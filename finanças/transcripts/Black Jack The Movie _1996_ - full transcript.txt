An incredible world record has been set. Seven meters cleared! The first time ever! Nicholas Doris, the star from out of nowhere! On the verge of retirement... a remarkable comeback. Superjump! The Lord giveth... to foolish mankind, a shining road to choose... It's unbelievable! Her time is faster than the men's world record! 9.61 seconds! An incredible new record in the women's 100m! Doctor! Doctor! Isn't it fantastic? All these new world records! Super records one after another! So what? Well... It's time to leave. Everyone but you is so excited about the Olympics! You have a temperature. Doctor. I'll be away for 3 days. Take an aspirin every 4 hours. Pinoko over and out. The winner of the 100m is a 15 year old girl. - I feel great! - No doubt! In the men's 400m freestyle, a miracle is about to happen! 25 seconds shaved with 100m to go. Another world record! Another super record has been made! - Heparin, 3mg. - It's in. - Fill with lactate. - OK. Scalpel. There's the tumor. Tumor removed. A stupendous Olympic Games. Marking the way to 21st century achievements! Ten unbelievable new records were set in events... including athletics, field and swimming. Doctor Black Jack. Here's your fee for your operation. $ 150,000. I usually prefer a bank transfer. But obviously you don't want to leave... evidence of your hospital's involvement with me. Look at those muscles working! Heights once thought to be physically impossible. We're seeing them live. All experts believe that... there are physical limits to the human body's capabilities. But that belief is now being challenged. Are these the people we have dreamt of for the 21st century? And if that's the case, it means... the birth of Super-Humans. Super-Humans! We're seeing a major spurt in human evolution. We're witnessing the birth of the Super-Humans! Darn! Doctor! The phone is ringing! If you wish to be examined, please leave your name, place, medical condition and the amount of payment. We will contact you. 0880-258-710 1... Please call me. I am preparing a check in your name, Doctor. That's her 5th call. 0880-258-7101. I memorized it! Won't you call her? No name and no medical history. No reason to call her. If you say so... Two years have passed since the Olympics. In the intervening two years the Super-Humans have... reached beyond the world of sports, into music, art and literature. In physics and science... In all fields of human endeavor new limits have been set. My name is Roger Siegel. You may remember me. Two years ago you operated on my daughter, Lisa. She's had a relapse! A relapse? But everything went perfectly. Doctor, we need your help! It's not possible. Thank God you're here, Doctor! She's in critical condition! Bring my medicines! Got it! This and this... Why isn't she in the hospital? She was only released yesterday. Five days ago she was well. "Just needs rest", they said. Call an ambulance! Doctor... Doctor Black Jack. You're also a Super-Human. I'm sure you can cure me. No mistake, it was a relapse. You can see the tumor here. But it wasn't malignant. The biopsy was correct. I don't believe this. I know how you feel. But Lisa was an exception. First she was bleeding from her colon. Then it progressed to renal failure. Next it was her blood. Finally, enlargement of the liver. There was no logical reason for any of it. I want to be at the autopsy. She died of heart failure. But the autopsy results were unbelievable. All of her internal organs, were in a totally unexpected condition. A fourteen year old girl had the organs... of a frail and worn-out 90 year old woman. Over the past two years, her body had aged some 80 years. When I operated on her two years ago, her internal organs were fresh and pink. Doctor, please wait. Please... Take this as our thanks. It was Lisa's last painting. I can't accept it. I couldn't save her. But Doctor, it would make us feel better. I'll return my fee of $ 150,000. Doctor. Come on, Pinoko. Take care! But it's such a wonderful painting. No one is available. If you wish to be examined, please leave your name, and details of your medical condition. 0880-258-7101. I'm expecting your call. My name is Jo Carol. Let us share a dream. At school I was always the smallest. I hated math and scored zero on my tests. I had no friends... I played alone down on the waterfront. At twelve, my mother abandoned my sister and me. But the mark I set at 7 meters, is the jump I have made from that childhood. As we approach the 21st century, a glorious future ahead... Let me ride on your dreams. Thank you! A round of applause for Super-Human Nicholas Doris! He's sweating heavily. I'll be back by morning. Sure. The Super-Human phenomenon ushers in a new age... Yes? We havejust learned... He is here in New York. In New York? He checked into the Royal Hotel 3 days ago. He's conducting an operation at 8 o'clock tonight. Which hospital? St. Kilda's Hospital. Data check. Pulse is steady at 60. BP is 100/ 50. You'll have to go in through the lungs. Let me do it. No way. You'll damage the lymph nodes. Don't! You're very good with a scalpel. But no one interferes when I'm operating. What's the meaning? First explain why you don't return my calls. 0880-258-7101. So fiinally I get to meet you. The unlicensed but famed Dr. Black Jack. You're very persistent. That's because I need your help. I must refuse. Without even asking why? I never give reasons why I accept or refuse. That is a problem. Your daughter feels differently. What's that? She's left the Royal Hotel for a vacation with my associate. Pinoko? Royal Hotel. Room 3012. One moment. It's interesting work. I refuse! 0880-258-7101. We'll take good care of your daughter. You'll be the one to save the Super-Humans. Save the Super-Humans? Doctor, we have guests. I'm busy. Tell them I'm out. I'm sorry, he's not here. No mistake! Yes, Doctor, we have searched for you. Here are our business cards. Art dealers? Since we learned the picture was in your possession, we have searched high and low for you. I'll pay $250,000! I'll pay $500,000! I'll pay cash. That's enough! Go away! Why is it worth so much? You don't know? The young girl who painted it... Works by Super-Humans are in much demand. I want an explanation. Want your steak rare, or medium-rare? Her name is Jo Carol. Chief Scientist's office, St. Joel Research Center. Be at the Center tomorrow at 11. It's easier to explain if you see the patients. Patients? Yes, there are 20 of them. All Super-Humans? Just remember this, Pinoko's safety comes before any contract. He's here. Let him in. First, let me assure you about Pinoko. Hi, Doctor! How are you? I'm having great fun! I'm having a lovely time here in Hawaii. I wanted you to come, too. But urgent work suddenly came up, right? Good luck! This morning we transferred $2 million to your bank account. Look. That's Nicholas Doris! Yes, the pole vault Olympic gold medallist. Bring up a thermograph and his data. Yes, ma'am. He's severely dehydrated. A typical symptom of this condition. This case is even worse. He's losing 50cc's of blood a minute. If we stop the transfusions... he'll bleed to death within 30 minutes. He's a musical genius and has been here for 6 months. Another gold medalist. Born in Eastern Europe, she didn't run until she was 12 years old. Suddenly at 13 she set a new world record. An Olympic entrant at 15. Then she ran 9.61 in the finals. She beat the men's record. But now she's here... She has diarrhea and is severely anorexic. We need your help. You're the only one who can save them. Please help me. Two years ago, when the Super-Humans first emerged. The world has changed. The sports heroes and geniuses have all... fallen to an unknown disease. They're secretly held at this research center. We've had a total of forty patients. Seventeen have already died. Just counting the ones we know, there are 1,230 of these Super-Humans in the world. One of these was a patient of yours. Lisa Siegel? Yes. This is your room. 1,230, you said? Yes. And they'll all fall victim? Those 1,230 are only the ones we know of. There could be ten times that many. So that's it... Super-Humanism is actually a disease. The disease attack the organs, the nerves, the blood and every cell in the body. Leading to massive organ failure and death. We have called the condition the Moira Syndrome. Moira Syndrome? From the Greek goddess who spins the threads of life. We wish to find a cure for the disease. But it must be a secret. We must avoid a panic. Let me introduce... Doctor Black Jack. He will join our project starting today. Professor Michigan from Kent Sate. I've heard a lot about you. Some years ago, you carried out... a glioblastoma that they said was impossible. Dr. Els, the eminent bacteriologist. - Pleased to meet you. - My pleasure. Dr. Takemoto, a neurologist from Tokyo. The brain surgeon, Dr. Eric Caderry. He'll join your team. Here is your assistant, Miss Betty McCall. A first class anesthesiologist. - Pleased to meet you. - My pleasure. I have a question. Is it true you're unlicensed, yet you charge astronomical fees? It's true. He brags about it! Emergency in room 12! I can still run! Let me go! That first night at 2... 35 am, the gold medallist, Ellen Shryer, died. After 17 short years of life, the girl who set the 9.6 1 record, ran into a wall and killed herself. Give the peace sign. Popcorn with caramel. Where did you go today? The zoo, Fantasy Park and Sea World. I want to ride the star-rocket. All right, let's both ride it. As for Dr. Black Jack, he's busy with his latest research. Is he eating well? Don't worry. There are people taking care of him. He still has some very difficult work to do. Sometimes he needs a break from my care. I really do spoil him far too much. Ellen's autopsy report. Bring up the data on her liver. Enlarge the image. All organs show signs of advanced aging. Her death was only a matter of time. The adrenal gland shows advanced aging, and is considerably swollen. The colon is half-rotted through. The organs rot within the body while they're alive. Her brain scan. Unlicensed, is he? I chose the best man for the job. The best also brings danger with it. He could cause trouble. You don't need to worry. The MSJ are investigating. You'd better be careful they don't come here. Don't worry. Your eyes are so cold. They're unbearable. We're running out of time! Brane Pharmaceuticals? It's true. You don't know anything. This entire research center, from the land to the salaries, are all paid for by Brane Pharmaceuticals. All of the doctors in our team, have some sort of ties to Brane. That woman, Miss Jo Carol. Her full name is Jo Carol Brane. Adopted daughter of the chairman. She's the undisputed head of this whole facility. The patient in room 7 is fibrillating. Prepare to operate. Dr. Black Jack will operate. An honor, sir. How's the anesthetic? Stable, he's ready to go. All ready, Doctor. I have an hypothesis... on the mechanism of the Moira Syndrome. The patients all share one common condition. They're all Super-Humans. None of them were born into that condition. What causes them to suddenly develop such talents? What is the bodily mechanism? I suspect it is a result of endorphins... coming from the hypothalamic regions of the brain-stem. It's known as a natural narcotic and high levels in the body... cause concentration level to rise. Extraordinary talents develop. If these high concentrations continue, the organs would shatter. I suspect something in the pituitary gland is responsible. You'd like to take a look? Exactly. Amazing. You found this out after only a week? It's only a theory. I'll call a staff meeting. Wait. What's Brane's involvement in this? You've told me nothing. Brane Pharmaceuticals is a major company... but this facility is donated to health research. It's totally non-profit. I agree with your basic premise, but with the brain stem, one slip can prove fatal. That's why Dr. Black Jack should operate. Have you chosen the patient? The operation is at eight tomorrow. Nicholas Doris. I see. Take a look at this. It's very important. Stop the project? Yes, I'll let you know when to start again. Keep the minimum needed to operate. Send everyone else back home. When will we re-start? At longest about six months, but hopefully one month. Cease all operations! Stop those machines. Make it hotter. I'm Dr. Black Jack. I'll operate on you tomorrow. Will I ever jump again? So far you've removed my stomach, opened my heart, taken out my blood and liver. So many operations. But I still can't even hold my pole. Next it's my brain! I'm no guinea pig! Didn't you agree to this operation? Yes. With the following condition. If the operation fails, please erase my memory. The glory of that 7 m. Jump is too much to bear. You don't want to contact your family? I don't want them to see me like this. There's a statue of me in my home town. Have you looked at it yet? No, not yet. Fools! You'll stop his breathing. I'm sorry, he's dead. Prepare the next patient. I refuse to operate. It's too dangerous. Continue. We need data while they're still alive. Their experimental operation is totally unforgivable. Probably on Super-Humans who were not on the list. No matter the reasons, no one has the right to experiment on living people. Tell me what's going on! MSJ investigation. In the interest of medical ethics, we're taking control. Did you check the evidence? We're the fighting doctors from the MSJ. We're a volunteer group of doctors... who rescue the weak from unscrupulous governments... and other entities. Arrest the leader. Miss Jo Carol Brane. You'd better hurry. Attention all doctors and nurses. This facility has been occupied by members of the MSJ. We'll be in charge of the entire facility for the time being. Our main purpose is to protect patients... and offer sound medicine care. All those who wish to help, come forward. We will gladly accept you into our ranks. To avoid outside interference and pressure, all those who resist will be taken into custody. Doctor. We can count on your cooperation, can't we? We need your expertise. Jo Carol. Number 7101. I warned you to be careful of the MSJ. I expected trouble at the factory... so I closed down operations. It's well-known that your staff has been infiiltrated by the MSJ. Pressure the mayor to bring in the national guard. Without that, our research will stop. No, they'd learn far too much. If your experiments become known, we're finished. They won't find much. What is it that's made you so insane, 7101? Your project is over. Forever! Please wait, Mr. Brane! You're relieved of your position. MSJ American Bridge Leader, Thomas Johnson. I'm a psychiatrist based in Vancouver. We'll begin the operation at 8pm tonight. Certainly, Doctor. Is this a CT-scan of Nicholas? There is some very important information I must tell you... before you operate. We have evidence that all the Moira Syndrome patients... have had some link to Brane Co. Over the past 5 years. A link? Brane operates over 300 hospitals in 60 cities worldwide. All patients here have been treated at those facilities. Unfortunately, none of the patients have agreed to talk. If we can get one to speak up, the WHT will agree to step in. We must learn what Brane has been up to. You expect Nicholas to tell you? If there's a chance... Saving his life comes first. Let's begin. Well, Fendy? Any changes? Not at all. I have tickets. Go to the airport. Certainly, ma'am. I'll meet you later. Get a room with a view. We're going to the Mediterranean? Brain wave? No change. Something around here, the hypothalamus. I suspected an abnormality. So I cut there. I was sure I'd find something. The reason was, I'd seen the same scalpel marks... on the evidence from the diskette. The average surgeon wouldn't operate on the pituitary... unless a life was in danger. Slip one millimeter... and the patient would be dead. But still, I went in. I gambled on my skills. With less than a 1% chance of success... 150% effort can bring victory. There's nothing abnormal here. Good color and shape, too. Prepare for electric fibrillation. I saw them do that on the diskette. When the shock was applied... something in the brain glowed. It wasn't very clear, but something flashed from the pituitary. Ready, Doctor. Start at 50 joules. Crank it up another 25. Up to 75 joules. Up 75 joules. That's it! A tumor? Scalpel. Have this tested immediately. The results, Doctor. It can't be! Doctor, he's regained consciousness! Blood pressure is at 100/ 60. Pulse rate is 90. The operation was a success. It's too early to say. The patient is still not back to normal. Am I no longer a Super-Human? We don't know yet. We removed something from your pituitary. It stimulated the gland to produce overdoses of endorphins. I'm no longer a Super-Human. The constant burning sensation is gone. I don't want to be normal! What did Brane Pharmaceuticals do to you? Endorph-A... 710 1. You were just one point away from failing. You need to work harder. There must be... Surely there is... My own path in life. I knew you'd try to contact me. I'm glad I stayed in New York. Of course. You still have Pinoko. She's fine. Believe me. You have no choice. Please, sit down. You'll get Pinoko back. I'm not stupid enough to make you my enemy. I've long wanted to work alongside you. Then and now. I'll never work with people who conduct living experiments. I found this in his brain. It's a new virus. A virus? It's probably what is causing the Moira Syndrome. A virus, no wonder we couldn't find it. It was in behind the lateral exon. I only discovered it by chance. Where did the virus come from? Tell me what it is you're hiding. Here's to your discovery! What is Endorph-A? It's a new drug that I developed. A drug? Please, drink up. It's lonely drinking alone. Endorph-A... It stimulates the brain to over-produce endorphins... which creates the Super-Humans. This is Endorph-A concentrate. I began this Endorph-A project 5 years ago. Two years ago it was proven at the Olympics. Everything went perfectly. So they were just experiments to you? To ensure the best results... we selected very ordinary people as subjects. We contracted with each of them for a fantastic sum. How many? At first it was only 20. But the rumor spread. It could pass any of the doping tests. It was a dream drug. In the end we had 153 people under contract. Liar! At least 1,230 of them are on your list! We couldn't believe it ourselves. Then it began to induce progressive multiple organ failure. For some reason it appeared contagious. It's a virus, of course it is contagious. It's a death-drug! Paying them gives you no right to kill! Don't you feel any sense of responsibility? You'll never be forgiven! Jo Carol Brane! You caused this disease! But there's still hope. If the virus can be neutralized; its effects minimized... Endorph-A will be the new super drug! What? Black Jack, Black Jack! You and I are fated to fight the Moira Syndrome together. Which of us will catch it first? I put some Endorph-A into the wine we just shared. The Brane Co. was raided today by the Medical Soldiers for Justice. As a result, the ministry, and various international bodies have begun to move. Some Moira Syndrome patients were rescued. I knew nothing of it! Do those making these charges have a shred of proof? Any evidence will prove the New Drug Group is responsible. They're saying that you're ill. I'm a little feverish. - A cold? - No, I'm just tired. An insider from Brane. A member of their development team. He was Jo Carol's immediate assistant. He's agreed to talk in return for immunity. It began six years ago. At a car endurance rally. 20 days in the broiling Serbian desert. One of the drivers was Michael Jean. Somehow Michael became lost in the desert. He was rescued some two weeks later. His navigator was dead... Michael miraculously survived. But the real miracle became apparent later. He began racing F 1's. His driving was superb. Out of 16 world championships, Michael won 10. Only a year earlier he was a B-grade rally-driver. Jo Carol Brane was the first to notice it. She made contact with him. He was thoroughly examined. We found he was producing vast amounts of endorphins. Ten times the normal output. We found something else there, too. Something from the sand... Some kind of fungus. Or maybe an eumycetes. We searched the Serbian desert. The rally route and where he'd gotten lost. Deep in the interior, we found it mixed in with the sand. We collected the sand, and separated it from the sand. We refined it and purified it. Then we had a test sample of Endorph-A. Do you know how many your drug has killed? I didn't know! We never knew there was a virus! Hello, Jo! You made it! Yes, I did. Hello, Miss. You're looking well. So beautiful! Don't work too hard, Doctor. I miss you but I'm being strong about it. I miss you so much. I really do. - Is she asleep? - Yes. - Miss... - What? The chairman has issued an order to everyone. I'm so pleased. You've done a good job. I've served you for 10 years. I'll finish by taking Pinoko back to Dr. Black Jack. An order to destroy all evidence. Please understand, Fendy. I have unfinished work to do. - Is Fendy working? - Yes, she is. Did she say anything? Don't eat or drink too much and easy on the TV. She always says that! I'll say it from now on. 0880-258-710 1. This number is either out of range... or else it is switched off. Please try again later. We're doing our best, too, but there's no sign of her. My temperature is up to 38.7 degrees Celsius. Let's go to the airport. It's due to the Endorph-A, I'm sure. If it is... Jo Carol drank more than I did. She must be worse off. I'm ready to go! What a lovely dress. You, too. You look like a super-model. Thank you. Let's go to the dinner party. Hurry, it's started! Jo! Flight 63 to Serbia is on schedule, sir. Doctor, the records you were looking for. We pulled them out of the garbage. Infected Persons Tracking Report? Lisa Siegel's case history. 1990... Attended Parker Hospital for acute anemia treatment. '92, received transfusions at Parker. '94, ordered to infuse her with blood taken... from an Endorph-A infected monitor. Ordered to? '96 Lisa's internal organs began to deteriorate. The possibility of blood infection is very high. '98, patient deceased. Doctors in charge... Michael Salon, John Richardson, Judy Austin, Ralph Geiss, and the unlicensed doctor, Kuro Hazama, AKA Dr. Black Jack. For further details about Black Jack, contact chief surgeon, Jo Carol. We'll be there by night. I'm not very familiar with Serbia, but it's my second country. My mother is American, and my father is Serbian. That was Tanje village, the last one. From here on there are only the nomads. Desert nomads? Yes, a small tribe that has retained their culture. Very few people have seen them. The villagers call them "gods of the desert." In order to camouflage that it's a pharmaceutical factory, they've disguised it as an oil refinery. Such an enormous facility here in the desert. Doctor, what is it? This way! Pinoko! Doctor! Pinoko... Where's Jo Carol? She's... Jo is in big trouble. Don't! You should be in bed! You have a bad fever. Thanks, Pinoko. But I must keep working. I don't have much time. You created the disease. Enjoy the suffering. I thought you'd come. All right. Let's begin. First a method to cure Moira Syndrome. Next we create an even more purer form of the super drug, Neo-Endorph-A! Stay back! You'll catch Moira if it touches you. Take care of Pinoko. Go somewhere safe and wait for me. But Doctor, won't you be exposed to Moira? I am already infected with it. Go now! We don't want any new victims! The fools. Aren't they afraid of Moira? A Brane Co. Facility, all right. All the medicine and equipment you could hope for. It's possible to do basic research here, too. I plan to go into your pituitary, and remove the virus from there. If I were you I wouldn't operate on me. I have one question. Was it you who decided to... infect Lisa with the blood from the monitor? Yes, it was me. But why? If you don't like my answer, will you slip with your scalpel and turn me into a vegetable? I just may do that. I was confident, and I was full of hope. At that time I came across Lisa Siegel... at the Brane Co. 's Parker Hospital. I was so confident of Endorph-A. None of the test cases had shown bad effiects. The drug was drawing out all these wonderful talents. When I first saw Lisa, I realized she was a Super-Human. A child of the 21st century. Blue eyes and chestnut hair... Same as me when I was 12 years old. I wanted to give her 'happiness. ' And maybe get from her the childhood I never had. You chose her at random, without her consent, and you experimented on her? What made you to do it? Everybody asks the same thing. What did you want from Lisa? - Doctor... - Doctor... I'll operate. The drug was taking effect. Deep in my brain, countless endorphins... were being produced at record rates. I had an extraordinary level of concentration. My sight was crystal clear. I could even see individual nerve cells. Even the platelets floating in her blood. No mistake, I'd become a Super-Human. So hot! I'm so hot! I'm burning up! The heat! All bodily functions have returned to normal. It's a success! Only 2 7 minutes for such a complex operation. - Doctor! - What's wrong? Where's the doctor? Where is he? Why... Why won't you just abandon me? This way you'll die, too. No matter what... you're my patient. Doctor! Jo! Doctor! A little more to the northwest. There's something I want you to see. Just over that sandhill. Let me down. This is the Endorph-A sand. We refined these crystals, and made the medicine. The other researchers said it was... either a fungus or some sort of moss. But I knew otherwise. It was not from here. It was brought here on the wind. You mean a pollen or a spore? There's a field of flowers up ahead somewhere. The wind roils through here, so we haven't found it. But one day I will. Mission accomplished. Please believe me... I didn't create Endorph-A to make money for Brane. I wanted to help people develop their true talents. I was sick of people who only looked at things... rationally and scientifically. You're right. First time you've agreed with me. But what you did was very foolish. It was my best effort. There was no other way... My real name is 7101. I was a test-tube baby created by the Brane Co. They made 30 of us from a batch ofi selected sperm and ova. But only I was adopted by Mr. Brane himself. I was put into a very strict regime of study, almost like a jail. Over five years the thirty dropped to 20. Next it was 10, then 5... No time to say good bye. they just suddenly disappeared. Perhaps they were all killed. My childhood was full of fear. My heart gradually hardened. All I thought about was winning. In place of a heart I developed a hard, cold block of ice around me. When only I remained, Brane adopted me. I went to the best universities, and I lived luxuriously. But the ice in my heart did not melt. I always felt cold. Probably bleeding from the stomach. Losing 50 cc of blood a minute, Moira terminal stages. My sight is getting dim. My heart is beginning to flutter. Am I dying? My pulse is getting weaker. I'm dying. What can I do before I lose consciousness? Concentrate. For who... For you, Black Jack. Me...? What is it? Fuluzium. Fuluzium. Fuluzium? This is the fuluzium, a flower we discovered in Serbia. Moira Syndrome was caused by a virus in the flower. But having hosted the virus for so long, the flower had developed a resistance. First we extracted the essence from the stems, and administered it to the patients. This effectively cured the Moira Syndrome. This was taught to us by the Serbian desert nomads. For many thousands of years, they were aware that the pollen was poison. They also knew the cure. However, they warned me. Over the past 10 years Fuluzium poison has increased! The mother desert has sickened rapidly. Surely not the desert alone has suffered? If a 2nd or 3rd wave of Moira Syndrome occurs... No! It is surely happening somewhere right now! Betty, look. We'll get out here. Doctor! Doctor Black Jack! Have you thought about what I asked you earlier? What was it again? Please join the MSJ. Even as an advisor. - Did you hear that? - First time. Don't be like that! Sorry, I have a patient waiting. - Doctor! - Please! There are many ways for a man to do what must be done. Doctor... - Bye. - See you.
