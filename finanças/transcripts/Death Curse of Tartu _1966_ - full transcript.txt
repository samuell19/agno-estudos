(Scraping) (♪ Chanting and drumming) (Whooping) (♪ Rapid drumming) This looks like the spot all right. OK, Billy, let's unload . Phew! We'll set up over there on the high ground . I'm sorry, Mr. Gunter, but as I told you before, I can't go beyond this point. Don't tell me you believe those ridiculous stories about evil spirits and witch doctors that turn themselves into giant alligators and all that rubbish? I'm sorry, but I'm afraid I do. Billy, I'd believe this of your grandfather, perhaps even your father, but you? You forget. . . I am a Seminole. You're an intelligent, educated man. You surely don't believe in ghosts? I only know one thing, Mr. Gunter. Ever since I was a little boy, I have seen my people bring back the bodies of dead men who have invaded the sacred burial ground . I myself have heard the drums and the voices of the ancient Indians that lie buried here. Hey, this is hard to believe. It's hard to believe that. . . Just listen. Look around you . Have you ever seen a hammock this quiet? (Wind whistles) You've been in the Everglades long enough to know that hammocks like this one are filled with birds and the countless sounds of living things that are native to these mounds. What are you trying to say? Look around you . Can you explain why everything has left? (Snorts) If I listen to you , you'll have me believing in witches and goblins. Our agreement was that I was to bring you here and then leave. That I have done. Now, may I return to the village? Either you . . . - All right, I can't argue with evil spirits. - Thank you , Mr. Gunter. (Gunter sighs) Billy. . . you think you can get an airboat up into here? H m-mm . The water's deep enough this year. - I think it could be done. - Good . When Mr. and Mrs. Tison arrive at the village, have them come out on an airboat, that way they can carry more supplies. Yes, sir. And , Billy, you'd better take this map. Mr. Tison'll need it. - Mr. Gunter? - Yeah? Please. . . please be careful . H uh! Don't worry, Billy. Any ghost that bothers me will have his hands full . (♪ Chanting and drumming) (Whooping) (♪ Rapid drumming) (♪ Drumming) (Groaning) (Birds chirruping) (Engine approaching) Well , Billy. . . how's my favorite guide? Fine, Mr. Tison. Good to see you . How did you and Sam make out yesterday? We worked our way to the burial mound OK, and unloaded the canoe. Did you spend the night out there? No, sir. Oh? I know what I'm going to tell you is going to sound strange, Mr. Tison, but frankly I'm afraid to set foot on that burial mound . You afraid? Now that's hard to believe. - True. That mound is haunted . - Come on, Billy, you're not serious? Never been more serious in my life, Mr. Tison. Well , explain yourself. The drums, the chanting, for one thing. I've been on many a hunting trip that took us out in the vicinity, and at night we would hear these weird sounds. . . . . .drums and warriors chanting. Drums? Chanting? I don't follow you . Ed? Should we unload the wagon? Yes, Julie, start unloading! I'll be with you in a minute! I'm sorry. Now look, Billy, the human brain is very mysterious. Sometimes it makes us see things that don't exist, and hear things that never were. How do you explain the people that were killed , then? Killed? What do you mean? Twenty years ago, my father and I took two duck hunters out to the mound . We left them there overnight. We returned in the morning. Both were dead , killed by a tiger. A tiger? No, Billy, there's no tigers in Florida. That's right. But the footprints, the fur in the dead man's hand , everything pointed to a tiger. Now look, Billy, even if those men did die by a tiger, how does that make the mound haunted? My grandfather and the elder members of my tribe say that, 400 years ago, a witch doctor named Tartu had the power to turn himself into a wild creature. When he died , he swore if anyone would disturb the burial ground , he would change himself into a wild beast and kill them . Billy, you're an intelligent man, you've been educated . . . I know. That's what Mr. Gunter said . But I'm still an Indian. And call it what you like, stupidity or superstition, what have you , I still believe something evil is haunting that mound . Well , Billy, you're entitled to an opinion. - But do me a favor, huh? - Yes? Don't say anything to Julie and the others. You know why? I've waited all year for this archaeology trip and I just don't want the daylights scared out of them before we even leave. Whatever you say, Mr. Tison. By the way, Mr. Gunter gave me this map to give to you . He said use airboats instead of canoes. U h. . . I'm sorry I won't be with you this trip. I'll sure miss your company. (Car horn blasts) They're getting impatient already. We better get going, huh? Can you show me which airboats to use? Sure. I'll help you load up. - Hello, Billy, how are you? - Fine, Mrs. Tison. We've been looking forward to going on this trip with you . Are you ready to go? Well , you see, I . . . U h, Billy had already hired out to some hunters and he couldn't break the appointment. Oh, I'm sorry. We'll miss you . Ed , do you think it's safe to go into the Glades without a guide? Now, Julie, I didn't spend four years out in the air force as a navigator to end up getting lost out here in the Glades. Oh, my apologies, sir. The water's deep enough in the Glades, but as you get near the mound , you might have to push the boat into the hammock. - We're all unloaded , Mr. Tison. - OK, let's go. (Engine grinds) Sorry, kids, the soft ride is over! From here on, we push! Get in that water. Push! (Engine revs) (Engine stops) H i ! Hey! Hey, hello! Come on! (Julie) Come on, get in the water! - Oh, what? - (Julie) You'll get your boots wet anyway! - (Ed) Snakes won't hurt you , come on! - (Julie) Get in! (Ed) Come on, come over here! Come with us. - (Woman) In there? - (Man) Ladies first. Come on, get in the water! You're gonna get your boots wet anyway! - (Ed) Snakes won't hurt you ! Come on! - (Julie) Get in! Come on, you chickens! Let's go! Come on, you chicken! That's strange. I hope we're in the right place. Mr. Tison, look! There's footprints. Here's where they dragged the canoe up on shore. Do you think anything could be wrong? Why, no. Sam's probably preoccupied . He didn't hear me, that's all . Where do you think Mr. Gunter set up camp? He probably pitched his tent up on the high ground . Come on! - Oh, no! - There's no seats! - There'd better be. - There are no seats. Come on. Oh, I'm sorry. Sam ! Sam Gunter! Can you hear me? Sam ! Can you hear me? - Oh! - Julie! Julie, what is it? Julie, now calm down. Knowing Sam Gunter, it's probably one of his practical jokes. Some joke. It even scares me. This place is too creepy for me. Now how in the world are you people gonna study archaeology, if you're afraid of a little skull? Look at it! Feel it! It's only bone. No harm can come to you . There's no evil spirit hiding in there. - What's the matter? - Shh! - What's that? - What's what? Listen. (Wind gusting) Listen! Well , can't you hear it? It sounds like. . . . . .drums. Drums? - I don't hear anything but the wind . - I think I heard some drums. Now, come on, kids. That's your imagination playing tricks on you . Now come on, let's go find Sam . Sam ! Sam , are you here? Ed . . . I'm scared . Well , something strange is going on here and I . . . Keep your voice down. I don't want a bunch of panicky kids on my hands. But what about Sam? He should be here. Mr. Tison, do you have any idea where Mr. Gunter is? Well , uh. . . He probably spotted a deer and set out tracking him . But wouldn't he leave a note or something? Look, Johnny, by the time Sam wrote a note, the deer would 1 0 miles from here. . . Hey, look here! - Look at this weird writing. - What luck! - Sam must've found it yesterday. - What's it say, Mr. Tison? Well , I can't translate it as fast as, say, Latin, but I'll work on it tonight and I'll be able to pick out the general meaning. - Man, this is groovy. - Now, what did I tell you? Wait until we find other Indian signs, then you really won't wanna leave here. Well , what are we wasting time for? - Why don't we start digging now? There's plenty of time. Let's go set up camp first. - We'll start first thing in the morning. - Let's go! Mr. Tison? Is it alright if we walk down to the lake and roast a few marshmallows? - What's wrong with this fire? - Well , we just, uh. . . OK, Johnny, go ahead . But be careful . Thanks, Mr. Tison. What was that all about? The kids wanted to go down the lake and roast marshmallows. Oh, should you have let them? Marshmallows was just an excuse. It wasn't long ago that you also wanted to be alone under a beautiful moon. - Oh, Ed Tison, you're terrible! - No, seriously. I sent them away because I had to talk to you . Is it about Sam? Frankly, I'm terribly worried . - What could've happened to him? - Well , any number of things. The Everglades are full of wild creatures. He could've wandered off camp, gotten lost. - What can we do? - Nothing tonight. We start first thing in the morning. If we don't find him , we'll . . . just have to go back to the village and call the police. Were you able to translate the tablet? That's another reason why I wanted them out of here. Why? Ed , what is it? - See those markings? - Mm-hm . This one means ''witch doctor''. The rest of the symbols tell a story how this witch doctor, whose name was Tartu , swore he'd come back from the dead . change himself into wild creatures and kill anybody that came to disturb his burial ground . Oh, Ed , how. . . how frightening. Frightening, yes. But sheer nonsense. Anyone that believes in that should believe in ghosts and goblins and wicked witches and the like. - Now you're just making fun of me. - Not at all . I'm just pointing out that this is the 20th century. I . . . I know you're right. But nevertheless, old Tartu has sent a shiver up my spine. From the grave.

(Laughing) Come on. - What's that? - I don't know. What's going on? - It's a shark! - Tommy, look out! - Joann! Tommy! - A shark! A shark! Swim ! (Cindy) Swim ! Tommy, swim ! (Johnny) Swim , Tommy! Joann, swim ! Swim ! Come on! Quickly! (Screams) (Screams) It's got him ! - What was that? - What was what? - Listen. . . - (Distant screaming) Come on. - Tommy! - Joann, swim !

(Weeping) My God , Mr. Tison. . . it doesn't seem possible. It isn't possible. Sharks don't live in fresh water. It's no use. They've disappeared . We better head back to the village, Mr. Tison. Let me try once more. I think I've got something. Oh, Johnny, how awful ! (Distant drumming) It's the drums! Where are they coming from? We're not waiting to find out. Johnny, go to the airboats, warm them up. I'll join you there. Yes, sir. Mr. Tison! Mr. Tison! Forget everything else. Let's get going! Mr. Tison! Mr. Tison! The. . . the airboats. . . - What is it? - Something. . . - What? - . . .destroyed them . They're. . . they're sunk. Holes. . . holes. . . in the bottom . - And it looks like alligator teeth marks. - Oh, Ed , what do we do? We can't just stay here, waiting to die! We've got to get away! Cindy, if we panic now, then we'll be of no use to each other or ourselves. Now, we've got to think. Someone or something. . . is trying to destroy us. What can it be, Mr. Tison? (♪ Chanting and drumming) Johnny. . . Things exist on this planet. . . that scientists have no answer to. In fact. . . . . .there are many things that even defy science. True, we send our astronauts into space. . . . . . but right here on our own planet, there are still hundreds of questions unanswered . The sea, for example. We travel thousands of miles into outer space, and yet man hasn't explored the depth of the sea here on our own earth. But we're not under the sea, Mr. Tison, we're on good solid earth! First, Mr. Gunter disappears. And then a shark, which doesn't inhabit fresh water, attacks Joann and Tommy. Something, God knows what, destroys our airboats. And always the sound of those wild drums and chanting. A tiger in the Everglades. . . - What did you say? - U h. . . just something Billy told me. - Tartu . . . - Tartu? - The only explanation is Tartu . - (Johnny) What's that? Last night, I broke down the symbols on that tablet. They were written by an Indian witch doctor named Tartu . He wrote he would come back from the dead . Transform himself into wild creatures. He swore he would come back and kill anybody who tried to disturb this burial ground . Tommy and Joann might've been alive if you had told us! Oh, Cindy, I didn't know. How could anyone suspect there was even an element of truth in that stone tablet? You should've warned us! You should've told us! I wish to heaven I had . If this is true, if we're dealing with the supernatural , what can we do to protect ourselves? Our only chance is to get away from this mound . I've got to go for help! I'm sure the women would feel safer if you stayed with them . - I'll go. - No, Johnny, don't leave me! - Take me with you ! - It's 25 miles to civilization, Cindy. You'd never make it. Johnny will need every ounce of his strength to get through the Glades. - You'd only be an anchor around his neck. - Now, hold on! It's not established yet whether Johnny or I will go. Mr. Tison, if anything further were to happen here, you'd be more able to handle it than I . Besides, I'm in good shape from track practice, I can make that 25 miles in record time. Oh, Ed , he's right. Alright, Johnny. But you better get going. Travel light. Only the machete and a few cans of food . Good luck, Johnny. Be careful . Take care. Oh, Johnny. . . take the map. And . . . And the compass. Now, head due south until you hit the Tamiami Trail . Good luck. Now hurry. (Distant drumming) The drums. It's those drums again. (♪ Drumming and chanting) (♪ Drumming and chanting continue) (Screams) Aargh! Johnny! Johnny! Cindy, what is it? He's dead ! Johnny's dead ! There, there, you just had a nightmare, nothing more. No, no, no! It wasn't a dream ! He's dead . I saw it all , just as though I was there. It was awful ! - What's wrong? - She just dreamed Johnny was killed . Now, Cindy, knowing Johnny like I do, he's probably only a few miles away from the Tamiami Trail right now. He's a strong boy, he can take care of himself. No! He was bitten in the face by a snake! A snake that came from Tartu's cave! That's just your mind playing tricks, Cindy. - Now pull yourself together. - No! It was all so clear! As though Tartu was telling me himself! Now, Cindy, hear me! Pull yourself together. There's only one answer to this puzzle. I thought about it all night. If that tablet is genuine, if by some strange freak of nature, a supernatural being can transform himself into wild creatures. . . . . .then we must search out his burial spot, and destroy the physical remains of his body. But, Ed , you . . . you sound as if you believe this prophecy. It's not a matter of whether I believe it or not. I studied that tablet last night. It says the only way that Tartu can be silenced is by Mother Nature. . . . . .destroying the physical remains of his reincarnated body. But this sounds like a dream . Like a chapter out of a. . . a horror magazine. To satisfy our own curiosity and to erase this from our minds, I feel we must search out his burial spot. But, Ed , Johnny should be here with help by tonight. Mr. Tison, help isn't coming. It was all too clear to be just a dream . Johnny died before he could reach help. If we sit here and wait, it's only a matter of time until Tartu will destroy us all ! I'm for searching out Tartu's grave now! She's right, Julie. Well , it looks like I'm outvoted . When do we start? It's light enough now. Let's get going. If we could only find where Sam uncovered that tablet, the tomb's entrance must be nearby. Let's spread about six feet apart. Mr. Tison, look! It seems like somebody has been digging here. You're right. Look, Indian signs. (♪ Distant chanting and drumming) Listen. . . It's the chanting again. It's coming from the ground below us. The tomb's entrance must be nearby. Oh, Ed , why don't we just forget about. . .? No, Julie, we've got to! It's our only chance. Now, come on, let's find that entrance. Ed? Ed , over here! Look. That must be it. Come on, let's pay Mr. Tartu a visit. (Screams) It's Sam Gunter. Horrible! Oh! (Screams) Cindy! Cindy, come back here! - The door is jammed ! - No! No, it can't be! Let me out! I gotta get out of here! Oh! Oh! (Groans) (Weeping) (Screams) (Cindy screaming) Ed , it's. . . it's Cindy. Oh, please! Oh, please let me in! (Screams) - Cindy! Cindy, what is it? - (Cindy) Open the door! - Cindy, can you hear me? - (Screaming) - (Screaming) - Something's wrong. She's screaming. Open the door! Open the door! (Screaming) Oh, it's no use. - What are you doing? - I have an idea. What? Hold that. If I can get enough powder out of this bullet. . . . . . maybe. . . maybe we'll be able to blow the door open. H urry, Ed . H urry! There you go. Hold it. I think we have enough now. Give it to me. OK. . . Here, Ed . This'll work. Now, Julie, get the flashlight and get back in the cave as far as you can. Come on, hurry! Stay down, Julie. Ed , I think. . . I think this is a casket. Julie, you're right. (Explosion) Come on. Come on! Cindy! Cindy, where are you? - Cindy! - Cindy! There are her footprints. Come on. Come on. (Wailing) - She's over there! - Hold on, Cindy, we're coming! (Screaming) H urry, Mr. Tison! I can't hold on! I can't hold on! I'm slipping! I'm slipping! H urry! H urry, Mr. Tison! (Screams) (Gunshot) Easy, easy. Tartu . . . Destroy. . . . . . him . (Groans) Julie, keep the light on the lid . Julie, would you get me the axe, please? It's no use. I need something stronger, like a wrecking bar, or something. Maybe Tartu . . . didn't exist. Well , how. . . how do you explain all the things that have happened? Who could've dragged Sam Gunter's body in here? I don't know, Julie. Maybe the tablet was wrong. Maybe. . . maybe I read it wrong. (Julie) But what about Cindy and Tommy, and Joann and . . . and . . .? (♪ Drumming and chanting stop) (Gunshot) (Roars) (Julie screams) Julie, reload the rifle! H urry! Julie, hurry! Fire it! (Screaming) Julie, run! Run! (Screams) (Screams) (Ed) Julie! Hold on, Julie! Julie! Hold on, Julie! Julie! Julie! (♪ Drumming and chanting) (Whooping) (Rapid drumming) (Drumming fades) Tartu's prophecy was that only Nature could destroy him . How right he was.
