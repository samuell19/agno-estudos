[MUSIC CONTINUES] MAN: [ON TV] Cruise night on Van Nuys Boulevard. It'’s a phenomenon. It is, however, not new. In fact, it started over 20 years ago when the local hot rod clubs would gather at a drive-in restaurant every Wednesday night. Now it'’s become a ritual-- Hey, come on. Wait a minute, let me watch this. I have to get home soon. My dad'’ll be wanting his car back. Excuse me. Al Zass, hi. Do you mind telling us exactly how you feel about cruise night? Not at all... What'’s it about? ZASS: ...it'’s time it stopped. It'’s about Van Nuys Boulevard in California. Look, a lot of wild things go on here. We'’ll stop it. Well, exactly how do you intend to do that? Lots of ways. We'’re going to start enforcing a curfew. There will be a 10:00 p.m. curfew for those under 18. We'’ll be enforcing this, we'’ll be taking the kids, we'’ll be spot-checking them and lockin'’ 'em up. REPORTER: Do you mean you'’ll send them to jail? ZASS: Not exactly jail. We'’ll take 'em down to the station, let '’em call their parents, you know, the younger ones anyway. Throws a little scare into '’em. On what grounds do you-- Anything we can find. Curfew ain'’t all. There'’s lots of things. There'’s drag racing, noisy mufflers. Look, these kids are wild. [LAUGHING] You understand what I'’m saying? You wouldn'’t believe what some of '’em get up to. And they ain'’t all kids, either. Thank you, Officer Zass. This is CPI News-- Hey, what'’d you do that for? I came here to see you, not to watch the damn television set. I ain'’t got much time.
