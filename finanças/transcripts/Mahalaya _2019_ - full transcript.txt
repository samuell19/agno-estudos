'The announcement of emergency' 'impacted the politics in the nation.' 'And the value of democracy was also realised.' 'Everything changed overnight on the 25th of June, 1975.' 'And 26th June, 1975 is know as the darkest day of India.' Good morning, sir. Good morning. Tea or coffee? No, sir, I just had my meal. What about the concert? I had finalized the date. I had asked you to coordinate with the artists. Sir, everything is done. Everyone has confirmed except... Except? Mr Nondo, this is emergency. This is not the time for exception. Execute or be executed. There's a small problem. Mr Ganguly is... He is the star attraction. Give him the final guest log. Sir, I will give it, but... He is reluctant to perform without remuneration. He is saying for money for a government program. Get him on the line. What? Put him on the phone. Hello! Just a minute, sir. Sir. Good Morning, Mr Kishore. I am Shashi from North block. "Yoodoole..." Excuse me? My south was blocked since morning. I am happy to hear that your north is blocked. So I sang a little in happiness. You won't understand the song. All of you are used to dancing. Mr Kishore, I had called you for the program on the 29th. You have a 45 minutes slot. Rs 70,000. What! You can pay Rs 65,000 in cash. Confirm with my secretary. Thank you. You're getting me wrong, Mr Kishore. It's a government initiative. It's an honor for you, not a favor to the government. Mr Sashi, do you hear Bengali songs? Mr Kishore, I'm too busy for silly songs and arguments. There are orders and request. There's no time for a request. It's an order from him. Then you leave the work of giving orders to the almighty. And understand the language first. I understand Bangla very well, Mr Kishore. - Okay. So you mean that you're not a rascal. Listen... You are making a mistake by refusing the request of the government. Mr Sashi, I deeply regret that I can swear on the call, but can't throw my shoe at you. Thank you. What did he say, sir? Insolence is not necessarily a bad thing. It's quite normal for genius people to be a little disrespectful. But it's dangerous if they bully us unnecessarily. Bad for health. Sir, he didn't agree? Sir, boss will be furious. You are his right hand. Amputate the hand that's not of use. Be it right or left. What's the solution, sir? Instruct Akashvani that henceforth none of Kishore Kumar's song should be played on the radio. He sings well, but is a bad element for these times. If he is not singing for boss, he will not be singing for anyone. Is it clear? Clear as water, sir. Good morning, Mr Banerjee. - Good morning. Big boss? - He arrived by 9.30. Okay. Was he asking for me? Not directly. But he was looking for the conciliation file... I mean the status... Go and keep my bag upstairs. Started their nonsense early in the morning? Can't bear these Indians. Why? - And you are just great. What do you mean? Because of oiled elements like you, Bengali's cannot progress. Oiled? Not oiled? Big boss will report at 9.30. And you feel guilty if you don't report by 9.15. Spreading the philosophy of Gandhi sitting on our head. Starting with the issue of political freedom, he is creating an issue with the reporting time now. It won't do without mixing the cultural spice. Cultural spice? Do you remember the date today? Or have you drowned your intelligence in the Yamuna river by becoming a Bengali residing at Delhi. Oh... You are saying that since it's Mahalaya? Don't take it so casually, Nondo. Don't take it so casually. What have Bengalis done after Ravindranath? Have they developed any constructive cultural element apart from the political issues and the poems in the newspaper. And if we are not able to patronize it then will there be a difference between a Bengali and that villager? Don't I patronize? No, you don't. Had you done it, you wouldn't have reported to office on time at office. Do you understand? What were you doing at 4 in the morning? Did you switch on the radio? Or were you working on your file in your dreams and flattering your boss? Slaying of Mahisashur? On Akashvani? No, this time... - You didn't hear it. Isn't it? - No. - I knew it. But you excitedly hear the songs of Rajesh Khanna on Vivid Bharti. It doesn't touch the sentiments of a Bengali. Where is the cultural identity of Bengalis other than the puja? Forget about all that. All that is past. The nucleus is Durga Puja and Mahalaya. The Chants recited by Mr Biren. It's like Kolkatta football without Mohan Bagan. It means... - What? About what? After Ravindranath, if there's a cult in Bengalis, it's Mahalaya. Understood? - Yes. Chants recited by Mr Biren, accompanied by music given by Mr Pankaj. One is bound to get goosebumps. Hair raising? Listen, Nondo. It's early morning, around 3.45. Lifting the mosquito net and placing the transistor. Your sister-in-law on your right and your nephew on your left. A muffler covering the neck. Mr Biren reciting the chants from the transistor. "On a winter morning in the month of Ashwin..." Wow! It moves you from within. Electric? Stop kidding, Nondo. Think about it. When this was originally composed in the year 1929... The recording that you hear now, Mahishasur Mardini, do you know when was it recorded? 1958. Just imagine. 1958. Can you imagine? The one above it. Is the fish fresh? Sir! Good morning. Please come here. How are you, Madhob? Your blessings, sir. I have good Rohu fish. Morola, Tengda. First cut the fish for me. How long do I wait? Two minutes. This gentleman works at the radio. Why are you worked up? Deal with him first. Yes, I am giving. - Excuse me, sir. Are you Mr Birendra? Yes. I mean... I am... - Don't. I usually buy fish here. I am your big fan. I felt I have heard your voice somewhere. You buy it. I will wait for 5 minutes. You can go first, so you... Don't worry. I work at the railway office. Even if I'm 5 minutes late, I won't get a notice from Mrs Gandhi. I am involved in the emergency. I am very fortunate to have met you. Just the thought excites me. Give him the fish before me. I am waiting. - I am giving. You are Birendro Krishno Bhadro? Yes. - What luck! Don't touch my feet. My feet is dirty. It's not hygienic. Do I give a Rohu fish? 2.5 kg? It's local. No. What do I do with such a large quantity? How about 1 kg? How much is it for? What price do I tell you? You have come to my shop. The fish market has become aromatic just like a temple. Give whatever you feel is right. Madhob, you have put me in trouble. Sir. Look here. How are you, Ali? Your blessings, sir. I have left fresh Talapia for you. Take them. I just took them from Madhob. Sir, it's special. I have separately kept them for you. Why are you refusing? You don't need to pay for these. Why so? Why are you selling the fish for free? Today, you can't reject Ali. Yesterday, he had a baby girl. Ali, I will bless your daughter. May God bless her. Please don't refuse, sir. I had told you last year, my wife keeps having a miscarriage. Sir, you had blessed and said, that next year you will become a father and it has come true! Sir, your words were as sweet as the Azan. Sir, please don't refuse. This is your madness. Madness. Son-in-law is arriving. Couldn't you bring Hilsa fish today? It's too expensive. People are always eager to offer you things. He won't have a problem eating other fishes either. Everyone respects you a lot. I don't know if they respect me, but yes they recognise me. I couldn't do anything in plays. At least with the help of Mr Pankaj, I could enter in Bengali radio. So, should I milk the recognition? No. I am not telling you to take benefits of your fame. But with your request, our son can get a good job. Rudro is bright. He is young. He can work hard. Why would he need his dad's recommendation? No, not recommendation. Menu said there's a greater opportunity at Akashvani. Give me a cup of tea. Don't forget. Let our son walk. Don't destroy his spine by handing him crutches. If you say it once... Listen. People do appreciate my talent. But respect has to be earned, not asked for. Such a big family. They play your recording every year. Then why don't they pay you every year? What's wrong with you this morning? Oh... You have lost it as I didn't get the Telapias at a cheaper rate. Get some tea quickly. I have thought of an amazing plot for a play. I will get to work once I get the tea. As if I care about your play. - Come on. - Yes. I have to bear all the nonsense. Irritating! Okay. - May I come in, sir? Come in. Thank you. Good morning, sir. Is something wrong? Good morning. No, nothing. What will be wrong during an emergency. There is one goal, progress. Have a seat. Thank you, sir. Mr Banerjee, when are you visiting Kolkatta? - I just returned. Sir, we have planned everything for the puja. We have informed the station master too. Right. There's a special programme during the puja at Kolkatta. Early morning. Are you referring to Mahisashur Mardini? Yes, sir. On the morning of Mahalaya. It's the most popular program, right? Yes, sir. That's not a problem. The same record is played. I know. The music of Mr Pankaj. Not only Mr Pankaj, sir. Star voices of Bengal. All the famous stars. All great artists. Whom do we leave out is tough decision. Who is the person who recites the chants? Bhadro. Birendra Krishna Bhadro. He is the essence. Innovation scares you all. How many days will you cash on your nostalgia? No, sir... That... His voice... People have no other options. But, I mean... Learn marketing, Mr Banerjee. Times are changing. If you are not willing to change, you are not willing to live. But sir, his voice is epic. Epic? Old. It's gold, sir. Learn to deal with diamonds, Mr Banerjee. No, I mean... This is your problem. No matter what you say, Bengalis begin with a 'no'. No, sir, I... There you go again! Learn to say 'yes'! Yes, I mean... Again... I got your point, sir. Listen, we have the instructions to revamp this most popular program. This has to be changed. This has to be composed afresh. Bring new singers, new music and most importantly new voice. New voice? Yes. The age of Bhadro has passed. Bring a new star. People recognise stars. Fan will automatically follow. Star? A replacement for Mr Biren? Sir, he is a... He cannot be replaced. You make me laugh. Nothing is permanent. This nation is running without Nehru and Gandhi. You should know how to replace. Quality is important but it's not everything. Sit down. You need a bigger brand than Bhadro. Better voice. Better voice? Satyajeet had declared that there is just one hero in Bengal. Bring him in and see, success will be at your feet. Uttam Kumar? Will he agree? It's Uttam Kumar not Kishore Kumar. This Mahalaya, Bengali's will either listen to Uttam Kumar or they won't. Okay, sir. I will try. Try? What a stupid word is this, Mr Banerjee? This is emergency. Time to bring in the new. Time for ordinary is over. It is the time for extra-ordinary. It's time for Uttam Kumar. Move, let us pass. Surprising! Move! Come here. Move. Come here, Mr Uttam. Enough. No one else will enter. No one will enter. Close the gates. Come. Please have a seat. I did call up. We had met at the blood donation camp. I am tempted to share a gossip. Please don't mind. I can't control it anymore. Don't withhold the gossip, Mr Khokon. It might create a problem in blood circulation. Well said. Yes, what I wanted to say, that having you do the veneration is like rearing an Elephant. Understood? That means crowd management, arranging for the cops. And then the lightnings which is a must. He is right. To be honest with you, I am also a bit scared on the occasion of Durga veneration. One can fake it in front of the camera. There is no other option but to surrender if caught by Mr Pramod. Well said. The news reporters are saying that after Sanyasi Raja, you have become Midas. Yes, Midas. True. Listen to what else they say. According to me, you should go and dip your feet again in the Mumbai water. I mean, from glamors point of view. Oh God! Stop it for sometime. I have arranged for sweet lime juice. Do you want some? Tea. Without milk and one spoon sugar. Very Good. Bolta! Bolta. - Yes, sir. Come here quickly. 2 cup tea. Without milk. Add a spoon sugar for Mr Uttam and nothing for me. And remember to get it in the new cutlery. Okay. Mr Uttam, when I take you to the lamp... How many years have completed? What? - The veneration. It's the 55th year. It's done at this scale since 1962. Give. Since then, I am the councilor. Wow! The tea tastes good. Darjeeling. It's the favourite of Gavaskar. General Ford can't do without this leaf. So BST has already facilitated you? It's the usual. Neither the level of Gavaskar's century nor America's president. Mr Uttam, I'll tell you something. The spectrum of acting in Sanyasi Raja cannot be seen in any of the Indian movies. Not just Indian movies, but Asian movies too. I am not exaggerating... - When does the veneration begin? What? When is the veneration? Okay. My best wishes and thank you to everyone present here. I express my best wishes to Kali Ghat health committee, as they have not just maintained the veneration tradition but they have also preserved the authentic atmosphere of it. And those you have come here, and have been waiting for so long, my best wishes to all you. Sing a song... One song... Recite a few lines for them, they will be happy. 'The one who have come here for my victory ceremony.' 'Believe me.' 'I have come here to become a king.' Sing a song, please. One song, please. Please. Listen. I am extremely touched by your love. But I have never done the narration. It was done my Mr Hemonto. I was just lip-singing. Just once. Please. Listen. You will make a century if you go to the pitch with a bat. I too love my elder brother's voice. But hearing you sing is completely different. Please sing a song. Please... Okay. I will try. Forgive me, in case I make any mistake. Arrange the sofa properly. Anyone there? Big brother! - Where is Uttam? He must be here... - Okay, I will look for him. Here. What is the matter? Everyone is looking for you downstairs. And you are standing on a corner of the terrace. Open air on the terrace helps in digestion. If I don't burn off the calories of the sweets and snacks, I won't be able to concentrate on the ground at night. True. So is it the breeze or the smoke? When I reached the terrace, I noticed that I just got the cigarette and forgot the match box downstairs. Good. I too forgot the cigarette but I got the match box. Lite it. - Wow! Good that I found you alone here. There is a proposal. Is anyone from Mumbai looking for me? No. I'm not here for that. Actually, apart from match stick, cigarette, song, and movies, we have got an opportunity to compliment each other. Stage show? Radio. Radio? I can understand if it's for you. But what will I do there? My face isn't worth showing there. I am useless there. You are an iceberg of talent. Your face and your smile is just the tip of that iceberg. What is the issue? I'll tell you. Do you remember Mr Banerjee from Delhi Akashvani? Mr Banerjee, yes that thin man? Yes, he had asked me for an interview. Correct. He had come to me last week. He gave me the proposal. They are planning to record the Mahalaya in a new way for next year. With new artists, new musicians, and a new voice. The content of Mahisashur Mardini will change? How's it possible? - Why? Why are you surprised? This is natural. Is it not surprising? Why didn't it change for so many years? No, I mean, Mr Pankaj's music, Mr Biren's voice. I can't think of Mahalaya without it. I mean... They should be there with the new artist. Everything is changing. Everything. Akashvani is trying to do something new and more bigger. That is why they are planning well in advance. Means... Mahalaya without Mr Biren's voice? Maybe they have found a more suitable voice, so they took this decision. A voice more impressive than Mr Biren! What are you saying? You mean that another impressive voice have been found for narration. Who is he? It's you. Me? Have you lost it, brother? I will replace Mr Biren? Why not? Had Aurindum Mukherjee ever thought that instead of performing Mr Ketan, doing Othelo he will become famous overnight? That's a movie story. Larger than life. Uttam, you are larger than life. Brother, I have never done something like this. Listen, Uttam. If I wasn't confident on you, would I've told you about it? You tell me, how many people have a voice like you? Who have such grasping capacity in the whole country? Still, brother, I... I will give the music and you will recite the chants. The best artists of the country will sing the song. Still, I don't understand. Everything will change? Yes. Change in a better direction. Both of you are on the terrace and everyone is looking for you. And the stage is set. Today, Mr Uttam has to sing. Think about it, Uttam. Great singers are sitting down, yet everyone is waiting for Uttam Kumar to come and sing a few lines. Brother, that is love. So I will replace Mr Biren and do the narration? Just a minute. Replacing Mr Biren? What is the matter? Amol. - Yes. You work for the media. I mean, you understand people of the country. You tell us... Will the public accept, if Uttam replaces Mr Biren's narration in Mahalaya? Mr Uttam, you are worried about this? Do you have an idea of the popularity Mahalaya could give? Religion has more power than movies even today. This is why, Mr Biren's voice has been playing for more than 40 years. And if you do it, then it will last for more than 400 years. You are thinking of rejecting such a golden opportunity? No. This is a serious matter. Brother, when Mr Biren recites the chants I feel as if I'm in a temple. Yes. We have to rehears very hard to reach up to his level. Where do I have the time? I have my shoots pending. Your name will take this program as high as the sky. More than that, the texture and timber of your voice. It's my word. It's bound to be a big hit. Are you sure? Yes. Mr Pankaj had said, that If I work in Mumbai, I won't be able to give time to Mahisashur Mardini. That is why I didn't get a chance to sing. But I was unable to assure him that if one has the determination, they could practice staying in Mumbai too. I have that determination, Uttam. I will surely do it. Lata, Asha and Manna will sing. I will sing. Mahalaya's program will bring the light of new beginning. It's just that you have to be there. 'Smoke seems to be rising from the chimney.' 'I am unable to breath in this stinking atmosphere.' Who is it? Is it Anil? Why did you stop, Mr Biren? It was nice. The ethereal play. Yes, Chanakya's character is not less ethereal. Listen, Sudendu. You will come and stand here. And you. You will go and stand in his place. And you. Where did you go? You will stand here. Will you remember? Yes. You all continue I will be back. Continue. It's a luck to see you perform on the stage. How long have you been standing here? About 15 minutes. Come, sit. Are you continuing to do playback? Yes, in Kalibhadra. More due to radio. I have a few recordings today. Had time so I thought of coming to meet you once. Good. Will you have tea? The taste of tea is different on rehearsals. Poncha, 2 cups of tea here. Mr Biren, if you don't mind I want to know something. About what? I have not investigated if it's true or false. I've heard... What? I met Mr Banerjee. From the Akashvani? - Yes. I heard that from next year, the program of Mahisashur Mardini will be stopped. Yes. What? Did no one from Akashvani inform you? One has to keep such things under wrap. Maybe that is why I didn't get the news. A new program will be done? I didn't get the details. But I heard... Tell me without hesitation. There is no use hiding any news. I heard they will do a fresh recording again. With new music too. A new voice is being looked for the narration. Younger voice. Anil, new artists have to come. Who else will save the old half dead people like us? This is so obvious. Mr Biren. You remind me of 'Sanatana Goswami', by Rabindranath. 'The wealth that made me wealthy,' 'I do not know if it's the master.' 'But I still bow my head in front of it, like a slave.' Can anyone be a legend like you, Mr Biren? There is no desire left. Old fools will talk all kinds of nonsense. So who will do the narration? That's the biggest surprise. I'm not sure about it. Will Mr Pankaj compose new music or just new recordings? A new music is being composed. Someone else in place of Mr Pankaj. They are replacing Mr Pankaj? Bengali and the Bengalis has truly progressed. Even if Rabindranath didn't want to change Mr Pankaj's music, the new age Bengali wants it. This is modernism. Have the tea, it's turning cold. Mr Pankaj, something important has come up. More important than recording too? Wait. I will be back. Yes. Let me introduce first. I hope Mr Pankaj knows Mr Bani. And he is Mr Aghorsamantho. The chief of Sanatan Hindu Parishad. The people who have accompanied him... Identity of the leader is the identity his team. So that the importance of time is valued. Why are you standing, Mr Aghor? Have a seat. He is here to talk to you about Mahisashur Mardini. I'll tell you about it. I don't beat around the bush and talk to the point. In political circuit, I am unpopular for my undiplomatic ways. Being unpopular is an important weapon to create a brand. Just like I am unpopular in the music industry. As Shotayshathong. Shothay...? - Shathong. Extremely sour. Let me come to the point. Your Mahalaya is loved by the masses for the rightful reasons. You all are talented people. There's nothing surprising if you all do such cultural programs for our religion. I hope you don't mind if I smoke. No. - Carry on. But in this auspicious celebration, the society has an objection for the presence of the unacceptable elements. Objection? There's nothing wrong in Mahisashur Mardini... Mr Bani, you all belong to the higher class of the society. Is it sufficient to converse with the clouds? Do you have any news about the Hindus and what condition they live in Kolkatta? Their plight, their likings, and their needs. Do you have any news about it? If you are here to teach about social-religion issues then let me inform you that as recording is getting delayed at least 7 Muslims, 2 Sikhs and 22 Hindus whom you are representing as their leader. Their valuable time is being wasted. Lack of patience is very common amongst talented people, Mr Pankaj. Considering your immense talent and respecting it. I don't mind your rude behaviour. Mr Aghor, bullying is very common in politics. I worship music. Don't expect political devotion from me. You have 5 minutes. Say whatever you have to. Mr Aghro, lets hear about your problem. Aghor is capable of resolving his problems. I need not come to you for it. I just came here to say that the non-Brahmans need to stop reciting the chants on Mahalaya morning. The next Mahalaya will happen excluding Mr Biren Bhadro. A non-Brahman reciting the chants is an insult of the Goddess and to Hinduism. None of you have the right to play with the honor of religion. Actually Mr Aghor wants to say that having a non-Brahman like Mr Biren recite the chants is an destroying the essence of the Goddess worship. There are protests at many places against it. Stop playing football with religion. The Hindu religion of Bengal is nurtured by the knowledge of Swami Vivekananda. This humiliation won't be tolerated anymore. But Mr Aghor. Swamiji himself advised to hurt religion with football. I don't have time for nonsense talks. I informed what needs to be done. Where are we able to do what we are supposed to. Where am I able to kick out the right person at the right time? "Enlightenment is beneath the Goddess' feet." "Have a look if it's enlightenment." I belong to the Shakto clan. Ages ago we sacrificed humans. I wouldn't have entered politics if I feared humiliation. I am telling you decently to remove Mr Biren. Shakto... Shakto... I heard, goat meat helps in making the brain sharper. No. You are less Shakto. You have a little brain. The song you just sang. Do you know who sang it? It's not by a Brahman. It's not by a Kayasth either. He is the son of a Muslim. A muslim! If few more such men were born, the condition of our country would have changed. He must have been wrong to write such a heart touching Shyama sangeet(song). If not, the song that brings tears to one's eyes, why will a goon sing it for bullying? Mind your tongue, Mr Pankaj. Mr Pankaj wants to say that Mr Biren's voice is the essence of Mahishasur Mardini. Whom are you trying to explain? He is a person who does political business with religion. Mr Mallik. Mr Aghor, not even Rabindranath pointed his finger at me. And never has a non singer dared to sing Shyama sangeet before me. Doing Mahisashur Mardini without Mr Birendra is like immersing the statue into a well. Mahalaya will be acceptable without me but Mahalaya is impossible without Mr Biren. It's outcome won't be good, Mr Pankaj. Mr Biren has to be kept away from the next Mahalaya. Let everyone know. You get this clear, too. If you want to keep Biren out of Mahalaya, so will I stay out of it. The recording time is getting wasted. Let's go, Mr Bani. - Let's go. Did you see his courage? Forgive me. I am helpless. I don't know if Hindu religion will be hurt if Mr Biren recites the chants. But keeping Mr Pankaj away from Akashvani is something im... Please, don't enter. I am from the press. Try to understand. Sir, I am Ganguly. Let him in. I have come with a complain. Of course, you have come with a complain. If you all are contended, how will you all generate the new content? It's a serious issue. Do you see a smile on my face? Would you like some tea? Your people at the reception and security heckled me. I wanted to speak to Mr Pankaj. It's just the matter of 5 minutes. You could have just said that he is not here. You are asking the people from press to leave. I was shown the door in the most uncivilized manner. What is this, Mr Stevenson? What is what, Mr Ganguly? Does Akashvani no longer care for its PR? Is it a crime to meet the artists? Do you accept it? Not at all. Reception. I won't stand for this nonsense. If you can't do your duty well, I suggest you to quit your job right now. Okay. I have said repeatedly. No matter how powerful the media is, they are not allowed to talk to Mr Mallik. And if someone insists, kick them out. Throw them out immediately. Is this behaviour of yours right? Mahisashur Mardini is about to be closed. You are retiring Mr Pankaj and Mr Biren. How do you justify this, Mr Stevenson? That is essentially the problem with you media. You have a problem with Gables. But if Churchill, who killed more than a million Bengalis in an artificial famine that he created. If ever a film is made about it, you all will go buy the tickets standing in a queue. And then you will applaud him. That is why we need an emergency, Mr Ganguly. See. We are not trying to get rid of them. We are just bracing ourself for something bigger and better. What did you understand, Uttam? No. Elder brother can't do it. I can't get the tune right. It seems very artificial. The flow is missing. Why are you getting impatient? It's just the second day. The way I am trying to say it, the throw of the dialogue is being broken. It's not a dialogue, it's a Sotram. Yes, the same. I can't differentiate between them. Listen. Now you are getting over critical about yourself. Shyamol, Ajay, everyone was there during the rehearsal. Everyone was enchanted by your recital. No. They were not listening. They were just starring at me with their mouth open. Then do one thing. You listen to Mr Biren's voice a couple of times more. He has a natural curve in his delivery. Try to identify it. - I do understand, elder brother. I do. The way he modulated his voice, I won't be able to do it even if I practice it for a 1000 time. The way he lowered his voice in few of the verses. It will not come by practicing too. - I am playing it, listen to it once. Mr Banerjee, please come in. Good morning. - Good morning, please have a seat. Heard, you all are working very hard at the rehearsal. My colleague Shotodol was humming your tune at office. Heard Mr Uttam too has got the hang of things. Did you get it, Uttam? Then your nervousness is completely unnecessary. Excuse me. Nervous? Who is nervous? Mr Uttam is nervous? What are you saying, sir? Seeing him, the Bengali’s get collectively nervous. Mr Uttam is nervous. This is what is happening, Mr Banerjee. The shoes I am trying to step in... You are Uttam Kumar. Why do you need a shoe? You will neither walk nor run. You will be flying. The next line. Listen. - Yes, sir. You come by tomorrow evening. Before that, I will have the chorus practiced. Yes. But I have to go to Mumbai tomorrow. I got a trunk call this morning. It's okay if we don't do I recording. How much work is pending there. Staying in Kolkatta for a long time... Work of 3 movies are going on simultaneously. There's a tradition of Mahisashur Mardini. That is not like other recording. No one else knows it better than you. It will take about 3 months. I agree. But... Mr Pankaj, I have a professional commitment in Mumbai too. The directors and the producers depend on me. You don't worry. I will definitely rehearse in Mumbai too. There will be no lack in my commitment. Yes, I know that. But, we are not discussing either about you or me. Then, leaving so many jobs in Mumbai... You are our pride. When you work in Mumbai, then I am the most proud of you. But. Breaking the rules of the rehearsal means ones own self. No. It's not possible for you to sing in Mahisashur Mardini being in Mumbai. I can have Lata or Asha sing it. You all are my children. How can I be partial? Hello! - Good Morning, Mr Stevenson. Good Morning, Banerjee. I smell good news in your voice. Don't underestimate me. I am the Bradman of all news. Mr Uttam Kumar has agreed. Well I don't think he had much of an option. Did he? But listen. Tell me somethng. I know that Uttam is good. But... Bradman, really? If I think crazily. Then the popularity of Uttam Kumar is more in Bengal than Bradman in Australia. I hope he does a good show. Sir. Do you know something, if Bengali's choose someone as their icon, no one can stop him. If Uttam Kumar acts in third grade movies, it still brings amazing business. What? Propagate that Mr Uttam Kumar has agreed to do Mahalaya and then see. 5 bells will ring before half time. Anyway, good bye, Banerjee. Dad, I came to tell you... Got the news in the morning... Uncle has passed away. No. The dialogues are a little unclear. It's fine you are keeping in mind the mannerism. But voice. But the voice needs to be a bit loud. Specially where you are finally delivering the news of the demise. I am tolerating it since yesterday. There's a limit to every thing. What is the matter, Shubhino? Grandfather. I am continuously here at Akashvani since yesterday. A rehearsal of one day took 2 days because of you. You have a problem in every problem. I am continuously doing the film acting. I never had to listen to anything there. You have been nagging continuously since yesterday. Film acting and theater are not the same. Also theater and radio play are not the same. There's a difference in acting on every platform. Here you go again with your lecture. Acting is different on every platform... Grandfather, stop this nonsense of yours. Time has changed, acting has also changed. Do you have any news about the experiments done by the Japanese on dialogue throwing techniques? How can a play be more life like... You all are still stuck on to your age old techniques. In everything you all are still backward. Raise your voice. This kind of acting happened 40 years ago. When you first recorded for Mahisashur Mardini then. That was the age of melodramatic delivery. I think, today you won't be able to concentrate in the rehearsal. Okay, you may leave. Tomorrow... Grandfather. You time is over. You only had the Mahisashur Mardini. I heard even that is about to stop. Mr Uttam is doing the narration. Get to know how modern delivery is done hearing his narration. And listen, stop your lecture now. As an adult I too have a limit of tolerating all this. I can't waste my time coming for your rehearsals. I will directly come on the day of the recording that is on the following Saturday. Shobhimol. Uncle Anil, when did you arrive? What's more important is that I came at the right time. Listen. You don't have to come on Saturday as well. Uncle Anil, I was telling him that... Don't spoil your mood, Anil. Shobhimol is young, he has put forth his views. In spite of being a senior, at times you need to slap the young, Mr Biren. Sorry, uncle Anil. I lost it while reading... You may leave now! Mr Biren, I will come tomorrow. You don't have to come tomorrow as well. Ensure that I don't see you anywhere near this studio. Anil, listen. Please, Mr Biren. In spite of being a producer, I am begging you for this right. All of you, go out. You could have stayed calm. It's true that time has changed. It's true that time has changed. And standing here in this moment, I remember a performance recited by you. I'm glad you reminded me. 'The court was adjourned.' 'Now, new people have arrived.' 'Showing their new colours.' Wow! Listening to your voice, it seems as if it has started raining. Do you recall the last line? 'The rich people of the world' 'have braced each other.' 'Were there is no love.' 'A court of the mum.' 'There songs won't be sung.' Mr Biren. What happened? - Haven't you heard? What happened? - We have to leave immediately. Let us check if Mr Bani and Mr Pankaj know about it. Then what? Listen, I am taking the record. You take the pen and the book. We have to directly go to Neemtola. From Jodashako, I think they will reach by... What are you saying? Mr Bani. Yes. Are you leaving? Yes. As per the condition from the news I received, broadcasting might not be possible. Apart from Delhi and foreign radios, I don't think the government will allow anyone else to cross the barricade. Mr Bani, should I not try one last time? Do it. You can select the equipment yourself. No use increasing the number of people. Mr Pankaj? When Rabindranath Tagore bid us good bye without hearing to voice of the Bengalis, his death will be a lie. You were Rabindranath's last selected flower bud from his garden. 'If you permit, I wished to use' 'one of your song in my movie.' 'And...' 'Speak without any fear.' 'If you permit and give your blessings' 'I want to sing the song, At the end of the day.' 'Yes.' 'Why does a film star need my poetry?' 'I have rejected Mr Bijen and Mr Ghosai.' 'Do you know?' 'Whatever.' 'I don't have many instruments in this room.' 'Today, you sing without' 'the instruments.' '7th August 1941, Nobel Laureate Rabindranath Tagore passed away.' 'It's the most tragic moment.' 'Quietly, he let's his foot down.' ''Unknown like the directions.' 'Ignored everyone's hope.' 'Morning has shut its eyes today.' 'The breeze wants to call too.' 'The blue sky too wants to cover.' 'Even the clouds drop their tears.' 'No one to hear your call.' 'His door are now closed.' 'You are a lonely traveler.' 'In the lonely route ahead.' 'He is the lone friend.' 'Who is his love?' 'Leaves behind the vacant house.' 'Leaving us lonely behind.' 'Don't go away, leaving us alone.' You see, Mr Stevenson, Kolkatta is becoming warmer. Yes, sir. The way the population is exploding and apart from that, there's the refugee problem. You are absolutely right, Mr Banerjee. The country is getting crowed by poor people. These people should be caught and forced to undergo vasectomy. They will get married and give birth to children. But they will not work. They are liability on economy. How will the nation grow? Give it. - Yes, sir. Food supply crisis, crisis in health service. Such that the temperature in Kolkatta risen as well. Is running a government and a poultry farm the same? India is fortunate that government has put its foot down. Be it economy or culture. Nonsense will not be tolerated. Would you like to have lunch, sir? No, I need to go to the writers to meet the honorable Chief Minister. Special instructions. Just tea. What happened about your puja? Sir, we have listed a new team. Bengals' most salable talent is on that list. Sir, it just can't get any better. And that's the reason I like you. You move things forward. Mr Uttam Kumar who you address as Royal prince. He is not a prince, sir. He is the king. King Kumar, sir. Sugar? - One. Banerjee, read the list. - Yes, sir. Narrated by Uttam Kumar, Basanto Choudhary, Chonda Sen, Partho Ghosh. Composed by V Balsara, Shyamol Gupto. Voices of Hemanto Mukherjee, Lata Mangeshkar, Asha Bhosle, Manna Dey. Shobna Mukherjee, Aarti Mukherjee, Manabendra Mukherjee. Bijen Mukherjee and Utpala Sen. Very good, these are the star singers of Kolkatta and Mumbai. Moreover Hemant Kumar, Uttam Kumar. This is cinema on air. Very good! Excellent! Sir, actually we have spoken to Uttam Kumar about the primary aspects. Now, we have to request him as soon as possible. Id Permission has arrived. Request? Mr Banerjee, a request can be refused too. From when did the celebrities start asking for request in India? No, I mean their schedule... - Wow! To drive away malaria mosquitoes, government is about to spray and you will tell that there's a schedule in your garden to spray. Sir, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity. We have made them an offer that they are not allowed to refuse. Really, this is the reason I like you. Understood everything, sir. Like the last time, if Mr Ganguly... You know well what did I do with Mr Ganguly. I have driven him away from Akashvani. I will put him in such a situation that no one will remember him after 20 to 25 years. If anyone refuses you, take my name. Tell them that the consequence won't be good. Should I threaten them? Threat? Why are you talking in a criminal language? Truth is not threat. And conveying the truth is the job of God. And who is God, Mr Banerjee? The Government, sir. Sir, we have a new name. Yes, sir. Mr Mukherjee has suggested Mother who rescues from disaster. Beautiful! Devotional feel is generated from within. Wow! Very good. I have to do some action scenes. The place is not too far. Won't be a problem. Where is the location? It's at one hour distance from Sundarban. Where is the place? The coordinator knows about it. Elder brother, please come. - How are you, elder brother? I am going to Mumbai tomorrow. So I thought of finishing your meal today. No problem if you finish my meal, but don't finish me. Please give me a minute. Elder brother. I am unable to do it at a couple of places. - Can't do it? What are you saying? The station director himself is praising your rehearsal recording and are saying... - Wow! Has the foreigner adopted Hindu religion? He must be a foreigner, but he has an interest in Ved and Upanishad. And you know what? He understands the religion of music better than us. Brother, handling the public is something different. Here, our wife, kids, and relatives are too excited to hear the Mahalaya. If anything goes wrong, I will be kicked out of the house. And if my wife says, it's not even close to Mr Biren's recitation, it wasn't done well, that will be a much bigger disaster than a flop film. I thought of going to your house for some practice and you are going to Mumbai. Yes. Didn’t I tell you about it? I had briefed somewhat to Lata and Asha on phone. But I have to finalize the rest reaching there. But there's no more time, elder brother. Your recording will begin in a few days. Uttam. The recording techniques have changed all across the world. I agree, that during the thirties, it was a difficult task to do the recording having everyone gathered together. But now the situation is different. You tell me. In today's time, will you get time to rehearse for 3 months? I couldn't explain this simple thing to Mr Pankaj. I definitely want Lata and Asha in this program. I can see that you are leaving no stone unturned. In Indian history, this Mahalaya will be written in red letter. So anything marginally left is not acceptable. Mr Biren, are you busy? Anil, come, have a seat. I was thinking about you. I need a new voice. Mr Bimal's voice betrayed us at the wrong time. Chandragupto? Mr Bimal have put us in a tricky position. The time we have in hand, we can always train someone else. But I was thinking... What happened, Anil? Why do you look so depressed? I am not feeling good, Mr Biren. A bond for so long... So what? Every year, the same routine was repeated. Something new will happen this time. Even Durga Puja has been happening for so many hundreds of years. Has a test match been organized instead of Durga Puja? This is about your sentiments. It's not about a test match instead of Puja. It's new music, new voice. Humans have previously made a mistake shying away from change. When change comes naturally, it is acceptable. Similarly, if it is forced upon, it's not tolerable, Mr Biren. Anil. I am still standing tall as you all had embraced me tight. Forget it. Arrange for a replacement. The play can't happen like this. - Yes. Mr Biren, there were a couple of important calls for you before you arrived. Not getting you on phone, he left an important message for you. Who called? VVIP telephone. So I thought of giving you the information myself. What is VVIP? Mr Uttam Kumar had called. Mr Uttam Kumar? - Yes. The Uttam Kumar from the movie 'Poth Jodi Na Shesh Hoye'! If you permit, he wants to meet you at your home. He also asked me to tell you that if you are busy... - No, I am not busy. Okay, if he wants to come, he can. Okay, sir. Sir, I'll take your leave now. - Okay. Come, let's go, Anil. Is Mr Biren at home? Who are you, my child? I am... It is you who I saw on opening the door. So, it's obvious I'm asking you. No, I am... Do you have a name? What do I tell sir, who is here? Tell him Uttam has come. I understood that it's Uttam. But are you from the puja committee or from the radio? Alon's mom, who has come? That is what I'm asking him, sir. - Yes, child? Have you come from the radio or from the puja committee? Mr Uttam you? Alon's mom, what are you doing? Let him come inside. Come in. Please come. Don't worry. Just imagine. Alon's mom doesn't step out of the kitchen. She asks you... - Mr Biren. I didn't feel bad when compared to the people who run behind me. 'Who are you?' Have not heard it for a long time. Come. Is your health fine? - Yes, I am good. I came during your working hours. Please forgive me. What are you saying? I'm fortunate that you... Sit here. Let me do it. It's okay. You have a seat. - Sure. Do you return late, every night? Not every day. When there's a new play, we need to practice for few days. Let me call for some tea. No, I have already had tea. Mr Biren... Tell me, what is wrong? Why do you look so tensed, Uttam? Not tensed. - Then? Actually, Mr Biren, about the morning program. The morning Mahalaya. I didn't want to do it. Believe me. I mean, everyone together pressurized me that... - Your beautiful voice. It's a God's gift. I have heard from anyone that you have ever missed a voice pitch. No, I am not worried about the performance, Mr Biren. When I first got the opportunity of acting, I used to think if I'm acting well, if I am expressing well. I never had any worries about myself. I was my own trump card, so... I never had to put myself in anyone else's shoe. You are your own trump card even today. All the members of my family are your ardent fans. Do you believe that a celebrity can justify this program? Listen Uttam, I believe in truth. And I believe in your truth. Mr Biren. You have established the throne of the God in the temple. I am scared. If laying a carpet in that temple and putting in a sofa there, I don't turn it into a living room. Uttam, nothing remains the same forever. That wouldn't be right either. Even the throne of God disbalances when they reach eternity. We are just tiny specks in the cosmos. We do have a temple, but it's in our minds. It was never in the studio. Look, I was engrossed in writing a new play. Here... This book is my God, now. Have a look. Sorry, please don't mind... I addressed you by your name. I am not letting go of this claim of addressing me by my name easily. Please bless me. Don't do this. Dad, we are leaving. First, we will be going to the new market and then to Goria haat. We will have our meal out. And your meal is already prepared. It's too crowded. Go carefully, dear. Is it too important to visit both the places? Yes. It's extremely important. How many days are left for the puja? In fact, why are you not accompanying us? Come along. You are engaged in the plays throughout the day. I don't understand anything about puja shopping. Will you benefit taking me along? Dad, you are becoming gloomy unnecessarily. I'm noticing for the past few days you're quiet. You don't even reply. Nothing like that, silly girl. Why? She is right. No, nothing of that sort. The play is occupying my thoughts. Is it so easy to change the actor in the last minute? Dad... Two men have come from some club. They want to meet you. Ask them to come. - Okay. - Listen. Have your meal on time. We will be late. Will this get entangled? Listen. Okay, fine. We have to see where he discontinues. From when is the group rehearsal starting? You practice your part. It's my duty to set it. I was saying that as we are short of time, wouldn't it be good if we started the group rehearsal? Not needed. Not needed? Let me think about the aspects of music. Okay. I mean, you will directly start recording... I was saying as Mahalaya is an early morning program... Mr Banerjee. They will not directly record coming to Kolkata. I have already spoken to them. I had personally been to Mumbai and trained them for the song. They have started practicing accordingly. I will have their recording done at Mumbai itself. Recording at Mumbai? The rehearsal is happening here, the artists are all here? Won’t there be a problem in orchestration? Problem? Why will I do something that will lead to a problem, Mr Banerjee? I... - And why did you assume that I will work as per your method? Actually, Mr Pankaj always insisted on having group rehearsal. Will you be able to print the newspaper using the Gutenberg printing machine? Cricket has changed, cinema has changed, music has changed, playback has changed. But you all... You still believe that Mahishasur Mardini is a bible. I agree. Mr Pankaj is greatly respected by us all. But the time is changing. No, I didn't mean to say that. - I... Mr Banerjee, I am not Mr Pankaj Mallik. And Mr Pankaj Mallik is not me. This is my program, not Mr Pankaj's. So this program will happen in my style not in the old style. Do you understand? You may leave now. Dad, tea. Tea. What are you thinking about? I am not feeling too well. Rest a bit now. The whole day... Will rest when the time is right. End of the day, time for sleep. Why are you thinking so much, dad? No. Why will I think, dear? What thoughts can disturb me? The day has come to an end. Do you want to go to the balcony? Do you want to go to the balcony? Fresh air? Instead, bring fresh air to me. Get my harmonium. What happened, Mr Dutto? Mr Uttam is ready. It will be done once the puja is completed. I understood everything, but what about the time? Priest... - Coming. It's being completed here. As soon as the offerings are distributed, have just one hand. Kanai. Help the priest quickly. Hurry up. You are unfortunate, Mr Arun has arrived. Sorry sir, you had to wait for a long time. Where is it late? Just waiting for a couple of cigarettes. We are all ready. The puja is also been done. Priest, please give him the offerings. Mr Uttam, I am your greatest fan. Not just me. Priest, only God can bear the burden of such devotion. I am a human made of dirt. Give it to the others. Go. He takes a definite step in fear of indefinite. He is Uttam who always stays grounded. Correct. So, Mr Uttam Kumar, have the butterflies created havoc in your tummy? I don't know if it's for taking the cigarettes from you or because of the priest's offering, but I am full of inspiration. I heard when W. G. Grace came down to the pitch, no one could take his wicket, as long as he did not wish for. Remember. Uttam kumar is no less than Grace in cricket for the Bengalis. Your standing in front of the microphone is a revolution. What? - Absolutely right. I am standing out. Are you sure? - Of course. To immerse in your voice, Bengalis are awaiting for you in excitement. 'Durga Durgotiharini.' 'The auspicious occasion of invoking the Goddess...' Sir. Well gentlemen, what do you think? I don't know who says what. But I must tell you, I feel like kicking myself. Why, sir? Why didn't I think about this change for so long? Brillian! Uttam's voice. We kept playing that old voice for so long. What a voice! What music! What coordination! Uttam, Asha, Lata, Manna De. Wow! Brilliant! The members of cultural committee, you all too say something. Did you like it or not? It's very good. Super hit! It's Uttam Kumar's poem. It isn't a poem, it's a sacred chant. Yes, it's the same. Whatever it is, it's amazing. Had tears in my eyes and had goosebumps too. You have no choice but to accept it. This program will keep the listeners glued to it. People will like it. But... But? This is the problem of the Bengali intellects. No I mean, actually... No means, actually what? Did you all like it or no? It's different if you didn't like it. And if you did, there's no place for any doubt. I mean, there was a traditional appeal in Mr Biren's voice. There you go. If something new is done, you can't accept it. You liked it, but you still have a doubt. Did you like it or no? Did you like it or no? Do you have anything else to say? No, what else do I say? Full marks. What? I meant 100 out of 100. Okay. Okay, this program is a super hit. I will inform the boss. Thank you, sir. We have not informed Mr Biren and Pankaj anything officially. Why will you inform them? They've served us for long enough. Let them rest in peace. This is the voice of new generation. What do you think? Cultural officers? - Right. I didn't hear you. Yes. You are right. Right. Dad... I think I will be given a long holiday during the puja. From the first day of Mahalaya. Do we go for an outing to some hill station? This is good news. I have never seen you wanting to go for a trip. Better late than never. - Yes dad, we will have a blast. We will board the Darjeeling express in the morning. We will go out during the Puja? - Why? What work do you have here then? No. I mean... You know well that I have made many commitments during the puja. Okay. The programs? We can cancel them this year. There's no harm if I cancel them. Nothing is irreplaceable. Don't say no dad. I'm planning to book the tickets this morning. Okay. Then... - What then? You can't say that you're busy. Exactly. One shouldn't take away one's desire. I will not take a bath on the morning of Mahalaya? Will I not offer prayers? I won't chant looking at the sky? If Akashvani has removed me, should I try to avoid the sky? Madam, I won't get milk tomorrow. Why? It's Mahalaya tomorrow. It's also Bukun's birthday. I will have to prepare dessert early morning. Can't help it. There's Mahalaya's program on the radio. Being a fan of Rajesh Khanna, why are you so excited about Mahalaya? It's not an ordinary Mahalaya. Mr Uttam Kumar will recite it. You had heard the Mahalaya by Birendra Krishna Bhadro. This year, you will hear it by Mr Uttam Kumar. Let's see how does Mr Uttam Kumar recite the Mahalaya this year. Apo, set the alarm properly. It's Mahalaya by Mr Uttam Kumar tomorrow. We have to wake up early. If we are unable to get up on time? What are you saying? What if we miss the Mahalaya by Mr Uttam Kumar? I wake up at 4 every morning. I will wake you up. Mom, where is dad? The same place where he is found on this day, every year. Performing his puja. - Even today? Son, is it not Mahalaya today? I mean, today is... Mahalaya was not for Akashvani. What are you doing waking up so early morning? I woke up. Now if mom can make a cup of tea... I will get it. Do you remember grandma Putul? Your aunt? She always pinched my cheeks. Putul aunt's husband, my uncle. Went on tours for theater. Amazing thing was he acted in it but never saw the play himself. He never saw Jatra? - No. He said I am a theater actor. All my dealings are on the stage. If I sit in the audience, my view will change. The intensity of acting will decrease. He was a strange person. If I get the experience of the other side of the stage, the actor within me will shrink. This was the difference. But I am experiencing a thrill. Mahalaya means standing on the stage, relying on my voice. This belief has bounded me tight. But there is an option to go behind the stage. This was important. Dad, I had told you, we could have gone on a trip for few days. Don't mistake my words to be my lamentation. One has to learn to open the fist. Your dad has the courage to open the fist. Switch on the radio. 'Durga Durgotiharini.' 'The auspicious occasion of invoking the Goddess!' 'Her auspicious arrival. Her mesmerizing beauty.' 'With her arrival, it feels like heavenly abode.' 'She gets enlightened by the mother earth.' 'With her sweet voice...' Dad. Dad, wake up. Dad! Dad, wake up. Akashvani, Kolkata. 'I here by present the local news.' Sister-in-law, wait and see. After the voice of Uttam, we don't feel like listening to the the voices of these news reporters. Let's switch off the radio. Okay. We never thought that your voice texture will be so soothing to hear. Going forward, you will get many assignments of National level. Good that you all were with me since morning. If not, I would have had to sit alone listening to my voice. Breakfast is ready. It will be good if you can come to the dining table. Yes. It won't be good to compromise with the crispy Puris. Go, get up. Hello! Yes, elder brother, giving him. Elder brother has called. The program is a super hit. Tell me. 'All the alarm clocks of Kolkata city have done overtime.' The alarm is ringing near people's ears and in my tummy. 'I heard, there's no discussion happening regarding Durga Puja.' 'Everyone is just praising you.' Yes. I am surprised too, elder brother. Numerous calls since morning congratulating me. The ones at home are also excited but... I have a different concern. What concern? Yes. This is not cinema, it's Mahalaya. This should've created an atmosphere of the arrival of the Goddess. When the radio played Mr Biren's voice, it seemed the puja has arrived. Let's take a leave for 2 days. Taking an off from shoot, let me go, sit in one corner of the tent. But today... 'Today?' Today, I just heard Uttam Kumar speak. The feeling of the puja didn't sink in. It was not meant to get spotlight. It was meant for the puja. The fragrance of puja, the mood of puja and the puja morning. 'You are being too harsh on yourself, Uttam.' 'Mr Biren and Mr Pankaj did create a legacy.' 'I agree.' 'But there is a change in the air. The employees of Akashvani' 'too were mesmerized by your voice.' 'Then why are you thinking so much?' Elder brother, humans will have love. But... Did the puja arrive? 'It was good?' 'It doesn't have the essence of puja.' 'Yes. - That's right.' 'Yes, the original is the best.' 'Yes.' Yes. Who is it? Mr Banerjee, come in. Sit. The phone... Kolkata and Bengal have turned the whole thing upside down. But you need to receive the call. Mr Shashi is trying you. Yes, but how do you answer for this mess? Please tell me. Didn't think it will be such a big mess. Why not? That was your job. No one could think that Uttam and his brother's pair won't be a hit. I think that the legacy of Mr Pankaj and Mr Biren... To heck with their legacy! Okay? How many days will it work depending on legacy and nostalgia? Are you telling this to me? I am talking about you all. Oh, you are talking about us all? - Yes. I am talking about you. It's your fault. You Bengalis, you and your coffee house. Progressive! When are you going to give it up? This legacy is much more deep than the radio. Bengalis puja is at a halt. - What?! Hold on. Assume during Christmas, your son sees Charlie Chaplin instead of Santa. Then your dear son will be sad. So, Charlie Chaplin is not at fault for this. This is ridiculous. Sir, I think we should meet Mr Pankaj. Why? He had a cardiac arrest on the day of Mahalaya. So I think we need to bring him back as the music director. Charlie Chaplin! If I wish to, I can change Santa Clause into whoever I want. I can beat him up and make him thin. I can shave off his hair and make him bald. Give him a Charlie Chaplin mustache, convert him into Charlie Chaplin. And if I so wish, no one can stop me. Sir...- This Mahishasur idea was one of the failure. That is all. Okay? We are going to continue in that direction if we have to. And this Sangeet, etc. It is dead to me as far as I am concerned. - Sir... You can go and visit Mr Pankaj if you want. I have no problem. But never bring up this program again or Mahishasur Mardini. Okay. - But sir... Now as far as I am concerned, it is your business to clear the mess on my table. Take these letters from here immediately. But sir, these... - Now, Mr Banerjee. Okay, sir. Gosh! Sir... - Shut up! Mr Sashi. - Shut up. Sir what I wanted to ask was that... Why don't you understand? You are an officer, why do you want to listen to Shut up? It wasn't my fault. The most prestigious project of Akashvani flopped miserably. And big boss is saying, it is not my fault. Sorry sir, we have done our homework. This is unprecedented, sir. That's all. Then who asked you to put up an act of stopping the Mahalaya? You! - What? You suggested, we replace Bhadro and Mallik. I just wanted to make it big and better. Do you know it has hit our boss's prestige? The ministers have completely lost face. Anyway, big boss wants to meet you. Oh, no! - Yes. There's a phrase in English. 'Manage your own crap'. Big boss will not even give you a tissue paper. I better leave now. Issue a public apology. And make it sound, it's your fault. Ministry had nothing to do with it. Incredible. - Listen. Do play the recording of Bhadro before puja. And it's boss's instruction. What? Yes. Sir. Do you hear Bengali songs? Yes, I do. Why? No. Last year, Mr Uttam Kumar had released a Bengali song. I think that was a hint for us. We were unable to understand it. The song is... 'To whose tune did I dance?' 'You are blaming me instead.' 'I see you, Mr Shashikanto' 'You turned a lie into dirt.' Dad, if you bullied us a bit more through the radio in our childhood, may be we would have feared a bit more. A big burden has been taken away from my chest. Puja has arrived. Mr Pankaj. Who is it? You always said, you will recognise my voice amongst thousands of people. Okay, it's you! You are in my heart. It's were I had a stroke. Shouldn't mind the faults of half dead people. I don't know. I had come here thinking that I will say many things. But... - But what? What is stopping you? I am still alive. I am completely exhausted. Too exhausted. Do you remember? You rectified my mistakes so effortlessly. Through out my life, I didn't do anything other than training. Will you be able to? Will you be able to forget all my mistakes? Why will you commit a mistake? I have not let you drift away. See, I still get lot of strength when I hold the hand of my student. But I had broken down while I tried something. What did you try? I tried to move away from under your shadow. I tried to prove that I am not junior Pankaj. I had told you, you are a legend. People of this country will address you as a legend even after a 100 years from today. Please, bless me. So that I don't fall anymore standing away from your shadow. Please bless me. Shadow! There's no other shadow greater than music. Not affection. Not love. No shelter. "Those who had to go to their home," "when did they leave for their home?"
