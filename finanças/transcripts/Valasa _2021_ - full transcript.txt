I also asked him to get medicines for my Grandfather. He will be coming. - those will not work for me, I need toddy. Shut up ! you became ill because of that. Look, there he is. (He is Rajanikanth, my Uncle's Son. ) Uncle ! -(What happened.) Police are thrashing, whomever they find. Get up... get up. hurry up , get up, take the luggage. -Let us go and hide.

Let's go. -Ok Go, stand on the road. if you are not beaten we join. Who dares to touch me ? I am the mason of a Police officer. Nobody can hurt me. (Grand pa, please stop.) Listen! Police siren. They have come. -You said you are Police officer's mason. Yes.. but, that officer doesn't understand our language. Don't want to risk. So I am back. Your grandfather is boastful. Don't make a noise. Silence. Hmm they left. -They are gone. Who are these ? Police hunt us, when we walk on the highways. they chase us here too. Come lets go, we have to travel a long way. Careful. hold the bag. Careful. let's go. Yes grandfather, I am here. don't worry, I am walking carefully. You watch and walk. Brother Walk carefully. Watch your step and keep walking. Ganesh. Yes grandfather. Ganesh , hold his hand and pull. Ok Grandfather. Careful. Sister, it looks heavy, give me I will hold it for you . Hmm, last two days, my brother is coming back of you. Do you know him before or what ? -Nothing like that, Sister. Looking at your closeness I felt he is taking advantage. No Sister, last time we met at Vijayawada, only then I met him. Is my Brother, acting smart ? He is jovial and funny with my grandfather. Be careful with men moreover you look fair. Also you are in the right bubbling age. They always fix their eyes on our breasts. If you give them little space, they start the work and reach down. If they find little space, they will take somewhere. They do everything and sleep as if they have done nothing. When we keep carrying and walking they joyfully walk with empty hands and come. What happend ? You got delayed. Do you need anything? I don't need anything, already you have given, enough. What are you both smiling about ? Nothing I was just telling her about workmanship of men. You go ahead. If you women have the company of other women to chat then you have no work with men. Where is the free time for men to speak ? They are always busy with work. If you do it once hard and leave, then for months we need to do all the hard work. Its is very heavy. Uncle, once hold this. Sister, I will come along with grandfather. ok, you go. You can get rid of your weight but it is not possible for us to do the same. What happened ? -Nothing I just want to walk along with you. Grandfather, What did you study? I have read people. I haven't read books. Moreover , during our time we did not have schools. oh you did not have. Savitri What ? (Even my grandchild did not study like me.) What is this ? - Hold it. Carefree. Last night I have seen blood strain on your dress. I thought you are feeling discomfort. No problem, take it. Even we have women in our home two elder sisters and one younger one. Even I know what are the difficulties of women. Just wait, I will call Kasthuri. Kasthuri... -(Yes brother. ) Come here. What brother ? Give me your bag. Go .. go along with Sister. What happened Sister ? Nothing..come. (What happened ? Why did you fall behind.) Nothing .. Come lets' go. If you go back of women, all men will left behind. Why should we blame them ? See only after getting paired with us they are facing all these difficulties. They should be taken care, like queens under the shades but now we are making them walk on the roads. (There is nothing wrong in it, Brother.) Even Lord Rama was not able to escape from this plight. Who are we? We cannot escape ? Nothing to fear, we will reach. With single word you have made him Lord Rama. We are all the Ramas and Pandavas who are in exile. In that context, your Brother in law is greater than all of them. Lord Rama, left Sita when she was pregnant. But your brother in law is walking along with your sister. All your husbands are considered Gods. You are men anyway. Even if you squander all money gambling, abandoning wives over suspicious gossips still all husbands are considered as Gods. Keep quiet. We are just chatting to forget our aching feet and legs. I think Sister in Law gets anger easily. My legs... you come here. Because it is very hot she may be little frustrated but she is very nice. I use to act in mythological dramas in the village. I met her there. She is from my caste. Their family is not that interested in me. She left all of them and came for me. After mariage , expenses multiplied. Left for a city that doesn't belong to us. City dumped us. (Someone fell down here.) Come . let's go and see. -Yes we are coming. Indistinct voices. (Leave room and let air flow freely.) (Don't go near there is some deadly disease.) Leave him. -Shut up, what are you speaking ? A man is seen fallen over here. -You will not understand. Rajini give me some water. Very sorry for him. Sister come. -splash some water, let's see. You move aside. She is afraid. -Pandit ji Pandit Ji.. Pandit Ji.. -Lift him up a it. Be careful, a little. Grandfather what happened? - Have some water. Mother what happened ? Careful, you may choke. What happened Pandit ji ? He would have got sunstroke. Walking in such hot Sun. More over elderly person. -Today heat is too much. In the nearby village went for a function. -It’s extremely hot today. After the function was over, they were not able to send me back. In these corona days I was not able to stay there. I stared walking After walking for four hours. All my nerves got twisted and I fainted. The pangs of hunger repeatedly need to be fed. No matter how many times we feed, still it asks to feed it again. Do you want to eat something ? -Don't be silly, caste people don't eat our food. They are Brahmins -Common why don't they eat. Sir have some. Please do not think otherwise. Eat slowly Sir. There is no caste for hunger. It will eat anything. There no God beyond food. It our foolishness. -You said very well Sir. Please give some water. -Here, take it. Drink it slowly. -Please be patient, don't hurry. What have I done ? -Give me Sir, I will hold it. Give room for fresh air. Let air flow freely, move aside. Move back, and hold this. Take the bottle. Arrange all things. Are you feeling better now. - I am feeling alive once again. So sad that he has become like this. Careful Pandit ji, hold it. Leave room for fresh air. Shall I hold this. Careful. Gather all things. All things are full. Let me hold it brother. -Your school bag is heavy. That is not that heavy Brother. Teacher said 7th Class Books are lot more heavy. Are are carrying all these books from Hyderabad ? -Yes. Please tell her, she is carrying useless books all the way. All girls should study. Sister in law. Because lack of education we are left on the roads. All the educated are in the houses and spending their time watching TV. Only we are suffering like this. You study well. You make her study well. (We can watch TV at home.) From when are you walking? We have started walking before Week to 10 days. If we walk for another 2 days we reach our villages. My village is near Tuni it will be nearly 60kms How long will it take? All of us are going that way. We need to go a long way. We are coming with a pregnant woman. We will be reaching. Did you take all the luggages ? - Yes grandfather Why are you holding your stomach and walking? I underwent an operation Pundit ji. The wound is not yet healed. With allopathy it is surgery for everything. Carona has come, and there are no medicines. But lakhs of rupees are collected in hospitals. Last year, my Son in law too had a Kidney problem they operated twice, we lost 2 lakhs. I don't have a white ration card. We should have money or Government Health Care being an upper class idiot I don't have both of them. My daughter became a widow when my son-in law body came home. What can we do ? It is the result of fate. What types of rituals you perform Pandit ji ? Rituals for Peace, Goddess of Wealth longevity and Satyanarayana Vrathas. I will do many others too. How much will it cost for Ritual of Longevity ? Minimum 2000 Rupees you can spend any amount To give that much amount first we need to do Goddess of Wealth. We also have a low cost package. If something like that is there you would have got it done. All this poverty would have been gone. What do you do ? -Construction Mason How many houses you built so far? I built around 20 to 25 houses. I also worked as Mason for 4 to 5 apartments. How many houses do you own ? I have none, I am not able to pay rents and so moving on the roads now. Excellent, people live in the houses you built and you don't have a house. My situation is also the same. It is fate. -(It is shady under the tree, come.) From the beats of wet heart we can hear a song. The hurt will be healed with the flow of sweat beads. Life will be a festival when walked together. Rivers will run with the desire to be hugged by the Sea. They will store so many stories. Will cross many sufferings. From the beats of wet heart we can hear a song. The hurt will be healed with the flow of sweat beads. The tree that comes out breaking the soil. will that not be a friendship that gives solace. Will that now be a shade that gives friendship and life that shares love. After walking for seven steps it will be one relation. We waked sufficient for 10 Lives my friend. The journey with you is unforgettable time. The blessing with you should be mine. (Don't get scattered, walk in one direction. -Simhadri don't go in wrong direction. ) (I am coming. ) (Left his mother and going with wife. -Savitry where are you?) (When we get our phones charged ? Not able to understand.) You were walking slow before now you are leaping. Oh.. really, that means my brother is not looking at your breast. He is seeing your heart. Good, but be careful. Look at her, she is always on her phone. Hyderabad love, she on the roads and don't know whereabouts of him. No charge for her mobile. See her pain. There is no smile on her face. If you are in love, it is like hell. It's enough Sister, don't pull her leg. I am telling about you. Love and itch are similar. Once we get, need to scratch lifelong. Walk fast. Are you coming or not ? Yes, coming mother-in-law. Marry whomever you like but don't become daughter in law of such women. She can't tolerate her Son sleeping with his wife. Are you coming or not? -I am coming Mother in Law. (Chatting is enough for her. She will not walk further. ) ('There is nothing to eat but want fragrant oils for whiskers') (She wears stokings as if she is a queen.) Mother in Law why are you blabbering ? - What else can I do ? Uncle, Brother in law there is a car coming. Stop the car.. please stop Brother in law no one stops. Only when we try we know. I wanted you and Sister to first get into the car. What about me? -If they stop you too can get in. He stopped the car. -Come lets go. Run fast.. stop it. Keep running -stop the car You agreed to drop me at Vizag. You are leaving in mid way. Why are you doing this ? -My Sister is pregnant, please. Why is he leaving ? What happened ? (-Why is he leaving and going ?) See that Diver fellow. He took money to come upto Vizag. Now he is having work. He want to go to his place so he left me in middle. I said I will pay him well. Even then he did not listen bloody rogue. True, he would have been a rogue.

There will be stories too. In Telugu, English and Hindi too. Then please tell me a story. Ok. I will tell you one Hindi story, 'Intelligence of a Farmer.'; Please tell it in Telugu. Ok, Once a upon a time in a village. There was a farmer. But that farmer doesn't have a farm to till. He went to forest and cleared some land. Meanwhile a Bear comes there and tells it's my place and you leave it. Intelligent farmer says lets' share the harvest into half. Harvest comes. Farmer brings all the workers in the village. Along with the villagers trashes the bear with sticks. With the entire harvest, farmer lives happily. It is unfortunate for the bear. Farmer cheated the bear right? Everybody is like that. After the need is fulfilled, they neck you out. After the river is crossed, burn the vessel. Thats it. These kinds of lessons are being taught in schools. That's why, I say be careful with educated people. It's not just the people even Gods are also the same. They churned the milk sea along with the Demons. When the nector came, they did not share and cheated them. When Rahu and Kethu tried to drink, they were beheaded. In Puranas itself, doing injustice is taught. Whichever Yuga it may be or whitchevery Nation. Once upon a time caste, religion and race used to speak. But now money speaks. -Yes yes This untouchability will always be there. Then it was because of caste and now it is because of money. Agreed. -After Carona everyone is untouchable now. We have been always untouchables. Well said Pandit ji. What's happening dear ? Indistinct voices Pain is getting severe. Let's get down at Visakhapatnam and join in KGH Hospital. It's very painful. -We will be reaching tonight. You can go and join in Visakhapatnam Hospital. Nothing will happen to you dear. Whoever is in the vehicle get down. We are warning you. What happened Sir ? Get down immediately. We are telling you. What happened ? Are your not listening us , get down. Get down. Do you want us to come up ? Are you coming down ? Police -Are you not understanding? Get down immediately. Get down quickly. All of you get down. -It is police You too lady, get down. You too. -All of you get down. Get down. -Come here. You have no fear at all What do you expect me to see ? If I come to know that your taking people on lorry. I will skin you. Bring the kids down and come. You look like an educated person. You are a software engineer and travelling with all cheap people. Don't you have the awareness of Carona Virus. I know it is wrong. I have no other option. My wife is pregnant. If we speak about rules educated people start speaking in English. Moreover keeping photographs and posts on Social media. Repeatedly doing mistakes. And again covering them up. Asking for pardons. Give all your details to him and go. All of you, from where are you coming from ? I am from Tuni, returning after performing a ritual. Next Month having Yagam and Minister's PA called. See Pandit.

Is it painful ? -No dear. If I was killed. I would never seen your smile again. Enough ! Why did you get so angry ? When they hit you. I was unable to bare it. Why do you take a life risk for my sake ? Only then I realised you are my life. When that *****, crushed my throat under his feet. You were flashing in my memory. I almost died. After my Mother and Mother in Law My Sisters It is you I care for. To leave and go is painful. Give it Brother. I will hold it. Brother, I thought I was dead. In a way, death too is like migration. Leaving all the loved ones behind and going. We don't even know if it is heaven or hell. Except the hope that we will return, we else we have. (run.. run. railway police are hitting.) Police are back again. Keep running Police are hitting. run.. run. railway police are hitting. Stop for me. I am coming. -Grandfather come fast. Keep running. A bike is approaching us. Someone is coming. be careful Ok. -Who is this ? Giri, stop. These are the people we are looking for. Stop! Where are you coming from ? Some are from Hyderabad and some are from Chennai. We are coming from Vartha TV Channel. Is it the opposition channel ? -Hmm Show us well. Atleast people in our native places should know we are alive. Tell us all your troubles. Viewers should weep after watching your sufferings., or else they will change the channel. Giri, are you ready ? -Yes I am How was your journey? Is it travel on flight ? to enjoy. we walked all the way. Walk ! It is a terrible walk. It is terrible for a pregnant women to walk on the road. Please tell. We are scared if we will be alive or not. We trust in God and we walk forward. See! how is this little girl weeping. What is your sorry ? My father is operated. It is so difficult to walk. But the Police have troubled us physically. They crushed his neck stamping with their feet. You are wounded badly. Tell No one cares about our lives. when people want labourers and menial workers only then they need us. only to remove and clear the garbage but we do not know a way to lead a dignified life. Everyone needs our blood and sweat but nobody bothers about our hunger. Do not do anything for us just treat like humans. This government has done injustice to us. They opened the liquor shops but have closed saloons. Look Sir! people without haircut and shave are looking like mad people. Sir, please get the saloons opened. Actually. When Government wanted to announce lockdown. if we were given enough time, we would have gone to our native villages. Why all this suffering ? Let's go Sir please show us well. Girl, zoomin Close-up for me. ok -Yes (Brother you forgot to wear your mask.) (Face will not be visible if we wear mask.) Ready. This is the plight of our nation. Even after 72 years of Independence Government is not able to understand the problems of migrants. In the year 1947 How people migrated between the borders. This is similar exodus. It is very sorrowful. Thousand of Crores of packages have been announced by the ** and **** Minister. They should feel ashamed looking at the old, the pregnant and children walking. Raman with Cameraman Girish Vartha TV Hello Sir Sir No issue Sir. Will file a new story in one hour Sir. Sir thank you. Will change the logo Sir. Thank you Sir Change the logo. -will change it.

I joined in Meka TV. Oh, that channel which always flatters the Government. Yes, thats the one. If you appear happy and joyful. I will show you more in the TV. Livelihood is only when we praise the king. Our elders have done it, once upon a time. we too are following them. You said it remarkably. How did it feel walking with the migrants? What shall I say ? This is a very great experience. This is the meaning of Universal family Hindu dharma also says that. To walk together. You have said it very well. Now you say it , Sir I am very happy. If we get Carona like this, every year. We all can walk together and go. Just like going for a picnic. It's like going on foot to see Lord Venkateswara on seven hills Feeling very happy to return to our native villages on foot. Our Country had given Power to people who hiked on roads. So many of us our doing hiking here. I think one leader will emerge from these people. Let's thank all the leaders who have helped us so much. Let's clap hands with respect. - Yhea let's all clap. We take leave. Show us well. Let's go. what's all this ? You have witnessed how migrants are happily walking . On the roads they paved. They are going to their native villages. Being one with the nature. Cheering and wishing the leaders they have elected. Walking magnificently with self-confidence and with so many dreams. It is extremely hot. Here they are feeding food. Come. Savitri look there. (Do you want to eat? - Lets eat.) Even you haven't ate anything from morning. God, how many incarnations you take to help us.

Hmm, I think your village has come. We almost reached. Need to travel 15 more kilometres. After the next junction, another 2 to 3 hours. First if I can leave Sister and Brother in Law. I will be relieved of my worry. They are Motherless children. Moreover this fellow is idiot boy. I don't know how to bringup a family. But leading life like that. Everything will be fine Uncle. If we are with her, she will take care of everyone. In whichever house she lights a lamp, they are fortunate. If she shows me a monkey and tells I am going to wed it. I will hold his feet and get my granddaughter married. I don't have any caste feelings. -It's enough, finish it soon. We should take Janaki sister before the sunset. Sister wait, I am coming. -Hurry up everybody. Don't bother her words. It is normal for us. She is showing off. As if she is the only lady ever got pregnant in this world. Her father doesn't have even food to eat. She poses as if she is a landlords daughter. She hasn't brought even a dime as dowry. Fascinated by her fair skin, my son is always behind her back. My son is like a sparrow. 24 Hours a day , he sleeps with her in the room and doesn't do anything else. She enchanted my Son and playing games. When you get married and have a Son. Never get such a kind of women as your daughter in law. If we fall sick and get bedridden She will not even feed rice water. Bitch (Mother, she is getting pains, come.) -What other work I have, wait. Coming. Pain, I am unable to bare. -ohh what happened dear. Indistinct voices I will go and check if there is any place. Indistinct voices Why is he running like ? -pain , pain.

Don't change your phone number. I will call you as soon as I reach home. Ok. Rajini bring some water. indistinct voices. How is she? Your Sister has less substance and more of showoff. Once you agree for midwifery, you should hold if a baby comes out or shit. She is in hurry as always. Ok Mother in Law, you keep calm. Hold her waist. -I am back, it will finish soon. Nothing happens, hold the pain. Rub her hands. Keep your hand near her stomach It is finished, just hold for a while. Rub her hands. Hold her hands. Who is on the phone Sister ? Is it your boyfriend? -No, nothing like that. I know sister. I listened when you are speaking to Savitri Sister. Yes. In my school too, many have affairs Sister. Do you also have ? -No Sister. My Parents wedding was a love marriage. Mother left all of her kin and came. When she remembers ,she sits alone and weeps. It is painful to leave Mother and Father. Mother loves Father so much. Even then it is painful. Mother always tells not to marry without elders consent. Will you get married with their consent ? Baby is born. -Nagu.. Nagu Girl child is born. -Thank God. I am blessed with a daughter. I have said before everything will be fine. How is Sister ? Both Mother and Baby are fine. They are doing good. Is there any problem? -No, they are safe. Girl is looking very beautiful There are fine. Both of them are safe. Here after your fortune will change. You are blessed with Goddess of Wealth. You got a sister now. Where is Rajanikath ? -He went into garden for water. (Rajanikath .. Rajanikath. Were have you gone ?) Dear, the girl is born very beautiful. Really! -Yes Father , small girl is so beautiful. She is having tiny hands and legs. Daughters are always beautiful. -I will go to the little baby girl. Every family should have a girl child. Look, it is so joyful to watch her. Yes, Thats is my fear. Despite my looks the mason would molest me with his looks. You know how many times he grabbed my hand. She is born in our home, so beautiful. Thats my fear. She is a princess. Why will she have our plight. Some Prince will come and take her on his horse. Won't you stop your theatricals even is so much pain. If we stop the drama, life will end, dear. This black one is gold to you. What is there in a colour ? This is the disease inflicted to our brains by the English. It's your glow. Beauty is essential. Look! How beautiful you are ? Dear, what happened ? (-moaning in pain) It is paining very badly. Dear.. -I think it is oozing puss. Can you change the bandage ? -Yes dear, I will. Rajnikanth.. Rajnikath.. -Yess I searched all those places. There is no water there. You sister is blessed with a baby girl. -Oh really. That means I have become Uncle. My Mother's sister is reborn. But, your sister suffered so much labor pains. -Yes.. If you want to give life, struggle is must. It is not so easy to become a mother. Didn't I tell you my mother died while giving birth to my brother. I have seen the same agony in your Sister's eyes. Do you like kids ? -Yes.. I like them so much. Not just one or two like the city dwellers. Wish to have four or five kids. Oh.. so many times. I may not be able to bare the pain. You, silly girl. Are you scared of pain ? Yes -I don't like kids that much. If you hold them, they pee and shit on you. Entire body will stink. There will not allow to make romance with wife. Hmm.. -dear you like kids, I will bear children. Will you conceive? -hmm yes. Please don''t proceed. Told you that I am in periods. If not, do you like it. -hmmm yes Go away. -Hmm Savitry Will you come with me I will give you anything you ask.

Travel safe. -bye Nice they are finally going. Did you see your sister, after Baby is born, she bothers none. Even the Baby stopped crying after holding Mother's breast. Mothers will not have concern on husbands after kids are born. I will not do like that. Will you give only one breast to your kid. Stop it dear. What to stop dear? Rajanikanth.. Brother in Law is coming -Ok Brother. Let me go. -Where do you want to go ? Grandfather is calling. -Ok go. (Savitri) -Grandfather I am coming. Yes Brother in Law come forward I am here.

You are educated, How can you do this ? Do you know ? How dangerous Carona has become. None of them is having mask. You are travelling with them. What are you saying Sir? Journalist who interviewed us too didn't have. Whats big deal if we don't have? -They will not have. There is no rule that. People who preach should practice. Is Trump wearing a mask? Our ** and ***** wearing? Incase they get sick, they have corporate hospitals to take care of them What do we have ? We don't have money to buy masks. -At-least cover with cloths. Masks are not to be tied to ears. -Please forgive. Which way are you planning to go from here ? We want to go across Pakirevupeta. Near that check post, all people who are coming by walk are quarantined. Watch and go. - I know a loop line passing it. Ok -Brother in law, let's go. If quarantined , we will be kept for 14days inside. Can we take any of them with us ? First keep the luggage in. After 7 PM it's curfew. Can't we take any of them with us I feel selfish and guilty leaving them. It's not possible. Only both of us have permission. It is surprising to see you thinking of others. It's a new lesson for me. I learnt a lot. -Bye bye.. Grandfather , how far should we go still ? -Come .. come Yhea coming, my back and legs ache. -Even my legs are paining, come. Father.. -ok dear Brother, what happened ? - We are stopping here. Shall I help you. -No thank you. What more one need then a helping Brother? What happened why did you stop?

Go and inform them that we will be staying here itself tonight. Go right now. Why have you become like this ? All of a sudden. If I die, would you take care of the children well. What are you speaking ? Will you kill me hitting harder. What are you speaking? Are you out of your mind ? -No dear If I die .. die Should not speak these words in this twilight hour We have two children. How can I take care of them without you ? You brother will destroy us. We have not even a penny in our hands. We don't have even a cent of land. I have no strength to protect a girl child. I have no capacity to feed the kids. Please don't say that I am getting scared. Why are you scared ? You are the great Savitri Will you not fight with God of Death and bring me back ? I am scared dear. I got used to living with you. I don't want to leave you and go.. Gowri Nothing will happen. Don't be afraid. I want to see the little one once. -Chinna your father is calling, come once. Don't leave us and do injustice. Listen to your mother and take care of mother and sister. Yhea I will take care. -Don't trouble your mother. Gowri, Kasthuri is very dear child. Don't scold her. Let her study well. Indistinct Voices I know Narayana Rao Garu, very well. Please call him, I will speak to him. What happened ? -They have kept fence and not allowing. Oh Really ! -Yes Do you want my books ? -Yes, they will have pictures in them. There will be plenty, If you promise to study will give them. Yes I will study. Indistinct Voices. Even you like to study right? - Yes I like it very much but Mother dosen't? After my father became sick. My Mother dosen't like me to study. I am not helping my mother with her kitchen work. Very sad, her health too is spoiled. (I will speak to them. Please wait.) Will you stop studying because of that ? (I know Narayanarao Garo well.) Here after I will do any work my Mother tells me. I will not disobey her. You should study really well. (Narayana Rao Garu is coming. ) (What is the issue about ?) Greetings Sir, Narayanarao Garu Greetings Who are you all ? Greetings to you Sir, Narayanarao Sir Did you remember me ? You Are ! -Two months ago I performed Puja in your house. I remember you. How come you are with them ? God directs our meetings and journeys. This is also like that. If you allow us to go will stay in a temple in next village And start our journey tomorrow. Situation is terrible. There were three cases in the nearby village. Everybody are scared. I am a Brahmin who liked to work but not to ask anything. You are God like Person. Please don't say no to our request. God himself was not able to do anything. And kept his doors closed. See Sir, in these times of crises. God will not be in the temples. He will reside in the hearts of people like you. Please don't refuse our request. Please let us pass through this road. -Please allow us and accept our request. Ok.. You may go. -Thank you Sir. Come let's all go. - Thank you Sir Brother ! Where is Brother and Sister in Law ? Mother asked to inform you all that we will be staying there tonight. Shall I come there for help ? -Not required brother. My Mother will not have anymore trouble, I got rid of my books. I will do whatever my Mother asks me to. -Tell Brother I will meet him in village. Go Safe. Pandit Ji and Grandfather, I am leaving. -God Bless you, go safe. Take care. Ganesh Bye, Study well. -Ok Sister, I will Let us go. - Bye (Mother.. let me loose. leave me. ) (Mother please leave me, I am not able to breathe) -(It is over my son.) Mother, what are you doing ? Leave Brother. Father, get up , getup Father. Mother what have you done to my brother ? They left us. (He promised to stay with me but ditched. ) (He cheated me and left.) Let's also go. (Come let's go.) -Father.. get up father. He left us all and went away. Mother I will do whatever you ask me to do . I will also work as labourer if you you ask me to. I will also work as a maid. Please leave me mother. We don't have anyone. Everybody is in their own works. It is getting late. Come dear. Mother I even left my books and came. No one cares for us. You come dear. Mother is there is no other way. -No dear , there is no chance. I will sing your favourite song. Come to me. Mother I will never ask you to sing. It is getting late, and getting dark. Please come. Mother I will not trouble you in any way. Please Mother. (Please leave me mother.) Can't you avoid to go back. Contractor is calling on phone repeatedly. Works stopped, as I am not there. Said he will arrange bus for all also said he will increase the wages. As all works stopped contractor suffered huge loss. I feel sorry for him. It's enough. Are they ever concerned about us? Even you clapped your hands and lit lamps at their buildings. Then they left us to go on our way. Their selfishness is much more dangerous than this Carona disease. Why do you say that you want to get back to them? Yourself said that selfishness is a disease. Why should we get that? My grandfather said Even migration is an addiction. You are affected by that. It is not like that dear. If we workers don't go back to City only then they will understand our value. It is not just us, even they have our need. But what will we do, staying back here. You can build castles even with mud. Nothing is impossible to you. Wherever you are you can build a City. If we stay back They feed us with free ration and food for work . They will stop us at survival. If everything is given away for free What will be left to develop ? We should be allowed to live on our own feet. If men are fed food everyday but not given the opportunity to grow it. They will be reduced to a beggars. Our leaders don't like us to grow. They get votes only when they are poor people. It is not just surviving. We need to grow. Even if you move to city who is allowing you to grow. Let's question, fight. If they again leave us on roads we will not tolerate. Even they have changed. -Hmmm Time has value, only when we trust tomorrow. Will you come with me ? Life is so good, walking along with you. If its to live with you, I can do anything. I don't trust the city. But I believe in you. It is not just living in City with you. Even it's forest I will come with you. Do you educate your kids in Convent ? Will join them in school. I will make them study well and I will also take my wife on an aeroplane. Really -Yes will take care of you like a Queen I don't want any of them. Will you be with me, always smiling and making me smile. Do you have tickles ? This is not the way to make me smile. -come You should take care that my feet don't get hurt. Come I will carry you. hmm.. Hei Gosh! You are heavy than a cement bag. I thought you can carry me. Can't you carry. You are a great Mason and you said you want so many kids. I am the mason , both for you and the house. Will you carry me everyday. -Yes I will. Why did you put me down so soon? -Yhea it enough It's not possible for me to carry everyday. Don't you want it everyday ?
