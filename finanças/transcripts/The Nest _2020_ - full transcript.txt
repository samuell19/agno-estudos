Arthur Davis please. Who shall I say is calling? - Rory O'Hara. - One moment. About fucking time! Hello, you old bastard. Hello, and how are you, dear boy? Good morning, my darling. Thank you. All right, all right. Good morning. There you go. Thanks, Rory. Thanks Dad. You're disgusting. Knock it off. Have a good day, bub. See you later, Dad. Later shit-for-brains. Yesterday, President Reagan announced that effective May 19th, quotas would be set on imports of chocolate, apples, pear juice, and lower priced white wine, coming from members of the European community. The US consumer will no immediate. Bill, I know you'll figure this out for me, thank you. Bye. Hi Margie. Hi Al, here's rent for me. I'm sorry it's a bit late. No problem, I told Joe you'd be a little late. You also owe me directly for two lessons, three after today. I have cash for the days that I owe you already. That's fine. Watch your hands. Remember, your spine into his spine, think forward. Keep going! Halt, halt, halt. Get your reins, yeah yeah, walk on. Walk on. Get through that wall now, look where you're going. Good. Better. Now what's your leg doing? Is it, is it squeezy? Beautiful. Yes! Yes! Nine-nine, next goal wins old man. Old man. Yeah. Yes, champion of the house! 10-nine. 10-nine. staying for dinner? No thanks, I gotta get home. - Later. - Later. Hi. Dad cheated. I didn't. I didn't. What is it? I think we need to move. There's an opportunity. Where? London. Go fuck yourself. Things are drying up here, for me. What are you talking about? I thought things were great. Mm-mm, I'm running out of options. But money's fine, right? Yeah. Right? Yeah. So? - Won't be soon. - How soon? It's not your concern, because I'll take care of it. It is my concern when you wake me up in the morning and you tell me we need to move. I didn't say that, I said, there's an opportunity. Arthur Davis has been in touch. He wants me to head up a new division of his company. You want to go back to Arthur? It's not going back to Arthur. It's me, having my own company, backed by Arthur. Look, London is about to be booming. Regulations are changed, the culture's changed. This is a chance to make some real money again. We do this, it changes everything. Stop, Rory I don't want to change - everything. - We'll build you - your own stables. - Stop trying to sell me on it. I wouldn't have to sell you on it, if you had some vision, you're so fucking risk-averse. You shouldn't be working for someone else. Hmm? Be your own boss. Build your own place. Own your own horses. This'll be our fourth move - in 10 years. - Don't look backwards, look forwards, this is a fresh start. This was our fresh start. This was our permanent move, remember? Well, things don't always work out as planned. Things never work out the way you plan. I moved back here for you, to be near your family. It's not working for me. I don't know what else to say. For fuck's sake, Rory. Oh oh. Come on. Come on baby. All right. Something doesn't feel right, Mom. Oh please, it's exciting. Most people never get to live overseas, so just go with it okay, don't worry so much. If I don't worry, nobody will. It's not your job to worry, you leave that to your husband. It scares me that you actually think that. Why give yourself the added stress, huh? You know it's taking a toll on your face. No it is, you're too young... Okay Mom, thanks. You always try to make things more complicated than the are. I'm not the difficult one here. I know you're not. I'm just saying that these are his decisions, and you just accept that, and you will feel better. That's all I'm saying. Well it does worry me that he doesn't have any family over there. It's not his fault. I'm not saying it's his fault, I'm just saying he doesn't have any... It sounds like you are. People, I'm not, I'm just. I can't believe it. What? I actually might miss you. Of course you will baby, I'm your mama and I'm a good time. Yeah. How about this? How about this? Hello. Love you so. Did you miss me, I missed you. How about this? Hi ya. How are you? I'm okay. Oh, excuse me please? Take a photo of me and the family. Not a problem at all. It's that one there. Excellent. For smiles. That's lovely. - Fantastic. - Thank you. Oh wait, Sam, Sam! Sam. You're missing the photograph. One more? Okay. Are you jet-lagged? A little bit, yeah. That's fine. Thank you very much. It needs work but it's incredible isn't it? I paid the rent for the year, with the option to buy. Hey, these floorboards were laid in the 1700's, when the place was remodeled. Still in perfect condition. Look at this, Bean, look at this. This table, Elizabethan style, well over a hundred years old. And this is a good story, the estate agent told me, it's always offered to the person whoever takes over the lease, because it's so bloody big, it doesn't fit in most houses. This is beautiful. They don't make things like this anymore. Yes Sam, that's all for you. Oh my God. Oh my God. Boring. Oh my God. Beg, beg, Sam. Secret door. Oh, Led Zeppelin, Led Zeppelin stayed here while they were recording one of their albums. Wait wait wait, you haven't seen the best bit. Your own football pitch. Oh my God! I started planning with the contractors. We're building a six-stall stables, and an outdoor school, right there. Everything here on the property is perfect. Al, it's what we always wanted. What's the rent? Less than you think. Rory, it's too big. Well, we'll close the doors on the empty rooms. We'll fill them eventually. We'll fill them with us. You'll love it. We'll go for lunch, and see if there's any common ground. Look, you'll be the last person I call every evening. I expect to be the first person you call every morning. All right, love to Dorothy. Bye. I trained you well, Rory. Anything I've learned that's worthwhile certainly didn't come from you. Who was that? Ed Taylor. Speaking to him directly? Of course. He loves me. Impressive, any other updates? Plenty. Chop chop. The prodigal son of a bitch returns, eh? Oh my god, when did you get so old? Come here. 10 years. God, you took to America well, didn't you? It's really good to see you. We'll catch up, probably soon. Yeah yeah yeah, when you've got time. Hey hey I'll take my two weeks and a season at your fish. Don't worry, this could be described al ego. They want to vilify deregulation and privatization, but it's gonna show the ordinary person how to expect more, how to want more, how to be their own boss. In America, everyone believes they can be anything. Here, you're supposed to settle for the station you're born into. This country needs to move with the times. And that is why we've brought him in. Ruthless vision for the future. I'm sorry I went off on one. Not at all, Rory. You're in good company for it. The gentlemen has taken care of it. Thank you. Thank you. Rory, you cheeky fucker. And she was like, it's not a hawk, it's a howk. Literally. What is her name? Missus Jenkins. Well that's bullshit, I'm gonna go down there - with you tomorrow morning. - Don't be stupid woman, Sam can take care of herself. Yeah, I can handle it, Mom. Well, she can't speak to you like that. Apparently she can. How's your school? You like it? Yeah, it's fine I guess. Best school around. A place I'd have dreamed of going to at your age. I had to work very hard to get you in, you're very lucky to be there. Yeah, it's great, all of it. I'm full, may I please be excused? - Of course. - Thank you. A little bit more? Hey? Hey, hey. Good boy. It's good to see you. Hey, could you take a break please? You're distracting him. No no no no no. Go on. Thank you. Hey. Hi. Gorgeous animal. How is he? Fair. Yeah, he's fine, he's a bit jumpy, but he just needs to run it off. Not so bad all this, is it? No, it's not so bad. Pardon? No, it isn't. I can't wait to show you off, tonight. - Yeah. - Yeah. Okay. God, God. Honey? This is Mister Donald Barker, this is Mister and Missus Rory O'Hara just in from America. Rory, you're the man of the hour, sir. Nice to finally meet you. Likewise Donald, likewise. My name is Allison, that might have been confusing. Absolutely ravishing Allison, it's lovely to meet you. You too, ravishing that is. So you're back here full time. Oh yes. I mean we'll always keep our penthouse in New York. We've just bought a beautiful farm, in Surrey, and we're thinking of a pier de tare in Mayfair. You might , he's my estate agent, and he's brilliant. He will get you to the head of the queue for the best properties available. Honestly, that would be fantastic. Really, thank you. So what did you do in America to make you so legendary here? Hardly legendary. Come on. Well I was with Salomon trading oil till '79, and I got sick of working for other people. I saw an opportunity. Patricia, my darling, might I just borrow the lovely Allison for a moment? Certainly darling, handle gently. The people we're just about to meet, are unbearable. Patricia said we have to invite everybody, or there will be talk. I don't give a damn, and I wish she didn't either. If she didn't give a damn, she wouldn't be here. That is true. We take the good with the bad when we marry. Although I think that's all changing. People seem to want everything from their husbands and wives, and expect every need to be fulfilled. Maybe that's why there's so much divorce. Too much expectation. Well, I hope you're wrong. I think people should want it all. Looking closer, you are young enough to still be an idealist, but only just. You should probably go to bed. I'm not tired. Well, go get in your bed and play with yourself. Just pretend to be sleeping when they get back. Can I stay up here? This house scares me. Me too, very creepy fuckin' place, but I need some privacy, okay? You're gonna need privacy too one day, if you ever become a real live boy. I'm worried you're returning to your natural state of being a full-blown chimp. Shut up! Our mother is a liar Ben, haven't you figured that out yet? You were born a monkey. She just doesn't want to tell you. You're stupid. Get out. Go! Close the door. And I want to thank my darling Patricia for making these such memorable evenings. I also want to welcome home one of the most talented men I know, Mister Rory O'Hara, who as a dangerously ambitious young man, was my highest earner in the pit, for many years, until he was tempted away by the American dream. It's true. Luckily for us, he got tired chasing that dream, and wanted to come home. Rory called me about six months ago, and asked if he could come back in and work with us. He convinced me that he was exactly the right blend of old British, and new American, to take Davis Trading forward into the. You've been quiet, you were right. Well. What if I started calling Patricia, Patty? Or Trish? God, the formality makes me sick. Everything's easier in America. Why can't we just be American? All that Mister and Missus nonsense is what I ran away from. Well, you're pretty good at playing along. Am I? Well we kept the penthouse in New York. The farm in Surrey, the pier de tare in Mayfair. It's just small talk. Is it? I have to go into work. It's Saturday. I know, I'm sorry. Eh, I didn't think I'd see you back here. Well you know America's tired. I needed a new challenge. Oh yeah yeah, well you know you're successful when you get tired of America. I'm happy. You aren't doing too badly, you've moved up nicely at our office. It's been almost 20 years. Yeah 20 years. What are you working on? I'm just trying to modify the company. See? Bringing in new business. Right, you're a better man than me, thinking big. What about you, what are you working? Norwegian fish farms. It's not bad, mostly it's got potential. You make an offer yet? Well, I want to have more in order first. It's not a huge profit up front but, I don't know, it's got something, you know what I mean? Yeah, now it's not, come on. Hey hey, what the fuck is your problem, come on. No, no. Get up. Get up. Hey hey hey hey hey. Get on. The weather will continue to be a little wary although temperatures should remain steady. Here's the Thompson Twins, and "Hold me Now." I almost died lady. Let your brother take the front, he's not feeling well. You know he gets carsick. Are you fucking kidding me? Sam. Hold on sweetie, I'll write you a note. We're always late mom. Well I can deal with going to the shitty school, but I can't deal with being late every day. You won't be late every day. You will though. No I won't. I'm sorry, I know this is hard for you. We'll figure it out. I know it's hard for you, too. It's not hard for me. Okay, Mom. Hello. Here now? Listening. Eshan Markham Industries. They're based out of Chicago. I know them well, did a lot with them on natural gas in the Midwest. There's a good, strong shop, good people, good vision. I think they're looking for a London firm to merge with. I have 'em, I really have 'em in a very nice position, and I think you need to listen to their offer. Why is that? Because I have a strong feeling you need to sell your company. And I thought you were a commodities broker. Yeah, but I don't see markets, I see risk, reward, and money. Touche. A sale is a sale, an opportunity is an opportunity. You taught me that. Did I? Okay, tell me more. The industry's been in a downturn for almost a decade. By the end of the year, deregulation will be in full effect, and London might be the same again. And giant banks and American firms will buy up all your competitors, take the best bids from each, and make conglomerates you will not be able to compete with. It'd be one thing if you could offer them what, niche business, but you can't. You trade in agricultures and energies. You don't have the contracts the big boys want, so you'll be stuck in the middle ground between specialist boutique, and well-capitalized major player. Eshan Markham will quadruple your size immediately and for good measure, this is an interesting angle, I've been positioning the partnership as a 24-hour global trading firm. A few people have been doing it, but not in the way it could be done. And on top of all of that, you'll never have to work another day in your life. I already don't have to work another day in my life. Yeah, I know. You'll be able to get that yacht you want, sailing off the Amalfi Coast. Well? I'll talk to them. All right. All right. They move fast, they think we move slow, so let's change their perception. Get this started with some urgency. I'll see what I can do. Good. Fucking did it, I just got off the phone, Arthur's in. Whoa whoa he's in, or he's... He sent it to legal to evaluate. It's happening, it's gonna fucking happen. It's too good not to. So I'm out of a job? I'm out of a job, we're gonna be rich! No no no no, I can't just yet. I'm needing hours. Come have lunch, your work will be here when you get back. You know if I wasn't so starved I wouldn't come back. Then don't come back. Hello? Dave, it's Allison. Oh hello. What's going on? I haven't seen your guys here in over a week. We haven't been paid. What? That check bounced. Your husband said he posted us another one, but that never arrived. And now he's not returning my calls. Well, what are you calling him for? You should have called me. I'll get you the check, how much are you owed? 2,800 pounds for labor and materials. Okay, I'll work on getting you that check. But in the meantime, can you guys come down and keep working? I need this place finished. No, I'm sorry. We can't work again until we're paid up. I owe my lads two weeks' wages, and I'm out of pocket on the timber costs specifically for your stables. Yeah okay, I'll work it out, thanks, goodbye. These on the square don't come around often. Since you're a friend of Donald's I moved you to the top of my list, but we need to move fast. My concern is it's only got three bedrooms. Yes, but as a second residence it stands to work out fine. Of course. Can me and my wife have a moment alone? Please do, take your time. We can't afford to furnish the house we have. Of course we can. We just haven't gotten around to it yet. I just went to the bank, Rory. We have 600 pounds left. Well, I paid our rent. I paid for Ben's school. I bought you a car, I bought you a horse. I paid for construction on your barn. I spoke to Dave, the check bounced. He said you were sending him another one and you didn't. I will when I get paid again, Allison. And when's that? Yeah, just talking. I don't want to rush you. We're done here, we aren't interested. I have a huge check coming in at the end of the month, and stop worrying about this, once and for all. Really Rory, at the end of the month? Before the end of the month, in 10 days. What's it for? Don't worry, it's coming. I saw some deposits you made, it's nowhere near what you're spending. It's taking time, it takes time. It's coming. This next payment is the one. All right, well if you have all this money coming in 10 days, then you can buy me dinner, and we can order whatever we want. Of course. Of course. Are you ready to order sir? Yeah, I think so. We'll start with a dozen oysters, and the shrimp cocktail. And the princess will have the chateaubriand, and I'll do the whole roasted sea bass. Let's start with a bottle of white, and then we'll have red with our dinner, whatever you think goes best with our food. Don't look at him, I've told you what we wanted, thank you. You're embarrassing. And you're exhausting. How? Everything's gonna be fine. Don't give it her, she hasn't got the faintest fucking clue about wine. It's fine, we'll take it. Oh fuck. You're sleeping, I'll take the kids to school. And then I'll drive myself into town. I won't have a car all day. Whatever you want. I wanted to offer, so you could have a lie-in for once. That's okay, I'll take 'em. Thanks. Al, I need some money, just to get me through the next couple of weeks. No. Our account's empty. I need it. Well that's your problem. A few hundred pounds Al, don't make me beg. Thought you had a big check coming in? The one. It's coming. 10 days came and went a few times over didn't it? Well, it takes time. Stand outside. Really? No, no, no, no. Rear up. That's it. What's up, huh? What's wrong, sweetheart? Max Price, please. Rory O'Hara. I've already left three messages this week. Is he really gonna call me back? No don't tell me he's gonna call me back, tell me why he's not returning my calls. Hello. Fuck. Hey. Richmond? It's okay. It's okay, sweetheart. It's okay. It's okay, we got you. Okay? Just hold on, huh? Huh? It's okay. It's okay, honey. It's okay. Please, Rory please. Please, please, please. Hello? What's going on? I haven't heard back from Max Price. We pulled out at the end of last week. What? Yeah, I didn't like the terms. What fucking terms didn't you like? Excuse me? Why didn't you tell me? It happened last Friday. I could have fixed it, why didn't you let me fix it? There was nothing to fix, Rory. It just wasn't a good fit. Arthur, I had everything riding on this deal. Arthur, I need the deal. What are you going on about? I don't care what you need. This is my company, just move on. You're killing your company by not listening to me. So small-minded. Jesus, that's why I had to get away from here, small island, small fucking mentality. Watch your mouth in my office, Sonny Jim. Did you have any idea what we were going to do here? Shit. Did you even bother to look at the details? Or were you too busy celebrating? There wasn't a chance in hell I was gonna let them come in here and fuck with what I've built. None of that matters, the bottom line is what matters. You brought me in, to make you money. Right? You brought me in to make you money, and the best way to make money is to sell the company. Make the deal. I've known you a long time you little bastard. So I'm gonna be honest with you. You have a great mind, and endless charm, but you don't pay attention to the detail. I thought you'd changed, but you haven't. Oh, you know how to ride a wave in an up market. Well that doesn't impress. What impresses me, is how you deal with a down market, because that's how you build a successful company. You focus on the one percent at a time. It's boring and it's ugly. But it's the bit of the business I love the most. There won't be any business, there won't be any company. We'll be finished within a year. And we can have all the information in the world, and still be wrong. Come on. Get back to trading, Rory. You're good at it. Very good at it. For Christ's sake, do yourself a favor, and stop trying to make a killing overnight. Bring me something stable. Find solid footing on some good deals. There is something. Oh. I wasn't gonna say it until it was further along, but I might as well tell you now. Yeah. Norwegian fish farms. Excuse me! Are you all right? I'm sorry to bother you. I live up the road, but I really need some help. I'm sorry. Oh Jesus. Oh no. I'm sorry, Beanie. Is it all right if you don't call me Beanie anymore? Sure. I'm sorry. Don't be sorry, hon. She might have taken the bus home. I wish she'd tell me ahead of time. Are you upset because I asked you not to call me Beanie? Oh God no, sweetheart. Richmond died today. How? I don't know, I think he was sick and I didn't realize it. Jesus, Samantha the horse died. Please tell me if you're not gonna be there when I come to pick you up. Can you tell me if you're gonna be late? Oh go to hell. Let's just say, I get myself home from now on? Be nice to her, Richmond died. What? Mom. Yes? Is that you? Yeah, it's me Mom. Well you might have called. How did you know I'd be in? I'd have waited. Can I come in? How's Ron? Do you care? How's Ron, Mom? Same old, really. You could call him, you know. Does he have kids? Two, Gail's. Did you see 'em? The oldest is just like her mother, and I couldn't stand her. But the little one is a darling. I see her quite often. But less so now, since she left poor Ron. What happened? Wives ask questions they don't want the answers to. Not like in your day, right? Well I didn't need to ask questions. I knew your father inside out. Bless him. Bless him. So, what happened to America? I came back to open a London office. I bought a beautiful house in Surrey. Oh. You should come and visit. Well I don't know, I hadn't been invited. I just invited you. I have a family now, Mom. My wife's name's Allison, she's a beautiful blonde American girl. Oh. You have a grandson. Do I? Benjamin. He's 10. He's 10? Look, here's a picture of us in front of the house. You can see there's plenty of room. How would I get there? I'll come and collect you from the train. Or I'd send a car, or I'd come and get you, I don't know, we'd work it all out. I'd have to think about it. But I don't think so. I'd really like you to get to know Ben. Come and stay at the house. I've missed so much, what's the point? The point is, I'm inviting you to be in my life. I shouldn't need to be invited into your life. I'm your mother, his grandmother. He won't even know who I am. It's not like you called me, is it? I can't keep up, can I? Gallivanting all over the place. Sam? Ben? Samantha? Benjamin? Why are you yelling? Did you just go outside? No. Ben? No. I locked the front door. I walked around and I checked all the other doors, and when I came back the door was open. I didn't touch it, Mom. Me neither. Are you fucking with me, Sam? Fucking with you? I don't know why you're so angry with me right now. What are you talking about? I'm not angry, you're angry. I'm not angry. You just say you're not, but you are. Just admit it. What is happening? You're all strangers to me right now, all of you. Okay. Hi. Hey Dad. You want me to tuck you in? I'll come up in a minute. Okay. Are you gonna tell me the next time you plan on spending the night out? I slept at the office 'cause I was working late. Will this be a regular thing? If I need it to be. Actually I did call, but the phone's disconnected. Why didn't you pay the bill, hmm? First of all, you never asked me to pay it. Second of all, with what money, Rory? You have money, use it. I do not have the money. Fuck. See, Richmond died yesterday. What? He just collapsed underneath me, and he started seizing, and he couldn't breathe, and I had to get a farmer from down the road to come and shoot him. Fuck. Fuck, that fucking cunt! What? That fucking cunt sold me a sick horse. Fuck, I wasted five grand on a faulty fucking horse. Faulty? It's not a car. He was a living, breathing, animal and he died. We need to find out what killed him so I can fucking sue her. You're not gonna sue anyone. Hey, it's my money. I paid for it, I want answers. What did the vet say? I didn't call the vet, I just buried him. Oh well you really fucked this up, didn't you? Maybe you really fucked this up. Maybe you killed him by shipping him here. He was probably hurt in the transport. Or maybe it's this poisonous fucking house, there's probably lead in the water. There's nothing wrong with this house, nor the water. Everything is wrong with this house. It's horrible here, no one is the same here. - There's nothing wrong... - Nothing is the same here. ...with this house. You need to call the vet and get him out here. Well you weren't here, so you don't get a say, and now it's done. No I was working late making money for us. For us, for us? It's not for us. It's so you can go to fancy parties and tell people we have horses. It's so you can tell people that your son goes to the best school. You're a poor kid, pretending to be rich, and you don't give a fuck about anybody but yourself. When I found you, you were desperate, living with your daughter in a shitty little one-bedroom flat, and you, you love being able to suddenly afford a big house and nice dinners, and nice clothes, so don't tell me this is all for me. Well, look at me now, living in this shitty, fucking dirty broken down mansion? I don't want any of it. Oh we'll figure it out. But it's all gone. I used that cash to bail us out, so we could move and start all over again, and I'm tired. Right, I take risks. Sometimes I'm up, and sometimes I'm down. That's who I am, Allison, okay? And you know what? For the first time in years, I feel good, I feel myself, because in the states I was pretending for you, and I'm not doing that anymore. Here, I feel worthwhile. I feel powerful, I feel fucking invincible. Well, you're delusional then, because you have nothing Rory, we have nothing. And who's it for? We don't have any friends here, we don't have any family. Why does it matter so much to you? Because it matters, because it does. Because it's important. Because I deserve this. I had a shitty childhood, and I deserve this, and I deserve a lot more. And if you don't fucking understand that, then you're stupider than I think you are. Get the fuck away from me, pig. Right now. And there have already been dire predictions, that after the big bang, there'll be a bloodbath, as a multitude of firms struggle to survive. But what's actually does the 'big bang' mean? Oh yeah. Yeah, one minute. Oh one of the guys is bringing the wife tonight, so I asked Al, so she won't be the only one. Yeah, of course. So you're coming? Yeah. To confirm tonight. What? No, nothing. I'll, yeah? One minute. Thanks for this, Jim. Thank you. It's great to have an extra pair of hands around. How are you doing? Okay. It feels good to work. Good. I'll see you tomorrow. Why would you hurt someone? You're so gentle. Why did you do it? What happened? I don't know. They bullied me. Honey, who? Some older boys. Why didn't you tell me? I don't know. Hey, you know you can tell me anything, you know that, right? I didn't want to make you sad. Baby, you can never make me sad. You just need to talk to me, okay? I know something's really wrong with you and Dad. No, everything's fine. Honestly, you have nothing to worry about. Look at me. You have nothing no worry about. Who are they? My friends. From where? Around. How old are they? Really, you want to start parenting me now? Yeah I do, you shouldn't be sitting around with some random locals. Well then we probably should have stayed in New York. You know you can blame shit on me Sam, but you're the one who's going to have to live with your choices. I don't have to make choices, Mom. I'll just find a man to make my choices for me. Why are you trying to hurt me? I'm not. I need you to watch your brother tonight. I have plans. Sam. I heard you, mother. Your mum is the shits. Shut up. Yeah, let's go up to , we'll go wait for you, too. Fuck that, it's fucking boring isn't it. All right. Let's have here. Sure. - Yeah? - I don't care. Let's get some speed. I'm just kiddin'. Okay. How much is it? I've got money, I'll buy it. I can get a fuckload for 40 or 50 quid. Go. Yeah, okay. So? I've only been once to New York City. A bit scary, but I liked it. Not on the upper east side it isn't, near the park. It's wonderful, we'll miss it won't we? We'll always visit, especially in autumn. Or fall, they call it fall. New York is magnificent in the fall. And Allison, are you from there? Yeah, born and bred. Raised in New York City, one of the few. Oh really? You grew up in New York, so London must be a big change? Well, the winters are milder here so it's better for my work. Oh, what do you do, Allison? Well, I work on a farm shoveling shit out of pigpens. Well to those names surely. Obviously she's joking. No I'm not, I picked up some work. Well, you haven't experienced winter until you come to Norway. I'm sure, I'm sure. You know what the new places is to summer, Portugal. There's a development on on the Algarve, I'm getting in on the ground floor. I've already bought us a condo there. I'm bringing together equity for a group of financiers who are developing it. I tell you, the future of European summer, Portugal. Better than the Riviera, it's so bloody packed nowadays. There he is! Sam! I'll arrange the tickets for you. You're seeing a play, and the National Theater in London is a unique experience. Anthony Hopkins is playing there this year. Can you imagine being in the same room as an actor of that caliber? The proximity, the emotions you'll get to see, the ferocity of the performance like that. I mean it's only in the theater is what they say, only in the theater. You're so full of shit. Did you read that in the paper this morning? My husband has never set foot in a theater in his life. Please excuse me while I freshen up. Wives don't always know what their husbands get up to. Yes, especially elicit trips to the theater. Can we talk about the vision you've got for your new project? Please do, we were beginning to think you never would. It's beautiful. Do you want it? I'm sorry. If you like it you should take it. I can't. Seriously, keep it. Our aim is to provide a complete service so the clients will return. We've already begun to do this with oil, by purchasing... Will you excuse me? Purchasing shares in refineries. Al? Excuse me. Allison? Vodka tonic. Another. Oh bye bye, Adam, travel safe. It was a pleasure. Yeah, bye bye now. Sorry about that. Allison's fucking crazy. So it went well, right? Yeah, it was fine. It didn't go fine, it went well, capiche. Come on let's get... I'm all right. I missed the last train. I can't go home. Stay out with me. Stay out with me. I'm just a bit tired. Fuck off! When have you ever said 'no' to a night out with me? Come on. I can't, you know that. Me, why? I can't control her. She's mental, it's nothing to do with me. They weren't impressed by your bullshit, Rory. It wasn't necessary. You're getting wound up about nothing, this'll be fine. I'll follow up with them next week, relax. When you set out, they said they just want to work with me. Well of course they want to work with you, it's your account, I'll take a backseat. No no no no no no, you're off this, mate. You got nothing to do with this deal. Well, no offense, but there wouldn't be a deal without me. You were gonna sit on it for a year. Oh yeah? Yeah, and the way you were structuring your shit. All right, all right, you do things your way, I'll do things my way. Can we just talk about this in the office on Monday? You're angry because Allison fucked things up. I'm not angry, I'm not angry, but I am going home. You're serious? I'll see you Monday. Big night then? No, not really. Just been working too hard. What line of work you in? I pretend I'm rich. Why do you pretend? I don't know. Sorry. It is. I had a million dollars once. I was living in New York City. I had one million dollars in the bank. I thought it'd just keep coming. I thought that was it, I was rich for the rest of my life. And then, over time it just, it went. Now I have nothing. You have kids? Yeah I do, two. What are you going on about then? That's all that matters. Everything else is nonsense. It's the only reason we're put on this Earth, well, that and football. Yep. You a good dad? Yeah, I'm the best. I keep a roof over their head, I give them the best of everything, and I've never laid a hand on them, never would. That's the bare minimum mate, don't pat yourself on the back for that. Well that's more than I ever fucking had. We have to give our kids more than we had, that's it, that's life. Sort yourself out mate, get a job. Make a wage, you'll be all right. I want more than that, thanks. What do you want then, mate? I don't actually know. I don't know. I don't fucking know. What are you doing? Well you just told me that you're broke, and that you're a liar. Do you really have the rest of the money for this fare? Not on me, I said that. But at the house I do. I'll have to let you off. Are you fucking joking? I won't take you any further, mate. Sorry, don't trust ya, you can walk. Mate, I'm miles from my house. I can't fucking walk. Get out of my car. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck! Samantha? Sam? Mom? Benjamin? Mom? Oh my God, Beanie. What happened, are you okay? Ben, where's your sister? I don't know, she had a party, I stayed in here. Jesus Christ. Jesus fucking Christ. I'm so sorry, sweetheart. So sorry. Mom? What? I've gotta show you something. Mom? Mom? Mom! Let's make breakfast. Yeah. Yeah, okay, we can make this work. You want to put on a tea? I'll do the rest. Okay. Okay. Al? Will you come in here and talk to me a minute? Anything you have to say to me you can say in front of my children. I was thinking that you were right, and maybe living out here isn't such a good idea. We should get a flat in London, while I'm putting my own company together. Teaming up with Arthur's been holding me back, and I've got some really good leads, and if I have a place in town, if we're in town, and I can be home more, I could work more. Rory, stop. I'm sorry.
