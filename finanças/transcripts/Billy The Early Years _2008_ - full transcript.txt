Old Templeton: I mean, they weren't rich people, but they certainly weren't poor either, you know. I mean, they had a dairy farm, you know. Billy grew up in a Norman Rockwell painting.

Old Templeton: I began to pray, my face upturned to the heavens, tears streaming. And in a moment, a weight began to lift, a weight as heavy as I. It had passed through my face, my belly, my chest, my arms, my shoulders, and lifted off entirely. And I felt I could've leapt over a wall. An ineffable warmth, a warmth began to suffuse. A light turned on in my chest, and its refining fire cleansed me. I hardly dared breathe, fearing I might end this, or alter the moment. And somewhere, somewhere in that darkness, I, I heard a still, small voice, my own, whispering softly over, and over, and over again, "thank you, lord! Thank you, lord! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!" Old Templeton: Did I mention to you, that Billy... Reporter: Billy, what about Billy? Old Templeton: Well, the summer before he went off to college, he, he became quite the door-to-door salesman. [Bluegrass music] [Bluegrass music] Billy: Hello, ma'am.

Billy: Really? [Bluegrass music] Billy: Hello, ma'am. My name is Billy Graham, and I am here to change your life. Dr. Minder: You'll find the basis of our teaching here at Florida Bible institute comes from our belief in the inspiration and the authority of the word of god. Now, our staff is here to help you to inquire, to question, to learn to think for yourselves. We're here to guide and assist you in this, at times, difficult, but deeply satisfying journey. Billy: Whoo-hoo! Hey t.W, what'dya know about Florida rain? Dr. Minder: The term, "evangelist," comes from the Greek word, "evangelion." Meaning, one who announces "good news", and giving rise to the word, "gospel". [Bell ringing] Dr. Minder: Everyone, ah, please remember to sign up for the outreach program. Emily: Hi. Dr minder: Lots of opportunities for budding preachers, Billy. Billy: Preachin'? Dr. Minder: Yes, would you like to speak at the men's mission? Billy: Speakin'? Emily: Do you have a problem speaking?

And Dr. Minder, if Mr. Speaking doesn't wish to preach, I would love to honor the lord and share his word. Dr. Minder: We'll see, Charles. Billy, don't worry, you can, you can just serve dinners. Billy: Well, dinners or speakin', you can count on me, Emily. Ah... Dr. Minder. T.w.: Smooth. That went well. Billy: I don't know the first thing about preachin'! T.w.: You know how you were spreading the good news about Fuller brushes? Billy: Yeah. T.w.: Well, preachin' is spreadin' the good news about god's love. Easier sale, if you ask me. Billy: Yeah... For all who have sinned...! For all have sinned and fallen short of the glory. And entered through that narrow gate! For wide is the gate and narrow, and broad is the...! That's terrible...

I'll let god decide who goes to heaven and hell. And what about you, sir? Custodian: Honest opinion? Billy: Well, yes, sir. Custodian: Son, I've seen the greatest preachers of the day. They've all come through here, and they all have one thing in common... talent. So, I can spot it when I see it. And, trust me when I say this, son, you ain't got it. [Laughing] Billy: And broad is the road that leads to destruction...! I mean, this is all gonna take about two hours, t.W. [T.w. Snoring] Billy: Great, I even put him to sleep.

[Crowd laughs] Church leader: Uh, you about ready, son? Billy: Ready for what? Oh! Yes... ready. Dr. Minder: Go get 'em. [Clock ticking] Billy: Sin is missing the Mark! The Greek word for sin is, metanoia, like an arrow, aimed at a target, missing the bulls-eye! And we have all missed the Mark with god! And that's about all I know about the 144,000. [Clock ticks once] Billy: And what about David and Moses! [Clock ticks once] Billy: Is there anyone who thinks they have not sinned? You need Christ! T.w.: Hallelujah! Amen! T.w.: I'm gonna sit down now. Dr. Minder: Billy, I can't wait to see what god's got in mind for you. Billy: You mean that in a good way? Dr. Minder: Yeah, Billy. I mean that in a good way. Billy: Mind if I sit here? Emily: Sure... do you eat as fast as you preach? Billy: Nah... Oh, you were there? Emily: I was sure you'd noticed. Billy: I did notice. You were there, most definitely there. Emily: I thought... Billy: Yeah? Emily: I thought you did a good job. Billy: Really? Emily: Yeah, really. Student: So, being an evangelist is spreading the word? Dr. Minder: Yes, Billy. Billy: Dr. Minder, who becomes an evangelist? Is, is desire enough, or is it a matter of devotion? Dr. Minder: Well, for one, Billy, you need to develop good oratorial skills. And it cannot, and must not, ever be about money and fame. It's about "the call." It's about serving the one that died for you. It's about his message. Florist: I know what you want! A, a corsage! A corsage! Ha-ha-ha!

Young Templeton: Since this war has ended, people all over the world have been searching for answers. The innocence of our time has passed. The simple life that america has known is gone for-ever. The simple answers have given way to much more complex questions. However, let it be known tonight that the ultimate answer has not changed. [Applause] Old Templeton: Like a leaf on the wind. Billy: For the Bible says, "for god so loved the world, he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believeth in him, should not perish, but have everlasting life." Billy: And this is not only your great hope, but this is your salvation. It is your answer to life. [Instrumental music] Billy on radio: The holy spirit is dealing with your hearts. You come... you give your life to Christ. [Applause] Billy on radio: Come! [Applause] Billy on radio: Come down! [Applause] [Newsreel playing] Newscaster: Today, in the waning weeks of the European war, the world sees proof of acts of savagery, unparalleled in history. The supreme allies commander himself views the Nazi murder mills with his generals. Ld Templeton: I let Europe nd the aftermath of the war wash over me. But Billy, Billy's faith was unshaken by what he saw. How could that be? And then we came back. Billy: Ruth, I'm home! I brought Chuck back for dinner! Ruth: I'm in your office. Billy: Hi. Ruth: I missed you. Hello, Chuck. Young Templeton: Hello, Ruth. Billy: So, what were you doin' up there? Ruth: Oh, just measurin' for new curtains. Billy: Oh honey, I don't need any new curtains. Ruth: Well, they're not for you. Billy: Who are they for? This is my office. Ruth: Well, not for long. Billy: Honey, I have to have a place to do my work. Ruth: They're for the nursery. Billy: Well, I need a place to write, and do my sermons, and... Billy: Nursery?Ruth: Mm-hm. Billy: Nursery, like for plants? Ruth: For babies.Billy: For baby plants? Young Templeton: I think what she's tryin' to tell you is that you're going to be a father... knucklehead. Billy: You mean...? Oh, oh... I'm sorry, sorry. Ruth: Come and meet your daughter. Marjorie: Go on, hold her. [Baby crying] Billy: That is just the cutest little ficus I've ever seen. That's my daughter. That's my daughter! Young Templeton: Congratulations, Billy, she's perfect. Billy: She's perfectly wonderful. [Instrumental music] [Instrumental music] [Instrumental music] Old Templeton: How can there be a god in this evil world? You know, I had profound doubts, and I let my doubts guide me to questions that I could not answer. Reporter: Go on... please. Old Templeton: Dr. Reilly was the president of Northwestern Bible college. He says, to Billy, "I'm an old man, and I'm dying, and I want you to take over as president of my college." Billy Graham, I mean, president of a college. Amazing! I mean, he had a bachelor's degree from wheaton college in anthropology. I mean, that's it. All of a sudden, there he is, the youngest college president in the United States. [Phone ringing] Laverne: Office of the president. Can you hold, please? Mr. Wilson, can you field this? It's them again. T.w.: T.W. Yes, mighty interested. I'll, I'll get back to you by close of business. Thank you. Billy: Is that Los Angeles? T.w: It's their third call. Laverne: Here's your messages, Mr. President, and your magazine. Billy: Thank you, Laverne. Tell Robert hello. How much they have to offer? T.w.: Two-thousand for the entire event, but I told them we need at least 10,000. Billy: We need 25,000. T.w.: 25,000? Billy: What about Charles? Is he on board? T.w.: No. Billy: Then to do it right, we need $25,000. Reporter: Tell US about the scandal, Billy Graham and the picture holding the sack of money. Old Templeton: Oh, that. In those days, the, ah, the final offering in churches, and tents, and halls- I mean, they used to call it the "love offering." It would go to cover the evangelists' expenses and, and go on to the next campaign. And anyway, some ambitious reporter takes a picture of Billy with the money. It was nonsense. I mean, Billy made sure that he was accountable for every penny collected. He was completely transparent. One day, he said, "now boys, I, I want you to go to your rooms, and I want you write down the things that can cause the downfall of an evangelist." They all had the same items. And Billy said, "alright fellas, these are the rules: From now on, no man is to be in a room alone with a woman other than his wife." He said, "we're not even going to let there be a breath of scandal in this ministry." I mean, Billy Graham is the most scrupulously honest person that I have ever met. And when I needed a friend, he was always there. Young Templeton: Bill, how can anyone take the Bible as literal word of god? Billy: What do you mean? Young Templeton: Jonah and the whale. Do you think that a whale actually swallowed a man and spat him out? Or, or, or that god made the sun stand still in the sky. Do you honestly believe that the earth stopped revolving? Where is the hard science to back these stories up? And if the Bible is not true in each and every case, then doesn't that cast doubt on all of it? Billy: Charles, it's the word of god. Young Templeton: But what if it's wrong, Billy? Nothing more than feeble stories written by men like you and me, attempting to answer the great questions of life. If it's wrong, then what about the rest? Old Templeton: He went down his path... I went down another. Young Templeton: Good evening, everyone. Thank you so much for coming out tonight. As I look out, I see a lot of familiar faces. I've known some of you since you came into this world. I have seen some of you through times, good, and through times not so good. And it has been my honor, my deepest honor, to serve you. But I am here with heavy heart. In me, you put your trust for spiritual guidance, and I realize the responsibility and the honor of this. I realize it to the center of my core. And so, it pains me, but I must confess this. I find that I can no longer accept many of the tenets, the fundamental tenets, of the Christian faith. I see now that there are other truths- that there are other paths, other perspectives, other ways. So, to continue on this journey toward greater understanding, toward an ever-widening search for truth, I've accepted a position at Princeton university. [Instrumental music] [Instrumental music] Young Templeton: And this means that I am leaving this ministry. Billy: Charles Templeton is my best friend, and there is nothing dishonest in that man. And, because of a crisis of his faith, he felt a moral imperative to resign from his positions to no longer preach that which he could no longer fully believe. And that is not hypocrisy, that is integrity. And, I will not stand with anyone who will denounce my friend. Instead, let US pray for him. [Instrumental music] [Instrumental music] [Knocking on door] Laverne: Mr. Graham? Mr. Graham? Billy: Oh, I'm sorry, Laverne. Laverne: Well, you've been confirmed at the forest home conference. Billy: Forest home? Laverne: You'll be the youngest college president speaking there. It's very interesting... Dr's Evan and Hamilton, from Oxford will be there. And so will your friend, Charles Templeton. Billy: Thank you, Laverne. [Instrumental music] Mrs. Meirs: Billy, how wonderful to see you. Billy: And you, Mrs. Meirs. Ah, these are for you. Mrs. Meirs: Always thoughtful. Come inside, please. I think you know Dr. Bob. Dr. Bob Evans: Billy, so glad you could make it. Billy: I've heard such great things, sir. Mrs. Meirs: Charles! Young Templeton: Thank you so much for having US to your home. You remember my wife, Connie. Bob, how are you? You know, I, I just finished reading your dissertation on the Neo-orthodoxy and the barth comparative study, and I have to tell you, it is brilliant work. Dr. Bob Evans: Well, thank you, Charles. I'm afraid it probably created more questions than it answered. Young Templeton: Excuse me.Billy: Chuck, it's good to see ya. Young Templeton: Billy, it's good to see you too. Tell me, are you still speaking for god? Billy: Well, god speaks for himself, Charles. I just testify about what the word has meant for me. Young Templeton: Ha, ha, ha... Billy, Billy. The world has grown so much more complex, just in the last fifty years. When people seeking the truth can no longer accept the simple rhetoric that you were raised with and preach with. When are you going to get that? That old time religion, it's not good enough for me. And it's not good enough for you either, Billy. Connie: Charles. Mrs. Meirs: Outspoken young man, god bless his heart. Young Templeton: No, no, no Connie, actually, I'm actually, I'm doing you a big favor. You see, people no longer accept the Bible as being divinely inspired. There are too many inconsistencies, lapses, lacunae. How could any of US presume that a document written by men is the sacrosanct, inalienable word of god? It is a fairy tale. Billy: Well, 2.000 years ago, the Bible prophesied that god would gather his chosen people from the four corners, and reunite them in their homeland, and... Young Templeton: God didn't create the state of Israel... Man did. The u.N. Did, after six-million Jews, god's own "chosen people," were burned and gassed in the ovens of Hitler. Six million people, Billy. All praying to their god to be spared, and not one prayer answered. Is that your loving god? Can you find his face in the ovens in Auschwitz, Billy? Or the fire storms of Nagasaki, or the bombs of dresden? I'm asking you, how could a loving god have done that? Billy: Charles, god didn't do that. Man did... Young Templeton: Well then, he permitted it, didn't he? He stood by and you're out there, Billy. You're out there preaching the "good news." What good news? Billy: The good news that god so loved the world that he gave his only... Young Templeton: Billy, Billy. I believe that Jesus is the most perfect moral being in the history of the world. I believe that Jesus is the greatest teacher in the history of western civilization, and I believe that Jesus is the purest example of all that is good in mankind, and, and I do not believe that he is the son of god. He's the son of a man. I feel sorry for you, Billy. What you call faith, it is the death of intellect. Bob Evans: Billy, you all right? Billy: Yeah, yeah, thanks. Morrow: Listen to me, Billy. You're gettin' all caught up in, in man's prideful need to be right about these things. Let me ask you a question, honey. What is your "callin'?" Is it to go out and prove every word in the Bible, or is it, is it to open people's hearts and minds to the love, and healing power of our lord Jesus Christ? Listen to your heart, Billy. Billy: Maybe I'm just not cut out for this. Morrow: God is with you, Billy frank, and will never leave you and will never forsake you. [Instrumental music] [Instrumental music] [Instrumental music] [Instrumental music] [Instrumental music] Billy: God, if you didn't want me to preach, why did you let me believe? And if you want me to believe, why can't you just give me some proof? There are questions in this book that I just can't answer. So, give me something! Anything! Where are you? [Instrumental music] Morrow: Billy, you will hear his voice again. Catherine singing: ♪ to rid my soul... ♪ Billy: I hear you, lord. Frank: Billy, you will hear his voice again. Dr. Ham: Sweet Jesus, forgive their souls and heal our hearts... Billy: I hear you... Dr. Minder: It's about serving the one who died for you. Billy: I hear you, lord... Darryl: Can you help me preacher? Morrow: Listen to your heart. Billy: I hear you, lord! Ruth: I believe. K: On this day in Charlotte, e asking god to Grant his nation, a voice for the gospel, to the ends of the earth. By faith, we ask this in the name of Jesus, amen. Billy: I hear you, lord. It's by faith. And from this moment forward, I accept this work as your infallible word. By faith, because that is what the Bible says. By faith! Thank you, lord. Thank you...Thank you! [Instrumental music] Billy: I'm back. Daughter: Daddy! Billy: Hey, come here. How are you? Ruth: Hi. Billy: Hi. Billy: I love you. T.w.: Los Angeles called back... They raised the 25,000. What do I tell them? All right. [Instrumental music] Billy: I have a friend, a dear friend, who told me Jesus was a man, nothing but a man. Well, he was a man, he was human. Now, he was not a white man, and he was not a black man. He came from that part of the world, which touches Europe, and Africa, and Asia. And he probably had a brown skin. And christianity is not a white man's religion. And you don't let anybody tell ya that it's white or black. So who is this strange man who marches his way across history? Who can explain him? There's never been anyone else like him. My friend, who is an atheist, will tell ya that. He only had a ministry of three years, and yet 2.000 years later, millions upon millions, on every continent, bow down and worship him. Why? How is this possible? Because he was made to redeem US. He went up onto that cross to redeem US. And on that cross, he touched the finger of god in one hand, and in the other hand, he reached out, and he took your hand. And in that moment, on the cross, he reconciled god and man. And, I'm asking you tonight, to commit your life to him. It's tough, it's hard, and there are those who will mock you for it, but there is a joy and a satisfaction in living that kind of life, in following him, a Serenity that fills the emptiness in your hearts. And once you have it, you know where you are going, and you know where you have come from, and you know what life is all about, and you know why you're here, and where you are going when you die. Now, I am going to ask you to get out of your seat, wherever you are, and stand in front of this platform, and say, "by coming, I know that I am a sinner. I want to receive god into my heart. I want my sins forgiven. I want to know that I am going to heaven. And I want a new life, and I want it to begin right here. And I want it to begin right now." And you know what? It can. I don't care if you are a movie star, or the biggest drunk walkin' the streets of Los Angeles. God is waiting for you right now. Come down... Come down and give your life to Christ.
