The girl saw us! Nab her quickly! Don't let her escape! What are you all staring at? Come with me! Madam! What are you doing? Don't you know that you shouldn't try to get on a moving bus? What's the matter, Khanna? - Nothing! A girl almost died just now! Madam you brought your handbag and left your brains at home! If you got hurt, your face would have been disfigured, and you'd die a spinster. No! Even a blind man wouldn't mind marrying her! Want to bet 10 to 1? You! This is not the Derby for you to make bets. Sit in your place! Khanna! The last seat is vacant. Let the girl sit there. Rajesh, you just drive the bus! I know where the passengers should sit and stand. You always interfere in my work! Stupid driver! Stupid conductor! You argue with the driver! Shut up! Ma'am, go take that window seat. Pandit! Why did you stand up? She is young enough to be your daughter! - Bless you! Wow! You are so old! And yet you're ogling. Oh my god! What are you saying? What am I saying? Sit comfortably! And invoke the name of god! Shame on you! Pundit, you stop staring too! Madam, where do you want to go? Where is this bus heading? To its destination! Where do you want to go? I mean which is the last bus stop? The bus depot! Not depot! The last stop is the junk shop! Who said that? Father said it! You old man! The last stop of this bus is the junk shop? Do you know where your last stop is? The cremation ground! People will lay you down on the wood and burn you with kerosene! Move! Madam, where do you want a ticket to? The last stop. - The last stop is Goa. Panjim. Then give me a ticket to Goa. - Give me 30 rupees 25 paisa. Kumbkaran! Sit straight! Where is it? Is this a note? A thousand rupee note! - A thousand rupee note! Let me see. If you tear it, madam won't spare me! Madam, such a big note won't work for the Bombay to Goa route! I have no change! I am sorry. I gave it to you in my rush. I will give you another note. Wow! What a passenger! A 1000 rupee note or a 100 rupee note! I have sufficient change. Here is your ticket! Ma'am, I will give you Rs. 9.75 soon. Wow! Is this your handbag? - What do you mean? I meant hold your handbag tight! This is a bus! You may be robbed in no time! You! Do you have a ticket? Yes! I booked it 3 days ago. Come on! You! Ticket! Here! Mother! - Who are you calling mother? Sister! - Yes! I bought the ticket. And you? - She is my daughter. Did you buy a ticket for her? - Yes! Conductor, give my 70 paise. Wait! I'm not going to leave the bus and run away with your 70 paisa! Sorry! Who put this wooden rod in between? Conductor! What did you say? This is not a wooden rod. It is my boss's leg! You fool! If it is your boss's leg then why don't you put it up? Don't be insolent! - Don't touch me! Do you know who he is? He is India's greatest boxer John Ragada. He is going to Goa to fight the best boxer in the world, Clay! If you are insolent to him, he will break all your teeth with one punch! Let go! Why are you holding my chest? Leave me. Look, brother. We all are one, travelling in the same bus. So your boss is my boss. Your mother is my mother. My father is your father. Your wife is my.. What did you say? - My sister! So you're on the right path! - Yes! Boss! Shake hands! My hand! Look, I will give your change later. My hand is broken! Boss! That girl escaped on a bus to Goa! A bus? - Yes, boss. MP travels! Kalia! Fine! No problem! Come with me! Mummy! What happened, baby? - Look there! Shameless girl! She is powdering her face in front of everybody! Mother! - Mother! No! Sister! It's wrong to powder your face in public! But you can apply lipstick, right? Why are you eavesdropping on our conversation? With such a nice face, I'm bound to eavesdrop. You are a nice guy. You seem to belong to an affluent family like us. What are you doing? Please remove your fat hand! Which family do you belong to? The most illustrious family among all the stage artists! In my time, when I stepped on stage, it would shake. I am sure it must have! Even the bus is shaking! - You are joking. Look you make the stage and bus shake! Your daughter doesn't do anything? My daughter is being groomed. When she makes her debut on stage, she will become renowned all over India. I don't know about that. But she will definitely cause an uproar. Mother, no, sister. Sister, if you can't find a stage hero for your daughter, do keep me in mind. Maybe I could come to your daughter's aid! Would only you be left for my daughter? You idiotic man! - Wow! Hurry up! The bus has arrived! Come on! - Yes! Coming! Come on! You? - Wait! My husband! Your husband! Husband, hurry or your wife will leave! Come on! - My slippers! Your slippers! Kishore Kumar! Yes! Kishore Kumar! Move back! Move! Enough! Are you Kishore Kumar? - Do you think I am mad? Remove your spectacles. - What? Your spectacles! - Here! Yes! He is Kishore Kumar! But what are you doing here in this scorching heat? What do I tell you? My car has broken down. We were lucky that your car broke down. Or how would we have got the chance to meet you? Right, Rajesh? - Yes, Khanna! Rajesh Khanna? You two got together and decided on that name? - Yes, we are his fans! Fan? - Fan! But forget that! You are too good! I swear on god! You were so great in Aradhna! I want to touch your feet, I swear! I did not work in that movie. Rajesh Khanna worked in that movie! You were too good in Kati Patang! - Yes! Not I, Rajesh Khanna! Mr. Kishore, you don't understand! We are not talking about acting! Then? - We are actors. We are talking about your songs. You sang so well! That song in Aradhana! "A beautiful girl lives in the house opposite mine." That is the song from the movie Mehmood! Yes! That was in the movie Padosan! - Yes! "Queen of my dreams, when will you come?" And that one "In life's old journey." Not old, lovely. - Yes, lovely! Enough! If you start singing, I will have to quit the industry! Mr. Kishore, the industry will never leave you! But what were you doing here? I was on my way for the shooting of the movie Love in Bombay. In Panvel? - Yes! Your car broke down? - Yes! Then come by our bus! - Bus? Why not? Our bus is worth 1.5 lakhs! And your car is worth just 50 lakhs! - Not 50! Say 15 lakhs! Why do you want me to get into trouble with the income tax department? How can the income tax officers bother you? It's you who put the income tax officers in trouble! Lower your voice! Abdul! Bring the car when it's ready! - Let's go! Rajesh, start the bus. - Which bus? It belongs to MP travels. Kishore Kumar! - Kishore Kumar! Let them see. Come on! Don't worry. Come! What is it? Come. What? You all have never seen an actor? You Here, Mr. Kishore! Here is your ticket! But I was going for my shoot. I haven't got any money. Who is asking for money? I will pay the money to the company. When else will I get the chance to serve an artist like you? Thank you! - Mention not! Greetings, Kishore Kumar! - Greetings! Greetings! - Greetings! Which movie - Move! Thank you so much! Where are you going? - What? My name is Mala. I didn't ask your name. I said where are you going? Goa. - Goa! Do you live there? - No. My house is in Bombay. Bombay! Do you like movies? - What? I mean watching movies? - Yes. You have a beautiful face. You can become a movie star. A movie star? - Yes. No. - Why not? I hate actors! I understand. Maybe like others, you too have a bad opinion of actors. But that's not true. You find good and bad people in every profession. In business, society, government! It depends on what kind of a person you meet. 'Yes, Mala.' 'Before labelling others bad, just think.' 'Your craze to become an actress had blinded you.' 'And without thinking you got trapped in by a man so devious.' "My body is getting drenched in the cold water." "My body is smouldering." "It is making me go crazy. - Love!" "Now I understood. - Love!" "That's what happened to me. - Love!" "Because of it I am in trouble." "How do I reveal this secret?" "I can't even say it." "No matter how much I want to keep quiet, I can't." "Life is dull." "The air is moist." "What happened to me today?" "My behaviour is different." "What do I explain to you?" "The water is blue." "My body is wet." "My body is smouldering." "It is making me go crazy. - Love!" "Now I understood. - Love!" "That's what happened to me. - Love!" "Because of it I am in trouble." Mr. Sharma! I made all the enquiries. She is a golden bird. Her name is Mala! Her father Aatmaram drinks water in a silver glass and eats from a golden plate. And the girl dreams of becoming a movie star. Then my work is done. Come on! We too will drink water in silver glass. And eat from a golden plate. Come on! - Let's go! Listen. You remember our technique? Yes! - Then let's go! Excuse me. - Yes, what do you want? I am the photographer for a film magazine. May I click your snap in this dress? - Why? I will publish it in our magazine, and prove that there's beauty not just among movie stars, but outside the film industry too. Thank you. - Mr. Verma. Yes. - If she doesn't mind, send one copy of her snap to Sharma International too! Who is he? - Pardon me. I forgot to introduce him. He has just come down from Africa. Mr. Sharma. She is Ms. Mala. How do you do? - How do you do? But how do you know my name? This is strange. There aren't many beautiful girls like you in this city. One. - Or maximum two. Yes. And it's not difficult to find out their names. So what was I saying? Mr. Sharma has recently come down from East Africa. There he owns a big factory that manufactures elephant teeth. He has come to India to make movies, so he's looking for new faces. Is that so? I want to act in movies too. I won many awards in school and college for acting. Will you give me a chance in your movie? What are you saying? We need you. And you need us. Mr. Verma the snap must be true to life! Hurry up! If the drops of water on her skin dry up, the snap will not look natural. - Correct. You stand right there. Give a smiling pose! Click! - To the left! Excuse me, madam! Ms. Mala, autograph please! Autograph? - Yes! Who are you? - Forget who I am. I just know that someday you will definitely be a big film star! Then I may have to be born again to get to you! So why don't I take your autograph right now? Please, Ms. Mala! Sign on my autograph book with your delicate hands. Mister! Don't interfere in somebody's personal matters! Got it? Mr. Verma, click the photo. And you move! I won't! Go away! Are you going to move politely or not? Mister! I didn't ask you before coming here, and I won't leave just because you tell me to. Ms. Mala! Please! Autograph! - Look.. I think he wants to be beaten up. Ms. Mala, come here! Steady! Smile! Ready! One.. Stop! Hang on! Go ahead! Mister! What is going on? This is the limit of tomfoolery. - Who is jesting, mister? Look, you are looking for a heroine! And you are getting a hero with her too. Sign on both of us. Hold this. - Okay. I think now I will have to do away with decency. "I have given up decency." See, ma'am? I converted one into a fish! Now what do you want, mister? - I don't argue with scum. Ms. Mala! Hang on! Listen to me! Look, god gives beauty, but we have to safeguard it! You should be careful in your youth. - Come on! Whether you believe or not Is up to you. My duty was just to explain to you. Give a sexy pose! Yes! Don't move! Steady! Done! Thank you! Ms. Mala, what are you doing day after tomorrow in the evening? Day after tomorrow I have to go to college. I am asking about the evening. Come to Playboy restaurant, if you can. Playboy restaurant? - Yes. We couldn't really talk. Let us sit down and talk there. I will try. - Thank you. Bye. Is this how young girls behave? Did you hear me? Mala left for college in the morning. And now its 9 p.m. and she's still not returned. You give her so much freedom, she's getting ruined by the day. Wife, she is my only daughter. She must be partying with her friends. She will be back soon. - No! Now her partying must stop! She should be home before 7 p.m. And get her married to a nice boy as soon as you can. Mummy, it's better if you chain my legs, so I can't walk or go anywhere. Dear, your mother has been shouting at me for so long. I went to Rita's house. She insisted on having tea. I spent an hour there. We were all together. Rita dropped them home first. And she just dropped me. But daddy, mummy always scolds me. You've educated me so much, now let me be responsible too. Certainly! Look, mother of Mala. Don't talk nonsense about my daughter. I will say it countless times! People in the locality are so orthodox. Seeing a young girl return home so late at night, god knows what they must be saying! - Mummy, if you want, from tomorrow I will stop going to college. I will sit at home the whole day and clean or cook. Dear, what are you proposing? She will jump at it! Wife, when you have tolerated a man like me for 25 years, put up with this small habit of hers too. This is the limit! You're always joking! Dear, Mother scolded you. Not I. Don't eat for your mother's sake. Eat for my sake. Daddy! - Come on, dear! Rita! Why has Mala still not come? You know that she is always late. Hi! - Hi! Mala, you are so late! - I am so sorry! So what if she is late? At least she has come! Excuse me! Thank you! And now, ladies and gentlemen, we proudly present to you the one and only Usha lyer! "Listen to the golden rain." "Listen to the downpour." "And with every drop of rain, I love you more." "What if it rains all night long?" "Let my love for you grow strong." "As long as we are together." "Who cares about the weather?" "You came." "I was alone." "I should have known." "You were temptation." "You smiled." "Leading me on." "My heart was wrong." "You were temptation." "Married a female wrestler, as massive as can be." "And she had bulgy muscles which quite fascinated me." "She said she loved me truly, she also said by heck" "If ever I catch you messing around, I'll break your lovely neck." "What shall I do, how shall I love my skin?" "I married a female wrestler. Now look at the mess I am in." "Never know how much I hate you." "Never know how much I don't care." "When you touch me, you give me a fever." "You give me a fever but you are off today." ''You give me fever." "When you touch me." Fever, when you hold me close." "Fever." "My baby's going to give me fever." "She is my baby." "Don't mean maybe." "She is my baby." "Love my baby, love." "It's the wrong time." "And the wrong place." "Though your face is lovely, it's the wrong face." "It's not his face, but it's such a lovely face." "That it's alright with me." "It's the wrong song, in the wrong style." "Though your smile is lovely, it's the wrong smile." It's not his smile, but such a lovely smile." "That it's all right with me." "She is my baby." "Don't mean maybe." "It's the wrong time. And the wrong place." Stop it! I can't sing! I married a female wrestler.. Excuse me! Thank you! Mister! - Yes, madam! What insolence is this? Insolence? Here is your money! Why are you being my enemy? Enemy? Madam my intention is friendship. If you consider this enmity, I am very sorry! Because of you Usha lyer got angry and left! What if I say that she got angry and left because of you? Why didn't you let her sing a song of her choice? Madam! What is there to fight about? You wanted to hear your favorite songs. I wanted to hear mine. You are arrogant because of your money! Do you know who I am? Madam, I came to this restaurant to eat a chicken sandwich, not to ask your father's bank balance! Shut up! - You shut up! Ms. Mala! Come here! I will tackle this shameless man! Get up! What are you looking at? Get up! Come here! What is going on? Help! Stop! Move! Shut up! - Move! Is this a restaurant or a wrestling - Ground! How much is your bill? - Nothing! Yours? - Nothing! You didn't eat anything! And unnecessarily you made me suffer a - Loss! You come to the restaurant and - Fight! I will call - The police! Go! Thank you! One is tall! And one is fast! Are you hurt? - It's nothing, Ms. Mala! If that manager had not intervened, I would have thrashed him black and blue! - Yes, Ms. Mala! When Mr. Sharma started his elephant teeth factory in East Africa he would never buy the teeth of dead elephants. Then? - He would go to the jungle, pounce on a live elephant, and extract his teeth! Right, Mr. Sharma? - What are you saying, Mr. Verma? How brave! Thank you! Ms. Mala, you may be running late today. And your mood is not good either. So you keep this card. And come to my office tomorrow in the evening. Okay. Let's not waste time. I will take her to buy the costume and makeup. Tomorrow is her trial. First ask her if she wants to be a heroine. You are right. So Ms. Mala, what have you decided? Are you really asking me that? Oh no! I really can't believe it! Could I really be a heroine? Listen to her! What are you saying, Ms. Mala? Nowadays even ugly girls become heroines! And you can't? Features like yours - Even Sophia Lorraine and Elizabeth Taylor aren't so gorgeous! Right, Mr. Sharma? - Yes, Mr. Verma! Thank you so much! - You are absolutely right! Thank you so much! I am so thrilled! You.. - Mr. Verma, we are going shopping. Ask the cashier for 2000 rupees. - Mr. Sharma, did you forget? The cashier took half day leave in the afternoon. My Goodness! Now there is a problem! Tomorrow is Sunday and the shops will be closed. Yes. - We have to wait till Monday. Correct. - Why wait? I have the money. I will pay it. - Wow! On the very first day she has become a partner In our firm. And she is making the first investment too. Mr. Verma, how can we allow this? - What's the harm, Mr. Sharma? Whether you or I pay, it's the same thing. But the work mustn't be delayed. - Yes! It mustn't. Come, let's go now! - Let's go! Thank you! Cab! Now you will go home, won't you? - Yes. Fine. I have some work. I will get down on the way. - Okay. Come. Let's go. Okay, Ms. Mala! Thank you very much! And come tomorrow in the evening for your makeup trial. Okay. - Okay! Good night! - Good night! Let's go, driver! Good night! How much is the fare? What fare? I am crazy about you! You! Yes! I take any excuse to serve you. So go to hell! Ma'am, you are the one who is going to hell. Never mind. We will go together. Bye! Wow! Fabulous! What style! What grace! Here! Have some sweets! Today is your first makeup test. Take this. Enough applause. - Ms. Mala, I am telling the truth. The day you enter the film industry, all our heroines will be out of work! - Correct! Shut up! Sycophant! Take this. - Thank you, boss. Mr. Verma! - Yes! Why are we wasting time? Are her snaps ready? Yes! - Come! Amey, follow with the top. Congratulations! - Thank you! Steady! Stop! Now it's okay! - Ready! Wow! Ms. Mala! - Yes! Our cameraman, costume designer, makeup man, they're all smitten by you. And they keep praising you! And that's increasing my problems. Why? There is a problem pairing you with a hero. I can't find someone who'll look good with you. Mr. Sharma, why don't you approach a famous hero? Madam, I was thinking that too. But there is a problem. - What? What do I tell you, Ms. Mala? I hope you don't misunderstand. I closed down my business in Africa. But most of my money is lying there. Now, if I signed on a famous hero, I'll need a bigger budget. I want to tell you something. - What? Perhaps you may not like it. But now I don't consider you a stranger. If you can arrange for 1-2 lakhs, we can put together a nice proposal. Right, Mr. Verma? - Yes, Mr. Sharma. Signing on a famous hero will make her renowned. And our business will be taken care of quickly, too. - Exactly! That is what I am saying! You are thinking it over. Look, there is no compulsion. Think about it and give us an answer. - Okay. I will let you know in a day or two. - Certainly. Fine. - Take your own time! May I leave now? Bye! - Bye! Mala's mother! - What happened? Did you see this snap? She looks like Mala! - She is Mala! Look what is written below. Sharma International's new heroine Mala! Look! And see this! She betrayed us! Mala! - Mala! Mala! - Coming, daddy! What's the matter, mummy? Why are you both shouting? I am not shouting. I am lamenting my death reading this news! Look! Such an indecent snap. That is my snap! Daddy, what is there to scream about? It's just my snap that's published! This is not a snap! It's a slap on my face! Your mother rebuked me so many times for giving you so much freedom. And I because of my love for you always scolded her. You took advantage of my love and kindness! Daddy! Has anybody from our family had a snap published before? You should be happy, daddy Your daughter is making your family proud! If you wanted to bring the family fame, you should have set this house ablaze! There would have been a commotion. Why did you ruin my reputation like this? So what, daddy? - Now what is left? What will our relatives say about your obscene snaps? Mummy, you think this snap is obscene! But it has some value in the eyes of the world! This is an artistic photograph! It's not obscene. Such indecency can never be artistic. And your in-laws are decent people! They won't consider this snap a piece of art. If they are orthodox people who ride bullock carts in this jet age, it's not my fault? And what do I have to do with them? Daddy, today I want to tell you something clearly. I am not ready for marriage! I want to become a film star! What? You want to be a movie star? Now I know why you come home late at night! You have really deceived your parents! Today there was a debate, tomorrow this, day after tomorrow that! Is this what decent girls aspire to be? - Yes, daddy! That's what I want to be! Fine! Then this is a serious matter! Mala, if that's your decision then here's mine. From today your partying, picnics, gallivanting will end. Daddy! And from tomorrow you can't go to college! - Daddy! You will get married next month! - Daddy! Go! - Daddy! Daddy! Mr. Sharma! That's why I came here secretly to seek your advice. What should I do? You are my friend, philosopher and guide. Mala, you are giving me a big responsibility! Let it be. When you trust me so much, I too will stand by you at all times. Right now, I think Mala, there is only one option left for you. Tonight take all the money that you can from your house, and come to meet me. What? Run away from home? Leave my parents? Ms. Mala, you can't achieve success without sacrifice. Mr. Verma, you say something too. Mr. Sharma, what do I say? Ms. Mala, on one hand fame is beckoning you. And on the other hand the poison of marriage wants to grab you. Now Ms. Mala, you are intelligent. Think and take a decision. You won't get another chance. Got it, Kalia? - Yes. Come, Ms. Mala! Mr. Sharma, Ms. Mala has come. At last you have come. - First take this! Have you counted it? No! I took whatever I could get a hold of. Maybe it's more than you expect. Ms. Mala, we too will prove to be more than what you expected! Now sit here comfortably. Wipe the sweat from your forehead. You have left that world now. Why you are you worrying? Right, Mr. Verma? - Yes, Mr. Sharma! I will keep this somewhere. Listen! - Yes, boss! Look after madam! - Boss, I understand. Come. Listen! - Did you say anything to me? Did you say anything to me? Tell Mr. Sharma to come quickly! I will call him. Meanwhile you drink this. Have it. Have it. Well done! The girl has brought so much money. Ismail, here is your share. - Thank you, boss! Babban, here is your share. - Thanks, boss! Nasir! - Thank you, boss! Boss, my share! - Come. Gopal, you too. - Thank you, Boss. Junior, here! - Thank you, boss. You be happy, too. You take this, too! What about that girl? I gave her coke. In 2 minutes Stop whistling! Take it. - Yes! Now Mr. Verma's share! One! You should get double the share. So two! What happened? Just 2 bundles won't do for me! I want equal share in this loot! - Equal share? Yes! Don't forget that I enticed the girl who brought this money! Enticing Mala was not your cup of tea, Mr. Sharma. Give me half the share, fast. What if I don't? Then Mr. Sharma, you know what is the punishment for instigating an innocent and decent girl to commit robbery and luring her with the glamour of the film industry to leave her house? Meaning you have a plan that could get me arrested? - Yes! Mr. Verma maybe you don't know, but I don't spare anyone who antagonizes me. Got it? Kala Dilip! Come! What is it? Kala Dilip, leave him alone! This is our personal matter! Mr. Verma I am very sorry. Why fight over a trivial matter? You can take as much as you want. Please come. What happened? - What happened? Did somebody stab you? What happened? - Nothing. Nothing! I had a bad dream and I started screaming. I am sorry! Sorry won't do. You dream in the day, and you scream too! There are passengers in the bus with a weak heart! What if somebody had a heart attack? - Yes! Sit! Mr. Kishore. - Yes. This girl's scream has unnerved all the passengers. You are such a good singer. Please sing a song. Yes! - Yes! That song "You are so beautiful." That will come later. Now sit. I want to hear that song! "With the saunter of breeze." Listen to it in Kolkata. Sing that song! "Who is your kin here, traveller?" Bald man, sit in your place! Aradhana! - No, the other one. All of you calm down. I will sing a new song for you all. You have never heard it. Yes! But on one condition! - Yes! What? - You have to sing along with me. Agreed? Yes! Mr. Guitar. - Yes. What's your name? - Robert D'costa. Robert D'costa, please help me. - Sure! Why not? Ready! 1, 2, 3, 4! "Fragrant cold breeze, tell me." "Do you know where my beloved lives?" "The breeze smiled and said." "Note down her address." "If you want to meet your beloved then go to Goa from Bombay." "Bombay-Goa!" "Bombay-Goa!" "This is the journey of love." "Fragrant cold breeze, tell me." "Do you know where my beloved lives?" "The breeze smiled and said." "Note down her address." "If you want to meet your beloved then go to Goa from Bombay." "Bombay-Goa! Bombay-Goa!" "Bombay-Goa!" "This is the journey of love." Bus! - Bus! Stop! - Bus! Stop! We have to catch the bus! Do you think this is a bus stop that you can just stop the bus like this? - Oh god! Sir! Look, this is not a temple! It's a bus! Come on! What are you doing? Come on! Conductor! I heard a sound! Did you throw out our luggage? No! I climbed up and kept it there! So what was that sound? I fell down. That's why. Come inside. - Ok! Drive! You sit here! - Okay! Sit here! Fatso, why are you barging into the seat? Father said to. Father said to! Mister, would you teach your son to do this in the train? A bus conductor is much smarter than the train TC! Come on! Sit here! Mister, you let your son come here half naked? You should have made him wear a shirt! Why a shirt? His father is wearing one. Thank goddess you didn't wear a loin cloth for him. Mister, why are you showing your teeth? Where do you want to go? - Goa! Goa! - Yes! Do you drink liquor too? - What are you saying? We are going for our relative's wedding. Then give me Rs. 69 for 3 tickets. Oh my! Why three tickets? We are two! What about this fatso? - He too needs a ticket? His father wears a shirt for him! Will he get a free ride? He is still a small child. - He may be small for you. For me he is a fatso! Give me the money or I'll stop the bus. Uncle Conductor! - Yes, dear! Mother has the money, not father. Shut up! You tell everybody the secret! I will give you a tight slap! - Mother! No, son! Why do you beat the child? Put it back! Mother, give me the money for the ticket! I am giving it! Money! Nobody asked me for a ticket. He said to buy the child's ticket first. Why are you arguing? Our son has now grown up. Give him the money. You keep quiet! Take 3. - Take this! Here! Take this! Come on! Now honk! Now overtake this bus! Who is honking so much? Rajesh, that car driver is continuously honking!

But Kashibai I heard that there was a tiff between your daughter and your son-in-law! Last year he even sent her to her maternal house. Now he's called her back? He had to! Once I too went to my daughter's in-laws' place! And I showed them Mahakali's form. Then? My son-in-law fell at my feet immediately. He apologised and took my daughter home.

Oh god! Hen? Alive or cooked? Not cooked! She is hidden! So mister you brought the hen! I don't have a hen! I have an egg! Why are you laughing? My face has been like that since childhood! Is that so? Were you born laughing? Did your mother laugh or your father? It was a moonlit night! Showers of water all around! When I was born my mother was crying. And my father Was laughing! Mother, stop! Mister, after Sorabh Modi I think you are the second Parsi man who acts well. Thank you! - Sit! Sit! Now tell me who is hiding the hen? Rajesh! Stop the bus! Oh god! It's gone! Wow, Rajesh! What a way you stepped on the brakes! I got a betel leaf for free! Now I want to ask you all something. Where is that sound of a hen coming from? Hen! - Yes, hen! Hen! You're not allowed to bring a hen into a bus. Where is that sound from? What is in this? - Books. Hens are not allowed in the bus! Rajesh! The bus won't go ahead until the hen is found! Mr. Kader! The basket! Conductor! Her basket is moving! The basket is moving! Kashibai! Are you hiding a hen in this basket? Not a hen! It's a chick! - Is that so? Let me see the chick! Is this a chick? Bald! Kashibai, if this is a chick, would the hen be your size? Hens are not allowed in the bus! What have you done? Cruel man! Bring my hen back! Go! Hens are not allowed in the bus! And you are telling the conductor to bring it back! Rajesh, start the bus! No! Will you bring the hen or not? If you won't, I will slay everybody! Mother Kali! Don't curse us children! I have been travelling on this route for the past 10 years. But I have never seen that form of yours! Yes, mother. - Mother, forgive us! Now you understood! - Yes! Rajesh! - Khanna! Come on! Let's search for mother's hen! Pick up the basket and apologise! Apologise later! First get the hen! Yes! Let's search for that hen! I won't let that hen go! Are you beckoning a hen or a girl? Call the hen like this! Come! Catch it! Wait! I will get the hen! Come! It went away. Rajesh! - Khanna! I got hold of the head! Sit in the bus quick! Come on! Start the bus! Driver! - Here is your hen! Why are you all quiet? Why isn't anyone saying anything? You all look as if you have seen a snake! With great difficulty I got hold of this hen! What is it? Oh god! What strange people! They are afraid of a snake! A snake is so harmless! It glides, it hisses. Hold it and put it in your pocket. Do you know that in many countries people even eat snakes! Do you know how many vitamins it has? Why are you all screaming? You are Indians! Indians are not afraid of hardships! You are scared of a mere snake! Cowards! Remember, you are all Arjun's descendents! You all are Bhim's descendents! And Khana! - Run! Khanna! Bhim's descendent! Now where is your courage? Have a vitamin pill and nab it! Nab it! Why are you people so scared? This is the King of snakes! It won't harm anybody! Come, King of snakes! Give the driver a kiss! - No! Give the conductor a kiss! - Go! King of snakes! It went away! Thank god! What happened! - Nothing! My cap is at your feet. Let me put it on my head. Are you human or an animal? You always scare us! Shut up, old man! You are a coward. Always screaming! Now I am relieved! - No! Where is my hen? Mother, instead of a hen worth 5 rupees, I got you a snake worth 500 rupees. And yet you are wailing for your hen! Sinner! I curse you! - I don't drink liquor! Curse! In your next lifetime you will be a hen! And I will kill and eat you! Take this and remember what I told you! There are just 2 bullets In it. The work must be done! Got it? I will follow the bus. - Okay, boss. Listen, take care of it as soon as possible. - Boss! The bus is here! - The bus is here! The bus is here! Okay, boss. I will leave. What are you all looking at? Sit in the car. Come on! Driver! God knows what has happened to children nowadays! This is what they do if you rebuke them even a bit. What do they know what parents go through? Today the guy's family is coming to see Mala. How will we face them? Is Mr. Aatmaram at home? Come, Ramlal! Greetings, sister-in-law. - Greetings. Your son has not come? What a strange man you are! First tell us to sit! Serve us tea and water, and then ask where my son is! Do you think your son's in law's house is some hotel, for you to order for tea as soon as you arrive? Sister, will I see my daughter-in-law today? Yes. But Sister-in-law, it so happened that her friend has just returned from London after 4 years. and she took her to her house for 2 days. That's what happened in our house too. His friend has returned from America after 4 years. And he took him to Nasik for two days. What a strange coincidence! I brought his snap, if you want to see it. - Yes. Do you want to see it? Your son is very handsome! - Like father like son! Get lost! You think you are very handsome! They'll make a nice couple. Mind your leg! Madam, my legs handle me. How can I handle them? Sir, ticket to where? - Here! I am not a barber. I am a conductor! Ticket to where? The last stop! So you too are heading for the last stop. - Yes! I want to know what the destination of this unknown journey is. Poet, recite poems later. What? - No, forgive me! I meant give me 18 rupees 75 paisa. Here. Here. Sir, here is your 1.25 rupees Keep the change. Am I a waiter in a hotel? Mister, at the next stop you can have a plate of rice for 1.25 rupees. Priest, here comes your rival! He is not my rival! I consider every young girl my daughter-in-law or daughter! Daughter-in-law or daughter! That's just sour grapes! Mr. Kader, forget the grapes! I don't understand one thing. - What? As soon as the boy entered the bus, he saw the girl and he whistled. The girl got scared. He went and sat near the girl. The girl is in trouble. The guy stared at the girl. They spoke with their eyes. God knows what's going on. What can be going on? It's their youth that's to blame! "I didn't see. I didn't think." "I put my life at the target." "My desire is to die at your feet." "Swaying! Swaying!" "I will lay down my life. I will die." "I will do some great deed." "If I don't find solace even after my death." "Then where will I go, friend?" "Who is the murderer? I can't say that." "But I can't even keep quiet." "Who is the bird? Who is the hunter?" "Say something." "I left my house vowing not to leave her alone." "Spurning my life, my crazy beloved has come here." "I didn't see. I didn't think." "I put my life at the target." "My desire is to die at your feet." Did you like the song? Conductor, why are you asking her? Ask me! This is how I liked the song! You dropped me down! Driver, stop the bus! The conductor fell down! Don't worry. It's happened many times before. He will come on his own. Stop! Catch it! Mother! - Mother! No! Sister! Henceforth whatever I want to ask, I will ask you and not your daughter! Fine! Sit! When I sit, you make me stand! And when I stand, you make me sit! Conductor! Come here! I am the conductor! Treat me with respect! What happened? - I bought a ticket for Belgaum. Now I want a ticket to Goa. What's the matter? Why have you changed your mind? The journey is becoming interesting! You tell me your fare and give me a ticket to Goa! Yes, I will give you a ticket. I won't pick-pocket! Give me 12 rupees! Father! Suck your thumb! Father! Get lost! Father! Fried snacks! Fried snacks! Get lost! - Father! Fried snacks! - Shut up! Fried snacks! Why are you beating him? He is hungry! No, son! I will get you fried snacks! Fried snacks! Calm down! - Fried snacks! Fried snacks! Mister, hold his hand! - Son, stop it! What are you doing? You are gagging my son! This is the only way to stop him! No! I won't let you! Shut up! - You shut up! Such a big child wailing for fried snacks! It disgraces my position! Sit! You gag him! Don't beat the child! He is my son! Not yours! Don't touch me! I tell you, don't touch me! Here is the money. - Yes. Here is the ticket. - Sir, are you from the army? Old man, what a strange question! In that uniform, does he look like he works in a laundry? Stop this nonsense and do your work! You keep quiet! Your mouth is stinking! Sir where are you posted? - Pathankot. Pathankot! That area near Kashmir? Yes. - Sir, I heard it snows heavily there. It's very chilly there. Have you been to Kashmir before? - I am not so lucky. But I read that in books when I was a child. You read it when you were a child! And in your old age you are feeling cold! Sir is there any way to end war in the world? - What are you saying? If there is no war then why would there be guns? If there are no guns, then why would there be bullets? And if bullets are not there, then why this man and this gun? What is the need? You are a Pundit and so am I. But we think differently. I asked him whether there is any way to end wars. So why did you start screaming like a fool? - Pundit! Did you call me a fool? You're a Brahmin and you insulted a Brahmin! You have slandered not just me, but the entire community! I won't spare you! He didn't say anything wrong. He just asked for a solution to stop war. And you got angry needlessly. Being a Pundit, you are talking like a fool. You called me a fool! You are a fool! You are the biggest fool! - What did you say? You are the biggest fool in India! Your father and grandpa are fools! Your great grandpa, your ancestors were fools! - What are you saying? Leave me. Stop the bus! Stop fighting! Move aside. Shut up! Rajesh! - Khanna! This fight won't end until a third party intervenes and settles it. What do we care? Let them fight! We will play cards! - Have you brought the cards? Wow! But how will we play? I don't have money! Why are you scared? We have today's wages. Yes! This sweet lemon! - Tomatoes! I have tomatoes! We will play cards. Thank you! Move away! I will get a jack! I beg you all! - Police! Here. Khanna, why is everybody silent in the bus? Look! The policeman is taking the criminal inside the bus! Come on! Take this banana! This is your banana. - Okay, I will keep it with me. - Why fight with friends? Here is your bag! - Give it. Thank you very much, constable! Conductor! Stop the bus at the camp. I have to get down. Rajesh! Stop the bus at the camp! Goodbye! - Goodbye! Bye, conductor! We will meet again! How? Because of you there was such a quarrel inside! We met on earth. Now let's not meet in heaven. Okay! - Bye! Bye! Constable, give me money for the ticket. My wallet! It was with me when I took the bus. You thug! You are not afraid of prison too! Constable, compared to the penalty for murder, penalty for robbery is nothing! Thief, how did you steal the constable's wallet? After he got on the bus, when he raised his hands to sniff the snuff I stole his wallet. Oh my god! This penchant for snuff is very bad! In my 20 years of service, this is the first time I have been fooled. From today I will give up this habit. Wow, constable! I've always heard and seen police reform the criminal. But today for the first time I see a criminal reforming a policeman. You are right. I will throw it away. What are you doing? - I will throw it away. What are you doing? - Let go! I will throw it! What are you doing? - I will throw it away. Take the constable to the police station carefully! - What did you say? I mean, you take him carefully. Right! Madam! Thank you! - Anytime, baby! You should always be careful in life, got it? Mr. Kader, do you see that? Now they have even started whispering to each other. Pundit, I can see all of it! But we entered the bus before this tall fellow. - Yes! We have the first right! - Right. What is this? He is extending his leg as if he owns the whole bus. Get up! - Can't you see that boss is sleeping? If you disturb him, he will not spare you! - This is the limit! Every passenger has paid the fare! - Shut up! Where is the conductor? It is his duty to see to the passenger's comfort! - What will he do? Didn't you see? When the wrestler glared at him, he ran away! He's of no use anyway. Conductor! Why are you hiding your face? They are praising you! - I can't hear properly! They are saying that you a man in name only! Don't challenge me! So far you have seen men only in the wrestling ground! But this is the first time that you are seeing a man in a bus! - Show him! Show him! - Fine! Shall I? - Yes! Shall I? - Yes! Okay! - Show him! Let us see too! Boss! - Quiet! Shut up! You! - Let him sleep! Get up. Shut up! - Let him sleep, conductor! I told you boss has a fight in Goa, so he's sleeping. Fool! This is not a jumbo jet! You can't occupy three seats as if it's your father's reign. This is a bus! Get up! Oh no! Who touched me? - Boss, the conductor. Boss! The ant wants to fight with the elephant? Grumpy man, I may be an ant And you might be an elephant. But this bus doesn't belong to your father! - What did you say? Get up! - Boss! Boxer! Calm down! Sister, let go of me! You are holding my hand! Let go of me! Sister, let go of me! Boxer, you're lucky that you hit me in the bus, that's why you're spared. If you hit me outside then.. Then what would I have done? You leave! - Why? You are acting very smug! - Yes! I will break your bones! - Yes! What would you have done outside? - No! Driver! - Driver! Stop the bus! Rajesh! Stop the bus! - Yes! Okay! Careful. Come on brothers. Don't leave him! Come on brothers! - Beat him! Take off your clothes! - Okay! Strip. You called me old man! - Why would I be scared of him? Good! Take off your clothes! - Stop! I can't take off my clothes! Boxer! We will fight in Goa! What did you say? Take off his clothes! Take off your clothes! - Yes. Take off his clothes! Come on! Ask this ant how he is! - Ant! Rajesh! - Khanna! Hold this! Now I will teach him a lesson! Come on! Now. Come on! Why are you showing your chest? Look at this stomach! Go! Just go! God bless you! Ladies and Gentlemen! Now this boxer and the conductor are going to fight! I am ready to bet on him! Look at this boxer's muscles! 1.25 rupees! 1.25 rupees for 1 rupee! And his is 15 rupees for 1 rupee! This is your chance to earn money! Come on, place your bets! Where is the money? I bet 20 rupees! - On whom? The conductor? Am I mad to bet on the conductor? - Then? I'm betting on the boxer! Boxer! - Yes! Go! - 20 rupees! Go! - Anybody else? This is your chance to make some money! Look at his muscles and place your bet! Come here. - 1 rupee on the boxer! 1 rupee on the boxer!

What are you saying? Don't touch me! - Okay! Leave! - Okay! I am going! Very good! My mighty man! You won without a fight! Today I won the jackpot! How much have you made? - More than 500, see for yourself. You! Robbing my passengers by making me the scapegoat! No, no! - Get lost! Rajesh! Return everybody's money! When god is kind, even a donkey can be a wrestler. You! - Come on, everybody! Even new guys can win. Listen! - Yes! Is he dead? - No, but he has lost! Don't cry! Look, every dog has its day. - Today was your day! Look I apologise to you and to him too. Now get some water to sprinkle on his face, so he regains consciousness. From where do I get it? This is enough! Get up, boss! - Get up, boss! He's won and yet he is apologising to you, boss. Get up! You have tarnished our image! Where is Mala? - Boss, there is a problem. That scoundrel messed up my plans! - Who? A tall man with whom I got into a fight. Ravi! So he landed up here too! Yes, boss. He snatched the pistol from my hand. But boss, I came up with a ploy to make the bus break down on the way! Sit in the car, idiot! Let's go. Hey! Rajesh! Why did you stop the bus again? I didn't. The bus stopped on its own. Get down and check it. - Okay. Rajesh! - Khanna! Don't fight! Who is Rajesh? And who is Khanna? I don't know! I just know Rajesh Khanna! Khanna, where are you? What are you doing below? Come out! What is this? Do you want to go to the bathroom? No! The bus is leaking! Look! The screw of the oil tank is loose. All the oil has leaked out. Oh my god! Now what? Get a bottle of oil! Why are you joking? You want me to walk 2 miles in this scorching heat and get the oil? I can't do it! Khanna! - Yes. You can't walk, can you? - No! Then I'll get a car for you? - Yes. Why? Nowadays you flatter me a lot. If I lose my temper, I will thrash you. Get lost! I will punch you! - You! Hey! Why are you two fighting? Why are you two fighting? Stop it! Start the bus! You! Get inside! Conductor! Start the bus! Or I will file a complaint against you! Are you talking or spitting? Sister! - Move! Sister! Do you want a handkerchief? Handkerchief! "Rajesh, go to sleep!" Rajesh! First repair the oil engine. Okay. Yes. Look, Mala! - Yes. It will take the conductor time to get the diesel. Why don't we go out for some fresh air? - Okay. Come on! Hurry up! Come on! Yes, quick! Where is my wife? I am here! Come on! Come on! My cycle! What are you thinking? About the wrong decision I made in life. Meaning more ambition than courage. You left your house to become a movie star. How do you know? I know everything that goes on in the world. I even know who you are, whose daughter you are and who you're going to marry. Did you like the guy? I didn't even see him. Then look at him now. Now? Yes. Your father Mr. Aatmaram's friend Mr. Ramlal's son and your fianc Mr. Ravi Kumar. You mean you - Yes, It's me. Or would I have followed you like your bodyguard like a mad man? But why did you hide your identity from me? What could I do? You were blinded by the glitter of showbiz. I thought you would get a kick from life, and come to your senses. After all, jewellery is made after melting the gold. Forget all that. Tell me, do you like your fiancé? Even if were not my fiancé, I would have liked you. - Is that so? I think somebody is coming! - Who else? Our bus companions! Listen! Come on! "My heart belongs to you. And so do I, beloved." "I swear on you, on your threshold." "I swear on your house, oh beloved." "My love for you made me leave the world behind, beloved." "I swear on your eyes, on your tresses." "I swear on your cheeks, oh beloved." "Lovers want to create a new world." "We won't bother about anyone." "Nobody should lecture us." "We walk in a trance." "We won't step back." "My heart belongs to you. And so do I, beloved." "My love for you made me leave the world behind, beloved." What are you doing? - What? Let go of my hand! - Why? Please! Can't you understand? - What? People are watching! - Let them! They will be envy us more. - Is that so? So should I come closer? - Yes! Here I come! "No matter how much the world envies us." "Why should we fear the world?" "The ambience is so lovely." "The swaying breeze teases me." "Nobody else will ever have such a union." "Lovers will unite." "No matter how much the world tortures them." "My love for you made me leave the world behind, beloved." "I swear on your eyes, on your tresses." "I swear on your cheeks, oh beloved." "My heart belongs to you and so do I, beloved." Goats! Are you blind? You're riding your cycle over the goats! Where do I ride then? Does this road belong to your father? Does it belong to yours? You weakling, you hit me! I will thrash you black and blue! Scoundrel! You! Help! You hit me! Listen to me! Do you all mind pushing the bus to the petrol pump? Then we can go there! Do you all agree? Otherwise go to hell! - He went to sleep! Kumbhkaran! - What is it? Forget the petrol pump, we can even push it to your house. Right, brothers? Yes! Come on! - Come on! Come inside. Wife, where are you? - I am here! Wife. Harder! Push harder! Push harder! Traveling by this bus has got us into a mess. Rajesh! Rajesh! - We're tired. Rajesh, I'm back! That is Khanna's voice! Yes! That's Khanna's voice! - But where's it coming from? From here! Where else? Look up! I am here! And the oil tin is down! Look there. Why are you laughing? - You look like a monkey! Rajesh! - What? Rajesh, drivers shouldn't laugh when conductors are in trouble! Get me down! First tell me, are you hanging from there on your own accord? Or did someone put you there? Rajesh, what do I tell you? A child was taking his goats to graze. I gave him a tight slap! And the villagers hanged me on the tree! Khanna, take an oath never to raise your hand on anyone. Never! I swear on your mother, Rajesh! I will never beat anybody! Won't I come to my senses after hanging like this? Very good! Now you are talking like a decent man! Come on! - Go on. Have you repaired it? - Yes, sir! What is this? Hurry up! We don't have much time! If we lose the girl, we will all die! Got it? Come on! Hurry up! Where is my purse? - Purse? Did I leave it outside? - You didn't take it outside. Then I must have left it in the bus! Why did you leave it in the bus? You know that Conductor! Somebody stole this madam's purse! - What! Robbery in the bus! This has happened for the first time in my 10 years of service! And madam, I told you before to after your purse! Didn't I? Now we are in trouble! Pundit! Mr. Kader! If anybody found the purse, or took it by mistake, please return it. You! Get up! Where is the purse? What rubbish! Do you think I am a thief? Very good, so you know how to get angry too! I thought you just knew to comb! Sit! Conductor! - What happened? Mister, can't you be polite? Look how politely I am talking to you! I want to ask you where the passenger who was sitting here is. Mister never before did you talk to me so politely. Otherwise I am a very simple.. This man has vanished! He wanted to go to Belgaum first, and then bought a ticket for Goa. And right from the beginning he was eyeing madam's purse! But don't worry! He may be smart, but so am I. You're smarter! - Yes, smarter! But what will I do now? I I Here's an idea. Rajesh! Take a U-Turn! - What? Take the bus back towards Bombay. And I will turn the sign board! - Why? Try to understand! I am James Bond, too! Look, Bombay to Goa! Goa to Bombay! Turn the bus! - Now I understood! Move! I don't want to travel in this bus! But we want you in this bus! - But why? Come on! Give the purse! Get lost! Listen to me! - Come on! Get down! - Listen to me! - Get down! Rajesh! Change the Bombay to Goa sign board! Climb up! - Listen! Why are you beating me? You commit robbery! Conductor, listen! Please listen! "Bombay-Goa! Bombay-Goa!" "Bombay-Goa!" Look, whoever wants can have their lunch here. I will take the thief to the police station. Have your lunch. Come on! Now go to the police station! Come! Do you have lentil stew? - We have everything! Have a seat! - Meenakshi, we will get lentil stew here. Agree. I am famished! I am taking a banana! - Yes! Wow! You two look like Ram and Sita! I think you're newly weds. - Married? Why are you shy? Go to the family room! Okay, send 2 cups of tea! - Okay! My sweetheart! My darling! Darling, let's go. Come on! Let's go! - No. Its okay. You sit too, please. I am not shameless like you! Wife, Nosy parkers! Hail Bole Shankar! What will you have? Bring three plates of lunch! - Three plates of lunch! Sir, why is the child gagged? Did you take some oath? No. If you want to undo it, go ahead. - No! I mean, what will people say about the hotel if a customer is gagged? Nothing. They will only think that the hotel is very dusty. Sir, you are joking! No! You want to know the reason? I will undo it. Now watch the fun! You! Leave me! Sir, hold him! Fried snacks! Why are you looking at my face? Give him fried snacks and keep him quiet! What? - Fried snacks! Fried snacks! - Hurry up! Give him this! - Here are fried snacks! Here are fried snacks! Now you know why we gagged him? Now I understood! Not just his mouth! You should bind his eyes, hands feet, everything! I think you've pampered him too much. What could we do? We have only one child. One child like him is enough! Oh my god! I think they've all gone to the canteen. Let's go ahead and wait. - Come on! Here are your sweets! Oh my god! - Sorry! Sit here! We'll come here again - Yes! Don't worry. - Okay! Clean the tables. Come here! Where is Rajesh? He is not here. He must be eating in some private hotel. Meaning? Where besides food, girls sing and dance. "Bindi will shimmer." You guys take this car and do exactly what I said. If this time you mess up, I'll shoot you first. And Boss, don't worry. Come on! Sit! Yes. Thank you, conductor! What is this? Is this your father's bus that you stop it on the way? Don't be angry! Do me a favour! This poor man's mother is about to die in a nearby village. What? His mother is dead? She is not dead! She is sick! Okay! Come! Rajesh! Start the bus! Come on! Oh dear! Is he a man or a hippopotamus? The bullet entered my stomach! - Shut up! He fired the bullet! Yes. Now this pistol is useless! It had only two bullets. Rajesh! Stop the bus! Now this bus is not going to stop! - The bus won't stop! Come on! Nobody move! If you try to stop, I will shoot! Drive faster! Wow! Great! Thugs are abducting girls in the bus, and the men are just sitting idle! Aren't you ashamed of yourselves? Wear bangles! Wear bangles! - Nowadays men are not strong. They are eunuchs! Come on!
