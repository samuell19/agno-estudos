In answer to the question of an honorary member, I can only say ... Ah! - Newspaper, sir? - Yes thank you. Thank you. Mrs. Ransom! Where did you come from? - From above. - Mumsie, honey, are you okay? Just like rain. Halfway down, I realized it wasn’t the way out. Quite right. The stairs are much safer. - What about my eyeshadow? - Your eyeshadow! Put that on my bill. Open up! Open up! What the hell is going on there? - Where is he? - He's gone. - Gone? Who? - Nobody. Pump worker! - Wait a minute. A pump worker? - Pump worker! Bill, I would never expect you, I thought ... So who did you jump for then? A pump worker? - Bill! - And why is the door locked? - What does my picture do like this? - Oh, why are you always so jealous? I'm sorry, honey. I'm sorry. Why do I always fire the top? - Mr. Mayley? - Is his lordship waiting for you? Nobody knows, but I think they'll see me. Thank you. All right, sir ... Now, pretty calm. Excuse me. What a sight! - Look. - Huh? Va ?? polo ?? aj. Now, quite calmly ... Thank you very much. Oh, there you are, Henry. Done? - Yes. How I look? - Very "chick". - I thought the word was "chic"? - Not when it comes to you. There's a journalist who wants to see you named Dennis. A sly creature ... Shh, I could hear you. He knows ?? how sensitive journalists are. I guess I'd better take it. - Thank you, Mr. Mayley. - Thank you, sir, uh ... Mr ... - Mr. Dennis. - Good afternoon, my lord. - Good afternoon. Come in. - I see you're going to the dance. It's magnificent. Oh, hello! Very funny. Sit on the bench. Thank you. I'll be brief. - Um ... - Huh? - No ... - Oh, I'm sorry. Thank you very much. - Have a cigarette. - Thank you. - Oh, they seem to be gone. - Do not worry. - ??that's it? - One of those silent magazines. The dead truth about people's private lives. - You can borrow it. - How kind of you. I will thoroughly enjoy reading. He'll be naughty sooner, I believe. Yes ... Well, now. Let's go to work. I run a modest magazine called Naked Truth. - Pretty vulgar title, isn't it? - Maybe, but terribly capable. Here, we have a short biography of your public life and work. Very nice. On the opposite side, we have real deeds. - About me? - Yes, indeed. - And why is it called Guess Who? - Because British law says, The public must not be able to recognize you in the mischievous hero of this article. - What? I don't fully understand. - Do you have a weak heart? - No. - Then read it. Just to check the facts. You can't print this. You can't print this! - It's slander. - That's the bare truth, old sir. - But no publisher would dare. - I would. I studied the legal aspect carefully. Mr. X's love incident in Regent Park ... Psst! it has nothing to do ... with Lord Mayley's charity work. Of course, by verbally handing over the verdict, the public could connect it. You will go to jail. - I'll sue you. - Try it. We would have to prove that Mr. X was you, and thus confirm that the story is true. "Do you dare take a chance?" - This is England. - There must be a way. - There is a. Cash gift £ 10,000 for the Society of Distressed Journalists - of which I am the founder, treasurer and, so far, the only member - it will convince the editor - himself - to combat this problem. - Blackmail. It's something else. - Of course. Either way, I make money - cash or I earn royalties. It will sell like hot cakes. See how thrilled you are to read other people's secrets. - Well, that's ... - My card. Contact me in two weeks or I'll post in a month. - You ... - You don't have to kick me out. Oh, I'm sorry. My cigarettes. £ 10,000 for a quarter of an hour. Thank you. On behalf of little Sonny MacGregor, Welcome to the 167th edition of your favorite TV show - in which you all enjoy and love, Here you are now! Thank you. Now let me introduce you to the star of the show, the man who made it all possible, the faces of all faces, king of goodness, ace of good hearts ... Little Sonny MacGregor! Here for you! - This is for you, too. - Welcome, Sonny. Great big welcome to all the old people and slender young boys and vice versa. I can't see the difference, you know! I know you're going to perform this show as a real squeaky delicacy. Now, as you know, at this point, we introduce the winner of last week's talent contest. Here it is! Former Sergeant Ramble! For you, Walter boy, here's your reward, too. No, no, Walter. It's not your reward. How old did you say you were? No, that's your reward, Walter. That's it, here you go. It is. Now be a good boy, Walter. Be good! Yes, Walter, that pigskin wallet is for you, because every week, we give one of these wonderful prizes, but Walter, what's the use of a pigskin wallet if it's empty? It's not good for you, is it? - Is it? - No! That's right. So he knows ?? What am I going to do, Walter? I'll charge it. I'll fill it out of my own pocket. Look at that. Ten nice, fresh one-pound notes, all for you, Walter. Good thing I'm not married. A woman might fix that pocket! Now, Walter, did you bring it? Are you? Well, let's see, then. Where is? Oh! He brought it. He has it. His flute! Walter, what will you give us? - Malo Largo Händela. - Largo Handel! Great! All right, Walter boy, it's your turn. "Largo Handel"? Will it ?? to die laughing? Stupid old nit. I just laid out ten pounds to make ten of them guineas. - The chief accountant is here. - Make it ten pounds, then. There's a reporter, Mr. ... Dennis. He wants to see you. He left a business card. Not tonight. I'm too tired. No journalists, thank you. He is very persistent and waits. Is it? Well, good luck to him. - Son! - Little son! I'm watching you on TV. I think you're so funny, my friend. I think it's beautiful! Please, can you put "For Fred"? Of course I can put "For Fred." - God bless you, Sonny boy. - God bless you, Mom! Call me. Chelsea 1234. - Mo ?? e ?? you put "Da Mavis"? - I'm sorry, honey. Not. Mr. MacGregor? My name is Dennis. I sent you a business card. Oh yes. Sorry, I don't have time. If I mentioned a property in Eastwich, could we talk calmly? Gives. Look, he signed my name on my hand. I care more about the star who likes to wander. So true. Look, just because I have a little property ... Oh! But what real estate. I doubt that the old people who live in those slums love their boss. If they find out that Little Sonny is MacGregor ... But I ... I don't have £ 10,000. Speak ?? like a real cat, but where did the nice accent go? Yes ... What a beautiful little house. My home is a hollow barge Thames. - I can't wait to get settled. - Listen, man ... I will not pray for myself. I just want him to think ?? to those thousands of old men, the poor, the old without friends. Look, they look at me as their leader and comforter. That's right. I'll think for them, and you're gonna keep an eye on 10,000, huh? Don’t bother consulting your lawyers. I consulted three. They all say it's safe. Make up your mind. Pay in two weeks or post through the month. Don't bother kicking me out. - Don't bite your nails. - Ah, shut up. Watch your behavior. Well, you got in real trouble. - You listened again. - I'm just trying to help. Come on. Say. Say. - I'm fired again, aren't I? - Yes! We can both start looking for another term. This is the end of Little Sonny MacGregor. Don't bite your nails. Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, pray for that wizard of perfect crime, D Mandeville. Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, contrary to popular rumors, I'm a woman. The fact that I write about investigation, crime and sudden death and I prefer to carry the title of D Mandeville instead of my name Desiree Minsch she is probably responsible for this misconception. We gathered here for the award ceremony annual Purity Literature Awards . Flora is read by the highest and the lowest, the youngest and oldest in the country. Never before has this prestigious award been more deservedly won. Hey, hey! In addition to winning this award, Flora herself also won and will soon accept the church. Good old Batty's dad. Flora, come and get her. Ladies and gentlemen, I do not deserve this. All I can say is ... this is the happiest ... the happiest ... Flora! - I admit I'm very upset. - So am I, Daddy Batty. She has something in mind. I haven't worked in a nursing home all these years that I don't know when someone is ... well, on the edge. Prilièno. Prilièno. - What were you talking about? - Nothing, my dear. I just said the window should have a railing. I don't want any questions. It was an accident. Oh, yes, yes, yes! I'm sure they wouldn't try to commit suicide more than they would think ... - Murder? - Exactly. That. I hope no one suspects me of that. Ethel, is that old box still ?? always in the attic? I think so, Mumsie. Because? Did you mean to leave? No ... but someone else might. They can post and get away, eh? Oh. Good idea?! That is absolutely scandalous! You lawyers should be shot. No, of course, I was not blackmailed. It's just that I ... It's ... Oh, hell! Halo? Is that Sister Hopkins? Lord Mayley here. I called to ask about my wife’s father. Yesterday, it was terrible ... Are you sitting? Exceptional. Oh! Probably good enough to sign ... I mean, read and write. Is it? Oh, good. Well, pass on my regards to him. Ah, who was that? My broker. Lucy, I just needed advice for some stocks. He thinks?? can your father lend me some money? I am absolutely sure ... not to. Vraga! Great. What part of Birmingham does it come from ??, Fred? I don't come from Birmingham. I come from London. He's a stranger! - Great. What part of London? - Eastwich. - Eastwich? - Yes. I don't want to see him again. Ok then. Fine. - It's hell on earth. - Mo ?? e ?? take Eastwich. - Shut up. - I just don't like it. - Shut up about it! - I just expressed my opinion! - Shut up about Eastwich! - Cut it out! Cut it out! - Shut up! 'Mr MacGregor? This is National News ... ' You have to do something with yourself. In that case, you will end up without Mr. Dennis. What can I do? I really do not know. Push him under the bus. This is a way to get rid of such pests. It’s just some kind of stupid remark. Me, who wouldn't even step on an ant. Which would not ... I couldn't ... but someone else can. - Who? - Anyone. Any of the thousand characters I can create, and then destroy, just like that. - What's going on around, Mr. M? - Murder, Potter. Murder. Murder by unknown persons or persons, someone who doesn't exist at all, cheating, murder is a fabrication of my imagination. Oh, no. No, he can't ??. He could never get out. I can laugh and kill myself while I laugh. Oh, for God's sake. I will drown more sailors than mermaids. - That trouble is Old Vic, sir. - I'll play a speaker like Nestor, to cheat more cunningly than Ulysses and like Sinon, busy yet ?? Troy! What did he mean by skiing around his boat? Mr. M, television is one thing, but reality is something else entirely. - You should just go and overdo it. - Why should I? - Because you always do. - Lovely. Honestly, you always act ?? mostly scared. - Will he send? What did you say? - All right, fire me again ... but get this crazy idea out of your head. Too late, my friend. A dice have been rolled. - Who is that? - Mrs. Right. Well, this is an unexpected pleasure. Come in. It's wiser on the phone. Please have a seat. Do you want something to drink? I hope this is not a plea for my better nature. - I have not. - No. You may already know, My engagement has failed. I'll never see Bill, so it's not good that you're still blackmailing me because I have no money in the world. This is shocking news. But 16 Texas oil wells should not be discarded. It doesn't matter. They wouldn't understand. I really love him, and without him I'm nobody, so please please leave me alone. Sorry, would that make her ?? has always been a good supporting feature. "With the eerie past, the unfortunate Texan oil model is losing millions." Look, my dear. It would be better to try to get it back but spend your time and mine. to d...?! - Excuse me, sir. - What are you doing? here? I apologize, sir, for the intrusion. - Get out of here! - I'm trying, sir. All right, I'll try to do it ??. Wait a minute here. MacGregor... When the hell are you doing ??? - Do you want to know who I am? - Yes, I do. Well, sir, you see, I'm from the London Bureau of Vessels, Barges, Sailboats, catamarans and maintenance, sir ... that's it. Maintenance? This place is damned. I'm the last. You're in luck. If the wet is rotten ?? on top, do you have dry rot ?? at the bottom. - What are you talking about? - I'll show you. Look. - to...? - Oh! I'll see what I can do. I'll put it in my report ... and I'll try to get them before they close. I don't have a plug with me, so I'll be back later ... Terrible thing, over there. Strange thing, yes. A terrible mess over there, a terrible mess. - Gentlemen? - Some soothing drops, please. - Some...? - Calming drops. - Do you want to cross me? - If I wanted to, I'd say so. But quite the opposite. Calming drops. You must have heard of them? - To calm down? - People. Who else? - You mean sleeping drops. - I guess so, but for now. My dear lady, you are asking about Mickey Finn. - Is it? - We have a mild sedative, if you sleep badly. I sleep perfectly well, thank you. Mickey Finn ... Mickey ... Thank you very much. Desiree, you're a criminal expert, how do you get one Mickey Finn? Well, I get all the drops from a little thief called Maury Fish. He hangs out all the time in a pub called Limehouse Arms. At Limehouse Arms? Thank you very much. - Yes? - Gin i ... Porto and lemon, please. - Thank you. - One and six. - You know Maury Fish? - Why? I need something from Mickey Finn. Real McCoy, mac. - What do you want? - Don't ask questions, eh? Wait here. Hello. Okay veèer, deèki. - Do you have things? - What things? - Mickey Finca. - Do you like it? - Don't ask questions, eh? - I'm afraid it's our duty, ma'am. We're policemen. Come with us. My dear Lord Mayley! This is an unexpected pleasure. About the good news, I believe? - Yes and no. - Ah ... Hmm ... I'm willing to pay but the point is - my wife's rich father is in his final stages. - So? - It won't take a year. She'll get a lot, I'll be able to get something out. Year? I gave you two weeks, remember? - Yes, but £ 10,000 ... - You're the head of security. - You make a lot of money. - My wife spends a lot. - If there's anything left, I'll spend it. - Aunt. I don't know where I'll get £ 10,000. - He can do it. I trust you. - You ... - You what? - You all ... her! - Help! Help! - Hold on! Don't panic! Don't panic ?! I can't swim! Help! Help! Who the hell are you doing ?? here? All day service. I reported a data leak. - Are you OK? - Yes. Take him home. He is my esteemed friend. - I understand, sir. - At home for a hot drink. We don't want you to get pneumonia. Good night. Good night, sir. Come, my dear. Don't call me darling! I'm sorry. I should have thanked you for saving my life. Half a crown? It's not worth it. I would do it for less. Your mustache ... Oh, yes, sir. I have disgusting baldness, sir. She crawled all over my lips, yes, sir. Yes sir. - Find Mrs. Ransom. - Yes sir. I’m sure Mrs. Ransom is looking for local themes for one of her novels. The local theme is one thing. The question of the law for Mickey Finn is another. - I don't know Mr. Finn. - Calming drops, sir. Drugs. Oh, my God! Then the abuse of a police officer , and giving a false name. - "Lotus flower." - God be merciful. - She drank. - Oh, never. No, Mumsie is a complete anti-alcoholic. She was at the port and the lemon tonight, miss. Well, I'm sure she was very sorry . She was stressed ... I will write to my messenger! You didn't hear the rest, not in the long run! - Flora! - Sit down. Disguised as a civilian. That shit that arrested me didn't even shave! Madam, no one has arrested you. Now please go home. If you want to know anything about crime, ask the police. Ok then. Where would I get Mickey Finn? I have no idea. Eto, vidi ??? Stupid, Cedric. ?? to èekate? Stupid. Ethel, numb! Sergeant, where can I get Mickey Finn? I have no idea, sir. Good veèer. Must?? do you keep popping up? Looks like you jumped in. What about ...? - I ... I got stuck in a storm. - It wasn't raining. It was raining where I was. Like from a cable. - And mud, I see. - Yes, I have to brush it. By the way, one of your girls called. Really? Which? I mean ... what does he mean ??? She had a shrill voice and refused to give her name. - Never heard of her. - Will ??. She's in trouble. Impossible. It must be a mistake. The bomb ... Yes, the bomb will do it. The bomb will carry him and his records and the barge for the kingdom will come, but it would not hurt anyone else. That. But where do we get the bomb? Well, if you want ?? only one little one should go to Ireland. Sincerely! A bomb, in fact. Get that crazy idea out of your head. Ireland ... That's it! Ireland! Remember ?? is that old villain, from the play Dublin. He's still ?? always in it. Give me a stalk of that thing they're carrying in a pack. ??that's it? - Walking stick. - No, clover, you fool. And book me my first plane to Dublin in the morning, will you? Henry? Henry? Please don't ask me any more questions about that storm. The orphan from the storm had just arrived. - What? - Your girlfriend. Look, I keep telling you, I don't have a girlfriend. - How does it look like? - Oh, about 40 years. I thought you said she was a girl. - I didn't mean her age. - E? Oh. Poor Henry. It never rains on the left, huh? I've never seen her before. That's a lie. - What? - Whatever he says I did. - Wouldn't you go and find out? - Yes, I certainly would. And be careful. Mo ?? e ?? fall. - Good evening. Did you need me? - I'm sorry to break in like this. I know you did something terrible, too, but you don't have to pay anything. - What is he talking about ??? - That beastly Dennis. Come here, will you ?? li? ... and there were magazines about Sonny MacGregor and a lady named Rans. Now I have nothing to lose, I will discover everything. - To whom? - To the police. You may have nothing to lose, but other people have. - Ne ?? eli ?? pay him, right? - I have to think about my reputation. I can't talk to you about it here. That is the most embarrassing. I'll come to you tomorrow ... I can not. I have a board meeting and a charity dance. I'll come the day after tomorrow. Until then, don't reveal anything. - Where do you live, by the way? - Chillingdon Court 54. You know that? Yes, I had ... The day after tomorrow. - Ah, ah. This way. The company will ... - The company ?! Yes, the company will try to unravel things. - We'll try to find the man. - Dennis? But I know ... Don't do anything until I answer. 12:30, the day after tomorrow. Yuck! 54... 54... Honey ... Shall I write this down for you? Born! Can a drop of particles, please. Right away. - Three and six, please. - Yes, yes, good ... - Here. - Thank you. God bless everyone here. My name is Lannegan. I'm from the other shore. You're going to be O'Toole, aren't you? I 'm glad to meet you. I am a descendant of the kings of the courts of Tara. It is so. We do business in London. This is Albert Hall after all, and we've run out of jelly. So if you let me get some explosives, I'll do the job. But why do we speak a damn language, when we have Gaelic? Oh... Llanfairpwllgwyngyll... boilermakers at ... Ilantysiliogogogoch. He's English, all right. Oh! My nose. My nose is gone! F... F- A... F-... F- A-R... F- I... Fist... Fistula... Flat... Ethel, kako is pi ?? e Finn? - What? Suspicious fine? - No, Mickey Finn. Oh, Mumsie. You and that Mickey Finn. I won't have peace until I get one from the nursing home. What did you say? Doctors use it on violent patients. Why didn't you say? Why didn't I think of that? - Get me something. Enough of them. - Mumsie, I was just kidding. Wait! Sit down. Ethel, I have something very important to tell you . He knows ?? as much as my reputation as a writer and as women means. You are loved and respected by the whole world, Mumsie. So far, yes. Ethel, many years ago, your father was in China. He ran out of money. I was young, beautiful. It was easy, and so it was ... And so I fell off. So, you slipped, baby. Like most people. You got back on your feet. In a few months, I completely lost my mind. Ethel, I guess someone found out and threatens to expose me to the world. What would you say? I ... I'd like to kill him, Mumsie. Great. That's exactly what we're going to do. - Mumsie! - I worked it all out. - I sank his barge. - She sank his barge ?! No, she searched. He lives in a beautiful place. - But, Mumsie ... - Shh! Halo? Are you that Dennis? This is Flora Ransom. I have you ?? money. Come pick him up at 7:30 tomorrow night. Now, get the pills, I'll prepare the crate. "Zalemi ?? icu u rupu denoted by Z." And that's it. - Great. - ??that's it? That, my friend, is a complete bomb. Now gunpowder. My colonel of the Indian army is leaving with too much uniform. Mr. MacGregor? My name is Lord Mayley. - Yes? - We haven't met but they said you were of a very decent kind. - Very kind of you. - I'm sure you agree how we should help each other. - How much do you want ??? - No, I want to help. Mr. MacGregor, if I mentioned Dennis' name, and to know how you are "U" - neither ... - "U" - an? - Well, blackmailed. - Look, can I come in? - Little Sonny MacGregor blackmailed? - I think you were wrong. - You wonder why I'm here. I know why you're here, my friend. You are also "U" - neither. - No, I'm completely unimportant. - I wouldn't say that. Please explain. A young lady came to visit me ... You are a happy man. Good luck, sir, and have a nice day. - Mr. MacGregor? - Go away. You will regret it. - How did he find out? - I do not know. Why didn't you let him talk? He obviously wanted an ally. The more friends we have now ... Make an ally of that idiot? No Thanks. I will rely on my bomb. And now ... for gunpowder. Bill! Oh, Bill! Du ?? o! Oh, no! We don't want anything today. - You don't want that? - I don't know who you are. - Go away! - Of course he knows? who am i - I do not know! - But you called me here! Didn't you forget last night? You got me out of bed! Well, didn't you? Ne, Bill. Born! Bill! Please don't, Bill! Bill, please! Not! Please ... Bill! Please come here! Good. Good. I'll leave him alone, and I'll tell you why. Were done! Done! Finished! Understands ??? Good day sir. Good afternoon. I have a shooting day and I need some bullets. Cartridge? Of course, sir. Some specific ones? No, as long as they contain gunpowder. - What time is it? - For works? No no. Something like rabbits, pheasants, small game, you know. No, no, sir. Saèma. SA-È-MA. Saèma! - Hmm? - 12, 20 or 4-10? Well ... Definitely, yes. So which one, sir? Well, the biggest you have, for sure. Twelve. How much, sir? 50? No, I think it's best to be a thousand. - A thousand ?! - Yes. But didn’t you say daily chase? Yeah, I did, eh ... and that could be pretty big. Come to think of it, I think 1500 would be better, maybe ? That's right. There's whiskey, gin, sherry, tea, coffee, cocoa - all Mickey Finn. He will have to accept one or the other. Mumsie. Oh, Mumsie! This is an obvious murder! Remember, before you can fuck him, you have to ?? take his keys. But why should I do all the dirty work? He would never take a drink from me. He would surely doubt it! - I'll hang myself! - He'll say "hang", and he won't. Oh, Mumsie! I'll go up the service stairs to avoid him. Is everything clear? Good. I'll be in the car in front. The moment it becomes insensitive, give a signal from the window. - Will he have ?? a lot to answer. - Mumsie! - Not yet? long. Chin up. Chin up ... Oh! It's ... Mumsie, she ... Oh... Oh. Mrs. ... Mrs. Ransom? Are you alone? Can I come in? armantno. armantno. - Are you leaving? - No no. Yes, Mrs. Ransom ... Hello. I'm sorry. Mrs. Ransom, if I mentioned the name "Dennis" and the word "blackmail," could that mean anything to you? That? Super. What I want to know is if you intend to pay him, or will you fight? I do not know. Do you want medicine ...? Mick ...? Drinks? - Yes, I think so. - Please. t... t... - What would you like? - Anything, thanks. Except for the tomato juice, of course. You know, Mrs. Ransom, that's a great relief to me. First I would like to present ... Wow! Wait a minute. You will knock me unconscious. Can I have some soda, please? Thank you. In your good health. Mmm! I needed that. Well, Mrs. Ransom, we now come to a really delicate matter. If the announcement is a real threat , we ... Ka ?? em ... Oh, darling. What, already inside? Bravo! Well done. The keys? - Let's go together. Best forward. - Oh, Mumsie. Not. We can't leave him there. He will suffocate before we drown him. No, it must look like suicide or an accident. One, two, three ... Come on! Thats how you do it. - Good evening, Mrs. Ransom. - Officer Johnson, help us. - Is someone leaving? - Yes. - What's here? Body? - Yes! How did you guess? - My daughter killed him. - Poisoned or suffocated? - Both, I'm scared. - Very strange. - Why did you do that? - He blackmailed Mumsie ... - Ethel! Good night, Officer. - Good night. After he's in the pond, we'll go to the beautiful and destroy the contents of the cabinet. - We can't do this without killing him? - Of course not. He would just hide and write all over again. Of course, we have to kill him. Wow! Slowly. We must not hurt him. Stupid, Ethel. Pomozi mi. Come on! We'll get him out of here. Come on, Ethel. Good. Mountain. So! Let him pull. Come on. Damn it! He's stuck. Should?? it run! Come on, Ethel! Psst! Will he wake up ?? him! Psst! Hurry up, girl. Po ?? uri! That's right, shut the box. Come here. - He looked so happy. So happy! - Great. Then everyone is. The last round. Barge. Come on. Draga ... What time is it, darling? Help! Help! Where am I! My God! Where am I? - Stupid jerk. He didn't lock it. - Don't talk bad about the dead. Come on. It's here. Come on. Carefully. That's it. Come on. Pick it up. Carefully. Rasut æe ?? him on all sides. Come on! Got it ?? is that the contents of this cabinet could swing London to the ground? And provide a very interesting read, moreover! Oh, Henry? - Oh, my heart! - Yes, that's a problem. Jo ?? one storm? No ... Algae. That's it. That's it. Yes, I ... I got a little wet. - Midnight bath. - Fully dressed? Well, I couldn't get in naked, could I? Well, right? - I broke in. - Well, get in bed. - I'll call a doctor. - I'm going out again. Where at this time? Serpentine? Have Maria bring out your diving suit. Go and clean up. Looks like ?? scary. Oh, good evening. Is Mrs. Ransom here? Yes, but I'm afraid he can't see anyone now. Then I'll wait. Please, could we come back tomorrow? Mumsie ... Mumsie won't be the least bit surprised to see me. - It would be better tonight. Can I? - Yes, of course ... No! - That's bad! It's gone! Flies! - All right, all right! It's Mumsie. Good veèer. Well, he doesn't look so surprised. You were expecting me earlier, or have other obligations gotten out of mind? No, no, no ... Of course I was expecting you. - Would you like something to drink? - No Thanks. - Your daughter warned me. - Is it? Ethel, come here. I'm sorry. Certainly. Oh. How did he escape? - Who? - Dennis, girl. Dennis! - It's not Dennis, Mumsie. - Of course it's Dennis. - I should know. - Well, it can't be. Then who is the man in the trunk? Oh, Mumsie, to si uèinila? What did I do ?! You killed an innocent bystander. Refrain. - Take it back to the barge. - Why? If he misses it, he'll be suspicious. Besides, it's pointless to take that while he's alive. If I pull it now, we can bring it back. I mean, why did you have to go and warn him ... Po ?? uri! Po ?? uri! Our whole future depends on it. Forgive me. I was getting rid of my daughter. Getting rid of people seems like yours ?? hobby. Eh?! Are you sure you won't have a drink? Oh, no. Still, I don't think so. - Oh ... - Please sit down. Work before pleasure. Kljuèevi! Good evening, Officer. Nice evening. Mr. X was then pushed into the pond. I don't know why you did that, but if it's not worth twice what I asked for, I'm Dutch. That was silly. We ... I was working on a plot. Forging a conspiracy, don't you think? ?? to bi va ?? friend said? Therefore, I propose a contract which makes up more than 50 percent of all future royalties forever. - Impossible. - Then I'll send an anonymous letter, telling the police to search the pond and name you the culprit. - Mumsie! Mumsie! - Go away! But, Mumsie, the keys! Have?? keys! In my raincoat pocket. Po ?? uri. Don't say someone else is up for the high jump. What about the money you mentioned? I can't get it. It could be a few days. Well, the New Deal will be £ 5,000 less up front with 50 per cent. When can I hope to see the money and the contract? Knowing...! My agent is gone. Come the day after tomorrow night at nine o'clock. Well, don't disappoint me this time. - No. - Good. Good night, Officer. Good night. Excuse me, sir, you have ... Oh! Oh! You. G. Advanced baldness. No, they won't ??! There is something suspicious here. There will be something else soon. more suspicious, sir. We'll stay here and discuss it very quietly. "A mysterious explosion smashed a car"! So, Henry? What's going on? Come on. Out with that. I am impatient. If it's not the police or the press, then it's you. Just a few minor accidents and I'll never see the girl again. Mrs. Melissa Right needs to see you urgently, sir. So let's go again. Bring her in, Maria. Introduce her now. Bathing again, or is this a dry day? Good morning my dear. Ba ?? It is very nice to see you again. My husband was afraid we wouldn't see you again. I have a feeling you won't need the fins of a diving suit today. - You shouldn't have come here. - It's me... Psst! I came to apologize for yesterday. That's the only reason you came? No it's not. Now I really lost Bill. - I'm going to the police. - Please ... That's not good. No sense in crying over spilled milk. You don't understand. I don't care about his money. I really love him. So now I'm putting my own back on that mean Dennis. Just a moment. You said you saw a document about that author Flori Ransom? - Yes. - Good! Let's see her. I have a few questions to ask that murderous woman. I'm sorry. - Have a good time. - I'm not having a good time! Is Mrs. Ransom here? He's out, but we expect him back soon. Come in. Thank you. My name is Bastable. I'm the lucky guy she agreed to marry. She's a widow, you know. This way. Oh, Flora is expecting you? - I think so? and not. - Oh. Let me introduce myself. My name is Mayley, Lord Mayley, and that is Mrs. Rights. Oh, èestitam! No no. That's her name. Her name? Oh, how are you? Gives... Would you like a glass of sherry while you wait? Yes please. So, Mrs. Ransom has been a widow for a long time? Oh yes. Many years. Yes. Many, many, years. Hers is he poor ?? died in the East under very mysterious circumstances. - Oh? - Yes. He drowned, poor thing. - Oh! - Flora was in England then. Oh. Ah! It could be her. She's ... She happens to forget the keys. Let me speak. Good morning sir. Mrs. Ransom? She's out, but we expect her to come back if you'd like to come in. Well, I did, sir, didn't I? - Don't worry, sir. - Oh, I'm sure he doesn't care. I'm investigating the disappearance of a locker last seen in her possession. - I don't know if you know what? - I have no idea. Now, please ... - Well, you won't come in? - Yes thank you. This is Lord ...? - How are you? - And this is Mrs., um ...? That's the smartest gentleman in the police force. - I'm glad. - Would you like a glass of sherry? Well, I shouldn't be on duty, if you'll excuse ... a word ... but a small one for medicinal purposes. - Great. - Yes. Well, for what we get ... Oh, Mumsie, are we going to have to flee the country? If we could justify that ... Killing a stranger by mistake? Go and finish that crate. How can you use that of all the crates? - What is it now? - It's ... It's Daddy Batty. He will come! Get rid of him. Let's go on vacation, remember ?? what? Well, let me in. He seemed ... Well, he was ... - ??English. - ??English?! Cedric! Why, you cheeky girl! - God. They fell asleep! - Mumsie, look! Sergeant ... The police found out! They drugged themselves. We jo ?? we can get it out. - Mumsie, look! His mustache! - They're fine with us. He is an ordinary bully disguised as an ordinary policeman. We have to get on the earlier plane. Keep watch while I finish packing. - Why is this? - Like a crown to him if he wakes up. - No! - The one who holds the loitra alone is equally guilty. Not! Not! Jo ?? one?! Who's he? - That's him! - He? - That's him! It can't be, but it is! - Which one? Which we drowned! - He's back! - Ethel, stop it! Are you sure? Returned from the dead and more ?? always so happy! Cut it out! Refrain! Here. Drink this. Here. Mumsie ... - You ... - No! - Vi! - No, Ethel! Ethel! Oh! Ohh! ... I have a deadline tomorrow. I'm sorry. What a set. Oh, am I interrupting something? Yes, Cedric. We are getting rid of the complication. That's interesting. It's dark already. - It seems to me that ... - Fall off? Yes, Cedric. - Ethel will get you a cab. - Taxi? Oh, thank you very much. Before I fell, didn't you have a mustache, Sergeant? Yes, Cedric. They also fell off. Don't be a fool. Well, good luck with your efforts. Thank you. We'll need it. Oh, darling. Oh... - Now, where were we? - My plan. I'll finish it but I'll need an alibi from you. Just a second. I oppose violence. This is handy after hours of talking. I never said I would do anything. I find the murder fairly non-English. Someone has to draw a line somewhere. What is your alternative? Police? Come on. I don't mind. I've never worked like you, not even on television. Look, Dennis is coming here at nine tomorrow night. I can go to the beautiful. See you at eight. Get a cassette player. - Thank you very much. - Henry? It is a pleasure to meet you, Mr. MacGregor. I'm a fan. Does he give you my husband ?? some funny ideas? - Well, some ideas. - If you could just say, things that happen to him in his private life! Mr. MacGregor and I have insurance issues to discuss. - We must not be bothered. - Really! That's right. Sit down. Now, have you written any assurance dialogue? - Here you go. - Good. By the way, one day, I could really get into politics with you. Wouldn't insure your ?? Life to the smallest detail ... or mine. - Ready? - Uh-huh. "Here are the numbers, MacGregor. Look." "I get it all with such a small premium?" 'Here are the numbers, MacGregor. Look. ' "I get it all with such a small premium?" - That disgusting little man again. - He saved your poor life. Half a crown! Ha! "I get it all with such a small premium?" We better record 15 minutes of that worth. - How long do you think you'll be? - Depends on when he goes to sleep but I hope he'll be done by midnight. 'The personal risk clause interests me. ' 'Here are the numbers, MacGregor. Look. ' "I get it all with such a small premium?" Sorry I'm late, love. Mother will continue like this. We can say that we spent on ?? vacation cruising. Yes, cabin class. Come on, we'll be late. - Ne ?? eli ?? it! Come on. - Oh, all right. ?? what the hell is he doing ?? here? Good morning sir. I was looking for you, sir, for your up and down. No need. I left the boat to a young couple. I understand so much, sir. That. That. Oh, just in case. Where did you get removed? On village. When you're here, can you? help carry my luggage in the car. - Ja ka ?? em! G. Dennis? - Gives. I'm a cop. Who are you? Um, I'm from the Barge, Beautiful, West London Ships ... Odzuji. Mr. Dennis, I have a warrant for your arrest based on asking for money with threats from Wilfred Aintree. Whatever you say can be used as evidence. I won't say anything, but if I have to fall, I'll lift them into the sky ... - Oh. All right, let's go. - First here, please. You won't find much here. 'The personal risk clause interests me. "Let's say a terrible catastrophe happens to me ?" 'Here are the numbers, MacGregor. Look. ' "I get it all with such a small premium?" - Oh, good morning, Lady Mayley. - Good morning. Good morning, yes. Um ... I, uh ... - Yes? - Well, I, uh ... I'm sorry to bother you at this time, but is it yours? him?? here? Not everyone is there, I think. We're sorry. - Henry? - to? Do you and Mr. MacGregor want breakfast? - Just a moment. I'll ask him. - No, I'll ask him. He is here with me. You know, I'm back to clean up one little thing. Are you saying I really got it all with such a small premium? I'm sorry. Dr. Wilson. Dr. Wilson... Dr. Wilson... Nigel! I can not believe it. In Virginia. I can not believe it. Mario. I believe that. I say. You were a little kid, were n't you? All lies. I'm glad you got the file. What benefit? He will not forget our names. To heaven, he said. "I will lift you all to heaven." I hoæe, gad. - So we're sinking. - If he speaks. We can also be tied to a sheep like a lamb. - MacGregor? - Ha? Dennis must not be brought to justice. So, it goes ?? break into jail and kill him? But break into the jail and get him out. - What ?! - He must be saved at all costs and derived from the earth. Are you crazy ?! We killed ourselves trying to kill him. And you failed. Now I'm taking over the job. Call the defendant Ransom. Come on. - We'll never get away with it. - We wouldn't ... but we have here hundreds of allies from all walks of life. Look. Pilots, shipowners, doctors, politicians. Everyone you might need. - Why? - For the greatest escape in history. - Call the phone! - Yes ... Yes, let the police spin in a circle. Hundreds of loyal allies united in a common cause. God! Sir Hatton Aysbrook. He is on my board of directors. He will have to leave. We can't hire such disgusting people. - Come on! Call the phone! - Yes Yes. Brickwell, bring the prisoner. He called - they use Wolseley! Toèno, doði! Help! Police! I'm under attack! È- È-four men. Third floor, Stretton Street 14, WC2. Stretton Street 14, WC2. Regards, 70g. Hello, 70g for George. 'Attacked Woman, Stretton Street 14.' Greeting. 70g for George. Received a message. Done. Help! Police! Odeon Cinema! Police! Quickly! Fight the gang! Help! He will kill me! Lucas Square 10, SW7. Hello, 7 for an apple. Frobisher Street, gang fight. Help! Help! He's breaking in! Where is he? Where is he? Oh, honey, I'll explain later. I'm so glad to see you. Regards, 15B, 15B. Bremnitt district, the maniac is at large. - Dennis' trial is set to begin today. - Good! ?? Is that it? Slet? I say, my old man. Your tire is flat. Aha! It's a nice day for a trial. Nice day for almost nothing, Mr. Dennis. - What? You?! - For your own good. So your tire is flat. Well, fix it! No, you can't have a replacement car. We are too busy. - Is everything okay, Doctor? - Yes, and thank you. Is she waiting for us ?? a long way. Bravo! Well done, indeed. Open the door, Doctor. - I really believe we did it. - I'm worried about the last lap. I'm sorry. It's for your own good. Oh, good. Whatever it is, it's over. A prisoner abducted on the way to Old Bailey. I bet for sure that's it ?? one deception. I always wanted to go in a helicopter, Commander. The most exciting. The last lap will probably be more ?? more exciting. Probably the death of us all. It's for your own good, man. - Well, the last lap, but one. - Don't mention that last round. I don't know what worries you. Admiral Kinley says he had a leak in the last 15 years. Even so, 200 km out into the Atlantic in such a fragile vessel. - We should have taken the plane. - How could we pass it on? It's for your own good. He is asleep again. How do we stand? - We're half an hour late. - We'll be in Skylark in two hours. Brave, skipper. That won't ?? long. I always knew I would hate this thing. You know, I've said a lot of rude things about you in the past, Henry, but I have to give you credit, this was a magnificent organization. Thank you, Sonny. I really like it ?? on television. Consciousness is coming. All is well. We won't hurt you. - Where am I? - 200 miles in the Atlantic. We'll move you soon on a ship connection to South America and security. - Why? - Why? Because of your threat to ?? expose everything, we decided to save you ... - under the conditions. - What are the terms? Never again ?? to re-enter England or try to blackmail their victims. Three hundred people worked on your escape. If only more ?? once he springs, he'll get you 300 times. You did all this to prevent the worst scandal ever since Lady Godiva went horseback riding. But I didn't want to talk. I had a very good chance of getting out. Yes, and if my defense attorney was right, you destroyed most of the evidence when you took that locker. So, you're up to it. If you don't mind, I feel a little pale. I think I'll get some fresh air. Fool! Why on earth did he do that? He's probably a very good swimmer. Anyway, what do we care? Yippee!
