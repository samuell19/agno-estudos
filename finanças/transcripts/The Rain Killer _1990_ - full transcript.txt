(dramatic synthesizer music) (thunder cracks) - The gruesome murder of a Brentwood woman whose body was discovered early this morning near her home, the victim has been identified as 41 year old Margaret Warren. Police are withholding most details, but Power News has learned the victim was stabbed and mutilated. Turning now to the weather, a series of Pacific storms continues to roll into the southland. (thunder cracks) (dramatic music) - [Announcer] The San Diegan to Floritan, Santa Ana, Anaheim, and San Diego, now leaving on track seven. (train whistle blows) (dramatic music) - All aboard! (dramatic music) - Oh, cutting it a little too close. (screams) (dramatic music) (woman whimpers) - Oh my God. Get the cops on the horn, fast! - Police officer, nobody gets off, hey, hey, come on, get your pinstripe asses back on the train and don't fuck with me. Get a team together and get a list of everybody who got off the train, come on. - Lieutenant. - Yeah. - Capra. - Yeah. - How do you want to play this? - What do I know, there was a fucking train. Detective Capra, police. Shit. (man coughs) Every detail from the top. - I found her just like that, checked back here just before we left Union Station, that's all I know. (man sighs) - Anybody in here see someone go through here? - It could only happen on one of the older cars. The new ones are laid out all different. You think he knew that? - I don't know, it's possible. - The guy with the sunglasses. - You describe him for us sir? - Overcoat, hat. (man coughs) Sunglasses with reflective lenses. He seemed out of place. - Anybody else see this guy, huh? (man groans) - Here you go, cap. - Shit. - We gonna write this up or what? - What's it look like? - Well. - Okay. - You want to talk about it? (man sighs) - Reese, old buddy, piss off. - Pissing. (bangs on doors) (Capra groans) - Captain Hacket, step into my office. (man sighs) - A woman gets ripped on a train, there tend to be a few questions. - I'm really not up for this. - Elizabeth Collinger, senior editor, Christ. Somebody prominent. - I'm a fucking lifeguard in a slaughterhouse, man. - What have you got? - A big zero, trainload of people, nobody saw anything, the lab? - They found a plastic raincoat on the tracks, sold all over town. He used it like a butcher's apron, it's untraceable. No weapon, looks like we got ourselves a real smart psycho and look at you. - I need some R&R, Lee. (laughs) - There's more, the ME says the wounds are identical to a murder in Brentwood day before yesterday. - Don't tell me that. - I need you on your feet. My office, eight AM. Sober. - [Hacket] There are much easier places to kill somebody. He took a big risk, why? - Showing off. - [Hacket] Okay, I'll buy that. - [Reese] Brentwood murder didn't get much airplay. Maybe he was trying to do something spectacular. - He wants our attention, he's got it. - So what do we do now? - Round up the usual perverts. - To start with, he may have a pattern. Look for a link between the victims. - No connection except they were all well to do women of about the same age. - And the rain. - What about it? - When they were both killed, it was raining. (dramatic music) (horn honks) (eerie music) - There's something wrong with, oh! (woman screams) (dramatic music) Oh, somebody help me, oh! No! (light synthesizer music) - How's it going, Roden, they check your ID before you came in here? Eh, what are you gonna do about a city that gets its annual rainfall in just two weeks, eh? New York, Boston, Chicago, those are real cities, Lee. - Is this the Wild Turkey talking? - Oh, you'd rather talk about how silly we look on this thing, huh? - Look, this guy is smart, he's systematic. The way he picks his victims, the risk of open places, the close escapes. - No evidence. (sighs) The rain washes everything clean. - Maybe it turns him on. - Always made me feel like screwing. - When you were looking for a link between the victims, you didn't run it by the DEA, did you? - DEA, no, why, what's drugs got to do with this? - I don't know yet, but the feds are in on this. You'll be working with an FBI agent from now on. - Captain, not for nothing. This thing gets solved on the streets, not behind a desk. - Hey, he can't do any worse than we have. - When can I expect him, captain? - He'll contact us, cooperate. (light synthesizer music) - Asshole. What's up, Captain? - FBI decided to part with a little information. All three victims were in drug rehab. - Different programs and different years. - Hey, it's the only common denominator we've got. - What's federal IO, captain? - She was a federally protected witness, new identity in exchange for testimony. It's possible the people she testified against found her, but that doesn't account for the killing of the other two. - So where does that leave us? - At least we've narrowed the field of potential victims. - Women between 30 and 50 from drug rehab. Could be thousands of 'em, Lee. So... What about this hotshot agent? - The feds aren't your problem. - It's me. Look, I'm sorry to bother you, it's business, all right? You could be in danger. I'm not trying to frighten you, listen to me. Someone is killing wealthy women, former users. I couldn't help-- (phone clicks) Thinking of you. (dramatic music) - How 'bout this fucking LA weather, man, eh? 20% chance of rain, oh, wait a minute, here we go. Get a load of this, will you? Now this looks more like a fashion show than a bunch of ex-junkies, right? Goddamn assertiveness training. Now who's got Maggie? (dramatic music) - Captain, somebody's on my tail. He's getting close. Close in, close in! (dramatic music) (horn honks) (woman screams) - You move, I splatter you, you cocksucker, don't fucking move, don't fucking move. Take it fucking easy, there you go. What are you doing here tonight, eh, eh? Got nothing better to do, out for a little stroll, eh, you cocksucker, eh? Oh yeah, oh, oh, what do we have here, what the fuck do we have here, what, are you the lone fucking ranger or what? - Federal agent, you dumb shit. - Lieutenant. - Hold it, hold it. Check out his ID. - Come on, man, he looks like a fucking ad for GQ. - [Captain] Wesley Dalton, special agent. - Shoot, what the fuck are you doing here, man? She was our decoy. You all right, Maggie? - Yeah. - Okay, you'll be all right. You want to fuck around, man, you want to work solo? Bullshit, this is what happens. - I work alone 'cause of apes like you. - I'm an ape, I'm a fucking ape? - Lieutenant, not here, not now. - I'll take my weapon. - His gun. - Stay away from me, cowboy. - A female officer nearly gets killed while you rough up a federal agent. - You make it sound so bad. - Vince, I've looked the other way, lately, but there's a limit, you're going back in the game, right? - Yes, yes, coach. - Okay, you work with Dalton and that's that. There's no second choice. Mr. Dalton? - He's a lightweight, captain, he couldn't find his ass with both hands. Listen, Dalton... I'm sorry. - Forget it. - Well, here they are, 007, scumbags on parade. - [Wesley] Now what's this, the comic relief? - No, this is the cream of the crop, pal. - You don't think we're gonna find a guy in this bunch? - They fit the general description. - All right, who's got the smallest dick? Number six, what are you, a fucking comedian? Nice, taxpayers know about this? - Not that it matters, but it's mine. - You got style, Wesley, you got style. Where we going? - To find a lead, not that you'd know one if it bit you. - Know the difference between a porcupine and a Mercedes driver? - Huh? - On the porcupine, the prick's on the outside. (Wesley laughs) (string music) - What is this? - Don't say anything. - I'll try not to fart. - This way, gentlemen. (string music) - Hey, Mr. Dalton, I've been expecting you. - How you doing, this is Mr. Capra, he'll be joining us today, Mr. Allenby. - Fine. If you'll come this way, please, thank you. (string music) Mr. Capra? - Thank you. - Elizabeth Collinger, the woman who died on the train, I was her control officer, some of my best work on new identity, no family and she was very cooperative. New face, new name, even a new voice. Such a waste. - So you placed her in the rehab program? - I was obligated under the agreement but I don't think she needed that much supervision. Her drug habit seemed to end with her old life. - No relapse? - That I'm aware of. She even joined the women's support group after she left the program. - Remember the name of the group? - Let me see, it was something homey and old fashioned sounding. The Quilters or Knitters, something like that. - The Sewing Circle. - Yeah, that was it. Rather ironic for a group of former addicts. (Wesley sighs) (string music) (Capra clears throat) - Let's do it, Sewing Circle. Want to tell me about it? - There's nothing to tell, rich bitch ex-junkies. - That's it? - Hey, it's none of your business. - Hey, look, Wesley, hey, I'll fuck you up. You hold out information on me, you understand? - You're too late. - Shit. (faint stately music) - Ah, good evening, good evening. I'm conducting a modest sociological survey on how the other half lives. - Very well, thank you, good of you not to kick down the door. - Well. - You want a drink? - Ah. Eh, twisted my arm. Yeah. Eh, this is place is un-fucking-believable. I didn't think the FBI got paid that well. - A going away present from my wife. - Hmm, that's some present. Where'd she go? - Another planet. Three blocks away. Christ, you're a nosy bastard, you know that? You have any reason for dropping by here other than to discuss the tragedy of my marriage? - Mmm. Sewing Circle. - [Wesley] The victims were all members. - You knew that? - Just a lucky guess. I tried to warn her about these murders, but... She thought I was trying to frighten her. I suppose I thought maybe if she needed me-- - Oh, wait, wait, wait, back up a minute, your wife was a former user? - And a member of the Sewing Circle. - Shit. (stately music) Any vodka? (somber music) (someone knocks) (man laughs) - [Vince] Shh, shh. - Sit on my face and I'll guess your wait. - Hey, that's rude, man. - All right, I won't guess your weight. - You're smashed. - What makes you say that? - Well, look at you. - Oh. - Who's your friend? - Him? He's nobody. The salt of the earth in an open wound. - Oh, really? Well, he looks very interesting. - Don't be ridiculous. - Hi, I'm Adele Riordan. - Vince Capra, homicide detective. Nice to meet you. - Wesley seems to be moving in slightly different circles these days. - I'm sorry, it's so late and we're so shitfaced. (laughs) - You can always spot the Harvard graduates. - That's quite all right, Mr. Capra. This is actually one of Wes's more amusing surprises. - Wait a minute, since when are you back to using Riordan? We're not divorced yet. - Wes thinks if he ignores it, it'll just go away. I guess that's how I deal with him. Take your jacket off, relax, I'll get you boys some coffee. - You look wonderful. - Happiness agrees with me. - Adele, about the murders, look-- - It has nothing to do with me. I don't want to talk about it, okay? - You may be wrong, ma'am. - [Wesley] This is a private conversation. - Sorry. - You and I have nothing to talk about that Vince can't hear. - All right, that's what you want. - Wesley's so agreeable with you. You must be the money. - Adele, we've got three victims and they were all in your support group. - It's called the Sewing Circle. - We could use a list of members, addresses, phone numbers, you know, things like that. - You guys are serious, aren't you? - It's murder, ma'am. - You'll have to talk to Sarah Keller about it. She's the chairwoman. You know there's over 100 members in the group. - Oh, we're not saying that he's out to kill the lot of you. - And I don't even know the woman on the train. - You knew Maggie Warren and Marilyn Boyd. - And besides. I have you two, don't I? - But... We can't be with you day and night. Why don't you take a vacation? You know, go outta town a while? - I'm sorry, I can't. - How did I know you were gonna say that? - [Woman] Cording should be thin enough to pass twice through the B board. - I hate this sissy poo shit. - Ah, Sarah Keller. - Yes, what can I do for you? - Well, I'm Detective Capra and this is Special Agent Dalton - Oh, yes, Wesley. Adele told me you'd be stopping by. I was sorry it didn't work out with you two. - We saved her life, that's what's important. Do you have the list? - This is the current roster. - Thank you. Do you have any idea who did this? - For every person who gets well, there's another who gets hurt. I've no doubt there are those who would blame the circle for something real or imagined, but who could do something like this? - You might want to cancel your meetings, ma'am. - Out of the question. My women'll need support more than ever. Now if there's nothing else. - No, you've been very kind, thank you, Mrs. Keller. - Ms. (somber music) - Vince. Come in. (Vince sighs) (somber music) - Are you checking up on me? - (laughs) Obvious? - Is that because you're supposed to or because you want to? (somber music) Can I get you a drink? - No thanks. I didn't think you... - I don't. But that doesn't mean you can't. - I'd just as soon as... Not dull my senses. - I like the sound of that. So what are we doing? - Checking each other out, I guess. (sultry music) I was wondering. What kinda guy makes moves on the wife of the guy that he's working with? - Ex-wife. (sultry music) Is that what you're doing? Making moves? (sultry music) - I'm trying. (sultry music) (Vince punches the door) (romantic music) (sexy music) (people applauding) - What'll it be, Mac? - Got a beer? - Sure. Two drink minimum, 10 bucks. - 10 bucks, eh? 10 bucks, keep it. - Something else I can do for you? (sexy music) Name's Satin, it'll cost you 100. - Deal. - Have a seat at the first table. (crowd whoops) (sexy music) (crowd cheers) (romantic music) (crowd whoops) (sexy music) - How's it going, good? - Yeah. - Yeah, good, good. You're... You're a great dancer, you know that? - So you got someplace we can go? - Yeah, yeah, I got a room, it's... Not far. It should be all right, just relax. - You know, an extra 100 gets you the whole night. I'll make it worth it. - I'll bet you will, you got a deal. - All right, maybe I score some blow and... - That's covered. I got everything we need. - Hi baby, how you doing, little miss nobody? Hey, man, how you doing? Say man, you wanna deal with these bitches? Well, then, you got to talk to me. - I don't work for you, Angel. - It don't look right, you working freelance. (knife clicks) (sexy music) - Good night. - [Bartender] Angel, not here, take it outside. (Angel laughs) - Motherfucker. I'll see you later. Bye, baby. - Are you crazy? - Are you ready? Come on, let's go. (sexy music) (beer bottle shatters) (girl screams) (man grunts) (punches land) (Angel whimpers) (sexy music) (Satin giggles) - Can I ask you something? - Mhmm. - Why me? - 'Cause you smelled good. It's a secret. - Okay. Does that mean stupid? - No, it means honest. (Vince laughs) - Okay. You know... I bet we don't even have the same silver pattern or anything. - Hey, relax. I'm a work in progress, okay? So we just take it one day at a time. - Oh, okay. We could. - Hi baby. - Hi. (man moans) - Oh, you're beautiful, baby, ooh, yeah, that's what I want, that's what I want. (both giggle) - Hey, babe. - You know what you want? - You got something for me, huh? - Oh, yeah, I do, right here. Right there. (both inhale) - Yeah, but... We gotta take care of business first. - Business, first, what'd we talk about, huh? What'd we say, baby, we'd say 200? Is that it, well, I'll tell you what. Why don't we do... Four, baby, huh? Huh? Yeah. (sultry music) - Are you rich or something? - Baby, forget about the ring, baby, wasting time. - You're still dressed, huh? - You want me to take it off? - Yeah, you gotta show me what you got, huh? - Okay. - Let me see it. - You got it, baby. - Slowly, huh? - Okay, talk to me. (Satin giggles) (sultry music) - Oh, yeah, baby. (Satin giggles) So, Satin, tell me, what's your real name? - I told you, it's Kathy, what's your real name, huh? (man chuckles) - Call me Dick. - Jesus, I don't know if I can handle that. - Oh, you can handle it, baby, you can handle it and you will. - What have you got in here anyway, huh? - [Dick] It's nothing, it's nothing. - Wait, what are these? - Nothing, babe. Give me a little of that, please. Yeah, come on, baby. (both inhale) (both sigh) Lean back, lean back, just like that, baby. Yeah. Oh, yeah, mmm. Ooh, give me your arm, baby, put your wrist in there, that's it, that's it, baby, give me your wrist, that's it, Kathy, I promise I won't hurt you. I won't hurt you, baby. (sighs) Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, baby. (somber music) - Hey baby. Kathy? Kathy? Kathy, wake up, wake up, oh, fuck, goddammit, Kathy, wake up, wake up, oh shit. (somber music) (man whistles) (dramatic music) (horn blasts) (tires screech) (man yelps) (tires screech) (siren wails) (dramatic music) (siren wails) - Hold it, freeze! Hands behind your head. You have the right to remain silent, and anything you say can and will be sued against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney, you have the right to have the attorney-- - Jordan Richard Rosewall, felony hit and run, drug possession, possession of deadly weapons. He'll probably beat the drugs and weapons charges on illegal search. - Where does he live? - Pasadena. (laughs) - Hey, Jordan Rosewall, his wife is a friend of Adele's, very wealthy. - No shit. - See what you can get on him before they spring him. - We oughta check him for priors. - He's clean, no worse than a couple of speeding tickets. Can I see that? Ms. Rosewall, hi, how you doing, this is Wes Dalton. Is Jordan there? Ah, mmm, when do you expect him back? Nah, I was just trying to find him before he left. All right, well I'll just give him a call tomorrow? All right, okay, thanks a lot, bye. He's supposed to be in Chicago on business. Due back sometime tonight. He's been gone two days. - You coming with us? - You go ahead. - Listen, squeeze all you can out of him. I'll be there in a minute. - I can't stall his lawyer forever. - Excuse me. What are you doing? - Working backwards. He's been somewhere for the last two days and it wasn't Chicago. Let me call up every reported homicide geographically within the last two days. - That'd take weeks. - [Wesley] All right, what about just today? - No, no time to check it out. - [Wesley] Best guess. - How 'bout that one? - Rainy days get you hot, don't they? Make you do crazy things? Is that what it takes to get you off, huh? - Look, spare me the playground psychology, would you? - Fuck him, fuck you, and your whole fucking family. What's up? Huh? - He's just not cooperating. - What, what, what, are you, what are you, what do we look like, fucking assholes to you, what? - You know what, you're a serious disappointment to me, Rosewall, beautiful wife, nice kids. - Jesus. (snorts) - Do I know you? - I know you. - All right, that's it, that's it, I'm not saying another word until I speak with my attorney. - That's it then, let's go. - Okay, why-- - Fuck him! - [Reese] What the fuck is going on with you guys? - Shh, you did great, you did great, come on, baby. Come on. Attaboy. No. - Hey. - I would like to confer with my client. - Of course. - Oh, great. - Jordan... - Perfect. (somber music) (Vince whistles) (people moan) - Little bit of effort, huh? (Vince chuckles) - Ooh. - Kinda hard to imagine a guy like Rosewall would stay at a place like this, Jesus. - Part of the turnon. - Check this out. Check it out. (girl moans) - A gynecologist's convention. (man moans) - Look at the cassavas on this babe. - Hey, check those drawers. - [Reese] God love you. - [Vince] Shit. Nothing here, man. (woman moans) (sultry music) - So what do you think, seriously? - Look, you see it's dark in here? - Come on. - It was a busy night. Coulda been him, could be this guy too. - This guy? - Yeah. - Get serious. - The guy you should talk to is angel, the big black dude. Pimp. He musta got a good look at him. - And where do we find him? - He hasn't been in since someone kicked the shit outta him, must be holed up somewhere. Now can I get you guys a drink or what? - Right idea, wrong place. - How much for the or what? - I gotta go, I'll see you in a little bit. - Come on, you'll stay for a drink, won't you? I won't hear of it, night shift'll find Angel. You're off duty, Vince, come on, hey, you need to cultivate a new circle of friends if you expect to advance yourself. Gentlemen. This is Vincent Capra. His partner Reese is the one groping the waitress here. They're cops, so be careful of what you say. - So what about this Rosewall guy? - Well, I'll tell you one thing. The Rosewalls represent serious money, almost as much as Adele. - Well, what pushes his buttons? I mean, a guy marries young, has more money than is good for him, not a typical serial killer, sounds good, but is he our boy? - Maybe, but Satin's death was almost certainly accidental. No mutilation, no Sewing Circle, no rain. Reese, how's that beer doing? - I'd better go home. - Hey, sorry about that groping thing. Good night, Reese, drive safe. - You got something to say, say it. - You can't even link him to the hooker, let alone the rain killer. LAPD's not looking too good on this one. Three dead women, bungled arrest. - Spill it out. - This investigation has gone nowhere. The bureau wants an arrest or a fall guy. I don't intend to go down with you, you understand? - (sighs) Gotta go, meeting someone. - Not leaving already? - You got a problem with that? - It'd just be better if you stayed. - The fuck is the matter with you, Wes? - That's what it is about you, huh, you're looking good all of a sudden, Vince, huh? (punch lands) (light piano music) - Can't win. (sniffles) (phone rings) - Hello? - Adele. - Wesley. What do you want? - [Wesley] I have to see you. - Really, well, now's not quite such a good time. - [Wesley] Why, what are you doing? - I'm busy, it's none of your business. - [Wesley] Just a drink. - Wesley, I'd rather eat glass, don't do this again. (Vince laughs) - You know what? I think you were a little rough on him. - Really, well, I wasn't the one who punched him in the nose, was I? - Hey. - My hero. - He deserved it. Tell me about the drugs. What made you quit? - I looked like shit. The drugs stopped working and so did I. - Doing what? - Well, if you're that interested, perhaps I'll show you sometime. - Oh, really, hmm. - I nearly gave up my career for cocaine. I even lost interest in sex. - Come over here. - Except as a way to get more. - Drugs? - Of course. - Well, then, you get it back. (somber music) (thunder cracks) (dramatic music) - Open the door, open the door, please, please, please, let me in, help me, help me, please, open the door! (woman screams) (dramatic music) - All right, was he tall or short? - Average, I guess, I don't know. It all happened so fast. - No answer at Capra's apartment. - What about his hair, curly, straight, light, dark, long? - Dark, dark, but maybe it was wet. - She couldn't tell a dick from a donut. I'm gonna get you with an artist, see if a sketch jogs anything, hey, George, you want to come in here please? - And Jordan Rosewall is our prime suspect here. He has unlimited legal and financial resources which makes our job even more difficult but it can't be an excuse for our performance. Now we can't find this pimp called Angel who might be able to tie Rosewall to the suspect, the call girl, Captain, you wanna... - [Captain] The crimes indicate a revenge against the Sewing Circle. And although Mrs. Rosewall knows at least one member of the group, she herself is not a member, she has never used drugs, and no connection has been found. - Where were you last night? - [Captain] Without any solid motive, we're nowhere. - Busy. - You've got the list. Talk to every member of the Sewing circle. Somebody must know something, Chief, you have anything you want to add? - Yeah, your pensions are on the line here tonight. You fuck this up, you're history, you're outta here. Tonight's forecast calls for 80% chance of rain. Well get going! (claps) Yeah, get the hell out of here. - Hope everything came out all right. - You two look beat. - Yeah, I'm wasted. - [Wesley] Hey, I'm fine, what's our next move? - Sleep, drop dead. - What's the matter, Vinnie, no sense of humor? - You're on your own. Where you going? - To bed. - Later, I want you to catch this pimp before dickhead does. - Yeah, sure, I knew that. (somber music) - You can leave it right there. I thought you were my deliveryman. - I... Was in the neighborhood, and... - What's the matter, Vince? (somber music) (rap music) - Hold it, I'm a cop. Hey, you Angel? - Yeah, yeah, this look like heaven to you, white boy? (Reese grunts) - Angel, I just want to talk, we're looking for the guy who beat you up. Stop, Angel, you stupid fuck, stop! Open this door, open this fucking door, Angel, come on, I just want to talk. - Show me your badge. - Okay, here it is. Hard or easy, it's up to you. (Angel sighs) All right, step out. - I ain't in no shape to run. - Shut the fuck up, that was stupid, man. (Angel groans) - I remind you, my client's appearance is a courtesy not to be abused. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Okay, number one, two steps forward, turn right. Your other right. - Anything? - Step back, number two, two steps forward. - I told you, I couldn't see his face. - Turn right. - I just don't know, man. - [Reese] Step back, number three, two steps forward. - You said you'd know him. - Turn right. - Ain't none of these dudes, right. He was bigger, meaner looking. - Step back. Number four, two steps forward, turn right. (suspenseful music) Step back. Number five, two steps forward, turn right. - I think that's him, man, that could be him, right there, number four. - You positive? - Yeah. Or number six. Man, I'm just not sure. - Step back. - So tell me some good news. - No positive ID, no case. I can bargain the felony count down to a misdemeanor. As a first offender, you get probation. - Hey man, look it was either him or it was number six. Now what is the motherfucking problem? - Number six was a cop. - You'd've made a lousy witness anyway. - Ah, man, well, fuck you too. - Mr. Rosewall, there's a note for you. - Something's up. - I'll run you home. - No, thanks, I got some business today. - Who gave you that note to give to Rosewall? - I don't know, wasn't there one minute, next minute it was. - Great. (romantic music) - We got a stakeout across the street. I've alerted the doorman, just keep your door locked. There's something I got to ask you. - Well, why don't we talk in bed? Hey. - You say drugs kept you and Wes together. What does that mean, exactly? - Well, it means the feds can get the best stuff, right? The truth is, when I went straight, I didn't need Wes anymore and I was heading right for the bottom of the pile, the way Wes is now. - What do you mean, the way Wes is now? - Wes had a bigger habit than I ever had. (somber music) You didn't know that? (Vince sighs) (phone rings) - How far will he go to get you back? - [Wes On Voicemail] Adele, it's me. I know you're there. Tell Vince that Hacket's looking for him. Must be nice to take the day off. Hope you two had a good time. - You need to go. (romantic music) (eerie music) - How's our coverage? - Well, we've got uniforms at all the confirmed locations. We're spread pretty thin. - Have we heard from Capra yet? - On his way in. When you get these women on the phone, ask if they've heard of any tragedies in the Circle, before the murders started, anything. - Christ, they're all tragedies. - Tonight, we get him. - Where are you going? Where are you going? (gun cocks) (Wes sniffs) - Yeah? Here you go. Take care. (doorman grunts) (suspenseful music) - Wesley? You scared the shit out of me. What are you wearing? - You're so beautiful. - Wesley, what do you want? How did you get in here? - I liked being rich. I liked having you. My wife. - Wesley... You look awful. Do you want to sleep? - Is it as good when he's inside you? Do you come more with him? You let him do that to you. What we did. - Wesley, let it go. - Let it go? Let it go! (Adele grunts) (thunder booms) - (groans) God's having a pissing contest out there. - 33 locations, that's too fucking many, we don't have enough men to cover this. - I'll get some if I have to call the sheriff. - Do we know where Rosewall is? - Hasn't been home and his lawyer's not talking. - Where's Wesley? - He went out a little while ago. He was pretty sure tonight's the night. (eerie music) (Adele grunts) - Wesley! (groans) (dramatic music) (Wesley sobs) - Somebody's coming. (somber music) - Hello? (eerie music) - A man came in a few minutes ago. He must've gone up. - Brilliant. (doorman groans) Better call an ambulance. Don't let anybody in or out. - Get some men to cover the basement and garage. A man posted here in the lobby, Vince! (somber music) - Don't touch her. (somber music) - We want 'em alive, Wes. On the right, 12C, hey! Wesley. - Back off, Vince. Just back off. (somber music) (Rosewall punches the wall) (dramatic music) - Hey, fuck face! (dramatic music) (alarm rings) - Freeze! - All right, all right, don't shoot, don't shoot! (gun fires) (Rosewall groans) (dramatic music) (gun fires) (dramatic music) - He was on the roof. - Dead? - You bet. You were screwing her, weren't you? (Vince sighs) (glass shatters) - That woulda really pissed her off. Heiress instead of artist. - We've got him dead to rights, bloody footprints match his shoes, pattern of the wounds identical, murder weapon exactly like the one from Rosewall's car, the ring. - MD said she was already dead before she was stabbed. - None of the other victims were smothered or beaten. This thing with the ring, dammit. - It's the department's opinion that a jury would convict on the evidence and the FBI's not about to say different. - The writing in the elevator, Lee? - We can't prove he wrote it, and it doesn't prove anything if he did. - What about Wes? - Special agent Dalton has resigned. They don't expect charges against him under the circumstances. - The son of a bitch Rosewall killed his wife. If Wes ripped his heart out, I wouldn't blame him. At least he got all that money. - Anything unusual happen with Rosewall at the lineup? - No. - Anything bogus happen? - Well, there was that business with the note, that was pretty strange. Here it is, Cap. - It's not here. (vacuum drones) (Wes sniffles) (Vince knocks) - Getting ready to sell? - Don't need to now, I don't have to do anything I don't want to do, ever. - You lost me. - Her family's not too happy about it, but. - Well, yeah, no, it was just that Reese mentioned something about you being rich, I thought it was from selling this place, that's all. You were inheriting Adele's estate? - Well, I don't know how much it's gonna be but from the way everybody's acting, I guess it's gonna be a lot. Need some money? - Listen, about Adele and I-- - Don't, just don't. You don't have to explain anything. No one could resist Adele, least of all you. - Eh. Just wish I was sure about Rosewall. - Well, he's dead, sure of that. Besides, it's no longer my problem. Either help me clean or get the fuck out. - Mmm, how 'bout getting drunk? (somber music) - Been looking for you guys all over town. - Can't you see we're busy, what's up? - You were asking about the knives. - There were only six left in the property room. - Lab tested seven, they're positive. - Inappropriate time to talk business, don't you think? - I'm sorry, Wes. I gotta go. - Vince? You'll stay? - Til the bitter end. - What's on your mind, Vince? - Art. (thunder booms) - I'm surprised at you, Vince, this is so theatrical. (door buzzes) (thunder booms) - [Vince] First time I saw her, she was working right over there. Thought she was a rich lady with an expensive hobby. Turns out she was good, even respectable. Just about ready to have a nice successful life. - [Wesley] You want me to feel the tragedy, this great loss to the world, is that it? Maybe to mourn for what might have been for you and Adele? You want me to understand and forgive you? - The ring was a big mistake, pal. - In what way? - Overkill. Just little too neat, you know, it got me thinking. The envelope that wasn't with his stuff. The pillow. The knife that wasn't in the property room. (gun fires) (Vince yells) - It only seems fair and right that it comes down to you and me, it's over, Vince. (pants) I can just let you bleed, in a half an hour, come over there and put a bullet right through your eye. - [Vince] Nah. (gun fires) - Still here, Vince? - I'm still here, motherfucker. (gun fires) (Wes groans) - I gotta kill you now, Vince, you know that. (gun fires) - You killed her, man. - I killed all of them. Getting revenge on those Three Sewing Circle cuts was a bonus. - The woman on the train? - Wasn't involved at all. Just an FBI witness who happened to be a member, a way to get myself on the case. I played you all like a string section. (gun fires) I'm inside your head now. - [Vince] I thought you loved her. - I do. Buying me off with that goddamn townhouse when she was worth millions, pay me support, trade me in. She owes me. (gun fires) (suspenseful music) Almost couldn't go through with it, though, that was the funny thing. - [Vince] You're a very sick man. - Well. I thought you of all people would understand, Vince. Killing her was Plan B. Plan A was to scare her back to me. I couldn't let anybody else have her. I couldn't let you have her. (gun clicks) (gun fires) (somber music) - Wouldn't have to come back. - It wasn't finished. (somber music) (Vince groans) - [Wes Voiceover] What's the matter, Vince? - I gotta get to an emergency room. - [Wes Voiceover] Let it go. (laughs) (somber music)
