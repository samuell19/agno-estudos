I love her a hundred percent. Forever. - A hundred percent. - A hundred percent. I can't imagine myself waking up with somebody else. Damn! More than a hundred. Two hundred percent, right? Oh, sweetie! Can you do 300? We share the same life, the same beliefs. Mediocre in life, mediocre in love. We said no lies. This is fake, for God's sake! Do you think I'm a fool? Answer me. Do you think I'm a fool? - Well, no. - No. In this country, only three people out of a thousand get married, and two out of three weddings end in a divorce. How many friends do you have on Facebook? - Many. - 1000. - I don't know. - See it. - Where can I see it? - Ah, here-! A thousand, maybe? About that number. Only two people out of a thousand will stay together. They'll grow old, like in the movies. Only two. Am I being too pessimistic? I don't want to come off as a killjoy. Mariana. No, every now and then it's good to go over the top. Why do you want to get married? Do you think you're the one couple out of 500? I mean, you can lie to yourselves, but not to me... No fucking way. I'm the best wedding planner. I can't waste my time, sorry. I can't plan a wedding for those who lie to themselves and don't love each other a hundred percent. Love is the most important thing to me, and I can't see it in you. Mariana, hold on. Maybe they do love each other. Magali, why are we doing this? For money? I can't lie to them. Goodbye, friends. - No, sorry, Mariana, but we... - No, wait, Begoña. Don't worry. We'll have our dream wedding. Someone will plan it. Don't worry, gorgeous. Jose, tell her something! We'll be happy. That's the only thing that matters, my love. Forever? Growing old, like in the movies. I got them. You've passed the test. You've passed the test. You've passed the test. You just have to sign here. Here and here. If they lie, why shouldn't I? There's something I need to confess. From the moment you walked in here, I saw pure love. And the more they pay... the more love they'll have. BETTER DEAD THAN WED Mom! The dessert? You said you'd bring the dessert. Uh, I forgot it! I forgot it! Sorry, sorry, sorry. I've been working like crazy. I don't get why people get married. Lucky you, right? Where's Mom? Getting ready for her new sweetheart. Ah, Mom, Mom... What's with those suitcases? Shit, is she moving in with him, Ale? No, I wish. No, these are mine. Because I told Mom I'm moving in with you. What? What? Didn't you think of telling me before packing your suitcases? It's just while I get the scholarship. I swear. Just for a bit. I'm gonna get it. No, I don't know. - Why not? - Alejandra, who's here? What does she mean? Who else is coming? You should've told me. Mariana! Hi, Mom. I thought you were Epigmenio. Weird name, weird life. It's very late now. I'll check on the food. Please, don't leave me here with her. Please, please. She became super noisy. - I need details. Tell me. - No, why? What's wrong with you? - Epi, hi. - Hey, Alejandra. What's up! I've brought a dessert you'll love. So, how long have you been dating? A while. The truth is we don't go on dates often. We've skipped a few steps. What? We'd rather stay home. You would've met Epi if you had visited us before. I didn't visit you because I can't, Mom. You know I'm very busy at work. Besides, spring is the busiest season. Of course! We met last spring. Elena told me you're a wedding planner. Yes, I'm a wedding planner. It sounds quite American, don't you think? When I got married, my mother planned the wedding. - Oh, so you're a divorcee? - No, a widower. Oh, a widower. Poor thing. Maria Luisa has transcended. Yeah, it was a terrible, fulminating cancer. I'm so sorry. - How old? - Mariana. What? Well, she was young. 42 years old. A child. I'm so sorry. But I was meaning how old are you, Epi. Ah. I'm 65 years old. He dyes his hair. Don't mind her. Mariana and I have always done this interrogation thing since we were kids. So... Yeah, it became a tradition. So, do you have children? Yes, a daughter, Leticia. She's a neuroscientist. Nerds. Actually I wanted to ask you something, Epi. Sorry, I have to take this call. Yeah, sure. Magali, what is it? No, listen. Calm her. It's normal for the brides to cry a day before the wedding. Give her an infusion and tell her tomorrow we'll talk. You know what, Magali? Tell her that her face will swell if she keeps crying. She's interested, isn't she? - Okay, bye. - Yeah, give me her number... Sorry. There's a whole science behind my job. Is everything okay? Yes, I'm very excited. Today it's the happiest day of my life. It is, right? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, of course. You're ready. And I swear I love him. I love him a hundred percent. Okay. And you're telling me this because there's something you haven't told me? No, no, no, this is just for toasting. - Give it to me! - Here. Can I tell you something? They're waiting for us downstairs. We're almost ready. Thanks. So exciting! Wow! Please, don't be mad. Here it comes. It's just that I can't tell anyone. My bridesmaids are my sisters-in-law, my friends, Fede's friends. Look like you care, and she'll spill the tea. Yesterday, Robertito, Fede's friend, came to my bachelorette. I kinda knew him. It was something casual, casual. We met at the restrooms, and... We just kissed a bit, but I don't know what to do, Mariana. I got feelings. - What can I do? Should I tell Fede? - No! Robertito asked me to elope with him. And didn't you think that was the best time to uninvite him to the wedding? And what would I tell Fede? I kissed your best friend and uninvited him to the wedding. What if he asks me to elope with him? You know what, Bego? Love is my priority. If you want to elope with Robertito, I'll help you. I can call everything off, just now. Magali, let's start Operation Elopement. Let's keep Fede entertained with some girls or something. - No, no, listen. - Of course, poor guy... - Do I call it off? - Yeah. Cancel Operation Elopement. I don't want to break Fede's heart. No. He's the best thing that's happened to me. Of course. Maybe you can tell him the truth in a couple of years. Who hasn't kissed people in the bathroom? Okay, let me tell you my story. Sit. I was in your place. Full of doubts. In the end, the only thing that matters... are the smiles, the moments you share, the support you give each other. Relationships go through so many stages, but when you find true love, you have no option but to take the leap and scream... I love you. Didn't you give the ring back to that guy? Yeah, I mean. I don't know why I used that example. It's a completely different situation. The important thing is that today your new life begins, Begoña. And everything is okay with my ex. We're still friends. Actually, guess who made the cake for today? When you told me you have a restaurant, I thought you meant an actual restaurant. What? This is an actual restaurant, Lucy. Without tables, without customers, nothing. I mean, that's the dream. But it isn't a restaurant yet. What do you need to open it? The thing is I only know how to cook. Mariana was going to do the rest. And now that I'm on my own, I don't even know where to start. Mexico is a country of bureaucracy. I know. I was trying to pay the landlord, and I asked him, "why can't I pay in cash? I can't open a bank account," and he told me he knows some lawyers, but they're expensive. So I have to pay to be allowed to pay. It's ridiculous. I mean, being a resident in Mexico is a hassle. What's wrong? Listen, Mariana and I are friends, okay? We're business partners. She's a customer. A customer who broke my heart, but a customer still. We have a healthy relationship, an adult relationship from which we've moved on. Completely moved on. Help me. Help me, please? Let's take it because it's getting late. It is what it is. It's the worst day of my life. I know. I know, Robertito, but look, you have to think of your future, your new life. - It'll be okay. - No, no, no! It'll be okay. Trust me. Ready, my love? I am. I don't Know. Ready! I'm over, I'm over, I'm over it. My poor buddy. He's... heartbroken. It's just business, and we're professional. Right? It doesn't matter. If anything happens, tell her I'm your girlfriend. Okay. Okay, dear Luis. This way. - Hi. - Hi. You need a few more drinks. Hey, here! - Thank you very much. - I'm an idiot. There you go. This will make you feel better. Luisito, thank you, as always. Nice to see you, Magali. I'm gonna say hi to my friend Mariana. My friend! His friend. Luis! Here, drink it. Yeah, that's right. Feeling better? Done. Mariana, do you copy me? Shit might hit the fan. Shit might hit the fan. Not literally. It all looks clean. No! Ah, Robertito. Hey, hey. Well, I have to work. But I'll be right back. I'll be back. They'll make you some... Two more here, please. I'll be back. I'll be back, okay? Hey, you make the most of these weddings. Ah, Robertito? - Yeah. - Yeah, how are you? You look... What's the word? Different. That's how people look when they feel good, Luis. Happy. Enjoying everything. So happy, you know? And you? I'm good. Very, very good. I've just finished furnishing the apartment, and the purple carpet, do you remember? The one you disliked? Well, now I like it. You were right. Well, I'm glad somebody is enjoying it. - I've got to work. - Yeah. - What do you mean? - Mariana! Yeah, I enjoy it, with... Are you coming with her? Yeah, she's Lucia, my roomie, my buddy, my confidante, my comrade. Just friends? Yeah, I got it. I got it. I've been going from date after date, you have no idea. Making up for the lost time. You have no idea. Well, I'm leaving. No, no, you got me, you know? I got you? What can I say? Why should I lie? I mean, it's not like I'm gonna hurt you. Lucia, I'm coming with her, but not as friends, but... like two lovebirds. What? Why are you laughing? Of course, I've never heard you saying you're a lovebird. With somebody else, Luis. Somebody else. Listen... Move! Damn. You... Bro... I never told you she was a summer fling, and now that she's back from Colombia... Old flames... - Colombian? - Yeah. No, you didn't tell me. A few nice months. Truly amazing! Yeah, yeah, I got it. I just found it weird that you jumped into a new relationship so quickly. Because, I mean, you were always the slow type. - Awful, awful. - Awful. But you know what I liked about her? That I didn't have to flirt with her because she knows what she wants. She's not like it's a game... I'm so glad. Well, I have to... She's amazing. I love her. Right. I'll marry her. What? I'm marrying. I'm getting married, Mariana. - I'm getting married. - Ah. - Are you serious? - Yeah, yeah. Well, congratulations. When is the wedding? Soon, very soon. I mean, not now. But very soon. I mean, in the end it's just a party. I'm sure she needs the papers to be a resident, right? What? Don't be mean. People do fall in love. It's good love, divine love. Good love. Like in all marriages. Of course. Well, I'm happy for you. Yeah. I don't know if I should believe you, but those eyes and that sheepish smile. - What sheepish smile? - To the newlyweds! I mean it. I'm truly happy for you and for her. I know you were dying to get married. In fact, I can plan your wedding. What? I wish you all the best. Brother. I'm the best, and nobody knows you like I do. - That's good. - Fool! Okay, sure, perfect. - We're adults, aren't we? - Yes. I knew you were dying to get married, no matter what, no matter the person. With the love of my life. With the love of your life, yes. Well, see you on Monday at the office. - I love Mondays. - Perfect. See you on Monday. Great! Cool! Hi. What's up? Well, we're here, in the name of love. This one. Mariana... Mariana! - Three cheers for love! - Yeah, yeah. Yeah, to the love I feel for you, Fede, my brother. And I love you, gorgeous! But, especially... What I truly want to say... especially, I wanna say I love her! I love her, Bego, my Bego! - He's drunk. - Yes. Wasn't he your DJ? Shut up, shut up! Do you want me to beat the shit out of him? - What happened? - I don't know. Why don't you tell everyone - what we did last night - What? In the bar's bathroom? What did you do yesterday? Everyone knocked on the door and I'd say, "No, it's occupied." I went to the bathroom. You're my soulmate... You're my only love. - Bego, what the hell? - Yes. Bego! Come. What the hell, Bego! No, no! No, no! Help him! No, no, no! Damn you, Roberto! Why are you doing this to me? Shit! Careful, careful! Oh, my God! - Come. - Yes. Did they even pay? There's nothing we can do. To the next one. What goes next? Mauricio and Renata, Carlos and Sofia, and Luis. We'll plan Luis's wedding. Really? - Girl. - Oh, I know. Mariana! Mariana! Mariana! What did you do? Magali called me. What did you want me to do? Congratulations on your wedding. Send me your gift list. Why are you doing this? Because I'm either a fool or a genius. Mariana, you gave him the ring back. You told him you didn't want to get married, and now you're doing this? It sounds like self-sabotage, don't you think? No, not at all. Are you sure you want to plan Luis's wedding? I'm not sure, but I'm intrigued. You're a psycho. - Hey! - Hey, you scare me! Take a chill pill, man. You did the cleverest shit you could've done in your life. No, man. I'll call her, tell her the truth and end with this bullshit, now. What the hell is truth, man? It's impossible to know the truth, especially in this post-truth world, am I right? I just wanted to tease her a bit. Have you forgotten what she did to you? I just wanted to annoy her a bit, man. My king, today you have to win. If you do this, she'll definitely ask for forgiveness. Then, what? Do I go on with this? Should I marry Lucia? Should we have kids? No, you don't have to go that far. Mariana will yield before that. And if you get married to her, what's the problem? You can hire me. Bring DJ Dion to your wedding. A super party. And if you have a kid? I'll be their godfather. Is there a problem? Lucia will refuse, man. A good seller knows that. Either you persuade with facts or through blackmail, and you know her better than I do. I'm a romance genius, am I not? You're... No, no, no, dude. - I won't do it, period. - Please, Lucy. Listen, don't do it for me. It's for you. It's the best for you. Listen, I'm not that desperate, Luis. Hey. Listen, she made me look like a fool when she gave the ring back. I don't wanna look like a fool twice if she finds out everything was a lie. I don't know. It's not my fault. Fire her. Tell her I don't want her in my wedding. No. This woman is relentless. Besides, it's a bit your fault. You said if anything happened, I could say we were dating. - Accept your responsibility. - No, no, I can't fake a wedding. - That's ridiculous. - That's the point. We won't fake anything. We get married, a little party, a little fun. Yeah, and think of your papers. It's your dream, having your own apartment, can you imagine it? Your own bank account, getting a job. A citizen of the world. And then we'll have kids or what? No. We can annul the marriage in two years. But that won't be an issue because you'll be living - the "Mexican dream." - Mexican dream. Otherwise, people will think badly of you. - Exactly. - It's for your own good. Lu, people like divorcees more than happy singletons. That's right... Don't ask me why. I didn't make the rules. No, no, Luis. No, I don't want to do it. I can't. Imagine you're my plus one in any other wedding, but this wedding means the residence and freedom for you, Lu. When was the last time you paid the rent? There you go, see? Let's screw this system that divides us with its stupid borders. Enough! Are you making all this up to get rid of me? No, no, no. I mean, freedom. I mean that, citizenship, individuality, a passport. Okay, Lu, what should we do if we see that they're beating someone on the street? Do we just leave them? Do we tell them they're exaggerating? No, we help them. Oh, Dioni, I can't. Ah! Lu, let me be your visa husband. For how long will this be? We'll talk about it. Tell me until I watch the video. Oh. Call him now. Something's wrong. This is very weird. Well, if it's weird, call him and call it off. It's none of your business. Yeah, right? Well. No, we'll carry on with this, okay? Why? You've called off worse things. Your wedding, for instance. Why not this? Magali, take care of the weddings we have scheduled and don't take others for now. This will be my masterpiece, and it'll take a lot of my time. Usually she's not this excited about her job. - It's guilt. - It's bullshit. It's bullshit. Say my favorite things. Come on. Your Japanese knife and making cocktails for me. He hates shrimp and has a lovely snore. She'll ask for my favorite position. What is it? Doggy. No, spooning. Ah, you've changed? But you know what? Yeah, tell her doggy style. She can say doggy style? Yeah, she'll hate it. She'll hate it! And the most important thing, Lucia, you were my first one, okay? And yeah, she was my first one, and it's lovely how destiny will make her... my last one. - Very, very romantic. - Yeah. Recycled ring. Okay, let's do this. We'll celebrate your wedding, I mean, your love. - Isn't there anything else? - No. We said no lies. This is all fake. Do you think I'm an idiot? Answer me! Do you think I'm an idiot? Do we have to answer that? Are you okay? It's a test we do with all our clients, but you've passed it. So, tell me, what's the thing you like the most about Luis? What can I say, Mary? - Mariana. - Damn, they're so many, Mary. Well, I love his Japanese knife. - Ah, the... - How he makes cocktails... The lovely things he tells me. I even like his snores, Mary. Can you believe it? Well, what about his favorite position? I know it. Doggy. Awesome! - Of course. - Yeah. - Yes. - Yes. Do you know what I like the most about her? She's a confident woman. Ah! Well, normal, but she's brave enough to face her trauma - and overcome it. Right, my love? - Yeah, yeah. She's been honest from the very beginning. She'd never hurt me. We'll, lucky you. Yeah, and the most important thing. She keeps her promises. - That's quite clear. - Yeah. Well, Mary, you know Poochi loves dancing, so we want something that feels very much like us, you know? Like... #LuiCia. Ugh, kill yourselves. Kill me or LuiCia, I don't care. How long have you been together? Ah... Well, answering that is like looking back to the past, and the truth is that LuiCia looks into the future. Okay. And when do you want your wedding to be? Well, in about a month and a half? Yeah, maximum. If we extend it too much. Don't tell me you're pregnant. - No, no. - Not yet. Not yet, because we know in a year or two anything can happen. Yeah. I mean, we have this urge to celebrate love. - Yes. - Yes. Yeah, I suppose you also have this urge to get your papers for the Mexican residence, right? No, no Mary, not really. The point is we'd like to get married, Mariana. It's not so complicated. It's just a party. Yeah, just a party. The godfather. Who's gonna be the godfather? Let me guess. Dionisio? - Of course. - Right. My, my. My, my. - Hey. - Hi. - Dioni. - The son of Zeus? Are you, Ale? The ex-girlfriend's sister? And you're the godfather now? The godfather... and D-D-D-DJ, Dioni, the life of the party. Livening up the best events, always, you know. I'll be there, at the front row, witnessing love. Really? Why so many papers? So much yada yada. Flesh feels so nice. It's so easy to just... Look at each other, feel their touch, muffle their fear. It's funny. I've always thought the same. You just have to sign the contract, and that's all. - I'll leave it here. - Oh, Poochi! Here you go. Congratulations, LuiCia. - Thank you. - Thank you. #LuiCia, you forgot it. Awesome! - Did you see her face? - Yeah. - She was pissed, but I'm scared. - Yeah. "Oh, I won't ask the position because I know it." As if you told that to all your customers. Hey, Luis. Do you think she's suspicious? - No! - No? No, not at all. Besides, what's the worst that could happen? I'm helping you. I'll annoy her just a bit, throw a big party with my buddies, hire DJ Dioni, and we're all happy, okay? LuiCia, victorious. Luis, why the fuck are you doing this? Why don't you sit with her? Talk with her, and that's it. - No, that'd be the easy road. - Exactly. No, I want her to feel the frustration of losing someone. Oh, drama queen. You wanna shatter her heart into thousands of pieces. If it can be more, the better. That's shitty! - Why? - Because it is. - Do you want another beer, Luis? - Yeah, yeah. What about your girlfriend? Oh, no, sweetie, no. I've come with him, but I'm not with him. - Ah. - Ah, yes, but no. Especially, no. What was that? Why did you do it? What? Look, look. Booze. - Hey, dumb-ass. Where were you? - Hey! It's a secret. Don't tell anyone, nobody, not even your pillow. You're my love secret. - No love secrets, okay? - Okay. Hey, cheers. Tell me. How was it? - She called her Mary. - She hates to be called Mary. Order something, Lu. That was my beer. Oh, sorry, Lucy. Here. No, Luis. I want mine. Hello? Berta. Oh, sorry, am I interrupting? Oh, I'm glad you came. - Look. - No! Oh, you didn't have to, but I'm glad you did it. It's our favorite tiramisu. Oh, it looks delicious! How are you doing? I'm good. Working a lot, but I'm good. - And you? - Same. Who would've thought it? Luis is getting married. He is... What? Didn't you think of telling us before? I had to hear somewhere else that you're getting married? Listen, listen, listen. Calm down, please. My mom, she's the traitor's BFF. You can't do that, right, Dad? Berta and I are friends. It has nothing to do with Luis. You never visit your mother, but you visit your ex's! No, no, no. The thing is Berta is a lovely person. It's so weird that she didn't know anything about the wedding. And you told her, didn't you? I didn't know she didn't know. There's something wrong, and you don't believe me. There's nothing wrong here. I was going to tell you. Why wouldn't I? I had prepared a surprise, but I wasn't expecting you to go and give her my tiramisu, Mom. Yeah, she brought me some. I'll save some for you next time. Yeah, save me some. But you know what? Save face, Mariana, if you still have some left. It's a rule. If her son was inside you, you can't be friends, unless he passed away. Do you want me to kill him? No one's killing anyone, dear. Okay. I won't meet with her anymore. Can you tell us about your wedding? Sure! I'm marrying Lucia. Do you remember Lucia, the Colombian girl who came once? You remember her, don't you? - Lu... Lucy? - Lucy. But wasn't she...? Lucy? Why not her? Mom, it happened. She came back, and... we met... - No, we, no. - You fell in love? Exactly. You love each other like we do. How can you love each other after so many years? Well... We just do it. Dear team, we're planning the most important wedding we've ever made. The ex-boyfriend's wedding. For Luis, someone you all know. Obviously I know him better than anyone. Well, maybe his girlfriend or his mom know him more. But I'm in the top five of people who know him the most. I want something original, unseen. Ideas. I have an idea, but I have many questions. Does the dress have to be long and white? Well, does it have to be a dress? That's the spirit. Photos, do we have photo ideas? Flowers? I'm thinking of using marigolds for decoration. And maybe we can throw soil instead of rice to bury the past. I love it. I'm feeling this awesome vibe. Am I the only one? Well, I'll go and fetch the bouquet. - Unleash your imagination. - Come on! What if...? Don Antonio it's lovely. But we're gonna need something less white. Maybe less flowers and more thorns. Something less aerodynamic. With personality. Thanks. For whom is that bouquet? For a friend. What friend? For which friend is that bouquet? - Ale told you, didn't she? - Mariana. Mom, this is serious business. Luis is my client. It's all cool. Well, what do you think about Epi? He looks okay, good. I mean, I barely know him, but I'm glad you're happy. Ah, well, you'll be happier because we'll go dancing. - Sounds good. Have fun. - No, I mean all of us. Epi wants you to come with us because he couldn't get to meet you properly. He wants to get to know you more. - Tonight? - Yeah. Mom, I'm planning a wedding. I can't. I'm very busy. Listen, Mariana. We're in a market. I'm helping you choose a bouquet... - Mariana, you owe me one. - Mom, you're... Perfect, Don Antonio. I love it. Maybe I can put these ones here... Perfect, just what I wanted. Did you call me God? What? You said, "Oh, God!" - Right? - I didn't. - Of course not. - Of course you did. I said your name. But I get you. It was good. No one has ever told me something so sweet. - I'm leaving. - What if I do this? Well, if you excuse me, I'll be right back. So what do you do, Epi? Are we playing now? I'm retired, but now I manage a shelter for dogs with disabilities. Wow! Do you only receive dogs with disabilities? What about the other ones? I mean, they're so many. What are your quirks? Your vices? I don't know. I don't do many things. Yeah, you look boring. I run 6 miles every day. Any other hobby? The usual, cooking, reading, sometimes I smoke a cigar. - This motherfucker is a killer. - Awesome. We have the information that we need. Epi, thank you so much. What do you think about reggaeton? Oh, those musicians are perverts. I knew it, a right-wing bigot. Well, we shouldn't be judgmental, shouldn't we? No, of course not. I'm not a killjoy. If I need reggaeton, I'm into it. So, is the interrogation over? Yeah, Mom. Epi wanted to dance with you. - Oh, great! - Shall we? Shall we? Oh, you fucked it up, Ale. I had cornered him. Cornered him where, Mariana? - Didn't we...? - Ah! Oh, Mom. That's so embarrassing! He's a good dancer, don't you think? Yeah. Oh, they're so cute! LuiCia will be like that during their honeymoon. Only if they can go through the wedding. If they can go through the wedding. This is my favorite part: choosing the type of wedding. We want you to make all decisions together. - Are you ready? - Super ready. More than ready. So, we have to choose the style of the wedding. Knowing Luis's taste, I thought he'd like something like... fantasy themed. Hey, Mariana, don't you think that's a bit silly? Wouldn't it be better something... more... Right, it's a bit old-fashioned, right? Maybe something trendy. - Right? - I know, I know. Something local, more rustic, to honor Lucia's hometown. Oh, no, Mary. It's not a town. It's Bogota, the capital. Let me find other options. No, Mariana, thanks for your suggestions. Let me tell you the wedding we want. Yes. A simple wedding, beers, music. - Yeah, yeah. I remember, Luis. - Fairy lights. - In your restaurant, right? - Noted. So... Poochi. Flowers are fundamental in a love story because they represent the couple's fertility. That's why it's important for you to touch them, smell them, and especially, talk to them. Talk to them! Talk to them! Oh, damn. Okay. Hello? Flower? I'm getting married, flower. So I'd like to invite you to my wedding. Would you like to come? What? Oh, sure, sure. Of course. They want to talk to you, Lu. - Me? - Yeah, they said so. Ah. Dear flower, of course you can come to our wedding. Besides, you can bring your partner! - You can feel the... - Yeah, you can. So now that my buddy Luis is tying the knot, let's delight him with a beautiful song. Yes, sir! Rah! The New Sound Orchestra. You'll never find Someone like me No one who loves you like me Until I die Nobody will love you like me No one to bring The stars and sky for you With beams of passion That's it, you can fall in love But not even a thousand kisses Will put off the eternal fire Burning in your heart You said you found love You lie, you lie, you lie Because I'll always be Part of your life I'm so sorry For your next victim Everything you and I did Life itself transformed you Woman, don't try to erase it You say he treats you well That he has conquered you Your friends have said new love Takes your mind off the old one But let's be serious, Let's be clear Nobody has reached The depths of your soul Closed case You said you found love But you lie, you lie, you lie And you even say you regret Our time together I can see miles away That's not true And now when you talk about me You only pay lip service To your words And upload photos pretending You hold him in one and you dance with him in the other You dance with your friends But I haven't seen anywhere The after party These might look good together, don't you think? Bride? - Let's go. I have to go. - Yes, I know. You only need your love dance. Oh, no, we can do that some other time, Poochi. Bad mood is usual. It happens all the time. I see it every day. No, the thing is we don't have a song yet. What? "The Funeral March," "Bad Decisions," "Not in Love." Poochi. Listen, dumb-ass, you said it'd be just an hour. I can't spend all my day with you. Talk to Ramona. Tell her you're with me. She'll understand. No, no, no, I want to be punctual. I want to be cool, and I like her. Stop fucking around! Yeah, let's wait for her to find out you're engaged, Poochi. Fuck you, Poochi! I'm joking. - Hey! - Hey! Okay, I can't. That's so hot. Shut up! You're an idiot. What? Am I still "Plumber" in your phone? No. Of course not, why are you saying that? I'm sure your sister wants you to go back home. No. Mariana is always super busy with a guy, or with many, in an orgy. I'm so happy for her. Because Luis and Lucia spend all day... Lots of noise. What is it? I was given a scholarship. What scholarship? I applied for a two-year Master's in Vancouver, and they've offered it to me. It's a super, super cool university. That's good. Congratulations. That's good. So, when are you leaving? Soon, very soon. Well, let's celebrate, then. - Cheers. - Cheers. So, can you keep another secret for me, sir? So many secrets with you. My lips are sealed. Are they? How sealed? So, do you get good tips? Now that you mention it, the more they throw up, the better the tips. And they kinda grow fond of you when you look after them while they're drunk and help them with their heartbreaks, so they always come back. Thanks for waiting for me. And miss out on your smile? Hey, but this residence thing is very tricky. You can say you're very Mexican without knowing the national anthem. Actually, I wanted to tell you my method to get the residence. They're vegan. They taste like shit. Some vegan cakes can be amazing. I don't even know why you're doing this. - Hey, Dioni. - Hey. - Where's Luis? - There. Hey, Ale. Hey, Luis's friend. Mary, why are you here? No, no, no, no, the tasting is in two hours. - We said 12. - No, we said 2 p.m. We said 12, Luis. No, I wrote 14. 14 p.m. Okay, since you never read what I text. - I wrote down 14. - It's okay. Hey, we haven't met. I'm Mariana, nice to meet you. Hi, I'm Ramona. I'm... Lucia's best friend. Ah! What's with those desserts? What? Luis? You didn't tell your fiancée? No, it's just that... It was a surprise, right? - It was a surprise. - Surprise. Surprise! Okay, let's do this. - May I help? - Leave it to me. - Just tell me where to go. - Here. So, what do you think? It's very trendy. Vegan, slash, bittersweet, slash, traditional, Mexican. Slash, are there other options? We could go for something more classic. But these ones are awesome because they use the water that's left after cooking the chickpeas, instead of egg. It sounds super healthy. PLUMBER: YOU DENIED ME LIKE PETER TO OUR LORD It has loads of sugar. Can you pass me the spoon? Sure, Lucia's friend. ALE: LUCIA'S FRIEND? LUIS: YOU LOVE TIRAMISU. Could we try my tiramisu? It's an option. Oh, is it? Yeah. I love tiramisu, Mary. You also want tiramisu? Okay. Okay. MARIANA: MY CAKE! HE'S A PSYCHOPATH! You know what? Can we invite your mom? I mean, you know Elena and I have always been like family. - You don't mind, my love? - No, no, Poochi. If it matters to you, it matters to me. Besides, Mary is like a little sister to you now. Mariana. Sure, we can invite her. - No problem. - I'm glad. Well... So, should we try the tiramisu? Oh, you had it already prepared! Let's see. It's so good! It has like an essence... is it orange? Right, exactly. The thing is I was making a tiramisu once and Mariana came, do you remember? She dropped all the orange essence and it tasted amazing. It's funny, don't you think? Sometimes you screw something up and things turn out to be amazing. I mean, it was a cake. It's not "The" tiramisu. Yeah. DIONI: GET REVENGE WITH A KISS. Okay, then. Well, so? The godfather goes for the tiramisu. Yeah, I love tiramisu. I think tiramisu is the best choice because Luis always makes it good. The bride votes for tiramisu. Say no more. We've made a decision. Tiramisu it is. - Sure. - Yes. Do you do this for all the weddings? Yeah, brides love it. I see. And do the grooms come? I mean, Poochi would've loved to come. I know, but I'd like to get to know you more. Luis is my friend, and I care for him. And he's kind of obsessed with weddings so I'm concerned. I don't know. Your face tells me you don't like weddings so much, Mary. You know what? I used to love them, but you eventually find out people get married to pay less for the rent, because their moms forced them, because there's a kid coming, and then I saw myself, every day, trying to persuade these people to love each other. Of course, that happens for those who don't love each other, unlike you and Luis. But they always say they love each other, so how do you know it's serious? That's the point. You don't know. That's a terrible point. Only your dress is missing. Let's go! No! Hey, hold on, wait! - No, this is too tight. - It'll fit you! No, Mary. I was thinking of something simpler. No, but it was original. It was good. Quique, did you use the measurements I sent you? Yeah, of course. Look, this is the most important day of your life. You must look divine. Yeah, but if it doesn't fit, that's it. I mean, a skeleton isn't divine. What can we do? I don't want you to work out to death to get in the dress. Do you have your pills? Of course. Look, take one of these. Maybe you're just retaining water, or it's the normal tummy after eating. - Of course. - What is this? Spirulina and cactus. The worst thing that could happen is over-stimulating your digestion. Then, we get rid of the tummy and the dress will fit you. Let's take those pins. I love taking the brides here. This is where I get to know them better. If they order burritos, they're boring. Beef tacos, they're daddy's girls. And if they hate quesadillas, they're mad. Don't you want some? Some juice? - No, Mary, thanks. - No, no. I'll have another one, please. Thanks. Well, yeah. A papaya and mango drink, please. And... Pork brains quesadilla, please. Thanks. Thanks. Won't you take some for Luis? They're his favorite, you know that? Yeah. Mariana, Luis isn't obsessed with weddings. Luis wanted to get married, but he wanted to marry you. Because he's never loved anyone the way he loved you. And he wanted to celebrate it. That's what weddings are for. Did he say that? Things weren't like that. Well, I feel he really likes me. But what you had was amazing. It was amazing, until he ruined it. Surprise! My love, my mom wanted... Surprise, Lucia, my friend. Ah. Hi, Luis's family. Last time we met, it was... similar. Very similar. I give you this machete as a symbol of Luis's strength throughout his marriage. Use to open a path to your children. Don't be in a hurry, okay? Although, a Luis Jr. or a Lucy wouldn't be so bad. Thanks. I give you this mortar so you can make Luis some spicy salsas and keep the spice in love and have as many children as God wills. Oh, thanks. Are you okay? Yeah, yeah. I give you these tools to fix all the problems in your relationship, and this hammer to destroy the hate, and these nippers... Chook-chook. To keep love together. Thanks, auntie. Thank you. Can you call me auntie? - I'm not feeling well. - Lucy? - Ah! - I'm going with you. I think she's nervous. - Yeah, sure. - Yeah, sure. It's normal. Can I help you with...? - Careful! That's my bag! - Bring toilet paper and a bucket! - Do you need it, girls? - Lucy! Are you okay? Mom! What is it, Mom? I'm getting married. - What? - Wow! - I'm getting married. - Okay, you too. I don't know when, but it's a promise. I asked Epi. I'm glad, Mom. Congratulations. Epi is super cool, and we're happy for you. Right, Mariana? Mom, listen. Can we do an activity? I just need to understand. From 1 to 100, how much do you love Epi? Sweetie, sometimes a 100, sometimes 1. - Love is a journey. - Yes. You decide who will be your passenger. - Epi is the one. - Sure, the one. Like the guy who kicked you out of your apartment? - Girl... - Mariana. Or the guy for whom you left us to move to Reynosa, for how many years, Ale? No, Mariana, I won't be part of this. Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. That's love. You're old enough. Mom, we just want you to be happy. We mean it. Mom, when can we tell you you're fucking it up? Or we're not allowed because you changed our diapers? Don't you see you've done this all your life? You don't know how to be on your own, Mom. You're afraid of commitment. You can't keep a boyfriend. You couldn't keep us! - Girl, stop! - Stop what, Alejandra? If it wasn't for our grandparents, where would we be? On the street, right? Ah! Own up and align your chakras, dear Mariana. Don't call me that! You own up, Mom! You know what? Do whatever you want. But don't expect me to celebrate. I think Mariana wants to be alone, Mom. Let's go. Oh, for fuck's sake! You'll feel better. You'll see. What a mess we made yesterday! Now, let's kill it on the dancefloor. Are you ready? Ah, yes. I've practiced my best moves. No, Luis. I'm not feeling good. Mariana wanted to kill me yesterday with her cactus pills and her wicked hatred. It's just a dance, and it'll be over. No, dude. I don't want to do it. - Ah, you don't want to. - No. You don't want to. I didn't want to clean the mess you left in the bathroom, but I did it. That was part of the deal. Come on, you can piss off later if you want. We say bye. Bye! Come on. What about all the times you threw up in my bar? What about that? - Disgusting. - It's a bar. Okay. He's right. Let's go. No. Luis can talk to Mariana. They can handle it like adults. That's none of your business. Yeah, it is your business. Dancing, especially. - Come. - Listen, Luis. Listen, you know that after the wedding you'll never see her again. Of course, that's the point. Now, we can call it off if you want. Goodbye, wedding. And you go back to Colombia. No. No. - We have the cake figurines. - Right. I can't believe it. You two sound like kids. I thought I could put up with this... but I can't... What? - No, I'm fucking done! - Wait. - What? - Babe! We made a deal. Babe, don't go! I'm sorry. I don't know what's going on. Don't worry. - Hey, sorry. - Finally. Lucia can't come. She's not feeling well. Maybe nervousness. I don't know. Maybe she's getting cold feet. What? No. She's a good person. So, can I see the steps? Then I'll learn them and teach her. - Are they the ones you sent me? - Yeah, the same three steps. - Here's the music. - Let's play it, and then you leave. Yeah. Do it together, please. - What? - Yeah, you two. - Yeah. - Let's go. Our song? - You're fucking kidding me, Luis! - What? - You're fucking kidding me! - It's a song. Okay, let's begin. So, fan... Snake... Chest, chest. Horse riding. Flow, flow. Buddha. Egyptian. - Hold him! - What? Hold him. Okay, here comes the kiss, but well, not now. No. - Yeah, I think... - No. Well, I'll teach Lucia. Don't come, please. So, what do you think? It was good, right? I can picture myself riding the horse in the party. Do you have any plans? I'd like you to taste the wedding's menu. So we'd have to go to the restaurant. But I don't know if you want... can... - Sure. - Sounds good? Thanks, but Ale is waiting for me. Guess what? My mom is getting married again. No. It's okay, don't worry. You have a more important wedding at the moment. No problem, I understand. Okay, let's go. Yeah, let's go. Oh, fuck! It's... There. Almost there. Here we are. Please, come in. As you can see, I haven't done much. Except for the menu, of course. But the rest still needs your help. I couldn't give it any other name. Right? Don't be so full of yourself, but this fucking muffin tastes so good. Why? You can't say a tiramisu is a muffin. No. Forgive me, forgive me, please. Enlighten me with your bakery knowledge. Because you studied in...? Where did you study? In Paris? Oui, Oui. - Where? - Je studied at the "bakerie," - Oui, Oui. - The "cakerie..." Oui, Oui. Thanks. Thanks for planning my wedding. For dancing with me. For this. Thanks. Let's toast to the... to your restaurant, which I'm sure will be a success. Not as much as if it were our restaurant. But cheers. Cheers. Your mom is getting married, right? Again. Why can't she be like your parents? How have they managed to love each other for years? I have no idea. I've wondered that so many times. I have no idea. I'm scared, that my life will turn into this. My mom fails, Ale fails, I fail. We hold each other. Was it that? - It was that, wasn't it? - Luis. Do you want more tiramisu? Luis. What? Where are they? Where are my clothes? Wait, Mariana. - Hey, I think... - Here, wear this. I think... I should go, Luis. - Why? - What do you mean "why"? No. Okay, wait. Please, wait. Wait, Mariana. - Listen, please. - I want to go! Listen! Lucia and I... Oh, don't mention Lucia now. Please, Luis. I don't love Lucia! I'll call off the wedding with her and marry you. You didn't get a thing, right, Luis? What didn't I get? Weren't you going to dance our song in your wedding? Are you a psycho? Or what, Luis? - Excuse me? A psycho? - Yes. May I remind you who thought of planning this whole wedding thing? Psycho? Of course I wanted to dance my song, - Your song? - In the wedding only I wanted. - It was our song, Luis. - Only I wanted it! Our song and my wedding, by myself. Perfect, if our song works for your plan B, dance our song with your plan B. How do you know you weren't my plan B? Luis, you only want to marry anyone. - No matter what. - With you. I didn't want to get married, and you knew it, and you asked me and fucked it up. - That's clear. - And fucked up everything we had. But you know what? I left you the restaurant. - Ah, you left me the restaurant? - Yes. - Thanks. - Life goes on, get married! I'm getting married. I'm getting married. Get married and have your fucking wedding! Sure, thank you very much. Fuck! Ah, I'm so stupid! Oh, shit! Hey, Ma'am, Miss, Mariana. How was your dance? Hey, Dioni. Nice to see you. Okay. You should go. There's a crisis. Goodbye, gorgeous. I don't care if he's your boyfriend, but why are you hiding him? I'm not hiding him. Sometimes I don't tell you things because, as always, your problems are priority. There are more things you need to tell me, besides you dating him. I'm not dating him. I just hate your lectures. - Okay. - Okay. I just think your life hasn't been good lately. Oh, fuck! You're fucking kidding me, Mariana! Are you serious? It's great, isn't it? It's great that I'm always the one with issues. My life is perfect. I don't have issues. You're the one with the issues. You're the one planning a wedding for an asshole who's over you! He's over you, Mariana! If you're so sure, why are you living in my house? Ah, I'm glad we're thinking the same. - I'm leaving. - Go on! I'm leaving. You know what? I hope you're happy because I'm leaving far, far away for a while. That sounds perfect. What...? Shit, did you get the scholarship? Ale! I don't understand him. I don't understand Ale. I don't understand my mom. I don't get why everyone is against me now. Then she said it's her house. Then why did she let me stay? - Well, Ale, I think... - What's next, Mom? I can't eat there? I can't shower? What? She kicked me out, as if I was undesired. And if I know something, if I'm sure about something, it's that I'm a very desired person. I hate them! I hate them! I hate her! I hate her! I don't, you know? No. No, from now on, Mariana is over. It's done. It's over. You were right. This is the cleverest shit I've ever done. I met the true Mariana, and I don't want her. You're right. What is it? Did you fix your thing with Ramona? No, she left me. I liked that girl. And I think she liked me too. But well, I have priorities. Don't tell me it was my fault. Yeah, basically, buddy. It is complicated to show someone you love them when you're marrying somebody else. But well, this will be over in two days. Cheers. Are you okay? Ale will be in charge of the flowers and the DJ will be here at ten to set everything up. The judge will be here at six, and Luis will bring the tiramisu. Girl, why did you give him the ring back? Because I never wanted to get married, and he knew it. I was never sure, and then I saw myself, standing there like an idiot, in the middle of everything he was arranging. And what did you want? I didn't want to suffer, and I didn't want him to suffer either. Ah, that's good, then. So good, because you know what? Right now, none of you is suffering. Great, you made a great decision. Mariana, from all the people who come here, imagine about... how many do you think are sure they want to get married? I don't know. Not even one. But what's our job? Make them believe they love each other and charge them a lot of money? Listen, darling, nobody knows if they'll be happy in the future. And that's okay, right? Let people believe they can be happy. No. Sorry, I didn't want to hurt you this way. It wasn't my intention... To get this far. That's why I'm here, before you, my best friend, well, before you two. Now you'll taste the most romantic, most delicious meal I've made. But first, some wine of forgiveness. To forgive each other. Ramona, I've never seen Lucia so happy with someone. I mean it. This was all my fault. I started this mess and now I'm doing it for her own happiness. Yeah, I did it for our happiness. For our possible future. I mean, possible, not certain, but possible. But still you're getting married. Yeah, but we're ending this on the weekend, right, Luis? Absolutely. That's right! You didn't even try the wine of forgiveness. Thanks, Luis. If you need a bartender, call me. No, actually, if you need a cook, let me know, because I need to sell this place. Just like that, Luis? This was your dream. No, it was our dream. Mariana's and mine. I can't do it on my own. This is yours. Thank you. Bon appétit. Are you ready for your trip? So should we break up officially? We never dated officially. Of course. This makes things simpler, right? Did you tell Luis about me? No. See? There you go. Everything was good and... What's happening to us? So awkward. Not everything was so awkward, was it? Not so much. Ale, what if we hang out until you leave? I can help you pack a few canned peppers, sauces, frozen tortillas. Do you want flowers? I can run after the plane, and that's it, you live happily ever after. No, I mean, the plane thing was a joke. I know it's not possible. I'm leaving. See you sometime. Well, goodbye. I liked us being each other's secret. Thank you. Will you forgive me? What I told you wasn't cool, and wasn't my intention. It's just that... I don't know what I want. You know. You don't want to be afraid. You're never afraid. Where were you? What if I get too cold? What if I miss my tortillas and screw everything up? And you can't do anything without me. This girl... Hi. Hi, sister. I'm sorry, sister. Forgive me. Oh, I'm gonna miss you so much. These are some of the weddings we've planned, and this one, this one, this one, and this one ended up in a divorce. I don't want Luis to go through that. I've never understood why I do this for a living. I think I used to think I could understand the couples, their love, and so I could plan the perfect wedding for them, but the truth is I can't. For that reason, this will be my last wedding. It's amazing, Mariana. You also deserve happiness. Let's sign it, and it's over. Luis, are you sure you want me to keep the rings? I'm very nervous about keeping them. Why me? Relax, breathe. You're the godfather. Look how beautiful she looks. What? But that's not the dress. No way. Is that the dress? What do you mean, Luis? A white dress, the wedding. Fucking Mariana! Hey. There was a mistake. My sister is sending you this. - Ah! - Uh, no. No, you know what? This one kinda grew on me. I feel fantastic. Okay, sounds good. Babe. Attention, everyone. I need to make a confession. I've been having consensual and affective sexual intercourse with Alejandra. Dioni. And these were the most beautiful weeks of my life. But well, Ale is in a very important mission. I'll treasure the memories of this sweet love that grew between us. - I love you. - I love you too. There's no time to waste. Hey? My best friend is getting married. Congratulations! Thank you. Good evening to the newlyweds, their family and friends. We're about to start the ceremony to legally bind you, Lucia and Luis. Are you doing this of your own free will, Luis and Lucia? LuiCia. Do you wish to get married today? - That's right. - Good. Please, bring the rings. Oh, of course. Oh, no! Ah! Here. Before continuing the ceremony I have to ask does anyone here oppose to the union of these two people? All right. Let's proceed to the ring exchange. In the end you realize the only thing that matters are the smiles, the moments you share, the support you give each other. Please. When you find true love, you have no option but to take a leap and scream... I love you. Oh, no. Please, follow me, sir, your Majesty. We trust blindly in this country's laws. - Come on, quick! - What did I just say? Mariana what did you do? What are you saying? - What did you say? - Nothing. Nothing. No, don't give me that look. It's okay. It's all cool. - What did you say? - I just want you to be happy. What did you say? Lucia? Take care of him. Well, I was on my way out. I'm leaving. I love you, Ale. I love you, Mom. I love you, Luis's aunt. I love you, Luis. I'm leaving. Yes. No, Mariana, hold on. I love you, Lucia. What? What's going on? I fucked it up from the very beginning. What do you mean you fucked it up? You were wrong. - Yeah, I... - Oh, no. I knew it. - I wanted to annoy you. - You're a psycho liar. - Yes, I'm a psycho, a liar, - What's wrong with you? And asshole. Yes. - You made a huge mess. - I'm an asshole, an asshole. But I love you. I love you. - Sorry. - Yes. I love you, Mariana, so much. Me too. - I still don't want to get married. - That's okay. I don't want to live thinking that the best day of our lives has passed. No, nobody wants to get married. Who wants to get married? Do I want to get married? No. You should've thought about that before doing this. I'm sorry. The best days of our lives... can they happen anytime in the future? Every day. Can we start today? Okay, yes. Besides, if we don't get married, we can't get a divorce. Oh, shut up! Dear, beautiful audience, give it up for the newlyweds. Oh, I mean, I mean, the couples, the girlfriends, the lifetime lovers. Damn! What a night! What a night! H-H-H-He-Hey. This is D-D-D-D-J Dioni, livening up the best parties. Now I'm gonna leave you with a hit to warm things up, yes, sir. It's not bad to be your plan B. Really? Not bad, right? What now? Now we need certificates, buying tables, chairs, lights, and go into a shit ton of debt. Well, in the meantime... Tiramisu? Forever.
