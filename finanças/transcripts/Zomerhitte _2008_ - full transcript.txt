SUMMER HEAT I don't want you to leave. I have to. Do you love me? -Of course. Say it then. What? That you love me. Stop it. See, you're not saying it. What are you doing? Come. -No, let's get out of here. Come. 14 MONTHS LATER Have you been taking pictures of me? No, I forgot to press the button. Too late. -Stupid. Are you a professional? Yes. Then it's even more stupid. I could kill myself. What are you doing here? I take pictures for National Geographic. Of naked women? No, of the flora and fauna of the island. And of mirages. -Mirages? Yes, it happens in hot weather, like now. Suddenly you see an island floating over the ocean. This is a nude beach, you know. And clothes aren't allowed. Just like walking nude in the street. You're the first woman who forces me to undress. Bastard, you did press the button. That was an accident. I couldn't get my finger off the button. Can I delete them? -Why? You can take new pictures of me. Alright. Stand up. Only a portrait. Ok. This is a nude beach, you know. What do you do? I'm a history student. When was the Battle of Hastings? 1066. Are you on holiday here? No, I work in the disco. Holiday job. Where are you from? From the sea. And you'll return to the sea. -Yes. One of you. One. You must have modelled before. I bet you say that to everybody. No. I'm late for work. What's your name? Kathleen. -Bob. Have you got an address I can send the pictures to? -No. What's the name of the bar where you work? The Panting Deer. See you later. -Who knows. You shaved. -Yes. For me. -Of course. What would you like? -A whisky. Can I have a malt whisky on the house? Thanks. Your photo. -That's fast. Cool. Look. Would you like to have dinner tonight... Look. He took it. We're having a drink on Klaas' boat. Are you coming? I have to work. -Don't. I'll pay you anyway. I've got to do something. Those photos. -What? Those nude pictures. Whose? I don't have them anymore. -Give them to me. I deleted them. -How much do you want for them? They don't exist anymore. If you're screwing with me... I wouldn't like that. Don't you like screwing? Don't you want to dance? -No, thanks. My ex doesn't like to dance. It's not the only thing he doesn't like. What are you doing on the island? I'm a photographer. For a porn magazine? -No. Birds. The love life of birds is very interesting. Shall I give you a hand job in the toilet? That would be the third time today, so I'm taking a break. Those gross little salads do that. People can't taste anything anymore. So they can't taste each other's puke anymore. And then there's the booze and the pills. Can I introduce myself? Frederico Federici. Bob Griffioen. -Waiting for someone? Yes. Be careful. They're sluts here. Just now, one wanted to give me a hand job in the toilet. Tomorrow, everything will be clean again. The seagulls eat all the puke. Even the condoms, apparently. Is that her? -Do you know her? Such a beautiful woman. A rare beauty. Good luck. Get lost, you. Did you see any mirages? No, I didn't. I saw a jellyfish. Take a picture of it. It has a little fish inside. Where's your camera? At home. -Let's get it. Where do you live? Something smells bad. Shit, the morels. That was for last night. I wanted to... -Poison me? No, it's a delicacy. But you'd rather go with that old guy. We didn't have a date, did we? Do you always need dates? -No, things go the way they go. Beautiful. The Battle of Hastings... Do you know the Bayeux Tapestry? Only from reproductions. I did a shoot about it. Do you know what the battle was about? Yes, King Harold against William the Conqueror. Here, King Harold dies. He gets an arrow in his eye. How do you know that old piece of parchment? Why do you want to know so much? It's not good. Do you have a relationship with him? You don't beat around the bush. -No. No. What no? -I don't have a relationship with him. I sometimes masturbate for him. That turns him on. Why do you do that? He can't come anymore and I can. Do you come for him? -Of course not. But I can fake it. Does he pay you for it? Sometimes he gives me 500. It gives you power over a man without him getting power over you. And you don't get any scary diseases. Do you do it for others too? You mean for you? Coffee? -Please. Not too close. Sit down. And now I'd like a drink. Do I have to pay too now? No, dick, this was different. Next time, I want to photograph you. Who says there'll be a next time? To the next time. And now you're going to do it for that old corpse. You're not jealous, are you? -No, curious. Imagine you're looking at a beautiful nude painting. Next to you is someone who's also looking at the painting. You wouldn't be jealous, would you? Maybe that's the difference between a nude painting and a real human being. Am I interrupting? No. How did you find me? You have to be able to handle solitude here. Had a woman visiting? Why? Lipstick. Are you with the police? She's so beautiful. A mask full of mystery. What's hidden is always the most attractive. You take really good pictures. The old lady loved photography. -The old lady? Is it her lipstick? -Yes. With pictures like this, something will happen between model and photographer. Who was the old lady? She was a very rich old lady. I'd drive her anywhere in her Rolls Royce. The Uffizi in Florence, the Prado in Madrid. We didn't miss any museums. She taught me to look. Can I buy this one from you? -I don't sell any pictures. A pity. What happened to the old lady? She died a couple of years ago. Her son inherited everything. He even took the Rolls Royce from me. Wait, look. This is in the Prado in Madrid. I adored her. Are you sure I can't buy it? -Yes. Nice talking to you. And say hello to your girlfriend. Who's the old man she's seeing? She'd better not see him. Sir. This is a nature reserve. You're not allowed here. There are birds breeding. I take pictures for National Geographic. Very beautiful. But you're still not allowed here. Do you know where I can find a breeding short-eared owl? Short-eared owls are beautiful birds. They're rare these days. Careful. They're as shy as virgins with pimples, as they say on the island. What do you know about virgins with pimples? They come in large numbers from the mainland. There was a nest there, last week. With four eggs. Look. Can you tell me what happened? He was attacked by an owl. Jesus. Bob? Robert here. -Yes. How are your pictures going? -Fine. The deadline is on Monday, next week. -Yes. Will the pictures be good? -Yes, beautiful. I just took a picture of an owl taking out someone's eye. Why are you here? -No reason. Who invited you? I want to talk to you. Here. -Did you hear about the park ranger? Yes, terrible. I was there. I'll get you a drink. When is it coming? Tomorrow. -Ok, see you then. This is the last time I'm helping you. I won't need any help after tomorrow. Bob? I hope I've been clear. What are you doing here? I was invited? -By who? Kathleen. -Keep your filthy hands off her. What's he doing here? -He says he was invited by Kathleen. Can you swim? Fuck you. Come here. You look like you've met the devil. Where have you been? Here. At Klaas' goodbye party. Another one, please. Was the mummy there too? They threw me overboard. Bunch of assholes. I'll get them back. -Better be careful. Another one for him. Where did you go last night? I was thrown overboard by your buddies. By Richard and Dennis? -Did you tell them I was there? No, I went to get you a drink. Why are you here? -Want to go for a run? Ok, let's go. Do you go for runs often? It's been a while. Can I use your bathroom? Gives you time to stretch. Bob, you're nominated for the Silver Camera. Congratulations! Robert. Is that your girlfriend? Who? -In the picture. Are you a well-known photographer? I don't know that scene at all. Fairly. It's a small group. Sorry, I... -Yes, me too. It's so hot. Are you alright? -Yes. Are you sure? -Yes. Look at that. And that? That's a pup. Poor thing. Look. It's exhausted. -The fighter jets scare them to death. They must be its parents. No, they're two females. Males don't get involved. That's great. You're late. Get in. We were saving a seal. Keep your fucking hands off her. -Wow, he speaks English. Stop it. Touch me one more time... -Stop it. Get in. Do you love birdies too? I wouldn't worry about what I love. He speaks in whole sentences. Kathleen, Richard, get in. Nice friends. One moment. For the family album. He doesn't want you to take pictures. Kathleen! Get out. Get up. Go. Walk. Drive. One wrong move and I'll blow your head off. Where are we going? -You know very well. Where are the backpacks? -Backpacks? Don't fuck around, jerk. You're the only one who was in the area. -I don't know what you're on about. Get out. Walk. -Where? Walk. Don't try anything. Where are they? No idea. Get up. Get up. I thought you could use some help. And then? -I showed him where the backpacks were. And he just let you go? -No, I got away. How? I was standing on a little hill. That's where I hid them. I pulled out the first backpack. It weighed around 30 kilos. Times two. That's a street value of a couple of million. I threw the backpack at him, making him lose his balance. He fell in the bushes and I ran off. You should be happy he didn't shoot you. He was just trying to get to his car. I think you've been very lucky. Yes. Why didn't you go to the police right away? They would have arrested Kathleen as well. So you sacrificed yourself for love? I don't fall in love anymore. Better be careful with that girl. Rather than play the hero. They might end up killing you because you know too much. Can I come in? Did your boss send you to interrogate me and then kill me? Not even a pair of nail scissors. I don't even know how to use a weapon. Why are you here? I'm here to warn you. Things have disappeared and they're furious. Yes, heroin. How do you know? I know what heroin looks like. Return that stuff. They could do anything. You hang out with some nice people. It's of no use to you. You won't get off the island with it. I don't want that rubbish. You can fuck me if you'll tell me exactly what happened. I'll tell you first and then we'll see. Sorry, your boyfriend broke all my glasses. He's not my boyfriend. What is he then? Your dealer. -I don't use. Where's Richard? He split. His car's still there. -He took another car. With German licence plates and a stranger behind the wheel. You're lying. I think he ripped you off. He'd never do that. And why didn't he... -Liquidate me? Go tell the dirty old man he lost his money. Is that your girlfriend? Can you please leave? No. How much does he pay you for it? -For what? To get me into bed. Jesus, man, don't be so difficult. You don't have to do this. I've already told you everything. Asshole. Is it because of your girlfriend? None of your business. -Where is she now? Can you leave now? Sore spot? -Get out. Jesus, you're a... -Get lost! Here, your bag. Do you enjoy making me look like a fool? Who's making who look like a fool? You have no idea, do you? If you only knew. What? -Never mind. Tonight, the winners of the Silver Camera were announced. This prestigious photography prize was awarded for the 60th time this year. Dutch photographer Bob Griffioen won the award. The jury calls him one of the most promising photographers. The winning picture shows the moment when the photographer and... his girlfriend drive into an ambush in the Afghan desert. During this incident, Griffioen's girlfriend died. The jury calls this picture fascinating and touching... and describes its composition as extremely exact. Who is it? -Me. Why are you here? -To apologise. And to congratulate you. I'm unarmed. You can frisk me. Thank you. Don't you like me? I don't know who you are. I'm Kathleen. My father died when I was two. My mother lives in a hippy commune in India. For 4 years, I've had a relationship with a bossy old fart... who thought he was my father. Or so did I. I left all that behind me. And now I'm here. What do you want? -You. I don't believe you. You work for that old guy. He can drop dead. I didn't know it was all about heroin. No? -No, really. And now? Now I'm here. I don't want anything from you. Just to have a good time with you. A good time? -I thought you'd frisk me. Everywhere? -Yes, everywhere. Turn around. I can't find anything. Put your arms up. When you come, I'll bite your neck. Sorry. My father died when he was 27. Young. -Yes. Of what? An artery in his head burst. Exactly here. It's hereditary. It can happen. How old are you now? 27. -Have you had it checked out? That's useless. Why? They won't find anything anyway. Aren't you afraid? What's the point? How long until you're 28? 7 months, 3 days, 11 hours and 17 minutes. I was taking pictures for Unicef. She worked there. It was our last day together. Did you love her? I think so. -You think so? How long has it been? A bit over a year. Terrible. You're the first person I've told. And after her? Nobody. So all that time... -What? Never? -No. So this was the first time? We have to celebrate that. Do you know where Kathleen lives? Relax. Sit down. What's going on? I had a gun. -Yes, I know, in your pocket. So you didn't believe my story? -No way. A drink? Coffee, please. I tied the backpack to him. I pushed him into the water. He sank right away. Are you sure nobody knows about this? Did Kathleen believe your story? -Yes. But not anymore. -No. If you show the gun to the mummy, you're dead. Yes. Do you realise the danger you're in? -Yes. 22 Langerwaal. You'd better hurry. What did you do with my gun? -I threw it out. You threw it out? -It's evidence. Evidence of what? -What do you think the mummy will do... Come in. It was all only a trick to spy on me. That's not true. And the story about your father? Was that a lie too? I told you things I've never told anybody else. But you're just using me. -That's not true. Why did you steal the gun then? -To protect you. How did you get that gun? He dropped it when he ran off. Let's stop this. -Why? How can we ever trust each other? I trust you. I don't trust you. But what about last night? One big lie. Where are you going? Away. It's over between us. What about me? Robert. -I'm returning the job. I'm quitting. What about National Geographic? Fuck National Geographic. You can't do that. -Yes, I can. Easily. And what will you do now? Take something to the police and get off this fucking island. Where's Richard? -I haven't got a fucking idea. Where's the stuff? -I don't know. Stop it. We don't know anything. Who does know? -We don't know anything. Klaas speaking. You have an hour and that's it. Bob says he left in the sports car. -Who was driving then? I don't know. Some German. He doesn't know anybody. How can he suddenly have someone helping him? How do I know? Why would he do something like this? Money? How much is it worth? Four million. Half of it is Klaas'. He'll kill me. Come. Can I do anything for you? Then I'll go. Stand over there. -No. Please. Take that off. I want to see you. No. -Please. No. I'm begging you. No. Let me see you. Play with yourself. No. -Kathleen. I don't want it anymore. Play with yourself, damnit! It's Klaas. Kathleen! He shot himself through the head. Did you touch anything? We have to get off this island. It's Klaas' bodyguard. Is he gone? -Yes. Get everything you need and make sure everything looks normal. It can't look as if you left your room in a hurry. Where are we going? I don't even have a house. What time does the last boat leave? -Nine o'clock. We'll make that. I'll be right back. The rain might wipe all your traces out. I've come to say goodbye. Are you leaving? -I'm going to Paris. Do you know the Nike of Samothrace? -Yes. The goddess of victory. A beautiful female figure, arising from a pupa like a butterfly. By the way, can I have your address? Maybe I'll send you a postcard. And how did you go? The mummy shot himself through the head. Kathleen was there. Did you see it? No. So she could have done it too. I trust her. At least he's dead. You seem relieved. -I didn't like him much. How did you know the mummy? Did I never tell you? He's the old lady's son. He took the entire inheritance. Kathleen? Not a sound. Where's Richard? He took off. Where are the backpacks? -He took them. You're lying. -No. Where's the stuff? -I don't know. He doesn't know and neither do I. He took off. Alright, I'll tell you where it is. We have to go to the dunes. What? Tie your boyfriend up. You said you didn't have it. Yes, that's what I said. Shall we go? The other way. My coat. I can't go out like this. Are we ready, princess? No funny stuff. It would be your last time. I wouldn't do it if you want me to tell you anything. Where are we going? To the last parking. Why did you lie to me? You'll find out. -Jesus, you're an asshole. As if you're behaving that well. Nice atmosphere. Where is it? -In a lake in the dunes. On Richard's belly. -Is he dead? You killed him. -No, I swear. Right, I believe you right away. Look ahead. It's here. Where? In the water. Get it out. Untie me. Turn around. Back. A waste. -I've got more of them. Don't get any ideas or I'll shoot. Shut up. He was carrying a backpack. You're talking bullshit. -I'm sure. There was another one. Damn! -There was another one in the water. I'm certain. Tell me where it is or I'll shoot her. Tell him where it is! -I don't know. I don't know. For the last time. Where's the stuff? Where's the stuff. I'll shoot! I'll tell you. The truth this time. -Oh, now we'll get the truth. Now we'll get the truth. Three. Don't move! Get up! Get up! Walk. Against that tree. Hands together. Shut up! Go. Asshole! You said you threw the gun out. -A good thing I didn't. It saved our lives. -You lied to me. Look who's talking. -You... Are you alright? Where's the stuff? I don't know. Believe me. Shit, that was the last boat. We have to get off this island. -Why don't we go to the police? We'll be dead before they do anything. What's wrong? This is it. Hospital, quickly. Kathleen? A cerebral infarction. Near De Punt. Kathleen. Stay with me. Please. It's not true what I said. I can't... I can't live without you. I love you. Do you hear? I love you. I love you too. Did you fake it all? -Didn't we have to get off the island? I was worried sick. So I heard. Sweet of you. How can I ever believe you again? Or I you. I still have the gun. Me too. Why did you say you threw the gun out? I was going to, but then I thought I might need it. But not anymore? No. Why did you lie about Richard? I couldn't tell you. -Why not? I didn't know whose side you were on. And now you do? Yes. 7 months, 1 day, 3 hours and 17 minutes later Bob, are you coming? Good morning. -Good morning. I'm looking for Bob Griffioen. With kind regards from my boss, Frederico Federici. Goodbye. -Goodbye. Thanks. I wonder what's in it. Maybe a bomb. See I didn't lie? Did I ever tell you how much I love you? No. I love you very much. -What did you say? I love you very much. I love you too. Good night. -Good night. Can you do it one more time for me? Bob. Go on.
