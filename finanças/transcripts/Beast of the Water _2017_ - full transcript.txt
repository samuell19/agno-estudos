I'm afraid that the next species to fall victim to extinction will be aging professors. [chuckles] Okay, let's come at this from a different direction. The stories surrounding the Ininkwe people are those legends, myths, monsters and folklore. Some scholars argue the validity of their very existence, and that, of course, is attributed to the fact that there's very little evidence that indicates they ever did. However, three hours south of this university is the place where we believe, the Ininkwe made home, and for the past two decades, I have researched and studied this area for signs, evidence. Have you ever found any? Evidence, I mean. Uh, not much. Materially, anyway. However, science has given us some answers... Answers that have led to other questions, but answers nonetheless. This indigenous tribe was on the verge of becoming a flourishing civilization. They were in many ways advanced and believed that the land endorsed their existence, and they also believed that their youth would be replenished by [speaking foreign language] Which translates to "magic waters." Now, unfortunately, much like the Mayans, the Ininkwe people disappeared without a trace, a whole tribe gone, almost forgotten. Scholars have been arguing a few years over what could have caused the disappearance of yet another thriving people. I would like to hear some of your theories. What about you, Mike? Uh, my guess would be aliens. [everybody laughing] Well, it's nice to see you all are still awake. Uh, actually, many scholars would argue that Mike is correct. Not aliens from outer space per se, but foreign invasion, forced removal. Mass genocide. These living waters, are they anything like the Fountain of Youth? It is indeed. Isn't the Fountain of Youth bullshit? [everybody chuckling] Some people think so. What do you believe, Dr. Grey? I believe in possibilities. Okay, that's all I have for you today. Try to get through Calloway by Monday. [video chat ringtone sound] Hello, Monica. Good morning, Walter. How was your class this morning? Oh, like any other day, although I don't think anyone fell asleep today. [laughing] It sounds riveting. [Dr. Grey] It was. How are you? I'm great. I wanted to let you know that I may have some good news soon. Riley called this morning to say that he found something interesting in the samples that you brought back from site three. Oh, did he mention what? Not yet but I'm heading over to the lab soon. Well, let's hope it's something solid. The days are coming to an end, we could sure use it. Have you heard anything about the grant? No, still nothing. [Monica] Well, don't lose hope. Never. We're close. I'm just not sure how much longer our funding is gonna hold up. The board is becoming impatient. I believe in what we're doing. [Dr. Grey] I know you do. How is Alan? Alan is... fine, I'm sure. There must be a story in those pauses. Alan and I decided to keep things simple. Ah, I had a feeling that might be the case. Not that it's any of my business, but don't wait until you become my age before realizing what could have been. I know real when I see it. I'll keep that in mind. Do let me know what Riley discovered in the lab. [Monica] Will do. Okay, take care. Bye, Walter. [suspenseful music] [gurgling sound] Riley, how is this happening? I have no idea. Are these all from the same sample? Yes, 3D7. It's one of the samples Dr. Grey brought back from his expedition in the forest. But even if they were from different samples, Monica, the molecules would average out. They would all reach one pH and that would be relatively stable. Where did it finish up? The most acidic reading I got was 2.71, and the most basic was 15.66. But that's... Impossible, I know. Okay, well what impurities did you find in the sample? That's the other thing, not one. It's pure H2O, chemically speaking at least. No bacteria, no algae, no particulates of any kind. It's remarkable really. Not only is it remarkable, it's impossible, chemically at least. I mean, coming from a source out in the woods, all of the other collections were their own little ecosystems. What about the other samples in the lot? Only 3D7 reacted this way. We have to tell Dr. Grey about this. He may have actually found his legendary Ininkwe, Fountain of Youth. So, we are in possession of 60 milliliters of magic lightning in a bottle? Wherever he got this sample, we need to duplicate these results. If we can do that, it'll change everything we know about science. Help me understand your story. [tribal music] [door opens] Been at it all night again, huh? I'm afraid so. [Monica] Well, we've got good news for you. I could use it. Come in, come in. Hi, Walter. Hi. Afternoon, Dr. Grey. She calls me Walter, you can call me Walter. I'll try, it just feels a little weird. Because I'm old? No, no, no, no, it's just because you're... Old! [everybody laughing] It's okay. I may look old, but I'm happy because I've done a much better job of wasting my youth than you are. Young Riley, good to see you. - Hi, Dr. Grey. - Hello. Walter, Riley's... I was just about to make lunch, who's hungry? I could eat. What made you test the pH of the water in the first place? Oh, that's just a standard test. We pop an acidity meter in every sample before we put it under the microscope, and when the needle didn't rest on number but it kept fluctuating, I thought something was wrong with the equipment. I'm so glad that's not what it was. We did a litmus test and then another, and this is what we found. Amazing. Most of the biggest scientific discoveries happen by accident. This is no accident. Look, I'm sure you're all aware that I go before the university research board tomorrow hat in hand to extend our study grant. Once they understand the potential of this discovery, they can't say no, because, well, we've never seen anything like this Walter, ever. I just hope they'll listen. [Dr. Grey] Respectfully, ladies and gentlemen, this is a big mistake. There is new research... We are sorry to say, Dr. Grey. We simply do not see the need for these anthropological expeditions of yours anymore. My colleagues Dr. Williams and Dr. Warner just yesterday gave me... Dr. Grey, you have yet to show any real improvements with your research. We had such high hopes. Those high hopes are on the verge of being realized, if you would just look at the data. Too much time has passed, too much money wasted. The Ininkwe legends tell of them harnessing healing water. This could be a great find for Humanity. Our decision stands. [suspenseful music] They just do not understand, do they, Dr. Grey? Perhaps it's time we continued our conversation? Anya Anderson, Director of Intellectual Property Acquisition for AESIV. We're prepared to begin as soon as you say the word. [sighs] Well, that was a waste. Well, it's not how I hoped it would happen, but here's to the next step forward. A toast to the Ininkwe, to finding the secret of the living water, to the betterment of mankind, to life. [all] To life. It feels kind of lame toasting with soda. After your next birthday, we'll blow it out. Promise. I was approached by AESIV several years back. At the time, they were strictly a biotech pharma concern. They wanted to fund my anthropological research hoping that the legendary living waters of the Ininkwe were rich in minerals that they could make into cosmetics or tonics or drugs to fight disease. This is so exciting. We're gonna change the world. You've all signed your contracts. So, while we're waiting for AESIV to set up your lab, you all are welcome to make yourselves at home here, come and go as you please, "mi casa es su casa". Are you sure you want to go back up there by yourself? I won't be by myself. I'm meeting a team at AESIV headquarters who will escort me to the site and service my assistance in gathering more samples from site 2. Site 2? I thought you said you ruled out site 2. I have but they don't know that. I promise I will ditch my companions and come back with a nice large sample from 3D7, but I'm still feeling out our friends that I serve. I mean, we've all been a team for a while. I would trust you three with my life. AESIV, well, I'm just being cautious. [Dr. Grey] AESIV's last annual report reveals a very different company. They've diversified. Genetic engineering, petrochemicals, and avionics. It seems like nowadays, if it can be weaponized, AESIV has little interest. Weaponized? I just think we have to be very sure of what we're dealing with before we share any of our findings with our new employers. I mean, this is like an amateur athlete getting a corporate sponsor, and they want us to succeed, don't they? Well, of course they do. The question is why? [Monica] In this area, it goes well below freezing in the winter, and about 35 degrees Celsius midsummer. So, I think it's important to see if the changes in weather has any effect on the rate of pH mutation. We're gonna need to get some high-quality electron microscopes as soon as we get back to AESIV labs so we can see what's really going on at the atomic level with these molecules. [video chat ringtone sound] Hey, it's Dr. Grey. [whispering] Hello. Monica? Hi, Walter. How are you? The trip is good for the soul, but hell on my knees. How are you all? Settling in? Yeah, we're all doing great here. It's like a study session back in undergrad. I'm crunching data, and Monica and Riley are planning experiments. Hi, Dr. Grey! Well, listen, I can't talk long. I've got something extraordinary to show you. [whispering] I found this. Is that what I think it is, Walter? An intact artifact? [whispering] Whole and perfect. What a find. [whispering] I think it's all coming together, weird science and our first solid tangible evidence of the Ininkwe people. This totem was described by the Cherokee, but we've never found one. So this links the Living Waters and the Ininkwe settlements' as history, not legend. That's one step closer to the Fountain of Youth. [whispering] We're close to all of it. You understand? [pounding] Walter? [whispering] Past the waterfall, west of the mirror, beneath where history becomes legend. [normal voice] Yes, the weather seems to be turning bad on our end here today. [whispering] I've already said too much. [normal voice] I'll see you in a couple of days. [whispering] Take care. He found it. He really found it. I mean, he's got to be so excited. [laughs] Yeah, but did he look okay to you? With all this cloak-and-dagger evasive... I don't know. Well, look, you trust him, right? Of course, I trust him. I wouldn't be who or where I am if it wasn't for Walter. Well, if you trust him, trust him. It just seems like he was trying to say something else. What did he mean by "the mirror?" I don't know. I've been trying to figure out Walter Grey riddles for 15 years. He's... Eccentric? Let me go see if he left anything in his office about it. Alan? I have a bad feeling. [doorbell rings] Did you guys order a pizza? Can I help you? Hello. ♪♪♪ Dr. Williams, I'm Anya Anderson, AESIV's Director of Intellectual Property Acquisition. What can we do for you, Ms. Anderson? And what's with the entourage? Oh, that's an AESIV corporate security detail. They're highly trained experts specialized in the protection of AESIV's personnel. We don't need a security detail. We're not in any danger? No. Of course you're not. But just like Dr. Grey, you'll be going up to the Ininkwe site, and it's against AESIV's policy to travel unattended with corporate intellectual property, so... So, uh, what did they sort out? Harris is going to put Bateman on bus driver duty. Shit, man, I heard that dude. I don't want to be a nanny for these freaking guys, anyway, you know? Hell, no! That's for the new recruits. Besides, we're taking the Express route in. All right, cool. Now was it me or did I see you still carrying that assault? Shit, shut up, man, what, you still got your peashooter, or what? Of course. Anyway, man, so how was Thailand? Puerto Rico. Shit. Whatever, man. You probably still chasing the ladyboys down there too, huh? Oh, yeah, and they're asking about you, too. Shut up, I bet they were. [Anya] You three will be going up to the site tomorrow. This is Harris. He's in charge of your detail, and commanding officer of your mission. Febles, Torres. Nice to meet you all. Miss Anderson, with all due respect, I think this is a little overkill. My job is to protect the company's interests, its employees, its networks, its facilities and its finances. Do you understand that? [Anya] Have I made that absolutely clear to you? I protect all of the company's intellectual property, and I will use whatever resources I deem necessary. The detail will guide you to the site and assist you in gathering all the necessary information you find on your excursion. I am not prepared to go to the site. I don't have a change of clothes, I don't have tools or anything. We'll allow you to go home. You may pack your bag. The detail will organize provisions, accommodations. [Anya] And you'll meet here tomorrow morning at 7 o'clock. Just relax. Consider it a business trip. [sighs] Care to share? [Monica] Not really. Look, Dr. Grey can take care of himself, all right? Ms. Anderson said that we would rendezvous with him in the field tomorrow, so... That's what bothers me. What do you mean? I don't trust her, any of them. It doesn't make sense. Why now? I'm not following. If they wanted us in the field, why didn't they send us with Walter to begin with? Why are they sending us now? What's changed? Look, I'm sure they have their reasons. Their reasons are what concern me. I don't think they're telling us everything. Okay, what reasons would they have to lie? I don't know, Alan. What could a for-profit company stand to gain from research regarding the whereabouts of the Fountain of Youth? Point taken. I mean, are you not concerned at all that they just show up here in the middle of the night unannounced with an entourage of bodyguards and demand that we assist Walter with the research? I find it suspicious that they arrived immediately after our conversation with Dr. Grey. Exactly. Do you think they're monitoring our conversations? I don't know. [chuckles] You know, Monica this... This sounds crazy, okay? We sound like crazy people. So, you're not worried? Yes, of course. I'm a little concerned. But, I mean, AESIV came in at the last minute and saved our research. And Dr. Grey said it himself, they want us to succeed. And yes, they stand to gain a lot of money from our research, especially, if what we've discovered turns out to be true. But don't you think that would make them want to help us even more? Yes, but at what cost? Look, we are on the verge of a very big discovery, okay? And tomorrow we will be out in the field with Dr. Grey making our dreams into a reality. You're not even a little bit excited? A little. I knew it. Alan, we agreed it would be simpler this way. I know. I'm gonna go. Alan. I hope you're right about AESIV. Me too. [suspenseful music] Pack it up. We're on foot from here. Heads-up. ♪♪♪ Beautiful! I'm sorry, what?

Like earthquakes and volcanoes, hurricanes and tornadoes. They're signs. [Monica] We see them every year, and every year they grow in strength and number, right? Classic liberal climate change bullshit. [laughs] Not bullshit. Fact. Our impact on this planet is unsustainable. The fact is, doctor, that Ms. Anderson invited you here to the great American nowhere to assist us on this mission. And the fact is, as long as you do what we say, you, us, we will be one big happy AESIV family. Then we'll see if it's worth the hassle bringing you out here. Worth the hassle? Are you serious?

[screams] ♪♪♪ [growl] Did you hear that? You two, stay here. Get that fucking light out of my face. Lower your weapon. Where's Evans? Wait, where's Riley? What happened to Walter? Where are they? Dead. And you'll be dead too if you don't shut up and listen. [screams] Go down. It's here. [Harris] It must've followed us. [gunshot] Alan! [Monica sobs] See what you've done? What did he do to anyone? I didn't do that. That monster did that. Killed Riley, killed my men. You do not put this shit on me. In fact, you... You call this Indian water demon, or I'll stack your body on top of his. Harris, she is not the enemy. I should've known. I put you in charge, and this is what I get? You're questioning my authority? You murdered him! Your rank means nothing now. All he wanted to do was leave this godforsaken place. He was scared. Just like you. You watch your fucking mouth! No, Harris. Stand down, or I will put you down. ♪♪♪ [screams] ♪♪♪ I am your commanding officer! You're in command? [grunts] Looks like the mission has defeated you, Harris. No! [coughs] [growl] [grunts] [growl] [grunts] [gunshots] You hit? No. Vest. [tense music] [pants] That's the way out. Let's do it. Let's go. ♪♪♪ Give me something, Febles. Give me something. Torres and that bitch-ass doctor are liabilities. Here! They went over the edge, here. Good. What's the plan now, sir? Well, they obviously betrayed us. Hunt them down. Kill them all. Copy that. ♪♪♪ [coughs] Shouldn't have left them there. Walter or Alan. No one gets left behind. We get out alive, that's the sacrifice that they have made for us. We get out, we come back for our fallen in a week, get our revenge. I am sorry about your friend. Bateman was one of the good guys. Look, we have to keep moving. Come on. [tense music] Where the hell have you been? [thunderclap] [growl] What does it want from us? [growl] [growl] [growl] Fear is not the path to freedom. [Anahu] Do not let it consume you. [growl] Look within for balance, and you will find peace. [thunderclap] [thunderclap] What just happened? She was a wise and strong one. She had an awakening. Well, well, well, Febles. Look at what we have here. You thought you could just compromise my mission and run away? No! AESIV protocol stands. This mission has been compromised. Unfortunately for you, it ends here. [Harris] And you. You, this is all your fault. Again you desecrate our home. You shed your blood on our land. This is AESIV's land now. [thunderclap] The water, ours. The profit, ours. [Harris] What's the matter, they don't have history class at the Wigwam? It does not end well for your people. This land was your land, but now this land is our land. Harris, you are a pathetic little racist coward. And you deserve to die. Shoot that bitch. Hell, yeah! [gunshot] [growl] [growl] [heavy footsteps approaching] [screams] Come on! [growl] [screams] [Enuattii moans] [moans] [screams] [Enuattii screams] [Harris screams] [Enuattii grunts] [Enuattii growls] Thank you, great Enuattii, proud water spirit and protector. The actions of men have once again brought upon your rage. You have judged and laid low all those who have meant to destroy others and our sacred land. It is time for you to rest now, my brother. [thunderclap] Thank you, Ahanu. Monica! [chanting in Ininkwe language] You healed me. How? The balance. Harris was the death and the darkness, but you are the life and the light. One soul leaves, another soul returns. It is and has always been as I have always been. [chanting in Ininkwe language] Are you okay? I thought Harris shot you. He did. [mysterious music] Good morning, gentlemen. Thank you for coming in at such short notice. As you can see, it's time to move things forward to phase three. [tense music] ♪♪♪ [growl] [man] This is our land now! [old man] Our land. [board member] Too much time has passed. Too much money wasted. [Monica] We need to find Dr. Grey, he could be out there hurt. [Evans] Hello to you, too, Torres. [Evans screaming] [Harris] You will do exactly as I say. [Dr. Grey] You fool! [Dr. Grey] The Enuattii... [Anahu] You think you can challenge the laws of nature? [Anahu] Nature's law has no mercy. [Enuattii growls] [Harris] Show yourself, you coward! [Febles] Whoa, whoa, whoa. Riley, calm down. [Riley] There's something in here with us. [Febles] Give me that before you hurt yourself. [Harris] This appears to have been an attack. [Torres] I thought Harris shot you.
