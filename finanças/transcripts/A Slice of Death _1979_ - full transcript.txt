"Shaolin Monastery" One Two Three Four Five Six Seven Eight Stop! Brother Zhi Shan, the Abbot would like to see you Greetings to Abbot Zhi Shan, you've been a monk since you were a kid How long have you been in this monastery? I came here since I was six, it's been twenty years For years, monks in this monastery have practised martial art to resist Qing but we are short of weapons The Qings forbid the possession of weapons by people that's why we have to make them ourselves I'm now ordering you to go to the Wen Shu Temple Go and meet Priest Wu Chen to get the blueprints of gunmaking and steelwelding Do you think you can manage this task? I'll do my best Good Wu Chen was an exMing general He's very good at kung fu You can stay and learn from him I will! Brother Zhi Shan We students from Shaolin aren't allowed to leave freely This time Abbot ordered you to the Er Mei Mount You're lucky to have the chance to move around to get some experience People in the martial arts world are crafty There are pitfalls everywhere, you must be very careful Brother Fei Wen is right but man is by nature kind Otherwise, Buddha wouldn't have come to save us Do you have Abbot's letter with you? Yes! Brother, please! Take care Goodbye Master, haven't seen you around here at Mt. Er Mei May I ask where you are from and where you're headed? I am from Shaolin Monastery at Song Shan and have to go to Wen Shu Temple to see Priest Wu Chen What a coincidence. Wu Chen happens to be my uncle Across this mountain is the Wen Shu Temple Thank you Madam! Please! I don't know you, and this path is precarious I must be on my guard against your sudden attacks I know abbot's requirements The weapons drawings he wants would take at least 3 months to compile You stay here first. I'll get it done as soon as I can Thank you! What else did the abbot want you to do? He said you excel at martial arts and wants me to learn from you That's laudable I'll take you as my student Teacher, my respects! Good! Dao de Yes Take Zhi Shan to the guest room Yes! Since the Shaolin Monastery is dedicated to expel the Manchurians its kung fu must be extraordinary! Everyone in the monastery is busy practising How many years have you practised? I joined at six and am twenty six now So you have practised for twenty years You must be peerless May I venture to match blows with you? Brother Feng, why did you use such a fatal maneuver? That's what I've learnt You'll recover after a month's rest I admit I've not mastered kung fu Some day I'll meet him again Brother, it's your own fault I saw you used a devastating technique to attack him He hurt you only out of selfdefense It wasn't intentional, please excuse me Zhi Shan, don't blame yourself This is my younger brother Bai Mei whojust returned from his tour He got some Shaolin news from the court which may interest you The Court has found out about Shaolin secretly indulging in martial arts and making weapons Those from Shaolin have been classified as rebels and yet you have retained a Shaolin monk here I don't think it's right What do you mean? Shaolin is committed to expel Manchurians That is a heroic act we should all contribute our part If you want to be friends with rebels I have nothing to say Brother, to each his own From this day we go separate ways There must be some truth in this news from brother Bai Mei I'll inform Shaolin Monastery For the meantime concentrate on your kung fu Yes! You have practised kung fu at Shaolin for years what are your specialties? DragonVanquishing Palm Iron head And SingleFinger Meditation You have been practising hard style kung fu but now you should work on your inner powers; This transcends all kung fu For Chopping, exhale from the abdomen Strength is exercised from the palm Once you master it you can break the jars For Iron Head, practise neck strength first Exhale and focus all strength towards the head Guang Yuan Yes! Dan Tian Gang Yes! Yue Ying Qi Yes! Monks in the Shaolin Monastery are conspiring to rebel What have you found out about it? We have sent someone inside, posing as workers it's confirmed they are practising kung fu in secret and have treacherous intentions Why haven't you wiped them out? There are underground secret chambers We must not arouse their suspicion I order you to wipe them out in 3 months failing which you'll be beheaded Troops of He Nan are at your disposal Yes I'm grateful for your instructions in this half year, sir You've assimilated everything well and have made remarkable progress Keep on practising after your return Yes! Keep well the weapons drawing Yes. Please go back, I'll take your leave Zhi Shan must pass here on his way to Shaolin today When he does so, I'll teach him a lesson Brother Zhi Shan is a gentleman it's your fault too that day Why are you doing this? I don't want the master to blame us Go away if you're afraid Uncle Bai Mei has said we are free to kill Zhi Shan What a coincidence we meet here Brother Feng, I am returning to Shaolin So you have learnt our Er Mei kung fu and want to return to Shaolin to show off Why do you say this? Teacher said learning kung fu is just for defense this is the only purpose I want to see if you could defend yourself Shaolin Monastery is full of secret tunnels and cells you've sketched it well Thank you, Mr Li We have two spies staying in Shaolin for half a year Until today we've found out the layout of the monastery I hear their rules are strict and monks are not allowed to leave Yes, I was instructed to buy foodstuff today that's why I could come here Mr Li Yes! Tell them to prepare dynamite and hide it all inside the food Let them bring back to the Monastery Yes! Pick out 400 elite for this duty after eradicating Shaolin, they'll be promoted Yes! Return to Shaolin first to help us there Go back, hurry! Yes Some men are here May I ask why are you here at this late hour? By the order of His Majesty Tibet's Lama is here, ask your abbot to welcome him Since Bodhidharma travelled south our Monastery honoured the Zen sect We have no connection with Tibet's esoteric doctrine Please go back You dare disobey an imperial order? Shaolin will be eliminated for disobedience Come on, men! Attack! Kill them! Attack! The Manchurian troops are here... Guard the monastery's gate, quick! Guard the monastery's gate, I'll protect the Abbot Hurry Abbot, the Manchurian troops are attacking us Order everyone to resist Come with me to fight, hurry! Those monks are all in the secret cells Let's go! It's in the front The secret cell is underneath the well Great, those monks are hiding in the cell We will use dynamite to block the tunnel They are all trapped None of them can get away Throw it down! Hurry! Let's rush out and kill the Tartars You protect the Abbot Yes! Spare my life! Blow them up! Abbot... run! Where's the Abbot? Abbot! He's in the secret cell Abbot! Abbot! Zhi Shan! What happened to you? You are back Run! Hurry and run! Use the dynamite to blow up the Monastery Yes! Let's go! Abbot! I can't make it, you better run for your life! No, Abbot. How can I leave you behind Did you get what I ordered you to get? Yes But what's the use? Yes, the Shaolin Monastery is destroyed It's your duty to rebuild it Do you understand? Yes, I'll risk my life to have the Shaolin Monastery rebuilt Go to the south The people there have an unbending spirit Go and solicit offerings and look for heroic men to rebuild the Shaolin Monastery Yes! Guang Dong and Fujin have famous mountains South Shaolin must be rebuilt Yes, Abbot, I will take up this responsibility I'm relieved South Shaolin must be rebuilt Even though I've to beg every penny of it Shaolin Monastery must be rebuilt in the South "Guang Dong" Sir, please offer me a vegetarian diet and allow me to stay for a night Nonsense. I'm running a business, not doing charity Without money, even gods are unwelcome Go away... Master, please stay His lodging and boarding will be on me Yes Sir! Master, have a seat! Thank you, Sir! Li Ba Shan, are you sure the information is correct? Shaolin has been destroyed and Zhi Shan fled? Teacher, this is absolutely true A relative of mine just came back from Guang Dong He saw a monk who begged alms claimed that he would rebuild Shaolin in the South Good aspiration I'd say, but it's not that easy to rebuild the Shaolin Monastery all by himself Dao de Why are you so dejected? I just returned from the Wen Shu Temple A general with an imperial appointment for my teacher, honoring him as a Taoist Chief Teacher insisted on turning it down Wu Chen has no respect for His Majesty When I tried to persuade him, he thundered with rage and said that if I ever brought this up again he'll evict me With your fame and kung fu you are no worse than teacher You can earn the title unreservedly Of course but so far there's no imperial order An imperial decree is here You are Taoist Bai Mei? It's my honor to meet you today This is an imperial envoy General Yue Ying Qi General Yue By imperial order you are appointed as Taoist Chief Please accept the imperial mandate On your knees I accept the imperial order The imperial mandate reads: Honouring Priest Bai Mei of Er Mei today, I decree that he be named as Head of Taoism and spiritual leader Dao de, what's the time now? It's already the fifth watch, please take your medicine Is there any news from Zhi Shan? I hear he's gone south to rebuild the Shaolin Monastery Since he has the will, he will succeed Go and rest Yes! The medicine... You... Teacher... Why have you done this? I'm under imperial order to suppress the rebels Teacher! Wu Mei, go down south and find Zhi Shan Rush to Guang Dong to capture Zhi Shan alive Hold it there! If you want money, just take it but don't hurt anyone Let's go! Silence him Go away! Let's go... Thanks for your help Fate has brought us together again My home is just three miles from here Please go there to have a rest Thank you! Please... Sir, your kung fu is great The best in Guang Dong Of course Uncle! Jin Lun, since you like martial arts I've invited a Shaolin martial artist here Go and meet him in the sitting room Uncle, in the martial arts world many claim to be Shaolin kung fu experts but they are mere imposters Don't be taken in How can you say such things? When I was robbed on the road he rescued me You are naive How do you know he wasn't their accomplice? Ah Fu! Yes! Bring the monk here and I'll teach him a lesson to see if he dares to cheat any more Hurry and go! Yes! Jin Lun, you... Sir, Master is here Please! Master! Master... please Let me introduce, this is my nephew Jin Lun Monk, did you knock down several robbers on the road? Yes! So you also know kung fu Only a smattering of it Monk, how should one start when learning kung fu? One should start with breath control; However, a young and impulsive youth like you should start with taking stances That is the basis of all kung fu Master, have a seat! Thank you, sir. But my sole purpose here is to raise funds for rebuilding Shaolin If you can sit firmly, we'll offer half of our 20 silk shops in Guang Zhou Deal Deal Hurry Young Master... Teacher, if you agree to take me as your student I'd rather give you all the 20 silk shops Half is enough Have you done what I've instructed you? Don't worry! Don't lie to me They say, Master Zhi Shan is an expert in kung fu Master Zhi Shan's kung fu is fascinating My nephew Jin Lun used to be haughty But now He has been totally overwhelmed by Master You are too naive to have given away ten silk shops like that In case he's a worldly monk you'll have made a fool of yourself! He's from Shaolin Monastery It's impossible I've got ways to find out by testing him If you find out he's honorable you ought to contribute more to rebuild the Shaolin Monastery No problem... everyone We are all willing to contribute but you can't let him know now Of course Good, deal Bring the monk to my home tomorrow I've an idea Come... let me introduce This is my good friend He's Ling Ho, a rich merchant from Guang Zhou Meet Master Zhi Shan of Shaolin An honour indeed to have you here My mother maintains quite close ties with Buddha When she heard that Master is in Guang Zhou she insisted on your staying here for a few days and performing praying for her, if it's okay with you Since you are devout, I must accept Great. Ah Gui prepare some vegetarian food for Master Yes! Master, please come with me to the shrine Yes! Please! This way! Hurry... put it down, hurry Lift it up! Miss Jinbao, Master is waiting for you Follow me! She's here! Masters, sorry to keep you waiting Jinbao, remember what I've told you Don't worry, unless he isn't a man I'll make him yield to my temptation even if he's a Buddha We'll count on you. Make good preparations Just count on me Master, please! You must tired, please take a rest Thank you! Help! Help! Master, help! Who is it? Help! Miss, what happened? My stomach ache recurs, it can only be cured by a man's belly pressed against mine Master, please help me! How can there be such a disease? It's not appropriate for you to stay here It really hurts! You are a monk, you should be merciful How can you not help me? It hurts! If you don't go away, I'll leave Wait! Thanks for your help A small token of my appreciation Madam I saw this monk last night he was really unmoved by beauty but his greed got the better of him Jinbao left a bag ofjewels last night and he kept it This shows he is not too respectable Don't blame him. A monk is also human Coveting small gains is inevitable Right! Were it you or me, we mightn't even have been able to resist Jinbao too, not to mention the lure of money Correct Sir, Master is here Please! Good morning! I picked this bag up in the backyard last night it contains valuable jewellery It must be yours, so I have come to return it I admire you for not being greedy but a monk shouldn't lie You said you picked this up from the backyard I fear that's not the whole truth You've reprimanded me well, but as the origin of the jewelry is questionable, I'd rather not reveal the truth or it may ruin someone's reputation I'll take my leave Master, wait Your noble character is commendable I'll contribute my share for the rebuilding of the Shaolin Monastery What about you, gentlemen? I've two mountains in Fujin best suited for building the Shaolin Monastery You can take one I'll donate half of my profit in my business for your disposal I have 300 acres farmland I'll donate them to Master Thank you all! Get lost! Come out Priest, what do you mean by this? I just want some donation No problem. Give him twenty coppers Bull shit Keep it for a beggar! Then how much do you want? I heard you promised a Shaolin monk that all your money would be given for his disposal Is it true? I don't want much Just fill up this tripod with silver and I'll leave Get lost! Go in and get the silver Listen, I'll sleep before the door and whoever approaches, gets it Priest Scram! Excuse me, it's him May I know your Buddhist name please? I'm here to solicit offerings. Go away This is not solicitation, it's blackmail So what? How is Wu Chen related to you? I don't know him How are you related to Bai Mei? None of your business Thank you Master! Please come to Jing Chan Temple for a chat Sister Brother Zhi Shan So you too have come to Guang Zhou I saw what happened just now That crook is called Lee Ba Shan a student of Bai Mei Bai Mei defected to the Qing regime and killed teacher Now they are after you Master Wu Chen is killed! I'll stay here for the time being come to me if need be How are you getting on with fund raising? Guang Dong people are charitable I have got enough money I got a mountain site too But I'd like to get more supporters before going to Fujin to build the Monastery Make way, let me handle it Try harder...

And pay me back thirty Did you see our rule here? For goods once sold, there'll be no refund You've taken the meat, give me the change Damn you, pay me! Are you paying or not? Great, you've torn my clothes My clothes are worth eighty coppers So you have to pay me 110 Trying to evade payment? How is it? Not bad My pig's feet are not bad either Are you trying to ruin my chances? Are you blind? This is the toilet not a place for fighting Smells good? It stinks! You bastard, don't run! You two are good at kung fu Don't hurt each other for anger at the spur of the moment You know nothing, monk Go away! Punches and kicks have no eyes we don't want to hurt you Damn monk, beat him up! Butcher, we should fight him Why are you hitting me? The damn monk was behind us Can't move any more? Not bad Don't move! You are so obedient I can take you as my students Damn monk, I'll teach you a lesson Beat him up Teacher! Teacher! I'm looking for you everywhere Who did you fight with?

Yes, he's been practising the post for three years He has mastered the light skill One with his perseverance must be good I may recruit him in rebuilding the Shaolin Monastery But he's one of those who think highly of themselves and it's not easy to convince him Alright, I'd like to test him when he's back Seeing is believing You are Master Zhi Shan? Yes, I am He's my good friend I've long heard of your excellent kung fu I'd like to spar with you I'm only a rowdy.

Wait! Your posts are fixed I'm not used to it Let me hold up a few special ones What do you think? As you please Casserole posts Come up! Great!

A boat is coming, Teacher! Sail it over Come on...
