Subtitles by explosiveskull [rain pattering] [intense music] [thunder rumbling] [music continues] [indistinct chatter on radio] [siren wails] Miss? Excuse me. Wait. You alright? Can you hear me, miss? Uh... - Um... - You know where you are? - A-are you hurt in any way? - Uh... Was-was someone chasing you? Do you... No, I'm sorry. I'm... I'm alright. My name is Sarah Foster. I'm a student of the college. I can give you my address. Would you like us to give you a ride back? Okay. [instrumental music] [indistinct chatter on radio] Oh, my God. Are you okay? They called. I said that you were still in bed. No, I didn't lock the door again. I know. It's crazy. You're okay, though? Yeah, I'm fine. - Oh, you scared me. - I'm sorry. I didn't think it would happen again. [instrumental music] Hello? [music continues] You making coffee? I took the bus. Feet are still all wet. Oh, you said you were gonna change this. This doesn't even look like me. I was thinking, instead of going out for lunch we could get something delivered. Just stay in, stay warm. [music continues] Jonathan? [Jonathan] Just stop. What's the matter? I don't want you to see. See what? [cocks gun] - Jonathan, what are you doing? - I'm sorry. - Jonathan... - I can't help it. Jonathan, please, please. - Please, Jonathan! Jonathan! - I can't help it. [gunshot] [instrumental music] [female #1] Dr. Cooper, your next patient is here. Sarah Foster? I thought I recognized the name. You were in a class of mine when you were an undergraduate. - Do you remember? - Of course I do. I remember. I read the form you filled out and the university still had your file. And of course, I've seen what happened in the papers. - I'm very sorry for you. - Thank you. But the form gave a different reason for you coming in. Yes, I'll always be coping with his suicide. But I saw a doctor for a year, and I decided to come back to school and finish my dissertation. To try to get back to where I was before. But since I've been back, I've been walking in my sleep. At first, it was just around my apartment but a few days ago, the police found me and I had walked almost three miles. Wasn't your door locked? I unlocked it in my sleep. Did you ever sleepwalk before coming back to school? How is your sleep apart from that? Not good. I have trouble falling asleep. And I have nightmares. Can you tell me about them? Usually, there's a man. I can't see him, but I know he wants to hurt me and I can't get away. Sometimes I can't move or even get any air when I breathe. Do the same dreams repeat? Well, it's always the same man. I don't know who he is or who he would be. - How are your moods? - Sad. Lonely. But I'm working at it. At moving forward. Grief can be overwhelming. And it certainly is a factor in what you're going through right now. But your sleep disorder could be purely a medical issue. I'd like to schedule a check-up for you and also introduce you to some people that I think can help you here at the university. - Is that alright? - Of course. You're going to keep getting better, Sarah. I believe that, and there are certainly going to be some tough patches, but you're facing your new life very bravely. I want you to come and see me at any time, for any reason at all. Okay? Thank you. And maybe find a way to put a second lock on that door. Okay. [instrumental music] I'm going to the sleep research center tonight. To sleep? - That'll be weird. - Mm-hmm. Oh, hey, do you remember Neal Owens? I finally sent him a text message. I was gonna have you read it before, but then I just didn't. Hmm. I figured if you want something, you got to put the idea out there, so I did. I thought he was your professor. Technically, he's my professor but I mean, I just figured if everything works out I could just drop the class, right? I thought about sending him a picture. Oh, don't do that. Leave something for his imagination. You haven't gone out with anybody since I've met you. No one's asked. You know, I read somewhere that every day you should identify three potential soulmates and then you visualize all these details about them and then you bring them to life in your mind. Okay, see him? If he asked me out... A funeral? It's a little dark, but which one? [Sarah] That one, getting out of the car. [Dawn] He looks a little married. Oh, I'm imagining him single. That's good. That's right. First step is to think about it. [instrumental music] [Koslov] So your blood work came back fine but that doesn't rule out everything. The dream where you reported a sense of suffocation that can be a sign of sleep apnea. It's a disorder where you stop breathing while you're asleep. Isn't that dangerous? We'll know by tomorrow morning if you have it and then we can treat it. What we'd like to do is have you stay here for a few nights so we can build a profile of your sleep life. This machine here monitors all your vitals, your respiration your heart rate, EEG, readout of everything that's going on inside your head. My dreams? Not exactly, just your neural activity. Uh... but we will know when you're dreaming and exactly what's going on inside your head before you dream. And what if I walk in my sleep? Uh, there's a break-away cable right there. We'll also have someone watching you throughout the night. That way, you don't go anywhere. - So I can't leave. - Of course you can. [Scott] But only when you're awake. [Koslov] Sarah, uh, this is Dr. White. He's the, uh, director of this center. Sarah Foster. Hi. Could you come see me when you're finished here? Hm. I'll leave you to it. I'll be right back. Thank you. [crickets chirping] Oh, excuse me. Excuse me. Did you need Dr. Koslov? I tried, and I don't think it's working. Well, it's faulty. What did you need? I just don't think I'm gonna be able to fall asleep in here. Well, that's normal. I did not sleep last night anyways. I know that I know you. I don't think so. Oh, at the funeral. I saw you at the funeral. - Were you there? - Yeah. Well, I-I was nearby, walking to the cemetery. Who was it? It was a young woman. She was a student here at the school. Sorry. I saw you in the car with your wife. Oh, that's another doctor here. I'm not married. Oh, me neither. I mean, I was but... To the writer? Yeah. Oh, that must have been interesting. You know, loving him didn't mean loving his writing. I shouldn't say that. I mean, I knew his books were good. Great even, it's what I studied, but... ...sometimes I would read his stuff and just not connect with it. Not like I did with him. He'll never know I said that. I'll have Dr. Koslov bring up one of these. Okay. - Sleep well. - Thank you. [door opens] [eerie music] [music continues] [Koslov] Good morning, Sarah. Hopefully, you weren't too alarmed we moved you last night. There's better monitoring equipment here. - It's nicer. - Okay. How do you feel? I slept the whole night. I haven't done that in months. Did I do anything strange? Uh, no, you slept quietly. I don't think I had any dreams. Uh, that's pretty normal for the first night. Can't believe you moved me and I didn't wake up. Uh, good news, Dr. White here is gonna stay personally involved in your case, uh, which is a-a big deal. Good. Okay. Great. Sarah, what we learned last night is that you have fairly unusual neural patterns. It's not anything to be concerned about from a health perspective. Your thetas are very unique. What we see here normally is the same thing over and over. But your brain waves... Could that be causing my sleep walking? [Scott] It's possible but not likely. We'll find out. Right now, we're just building a basic profile. [Koslov] What we'd like to do is have you stay here at least three nights this week, if possible. Oh, I'll stay here every night if I sleep this well. Good. [plane droning] Hey. How was it? It was good. I slept. God, how nice that is! I go back tomorrow. Hey, do you remember that man we saw at the funeral? The one in the car. I met him. He's the director at the center. Look at you, home-wrecker. It wasn't his wife driving. It was another doctor. Oh, that's boring. He's nice. - Is that your professor? - No. Haven't heard from him. I'm starting to think I'm done with that whole thing. I should have sent him those pictures. See ya. [male #1] The prince's brain was-was addicted to the dopamine release that came from thinking about her. Love's inevitable drop in serotonin level meant he was gonna grow more and more obsessed. 'Cause let's face it, ladies and gentlemen chemically, love is just a type of a bipolar disorder. It can lead to heroism or homicide and even happily ever after but for our prince the script was over before their first kiss. You don't buy it, do you? - That there's no free will? - Mm-hmm. I see the science, but... there's more to love than chasing a dopamine high. [female #2] What he did was beautiful. Okay, but-but look at his mental states in the story. Sleeplessness, elation, loss of appetite devotion, obsession, disconnection, grief, rage. Am I the only one who thinks the origin for some of the most exhilarating, romantic love stories might be... chemical imbalance. Okay, by a show of hands. Who sides with Miss Wells? What? Are we on the same side? Foster. [male #1] Beg your pardon? You said Wells, it's Foster. I'm afraid I don't follow. My name is Sarah Foster, not Wells. Sarah Foster. If that's how you'd like it to be, sure. Is he making some kind of a joke? Your name is Sarah Wells. Hey, what's my last name? What? Wells. The last time I checked. Did you think I didn't know your last name? [intense music] [music continues] Dr. Cooper left at 5:00. I sent a message to her phone but she'll definitely be back in the morning. This is kind of important. Did you give her my number? I did. Is there anything else I can do for you, Miss Wells? [Koslov] Sarah. Uh, he's not gonna be in until later. He and I are both your doctors. If you wanna tell me what's happening... I'd rather wait for Dr. White. Let me ask you something. One of our staff, uh, found this in the hallway outside the room we moved you to last night. When a patient has a dream that we deem to be significant we fill out one of these forms. This one has your name on it. I didn't have any dreams. That's what I thought too, but... ...you described being chased by a woman. Someone who hurt you. That's not my dream. You sure? Yeah, and it's not my handwriting. Yeah, look. Wait. [crickets chirping] [machine beeps] [intense music] Good morning. We came to see you last night but you were already sleeping. Dr. Koslov said you wanted to ask me something. Nothing. I-I feel better. I was just anxious. About? Nothing. There's nothing. Okay. No dreams last night? Not that I remember. That's what the machine told us too. And you're coming to see us again the day after tomorrow. Hmm. [instrumental music] Excuse me. Do you work here? I do. Can I ask, are there any types of amnesia where a person might forget only one single thing. Are you, uh, working on a... working on a class study? If a patient forgot their name but nothing else. What if everything else was normal? - Partial retrograde amnesia. - Right. Is that curable? It can be permanent but... ...in a vast majority of cases it-it goes away on its own. It can be induced by a traumatic event uh, brain injury or even disrupted sleep. It usually just takes care of itself, though? Almost always. Now the clinical protocol is to get the patient back into the routine of their old lives. Really, that's it? That's everything that's happening. If the memory lapses ever become full-blown hallucinations then you're into psychosis territory. I'd... be happy to explain over a-a cup of coffee. No thanks. [metal clanking] [Nichole] Hey, how'd it go? Went well. Hi. Is Dawn in her room? - Who? - Dawn. Are you a friend of hers? Who's Dawn? - Did it happen again? - Did what happen again? The sleep-walking thing. You know about my sleep-walking? Yeah. You live here? Yup. Since the beginning of the school year? Are you... mad at me or something? 'Cause I have lab in, like, ten minutes and I... No, not at all. It's just that... Can you tell me your name? Why are you being so weird? Sorry, it's just... What is it? Nichole Wyatt. Do I need to worry about you? No. No, I just... I had a weird night and... Yeah. [cellphone vibrating] Hello? [male #2 over phone] Sarah. - Who's this? - Sarah. - You know who I am. - What? You're all I can think about, Sarah. Who is this? I'm the one out here in the dark. [intense music] [cellphone vibrating] No one has ever touched you like I do. Do you like it when I watch you? When I'm close. [music continues] Excuse me. I'm sorry. I'm Elaine Cooper. I can see you in just a moment. - Dr. Cooper. - Yes? It's Sarah. I'm sorry, I just got here, but I'll be able to see you in just a moment. We spoke to each other few days ago. - On the phone? - No, I'm Sarah. Sarah... I couldn't find a file for her. I came in to see you. You remembered me from when I was a student here. - We talked about my husband. - Three days ago? S-Sarah Foster. - Sarah Wells. - I checked both names. My husband was Jonathan Grey. The author. Is that so? - You don't remember? - No. Um, sorry, it happens. I'm not as young as I used to be. Were you at the hospital at all? - What? - At the Weiss clinic. No. I don't know what that is. Okay. Um, I wanna talk to you. But first we're gonna have to locate your records. Are there any other names you could be listed under? I-I'm gonna come back. Okay? - I'd rather you stay. - I'm gonna come back. Don't worry, I think I made a mistake. Are you sure? Can I call someone to come and pick you up? [crickets chirping] [instrumental music] [Nichole] Did you forget something? No. I'm not sleeping at the center tonight. - Everything okay? - It's fine. I'll go back tomorrow. [door locks] [sighs] [intense music] My name is Sarah Foster. [music continues] [gasps] [screaming] [panting] [intense music] [music continues] [indistinct chattering] [music continues] [plane droning] Thank you. [indistinct chattering] [music continues] [panting] [music continues] [cellphone vibrating] [male #2 over phone] Don't worry, Sarah. I'm always watching you. I feel like you're waiting for me. Do you know I came to see you last night? Feeling you, Sarah. Your bones under your skin. Could you feel my fingers moving over you? [intense music] [mumbling] [music continues] [music continues] - Hey. - Hey. Did you go back to the place last night? Yeah. I did. Um... Hey, can you let me in? I forgot my keys. Yeah. Where-where-where are you going? To meet Neal for coffee. Is that your professor? Duh. I sent him a bunch of pictures. - See ya. - Bye. [instrumental music] [music continues] Dr. White? Scott? Scott! Sarah? Sorry, your address was in the directory. I didn't know where else to go. I probably shouldn't have come, I'm... [Scott] No, no, it's fine. Come on. What's going on? I forgot my last name... ...or I remembered it wrong. It didn't use to be Wells. - It was Foster. - Foster? You knew me as Sarah Foster. But if I asked you right now, you'd say that you've never heard that name, right? And then I guess I remembered my roommate wrong. I had been living with this girl Dawn. And then it was this girl Nichole but... they're different people. And... who's there now? Dawn. She's back. I went to see Dr. Cooper, and she didn't remember me even though I had just seen her a couple of days ago. She had no idea. I was hoping you had some sort of explanation. Maybe, you've seen this before? Hi, Elaine, it's Scott White. Hey. Listen, I'm talking with Sarah Wells right now and we think it might be a good idea for her to come and talk to you on Monday. Uh-huh. But right now, I just wanted to have her say hello to you. Is that okay? Say hello. Dr. Cooper? Yeah, I'm feeling okay. Okay. [chuckles] Okay. Yeah, I'll have her call your office to set up a time. Great. Sure, sure. - She remembers you. - She didn't yesterday. I stood right there in her office. I'm not a psychiatrist. Sarah... you have unusual sleep patterns. Is that why this is happening? I don't know. It's possible something in your condition could be altering your perception of what's happening in your life. Well, what if it's not my perception? The world doesn't change in that way. Well, what if it does? I made a mistake coming back to school. I'm sorry, I... I'm gonna go. - Sarah. - Sorry, I bothered you. [instrumental music] [intense music] Sarah. Sarah! Sarah! Sarah! Sarah. Are you alright? He was waiting in my apartment. He saw me, he chased me. I don't know. He's been leaving me messages, and he wants to hurt me. - We have to go to the police. - No, I don't want to. You say he came after you. You have to go to the police. - I wanna go home. - Sarah, come on. Calm down. I don't wanna be here anymore. Get in. [panting] Okay. In here. It's probably someone you met for a moment. A few minutes. That's just it, it doesn't feel like... ...he's a stranger. Feels like the man in my dreams. I think it'll come to you. Ow! I got something for that. [indistinct mumbling] Let me see. I'm afraid to go back to sleep. - What if things change again? - Nothing's gonna change. If you have another one of these dreams... They're not dreams. I'm still having bad dreams. I had one last night. But when I woke up in that bedroom and it wasn't my room, I was awake. - Sorry. - It's okay. Thank you. I can't tell you that I understand what's happening to you but I do know about dreams. We think of them as stories, but really they're emotions. There's a... chemical trigger. When we sleep, the brain releases chemicals and we experience a rush of emotion. And then the thinking part of our brain tells us a story to explain those feelings. That house wasn't a dream. W-what if we treat it like it was? Tell me what you were feeling. I was afraid someone would find me. Who? The woman who lived there. I saw her dress on a chair. And? And I wanted to get out. But... I also wanted her to know that I was there. I was angry at her. I wanted her to be scared of me. But I don't, I don't know who she is. I don't... want anything to do with her. I'm gonna have you sleep here tonight. Things might look different in the morning. I'll just be right across the hall. There's a storm. I see 'em coming down from the mountains. It's beautiful. [thunder rumbling] If my mind is broken, can anything make me better? Why are you helping me? I don't know why... but I am. I will help you. I know that. We're going to get through to the other side of this. This is all gonna make sense. [thunder rumbling] Goodnight. Goodnight. [instrumental music] [whimpering] [panting] [eerie music] Go away. Go away. Go away. Go away! Get out of here! [gasps] Scott? [intense music] [crickets chirping] [music continues] Scott? Scott? [music continues] [music continues] Oh, hi. Is Dr. White here? Uh, yeah. Can I say who's here to see him? Sarah Foster. I'm sorry. Sarah Wells. One sec. Dr. White. Uh, Sarah... Wells outside. [Scott] Yeah. - Thanks a lot. - Yeah. - Did-did she leave? - No. She's right there. I'm here to see Dr. White. That's me. How can I help you? - I'm sorry. Scott White? - I'm Scott White. W-what's your name? Sarah Wells. Sarah Wells. That's funny, I guess. Actually, it's not funny, alright? I don't understand. I know Sarah Wells, you're not her. - Is she a patient here? - I couldn't tell you that. Then who am I? You tell me. Are you married? I'm-I'm sorry, what? I think I made a mistake. Wait, wait, wait. Do you-do you know Sarah Wells? Can you tell me who you are? Are you restoring an old house? Who told you that? Wait, m-miss, who told you about... Miss? Miss. Miss. Miss, you don't have to go. [dramatic music] [male #1] Sarah? [female #3] Go away. Go away. Go away! Go away! Go away! Go away! Go away! [music continues] [knocks on door] Come in. Good morning. How do you explain this? - How did I get here? - You don't know? I remember some things that you're gonna say aren't real. The last time I saw you, I went to sleep at your house. You don't remember coming back? You're sleepwalking again. The police dropped you off at my house some time after 11:00. You told them where I live. I don't remember. I brought you back here so we could get you on the machine. - I-I've been here all night? - Yeah. We both were. - Are you married? - No. - Have you ever been married? - No. In my dream, my imagination, whatever it is... ...you're married. Another you. Saw this early on, I didn't know what to make of it. It seems as though you are dreaming at night. In fact, this line indicates that you were dreaming straight through the entire night. Am I dreaming right now? You left deep sleep and woke up a few minutes ago. What is it that you remember? I woke up in that house again. And I came here and I met you in the lobby. But it was another you. A man called Scott White, but he worked here. He was treating a patient. S-she had my name. I think I saw her, but she's not me. I see. But that's not t-true, right? I mean, you're Scott White? [chuckles] Yes. I am Scott White. In this other world, who recognizes you? No one. So the changes all have to do with identity. There's the man who is leaving me the voicemails. The one who chased me. In a dream, we call that an anchor element. It connects the waking world to the world of the dream. I'm not dreaming. Tell me something... And I'm sorry to have to ask. Your husband's suicide. Why did he do it? Uh, he, uh... He, uh... I... I can't remember. Um, I can't remember him. Maybe there was no reason. No, no, I, uh went to a psychiatrist for over a year. I wrote in my journals about it. He left a note. I can't remember right now. I'm sorry. [instrumental music] Hey... don't you have class? I'm not going today. [music continues] Sarah! Hey. - Thank you for coming. - Are you okay? I want you to see this on the same screen that I've been looking at. - Is this it? - Mm-hmm. "Jonathan Alec Grey, award-winning novelist "was... murdered... ...November 11th." It says the man who stalked him wasn't... He wasn't murdered. It says that they found some of the man's blood in Jonathan's office, but they never caught him. He got away. But, Scott, Jonathan wasn't killed, was he? - But you knew how he died. - I learned it from you. Dr. Cooper knew. She told me. I don't remember any of that. This could be the man you saw. I know. I don't know. What's happening? I was working so hard at this. I was getting better. Let's talk to her and confirm. She won't remember me. This could be your memory coming back. - It didn't happen. - Look... Memories have a, a way of working their way back to the surface of consciousness. It doesn't always make sense. He wasn't murdered. I remember. [instrumental music] Hello. [music continues] [grunting] [gasping] You know me. [intense music] [panting] [thudding] [grunting] Help me! Help, please. He's trying to kill me. Sarah. - Hey. - He was here. [indistinct muttering] - He-he was inside... - It's okay. - He grabbed me, he tried to... - It's okay. Nobody's here. Nobody's here. You're safe now. Okay? Okay. [Sarah sobbing] [instrumental music] You don't believe me. You-you-you don't believe me. He was right... Uh... He was... Why don't they catch... I don't under... I know. [Scott] Dr. Koslov... showed me this. He said you filled it out. I didn't. Have you had any dreams like this? No. I didn't fill it out. Sarah, I need you to be calm. We need to look at what's happening. These perceptual issues are... - I don't wanna stay here. - She can stay with me. Sarah needs professional help. This isn't something we have a choice about. She has to be taken somewhere safe. Until these episodes are resolved you need professional help. Scott and I are both bound by the law on this. [Scott] This doesn't make sense to me. How can it make sense to you? - You think that I'm lying? - No, you're not. But we need to understand and to help you. We need to check you in to the clinic just for a couple of nights. For observation. W-well, just for rel... No. [Scott] I'll come with you. I wanna help. I can't be alone. Not in a place like that. What if it doesn't help? I-i-it didn't happen. He wasn't there. I imagined it. I won't tell anyone. I'll go with you to the clinic. You-you're not gonna be on your own. I'd like to admit a patient. Her name is Sarah Wells. [instrumental music] Yes, we have a room ready. I'm gonna be all alone. What-what if I wanna leave? Uh, for the first 24 hours, you'll be in our care. Well, what if I need to leave? You won't be able to. - Hey, guys. - It's okay. - Come on, take it easy, okay? - Let go of me! - Take it easy. - Let go of me! - She'll be alright. - Come on. - Please, get off me! - It'll be alright. God, please, please, please... [grunts] God! [instrumental music] [music continues] You see, I have to go home. But I'll be back first thing in the morning. Promise. I'm sorry... that we have to do this. And this is the right thing. [music continues] Elaine, I'm comin' over. [music continues] [grunts] Hey, thanks for meeting me. Sorry to make you leave your house again so late. It's fine. This really upset you, I can see that. But from what you had told me, you're doing the right thing. I won't lose another patient. I can't. I have to help her. You are helping her. Did you bring her file? I thought it was here. I don't see why it would be. What's the patient's name again? - What? - The girl. The one you told me about. Sarah Wells. You don't know her? No, but... Have I met her? Why did you change your clothes? What? Did we see each other? Earlier today? No... [intense music] [indistinct chattering] I'm taking her out. - Who? - Sarah Wells. Where is she? Oh, you can't. You've not got the proper authorization. What room is she in now? Alright. Alright. [indistinct screaming] She can't be conscious. She shouldn't be able to open her eyes. What have you got her on? [moaning] A lot. [music continues] I've got you. [indistinct muttering] I'm taking you home. [music continues] You're gonna be okay. You just need to go to sleep. Mm-hmm, I can't go back to sleep. Yes, you can. Sarah, listen to me, you can. No, no. I put that out of the... Sarah, listen to me. I went to see Elaine Cooper... ...after I left you at the clinic. When I went to see her, she didn't know who you were. What do you mean? - What does that mean? - I don't know. I don't know. This is what I was trying to tell you... ...but I will, I will. I promise. We're gonna make sense of all of this, yeah? Yeah, okay, keep talking to me so I don't go back to sleep. I can't go back to sleep. Don't make me go... - You have to go to sleep. - No. Yes, you do. Then I don't wanna go back to... [sighing] [whispers] There you go. There you go. I need to stay awake. I'm not goin' anywhere. [grunts] Let's go to sleep. Okay. [instrumental music] [music continues] [music continues] All morning I've been remembering things. The man who tried to hurt me his name was Warren Lambert. He was obsessed with my husband's books. He's crazy. They sent him to an institution for it. I know that he wasn't really there. No... That could be the way your mind is remembering him. I know. Tell me what happened to your husband. It was cold. Raining. My husband had gone to a reading to sign books. You have to understand how much people love my husband's work. Women especially. Still, I always knew we were safe. We were us. I thought I'd surprise him in his office. [instrumental music] And then, right in front of me my mind did somersaults trying to explain it. [woman laughs] There must be a mistake. But no... ...she was there. He admits it. He's sorry, he hates himself. What is that? What am I supposed to do with that? [indistinct laughter] He told me it would never happen again. Told her on the phone while I listened. But I knew I had to leave and I did. And after that, everything got dark. All those nights alone. He called, but I n-never answered. I left him. But... No... her. There was something wrong with her in her mind. Of course there was. She went to his office. He told her that it was over. The neighbors heard him. Telling her, yelling at her to go, but... ...she had a gun. She shot him. She... killed my husband. [instrumental music] [gunshot] [thunder rumbling] [thuds] [door opens] [intense music] [glass shatters] Ah! Stop it. Stop it. [grunting] [male #2] You're not goin' anywhere. [muffled screaming] [music continues] [grunting] [indistinct chattering on radio] [thunder rumbling] [male #3] Thanks for ringing. Thanks. Apparently, he was locked up for this once before. Miss Foster? Thank you. My name. Look. It's Foster. [instrumental music] [music continues] [music continues] [intense music] [crickets chirping] [horn blaring] [thunder rumbling] [music continues] [music continues] Who are you? Who are you? Go away. Go away. Go away. Go away. Get out of here. [music continues] [music continues] [door creaking] Go away. [whimpering] Leave me alone! Leave me alone. [sobbing] - Sarah? Sarah, it's alright. - No. Look! She's here. It's her. She's there. Right there. Don't you see her? - There's no one here. - I'm-I'm not asleep. It's-it's you and me, that's it. She's here. She's... Get away, get away. She's right there. Don't hurt me. Don't... Look at me. Look at me. Look at me. - Why can't you see her? - What the hell's going on? - She right there... - There is no one here. - Oh, my God. - There's no one there. Look, it's you and me. Th-there is no one here. - She's right there. - It's okay. Look at me. Look at me. Do you trust me? You need to lay down. Lay down, it's okay. Lay down, lay down, it's okay. I don't understand. What's happening? - She's dreaming of me. - What? Why? Think. There has to be a reason. Maybe she's already told us. [intense music] [keys jingling] It's always her. The same woman. She finds me. She comes inside my house. She watches me. She watches me while I'm sleeping. I can't feel safe in my own home. [sighs] I lock the doors but she must have the keys. At night... ...I see her waiting across the street. Just watching and waiting. Why can't I get her out of my head? [door closes] I knew you'd be here. - Jonathan? - Stop. I told you. You can't come here. I'm not going anywhere. It's raining. How about we stay in? [Jonathan] I'm calling the police. Stop. Wait. Please. Please. Stop. Please. She's here because she's having nightmares. And he's helping her. - You. - What? The actual you. And when he finds a cure, I... ...don't know what's going to happen. I'm her nightmare. That's not possible. There has to be explanation. [instrumental music] [Sarah] I loved Jonathan Grey. I-I wasn't his wife. [music continues] I was the other woman. My name is Anna. [gunshot] I remember now. The moment I put the gun to my head and everything went dark. The next thing I saw was this. I was in this place, walking towards you. Do you feel how warm it is? What? It's November, not summer. I guess I didn't want it to be cold. I-I wanted to be in this place. To be the love of his life. You said the clues in what I was seeing were about identity. - And you were right. - No. Listen. What we are experiencing, both of us... ...it's something else, it's a fugue state, it's a... It's love. Because he is you. I made you. Maybe so that I could see that I... So that I could find the truth. So that I could see what I had done. [instrumental music] But I-I know that I would find you again. I don't want this to end. Sarah. [music continues] [gasping] [dramatic music] [gasping] [machine beeping] [breathing heavily] [Anna gasping] [male #2] Don't worry, Anna. [intense music] [music continues] [Anna] My name is Sarah Foster.
