What's wrong with you? Where did you even get that? Johnny, what are you doing? 9-1-1, what is your emergency? Hello? 9-1-1. Do you have an emergency? Sir, can you speak? If you can't speak, press any button on your phone. Once for yes, twice for no. Are you still there? Sir, I want you to stay on the line for me, okay? I'm gonna track your location. Are you still with me? Hello? Are you still there? Okay. 129, Peterson Drive, Miles County Morgue. Sir, are you still with me? Just sit tight and remain calm. Police and paramedics are on their way... ♪ You're not alone ♪ ♪ You're not alone ♪ ♪ You're not alone ♪ Ma'am, I understand. But I can't give you that information. Your husband's the only one listed on the policy. Bitch! No, ma'am, not you. Not you. Mom, don't we have a tape measure? I don't know. Check the drawer by the microwave. Yes, ma'am! I understand that, but in the future, your husband's going to have to call the policy. All I can tell you is that it's still active. Yes. Mm hmm. Can you wait five minutes, and go get your brother, please? Yes, ma'am. My manager is just gonna tell you the same thing. So, did you figure out what you're dressing up as tomorrow? The Miles County clown. - Don't do that. - Why not? Because that's beyond disrespectful. What are we talking about? He wants to dress up as a real guy who murdered nine people last year. Do you have any idea how insensitive that is? Not to mention, sick. - Oh, you're not doing that. - It's just a costume. How would you feel if God forbid, he attacked someone in our family, and people celebrated him? That's basically what you're doing. You don't see people dressing up as Jeffrey Dahmer or Charles Manson. I think you're both overreacting. Do you? Charles Manson technically never killed anyone. All right, all right. Enough. I said, "No," and that's it. Did you know that Nazis used to inject children's eyeballs to see if they would change color? Jonathan! Thank you. So, what are your plans tomorrow? Megan Melanie's throwing a Halloween party. That's nice. Who are you going with, Allie? And Brooke. She's not driving, is she? I'm gonna take an Uber. Why, so you can get shitfaced? Who do you think I am, stupid, Sienna? Do we have to do this every time I go out? You know I don't drink. So you say. Your brother never closes these goddamn boxes. Give me that. I got it. Mom, do you ever... wonder about Jonathan? What do you mean? You know, he's... - He's an oddball. - So, what? He was looking up serial killers when I went in his room before. Now, he's... he's talking about Nazis and the Holocaust. - I mean... - It's just a phase, Sienna. It'll pass. You said that a year ago. Yeah, well, he lost his father. And I didn't? You don't see me crying out for attention. Yeah, well, I wish you would from time to time. You keep everything bottled up. It's not healthy. All right. Just don't be surprised if you find a dead animal in his room. You know what? Watch your mouth, huh? And what about you? When Daddy took you fishing for those midos or macos. Minnows. Whatever they're called. And he found you cutting the heads off. Didn't think I'd remember that, did you? I was a lot younger than Jonathan. Well, you were old enough to know the difference between right and wrong. Your brother's fine. Do you have any Super Glue? A little. - Why, what happened? - The string came off. I thought you weren't gonna wear this tomorrow. I won't paint my face then. - Jonathan. - Come on. It's too late to get another costume. Give me. Jesus. What, did you grow another foot since dinner? Tallest kid in my class. Yeah, well, I can still kick your ass. Not for long. That is sick. - How much do you have left? - Just finishing up the skull. It looks just like Daddy's character. You know? You draw almost as good as him now. Thanks. Is this a part of your costume, too? No. I could not walk out in the streets with that thing. I'd get arrested in like two seconds. Yeah. But nobody would mess with you. - That's for sure. - Right. Just be careful, please. That blade's like razor sharp. There. Should be good now. Awesome. You think that guy's still out there? Who? The Miles County clown. What's up with you and this clown all of a sudden? You're like obsessed. They never found his body. What if he decides to come back here? Is that why you wanna dress up like him? You think if he sees you wearing his costume, he'll be all cordial with you? Cordial? Friendly. No. I wouldn't worry about it. On the off chance that he is still alive, I'm sure he's gone far away from here. - Thanks again for the hat. - You're welcome. Tap lower down. Owen, I saw it again.

Speaking of surprises, kids, we have a very special guest with us today. Now, for a guy who doesn't speak, he sure makes a lot of noise. All the way from Miles County, please welcome Art the Clown. Whoo! Whoo! Yeah! Yeah! Stop everything you're doing now! I see you feeding your faces. Feed him! He's so hungry. Feed this man! Feed this man! Feed this man! Special prize included in every box. Shit. What's going on? - Mom! - Get downstairs! Jesus Christ! Mom, what are you doing? Come on! Really, Sienna? You left burning candles on your dresser all night? What are you, fucking stupid? I didn't do anything. They weren't lit. Then please explain to me how your goddamn room caught on fire. - I have no idea. - You have no idea. So, it just spontaneously combusted out of thin air? - I guess so. - Sienna... Get back to bed. You have school in the morning. - You mean I still have to go? - What did I say? You know what, Sienna? You are going to kill us one of these days, between your chemicals and your heat guns, and staying up until 4:00 in the fucking morning doing God only knows what! Oh, my God. For the hundredth time, I was not using chemicals and I did not leave burning candles on my dresser! - Why can't you just believe me? - Because... Stay in my room tonight, and I'll sleep on the couch. I don't mind sleeping on the couch. Go to bed. I kept whatever was in the bottom drawer. Most of it's ruined. Make sure you park in the garage when you get home. Those animals next door are always throwing eggs and shaving cream. I don't want the car getting scratched up. You know the sword Daddy got me? What about it? It was on top of my dresser last night. Well, maybe it can be restored. Is it bad? It's fine. There's not a mark on it. That's good. Can't say the same for your clothes. Jonathan, hurry up. You have five minutes. Welcome back to the program. If you're just tuning in, I'm sitting here live with the sole survivor of the Miles County massacre, which occurred exactly one year ago today. I've worked on the show for many years, and I've never sat across from someone who has a story to tell quite like yours. Thank you again for taking the time to sit down - and speak with me. - It's my pleasure. Now, when we left off, we were talking about the moment you woke up from the coma. Do you remember your initial reaction when you first saw your face? Yes. Would you like to share that with us? I wished I was dead. Do you still feel that way? People are frightened by the way that I look, especially children. And it's really difficult for me to deal with that, so isolation is ideal. Now, what about your attacker? The man only identified as Art the Clown. Well, there's a lot of controversy surrounding his supposed death. The authorities issued a statement, claiming that his body disappeared from the county coroner's office the morning after the attack. He's dead. I saw it happen. - What are you guys doing? - Dude, look what Sean found. It's the new mascot. Oh, man. Right up your alley, huh, J man? I wonder how it died. Probably had the school meatloaf. I think you should leave it alone. What for? He doesn't mind. It's so gross. Dude, you should have been here. Couple of birds were eating his asshole. Yeah. Watch this. Stephanie! Stephanie! Come here for a minute. Sean, come on. It's gonna be awesome. - What's up? - Check it out. Some cat just gave birth behind the dumpster. - Really? - Yeah. Go look at all the kittens. Oh, my God! What's wrong? Maggots need love, too! Stephanie! Can you? What's going on? Oh, shit. Ms. Principe. What are you boys doing back here? Oh, Christ. Mr. Henderson. - Nothing. - Really? You go find Mr. Curtis right now, and you have him move that. And you two, get to class. Move it! Jonathan. Keep your eyes on your own paper. Mr. Whalen. May I be excused? Wait. I think I forgot my shorts. I think I have an extra pair. - Do you have an extra shirt? - I might. We can go to the bathroom... Hey! No running in the hallways! Jonathan, get back here! Oh, my God. Happy Halloween, my pretty. - Little early for chocolate, no? - Mm. You're talking to someone who eats Count Chocula on a regular basis. Can we not talk about cereal? Please? Okay. Someone's in a mood this morning. Sorry. Barely slept last night. Let me guess. You were up until 4:00 in the morning, working on that Halloween costume again. Actually, it was more like 6:00. Did you guys hear about Monica Brown this morning? Ugh! That bitchy talk show host? Yeah, that bitchy talk show host totally got her face torn off. What? Okay, get this. So, she had that Miles County survivor on. Do you remember the one who was in the coma and her face was all mutilated? What's her name? It was like, I don't know, Victoria or something. - Victoria Heyes? - Yes. She had a meltdown on the show, right? And then backstage, she went full-on psycho, and mauled Monica Brown with her bare hands. - No way. - Oh, my God. Is she dead? I mean, if she's lucky. What? You ever see photos of those transplant faces, looking like Mr. Potato Head? - Fuck that shit. - God, is it really that bad? Well, I haven't seen photos. But from what I hear, she kinda looks like the inside of my cookie. Her eyes are all gouged out. And her nose was like falling off of her face. Oh, my God. And I heard that her cheek like a little bit, was found at the bottom of Victoria Heyes' shoe. You okay? Sienna? Hey, you all right? I really didn't mean to freak you out with that Monica Brown shit. - I'm so sorry. - No. - You okay? - I'm okay, I'm okay. I'm fine. I just... I just need a second I think. Hi. Excuse me. Can you mind your own business, please? Thank you. My God. Sienna, talk to me. What's going on? We had... we had a fire last night. - What? Where? - My room. I must've fallen asleep with the candles burning. - It was pretty bad. - Okay. How bad is "pretty bad"? Like flames touching the ceiling, entire house could have burned down bad. - Jesus. Is everyone okay? - Yeah. Yeah, yeah. No, my mom put the flames out in time. Wow. Fucking Barbara to the rescue. I swear that woman's a superhero. - Was she pissed? - Livid. Berated me for a good hour and a half this morning. I mean, that's not so bad. I mean, you did almost torch the whole family in their sleep. Look. The important thing is that nobody got hurt. Right? Seriously, in a few weeks, you'll be laughing - about the whole thing. - More like months. - Okay. A couple months. - Probably a year. It wasn't just the fire. It... Something really strange happened last night. What? Nothing. Nothing. I'm fine. - You sure? - Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, no, come on. Um... Let's... let's go back. Now, that my food is probably ice cold. You want a piece of my Monica Brown cookie? - Brooke. - Sorry. I hate you. Thank you, Officer. I'm so sorry to cause you trouble. No problem. Have a nice day, ma'am. You, too. - Get to your room. - But mom, I... Go to your room. I don't wanna hear another word out of you until I say so. I can't believe I'm reduced to a pair of cheap store-bought wings. You think these are too small? How big do you want 'em? You're gonna be knocking over people's drinks and shit all night. I think they're cute. Well, they're not terrible. You don't really have a choice. Ugh, it's my mom. Where did you tell your mother we were going tonight? Megan Melanie's Halloween party. Okay. I'll catch you out front. Okay. Hey, Mom. Good. No, I'm just in town with Sienna. What time are you gonna be home? Because... Sorry. I'm sorry. Nice. Nothing. I just ran into a man wearing terrifying clown costume. Can I help you find anything? Need any help? Uh, find everything okay? Yeah. Mm hmm. I'm gonna need to scan those. Oh. Um, right. Sorry. It's all good. Okay. That'll be 32.25. Yeah, um... I think I left my bag downstairs. Sir. If you're gonna put that in your mouth, you gotta pay for it. Here you go. Thanks. You know what? I'm gonna go get you a big bag. Oh, no, no. I... I really... - I don't... I don't need it. - No, no, it's fine. I got 'em right back here. Okay. Please don't. Stop. Please stop! Please! Hey, buddy? You wanna quit causin' trouble? - Thank you. - Thank you. - Happy Halloween. - You, too. Yo, we closin' up, man. Can I help you find something? 8.99. Are you serious right now? Yo, can you pay for that or not? Sir, what are you doing? All right. Sir, you know what? I'm gonna call the police. Hey! Did you hear what I said? Get the hell outta here before I fuck you up. That's fucking crazy. I'm telling you it was him, Allie. Right down to the little black dot on the tip of his nose. Sienna, you said it yourself. I mean, there are gonna be hundreds of douche bags dressed up as that psycho tonight. Even your brother was talking about going as him. Not that I'm calling your brother a douche bag. It's just a coincidence. Then how do you explain the fire? I dreamt it and it happened. Did you change medications recently? Jesus Christ. I'm not crazy! Take a breath. I... I'm just saying, did you ever consider the logical explanation that maybe the fire caused your nightmare, not the other way around? What? I think that the fire started while you were sleeping. And it worked its way into your nightmare. I mean, your body must've felt the flames. You know shit like that happens all the time. Look, are you getting candy or what? I mean, what are... What are we doing here? Even if that is the case, it doesn't explain how the fire started. Come on, honey. Oh, my. They're closed. - Wow. - Oh. Look at that, Mom. Yeah, that's wonderful, honey. Cool. All right. Let's go. Let's go. You're just gonna stay here the whole time. Come on. We don't go direct with our insurers. Okay, but let me get your zip code. I'm gonna find a broker in your area. What are you doing home? He's here, Sienna. Who? The Miles County clown. What are you talking about? I saw him today in my school. Just like in the police photos. Slow down. It was him. Something really bad is gonna happen tonight. Is that Daddy's sketchbook? Look here. How long have you had this? Jonathan, answer me. You know how long we've been looking for this. Read this. I saw her today. This exact girl. Only she didn't look human. There's some kinda connection between her, the old carnival, and the Miles County clown. Something really bad's gonna happen tonight. I know it. Did you put these in here? No. But look at this. It's him! Daddy drew this? That's not all. What if you're connected, too? What? Jonathan, you're acting crazy. You're acting crazy. Okay? He created this character for you. He gave you that sword right before he died. It's like he saw this coming. Daddy drew a lot of things for me. He bought me tons of shit. Seriously, what's wrong with you? - Do you even hear yourself? - What's going on in here? Did he show you this? She doesn't care. She's just pissed, 'cause I might get suspended. Suspended. For what? Oh, you didn't tell her? Your brother brought a dead animal to school this morning. - What? - Yeah. A dead animal. Can you believe it? He vandalized the halls. I almost had a fucking heart attack when they told me. It wasn't me. It was the clown. The little girl brought it in. I don't wanna hear another word about this goddamn clown. He was covered in blood on his shirt and his hands when he got here. The principal literally caught you red-handed. That's 'cause he threw it at me. I should've listened to you. You have been telling me over and over again about this kid. I'm calling Dr. Schiffrin on Monday. I'm putting a stop to this now. And put your goddamn bowl in the sink. I'm not telling you again. It was him. You gotta believe me. Jonathan. It was... It was probably just some kids at school, messing around. It's the one-year anniversary. I mean, I already saw some... jerk wearing that same costume in Abracadabra an hour ago. What about these drawings and these articles then? We both know what happened to Daddy. Okay, none of this was his fault. And all of these ugly things in here, that's not who he was. He loved you... very much. It's gonna be okay. - Stay home tonight. - Jonathan. Please. I'm begging you. - Nothing's gonna happen. - Fine. Just don't act surprised when a bunch of people get killed tonight. Have you ever... I believe him. About what? I don't think he vandalized the school. Oh, now, you believe him? Yesterday, he was the Zodiac Killer. What's changed? Get the door. Restaurants on the East Coast have recalled romaine lettuce due to a recent E. Coli outbreak. At least 12 people have been hospitalized and two are in critical condition. - Hi. - Trick or treat! Happy Halloween. Oh, I love your makeup. Oh, she did it all herself. Wow! Great job. What do you say? Thank you. You're welcome. - Bye. - Bye. Ah, aren't you a little old to be trick or treating? Wait a minute. Aren't you that guy from the costume shop? You are? What are you doing here? Oh. Seriously, do you live around here or something? Hmm. You're really weird, you know that? Yeah. Look, I get it, dude. The whole creepy, silent mime gimmick. I mean, it's very effective. And the blood is a nice touch also. Yeah. I can't give you anything. No, I'm sorry. Really. No... no candy for grownups. Come on. Go away. Seriously, asshole, go bother somebody else. Are you kidding me right now? I said, get out of here. I mean it. Wait. So, if I give you candy, you'll leave? Fine. Here. Happy Halloween. In other news, talk show provocateur, Monica Brown is still in critical condition this evening, following a violent attack which took place at KLA Studios earlier today. The TV host was violently assaulted in her dressing room after a live broadcast with guest Victoria Heyes. Heyes is the sole survivor of the Miles County massacre of 2017, which left eight people dead and Heyes in critical condition. The 20-year-old was arrested at the crime scene, and taken into custody by authorities. The interview sparked controversy upon its announcement given Brown's exploitative tendencies. Heyes was released from St. Michael's Hospital yesterday evening after months of rehabilitation and psychoanalysis. Like you, Sienna. Halloween is officially here, and thousands are lining up for the parade in New York City's East Village. Weather conditions are expected to be cold and rainy, so dress warm if you're planning to attend. No! No! No! No! No! No, no! Johnny! You're still afraid. Stop it now. I mean it. They're coming to get you, Barbara. Well? Stop it! You're ignorant. They're coming for you, Barbara. It's revealing. Stop it. Three months' worth of work, and all you can say is it's revealing? Your tits are practically popping out. They are not! They are! Turn around. Here he comes now. Johnny! You know what I was making? It's Daddy's character. Yes, but seeing it on paper and seeing it on your daughter are two different things. You look like you're going to a strip club. Mom, this is how people dress on Halloween these days. Do you have any idea how much work I put into this? You did an excellent job. But when did Halloween become synonymous with sex? You're such a prude. Okay. That's my ride. Later. Sienna. Dad would have loved it. Bye. Allie! Have you been handing out candy? That bowl is still filled to the brim. Allie! Oh, my God. Allie? Allie? Allie, answer me. Where are you? Allie? Oh, no! No, no! No! No! Mom. What'd I tell you? I never doubted you for a second. Come on. Let's go get fucked up. What can I get you guys? Uh, vodka and coke, please. What do you want? Off your phone. What do you want? Uh, rum and coke. Mixed. Also, can we have two shots of whiskey, please? Thank you. Has Allie texted you back yet? No. Well, can you check? Negative. You know this isn't like her. It's fine. Just relax. And have a good time for once in your life, okay? Maybe if I just text her mom, she will get back to me. No. Off your phone. - Phone down. - Okay! - Look, we're gonna have fun. - Mm hmm. - Stress-free environment. - Yep. - Take this. - Okay. - Let's go. - All right. Thank you. Will you excuse me? Sorry. Oops! - Let's go. - Okay. Yep. Okay. To a great night with my girls. - To a great night. - Happy Halloween. Oh, God. Oh, you're such an amateur. I do not know how you drink that shit. Well, chase it. Oh, you asshole! Happy Halloween, baby. You look hot. Oh, yeah? You like my hair? I do. How long did that take? You don't wanna know. Ooh! Yeah, nice shirt. Wishful thinking. I bet! Oh, Jeff. This is my best friend Sienna. Hi. Wow. That is a badass outfit. Thank you. This girl is unbelievably talented. You have no idea. She made this whole thing herself, head to toe. What did it take you, like five months? No. It didn't take that long. Yes, it did. You have no idea. It took forever. You are unbelievable. You know, honestly, I feel upstaged. Okay. Could you guys please stop? You're making me feel a little self-conscious, so... Oh. Well, a couple of shots will help that. - Oh! Shots! Shots! Shots! Shots! - Shots! Shots! Shots! Shots! No. No, no, no. I cannot drink anymore tonight. My mom will get so pissed if I get fucked up. No, she won't! Your mom's gonna be asleep in two hours. I can't do it. Okay, fine. Take a picture of us. Okay. Ooh, let's dance! Okay. - Trick or treat! - Trick or treat! Kids, look how cool! Oh my God! So cool. Ew. Why is mine so sticky? Don't worry. It's just fake blood. Just put it in the bag. Ooh, I like it. Ew. All right, thank you! - Thank you! - Thank you! Let's go. Happy Halloween! - Happy Halloween! - Happy Halloween! What are you doing in here? You wanna watch a movie? There is a lot of candy leftover downstairs. Come on. I'll let you stay up late. Go away. Jonathan. I am sorry that your plans were ruined tonight. I really am. But you should've thought about this before you pulled that shit in school today. I mean, enough's enough. I told you the truth. - I'm not doing this again. - It wasn't me! Well, if it wasn't you, then I sincerely apologize. But I just don't believe you anymore. What about this? Again with this fucking book! Why was Daddy collecting these news articles? "Slain girl found at carnival." And this? Look at these drawings! This isn't like Daddy! He was sick. Why can't you understand? He didn't know who he was, or what he was doing half the time. And this. This bullshit is nothing but a fucking reminder. No! I want this out of my house. You're such a bitch! Don't you ever say that to me again! Jonathan. Jonathan, you get back here. Jonathan! I'll be right back. Wait. Where are you going? I'm gonna grab a drink. - Yo, can I get a selfie? - Sure. Fuck, yeah, girl! What? What? Oh, my God. Sienna! - Hey! - Hi! I missed you, girl. Hi. No, wait. - Feel this. - Oh. Oh. - Oh, my God. - No, no. Wait. You don't understand. I want it. - I know. - I wanna like... live in it, you know? - How are you feeling? - Good. Yeah? - So good actually! - Okay. I feel like... that shot's really starting to hit me. Well, whiskey will do that to you. - I needed this. - Yeah. You were right. - You were so right. - Yeah. I needed to just, like get out, and stop thinking, worrying about every little thing in my life. Like... like this costume. Yeah. I mean, it should be a happy thing. - Yeah. - You know? It reminds me of my Dad. He used to... He used to draw this character for me when I was a little girl. He used to tell me I was gonna grow up to be like her one day. And I really believed it. Well, look at you now! You are her. I am nothing like her. I'm not courageous. I'm not brave. I mean, I literally had a panic attack today in school in front of everybody. I put molly in your drink. What? I did. I put a half a tablet in your drink, the other half in mine. Not even really, it was kind of nothing. But it's fine, 'cause I'm also on it. So, we're totally fine. You and me. And that is why you feel like you're on molly. 'Cause you are. Right now. You fuckin' bitch! What the... - That is so messed up! - I did it. I made you feel better, didn't I? I'm fucking pissed. No, don't be pissed. You're smiling. You can't be pissed. No, bitch. I'm not smiling. You're totally smiling. So, we gotta go back out, and we gotta dance. Jonathan. Jonathan, please get back. Jonathan! Oh, shit. What? My mom called me like six times. - Ooh. Do not call her back. - I'm gonna see... - Don't call her back! - Shh, shh, shh! Sienna. Sienna. - Sienna. - Hey! - Stop it. - He's dead, Sienna! Wait. What? Cut the call. Wait, mom. Mom, I can't hear you. Just... Um, sorry. Um, what'd you say? He covered the entire fucking car with shaving cream! What? Yeah! The whole fucking thing. Shaving cream, toilet paper, eggs. He's dead! He... Jonathan wouldn't do that. Yeah. He didn't do this. Just like he didn't vandalize the school this morning! Look at this. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. This... this is crazy now. He's going to that psychiatrist immediately. I cannot deal with him anymore. Really, mom? You're gonna send him to a shrink because what, he put like a little bit of shaving cream on your car? I'm glad you think this is funny, Sienna. It's just shaving cream. It's not like he took a baseball bat to your windshield. It's Halloween. I mean... Are you drunk? - No. - Yes, you are. I can hear it in your voice. How many drinks have you had? I... I thought we were talking about Jonathan. Sienna, so help me, if you come home plastered on top of everything else - I'm dealing with tonight... - No. I swear to God, I'm not drunk. I'll even take a breathalyzer. You're killing me. You know that? You and your brother both, I have had it. I love you. Yeah, Sienna, I am warning you. No. Really, mom. I... I love you. I... I don't say it enough. I love you, too. Go and enjoy your party. I'm... I'm sorry to bother you. And listen. Everything will be okay with Jonathan. I promise. Just remember what I said. Be careful getting home, all right? I will. Bye. Happy Halloween, motherfuckers! - How'd it go? - Fine. All right. Let me give you a little molly etiquette here. Rule number one, you never ever call your mother when you're rolling on molly. Okay? Your mother, never. All right? Rule number two, you don't fucking let it go to waste. Come on. Look at this. Did he really think he was gonna get away with this? He is in for a rude awakening.

I'm on the same shit as you right now, okay? - I'm not freaking out. - Whoa! What are we talking about here? What shit? I put a pinch of molly in her drink. It was nothing. - Plus Xanax. - What? I did not give you Xanax. No, she was already on Xanax, which I didn't know about, okay? Let's make that perfectly fucking clear. You could've fucking killed me. I was trying to do something nice for you. Jesus Christ! You're like Ms. Morbid all the time. Thanks. Just take me home. Sienna, whatever happened back there was not normal. Okay? You could have had like a brain aneurysm, or seizure, or something. What if it happens again? Wanna take her to the emergency room? I... I just... I just wanna go home. Just take me home. If that's your mother, do not answer it. Hello. Sienna, I'm in trouble. Oh, you think? Mommy told me what you did to her car, you little asshole. I mean, really? No. I need your help. You have to come get me. What do you mean? What's wrong? Where are you? I'm at the old carnival. Eric and Sean left me here. I'm all alone. What's wrong with you? Please. I'm really scared. I don't know what else to do. I can't call mommy. Okay. Um, all right. Calm down. I'll come get you, okay? Hurry, my phone is dying. All right. Just wait by the main entrance, okay? Jonathan? Jonathan? J... Goddammit. He's bullshitting you. No, he's not. Yes, he is. It's Halloween. Are you really telling me right now that it's beneath your brother to do something twisted like this? Come on. The old carnival. No. I... I know when Jonathan's lying. Okay? I... I could hear it in his voice. Something's... something's wrong. Sienna! Like, dude... It's only a few miles from here. This is so stupid. Great. Fine. Whatever. I don't care. It's not like this night can get any worse. Well, where is he? I told him to wait in front. - How old's your brother? - 12. Even the fact that he's out here right now should be telling you something. Didn't like a little girl get murdered out here a couple years ago? I'm gonna go look for him. What? Sienna? Get back in the car. Sienna! She's crazy. Jonathan! Jonathan! Maybe we should go with her. Fuck that. I guarantee you, her brother's just gonna scare the shit out of her. He's turned into a complete psycho ever since his father killed himself. Ever since what? No joke. He had like this giant brain tumor that I don't know, it just made him do all this fucked-up shit. And he was like seeing things. And he got really abusive towards the end. Especially towards Sienna. And then one day, he drank a whole bottle of Jack, and he got in his car, and he drove straight into one of those transformer things. And the car caught fire, and he got trapped in the wreck. And he burned to death. You could hear him screaming from a mile away. Well, I've only known your friend for a few hours, but that explains a lot. Yeah. All things considered, I think she's doing pretty well. Come on, answer me. Where are you? I'm searching all over the place. Help. Jonathan, can you hear me? I can't... Listen. I'm gonna wait for you by the merry-go-round, okay? Did you hear what I said? Meet me at the merry-go-round. Hello? Text me back. What is that? A little pick-me-up. Wow, Jeff. Okay. Don't let Sienna see that shit. Well, we'll just have to do it before she comes back. I'm not doing that. You ever try it? Yeah. Once. I didn't like it. Oh sure, impossible. Come on. This will put us right back in the club. Fuck. Trust me. Okay. All right. Fuck it. Um... okay. Ugh! That tastes weird. Jonathan? What's wrong? Where the hell is she? Who cares? Wait. All right. Look, but, like, seriously, what time did she leave? - Well, who cares? - Okay. Okay. I'm gonna call her really fast, okay? Just really quick. Where are you going? I have to go pee-pee. You wanna hold it? Ew. Leave. Hi. It's Sienna. Leave a message, and I'll get back to you. The mailbox is full... Unbelievable. ...and cannot accept any messages at this time. Goodbye... Asshole! That's twice! Oh, it's so funny. Yeah, you're so funny. You know what's actually really funny? - Mm. - Mm. Let me see here. Oh. Oh, hey. Don't fuck her up. - Come on. - Oh. - Oh, you better say sorry. - I'm sorry. And I don't really know if you can snort this out of an ashtray. It'd be kinda hard to snort out of. I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I won't do it again, I promise. Are you actually sorry? Hey. Okay, fine. But you're a jerk. Jeff? Oh, my God! No! No, no! No! No, no! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Sienna! Oh, God! Sienna! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Jonathan! Can you hear me? Somebody, please! Help me! Sienna! Help! Brooke! Oh, my God! No, please! No! Stay back. Stop. Please stop. Stay away from me! Don't, please! Wait, wait. No! Please, please stop! No! No, no, no, no! Stop it. Stop. No. Please! No. Stay back. Don't... don't come near me. Please don't. No, no, no! Brooke! Brooke! Brooke. Jonathan? Jonathan, run! Come on. This way. Sienna. You're hurt bad. I'm all right. I'm all right. Let me... let me see you. Are you okay? Oh, my God. You were right. You were right about everything. I was right about you, too. About what? They used me to get you here. They need you in this place for a reason. What are you saying that? It's what Daddy saw. I think you're the only one who can stop him. Why? I don't know. Well, we gotta find a way out of here. Okay, come on. Wait here. Jonathan. Sucker! Jonathan... Sienna! Sienna. Sienna, wake up. Stay with me. Stay with me! Please don't go. Sienna. Please don't leave me. Sienna. Baby, wake up. Mom? Sweetie, it's okay. You're safe. Mom. Oh, shh, shh, shh. Everything's gonna be okay. I thought I was never gonna see you again. Oh. Jonathan told you... didn't he? What? Sienna! Get away from her! That's not Mommy! Jonathan! No! No! No! No, you tucker! Fuck you.
