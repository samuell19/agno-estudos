I'm bloody busy! Tomas? Where's Dad? Your dad's not here, son. Well, when will he be back? I don't know. The story around is that we've gone broke. And Ted's done a flit - shot through to Perth. We were going to team up. He wouldn't go west, anyway. - This place looks... - Shit house. Was he staying straight? We're straight. Alright?! That's our trouble. We were just getting on top of it when this insurance bloke pulled the plug on us. But he was staying away from that business. They put it on us, son. And your dad... told them to shove it. Alright! Who are you?! No! No, no, no, boys. No. It's alright. It's Ted's son, Steve. That's Wimpy and Rabbit. Have you come down to drive that piece of shit outside, have you? Yeah. Pick your nose with that?

Beat it. Goes better on fire, does it? Only with me in it. Hey! We're in business. Well, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls. It's a beautiful night for racing. There's a little breeze, but all in all, a balmy summer's night indeed. 'Race Car World'. "Speedway Star'. 'Race Car World'." OK. You blokes want something to eat? Just watch the fuel gauge, Steve. Just warm it up. The track could be very greasy. Hey. How are you going? How's business? Got time to watch the race and everything? We're short on 'dogs. Well, sell them chips. Rabbit!

The finalists for this year's Miss Speedway Queen. Come on. Let's hear it for these girls. They're working their arses off tonight. First of all, let's meet last year's winner. There she is - the beautiful Janelle Clapton. Janelle, take a bow. Hey, Janelle! Show us your tits! Wimp. And she's from Sunshine Heights. She wishes all the girls in this year's group every success, and she wishes they could all win. That's a lovely thought. OK, our first finalist is the beautiful and tantalizing Miss Jacinta Sidebottom. Take a bow. There she is. Isn't she beautiful? What a figure! Makes your mind boggle, really. Now, Jacinta's 18 and she's from Canterbury Waters. She's a doctor's receptionist and she loves music. Actually, she plays a bit of Spanish guitar. In fact, she plays every Saturday night at the El Toro Blanco. She'd go better if she went on eight! Eight, you reckon, Steve? Don't you touch it! You'll foul it up! Listen, why does everybody talk filth around here, Tomas? Doesn't anybody eat?! Bloody cheap! Oh, Steve. This is a friend of ours. Ruth Mintos. Hi. I know what it takes for the drivers, mate. Turn it off, Steve. Off. Hey, Janelle! Over here! See you all later on, OK? At my place. Do you know Sophie Mintos? Yeah. She's my cousin. Sophie Diaz. She's married now. Jeez. We were at school together. You start young down here. Why are you so slow? I guess it's the weather up north. Mustard or sauce? Mustard. Mustard?! Will you hurry and get me a plug?! What, are you deaf or something?! Do you work here? Raced here before? No. First time. OK, fellas. Tum them loose. Send them out. Hold this. Don't go away. Grab it! Well, there goes his concentration. Are you working or jerking?! Coming. God, now you've got his hot dog, he's going to have to get serious. Shut up. Get set for top speedway action. My name is Allan Edworthy, and of course, as always, our co-commentator is Mr Wayne Grubb. Thanks, Allan. We're all looking forward to a big night of speedway. I know I am, Al. It looks a bit that way, from all the top contenders lined up, and we look forward to a real fast night of racing. - We certainly do. - Mate, did you see those bikinis? We're all set to go now, looking closely as the cars come out for heat number one. OK, getting set to go. Five laps, the journey. The opening heat of the sprint cars, brought to you by Bob Jane. Looking for a start this time, as they come off turn four. Arthur Cowan has the green at the ready. OK. We'll try again, as they run out of turn four. Up comes the green. They're racing now! And Rush, Black law and Tatnall all drive into turn one. Steve Hall is there also, looking for the way through. Rush still the leader as they run down the back fence. Tatnall looking for the outside run on Black law. Guess what? Steve Hall's still there. Go, Steve! Go! Go! Go! Go! Hall is there. Black law. Rush still the leader. Go! Come on, you rat! Ping them! With Rush leading. This boy from Toowoomba is boxing tonight! Hall's on the outside now, while Blacklaw's taken high up, on the fence, followed through by Tatnall. Steve Hall's pushing it hard now... Rush still the leader! Hall's going for the big one on the outside. There's the black-and-white at the ready, but Rush will win! Hall comes in for second. Hey! We've got a qualifier! Mate! Whoopee! He can race like a rat. Go for it, Steve! Allan, it looks like the newcomer, the 'Typhoon from Toowoomba' - that's in Queensland, folks... Tomas. I've got to go back to work. I'll see you later. Pardon? Got to go back to work. 'Bye. "Bye, possum." Good on you, Steve! You little ripper! Bloody beaut, mate! We're going to do it! Maybe. Yeah! Who? Where is she? She's gone back to work. Hey, you qualified? Yeah. And you came second! That's pretty good! Well, how did it go? Gone, mate. She's gone? Done a Cinderella on you, mate? It's the Catholic in her. If they're not home by 12:00, it turns them into pumpkins. OK! Deaf Czech. Wakey-Wakey! Tucker time! Don't touch him, Wimp. He's sleeping in. Hey. Hey. Why'd you do that, mate? We were going to let him sleep in! Morning, star! What are you doing? Nothing. Who are you looking for? Haven't you got anything else to do? You're looking for Ruth. You won't find her.

Did you get me that fizzy stuff? He's ringing Ruth. Well, he doesn't need you leering over him, does he? Here. Out. Yeah. Get. Piss off. - Hello? - Hello? Ruth? No, this is her mother. Who are you? Steve Hall. What do you want with her? I wanted to talk to her. Mum, get off the line. What do you do? Mum, it's none of your business. Ruth? Mum... Hello? Steve? Yeah, look, I was wondering if you were working today. Oh, no. No, it's Sunday. I'm sorry. It's not your fault. Alright! Sprung. I was kind of hoping you could show me around. Yeah, OK. Sure. OK. Well, I'll pick you up in half an hour, then. Yeah. But I'll meet you around the corner. OK. Sure. OK. See you later. Well. How did you go with Maria? Ruth's mum. HOW'D you go? I don't know. She's a bit hard to make sense of. What's this? A little something to tide yourself over with. I can't take this. Don't be stupid. It's Ted's half for the month. Don't worry, you'll be earning it. Ta. And what are you doing today? I thought I might take her around and see if anyone's seen Dad's car. Just you be careful who you are talking with. Alright? Alright. Off the duco. Come on. Come on.

Hey put them on there. On there. Put them on there. Look, I didn't come here to talk about work. Well, didn't Ruth's mum tell you? We want to get married. Has she met you? No. But I just want someone to know that we're fair dinkum. “Fair dinkum... How can you be serious? You're both kids. We love each other, Uncle Harry. That's more than a lot of people start with. Ruth, first you're asking me, now you're telling me. Yeah, we are. Well, slow down! Give up the driving for a while and get something behind yourself. Why should he?! When Steve's on the track, it's the other people that are behind... Sophie, I asked for black. Well, I didn't hear you. Uncle Harry! I've got nothing more to say. That went great, didn't it? That was good, for Harry. Jesus. I'd hate to upset him. He'll come round. It's his new secretary. What? He's not getting enough sleep. Who is? Well, let's start the evening with a big bang. And this wonderful firework display is brought to you by... First two heats are on the board. Newcastle meeting is off tomorrow night. Here comes the Mafia. I have to change these brake pads. Change your underpants while you're at it! G'day. How are you? How are you? Alright. Listen, it's alright. I've got your mother here. She's on the hill. Mum? It's OK. Really. She wants to meet him. It's alright. Listen, be patient. Alright? Yep. For sure. Coming? How are you, Harry? G'day. How are you? Can I talk to you for a minute? Sure. Don't get dirty, Harry. What's the trouble with you, Harry? No trouble for me. So, it's a big night for racing. Settle back and enjoy speedway at its best, right here... The fastest circuit on the east coast of Australia. What's the kid like? How is he? Good? Steve? He would give you the shirt off your back. Here. You put this on. You'll get dirty. - Come over here! - Alright! Give me a hand. Do you come to speedway often? Sometimes. Have you raced here much? Just once before. Do you love her? Yeah. I don't want to take her away. You couldn't. She can't cook. She'd kill you, the first meal. See? I told you it would be alright. Hadn't you better be getting back to work? See you, Soph. 'Bye, Mum. OK, they're all set to go, and the line-up looks good. So, it's over to Allan for the actual start. Thanks, Wayne. They're forming up into rows of two. We should have the start next time around. All eyes on the starter now, the flag being held aloft. Let's pick up the lights now as they get set to charge. Coming onto the main straightaway - there's the green! Racing now, as they head up into turn one, and the field is locked in tight! Up with turns one and two. Heading down the back section now, and Rush again taken into the lead. Now, as they squeeze off the back section, coming back onto the main straightaway, oh, gee, it's really tight now with these race cars. Into the 12-lap turn. Kevin Worthington dives on the inside. Also, now, as they run off the back section, we can see Steve Hall in there. He's gone! There's a big one! A big one on turn one! And there's a pile of metal and cars everywhere! All over the circuit now! And there's the red light! - I'll get your gear! - Here! Catch! Steve! Will he be alright? The car's badly damaged... Come on! Off of there! Well, it looks like time's running out, folks, especially for car 47. And this is where the pit crews demonstrate their skills. With six laps still to go, there's no chance for car 84. But with two minutes to restart, it's all hands to the pump for those drivers still stranded on the track. What can I do for you? There's a bit of talent there, Allan. And it looks like the Typhoon from Toowoomba has actually blown out. Get it fixed, OK?! 30 seconds left to go. Some teams go home early, and that's the great thing about speedway. 20 seconds left. No!! It isn't fair! Just enough time to get a Grubb's Heavenly Hotdog. But, Wayne, isn't the time always right for Grubb's grub? It certainly is, Allan. 15 Inches of Heaven that will fill a rumbling tummy. Brought to you by the girls who care - Carol and Sue Lee. Jesus Christ! Stop! I don't know what's happening out there, but this race is still alive until the officials can clear the track of this unauthorised entry and the race cars can complete 10 laps. With 5 laps completed at the time of the stoppage... Get your hat on and get back in the race! Rush, Black law, Tatnall and... and, yes, Steve Hall, whose brilliant crew have managed to beat the 2-minute limit, with, I might add, a little help. And it looks like my co-commentator, Mr Wayne Grubb, could be doing a few laps himself tonight, folks. There's the all clear, however, as the cars move away once again to form up for the recommencement of racing, into rows of two, in preparation of greeting the starter for the remaining laps of this event, now. Forming up, as we pick them up down the back section. Looking for a start, but the starter says no. They form up down the back section. Should get the green this time around. Onto the main straightaway. Racing now! Arthur Cowan throws the green! Up into turn one, it's wheel to wheel! Right up high on the banks and swinging down the back section, early race leader is Black law, but Steve Hall's on the move. Steve Hall coming through from the back. Inside he comes now, heading down the back section. Getting set to run through turns three and four. Moves up to get Worthington and goes right by Worthington. On the inside now, and he's after the early leader, George Tatnall. Moves up to Tatnall now, on the inside also, and goes by Tatnall. And Steve Hall! Look at him go! Steve Hall, off turn four now, is slipping away! Makes the final run to the black-and-white. And Steve Hall! Hall crosses the wire first! It's back, then, to Tatnall. Next to cross the wire, Black law. Further back down the back now, the remainder of the field as they cross the wire, but Steve Hall with a convincing win. We did it! We've only qualified for the final! - They probably know. - Yeah, I put it back too. - On you, Rat! - I'm pushing! Christ! Mate! You're a bloody thoroughbred, Steve. Bloody terrific! Garry Rush... Rob Worthington, and the very dark horse, the boy from the north, the Toowoomba Typhoon, Steve Hall. You're pushing it, Tomas. You work for us or you don't work. Not for as long as my arse points to the ground. Accidents can happen. Get out. If it was for me... But you see, there's other people involved. Get out. And besides, you've got junior over there to consider... Out! Just trying to be nice. Sprint car drivers, would you recheck the board for your positions? - Where's Tomas? - I don't know. - Hey. Where's Tomas? - I don't know, mate. Sprint car drivers, the second series of your positions is on the board. Don't touch it. You'll fuck it up. - You right? - OK! Let's move it out! Are you happy tonight? I'd be silly if I wasn't, hey? I don't know about you sometimes. Neither do i. Did you mean what you said? What? Tonight. Of course I did. Are you alright, then? I don't want you to take me home. Yet. I want us to be together. I love you. Where are they going to? I don't know, Wimp. Follow them. Wimp, pull over here. That's it. He's over 18. He can do what he likes, yeah? Her Mum's not going to like that. Wimpy, would you just shut up? Trouble. Trouble. Christ, that's cold! They turned the hot water off. Are you always this warm? Yep. Are you always this cold? No. Sorry. Are you alright, mate? What?! I... just saw the van. I thought you might have had some trouble. Do you want some licorice? A-are you taking Ruth home tonight? No! No, I'm not! Sorry, mate. Where have you been? Oh, nowhere. Just stretching my legs. It's cracked. You'll have to change it. You'll have to change it! You'll have to change your underwear. Change your...! Change his underwear! You don't smell like a rose yourself, Rabbit. There's no races left in that one. But... I just thought we could leave Dad's car in one piece. Hello? Do you want to race or what? You won't win any races sitting in this one. Sure. So? Mr Tomas Hrvrka? There's a lady on the phone for you. Lady on the phone for you, Tomas. Steve... about last night... What about it? What happened? N-nothing. Doesn't matter. What do you mean, “doesn't matter”? We're with you, you mug. Oh, both of us. Yeah. Oh, piss off. I don't service people on Sunday. - What a nice guy. - Who told you? What happened last night, Wimp? Nothing. Where are you? Sure. I'll be there soon. I have to go! Will you make sure that those two get to mass on time? Are you Mr Hrvrka? What's the trouble, lady? I've got something wrong with the back wheel. Oh, shit! Bastards! It's your lucky day! We've got a message for you, mate. Tell him, "Get fucked." The boss wants an arm. Don't push it too far or you'll end up in the same place as your mate. You killed Ted? You bastards! - Called your mum? - Yeah. She wants me home. She's crazy. You can come too, if you want. I reckon between Wimpy and your mum, we're better off here. Quick! Get out! Grab the extinguisher! Steve! Quick! Get out! It's inside still. Hold on. Look. Three weeks work. - Tomas! - Look what I found. Oh, God. What's happened? I reckon we've got some bastard worried. Right. Move. I thought we were going to stick it up them. If you're going to get even, you'd better make sure you get away with it. This is nothing. This is just a taste. Of what? Steve, they've done Ted. They've done him. Listen, isn't it time we stopped fucking around? Where do we look? It's Wayne. He's the spotter. And he's the messenger boy. See you later, Ron. Take it easy. Which one of you bastards killed my old man? Hey? I don't know anything about your old man. Come on. Come on. Come on. Hup! Howard did it! This is just a job to me! Take your clothes off, would you, tiger? What do you mean? Is he in there? No! How do we get in there? Come on! There's keys! They're no bloody good! Where else? - Come on! - After the railway... Come on! After the railway crossing. You go down a dead-end street. You can get in that way. Go over the sump. Where's Vincent? Hey?! He's... he's at his lodge meeting at the bloody leagues club! Shit! Janelle's working there tonight. Help! H...! What are we going to do with you, Wayne? Kill him! I've got my van! Get it over with. Ha-bloody-ha. No-one likes a smart-arse, Wayne. Shit, I didn't mean it, Wimpy. - Come on! Come on! Come on! - Hey! Wimp! You're a star! I think we should report a beached whale! It's OK. Come on, killer! Where are you? I'm bloody here! Alright. What do you want? Thank Christ you're here. You can find him. Find who? Wayne! I can't find him. He's disappeared with the paperwork. Shit. Who are you dialing? The police. You can't. I've got cars going interstate with no paperwork. Jesus. You'll find him, won't you? I mean, you'll know where he is. You're not going to the lodge party wearing that, are you? No. I've got my frock in the car. His frock in the car. Jesus Christ. - You're late! Where have you been? - Where have we been? They're onto us, mate! They're onto us! Hey? Wayne! What? Why won't he ring, mate? Where are they? Where are they?! Can't hear you. Where are the rest of them? Listen, you little ratbag bastard. You and all your mates are off. Do you hear that? Tomas! Think you're good enough on your own? Tomas! Tomas, he's a copper! Crawl, you dog! Crawl! Get inside! If anything happens to those kids, I'll kill you! Bastards! You're dead! You're dead, you bastards! Grouped geographically. If they're between 15 and 25, they're like Africa - half explored and half unexplored. 25 to 35, they're like Asia - hot, torrid and mysterious. 35 to 45, they're like America - streamlined, efficient, cooperative. What's up? It pays for the babysitter. They're like Europe - devastated but still good. Jan... see that bloke? Yeah. That's Vincent. You keep him here. For how long? Call Tomas when he leaves. But how? Give them something special. Hey? A bit extra. Put your hands together, with a big masonic welcome, for Janelle Clapton! A clap for Clapton! I love you. I love you. I love you. And respect you. Hey, that was a man. They'll talk. I want out. Not if they know what's good for them. Now, pull yourself together! We've got a party to organise. Steve, Pete. G'day. Frank. Frank. - And Joe. - A good night for it. - Up there. - You can get booked for this. Shut up, Rabbit. This is serious. Why do I have to stay here and look after the phone? Hey? - All aboard! - You right up there? Tomas has got hands. One hand, anyway. Get it off now! Everyone still on back there? Rabbit! Go back and shut the gate! Move those little noggy arses! Move! It's alright. It's alright. It's outside. Get out! Stay where you are! It's nothing! It's nothing! Stop, you bastards! You little fuckers! Hey! I've got to know what's going on. I'll drive. You're drunk. Bastards! - Stay and fight, you bastards! - Jesus Christ! Oi! There's a ramp at the other end! They're getting away! - Steve! Go the other way! - Block the ramp! Get him! They're coming through! Behind you! Look out! Shit! No! Trying to be smart? Go! Watch this. Suckers! Rabbit! Back up! Hey! Wait for it! Hey! Come on! Here she comes! Get out! Get out! Out of the way, Wimpy! Steve! I want this one. Come on. Get the cars in. Stop! Hold it! Pete! Eddie! Over here! We don't have to go in there. We don't have to know anything about it. Neither does anyone else. Well, I'm finished with it. Everyone's going to know. They'll know at the lodge. My bloody mother-in-law will know... Oh, shut up, you weak bastard! All they know is they're your best customers! Well, I'm finished with it! Listen, you wimp. We didn't set this up so you could piss off whenever you liked! Now, get a hold of yourself. Holy shit! Is that one of ours? - Stupid bastards. - I'm getting out. Hey, Howard, I'd better go with Dazza, I think... Jesus Christ. Shut up. How do you roll this? It's a bloody heap! I think it's time we cleaned out the can. Where are you going? I'm... I'm coming too. I'll sort out the dough. What are we hanging around here for? To tidy up your mess, sweetheart. Oi! Fuck-knuckle! Stupid bastards. Hey! Out there! Hey guys! Hey, hey, guys. I've got money. Come here! I've got money! I've got money! We can do a deal! Hey, come on. Come on. No, don't be stupid, fellas! Hey? Come on! Come on! Just give me a minute! Bloody stupid bastard. Oh, shit! Here. Leave some for the shit to stick. Boys, we'll be having an all-night party at the panel shop. - Steve! - He's back! You take my car. Oh, Steve! Are you OK? You and Ruth have been out all night, holding hands. It's over? Yeah, it's over. Pardon?
