♪ Piano ♪ Piano [Robbie]: I have had over 350 professional jumps. I hold over 20 world records. A head-on steam engine... Caesar's Palace... Building to building, thirty limos. You name it, I've jumped it. Since I started my career at 8 years old... If it can be jumped... I haven't ran outta ideas yet, I can jump it. I am the greatest jumper of all time. My name is Robbie Knievel. In my business you gotta know what the fuck you're doin'... or y'end up dead. [♪ Pounding funk-rock ] Doug Klang: Motorcycle jumping is a very short-lived career! Most guys don't last very long. Robbie is the only daredevil whose career has spanned five decades and he's still goin'. There's a lotta motorcycle jumpers out there. There's guys that can go farther. But there's a lot of people out there that could play guitar and sing better than Elvis Presley but who gives a shit? Doug Danger: Y'know, Robbie Knievel had the name but I don't care what you're born with for a name, you still gotta throw that leg over that bike, let that clutch out and fly. [Spanky]: He's did jumps nobody else has ever done. You know he jumped across the Grand Canyon. Jumped... And you can never talk about Robbie without talkin' to Evel. But he made his own way. [Mororcycle engine revving] Bob: I remember when... The crowd... went... ballistic. It was a moment. Rob: He was the ratings draw before American Idol. He was Robbie Knievel. ...to make those ratings. He built up this tremendous empire What ended up taking over his life was all the off-camera stuff. The booze, the trouble with the law. It robbed him of that notoriety. Gary: The two Knievel boys... Evel and Robbie... Possesshugeegos. Both of which need to be fed constantly. Eventually, it's not gonna work out. Lathan: The consequences of having a Knievel name, you're trying to outrun a legacy, a status larger than life. The guy who... He was the poster child for individuality. To escape that shadow is near impossible. Imagine being the son of that person. Robbie: My dad used to scream and yell a lot. And he liked to drink and he'd drink because of his nerves. He's a daredevil. It goes with it. Same with me. ...before you went out to talk to the crowd and get on that bike. Because you knew you could be dead in one second. It's like a rock n' roll star. It's entertainment. You're on the road all the time. There's people around you who wanna party. The jumps just got bigger. And the crowds and my entourage got bigger. And the parties got bigger. [♪ Pounding funk-rock ] [♪ Slow piano ] Robyn: Robbie and I were really close. I babysat him a lot. I did a lot of things with him. We skied together. We lived by each other. And I completely adore him. He would call and we would talk on the phone for hours. And I felt like we've lost that close connection and I'm, you know, hoping to get it back. I get a call every now and then and some texts but... Just that one-on-one, y'know, really good friendship, I miss that. So maybe he's been lost and he's tryin' to find his way. I don't know. Linda: I believe Robbie is trying to continue the legacy. And I can't understand it from his point of view. All I can think is he's a man who wants his father's approval whether he be alive or dead. And... The sad thing is that I think his father may have even been jealous of him when he made [heh] the jumps. He still chases Evel. That's all he's known what to do all his life. Alicia: He was my favorite when I was little. And he's just now sort of... coming back after like, twenty-plus years of being totally gone. So yeah, he's burned a ton of bridges. They're still burning, a lot of 'em. Joe: He is a gypsy, there's no doubt about it. I think he'd like to settle down and... Have a nice house. I dunno if he can. It seems like every time I talk to him, he was somewhere different. Constantly on the road, chasin' Evel. The Knievels are an interesting breed of... human being. Their blood's a little different than, than normal. No doubt. No doubt about it. Kathy: This motorhome that he's in now, and this is his home. That's his life. That's his home. I mean he can get up, move it when he wants to go. And Robbie's always been like that. You know what? Maybe 3 o'clock in the morning, he'll go: "I'm ready to leave." And he's gone. And where he goes you'll never know. Bill: Y'know, when you look back at it, Robbie was drinkin' by the time he was 12 years old. Four-and-a-half decades of it. Non-stop. And it progressively got worse. There was a demon and it ran with Robbie on his shoulder. I'm gonna be like you, dad. Well... If it would only have been the motorcycle jumpin' end of it, it woulda been great, but... That's not how it was. Robbie: It's been about 5 years since I've done a major jump. And before that I don't remember the last one. I've had my troubles... From drinkin'. And drinkin' has caused a lot of problems in my life. I ended up with pancreatitis 14 years ago. That killed a lot of people as soon as they got the cancer. The doctor gave me 3 to 5... in Daytona, the first time I got clean, if I didn't quit drinkin'. Well, I quit for a week. Then I started up again. It's been 14 years. And I've been in the emergency room about 14 times Once a year. But I kept drinkin'. And then not too long ago, was drinkin', got tired, fell asleep and I ended up in the back of a car. And he hit a car and he hit another car. And luckily nobody was injured. That's all in the police report. But, me, I'm still facin' charges. Newscaster: Robbie Knievel, son of legendary daredevil Evel Knievel, is facing DUI and criminal endangerment charges after he was arrested in Butte Tuesday night following a hit-and-run crash. Bill: One of the saddest days in my life. I couldn't believe what I was seein'. It was like I was looking at a 75-year-old guy that got arrested for hangin' out on the corner or somethin'. It wasn't the Robbie Knievel I knew. It was really sad to, to know that... Maybe the bottom has finally came. Kathy: The Butte police department called and they said he's booked in, he's not doing very well. Are you gonna be the one to come get 'im? So I said, "Sure." So I went up and I got Robbie and... It, uh... It was very sad. He, uh... Was just really detoxing. So I said to Robbie, "What do you wanna do?" And he goes, "Well, I just wanna go home." I said, "I'm not a doctor and I'm not a nurse." And I said, "Y'know Robbie, I think you're gonna die." Bill: Robbie was in such tough shape that... y'know, they had to bring him in and put him in the hospital to detox for uh, four days. But it was kinda hard on everybody, y'know? He, he wanted to be left alone. He was confused. He didn't know what his future brought. Kathy: His whole family tried to talk him into going to, like, a rehab. He didn't wanna do that. All Robbie wanted to do was - get back to work. Get back to work. "I need to make money. I need to get back to work." Linda: I still see anger in him. And I wonder if that's gonna surface or he's just got it under control now. I really wish that he could get that anger out of him. If he'd just read the Bible he'll be alright! Robbie: I'm just a human being. I'm not perfect. My feeling is, God has a plan for me. And I pray about it - quittin' drinkin' all the time. And I'd quit. I put myself in meetings back in '91. And I just couldn't stand the programs. And I just said, "I can't do this no more." It makes me wanna drink more." And I liked drinkin' because I was still jumpin'. And they went together. I'm gonna go risk my life. I'm gonna have a few drinks. I feel good... and have some fun. Just like my dad always used to say, and I realized it at an early age, the toughest competitor in life is death. Oh, I'm gonna jump. I'm gonna jump ramps. And I'm gonna keep jumpin' and I'm gonna keep believin'. 'N you have to have the guts to pull the trigger. And you gotta head for that take-off ramp at a high speed. My dad's passed away. I've carried the name on for so long, but there's only one Knievel. That's me. I'm like the last of the Mohicans. [♪ Surf rock instrumental ] Robbie: I was born May 7, 1962. And it was springtime. I always loved that birthday, 'cause... things were bein' born and flowers were bloomin' and I don't remember being born, thank God. Linda: I remember walkin' around the lot waitin' to... go into the hospital and Bob called my mom and she told me that he was in jail. He wasn't gonna be around. Wasn't really around for Kelly either, when he was born. He dropped me off at the hospital and left. That was four in the morning I guess. Robbie, it was four in the afternoon. He wasn't there. And he dropped me off at the hospital with Tracy, too! Robbie: Well where we lived, across the street first, in a real small trailer. And then moved to this trailer and we were pretty poor. You didn't understand that, where you lived... compared to, uh, say, a middle-class family. You just didn't understand. It was like, you had your trailer home here and your great grandmother's home here. Before I even got on a bicycle, of course my dad was... wheeling me up the street. I'm sittin' on a tank, hangin' on to a crossbar, on a big loud bike. And, uh, I was cryin'... I was scared. Linda: I think he was a fun dad to be around. The kids seemed to enjoy him a lot that way. So he wasn't home that much to be the "father" type. He never wanted to be like a normal average guy. Jeanne: Linda was a wonderful mother. I mean she took good care of the children and I think Bobby adored his children. It wasn't that he wasn't rough with them sometimes. I used to like to do my jump contests with the neighbour kids right here. I'd go all the way to the end of the street and start pedallin' my bicycle and I'd build a take off ramp about this high. Why did I have to beat every kid in the neighbourhood? Because I was Evel Knievel's son . And I wasn't lettin' any kid beat me... on a bicyle in a jump contest. No way. Robyn: You could tell right from the beginning that he was just full of it. He had that glint in his eye. Definitelya daredevil. From the beginning. Kelly: Well, out of the two of us, Robbie's definitely the daredevil. Now, I've fell down when I was real young ridin' motorcycles. Cut my arms and broke my knees and Robbie would just leave me in the dust. He just had a natural talent, and skill, and flair for it. He was just so much better at it than I was. Robbie: Bein' the son of Evel Knievel... And wantin' to follow in your father's footsteps... That's all I ever wanted to do ...was be like him. [♪ Quick piano ] Bill: There's a picture of Evel in the coach and he's gettin' ready to go jump and he's got a shot of Wild Turkey. And Robbie's lookin' up at his dad. "And I'm gonna be like you, dad, Y'know I'm gonna be like you..." Well, it turned out that he was just like him. Robbie: Before jumps, he'd be so nervous he'd take a shot of Wild Turkey and I'd sit there and watch 'im. And he says, "Drink that, a capful. That'll put hair on your chest." So I'd drink it. Ugh! Y'know, but... that was how I started growin' up. Tracey: My dad's drinking, it did affect us greatly but it was very complex. He was wonderful and loving and tender and compassionate. Yet, when he drank he could get... Mean and angry and loud and demanding. And scary at times. That was just kind of our norm and nobody really talked about it so, we just lived with it. Kelly: Everybody's dad drank in Butte, Montana. Not just my dad. Everybody's dad drank. I mean who the fuck doesn't drink? Everybody fuckin' drinks. You don't think any little kids see their dads drinkin'? Every little kid sees their dad drinkin'. Come on! [♪ Fast rock n' roll ] Doug Danger: My dad brought me down to Caesar's Palace. I was livin' in Las Vegas at the time. He said, "Some nut's gonna jump a motorcycle... Let's go watch!" I went up on my dad's shoulders and I watched Evel Knievel come along and, you know, I was just like, "C'mon, hurry up, get this thing over with." Doug Klang: It was one of the farthest jumps he'd ever tried. It was New Year's Eve 1967. But, It's well-documented; I've studied it. He just didn't have enough speed. And he clipped the safety deck and because he clipped the safety deck, it slammed him down really hard and just... threw him over the handlebars, and... he tumbled like a ragdoll. One of the greatest wreck footages ever. Bill: No one really thought he was gonna survive that. So when he went to the hospital, he was tellin' everybody he was in a coma. Well, he was never really in a coma. He played that situation out as long as he could to keep the press involved. That's how brilliant he was. That was the beginning of Evel Knievel. Robbie: When my dad crashed at Caesar's Palace in '67-'68, we're still livin' in a trailer. The things he did were just sooutta line at the time. Who is this guy? Kelly: I was 7 years old at the time so, from that point on, I mean, he was one famous guy and it changed our family. I mean thank God we were from a small town. My dad just had such a big imagination and wanted to go out and live every experience, every thing, that he could in life. Matthew: He signed a contract with Caesar's Palace to actually jump the fountains three times for $5000 a jump. Even the jump that catapulted him into stardom didn't even come close to coverin' the hospital bills. Robbie didn't grow up with a silver spoon in his mouth. That's for damn sure. Lathan: There's a postcard that Linda actually sent home. I've seen copies of it. She actually says "Bob's banged up pretty good." And I think that was probably the beginning of the end of the family relationship as far as he was a singular entity. He became the persona at that moment when he crashed at Caesar's Palace. Linda: Then he just got busier and busier. Celebrity is not the kind of life that I would want to pursue. Robbie has anger. Y'know, his dad used to travel and be gone 3 months at a time when he really got into it after the Caesar's Palace jump. And so he wasn't home with him y'know, to watch their baseball games or doing things with him like that. And that could be a lot part of it. Jeanne: It was hard on all of us. Fame took our children from us. At least that's what I saw. I'd have liked to spent more time with them but sometimes there just wasn't time. Kelly: When we were growin' up, I think my mom was really strong. Literally to stand up to somebody like Evel Knievel. She had her own quiet strength and I mean he was a lot to deal with. Not just because of his profession, but his... I mean his personality was like a freight train. I mean he could be really... Really overwhelming with us, y'know? And my mom had to get between us a lot. Linda: When Rob came home... Bob kinda started hollerin' at him I guess. And I can remember Robbie's words. I can't say 'em on the TV but... Why can't you just be my dad? And I've thought about that so much. I couldn't believe that... That he would discipline him the way he disciplined him. Bob musta thought, "Oh... You got Evel Knievel for a dad! And you're tellin' me to be a dad to you? What the heck?" He was insulted that his kid didn't think he was the greatest dad in the world! I just never dreamt that Bob would be... so abusive. Robbie: When I was real little, still livin' in the trailer... Y'know, there's a lotta hollerin' and screamin' and one time my dad came home hurt and he tripped over my fishin' pole. And I don't know if he'd had too many Olympia beers and he just started screamin'. "Who left their fishin' pole out?" He drug me out in the front yard and [Chuckles] Started smackin' me with his cane. And my Mom screamin' at him: "Stop it, stop it!" Bill: Evel was like a father to me. Only I didn't hafta... Stay around the house and take what Robbie got. Evel had a temper that was almost uncontrollable and when he got on a rampage, you knew it was time to get as far away as you could. Robbie took a lot a' that. He clashed with his father for some reason. It was an unbelievable relationship. I believe Evel was tryin' to be a father figure. But... when his father left and left him behind that was somethin' that was never ever gonna change Evel Knievel. And where we came from, in Butte, Montana, there was a lot of kids who didn't have dads. Chris: Tragedy is not something that Butte families were necessarily, not used to. Life's gonna get a little tougher. And in Butte, you keep hearing the words "Butte Tough" Sometimes that's the way you had to survive. Ellen: There was this incredible boom here calling workers from everywhere in the world. The miners that came here were overwhelmingly young. There were three men to every woman in this community And many of those women were living in the red light district And that created, I always say, it's like the Animal House. Chris: Drinking walked hand in hand with the culture of Butte. Butte people play as hard as they work and Butte people workveryhard. Matthew: If there was ever a place where you would expect a daredevil to come, it would be from a place like Butte where, the miners were daredevils in their own rights. You really were rollin' the dice every time you went to work. You get in a cage with six other guys and you'd have 'em lower you down into the pitch-black three, four thousand feet where cave-ins and explosions would kill people on a daily basis. Ellen: We found that one man a day died of silicosis or tuberculosis. And one man a week in a mining accident. That's 30 men a month, dying. It had a very profound effect on the culture of our community because it created so many widows. Chris: Evel Knievel, Robert Knievel. Here you've got a child who was raised on the edge of the red light district. Raised by his grandparents in a wide open, hell-bent-for-leather town that predicated itself on survival. And to think that somebody there would become a daredevil? I don't think it's surprising at all. Matthew: I think the first time that he got to see and start knowin' his father with any regularity woulda been when he was 9 or 10. His paternal grandparents who raised him would start bringin' him and his little brother Nick down to visit their dad in California for a few weeks every summer. Jeanne: He wanted to be with his father. And I think, you know, he probably didn't wanna blame his grandmother. So I think he took it out on his dad. Evel and his dad... Could clash. Bobby wanted to be with his father. And I think he wanted his dad to fight for him. I'll always believe that. He was always angry at his dad. Robbie: Over 90 days sober. It feels really good. I just feel...strong. I feel... My spirit that I grew up with and was raised with. I feel like I could go have a jump contest with anybody right now. So what I'm tryin' to do is just get through... all this. From the drinkin', drivin', the wreck. It really woke me up. And going to do a breath test every morning and every night is drivin' me crazy. I'm learnin' a lotta patience. It's not like I haven't been in trouble before but it's been a long time and to face something like this is kinda spooky and that wakes y'up too but... I'm at the age... And all the reckless life I've lived and lead... I'm tired of it. I've seen it all. I lived a life that was wild. And I'm just ready to... Settle. Work. Do what I do best. And be happy. I mean, life is short. It's time to just get away from that... Get away from that. The things I grew up with. Going to a bar everyday Or, you know, going to this shithole that doesn't mean nothin' Bill: When he started talkin' about jumpin' it was like... Boy... I was, I was not into it. I. I did not feel like takin' the bikes out. I did not feel like... Maybe I didn't want to be a part of it. I don't know. [Bill chatting on the phone] He hasn't been on a bike or jumped in four years. Well, you know, in five decades, that's the longest we've ever gone without a show. So we've been workin' for a couple weeks on gettin' Robbie a jump and have found some interest, which is really great that people are still wantin' to see the Knievels, the biggest name on two wheels, back out there gettin' with the program again. So we've been approached to jump at 'Evel Knievel Days' which is our hometown, Butte, Montana, and, uh, so we're gonna take it. Robbie: I'm trainin' hard, like I never have in probably 25, 30 years. It's all together and we're puttin' it together to be a great event for Evel Knievel Days which I haven't done since 2006 and to be like a headliner it feels great, y'know? And it gives me a chance to get back out there and show people I feel as young as I always did. Even better because I haven't had a drink in over 90 days. I'll go off that ramp till I don't know what age. The landing, I just have to worry about at the other end. But as long as I can do this, I am... Gonna be happy. Because this is what drives me because of whose son I am. Gary: In order for Robbie to come mainstream again with his jumping, at his age, is already a milestone. He's in his mid-50s. And how many people out there in their mid-50s are gonna be doing that kinda stuff? There's certainly a lot of other jumpers but they're all younger than he. I think now that he has, um... Quit drinking... Or at least I hope he has... That's certainly gonna work in his favour 'cause he's gonna approach things a little more sane I hope. [♪ Symphonic music ] Spanky: Y'know I kind of worry about Robbie, about stayin' sober. The problem is, there's a lot of pressure jumpin' motorcycles, or jumpin' anything, or doin' any stunt. So, sometimes maybe you wanna find the easy way out and kinda settle your nerves or whatever you wanna call it. And drink and try to forget about it until showtime. He tried to quit a few other times but it was very short lived. But this time I think it's the real deal and I really think he wants to go out there and jump, prove it to himself, and see all the things he missed when he was out there jumpin'. Hey, we're all prayin' for him. We'll see what happens. Bill: I woulda bet that he woulda started drinkin' again. But he's kinda proved to me that... Y'know, I'm talkin' to him everyday, That ,that's not gonna happen. That's not gonna be him. "I know where I have to go, Bill." "I know where I have to go." [Motorcycle engine roaring] Bill: "I've got 3 more years... Three years. To make what I need to make And go out the way I should go out,not the way I was." Is he gonna drink again? I'm saying "No." Rob: Alcohol's a slow killer. First, it will take everything you have and everything you love and if it hasn't killed you by that time, it eventually will. And I've told enough people, and I know it from experience, you will lose everything - if you're still alive. First it cost me probably some friends along the way, then it cost me my marriage, then it cost me my entire career, everything I'd worked hard for. It's humbling. Robbie is at an age right now where most of these people, if you're not in recovery, you're dead. He survived all these accidents, all these crashes, but what he doesn't maybe realize right now is he survived the biggest Grim Reaper and that's booze. When you decide to take the journey and drop the booze, one of the first things I said was, you know, the great thing is you get your feelings back, the bad thing is, you get your feelings back because the booze is gone. So how'm I gonna deal with the past? How am I gonna deal with the underlying trauma that caused me to drink? It's scary and you can't give up and the shit doesn't happen over night. [♪ Bluesy instrumental ] Robbie: He took me to Madison Square Garden. It was my first show with my brother. We basically just rode out on a bike three times the size of this. I remember going to Macy's, the biggest department store, lookin' for red, white, and blue tennis shoes and navy blue pants and a white sweatshirt 'cause I didn't have leathers then. That's what I performed on a bike twice the size of me and would wheelie across a football field. Spanky: Robbie could wheelie when he was a little kid. "Whoa, look at that little kid!" "Evel Knievel, Junior!" Robbie kinda stole the show even from his dad! Kelly: First time we ever performed with my dad, it was Robbie and I, we were in Madison Square Garden. Robbie of course probably wheelied by me with one hand for cryin' out loud! I just had no taste for it. Evel Knievel: Robbie, what the hell is this? Look at this. D'you wanna get hurt? Why don't you change that? You're not s'posed to have a brake lever like that. I want you to get that fixed before tonight. Y'understand? And make sure you wear that helmet. Lathan: He tried to create a family act but Robbie quickly became the eye of the tiger of the performing group. Kelly wanted to go in a different direction. Then you slowly saw Kelly fade away. In the next one,in Toronto, you saw less of Kelly and then at King's Island you only saw Robbie. Robbie: I knew at 11, I wanted to do what my dad did. And the older I got, I started buildin' higher and higher ramps in the yard. 4 feet high when I was a young teenager. And a landing ramp. Just got bigger from the bicycle jumps to the bigger bikes I rode to going further and buildin' bigger ramps. Linda: I didn't like it at all because I'd seen what Bob had been through and I was concerned about it, it always bothered me, but Robbie wanted to, and from then on, I think Robbie just loved that attention he was gettin'. He knew what he wanted to do then and that was it. Gary: He loved showin' off and he rode well. Evel... Every other month or every other year or whatever would change his opinion on how he felt about that. Evel was a hard one to read. Matthew: Evel Knievel was obviously this larger-than-life character that made him the perfect role model to be a superhero. Only this guy was real and it spilled over into... probably, I'd say, one of the most wildly popular toys in history. Lathan: With the Ideal toy deal, he literally went from "nothing to everything" overnight. He built a million dollar house on a golf course immediately and Robbie was a product of all that. Evel always said he saved the toy industry. It was on its ass and I think that's true. They claim 125 million dollars of which he got 60 million of, -- he says -- But it started with the stunt cycle and it progressed immediately to various dolls. It was the biggest selling toy in history. Bill: You know, not only are they makin' all these Evel Knievel toys, younger kids were watchin' Robbie. Robbie's comin' up and... So next thing you know they have 'Robbie' toys. Robbie: Everything changed when the toy deal came out. It just went huge to money. And then we moved into that house. I just started realizin', Holy Cow, we're gonna get a house in Fort Lauderdale, Florida on the intercoastal. We just built these eight acres on the golf course. I didn't understand where all this was comin' from. He had a red Ferrari, and he had a Boxster, he had a Maserati, he had a Lamborghini, he wanted two of everything. He had two Lear jets and I go "Why do you got two Lear jets?" And he says, "I wanted my name painted in gold leaf on one end of the wing so I could fly next to it and see my name on the other Lear jet." I just didn't get it. Kelly: That was my dad's money. My dad built himself a nice house and bought himself some nice cars and some airplanes and some yachts and we got to go on some nice vacations. But it was not our money. That was very clear. Bill: I believe the pressure of success, after Evel had accomplished gettin' the toy deal done, the pressure was unbelievable on 'im. He knew that he had to keep doin' what he was doin' to keep this show alive. Including the toys. The more success that Evel saw, well, the more he was drinkin'. Life turned into bein' a great big party. Y'know, you jump in them Lear jets and away you go. And you'd be in LA at the Beverly Hills hotel. Be there with Johnny Bench and a bunch of his buddies. The party's on! I lived it. I watched it. And it was like Jesus, he knew how to party. [♪ Blues-rock instrumental ] Lathan: I think the Snake River Canyon jump, it's the first time in his career he actually, potentially... thought he could perish. The whole family was on the edge of their seat and I think for Robbieto be at the impressionable age of 12, it had to be very, very hard on his psyche. But at the same time he was chasing the same dream of impossible feats. And to this day, Robbie still wants to sit in that rocket and jump that canyon. Robbie: Tryin' to take this all in at 12 years old is tough. It's like weird. I just thought, what, you just get inside of a bomb and just... explode or what? Y'know, it was like, jeez, dad might not be comin' home. I've never been afraid in my life of dying... Robbie: My mom, my dad's sisters, my grandparents, everybody's there standing by the truck. He takes a shot of Wild Turkey and the astronaut comes in the truck. I was sittin' in there with him and he says, "Evel, piece- a'cake, don't worry about it." My dad said "Thank-you." And boom, he's out the door and he's live on closed circuit television. Linda: I was so shocked to see my eldest son crying. I was numb to feelings, I guess. I remember saying, Kelly, you're cryin'." But I thought the way that he treated him through the years, that he must not like him any more than I did but... it kinda turned me around, y'know, to think, oh my gosh, you are ...really not feeling right. Kelly: Everybody tells me how nervous they all were and how nervous we all were and I guess I'm the only guy that doesn't remember it that way. I mean I'd seen my dad crash and he always did what he said he was gonna do and... I mean, I don't think Iever thought the guy was gonna die. Tracey: We all thought he was gonna die that day. He did. We did. How d'you say good-bye? You know it was just weird. Robbie: All of a sudden I hear "Ten!" Nine! Eight! Seven! Six! Five! Four! [roaring rocket sound] It sounded like a building comin' down. [Rocket engine] Announcer: I feel like I'm there. [chuckles] And, uh... I just thought "There goes dad." "He's gone." The chute's out, he's goin' in the river. But he blew back! Lucky bastard! [laughs] So, I's like... "Oh shit, I gotta listen t'him yell at me some more?" [Laughs] Naw, we were all glad to see he was alive. I mean he got us Lear jets, Ferraris and boats in Florida! We were having a blast. Tracey: It was really hard emotionally because, you really thought he was gonna die and there was this traumatic, y'know and dramatic take off. and... all of that. And there he comes again. And you have to adjust again to like... [sighs] Ok, here we go again. 'Cause you knew it was gonna start right over again and that he was gonna start planning... more crazy things. And I think we did. We lived a really dramatic childhood wondering... if our dad would live. [♪ Bluegrass instrumental ] Spanky: Bill Rundle is Robbie's crew chief. He handles the motorcycles. Bill's always there helping to take some off the weight on him when there's problems, or somethin' comin' up, Bill makes sure that it's done. Then on my end, I coordinate the show... with speeds and ramp angles. But, even though I do all that, it's still Robbie... makin' the jump. He's training as much as he can. and what surprises me, he hasn't been on a motorcycle in a long time, he can go get on it and do 70-mile-an-hour wheelies like he was never off it. I mean, the kid's amazing. Doug: Some guys don't make it past a year or two and Robbie Knievel is going into his fifth decade. I mean anything can happen. The big jumps can get ya, the short jumps can get ya. Doug Danger, a famous daredevil, he jumped 42 cars before and he almost got killed on an 11-car jump. Gary: I would teach Robbie to wheelie and to slide motorcycles and stuff and it was very apparent he was a gifted rider. So I spent a lotta time with him. I became his pseudo-father or bigger brother. [Motorcycle engine starting] Gary: When Robbie was young and started doing the tricks, and found out he could do them well, he was in thirst. He was in need... of the acknowledgement and he loved it when people complimented him on what he could do. He certainly was a reflection, if not the same person, that his father was as a child. They were both little renegades running around Butte, Montana. Evel certainly had a colourful past, and somewhat crooked and Robbie was on that path. He was destined to be the daredevil and I don't think he did it to please his father. Robbie did it... His whole daredevil career and trying to excel in all that was, was a needhehad and it's a common need for daredevils. It's somethin' we needed to feed. And potentially that's our egos. He and his dad didn't get along very well at all. And I think that's because they were the same person. Bill: Stayin' at home wasn't somethin' that he wanted to do. He wanted to get out. And there was a time... where we rode every day. And I mean we didn't just ride. We rode as hard as you could possibly ride. Y'know, we pushed it to the limit. [Motorcycle engine revving] Robbie: My dad, he knew I was a better rider. I rode every day you know? And I had better bikes And I could ride outta my backyard like he could. I rode so much more and was so more dedicated to my bike, fitting into it and being the best rider in the world and for some reason he just didn't wanna pass that baton to me. I don't know. He didn't want me to get hurt, for one and he knew I'd keep tryin' to jump further and every guy that was tryin' to jump against him was gettin' hurt or paralyzed. And he didn't want me to be in that business. He wanted me, to have fun with me and do some little jumps but he knew I'd stick with it and probably kill myself. Bill: The fights between Robbie, as he got older, got worse. The minute he was old enough to drive, Evel would get him cars and he'd wreck 'em. It seemed like it was a constant battle, all the time. And, y'know, Robbie... I remember him one time at the hospital and his nose was full of gauze because it was... Shattered so bad, Y'know? But he still loved his father. Robbie: I went and saw the movie at the drive-in with a friend a'mine. And I was s'posed to be home at 10. And it was called "The Longest Yard" with Burt Reynolds. It was a prison movie. So we had quite a few beers and I go, "I ain't goin' home!" So I ended up goin' home at about four in the mornin'... my dad was standin' there waitin' for me. So I got behind the table and said a few things to him and... Really ticked him off. And he got me on the ground, broke my nose. Kicking me in the face. The middle of my nose was up to my eye. And, y'know, he was, he was mad. I was scared to death of 'im. Bill: So my mom says "I'll take custody of Robbie." He was at our house. Next thing I know, there's two or three cop cars. There's a Ferrari out in front. Linda followed him over cause she knew he was gonna go nuts. And my mother didn't back down. She was callin' him every name you could imagine. But, you know, there was times that... Boy, he took some beatin's. [Kelly] I mean, y'know I suppose he was just testin' his boundaries like, like any other kid. Only, the stuff he used to do, like, he drove his motorcycle over the golf course greens for God's sake I thought my dad was gonna kill the little son of a bitch. He'd steal the car. Or he'd steal money from my dad. He was just an adolescent rebel. And he would challenge my dad. I don't know what he expected to happen. If he was gonna challenge my dad, he was gonna get knocked on his ass real quick. So I don't know what the kid was thinkin'! Linda: You know I used to think I was such a good mother to them and everything but Robbie was not in control. I never knew what to do with him. I think I spent my whole life sayin', "I don't know what to do!" It wasn't like you had all these radio programs and all this television stuff to help y'out nowadays! Y'know, or the backbone to do anything about it. Y'know? I just... It was like... Shock. Robbie: I got in some trouble. Robbed a music store. And, uh... Got probation 'cause I was underage. And then I robbed it again the next year. And got caught, again. And got 35 days 'cause I was underage. And the judge told me, "If you rob this place again I'm gonna put you away for 10 years for burglary... I don't care what age you are." And, uh... Anyway, I heard it got robbed again but they never caught the guy so I dunno what happened. I don't know why I was so wild. I did everything for my dad from cleanin' the horse stalls to feedin' the dogs in the freezin' cold and y'know paintin' the fences all the time and him yellin' at me at the same time goin' through all his pain. If you could understand what he was goin' through... You could understand why he was screamin' and yellin' a lot. He was handlin' all his own business. He was his own PR man, his own manager, his own... Entertainer. I mean and riskin' his life at the same time so... Me and my dad had our y'know... arguments. But of course he always won 'cause he'd kick the crap outta me. Gary: Robbie, at 15, had had enough and ran away from home. Now he's in Butte, Montana and I live in Southern California. There's a knock at my door and there's 15-year-old Robbie on my porch. He'd thumbed his way across the country and just shown up at my house. No warning, no anything! I don't know what he thought he was gonna do. I think he thought he was gonna move in with me and I was gonna raise him. But, I mean... Evel and I were associates at that time and... Starting in 1975... I was... Evel Knievel's double. Anything that had to do with films and commercials and stuff, I was the guy in the suit. So, I was given no choice but to throw him in the car and drive him back to Butte, Montana! [♪ ringing guitar ] Newscaster: Robbie Knievel had hoped to jump during this year's Evel Knievel Days and tonight we hear from him... Robbie Knievel says, above anything, he was looking forward to jumping for his fans who have waited a long time to see him back on two wheels. Robbie: I just found out my jump got cancelled for Evel Knievel Days because of my DUIs. Never cancelled a jump in 45 years of my career and uh, yeah I'm upset. Bill: It's very disappointing but it's not the end of the world. In fact it's probably a blessing. I know it's hard for Robbie to understand that right now. But in my shoes it's a different thing because I'd like to see him be a little sharper. Give us another month and let 'im ride some more. But it doesn't matter, he's sober, and he's the guy that I knew 25 years ago. It's been 38 years of doing this together but we haven't seen him like this for so long and just... I look forward to the future. Are we gonna be back? Absolutely. Matthew: It was too much, too soon. The ink wasn't even dry on the court papers and he wanted to get back on the motorcycle and jump and celebrate this newfound sobriety but unfortunately I think that... There was just too many legal issues. Robbie [V.O.]: Yesterday I went to court and... They gave me my freedom to leave the state and go jump where I want and keep workin' on my Snake River Canyon deal and this really sucks that I can't be here for Evel Knievel Days and jump but I'm ready to jump. I'm free to go, leave the state, and go to the Snake River and work on that and do whatever jumps I want around the country, or overseas, anywhere I wanna go. Anyway, dad, I'm gonna keep goin'. No problem. I'm gonna hit that take-off ramp just like you did. [♪ Dramatic film score ] Lathan: Jaws came out and the popularity of Jaws was enormous so somebody came up with the idea to put a buncha sharks in a tank in the Chicago amphitheatre. Bill: Evel was gonna jump a shark tank. He had a couple glasses of Wild Turkey. He brings the bike up there at the top And he had to come down the amphitheatre. Well, when he did, he... lost control, bike went off the side of the ramp... Hit a cameraman... ...tore his eye out. Lathan: Broke both of his arms on the crash and shortly after he got out of the hospital from the crash, that's when the Shelly Saltman incident occurred. Doug: Shelly Saltman wrote this book and Evel read it and did not like what he wrote and he was so mad at Shelly Saltman, he had some guy hold him down while Evel beat him with a baseball bat and actually broke the guy's arms with the baseball bat. And Evel said, "You'll never write anything about anybody again." Reporter: Mr. Knievel, why did you insist on pleading guilty today? Because, uh... Reporter: Ok, how's that? The charge is... Hitting a man with a baseball bat, intending to do bodily injury, and I did it. Doug: Evel took the full rap, told the judge, "I did it and I'll do it again." "I hate the guy." And Evel did his time in jail. But it ruined his career. I mean - everything went. The Harley-Davidson deal, the toy deal, everything, gone. Evel's mindset, I guess, was frontier justice in Butte, but this was Los Angeles where he did it and it didn't go over too good even in 1977. Matthew: As if it wasn't bad enough, when he came out, the IRS took everything he had left and that's when Evel really kinda withdrew from everything. You wanna talk about some dark times? Tracey: He called one day and he said, "Tracey, I don't want you to go home from school today, I want you to go to your grandparents." And I said, "How come?" And he said, "Because they're gonna lock our gates and auction off our house today." Kelly: Beatin' up Shelly Saltman was just an ego thing that my dad did that ruined his career. I don't know what possessed him to do it or what he thought was so awful that he felt compelled to do it. Hell, I don't know. It's just not a very good thing for our family. [♪ Solemn Piano ] Robbie: I didn't really ever read the whole book ever. I just went through it. And a lot of it was true. As I got older, I saw how things... How my dad was and how things happened. When my dad went to jail, uh... For six months, I took advantage of it and told my mom I was movin' out. And I just told her I was tired of all the hollerin' and screamin'. But I kept wantin' to be... better than him. I moved out and quit school and said I knew what I wanted to do when I was eleven years old for a living. And he wasn't around to, y'know... Smack me in the head and... [Chuckles] Or beat me with a stick, so I left! [♪ Blues instrumental ] Robbie: I walk outta my bus or my motorhome... For all these years and I just say a prayer that I hope I get back so I can hit that highway and be free again and keep makin' the living and livin' the modern gypsy life I live. You can't explain the jumps and the death part. But it's there. You can be dead in two seconds after you leave that take-off ramp. And you don't get to walk back into your motorhome, you don't get to see your cash, you don't get to fill your tank up, you don't get to go to the beach, you don't get to go to the mountains. That's why I picked this life. Because that's the life I have. Spanky: Well I think Robbie, drivin' off down the road, he's pretty content with that but I always thought he's kinda missin' something in his life And, uh... I don't really know what that is. But when you're out there riskin' your life, some people, girlfriends, even friends , they don't accept it and so it's kinda hard so you're kinda out there, kinda on your own. [♪ Moody Piano ] Rob: You talk about isolation. As an alcoholic, being up in our own minds is the worst possible place you can be. Because we start thinkin' about a lot of different things. The past. And as you isolate, and you stay awake, you're not interacting with people. You're not learning how to do those things sober. That's bad. We watch for it in rehab, we watch for all those types of things. We don't want people isolating. Is he white-knuckling like he was at the top of a ramp? At the top of the ramp, he's not white-knuckling it but is he white-knuckling his sobriety? That can only go on so long if he is. Robbie: When me and my dad split up, I was on my own. I was gone. And there's nothing he could say. And he was drinkin' more and more because his career was over. Anyways, I kept drinkin', I was young and I was on the road and I was tryin' to get a show wherever I could. Bill: 1980, that was the end of it for Evel. He decided to retire. It was a sad day. We had to take everything they owned outta the house. We used the semis and moved it over to my parents' house and we had garage sales. Just a matter of gettin' money together. Pretty much leavin'. He got a coach from a company called "Legends" His deal was to do these paintings. Travel around the country and sell the artwork. It was a rough road. Alicia: All the other documentaries, if I'm even mentioned, they say, "And then he had Alicia, and then he lost everything !" We had a great relationship, so it's... it's different than the other kids. I was the only one he was ever at the hospital with... When I was born. I think he realizedit was his do-over chance to be a... A normal father with me, at least. I know he loved the other kids and was there and they had their own. But that was the height of his career. He had tobeEvel Knievel then, and he had already done that when I came along. So we just travelled around in a bus a lot. Robbie: In 1981, I was 19 years old and... I wanted to beat all these guys so I moved to the desert, rode with them guys in hard dirt and that's when I really started tryin' to go bigger distances. Got in touch with an old manager that was friends of my dad's. And he was quite the promoter. He took me 'all-in.' Kenny: I worked with his father from 1969 until I was a pallbearer at his funeral. I didn't know how good a rider he was or anything And he was the best motorcycle rider that I had ever seen. He was much, much better than his father. And I was astonished. Nobody knew Robbie. They didn't know that Evel had a son. He wouldn't let Robbie get any of the publicity, wouldn't let'im jump far. Robbie: And he says, "I got a contract all ready." It was 50/50. I was like... "Why're you askin' me 50/50?" Y'know, I was 19 years old. Never signed a contract with any manager. And he says. "Well, Elvis did. With Colonel." And I says, "OK." So I signed it. Y'know, I was young, dumb and desperate. Kenny: It was starting from scratch. And I was gonna try to get him into acting using the Knievel name. And the fact that he could jump. The producer from CHiPS called me. He wanted Robbie to do a stunt. And I told him, "Robbie'll do the stunt... ...if he can do some acting in it." Or do you plan on risking your life forever? Don't worry about me. After my aeronautic super stunt next week, I'm gonna kick back in style. "Aeronautics?" Evel Knievel said it was totally impossible. He should know. He's the father of it all. Announcer: Any hesitation or miscalculation on Shake's part, Spanky: When Robbie comes along, I'm goin'... "This is Evel Knievel's son. Y'know, he's not gonna be as good as his dad. He's just a kid tryin' to capitalize on his dad's name." Then I went out there and I watched him ride a motorcycle And he was young. And I seen this kid ride. And I said "Man, this kid is no joke. He's the real deal." Bill: Robbie started practicin' and jumpin' a lot more. He started, uh... Probably partyin' a lot more because he was on his own. Certainly the equipment was different. But Robbie had a talent. Not only... could he jump the bike but he could ride the hell out of it. Spanky: He trained. Every day he was out there jumpin' motorcycles. Thousands of jumps. Kenny Brown helped him get a few shows and Robbie pulled it off. Gary: He wanted to break out of his dad's shadow and start makin' a name for himself as a long distance jumper which he did. He certainly blitzed all the numbers that Evel had ever set. He flew past all those. Then he started, the majority of the jump, he'd try and take his hands off in the air. Spanky: First guy to ever even try this. People had never seen that before. They seen his dad doin' all these jumps and crashin' and stuff. He takes his hands off the handlebarandlandsit! Bill: He comes off the ramp and lets go of the bike and I'm like Holy shit! Y'know, 'cause I'd never seen it before. I mean, X-Games and that stuff comes thirty years later! Doug: I remember when I saw the ad. I go, "What!?" And then they said he's gonna jump with no hands. Like are you kiddin' me? I couldn't believe it. I'm going whoa! Yeah, and I was pretty much hooked on Robbie Knievel after that. Spanky: As a young kid... It took him to a bigger level. It was pushin' the envelope. It's what he had to do, to show 'em he just wasn't "Evel Knievel's son." He was Robbie Knievel, his own person. Bill: I'll never forget after he did the first show where he let go of the handlebars, he come in and he, hands me his helmet and he goes - "Look dad, no hands!" [Laughs] I started laughin' my ass off. And he said boy, 'He'd love that, wouldn't he?" Announcer: This is KRIV-TV Metromedia, Houston. Yeah, I'm doin' no-handed jumps. A lot of people say we're a lot alike. I'm my own man and... And I love it. And I wanna go, keep the name "Knievel" the most famous on one or two wheels. Lathan: When Evel retired, it opened the door for a lot of new performers. There was lighter motorcycles, better suspension, just a little more opportunity and I think once he kind of, y'know, laid his bike down... And Robbie took off and did his thing, it just... It just wasn't the same. It was a different era. Y'know Evel came along when the country was down and they needed a superhero But the competition progressed I think year-by-year since probably 1979, 1980. Gary Wells was sort of on the cusp of the late 70's, early 80's. Doug Danger was a primary competitor. Eddie Kidd. They just nipped at his heels all the time. So he was havin' to push himself further and further and further. Reporter: What about Knievel though? Is he next in line for you? Reporter: Robbie, do you know you're gonna be challenged? No, I'm not being challenged. He's gonna come out here and make a jump after I am. I'm makin' a jump, if he's gonna try and jump further, that's uh... Reporter: Say something, if you'd like, to Mr. Knievel. Tell him what you'd like him to hear. No, Robbie, c'mon, let's do this thing. It's been enough time talkin' and enough time playin' around. Let's get out here one on one. I'm calling you out and if you're man enough, you'll be there. Doug: Well in the early 80s, when Robbie Knievel started jumpin' on his own. without his dad around, this is where I think he got lost. He had to go out and try to jump farther than all these other jumpers. I think it's his ego that made him have to do that. He's Robbie Knievel. He can show up and draw people and just put on a nice show. He didn't have to jump farther than I did. He didn't have to jump farther than Gary Wells. But... He got lost the same way I did. With jumping... We're motorcycle riders. We wanna beat everybody that rides a motorcycle. Gary: There was a little group of 'em that all jumped similar distances and so there was competition so yes Robbie lived under the same pressure of trying to live up to his dad's name. At the same time, he had to make sure that he beat all of them in distance so he could always claim that there was a Knievel at the front of this line. They were all competing against Evel Knievel. Because no matter how far anyof them jumped... The world was never really gonna care. Evel: I don't think that jumpin' 22 or 23 cars... Is gonna make any difference as if you came out here and jumped 14 or 15 with no hands. And now, speaking as a parent, Robbie: I picked up and started doin' these real long jumps "old school." He, in a way, I think became jealous of me because I was really ticked off and goin' after these young kids to say, "Hey, I'm better than you." That's why I kept spreadin' the distances. I felt like he treated me like another jumper that was tryin' to take it away from him. When I was his biggest fan. Do you plan on going after your father's records? Is that one of your goals? To maybe outdo the old man? Well, he said I was a better rider than him when I was 12. I did 13 buses in the L.A. Coliseum about year ago, no-handed, a jump he missed in London and got hurt real bad. It's hard enough to be in this business And unless these promoters are gonna start paying me some more money, I'm not gonna be jumpin' any farther. I'm jumpin' as far as I can. Kenny: He wasn't as good at speaking as his father was. His father was pretty good at keeping a crowd. And Robbie basically would get up there, and say a few words, and then jump. Robbie: He was tryin' to suck me in and keep me for the rest of my life, at 50/50. So we got in a big fight and I says, "I'm gonna file bankruptcy and get outta your contract." And he says, "You can't do that." And I said, " Yeah, I can." And I did and it was in the paper the next day. Knievel's manager sues him, Robbie files bankruptcy and he's outta the contract. So me and him split up. He threatened me a few times. He sent some guys over from New York, told 'em to leave the house or I was gonna call the cops, and if they came in, I'd shoot 'em. So I was on my own again. Kenny: He had a mind of his own and how he wanted to do things and when he came up to Arizona, he had a drinking problem. His drinking problems and other problems that he had, uh...grew because of the... I think the people that were around him. Y'know, when you are becoming a star, you get an awful lot of hanger-onners. Robbie: I went on tour with the truck-pulls so I was tourin'. It was only seven states. I never jumped and went on this tour in three years. After all the jumps I'd already done since I was young. I'm goin' from BC Place, we gotta be in Miami Orange Bowl in three days and I'm doin' two days of PR before the jump, and we had to drive to San Diego in three days, then we had to drive clear back to Sullivan Stadium because they were puttin' me in all their big venues to headline their truck pulls. Doug: It just was a natural progression to go to the same venues that his dad went to, and 'up' the dad. Dad jumped at the Cow Palace, Robbie jumped at the Cow Palace. Dad jumped at King's Island, Robbie jumped at King's Island. And then you're gonna pack 'em in when it's the legend continuing with the son doin' it. Kelly: When my dad built his career, I mean my dad made... 175 jumps. My dad drove his truck to county fairs and dragstrips all over this United States. I mean Robbie did the same thing. People forget how many times Robbie's jumped. Robbie's jumped hundredsof times. Robbie has driven his truck and set up his ramps all over the United States. I mean nobody hands you fame and fortune. You know, you gotta go earn it. Robbie: The 80s, everybody was partyin'. All my friends, they were all older than me. And I was travellin' and they were goin' on the road with us. They were into stuff heavier and I was just jumpin' and havin' fun. And there was a lot of dark nights, a lot of lousy mornings that were just ugly. But I lived that life. A lot of people do. 70s and 80s was crazy. Partyin'. 'Cause I could drink. And then it was, got more and more and more and more. Reporter: So Robbie, you always jump with your dad? Robbie: No. You don't always have it set up so your dad's the guy runnin' it, huh? Robbie: No I'm with United Sports. I'm with a whole different company. I don't even deal with my dad. Reporter: So you don't travel with him at all or anything? ... to go on my own. Robbie: There was a couple... times when I went to jump when I was pretty busy. And my father came to a couple of my jumps in the 80s. A couple of 'em. He just happened to be in San Jose. One night, I was up partyin' all night. I was more worried that my father knew I was partyin'. I was more worried about him knowin' that I was too out-of-it to jump. Gary: I would often get phone calls from one and have to call the other and then explain somethin' and then they would tell me somethin' and I would have to call the other one back. So I was constantly stuck in the middle whenever these guys were arguing. It was nice when Robbie would make a jump and Evel would appear in support of him. But most of the time, Evel didn't, and when he did, he got all the attention because he was Evel Knievel. And that took away from Robbie. So Robbie didn't like that at all. Remember, we're still feedin'hisego too. So, there just wasn't enough accolades goin' on in any one event to feed both those egos. Robbie: How do I like it having my dad runnin' around doin' the show with me? I think he's real proud to be around me and I'm glad to do somethin' with him. We can't work together all the time because some fathers and sons, when it comes to business, they should just keep it a father and son relationship. But we get along good. He's gettin' a little older. I can handle him a little easier. Interviewer: He's gettin' more easy on ya, huh? It's nice to have him around. I'm glad he's still alive. Kelly: In the 80s, it was all about Robbie. It's got nothing to do with keeping the Knievel legend alive I mean Robbie was actually capitalizing on the Knievel legend. But he was doing the same thing as my dad. I'm not tryin' to take anything away from the guy. He was out there makin' a livin' bein' a daredevil. It's just the way it goes. It's not Robbie keepin' the legend alive. There was a legend - now there's Robbie - Robbie's out earning a living. I mean it goes together. Robbie: I'm going to continue on for the next 5 or 10 years. Hopefully and set a new distance record. In about 1990, '91, to show everyone my dad wanted to land on a nice soft spot instead of down in the rocks. [Cheering] Gary: Through the early and mid-80s, he was trying to make a huge name for himself and potentially replace his father. He thought that he could eclipse that name. In the latter 80s, I think he came to resign himself to the fact that that was never gonna happen. His dad was too big a name. And he changed his whole marketing to: "The Legend Continues." Therefore, extending the Knievel name into that field and just carrying his dad's legacy and I think that probably made him sleep better at night. Robbie: I wasn't national TV. I was just out jumpin' for a living around here and there. It wasn't huge exposure. It was just in each city. But I was payin' my dues and keepin' the name goin' and then so Caesar's, that's why it was so big to me, 'cause it was live television. [♪ Pounding funk-rock ] Doug: Caesar's Palace is where motorcycle jumpin' really began. The art of daredevilry. It was all caught in slow motion and when they see Caesar's Palace and they see that horrible crash that Evel had, and then to top it off, Gary Wells goes back, and his crash was just as bad if not worse. Right into that wall at 80 miles an hour. Announcer: He's down! He's hurt! Doug: This is the one hat's gonna be conquered. Gary: All the jumpers of that era wanted to make that jump and make it successfully Thinkin' that was gonna launch us into stardom. Spanky: Every motorcycle jumper, everybody was so intrigued about that they wanted to do it, but the door wasn't open very well 'cause they weren't lettin' anybody do it. Bill: Our life's dream was to go to Caesar's Palace. I remember Robbie sayin', "Hey, we're gettin' close, man. We're gettin' close." "We're gonna get this done." That was something that had ate at Robbie for a long time. It was his turn. Robbie: I tried talkin'em into it for years. And they wouldn't let me. And then Dick Clark called me and my dad one day and he says,"What does Robbie wanna do?" He wants to jump the Snake River Canyon. I go no, I do, but first I wanna jump Caesar's. Because nobody's made it. My dad says, "Oh, anybody can make Caesar's Palace!" And I wanted to say, "Well, why didn't you?" And why didn't Gary Wells? I mean Gary was a good rider but he was a bigmouth and he was always jealous of me and my dad. And he says, "Evel, Caesars sounds great. We're gonna give Robbie a shot at it." Gary: This was a chance for Robbie to not only put the Knievel name back up front but to launch his career as the man who conquered Caesar's Palace, the one that seemed to be unconquerable at that time. Doug: It's just set up perfectly for the public. I mean, third try is the charm and now you have the heir to the guy who invented the Caesar's Palace jump, the guy that thought of it, Evel Knievel's son is gonna try it. And so it was a huge deal. [Motorcycle engine starting] Spanky: Me and Robbie get together and he'd train, he'd practice. And he realized that he could make this jump. Jumpin' at Caesar's palace, you're blind. You got fountains there and all that and you get over that, then you prepare for landing. But from one side of the fountains to the other side you can't see the other ramp. Robbie: I've been on my own for a long time. I'm glad my dad's still alive. I'm not really glad he's alive to take half my money! [Laughs] But I owe him this one. I'm gonna show 'em. I always wanted to go back and do all the jumps that he missed with no hands. Robbie: I just put all my focus on Caesar's. Hired my crew, everybody I knew. Go do practice jumps a little more than half the distance out at a rough drag strip in the daytime when it was hot. And I was just really stressed because this was the biggest jump I ever tried. Thirty feet further than my dad. I was nervous as hell. And here's my first live show. On television, jumpin' Caesar's fountains, and nobody ever made it. Bill: It was the roughest two weeks of my life. Because you have Evel over here and you have Robbie over here and the whole time, they're just buttin' heads. Evel's calling me sayin', "Where's that little son of a bitch at?" And "I'm gonna kill'im." And then Robbie callin', "I'm gonna punch him when I see him." You know, then I'd take 'em to go do Good Morning America And both, "Oh hi Robbie, hi dad." And they give each other a hug. And I'm like, man, you bastards are killin' me. Emcee: The dynamics of Evel and his son Robbie. Robbie will attempt that jump It's been attempted by others. We hope that Robbie obviously achieves that but we also think that it's a very dynamic event when you think of father and son. Robbie: I had left home in the early 80s and by the time '89 rolled around, we're back together doing this big press tour and my dad was just... my dad. He was behind me, but he never really wanted to move over and pass that baton, so, I was always nervous about what I was gonna say next to 'em. I couldn't really be myself. I'll know that... To know success or failure. Evel: We haven't chosen the motorcycle we're gonna use yet for that jump. [Laughter] Emcee: Any other questions? Thanks for comin'! Robbie: I came in one day in front of all the cameramen from USA Today to Entertainment Tonight. He starts yellin' at me. In front of all these cameramen at Caesar's Palace. In front of the fountains. I said, "I'm goin' to practice... Go F yourself." "Leave me alone. I have a jump to do." "You didn't make it. I gotta make it." "Help. Leave me alone. Give me some support." Gary: When Evel finally hooked back up with Robbie, they seemed to be on good terms. I don't know how much of that was genuine. Whether they were playing to the press. Robbie certainly wanted his dad's support and love through the whole thing. But he didn't necessarily want his dad showin' up at all the jumps and robbin' him of his limelight. Doug: These guys know what they're doin'. You know, It's all a show but it's all a big show of egos, too. You know, motorcycle jumpin' y'know, its a... ego sport. Everybody wants to be the best. It's a cocky, macho thing. The only kind of guys that do it are cocky, macho guys. You don't see the timid guy jumpin' bikes, that's for sure. Robbie: Back in '89, for my Caesar's Palace Jump, this is where I'd love to train. This was a total escape from all that. To get out here and ride and just to be alone sometimes. Comin' up to the biggest jump of my life, to have a place like this to... go hang out, hide out, just be by myself... Stare across the deserted land, and look at Vegas and know this is the biggest thing I've ever done, is really important. People don't know what it's like for me. They're like, "How do you psych yourself?" I just wanna be left alone out in the middle of nowhere and riding my bike, trainin'. Announcer: This man is a legend. This man is a superstar. [Announcer] It is my pleasure to introduce the first Caesar's Palace champion. The one and only - Evel Knievel. Bill: When we were sittin' in the dressing room, there was just the two of us. We wanted everybody out and so... Robbie and I were just sittin' there waitin' for'em to knock on the door and your adrenaline is flowin'. And I'm watchin' it on TV, the people out there, and I'm like Holy shit, now this is for real. Sure enough, the knock on the door, and we looked at each other... Gave each other a hug. I started cryin'. He had tears in his eyes. So I wiped the tears out. I said, "Let's go buddy." Let's get this thing over with. Bob: Before Robbie did my show, he had called me and asked me if I wanted to come to the jump. I said, "Of course!" So I went back and met him and it was great. I was impressed because what he was doing was really kind of strange. It was not easy. It really wasn't. My son. My son. I am not the greatest daredevil in the world. And I would like to introduce you to my son... Bob: We leave the changing room. And we're walking and it starts off with about 5 people. And it's growing as we're walking. And it's not a little walk. It's alongwalk! We're goin' through the casino, we're goin' through Vegas, and all of a sudden there's cops joining us! And I say, "Boy, this must be more important than I thought." Robbie: You know, they're delayin' everything and I'm usually walkin' out for the jump, "Let's go," y'know? When it was time, they kept stoppin' me in the hallway. Stop. Wait. Stop. Wait. And I'm like, " What is goin' on?" Bob: And I said to the cops, "Why are there so many police?" And he said, "Because another daredevil has threatened toshootRobbie." Gary Wells was the guy's name, that's right. Who knows?... in the daredevil world? Crazy world, you know what I mean? You gotta be insane to do this. I shook Robbie's hand and said,"I'm through walking... I'll see ya after you make the jump." Good luck and I hope you don't get shot." And that was it. Then I left. Cause I didn't wanna die over this. I wasexcitedabout it but I didn't want a bullet in the face. [crowd applauding] Kelly: I could tell that my dad was like really proud of Robbie and he was really proud of the accomplishment and that was nice. Y'know? Nice to... see when your dad's proud of you. My dad just exuded that that day. He probably thought that it had all to do with him but. [Laughs] [Motorcycle engine] TV Announcer: We'll let some of the Bill: I kept lookin' down at that bike and, and... It was like I was talkin' to it. "Just going, come on, baby, just fly tonight please." 'Cause, you know, you've seen the crashes. "We knew what you're up against." [Motorcycle engine] Robbie: When I made the first run, I realized the pavement's way colder than the drag strip I was practicin' on during the day. And when I jumped at night at Caesar's, it was smoother cement, my motor was runnin' cooler, and I just wasn't hookin' up. Bill: My heart was beatin' outta my chest. You're lookin' at the crowd and you're lookin' at this runway and it's really narrow and all you can see is the take-off ramp. TV Announcer: Bill, did you think that was gonna be it? And is there any problem? Bill: No, he's gonna come this shot I think. TV Announcer: This is it? Bill: This is it. TV Announcer: Bill Rundle says this is it and he's on his way. Robbie: I'd spin and get into fourth gear and I had to hit fifth and I didn't think I'd ever get there. I usually go by the third or the fourth or I feel like I'm screwin' with my head and I'm gonna screw up. [Motorcycle engine] Robbie: I made four runs and I stopped again. And Bill and all my buddies are like, "Uh-oh what's wrong with him?" "It doesn't look like he's gettin' speed." TV Announcer: Bill: Bill: Boy, when it came time, I was lookin' into his eyes. They were that big around. I'll never forget it. I just kept telling him, just be focussed. And make your shifts, buddy. Robbie: I was nervous as hell. And I was stuck right in a corner. Here, this is what I wanted. Now here I go. So it's like, "Don't hesitate. You'll lose." [Motorcycle Engine] [Solemn Piano] [Crowd cheering] TV Announcer: He's done it! He's done it! Robbie Knievel has done it! And they're going crazy! Robbie: I made it. Missed the pillars. Wheelied back all the way through the garage with one hand And my mom and dad, and Super Dave, everybody came up. [Crowd cheering] [TV Announcer] Robbie Knievel, the first person to successfully jump the fountains at Caesar's Palace! Avenging his father, the legendary Evel Knievel. Bob: It was magnificent. Everything about it was perfect. He certainly showed his father how it should be done. Bill: Evel was really excited that night. And I think right then was when, "I got this, dad." Y'know? The legend continued. Doug: When Evel was done jumpin'... Jumpin' was done, basically. There was a handful of guys who were tryin' to do what Evel was doin'. The only way that any of us could make any good money was if somebody kept it up on the front page of the newspaper. Kept everything big. And Robbie Knievel put motorcycle jumping back up on the front pages again. It was making Robbie a household name. Three things: shift, speed, focus. Doug Klang: After Caesar's Palace, with the success of that with pay-per-view, you know, it was all over. It was in a lot of magazines, it was on TV. It was on ESPN. It definitely broke him out. TV Host: Evel Knievel knows crashes but one daredevil has broken every record that Evel ever held. His son, Robbie! Doug Danger: Right after that, I saw Evel Knievel on a commercial. He's in a suitcase, fallin' out of an airplane. The thing smashes on the ground and opens up and he pops out and goes, "What I won't do to save a buck." Evel Knievel, his career took off again. Well, I think they fed off each other. They also fought a lot, too but I know they fed off each other, definitely. They know what to do. They're showmen. Announcer: February thrills on Fox! Rob: When I started with Fox, they were just beginning the news division. They were probably the experimental people in programming. And they discovered Robbie Knievel, the son of Evel Knievel. What could this do? And as Fox who does it, they throw shit all in together and see what happens. And Fox realized quickly that Robbie was a ratings draw. [♪ Pounding Rock ]s Doug: He was on a roll, Robbie, with the big jumps there. The "Fox Era", I call it... when he was live on Fox and they were gettin' the booming ratings. It started with the 30-limousine jump, which at the time was the farthest jump he'd ever tried. Rob: This was, you know, before you're hitting a whole bunch of reality shows and this had the look of 'big time.' You're sitting off the strip in Las Vegas. You've got media from all over the country. You're building up toRobbie Knievel jumping the limos. The son of Evel Knievel, in the shadows now. As Robbie gets ready to jump live on TV... We're all lined up there doing our live shots, Robbie's going up and down. He's getting his speed runs. You got Spanky out there and Bill Rundle The ramps are all set and then you know it's time. [Motorcycle engine roaring] [♪ Wailing electric guitar ] Kelly: Holy. Shit! I've never seen anything like that. Robbie's made some jumps that are like --fuck! Joe Buck: And the world record! Rob: Crowd loves it, you're in the centre of Las Vegas, and Fox picked up on it quickly. Ratings were huge. You had a guy putting his life on the line to dazzle an audience. Robbie Knievel, the legend continues. And then it was what could we do next? TV Announcer: The single most dangerous act ever attempted on live television! Captain Robbie Knievel's building-to-building death jump - live! Doug: The building-to-building jump was just terrifying. I actually cried and so did my wife. It was scary. Robbie has told me himself, too... that that was the scariest jump he's ever done. It was crazy. Fred Bezark, Robbie's manager and lawyer for a while, when I first met Robbie, and we were sittin' there at the bar, Fred, uh, leaned over to me that night and he said, "Hey, Robbie likes you, you guys are getting along." "Do you wanna move his drink to the side a little bit?" "Y'know, later, y'know?" Not more than 5 minutes later, Robbie turns to me, and he said, "By the way, at one point in time, somebody's gonna ask you to move my drink over a little bit out of my way." He goes, "I'd advise you against that." I said, "Lookit, I'm not gonna do that to you, man." "You do what you want." I said, "Why don't you just go to bed?" "You've gotta jump rooftop to rooftop tomorrow." And he looked at me, as cool as could be, and he said, "All it takes isrev it up, throttle it, and go." [Motorcycle engine roaring] [ó_ Wailing electric guitar ó] TV Announcer: Robbie Knievel successfully He's made it! Doug: Fox was on primetime TV. America was tunin' in and Fox got a piece of that and so did Robbie. Kids nowadays, you know, it's Travis Pastrana and all the X-Games stuff, but back there in the 90s, Robbie was huge then. Rob: I mean success comes change. Besides Fox, he is getting everybody's attention. What does that bring? It brings hanger-ons, it brings people that don't have the best intentions. But now there's some arguing because other people are jockeying to get into that posse. They're all comin' in because it's fame. This guy's riskin' his life. It's sexy. Bill: And he's rubbin' shoulders with celebrities, and we're goin' to celebrities' houses, and we're ridin' motorcycles with celebrities, we're doin' television shows with celebrities and, on the other end of it, everybody wanted to get close to Robbie Knievel. When the jump was over, the party was on. Rob: When they finished the rooftops in Vegas, I remember interviewing Robbie and all they could talk about was they were gonna scout the Grand Canyon. ...one man and one motorcycle stand face to face with the single most dangerous act. Captain Robbie Knievel's Grand Canyon Death Jump. Rob: The 3,000 foot drop at the canyon messed with his mind. He was up on those take off ramps. He, the one time I brought my ex-wife out there, he had a six-shooter on and he had gone through, y'know half a bottle of Patron. It had messed with him, mentally. It, it was a bizarre thing for all of us. [Motorcycle engine revving] TV Announcer: When he lands... Here's the run! Knievel attempting... [Motorcycle accelerating] He's hit the gap! He makes it! Kelly: I bawled my fuckin' eyes out. Layin' in the desert, and God, don't know if he's [laughing] dead or alive. All these. all these paramedics all around they're... trying to pull his helmet off. I hear, "God damn it, he might have a broken neck! Leave him alone!" 'Cause he got the wind knocked out of him so bad. Like he couldn't breathe. All of a sudden he catches his breath, he looks around and he goes, "Son of a bitch!" And we all go... God, he's alive! He made it! [Laughing] He's OK. He may have broken his leg but... It was a hell of a ride! Gary: Blew both of his ankles out. And had a bit of a concussion. He started askin' stupid questions and stuff again like all of us do when we hit our heads good. Rob: Robbie's gonna get up with Gary, with Bill, and he's gonna walk his way up to the ramp area, take the microphone from Fox, and he's gonna thank everybody out there because that's what Robbie does. And that's what you do as a Knievel. You get yourself back up by the bootstraps and that's that. Robbie didn't only just become a vehicle for Fox. He became the engine that could. He still brought in those ratings for them. Spanky: Robbie's never been that glamour guy. Glitter and all that, he never really cared for all that. But I thinkthat he started drinking a little bit more because I think you get these pressures. Every time everybody wants a world record, if anybody wants farther... You can only do so much. But everybody that books you in a show wants you to break some type of world record. And Robbie is out there tryin' to do it. Whatever they wanted, he'd try to do it for 'em. But by doing that it put a lot pressure on him. Because you can only do so much. TV Announcer: It's the... Announcer: Or he'll jump too early. He can't jump any later otherwise he will hit the train. Here he goes! Knievel is on his way. Here comes the train! [Motorcycle accelerating] [Explosion] He's off! Robbie Knievel has done it! Rob: The train jump was gonna be the swansong for Fox. We'd all heard about it but we weren't sure. And then we found out David Hill, who's in charge of programming for Fox, said, "I'll be damned if I'm gonna be the one to kill Robbie Knievel live on TV." What, he decides this four... jumps later? No, they had other programming. They were seeing a shift. How long can they play this game? American Idol comes up. All the other shows start coming up that Robbie maybe gave birth to. But Robbie's part, they had done enough. Fox saw that his time was up. They'd used him enough. So Robbie Knievel... sorta goes away. Kelly: And Robbie was just about to sign a contract to do another big series that... really woulda catapulted'im... and then Fox just cancelled! I mean that was a lost opportunity that Robbie really... It was just bad luck. Rob: It's so freakin' brutal how society can be especially in this business. You dangle all this. The fame, the fortune, the camera, the lights. And then it goes away. He did what he knew. He drank the pain. Didn't trust anybody, isolated... And harboured a resentment that kept him drinking and drinking and drinking that created the problems that he would run into later in life. Bill: He'd start yellin' and screamin' at people, well then, all of a sudden... They have no more use for you. And that's what happened. I mean... Robbie just started to slide and slide and slide. We kinda knew that it was comin' to the end. I remember drivin' home, and thinkin' about it the whole time, goin', man... This is gettin' so far outta hand now that... I don't know if we'll ever be able to help him. Rob: Well, you know, in between these times after Fox and he's goin' around doin' this stuff is... he's drinking a lot. And now when he's going for his warmups he'd be spillin' the bike. Y'know, he's drinkin' in his trailer. Now this is spreading; This is creating problems for Robbie. Knievel's Wild Ride didn't help that, the internet's not helping this because he's drunk, he's spilling the bike. People know it or people are assuming it. Robbie: I could drink 12, 14 doubles. I would say things... That I regretted. A lotta times I didn't remember. I would hurt people I know and I regret. When you drink, you say stupid things, you do stupid things. And all in a nutshell, I'm just tired of drinkin'. It's just done nothin' but... Push me backwards. It got me through my life but I think everybody changes at the time they are ready or it's God's plan. One or the other. And I was just ready... to quit this time. Alicia: Do I think Robbie ever found closure with my dad? No. No, I think it still eats at him, whatever it is that eats at him. From a Knievel standpoint, was it an impossible relationship? Um, if it was a normal father and son, they probably could have worked it out but they were both too headstrong and stubborn. [Footsteps] Spanky: Well I think Robbie always wanted his dad to be behind him 100%. That really never happened. But I think if Evel was alive today, and with Robbie bein' without alcohol... And done a good job stayin' sober for this long, I think Evel would be real proud of 'im. I think he'd be more proud of him for doin' that than his jumping Caesar's Palace. Bill: A lotta years went by... Without Evel and Robbie speaking. We'd always talk about his father, Robbie and I. Y'know, "Have ya talked to my old man?" I was there... About 10 days before Evel died. I went to Florida and spent 10 days with him. Then Kelly came shortly after I did. And spent some time with him And Robbie was on his way, in his coach to go spend his time with his father when his father died. Y'know, never got to say the things that he probably wanted to say. Don't think for a minute he doesn't think about it all the time. He didn't get a chance to say g'bye. Robbie: When he passed, I cried a lot for a lotta days. Lotta memories. If I don't remember anything, I kinda just go back to the map of all the places I've been and it comes right back. [snaps fingers] There was just a ton of memories. And memories that you can't explain to anybody else that didn't didn't grow up with him like I did. So I just had, uh... One hell of a father. When I think about it. Unbelievable. Just standing here. Comin' up this road so many times. And to have that thing count down in front of me. 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 Boom. Like a building comin' down ...and your dad's in it. That's what it was like. And losin' him, man... We all gotta die. And life's short. [♪ Strummed acoustic guitar ] Male voice: ♪ I have seen the light it's comin'♪ ♪ Shine down on me♪ Robbie: The Snake River, it's gonna wait until I'm ready. Until then, I'm gonna go to Palm Springs and do another big jump. Big jump, for my age and, uh... Just keep the name goin'. I'll be back to do the Snake River I hope one day. ♪ All my sins they punish me like soldiers in my soul♪ ♪ I forgive you, please forgive me♪ ♪ I swear I... didn't know♪ ♪ And I've been a selfish man♪ ♪ Lettin' go♪ Bill: This week is a new beginning and it's crazy to see Robbie out there with us. and y'know, before, you wouldn't, very seldom see him y'know, unless I would go see him. But now he's out here tellin' you how to jack the bike and what to do and it's like get back in your coach and have a diet Coke, will ya! It's brought the spirit back alive in me... So... It's a new beginning. And hopefully we can go for the next several years and... Make him some money and... Live happily ever after. Spanky: Well I think Robbie tryin' to jump again... after he's in this darkness for a long time, so now I think he wants to come back not to prove to everybody but to prove to himself and to see all the things that he missed when he was... You know, pretty well lit up. He was great at what he was doin' even when he drank quite a bit but, I think, now he's gonna look at his whole job a different way. Rob: Alcoholics, y'know are some of the most resilient people. There he is, 53 years old, nobody's gonna tell him he can't jump again. He's gonna do it, true Knievel style. And the legacy goes on and, y'know, now it's in Robbie's hands. His sobriety. His life. We can't do anything more for him. He's gotta do it. Doug: Has the jumping world passed Robbie by? Well yeah, these extreme athletes have passed everybody by! I mean Robbie is an old school daredevil. Y'know, he runs the old school show. These kids nowadays, they're at a whole different level. But... It's a dying thing that he's doing. And, you know, anybody that sees it is lucky to see it. [♪ Solemn piano ] Robbie: They're all big. They're all big. When you look at the other ramp and know you could just... lose your power. A sparkplug failure, a chain break when you're in your full momentum and you're already committed before you even take off in your mind. I worry about the bike cuttin' out. Because you're already committed to going off that stripe in the middle of the ramp. So if you land short, you're pretty much done. Every guy I know snapped his neck. Snapped neck: dead. [Cheering] Joe: If he continues to jump, it can't be good. 53, y'know... you'd be a crash away from bein' in a wheelchair like a lot of 'em have. I kinda hope he... Doesn't jump anymore. I don't want him to get hurt. Too old to be... launchin' on the motorcycle. Robyn: My brother did the same thing. Don't do the the big jumps, don't do the record jumps. The time has come that you need to take care of yourself and you never did do that. And I think Robbie's got that in him that he just has to go one step further to keep interest. And you know what? I don't know about that. Tracey: Sometimes I used to wonder if he was trying to conquer at least everything that our dad did and more. But now I don't know that he's trying to do that. I think he's just... Completing who he is. And especially now sober and knowing that he can do it. So I don't know how long he'll be able to keep jumping and performing. Kelly: I like goin' to watch Robbie jump but for some reason, it's like I'm thinkin' to myself, son of a bitch, he's53years old. No. I don't wanna go this time. If he crashes, I don't wanna see it. [Motorcycle engine revving] [♪ Solemn piano ] [Engine revving] [Muffled screaming] Robbie: Oh, my back hit hard! Bill: Get back everybody, please! Bill: You're not gonna let us? You want me to pull this up off your eyes? Linda: As far as Robbie chasin' Evel, I feel now... That Robbie hasn't chased Robbie enough. He's done all this stuff, risked his life... various, so many times, y'know? But I feel like Robbie needs to be known for Robbie. I think he needs that assurance, that reward, that he has done all these things himself and he hasn't really gotten it. Robbie: Meet me back at the ramp, buddy. [Laughter] Robbie: I'm walkin', buddy! Bill: Let's go. Oh, my back's killin' me. Hold on, let me rest a sec. It hurts, man. I felt that as soon as I hit. Doug: We're all chasing Evel. I'd like to go break all sorts of records that Evel had missed on. But, to me, he's cleaned up, he's sobered up. He's become a role model. Become somebody that they can look up to. And say hey, whatever, I found God, Whatever it takes. [Cheering] Doug: You've got the Knievel name. Every door in the world will open for ya. Use it for what it should be used for. Positive things in life. Lathan: Not only is Robbie gonna be chasing Evel, but any daredevil in history is gonna be chasin'im. I really think he's always gonna be in the shadow of his father. And he's always gonna be fighting to get out of that shadow which is admirable. Because it's not an easy thing to do. He's given it his best for many, many years. He's fallen down and gotten back up as well. So there's somethin' to be said for that. Spanky: Followin' in his dad's footsteps. He had a hard time trying to get away from that. But now, Robbie's his own person now. He's Evel Knievel's son but Robbie is also Robbie Knievel. Gary: There's a point in every daredevil's life... When you have to say, enough's enough, I've done all I can do. And still feel good about it. And some time, in possibly the very near future, Robbie's gonna have to face that fact, and address it. Bill: The legacy continues and thank God he didn't have a little boy so we'd have to go on and keep going because I mean it just... I know I don't have another 20 years left in me And, uh... But it's been one hell of a ride. Robbie: How do I wanna be remembered? From what I started from the beginning, kept my word like my dad taught me for what I was gonna do as far as risk my life. Be remembered as bein' honest. That I got from my mother and father. Just be remembered as I had a smile more than I didn't. And every time a little kid walked up to me, I shook his hand or signed his autograph. Be remembered that I believed I was goin' to heaven. Because that was eternal life. That I always believed and kept my faith. That's how I wanna be remembered. [♪ Slow rock ]
