THE CRY OF THE OWL Are you coming or what? I'm right behind you. I hate to ask, but can you do me a favor? What is it? A small loan till the end of the month. I gotta take Josette out for our wedding anniversary. Real cool of you! Why not come celebrate with us? - Josette would love it. - I'm not so sure. Come on, she's nuts about you! Three's a crowd for a wedding anniversary. Have a great weekend. Thanks, in any case. - What're you looking at? - Nothing. I don't like twilight. Wanna have dinner right away? No, I'd rather watch TV. Your wish is my command. - How about that? - Whatever! I'm beat. It'll clear out my head. Pour me a whisky, sweetie? On the rocks and lots of Perrier. - Patrick! - Yes? I heard some noise outside again. Are you sure? Listen! This house is too remote, you should get a dog. I don't like dogs. You heard that, right? It's probably nothing. Want me to go check? Yes, it must be a prowler. Not while I'm around! Be careful! Finally! Where were you? - Out. You tried to reach me? - For the last two hours. I have good news. You'll be a free man in a week. I'm marrying Marcello as soon as possible. I'm glad everything's working out. - What about the divorce papers? - Don't worry, I took care of it. - Thanks for calling. - We split the bill 50/50? No problem. How are you, mentally? - Still unhinged? - No, I don't think so. - Things have calmed down. - Still living in that hole? It's a nice town, though I won't settle here permanently. Met anyone? Please! Tend to Marcello and your art and leave me alone. You can count on that! You're a royal pain! No more brooding types for me! Thanks for calling. Bye, V?ronique. Bye. Evening. - My name's Robert Forestier. - What're you doing here? Are you a neighbor? Not exactly. This isn't your first time here. No, it's not. Don't come any closer! You want to call the police? I'll wait if you want. No, I won't call the police. But I don't want prowlers around here. I promise not to bother you again. I'm sorry I scared you before. I didn't mean to. I... What were you going to say? I'd like you to forgive me. I just liked watching you cook and going about your business. I can't explain it. You shouldn't be scared, I'm no criminal. But I felt lonely and depressed. And... Do you understand? Yes, I belt a bit depressed. And... the sight of you behind the window, for me, anyway, was a beautiful vision. Very reassuring. Are you cold? You should go inside. You're right. I best be going. No, wait. You said you were depressed. Yes. What I meant to say was, when I was sad, watching you made me feel better. - You seem so happy. - Really? Looks can be deceiving. Well... This is silly. Want to come in? Go on in. Have a seat. Want some coffee? No, it keeps me awake at night. - Mind if I have some? - No, of course not. My name's Juliette Volant. I know, I saw your name on the mailbox. - I work at the Vichy HBC. - The what? The Health and Beauty Center. I'm on vacation, so I'm fixing up the place. I'm from Moulin and came here to work. I didn't want to keep living at my parents'. I wanted to be free. All my friends said I was nuts, but I know I was right. This was my aunt's house, she did tapestry work. She passed away last year. That's Patrick, my fianc?. He's a pharmaceutical rep. Look. Magnesium, calcium... - For all my deficiencies. - Impressive! He's an impressive guy. Everybody tells me so. Do you live in the area? I work for a company in Vichy, but I'm from Paris. What do you do, exactly? - Anything to drink? - I'm fine, thanks. I draw... various things. It's interesting. I wish I could draw! Do you paint as well? No, I leave that to others. I also draw birds. I photograph them in full flight and capture that moment. What an odd encounter! - With the birds? - No, you and me! I should still be scared of you, but I'm not scared at all. On the contrary, I find you reassuring. Curious, no? Odd encounters are always curious. But I prefer meeting like this than through a third person. You believe in fate? I believe certain people represent certain things. When I was little, I met a man who represented death. He was a friend of my dad's who spent a few days with us. I didn't like him. A week after he left, my little brother died of meningitis. So what do I represent for you? A young woman with a lovely house, with a job and a fianc?, who's happy and fulfilled. I've never thought of myself as being fulfilled. No one does, but you're happy. Why were you depressed? Probably because life is meaningless when you don't share it with someone. But it got better when I started watching you three months ago. Three months? I started feeling your presence only two weeks ago. I guess I was taking more chances. Patrick is quite a handsome guy! - I'm scared. - Of me? No, of the wedding. Girls often get pre-wedding jitters. Men too... Have you ever been married? No... These cookies are delicious. I made them myself. Here, have the last one. If I'd known... Known what? That I was coming over? If ever you want to talk, give me a ring and come over. I'd like you to meet Patrick. He's on a three-day round. Really think that's necessary? We don't need to tell him how we met. I'll say a friend introduced us. He wouldn't understand otherwise. I think you're right about that. Here he is! Mr. Forestier! I have a package for you. A package? Go get the package, Bertrand. You're home early today. A young woman brought it over. I said it wasn't wise to leave it outside. That's sweet of you, thanks. Damn! Hi, it's Juliette Volant. - Hi. - Did you get my package? I was about to call to thank you. - How are you feeling? - OK. I thought maybe you could come over for dinner this week. That's sweet of you. But let me invite you to the Violon d'Ingres. - That's a fancy restaurant! - Does that scare you? I doubt you'll stick around here long. You seem like someone who prefers big cities. Will you and Patrick live here after you're married? Patrick wants to settle down in Clermont, on account of his work. But I'm not thrilled about it. You like your house? Yes. But mostly, I'm not sure I want to marry him anymore. Why not? I'm not sure I love him enough. I won't marry him! When did you decide this? Two days ago. You could just postpone it. It won't change anything, my mind's made up! - Have you told Patrick? - Yes. He thinks I'll change my mind. May I ask you a personal question? Sure, go ahead. Did you leave Paris because of a woman? No, no. A professional disagreement, and I had to vacate my apartment. Bon app?tit. We could go for a walk after dinner. Two lumps. I'll make you a chocolate cake tomorrow. I won't be able to come tomorrow. Expecting someone? No, that's just it! I'll go see who it is. Suzie! What's going on? I've been calling for two days. Is that Patrick? It's your life, I just wanted to see how you were. - Robert... Suzie. - Nice to meet you. A friend of Patrick's? No, Robert doesn't know Patrick. I see. So how did you two meet? Through a mutual friend. Want some tea? No, I'll come back some other time. I'll see you out, then. - Sorry, I couldn't have known. - Don't go imagining things...! That's my little brother. He was 12 when he died. I can see the resemblance. Now I'm always afraid of death. I'm scared it'll take me in the middle of the night. You shouldn't be scared of death. - Because you believe in God? - No! God is a cold and remote being. Death is much closer to us. People often dream of death, but never of God. - What are your dreams of death? - I have this recurring one. I'm in front of a huge mirror, but it's not me I see. There's a man sitting at a table. I approach him and he looks at me. He has jet-black hair and a gold tooth. I ask his name and he answers, "I'm Brother Death." - And he takes you? - No, I wake up. You shouldn't be afraid of death. Got a spare light bulb? Yes, in the kitchen. Good thing you're here, I hate anything electric. You shouldn't be afraid of electricity. My mom hates dealing with lamps too. She says men are useless, except when it comes to doing odd jobs. I didn't even hear you come in. This is Robert. Good day... Er, good evening. Juliette hiding you? - No! - I'm just passing through. I know, you met through a mutual friend. Already showed him your photo album? Forgot we were having dinner tonight? - I should be off, then. - Yes, you should. Suzie must've blabbed. - This couldn't go on, Juliette. - What couldn't go on? - Please! - Knew we were getting married? - Broke it off 'cause of him? - Certainly not! That's not what I heard! If I promise to stop seeing her? - Promise away! - You have no right! - It's an empty promise anyway. - I'm not to blame. - Happy now? - Who the hell is that guy? Robert! Here. - There was no rush. - My wife insisted. Thanks. See ya! I had a hard time finding you. I wanted to apologize for Patrick's rudeness. It was nothing, you shouldn't have bothered. Robert, I've thought if over, I really like you. Honestly, Juliette, you shouldn't... I'm not right for you. Why not? I'm not a normal kind of guy. If you heard what my wife said about me... Your "wife"? You said you were never married. Well, I lied! I have a wife who thinks I'm a basket case. - You have kids too? - No, no kids. I had a fight with my wife and left Paris. That's why I'm here. She left you, it happens. - Good, you're free. - Don't be childish! You lied to me and I'm not even angry with you. Give me a lift home, I don't want to take the bus. You know absolutely nothing about me! It's true, I'm unstable. When I was 20, I had a major depression. I was treated for six months. I was in pretty bad shape last year too. Even now, I have to try really hard to stay sane. Everybody's like that. Think spying on you for weeks is normal? No, but whatever, I still like you. I don't want to play games, Juliette. I don't think you are. You've been very honest with me. I'm capable of doing horrendous things! One night, I pointed a gun at my wife while she slept. I put the muzzle right next to her temple! It almost touched her! Did you shoot? If I had, she'd be dead. I doubt you could kill anyone. Only because no living thing is worth the bother. See? I know you better than you think. On the contrary. I used to be afraid of death. So I began thinking about it incessantly, till it became like an old friend. When I started seeing death that way, I saw the world in a whole new way. It's not sad at all, on the contrary. And after meeting you, I saw the world in a whole new way too. You're spouting nonsense, you're just a child! I'm 23 and I can't help loving you... Listen, we have to stop seeing each other. Sorry, but that's the way it is. - You don't like being with me? - I love being with you! - But I'd rather you be happy. - But I am happy! When I watched you through the window, I liked imagining you happy with your fianc?. That's all. Meeting you was a mistake. In any case, thanks for making me realize that I didn't love Patrick and shouldn't marry him. - I thank you for that. - Patrick won't feel that way. But that's the way it is. Goodbye, then. "Goodbye," then. Why're you sitting in the dark? - I was waiting for you. - Make yourself at home! I learned things about your Robert Forestier. I called his apartment in Paris. I spoke to his wife. A psychiatrist advised them to get a divorce. He's chronically depressed, an incurable pessimist. You should keep your distance. And you stop snooping around! Stick to you samples! Still, your friend is a nutjob. And it's not true that you met through a mutual friend. These can finally come in handy. Take two of these at bedtime to calm you down. His wife made me wonder about something. Was he the prowler, by any chance? - That's how you met him, right? - Beat it. - No need to get riled up. - Gimme the key and beat it. - Here, I wrote you a letter. - Gimme the key and beat it. Please let me in. What's going on? Let me in. It's kinda scary, but it's quite beautiful. I'm illustrating a bird-watching book. I thought we'd agreed to stop seeing each other. I know, I'm sorry. I couldn't help it, I just had to see you. I really tried. I thought I would die. Do you realize how complicated this could get? I love you. Don't be silly. I love you. I made you some coffee. You fainted. I'm being so much trouble. Not at all, don't be silly. I broke up with Patrick for good. He gave me back his house key. Here it is. You have a fever. I know. Mind if I sleep here tonight? OK, I'll sleep in the living room. - Want some pajamas? - No, I'm fine. I'm very tired, I want to sleep. It's sweet of you, thanks. Robert! Yes? I'm happy, you know. Forestier! Juliette was with you last night, wasn't she? - Ask her. - I'm asking you! But I already know the answer. Keep away from Juliette, OK? - You're out of the loop. - Or I'll smash your skull in! - He's all worked up! - He's a sad case. - Want me to get that? - No, I will! Hello? Oh, it's you! You sound less manly than last time. Just kidding! Juliette is living with him now. You must be miserable, but that's just like Robert. He's always been into young girls. Be patient, he usually drops them after six weeks. - What a bastard! - Don't fall apart, now! You should smash his face in to teach him a lesson. He deserves it, he's so deceitful. Unlike you, right? Can't you leave him alone? Bye, now! It's "Patrick," right? Call me anytime. Let me have some fun! Morning. - Morning. - I feel fine this morning. You're barefoot, you'll catch cold. My feet are always warm. This can't go on. You can't spend every night here. Vacation's almost over, I'll be going home. We'll be just as comfortable there. I don't want to be dragged into this. You could make me happy for a few more days. Your friend Patrick said he would kill me. Are you scared? No. But I hate scenes. I'm taking you home, you can't stay here any longer. Fine. - But promise to come and see me. - Calm down, Juliette! - Promise! - I promise. - I can leave you the key... - Out of the question! I'll leave it with you, come whenever you like. Whenever you like... - See how reasonable I'm being? - Yes, very reasonable. - What'll you do today? - Dunno, maybe sleep. - What an odd notion... - You know what Byron said? Sleeping and death are like brother and sister. Byron was wrong, and stop talking about death! Does it scare you? It must be fascinating to die with someone you love. No, certainly not fascinating. - You've never loved anyone. - Probably not. Not even... See you tonight, like you promised? Yes, I did promise. Tonight at the Violon d'Ingres? See you then. Morning. Forestier, right? - How's it coming along? - Almost done. I'm counting on you! Morning! Did you take the elevator, or did I imagine it? No, you didn't imagine it. Thought you were claustrophobic! I got help, I'm much better now. You look great today! Was it taking the elevator with the boss that did it? Not only. Things are finally falling into place, or rather, I'm falling into place! You're a real sicko! So I've heard. So how are you, Forestier? Huh, Forestier? You're a piece of shit, Forestier! Come on out, Forestier! Off to meet Juliette? You bastard! Would you like a menu, Miss? No... Yes, please. Here you go. What happened? It's nothing. I bumped... into Patrick. What did he do to you? He tried to hurt me, obviously. I'll explain after we order. Cassoulet de langoustine. Bon app?tit. - It's swelling up! - Does it hurt? It doesn't feel great. Don't know why I dragged him out of the river! - So you saved his life? - Not deliberately. The water wasn't very deep anyway. - Did he break a tooth? - No. Just loosened it. Good thing we have dentists! Funny how chipper you seem. It could've turned out worse. In any case, I'm going back to Paris after I finish up here. I thought you had to stay in Vichy for several months. I thought so too, but not anymore. I'm returning to Paris. What if I went with you? Don't be so hasty. I don't know yet. I hate making promises, so I don't want to make any promises. Maybe someday you'll love me enough to marry me. Don't wait for me, Juliette. I beg you not to wait for me. MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCE OF PHARMACEUTICAL REP But Patrick was pretty sturdy. He must've been taken off-guard. They're searching the river with a fine-tooth comb. I doubt Patrick drowned. Dead drunk, more like. Never considered he killed himself over you? No, he's not the type. It shows you've never had your heart broken. Hello? Robert? Did you see the paper? Patrick's missing. Yes, I just saw it. The only clues were three small buttons from a man's blazer. They're mine, obviously. I'd better turn myself in. But you didn't do anything! He's the one who attacked you, and you pulled him out of the river. And that's what I'll tell them. Wait a while, you could get into trouble. If I wait, it could be worse. One mustn't fear the police. I'll call them right now. There you are! Give him Room No. 3. What was the reason for the fight? He was angry with me for seeing Juliette. He'd already threatened me, so I was expecting it. His friends said he was quite a hothead. And nothing's going on between Miss Volant and me. That's good to know, crimes of passion are common. When you left, how far was he from the river? Dunno, it was quite dark. He was sitting, in a daze. Think he could've fallen back in? It's possible. There are boulders, he could've knocked his head. Some spots are three meters deep. You said he'd threatened to smash in your skull. What did you tell him? That he should go for it. That must've made his blood boil. What do you think, Miss? That he's getting drunk with pals. So you're quite optimistic. Please wait while I type out your statements so you can sign them. And you were right to report this so soon. Why say there was nothing between us? Because it's true. Why are you staring at me? You think I killed him? You should go rest. Yes. I think I'll go home. Mind if we stop seeing each other for a few days? We should've stopped from the start. You said I was the girl of your dreams then. You said I was the girl of your dreams! Dreams should remain in the realm of dreams. They shouldn't seep into real life. I should never have spoken to you. But you did. How I wish things had been different! I seem such a burden to you! Yet you sought me out and introduced yourself! Juliette! We're going around in circles! Only death seeks out people the way you did. No, he's not the most stable guy around. He's never been violent, but he does sow chaos. That's not what I meant, Captain. But he's bad luck. It rains every time it's his birthday! Here. Thanks. If he were dead, they would've found his body. You know the drill: All bodies immersed in liquid eventually end up resurfacing. I have the feeling everyone thinks I killed him. - No! - Oh yes. There'll be articles in the paper, and then a headline with an old photo of me. I'll look like the genuine article. Just wait! - But you're smiling! - A nervous smile. Like I'm caught in a spider web. Mr. Forestier... Am I interrupting? Hello, Captain. This is Jacques Constant. Captain Gr?goire, in charge of Patrick's case. - I'll leave you two... - I won't be long. I have a few questions for Mr. Forestier. - Coffee? - I'd love some. - I'll get you some. - Thanks. Any leads? Yes and no. We called your wife in Paris. She said you were unstable and prone to violence. Like I said, Patrick provoked me. That still doesn't explain the facts. There you go. Thanks. See you later, then. You can have him back in five. What can I tell you? You think I'm a murderer? How'd you meet Juliette Volant? What's that got to do with anything? She refused to answer that question too. I'm starting to wonder if it isn't some big secret. Maybe a madeleine will jolt your memory. I don't like plastic-wrapped pastries. A fussy eater! Did you know Patrick Soulage visited your wife in Paris? - No. - Well, he did. He said a man had prowled around Miss Volant's property, and that man was you. You didn't meet her by prowling around her property, did you? No. Good, 'cause prowlers are always nutjobs. These madeleines are really quite good. By the way, you were ill, right? - Ill? - Psychologically. - My wife told you that? - Yes. She could've gone on for hours, worse than a woman in love. She says you pointed a gun at her one night. It wasn't loaded. And she was the one who dared me. Dared you to do what? She said I didn't have the guts to shoot. It was her gun, I don't have one. This is all very confusing. You told Miss Volant the gun was loaded. Yes, it made for a better story. You like telling stories? With different versions. Your wife mentioned that. She knows you quite well, in the end. - How sweet of you to drop by! - Abstract art with a knife now? Indeed! I do what I like now. - Coffee? - I didn't come for coffee! In any case, it's atrocious. - But have a seat anyway. - Where? Seems you've got a girlfriend. Patrick told me, he keeps calling me. Where is he? No news since you chucked him in the river. But he wasn't your biggest fan. - Where is he? - Let go of me! You are mad! Marcello! Come see who's here. Come say hello to my husband. - Ciao, Robert. - Hello, Marcel. He left Vichy and his bird drawings to come see us. I'm being accused of killing a man. - Everything'll work out. - Not likely. - You should drop the girl. - It's not about her! They said I killed Patrick Soulage. You know, the guy who's always calling here. He came over, right? You'll be late for your meeting, unless you don't care... Sorry, Robert, but I really must be going. Bye, sweetie. Coming? I think he's scared of you. You think? - And are you scared of me? - Obviously, because I know you! You're a real nuisance! And a voyeur now! Is she nuts too? What else did he tell you? Sure you didn't hold his head underwater till he drowned? - I'm sure you know where he is. - Don't be silly! You like watching me squirm. You're very sexy when you're desperate! Just fess up and quit the games! Marcello'll be gone for at least an hour. I can't wait for him, extend my apologies! We have plenty of time. Don't tell me that Vichy girl fucks better me. I'm leaving. - You're still here. - No, I'm leaving! You sicko! Nutjob! - Mr. Soulage. - He's upstairs. Oh, it's you. Where's the cash? - Now quit hounding V?ronique. - She's doing the hounding! And this is just a loan. Don't push your luck. I've "disappeared," I can't write checks. - Just reappear, then. - This is my business! Right or wrong. You love V?ronique, I love Juliette. I'd do anything to get her back. This may not be the right way. Too late now! If you're not out by tomorrow, I'm informing the police. Suit yourself! Go now if you feel like it. - I oughta slug you! - You're too rusty! Hey, Mr. UNESCO! Here's a tip. V?ronique's a real bitch! I know. But I'm returning to Paris, sir. I never said otherwise! Though I'm perfectly happy with your work, I won't force you to stay. But you have to wait till things are cleared up. Have a seat. - Recognize this handwriting? - No. "Forestier has cast an evil and morbid spell "over Juliette Volant, an extremely na?ve girl, "even breaking up her engagement. "A company as important and respectable as yours "shouldn't keep him in its employ." It was typed and sent from Paris. Soulage obviously wrote that. He must be hiding out in Paris. I'm sure the cops could find him if they tried. Plus that letter is beyond idiotic. I never tried to cast any spell over Miss Volant, or over anyone else for that matter. What can I say? It was really delicious! Bravo! Really amazing! And stop worrying! Everything will be cleared up. "The night is long that never finds the day." "Macbeth"! Act IV. Robert! What a surprise... Evening, Juliette. My friends, the Tessiers. Robert Forestier, Fran?oise and Patrick Tessier. Nice to meet you, Patrick. Sir... I'll call you, dear. I haven't heard from you in a week. I didn't think you wanted to. Want to come in? All your friends are named Patrick! The other one sent an anonymous letter to my boss. - They found him? - No, he's still in hiding. What an idiot! I had time to knit you a sweater. Wow! I didn't know you could make birds with wool. It's magnificent. I'll hurry and finish the second sleeve so you can wear this next winter. It won't be long now. It's sweet of you to make me winter clothes. Your friends were looking at me very strangely. During dinner, they said you were the prowler, that you killed Patrick, that you were cold-blooded. They've got some nerve! They don't even know me. What'd you tell them? Nothing. After all, you were the prowler. Sleeping well these days? No, not really. I have more sleeping pills. No, thanks, I still have some. I came to see how you were. Why? I just felt like it. To see how you were making out. I'd best be going, no? Yes, you're right. Really think I pushed Patrick into the river? I think we should stop seeing each other for good. Am I disturbing you? No, of course not. I thought you might be in bed. No, I was knitting. You reek of whisky! - Want some? - No. You never used to drink. Knitting that for the new guy? Why'd you come over? Because I saw Robert's car on the road. Yes, he did drop by. You sent him packing, I hope. The way he behaved toward you! He pretended he loved you, killed your boyfriend, then dumped you. You should tell the police what you know. I know nothing. I'm scared, that's all. Of death, as usual. You're thinking of death because of him. You said so yourself. Feeling anxious? Sorry, Suzie, but I'd like you to go. I'd like to be alone tonight. Anything you want, dear. I'll come see you tomorrow morning, OK? Yes, tomorrow morning. Sleep tight. See you in the morning. "Dear Robert, I really love you, "differently from before, but much more deeply. "Now I understand you, I understand everything. "I hadn't realized until now that you represented death, "for me anyway. "I believe it's fate. "I don't know if I'm happy or sad, "but I do know I must die before this night is over." Hello? - Listen, Robert... - Marcello? First promise you won't tell the police or anyone else that I called you. I want to remain anonymous... Shit! You have my word, Marcello. Here's the thing, I know where Patrick Soulage is hiding out. Vichy Police Department, yes? No, the captain's in bed at this hour! I have an urgent message for him. I know where Patrick Soulage is. At the Alsace Hotel in Paris. How'd you find out? A friend called me. - What's his name? - He asked me not to say. How can we check otherwise? I just can't! I gave him my word. - Does he know Soulage? - Of course! He's not mistaken. Yeah but, it's still the same problem. I'll inform the captain as soon as possible. Yeah, that would help us out. And you too. Fine, sir. Good night. What's up? Something fishy's going on. Juliette? It'll all be over soon. My wife's lover from UNESCO knows where Patrick is hiding. - But I can't give his name. - Do it anyway! He insisted. Besides... Here comes my salvation. A friend of hers found the body. I'll fill you in on the way there. "Now I understand you, I understand everything. "I hadn't realized until now that you represented death, "for me anyway." You think I'm to blame? - No, she does. - Is that a joke? Death, a "joke"? She said I represented death, but how can a living being represent death? When did you last see her? - Last night. - How was she? She didn't want to see me anymore. She thought I'd killed Patrick. That's how you can represent death. Patrick's hiding out in Paris! Didn't you get my message? Yes, we're checking up on that. Only thing is, it doesn't change the fact that you pushed her to suicide. I never pushed anyone to suicide. Friends of Miss Volant's stated that you met her by prowling around her house. So? You told me the opposite. She took everything I said or didn't say literally. I was never able to get a handle on her. She had very deep thoughts, but I didn't want to think around her. That's what drew me to her. With her, I didn't want to think about anything. - But you slept with her? - Not even. You should have! I'm coming undone... I heard about what happened through a mutual friend. I'm really sorry. Poor dear, I'm sure it came as a big shock to you! I wanted to know if you felt at all guilty. Stop persecuting him! Maybe you should take a sleeping pill, but not the whole bottle like your girlfriend. I specifically asked for the captain. I doubt he'd want us to wake him! There should be a bullet mark. But there's nothing. Nothing. And the broken window? It could be a rock... - Then you'd find a rock! - True enough! Where'd they shoot? There, I was sitting by the phone. I want to see the captain! The captain won't say any different. - Were you drinking this evening? - Milk! I couldn't sleep. Have an apple next time. May I? Look! There it is. You're very pigheaded, Mr. Forestier! Yes. Speaking of my head, it could've been blown to bits. Take a look at this. Patrick's body was fished out this morning. - His "body"! - It could be. Same build. But this body's been soaking 10 days in a river. Lucky for you, there were crawfish. If we had proof it was him, we'd lock you up. We're looking for Soulage's dentist. We identify bodies through their teeth. This is absurd. Still, Miss Volant surely killed herself because she thought you'd killed Soulage. She was mistaken. I was shot at, and that's a fact! True, but if Soulage is dead, he can't be the shooter. Lots of people agree with your late girlfriend. That makes for a lot of potential killers. How so? Because they're scared of you. Why pursue me so doggedly? What? You've got some nerve! You've been here a year and I have a dead boyfriend and a girlfriend who killed herself! It wasn't my fault, and she wasn't my girlfriend! She was influenced by people's actions. - What people? - Friends of hers. Or people like you. And while you investigate, here's what'll happen. - I'll get shot. - It'll prove your innocence. Soulage shot at me last night. That body can't be his. Were you in love with the girl who killed herself? No, I just liked observing her. Too bad they saw you prowling around the house. Why? One has the right to look at people, no? Yes, naturally. I'm cold. - Shall we go? - Sure. - See you in the morning? - No, I'm really not up to it. - Phoned in sick? - I'll do it in the morning. What're you doing here? Hungry? I might have a little something. How about this? Now be on your way. Scoot! Police? Robert Forestier here. There's been another murder attempt. Our dog! That's our dog! He killed our dog! You're in luck, it missed the bone. Where's the captain? - Don't move! - I want to see him now! You stole our dog! It wandered over. I just gave it sugar. Why'd you want to see it dead? - I didn't kill it! - He's lost lots of blood. - What about our dog's blood? - Paper said he killed a man too! And now our poor innocent dog! - Go on, beat it! - There you are! Go on! Don't like needles? How do you feel? Dazed. Thanks for coming. They called me at work. If you're scared of being alone, you could come stay with us for a while. That's nice of you, but I think I'll leave here. We'll see. The police may not let you. You seem to be doing better. Can he be alone tonight? The captain and I decided it'd be best if he stayed with me tonight. We can play checkers. My late wife and I used to play. I prefer chess, but she found it too hard. Yet chess is so complicated, you give up trying to master it. While with checkers... - Checkers? - You can master it. It's hard, but possible. You know about my situation? Yes. The captain told me about Patrick's disappearance and your girlfriend's suicide. Said you might even be a menace. - Do you believe I am? - Not at checkers, at any rate. You have to take it. Indeed. - Looks like you're going to win. - It's without merit. And even if you did away with your rival, even if you were vile enough to push a girl to suicide, it doesn't change a thing for me. For three years now, since the woman I loved ceased to be, life and death are interchangeable and hold just as much interest, or lack thereof. You should go to bed now, you need the rest. Yes, you're right. - Can I grab a smoke? - Sure, take the pack. Good night, Doctor. Thanks for your kindness. Not kindness, simple vanity. Good night. Forestier! Don't take it so hard, at least you're still alive. - Where'd you put him? - In a cell. Go fetch him. Bastard! - How's the doctor? - In a coma, fractured skull. They're not optimistic. Who is, these days? Have a seat, I'll remain standing. Or I'll fall asleep! You're being a pain even at night now! What happened this time? I heard a gunshot and found the doctor at the foot of the stairs. He "fell" down the stairs! You heard: fractured skull. Soulage fired that shot! He must've followed us somehow. The man is out of his mind! - But you think he's dead! - No, that was a dead end. Soulage's dentist says your pal has great teeth, but the drowned man's were bad. But don't jump for joy. It still doesn't prove that Soulage is alive. I'm sure you'll understand I can't let you leave here. - You're arresting me? - There's a good chance. If only so I can get a good night's rest. Do what you think's best. You're an odd customer. I'm... desperate. The parameters of existence often elude us. I'll be right back. You can go home after all. - Do you mind? - What's up? Nothing for you to worry about. That's right, I have another "customer." Not glad to see me, huh? But I have faith in our justice system! You nearly killed me! You destroy everything in your path! I spit in your face, you evil bastard! Bastard! Young man? This way, please. Tell me, Soulage, why'd you come out of hiding? I couldn't take seeing that bastard free anymore. How about if we have some coffee? I admit I was the one who attacked him. But he had it coming! But he got the upper hand and tried to kill me. Since he tried to kill me, I pretended he really had. - So you planned the whole thing? - Not "planned" it. I can't explain it. I was in a kind of trance. I believe you still are. You don't think he's a bastard? Then you hid in a Paris hotel? Yes, with Mrs. Forestier's help. And she gave me money. The ex-Mrs. Forestier. I spoke to her. She says the money was a loan, on the condition that your returned to Vichy and reported to the police station. She's lying! She even slept with me. Twice! She says you're a little thug. The gall! She came on to me, didn't even wear panties! Relax! Coffee? Because of you, a man is in critical condition. - Dr. Lardy. - Don't know him. Know what you could get if he dies? I didn't shoot at him! You shoot willy-nilly! And what's more, it's illegal to shoot at people. So I'm locking you up, that'll cool you off. I didn't do anything wrong, Dad! Your mother sent this. These chocolates are for my son, officer. Don't bail on me, Dad. I didn't come here to bail on you. What'll do you? What got into you? I can't keep anything down. I've always been a disappointment to you. - School... - This isn't about school! Must be horrible for a man of your office to see me here? I could do without. You know the judge, you gotta vouch for me! Yes, I know him! He's the one who called me. I just want a temporary release. To prove that Forestier is behind all this. That man is the devil! He killed the woman I love, now he wants me in prison! - But the gunshots! - Try to understand. I couldn't let him get away with it! I felt so guilty for not doing anything. And he'd tried to kill me! Why not go to the police instead of disappearing? Your mother is beside herself! But I was so miserable, I just couldn't think straight! Poor boy! I hope this'll teach you a lesson. I got a temporary release! - When? - This morning! My dad's friends with the judge. Piece of cake. You lied to the police! - So did you! - Why go see them? Are you nuts? I know, it was stupid. I panicked. You didn't need to tell them anything. - Marcello has flown the coop. - Doesn't surprise me. - What a chicken! - I forbid you to judge him! - With all his money... - What can I do about it? Something very specific: Go to the Vichy police station and retract what you said about me! I don't want my name in the papers! No way! I won't go. I don't like threatening people, but you had better go. I just told the truth! I spent two days in jail! I never wanna set foot there again! Let me fill you in, Patrick. The vengeance of a woman is hell to bear! Trying to scare me? I don't have the strength to go back anyway. Then write them. First, the date. "Captain, "I lied "when I said I'd slept "with Mrs. Forestier in Paris. "The money she lent me... "Lent," not "lend." "...was meant "to pay for my return to Vichy." Now sign. OK. We should celebrate. If the doc dies, I'll be charged for it. Think it's possible? Not if you die first! Kidding, kidding! I don't know what's happening to me. All this is making my head spin. And it won't stop. Four bottles left of Marcello's champagne. You played a dirty trick on me. How could I know he'd split? Between Robert and Marcello, I see you like them a bit... - A bit what? - I can't put my finger on it. Don't you have any whisky? "Indecisive," maybe. Yeah, kinda soft. But you're not? No. Neither am I. Know what I'd like? For us to go to Vichy together. Just the two of us. To pay Robert a visit. Settle this once and for all. Wouldn't that be fun? Surprise! Hello, pal! Wait, I wanna talk to him. You dirty asshole! It's been quite a while. I wanted to see how you were doing. Isn't it stupid, Forestier? You're out of your mind! You made him out to be a loser. - This is fun! - Enough, OK! - He just loves dishes! - Here, catch! You're wasting your time! They're not my dishes! Telephone! Hey, Forestier, you shithead! Take that! Hello? Yes, I'll put him on. Robert, it's a woman. Thanks for calling. Bad news? The doctor died. He's dead. Drop the knife, I hate cheap brawls. I want a fair fight. You're lying! - He's not dead! - Call the hospital. It's you I'm gonna kill. Enough, now! Let go of that knife! My God! Do something! Jacques? Call a doctor and send him over, quick. Quick! Don't touch it! Don't touch it. Translation: Edouard Blinn ?pilogue
