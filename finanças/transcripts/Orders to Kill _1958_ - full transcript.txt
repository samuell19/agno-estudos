No,Sir,anyway the General just left again for Cairo so Col. Snyder,Lt take a look at this and let me know your views-Yes,Sir I've been with the free French Cmndt. Morand got a problem Morand tell Major Kimball what's you told the meeting -Good morning,Major -Morning Come on,come on,that's not what you told the meeting OK let's sit down Well,it's like this Last night,Andre one of our few remaining free French radio operators in the Paris area radioed London that he was getting off the air He said that Our Paris organization was furiously disturbed There were nine of our agents using one and the same man as an intermediary as a cutout between themselves and Xavier your radio operator Out of these nine four are dead Four out of nine? Well,who is this intermediary this cutout? He's a small time lawyer, a man called Lafitte Marcel Lafitte That ring a bell,Major? Yes,Sir,he's one of ours There's nothing on him Four out of the nine agents who used him as a cutout are dead Five if you count Xavier Did you know this,Major? No,naturally I,the free French losses that I never thought of tying in with Lafitte with we had no reason to suspect his loyalty with him Four out of his nine contacts dead? Five if we count Xavier's So you want him eliminated? With your agreement,he's your man You have it,we agree Thank you Well Who do we got to kill him? Who do we got? We,Sir? This is a big country with lots of people We got the free French into a jam,so we get them out Lafitte is our baby,we kill him Can you call off all his contacts and put in a substitute without him getting suspicious? Yes provided he thinks that the substitutes are only temporary But if you keep him eyed on for too long a month at most He'll know you suspect him He won't have time to think any such things,will he Major? No,Sir Major Kimball as my personal order to mount this operation and keep you informed at every stage of the mission will that solve your problem? It does,Col. I'm very grateful Have you any problems,Major? No,Sir Fine that's settled -Better make it quick -Yes,Sir Mitchell Yes,Sir Who we've got in Paris we can spare for a murder? Why? No one,Sir,that's not the way you work Thank you What's the mission? Well,the free French suspects Lafitte is sold out to the Germans Col.Snyder wants him eliminated Well,who've we got in reserve? Four radio operators No Dominic,he's in England now, he could be dropped next moon No,he's a fully trained battle loyal man We need him for our D day operations can't waste him on a job like this Who else? I've been looking in this file the one General Nolan sent,Cpt. Summers Lived in Paris until he was fifteen, speaks perfect French Silver star,DFC and Purple Heart, flew 50 missions before he was grounded The medical report said he's in first class physical and mental condition but his reflexes have become too slow for combat flying I get he's got tired All right Apply for temporary transfer from the Air Corps and have him reported to me as soon as he flies in tomorrow He looks possible but send him right over to screening camp Can't tell him anything specific until he's been cleared with the psychiatrist I am sorry,no OK,Doc,look I'll buy all that but precisely what's wrong with him? In an ordinary context nothing, he's a nice normal guy -So? -So this in ordinary context You don't want a nice normal guy,you want a nimble witted thug Are you telling me he has no courage? I'm telling you he's overanxious to prove that he has Oh,ball then,damned he doesn't need to prove it -Have you seen this,his flying records? -Yeah It's all here in black and white and blood and guts He's been terrific brave This what I mean What do you mean as what you mean? I mean terrific bravery isn't the sort of bravery you need for this job We need a mixture of levelheaded shrewdness, maturity,tough unimaginative nerve Who says he's imaginative? Look what does he say to you about bombing He said when you drop bombs you don't think what might happen when it goes off,he said if you drop bombs or you don't win wars Now don't tell me that's being over imaginative There's a heck of lot of psychological difference between being unable to imagine something or not allowing yourself to imaging it I think and I wouldn't know without deep analysis Look,doc,doc,quit stalling I need this job done,and need it done quick because Because Frenchmen are dying Give me a straight answer,could he do it? I'll give a crooked one He might Cpt Summers You must have killed a hell of a lots of Germans in that fighter bomber yours How do you like kill us one man? Well,you don't have to say yes right away You were going to say yes,weren't you? Yes Sir Well,now was the time to say no if you wanted No one is going to call you coward nobody going to think you are yellow They better not Go back to the air corps there will be nothing about this interview in your record sheet and get yourself a good desk job My point of view there is still a minimum risk you don't know who we want you to kill or how or where If you got drunk and shouts your mouth off you know great harm done, except for yourself of course we'll have you court-martialed Now,a fine morning Take a walk for half hour Take an hour,I don't mind Or have yourself a talk with Abraham Lincoln statue or have yourself a coke at the drugstore,think it over How about things? I don't feel like a walk,Major Meaning? Meaning I must have killed hundreds of German like you say Meaning I guess I could kill you one more And I sooner talk over it with you than Abraham Lincoln Good boy I had a hunch you're our man OK sit down,Gene Sit down and listen First you got a German He's a Frenchman Does that make a difference? No but I He is the link,of what we call a cutout within a half a dozen groups for our cells of espionage organization in Paris Which I believe is a city you know something about,eh OK,now in the past three months 45% of our agents who have contacted this cutout had been arrested They are dead You know why? On account of he sold them down the river to the Germans so we want him dead and dead quick That's an outside job Intelligence missions can't avoid risk and security without any strong arm staff You're to be the strong arm stuff How soon can I get going? How many times have you jumped? I bailed out twice Did you break anything? My watch That's saves us a week Did you go on OK with the British? Sure OK we'll have you trained in England instead over here And you'll be ready to be drop at first available moment Remember You're still not fully committed I'm not risking the security of a top priority mission on a snap decision with either one of us You can still back out during training or we can kick you out Until we're sure you're the right man and you're sure We'll just skip the details,OK? OK Any general questions? Yes,Sir,three Shoot One When I've killed this guy do you get me out of France or do I wait and have a date for you on D day? We'll get you out Two do I get any furlough? 48 hours Three What do I tell them at home? I must say,Gene 48 hours seems ridiculous little after two years overseas Are you sure they didn't say forty eight days? I guess they just can't win the war without me Is it flying? No,Louise,it's not flying any more Is it hush hush or can you tell us? What is hush hush? Pst,pst Ah, well if it is pst pst I'd better go into the kitchen Nonsense,Louise,you're not Mata Hari No,but you are a good cock That soup is terrific Avant cette preuve tois And for Mickey Hi,thee What is the job,dear? Well,I guess it's all Louise's fault for having taught me to speak French Look everyone knows the second front is bound to open up on the spring And sooner or later there's going to be fighting in France Ella van Horn says Belgium Will you be fighting in France,dear? Mother I'm not qualified to fight anywhere outside an airplane I'm not allowed to fight an ant any more What a use But I do speak good French,grace a tois So I'm to go to England to do liaison Is liaison a desk job? Mother can you imagine me do a crummy desk job? No Liaison is a sort of mobile I'm to be part of the organization that has to co-lead and co-ordinate our tactical and strategical plans for the free French forces in England That means conveying the gist of high level conferences to the free French HQ and being a sort of bellhop between then top brass on both sides like,maybe between General Patton and General Leclerc or getting smart enough even Eisenhower and de Gaulle And the doing the same sort of things when we invade Wherever Ella van Horn says we are going to invade That'll be in the back areas When the shooting is all over When the war is over I hope know so many generals I'll be asked by all the biggest corporations in the States to become Vice president in charge of making friends and influencing people or something Gosh I may even get to run somebodyâ€™s political campaign I'll be sitting pretty for life Mother I guess that I'd better get used to being the mother of a very important man You'll be able to write? Sure,mother,sure,every three weeks like I always have Every two,dear Well,I'll try for two till we cross over then I maybe be a bit busy I'll be able to send the cookies and things While you're in England I mean Well,we'll be moving about quite a bit Oh,I dare say they could forward them,did you? Yes,sure -I can't wait -Surprise,surprise Remember there was a time she made me meringues and it took twenty four seconds,sing about that,Louise,it's only take five It's quiche Lorraine and in Boston I hope that very soon you'll be eating one in Paris We'll drink to that -To Paris -by London Well,what's it feel like being a civilian,Mr Summers? Not so good,Sir Kind of deglamoured,ah? I guess you'll be used to it That's one of the reasons we wanted you to wear these clothes now Even before you started training and also to look like less new Stand up in the middle of the light,will you please,let me have Yes you know these are made right here in London And got a French right down to the last button This,one thing our tailor couldn't give them,less age Well,you got about a month to do that in You'd better eat a lot of soup Yes,Sir That's another thing Now that you're civilian,drop the Sir I want you to get out the habit of it -My name is Mac -Mine's Gene No,it isn't Not anymore It's Jean That's a further thing you'd had to get used to like the clothes From now on your name is Jean Jean Doumier,write it down Doumier,D O U M I E R Yes Now again like you were signing it,please You needn't much practice Where did you learn French copperplate? Lyce? And partly in public from an old French nurse maid Well,in that case This,sign right here -From Washington? -Yeah It came over with you on the plane No,not with that pen This got a proper nib French ink I think we'll photograph you after your hairs Well,a little longer There That's the way you'll always sign All right Who are you? Jean Doumier Good I'll tell you more about yourself after you got settled down and school School? Oh yes See my Sgt at the end of the corridor down here he's already arranged transportation for you over to station 31 That's where you're going to be trained Run by the British -OK? -OK,Sir OK what? OK Mac Jean Jean Come and kill me Come on Thank you,that was a beautiful death Well,by now you'll have realized that this particular series of lectures is designed to show that an agent's behaviour should never be conspicuous I'm thinking it applies to passwords Passwords are used as an additional recognition check between two contacts who may have been described to each other but who have never actually met They must be one,conversational and not dramatic I mean as if you look after a fellow who you think is your contact and say "The black panther arrives again tonight" And he turns out to be a member of the Gestapo in civvy Well This is what I call my "tunnels of love" She's contained six Germans You have exactly six rounds in your revolver Don't waste them on the first one you see Only that moment the Germans shoot you out when you run out of ammunition All right,in you go Now Jean Sch They are not expecting you to tea First thing you must remember if you want to kill somebody begin quietly All right now,start again That's better Good They've heard you now Go on Well,done Carry on Now in here Big drive Go on quick And now what do you propose to do? Spit in his eye This afternoon you're going on your first subversive exercise In Bournemouth You work as a pair and you plan a joint cover story to conceal the nature of your clandestine activities In case you are interrogated as I warned you,you maybe any time after the exercise -Is that clear? -Yes And that cover story, if you remember your lectures should be as near the actual truth as security allows And how long did you and Knowles followed the sales girl About 20 minutes,I guess so What was she wearing? I can't really remember Oh,come now You followed her for 20 minutes and you can't really remember what she was wearing I assume she was wearing clothes Yes,Sir What sort of clothes? -Well,coat -What coat? -An overcoat? -Yes,Sir -It was cold there -Yes,so it has And it's going to be a cold night Now then What color was this overcoat? I can't remember,Sir More sure we try putting our hands above the head until we do remember Higher Thank you -Hi,Mac -Keep your hands above your head What color was this overcoat? The overcoat of this girl you and Knowles said you followed for 20 minutes A sort of blue What sort of blue? Light or dark? Medium Her hat? Color of her hat She wasn't wearing hat Sir Medium blue overcoat No hat Knowles said this first girl you followed was wearing a red beret Raincoat,which you get lying You can't both be telling the truth you know Come on,come on which of you is lying? Keep your hands above your head Knowles said this girl had a little dog Did you see a little dog? -Yes,Sir -Oh you did,did you? Come on did you? Yes Sir I find him wrong Knowles said nothing about a little dog Nothing But you saw a little dog,eh Why didn't Knowles? Come on Why didn't Knowles notice the little dog? We were just looking at the girl,Sir,I guess Knowles Oh,you guess,you guess I'm not interested what you guess I'm interested in what you know, now what do you know? We were following this girl In no hat,a red beret a raincoat a medium blue overcoat, with and without a little dog We were following this girl Put your hands above your head Get out Jean Jean Here You'd better put it on Like you said it's been a cold day Flunked,didn't I? Yeah,you flunked,all right Well,I never know anybody who didn't on his first interrogation This is typical Typical first interrogation and for Pete's sake don't get discouraged You heard enough lessons that it make a lot harder for us next time The same wise you you should have stepped closer to the truth in your cover story Why bring in girls? For what? People do you know we did try to bully you and make it sound ridiculous but it's not ridiculous As long as you and Knowles could have agreed on one or two things you might have talked about like you were walking and slow down your tempo You know if you end for something fast,nothing slow didn't when you were lying Answer everything slow and Never,never trust a kind face when you met its owner only once OK Your own face is beginning to look like it didn't belong to you -Where's your room? -Over there You'd better get some sleep you got an even tougher interrogation coming up in the morning -What about? -About you,Jean Doumier I'm going to tell you all about yourself Who your parents were,where you were born where you went school,work -Is this it? -Yes Then get into it! -Good night,Jean -Good night So much for you Now you know all about you,Jean Monsieur Jean Doumier Now for your target Here His name is Lafitte Marcel Lafitte Marcel Lafitte He looks like a real rat Would it matter if he didn't? Oh Mac,what's legally do you think I am This's the guy I got to kill in a kind if he's a traitor I don't kill him if he looks like George Washington What's does he do for a living beside from informing on his friends He's what you call a huissier(bailiff) processeur deliver writs I think he does some small time legal work on the side Where does he work? He has an office in the Avenue du Maine In the 14 arrondissement Here But he lives in a little cul de sac right up here off the Rue de la Gaite Oh,it's a nice place I know that district I used to be taken to see plays there You know matinee for kids What's the cul de sac called? L'impasse de la Gaite Gaite's dead end Kind of appropriate Yes,it's more appropriate when you think it ends in the cemetery Yes,so it does,La cimetiere du Montparnasse My nurse usually brought me back to it after the theater You know I liked the cemetery better than the theater as you know how it is,for more adults -What's the number of the house? -Number 3 Oh,it's right next door to the cemetery -It's funny -What's funny? Monsieur Lafitte is number three right next door to the cemetery You're a lyric writer,ah? What's the music? It's sort of French rhyme called "Cadet Rousselle" My nurse used to sing it to me whenever she gave me something special to eat You know I could sing it to Monsieur Lafitte when I Yeah You know You can do a lot worse than compose yourself a set of lyrics around the house numbers the names I have to give yo and then savior it to yourself till you remember them Mac,I thought I only had to kill a guy now I got to write poetry Monsieur Lafitte I must explain works on the Avenue du Maine When every day he likes to go once a month to cafe Bertolo Monsieur Lafitte said number three right next door to the cemetery Impasse de la Gaite he will be dead at the end of the day,how's that? That's good,that's You forgot his office number Three or four,how it was Coming to number three or four Monsieur Lafitte walks up one floor Correct crap short and sweet that is the end of Monsieur Lafitte Well,here he is now look don't sing him your lyrics He knows what you got to do but he doesn't know where and to whom his job is to suggest how -Hey,commander -Hello Come aboard Do come in I'm sure you like a cup of tea -Yes,yes thank you -Pray be seated Oh,excuse me just one moment So sorry I should have warned you I've just been doing a little research Jean,you'll find some sugar in tin up there on the chimney piece No not that one,that's gun powder The other one I'm afraid there's only tins Your problems I understand from Major MacMahon is to dispose of an elderly adversary,sugar? No thank you Help yourself An elderly adversary will probably be not settled if he's unarmed Perhaps in his office Now in office,please suppose there's a desk At the ordinary course of events You'll be talking to him from the other side of it And he's no good at all unless you can shoot him Can he shoot him? No,no certainly not it's got to be of a standard search apart that shooting is so noisy I quite agree So I limit this in two ways One,you should kill him with an instant weapon over the bare hands And two if he is sitting in his desk you must kill him from behind I'll be reading over his shoulder or something Precisely,come and do it Try to have a new strangle hold No it won't work I'll lean forward I tuck my chin in and protect myself But if I sit that moment schlepped You know that'll do provided he leaned back far enough And you were sufficiently at a control to be a speed up master you were then Couldn't I maybe just strangle him with my thumbs like this Well,you could try but I found it takes absolutely hours Let's talk about innocent weapons Take knifes for instance innocent knifes Boy scout knife H section if you need it pick him up French model For your good deed We want to kill him quickly and cleanly without just shove that in any idiots were We have to use it surgically you have to stun him first What do we get use for that? How deftly I know there it is, a pair of socks -Socks? -Exactly that,socks Go outside and find a stone about the size of a goose egg Mother's work basket Here they are Just the job Would one of these do? Yes,we'll have that one Come along Santa Claus pocket in there Hold that and we pull the second one over it Dear me I keep forgetting that table belongs to minor operations Of course if you use this with confidence you'll do more than stun him you'll crack his skull as neatly as a chef cracks eggs BTW don't forget the stone in it Otherwise not awfully effective And all you have to prepare is a pair of rather dirty socks they are bound to be a bit dirtier afterward Take it to the laundry the whole contraption fits neatly and inconspicuously in your raincoat pocket Of course if you do only stun him then you got to finish him off with your boy scout knife Now open your shirt Where do you keep your heart? Here I guess Then you're a grotesque Put your finger halfway between your left nipple and the base of your sternum My what? Sternum boy your breastbone Now move it up an inch What do you feel? A rib Thank heavens for that,you are normal Now just above your finger you'll find the space between that rib and the one above,got it? Right,that's where your heart is And that's where you puncture him It's a pity we can't use a knitting needle and then you wouldn't bleed at all I suppose you can't make it plausible for Jean carrying a knitting needle I'm sorry So,there it is,when do we start practicing? A lot now we can't,Sir I've got four minutes to get to the lecture the conditions is in a.. conditions in a French city I'm going to All right run along Mr Security of 1944 I'll see you after supper OK Thanks Commander,it was swell I'm worried Yes This whole business to him is nothing more than Well,you just heard him "Thanks Commander it was swell" You know Except for one moment in his first interrogation I don't believe he's ever started to think what is really going to be like over there? He's play acting And he's loving it -Commander -Yes This is none of my business And I maybe sticking my neck out But don't you think that in this particular case It might be better if you didn't encourage him to love it quite so much I mean as if somebody got to tell him that killing a man is not a game You thought about that? Yes Very often But should Jean? Should he? You know the other thing about war is as we grow more civilized So do our work killing,no I mean that When we were still savages Anyone wasn't feeling guilty about killing a man with our bare hand as we do now you could almost measure out the sense of guilt with a range finder Major I wish I was training pilots to drop bombs My job here is harder I've got to stop civilized men from thinking about the reality of killing a fellow human being with their bare hands Because if they thought about it they might never do it They've got to do it just as Jean got to do it So what can I do? I can turn the act of killing into a cross between a game and a drill Or I can drill them and drill them And drill them Until it becomes automatic Did you see Jean get that stranglehold on me just now when I was sitting at the desk? He wasn't thinking of the way my eyes popped out of my head if he had he'd muffed it It was a conditioned reflex And that's the way I hope he behaves when he comes to do the real job I don't mind if he's sick afterward We're only concerned that he isn't sick before Good evening,can I take your coat Next port is good Sir Take off in about 15 minutes Hi Pat Come to our first class waiting room -Will you ring if any questions? -Yes,thank you Gosh I feel good Where did the British army cooks learned to fried chicken southern style?

Somebody who killed a German officer in Rue Froidevaux two nights ago He's supposed to be hiding in this district Well,I don't suppose you did it for a moment But even innocent young loiterers have the disadvantage of being able bodied run the risk of being picked up and sent to work in Germany They may well need electrical mechanic Where do you live? Across over the cemetery It's too far -Come to my office -I can't Everybody will have gone home it's quite safe a place to hide oneself I have to lock you in of course I let you out at half past eight in the morning I promise If the telephone rings don't answer it there's no reason why it should be answered I'm always home by six o'clock And if anyone knocks don't answer that either There's drinking water in the cabin there Have you had your dinner yet? No Not the cat it's only bread -No I can't -Please take it I shall be dining at home with my wife and daughter And take my coat too You can use it as a blanket Really,Monsieur Lafitte There's such a little way to go and it's quite warm for the time of the year Don't switch on the light when it gets dark as no proper black out I'll be back at half past eight in the morning Oh thank you,thank you -Good night -Good night Don't go near the Cafe Bertolo Think yourself lucky,you're only hungry, you're not even deserved to be alive Question is does your master Does he? -Good morning -Good morning I hope the raid didn't disturb you They went away very quietly Yeah,so did the men they took Except one Good morning,Minou I see you discovered my guilty secret Ah,well,I knew it was safe in your hands She wants her breakfast Here we are,come on There we are There you are,Minou As I speed it up You know,I think I reclaim my overcoat it's much colder today Of course Thank you It's very undignified having to work in one's overcoat How else can one keep warm? No,no,no,Minou No more until tomorrow Oh well come on,here we are She really is a guilty secret We're not supposed to keep animals in this building even in peacetime But I had to bring her here because my wife,blessed her dear,thrifty heart so we couldn't afford to feed her anymore and must get rid of her,get rid of her How does one get rid of a little cat? Sell her for 50 francs to Cafe Bertolo? Threw her into the Seine? Strangle her? It's all very well just to talk about it,Monsieur Doumier But you can't just strangle a little cat Now,can you? No This is Guermants 6493 Aunt Leonie? Is that you Raoul? Yes Have you finished the job? No,may I come and see you? Very well Come at seven -At seven,couldn't I come.. -At seven I might have done it then when I was helping him on with his coat or even when he stood down and stroke the cat Of course I didn't I couldn't You see,I'm not convinced that he's guilty I'm not convinced that he's guilty and I can't kill an innocent man Now I think he may be innocent for four reasons One he warned me against the Montparnasse raid and probably saved me from being catered off to do forced labor in Germany A collaborator wouldn't have done that Two.He let me spend the whole of the night alone in his office and I was able to go through all his papers I found nothing people denounce one and another for no better motive than greed or ambition or sheer personal spite Well you yourself said that people did it for hate and greed? I think Lafitte may be a victim of that sort of denunciation An innocent victim You said there were four reasons There are Only I saved the fourth for last because it is a sentimental one you might understand it because you're a woman I don't believe that anyone in Paris today who can't bring himself to drown a cat or sell it for the pot and even let it starve could possibly send human beings to the torture chambers or the firing squad That's all What exactly do you want me to do? -I don't know I only know.. -Do you mean organize A court of inquiry, investigates Lafitte's guilt? No but perhaps Do you want me to send you back to England? If there's need we'll do that you know Of course not but perhaps we could radio to our people in London and have them reexamining the whole affair and then they still feel he's got to be killed well I'll go ahead and do it Splendid Sit down Sit down and listen to me you little fool How long have you been here? A week tomorrow You're an optimist If you go on behaving like this there won't be any tomorrow You won't just be sniveling to me you'll be sniveling to the Gestapo Things must be very bad when they send us a child to do a man's job Did they tell you your mission was secret? Yes Then why have you broken every rule of security by blabbing it to me? -Because I thought that -What did you think? That he might be innocent Were you ordered to signed out whether he was innocent or guilty before you killed him? No Were you taught at school for every time our radio operator send the message it makes it that much easier for the Germans to get a fix on this transmitter -and set -Yes -And torturing -Yes And then kill him And yet after six days in France you have the impertinence to suggest that we fidget away our precious time on the air to London by drafting and ciphering and transmitting a personal message from you asking your people to disbelieve evidence which has been gathered against Lafitte by real agents who been working here for years It's not your business to sit in judgment of Lafitte it's your business to kill him Dozens of Frenchmen have risked their lives receiving and guiding and hiding and clothing you only have you go to beat us because of a stinking cat which should have been carved up and eaten months ago Himmler like cats Goering like pictures,Hitler like music Goebbels is a wonderful father What are they? Did they order you to come to Paris kill Lafitte and clear out? Yes Then why don't you obey orders and do it? Just because you are wearing civilian clothes doesn't mean you aren't a soldier -Because you've never worn a uniform -I have one uniform I was a fighter bomber pilot for the American air corps and I flew 50 missions How dare you tell me that? You break security about your new job through weakness and you break security about your old job through vanity You maybe don't you realize you just proved yourself to be so weak there's nothing left to be vain about He may still be innocent What if he is? What if he is? But that would be murder Murder? But this is war,war And in a war the innocent and the guilty get killed together When you were ordered to drop bombs over France did you refuse because it might have killed innocent Frenchmen? Or women or children like yourself Or cats? Or are you such a magnificent marksman you can press a button and drop a bomb which only will kill Germans and collaborators Didn't go whining back to your superior officers saying I couldn't do it there might have been a man in the marshalling yard who loved his mother then why are you whining at me I'm not your mother I'm not anybody's mother Not anymore Oh Jean It happens to all of us,sometimes early sometimes late It's not so much the danger of what we have to do but the loneliness in which we have to do it Often quite easy jobs which we have to do secretly in lieu of the hard and difficult jobs which you can talk about to somebody else You got the worst of both worlds your job is difficult and you got to do it alone You can't talk about it You got to forget you ever talked about it to me If I'm caught I'll have to try and forget too Please,please remember that loneliness is your worst enemy Remember that however great your difficulties is you must talk about them only to God If you don't believe in God then there's nobody Nobody That's why I shouted at you a little So you'd remember Your shout was very quiet You have to learn to be quieter than that You have to learn to be silent Yes So have to learn not to be deceived by appearances Lafitte's appearances? Yes Well,my reasons for his innocence are very stupid No,they weren't stupid You left out all the other reasons on the other side for his guilt What reasons? He saved you from a police raid but what if he did? It didn't cost him anything It would be a very good story to tell us ever he was suspected of collaboration by the resistance But how did he know there was going to be a police raid? You found no incriminating documents in his office why should you? He's worked for us since 1940 Did you find any documents about his dealings with the resistance? Of course you didn't Anyway he's not a key man According to you he would only been in contact with key men he wouldn't have it afterward He pass verbal messages on from one key man to another When it suits his bank balance he'd sold the same messages to the Gestapo You're still worried about the cat No Give me one or two more days Then I'll ring up and say "Aunt Leonie the job's done" And you could send me back to England Now for better Jean,we're all cowards about something I am When I think about being caught and tortured Because I don't know my own breaking point So the reasons I was angry just now If I'd heard only one word more than I need to because I don't want to betray anybody At least of all you Why me? You're not like the rest of us you still believe the best of people War hasn't corrupted you yet Oh my young friend -What luck -What? Is this a social visit or were you coming to consult me professionally? About a social visit I was going to return your hospitality by asking you to have a drink with me at the Bertolo Oh,thank you,thank you but I've got a much better idea You're going to have a drink at my house No,monsieur Lafitte that was not what I meant But it will be when you heard the news My wife has discovered about Minou She's under sentence of death not my wife,the cat But you can save her Monsieur Doumier can save your life,sit down I though at the moment I saw you that's what comes of having a legal mind You're a friend of mine and you have a friend in the country who is plagued with mice and rats Tonight in front of my wife you take Minou from me and give her to your friend in the country But I have no friend in the country What difference will that make? At least me with a cat,I don't want a cat Well,of course you don't want a cat Tomorrow morning I have to be here at 7 o'clock and meet a client who's going to pay me some money What could be simpler At half past seven you come here with Minou in her little box and you give her back to me You see And then at lunchtime we'll go and spend some of my client's money at the Cafe Bertolo It'll be in cash it's that sort of business deal One has to live Well? -Half past seven tomorrow morning? -Yes You're sure your client would have gone? I mean I'd look like a bit of fool walking into your office with a hungry cat meowing into the holes of the cardboard box No,no,no he'd gone by then I want him off the premises before the concierge gets back from the breadline All right I'll do it I knew you would Come Minou the death sentence has been suspended -I live at number 3 -Really? After you That's better I always give the D sign -Hep father -Mauricette This is a friend of mine,Monsieur Doumier In you go my dear fellow,in you go That's fine Have you brought me a present,papa? No my dear That's a present for Monsieur Doumier It's Minou Oh,there you are,may I present Monsieur Doumier Monsieur Doumier,my wife Monsieur Doumier has a friend in the country whose farm is absolutely infested with rats and mice He's been trying to find a cat for weeks He'll be very happy to have Minou What does he offer? Oh my dear Monsieur Doumier has been extraordinary kind enough into deliver my note to his friends personally I brought him back to ask him to take a little aperitif Mauricette Show Monsieur Doumier into the drawing room while I get the glasses And give Minou some milk Water After you,dear "You want to bring that young man in to the home" "My dear" "You could have given the wretched cat.." -Do you go to school,Mauricette? -Yes What subjects do you like best? Dancing Before Christmas we danced the story of Cinderella Who were you? Were you Cinderella? No,I was one of her sisters Because of my glasses Mother Superior said Do you like dancing? Yes Can I dance for you? That'll be very nice Would you like to sit down? I'm sorry for being so long I had a little difficulty getting Minou back into her box I see Mauricette been entertaining you Yes,very well My wife sends her apologies fact she's not feeling very well, it's been a hard day at the shops And she's,something of an invalid -Your health -Yours Thank you,Monsieur Lafitte, thank you very much Mauricette Oh,my dear fellow,must you really be going? Yes,I'm afraid so I'll got to report to my shop and see what jobs are for tomorrow Don't forget you are doing a job for me in the morning Oh,wait a minute You forgot Minou Half past seven -Who's that? -Jean Doumier Oh my dear fellow I do apologize Come in Come in I was just counting my ill-gotten gain Oh dear that window Tonight I'm going to surprise the family These chicken A real rabbit I suppose you do know anybody who sell me a rabbit Of course you don't,never mind you can sell me a cat for the price of the drink at the death Come along,here we are Hello dear There's a good girl Come on I got a lovely little news for you Why? -Maid,may I use your telephone -Of course This is Guermants 6493 -Aunt Leonie -Hello,hello If I say hello that's the danger thing Hold the line,keep away,keep away Thanks Major These trays I mean, Colonel, I'm not used to it yet I'm not either And I'm still not used to working in Washington through August Like a steam laundry You know I sweated through two shirts this morning and it's not even noon yet What a war I guess you won't have to be here much longer,Col. The news is good Patton crossed the Seine at Mantes Well that old son of a gun Right flank at Fontainebleu A few more days I think Bandelor and LeClerk's tanks move on Paris Eisenhower wants the French to be first in For Pete's sake where are my traveling orders,I got to be there What about Pierre? Pierre was arrested in February Deported to Germany I've seen his life as no news Just has to wait -Dominic? -Dominic is still over drunk Anything more about Leonie? Tortured and shot,end of April She didn't give anything away She managed to live a message for Summers Just before Gestapo came for her It was too late How do you know? I saw him Gene Summers? Yeah He's alive? Yeah Well,I'll be.. Mac,notify the general, will you? And his mother too,of course I have That's real piece of luck I'm not so sure if you think it's a real piece of luck after you've seen him What's the matter with him? Is he hurt? Mentally,an MP picked him up He was trying to steal a bottle of brandy from a jeep He wasn't just pie-eyed he was sowed he was stood in alcohol That's No,no seems he hadn't run a sober breath since he did the job That was a couple of months ago We should thank the Good Lord that he was lying around in gutters where nobody bothered to pick him up You know when he heard the MPs talking English He gave his old Air Corps rank and serial number over and over and over again So they turned him over to the medics They got him rather tried to pump the liquor out of his system Where is he now? Base Hospital St Cloud Have you told him we found out that Lafitte was innocent? No That might finish him off all I gather Well,take care of him,ah? I think you ought to see him Me? You're his boss,you recruited him I think maybe you might be able to help him and pull himself together So what do I tell him? I don't know might Tell him we think he did a valuable job He might believe you Hi Gene Well Hi,Gene Got hours since we met,eh Me on one side of the desk and you on the other -Remember -Mm I asked you to do a job Ah Well,you did it,Gene You're fine We're real proud of you You're proud? Sure,proud It was a valuable job,well done Of course,we know you hit the bottle after you've done it But who doesn't ah? You're probably get the same thing after a bombing mission This was a little tougher than a bombing mission For this time he hit a good nigh I'm going to gave in and go to celebrate with Look What's it matter anyway,ah? You're OK now Skip it No,you see I hadn't any money When I killed him I took his to make it look like a robbery I hid it in a grave And the one day I went back and I took one note out of the grave because I needed a drink And in the end I took it all When I hit him He laid quite still I thought he was dead Then He turned over He looked at me Said Why Could I told him why? Sure You sure could have,Gene Look I don't know if it helps We found out that Lafitte was a worse traitor than we thought He penetrated our Paris circle about as deep as anyone could And when you killed him He could have given away about twenty key agents If they'd been caught and tortured They each could have informed against 20 more that's maybe 400 lives you saved 400 good lives for a real lousy one And each of those good lives Made it possible to liberate Paris that much sooner And save more lives still My guess you could chalk up all over thousands lives you've saved Just for killing one man,when you did Doesn't that answer your question? Yes Thanks Major Colonel Congratulations Well I feel as allowed to be congratulating you I'd better be going Look if you need anything just let Mac now,eh I'll see you now I'll be back Well,that'll do the trick ah? Don't you think? I hope so Well,let me know,ah -I'll see you -Thank you for coming Mack,how much back pay am I due for? I don't know I'll figured it out Or could I have it all? In cash Or in allied currency,yeah Could you fix for me to wear an air corps uniform? Why? I guess so He overplayed it,didn't he? Overplayed? Mac I know Lafitte wasn't as important as all that He was a small timer he had about 6 contacts Look Mac while Kimball was talking, suddenly I understood something Leonie once said to me In a war innocent people and guilty people get killed together I didn't refuse to drop my bombs, did I? because they might kill an innocent person I just obeyed orders and dropped them What was so different about obeying orders and killing Lafitte with my hands even if he was innocent She was right,there's no difference Let me when I dropped the bombs I wasn't down there when it hurt somebody Say why So you see Mac you don't need to have to be afraid to tell me if I've murdered an innocent man because it won't be for the first time But this time I can be sure And if I'm sure I can face it So Mac you got to tell me the truth Because I'm the guy that got to live with it Was he innocent,Mac? Then I think I'll get up -Monsieur? -Good morning,Mauricette Monsieur Doumier But you're an American I know do you mind? No,come in -Papa is dead -I know He was taken very ill at the office Yes,I know Is Mama I like to see is she at home? Yes,stay there,Mama,Mama Papa's friend Monsieur Doumier He's an American Monsieur Doumier? But I'm afraid I haven't cleaned the drawing room,what is it you want? I want to speak about your husband About his work in the resistance Resistance? No,of course he never told you That's the hardest thing Not even be able to tell the people we love He was a brave an important agent with us Who did magnificent work for American intelligence and for France You should be proud of him Proud? We are so proud that we like to give you this And please don't you be too proud to take it I know it won't make up for his loss But it will show you that we share it Good bye,Madame Good bye,Mauricette Monsieur Doumier Are you sure that my husband, I mean that he was Quite sure He was a colleague of mine Subtitles by Nostromo
