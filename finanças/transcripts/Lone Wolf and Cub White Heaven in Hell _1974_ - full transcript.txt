With due respect, how did such words reach your ears, my lord? Old man, what's wrong with your Yagyu clan? Haven't you killed Itto Ogami yet? Well... What a disgrace for the Yagyu clan, now serving as Shogunate Executioner. I hear some Shogunate leaders suggest an open attack. An open attack? They'll declare Itto Ogami and his son the worst criminals in the nation and will call on the various lords and magistrates to take action. If this happens, the Yagyu clan will lose face as Shogunate Executioner. My lord, please, not that. My lord, I have a daughter. My youngest, named Kaori. She is more than equal to her brothers in her swordsmanship. Itto has no chance. Itto Ogami will have no chance. We will show you a defeated Itto. Not good enough. Too slow. You still can't defeat Itto Ogami and his Suio-ryu swordsmanship. Next. She juggles her daggers. If he tries to evade the falling one, her other dagger will surprise him. If he tries to block her second dagger, then her first one will get him. Next. Impressive, Uzaki. You saw through my juggling daggers. Keep your two daggers always shifting to match your opponent's moves. Be flexible. Know that the spinning dagger is always above your head. You only need to lure the opponent into its path. I'll make sure you did not die in vain. Forgive me. Kaori. Yes. You and I are the only Ura-Yagyu alive now. You are the last hope for our Yagyu clan. Avenge your dead brothers. Kill Itto Ogami and his son Daigoro. I understand, my lord. Farewell, then. Go now. The Kurokuwa ninjas are led by Ozunu Iwane. He will guide you to Itto. According to my men's reports, Itto Ogami is moving east on Sanyo Road, heading for Kyoto. I see. You may go. Lady Kaori, I will accompany you. I'll go alone. But my men have already cornered Itto. Can your men kill Itto? OFFERING THE WOLF GOES WEST THE WOLF CROSSED TO THE EAST Master Ogami, so good of you to visit her. You've been too kind. Please. Azami. I'm taking Daigoro to Edo now. I'll kill Retsudo Yagyu and restore our Ogami family. THE WOLF CUB IS HERE Daigoro dear? This way! Daigoro dear? Let's go home! Good-bye! Let's juggle, one, two Two, three Three, four Bear some fruits, by the way Juggling cherry blossom Two flowers... Filled with iron filings? Who are you? I'm Kaori Yagyu. My three brothers were killed by you. I'm the last of my Yagyu clan. I'll take the lives of both you and your son, Itto Ogami. You said “three brothers,” which means... I'm Retsudo's daughter. Come on! That mirror cost my brother Kurando his life. If we continue to get closer, we'll fall into her trap. Why? Why did you put your child on your shoulders? You saw through my juggling daggers. You used your own son as a shield. Aren't you his father? Coward. My son and I live the Demon Way in Hell together. We stand ready to descend to Hell through the Six Realms and Four Lives. Lady Kaori... Kaori is dead? Hyoe, are you here? It's Retsudo. Answer me if you are near me. You had three brothers and one sister. They were all defeated by Itto Ogami. You're the only one left. Unless we defeat Itto Ogami, not only the Tokugawa Shogunate, but the entire Ura-Yagyu clan will be the laughingstock of the nation. I have only one son left now. Hyoe, you're the one. Hyoe, now is your time. As the heir to the Ura-Yagyu clan, defeat Itto Ogami. Now is the time for you to claim yourself as my son and step out into the world. Now that all your four Ura-Yagyu children fell before Itto, you want me to call you my father? UNDERGROUND Just to kill Itto, you bothered to come this deep into the mountains? I applaud your hard work. Hyogo, Kurando, Gunbei and Kaori. Your handpicked sword masters have all been defeated. So now you say I, Hyoe, am your last resort. Kill Itto. For the Yagyu clan. Just because I was born to your mistress, I was abandoned here deep in the mountains when I was only five years old. How I longed for my father and my mother. It's a wonder that I survived. Hyoe. Listen now. For me, Hyoe, my parents are the Tsuchigumo “Underground Spider” clan in Mount Kiso Ontake and nobody else. Hyoe. Do you mean it? I am definitely not a Yagyu. I will steal your thunder, Yagyu. Wait. Hyoe. Wait, I said. Eight million gods and deities gather at the river in heaven. To those powerful gods, I humbly pray. These three select brave men have been sent to the nether world, and they have been purified. Now I wish for their return. I pray my petition will be answered. Come out, brave men. Mudo. Muga. Mumon. You three stayed underground for 42 days. After the Tsuchigumo Death Rite, you have been resurrected as violent, immortal souls. You're alive but not alive. You're dead but not dead. The time has come. We're Tsuchigumo. We live for fame as swordsmen. We value the way of the samurai. It's our time to take Yagyu's place and let the nation know our name. Kill Itto Ogami. The Yagyu clan is nothing to us. Death to Lone Wolf and Cub! What a cute boy! Look, this is a whistle. Here. Yummy yum-yum Stretch it, squeeze it, stretch it again It melts softly in your mouth - Give me candy. - Me too. One for you, son. How about a candy for your son? We'll take one. Thank you very much. Thank you, sir. Here, it's delicious. Thank you. Yummy, yum-yum Buy one, buy all Daigoro! Wherever you go, father and son, innocent people will die. Who are you? The songstress, the candy man, and others not associated with you will die. How sad. Wherever you and your son go, innocent people will die. KOMATSU-YA INN I'm sorry for the late hour, but I'd like to stay the night. Sure, sir. Coming. Welcome, sir. You must be tired. I thank you. Sure, sir. O-Matsu, put away their cart. What a cute boy! Let me light up the room. Please come in. Here you go. I'll bring dinner right away. It's not much, but please wait a little. Thank you for waiting. Daigoro! If you and your son ask to stay a night and ask for food, or even ask anything, those people will die. How sad. Wherever you go, father and son, you'll invite bloodshed and massacre, and the winds of carnage will blow. We call this Tsuchigumo Five Wheels. Joy, anger, sorrow, pleasure and fear. The five expressions of human emotion will be annihilated. Tsuchigumo. For you and your son, joy and sorrow, anger and pleasure will be annihilated. Only fear will remain, and you shall tremble. This is our Tsuchigumo Five Wheels. Both of you, father and son, nothing but grim reapers. Step by step, walk down the path of carnage. I have a report for Lord Retsudo. Speak. Master Hyoe is terrifying. He employs a trick never seen before and far superior to our Kurokuwa clan, and he is cornering Itto and his son. What? Hyoe is? It appears even Itto Ogami and his son are beginning to feel fear now. That surly bastard. Lord Retsudo. Shut up, Ozunu. What's with the Kurokuwa men? Hyoe is nothing. Has he scared you away? Hyoe is a Tsuchigumo. With due respect, sir, it is only how he appears. In truth, Lord Retsudo, your blood runs in his veins. He is a true heir to the Yagyu clan. He may be. However, that bastard refused my request. It is because, since he was young, he grew up with birds and beasts. He grew into a man only after living a lonely life in the mountains. The only one to soften his heart may be... Who? None other than Lady Azusa, Master Hyoe's younger sister. Azusa. Ozunu, send her a message at once. Lady Azusa? Please stay as you are and listen. I have a message from your father, Lord Retsudo. Please see to it that Master Hyoe's heart becomes softened. Please do what you can. What's he burying? Daigoro. Cautious bastard. I am the Zeze Domain chief guard, Kyudayu Kenmochi. Assassin Lone Wolf and Cub. It is past the hour agreed with the cairns. I'd like to ask you why you're late. I'm sorry to have troubled you to come. Our circumstances have changed. We'd like to cancel our assassination request. It's not much, but here is 50 ryo for breaching the contract. We have caused you inconvenience. We'd like you to accept it. Tell me the reason. I think it's better for both of us if I don't. Then why did you come? If the client doesn't come, naturally there won't be an assassination request. Because you are Master Itto Ogami, former Shogunate Executioner, we can't treat you like a common assassin. All the more reason to explain why you're canceling, if you value loyalty and faith that much. If you insist, I have no choice. I chose not to say for your own sake. It's the Yagyu. We know your quarrel with the Yagyu. The Ura-Yagyu schemed to obtain the high post of Shogunate Executioner, and you fell into their stratagem. You've become an assassin to clear the false charges. That was all until yesterday. Things have drastically changed now. How? From now on, the Yagyu clan will mount open attacks against you. Such is the report we've received. Open attacks? They'll make a nationwide announcement that you're a dangerous criminal. All the daimyo lords and magistrates will put themselves forward to capture you. Master Ogami, I offer you my boat. Cross the lake to the north shore and cross the mountains to escape. Once I receive the Yagyu notice, I too must pursue you. Will you trust me and accept my offer? I appreciate it. Daigoro. What are you doing? Would a samurai step on his sword, which should be his soul? You stepped on the grip to climb up here. How do you explain that? And you hide your face. Even for the Zeze Domain head guard, this is against samurai etiquette. You're not a samurai. What better proof you're a Tsuchigumo? Well done, Itto Ogami. Impressive how you saw through me. I lied that I was Kyudayu Kenmochi of the Zeze Domain. Hyoe Tsuchigumo at your service. Itto Ogami, the time has come for you to die graciously by the Tsuchigumo sword. What's your answer? Is that your answer? A samurai worries about his honor when he dies. Which is why, when one samurai points his sword at another, he identifies himself and makes the challenge to a fight. I identified myself as Hyoe Tsuchigumo. What a laugh to hear Hyoe Tsuchigumo. Why would a Tsuchigumo come after our lives? Are you under Retsudo Yagyu's orders? Who cares about Retsudo? I hear Retsudo has a son named Hyoe. I also hear he is an illegitimate bastard. Shut up, Itto. Who cares about fathers? Who cares about sons? Hyoe Tsuchigumo will kill you and steal the thunder from Retsudo Yagyu. We'll attain renown, not the Yagyu. The canon of good behavior dictates you must declare your true name to pay proper respect to the dying. Will you be a samurai and fight or be a stray dog and strike in the dark? Must you employ bizarre tricks and ambush us? You fear my Suio-ryu swordsmanship? How about it? Cowardice is what the Tsuchigumo value. What a swordsman you are! What? And the samurai's code for a devil on the Demon Way in Hell? What a laugh! If you claim to be a samurai, however, and wish us to behave as samurai as well, then we shall fight a normal duel. Back off. Draw back. It's a duel, Itto Ogami. Very well. Tsuchigumo-ryu, Hyoe Tsuchigumo. Suio-ryu, Itto Ogami. We must take the place of the Yagyu clan. The nation must know us as true samurai. I abused you to lure you into a fair duel. It's because my son and I must live at any cost. Forgive me. I am destined to die one day. For now, I suffer the torture on the Demon Way in Hell. I know that. I, too, have one regret, and I cannot die yet. Let us part as we are for now. We shall meet again if we live. Agreed. Before my life ends... Brother! What are you doing, Brother? Have my child. That child, my child, will become the Tsuchigumo heir. Azusa! The Yagyu clan and Retsudo shall not rule the country. We the Tsuchigumo won't suffer this shameful suffering, buried in the mountains. Azusa, give birth to my child. Have the Tsuchigumo Commander's son. Brother. It's to show Retsudo I, Hyoe, too, have my pride as a man. Bear my seed. Azusa! Hyoe! Are you insane? We have both fallen to the way of the beast. Please execute us both. Father. What a fool. Hyoe. You could have killed Itto Ogami. And yet - You idiot! A samurai duel? You lost! Get ready, Tsuchigumo clan. I, Retsudo, will take command now. We refuse. What? We must carry out Commander Hyoe's last wishes. We, the Tsuchigumo clan, will kill Itto Ogami ourselves. Pardon. He's lured us into the snow. If he stays here in the snow, we can't use our tricks. It's hopeless. We're freezing. Now! Terrifying is Itto Ogami. The Tsuchigumo Five Wheels is defeated. I wish... when I die, at last... my face changes to show emotion. How sad. How pitiful is the Tsuchigumo Five Wheels. I've been waiting for you too long, Retsudo. Itto Ogami. Because of you, the Yagyu clan lost six children. I'm the only one left. You brought it on yourself. Look at yourself, however. You have a son, Daigoro, and he's still alive. Suffer loneliness until you lose sanity. All our clan's hatred is gathered here for the showdown. Exactly what I wish for. Attack! Daigoro. Daigoro. Lord Retsudo. Attack! Prepare to die! Fool! Now! Lord Retsudo, this is it for now. Please hurry. Itto... He may be Lone Wolf and Cub, but I swear to kill him. Papa. Daigoro. THE END
