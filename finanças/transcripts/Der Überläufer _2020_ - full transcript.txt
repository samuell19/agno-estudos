Stay away from him. No! Hard! Hard! Wolfgang! This is Walter Proska. good comrade. I vouch for him. The guys here are like you and me. We are not traitors. Count me too. You have to prove that you can be trusted. Come out! Believe me, nothing will happen to you! How do you know what the Russians are doing to our people? Now we are Russian too! Is that really you? What about you? I don't know who I am anymore. You believe you are on the right side. There's no right side anymore, Walter. What if we go? Do you have the courage? Walter! You let me down. I vouched for you, remember that. Next time it's my turn. The wolf went ahead. Really? Soviet headquarters in Berlin, October 1945 Comrades, comrades. We will activate central governments in the following areas: Transport... ...post and telecommunications... ...fuel and energy, trade and utilities... ...industry, forestry and agriculture... ...finance, workforce, social welfare, public education and justice. This is an important step for the Soviet-controlled region. In a short time, just a few months after liberation. To our Soviet brothers, something from them... ... we sincerely thank them for allowing us to learn. We will move on and build a socialist state. We need guys like you for this. To those who will fight on our side. Our war continues. We have big plans, comrades! RENEGADE - Honor. - Honor. Proska. I know what you think when you look so sad. Kürschner said. We have to find the little Polish girl or Proska dies... How do you say? - Broken heart. - Broken, broken heart. - Broken heart. - Is the young man infatuated? We're looking everywhere. We will find him. In honor of the good man Proska. Thank you. Looks like the Colonel appreciates you very much. Proska, good guy. You did it, you showed courage. Good man. What are you doing now? I'm distributing the right of way. You are in the right place here. People have to come to terms with those who dragged them into disaster. Industrialists, Prussian aristocrats. They are hiding now. We didn't do everything. A farmer, even if he's a party member... ...what can you blame? Did he have any other options? We must find the rotten apples or there will be no progress. There can be no pause in socialist society. It only happens in the bourgeois world. That is why the bourgeoisie suffers from sphincter spasm. Its... It gives the right of way. Good. Keep your eyes open. Every society has outposts... ... needs breakers, lightning rods, exploration. You are the lightning rod of the new Germany. The watcher of our future. We need them. Proska, don't forget... You need us. Breakwater, lightning rod, lookout. What does he want from me, I just give the right of way. Walter, there are 8.5 million NSDAP members. It makes up 10% of the population. Well? You've only eliminated 3 percent so far. But it must be at least 10. Does the 10 percent matter? People come to you... ... you see their passports, their IDs. Find out what they're doing. Separate the rotten apples. What happens to rotten apples? This is no longer your job. The war ended a long time ago. Don't you remember, don't you want to? I said it three times. We were taken from our home to the city to work in a factory. Now the war is over. i want to go back home That means I need permission, that's why I'm here. I just want to go home. Where is your home? Is there a problem with the question? Wattenscheid. Bochum. There are Brits out there, you know? Do you know what they will do to the country? They'll let him bleed to death. We are building something and you become a part of it. Do you have anything to say against it? No. Or did you do something? No. Everyone did something, right? I did not do anything. What job did you do, for example. In a factory. Which factory exactly? Rheinmetall Borsich'de. for the railroad. Did you have a foreman? - Yeah. - Was he at the party? were you at the party? - No. - Why are you lying? I was not at the party. Never! Come again tomorrow. Thank you. Thank you. We should have pushed a little harder. - There was nothing left to take. - I have a different idea. Bayan Roth. Next please. If you find anything... Even if it was bad, you would have told me, wouldn't you? You mean Wanda? As it stands. He couldn't have just gone. There is no central registry yet. But I will take care of it. We are looking for him. Maybe I'll track it myself. Are you going to Poland? Let them cut off your head after crossing the border? Look ahead, Walter. Do your job. I will find them. His sister too. Good Morning. Good Morning. A beautiful morning. See you later. How much? Do you have a card? I have money. I have. Sorry. Good morning, Mr. Proska. Good Morning. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Where'd you get? I have relatives all over the country... ... a lot of people always come to exchange. If you want something, you have to organize yourself, right? My husband is in the hospital with the Americans. They say they don't have much time. That's why. Was your husband at the party? We are in a hurry. Kalk, Helmut. Thank you. I think her husband was at the party. The letter is two weeks old, do you think it's still alive? Next. You sit. Do you want a right of way? Do you understand me? Do you have a document? Bad luck. Your name? Willhelm Stehauf. Bay stand up. Do you want a right of way? - Where would you like to go? - To Cologne. Are you from there? Do you have family? I have a son. Were you at the party? Yeah. So what did you do? En öndeydim. in the east. Then... in the defense zone. It was destroyed, we did it again. What did you do there? What was your rank? Sergeant. Damn liver. Do you have a light? We all know what we're doing. Everyone did their own thing. Someone like that... ... the other is like this. We should examine your case more closely. Documents and ID card will stay here. Come back next week. Your card. Do you know this man? I will handle it. excuse me I didn't want to bother you this late, so... You didn't. Because you love coffee and I've had enough. Thanks. See you tomorrow. To you... May I offer you a cup of coffee? with pleasure. The flat was given to me, not actually mine. Don't bother. Sorry, I'm not here often. You don't even notice. Coffee. Give it to me. - I'll do it, sit down. - Give me the cover. Al. Ben Hildegard. Hilde. Walter. Just Walter. What about you? Is there anyone else? Yeah. My sister. But I don't know where it is. It's almost as if the trace has disappeared. what happened to her... ...you can not know. Did you call him? Yeah. The problem is what happened to him when I found him. You can't imagine what I've been doing. Even my own sister. And he doesn't even know it. You can tell me. I can't tell this to anyone. Dress... To your sister? No. That's important too, right? Anyway, I have to go. sit down. Enjoy your coffee and jam. Bye bye Walter. Bye. Here you can see the total number of applications. That's the permissions. This is very little and remains so. This is what exists. You heard Menzel. It's about those who got Germany into it. Bu en az% 10'du. If that doesn't work, you're in the wrong place. It can't be that hard! Can I talk to you alone? If you'll excuse us, Comrade Kunkel. Certainly. Born? I want the same as you. It's getting better. A new Germany. But I'm not a police or prosecutor or... ... I'm not the court, neither are you. We wanted it to be different, right? There is neither a group nor an informant anymore. We wanted you to be happy again. Yeah. What happened? My family's house. You said you were bombed. I always thought they would run into bunkers. They cleared the rubble today. They found two bodies in the basement. Two old people. They drowned and no one noticed anything. Good luck. Proska. I finally remembered his name. Get out. I need your help. Do you remember Kowolsky too? The dynamite that never existed. What about everything else? Now it's your turn. First you got rid of the dust of the past, now you will get rid of fat Max? I did something. In the warehouse. I took responsibility. But most of all, I kept my word as an officer. What about you? If you think you're not guilty... Wearing a different uniform... ... it doesn't clear everything. Shut up. I have a son. I want to know if he is alive. Stand up Stop politely. Fall. If you fall, you will be slapped. First a leg, then... You see when someone disobeys. So now again. Last time. If you don't do as I say, you will be punished. Then I'll find another one. Those who refuse to abide by the rules feel the consequences. If you think you're not guilty... Just wearing a different uniform... ... it doesn't clear everything. Good Morning. Good Morning. Have you heard of Hilde's coffee or what drove you here? We talked about numbers, right? Menzel asked me, and I said Walter was a good comrade. He will deliver. And I guarantee it. - Ask Kunkel. - I asked. In the drawer. Job done. The way you talk, you know what's inside. Unlock the drawer. Kunkel. Why Stehauf? Is it because he's your friend? I wanted to think about it. What's there to think about what he's done? I also did something. How can we judge him? Because we are building the new Germany. And a pig like Stehauf wouldn't get away with it. Where is it registered? This is missing. I know. There are two in every room here. Do you think I don't notice? Why are you letting Kunkel follow me? Where does she lives? What will happen to him? Do you know why I came here this morning? Every good deed costs something. When we ask the Russians... ... they expect a response from us. Yet I kneel before Menzel, why? Because Menzel trusted me... ...does a lot of good and asks. He also gets an answer to what he asked. Wanda? Wanda. Is he alive? Yeah. Where is he? Where does he live? Hard! Gel! He will be taken to Hohenschönhausen. At least he'll have a roof over his head. Where is Wanda? Still in Poland. They're displacing half a million people. From Ukraine, Lithuania... You have no idea. But we found it. Can you thank Menzel? It will take a little longer but things are going well. Continue. Thanks. - Good morning. - Good morning. You should tell him and apologize. - He took it for himself. - You are not idle. The revolution wants us... Go take your revolution. Tell him. Who do you think you are? There is no connection with the woman you are looking for in Poland. No one asked him, and no one will. I need a car. To where? Hohenschönhausen'e. Kürschner and Kunkel may have been dishonest. But Walter, this will no longer help. Maybe life doesn't always have to bring something. He got himself into it, and so did you. Please connect to Comrade Kürschner. I have to get someone to question it. - İsim? - Stehauf, Willhelm. - Calm down. - Not again! Please! Calm down. - Not anymore, please. - I'll get you out of here. Its? Come on. Come here. Where are you taking me in your new Germany? Be quiet. In other words, I am not guilty at all. Pick yourself up and walk by my side as normal. - Run! - What? Run! Run! Get out of my way. What happened to you? Haven't we experienced all of this before and resisted? Do you know why there is no progress in monkeys? Because they can't perform hygiene. Look ahead, Walter. History cannot be erased this way. It's not hygienic, it's self-deception. You do not understand. - Don't you want to lock me up? - Be quiet! You are very angry. Go home. Walter. What are you doing here? They are looking for you. You are not allowed to go to the office and return to your apartment. They're waiting for you, I saw them. - Are you sure? - Definitely. No one has more rights than you, Walter. counter-revolutionary... I have to justify myself for the activities tomorrow. We should go. Everything you need is here. It's better for everyone to go alone first. I drew everything. We'll meet then. Walter. Continue here. - Shall I take your backpack? - I'm fine. The process is always the same. Now they pass, then the car comes. This is our moment. Right now. We are safe when we cross the border. But there is no fence. They can bring us back, right? They can't. This is British territory. While we're there, nothing more can happen to us. We'll go there when it gets dark. Alright. The woman you're looking for is Polish, isn't she? Yeah. I heard there is a camp near Hamburg. There are Poles. - What if he joined the army... - He's not there. I know you love him. Maybe you will always love him. But it's not there. I'm here Walter. - I'll take your backpack. - It's not that heavy. - Come on... - I'll scream if you touch it. Now. Hamburg, May, 1956 Klaus and Angelika, come in? But we want to play. I want you to come inside too. Number one, number two. march march. You will play tomorrow. Say good evening before going to bed. I'll be disappointed if you don't. Klaus. Angelica. - Good evening, Mr. Ludeke. - Good evening. - Good evening, Mr. Ludeke. - Good evening. - Good evening, Miss Ludeke. - Good evening, Angelica. Very good. Now to bed. Al. Good evening ladies and gentlemen... We are on the screen of Norddeutscher Rundfunk's studio and your homes. - Walter, are you coming? Starting. - Come on. - Today again with music... - We need a drink! What's the problem there? Has anyone won the lottery? He doesn't look at anything but himself. Thank you. Because we deserve it. - Cheers. - Good start. I missed Freddy Quinn because of the champagne. Nothing builds bridges like music does. Nothing moves us faster and deeper than music. ... somehow it cannot connect across borders. The rifts in our past separate us from our neighbors. - But the music... - It's always about the past. It was bad enough. You don't have to ride. I also don't know what it's for. You have to free yourself from this and look to the future. Polish folk songs are now being sung on our television. So I'm going to turn the volume down. Walter? excuse me. Walter? Please do not go. Translation: Palindrome (Yunus Ari)
