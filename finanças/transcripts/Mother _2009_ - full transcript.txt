Say hi to Mom. Attention! Salute! Eyes front! What the fuck! - Fuck! - Do-jun! Benz, you fuckers! - Fuck! - Are you okay? Are you all right? - No, blood! - Shit, don't! - Do-jun, you're bleeding! Look! - Do-jun! - Shit, Mom. Get back in there! - Where are you hurt? - Ma'am! - You're bleeding! Ma'am! - Wait! - Hurry! - Your hand! - Do-jun! - He's bleeding. - Oh no. I knew it. It's you who's bleeding. To the golf course, the Royal Palace Country Club. - Is it where they went? - You punk. Where else would a Benz go in this town? Sir, is it a hit-and-run? They slammed on the gas after hitting him. They deserve to have their faces slammed. Oh no! It's blood! - Blood! - Okay. 5-3-6-2. 5-3-6-2, a white Benz. 5-2-9-3, you prick. A black Benz. Right, it was black. A black one. How can't you tell white apart from black? Well, for you, it's possible because you're freaking weird. Over there! That's the one right there. It must hurt. Follow me. Geez. My hips. Finish it already. Goodness. Quiet. What are you, a doctor? Don't move your finger. What are you doing? Oh my. Gosh, it's frustrating. Where would he go? This is a golf course. That's right. You don't remember why we're here, do you? Wow, look! Yay! I have two now. I wonder why she adores you so much. I mean your mom. Right, my mom. The car was like vroom and crash! My blood squirted. We're here for revenge. That's right. For revenge. Gosh. By the way, where are the Benz fuckers now? It's about time they'd pass by. Look! There are so many. What are you going to do with them? I'll give them to a girl. Do you even have a girl to give to? Have you slept with a girl? What a pathetic asshole. You with your pretty face. I slept with a woman. With whom? With Mom. Where the fuck are they? Come on out. They're here! - Revenge! - Come out! What's he doing? - What's with him? - No. What are you looking at, you motherfuckers? - Stop, Benz! - What's wrong? Stop! What's with you? Who the heck are you? - No! - What's wrong? What's wrong with you? Hey, you sons of bitches! What's going on? - What's with you? - Who drove your car? You ran over someone! Who was the driver? Was it you? - Was it you? - Hey, don't! - You assholes! - What's with you? Gosh, who are you now? - What's with you? - Were you the driver? You punk, what are you doing? Come on! What the fuck? You're not going anywhere! Come here, you asshole. Excuse me. He's too important to be here. So I suggest you should settle the matter amicably. For respected professors like yourselves, it'd look bad to involve in a hit-and-run. And they are not criminals. They're local kids with no job. So let's just settle things right here, okay? The hit-and-run and the assault should cancel each other out. And no racketeering. DO-JUN Mr. Dean, what about your car? They smashed my rear-view mirror in the parking lot. A Benz 280. Damn it. Come on. What did you do that for? Gosh, that's going to cost quite a lot. You bet. Damn it. - Why did I do that? - Hey. Do you know how much it'd cost, dumbass? "Dumbass"? - No! - Hey! - What are you doing? - Let him go! Come on! - You punk! - Unbelievable! Let me go! How dare you, you prick! - Sir, sit down. - Punk! I can't believe this guy. So a Benz's mirror... - Get off me! - ...would be pretty... - Expensive. - Fucker. - Don't move. - 1.5 million won? - Sit down. - Two million? Good, here she comes. Hello. Have this one. - No. - Please try it. After you are held at a government office like a police station, you need to eat something good for your health. Darn it. I know how to eat. I boiled this with deodeok and goji berries. It's good for your stamina too. My stamina? Really? What do you need stamina for? For a girl. Are you seeing someone? Yes, and I need to sleep with her. Don't do that. Who is she? I must sleep with a girl. Gosh. Do you know what car you messed up with? It's a Benz. The mirror is very expensive. Smash! I kicked it. It was revenge. Good for you. But I don't have money. Where should I dig up to find the money? Where should I go and dig up? Why would you want to do that? It's hard. - Borrow it from Jin-tae. - Jin... Don't hang out with him. He's bad to the core. He was born from a bad seed. Okay. - Where are you going? - To meet Jin-tae. Finish your meal first... At least take your medicine. It's important not to skip it. Do-jun, you haven't finished it. Come home early! Don't be late. It doesn't hurt, right? No, it doesn't. I'll make sure it doesn't, and I won't charge you for this either, so lend me some money instead. How much? I need it urgently. I'll make you medicine instead of interest. - Medicine? - That's right. For your fertility. With most effective ingredients. Is there such medicine like that? It works like magic. I had my Do-jun after taking it. You'd have a handsome boy too. Do-jun has the eyes that are like a work of art. They're like a deer's. Like mine? Right. His eyes are just like yours. So beautiful. So my conclusion is you look sexier these days. - And... - Whatever. Why isn't Jin-tae here yet? Isn't he? He'd be here by now. You kept saying that for hours. Forget it. - Geez. - Darn. You're treating me like nothing. You know what? I just came back from the police station. Have some respect. Jin-tae, where the heck are you? Why aren't you here yet? Gosh. Go to sleep, Mom. Shit! I'm going to be late, so just go to sleep, Mom! Wake up. Wake up now. Do something. Hey, did you have a good sleep? Wipe the spit off your face. What a pathetic fucking loser. Hey, call your mom to come! Tell her to pay your bill! - What a pain in the ass. - Do-jun! I told you to use the backstairs. Mi-na. How have you been? Hi, Mi-na. How about a drink with me? - Really? - Yes. Hey, turn left. - Go forward. - Call me. - Move now. - It hurts. Okay, I'm going. Quiet. Go upstairs and study. You have a pretty skirt. Hey. Turn around. And even prettier legs. Who are you making a pass at? Get out of here. MANHATTAN I'm begging you to get lost, please! Wait. Let me pay for my drinks with these. They're expensive. Hey, kid. Hey, kid. Where are you headed? What about you and me drinking together? No? Because I'm a man? You don't like a man? Come on, why are you so late... So, what's her name again? - A-jeong? - It's Mun A-jeong. A sophomore from Seorin Girls' High School, Class 4. Has her family been notified? - Does she have parents? - Actually, no. She only has her grandma with severe dementia. She's always walking around with a bottle of makgeolli absent-mindedly. - Then this kid was her guardian. - Right. - She took care of her grandma. - Correct. By the way, how long has it been since we had homicide here? It's the first one since I got here. It's been ages, then. I guess so. The scene seems very well preserved. Right? Isn't it a sight to see? Even officers these days binge-watch a TV show like CSI, so the forensics guys are pretty sharp too. - We had heavy rain this morning. - Yes. Then most of the evidence must've been destroyed. That's true. But it must've been a blunt instrument based on her fractured skull and lots of blood. What's with this? Did they come last week? It smells like... Well, actually... It smells like a rotting corpse. Oh no. I can't believe this. Look. Can't you see this? Gosh, look at this funny color. They look like they're from China. - Boss, they are indeed from China. - Hey! You talk too much. Don't ever mention China... Besides, Chinese imports are not that bad. Hey, come with me. Hey. You still perform acupuncture without a license? What? Me? No way! My husband is a public official, - so you know we can be in big trouble? - Of course, I do. He's going to get a promotion, so let's not cause any problem. Hey, punk. It was really hard to take care of the trouble you caused last year. And it wouldn't be only you next time. My family would be in hot water too. - Pay attention when I talk. - Come on! - Mom! - Repeating myself over... - Hey! - Do-jun! - What's going on? - Do-jun! Oh no, Do-jun! Hey! No! Do-jun! Do-jun! Mom! Get down. Get down. That lady is something. She's a pretty good runner. Do-jun, you're under arrest for murdering Mun A-jeong. You have the right to remain silent. You need a fortune to afford a lawyer. - Do-jun! - There she is. She's got no money. You don't know how to drive, idiot? - Geez, I did hit on the gas. - Aren't you hurt? - Turn your head. - Are you okay? Is your head okay? Please turn your head. What's that? Jae-moon, what's this for? - A dog? - A dog. - A wolf? - A dog. Wow, it's hot in here, isn't it? It's always hot in here. Man to man, let's take off clothes. Take off your pants too. - My pants? - Go ahead. It's okay. It's not like I'm abusing my authority. Okay? Because I'm taking off mine too. It's cooler this way. By the way, Do-jun, you know Sepak takraw, don't you? No. You don't care because it's fucking unpopular? Asshole. Bite this. Come here and bite it. Good. Come here. Turn around. This is the punishment. Good. Attention. Close your eyes. Don't move, or you'll get hurt. Bite it down! Did you see it? Of course, you didn't. This is the power of Sepak takraw. Got it? This is one of the basic moves. Do like this and that. Bam! Hey, from now, if you don't answer loud and clear, you're dead meat. Got it? I'll be watching you. Do-jun! What did you do last night? Spit out the apple. What did you do? - I drank and... - Where? At Manhattan. Good. Then what? I slept at home. Yes, you should sleep. But before that, I mean after drinking at home, no, at Manhattan, what did you do on your way home? Manhattan's owner told me you were as horny as hell. What's the name of her daughter? - Mi-na. - That's right, Mi-na. A repeat examinee. You were hitting on her, right? Well... - I mean... - A clear answer, asshole! I slept at home with Mom. - So simple. - Do you sleep with your mom? You don't need to answer that. You said you don't remember a thing, but many are saying stuff against you, okay? There's a man who saw you while feeding his dog. He said you were following A-jeong toward the crime scene. Were you, or were you not? I don't remember. You got a fucking death wish? We have many apples for you. - Open your mouth. - Never mind that. Well, near the body, we found something like this. DO-JUN Why didn't you set up a monument next to her body with your name engraved? - Don't laugh. - Do-jun. Let's forget the formalities. Why did you do it? I'm personally curious. Was it because you wanted to do her? Was it? We need to know why so that we can decide to extenuate... So that we can help you in your favor. He's doing this to help you. Do-jun. Frankly speaking, you're not the type of person who can kill someone. Not everyone is capable of murder. But why? You've never been a bad kid. I'm bad in my own way! Oh boy. What should I do with you? He's right. Everyone is capable of murder. It doesn't require a license. Well, we haven't got the motive. But it's true you killed her, right? Well... I... What's important here is that he did it, and he admitted to his crime. INTERROGATION DOSSIERS We've written up a summary of what happened. Please check it over. Well, you can read, can't you? Shall I read it to you? I can read. Good. You know, make sure to sign with your fingerprint after reading it. All right? Check everything over before you do. Okay? Read it carefully. Why did you sign it? Why did you? Did they hit you? They beat you up badly, right? Where did they hit you? Where? Tell me. - An apple. - What? What do I do? Do-jun. You need to get it together at a time like this. Pull yourself together. Let's take a deep breath. Do-jun. Everyone said I killed her. Do as I do. And that makes the sin go around a few times - and come back to me. - What? Did you really sign the paper? Why? Why did you do it? Even if you killed her, you should've kept denying it. If I did, I should say so. Did you? Are you crazy? Of course not. Then why, you idiot? Don't call your son an idiot! - Jae-moon. - Holy crap. How can you do this of all people? You know my son, Do-jun, can't even hurt a water bug. Darn. I'm sick of hearing about that bug. Wipe your face first. Jae-moon. I got some ginseng for you. You ate this a lot back in high school, saying it makes your head clearer. Well, - take it. - Ma'am. Tomorrow at dawn, I have to go to the robbery scene in Juhwang County. And a kid name Jong-pal escaped from the oratory on Mt. Dogye. - I need to go help with that too, and... - Yes. I know. I know you're a busy man. - So... - So what I mean is... Gosh. Do-jun's case is now completely closed. All right? Do you understand? It's over. Period. MUN A-JEONG Did you have some fun last night? Dirty bastard. I went home early. - Move aside. - Excuse me! Hey, out of the way! Out of the way! Put it right here. Goodness! What are you doing? What did you put in here? Well, this is... Hey, put it down right there. Got it? Turn it over. Hey, what are you doing? What the heck are you doing? Put it down here. No, mister! Don't touch it. Well, -I'm not a family, -Okay. but we're very close. Sir, please. Can you say briefly why you think he's innocent? If you read this thoroughly, you'll learn about the golf ball. This information was on a paper. But this? "Human rights abuse with apple-biting"? Mister, read it first before you throw it out. Please read carefully before you throw it away. He's my son... She must be crazy. Why is she here? Who is she? Yun Do-jun's mom. Goodness. How dare you come here? Are you out of your mind? Well, actually, I'm here to offer my condolence as a member of the community. Offer your condolence? On your son's behalf? That won't solve anything! To tell you the truth, my son has nothing to do with it. Everyone here shouldn't be confused although the whole world seems to be ignorant. My son didn't do it! - You're one crazy bitch! - Bitch! How dare you show your filthy face here? Get me some salt! I'm here to tell you that my son didn't do it. - Be reasonable! - Liar! It's your son, Yun Do-jun, who did it! - Murderer! - Bring A-jeong back! - Bring her back to life, bitch! - Let go of me! How dare you come here? - I can't believe this! - Hey! Bring her back to life! - It's misunderstanding! - Misunderstanding, my ass! - Misunderstanding? - Come here! - Get her out of here! - Let me go and talk! - Let her go! - Talk? Let's teach her a lesson! - Let's go, bitch! - Cut it out! - You're not getting away! - Shut up, fuckers! What's this damn racket? Fucking bitches. Get back! You gave birth to a damn motherfucker. He's goddamn son of a bitch! - Don't you hate my son! - What? I won't allow my son to be hated. Why do you hate him? You and your fucking mouth. I will rip them up! Don't you dare hate my son, or I'll make you regret... This place has the best seafood. You're so knowledgeable. That's true. Sir, why don't we sit here? I never sit at a buffet restaurant. Don't run! I keep piling foods on a plate and keep eating. I see. Because you're a busy man. It can help save time. His name is Mr. Gong Seok-ho. He's a lawyer. Greet him politely. Do-jun. Tuck your shirt in, will you? Good. The other part too. This outfit looks better this way. I see. How are you doing? Is it okay to stay here? Yes. The foods here are delicious. - I like prison food. - Shush. Prison food is for the guilty. Do-jun, what's important here is whatever you can remember that night, however insignificant they are, you need to tell Mr. Gong every single detail. Do you understand? Whatever you saw and heard and even smelled that night, you must tell him everything. You got to go all out to remember what happened that night. That's all you have to do in here. Right? Sure. Yeah, do that too. Is this some kind of exercise? No. It's called "The Cursed Temples." Growing up, whenever he did that, it helped him remember things better. - Really? - Yes. So it's a sort of... How do I put it? It's a sort of acupressure. I remember. What is it? I didn't do it. It wasn't me. That's right, Son. Obviously, you didn't kill her. No. That's not what I mean. I mean I didn't smash that rear-view mirror. The one on the Benz. It was Jin-tae! Darn it. Jin-tae smashed the mirror. I'm like, "Thud," but Jin-tae is like, "Crack." Darn it. Sir. What he means is... It's a long story. - Should I explain to you? - Hold on. My office wants me back urgently. - I'd better get going. - What about us? It was a very satisfying first talk. - Then should I call... - No, I will call you. - Move. - When will you call me? - Bye. - When will... No. 6121 visitor, please come to Visiting Room 3. What? Did he leave already? Oh no! He probably doesn't like us. No, he's just busy. He's the best lawyer in this county. Shit. What if I left something out? I should've told him everything. So why the hell did you bring up the mirror thing? Anyway, are you sure it was Jin-tae? Yes. I knew it. That goddamn scumbag. He didn't visit me once. Wait, Do-jun, on the night of the murder, you went out to meet him, right? - Right. - But you couldn't. And as for the golf ball, he's known about it all along. Right? Hello, excuse me. I'm here to see Mr. Gong, the lawyer. He's not in. His car is parked outside. I'm telling you he's not here. You're lying. Mr. Gong! - Sir! - What brings you here? Excuse me. - Ms. Kim, green tea. - I need to discuss something! Geez. What's with you? He was right here. Or do you prefer coffee? As for your case, we're slowly and systematically proceeding with it. Okay? This is for you. I understand you want things to be dealt with quickly, but what can I say? You need to be patient with us. - Okay? - Okay. But Jin-tae is my son's friend, - so talk to him right away. - Ma'am. Let me be straight with you. What we are charging you would only cover an assault involving two broken teeth if we were in Seoul. It's like we're doing volunteer work for you. Geez. I know you're not a lawyer and all that, but you should know that much. This is Jin-tae's place. I'm not available right now, so leave a voice message. If you want to ask about fishing equipment or bait, you can reach me at 010-3154-1406. Asshole. KOREA'S FORENSICS INVESTIGATION FILES Blood! Where is the book? Here it is. Stop. I said stop. - Wait. Let me read this first. - Let me take this off first. Please cooperate. - Good. - Give me a minute. Okay. Read. Good. There you go. What's wrong with you? I'm at the climax! H... Hot dog. Gucci. Idiot. - Titan. - Nugget. Toa... toast. Where is Jae-moon? - Detective Nam Jae-moon. - What's this about? Go away. No, this one. You got it with your academy fee? No. Do I look pretty? - She's wearing it too much. - Isn't she - a daughter of Manhattan's lady? - Yes. Kiss. - Very pretty. - Look. Is this how you date? On the cheek. Lucky bastard. Here, right here. Look. - Look! - Yeah, the lipstick was transferred then. Yeah, the red one. Do you play golf? Hell no. The professors from that incident gave it to me. - Sir. - Yes? Do we need the forensics team for this? Anybody can tell it's just dried lipstick smudge. Okay. Tell them not to bother. PROTECT PUBLIC WELFARE AND SERVE WITH KINDNESS Ma'am! Take this umbrella, please. Ma'am. Excuse me. Look at you. I went to the station to pick you up. Get in. Mr. Gong wants to see you. Hi, ma'am. Good to see you here. Well, we had an early start. Why don't you wait outside? Come. Have a seat. You had a rough day today. I heard all about it from the lead investigator, and I am heartbroken for you. It's the first time to see you sitting. You're as witty as I expected. Give this to her. Ma'am, do you remember the 2002 FIFA World Cup Korea/Japan? The Red Devils. Guus Hiddink. But four years passed quickly after that. With our hearts still burning with joy, we were already in the year 2006. The 2006 FIFA World Cup Germany began. Four years can pass in a blink of an eye like that. What are you trying to say? For Do-jun's sake, let's settle with a four-year sentence. He can stay at a hospital, so it's way better than 15 years in jail. Ma'am. You got to think realistically. In a situation like this, it's like hitting a legal jackpot if he is detained in a mental hospital! Honey, a good speech! Ma'am. Let me introduce these. This on my right is my classmate of Yongcheon High School and the director of Agape Psychiatric Hospital, Doctor Yun Jong-gu. Girls, wake him up. And this guy is my classmate of the same institute of legal training. He's Prosecutor Park Jong-pyo. A handsome guy. What's that? Holding a protest? Wake him up. - Honey. - You're wasted only with a few drinks? Don't. Honey, you're naughty. You guys are ruining today's... Excuse me, but my son is... See, we still got plenty of alcohol left. Look! Hey, look! Don't worry. BACCHUS Do-jun! Why are you late? You're reeking of alcohol. It's late. Why... Have you eaten? What? I wonder if you had dinner or not. Thank you for your concern. But I have a fucking bone to pick with you. How could you do that to me, bitch? Jin-tae, what I did was unforgivable. Whatever. Give me five million won as compensation. In cash. Currently, I have not much. Let me see. This is what I've been saving to pay off my debt. It's all I have. Take this for now. Okay. Wire the rest to my account. I'll text you the number. You know how to text, right? Ma'am. You know what? The dead girl, Mun A-jeong. Do you know anything about her? There was a rumor about her. Well, I feel bad to speak ill of the deceased. But the rumor was somewhat... Ma'am. When it comes to murder, it involves three factors. Money, love affair, and revenge. Look. In this case, she was a poor high school student, so it wasn't about money, right? Therefore, it was about either love affair or revenge. That's about it. So the cops should've looked into her relationships first. But they're closing the case based on Do-jun's golf ball. The fucking cops did absolutely nothing. Exactly. Do-jun is the most convenient scapegoat. That's not how I'd conduct the investigation. I'm sorry. I didn't know you care this much. Of course, I do. Do-jun is in big shit, and I'm his friend. Thank you, Jin-tae. Don't cry. It's not the fucking time to cry. Enough. Ma'am, you know what's the weirdest of all? The rooftop. The body was on the rooftop. I mean A-jeong's body. A body is usually buried. However, her body was carried all the way up there. It's like putting out her body on a display as if she were laundry. "Look, everyone." "I killed this fucking bitch." "Can you see her?" Something like that. Look around. The body was on the spot where the whole town could see. This town itself is a bit bizarre. So ma'am, don't trust anybody. You need no one. Don't even trust me. Find the real perp on your own. Do-jun. I'm sure you try hard to recall what happened that night. No matter what you remember or recall, you must tell no one but me. Okay? No one but me. Do you understand? How about that guy? The lawyer? I fired that douchebag. You printed out her photo for the funeral? I mean Mun A-jeong's. MURDER REENACTMENT FUELS ANGER She was such a pretty girl. That's why they say a beauty has unfortunate life. It's "A beauty has short life." That's why she died so young. Her mother died young too, and her father ran off with another woman. Even her relatives are a bunch of jerks. So this little girl got by on her own. - She must've been damn lonely. - Who are you talking about? I heard A-jeong had a lover. Who? Jong-pal. From the oratory? Bullshit. That's nonsense. That prick, Jong-pal, is damn ugly. I'm telling you. I heard that A-jeong was such a slut. She couldn't even sleep alone. They're just rumors. I heard her nickname was Rice Cake Girl. Rice Cake? She only ate tteokbokki? She must've eaten eomuk as well. Do you have anything else that crosses your mind? I only remember seeing her from the back. She had a backpack. And her white legs. Are you sure she was alone? No one else was around? I'm sure. So you're sure you didn't see anybody else on the way from Manhattan. Right? See that kid? Go to him, and call him a dumbass. Then what? It'll crack you up. It'll be funny as hell. Go on. Try it. What if it won't? Just give it a shot. Dumbass. You dumbass! What the fuck? I feel like I'm an idiot. Here he comes! What has happened to you? Were you in a... I told you to do nothing but to think. That's what I did, damn it! Keep your voice down. You don't know a shit. You're right. I don't know anything. What would I know? Shit, then don't grill me. You told me to kick their ass if anybody insults me. Yes, if you're insulted... - Kick their ass. - If you're hit once... - Hit them twice. - Yes. By the way, you must be in pain. Did you take a painkiller? Did they give you any? You know... It was interesting. What do you mean? Getting beaten up helps me remember. I started to recall things. What do you recall? Something important. Like what? Like you were trying to kill me. When I was five, right? To kill me, you put pesticide in my beverage, Bacchus. Do-jun. Oh boy. Are you okay? Darn it. You're embarrassing me. What? Everybody is watching us. How can you remember that? I am right, though. You wanted to get rid of me by killing me. Kill you? Life was too hard on me, so I tried to kill both of us. You poisoned me first - with the pesticide in Bacchus. - Be quiet! I gave it to you first, then I was going to follow you. Ma'am. Let's step outside. I was in such despair, and you and I are one. We are all we got in this world. Oh no! Hey, come in quickly! But you were five. How could you remember that? Ma'am, you can't. Let me give you acupuncture. There's an acupuncture point that can help erase all those horrible memories and untie the knots in your heart. Put your thigh up against here. I'm the only who knows about it. Look. Five inches up from the knee, - and three inches... - Ma'am! Jong-do. You saw how sick my son is. Please close your eyes to this. Why? You'll kill me with the needles now? Hey, what are you doing? Take him out now. Don't ever come to see me again. I won't see you even if you do. Can you enlarge this and print it out clearly? Back then, for pesticide, I should've used Gramoxone. Then he and I would have had a blast in the flower garden in heaven without suffering like this. I didn't have the guts, so I used Lone Star, which is mild. So instead of dying, we kept vomiting and having diarrhea for two days. But after that, I've fed him all the good stuff in the world. Do-jun was the most adorable at this age. He's still adorable. Yes, in this photo, he is as cute as a button. - It makes you want to have a baby, right? - Yes. You will soon. - You're taking the medicine I made, right? - Of course. This is amazing. Nothing is impossible these days, I guess. This is nothing but just basics. "Nothing but just basics..." Wow, you are good. It's perfectly gone. That's just basics. These look good. You like them? I wish I'd look like this in a mirror too. By the way, I wonder how much it would cost to print cellphone's photos. Maybe 20 of them? I have to look. Why do you want to have them printed? The quality won't be good. Well, just to remember by? Shit. Here, tissues. Oh my. Why does it happen all the time? I told you to go see a doctor. No way. It costs me money. Right. The girl whose nose was bleeding was Mun A-jeong. Why did she want her phone's photos... Those photos are amazing in their own way. Ma'am! You have plenty of rice, and the water works well. But your phone line is dead. Do you have a cellphone? Why? You want to buy me one? VOLUNTEER FOR THE SINGLE ELDERLY Just give me money instead. You do have a cellphone, don't you? I don't know. Ask A-jeong. That rotten brat left home and never came back. MUN A-JEONG I got a call. How annoying. Really? That's why... Unbelievable. - You're right. - Oh my, look. That poop is spinning. Where can I get one of those?
