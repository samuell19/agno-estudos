No. Well, you know, he grew up in the country, right? Well, I think he was about 19 when he realized that he'd never even had a girlfriend or left town.

They took everything he owned... rushed him to hospital. Mum, why are you telling me this? Because he was so very angry at the world and felt lost too... But what you don't know is that while he was recovering in hospital, that's where he met your Nan. The love of his life. What I am trying to say is that the world can feel cruel and you can feel lost, but you just have to believe the universe is working its magic every second even if you can't see it. Just trust you are on the right path, okay? Yeah, this path just feels lonely. And weird things keep happening. 'Course it's gonna feel a little weird. It's your first tour.

Where have you been? - Sorry to interrupt. - That's okay. Um, Ellie, you are expected to be on in about seven minutes, so we probably should start your makeup. Yeah, I'll just skip makeup tonight, thanks. It's fine. She's fine. It's okay. Okay, well, we'll see you out there shortly then. If there's anything I can do to be of assistance, you just let me know. Thank you. Thank you very much. - Thank you. - Okay. We'll continue this conversation later. Please.

[gentle piano music] [music turns energetic] ♪ [audience applauding] [Ellie sniffing] What the hell do you think you are doing? Doing drugs in a public place like this? Ellie, you really don't give a shit, do you? What? This is the last show. Here I am putting myself on the line for you and you're just gonna throw it all over my face? Oh, fuck off. You're not doing this for me. You are doing this for you. This is work. - Remember? - Oh, yes, it is Ellie. And you can be extremely grateful to have got this work. - Grateful? Really? - Yes. You're not grateful for shit. You don't care about anyone but yourself. You don't pay any attention to the real world. You're just stuck in that little phone of yours. So, I don't care, huh? I guess you do then. All you care about is running off with that little friend of yours, this friend that no one has ever even seen, Ellie. At least he wants to spend time with me. At least he shows me some type of love. Oh, my God. So, he loves you. Does he? Hmm? I guess that's why you're sitting here alone doing drugs in a public place like a bum. A fucking bum? Yeah. You know what? It's people like you that fuck with us, you treat us like shit, you kick us while we're down and then you wonder why we act out. [Tee] What the hell are you talking about? You know exactly what I'm talking about. It's people like you that drip evil into this world. So why do you think I wanna spend all my time with Liam? He gets it. He gets me. I am not evil, Ellie. He is. Look at yourself. Look at you. You think because what? He gives you a good time or he gets you hooked on this shit that he loves you? Wake up. It's my life. Who gives a shit? It's your second shot at life. Your mum told me. I know everything. Look... I came over here with some good news. My boss wants to offer you the big show. Tell your boss he can go get fucked. You can think about it. [Liam] Ell, look at me. You need to forget about it. You finished your shows. Let's celebrate. I'm done celebrating. You're done? I just want my music. Hmm. Yeah, well. I don't wanna do it. [Liam] Let's just party. We'll have fun. I don't wanna do it, I just said I don't wanna do it, okay? I don't wanna do it. [Liam] Don't leave me hanging here. Okay? Come on. I'm ready to go, I've been waiting for you, all right? Can you just listen to what I'm saying? I don't wanna do this anymore. I don't feel like doing this anymore. - You'll feel fine. Just... - I don't wanna do it. - Come on. Just have a light. - Get it out of my face. - Have a light. - Get the plate out of my face. This is what you wanted. Wasn't it? Yeah? This is what you fucking wanted, isn't it? I can't do this. I can't do this. Jesus, no. Ell? [Tee] So, have you changed your mind? Yeah, I'm sorry about what I said. I didn't mean any of that. Me too. Look, I really don't wanna see you go down that path, Ell. Yeah. Look, after we spoke, I went up to my room and I thought it through... and I was about to. I was gonna do it again... but I didn't. I couldn't. [laughs] 'Cause I'm here for mum... and I promised that our lives will change after this and I need to make sure that it happens, yeah? Okay, great. I'm glad to hear it. Are we gonna go ahead with the next show? Yeah, let's do it. And let your mum know that I'll have some tickets for her, okay? I want her to be there. Mum, I got the show. Yeah, it's next weekend. Yeah, I'm happy. I guess this is the way the story goes. Of course. [laughs] I'm not gonna play without you there.

Yeah... it'll be fun. What's wrong though? Nothing. Ellie, you can tell me. It's nothing. I've just been feeling really out of place. Oh, well, I get that. I mean, these people are fancy that... No, I mean, in society and life. Society? I just feel like no one cares. Everyone's out for themselves. Oh, hun. That's not true. There are so many people gathered out there - waiting to hear... - I know that. It's fine. I just feel... disconnected. It's fine. Are you still having those, um... those visions you told me about? Um... I'll have to talk to you about something, um... when you told me that you were seeing those things, I, um... I was really worried and I thought it was the medication... but then I started looking into where your heart came from and... Why? Because if something was wrong, I felt like I had the right to know. That's not up to you. Your heart came from a young homeless man. - Homeless? - Not just any homeless man, - but this young man who... - That's not up to you to do. Used to play the keyboard every morning on my way to work. - Why did you do that? - I gave him money every morning, I think this is karma. - I think... - Can you stop talking? He saved your life, honey. [Ellie laughing] He saved my life. So, then here I am getting all this money, money that he needed. - [Susan] What? No. - Money he deserved. All this time I thought I was playing music. It's just him. [Susan] That's not what I'm saying. He should be playing here tonight, not me. What? - [Ellie] I should be dead. - No, Ell, no. I need you to get out. - [Susan] Ell? - Can you please get out? - Mum, can you get out! - [Susan] Okay. Okay. Hope everyone enjoys the show.
