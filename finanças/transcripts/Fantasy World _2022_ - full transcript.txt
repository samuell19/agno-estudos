Excuse me. Check your phone. I kept calling you. A victim needs to give a statement. But I couldn't find a lawyer. - I thought you were in trouble. - Go get ready. Okay Excuse me, you are? Investigation unit, I'm here for the case. Investigation unit? Did you write this social worker report? Yes. The defendant's name is "Zhe Di"? Is "Zhe" even a surname? It's his pseudonym for the cram school. Any injury evaluation or other evidence? It's all her interview report. I've made very detailed notes. It won't do. It's not an official police statement. These are inadmissible in court. That may be the case at the moment, but she can testify at trial. Zhang Zheng-xu. Ms. Guo, when your teacher did those things to you, was there anybody outside the office? Shouldn't we do this in a separate room? Did you call for help? Did you fight back? - Shi-qi, we don't have to... - We're leaving That's enough for today, let's go. Come on. Let's go for now. It's all right. Thank you, officer. Mr. Big Shot lawyer, we need a real statement to do our job. Who says the victim must fight back for it to be a crime? It happened in a cram school, if she cried for help, she'd be safe. Is that not a reasonable doubt? Tell me, which article in the Criminal Code says rape involves fighting back? None, right? The law was amended 20 years ago. Study more. It's for your own good. The first statement is vital. She wasn't ready at all. I know that, obviously. Thanks though. Don't call me for these cases. I can't help you. Kai-ting. Zhang Kai-ting! Why were you in a fight? He was looking through my backpack. What's the big deal? Why didn't you tell the teacher? I didn't want to. Should I... tell the teacher for you? No. Has Xiaoting been acting odd lately? Your daughter's a woman now. Didn't you know? So should I buy and prepare? It's all right, I have everything. Why didn't you tell me earlier? Why should I? You can't help me anyway. You know I hate these types of cases. Forget it, just drop it. Do you know "presumption of innocence"? What if the girl is lying? History: Mr. Zhe Di Be exam-ready with Mr. Zhe Di Cram schools on Nanyang Street Cram schools on Nanyang Street Celebrity tutor Mr. Zhe Di Does he have previous rape convictions? Rape convictions? If he does, they would be reported, right? It's a registered cram school. That doesn't mean it's lawful. I know his real name isn't Tang Wen-hua. What makes you so sure, Mr. Zhang? I've seen his photos. I know this man. What's the difference between a burglary and an armed burglary? The punishment's worse for the latter. Why didn't you fight for a lighter charge? Rewrite it. But Mr. Chen admitted to bringing a wrench. Did he use it? But a wrench is objectively dangerous. Regardless of his or her initial intention to harm... did I hire you to memorize precedents? My strategy is - showing remorse as a mitigating factor... - Okay. So tell me, what if he's charged with aggravated burglary? His probation would be revoked. But he's already admitted... What else would a burglar bring? A lollipop? So, by the logic of those outdated judges, a clenched fist is a weapon as well? Is your genitalia a weapon too? Mr. Zhang, you know why clients pay so much for me? I don't just understand the law, I also have the guts to challenge it You're not a judge. Stop thinking like one. You need to try to outsmart them. Mr. Zhang. Fold your robe properly. Sir, round-trip ticket to Luodong. That'll be 366 dollars. 366... Here's 400. Can I get a ocean-side seat? Sure. 1:47 p.m. Train number 3907 northbound express to Su-ao will depart from platform 4A. Please board the train now. Chen Xin You're Chen Xin, right? It's just that... I'm Uncle Zhang's son. The one who... ...who often drinks tea with your dad? Because your dad told my dad, that... you're in Taipei by yourself, and I happen to work in Taipei, so he hoped that I could look after you. But you know... How could they possibly... So... are our grandmas also best friends? Your house, it's near Gongzheng Road, over in alley 69, and then take a left turn... The one with the dog, right? You mean the haunted house? What are you writing? My diary. Diary? Do people still do that? What do you do? I'm a lawyer. No wonder you don't keep one. Touch√©. Is high school even worth writing about? My high school life's pretty amazing. Really? Pity, the weather's bad. We can't see Turtle Island. Usually, I get a window seat, just to see Turtle Island. Why are you sitting there then? My dad's never mentioned you, but it does sound like something he'd do. It's fine. My dad's the same. Nice to meet you. I'm Chen Xin, as you know. Zhang Zheng-xu, "Zheng" as in justice. "Xu" like sunlight. Zhang Zheng-xu. Hi. - Ms. Du. - Mr. Tang. Thank you for waiting. This is my new employee, Mr. Zhang. Hello, Mr. Tang. This is my card. I am Zhang Zheng-xu. Please help yourselves. You can bet on it. I can't think of anyone else who'd have such an appetite at your age. This student, the complainant... How old is she? Mr. Tang, you may have doubts about him, but you've got to trust me. She's a student at the cram school. She's about 17 or 18. When was the first time you two did it? About one or two years ago. Mr. Zhang, remember to check her age. It's crucial to our strategy. Okay. What's her name? Tong Xi-zhen. "Tong" as in child. Does she have any evidence? How could she possibly have any? We really were in love. Image is everything. Especially for our line of work. Is she suing you for sexual assault? Rape without evidence isn't rape. Mr. Zhang, did you read fairy tales as a child? Do you know why Red Riding Hood helped Big Bad Wolf? You don't know? Finish that and I'll tell you. Red Riding Hood slept with the wolf, why was he the only one punished? Hi doggy! Bye! Guo Shi-qi Do you remember me? I'm Zhang. We met at the police station Here's my card. I'm here about the case. I know some great lawyers who'd... He changed his name. His name was Tang Shi-cheng. My driver can give you a lift. We're good, thanks. Let's have a chat in my office and sort out the details. Thanks for your trouble. No worries. Bye. Let's go. I believe you. But it doesn't matter what I think. The court needs evidence. Do fairy tales... count as evidence? One more chance. Thanks. What a human rights lawyer. You're not so bad either... How did you get into the top high school? Basketball scholarship. Basketball scholarship? Wow! Incoming floater layup! Sorry! The ball's too new, it screwed up my game. Way to blame it on the ball. I meant it messed up my dribbling, it's not about bad luck. You sure can talk. That's why you're a lawyer, right? Does that mean you'll become a lawyer too? No way. What do you want to do then? I want to be... a photographer for National Geographic So you plan to study photography? I don't know. My dad says... that teaching is a steady job, so it's better for girls. You can always keep photography as hobby. That's exactly what my dad said. What's the dumbest thing you did back in high school? I liked this girl, so I invited her to play basketball and then I wanted to take her to a movie. And? Nothing happened. Why? I broke her front teeth by accident. No, wait. Why would you invite... a sweaty girl to the movies? So what was your dumbest thing? Do you like it? Head back to class first. Why? You're not late if you're earlier than me. I'm not late if we come at the same time. Cause, turning point, and effect. Why do we memorize these as a set? In the study of history, it's more important to know the why rather than the what. A student asked me about the link between the European Reformation and the Civil Rights Movement. Does anyone know? America's Martin Luther had a dream It's not the "95 Theses" Martin Luther, nor the "Dr. Martens" who sells boots. Tang Shi-cheng If the case goes to trial, everybody would find out, right? Please don't worry. Such cases aren't open to the public. Not open to the public? Such relationships flood the news. How can it be kept from the public? Mr. Guo, it's not a relationship. Shi-qi, I need you to think hard, try to recall everything, the details and the dates. What happened? Screwed up your exams? Come on, give me a smile, you look ugly like that. Take these. What for? You look constipated, you might need them. Come on. You're so lame. Don't worry. Just do better next time. Okay. We still have some time. Let me show you a place. I always come here... when I'm in a bad mood. They say that the frog in the well is a foolish frog. But I think... it's the happiest frog in the world. Ribbit ribbit! Update me on the next court session. There will be a hostile witness. I've drafted the questions. She was also one of Mr. Tang's students. She's in the same class as the victim. As the complainant. In the same class as the complainant. Do you have a photo of her? What must be proven as fact? Sexual misconduct. She can't prove that the sex happened. Is there even an imbalance of power here? I looked up the precedents. It depends. According to the precedents, if a defendant's proven to have authority, the victim would usually... The complainant. Sorry, the complainant would usually be thought to have acted in forced compliance So what defines "authority" exactly? A top-down, hierarchical relationship. How vague. So they can basically say anything, isn't that right? Yes, it doesn't work in Mr. Tang's favor. Since such relationships are hierarchical, why does the prosecutor need this witness? It's because of this face. It's hard to get direct evidence proving he abused his authority for sex. The prosecutor knows this. There is only one way to link the two. Imagination. Let's call it a day. Ms. Du, do you believe they're dating? Why is this so important to you? Don't you want to know? I already know. But if Mr. Tang's lying, shouldn't we, as lawyers... What you imagine as a lawyer has nothing to do with the truth. It's probably closer to an adult film. But the truth... The so-called truth is irrelevant to justice in court. Compassion too, has no place there. The moment the door is shut, no matter how pure the girl was, she'll lose her claim to innocence. Are you okay? Yes. Don't be nervous. You're so stiff. In accordance with the Sexual Assault Crime Prevention Act, this is a closed hearing. The complainant is present here today. We have placed her in a different room to separate her from the defendant. The witness we subpoenaed today is... Your Honor, there is no need to call the witness. Your reason? The defendant admits to a power disparity. Prosecutor, your thoughts? She can tell us how he treats his students, and clarify how he abused his authority to force the victim into sex. Therefore, the witness is essential She wasn't in the same room when they had sex. She wouldn't know if it was consensual. Just ask her and we'll know. Your Honor, this case concerns my client's reputation. We should abstain from prejudice. According to the Act, a power disparity and forced compliance are different things. The latter is the result of the former. Yes. And we've already admitted to that. So why are we questioning her? Your Honor, this is a fallacy. Your Honor, the prosecutor is using the witness to twist our understanding of power and forced compliance. He's exploiting our witness and trying to showcase before our eyes a scene from an adult film. Power isn't about one's ability to do things, but what he can make people do. The display of power isn't only present during sex. So, what is forced compliance exactly? Prosecutor, why don't you enlighten us? Counselor Du, drop the attitude. When students are given homework, and they can't choose not to do it, is this forced compliance? When your wife makes love to you at night, could that be forced compliance? Say that again! Defense council, show some respect. This is a courtroom. NTNU professor Li Jian-huan was charged with rape four years ago. The case has seen recent developments. The professor's spouse sued the student for adultery. She was eventually given a guilty verdict. Please allow me to quote the verdict. The defendant was passive, but did not put up a fight, and let the action happen. Knowing the importance of virginity, it was decided that she gave consent. She was hence charged with adultery. We all know how important virginity is to a woman. She was free to say no, but she didn't. Don't you find that strange? Dating one's teacher is not a crime. There's no abuse of authority involved. But seducing a married man is unlawful. Are you threatening the complainant? That's adultery. Enough, both sides. If you're afraid, we can stop anytime. Xiaoxin, do you know the story of the Frog Prince? A wet, sticky frog waits for the princess' kiss As long as the promise is kept, what we just did is beautiful in a way. Don't you find fairy tales beautiful? I've never seen a prince as old as you. I'm sorry. Don't be sorry. You're too good for me. Mr. Tang, are you afraid? Don't be afraid. I want to report Zhe Di Education Center's founder, Tang Wenhua. He's accused of sexual assault. The victim has already taken legal action. This is my name card, I'm Zhang. Which one went through your bag? Hey! Get over here, hurry. Do you want to join us? Okay. The two of us versus you four. Let's use our ball. Sure! Ready? Let's start I'll block, you shoot! Oh, no. Councilor, regarding this case, I've only just found out about it too. This accusation is totally biased. It's very unfair to Mr. Tang. Yes, you're right. How about this? I'll remove Ms. Jian from this case. I'm afraid that won't be enough. Please reinvestigate. It might not be the first time. This could be seen as malfeasance. My husband volunteered. City Commissioner, I promise, we will definitely reinvestigate. Mr. Tang, are you afraid to admit your filthy behavior? Watch your words. I see why you two make a pair. You're just like Zhang. Things are always tougher for sentimental people like you two. You know Zhang Zheng-xu? Mr. Tang, it's been a while. I'm half-retired, I don't really take cases anymore. Mr. Zhang? Are you talking about Zhang Zheng-xu? Ms. Du, care for some tea? I have some excellent stuff for you Is this where you raped Guo Shi-qi? How many girls have you screwed here over the years? I'll take this case on one condition. Settlement. Also, I'll decide the amount. Mr. Zhang, we're the complainant here. Why is Qi-qi in juvenile court? What's going on? Let's go. Please don't worry. Guo Shiqi, we received a criminal complaint, accusing you of adultery. Because you're currently underage, you've been brought to juvenile court. We'll be investigating this today Don't be nervous. If you have questions, I'll explain everything clearly to you. Your attorney will help you as well. Your Honor, Shi-qi is a rape victim. I understand, but we have to follow the procedures. Understood. Guo Shi-qi was 15 when she was assaulted. According to the Ministry of Justice, in Article 227 of the Criminal Code, for the protection of underaged persons, even if the other party is married, the underaged person cannot be charged with adultery. Accusing a rape victim of adultery, and then dropping the charge against the spouse. Isn't it obvious? Your Honor, we just received this. This is a letter from the Bar Association. It mentions a conflict of interest, advising us to remove you as her attorney. (Chairman Du Zi-zhen) You know Tang Wen-hua? Yes. You were his lawyer? I was. Why didn't you tell me? I knew you'd worry. How could I tell you? Anything else I need to know? Was it also a sexual assault case? What happened in the end? I won. I have an appointment with Ms. Du. Sorry for making you wait. We're asked you to come here to discuss the terms of the settlement. We're willing to pay three million NTD on the condition that Guo Shi-qi signs a confession stating that. She entered a relationship with Mr. Tang, and apologize to his wife. Here, have a look How about me? What's in it for me? If you agree, I'll help with the investigation concerning you and your wife. Is that it? Mr. Zhang, Three million isn't a small amount. You won't get this much even in a civil court. And since this is a criminal case, there's no way you'd win. Is that so? Your past involvement with Tong Xi-zhen will damage Guo Shi-qi's testimony. You're only jeopardizing her case. Different cases, same old trick. Who do you think the judge will believe? Ten million NTD Did your client authorized you to demand this amount? Ten million NTD? Mr. Zhang. It's been so long. Are you still hung up on Chen Xin? Xiaoxin and I, we really did fell in love. Don't misunderstand us. Of course. I believe you. Attorney at Law, Zhang Zheng-xu Hello? Hello. Hello. Are you done with your exams? How did you do? Do you want to come out for some air? Maybe next time. I have another exam coming up. When are you going back to Luodong? We can take the train together. Sure. Let's go on the 32nd. Okay. Okay what? 31st, okay? -Okay -So, 31st then. - 31st? Yes? - Yes. Okay, bye. Do you know why 007 is named Bond? No, why? Because after he sleeps with girls, they all say how great he is. Your bow's crooked, let me fix it for you. Looks pretty. Thank you. Come sit down. Okay. Wait for me at the exit. Did you take these? Yes, it's my first collection. Why am I in it? You did a great job What's with you? Those are mine. I'm busy today. Go home. Get off. Get off! Someone's paging you. Go. Don't take photos of me anymore. Hey you, Ms. Popular. You weren't late, you bailed on me. Was it today? Yes... Yes, it's today. Isn't it tomorrow? I'm sorry! Come on, we said today. Okay, tomorrow... How about we go tomorrow? - How about... - See you How about some supper? - Or... - Nah, I'm exhausted. Huh? Are you okay? Yes. You sure? Are you sure? Had a fight with your boyfriend? Go home. Bye-bye, good night! No... Wait... Wait. If anyone dares to hurt you, I'll sue them to death. The law can't solve every problem, you know Good night, Mr. Big Shot lawyer. Come in. Ms. Du, Mr. Tang is here. Hello Mr. Tang. What does this document mean? Did you receive it? Yes, I did. Come, have a seat. It says that. Tong Xi-zhen wants an open trial. I don't get it. What do you mean? It means everyone can attend the hearings. Can we refuse? No, we can't. A closed hearing is the right of the complainant. If she chooses to forfeit this right, there's nothing we can do about it. Here. Have a drink, take the edge off. In the next hearing, Tong Xi-zhen will testify. Why did she choose an open trial? Maybe she's found out you don't love her. You love your career more, so she has nothing to lose now. What can we do? What should we do? She's not a typical victim. For Tong Xi-zhen, an open trial is a double-edged sword. What do you mean? Her purpose is very clear. She wants to tell everyone how she was sexually assaulted. Whether it's true or false, it will ruin your reputation. To her, the results don't matter anymore. All she wants is to destroy you. In a way, you could call it love. We... We kept thinking we have to prove it's a relationship. But... What if she's just a slut? Proving that a schoolgirl fell for you versus a slut seducing a married man, which one's easier? She wants to attack you with morality. We'll do the same to her. Rape or Taboo Love? Celebrity tutor in hot water Mr. Tang, public opinion means a lot to us. Please be careful. Don't get into trouble. Mr. Tang. It's great to be young. You're not bad. Mr. Zhang, do you have a girlfriend? Do you have someone in your mind? I got dumped. If you want, we can go for a night ride, or karaoke. I know there's a night market nearby, just ten minutes away by scooter. What do you like about me? I don't know. You make fun of me a lot, you don't reply my calls, and you stood me up, but I just can't get mad at you. Bye. Did you ever love me? Of course. What do you love about me? What do you love about me? I saw the news. Did you do this to other girls too? Did you tell them you love them too? Did you take them to watch airplanes too? I have evidence. I know a lawyer. No, I don't want to. No. No. No. Criminal summons. Get rid of this. Stay back! Keep back please! Move back! Hello, Mr. Tang. Sorry to keep you waiting. It's time to let this young man shine. Zhang, I'm counting on you. Case number 316 The trial will proceed in open court on the wishes of the complainant. Today we will review the evidence. The witness will testify in a separate room. Witness, could you tell us about the first time you were coerced into sex? On April 27th at 9 p.m., after class, he said he wanted to help with my exam, and called me to his office. He asked me to take a seat on the couch. He then came over and started touching me. From my wrist, then up to my breasts. And then, he began removing my clothes. He told me not to fear because he loved me. And then... he raped me. Did you tell anybody about this? No. Why not? He said that he loved me and asked me to believe him. Witness, what do you wear to the cram school? My school uniform. I have some photos here. Could you look at them, and confirm that it's you. How did you get these photos? Please answer my question. Are you the person in the photos? Yes. Is this the uniform you usually wear? Yes, but I don't usually wear it that way. On the night of the 27th, were you wearing this particular uniform? I don't usually dress that way. You can't just... Please answer my question. The night you claim the rape occurred, were you wearing this uniform? It's a little revealing, isn't it? Objection. The complainant's dress is irrelevant. Your Honor, questioning the witness' credibility is allowed during cross-examination. We're still establishing a premise. Objection overruled. Defense counsel, please get to the point. On the night of April 27th, were you wearing these clothes? Yes. Before you had sex with your teacher, did he give you any gifts? Yes. What kind of gifts? Did he give you a camera? Yes. Do you think that students should be receiving such gifts? He said he loved me and wanted to support my dream. On the night of the 27th, when my client called you to his office, there were just the two of you, correct? Yes. Didn't you find that strange? Or you are used to being alone with men? Objection. That's a personal attack. Counselor Zhang mind your questions. Did the defendant make verbal threats? No. Was he physically violent that night? - No. - No? Good. Let's clarify the facts On that night, you and Mr. Tang were alone in the office, which you didn't find strange. When he started to touch you, he made no verbal or physical threats such that you were unable to resist. But you did not leave, is this correct? No... I was... Is it safe to say that you liked the presents, and you're in love with Mr. Tang, so you weren't against having sex with him? No, I wasn't in love with him. No, I wasn't. I wasn't. I wasn't. No, I wasn't. I wasn't in love with him. Counselor, any other questions? Witness, how did you feel after being raped? Objection! This is humiliation! Defense Attorney, last warning. Please respect the court, focus your questions on the subject case. Look at me. Look at me! Don't forget what you're fighting for. You are a lawyer. Witness, the day after the incident, did you attend school as usual? Yes. Did you attend same cram school, until the university entrance exams ended? Yes. So after you were raped, you still attended school and the lessons, It took you six months. to feel that something was off? He said that he loved me. He said that he was the Frog Prince. To transform, I had to accept his kiss. So, you slept with the prince because of a fairy tale? No, no! No! No! Court adjourned. Audience, please leave now. No! No! Are you satisfied with your career after practicing law for so many years? I feel like I'm still not earning enough. I can't afford an office like this. It's never easy to become someone you want to be. But it's even harder to become someone you're not. Zhen-xu. You're the best lawyer I've mentored. You're just unlucky. I've never regretted anything I've done. Let's make a settlement. Is Tang Shi-cheng still not giving up? He doesn't know about this meeting. Then there's no point discussing this. You know what will happen in court. "Will we win?" Guo Shi-qi must have asked you this. What did you tell her? I know why you took on this case. I'm very worried about you, but I'm more worried about Guo Shi-qi. I met Tong Xi-zhen many years later. It took me some time to find her. I found out that she worked in a bank. I went to visit her. We chatted for a bit. She's doing pretty okay. I'm sure she still hates us. But you know, feeling hatred isn't always a bad thing. Women must learn to hate to able to survive in this world. The last thing she said was, "I wish I had accepted the settlement." Mend or polish? Polishing is 200 NTD, take a seat. Here. Take a seat. These are good shoes. Take them off later, I'll shine them. Mr. Guo, I'm sorry. Letting the case go to trial... Is that the best for Qi-qi? Forget the Bar Association letter. It's just a scare tactic. There's no conflict of interest. I can still be Shi-qi's lawyer. Mr. Zhang, Mr. Tang came to see me. Mr. Guo, we shouldn't take the settlement. But if we do, how should we do it? Mr. Guo, your daughter was hurt, as a father, shouldn't you... But we're in the wrong too. I failed to educate her. She changed since high school. She cut her hair short. I doubt she studied at the cram school. And Mr. Tang, he doesn't look like a violent person. You don't have to be to coerce someone. Who would marry her in the future then? Excuse me, I need to use the toilet. Money is nothing to Tang Wen-hua. Only a criminal charge would bring Shi-qi justice. What is justice? What use is it? We can still claim for civil compensation. It still sounds the same to me. Mr. Guo, can you promise me one thing? Don't tell your daughter the settlement amount. This is her life. How about Tong Xi-zhen's case? Mr. Zhang, didn't you defend Mr. Tang in a similar case? If we don't take it, what will happen during the trial? Shouldn't you tell your client? Did Qi-qi tell you where she was going? You saw her leave? Yes, she ran out. Who's the girl in the photo? When you make a decision, do you ever think of me? I just want to tell you, everything you're doing now, it's not only hurting Shi-qi, it's hurting us too. Mr. Zhang, I'm sorry. Would you still be my lawyer? A lawyer should follow the client's instructions, right? I want a settlement. Shi-qi, is that really what you want? Mr. Tang didn't force me. When we were together, when I saw him happy, I felt happy as well. Do you know that if you accept the money, more students will get hurt? Do you understand? I like Mr. Tang I really do. I don't know what's wrong with me. But breakups, they're suppose to be painful, aren't they? If this is because of your father or it's about the money, I promise you I'll... Zhang Zhen-xu, have you gone mad? Sir, please wait inside. This way please. How much does Mr. Zhang get? I wasn't very confident at first. This much money... This isn't you. Who'd have known? After so many years, I can still benefit this much from Tong Xi-zhen's case. By the way, I have to say, young girls these days are really something. The other day, Shi-qi told me some things about you two. We laughed our asses off. The Frog Prince indeed. Mr. Zhang, have you ever seen a young girl's handwriting? It's different from how grown women write. Their hopes and dreams are put on those pieces of exam paper. Their handwriting. I love it when they write my name, Tang-Shi-Cheng. Again and again. It's like correcting exam papers. If they don't write it perfectly, I wouldn't let them put their clothes on. Mr. Zhang, as a man, I'm sure you understand When a woman loses her mind over you, and become crazy about you, there's nothing more romantic than that. You may be a romantic, but I can see you're quite single-minded. You still prefer the short-haired ones. I cut it. I cut Qi-qi's hair. Why? Don't you think, from a certain angle, she looks like Xiaoxin? Especially the part at the nape. So I cut it off in one go. It's quite a pity. Such long, beautiful hair. I even told her, half-jokingly, that I would like to keep it. She gave it to me without a thought. Mr. Tang, let's leave. All right One should always obey his lawyer. Mr. Tang, tell me. Seventeen years ago. Why me? Because Chen Xin would be there. Didn't you know? That's just how she is. She has to figure everything out. Plus, she often mentioned you. It made me a little jealous, actually. What did she say? She said she knew a lawyer. And that she'd sue me. Sue me to death. Counselor Zhang Zheng-xu reveals that he's made contact with a crucial witness who's worked for Tang for a long time. It may come as a shock to know that many years ago, Zhang himself defended Tang Wen-hua in court. This has generated much discourse. Counselor Zhang's whistleblowing could be considered an offense against privacy, breach of trust and secrecy. If charged, Zhang could face disbarment. In light of his unethical conduct, and failure to protect the victim's identity, the Bar Association has suspended his legal license. Are you okay? Would you like to listen to a fairy tale?
