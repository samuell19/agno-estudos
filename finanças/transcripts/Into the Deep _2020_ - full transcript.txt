[tense music playing] [woman on radio] Nautilus, Nautilus, Nautilus, what is your position? [helicopter whirring] Nautilus FPET one zero seven, what is your position? All ships… All ships from the area of Copenhagen, we are looking for a private submarine, Nautilus, black, and 18 meters long. Ships with any information, call Sea Rescue. [boat engine whirring] [reporter] Latest news this morning, a search is underway in the sea around Copenhagen for a privately built submarine which went missing on Thursday night. On board was a journalist and the owner of the submarine, Danish inventor Peter Madsen, best known for his rocket-building program, funded and manned by volunteers. Apparently, Peter left on the submarine last night with a journalist. We're very worried. So he didn't come. [man 1] Yeah, so we're not sure what's going on. For the record, the coastguard is also on that case. [man 1] Yeah, it's not just us guys, no. [man 2] There's still hope of finding them alive. - [man 1] Okay. - There's air for 24 hours, maybe 30. - [woman] Who's the journalist? - [man 1] No. I'm not sure who or what. [man 1] It could make a big difference. I don't know. [indistinct radio chatter] [woman] Did he mention anything to you? [man 1] No. I didn't know that he was sailing. [woman] And we're sure it's a professional trip and not a date? [man 1] Would sound like Peter's shenanigans, but apparently not. [man 3] Oh, I just heard, somebody's seen the submarine laying next to Amager. - [man 2] They find it? - No. But they're sending a helicopter to check. Somebody saw something lying next to the bridge. The bridge to Sweden. - [helicopter whirring] - [radio interference] [man in Danish] There's something ahead. I've spotted it. Nautilus. - [man 3 in English] They found him! - [man 4] Where, what? Don't stop running... They're gonna be here in a few hours. They're on their way to Refshaleøen. - So… - [woman vocalizing] [man 1] We don't know a lot yet. We just heard that he's been found. What a way to wake up. [Chuckles] [man 1] You get this picture in your mind of them being trapped under the water, with few hours left. It's a relief that he's okay. [man 3] Two and a half hours. Okay, two and a half hours until he's here. [man 1] It sank. [woman] Sorry, it's just 'cause I didn't hear it in English. Someone… Someone's just posted this. "We know from the rescue helicopter that the submarine sank… has sunk." "Peter was standing in the tower." - [woman] So yeah, it did sink. - It did sink. Let's just keep… Let's keep fact right now. The only thing we know, UC3 Nautilus has sunk, for whatever reason, we don't know why. And the only ones that know that is… is the journalist and Peter that's on board and we'll have to recap on that. But they're both good. [Sighs] They're both fine, which is [engine turns over] the most important thing. Okay, see you. So, um, the problem is that, um, the… the rescue vehicle only has Peter. And apparently, the journalist was put onshore, uh, sometime last evening. But her boyfriend and her family haven't heard from her. [man 1] It's strange that no one knows about the passenger. - [man 4] Yeah. - And if she was set ashore last night, why didn't she contact her boyfriend and her parents? - Something in this story does not add up. - [man 5] I wonder where she is. [woman] Peter! Are you okay? [Peter in Danish] I'm fine. A bit sad. - [reporter] You're sad? - Obviously. Watching Nautilus sink was distressing. [in English] Oh, this right now? Live? [in Danish] I was on a test run where I played around with some stuff. Then an error occurred on her ballast tank. [reporter] Okay. It wasn't that serious until I tried to repair it. Then it became very serious. It took 30 seconds for Nautilus to sink, and I couldn't close the hatches. But that's okay. Otherwise, I'd still be down there. [reporter] What about your passenger? There was no one else but me on board. [woman in English] Where's she? How come she hasn't shown up? - [man 2] Who? - The journalist. [man 6] I haven't heard anything. Only what Peter said. [woman] Now he's with the police to get the story straight? [man 6] Yeah. I really hope they find her. [reporter] …off onshore. She is now missing. Madsen meanwhile has been arrested and taken into police custody. [intense music playing] [woman wails, cries] [music builds, halts] [mic crackles] Okay, so I'm researching online and I find a TED Talk by a guy called Peter Madsen. [Peter chats indistinctly] [Emma] He is a Danish celebrity who's built three submarines, and his latest mission is to launch himself into space in a homemade rocket. He's doing this with very little funding, just some donations, and money he gets from his lectures. And incredibly, people from all around the world have come to Denmark to help him. So I write to him suggesting I make a documentary about his rocket quest, and this is what he sends back. "Emma. You are about to submerge into quite a snake pit." "I am writing to you from the inside of a mechanical whale, the ballistic missile submarine Nautilus." "Tonight she is my home, and being here makes me feel very safe." "But the lab, as we call RML here, is much more than Nautilus." "It is positively a crazy story of teamwork, sky-high ambitions, and the commitment and courage amongst the many people "who get into orbit around the space lab." "All the best, Peter Madsen." - [Peter] Yeah, okay. - [man] Yeah. [Emma] Hey, how are you? [tools clanging] [Peter] This is a world premiere. First time in the history of the space lab, I can now reveal the Imperial Star Destroyer that'll bring yours truly into the high stratosphere and beyond, and into space. This is what we're doing. This is our intercontinental ballistic missile, uh, passenger ship, under construction. [soldering iron buzzing] [upbeat music playing] You see? - Looks good. - It looks fucking marvelous. [Emma] What's the ultimate mission of RML? To make dreams come true. - [both chuckle] - To play in an old derelict shipyard… [counts down in Danish] …and make every crazy concept into reality. It's a wonderful piece of work here. 720 triangles, and it's gonna be a space station. But it's also the place where the interns and volunteers play. None of these people are paid, but they come here and they can be part of something enormous.' We're either gonna go into history as the greatest heroes or the greatest criminals, and I'm gonna bet it's the criminals. The purpose of this is to put a man in space. So we are going to launch three rockets in the Baltic Ocean during the summer of 2017. [engine gushing] So it's not a dream for much longer. [men chuckle] [musically] Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. No, no, no. Sit down. Yeah, sitting down. I'm calm. Are you calm? I'm not. [Chuckles] Everybody, this is flights. We can confirm we've got flameouts and area is safe and open. - [Peter chats indistinctly] - Good. Perfect. Hey, oi. - Fist bump. - [chuckles] No, no, no. No, no, no, no. - [Peter] Aw. - [both chuckle] [Christoffer] For many years, I had on my bucket list that I would really love to go diving with a submarine. For my Christmas present from my wife, I actually got an opportunity to go diving with Peter's submarine. I found someone who shares the same passion for science and engineering. I… I think you could say that in 2007, our relationship, and… and the beginning of our friendship really kicked off. It's… It's been more than ten years. We keep going back to the point that if we have a core of people then we can build a team that can make this happen. Mm. [woman] In the beginning, I would look outside my window and it would just look like this lab, like, equipment everywhere and it was like, "What is this?" And he was like, "Oh, this is a space lab." And it was just like, my jaw dropped immediately. I was just like, "A space lab?" Space rockets? Are you frickin' kidding me? I need to be a part of what you're doing. [in Danish] We are making history. [in English] One thing there is with Peter is that he's definitely the most… [in Danish] And this is Peter, Peter Madsen. [in English] …epic person you've ever met. He's an artist. He has a personality like an artist. He's always saying, "You're kind of like me, going with the wind, being impulsive." That's why we click so good together, because we understand each other's emotions and each other's passions, and he knows how to pick me up from where I just feel like I'm worth nothing. And he knows how to tell me I'm great as I am. [Peter] Let's get ready for our briefing. What we're gonna do today is to expose our astronaut pilot to high acceleration. We do that by spinning him around in this centrifuge that we built outside. [man] The reason I applied for an internship was because of Peter. Because he seems like something special and… and he seems like he was different, and I always wanted to meet him. He had awesome videos on YouTube and he was on television. [Peter] They say that you're crazy, you're going to die. But they're also gonna die ultimately and not gonna have all the fun to do this sort of thing. [Stefan] And I thought I really would like to be like this guy. Have you been inside the submarine yet? It's quite nice. Peter has this idea how things, um, could work. It's a mixture between, I don't know, craziness and doing something completely new. Radio check, sector one. - [man 1 on radio] Sector one, clear. - Sector two? Sector two, clear. [Emma] Would you jump in it? Jump in the rocket? Holy Christ, this is really happening. That is why I'm here. - [on radio] …six… - [chuckles] …five, four, three, two, one. [engine gushing] [crowd applauding, cheering] [whistling] Friends, it's fine! A-okay, yoo-hoo! This is great! [Peter and crowd cheer] - It's a great, great, great day. - I told you we was gonna see you again. [all laughing] - You're good at math, young man. - Thank you. [indistinct overlapping chatter] Everybody says, "Yes!" - [scattered] Yes! Woo! - Yeah! - [indistinct chatter] - Yes! [ominous music playing] We don't have any facts. - We don't. - We don't. And the only… the only thing we know is that Peter is safe. We have no information on the second passenger. [reporter in Danish] Of course, we want to know who was on board with him. A Swedish journalist? I don't know, um… There's nothing odd about us having people, journalists, on board. The terrible thing about it is that the journalist hasn't yet been found. That's absolutely devastating. The way I know Peter Madsen, and the way he always acts, if she was on board when the submarine sank, I can guarantee that he would have helped her out first. There are indications that he dropped her off last night in Copenhagen, and then went out on his own. Nobody knows where she is, and that's terrible. She has a family and a boyfriend who don't know where she is, and they must be absolutely devastated. [in English] Yeah, but maybe she was just delivered to a destination and… and then Peter left or wanted to go back and she didn't know about it, maybe. - I'm a bit curious about that theory line. - [indistinct chatter] [Emma] The latest news. [news theme song plays] [reporter in Danish] Peter Madsen has been charged with killing a Swedish journalist. The Swedish woman's boyfriend sounded the alarm when she didn't return. He says that he dropped her off on Refshaleøen. [Emma in English] Hang on. He's been charged with killing her? What was that? Peter… Peter says that he... this Swedish woman journalist, that he set her ashore on Refshaleøen last night. [Stefan] Okay. Which, like, it wouldn't make sense that she wouldn't contact her boyfriend? Of all the people, that's the only one who says she was put ashore. - [Emma] Yeah. - Yeah. [man] Yeah, so it's definitely suspicious. [Sara] Yeah. [reporter 1] Police continue their search for the missing journalist and ask if you have any information, to contact Danish police. [reporter 2] Kim Wall's work has been published internationally in a wide range of publications, including the New York Times, Harper's Magazine and The Guardian. She's won an award for her reporting on climate change and nuclear weapons testing in the Marshall Islands. Wall had written to Peter Madsen several months ago for an interview, intended for a Wired Magazine article. Police continue to search for her while Madsen remains in custody. We'll continue this report as more details come in. [reporter 3 in Danish] Peter Madsen has been charged with killing the 30-year-old woman. He denies the charges and claims to have put her ashore… [Stefan] Who's that guy? [reporter 3] The submarine was found in Køge Bay. It'll be salvaged and investigated. [in English] Right now, uh, some… some reporter's outside. [Christoffer on phone] The only thing we can do right now is still lay low in the next couple days. Hopefully there will come details about this woman's disappearance, uh, because I think her family and everybody else, uh, really needs to understand what happened to her. I really have a hard time understanding why it should be related to Peter at all. Let's wait and see over the next few days. Bye-bye. [Stefan] What would you do if just a person falls overboard? Maybe he couldn't contact anybody so the… the person was gone and he has no emergency ring and he couldn't see here. - [Emma] Yeah. - Because it was dark and he freaks out. - [reporter continues indistinctly] - And I don't think the police know. Only Peter knows. We'll see. - [Emma] They're towing the sub back now? - [Stefan] Yeah. [Emma] I hope there's a living woman out there. - [Stefan] Yeah. - [man] Yeah. [Emma] I really hope that. [reporter in Danish] He claims to have put the woman ashore near restaurant Halvandet. The police are checking CCTV from the restaurant and the wharf. [machinery whirring] [Peter in English] Behind us, you have the space lab submarine, the control ship for the rockets launch system. She's undergoing service, and when that's all done, she's ready to go sailing. [man] Wow. [machinery whirring] [Peter] Hi. [Emma] I want to talk to you today. Um, whatever time works out. [Peter] Well, anytime is as bad as any other. [Emma chuckles] Yeah. Four, three, two, one, zero. - [Emma] Liftoff. - [chuckles] I… I have very little experience in counting the other way. [Chuckles] [Emma] RML isn't the only amateur space lab on this island, so I want to talk about Copenhagen Suborbitals, the other group here that has the same goal as you to become the first amateur astronaut and rewind right back before it all went awry. All right. The beginning of Copenhagen Suborbitals was something that happened in… in 2008. I had for some years been working on the Nautilus. And after the Nautilus gets launched, I know what I want to do next is a rocket project. I started Copenhagen Suborbitals with Kristian von Bengtson. I invested six years of my life in CS, every dime I could obtain went into that project. And we had some fantastic launches… [rocket gushing] …that made headlines around the world. Shortly before our last rocket launch together, I remember being called to Kristian's office. And he says, "Peter, I don't know if I can have you attend the next launch." "Okay, so what I am to do is just to build the rocket, and then you will make sure to have it launched?" "Something like that." It didn't feel… I didn't feel right that I've... Okay, I've done it again, I've gotten myself a boss! Whenever I want to do something I can ask for permission. If I'm lucky, I might even be allowed to take part in the launches of my own fucking rockets, what am I here for? And it was so meaningless for me to be in this club, that I left. It was a process where everyone you know, with very few exceptions, a few friends, my wife, is suddenly becoming not just not friends, but your opponents. [Emma] They're within eye shot. That must be... [Peter] Yeah, they're 85 meters away. I often think about it as the distance in the World War One, you had the no man's land, and there's the barbed wire around the place. And they have said, "We are never going to resolve this problem." "We will ignore you for all time." "No peace ever." Let that be everything I have to say about the man. [Emma chuckles] Yeah, we've got that conversation out of the way. [reporter 1] We're back with a case that sounds like it's right out of a mystery novel. What happened to a journalist who's feared dead after she sailed out aboard a private submarine to interview a well-known inventor? [reporter 2] Ms. Wall was researching a story for Wired Magazine about the space race between Madsen and his former rocket group, Copenhagen Suborbitals, otherwise known as CS. [reporter 3] Journalist Kim Wall hasn't been seen or heard from since. [reporter 4] The sub was raised off the seabed on Saturday. No one, either dead or alive, was found inside. Meanwhile, the search for Ms. Wall or her body continues. Right here, I have my studio, and, uh, over there there's, like, where Kim and Ole have their… their studio. And, um, they're actually gonna move to Beijing on Tuesday. And Nautilus normally is in the harbor five minutes' walk from here. I was thinking that she might have been lost and walked this way. And maybe she fell, or... Because it's all black, like, it's all dark when… when the sun is down it's all dark. It's three days ago now. I still don't feel my body. When they said, "Peter has been charged with homicide." Right there, when you get that information, you just, the whole, everything just freeze… In that moment. [Emma] And did you talk to him that week? [Sara] I talked to him every day. Actually, the last thing he wrote to me was, "Nautilus is sailing so good. Let's go on a trip tomorrow." [Emma] Was that the day that she disappeared? Yeah. Kim, I just met her once. Her boyfriend and her live at my friend' place. And I really want to find any evidence that she's been kidnapped. So I'm much more in the mind of finding her right now and also to help Peter. But I think I can help Peter by finding her as quick as possible. I just know in my heart that Peter is innocent. That's why Kim's boyfriend, when he asked me… "Do you think Peter could have raped her and killed her?" And I just answer, "No." "No. Not in ever... No." [Emma] Isn't it surprising that police haven't made this a crime scene? They didn't take any hard drive or any USB stick. I don't get it. Like, anything that would go for clues. I mean, they do that, like, really intensely, and I'm really surprised they don't do that here now. I mean, Peter has still all his laptops upstairs. It's strange, I mean, nobody asked me if she was around or if I saw her and all that. And even if I would be the police, I would maybe go around and maybe interview the people, "Do you know about her, or...?" I didn't hear about any talk. I would hang up pictures all over the place. - "Where did you see this girl last time?" - Mm. Definitely. But there are no cameras where she was supposed to get out. Like, I mean, there are cameras everywhere. Maybe they know more than we know. Yeah. [turn signal clicking] [reporter over radio] Investigators in Denmark say the submarine on which a missing journalist was last seen was sunken deliberately. Police are still questioning the designer and owner of the vessel, Peter Madsen. Here? [reporter] He originally claimed he dropped off Swedish journalist, Kim Wall hours earlier. [Stefan] Oh, shit. I don't know. Somehow, it must sink. - [Emma] What's your best bet? - That the valve was open. That's the easiest way to sink it. [Peter] Okay, we have the main air line coming in here. That's the high pressure air. We have the distributor panel here that makes it possible to blow all the tanks. This is for the main tank, this is what we can all use. [pipes gushing] Cool. [chuckles] This submarine gives us world dominance. We will be able to declare unrestricted submarine warfare against the enemy. - You should try that, yeah? - Yes. They won't know us when we come beneath their launch platform. - And then attack. - [chuckles] [Stefan] Crazy. I mean, every idiot could see, okay, both valves are open. I mean, you don't need to be very smart to see that it was, uh, done intentionally. Like, it could still then, uh, most likely be that something really bad happened on the submarine with those two people on board. [machinery whirring] [yells] Emma? Can you hear me? Can you film the rudder and the propeller? I'm going to spin the rudder. [machinery powering down] [Peter] Everything works. You got to give me a go or no go on that camera, Emma. Did you expect your movie to become a submarine movie as well? - [Emma] I was hoping so. - [chuckles] - That was my first impression of you. - [Peter] You know, it's... The reviewers will say this movie doesn't know what it wants. Either go up or go down. It does both and it's absolutely wrong. [Chuckles] You will not get... What do you call it? The children's rating. - It… t will... - [Emma] PG. Yeah, put bad ideas into children's minds. [Emma] You said… You said it best when you said we don't know if you're gonna go down in history as heroes or criminals. Yeah, actually I said, we will either go into the... into history as the greatest heroes or the greatest criminals. You're gonna die anyway. It's only a matter of how much pain. Your life will end in downfall no matter what you do. - [Stefan] Yeah, yeah. - It accounts for us all. The only thing we can do is to make a little bit of, you know, fun on the way to the downfall, all to make the most spectacular possible downfall. [soldering iron sizzles] [Emma] Today, Nautilus is repaired and she's back in the water. - [chuckles] Emma, you're just eating this. - Yeah. I can see it. You want sound? Yes, please. I've got it in my pocket. We're okay, Allan, we'll put on the chains now. She's going to sea today because she's needed for the battle. She's needed to become the mission control ship of the rocket launch. [Emma] How does it feel, Peter? [Emma] It feels extremely joyful because this is another step past my professional divorce with Copenhagen Suborbitals. It's a very, very big day for the space lab. [in Danish] Her back end will be up high, everybody! [in English] She's gonna have her back-end pretty high, we'll see. [laughter] [in Danish] Right now, we're tilted a bit forward. Too far. Full speed astern. [machinery whirring] [in English] In a submarine, you're safe when you're submerged. [air hissing] You close those hatches, you open the vent valves, and you slip beneath the surface into a silent and peaceful environment. On the Nautilus, I began to realize that everything is possible. That even the most unimaginable dream could be turned into reality, if you decide enough. [ominous music building] [investigator in Danish] In connection with "The Submarine Case" investigation, we'd like to make an announcement to the press. We presume that we're searching for a dead body. We're doing that primarily in the area around Køge Bay on the Danish and the Swedish side. We have no concrete indication as to where we should search… [announcement continues indistinctly] [reporter 1 in English] The owner of a homemade submarine has told Danish police that the missing journalist died in an accident on board and then he buried her at sea… [reporter 2] Now he says that she died and he buried her at sea. There has been an extensive search of the sea to find Kim Wall. She was reported missing by her boyfriend. [Stefan] So that's why he sunk the submarine then. That makes sense then. He thought he can convince everybody with his, uh, with his talk. And so, it will always stay an accident so that we'll never find her. But you could have... At the same time, he could have killed her also. [Emma] Why would you say that? Why would he do that? Yeah, but why… why would he bury her in sea? Why would you do that to somebody? It is the 28th of July, 20 [chuckles] Fif... Six... 17? - [Peter] Another day in paradise. - [Emma chuckles] Yeah. And we are going to launch the launch pad today. [tense music playing] - [Peter] You're not annoying each other? - [Emma] We're getting... - [Peter] Should I have her removed? - No, no, no, no. - [Emma] Correct. - [all chuckle] - Don't mess with Australia, right? - I'm sorry, Emma, we're gonna end it here. I'm being replaced. But I purchased the company that you work for, so actually you work for me now. - [Emma] Oh, do I have a job? - Yeah. - [Emma] Okay. Should I get back to work? - Yeah, yeah. We've got right now about two weeks before the launch. It's a critical day, and God knows if it's gonna work out the way it's supposed to. I've built one other launch pad with Copenhagen Suborbitals. But this one is certainly the most advanced and complex, structurally critical object that I've ever built. I don't mind trucks here as long as they work for us. So what are you doing here? You are commandeered by now, we need you. It's a national priority that Peter gets to space. And stop, we need to rotate. This is wrong. [in Danish] Parallel, my ass! Use your eyes. [Stefan in English] Peter got these people who are hardcore studying engineering. And, as far as I know, Peter has never really finished an engineering class or degree. It is, like, really hard for him to stay organized, make, uh, project planning, keep the time schedule. It's really hard for him to do that. [in Danish] Why am I building this shit when I've done it before? [in English] Fuck me. It's gonna be dark before we are where we should have been early in the afternoon. [Peter cheers] Don't you want to board it? We're not gonna sink. Everything works the way it's supposed to. It's much bigger than, uh, CS. - [Emma] When they gonna launch? - [in Danish] Eeny, meeny, miney, mo. [in English] I don't know. I know that one works, this one is experimental. Yeah. But I also know, in the back of my heart, that no matter what CS may think, that is Peter's design and that is Peter's design. And they may think that it's theirs, they may think it's their idea, they may think whatever the fuck they want, But at the end of the day, those two ships have one father. [man] Yeah. [Peter] But, uh, we spent way too much money today. [helicopter whirring] So, um, just south of Copenhagen a woman's torso has been found. Um… [smacks lips] Uh, in the same bay area where Peter was discovered with his submarine. Uh, so there'll be probably another announcement by the police. New information about the mysterious disappearance of a Swedish journalist, her name is Kim Wall, in what one major newspaper is calling "the most spectacular murder case in Danish history." Now to a bizarre murder mystery worthy of its own Scandinavian crime drama. [in French] The mystery surrounding the inventor of the Nautilus [reporter 1 in German] Peter Madsen is known all over Denmark, inventor and tinkerer. [reporter 2 in English] Madsen is a well-known figure in Denmark. The case has shocked the country. [reporter 3] A journalist who loved to tell fascinating stories, now at the center of her own bizarre mystery. [reporter 4 in Danish] Peter Madsen claims that her death was an accident and that he subsequently dumped her body in the sea. [investigator on screen] Good morning. I would like to express my sympathies to Kim Wall's relatives. Last night, I had to relay to them that we have a DNA match between Kim Wall and the torso that was found. Regarding the autopsy, I can add that it would seem that there are damages to the torso. They seem to have been deliberately inflicted to make sure that air and gasses would leave the body to prevent it from drifting or floating up from the seabed. Metal has been fastened to the body, presumably to ensure that it would sink to the bottom. [reporter 5 in English] Divers and rescue workers have been searching waters near where the corpse was found, but no further remains have been discovered. [reporter 6] Danish prosecutors investigating the death of Kim Wall say they'll seek a murder charge against the man police are holding in custody. [Emma] Do you think he did it? Murdered her? Think it was an accident? [Stefan] I still hope it was an accident but if you see the facts, I mean, no, it was no accident. He wanted to try it, how it feels to… Yeah, remove somebody's life. We literally walked the area to see if we could find her, if we could find Kim. And we basically searched all the area. Uh, bushes, shrubberies. Hoping, if you could put it that way, that… that either we would find her with a broken leg or whatever. I… um… But of course, we… we never did, for obvious reasons. Um… The whole story that he had… he had told, the whole explanation that we were told through the media, were… were just utter lies. It's just. I still don't get it, I... - [Emma] No. - I still don't get it. This is a person that's been in my house, right? This is a person that's… that I've shared my private life with. This is a person that I utterly trusted. I… [sighs] [sighs] Yeah. On… On Saturday he was… he was part of our birthday celebrations, and then he goes out and does this on the Thursday. [scoffs] It's just… [grunts] Ah… I [Sara] I still don't want to see Peter as an evil person. I hope to God that it was a panic, but the way he did it, it's not, uh, a panic reaction. Kind of calculated to cut off her limbs and then press air out of the lungs, tying metal to the torso to try to make it sink. As my neighbor said, "The ocean, she wouldn't keep the secret." But then, am I actually crazy for not seeing this coming? Were there signs I didn't notice? The message he texted me, was that actually something where he described that he was going to do? [Emma] What was the message? He texted me something funny, but it was, like, just for fun. I… I almost don't want to say because, like, it's so difficult not to misunderstand it. [ominous music playing] It was in the context that I wanted to be threatened by Peter because I couldn't get on with my work, and I was like, "Peter, you have to write threatening texts to me so I can, like, get on with my work." So he was writing, "I'm gonna tie you up in the submarine if you don't do it." Then, "I have a plan of murder as a big entertainment." "We're gonna make a movie with you and you will have no choice." He say, "Now we're gonna cut you into pieces." This is so fucked up. [music builds, halts] Is there a light on it? Indicating that it should. Exposure auto, press manual. [Peter] At that point, you swing this one around, and you close this door. Then it's shooting to its heart's content. You open the door. You'll see that it's shooting. Right down on the bed. And she says, "Is that a camera?" I said, "Yes, it's a camera, but, uh, you've gotta look at that in perspective "of likelihood." We're in here. It takes two. [ominous music playing] [reporter] Swedish journalist Kim Wall died when she was accidentally hit by a heavy hatch cover on board a homemade submarine. He said he had been holding the hatch for her, but it slipped and hit her on the head. [overlapping announcements] [reporter 2] Madsen's skull fracture explanation is impossible to verify as the search continues for the rest of Kim Wall's remains. Legal experts say that if prosecution still lacks hard evidence and a motive at the time of trial, Madsen could theoretically be released. From an evidence point of view, from a police point of view, they need to find a crucial part of the evidence that could say no. She didn't get hit in her head with… with, uh, with the hatch. That's it. This wasn't an accident. I… It… It wasn't. So stop calling it an accident. It's just… I… I can't see it being an accident. He came up with different versions of the story as… as different evidence was presented. Well, I guess he had everybody fooled. [interviewer] When this happens, when you go up in your rocket, what do you expect the world to say? What do you expect's gonna happen? "Holy cow." [chuckles] That's what I'm expecting people to say. That's very dangerous. [interviewer] …get some police contracts after this? [Peter] The thing is, it's been a side job of mine ever since I was a little boy to spoof authorities, to make them believe that nothing is wrong and then act. Uh, from the first moment when a smoke plume came out of the workshop at home and I had to deal with my first authority in my life, my… my dad, I had to convince him that that was not black powder burning. He gave me a wonderful training in spoofing authorities and making them not understanding what's happening. Until it's too late. [ominous music playing] - [Emma] Were you questioned by the police? - [man 1] Yeah. [Emma] What was the line of questioning that you had? [man 1] They asked a lot about the submarine and especially about tools. [Emma] Mine went along similar lines to that, but they were really interested in the footage we filmed on the 10th. - [man 1] Yeah. - Which was the day he went out with Kim. [man 1] Yeah. [Emma] But I'm worried that they don't have much on him at the moment to pin him for homicide, as opposed to manslaughter. And on a few technicalities, he can walk away. [man 1] There's so many points now against him. I mean, he said it was... That she got hit by the hatch. - [Emma] Is it possible? - [man 1] It makes no sense. And the strange thing was that he didn't allow that, um, the police can have access to his computer. - [man 1] He didn't? - [Stefan] Did you hear that? - [Emma] Yeah, what was that? - [overlapping responses] [Emma] And at some point in the afternoon, somebody saw him carrying a saw. Yeah. Is it called a hacksaw? - Um, with an orange handle and... - [man 2] Hacksaw or wood saw? - Wood saw, I think. - [man 2] Okay. [Emma] Why would you bring a wood saw onto a steel submarine? [man 1] Exactly. It doesn't make sense at all. [Emma] Did they ask you about the women in the workshop or anything like that? Oh, they asked that actually, if I've seen her, Kim Wall, in the workshop, and I haven't. Um, and if I've heard Peter talked about her and I haven't. Uh. I didn't even know of her before the next day. But I mean, if he planned this, then he were maybe just planning the next person or the next woman. "Who I have alone in the submarine when I get the chance to do this, I'm gonna do it." So the police might not find a specific reason for it being her. It could just be that she was the first opportunity he had. [Emma] He talked to me that week about if I got in the submarine with him. Mm. [Emma] He didn't invite men on to that submarine, but there was a selection of women that he invited. And wasn't it that he sent you a message on the 10th saying, "Let's go out on the submarine tomorrow"? [Sara] Yeah. He just said that, "Nautilus is sailing so beautifully, let's take a ride the next day." It was Kim who was insisting on doing it that night. So she just went on. [Emma] You have two interns injured. One burned, one with a sprain or something. [Peter] Burnt feet, broken legs, lacerations, a sick cat, a truck driver that's too busy. Christmas is cancel led. Winter is coming. [frying pan scrapes] And I'm going to kill someone with a spoon. I will select the person to be killed by chance. [in Danish] Betrayal. Now when you're a grown-up, you must get used to a new phenomenon: 'Betrayal'. You will be betrayed. You will be trampled on and forced down. [woman] I get my driver's license on the tenth. - That's great. - Yeah. - [Emma in English] You talking about me? - Yeah, we're talking about you. Yeah. - We're gonna hack you to death. - [gasps] [Emma] That's a bit rough. No, hugging you is... That's a... - You said 'hug'? - Hug? That's so much nicer than hack. - [Emma chuckles] - We're not gonna hack you to death. You… You heard me saying hack, but I did say hug. - [Emma] Yeah. - And we don't use hammers for hugging. [chuckles] That would be a little bit rude. You'll be pressed towards the soft belly skin of a cat. With no escape possible. You just have to enjoy it. You're not filming me cooking in the workshop, are you? - [Emma] Yeah. - I know you are. It's not going into the movie. [Emma] No. [Peter] It's not going into the... I know you want it. I know. Course you are, it's a perfect shot. [ominous music playing] [Peter] Today, uh, is the day when we try a sort of simulated launch operation. We wanna tow the platform and see we can have it under control with the submarine. I'm very excited about how this whole thing is gonna work out. Stefan, can you take a line from the, uh, new platform? - [Stefan] Yeah, yeah. - Cool. [Stefan] Oh, those amateurs. - [Emma] Is there a plan here? - No, never. Have you ever seen a plan? You can just give the rope to me, because I can pull it taut… taut to me. Huh? Up or… [man] Yeah, but we're scraping the quayside. [Stefan] Oh, fuck me. The nut down there is completely loose. - [Emma] Are you kidding me? - Yeah. [Stefan chats indistinctly] [Emma] So all the bolts are rattling loose? I mean, I think he needs to take it out tomorrow otherwise it will fall apart. - [Emma] Really? - Yeah, yeah. I don't even know if we can afford to launch this year. - [Peter in Danish] Thanks. Great sailing. - At least we didn't put any dents in it. It was amazing. Did you identify the error? Not interested. - A technician can take a look. - [indistinct response] We're doing some TV. It'll only take 30 seconds. [in English] Rolling. Whoa, we're back ashore now, and everything we tried went well. We have been, uh, towing the platform, we've been tilting it up to almost ten degrees, I think. It was like going... It was literally the Titanic going down. It worked very well. And, um, we've been towing the platform first with the electric motor. We now know that we can do 1.7 knots like that, which is beautiful for the launch. [Emma] So there were no hiccups or anything along the way... As… as soon as you went... That... No, that worked perfectly. She's just in an excellent mood. [Emma] Because in seven or eight days, we're taking her out to Bornholm to prepare for the rocket launch. Well, according to- I don't know what date it is today, but I know that on the 11th we're going to Bornholm. So there's, um, a lot of tension on that. We'll see how that works out. I guess I'll be in despair in the beginning of the day, then it'll get better, and I'll be happy. [Stefan] Talking to Peter, like, it felt like, wow, you… you really can trust this guy. But in reality, you learned over time that he's actually a great liar. There are many people out there with lots of money that believe him. Initially, he… he even said he was gonna launch three rockets this year. So now he only have maybe… maybe only one, yeah. [Emma] But the big news now is that Peter and CS have chosen the same place and time to launch both their separate rockets. So the Copenhagen space race has now reached fever pitch. I mean, he has not much resources left, so he has not many ways to go right now. [reporter] Authorities have been unable to locate the cell phones of either Kim Wall or Peter Madsen, and the police are working to access the computer that was found in Madsen's workshop. [Emma] You had a strange encounter with Peter the day before Kim Wall was killed. [Stefan] That was a weird situation. We were just talking about something, and then suddenly, he said about a website. It's like a website, where you can see about victims from murder scenes, how they look like after. Um, such, uh, things. Um, and he was talking about it and he asked me if I know the website. I just said, "Okay, what the heck are you talking about?" And that was just out of nowhere, he just said that and, um… Well, sometimes, um, he was talking about… Well, in the past, like, he always talks about, "Oh, machine guns and cannons," and, "Oh, we wanna shoot two people and blah, blah," but it was more in a funny way and not like that he wanna see somebody, um like, dying in front of him. [ominous music playing] [Stefan] But, um, the police have found such evidence on his hard drive. That's something what I have not expected from him. That's something that surprised me, I must say that. [reporter] Danish prosecutors have revealed, uh, new details on the murder of Swedish journalist Kim Wall. Videos of the torture and murder of women on Madsen's computer. [reporter 2] A hard drive was seized in his workshop with fetish films showing women being tortured, decapitated, and even burned alive. The engineer says, the drive wasn't his. [camera shutters clicking] [investigator in Danish] Good morning. We'd like to give you an update on the "submarine case" investigation. We've conducted multiple dives on Thursday and Friday in Køge Bay. Yesterday morning, we first found a bag in which we found Kim Wall's clothes, a shirt, a skirt, socks, and shoes. There was also a knife and lead weights to weigh the bag down. Around midday, we found one leg and then another leg. Shortly thereafter, we found a head lying in a bag that was weighed down with several pieces of metal. There's no sign of fracture to the skull and no sign of any other blunt trauma to the skull. [in English] They found the head, and the legs, and the head had no, uh, physical damage, um, from the hatch. Because, like, Peter was talking, saying that the hatch was hitting her head and then she had an open skull, or something like that. But, um, yeah, that was not the case when they found the head. So, um, that means that Peter lied again. [melancholic music playing] [reporter 1] Madsen changed his story again. [reporter 2] Madsen now says she suffered carbon monoxide poisoning. [reporter 3] …carbon monoxide poisoning. He admits however, to dismembering her body and throwing it overboard. [reporter 4] Investigators believe this was a sadistic sex crime. He tied Wall up and tortured her before killing her. They also believe it was premeditated. [Sara] I feel like the ghost of Kim is angry at me and she's hating me for being friends with Peter. And how dare I be friends with a monster like that without even warning the world about it. I'm so naive. [Emma] Why? [Sara] I don't know, I think I was being manipulated by him. And it's more and more obvious that it was maybe supposed to be me on the sub. I was supposed to ride the submarine with him the next day. [Emma] If you'd gone on the submarine with him, would you have felt safe? Yeah. Of course. [Emma] Why? Because it's my friend. [indistinct chatter] [Emma] Space lab is quiet. Looks like nobody showed up. So I guess today RML might be a one-man space program? [Peter] It's not supposed to be that. I need people to be around in order to get things done. But there's nobody here. It's a tragic, stupid, absurd, counter intuitive, crazy thing. People came to this island to help Peter build his rocket and go to space. So what are they doing? Are they helping? What's the fucking point? [Stefan] I think he always wanted to be a dictator or somehow. And he wanted to control people. But the interns, they left. And I got de-motivated. He couldn't keep people together, he couldn't control them because he had no power to do that. And how can you have the most power? Cause… pain to somebody. I have a saying. In all of your life's most important moments, you're all alone. You are all alone when you get born, and you're all alone when you die. You're all alone at the end of the day in the most important moments in your life. [reporter 1] News coming from Copenhagen. The Danish man accused of murdering a female journalist aboard his homemade submarine is on trial in the city. [reporter 2] Danish prosecutors are seeking a life sentence for inventor, Peter Madsen. And his lawyers have focused on the fact that there is no forensic evidence to disprove his version of events. [reporter 3] Madsen pleading not guilty… [reporter 4] They were arguing for a six-month sentence of dismembering a body. [indistinct announcement] [reporter 5] The indictment charges Madsen with premeditated murder, and indecent handling of a corpse, as well as sexual relations other than intercourse of a particularly dangerous nature. That legal language obscures the brutality of the alleged crime. [reporter 6] The problem is that there were only two people aboard the submarine, and only they know what happened inside. [reporter 7] What really happened? Prosecutors say they will reveal details in court to prove how Madsen planned to commit the murder and dispose of the body. The trial is expected to last to the end of April. [Emma] The first day of the trial's today. - Mm. - I got an email from the police saying I'm gonna be a witness in the case. [Sara] Well, right now, I'm working on not even getting into the court, because of the presence... because of Peter's presence in the courtroom. Yeah. Because I get really bad anxiety every time I know there is a lot of details. [inhales sharply] Because the details makes it more realistic to me, and… and… And the fact that, um, you… you, all of a sudden, have realistic pictures in your head. Um… Oh shit, sorry. I just… I just get, like, this weird, yeah, Peter anxiety, this is Peter anxiety. Uh… - [Emma] You never know when it'll come up? - No, but it... I just know I... We I'm gonna have, like, panic attacks, like, 15 times this month, I just know. [sniffs] And everybody will call one another and, like… And, you know, all those messages, like, saying, like, "Just so you know, I'm here. I will be here for you," and you just know shit is going down. Or something has happened when people write that. Like, "Are you okay?" and, like, "What… what has now happened?" You know? [sighs] Okay. Okay, let's read the messages. - Um, let's read the headlines. - [Emma] What's happening in the trial? Uh, the prosecutor is saying to the trial that there will be a lot of, like, really, really, um, violent pictures, detailed pictures. They're saying on his computer there is, like, films, um, of executions. And, uh, 8:20, before he sailed with Kim, he googled "beheading," "agony," and "pain," and… [in Danish] The video shows a young, unknown woman rattling while her throat is being cut. [in English] A video that shows a young woman dying because she's getting cut in her throat up. [Emma] On the 10th of August? [Sara] 8:23 a.m. Whoa. That's… That's... Yeah. That's… a little while before we showed up to film. I think that would've been around the time I messaged him to say we're on our way. And then he writes to me, "Nothing much is happening today, but yeah, sure, come round." [ominous music playing] [Peter] What's gonna happen now? Are they coming or not? - [Emma] They should be. - Okay. [Emma] Something's bugging me. I had you put it on that side, but actually I want it up on this side.. Mm. Mm. [Emma] Okay, can I do all things? Yes. You can. - Oh no, it was better on that side. - Mm-hmm. Okay. Multi-tasking. - Yeah, yeah. - Okay. [Peter] Yeah. They… They tell that they, um, about the saw is seen on footage you shot. Um, there is… [Sara] The saw with the orange handle, it can be seen on the footage. [Emma] Yeah. The saw was on the back wall. The next day, when we're all looking for him and we were in the workshop, the one with the orange handle was gone. And at one point, I saw him texting. That must have been him texting you, inviting you on to the sub. [engine rumbling] [indistinct chatter] [Emma] Let's just wait for the motorbike to go past. - [sighs] - We'll have a bit of noise here and there. But what's going on? Oh. Oh, what's going on? Uh, we are now on the 10th of August, 2017. And we have reserved the 26th, 27th weekend for rocket launch in the Baltic and we have reserved the 2nd and 3rd of September for rocket launch. And, uh, our friends at Copenhagen Suborbitals, my old company, have reserved the same dates. I cannot really put words to… to make you understand how very pitched this whole affair with Peter and his, uh, earlier project is. The way it is right now, I'm cancelling the Friday ride on the submarine, postponing it until A, they've flown their rocket and B, that we've got money. - Break. - [Emma] Break. I'm trying to find out what's happening in the back. Oh, yeah, there's I don't like when the door's open. Oh, that's Bjarke. Everything okay? No, uh, can't find the key to the submarine. It's in my... Oh, there are several of them hanging in there. It's called UC3. So the prosecutor wants to know why Peter said that Kim died getting the hatch on the head, and… and waited two months to tell something else. Things change. And then he answers that.. You have to pull down the curtains. Stop telling people about what you're thinking, stop sharing. "I'm holding my explanation until I'm forced to tell which way she died." [Peter] Imagine you're in the courtroom. "Could you tell us what you were doing on Thursday the 27th of April 2016, at 21:00 hours in the evening?" He's actually confessing that he's keeping the truth. This is absurd. [Peter] When you are asked in the courtroom, "Could you tell us what you were doing at a certain time and a certain position?" Uh, the reason for that question is not being curious. It's about if you answer that question and you are saying, "Yes, I was in the process of murdering my neighbor's wife," or something… [chuckles] You know, if you had to be honest. I mean, if you are under… under 'siege', if you are... What do you call it? Accused. You shouldn't say anything. Why would I want to be open to people who are interrogating me? Hell no. I have the right to remain silent, and everything I say and do can and will be used against me in the ruling... You know, in the court of… of law. It's basically the situation. So I shut up. I have to learn to shut up. I have to learn the word secrecy. Okay, um, we've elaborated a lot on… on this conflict stuff. I need the place to be... Okay. Bjarke? Uh, did you get…? [in Danish] You're going into the submarine with the drying machine and the bottle, right? [Bjarke] Yeah. [Peter] And take the day off Friday. [Bjarke in English] What? - [in Danish] Why? - [Peter] Uh… [in English] We'll see, uh, the precise way of it. But, you know, I'm not trained as, you know, a lot of military people who knows to shut up. [Emma] Peter was holding a big metal pipe. He said he needed to fix something. - Yeah, okay. - [Bjarke shouts indistinctly] - I'm gonna have to make this for Alex... - [Emma] You do that stuff. I've just gotta work out, like, probably come back a couple of days next week... [Peter] Oh yeah, now this gets funny. I know where your telephone is, do you know where mine is? [Emma] Only four minutes later, his phone rang. He answered and went outside. Later, when we wave goodbye to him, he was just off the phone. Apparently that was to Kim. She was moving to Beijing in a few days, but she wanted this interview with him. And he invited her out on the sub. She was having her going-away party that night, but skipped it to get her story. And when she was saying goodbye to her friends, that's when Peter must have put the tools on the sub. [Sara] So they left Refshaleøen at 7:20, and these last four messages from Kim to her boyfriend was, "I'm still alive, by the way, but going down now. I love you." "He bought coffee and cookies too." [sobbing] "I'm still alive, by the way, but going down now. I love you." [gushing] [man in Danish over radio] Nautilus? Nautilus? Can you hear me? [woman in English] Peter, are you okay? You okay? [in Danish] I think her name was Kim. I don't check journalists' backgrounds. [indistinct overlapping chatter] [Peter] There was no one else but me on board. [Emma in English] I understand why you'd be scared to see him in court. But what happened down there, it's so similar to the text message that you got. It's too similar. The cause of death is inconclusive. If they can't prove that he murdered her, and that's still a likely scenario... [Sara] But he said he dismembered her. Yeah, so that's desecration of a corpse. Shit. [Emma] And that's a much lighter sentence. So this trial hasn't been won yet. What you have to say might be pretty significant. [inhales] I have to call the police. My last conversation with Peter is on August 10th and I can tell you the exact time because it's 6:48 p.m. And, as I understand it, this is now 12 minutes before he takes Nautilus and Kim Wall out for the last… for the last sailing, for the last trip. That… That time stamp will always follow me. - Um… - [Emma] Why? Because there was nothing in his voice that even indicated anything. Nothing. It could have been just any ordinary conversation he and I had. Um… Yeah. Yeah. [melancholic music playing] [reporter] Peter Madsen has pleaded 'not guilty' to murdering a Swedish journalist on his submarine, but has admitted to dismembering her body. He grinned as he told the court that he doesn't see how it matters, because she was already dead. [Emma] Peter Madsen's testimony the second day of the trial, he turned the trial into a bit of a circus. Anyone that he could pull down, he was pulling down with him. Creating suspicions around the young people that have been helping him. Peter said that the interns, um, put some stuff on his computer, and there is especially one intern who lived at his workshop, um, also had access to it, and, uh, obviously that was me. In the end, he just doesn't care about people, he just wanna rescue his own. I just totally lost all the good memories at that point. Why… Why are you doing this? I mean… And now, I really wanna try the best I can do to support Kim Wall to get justice. [tense music playing] [reporter 1] The submarine case continues today with testimony from interns and volunteers of Peter Madsen's space lab. I'm gonna see him today. And then I'm not gonna see him again. [reporter 2] The witness said he had not seen those tools on the submarine before, and there was no plausible reason for them to be on the submarine. [reporter 3] A witness said that he didn't have access to Peter Madsen's computer, but Madsen had told him there was offensive content on it. [Sara] The Peter that I knew died. So this is a sorrow I'm going through. [reporter 4] Today, the court will hear from an unnamed witness who will testify behind closed doors. [reporter 5] In the closing argument, the prosecution said that Peter Madsen had written a text message describing a murder plan. Madsen had deleted it from his phone, but police were able to recover it from another source. The verdict is expected in two days. [Sara] It's one of the hardest things I've ever had to do, but it's important. Because I owe this to Kim's family. You start thinking really, really dark thoughts about yourself and about your own existence. Because, you… you… You are the ones that need to know that he could... He was able to do that. You… You have to tell the whole world that you saw the whole thing, you knew that the whole thing. And I have even more shame because I got the fucking text. In Danish we have this expression saying that you can silence somebody to death. You can in a way, like, just... If you don't talk about it, it won't exist. But some of the truth of the story will lose if the stories of the ones left behind are not being told. [Christoffer] I don't regret standing by Peter's side the first few days. What else should I do? I… I trusted the friendship with Peter, the values that I believed he carried. [Stefan] Where would you find a place where somebody is working on a submarine or a rocket? People just joined because it was so cool to work with Peter. I was proud to talk about him. Now you just try to avoid it. [Stefan] My family and my friends, they said, "Why have you been part of that and are you also like this, and didn't you know about this?" It's hard to explain to somebody else who was not there at the time when everything seemed to be good. I just leave. The place will never see me again. Yeah. And I hope that it's gonna work out for me and for the people here. Yeah. That's it then. [in Danish] Will you appeal if the verdict goes against you? No comment. [indistinct chatter] [in English] Yeah. - [Christoffer] Time is it now? - [Emma] It's one. - It's one. - So the verdict's being read now. [judge in Danish] The court pronounces sentence in the case. The court finds that Peter L. Madsen shall be sentenced to life imprisonment. - [Christoffer] Life sentence. - [Emma] Life sentence. Oh, I need… You know what, Emma? I need a hug. Fucking hell. [representative in Danish] Kim Wall was an innocent victim. This wasn't a premeditated killing of Kim Wall, but a premeditated killing of the next woman who would accompany him alone to sail in this submarine. [in English] The Peter I knew for ten years, the Peter that went on the submarine on August 10th and came up on August 11th, that's two different people. Very different people. Um… Yeah, it's… It's… It's... I find it. I find it scary that we, as human beings, can have this duality in us. But I find it equally scary that I didn't see it. Um… The only consolation I have here is that nobody else saw it as well. [Peter] Hi. Four, three, two, one, zero. [Emma] Liftoff. Let that be everything I have to say about the man. [Emma] Yeah, we've got that conversation out of the way. - Yeah. - All right. - Okay. - Um.. And that's a chapter we don't need to revisit. No, but now we know it's there. And I can tell you, and no compassion, I've been very honest in this. And I've been a little bit too open maybe, but… Um… One perspective would be… And this is as much me just asking you as… as ordinary people. You're aware of the fact maybe that psychopaths exist amongst us. Human predators that walk around and grabs people, and use them, throw them out, used, and maybe stalk them afterwards and so on. There are human predators amongst us. And psychopathic people are often very charismatic, they are excellent speakers, they're convincing. They are having illusions of… of self-grandeur. And have no regard for anyone else. And he will try really to punish those people who have been under his spell, he will try to punish them afterwards by stalking them, by talking badly about them, all these things. There is the possibility that you've simply come upon a human predator. And I wouldn't know. Because do the psychopath know that he's a psychopath? I'm not sure. [emotional music playing]
