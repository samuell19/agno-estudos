[tense music] - [Man On Radio] And President Reagan fully endorsed a major new departure in strategic doctrine. A plan to put 100 giant MX missiles in existing Minuteman silos. [chattering on radio] [tires squeal] - Help me. - What we know is her husband's a Quantico cop with Marine Security Battalion. - [Man] Move back! - Jill, I'm Special Agent Leino with the Naval Investigative Service. I need you to tell me what happened tonight. - My husband was on night duty. I was alone and someone called and said they were an MP and Spencer was hurt in an accident. They said they were sending someone to take me to the hospital. We drove to the woods, pulled over. I tried to get out. He had a knife. He raped me. - What did he look like? Help us, ma'am. Tell us what he looked like. - Black man. - [Leino] What else, Jill? - [Jill] He wore glasses. - There's only one black guy in the military police. Sounds like Scotty. [upbeat brass music] - Scotty! I need to speak to you ASAP. - Yes, Sergeant? Something wrong? - A woman was raped last night. Stabbed, left for dead. - Who? - Spencer Ames' wife. Well, you know Spencer, don't you? - I trained with him. We used to carpool. He lived in my complex. - Well, we're searching what appears to be the crime scene now. - What did this guy look like? - It was a black guy, glasses. Jill says he called and identified himself as a military policeman who works with Spencer. - I'm the only black man in MP. - Naval investigators would like to speak to you, Scotty. Get in. [subdued music] [engine starts] - I'm here with Lori Jackson, head of the Women for Equal Social Justice, who has just won her civil lawsuit against the owner of a local diner who is refusing to serve blacks. Ms. Jackson marched with Dr. King and continues the crusade. Ms. Jackson, any further comments you'd like to make? - Yes, I would. This is not just about a local diner. I want the people out there to understand that this is the 80's. And if they think we're not paying attention to what's going on, they're wrong. They think they can hide and continue the same old prejudiced ways, but I want them to know we're gonna find them, we're gonna smoke them out, we're gonna sue them in every court in this land, and we're gonna win. - [Reporter] That was Lori Jackson of Women for Equal Social Justice. Now, back to Jim in the studio. - Maybe she can help us with our organization. [phone ringing] Hello? Yes, he is. Just a moment. It's the military police again. - Hello? Yes, this is Lindsey Scott. I'm here. - I hate those damn calls. You've never violated your house arrest. Why they gotta be calling you every five times a day? - It's just procedure, Lola. It's the way the system works. - All right, Dena baby. What do you think? - You look beautiful, Mama. - Teresa? - I think you should've gotten a new dress. That old thing smells like moth balls. - Thanks a lot, honey. - Just giving my opinion. - Aunt Lily. - Oh, look at you. You're beautiful. - And you're looking good. Always will. - I got something for you. - No. - Mm-hmm. Look at this. - That's Cousin Terry's good luck charm. I didn't know we still had it. - I'd never lose this. He loved it. You were his little minnow. And I know he'd want you to wear it, dear. You're getting too old to be getting married anymore, so I just figured it might help. [both laugh] Of course, now you know I've been looking for a new man for 40 years and it ain't done me no good. [both laugh] - Thank you. - Yes, baby. Now, where's my Dena and Teresa? Come on over here and give your old aunt a kiss. [subdued music] [woman crying] [bell ringing] ["Wedding March" playing on organ] [soft guitar music] - What are you doing? - Just following tradition, darling. Over the threshold. Whoa. It's gonna be a little crowded in here when I get all my stuff in. - [Lori] Oh, we'll manage. - I promise you one thing. - What's that? - We're gonna have that little cabin in the woods you've always been dreaming about. - You mean like a little house? - Yes, ma'am. - Something we can all move into? - Yes, and we will make love all night long. - Teresa? Teresa? You know what time to pick up Dena from school and don't forget the PTA meeting on Thursday night. Now, if the people from the NAACP call, give them the number at the hotel. And Aunt Lily's in charge of all emergencies. I don't know how I'm gonna get everything done. - I've got two jobs to worry about. If I can take time off for a week, so can you. - I'm trying, I'm trying. Believe me. You know how much I'm looking forward to this trip? - Mama, you're not leaving for two more days and you're already packed? - Ain't nothing wrong with being organized. Now, you're gonna water all the plants and don't you and your sister eat that sugar cereal all day long. - Don't worry about us. [door opens] - Here's the mail, Mama. Looks like somebody had a lot to say. - Thanks, baby. [subdued music] Now, tell me what you were doing the day of the assault. - Well, I finished cleaning the apartment and then I went to Dumphrey's Drug Store and bought my wife a foot massager for her birthday. I wanted to get her something else, so I drove to Zayre's on Woodbridge, it's about 20 miles away, to look. I didn't find anything. - Now, you said something in your letter about buying a Coke. - Yeah, from some white counter girl. Her friend called her Pam. Now, I told my lawyer, but he said since the NIS had already talked to her. - [Lori] NIS? - The Naval Investigative Services. - [Lori] I see. - Since they had already talked to her, and she didn't recognize my picture, there was nothing he could do. - But, you can't prove you were at Zayre's? - No, ma'am. - What does your lawyer think? - Mr. Kuhnke? [scoffs] He says we have nothing to worry about because they have no evidence. But, he's not the one on trial. - Mm-mm. - You also said that you wanted me to contact a Lieutenant Colonel... - Colonel Harry. Here's his address, his phone number. You can talk to him. And this here is from the Article 32 hearing. It's like the military grand jury hearing. - Corporal Scott, I'm an activist. I'm not an investigator or an attorney. I've picketed, I've marched, I've filed suits, but this is a whole new ballgame. I'll take a look at it. - My court martial's in two weeks. - I'll read it, but no promises. - [Lindsey] You're the only one I heard from. - Excuse me? - I wrote 25 letters and you're the only one who took the time to see us. Mrs. Jackson, thank you. [bell dinging] - [Man] How are you doing today? - Fine. I'm looking for Lieutenant Colonel Richard Harry. I believe he owns this place. - And you are? - Lori Jackson. Lindsey Scott suggested I speak to Colonel Harry. - All right, I'm Harry. I was a military trial magistrate. It was my job to determine if there was sufficient evidence to charge him. - And? - They had nothing. They even had the FBI do two lab tests. Nothing. No forensic evidence, nothing to link him to the crime in any way at all. He didn't have a rock-solid alibi, but without any evidence I didn't think it mattered. - Why did it go ahead? - I ordered him released. The next day I was retired early. Command influence. - What does that mean? - What that means is that his superiors determine his fate. If they think you're guilty, then by Heaven you are going down. And by his actions, a base commander sent a very clear message to any future members of the court. You find him guilty. - [gasps] How could I forget? Our first rally together. - Mm-hmm. - And not just our first rally. - What is all this? - [Lori] Hmm? - What's this? This here? - Oh. Oh, I met with that young guy Lindsey Scott. I spent the last hour reading his court transcript. - Oh, no. I know that look. Listen, that look stays in Virginia 'cause they don't allow that look in Hawaii. - They are looking to railroad this guy. They want to send him right into Leavenworth for the rest of his life for something he didn't do. - Well, maybe he did. - I don't think so. Paul, Paul. - I know. - No. - No, just let... - This is a lynch mob. - This is not some local yokel who's refusing to get with integration. This is the United States Marine Corps you're gonna be taking on. You know, the whole United States Marine Corps. - Mm-hmm. - You take on one, you take on all. Semper Fi. - I gotta do it. [soft music] - I guess Hawaii will still be there in two weeks. - Oh. Thank you. Mr. Kuhnke? - Mrs. Jackson, it's a pleasure to meet you. Please. Now, what is it I can do for you? - Well, actually, Mr. Kuhnke, you can help me. Now, I've been goin through this Article 32 transcript and I'm finding some things a bit confusing. - Well, that's what I'm here for, honey. Now, why don't you tell me what it is that's agitating ya. - Well, if this woman knew that Lindsey Scott lived in her building, why didn't she identify him by name? And the gold tooth. She said she never noticed it. Well, I noticed it the first five seconds after I met him. And she picked two men out of the lineup? - Mrs. Jackson, this is what I've been trying to make Lindsey understand. This is an open-and-shut case. I mean, there's no evidence linking Lindsey to the crime. I mean, they can't even establish a crime scene. And this Jill Ames woman, as you noted, she picked two men out of the lineup. - Well, I understand that, Mr. Kuhnke. But, it seems that... - Mrs. Jackson, I don't think there's anything more you can do that we're not already doing for Corporal Scott. And, quite simply, there is no money to pay you for your time. - Mr. Kuhnke, I'm not talking money. I'm volunteering my time. - Well, that's very generous of you. What exactly is it you want to do? - Well, continue what I started. Talking to people, retracing his steps. I want to talk to that soda girl at Zayre's. - You're wasting your time, honey. The NIS has already interviewed her. - Well, it is my time to waste, Mr. Kuhnke. One more thing. I talked to the manager at Hardee's where Jill Ames works. - You did? - I did. Did you know that she worked with other black men who also fit that description? And the NIS did not question them. - Well, they're pretty thorough, honey. I'm sure they'll get around to it. - You know, Mr. Kuhnke. There is another point of confusion for me. - And what's that? - Aren't they on the other side, honey? - Hi, Mama. - Hi, baby. - Hi, Dad. [typewriter clacking] Yuck. - Your fingers are dirty. - Sorry. He looks guilty. - That is going to give you pimples. - Thanks, Mom. I sure need the extra pressure. - What do you mean he looks guilty? - I don't know. He just looks like he'd do something bad. - Based on what? His look, his tooth? What? - He just looks ghetto, you know? Sinister. Dark and evil. - I don't believe you sometimes. - [Teresa] Why not? - Color does not define who a person is. Well, look at you. You're light-skinned and nasty. And worse than that, you're judgemental. Ghetto, sinister. [typewriter clacking] Mr. Kuhnke. - I was just leaving. I have an appointment at the courthouse. I really don't have time. - But, I've got some color photos of Lindsey. I showed 'em to the soda girl at Zayre's, she recognized him. She said she remembers selling him a Coke. - Did she remember the exact day? - Well, she said the end of April. - It's got to be April 20th. If it's a day sooner or a day later, it's no good. - But, don't you think you should just talk to her? - Honey, you worry too much. I already told ya. There's no evidence. This case is in the bag. - [Woman on PA] Attention, shoppers. For the next 15 minutes we'll be giving triple value on all store coupons. That's right. Three times the value on any store coupons in the next 15 minutes. [knocking on door] - [Woman] Can I help you? - Ms. Hills? - Yes? - Hi. My name is Lori Jackson and I'm here on behalf of a young man who's been accused of rape and attempted murder. - Uh-huh. - Now, he claims that he was in this store at the time the crime took place and I was hoping you could verify that. - I see. - I spoke to your supervisor and he said that you were working the night of April 20th. - Well, if my supervisor said so, I guess I was. - [Lori] Do you remember seeing that man? - Yeah, I've seen this guy. - You remember him? - Yeah, I remember him because we don't get that many black clientele in this store and the ones that we do get are our regular customers. I thought he might be a shoplifter, so I kept my eye on him. But, when I saw that he wasn't going to do anything, I stopped watching. - Do you remember seeing him the night of April 20th? - April 20th? Well, that was a long time ago. At least six months. I can't remember the exact day. Was it that night? I couldn't testify to it. You should've come and seen me that week. - Sister, you're right. Somebody should've contacted you. That's true. - Of course. - Records. What about records? You must keep like store logs or video tapes from the... - Oh, no. We don't keep surveillance video. We take photos of the people we bust, but like I said, I did not bust him, I just kept my eye on him. - Would you mind if I had Mr. Scott's attorney contact you? - Well, ma'am. He can call me, but I cannot testify to anything unless I'm sure. I can't purger myself. - I would never ask you to do that. - Okay. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Thank you very much. We'll be in contact with you. - [Hills] Okay. - They'll probably call you today. - [Hills] All right. - Bye-bye. - [Hills] Bye-bye. [subdued music] - Come on, let's go. One more time. Up. All right. Here, hold my two tones. Okay, let's go. There we go. - [Lori] Terry? - [Terry] Hmm? - [Lori] Why do we gotta walk all the way around here when the church is just up Wilmer Road? - [Terry] We can't go down Wilmer Road. - [Lori] Why not? - [Terry] Because we're colored. Colored folks aren't allowed down Wilmer Road. - [Lori] Who says? - [Terry] White folks. - [Lori] Even if we was going to church? That's a good reason. - [Terry] That is a good reason, but they don't think like that. Now, we're almost there. Don't drop my two tones now. All right now. We're almost there. - Mr. Kuhnke, we're 24 hours away from Lindsey's trial. What's the plan? - As I've said before, there is no evidence. It's a clear case of command influence and I'm requesting a change of venue. - And what does that do? - It'll give us an unbiased jury pool. Since there's no evidence, they can't convict. - With all due respect, Mr. Kuhnke. There are a lot of innocent people in prison whose lawyers said the same thing. [slow trumpet music] Thank you for coming out. - One cause, one purpose. No thanks needed. - [Man] All rise. [gavel bangs] - The defense will make its pretrial motions. - I'd like to submit a motion for a change of venue. On two grounds. On the grounds that Corporal Scott, in our opinion, cannot receive a fair and impartial trial because of command influence. Undue command influence. And because of pretrial publicity. - Request denied. [people mumbling] - You're Honor. - The defense request for a change of venue is denied. Counselor, I'll receive the plea of the accused now. - [Kuhnke] Your Honor, Corporal Scott pleads not guilty to all charges and specifications. - My god, we're going to trial. - We will call a witness who saw Corporal Scott that afternoon. Who will describe his clothing. Put him in a certain area at a certain time. We will call two witnesses who will place the corporal at a time which makes it impossible for him to have committed these offenses. - He hasn't even talked to any of them. - Agent Lindner, you still don't know where the crime scene is, do you? - No, sir. - And the FBI lab tests that you conducted for blood, semen, hair, soil on the soles of the shoes of the victim and the suspect. What were the results? - They were all negative or inconclusive. - So, there's absolutely no physical evidence linking Corporal Scott with the victim? - It was all negative or inconclusive. - Thank you, Agent Lindner. [tense music] - After he raped me, he started to choke me. I tried to push his arms away and then I blacked out. When I woke up, he was standing over me, and he had the knife in his hands, and he was laughing. - Do you see the man who did this to you in the courtroom today? - Yes, sir. - Would you please point him out to the members of the jury? - This man right there. - This government has no more questions for this witness, Your Honor. - Ms. Ames, I don't mean to upset you, but if I do, it's just to get at the truth. At the physical lineup you identified two men, didn't you? And you said you were sorry, but you couldn't be sure. - I was 99.9% sure. - But, didn't you say you were sorry you couldn't be sure? - Yes. [people chattering] - Thank you. - Is that what Kuhnke calls a cross-examination? I mean, for God's sake. He didn't even press her on the fact that she knew Scott. Her husband was friends with her. I mean, why didn't she just come out and say it was Lindsey Scott, the black guy who lives in my building? It's not like her husband had a lot of black co-workers. He only had one. Mr. Kuhnke. Mr. Kuhnke! [phone ringing] - Hello? It's Kuhnke. Honey, it's Kuhnke. - Hello? Mm-hmm. Why are you calling me now? I tried to have this conversation with you hours ago. [sighs] You know, if Lindsey Scott's life wasn't hanging in the balance I would just tell you to go to hell. Uh-huh. All right. Okay. [groans] [yawns] Now, he wants me to round up all the witnesses that he should've talked to a long time ago. God, what an idiot. Should've known. [people chattering] He'll be in a few minutes. Mr. Kuhnke, I got all the witnesses you wanted. Everybody's here but Ruby. - I see. Well, where is she? I need her now. - [Lori] Well, I don't know. I think she's on her way here, I hope. I know she hasn't had time to look at her records. - Time is of the essence. - By the way, you're welcome. Oh, Ruby. Please, answer the phone. Sister, be there. Ruby! I'm so glad you got my message. They want to put you on the stand next. - What? - Yes. - Girl, no. You must be out of your mind. No, my hair's a mess. I didn't even have any time to put any stockings on. And honey, nevermind the makeup. Oh, no. I cannot do this. - Don't fret. You're black, you're beautiful, and you're here to save the day. - Ms. Hills, did you see the accused, Corporal Lindsey Scott, on the 20th of April, 1983? - Well, sir. That's kind of hard for me to pinpoint whether I saw him on April 20th. - You don't know if you saw him on April 20th? - I remember the last time I saw him was in the Spring. [people chattering] - [Kuhnke] No more questions, Your Honor. - [Judge] The witness will step down. If the defense doesn't have any more witnesses to call at this time, the court will take a brief recess. [woman crying] [tense music] - We, the members of the jury, find the accused, Corporal Lindsey Scott, guilty on all counts and sentence him to be confined to hard labor for 30 years and his rank to be reduced to that of private. - Oh, no. No, he's not guilty. He's not guilty! Please, listen to me. Please, listen! Leave him alone! Leave him alone! He's not guilty! No, Lindsey! Lindsey! Lindsey! Don't touch me, don't touch me! Let him go! Let him go! He's not guilty! He's not guilty. [subdued music] - [Man] Well, this isn't the first time we've ran into this problem and he's said that to us. [phone ringing] - Well, why don't you tell him? - [Man] Well, I spoke to her husband last night. - Howard and Howard. Can I help you? One moment, please. [phone ringing] Howard and Howard. No, I'm sorry. Mr. Leino is on another phone call. Hold, please. Can I help you? - Yeah, I'm here to see Mr. Leino. - [Secretary] Do you have an appointment? - Lori Jackson. He's expecting me. - One moment, please. - Do you have a restroom I could use real quick? - [Secretary] Yeah, it's down the hall to the left. - Oh, thank you. [people chattering] - [Man] No, I'm sorry. I don't know her. Take a number and a message. Lori Jackson. - That's me. I'm with Women for Equal Social Justice. I think you should take a look at this brief. It's concerning the case United States versus Corporal Lindsey Scott. Now, he was wrongfully convicted of a crime he did not commit and I think that... - Excuse me. Whoa, whoa. I am familiar with the case. Please, have a seat. Take a deep breath. - Thank you. - So, how did you get my name? - Well, someone told me about your firm. They said it was the best criminal law firm in town. They also said it was impossible to get an appointment unless you called a month in advance, or were rich, or came with someone's recommendation. Well, I'm not rich, I don't have a month, so I improvised. I, however, am recommending myself. - New cases have to go through the partners. - You're not a partner? - No. - Oh. - Wait a second. That doesn't mean I can't help you. Talk to me. - Is an ineffectual defense a reason for a new trial? - Yes, it's called a Dubay hearing. Okay, you convince me this isn't a total waste of time so I can convince my bosses. - All right. - [Leino] Excuse me, Mr. Howard. - [Mr. Howard] Yes, John. What is it? - I just met with a woman, Lori Jackson, about the Lindsey Scott case. - Marine out of Quantico? Military appeals. Messy business, especially appealing the government. Look out. - She said the defense was not quite up to par. Now, I told her a Dubay hearing was a long shot at best. It's difficult to prove any defense team was ineffectual. - Look out. - Um. What do you think? - What do you think? - Well, she has a good case. - Military appeals. Read it. You have your first case. And tell them we'll do it pro bono. - By myself? Alone? - As counsel. Take Myers here if you need help. - Sir. - You can be co-counsels. It's about time you two started getting some courtroom exposure. - Yes, sir. - [Mr. Howard] Leino. - Yes, sir? - Take a few lessons from Myers on how to dress. - Yes, sir. What's wrong with the way I dress? - I don't know what you want from me, but I love the Marine Corps. I always have. I don't blame the corps for this, I blame the NIS. I was a good Marine and they had no right to treat me the way they did. I just want to be a good Marine again. - Mr. Leino? - I respect your conviction, Private. We'll see what we can do. [knocking on glass] - Well, that's time. - Right. You hang in there. - Yes, sir. - All right. - [Lori] I'll talk to you soon. - All right. - Myers was in the Army and I was a Marine. Myers was in a high-profile case where he defended a man accused of misdeeds in the My Lai massacre in Vietnam. Lori Jackson, this is Gary Myers. - Nice to meet you. - Likewise. I'm glad you made it back. Listen, there's some things we need to go over. - Like what? - Well, Mrs. Jackson. John and I need to hash out some legal issues here, so if you would excuse us. - So, the ignorant black woman just steps aside and let the Harvard boys do their thing? - This is as much your case as it is ours. - This is not just a case to me. This is a cause. There's a big difference. Now, let me be perfectly clear. I look out for Lindsey Scott, so I need to know what's going on. So, where do we start? Thank you. I have something important to say and I hope you'll understand. Lindsey's lawyers have made a motion for a retrial. - What does that have to do with all of us? - It means I'm going to be working with Leino and Myers and it could drag on for quite some time. - How long? - Maybe even a year or more. - A year? What I don't understand, Lori, is you've done it. You've done it. You got him high-powered lawyers, so Scott has a fighting chance, okay? - Paul. - Wait, how do you girls feel, huh? Am I the only one here? I guess I am. $200 worth of calls from Lindsey Scott. - Well, you know he has to call collect. - How are we gonna pay it? And now you're saying this case could drag on for another year? You've got to give it up. - You know, Paul. I don't know if you can ever understand. - I feel like you care more about Lindsey Scott than you're own family. - Are you calling me a bad mother? Why do you think I'm doing this? I don't want my girls called little niggers, or trying three times harder just to fit in. You don't have to make people comfortable. As if you're gonna steal their purse, or rob their house, just because your skin is dark. - Have you forgotten? My parents still haven't talked to me since I married you. - How can they just move a prisoner to another state without calling his lawyers, or his family? What kind of system is this? I mean, they're sneaking him out so that nobody can see him. - The transfer order's legit. There's nothing we can do about it. - Funny they should do it right when you file for a new trial and a Dubay hearing. - I know. You need to make time work for you in there. Use it. You need to get yourself in the right mindset just to get by. It's like you're getting ready for a tour of duty. The toughest tour in the corps. And you need to be tough to get by. - Lindsey. I swear on everything I love, I will get you out. You just have to trust me. [march-like music] - [Crowd] Free Lindsey Scott. Free Lindsey Scott. - [Reporter] Mrs. Jackson, you obviously believe Lindsey Scott is an innocent man. - Yes. Yes, I do. This man has been railroaded and convicted unjustly. - [Reporter] Don't you think Scott received a fair trial? - No, absolutely not. I was there, and I'm telling you, there's no way he received a fair trial. How could he when the Quantico command is pulling all the strings? The NIS has made Lindsey Scott guilty. [typewriter clacking] - Ooh. Hey, what's going on? - Dena, baby. [Dena crying] What happened? What's wrong? - Kids at school were giving her a hard time. - Well, why? - 'Cause her mom's on TV defending a rapist. - He is not a rapist. - [Teresa] He was found guilty, wasn't he? - I'm not defending a rapist. [subdued music] Let Mommy tell you something and I want you to listen very carefully. You're old enough now to realize that the world can be a very hard and unfair place. So, you've got to fight for yourself. Ain't nobody gonna do that for you. If we don't take care of things today, the future's just gonna be worse, baby. Dena? [dog barking] - I'm telling you, it's not too far and it's right on the lake, so I can fish while you get some peace and quiet. - Here, baby. - Mama, phone. - Whoa. No matter who, or what, that is, we're still going. Repeat after me. No matter who, or what, that is, we are still going. - [Lori] Hello? Yes, this is Lori Jackson. - Thanks. - 60 Minutes called. They want to interview me about the Lindsey Scott case. - Oh, my god! I've gotta tell Kelly! - How did that happen? - [Lori] Well, I just wrote a letter. - That's great, that's great. When are they coming? - Tomorrow. [subdued music] - I said I was going fishing. So, I'm going fishing. - [Man] All right, everybody. We're ready to start taping in 10 minutes. - [Crewman] Set it right here? - [Man] Yeah, that's good. Kick off that lamp. Let's do a sound check on her, all right? - [Crewman] All right. - [Man] That's good. Oh, that's too bright. - Oh, my god. Come on, honey. Hurry, hurry. You don't know when you're coming on. You could be right at the top. So, we don't want to miss it. - Can I get anybody something else to drink? - No, no, no. Go sit down. Watch your show. Now, this is your moment. - Come sit down. - I got my drink. I'm fine. - I hope I have enough makeup on. - Am I late? - No. It's just now starting. - [Man On TV] Corporal Lindsey Scott, Marine Corps prisoner. - There's my baby. I'm gonna marry him. [laughs] He could put his shoes under my bed any time. - Aunt Lily. - [Man On TV] Scott was court martialed, found guilty, and sentenced to 30 years at hard labor. It happened the night of April 20th, 1983. - [Lindsey On TV] In a situation like this, nobody wins. The victim doesn't win, I don't win being innocent. I just hope everything straightens itself out. - [Man On TV] The military revue board has ruled that Scott is entitled to a Dubay hearing. Not a new trial, but a hearing to decide whether he received a proper defense. - I guess they didn't need my interview. - [Man On TV] He may get a new trial. The Marine Corps has declined to comment. - Millions of people now are gonna know about the Lindsey Scott case. - That's right, honey. - Hmm. Oh, honey. I feel like such a proud fool. Inviting everybody over here seeing me on TV like I'm Betty Davis or something. - Honey, this is an incredible thing and you made it happen. So, congratulations. - Thanks, honey. Oh, well. That was my big debut. [slow trumpet music] - [Crowd] Free Lindsey Scott. Free Lindsey Scott. Free Lindsey Scott. - Wow, all this for a Dubay hearing. - It's the power of 60 Minutes. - After April 22, did you next have a meeting of substance with Mr. Kuhnke where presentation of evidence or exploration of defenses was discussed? - I didn't, sir. - Never again? - Never again, sir. - Could you elaborate on this, Private? - Well, sir. I asked Mr. Kuhnke by telephone several times to bring in the witnesses. Mr. Kuhnke repeatedly told me not to worry about it 'cause he didn't think the case would go to trial. - Private Scott, in your estimation, did you have 20 visits to Mr. Kuhnke's office? - No. - Did you have 10 visits to his office? - No. - Well, how many visits did you have alone with Mr. Kuhnke where you maintained your innocence and discussed your case? - One. - And that's your testimony under oath? - Yes, it is. - Mr. Kuhnke, in going to trial you stated you didn't prep any of the witnesses? - That's right. I had talked. I had... - Wait, wait. What was Private Scott charged with? - Attempted murder, rape, sodomy, forceful abduction. - And you didn't prep any of the witnesses? - I didn't prep them, no. - Did you prep Private Scott? - I didn't have to. - Why not? - He professed his innocence and I told him to tell the truth. - Okay. All right. Let me think, let me think. Okay, on April 20th I arrested both these guys for shoplifting. And I made a note about a third guy who I thought was a part of the team. Oh, see. Here it is. This note, this guy. This is Lindsey Scott. I am sure of it. - You'll testify to that? - Are you kidding will I testify? You bet I will testify. - And it is now your testimony, under oath, that on the night of April 20th, 1983, between the hours of eight and 8:30 p.m., one Lindsey Scott was present at a Zayre's Department Store? - That's correct. - Thank you, Ms. Hills. You may step down. [people chattering] Your Honor, the defense rests its case and moves for a dismissal of all charges against Lindsey Scott. - We'll take a recess while I make my decision. [gavel bangs] [tense music] The defense motion for a dismissal of the charges against Private Scott is denied. I have no authority beyond that which is given me in the order. However, given the facts of this case, I am recommending that this be referred to General Tumi for review. - Your Honor, we feel that freeing Private Scott to his family with appropriate restrictions is in the interest of justice. - I'm sorry, Counselor. I have no authority to grant such a request. It'll have to be up to General Tumi. [gavel bangs] - The man sat on this case for months, now he says he doesn't have the power to make a decision. Back to square one. [slow trumpet music] [phone ringing] Hello? - [Man On Phone] Rapist loving nigger bitch. You're gonna die! - Wrong number. - [Paul] Who was it? - Can I lie? - No. - Not even a little? It started unpleasant and it ended even worse. - Well, you got your publicity. Now, you got your threats. - These threats must mean that we've touched a nerve and as far as I'm concerned that means we're on the right track. - [Paul] What if someone decides to do something more? - Look, I can't be concerned about all that now. We've got bigger things to worry about. - Than what? What's bigger than the safety and welfare of our family? [phone ringing] - [Lori] I'll get it. - I'll get it. Racism hotline. Oh, gosh. I'm sorry. Just a sec. It's Tanya. - Tanya? Hey. Yeah, girl. We've been receiving some fan appreciation. - Having reviewed the material from the Dubay hearing of the United States versus Lindsey Scott, this court has, in a two-to-one majority decision, decided to uphold the prior conviction. [subdued music] - [Lori] Can I come to the dance with you? - [Terry] This is for grownups. - [Lori] I won't get in the way. - If you behave, I'll bring you back some licorice, all right? - My sweater. I forgot my sweater at the church. - [sighs] We'll get it next week. Ain't nobody gonna take you sweater from the church. - My daddy gave me that sweater. That's the sweater my daddy gave me. - Nobody's gonna take the sweater your daddy gave you. - What if it gets dirty? It ain't gonna smell like my daddy no more. - All right. I want you to go home. Start helping your mama make dinner. By the time you lay down tonight, I'll have the sweater for you, all right? Get on now. [people shouting] [tires squealing] - You want your kids growing up with this kind of garbage in their faces? - No, but I damn sure ain't gonna let them intimidate me. Let's go to bed. Come on, girls. Let's go. [wood thumps] - Teresa? Teresa, why don't you come help? Hey. You can read that later. Right now your mom and I would like your help, okay? [tense music] Lori. - Mama? - Mama? - Mama. - [Paul] Get a pillow. Call 911. - [Woman On PA] Hospital X-Ray tech to ICU. Hospital X-Ray tech to ICU. [knocking on door] - Let's talk. Your test results are in. - Oh. - You have cancer in your liver. - Well, how do we fix that? - Well, there are a number of treatments. They're all invasive. They're all gonna make you very sick and they're not gonna change the outcome. - What does that mean? - I'm sorry to say this, but your cancer is terminal. Now, I want you to stay in the hospital for a week or two. I want to try and boost your immune system. The important thing now is to get rest and to conserve your energy. - Doc, could you just give us a little time alone? - Yeah. - Yeah, just a minute alone. That's all. - [Doctor] I'll just be... - Thanks. Honey. - Don't look at me like that. I have a trial to prepare for. [subdued music] Now, you've gotta let me tell the kids in my own time. Promise? Where are we going? What is this? - A little happy place to hold onto with all your might. - What is it? Whose is it? - Well, it's ours. Well, it's not actually ours yet, but. - Paul, say you're joking. Tell me you're joking. - Come on. - Paul. - [Paul] What? Come on. Come on, girlfriend. We're burning daylight. - You didn't. I can't believe it. It's beautiful. - [Paul] Mm-hmm. - [Both] Welcome home, Mama. [laughs] - [Dena] Don't you love it? - I love it. - Come on, have a seat. - Congratulations, Mama. Isn't it the best? - It's the best. - See? It's big enough for the girls to have their own bedrooms. Office for you, office for me. And it's so private. Bad guys are gonna have a hard time finding us. - It's beautiful. You're beautiful. I love you. I love you so very much. Thank you. - Here we go. Military's equivalent of the Supreme Court. We lose here, we're done. Myers is presenting the opening statement. - Every man has a right to a fair trial and a fair trial includes adequate legal counsel. If the court case were a horse race, this would be like putting one jockey on a track without a horse. That is not fair, that is not legal. That is not how our justice system works. Lindsey Scott's original defense lawyer, Ervin Kuhnke, did not prepare an alibi defense for the inexplicable reason that he didn't think the case would go to trial. The linkage between Mr. Kuhnke's conduct and the conclusion of the case was palpable and clear. We end up with no preparation whatsoever and we end up with a conviction. The practice of criminal law involves getting your shoes dirty. All Mr. Kuhnke did was sit at his desk. [knocking on door] - Mr. Myers. - Hey, Lori. After all this time, it's Gary. - Listen, I spoke to my source at the Washington Post. She heard about a Major Ron McNeil who's at the Marine JAG Office at Camp Lejueune. Have you heard of him? - Toughest prosecutor the marine Corps has. What about him? - Well, she heard that he's been ordered to report to Quantico to start prepping a big case. - You know what this means? - Looks like we're winning the appeal and they're scared. Good work. - Thank you. - I can't believe it. Finally. Oh, John. Good job. Thank you. Yeah. I'll talk to you soon. It's official. Lindsey Scott is coming home. At least for now. - I'm sick and tired of Lindsey Scott. - Oh, honey. Don't be such a sourpuss. Ow. - Mama, you don't look so good. - What? - You heard me. - Oh, don't be such a sourpuss, honey. We have so much to celebrate about. [door creaks] - Why are you in here so much lately? - Just trying to get settled in. Taking on some extra clients. - That's not what I'm asking about. Mama's sick. - Yeah, well she's been under a lot of stress lately. - Really sick. Don't you care? - Clean sheets. Dena did the laundry. Can you believe it? - Sweetheart. - Yeah? - Teresa knows. - Did you tell her? - Two-stepped around it. But, I think it's time. She's got to be told. - I'm just waiting for the right time. - Honey, there is no right time. - Soon. Soon, I promise. [subdued music] - Excuse me, Dr. Sturla? - [Dr. Sturla] Mm-hmm? - I'm Lori Jackson's daughter. I need to talk to you about my mother. [typewriter clacking] - [Lori] Coffee? - Mm-hmm. - Aunt Lily, I want you to go through that document and anywhere you see Ruby Hills' name, I want you to highlight it for me. - [Aunt Lily] All right. - Coffee? - Yeah, thanks. - I hope it's not too strong. This stuff will make you stand up for sure. [Myers laughs] [coughing] [door slams] Hey, I was wondering where you were. - I went to the hospital. - What happened, baby? - I had a talk with your doctor. He said I needed to have a conversation with you. - I think we should have this conversation... Sweetheart, we have company. We should just go in... - I don't wan to go. Exactly how sick are you? - I'm very sick. - How sick? - I have cancer. - What are they doing about it? - There's nothing they can do about it. - Why didn't you tell me? Does Paul know. Do you know? Why didn't you tell me? I'm your daughter! I'm your family! - I'm sorry, baby. - I hate you! - No, wait, wait. - I hate you! - Wait, wait. Baby, please. Baby, please. You're right, I should've. You know, I should've told you. I should've told you. I just couldn't do it. Oh, Teresa. Shh. [Teresa crying] Easy, baby. Easy. Oh, Teresa, honey. - Oh, Mama. - You're my daughter. You know, you're Mommy's sweetheart. You're my baby. I know how terrible this is for you. - All I ever wanted was for you to be around. And now I find out you're never gonna be. [crying] [subdued music] - How are you doing? - Okay. Good, actually. - Hmm. - It's just this weather. It makes me feel so old and gray. Well. - You look beautiful. - [Crowd] Free Lindsey Scott. Free Lindsey Scott. Free Lindsey Scott. Free Lindsey Scott. - Here we go again. If we win this time you're gonna be a free man. How you doing? - Are you okay? - I'm fine. - You sure? - You remember what the Marine stands for? - Protecting the Constitution, protecting people who can't protect themselves, and being the best man you can be. - When we go in there today. - Mm-hmm? - You remember that 'cause all eyes are on you. - Yes, ma'am. - [Crowd] Free Lindsey Scott. Free Lindsey Scott. Free Lindsey Scott. - [John] Agent Lindner, during the NIS investigation of this case, what were the forensic tests that were done? - Standard rape examination. At the hospital, certain items were obtained form the victim. Blood, saliva, fingernail scrapings, head hair samples, pubic hair samples, vaginal swabs. We also obtained samples from Corporal Scott. We sent it all to the FBI laboratory in Washington D.C. to look for basically any cross-transfer of body fluids, fibers, hair. Anything that might link the suspect to the victim. - [John] And what were the results of your findings? - All the tests came back negative or inconclusive. [people chattering] - Now, concerning the physical lineup. After looking at the men in the lineup, didn't she pick out two men then turn to you and say, "I'm sorry, I can't be sure, but number five scares me the most"? - Her closing statement. Yes, sir. - Now, Is that your standard for a positive identification in a rape case? - No, sir. - [John] Well, thank you for your honesty. I have nothing further for this witness, Your Honor. - You can step down now. [people chattering] [subdued music] [groaning] [woman crying] [gasping] - [yells] What's wrong? Honey? - I was dreaming about Terry. - Jeez. Shh. Okay, it's okay. Shh. It's okay. - [Soldier] Thank you. All right. - Thank you, sir. - [Soldier] Next, please. - I just had to make sure everything goes all right with Ruby today. - I want you to go back in your car, get back to your nice warm house, and I'm gonna call you later and give you the good results. - You know I can't do that. Come on. - Now, Jill. I'm gonna ask you a very important question. I want you to look around this courtroom and I want you to point to the individual who raped you, who forced you to commit sodomy, who stabbed you, slashed you in the neck, and left you in the woods to die. Would you point to him? Let the record reflect that the witness has identified the accused, Corporal Scott. - Ms. Ames, when you viewed the physical lineup, you became aware of the fact that Agent Lindner wanted to be sure about your identification of the individual. - That's correct. - Isn't that why you said, I'm sorry, I can't be sure, because in your own mind you weren't completely sure of your identification? - I wasn't 100%, that's correct. - [Ron] How is it that you could remember seeing Scott's face for sure on a specific night years later? - I found the arrest records for that day. It had photos of the two busts I had made that day and I remembered him in conjunction with those two men. - [Ron] How did you remember him? - Well, he was very unusual looking. - Isn't it true that you were prompted to provide an alibi and that you aren't really sure when, or if, you saw Lindsey Scott? - No, sir. I know I saw him that night. I just needed the pictures to place him on that specific day. Those were the two pictures of the two men I had arrested that day. I remembered Lindsey Scott because I thought he was a part of a shoplifting team. - We have no further questions, Your Honor. - You may step down, Ms. Hills. [people chattering] - Your Honor, the defense rests its case. - That went well. - [Teresa] Mama. - [Lori] Yeah, baby? - Mama? - Uh-huh. What are you doing? - I don't know. What are you doing? Where'd you get all this junk? - Junk? - Yes, this stuff is older than I am. Look at this dress here. - I wore this when I brought you home from the hospital. You were all little and helpless and quiet, for once. - What are you gonna do with it? - I don't know. Saint Vincent will take it. I've been telling Paul I'd get rid of some of this... - No. You can't throw it away. - [Lori] Well, why not? - Maybe I want it. You know, my later years. Might enter a pregnancy pageant. [Lori laughing] - I don't think. You want to see something funny? - Sure. - Okay. Oh. Hold out your hand. Now, let me see. These are your teeth. Two from you and two from Dena. And my Tooth Fairy paid good money. - [laughs] I remember. - This was Dena's. It took me seven years to get this away from that girl. I want you to save this for her. You know, your baby sister's not like you. She needs a lot of validation. I don't want a day to go by that you don't compliment her, you hear? [subdued music] Okay. We've gotta clean all this stuff up. I have to go soon. One last thing. You know what this means to me. What it represents to me. You know that we will both be looking over you. Always. Always, baby. [crying] - [Teresa] I love you. - I love you, too. Mommy loves you, too. Oh, I love you. You take care of your sister. - The surgery should remove the blockage. Now, I know it's hard, but try and relax. I'll see you in the recovery room afterwards. - Okay. Thanks, Doc. You know, this is going to be over before you know it, darling. Piece of cake. Don't worry. - Jury's deliberating, so have CNN on when I come out. - [Paul] Okay, honey. I love you. - [Lori] I love you. [machine beeping steadily] - [Dr. Sturla] All right, here we go. [solemn music] - Hey, minnow. Look what I got. Your sweater. Here we go. [machine beeping rapidly] - [Nurse] Doctor, her vital signs are unstable. [steady tone echoing] - [Terry] Yeah, I got your sweater. Come on, let's go. [machine beeping steadily] - [Reporter On TV] In Quantico, Virginia, the second court martial of Corporal Lindsey Scott is almost over. The defense has rested its case and a verdict is expected sometime today. CIA operatives used unmarked helicopters to deliver explosives and other supplies to Contra rebel units inside Nicaragua last year despite a congressional ban on U.S. [people chattering] [subdued music] - We have reached a verdict. Corporal Lindsey Scott, United States Marine Corps, this court martial now finds you of all charges and specifications not guilty. - Thank you. [crowd cheering] [triumphant music] - Honey? Hey. - Hey. - How you doing? - Tell me 10 things you love about me. - Right now? I love your smile. [subdued music] I love the way you brush your hair. I love the way you smell. I love the way you hum those silly tunes when you're in the shower. I love your hands. How soft they are. I love the way you never give up on me, and the children, or anything else that you believe in. How many is that? - I think two. [both laugh] - Hey, um, the verdict's in. - I know. I know. [solemn music] [subdued music]
