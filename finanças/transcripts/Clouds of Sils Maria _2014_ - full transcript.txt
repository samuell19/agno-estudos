Good evening, counselor. I told your client, my future ex-husband, I can't make the arbitration hearing for the simple reason that I'll be abroad. Furthermore, I know he wants my half of the apartment. I made a fair offer. Check the price of real estate in the 7th arrondissement. I'm accommodating, but not dumb. I know I'm on the losing end. You know the law better than me, don't you? I am entitled to force a sale. If he wants to sell and split the money, fine with me. We'll put it up for sale and you'll see the market price. This is Maria Enders. I know. Thank you. A sequel to Maloja Snake? Yes, he did mention it to me. He wanted me to play Sigrid 20 years later. But I have no idea what he had in mind. It was very vague. He must have given up on it. Do I regret it? Of course I regret it. Join us at the hotel. See you there. Spare me the gloom. I'm not the one who died. I know Wilhelm died. I happen to be in Zurich. Unfortunately, he must leave tomorrow morning. Henryk Wald! I stood on this stage four years ago in the play The Reichstag is Burning by Wilhelm Melchior. Little did I know it would be Wilhelm's last play. He was sitting there in the third row, staring at me. My acting was never so lousy. Wilhelm Melchior will be with us always... in his plays. I will have the privilege of performing them here, in London, everywhere. So I say not “Farewell,” but... “See you, Wilhelm.” Thank you, Henryk, for that wonderful tribute. Now please welcome an old friend of Wilhelm's. A warm round of applause for... Maria Enders! Cloud Phenomena of Maloja. Its harbingers. The clouds wind up the Maloja Pass. The so-called Maloja snake.
