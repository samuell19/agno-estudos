Tell me what you see. I can see the sea. It's deep blue. And I think those are olive trees. Or... maybe pines. And now there's just some stupid grey concrete wall. Carry on. He's driving damn fast. That's how people drive here. They've got a lift built into the cliff. Yes, put him through. Mr Junghans. Yes. You can bother me any time. You're on holiday! Yes... I'm abroad for a week. Yes. Yes... I'll take care of it as soon as I'm back. I see. You're on holiday! I'll have a look at it this evening, you'll have the figures tomorrow. Good. Goodbye then, Mr Junghans. Yes? Yes. Bye. Are you nuts? How do you like it? Are you serious? I reserved us two sun loungers. Could you stop that? Stop what? I've got a face, too, haven't I? A beautiful one. I'm going swimming. Can you feel anything yet? He talks to me. What do you mean, "he"? My father said he's going to be a boy. So he can take over the company. Shall we go out again? Out! Out! Net. So... Don't fidget about. Stand still. Yes? Do I have your attention? Judith, stop, stop! Christ! You know I don't like your silliness! Just say if you don't want to play tennis. Hello? Yes, you can put him through. Hello. Yes, Mr Junghans. You got me. I haven't got round to it. Yes. He told you, did he? Yes, thanks. Of course. Yes, that won't change. You too, have a nice day Mr Junghans. Bye. What? Fine, I'll check it again. Yes. I'll call you back, OK? Yes, OK. Judith's just coming. Will do. All right. Bye. Could you please not put it on the bed? - I wanted to show it to you. - But it stinks. Could you take it out again? Who were you just speaking to? Your father wanted to know something about a payment. - So he calls you? - Yes. Why do you ask? Because he should discuss it with me. You can just take it easy. That's for me to decide. Judith! What are you doing there? Is everything all right? Sometimes I have the feeling you just need someone to tag along. Someone you can say "we" about when you only mean you. Hello? Did you get my mail? Hello? And how is Judith? Fine. I'd like to talk to her. She's in the bathroom. Judith... - Hey. - Hey. - Do you like the hotel? - Yes. Great. We have good news. Who is we? Gregor is now handling Mr Junghans to take some pressure off you. Come on, let's do something. Let's write down how we imagine our lives in ten years. A letter to ourselves. - What's the point of that? - It's a thought experiment. Because everything's so lovely now. OK. And in ten years we'll open the letter and see where we are. In ten years, my wife will be managing... the company, and I'll be looking after our ten children. How about drinking a little less? We're on holiday. I'm not drinking. You're pregnant. - And you could not drink for a change. - But I'm not pregnant! Are you nuts? Did you write the letter? What letter? I want to have a family. I want to share it with you. I want us to give each other some sense of stability. For us to make plans together... that we can rely on. It's... It's so absurd... that a woman who didn't want to marry or have children now has dummies placed at her altar. Why don't you answer your phone? Come on! Give me my bag back. What do you want from me? For real, Judith? Because of the letter? Do you want to recite the Poem of the Madonna? - Come on, let's hear it. - Do it in dialect. Come on, don't be shy. Do it for Mum at least! - Yes, today is Mum's birthday. - Yes, we need it! "Oh great queen, - "Tonight all bow down to you." - Louder! "You great, immaculate saint! "You will always be the most beloved. "Every year we will bow down at your feet "While all the people are enjoying your feast..." I wrote the letter. The wine tastes watery.
