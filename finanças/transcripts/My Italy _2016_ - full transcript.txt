Are these the only catalogues? How many do you want? There are 4 artists Great! Do you think people appreciate this contemporary art thing? There was that pretty good subject... the one about the dance school with the two young guys... That wasn't bad! What time is our flight? At a quarter to... Come on. No, put everything back and let's go... The dance school. This, too. I was 21... 22 years old when I did my first poster for the theatre. Theatre of Sources, directed da Jerzy Grotowski. Are you Bednarski? - Yes, I am. - The sculptor? Yes, that's me. Can I have a word with you? It's about a job. I'm Mark Kostabi, an American artist, and I'm following in the footsteps of Joseph Beuys who said we have to spread art. I also love De Chirico and I'm selling my paintings door-to-door. What? I don't understand. - Have you got the pen drive? - Yes. Hey, cheer up. Really. I mean it! I was taking some rest. Well, you're resting with a face that looks like... If the project goes through all our problems are over. Let's hope so. I don't mean everything, but at least you'll give me a few unpaid salaries, no? How much do I owe you? A month, two... - Six months' salary! - Six months? Six months. Then there are all the things I noted down. The expenses I paid for... Ok, you always keep accounts, write everything down. I'm doing it. We're going to the biggest Polish producer If you go in with that look on your face... It's important! He'll see that you're awkward. - Are you feeling awkward? - No. Your "no" sounds like a "yes". It's mingling contemporary art with comedy with professional artists that allows you to... How can I put it... Sorry, may I? Come in. - One moment, please. - No, no... Sign here, please. And here. And here. I can't before 4 pm. Sure, I'll tell him right away. Sorry, please, do go on. I was saying, now, the felicitous short circuit, between comedy and a more specialized subject... We've got nearly all the budget, only 30 % still needs to be covered, which could be your side of your contribution. You've got it all here. - The estimated costs... - Yes. We have to think about it. And submit everything to our board to get it okayed, obviously. I see not only Bednarski in your project, also Polish names, important people, actors, our artists. And the Italian ones, too, are high-level. But amongst the Italian cast I would have liked to see a great Italian actress. I mean your unrivalled Serena Dream. Let me show you something. Wait just a second... Serena! And here I also have all her masterpieces. "Joy's Photos", what a film! He's got them all... I'd very much like you to join your project. And in this I think I'm expressing the wishes of our entire board. I would add that we have a privileged relationship... Serena Dream! - Yes... - Dream. "The Violoncello Teacher". God knows how many times I saw that one. - Do you know who this Serena Dream is? - No. I have no idea who Serena Dream is. "Big Joan the Mistress"... She made risqué films. How do you pronounce the Polish actor's name? - Kojak. - Oyak. - Oyak. - Yes. Oyak. I wanted to ask you, Do you think that on our side the Grotowski Foundation, The Grotowski Centre, would they, I don't know, give financial support for our project? No, I mean, on your part, would you at all consider supporting our project? - Do you speak Italian 7 - Yes. No, I mean, Hojak, do you think you might support our film project... interesting... You think it's possible? I mean step in... Ok, Oyak, it was a pleasure. Something's moving here... Since we got out of this big black hole there's been a big change. When I first came to Rome in the 1980s, it was all different. And I live like this, between Warsaw and Rome. One foot here, one there. I found you at last. You live in Warsaw, don't you? Yes, between Rome and Warsaw. My husband died four days ago. I'm so sorry. - He was a wonderful person. - I'm sure. They said he was a Camorra mobster. My husband! He even got elected mayor. They all loved him, and he never deserved to die like that, in a stinking jail, like a pauper! - I don't understand, in jail? - In jail! What does that have to do with me, Madam! Let me explain. You see, there's our son. He loves cinema. Films are his passion! Knows them all by heart. He wanted to study in Rome, then he went to Warsaw University. Oh, really? He also served time, for murder. But he was innocent. He had a scrape with a guy, and a good judge gave him right of self-defence. So, when my husband and I went to visit him, he didn't take us for a city tour like everyone else. No! He took us to see all the graveyards. - There's a whole bunch of them in Warsaw! - Yes. Full of graveyards. In one of these graveyards we saw that lovely thing you did... I don't remember... I've got a picture of it here. Here it is. Yes... it's my sculpture on the tomb of Krzysztof Kieslowski. A great film director, a very great man! - Sloski - Kieslowski, yes. My husband, when he saw your work, the funeral monument you did, he was moved. He liked it so much that he started crying. Then he dried his tears, and said to our boy: "Hey Raf, when I die I want one that's exactly like that!" That's why I'm here. I don't quite understand. What can I do for you? You have to make exactly the same. Exactly the same? Identical. Lady, are you kidding? It's impossible! You can't make the same thing again. I'm sorry for your husband, but I don't make tombs, I'm a sculptor... Money is no object. - I take the liberty, Maestro. - Money is no object. I brought you a small advance. - Just a small sum for you. - It's not a question of money. But you just can't do a sculpture twice. I can’t! - Nothing doing, Lady. - Ok, Maestro. - I'm sorry. - Ok! My brother-in-law told me go ahead, said he can't come just now. He said: "Go ahead, and I'll join you if any problem crops up". He's in Rome, too. He lives right in front here, under house arrest. Art is a promise of happiness, said Baudelaire. And Italy has always had a natural landscape and an aesthetic one. The Grand Tour is historically the systematic trip which intellectuals and artists from all over the world took at least once in their lives, like going to Lourdes. Well, the Lourdes of beauty is Italy, let's say. Apart from the Vatican. Contemporary art isn't only a slap in the public face, as Boccioni used to say, scandal, performance, a larger-than-life event. Contemporary art is a break and continuity, a way to plan the past. Those who presume to lead these days, ain't leaders at all. They have no idea what it means to put twenty dwarfs together... A midget, and then a freak. They have no idea! A cripple, a hunchback, a wretch... Listen, Solari, you've got to solve a big problem, a really big one. You've got to find Serena Dream. She flipped out long ago. Never showed up again! I heard she became a nun, then went into theatre, King Lear, Hamlet, something like that... Like she's in the looney bin? Or can I contact hen... Have you got her number, yes or no? Trying to play around with me? You don't know me! I have all the numbers, highly professional! This is my job! What did he say? That he'll track her down. He can find even a dead man. Solarino is great, a sensitive intelligent man. Do one thing, stop where you can, let's just call her up. Hi, Serena! I am an Italian film director and producer, and I'm calling you from Warsaw. We're doing an independent film, and I thought of giving you a part... You're Gigi, Faustino's pal, the jockey. - Gigi? - Go and tell Faustino I want a good horse, not like the last time. No, I assure you, Serena... We've got a big problem here! I got your number from Solarino, the agent. - She's saying Gigi who is the guy? - Gigi? Solarino? Since we're getting ready to start, I thought if you don't mind we'll send you a air ticket so you can come here and we can talk it over. Yes, sure. God! Sorry for not catching... Yes. Sorry about the horse! Anyhow, thanks. Thanks. Bankrupt. How's that possible! Did you look carefully? How strange... Let's see if I have some more. What's this? This is the Telepass, - This is my Ikea. - We have a hundred and twenty euros. - I mean yours? - Hundred and twenty euros! Hundred and twenty? She wants to give me money. A bag full of money. A hundred, five hundred... I don't know what to do! In human history, the artist was always the one who hesitated, but always ended up accepting patronage. Why? Because while he creates, he forgets who the patron is. And he already feels like the future memory of history. If you go to an archeological museum in Rome, there's a bust of Nero, the first who did the Roman Summer Fest, burnt the city down. In the 20th century we have portraits of lots of gangsters, in politics, right-wing, left-wing: portraits of Stalin, Mussolini, Salazar, Franco... Art is a stain remover: crimes of all sorts get pardoned in the name of Beauty. I've seen the tombs you did in Warsaw and I really think that, paradoxically, you are an avantguarde sculptor of funeral monuments. - Thanks. - Your best work is in the cemeteries. What do you say, should I do this tomb? That widow, how did she ask for the tomb? She wants it exactly the same, like Kieslowski's. Yes, but how is it there? The film director's gesture. So do it like this for her. Like this! - Hi, guys! - Hi ! - How's it going? - Pretty good. - And you? - Good! Do you know if a woman showed up black, thin, a bit of a Neapolitan accent? No, I didn't see her. - No? Nobody asked you. - Not till now. Why are they trying to contact you? Nothing... Money used to go from Rome to Warsaw, these days, Italians, too, unfortunately they follow me. They go abroad. Correct. Not only Warsaw, Breslaw too, Wroclaw, almost 3,000 young people got a job, as per their profession. Take this. Thanks. - Hey, you Italian? - Yep! I'm Italian. Me, too! I'm from Arezzo. I used to have a business in Italy, cleaning. Then came the slump, taxes... I lost everything. All that's left is this bucket and the squeegee. That's all you got left? And how are things, ok? Earning little by little. My uncle's over there, sells jackets, things are slowly picking up... - He's from Arezzo. - From Arezzo? And you? Forget about that. All the best! Thanks, to you too. Are you Mr. Bednarski, the artist? Yes, I am. Congratulations. What for? Can I sit down for a moment? Sure... I saw the Fellini sculpture you did in Rimini. I liked it a lot. Can we speak Italian it's nice, please! I came to Naples as a kid. But was lucky enough to meet a very important person: Raffaele Scognamiglio. He's the one who got me into the environment, taught me everything. A collector? I was serving time at Poggioreale, having cracked a bottle over a Polish friend's head. Just for fun. But I got arrested. I risked getting deported back to Poland. Didn't know what to do. But that was just my good luck. A good and generous man, who unfortunately died a few weeks ago. She said: "Keep your eye on him". "Make sure "he doesn't come in harm's way". If you need anything, call me. STOLEN BY UNKNOWN HANDS ON THE KIESLOWSKI'S GRAVE Everything go ok? How was the journey? Great! Excuse me quickly... My feet were so sore I didn't know what to do. Now I'll put them in my bag... Vever mind me! Never mind! I'm the assistant of the producer and director. Yes, that makes me happy. I saw "Big Joan the Mistress". Pretty good, tongue in cheek, great fun. Sorry if I ask you this question, what did the film-maker think of me? Because he is very much... He's seen all your pictures, and then we talk about you a lot. But now he'll tell you all about it! I don't want to... But now I only do theatre classics. I'm sorry to hear that. But what's this picture about? Well... Let him tell you, I don't want to... But I'm the lead actress, right? Well, yes... That's what I was expecting! He booked the upper suite. BYE bye, goodnight. - Goodnight. - Bye. 100 zloty, that's all I've got left. Hello, Mom! In Warsaw. In Poland, Mom. Yes, I'm making a film. Well, a really good film-maker! Yeah, and he's the producer too. I don't know him. No, I don't even know his name. Apparently he's really good. Hello! Yes, good day to you. This is fantastic news! When did she arrive? Good. Hotel Marriott, yes. Now I'll make sure personally that Ms Dream has suitable accommodation... Yes, no, the lady is my personal guest. Someone said that something is rotten in Denmark. Kirchhoff comes from Denmark. They didn't stop him at the border, he settled down in Rome, and even came to Padula, the Charterhouse, and created "The works and the Days" for an exhibition of mine, a sort of public urinor with tiles that have immortal, as it were, phrases on them. What I mean to say is that is an existential artist. Hello? Are you the artist Thorsten Kirchhoff? Yes, I am. Good morning, I'm the plumber here at Certosa, Sala Consilina, Padula... the whole area. The plumber? You made that latrine. The one in the Charterhouse, at Padula with the crossword puzzles on tiles. Yes, it's a work of art. Let's say a sculpture, yes. We're going to have to move it, there's water leaking in. It's not water, it's a recording! There's a loudspeaker... What do you mean, a recording, it's water alright, there's 10 centimeters of water! What do you mean, 10 centimeters of water! You have to come and move it, because there's water leaking in and I can't do my repair work, can't go on with my work. In Padula? Sure, I can come. I have a car, but it's not a car like... It'll take me, let's say, three or four hours, days... Ok, let's do something: I'll move the thing, don't worry about it. Know what, Torten? I'll use two good tiles much better ones. Fourteen years of garbage! To hell with you... I was disappointed Very much But next day When I saw your empty bed Domenico? What? Kirchhoff! What happened? I have an ache from here to here. I'm leaving for somewhere, please check my Cinquecento. Check? Why check! Runs like clockwork! I have to go to Padula. Do you really have to go? Why, Padula no... I won't get there? Sure you'll get there! Well, with that can. How many kilometres is it? Just to know. Six hundred! - Why don't you go to Naples? - Naples? Beautiful ! Naples is beautiful. But if my problem is in Padula, what's Naples got to do with it? What a fixation, Padula! Padula... why so obsessed! I have a problem in Padula. A bathroom is leaking. This is ok... See? Everything's just Perfect! Just perfect, no need to check. Yes, Hi, this is Kirchhoff speaking. See here, the car has broken down. So do this, I'll solve your problem. Take all your things out of the car, all your things, lock the car, and take a nice little train and come here, ok? It can even be fun. Sit by the window, and enjoy the landscape. Tell me, are you by chance going south? You're lucky, hop in. We're like weeds, our people have gone through all the contradictions... Here in the Spanish quarters half of the inhabitants are multiracial. Here you get all the smells, all the spices, all the races, cheek-by-jowl. Like having the whole world at your doorstep. Here they always talk of crime, these things... Do you know why I live here? Because it's still human here. - Sorry... - Madonna! What's going on? They've shot Vincenzo You have to shut up... Damn it. Shut up. They're all mad! I have to leave this place. Is it a shootout? No, nothing, people are watching cowboy films on TV... Well, having said this... But who is? Nothing, it's the lady on the third floor, in front here: she jumped out of the window. - What do you mean ? Is she dead? - No. She jumps down on the mattresses. Here they throw mattresses out of the window, you know, bags... So she knows exactly at what time they do it... And jumps out of the window. She always checks, I guess, that the mattresses are there. She jumps, then gets back on her feet and goes shopping. See? That's how things are here. But in this city, that's kind of strange. You can help me, but I've got this thing here, a deflector. Show me. Do you know somebody, somehow... I can't get these anymore. A spare part for a vintage car. Rosellina and Malu. At Grotta della Stella. Excuse me, do you know Grotta della Stella? Grotta della Stella? I'll tell you right away. Gimme the watch. - What's going on? - The bracelet. - Hand over the money. - Take it easy. - Move your ass. - Yes. Out with the cash, quick! Come on. - We've been mugged! - Yes, this is a robbery, sir. But now these guys are looking for another chance, - They're coming back. - They're coming back. We're going to get mugged again. We have nothing left. Grotta della Stella, at the top of the hill, second turning to the right. Second turning? Thanks. - He said the second... - Second turning to the right. Hello. Hello. Malu, see what this guy wants. Can I help you? I'm looking for a deflector. A deflector? - A deflector? - This. This kind. Let me have a look. I've got one already, but I want the original. - It belongs to a Cinquecento. - Yes, bravo! We have one. - Let me... - What's wrong? - What are you doing? - Let go... Madonna, this bitch... Maybe it's better... - Come over here! - Shall I come later? - Stop. - Let go. Excuse me. See her? A great singer! They don't appreciate her because in the festivals in public squares they want women. I used to be an impresario, for singers. One day she came and said: "I want to do an audition". When I heard her sing I went out of my mind. I've had a lot of women. They called me "Angel Face". They called him "Angel Face". I gave everything up for this bitch. Gave everything up for me. He promised me the earth, and look where I landed. In a cave, selling garbage. Let me find the deflector, now... The deflector! Got it. Thorsten Kirchhoff has come to wash his ghosts in the warm waters of the Mediterranean. Kirchhoff, basically, travels through museums, through his own obsessions, even at night. He goes through them, moving over a terrain that is quite linked to cinema, I would say, Nordic with the idea of loneliness, melancholy. And through various media and different languages: painting, sculpture, drawing, even video Kirchhoff tries to represent all this, to put it on stage. Can I come in? Anyone there? Hi! Hello. Sorry if I came in like this. My scooter broke down, right here. There's no petrol and nobody, no cars in sight. - I need... - Would you like some wine? Some cheese? Thanks, but I don't want to be a nuisance. Don't worry, nobody ever eats anything here. - Are you from Piemonte? - No, I'm Danish. But I'm coming Rome. I'll go and get you some wine and cheese. Thanks. Michelina de Cesare, love made her into a bandit woman. Women who get killed for the sake of love. How many things do they do for love's sake, these women! Highway robbery: men and women all herded into a concentration camp. In northern Calabria, at Guardia Piemontese, from all over southern Italy. A report mentions Angelina, shot at 11 years of age for being a bandit. Poor Michelina de Cesare and all the women of the South, who suffered from oppression, injustice, violence. Good evening! Good evening! What happened? Lost your way? I guess so, yes. I was looking for a petrol pump, and then... - Would you like some wine? - Thanks. The girl who was just here went to get some, thanks. - What girl? - The one with lots of hair. I'm the guardian. I look after the whole house. Sometimes she shows up. It was her, you mean! The ghost of Michelina De Cesare, a bandit woman... Ghost? Yes, It's strange to talk about to a dead person, someone who doesn't belong to this earth, but, it's also strange that an object can move, or that a chair can start flying. If a chair flies, people get really scared. They start making phone calls, run away... And while everybody is surprised, time goes by and dawn comes. And in that precise moment an incredible thing happens, much more incredible than the flying chair. The sun rises, and things change colour. The objects, all of them, change colour, change how they appear. But unfortunately nobody gives a damn about that. They go on doing and saying what they were doing or saying, because this event happens every day and people think it's normal. I think that... I think that from this moment on you will surely meet some ghosts, and will communicate with them because it will be normal. The petrol pump is closed now. I'll find you a room, you can rest, and tomorrow we'll fix everything. Tomorrow the sun will rise. The Certosa of Padula is an incredible place. Achille did this exhibition there. Each artist got his own cell. I went to check out the situation and was struck by the fact that there were no toilets in the cells. I don't know why. So I thought that it was logical to make the missing toilets. PUZZLES Oh, shit! Come, this way it'll be quicken You've got the wrong floor. The artists' cell is on the upper floor! They did the work and left everything right here in front... - Why don't you let me get dressed. - Go, go. SOUTH These paintings are usually done in China. They put the colour on their fingers to pose as... They're not painters. They pose as painters. They're salesmen. But I know this painter! This is Tony Esposito! It's nice that he found his place in life. Maybe he needs money, Because the music field doesn't pay much. They postdate the checks, the galleries also do it like that. All postdated and they bounce, too! Here at Piazza Navona they pay with real money. Today Mark and I exchange art. Mark is a famous painter known all over. Less well-known as a pianist. I am a musician and not well known as a painter. Mark took me back to painting. We're doing some stuff together. But Mark has a lot of strange things. Not strange, fantastic. He often invites me out for dinner, and we go to famous restaurants in Rome, but quite surprisingly I see that he never pays. How's that possible? Are they just being kind? Do they know Mark? I found out later what happens. The restaurant owners in Rome are nice guys: they make me feel at home. Like a family! And they found out that I'm a pretty famous painter and so they always ask me, sooner or later: "Why don't you bring one of your paintings to the restaurant?" - A painting. - And sol do that. But since this is my calling, and I have to get some sort of remuneration for it, we do a sort of... They call it a "barter system". - I don't understand. - It's the "barter system". A business deal: I give them a painting, and they feed me free for the rest of my life. - For your whole life? - Yes! We have a written agreement. I'm constantly doing these business deals. I made one the other day, want to see? I have a signed contract here. "Il Sole restaurant undertakes "to serve an unlimited number of free meals "to Mr. Kostabi and any of his guests, "for his entire lifetime". For the rest of my life. To tell the truth, this thing kind of gets me. Doesn't this thing get you? It's nice! Because we're friends! A big family. I mean... Since these are upper-end restaurants, expensive ones, say one day you have an accident... God forbid! But it could happen. It would be a good deal for them. Well, I don't know... For example, when I came in, the guy asked me: "How's the Maestro?" I said: "He's fine!" But now that you told me about this, maybe it's just my impression, but I got a feeling he was saying: "He's fine, you say?" As if to say, "This guy, ten years down the line..." I'm sure it's me imagining things. Anyway, what you tell me is kind of interesting, Do you have this arrangement abroad, too? Yes. Bruno, have some pizza? This place does it just for me. No thanks, I've had dinner... Do they make these especially for you? They make these "pizzette" especially for me. Little pizzas. Yeah, those are enough for... I mean, if you wanted to... - It's not the quantity, it's the drop. - The quality. Because there's a whole tradition going back to the Avant-guarde movements, but already in the 19th century, when painters used to eat for free in the trattorias, and have their clothes made by tailors and paid them with drawings or paintings. So Kostabi uses art to make payments in kind. It's obvious that Kostabi's and Warhol's mother, who maybe had him in a factory, but he has developed, I would say, certain ways that are typical of the great artist Warhol. In theory, Mangiafuoco is the one who supervises everything. But in practice, too. The ancients called it "Hell", the Flegrean Fields. Because there were thermal waters, there was fire coming out of the earth. Pasolini. Homer. Caravaggio. Stravinsky. Beethoven. Shakespeare. Picasso. Warhol. De Sica. Rossellini. Dante. Verga. Satie. Debussy. Schoenberg. Cage. Van Gogh. Monet. Gaugin. De Kooning. Sofia, you've come home! Now, I have just to find a restaurant where to place you. Here it is, you see? The signed contract! Now, this contract has to be sent immediately to the bank. The signature, everything, and before you know it we'll have the money. Thank God! Listen, since the money is on the way, let's get business class tickets, what do you say? Business class, no? Hey, man, don't make that face... That face... This and London. - How long does it take? - Thirty bloody hours to get there. But there are also coaches that are very comfortable. You know what's up, with these big banks you get delays. We have to make do with the smaller ones, they make more sense. Yeah, but these little banks, all this understanding... Let me tell you something. This hostility, the banks not seeing this project with a friendly eye, I don't mind it at all. Why? Because it proves that we're doing a special project, that very few people understand, almost nobody. Especially the banks. I invented these pockets to carry my paintings inside the art fairs without it showing because there's this notice that says: "No bags and purses allowed inside". Cloakroom. But they didn't say anything about pockets. Anyway, I have two rolls here. I'm a follower of Marcel Duchamp and Joseph Beuys. I believe art should enter into people's homes, directly, without going through the galleries. Sorry, but this is all I can give right now. Good morning, I'm an art vendor, brought you some paintings. Do you have poems, too? - Good morning. - Good morning. - Who are you? - I'm an American artist. I sell my paintings door-to-door. Who is it? So early? An artist. Ask him to come in with his hands in his pockets. - Come in. - May I? They steal silverware, dessert spoons. Hey man, what do you want? I see that you already have paintings in your home... Come up, The American! I once met de Chirico. He came to see a performance where I played the role of a man. He came to me at the end of the show, I had this cap on my head and really looked like a boy, and he said: "Good boy! Well done!" So I said: "Maestro, I'm a girl". And he answered: "Great performance, my boy". This is one of my favourite paintings. Because it has two worlds: a black and white one, and one in colour. Good for you! I'm happy you're buying this one. "and the good wizard place us with Monna Vanna, "and then with Monna Lagia, "and with the one that ranks thirtieth". "So that we might forever converse about love, "and each of them be happy, "and we as well". When you sell paintings in the homes of great artists, you have to be kind of careful, because they also do this exchange of goods. I would say that Kostabi represents an American in Rome. One who moved here, suitcase in hand, and brought from the US a pragmatism, a creative approach so that he does his business from the producer to the consumer. Rino Barillari, it's you! Still here? And "The Great Beauty", finished? Forget "The Great Beauty", it's closed! I've looked in at all the bars! Jackie O'... I went to the Grand Hotel, the Excelsior, no-one around. Strange evening. You know what I'm going to do? I'll take a picture of you. Do me this favour Kostabi, come on! Can you take a picture? Sure, why not. The only picture tonight. Like this. Sorry, who's the girl? Who is she? "Sometimes I would like the garbage collectors to throw me down on the bed, That's better, yes, better Did it speak to you? I think you can express it better, you can face up to this thing of the night, being raped... I'm trying to explain the essence of existence. I would like the garbage collectors to throw me on the bed and do whatever they want with me. Lately lots of people have been saying how beautiful Italy is. In fact, I'm very happy to live here. And so I was leaving. I was leaving that Rome that was asleep, that big-whore Rome, bourgeouis, Fascist Rome. That let's feel good Rome, let's keep going. Rome of the pizzerias, breakfast buns with cream, without cream. I was leaving that penthouse Rome, with Dannunzio, the eternal city, Rome by day, by night. I was leaving that Rome that everyone envies, Rome caput mundi, the Colosseum, the Forum, Piazza Venezia and the Birthday Cake, the Rome that's better than Milan. That faithless Rome, stuffed with employees and rich shopkeepers, the unemployed, the penniless. I was leaving that superficial Rome, full of cheating, payments that are never made, that Rome with all the civil servants and the ministries, the bank employees. I was leaving that Rome that's full of shit! Goodbye, Mamma Roma! Pretty comfortable, isn't it! Yes, pretty comfortable. You can sleep if you like. - Want to sleep? - No, thanks. Have a nap. I'll lower your seat, it becomes a bed. How much does this car cost you per day? I pay very little for this picture car. And this trip, we could just as well have gone with my can With your Panda!? Going to Cannes... It does very nicely, it's not so puny, works quite well. So, is everything ok? We'll go there for the night... The fact is that, I can't lend you any more money. I can't lend you any more, I'm broke. She's calling me... I dont' even have a thousand euros left. Let's try to squeeze through. Then there's Diamante, my assistant, remember Diamante? He needs accommodation. So he can sleep at your place, and then we'll meet in the next few days... Ok, Claude, thanks. Thanks, Claude. Goodbye. You're all set. He was so happy. He remembered you. He said "Oh, Diamante is coming over!" You settle down there. He has a nice room. - Sure? - What? This thing about the room. Of course. Hey, have something to eat don't just stand there... I always have great wish to paint a woman, a naked woman. But fate has always made me paint animals, tigers, airplanes, missiles, tanks... With Lim East meets West, Zen and Buddhism become a method whereby Lim fulfills his art. A falsely figurative painting which in fact tends to highlight the violence of a reality which he controls through form. But in general and in the performances where Lim expresses, an idea of time which is fascinating. In the East time flows in a linear horizontal line and I would say that with Lim it becomes circular. His hula-hoop, for example, his balancing on a ballon, are not only expressions of skill, but a way to control time. Therapeutic, that's Lim's art. Mark? - Mark? - Hi, how are you? - Where are you? - In New York. In New York! I'm on my way back, but would like to know: did you find the money to finish your film? I was about to call you. I'm keeping my voice down because I'm at a meeting with this financer and we've closed the deal, we are his guests for two or three days, a beautiful villa in Cannes... So, you found the money, very good! I'm leaving Friday, getting to Rome Saturday morning early and then we can start. This is a very important project, important names, Mark is a fantastic American artist, so I am quite ready to finance your project. I will contribute to your budget... Wonderful...

Diamante what's the... Why a yellow tie? Because it was dark, I couldn't see... This is a sign. This is a sign. Wonderful. Good! He's got lots of them all yellow. Tomorrow bring all your documents from the bank, ok? Of the Messaggero, add Marchionni, Francesco Marchionni. Yes one more, Giuseppe Cimosa, one more... And add... Ciao, Mark! What are you doing here? - Hi Thorsten! How are you? - Pretty good! - Nice seeing you again! - It's been a while. I can't remember if she's a journalist who is she? Yes, she's a journalist I think she works at the Banca Nazionale del Lavoro. Thank you very much for coming to this conference on my film. You made a film? They made a whole film on me. It's called "My Italy". It's about my life, my painting, my Italian adventure... A masterpiece. You'll like it a lot! I'll be waiting for you upstairs. The manager Kowalski is very sorry that he could not come in person. Please tell the Manager that... I don't know if I understand: the character in your film, which one is he? He is... Let's say from memory, I remember a triptych, a character who's a peasant, a watchman, and then the main character... But let's say I did it. I contributed to this even though I must say that now I don't know if... to be quite honest with you, the film's storyline, all that... It's a crime story, a life history, a noir, a kind of psychological film with an almost French aura, intellectual. A Mediterranean icon. A woman in black for a great love story, a great passion, interested in contemporary art. And I am, naturally, the lead character in the film. It was very interesting to do it... - Bednarski. - Hi Lim. I thought you were in Warsaw. I came today for the promotion of this film I'm acting in. Incredible, Thorsten. This never happens in America. I'm a journalist, I write both for Italy and internationally. - I feel sorry. - Yes, but... - The storyline... - What? - The storyline. - What's that? - The film's storyline? - The film's storyline! - It seemed kind of unpleasant. - No. Want to know what the storyline of the film is? Basically, I'm the main character. I'm a mechanic who's seeking something within himself... and then finds it! - Will he? - He finds it? They have to try to understand each other. We're waiting. They're talking now they have to make friends.
