It's the cops, you guys! Let's get out of here. Let's go, let's go! Faster, Solomon. -Just a sec. Stop it! They're here! Faster! Move it! This is Police, stop where you are! Move it! -Give me a hand, Solomon! Come on! Give me your hand! Give me a hand! -Faster! That's how it is Not mama's baby More like a child of the streets We know every corner of the hood Everything is ours but the houses Daily life makes my head spin Trying to get my shit together And find a quiet place where I can hear myself Plenty of losers around here but there's talent hiding under the rocks I drank in the notes with my mother's milk I drowned the sadness in the lines while the sharks robbed my country I don't remember who I dreamt of being but I knew who I wouldn't be I won't lie, I'll express my pain through my music No use denying what's already been said Who needs it? I don't know And fashionable clubs will never play my music That's how it is, bro... "Final warning before foreclosure" Shit. Hello. -Good morning, Andrei. -How are you? Fine, thanks. Can I help you? Thanks, honey. I'll put your bag here, okay? -Okay. Hello, number 3320160. 60, that's right. Andrei. I got a warning letter about something I didn't pay, can you check your records? What's the charge for? That can't be. Why not? Because I deposited 3,000 shekels just the other day. What interest? Hold on, how am I supposed to cover that? But I don't need a loan! Chris, come and eat! It's your favorite, potatoes. So how was school? I don't want to go there any more. What happened? The teacher doesn't like me. What makes you say that? Can I skip class and just be in the choir? You know how important school is. When I was a kid dad got called in to school all the time. I did a lot of stupid things. Want to hear something funny? Once me and a friend were fooling around and the teacher punished us. She said: "When I come back in after recess "I want the whole classroom to be absolutely clean." "I want the whole classroom to be absolutely clean." And that's exactly what we did. We took out all the desks and chairs. Get it? When she came in she was shocked. "Who did this? Why?" We said: "You wanted the classroom clean, "now it's absolutely clean." You never told me that story. The funny thing is, at the graduation party she said we were her favorite students. I'm not gonna smoke this shit anymore, I just try to believe in the future. Yeah, not a day without rap, it's my own world. Your dream will die if you do not believe in it blindly. We write these texts for the sake of people, One day even my father called me crazy. My girlfriend looks at me silent, she wants love. But my people need my tracks, and I immerse myself in it. I don't remember how many rented apartments I had, But I know for sure that my music was in each of them. Good evening. -Hi. -What's up? Hi. Who remembers where we left off? There's a beats file on the computer. I have a line here... "They pull you by a rope, the government tries to keep you in line." That's the first line. You guys, I have good news. Let's hear it. What is it? You ready? -Ready. -Both of you? We're always ready. -You sure? -We're sure. Check out our tags. Congratulations. Try them on. Our tags. -Kickass! -Let's see. Nice going. -We are stars now. I'll get my picture taken with chicks on both arms. -For sure. Cool, huh? -Yeah. You know, I still can't believe we're performing at the festival. Do you realize what this means? Thousands of people, a huge audience. Listeners, radio, TV, It's our best chance to get our message across. Yeah... Damn, do you know what day it is? We have two weeks... until the show. -So? It's just that... we need a new song, a serious song... in Hebrew. I agree. We may never get a chance like this again. We have one chance and we have to put all our ideas into one song. Right. How? What do I do when I'm feeling bad? Oh, so you remember... I rap! And when the situation sucks... -I look for answers in songs. A blank page in hand. -I'm here and now. -And my mind is clear. Between four walls, between three men, the meaning that changes the world will be born! Come on, Chris. Nastia's here. Chris! Good morning. -Hi. Want to come in? -No, we're late. Where's Christina? Sleepyhead, where are you? Turn around. Be a good girl. Thanks, Nastia. -You're welcome. I can't pick her up, remember? Sure. -Okay. Andrei? Was Mixer with you yesterday? -No, why? He came home late last night so I thought you went out. No. -Okay. Have a good day, girls. -Bye. Move it, no time to waste. Move it. Where does it go? Put the big boxes against the wall and the small boxes on the pallet. Hey. Hello. -Hi. How's it going? -Good. Was it interesting? The usual? Hello. -Hello. Are you Christina's brother? -Yeah. -Hi. I'm Lital, the class counselor. Nice to meet you. -Andrei. Do you have a few minutes? I'd like to talk to you. Sure. -Okay. Be right back, okay? Bye, sweetie. Is something wrong? -No, no. I... I want you to know, I like Christina very much. Really, she's very sweet. -Okay, and...? I'm worried about her, her teachers say she doesn't participate in class, she isn't focused. I spoke to her myself and... she seems a little withdrawn. You know what I mean? She does her homework. Yes. Have you noticed a change in her behavior? Maybe... something unusual? No, she's a good kid. I'd like to visit you at home, get to know the family, see what's what. Mind if I come this week? A rap workshop for kids? That's new. Sounds pretty aggressive. It's not what you think, on the contrary, writing helps them work out their aggression and they open up. I was a troublesome kid and rap helped me make it through. You see, it's... Yes, but I'm not sure it's our sort of thing. Besides, Zura, you don't have the proper training. True, but I'm willing to do a free trial period. Today we'll learn the Windmill. Start from a Baby Freeze. Put your weight on your strong arm... If you rest on your left hand you kick with your left foot. Now, in the middle of the kick... you have to bend your elbow and move to your shoulder. Like this. Got it? Okay. Practice that for two minutes. What's up? -What's up? All good. -How'd it go? They'll call me back. Want some? Maybe they will call. -Forget it, bro, this is the fourth time. When are you here till? Renat, Renat. Nice! Kick a little harder, okay? Way to go. -Anyway... save it for tonight. See you at the show. Bye, Zura. It'll be fine. Don't get bummed. Thanks, man. Bye. -Bye. Yes? -Hi, Mom. How are you? -Hi, honey, we're fine. Still at work? No, it's 10 pm here. I'm at home. And I had a small group today. Good for you. Aren't you exhausted? No, I'm fine. I'll have some tea. Mom, I wanted to ask you, did you get the money I sent? Yes, we got it today, sweetie. You're a big help. Glad to do it, Mom. Well, I'm going to sleep, I'm tired. -Get some rest. Love you. -You too. Bye. Mixer, you nut! How's it going, Andrei? -Fine. So, lets go to my place? -Yeah, Nastia isn't in bed yet and I want to leave something with you. Come on in. What do you need a gun for? It's just for protection. I need you to keep it for a few days, I don't want Nastia to see it. Don't you think Nastia knows? She's always asking where you are. I don't know what to tell her. You know I do it for her and the baby. Oh, you haven't met. This is my new girlfriend, Lucia. Keep your hands off. -You're such a jerk. Move it, you guys! Hold on, I have a phone call. Five seconds. Yes? Hello, Lital. Sure I remember you. No, what do you mean? She isn't in school? Okay. Yes, I'll be done here soon. Thanks. Hello, everyone. How are you? How are you, Dad? I'm always fine when you're here. How are you, son? -Fine. We're managing, don't worry. Sweetheart... Wait a minute, Chris. Look at me. You can't cut school. You need to study, you hear? Promise you'll stop. Okay. Okay? Hi. Come in, sweetie. Thanks, Nastia. -She can sleep over tonight, I'll take her to school tomorrow. -You're sure it's okay? It's fine. Get going. Thanks. And keep an eye on Mixer. -Okay. Good evening. -Hey. How's it going? -Fine. You? Ready? -Yeah, as always. No rehearsals. Let's go. -Good luck. Make some noise! Thank you! Yeah, yeah! That was DJ Chino especially for you. My DJ! Thank you all. Good evening, everyone. Thanks, brothers and sisters, for the good vibes. Now, especially for you, our guests: Andrei, Zura, Renat. Kick some ass! Hey, everyone! What's up, people! Good luck. Where are you running to? You have nothing So you look for answers in the future But they aren't there and there's no reason they should be Something's eating you up inside and driving you on But you live in an isolated world Like a dungeon with no room to stand up or sit You'll get hurt even if you're careful You better move on, you have no choice We have to move on though it's not always easy But the most important thing Is to keep the spirit and the faith We have to move on Though it's not always easy But the most important thing Is to keep the spirit and the faith They say that good defeats evil Maybe it's a myth, maybe it's for real But not everyone can understand the moral of the story And see the world as one Let go, don't run, life is in your hands, be full of joy Light up the world like the sun in the sky Overcome your fears Light the way for others and your optimism will win out Hey, there's a sea of temptations here, buddy War is everywhere On TV there's a show called "Forget Yourself" Their bank accounts are bloated at the expense of the fallen One Georgian and two Russians In a special balanced combination We bring you the sun with our open souls We sing our songs from the heart and in the name of freedom! Didn't I tell you it would work? -Yeah, cool. It always works. -Listen... I told you so. -All those hands and faces... "Keep the spirit and the faith..." Hey, guys. Awesome show. Yeah, it was all right. Say, how's Solomon? -Solomon... He's in the hospital but he's getting better. Send him regards. -For sure. From us. Listen, I have an offer, I have some spray paint here... Let's do it. -I can't, you guys. Come on. -Loosen up, man. Come on. -Let's go. Unfortunately, you haven't kept up your mortgage payments lately. You now owe over 54,000 shekels. That can't be, I make deposits all the time. Can you check your records? I see, but you don't pay in regularly. Can I get a loan? From what I see here your salary varies. I gather you don't have a regular job. I do have regular jobs but I just changed jobs. -I'm sorry, but I can't approve a loan for you. You're way behind, if you don't cover the debt soon you're liable to lose the apartment. Ready? -Let's get started. Everything okay, Andrei? -Fine. You guys, we have a week left, have you written your lines? We'll finish writing now. -Now? Dude, we have exactly one week and this is a world-class show, not some bar. What's your problem, bro? We have plenty of time. You think we have time but we only have a week. What's the problem? -We don't have time. Bro, you aren't the only one who's concerned. Really, Zura... -It feels like I'm the only one. Don't get all depressed on me now. Why don't you get some fresh air and we'll start again. Fine. What's up, Andrei? How's it going? How's your dad? No news. I can see you're in a bad mood. Something wrong? I was just at the bank. I'm deep in the shit, bro. I have a huge debt. On what? Your apartment? Yeah. The interest is killing me. Maybe you can explain what's going on? Hello, folks. What are you doing here? -Making music. Tell them what's going on. -Be quiet. You aren't allowed in here. I have an eviction notice here. You have two minutes to clear out. Got it? Didn't I say two minutes? -What's the matter? You don't belong here, that's what. Don't shout. -I'm not shouting. You were told to leave. I gave you two minutes. Back off. Did you hear what the officer said? Back off. -Back off. We've been here for a year, we aren't bothering anyone. You could be here for 30 years but when you... -Who are we bothering? Did you see the eviction notice? Hold on, I'll handle this. I'm a policeman and you need to listen to me... Listen, we won't budge... -42, they're resisting arrest. If I tell you to go, you go. I don't intend to argue. I don't either. We've been here for a year and a half and we won't leave... That's nice. Now get in the squad car. Leave him alone! Hands off! Hands off! Hands off! Just a minute! -Stop it! I asked to make a phone call. What's the problem? I told you, you can't. Give me the number and I'll call. But I need to talk. Don't give me trouble! I'll put you in solitary! Is that clear?! -Yes! Asshole... When I was a kid I dreamt of being a cop. But I guess something went wrong, otherwise I'd be sitting on the other side gobbling donuts. Don't worry, bro, Mixer picked Chris up. When I was about six my mother took me to gymnastics after school twice a week. On the way we'd stop off and buy donuts like those. They baked them on the spot. We'd sit in the park near the bakery, by the lake, eating donuts and drinking lemonade. I remember it well. I was the happiest person on earth. Hey, crooks, what's up? Hi, good morning. -I hope you didn't drop the soap. Hey, Mixer, is Christina at your place? -Yeah, bro. Don't worry. She's at home with Nastia. -Thanks. -How was it, Zura? Five stars, bro. -Luxury accommodations. Great. -Yeah, we got a little rest. -No, really, how was it? You can guess. Well? -They didn't even let us make a phone call. We lost a lot of time. -You're lucky the cops didn't trump up the charges. -For what? -What do you think? We were worried you wouldn't get out for the audition. Thank God they let you off easy. So what happened? They confiscated all the gear and sealed all the doors. Now you can't even get in. You're kidding. -Damn! Where will we rehearse now? -How could they confiscate the gear? All our stuff was there! Fuck! Did they say what'll happen next? I tried to talk to them but they won't listen. What'll we do? Time's running out. Congratulations... -Fuck. We have to find somewhere new to rehearse. We can try my gym. Anything will do for now. Watch out! What's your problem?! -And he's honking! Fuck off! You fuck off! We just got out of jail. -What're you doing, jerk?! Come on, Mixer. -Fuck off! Come on! -Leave him alone, Mixer. Let's go. -Chill. -I could kill him. Mixer, we just got out of jail. You want to end up in jail again? Let's go. I'm serious. Good morning. What a wonderful start. Let's split up. I'm going. Bye. Bye. -We're splitting up. Meir! -An advance? You don't show up for work, you don't phone in... But Meir... -How can I trust you? But I need the money, it's urgent. Sorry, Andrei, I hired someone else. If I need more workers I'll call you. Hello. Come in, Christina's here. Hey! How's it going, kiddo? -Okay. What's that? -It's for you. Nastia taught me. Take off your shoes. We're just sitting down to eat. Come on in and eat. -Hey, bro. I'll go wash my hands. What's the matter? -I need 54,000 shekels. Lump sum, as soon as possible. For the mortgage? How'd you build up such a debt? Haven't you paid? -Yeah, the mortgage I don't know what to do. I'm deep in the shit. Andrei, you know I'd help you if I could. Maybe you can help me get a loan... from your friends. Are you crazy? Don't take a loan from them, you can't them back and you'll be in big trouble. Thanks. Want some bread? Here. Eat. How was school? -Fine. I took her to school this morning and she walked home alone. She's a big girl now. Why don't you stay with us for now? Is something wrong? He's working night shifts, you want him to sleep alone? Of course not. Stay with us, she and Emma are good friends. Do you want to stay here? -Will you visit me every day? Of course. I'm sorry, Zura. I don't think the rap workshop is suitable for kids in a shchool like ours. They're unbalanced as it is. My sister was murdered when I was 15. She was found in an abandoned building on the outskirts of town. They raped her, then killed her. The police searched for the culprits but I didn't care. I knew she went to some club... with friends that night and... me and her boyfriend tried to find clues. All I wanted to do was find whoever did it and... murder them. But... the police found them first, just three bastards who were at the club and decided she should have sex with them and... she refused. I wanted to kill myself. My mother... I don't know how... I mean... How do you go on after a thing like that? And then, for the first time in my life, I wrote a song. The words came out and the pain came out with them. Then it was bearable. "No Future" I wonder... what someone watching the world from the 35th floor thinks. He doesn't give a damn. What could he be thinking? What makes you say that? Maybe he worked hard to get there. Dude, you got it all wrong, the ones who work like slaves barely make a living. Thanks. Thanks. Yeah... I don't think we'll ever know what he's thinking. There are two many stories between us. Date of birth? -November 19, 1986. Address? 21 Kings of Israel St., Ashdod. Criminal record? -None. Married, single, kids? Not married yet. Can you work weekends and holidays? Yes, anywhere, anytime. Yes, anywhere, anytime. Hey. -Hey. I thought you were at work. -They let us go early. How's it going? -Fine. Let's sit down, I have a surprise. Look what I brought. Tell me about school. -The usual. We watched movies. So now watching movies at school is the usual. Nice. How was it? Good movie. -You liked it? Yeah. I want to act in a movie, too. Who would you play? The bad guy. Why the bad guy? Because the bad guys always win. Chris... we're going through a rough time now but it'll all work out. Are they going to evict us? Why do you say that? -You're no good at lying. I saw the letter from the bank. Good evening everyone, welcome to Jansteel. Nobody goes to the bathroom alone, nobody goes to eat alone, nobody walks around alone. Everyone does what the foreman says. No walking around alone. Have a nice shift. Andrei. Yes? Last name? -Dubinsky. With a D. -Dubinsky. Yes. Will you be here day after tomorrow? -Why not tomorrow? You're substituting three days a week for now. You want to work or not? -Yeah, write me down. But wear closed shoes, okay? Okay. -Last warning. -Fine. Andrei, does Christina like chocolate ice cream? -Yeah. Got everything you want? Almost. Let's go check out. Want one? You're a lost cause. -That's life. How's the new job? -Drop it, bro, don't even ask. Listen. -What? -I can make a little cash tonight. I got a job. Want to come? Can I make what I need? No, but you can make a few thou and maybe more later. Okay. Ask for me. Where are you tonight at 8? In the gym with Renat. I'll pick you up. Bring what I left at your place. Andrei. I promised your mom I'd take care of the family, that I'd take care of Christina and you'd go to college. It's hard without her. She always knew what to do. Don't, Papa, please. It'll be all right. Hey. Yo, Renat. Thanks for letting us rehearse here. -No problem. Here are the keys. -I'll take 'em. The speaker. See you guys. Good luck. Let's get to it. They pull you by a rope The government tries to keep you in line They want you to follow the flock You have to reach the end if you want to see beyond They pull you by a rope The government tries to keep you in line They want you to follow the flock I have to reach the end if I want to see beyond... "I" at the end? -Yeah. Only at the end. -That's good. We should repeat it a few times. -Good stuff. Let's do it a few more times till we get it perfect. We still get mixed up sometimes, at least I do. Put the music on. You guys, we have a problem. What is it? I have to go. -Go? Where? This is our first rehearsal! Go on without me, okay? -We can't, we sing it together. Dude, our audition is in three days. What are you thinking? I totally understand. I'll leave you the lyrics, the music, whatever you need, but I have to go. Try to understand. Bro, what's going on? -Zura, I said I have to go. Where are you going? -I'll explain later. -When? Later, damn it! -When? Stop shouting and I'll explain later. Why don't we rehearse and then you can go? -Zura, I have to go. No you don't. -I'll explain later. When? -Later! Andrei, after we will get to the place. Do as you're told, okay? -Okay. If things get out of hand just step aside. Okay. -Just follow the plan, remember? -Got it. Fine. Don't worry, it'll be all right. Who are they? Sheba, the boss. Did you bring what I asked for? -Yeah. Follow us. Why don't you take our calls? -I'll pay it all back. Where's the money?! -I'll pay it all back, I swear. Where's the money, motherfucker?! Mixer, the bag. No, please! Andrei, grab his legs. Andrei! Come sit down, Al Capone. You think I like doing this? But I was in so deep I couldn't. And I got used to it. You're destroying your family, bro. You're right, but you had a reason for coming here too. Here. Warm yourself up. Thanks. What kind of tea is this? It's called Saigan Daili. It's from Baikal, where I was born. You know, the Buryats say it warms the soul. It must be beautiful there. Just make thick braids. -Okay. Are you nervous? -Yeah. Don't be. You love to sing. Try to relax and enjoy it, you'll sing better, too. When I grow up will we sing together? I'll consider your tempting offer. Okay, I've thought it over. Only if I get to sing the choruses. -Then I'll think it over too. Do you get scared when you go on stage? Of course. Come here. You have a great voice, you're super-talented and you know your part really well. It'll be amazing. I believe in you. Don't worry. Go get ready. I'll be right there. Good evening. -Hi, Andrei, how are you? -Hello. Can we come in? -Sure. This is Orna. -Hello. -Hello. Yes? -Orna is the social worker who works with our school. Orna, this is Andrei. Hello. -This is an important issue so I thought it best to discuss it at home. Okay. Is Christina here? -No. -Okay. I gather your father isn't well, is that right? He's been in the hospital a long time and Andrei takes care of Christina alone, right? -Right. What's the question? -How do you feel you're managing, Andrei? Perfectly well. What's the question? Look, Andrei, I see you're fine with the situation, but think of your sister. -Yes, and...? We're here for her benefit, okay? How do you expect to provide for all her needs? It's not easy to raise a girl alone, and you're still a young man. Yes, but I know how to raise my sister. She's my sister! I see you speak candidly, so I'll be candid with you. I'm not here to attack or threaten you. -Not at all. We know your family is in trouble. -So? We want to check out the situation. -And help. -And try to help. You're here. Now you see? -Look, we can find a permanent solution, there are also temporary solutions. But you must understand, Andrei, that our first priority is Christina's welfare. Wonderful. Anything else? -Don't go on the defensive. We need to cooperate and find the best way to provide Christina with the best conditions possible. -Are you finished? Andrei, let's try... -You've had your say, now let me have mine. I have a great way to cooperate. I open the door and you piss off, okay? -Andrei, we... I don't care. Goodbye. Goodbye! -Andrei, let's talk. Lital... Christina, hurry up, please. Deep in your heart Circles of joy And a hidden light In your living breath Deep in your heart Circles of pain You hate You love Praise Angels will praise you And you won't lose your way In light and in darkness Praise Angels will praise you Small joys will illuminate you Like twinkling stars... He isn't answering. Look what we painted. -What a wall, huh? On City Hall, nice going! It's our response to being kicked out of the abandoned building. Cops. Good evening, what's going on here? Nothing. -Nothing. Empty your bags. Stop. Who are you here to see? -Sheba. Mixer sent me. Turn around, arms out. Don't move. Raise your leg. Whose bottle? -Nobody's. Can I pour it out? -Go ahead. Whose bag is this? -Mine. Whose camera? -Mine. Whoa, can I have my camera back? -Sit down. Okay, just give me my camera, there's personal stuff on it. -Sit down and shut up, I'm not looking at pictures of your girlfriend. 50,000? Yeah. What do you need so much money for? I'm in trouble. It's personal. Personal? Personal is important. I said it's personal. -Go back to your place. This is my place. I said it's personal, get it? They're his personal photos. Give them back, please. I'll count to three. Go back to your place. One! You realize you'll have to work to pay me back. Forget it, Zura, he isn't worth it. Two! What'll I have to do? We'll find you. That's all. Three! Halt! Hello? -Hello, Mom. Renat, honey. I'm so glad you called. How are you? I'm fine, Mom. I'm at work. How are you? The usual. Ira's on vacation. She loved the dress you sent. It snowed today and all the kids ran outside. It reminded me of you when you were little. Isn't it cold there? No, Mom. It's hot here. I'm managing. You sound like you have a cold. -No, Mom. I'm fine. What do you eat? Stop it, Mom. Tell me how Grandma and Grandpa are doing. Grandma and grandpa really miss you. And I, of course, very miss you, son. Yes, how can I help you? -I'm here to deposit the money. How much? -54,000. "They pull you by a rope, the government tries to keep you in line, "they want you to follow the flock You have to reach the end... "They do as they please... As they please..." "The system... "The system screws you, then dumps you, "they do as they please, they want us to sit down and shut up. "It's blackmail, "my soul can't be silenced, it screams..." "Come perform miracles... "Come...

It's blackmail My soul can't be silenced, it screams... Forget it. Later. I remember getting drunk in Ashkelon once. And Artic stood up and clapped his hands, he tried to do a headstand and boom! -Andrei. Bro, I see you're in trouble. I'm really worried about you. Something you want to tell me? Anyway, you guys, I want to propose a toast to you. You'll finally be heard and that means we'll be heard, too. To your success. And one more thing, I think we should order matching shirts so everyone knows who we are. -I'll drink to that. Go for it. -Cool. I know you'll make it. I believe in you. People will finally hear about our lives. I know you'll make it... I'll be right back. Hey, Baldy. -Hey. What's up? We aren't doing anything today. I'm here for your buddy. -Andrei? I worked it out with Sheba. I know he ran away, but we worked it out. Butt out, Mixer, he borrowed a lot of money and now he has to work. Andrei, get in the car. Wait, Andrei. I'll deal with this. Leave him alone, he's a greenhorn. Mixer, he's coming with us. Get in the car. Andrei, you aren't going anywhere. I'll go, it's okay. -I'll work it out with Sheba. Mixer, I'll go, it's all right. -Shut up and butt out. He ain't going nowhere. -Move, Mixer, or we'll go visit your family. Stop it! Stop it, damn it! -Stop, motherfucker! Stop it! Fuck off, you bastards! Fuck off, all of you! Now! Give me the monitor. Careful. The mask. This way. Careful. -Wait here. Put that down. Push. What was that about? What were they talking about? What money? And we're the last to know?! Yeah, I borrowed money from them. You moron! You know what you've done? I had no choice, bro. Why didn't you say something?! Now we're all screwed! -Damn it, Zura... I didn't ask you to butt in. -What's your problem?! Let go! Stop it! Enough! Go to hell... Come in. What happened? Andrei... Mixer's in the hospital. How is he? The doctors are treating him. Wake up, kiddo. Chris. Wake up. Wake up. I want you to go away with Nastia for a while. Come on, let's go. What's the matter, Andrei? -It's all right. Don't worry. I'll explain later. I need you to help me now, okay? Let's go. Will you come get me soon? They're releasing Papa soon. I spoke to the doctor. Everything'll be okay, you'll see. I know you miss him a lot. So do I. But you'll manage until then. I'm serious. Remember how you made me lunch to take to work? That doesn't count, salad isn't cooking. Everyone wishes they had a sister like you. Really, you're kindhearted. Remember that. This is it, little girl. Be strong. See you later. Open up. It's me. Hey. How are you? Let's go outside and talk. I don't really give a damn about the festival. For a minute there I thought we could make a difference. You know... every day I go to that fucking factory and feel like a zombie. I waste ten hours of my life on nothing. I look at the people who've been working there for 15, 20 years, 6 days a week, doing that damned slave labor and they're afraid to lose their job. Once I asked one of them: "How do you keep going? "How can you keep doing this?" You know what he said? He said: "I wake up on Saturday and I want to go to work. "That's how used to it I am." People forgot how to live, they're so used to working all the time, grinding out the hours. They're bored when they aren't working, they have nothing else in their lives. They've forgotten who they are. And the scariest thing is... I'm starting to feel just like them. You guys, we have to do it. I'm serious, I don't care what it takes. Did you see that crowd? It's packed. What do I do when I'm feeling bad? -I rap! And when the situation sucks? -I look for answers in songs. A blank page in hand... -I'm here and now and my mind is clear. Between four walls... Between three men, the meaning that changes the world will be born!
