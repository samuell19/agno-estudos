- In 1940, Hitler's troops invaded France. After the armistice the country was cut in two. On one side Free France, on the other, Occupied France. Between them a veritable frontier along which, day and night, German soldiers stood guard. The demarcation line made use of natural borders, rivers and streams. - Vercingétorix encouraged the Gauls to fight against the Romans... ...and to drive the mister out of Gaul. And to drive them out of Gaul. - You may go. The class is finished... - What happened? Who were they shooting at? - Some unfortunates who tried to cross the demarcation line. - Where were they taken? - To the Kommandantur. Calm down, you should sleep. - After the night I've had, I'll never sleep. Tell me the truth, why have they arrested my husband? Why did they make me leave with the children? - I only know one thing: get to the free zone as quickly as possible! - If we're arrested, what will they do with the children? - I've already got more than 200 people across, it's never happened. With my guide taking you, everything will be fine. Fortunat is truly an ace! - Who's there? Marie-Victoire? - Yes. - I'm here from Jean-Luc. Have the woman and two children already gone over to the free zone? - The children have gone but the mother's still here. - Can I see her? - She's resting. Come with me! - Wait, don't disturb her. She'll have plenty of time to find out. Do you have anything to eat? I've had nothing since last night. I'm famished. - I'll make you an omelette. - No, I don't have time. I must get back before daylight. Listen to me. One of our Resistance friends has been arrested. That's his wife. The Germans are looking for her. They want to get their hands on his family to make him talk. If that happens it will be a disaster. She believes her husband has been arrested by mistake. He hid his activities from her. He adored her. But now she must be told everything. She will need false papers and someone trustworthy to go with her to Toulouse. We have a friend over there who'll be warned. Take his name and address. She must memorise it. - Just a minute. - Martinez, 12 Place des Peupliers. - The guide's here? - No, it's not the guide. - I hope nothing's happened. It's been more than 2 hours since they left. Does he usually come back long after? - It depends on the circumstances. Try and sleep. When Fortunat turns up, I'll let you know. Isn't my bed comfortable? - I can see you've never had a child, mademoiselle! - Shut up! - Did you hear that? - And...when... we're... to...ge...ther... - That's Fortunat. Everything went well. Now, you're going to sleep. Promise? - She hasn't heard anything? Here's the Toulouse address. Don't forget to destroy it. Mademoiselle, we're playing a difficult role. Our main aim is to keep her safe. We've got to take every precaution. You know what would be the best way of camouflaging her? It would be that whoever goes with her to Toulouse can pass for being her husband. She'd have papers in his name, a credible identity, and the children too. - Good idea, but how do we find a husband for a wife around here? - That's for you to work out. This is your neck of the woods. I know I can count on you - Hitler, poo-poo!! Hitler, poo-poo! - Eh? Hitler... ...poo-poo! Hitler... poo-poo! Hitler... poo-poo. So, you want me to scowl at you? - He's had enough of you. and so have I! - I haven't done anything wrong! - No but you're giving us the shits! Why don't you piss off? That looks bad. Trumps, trumps again and 10 to finish! - Oh.. I beg a thousand pardons ladies and gentlemen for having vexed you. - How he goes on! - Well, if a person can't take a joke! Give me a half! - You'll get nothing more to drink! Resole my boots first, you've had them for three months! - Out of leather, out of leather! Wasn't me made the partition... - There are more fish in the sea than you... - The fish are in the free zone. Come on, give me a drink! - No. - You don't want to give me a drink? Good, I won't come back! - Oh that I should be so lucky! - Good!... Good... Ah, just in time! Welcome! - Fortunat, old friend, you'll drink a toast with us? - Ja! A half! - Zwei bier! - You got to serve me now! Look! - Was ist das? Ein fisch? Für mich? Prima! - Für mich... mais tabac ...eh? Oh say... you're kidding me? Shcuze me... rat-face! What do you know...! Good, that is fine. There you are. It's a beauty. - Hitler... poo poo... Hitler... poo poo... Hitler... poo poo... - You see... with your foolishness! - Poo poo... Hitler... ...poo poo. - Cover the cage, for God's sake! Will you shut up you stupid little fool! - Fortunat, the school mistress wants you. It's urgent. - I better go... Goodbye everybody! Do you see it? He's going to cop it! - What does your mistress want? - You can go how. Boudouch, you stay here. - It's always me who gets it! - Write out 100 times: "It's always me who gets it." And rightly so! Off with you! You see, every year I have a bad egg, like you. It's funny though... they're the only ones who come back to see me. Follow me! Go ahead! - Mademoiselle... I order you, - I want a sweet? - Aren't you ashamed to get yourself into such a state? Don't you know that alcohol degrades a man? ... and days when it helps. You can't deny that. - Good, then you don't get a sweet! - Aw... - Get up! - What are you saying? - Stand up! Don't you understand French? Ye..es, not brilliant. Turn around! Walk! - Where am I going?... - To the door and back. Ye..es... At least it's better than nothing! Go on... sit down! Tell me Noél, can you go 8 days without speaking and without a drink? - Without a drink... - Yes... Noél, you've already travelled? - Yes, I been to Romorantin... to the recruitment board. And to Vierzon, for my aunt's inheritance. I got her bed! I didn't know beforehand, else I wouldn't have bothered! - To sum up, you've never been out of the province! - How many provinces in France? - Well... ah... - Don't tire yourself, there are ninety. Shit, France is large! - Would a trip across France be nice for you? - That'd be great. To go where? - To Toulouse... with the children who've been staying here and their mother. - She's a real lady, eh?... - The married couple should give each other faith, security, assistance. The husband is the head of the family. - Be quiet and leave that alone! - Mummy, who is head of the family? - Your daddy. And from today, that's your daddy there! - Hey, gently! Passengers for Clermont-Ferrand, Brive, Montauban, Toulouse... - Ah, there are two in here, like always... Pardon, madame. Pardon! Excuse me! - I think these seats are taken. - Ah..well, we'll go. - I can't go on, let's sit down. Noél, be a dear, and put the bags on the rack. - That's made me hot. Shit! - Mummy, he said a bad word. - Forget it! Please watch your language, the children repeat everything. Maurice, stay here. - I want to look out the window. - Very well. - The train, it's like going on holidays. Have you been to the seaside? - No. I've never seen the sea! I, I've been on the Céte d'Azur. And to the mountains? - No. - You've never seen a mountain? - No I haven't! - Well, I've been to Megéve. It's super. Can you ski? - What?... Uh, no. - The snow's beautiful. I bet you've never been out of France? - You win! - I was born in England. Are you English? - No! And you, do you know how many provinces there are in France? - 90! - Yes... Pardon! - Me, me! - Take turns! - And your mother, you think she isn't dry as a chip? - No glasses? - No. - No thank you. - Want some? - Yes. Go on... have a drink! - No, thank you. - I heard that in Paris they go quicker than this! - Be quiet! - Don't look too closely... it hasn't been lived in for a long time. It needs a sweep, but it's not fatal! You'll be left alone here. No one will look for you you! You'll need to air it out! Some floor tiles are missing. It's not fatal! I'll lead the way. All the bedrooms open onto the hallway. It's quite convenient. And here we have the combined kitchen and dining room. Look! Before you, the most beautiful view in Toulouse. You wouldn't have expected that! - No, I wouldn't have expected that. - And you haven't seen anything! Come and see! - Mummy, it's like on the Eiffel Tower, you can see all the roofs! - I want to go to the Eiffel Tower - Come quick, there's an attic! - What do you think of that? On a clear day, you can see the Pyrénées! And the washing's dry in an hour! - Tell me... do you know what time the Chateauroux train comes? - The train from Paris? 6:20... you've got time! - How many rooms are there here? - Whatever you need! Come on! There's one bedroom. The little ones can sleep here, head to foot. It's not luxurious but it's not fatal! And at night you're asleep! And here's the second bedroom! I've slept here a night. You could see the moon and the stars... it was splendid! You'll need to draw the curtains if you don't want to wake up at dawn. It's not hard..there!! - Mummy, I need to do wee-wee! - Come on little man, I'll show you. - You see, it's that door there. It's for you and the neighbours. They're nice. They're Jews. - Maybe I know them... - We can't stay here. - Why? - It's just too uncomfortable. The children aren't used to such a place. It's impossible. I'm sorry... - So where will you go? You've got to realise Toulouse is full of refugees, you'll find nothing! - At worst we can go to a hotel. - In your situation... you're out of your mind! - Mummy, the toilet's funny... you can't sit down! - Come here! Don't be scared. What's your name? - Myriam. - That's a funny name. Are you from Toulouse? Where does that name come from? How old are you? - Ten. Are you refugees? - No, we come from Paris. - We too! Mummy, refugees from Paris! What's your name? - Maurice. - Mummy said to ask if you need anything. - We're not going to live here... it's not comfortable enough. - We think it's OK. - In Paris we had 3 bathrooms. - 3 bathrooms! What does your father do? - He's a great doctor. - Myriam, your afternoon snack! - Papa, do you know, they have 3 bathrooms! His father is a great doctor. - You see... even great doctors can't practice. - That's my whole fortune. Sell them best you can. - I'll try. What a beauty! Isn't that magnificent? That must come from the Place Vendome. It's worth money. It's a shame that selling now, gets a fraction of their value. Still! - I have no choice. That's all I have left. - I'll give you a receipt. - I trust you. - As you should. - When do you want me to come to your place? - I'll bring you the money when I've sold all this. - Not this one. - She doesn't want much. - For me, yes. - Fine, I'll leave you be. The less we see of each other the better. The less you go out, the better it would be. There's no shortage of police and militia around here. Hang in there! You're well hidden here... no risk. - I'm going... I'll be back. - Tell me, it's none of my business, but, do you have to leave tonight? - They need me in the country. - You do what you have to, but it would be better to stay a day or two with her, in time she'll get used to it, but she doesn't seem to be up to... coping all alone. She might do something stupid. OK then, maybe we'll meet again! - Au revoir. - It seems they're going to ship out in a week or two. It's not too soon! - Au revoir. - We're leaving, Noél. we'll find something more habitable. - You can't leave. - Who's going to stop me? - It's orders. - Let me pass. - Madame, I can't. - What right do you have...how dare...? - You must stay here. There's no getting out. - Out of here! - Shh! - Shit... it's good! But you won't know... - Faster! - Come on... get a move on! - Come in, messieurs-dames. Come in! - So, doctor, the big clean-up is finished? - Oh yes. What a job! I never worked so hard! - Bravo! Incredible, in just a week! When we came, it took us 2 months. And our place wasn't as dirty. No comparison! - My wife's a fuss-pot. - Women like things neat and clean. - Bonjour, Madame Fortunat. All my compliments! - Without you, how would we have done it? Right Noél? - Your ladder was a big help. - That's the way it is between refugees. If we don't help each other, who'll help us. Can I have a look? - Please come in. - Pardon. Thank you. - The same window as us! You're not too hot at night? - In summer I sleep outside. Without the terrace I'd be miserable. Come and see the children's room. - This is M. Levy's apartment? - No. - He arranged ours. - I sometimes have giddy spells. What do you think it might be? - Haven't a clue, I've never been sick! - You're a wag, Doctor! - Eh?... - I've made some lemon squash. I hope it's fresh. - There was nothing missing... we'll see. - I love lemon squash. - I prefer a snort. - What class are you in, Myriam? - I'm going back to 6th, madame. - Maurice is also going back to sixth, but he's a year older than her. - We're wondering if it will be better for Miriam to do Classics or Modern? What do you think? - Uh... Modern's better isn't it? - Maurice is going to do Classics. - It's the women who always have the last word, eh? - You have an adorable child. - Since your boys have been here, she hasn't been the same. - She wasn't laughing so much. In Paris we wore the star. That atmosphere was oppressive. When I think of the youngsters left in Paris, my heart feels tight. - Lets talk about something happier. What news of the war? - It's one in... It's one in the eye for Fritz! - Please excuse us, I have a student for a piano lesson. - Certainly. - Thank's for the lemon squash. Coming, Sam? - If you ever need a complete one I'll give you prices. I also do women's wear. I was a cutter at Lanvin. - Have you been there long? Come on. - They're nice people. - They called me doctor. - My husband's a surgeon. Maurice must 've told the little girl. - They certainly took me for your husband, then. - Sam, didn't you find Dr Fortunat rather odd? - It takes all sorts... - They don't go together. - I'm telling you right off, they're not a proper couple. The little one is his, not the big one! - You're right Sam, that's it for sure. - One more time! - She's from good family. He...working class. You remember the book: "Lady Chatterley's Lover"? - But you're right Sam, that's it for sure. However... she has a rather sensual air. - That's even worse! - How do you know? Here...pass me ... - I don't want to chase you, but you'll have to finish in time for the train. - I'll leave in the morning. I'm only a day behind. - Mademoiselle Massilon will be furious, you should've left 8 days ago. - Are you going away Noél? - Well..when I've finished the shower, I'll have to. - I don't want Noél to leave us! - Don't carry on, I haven't left yet! - Pierrot, don't you know another one? - Noél, do you know another one? - I? I know heaps! I was a wedding singer in the country! People like that one! Aaagh.. fucking shit, shit! Aaagh, shit! Excuse the language, but that was over-the-top painful! - I'm not hurting you? - Ah no... that's really fixing it. - Amentou, the pharmacist, doesn't have such a gentle touch. With you... - With me... what? - Well, with you... ...a man could bang himself on the finger from time to time. - Pierrot, eat properly! - I'm eating like Noél. - Bravo! - I don't want you to go away, I want you to stay with us! I want you to stay with us. - I'll come back soon. - Bon voyage, Noél. And thanks for everything. - Oh no, I don't want it. - Yes, you've earned it. Noél you're going to make m angry. - I don't want to make you angry. OK then, I'm off. Au revoir, Maurice. See you soon eh...? Au revoir, madame. - Are you glad to get back? - Well... yes and no. I'd got used to being here with you all. It feels strange to be leaving. It feels we've known each other for a long time... for a long time... Well, I really must be off. Ah, I meant to say one thing! To freshen the air, you need to put a virginia creeper on a a trellice in the corner - Great. - Fine, I'm off. If I'd had time, I'd cook something together! Wait, in the kitchen... - You're going to miss your train! - OK, I'll shut up and run. So, au revoir. - Au revoir. Fortunat, our man of the woods has finally decided to leave. "He didn't want to go and I would have had to dismiss him. "He was a fine fellow but really uncouth." - Maman, come quickly, it's full of smoke! - My eyes are hurting! My eyes are hurting! - Out onto the terrace, don't stay here! - Noél, come back! Come back Noél! Come back, come back! - I'll miss my train! - Noél, come back, Noél! - Is it that range? - Yes! - I'm coming! - Is Monsieur Tonio in? - He's out for a minute. Anything I can do for you? - No... Tell him Madame Fortunat is here, he'll understand. - Just a moment, madame. Do you have your papers? How long have you been in Toulouse? - About 2 weeks. - Why did you come here to Toulouse? - To look for work... with my husband. - What does your husband do? - He's a... shoemaker. - Hm... Where do you live? - 12 rue des Peupliers. - You aren't within the regulations. You'll have to change your address. - What did you want with Mr Tonio? - I've given him my watch to sell. You don't know if he's sold it? - I was going to ask him. Come with me. You know her? She makes out that she's consigned something for you to sell. You have a receipt? - No. - Here, check out this ID for me! - This little plant's going to climb up to the roof? - It'll grow faster than you. By spring it'll be past you. By next summer, it'll be higher than me. In 2 years it'll run all over the wall up to the roof tiles! What am I saying? In 2 years the war will have been finished for ages! - It's mummy, It's mummy! - No, she's got a key. - Monsieur Fortunat? - That's me. - Your ID! - Oh... I'll just go get it out of my vest. - That's strange, I can't find your name. When did you leave your watch? - The 15th or 16th of September. - I can see nothing on those dates. - Everything's in order. If you'll just have a look over this tray, your watch is sure to be found there. - Here it is. Thank you. We have to hurry... the children are alone. Au revoir, Monsieur. - Why did you only take that watch? - A shoemaker's wife doesn't have jewellery. - Why not? - What's up...Not feeling well. It'll pass. - We'll take a drink, it'll pick you up. - A "Fernet-Branca"! I haven't served one since '37! Something for every taste! And a bottle of ordinaire! - Thank you. - Poor Tonio! If you'd seen him, it was horrible. When I think that my husband is in their hands. - Have a drink, it'll pick you up! - Ah! - Not nice, but it'll do you good. At home, it replaces the doctor, it cures everything. - What will become of us? I haven't a sou left. - I've still got some. Wait... look what we've got! - Enough to stop us dying of hunger for a few days... then what? - Then... then we'll see. Don't you fret about it. I was lucky to miss my train! - You're very kind, Noél, but I can't accept. They're waiting for you at home. - Nobody's waiting for me. I'm not going to leave you all alone with the children! - And Mademoiselle Massilon? - If she was here do you know what she'd say? I can hear her as if I was there: "Noél, your mission isn't finished. You've accompanied those people to "Toulouse, that's fine. You've set them up, "that's even better. Now that she hasn't a sou left, "you're not going to leave her in the lurch! "You must take care of them! Get them out of their fix... work! "I know you're lazy, but you have an obligation! So... that's what my mistress would have said! - Noél... - Meanwhile, if it is not inconvenient, send me a money order, for what you can. ...as an advance. I'll pay you back. Noél... ...Fortunat. "- In my anguish, I thank God for having struck on my way "a good, simple man, that I treated like one of the servants. I'll never forgive myself." - Ay-ay-ay! When are the Russians going to stop retreating going to stop retreating? - They know what they're doing! - Mummy, you know what Maurice told me about going back to high-school? It's a secret. - I can't tell it. - No, you shouldn't tell it. - But to us it's not the same thing. - A secret's a secret. - So...? - Monsieur Fortunat, isn't his father. - What did I tell you? - It was me who told you! - What's it matter! - His real father is a great surgeon named Valecourt. Monsieur Fortunat is a nobody. - That name rings a bell. So where does Monsieur Fortunat come from? Who is he? - I don't know. - But I know. It's like in 'Lady Chatterley', but here it's the chauffeur or the butler. Get it? - You're right, Sam, that's it for sure! - I give up guessing. - Me tool - Chef! - Oh! - My turn. - Pierrot, Maurice, your snack! - Ah! - That's all? - There'll be a bit left to have for dinner. - What are you doing? - I'm eating chicken. What a re you eating? - Pheasant... it's yummy. - I've never eaten it. - Here... have a wing! - Mmm, it's delicious. Do you want some of my chicken? - No, I'd rather eat this. - Me too... I want some pheasant! - Close your eyes, open your mouth. There's a drumstick! - It's chocolate! - Stupid! - Myriam! How about some piano? - Me too, I play piano. - Yes? Come and show us. You know something by heart? - Yes. - It's scandalous! - What's the matter? - How on earth...? ...you have a child who plays piano like an infant Mozart, and you never told me, ...me who's devoted my life to the piano! Who's he learned with? - "Preverescu". - "Vladimir Preverescu?" Once I would have sold myself to take a lesson with him. Why didn't you send Maurice to me? - Things are a bit tight at the moment, but when we can... - That doesn't matter! Pay after the war. - No, I couldn't accept. - I won't listen to you. Listen to that... - Maurice is going to take a lesson every day. Starting immediately! Black pudding Coupons AZ - June - Madame. - You don't have a preference? - No. - What have you brought? - What have you brought? - Lyon sausage. I did some work for a delicatessen. - Yummy... I love it! - Oh, what a lovely thought, Noél! Everyone sit down! - When are you going to work at a cake shop? - It's not easy to find work in a cake shop. I've tried, but I never made it. - Me neither, I never made it, it's as hard as wood. What the...? ...It's imitation, Noél! - What? The thieves! - Sell it, Noél. - If it's going to upset you, you should keep it. Today I might get some work. - Sell it. Nothing's more important than feeding the children. - OK. Don't worry, - If the little man is not dead, then the little man will live again! - Excuse me, the Fortunats' place, is it left or right? - It's in front of you! Fortunat, this is he! - I've got a money order for you. - Just in time...I'm out of cash. Thank you. My dear Noél. You made 17 mistakes in your letter. I'm sending you 1,000 francs anyway. I... I'm proud of you of the idea that you are working to keep your family alive. You prove to me by your conduct that... ...bad boys are often better than the good ones. On receiving your card, - I've lifted the punishments on all the dunces in the class. There! - One more time! - Bonjour, Monsieur Fortunat. Tell me just between us, did my wife's fish go down alright? - Well.. you know... - Mine neither. She makes it once a week. With the rationing, - I hoped not to see it again, but it keeps on coming! I don't know how she does it. - Noél, the Chapuis have sent me my bags. - About time! - And my ring? - There it is, your ring! - Oh! Oh, sweet condensed milk, the children will be delighted! - The allies have landed in North Africa! - We heard it on the radio. - The war's over. Hugs for everyone! This is a great day, the war is over, the war is over! Soon we'll all be going to Paris. - If the war's finished, why cry? - Look... the flag! "- Since the arrival of the Germans, "we haven't dared to go out. Alas, our neighbours have "even more reason to hide. "Noél is in charge of general provisioning. "He has at last found a job. He's gardener "on a big estate." - If the mistress saw me, she'd fall on her bum in surprise. - Your parcel. It's 900 francs. - It's gone up! - If you don't want it... - Yes, give it to me. There you are. - Au revoir. - When it arrived in town there was a revolution. It looked good! - You scared me! Were you there long? - No. - Why didn't you say anything. - Well... I was looking at you. - They're pretty... such beautiful flowers. - They're for you. - I adore chrysanthemums. - You could have had others. And what do you say about these? There's enough to make chips. - Flowers and chips at the same time... I'm fulfilled! - I do what I can. - And your job? What a nice occupation, Noél! You cultivate your garden, like Candide. - I don't know if I'm like him, - But it's nice not having to talk. - What would we do without you? - Here. - What's that? - My pay. - No, it's yours. - You're the boss, the boss holds the purse-strings. - Keep a bit for your young man. - What young man? That's what's needed here A wife, children... - I'm going to peel the potatoes. - I'll give you a hand. You do long peels. Look at mine. Like this. - You've learned things from me, Noél. - You too. - I am hungry! I am hungry! - Sit down everyone. - I have something for you. - Oh, Noél! How nice! You didn't sell it. - Attention... Midnight! - Midnight! Ah!... - Monsieur Noél Fortunat? - What do you want? - Your wife sent me. - It's me. - Hard to find you. She told me that you were looking after an estate. I asked at the Town Hall. Mademoiselle Massillon told me. - Good... I thought you were police. I haven't told my wife I'm a gravedigger. That might scare the children. How is the mistress going? - Good, but I have a problem. - Do you need something? - To hide an American flyer. - I don't have any room. - A cupboard would do. - Well, if it's like that... - He must be taken to Perpignan after tomorrow, to this address. - In the house...yes. But travel with him...no way! - I have a wife and 2 children. What if something happens to me? - 1 pilot rescued shortens the war by 8 days. He must get to Spain. I need 48 hours to organise things. Don't let me down. - OK, bring on your pilot. - Not necessary, he's already at your place. - Hi Noél, you know about this? - Yes, he can sleep in the attic. What's he doing under the table? - What dis he say? - That he's pleased to meet you. - What'd he say? - He asked if you speak English. - You speak it well. - Set the table, I'll change. Keep an eye on the chicken, we've got a distinguished guest. - To have a drink needs no understanding. It's always OK. - You may be right. To you! - He's downed 3 German planes. - I'm going to get my iron. - You need it? - May be, why? - If they wanted us to meet him they would've said so. - If we'd had an American here, we would've invited them. - We are us... and they are them. - I'll have them taste the cake. - No need to be indiscreet. - Go and find your mother. It's going to be overcooked. - You go. We're playing with Tom. - Tom...! What a mess! Upside down, what's that look like? You coming? Otherwise no one will be able to compliment you. - Just a second. - Just a second, just a second... - I'll go by the terrace. And watch by the window. For just a minute, Sam. - Rosette, that's just not done. - An American aviator..right here... May be he knows my New York cousins. And you stop me from seeing him! You're a rotter! - I don't want them to become anti-Semitic. - Sit down everyone. Yum-yum. - Yippee! - If your mother doesn't come soon, there'll be no more gravy. - You're so pretty! Like in Paris. - What'd he say? - Nothing... to explain. - He talks all the time but he says nothing. Come on! He wants to dance at the neighbours. - Super, I'm going with Mummy. - I'm going to bed. - Goodnight, then. - You've got what you want. - No... we should have been able to have dinner together. It wouldn't have been much trouble. And... if someone's stubborn... Bring out a bottle. - What a nice surprise. Your wife said you'd gone to bed. Come and have a drink. - It's over. We got to leave. - Are you mad? - He's supposed to be going to Perpignan. - He was supposed to stay here tonight. - He'll sleep on the train. - You've been drinking. It's not supposed to be tonight. - I know what I'm doing. Get going. - I'd never endured such humiliation. What a mistake to have accepted this situation. With such an uncouth man. Fortunat thought he had rights because he gave me money. I should reimburse him after the war. Was he jealous of Tom? It's quite impossible for him to stay with us a day longer. - When's Noél coming back? - Soon. - Will he take me to school tomorrow? - No. From now on it'll be me. Won't that be nice? - I like it with Noél better. When's he coming back? - I don't know. Have you finished your page? - Mum, how do you spell "allumette"? - Two L's and one M. - How many T's? - Have a look at the timetable for the train coming from Perpignan. "Allumette"... 2 T's. - Isn't he back yet? He may still come. There's a train in at 11:15. - I know. He wasn't on the 11:15. He's been gone 3 days. How could I have been blind? How could I have had such low feelings about him? His outburst was a declaration of love. Noél! - Mummy, is Noél back? - No, darling. Go to sleep. - Anything? - Nothing. She's in a frightful state. I didn't know she liked him so much. She likes him because he's not here. - Poor man! You saw how she was dancing with the American. - If there'd been another pianist, you would've danced with him too.. At the piano, you kept your eyes shut. - It did shock me. - Here I am. - Noél, you've been gone so long. Noél, you're alive. Thank you God. I'd been so frightened I'd lost you. - It wasn't that far...but... Tom and me had a rough time. He's not a bad sort. - Noél, if you only knew how we missed you. - I won't leave you again, I swear. Noél, darl... - Noél, would you pass me some paint? - Maurice, look! - Papa! Our house! - With three bathrooms? - No, that's at Neuilly. That one there has four! After the war, I'll invite you there. I'm going to show this to Mummy. She'll be so happy. - Doesn't that suit you Noél? - What do you think? With a few adjustments, it'll be perfect. - You only owe for the making. The customer's paid for the material. - We'll take it. - Monsieur Fortunat? - Jews in the city have been arrested. Don't stay in your house. - I know.. but where can we go? - They've landed in Italy. We'll be in Paris for Christmas. - Listen, I can hide you at the cemetery, I know the caretaker. He's hidden Jews in a chapel. There's one left free. You'll need to sleep there tonight. - Tonight? Impossible, Myriam has her French exam tomorrow. - Let's face it Rosette, we've got to go. You're a true friend. Rosette and our daughter will go. But I have to deliver a suit in 2 days. - We're not going without you. Alone at the cemetery, I'd be frightened to death. - The dead aren't as wicked as the living. - No Monsieur Fortunat, I'm not going. We haven't been apart since our marriage. - That's true. Not a single day. There's no way of getting away from that. - It's not wise to wait. Your colleagues have been there since yesterday. - It's good to not be alone. Monsieur Fortunat... Let me kiss you. - Don't say anything to Juliette, about the cemetery. She'd get in a stew. - Maurice, would you like to invite Myriam to sleep at our place? - Super! - Go and get your things. - That's lovely, thank you Madame. - She'll sleep with me! - Your papers please. - What is it? - Germans... they want our papers. - Maurice? - They are your 2 boys? - Yes. - And the little girl? - My niece. - Thank you, Madame. - Sam, your glasses? - I can't find them. - They must be on the piano. He can't see anything without his glasses. - It doesn't matter... schnell! - Mummy! - Don't move! - Mummy... Don't leave me... Take me, take me! - Maurice can play, every day. - Take my piano... without fail... - Weg! - I'll never forget... Don't cry, my little darling. We'll see them after the war. - Leave me alone, don't touch me! - Oh, my God... - Noél, you don't need to... Your employers will notice it. - They're never there. A few flowers more or less... They can't keep account. - Maurice? Did you put the photo of your father in my room? Answer me? - Yes, I did! If you don't want it, I can take it. That's easy. - No... leave it there. Since the arrest of our friends, - Maurice hasn't spoken to me. I can't stand the way he stares at me. Noél must understand. But how do I explain to him? - Juliette... Juliette? - Good day darling. - Good day, mummy. - Do you like that? You can thank Noél. It was hard to bring it in here. - I didn't ask for it. Remember? This is the piece my father liked. - This will be your liberation. You have been waiting 4 long years. Without hope, in the darkness to which you were plunged. 1944 will be the year of your liberation, - Of that you can be sure. - London calling. - Dinner time! Pierrot, go and wash your hands. - Before we sit down... Let's pray for those who aren't with us. They are in our hearts. For Daddy... For Myriam... For Monsieur and Madame Falk. May God let them return this year. Let us pray for peace. OK then, sardines or pork-paste? - Sardines! - Meat-paste! - OK to give presents? I'll be back. - It's for you. - Noél, you're mad. - Try it. - No bicycle bought on the black market. With black market money. - You'll see! - You've got no right... I know I've no right to anything here. Except to work. There! - Get out Maurice, I don't want to see you. I've done everything to support you. But I never accept contemptible behaviour ...from anyone! - Noél, I like you better than anybody. - Watch out for the pedestrians! - That all? - Whew...! hang about...! - Noél, did you see the flag? - Sure. - Tomorrow it won't be there any more. - Why? - Maurice is going to take it. - What? - He told his pals at school. I heard him. - When's he taking it? - I don't no, but tomorrow it won't be there. - They have to get another flag from Berlin. Hitler is still furious. On English radio, de Gaulle congratulated Toulouse. - Maurice took the flag! - Maurice? - Shut up! - You're crazy, I never said that. - He did say it! You're a liar! - Maurice, tell the truth. - I said it as a joke. We'll pinch the Kommandantur's flag. It was just pretend. - Well... I got this for peanuts... This garbage keeps you warm. - Noél, it was you? - Yes, to stop the children doing something silly. - You've got guts. - I have 3 children. The biggest one is the worst. To risk your life to be talked about. - At night I don't get dizzy. Here, you can show this to your mates. - You're terrific! - Terrific! - Full gallop. - Faster horsey! - Off we go... - Careful. - French men and women, now is the end of your troubles. Get ready to help the allied troops who are coming to liberate you. French troops have not ceased fighting. Liberation is hard but certain. - They said the same thing 2 years ago. I don't believe that about a landing. - That's your school when you were little? - Yes, the school mistress is going to be surprised when she sees me. I have an idea. We'll give her a surprise. You go into the classroom and say: "Mademoiselle, one of your naughty pupils, ... wants to see you in the yard". Say it for me. - Mademoiselle, one of your naughty pupils. One of your pupils... Who's waiting for you in the yard. - Go on! - Hurry. Go on... Go on! Oh... Go on... - Mademoiselle, one of your pupils... Who's waiting for you there. A naughty boy - Quiet! - Oh.. I'm sorry, - Mademoiselle Massillon isn't here? - You don't know? She was shot by the Germans in 1943. - Shot? - A plaque has been put up in the yard. On the spot where it happened. - Are you upset, Noél? - Is that him? - What's different about him? - A woman. - I'd like her to give me the recipe. - That's hard. - Madame Dubroc, please. - Monsieur Fortunat - Do you have any Balkan yoghurt? - What yoghurt? - From the Balkans, it's a country. - I've never had that. - It's excellent for your health. The lad has it for evening dessert. Pity... Give us a piece of fruit. - Yes, Monsieur Fortunat. - And afterwards... some tea. - Tea? I don't have that either. - Either you play or stare at Fortunat. - You give me the shits, I can watch him instead. - So... you've come back to the country? - Not for very long. I'm rejoining my wife soon, in Paris. The little one could do with some fresh air, so... - You're married? - Almost. As good as. - Who would have believed it? - We must get around to it some day. - One doesn't want to live alone. - Your health... and your wife's. - Don't move. I'll show her to you. The four of us at Toulouse. Not a good photo. She's better than that in the flesh. Have a look. - What about that! - You have another boy? - Yes, the older one... Always first in his class. A bit stubborn... it's the age. - Where's their father? - The father?... He's dead. In Germany. - Poor woman. - All those deported stay there. - Not all. - You know Titi Rousseau? - The 'ferryman'? - Yes, he was arrested. Sent to Buchenwald. He's just come back. Not a pretty sight. He doesn't weigh 35 kilos but he's here. Not many of them came back. Were they arrested long ago? - Just after you left. What's up? You look under the weather. - It's just that this news has knocked me a bit. - A drop... - No thank you, I'm going to have a lie down. Titi Rousseau was a hell of a guy, at least a 100 kilos. They weren't all like that... unfortunately. - Noél. A telegram from Paris. - Open it. - "Return to Paris immediately". "Kisses, Juliette". - What? - "Kisses, Juliette". - We're going to Paris! We're going to Paris! - Mummy! Mummy! Mummy... Mummy... - The Paris station's big, eh? - My husband has returned, Noél. I didn't want to write you. I wanted to be with you to tell you. He's suffered terribly. If you knew what they did to him. I hardly recognised him. But I thought about you so much. And I told him what you have been to us. - Everything? - No. - How long's he been here? - A fortnight. - And we went on fishing. - He has had his son back for several days. - Noél. - I know that statue. - Come along, Pierrot. - Hi Noél. It's great to see you in Paris. Come on, I've lots of things to show you. - Let Noél be. - I caught a trout... that big! - True? - How is he? - Uneasy. He's made some progress. He's asked after you. He's impatient to see the little boy. - Pierrot, do you remember the house? - It's like when I was little. - Do you remember the man who played the piano here. - He had all the books there. - That man was your daddy. - He went on a voyage. He's been very sick. He really wants to see you again. - No, Noél's my daddy. - No, darling. Noél isn't your daddy. Come along. - I don't want to go there. Noél will come with you if you like. Come on, Noél. My husband is anxious to meet you. - I don't want to. - I'm pleading with you. - He's waited a long time. - Come on. A wardrobe for your things. Your bathroom. Pierrot's bedroom. You won't be far away. You'll be happy here. - I'm leaving, Juliette. - What are you saying? - Two men in one house is one too many. - Our life's finished. - Not at all. We all need you. The children, me... It won't be the same as Toulouse You must understand. - There won't always be war. - We'll buy you a house. - I don't want anything. - You could have a café by the sea. Dancing on Sundays. - Playing bowls. How am I going to live without you? Tell me, Juliette... - We'll see each other often. The children will go to your place. - I'm not going back to the country. - I'm not going to hassle you, Noél. You can stay here as long as you wish. A fortnight, a month even. If you'd like that. I was talking about the future. - I'll be back, Noél. - Noél! Mummy, mummy! Noél has left! - Noél! Come back, don't leave. - Noél... Mummy, has he left for ever? - Yes. Yes, for ever.
