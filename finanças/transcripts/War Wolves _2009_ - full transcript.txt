Hi. How's your head this morning? You put up a hell of a fight yesterday. Hmm, yum, made a better dinner than it does breakfast. Oh, come on, Jake, most men wouldn't look so disappointed waking up with three women. Powerless, is that what the world is trying to teach you now, Jake? Doesn't it feel better not to rely on those pills, those drinks, just lettin' your body heal on its own? You don't even have a hangover, do you? It's okay. He's got it in him too. Give up on him. He's done. We don't need him. We do. You brought us here for him to lead us. Look at him. The strength inside of him will crush you. Leave us. It's okay, it's part of the process. Process of what? Well, I actually don't know it yet, but I know it's something amazing. Do you remember the first time we met? Playground in front of the high school. You just broke up with what's her name. And we were on the swing sets and I asked you, aren't you a little too old to do that, and then you said, what'd you say, Jake? Hmm. Mm, just like that beach. Do you remember our beach, Jake? Thailand, white sand, blue, blue water. And naked Thai chicks. And then what, Jake? Then we take off our clothes and dive into the water. Yes, and then we come up as clear and pure as the day we were born. ♪ Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh ♪ ♪ Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh ♪ ♪ Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh ♪ ♪ Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh ♪ ♪ Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh ♪ What is it?

Attention shoppers, no wait in aisle four, express lane, 10 items or less, ATM or cash only. No waiting. And some of 'em could already be here, waiting, watching, waiting for us to let our guard down, hit us when our weakest. Well, I guess we'll just have to stay on our toes then, Gail. That's what my Kenny always said. On your toes. So, trust me when I say, big green heads, carrot-stick bodies, glowing fingers, it don't really matter, they're here, and we're just gonna have to deal with it. Oh boy. You ever see a chupacabra, goat sucker? You've been breakin' the rules, Lawrence, breakin' 'em pretty bad from the looks of it. You seen a woman at, three, three women? Just like a man, tie one on, go lookin' for three women. Hey, there's an Elvis update in here, Lawrence. Nah, it's Gabriel, it's Jake, it's Jake Gabriel. Jake? Jake? Oh, that's a good name. Gonna take a little gettin' used to after callin' you Lawrence. You gonna change it again soon? I'm a, I'm a soldier, I'm a man. Yeah, man havin' a hard day. Yes, it's gonna get worse. Why? You seen the Men in Black? Oh, when you're finished with that, there's a lot more where it came from. This wood, I gotta, gotta work 'cause I gotta keep workin' at bein' a good worker. Good, good. You know, every time I get close to feelin' what you're feelin' right now, I think about a story my Kenny used to tell. This old Cherokee grandfather was talkin' to his grandson about the battle that rages inside of people. He said there's two wolves inside each of us. One wolf is a bad wolf, the evil wolf. He's got rage and anger and hatred and jealousy and inferiority, superiority, and false pride, and the other wolf is good, love and caring, peace, serenity, compassion, faith, and they're fightin' this battle to the end, and the little boy thought about it for a minute and he said, but grandpa, which wolf wins? And the old Cherokee said, well, it's the one you feed. It's the one you feed. He was here. Ford's coming. They want us dead. We have to protect our own. Once we leave, find our place, they will never find us. We fight now, we finish it. We have followed you on this chase long enough. He is not fit to be one of us. He is almost ready. I'm beginning to think you're getting your old bond back with him, a human need. Revenge is the human need. I am not letting him get in the way of our survival. Our survival is about our strength, not about their demise. Our future is in his hands, not theirs, not yours. I will find Jake, wait for me in the woods. Stay focused, okay? You'll do what you have to when you find him? That perhaps no human power could have relieved our alcoholism, that God.. Could and would if he were sought. Well, I'm sure all of you are aware that I'm not super into this support group thing, but any chance to get out of the house is cool. Um, what's even cooler is our next AA birthday, which of course, is Bonna, who has 46 years this month. Yay, Bonna, yay, happy birthday. Happy birthday, Bonna. Thank you. Okay, we ready to go? It's hard to believe that it's been 46 years since I have had that last, you know, drink and that you guys were at that time just a gleam in your father's eyes and that I've been lucky enough to hang in here and see you guys make, you know, see how screwed up you can be. You understand about screwed up, Leo? I didn't have a drink! Excuse me. Are you okay? Yeah, I just, I'm looking for somebody. So, here we are stopped at this stoplight, and we're tight as sticks, and what's parked in front of us but this big truck with all these chickens in a bunch of cages with wooden, and we decide that we're gonna get them out, we give them their freedom. The poor things are stuck in there. Everybody's starin' outta the window and we're breakin' these things and the chickens are flying all over the street. Well, what happened is that we get them, we get.. Well, at least I didn't burst into flames. Rounds? Two dozen, maybe. Yeah, same here, maybe less. I thought I saw you get one of them? I did, but I barely got her limpin'. These girls are fast. What the hell's goin' on here? Folks, please, get down beneath the windows in the far back. My question you still haven't answered here, who are you people? Sir, you need to get below the windows now. Leo, sit the hell down. I'm calling the sherif on the phone. Is that guy drunk? No, he's stupid. Does anybody here know Jake Gabriel? If you mean the former Lawrence Talbot, yeah, I know Jake Gabriel. You're the second people to ask about him today. Yeah, well, we won't be the last. If you see him and he's changed, don't hesitate. Where is Sheriff Harris? He's with Great Grandpa Harris, unfortunately. What are you doin' to my car? General Ford, would you have this battle out here or there? Whichever direction you want the causality status to go. I knew there had to be drugs involved. That is not drugs. Not the shit I used to smoke, that's for sure. Hey, they're some damn military experiment, aren't they? You guys are always screwin' around tryin' to think up some perfect fighting machine, but like usual, all you've done is corrupt the human species, created some military monster, it's all your fault. What happened? He was a little to the left, so I gave him a right. We're gonna make the break. You cover the street, 12 to six, I'll cover from six to 12. And we'll take it outside on the street runnin'. It's gonna get messy. Wait, are you sure you just saw two out there? Yeah. Okay, good. I just thought for a moment we might be in trouble. It's gettin' harder to aim with these things. Sarge! Hoo-ah! Tactics, General, flanking the enemy is one of the most basic. Do you know karate, Baby? Because your body be kickin'. You know how many soldiers I saw like you over there laying on the ground, looking up at me like I was their last hope. But you're not lookin' at me like that now, are you? You wanna make out? How do you do it? How do you have a sense of humor through all this pain? I had a two year old. Fell and hit his knee once, laughing, not crying, laughing. Do you think that he would recognize me now? Do you think that anybody would recognize me now? Leo, get up now. What happened? Get up. Did you hit me? No, but I thought of it. Get up, go! Who are they? What did I tell ya? They're aliens. Aliens? Aliens. What do you say, woman? America needs us. Let's do it. Hey! Let the jarheads go. You need to pack up your weird selves and leave our town right now. Looks like we got ourselves a little militia formin' here. Insubordination will not be tolerated. You are looking at the newest, baddest unit on the block. Hey! There was a farmer who had a dog. ♪ And Bingo was his name-o ♪ Kick ass time. Let go, I have to find my family. Let go of your family. Bitch. I'll take good care of Erika for ya. Forgot how much that hurts. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Sudden death. Your funeral. Yuck. Are you the Men in Black? Those pussies, pfft. You're gonna need a doctor real quick. General, I need a drink. Just kidding. Hey, woman like that could teach ya a lot about yourself. You remember that climber who went to the top of Everest, almost no oxygen, no food. He came within inches of dying. Someone asked him why he climbed up there to die. You know what he said? Yeah. He said, I didn't. I climbed up there to live. Hey General, you ever think about retiring, goin' home to family, leavin' this to someone younger and dumber? I couldn't find anybody dumber. Yeah, but I should, I should. Yeah, you should. I should. Hey, who's your five top bands of the '70s?
