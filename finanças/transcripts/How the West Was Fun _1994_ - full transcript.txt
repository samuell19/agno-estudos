Captioning made possible by Warner Bros. The time has come. Time to find out what you're really made of, 'cause this town ain't big enough for the 3 of US. So draw. Draw...unless you're yeller. We're not yeller. Then draw. We never draw first. You draw first. No, you draw first. No, you. No, you. No, you. Both: You! You. No, you. You! You. You! You. You! You! Both: You! [Rings] All right, up and at 'em, ladies. Rise and shine. I gotta see the dragon lady. Did you have a weird dream? About the wild west? Yeah, we were in a showdown. A shoot out. Son of a gun. You know, maybe we shouldn't eat cheese right before we go to bed. Woman: Why did you approve this claim? Uh, the woman is blind. That's why. A burglar stole everything she had, including her guide dog. It's a straightforward claim. She did not install the approved deadbolt locks. That invalidates her insurance policy. I've canceled her claim. The woman is blind. She lost her dog. That's her problem. Our problem is making sure we don't pay out more than we need to. Get that through your head! Did you hear that? She's stiffing a blind woman. She lost her-- oh. Thank you for your support. Humanitarians one and all. Father: Ok, we're home. Here, I'll get that, wait. Thanks, sweetie. Milk, milk, milk. Son of a gun, I forgot the milk. Hey, this is strange. There's a letter here addressed to your mom. What is it? Um... The letter says that the dude ranch where your mom used to stay as a kid is in trouble and asking US to come right away. Really? Yeah. "Do not call. Just come before it's too late." Huh. Yeah, it's addressed to your mother. That's funny, I wrote-- I wrote natty about Sara. Who wrote that letter? That's the strange part. It's not signed. Well, "before it's too late"? That sounds serious. She loved the place and her godmother natty. And she had her own horse, and he was called lightning. That's right. It sounds like natty needs help. We better go right away. Well, guys, we just can't go like that. Why not? We have spring break. And you have lots of vacation time. And you never take it. That's true. And it would be great if you 2 could finally meet natty. And maybe we could be some help. But guys, the dragon lady, she won't let me go. If the dragon lady gives you time off work, could we go? Sure. But believe me, that won't happen. Look, I gotta go downstairs and get some milk. You guys get started on your homework. What do you think? We have to go. Yeah, but how? Let's call the dragon lady. Maybe if we explain it to her, she'll understand. Great idea. Get dad's business card. [Dialing] [Telephone rings] Man: Fairgate insurance. May I speak to the dragon la-- shh! Mrs. Plaskett, please? Man: Sorry, she's busy. Oh, well, could you give her a message? Man: Yes. Tell her that Mr. Martin needs to take his vacation starting tomorrow. [Man laughs] Thank you. Bye. I don't know who that was, but he was laughing. Let's start packing. [Telephone rings] [Rings] [Answering machine beeps] Stephen, this is Mrs. Plaskett. I understand you want to take your vacation starting tomorrow. Go ahead. In fact, make that a permanent vacation. You're fired. Uh-oh. Hey. Everything ok? Well, we sort of called Mrs. Plaskett and left her a message. No. You didn't. You did? It was about your vacation. What? Yeah, and she called back. What? [Tape rewinds] Stephen, this is Mrs. Plaskett. I understand you want to take your vacation starting tomorrow. Go ahead. See? It's ok with her. That's terrific. Girls, that's fantastic. You girls are terrific, really. What's going to happen when he finds out? Why depress yourself? It's too late now.

Rafter 6. Susie: Wow, look at this place. Jessica: What's that smell? I think it's fresh air. What a concept. Look! What is she doing, daddy? She's a trick rider. Wow. Wow, look at her go. All right! Ha ha! Whoo! Terrific. I was concentrating. I didn't see anybody was watching. That was great the way you galloped upside down. You know, if you wore your seatbelt, that probably wouldn't happen. Daddy. Who are you? We're, um, uh, just visiting. I'm Stephen. I'm Jessica. I'm susie. Are you with the rodeo? Yeah. I practice here. I'm Laura forester. Can we pet your horse? Sure. His name's Hercules. Oh, see? We already have something in common. My father's name was Hercules. Daddy. Well, it was his nickname. Play with the horse. Well, you're just a real city slicker, aren't you? Yeah, I saw Maverick twice. I guess that's not enough to call me a real cowboy. You're off to a good start. You're standing in horse manure. I, uh-- I thought it was kind of an authentic thing to do. I'm glad you got here in time. Time? Time for what? Dinner. First I'll show you your cabin. Stephen: Thanks. Excuse me, are you an Indian? You're supposed to say native American. Yes, I am. Is your name sleeping owl or running elk or something like that? Is your name susie or Jessica or something like that? Yeah. Uh-huh. They call me George tailfeathers. George, I can't get over this place. This is really the west. It's so... Western. Oh, I used to love to go to western movies when I was a kid. We'd play cowboys and indi-- uh, cowboys and Germans. So, George... When can we see natty? You'll see her at dinner, and her son Bart. We didn't know about him. Many don't. Hyah! [Brays] Dad, what's the red fat thing in the kitchen? Um, that is a wood burning stove. It was used by the pioneers. I guess that was before they had microwaves. Daddy, I've just noticed something. No TV? Guys, um, people knew how to amuse themselves long before there was TV. You're kidding. You know what they did? Watched videos. No, they talked to each other. This could be a long vacation. Natty? I think there's some people here you wanted to see. Oh, my. It is just like seeing little Sara again, only double. Oh. Mmm... But here I am hugging you, and you don't even know who I am. Sure we do. You're natty, I'm susie, this is Jessica, and that's our dad. Stephen. And this is my boy Bart. Where's your mom? Oh, natty. Um... I--i wrote you when it happened. Um... Sara died 3 years ago. Oh, no. You obviously never got my letter. Oh, you know the mail these days, especially rural. It's very unreliable. Oh, you poor young 'uns. I can't believe she's gone. I wanted Sara and her family to see it before-- I'm so sorry. But I'm really glad you're here. Bart, isn't it wonderful? Yeah, yeah, it's fabulous. If this is a dude ranch, where are all the dudes? Oh, honey, there was a time when this place was full of paying guests. We had hay rides and barbecues, and we even had a rodeo every year. But we haven't had one in a long time. Bart: Well, you know, nobody comes anymore. They all want to go to these theme parks and fantasy rides. That's why we're selling the place. You're selling it? Mm-hmm. Oh, this place is deep in debt and back taxes, too. So, I was lucky enough to find a buyer. But if we don't sign the place over to him in 10 days, he's gonna back out of the deal. Who's buying the ranch? A very wealthy person. What's his name? Aren't they cute? Mama, why don't you sign the deed right now, and that way you can visit with these delightful urchins all you want. Not now. Not the first night that Sara's girls arrived. We've got too much to talk about. Well, it was just a thought. Daddy? Huh? Are you still glad we came? Uh-huh. Your mom would've been glad, too. Whew. I knew they had nature out west, but I never knew they had so much of it. [Whinny] Be careful. Don't worry. It's just an old horse. 25 years old. 25! We call him lightning. Lightning. Lightning. [Whinny] Where's he going? Never can tell. But I think he wants you to follow him. [Whinny] [Whinny] Where are we going? I can't tell. Come on. It's too far. I'll ruin my dress. I told you to wear jeans. It's not my look. Just come on. Lightning, wait up! [Whinny] [Whinny] What's that? "Sara's lair." Let's go in. We'd better not. George: I thought you might like it. This was your mother's secret place. You knew her? Very well. Go inside. Come with US, George. Where'd he go? Strange. Strange. Mommy played here when she was our age. Look. I wonder what's in those. There you go... Uh...Unh... Down. Come on. Here. Half of an owl. Half of a bear. "Read this and die." Mommy's diary. Should we read it? She meant grownups shouldn't read it. "This is my third summer on the ranch "with natty and lakey, and Bart, who is still a fink." What's a fink? I don't know, but it sounds right. "He spends most of his time in the cellar workshop." "I got in through the secret of the bear's mouth." Bear's mouth! Bear's mouth! "I'm trying to like Bart "because natty loves him so much, "but it's hard to like Bart gifooley. "Yesterday I saw Bart in the woods "setting a fire to some bushes. He got lost in the smoke, but I got him out." "I can't tell natty he did it because it would break her heart." "Natty and I still plan one day "to find the lost gold mine, "but nearly losing the ranch had made me think "about why it's so special. "Here the sky is wide open and the birds fly free. "The animals here are trusting and gentle. "They seem to know who you are "and want to be your friend. "The water in the river is so clean and fresh "you can see the pebbles on the bottom "sparkling like diamonds when the sunlight hits them. "And the horses are like magic spirits. "They run and play, and when I watch them, "I'm so happy to be alive. "It must always be kept this way for natty, and everyone who loves the world." That'd be terrible, losing the ranch. Oh, no! Another fire! I wonder if it's Bart again. What are you burning? I was just getting rid of some things before the sale. That's mostly paper. Couldn't you recycle it? Ha! Why don't you kids go someplace and play, huh? Fire is very dangerous. You could fall in. Oh, no! A burning piece of paper got carried away by the wind! Where? Where? Over there. It looks like it landed on the roof. Hurry! Oh, no. And I canceled the insurance. "Dear Mr. Gifooley: We are sorry to hear "that the ranch is closing. "We wanted to bring "our whole family back this time. Yours truly, Rose fermez." "Dear Mr. Gifooley: "Sorry that you have canceled our reservations." Oh, I don't need this. I don't need this at all! Well, what's the date on yours? Almost a year ago. Yours? 6 months ago. Bart said nobody wanted to come anymore. But really he's been turning them away. That's why he's selling the ranch. [Panting] Ok! What do you have? Nothing. Give it to me! Give me... Oh, you little creeps! Oh...come on, come on... Come to papa. Come to papa. Come on. Come to papa. Oh...come on. Hey! Here...Here... Drop down. Drop down, drop down. Man... Oh. Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes--oh! Yeah! Yes! Yes! Got you! Out of my way. [Panting] Ow! Mm-hmm... Aah! Whoa! Whoa! Uh... Oh... What should we do with this letter? We have to show this to natty. I don't think so. You tell your dad you want to go back to the city right... Now. We can't. Oh, yeah? Why not? He got fire-- don't! Heh heh heh heh! Let me tell you something. This ranch ain't big enough for the 3 of US. The dream! The dream! What? We're staying. And we're gonna help save the ranch. Then this is war. Time for your riding lessons. Yeah! Yes! Bart: Hey, you stick around... Hey, I'll give you a little lesson, too. Take a bath. George: Ok, now you're starting to look good. Now, keep your heels down. And keep your hand in front of the horn. That's right, that's right. But lift it up a bit, lift it up a bit. That's good. Yeah. Now, remember, we're not ready for any runaways yet, ok? [Chuckles] I think that horse likes you. Remember what I said: Heels down. Be part of the horse. You're not driving, you're riding! George, we have to tell natty about Bart... And the letter. Ah, natty is smart, except for one thing: Bart. She's convinced he's just as kind and decent as she is. You mean even if we told her that Bart's a fink, she wouldn't believe US? You have to have evidence. [Clanging] Lunch time! Come and get it! I'm so glad there's some life around this place again. I feel like kicking up my heels. Well, just be careful you don't kick the bucket. Oh, Bart... I think you look great. You know, mama, these little nippers have quite a good imagination. They haven't been... Telling you any stories, have they? No. Good. You girls are very bright. Well, they certainly are. I'm glad that you three are getting along so well. Natty, could you tell US how you started the ranch? Well, it was a dream for my late husband and me. Did you have a lot of money? We didn't have 2 dimes to rub together, but we got a loan and then we worked hard, and before we knew it, the place was attracting guests. We had presidents here, and kings, and a whole lot of really nice ordinary folks. Wow! Maybe you could get another loan and start over again... And get this place back on its feet. That's a good idea. A good idea! A good idea? Mama, these are kids you're talking to. They're in kindergarten. We are not. We're in second grade. In the advanced reading group. Oh, I'm really impressed. Mama... Hey, I've done everything I can to bring this thing back on its feet. Come on, girls, we've got to do an inventory on the things we need. You know the old saying. Rome was built in a day. Now, we've got to get a loan, mama... And we've got to get the word out. Mama... We have one thing to do... The expression is "Rome wasn't built in a day." Your dad's a businessman. Do you think he'll help? Twins: We're sure he will! This is madness! Or senility. More beans? Assassin! Where's dad? With Laura. Doing what? Learning to ride. He's probably galloping by now. I hope he's not going too fast. Are you two gonna spend all your time jawing, or are you gonna help an old lady shovel out the stables? What are we shoveling? Horse manure. Huh? Horse poo-poo. I prefer horse manure. You have to shovel it? Wow! Now, this isn't just food. This is grub. Well, this is the west, where the men are men, and so are the women. Not from where I'm sitting. You move fast, don't you? No. No, I don't. I talk fast, and I move slow. In fact, since Sara died, I haven't done much moving at all in the romance department. You still miss her? Yeah. I mean, she would've wanted me to get on with my life. Are you? Um...yeah. Ah, I haven't really accomplished anything. You've done a great job raising those little girls. They're sweethearts. Thanks. But actually, they've been raising me. I kept thinking that one day I'd wake up and feel all grown up... But it never happened. When did you start feeling grown up? Stephen, you're talking to a woman who spends her life traveling with a rodeo doing trick riding. Truth is, I haven't grew up either. Really? Mm-hmm. Well, I mean you-- you must've had... Lots of men in your life. Well, a--a few. A few. You're a funny man. Thanks. You do mean intentionally, don't you? Funny. But insecure. I am? Yes... Well, penny earned... Well... Natty: I don't know. It's probably one of Sara's secrets. Did you and mom ever find a gold mine on the ranch? Oh. Ha ha. One summer, we looked and looked, but we didn't find it. I did find some wonderful artifacts for my museum, though. Have you been there yet? No, but we're going. Natty, did you and mom ever save the ranch from fire one day? She told you about that? I hope we can help you save the ranch. You two are just like her. If we're gonna save the ranch, it's gonna take a lot of hard work. Because I'm not the miracle worker I used to be. Natty, we have to tell you something about Bart. Oh, don't mind him. He's not used to kids. It's not that. I reckon nearly getting killed in that fire really upset him. Ever since then, he's been, well, moody. Moody? Moody? Girls, even if your family doesn't turn out just the way you hope, you gotta stick by them. Deep down, Bart is a good soul. Yes, hello, Mrs., uh, plaskett. Yeah, this is Bart gifooley. Yeah, what can I do for you, Bart? Well, I need to ask you a question about an employee that used to work there-- Mr. Stephen Martin. Fire him if you hired him, and if he's looking for work, don't. Well, thank you very much. You have been, uh, more than helpful. So, that's what we think we should do. Girls, I think it's a terrific idea, but it's a long drive back to Philly. Dad, it's what mom would want US to do. Yeah. Uh, why don't we sit down? Look... We have to leave before the 9 days are up. I have to get back to my job. Bart: What job is this? Oh, I'm sorry. Did you want to tell him? Tell me what? Dad, we didn't tell you-- your boss-- Mrs. Plaskett-- she fired you. What? When? When you didn't play all of her phone message. You--you didn't do that? Ha ha ha ha. Kids do the darndest things. Ha ha ha ha ha. Uh, natty, I think we're gonna be available a little longer. You two and I are gonna have a long, long talk. You know, um, I hate to rain on this parade, but the banks, they don't look too kindly on the... Unemployed. Natty: Tell you what, you're my new manager. I'm your new manager? Mom, have you lost your marbles? Hush. Ok, then, you're my new marketing director. Natty, I appreciate it, but it's-- mom, this is ridiculous. Now, just sign this before it's too late. Hey, it's not ridiculous. Uh...um... We can make up a flier, and fax it to the personnel officers of the top... 500 corporations. Ha ha ha ha. Yes! Yes! Maybe somebody will want to send US a business group. And maybe you and Laura could help with the loan application, too. Yeah, maybe the little duplicates could cosign for you. Not a bad idea. Look, we have a week before the tax man comes and you end up in the poorhouse. Sounds like you don't want to save the ranch, Bart. I don't think he does. Me, neither. Rrr. [Barking] Stephen: I'd work for nothing, and I'd invest our nest egg in buying equipment for the ranch. George and Laura will give riding lessons for free. You thought this all through very well. I need to take this up with my boss, but I'm going to recommend that we approve the loan. He usually takes my recommendations. That sounds great. Thanks, Mr. Sutton. How long will it take before we get formal approval? Oh, unfortunately, Mr. Bellamy is, uh, out of town, so it'll take about a week. We don't have much time. Do you think it would be safe to start spending my own money to get started? Strike while the iron is hot. Yes! Yes! Stephen: We got all the supplies, natty. Now what am I gonna do with them? Wait a second, a fax is coming in. Listen to this. "Received your fax. Sudden change in plan "means we require dude ranch, weekend, "for 25 executives. "No need to confirm. "We will arrive at 10 A.M. "On Saturday next. "Signed, e.J. Peabody, personnel manager of international general industries." Yahoo! Oh. 25 execs, that's fantastic. What do I do? What do we do? Stephen. Is he always this nervous? Dad, chill. Chill, chill, chill, chill. [Telephone rings] Hello. Rafter 6 guest ranch. How may I direct your call? Yeah, this is Sammy at the hardware store. Oh, hey, Sammy. How you doing? Well, listen, I phoned the bank and they wouldn't approve your loan. What? They said no way. W-W-What? [Tires screeching] Excuse me. No! No, you can't! Wait, you--no! Excuse me. I have spent all my money on supplies. I have run up a huge bill of credit for more stuff. Suddenly, the guy at the hardware store tells me that he called here for a credit check and there's no loan. I meant to call you. I faxed your application to my boss and he turned it down. Why? He felt your business plan was unrealistic. Oh, the heck it is! We already have 25 guests lined up. You do? Already? Yes. Look at the fax. Just think if they like it and recommend it-- lurlene, would you get a Mr. Peabody of international energy industries general on the phone for me? I'm not saying we're wrong, but, uh, if this is true, I'd be impressed. Look, Mr. Sutton... We need this loan. I have 2 dozen horses coming, saddles, rafts, and food. I--i have spent every penny of my own money. Natty is counting on this, so are my girls. Frankly, so am I. [Intercom buzzes] Yes, lurlene? Lurlene: No go. Say what? Well, there's no Mr. Peabody. There's no Mr. Peabody at international energy industries general, and nobody knows anything about this. But that's impossible. Thank you, lurlene. I think your little scheme just backfired. Good day. It wasn't a trick. Mr. Sutton-- good day. Mr. Peabody, I presume. General peabody. Ha ha ha ha ha. Boy, is natty's museum a cool place. All kinds of animals and Indian stuff. Do you think dad really likes Laura? Head over heels. Look at the blackfoot dancer. Ooh, a real teepee. Jessica, Jessica! What's wrong? Remember mom's diary? Bear! Bear! Ow! What? What? There's a button, I think. It's a switch. [Bear growls] Aah! Aah! It's a staircase, or this bear has a really big mouth. It's Bart's workshop. It would be naughty to. It would be wrong. Both: Let's go for it. [Toy laughing] [Whistle toots] Wow! This is awesome! So is a snake before it bites. Yeah, you're right. I'd rather see horses run free, on real grass. It's cute, but phony. [Bear growls] Somebody's coming! Hello, my baby. Have you been a good little masterpiece while daddy's been away, hmm? Ha ha ha ha ha. Oh, boy. When this baby gets built... The world is going to forget about every other theme park. Ha ha ha ha. Every kid on earth is gonna wanna come to... Gifooley land. ♪ Gifooley land ♪ Ow! Ow-- "why?" you may ask. Well, it's because you, Bart, are a visionary. You can read it in your palms. You can feel it in your blood. [Train whistle toots] And with money from mcrugger enterprises, I can pave over this whole stupid ranch in about 2 weeks time. And then, a year later, gifooley land will be the greatest theme and ride park in the universe. Natty: Bart, are you down there? What? Oh, yes, mama. It's ok, it's clear. That's it. No hope. But, dad, don't you see? Bart must have sent that fax to fool US. Yes, mother? Jessica, I know you're disappointed, but there's nothing to be gained by trying to blame Bart. That's right. Boy, the very idea of trying to turn a mother against her only son-- here you go, mama, sign right here. Natty, please don't. Uh, please, do. I don't know whatever gave me the idea that I could get this ranch going again. Give me the deed. Don't, natty. Come with US first. Come with US, please? Well, where? Where are you taking me? Mama. We're wasting time. Is that what you've been building? A man's got to have a hobby. Well, I reckon I owe Bart an apology for doubting him. You owe him one, too. Yeah, I reckon you do. We're sorry. We're sorry. It's all right. Nothing's forgiven. Mama, why don't you go back up to your room? I think there's something you wanted to do, like sign the deed. I guess it's time. Let's get it over with. I heard you sneaking around in here, you little creeps, and you know, your mother used to sneak around in here, too. I'm not as dumb as I look. You couldn't be. Hey, if I'm so dumb, how come I won? Hmm. Heh heh. What are you gonna do now? Find another job. Move far enough away that I don't have to watch Bart spoil the land. It's not fair. Yeah, right. You know, before the white man came to this country, the Indians didn't have any concept of owning land. You just lived off the land. You hunted, you fished, you grew crops, and then you thanked the land for what it gave you. The land's for everybody, people and animals, too. The land's a living thing. No one can own a living thing. I wish Indians still ran things. You and me. What would you do with the land? Start a casino. Huh? Huh? Just kidding. Just kidding. We can't let Bart ruin the land. What are we going to do? Natty will sign any minute. Where could Bart have that model of gifooley land? He said he was going to relax. Hot tub! Is that where he goes? Into the hot tub. Sometimes he stays there till he's wrinkled as a prune. Not a pretty sight. Ahh, ladies and gentlemen, the founder of gifooley land... Mr. Bart gifooley! Thank you! Thank you! Ooh, these bucking broncos aren't going to work. I hear the voice of a female fan. Oh, hello. What's on your mind? [High-pitched voice] Oh, Bart, you're such a genius. I just love you. [Normal voice] I know. So many women feel that way. It's the mind and the body. Wouldn't you be more comfortable here in the jacuzzi with me? Ready? Ready. I'll blind my eyes. 1, 2, 3-- I'm peeking-- 4-- hey! Hey! What are you doing?! Hey, you get your paws off my model! Hey, you kids! Come on, hurry! He's coming! Come back with that! Dang it! That is private property, young ladies. You put it down this instant! What is that? A model. Just like we told you. Gifooley land? He's going to pave over the land and build this stupid thing. But you're not going to let that happen, are you, natty? Too late. It's too late. She signed. She signed! You mean it's true? Yes, mama. Mama, right now, this ranch is a hundred acres of nothing. But with money from mcrugger enterprises, we can pave it over, and transform this place into the most fantastic western theme park you've ever seen. Why, we'll have rides and games and videos and neon. And it'll all bear my name, mama. I have a dream. But what about the ranch, the trees and flowers and the animals? I hate the trees and the flowers and the animals. I always have. Mama, that was you and Sara, that was you and dad, that was you and George, that was you and the ranch. You never had enough time for me. Is that why you tried to burn down the ranch? Yes-- how'd you know about that? I thought I knew you. You know diddly. You're going to the old folks home, mama. George, you're fired. The 3 of you, I want you off my property by morning, and as for that-- that horse that you're so crazy about-- what is his name: Lightning? Natty: Bart-- he's going to-- I'm sorry, mama, he's going to the glue factory. All these years, I didn't see the truth because I didn't want to. You're just plain rotten. Well, you heard it. Verbal abuse. Maybe you'd prefer a little physical abuse? No, no! No! I am nonviolent. Stephen, let him go. He's not worth it. Hit it, cookie! Hit what? Cookie, can't you do anything right? Bart: That's better! Yes! What do you think you're doing? Give me that! You are tampering with private property, young lady. You could be severely punished! It might be worth it. How's natty? Is there any way we could stop gifooley land from happening? Bart has Leo mcrugger backing him. We don't stand a chance. And even if we did, there's still the back taxes to pay. Who's Leo mcrugger? A real tough businessman in Denver. He'd sell his grandmother for a buck. His grandmother? It's a figure of speech. Let's just say he's a lot like Bart. Let Bart think what he wants about the deed. We still have work to do. Now, the only person who can help US now is Leo mcrugger. How far is Denver? I don't know, but a girl's got to do what a girl's got to do. Don't fall asleep at the reins. Woman: Look at that! Man: Check it out! Is there a parade? Hey, Rick, look at that. Woman: Where on earth are their parents? Look at those two. They're so adorable. Man: Ha ha. Hey, kids, where you headed? You see seventh street? Do you know how to get to seventh street? It's right over there, silly. [Train whistle blows] Let's park out in front. Hey, look at the kids. Uh, excuse me? Can I help you? Girls? We're here to see Mr. Mcrugger. Both: Who is the responsible adult? Both: We give up, who? Mr. Mcrugger is having a breakfast meeting with his executive board. Is he expecting you? Not exactly, but it's urgent. He's too busy... Too see you. We'll... Wait. Man: Coffee for the meeting. Thanks, Arnold. Go right in. Do you girls-- Phil, stay with me on this. It isn't calculus. We're gonna have a p.R. Crisis if the media got ahold of that story, and see that they don't or you're out of here. Yes, sir. What's next on the agenda? Gifooley land. Who said that? We did. Who are you? We're the committee to save rafter 6. How come you want to build gifooley land? Ha ha ha ha ha. How come? Ha ha ha. Because it's going to make me a lot of money, that's how come. It's for kids. You're kids. You'll love it. No, we won't. You won't? It'll be plastic. And fake. Yeah? There'll be robot animals instead of real animals. Yeah? And there'll be cement instead of dirt. And everybody will be smiling all the time and wearing fake cowboy outfits. So, the point? The west isn't cement and neon. It's where the sky's wide open and the birds fly free. And the animals are trusting and gentle. And the water's so clean and fresh, you could see the pebbles sparkling like diamonds. And it's horse manure, and even that's ok because it's real. The point is that a theme park in a good location can make US a mint. And what's all this got to do with you two? I'm buying the ranch from what's-his-name? Woman: Bart gifooley. Bart "the fink" gifooley. Have I met him? No, sir. We spared you that. We heard that you and he are alike. You'd both sell your grandmothers-- for a buck. Woman: What? [Giggling] [Everyone laughing] [Laughter stops] My god... You're not scared of me. That's refreshing. We're friends of Bart's mom natty, and she owns the dude ranch. And she made money without paving over anything. We'd like to invite you and your friends to the ranch this weekend, and experience... How the west was fun. Oh, i'm a very busy man. That's too bad. We overheard that you're having p. R. Trouble. If we took this story to the media... Tough businessman turns down plea from 2 cute little girls. Roger! Uh, well, if we could make a profit without investing the millions it would take to build gifooley land, it might-- might be viable. How much is this weekend going to cost me? It's free. Free? Done. Folks, we're going to a dude ranch for the weekend. Yes! Yes! But if you two don't prove your case, it's gifooley land. And I don't want any further trouble from you. Deal? Hmm? Deal. Deal. Well, good. Now, how did you get here? The horse we rode in on. Well, take the train, or you won't get home. I'm gonna call the sheriff. They're probably out riding somewhere for the last time. I mean, before they leave. They just don't go off. They know better than that. I bet they're perfectly fine. I wouldn't be surprised if they're looking for some job for you around here. I could go for that. Oh, well, you're not cut out to be a cowpoke anyway. Hey, I can round up doggies with the best of 'em. You don't even know what a doggie is. Ah, if you want to get all hung up on details... Ha ha ha ha. I guess you moving to the city would be out of the question? What question? [Horse whinnies] Oh, there they are. I called you all in to give you some good news. Mr. Gifooley here has a plan to bring a wonderful tourist attraction to our area. All the business will go through our bank. Great! All right! Girls, that's great, although you shouldn't have gone off by yourselves that way. It's too late. Natty already signed the deed. Yeah. There's nothing we can do. Actually... [Whimpers] Laura: That's the original deed. Yep, someday, you will be able to tell your children that you were there at the official start of gifooley land, the day that I finally got control of the ranch, as attested to in this deed of sale, an historic document. What? Ha ha ha ha. Stephen: But how? When? When he was putting the flag back up. I made the switch. Great! Oh, yeah! Ha ha ha! Laura: Good work, girls. But I still don't have enough money for the rest of the supplies we need. If I had any, I'd put it in, but I'm tapped. Laura: I do. Well, not money, really, but I have something I can put up for collateral. What? Hercules. Oh, no. No, no. Not only do you love that horse, he's your way of making a living. I can't ask you to risk losing him. You didn't ask, I offered. Besides, if Mr. Mcrugger breaks his deal with Bart and goes in with natty, then everything works out. And, after all, we're all in this together. Thanks, Laura. But dad, susie, and me, we'll figure out something. We're a team. You don't want me on the team? Stephen: Uh-huh. I think I know what this is all about. The girls are still very attached to the memory of Sara. Girls, Laura and I are just friends. You're always laughing and teasing each other. We've seen movies. We know where that leads. Ok, I won't do it for you or for Stephen. I'll do it to save the ranch. I don't want to see it spoiled. After this weekend, I'll be joining the rodeo again. Stephen: Laura... We didn't mean to hurt her feelings. Maybe not... But you did. Giddyap! All right, where is it? Lose something, Bart? You know what I'm talking about. I want the deed that natty signed. I don't remember signing any deed. You were all here. Did I sign? All: No. Bart, I want you off my land and out of my sight right now. If you come back, I'm going to do what I should have done 35 years ago. I'm going to turn you over my knee and give you a good spanking. Hah. Like you're big enough. I am. Look, I got no problem with you. Mom, you know that rest home? I put you down for the deluxe suite. Well, you can just forget it. You're not only not getting cable, you're getting no TV. And I will be back. Drive careful, bartie. [Everyone cheering] Let's get to work. Crazy paleface. Laura, we wanted to-- you know, girls, I'm not the settling down type, anyway. And certainly not with a city slicker like your dad. So...come on. Let's get to work. Yeah! Welcome! Welcome! Both: Hi, Mr. Mcrugger. Hi, kids. Hi. Welcome to rafter 6. Uh-huh. Or gifooley land, depending on how this goes. Sir, this will be a weekend that you and your colleagues will never forget. I'm sure we will. I'm going to make sure it's a weekend that greenhorn and his friends will never forget. What should I cook? Oh... Ha ha! Who knows how to ride? All: Not me. No problem. George and Laura are excellent teachers. If you all follow me, you can each pick a horse. Where are the horses? Oh, they're right over-- where are the horses? They were there a half an hour ago. Well? I'll be with you in a second. Keep them busy for a minute. Hi, girls. So, Mr. Mcrugger, how did you get started? Yeah, how did you get to be so successful? Oh, I'm a self-made man. Is that right? When I was just your age, I read treasure island, and I decided I was going to find that treasure. No kidding? Of course, that was just a fantasy. Then when I got older, I decided if I couldn't find my fortune, I was going to make it in business. Yeah. Heh heh. I started following the stock market when I was only 14 years old. Bart must have driven them off. It's gonna take hours to round them up. What are we gonna do? They could ride Hercules, one at a time. They're not anywhere. George, what are we gonna do? You stall them. I'll go see my friends, see if they got any horses they can spare. I'm gonna need a hand. I'll come with you. Stall them. Ok, now, we've covered the names of the parts of the horse-- the head, the neck, the back, and the buttocks. And the parts of the cowperson-- the head, the neck, the back... And the buttocks. Uh, now, uh, let's look at some of the rules of the road--uh, t-trail. If 2 riders come to an intersection at the same time, which rider has the right-of-way? Oh, come on, now, I want to see a show of hands. The one on the right? Ah, yes. That's very good, Leona. Now, what's the fastest you can go when riding through a school zone? Hold the phone, bucko! I didn't come up here to sit on a barrel in a stupid classroom. I want to get outside. I want some action! That's right! We're done with the theory, and it's time for practice. Well, that's more like it! Just pick out any horse you like. No. Oh, let me have it. Is this one mine? Stephen, wait. Are you kidding? They're ready to mutiny. Mount up! Stephen, there's something wrong with these horses. What? They're wild mustangs. Oh...aah! Aah! Hey! Hey, whoa! Hey! No! No! Whoa! Those horses aren't quite broken in. No kidding! I ain't going riding with you! Ok, folks. Where'd those horses come from? Bart. [Neigh] Well! Heh. Was that fun, or what? [Air escaping] We have a wonderful river running through the ranch, and this afternoon you're going to get a chance to ride down it. Rafting doesn't sound very exciting. You can make it a contest, Mr. Mcrugger. We have 2 rafts. That's more like it! Who wants to be on my team? We do! We all do! Me! Me! How did you know mcrugger would like to make it a contest? He's a control freak. First raft to the bend in the river is champion of the universe! See what I mean? Natty: Now, remember, don't stand up, keep a grip on your paddles. On your Mark... Get set... Go! Mcrugger: Stroke! Stroke! Stroke! Keep the rhythm! [All shouting at once] Roger, stroke! Stroke! Stroke! Mcrugger: The raft is sinking! [All shouting and screaming] Sometimes I don't like being a kid. We have no power. Native Americans find their power on a vision quest. What's that? After careful preparation and thought, you go into nature and wait until a spirit reveals itself to you. It could be an animal or some other form of nature. It will give you special spirit strength and understanding. And power. Do spirits come to the city? They find people in all kinds of ways. [Voice chanting] I--i know. I shouldn't be here, but i--i really missed your home cooking. You did? Yes, I did. In fact, I'm going to get a couple slices of this great bread that you bake. I didn't bake it. I bought it. I know. And nobody buys bread like you do. How about some chicken to go with it? You know, actually, I'm on a diet. Look, I'm terribly sorry about the rafts and you getting all wet. But, how about those teepees, huh? And though they're not part of the weekender special and are usually reserved for long-staying guests, in this instance, we want you to know the magic of real western living. Now, won't that be fun? Sleeping on the ground's fun? Hallowed ground, Mr. Mcrugger. Hallowed ground. And we want you to work up a big appetite. Let me take a wild guess. Dinner? [Coughing] Oww! Look, Mr. Mcrugger, I am really sorry about all the mishaps. I feel like I let everyone down. Now, I know if I had one more chance, I'm sure-- don't talk! Just serve the beans. Well, here we are around the campfire. Uh, does anybody know any good songs? I don't want to sing. I don't want to be here. I want to go home. So do I. So do I. Hey. Are you gonna let a couple of little setbacks break your spirit? It's not my spirit that's broken. It's my Fanny. A few little setbacks. If anything else goes wrong, we'll have to call in the marines. With this kind of performance, this place will never be a dude ranch. Maybe a maximum security prison. But it's Bart gifooley who made everything go wrong. I don't want to hear excuses, people. When my Van gets here in the morning, we're leaving.

Vision quest. The old way you can discover your power in your dreams. [Voice chanting] [Wings flapping] Was that all a dream? I'm not sure. Do you feel any different? You mean, like, more powerful? Yeah! [Makes air rushing sound] [Makes same sound] If we found the power, we must be able to think of something. Yeah! Even if mom never found a treasure, the ranch is the treasure. I got it. We have an idea, and if it works, we might be able to save the ranch. But we're worried that Bart will get in the way again. We think we have to do something about Bart. He's long overdue. Well... I won't stop you. But please don't hurt him... Bad. Could you track him and find him? Can a frog catch a fly? Then let's go! We need to take care of him before the others wake up. Hey, wait! You going to go tracking in your long Johns? No! No! What is it? 24-inch radials. Weather resistant. We're getting close. I hear something. It's him. How do you know? Air conditioner. [Air conditioner hums] Go gather some branches. Hey, Bart! We're calling you out, Bart gifooley! You've been messin' with the wrong people, gifooley! Oh, yeah? Well, what are you gonna do about it, small fry? You're nothin' but a bunch of losers. Come out and say that to our faces! I'd have to stand in a hole to do that. You scared to face US? That'll be the day. Look, I said it once, and I'll say it-- aah! What in the name of Pete?! What's going on here? George, get over here! I order you to cut me down immediately. I seem to remember getting fired. Excuse US. We have work to do. We'll cut you down when we're done. Well, what am I supposed to do in the meantime? I guess you'll just have to hang around. [Laughing] Aah! Just got to load these, uh... It's too bad you're leaving before the best part. Ha ha ha! What, exactly, did you have in mind? Throwing US off the top of a cliff? No. But it's ok. Please, miss all the fun. We were just gonna take these clues and locate the hidden treasure. Treasure? What are you talking about? Please, don't even ask, Mr. Mcrugger. It's an old native American legend. The lost gifooley gold mine. But never mind. What does the legend say? Somewhere on this ranch is a lost gold mine. This has the clues. Clues? Yep. Uh, do these cases go in, too? No, wait, wait, wait. W-Wait--wait a minute. So what was the plan? We were gonna give you the clues. And then we were going to ask you to help US look for the treasure. With the help of a real native American guide. Proud to be your guide. Mr. Mcrugger, please, haven't we already been subjected to enough torture and humiliation? We were gonna split the gold with whoever helps US find it. On the other hand... What's one more day? All right, we're staying. Yeah! Yes! I haven't changed my mind. At least if we can find some gold, it'll compensate for the time I've wasted here. What about the horses? I'll round up all the good ones. Promise? Scout's honor. Yee-yeah! Let's ride! Yee-hah! Hyah! [Clicks tongue] Come on! Giddyap, now! Stephen: How did you manage this? Dad, in business you have to have u.S.P. You mean e.S.P. No. U.S.P. A unique selling proposition. Something that will appeal to the customer. That's the search for the gold mine. Uh-huh. And just how long did you guys spend talking to Mr. Mcrugger yesterday? A long time. And when we get back, we'd like to take a look at your business plans. And maybe we'll have an idea or two. Cookie! Cookie! Get away from me! You know, this is all your fault. You and those brats. You're glue, you know. Cookie! Ok, nice horsie. Go get cookie. Good horsie. Go get cookie, you moron! The next clue's a split stone. Well, come on, let's hit it! Ha ha! Hey! That looks like a split stone. No, it doesn't. It looks like a man riding a bicycle. There! It's a split stone! Yahoo! Ha ha! Cookie! Cookie! There! A tunnel through a split in a stone! But which way do we go? Can we split up? No, stay together. Work our way through. You guys go ahead. I'll lead the horses around. I'll help you. We'd like you to come if you want to, Laura. It'd be nice if you were with US. I'll be here. Cookie! Cookie! Cookie! Cut me down. Down the middle? No. Just cut me down. Oh. Ok. You are a moron. No, really, cut me down! Oh, ok. You are an ugly moron. Cookie! Right behind you, girls. We're right behind you, chief. Yeah, we're right here. We're with you. Ohh! Oh, wow! We didn't find anything. Don't worry, we'll find it. Let's keep riding. Ok, cookie, let's head 'em off at the pass. Hey, cookie, come on. [Muttering] Start rowing, you idiot! Push! The other side, cookie! Have you ever been outdoors in your life? Now, come on, downriver. Row! Row! Row! Put your weight into it. That's it--the 3 old men! Right! Stephen: The 3 old men. Ha ha! Yahoo! Ha ha ha! Mcrugger: I'll look over here! We'll look over here. You girls be careful. Don't get lost. Look! Look. The owl. The bear. Look. I can't see. Close your eyes for a minute, then open them again. Gold! Gold! Mcrugger: Hey, kids! You find anything? It's over here! We found it! Yah-ha ha ha ha! Whoo-hoo! Gold! Girls, where are you? Wait for dad! Oh, quit complaining, cookie. I'm navigating, which is much harder than what you're doing. Now, put some muscle into it. Over here! We found it! Where? Where is it? It's right here. What did they find? Yeah. What is it? Wow. This is better than treasure island. Look at it. It's gold. It's Aladdin's cave. Look at it shine. I've never seen anything like it. I have. Ha ha ha ha ha! [Natty continues laughing] Why is natty laughing like that? It's the gold. It makes people go nuts. Remember treasure of the Sierra madre? I'm sorry, girls. This is gold, all right. Fool's gold. What do you mean? It's iron pyrite. It looks like gold, but it isn't. Is it worth a lot, anyway? It's not worth a darn thing. [Laughing] [Everyone laughing] Well, if you'd gone back at the lodge like I told you, you wouldn't have this problem. Whoa! Up you go. [Laughing] All this searching, and what we found was worthless? Natty: Heck, no. What we had today was a great day. When you get as old as I am, you'll learn that it's not what you find that matters, it's the fun you have looking for it. That's the truth, miss natty. All day today, I didn't feel like a middle-aged businessman. I felt like a 10-year-old boy hunting for treasure. It's the most fun I've had in a long time. It was pretty exciting. Not bad. I even found one of the clues, sort of. [Chuckles] Oh, Stephen, to heck with gifooley land. I'm going to recommend this experience to all my business friends. You will? They're all middle-aged children at heart. You could run this gold mine hunt every weekend. What do you say, natty? I'd be proud to! I'll give you the money to pay off the loan and spruce up the ranch. All I ask is 50% of the profits. Since daddy's the senior partner, how about 25% of the profits? Done. In fact, make it 10%. How about 5? [Mcrugger laughs] Oh, this isn't about money anymore. It's about enjoying life. Something I haven't done for a long time. I hope this works. Bart: Yes! Ok, cookie, here they come. Jessica, follow me. Heh heh heh. Stephen: Hey, stay away from the river. You! You're out of luck, Bart, 'cause our friend here's gonna help pay the back taxes and make this ranch a dude ranch again. You little cretin, what are you gonna do, take on me and Leo mcrugger? I am Leo mcrugger. My god. You know, sir, you did look familiar to me. I'm remembering, what was it, man of the year of business function yearly. Congratulations on that. Now, you've lost weight. Am I right? Maybe it's my glasses. I'm calling the sheriff and having you arrested. For what? Vandalism. Fraud. And tampering with the u.S. Mail. Mama, don't let them do this to me. It's too late, Bart. You brought this on yourself. Well, you'll never catch me. Hey! A bonus! You get to catch a bad guy! Girls, no! Don't! Don't! A trapped rat is dangerous! Weasels always get in your face! You're right, George. And these two are my ticket out of here. Whoa! Whoa! Daddy! Daddy! Put 'em down! Daddy! Girls! Stay back, or I'll feed 'em to the fishes. Please don't! Daddy! Oh, my lord, what have I done? Daddy! Daddy! Ohh-ohh-ohh! Help! Daddy, what should we do? Put on a life jacket! And helmets! Say hello to the bottom feeders. Daddy, help US! Daddy! Daddy! Hang on! Ha ha! Daddy, help! Come on. There's a trail along the river. Now we separate the men from the little girls. Daddy! You know, girls, no one under the age of 12 has ever made it down this river. This is known as the widow-maker, girls. Hang on. Because here's how it got its name. [Screaming] I'll teach you to mess with Bart gifooley, ladies. Pick up the oar and row. Take that! Wh-what are you doing? What is this? Whoa! Fine. Want to know what it's like to be up the creek without a paddle? Now you do! Help! Help! Ladies, when gifooley land is built, this is a $20 ticket. And no refund if you don't live! Whoa! Daddy! Daddy! Help US! Help US! George! Wait a minute. This is the wrong stream. We're headed for the dam! Daddy, help! Help, daddy! Daddy! Daddy! This way. Follow me. Hyah! Come on! Come on! Daddy! Help! Help, daddy! There they are. Laura: They're headed for the falls! Natty: How do we stop them? Are you happy now, Bart? Shut up! The water's getting rougher! Stephen: Just hold on! We're coming! And you shut up! Look, there they are! Daddy! Help! Hang on! Stephen: We'll meet you at the bridge! Both: Hasta la vista, Bart! Hey! Girls! Hold on! I'm coming! Grab my hand! Daddy! I'm slipping! George, help! Uhh! Uhh! Uhh! That was fun, daddy. Are you all right? Well, this is just great. Now, what about me? I mean, one mistake doesn't make me a-- a ba-a-a-a... Aah-aah-- aah! Ooh! Ohh! Sorry! [Country western music playing] This is great. I wonder how Bart's doing. [Music ends] Thanks, Sonny Jim. Ladies and gentlemen... And Bart. [Laughter] This dude ranch is going to go on for a good long time. And it's because 2 little ladies here who saved the best of the west. Good people. Good music.

Jessica Martin, age 8. This is our first summer on the ranch, and we are very happy. This is the most wonderful place on earth. So much has happened to US already. We saved the ranch from Bart gifooley, we found lightning, and George became our friend, and we have come to love natty. Through our mother's diary, we got to know her better, and we will always remember her. And now there's one more wonderful person in our lives, named Laura. Together: We're all a team, and tomorrow looks like a wonderful day. I love the west. Uh-huh. The west is sure fun. Captioning made possible by Warner Bros.
