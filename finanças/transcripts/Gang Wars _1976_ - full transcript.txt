OK, do it again. Not bad. You learn pretty fast for a cop. Yeah, well cops may be slow, but, uh, at least they're fast on the take. I guess I've just been taken by one of the best, huh? He is not one of the best Mr. Man. He is the best. Well, look who's here. And I suppose you're qualified to know who the best is? Can an elephant skate? What is it of your business? Rapport, now tell me about it. All right, all right, I get the message. I'll see you when you get back. Oh by the way, how long you going to be gone? Oh man, a week in fabulous downtown Hong Kong followed by a week of improvement for body and soul. And then, back to the States. We're going to have a master in the neighborhood, huh? You know, uh, that could be a very valuable asset to the force. Listen, I know. But don't play with me, man. You're getting lessons from me and that's it. You can come up on that morgue of yours just as long as you come as a student, but the next time-- the next time you try to recruit me into that pig pen of yours is the day I stop pulling my punches and ice you. OK, don't get excited Luke. Don't blow your cool. My apologies, all right. Just have a good trip. I don't know why that pig honky come up here. Because I owe him a favor and that's all it's about. He stuck his neck out for me when I was busted for almost killing that pusher on 116th Street. Plus, he keeps his appointments, which is more than I can say for you, mister. You're late. Where were you? Some dude in the Deuce was splash in a big roll on St. Nicholas, so I helped him to his crack game for a quarter, you dig? So then he wants to do me in, because he drops it all at once a refund to boot. To make a long story short, he whipped a piece and he takes the whole pot. Well, at least he tried to take the whole pot. Me and Tom put a showstopper on him and got the bread back. We didn't hurt him too bad. We let him go. Chinks of plenty. He was Chinese? Yeah. And while he was driving away he yelled that he'd get us. You should have been, Shifu. You would've laughed your ass. He was cursing is that not funny accent there saying that he was going to get-- can you dig this-- the Tongue after us. He was looking where he was going, and he ran his car right into a garbage truck. He tore up his whole front end. But he kept going. I thought I'd never stop laughing. The Tongue can lay something on you. Naw, me and Tom know too many of them. They'd never bother us to something like this. Which reminds me, I've got some business done in that part of town. I'll see you tonight. Wait a minute. What about the trip? Are you packed? What packed? It takes a minute. Look, bro, I'm counting on you. This is really important. Don't get waylaid. I wasn't planning on getting laid, Shifu. I'll see you later. Brother. Master Leone. Hi Shifu. What's on your mind, man? There's nothing on my mind, Shifu. Nothing. Don't hand me that. You've got an attitude. I don't have an attitude. You still thinking about New York? Naw. I just hope that it doesn't affect your performance. Don't let it hassle you, Shifu. This is easy. It's light stuff. I don't believe what you're saying. Do you know what this means? Yes, Shifu. Well, you know that isn't light stuff. Where you coming from? This is what you spent years of your life building for. I can pull through it, Shifu. You know I'm in good shape. Yes, but you need your mind and your body. Either one alone is not enough. Rodan, what I'm telling you is basic. You know all this. Admit it, you still thinking about getting at those guys back in New York. Naw, Shifu. You got it all wrong. You got me all wrong. I just want you to understand one thing, Ro. What goes around comes around. The situation in New York is temporary. You're in China now, and what you do here is going to stay with you for the rest of your life. So let's get it together and stop dreaming. I can understand where you're coming from, Shifu. I can dig it. Now that your physical power is of the ninth degree, it is time for your mind and spirit to ascend to the same level. To achieve this, you are to choose a place known only to your spirit. You will recognize it when you come upon it. There you must retreat into meditation. You must let nothing disturb you. From your companions here, you must choose a guardian to protect you. This cat has been in a trance for hours. What the hell does he think I am? A Watch dog or something. Rodan! Rodan, where are you? Rodan! Rodan! Rodan, where are you? Down here, Luke. You won't believe what I just found. Hey, weren't you supposed to be watching me? You know, Luke, you may be better stuff than me when it comes to fighting, but that don't mean you can tell me nothing. Let's get outta here. This place has strange vibes. Sure. Sure. We gotta be in Hong Kong by morning to leave. I'll be right with you. Hey, man, where you going? Blew that. Burn, burn. It's time to make some money. All right, you call them and I'll follow. Hey, where's your man? There he is. Got it. See you in a bit. Hey, go get him a car. Thank you. Hey, let's have the package. What is this, some kind of a setup. Let's say that a certain mutual friend of ours was not satisfied with his winning this morning and wants to get back his investment. The cocaine please. Did you see me at the crap game? Why I'm gonna break your-- Cool it, Rodan. Cool it. The man's got a ride. Let's get it together and then come back. OK. OK. Now Cool it. Give them the stash, give them the stash. I'm gonna get ya. Your little ass is-- Cool it! Cool it! Come on, dog. Come on, let's go. Let me go, man, let me go. All right, let's go show the suckers who they just fucked with. Hey, Mike, come on, we're late for school. OK. Just when I need a helping hand. Someone to understand I always turn to you. You're standing there with outstretched arms as shelter in the storm that I can sail into. You see me through. And when the tables turn and you're feeling sad I'll be best refreshment you've ever had. I'll make you glad. That's why you and I believe in each other. That's why you and I believe. That's why you and I believe in each other. That's why you and I believe. It's true we sometimes have our fights, but even that's all right because it's turning now.S You seem to make my life worthwhile. You keep me in a smile. That's what I need most of. My precious love, I want to share my every treasure with you, and be a never ending pleasure for you. You want that too. That's why you and I believe in each other. That's why you and I believe. That's why you and I believe. The Chinese brothers and third world people, they're not our enemy. Why you coming down so hard on them? Why? Just get the two that hit you. Because they all want to get in on the act. Besides, they got it coming. - Give me my money. - What money? Listen, man, we don't have go through this no more if you give me my cash. I told you, I'm not going to give you any money because I don't owe you. - What do you mean? You're gonna tell me you're not gonna give me what's mine. This kind of hassle can turn into an all out war. The gang fighting isn't working. That's not what martial arts is all about. I'd lay low for awhile. What lay low? You should've seen those cats, bet they were a bunch of faggots. Right on, man, they took one look at our faces and split, law and why? They'd rather fight a gorilla in a phone booth just to mess with us. Hey, I've told you to calm down a little bit or otherwise you're going to have to get out. Man, give me my money, all right? I mean, that's all we need. You'll have the pigs coming down on our head busting up our score. And since they know we're martial artists, they'll come in with shotguns. No way they can pull that shit. I'll put an end to it and fast. We're together and we better anything that comes up down. This isn't time. Hey, what's that you got around your neck? I gave my money, man. Hey, man, don't walk away from me. Now I told you, and I've asked you nicely several times, keep it down. This time I'm telling you! Or I'll put both you're asses out on the street. Hey, I told you to stay out of my business. They should have known that that fine sister was a karate expert. Now they do. Hey, man. What do you say, man? What's going on, man? I've had some static with a bunch of Chinese niggers man. Yeah? And I'm take the Bjs to smoke their ass tonight. I'm going to take this fist and punch him in his yellow-- Hey, Al. How's it going? How's the business running? Ah, not bad. Same old thing, you know. Yeah, I figured since you're divorced, you'd be a real swinger by now, hitting all the single joints. Nah, that's not my style. How's Jo anyway? You hear much from her? Well, besides canceled alimony checks, not much. You know she moved to Philly, so we don't see much of each other. Oh, Chris, I forgot to tell you. This sad sack-- Christopher, how do you do? Nice to see you. I can tell we're going to be great partners. - Great what? - Partners. With my degree in criminology-- And my degree in patience. We'll be another Watson at Holmes. Nice to see you. I've Got to go see the chief. What the hell was that? I was going to tell you, but that's Mike Rothburn's son. They sent him up here and you needed a drivers. A driver not a joker. Mike? Mike Rothburn, Mike Rothburn from the complaint department? Aw, come on. Well, why not? Aw, come on. Now take it easy. It's good for departmental diplomacy. Politics, you know. Politics? That's what's wrong with this goddamned department. Hey, Chris, give a trial. I'll give him a trial, I'll give me a trial, right, but I know what he's going to be giving me. Alan's office. Yeah, Hey, Chris, it's for you. Yeah? When? OK, I'll be right over. Mark, you better get our, uh, new recruit out of the Chief's office. Looks like he's going get his first chance to play Watson. What's up? Uh, subway, looks like murder one. To smell this bad, he'd have to been dead for a couple of days. Yeah. Why didn't we find it sooner? I don't know, Sam, I don't know. The question is, how did he die? I mean, the body looks like it's been mangled by uh, by a meat grinder. OK, boys. Take him away. And, uh, make sure I get a full autopsy made, huh? Hey, Chris. Who's your new friend? Sam, my, uh, new driver. Ed, local school reporter. How do you do? Nice to meet you. Well, uh, what's the theory, Mr. Super sleuth? Ed, the last time I gave you a hunch, you had every suspect out of town in 15 minutes. Now just give me a week to get an autopsy and get some details down, and then maybe, just maybe, I might give you a statement. Right now, do me a favor, and get lost, huh? Aw, that's no way to talk to a journalist. Hey, you know what the penalty is for impersonation in this state? Go find yourself a corpse. Nice to have met you. Christopher? Yeah? Do you really have a theory? No, not really. But there is a possibility that, uh, there's a gang war going on between the black gangs and the Chinese gangs, and that guy was definitely no WASP. You know what I think? I think the best move to make is keep an eye on each end in this town. Right now? Right now. Oops, sorry. Hey, wait! Wait! Hey! Hey! Hey, you driver, wait. Please, help me, somebody. Please, help me. I can't move. My foot is caught. Please, help. OK, OK. I'm-- I'm coming. Hurry, it's dark in here. I'm scared. Where the hell are you? I can see you. Gosh, damn, dark in here. OK, OK. Coming. Over here. May the peace of the Almighty be with you. May your soul rest in peace. May the peace of your life with you forever, and ever, and ever, amen. You all right, Sam? Yeah, I've just never seen anything like that before. Yeah, neither have I. Looks like two murders in two days in the same station, Jesus. Well, looks like your murderer wasn't greedy. They say they found a full wallet on him, so that leaves out robbery. That's good thinking, Ed, that's very good thinking. Guess what, I wanna make a statement about yesterday. OK, just a moment. OK. That, uh, body that was found in the subway. Yeah. It was definitely dead. And the department figures that the probable cause of death was murder. Thank you. You wanna know what I think? Yeah. About four years ago it was a story in the papers. It seems that when they were building the old subways, they had to break through the sewers. And it seems that a lot of workmen broke through the sewers and were attacked by animals. These were animals that had become mutant, dogs, cats, rats, alligators, all the throwaways. And they developed senses that other animals didn't have, fangs, claws. They're wild. They lived off each other. Survival of the species. And they attacked the workmen. Now I think it's very possible that those workmen did not seal up the sewers where they should have been sealed up, and that those animals are roaming through the subways. Hey, thanks. You're welcome. For the story. Hey, come on. You're not gonna print that are ya? Sounds like an Edgar Alan Poe story for Christ sakes. Hey, look, Sam. Let's start using some rational logic, huh? And lesson one, keep your mouth shut in front of reporters. Save the horror stories for the kids. Come on. Magmore, stay here with this body until the guys from the morgue get down. Police point the finger at underground animals. According to a well-informed source, the recent subway murders may be attributed to mutant cats, rats, and dogs inbred and inhabiting the subways for several years. Christ, that's all we need. We'll have every little old lady who sees a mouse asking us for protective custody. Well, I got carried away. Well, next time don't get carried away. Now, we've got definite reports on fighting between the Chinese and the black gangs in the same areas as the murders. Now this first guy was Chinese. The other guy just may have been some unfortunate bystander. But the way both bodies were mutilated, I can't help thinking that-- well, anyway, this is what we're going to do. OK, I put men on stakeout at every subway station from 168th Street down to 96th Street. That gives us a Cordon around the entire area where the murders took place. I've also got a hotline to a team of social workers down in Chinatown that'll keep us informed of any unusual movement. If anything happens, we'll know about it. Hopefully, we'll know about it in time. Christopher, what about my theory about the, uh-- Don't worry about it, Sam. Even one of your saber-toothed rats won't get through the net we've put up. Hey, man, there's two chinks at our back. As if I didn't know. Come on, let's get out this cage. Oh, wow, we got ourselves some static. I know you. He's wasted, let's get outta here. Yeah. Great. Ah, let's see what we got here. Christopher, I got an idea. Yeah? Why don't you come up to the club this weekend. We'll play a little tennis. Nah, nah, that's not my day. Besides, we got a case to work on. Ah, It'll be good for you. It'll get your mind off the case. Bleh. I don't play tennis, Sam. What-- what do you mean you don't play tennis? What I said. I don't play tennis. Everybody plays tennis. Car 701, proceed to 135th Street and Lenox. Car 701, proceed to 135th Street and Lenox This is 701, what's up? Possible homicide, Oriental, medium height, medium-weight, gang member, Red Dragons. This is 701, have 604 take this call out. OK, Sam, let's go. We're going to Luke's place. Aren't you gonna play that? What for? The jacket and location tell me all we need to know, and, uh, I wanna speak to Luke. I think he might know something about these murders. Take your money here for nothing, goddamn subway. Too many people, too much pollution, too much of everything. How you, what are you doing? You crazy kid, what are you smoking for? He doesn't know what he's doing, this kid. This kind of place makes you crazy. They call me crazy. Who are you anyway, huh? What's the matter, huh? Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh? The women here, they wear such short dresses with their crotch sticking out. I don't know know what the hell is the matter with the people these days. Look at her, look at her, oh my. Look at her. Who the hell do you think you are. Oh, it's what's the matter, huh? Don't you like my looks, baby. I was prettier than you, believe me, I was prettier than you. Yeah, to hell with her. I don't know what they're doing in New York. Colleges take the money, they raise the rates. You know what they're doing now? They're ticketing $0.50 cents. They should drop dead with the money. Children, who needs children in this world. Oh, look her. Oh, honey, honey, you do it for love or for money. I never saw a guy with his crotch so closed. I can't stand this place. I'm getting outta here. I'm going to Coney Island. Car 701, Car 701, proceed to IRT station 137 Street and Broadway. Damn it, they don't give me a chance to breath around here. Sam, call headquarters and tell them I'm stuck right now. Yeah, brother. The governor of Jersey has legalized the numbers. They even showed a damn results on television during the news. In Jersey? Mhm. What? They won't let us have nothing. Ah, damn, the numbers. Man, you know what-- Hold on, brother. The man. Well, my, my, if it ain't the guardian of the piece. Are you lost or are you looking for some desperate criminal that may be seeking refuge in here. That's funny. That's very funny. Now why don't you go back and tell Luke that, uh, Lieutenant Alan wants to see him. Say, man, we don't run no messenger service. So why don't you just go back there and tell him yourself? Sam, wait here. I'll be right back. Sure. Bartender, could I have a large Coke, please with just to squeeze of lime, please. Of course, are you sure you can handle it? Of course he can handle it. He's momma's big man. And you figure all these murders tie-in with my school. Get your facts together before you start accusing me, my man. Look, God damn it, I'm not accusing anyone. I just got news of the fourth victim in two days, all within a 10 block radius, and two of them were Chinese. Now what the hell am I supposed to think? And I'll tell you something else, Luke, if any of these murders involve any of Rodan's people there's going to be a hell of a lot of trouble. I'll bust ass all over the God damn place. Look, jam, you do not come to my turf talking about busting ass. You gotta bring some to get some. Now look god damn it. I came here asking you for help. I think we'd all be a lot better off if we work together on this thing. Take your hand off of me. Look, I've been under a lot of pressure, man. These murders have been messy. There-- there's something inhuman about them. Outside of Sam's cat theory, the only other possibility I have is, well, you know what that is. Look, Luke, I'm begging you for help. Can't promise you anything. But if I hear anything, I'll let you know. That's all I'm asking. So there are alligators down there that are twice as the size of ordinary alligators with fangs that would chop a leg off like that. They're rats the size of cats down there, and they live off each other. The dogs, the cats-- Hey, hey, you're Sam Spade. To get off it and go, huh? Hang on. Anyway, um, I gotta leave, ladies. Duty calls. Y'all come back now, you hear? So exciting. Yeah, I wanted to hear the end myself. Shut up. Shut up Shut up I said. Shut up. Hey, lady, you're looking real good. Let me go! Shut up, one word out of you, woman, one word and you're a dead piece of ass. Take your filthy hands Off a me! What's the matter? Don't you like it, huh? Help! Lady, come with me! Somebody, won't somebody help me! God, help me! All right, all right, calm down. Now what was it that attacked you? Hm? Um-- What was it, if it wasn't human? Who was it that was killed? It wasn't real. Some deformed monster-- Some deformed monster. Well, I think it got him. All right, all right, it's going to be OK. Just calm down. Sam, take her out and get a full statement made. Alan's office. Well, at least one part of her story was right anyway. Our friend got another one, same story. This guy's so that he can be identified. Looks like a lion got him. That's five murders in three days. Four in the subway. It, that's what she said. Like it was some kind of monster. I don't think these subway killings have anything to do with the, uh, gang wars. I think this is some kind of maniac. Mark, I want 135th and 145 street stations blocked off, all trains going through there to be express. I think it's time you went down and smoked this thing out. It's cold. Shit, I warned them. What happened? A gangland killing. A member of the Blackjacks. They just brought another one out of the subway. Who? I don't know. Jess, clear these people back. We have three cars over here, and we have people posted all around. OK, fine, beautiful. Who is it, Sam? Who is it? All right, get back. This god damn gang fight. It's time for me to take a trip downtown and settle this once and for all. Now, Luke, listen to me. Tom may have been killed by the Red Dragons, but I don't think Rodan was. There's somebody else down there and we're going down there to smoke them out. Take it to court, Chris. I got enough proof right here to tell me who did this number, and I'm going to fix it. Now hold it, Luke. I'm telling you it wasn't the Chinese gangs. You're just going to make things worse by getting blood on your hands. Like I said mister, you do it your legal white way. I know who did this to my brother, and I'm going to fix it, and I'm going to do what's got to be done. I said no. I told you before, stay out of my life. Are you out of your mind? Where's your leader? None of your business. Then I want you. Now before I punch your face in, I want to know just how you killed my student, Rodan. What kind of rules do you fight by cornering Rodan in the subway. I do not understand. Your friends there, they stole cocaine from Rodan, and now you've killed him. Wait. There's a rule among us, that we all must fight to defend our brother. But if we had known that your brother would dishonor any of us, we wouldn't have fought. They have caused two deaths, one of yours, one of our own. They will be dealt with. However, as for Rodan, your brother, his death is not our doing. What do you mean? First you iced Tom. Then you cornered Rodan in the subway. No, it was not us. Then who? Come with me. It is time you found out the truth. I'll go with you, but I warn you, if it's a trick, I'll get you first. He will help you. Does this have something to do with China? Does it, Mr. Curtis? How'd you know my name? Because of this. The Amulet of Mendow. I told him to put it back. I thought it might be sacred, but why would your people kill him for it. Please, Mr. Curtis, let me continue. This amulet holds the answer to all that has happened in recent days. It was brought to me by a number of the Red Dragons. Unfortunately, the killer must have thought he still had it. That is why he is dead. You come 10,000 miles, and to be foiled in a search. There's still hope. It is amazing. I don't understand. 2,000 years ago the sorcerer, Master Lung-ton would allow seven men to be possessed by demons. And these he would use to terrorize villages and cities. Master Chang-dao produced the emerald in which he trapped the spirit of the demon. This is the amulet your friend took. From this, the monster is released into the world. As long as this amulet exists , the demon is deprived most of his power. Even though he is still strong, he is unable to tolerate light. That is why your subways is a perfect place for him to hide. In my head, your story is fantastic, but in my heart, I know that you speaking the truth. The demon will stop at nothing to regain this amulet. By destroying it, it will be free forever, immortal, and indestructible. In a way I feel responsible for this. I chose Rodan to go with me in the first place. What must I do? You must wage the combat. Our only chance is this amulet. Challenge the demon. Defeat him and we are saved. Lose and the demon will eat the soul of the man who challenged him. The demon or try to attack your mind. He can assume the forms of those you love most, and those you fear most. It will use every trick at its disposal. I shall try to help in the only way I can. While you are fighting, I will place my mind with yours. Perhaps together we will be stronger than one alone. This is for those rats underground. Squeaking, squeaking, squeaking, squeaking, yes. And then, all of you, God is nobody's fool. Can't you see? This is the only thing that can stop him. I know you can't buy it. I couldn't buy it either. That's right I can't buy it, especially the part about you going down there. I don't need any dead heroes. I've got four guys to take care of that. Chris, you won't be able to hit it with anything that can stop it. As a matter of fact, you're going to be picked off alone or together. If I don't make it, then you can in. Spiritual leaders at best. Moses is dead. Mohamed is dead. Buddha is dead. And I'm feeling so-- That's my job. So for the last time, the answer's no. Christopher, let's go. OK. OK. Wait here. I'll be right back. Pestiferous rats, shrieking, squeaking, lusting to sink their teeth into your weak heart. Big, black rats. Where's Luke? Sam. Down this way. Luke. Luke. Why don't you come with me. Luke, make love to me. Show your face! Come on. How are you feeling, brother? Fine, man. I'm glad you came. Killer Curtis. How you doing? It's good to see you buddy. Killer, huh? Hey, um, whatever happened to the, um-- Demon? Yeah. We didn't find anything but you down there. And as for that, uh, fancy piece of jewelry, well, uh, the amulet, we're letting the priest take care of that. Yeah, it's my first miracle. No more murders, no more demon, and your amulets on a slow boat the China. That's funny. That's the title of a song by Cole Porter and George Gershwin I think.
