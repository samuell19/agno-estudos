To the cemetery. Okay, and? He drove her to the cemetery. When he turned to look at the seat... - Koko quit making it up. - You scared? - What did he find? - A gun. What? What gun? A real gun. Why would she have a gun? - Well, for self-defense. - Quit making it up. Ghosts don't pack guns. Let him talk. Go on, continue. What he found at the seat was... a bloodied ID card. He found the place. It was an old sawmill. The door was opened by Isak. The man showed him the ID card. Isak said: "This is my wife, who died twenty years ago." Come on, Koko. That's a stupid story. It's not a story. That really happened. - Did you guys hear that? - What's that'? Gypsy! He scared you so much. He didn't scare me, he just surprised me. - Let's go home. - But it only just got dark. Marica must be home when it's dark. Come on. A bit longer. Nina must also be home when it's dark. - Come on... - Let's go. Give us some light here. Give it here. Can I push it? You should've seen your face Not even Bozo would get so scared. Very funny. So did you see him? He didn't scare me! Yes, he did. As if you wouldn't get scared. Oh, so you did get scared? That'd be like me getting scared of my pigeons. You're even scared of storms. And you, of worms.

Marica! Breakfast time! Children! Koko, let's go. Give me just two more minutes. I smell crépes. Marica, you're too small for roller skates. You'll get them when you grow up a bit. But, Mommy, Emica got a new bike from her uncle from Germany. It's so pretty. It even has a basket. - Nina got her old one, which... - But you do have a bike. Marica. - But Mommy, it's not as pretty. - Go on, eat. Go on. You cant even ride a bike. I can, with training wheels. Babies can do it with training wheels. Marica, when you have an uncle in Germany, you'll get such a bike. But, Daddy! Mummy, when I grow up... - Josip, you'll be late. - Don't discard the bacon! But it's for Gypsy. - Give it here. - Josip! Look at you. Off I go. See you. But, Mommy, when I grow up, it will be too small for me. We'll pay off the mower by then, so you'll get a new one, okay? There. Nede? Yes? Come here. What is it? - Just come. - What happened? Don't worry. When I get a new bike, you can have my old one. You're so stupid. I don't see who could've done it. Who could've done it? Crazy people! Who else? Dad? What happened? Our mower got stolen. - Who did it? - Thieves. How? Gypsy! Come here! Gypsy! Gypsy. I wish he was allowed to sleep with me. Farewell, dear Gypsy. I'll avenge Gypsy, Marica. And then I'll get you a new dog. But I'll never be able to love any other as much as Gypsy. Good morning! Neighbor, it that true? - Did they rob you too? - They did. Yes, they did. Imagine they stole our brand-new mower. - Jesus. - What's worse, they poisoned our dog. It's terrible. Who could do such a thing? - I don't know. - Dear God, why do they rob us? Why? The police should hear of it. The Lucics should report it, also. Yeah, well, we tried to tell them, but they say it's no use. I'm afraid the police won't do a thing. Oh, they'll sing a different tune when they hear from me. - You ought to. - This won't be the end of it. - You think so? - Mom the bus is coming. Was it better? - No, it wasn't! - Want to show me yourself? Your belly just tips you over. Just pretend that you're only going to dip your head... then just smoothly dive in with your whole body. Watch it, Bozo, or you'll trip! Since when can he run? Guys! You have to hear this! WANTED DEAD OR ALIVE That's very tasty. Just... Neighbor! - So how did it go? - What can I tell you? One of us has to be poisoned for them to take it seriously. - I can't believe it. - What can one do? Wait. They're really willing to give us the reward? I think it's fishy. That's what they said. You catch the thief, you get a large financial reward. I don't know. I've only seen that happen in comics. They really said so. Well, when I think about it, it does seem logical. They probably don't have time for it, so they motivate people to handle it. Then there is just one thing we can do for now. Night... Watch! There's no sleeping tonight. Hey, guys, though. Not a word to the girls. Are you crazy? Of course. And you Branjc, don't go saying things to Emica. We all know what a talker she is. Girls are evil. They could ruin everything. And it's too dangerous for them. Of course, Romeo. We'll gel the thief! You are so childish, guys. Did you see him watching us? There's no way that he heard us. Maybe he has superhuman hearing. Yeah, right. Maybe he picks his nose. Guys, don't mess it up! - Bye! - Bye! I've read that it's best to drink plenty of coffee. - But on an empty stomach. - Can you make coffee? Sure. It's easy. I think that willpower is crucial. - Like the samurai! - What, can you be a samurai? Oh, sure. What's so funny? When did you get here, Ivo? What, did I scare you? What are you doing? - Conjuring spirits. - Come on. It's easy for you kids. A bit of soccer, a bit of swimming. - No worries, no smarts. - As if you have it hard. It's hard for anyone with a bit of brains. Milic. Terribly funny. What's with him? No idea. So, did you grow up a bit since my last visit, or what? - Mira, we talked about it. - What if they enter at night? - They won't. - Right, they won't. Vinko! Coming! Come and eat, your dinner's getting cold. Tomo, I'm very scared. Mira... I'm afraid I won't be able to sleep tonight at all. The baby just kicked. Did he? And my legs hurt terribly. I could barely stand in the kitchen. Know what? I think we should move things from the shed to the house. Mira, please. Our valuables are in the bank, the rest is insured. There's no need. Vinko, don't play with your food! Mom, I told you not to ca me Vinko. What should I call you? "Roach"? Should I call my own son "Roach"? Vinko, please, don't make Mom mad. Dad, I'm not hungry. Go change your clothes. Look at you. You shouldn't have made that much, Mom. You don't eat at all in Zagreb. You'll eat properly at your Mom's I do eat, Mom. Ivo you're too thin. What will people say? I met Mrs. Toncic this morning, before they left. She asked if you were sick. Imagine that. You tell him, Vlado. Listen to Mom, Ivo. And you? - What? - Why aren't you eating? I'll eat later. Look at all the food I made, I spent the day cooking. Here, Mom. I'm eating. What if we have a break-in tonight, eh? What if they pillage your barbershop? - Where's our livelihood then? - Calm down, Lidija. I'll sleep there tonight okay? The Miliés didn't have anything valuable, and they still poisoned their dog. What if they poison us? - God, what kind of people are they? - Come on, drop it. Let us dine in peace, please. I'm done. Do you want to eat, Dad? Later. Want me to make you a slice? Did you take it? What, Dad? The gun. So it just vanished, eh? I don't know, Dad. I haven't seen it. Turn that light off. Let's go to sleep. I'm not sleepy. Well, I am. The light bothers me. I startled you. Mom... Okay, I'll turn the light off. Be right back. Mom? Good morning. Mom where are my glasses? I'm not gonna wear that patch! It's for your own good, hon. When did I fall asleep last night? By the time I brushed my teeth, you were out. The Toncics were robbed, too. I just heard. Poor people. They are visiting their daughter. They have to come back now. Do you think it's someone we know? I don't know. But it's certainly someone who knows all of us. Knows all of us... I've got to go. Tomo! Tomo, come. I saw them doing it. Really? I couldn't stop them, they almost got me. They were armed, both of them. Got you? Yeah! I barely made it. I sneaked away', quiet as a ninja, hid by a tree, jumped on a branch, and... Koko! - So it's two of them. - Yes, two. Describe them. Come to breakfast, Tomo. Hey. Koko. I've got to go. See you at the lake. Just hurry! I'm looking for my... My friend, I mean... Koko! We were playing hide and seek, so... Is he here? That's all right, then. I'll be off, then. So, eh, goodbye. I knew you'll be the one to see them. Well, they rob only his neighbors. First the Lucics, now the Toncics. - What's that supposed to mean? - Don't be so jealous, guys! It doesn't matter who saw them, it matters that... Go on, pull, pull, pull! ...we catch them! Some are lucky with fish, and some with thieves! - It's just my mastery. - Sure, when you have the best rod. Guys, guys! What is that? - I was at his place! - At whose place? He almost attacked me! Give me some water. Where did you go? Who attacked you? 1 saw him outside last night. - Who? - Isak! Isak? Last night I saw him walking down the street to the Toncics. Then he disappeared. Just now, he threatened me with an ax. Isak is the thief! He knew that the Lucics sold their plot and that the Toncics were away. And that Gypsy would maul him. But I saw them at it. Two of them. They were just a meter away from me. - I barely made it out. - Using your superpowers. So, we have to find the second guy. - Someone has to trail Isak tonight. - Are you crazy? Let's draw for it. Don't you worry. He's not going to hit a kid with glasses. I couple more minutes. Ouch! Stop poking it. But I'm hungry. Rub your belly, then. What's that, now? Read the secret signs! What's the sign for "get lost"? It's this. You have to be like a wild animal. Wear something dark and pull a sock over your head. You'll have to get down on your elbows and crawl low, like a soldier. Lick your finger and raise it high to check which way the wind blows. So that Bobby doesn't pick your scent. Hi, boys. Hi! Why are you here? That smells so good! Are you talking about serious things? Yes. Roach hat diarrhea this morning. Come on, boys. We brought you cherries. And chocolate! All right. Someone forgot to come home! Oh, leave him be. We're busy. Oh, yeah? Doing what? Important things. Hey, Ivo, what's in that box? I caught a bird. Lucky you. - An actual bird? - Can we see it? Aww, can I have it' as a gift? As a gift? What are you, crazy? Oh, come on. What? Muscles are muscles. Want to arm wrestle? I'll beat you! Go on, Koko. You can do it! I'll bet you a hundred that I can beat you and Fatso together. Deal! Deal. Ready? Go! - Koko! Koko! - Roach! Roach! - Ivo! Ivo! - Koko! Koko! - Roach! Roach! - Ivo! Ivo! Not bad, kids. Pleasure doing business with you. Let's go, kid. Hey, Ivo. I need you. Remember the bet we made? Yes. You lost. I never asked my dad. He's looking for the gun now, so... Come on. Gambling is gambling. Come on. Tomo, hurry up. What happened? It's nothing. His dad is pestering him again. Mom's really afraid of thieves. Yeah, but she shouldn't be. Neither should you, you know. I have my own methods. Who says I'm afraid? And have you seen how strong I am? I'll be able to defend you all with my bare hands. So, what, do you fancy that little blonde girl? Emica? Oh, no. The guys are cool, right? Oh, yeah, they're cool. - Come in, dinner's getting cold! - Coming! You're not going to read at the table, are you? I'm not that hungry. Is it what I think? What? You're scared. What are you talking about, Mom? I've been watching you for two days, Bozo. What's the matter with you? Son, who'd want to burgle us? What would they steal? Mom, you got it all wrong! All right, all right, don't overreact. Let's go and eat. Move your hand. Are you insane? Well, I've got to watch your back. - Mine went farther. - No way! - The farthest one is mine. - Want to bet? - Have you heard? - I have. Is it true? Imagine, they stole a year's supply of pain from my Zvonimir's store. That's not all. They stole Emica's bike, sent by my brother from Germany. Stealing paint, that I can understand. But a child's bike? And a pink one! We'll report it. - Have you heard? - They stole Emica's bike. Mrs Radic, how is Emica? As you can imagine. This isn't random, kids. What? - Go, console your girlfriend. - You're so stupid. Or is she Ivos girlfriend, perhaps? I just asked how Emica was. How would you feel if you got robbed? Wait, guys, wait. Look, that's what we need. So you really plan to steal it? - It's not stealing. It's borrowing. - Perhaps if we just explained... Are you crazy? We can't jeopardize the mission. Tomo, don't play with fire. As if you have a better idea. No, no! We really need those binoculars. Who's in? I am. And I am. And I am. Okay. We just need to come up with a plan. While you guys were tailing Isak, someone came to Emica's. So, we need to split up. Right, we need to split up. The question is: who's next? I don't see why they'd need a pink bike. Oh, what? See? You need to visit Emica. Why? To check her out. You're all so stupid. I don't get it. Koko, come on. Don't make me tell you you're stupid. Of course, you'll check out if Emica heard something last night. Stop it! LOOK at you. Wash up, for starters. - Hi, Tomo. - What are you doing here? Hi, Emica! Just checking out how you're doing. Come in. My parents are still at the police. All right. All right, okay. But it was so pretty. Who knows who will ride it now. But to be honest, I don't care that much about the bike. I'd prefer roller skates. But it was to be a gift for Marica, once she outgrows training wheels. She liked it a lot, you know. Bu then, Nina would be offended, And Mom wouldn't let me do it, maybe. When I think about it, perhaps it's best that it got stolen. So you're positive you haven't heard anything last night? Why do you keep asking that? Well, maybe we could help you. Help me? And who would "we" be? Well, nobody. I'll flip it. My brother has asked for a tape player for his next birthday. Ivo? He is so lucky. I'd like a tape player, too. You've actually come to interrogate me about the theft. No, I haven't. Tomo? In fact, I did. What's your plan? Come on, tell me. Please. Please, please. Look, I really can't. What if I promise to give you a great clue if you tell me everything? What kind of a clue? Something I overheard last night. Liar. Tomo Branjc! He's never coming out. I'm hungry. Rub your belly, then. They're really stealing binoculars? Not stealing, borrowing. Imagine you get that reward! You'd be in the papers! Want some more Cedevita? No, thanks. So, what is it you had to tell me? What? Well, the clue you heard last night. Well... For a moment, I woke up, and heard one robber tell the other: "Now we will..." Uh. Tomo, it was silly of me to say that. I wasn't thinking. I heard nothing. Really? Forgive me! I just wanted you to tell me about it. Forgive me, please. You're not mad at me now, right? Promise you won't tell anyone. I promise, of course. It's our shared secret, Tomica. Have to go. Don't be mad, please. Let's go. You whistle. Good afternoon, young man. Good afternoon. How do you do? Such a polite and loud young man. That's needed: pluck! Can I help you? Well, no. Where are you going? To Grandma's. Ah, to Grandma's. That's so nice. I used to have a grandma. Well, hurry up, then. Don't make Grandma wait. Goodbye. Goodbye, young man. What are you doing here? Pablo, Pablo. Didn't we say that this can't lay on the floor? I don't want to hear it. I know it. I know all of your tricks. Let's see... "Under the cover of night, "I put on a mask that hides me from..." Ivo! I knew you would win. Win? In the arm wrestling. Oh yeah. I knew that, too. Ivo, where are you going? None of your business. Ivo, come on, stop. Come here for a second. I have something for you. Could you move over a bit, please? There. So, what do you have for me? Well, what happened to that bird? Nothing, I have it at home. So, can I have it? I told you, you can't. I think I'll get it as a gift once I tell you this. About Tomica. But, please, don't tell Tomo I told you. Don't worry about it, kid. And I'll give you the bird. Have you seen, friend, how fast I'm improving, hm? Climbing has become child's play for me. Yeah. Practice. Yes, you're right. Enough of the playing. I've become agile. No reason to wait any longer. Tomorrow... I spring into action. Yes. Yes! Yes. Sorry to bother you. I've lost my ball. It might have fallen in through your window. I have no time for talk now. When did he tell you he'd come? I don't know. He always comes before dinner. Hey! Stop right there. Koko, what? Are you wet? - Just a minute, let me change... - No, no, no, no. Come here. - Where have you been? - At Roach's. And it's raining at Roach's, eh? It's not. We were just playing. Koko, are you aware that criminal are out there? It's very dangerous! Oh, don't overreact. Don't take that tone with Mom. You're grounded! - Dad... - No dads! - But... - No buts! Go on. Marica, eat. I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE UP TO Tomo, you'll choke on it. - It must be off. - Where to? - Morning. - Morning. Do we have salami? We don't. Mom, look at Tomo. He's pale as a sheet! Let me see. Honey, you are pale. - I'm fine. - You must be anemic. I'm fine! I'll cook some liver for lunch. See how Mom's cocking helped Ivo recover. I've got to go. Why, are you in love? Koko! You have visitors! So boys, how is your vacation? Tons of fun, right? - Yes... - And what are you up to? - We swim. - We swim a lot. We read. - We fish. - We fish. Just avoid the midday sun. I always tell that to my Koko. Yes. My Mom tells me that, too. We do need to care about you. See. Koko isn't it better that you hang around the house than wherever? - Yeah, yeah. - Isn't that right? - Yes! - Of course. Mum can we have some juice? How about elderberry? - Yes! - You are so unanimous. I'll be right back, Koko. - What happened? - Come. "I kike to trample roaches." "This is your first..." "and final warning." "I know what you're up to" What is this? He pinned it with this. And you? No. 'He didn't get any. Did he have a tomcat? What? Mario is the thief. Here, boys. My homemade elderberry juice. You can all stay for dinner. We'll have stuffed peppers. - Okay? - Okay! - Just say if you need anything. - Thanks. - What? - What? I heard him talk to his tomcat. He literally said he was the thief, springing into action tomorrow. Mario left us the messages? - Mario, or the other guy? - I'm more worried about the other guy. Either Mario saw us... or somebody talked. What if they're watching us now? If they're watching us now... let them see we're not scared. Koko, what are you doing? I'm sorry! We need to tail Mario. I'm grounded. Don't want to risk it. - I'll go! - And I! Okay. Blackie, take the binoculars and observe from home. What about me? Get a good night's sleep. We'll see what happens tomorrow. Stop it, I can't hear a thing. It's in English, anyway. So? I speak English. I can even translate. At the edge of a wood The source of woe stood If you would I'd... I'd find a friend, if I could Within a distant brotherhood And in the quiet night When dreams should take flight I'm powerless from flight Unsure if you'll grace my sight You are... I really don't know what to call you anymore. You shallow creep. You think you can harass me? Some poet you are. And yet you ruin flowers! Little, pretty flowers that I raised! Shame on you! Double shame on you! - But, beloved... - You're a creepy termite, not a poet! - Shame on you for harassing me! - But I love you! If I ever see you here again, I'll really do something terrible. Something terrible. Terrible! Terrible! Understood? Still, you know what this means? - Hey. - Hey. So, how did it go? I played my part perfectly. They never suspected a thing. I Knew I could trust you. So, now what? I was tipped about tomorrow. I know when and where the thieves will be. I'll catch them and turn them in. You just need to stall the kids somehow. They mustn't find out. This is not a game. Get it? Got it. - If you do well... - You'll give me the gun back. I'll give you the gun back, plus haft the reward money. But if you mess up... Listen now. Did you hear my question? We'll sell it. Once we do, will it be enough? I don't care about selling! I came for the money! Where's the money? What are you two looking at? Where's the money? Well, we couldn't get the money, but we did get this merchandise. You call this "merchandise"? This old crap here? Are you crazy? Listen up. This is how we'll do it. Tomorrow night, I'll come pick this up. I don't want lo see either of you ever again, is that clear? Is that clear? Run faster! Run! Run! Run! Faster! Let go. Let go of it. Let go of him. Get go! Oh, come on, let go. What do you want? The boys are downstairs. What time is it? It's nine. I woke up before you. Koko. - Listen to this. - I heard them last night! We know their exact plans. Guys... We've got them. Well. No fever, but claims that he's sick. What are you in bed for? The boys are waiting at the lake. Koko, want some juice? Cookies? No, thank you. Excuse me. What's the matter? I'm sick. Blackie heard those guys. They'll rob Mr. Jura's. We'll meet at ten and intercept them. Imagine, it's Blackie who figured it out! Tomo? I have to sleep. So, there can be no tardiness. We'll be there at ten, waiting. Perhaps we should really call the cops. What's with you, Bozo? Did you get it from Tomo? Look, it's always possible they knew I was listening. Then kiss the reward goodbye. Hey, someone should bring rope. Rope? So we can tie them until people come. How did you imagine it would be? Just stop it. If you have rope, bring it. I have to go home. Are you still grounded? Bravo, son. Just keep learning English. The international language. Spoken by everyone with any personal pride! Dad? How do you say "I'm proud of my family"? Son, you're not grounded anymore. Yes! Marina, we'll teach you English as well. Such pranks. It was really easy. Everyone bought it, even Roach. - You told them, it's at ten? - Yes. At ten. Everything had better go smoothly. By the way... What's your plan for this? You have to stall them. Well, it's like, we'll be there, waiting for those two to show up, and... I'll have rope. What rope? To tie them up, if they try to run. Look, do whatever you want. Just keep the kids away. Where will the thieves actually be? Kid, mind your own business. Who is it? It's me. What's the matter? I'm sick. Tomo... I have a confession to make. I know. You told Ivo. How do you know that? Doesn't matter. But, Tomo, I never thought he'd work against you guys. - I just heard him with Blackie. - I know. - That too. - And you just lie there? You are clueless. - Tomo! - You don't get it. I hope you realize you're the biggest coward ever! I'm not. Go away! Look, Tomo, the boys should really know. You tell them. You're good at it! Tomo, I know you're not a coward. - Are you ready? - We are. - We have the rope? - We do. We hide here and wait. They have to pass this way. Shh! Did you guys hear that? What's that? What are you doing here? She's with me. What, your girlfriend changed your diaper, so you came? No. She just gave me this. What's that? A bandanna. So we don't have to listen to your pathetic lies. What are you doing? Guys, we have to go. Someone will find you by morning. Traitor! Good luck, Emica. You too, boys. Come on' hurry up. Come on. Get a move on. Come on. - Tomo... - I know. - What? - Shh. Come on. Hands up! Police! Turn them off! Kids? This is your problem now. Come on, get out. I won't hurt you. Watch out. Surrender! Police are on their way! I'll get you before! Come on, get off. Get off! What now, kids, eh? Who's going to help you? Eh? Who's going to help you? Give my gun back! You failed at your task! Stop, I'll shoot! Shoot, then! Go on, shoot, then. You know it's broken. It's always been broken. You murderer! I didn't mean to! You murdered my dog. He was supposed to wake up and be okay! Well, he wasn't okay! He never woke up! I'm really sorry. Guys. Where's Tomo? Tomo! - Tomo! - Tomo! Tomo! Stop! Stop! Dad! Stop! Dad? Forgive me, son. Ivo got in debt. With a loan shark. The man threatened him. He told me loo late, and I, I had to do something about it. You should have told us. The whole village would've helped. I know. But it's too late now. Dad the police are on their way. - You made the call? - Yes, yes, yes, we did. My Emica told us things. But we thought she was making them up. But she kept insisting, and finally... - Take care of Mom, Tomo. - We called you straight away. You did well ma'am You see he was changing his tire when we found him, so... Tomo, how are you doing? Look, Tomo... We've been chasing him for over a year. He's been terrorizing Zagreb. I know it's not much of a consolation... but your brother was just the latest victim of his extortion. We were afraid you wouldn't come. So young yet so distrustful, eh? You guys don't trust the police eh? All right, all right, you did great. And when do we get the reward? What reward? Well, the reward. Koko! And the real policemen actually came? The realest! They had both cuffs and guns. Boys, that was well-planned. I must admit, it would've been far harder without your help. I think it would've been impossible without my help. Apparently girls aren't so evil after all. What did you think? But Tomo was still the bravest. Kissy, Kissy! Come on. - Hey, if Bozo didn't trip and fall... - The entire bust would be busted. Well, I think the key thing is that we got the "reward." I had to motivate you somehow, guys. Hi! Everybody. I'm sorry. You'd better be. Go on, come here. Koko, Marcia. What are you doing here? We have a problem. What problem, Daddy? Neda? Someone has to take care of this dog. I will! Tsar! His name will be Tsar! Go on, Tsar. Go on. Aw, he's such a little cutie. He's got a really cute tail. Well, I still have my pigeons at least. He's very cute.
