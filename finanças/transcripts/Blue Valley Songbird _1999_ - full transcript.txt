THEN GO FOR A WALK. REARRANGE THE FURNITURE. HANK, YOU'RE NOT LISTENING TO ME. LAST NIGHT'S THE FIRST TIME I'VE EVER WALKED OUT ON A SHOW. WELL, THANK GOD YOU GOT YOUR PRIORITIES STRAIGHT! I THOUGHT LAST NIGHT WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT YOU SLEPT WITH ANOTHER MAN! IT TURNS OUT IT WAS JUST A LITTLE CAREER CRISIS. IT'S NOT MY CAREER! IT'S MY LIFE! WELL, IT IS MINE, TOO. AND 15 YEARS OF IT HAS BEEN DEDICATED TO YOU! WHEN I FIRST MET YOU, YOU WERE A FLAKE. YOU COULDN'T HAVE GOTTEN A GIG AT A FIRE DEPARTMENT PICNIC IF YOUR HAIR WAS IN FLAMES! YOU WERE ON A FAST TRACK TO NOWHERE, READY TO CRASH AND BURN! AND I FIXED IT! I FIXED IT, DAMN IT! I FIXED IT SO YOU NEVER HAD TO DO ANYTHING BUT WRITE YOUR SONGS AND SING THEM. I DID THAT FOR YOU! WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT? JEEZ! SOMETHING TO HOPE FOR. I GOTTA HAVE A SHOT AT SOMETHING BETTER! I JUST HAVE TO! LEANNA, THE GRASS IS ALWAYS GREENER. WELL, MAYBE! BUT I HAVE TO KNOW! I'VE GOT TO REACH FOR SOMETHING HIGHER! I'VE GOT TO, HANK! OR I'M GONNA REACH FOR THE DOOR! WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO? SIT ON MY HANDS WHILE YOU THROW YOURSELF AT SOME GUITAR PLAYER? NO.

IF THAT'S WHAT IT TAKES, I'LL CALL HIM. GOOD. I'VE KNOWN PETER McNALLY FOREVER -- WAY BEFORE YOU STARTED WORKING WITH LEANNA. HE HAS THIS PHRASE HE LIKES TO JOKE ABOUT -- &quot;SNAKE ALERT.&quot; WHEN HE WORKED HERE 15 YEARS AGO, HE SAW LOTS OF TALENT COME THROUGH. PROBLEM WAS, MOST OF THEM HAD SNAKES IN THEIR HEADS -- HIS WORDS. PETER HAS AN AVERSION TO SNAKES. AND HE CAN SPOT ONE IN 10 SECONDS FLAT. THIS CONROY GUY -- DOES HE CARRY ANY WEIGHT WITH McNALLY? SHOOT, LEANNA DOESN'T NEED CONROY TO GET TO McNALLY. WHY DON'T YOU JUST STAY OUT OF IT AND LET NATURE TAKE ITS COURSE. SHE DOESN'T WANT ME TO STAY OUT OF IT. Franklin: FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH, THE WAY I SEE IT, A FILLY GETS SPOOKED, A MAN'S GOT TO HANG ON, LET HER RUN. THAT HAPPENED TO AN UNCLE OF MINE ONCE. HE GOT KNOCKED OFF BY A TREE BRANCH -- KILLED HIM. WELL, THAT TOO. YEP. [ COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYS ] I thought you told him to make an appointment. He insisted on waiting. He said he knew you -- Mr. Hatcher. [ SIGHS ] HANK! OH, HEY, PETER.

THING IS, ONE OF YOUR FELLOWS HAS BEEN GIVING ME A PROBLEM. REALLY? WHO? A GUY BY THE NAME OF JOHN CONROY. HE'S BEEN SNIFFING AROUND LEANNA, MAKING ALL THESE BIG PROMISES. FRANKLY IT'S GOT HER ALL DISTRACTED. IS SHE STILL A HANDFUL? WELL, SHE'S STILL HANGING IN THERE. WE GOT A LOT OF SOLID BOOKINGS. IT AIN'T NOTHIN' LIKE THE BIG TIME, BUT WE'RE GETTIN' BY. SHOULD I BE PAYING ATTENTION? WELL, I'D GIVE UP MY RIGHT ARM FOR LEANNA, -BUT LORD KNOWS SHE CAN BE A PROBLEM. -STILL? JUST THE OTHER NIGHT, SHE WALKED OUT ON THE SHOW. I MEAN, RIGHT OUT OF THE BLUE, JUST UP AND LEFT BEFORE THE THIRD SET. LOOK, I KNOW CONROY CAN GET EXCITED. I'LL TALK TO HIM, OKAY? I APPRECIATE THAT. HEY, IT WAS GOOD SEEIN' YOU. IF YOU SEE RUBY, TELL HER I SAID, &quot;HEY.&quot; AND TELL HER IF SHE'S ON THIS SIDE OF THE RIVER, SHE'D BETTER COME AND SEE ME. I'LL DO THAT. THANK YOU SO MUCH.

AND, WELL, ABOUT THE BAND -- YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT ME THERE. WHAT I REALLY NEED RIGHT NOW IS TO SEE YOU. I'm not sure how -- TO MEET ON SATURDAY. HANK'S GOING TO BE WATCHING THE BALLGAME AT MELON'S, and I'll be at the Candlelight. I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT COULD HAPPEN. JUST SAY YOU'LL COME, PLEASE. THAT'S ALL I NEED RIGHT NOW. I DON'T KNOW, BOBBY. [ TELEPHONE BEEPS ] [ Dial tone ] THAT'S ENOUGH FOR NOW. I'M GLAD YOU CAME, HANK. YOU KNOW, I USED TO WANT TO BE A SINGER. REALLY? I'VE NEVER HEARD YOU SING. I CAN'T.

ANY BUSINESS YOU GOT WITH HANK, YOU GOT WITH ME. HANK SHOULDN'T HAVE GOTTEN IN THE MIDDLE OF IT IF HE HAD TOLD ME ABOUT YOUR HISTORY WITH McNALLY, I COULD HAVE FINESSED THINGS. AS IT IS YOU WANT HIM TO HEAR YOU NOW, YOU BETTER PRAY FOR DIVINE INTERVENTION. WHAT ARE YOU TALKIN' ABOUT?! WHAT DID HANK DO? ASK HIM. HE'S THE ONE WHO MESSED IT UP. DAMN HIM! HANK STILL AT MELON'S? WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST TELL ME YOU WEREN'T GONNA COME? I WANTED TO. I COULDN'T. THE OTHER NIGHT, I CROSSED A LINE I WOULDN'T HAVE CROSSED UNLESS I THOUGHT YOU WANTED ME TO. I SHOULDN'T HAVE COME THERE.
