PALERMO, 29 JULY 1983 ARREST WARRANT PALERMO COURTHOUSE CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS OFFICE EXAMINING MAGISTRATE ROCCO CHINNICI Kids, get away from there! Come on! Rocco. Well, I am going. The bus is leaving soon. -Yes. -See you this evening. I don't know what time I'll be back because we have lots of exams. Can you call Caterina to find out how she is? -Don't worry. I'll take care of it. -All right. -Bye. -Bye. Tina. Have a good day. REMOVALS Giovanni! Giovanni, come on! You have been in the bathroom for half an hour! -What's going on? -Dad, I am late. You always say that, and then you're on time. Come on! Hi, Dad. -Hurry, Giovanni. -Finally. Dad, wait for me. I'll go with you. I'm meeting a colleague, he's helping me with my thesis. -Yes, but hurry up. -All right. Paparcuri, I left the transceiver in the escort car. -Go and bring it to the armored car. -I'm on it. Hello? Hi! Yes, I am about to leave. You'll pick me up? All right, bye. My colleague will pick me up. Sorry, Dad. Bye. -Bye. -Bye. Car two, go forward. There's traffic in the internal lane. Once the emergency is over, we can pass. Hello? No, Rocco, no. Dad? SAN CIRO (TRAPANI) Do you really want to stay here alone? Yes. Yes, I am sure. It helps me get through the pain. This place has always been special to you. If I accept the head D.A.'s proposal, our life will change, Manlio. I know. It's… It's a difficult decision. I will have to be escorted for my whole life, like Dad. Take all the time you need. And when we have children? They will be in the same situation that I was in, for years. Caterina. Whatever you decide… I will always be with you. I am sure you will make the right choice. Caterina, there are only three good professions in the world. SAN CIRO, MAY 1972 Doctor. Magistrate, and teacher. And it's not by chance that I married a teacher. And I, a magistrate. But if I can give you some advice, become a teacher. That way you can dedicate more time to your family. There is time. One thing at a time. Now let's think about the diploma. -All right? -Thank you, Dad. Actually, will you help me go over my Greek tonight? That too? Caterina, will you help me finish the drawing? I'm coming. Caterina! "Make a weak argument a strong one." She doesn't need help. Tina. Thank you. There's a party at my house tomorrow. You better show up. -I don't know if I can. -"I don't know if I can"? I won't have the party if you don't come. Wait. My father is here. -So what? -He doesn’t want me to ride motorbikes. But you're 18 years old. You're still living under his rule? Caterina! Come. Let's not make Mom wait. That boy doesn't go to the high school. His name is Salvatore Russo. He's in his first year of architecture. I've known him for a week. He's a good boy. He's throwing a party tomorrow evening. -And you can't go. -Why not? Because it is not a good idea. And I don't want you riding on a motorbike. I've told you that many times. -Good evening, miss. -Mr. Russo. -You show up at this hour? -I was only able to come now. I was gonna go looking for you. You know that? -I have to go back home early. -What time? -At 11:00. -At 11:00? -The party begins at 11:00. -My dad doesn't want me to stay out late. Always your father. I'll take you back home. Did you see who Salvatore brought tonight? The judge's daughter. I saw that. Thank you, Salvatore. It was very nice of you. -Stay a while longer. -I can't, really. -Bye. -Bye, Cinderella. Angela! Stop. -Angela, please, stop! -Dad, you are a real bore! -Where are you going at this time, Angela? -Leave me alone. Go, go. Caterina, do you know where they are going? -Do you know him? -No, I'm sorry. UNIVERSITY OF PALERMO LAW DEGREE ARREST WARRANT -Good morning. -Good morning, Dad. Did you sleep well? -Look here. -I am a bit worried. About what? I am afraid I'm not ready for the Italian test. Come on! At your age I thought the diploma exams were an unsurmountable mountain. Then slowly, they became a hill. Don't worry. But remember to keep your notebooks in order. Good morning. Giovanni doesn't want to go to school today but won't tell me the reason. -Maybe he'll talk to you. -What happened? Why? I am angry because they offended you yesterday. Me? Why? Andrea's big brother said you don't leave decent people alone, and that you'll end up in a bad way. -Why is he upset with you? -You shouldn't listen to them. It is normal that some people don't like the work your father does, right? Dad is like a referee. Do you like referees? Right! But they are necessary… or games couldn't be played on Sunday. -But you never go to the stadium. -I never go. The city is my stadium. That is where I expel, give out yellow and red cards. If people argue, I try to understand who is right and who is wrong. If there are problems, what does a referee do? He whistles. And Dad whistles. You must not worry. Go to school. PALERMO COURTHOUSE You don't remember? You don't remember that you own 28 buildings. Twenty-eight. Here. These are the cadastral certificates. Well, yes, that is my name on it. It is. You were a porter at the station. -Yes. -And then what happened? Did money fall from the sky? I won the lottery, sir. The lottery. -All lucky winners in Palermo. -All of them. Did you keep the receipt? I don't think so. -But I can look for it. -That's good. Look for it. Attorney, tell your client that if the win isn't proven, I must investigate him for money laundering. All right? Shall we meet here tomorrow morning at 9:00? -At your disposal. -With or without the receipt. -Very well. -All right. Let's go. -Goodbye. See you tomorrow. -My respects. See you tomorrow. Vice Police Chief, Colonel. Please, come in. Here. Bring me your report, once finished. That 80-year-old gentleman you met up with, is the fifth forgetful person I've questioned since yesterday. People who don't earn anything and casually own half of Palermo. These are just hypotheses I'm taking the liberty to share. Actually, the procedure states that we are to decide which direction investigations must take. I just have suggestions, let me make that very clear. We'll gladly listen to you. All right. So… Here. This area of the city, built in recent years, often not conforming to urban planning norms, is the outcome of considerable assets laundered with real estate, not least thanks to our forgetful friends. An incredible flow of… of money. Of money that becomes blood, because it comes from heroin. Its sale is in continuous growth. Of course. Yes. And naturally, behind it, there is the Mafia. I know very well that in certain circles of our city, that word must never even be said. Isn't that true? They prefer to call it "crime." I would say that "organized crime" equals "Mafia." And behind all this… there is this gentleman here. Stefano Bontate. He calls himself "The Prince of Villagrazia" even though he's not a noble. Bontate is very well known in the city. He is a member of the well-to-do in Palermo. He is a very powerful man. Nobody has ever investigated a man like him. And we will. That is, if you agree. We'll investigate him and… And the gentlemen who work for him. The Russo brothers. Just suggestions, of course. PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOL "G.B. VICO" Angela, you didn't come to school today. Listen, Caterina. I haven't been getting along with my folks lately. I wanted to ask you, could you lend me some money? I'll return it as soon as I can. Of course! -Sure. -Thank you. Watch out, our professors could see you. Who cares! -What problems do you have at home? -The usual. -The same things. -Wait. You're leaving already? Let's take a walk. Okay? We haven't seen each other in a long time. It's true. Come on. It's so lovely here. It doesn't even seem like we're in Palermo. I come here often. It's my secret refuge. Remember when they took us here to play, as little girls? Yes. But when you leave, you are faced with this disgusting city. Actually, I like it. You liked it too. Because I didn't realize. As soon as school is over, I am leaving. I want to stay here to study though. Sure, stay here. Stay here. Get married, have children. Go hibernate, Caterina! Angela, why are you treating me like this? Did I do something that I've forgotten? I'm sorry, it's not you. Sorry. Is it about the boy I saw the other night? The one with the motorbike, you ran away from your dad with him. Oh, no. No, he is just a friend. I met him in the square. This summer we're going to India, on a motorbike. -Really? -Yes. He is the only person who understands me. I can't stand anyone else anymore. My family… suffocate me. I don't feel… -I need to feel free. Understand? -That's normal. I sometimes have problems at home too. Caterina, are you here? -Hi, Salvatore. -What a handsome boy. Don't misunderstand. -No, stay. -Go, Caterina. Dad. -Hi. -Hi. I heard on the radio what the exam topics are. Which ones did you choose? Carlo Cattaneo and his concept of the United States of Europe. Dad, I think I did well. But one step at a time. I'm sure you did well. Listen, Caterina. I must tell you something. This morning they arrested several heroin dealers. They were the father and uncle of that Salvatore, the boy I saw you with. Now do you see why I didn't want you to go to the Russo's home? You could have told me. No, I can't reveal anything that deals with my work. Not even to your daughter? In fact, I can't overlook the possibility that this could be a way to get at me. I don't think so. Salvatore has nothing to do with his family's guilt. Who said that? Even though I think everything's for a reason in a family like that. -Listen, Dad. -What is it? I went to that party. I even saw Salvatore again. Nothing happened if that's what you want to know. We just went out a couple of times. -You shouldn't have. -I couldn't have known. Caterina, this city is teeming with Mafia. In this city, things are never what they seem. You must think twice about what you say and twice about what you do. -Remember that. -One can make a mistake. No, you can't. Anyway, if you do, at least don't repeat it. Caterina! Caterina, did you see Angela? She must be in class doing her essay, right? No, she's not there. She didn't show up. You were right, Rocco, to tell us to watch out for drugs. Drugs? Caterina, can you think where she could have gone? Angela? Angela? Angela. Angela. Angela. Angi. Angela, no. Dad. No. HIGH SCHOOL G.B. VICO Angela was one of the most intelligent girls I'd ever met. I wouldn't say so, considering what happened to her. She asked for it. Did she? Maybe the drugs looked for her. Or not? Angela was a girl like you. The same fragility, the same needs. She thought that she could overcome this with drugs. Or at least it's what the heroin dealers had her believe. Mafia. Mafia! Mafia. -But what's Mafia got to do with it? -What's Mafia got to do with it? It makes enormous amounts of money on your hides. Why? Does someone here think that Mafia men are men of honor? Look, this is just a rumor that they spread around. Mafia men are cowards. And murderers. And pushing drugs is a crime against humanity. Learn to think with your own heads. Because, you see, ideas, words, culture, can help change the world. -The world? -But we are just kids. And I believe in you kids. I believe in your fragility, but also in your transparency. And in your conscience. Because in you young people, moral stimuli are higher, and dramatically more real. Protect your life. -Because we magistrates, alone, cannot. -Are you asking us all to become spies? I am asking you not to give in to resignation or silence. I realize that being silent means being afraid for one's life. "Silence," another word. But what is a life that gives in to oppression? Raise your heads. And try to make your existence awesome. And try… to do this. Dad. Dad. I know what my profession's going to be. I want to become a magistrate. PALERMO, 1979 -Good morning. -Good morning. Miss, are you lost? Do you need help? I know the way. I am Caterina Chinnici, the new trainee. Chinnici's daughter. -May I accompany you? -No, thank you. You see? Goodness graciousness has arrived! We already have justice. Dad, may I finally know who I'll be working with? Surprise. Everybody is summoned for coffee, downstairs in ten minutes. Now that the moment has come, I have a lot of doubts. I will be dealing with monsters like Bontate and Inzerillo. What if I can't make it? -You will be a good magistrate. -You say that because I'm your daughter. No. I'm saying that because you are independent, you have profound judgement. You are also more obstinate than I am. Come in. Judge Borsellino. -Caterina! -May I introduce Miss Chinnici. Paolo! Now I see why they call it "The Poison Building." Let's say I contribute the best I can. Mr. Borsellino, could Miss Chinnici, if you think it is a good idea, do her apprenticeship in your office? -Mr. Chinnici, what can I say? -What can you say? Considering the office acts, since nothing prevents your request, my answer can only be affirmative. -Welcome, Caterina. -Have a good day. What a pleasure! So! -Where shall we begin? -Let's arrest all of them. Let's take a photo. -Oh, yes. -Yes. Dad, take off your glasses. Smile. SAN CIRO, JUNE 1979 I've decided. I'll go back to being a magistrate here in Palermo. You're leaving the Anti-Mafia Parliamentary Commission? I will be more useful here. -I'll be glad if you come back, Cesare. -Me too. Especially now that Bontate is free again. He became an ally of the Totò Inzerillo clan. I brought some water. -Thank you, Caterina. -Thank you. They are… the heroin refinery of all of Europe. May I stay? -Yes, you're a magistrate too. -Thank you, Mr. Terranova. We can't even imagine… the amount of money they manage to produce. Yes, and not only that. Totò Inzerillo is a relative of the Gambino clan in Brooklyn. He is first cousin of John Gambino. And so they are tied by the strongest of all bonds. Blood. Imagine! Do you realize how much we can benefit from exchanging such important information in this way, in the country? It is the first time we've talked together about our investigations. Never before. And now we are doing so. Actually, as of tomorrow, we'll work on this hypothesis. Meaning the heroin can be sold not only in Europe, but also in America. And from there, the profit returns to Bontate and his cousin Inzerillo. And not just to them. What is it, Cesare? You can't tell us? The Anti-Mafia Commission hasn't made it official yet, but that is the main reason why I am returning. The "Palermitani" are not the only ones in command. Now there are also the "Corleonesi," "the peasants" as they are called. -Will they command together? -For the time being. I know the Corleonesi. They are very different from the Palermitani, but just as dangerous. They are led by Salvatore Riina. -"Totò, 'u curtu." -For a long time-- He's been a fugitive for a long time, and he’s guilty of many crimes. Do you realize we must find this out from Rome? And how does Bontate fit in all this? Right now, he's the one leading the game. He's protected by freemasons and politics. CHINNICI -Good evening, sir. -Good evening. -Hi, Cate. I think I am early. -Don't worry. I'm ready. I just have to get my purse. This is Vincenzo. I met him Sunday during dinner. -Vincenzo, my pleasure. -My pleasure. -Would you like a coffee? -Oh, yes. -We'll only take a minute. -So will we. Will you bring it to the studio? Can you bring a couple of cookies too? Why must he always question everyone? Caterina's going to the movies with him, she's doesn't have to marry him. He wants to know what sort of boy he is. You know what your father's like. All right, Mom, but none of our girlfriends undergo scrutiny like that. None of your girlfriends' father is a judge. Caterina is older than you, and I don't think she's making such a fuss. -Because she's the good one. -That's not true. Yes, whatever Dad does, it's fine with you. It's that I understand why he's doing it. And I don't want to make things tougher for him than they already are. He is a good boy. You can go out with him. -A wee bit boring, though. -I don't think so. Be home by 11:00. -But I am a magistrate now. -Magistrate and my daughter. All right? Be home by 11:00. You see? Stop laughing. Confirmation arrived from the American police. John Gambino. Pushes heroin on the entire East Coast. Now even the Americans have realized that it all comes from here. Inzerillo… Bontate… American coast… NYC POLICE 417073 And Mr. Gambino. A worldwide business. In Palermo alone there must be at least 3,000 heroin addicts. It is a huge massacre. It is. We should strike them there, in their finance movements. There. We don't have the right legislative instruments. You know that, Rocco. -We have the laws. -If only we had them! Come in. -Good morning all. -Good morning. Miss Chinnici, you get more and more beautiful! -Barra, good morning. How's it going? -Very well. And you? Always at work. The first to arrive and the last to leave. -To each their own. -I'm giving you a delicate investigation. Real estate abuse. We've been following them for months at the D.A. Office. But I believe it's no big deal. You'll see for yourselves. Town Hall councilors are involved, and they're decent people. We must be careful not to make mistakes. It's all the journalists are waiting for. Of course, sure. I'm organizing a tennis tournament. We, the D.A., against you, the examining magistrates. -If you agree, it would be an honor. -No, no. Thank you. -And you, Rocco? -Oh, no! Just boxing for me. -But on television. -Come on! Have a good day. Miss Chinnici. -Goodbye. -Goodbye. Do you understand now, Caterina? It's a way of pressuring us. -The reference to the journalists? -Yes. Keep calm, go to the beach. There are three types of colleagues. Those who are often absent. Those who just care about getting by. And those who collude. Colluding tennis players. And you live like this, Dad? With locks and men like him? You never told us about this at home. You get used to it. Don't tell these things to Mom. Who knows what she'll imagine? All right? Don't. In fact, come with me. I want you to meet one of the few people you can trust. Come. D.A. Head Gaetano Costa is one of the few allies we have in this building. Remember that. He is a man of rigor, and, for this reason, isolated. He comes from Caltanissetta. He was a Partisan. I assure you that in certain circles, that is not appreciated. Mr. Chinnici, did you think it's over? Want to play in this tennis tournament? -They say you serve very well. -Yeah! But even someone like Barra works with him? Costa just arrived. He didn't have time to choose his collaborators. CHIEF PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE -Am I disturbing you? -Come in. -May I introduce my daughter? -Finally. Miss Chinnici, welcome. -My pleasure. -D.A. Head Gaetano Costa. Please, sit down. Smoke, and more smoke. -I have only heard good things about you. -Thank you. -I was about to come look for you. -About the new investigation? No. You head that one now. No, about Terranova. Did you hear that he could become head of the examining magistrates? I know! Cesare mentioned it personally. He said the High Council is giving him a really hard time. I hope Terranova will make it. With him, D.A. and the Examining Office could give each other a hand. Cesare doesn't heed anyone. I don't think we could ask for a better head man. -Right? Don't you agree? -Yes. He was the first to put pen on paper, and state that the two ex-Palermo mayors colluded with the Mafia. 25 SEPTEMBER 1979 A new, disturbing murder has been added to the long chain of crimes that spread blood in our city. Cesare Terranova, magistrate and deputy, elected twice for Parliament, one of the biggest experts of the Mafia phenomenon, was barbarously killed. Marshal Lenin Mancuso, who was assigned to protect the judge, was also killed. The magistrate leaves his wife, while Mancuso leaves his wife and also four children. From Palermo, the coverage from our studio. As every morning, shortly after 8:00, Marshal Mancuso went by Terranova's home to pick him up and take him to the Justice Building. The judge sat in the driver's seat, and Mancuso sat next to him. They reached a secondary street that was blocked by road works. It was a trap. Terranova realized it immediately and put the gear into reverse… They've never struck so high. I just talked to the chief of police. It seems that the murder was committed by the Corleonesi. They wanted to kill an enemy that knew a lot about them. And to show that they could rule Palermo. Now we must see what Bontate and Inzerillo will do. They must want to show that they are still the rulers of Palermo. We are still alive. It's the High Council of the Judiciary. They are proposing that I become Examining Office head. The position that Terranova was to take over. Yes. They are giving me 24 hours to decide. An ultimatum. They didn't kill Cesare because he headed the Examining Office… but because he was an Anti-Mafia man. A bothersome magistrate. Why? Are you not bothersome to the Mafia? Don't know… I wouldn't be doing a job that is so different from what I've done until now. That is not so. That is not so. That is no longer so. With the murder of Cesare, they have gone beyond the limit. You know that. And now everything will be different. Remember how happy we were when you were D.A. in Partanna, at the beginning of your career? Yes, but it was… It was another Sicily, another time. What is this country becoming? Mom, Dad. -Come, Caterina. -May I? -Yes, come. -What is it? You can't sleep? No, I can't. We were talking about Partanna. -We lived so well there. -What is this? A nostalgia evening? Can't you ask for more time before deciding? No. Think about it. Promise me you'll think about it. EXAMINING MAGISTRATE ROCCO CHINNICI We must catch all of Cesare's murderers. And if the Mafia has changed strategy, so must we. We'll no longer limit ourselves to just evaluating the proof put on our table. No, we ourselves will give impulse to the investigations. Because a magistrate… Because a magistrate has a wider view. But this is something that we have never done before. -Investigations are for the police force. -And now we'll do them too. Our new weapon will be specialization. I will assign Mafia trials to each of you. Always to the same, so that we create a close-knit, expert group. A pool. Remember that talk we had… at San Ciro, with Cesare? Of course I remember. It is one of the last times we saw him alive. But do you remember how important it was to share all that information? None of us must continue to work in solitude. Councilor, this mortifies the very nature of a magistrate. No, on the contrary. It highlights it. Because the work of an individual would be part of the group work. I agree. Rocco is right. I think that together we can be stronger. How do we know? We've never done it. Even you said that. Think it over, carefully. When a magistrate is killed… all his work, his contacts, his know-how, die with him. We, on the other hand, will share everything. And if one of us… Someone else can continue the investigation. That is how it will be. I will work alongside you. I will support you. I will be… How can I say it? A father. That is if Caterina doesn't get jealous. Wait. I want people like you to work on the investigations. The truth? I would have been offended if you hadn't asked. I am also thinking of an old friend of yours. The best in analyzing accounts. You guessed it, right? -Have a good day. -Have a good day. Rocco, I actually deal with cases that drag on and on with sentences that are never definitive. -And last for decades. -Giovanni, I've always imagined that the bankruptcy sector was a bit tight for you and that you're more attracted to the penal sector. It is a waste of intelligence. A man like you, with such profound know-how of financial mechanisms. Come on! Why don't you come to the Examining Office? Yes. -But I must submit a request. -I've already done it. You didn't even tell me? To speed things up. You know what they're like at the High Council. Anyway, if you don't agree, we can block everything. It is what you wanted, Giovanni. This is a one-off chance. They told me you always decide everything. Yeah! We must launch the financial investigations in all directions. Without any leniency for anyone. -We should stick our noses into banks? -Exactly, yes. -All hell will break loose. -It's what we want to happen. -I brought some coffee. -Good girl. Thank you. Well… how long will it take the High Council of the Judiciary to say yes? Caterina! Hey! I knew we would find you here. We can't keep away from this place either. It has been too important. Where is Manlio? Manlio was with me but I asked him to leave me alone. Are we a bother? Oh, no. Now that you're here, you must stay. I was thinking of staying one or two days. Me too. -I wanted to straighten it up a bit. -I have already begun doing so. -Giovanni, get the bags from the car. -All right. I'll go right away. -Well? How did the trip go? -Fine. We managed to arrive. But… are you sure you wouldn't rather be by yourself? Of course not. Don't worry. I am glad that you are staying. Look, isn't it beautiful? I am sure that being together will give us strength. To me… this place has the power to calm me. It makes me feel good too. PALERMO, 1980 -Do you know what time it is? -Half past midnight. I didn't know the movie would end at this time. I decided to stay. -You made me worry. -I'm sorry, Dad. I'm sick of abiding by the rule of returning home at 11. -And of you controlling me. -Lower your voice! I don't have a boyfriend because you always have to question everyone. Did you hear how she spoke to me? Not so loud, Rocco. Calm down. It's normal. -Normal? What's normal? -Lower your voice. It's normal that she needs freedom. Ever since she was a girl, she's tried to please us, especially you. And it's my fault she can't find a boyfriend when there are all these boys around, and she's beautiful? Come on! Are you sure it's like that? Sure? -You're saying she's right? -Rocco, please. Think it over. -Now let's go to sleep. -Who can sleep now? That'll do. She is back. Dad. Sorry I spoke to you like that. I know you're worried, but you should still understand. No, I'm the one who must apologize. I'm the one who must understand. Have your coffee, or it will get cold. Yes, it's the account of one of our clients. You should let Mr. Falcone have a history of all activity on this account. No, you can't ask me for that. It's a bank secret. Listen, you can do as you wish. But I must inform you that for abetment there is a prison sentence of four years. What do you want to know? FEBRUARY 1980 Look, Caterina. They are so arrogant and so sure of themselves that they don't even worry about leaving behind traces. The signature on each check can tell us about a big illicit network. Listen, last February you received a deposit of 220 million lire. -For what reason? -It was the restitution of a loan. But there's something strange. On that same day, you subdivided that 220 million into a series of bearers' booklets. Which were in turn forwarded to the accounts of Inzerillo and Bontate. How do you explain that? Do you understand the question? You have a lovely family. Hello? Judge Chinnici. This is Attorney-at-law Messina. You're working too much, Judge. It's bad for your health. You should take it easy and relax more. Take a nice vacation with your family. I wouldn't want anything to happen to you. Like it did to the other judge, your friend. -Rocco. -Yes? -What did they want? -Nothing. It was a wrong number. -You see, Mom? I was right. -Yes, you did a good job. Wait, I'll go open it. -Rocco, who is it? -Don't worry. -Good morning, Councilor. -Good morning, Maresciallo. Marshal Trapassi and Lance Corporal Bartolotta. As of today, I'll have the honor of having them as my bodyguards. As of tomorrow, wait for me downstairs. -Orders are to come to your door. -I'll talk to the commander. But as of today, you must follow procedure. Don't stop at windows, or on the balcony. -And you must not use your car. -But… -What'll we do about the game tomorrow? -We'll sort it out. Don't worry. -Councilor, please. -There are precautions for you too. At night don't come home by car alone. Drive around the building. Check that there are no parked cars with people on board. -That means every time we go out-- -Yes. And if there should be any suspicious persons, remain in your car and don't go to the front door. Then look for a phone and call the station. We'll take care of it. -Shall we go? It's a bit late. -Yes. -Goodbye. -Goodbye. Don't worry. We'll talk about it tonight. I hadn't realized that Dad was in so much danger. Love, Dad knows what he's doing. And his strength also comes from us. If we are strong, he will be too. Do we agree on that? Come on. Finish getting ready. Come with me, follow me. I am quite certain-- Come with me. I am certain that people are spying on me. This is the only place where I can speak in peace. I am waiting for the results of a very, very important investigation. And you're worried because they haven't arrived? Exactly. The Mobile squad is about to incriminate some big builders. All unsuspected men who've manipulated contracts for great public works. And from them, I can trace the politicians that used them. But evidence is needed, Gaetano. In Palermo, everyone knows local politicians collude with the Mafia. Do you know the difference between us and Piersanti Mattarella? It's that Piersanti Mattarella could say these things, and in some way, he did. That is why they killed him. But for us to say them, we need evidence. He personally asked me to deal with this investigation. Rocco, we must be careful now, and act together, in parallel. Yes, we must be careful. -But we must hurry. -You can count on it. I even postponed my holiday to wait for this investigation. Today, four days after the massacre of the Bologna station, inside the Basilica of Piazza Maggiore, in the presence of the President of the Republic, Sandro Pertini, and all the civil and ecclesiastic authorities, the funeral of seven of the eighty victims took place. Archbishop Zuppi went there, with his thoughts and prayers for those who survived and suffer in body and spirit over the loss of loved ones. Hello? At the end of the liturgical ritual, Cardinal Poma… No! No! Please step back. Don't come close. Stop! Stop. Back up. Back up! Stay back. 06 AUGUST 1980 Move back. -Move back! -Please! -Move. -Have some respect! -Don't come close. -You must stay back! Please! -Stay back. -Let him pass! -Excuse me. -Go away. Councilor. Keep back. Mr. Costa had stopped at a stall to look for a book. He was hit in the back with a .38 caliber. The request Gaetano was waiting for has disappeared. We don't know what happened to it. He was left by himself. And in Palermo, anyone who is alone dies. Rocco, everyone is afraid here. I heard that someone in our office will ask for a transfer. I fear only a few of us will remain. Are you worried about Caterina? When I encouraged her to enter the magistrate selection… I never expected a war to break out. This is a war where people only die on one side. Caterina is tough, like you. She wouldn't leave, even if I asked her. What more do you need, Rocco, before you realize you've become a target? I married of man of law. And I find myself with a man at the front, as if he were at war. We must face this together, Rocco. Why don't you think about a transfer? We'll leave Palermo. Promise me you'll think about it, now that we're going to San Ciro. Please. You can't go to the window, Rocco. They said you can't stay there. Kids. We must help Dad decide whether to stay in Palermo… or leave. Leave for where, Mom? Maybe there's a position at the Turin D.A. Office. How can I just start somewhere else? It is not easy. It isn't easy for me, either. I understand, but I am not asking you that now. We must not only think of ourselves. We must think of Dad too. And this could be a way… to get him away from this risky situation. He could be freer, and not have bodyguards anymore. What does he say? He's not saying anything for the time being. But maybe if we all ask him together… Rocco, I spoke to the kids. They would be willing to leave. Of course it will be hard to give up this sea and San Ciro. But if it's necessary, we will. But we know that the decision is up to you. Palermo is our city. This is our life. Can you see me in the northern fog? No, I'd say no. We should have asked him to leave. Everything would have been different. I know. I always think of that too. But we would never have convinced him. Dad led the life he wanted. One as a free man. Until the end. Caterina, what's the matter? You didn't only come here to remember Dad. Isn't that right? Now I know how Dad felt. The D.A. chief proposed that I follow a Mafia investigation. Caterina. He gave me some time to decide. He understands the situation I'm in. But I must give him an answer. What do you plan to do? I don't know. Dad! Come for a swim! It's beautiful! Come on, Rocco! You'll get sunstroke. At least take your jacket off. SAN CIRO, APRIL 1981 POLICE Councilor. -Good morning. -Good morning. Stefano Bontate was just killed. And for the first time, military submachine guns were used. War weapons. They've raised the stakes. Out of spite, they killed him on the day of his birthday. It's a clear signal… it means a new Mafia war. Salvatore Riina. He doesn't want to share the cake with the Palermitani. And now the Palermitani will answer. There will be more deaths. Excuse me. Can we at least open this a crack? No. Are you kidding? The police want to put in bullet-proof glass. But of course, to have a fan, we must send a request to Rome. Mirello, go see if you can find another one later. All right? Let's begin with what we have. All right? These are the photos we had taken at Stefano Bontate's funeral. Here. Excuse me. Who are these two? They are Nino and Ignazio Salvo. Two entrepreneurs tied to the Democratic Christian Party. They are cousins. And for the past 20 years, since they received the contract for tax collection in Sicily, they have become the bosses of Palermo. They are powerful and have good connections. And not only that. They have received enormous amounts of European contribution for agriculture, thanks to their political friends in Palermo, in Rome. Excuse me. But for a non-Sicilian, it is not easy to get oriented. Poor Costa was looking for a trait d'union between Mafia and politics. And the Salvos are a highway. Did they have to send us someone from the continent, as backup? Beggars can't be choosers. You'll see that in a month, I'll know more about Sicily than you Sicilians do. Here. This connection between Stefano Bontate and the Salvo cousins is very interesting. And it perfectly fits with Cesare Terranova's intuition. You remember? He spoke often about the connection between Bontate, politics and freemasons. And Gaetano Costa had realized it too. They killed both of them. Gaetano and Cesare. It's as if… as well as the two Mafia levels that we are aware of, there is a third one. A third level. Made up of successful, respected professionals tied to politics, but acting in the shadows… favoring the relations, connections and conclusions of business deals. A third level like the Salvos. A third level like the Salvos, and who knows how many others. And on this third level… nobody has ever been investigated. Coffee in a glass for Councilor Chinnici. A coffee with milk for Mr. Borsellino. A double one for Mr. Falcone and a strong one for the lady. Right? Giuseppe, you are phenomenal. You remember everything. You have an elephant's memory. Next week my son is graduating from university. With my coffees, I managed to have him study. And I owe everything to you, sir. I can never thank you enough. You don't have to thank anyone, only your honesty. -Will you bring them to the table? -Sure! Go sit down. -Mr. Falcone is paying for these. -Why me today? Why? What does he have to thank you for? He is a former convict. I met him in prison when I was D.A. in Partanna. I immediately realized he was full of humanity So when he was released, I helped him find a job. Here? I know people here. Don't worry. I guarantee it. Caterina, if you limit yourself to reading papers, it won't be enough. Don't ever forget that there is a human being in front of you. Chinnici! I was wondering if you heard the rumor that's going around Palermo. They say that whoever touches the Salvos, dies. And… And why do you come out with these words now? It's something that I heard. Vox populi. Some advice. Thank you, Barra, but we don't need your advice. I think you do. Because you people from the Examining Office must stop ruining the Sicilian economy with your exaggerated investigations, just because you like to show off and hog the limelight. Then how do you plan to fight the spreading Mafia phenomena? By going to play tennis at the club? Mafia. Mafia. You see this Mafia everywhere. You're obsessed. Like that other obsessed man, Costa. Don't you dare say the name Gaetano Costa. Understand? Miserable scum. It's also because of people like you… that Gaetano was killed. I will press charges, Chinnici. I will send an inspection or my name's not Barra! Go ahead and send an inspection, miserable scum. We'll wait for Mr. Barra's inspection. That way, this truth will come out. -All right? -Yes. -Dad. -I'm fine, I'm fine. Excuse me, but… How does Barra know we are investigating the Salvos? They killed Inzerillo too. INZERILLO EXECUTION DIRECTOR KILLED PALERMO, 12 MAY 1981 Another Corleonesi offensive. They are winning their war. The Palermitani have the entire Gambino family on their side. It won't end so soon, you'll see. Now that you'll finish your traineeship… you must indicate an office. Ask for one far away from Sicily. Do as I say. Come in. -Good morning, Councilor. -How's it going, Di Giovanni? Fine, thanks. -Miss Chinnici. -Good morning. In Inzerillo's pocket we found the phone number of a company belonging to an engineer, Lo Presti. Lo Presti? Who is he? He doesn't have a record, but is a relative of the Salvos. He married one of their cousins. -Let's tap his phone. -Very well. -Have a good day. -Thank you. A relative of the Salvos. Two weeks after we tapped his phone, a call from Brazil arrived. From a certain Roberto. Now I'll cut to the chase. Listen. Engineer, tell Nino it's not possible. Excuse me, Roberto, but Nino really does insist. He says that only you can fix up the matter. I understand. The situation really is bad. -Too many guys are dying. -But he would organize the trip from here. And you would be alone. Nobody would find out. The Nino they're talking about is Nino Salvo. And the situation that needs fixing up is the Mafia war. And why would someone like Nino Salvo, who commands practically half of Palermo, be so set on having this war end? And who is this Roberto? According to our informers, he is Tommaso Buscetta. Wow! -A big shot. -I know who he is. I told you I would catch up. It's him, right? Yes, it is him. Let's recap. The Corleonesi conquer Palermo, finishing off the Inzerillo and Bontate clans. Right? To stop the massacre, Nino Salvo asks for help from the fugitive who lives in Brazil, Tommaso Buscetta. Why? Maybe because they're afraid of doing less business during war. Or maybe they're in a hurry to get on the winners' cart. Whatever the truth may be, let's have Nino Salvo tell us in person. No, wait, Rocco. Wait. Let's think it over carefully. Before we send out an arrest warrant, let's look for stronger evidence. We risk putting him in prison, and then having to release him right away. It could ruin the work we have done so far. All right. Let's wait. Dad. Yes? Listen, in the end I chose the Caltanissetta office. Exactly what I told you not to do. Caterina. -Its closest D.A. Office is Palermo. -It is. You're stubborn, aren't you? I wonder who I take after. CALTANISSETTA Always working. You can tell she's Chinnici's daughter. Good morning! -Good morning. -Where is the judge? I am the judge. -I've been here for a week. Do you mind? -No. It's that the judge, your predecessor, entrusted me with consultancy. Excuse me. I am engineer Manlio Averna. Well, Mr. Averna, return next week. -We'll try to solve the matter. -Thank you. Have a good day. Excuse me, Judge. I was wondering… if I wait for you to finish, may I invite you for a coffee? -Well? -Nothing. -Are you ready to meet my father? -Okay. Okay. -How do I look? -Fine. Go. Here they are. Kids! Rocco. -Hi, dear. -Hi, Mom. -Good day. -Welcome. -My pleasure. I'm her mother. -My pleasure. Manlio. This is Elvira. And this is Giovanni. -Do you want-- Thank you. -It's nothing. And he is my great father. -Good day. -It's an honor to meet you. -How did the trip go? -Fine, thank you. Yes. Are we having lunch at the door? No, no. Go sit in the living room. -I'll finish preparing. -Come with me, Mr. Averna. Yes. -You can call me Manlio. -Manlio. Yes. Caterina, come, dear. Your father could've avoided the usual questioning today, right? If he did, he wouldn't be Dad. I know, but he should understand that you are grown up and independent. -Manlio would get such a bad impression. -Don't worry. I prepared him. Do you like him? He seems a handsome young man. -He isn't just handsome, Mom. -He isn't just handsome? Look how your eyes are shining! This time you're in love? Dino Ferrari 206 GT. Great model, year 1967. You were a child. -Well? Is it ready? -Yes, sit down. I'll call the kids. I like him. He has a vivacious intelligence. He is a good man. He is right for you. -I already knew that. -Yeah! Are you hot? -No. -Take your jacket off. Thank you. Come, come! It's been just a few days since Carlo Alberto Dalla Chiesa took his position at the Palermo D.A.'s Office. He is the man the state is turning to to defeat the new national emergency, the Mafia. The general defeated terrorism and will even defeat the Mafia. They must give him all the powers that he asks for. He is the hope of all honest Sicilians. But there is a lot of controversy. Yesterday evening, during a crowded press conference, Ignazio and Antonino Salvo protested against the search ordered by the new prefect at SATRIS, a family society. Mr. Salvo, excuse me. Do you have anything to declare? If they don't renew the regional tax contracts, there'll be a lot of trouble… If they're making threats like this, they must feel very strong. Have you gone against the Salvos now? That is all from Palermo. To you, at the studio. We thank our reporter from Palermo and go on to news from Rome… It seems I'm not the only one. I am discouraged, sir. Pio La Torre had to die to get your law approved. The Mafia are even killing Parliament members now. Something is moving, Bartolotta. Now Dalla Chiesa is against the Salvos as well. Anyway, Pio La Torre left us a very intelligent law. An appropriate one. A revolutionary law. Because it will allow us to work on the assets of the Mafia. To confiscate their assets. Money. It is the only thing that matters to the Mafia. And so… follow the money and find the Mafia men. You're lucky to still have young kids. It's not easy to see another man enter your daughter's life. Believe me. Even though that boy is the best I could have wanted for Caterina. I'm so jealous that I'm already worried. -Someone is there. -Get into the house, Councilor! -Stop! -Stop! Stop! Stop! Carabinieri! Stop! What is this? Salvatore. Was he in ambush here? Who knows how long he'd been here? I am sorry to say this, but this place is no longer safe. I am afraid you cannot come here anymore. I am sorry, Dad. Go, Caterina. Go. Dad suffered so much… because he couldn't come back here anymore. What is Mom doing here? Hi. -Hi, Mom. -Hi, Giovanni. -Hi, Mom. -Hi. You must forgive me. Your mother asked me to accompany her here. -Well done. -How are you? -Fine. -How did the trip go? -Guys. -Yes. -Hi, Mom. -I brought this. -Mom. -Hi. What are you doing with all this stuff? As of tonight, I am sleeping here. And I want to spend the whole summer here. It is still so lovely. This place is a part of us, and must be the heart of our family again. Listen, Manlio told me… You want to talk to me about it? -It's such a difficult decision, Mom. -I know, love. On the one hand, I feel I have the same stamina as Dad. Such a heavy commitment would not be a burden. And on the other hand? On the other hand, there are terrible memories… that I cannot erase. When Dad received the news of Dalla Chiesa's murder… I was with him. And I looked at him. I saw in his eyes he was certain he'd be next on the list. One cannot live like that. It was someone by our side. Someone who infiltrated the high positions of the State. Dalla Chiesa was investigating political collusion with Palermo and Rome. And now, nothing is left of what he did. Like us, he also suspected the Salvos. At least this time we have an identikit of this young man, aged 25 to 30 years old. He reminds me of Mario Prestifilippo, one of the Corleonesi men. This one. He usually goes around with Pino Greco, known as "Scarpuzzedda". And Nino Madonia, the killer with ice cold eyes. I am convinced of one thing, though. The Dalla Chiesa murder is like the Piersanti Mattarella and Pio La Torre one. The same method of execution. The use of submachine guns. Practically a military action. So you're saying that if the murderers' weapons are the same… why shouldn't the senders be the same too? The objective of the Apollo 13 mission was to land on the moon for the third time in the history of humanity. The astronauts… -Hello? -This is the courthouse. It is the courthouse of the Mafia speaking. We have condemned Rocco Chinnici. We will kill him. We'll kill him wherever he may be. Forget it. For years they have repeated the same things. -Don't worry. We are still here. -Yes. -I'll take you dancing tonight. -Dancing? -We've never been dancing. -Then we'll begin tonight. No, you can't go out. You don't even have your bodyguards. But we have imagination, right? Rocco. What a lovely dress you're wearing, miss. -Thanks. You don't look so bad either. -Really? -You are very elegant. -Thanks. Very kind of you. Shall we go for a quick trip to San Ciro? All right. Take me to San Ciro so I can go for a swim. For a swim? You know what? I'll go swimming tonight too! -No. -Yes. -Are you sure? -Very sure. -My head is spinning. -Oh, God, so is mine. -You are a good dancer. -Beautiful. Good morning, Dad. Good morning. I dreamed… that you were going into the water with your clothes on. Don't you have anything better to dream of? How are you? How is the investigation going? Can you tell me? Yes. It'll be in the papers in a few days, anyway. The identikit of the man who killed General Dalla Chiesa was identified by Piersanti Mattarella's wife, and also by one of Pio La Torre's agents. Now it's pretty clear the three attacks are connected. But to make totally sure, I ordered an evaluation on the arms. It will arrive in a few days. These are huge steps forward. Yes, they are steps forward. All right. This coffee is very good. I missed all this. You can come whenever you want! Even after the wedding. It will be more complicated. Dad, Manlio and I found an apartment here, on the first floor. So we can come visit you more often. Good. So you can bring me coffee. Colleague. Excuse me, who are you? Excuse me. What are you looking for? Who are you? What do you want? Why did you go up? Where are you going? Who are you? He was a man of average height, in his thirties. Black hair. With strange eyes. Neither blue nor green. -Light colored eyes. -Like ice, sir. Ice cold eyes! Stefano has seen too many movies. Go home. Stefano, thanks. -Good evening. -Good evening. Thanks. Ballistic results on the arms used in the Dalla Chiesa murder. One of the two Kalashnikovs definitely killed Inzerillo. And probably Bontate. The other one must have been used in further Mafia crimes. And it's definitive proof it's always the same director. That one, certainly. I am waiting for final verifications. Then I think we can proceed with the arrest of the Salvo cousins. I must inform you that this Summer, the holidays… will slip by dangerously. -Tell us more. -No, no. It'll bring bad luck if I tell you now, Giovanni. One piece of the puzzle is missing. Only one, to show beyond doubt that the Salvo cousins are the connecting link between politics and Mafia. And that in Rome… there is someone pulling the strings. Playing the game. And so, through the Salvos, we will finally reach the center of the labyrinth. But let's watch out the minotaur doesn't devour us. -We have a poet! -It's mythology. Trapassi, good evening. I apologize for the time. I must ask you a favor. I would do it myself, but as you know, I cannot go out. It's about my son. You made me look like a criminal. In front of my friends, my girlfriend! We'd agreed you would return early. -But you sent the Carabinieri? -There was no other way. I can't stand it in this cage anymore. A lot of my friends are afraid to associate with me. They are not good friends then! Don't make me yell. After tonight, who'll ever go out with me? Giovanni, you have become an adult. You must understand the situation. And you must understand that one cannot live like this. -What's that? I'm making you laugh? -No, you aren't. It's that I say the same thing too. I say it to my colleagues. To the High Council of the Judiciary. It's true. You argue with me, I argue with them. And what do they do to change? -Nothing. Just like you. -No, no. They do lots of things. Dad, you overreacted. It wasn't even 11. You're right, but I get agitated if you are not at home. I always think anything could happen. What can you do? You ended up with an old-fashioned father. Your father was very worried recently. Even though he still seemed himself, as strong as an ox. You were a marvelous couple. Yes. Even though it wasn't easy for us to live with his work. Nor for him, to live with my fear. I remember I once thought… he made his choice… but I didn't. And neither did my children. But then I felt selfish. What are you saying, Mom? Caterina, I say you should think it over. Because your choice will influence your husband's life. But it was a beautiful life, Mom. Yes. Mine too. Your father made it beautiful. The last period was real torture. When we said goodbye in the morning… we didn't know if we'd see each other again. Ours was like… a long goodbye. You know what, Mom? I also said goodbye to Dad without knowing it. Two days before they killed him. -Dad. -Hey, Caterina! Do you have a minute for your daughter? -Let me hug you. -What are you doing? Without a tie? Hey! With bullet proof windows and this heat I should wear a tie? Sit down. How are we doing? -Manlio, how is he? -He's fine. He is. You're not? The D.A. offered me an investigation on the Mafia. You'll have to live with bodyguards now too. I know. In fact, I don't know what to do. -I don't have much time to decide. -You'll let your conscience decide. Whatever your choice may be, it will be the right one. Does all this make sense? I sometimes wonder that too. A magistrate must work. That's his duty. It makes sense. It's that one doesn't back out when faced with a sacrifice that he knows will take place. You must not worry about anything. I would do… everything I did, over again. -I love you, Mom. -Me too. Manlio. -Manlio! -Caterina. What is it? What is it? -What is it? Why are you laughing? -I've decided to accept the assignment. I have to. You did the right thing. You did the right thing. You did the right thing. Careful. Caponnetto, Falcone and Borsellino carried on Chinnici's investigations. Those who ordered and committed the murders were convicted with a final sentence in 2003. Rocco Chinnici, Maresciallo Mario Trapassi, Lance Corporal Salvatore Bartolotta and the porter Stefano Li Sacchi died. Seventeen people were wounded. The whole country is grateful to them for sacrificing their lives and serving the nation and justice.
