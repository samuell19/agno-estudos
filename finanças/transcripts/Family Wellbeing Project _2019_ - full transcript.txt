(DIDGERIDOO MUSIC) MAN: The Family Wellbeing model itself is based around family. A lot of Aboriginal culture, our culture, the foundation of everything in our culture starts with a family. Our connection to Mother Earth, our connection to one another, our connection to the place where we belong. And unfortunately, our culture has been broken down in some ways. Our young men are coming to us with... ..and I'll go off what they've said, is that they're missing something. They feel like there's something inside of them that they're... ..they're missing. And we believe, and what we've seen throughout the program, is that's that connection to culture. Welcome to the Central Coast Primary Care Family Wellbeing documentary. In 2012, as part of the government's Taking Action to Tackle Suicide initiative, we saw a unique opportunity to work closely with our local Aboriginal community. And we wanted a program that was empowering, strength-based and created by Aboriginal people. The Family Wellbeing Program. Family Wellbeing was developed by a group of Aboriginal elders in Adelaide who had been affected by the Stolen Generation. The program aims to empower young men through personal transformation, improving their social and emotional wellbeing and enabling future leaders within the community. Our program was the first of its kind in New South Wales, and to bring the program to the Central Coast, we sought the support of Professor Komla Tsey from James Cook University, we talked to community members and local Aboriginal organisations, and recruited a team of passionate and dedicated Aboriginal men to deliver the program. This documentary is about journey - the journey of a group of brave men in our Family Wellbeing Program. They will share their story, their highs and lows, and you will share in the successes. We are proud to bring you this story - their story. Thank you. MAN: Yaama. My name's Nigel Millgate. I'm a proud Ngemba Karulkiyalu man from western New South Wales. I'm the coordinator for the Family Wellbeing Program here on the Central Coast, and I've been coordinating the program since late 2012. And throughout that time, we've had roughly 130 to 150 young men and women facilitate and come through our program. Hi. My name is Ben Cheniart. I'm a proud Dharug man, born and raised in Western Sydney, New South Wales, and I'm the Family Wellbeing Project officer with Central Coast Primary Care. Ben and I have both been fortunate enough to have been passed on a lot of cultural knowledge from role models and proud Aboriginal men that we do a lot of cultural, um... ..mentoring with. And from there, we've been able to pass on a lot of the emotional and spiritual connections that have been lost through our people for over 230 years. Our culture's...dated back over 60,000 years old, and for the last 230 years, our men have been subjected to racial vilification, drugs and alcohol, domestic violence, high rates of incarceration, high rates of suicide, and our young men, unfortunately, are at the top of that statistic around youth suicide and especially young Aboriginal men. So injecting those cultural values into these young men plays a big role in their wellbeing. First of all, it started as a community program, whereby facilitators are sent to communities to hold community meetings, and the idea was to just create safe space for ordinary community people to talk about their day-to-day challenges they face in life and the ways in which they try to solve day-to-day problems and share with each other, whether it's about parenting, whether it's about relationship issues, education, employment, and then build support networks. So, the program started like that - as a community development activity, and the idea was that the more people that go through the program, develop communication skills, support skills, then the stronger their community becomes and then their community is able to support individuals to participate in education and employment. In 1998, there were a number of suicides in the community, young people taking their lives for reasons that was hard for people to see, so their community mobilised, all the community organisations, and decided something had to be done about it. And it was in that context that they... ..they got funding from the National Suicide Prevention funding at the time and then got the South Australian facilitators to bring that program to Alice Springs. The Family Wellbeing Program commenced in 2012 through a collaborative effort between Medicare Local, the local health district, and the Aboriginal Medical Service, and it was targeted around suicide prevention for young Aboriginal men. We flew to South Australia to meet with delegates of the Family Wellbeing Program. From there, we moved back to the Central Coast and started facilitating the Family Wellbeing Program. So, the Family Wellbeing Program on the Central Coast is targeted towards young Aboriginal men between the ages of 14 to 18, where we take the boys out of school one day a week and train them in a social and emotional wellbeing program that aims to empower each individual through a range of topics over a 10- to 14-week program. On the first day of program, we introduce the boys to a cultural ceremony that is the smoking ceremony. And the way we segue the young men on that first day into that smoking ceremony is to talk to them about a new beginning and a new lease on life and the start of a new journey through the Family Wellbeing Program. And we introduce them to their first cultural aspect of Family Wellbeing, and that's that smoking ceremony. And I think the best thing to see about that cultural aspect of a smoking ceremony is that hesitation that the boys do have initially when they come to the smoke, and not because of the fact that they might be scared of it, but I think it's more or less because they've never had this experience before, but they know through their connection as time goes on that this smoking ceremony is very symbolic to them. And that's what we say - it is a ceremonial process, but for these boys, when they transition through the program, when they have their final smoking ceremony, you do see that change and that appreciation for it. You see them actually getting involved and the emotions that are in that smoking ceremony. They're in that moment, and whatever's going on inside of them, it's therapeutic. They let it all go, they put it into that fire, and up it goes again, and they know that's a spiritual process for them. MAN: My experience with the Family Wellbeing course has been a great journey. Growing up as a young Aboriginal man, you know, sometimes you get lost. With the Family Wellbeing, it's an opportunity to bring out your cultural side, your feelings, and to show other men that it is OK to talk about our feelings. We arrive at the centre between 9:00 and 9:30, and by that time, Ben's there with the barbecue and we're cooking the boys a breakfast that consists of bacon and eggs and juice and stuff that, you know, sometimes boys skip on, and we talk about basic human needs, and that first meal form is a good meal, something that, you know, they mightn't get every day at home in their lives. Leading into the Family Wellbeing Program, I still remember my first day. I got there and there was breakfast - you know, everyone loves a bacon and egg roll. Seeing Nigel and the other facilitators standing there as proud Aboriginal men and looking around to my peers in my classroom, it was hard, it was hard. I didn't want to sit there and talk about my feelings. These men, I didn't know them. Once Nigel and the other facilitators and these men started to open up, I'd realised that it was a safe place. Being able to express myself to a group of men within that room felt good. The beauty of our process in Family Wellbeing is that Nigel and myself, unlike in a school environment, get that opportunity to share our own personal life journeys. With the sharing of your own personal story, this allows a domain, a safe domain for these young men to actually come out and share their own experiences. When they felt comfortable, the boys will naturally open up and flourish and they'll share their own experiences. We had a young fella, me and Nigel told our story, and without even asking him, he put his hand up, he goes, "Oh, I just want to share a bit about my story." I'm like, "Oh!" We were like, "Oh, this is mad. Yeah, thanks, buddy." It was heavy. So, he's saying, you know, he's 14. "I got into ice, got into drugs, alcohol, "fighting Mum and Dad and my sister. "We had a bad life, always out in the streets. "I got locked up out at Baxter." He goes, "But it's only just recently "I've had a bit of a turnaround, "stopped hanging around with all my mates, "got off the ice, got off the drugs..." And then come to realise that their brother next to them has a very similar story to their own. The brother on the other side, he has a very similar story to their story. At the end of the day, we're all walking that same path and that journey. And that's what Family Wellbeing's about - that initial journey that we're setting that foundation for. Yeah. And we've got to remember too that... ..the Family Wellbeing model is a counselling model, and if you mention counselling to young men that are vulnerable or at a stage in their life where things are starting to go downhill, they put their walls up when you mention counselling. So we throw it at them as a youth leadership program, but internally, what they don't realise is that they're actually doing a form of counselling. Our old people for many years have had yarning circles, where we'd sit in a circle and we'd talk about our differences, we'd talk about our problems, we'd talk about, you know, where to from here, what's next, what we're doing. You know, I remember growing up in western New South Wales, where if you broke up with your girlfriend or something went wrong, you'd go and have a schooner of beer, or the next minute, you'd be physically fighting with someone around dealing with your emotions, and that's all it was. So, we're trying to change that stigma or that culture around young men coming together. And as Benny said, it's a vulnerable day. We have, you know, between 10 and 15 young men that probably haven't met each other ever until this day, and within the space of probably 30 minutes, we've got young men that are vulnerable, emotional, sharing their story. And it might sound a little bit depressing, but at the end of it, there's a sense of spiritual relief for these young men. You can actually see a weight taken off their shoulders. ..I think around about five, I got taken away from my mum and I got put into DOCS. Um, my name's Liam, and, um...I've been through a rough childhood. Um... My mum and dad split up, and, um...about...a year ago, my nan passed away. And, um... ..this year, my pop passed away. Uh...my name's Josh. I was born around this area. Um...had an alright childhood, Dad and Mum split up... Take your time, bro. You can cry here. It's a good place to let them out. (SOBS QUIETLY) Um, my name's Bailey Carney. Um, I come from Wiradjuri tribe... (SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY) ..which is about five, six hours west of here, near Gilgandra, Coonabarabran. I live with my brother and mum, and me and Terence go to school at Erina High. And, um, yeah, when I was younger... ..my father passed away. And, um... ..yeah, it's really...really tough. That's about it. Thanks, brother. Thanks, brother. (APPLAUSE) Yeah, same as him. (SNIFFLES) It's alright, man. Tears... You seen me cry last week. Tears are good. Yeah, my name's Leigham. I go to Erina, and... ..when we were three, my dad passed away. And... ..Mum, she's looked after us ever since, and... ..she's been the best. And, yeah...been... Life's been heaps good and... love our sport and stuff and... Yeah, that's about it. School's good. When I found out that, started getting suspended from school, going out on the weekends getting drunk. And then Mum started going through chemo, started getting better, better. She met my stepdad now. When they were kids, they were friends. Mum's finished her chemo. Starting to get better at school. Haven't been suspended as much. We're in a new house. And just...getting better. For young men to sit in a circle with 15 other young men and share their story and let tears roll down their face is...is a powerful, powerful domain. An aspect of the cultural inclusion we introduced into Family Wellbeing is that we actually get to take our young men out on some... ..out to some cultural sites on country, and we do that with the permission of the traditional owners here on the Central Coast, so we're very grateful for that. Our young men that come through the program are missing that link to their culture and that connection to their culture, so taking them out onto country and introducing them to our old people's classrooms that are engraved or through stencils in caves gives these young men a visual aspect of what our culture and our learnings and education systems were like prior to colonisation. Through this process, we're able to teach the morals and the stories of what comes from that stencil on the wall or the engraving in the ground. Also look at things around understanding relationships and how the relationships in their lives today can play a role in where they want to go and how they grow as individuals. Through the Family Wellbeing Program, the boys actually get to attend community events, and the one that stands out the most to me for our boys was attending the Walk a Mile Koori Style. Walk a Mile Koori Style is an initiative alongside the White Ribbon approach, where we're going to aim awareness for domestic violence in our community. The main aspect of that is showing strong, proud Aboriginal men and women who are coming together to show their support against domestic violence on the Central Coast community. The greatest thing that... for myself and Nigel was that we saw our young men in the Family Wellbeing Program take part in that, and they marched down the streets of the Central Coast showing their pride and standing for a cause that's very close to heart for a lot of people here on the Central Coast. With that, that just shows the initiative that young men can take in being valuable leaders to not only their homes in community, but also to all those other people who are watching on. They're playing that role-modelling that people can see and look up to and inspire, and that's what we want from Family Wellbeing. And Walk a Mile Koori Style was a great example of how that comes to be, and that comes to be something that the boys can be very proud of and that myself and Nigel, we're very proud to see that initiative. It takes a whole community to raise a child, and children grow up to become adolescents, young people, young people grow up to become adults, adults grow up to become the elders, old... ..you know, elders of their community. This is how most communities have functioned historically. Now, Family Wellbeing was developed specifically to build a sense of community, a sense of community that can raise a child. And in the first few years of Family Wellbeing development in Central Australia, there were Family Wellbeing centres, integral parts of communities in Central Australia and in places like Ceduna. The idea was to have a place where people have these conversations on ongoing basis and develop support networks so people can take a whole-of-community perspective to dealing with issues including raising children. Unfortunately, the nature of funding environment in Australia didn't support this vision. Now, one of the goals of the new national Family Wellbeing partnership is to bring that vision back to reality. Family Wellbeing goes some ways in bringing organisations... ..community groups, men's groups, women's groups, schools, services together in any local... ..you know, regional, local and community level. One of the most powerful outings that Family Wellbeing has is our visit to the Glen Drug and Alcohol Rehabilitation Centre at Chittaway Bay here on the Central Coast. The greatest thing about the Glen is it provides our young men with an opportunity to witness face to face with other men who have experienced extensive abuse when it comes to drug and alcohol issues. So the boys are confronted with one-on-one situations where they're sitting with men who have lived experiences and they're seeing how their life has changed dramatically in a negative way initially, but from that strength, they're having to rehabilitate themselves. And you do see a lot of boys walk away from that experience kind of really taken back, and even in some instances, I have seen some boys turn around and say, "You know what? "Ben, I'm not gonna smoke any more yarndi. "After seeing that experience of what happened to that fella, "I'm done with that." So, basically, what we hope from the Glen is that we're gonna get a bit of empowerment where we see young men taking charge of their drug and alcohol use and finding ways in which they can channel that and see, "Hey, if I keep going down this path, "I'm gonna end up in a place like this," and that's somewhere definitely those boys don't want to be. At the conclusion of the Family Wellbeing Program, the boys move into the mentoring side of things, and two weeks after the program, we take the boys on a two-day cultural camp, where we take the boys out of the world that they know with their iPhones and iPads and PlayStations, and we take them out to Wollombi, where we utilise skills and old, traditional values and site visits and Aboriginal dance and storytelling, and using those old values with the new values that we've given them through the Family Wellbeing program, and infuse those so that the boys have the best of both worlds. Because as Aboriginal people in this world now, we've got to walk two worlds - the cultural world and the Westernised world. (HISSES) The essence of the Family Wellbeing is basically saying that as human beings, we all experience challenges in our lives, particularly in terms of modern living. For Indigenous people, being minorities in their own country, for non-Indigenous people, and for everybody living in a very busy society where day-to-day problems, the challenges we face are so complex, they don't have any simple answers. It's a humbling experience. We sit down, we have those yarning circles, we have that smoking ceremony to welcome us into country. From there, we've run little activities where... ..we introduce boys to a ceremonial process of signing into country. We take boys to a cave we have on private property and we introduce them to putting their own hand stencil onto a cave wall. And some might think this is just... you know, it's an artist's exercise or it's just a little bit of fun, but for them boys, and for us as Aboriginal men and role models, it's a ceremonial process that they're connecting to that country. And once they've put that hand stencil on that wall, they have an obligation to care for that property. So, through the stencil and the connection, they put themselves onto that...onto that wall, these boys then feel a bit of ownership and a sense of belonging to that property. So, from there, they help clean up the property, they look after it, they don't leave their rubbish around, and that might be minuscule to some, but for our boys and where they're at in their lives, you know, having that sense of belonging and connection to something is major for them. Some of our boys, you know, they don't have that connection to...at home, because home life might be a little bit destructive or they don't have that sense of ownership yet because they're 14 or they're 15. And we're able to introduce them to that sense of belonging and ownership through our camps. The components that Family Wellbeing teaches the boys then does play a role in those camps. And when it comes to... I guess the best word we use and we'll use something a bit more traditional, is those obligations those boys have not only to themselves, but also to upholding those values that we introduce to them. The camp gives the boys an opportunity to take the person they've become and flourish in a cultural environment. And that's through processes such as, like Nigel mentioned earlier, about putting a hand stencil on a wall, about crush... just simply crushing the ochre, learning about that process and why that importance of that ochre has, getting the opportunity to do a paint-up that's special to them. So, a lot of the boys might be already very familiar with a specific paint-up that they like to put on their bodies that actually represents where they may come from in the country that they might be on at that time. The boys also get the opportunity to explore new areas and various sites that they probably never, ever will get the chance to see, but it's through those practices that the boys show a lot of empowerment. And at the end of that process, you get boys walking out saying, "That was by far the best thing I've ever experienced." And this is proven throughout every single camp that we have run, not just this particular camp, but all the camps that we have - the boys walk away with that sense of connection and that longing, saying to us, "Oh, I don't want this program to end. "This was the best experience. I wish we could stay out here longer." That just goes to show that the life that a lot of the boys probably lead outside of that environment, even though sometimes it can be very positive, but all those destructive elements in there really go to show that those boys being in that comfort zone of being out in bush gives them that security, gives them that belonging. BOY: Got pretty much a new family. Lots of close mates, good people to be around. I learnt, like, leadership goals and, like, how far I want to be with my other boys outside of the group, and, like, it's given me a lot of thought about that sort of stuff and, like, where I want to be in 20 years, stuff like that. Like, life goals and, um... and pretty much a new family. Uh, I have, like, new adolescence skills and, um...yeah, new mates and... ..good blokes to be around. Nigel and Ben, to talk to whenever we need, and I met new people. It's just been good. If we lose our traditions, then we're gonna lose ourself, basically, and our spirits and that, and we don't really want to do that. We want to pass it on and that and be able to learn and do this stuff. Important for us to know these skills and, like, to keep our tradition and our culture in our lives. Because without it, we wouldn't be nothing. We wouldn't be ourselves. And...yeah, just wouldn't be us. Like, our culture and tradition, like, gives us, like, a... ..like, if you're lost, if you don't know what to do, it gives us something...like, a way of life, something you can live by, something to help you, like, no matter what, so you always have, like, rules and guidelines that can help you. It gives us something to be proud of and something to pass down and keep the culture going. 'Cause, like, it's good to know your... ..what people have been... happened before you and to continue the ways and traditions they had. MAN: Family Wellbeing is something that needs to continue. It needs to continue to show our young Aboriginal men that it is OK to talk, to face our demons, and to move forward and become strong Aboriginal men. Aboriginal culture is a lifeline for people like myself and the boys that come through this course. The cultural components that we learn throughout the Family Wellbeing is something that... was a link that was missing, and putting those links together, everything fell in place for my life. Family Wellbeing always needs to be there. Men like Nigel and Ben and future facilitators need to be there. This is not an average course. This is a course for Aboriginal men to stand strong, stay strong and be proud of who we are. If we want to bring about change in Australia, then programs such as Family Wellbeing needs to be supported, needs to become organic part of... ..the way we do education, health and other business in communities over a long period of time. And if that can happen, then we can see change, sustainable change, over time. The Family Wellbeing Program's probably changed my life in such things like...um... ..like, relationships, friends and... ..looking at different... ..a different way of looking at, like, relationships and friends. Um...like, cultural dance. Yeah, dancing with Nigel, the Wakagetti group. Well, today, now, I have, like... I muck up a bit still, but I'm better than what I was before. I am able to open up to people and tell them what's wrong when something's happening with me, I'm able to express my feelings more than what I was before, and I feel like a better person and that I can achieve things and that it's not all bad at the end, and you've got to have bad things come around to get the good things as well. Family Wellbeing loves to celebrate all achievements not only just through the process itself, but all the achievements that the boys have outside of the program. The biggest milestone that they had was actually completing that program with a success rate of 80% or more in attendance. As a token of the program and something for the boys to reflect on is the boys are given their very own Family Wellbeing shirt. The Family Wellbeing shirt represents a very strong coastal design, which has been made into a format that not only is very appealing marketing-wise, but also gives people an element of what the boys have achieved. We like to think of it as a trophy for their accomplishments, and with that trophy, when times get tough or when they need to reflect on a moment of... ..any issues that do arise and they do need to think back to those lessons, the Family Wellbeing shirt's always gonna be there for them to look at and to kind of remind them of that process and that journey that they've gone through. That shirt is a representation of the men that they have become and who they're going to be for the future. (DIDGERIDOO PLAYS) (MEN SHOUT, TRILL) Captions by Red Bee Media (c) SBS Australia 2022
