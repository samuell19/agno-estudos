If that's what you want... So long Magdalena Let's go already - What's your name? - Magdalena - Keep going please. - What's yours? Well, the show is over. We can go whenever you want Come on Magdalena, are you done? With what? Nothing. It's just that you have been in there for hours. Can you hurry up? Don't be so annoying. Can't you leave me alone for a while? I'm just worrying about tonight. You know he's a big shot right? You can't keep him waiting - It's still early - Is it? Then... Lets enjoy ourselves - You want to? - Of course No! What do you mean "No"? What... Who do you think you are? I'm not in the mood Why? Tell me Come on, tell me. Explain it to me Why don't you want to? Are you hungry? At this time? No... See? You're not hungry and I'm not in the mood to make love with you Then... Who do you want to make love with? With the Congressman? Or maybe... With that beggar? The one with the guitar? Trust me Magdalena Always do as I tell you, okay? Always... We have travelled the whole Adriatic. Italy, Yugoslavia... It's a beautiful Yacht. And it's not just because I say so. 16 metres in length 16 metres? Nowadays Yachts aren't a luxury. They are a necessity At the end of the day, relax is like a medicine for us Of course. If you don't relax a little... It's like sleeping, if you're sleeping with somebody of course. If not its really boring - Why don't you come with us next time? - Sure, why not I can't relax, I have to work hard to make a living I live alone. I don't have friends So I have to be careful With how much I spend But... aren't you an actress? Yes! Well, I do some parts once in a while But you already know what kind of environment that is Sooner or later everyone wants to sleep with you And I don't like that I like to make love... But only with who I like And I like you Liar No, I'm completely serious Look, my mother is ill. And my brother is still in school I have to take care of everything Did you know I had to refuse a big role to come and see you today? Three days of work - How much did they pay? - 300000 They pay you well That's because I'm worth a lot, you know? I'm really good I believe it If you stay with me you won't regret it You're an angel Do you understand? Yes, did you tell her to not let him get on top? Why? - If he gets on top, she could die - Nonsense What are you doing? - Nothing - Are you okay? Do you want to sit down? Yes... I don't feel well My head is spinning Excuse me a moment Hello, what's going on? He left right? I wish. That way, I wouldn't have to see him again What are you saying? Are you crazy? He reeks of money Maybe... But tonight there are some smells I don't like Don't be stupid. I wish he was coming with me - You can't have him if you want - Sure Nobody would leave someone like him You're crazy Besides, you'll have to work out the money with that friend of yours He has a good business sense. He always finds rich clients. He knows how to do his job You can keep him too - You would regret it if we swapped. - Who said anything about swapping? You're going all out with changes tonight You must be drunk What do you drink? Whisky or champagne? What are you drawing? It looks like a prophet Magdalena A prophet... In a place like this... You're very pale. Are you ill? Yes. I've a terrible headache It's probably the heat or maybe the smoke Do you want me to take you home? You're very kind, but I don't know if... Yes, let's go - Are you better? - No, I feel even worse - I was really looking forward to tonight... - Who knows, you might recover in a while And to think I said I had an interview with the Undersecretary to be with you I'm very sorry. But he'll have to wait until tomorrow night The Undersecretary? Well. We'll postpone the interview if you think you won't get any better My poor mother was desperate today She's getting evicted tomorrow and I told her I would help We all have a mother Nothing for my little brother? Let your brother alone for a while. At least until tomorrow night - Goodbye - Goodbye - Good night - Best regards to your mother Her mother... She must be the same as her And I fell for it like an idiot Yes? Hello? Yes, it's me Who is this? Magdalena? - What time is it? - Quarter past two Day or night? Look out your window Are you crazy? Of course I was sleeping What happened? What? What kind of little favour do you want? I don't think I understand you You wake me up in the middle of the night to ask if I get can some bums out of jail? Please don't try to fight me You always end up doing what I say We know each other very intimately And you're... You're a really powerful man You could do it with a single call But if I call at this time of the night, they will think I'm crazy If they have been arrested, there has to be a reason No, shut up. I don't want to know what you're wearing I don't care I'm wearing a pair of black thigh high stockings And nothing else... My earrings My perfume. And now I'll tell you what position I'm in Fine, that's enough If it's true they arrested them to testify I'll see what I can do for them But one of these nights we need to see each other okay? And I'm going to make you pay for everything This little favour What you described to me Everything. Alright? Goodbye Hello Hello - Surprised? - Of course What are you doing here? Why do you care? Do you need a ride? - We won't all fit into the car - Why? Scared to come alone? Go with her if you want Don't worry about us I'll see you later - You got us out? - Yes - Why? - Because I thought you would be better in my home than in jail Help yourself to a drink if you want. I will be right back You don't have much experience with women Right? Come on, don't be shy It's nothing to be ashamed of See, I realised right away You wanted to pretend you had a lot and... that's nonsense That's why I liked you Listen Why don't you come here? Come on Am I wrong? Maybe you have a lot of experience I don't know Maybe that's your technique A way to... To make me want you. But I... Hello? Yes, why are you calling? Of course he is still here No, I'm sorry but I can't Yes yes, he gave it to me. Don't worry No I can't. I'll call you back Are you coming? What are you waiting for? Magdalena How did you find me? I have a lot of friends, you should know - I already thanked you - Thank me? You offended me - If I did I'm sorry - Do you doubt it? You're the first man that has rejected me I didn't reject you, on the contrary I have been looking for you I wanted to get closer to you But in a different way that yours I wanted to talk. Get to know you better But I offered you love Clearly we don't understand the same thing for love Actually... Love is very simple Where is the difference? Love is love. It doesn't have to be a commitment It's very pleasant Why would you settle for that? Is that your life? There was a girl that lived in the country One day going to the mill She meets three men She doesn't think about love. But they lust after her. They rape her Since then, every time I find a man I like I want to make love to him To remember those feelings. That pleasure. That love Yours is a sad story What you have told me... Was a horrible thing that has traumatised you for life But don't you ever make love? See? You're confusing love with sex And they are... Two different things I don't understand you Do you and your friends never feel the need for sex? What kind of people are you? We like making love. But only if there is love. Do you understand it now? Life is love Its kindness. Not violence We are all one. And each is part of the other What are you trying to get to? If you can free yourself from your temptations You'll always be free Free... You know I'm not a slave But don't we matter at all? We matter a lot Look around We are part of this world You're the same as me, the same as everybody else You have the same rights But you're also forced to give You can't only take. Don't you think? Maybe. Maybe you're right But I'm not saying you aren't The thing is that I make love and you only talk about it Stop trying to justify your lust - under the mask of love like it... - See? You're judging everything I say Without any sense of reality. Nor charity. And all this... All this because I tried to have some fun with you I though "I like him" and maybe... Deep down he likes me - Why can't we be together? - Magdalena... I tried to explain it to you It's hard to forget the past But maybe one day you will. Who knows... Goodbye Well, look who's here... I have been waiting for hours Where have you been? Why do you care? Don't talk to me I'm in a bad mood Is that so? So you don't want to tell me where you have been? And of course... - You forgot we had another client today. - No, but I'm not going. Sure... You already have last night's money So what? So what? That he gave you a lot less money than agreed You don't fool me! This isn't 30000 lire And now you're lying to me again I already know who have you been with - You were with that bum - So what if I was? I can see whomever I want. Do you understand? I don't have to tell anybody anything I do - Not even you - Really? You were asking for it - Bastard! Asshole! You pig - Sure I'm not your slave you know? Get out! Get out of my house! Out! - I don't want to see you anymore. I'm tired of you! - Come on - I can't do it anymore... Let me go! Let me go! - Calm down, easy! - I don't want to! Stop... - Calm down. What's wrong with you? - Let me go. Leave me alone! - What's your problem? No... I don't want to. I don't want to! Stop... Stop... Yes? No, I was sleeping Yes... Yes, alone No! I told you no! I don't want to! But... Do you know how much he pays? - I don't care! - 400000 lire! Are you deaf? - I said 400 - Why don't you go yourself then? - Try putting yourself in my place - That's enough. Stop joking and get ready - You're meeting him at five o'clock - Why won't you listen to me? I said I'm not going! - All that money for just an hour. Are you crazy? - No! Listen, I'm done. I can't keep going. I don't want to keep selling myself for the hour like a hotel room Is that clear? You can tell all your friends, all of them, businessman, congressman, diplomats, that if they want to get some they'll have to go to the Lungotevere It'll be cheaper And you... I don't want to see you again! Go to hell! - You've already meet Magdalena, can we give her a ride? - Is she paying the gas? - Come on, don't be rude - Fine, get in Hello Hello Magdalena. Where's your friend? It's been a while since I last saw him Didn't you know? Magdalena left him Really? Do you mean he changed pimps? No way I'm done with pimps - I'm tired of it - Really? You're getting brave No, it's not that. It isn't bravery No? Then what is it? Tiredness Say, are we taking a detour? Why do you care? Shut your mouth If we get there in time I'll show you something Ah, just in time I think we are in luck But... What's happening? I don't know No! No! Harder! Don't hit her! Stop! Stop! - Shut up! - No! Stop... Stop... No! No! Please... Grab her No. No! No! Motherfuckers! Leave us alone! No! Stop! Stop! Bastards! Weren't you happy with us? We didn't treat you that bad. Right? Bitch! No! No! No! No! Stop! Leave me alone! Let me go! Bastards! No! No! Why don't you let me fight assholes! Please no... Enough! What are you going to do? Stab me? No! No! No! You fucking cocksucker I swear you'll pay for this Tell her to be ready when we get back You've had enough for now She had earned it. She wanted to leave us... When Magdalena told me you two hadn't done anything I didn't believe her But now I get it The thing is she still wants to make love with you. And until she does... She won't leave you alone What are you waiting for to sleep with her? What's the problem? This way she will calm down Well, what do you say? I'm giving you permission Don't you like her? Hey, why are you leaving? No, not like this Why? - Don't you like women? - Listen friend That's enough. Why won't you leave us alone? Let's go Eh, wait! Wait! You don't need to run away. What do you want? Money? We can always find a solution right? Come on, wait a moment What the hell do you guys want? Easy Love And friendship Any problems with that? Well... In that case we can make a deal - We aren't interested - I don't get it You look like hippies. No offense That's okay, but you still need some money to stay alive As you can see, we are alive Touch us, we aren't ghosts But what money do you live with? Nobody can live with only bread - You think we need money? - Of course, and a lot of it - To buy presents for the mistress - To dress in the latest trend - To buy a car - A stylish house - Antique furniture - Luxuries The social standing And at the end, a big gravestone. Bigger than the rest What's your problem? Don't you want those things? Don't you like them? Those things don't interest us I'm done with you guys. You're too weird You look down on women - Unless you're... - Some faggots He's angry because I won't sleep with his girlfriend Of course, he owns Magdalena He tells her where and with who Without even asking her of course Magdalena spread your legs, Magdalena close your legs - Magdalena, do this - Magdalena, you can't do that That's enough! You had your laughs You're right. Forgive us It's just that we worship some things Of course, love and friendship You already told me It's been nice to meet you then Let's rehearse Excuse me, but can I ask you a question? Do you guys play seriously? I mean, are you in a band? Of course, you said it yourself Everybody needs money - And where do you guys play? - Wherever they call us I think we got the wrong address. There's already music here Hi Excuse me, let me through Well, look who is it Surprised to see me here? We were having a party and I thought why don't let those kids play some music and make a few bucks? Thanks, you're too kind Please, come in Go on Who are this guys? Friends of Magdalena Adriana Come here That surprise I told you about is here - Not bad - Right? Where did you get them? We want to have some fun Get up, I'm tired of this Friends! Friends... This boys... At a first glance, they don't look like much - but once you get to know them - They stink You see they have something special They are geniuses - I swear - If you say so... - They are amazing - Amazing is an understatement Do you want to leave? That's why I wanted them to come to our party Not only as guests, but as the stars of this party Let's go - I swear, they are extraordinary - Let's get out Hey listen, are you guys leaving? You just got here. They party isn't over We just started, we can't let you go yet If they are so good make them stay If would be a shame if they left Did you lock the door? And now... Enjoy! The show is starting She put that key in the safe Yeah sure, a big safe What are you doing? Are you crazy? You're going to ruin my house Don't take it personally Gentleman, it's time for the show First, I have to tell you who these guys are As I already said they look like bums, but don't let that trick you They are pretty cute actually They live from spirituality only, nothing else. They preach about brotherhood, love... Well, not exactly love. It's love but without commitment because they live from the spirit instead of flesh It seem that when they have to do something... I'm explaining it okay? Why don't you get to the point? Are you going to tell us what this is about? Yes, but... Listen, why don't you explain it? Come on, don't be shy - What? - Are you deaf? Say something You'll have to excuse him friends It looks like he didn't read the script Or maybe... Yes... It's you and your hostility, you bastards! That's what you are - That's why he won't... - What hostility? Yes, hostility. I'll explain it to you later Come on, you know the script Don't worry, I'll help you What hostility were you talking about? - Maybe they are monks - They defend morality? What morality? Listen Do you want to know who am I? I'm a son of a bitch that to the disgrace of my ancestors... I have become somebody that sees everything distorted and I surround myself with imbeciles that agree with my beliefs. And if you want... Come on - Imbeciles that agree with my beliefs - Are you kidding me? What kind of man is that? As for women. Instead of lying to them, which would be very rude and boring I don't even try to do anything with them Because I'm... impotent Impotent in a metaphorical sense of course Do you understand? It's not so easy to destroy a man Not even with sarcasm Nor with low blows He got angry We just wanted to have a laugh That's enough insults, I can assure you I wouldn't laugh if I was in your shoes You don't even know what your laughing about You laugh of your own jokes You're only animals You refuse to understand. To listen Because you're all the same A husk of a human You think your life is so great? You think you're men because you have big dicks? Or women because you sell something that anyone with money can have? You're filth A bunch of clowns. And not only that... you're convinced that you're having fun because of your jokes And because the rest laughs when you tell them You make a lot of money, that's true You think you own everything But are you really? Just some losers You're empty like rotten nuts Empty! That's why you make so much noise when you get together That's why you're so easy to crush It only takes somebody that is willing to hit back and you all turn into cowards There might still be a shadow inside you... Of what it could have been But hasn't been Because you have given up. You have given up on life You have given up love And you have become slaves of your money Slaves of your desires None of you are free from your need of money and flesh He's not as crazy as I thought... Why don't you get it yourself? The key is here Right here That's "The Mouth of Truth" Come The legend says if you put your hand in it and you don't tell the truth it will bite it off You go first. I want to ask you something Wait. Can I ask first? Sure, go ahead - Do you... Do you love me? - What? Nothing... I was joking Let's see... What can I ask... Wait While you're thinking put your hand in the mouth. It's your turn - Is it a difficult question? - No It isn't You need to focus Yes, ask me Examine your conscience Are you ready? - Good, now tell me... - Yes Who are you? I'm Magdalena And I love you I love you I love you! I love you! I love you! I love you! - I love you! - Stop it Magdalena Wait, I need to tell you something else Thank you Why? I don't know, maybe because... I feel like I owe you so much Nothing, nobody has seen her I think Magdalena is gone for good What are you saying, she's just fooling around Yes, with that dude you tried to make fun of You think? You talk too much... You make us sleep with everybody This time she wanted to pick the client right? What client? That guy doesn't have a penny And they made you look like an idiot Yes, but if you think about it, it is also your fault I had my little game planned to teach them a lesson - then nobody played along and... - Yes, you need to stop with those games You looked like a clown And I'm not going to be friends with any clown You guys only think about money right? I already told you Magdalena is gone You only say that because you don't know her Magdalena is a good girl, she will come back Of course, she'll come back I'm sorry darling, I won't do it again I'm sorry I made you look like a fool in front of your friends But I'm back willing to give you a nice bath and sing you a lullaby. Like a baby Shut up, I would love to see you in my shoes - I would like that too - Get that idea out of your mind Because if you try anything like this you'll pay for it dearly blondie You make me laugh You scare me so much I'm trembling You blowing this out of proportion Magdalena... She wanted to treat herself that's all It's not the end of the world is it? Come on man, don't be stupid You don't get it do you? Magdalena is gone. You won't see her again She just wanted to get away from this If she stops working, he stops making money - He depends on her right? - How can you say that I'm very close to Magdalena. Very close Yes, like Siamese twins You want to bet she comes back home tonight? If you keep thinking about her, you'll go crazy At last. Are you alone or with that bum? By the way Thank you You made me look great in front of my friends Listen, if you wanted to sleep around, you could have done so more discreetly For your information, I didn't sleep with anyone Then where have you been? I've been looking for you all day I just came to give you this What do you mean? I'll give you everything else As soon as possible Nothing else? Yes, I'm leaving you There is nothing else to say I get it You want to change pimps? I don't want to have another pimp No, no no, that's not okay After everything I have done for you You didn't do it for free Magdalena... Listen to me, I get it. You're tired, nervous We can take some days off, go on a holiday But you can't leave me like this Then find yourself another girl. It won't be hard Don't you get that I don't want the other girls? - I want you - Please... What's wrong with you? It's very easy to taunt a coward - Don't you think so? - Sure It takes character to fuck with real men And guts Stop it man, don't take it personally And you, shut up please. We are trying to play My turn Do you remember when Rosario escaped with that guy from Milan? I have a friend... That always said that a man shows what he really is when someone takes his woman You need to teach them a lesson right? But then some hippy comes around Takes her And he shuts up and doesn't do anything Hey Gino You want to fight? What's your problem? I'm not saying anything Don't you like criticism? Shut up for a while. Let us finish this game Come on, don't listen to him But what kind of a man are you? That's my problem That's where you're wrong, it's our problem too We are all together in this If you don't do something about that hippy freak and Magdalena You're giving some pretty bad ideas to our girls But no, you shut up and lock yourself at home Magdalena no, Magdalena is good She won't go anywhere Come on, keep playing You should try to fight sometimes At least this time Listen man, listen to me If I was in your shoes I would let him go Violence doesn't fix anything... My friend He thought I was threatening you But I don't wish you any harm Why are you looking at me like that? - Are you still angry about the party? - No, no I hope you aren't You stole my girl But I warn you, she's a whore So what? What do you mean "So what?" Excuse me, he'll believe you. Could you explain who she is? Nobody asked you about her And now leave, please He can stay if he wants Why did you come here? Listen, I like you I'm not angry about what you have done to me I'm just telling you because you're very naive But with that whore Magdalena... You won't get anything. Listen to me That's why she needs me more that she needs you No... No... Who are you trying to fool? It's you who needs her Look where you live You need her With Magdalena, you will make some money - You don't believe me? - I'm getting tired of you I don't want to see you again Remember, Magdalena is just a whore Do you understand? A whore! A whore! Stop going out with that hippy faggot If you don't... It will be much worse Magdalena? Magdalena? Concierge? - Concierge? - Yes? Has the lady from the second floor come back yet? I don't think so, I haven't seen her Did she leave a note? I was meeting with her I just got here but... No. She didn't leave a note - Thanks - You're welcome You can't complain, he won't find you here Hello Forgive me for coming in but I saw the door open and... There isn't anything to steal here You're too trusting Drink Thanks To your health What do you want? Yes... As I was saying, you're too trusting And that's bad because... Then you don't see things as they are You lose your sense of reality Like Magdalena Magdalena? I'm really sorry she ended up like this Believe me I already told you she was a whore. Don't you remember? Forgive me for insisting but a whore is a whore She'll never change No matter how hard you try At least she lived a good life with me Did you see where she lived? A good apartment Fancy Always well dressed And at work, she was a princess She could even choose But now... Everything has changed They don't care anymore As long as they pay See? Not even your friendship made her change Now there's two idiots... You and me But... What do you mean? Where is she? With her old friend Yes, you know. Her old pimp She went back to her old life Magdalena can't say no to anybody And now... Poor thing Deep down I feel sorry. It's a very sad ending Don't you think? I knew it At first it also seemed impossible to me With what she has been, to let go like this You can see for yourself. Go there and see You'll find her there from nine o'clock onward There... Where all the whores work Who are these guys? Hey guys, where are you going? You want some company? What's the hurry? They won't stop, probably two fags Hey baby, you want a quick one? I'll give you a discount Listen, I'm looking for Magdalena Do you know her? Magdalena? I don't know who that is She doesn't work here. Unless she is a new girl - They are looking for a girl, Magdalena. - See? I told you it was impossible. Let's get out of here I want to be sure Leave Please Run It's a trap They want to kill you - Look. There is a car down there - It's them! You're right. It's a trap Now What do you want? We just want some answers No! Are you friends? No, he just asked me to go with him Come on, get in the car Come on, take your shirt off faggot Come on keep going On your knees And now we want to enjoy the show Fuck her! Are you deaf? Fuck her! Too bad I'm begging you Take me Make me yours Do what they say Please! Please! I'm begging you
