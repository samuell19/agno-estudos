SIX O'CLOCK SHARP Happy birthday, Paula. One, two, three, four five, six, seven... One, two, three. Wow! What about the cream? - It is cream. - Hasn't it got any cream on it? Of course. All the white part is cream. I'm going to get the ice. That clock is slow. How's your mother? She's doing some shopping. Oh, in this rain! - How old is your mother? - In what? - In years. - Ah. - How old is she? - I don't know. Come on, Ignacio. Oh! It's tiny. What is it? - But it has a number. - Erm, let's see... What will it be? What will it be? What will it be? Ignacio. Hey, I told you I didn't want a present. But you have to put it on. How is it? Do you like it? Eh? What are you doing? Ignacio, what's happening? Paula, are you there? - Yes, but I'm fine. - That's a lie! You've deflated! It's nothing. Sing, Paula Ignacio, why don't you turn off the fan and go down to your house for a snack? - Are you cold? - No. - Can I look at you? - No. You're, you're... you're ashamed. Please! Leave me alone! There's nothing for you to do here. You'll get bored. - I can see a shoe. - Come on! - Come on! Get out! - No! - What are you doing? - Sing, you idiot! Ignacio! Ignacio! Stop! Leave me alone now! Get out of here, horrible brat! Get out! Did you hear me? Out! Hi mum. Hello, Ignacio. What are you doing up there?
