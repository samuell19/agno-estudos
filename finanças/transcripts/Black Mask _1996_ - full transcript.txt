Faced with an escalating war between Hong Kong's rival drug lords, the government launched Project 701, the creation of a biologically enhanced commando force. A serum injected into the nerve centers of the brain gave the 7O1 superhuman strength and an almost complete immunity to pain. There were side effects to the experiment. Some of the commandos became mentally unstable, and when one killed ten officers in a psychotic rage, the decision was made to abort the project and terminate all the 701s. Yes, I was one of them. The government scientists had taken away our sense of pain, of fear,our feelings, much of what it meant to be human. Now they wanted our lives. But our commander suspected what they were up to, and he enlisted me in a desperate plan to get the 701s out before the hammer fell. It's time to start the show. We'll skip the long good-byes. I'll keep them busy while you and the others get out. I'm the only hope you've got. And don't worry, Cailyn. If I don't get out with the rest, at least I'll have died on my own terms. Good-bye, Michael. Attention. You are in breach of security. Surrender and you will be escorted back to the research compound. Any action other than surrender will be dealt with by maximum force. Do the smart thing and give up. It's no use, Michael. Today is my 30th birthday. That means it's more than a year since that night when I last saw Cailyn and the Commander. I live in Hong kong with a new name and a new identity and a job at a library, something as far removed from my violent past as I could find. Sometimes I do wonder if any of the other 701s got out alive. But mostly I want to leave that life buried? and enjoy the peace I've found at last. [Woman sobbing] Tells me by email! That's Tracy. She works part time at the library. She's surrounded by all the classics of romantic literature-- Tracy, want to see something? ...and she still doesn't seem to have a clue. - The old guy is my boss. - Nothing in my sleeve, right? A little odd, but basically he's all right. He leaves me alone, and that's all I ask. I like it here. It's quiet. Nobody ever bothers a librarian. I almost feel like I'm getting the hang of living again. Tracy, don't you cry over him. The man was a prick, frankly. You really need someone who's going to be there for you, someone who knows you and cares about you as a person, someone like-- Hold on. You guys? No, no, no. I didn't mean us. Well, not exactly. You could do worse. Golly. Well, if you wanted to play around, you know, l wouldn't say no. Forget about it, all right? Hey, what about Simon? Simon? - Hi. - Hi. l know we're late for the meeting. Just tell the council we're on our way. They're waiting on us, Mr. Tai. Everyone's there except for you and King Kau. Think Kau might have been the one to break the truce? The man's a fruitcake. Come on. No way he's behind this. Whoever's murdering the drug lords is a real heavy hitter. l mean it. Not one of us is safe untill we find out who this motherfucker is and put him out of his misery. Mr. Tai, don't worry. We'll keep you safe. Check it out. Check it out. It's clear, sir. Holy shit. What the hell happened? An ambush. Let's go! Watch out! Get in here! Now! It's a trap! Can you hear me? What's going on out there? Where are you, you fucking idiots? Hey, it's your turn. It's strange that the one friend I've made since I got out would be a cop. They call him Rock on the force. A real hard-ass. We're different as can be. But we get along, maybe because we both Well? Are you going to move sometime before winter sets in? What's up? Problems with the case? No. Everything's fine. Just peachy. Bull. I heard that all these drug lord killings are making the police crazy. But I'm all for it. I think we should help these guys cut each other's throats. Take them all out. Hmm? Come on, Rock. That means you're no better than they are. I know why you're doing this. To throw me off my game. Kicked my ass again. Some pacifist you are. Well, you'll get the hang of it one day. Let's try it again. Okay, you start. And I'll play with my eyes closed. Wait. Come on. Let's play. Do you mind if I pee? Okay. You're coming back, right? Yo, Rock! The drug war between the Triads intensified today with the mass execution of over 100 men on Kwon Tong Pier. The lone survivor was reputed drug lord Ricky Tai. Where am I? Ambulance. You're on your way to the hospital. No. No. Something's wrong. - Easy, easy. - Mr. Tai-- Please, Mr. Tai. Lie down! Restrain him! Don't pull it away. - What is this? - Holy shit. - Who did that to his chest? - What the fuck did they do to me? Hold him down while I sedate him! [groans] God. My chest. The...pain. I'm gonna die. Hey, can you spare some money for the bus? I appreciate it. Thanks, buddy. Wow. Hey, you know, I could really use something to eat, too. How about it? Here. Happy to oblige. Jeez, man. That ain't much. Got any more? Mm-mmm. I'm sorry. That's it. This yours? - Yeah. - Yeah? Well, the hell with this stuff! Just give me the money, chump. - That's right, asshole! Give it to me! - Up against the fucking wall! - I gave you all I had already. - Check his pockets. - You won't find anything. - Shit, it's empty. - Where is your money? - Hey, what's so funny? You want to die? Hey, there. Hi. All right! You win! Okay, there, pacifist. Have you had enough yet? What? What are you saying? Slug the guy. Come on. You know you want to. I'm only a librarian, you know? And besides, what would it prove? Fuck, I don't know. Come to think of it, maybe you're right. Maybe we should just lie down and let these scumbags walk all over us. Huh. I'm out of here. See you. Rock...your watch! You're saying someone cut Ricky Tai open and stitched him up again? Yes, they implanted some sort of electronic device near his heart, directly below his left ventricle. That's no pacemaker. Get your nonessential staff out now. Clear the streets! Move everybody back! Excuse me. Where could I find Detective Rock? The hospital. - Can I help you? - Yeah. Where can I find Detective Rock? The hospital's off-limits. I'll have to ask you to move along. But, hey, this is important, really. Yeah, look, don't bust my chops, buddy. Move along, okay? No one gets in. I'm sorry. Get him up to surgery! Fast! Sutures...coming off now. Opening chest cavity. Steady, everyone. Foreign object under the left ventricle. I'll expose the ofyect. I'll have to sever these arteries. Wait! Those aren't arteries! Those are wires! Cut the wrong one and boom! If you can speed up his heart rate, that might help us distinguish between what's wiring and what's artery. All right, give me 50 CCs of adrenaline. Just how big is this one? With this much liquid nitrogen? Take out the whole floor. Now I'm going to separate the wires from the arteries and pair them off. We've got to cut them both at the same time, Detective. Ready when you are. Okay. Detective, sir! Commissioner's on the phone! He needs to talk to you right away! No, no. The bomb's been disarmed. Yeah, that's right. I'm pretty busy, Commissioner. - Rock, it's Simon. - Simon? What the hell-- Just listen to me! That bomb you're disarming uses a unique system of wires. How do you know? Never mind! Just don't cut any of those wires! - I already did. - Then get out of there. Get out? What do you mean? What's this all about, Simon? You've got less than a minute! Clear the building! Everybody out! - [Man] Move! Let's go! - [Man #2] Get everybody out! Go! Go! Go! Move! Simon, we need to talk. Okay, you gonna explain yourself or what? How do you know I was disarming a bomb? And all that stuff about the wiring, how do you happen to know all that shit? Hey, I'm talking to you. How do you even know I was at the hospital? Take it easy. They told me at the station where you where, okay? Wait a minute. When I heard about the bomb, I came here and did some research. Believe it or not, I've read about devices like that. You'd be surprised what you learn on this job. Tracy, I hate to break it to you. He likes boys, I think. Yeah, I think you're right. Gee, that's tough luck, Tracy. You finally fall for a guy who turns out to be a pansy. You're not jerking me around, are you, Simon? - I'm not asking as a cop, but as a friend. - [Tracy grunts] I won't stand for it! I don't know what your problem is, but I have this thing about being attacked from behind. Here, Rock. That book you wanted? Just watch it, okay? The bomb that killed Ricky Tai had all the earmarks of the 701s. So that meant that I wasn't alone, that some of the others must have escaped. And now they were making a move on the Hong kong drug lords. But why? If the 701s had turned to crime, it would be impossible for the police to take them down alone. Rock's life would be in danger. And only I could protect him. I didn't want to jeopardize this life I was just starting to get the hang of. So if I was going to help, I'd have to do it without Rock or anyone knowing my true identity. The only drug lord still alive was a lunatic known as king kau. He'd asked for a meeting with the police, so they sent Rock. What are you guys staring at, huh? Window shopping? Come on. Mr. Kau's waiting for you. Do you mind? Thank you. That's a nice look for you, Kau. You want to see what someone sent me today? These are my daughter's legs. She was only 6. Come here. Take a look around. Yeah, I've been getting a lot of gifts like these lately. Dad's in this one. And this one's got my mother in it. My kid brother-- well, most of him. They even sent along an empty bag for me. I threw it out. I think that was optimistic. So tell me what you want. I want protection. I got your protection. I want information. Who's been whacking the drug lords? Who's behind all this? Man, I have no idea. [Man] Sir, better come here. This guy is one sick son of a bitch. Jesus. Get her down. Hey! It was her fucking idea. I just met her last night. She's into this freaky shit. Is that right, miss? Uh-huh. Yeah. Is your phone ringing? No. Well? Whose is it? who's the dickhead who left his phone here? Go check it out. Hurry! Move it! You stay here, Mr. Kau. Let's go. Come on, you motherfuckers! You wanna play with the King? I think Kau's just setting us up, sir. Take it easy. What the hell is that all about? It's a fuse! Where's it going? Shit! The main box! Get out of the way! [Man] Jesus! What's going on? It's like a damn earthquake! Sir, I tripped! Come on, Tony. Aah! No one's at the wheel. I've got this. Look out! Watch your back! Where is the wheel? How do you stop this damn thing? There's a cop up there! Hold your fire! You're not scared at all, are you? You're really something. lt excites you, doesn't it? Oh, you're sick. And people say I'm fucked up. I had the key. Whoa! Yeah, baby, yeah. Aah! Cailyn. Michael. I'll never let you fall. Commander's ordered us to disengage. Hey! There he is! Whoa! Hey, hey, hey. Let's hear it for Detective Rock! I love the hat. How is King Kau, anyway? He's in intensive care. I've posted a 24-hour guard. I don't know who's after him, but they are good. Listen, there's something else, Detective. I didn't want to mention it before in front of your men. What the hell are you doing? Trying to make us look ridiculous? Wearing a costume and a black mask like something out of a comic book? You know, I've got reporters wanting to know if we're all getting cute new uniforms. Commissioner, wait a minute, sir. I don't know what you heard, but it wasn't me. Hang on, sir. Do you honestly think I'm the freak who was running around in that mask last night? Come on, sir. You know me well enough. Look me in the eyes. You know I'm a no-bullshit kind of cop, sir. Just lose the mask. Here's your coffee, Batman. Rock, I mean. I'm sorry, it just slipped out. Thanks for seeing me. So, what is it? Well, first off, you forgot and left your watch in the men's room. So that's where I left it. Thanks. That's the first good thing that's happended to me all week. I also wanted to ask you a favor, Rock. That girl you're holding for questioning, I know her. Well, that is, I used to know her. We lost touch. Then she called. She sounded scared. I'd like to help her if I could. Would you, now? I'm sorry. I know it's a lot to ask, But... would you let me see her, Rock? - Here she is, Detective. - Thanks. I'll handle the paperwork. He's waiting for you. Let's go. I was sure you'd find me if I let myself be caught. I knew you'd come back to us. Come back? No, Cailyn. It's your fate. No matter what you do, you're still one of us. If I told you there was a place for us outside of death, without all the killing, a place for us out here... that you and I could leave it all behind us just by walking away, would you do it then? Look, Michael, let's not pretend we're like these people. We are killers. But not machines. - Even a killer can choose not to kill. - [tires screeching] Hand the bitch over. Michael, I don't need you to save me anymore. What are you looking at? That's right. You broke my nose! That's nothing. You listen, asshole. Next time I'll shove that Mr. Clean head up your ass. Beat it. Simon, don't make a habit of this, all right? You through playing action hero? Done enough damage for one day? Come again. You're always bashing someone's head in. You know, there are other ways. Oh, sure, like bleeding to death. I'm only saying, to you, violence solves everything. I saved your ass. Come on. Don't blame me for your anger. Oh, pardon me for ever butting in, Gandhi! - You're shouting now. - Okay! Next time I'll let them kill you! In fact, I'll do it for them, you ungrateful son of a bitch! This is exactly what I mean! Is man God's mistake, or is God man's? The spinal column is severed. I'm afraid you're useless to us now. However, your blood we can reuse. We will survive. Don't abandon me, Commander. I'm sorry, son. Too many soldiers have died because of this damned experiment, and I fear more will fall before we have our reckoning. Get me our money man in Columbia. We're linked, sir. Inform them we're ahead of schedule and will proceed once payment is received. Yours sincerely-- etcetera. They're wondering why we've wiped out all of the drug lords, Commander. Always complaining. Well, I wonder if they really want the Crime Watch files after all. Or else they don't trust us. Tell them, if they're not careful, I might just double the price on them. Commander, they're threatening not to pay if we don't follow orders. Follow orders? Bullshit! If they don't want the files, we'll just sell them to somebody else. Tell them I've tripled the price. - They're thinking it over. - Of course they are. Just a question of calling their bluff. Now, onto other matters. This masked character could prove annoying. Do we have any idea who he is? It's Michael, sir. Really? Prodigal son returns. What wonderful news. How good it will be to have him back with us. Who says he's coming back? His destiny is with us. He'll come back. The lamb will return to the flock when he learns the truth that only I have the power to save him. - Yeah? - It's Tracy. I'm at the library. You've got to help me. - What? - Hurry! What? Tracy? [all] Surprise! - Smile! - # For... # # He's a jolly good fellow # # For he's a jolly good fellow # # For he's a jolly good fellow # # Which nobody can deny # Happy Birthday! Happy Birthday! - Cut the cake! - Blow out the candles! I read your file. I know it was kind of sneaky, - but I saw it was your birthday-- - You had no right. - You like it-- - Huh? I was going to give you this tomorrow. Huh. - I'm quitting. - What? Quitting? What do you want to do that for? Because I'm fed up. - What? - Fed up with what? Hey! Come back, Simon! Jeez, what a jerk. Yeah, Tracy, maybe he is perfect for you. - Simon, wait! - Hey! I'd already decided I had to quit now that the Commander knew that I was alive. I couldn't drag them into this. Now it was time to put this life behind me, just like I put the other life behind me. Hey, Simon! Hello! Hey, wait a minute, will you? Hey! Hold on! Okay. What was that all about? Just leave me alone. Wait! Your present. You might as well take it. I can't return it anyway. Thanks. Why not let me give you a lift? Because you'll never find a cab. No, thanks. I'm just asking if you want a ride home. - It's not like I'm gonna move in. - All right. Hurry. I'll drive. - But it's my car! - Just get in. Okay. What was that? Huh? - - A bit melodramatic, I admit. What the-- - What's happening? - Tracy, look! We need to talk, Michael. I know the reason you're here. Sorry, Commander. The answer's no. I'm out. You were always our angel of compassion. But you'd learn to hate our oppressors, if you knew the full extent of what they had done to you. Maybe if you knew that the serum they gave you not only granted you superhuman abilities but also shortened your life-- that without an antidote we're all doomed to die within a year-- maybe then you'd see your destiny lies with us! Commander, I'm afraid your destiny is a padded room. You're out off your mind. No, Michael. It's true. You'll die without the antidote, the same as all of us. I don't care. I'm through. One more chance. Think of what we could accomplish. Move in. Once I force the goverment to give us the antidote, there's no stopping us. Come on. Have it your way then, Michael. Aah! Let me go! Who are you? Stay away from me. Stay away or I'll start screaming! Let me go! Put me down! No! No! Wait! Not here! What are you gonna do? Please stop it! What do you want? - Don't be nervous. - No, wait! Don't! This ought to help. I'm sorry you stumbled into this. I've got to keep you here for your own good. Play a videogame if you get bored. If you get hungry... order in. I gotta pee! Commencing biodiagnostics. Beginning computer-assisted neural diagnostics. Scanning for physical damage or abnormalities undetected by sufyect. [laughing, grunting] They shot up a library. Can you believe it? Detective, they need to speak to you. There. Detective Rock? The chief librarian and the others are okay, but he says that two of his staff are missing-- a Tracy Li... and your friend Simon. I've been forced to ask International Crime Watch for their assistance in this investigation. Sir, I really don't think that-- They think foreign cartels are behind it, and I agree. Commissioner, we don't need Crime Watch looking over our shoulders. It's strictly a local matter. Let us handle it. I don't buy the foreign cartels angle. No way, sir. Look, King Kau is the key. Whoever's behind this will take another shot at him. That's where we should concentrate our efforts. Right. Is that all? Now, as I was saying, Crime Watch is more than willing to help. They're going to let us link up to their central database. Their most highly classified intelligence files will be downloaded to us. So I cannot stress enough the importance of security. All information coming into this precinct must remain here. They've made contact, Commander. They're downloading the files. Commander, we're getting it all. The police have no idea we've tapped their line. In 48 hours, the whole database, it's ours, sir. Once the Crime Watch files are in our possession, the government will be forced to deal with us. They give us the antidote, and we'll give back the files. Of course, not before we've made copies for the Columbians and all our other friends. Only one obstacle remains: Michael. Cailyn, it's up to you. Only you can get close enough to him. We must leave him to your charms. Isn't that dinner ready yet? Are you trying to starve me to death? Come on! Here. This stuff is real crap. It's not that bad. Let me cook. Damn! Oh. Don't worry. I've got it covered. Now turning to Hong Kong crime news, the police say that the true identity of the mysterious Black Mask remains unknown. He certainly isn't popular with the Hong kong police, but the man already has a fan club. Yeah, he's kind of hot. kind of sexy, right? That mask and the funky black hat? He looks like kato, the Green Hornet's sidekick. - [Male Reporter] I think it's obvious-- - She's right, you know. That Kato look is so retro. It's really out of date, you know. It perpetuates an ethnic stereotype. Really? Oh, wait. Simon. I totally forgot him. Poor Simon. Here I am thinking about myself. You know if he got away? Why, do you like Simon? Like him? He's a little quiet and weird, but cute. You think you could find him? Well, I can try. You know what I think? It's always the quiet guys that get the most done. They don't waste time talking. Hmm. Poor Simon. I hope he's all right. Sir, we've got a hacker! I know. I can read. "King Kau dies at midnight. The police are not to interfere." By the way, your buddy Simon just walked in. Where the hell were you? Oh, I was around. Uh-huh. And the girl Tracy? She's safe. You know, they shot up that library with enough bullets to stop a small army. Who do you think they were after, Simon? I don't know. You're the detective, Rock. They couldn't have been after me. I'm nobody. Maybe they were after this Black Mask person, or both of you. What do you mean? You know, Simon, this guy, people are calling him a hero. But that kind of vigilante justice goes against everything I stand for and against everything you stand for, I would have thought. Wait a minute. What is this? I thought you were the "kill them all, take no prisoners" kind of guy, Rock. Don't tell me I've changed your mind. I've been thinking. My father was on the force for over 22 years. Till he was gunned down one night. He used to tell me, "When Death comes knocking, nothing's going to stop him from coming in." "All you can do is meet him standing up with honor," he used to say. Think that means anything to a guy like the Black Mask? I'm sure it does. You're giving yourself away. Be careful now. I have nothing to hide from you, Detective. Not anymore. You know I could have you arrested. Well, I doubt it. Betray a friend? You never could. Incoming! Watch it! Watch it! No one's coming in. All right, keep on your toes. Unit 3, this is Unit 1. What's going on down there? Don't know yet. Hold it, who's this? Guy's critical. Look. Automobile accident. We've got to get him to intensive care. We've got a crash victim down here, Unit 1. Guy looks pretty bad. What should we do? This is Unit 1 . All right. Raise the gate and let him through. They were just admitting a patient. [Rock] All right. Everybody just stay cool. Hold your positions and stand by. fyot it? Now we're back to radio silence. Over and out. - Monitor's hooked up. - How's he doing? We're prepping him for surgery now. - He seems stable. - Right. - He's alive. - Here's another liter. [Woman] Heidi, you have that? Unit 1 to the ICU! Hurry! Yaah! Freeze! Jesus. [Rock] Say good night. [grunting] Hold it. I shot you full of sedative. It's over. Drop the gun! The gun's empty! Hold your fir! [panting] Don't make a move! Okay. Easy now. Now give me the gun. Give me the gun. There we go. It's all right. Just the drug taking effect. That's right. Everybody just stay calm. Fuck you. What the hell? Get back! Two by two! Go! Go! Go! Keep on down! Get us some damn backup in here! Drop it! You gotta be joking. So it's all about a girl. No, I'm saving a friend. Don't shoot! He's got Detective Rock! This guy's a walking bomb! Stay away! Okay, I've had it with you bald motherfuckers. - You okay? - Jesus, you all right, sir? There's a-- uh-- - Right there on your shoulder. - Huh? Think you can handle it? What is it? Evidence? I want a drink. Wait, I'll join you. Take it. Cailyn. Cailyn. Michael. You saved me again. That's from the Commander. He sent me to murder you. But this time I can save you if you'll just come back with me. There's more to life than just survival. I'd rather die than go back. You and I could start over when this is done. just like you said. Well, I have news for you, Cailyn. It's never done. Michael, it is done when we've made them pay. How do you propose doing that? Killing them all? Once we have got the Crime Watch files, they will do whatever we want them to. I guess we made a mistake. We thought we could save each other. Looks like we're both out of luck. Someone help! What's happened to you? Oh, my God. You're a mess. Get out. They're coming after me. You've got to get out. They'll be here any second. - Now where do we go? - Try down, bitch. Stay away, you witch! I've got you. Hang on! I've got you. I'll never let you fall. [Commander] Cailyn, is he dead? No, they escaped. Cailyn! Jump! Not so fast. You've lost a lot of blood. You've got to rest now. You know I'll have to kill you if you see who I am. Whoopsie-daisy. Well, maybe some other time. Seven cops dead. And a lot more to come. Unless you stop these people now, the bloodshed will never end. Okay, I'll play. You know all the answers. Who are these friends of yours? No, not friends. They're more like phantoms who need to be put out of their misery. These were my cops here, following my orders when they died. I can't stand here listening to you go on pontificating. See, those men of mine came this close to dying... for a reason. Then you let the girl go free. They died for nothing all because you interfered! Let me live with that. These people are stealing your Crime Watch files. This is a virus. Upload it into their computers. I don't know what you're talking about. I'm tired of this shit anyway. You want to put the mask on before we start? You'll just be wasting your time, my friend. It's pointless. You arrogant little prick! And there's only one of me. How do you fight a whole squad? Load this disk for me now. Just interrupt the feed. Without authorization, I can't-- Please. Yes, sir. They may be on to us. Trouble, sir. A virus, possibly. Break off contact before it corrupts our files. Hurry up! Detective, what the hell are you doing? Drop that gun! Sir, the same group that killed the drug lords is now stealing your Crime Watch files, you understand? If we don't stop this feed now, they'll have the whole database. Are you insane? Running around in here with a drawn weapon? This blatant disregard for the rules has gone beyond the limit, even for you. Now, I won't ask you again. Put down that gun. Do I have your attention now, sir? Easy now. Just stay calm. No, sir! It's the wrong time to stay calm. Uh-oh. No bullets. Silly me. Lunatic! I'll have your badge for this. I want you out of here now. You are suspended until further notice. - Yank the damn disk. - Yes, sir. What the hell? They pulled the virus. Everything's back to normal. Carry on. How could these guys bypass our security? Of course. They could if they were down in the basement. Tony, I know where they are. - I'm with you. - Come on, I'll show you. Here. But weapons release forms need the Commissioner's signature. [Rock] They certainly do. Jimmy, load us up, will you? Hey, who'd we just declare war on? [Rock on radio] Our computer linkup runs through a secure system below the building. The only way around it is by physically tapping into the lines. You gave him a radio? No. He's wearing a wire. It's planted in his watch. Does he know? No. - Hey, you all right? - Fine. - You're bleeding. - I am? It's nothing, sir. Really. Okay, tough guy. I think the main box is somewhere here. When did you come to us from Homicide, Tony? Going on six months. Must have served under lnspector Chan. - Yes, sir. - Nice guy. Real nice. - [gunshot] - [screaming] Chan died four years ago. And he was a real prick. You found us, Detective. Bad luck for you. Wait. - I'm going in there. - Not by yourself you're not. Don't be silly. You stay here. But why? Tracy, it's nothing personal. You'll just be in the way. No offense. Wait. Show me your face before you go. What for? You owe me your life? Keep it a secret. Promise me? Sure. Yes, of course. Be careful in there, Simon. Promise me you'll come back. Don't you worry. Hey! Wait till you see what we're having for dinner tonight! Commander, we're in the final stages of the download. What are your orders, sir? Everyone stays at his station. When the download's complete, we'll withdraw. Commander, we've got a security breach approaching Section C. Send a welcoming committee. Nothing. Just a lot of decoys, Commander. Sweep the area. Oh, finally. Glad to see you back with us. I even got you a welcome-home present. Surprise! I'll say one thing for you, you've got guts, as will shortly be apparent when you explode. Eat shit. Rock, how long? Stop talking and just kick the motherfucker's ass, would you? How long now? You're gonna have to be quick, or get the fuck out of here. - Got a pager? - Got a what? You never read that book I gave you, did you? Look, just get your ass out of here. Shit. What? Split up! Well, well. How could I have been so wrong about you? I thought you were destined for greatness, but now I see your destiny is to roast in hell with all the other rats who've betrayed us. My destiny? Who knows. But if it's hell, then you're coming along. I'm sorry, Michael. That journey you take on your own. I trained you well, but how much longer can you fight without breathing? Almost finished. If it makes it any easier to take, you would have been dead in no more than a year anyway. Give me that! Let's go. [Rock] Thanks for taking my friend along. Commissioner pulled some strings, and I'm glad to help. Don't worry, Tracy. I'll be back soon. Remember, you still owe me dinner. They say the antidote will make you a whole new man. Maybe next time I hit you... you'll stay down. Well, from now on, why don't we stick to chess? All right with you? It's time. So long. Wait. Just a second, okay? Hey, could you take a picture of us over there? Sure. No problem. [Commander] Soon you will do what you were designed to do. Die fighting. Teacher. You wanted to be a human. Now you can die like one. [Michael] Thank you. I'm on it. I'd rather die than live like you. [Commander] Have it your way, then, Teacher. I'm happy to oblige you.
