I move continuously, yet I'm still. I'm larger than life, yet do not breathe. Only in the darkness am I visible. You can see me but never touch me. I can speak to you but never hear you. You know me intimately, and I know you not at all. We are strangers, and yet you take me inside of you. What am I? CELESTE: Time is short. We have 90 minutes to find each other, to solve this riddle. You are borne in a beam of light. You move continuously, yet you are still. You are larger than life, yet do not breathe. Only in the darkness are you visible. I can see you but never touch you. You speak to me but can never listen. I know you intimately, and you know me not at all. We are strangers, yet I take you inside of me. (CHAMBER MUSIC PLAYING) (PEOPLE APPLAUDING) (MUSIC PLAYING) (HORSE NEIGHING) (MUSIC STOPS) (ALL EXCLAIMING) (PROGRESSIVE INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) CELESTE: I was born a genius. That's a fact. I knew what was what, right from the start. Then it was taken away. I am concerned with redressing the balance. Are you reconciled with your own history? Ruby? Do you know what it is? Ruby? Tell me everything you know. I remember very little. Why? 'Cause I've been kept in the dark. What? Those were the conditions. Which conditions? The necessary conditions for my existence. CELESTE: Only in the darkness are you visible. I know you intimately, and you know me not at all. - Oh, I can remember very little. - Why? Because I've been kept in the dark. Why? Those were the conditions. CELESTE: It's possible to remember anything that has ever happened to you. Perhaps even more. In the early days I was often to be seen tied to tracks and hanging from cliffs. I managed to be feverish, yet cool. Passioned, yet pure. Aloof, and yet (CHUCKLES) Totally available. And stranded, we were always stranded. "We"? RUBY: She and I. CELESTE: Your friend? Your sister? Your mother? (RUBY SIGHS) My mother, yes. My mother. My mother, yes, my mother. (MELANCHOLIC INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC) (MACHINES WHIRRING) Sir. I'd like to have some more information about these figures I'm typing. Can you tell me more about these figures that I'm typing? Can you tell me why this account is always the same? - You know what to do. - No... Just transfer these figures to the right-hand side. But I'd like to know... According to the information itself. I'd like to know more about it. I would like to know what's underneath it. Quite frankly, as an employee of the company, you're not being paid to speculate what this information may or may not be. All you do is transfer these figures onto the right hand side. Look. Do you think I'm stupid? I'd like to know what this is all about, that's all. Just do your job. SUPERVISOR: Do your job. CELESTE: I can see you but never touch you. I would like to see the Expert. The Expert... - Do you have an appointment? - Yes. Ah. (SHUTTER OPENING) Can I help you? I've just explained. I'd like to see the Expert. Ah. If you'll just wait over there for a moment. What is the purpose? I've been waiting. I want some information. Information? Information. Well, the information I'm trying to sort out concerns the movement... Ah! On the one hand, information, on the other, movement. That which moves cannot be outlined other than in terms of hypothesis. I was thinking specifically of... Ah, specifics. You are opposing the specific to the general. I must warn you that to assume that what you call specificity is anything other than an expression of confidence in certain unnamed generalities is a mistake. I agree. - You agree? With what? - You agree? With what? That it would be a mistake. The notion of mistake, which implies its opposite, that which is not a mistake, that which is correct, evokes one of the great and as yet unsolved questions of history. Which question? The question of essential truth. I want to talk about the movement of money. EXPERT: "I want". I want. How interesting. Which is more important, the possession of fact or the... - Possession of fact or the... - The fact of possession. All right, I'll give you unequivocal facts. Now, in the beginning a man gave a banknote to another man. This note was taken to a bank and exchanged for a pound of gold. The banknote was a promise, you see. Respected by all those who shared in the wealth of the country. People knew that our money had integrity. They knew that wealth must be pulled out of the ground, buried elsewhere and thereby put to work. They were happy for their resources to be realised, and relieved that their wealth was held in a proper store. But it doesn't live in stores. It keeps moving around. "Moving around"? Moving around what? Do you mean it revolves around some sort of centre? Or that it is centred on circulation? Or are we talking of a more metaphorical centre? Are we dreaming of money permanently at play around the perfection of gold? A perfection which has fathered it, but which it cannot attain. Gold, the great ideal, the perfect model. The articulation of beauty which has focused aspirations down the ages. It was the Golden Section which gave us our standards of spatial and architectural beauty. Our sense of proportion. It was the Golden Mean, counselling us to move with virtue between the extremes, which gave us our morals. And thus, civilisation. It was the legend of a Golden Age which gave us the vision of an ideal society. How many lives have been lost in the great quest? How many men made heroes? I know something moves, because I've seen it. What you have seen is only a shadow. Tell me what moves then? Do notes move? Notes are seasoned travellers, but they leave no traces. Does gold move? Gold moves when it shifts, but it has great power when it simply sits. What about the stuff in the ground? Well, like any subject it must be brought up. Brought up. Do promises move? Promises are "the" movers. Where do you fit in all this? I get my rewards. CELESTE: So how does gold really function in the world? As its blood. Just as blood flows through the veins of the body, so is gold the pure, bright blood of the earth. RUBY: I search for the secret of transformations. The breath. The fire. I search for the secret of my own transformation. (SCRAPING) Ruby. Ruby?

(PIANO PLAYING) Hello. Your things are over there. My things? Yes. I had to move them earlier. Sorry. Oh, that's okay. (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) How have you been? RUBY: Quite well, thanks. And you? All right. Mmm. A little cross with myself. In fact, I'm furious with myself! Despite years of research, I reach a certain point... ...and I freeze. It's getting late. Aren't you going to get changed? (STAMMERS) Yes. Yes, I suppose so. Have you forgotten? What? Live in the present, my dear. Don't dwell in the past. I can't remember what I'm supposed to remember. Have I been here before? Oh, nearly. What is it that goes wrong? It's partly since I decided to go solo. Some of the lifts are a little tricky. That's not it. Well, what is it then? Well, for one thing, until that moment in the sequence I haven't been facing the audience. And what happens when you face them? When I turn my head and catch their gaze, years of work expire in an instant. It's as though my feet didn't belong to me any more. And I forget, I forget my steps. (PIANO MUSIC PLAYING) You're on. You're on! (INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING) Oi. Oi! Oi! (MOUTHING) Yes. (LAUGHING) (AUDIENCE CLAPPING) Psst! (BOTH LAUGHING) (SIGHS) (ALL BOOING) (AUDIENCE JEERING) - Load of rubbish! Get off! - Off!

(GIRLS EXCLAIMING) (FAST MUSIC PLAYING) (ALL COUGHING) (HUMMING) CELESTE: You are borne in a beam of light. You move continuously, yet you are still. You are searching for a formula, Ruby. Well, I have one that explains a real loss. RUBY: What is it? CELESTE: In my job, money flows through my body, but every day I get less than I give. RUBY: Who is the richer? CELESTE: What I lose becomes a great surplus, and it is this that I am paid to move around each day but do not own. But I know that even as I look and even as I see, I am changing what is there.
