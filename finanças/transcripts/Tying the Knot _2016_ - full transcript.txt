(HIGH-PITCHED VOICE) Hi. I'm Kate McLennan. (HIGH-PITCHED VOICE) Hi. I'm Kate McCartney. We've both got family histories of dementia. Welcome to the The Katering Show Wedding Spectacular! (NORMAL VOICE) I don't think we're allowed to throw that. (NORMAL VOICE) Fuck 'em. Yeah, let's get out of here. This place is giving me the creeps. Yeah. It smells like sad books. (WEDDING MARCH PLAYS) Our fans are always sending us messages about weddings. "McLennan, will you bake our wedding cake?" "McLennan, will you do our catering?" "McCartney, will you marry me?" It's every girl's dream to get married. McCartney, what would your dream wedding be? To not have one. (BOTH LAUGH) What about you? Oh, look, mine will be filled with alcohol, people saying nice things about me, I wouldn't be there... Oh, no - that's my dream funeral. (BOTH LAUGH) Just kidding. I love a good wedding. Well, I don't, but our producers told us these episodes rate through the roof, so here we are. So, should we get cracking? Absolutely. We received a special email from an Anne Edmonds, who writes, "Hi, girls. Love the show." Everybody does, Anne. "I'm marrying my soul mate in a beach wedding in March." Oh! Good! I love a good wedding, Anne. "I know you two are very busy" - we are - "but I was wondering, would you ever consider..." No. "..creating a sit-down menu for my special day?" There it is. There we go. There it is. "I'd love canapes, an entree, a choice of three mains, "a dessert and a wedding cake, some vegetarian options, "a take-home treat, a cocktail for arrival..." OK, I think we've heard quite enough from you, Anne. We're not making any of that shit, Anne. We're making canapes, and that's it, alright? Sit-down beach wedding! It's not fucking Home and Away. I know. No-one wants to go to a sit-down wedding, Anne, where they're forced to talk to strangers for the evening, because the bride and groom have decided to mix everyone up like we're doing trust exercises at a holiday camp for young Christians. I'm a thirty-fucking-six-year-old woman, Anne. I don't want to make new friends. If anything, I want less friends, less people to disappoint. When I go to a wedding, I just want to relax and chat to one or two people online from the comfort of my own home. Let me tell you this, Anne. The only reason I'd want to sit next to a stranger at a wedding, is if that stranger wants to take me off to the toilets with a crisp 5 note, in which case, I'm more than happy to sit next to your recreational fisherman cousin from Yeppoon. But if not, we need to be up, we need to be mingling with the barman, who is sympathetic to the fact that we are at a wedding reception on a fucking boat! The last wedding I went to, the venue burnt down. Now, I didn't do it, but I can appreciate good work when I see it. Mm. Of course, the most common complaints about canapes at a wedding are that they're too small, there's never enough... And that I don't want to be there. So we're making big, main meal size canapes - so, large mini-burgers, large fish and chips. And a large mini-pancake with some salmon bullshit on top. If your guests are still feeling a bit hungry, they can bring along a bag of snacks or, I don't know, follow their instincts and leave. Just kidding, Anne. (CHUCKLES) I...love a good wedding. So here are all the ingredients for Anne's beach wedding canapes. McCartney, you're a 35-year-old woman. Sure. How many weddings do you think you've been to? Oh, not many, 'cause my friends are poor and gay, and also, I don't have friends. You? Oh, I've been to heaps. Yeah, my friends and family haven't let the issues of marriage equality and compatibility get in the way of procuring a set of French gift registry knives. Oh, that's nice. Yeah, they're really great...knives. (SPRAY CAN HISSES) I do love a good wedding, but personally, the only benefit I can see to having a wedding is all the attention that you get. But you can also get that from shoplifting. Yes, plus you get to wear a nice dress, but again, you can also get that by attending a formal dinner for an Iraqi head of state, or by winning an award - say, Australia's premiere entertainment award, the Gold Logie. I know which one I'd choose. But some people - like you, Anne - genuinely love the idea of dropping 20 grand on a party held at a beach that was, until recently, a designated crime scene, because it makes them really happy. I mean, it doesn't make us happy, but don't take your cues from us. I wish my cat had a phone so I finally had someone to text. And I fantasise about getting sick enough to go to hospital, just so I can have a little bit of a rest. Point is, we're not a good gauge. McCartney, what makes you happy? NCIS. You? Oh... Oh, gosh, I know this. Um... Oh, um... Now, McCartney isn't negative about marriage just because she has a dark cloud hovering above her person. She's also a bisexual - isn't that right McCartney? Yes. Thanks, McLennan. And it seems insane to me that half of me is allowed to get married whilst apparently the other half isn't. Yeah, that must be hard, particularly if you want to marry maybe a close female friend, or a coworker, but you can't, because it's forbidden. It's forbidden love... Not in love with you. Yeah. Yeah, no, yeah. Yeah, you... We should keep things professional. You're right. Now, where is that dill? Where is that dill, guys? Does anyone know where that... Where's...where's it... Where's it gone? This is creme... This is creme fraiche. Fraiche? Fresh? Fraiche? Fraiche. This is creme fraiche. Today, I'm reviewing a typical wedding drinks list - flat beer, cheap domestic sparkling, Sauv Blanc in a dirty glass, and a red wine blend that will make you flirt with your cousin. Just remember the drink mixing rules - never drink champagne after beer, never drink red wine with an aunt who's defriended you on Facebook, and never drink whisky, because you will pick a fight with a five-year-old called Corey who's getting more attention than you on the dance floor, even though he's not a better dancer, he's just wearing a little tuxedo and he has a cochlear implant. Whatever, Corey. If you're going to mix your drinks, just be literal about it. Mm. Well, that tastes like a chemical burn, but you will be out cold by the speeches. I give that nighty-night cocktail five "what happened to the bride? She used to be normal. "She used to be my friend. "Oh, that's right - she married a cock" out of five. Where are you going? I'm done. The tablecloths are pressed, the candles are lit, and some plastic furniture has been dressed in white - a beautiful nod to the bride's hymen. Yes, we've reached the end of the The Katering Show Wedding Spectacular. I am convulsing with sorrow. Me too, because I've said it before and I will say it till I'm literally dead - I love a good wedding. Right, let's serve up the food. Mmm, it's delicious, and plenty of it. Good luck, Anne. I mean, really, genuinely, good luck with your wedding and making your marriage work. Yeah, good luck, you heteronormative piece of shit. Captions by Ericsson Access Services So, I know about scissoring, but what's some other lesbian stuff that you do? Ponytailing. What's that? It's when you use your ponytail. Oh. Oh, look at you. You scrub up. Yes, I look famous. OK, I'm ready. Right. OK. And the winner of the Gold Logie, beating Carrie Bickmore for the fourth year running is... (GASPS) ..Kate McCartney! Ohh! (HUMS SHOWBIZ AWARD SHOW MUSIC) Wow! Thank you! Mwah! Mwah! Thank you so much, everyone. I'd like to thank my cat Beans, uh, my phone, baking soda, the rats in my walls of course, komodo dragons, and I couldn't have done it without McLennan's amazing spare phone charger. Thank you so much. Thank you, guys. World peace, yes? Yes. (RESUMES HUMMING) You'd have to wash your hair a lot, wouldn't you? Get oily.
