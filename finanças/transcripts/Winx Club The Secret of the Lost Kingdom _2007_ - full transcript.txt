Episode 6 Tomorrow, King Daeso's retinue shall pass this point. As we expected, the king is heavily guarded. We'll be heavily outnumbered even ambushing them. We shall attack as planned. Ohh... You're still not sleeping. Yes. I can't catch sleep. Is it fear? Yes. I'm a little scared. Then, you can always go back home. No. I am scared, but I shall fight. Your Highness gave me a dream. When I was trapped inside those caves drawing murals, my dream was to come out and see the world. I didn't know what to do, or why. I just wanted to escape that place. But, after seeing you, I finally learned what I shall do, and what I should live for. You taught me I had a country to love, and to live for. Seeing those Goguryeo people taken to Buyeo... for the first time in my life, my entire body was trembling with anger. I was scared back then, just like now. But that burning anger gave me courage. Anger becomes the will to fight, and strengthens you, I agree. But people can't live off anger alone. There's something much more powerful than anger. What is that? You shall find out what that is, and understand it yourself. Take this. If you shoot arrows with this, as if hearing a roaring lion, the troops shall heed your command on the battlefield. His Majesty gave it to me on the day of my first battle. Ahh... something so precious, how can you give it to a miserable fool like me? No, you deserve it. It will be a difficult battle, but you need to survive. If you survive this, I shall teach you how to use that. Your Majesty! We shall stop our march. What is the matter? The troops who left us yesterday for a reconnaissance mission still have not returned. Surely something must have happened to them. Until we ascertain their whereabouts, we shall stop our march. We will immediately depart. But, Your Majesty. This is Hwangnyong territory. It's a most insidious place, considering rebel forces haven't been suppressed. If I stop the march merely to avoid innoxious dullards like them, what would become of me? If we stop the march now, we will not arrive at the Jipaehyeol ceremony by the appointed date. Is matching that appointed date as important as His Majesty's safety? I said I shall be responsible for His Majesty's protection. We shall proceed as planned. Let's move! They're coming. Get ready. It's an ambush! Protect His Majesty! Protect His Majesty! Move His Majesty's carriage! Your Highness! Retreat! Your Highness! They're after us. Get moving! Continuing this way will put His Highness's life at risk. We shall take care of those troops, so go find refuge, Your Highness. - Muhyul, Maro, Chubalso! - Yes. You escort His Highness. Yes. The enemy troops are here! Hurry up! Your Highness, endure it just a little longer! Chief Decorator! Muhyul and Maro are back. Your Highness! Your Highness! Your Highness! How are you feeling, Your Highness? Muhyul. Yes, Your Highness. Head for the capital right now. Go and tell His Majesty that King Daeso is dead. If you use this, you will be able to seek audience with His Majesty. No matter what, you need to tell him. Don't worry. I shall tell him at all costs. Gungnae Fortress I have a message from His Highness Prince Haemyeong. I need to see His Majesty. Hey, you fool. I have been guarding these gates for over a decade, and I have never seen messengers with such garments before. Get out of my face! Will you trust me now? What did His Highness send you here for? My apologies. Before I am allowed audience with His Majesty, I can't tell anybody. You, listen! Do you know who you're speaking to? I'm the Chief of Security protecting His Majesty. Without my consent, nobody can seek audience with His Majesty. Go ahead and tell me. You... Follow me. He's a messenger sent by His Highness. What did Haemyeong send you here for? What are you doing? Tell His Majesty. Leave us alone. But, Your Majesty. He says he's a messenger sent by His Highness. But... if he has other intentions... Leave us. Come closer. Here, you can speak to me now. What does Haemyeong have to tell me? King Daeso... is dead, Your Majesty. What are you saying? His Majesty slayed him... on his way to Hwangnyong. Are you telling me the truth? Yes, Your Majesty. I saw him perish myself. Do you know the reason for this urgent gathering, Daebo? I don't know myself. Seeing that they assembled us in secret at this hour, it must be a momentous matter. Your Majesty. What is the reason behind this sudden gathering? What I am about to say shall remain confidential. Not only every chieftain of the Council, but you shan't reveal it even to the troops under your command. Haemyeong sent me a messenger from Jolbon. What he revealed to me was... that Haemyeong killed King Daeso, while on his way to Hwangnyong. Your Majesty! If that is indeed the truth, shouldn't we notify the Council and prepare for war? If King Daeso perished, a full campaign against Buyeo... could have significant chances of success. I shan't tactlessly deploy troops simply because of a messenger's words. Sangjanggun*. {\a6}*Highest ranked position in the Central Guard, equivalent to "Commander-in-chief" Yes, Your Majesty. Reinforce border defense right now. If anything truly happened to King Daeso, Buyeo shall be the first to throw the gauntlet. Yes, Your Majesty. Daebo. Yes, Your Majesty. Alert our spies in Buyeo, and order them to... investigate the authenticity of King Daeso's death. Yes! Did Prince Haemyeong really kill King Daeso? It's the word of a messenger sent by His Highness, but we can't verify if it truly happened. If King Daeso really perished, King Yuri will wage war against Buyeo, and his victory will empower his stout-hearted authority. If that truly happens, your longtime dream of building a country for our Biryu clan... will crumble in an instant. If the Council vetoes engagement, wouldn't King Yuri be trapped? Your judgment is wrong. If King Daeso did indeed die, without any support from the chieftains, King Yuri shall engage Buyeo with the Central Guard alone. Even if it's the Central Guard, they are a mere twenty thousand men. Are you telling me he will attack Buyeo with those troops? Buyeo strengthened itself through King Daeso's absolute power. Without Daeso, they will meet their downfall in a matter of moments. So the Central Guard of Gungnae Fortress alone... might pose enough of a threat to have chances of success. Send a message to Baegeuk. Tell him to probe Buyeo's reaction to start with. Yes. I brought him, Your Highness. Is it true Haemyeong killed King Daeso? Yes. Where is he? Why didn't he come to the capital? His Highness was seriously injured, and is undergoing treatment. A lot of people are taking care of His Highness, so don't worry, Your Highness. Let's go see him together. I shall see him first hand. Pardon me... But I'm waiting for His Majesty's orders. I need those orders to return to Jolbon. We declared war on Goguryeo. From this moment, every Black Shadow shall be in a state of emergency. Make all the preparations to deploy immediately as we receive orders. Understood? Yes! A full campaign against Goguryeo?! What is going on? On his way to Hwangnyong, His Majesty... was ambushed by Goguryeo troops. What?! His Majesty and the wesaja... surely suffered some injuries. I need to go there. Yeon. I need to see what happened with my own eyes. I will follow you. Gong Chan. What is going... Let's pack our bags right now. What is it, again? Buyeo just declared war on Goguryeo. Ahh... suddenly, why? On his way to Hwangnyong, King Daeso was killed by Goguryeo troops. If we don't get out of Buyeo right now, we'll become dead meat. - The workers and slaves? - Just get the money. It's a message from the Sangga. Is anything wrong? Haemyeong killed King Daeso. The reason he was training mercenaries was to kill King Daeso?! Still haven't heard anything from Muhyul? Nothing. There is something I need to ask you. The relationship between Your Highness and Muhyul. I'd like you to explain to me what it is. Seeing his towering skills even surprised me, and I wonder why Your Highness always pays special attention to him. Muhyul... is a Goguryeo prince. He's my younger brother. When Muhyul was born, the sorceress had a revelation telling us Muhyul's fate... was to cause Goguryeo's downfall. She said the only way to break heaven's curse... was to kill that child. But His Majesty... couldn't slay his own flesh and blood... And, as if depriving him of any authority, abandoned him. That is how you were entrusted with Muhyul's custody. Then... Does Muhyul need to live like this for the rest of his days? He doesn't. Muhyul has grown into a prodigious young man. So, when the time comes, I shall at all costs... reinstate his status as prince. That day is no longer far off. Your Majesty. His Highness's messenger seeks audience. Let him in. What is it that you need to tell me? It has been over five days since I conveyed my message. But why is Gungnae Fortress so placid? His Highness risked his life for this golden opportunity. Are you going to squander all his efforts this way? How dare you show His Majesty such impudence?! Come closer. Do I look incurious about this? Yes. I still can't believe that King Daeso has been killed. But, Your Majesty. I saw him perish myself. I am your King, entrusted by heaven with protecting our people's lives. I shan't put their lives at risk for a mere misjudgment. Therefore... I am verifying if what you are saying, whether King Daeso was killed, really is the truth. I shan't beguile the Crown Prince's fealty for this, so you may leave. Seeing that boy's dauntless and doughty disposition... reminds me of Your Majesty's youth. It's a relief the Crown Prince has such faithful servants at his side. Your Majesty. We got word from our spies in Buyeo. Buyeo troops are moving to the border. Immediately summon the Council. Yes. What happened? Did King Daeso really perish? Something happened to King Daeso, for sure. Buyeo troops have been deployed to the Goguryeo border. Sangganim. What is the matter? King Yuri has summoned the Council. What can we do now? I hereby... declare war on Buyeo. Many of you chieftains have already recanted your renitency on the matter. But, whether you remonstrate or not, my steps towards a full campaign shall be resolute. Your Majesty! Without the chieftains' resolve, you can't mobilize our troops. Why do you wish to engage in a war without hopes of success? We can win! Prince Haemyeong... slayed King Daeso. I repeatedly verified its authenticity. Sangga. Yes, Your Majesty. How will you react? I received reports of King Daeso's situation myself. I shan't refuse waging war when we have chances to win. The Biryu clan shall therefore bestow Your Majesty... with thirty thousand troops complete with munitions and supplies. They have decided on the campaign. Is that true? Sure, you fool. Anyhow, I laud your efforts. Goguryeo border Let's take a closer look. That... That is the flag of the Royal Guard. Wouldn't it be strange for them to be here, when King Daeso is dead? That is King Daeso. King Daeso is alive! Head for Gungnae Fortress, and convey my words to King Yuri. If he doesn't slay Prince Haemyeong under my eyes, I shall slaughter every soul in Goguryeo. Yes, Your Majesty. Your Majesty. Yeon and Dojin are here. Your Majesty! You've come along, Dojin. I am so relieved you weren't seriously injured. I had heard you were fatally injured by Goguryeo troops. Do you feel any pain? Those harebrained Goguryeo mooncalves... slayed my shadow, thinking they killed me. I am just fine, so you needn't worry. How is the Black Shadows' training camp? Every Black Shadow is on high alert, preparing for our engagement against Goguryeo. Wesaja. Yes, Your Majesty. We shan't expose the Black Shadows for this campaign, so deploy them with utmost prudence. Yes. What is going on? I really thought His Majesty had perished. What does His Majesty imply, saying they killed his shadow? To safeguard His Majesty, the Chief Retainer... prepared a lookalike of His Majesty. It was enough to surprise even me. Beware of the Chief Retainer. He defiles His Majesty's grace when he's next to him, and one day his viperous dagger of betrayal shall pierce yours truly. I shall bear it in mind. Have a word with the Chief of Security, Your Highness. His Highness is waiting for me. Didn't His Majesty tell you he'll leave to meet him with you, whenever deployment procedures are completed? I shall escort His Majesty to meet him, so be a little more patient. {\a6}*Deferential version of "Nuna" (older sister) Nunim*! What a sight, you in armor. I gained His Majesty's consent to join the campaign. I am awaiting your tutelage, Nunim. Fine, let's head for the military training camp. Bring us sticks. You shall have it. Teach Prince Yeojin a few moves. How could I... You're telling me I should learn from a servant? You shall teach me, Nunim. You think your foes on the battlefield will be concerned about your noble birth? You shall bear in mind even a slave could slay you. No need to hold back because he's a prince. What kind of training is this going to be if you act like that? Attack him as well! Stop right now! Mother! What on earth are you doing?! This lowly scum is showing contempt for Yeojin. Are you just going to remain here staring at them?! Mother. It's something I asked for. What on earth are you doing? Have you taken a look at yourself? What are you waiting for? Escort the Prince to his residence! My apologies. It's not your fault. I shall take the Central Guard and Biryu troops, and head for Pyeongcheon Plains. {\a6}*River between Liaoning and Jilin Province feeding Hunjiang River, which feeds Yalu/Amnok Sangjanggun, you cross the Biryusu* and attack from the north. Yes, Your Majesty. Your Majesty! What is the occasion, Lord of Jolbon Fortress? Your Majesty, halt deployment procedures! What is that supposed to mean? King Daeso is alive. I verified that first hand, Your Majesty! I hope you enjoyed a most salubrious time, Your Majesty. Goguryeo people believe Prince Haemyeong slayed His Majesty Daeso. Does Your Majesty believe the same? The man Prince Haemyeong killed was nothing more than a lookalike. For His Majesty's sake, we used a lookalike on our recent retinue to Hwangnyong. We call him the Shadow Emperor. What Prince Haemyeong killed was merely His Majesty's shadow. His Majesty has already passed the Goguryeo border. His Majesty orders you to take Prince Haemyeong, and behead him right under his eyes. If his wish is not appeased, every man and woman in Goguryeo shall be slaughtered. Your Majesty! What is going on? What's happening?! Buyeo troops! Turn the carriage! Hurry up! Get moving! We can't take the carriage with us! Right? Right. What are you going to do with this money when you're dead? My money! My money!! Hurry up. Buyeo troops have occupied the Namso* and Gusan* fortresses, {\a6}*Ancient Goguryeo walled cities in present day Tonghua, Jilin Province and reached Pyeongcheon Plains already. For every village they occupy, they leave a trail of flames and slaughter behind their advance. The responsibility for this tragedy shall be His Highness's. We shall capture Prince Haemyeong, and offer him to King Daeso in penance. I heard the messenger Haemyeong sent is still in the capital. Capture him right now! Get him! What happened? Where is Haemyeong's messenger? We lost him. You inutile... Get the troops and go find him! Yes! That is impossible. I saw King Daeso die with my own eyes. What you and Haemyeong killed was a lookalike, and nothing more. Go to him right now. Tell him everything, and find refuge. Find refuge?! Why should His Highness find refuge? They're going to blame all of this on Prince Haemyeong. If the chieftains learn of his retreat, it could be very dangerous for him. Go, now. What happened to His Highness's messenger? He has already escaped the palace. Then, we shall have no way of finding His Highness's retreat! Yes. But he will not have gone far, Your Majesty. I shall take some troops and look for him. No need. Your Majesty! If the chieftains find out where His Highness is hiding, his life shall be in peril! We need to move him to a safer place. Does a safe place really exist in Goguryeo right now? Seeing how he refused to tell the Chief of Security about their hideout, he's a very judicious and clever boy. You needn't worry. Muhyul! What happened? Did you meet His Majesty? Does His Majesty recognize our efforts? His Highness? His Highness?! He's inside. What... did you just say? King Daeso is alive. The man we killed was an impostor, disguised as King Daeso. I shall head for the capital. You can't! You need to find refuge here, Your Highness! In this situation, how can I run away?! King Daeso has deployed his army, and already crossed the border. The chieftains are trying to blame all of this on Your Highness. What Muhyul said is right. Until we learn more about this situation, stay here. If anything happens to you, I shall be engulfed by guilt my entire life. I was the one who found out about King Daeso's trip to Hwangnyong. Because of me... Your Highness... fell into this crisis. Nonsense. It's my fault, for falling into their trap. Your Highness. I shall bring the General and the Chamgun here. Please, think of your safety for now, Your Highness. What is the reason you came here? There is something I need to entrust you with. Gong Chan! Come in. How about it? She still might be coarse, but is a most prodigious specimen. Sangganim. These bedraggled garments and my carcass are all that remain of my fortune. If you open your hands in abetment just this once... I shall give you... five hundred nyang. What?! You needn't give me that wench. Use her for your business endeavors. Just tell me what I shall do for you. I want Haemyeong. King Daeso has already passed the border... and is marching past Pyeongsan Plains, you should know well yourself. If we are to bring an end to this crisis, we are forced to bestow Prince Haemyeong on King Daeso. It is the only way to bring matters to an end. You surely could guess where Haemyeong might be enjoying refuge as we speak. If you can bring Haemyeong to me, I shall munificently fund your riposte back into business. Follow me. Chamgunnim. Where is His Highness? Hye Ap! It's been too long, my dear. What is the occasion? I came to see His Highness, what else? His Highness?! Why did you come here, then? Don't do that. It's Mahwang you're speaking with. There is no uncharted matter for me when it comes to His Highness. I wasn't followed, so placate your fright. I shall confer with His Highness about most important matters, so bring me to him! Your Highness! I shan't leave this unsufferable weight on His Majesty's shoulders, and hide in cowardice. I shall take responsibility for everything I caused. And, if mischance should befall me, I shall entrust Muhyul to you. If he one day escapes from the calamitous flames of adversity, Muhyul shall rule this country. So you shall shelter him with utmost devotion. Words of remorse are all I can leave you with. The only thing burning inside my heart... was my love for you, Hye Ap. Chief Decorator. Where is His Highness? Chief Decorator! Chief. Did anything happen? His Highness... left for Gungnae Fortress. Didn't you know the Council is ready to offer you as sacrifice? Why did you come? I put you and Goguryeo in peril, so I shall offer my life in atonement... and take responsibility. What father would sacrifice his own flesh and blood... to preserve the crown he's wearing? What father would harm his own son to protect himself? Abandon me... and protect our people! {\a6}*Yuri's first son Dojeol was to be sent to Buyeo as hostage, but he refused and suddenly died; You are telling the man who abandoned your brethren*... to abandon even you? {\a6}some historians speculate it was Yuri's retaliation for Dojeol's refusal and opposition to moving the capital I cannot do that. Father! I endured countless humiliations, waiting for the day... I will take that acrimonious dagger piercing my soul and stab Daeso with it. I trust if I cannot achieve that goal, you shall one day do it for my sake. If you don't abandon me, all our people will perish. Send me to King Daeso! You fatuitous man. Can a crown prince so easily wish for his demise? You shall survive. I shall bear all the blame for this. If I can dispel this crisis with my blood, quench my vengeful thirst for your father's sake. Father! Main Translator & Timer: MisterX Timing QC: julier Editor/QC: thunderbolt Coordinators: mily2, ay_link We can't avoid the matter any longer. Isn't there a very quick way to stop their advance? Are you telling me to offer my son in sacrifice once again? His Highness went to Gungnae Fortress. He can't go. Can't you see this blood? This is the blood His Highness shed. Our Highness, the Crown Prince! - Crown Prince?! - Know how long I waited for this day? What are you saying? His Majesty went there?! His Majesty will never agree to send you as sacrifice. Send the Black Shadows to kill Yuri. Stop! Father. - The blood I shall shed today... - You can't! - will stop... - I said you can't! - I... - Haemyeong! shall meet you again in the netherworld. Haemyeong! If it weren't for this, the arrow would have pierced your heart. I shall pay them back for everything!
