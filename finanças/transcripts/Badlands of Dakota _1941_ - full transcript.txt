Me washee horsee. You likey starchy too? Ladies and gentlemen, tonight you're gonna see the best darn show that Bob Holliday has ever presented or the best show that I ever rang our curtain up on as long as I been master of ceremonies at the Bella Union. First, I want you to meet those two little girls, the Anderson Sisters, two of the best high-kickers I ever seen. Give 'em a sample, girls. That's enough! [laughing] [men cheering] I knew you'd like it. I knew you'd like it. Now I want you to meet the triple trio, Mary, Belle, and Lou, those girls with the golden voices. Give 'em a sample, girls. -On me. -One, two. That's enough girls, don't give 'em too much. -[audience laughing] -[audience applauding] And now for the final, I want you to meet the Johnson brothers, two of the fastest men with Indian clubs not to be Indians I ever looked at. Give them a sample, fellas. That's all, that's enough. [all laughing] [audience applauding] Don't forget, curtain's at seven o'clock. [voices clamoring] -You must be awful brave. -Oh, it's all in a day's work, all in a day's work. Here, here, here, the minute I turn my back on you, what happened? I was just tellin' the girls about the Albion I was playing. We rescued all those beautiful girls. Oh, what a beautiful fire, beautiful fire. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He starts more fires than he puts out. Oh, you're only jealous of me, only jealous. Jealous, me? That was Fire Chief Alarmy. -What do you mean? -[voices clamoring] Boys, boys, break it up. [voices overlapping] Do me a favor, will ya? Deal 'em off the top this time. I'll learn you, you young squirt. Get out of here. Go on, get out. Oughta throw you out with him. Look at you. Why should I bother with a gun when everyone's afraid of my brother? Yeah, well someday you're gonna run into a real tough guy and when he gets through with you, you won't be able to hold your liquor. Speaking of liquor, bartender, some service. There you are, the finest service in the West. You wanna know after six months if things are different in Deadwood. Where men live with their collars off and die with their boots on. Here's the Deadwood, a town with hair on its chest. [Jim coughing] What's the matter? What is this stuff? Oh, that's an old Indian drink made from wild plums. The Indians take the plums, they put it in a blanket, squeeze the juice out, and cook it over a hot fire for half an hour. Forgot to take the blight out of this batch. [bartender laughing] What's the idea? Two drinks of that and you'll really get in trouble. Always mind your big brother, kid. That's the best way to keep your health around here. Friend or customer? Oh, hi Jack. I understand you still have to wash behind his ears for him, huh Bob? [men laughing] Now I remember you, Jack McCall. They almost hung you for cattle stealing last month. All right, Rocky, I'll handle this. Sorry you're in such a hurry, Jack. Stop in again sometime, will ya? Come on, Jim, I want to talk to you on the office. Well, what do I have to do? Stand in the corner for a half hour. Jim, I want you to do something for me. I'm gonna send you a back to St. Louis St. Louis? Yeah, I know it's not New York, but you'll get a lot of things around there you miss here. -You going along? -I won't be able to, that's why I'm gonna send you. Sure you're not just trying to get me out of this bull bad town. No, you'll be coming right back. Jim, You remember Anne Grayson? -Anne Grayson? -Yeah. Sort of, big eyes, pigtails. Kiddie legs. She used to have an uncle rode Pony Express, didn't she? That's right. He used to tell Anne and me stories about the Indians and the Badlands and the mountains. He's the one that got me interested in the West. -Funny that. -Least it's profitable. Yeah. I've made mine and I want to settle down. And well, you see, Jim, when I left St. Louis, I, uh, well, I, uh, told Anne I'd send for her. Why, you old son of gun. And I didn't even suspect it. Only she was just a kid. She's 22 now. She's still in love with ya? Well, there's no reason for her to be, but judging from her last letter. All right. All right, I know the answer. When do you want me to go? There's a stage leaving for Fort Pierre tomorrow. You'll take that and take the boat on down from there. Jane. Hello, Jane. Whoa! -[whip cracking] -[man shouting] Why-- Hiya, Jane. [chuckling] Next time, call your shot, huh? [Jane laughing] How's the road to Pierre? It's a little muddy, but you can make it all right. Little muddy, huh? [voices clamoring] I'm too dry to talk now. -Barkeep! -Okay. One schooner coming up on a full sail. Well, what's the news from Chicago? As far as I know, it's still burnin'. Yeah, if I'd have been there, they wouldn't have had any fire. I bet you would have shot Mrs. O'Leary's cow the day before it kicked over the lantern. Well, what's the cow got to do with the fire? -Anybody can put a cow out. -Where's Bob? He's in the back room there, but he's very busy now. He's never too busy to see me. [upbeat music] -[boot kicking] -[coins jingling] Oh no, this is that button now. Woo-hoo, Just picked 'em up and gonna bring 'em to ya. Here. [coins clinking] Oh, here come more that you forgot. [boot kicking] Hiya, boys. Jane, when did you get in town? Few minutes ago. Just hit the jackpot, so I'm buyin' the drinks. Busy now. Oh, now a lady don't enjoy drinking by herself. We sitting together at the show tonight? Maybe. You goin' home to change your clothes? Don't you ever wear dresses anymore? Not unless I have to. It makes me feel too darn effeminate. Here, this oughta cover all the expenses. -Say, what about her? -What about it? There's nothing between Jane and me. We kicked around together. Sure, I know. She's been a scout for General Custer. She's ridden over half the West. Don't get excited, boys, don't get excited, but the place is burning down. [voices overlapping] Somebody must have thrown a cigar. Wait, wait, wait. I'll take care of it. Leave it alone, I'll take care of it. Oh, you're just in time for the fire. Go ahead. Don't get excited. -It's all right. -[whimsical music] Oh boy, am I in a pickle. Everything is okay here, everything's all right. Don't be alarmed. I'm right here. Coming through, coming through. Everything's all right. Don't worry, folks. [bell ringing] What this town needs is a new fire chief. What are your talking about? The fire chief's the best bartender in town. [all laughing] -[upbeat music] -[voices clamoring] How many times have I told you not to interfere with my fires? It makes a man very mad. Well, what are you gonna do about it? [water splashing] [voices clamoring] [all laughing] [upbeat music] Whoa. Only be a few minutes. -Yes, sir. -I hope. Afternoon, sir. Does Miss Anne Grayson live here? Yes sir, step right in. Who will I say is calling, sir? Jim Holliday. Yes, sir. Won't you please sit down? Thank you. [footsteps descending] Hello. I'm waiting for a Miss Anne Grayson. I'm Anne. Don't you remember me? Oh, well it has been ten years. And I thought that only butterflies. [Anne laughing] -So you're Anne? -Yes. Won't you come in here where we can sit down? How's Bob? Oh, he's all right. Big man out West. You mean I won't have to do my own washing? Not exactly. Tell me what it's like in Deadwood. Well, it's kind of a combination of things. You certainly paint an exciting picture. Oh, but you don't have to tell me, I know. Indians, miners, life in the wrong. Oh, the frontier. I'm gonna love every moment of it. I see you read a lot. Oh I do, everything I can find about the West. You see when, Bob and I are married, I want to be able to help him in the work he's doing. Yes. Yes, I see what you mean. Is that you, Holliday? You remember uncle Wilbur? Oh, of course. -How are you, sir? -Well, I reckon you never forgot all them stories I told ya. Oh, I think that was my brother, Bob, sir. Yes, siree. I bet you it was them stories that started you heading for the West. I said it was my brother. Ah, another? Oh, sure, sure. I got lots of them. Say, I'll tell ya about the first time I headed for Fort Latimer. Please Uncle Wilbur, not now. Yes, all right, all right. Later on I'll tell you that one. Well, so you've come east to marry my niece, huh? No, it's Bob who is going to marry her. Speak up, don't mumble. I ain't gonna bite you. I'm taking Anne back the Deadwood to marry my brother, Bob. Oh, hey, well that's fine. Well, you have my consent. I always figured that you and Anne would get married, ever since you was kids together. Don't mind Uncle Wilbur, he'll go to sleep. -How's that? -Nothing, darling. Tell me about the social life in Deadwood. I suppose they have dances every Saturday night. I've even seen men dancing Friday afternoon at the end of a rope. Now you're trying to frighten me. Well, you yourself said it's life in the wrong. Say, you're afraid I can't do without comforts, aren't you? Not exactly. I just can't picture you in a frontier town. That sounds like a challenge, and I love challenges. How soon can we leave? Well, the St. Joe starts upstream day after tomorrow. Can we make it? We can, but remember that I've been in Deadwood for six months and I'd like to catch up with some civilization. For a starter, will you go out to supper with me? Course she will, and so will I. I say I haven't been out to supper for more than a year. [Wilbur chuckling] [bell dinging] [soft music] [water splashing] [horn blaring] -Enjoying the trip? -Oh, I love it. How far do we go on the boat? To Fort Pierre then overland to Deadwood. Overland by stagecoach? Yes, the famous Deadwood Stage you've heard so much about. Oh, then we might be held up or attacked Indians. Not a chance. The whole country is patrolled by Custer and the 7th Cavalry. [sighs] Look, Anne, I wish you weren't so incurably romantic about this thing. You've built up a picture that isn't true. The West is a gusty, bawdy place that does things to people. Doesn't seem to have bothered you. That's because I'm not a part of it. I don't like it. I came out here to visit Bob and he insisted I stay awhile. After I get you to Deadwood, there'll no longer be any reason for me to stay. [horn blaring] [soft music] Two. One. Three. One. $50, if you can stand it, gentlemen. It's too rich for my blood. No place for two small pair. I'll have to raise that $200, sir. Take it, um, I was only foolin' Better luck next time. I'd like to see what won that. Sure you want to? Paying customer, eh? I have every right to see the hand. You could have had six cards. A busted straight. That's one time you should've called. [men laughing] Oh, a snicker. I should have known with that hair and them fancy clothes. Gentlemen, gentlemen. Mr. Jackson, I'm surprised at you. You keep out of this unless you want to get your ears pinned back, too. I won't stand for this, Duke, makin' a fool out of me. I thank you kindly, Mr. Jackson. Well, if you'll excuse me, I'll cash these in. I'll take care of that Duke before he leaves this boat. Mr. Jackson, that gentleman that happens to be James Butler Hickok. They called him Wild Bill when he was Marshal of Abilene. He. [stammering] The man I called. Wild Bill Hickok. Yes, sir. James Butler Hickok. Oh, excuse me. Afternoon. Afternoon. Traveling far? All the way to Deadwood. Ever been out that way? No, I haven't. Have you? Oh yes, my brother runs the Bella Union in Deadwood. Really? I realize this is none of my business, sir, but these boats are infested by professional gamblers. They're a dangerous lot. Well, that's right kind of you to warn me. I have seen a lot of them in Dakota. They generally go armed. I wouldn't be a bit surprised. Take a tip from me and borrow a gun. You might need it. [horn blaring] [water splashing] [voices clamoring] Oh, you dance much to well, Mr. Holliday. My Uncle Wilbur always warned me, beware the dancing man. Don't be alarmed. Light Moment Jim, they call me. I pour tea, take up packages, sing with a quivering baritone, and dance with any turn of the foot. But I promise you there's no harm in me. Oh yes, I'm quite sure of that. Oh, Jim, I do want to thank you for the many little things you've done to make this trip so enjoyable. It has been fun, hasn't it? Well, don't look so solemn. We'll have good times in Deadwood, won't we? Yes, won't we? The three of us. [light music] [dramatic music] We're tying up in Plainview and we'll be there for one hour. Those going ashore will please be governed accordingly. -Ticket to the West? -Oh, I'd love too. I'll meet you right here. [horn blaring] [upbeat music] Anything like you think it is? Well, not exactly. Can we cross the street? -All right. -[soft music] So I told him I'd give him $100. Look out. [guns firing] Jim. Oh, Jim. Oh, Jim. He's hurt. You did it, you shot him. I'm sorry, ma'am, I don't believe I did. Well don't just stand there, do something. Let me have a look. Well, there's no gunshot wounds. -Maybe he bumped his head. -[Jim groaning] Oh, sure enough he struck it on this rock here. Let me help him up. Where am I? Oh, my head. Jim, are you all right? He'll be all right soon as we get him back to the boat. Mr. Hickok, thanks. Them two fellas have been making fight talk around here for a week. Yeah. I knew them in Abilene. I'll be glad to answer to your authorities. No need to, Mr. Hickok. Clear case of self-defense. What'd he call you? Hickok. Not Wild Bill? Oh, that's just a nickname. And I was gonna protect you. Well, I appreciate it, believe me. [soft music] Feeling better? Sure. And you? I can still see those poor men lying there. You'll have to get accustomed to a lot of things, Anne. Those men we saw back there in Plainview, they were civilized like us once before they came out here. But they should be stronger for what they've been through. And ax gets dull when it's chopped down too many trees. Has Bob changed too? Oh, you know Bob, nothing can change him. Anne, don't think I'm being disloyal. But if you want a little more time-- Oh, I can't go back now. Don't be fooled by a schoolgirl's dream. This is reality. Sure, I have courage enough to go through with things. Isn't it wise to acknowledge a mistake? Mistake? I don't know what you mean. Yes you do. [somber music] I love this part of it. The quiet night, the clean smell of things. The rest is rather terrifying. Anne, you and I, we sorta, what I mean is that when I was knocked out back there the street, I had a beautiful dream. A dream that you were holding my head and your arms, but you called to me, your voice trembled. -You were worried. -That wasn't a dream. Anne. [romantic music] -[voices clamoring] -[bells ringing] [guns firing] Looks like some kind of celebration. Oh, look at it, Jim. I'll explain everything and Bob will understand. [guns firing] Just a little welcomin' party, folks. Everybody turns out when I come to town. Hurricane Harry, they call me. [laughs] We must get this over with. I don't know where he is. There's Bob, oh Bob. Anne, I'd know you any place. It's a swell turnout, isn't it? -Bob, I want to talk to you. -How you doin', miss? -Welcome to Deadwood. -This is Rocky Plummer. I'm Chief of the fire department. See my helmet? Oh, I forgot my helmet. Bob. Something's happened. -Welcome, Miss Anne. -She's in there. -Bob, must-- -The parade's all ready. Oh good, come on.

You thought you could horn in, did ya? Well, there ain't no place in this camp for ladies. You're going out in the next stage. Oh, this is Jane-- Never mind the introductions. I'll tell her who I am. Me and Bob helped settle this town. We trapped for food 'fore the wagon trains come and we fought Injuns 'fore there were soldiers. And when the smallpox hit us, I nursed him through it. Could you have done that with your pretty face and your fine clothes? -If you'd only listen to me. -I've listened long enough. I'm doing the talking now. No frizzly haired hoity toity petticoat rustler is gonna beat my time. There's something I want to tell you, Jane. Jim and I were married in Fort Pierre. You... and him? -[upbeat music] -[voices clamoring] Oh. Hello, Jane, I was just thinking about you. I'll bet. I'm been meaning to talk to you for a long time, but you know how fellas keep putting things off. Yeah. I know. I knew you'd take it like a sport. I had it all figured out. I knew just what I was gonna say to you. And I knew just about what you were gonna say to me. What did you figure you'd say to me first? Well, let me see. Was gonna say, Jane, we've been partners a long time. Strictly business, of course. Now that we're calling it quits, no hard feelings, eh? Yeah, I remember. We promised to have a last drink together with big smiles all around. That's right. I won't need that today. Jane, look, I want to talk to you seriously. Now that we're through, I got a little present for you. Here. [soft music] Had it all planned, didn't you? Well, I just wanted to give you a start someplace else. I didn't want you to rob banks or anything. That's where you went wrong. You don't owe me nothing. I don't owe you nothing? After all the years we've known each other? Yeah, after all the years we've known each other. You didn't think I had enough style for you, is that it? You wanted a wife you could be proud of, one you can show off in front of the whole town. A girl all wrapped up with the lace and pink ribbons, a Sunday school look in her eye. -Wait a minute. -Wait a minute? I'm just getting unwound. What do you think I've been following you around for? You thought you couldn't buy me off, put me on a pension? Well, you can keep it. If that girl you picked is your idea of a beautiful, faithful, trusting female, I'm downright sorry for ya. -Jane. -What would you think if I told you you're miss high and mighty better than them all is already married? -That's a lie. -Sure it is. And here's another one. The man she's married to is Jim, your own brother. They got married in Fort Pierre on the way up here. Buy your way out of that one. And next time, don't come running back to me. -[voices clamoring] -[light music] [men cheering] Just gonna find you. -[door slamming] -[hand slapping] I oughta kill you. How'd you think you'd get away with it? Wasn't thinkin' of gettin' away with anything. I tried to tell you at the stagecoach and your brothers house but you wouldn't listen to me. Yeah, well I'm listenin' now. Well go ahead and start talking, and it better be good. [Anne] It is good. It's the best reason in the world. We love each other. -You what? -We love each other. How can you? You haven't seen each other for ten years. -What's that got to do with it? -Nothing. Nothing, except when you were playing around back east, I was out here working. And what do you think kept me going? You wrote letters tellin' me what a great fella I was and how much you were looking forward to joining me. Oh Anne, and I understand it was the boat and the moonlight and the music and his fancy talk. -Now look, Bob. -Shut up. I don't blame you, Anne. We can go to Judge Newcomb, we can tell him it was a mistake. But it wasn't a mistake, Bob. I knew exactly what I was doing. Oh, I don't blame you for not understanding. You wouldn't want me knowing I was in love with Jim, would you? It just happened, Bob. Nobody has control over a thing like that. Is that the way you want it, Anne? Yes, Bob.

Now look, Bob, you don't want to get mixed up in anything like that. You just want to get even with somebody. Why don't you go in the bath for a few days? I tried that and it didn't work. Now I want action. Known about that setup of yours and McCall's for a long time. I'm running this office, Bob. You're running the Bella Union. We're both doing all right. Yeah, I know all about that. Now I want to be dealt in. It's not that easy, Bob. Believe me, I know. Once you start, you've got to go on through. You got to play what's dealt. You can't get tired after a few bad hands. They won't let you quit, they can't afford to. Stop preaching, will ya? Where's McCall? Well... If your mind's made up, might go out to Big Creek. Find them back down the Hills. [upbeat music] [hooves clopping] [Harry laughing] You know what I says to judge? I says to her judge, paying alimony's like buying oats for a dead horse. [Harry laughing] Well sir, I know what the judge is going to do. He like to have a apoplexy. He said to me, Mr. Haberdasher. [tense music] [shouting] Well, that's how it's done, huh? Yeah. Do I have to wear one of those Indian outfits? If you want to stay healthy? [punch landing] [chest crashing] Whoa! [wood splintering] I knew you was quiet company. -[Harry groaning] -[suspenseful music] [screaming] I'll stick with you even if I have to stick too. Wayward stage! Runaway stage! Here she comes, -get down, get down. -[wagon crashing] [stage crashing] [voices clamoring] What happened to your horses? The Browns took 'em? Then where are they? Well, it ain't easy on the back. [voices overlapping] Good old Fort Pierre. Say, you look like the big fat blubber head that run me out of Deadwood. Didn't I meet you in Abilene? No, I ain't never been in Abilene. Well, that's funny. You know you remind me of a fella who used to play around with the Kansas Kid. Nice boy, the kid. You were shot in the back [speaking in Chinese] Send your bill to the Express. [speaking in Chinese] Injuns. There must've been 50 of 'em, General. They shot the guard and stole the gold. Stole the gold? That doesn't sound like Indians to me. -When did this happen? -Back at Big Creek. And they was injuns, all right. I oughta know, they jumped on the stage and tried to scalp me. I never seen the like of it in all my life. I ain't seen the like of it. [General] Send a detail back, see if they can pick up the trailer. Come into the office. We'll make out a complete report. -Hello, Jane. -Howdy, General. Indians, huh? Jane, you know more about Indians than any five white men. What do you think of this attack on the stage? Maybe the Sioux did it and maybe not. I seen signs in the hills, smoke signals, night campfires. But where they strike or when, nobody knows. If I only had more men. They expect me to patrol hundreds of square miles, be every place at once. These towns have got to learn to protect themselves. Well, this one votes to bein' wide open. They won't know how open it is till they see them Redskins galloping through from both ends. Call your leading citizens together, Jane. I want to talk to them. Good. I think the first step is to clean out the known outlaws and make the town safe within itself. We're with you on that, General, but we haven't any legally recognized courts, no authority. I'm coming to that. I suggest you apply to the Federal Government for papers of incorporation, but I don't see any reason why you can't go ahead and elect a Marshal here and now. [voices clamoring] General Custer, you pick him. We'll take any man you name. I represent the Army and the United States Government. If you'll excuse me, I think this is a matter you should settle among yourselves. Good day, gentlemen. -[men murmuring] -Jane. As far as I'm concerned, there's only one man for Marshal. That's what they said about me when they made me Fire Chief. How about you, Mr. Hickok? I appreciate the honor, believe me. But I came here to find gold and that's about all I'll have time for. Oh, that's too bad. What we've got to have is a man with nerve enough to fight it out and shoot it out to the finish. To the finish, to the finish. Oh, well you see I'm a pretty busy man with my fires and tending bar, you know? -How about you, Bob? -Hmm? Oh no, no, I'm not the man for the job, but I know who is. Of course I don't like to mention it, we've been so close, but I'd like to see my brother Jim get the job. You really think he could handle it? Well, if Bob thinks his brother can do it, I move we appoint him. Well, he could sure use a job too 'cause well he and Anne been working a claim out there on the hills and well, they ain't got enough gold out of there to fill a tooth. What's your opinion, Mr. Hickok? I think maybe he might surprise you. That settles it, then. We'll notify him of his appointment. [voices clamoring] [soft music] Jim, we've got company. I'll be right up. Howdy, Mrs. Marshal. Marshal? Yes ma'am. That's what we came to tell you about. Your husband has been appointed Marshal of Deadwood. Now that's a fact. Maybe I've got something to say about that. Why, it's the greatest honor a man can have. It'll make you the leading citizen of the town. Oh, you can't say no now, especially after we turned it down. That is so you could have it. What does he mean? What he's trying to say is, well, we're organizing the town and Bob sold us the idea of making Jim the Marshal. -Jim, what do you think? -Not for me. Well, I wouldn't know the first thing a Marshal's supposed to do. Well, you could learn. But, Jim, it would mean living in town again, seeing other people. Building empires. Perhaps, not the way we planned, maybe. But you'd be getting ahead and you'd be making something of yourself. The claim isn't much good anyway, huh? Well, it looks like I'm handing in my shovel for a badge. When do I start? I'm sure you will know best about that. Remember, we're behind you. We're all behind ya. Yeah, way behind you. Hello Jim. Howdy, Jim. -How are ya, Marshal? -What? Oh, just fine. Good luck, son. [voices clamoring] [Wong Lee yelling in Chinese] [bell ringing] [man] Chinese laundry's a burnin'! [bell ringing] [fire roaring] Hurry up and get that hose on the wall. All right, boys, I'm comin', I'm comin'. [man] All right, work fast men! Start the water, prime the pump. [water splashing] Get back, man, let's have some room. Yeah, get back, boy. Don't you know it's the Marshal talkin'? [men laughing] [light music] [gun firing] [men laughing] Who did that? It slipped. After all, I am Marshal here. Let's quit the horseplay and try and put this fire out. You're too late, Marshal. Look. Law and order comes to Deadwood. That's a good one. [both laughing] You looking for me? I was. I had a strange idea I wanted to thank you for making Jim Marshal. Oh, that's all right. [somber music] Anne. -What are you doing? -It's no use, Jim. You were right about the West. It's not for us, we don't belong out here. You don't mean that. Oh, why should we go on fooling ourselves? There's only one reason you've stayed, it's because you thought I wanted to. You hate the West. You told me there was nothing to keep you out here. They kind of made a fool out of me, didn't they? No, Jim, it's not that. It's just I decided I was wrong. I've lost all those silly romantic notions. I have to laugh at myself when I think how I wanted us to take the West by the tail and swing it around our heads. Big job. Yes, and why should we bother? We're not that kind of people like you and I. We're going back East. Then it would kind of look like I was running away, wouldn't it? What difference would that make? You don't owe them anything. Yes I do, in a way. I owe them you. I'd hate to make us spend the rest of your life thinkin' maybe you picked the wrong man. I'll never think that, Jim. I know you won't. I'm gonna see to it. Jim, where are you going? Off to start swinging the West around. [somber music] [light music] [guns firing] [men laughing] You're the bouncer. Why don't you put them fellas out? Me? No. -It's my day off, you do it. -Me do it? Suppose a fire breaks out, who's gonna take care of that? [light music] Come on, come on, throw them clubs some more. Keep 'em swinging. [men laughing] Here's our peace officer gonna get himself torn to pieces. Pretty good shooting. Well, well, if it ain't our new Marshal. You guessed it. They tell me you're gonna keep things in order hereabouts. Well, they have been a little rough. Somebody has to smooth 'em out. You ain't aiming to starting on me, are ya? I might. You haven't seen our jail, have you? No. And I don't intend to. Get 'em up. Up! I guess you're gonna have to take his gun again. That's the way they got the Kansas Kid. [curtain crashing] [punch landing] Drop that gun. Who's afraid? [gun crashing] Back towards the wall. [bright music] Got a room reserved for you, McCall. Judge Newcomb wants to talk to you in the morning. [curtain crashing] Come on, out this way. Come on. [gun firing] [sand crashing] Get outta here. -Rocky! -What? Bring me some water. Oh, right away. Where do you want it, the water? In the face, in the face. [water splashing] Where's McCall? He went right out that door. You sure got him bloody scared. Look at me. What's a matter with you? Well you said in the face. In his face! It's too late now. Oh! [door opens] It's about time you got here. I knew something was gonna happen. -Hickok always was bad luck to me. -What's wrong? There's something you and me gotta get settled -about that brother. -What'd he do? We were sitting there having a drink. What are you doing here? Just plyin' my trade. I called us a date with Judge Newcomb in the morning. I'm gonna make sure he keeps it. Well, if you've come to get him, get it over with. Come on. Sorry if I interrupted anything. Smart idea of yours giving him that badge. Yeah. Wasn't it? [soft music] I've been waiting for you. What are you all dolled up for? How about maybe we'd go out for a high heel time. You know, like we used to? I laid out your good clothes. I'm busy. -How do you like my dress? -It's all right, I guess. I'll bet you forgot how I looked in one. Go find somebody to play with. I told you I was busy. -You've been busy a lot lately. -What if I am? You can't get away with the Bob. Ever since she came here, you've been different. Can't you see the change in you? Sneaking off to the Badlands to meet Jack McCall and ruin everything ya built up. Try mindin' your own business for a change. This is my business. Bob. Let's get away from here. There's still plenty of new country. Get away from here? Just when I'm getting things lined up? Lined up with what? Robbery and murder. You ain't foolin' me. I know you had to make your brother Marshal just so he'd stop his flood from a .30-30 and leave you a free hand. -Now you and-- -[hand slapping] Told you to mind your own business, didn't I? [somber music] [door slamming] Hi, Mr. Benson. Hello, Jim. How's business? A little slow, but I've got an idea it'll pick up after you make another shipment. Well, I'm afraid it's gonna be slow for a long time. I wouldn't ship an ounce of gold without a cow-- The injuns won't touch it if there's any cavalry around. They know what's going on. They know too well to suit me. Listen, you and the other so-called solid citizens made me Marshal of this town. You wanted law and order, didn't ya? Yes, but I don't want to risk losing-- You won't lose anything. Just make a routine shipment same as you always did. Only this time. [bright music] [dramatic music] Uh oh, here comes galloping trouble. Hyah! [guns firing] [laughing] Whoa, you redskins! Whoa. Come on. What are we gonna do, Bob? Scatter. Mercer, you come with me. [suspenseful music] [guns firing] [Mercer crashing] It's a White man. [guns firing] [soft music] Marshal, they wasn't Indians. Bill here just dropped one, it turned out to be Mercer. Hello, darling. Hello. Something's wrong. Oh no, nothing's wrong. We caught up with the stage robbers. Wasn't that what you expected to do? Sure. You might as well tell me. Whatever it is, it's my problem too. I'm gonna turn in my badge now. Why, Jim? It was Bob that tried to hold up the stage today. Bob? But I thought the Indians. He was dressed and painted like one. I didn't know it was Bob until, well I found his watch fob. Bob's? It was Dad's. Bob wears it for a lucky piece. Do you think I could bring him in and let them hang him? He belongs to this country. Without men like Hickok, Bob, and Custer, the West would still be a wilderness. Hickok, Bob, and Custer. I wonder... Somehow I don't believe they're the ones who are gonna push the wilderness back. Oh, maybe history will say so. But what about the people who plant farms along the stage trails and build schools instead of gambling houses, common people like us? Oh, Bob and the others, they came here looking for shiny adventure and they'll go on searching for it for the rest of their lives. But we're different, you and I, we came here to stay, just as our fathers went to Ohio and Missouri and even California. But leaders never settle a country. The real pioneers are the ones who build homes and raise families and teach their children respect for the law. Custer and Hickok and Bob are like bright stars that blaze a trail across the heavens and disappear. We're like trees that take root and grow old and replenish the Earth. Oh Jim, this is the last frontier. And it's people like us who will make it part of America. [patriotic music] You might as well quit pacing up and down like a cougar. Walking ain't going settle what's the matter with you. Look, get out of here and leave me alone. That's all there is to it. Just get out of here and leave ya alone. -Simple, huh? -Yeah. Come on, drink some coffee. [door knocking] Who is it? Jim. I wanna talk to you. Howdy, Marshal. -Thanks, Jane. -What do you want? -I wanna do you a favor. -To do what? I wanna return this. Where'd you get it? From one of the Indians that attacked the stage today. Oh, an Indian, huh? What did he get? That's what I'm waiting to hear. Oh. Oh, so that's it, huh? Well, Marshal, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I lost it in a fight in front of the Dakota house about a month ago. Just about the time you and Anne got back. You remember that night, don't you Jane? Yeah, I remember that night. Well, in that case, I'm sorry. Marshal, Jack McCall just shot his way out of jail. About that fob business. I'm glad I was wrong. Jim. Jim, I'd be careful 'cause he's making powerful talk. Thanks, Spearfish. Well, this looks like a blow up. I'll deputize Hickok. -[gun firing] -[dramatic music] -Who did it? -McCall. And in the back too. Somebody took his favorite chair. It's the first time he ever sat with his back to the door. [somber music] You'll raise your right hand to be sworn in. You do solemnly swear to uphold the law and discharge your duty as deputies, so help you. [all agreeing] I wouldn't send any men out of town if I was you. There's a lot of women and kids around here that wouldn't stand a chance holding off an Indian attack. -Attack? -The hills are full of Sioux. Look out there. And there. Yes, take four men to the east road and report to us a minute you see them coming. Rocky, get your fire department together and standby. Spearfish, find Anne and the get the kids into the Bella union. See the breastworks are thrown up and riflemen posted on the roof of every building. Joe, you better go on along. Jesse. I've never seen the white chaplain. I got some questions to ask you later. Lock them up, boys. Wait a minute. Say, what's going on here? Get on the fastest horse in town and ride up to General Custer. -Where is he? -I don't know, find him! [frogs croaking] Indian attack, huh? Are you sure? Well, you can see for yourself, all them signals. It's a wonder they haven't raided before. That town's wide open. Plenty excitement around one of those raids. Be kind of busy, won't they? Yeah. Fella uses his head, he might have things pretty much his own way. Get mounted. Where are we going? Gotta get the bank before it opens. Keep your eyes open. Come on over that hill. -Wake up, Rocky. -[gun firing] Got another one, I got another one. What's a matter with you? Musta been asleep, I guess. Not yet, just stand by. Stand by? Stand by who? [voices clamoring] Go on, go on. Go on you kids, get to bath time. Go on. Yes, I rounded them all up, Miss Anne. Please try and keep them quiet. I've just gotten the others to sleep. The Indians ever get a hold of this one, they'll all leave town. Scared? A little. Is there any word from Custer yet? I'll keep a strong guard posted here. All the men I can spare. [voices clamoring] [singing] Spearfish! Ma'am? Well, her mother told me if I had any trouble with her to give her a bottle. A fine father you'd make. Well I thought maybe it would make her sleepy. It always does me. Any more signal fires. Everything's quiet, too quiet. Seen Bob? Not since you did. Too bad, we could use him. And everybody else that can handle a gun. Seen your wife taking care of those kids. She's all right in her own way. You're all right too, Jane. If it hadn't been for you, this town wouldn't have had a chance. We're not out of the woods yet. [baby laughing] -[suspenseful music] -[men whooping] [guns firing] [wagon crashing] [fire roaring] [guns firing] [woman screaming] [wood crashing] [glass shattering] [guns firing] They've mixed in with the Indians. They'll never know the difference. Wait a minute. I'm giving the orders around here. -[dramatic music] -[men whooping] [guns firing] Fall back to the south. Burn it! They're coming through the north barricade. [guns firing] Get some water and some towels, quickly! [gun firing] [dramatic music] Here we go. [glass shattering] -Keep us covered. -Come on, come on. [guns firing] Jane, they're cleaning out the bank. Hey, Joe, come in here and help us, hurry up. Hiya, Marshal. Surprised? I didn't believe you thought the fob. Didn't expect anything as crazy as this. Yeah, well this proved that Anne married the right man, huh? Let me get one thing straight. Were you mixed up in this before you sent me back to St. Louis? -What difference does that make? -Give me your gun. I don't give my gun to anybody. I'm not fooling this time, Bob. Come over and get it. Why don't you shoot from there? Go on, Jim, start shootin'. Get over in that corner, go on. Get over there, get over there. Take his gun, Marshal. [punch landing] [gun firing] [somber music] Bob! It's the only way I could stop you, Bob. Indians attacking your own people, and your own brother! [guns firing] [suspenseful music] [men whooping] [woman screaming] [valiant music] I thought I heard a bugle. Hurricane must have made it. Jim! I'm all right, take care of Jane. [somber music] [crying] You've done a fine thing, defending your town. I wish I could stay and help you, but the 7th has been ordered to the Little Big Horn. Were we hope to have it out once and for all with Sitting Bull and the Sioux. Hooray for General Custer! [all cheering] -Good luck, General. Come back soon. -Good-bye, General. [upbeat music] What are you starin' at? Don't you know when a lady needs a drink? Come on. [theme music playing]
