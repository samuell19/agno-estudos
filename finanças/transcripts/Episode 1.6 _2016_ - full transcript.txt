Previously on Bear Grylls Survival School. This is when it gets serious. I'm nervous about this one. The teamhave been to hell and back on a brutal two day expedition. Be careful of your footing. Taking the ultimate leap of faith into a pitch black abyss. I'm a bit more nervous than I thought. Making campin the ruins of a farmhouse during a ferocious storm. We're cold. We are soaking wet. And tackling atreacherous mountain in still more atrocious weather. We're freezing. Savannah stoodout for conquering her fears. Well done, Savannah. While Keiron started to show real leadership skills. Keep going. Go on. Keep going. I'm not going to let you fall. And it was a turning point for all of the guys inlearning to cope with the wild at its wildest. You're winning my respect the hard way. I'm Bear Grylls. When I was growing up, allthis was my playground. I want to find out if kidstoday have got what it takes to abandon their mobilephones and survive for two weeks out here in the wild. Watch out! I really don't want to do this. Dig deep. Finish strong. Welcome toBear Grylls Survival School. Coming up, aheart stopping sheer drop. I'm struggling to breathe. And theharsh realities of making supper, survivor style. You're a brave man, Adam. The team havedone a great job coming through an extremelychallenging two days coping with everything Survival School and the Welsh weather has thrown at them. So today, I'm raising the stakes. I'm going to bring them to this disused quarry where they'll face a death defying abseil from an overhangingcliff more than 30 meters high. Yeah, they're going to bescared looking down this. I've lost count of how many times I've abseiled down cliffs inthe military and on expeditions. It's all about good techniqueand holding your nerve. They're going to love it. The young survivors have no idea what's in store for them today. You all right guys? Can you see me? Can you hear me? Yes. OK so the next part of this journey is going to be physical. It's going to be tough. And at the end of it, you'regoing to be getting wet. From here you're going to abseiloff the sheer face to about 110 foot down to the water. You're then going to dropoff the rope into the water and swim ashore back to the bank. You up for this? Yes. First up, totake on the drop is Charlie. Stand up straight now. Straight on the abseil. Survival Schoolis taking the 14-year-old way out of his comfort zone. Hey what is up, guys? My name is Charlie and today-- At home, Charlie is full of confidence immersed in the virtual world of the internet. But out here, it's a whole new world and the extreme night in the derelict building left him close to quitting. I just don't want to stay here tonight. I was impressed with how he came back stronger yesterdayand pushed on up the mountain. And now he faces another big test of nerve and determination. Biggest fear is probablyjust when I'm at the top looking down because it looked pretty high. It takes bottle and encouragement from instructor Scott totrust the rope and get going. Lean back. Get your shoulders back. Aw, I don't feel-- this doesn't feel safe. It's very, very safe. - I'm slipping already. - Go down. I'm just slipping off the wall. Lean back. Look at me. You're like this. Now off you go. That's a perfect repel abseil position. Good lad. After a few stutterers, Charlie is on his way. Put your leg out otherwise, you'll hit the wall. But he's strugglingto keep his feet on the wall. That's it. That's it. Nice and wide. And he startsto show real signs of panic. Struggling to breathe. You're all right. Just take a few deep breaths where you are. Leader Sarahhelps talk him down. GoodLad, get your breath back. I can't man. It's OK. Don't make it hard work. You haven't got far to go. Untangle your feet. All credit to Charlie. He's not letting the cliffget the better of him. There we go. Perfect. And lock off there. Are you ready? Yeah. Three, two, one. Let go! I honestly did not thinkl'd be able to do that. I was waiting around at the top and thinking, am I going to do it, am I not? So I'm really happy that I've done it now. - It's not going anywhere.- Yeah. You control your descent. In contrast, Tarais showing no signs of nerves whatsoever. I'm really, really excited because I really like abseiling. I think it's really fun. Tara has spent much of her life in the Australian outdoors. It's given her lots ofconfidence to take on the wild, and so far, she's risen topretty much every challenge at Survival School. Yeah! That's it. But this is in a different league. Come on, Tara. Oh my goodness. I'm high up. And 30meters up, her confidence starts to drain away. You OK, Tara? This is really, actually quite scary. Oh my goodness. Whoa. OK. Halfway down, my feetstarted to come off the wall. So I was scared I was going to bang forward. Ow, the rope. Oh my gosh. I just leaned back a bit more and I saved myself. I just went down that 100 foot drop. Abseiled down it, and it was so scary. And even super confident Tara has found it tough, that'snot good news for Adam. He's always had a serious fear of heights. I don't know why I'm scared. It's just something I'm scared of. You know, that way when youcan't explain a feel that it just-- when you're doingit, it just takes over you and it's just like, you're stuck. I'm just like that with heights. Happy with that? Ha ha ha ha. I'm down here with you. OK so show-- I think I will do it, but I'm real scared of it. Bless him. Adam's scared off his socks. He doesn't even like being ona 10 foot drop, never 110 foot. OK, lean back. Keep that rope behind your back. Let it just go throughthe fingers nice and easy. That's it. Good lad. Down you go. Shoulder-width apart all the time. Adam showinggreat strength of character to push through his fear. Good. You're in control, Adam. You are in control. Good lad. Nice and easy. Good boy. Quick look over the right shoulder, see where you're going. - No thanks. OK. I didn't think I'd ever do anything like that because of my fear of heights. I genuinely thought Iwould freeze and not do it. He makes itdown without any hesitation. Good. Lean back. I feel-- I'm feeling happy, proud, and just delighted with myself. Adam, well done. You did amazing. Is that the scariest thing you've ever done? - Yeah. - Yeah. Well done. Excellent. Throughout Survival School, we're judging whether theboys or girls do best overall, and at the moment the girls' team is 3-1 up. So the boys have a lot of catching up to do. I can barely reach the wall. So you're incontrol, If you go too fast, you burn your hands. - Hi, Sarah. - Hello. But as the rest of the survivors take on the sheer drop, it's the girls whose technique is most impressive. Good, Lavinia. You look really strong. Good, Maria. Keep going. One, let go. Are you happy? Yeah. I got to the end and my hands were like this. I really didn't want tolike drop that rope at all. Let go. I was shaking loads. That took a massive amountof bravery to do that. So fun. I could do anything now. One, push away. Words can't explain how I'm feeling. So proud of everyone and in myself. My young recruits are starting to act like true wilderness warriors and I'm also impressed with their teamwork. When Alanah hit a low yesterday, it was good to see others immediately rallying around. Thursday waiting for love, waiting for love. And whenSavannah got claustrophobic, Kieron was there to help. I would rather go home. No you wouldn't. You're doing your mom proud. You take that off and your mom will be the proudest in the world. Well done. You guys. You're learning more and moreto have each other's back. Always look out for each other. And this is what we'retrying to teach you guys. What's the worst thing you'veever licked or eaten, Bear? The worst thing I've eatenprobably raw goat's testicles. Tell you what happened. This Berber tribesmen, they live in the desert. He got this goat. He'd killed it, took offthe testicles gave it to me. I chewed it. I threw up in my mouth. So then I had a mouth fullof goat ball and vomit, and then I had to swallow it both. That was like the worst. It was like a mix ofvomit and goat testicles. What was the worst thing you've ever drunk like? Probably a mix of urine, myown urine, mixed with snake innards because I'd skinned thesnake and then I needed to pee but I didn't want to waste the pee because I was in the desert. So I peed into snakeskin, tiedup, had it around my neck, and I was walking for like a long time and eventually, I thought itwas time to drink the pee. Got the snake, undid it, drank out of it. But it had been like fermentingin the snake skin and innards. Like the worst cocktail ever. Have you ever come close to dying? Like you actually thought youwas going to die in the wild? I have come close to dying a few times. Close shaves with parachutesand crevices and sharks and salt water crocodiles because however good you are, everybody gets it wrong sometimes. We always make mistakes. Back in basecamp, there's some bad news. The last few days of terrible weather have taken a heavy toll onone of the young survivors. Savannah is in a lot of pain. When an expedition team spendsso much time being soaked through, serious foot and bodyrashes can quickly take hold, and ironically it's Savannah's top effort, both in the derelict building and taking on the mountain which hasgiven her medical problems. Really well done yesterdaywith the mountain challenge. We noticed this you werelimping around a little bit. And what you've basically got is a gobi rash or basically sweat rash. And it's caused by wet, dry, wet, dry, and chafing. I've had it. Sarah, you've had it I know, as well. I know how much it hurts. OK and I know the importanceof getting back into somewhere where you can look after it, somewhere dry and this environment justisn't the best place to be. With a realdanger of infection developing, my leaders have had to make a very difficult call on medical advice. We made that decision, wethink it's time to go home. OK, Savannah? I know it's disappointing, but this isn't failure. I don't want to go home. I don't want to accept thefact that I've been this far and I've just got to turn back and leave it. Leave the team. Guys come this way. And just gather round, gather round guys. Come on team. You probably noticed as wehave that Savannah has been struggling a little bit this morning and over the last few days. There's no way that she cansort it out in the field. So unfortunately, she's goingto have to leave the Bear Grylls Survival School. Oh my gosh. Savannah, you tried your best all week. You came through. Yeah, you stuck through. You did the cave and the mine. You ate the worm. You got over a massive fear. My highlights aregetting over all my fears like claustrophobia, and sleeping outside in a derelict spooky building. Just getting on with all ofthe team and having a laugh is one of the best things. Savannah, well done. OK, you've done really well on this course. It's going to be hard losing a team member, but also a friend and that'sgoing to be the hard bit. She played a crucial part in the team. If it weren't for Savannah, then I don't think the girls would be 3-1 up. Obviously losing Savannahis a real blow for the group, you know. And it's going to hit everyone a little bit, because they're starting to be really tight. But Savannah leaves with her head held high. She climbed higher thanshe'd ever climbed before, faced so many fears head on, andl, for one, am so proud of her. On a scale of one to 10, I'd rate the experience, like now looking back, 10. Off the charts. To help lift thespirits of those remaining, Sarah has a surprise announcement. As a reward for all your hardwork in the last few days, we are going to treat youwith something quite special. Each of you are going to be given five minutes to have a phone call home. Banging! I'm just excited to like hearmy mum and my dad and everyone. I'm happy, but I feel like I'm just going to talk to her and, then when it's over I'm going to be thinking about them all. I reckon I'm going to cry to be honest here. It's like-- I'm just so excited. I just can't wait. Hello?- Hi, Dad. It's been six action packed days since they last hadcontact with their families. All right? Hi everyone. Hi! There you are. How are you? - Hey. How are you? - I'm good. How are you? How are you? Fine, thank you. I miss you so much. I miss you too. I'm having a really great time. I'm just, you know, just goingto cry because I miss you. I'm good, thanks. Hi, Babu. Hi. Hi, Mum. Hiya How are you? Are you OK? Yeah, I'm OK. For Bailey, for phoning home is especially emotional. He's been homesick from almostthe first moment he came here. I'm in the house most of the time. And I'm with my family most of the time, yeah. So, yeah. It's been different beingaway from them so long. Yeah. The 13-year-oldcomes from South Wales and is very close to his family. So who will you miss then, Bailey? Probably Kenzie and Henry the most. Aw, they'll be all right, love. Before Survival School, he spent most of his time inside at home. He even gets his hair cut at home by his aunt. Where are you going tobe sleeping in the nights? A tent. With all the creepy crawlies? Bailey's come along way in less than a week, and I hope his phone callhelps him stay the course. So areyou enjoying it though? Yeah, I'm enjoying it. But I miss home really much. You miss us, is it? Yeah. All right. We miss you too. It won't be long now, will it? No. Another week. Another week. You're all right though, are you? Yeah, I'm all right. Soexcited to hear your voice. Yeah. What's been happening? Oh, it's been unbelievable here. It's been, actually it's been brilliant. Gettingon with everybody all right? Yeah, everybody's fine. We've got on really well. Yeah, I've made new friends here. Yeah, everyone's so nice. We had to do this bungeejump into complete darkness. Yeah, just a casual climbto a waterfall usually. Just normal day's stuff. No I haven't killed any bees here yet, but. I got voted for survivorof the mini expedition. We literally just go off and just start doing push-ups and stuff. We have to have showers in the river. Oh my goodness. And obviously like I miss you guys, but I'm not kind of at the point of crying yet. Are you just so happy too? Yeah, I will. Take care, we love you. Thinking about you. - Will do. See you in a bit. Tell Granddad I love him loads. Are you missing me? Aw, she's crying. I didn't hear much of mysister because he just started crying so it's my sister. She's always like that. I've got to go now. OK? So love you. Love you. Love you. Love you so much. Love you, too bud. All right. Love you loads. Bye. Big hugs. Yeah bye. I don't know. Hearing about it justmade me happy and not sad. I was just like, yeah, hello. Bye. Mom and dad. Yeah, it was really hard, but I-- no, it doesn't make me even more homesick. It just makes want to do it. Just keep on going. Try my best. I think for these guys, having that phone call home would have been difficult you know on so many levels. Also it's going to remindthem of the physical stuff they're missing. For food, they can't just open that cupboard and get out some prepackaged stuff. They're having to really work for it. And especially tonight, when they're going to be preparing theirown supper, survival style. The aim of this next lesson isto talk about skinning rabbits. we're going to get rid of the feet. One leg off. Out in the wilderness, animals like these wild rabbitsmay be an essential source of vital protein. You may not want to becruel, but it's the survival. You're going to have to live and therefore, you're going to have to eat. You want to hit right here in this blade here. Go. Tara, would you want to do this bit? I can't do the fur. I'll do the meat bit. - Just give it a try. It's your dinner, Tara. Our outdoor girlTara is really struggling. I've never had a problem withlike handling dead animals, but like right now I just-- I can't even look at them. Come on. Give her some help guys. Come on. Come on, Tara. OK. You need to pull hard. I'll do it with you then. Hands here. Hands in together and just peel. Keep going for it. I know that happens. But it's just like doing it yourself and seeing it and smelling itis just like really different. Once it's cleaned up though, it looks just like the meatwe buy in the supermarket. That's what happens. That is the process. With you meat eaters, it'sreally good guys that you know this is the process. And so, supper tonight. Bon appetite. When it was-- if the eyes are looking at you. And that's what put me off. If they had took the headoff, it'd be all right. But the eyes. I'm going to at least try it because if not they'll have died for nothing. You've just got to do itfor the sake of the rabbit. Just do it down a bitlower by the bloody thing. The boys willbe pitted against the girls preparing their dinner. Do you want to do it, Lav? With the girlsteam well ahead overall, it's the last chance todayfor the boys to shine. We're hoping that thegirls crumble a little bit. I know that sounds mean, but hoping some of them didn't really like it that much. He said feel for it, didn't he? Feel for the bone. Definitely got some strong boys. Keiron, I know he's upfor it, myself, and Adam. No, don't. I'll get it. You're a brave man, Adam. The boys quickly get stuck in, but the girls are a bit more hesitant. Oh this is where it starts to smell. Do we do it with the knife? You might cut something we don't want to. Despite her earlier wobble Tara, is embracing the challenge. The other girls are full of great ideas. You know, cut that out. Move that away. But they didn't really lay hands on. If Alanah and Tara hadn'thave skinned that rabbit, I think it would still be covered in fur. The team's clean up the meat before it goes in the pot. And while their rabbit stew cooks, it's time for today's crucialvote for Team of the Day. The School currently standsat 3 to the girls and just 1 to the boys. Each leader will vote inturn, beginning with Sarah. You all tried very, very hard. Adam, particularly youcame up very, very strong. So for me, the Team of the Day goes the boys. OK. An action packed day. Boys, you were really brave. At the top of that abseil, fantastic. But, I have to go with technique and girls, you were really flawless with technique. My vote goes to the girls. All right. It's all down to theskinning of the rabbit then. Girls, you did really well. Alanah, you know, getting right in there and Tara, as well, you know, it wasn'tsomething you enjoyed. The boys did finish firstthough so, it's the boys. The boys have won the day. OK. That leaves it 3-2 to the girls. Girls, they're catching up with you. Dinner is served. And all the young survivorsgive their rabbit stew a try. I feel good about it. I know that it's fresh aswell, because I cooked it. Like many wild animals, it tastes a bit like somethingrather more familiar. It tastes a bit like chicken but then it's got like a weird aftertaste. Just tastes like chicken. Tastes like chewy chicken, really. We're now exactlyhalfway through Survival School, and it's great to seemy remaining nine recruits starting to develop a real taste for the wild, embracing the hardship, and getting back in touch with their adventurous side. It's like a big sleepover isn't it? Yeah, it's a big sleepover. Night, night. Next time, onBear Grylls Survival School. Pull hard, Tara. An extreme day out at the seaside. We're going to get you out of here. And running riot in camp. It's just over the place. This is just outrageous.
