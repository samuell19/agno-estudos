This is like a circus! You clumsy fool! Now you've spilled all the buttons scared the customer away... Run after the lady! Run after the lady! Oh, what worries I have... Oh, what worries I have. Tony! I cooked cauliflower. Nice, fresh cauliflower... Lovely! Here! For your good work. So you don't have to go about with empty pockets. What about that woman with the cross-stitch patterns? If she'd asked for a Persian carpet, we'd have sold her some elastic for pants? Well, the soup's excellent, Mrs. Lautmann. What did you put in - vinegar or... oh, you can't hear me. Uncle, what else are you going to do? I'll continue - but after the shop closes. Are you going to be my assistant? I will. You will? Well, sit down, Mr. Assistant! We'll take the wardrobes next... and the cupboard and the shelves in the shop. There's lots of work left. A shop must be nice and tidy. Whoever comes... A sweet girl sits on the porch, tumba, tumba, tumba-la sewing on a white dress... tumba, tumba, tumbala My Heinrich used to love this song... Tumba, tumba, tumba-la The soup... Mrs. Lautmann... the soup is excellent! I can't hear you. Come here! No. That's enough. My Heinrich often said: Rosalie, your dumplings... - Want some more? - That's enough. Your dumplings, Rosalie, he'd say, are as sweet as heavenly mannah. He enjoyed them because he was hungry. Uncle! are you sure that shellack is made from bird droppings? Of course I am. What else? Because you are hungry, that's why you enjoy it. On the porch sits a sweet girl, tumba, tumba, tumba-la John, will you be done soon? Wait, it won't take a minute. Fools! You can all go to hell! A town crier is a town-crier, a public servant... and you go and put up brass tubes, tin loudspeakers... robbing a poor man of his daily bread! Those tin loudspeakers can never replace me. What's the trouble, Piti Batchi? You haven't got a voice like this. Haven't I? Haven't I? We'll see The Cavalry, the Cavalry, puts roses in your cheeks The fools! What a circus! They started with that Tower of Babel - and here we are! Do you hear? Tin loud-speakers. I want to see what happens when we get heavy snow-falls and their wires are all covered up. What will they do? Where's your arisator, Mr. Katz? Where? You can guess. Do you want a massage or shall I wash your hair? A massage, a massage. Piti Batchi, I won't have time to attend to you today. I'll wait... I have plenty of time. Good day. Well, here I am. Welcome, Mr. Brtko! He won't have time to attend to you today, dear neighbor. It's Wednesday, isn't it, Mr. Kuchar? Of course it's Wednesday, it's been Wednesday all day. Imagine that! Do sit down, Mr. Brtko. Piti Batchi will only want his whiskers shortened, right? Do sit down! Talking of Wednesday... Old Mr. Cohen used to come in on his flat feet with a fistful of lilies of the valley. You do remember him, Imro, don't you? He was a stickler for details. As soon as the lilies of the valley were in bloom, old Cohen came to have his head shaved. As soon as I saw him I knew spring was here. The poor man! He suffered from a nervous tick later on - it went like this. What's so funny? You should shave him and his nervous tick! Piti Batchi... couldn't you come back tomorrow morning? It would be better. Tomorrow? Why should I? I was here before Brtko. That's true... but Mr. Brtko made an appointment, isn't that right, Mr. Brtko? Did he? I bet... stop trying to fool me, I know everything. Listen, Piti Batchi... it isn't always good to know everything. On the contrary! The less you know the better. I know you'd like to get rid of me. But Piti Batchi, what got into you? Piti Batchi is cross because the loud-speakers are doing him out of his business. You think I am not onto your escapades? I know everything, I tell you! I'll report you! And you! I'll report the whole lot of you! And I'll get paid for it. Well... we are in a mess. You don't have to be scared of me, gentlemen. What's in it for me if I report you? Goodbye, gentlemen. Damn you. We are in a fine mess. His bark is worse than his bite, don't worry. But Brtko - you are a stupid fool! Whom can one trust if not your next-door neighbors? Mr. Blau - the cashier of the Jewish Organization will explain the rest... Mr. Blau! I don't think we need an introduction. We don't, Mr. Blau. You know me... Blau... secretary of the Funeral Home. I wanted to thank you, Mr. Brtko, for accepting our terms. We want to do everything we can. We understand that your position is not an enviable one. Mr. Brtko happens to be a very good man... He knows our organization's financial difficulties. We have voted on paying you a certain sum not as a gift... but a regular income. Do trust us as we trust you, because it was the Lord's will to choose you as benefactor of the old widow Lautmann. Don't harm her... please. Why would Mr. Brtko harm her? It's just like I told you at the meeting - our - our dear neighbor, old Mrs. Lautmann, whom God has seen fit to let live till the admirable age of 78 years, has found the most just and honorable "arisator" in this country - a man who will not only be her helper but assist her in every way, if the Lord should choose to set her place on fire, Brtko would help to put it out. Every laborer is worthy of his wage - am I right? Our dear Lord hasn't found an arisator yet who'd be satisfied only with honor as his reward... That's the trouble. This is no time for joking. Our hearts are heavy with sorrow. In this hour of our misfortune. One, two, three, four, five! Tony! Monday was market-day, today it wasn't. You did not make as much on Monday as you did today. - What? - What? Nothing. But I am telling you - today was no market and your sales are bigger than on Monday. Oh, Evelyn... it's the Lord's will and doing! But it's not going to be that way every day. Sometimes you have the goods and no customers, another time you have customers but no goods. This is just like Christmas! You shouldn't have spent so much, Tony! I am an arisator as good as any other! - Wait! Close your eyes! - What? Don't ask and close your eyes! What a lovely smell! Let me see! Rosie has exactly the same! Let me see, Tony! Watch me! What do you say now? Watch it work! Stop it, you will waste all the perfume! I'll buy you some more - a full gallon if you want to. I don't care how much it costs. How lovely! See...? And you've only been in the business a few days. Imagine how rich we'll get if you keep it up for a year - two years, three years - ten years. We can buy a new house... fields. No, we'll get a fur coat - one for me and one for you! Just imagine how rich old Mrs. Lautmann must be. All this gold and jewels! And what does she need it for? Yes... that will do. What's the matter, Tony, aren't you happy? What? I am... but I still have something to do. Essenc... come on, Essenc! Tony! I made our bed in the front room today. Tony! I'm coming. That's enough! Hold it - hold it! Now pull! Ho-rup! Ho-rup! Ho-rup! Halt! Halt! Let go! Over... over... over... Enough! Enough! Halt! Hey, Mr. Neighbor! Hello, Mr. Andric! Going home? Going home? Come here. I've got something to tell you. Well, what is it? What is this? Why are you so serious? Did something happen? Something terrible is going to happen... I know it. You don't say... What is it? Last night I delivered a whole train of cattle-trucks. The Fascist Guards helped me. The station is full of them. They've come to take the Jews. I guess people are only talking. I don't know... I just don't like it. The whole town is talking about it. Danko! Danko! Danko! He isn't here! Good day, Mr. Andric! Have you seen my boy Danko? I haven't... I just came back from work, Mrs. Elias. He was here with Erika. They've gone off to play. He's always running off. I'll have to tie him to the kitchen table, Mr. Brtko. Would you be kind enough to tell him. If he returns, tell him the key is under the mat. - I'll be back soon. - All right. I'll tell him. I think you ought to warn the old lady. Mrs. Lautmann! Mrs. Lautmann! Mrs. Lautmann... Mrs. Laut... For God's sake! The silly old hag! Haven't you seen the old lady? What would she be doing outside? A nice goose... how much is it? 80 crowns, ma'am. Eighty? That's too much. What are you doing outside, Mrs. Lautmann? I'm buying a goose, a nice little goose. You should have told me. I could've bought it for you. What do you think of the goose? It's nice... very nice. Nice!... It's for Sabbath... and the rest of the week. The legs and wings make a nice soup, the neck stuffed with meat makes Shoulet. How much will you pay? Well... Kuchar and Brtko will be licking their lips. Mrs. Lautmann! Mrs. Lautmann! Tony! You've left the shop? They are going to steal our wares! I've been looking for you. You left without telling me. Andric has been looking for you. You've left the customers? They'll steal our goods! What were you thinking of? For God's sake, listen to me, or something terrible may happen. Andric just came to tell me... He told me that... Do I know what you're talking about? Get back to the shop! Get back to the shop! Right away! I'll be right back! What? What? You...! A nice help I've got... He'll make us all unhappy! To leave the shop unattended... Serves him right - he shouldn't stick his nose into politics! You don't know a thing about it, so give it a rest! Poor Imro! People have been talking. They met in the church yard. - But no one knows anything! Stop talking nonsense. Why don't you go and say they used to dance a Czardas? I don't feel sorry for him. - But what has he done? They are wasting their time looking for him. He surely got away this time! Brtko used to be a friend of his- he can tell you! Me? I was just as much a friend of his as you were. - Don't let anyone in! - Yes, sir! Go away, all of you! This isn't a circus or a fair! Have you seen Kuchar? Come in and listen to what Belko has come to tell us. Shut the door behind you! Hello, Tony! He brought me a written order - from the Commander's office. I asked him which commander. There's one on every corner. All right, so what is it you have? And he said: "Mr. Balko - your band will turn up in full dress uniforms on Saturday!" "Why?" I said - and he said to me: "You'll be playing for the Jews to cheer up their departure!" He wanted a band... my band... The bastard! He's made a mistake, our Marian! He'll never get my band, never! I swear to God - never! Nowadays, everything's possible, Mr. Brtko... everything. You don't believe me? Read this. Pay attention... your dear brother-in-law wrote me. For 40 years I've shaved people here... cut their hair. 40 years... a ton of hair. A barn full of hair. And now? I've been marked like a piece of cattle... branded, blackened. My property has been requisitioned, all according to the law, of course. And in the end, this. Piti Batchi was mad to have lost his job. I wish I was in his place. Now he has another. He takes the call-up cards to every Jew. But I didn't tip him for bringing mine. I... I don't get it. You are a clever man, Mr. Katz. What's happening? I am not clever - and this hasn't been sudden. I don't know... I don't understand. But I'm sure of one thing: when the laws go against innocent people - that's the end! The end of those who passed them. And you... Mr. Katz? Are you really going? Mr. Brtko, tell me I'm packing for a Sunday picnic. Haven't you seen the armed guards in town and everywhere? What else do you want? Do you want me to form a battalion with old Mr. Blau - Mrs. Lautmann and myself and attack the Fascist Guards? Would you join us, Mr. Brtko? I... I have to be going. I only thought that next Wednesday... just like this week. Yes, my friend, this is the end of our sweet little business arrangement! But, of course... one never knows. People have been saying we'll be back in the autumn! In autumn... I bet. Well - goodbye then, Mr. Katz. Goodbye, Brtko. We have to hope that our dear Lord will send you crowds of customers... to make up for your loss. Watch yourself, Mr. Brtko! Well, didn't I predict that? We are Slovaks born and bred, none of us will come empty handed out of this. Fight to the death, fight hard - till Slovaks rule their own country. Left - one, two! Fight to the death, fight hard - until Slovaks rule in Slovakia. ...and the Prophet took off his robe. My assistant will love his Sabbath dinner... and the Prophet took off his robe. What is it? Mrs. Lautmann? - Are you out of your mind? - Let me see! Wanting me to search through official documents... Someone may see us. Mrs. Lautmann? I haven't got her card... maybe they forgot her. - Shall I ask them? - Fool! What are you going to do? Hide her? What do you mean, hide her? Make pickles of her? If you get something for her promise you'll show it to me. And not a word to the old lady, do you hear? March! Get down! - Get up! - Waste no time on him! Didn't you hear the orders, you swine? Move on! Push him down! I AM A JEW-LOVER Take him away! Go home! Go home! Good Sabbath... You promised to find out where she keeps the gold. You don't know anything! You haven't checked within the walls, or pulled up the floors! What do you do, all day long? Why did you take your tools along? The old hag will take her gold to the grave! And us? I warned you: do something, make her tell you! Don't trust her. Make her tell you where she hides her wealth! Tell me what we are going to do? You clumsy fool! You! Tony! Tony! For God's sake, you're out of your mind! Why are you beating me? You, you hitting me? You? Me? Tony! You pig! You swine! You brute! Leave me alone! I'll keep quiet. I won't say a word! Tony! Tony! Tony! My dear. Tony! My Tony!... Tony! It's easy for one person to disappear. Maybe we could find a place to hide her in... a barn... a wine cellar... or in a town where she could hide. - Ludwig! - Two more? Wait! Bring the whole bottle! But we'd have to do it today... tonight, I mean... well? What? Do what you think is right. It's a shame to stick your nose into such business. Let this be a warning to you! We are going to catch all Jew-Bolshevists, Freemasons, plutocrats and other riff-raff and have no mercy on them. The commander said: we've caught that bird Kuchar already, now we'll put him into a nice little cage, to show him off, and later we'll shoot him like a dog - or hang him! Or both! - Bravo! - Attention! Follow me! You'll see something you've never seen! Music! My favorite tune! An old lady, an old lady... stepped out on the street. Hello, Mr. Brtko! Why are you here all alone? No one can hide from me. Kuchar didn't escape either. Come with us! You'll see something you've never seen yet! This is my big day! Everyone has to follow me today - and those who won't - we'll take along! Seems we'll have to go too. Leave me alone! Come on... it's best if we go too. Give me a cow, give me a cow, and a white horse rosemary and lilies have white blossoms Attention, everybody! One, two, three! Ah! Quiet! Hush up! I'll have you arrested - you drunks! Quiet! Look at this! Look at the monument of our victory! How beautiful it is! How tall! It's ours! It's like a picture of a Saint - with a halo... The enemy. It's up to you to decide what to do with her. I don't want her on my conscience. Victory is ours! We'll get rid of our enemies! Chase all the Jews out of town! That plague! We'll hang out a white flag as a sign of our victory! A white flag as a sign of our victory - and the monument to shine into the night - our eternal monument will shine forever! We are Slovaks born and bred none of us will come empty handed out of this, fight to the death, fight hard, till Slovaks rule in Slovakia Mrs. Lautmann! Mrs. Lautmann! Oh, dear God! Who is it? Terrible things are going on. Mrs. Lautmann... I've come to warn you. Terrible things... they'll be taking you away tomorrow. You've been drinking! I have... I have... but you have to hide! To hide! Do you hear me? Do you understand? You must hide... while there is still time! He's drunk. Of course I'll hide you... come... go into the shop. I'll join you! The trouble I have. My beloved has written a letter that I should come to see her to Ruzomberok my beloved, you are calling me in vain, I have to stay in the army, I can't go away Don't turn the lights on! For God's sake - what are you doing, Mrs. Lautmann? Is this for me? I don't want... I didn't come to... Don't you worry... Such things happen to the young and to the old. People have quarreled, people will quarrel again. That's life... it happens to the best people. You don't understand! No one chased me away. It's you I am worried about! Did I ask you what happened? I didn't and you don't have to tell me. Nothing! Not a word. A hard bed, but you can stand it for one night. You'll go to sleep and tomorrow things will be all right again. But you must do something! They'll take you away! Tomorrow, you'll go back to your wife. You'll make up - people always do. Good night! Oh God... What shall I do? I won't go! Go home... your wife is waiting! Slovak is my native language, Slovak is my song. Suddenly everything seems so quiet - doesn't it? You could have brushed off your hat! Never mind the hat! Everything is so quiet - don't you think so? You are dreaming. It was only a bad dream. Maybe you are right... it must have been a bad dream. To have a peaceful heart, my boy, that's a gift from God. You sound like a Prophet, Mrs. Lautmann. I always liked you, Mrs. Rosalie. Tony! I am not going to cook today. We'll go to Grunspan's for some bean-soup. It was a terrible dream - like a weight on my heart. We all have our sorrows. We all know the past - and no one knows the future. Do you know - I've always feared that wooden structure most... That tower of Babel - Now, did it stand here or didn't it? Don't you worry, my boy! Fear was the root of all evil! Once we are no longer afraid of each other. Do you hear the bells...? Are you sure that's the cause of it? Silence! Silence! In the name of your Jewish God! Quiet! Stand where you've been told to! Stay where you are! Wait your turn! Now listen, Jews! For your own sake - Hold out your registration cards! We are going to call your names! In alphabetic order! Good morning and good Sabbath! Did you sleep well, my boy? For God's sake - what shall I do with you, Mrs. Lautmann? No... don't thank me. Well, go and eat your breakfast. Just a cup of coffee and a small cake. Eat, drink... there's plenty of time. It's Saturday... and then you'll go home. I'll have to get dressed! Eat your breakfast! Whoever carries more than the allotted 30 kilos allowed will lose everything! Attention! Attention! Whoever is found with fire arms, knives or any sharp instruments will be punished on the spot - according to the Martial Law! Do you understand? I repeat: Whoever is found with fire arms, knives or any sharp instrument will be punished according to Martial Law - on the spot! Jesus! We have to open the shop! Mr. Brtko! For God's sake - haven't you seen my Danko? What's all this? Get away! I haven't seen him since yesterday, Mrs. Elias. Mr. Brtko! Please! Move along! Get out of here, I tell you! I've lost my son... If you see him, send him. - Move it! - Oh God, if we've lost him... Move it, before I get mad! Step up and have your luggage weighed! Abeles Henrik! Abeles Henrik! Abeles Rosa - Abeles Rudolph! Abeles Clara - Abeles Clara! Adam Adolf - Adam Rosa What have I ever done to deserve this? Have you gone mad? To open my shop on a Saturday? Saturday... This is a different kind of Saturday. Don't come near here! Don't even poke your nose around the corner or we are finished! Are you giving me orders... in my own shop? You... you. I'm not giving you orders... I want to save you. You drunkard. Don't come back on Monday! All right, I won't I don't want to see you here again! All right! All right! You drunkard... you... you! The following: Akermann Ferdinand Akermann Ester! Akermann Ester? Well? Come on, come on. Altmann Leopold Altmann Luise Altmann Jacob Altmann Charlotte Amsel Salomon Amsel Magda Baumhaft Arthur. The old hag... The old hag. Baumhaft Bella. Baumhaft Charlotte. Where did you hide her? She's there, praying. Maybe it's for the best. - Have you heard anything? - No, I've been thinking. Your brother-in-law might have made an exception - with your Jewess. - What exception? Now more than ever, you need good connections. You are stupid, Piti Batchi. I'm not. Keep quiet and you'll see. The storm will blow over. Don't go away! Stay here! Don't let anyone see her. You're lucky to have such a brother-in-law! Elias Elias... Elias Ludmila... Elias Joseph... Elias Hannah You don't know my brother-in-law! Elias Daniel! Elias Daniel! How can he have disappeared? Go and find him! ...according to paragraph one I appoint Anthony Brtko... manager of the Jewish shop Lautmann. Na straz! Yes. You'll be a rich man by tomorrow. You can throw your carpenter's tools out the window. A rich man! A rich man. Fool! He still owes me for the ladder! The baker too! Who? I don't know him... You bastards! Katz? What has Katz done to you? For shaving your ungrateful face? You scoundrels! Dirty, stinking fascist guards! I swear... I swear Mrs. Lautmann, they are not going to harm you. I won't let them! I won't let them, do you hear? God have mercy on us... Mercy, mercy... Go and see for yourself! Be quiet and sit on your chair! Quiet! Shut up! Not a sound. No one will see you, no one will hear you. I'll take care of everything, do you hear? It shall be settled before Sabbath... Everything will be all right. Damn the fascist guards. Na straz! Jews, listen to me! Our laws are kind... Though you are of different religion, we are not going to harm you! But we shall punish everyone who dares to oppose the law! Jew or not! Jew lover is worse than Jew. He is no Jew but helps them... Don't panic, don't be afraid... There is a war and you are being put to work in labor camps. Bastard! You wanted to trap me? Now I know... Your children will go to school. Everyone will work in his trade. Old people will be sent to homes. You are going by train... The camp isn't far... This is the truth... Look at him! He hasn't closed the shop! What's going on!? Blau... Mrs. Elias... Mittelmann... children... luggage... shouting... Where are they going? Is this the end of the world? I don't understand... What's happening out there? I do not understand. Do you hear what I am asking? Why are you staring at me? Come here! Come! Guards! Organize departure! Hurry! Come! Do you hear! Put the luggage on the trucks! Hurry up, hurry up! It's either me or her! She has to go! She has to go. She has to go. Start packing Mrs. Lautmann while there is still time! I'll help... You can take 30 pounds... 30 pounds is a lot... Go and register... They will send you home! What would they want of you? They need the young people. Take some food... Have I gone mad or is he mad? You are drunk since yesterday... It's Saturday and you opened the shop to spite me! Now you come and pack my things! You shout at me, you scare me! What's going on? Tell me, what's going on? How should I know? Ask them what is going on! What have I done? I never wished anything bad for anyone! I'm nothing. I can't hurt anyone! But you... old maid, you don't understand... We repeat that you won't be going far, only to labor camps. We've all got to work, this is the law! Do you hear? Do you see? Do you hear? I don't understand... That's the law! It can't be helped! I don't understand... That's the law. It can't be helped. A kind law... But I don't understand... I don't understand either! Don't worry, Mrs. Lautmann - it won't be bad. You will go and they will check-up and say: "She is too old!" You can tell them you are deaf and lame and ill! Come on. Don't be afraid. You want to say goodbye to your neighbors? Do you think they will prepare a special train for you? What, what? A transport! Do you think they'll send a special one for you? What, transport? Watch. The Jews are being deported. All of them! Do you think they are going to keep you here? Mrs. Lautmann, I beg you. In the name of the Almighty... and your Moses and all the saints... don't force me to throw you out. Shall I shout even louder right into your ears or what? Kuchar! Where is Kuchar? They've beaten him up terribly... like a dog... they've called him a Jew-lover. A white Jew. Do you know what that means? A Jew... A Jew... Jews... a pogrom? - What? - A pogrom. Mrs. Lautmann, don't run, wait. Mrs. Lautmann, damn you! Mrs. Lautmann, are you there? Open the door. If I wanted to, I could... Let me in, open the door! You won't? I know you're in there! I know you are not deaf. I know you are only pretending - you old maid. You are pretending so you can tell after the war that I was a cruel manager. An arisator. An arisator. Here you are, you old maid. You thought that by locking yourself in you'll be safe, that I couldn't get in. You are wrong. I know you are not deaf. You are only pretending. You will go like all the rest. You'll go! It's not my fault, Mrs. Lautmann. It's either you or me. I can't help it. May God forgive you your sins and mine too. Let's go, let's go! There - that's where you are going, you old hag. You must! You must! You must! Get out immediately! Go! You must! You must! I... I... I didn't... Forgive me. Forgive me, Mrs. Lautmann. I didn't want. I really didn't... I didn't want. I only thought... But you don't have to worry... it's all over now. I must close the shop! For God's sake, Mrs. Lautmann, Kolkocky is coming. - You must hide, quickly! - I have to close the shop! What's the shop to you - now? I knew it... hide! Go away, quickly! Let me go - let me go! Go away, go away! You are mad! For God's sake - go away! The police! I don't want them to shoot me! Save me, save me! Police! Mrs. Lautmann - you can come out now! It's all right... Mrs. Lautmann... what happened? Mrs. Lautmann! Jesus! Mrs. Lautmann... Mrs... Oh! Where have you been all day! Danko - come! Essenc!
