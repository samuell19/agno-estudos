(film reel clicks) (ominous electronic music) (birds chirp) (dramatic rumbling) (birds flit) (water splashes) (bulldozers rumble) (debris clatters) (sand rushes) (earth rumbles) (suspenseful orchestral music) (creature growls) (creature growls) (explosion booms) - Man. This don't look good. The heck with this. (creature growls) (bottle clatters) (megaconda screeches) (man screams) (midtempo electronic music) (birds chirp) (water rushes) - What do you think we got trapped today, Hoke? A possum? Maybe a raccoon? - Maybe a bobcat, Jerry. I don't know. Quiet. - I've never ate no bobcat before. What's that taste like? - Chicken. Now keep it down, will ya? - What are you so worried about? - I don't want that damn ranger to catch us up here like last time! - That can't happen. - The hell it can't! - Don't you read the paper? Ranger budget got cut last month by the feds. He's all packed up and gone. - So who's in charge? They got to send somebody up here to catch poachers. - Like us? - Yes, Jerry, like us. - Well, Sheriff Carey's got jurisdiction. - Wayne Carey? Hell. I taught Wayne Carey everything he knows about setting traps up here years ago. Wayne Carey ain't gonna cause us no problems. Come on, Jerry. You go check them big traps up there. I'm gonna keep on going out. (suspenseful orchestral music) Damn. (megaconda hisses) (dramatic music) (trap snaps) - No, no! (megaconda growls) - Jerry! Jerry! Jerry! Jerry! Damn it, Jerry. Whoa, Jerry. - Mornin'. - Hey, Dad. - How do you stomach that stuff? - Wendy turned me on to it. - Is that the new girlfriend? - She's into wheat germ and tofu and all that stuff. - So naturally, you're into wheat germ and tofu and all that stuff. - Well, I'm trying. - Do you like it? - No comment. - She must be awful cute. Who's her dad? - Steve Armstrong. - Yeah, I do know who she is. She is awful cute. - She's okay. - Is something the matter, son? - I was thinkin' about Mom. Today's the day, you know, three years ago. - Yeah, I know. I think about your mom every day. Hey, what do you say we go to Mary Jane's Cafe and get some real breakfast? - I can't, Dad. They'll be here soon. We're gonna head up to Boulder Canyon and try out my new video camera. - Eh, tofu, bacon and eggs. (laughs) Just be careful. And don't forget, stop by the TV station on your way out, and check see about that job. - I will. - Hey, be careful! (birds chirp) (midtempo country music) - Hoke, you look like you've been up all night. Have you seen a ghost or somethin'? - Has that dang Jerry been in here? - No, I haven't seen him since last Thursday. He paid his tab. - Maybe I did see a ghost. Or what's left of one. Mary Jane, give me a shot of somethin'. - Honey, you know I can't sell liquor till afternoon. - I ain't buyin'. - Well, I guess I ain't breaking the law if I just give it to you. - (sighs) Thanks. - Good mornin'. - Morning. - Mornin', sheriff. - Jake Deveroe. It's been a while. - Yeah, it has. It's nice to be back in my own home town. How long you been back? - About a week. It's my signature on those construction papers. - Yeah, I thought I recognized the name. Stay out of trouble, okay? Good morning, beautiful. - Good morning. Whatcha gonna have? - I'm gonna have two eggs over easy, toast, bacon, and a big cup of coffee with cream. - The usual. (Mary Jane and Wayne laugh) Okay. - Sheriff. I had a man disappear off the job site last night up in Boulder Canyon. He stayed behind to do some grading after the rest of the crew left, and he didn't check in. - Boulder Canyon? Well nobody's reported anything, Jake. It was Friday night. It's payday, right? Maybe your guy just wandered off for the first beer of the weekend. - Well, he didn't pick up his paycheck, either. - Willard Parker's paying for this venture. I guess at what Willard pays, he probably would've needed that envelope by now. - Willard Parker pays a fair day's wage for a full day's work. - Well that's not what I've been hearing, Jake. Your guy probably quit on you. You and Willard have to expect this kind of thing. I have no problem with what you guys are doing, but you can't come into this town and do business on the cheap. I'm tellin' you that as a friend. - Friend. That's a good one. We haven't been friends since you stole my girlfriend. - I didn't steal your girlfriend, Jake. I married her. - And you got her killed, too. Oh, I'm sorry Wayne. You weren't driving that car, were you? My point is, that my man did not just walk off that job. I think there's something bad going on up in Boulder Canyon. - Something is, and that's for sure. - Isn't it a little early to be drinkin', Hoke? - Believe me, this morning, I need it. - All right, put your bottle down, tell me what's going on. (engine hums) (midtempo instrumental music) - Well, we got the entire day to kill. See ya! (birds chirp) - Beautiful, isn't it? - I love you. - I'm just not big on four letter words. - I knew that would scare you. - Thank you, darlin'. - You're quite welcome. - Look here, I saw what I could, and I heard the rest. The fact is, Jerry is missin'. - Swear to me that you're not just drunk, Hoke. - You think what you want, sheriff. But I was sober enough to find this. (midtempo country music) - All right, all right. I'll take a drive up there and see what I can find. Give me about half an hour to finish my breakfast. Then both of you meet me out by my car, all right? - All right. (gentle orchestral music) - I guess this is what they call progress. - It's like seeing your childhood playground all torn up. - Couldn't have been more than a few days ago. This was all fresh dirt. - There's been a fire up there. - Maybe. Looks like a smaller, controlled blaze. Burn all the brush and clear the land as fast as possible. (door thuds) - Is he here, Tina? - He is here. Somebody's gotta keep an eye on things around here. You look lovely today, Tina. Now make yourself scarce. (Tina and Willard chuckle) You thought I forgot, huh? - I'm going swimming. - Looks like an expensive pool. - This is for later. I have dresses to buy. - No, you have dresses to model. State Businessman's Association is next month, and all you gotta do is look pretty. (Tina laughs) While I con them into nominating me to be their next president. - Hm, I know how to make man say yes to almost anything. (Tina chuckles) - She's expensive, but she's worth it. - Oh, I bet she is. - To keep a woman like that, you gotta have fame, fortune, or a very good story. - Let me guess. - Well, I don't need the fame. My story's much too painful to repeat. - Well, you certainly are getting top quality for your dollar. - Yep, keep your hands off her, Jake. She'll eat you alive. There won't be a bone left for the buzzards. - I know women like that. A man can't help but look. - Yeah, well you best keep your eyes on my other property. Ones I'm paying you to take care of. Now, is there something you wanna tell me? - Yeah. We had a little trouble up at the job site last night. I lost one of my men. - See, I warned you about hiring undocumented workers. - Now, they're good workers. I just can't afford to pay union rates. - Well you get what you pay for, Jake. - I like hiring 'em. They're hard working people. - That's 'cause they ain't going anywhere. - Well, i think some of them already have. - Have what? - Gone somewhere. You know this local character, Hoke? - Hogan? Yeah, I know him, what about him? - Well, he was up there this morning with a buddy, and apparently his buddy just disappeared. Just like my worker. - Well, maybe he was drinkin', and he just wandered off. - No, no, see I don't think so. I was talkin' to Sheriff this morning-- - Whoa, whoa, whoa. Now you tellin' me you brought the sheriff in on this? On my private business? - I didn't know what else to do. That's the law, missing persons, whatever. I just stopped by to tell you that the sheriff's heading up there in about 15 minutes. - Well then what the hell are you doing here? You better get up there right now. Make sure nothing else goes wrong. - Yes, sir. (door thuds) (eerie electronic music) (water rushes) (birds chirp) - Looks like a controlled burn. (camera beeps) But fast and dangerous. - I'm sure they used some kind of accelerant. - Hang on a second, keep shooting. - What is it? - Gasoline. (dramatic orchestral music) - Awesome! Guys, hey, check this out! Guys, I'm tractor man, eh! Come on, guys! Look, ha-ha! Man, look at this! Yeah! Guys, guys, there's an awesome tractor over there. - Whatever, Tractor Man, let's go. - Aw, see he saw, he saw my tractor man. - Yeah, I saw. - Yeah, you think if I got like the suit and the hat and everything maybe I could drive that thing? - [Wendy] Yeah. - Guys, that would look cool! Yeah. - Anybody need a new shirt? (giggles) Aw, sick. - Ah no, pick it back up. - It's bloody. - it's evidence. Go on, pick it up. - It's disgusting. - Hey guys. Check it out. (laughs) (young man thuds) Whoa. - Look what this neander-brain just did. - Guys. - [Ross] What is it? - Uh, some kind of prehistoric reptile, maybe? - We are about to find out. I don't know, I think I missed that class. Um, it does look prehistoric. - Cool. - It's not just cool, it's the remains of a prehistoric creature found in a rock. - So what? - So it means this place could qualify as an important paleontological site. - So? - So we should probably bring this to Evie at the TV station. - Okay. (eerie orchestral music) (engine rumbles) (birds chirp) - Sheriff, look what we found. - That's my man's shirt. He wore this every day. - I'm gonna need that for evidence. - See sheriff, it's all gone, just like Jerry. - Can't you see what they're doing here, Dad? This is a big story. Grading, burning brush, half the trees are gone. - It's all legal, Ross. - How is it legal? - City never owned this property, we just leased it. When the lease ran out, we seized it by right of eminent domain. - Eminent domain? - It's a law allowing the government to take over the land for their greater good. So assuming the city now controls the land, why doesn't it revert back to being a park? - 'Cause the city can't afford to maintain it, so they sold it to my boss. - What's he going to build? - A strip mall. - In the middle of a park? - Yeah I don't know. The place is zoned for residential. They'll probably put up a nice little housing development, give you kids some new neighbors to play with. - I'm not a friggen kid. - Can't somebody file a formal grievance? What about the land records down at county seat? How hard did the city try to find the real owner? - We're not here to land survey, Ross. I'm investigating two missing persons. I haven't been here since I was a kid. You guys mind showing me around? - Oh sure. - Are you coming? - No, I'm gonna find my man. I'll catch you later. (ominous orchestral music) Hey folks! Mornin'! - Good morning. - Listen, this is private property, so I'm gonna need you guys to turn around and head back the way you came. - I've been coming up here since I was a kid. - No, I hear you, I hear you, it's just the new owner, he doesn't want any trespassers, so. - Dude, we're not gonna hurt anything. We're hiking. (gun clicks) - We have a right to hike through here. You can't stop us. - I said take off. - All right, let's go, guys. - Oh no, wait, hey guys, the road's back this way. Screw it, I am not a security guard. (midtempo electronic music) - [Hiker] Yeah! - Ah, thank you. - You're welcome. (creature growls) What was that? - I don't know. Maybe that guy's following us or something. - I don't see anything. (dramatic music) (woman screams) (megaconda crunches) (megaconda growls) (megaconda growls) - Wow, this is beautiful. Thanks for showing me around. Hoke, I don't see anything unusual up here. - Sheriff, my traps are just on the other side of that ridge, now that is where I last saw Jerry. - All right. Hoke and I are gonna go take a look up there. I'll meet you back in town. You can lead the way. - Now you're talkin'. (car doors thud) (ominous music) Right here. This eh. I looked all over, this is all I found. - This is the last place you saw him? - Yeah. This is it. - What's that smell? - Holy moly! Phew! - What do you think it is? - Looks like a shedding. - Shedding of what? - A big damn snake! - help me get it down to the truck. I think I need to make some phone calls. Careful, don't touch it. - Who was that? - Sheriff Wayne, he wants to see you. - Well that can't be good. What else did he say? - He wants to see you down at the diner right away, and I don't know, do you still love me? - Of course I still love you. - Then when do I get to go into the city? - What do you need to go to the city for? - I have dresses to buy, remember? - Why don't you just by 'em in town? - You want me to dress like I my wardrobe at a bait shop. Oh, tie a flannel shirt around my waist maybe? Mm, little pair of Daisy Dukes, Shady Brady hat upon my head, chewin' a piece of straw? - Enough, I get the picture. - So, when do I get to go into the city? - I don't know, how about next weekend? - How about you give me the keys to one of your cars, and I drive myself. - How about you get dressed, and you drive both of us. (eerie electronic music) - Hey, what happened to you today? - I had some business to take care of. - Well did you see or hear anything unusual? - Not a thing, why? - Some of my better customers are pukin' in their hashbrowns because of that thing over there. - I'm sorry Mary Jane. I brought it in because I wanted Doc Brown to take a look at it, and I thought he might be here. I promise you, I'll take it with me as soon as I leave. - Jake, don't leave till I tell ya. We need to talk. Babe, why don't you wait over there for me, all right? So you wanted to see me, sheriff? - You want some coffee or something? - No thanks. Look, I'd love to spend a day talkin' about the price of corn with you, but I am a busy man, even on a Saturday, so can we get to the point? - I'm shutting down your job site at Boulder Canyon. - Shuttin' it down for what? - I'm investigating to missing persons up there. - I don't think I need to remind you that I'm fully permitted. - This has nothing to do with permits, Willard. It's a matter of public safety. - Boy, oh boy. You know, sheriff, I'm pretty unpopular around here. And you know, when you're unpopular, people start pullin' little tricks on ya, little pranks on ya, and that's what this is. Some local pullin' a prank to shut down my business. - All right, why don't we just cut the crap. You're a local too, Willard. Yeah, there's a lot of people that aren't happy about you tearin' up that park, but you and I both know there's not a single person in this town that's gonna break the law to try and stop you. - Well, obviously there is. You just haven't found him yet. - I'm starting this investigation. And your job site's top of my list. (Willard scoffs) - That just figures, don't it? I mean this is the thanks I get for helpin' out around here. - I don't think you've ever helped anybody but yourself, just like your daddy did. You know, this is land that folks take their children to to play. It's public land! - That's it right there. See, it's not public land anymore, it's my land. - It was our land, and you stole it. - Now Mary Jane, I love you. But you know, I got enough problems without ordering off your menu. (midtempo country music) - Willard, you're shut down until I say you're not. Your work crew doesn't come back till Monday, right? I promise you I'll do everything I can to try and resolve this before then. - Yeah well I can't wait till Monday. Tina! You, Jake, I wanna see you at my house, half an hour. - You're the boss. - What do you think he'll do? - Governor's one of his best friends, he'll get my work ban lifted. - Just like that? - Just like that. - Son of a bitch. (Wayne laughs) How about takin' that stinkin' thing outta here for me? It's gotta be a health hazard or something huh? - I'll write myself a citation before I leave, how about that? - Oh good, thank you. (uptempo electronic music) - Hey Ross, hey Andy. - Hey. - Hey, Evie. - Great, Evie Chapman, famous TV news anchor. - In the flesh. This is Todd Pinker, my new shooter. Ross, Andy. - Hey man. - What's up, guys? - Be nice to these kids, Todd. They're our groupies. We don't get a lot of groupies out in the 47th broadcast market. - 48th. - Don't push it. - Nice to meet you all. So what brings you guys up here today? You just wanna hang out and watch a newscast or something? - Actually, we've been doing a little reporting of our own. - Ooh, some big scandal brewing at Boulder High? - School's out for the summer. We just graduated. - I know. - Evie's messing with us. She always does that. - Ross has been coming here since grade school watching what we do. He learns quick. He might have my job one day. - I'd rather have Todd's. - Hey. - [Evie] Wait, you might be in luck. - What do you mean? - Well, the boss says we could use a kid like you if you'll work for cheap. We could do with a stringer for the high school football coverage. - That means I get all the good stuff, you get all the crap. (Evie and Todd laugh) - Wow, that sounds good to me. - Just come by Monday, and I'll introduce you, but I'm not promising anything, okay? - Evie wait, like I said, we need to talk to you about something. - Okay guys, but make it quick. - I have some tape to show you. - Oh sorry kids, we got a soccer match to cover. - Please, it'll take a minute. - We're already late, Eve. - We just can't. - Come on. Just take it as a personal request from one of your groupies. - All right, whadya got? (ominous electronic music) (megaconda growls) (suspenseful instrumental music) (megaconda growls) (megaconda growls) Well, it is my favorite type of hot news story. Evil contractors raping the land, helped by corrupt officials in high places, treasure trove of prehistoric fossils, and all speculation from a group of kids fresh out of high school. It's a recipe for a liability suit, I'm sorry. - So we just give up. - I'll tell you what, after the soccer match, Todd and I will swing out to Boulder Canyon and see what we can find. If there's a story there, I'll do a live remote from the site, and we'll feed the footage back to the station. Mind you, I will not be making accusations on the air. I have a career to uphold. - I understand. Can I help with the write? - You already have. - Yes, this is Willard Parker, I'd like to speak to the governor please. Yes, I know it's Saturday, but you tell him it's Willard Parker, and I'll hold. Thank you. - We have to be discreet. - Discreet, we're in the house with him. - I didn't mean here. - Oh, okay. Maybe we should just head up to the job site. A lot of local kids go up there and park. - I don't wanna go to that canyon. - Why not? - Wild critters make me nervous. - Excuse me, would you mind excusing us Tina? - You got a hell of a mess up there, boss. - Well why aren't you up there cleanin' it up? - [Jake] I think the sheriff's got everything pretty much under control. - Well it's not the sheriff's job to get that site ready for Monday morning. - What do you want me to do? - I want you to get up there and make sure those trespassers stay off my property. - Look, I am not a security guard. - Well, you're not gonna have a job Monday morning either if we don't get this problem fixed. Now maybe you should spend a little more time watchin' over my business affairs and spend a little less time watchin' my wife. - You're the one with the eye candy, Willard. Maybe you ought to spend a little less time flaunting it around if you don't want people lookin'. - Get back to work. - How dare you? Sometimes I hate you. - Oh yeah? Don't forget where I found you. - How could I? You won't let me. - What's gotten into you, Tina? - I don't know. I just, can't think straight. - Well you don't need to think. You just need to look pretty. You leave the thinkin' to me. (traffic hums) - I wanna report two people dead. (woman thuds) (water rushes) (suspenseful instrumental music) - Iverson Point. - I remember when this place caught fire. About two years ago. You could see the smoke all the way from town. (birds chirp) We used to come up here and try to get the old man all riled. We'd shoot his garden full of BBs, or throw rocks at the shed, and he'd come out with that big ol' .20 gauge shotgun and run us off his property. - He could've shot and killed you. - No, not a chance. He was carrying rock salt though. I did get shot in the butt once, though. That burned like hell. They say that old man died in this fire. - That's what I heard, too. (gentle orchestral music) I really liked your speech. I'm Anna. - You live here in Boulder Junction? - Oh, I used to, a long time ago. This is the park where me and my friends would hang out, too. - You see those bulldozers? - Yeah, you'd think they could just leave some place alone. - Especially our place. - Yeah, especially our place. - So, what do you do? - For a living? I'm a wildlife artist, and I like to share with people. I can draw pretty good, and I started getting hired by the better magazines. - This place is awesome. - It is so beautiful, peaceful. I haven't been back since I was in grade school. And now. - A strip mall. - With a gated community. - Well, welcome to the real world, guys. (dramatic instrumental music) (megaconda hisses) - Oh my god! - Come on, quick! (megaconda growls) (Wendy yelps) (gun fires) (megaconda growls) Move it! (gun fires) (suspenseful orchestral music) (megaconda growls) (gun fires) Keep going! (gun fires) (megaconda growls) I guess that bought us some time. - How did you find this place? - I used to play in this cave when I was a kid. Makes a pretty good campsite. - We're lucky we made in time. - Okay guys, listen. I hate to break up this episode of extreme cave makeovers, but just what the hell was that? - It looked to me like a big ass snake. - Impossible. They haven't been around for tens of thousands of years. Since the dinosaur age. - Well I guess someone forgot to tell him he's extinct. You guys are all 21, right? - Oh-- - Yeah. - Yes ma'am. - Yeah. - So how do we get out of here? (traffic hums) - Giant, giant snake. Giant, giant-- - [Mary Jane] Calm down. - She keeps saying giant snake. - I know. - Well I just think maybe she saw something. - Like the owner of that big skin you found? She'll sleep for while, but she needs real medical attention. - Yeah, I found out Doc Brown's out of town this weekend. - Well, then she'll just have to stay with you. (birds chirp) (ominous electronic music) (engine rumbles) - Let's start with the live remote. - [Todd] All right. - You going hand-held? - Yeah. We'll go wirelessly back to the van. - Over here, I think we should set up over here. - When I was a kid, we used to sit around the campfire and we'd tell stories about giant snakes and Bigfoot, but I've never seen anything more dangerous that a black bear up here. This, this thing's real. - A real what? - Megaconda. - You just made that up. - I didn't, I swear, I saw it on the internet last week, okay? Megaconda. - Oh, I heard about this. They found a perfectly preserved fossil in Colombia last year. - Uh, this thing is a little more than perfectly preserved. - Over the years, they actually found traces of steroids in the prehistoric sponges. I think that's that keeps the fossils preserved. Maybe that's what's keeping this thing alive. - I sketched some of the park higher up, and I saw this. It looked to me like a deep crater, but now it's got me thinking. - Its nest, maybe? - Maybe. Either way, it's best to steer clear of the area. - What killed the megaconda back in the day? - The Ice Age. - Well, assuming we don't have another Ice Age handy, what do you suggest we do about it? - We get professionals up here to kill it. - Professional what, Ross? Giant snake hunters? - No. I was thinking more along the lines of my dad. No signal. - Great. - I'm standing next to a deep crater apparently created by an intense underground explosion. The lack of wildlife in the area may indicate that a geophysical limnic eruption has taken place in Boulder Canyon. While only two such limnic eruptions have ever been recorded previously. - So we can resume work on Monday, then? And the governor will fax me the signed document? Excellent. Many thanks. All right. - [Eve] What was once a beautiful wildlife preserve. But it looks like somebody wants to change all that. There's a private contractor here grading, building, burning, clearing the land and chopping down trees. Looks like Boulder Canyon's about to go away for good. And now for a little history lesson on Boulder Canyon. The first inhabitants of Boulder Canyon were the Pueblo Indians. In the late 1800s, the Southern Pacific Railroad Company-- - I'm goin' out. - Where you goin'? - Just out for some air. - And do a little thinking. - That's right. - I love you, you know. (gentle electronic music) - I love you, too. - Eve Chapman, Six News, Boulder Canyon. - That's it. We got it. Footage is good. They got the feed clear as a bell. Back to the station? - Oh not yet. We gotta get some B-roll. There's some interesting trails up above. We'll get some footage of that, and we'll show the audience what these construction guys are about to destroy. - What are you tryin' to win another award? - Yeah. Just keep the live feed open. We'll keep pumpin' the stuff back to the station. (ominous electronic music) - One thing that puzzles me, is where this thing came from. - Maybe this park was some kind of radioactive dumping site back in the '50s. So where do you think the snake came from? - I don't know. Why don't you ask me again? Probably the construction blasting. The bulldozers might have unearthed something that had been laying dormant for thousands of years. - So you think this creature had been laying dormant in these rocks all this time? - Like that fossil we found. - It's just a wild guess. Does that really matter right now? - Well, I mean like Ross says, we have to warn the sheriff. - I'm more worried about Evie and the TV station. She's probably up here somewhere. (dramatic electronic music) - Come on, the coast is clear. Okay, so where are you guys parked? - Down at the construction site. - Wait, wait, that's the TV crew van right there. - We better find Evie and warn her. - Wait, there they are! (suspenseful electronic music) - Get that. - Yeah, I'm gonna start here, and I'm gonna go across. - All right. (plants snap and crunch) Do you hear something? - No, what? - I thought I heard a noise. - It's quiet. - It's too quiet. - Well, let's finish up so we can get outta here. - All right. - Let's go down. - Stop! - Eve! - My god, will you look at that? - Oh! - Keep shooting, keep shooting! We'll go back to the van. (megaconda growls) - Watch out! - Stop! - Run! - What is that thing? - I don't know. (TV anchor chatters) (woman screams) - [News Anchor] What appears to be a large reptile. - [Andy] Watch out! (group yells) - Whatever you do, do not stop shooting. - Okay, okay. (suspenseful music) (megaconda growls) (megaconda growls) (Eve screams) - Eve. Eve! Eve! (megaconda growls) Eve! (suspenseful electronic music) (megaconda growls) (megaconda growls) Jesus. We need some people. (megaconda growls) (Todd screams) Eat my dust, sucka! (Todd screams) (megaconda growls) - God! This is all my fault. - Don't say that. There's nothing we could've done. Let's go find your dad. - What about the cell phone? (birds chirp) - Still no signal. Dang! (midtempo electronic music) - Come on, Jack, I said get me the Air National Guard, I need a chopper. Tell 'em, tell 'em it's a code 1999. Just have him radio me when they get in here. Do it! Wonder where Ross is. - I'll give you one guess. (police radio chatters) (Willard knocks) - Sorry to interrupt you there, sheriff, but this is my order to resume work at my job site come Monday. Direct from the governor's office. - Willard, I don't give a damn about that right now. I got an emergency situation on my hands. - Well, maybe you should get out there and take care of it, eh? Got a few more people gone missing. - Who? - Well, let's see. Jake and my wife Tina, who took a walk and still hasn't come back. - Well, I saw them together. - Where? - They were in his truck headed out of town. - When was this? - About a half an hour ago. - Anything else? - No. - All right, well why don't you head home. And say there. I'll call you if I hear anything. - Yeah, call me. - He's crazy. - Yeah, something tells me I should watch him. I just don't have time. (suspenseful music) - [Mary Jane] Where'd you get that? - I took it off some teenagers a couple weeks ago. They were fishing with it. - Oh. (guns clatter) (birds chirp) - (laughs) If it bleeds, it leads. If it bleeds, it leads. (megaconda growls) (Eve screams) (engine hums) (bag rattles) - [Hoke] God damn kids! - Hey, Hoke. - What'd I do now, sheriff? - Nothin'. I just have a little job for you. - Well, I'm not really partial to work. Anything's better than collecting wages, you know that. - I think this might be right up your alley. Doing a little hunting. I need someone that can spot and shoot and who knows the area really well. - You're going back up that mountain, aren't you? - I have to. Ross is up there. - Why you do me like that, sheriff? I don't like it. (midtempo electronic music) But if you need me, I will go with you. - I need you. - Does this job pay? - No. - Well, I had to ask. (engine rumbles) (engine sputters) - Damn it. - What's this? Outta gas? That's an old trick, baby. - Babe, believe me, I wish it was that simple. - One kiss first? Come on, one kiss. - I'll be right back, don't go anywhere. (door thuds) Ow. (plants snap and crunch) Now what is it? - I told you. Nature makes me jumpy. - All right, check this out. Come on. Is that better? - Oh yes. Hurry, Jake. Hurry. - Yeah, hurry Jake, hurry. You don't wanna keep the lady waiting. - Honey. Honey please don't. - Honey. Now what was that you said to me in the house? Oh yes, I love you, too. - I do love you, honey, I do. - Well, you got a funny way of showin' it. - W-w-wait, wait, Mr. Parker, you got me all wrong. She has been begging me to bring her out here. She's been all over me. She said she was fixin' to leave you, honest. A man just can't ignore that. - Yeah, how about I blow out the base of your stomach? Maybe that'll give you something else to think about. - Do it, honey! Jake's lying. He made me come out here. I think he was gonna rape me. He's been pawing at me behind your back ever since he came to work for you. - She's a lyin' whore. - Shut up, both of you. (gun clicks) Nice try, Jake. (Willard crunches) (Tina screams) (Tina sobs) (Jake moans) (megaconda growls) (suspenseful orchestral music) (megaconda screeches) - No! (Jake crunches) (engine rumbles) - Dad! - Ross, Ross! Are you okay, are you okay? - I couldn't reach you. - Yeah, but what are you doin' up here? - There's not enough time in the world for you to believe, but I'm about to tell you-- - No no, I know, there's a giant snake up here, we saw it on TV. - Where's the news crew? - Dead. We, we-- - We were up here investigating Mr. Parker's land grab, and this giant snake just appeared out of nowhere. - Now okay, is everybody okay, is everybody all right? - What are you gonna do? - I made Hoke a deputy. We're gonna go up and kill that thing. - You're gonna need help. - Not from you. - We spent the friggen day with it, sheriff. - The point is, Dad, we've been up here all day. We know more than anyone else about this thing. - Which ain't diddly squat, boy. - Look, the point is to kill this thing as fast as we can, right, before it gets out of the canyon? You need our help. - You're right. I'm proud of you, son. - Do you mind if I join your posse? - Do I have a choice? - No, but those guns aren't gonna do the job in bringing this thing down. - That's why I brought dynamite. - I don't know how your wife puts up with you. - My wife isn't around anymore. - Are we gonna stand around yackin' or are we gonna go up there and shoot that paper-hanging son of a bitch? - Hello, what about us? - You are officially B team! You stay by the car and man the radio in case something happens. You understand? - Yeah, I understand. I don't like it. (suspenseful electronic music) (megaconda growls) - You think that thing is still around here? - Maybe not. But I can smell it. I always leaves that awful smell, like something vomited out of the earth. - Just like that snake skin I left behind. All right. Let's move on out. (megaconda growls) (megaconda growls) All right. Let's take a five-minute break. Remember what I taught you about gun safety? - Yeah, don't aim it anything you don't plan on shooting. - That's right. Anybody have any ideas where this thing might be? - Up. Anna says there's a crater up there that might be its nest. (midtempo electronic music) - Wait! (guns click) - Whoa, hold it. Tina, are you all right? - Willard. He's dead. Jake's dead, too. He tried to feed me to that thing. - You think it went into town? - No, it's still here. - It likes people. - It likes to eat them. - Yeah, and there's still plenty of us here to eat. - Maybe it's in its den. - Come on. (suspenseful electronic music) - I hate this waiting. - Think they're okay? (helicopter whirs) - Haven't heard any gunshots. - Hey, look! - Canyon base, this is National Guard recon flight 87 alpha, can you read, over. - This is canyon base reading you loud and clear, 87 Alpha. - Roger that. (helicopter whirs) - He's coming in too low! Hey! - Come on! (megaconda growls) (megaconda thuds) - Ooh, what the hell was that? - Oh no. Oh no. - Oh my god. (dramatic suspenseful music) (helicopter whirs) - Jesus Christ! Mayday, mayday! (explosion booms) (megaconda screeches) - [Andy] Come on! (megaconda growls) - I think it's on the move! I know where he's going. (ominous electronic music) - Anyone know where we are? - [Ross] I don't think we ever went this high before. - I came up and down this road earlier today. Just keep going that way. Okay, you see this road? That's where I saw the crater. Now, the road goes to the right. We're gonna follow that road, and if we're lucky, we'll see the nest on the top of the rocky peak. - Where are we going with this, what's the plan? - We're gonna go up there and shoot the bastard full of holes! Right, sheriff? - I don't know, Hoke. I'm kinda playin' this by ear right now. - Bullets may not do much more than piss it off. - We pump enough lead into it, I guarantee you it's gonna slow it down a whole lot. Plus we got that dynamite of yours, shove some of that down its throat, it's gonna give it a bad case of indigestion. - I have an idea. What if we cave everything in on top of it. - What are you talking about? - Hold on, let him finish. - Anna says there's a crater up there. Maybe with a nest in it, right? - It's a deep hole, for sure. It might attract an animal that size. - We might be able to catch it off guard. - Right, so why don't we set charges around the crater. The explosion would knock all that dirt and rock in on top of him. Kill the snake and everything else inside it, and seal it forever. - No, I don't like this idea. - No, no, she's right. It's too dangerous. Snakes have a really keen sense of hearing and vibration. If we go around stomping up there it's gonna be like ringing the dinner bell. - We don't have another choice. My idea may be the only one that'll work. - Let's go take a look. - Oh! - Get up. - No, no I can't. I think I sprained my ankle. - Come on, you can make it. - Give me a minute! - Listen, my boyfriend is up there chasing a monster. Your best friend. Now get your ass up or I will feed it to this thing. - Oh yeah? I'd like to see you try. Ow. (ominous instrumental music) - I don't hear anything. - Shh. (Andy pants and winces) - Which way? - How should I know? Go. (megaconda clatters) (dramatic music) (megaconda screeches) - Holy shit. (gun fires) - Dad! - Hey kid, this is where you earn your money, now give me some cover! (guns fire) (guns fire) (megaconda screeches) - Go sheriff! This is war, I got it, I got it! - Come on, come. Come on! (guns fire) (guns fire) (megaconda screeches) (megaconda screeches) (Hoke screams) (Tina screams) (Tina crunches) (gun fires) - Over here, you bastard! (gun fires) - No, no get back here! Get back here! (megaconda hisses) (gun fires) - Yeah, come and get me! Bring it on! (Andy crunches) - Andy! (sobs) (dramatic music) (gun fires) (megaconda screeches) (gun clicks) - I'm out, I'm out, I'm out! - Wait, hold on, hold on, Hoke's there. (megaconda growls) (detonator beeps) Run, run, run, run, go, go, run, run! Go, go, go! (detonator beeps) (megaconda screeches) - You're gonna make one hell of a pair of boots. (explosion booms) (megaconda screeches) (explosion booms) (explosion booms) (megaconda groans) - [Wendy] Is it dead? - Yeah. It's dead. (midtempo electronic music) - [News Anchor] Eye witnesses have reported yet another explosion on the top of Iverson Point, leading to much speculation and concern among the citizens of this small town. The most recent substance can be seen from as far away as two miles and fears that another limnic eruption of deadly CO two gas has officials justifiably concerned.
