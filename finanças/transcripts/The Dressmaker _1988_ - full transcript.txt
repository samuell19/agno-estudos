[music playing] [sizzling] [cat meowing in fright] [laughing] [whimpering] [knocking] [knocking] [knocking] I've only brought you shirts. There's no need to stop your work, Jack. I've turned your cuffs for you, and I've put patches on the elbows. I don't know how you do it. You must walk on your elbows, you young fellas. Now, now, Nellie. You do look after me. That's what we do in our family, young Jack, and don't you forget it. How's my little girl? Rita's fine. You've done wonders for her, Nellie. What's that? Just a couple of, uh, mutton chops. I'll thank you to take them out of my bag. Brother you may be, but I'm taking no black market favors. Sh! [inaudible] my own rations. I won't eat it. I've always feared God and what's decent. It would coke me to swallow it. Our Margo will have it. She's no religious maniac. Huh. No, she's not. She's just a normal maniac, is Margo. [machinery clanking] [music - "you are my sunshine"] (SINGING ALONG) You make me happy when skies are grey. You'll never know dear how much I love you. Please don't take my sunshine away. Margo, you should be sent to entertain the troops now. You should go into the work house with Margo, you should. Go on! Woo hoo! Oh, sorry. That's all right, love. Oh, it's you. Hello, Rita. How's your Auntie Nellie? Fine. I hope she is, because she's making me a dress. Beautiful thing, it is. It's for the party. We're having a party, you see, Saturday. God, that's tomorrow. I'll be coming around to your house for it tomorrow afternoon. It's a gorgeous piece of material. She's dead clever, your Auntie Nellie. Yeah, she makes things for me. She cuts old things down for me. Mm. How old are you now, Rita? 17. I'm working now, in Dale Street. Are you now? Only after school, you know. Still, you're growing up, eh? Listen, do you want to come to the party, love? My boyfriend, he's called Chuck, he's bringing a few friends over for a sing song. A sing song? Yeah. You can come if you want. I'll ask your Auntie Nellie, ay? A sing song? They often have little get-togethers, Nellie. [inaudible] is a wonderful pianist. He can turn his hand to anything. Including the black market and every swindle, that's going. He's a swine, that's what Jack says. Jack sent you mutton chops. Do you Want to go, then? I don't know. Won't you be shy? I'm not shy. She can't go. How can she? At her age, I wasn't allowed out for a walk, let alone a party. You were different, and look what it's done for you. No. It's not fair. She's got nothing to wear. Well, if that doesn't beat the band. You, a dressmaker, making for half the street. Anyway, her father comes round on Saturdays. But Uncle Jack never talks to me. He just comes around for a snooze. He is her father. Not since her mum died. Still, she should ask him. We look after her now. Please, Auntie Nellie. Well, maybe I could alter something. But I'm not sure the whole thing's wise. Val said I was a big girl now. Well, Valerie knows how to conduct herself. She'll be fine. I'll drop around to see if she's all right. Well, you're not invited. Val won't mind. She'll appreciate the situation. [gasps] Oh! Oh! Oooh! Oh, Nellie! You, hey! Hey! Hey, wait a minute. [chattering] The car is coming. Hey, boy, here we are. Get some action, huh? Oh, no. [chattering] Oh, I love this, Nellie! They'll think I'm the bee's knees in this. It suits you down to the ground. Look at the time! Help! I don't want to take it off, but I haven't got me party underwear on yet. It's from America. You haven't seen anything like it since before the war. Real silk. It's Chinese. Sort of floats onto you. You will let Rita come, won't you, Nellie? Mm, for a bit. Margo wants to come, too. I told her she got a cheek. No, no, she's very welcome. The more the merrier. Open house tonight. Not too open, I trust. You're a magnificent woman, Valerie. Oh, ta, Nellie. You're wonderful. Now, where did I leave my mack? I think I left it in the kitchen. And have you got a bag for us? You've got to suffer to be beautiful, girl. But that dress, Auntie Margo. What about it? It'll be fine. Everybody will know it's just one of yours, cut down. Oh, Nellie's made a wonderful job of it. Will you hold still? I don't know if I want to go. Oh, don't be soft. Of course you want to go. There'll be fellas. Oh? Oh, well, well. Jack, look at your daughter. [newspaper rustling] My word.

I'll give you a dance. Thank you, ma'am. You mustn't be so shy, Rita. Chuck was only being polite. And I'll get you a drink. Uh, excuse me, miss. Did you ever see one of these before? It's a black pudding. Do you eat it? You slice it up and fry it. Here you are, love. Try a whiskey. Ta. Those yanks. What is this do? It's a sing song. Don't be so soft. I never heard no singing. Just noise, our Nellie. I didn't know there'd be yanks. I don't like yanks. The amount they eat, all the flesh on them. Prime steaks. Prime pork chops. Best butter. The money they've got. No wonder our girls throw themselves at them. And there's black ones. We can't even tell with the ones that [inaudible] with their creamy eyeballs, Jeeps roaring up and down. Their military police have to have great dogs on metal chains. Great, ugly brutes with droopy jaws, slathering away. It's a sing song, Jack. She'll come to no harm. Any messing and ooh! [peals of laughter] Come right in, lovely lady! It's your turn to meet Napoleon the Great. [screaming] Sh. [screaming] On the flagship. It's a rough and stormy night. You're about to meet Napoleon, the greatest of British admirals. Don't you mean Nelson? [shrieking] Oh! What is this. Oh, oh, it's you. Oh, how do you do. I'm very pleased to meet you. Feel his head.

We had swamp lands full alligators and snake. And hurricanes smash up your houses. Tornadoes. Ponies. Great big wide open spaces. Do you ride around on ponies? Sure. Sure, we ride around on ponies. [knocking] Come one now. Hurry up. Well, hang on. Oh, darling-- Oh, [inaudible]. Oh, darling, just stand there. OK. Come on. Come. In you go. [vomiting] [singing] Listen. That's my Auntie Margo. (SINGING) Oh, her eyes were brown and her hair all down, lace stockings and that old blue gown. But she dreamed, we're told, of a little world. Poor little Angeline. Then one day her prince came marching and he stood right by her side. Very soon she heard him confiding, I want to make you my bride. What a pretty scene on the village green when [inaudible] Angeline. Now as his princess, she's a great success. Poor little Angeline. [cheering] [applause] [record playing] It's all we have left of her, Jack. Told you. The doodlebugs won't reach Liverpool. Too far. Yeah, one got to Oldham. Branches not a lot of today she'd die of shock some of the things that get talked to you're not going to be hanging onto this stuff forever ordinarily the terrible clutter in here it's all we've got left of the old life jack stand still with us you're not in here All the same, nothing lasts forever. I said no. I'm not going to sell it now. I've guarded it through the blitz, apart from that crack in the middle. And that wasn't my fault. That was the bomb that dropped on the corner of the Priory Road. She used to whip you, Nellie. Did me no harm. And Margo could do no wrong. Ha! And look at her now. She could have done with a few more lashings, could Margo. [record playing] [door opening] Hey! What's going on? - Valerie? - What? Where's our Rita? She's hiding. Oh! Ow! Sorry. Come on. This is Wesley, Auntie Margo. He's an American. Oh. How do you do? Uh, it's an honor to meet you, ma'am. Have you had enough, Auntie Margo? Do you want to go? I think we'd better. Your Auntie Nellie will be sitting up. Well, TTFN, Wes. Huh? Ta ta for now. I go. I come back. OK. Rita? OK. And did Mrs. Evans do Bless This House? Not many of the neighbors were asked. Did you enjoy yourself, love? Yes, thank you. I'm off to bed now. [whispering]. Well, what happened to the sing song? We played games. Hide and seek. Dancing. Hide and seek. Upstairs, in the wardrobes. Oh, Mrs. Mandes saved you some ham and a pickled onion. I wonder where that came from. From the Yanks, from Burtonwood. There was tons of grub. Sounds like [inaudible] to me. Was she all right? [inaudible]. Yeah. She was fine. Bye, Nellie. Jack. [inaudible]. Listen. Hm? That cat's got in with mother's furniture. Negar? Negar, are you in there? You are! Out! Out of there! Jump out of there or I'll kill you. You won't find this sort of quality nowadays. Or ever again, I should say. It's all going to rack and ruin. Cheap and nasty. Deceit and lies. Nothing's ever going back to what it once was, Nellie. Maybe not for the likes of you. Maybe not for you, that's given up the fight for decency. You keep away from Rita. You're not a fit person to safeguard that child. Rita loves me, Nellie. You keep away from Rita. Do you hear me? Leave her be. My Uncle Jack said the docks were built by slaves. You can see the posts with big iron rings where they chained them up. It's a hell of a place. You've got nice white socks. Oh. [honking] It's over there. What is? The sands. Come on. What's wrong? I'm hungry. Not now. When we get to the shore. That's when we eat. It's been empty since the war started. They just went away and left everything. Up here. Come on. Oh, it's gone. There used to be a stuffed hen in the window. It's had a yellow beak. They must've taken it. We have a hen. Always sat on a chair by the fire. Would she give it up? Not even if you dumped water on her. Have you got pets at home, then? No. Got a dog. Say that again. A dog. And a goat. Want me to say that again. And a mare. No pets. We going in this house? In? Might be fun. Might could be a wardrobe in there. It's private. Come on, it's not far. Do you remember me Auntie Margo? She reads rude books. What kind of rude? Men and women. She hides them in a drawer. She was married to a soldier once that got gassed in the trenches. Auntie Nellie nursed him, but he died. That's real tragic. Some lady. She had an understanding with an older fella. Understanding? Going with him. But she lost him. She didn't care enough about him. She didn't fight for him. Them books. Do you ever read 'em? Only bits. She's deep, Auntie Margo. Do you read books like that? I ain't read none of them kind of books. Seen pictures in magazines. Got no call to read them kind of books. Oh. Was this a blitz? [men singing in distance] [singing gets louder] WESLEY: Hey! [whistling] Sh! WESLEY: (SHOUTING) Hey! Hey, fellas! Wa hoo! RITA: Wesley! Don't! Don't! WESLEY: Hey, fellas! Hey! [singing continues] RITA: Leave it! WESLEY: Yeah, buddies. Come on! How you doing? What's biting you, huh? You shouldn't make a show of yourself. Can we eat now? We could go home on the train if you like. Did your Aunt Margo make these? Never. She won't give me the time of day. Bet she wouldn't make no fuss if I whistled. They don't like Yanks, our boys. It's because of the money you earn. We're winning the war for these boys. There are fights up and down Lime Street. Battles, Uncle Jack says. [music playing] What's that? A secret. Piss off! It's rude, doing that. I like kissing, not rude things. I don't get you. What's so rude? It wasn't very awful. We could go back on the train if you like. OK. MARGO: (SINGING) Red sails in the sunset way over the sea. I'll carry my loved one home safely to me. He sailed at the dawning. All day, I've been blue. Red sails in the sunset I'm trusting in you. That'll do, Margo, dear. Well, you've obviously got a first rate voice and a good stance. You could prove invaluable in the chorus. But will you turn up for rehearsals? Oh, yes. Yes. I've got no ties. - Good. Next. Mrs. Nary's house, poor woman. Two double-decker buses lying on top of [inaudible]. Oh. Makeup. Young girls can get away with murder now there's a war on. No shame. No decency. Mr. Bahms, a Minister of Religion, talking to those young trollops. Ooh, my chest. Oh, I must get Margo cigarettes. She won't get through the night without her cigarettes. Oh, dear. Yeah? I've come for my sister's cigarettes. 10 Gold Flake, please. I'm sorry, love. Cigarettes for regular customers only. Yeah, but she is a regular customer. It's just tonight she's late at her works for something. I'm sorry, lovey. I don't know you from Laurel and Hardy. Well, she comes every night. She's thin. She wears a checked coat, and she always has 10 Gold Flake. Love, I've told you. Well, you've no right. She's a regular. Look, love, you can see how I'm placed. (MUTTERING) Stupid young woman. Painted clown. I could just pick up a sweep down and smash it over your head. [shouting] [glass breaking] [shouting] Yeah, you stupid-- come on! [shouting] [glass breaking] Look at you, eh! You fucking sissy. Why don't you use your hands? Come here! Ah, go play in the mud. Use your hands! [screaming] [music playing] Come on, let's get out of here! Wesley! Wesley! Wesley! [dog barking] [tires squealing] [dog barking] I got no fixed kind of job. Just do what comes along. That's what folks do back home. What comes along. Oh. Could you be a businessman, then? I guess if it came along. Can't we go to the movies? It's too late now. You can walk me to the tram. OK. Oh, that was some fighting, though, huh? Wham bam. WOMAN: No! MAN: [groaning] WOMAN: [inaudible]. I could get pregnant. MAN: [groaning] WOMAN: No. Wait. MAN: Oh, you're so beautiful. WOMAN: No, wait. Take it out! I don't want to do this! MAN: Oh, what are you doing? Oh, Jesus. [groaning] I've got to catch my tram. Me Auntie Nellie will wonder what's happened to me. Yeah. Tell her not much. - Same time next week? - Guess so. Keep smiling. Oh, Belle. Oh, Margo. Oh, awful, this queuing. Gets to your legs. It's usually Nellie. Don't often see you out shopping. Oh, Nellie's gone to Birkenhead to buy some material. How's Valerie? Oh, your Nellie will need to be busy again. I think there'll be an engagement outfit to be ordered soon enough. You do? Oh, such a pleasant boy, Chuck. He's very handsome. And now your Rita! - Our Rita? - Yeah. Valerie saw them downtown. What do you think of Him Oh, he's very nice. We hardly know him. But you spoke to him at our house. Oh, yes. What does Chuck think of him? Well, of course, Chuck would hardly mix with him. I mean, he's a mechanic of sorts. He's very polite. His father's got a business in the city. What city? Uh, Washington. It's near the White House. WOMAN: All right, girls. Come on. Oh, we're moving. The White House? He'll be handy for home, then, when he's the president. [radio playing] [door opening] Where's me Auntie Nellie? She's gone to measure up Mrs. Thornby. Will you get them wet things often and dry yourself down. You'll catch your death. I'm going to light a fire. I don't what Nellie says. You'll catch your death. [crying] Oh, what is it, love? Is it this fella? Hm? Is it the Yank you were in the wardrobe with? Oh, god. Fellas. They'll break your heart soon as look at you. What's he done to you, hm? Nothing. I waited two hours. He said same time. It was awful. Drunks, fights, then women. Two hours. Never you fret. He'll come running. He's never said I was beautiful or nice or pretty. Once he said I looked like a drowned rat. You are pretty, love. Pretty as a picture. I'm sure he loves you. I think I pushed him away. When I was on the beach, he touched me here. And I pushed him away, Auntie. Oh, my god. And he wanted me to go in a shop doorway. And I did, but I wouldn't let him do anything to me. That's why he didn't turn up. I know it is. Rita, you're quite right. I mean, you've got to be a decent girl. You've got to have self respect. But if you want to keep him, you've got to give. You shouldn't listen to Nellie. Grown ups say what they're supposed to say. Young girl aren't always supposed to listen. What do you mean? If you're frightened, you'll lose him. I know. Listen to me, giving advice. I lost my husband. Oh, no regrets. I never knew how to give. I was going to marry again, you know. You probably won't remember a thing about it. Mr. Aviard? That's him. Now, Nellie put a stop to that. Oh, the scene I caused. I jumped out of Jack's car when it was going, ran around the streets all night, ended up at the abattoir watching the gallows being unloaded at dawn. Oh, they brought me home. And there you were, sitting in the front window, fast asleep on Nellie's knee. You wouldn't go to bed, Nellie said. Auntie Margo, when I was a little girl, I'd do anything for you. Tell him you forgive him. But then you must give a little. I'm going to let you see a book I've got. Where to, then? It's not right, Jack. I'm allowed me petrol ration. It's not black market. One of these days. Can we go to the cathedral? But I don't want to be like back. I'm going out. Where to? Just out. Cathedral it is, then. Cannot get a word out of her. She's been at Sarah Bernhardt's all week. Well, we have been looking a bit off color. How can I go on holiday? I only offered. I've got your Rita to look after. Well, there's Margo. I wouldn't leave the cat with our Margo. I [inaudible] damn sack more care of her than you do. What about tonight? You have no idea what she's up to. She's going to the pictures with Sissy Banes. That's what she says. Can you be so sure? Sissy Banes. We've never even set eyes on this Sissy Banes. Where does she live? Is she rough? Oh, get away with it. Oh, was is Sissy Banes she was out with last week, when she came back with sand in her shoes? Hm? Was it? Do you know what, miss? I think you're jealous. Just bloomin' jealous. We could go to that boarding house in [inaudible]. If I told you Rita was stealing things-- - Now steady on, Margo. - Eh. Take no notice. Now hang on. What's she mean by it then? That necklace Margo wore to Valerie's, when she was never invited. - Her mum's necklace? The state she came home in that night, it's a wonder she brought her clothes home, never mind a string of pearls. You grudge me going out, you do. You'd like me locked indoors, peddling a sewing machine, my mouth jammed full of pins. You're keeping me down. Keeping you down. Keeping you down. Who does every single thing in that house? Who nursed mother for six years when she laid dying? You stopped me going to [inaudible]. I've never! You rang the fire post behind me back and stopped me fire watching. I could've been married again, and who drove him away? Who put a stop to that? [inaudible] I loved him! You should have stayed true to your own husband's blessed memory. And who nursed him when he came back gassed from the war? You wouldn't let me see him. You shoved him in that room, and you kept him to yourself. What did you do to him? - Margo! No. No. What? How come the others he came back with managed to live, but my husband-- the man I brought into the house. She looked after him so good, and when he damn well died-- Oh, by got, huh, Margo! Jealousy? Jealous-- oh! Nellie? She in bad temper. She's fainted. Shut your gob, Margo. This is serious. Go and get our Rita, quick. Nellie! Margo! Rita. Rit! Quickly. She didn't want the cocoa. The vicar took the tea all right. And the biscuits. God knows what's brought him here. Nellie'll be putting him right. Might as well. What was that Dr. Boyle said? Best not to upset her in future. Not cause scenes. He said she should take it easy, that's what he said. There wasn't much to worry about. And he said about upsetting her, Margo. You might have seen her off. [radio playing] That word. Always chokes me up. What word? Blue. Blue birds. Blue bells. Blue bottles. Well, if you're a man of God, Mr. Barnes, then you certainly should know what's best for all concerned. But I don't think you can be right to refuse to speak to my Rita. Well, dear, again, Rita is not really your daughter now, is she? Perhaps it could be her father's responsibility, this sort of thing. Jack leaves it to us. Jack doesn't now what to say to young girls. No, Mr. Barnes, she could be in spiritual danger. It is your duty. Which, sadly, I must decline. I hardly know the child. And with this war on, everything is in such a turmoil. The war is no excuse. MAN (IN MOVIE): And what a welcome the town gives it's liberators. Inhabitants can't all express their feelings in English, but lips were not only made for talking. The American advance was so swift that the enemy was given no time to stand and fight. Though there is no shadow to darken-- [match lighting] [inaudible] these troops are going to have plenty of practice in the art of kissing happy mademoiselles in the near future. For the benefit of those who have suffered from flying bombs but haven't seen one described, here's a picture of one about to be killed by RAF fighter. Flicka. That's what I'll call her. My colt. Your colt? BOY (IN MOVIE): Yes, sir. That's the one I want. FATHER (IN MOVIE): Rocket's filly, Ken? BOY (IN MOVIE): Yes, sir. FATHER (IN MOVIE): You want a horse that'll be a friend to you, don't you, Ken? BOY (IN MOVIE): Yes, sir. FATHER (IN MOVIE): Well, you'll never make a friend of that filly. Look what she and Rocket did last night to get back together. No place in the world will ever hold them. BOY (IN MOVIE): I'll tame them. Wesley, you need to give. Look. BOY (IN MOVIE): You do understand me, don't you, Flicka? [crying] [crying continues] Don't go! Don't! Wake up, Rita. It's only a rotten old nightmare. Come on, chick. Wake up. Wake up, love. Come on. Come on. That's it. That's it. Wake up. Come on. Wake up. Wake up. That's it. You're all right. You're all right. Come on. That's it. You look after me, Auntie Margo. I tried to do it, but I couldn't stand it. I know. You poor thing. You're too young for those fellas, Rita. You just get upset. I know, but I love him, Auntie Margo. I know. [screaming] You shouldn't be up, Nellie. You'll do for yourself. I'm better now. Come on. Bring her in with us. Come on, Rita. You get back to your bunk. Don't tell me where to go. You watch your step. We'll have to ask him round. It'll be for your own good, love. Half a dozen trotters, Mrs. O'Toole. News is good, eh? Going well in France. Of course, that's, uh, not much consolation to you I suppose. Not much. No. Nellie. You should never be out of your bed. Excuse me, Mrs. O'Toole. Come with me. Tommy, tuppence eight bit change. Come on, Nellie. And skin the rest of them rabbits for me. If only it hadn't been a Yank. Where were they when we needed them, in 1939? At home, making money out of us. The best of them are all over in Europe, dead. A mix of bloods, all races mixed together. Jews, darkies, red Indians, Chinamen, you name it. You've heard these stories about our girls marrying a perfectly white looking one and have a pickaninny. That's it. And Margo knew all about it. Well, ha. Anyway, I've told Rita he better come to tea to meet the family. We want to do what's right. We'll have to meet him. Have a talk with him. Next Sunday afternoon. Oh. Oh, as soon as that? Come in. I-- I slipped on the rabbit. I'm sorry. Oh, sit down, Jack, do. Come on, Tommy, love. We'll run the tap on that. Oh, honestly, Jack, sometimes you make me wonder. How can you call yourself a butcher if you can't stand the sight of blood? Come on, Tommy, love. It's all right, really. There. Hold it up. It's human blood. It's different. There. Now, go and see to those customers. WOMAN: Right, Tommy. Half a pound of [inaudible]. Is that finger all right, then? We'll see this fellow on Sunday, then. The nearer to the [inaudible], the further from danger. [door closing, locking] I managed to get some tins of stuff. I hope he eats our kind of food. And my tomatoes are just turning nicely. Where's your Auntie Margo? Ironing her things. Isn't it exciting? JACK: Oh, yes. The first war was two weeks' training, off to France. Frontline. Living hell. I reckon' so, sir. It's where Margo's husband got gassed. Gassed? Oh, Jack. Never mind all that. No, Nellie. Sorry. Oh, look. I am such a bad girl, being late and not to greet you, Wesley. Oh, please, don't get up. How polite you are. Of course, you probably won't remember me from Valerie's party. I'm Margo. You're Wesley. No, I remember you just fine, Miss Margo. You do? What have I been missing? Oh, sit down, Wesley. Thank you, ma'am. Oh, Jack and Nellie will be curious to know about your background. Your family. I believe your dad's got a business in Washington. I guess so, sir. It's, um, it's real estate, isn't it? That's right, ma'am. Real estate. And have you any brothers and sisters, Wesley? Two brothers, four sisters. Are you Catholics then? No. Nothing special. Well, that's-- that's quite a family. Prodigious. Uh, would you like some tea, Wesley? It's ready on the table. - Well, I'm ready for some home cooking, ma'am. Oh. Eh, well, it's only salad. Oh, but they're our own tomatoes. Not shop. Right. Let's all sit to the table. Eh, Rita, you and Wesley there. Jack-- yeah, all right, Margo. You there. Jack. I'll put the tea on. We hear amazing things about you GIs, Wesley. Well, I ain't sure if they're all true, Miss Margo. Oh, I bet they are. Well, pull yourself together, Margo. What's got into you? It's that lad. I see that. He's no good. Hm? He's a nice enough lad. I know men. That one's no good. Well, Jack likes him. It'll end in tears. And worse. - Can I help you ladies? - Oh, no. No, Wesley. You go and sit with Rita. Yes, ma'am. Oh, how lovely! Diamonds. Oh, look, Rita! Isn't that beautiful? Jack? JACK: Oh, yeah. That's very nice, darling. And Chuck's going to get us an ice box. A what? A refrigerator, for food. To keep it cool. What's food? Who's got any? Chuck says everybody's got an ice box in the states. [muffled conversation] You hiding the matches, our Rita? Oh, chickie, come on. What's up? I'm not going back in there. Don't be silly, girl. I'm not being silly. Well, don't be upset by your Auntie Margo. I want to die. Come outside. Oh, the stories that go around about you Americans at work and what you're supposed to get up to. But you wouldn't believe what some of our lot get up to in the explosives room, behind the main building. It's a regular thing! What you've got to take into account is your Auntie Margo was a married woman. And she's quite a remarkable woman as well. You know what I'm getting at? What's she going on with him for? She's not really, our Rita. You've not done anything with him, have you? Have you? No. I want my mum. Oh, dear. I"m sorry. Mum'll choose. You're only talking to me now because I'm growing up. You haven't noticed me for the last 10 years. Your Auntie Nellie's in charge of you, love. We only want what's best for you. God knows what things are going on. Yanks at the front door. You out the back in tears. We best go inside. No! I want him to look at me. Me! Not Auntie Margo! It's not what it seems. Well, I'll go in. I think you'd best go after her. I should. Uh, out this way? - Yeah. Out the backyard. Sure. Your cat's got fleas. But when will I see you? You were never round last week. When? I guess I can't make next Saturday. Can we go to the country again? I can take time off work. We could go to that place again. I reckon I ain't got no furlough next week. Rita? Rita? I want to tell you things, things about how I feel. OK. I guess I'll call you. Will you? NELLIE: Rita, are you out there? Shouldn't we go back in? I mean, I have to leave in five minutes. OK. Got any gum, chum? [piano playing] (SINGING TOGETHER) We'll gather lilacs in the spring [inaudible]. Bend over. Kneel down. Swoop up the flowers as if they were all you're dreaming of. Don't just waft about. Lilac grows on trees, up in the air. I'd appreciate a bit of discipline in the watches. Now, let's gather these lilacs as if we really desire them. Do we have to sit here every night while she goes on like that with them? She insists. Says we've all got to be here to get that feeling of ensemble. Well, she can ensemble somebody else. I want me tea. [coughing] Oh, you can always tell. No dedication. No sense of purpose. Right, think of victory and sing. [piano playing] (SINGING TOGETHER) We'll gather lilacs in the spring [inaudible]. Well, it's got to change, young lady. Your [inaudible] with your moping around. All I want you to do is go out and get [? me ?] some stamps from the post office, and you look as if you were struck. Now, what is it? Nothing, Mr. Bates. Well, perk up, or nothing's what you'll be doing. Now, 40 tuppence 8 bits, and try to look cheery. Rita? It's for you. It's a Yank. Hello? No. I'm glad you rang. I did wait for you, two weekends now. What happened? Oh. I see. Well, what about Saturday then? OK. Auntie Margo? She's fine. Well, actually, she's at home off work today with a headache. I've got to go. Will I see you Saturday? Same time, same place? Oh, all right. But you will ring again? That's all that matters. Try. Ma'am? Wesley! Rita's out. Yeah. I know. Oh. Well, you best come in. Sit down, Wesley. Whatever brings you here, then? Oh! Oh, thank you. Did you want a word with Rita? Look, Wesley. I mean, um, what is it you've come for? I've got to speak to you, ma'am. I can't see Rita no more. Well, you better tell her. I tried. She don't listen to me. Can you-- Me? Well, she'll listen to you, ma'am. You're a woman of the world. You know about grief. You know about men. Do I? Your husband dying and them kind of books you read. You know what's wrong between us. She can't seemed to enjoy things, you know? Relax? She's kind of joyless. What books? About men and women. Oh. It's Nellie. I'm afraid we've never really taught the girl how to enjoy things. You're from a different world. There's some things everyone enjoys. I think I'd better go to my work, Wesley. You talk to Rita. I'll call again, ma'am. Oh, Mother, you can't smack me anymore. No more smacks. There. Fit for a queen you look, love. Just an engagement party will do, Auntie Nellie. Oh, it's lovely material. Do you like it, Rita? You know, I think green would suit you as well, oddly enough. I wouldn't suit green. I think that shoulder sits a bit better now. It's perfect, Auntie Nellie. It's perfection. And what about the waist? Do you think it needs something? Hm? You think? Yeah. Wait a minute. I've got the exact right thing for that waist. Take your time, Auntie Nellie. We've still got a week to the big day. You are going to come, aren't you? You won't let me down? I couldn't miss your engagement, could I? Val? Val? What? Val, I've written another letter to Wesley. Will you ask your Chuck to give it him? I'm sorry. I thought you said he wrote. Well, he did. But that was ages ago. He said he might have to go on a course. A course? Don't send him a letter, love. Why not? [inaudible]. No. No. All right. Put it in be bag. Go on. Well, don't tell. All right, love. It's a lovely dress. Oh, Rita, why don't you just forget about him? I can't. I can't. I know, but-- but try, ay? I know it's a lot to ask you of Chuck. Look, it's not that, love. Listen, Chuck told me what was in that last letter, and Wesley's just not interested. Told you? He knew. He had to read it out to Wesley. What do you mean? Well, Wesley can't read, lovely. [door opening] Rita, love. You go to bed. I can't sleep. Is it that fella? Oh, hell. Listen, Rita. I've got to tell you something. I'm sorry, but I've never had a minute with you on your own before. Now, be brave. Your Wesley was around here, that day I was off sick. Ay? He wanted me to break it to you gently. What? What do you mean? Well, he wants to do what's best. He feels you're too young. He's a nice lad. No! Oh, don't take it to heart. He's going to ring me. No. He's not. Why did he tell you? I don't believe you. He wanted to do what's best. [music playing] She's a picture, isn't she? Radiant. Yeah. But I just wish some of these people knew how to behave. This is like a nightmare. - Drink up, Nellie. - No. No more. Not for me. Cheer up, Rita. Now, you'll have a whiskey. I remember, don't I, from the last little party. You ended up in the wardrobe, I hear. Not tonight, thank you, Mrs. Manders. Oh, dear. My big mouth. It's that boy, isn't it? You know, Chuck says he hasn't seen sight nor sign of him for weeks. They think he's done a bunk, run off. He seemed a bit unusual. Where's your Margo tonight? It's not like her to miss a do. Oh, she'll be coming. A bit later, she said. She's got one of her headaches. Oh, dear. Poor Margo. But she just keeps sparky, doesn't she? [music playing] Oh, cheer up, Rita. You're supposed to be happy for Val. Well, I'm not. Well, don't let me spoil your fun, love, but I've got to get home. I've got to. Can't I come with you? No. No. You just behave yourself till Margo gets here. And be back by 11. Now, then, Nellie, you'll have some of this Yankee ham, surely to goodness? Mr. [inaudible], will you give me a heave up? I'm not too great. Well, what shall I toss you? No, don't go making me nervous. Now leave me now, Sybil. I'm fine. And don't go telling Val. She'll only get upset, and it's her big night. Of course. I'll see myself to bed. Are you sure you'll be all right? No, no, no. Off you go. All right. Well, [inaudible] love. God bless. - Good night. Margo? Margo? Margo? MARGO: [muffled noises] [door opening] MARGO: [whimpers] [grunts] Jesus! [glass breaking] He fell. I couldn't help-- Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! What are we going to do? We ought to tell someone. We ought to tell someone. Hold thy tongue. But it's wicked. And what about Rita? I haven't got much of a life. Get young Jack. Tell him to get the van and bring it round the back. Tell him there's been an accident. I'll stitch him into this so Jack won't have to see the blood. Go on. Don't stand there all night. Rita could come in any minute. We don't want her wandering in, do we? But it's wicked. Whatever was he doing with that necklace? He said she buried it, so he dug it up. Get Jack. Go on. Phone. Have you got two pennies? Go on, phone. [spitting] What'll they think, if anyone sees? They'll think it's a side of beef. Just get it down to the [inaudible] dock and slide it in. God, no. We could all hang for this. It was an accident, Jack. I was only doing what was best for the family. God, Nellie. You're a good boy, Jack. You can do it. I know you can. There's no blood involved. Yeah, but-- Margo will help. [crying] [door closing] [crying continues] What is it, love? Hm? He's run away. He'll come back. You're having a fret. Come sit yourself down and get warm. You're freezing. What's that doing in the fire? Hm? Oh. Oh, that was your dad. Clumsy fella. Was my dad here? Oh, he just popped in. Now, sit down. Auntie Margo, I wish I was dead! Don't cry. Oh, Rita, please, don't cry. Don't cry. She's in a terrible state, Nellie. She'll get over it. It's time we were in bed. [cat screeching] Just look at him. He can't stand that. You do look after me, you two. You better come in with us tonight, love. Grab hold, Margo. [whimpering] [music playing]
