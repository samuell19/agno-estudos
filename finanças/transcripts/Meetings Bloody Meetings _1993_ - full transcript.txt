I've got to go to a meeting. It's a phrase that makes most people's heart sink. It echoes with boredom, frustration, and a general waste of valuable time. And yet, we all know you can't manage without meetings. A team isn't a team unless we all get together to worry away at problems and come to decisions. The answer, of course, is to have efficient, effective, and productive meetings. But we all know that's easier said than done. A recent survey of 1,000 executives and managers from top American companies revealed that they felt that 1/3 of the time they spent at meetings was wasted. And it's even more serious than it sounds, because the more senior you get, the more meetings you go to-- 17 hours of them a week for the top executives in the survey. And 80% of the 1,000 also felt that running meetings was a crucial test of a manager's ability. Meetings are management. They're at the heart of any quality program. And any quality organization, for that matter. Good meetings set everyone off with a sense of purpose and a feeling they've got somewhere. Bad meetings leave them demotivated, irritated, and alienated. If you think about it, a meeting is often the only time the whole management team comes together. It's the only place where the leader is seen as a leader, rather than the official individuals report to. If they feel their time has been wasted, they lose respect not just for the leader, but also for the wider organization that put that leader in place. And now for the really depressing finding. People who run meetings badly don't improve with experience. Even worse, people who attend their meetings pick up their bad habits. Many of them genuinely don't realize they're making a mess of it. They aren't even aware that running meetings is a teachable, learnable skill. But of course, it's not a gift. It's a technique. In fact, a technique with five key elements. These five elements supply the framework of the Video Arts Training Video, Meetings, Bloody Meetings. It's the most popular video we've ever made, and probably the most widely used training video of all time. And that means that quite a lot of people do realize that running meetings is the central management skill, and that it has to be learned. And the fact that you're about to watch it suggests that you share that realization. So I hope you enjoy it. John Cleese and Robert Hardy in Meetings, Bloody Meetings. What time do you want the clock for, dear? Oh, quarter to six, please, darling. Quarter to six? Mm, I've got a pre-breakfast meeting. Pre-breakfast meeting? - Tim? - Hmm? Why can't you do your work while you're at work? There isn't time. I have to go to meetings, apologizing for being late because I've been kept at the previous meeting, and leaving early while making arrangements to meet again in order to finish the meeting, so that I can get to the next meeting. This goes on until leave work when I can, at long last, start work. Done nearly four hours tonight. Do you think it would make things easier if I came and slept at the office? Why don't you come and sleep at the meeting? Everyone else does. In fact, if it wasn't for the rest we got at meetings, we'd never be able to work this late. This isn't work, is it? Hm? You are hereby summoned to appear in that you did exceed the speed limit. Well, I was late for the meeting at the factory because the meeting at the office went on and on and on. Insulting behavior? Well, I didn't realize that the motorcyclist cutting in and waiving was a policeman. You waved back? In a way, in a way. Oh, Thursday afternoon. You won't be late for the Thomas's, will you? No, no, no. It won't take long. It's a court case. It's not a meeting. They're all the same, really, aren't they? What? A lot of people in a room, trying to establish what happened and why, and deciding what to do about it. Nothing like each other at all. At court, you have rules, procedures. It's all organized. Meeting, you just meet. Timothy James Brown Smith, you're charged with chairing without due thought and preparation, failing to signal your intentions to the meeting, negligent ordering of the agenda, not being in full control of your discussion, and failing to record decisions of the meeting. How do you plead? I, I think I'm supposed to be in a meeting. - But this is a dream. - Yes. Well, you can't have a meeting now, you're in bed, asleep. But supposing I got a meeting in this dream? It won't matter if you don't turn up, will it? Anyway, these are very serious charges. If proven, they amount to cold blooded time-wasting and conspiracy to obstruct the course of good decision making. Why pick on me? My meetings are no worse than anyone else's. You don't establish your own innocence by proving the guilt of others. First charge, chairing without due thought and preparation. You haven't got any evidence. Will you kindly cast your mind back to six minutes past 10 on the morning of April the 7th this year? Your weekly production meeting? Oh, Christ. What's keeping him? Sorry I'm late. The meeting for bloody planning went on and on, as usual. Wasting time. Well, nice to see you all again. Tim, how long is it going to take this morning, then? Well, it depends what we've got to discuss, really. Do you mind taking the things you need me for first? I should be on the floor. Yes, I should think so. Well, nice to see you all again, as I said. Gosh, is it really a week since we met? It seems like yesterday. It was yesterday. What? Well, we had to make a decision about the quality program. Oh. What a fool. So you did. Well, Howard? - Sorry, have we started? - Yes. Right. Well, nice to see you all again, as I say. What are we talking about this morning? Well, we better talk about that first. [INAUDIBLE] agenda, item one, the agenda. Now Ian has got to go pretty sharpish, as I say. Look, what have you got? I'd like to talk about the night shift stand by. Ah, yes. And I had a word with Frank about that, and he thinks that two will be enough until we get ahold of the new B265s. - What about the weekend? - Well, see what you think about this. Yes, this is nice. Not sure about the allocation there, but he will let me know next week. So, what else we got? Well, I always think it's very useful to get together like this. You know, just to see if-- Is there any point in having got together? - What? - It's good. Great. Thanks. Oh, Tim. I saw Hawkins on Friday. Oh, that was it. What did he say? Well, he thinks we'll probably be all right until the last quarter. But he did point out that that new cooling system has got problems. Well, I've taken care of that, you see. There wasn't any problem in the cooling system. They were using the wrong coolant. Haven't read the instruction manual, as usual. So they were using the type grade A, but this new one takes double X. So the whole system-- replaced the bearings, and there's no damage, and everybody seems to know about the double X now. So we shouldn't have any more trouble there. Good. Right. Well, what else does anyone want to talk about? Nothing for me. - Nope. - No. - No. [BEEPING] Good. Right. Well, there wasn't anything anyone wanted to talk about. - Including yourself? - Yes. Well then, why have the meeting? It's the weekly meeting. You mean, it's like climbing Everest? You do it because it's there. Look, normally there's plenty to talk about, OK? - Well, there wasn't that time. - No. - Why didn't you cancel it? - Cancel it? Well, I mean, I don't know what they want to talk about until they get there, do I? Not if you don't find out beforehand, no. Not if you chair without due thought and preparation, no. I mean, really. Suppose I conducted my court like that? Prisoner at the bar, you stand charged with, he doesn't appear to be charged with anything, My Lord. Who made out this indictment? - I did, My Lord. - But it's blank. Well, I thought that would give everyone a chance to contribute. You know, let the feeling of the meeting-- ah, the court emerge. You know, play it by ear. I think you'd better tell us what the charge is. Well, I haven't given it that much thought, quite honestly, My Lord. Things have been a bit hectic down the station this week. I thought we could sort of work something out when we all got together. You see, you're a menace. Abso-bloody-lutely hopeless. You're not supposed to talk to me like that. Don't blame me. It's your dream. Disgraceful, a total waste of everybody's time. Well, not a total waste. I mean, we sorted out that stuff about Hawkin and the cooling system. And Daisy was able to clear up the standby thing with Jackie. We got something done. But those things could have been done over the telephone or in each other's offices. You didn't need a meeting for them. I mean, to ask you the question that you should have asked yourself, what was the meeting intended to achieve? Well, it was the weekly meet-- And what would have been the consequence of your not holding it? So, conducting a meeting means, stage one, preparing yourself so that you are absolutely clear what the meeting is for. And then stage two, making sure that everybody else is quite clear as well. Yes, I know what you mean. Yes, you're talking about an agenda. Yes, well I do those sometimes. Like a fortnight ago? Yes, I was coming to that. Second charge, failure to signal your intentions to the meeting. The morning of June the 12th, 10:00 AM, precisely. Right, everybody have an agenda? Good. Now, item one, improving company communications. I think we all understand the problem. Ron? It's a problem, all right. And it'll cost a lot of money to solve it. - Yes, you mean staff costs. - No, not staff, equipment. Surely it's management time at the root of it? No, equipment. At least six more BDUs. What? Well look, if you want Sales and Accounts to have direct access to data, then you must-- I'm sorry, Ron. I mean, look, we may be able to deal with this later on if we've got time. But can we take item one now? I am taking item one now, improving company communications. No, no, no, Ron. It's not the computer, it's the telephones. What? Look, every time we try to get through down there, they're engaged. - What? - No, it isn't. - What? Well, I'm talking about how we explain this year's company results to the team leaders. What? The company results? I thought you wanted a new switchboard. I mean, you know the hold ups we've been having down there. Look, I'm talking about company communications. So am I. So am I. I mean, how can we communicate if the phones are always busy? Look, the whole point of this is to get ideas on how to explain this year's company results to the team leaders. Well, why didn't you say so? Well, hasn't anyone done any thinking on it? - I spent two hours yesterday. - Ah. Designing a new layout on the DTP for the newsletter. That was your first misdemeanor, and then hardly 20 minutes later-- I know, I know. So item six, expenditure on maintenance on the B11265s and the B219s. - Ron? - Well, I've been through all this. And I can't see where we can cut back. I agree. I feel very strongly that we'd be taking quite unacceptable risks. - What? - Look, Tim. The 126s are over four years old. Now they need checking-- Hang on. Hang on. I'm sorry. I think we should be spending more on maintenance. - So do I. - So do I. What? I was talking about this a few weeks ago. - When? - Spend more money? Well, now that we've postponed the equipment program. - Oh. - Right. - What extra maintenance will they need? - What will it cost? Well, I can't tell you off the top of my head. Look, the point of putting this on the-- Well then, let's think. Well, we better take this on Friday, too. Means I'll have to come in. Damn. Ian, will you please have some figures then? Last item. - [INAUDIBLE], 10 to 15,000? - 10% to 15%. Oh, thanks for telling me. Now, number seven, the Sterling contract. Jackie, how many machine hours? Well, Fred's kept me waiting for these because he's got a problem with machine allocation. - He's not sure if we're going to-- - You mean you haven't got them? Well, I have them tomorrow evening, latest. I need a decision on this today. - Today? - Yes, look. It says Sterling Contract, estimates and terms. I mean, isn't that clear? I thought we were just reviewing it. Anyway, we can't decide anything without George, can we? Why not? Well, he's got to agree the delivery dates. That affects the pricing. Well, we better take this Friday, too. We should have just come Friday. Friday, there goes Friday. Well, at least we can decide on some of the figures, can we? - Yes, why not? - Get something done. - Will George be here on Friday? - Yes, yes, he will be, yes. Well, we can decide the materials budget. Yes, we can. Yes, what were the corresponding figures on the Ashcroft deal? Have you got them? You know, I think it's probably better if we take it all in one go on Friday. Yeah? I'm going to keep mine. I'm going to frame it. Well, at least I had an agenda. - No, you did not. - What? Here, this is just headings jotted down to remind you of the topics. An agenda's not just a chairman's crib card, you know. It's a brief for all the others to work from. It's got to define the direction and the area of the discussion, and its end purpose. I mean, imagine that sort of thing in my court. Call the first witness, James Dugdale. - You are James Dugdale? - I am. Uh, My Lord, this is James Dugdale. James Dugdale, My Lord. My Lord, James Dugdale. Well? Well, that's all it says, My Lord, first witness, James Dugdale. Who or what is Mr. Dugdale? - I am an expert. - He is an expert, My Lord. Precisely what kind of an expert? I'm an expert on Renaissance art. - On Renaissance art, My Lord. - Why have you called him? Well, he is an expert, after all, My Lord, on Renaissance art. [INAUDIBLE] He's here to testify about the painting. It's a fake. The painting is a fake. - Oh? - Did he sell it? Definitely not, My Lord. Right. We know exactly what Mr. Dugdale is, why he's here, and what we expect to get out of him. Now then, where is the painting? Well, where is the defendant? How about this Friday? [INAUDIBLE]? Anybody not do this Friday? So, make it clear to everybody what is being discussed, why it's being discussed, and what you hope to achieve from the discussion. And anticipate the people and the information that you need, and make sure you've got it. Well, look, I do all those things sometimes. If you could you use that excuse again, I shall have you hanged, twice. - Twice? - Don't argue. And anyway, even when you do get all those things right, you still make mistakes with your agenda. Like what? Third charge, negligent ordering of agenda and criminal misallocation of time. What do you mean? Perhaps this will refresh your memory. September the 20th, last year, 3:25 in the afternoon. Right. That's item one decided. Allocation of parking spaces at the new park. Six spaces for marketing and PR, four each for production management and factory management, and eight for administration. For review after three months? Yes, yes, right. Now, take 45 minutes? Right. Item two, for decision, McKenna Brothers. Order for 250 L3s for delivery, 31st October. Do we accept the order, or is October the 31st too tight? - The L3s are practically obsolete. - Marcus, they're not obsolete. Well, we oughtn't to be selling them. The L5s are more durable. They're easier to handle. Look, I want to take this order if we can. OK? It's McKenna, so if we can do this one, they may come back to us. Rod? Well, I think we're making a mistake. Look, I'm sorry. It's 10 to now, all right? Yes, well, if we hadn't wasted 45 minutes discussing the bloody parking. That was urgent. The park opens on Monday. Rod, how can we do this McKenna job? Well, we'll have to do the L3s on number two and three machines, tomorrow and Thursday. Oh, well now, just a moment. Ian, one thing at a time, please. So that will mean completing the Ashcroft B19 over the weekend. - The weekend, right. - Will that give you a problem? No, no, no. That's fine. OK, that's it. Now item number three, for information. Forward maintenance schedule. What's this about, Ian? - Oh, it's nice to get a word then. - Do you want to chair the meeting? No, not now. I just want to remind you that we'll have two machines down every night this week. - Oh, bloody hell. - Gave you the schedules last week. Well, can't it wait until next weekend? If you don't mind the place going up in smoke. - Well, what about the McKenna L3 order? - YP. - What? - Your problem. Why didn't you mention this while we were discussing it. I've been trying to. - What can we do, Ron? - Well-- Not take the order. We'll have to put number 4 onto the McKenna order. That will mean working this weekend on the B19. We may have to ask Ashcroft for a few hours grace on Monday. Right. OK. All right, that's the plan then. New pay scales, next. Team leaders pay. Ron, could you get Ann, please? Now then, 2, 3, and 4 on the L3s. I'll call Ashcroft-- Why don't we offer McKenna the L5s? Because they don't want them. Ah, item four, team leader's pay. Ann, sorry to keep you waiting. Well, we're going to need some more of those miracles of yours this weekend. So before we deal with the pay problem, can you cope with weekend working? Well, no. Not really. - With some difficulty, I'd say. - What? Are you telling me you've forgotten? Remind me. Well, I'm not sure those team leaders will agree to working weekends. We've just take their overtime off them, and at the moment, they're not very happy about anything, let alone working Saturdays. Of course, if the new pay scale's-- - Right, right. OK. Well, we'll talk about team leaders pay first. Then if we get that sorted out, we can deal with working this weekend, now that we know about the overhaul schedule. And then we can go right back to item 2 and see-- Whether to take the McKenna order, or not. Well, I know what you're going to say, but the parking spaces have got to be done. Very well, put it first because it's urgent. But polish it off in five minutes because it's unimportant. You can even put five minutes against it on the agenda. Culpable failure of time planning, but the failure of order planning was even worse. Well, how was I to know about the shift work argument? How was I supposed to know about the maintenance problem? How were you supposed to have decided whether to accept an order before establishing that you had the staff and the equipment to fulfill it? I mean, imagine the clerk of the court planning the sequence of events like that. This is indeed a very straightforward case, My Lord. So I'll now ask the clerk of the court to read the depositions taken from the witnesses at the magistrate's court. If it please My Lord, I, Edward Lynn, newsagent, 44 the High Street, Croyden, do declare that I saw the red van driving away from the scene of the accident. The driver seemed rather-- What accident? Ah. Always been a good son to me. No. Ah, this is it, My Lord. I, George Percy Thomas of 16 the [INAUDIBLE], do declare that I saw the second collision clearly, as I had turned around immediately after-- oh. What is that? The weather conditions during the month of May, during which the accident occurred, My Lord. Fascinating. Fascinating. Who saw the first accident? Ah. This man, My Lord. Harry sang out of the sideboard. - What? - No, no. A lorry swung out of the side road. Sorry, My Lord. We didn't have time to get this one typed. - Why didn't you? - Ohh, this took ages, My Lord, ages. Look for logical connections between different items and arrange them in the necessary order. Allocate time so that the most important items get the fullest discussion, even if they're not urgent. Well, that's the agenda. - Can I wake up now? - Certainly not. Your worst crimes are still to come. I'm supposed to be getting some rest. Fourth charge, not being in full control of your discussion. When? Well, let's just take last Monday, shall we? So you'll deal with that? - OK. - OK. Now item four, discipline. I don't think there are too many problems, but I've got to review the discipline procedure [INAUDIBLE] this week. So, what does anyone think? Well, they're still nicking knives and forks from the canteen. - I thought that had stopped. - Oh yeah, it stopped. For about 10 minutes. - Well, you expect a bit of that. - How much of it is going on? - Well, enough. My problem is that people are still getting sick on Friday and Mondays. Now what your lads need, Ron, is a bit of discipline. It depends on what you mean by discipline. I'll tell you what I mean by discipline, nailing a few of them to the front gates. That's what I'm-- - Oh, shut up, Marcus. What I'm getting at is there won't be any solutions to the sort of things we're talking about until we get people more committed. But how? Because if we want solutions, we should start with working relationships, team work. - What's stopping it? - Well, here's one problem. I mean, we change all our foremen into some new being called a team leader. We take away their overtime, and then ask them to work all weekend. I mean, what kind of world are we living in? I'll tell you what the bloody problem is, we still can't control them. Mine are all right. I scratch their backs, they scratch mine. I see. So is it the training? No, no. It's much more a question of working more closely with them. We should consult them more. Involve them. Are you mad? This is a business, not a school debating society. Though sometimes, I must admit, I think that's what it is. They're not interested, Daisy. I'm mean, my lot are OK, but they won't even read a safety notice until you're up their nose in one. I'll tell you what the problem is. They're all bone, bloody idle. We ought to sack a few of them. - Yes, and get another Jones case. - Oh yes, amazing, wasn't it. I mean, everybody knew what he was up to. Would you call that a discussion? - Well, we were sort of-- - That wasn't a discussion. It was group therapy. A discussion's got structure, just as we have in this court. First, you state the proposition. Next, you produce the evidence. Then you have the arguments about what the evidence proves. Then you come to a conclusion, a verdict. And then, only then, can you decide on the action, the census. Otherwise-- I now declare the case open, and hereby sentence the accused to three months. So now we'll have some evidence, but only a bit. And then I shall ask you, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, to reach your verdict. Then we'll hear what counsel for the defense has to say. But I shall interrupt, demand some more evidence, change my sentence, and then sum up. Then after coffee, we'll have a bit more evidence, and then we'll see if the verdict is still right. Then we'll give the prosecution a run, and after that, we'll have a great big raffle and the winner can read the charge. Structure the discussion in stages so that all the evidence comes before the interpretation of the evidence, and all the interpretation before deciding on the action. Keep the stages separate. That will stop people jumping on and going back over old ground. Yes, well I do that bit sometimes. What about last Wednesday? It was all right at the start. It's not just inflation, because universal international costs haven't gone up as much as ours. I think we should change our suppliers. Hang on a moment. We're still trying to establish reasons. How do we know that our suppliers are costing us too much? Well, pretty sure. No, no, no. They supply UI as well, Ian. You see? So that can't be the reason, right? So we're still trying to get at the reasons behind our cost problem. Howard, one meeting at a time, please. Now we're still trying to get at the reasons behind our cost problem. Daisy? You see? I did that OK, didn't I? Yes, full marks. But you lost them all two minutes later. What do you mean? Fifth charge, failure to summarize and record the discussion. OK. Last item. Ian, can you bring us up to date on progress on the team leaders pay review? Well, I can't take it any further, really. Not until the review committee meets and decides about the regrading proposals, now. When are they going to meet then, Daisy? Well, George was going to arrange that, wasn't he? Because he wanted to be there to put his case. I thought you were going to fix the meeting. - Ron usually does that. - Usually, yes. But as George wanted to be in on, we said we'd leave it to him. That's why I thought George would know. But George isn't here. Well, he must have been here, then. - I thought it was you, Ron. - George. Shall we take a vote on it? Surely we decided that Ian would coordinate with George and Ron. We decided to take the necessary action. Which meant that Ron would make sure the committee consulted George. Not in this case. It was George's job. - Next item. - What? To discuss and decide exactly what it was that we did discuss and decide at the last meeting. - Well, before we decide that-- - Yes? Oughtn't George to be here? Well, I thought everybody knew what had been decided. Supposing we did that? You've been found guilty, but before I pass sentence, I must ask the court if you have any previous convictions? Well, I'm not absolutely sure. But I've got a hunch we did him about five years ago for forgery. Or it could have been arson. But he thinks he was taller. - No, it wasn't arson. - It was him. I'd swear by that. And it was forgery. And I reckon he got off. - No, never. Didn't anyone write down what the judge said? - No, My Lord. No. - Why not? Well, we all thought we knew what had been decided. Ohh. So finally, summarize and record. Do you think you've got it now? I think so. Is it safe to let you wake up? I do have the public to think of, you know. I'll tell you what. If you can summarize this dream, I might be lenient. Thank you, My Lord. Right. Ladies and gentleman, let us record our five stage plan for shorter and more productive meetings. Stage 1, plan. Be clear about the precise objectives of the meeting. Be clear why you need the meeting. And list the topics. Stage 2, inform. Make sure everyone knows exactly what is being discussed, why, and what you want from the discussion. Anticipate what people and information may be needed, and make sure they're there. Stage 3, prepare. Prepare the logical sequence of items. Prepare the time allocation to each item on the basis of its importance, not its urgency. Stage 4, structure and control. Take the evidence stage before the interpretation stage, and that before the action stage. And stop people jumping ahead or going back over old ground. Stage 5, summarize all decisions and record them straight away with the name of the person responsible for any action. May I wake up now? How do you feel, guilty or not guilty? Oh, guilty. In that case, you may wake up. However, if you have not learned your lesson, if you continue to waste other people's time, you will find yourself doing some of your own. [ALARM CLOCK] Mmm. Ugh. Bloody meeting. - Anything wrong? - Nothing dear. No. I think I'll just do a little thinking about that meeting I've got this morning. Huh.
