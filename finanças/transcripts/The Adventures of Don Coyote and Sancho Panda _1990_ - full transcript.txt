[male narrator] Make way for Don Coyote! That's him. He can spot good or evil like nobody can. [theme music] [growling] And nobody can fix it quite like...Don Coyote. Of course, every hero should have a buddy like Sancho Panda to follow in his hoof prints.. ...uh, wherever they may lead. [growling] [air hissing] whoosh trot trot thud There they go, a knight and his faithful squire off protecting, defending, rescuing. There has never been another hero quite like him, luckily. I-I mean, luckily for us like Don Coyote! [instrumental music] [horses galloping] Look, Sancho, an assemblage of local dignitaries out to welcome us to their humble hamlet. Don Coyote's seeing things again. Oh, well, here goes nothing, I hope. Thanks for everything, count. This is everything, isn't it? Yes! Everything I own. The steeplechase was never my strong suit. screech [dramatic music] swoosh thud I, Don Coyote accept the keys to your city with undying affliction. Uh, uh, infection. Uh, that, that is to say, thanks, fellas. I must thank you, sir. I owe you my life and my fortune. See, Don Coyote? These guys are robbers. Brigands! Till my dying day I shall never forget you. [coughing] Such uncommon bravery will not go unrewarded. [coughing] Sounds like he gave you the shirt off his back, Don Coyote. [Don] 'I fear, Sancho, the poor chap has given up enough already.' [dramatic music] That's it, you knock-knee'd dirt pecker. Five more paces and you're finally mine. Three, two.. One, fire! swoosh Humberto, have you seen my.. clang Stow it. Oh, sorry, my rose petal. I wanted to surprise you by catching a chicken dinner to celebrate. You couldn't catch a cold, you moron. And what are we going to celebrate? The count hasn't gone yet. [bell chiming] Ha-ha. He has now. We're rich. He will leave it all to me, won't he? Who else? You've been his loving and faithful servant for 30 years. Haven't you? [clears throat] "And so I, Count Del Poyo "do bequeath my entire estate "to the one man whom I can trust completely. "The one man who helped me in my time of greatest need "who is a noble of soul, stout of heart "iron of will.. "I refer, of course, to that champion of the downtrodden "Don Coyote! boing "Or in the event of Don Coyote's demise my fortune goes to my faithful, uh.." Faithful is scratched out. "Servant, Humberto, and his.. [clearing throat] ...um, wife." [gasping] Don't worry, what you did to that portrait we'll do to that Don Coyote. [birds chirping] Just a minute. Isn't a condemned man granted a final request? You got it, Don Coyote. - If you can catch us. - Which you can't. [all laughing] He can't catch us. whoosh What the heck's goin' on in there? [Rosinante] It's either blind man's bluff or he's blind drunk. In an orphanage, you better be right the first time. Come out, come out, wherever you are. [clattering] [laughing] [clanking] [screaming] [creaking] crash Damn! Look at what he's done now. Yeah! Saved them the price of a wreckin' crew. You little rascals, running outdoors won't help. Come out you little, ramaguffins. I mean, uh, megaruffins. I mean, ragamamas. And thus, the modern Olympics were born. I think you're reachin', Rosie. We're barely out of the middle ages. whoosh swoosh Uh, I don't think I'll ever find this Don Coyote. Where in the heavens will I look? Make way for Don Coyote! [groans] thud Did you say Don Coyote? - Don Coyote? - Did he say Don Coyote? Yes! Are you, Don Coyote too? What a coinci-donkey. Uh, I mean, coinci-dinkey. I mean, how-how about that? So am I. Then, according to the late count's will the new lord and master of Castle Del Poyo is, ahem, Don Coyote. Did you say.. - Don Coyote? - Don Coyote? - There it is, Don Coyote. - Oh, yes. Castle Del Coyote! It has a nice ring to it. Perhaps, it's time to settle down and write my memoirs in an atmosphere of peace and quiet. [Humberto] Uh-oh, this must be him, my tender cactus needle. Good! The sooner we get rid of him the sooner Castle Del Poyo will be ours. - There's one small problem. - What do you mean? - He has a sidekick. - 'So?' We'll just have to dig two graves instead of one. [laughing] I get it. [laughing] Here they are, my little rose petal. Take a good look. They'll never get past the front door. Welcome, Don Coyote! We've been so looking forward to ending your survival. Uh, he means, we've been awaiting your arrival! Most accommodocious of you, madam. Start cranking! creak creak Wait! Is that a daffodil I spy? Perfect! This blossom will be a token of my esteem for the lady of the house. [rattling] [creaking] If they're the caretakers then I think we better take care. My Lord, there are 379 hand-carved steps on this staircase. And you're about to feel every one of them on your head. [screaming] [crashing] Excellent, Desiree! I see you've repaired the main gate. Humberto! [Humberto] 'Coming, my crushed chrysanthemum.' Thank you, my famished friend. I think even I, Don Coyote could come to appreciate the leisure of a life of pleasure. I'm not sure what he meant. But what worries me is that I think I agree. [rattling] No mistakes this time, Humberto. We want to make sure the chandelier falls right on Don Coyote's head. Yes, my virtuous venous fly trap. Okay! Drop it! Uh-oh! It looks like the plot is thickening. [screeching] I think you mean the plot is sickening. Sancho, never has such fortunate fortune fallen on such fortunate fellows. Look out, Don Coyote! I am, Sancho! Looking out at the world and thinking how lucky I am. Uh, Desiree, my dandelion. Help! The, the, the cha-cha-cha.. Speak up, Sancho. You're cha-cha-cha-ing in my ear. What is it? Let go of me, you imbecile. I think I've been with Don Coyote too long. Now I'm seeing things. [both screaming] [groans] [Humberto] I'm so glad we're having this.. [groans] ...quality time together, my.. [groans] ...fragile fern. thud boom crash My goodness! A secret chamber. And I didn't even know it was here! [gasps] Yeah! And here's something else you didn't know was here! [instrumental music] It's the Buckingham Chalice. But it was lost hundreds of years ago. Well, now it's found. And we're the ones who are gonna make ourselves scarce. We're rich! Stop, thief! Who dares invade the sanctuary of Elgordo Guardian of the Buckingham Chalice. - Ghost! Ghost! - Ghost! Ghost! - Ghost! Ghost! - Ghost! Ghost! For three centuries, the chalice has been safe but no more. I sense a serious threat here. And now, I must do battle to keep the chalice from the clutches of the enemy and me, from the Flames of Hades. The time has come in my life to liberate my recollecalls. Uh, recalulas. 'Uh, um, my memoirs.' Let me know if I miss anything, Sancho. Uh-oh! How about a flying chandelier? And a flying log! swoosh I shall begin with the first thing that strikes me. swoosh crash Oh, boy! You may not have to wait long. Everything's flying around here. I wonder what's next. Darn! After three centuries, I'm a little rusty. I'm next. [teeth chattering] Ghost! Gho-oo-oo-oo-st! Now he did say ghost. swoosh I must meet this Don Coyote on his own terms. [clattering] Make way for Elgordo! thud "Chapter one, part two." Hmm. Oh, yes. Ha.. "Crawling from the cradle or my head breaks the fall." screech So, it's true. Everyone's a critic. Don Coyote, I, Elgordo Delquavos Francheros challenge you to a duel to the death! I can't lose. I'm already dead. [evil laughter] [instrumental music] [Don] 'A duel? The perfect challenge.' [Elgordo] 'You are a worthy opponent, Don Coyote.' 'Too bad! I must run you through.' You furrow me, Elgordo. [grunting] But to no avail. I can run, Elgordo. But you can't hide. Well, here goes nothing. swoosh [screaming] screech swoosh [groans] Whoops! You need a little work on those stops. [Elgardo] Thrust and parry, parry and thrust. Bring them all on! The more the merrier! [clucking] [Don] For shame! A true knight never squats. [crashing] I-gardo-el-gard. Or, or is it uh, unguard Elgardo? Clever disguise, my fine-feathered fiend. But your flying friends will not save you now! Well, I have some who will. [dramatic music] [Desiree] 'There's the castle!' Izzie, you and your men, get ready to attack. [whistles] [male #1] 'Let's go, men!' Ooh-ooh! This is perfect. While my idiot half-brother occupies the ghost we'll sneak in and grab the chalice. Oh, my blushing begonia. You have done it again! [Elgardo] How do you like these friends, Don Coyote? One at a time would be more to my liking. Whoops! [clattering] Don't look now! 'But I think your friends have gone to pieces.' If someone could kindly give me a ha-a-a-nd! boing swoosh Drink? Don't mind if I do. slurp An empty vessel is a useless vessel. whoosh Useless? This is the Buckingham Chalice. And I'm sworn to defend it forever. Fine! Then we fight forever! Say! What's a Buckingham Chalice? Hold everything. So, you're not one of the bad guys here to steal the chalice? I'm here for the palace, not the chalice. [clattering] Then we are allies. Not opponents. 'Uh, just in time.' - Bad guys! - Bad guys! - Hee-haw! - Hee-haw! Oh, we'll have a dozen castles. With a servant for every room. - Thrust and parry. - Parry and thrust. No matter the billing, we're a team! Oh, Don Coyote, I sense intruders in my secret chamber. I must leave you to save the Buckingham Chalice. [clattering] Nothin' like a fallen friend to spur one on! Make way for Don Coyote! Take that! And that! [gasping] The chalice! Gone! Ah! And that's where it's gone, no doubt. - Which way? - I don't know. Thirty years, and I've never been here. [dramatic music] [clanking] Hold on, Don Coyote. swoosh Thank you, Sancho. With my lance there's always a chance. Whoops! I believe we're on a roll now, my friends. So, bad guys, do you wish to surrender? Surrender? I don't know the meaning of the word. You don't? Why, uh.. It means, uh, give up. Give out, give in. [rattling] It means, yield, concede, capitulate, carbuncle. I mean, uh, cry-uncle. [rattling] Ten to one, he don't get out of this one. No takers! My poor master. He doesn't stand a ghost of a chance. Ghost! Help! Help! 'Help! Help, Mr. Ghost!' Mr. Ghost, help! 'Don Coyote needs you, Mr. Ghost.' I ca-ca-ca-can't be-believe I called a g-g-ghost and he c-c-came! To save a fellow knight, always! Okay, okay, we surrender. Surrender? You mean, concede? Succumb, submit? Whatever! Just get us off this thing! [dramatic music] Jump, Don Coyote! What? And desert my ship? Never! splash On the other hand, deserting a sinking ship is only good common sense. I don't know how he does it, but he always does. Now, onto the castle, my friend. There's some unfinished business. [creaking] Phew! We're out of there. And we're out of here. I hate to leave him in my palace. Oh, let 'em have it. We have the wealth. [Elgardo] You check up here, and I'll check the secret passageway. Sounds like you're having all the fun. [creaking] Shh! We don't want that ghost to hear us. You got that right. Yoo-hoo! Elgardo! [indistinct yelling] crash [gasps] It's him! [gibberish] It's worse than him! [both screaming] swoosh crash [metal clanking] [crashing] Hmm! You think they'd seen a ghost. [laughing] No, but I bet they'd never seen that kind of nightmare in armor before. You sure you want to leave, Don Coyote? Memoirs can wait, Sancho. There are more adventures to the adventured. Besides, we've left the caskell in good hands. You think it's okay Don Coyote to leave the orphans with a ghost? Nonsense, Sancho! Everyone knows there's no such thing as ghosts. At least during the day. [laughing] I'll get you, you little rascals. [children laughing] You can't catch me! You can't catch me! Well, you can't win them all.
