Yeah. - You know him? - No. Throw the dice, bro. I don't know what's happening. I'll be right with you. May I help you? - What do you want? - Not a goddamn candy bar. There. Now get the hell out. What the fuck are you, a comedian? You trying to be funny? Listen, motherfucker, I am tired of niggas like you coming up in here with your little toys, trying to take some shit that don't belong to you. This is my shit. Get a fucking... Now I'm gonna count to three. A count is always good, yeah? One... Don't sneeze. Two... Wait wait! Okay. Okay. Fuck. Excuse you. Gosh. Mecca? Mecc... Fuck. Who the fuck are you? Honey, honey, I just got to page 83 and this is definitely one of your best scripts. I can't wait to see what happens next. I also can't wait till you get home. Love you for life. All right. - Maybe if we had the... - Happy anniversary! Ooh shit! - Wait. Wait wait wait wait! - Whoo! - Come on, man. - I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. - Baby, baby, I'm sorry. - What are they doing here? What were you... we're working on the script. It's our anniversary, Howard. Baby, i'm... are you okay? I'm fine! Just leave me alone. Baby, why aren't you at work? I left work early because I thought this was an important day. I promise you I'll make this up to you. What the hell is that supposed to mean? This is my career. And I am your wife. We'll have other anniversaries. I wouldn't bet on it, especially considering your poor gambling record. Hey, girl. Debbie, what are you doing here? What the hell are you doing here? What the hell am I doing here? Look, it is your anniversary, okay? You need to be home with Howard, fucking him. Well, how can I when he's at home fucking his $3 million script? - Well look, you can't stay here. - What? I got... I got shit to do. Go home, get those brothers out of your house and go be with your man. I'm not going back there. Look, Debbie, just today of all days, okay? Please, go home and be with him. I'm not going back there, tam. Case closed. Shit! All right, listen, the wife will be there when the waterbed guy arrives. No no. Let's have her go upstairs afterwards, then find the waterbed guy working on the bed. Yeah, then she fucks him in the bedroom. That's hot! Wait wait wait wait. And the husband is doing what? - He's asleep. - Yeah. - That's stupid and I don't like it. - Why why? Because it wasn't Howard's idea? Why does everything have to be your way or no way? Because it's my project. And if you don't like it, you know where the door is. Excuse me. I'm gonna go to the little boys' room. Little boys' room? You have to shit, man, or piss! What's with this little boys' room shit, tre? - You wanna hold it for me? - What the... Howard, man, I ain't used to this shit, b. He's fucking with me, man. Damn. Dessert?-. Tam, all you had was a salad, girl. And all I needed was a salad. How many fat black actresses do you know in Hollywood? I guess that's a no. Okay. Well, I'll be back with your check, all right? So you're really serious about this acting stuff. Yes, I am. I will be living in Beverly Hills one day. - That is a fact. - Okay then. You know what? You need to tell that brother that if he don't make you number one, you're gonna two-step your way out of his life. I'll never leave Howard. I've been in love with that man since I was a kid. He's the only man I've ever been with. You don't know what you're missing. Ladies, there's your bill. - Have a good afternoon, all right? Thank you. - Thanks. So where to now? I don't know. I say we go get those brothers out of your house. - No. - Well then, what, Deb? The mall. I've got it! - Hello. - Hey, how you doing, man? My car stopped just down the road and I was wondering if I could use your phone. I'll ride you... Meaning to your house or wherever you need to go. Thanks for the offer, but just the phone, please. Sure. - Yo, tre, who is it? - ♪ it's a man. Man, you better get in there, man. Damn! "It's a man." ♪ it's a man. What the fuck? Hey hey, so what's going on? Well, um, this gentleman's vehicle stopped running and it needs to be looked at. I offered. I'm... I'm sure you did. So what do you wanna do? You wanna use the phone, what? - If it's not too much trouble. - No, there's no problem. Normally I don't allow strangers into my home. Hey, I'm the same way. I understand perfectly. Howard, um, don't worry. I will keep my eyes on him. Man, the phone is over there, all right? - Thank you very much. - Yeah, no... no problem. - Thanks a lot. - What? So who's that? A beautiful creature of god. If you want me to stop talking about men, you stop talking about women. Men always talk about women, dumbass. - Yeah, that's what I'm saying. - Hey, yo yo! Hey, even this brother agrees with me. - About what? - Tell him, tell him. The woman should be there when the waterbed guy arrives. - Why? - What makes you an expert? - And who the hell are you? - This is... - Silk is the name. - Yeah yeah. See, I just happen to know women. Now if she was having an affair with the waterbed guy, she wouldn't be there so she can monitor her husband's movements. - It's just common sense. - Monitor. Well, I just ain't think of it like that. That's because you never think, period. Didn't you ride the short yellow bus to school? Nigga, shut your ass up. Sorry. That's the last area youwant closed. - You cats are funny, man. - Yeah well, I wish they'd put some of that funny stuff in the script. - Yeah yeah, well, I need a break. - I second that. Look look, no no no. We're not finished. Chill out, yo. Chill out, on the real. Nah, bro, I think he might be right, man. You know, a mind too active is no mind at all. What the fuck was that? One of aesop's greatest cliches? And what would you suggest, Mr. Silk? I'm glad you asked. Poker. Always works for me. All right, well, I don't usually partake unless the pot is sweet. Well, I got a couple of bucks to spare. You with it? Yeah well, yeah. Let's do this. Let's do this. - Howard. - What's up? - Let me talk to you real quick, b. - Okay. - Tre, you know... - So what do y'all like to play... - Five card or seven card? - How about stud? Yeah, so what's up? - You trust him? - Why? There's three of us and one of him. What's he gonna do? - I ain't afraid. Are you? - Please. Okay, well then, let's take his money and get back to work. Stop bitching. All right, deal 'em up. He was black, but not your style. - I'll be right back. - Ooh, shit. This is cute. Girl, turn the light on. Who's this? Let's go. Where are we going? I thought we were going to the mall. I shopped and found what I want. What? That. You've been holding out on me. I don't know who that is. Well, don't you think you need to find out? I mean, he is at your house. Well, apparently he's a friend of my husband's. I want him. You don't even know who he is. Debbie, god sent that man to me. You said that about the last 12 guys. Okay well, then maybe Satan sent him. I don't know and I don't care. I need to have that man. Ain't he hot? Just like the devil. Yeah, let's separate the boys from the men. Three Jacks. Yes yes! - Three aces. - Shit. - I don't have shit. - And my wife thanks you. So, what about you, Mr. Satin? I'm sorry. Mr. Silk. - I got deuces. - You know what I'm saying? This is not about whether you win or lose... - four deuces. Whoops. - Fuck! And I thought we were writing. And you must be the lady of the house. - Happy anniversary. - How did you know? Well, I saw the decorations and they're beautiful. - Thank you. - You're welcome. I'm glad somebody noticed them. Look, I need a beer. Does anybody want one? - Hit me up. - No, I'm good, man. Hi! I'm Tammy. - Hey, how you doing? - I didn't get your name. I don't remember giving it to you. Silk is the name. Silk. Interesting. I was conceived on silk sheets. But now I can't stay off of them. My god. Well, I have silk sheets on my bed. And so do I. I do! Ooh! You know, since you're the lady of the house, why don't you do the honors? - Excuse me? - No disrespect, bro. - I'll get it. - No disrespect. - My god. - Bullshit! - That's fucked up. - How did he do that? - I'd better be going now. - So soon? Yeah. Well, me and Debbie will walk you out. Okay. Thanks for the hospitality, fellas. - Good luck with the script. - Yeah. - Silk. - Yeah. I, um... I have something to ask you. What's up? I'll go wait outside with the guys. - No. - Yes. They will need an actress's point of view on the script, so I will go give it to them. Okay. Listen, don't be a stranger. - Take care. - All right. Well, I guess you're wondering what this is about. You're bored with your husband. You want to spend the rest of your life with me. Am I close? That's funny. Not to you. Let me guess... You're an artist, right? That's something I used to enjoy doing. Yeah? Tell me about it. Well, my dad was an artist. He passed away when I was six and left me all his materials. From that point on I painted every day. - Wow. - I loved it. - You did this? - Yeah. That's my favorite. It's called "life." Now how did you come up with a name like that? I didn't. My dad did. That was a painting he had started just before he died. I finished it. Now he's living, so to speak. - "Life"... I like that. - Thank you. So, why did you stop painting? I got married. Marriage stopped you from doing something you loved? Well, we moved to L.A., spent a couple of years there. Then my mom passed away and left us this house, and now we're here. So why did you stop? Traveling and Howard needing my support - with his career. - Well, what about you? Don't you have a career? I'm a secretary at an insurance agency. Now that sounds fulfilling. You mind if I take you up on that beer? This way. Why are you trying to change our story, man? I'm trying to give it to you from another perspective, Maurice. - Damn, hos are always trying to change shit. - Who you calling a ho? First of all, why are you out here? Second, how the hell would you know what a wife would do when you have never been married? Look, I don't have to be married, okay? I've had plenty of experiences, I'll have you know. - You get it, girl. - Not like that. Ho ho ho, exactly like that. You wanna know something, Howard? If you wasn't Debbie's husband I would tell you to kiss my pretty ass. And if you weren't her best friend, I would tell you to suck my... - excuse me, do we really need to go there? Go where? Debbie, Debbie, Debbie. So did you talk to him? I, um... I haven't told him yet. Well, what were y'all doing? He was looking at my paintings. Debbie, you need to be painting a picture of me and making it look like a batisse. - Matisse. - Whatever! I will, okay? I will. But I think I should go tell Howard what I'm doing. No no no no no no. You don't need to tell him anything, okay? I don't need him fucking with my future. So how's the writing coming? They're still at it. Well, thank you very much for this beer. It definitely hit the spot. We sort of got off the subject. Um... I didn't really know we were on a subject. Well, my girlfriend Tammy, she's... she's interested in you. - Really? - She's nice and easy-going. My interest lies elsewhere. So you're involved with someone? Not yet, but soon... Very very soon. - Ouch. - You okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. - Well, you don't look fine. I hurt it earlier, but I'm fine. - Let me take a look at it. - It's okay. Please. I want to help you. - Okay? - Look... - Come here. - What are you doing? You gotta take the weight off that foot. My husband... Don't even worry about him. This'll only take a minute. Okay? Come here. Come here. Come here. Don't worry. Don't worry. It'll take you just a minute, all right? There. All right. How's that? So you think I should paint again? - Definitely, full time. - That's a risk. The universe will reward you for taking risks on its behalf. The universe? So what should I paint? Whatever's on your mind. My husband, my job, bills... None of those represent the true you. That's what's on my mind. - Close your eyes. - Why? Well, I shut my eyes in order to see. I want you to try. I see better with them open. Then what you're seeing, sweetheart, just ain't worth painting. Now I want you to go back. Where? To the realm of your childhood. No peeking. - My childhood. - Yes... No husband, no job, no bills. I want you to release your mind, body and soul. Your life is now carefree. You are now in a place where logic and common sense just won't interfere with your vision. You have escaped all human limits. Now you can just be you... No one to judge you, no one to say no to you. Everything in this place is just right. Smell the sweet scent of the blossoming flowers. Just right? Listen to the sound of the ocean. Let your body flow with the waves. What are you desiring? What are you craving? Just ask for it and you shall receive it. All I wanted... Hey, what are you doing up there? Baby, what are you doing on the counter? Well, I, um... I reinjured my ankle. Well... well, maybe I should come and look at it. No no, I'm okay. - I'm fine. - Obviously. - So, how's the... the... - writing. Writing, yeah. How's it going? It's going... baby, are you sure you're okay? Yeah, I'm okay. I'm fine. Everything's, well, fine. - Okay, well, I really should... - no no. Howard, I want you to take me in the bedroom and make love to me like you've never done before. No. Baby, but I need you. - Babe, baby... - I need you. Baby, baby, baby, look, now you know I can't leave those idiots out there by themselves. It's been a month. Come on now, you're exaggerating. Actually, it's been two months. Okay okay, look. I promise when we're done, I'll come in and we can... We can do a little something. Cool? Cool. All right. And by the way, could you please tell that bitch... I ain't going nowhere. This is my house. No, this is Debbie's house. Her mother left it for her. - Your broke ass don't own shit. - You know what? - You got one more time to disrespect me. - Or what? My cousin'll be down here so fast you wouldn't know what to do. You two used to get along so well. - What happened? - I was faking it. - Where's my man? - I don't know. - Well, where did he go? - We were talking and I turned my back, he disappeared. Disappeared? So what? Poof, just like that? What is he, a fucking magician? You know what? Never mind. Did you tell him about me? He said his interest lies elsewhere. Okay. So he got a woman. They married? We didn't get into all that. Well, damn, Debbie, what did you get into? You was with him forever. What? Nothing. - Why are you looking down there. - Nothing. What... What are these doing on the floor? What? What are you talking about? Nuh. I know you didn't. No, you didn't. No! Girl, why would I do something like that? I'm married! This is my anniversary. And obviously it didn't make a bit of difference. - Come on, tam. - "come on, tam," nothing. You know what, Debbie? I could care less what you do to that sorry-ass husband of yours. But what you did to me... That's fucked up. You know what? You foul. Tam. Tam! God. Can I help now, daddy? Not now, sweetheart. I wanna paint just like you when I grow up. - Why? - Because I love you. Well, I love you too, sweetheart. I love you so much. And one day you'll paint better than me. All right, you take this brush. I want you to put some purple down on that where the dark side is. There we go. Right... yeah, right there on that. There we go. Very good. Very very good. That's very... Hey, Howard, this is not a script note. I was just wondering if you would object to me painting again full time. Think about it and let me know. I love you. Yo, how, we need to talk about this money shit, yo. What about it? All right, so all we have to do is finish this script and we get 3 mil from your contacts in L.A.? Yes, I mean, for... What... the 30th time. What, you don't trust me? I mean, it ain't that, man. It's just, you know, making sure we ain't wasting our time when we're gonna have to kick ass. Look, man, I totally understand, okay? But trust me, I'm gonna take care of both of you. I won't let you down. - Cool. - All right? Let's just take care of this. But on the real, man, I think we should call it a day. - What? Why? - Because he's tired. I'm tired. It's your anniversary. I am not happy with my life. I can't make her happy. We need to finish this script. Then you'd better be aware of the waterbed guy. The waterbed guy? - Well well. - Aw, shit. - Big mo. - What did I do now? - You tell me. - God. Shit, I'm clean, dawg. Can I help you, officer? An escaped convict was spotted in this area last night. - From Mansfield. - Yeah, and he's very dangerous. Excuse me, officer, if you don't mind telling us, what was he in jail for? - That's not important. - Come on, come on, man. You gots to give us the lowdown on this gangster. - I might know him. - And if you do? Well, that depends on who it is, officer. - He's a male gigolo. - A prostitute? A high-class prostitute. Well, you might know him, tre. Seems he fell in love with one of his married clients. He was serving a life sentence for killing her husband. - What? - His name is Andrew Anderson. - He may be going by an alias though. - Fuck! - What? You seen him? - He was here, man. - This man was here? - Yes! - We played cards with him. - Which way did he go? Hey, Pete Walker. So who's up for another game of poker? - What the... - Were you thinking about me? - What the hell are you doing in here? - Nobody's here. We've got the whole place to ourselves. - Just stop! - I'm just trying to get your robe for you, baby. Okay, go. - So did you miss me? - Where's my husband? You weren't thinking about him before. I don't know why you're thinking about him now. - Look, I am a married woman. - Yeah, I know. But you don't want him like you want me. Look, I don't want you! So who were you making love to just now? It damn sure wasn't your husband. Well, it damn sure wasn't you. Where you going? They're gone. See? I told you. Beer? The refrigerator's full of them. Look, it's time for you to go. I'd rather stay. Look, I know what happened earlier was a mistake. - In whose eyes? - Mine. You wanted me, Debbie. - You... - You still do. You are really trippin'. We're soul mates, baby. If you don't leave, you're gonna meet your cell mate. - You're still here? - Where are you going? To find my husband and bring his behind home. - Now get out. - Let me go with you. - No. - I know what bar they went to and we can take the motorcycle. Vroom vroom. Why are we stopping? - Why are we stopping? - Come on. - Debbie? - Yes. - How did you know my name? - Your husband's here. - He is? - Yes. Just take a left at the last exhibit. Thank you. Why did you lie to that lady? She told you? I don't see anything funny. It's just wishful thinking, sweetheart. Look, silk, I want to go home. What do you think about this one? Did you hear what I just said? See, your work is so much better than this stuff, especially the "life" painting. Yeah, I can see that in a place like this. You know, every child's an artist. The only problem is how to remain an artist once he's grown up. Pablo Picasso. You're a reader. Well, I've had a lot of time over the past few years. Why is that? Just had the time. What do you think about this? It's all right. Yeah, but... See, there's something wrong with this one, but I just can't pinpoint it. If this was your work of art, what would you have done differently? The textures are a little dull. Probably created more depth to the background by using a darker contrast than the normal blue that's used. The trees are too modern for a period piece. That dark green grass is too dominant. Many interesting shapes and figures going on, but I don't quite understand what this artist is trying to say, except for maybe the grass was green in the early 19th century. See, with my art, I want people to look at it, admire it, take something from it... You know, something that will help them in their lives maybe. I'd die to have my paintings up in a place like this. Well, you know what? You've grown up and you're still an artist. Please don't throw that gift away. Howard? Honey? - You can wait right here. I'll be right back. - Okay. I'll be right here. God. I don't understand him. Where... - What are you doing? - Isn't it obvious? - Get out! - I think you're trapped in a life you desperately want out of. I think I'm your answer. I think I can give you what you want - and what you need. - I want you to leave. What you want and what you need are attention, support, respect, but most of all you need to be stimulated. What happened to love? For people like us, love just ain't got shit to do with it. Silk, you need to get out of the jacuzzi, please. You and I are risk takers. Don't you understand? We like to live dangerously. But you can't do that now, can you? You can't do that with your... With your husband. And you think you're the man for the job? The kitchen counter, the bathtub... It's not a bad resume if you ask me. You're funny. Come on, it's time for you to go. What are you doing? Stop, no no... No, stop! - god. What happened, baby? Who did this to you? I wouldn't do that. Step away, sweetheart. You did this? Untie him! - I can't do that. - Why are you doing this? I want you to go downstairs, Debbie. - Why? - Because I said so! Excuse me, baby. - Why... - Sit your ass down. Why are you doing this? Why are you doing this? Hey, I want you to go away with me. No, so untie them. You know, from the moment we met I knew we were made for each other. - You're crazy. - Yes, I know. I'm crazy about you. And I know you feel the same way. I don't know what's going on, but I need for this to stop, okay? Now just release them. - Are you going away with me? - Hell no! That's very disappointing. So how long will it take for you to pack? Sweetheart, I'm talking to you. - Why? - I want you, and normally I get what I want. Baby, you don't have to be scared of me. I would never ever ever hurt you, okay? Come here. Give me a hug. Please, no. Okay, obviously you need time to think about this and I need time to get rid of his car. You know I hate doing this to you, right? Hey, how's it going, buddy? Hey, can I ask you a question? I'll take that as a yes. How do you feel about your wife wanting another man? I know that's gotta hurt in here, doesn't it? Yeah, I'm pretty sure it does. See, Howie, I've known guys just like you ever since I was in high school. I know you more than you know your wife. When was the last time you made her come? Can't remember, can you? Well, for your information, I've known her a few hours and she's come twice... Maybe three times. I lose count. So why don't I give you guys a chance to talk some things out, you know, say your goodbyes and stuff like that? I'll be back. You'll never get away with it. What what what? Did you write that line yourself? No wonder you're a starving artist, no-talent motherfucker. Sweetheart, love you. Take it light. I'll be back, bros. I'll be back. Hey, Howie, hope you don't mind if I borrow some of this plastic. Don't wanna fuck up your pretty-ass carpet. You know, i... I really do hope it was worth it, you know? Three years of marriage thrown away for some quick dick. Did you use a condom? In the jacuzzi... now that... Now that was creative. Shit, maybe I need to have him write the script. Speaking of which, is that the way this... This marriage thing works? I mean, I bust my ass making countless sacrifices so you can be happy. But the minute I need you, my wife, to stand by me and be patient, you betray me like this! Are you that pathetic? I'm sorry. I am so sorry. You're a sorry little bitch, all right. You know, maybe if you were fucking me I wouldn't have had to fuck him. So this is... this is my fault? You wanna blame this shit on me? Howard, this is not the time nor the place to be talking about this! Yeah, well, if your boyfriend has his way, we'll never talk about it again. You see that blood right there, Howard? That could be our blood if we don't do something right now! Help! Nobody is going to hear that. Well, we've got to do something. Trust me, you've done enough. Youinvited him into our home. But that doesn't give you the right to fuck him. You two okay? Whoo! That was a workout. I'm back. Did y'all miss me? - Thank you. - You're quite welcome. What you gonna do with us? Well, that depends on the lady of the house. You can have her. - Howie, are you mad at me? - She's all yours. - What, no fight? - No, he's not. You see that, baby? This is what I'm talking about. See how they're ready to throw you to the wolves? See, I would never do something like that. What do you think, big boy? Fuck that. I ain't dying for no bitch. No! - Don't you ever in your motherfucking life talk about my woman like that. - You understand me? He understands you, silk. - He understands. - You're gonna kill us, aren't you? Shut your faggot ass up! Now... Sweetheart, see, normally I'm not like this. You understand? I'm sorry you had to go through all that. Look, it's been a long evening. I want you to go lay down. - I'm fine. - No, you're not. Come on, let's go. Come on, it's okay. He doesn't care. Come on. You better put a smile on that face before I smack one on for you. Silk, stop, please! You know, where I'm from we used to fuck brothers just like you for lunch. Then your faggot ass need to be talking to tre. Motherfucker! Okay, that's enough, silk. I want to go to bed. I want to go lie down now. You're so fuckin' lucky. You'll be the first to go. That's a promise. Okay? I promise you. That's a promise. It'll be all right. Yo... About that comment, man... It's all right. I understand. - We're all upset. - Thanks. Mo, man, I know this... This situation is... Look, man, all I'm saying is don't go committing suicide with this idiot. Man, he ain't gonna let us go. We can identify his ass. We can do something. I'm not ready to die. Ain't none of us trying to die, b. Shit! You know, man, y'all introduced me to this writing shit, man, gave me hope. I wasn't trying to do this. It was probably hood-ass mo. Go back to prison or some shit like that, man. But this script, man... It was my ticket. It was... it was my ticket to fix some stupid-ass mistakes I made in my life, man. Look, don't tear up that ticket just yet. The way I see it, dawg, it's already torn... Into pieces. Man. You never gave up on me, b. I just wanna let you know that I never gave up on you, no matter how gay your ass is. See, nigga, right here I was with you. You feelin' me? Do you feel me? Thanks. Yeah. Don't matter, b. What's this shit about? I don't know. Baby, you don't have to lie to me, okay? Just tell me you don't wanna talk about it. How do you expect us to have anything after all this? We were meant for each other. And when two people belong together, nothing can tear them apart. We'll be running from the law for the rest of our lives. I know. Doesn't that sound exciting? No, not at all. But it will be. Trust me. I plan on filling your life with so much joy... Something that you haven't had in a while. I need a drink. You need a drink? Like what, water? A glass of wine would be more sufficient. Where do you keep your bottles? In the kitchen. Honey, I can't leave you alone. - I'll be fine. - But I won't. Now I'll go in that bathroom, get you a nice, cool glass of tap water. Okay? You got cups in there? All right. I'll be right back. By the way, honey, I disconnected the phone. I hope you don't mind. What some people would do for a glass of wine. Don't make me get ugly, okay? - You already are. - No, I haven't been yet. But I'll show you ugly. - I keep my promises. - Fuck your life! No, fuck yours. - Ooh! - No! No. Honey, did you see what you made me do? I could've been out of the country by now. But no, I had to fall for you. So why don't you just stop fucking around, pack your shit, come with me, and nobody else has to die. What do you think? What do you think? Do you need some more persuasion? Howie, you're up, brother. - Open your mouth. - No! Open your motherfucking mouth! Now, Debbie, I will blow this pretty motherfucker's brains all over the back wall if you ever disobey me. What do you think? I'll do anything you want. Now I'm glad to see we're on the same page finally. Come here. Come here. You'll be all right. You'll be all right. You'll be all right. You might wanna pack something heavy, just in case it gets a little chilly. I know things may seem a little awkward right now, but just give it time. Everything will work out. Here's your shirt back. Damn! Tre, look, come on, man. You can't give up now. He may still just let us go. Take a good look, Howard. He's gonna kill us just like he killed mo. Shit, you still crying and whimpering and shit? - God damn. - Why don't you leave him alone? You talkin' to me? You talkin' to me? You're a sick motherfucker. That cracked me up. Who is that, man? You're a movie man. I asked you a question, Howie. Robert De Niro. Thank you very much. - Good boy. - Okay, can we just leave now? Come on, Tammy, we need to talk about this. - It's about time. - What do you want? - Um, not you. - Debbie is not here. Why are you lying? She'll be back later, Tammy. You know something? I don't like the way you treat her. What? Look, I gotta go. I am not done with you. - What? - What did you do with the rest of the money? What money? The last $10,000 from her mother's insurance policy? Look, that is really none of your business. But if you must know, I lost it gambling. You know what, Howard? You are so pathetic. You don't deserve her. - Debbie ain't no Saint. - And neither are you. - Are you finished? - Nigga, move. - Where is she? - She is not here. What was that? I don't know. It's probably tre. Goodbye. You tell Debbie to call me when she gets home. And do something with the phone. It's broke just like you. Very good. Very good. $10,000 gambling? Stupid motherfucker. And you stayed with this nigga? Look, I don't care about that money. All right, baby, calm... Hey hey, don't fuckin' forget, nigga. Just calm down, all right, baby? Okay? Get the fuck downstairs, stupid. Fuck. You'll be all right. Pretty motherfucker. You still mad at me, baby? Now... So what am I gonna do with you two? We won't say anything. And how would I know that? I guess you'll just have to trust us. No, I'd never trust a man that steals $10,000 from his wife. So, gay pride... How do you wanna die? - Please. - No no no no, seriously. Have you ever thought about your death? - Please god, don't. - I asked you a question! Why don't you leave him alone? You like that? You like that, don't you? You fuckin' bitch. Yeah, but I bet he'd whup your ass. Haven't you had enough of betting me? - If he wins, you let us go. - Howard! - This could be fun. - Not for you. So what if I win? - I guess we're dead. - No, that's... that's ridiculous. - I agree. - No no. It sounds like a good idea... A great one even. May the best man or queer win. - I won't want to fight. - Come on, man. Come on. Please, I don't wanna fight you. I'm not trying to hear all that. Howie, I thought you said this faggot could fight. What happened? You ready to die, motherfucker? You ready? What's up, man? Boy, you shouldn't have done that. Come on, bitch. I know bitches can fight. Come on. Come on. Bitch! I knew faggots couldn't fight. Howie, I'm sorry to say it, but it looks like you lost another bet, man. So now the question is how do you wanna die? With a two-by-four, motherfucker! Who's the bitch now? Who's the bitch? What is going on down here? Tre, what are you doing? - You don't understand. - Get off of him! What's wrong with you? Are you crazy? - What is wrong with you? - You don't understand! I'll take it from here. Have you ever heard the phrase "the wrong place at the wrong time"? Get the fuck over there. Come on. - My god, is that mo? - Yeah. He had an attitude problem, so I fixed it. He didn't do anything to you! Are you raising your voice at me? You're gonna kill me anyway. So go ahead and do it. Go ahead and do it! If you insist. Shh! God damn, girlfriend, that shit looked like it hurt. I thought you would be dead by now. I guess faggots just don't die easy. No! What's up, man? Come here, baby. Let me get you out of this stuff. What's the matter, baby? Why are you looking like that? Come here. Come here. - What's the matter? - I hate you. - Honey, please don't say that. - I hate you! Come here. Come here. Is she always like this? Maybe you would know. You sore fucking loser! - Who's that? - You are. It's just a matter of time. Well, not to state the obvious, but you're in no position to make threats. I will be. Howie, you got about five minutes left on this earth. Please don't waste it making idle threats. Shit. Why women always gotta make shit difficult? Debbie, listen up, lover. Please don't try anything stupid, or your horny-ass friend is dead, okay? Tre's covered. Let's go. - Okay, they're upstairs now. Tammy, come to papa, baby. You go get the police and I'll stay and help Tammy. I am not leaving you here with him. Shh shh. Silk won't hurt me. You know he won't. Now where would a skeezer like you hide, Tammy? No, not under the bed. No, that's too easy. But... Let's just find out. Hey, Tammy, how about we play a game? I'll shoot under there. And if you're under there... Well, let's just see what happens. On three. A count is always good. One, two, thr... All right, okay okay! Come on. Come on. Why would you run from me? Don't run, tam. Is that safe? Come here. Debbie said you liked me. You ain't acting like you like me. Honey, we're back. Surprise! It's over, you asshole! - What? - Yeah. - Debbie, don't do this. - Now what? - Get your ass down there. - What, nigga? Get down there. - Get the fuck up. - You got him, Tammy? Stop acting like you can't walk. Move! You smiling! Move! Get up! Get up! Sit down. - Why don't you make up your mind? - Sit! What the fuck are you gonna do now? Do I sense a little deja vu here? Yeah. Maybe she'll shoot you just like you shot them. Well, I wasn't really talking about that. Well, I was. - But where's Howard? - He's getting the police. Yeah well, I don't wanna wait. I wanna shoot this motherfucker right now. No no, it's too easy. I just love a violent woman. Really? Somebody tell me what the fuck is going on. I can answer that. Debbie and I are running away together. I would never run away with you. I guess now is the wrong time to ask for a kiss? No no no, fuck that slapping shit. It tastes almost as good as your pussy. Baby girl, you don't know how much I love pain, especially when it's coming from you. Really? Really? - Let's just see about that. Yeah. What the fuck are you doing? I'm giving you love, baby boy. I know ain't about to cut my shit off. Yes, we are, Mr. Motherfuckin' lover. - Who let a motherfucker out? - Debbie, don't fucking do that shit. - Don't do that shit. - It ain't like you could use it in jail. - Or maybe you can. - Don't do that shit. We won't be able to make love no more. You fuckin' punk, take it like a man! - You don't wanna do that. - On three. - Debbie! Don't do it. - A count is always good. - Don't play with me. Listen to me. - One... - Don't fuckin' do this shit! - Two, three! Wait! What the hell is going on here? - Where are the cops? - They're on their way. I came back to help you two. Yeah well, as you can see, we are doing just fine. What are you gonna do with that in your hand? And I'm not talking about the knife. Look, he's not worth it. Look, why didn't you bring the cops with you? I'm glad I didn't or else you two would be going to jail right along with him. - Do you know how to use that? - Yes, I do. I don't need no college degree to pull a motherfucking trigger. Then you should know when the safety is on. Thank you. Debbie, you all right? I... I need to get out of here. - Let's wait outside. I can't let you do that, baby. God. We can't let you do that. What are you doing? Taking Hollywood by storm, baby. What the hell does that mean? It means your husband sold you out - for a break into Hollywood. - What? Once the media finds out about the massacre that went on here tonight, everybody's gonna want my story. I'll be an instant success. Now I know that this may come as a surprise to you two, but none of the scripts that I wrote previously sold. But this one... this one's gonna sell big-time. Let me get this straight. You had your writing partners killed for a story you haven't even sold yet? Think about it. They were the perfect victims for my real-life drama... Gullible and stupid. I mean, can you believe that they fell for that line about the $3 million? They deserve to be dead. Ignorance like that can be dangerous. So I guess you were gonna have me killed as well. - You sick, mother... - Whoa whoa whoa whoa. - Back it up. Back it up. - Go ahead, make his day. Clint Eastwood, "dirty Harry." When did you two become such good friends? - Who the fuck are you? - Look, man, just calm down. I just wanna talk to you, okay? We're not good friends. We're business partners. I made him an offer he couldn't refuse. - Who's that? - The godfather. Let me guess... $10,000. Well, actually five. But we're gonna discuss the other five in a minute. So that's where the money went. The price of fame can be costly. Where did you go with my bike? That wasn't part of the plan. Just having a little fun. You know what they say, "all work and no play," et cetera, et cetera. - Fun. - Yeah. Is that like... Like killing a cop? Or... or could that mean more like shoving your gun 6" down my throat? But you know, the real joy... the real joy came as I got to watch you stick your 3" dick into my wife. See, now that's a lie. I stuck an 8" dick into your wife. Yeah. Silk, look, I know that this is your first acting gig and there are things that you may or may not know, so I'll help you out. The way that actors, you, make their money, the thousands of dollars that I'm paying you, is that they don't change my lines, meaning they don't fuck with my script. If you wanna have fun, do it on your off day. You know, like a mailman. Now did anybody see you? - No. - Good good. Very good. Can you believe we did it? We fuckin' did it. So you mean after all that bullshit you just said, you approve of my performance? Yeah! I mean, all things considered. I mean, especially... Especially... I love the way you just shoot. I mean, without hesitation. Just like, "I keep my promises." So... How are you planning on doing my wife? What, bullet to the head? Knife to the throat? Don't tell me. You're gonna fuck her brains out. Look, man, have some of this and lighten up. No, I'll pass. Silk, don't be a pussy. Howie, you'd better watch your fuckin' mouth. Fuck you. Fuck who? So this is how you treat the guy who saved your balls? - Howie, I don't give a fuck about you. Where's the other half of my money? You're not finished yet. All right, I'll take out the wife and the girlfriend. And I want my money and I'm getting the fuck out of dodge. - Tammy is off-limits. - Why? I told you, I wanna do her myself. It's personal. You fuck! Thank you. Fuckin' actors. I think that, um... Wethink that your plan is brilliant. Really? Yeah. Yeah, we think it'll work. And we wanna help. Well, I'm surprised to hear you say that. Well, you shouldn't be. I mean, Howard, you are one of, - if not the most intelligent men... Where were you? Hello? Where have you been? I had to make a run. In the middle of the fuckin' plan? Look, forget it. Forget it. It's time. You're a fool, man. What? Why? For throwing all this away for a fantasy. We live in a sensational society, my friend. You understand? The world of reality pictures in television. I mean, they can't get enough of this blood and Gore stuff. What if nobody wants your shit? They'll want it, believe me. And the risk of losing a woman like Debbie is worth it? Debbie? Silky, you fucked Debbie right in my fuckin' jacuzzi! With your fuckin' help! Yeah. But the only thing that matters is that she did it. Just like that? Yeah, just like that. Well, ladies, this is it. I prefer to do this from the back. Pretty faces make me weak. - Can we talk? - Let's just get this over with. Please? I really need to speak with you. What's up? I... since we've been here, I've had some time to do some soul searching. And... well, what I'm really trying to say is that now that I know my husband really doesn't give a damn about me, I'm a free woman. And, like you suggested, I'm gonna let my body flow with the waves. You remember it? Of course. You asked me what I was desiring, what I was craving. And you said to just ask and I'll receive. What do you want? I want to live dangerously and flow with the waves. So what are you saying? The waves are flowing in your direction. - Debbie, don't do this. - Shut up. I've been trapped in Howard's world for far too long. Now I need to be with someone who stimulates me. And, silk, you are definitely the man for the job. I was hired to kill you. Howard's plan can still work without killing me. - And me. - Come on. You said it yourself. You said it... you and I are risk takers. Hey, let's just take a risk and get the hell out of this city and the hell out of this country. You know, your offer almost sounds sincere. Don't doubt me, silk. You know how I feel about you. The kitchen counter, the bathtub. What? Did I miss something here? If I thought you were serious, maybe I would... How could I prove it to you? You can give me a sneak preview of what to expect. I thought I already did that. I want you to do me. Do you how? Don't be so naive, Debbie. He wants you to suck that dick. Baby. You're gonna get that and much more when we get out of here. I want it now. What... how... I can't do that in front of her. - I fuckin' knew it. - Silk. Look, you said that you would respect me. Now sucking your dick in front of my friend here is not my idea of respect. Yeah, you're right. Thank you. Let's go upstairs. I think you should go. And suck it good, because our lives depend on it. You don't know how long I've been waiting to do this. Tell me. I'd rather show you. No, I'm shy. Baby, do your thing. Is it done? Sorry to disappoint you. Whoa whoa, baby. Don't shoot, okay? And you said I was pathetic? I loved you since I was a child. Didn't care if you had a dime, a penny or a pot to piss in. The only thing that mattered to me was that you and I were together. Well, baby, look, just... just give me a second to think and we can still be together. No no no no no. No. You ruined everything, Howard. No no, baby. I can fix this. I mean, writing is rewriting. I can just change the ending. - I can make you the hero. - Howard, the computer is turned off! Baby, look, you don't understand what it's like to want something... I mean, to want something so bad, so goddamn bad, that the only thing that matters is that. That takes time, Howard! I thought you knew that. Baby, my time is running out! You're still young. You had your whole life ahead of you. And you had me. I loved you unconditionally. I was your biggest supporter. I gave up my dreams because of you. And this... This is how you repay me? Baby, you're right. I mean, you were the perfect wife. I had to find a way to make you unperfect. I told silk to give me a reason to hate you and he delivered. You tricked me into having an affair? What... what... I just stopped making love to you. You had the affair on your own. - Let's go. - Where? - Jail. - Come on, Debbie. - Baby, don't do this! - Move move! Hey, it's me. Shit! I can't go to jail, baby. Move, get in here. I said get in here. Look, you can give me my gun back now. I see we're in control again. What are you, stupid? I'm in control. You wanna be like that? Okay okay. Look, Debbie, honey, baby, sugar, listen. All we have to do is say that silk is responsible for this whole massacre and we're home free, home free. Baby, please, tell me that I can depend on you. God damn it, Debbie! Don't make this difficult. I'm trying to save your life, our lives. Fuck! Okay, just think. Let me just think. Hey. Well? Well, what? Howard, don't fuckin' do this. Look, she won't listen to me, so you'd better talk to her. - You fuckin' promised. - Look, I am not going down alone. What the hell is going on here? You promised to wait until this was over. Well, Tammy, shit has changed. You're just a fuckin' little shit! God, no no. Debbie, I am so sorry. Why? You were my best friend, for Christ's sakes. I trusted you! Debbie, it sounded like a good idea at the time. I don't... fuckin' Howard! - What, killing me was a good idea? - No no. I mean... I don't know. I don't know. I was just... just looking at the big picture. Money and fame. I never thought I would feel like this. Hey hey hey hey, me neither. You shut up! You shut your mouth! What? What? You fuckin' him too? Well, whoo. You're good, tam. You're good. You did tell me you'd be living in Beverly Hills one day. I just didn't think you'd... You'd lose your integrity to get there. As much as I hate to break up this great dialogue, we need to make a decision? So you were gonna be the star of the movie? What the fuck do you think? Howie, why didn't you tell me she was involved? Are you talking to me? Because my fuckin' name is not Howie. It's Howard! And that information, you sick dying son of a bitch, is none of your damn business, okay? What? Have y'all made a decision? I said have you made a fuckin' decision? Go, Debbie! Get the fuck out of here. She's dead. Baby. Baby. You'll never die. You hear me, baby? I took care of it for you. Get away from her. I said get away from her. No loose ends, right? I should have expected it. Don't hesitate, Howie. And this is our most recent painting. It's by a father and a daughter, and they call it "life." That's when he, he... He killed mo. And then he killed tre. And he brought us up here... me... me and Debbie. And she tried to... she tried to run and he... I tried... If it hadn't been for Tammy, i... That son of a bitch. That son of a bitch! Look, you did a good thing here. And, ma'am, you're a hero. Now my best friend is dead. I ain't no hero. Hey, Andrew Anderson can't hurt anybody else anymore, and you two are responsible for that. All right. All right, we'll finish this later. Well... We did it. A bittersweet victory. Yeah. But it's still a victory. And I can't wait for the celebration. Anderson, you are lucky. Damn you're lucky. What? What, did you find something? It's still recording, sir. Play it back.
