Irina, Dad's coming. - Don't say a word to him. - Viki, I can't breathe! Let her go! - Get off her! - Girls, what are you doing? - Irina hit me! - I was sleeping! You know how late it is? You were supposed to change the sheets. - They're not my family. - Auntie says it's your turn. How old are you? - What have you done, Viki? - It's always my fault! Iura will be here any minute. Look what you've done! - He's bringing a gift from London. - I know, s*cker! Mădă, why are you still here? Irina, come down, your dad will be here soon. What got into your sister? Just make up. Are you going to ask him? Little cousin, you're late with issuing the invoices for the providers again. I promised you I'll... - Weren't you going to town? - Yes, I met a friend who can help. Please leave. I want to change. Come downstairs, alright? - Who are you looking for? - The runts. Like I had time to wake them up! Viki was here earlier. Don't leave your mug unwashed! - Yeah, Gabi, sure. - I'll get you for it! Viki! Cousin! - What is it, Liviu? - Where's the runt? - Put a shirt on! - Yeah, Mum. You know what time it is, cousin? Come down, your dad's almost here. - Will you ask him? - It was Mădă's turn to change them. Irina, it's almost noon! Is this any hour to wake up? I asked you something! Where's your sis? I told you to stick to your cleaning duties! Ask Mădă to clean up. And come downstairs. Victoria! - Who let it out? - I don't know, Boss! - Take it back! - Yes sir! Ită! Ită, where are you? - They're here! - I'm coming! - Dad, how are you? - Good. Hey, little sis. Missed you. - How was your trip? - Good, thank you. - Let's chat, Irina. - Just a moment. Iri. Go sit with your dad, try to talk to him about university. OK Mum. - Viki, go with your sister. - Mum! What's wrong with the university in our town? You call that a university? Borrowed spaces, borrowed professors. Your mum says you want to study in Bucharest. I don't want to trouble you. I don't stand a chance in London anyway. You'd be alone in Bucharest. In London you'd live with your brother. Irina, is Dad teaching you how to be the regiment whore? Victoria, you've had such a foul mouth since the event! Coco, do you know about "the event"? Our parents divorced 7 years ago and we moved to the middle of nowhere. Here, they call Dad "the deceased", their marriage "the period". Your being born during their marriage is "the surprise". Viki, that's enough, please. Pipe down, the tourists will hear. I can't help you much in Bucharest, though your granddad taught there. What do you have in mind? The Academy? Strategy, Security? I might still convince you to come to London. I could help you get in there. You can help by paying my rent in Bucharest. Irina, we'd pay your rent, of course. But you have all you need here. Dad, let her be. Cristi, you've managed on your own, but she's a girl. She can't be alone in London! Times have changed, let her study. - Sure, but why London? - She could stay to do our accounts. Really, cousin? We've kept her fed. All we got from you, Iura, were postcards. Leni, leave it. You think studying pays? In my day, competition wasn't tight, but a degree won't do you any good. Irina will do what she wants! Maybe, but she'll crawl back to the ones who raised her. It's not her fault Dad went whoring! Viki, the tourists will hear you! Viki, please, you're completely out of line. Leave her alone, Mum. - Where are you going? - Viki, you f*cking brat! Leni, stop it! Let her be. Victoria, did my sister drop you on the head when you were born? - Leni, that's enough! - The tourists will hear! There, there now. Let me find you something serious in London. - I don't want to come to London. - Why not? I want to go to Bucharest. - When does your course finish? - In three months. Let's talk again. Maybe I can get you to come to London. - No, I'll apply here in summer. - Alright. - Take care. - You too, Dad. Call me. And talk to your aunt and uncle. Coco! Look after your step sister. - Have fun, stay off the firewater! - I'll save you some. He'll be fine! We'll get him to bring water, milk a cow or two... - When's your next class? - On Tuesday. - So we drive you down to town? - Yes. - And you stay in town overnight? - Yes, at Cristi's. Again? - Should I come back up? - No. But you're going to the providers with Liviu on Wednesday morning. - Keep an eye on him. - I need to work on my project. Do that in your own spare time. Wednesday morning is taken. End of discussion! Hey, bookworm! Get your sister. Let's go to the pond. No. So after class you' stay at Cristi's and I'll pick you up tomorrow at 8. - Did Sergiu explain? - Explain what? - What "what"? - I have to read for you, right? - Did he give you the envelope? - Yes. - I'll just read the papers to you. - No, I'll take care of everything! Don't read stuff for me in front of them! Fine. Why do you want to go to Bucharest? To be away from all the idiots here. - Tase, my good man! - Hello! - How are you? - All good. Cheers. - Doing well? - Yes. - See you on Sunday? - You bet! - In the morning. - Yes. So? Twin girls or boys? One girl, one boy. Lovely. And she's due in three months? Yes. Only she won't do it. Tell your brother she said no. - You asked her? - Yes. She wants to raise twins with her husband away in Spain? - Italy. - Even worse! Let's talk some more on Sunday. I'll bring my brother and sister- in-law, or you can come over. She said no. Twins or no twins, she won't give one away. Is that why you haven't come for that chainsaw? No. But if you don't mind lending it to me... Of course not. Take care. - Have a good day. - Bye! Mind the back of the car. - Drive safely! - Yeah. Now you don't even say hello? At least we "idiots" have manners. I should slap that phone out of your hands. The man is 80! Hey, you got... Irina, wait! Get back here! - Where's that envelope? - What envelope? The one for the providers! With all the amounts and markdowns! - A big envelope! - No idea. - Didn't Sergiu give it to you? - Yes, I put it in the car. He said you know the amounts. F*ck. It was in the glove compartment! Right on top of the agenda! It was your responsibility! Viki never caused trouble. You can read, it was your responsibility! I only handle the money and the agenda. The numbers in the agenda should match anyway. Go in, I'll talk to Sergiu. Put that shit down, you're always glued to it. - Bring some hot peppers. - Sure. You think the world is in there? What do you do with it all day? I asked you a question. Writing e-mails for your businesses. You look at pictures all day. Taking photos of the sky so you can claim you're at the seaside. Don't get run over and come back all bruised. Am I right? It wouldn't be the first time. Be glad I don't whack you. So, is your sister seeing someone? No. - Don't you mean you don't know? - I don't know. Give me that! What's in your head? You think reality's in there? Get the f*ck outside. Breathe some air. Touch a tree! Your generation will end up smelling flowers over the phone! Hello. I'm downstairs, eating. What do you mean? I just don't have it, Sergiu. I didn't leave it anywhere! Maybe it fell somewhere. Yes. Sure I'll go. Right now. Listen. Did you have the envelope on you? - They found it at the factory. - No. Go to the kitchen. Ask for your second course to go. None for me. Get moving! I'll be in the car. So you're not coming back up tonight? - Are you going to a party? - I don't know. Be ready tomorrow at 8! Sorana! There's someone at the door! - Where were you? - Sleeping. Mum and Dad will be here at 10.30. Did you find that paper I asked you to look for? Still not? Listen, who slept in there with me last night? I don't know, why? I don't know who it was. - Sorana! - In a moment! You went in there with Tudor. Who's Tudor? - Yes, what? - Where did I put that? That what? Don't worry, I'll put it in the laundry. And you, shoo. Both of them 1.60 metres? Tomorrow, if you can make it there with the owner. Yes. Tomorrow at 10, yes. Have a good day. But you wanted to sleep with him, right? I blacked out. - Before or after? - Not sure, it's all fuzzy. Can I shower at your place? - Got a charger? - Try the upper drawer there. Pass it to me, there's no outlet there. Care to talk? I told you, I... If you're so sure the guy is OK, why not call him and meet? Ask if he used a condom, what's the big deal? Please find out who you've been with. - Irina. - I know who it was! You said you'd make that call. If you don't know where you're flying to, no wind will help. - Not my fault you flew wrong. - This guy is dodgy. You said you'd call that professor in Bucharest! I'll take care of that today, just talk to that guy. Have a seat, please. Excuse the mess. - I said we should have met in town. - I'm in a hurry. OK. Right. Yeah, so... - Sorana's brother called and... - This is awkward. No, it's good that you've come. We should talk about it, get to know each other. I find interesting that... Anyway... I had no idea you were a virgin. - I wasn't. - You looked so grown-up. I just want to know if you used a condom. Frankly, I can't remember the details. I was a bit... ...dazed and so were you. I can't remember a thing. I was sleeping. No you weren't, I wouldn't have done anything if... So you weren't that drunk. Where are you from? Bucharest. I didn't finish, if it helps. Yeah, it's all... Maybe I made a mistake. I don't want it to sound like I'm dodging responsibility, but... The way you spoke and... You seemed to know your way around. And you were so beautiful inside... Outside too, of course. I really didn't know you were a virgin. You seemed so grown-up. How old are you? 22. OK, then... It doesn't matter, of course. So... I was wrong, now what do I do? - Want me to talk to your parents? - Piss off. - OK. - I was sleeping. Sorana's brother told me about the blood stain and... I told you I wasn't a virgin. You have children? Yes. A wife, too? Yes. Irina... - I'm sorry, I was high and drunk... - Did you enjoy it? - Let's not. - Please tell me. I don't know, I don't remember much. Why did you leave in the morning? I had a rehearsal. Did you leave thinking you enjoyed it or...? Irina... It was a one-night thing. Did I enjoy it? No idea. Yes, I suppose you did. I don't know. I just have these flashes, I don't remember much. I'm sorry. Could you kiss me? No. - Am I ugly? - No, you're... On the contrary, you're beautiful, but... Beautiful as a woman or... Well... More like a student. Do you find me attractive as a woman? Are you suggesting I like students? - What you said... - Let me explain. I'm genuinely sorry. I know you can't understand how sorry I am. Anyway, I'll help you in any way you want. But don't blackmail me. Don't ask me to kiss you again, it's lame. - And if you really were asleep... - The truth is... Something about last night was really good. There was nothing good about last night. I want you to kiss me. What's up? Did you talk? What happened? Did he remember? Hey! Hey, wait! Mexico is really diverse. The touristy part is all luxury and stuff... ...and the rest is poor. Isn't that... The mountain hick who can't read? - His brother is that hotel guy. - A genius in the sticks! - Alex... - Don't "Alex" me. As far as shady deals go, they're brilliant. They deforested two mountains, built that eyesore of a hotel... - Alex! - It's why he quit school. Hick incoming! Hey, runt! Hi. - Didn't you see me? - I thought you'd call ahead. - Smoking, huh? - Yes. Nice. Friends of yours? - Hello. - Hi. He's my... neighbour. Aren't we going? - Have you paid? - No. Sorry. That will be 15. - Bye. - Bye. A neighbour? Wasn't that her cousin? Yes, he's her cousin. F*ck! You're too smart to have me as your cousin? F*cking piece of sh*t! Say what? Why are you running? Where do... Any idea how... F*ck this! Forget about Bucharest! One word about university and I'll bash your f*cking head in! There's work to do here, f*ck it! - What's that on your neck? - What? Get it off! What is it? - It's blood. - F*ck! - Any left? - No. I don't want it. When Mum got her degree in petroleum engineering and went on to get a job, she was so smart she could have... She had the best grades and everything. She should have been a boss. You know what her sh*thead employer said? "If there's a fire at the oil well, I can piss on it and put it out and you can't." Get what I mean? You think acting all smart will get you anywhere? Use that brain of yours here, for the family! Are we going to the trout farm next? - Where's your mother? - At the hotel, with Cristi. Tomorrow you're going with Liviu again. Make up with him, he's your cousin. The thing at the pond happened 15 years ago. - Auntie, anything from the garden? - No, love. You jumped in after that girl and almost drowned. Of course Liviu got scared and dragged you out a bit roughly. He just slapped you around a bit. Move it, runts! I'm talking to you! And you lot only think about running away to Bucharest. Seriously now! I'll get some more! And all those foreign countries... even worse than Bucharest. The market isn't in your phones, it's where they sell food. What's an intellectual anyway? You don't even know. - Mum, give it a break! - You stick to your papers. That's why Liviu and you keep fighting. - How is that relevant? - It is! At 14, he wanted to show you the sea of clouds and you, a squirt, called him a retard because he couldn't read. We had just withdrawn him from school because of his dyslexia. That's why that time, at the pond... - Yes? - Where have you been? - Inside. - Weren't you at the hotel? I was inside. Back then, at the pond, he just wanted to save you. And he's such a hard worker, too. Besides, book smarts won't help if you vote for all the idiots. Viki, hurry, they're waiting! - Irina! - Yes! - Look how tiny! - Take it back, Uncle. I'll be right there, Dad! We need to add some heating, maybe ventilation too. They need warmth in the first two weeks. The window lets in light, but also the cold. They need fresh air, too. If I leave the window ajar overnight, anything could get in. I wanted Cristi's help, but he's busy. - You like it? - Yes, so tiny. You or Cristi could help me with them. If you stay here, we can develop some more. It's so quiet here. Will you tell him? "Cousin, your dad wants help with the chickens." - "I'll handle your accounting." - Uncle! Irina, don't you feel sorry for this little ball of fluff? Why move away when you have these beauties running around? Tell Cristi I want to build an enclosure with artificial lighting. He won't listen to me. Don't know why you're all in such a hurry to leave this place. Dad, is this the right kind? - Yes. - I'm a total pro! Have you made that call? First I'd need to know what you want to study. What do you want? To see the campus? - To leave here as soon as possible. - I don't know if you can. - Have you asked? - No. - Why not? - Because I know it's not possible. Help me get to Bucharest. I'll ask him to help with the application. Now, when all the tourists are coming? There's work to do, Irina. You can't. What do you even want to do? You want to run away? That's complete nonsense. Why run? - Talk to them. - I want out! Stop it! This is your family, after all. - Not this year. - When, then? Maybe in a year or two. What are you doing with that? It won't survive below 30 degrees. About Liviu's talks with the providers... The payments don't add up. So? Stick to your own job, I'll handle the paperwork. Whatever. Go help your dad install AC for the chickens. Sorry about this. Your flatmate let me in. I remembered we talked that night. You said in Acting School you study character psychology. Yes, Michael Chekhov. That thing about relating to your co-actors. The whole 3D-geometry thing. Yes, I told you when it comes to math, or to numbers, only geometry brings things together coherently. You're too young, Irina. This can't work. I don't want any emotional ties. We're on our way to the providers. Yes, Sergiu, I got it! I have the documents in the glove compartment. - You paid them how much? - The sum in the envelope. You gave it to...? - A guy. - His name? - I didn't ask. - Why not? - I didn't think to. - Why not? - I thought you were in a hurry. - So you accepted any invoice? I knew you wanted the delivery on time. Do you think before you speak? Listen. Two storeys, 20 bathrooms each, 3 square metres each. Then a third storey. Meaning? How much? - But the warehouse only... - How much? Irina! How much is that? - How much per square metre? - 30. For three stories? - 5,400. - Right. The invoice says the same. And if we add the other amounts? Still 5,400, Liviu? Go back and talk to them like someone who has a brain. Have the invoice canceled. It's 6 p.m, they're already closed. - The runt hasn't eaten since lunch. - Why not? - We've been running around! - So run some more. - Didn't you see that invoice? - You told me not to check. Here. It has all the stuff in it, you just need to... I know. Is this the guy's name? See how much we need you? So, your sister's boyfriend. Is he from Bucharest? Dinu, pal, hello. Can you please call the guy with the tiles? Yeah... What? Stupid f*cker! Not you, sorry. There's been a problem, Sergiu wants it fixed now. Yes, about him. That guy's the guard, what does he know? Isn't he your friend? Please! It's not that late. - 9,200. - Say again? Yes? It's just over 6 p.m, he only left about an hour ago. I spoke with him at 4 p.m. What the... What is this, Irina? Where did the blood come from? - Who's there? - Look around, is it from you? - This is Ursu. - Ursu who? Ursus arctos! Liviu Ursu! - Everyone's gone home! - Is it from you? Open up, I have business with your boss. Everyone's left. I talked to your boss, he's on his way here! Pass me some tissues. - Are you hurt? - No. I'm fine. Look again, maybe your neck? Where... Why not bring him to meet us? Who is he? What does he do? Why is your sister with a Jew and so on? I'm hungry and tired. Don't give me the silent treatment. Gabi's cooked stuffed cabbage. Again? All to impress her husband, since he's come take her back. It's too fatty. Yes, you shouldn't combine carbs with protein and veggies. - Really? - Really. Like Jews and Christians! Watch it, or you'll eat cabbage through a straw! Why are you two keeping secrets? Bring the boy home to meet us. Why won't she introduce him? Bring him home. Don't be such freaks! Hello. I got it, yes. Pass me that invoice. I don't need her to read it to me. Yes, Sergiu, I'll clean up my own mess. I told you I'd fix it! The guy is here, I need to go. Bye. - Give it here! - Need help? Can it. Hello. Ouch! What are you doing? What do you think you're doing? Are you staying over? Your wife is hot. - Stop it. - What's her name? How's school? Do you live together in Bucharest? - Enjoying university? - Monica? - Ioana? - Not enjoying university? I'm not in university. - I signed up for a course. - Any good? Why, you only f*ck honour students? Really? You went to Olympiads and all that? Yes, I even qualified for the nationals. But they were in summer, when we get lots of tourists. And it was too hot? Bite me. - Why? - What? Why should I bite you? What's bothering you? Irina! - I just want to go. - Why, what happened? - Irina! - I feel... Feel what? What got you upset? - I feel so ridiculous. - Why ridiculous? Because you feel something? - Because you want pain? - Don't say it. What now? Irina! Irina, are you alright? Want some water? Lie down. Leave that. Come over here! About your guy... What guy? Who is he, what does he do? There's no guy, idiot! Viki! There's several. Don't say that, people will hear! - What do you mean, several? - No-one in particular. - Since when do you hide from me? - I'm not, piss off. Got the marriage bug? - I'll pay for the wedding! - Sod off. - Found Sergiu a baby yet? - Shut the f*ck up! Please, don't ever ask that again. There. Let's hear about your guy. Fine, there is someone, but don't tell. - Does your sister know? - Of course. Why the f*ck didn't you tell me? Let go! What's with all the secrets, you two? - Don't act up with me! - Suck one! Since when do we keep secrets? Are you too embarrassed to tell me? Tell me, what does he do? Come on, I'm curious. - I'll find out anyway. - Go ahead. F*cking... Is he a Jew? Liviu, if you butt in... You'll do what? - Bring him here! - You got the wrong guy! - But get him christened first! - He's not a Jew! - So Rumour Radio was wrong? - Having fun? This kid... Any word from that woman in the village? I talked to the priest. Liviu, don't let the whole village know. That's why I spoke with the priest. Little bro, your slip-ups cost me 4,600 this month. Got too much on your mind? No, I just... I thought the Father was more convincing. Who keeps letting them out? - I'll go. - Stay here. The priest is here, put that out. Where's the cutlery, airheads? Don't stare at me! - Father, what will you drink? - Your best. I can drive Oana to Bucharest next week. Thank you, but we're sending her with our neighbours. They're driving their son to university. A charming, smart boy, a future engineer. - Thank you for yesterday. - Don't mention it. Please, there's no need! - So? - Patience, son. Miracles might happen yet. The test results were clear. Maybe it's her? No, he can't have children. Old man Tase said his granddaughter is against it. She could be convinced, she has three children already. Twins are no picnic, and a fourth son... She's an obedient girl and her husband... - He's off working in Spain. - Yes, and he's against it. - Did you talk to him? - No, her. Liviu, her husband won't give any child away. He's a devout Christian. It's all God's will, whether we like it or not. Sergiu's time will come, with patience. You might be searching in the wrong place. Mădă, who is Viki seeing? - I don't know. - Really? Isn't it that smart Jew from Sinaia? No idea. - Tell me! - The blonde from the hotel? - Yes. Albert, right? - No. - What's his name, then? - I don't know. Viki, get over here. I'm busy. - How's the "deceased"? - Who, my dad? Viki, come! Mariana, sucker of the Ursu Clan, do you take Iura the Deceased to be your lawful wedded husband? Viki, get back here! Guess who it is! The deceased's daughter! - I said come! - There's blood on your neck. Get your sister or I'll beat her up! Can you read my lips? F*ck you! - Stop it! - Stay out of this! She thinks she's too smart for us! Liviu, please! - What's the guy's name? - Lay off her! Let go! - Are you pregnant? - Are you drunk? - What's this, the Middle Ages? - Shut it! It's OK if you're pregnant, just tell me! - F*ck off, idiot! - Viki! We're so sorry, Father. Father, all women in our family are virgins. That's why Sergiu doesn't have any children! You're such an idiot! Stop it, what got into all of you? Leni, pipe down. We apologise, Father. Young blood is so fiery. - Liviu, sit down. - This has never happened before. Do eat, Father, it's a pity to let the cabbage soup go cold. There now, Liviu, sit down. Sit down and eat with us. Trust me, it's delicious. Calm down, please. Some water? What? What are you doing, kid? You tell me what to do, then. See, how am I supposed to take you seriously? First of all, don't try to imitate what you see on TV. - Do you really feel like that? - Meaning? It just feels like you're trying too hard to do it right. What do you like about it? About what? Oral sex. Did I get the wrong idea? I don't know. What am I supposed to do, then? Whatever you feel like doing. Bite me. Pass me a cigarette. Please. How many partners have you had? Two, but we didn't really do much. Two? - Oh man. - What? Nothing. Did I scare you? No, I just don't get you. Come here. I don't get why you're scared of your violent impulses. - Ever read Morris' The Naked Ape? - No. What's the boo-boo? Tell me about Bucharest. Bucharest! Bucharest, the land of endless possibilities! I mean it. Will you help or not? Help how? Moving there, I guess. Sure, I'll ask my wife if you can share the bedroom. What was that about? Irina, what was that? I'm sorry, I can't help. Not about what you feel, not about Bucharest. At most, I can carry your luggage to the station. And if Bucharest is why you're here... You're in hot water. You got your geometry all wrong. So. This is what we're going to do. Mess with the envelopes one more time and... Tell me. Is Viki pregnant or not? Fine. You will tell me how to find your sister's wanker. I'll be in the car. - What's up, chickie? - All good. - Meeting your guy tonight? - No. I know you won't. Viki. Viki, don't go overboard! I only twisted his arm! He didn't even fight like a man! Victoria! Cool off, he's fine! Who'd let you raise a child, you piece of shit? Victoria! Come eat something. Come apologise to Sergiu, let's make up. You have 4,200 in here. Let's go, sis! - Love you. - Love you too. We'll call you on that number. Full moon, full moon, Bring me happiness soon, Make me rich like a tycoon, Make me bright like the sun in June, Full moon, full moon! - There's a full moon! - Come back in. Look, the moon! Lovely. - Come back in. - Don't want to. You fell from this balcony when you were three. Is that car coming or going? - It really is lovely. - Yes. Come back in. OK. - What are you doing here? - Going to the loo. So go. Why are you locking it? Think I'll follow you in? Irina! Irina! Irina! Viki? Viki! What do you want? Tudor, do you know this guy? - Viki? - Viki who? Where is Victoria? Gone abroad, to have two children. With whom? A foreigner. Who will give her two babies. Why do you and your sister always talk shit like that? Did we keep you here by force? Besides, I don't get it. Why run? Instead of just leaving? Go ahead, leave! You're free to go. You always have been. You know what the problem is? You're too ashamed to ask out. You know you'd be a coward to leave us with all this work. It's hard work. That's why you all leave. That's why you go pop out babies abroad. Because it's hard work here. But what do I know? You're more educated. Go away. Go. I swear no one will stop you. Irina, come out! You psychopath! I'll kill you! Why did you send me after that guy? Are you crazy? - Go to Bucharest, you're free now! - Irina, calm down! What the f*ck do you want, retard? She messed with our papers! - Irina, come here! - Go f*ck yourself! - Why? - Why? After you... You beat the hell out of me! - What is she saying? - You beat the hell out of me! At the pond. You call that taking care of me? You'd rather have drowned? You should have hugged me, not beat me! I was just 7! It's how we've been taught! You called me a retard! What's she saying? Stop saying that! Irina, you really believe all that? Irina, I didn't mean to! She's sick in the head, you'll see! Cristi, son, what are you doing? You're all crazy! You'll embarrass us all! Cristi! Cristi! Lunatics, you and your whole generation! Go change the system! Don't ever come back!
