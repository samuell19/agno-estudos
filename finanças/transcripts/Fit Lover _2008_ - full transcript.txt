Hello? -lt's Me Who's this? -lt's your mother! Why aren't you out of bed yet? l've told you a million times already you're 30 years old. l'm 29! You were in my womb for a year, So as far as l'm concerned you're 30. l think l've been nagged enough for one day! l'm warning you : After you're 30 it's hard to find a husband, After you're married it's hard to get pregnant. After you're pregnant it's hard to give birth. God And even if you do give birth its tough to guarantee it's not a freak. Have you finished yet? My advice to you is: get up early and go to bed early, get married early and have kids early. don't dilly dally your life away OK, l know. lt's so dry! Sweetie... Uh. Daddy got you a birthday gift. Don't max it out all at once. Who care's, you're paying! Sweetie... Daddy invited a friend today. l know. New girlfriend, right? Hey, Lao Nie! Ah, there you are! Let me introduce you This is my daughter, Siu Bing lt's...it's you? You? You two know each other? We were in the same class at school. Why didn't you tell me who your daughter is? Well...this is even better! Come on sit down, take a seat! Let's order, sweetie. Oh, l'm in a bit of a hurry. Call me, ok? Enjoy your meal. Sweetie... Ooops! Old Chiu What a surprise! Lao Nie! Fancy seeing you here! Oh! Xueqing's going out with you? l've asked her out a million times. On the way here l was wondering to myself why she suddenly said she wanted to hook up. You want to use a substitute to ditch me! You two know each other? We're war buddies. Dad,enjoy your meal. You must have lots to discuss! Dad? That's your daughter? Why do you think she called me "dad"? Oh! Oh! Put your hands together! What? Upside down? Oh, thanks After six years and a marathon love affair they finally decided to tie the knot, But on the day of the wedding the bride vanished at the last moment she chose to run! One week after her mysterious disappearance we finally "caught up" with the missing bride. Well...he's not bad and it's because he's not bad, that l could see the rest of our lives all planned out for us, everything. ln our seventies and eighties we'd be exactly the same as we are now. Stuck in the same routine day after day, year after year. Life would be all planned out. lt would be like knowing the end of the story before reading it. No surprises, no hope, lt was terrifying. Nie Bing! Nie Bing! You're on! Camera two. Look at the teleprompt! Romance is nothing but a shimmering rainbow, only marriage is the key to everlasting love. Congratulations! Thank you! Thank you! l gave up my dignity, lost my poise, abandoned my principals And it's all because l can't forget you. l want to give you a birthday gift. Open the small one first. This bronze was created by Rodin in his late years. "The Old Courtesan" was once an eminent beauty, a woman do die for. Look now upon the ashes of her youth, The pain is all but tangible. Age knows no mercy. Please accept this gift as a kind reminder: You may choose to reject me but you should never reject your youth. What's wrong with you this time? l dumped him! You weren't even going out. How could you dump him? Well l did. What do you think l should do? Cry my eyes out or go drinking? Cry your eyes out. Costs less and does less damage to your health. Hey. What's wrong now? l can't cry. That's because he's not worth it. Guys that are worth crying for don't make girls cry. Just think real hard. Try to think of something that really upset you. Come on. Telephone! Jesus lt's nonsense. Crying is hard work. Ah! What's wrong? We can go for that drink now. What on earth do you think you're doing? Two shakes is more than enough. Are you trying to give me a headache? Still can't cry? Who are you? Oh, me? l'm Angel the angel. an immortal, like Cupid, Superman : we're in the same line of work. An angel from Shandong, huh? Sorry about the accent, lt's a bit like learning a foreign language My Mandarin teacher was really bad... Anyway, what can l do for you? What can you do for me? Security! Still not convinced? lf you really want me to believe in you, walk through that pane of glass over there. Fine. No problem. Let me show you something a little trickier. Don't blink! And... Hey Waitress! What's that girl drinking? She looks so high! fetch me a glass too. Where did you go? What! You dozed off. l didn't manage to cry and l got harassed by this total freak. Can't you drive? A gift from me! For me? This car will bring you 12 suitors, so there should be at least one that suits you. But remember: lt will only work until your 30th birthday. You have one year. How will l find my prince charming? That's a question only you can answer. Remember: indicate left and turn right. Good Luck! Hey! You must be a total nutcase. When l talk to you, you ignore me. Now l have to leave and you want me to stay. Do you think it's easy coming down here? l've got to get myself a bite to eat. Hey, l remember now. There's a good spot around here somewhere. lt's called Kaifeng Cuisine, something like that. Kaifeng Cuisine? You know, the ad with the old man with white hair. KFC...something like that. Oh. Bye bye! See you later! Ma'am, you can't park your car here. lf l told you l was sent by an angel, would you believe me? l'm warning you Our conversation is being recorded. l really was sent here by an angel! Beat her! Fine her Fine her! Cheat! Liar! Fine her! She's a liar! lf you fail to adhere to traffic regulations and to drive safely l will have no choice but to fine you. Now move it! Yeah! Hey! What's taking you so long? Take your fine and drive on. You're holding up the cue. People line up to get fined? Don't you know? We're all his adoring fans. For 100 RMB he gives you a salute and an autograph. lt's worth it! That's the advantage of being rich. Without money all you can do is stand on the curb shouting. You don't get a thing. Fine her! Fine her! Cheat! Liar! Miss,have i seen you somewhere before? Oh, you're that TV host, Nie Bing! Hello, my name is Tan Xin Are you an insurance salesman? No! l provide people with insurance related services. ls there a difference? Of course there's a difference. lt's just like the gospel You can't "buy" the gospel, because it's priceless The Lord almighty is not for sale. lnsurance is crucial to a lifetime of happiness, and happiness is something that can't be bought. So what's God got to do with insurance? lnsurance takes care of you while you're alive, and God takes care of the rest. So if you're not alive, then you're dead. Could we talk about something else? OK, l'll tell you what you want to hear. How do you know what l want to hear? When l was training in the USA The first thing l learnt was how to use 100 different phrases to make a lady happy. Oh? They have courses like that? OK, give it your best shot. l don't even have to look at you l can tell by your fingers And your long hair That you're the type of girl that exists only in Korean video game with a sexy figure Continue Your skin is supernaturally clear Soft and silky smooth. Even when you're tanned lt has a natural luster likened to pearls Uh-huh. The way you wear your broach naturally makes you the center of attention. Your long hair compliments your high heel shoes, creating a beautiful curve Your earrings together with your necklace form the shape of an upside down pyramid. You are the essence of style! Wait a second, let me finish laughing! This is just something l threw this on, l didn't even think about the style. OK, wait a minute. Can l get the bill please? l've got it covered. You should allow the lady to pay. Her credit card will accumulate double the points. Thank you. So, besides flattery what else can you do? lf you give me a year l'll give you 365 different types of pleasure. And each will Cost you less than 100 RMB. A journey of 1000 miles starts with the first step My love is by your side every step of the way l envy you, Panda! l've been asked to brief everyone on the TV stations policy. everyone will pay attention at their work to work as a team for the good of the show. Nie Bing. l know today isn't a holiday But sending you flowers doesn't need excuses. l went to your hometown to experience your childhood This is me on the carousel you rode eating your favorite toffee hawthorn berries! Someone asked for me? Miss, your lunch has arrived. l didn't order anything. Your friend downstairs ordered it for you. Oh. Your mother told me freshwater shrimps are your favorite. l bought these for you in the suburbs. Hope you like my cooking! You're so good to me What can l do in return? You don't need to do a thing. When l was training in the USA they taught us a theory: Every normal person has approximately 50 useful contacts However, a big star like you must have at least 500 high profile contacts lf each of your friends has 50 useful contacts then that's a total of 25000 people lf each person buys 200 RMB insurance per year Then that makes a total of 5,000,000 RMB l thought you said you didn't sell insurance l don't, but l can provide 5,000,000 RMB worth of insurance services. So that's why you've been so nice to me. When are you going to ask me to sign on the dotted line? You misunderstand me. This is my resignation. l have decided that from now on when l am with you l will never utter the word "insurance". Hello? Tsui Lang Oh? Lunch? OK. OK, call me back later. Bye! Who was that? Tsui Lang Tsui Lang? l love his films! Really? oh Well in that case Hi! Nie Bing! Hi Tsui Lang what happened to you? l fell off a horse when l was filming. l told you presenting TV is easier then film. l have to take a call. Tsui Lang, Tan Xin Tan Xin, Tsui Lang You can get acquainted. Hi! Hi! Hi! Excuse me, Could l have your autograph please? Thank you. Could we take a photo together? Sorry not today, l'm injured. Ok, thanks. -Bye You know l'm a great admirer of your films. Thank you. What are you been shooting now? Huang Feihong They're shooting it again? This is the 8th episode. Episode number 8! You're playing Huang Feihong? l'm playing Porky Rong. Porky Rong, huh? Porky Rong is cool. He's my favorite character. Showbiz may look glitzy But it isn't as cushy as it seems No fixed accommodation, no fixed hours, We get up before the rooster crows, go to bed after the bogeyman is tucked in for the night, work harder then oxen and eat worse than pigs Have you ever tasted the food film crews eat? Do you know what wire-fu is? The worst thing is you have no dignity! Whatever the director tells you to do, you do it. He wants you to jump off a building, you jump. He wants you to stand in the rain and soak, you soak. He wants you to strip, you strip. Sometimes we don't even get stunt doubles. Look at my hand. l told her l fell off a horse. The truth is l was bitten by a dog. Look at my eye. What's wrong? -lt's fake! Look at my teeth? They're fake too? They're real, but they've been knocked about so much they look fake Sounds tough! but my work isn't exactly a walk in the park either. We wear suits and look elegant but we live with our tails between our legs We have assessments every week, it drives us insane. We don't get to see our loved ones for the holidays. You're a model? No, l'm an insurance salesman You sell insurance? Yes. You really sell insurance? Yes. And you're Nie Bings' friend? Yes. Buddy! Careful. lt's a shame l didn't meet you earlier! l've always needed a friend that works in insurance. OK, got it! l'll tell him again. No, sorry, but l can't accept right away. The insurance film crews buy for us is lousy l have to buy some coverage from you today. l can introduce you to someone No! l don't want you to introduce anyone else. You're Nie Bings' friend right? And you sell insurance. This is fate! You see l There are people more responsible than l am l can introduce you to them. No. l don't want anyone else. You're my pal so l want to buy directly from you! You know Fake insurance peddlers have caused me a lot of harm in the past. Tell me your cell phone number. your phone number Leave me your digits. Oh l'm not the only person in this business that wants to buy insurance. Yesterday Fan Bing Bing called and asked me about it. OK, fine. Bye l've got the phone numbers of over 600 super stars. All of them need insurance. Quick! This is Fan Bing Bings' number What are you doing? Leaving a telephone number. Why? to sell insurance. 54341 You've been using me to sell insurance! No! Just look at him, he's a wreck. Don't you think you're a little late? Nie Bing! Juliet, l've been waiting for you! Juliet? Are you supposed to be Romeo? lt's me. Oh Juliet! What are you doing here? What am l doing? l can do what ever you want, miss. lt depends entirely on what you're looking for. Don't go! l'm a professional talent show contestant. l've been on "Super Boy" ; "Good Boy" "Real Boy" ; "Dream Boy" ; "Dance Boy" ; "Super Star" ; "Stars in their Eyes" "The X Factor" ; "Dancing with Stars" ; "Soul Train" ; "Pop ldol" "Nouvelle Star" lf it's a talent show, l go! l may look a little wet behind the ears But l've acted in over 30 TV series. ln "Three Kingdoms" l acted three parts all by myself Which three? First Liu Bei and l went to war with Cao Cao Then Cao Cao and l went to war with Dong Wu And after that As soon as the assistant director shouted "action" We'd all sprint towards the camera. Experience matters in showbiz Newbie extras haven't got a clue. They run until they're blue in the face and not a single close up. Experience doesn't come cheap. l've paid my dues. lt is difficult for girls to get a role in a film, the same to guys. l spent 1000 RMB inviting the assistant director out for a meal All l got in return was one line. Want to your name in lights? Go to the director. Want to get noticed? Stand close to the camera. Finally l had a startling revelation : Getting the director in your pocket isn't enough You have to get friendly with the cameramen You know Ma Dagang? l know Great director! l was in his award winning film "Assault" l was that close to the camera l went to the cinema to watch the film but l couldn't find my shot! Finally l understood : l forgot to make friends with the pryotechnicians. There were too many explosions to see anything. Oh -Acting is a mysterious art. Later on l realized : the swiftest way to stardom is talent shows. l participated in "the dream of the red chamber" more than once. l went to all of the admission districts They said l was too old to play Baoyu, and too young to play Jiazheng. When l told them my age they said l could play Wang Xifeng For crying out loud, Wang Xifeng is a woman! So was Mei Lan Fang. What's on your agenda today? They're shooting a sequel to "Call For Love" lt's a story with one woman and twelve men. This film is a golden opportunity. The female lead is Karena Lam, i love her! Ah! What are you doing? l'm in a hurry to get changed. and l need to get warmed up Where's the sunroof? 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 Ah! my mountain dwelling friends! Distinguished officials, honored guests, members of the panel of judges, my name is Ying Kwok and l'm here to show you a good time! l feel dizzy. Wow! The Olympics are finally here. They've installed a horizontal bar on the road! That isn't a horizontal bar, it's a height limit. Ah! lf they choose me l'll recommend you to the director. Ah! Ah! What a nutcase All the world's a stage and all the men and women merely players. That player was supposed to be one of my 12 men? He may be beyond help, but he's got great potential This is a real primary share! How dare you overtake me! Where do you think you're going! Oh my god. Hey! You think you're the only person that owns a car? l used to drive a Hummer. One wheel was worth more than your whole car. -i'm sorry,i dont mean it! -You're a famous TV presenter! l suppose so. That settles it then. Sign me an autograph. An autograph? OK. Thanks Hello. What are you doing? Give me a lift, quick! Why,you can't go running around in the state you're in! Don't move, Sir Don't move. Get away from me. lf you come any closer, l'll jump! Please calm down, miss. Get back! l'm here! Get back! Get back! l'm here! Get back! you don't go there Careful! Don't try to talk me out of it. This time l've made up my mind. Lady l'm not here to talk you out of anything l'll jump with you You've had a loss too? How much? Pretty much everything. We're all in the same boat. This is a good spot you've chosen. Of course This is my final choice. l may have chosen badly on the stock market but this time you made the right choice. Exactly! The last time l jumped l chose very poorly. Ended up shattering my bones but l didn't die. Have you chosen which position you plan to use? There are positions? Of course, it's an art! The first is the head first dive. That's the most deadly way to fall. but it doesn't leave a pretty sight. Let's not wait Let's just jump and plummet like the stock market! Come on! Let's jump Let's do it! l think we need to talk. Talk? About what? C'mon lets jump! l don't want to die! Oh well, if you don't want to die then scram. Get back! Get Back! l know him, let me past. Your foot is fine. Nonsense! My leg hurts,my foot hurts, my whole body aches! Don't even think about badgering me to leave. Mr. Cheung is a hero. There must be something you can do to cure him. Hey! How are you feeling today? Much better, now that you're here that is. l have a friend who is a distinguished surgeon. l'll give him a call. He'll come and examine you in a few days. There's no need to make a fuss. lnjured ligaments take at least 100 days to heal. l'll just take it easy. Here you go. Let me take a look. Oh, he's fine. lf he's fine then why is he still in hospital. lt's been two weeks already. Why is it that you'll believe everyone but you won't trust me? Don't try to change the subject. OK, l'll help you cure him. l will make him stand! Hey! Hi there! Who are you? This is the friend l told you about, the famous orthopediatrician is here to see you. So your leg hurts, huh? Feel anything? Let me see Feel anything? Can you feel this? Still not feeling anything? OK. l'm going to need a different tool. Relax, it'll be fine. You! Told you so. OK l admit it. My leg has been fine for a while now Nie Bing, let me explain! Don't you think your prank was childish? lt was childish. Are you brave enough to come and see my patients? Patients? Dance! All the boats sink Takes me to the brink! Let me introduce myself l'm a psychiatrist l specialize in treating patients who are bi-polar -- manic depressive Bi-polar disorder cannot be healed. lts symptoms however, can be controlled. lf symptoms are not controlled, patients may become suicidal l am the creator of stock market therapy Stock market therapy? Correct! Fighting fire with fire! l told them to buy stocks and shares They all became so obsessed with the stock market that their bi-polar symptoms vanished as if by magic. You're a genius ln it's initial stages it was a wonder cure Not only did the symptoms of bi-polar disorder disappear, it also made them incredibly wealthy. They all said they liked my sisters' name Rose Whatever stocks l told them to buy just "rose"! As time past more people came to ask me about stocks and shares So it seemed a natural choice to switch jobs and become a stockbroker. l made a lot of money on the stock market. l bought a car, bought a house and l was just about ready to marry my fiancee, Ms. Guan. The market was real bullish back then... Later on Beware! Beware! Of the blue chip share! Later on... later on Ms. Guan left me Why? Why? That's what l'd like to know! Anyway... Later on my sister started crying and the markets plummeted. What has that got to do with the stock market? Same as before: l call my sister sis Cry--Sis Crisis Black Monday pounced! The dead cat didn't bounce! Now my patients are all back again. their symptoms have gotten worse than ever. Now l can't really tell who's sick, them or me...

Calm down, calm down. l just made a tiny little mistake, that's all. You see l knew that something was wrong. l've got a blocked nose, but l still came down to help. l... l didn't mean for you to be the spare tire. Listen to me. ln my records it said he was single. Everything changes so fast. lt's just like the stock market. You know, when i'm up in heaven l often make bets with the god of gambling Cut the crap. Did that count as one of my suitors?

The manager can only sell jewelry, but the boss can wear whatever she likes. Enough talk, this is for you too. lt may not be the height of fashion But it was left to me by my great great great great great grandmother -l can't accept it. -l'm entrusting it to you to give to our next generation. This too...is yours. Buy whatever you want. Spend as much as you like. Do you want to know how much money it is? l want to know how old you are. ls that all? Not exactly. Come on,stand in line.

Just like mice love rice it's true! Time to make an impression. Leave a little space for me. 1, 2, 3 lsn't it romantic? Silently you took your leave as silently you came You waved goodbye and after that were never seen again. Do you understand what l'm trying to tell you? Yes. l'm chasing you with cupid's arrows And you're flying about in a bulletproof vest So stop being so nice to me l'm not attracted to you. That's all right, just give it time. But we don't have any foundations. Roses are red. Violets are blue. l'm stinking rich. You're too good to be true! There. That's our foundations. l'm too good to be true? l love you because you aren't interested in my money Really? l thought you'd be interested in my wage. But you were more interested in my age. You shouldn't waste your time on me. But l've been waiting for you all my life. You're one in a million. l want a knight in shining armour. Oh, yes Oh that's a shame everyone calls me the black fatty. The court has decided To issue a restraining order Ms. Nie! Ms. Nie! You want to know the truth? OK, OK. l will tell you : Once upon a time there was a mountain On the mountain there was a temple ln the temple lived an old monk and a young monk The young monk asked the old monk what the truth was. The old monk replied : Once upon a time there was a mountain On the mountain there was a temple Do you get the picture? Ms. Nie! Ms. Nie! One final question! Ms. Nie, could you make a statement? Ms.Nie,could you say something for the press? OK, that's enough, thank you. That's all for today, thank you. One last question! We still have a question! Oh! Ms. Nie Good Choice. l agree! Over there. Look in the direction you want the ball to go and swing. Oh. l keep missing. Could you help me choose? OK This one. Will they suit me? Of course. OK, l'll try them on. Ah! Do you think this suits me? Hmmm. l'll take all three items. But the lady hasn't tried them on yet. l'm sure she'll want them. After you. OK Thanks Are you full? Uh-huh. So, what's on your mind? l've been assigned to a new case. Nothing big. A billionaire wants to get a divorce but his wife is making a big fuss When it comes to marriages, you're an expert. Of course. Great! Then l represent our law firm appointing you as our emotional consultant. Don't let me down. Just you wait and see. Now we shall discuss matters relating to your alimony l really don't understand women like you ln this day and age alimony is a ridiculous concept. Marriage is the result of free will, men and women are equals. Why should men pay alimony? Why did you get married in the first place? For starters you're just an extra mouth to feed. Your relationship to my client was that of a long term whore. l'm not trying to offend you. l'm simply stating the truth. You shouldn't assume that having been married gives you the right to ask for compensation. My client was married too and he invested just as much as you did. Screaming out hysterically "l wasted my best years on you, you must pay!" is something women in their late 40s like to do. For an old hag with children to feed asking for compensation is fair and just, that is what is meant by the word alimony. ln all the time you were married to my client you never once got pregnant. So what do you want compensation for? Women say that men having mistresses is shameful. Men say loving anybody is a tragedy. lf you still want money then it isn't an alimony, it's severance pay. Get me a glass of Rudini. Do you still love him? l hate him. OK, l'll settle it. l don't want to get divorced. Relax. l have good news Through my guidance l have made Mrs. Liu realise that it takes two to tango. She has decided to turn over a new leaf and save the marriage. Are you out of your mind? lf they don't get divorced l don't get paid. Which is more important: a life of wedded bliss or your fee? l am protecting my clients interests in line with the law. But that's so unfair to women. A lawyers job is to do his utmost to protect the interests of his client An emotional consultants job is to do her damnedest to heal emotional scars and protect a perfectly good marriage. Look, she lied to you. Take a close look at who the woman is! You disappoint me. He's a serpent, not a man. The bigger a mans' brain, the smaller his heart. Stop hiding! Well it isn't my fault. l told you you could take your time looking... Who created mankind, who made us like this? Well, you can't blame the creator for that. The population is huge When anything goes into mass production lt's hard to guarantee quality. This time l want a real man. This is iced water. The doctor says l can't drink that. Miss Nie, at last you're here! You're waiting for me? l've been waiting a long time. Oh? Hello! Ms. Nie. Ah? Do you have any special requirements? Special requirements? lsn't this a gym? Of course this is a gym! Some people come here to exercise And some people don't. You look as if you aren't here to exercise. So what am l here for if l'm not here to exercise?

Here you are Ma'am, try to be more careful next time. l will. Thank you. Sorry Lets go Thank you, go a little faster please Ok Please bring an end to his suffering Thank you Deforestation and the growth of urban areas has forced the Pandas' migration into the mountains. ln the past 30 years the panda population has decreased by 60%. Pandas are now scattered over thirty separate isolated habitats which are very much like islands. Breeding between separate panda groups is virtually impossible. As a consequence the pandas have become inbred causing recessive DNA Can l ask you a few questions OK Number one: Do you...do you eat meat No l'm pretty much a vegetarian, but... Number two : do you wear fur? No, not a big fan. Ooh, do leather shoes count? Number three: lf you got pregnant would you care for the baby? l've never even considered that question But... Here. Thanks. lt seems like you really enjoy your work. l don't... l...l don't like people. But at least when l'm here l can be close to nature. Why don't you like people? Humans are the ugliest and most lmpotent species on the face of this earth. We can't run, can't swim underwater and can't fly. When we're cold we wear more clothes, We have to turn up the air conditioning. We rely on tools for everything. Why should we be allowed to conquer and control this earth? lf the world we're to start from scratch again would man be at the top of the food chain? l think not. l think you might need to lighten up a bit. Can't man be friends with mother nature? Mankind has it's head in the clouds. Nobody really cares about nature. lf it continues to neglect it's existence How can mankind be friends with nature? Hi But you, you're different Today l want to introduce you to some of my friends. Hi Hi! Hello! This is creepy. Man and animals are the same : Being trapped in a cage can make anyone feel uncomfortable. Hey! Try to be nicer to animals in the future. This is beautiful. Many of these animals are on the brink of extinction. l haven't been to the zoo in a long time. These animals which are on the verge of extinction Are being decimated by the cruelty of mankind. Hey! That one's called Xiao Qiang. Xiao Qiangs got a huge appetite! Hey! Xiao Qiang! Over here! That's Xiang Xiang. Hey! That's Meng Meng, She got hurt a while back. Let's see how she's doing... Looks as if she's recovered. l've been hurt too. Ah! What are you doing? What does it look like? Let's take all our clothes off and get naked just like the fishes. Don't you like it here? l...l think you misunderstood me. But...it's beautiful here, it's so romantic! We can mate here like beasts, you're on heat,i can tell! This is the perfect spot. Ah! l don't want to! -Come on! -What are you doing? Get off me! Why are you running? Don't run! Driver, get me out of here, fast! Driver? Take me to Eagle Run Plaza Nie Bing? Don't you recognise your old class mate? lt's me Yuan Jia. Arch Enemy! Our old class monitor. Not bad, l see you still remember my nickname. lt wasn't hard. lt was always you that told on me, stuck your nose into my personal affairs and gave me a hard time! l didn't give you a hard time. All the boys in the class gave you a hard time You don't know this But back then after lights all the boys would say nasty things about you You can ask them which of them didn't write me love letters. She's here! Shhhh! Can l open them now? OK so you managed to persuade the superstar to come Our old class monitor must have been very persuasive! There's a question that has been bugging me for the past 12 years. Today l want an answer. How many of you wrote her love letters back then? l did! Me too. Me too! Me too! what? l think there's one more over here! Hey! l didn't! Put your hand up! Yuan Zheng Just admit it! Back then you were always complaining about him. l was scared you'd fall for him if l didn't. Even back then l knew he had a crush on you. Back then, we always complained about people we fancied. Yeah! Yeah! Back then,the class monitor had a huge crush on Nie Bing! He was always scheming of ways to give her a hard time. He even organised for us to... Stop! Lunch time. He's covering up. Aw! She's so cute! How many months pregnant are you? l'll be giving birth next month. Nie Bing, how have you been recently? Me? l don't think l'll ever get married. What nonsense? Why? Recently l've been having A reoccurring nightmare l die as an old spinster with only a black cat as company. -Oh that's just rubbish. -Let's talk about something else. Yes, no more nonsense. C'mon, cheers everyone! Yeah, cheers! ln this day and age, pigs eating people isn't a headline. Being married for ten years, now that's what i call news! Hey! Stop talking nonsense. l'm giving birth next month. lt's no wonder your still single. Pessimists like him will never find true love. He'll never be able to get divorced, 'cos he'll never get married. Makes sense. Yeah. Yeah. Right on. lt is better to rot with dignity Than to love in shame. Waiter! Yes sir! fetch me 1 kilo of true love l'll take it home to feed the dog! Yes sir, coming right up! What is marriage? Marriage is love's gravestone. lf marriage is loves gravestone, then those who do not marry die in unnamed graves. Yeah! Right on! l'll drink to that! Enough of boys vs. girls Let's change the subject. l heard one of our classmates business is going up on the market Even public toilets are going up on the market these days. They plan to make it a franchise called "The Shits" Can you make your language environmentally friendly? You did graduate with an honors in chinese literature You're in your late thirties Why haven't you mellowed out? l will never mellow out, not even in my eighties By then l will have perfected my skills of mockery. What level are you now? Black belt. lmpressive. Why don't you give us all a taste of your black belt cursing skills... What do you say? Let's hear it! But l have no one to curse. Just imagine that your standing opposite that bastard who poisoned the milk with melamine. He deserves a good cursing! You're a poorly evolved organism, An alien with stunted DNA, The thing that is blocking my septic tank, A premenstrual chimpanzee, The superorganism of an empire of cockroaches A pestilent vegetable A retarded fossil The black hole into which the universe continually implodes. Not even amoeba can survive on a keyboard you've touched. You're saliva is 100 times more deadly than SARS. lf you look up it opens a hole in the ozone layer. You are polluting the entire solar system So imagine the furthest place you can and piss off! Cool! Bravo! Back to the point. Today is the 8th anniversary of our graduation. Chinese literature class of 2000's reunion. Out of 28 classmates, 22 showed up. This is the largest reunion we've had. 9 of us are married, open bracket Four with kids, 3 girls 1 boy, close bracket. 2 more are pregnant and 13 are single. The reason l'm saying this is that we're all grown up now. Many of us are reaching middle age. lt's my responsibility as class monitor to remind you all to take good care of yourselves and treasure each day because... because one of our class mates has already left us She was the youngest member of our class When she passed away she was only 28 years old. Will you think about it tomorrow Diary yesterday? Will you still remember the days when you were a crybaby? The teachers have already forgotten about that student who never knew the answers. l only think about you when l browse Through old photo albums l wonder who married you? l heard the prom queen is in your class? She's called Nie Bing, nicknamed "the ice queen" Can you introduce me to her? Who are you? l'm a sophomore majoring in seduction, studying medicine. What do you want? A swap Our colleges' prom queen for yours. What do you think? l'm warning you, stay away from her. Who do you think you are? You two aren't even an item. Even if you were married she might have an affair... Eat up. For you! For me? Yes! Thank you! You're welcome Stay away from her. You're pretty tough on your own turf. Kick his ass. Originally my client was entitled to sue you for assault in which case you would be taken to court And be ordered to pay a fine of at least 100,000 RMB. Listen to me. l just wanted to get that girl into bed. l didn't think you'd take it so seriously. Suddenly l came to realize: Nie Bing really is unique Hey Look at me! This hurts! l have decided to use 8 years to seduce her. For the next 8 years, stay out of Beijing. lf l haven't succeeded after 8 years, then you can do what you like. As for your money, keep it! Does that sound fair to you? Wait! What? Don't you remember me? Oh yeah, You're Sun Boy. l like your music. Keep up the good work. l'm Yutong! Don't you remember me? Hey! Yes, when are you going to marry me? When you're runny nose stops running! lt's stopped! Oh! l remember now. Oh my god, you're snotty! That's me! You've grown so tall! l thought your family immigrated to Canada? l've been back for over a year now. Why did you come back? Especially to see you. Me? Hey! Hey! You aren't allowed to grab my skirt, understand? From now on, you're only allowed to hold my hand. OK? l'm a girl. You're all grown up. You being grown up makes me feel really old. The way i see it, you haven't aged a day. C'mon,let's wipe that snotty nose of yours.Yuck! Why is my nose so runny? When you're a grown up it'll dry. When will l be a grown up? When you're nose stops running, you'll know! Promise you'll wait for me. When l grow up l'll marry you. OK. You know When l was abroad, l'd often paint pictures of you by memory Each time l'd imagine the traits of the most beautiful women and combine them all together. Well, l'm not a picture. But l can change you so that you look like the picture You? Change me? you can't catch me wanna bet? gotcha! you can't catch me l'm coming to get you! Yuck! What? You've got a snotty nose again! l don't know... Ok again. Ready? One l'm telling you once again this is our last date. Why? Every time we go out lt feels like l'm babysitting. So what? So we came from different generations, at least we're the same kind of person. That's easy for you to say because you're so young. One of these days you'll find it just as easy to say "sorry" and run off with someone your age. l'd never do that. Everytime l see you l feel so alive. l can see your heart beating l don't want to hear it. Just shut up. l told you before l came back for you and to relive my childhood dream. And now you've lived your dream you're childhood should come to an end. Yes. My childhood is over and l should return to the real world. Well, it's about time. ln the real world l have to go back to Canada to finish my studies l should have guessed. l wanted to persuade you to quit your job And move back with me But...that would be too selfish Because l don't need your reasons. You've decided to go back to Canada alone. You really know me well. Better than l know myself. ln that case you should know what l have to do before l leave. Of course, You want to settle our relationship. Yes. Our past, present and future together None of them need explaining. After a year like l've had l can accept pretty much anything. Good. Before l go l want you to know The plans l have made for our future together. After i graduate, i'll come to work in Beijing. l'll find somewhere we can afford the rent. l know you like eating at night And l know you like soybean milk So we'll choose somewhere that has a 24 hour soybean milk store close by. l'll buy you hot milk in winter, and iced milk in summer. l'll get you take away no matter how late. lt might not be the most romantic plans But it's like a hot bowl of noodles Readily available l've already bought a ring When my mother arrives l'll kneel down and propose to you Your mother! Yes. l've already told her She's coming over from Canada She should be here any minute now. Don't worry. l'm sure she'll respect my decision She'll understand l need to go to the washroom Oh! Bing Bing! lt's you! A Jie! Oh my god! How long has it been? What a coincidence bumping into you here! lt's been donkeys years. You're more gorgeous than ever! Here for a meal with your husband? l'm here alone Oh! Divorced? l haven't married yet. Oh. You mustn't be too choosy. You're no spring chicken. 30? Well hurry up lf you don't get hitched soon your choices get less and less. Age is heartless Your mum wasn't in any hurry. l need to have a chat with here someday Hey! lf you've got time you can come and meet my son, Yutong, do you remember him? Yeah. You always made fun of his runny nose. He's all grown up now. A handsome young man. All the girls at university fancy him, even the foreign ones. You won't even recognize him. That son of mine ls going to give me a heart attack He said "I want to go back to Beijing", I said "fine!" Then it's "l want to make an album" "OK." A while back he said he'd fallen in love "good for you" Now he says he's getting married! And you know what's worse He says the woman is ten years older than he is! lt's crazy! C'est incroyable C'est dingue C'est pas possible! C'est ridicule! l was so shocked l got on the first plane to Beijing Our meeting here must be fate. You can do me a favour and set my son straight. He needs to be taught a lesson. ls he retarded? l mean, what a joke 10 years! ls he looking for a wife or a nanny? He's been back for year and he wants to get married? lt's obvious my boy has been seduced. What does that cradle snatching little minx think she's doing? lt's immoral. lt's inhumane, don't you think? A Jie...l... l...l'm sorry... That's it! l've had enough. You can have your car back. Are you boring! l'm sorry you hold me in such low esteem Because of you, he had to leave Beijing. Because of you, he was mine for eight years. Those days back in Yunnan Right up until the end of my days He was always there for me. He gave me everything, except his love. He was saving that for you. Now l return him to you Are you finally at a loss for words? 12 is a magic number lt completes the cycle. l remember when we started college The freshers party was the first time l saw you. 12 years have past. You were the first girl l ever loved, the only girl l ever loved. Sounds like a line from a korean soap opera. Not really your style. lf l told you that is the one most sincere thing l ever said Would you believe me? So what do you believe? l believe in my heart.
