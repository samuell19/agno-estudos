Now that I notice it, you're always there next to me, but do I actually hate you? Love you? Or am I delusional? When I take a look at my feelings clearly, whether I'm a lady or a host, it doesn't matter to me. People fall in love for all sorts of different reasons, but... I want to see you now, to give your tender self cherry-blossom kisses, and if your heart beats faster, let's let our love bloom. Right now is more vital than the future. The springtime of love's beauty is the aesthetic of a damsel in bloom. Oh... You're not eating breakfast? Mm-mm. Okay, well, I'm off. "School fair day 2 - main fair" "Central Building Salon" "The Host Club is open for business to the general public" Welcome. You're one of the sons from the Otori family, right? But as third son, no matter how hard you struggle, you'll never succeed the family. What would you like today? How much of Haruhi Fujioka's debt remains? Haruhi... You've been requested. By your leave. Tamaki seemed to have quite a soft spot for you. You mean to say, you are jealous? Well, listen to you. Tamaki won't be coming. I ordered him not to show his face again at the Host Club. I wonder what happened to Tama-chan. I don't believe the declaration his highness made yesterday. I have decided to get engaged to Lady Eclair Tonnerre here. Further, the Host Club will be dissolved following Ouran Fair. Come on, no more idle chatter. Our guests are waiting. How cool of you, Kyoya-senpai. We will entertain to the best of our ability the guests who have come to the Host Club to enjoy themselves. That is the most important thing right now. He's right, Kao-chan. What are you doing, Honey-senpai?! Let's go, Hikaru. Wait, Mori-senpai... Thank you for all of the work you've done for so long, Haruhi. With that request from Lady Eclair, your quota has been met. The debt for that Renaissance vase that you broke is now cleared. You are free to quit being a host at any time now. "This is Our Ouran Fair!" When you're young, you may be under the illusion that there is all the time in the world, but in reality, that is not so. Don't go wasting your time in things that are of no value! In this Host Club... Kyoya-senpai works as hard as he can for everyone to enjoy themselves. By entertaining everyone, we also come to feel fulfilled. Is entertaining everyone really so worthless? I think that Kyoya-senpai is outstanding. So, that is the honor student that Kyoya talks about, is it? Grand Tonnerre is a dangerous foe, which has recently been bringing Japanese businesses under their umbrella, one after the next. It is of no matter. Once we have an heir, the Suou family will prosper even more. After all, the boy cannot turn against the Suou family. Tamaki is not all that interested in the Suou family. What measures have you employed? I told him that if he becomes engaged to Lady Eclair, I would allow him to see his mother. You would still... I am only having your son make amends for the mismanagement of your life. Tamaki won't be coming. I ordered him not to show his face again at the Host Club. Are you Tamaki's lover? No. I see. Good. Then you're nothing to him. I am not his lover, but I am not nothing to him. You'd best not have any contact with your friends for a while. It will make you reluctant to leave them, right? Come in. There is a visitor here to see you. Have them come in. Uncle... Why is Tamaki-kun here? Never mind him. Nice to see you again, Uncle. I am the one who asked Kyoya into the Host Club. I'm sorry. But then, Uncle, what are you doing here? We're terribly sorry to have asked you to come all the way here. On the contrary, I am rather served by being able to avoid the press. My medical equipment company is apparently about to be purchased by Grand Tonnerre over here. It probably serves Kyoya right. The company that I was thinking of transferring to him will be out of his hands now. Uncle, I have one request, right off. What is with this outfit? We told you, it's a costume for the special parade. Haru-chan, you look cute! Not that. Why am I the only one dressed as a girl? Who cares? This is cosplay, so dressing like you're a girl is completely okay! "Like" I'm a girl? Well? No good. He's not answering. Tamaki-senpai really did end up not showing his face once at the salon today. Ah, Shima-san? It's been too long. This is Kyoya. "Suou second estate" This is about Master Tamaki, right? The Master will be departing for France. I tried to stop him, but he said that the Suou family had forgiven his mother, and that he could finally make his mother happy. Also, he said that if he stayed at Ouran any longer, his capriciousness would only make trouble for you, Kyoya-sama, and everyone else. That idiot. Tamaki is planning to return to France. Tama-chan is leaving?! You've gotta be kidding! I'm not about to let this end so suddenly! Hikaru... Kyoya-sama... Yes? I, Shima, was thinking, if the Master's mother is really the sort of lady that the Master always spoke of, then I am sure she would not be pleased with the manner in which the Master is leaving Ouran. When is he leaving for France? His plane is this evening. That soon? He said he would leave Japan tonight, as the Ouran Fair was ending. Tamaki! Tama-chan! Sir! The Ouran Fair isn't over yet! My family's car should be in the parking lot! Let's go, Haruhi! We are in a hurry. Head out at once. Kyoya-sama... What's the matter? T-The thing is... What are your orders? Were you ordered to protect Lady Eclair? I am truly sorry that it has come to this, but we, the private police, answer to your father. Damn it! I'm terribly sorry, but we cannot allow anyone to leave. Even if we must do so by force. Use the carriage. If you take the back hills bypass, you can cut them off. It's Haninozuka and Morinozuka... Haruhi! Haruhi, go get that idiot. Get going, Hikaru! What are you doing?! Stop that carriage! Takashi, be sure to pull your punches! I know. I told you, picking on my friends was a no-no! Don't think you can get the best of the Ouran Host Club. Hikaru, Kaoru, Haruhi, bring Tamaki back. Hikaru! This much speed is reckless, to say the least! We're bringing his highness back, no matter what! Hikaru... If it weren't for his highness, we would still be left out of this world! It's because of the Host Club that we were able to meet Haruhi, and become so close to everyone else, too! Having the Host Club end as suddenly as this... ...is something that I couldn't take! Hikaru! Hikaru... Hikaru... Hikaru, are you okay? Does your arm hurt? Damn it all... Is this really how we're going to end, sir? Hikaru... Okay, well, I'm off. Is it something that talking to your dad won't help? Why do you ask? Really, I just don't want to eat this morning, that's all. After your mother's funeral, it took some time before you were able to eat breakfast again, too, right? I won't ever be able to see Mom again? There certainly are a lot of things in this world that you can't do anything about, try though you might. Remember, Haruhi, this is exactly why you can't hesitate when it's time to stick things out. Haruhi? What's the matter? You haven't said anything. You're a host, aren't you? Entertain me. What about you? Are you really okay with getting engaged to a man that you just met, on orders from your family? Haruhi! Haruhi Fujioka? What are you doing, Haruhi?! It's too dangerous! Stop the carriage, now! Senpai! Please come back! Look, just stop the carriage! Nobody wants you to leave, Senpai! But, everyone says that they are put out by the Host Club... Senpai, you really are an idiot. A blithering idiot! After as long as we've been together, can't you even tell when we're joking or being serious!? We all like being in the Host Club! We really like it! Even I... Even I like being in the Host Club! Haruhi! Haruhi! Senpai! What a reckless thing to do. Look, you're soaking wet because of it. That doesn't matter, does it? Like they say, "a man dripping with good looks," right? Tama-chan! Haru-chan! Sir! Geez, what a moron. Drive on. Eclair-sama, you heard all those stories from that one housekeeper, right? About her son, who always played the piano for her? Is he really that nice a boy? Thank you. And here, I was going to let him see his mother again. The fool... Still, just for me, he smiled. I'm sorry for having caused you concern. Grand Tonnerre has turned away from my company. An unexpected backer turned up, acquired the company before Tonnerre could, and then said that he was turning all management rights over to me. That was quite bold. Which fund manager was it? A student investor, named "K.O." He cleverly kept his name out of it, but I eventually learned who it was. "K.O." "Kyoya Otori." It was none other than my own son. This is what's meant by being afraid for the future. I thought I knew how brilliant Kyoya-kun was, but... No, your son is the one who is truly amazing. I am the one who gave Kyoya his education. I knew that he was more brilliant than his older brothers. However, while the Kyoya that I know might take over a company, he wouldn't do anything like give it all back to me. I brought Kyoya up all this time dangling the carrot of taking over the companies managed by the Otori family in front of him. But not only has he taken it from me by force, he said he didn't want it, and thrust it right back in my face. Do you understand what that means? He has found it. Something that has even greater value to him. And it is probably thanks to Tamaki-kun. We have come to be somewhat competitive with each other, but from now on, maybe we'll get along just fine. Yes. I would like for us to get along. Like our sons do. Oh, right, there was one thing that I wanted to check with you. That honor student girl--Fujioka Haruhi, was it? I'm thinking of having her marry Kyoya in the future. Please keep that in mind. I guess I'm not going to get along with you after all. All other things aside, that is definitely something I will not concede. Those with the wherewithal--first, in social standing, and second, in money--spend their time here, at the private Ouran Academy. As such, Ouran Host Club is where handsome boys with too much time on their hands entertain and charm girls, who also have too much time on their hands. It is the school's own personal, elegant playground for the super-rich. If your fancy leads you, please come by and visit us in Music Room #3, any time. --All of us here at the Host Club... --All of us here at the Host Club... ...from the bottom of our hearts... "We will be waiting for you." --...will be waiting for you. --...will be waiting for you.
