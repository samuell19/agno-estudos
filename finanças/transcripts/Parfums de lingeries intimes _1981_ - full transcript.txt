Do you want to warm up at my place? It depends. What are you offering me? How about a massage of your cock between my tits? Yeah, how much? Five hundred francs. And one thousand francs without condom. Your breasts turn me on. But I only have this much on me. Are you kidding me? Get lost! Who do you think you are? With these tits, it's more than enough. Oh, you're really kidding me! At that price you can have Lise. She's sixty years old. - She'll suck you for fifty bucks. - Yeah. Beat it, cheapskate. Hello, Armand. I didn't expect to see you at the office. Yeah. Here, look. It's your ex-wife, she needs money. Again! Bills. Just bills, always bills! Lawyer. Rent, electricity, telephone. - And this, what is it? - What? 1200 francs. For two persons! They're completely nuts. It wasn't that expensive! That's not the problem. This time, the situation is critical, Christian. We're heading for bankruptcy. I told you you're spending too much money,that's all. Do you think that spending 1200 francs for a meal is reasonable? - Forget it, its ancient history. - Come on! To save money, I take the bus. Yes, I know, but you should have kept your car. I had to sell it! Well, find a solution! Someone could lend us money! There is no solution. I'll never get a loan again. It's your turn now. That's a great idea! Why always me? How about Nicole? You think she throws her money down the drain. At least, you could try. She has always loved you. All right, I'll try. But I can't promise you anything. - Goodbye. - Good luck. Thanks. Here. - To your health. To your health, too. And to a better future. Armand, you look worried. Do you want to talk about it? Well, actually, Christian and me... At the moment we have problems. No orders. And on top of that, some debts. It's not going well. What will become of us? Don't worry, I will help you settle your debts. You're very sweet but I don't like to borrow. Especially from a woman. For me it's a principle. We'll find a solution. Let's talk of other things. We must not mix love with business. - Good morning, ma'am. - Good morning, sir. It's pretty cold. - Looks like it's going to snow. - Yes, could be. - "Paris Rencontre", please. - Yes I need to warm up, if you know what I mean. Here you are, sir. Thank you. Here you are. Keep the change for a coffee. Thank you. So, in the end, you chickened out and now we're out of business. You think it's easy to take money from Nicole? I can't bring myself to do it. We must find another solution. Here, for a woman it's easier. Listen to this. Woman, forty years old, buxom, without any complexes, With shaved pussy welcomes you day and night. How about this one : Exotic woman, twenty years old sweet and affectionate... That's it! - Now that's a great idea! - What? We post modeling ads and we get paid to fuck. Have you ever thought how many women get bored at home? And do you know what they're thinking? "Where can I find a big cock to fuck me?" There's business to be done. How do we do it? You think we're gonna fuck them here, in the office? I'd like something more comfortable. I have an idea. A good idea. I have an uncle who owns a villa. He is an annuitant. What are you waiting for? You should take his money! The house is not occupied. My uncle has settled in Mauritius Island. I already fucked a girl there. Of course Nicole doesn't know. So, what's your idea? Idiot! You don't get it! This villa is spacious and isolated. It's ideal for our project. That's exactly what we need. And there is no rent to pay. Well, the house problem is resolved. Now, how can we attract clients? The ads and... By reputation. After all, we're not bad looking. No, I look great. Well then, let's go! Let's inspect the place. I would have never thought that advertising would lead me to this. - Please, dear madam. - Please, sir. Here we are. Here, this will be the reception desk. In this spot, we will have a desk. And here, this will be the cloakroom. Upstairs,the bedrooms and the bathroom. Everything has been completely redone. - There is also a big attic. - Yes. - It's big. - Yes, but first things first : The great lounge. This way. Here we are. We just have to remove the dust sheets, and there you have it. I thought about something, Armand. I don't know if you thought about it. Who's going to fuck the older ones? I don't know. But, logically, Since you fuck every girl you meet... - Yes. It'll be you. - No way. If my memory serves me correctly, it was your idea. So you'll have to handle this. - You're too kind. - I've always been generous. Yes, I noticed it. - What do you mean? - With my money, my women. - You're exaggerating. - Never mind. - That's my good old Armand! - I'm used to it. In the end, it's true that you're great. Maybe, but upstairs there is still work to be done. Don't wear yourself out. Save your energy. If someone calls, we must be ready to answer the desires of these ladies. We must keep our reputation high. Hello, this is 51-99-25. Hello, I have your ad right in front of me. Armand!
