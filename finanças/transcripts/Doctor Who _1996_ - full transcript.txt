It was on the Planet Skaro that my old enemy, The Master, was finally put on trial. They say he listened calmly as his list of evil crimes was read, and sentence passed. Then he made his last, and I thought somewhat curious, request. He demanded that, I, The Doctor, a rival Time Lord, should take his remains back to our home planet, Gallifrey. It was a request they should never have granted. A Time Lord has 73 lives, and The Master had used all of his. But rules never meant much to him. So, I stowed his remains safely for the voyage back. Because even in death I couldn't trust him. There, that should do it. In all my travels through space and time, And nearing the end of my seventh life, I was finally beginning to realise that you could never be too careful. Oh, no. Come on, let's go. Watch it! Where are you going? Hey, where you going? Come here, man. Come back here. - Wimp. - Get outta there. - We're fine, man. - Yeah. Hey, is this style OK? Yeah, all right. Cool, cool! - Lee, did you see that thing blow? - Yeah. Get down! Say your prayers, Lee. What was that thing? Timing malfunction. I'm getting you an ambulance. Stop it. Stop it. What? Here it comes. Hold in there, old guy. Chang Lee will help you. Hey, over here. - Were you with him when it happened? - Yeah, we were just passing. Is he rich? 'Cos where we're going, he'd better be rich. Here. Hey, I'm not signing anything, Mister. Sign it or we can't do nothing. Come on, kid. - What's the date? - December, 30th. 1999. On three. One, two, go... Three. Look out, coming through. Go, go, go! We're losing him! Yeah, go! We don't have much time. Two hearts? One bullet went straight through his shoulder. No damage. The other two are in his left leg. Look, two hearts! - What? - As if. It's a double exposure, Curtis. Let's get these bullets out, then. Now, this went straight through... Heart's still going like crazy. - Then we'll have to bring in cardiology. - Who's on tonight? Amazing Grace. I have to go. Excuse me, pardon me. Excuse me. Fibrillation at 300. - 300? - Yes. - No blockages showing? - No. - X-ray? - N.G. - What? - Double exposed every time we try. - Well, then, try again. - We're getting another machine. - That'll take another half-hour. - No, no, we don't have time for that. - We have got to get moving on this. - Dr Holloway, it's Brian. Yeah. Brian! I'm sorry. Listen, I'm on call. What do you expect me to do, ignore it? No, look, Brian, don't say that. Listen, just wait until I get home. Brian? Sorry. - Probe. - Probe. - Scalpel. - Scalpel. And straight to track four. Track four coming up. Puccini, Madame Butterfly. Whatever you're about to do, stop! - Mr Smith, you're going to be all right. - No, I'm not human. I'm not like you. Nobody's like you, Mr Smith. Please, I need a beryllium atomic clock. This is 1999, isn't it? We can't wait any longer, Grace. No, I'm not human... I'm not human. - I'm not human! - It's OK, I got it. Try not to speak, Mr Smith. We've already taken out all the bullets. So, now we're going to listen to your heart, try to find out why it's so wild, and then I'm going to fix it. You'll be fine. OK. He's under. Timing malfunction. The Master, he's out there. He's out there... Scalpel. I've got to stop! You know, somehow I don't think this man's name is Mr Smith, do you? You get that feeling? Here we have an electrophysiology being performed by one of our senior cardiologists, Dr Holloway. Who will insert a microsurgical probe into the patient's artery. Then search out the short-circuiting part causing the fibrillation, and just so you know your money is being well spent... we'll blast it with lasers. So, is Brian threatening to leave again? - He won't. - That's strange. What? DÃ©ja vu. Where am I? Uh, subclavian. I should be in the brachiocephalic. Uh, not unless this man's a donkey. Then I am lost. Let me try something. Massive seizure, get that probe out of there! - I'm trying! - Picture's out! - Damn it! We're dropping off fast. - Just pull it out! - Come to me. - Get it out of there, Grace. - No blood! I can't get it out of him. - Grace, he's flatlining. The probe snapped. It's still in him. Clear! Clear! Clear! Clear! Clear! Give me 300. Clear! Clear! Clear! It's no good. - Time of death. - 10:03. I got lost. - I wanna see his X-rays now! - Grace! This is all his stuff. There is no identification there, either. Tag him as a John Doe and book him for an autopsy. You want me to bring that kid in? Maybe he can help us with an identification. - Doctor? - Sure. This is no double exposure. - Sir? - Hmm? Yeah. I'm up. Could you just come with me, please? - You're the doctor? - Yes. Yes, I am. - Are you a friend of Mr Smith's? - Yeah, is he OK? Actually there were some complications, and I'm afraid he didn't make it. Sorry. It's OK. I'll tell his family. Are these his things? Yeah. - I'll take them. - Um... Maybe we should contact the family ourselves. No, Miss, this will hit them really hard. I'll tell them. You don't know this man at all, do you? - Yeah, I do. - Then, tell me his real name. I gotta go. Wait! Somebody stop him! Shut up! Bruce, please? Hey, man. You doing anything special New Year's Eve? - Going to the costume party. - Oh, yeah, me too. Who you going as? - Wild Bill Hickok. - All right, cool. Who's that? John Doe, on the toe. Oh, we've got a nice autopsy booked for you tomorrow morning, Mister. Followed by a sauna or a Swedish herbal wrap. What would be your pleasure? 1:00 a.m. Hey! It's December, 31st, 1999. - Party on! - Yee-haw! Sweet dreams. Hey, hey, look out. It's alive. It's alive, it's alive! It's alive! I knew it! I knew it! Hey, Chad, is that you? Hello? Who's there? Oh, my God! God, no! Who am I? Who am I? Who... am... I? Dr Anderson, to emergency room four. Dr Anderson, please report to emergency room four. You doing anything special New Year's Eve? - Going to the costume party. - Oh, yeah, me too. - Who you going as? - Wild Bill Hickok. All right, cool. Weird. I must find The Doctor. This body won't last long. I need The Doctor's body. Hmm, sense of humour, no more snoring? You don't need a doctor. Come back to bed, honey. My name is not "Honey". Oh, well, what would you like me to call you, then? "Master" will do. Well, come back to bed, Master. Ah, Doctor, soon I will have all your lives. It wasn't the same guy. Sounds like you saw the guy who stole the body. He was wearing a shroud and a JD tag on his toe. Somehow, I don't think the second coming happens here. Right, you think he's going to go to a better hospital? You know what? - I'm going home. - Hey, Pete. Stop by psychiatric and pick up some more mind-altering drugs. OK, sure. Listen, Curtis, can you get SFPD on this? Some creep's made off with the John Doe that died last night. Ew, body snatchers. ...please report to administration. Don't call the police just yet, Curtis. Grace, can you give me some time? Time. Keep the stairway clear, please. Time. Time. We don't need to advertise our mistakes, do we? What are you saying? Two hearts, no wonder you got lost. Exactly. Or maybe, this really was a double exposure. In either case, I can't afford to lose you. - Wait... What, what are you doing? - What we should have done last night. Am I having a bad dream here? I lose a patient and then I lose his body and now you have just destroyed the only proof... That you were careless? - No, that I had no way of knowing... - Stop! A man died last night because you lost your way. You bet I did! You saw the X-ray, the guy had two hearts! And now without a body or without records, no one need know he was even here. - You can't do this. - Let me take care of this, Grace. No! Believe me, I know what is best for all of us. But, what was he? How can we learn from him? I've got to find his body. And I have to keep this hospital open. No, no! If you do this, I'll quit. You don't mean that. Hold... Hold the elevator. Puccini. We've met before. Ugh, I don't think so. Yes, yes, I think so. I know you. You're tired of life, but afraid of dying. There was music, Madame Butterfly. - You were there. I saw you last night. - It wasn't me. Ugh, I don't know who I am, but I know that you know me. - Please, go away! - Please. - You're my only hope. - I'll call security. - Do you know who I am? - I don't care who you are! Leave me alone! Oh, please, you must help me. You're a doctor! Yeah, well, my oath just expired. Stand back. Get out, get out! It's my hearts! There's something... It can't be! What is this? What is it? Please, please! I have two hearts. You have to get me out of here before they kill me again. Please. Please, you have to help me. Drive! Hey! OK, OK. Hey, Bruce, why the shades? I had a bad night. Did you want something? What happened to the gunshot wound I brought in? I've got orders to move him. He died. Oh, yeah. Well, I've got orders to move his body. Where is it? - His body? - Well, haven't you heard? The body's gone. - Stolen. - OK. Where are his things? The kid that brought him in ran off with them. The Asian child. The Asian child? Bruce, you're sick! Thank you. - Are you all right? - Better, yes. Good. Now I don't have a piece of primitive wiring in my cardiovascular system. Primitive? I don't believe it. - He's taken all his stuff. - Who? - Brian. - Your boyfriend? Ex-boyfriend. Listen, why don't you just have a seat and open your shirt? I wanna listen to your heart. Hearts. Plural. Right. Right. He's taken the sofa. Come on, follow me. - Now I'm remembering more. - Good. Lovely view. Maybe you have selective amnesia brought on by shock. Maybe, I can't remember. Ah, Da Vinci, he had a cold when he drew that. - You're still fibrillating badly. - No, I'm not. Here. I remember! I was with Puccini before he died! - Name dropper. - I was, I was, I was! Shh. - Oh, my God. - You see, that's no echo. He died before he could finish Turandot. Alfano finished it based on his notes. It was so sad. You have two hearts! - Who are you? - I was dead too long this time. The anaesthetic almost destroyed the regenerative process. Yeah, right. I'm gonna get a syringe. - I'm going to take some blood. - No. No. - I want to know what's going on here. - Grace, Grace, Grace, Grace. Don't you see? I have thirteen lives. Please! OK, you're trying to tell me that you've come back from the dead? - Yes! - No, sorry. The dead stay dead. You can't turn back time. Yes, you can. I'm not a child. Don't talk to me like I'm a child. Only children believe that crap. I am a doctor. But it was a childish dream that made you a doctor. You dreamt you could hold back death. Isn't that true? Don't be sad, Grace. You'll do great things. Hello? Who's there? The guy from the ambulance? Bruce, don't scare me like that. - This place is freaky enough. - Lee? Chang Lee, that's your name, isn't it? Well, I never. The TARDIS really likes you. What are you talking about, Bruce? I'm not Bruce. It took me a minute with the talking and the walking, but I am not Bruce. I am merely inside his body. Oh, yeah? So, uh, who are you, really? Give me the bag. Yes. - Where is he? - Who? The man you stole these things from, where is he? Those are mine now, he's dead. He's not dead! He's stolen my body. - But... - And I will die unless we bring him back here. You're going to help me do that, do you understand? What's in it for me? You get to live. Hmm, not bad. - Did these belong to... - Brian? Yep. Keep 'em. Thank you. How's my blood? It's not blood. Hmm. Perhaps if I walk in them, stretch them a bit, they'll fit me better. Good idea, let's go for a walk. Maybe you're the result of some weird genetic experiment. I don't think so. - You have no recollection of family... - No. No. No, no, no, no. Wait, wait. I remember... I'm with my father, we're lying back in the grass. It's a warm Gallifreyan night. - Gallifreyan? - Gallifrey! Yes, this must be where I live. - Now, where is that? - I've never heard of it! What do you remember? A meteor storm. The sky above us was dancing with lights. Purple, green, brilliant yellow! Yes! - What? - These shoes! They fit perfectly. Yes. Yes. You know, this was all mine until he stole it from me. He should never have been allowed to be here. - You know, I was told he was dead. - That body had died, but now he's regenerated into another one. My body can do this twelve times, but he's taken most of my regenerations. What did he do with them? Unspeakable crimes... Like what? Genghis Khan? - What about him? - That was him. - No way! - Yes way. Look, I'm no saint, but he is evil, and he's doing it all with my body. I was on the verge of stopping him when we got here. Oof. What do you want, Lee? What do you mean? If you could have anything, anything at all, what would it be? I don't know. A million bucks! Only a million? - OK, two million. - Think bigger. - A billion dollars! - And what would that buy you? Power. Power. Gold dust? You get the rest, when I get my body back. Deal? Deal! Let me show you around. Go ahead. Whoa, how'd I do that? I told you, the TARDIS likes you. The Cloister Room. - Awesome. - Isn't it? Come, let me show you. Here is the Eye of Harmony, the heart of the structure. Everything gets its power from here. So how can it help us find him? Well, as you know, it used to belong to me, but now it belongs to him. If we can open the Eye, we will find him. Cool! - So, you gonna open it? - No, you are. See if you can pull this reflector staff from its mooring. - This thing? - Mmm-hmm. You can do it. Yes... Good. Now, look into the beam of light. If the TARDIS really likes you, the Eye will open. - Why don't you look? - You pulled the staff from the stone. What is it? Something's happening. - Something's happening... - OK. - Something's happening. - Oh, my God, oh, my God. Oh, my God! I know who I am! I am The Doctor! Good! Now do that again. Whoa, what? There's the guy I took to the hospital! The Doctor's past life. - "Doctor"? - That's what he calls himself. "Doctor". The new Doctor. He's so young. Hmm. Fascinating. Ah. See that? That's the retinal structure of the human eye. The Doctor is half human! No wonder. What? No. I saw him. The Master is here. What are you talking about? He's planning to take my body, so that he will live and I will die! Oh, no! He has opened the Eye of Harmony. What is the "Eye of Harmony"? Wait. Wait. There! We're seeing what he's seeing. I know that woman! - Ah! - I'm closing my eyes so he can't see you, Grace, but it maybe too late. What's the "Eye of Harmony"? It's the power source at the heart of the TARDIS. The TARDIS? What's a TARDIS? The TARDIS is my ship that carries me through time and space. T-A-R-D-I-S. It stands for Time and Relative Dimension in Space. And this Master, is he like the Devil? The Master is a rival Time Lord. "Time Lord"? Oh, my God. Pure evil. I was bringing home his remains from Skaro, where his final incarnation had exterminated by the Daleks, or so we thought. - You really are insane, aren't you? - But he wasn't dead. It's a trap. Don't you see? It's a trap. He wants me to look into the Eye. If I look into the Eye of Harmony, my soul will be destroyed, he will take my body... Listen to all those lies. How could she believe him? - I don't want to deal with this. - Grace, listen! - That's enough! - If the Eye of Harmony isn't closed, this planet will be sucked through it! Grace, I need to fix the timing mechanism on the TARDIS and close the Eye. I need an atomic clock. Grace, please, help me find one. Grace. Grace. Grace? Grace! So that's how he intends to destroy me. How? We must get to the Doctor before he finds a clock. I know that woman. She was the surgeon who operated on him last night. Well, if you find her, we'll find him. - Grace! - You just stay away from me! Oh, come on, Grace, please just let me in. No! Grace! Let me in. We can sit down, we can have a cup of tea, we can talk about this reasonably. - Sure, Time Lord to Earthling. - Yes, that's right. I am a Time Lord. - I thought you were a doctor. - I thought you were a doctor! I am calling an ambulance to take you back to Psychiatric from which you have obviously escaped! Grace, we don't have time for this. The Eye of Harmony is open. If I don't close it, get my TARDIS and the Master off this planet, this planet will no longer exist! - I'm calling the ambulance. - Grace, we have until midnight. Come on, come on. Yes, yes, I'll hold. Grace! I shall prove to you the Eye of Harmony is open, look at this! Yes... Ah. You see, already the molecular structure of the planet is changing. I'm going to need an ambulance as soon as possible. This is Doctor Grace Holloway. At first, in subtle ways, but soon in catastrophic ways. I need a bed in Psychiatric. By midnight tonight, this planet will be pulled inside out. There will be nothing left. I think you'd better make that two beds. Doctor, Doctor. Come on, she needs an ambulance. ...last night's shooting in Chinatown. Police believe the murders... Grace. Grace. I've lost 20 pounds. Congratulations. In 20 minutes? It's starting. You can make a fortune in the weight-loss business, Doctor. ...about the strange natural phenomena. Since early this evening, Bay Area tides have risen to levels that break all records for this time of year. Flood warnings have gone out along the Napa and Russian rivers... Grace, look! ...and believe it or not, in Hawaii it has even started snowing. You maybe wondering what this has to do with the millennium. Scientists say that the freak conditions are due to the very slight fluctuations in the Earth's gravitational pull. Fluctuations that apparently only happen once every thousand years. Here's what our cameras in Hawaii... I love humans. Always seeing patterns in things that aren't there. And most fashionable San Franciscans are going tonight to ring in the new year. And of course, you'll be there, won't you? Naturally. Now, didn't you say they'll see a clock getting started? That's right, and you know, it isn't just any old clock. It happens to be the most accurate atomic clock in the world, and it's right here at the Institute of Technological Advancement and Research in downtown San Francisco. So don't go away. Atomic clock. ...any old clock... the most accurate atomic clock in the world. - That must be a beryllium clock! - They're here. Excellent! They can take us straight to the Institute. We need to go straight to the Institute of Technological Advancement and Research. Do you know where that is? Of course I do. What time is it now? Half past ten. Don't worry, I'm on the Board of Trustees at the Institute. They'll listen to me. Won't this thing go any faster? Come on, come on, come on, come on. Can't you give him a sedative? Grace, why did you not say you had access to a beryllium clock? I was more concerned about the Eye of Destruction. - Harmony! - Yes, yes. And the fact that the planet will be sucked through it at midnight. I mean, face it. It's not often one has a Time Lord in one's living room, Doctor. He likes me to call him "Doctor". - Well... - You know, Freud had a name for that. Transference. Yes, very witty, Grace. At least Freud would've taken me seriously. He'd have hung up his pipe if he'd met you. - Actually, we did meet. - Oh, that's right. He's a Time Lord. We got on very well. - Did you know Madam Curie, too? - Intimately! - Did she kiss as good as me? - As well as you. Looks like a truck's blocking all the lanes. There you go... This planet is about to be destroyed, and I'm stuck in a traffic jam. Excuse me. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! What is it? I can't be injured like this! Come on! Get it off me! Get it off me! Get it off me! Get it off me! Get it off me! Hey, just keep back! Get back! Stop right there, sir, ma'am. Go back to your vehicle. What? Stop! He's, er, he's British. Yes, I suppose I am. Jelly Baby, Officer? - Jelly Baby? - Just take it. Now, would you stand aside before I shoot myself. - Don't be a fool. - Are you with me, Grace? We don't stand a chance! Would you excuse me, please? Grace, I came back to life before your eyes. I held back death. Look, I can't make your dream come true forever, - but I can make it come true today. - Yo, let's go! Taxis down here... Give me the gun. OK, give him the keys. Thank you. - What are we waiting for? - The road's still blocked. This is an ambulance! Right. - Maybe I should have kept the gun. - What? Look! Doctor, look out! Breathe in, Grace. - Don't worry. - I'm not worried. What are you doing, Lee? - This way's quicker. - It better be. Look, this is my town. I know what I'm doing. Trust me. Faster. So, what's the plan, anyways? We'll let him get to their clock, then we'll get his body. - I think we lost them. - Good, hold on! Hey, man, when I get all that gold, you know what I'm going to do? I don't wanna know. - You kill me. - You want me to kill you? No! No, I mean you make me laugh, man. You're a funny guy. - I'm glad one of us is amused. - Hey, look, cheer up, man. You'll get your body back soon, and then we're a team, right? Yes, we're a team. Not again! Oh! Great! I finally meet the right guy and he's from another planet. - Doctor! - Yes? I only have one life. Could you remember that? I'll try! Thank you! Oh, no! Doctor, look. Doctor Grace Holloway and guest. - There you are. - Hello, happy new year! First time being on the board of this place has ever done me any good. He must have found a back way in. I can't see him. Sorry, no one beyond this point. Oh, this is Doctor Bowman from London. They're waiting for him. Come on. You'll be allowed in with everyone else. I'm on the Board of Trustees. Thank you very much. Come on. Welcome to the Institute of Technological Advancement and Research. After dinner, Professor Wagg will invite you to join him in celebrating the official starting of the world's most accurate timepiece, the San Francisco Beryllium Atomic Clock. How are we gonna get that on the back of a bike? No, no, we only need the tiniest part of it. People are starting to stare. Why don't we just make conversation? So, time travel's possible? Anything's possible. Why don't you have the ability to transform yourself into another species like the... Well, I do, you see, but only when I die. And that rival Time Lord, The Master? He's on his last life, fighting to survive. And the science has shown us over and over, in the fight for survival there are no rules. Also, Grace, if I tell you a secret, you must promise not to tell. Professor Wagg. This is Doctor Bowman. He's from London. He was just going to share a secret with us. Yes. Er, Professor, is there a chance of a closer look at the clock? No! No, I'm afraid that I am the only person allowed up there. Oh, can't you just bend the rules a little? No. - Oh, but you see... - Grace says you have a big secret. What is it? I'm half-human. On my mother's side. Very clever. Happy new year. Yes, I think you must be. - Champagne? - Oh! - Grace... - Oh. This is when I wish I had my sonic screwdriver. What? You see? I told you it was small. - What is it they say? - Yes, they say that on my planet, too. - I know you. - You do, huh? Gareth, answer the second question on you mid-term exam, not the third. The third may look easier, but you'll mess it up. What? Remember, answer the second question. Don't forget! I won't. Now can I see what's in your hand, sir? Mmm... What was that all about? Ten years from now, Gareth will head the Seismology unit of the UCLA Task Force and devise a system for accurately predicting earthquakes. - You mean that, don't you? - Of course! His inventions save the human race several times, but first he must graduate in poetry. Look! There's the kid who took your stuff. You see who he's with? Come on. The Master? You're lucky he only got your wrist. - Why'd you do that? - Liven things up. Come on! Door! You're not afraid of heights, are you? - Yeah. - So am I. Everyone, stay calm! Remain inside! Don't panic! Everything is under control. You go upstairs, I'll seal the exits. Doctor! Here we go again. So, do you know what's going happen to me? You don't want to know! Right. You can't not tell me! - Grace. - Oh, God. Brian's gonna move in again! I can't say! Please? The universe hangs by such a delicate thread of coincidences. It's useless to meddle with it, unless, like me, you're a Time Lord. All right. So just give me few pointers. - There she is. - A police box? - Key. - Now I always leave a spare key... ...in a secret compartment above the door. Great minds thing alike. Up you go. It's in a cubbyhole above the P. Got it. Why a police box? Its cloaking device got stuck on a previous misadventure, but I like it like this. Doctor. I've got no brakes! Oh, my. - Wow! - Do you hear that? - Yeah. - That's a warning. The TARDIS is dying. - This is amazing. - It's no good. We don't even have enough auxiliary power to move next door. The beryllium chip, Grace. - Yes, Doctor. - Careful! Yes, Doctor. - This looks pretty low-tech. - "Low-tech"? Grace, this is a Type 40 TARDIS, able to take you to any planet in the Universe and to any date in that planet's existence. Temporal physics. Oh, you mean like interdimensional transference. That would explain the spatial displacement we experienced as we passed over the threshold. Yes, if you like. Yes! There! The Eye is closing. Now, let's see. Come on. Come on. - Oh, no. - What? I have a horrible feeling we're already too late. - It's 11:48. We still have eleven minutes. - There is no context. Hold on. What are you doing? I'm setting coordinates for one minute after midnight. - Why? - If this is true, the Eye has been open too long and there is no future. I only hope... Oh, no! Is this thing reliable? Whatever's happening can't be stopped by closing the Eye. - Well, how come you didn't know that? - I haven't opened the Eye before. Now you tell me. Grace, closing the Eye may not be enough. We have to go back to before the Eye was opened. - Maybe even before we arrived. - This is a time machine. - With no power. - What? The Eye being open so long must have drained the TARDIS. - Great! - I'm sorry. You must have the power to get back. You must! - Not enough! - What about all those glorious predictions? All that knowledge about what's going to happen to Gareth, to me, to this city? That must come from somewhere. Think! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! Are you any good at setting alarm clocks? - No! - Grace! - I'll try. OK. - Listen very carefully... We pre-set the coordinates just as I divert the power from within the Eye itself into the time rotor here. - We jump-start the TARDIS? - We jump-start the TARDIS! What do I do? Hit the top switch on the console there. The top one. Good. Now pass me the neutron ram. Grace? Grace, the neutron ram. Look, I'll show you. Oh, no. Oh, not you, Grace. This is no time to play doctors and nurses. It's no good talking to her. She's possessed. You. You took my things. Where are they? They're not your things anymore. Pretty soon, everything around here's going to belong to the Master again. "Again"? What's he been telling you? When he gets his body back from you, I'm going to be rich. And you believe him? Why shouldn't I? I suppose he neglected to mention that there won't be any place to spend your money? Which is why we have no time to waste. But time to change. I always dress for the occasion. Well, I'm glad to see that you are aware of the gravity of the situation. I never liked this planet, Doctor. Well, that's good, because any minute now it shall cease to exist. What's the time? Time enough for me to get my body, get out of here, and take Lee with me. Lee is the son I have always yearned for. Oh, please! Grace. Put it on him. I suspect you know how. Lee, this is my TARDIS. This is my Eye and I'm in my own body. The Master has run out of all his lives, now he plans to steal mine. That's the truth! Look at Grace! She's possessed by evil, not goodness. This won't hurt, much. I didn't think I would make it. Hey, baby. Hey, Pete! My life's work. Om. Om. In 700 years no one has managed to open the Eye. How did you do it? Simple. Lee is human and you are only half. Lee, open the Eye for me, please. Mr Wagg! Ladies and gentlemen, in three minutes the world will enter a new millennium, and with it a new standard of accuracy will come to how we measure time. What do you mean, it won't start? Lee, this is your last chance! This is my only chance. He's right, Doctor. There's nothing for him here. No family, no gangs, only death. But with me, he gets see the Universe. This is his last chance to stay alive, and you know it. What do you know of last chances? More than you! I have wasted all my lives because of you, Doctor, and I will be rid of you. All your lives! Didn't you tell Lee I'd stolen your lives? Lee, he's lying. He's used all his lives, now he wants mine. Like I told you, this is my TARDIS, this my body. Don't believe him. Open the Eye. He said it himself, Lee. He's wasted his lives, all of them. - Open the Eye. - No! You lied to me! Lee. Lee. I would never lie to you. I would only protect you. No! How will you open the Eye now? Grace, come here. Unless I'm mistaken, in her present state of mind, that won't work! Her eyes aren't human anymore. Watch... See? Now they're human. No! Grace, close your eyes! Too late! I'm blind! Your sight will return, Grace! What's happening? He can't move so long as the Eye links us. Remember, Grace! Remember! Reroute the power! In the console room, go! But you'll die if I leave you! We'll all die if you don't! Run! Run, Grace! I'm taking your lives, Doctor. Run! I can hear your thoughts, Doctor. I can feel your memories. Oh. Oh. This can't be how it ends. Stop this. Please. Stop! God, please! Oh, what have I done? Thirty seconds! 29, 28, 27, 26, 25... 20, 19, 18... 17, 16, 15... 12, 11, 10... And I thought surgery was difficult. Nine... Eight... Rerouting the power. I'm alive. - Seven. - Any minute now. Six... I'm alive. I'm alive! - That's all the time we have... - Three... I am alive! One! We have to go back to before the Eye was opened, maybe even before we arrived! Alarm clock, alarm clock, think alarm clock! "Temporal orbit"? What's a "temporal orbit"? She did it. Your life force is dying, Master. No! We're in temporal orbit, Doctor. What is it? What is that? Grace! No! Grace... You are my life. You want dominion over the living, yet all you do is kill! Life is wasted on the living! Give me your hand! Never! Doctor! Doctor, I have your things. Hello, Grace. Well, how does it feel to hold back death? Incredible. Did you see that? What a sentimental old thing this TARDIS is. Well, congratulations. You've both been somewhere I've never been. - It's nothing to be scared of, Doctor. - Oh, glad to hear it. Did we go back far enough? Either that or I'm talking to a couple of ghosts and I don't believe in ghosts. So, uh, where's the Master? Indigestion. So, let's see where we are. There. The future. Wow... Look over there, on the other side of your galaxy. That's home. Gallifrey. Two hundred and fifty million light years away. Phew. That's a good ten minutes in this old thing. So, where are we? December 29th. Do you want to get off here? I don't think I could live through that again. I definitely wouldn't live through that again. Reason enough. That's not funny! Eleven, ten... Nine, eight, seven... Six, five... Four, three, two, one! Have a happy new year... Happy new year. Happy... Can you believe it? 2000. Now, that's as it should be. Your things. - My sonic screwdriver. Thank you! - And, uh, these, too. Please, keep them. - Really? - Yes, really. I'd better go before you change your mind. Lee! Next Christmas, take a vacation. Just don't be here. Right, thanks! Thanks, Doctor! See you around, Grace! Happy New Year! There you go, interfering again. Grace, something you should know... - Don't tell me. - Why not? I know who I am. And that's enough. I'm glad. Come with me. You come with me. - Me come with you? - Yes. Me come with you? It's tempting. I'm going to miss you. How can you miss me? I'm easy to find. I'm the guy with two hearts, remember? That's not what I meant. - Thank you, Doctor. - No, no. Thank you, Doctor! Bye. Sounds better. Right, where to next? Where was I? Oh, no, not again!
