- ( breathing heavily ) - LOCKING ONTO THE GAMILAS BATTLESHIP. HOW MUCH LONGER? - Aihara: FIFTEEN SECONDS 'TIL WE'RE CLEAR. KEEP THEM BUSY! - ALL UNITS, CLEAR CANNON TRAJECTORY AT ONCE. - YES, SIR. MOVING ASIDE. - LET THE ENEMY COME IN CLOSER. - FIVE SECONDS! FOUR, THREE, TWO, ONE. - ALL SHOCK-CANNONS, FIRE AT WILL. - ANY DAMAGE? - THEY SURVIVED THE ATTACK. OUR INTEL MUST BE OUTDATED. - IT WAS THE NEWEST DATA WE'VE GOT. THEY TOOK OUR BOMBARDMENT LIKE IT WAS NOTHING. - ( exclaims ) AFT HULL DAMAGED. CAPTAIN, WE'RE LOSING THRUST. - ( screaming ) - THE GAMILAS SHIPS ARE PREPARING FOR ANOTHER BARRAGE. - CAPTAIN, THE FUZUYUKI! - OUR HULL DAMAGE IS ALREADY AT CRITICAL. - IT'S BEEN DESTROYED. - ALL HANDS WERE LOST! REPEAT, ALL HANDS LOST! - ( screams ) - COME ON, WE GOTTA PUT THIS OUT. - I'M ON IT. - THERE'S NOT A SHIP IN THE FLEET, THAT CAN DESTROY THE FOE WE NOW FACE. - INCOMING MESSAGE. IT'S THE YUKIKAZE. - CAPTAIN, WE'RE IN A BAD WAY HERE. RETREAT WHILE YOU CAN. I'LL BUY YOU SOME TIME. - KODAI, DON'T BE SUCH A FOOL. - IF I CAN HELP YOU ESCAPE, I WANT TO. - DON'T THROW YOUR LIFE AWAY FOR AN OLD MAN LIKE ME. - CAPTAIN OKITA, I'M HONORED TO HAVE FOUGHT AT YOUR SIDE. HOPE I DID YOU PROUD. SANADA, GIVE 'EM HELL. - KODAI, WAIT! - KODAI. - Narrator: THE EDGES OF SPACE REACH OUT INTO INFINITY. IT IS A REALM OF SILENCE, AND LIGHT. OLD STARS PERISH, WHILE OTHERS ARE BORN ANEW. AND THUS, THE LIVING UNIVERSE ENDURES. BUT IT IS IN THIS MOMENT, THIS GRAIN IN THE DESERT OF TIME, THAT ONE PLANET MUST FACE ITS GREATEST PERIL. IN 2194, AN UNKNOWN FOE APPEARED WITHIN OUR SOLAR SYSTEM IN THE SPACE OFF OF MARS. THEY ATTACKED WITHOUT PROVOCATION, RAINING THE FIRST OF MANY METEORITE BOMBS DOWN UPON THE EARTH. IT IS NOW 2199, FIVE LONG YEARS LATER. OUR ONCE BEAUTIFUL PLANET HAS BEEN CRIPPLED WITH RADIATION FROM THE ATTACKS. WHAT REMAINS OF HUMANITY STANDS ON THE EDGE OF EXTINCTION. PEOPLE HAVE ABANDONED THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH, SCRAPING OUT A DESPERATE SURVIVAL UNDERGROUND. DEVOID OF HOPE, MANKIND SITS IN THE DARKNESS, WAITING FOR THE END. - I KNOW WHAT YOU ARE. YOU'RE ONE OF THEM IDIOT SCAVENGERS. YOU BUST YOUR ASS TO FIND SCRAP METAL, GIVE IT TO THE DEFENSE FORCE. LIKE IT'LL DO US ANY GOOD. EARTH IS DONE FOR. STOP FOOLING YOURSELF. - SAVE YOUR BREATH, MAN. HE'S GOT A HOOK-UP. HIS BROTHER IN THE MILITARY, TRADES HIM SOME PRETTY SWEET STUFF FOR THAT SCRAP METAL. HE GIVES HIM DRUGS AND ALCOHOL. - IS THAT RIGHT? YOUR BRO'S MILITARY? - OFFICER, YEAH. SECRET'S OUT. YOU TRADE RARE METALS FOR THE GOOD STUFF, MAN. - SO THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE UP TO. SORRY I BUSTED YOUR BALLS. HEY, YOU SHOULD INTRODUCE ME TO THAT BROTHER... THE HELL'S YOUR PROBLEM? ( groans ) - ( rumbling ) - Analyzer: I AM PICKING UP LITHIUM, FIFTY CENTIMETERS BELOW THE SURFACE. RADIATION DENSITY OF OBJECT, FOURTEEN SIEVERTS. THAT IS TWICE THE FATAL AMOUNT. YOU WILL DIE. - TELL ME SOMETHING I DON'T KNOW, ANALYZER. - SORRY. FLYING PROJECTILE INCOMING. AVOID POINT OF IMPACT. - ( screaming ) ( gasping ) ( gasping continues ) - THIS IS IT, SIR. THE CAPSULE THAT CRASH-LANDED. - ( electronic buzzing ) - Okita: SO, WHAT'RE WE LOOKING AT? - IT'S LIKE A SCHEMATIC OF SOME TYPE. - WHO BROUGHT IT IN? - A CIVILIAN LOOKING FOR METAL TO SALVAGE. - TOOK A LETHAL DOSE OF RADIATION WHEN THE FORCE OF THE IMPACT KNOCKED OFF HIS MASK. THEY'RE SCRUBBING HIM DOWN AS PER PROTOCOL. THAT SAID, THE ODDS OF HIM SURVIVING ARE SLIM. - Susumu: OKITA! - Man 1: YOU CAN'T GO IN THERE. - Man 2: STAY BACK. - Susumu: I WANNA SEE HIM. - THIS AREA'S OFF-LIMITS. - Susumu: OKITA! - THEN AGAIN, MAYBE NOT. - WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU? - GET HIM OUT OF HERE! HE'S HIGHLY TOXIC. HE'LL CONTAMINATE THE SHIP. - HEY, OLD MAN! YOU OKITA? - IF I AM? - YOU LET THE YUKIKAZE TAKE THE ATTACK, WHILE YOU RAN OFF TO LIVE ANOTHER DAY. RIGHT? - ANSWER ME! - KODAI! THAT'S ENOUGH! - WHO ARE YOU? - MY BROTHER MAMORU WAS THE CAPTAIN OF THE YUKIKAZE. - SO YOU'RE SUSUMU? - YOU USED MY BROTHER AS A SHIELD. YOU LET THEM DIE SO YOU COULD RUN HOME WITH YOUR TAIL BETWEEN YOUR LEGS, DIDN'T YOU? HOW DO YOU SLEEP AT NIGHT? - LIKE A BABY. SHOULDN'T I? - ( laughs ) YOU HAD THIS COMING. - WELL, AT LEAST HE WAS THERE. - SO SAYS HIS GUARD DOG. - YUKI MORI? - YOU KNOW WHAT? IT'S EASY TO JUDGE WHEN YOU'RE BACK ON EARTH. WE'RE FIGHTING A WAR OUT THERE. YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT BETTER THAN ANYONE. - GIVE ME A REASON. - TOUGH GUY, HUH? PUT THE GUN DOWN! WE'LL SEE HOW TOUGH YOU ARE! - SHUT UP! - KODAI! SOMEBODY HAD TO MAKE IT BACK HERE ALIVE. - ( groans ) - SAITO, STOP ROUGHING HIM UP! HE'S ALREADY INJURED! - Susumu: SCREW YOU! - SHUT UP! - CAPTAIN OKITA, I'M VERY SORRY. I DIDN'T THINK HE'D REACT LIKE THAT. YOU SEE, I TOLD HIM THE DETAILS OF HOW HIS BROTHER DIED. THE NEXT THING I KNOW, HE'S YELLING AND... - DR. SADO, IT'S ALL RIGHT. - THANK YOU, CAPTAIN. - THAT MAN, HOW IS HE STILL ALIVE AFTER ALL THE RADIATION HE TOOK? - FRANKLY, I HAVE NO IDEA. - THEY HIT YOU HARD, DIDN'T THEY, CAPTAIN? - WIPED US OUT. WE NEVER HAD A CHANCE. WE HIT THE GAMILAS WITH EVERYTHING WE HAD TO NO AVAIL. - WE STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY WANT OR EVEN WHO THEY ARE. - THEY WANT US DEAD. AND WITH EVERY BATTLE WE FIGHT, IT GETS HARDER. THEY LEARN OUR TACTICS. - IT'S THEIR MOVE, AND SOON THEY'LL PUT THE EARTH INTO CHECKMATE. AND SO, THE TIME HAS COME TO ABANDON OUR HOME AND FLEE WITH A CHOSEN FEW. - THIS IS OUR GREATEST SHIP. WHICH IS WHY I'M ASKING FOR IT. - WHAT DID YOU SAY? - DON'T USE IT TO GRANT THE ELITE A FEW MORE DAYS OF LIFE THAN THOSE THEY LEAVE BEHIND. GIVE ME PERMISSION TO TAKE THE SHIP ON A VOYAGE OF HOPE. GIVE HUMANITY SOMETHING TO BELIEVE IN. A STAKE IN THEIR OWN FATE. TO KNOW WE GAVE IT OUR ALL. LET THEM DIE ON THEIR FEET. - AND WHAT STORY WOULD YOU HAVE ME TELL THEM, OKITA? WHAT HOPE IS THERE? PEOPLE OF THE NATION OF JAPAN, AND ALL OF THE NATIONS OF THE EARTH. I COME TO YOU WITH AN ANNOUNCEMENT CONCERNING THE FUTURE OF MANKIND. I HOPE THAT YOU WILL TAKE IT WITH EQUANIMITY. RECENTLY, A CAPSULE OF ALIEN ORIGIN CRASH-LANDED OFF CAPE BONOMISAKI. ANALYSIS OF THE CAPSULE HAS YIELDED A MESSAGE OF GRAVE IMPORTANCE TO ALL HUMANITY. THIS, WE BELIEVE, IS A REPRESENTATION OF OUR SOLAR SYSTEM, WHICH MEANS THIS IS OSTENSIBLY OUR GALAXY, THE MILKY WAY. THE MESSAGE CAME FROM A GALAXY ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY THOUSAND LIGHT-YEARS AWAY, KNOWN AS THE LARGE MAGELLANIC CLOUD. FROM A PLANET THEY CALL ISKANDAR. THEY WOULD LIKE TO PROVIDE US WITH A DEVICE OF THEIR MAKING, THAT ELIMINATES RADIATION RESTORING EARTH TO ITS FORMER GLORY. TO THAT END, WE HAVE MADE THE DECISION TO SEND OUR FINAL SPACE BATTLESHIP, TO GO AND RETRIEVE THAT DEVICE. - CAN ONE OF OUR SHIPS GO THAT FAR? - COULD IT HAVE BEEN SENT BY THE GAMILAS? - COMMANDER, HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE IT GET THERE? - TO ANSWER THAT SPECIFICALLY WOULD BE A DANGEROUS BREACH OF MILITARY INTELLIGENCE. THANKFULLY, OUR BENEFACTORS HAVE PROVIDED US WITH TECHNOLOGY WHICH ALLOWS ONE TO MAKE THE JOURNEY QUICKLY. - YOU'RE GAMBLING WITH OUR FUTURE! - COMMANDER! - THAT DOESN'T GIVE US MUCH TO GO ON. - HOW CAN YOU BE CERTAIN THE SHIP'LL GET BACK IN TIME? - SHOULDN'T THE PUBLIC HAVE A SAY IN THIS DECISION? - WE ARE NOT PUTTING THIS TO A VOTE. THERE'S NO TIME. THE PLANET IS IN PERIL, AND I'LL BE DAMNED IF WE MEET OUR END BECAUSE WE TALKED OURSELVES IN CIRCLES INSTEAD OF ACTING. AS OF TODAY, OUR SCIENTISTS PREDICT THAT HUMANITY WILL BE EXTINCT WITHIN A YEAR. AND MAYBE SOONER. SOME ARE SAYING WE ONLY HAVE MONTHS. IF WE DON'T ACCEPT ISKANDAR'S OFFER, OUR PLANET WILL DIE. THIS VOYAGE IS OUR LAST HOPE. PEOPLE OF THE EARTH, IF WE OBTAIN THIS MIRACULOUS DEVICE, WE CAN RECLAIM OUR BIRTHRIGHT AS HUMAN BEINGS, LEAVE THE TUNNELS, AND LIVE WITHOUT FEAR ON THE SURFACE OF THE PLANET. THIS IS OUR DARKEST HOUR, MAKE NO MISTAKE. BUT WE CAN'T STAND IDLY BY AND LET THE GAMILAS FINISH BOMBING US INTO OBLIVION. WE HAVE BEEN GIVEN THIS LAST CHANCE, AND WE WILL TAKE IT. THROUGH OUR VALOR AND OUR RESOLVE, MANKIND WILL REWRITE ITS OWN DESTINY. REMEMBER OUR BEAUTIFUL, VERDANT EARTH. IF WE CAN LOOK TO THE SKIES WITH COURAGE, THIS ONE LAST TIME, IT CAN BE OURS ONCE AGAIN. TO THIS END, WE'RE ACCEPTING VOLUNTEERS WITH EXPERIENCE IN DEEP SPACE OR THE MILITARY. IF YOU HAVE THESE SKILLS, I URGE YOU TO CONSIDER - ENLISTING FOR THIS MOMENTOUS VOYAGE. - JUST STAY PATIENT, FOLKS. WE'LL GET TO ALL OF YOU EVENTUALLY. - Sado: IT LOOKS LIKE YOUR PAPERWORK CHECKS OUT, SO, WELCOME ABOARD. MECHANIC, HUH? YOU GET THE WHITE AND BLUE SUIT. HERE. - SUSUMU KODAI. - HOW ARE YOU ALIVE? - HUH? - I DON'T BELIEVE IT. YOU SHOULD HAVE DIED DAYS AGO. EYES LOOK NORMAL. OPEN YOUR MOUTH? - DOCTOR, THERE'S KIND OF A LINE, YOU KNOW? - OH. YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT. SAYS HERE YOU HAVE EXPERIENCE LEADING A... IS THIS A JOKE? YOU LED A FIGHTER SQUADRON? - I LEFT THE SERVICE, BUT NOW I'D LIKE TO RE-ENLIST. OH, AND YOU CAN HANG ONTO THAT. I'M KINDA PARTIAL TO MY OLD ONE. - ( cat mewing ) - GOOD KITTY. - HOLD ON A SECOND! WHY ARE YOU HERE? - WHY NOT? - YOU TRIED TO ASSAULT THE CAPTAIN. - YEAH, AND? - WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM? - BACK OFF! - WHAT'RE YOU TRYING TO PULL, KODAI? - NOTHING, OKAY? - ( alarm sounding ) - RED ALERT. ALL HANDS REPORT TO BATTLE STATIONS. - RED ALERT. ALL HANDS REPORT TO... - ASSEMBLE THE BLACK TIGERS. I'M HEADING TO BRIDGE NUMBER ONE. - YOU CAN'T ORDER ME AROUND. - AS OF MY RE-ENLISTING, I'M YOUR SQUADRON LEADER. GO OUT THERE AND SHOW ME WHAT YOU GOT. - Todo: OUR SENSORS JUST PICKED UP THE SIGNATURE OF A GAMILAS MISSILE. IT'S HEADED STRAIGHT FOR YOUR COORDINATES. IT'S TARGETING THE SHIP. AND OUR GUNS CAN'T DESTROY IT. - PREPARE TO LAUNCH. SHIMA, READY THE WAVE ENGINE. - SHIMA? - ROGER. - NICE AND EASY. ATTA GIRL. - ( rumbling ) - I'M ON THE... - THAT'S RIGHT. THE YAMATO. YAMATO, LIFT OFF. - YAMATO LIFTING OFF. YES, SIR. - Aihara: FIFTEEN HUNDRED KILOMETERS, SIR. - TOO LATE TO GET AWAY. - SANADA. - SIR! - PREPARE THE WAVE-MOTION GUN FOR USE. TARGET, THE GAMILAS MISSILE. - BUT THE WAVE-MOTION GUN HASN'T BEEN TESTED. - WILL IT WORK? - YES. I THINK SO, BUT I CAN'T BE SURE. - IF IT FAILS, HUMANITY IS DONE FOR. THAT WON'T OCCUR ON MY WATCH. - I UNDERSTAND. KODAI? - SIR? - HAVE YOU READ THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE GUN? - YES, SIR. KINDA. BUT IT'S ALIEN TECH I'VE NEVER USED BEFORE, SO I CAN'T VOUCH FOR IT. - NO TIME FOR MAYBE. IT'S DO OR DIE. - TWELVE HUNDRED KILOMETERS. - RAISE WAVE-MOTION ENGINE PRESSURE. - SAFETY VALVES TO SHUT. - AYE-AYE. RAISING ENGINE PRESSURE. CLOSING ALL SAFETY VALVES. - OPEN UP THE MOTION CHAMBER. - AYE-AYE. UNDERWAY. - PRESSURE WITHIN CHAMBER RISING STEADILY. - ALL AVAILABLE POWER ROUTED TO GUN. READY THE FORCED INDUCTION AND GO. - YES, SIR. INITIATING. - PREPARE TO FIRE. SHIMA, GIVE KODAI THE CONTROLS. - KODAI, IT'S ALL YOU. - ( exclaiming ) - SORRY 'BOUT THAT. - KODAI, DISENGAGE THE SAFETY. - DISENGAGING, CAPTAIN. LOCKS ARE AT ZERO. PRESSURE APPROACHING FIRING POINT. OVERRIDING FAIL-SAFES. - YAMATO IS NOW ALIGNED TO THE MISSILE'S TRAJECTORY. - MAKE SURE THAT IT'S DEAD ON. TARGETING SCOPE, OPEN. CONTRAST GAUGE SET AT TWENTY. GAMILAS MISSILE IN MY SIGHTS. - ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY KILOMETERS. - ENERGY BUILD-UP AT ONE HUNDRED PERCENT. - WAIT FOR IT. - ENERGY BUILD-UP AT ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY PERCENT. - THE CHAMBER IS AT ITS LIMIT, CAPTAIN. - BRIDGE CREW, READY TO FIRE. BRACE FOR THE FLASH AND RECOIL. - SEVENTY KILOMETERS. WE'RE OUT OF TIME. - FIVE, FOUR, THREE, TWO, ONE, ZERO. FIRE! - COMMANDER, OUR SYSTEMS ARE DOWN. - BRING US ONLINE. - BACK-UP IMAGING FEED INCOMING. - WHERE IS THE SHIP? - UNSURE. I CAN'T TELL. - WAS IT VAPORIZED? - COMMANDER. YAMATO SURVIVED! - THEY DID IT. THEY ACTUALLY SURVIVED THAT. - WE JUST SHOWED THEM OUR HAND. WE WON'T BE ABLE TO SURPRISE THE GAMILAS WITH THAT WEAPONRY AGAIN. - YOU DID WHAT YOU HAD TO DO TO PROTECT YOUR SHIP. THAT'S ONE HELL OF A CHRISTENING SHE GOT. ARE YOU READY TO EMBARK? - YES. I WANT TO LEAVE THE SOLAR SYSTEM BEFORE THE GAMILAS HAVE TIME TO TRY IT AGAIN. - UNDERSTOOD. YAMATO. GO WITH GOD! - THERE AND BACK. TWENTY FOUR HOURS FROM NOW, WE TEST THE WARP DRIVE. - All: ROGER! - HELL OF A FIRST DAY YOU HAD, HUH? - YOU'LL HAVE YOUR FUN TOMORROW, WHEN IT'S WARP TIME. ( chuckles ) IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU HERE, BUT I'M SURPRISED, YOU KNOW? - WELL, SHE IS OUR LAST SHIP. I DID IT FOR JIRO, TOO. - JIRO. HOW OLD IS HE NOW? - FIVE YEARS OLD. - NO KIDDING. HUH. HE'S GROWING UP. RIGHT ON. - HEY, KODAI! - KATO. YAMAMOTO. NO WAY. - TURNS OUT, WE ALL GOT POSTED HERE TODAY. WHEN WE HEARD YOU WERE BACK IN THE SERVICE, WE JUMPED AT THE CHANCE! RIGHT? - YOU KNOW IT. - YES, SIR. - FURUYA. - HEY, WHAT'S UP? - WHAT DID I SAY ABOUT HIDING BACK THERE? - I WASN'T HIDING, I WAS JUST... - ONE OF THESE DAYS I'LL CURE YOU OF THAT. - HE GOT YA, FURUYA. - YEAH. CUT THAT OUT, MAN. - TEAM KODAI, REPORTING IN FOR DUTY. REQUESTING CHANCE TO REJOIN YOUR SQUADRON. - THE TEAM'S STILL NAMED AFTER ME? - YEAH, IT'S EVEN ON THE JACKETS. - LOOK AT THOSE CORNY PATCHES THEY GOT. WHAT THE... - ( all laughing ) - WE BROUGHT A LITTLE SOMETHING ALONG. YOU DON'T WANNA TOAST OUR REUNION WITH WATER, RIGHT? - I GUESS WE GOTTA. ALL RIGHT, YOU SLACKERS. - THIS IS SO EXCITING! - TAKE A SEAT. WE'RE GONNA DO THIS PROPER. - Yukimori: WANNA TELL YOUR FAN CLUB TO PUT A SOCK IN IT? CAN BARELY HEAR MYSELF THINK. - COME ON. - WHY ARE YOU GETTING ON OUR CASE? - IF YOU WANNA BE ALONE, THE MESS HALL'S THE WRONG PLACE FOR IT. I HAVEN'T SEEN ANY OF THESE GUYS IN YEARS. I DON'T SEE WHAT THE PROBLEM IS IF WE GET A LITTLE FEISTY. - OF COURSE YOU DON'T. TEAM KODAI CAN DO NO WRONG. CUE AN EVENING OF YOU RELIVING YOUR DUSTY OLD GLORY DAYS. - WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM? - HEY, NOW. YOU USED TO BE PART OF THE TEAM, BACK IN THE DAY. - YOU WERE A ROOKIE, WITH HUGE DIAPERS, TO MATCH THE SIZE OF YOUR HEAD. - ( all laughing ) - YOU'RE GRUMPY 'CAUSE I'M GONNA BEAT YOUR RECORD. I UNDERSTAND. - OH, KODAI, SO NICE OF YOU TO JOIN US AGAIN. - WHY'D IT TAKE YOU SO DAMN LONG? - WHAT DO YOU CARE? - YOUR OWN BROTHER WAS KILLED IN BATTLE. OUR FLEET WAS ALL BUT DESTROYED. WHILE WE FOUGHT AND DIED IN SPACE, YOU WERE SAFE ON EARTH, PICKING THROUGH SCRAP METAL. YOU GOT SCARED. AND SO YOU RAN AWAY, DIDN'T YOU? WHAT I CAN'T STOMACH, IS THE THOUGHT OF THE GREAT SUSUMU KODAI SO BEATEN AS A PILOT AND A MAN, THAT HE'D RUN. - THAT DOES IT! - WHAT THE HELL WERE YOU THINKING? DUMBASS. - ATTENTION, CREW. WHEN THE YAMATO REACHES THE ORBIT OF THE PLANET MARS, WE WILL CONDUCT HUMANITY'S FIRST ATTEMPT AT WARP TRAVEL. IF WE FAIL, WE WILL DIE, AND ALL MANKIND WILL FACE DESTRUCTION. KEEP THAT IN MIND AS YOU FOCUS ON YOUR DUTIES. THAT IS ALL. - Woman on PA: ALL HANDS, STAND BY FOR WARP. - EXCUSE ME. WHAT'S HAPPENING? - WE'RE GONNA GO FASTER THAN ANYONE EVER. SEE YA. - HEY, AKAGI. - YEAH? - GET ME PREPPED. - ON IT! BT1, ON DECK! - ROGER! - ROGER! - LIKE SITTIN' IN A COCKPIT'S GONNA HELP IF THE WARP GOES BAD. - SAVE IT. YOU'RE WASTING YOUR BREATH. - WARP! - WARPING, CAPTAIN! - ( engine whizzing ) - WE'RE ALIVE, BUT DID IT WORK? - HEY. LOOK AT THAT. - NO DAMAGE TO THE HULL, SIR. - THERE'S NO GRAVITY FIELD. IT'S ALL CLEAR AHEAD OF US. - WARP WAS SUCCESSFUL. - ALL RIGHT. YEAH. KODAI, WE MADE HISTORY. - THAT WAS INCREDIBLE. - THIS IS SOME SHIP! - RE-EMBARKING ON PRIOR COURSE. - KODAI! ( chuckling ) - ( sighs ) HOLD ON. AIHARA, CHECK OUT OUR ONE O' CLOCK. - GAMILAS SQUADRON. - DAMN IT! WHY'D YOU DROP US OUT HERE? - HOW WAS I SUPPOSED TO KNOW? - MAYBE THEY TRACKED OUR WARP ENERGY OUTPUT. - ALL HANDS REPORT TO BATTLE STATIONS. READY THE GUN! - RIGHT AWAY! - Sanada: PROBLEM. WE CAN'T USE THE WAVE-MOTION GUN AFTER WARPING. THEY BOTH DRAW FROM THE SAME POWER SOURCE. - DAMN IT! - Okita: SO BE IT. CHIEF TOKUGAWA, HOW LONG 'TIL WE CAN WARP AGAIN? - OUR ENERGY'S DEPLETED. TWENTY MINUTES, AT LEAST. - AIHARA, CAN YOU PINPOINT OUR DESTINATION IN TWENTY MINUTES? - DEFINITELY, CAPTAIN. - KODAI. - SIR! - CRIPPLE THE GAMILAS WARP ENGINES SO THEY CAN'T FOLLOW US. - ROGER THAT. BLACK TIGERS, IT'S KODAI. TARGET THE ENEMY WARP ENGINES. - YA READY TO ROLL? - All: READY! - Yuki Mori: SORRY, GUYS. TOO SLOW. - DAMN IT, SHE BEAT US TO THE PUNCH! - GUESS SITTIN' IN HER FIGHTER WAS PRETTY SMART. - ( grunts ) - IF YOU'RE TRYING TO SHOW OFF, CUT IT OUT. - GUESS AGAIN, FEARLESS LEADER. THIS IS HOW I SURVIVED THE FIGHT OFF OF MARS. - WE WARP IN TWENTY MINUTES. TRY NOT TO BE LATE. - ROGER THAT. - ( missiles firing ) - ( grunts ) YOU LIKE THAT? - LOOK AT YOU. - ( grunts ) - NO WORRIES, HOT-SHOT. WE GOT YOUR BACK. - ALL RIGHT, BLACK TIGERS. WHAT DO YOU SAY WE HONE IN ON THAT GAMILAS MOTHER SHIP? - WORKS FOR ME. TARGETS PAINTED, KODAI! - READY THE CANNONS. - CANNONS AT THE READY! - JACKPOT! - ALL RIGHT! - CHECK IT OUT! - WOW.

WE'RE ALMOST READY. - SHIMA, HOW MUCH LONGER? - WE'LL HAVE ENOUGH ENERGY TO WARP IN, FIVE MINUTES. - AIHARA, HAVE YOU FOUND SOMEWHERE SAFE FOR US TO GO? - ALMOST, SIR. - SIR, IT'S KATO. THERE'S NO SIGN OF MORI OUT HERE. WE CAN'T RAISE HER OVER THE COMMS. - Susumu: WHAT? BT1, COME IN.

OXYGEN SUPPLY REACHING CRITICAL LEVELS. SUFFOCATION IMMINENT. - ENEMY DEBRIS TOOK OUT MY ENGINE. - YOU'RE DEAD IN THE AIR? - LEAVE ME BEHIND. YOU DON'T HAVE A CHOICE. - DON'T BE STUPID. I'M ON MY WAY. - Shima: SUSUMU, THERE'S NO TIME. - KODAI. RETURN TO YOUR POST. - AND LEAVE HER BEHIND TO DIE, LIKE MY BROTHER? I'LL BE BACK IN TIME. WE BOTH WILL. - NANBU, YOU'RE ON THE GUN. - YES, SIR. - DAMNED FOOL. SHIMA, AIHARA. CONTINUE PREPARING FOR WARP. - BUT, SIR... - AIHARA, CALL OUT ENEMY COORDINATES AS THEY MOVE. - YES, SIR. - Kato: WHAT'S HE DOING? - WE'LL HAVE WARP FUNCTIONALITY IN TWO MINUTES. - EMERGENCE POINT HAS BEEN CONFIRMED. - COORDINATES, CLEAR OF OBSTRUCTIONS. CAPTAIN. - IT'S ALL RIGHT. IT ISN'T GOING TO HURT. SO DON'T BE AFRAID. I'M JUST GOING TO SLEEP, THAT'S ALL. - Susumu: HEY YUKI, IS YOUR EJECTION BOOSTER ONLINE? COME ON, YUKI. TALK TO ME. - GO BACK TO THE SHIP! THE TEAM NEEDS TO GET BACK TO SAFETY. - ANSWER THE QUESTION. CAN YOU EJECT OUT OF THERE? - I THINK SO. - ATTAGIRL. ON MY MARK, YOU PUNCH OUT OKAY. - FIVE GAMILAS BOGEYS CLOSING IN ON OUR NINE O' CLOCK. - ENGAGE. - SIR! - DAMAGED HULL ON THE PORT SIDE AFT. - SUB-NOZZLE'S NON-OPERATIONAL. - THEY RAMMED US? - WITHOUT THE MOTHER SHIP, THEY ARE ALREADY DEAD. - Aihara: GAMILAS INBOUND. - HOW MANY? - AT LEAST TWO DOZEN. IT'S A WHOLE SQUADRON. - CUTTING IT CLOSE. GET READY. I'M COMING UP BEHIND YOU. - ONE SHOT. - NOW! - RECHARGING OF WARP CAPABILITY IS DONE. - GAMILAS FIGHTER SQUADRON STILL SET ON COLLISION COURSE. KODAI IS INBOUND, PORT SIDE. - SHIMA. DON'T THINK OF THOSE FIGHTERS AS SHIPS WITH PILOTS. THEY'RE NOTHING MORE THAN A BARRAGE OF MISSILES NOW. YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO. - ROGER! - CREW, THIS IS THE CAPTAIN. BRACE FOR LATERAL Gs. WE WILL ROLL TO AVOID THE GAMILAS BLITZ, ALLOWING KODAI TO BOARD, AND THEN WARP TO SAFETY. - YOU HEARD HIM! - WHOA! WHAT? HEY! WHAT'S GOING ON? - Woman on PA: EVASIVE ACTION IMMINENT. ALL PERSONNEL, PREPARE FOR G-FORCE ENCUMBRANCE. EVASIVE ACTION IMMINENT. - MASSIVE COLLISION EVENT IN FIVE SECONDS. FOUR, THREE, TWO... - HANG ON. - ( all screaming ) - OPEN UP THE HANGAR DOOR. - KODAI'S IN. - WARP! - HER HEART'S NOT BEATING. - WHERE'S THE DOCTOR? - SET HER DOWN! - SHE'LL BE HERE ANY SECOND! - WHAT DO WE DO? - YUKI! YUKI! - I'LL DEFIBRILLATE HER. JUST BUY ME SOME TIME. - YUKI, OPEN YOUR EYES. SON OF A... - ( gasping ) ( coughing ) - SHE'S AWAKE. - SICK BAY. - ROGER. - ON THE DOUBLE. - UP ON THREE. ONE, TWO, THREE! - LET'S GO. RIGHT. - GOOD JOB. - YOU GAMBLED WITH THE LIVES OF EVERY PERSON ABOARD THE YAMATO, FOR ONE PILOT. - I HAD NO OTHER CHOICE, SIR. TO ME, LEAVING PEOPLE BEHIND TO DIE IS COWARDICE. - THROW THE GUNNER INTO THE BRIG. - I'M TRYING TO SURRENDER IT. - COME ON. - KODAI. NEVER MET A BRIG HE DIDN'T LIKE. ( laughs ) - CHIEF TOKUGAWA. - GLAD AS HELL TO SEE YOU. SURPRISED IT TOOK YOU THIS LONG TO PISS HIM OFF. ( laughs ) LOSING YOUR TOUCH? - TRY TO DO THE RIGHT THING, AND A BUNCH OF JARHEADS MARCH YOU DOWN INTO A CELL. - HMM. TWO OF A KIND. - HUH? - TELL YOU THE TRUTH, YOU REMIND ME A LOT OF HIM. YOUR OLDER BROTHER, WHEN HE WAS ABOUT YOUR AGE. - HOW AM I LIKE HIM? - FULL OF PISS AND VINEGAR, BUT COOL IN A FIGHT. BETTER WATCH IT. IF YOU'RE NOT CAREFUL, THEY'RE GONNA MAKE A SHIP'S CAPTAIN OUT OF YOU. - ( sighs ) I'M NOT TRYING TO ACT LIKE ANYBODY ELSE. I'M JUST TRYING TO FOLLOW MY CONSCIENCE, AND OKITA'S HAVING NONE OF IT. - ( chuckles ) THAT OLD HARD-ASS, HUH? THERE WAS A TIME WHEN EVEN OKITA ACTED A LOT LIKE YOU. IF WE LIVE LONG ENOUGH, FOR YOU TO GET OLD, WE'LL SEE WHO YOU BECOME. - OH, LOOK WHO IT IS. - WELCOME TO THE BRIG. - DOCTOR. HOW IS SHE? - THANKS TO YOU, YUKI'S OKAY. - GLAD TO HEAR IT. - HEY, WANT SOME? - YES, HE DOES. - YOU SHOULD BE GRATEFUL TO THE CAPTAIN. HE TOOK A BIG CHANCE WAITING LIKE HE DID. ANOTHER SECOND OR TWO, AND NONE OF US WOULD BE SITTING HERE RIGHT NOW. - I DIDN'T KNOW THAT. - Sado: LOOK, KODAI. IN THAT BATTLE OFF OF MARS, YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY GUY WITH A LOVED ONE WHO DIDN'T MAKE IT HOME. - WHO ARE WE TALKING ABOUT? - WELL, YOU KNOW, WE ALSO LOST THE FUYUZUKI THAT DAY. THE NAVIGATOR ON THAT SHIP, WAS CAPTAIN OKITA'S SON, REST HIS SOUL. - THIS IS CAPTAIN OKITA. WE'RE ABOUT TO LEAVE OUR SOLAR SYSTEM BEHIND. DUTY COMPELS US INTO A REALM UPON WHICH NO HUMAN BEING HAS EVER LAID EYES. VERY SOON, EARTH WILL BE TOO FAR FOR US TO CONTACT. THIS IS WHY TODAY ALL HANDS WILL HAVE ACCESS TO THE COMMUNICATIONS MODULE. THIS COULD BE YOUR FINAL MESSAGE TO YOUR LOVED ONES ON EARTH. I HOPE THAT YOU WILL TELL THEM EVERYTHING THAT IS IN YOUR HEART. - ( all murmuring ) - SO, I'M LIKE CAPTAIN OKITA? WHAT A BUNCH OF BULL. - Aihara: EACH OF YOU WILL HAVE ONE MINUTE. AT THE END OF 60 SECONDS, THE CONNECTION WILL AUTOMATICALLY BE CUT. THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU WANT TO SAY SO YOU CAN MAKE THE MOST OF YOUR TIME. - ( sniffling ) - Automated voice: WELCOME, CREWMAN. ENTER ID NUMBER. - WHAT AM I GONNA SAY? - HEY, LOOK WHO IT IS. - JIRO, IT'S DADDY. I'M DOING FINE. - AND, SON, BE CAREFUL NOT TO CATCH COLD. - CHILL OUT, MOM. I'LL BE OKAY. I'M TOO STUPID TO CATCH COLD, YOU KNOW? - WHEN YOU'RE SLEEPING, WRAP A TOWEL AROUND YOUR STOMACH, OR YOU'LL GET THE RUNS JUST LIKE ALWAYS. - I'LL BE HOME AGAIN REAL SOON, OKAY? AND WHEN I COME BACK, EARTH'LL BE PRETTIER THAN YOU'VE EVER SEEN. CROSS MY HEART. - JIRO, I... - Automated voice: YOUR TIME HAS EXPIRED. - DON'T FORGET YOUR GOOD-LUCK CHARM WHEN YOU'RE ON DUTY, OKAY? IT'S ALWAYS HELPED YOU COME HOME SAFE AND SOUND. - YEAH. ALL THE TIME. - AND TRY TO REMEMBER TO... - Automated voice: YOUR TIME HAS EXPIRED. - DAMN IT, MOM, YOU WORRY TOO MUCH. - 287, 288, 289, 290, 291, 292... - WHAT DO YOU WANT? - MOST PEOPLE DON'T DO SIT-UPS WHILE THEY'RE IN THE BRIG. - AND? - FINISH UP. IT'S YOUR TURN TO TALK TO EARTH. - FOR REAL? - INPUT YOUR ID NUMBER WHEN IT GIVES YOU THE PROMPT. - YOU ONLY GET A MINUTE. - WHICH ONE? - IT'S THERE ON YOUR DOG-TAGS. - PUNCH IT IN? - THAT YOU DO. - WAIT UP, KODAI. GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN. - HEY, DON'T YOU... - DON'T BLOW A FUSE, ANDO. - SO, YOU TRANSFERRED HERE? - YEAH. ASSIGNED TO THE THIRD BRIDGE, SIR. - GOOD JOB. - WELL, CATCH YOU LATER. HEYA, GUYS. THANKS FOR WAITING. THAT WAS THE SUSUMU KODAI I TOLD YOU ABOUT. - DUDE, CHILL. - YOU CAN WAIT RIGHT HERE. - OKAY. ( sighs ) UP AND ABOUT. THAT'S GOOD. - ARE YOU WAITING FOR ME TO SAY THANK YOU? - HUH? - LOOK, I DIDN'T ASK FOR YOU TO SAVE ME OUT THERE, OKAY? YOU PUT THE WHOLE SHIP IN DANGER. - HOW ABOUT YOU BUST MY BALLS A LITTLE LESS. JUST, LIKE, TEN PERCENT. YOU DO SORT OF OWE ME. WHAT'S THAT THERE? GOTCHA. OLDEST TRICK IN THE BOOK. - Automated voice: WELCOME, CREWMAN. ENTER ID NUMBER. - BACK IN THE SADDLE, HUH? ARE YOU OKAY? - YEAH. GLAD TO BE BREATHING. - YOU SEEN KODAI YET? - I SAW HIM OVER AT THE MESSAGE ROOM. GETTING HIS MINUTE WITH HIS FAMILY, I ASSUME. - HIS FAMILY? ARE YOU SURE? - HUH? - WELL, YOU WERE ON THE TEAM, RIGHT? - UH-HUH. - ALTHOUGH HE QUIT PRETTY SOON AFTER I WAS ASSIGNED TO THE TEAM. I WAS REASSIGNED RIGHT AFTER THAT, SO I NEVER REALLY CAUGHT THE VIBE. - OH. - HONESTLY, I ONLY ENLISTED BECAUSE KODAI'S HEROICS HAD SUCH AN EFFECT ON ME, AND THEN HE WAS DONE. IT'S TOUGH WHEN YOUR HEROES ARE PEOPLE. KODAI DOESN'T NEED TO KNOW ALL OF THAT. - HE HAD A GOOD REASON FOR QUITTING. - YEAH? - A MINUTE TO TALK TO MY FAMILY? - Shima: WHEN THE GAMILAS FIRST STARTED BOMBARDING US, WE USED TO GO UP AND RUN INTERCEPT MISSIONS ON THE BOMBS. IT'S TOUGH TO BELIEVE NOW, BUT THEY USED TO BE ALMOST FRAGILE. WE BLEW UP A FEW, KNOCKED SOME OFF-TARGET. - ( laughs ) YOU MAKE IT SOUND LIKE NO BIG DEAL. QUIT BEING MODEST. - KODAI WAS OUR ROCK STAR. I WAS LIKE THE BACKUP SINGER. WELL, ONE AFTERNOON, THIS BOMB COMES HURLING IN, AND WE MANAGE TO KNOCK IT AWAY. WE SAVED THE EARTH ONCE AGAIN! ONLY THIS TIME, OUR ACTIONS CAME WITH LETHAL CONSEQUENCES. - ( sighs ) I GUESS YOU'RE ALL THE FAMILY I'VE GOT. HOW YOU BEEN, ANALYZER? - MR. KODAI, PLEASE DON'T CRY ONTO ME. SALT WATER WILL CORRODE MY CIRCUITRY. - WHAT MAKES YOU THINK I'M GONNA CRY? - THE GAMILAS BOMB WE DIVERTED HEADED STRAIGHT FOR SPACE STATION NUMBER TWO. - THAT WAS HIM? - HIS PARENTS WERE ABOARD, AND SO WAS MY PREGNANT WIFE. SHE SURVIVED IT, BUT THEY WEREN'T SO LUCKY. THEY MANAGED TO SAVE THE BABY, TOO, BUT JIRO'S NEVER BEEN ABLE TO TALK. AFTER THAT, HE JUST COULDN'T BEAR TO FLY. - Automated voice: YOUR TIME HAS EXPIRED. - Narrator: HAVING SAID THEIR GOODBYES, THE CREW OF THE SPACE BATTLESHIP YAMATO HEADS FOR THE LARGE MAGELLANIC CLOUD, AND THE PLANET ISKANDAR, TO OBTAIN THE ANTI-RADIATION DEVICE SAID TO EXIST THERE. - Aihara: ALL CLEAR, CAPTAIN. NO GRAVITY FIELD DETECTED. WARP SUCCESSFUL. PICKING UP ANOTHER CRAFT. - IT'S A GAMILAS FIGHTER! - IS IT ALONE? - AFFIRMATIVE! - NANBU! - ON IT! - THIS IS STRANGE. - WHY ISN'T IT ATTACKING US? - Susumu: WHAT? - PUTTING IT ON DISPLAY. - DID IT WARP WITH THE YAMATO? - KODAI. - SIR? - I WANT YOU TO BRING THAT ENEMY FIGHTER ABOARD. LET'S SEE WHAT WE CAN LEARN FROM IT. - ROGER. - ( groans in pain ) - CAPTAIN. - CALL SICK BAY. - CAPTAIN. - NANBU, YOU'RE IN CHARGE. - ROGER. - KEEP TO YOUR POST, ENSIGN. - YES SIR. - CAPTAIN. - SO, WHAT'S THE VERDICT? - SADLY, IT IS PROGRESSING. - THOUGHT SO. WELL, THEN, HOW LONG DO I HAVE LEFT? - LISTEN TO ME. SOON ENOUGH, THOSE PILLS AREN'T GOING TO HELP. - WILL I LIVE TO SEE IT? - NO SIGN OF A COCKPIT. MAYBE IT FLIES ITSELF. - I'VE NEVER REALLY SEEN ONE, YOU KNOW? - YOU'VE SEEN A LOT. ( scoffs ) DON'T EVEN. - HOW CLOSE CAN I LOOK IN A DOGFIGHT? - I DON'T SEE ANY SIGNS OF LIFE. - THINK MAYBE IT'S A DRONE? - SAITO. - YEAH? - TAKE A PIECE OF THE FUSELAGE, BUT BE CAREFUL NOT TO DAMAGE ANYTHING. - ( laughs ) YEAH, YEAH. ONCE I'VE WORKED MY MAGIC, YOUR LITTLE SAMPLE MIGHT BE ALL THAT'S LEFT OF THIS THING. - LIGHT IT UP! - ( guns firing ) - ( shrieking ) - SANADA, WAIT. - ( screams ) - SAITO. MY GOD. SAITO. - FIGHT IT! - ( yells in pain ) - GET THE DOCTOR DOWN HERE! - RIGHT! - HEY! - ( grunting ) - CREW OF THE YAMATO, THE PLANET EARTH IS RIPE FOR CONQUERING. - WHO AM I TALKING TO? - DESLA. - DESLA? - YOU REFER TO US AS GAMILAS, YES? - WAS THAT CRYSTALLINE STRUCTURE YOUR CONSCIOUSNESS? - YOU ARE CORRECT. AND NOT. WE ARE COMPRISED OF INDIVIDUALS, YET WE ARE ONE BEING. WE ARE THE BEGINNING, AND THE END. THE ALPHA AND THE OMEGA. - AND WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT? - WHY ARE YOU ATTACKING OUR PLANET? - ATTACKING IT? ( laughs ) WE'RE TERRAFORMING IT, HUMAN. - SAITO? - YOU'RE GOING DOWN! - DON'T SHOOT IT! - ( all laughing ) - YEAH, IT'S A RIOT. - SORRY, I BLASTED YOU, MAN. YOU KNOW WHAT, THOUGH, THAT'S HOW MUCH KICK I HAD TO GIVE IT TO CONVINCE THAT THING YOU WERE DOWN FOR THE COUNT. - OH, YOU'RE SUCH A GIVER. A PULSE GUN ON LEVEL TWO? YOU COULD KNOCK OUT A BEAR WITH THAT CRAP. - TOO LATE! - YEAH? - WATCH YOUR ASS. NEXT TIME, I'LL SET THIS BAD-BOY TO THREE. - HE GOT YOU, MAN. GET OUT. - THAT CRAP HURTS. - IF ANYONE ELSE TOOK A HIT LIKE THAT, THEY'D STILL BE UP IN SICK BAY. - SUCK IT UP, YA BIG SOFTY. - FOR KNOCKING ME OUT, YOU HAVE MY THANKS. - YOU OWE ME ONE, SOLDIER. - I GOT YOU. - WHAT ARE YOU DOING? - I AM GONNA BUY YOU A BEER, KODAI. - NOW WE'RE EVEN. - CHEAPSKATE! - ( rumbling ) - CAPTAIN, IT'S KODAI. - COME IN. - ( machine beeping ) - COMING IN. - YOU WANTED ME? - HMM. - KODAI. - SIR? - HOW DO YOU LIKE THE SHIP? - I'VE NEVER SERVED ON A BATTLESHIP BEFORE, SO I CAN'T REALLY COMPARE. BUT I KNOW SHE'S QUALITY. YOU WANTED TO DISCUSS SOMETHING? - KODAI. - SIR? - WOULD YOU ASSUME THE ROLE OF ACTING CAPTAIN? - WHAT? - I HAD ALWAYS HOPED YOUR BROTHER MAMORU WOULD SUCCEED ME. - I'M NOT HIM. - YOU HAVE LEADERSHIP IN YOUR BONES, THE SAME WAY HE DID. YOU BELONG AT THE HELM, KODAI. - WILL YOU? - SORRY, BUT NO. I CAN'T DO IT. I COULDN'T... COULDN'T LIVE WITH THE DECISIONS THAT YOU'VE MADE. - WELL, THEN. IF YOUR MIND IS MADE UP. - EXCUSE ME. - KODAI, I'M NOT ASKING YOU TO BE THE CAPTAIN I HAVE BEEN. DO IT YOUR OWN WAY. STILL A NO? ALL RIGHT. I WON'T BURDEN YOU WITH THE ILLUSION OF CHOICE. LISTEN UP, AS OF RIGHT NOW, MR. KODAI IS SERVING IN THE ROLE OF ACTING CAPTAIN. THAT'S ALL. GOOD LUCK. - SCRAMBLE THE FIGHTERS! WE NEED TO GET OUT THERE ASAP. - Woman on PA: GAMILAS ATTACK IN PROGRESS. - I REPEAT, GAMILAS ATTACK IN PROGRESS. - YOU'RE THE CAPTAIN NOW. - WHERE ARE YOU GOING? - THE HANGAR! WHEN DID IT START? - WE'RE NOT EXACTLY SURE, SIR. WE ONLY JUST NOTICED IT. - AS FAR AS I CAN TELL, IT'S SENDING SOME SORT OF TRANSMISSION. - AN SOS? - WORSE. - IT'S OUR LOCATION. THEY PAINTED A BULLSEYE ON US. - MR. SANADA, YOU HAVE THE HELM. - I HOPE YOU'RE READY FOR ACTION, BLACK TIGERS! - All: YES SIR! - WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? DESTROY IT. - All: ROGER. - THE GAMILAS WOULDN'T SEND JUST ONE. HOW MANY MORE OUT THERE? - THIRD WAVE APPROACHING. THEY'VE OPENED FIRE. - HELL. SHIMA, EVADE! - I'LL TRY. - ( screaming ) - DAMN IT. DAMAGE REPORT. - BRIDGE NUMBER THREE HAS TAKEN MASSIVE DAMAGE. THE CREW IS TRAPPED INSIDE. - HOW MUCH AIR? - ENOUGH FOR NOW BUT THEY DON'T HAVE TOO LONG. - SEND A RESCUE SQUAD ON THE DOUBLE. PATCH ME IN TO BRIDGE NUMBER THREE. - GO AHEAD! - ( static ) - THIS IS ANDO. CAN ANYBODY HEAR ME? THE ELEVATOR SHAFT'S BEEN HIT. WE'RE TRAPPED DOWN HERE, AND WE'VE GOT WOUNDED. IF WE DON'T GET A MEDIC SOON, THEY'RE NOT GONNA MAKE IT. - ACTING CAPTAIN KODAI HERE. A RESCUE SQUAD IS ON THE WAY. JUST TRY TO STAY CALM AND STABILIZE YOUR WOUNDED. ANDO, YOU'RE DOING FINE DOWN THERE. WE'LL SEE YOU SOON. - THANK YOU, SIR. - WHERE'RE THEY NOW? - GAMILAS BOGEYS, THREE O' CLOCK. - SHIMA. TURN HARD TO STARBOARD. - ROGER THAT. - CHIEF TOKUGAWA. START CHARGING THE GUN. - WITH PLEASURE. CHARGING. - TARGETING SCOPE, OPEN. OUR PREY IS THE ENEMY GUNSHIP. TRAJECTORIES ARE IN SYNC. GOT THEM IN MY CROSS HAIRS. - SIXTY KILOMETERS OUT. - ENERGY BUILD-UP AT ONE HUNDRED TWENTY PERCENT. - TEN SECONDS TO WAVE-MOTION GUN. BRIDGE CREW, BRACE FOR THE FLASH AND RECOIL. FIVE, FOUR, THREE, TWO, ONE, ZERO. FIRE! - GAMILAS GUNBOAT HAS BEEN DESTROYED. THE ENEMY FLEET IS GONE. - ALL RIGHT! - YES! ALL RIGHT. THAT'S HOW YOU DO IT. - I'M GETTING A SIGNAL FROM UNDER US. - UNDER US? - ( crashing ) - ENERGY OUTPUT RISING. IT'S GOING TO EXPLODE. - EVACUATE BRIDGE NUMBER THREE. - THERE'S NO TIME. - THE BLAST'LL KILL US ALL. - EXPLOSION IMMINENT. - KODAI! - YUKI, THIS IS KODAI. FIRE ON BRIDGE NUMBER THREE. TAKE IT OUT. DO IT! - YES, SIR. - IT WAS A STEALTH CRAFT. THE RADAR DIDN'T PICK IT UP. I SHOULD HAVE SEEN IT COMING. SIX OF OUR CREW WERE SERVING ON THAT BRIDGE. THEIR DEATHS ARE ON ME. I AM NOT FIT TO SERVE AS YOUR ACTING CAPTAIN. - WHY DID YOU RE-ENLIST? YOU WERE FREE OF THIS LIFE. WHY DID YOU COME BACK? - I HAD TO FIND OUT WHAT KIND OF A MAN YOU ARE. TO KNOW, WHAT KIND OF A CAPTAIN MY BROTHER MAMORU LAID DOWN HIS LIFE TO PROTECT. - I SEE. - BUT ALSO, TO SEE THE EARTH MADE BEAUTIFUL AGAIN. TO HAVE IT BACK LIKE IT WAS WHEN I WAS A KID. I WANTED TO SEE IT LIVE AGAIN. WHAT SHOULD I HAVE DONE? WHEN THERE IS NO GOOD CHOICE, HOW DO YOU MAKE THAT DECISION? - KODAI. THE PAST IS NO PLACE FOR A MAN TO LIVE, ESPECIALLY NOT A LEADER. YOU'LL FIND NO COMFORT THERE. YOU PLAY WITH THE CARDS YOU'RE HANDED. YOU DO YOUR BEST FOR AS MANY AS YOU CAN. - YOU SAY THAT, BUT IT DOESN'T MAKE IT ANY EASIER TO STOMACH. MAYBE YOU CAN JUST WRITE THEM OFF, BUT I'M NOT LIKE YOU, CAPTAIN OKITA. - I FEEL THEIR DEATHS, KODAI. THERE WAS A TIME WHEN I FELT THEM JUST AS KEENLY AS YOU. LEADING A CREW MEANS SHOULDERING A BURDEN NO ONE ELSE CAN CARRY BUT YOU. I BELIEVE YOU'RE DOING A FINE JOB AS ACTING CAPTAIN. KODAI, THERE IS... THERE IS SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT YOU NEED TO KNOW. - ( knocking on door ) - WHO IS IT? - IT'S KODAI. - WHY ARE YOU HERE? - TO APOLOGIZE. - I DON'T FOLLOW. - FOR GIVING THAT ORDER. I'M SORRY. - YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY SORRY. IF YOU THOUGHT THAT YOU DID, YOU'RE WRONG. WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT, YOU'RE THE CAPTAIN OF THIS SHIP RIGHT NOW. YOU DID WHAT YOU HAD TO DO, AND SO DID I. EVEN THOUGH IT MEANT... ( crying ) IT MEANT THAT I HAD TO... ...SHOOT PEOPLE I KNOW. ( sobbing ) - IT'S OKAY. - THIS WASN'T VERY PROFESSIONAL OF ME. SORRY ABOUT THAT. - DON'T BE. DON'T EVER BE SORRY. - Woman on PA: ALL HANDS, STAND BY FOR WARP. ALL HANDS, STAND BY FOR WARP. - ( all exclaiming ) - SORRY ABOUT THAT. EVERY TIME WE WARP... - I SEE ISKANDAR. - ISKANDAR? - ISKANDAR? - COME ON, YOU GUYS, WE'RE THERE. - HUH? WHOA! - WE'RE THERE. ISKANDAR. - ( beeping ) - Aihara: MISSILES AT TWELVE O'CLOCK. ABOUT SIXTY OF THEM. THEY'RE CLOSING IN FAST. - THEY INVITED US HERE. WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON? - THE WAVE-MOTION GUN IS OFFLINE. - I KNOW. BATTLE STATIONS. - ( alarm sounding ) - THE MISSILES, SIR, THEY'RE BREAKING INTO GROUPS. THEY'RE HEADED ABOVE AND BELOW US, PORT AND STARBOARD! - ALL GUNS, LOCK ONTO ENEMY TARGETS. - TEN SECONDS! - WEAPONS HOT. FIRE! - ( siren sounding ) - LARGE MISSILE, INCOMING. TEN SECONDS TO IMPACT. - ONE AND TWO, YOU HIT THAT MISSILE WITH EVERYTHING YOU'VE GOT. - ( grunting ) - IT DIDN'T EXPLODE. - WHAT THE... - SIT-REP, GIVE ME A DAMAGE REPORT. - Nanbu: CAPTAIN, THE WAVE-MOTION GUN... - I KNOW, IT'S NOT READY. - IT'S THE MUZZLE. THEY JAMMED IT. - THEY WHAT? - ENEMY FLEET DEAD AHEAD. - FIRE ON THEM WITH EVERY CANNON AND GET THAT WAVE-MOTION GUN OPERATIONAL! - THEY'LL GRIND US INTO DUST. - MORE MISSILES INCOMING. IMPACT IN THIRTY SECONDS, SIR. - Nanbu: WE CAN'T TARGET THEM ALL. THERE ARE JUST TOO MANY. - THEN WE RUN. WARP US OUT OF HERE. - Aihara: BUT I DON'T HAVE ANY COORDINATES SET. - IF WE DON'T, THEN WE'LL DIE! - KODAI, WE CAN'T! - INCOMING! - SHIMA! - ( groaning ) - Sanada: KODAI! HAVE YOU LOST YOUR MIND? IF THERE'D BEEN ANYTHING AT THESE COORDINATES WE'D BE OBLITERATED! - WE'D BE JUST AS DEAD IF THOSE MISSILES HIT US! LOCATION? - I THINK WE'RE STILL NEAR ISKANDAR. - ARE WE? - IS THAT THE SAME PLANET WE WERE APPROACHING BEFORE? - Aihara: YES, SIR. THAT'S THE SAME ONE. WE ONLY WARPED TO THE OTHER SIDE OF IT. - IT LOOKS LIKE EARTH. GAMILAS WEAPONRY. - ARE YOU SURE? - THIS WAS A GAMILAS MISSILE. - HAS THERE BEEN A MISTAKE? DID WE COME TO THE WRONG PLANET? - ( sighs ) - SEE, NOW. WE KNOW THEY PLAYED US. - PLAYED US? - YEAH, AND WE FELL FOR IT. ISKANDAR. THE MAGICAL RADIATION DEVICE JUST IN TIME. ( scoffs ) IT WAS A GAMILAS TRAP! - BUT WHY? WHY WOULD THEY GO TO THE TROUBLE? - TO LURE THE YAMATO AWAY. - IF IT SOUNDS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE, THEN IT PROBABLY IS. I ANALYZED THAT COMMUNICATIONS CAPSULE, AND IT WASN'T MENTIONED, NOT ONCE. JUST SCHEMATICS FOR THE GUN AND ENGINE, AND COORDINATES HERE. - WHAT'RE YOU TELLING US? - THE RADIATION DEVICE THAT LURED US OUT HERE MIGHT BE NOTHING MORE THAN A BAD FAIRY TALE. - THAT'S CRAZY. WHY WOULD ANYONE DO SUCH A THING? - WE LEFT EARTH UNGUARDED AND WE WEREN'T EVEN SURE? GUESS THAT MEANS THE CAPTAIN WAS LYING TO US. - BITE YOUR TONGUE. HE'S A GOOD MAN. HOW COULD YOU THINK THAT? - I'LL GO ASK HIM. - YOU CAN'T. HE'S BARELY HANGING ON. - YOU MEAN? - HELL, I'M GAME. - SAITO! - HE'S THE ONLY ONE WHO KNOWS THE TRUTH, ISN'T HE? WE NEED TO ASK HIM WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON. WHAT'RE WE ALL RISKING OUR ASSES FOR? ANYTHING? TELL ME, KODAI! - WE'RE GOING DOWN THERE. THE MESSAGE INCLUDED COORDINATES ON THE PLANET ITSELF. WE'LL GET THE ANSWERS WE NEED ON ISKANDAR. - KODAI, ARE YOU INSANE? - YOU'RE GONNA BE MARCHING US RIGHT INTO THE LION'S DEN, YOU KNOW THAT? - WHY WOULD THEY ATTACK US IN SPACE IF THE REAL TRAP IS ON THE PLANET? THERE'S A REASON THEY DON'T WANT US GOING TO THOSE COORDINATES ON THE SURFACE, AND I'M GOING TO FIND OUT WHAT IT IS. SOMEONE SENT THOSE ENGINE PLANS. AND THAT ENGINE'S BETTER TECHNOLOGY THAN WE'VE EVER SEEN. LOOK, IF WE DON'T SEND A TEAM DOWN THERE TO INVESTIGATE, NONE OF US WILL EVER KNOW THE TRUTH. OKITA FOLLOWED THAT MESSAGE THROUGH THE STARS. HE BELIEVED IT, AND I BELIEVE IN HIM. CAPTAIN OKITA LOVES THE EARTH AS MUCH AS ANYBODY ON THIS SHIP. SANADA. YUKI. SAITO. SHIMA. IF WE CAN PULL THIS OFF, THE EARTH LIVES. OUR BENEFACTORS SENT US SPECIFIC COORDINATES. THEY WILL LEAD US TO A POINT BENEATH THE SURFACE OF THE PLANET RIGHT HERE. OUR MISSION IS SIMPLE, WE GO THERE. THE STRIKE TEAM WILL BE THE BLACK TIGERS, THE MARINES, TECH OFFICER SANADA, AND ME. - YOU'RE GOING DOWN? HOW COME? - THE GAMILAS HAVE AN AERIAL DEFENSE SYSTEM. KODAI'S GOING TO KNOCK IT OUT FOR US. ONSCREEN. THIS IS THE AIR-SPACE RIGHT ABOVE THE TEAM'S LZ. THE SKY IS TEEMING WITH THESE DEFENSE SENTRIES, BUT, SLIPPING THROUGH THEM IS OUR ONLY OPTION. - IT'S IMPOSSIBLE. - MY COSMO ZERO CAN DO IT. ITS ONBOARD TECH PREDATES THE GAMILAS ATTACK, AND IT CAN CLOAK. - STEALTH CAPABILITY'S NOT GOING TO HELP YOU. SOON AS YOU FIRE YOUR ENGINE, THEY'LL KNOW EXACTLY WHERE YOU ARE. - THEN I GUESS I'LL JUST HAVE TO DO IT IN FREE-FALL. - ( all murmuring ) - IS HE SERIOUS? - BLACK TIGERS, YOU'LL ATTACK ON MY COMMAND. MAKE SURE THAT OUR MARINES GET THEIR BOOTS ON THE GROUND. PROCEED WITH CAUTION. WE'VE LOST ENOUGH LIVES IN THIS WAR. - THEY'LL BE DOZENS OF THEM. DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE THAT YOU CAN TAKE THEM ALL? - ( all chattering ) - ATTENTION ALL PERSONNEL. THIS IS ACTING CAPTAIN KODAI. AS YOU ALL KNOW, OUR LANDING ON GAMILAS IS ABOUT TO TAKE PLACE. THIS BATTLE WILL PROBABLY BE THE LAST ONE OF A JOURNEY THAT SPANNED SO MANY LIGHT-YEARS. IN APRIL OF 1945, BATTLESHIP YAMATO SET SAIL TO BE A RAY OF HOPE WHEN OUR PEOPLE WERE IN THEIR DARKEST HOUR. WE'RE DOING THE SAME. THE COORDINATES WE WERE GIVEN MAY BE A GAMILAS TRAP. MAYBE THIS IS WHAT THEY WANT. MAYBE WE'RE PLAYING RIGHT INTO THEIR HANDS. BUT AS LONG AS HOPE STILL FLICKERS IN THE LONG NIGHT, AS LONG AS THERE'S A GHOST OF A CHANCE, WE WILL CHAMPION OUR CAUSE. AND IF THE STRUGGLE CLAIMS OUR LIVES, SO BE IT. WE ARE THE KEEPERS OF A PROUD TRADITION. THE HONOR OF A SHIP WORTHY OF THE NAME YAMATO. IT'S A PRIVILEGE TO SHARE THIS MOMENT WITH ALL OF YOU. WE ARE HERE AS AGENTS OF HOPE. AND NOW, AS THE EARTH IS IN ITS DARKEST HOUR, WE'RE GOING TO FIGHT TO SAVE OUR PLANET. NO, WE'RE DOING THIS TO SAVE THE PEOPLE WE LOVE. WE'LL MAKE THE EARTH AS GREEN AS IT WAS BEFORE. IN THE NAME OF THE YAMATO! AND FOR CAPTAIN OKITA. WE GO UNTO GLORY, OR TO DEATH! - Kato: WE'LL TAKE THE LEFT SIDE OF THE FORMATION. - OKAY. - COPY THAT. - All: ROGER! - YOU SONS OF BITCHES READY TO KILL SOME GAMILAS? - All: Yeah! - I CAN'T HEAR YOU! - All: YEAH! - YOU DAMN WELL BETTER BE! - All: YEAH! - YOU GONNA BRING YOUR A-GAME? - All: YEAH! - ISKANDAR OR BUST! - THIS MISSION IS GONNA BE A ONE-WAY TRIP FOR A LOT OF 'EM. - AND THAT'S WHAT MAKES THE JOB SO FUN. - All: YEAH! - SEE YOU ON THE GROUND. - I HAVEN'T BEEN IN THE COSMO ZERO FOR A WHILE. - WELL, YOU'RE WELCOME. YOU READY TO MAKE UP FOR LOST TIME? - ROGER. - Woman on PA: ATTENTION ALL PILOTS. PLEASE REPORT TO YOUR FIGHTERS IMMEDIATELY. REPEAT, ALL PILOTS PLEASE REPORT TO YOUR FIGHTERS IMMEDIATELY. - PRE-BATTLE DIAGNOSTICS ARE MANDATORY. - OKAY. - RIGHT WING, CHECK. LEFT WING, CHECK. OKAY. WANNA COME WITH? - YOU'RE GONNA SHOW OFF OUT THERE, AREN'T YOU? - OH, SURE. LIKE YOU'RE ONE TO TALK. BE SAFE OUT THERE, YEAH? - Woman on PA: COSMO ZERO ONE. YOU ARE READY FOR LAUNCH. - THIS IS KODAI. LET'S DO IT. - ( engine starting ) - Analyzer: MR. KODAI, THAT EXCHANGE WITH YUKI MORI JUST NOW, WHAT PURPOSE DID IT SERVE? - JUST GIVING MYSELF MORE INCENTIVE TO MAKE IT BACK IN ONE PIECE. - EIGHT THOUSAND METERS TO THE SURFACE OF THE PLANET. SEVEN THOUSAND, SIX THOUSAND. FIVE THOUSAND, FOUR THOUSAND. - WAIT FOR IT, KODAI. WAIT FOR IT. TAKE OUT THE GUNS. ( grunting ) COME ON, SHIMA. - MAKE ME PROUD, KODAI. - ALL RIGHT. WARPING NOW. - YOU OKAY? - WE'RE HANGING IN. - HEY, KODAI, I THINK I'M GONNA BREAK YOUR RECORD TODAY. - YOU SAY THAT EVERY TIME WE GO ON A MISSION. - YEAH, BUT THIS TIME, IT'S TRUE. - ( screaming ) - FURUYA! - HEADS UP. THE ENEMY'S ABOVE US. - Man: WE'RE IN A BAD WAY HERE. THEY'RE SWARMING THE CARRIER. - ROGER THAT. YAMAMOTO. YAMAMOTO! ( exclaims in frustration ) - Kato: ENEMY DESTROYED. ALL RIGHT. THERE ARE THREE OF US LEFT WITH THE TROOP CARRIER. - COPY THAT. - Yuki Mori: STAY ALERT. OUR LANDING ZONE IS DEAD AHEAD. OH, WOW. - Sanada: KODAI, WE'RE COMING UP ON THE COORDINATES. - ALL RIGHT. TIME TO LAND. - ( all yelling ) - Saito: LIGHT 'EM UP! - Susumu: YUKI, QUICK. - RIGHT. - ( guns firing ) - Susumu: SAITO! - Saito: I GOTCHA! - Susumu: HEADS UP. THEY'RE ON OUR SIX. - YOU HEARD THE MAN. - ( all screaming ) - Saito: NOT TODAY, YOU BASTARD. DAMN IT, THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF 'EM. - ANALYZER, GO INTO STAND-ALONE MODE. WE'RE PINNED DOWN. - WITH PLEASURE, MR. KODAI. HURRY UP. - I'M GOING OUT THERE. COVER ME. THEY'RE DEAD. SON OF A... SCREW IT. - Analyzer: MR. KODAI, MAKE IT BACK TO EARTH FOR ME. - ANALYZER! DAMN IT. - ( guns firing ) - ( all groaning ) - COME ON! - BASTARDS! - GO ON, WE'LL KEEP 'EM BUSY. ( groaning ) - KATO! - WE AREN'T GONNA HOLD 'EM TOO LONG. YOU SHOULD GET GOING. ( grunting ) - Saito: WE HAVE TO GO. - DO IT. FOLLOW ME! - ( beeping ) - THE COORDINATES LEAD US TO RIGHT HERE. - THIS IS ISKANDAR. - YUKI. DON'T! ( gasps ) YUKI! - WE HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU, EARTHLINGS. - WHERE IS YUKI? - IT'S LIKE WHAT THEY DID TO SAITO. - SO THE STUFF ABOUT ISKANDAR WAS ALL TRUE. - THAT IS BUT A NAME ONE OF YOUR KIND APPLIED TO US. ONE WHO IS KNOWN AS OKITA. - WHAT IN THE HELL? - I KNEW IT. - Okita: KODAI, THERE IS... THERE IS SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT YOU NEED TO KNOW. THE MESSAGE ABOUT A RADIATION DEVICE ON ISKANDAR IS A LIE. ALL OF IT. - HOW COULD IT BE A LIE? - WE WERE SENT COORDINATES AND BLUEPRINTS. THAT WAS ALL. THERE IS NO DEVICE. - THEN WHY THE STORY? - IT'S BECAUSE OF YOU. - OF ME? - THE RADIATION YOU TOOK SHOULD'VE BURNED YOU DOWN TO YOUR BONES. BUT YOU RECOVERED FROM IT, AND THAT MADE ME THINK THAT MAYBE THE SENDER OF THE CAPSULE HAD A WAY TO DISPEL RADIATION. I BET IT ALL ON ONE HAND. - HOLD ON. WE'RE TRAVELING THOUSANDS OF LIGHT-YEARS TO GET A DEVICE THAT DOESN'T EVEN EXIST? - THAT'S RIGHT. ( coughing ) BUT... WE CARRY OUR HOPES WITH US. YOU CAME ABOARD THIS SHIP WITH HOPE HIDDEN IN YOUR SOUL. DIDN'T YOU? YOU AND I HAVE SURVIVED THIS LONG. WHO CAN TELL? MAYBE MY GAMBIT WILL PAY OFF. AS LONG AS YOU DRAW BREATH, YOU'RE ON THE WINNING SIDE. - OUR RACE HAS EVOLVED PAST EGO. WE REVEL IN THE GLORY OF A SINGLE MIND, SHARED AMONG MANY. THE GAMILAS ARE ONE ASPECT OF THIS SHARED MANIFESTATION. THE POLAR OPPOSITE OF THAT IS WHAT YOU CALL ISKANDAR. GAMILAS AND ISKANDAR WERE A SINGLE ESSENCE, IN BETTER TIMES. TWO SIDES OF THE SAME COIN. OUR PLANET'S FATED TO DIE, HAVING REACHED THE END OF ITS LIFE. ISKANDAR IS AT PEACE WITH THIS OUTCOME, AND WILL EMBRACE EXTINCTION. HOWEVER, GAMILAS WISH TO WIPE OUT YOUR RACE, AND TAKE YOUR PLANET AS A SURROGATE THAT BOTH ASPECTS MAY YET SURVIVE. ISKANDAR DOES NOT APPROVE OF THIS, SO GAMILAS BROKE AWAY, AND IMPRISONED US HERE. WE LOCATED A TINY FRAGMENT OF OURSELVES THAT REMAINED IN GAMILAS, AND SENT IT TO EARTH AS A TOKEN OF OUR GOODWILL. - THAT TOKEN WAS THE CAPSULE. - AND THE RADIATION DEVICE? PLEASE TELL ME YOU HAVE SOMETHING LIKE THAT. - IT DOES NOT EXIST. BUT WE WOULD COUNSEL YOU NOT TO DESPAIR AT THIS REVELATION. WE CAN REMOVE IT BETTER THAN ANY DEVICE. SOMETHING YOU KNOW TO BE TRUE. - ( gasps ) - GO ON. YOU'RE ASKING US TO TAKE A LOT ON FAITH HERE. WE NEED TO BE SURE YOU CAN DELIVER. - THE AIR IN THIS CAVERN IS NO LONGER RADIOACTIVE. GO AHEAD AND BREATHE IT WITHOUT YOUR HELMETS. - ( gasping ) - GO AHEAD. - MY ENERGY IS MORE THAN SUFFICIENT. WE WILL ACCOMPANY YOU TO EARTH, AND RENDER IT HEALTHY ANEW. - YUKI. - I'M OKAY. THEY ARE, TOO. - ( beeping ) - WAIT! - WHAT IS THAT? - IF THE GAMILAS HAVE A CENTRAL CORE, WE'RE LOOKING AT IT. BLOW THAT TO HELL, AND WE'LL BE DONE WITH THEM FOREVER. - SONS OF BITCHES. YEAH. YOU LIKE THAT? I LOVE THIS PART! ( grunting ) - KODAI. - YEAH? - WE'RE GONNA TAKE OUT THE CORE FOR YOU, SO GO ON. - YOU'RE NUTS. YOU'LL NEVER GET CLOSE ENOUGH. - ONCE THE TWO OF US CROSS THAT WALKWAY, GET THE YAMATO OUT OF HERE. - WHAT, AND JUST LEAVE YOU BEHIND? - SAITO! - ROGER THAT. - HOLD ON, DAMN IT. YOU KNOW WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN IF YOU STAY. - OH, GET OVER IT. DON'T WRITE US OFF JUST YET. ( grunting ) ( groans ) ( laughs ) YEAH, WHATEVER. LUCKY SHOT. - THE YAMATO IS WAITING FOR THE TWO OF YOU, SO GO. - I CAN'T JUST LEAVE... - DO IT. I NEVER HAD A BROTHER, BUT YOU WOULD HAVE MADE A GREAT ONE. - ( sniffling ) - YOU SHOULDN'T WASTE YOUR TEARS ON US. NOW BACK TO YOUR SHIP, CAPTAIN. READY TO GO? - GET IT GREEN AGAIN. I SHOULD'VE BOUGHT YOU ANOTHER ROUND. HERE GOES! ( yelling ) - THERE'S TOO MANY. - HURRY. WHILE YOU'VE STILL GOT A CHOICE. - YOU HEARD HIM. LET'S GO! - SWITCH. - ( grunting ) - ( gasps ) - AREN'T YOU A TECH GENIUS OR SOMETHING? SLAP IT ON AND LET HER RIP! - I NEED MORE TIME. GET OUT THERE AND HOLD THEM OFF. - ROGER THAT. ( yelling ) ( groans ) OH, SON OF A... GOD, THAT HURTS. ( grunting ) CAN YOU DO YOUR THING ONE LAST TIME? WE ARE GETTING OUR PLANET BACK! - DAMN IT. - IT'S ALL RIGHT. WE CAN GO IN MY COSMO TIGER. - IT'S SET TO BLOW. SAITO! SAITO! ( grunts ) - COME ON. - OUR MIRACLE. YOU FOUND IT? - YES. - WHAT ARE THE ODDS? - YEAH. - WE BOUGHT THE EARTH A FIGHTING CHANCE AT SURVIVAL AT THE COST OF MANY LIVES. IF YOU THINK WE'RE IN THE CLEAR, WE'RE NOT. - ROGER. - Shima: WE'RE ABOUT TO ENTER OUR FINAL WARP. EARTH WILL BE IN VISUAL RANGE UPON ARRIVAL. - GO. YOU'RE NEEDED. - GET SOME REST. - NOW, THEN. TIME TO FACE THE FOE WHO DEFEATS US ALL. DOCTOR, I WOULD LIKE TO BE ALONE FOR A WHILE. DR. SADO, THANK YOU. - WHERE IS EARTH? - I SEE IT. - SHOW US. - IT'S THE LITTLE RED ONE. - Susumu: YOU'RE RIGHT. EARTH IS RIGHT THERE. - ( all exclaiming excitedly ) - WE'RE BACK! - Todo: YAMATO? - DAMN IT, YAMATO. - WE'RE HOME, YOU GUYS. - Todo: DO YOU READ? - YES, SIR, THIS IS YAMATO. ACTING CAPTAIN KODAI AND 36 CREW REPORTING. CURRENTLY FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND KILOMETERS FROM EARTH. - TELL ME, DID YOU LOCATE THE DEVICE? - WE HAVE FULFILLED OUR MISSION. AND ON THIS SHIP IS EVERYTHING WE'LL NEED TO HEAL THE EARTH. - YOU MEAN THAT THERE REALLY WAS SUCH A THING? THE EARTH'S SURFACE WILL BE HABITABLE AGAIN? - YES, SIR. - I GUESS OKITA KNEW THE TRUTH SINCE THE BEGINNING. YOU'VE DONE WELL. YOU'RE HEROES, EVERY ONE OF YOU. HUMANITY IS IN YOUR DEBT. - COMMANDER, THE YAMATO WILL REACH HOME IN A MATTER OF HOURS. THE BATTLE FOR EARTH IS AT AN END. - OH, THE EARTH. I HAVE SUCH MEMORIES. - ( explosion ) - ( all exclaiming ) - SIT-REP. - ( alarm sounding ) - LARGE GAMILAS VESSEL AT SEVEN O'CLOCK. - WE'RE ABOUT TO TAKE MORE FIRE. - BATTLE STATIONS, NOW! - All: YES, SIR! - SHIMA, GIVE ME A DAMAGE REPORT. - GET OUT OF HERE. THE WHOLE DECK'S GOING UP. - ( screaming ) - PORTSIDE TURRETS, HIT. - THE HULL CAN'T TAKE THIS KIND OF ABUSE. - THEY HIT THE BAY. THE LAUNCHERS ARE CRIPPLED. - TURRET TWO HAS BEEN DESTROYED. - ( screaming ) - Aihara: CATASTROPHIC ENGINE MALFUNCTION. - TOKUGAWA, WHAT ARE WE LOOKING AT? TALK TO ME! CHIEF? CHIEF, DO YOU READ ME? - SHE MAY HAVE TAKEN QUITE A BEATING JUST NOW, BUT THE OLD GIRL CAN STILL DANCE. - CHIEF? TOKUGAWA, COME IN. - ( rumbling ) - MY GOD. IS THAT A SHIP? - HUH? - YOUR NAIVETY AMUSES ME. - ( all gasping ) - YOU THOUGHT YOU HAD WON? AND WHAT WOULD YOU HUMANS CONSIDER VICTORY? ANNIHILATING OUR PLANET? AS YOU DID. OR RETURNING YOUR PLANET TO A STATE THAT CAN SUSTAIN YOU? - DESLA. NO, YOU'RE NOT HIM. - I AM DESLA, AND I AM NOT DESLA. YOUR ATTACK ANNIHILATED THE MAJORITY OF OUR INDIVIDUAL ASPECTS. I AM PART OF THE FRAGMENT THAT SURVIVED YOUR COWARDICE. OUR MASTER PLAN FOR COLONIZING EARTH HAS BEEN SET ASIDE. MOST OF THOSE WHO WOULD HAVE MADE THE JOURNEY WERE VAPORIZED BY YOUR SO CALLED "SCIENCE OFFICER". IN THE GRAND LEDGER, I SUPPOSE, YOU CAN COUNT THAT A VICTORY. HOWEVER, IT IS A VICTORY BOUGHT AT A GREAT PRICE. - WHAT DO YOU MEAN? - YOU WILL NEVER SET FOOT ON YOUR PLANET AGAIN. WE ARE AN ANCIENT RACE, FULL OF PRIDE. AND OUR WRATH IS AS COLD AND DEEP AS SPACE ITSELF. - ( exclaiming ) - LIFE SIGNS NEGATIVE. IT ISN'T HERE. - I'VE GOT A BAD FEELING. - ( rumbling ) WHAT THE HELL? WHAT'S IT DOING? - THE GAMILAS SHIP. THEY'RE GOING TO USE IT AS A BOMB. - THEY'RE TRYING TO DESTROY EARTH. - OH, SON OF A... - NANBU, READY THE GUNS. WE'RE SHOOTING IT OUT OF THE SKY. - Nanbu: KODAI, SIR. THERE'S NOTHING LEFT. - WHAT DO YOU MEAN? WE STILL HAVE THE WAVE-MOTION GUN, DAMN IT. - DID YOU FORGET THEY JAMMED THE MUZZLE? IF YOU FIRE THAT GUN, WE ALL DIE. THE YAMATO WILL BE COMPLETELY VAPORIZED. - ( grunting ) - THIS SHOULD BE THE CAPTAIN'S CALL. OKITA? HE'S GONE. ( sighs ) THINK, KODAI. COME ON, USE YOUR HEAD. USE YOUR HEAD. THERE'S GOTTA BE A WAY. THINK OF SOMETHING. ANYTHING. NANBU. IS THERE ENOUGH POWER LEFT TO FIRE THE GUN? - ENOUGH FOR A SINGLE SHOT. BUT AGAIN, IF WE SHOOT IT, THE SHIP WILL EXPLODE. - KODAI, WAIT. - HAVE ALL HANDS ABANDON SHIP. THIS IS AN ORDER FROM CAPTAIN KODAI. - YOU'RE ABANDONING SHIP WITH US, RIGHT? - THIS ISN'T UP FOR DISCUSSION, PILOT. ABANDON SHIP! DR. SADO, EVAC THE WOUNDED. - KODAI, I'M STAYING RIGHT HERE. - NO, SHIMA. - YOU NEED ME TO KEEP THE SHIP STEADY. - SHIMA, LISTEN TO ME. IF YOU'RE HALF THE HELMSMAN I THINK YOU ARE, YOU NEED TO USE YOUR SKILLS TO GET THE CREW BACK TO EARTH. - DAMN IT. - LOOK AT ME. YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN GET YUKI TO EARTH, AND IF THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN, ALL OF THIS WAS FOR NOTHING. - I KNOW, BUT... - I AM THE CAPTAIN NOW. DON'T YOU GET IT? I GO DOWN WITH THE YAMATO. - KODAI. SHE'S ALL YOURS. - ROGER. - ( machine whirring ) - ALL RIGHT. LET'S GO! - YOU SHOULD JOIN THE OTHERS. I'LL BE RIGHT BEHIND YOU. - I'M NOT LEAVING YOU HERE. - YUKI. - IF YOU CAN REALLY GET OUT OF HERE IN TIME TO BE OKAY, THEN SO CAN I. - I AM GIVING YOU AN ORDER. - I KNOW THAT YOU'RE LYING TO ME. WHAT'S THE POINT OF SAVING THE EARTH IF YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE THERE WITH ME? ( crying ) - YUKI. BEFORE YOU, I WAS ALL ALONE. BUT THEN FATE BROUGHT US TOGETHER. I SHOULD HAVE TOLD YOU THIS BEFORE. ALL I WANTED WAS TO BE WITH YOU, TO KEEP YOU SAFE, AND GIVE YOU A BETTER WORLD. THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN FIGHTING FOR. SO LET ME FINISH THE FIGHT. IF I DON'T SUCCEED, EVERYTHING WE'VE DONE HAS BEEN FOR NOTHING. EVEN IF I SHOULD DIE, IF I CAN HEAL THE EARTH IN THE PROCESS, THEN I'M ALIVE IN EVERY CREATURE THAT CALLS THE PLACE HOME. OKAY?
