We never conceal the truth, no subject is taboo. We try to share everything with each other. This is our family rule. Good morning. Good morning. Say, where'd you cook me up? Cook you up? Where was I invested with life, my destiny-origination? A love hotel. - Where? - Wild Monkeys. Wild Monkeys? That monkey billboard in the mall. That love hotel there. And me? Right here, Ko. Where here? Right there. In the refrigerator? But doesn't Wild Monkey sound like you're totally dumb? Kimura Hana was Amsterdam. "I'd like to visit Amsterdam someday, I'm sure I'll feel a sense of nostalgia there," she says. Revolting. She got made when her folks went to Amsterdam to smoke pot. Her name's Kimura Hana? Like the flower? They're definitely ex-hippies. Sure beats Wild Monkeys. Wish I hadn't asked. I wanna die. Your mother didn't like Wild Monkeys, either, but that day, everywhere else was full. Hotel Merry-go-round, Hotel White Parasol, Hotel Mr. Mountain Bear... Each time they turned us down, it only stiffened our resolve. So we settled for Wild Monkeys. Great memory, but then you're an ex-class president. Of course, we're talking Wild Monkeys. Already 16 years since Wild Monkeys. And 17 years since this Grand Urban Maison was built. It's just a housing project. Shit. At least eat your egg. I'm off. I'm off. - I'm off. - Honey, wait, take out the garbage. Sure, sure, I'm off. Off you go. Kyobashi Takashi, Eriko, Mana, Ko Wait, wait "home remodeling is the way to go! "Today's topic... "Remodeling with new wallpaper is the way to go!" Listen... - About your bear... - What? It's pink. Yeah, it's pink. Your bear... How can he bear it? Are you nuts? How can your bear bear it? ...leave a 5 yen coin under your bed, and you'll get lucky in love. A pearl of wisdom. I'll definitely check it out, starting tonight. Happy Birthday, Mummy May 18, 1991 HANGING GARDEN For real? Intense. That's totally intense. Right? Isn't Kimura Hana a creep? No, I can't believe your family discussed it first thing in the morning. It's our family rule that we don't hide anything. In the Kyobashi family, nothing's embarrassing. Wow, intense. That's so intense. No way that would happen in my family. That's because your family's grounded. What? Your feet are on the ground. You're just dissing my family because they're farmers. I'm not dissing them. Being grounded is cool. Nothing cool about it. Oh, I'd like to blow this place up. Why? Thanks to this place we can live in the sticks, but still eat Italian, Balinese, and go to Starbucks. Don't tell me you like Discovery Mall. I'd die without Discovery Center. Totally brainwashed. Listen, Mokki. You asked me what I wanted for my birthday, right? It's not a thing, but there is somewhere I want to go. Where? Hurry up and tell me. That grandma over there, keeled over this morning. Hospitals are just a place to dump old women. Mother, you're smoking! You really should shorten your skirt. You've got zero sex appeal. Is Takashi really keeping up with his work? I mean, the man's over 40. He has to pull that silver spoon out of his mouth and get a real job, so you don't have to work. Mother, why won't you let them operate? I can't stand it, anesthetics and all... - Why? - Why... What, what are you doing! I'm off, then. Wait a minute. Take this and treat Mana on her birthday. It's OK. It's not for you, for Mana. I don't need it. Treat the 3 of you on the sly, without your dumb hubby. Oh, no, pick them up. Don't leave it on the floor. "If you put 5 yen coins under your bed, you get lucky in love." That's what they said on TV. Mrs. Satoko. How are we feeling today? A melon! Hey, my 5 yen coins! Tempura with noodles, ready. Welcome. Sorry to keep you waiting. Here are your orders. Take your time. Thank you. Ninny. Stop calling me that. Sorry, it's just, that's what my Mum calls you. What an amazing coincidence that you and Mum were in the same class, all through school. The manager says your bathroom breaks are too long. And your absentee rate's high. You'll get fired. It's not like soba noodles. You can't just cut off a shit. Ninny, you used to be totally depressed, right? Mum told me all about it. Always alone and super sensitive. Always smiling to cover up. Totally empty Ninny. Oops, was that supposed to be a secret? I have no secrets. Liar, that's impossible. You're so pathetic. Then, why are you smiling? Answer me. Hey, Sacchi, more soba water. Not until after you've eaten soba. Manager, she's got a sexually transmitted disease. What? Chlamy...dai? Chlamydia. She says it hurts when she pees, so she washes it with soba water. The poor girl. Two orders of soba water, please. Hey! Throw out all the soba water! Hotel Wild Monkeys - Here it is. - For real. It's really here? Let's go. Way, way... wait! Way, wait! Hey, wait! Wild Monkeys, huh? Wild Monkeys Hotel's over the top. Hey, there's karaoke. Hey, a revolving bed! I wonder if the bathroom door really doesn't lock... I could probably live here... If, today, just if... If you come inside me and it reaches my ovaries, we'd become an instant family. That's kind of intense. Actually, it's so simple, really. I'll take it off. Sorry. I can't, just can't. So tacky. Don't mind, don't mind. I want to run away. Shall we use Viagra? I can't afford it. I'll get you some for a present on your birthday. Let's do karaoke. I want to stay here forever. "So? "So? "I walk with my back to the streets." You should be ashamed of yourself. A human with no shame is no better than a monkey. Right? We wear clothes and don't have sex in public, because we're ashamed. Excuse me, can I get another beer? I think morals are conceptualized shame. Why don't you smoke in non-smoking buses? Why don't you suck on a young girl's leg? Because you're ashamed. I'm ashamed. That's why people who have no concept of shame are so impossible. I mean, wimps like you. Yes. This is for you. What? Do you know what today is? What day was it? The day you stole my virginity. Oh, right... Can I open it? Because I was raised in a family that couldn't remember my birthday, I want to celebrate the day I became a woman. I'm so thrilled. Thank you, thank you so much. Oh, good. I think that's all for today. I bit your nipple a little too hard You drew a little blood Do it right. I want you to do it right. Stop wimping out and dithering around like some stupid wimp. Stop dissing me and your wife and kids and everyone around you. Get it? Get it? Yes, I'm sorry. Yes? Yes? Yes? Yes. Don't yes me. Bye bye. Mother. Time to go home, you loner. What are you doing here? Dropped in for some snacks. I'll go buy them. Sacchi, the part-timer, started going steady with a guy. and she's always just not showing up. I was late because of a thing over firing her. Lucky her, going steady with a guy. What happened to your teddy bear? Oh, I attached him to Mokki's bag. But you were crazy about that bear. Adultery prevention. Oh, sorry, sorry. Say, seeing as I got home so late tonight, let's call a cab and grab some Balinese food at Discover. Not me, I'm busy. Then I've got homework, too. OK, well, next time, then. Listen, I really think we need 4 keys, one for each of us. But we're one family. I don't want you to come home to an empty home. I bit your nipple... Thanks for the watch. Wear it. My house is this way. I bit your nipple a little too hard... My house is this way. Wear it. Mother keeps insisting she won't be anaesthetized. Lung cancer, right? Let's do it. Surgery is her only option. Then she'll have to move hospitals and we don't have the money. But we've got love. The other day... I looked up how much we still owe on our mortgage. I learned we still owe 30 million yen. All the payments we made these 15 years, went mostly for interest. That's not fair, is it? The world's full of unfairness. Oh, I know. Mana says, she wants to go to the new sushi place in the mall for her birthday. Why not? We'll blow 30,000 yen. Only 30,000? When I ask Ko what he wants to do, he just says, "Whatever". When I ask him what he wants to eat, it's "Whatever". If that's teenage rebellion, it's sure a gutless rebellion. He's probably holding it in. 30,000 yen, huh? Better increase my hours. No, I'll pay for it. Oh, I'm really wiped. Good night, turn out the lights. It's 5 years since we last did it... Thank you, then. Mr. Kyobashi, how's the property? I'll have to consider the matter. A place near the mall that allows 2 mid-size dogs is a prize. Yes, you're right, but I'll take you, Mina, over the dogs. Let go of me, they'll find out. You really can't. Nobody's around at this hour. What is it? That's my son. When are you due? One more month. So soon. You just got pregnant the other day. It'll get faster with the kids growing up. Have the baby before the rainy season. She looks so happy sleeping. Sorry, were you dreaming about getting high? No, dreaming about not having a home, right, Ninny? Give me a soda. You free? Please. You're the only one I can ask, Ninny. This is the last time. Pay me back. One more. I got fired from my job. Thank you. So you do feel guilty? What? For what? Chlamydia. I'll give it to you. What? Really? That manager, I stroked him a little and he came in a second. You've got a teenage daughter, right? Her name's Mana, right? It's probably too late by now. She's probably in Wild Monkeys getting fucked, from front and from behind and everywhere else. Shut the fuck up! Say, Ninny, why do you always have that perfect smile? To keep up the lies? Because you're empty? Stop! If you stick to your story, it stops being a lie. Eriko, huh? What about school? Haven't been to school in a long time. I just get bullied there, anyway. I'd gotten used to the bullying, but getting used to it and asking for it are different, right? How's your family? Mum brings men home so I can't go home, which is just a housing project. What can you do? You call her Mum, but she's just a grown up kid. Scalp a human and we're all just skulls. Not food for humans. Oh right, it's your birthday. That's why I wanted to come to my destiny-origination. We all come into this world crying. And bloody, too. Do you have a family? Would you like to start over? Get married, buy a house, have babies and your own... Your family's finished. Welcome to Babylon, Queen. Start over? It was all over a long time ago. You really are clueless, aren't you? Really are clueless. You really like me, don't you? Don't you like me? You're here because you like me. You wouldn't be here if you didn't. Right? Right? You're not lying, are you? I'll do it myself. I'll do it myself. I think you're a really pathetic human being. Happy Birthday. Boss, my father slipped in the bathroom and hit his head twice... I'm terribly sorry, but could I take the day off... Oh, really? Thank you. Sorry to inconvenience you. Wimp. Wimp. I had a feeling I might run into you. I bit your nipple... - Um... - Yes. I'd like to visit your show room. Can you show me your student ID? I'm home. Welcome home. Honey, a phone. A phone? Won it in a bingo game for our client's new employees. Wow, amazing. I can't believe my bingo luck. Oh, she's Kitano Mina. She's going to tutor Ko. Tutor Ko? This is my Dad. Dad? You always call him, Papa. Shut up, sis. Nice to meet you, I'm Kitano Mina. Just call me Mina, Papa. Ko just brought her home, out of the blue. He saw the flyer advertising tutors in the mall, and called her up himself. He's never shown such initiative, and her monthly fee's reasonable. Even if he doesn't have exams, his grades will matter in high school. Let's eat. Sit down, Papa. Please, sit down, teacher. What's that yellow car? It's a Wimp Q. Another day, Papa. Papa, this beer's totally delicious. Oh, thanks. You, too, teacher. Why, thank you. What? Your bank passbook? Not again. How could you not take something so important to the hospital? Yeah, so, where is it? The Buddhist altar? Hold on. Hello, mother. Hello, nice to see you. I'll bring it later. What is the purpose of a show room, teacher? Well, the show room is for... Cake time... is the way to go. How many times do I have to tell you to knock? Oh, sorry, sorry. Oh, why thank you. I have to go to your grandmother's house. Take your time. Right. And I'll stop by the hospital. OK? You see, if she keeps this up, Eriko won't make it into college. Her attendance is much too low. Why don't you try getting her some counseling. I think she may be mildly depressed. An acquaintance of mine is a doctor. Why don't you consult with him? It's all my fault. The way she turned out is all... it's all my fault. Oh, no, I don't think so. I'm so sorry, it's all my fault. Oh, no, that's not true. - That's right. - Please, be strong. - It's not a matter of assigning blame. - It's my fault. My marriage was all wrong. Her father was the worst sort of man! And she takes after him. I was happy with just my older boy. I never intended to have a second child. Her older brother is such a good boy. I never should've had her. I never should've had her. I never should've had that girl. I never should've had her. I never should've... Die with me! Die with me! Die with me! There is just one thing I'm hiding from my family. That the Kyobashi family was created according to my perfect plan. Mana wasn't an unexpected child. I'd kept track of my cycle since I was 15. I looked for a boy who could make a family, and staked my life on fashion and beauty to catch that boy. I also devoted 3 years of high school to studying only child rearing and home economics. - Don't walk in front. - Don't walk in front. - Don't look this way. - Don't look this way. - Don't breathe. - Don't breathe. Don't wimp out, Ninny. I couldn't fit in. My classmates called me strange names, and collectively ignored me. My high school life was barren and hopelessly empty. The only place I had to go was home, and at home, I was stuck with my mother. I met Takashi when he took a part-time job at the company. I joined after finishing high school. I observed him for one month and made my choice. Hotel Wild Monkeys On his last day, I asked him out and he was easy, inviting me right on to the hotel. I figured he was that kind of guy, but that was hardly relevant to my plans. The crucial question, was when I told him I was pregnant, would he grudgingly accept it or run away. Takashi, I'm pregnant. Really... good... When we moved into the housing project, I thought I had arrived at a shimmering new future. Don't cry, now. Mana, can Mummy have some ice cream? Mmm, yummy. Look Ko. Why's Ko crying? Up so high, high. Stopped crying. Doing the exact opposite of my detested mother. I started my new family. Mama. What's wrong? Did you see a ghost? Don't be scary. This area used to be a cemetery. Cut it out. Mother, are you OK? Yes, I just spaced out a little. Seconds? More beer, Papa? Teacher. In our family, we share everything. Our rule is we hide absolutely nothing from each other. Right, when I got my first period, we had a party to celebrate. And we had a Celebrate Ko's Awakening to Sex Party. Sister! Mama, tell us how you lost your virginity. Right now? Oh, no. No secrets in our family. I'll write it up in a report later. Tell us now, with teacher here, too. When was it... not in front of Papa. It was Papa, after all. That's not what you said before. Tell us. How was it, Papa? Don't... don't ask me. Wasn't it you, Papa? It was Papa. Of course it was Papa. I've only slept with him. That's not what I heard before... A family without secrets is like a love hotel room with no windows. What does that mean? Oh, I don't mean anything strange. It was just a metaphor, nothing more. And do you use them, teacher? Of course not. I'd like to see a room with no windows. Ko, that's a fantastic seduction line. You're a natural. Have you had a Caught Dad Cheating Party? Not yet. No, no, no, no, no. No, no party like that. No, no, no. No, no. It's time for me to go. - Thank you for the lovely meal. - Oh, not at all. - Sorry for not cleaning up. - That's okay. - See you. - Take care, then. - Take care, teacher. - Thanks. Going on a date, now? Maybe that's a secret. See you, Ko. Thank you. Do your homework. See you, take care, bye bye. Honey, there's no more beer. Guess I have to go buy some. No more beer... Reeks of perfume. Ko, can you clean that up? Do you ever get horny for your teacher? She's got big tits. I don't get horny for her. But her breasts are big. Hmmm. How's the studying going? I'm realizing what my weakness is. What's your weakness? I get too obsessed. But it's important to be obsessed. If you really want to be beautiful, or be cool, you tend to get what you want. Even this place, I really wanted to live here, and I got to. At the time, this was the place everyone coveted. I thought, "I got what I wanted! Now our family can be happy". That's what I mean by obsessed. When you get obsessed, you shut out reality. Mina, I wanted to see you. You see me every week. I'll go to the store. More... Lady, no smoking or cell phones allowed. Don't you hear me? No smoking, look. The No Smoking sign. I'll throw you off the bus. D... D... Driver... What a drag. I'm his guardian, Kinosaki Satoko. My grandson caused you so much trouble. How can I apologize... What a provincial department store. Got me out of a jam, thanks, Sacchan. Not so fast. What? I'm your guardian. Sorry, did you buy it? Who's she? Sacchan. Sacchan? I'm his guardian, Kinosaki Satoko. I thought I had money... You got caught shoplifting? I had to get her, she's my guardian... Why did you bring your grandma? It's too surreal. What does surreal mean? Have fun with your grandma. Don't "grandma" me. Want me to set your hair on fire? When you ask a kid to shop for you, the mature thing to do is to give him enough money. How much? How much were the tampons? What a drag. I'm not asking for the money. Dragging a kid to a place like this. What if his parents find out? You've got parents, don't you? No, I don't. Well, excuse the fuck out of me. Go ahead and tell his parents. Ko, why not learn how to fuck from an experienced, mature woman. Fax? Send it where? Teacher. Ko... Tell me the truth. How far have you gone with her? This? This? Or... This? Did you get this far? I haven't gone anywhere. I just heard that love hotels don't have windows, so I had her bring me here. You're right, there are no windows. I'll take you to the hospital. Maybe I'll rest here. The bath looks nice and big. All right, but you have to swear not to tell Mum. No, I won't. You need bus fare? I've got it. But thanks. We all come into this world crying. And bloody, too. Hey, Kyobashi! What are you doing, Mokki, running up the stairs? Did you hear? What? Discovery Mall has to halt development. Way to go. What? Justice prevails, after all. Oh, and you know. You gotta stop calling me Mokki. It's way too tacky. See you. I'll meet you at your new place. The Taniis from the 10th floor moved out. It's getting so lonely here. I wonder who'll move in to their place. Who'd want to move in here? Oops. Who needs human company... What a drag. Wow, amazing. Thanks to you. Shhh, that's a secret. But why have a party for me tonight? Because it's your birthday. That's not what I mean. Why is your family celebrating my birthday? We share anything with strangers but not with each other. Hello, everything's ready. Coming. Mama, you're over-frying these. Maybe not... My mother, Sacchan. It's her birthday, today, too. I'm Kinosaki Satoko. This is Mina, Ko's tutor. Thank you for looking after Ko. Not at all. I'm always being fed here. Where's Dad? He's late. You should always tell him an earlier time. He's such a pussyfoot. Oh, all right. Let's start without him. I'm home! Papa, you're late. - I missed my bus. - Welcome home. Thank you for working late. Mother, it's been a long time. Takashi, you're always the picture of fortitude and manliness. Sit down, Papa. Is wine OK, teacher? Please. No wine for you, mother. I can have a toast. This could be my last birthday. Right, Takashi? Drink up. You're so sweet, teacher. Well, then. In honor of Mina's 22nd birthday and Sacchan's something-or-other birthday, here goes, Happy birthday to you... Mina, Sacchan, congratulations! Cheers. Let's eat, let's eat. Please, eat up. Dad, you seem a little down. Is it because Sacchan's here? I know, it's a school play. This is a school play. This is exactly like a kindergarten play. They all know the truth, but they're acting like a happy family. A school play. I get it. This is a school play. Teacher, are you OK? "Teacher, are you OK?" You're good at mimicking Ko. Right? What's wrong with a school play? It's fun, isn't it? Why not be happy to be alive? It's your birthday. Mother, I didn't know you smoked. I haven't been able to quit since 18. Can't quit. May I smoke one? Sure, feel free. Thank you very much. Here, teacher. You said you didn't like women who smoke. I had quit... Hotel Wild Monkeys... Do you frequent love hotels? Well, most days when I come here. Are you drunk, teacher? You could get alcohol poisoning. So, the question is... Who is with me then? I'll go buy some beer. We've got another case. Some harder stuff, then... After you hear the answer. No. 1, Papa. No. 2, Ko. No. 3, Sacchan. Call her a taxi. And the answer... Really, Mama, call her a taxi. You OK? Teacher, are you OK? Teacher, I brought you some water. Can I come in? Are you OK? I'm coming in. Are you OK? You'll feel better if you throw it all up. Drink all that water up. You OK? It's acute alcohol poisoning. Turn on the TV? I've lost my appetite. "...thing is, I don't want him to wimp out." "I totally want him not to wimp..." What a totally stupid show, sorry. Would you read these outside? Don't leave them in the toilet. What am I supposed to do? We haven't done it in 5 years. Bet you've got cobwebs down there. Hey, she looks exactly like Mana. What? Exactly like her. Idiot! She doesn't look anything like me. I can't believe you buy these, Papa. You're the worst, disgusting. What am I supposed to do? We haven't... Because you're cheating? No I'm not. Oh, what's the big deal. Young people have their own rules about dating. Say, when I was talking with Ko on the phone... Mother, I've told you not to call when I'm not here. I called her to ask her how this place used to be. The reason you thought we could all be happy living here, was because it was brimming with direct sunlight and greenery... That's what she taught you? What is she teaching you? That giant-breasted teacher. Straightening your hair, getting sexy... How about "Thanks for dinner?" Isn't that what you say? Eriko. Ko's just impossible these days. I don't have a clue anymore. Just like an ex-class president. Super mean. Ex-class president? At this rate, Ko might become a "shut-in". Eriko you used to be a "shut-in," too. No way. Of course not. Back then, we didn't have that nifty phrase "shut-in" yet, so you couldn't tell whether she was lazy or sick. I was not a shut-in. They'd tease you, "Ninny, Ninny," and you'd come home crying. Listen, Mother. What is it? Why don't you just die. Maybe I'll have another glass of beer. Hello? Is that Ninny? No, it's not. - I'll answer it. - Why? Not sure why. Hello, Eriko san? What do you want? Listen, I forgot my earrings in my locker at the soba shop. Can I borrow the key? I'll give it right back, can I come over? Listen, you... What? Die. Who was that? Miss Fizz-for-brains. So many girls like that these days. I say it's time for the cake. Yeah, let's have cake. They shot this in Wild Monkeys. You know Wild Monkeys, Sacchan? She's still very much in her prime. This does look exactly like you, Mana. Look. That's why you were curious about love hotels. You do take after your father, Mana. I found a Viagra brochure in your bag. What do you do when cut school? I eat sweets. Meals with liars taste lousy. Thanks for dinner, Ninny. Taka-baby, water. Teacher, let's call you a cab. Are you OK? Taka-baby. Who's Taka-baby? I bit your nipple... Yes, hello? Who the hell are you? I'm Kinosaki Satoko. Who might you be? I'm Mr. Wimp's S-Friend. Oh, it's so nice to meet you. Mr. Wimp, your S-Friend's on the phone. Thanks. Hello, S-Friend Alva Trois. Tell me, is S-Friend French? It means Sex Friend. Oh, I see. Brings back memories. Remember how we'd go out to celebrate birthdays? We'd ride the bus to Sushi Tsune or Gourmet Grill? I have no memories of going out to eat with you. Sure we did. Don't tell me, you're going senile. Maybe you should go back into therapy. Listen, Mother... Why don't you just die. There's too many candles. Too senile to remember your age? Reminds me of funeral incense. Make your incense offering. Don't mind if I do. What... Birthdays are for the survivors. So many people have already died on me. Those I loved, those I hated. But as time passes, you forget them. That's the saddest thing of all. When you're dying, it's as though ordinary memories, gathering dust in an empty well, quietly start to play, like in a silent movie. That's what I've been thinking. Do you remember, when you were 3 or 4, we took a ride on the ferris wheel? You cried for ice cream, but I only had enough money to buy one. But you wouldn't even give me a bite. I kept asking you to give Mummy a bite, but you just shut up and pouted. I got pissed off and slapped you. That scene's been appearing in my dreams, lately. But each time I see it, the dream's a little different. It keeps getting better. I'm revising my memories in my dreams, improving on them. When I think I'll die in this dream, I feel so relieved, not sure why... Having kids is so great. When you have kids, time flows so slowly. And your life follows an orderly cycle. You get your hands on whatever you need. And then you can start over. Start over and do it again. It's your fault I couldn't go to school. Start over, do it again. A mother is supposed to love her child, affirm her child, bring her up well, protect her from hatred and evil point out what's right and beautiful in the world, and protect her against despair and fear. That's what she's supposed to do. Start over. That's what a mother does. Creating that kind of a home is what a mother does. I don't want to keep on smiling. My smile is a prayer, to protect this family, so we can all live happily, every day. Start over... Do it over. You never should've become a mother. You're a failure as a mother. In my next life, when I'm reborn, I'll be your mother and bring you up properly. So why don't you just die. Start over, do it over. Start over. Do it over. Eriko, Mum's looking much better. The reason Mum refused surgery, was because she thought, under anesthesia, she'd just blab everything. What? She'd seen a spy movie, where the guy was afraid he'd spill, so he choose surgery without anesthesia. When the doctor assured her it wouldn't make her talk, she went right under. So, she's got secrets. You know what they are, brother? Live life as long as she has and I'm sure she's got a secret or two. But you'd know better than me. Unlike me, you two get along. What do you mean? You've always gotten along. To this day, you're all she talks about. How you brought her flowers or plants from so-and-so... My wife's had it up to here with it. You tell me her secret and I'll pay for the surgery. Mana? Mum, I'm sorry, I have to stay for practice today. It's hard work making new friends with girls in high school. I might be a little late. OK, then, stick with it. Just don't be too late. Bye, then. Bye, then. Yes, I'm in the tunnel. Well, the situation is, when the dog leapt out, I swerved to avoid him and that's when I ran into it. No, nobody's injured. Teacher Mina, when they built that housing project, did they think, if all the windows were the same size and faced South at the same angle, that they'd all get the same sunlight and everyone would be equally happy? What are you talking about? That's for drying laundry. See ya. No matter how late, he's always home by 10. He'll be fine. Ko's pretty together. Let him go out, once in a while. He's 14 years old. Listen, Papa. If you know where Ko is, tell me. Ko's with Mina, right? You know Mina's cell phone number. Don't play dumb, I know what's what. I'm sorry, actually, I've broken our family rule about no secrets... I don't want to hear your ridiculous confession. Blabbing a secret isn't following the rules. I want you to not have any secrets, to protect our family! - I'll call you back. - Are you listening to me? ...they were trying to steal the cash, when an officer responded to the alarm, arresting them for attempted robbery and murder. In custody are Saito Sachiko, age 20, unemployed, and Yokoyama Katsuo, 25, also unemployed. Suspect Saito had once worked at the restaurant... You're late. Find a new boyfriend? I was at practice. Oh, I see. What's in that bag? Nothing. Papa, are you loving Mama like you should? I think Mum's on the edge, like she might lose it. Something's off. She's always talking to herself, always mumbling. Like "idiot," "die," or "I'll kill you". Something's wrong. Oh, yeah? There's no telling what people will do if they're deprived of love. Why don't you love her, instead of hiding porn. Listen, you were both totally unexpected, but for me to quit college, give up my dream of cycling around Hokkaido, get my act together to get married, get an apartment in the housing project, hunt down a job, always chase after the next job that's even a little bit better, swallow my pride and borrow money from my folks, and when I do stay out, always be home by morning, with hardly a kiss from your mother these past 5 years... But how on earth do you think I can stand it, looking out for our family in our pathetic housing project, if not for love! Right? You're late. What'd you buy? Ko? No, the one that nearly died. What? Say, I had this dream. Remember back when, you cried like a baby, saying that no one in your family ever celebrated your birthday? That we only ever celebrated your brother's? I had a dream exactly about that. Frankly, I never played favorites between you. Sorry, but I don't have time to listen to your stories. Oh, sorry. But the thing is, today's the 18th, right? I wanted to reach you before midnight, so I popped my dentures in and called. Happy birthday. Did you hear me? Happy birthday. Now I'll be able to sleep peacefully. OK, excuse me. Wait a minute! Wait a minute! What's wrong? Where'd you cook me up? Cook you up... Where was I given life, my destiny-origination. Don't ask such a thing. The really important things, you take to your grave. Got that? Sure. That's what I mean by obsessed. When you get obsessed, you shut out reality. A bite of ice cream? Sure. Isn't it yummy, Eriko? Hey, Mama. Hurry, Mama. Maybe she's asleep. - Mama. - Mama. For real? This early? - Mama. - Hey. - Open the door. Think Mama remembers? Bet she's still forgotten. She always remembers our birthdays. Know what this is called? What's it called? A surprise birthday party. - Really? - Sounds suspicious. Right. Wish she'd wake up. She'll let us in when she wakes up. Let's wait, then. Welcome home.
