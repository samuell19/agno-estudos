Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker were the most famous televangelist couple in America, and, by far, the most prosperous. Ken and Barbie of televangelism. And they seemed honest. They brought encouragement and hope to lots of people. He's the president of a multi-million dollar religious organization called the Praise The Lord Club. PTL also operates Heritage Village in Fort Mill, South Carolina. ...Christian Disney World where PTL members can vacation with inspiration. They are among the best-known figures in the world of television evangelism. But tonight they are out of business. ...following the scandal that led to founder Jim Bakker's resignation last week. There's debate about how much the Bakker scandal will hurt all the television ministries and quiet concern... Modern warfare among the TV preachers. In this electronic age, the stakes are high - with millions of followers... - ...and recriminations. And caught up in the fighting are their fellow evangelists Jimmy Swaggart, Oral Roberts, Jerry Falwell. Now, about what some people around here are calling "pearly-gate." Pearly-gate is the story of Jim and Tammy Bakker. It's remarkably like Watergate, which tainted the name "politician," and such an episode is bound to taint the name "preacher." The Bakkers couldn't even get out of their car. There were so many people waiting to see them after three months of seclusion. ...busloads of tourists, hoping to get a glimpse of the elusive evangelists, but they had no better luck than the waiting newspeople. Okay, I'm gonna start by taking some of this off. Okay. Gonna take your foundation off. M'kay. And then we'll start fresh. Can you take your lips off? - Okay. - Do you want a little remover? Oh, no. That's it. That'll be all. They're permanently lined. Oh. And my eyes are permanently lined and my eyebrows are permanently on, so there's not a whole lot you can do. My goodness, - I... I didn't know. - Mm. Have you never done pictures without those eyelashes? Nope, and I never will because that's my trademark. And, you know, if I take that away, then it's not me, and no one's gonna wanna look at me without my trademark. So, I hold onto that. Even if we softened 'em up and kept... No. No, you can do anything you want, but my eyelashes stay right where they are. That's really you. Mm. Oh, yeah, this is who I am. I didn't know what the words "glory" or "hallelujah" be because the devil is all around us! Oh, yes, he is! And it's up to you to resist his temptations. Hallelujah! If you're not saved by Jesus, you open yourself up to demons and the devil will make a home in you! Glory to God! When God spoke peace to my heart, I didn't know how to say glory or hallelujah, but I got saved! I leapt upon that altar. Jesus told me He loved me, and He will love you. He speaks through her. Say, "Hallelujah!" Hallelujah! She is with the Holy Spirit right now! Feel the spirit! Say, "Glory. "Glory to God." Glory to God! You too, sister! Feel the spirit. Raise your hands up, folks. I was here. Here the whole time. Little girls go to Hell for lying. Honest and true. I wanna be saved. If you let me come in with you, God'd love me like He's supposed to. There's reasons you can't be seen in church, Tam. Grown-up reasons. Is it because everyone thinks you're a harlot? And I come from a time before Fred made you respectable and stuff. Only reason they let me back is 'cause nobody but me can play the piano. But you remind them I was divorced. They see you, all of us is going to be banished. The souls of all your brothers and sisters burning in Hell because you don't listen and you can't sit still. Stop performing. You're going to Hell, Tammy. You don't belong here. You don't belong anywhere. You're ugly. You've got a demon inside you. But I don't wanna go to Hell. If they loved you, they wouldn't leave you here. They love me. They love you not. Jesus, come into my heart and forgive me my sins. I don't know what this is everybody's getting, but if it's real, then, please, Jesus, give that to me. Amen! Be strong in the Lord and His mighty power. Put on the armor of God so that you can take your stand against the devil's schemes. For our struggle isn't against flesh and blood, but against the powers of this dark world! Casting down imaginations on every high thing that exalts itself. - Do you feel love? - Yes. You feel it, sister! I know you feel it! You too, brother? If you feel the love, - say, "Hallelujah!" - Hallelujah! - Say, "Glory to God!" - Glory to God! Accept the blood! Feel love forever! Hallelujah! Praise the Lord! Are you ready to accept the love? Yes. Tammy Faye! I'm so sorry. I'm so, so sorry. No, Tammy! Tammy, get up. He is with us! She's peeing herself! Praise God! Yes! - Tammy, I said get up. - Shush now. This baby is a miracle. Don't you take her from us. Mr. Bakker? Yes, sir? Thank you. Um, sorry. I would like to start with a verse. "Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper "and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth." That is John 3, verse 2, and it's written right here in the good book. He gave me this verse last night. God, He came right down and He whispered it in my ear. He said, "Jim Bakker, "I intend for you to thrive, "to live, and to love "in this life." He said it to me. But us Christians, we've been taught that we're supposed to expect failure. When Jesus calls you home, you think you're going to get a bonus if you make yourself miserable? You think if you deny yourself indoor plumbing, or if you don't have shoes on your feet... I'm... I'm sorry. Go ahead. You know, Heaven, Heaven is heaven, that is for sure. But God's hope for us is that we live and we thrive and we love here in the promised land. Here and now. Here and now, and in this very, very moment. Hallelujah! God does not want us to be poor! Oh, no! He will gift the faithful with eternal life, eternal love, and eternal wealth! Hallelujah! Praise God! Praise Him! Be right to remember, "Blessed be the poor," Mr. Bakker. Doesn't sound very blessed to me. You two are here to learn the ways of the Lord through scripture, yeah? Yes, sir. And to spread the word of God. Oh, yeah. You know, I'm gonna sing the word in every tent, in every church. You know, God told me that that's what He wants for me. With makeup on your face? Ahem. Jezebel. "I do my best to maintain always "a blameless conscience, "both before God and before men." "A man who keeps company with harlots "wastes his wealth." Proverbs 29:3. "Your stature is like that of a palm and your breasts "like clusters of fruit. "I will take hold of the palm tree." "And I will take hold of the fruit." That's the Song of Solomon. 7:7. I'm sorry I couldn't drive you someplace nice. Oh, this is someplace nice, Jim. Tell me something. Tell me a secret. Something that no one else knows about. Oh, I have no secrets. I'll tell you anything you wanna know. We'll start with everything. Okay. I'm the oldest of eight children and I'm a very practical person. And what you see is all there is of me. You know, I don't pretend to be something I'm not because what you see is all you get. And I love people. I have a genuine, genuine love for people. And I hurt when people hurt, and probably a little more dramatic than people would like me to be. But I enjoy that. That's just who I am. I've never met anyone quite like you, Tammy Faye. Okay. So, um, do you have any secrets, Jim? Well, one or two. Well, tell me. Well, before God found me, I wanted to be a radio deejay. - No. - Yes. I used to love to make people dance. Have fun. Little Richard. And Buddy Holly and... Oh, and Fats Domino. What happened? Why didn't you do it, Jim? Ah. Never mind that. Tell me. Um, I don't think... Well, all right. I'll tell you, Tammy. Um... Two years ago, I was on a date with my girlfriend, Sandy, and... - Mm. - Oh, no, with my girlfriend at the time. - Mm. - But, anyhoo, I borrowed my daddy's car to take her out, and there was all this snow on the ground and Fats was singing Blueberry Hill so loud and I... I was having these urges that only the devil would approve of and I lost control of the car. And I ran over a little boy, little Jimmy Summerfield. I ruptured Jimmy Summerfield's lung... ...with my daddy's tire. I didn't sleep all night. I was just up worried sick about that boy dying. So, I... I made a bargain with God. I said to Him, "I will forsake my dream of being a deejay. "I will stop peddling in rock and roll "and I'll dedicate my life to Him and Him alone. "If He sees fit to save that boy's life, "He will win two souls right then and there." And what happened to Jimmy Summerfield? He lived. - Oh. - Yes. - Praise be to God. - Yes, praise Him. So... You still like me? Oh, sure, I do, Jim. Oh, even more now that you were honest with me. I'll tell ya, I do miss dancing. I found my thrill On Blueberry Hill I found my thrill When I found you You're so loud. Dance with me, Jim. Here? No, I can't. In front of all these people? Like, no... Please? The moon stood still On Blueberry Hill And lingered until My dreams came true Oh, we can't. I know. - We can't. - I know. Oh. Oh, we can't. I know. Yeah! What'd you do? Hello, Mother. This is Jim Bakker, my husband. Hello, Mother. Oh, it's such a blessing to finally meet you. No. No, Mother, we can't go back to school. They have a rule against students marrying one another. Did you know they had that rule when you did this? If I know the two of you, you're just gonna love Jim. Oh, he's so motivated. He has so many big ideas. Did you know? Well, you can educate yourself right out of a relationship with God. He has a plan for us. - God or that Jim boy? - God. What'd He tell ya to do this time? Come spring, me and Jim are going to be traveling preachers, bringing God's love to all people. Anyone who's hurting or they feel like they've been left out. Jim will preach and I'll sing. And we'll be like Oral Roberts and his wife. Oral Roberts went to college. He has one named for him. God said that we're supposed to have a good life. That way, we can help bring his love to all people. There's a limit to God's love, Tammy Faye. No. No, there's no limit to God's love, Mrs. Grover, and there's no limit to Tammy Faye and I either. We're soldiers in Christ. We've been called to serve in a very real way. God smiles on a husband and wife. "As a young man marries a young woman, "so will your Builder marry you; "as a bridegroom rejoices in his bride, "so will your God rejoice in you." Isaiah 62:5. It's something we do. Fred said that we could stay until the weather changes. Got some bubbles at the swap meet. I'm sorry, Tam. I feel like I'm letting you down. She doesn't like me. - No, Jim. - No, she doesn't. Of course she likes you. Oh. It makes Tammy sad to see you so sad. How's there supposed to be bubbles if there isn't enough water to work up the bubbles? Oh, I can work up the bubbles, Jim. All I gotta do is dunk my hand. And I swirl... And swirl. Am I doing that all right? Uh-huh. Well, hello there, Tammy Faye. Hello, Mommy. What are you doing with those things? Well, we're gonna use these puppets as part of our sermon and show the kids how wonderful God is. And if we can get enough children to come, they'll bring their mothers and their fathers. And before you know it, we'll have our own church. Have you counted your blessings today, Tammy Faye? No, not yet, Susie. Time to count your blessings, for they are plentiful. Okay, well, thank you for my husband. Oh, you're so welcome, Tammy. And thank you for Mother's understanding, even if she doesn't understand. Oh. You're welcome. And thank you, God, for love. Hmm. Jim! Whose car is this? No. Get in. Get in. Come on. Okay. Roll that window up. I got the heat on. This fine vehicle with the leather interior and the chrome on the wheels is a gift from God for us to do His work. But how can we afford it, Jim Bakker? Who is this? I'm Susie Moppet. Aren't you cute? Well, do you know about God, Susie? Oh, I do. Well, God has cancelled the claim of poverty and deprivation in our lives and He has placed all the powers of heaven and the First Bank of International Falls, Minnesota, at our disposal. Oh. Oh, this is the nicest car I've ever seen, Jim. "Everything works for good for them that love God." Everything. But you have to have faith in Him and in me and in us, 'cause if you don't, I don't know what I'm doing here. - Oh, I do, Jim. - You do? Does she, Susie? Oh, she do, Jim! She really, really do! You sure... It's all right here. In Psalm 37:4. "Take delight in the Lord "and He will give you your heart's desires." God starts turning those wheels in your life! You better believe it! - Oh, now who is this? - Oh, I'm Susie Moppet. Well, hello there, Susie Moppet. Hi! Nice to meet you! She jumped up. Yes, Jesus loves me Yes, Jesus loves me Yes, Jesus loves me The Bible tells me so Hitch up your wagon to God. He's greater than any problem. Us Christians, we're just stuck in the mud like that old game. Remember that old kids' game? God wants us just to run free. Well, this is a fun song, boys and girls. So, hit it, Allie. Jesus loves me This I know For the Bible tells me so Yes, Jesus loves me The Bible tells me so You're watching Pat Robertson on the Christian Broadcasting Network. Come on. Season all your grain offerings... Oh, come on! - Okay, okay, okay. - ...with salt. Do not leave the salt of the covenant of your God out of your grain offerings. Add salt to all your offerings. You know, he's not terribly dynamic for a charismatic. I know, but people just eat him up. ...focus on the foundation. - Tammy, did you see that? - Hmm? Watch close. Every now and again, he glances up at the camera. It is upon Him that you can place your strong... - See that? - You're right. He's talking right to you in the comfort of your living room. Well, if I could have watched a preacher on TV in my own home telling me about God, that would've made such a difference. Mm. Amen. Especially from someone who preaches as good as you do, Jim. - You think? - Oh, yeah. ...blow your home over? You know, we could do that. You're so much more handsome than he is. Keep calling. Gotta do my homework, baby. The numbers are on your screen. Mm. Stop it. You're distracting me. ...voices of angels. I hope you enjoy them, and we have a variety... Well, we'll have to call the preacher down in Raleigh and let him know we got a better gig down here. Don't make him cross at you, Jim. We wanna have him want us back. Hold on. What? The car. I... I... I parked it here. Yep, you sure did. Uh-huh. Well, must've got stolen... What? Oh. Oh, maybe it got towed. No, I know I made the payments, so... I think I made the payments. Oh, Jim. Maybe they didn't get the payments or maybe... Oh, no. I don't think I forgot. - I think I... - Okay. - Oh, Tammy, I don't know... - We need to pray. Oh, did I? Yes, yes, yes. Oh, Lord, we are good soldiers. - We are here for good. - Oh, I'm sorry, Tammy. - We are here for your good. - I'm so, so, so sorry. And we ask that you shine your light... I shouldn't have put so much faith in that bank. God, I'm so sorry. Jesus, I'm so sorry. Tammy, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Jim. Hey. Hey, I saw you preach last night. Those puppets of yours filled me. Deeply. Oh, thank you. Thank you. I'm staying in the room next door. - Can I help you with that? - No! Well, that's very kind of you... ...but we don't rightly know where we're carrying it to. I work at a local television station with a minister by the name of Mr. Pat Robertson. He'd get a kick outta you two. Yes, honey, and that's $25 a pledge. CBN. Can I take your pledge? Well, I'm trying to focus. And you're just distracting me. You make me laugh. I was happy to find... You're so funny, Graham. - Jim? - Hey, honey. Hi, I got a new outfit for the show. Oh, yes, I love it. - Jim. - Yeah? You didn't even look at me. Oh. I'm sorry, Tam. Have I ever told you that I am the luckiest man on the face of this planet? Have I ever told you that? - Not today. - Not today, no? I'm going to tell you something, too, but I'm not gonna tell you right now. You're gonna have to wait. - No, no, no! - Yeah. You just have to. And there he is. Every time I try and talk to him, he just keeps making excuses not to see me. Well, my surprise is gonna make you feel so much better. I'll be right back. No, Jim, - the show's about to start. - Hey, Pat! - Jim! Hey! - You got a second? Have you given more thought to our show idea? All right, let me get you set up. Don't you already have your hands full with those puppets? Biggest earner we got. You stay focused. Well, yes, of course, but you shut down CBN at 10 p.m. Why not do a late-night show? Just kind of like Johnny Carson for Christians? No, Christians don't stay up that late. Oh, I do. - I don't sleep at all. - What about Tam? Well, she's gonna miss you at night. - Tammy loves the idea. - Tammy, we're on. Okay, we're live in five, four, three. Oh, hello, everybody! Hi, Tammy! Well, Jim is a little bit late today, so, um, the theme of today's show, how about we make it all about the importance of being places on time, hmm? Oh, no! Oh, no! - I'm sorry, kids! - There he is. I'm sorry, Tammy! I'm sorry, everybody. I was just having a little, fun little chat with Uncle Pat just behind the barn. Oh, yeah, and what'd you two fellas get up to without me? Oh, well, it's actually something all you kids... - Mm-hmm. - ...are gonna wanna tell your parents about. It's a brand-new show just for them right here on CBN! Well, amen! And it's gonna be called The 700 Club. Now, isn't that happy news? Hallelujah! Yes! Yes! - Hi, kids. - Oh. Hi, Susie Moppet. Hi, Jim. Today's a happy day. Isn't it, kids? And you know why, Jim? Why, Susie? Well, you're gonna have a new show, kids. Yes. And Jim is gonna have a baby. Look at Tammy, she's right behind you. We're gonna have a baby? Isn't the world just full of blessings, Jim? Huh? That's right, folks! We're gonna have a baby! Oh-ho-ho! It's not a drag to be saved. It's not a boring thing. That's religion. See, you got 'em mixed up. Religion is boring and dull, but Jesus is life. Now, my next guest is a new friend to The 700 Club, and I can smell his chicken, yes. The Colonel, Colonel Sanders in The 700 Club! Oh, the crowd appreciates you. I think they like you. I think they're wanting some of that chicken. I guess the housewives of America are thanking you for fixing dinner... Hello. Oh, hi, Mom. Do you know what time it is? Why are you calling so late? Well, Jim says that I need to rest for my pregnancy, but, oh, you know me. I can't rest, so thought I'd call my mother to keep me company. I never got a rest. Oh, I miss working, though. You know? It's so lonesome at home all by myself. Wow! Oh, wow! And he barely touches me anymore. And when he does, it's not enthusiastic. Well, it's up to the wife to make herself desirable for her husband. I do that. Oh, I do. He's just really busy. Really? So, are you watching Jim's show? That new talk show of his is on. Serving God don't feel like it should be a money-making opportunity. Yeah. You know, I wanna do what he's doing. And I wanna sing and not in a puppet voice. And I wanna talk about issues that affect people's daily lives. And there's so much that we don't talk about. There's so many secrets, and, you know, everyone says I'm supposed to be tired, but I just wanna love people. You got me out of bed to talk to me about how you're not tired. Does that make sense to you? No. - Sorry. - Night night, Tam. Take care. Good night, Mom. I love you. Bye. Okay, bye-bye. Who was it? That was Tam. How is she? Well, it seems like she's having some trouble with the pregnancy. What'd I miss? ...a second childhood. I don't know. The sound was off. You love kids, don't you? - You love children. - I do. I have five grandchildren and 14 great-grandchildren. Wow! I bet they're spoiled. Do you spoil them? Oh, dear Lord God. What doors are you gonna open up for me to walk through? What can I do for happiness? Oh, I wanna get back on TV. I'm going back to work for you. Well... What do you think he pays himself? Oh. I should have worn the other dress. You look fine, honey. Oh. There he is. Dede's wearing a mink. That's a real mink! And it's warm outside. You know, we... we paid for all this, Tammy. You and me, from the swimming pool to the hot tub, and Dede's dead animal. We paid for it. Well, the fruit isn't dropping our way, that's for sure. My little stars! Hello. Hey, Pat! - What a beautiful place! - How are you? - Oh, thank you, thank you! - Paradise! Look at that little baby, too. Positively a chipmunk. Thanks. Hey, that's a nice coat. Oh, thank you, dear. Must be hot though. No, not in the least. Oh. Hey, Jim, I've been thinking. Mm-hmm? - Have you given any thought to taking some time off to be with your family? These times do not come back. - No. - Trust me, they are precious, precious times. - No, sir. - Mm. I can do The 700 Club for a time. We can air reruns of Jim and Tammy for a few weeks. - Hmm. - A couple of months even. What do you think? It's very... It's very kind of you, Uncle Pat. Thank you. But, you know, I got that bond going with my audience, you know? We're on the up-and-up. I couldn't think of abandoning them right now. - Well, we'll think about it. - Oh, Pat, Pat, Pat! - Oh. - He came. Oh, my goodness! - Hello! Hello! - Honey. - I see, I see him. - Go say hi! I know, I see him. We'll sit down, we'll sit down. Was your drive in okay? - Jim, go say hi! - I don't wanna say hi. I'm fine. We'll say hi later. You remember Jim and Tammy Faye? Hey, now, the puppet people! Oh, my goodness, just... What a pleasure, Mr. Falwell. A pleasure and a blessing. You are truly an inspiration to me. It's an honor. Nice to meet you, Jerry. I'm Tammy. Tammy Faye and this is Sissy. Aren't the three of you as cute as a button? - Aw! - Yes, sir! It's a moral issue... ...feminist revolution. You know it was fate. It was when my youngest was being baptized, she was such a little-bitty thing that we had to put a little milk crate in the baptismal for her to stand on. Come on, let's go see Daddy. Hi! Could I sit down? I have the baby, you know. It's kinda hard to eat and, you know... Sure. Um, yeah. Using the fork and the knife at the same time and, you know, get the food to my mouth. Well, why don't... - I think... - And I wanna hear all this interesting stuff. - Yeah, but... - Honey... Well, I'll be right back. - Tam. - Oh. She's a firecracker, Jim. - Jim. - Yes. Come on. Okay. Okay. Well, very nice. As you were saying, Jerry? Let's call me Reverend Falwell. Of course. Young people today are raised on television. It's taught them an immorality. But now, we are on television. When I created The 700 Club, all I needed was 700 people to keep us going. A year later, we're in six markets and growin'. Hundreds of thousands of folks are hearin' the word. Now, God has a voice in this fight. - Amen. - Mm-hmm. Mm. Who's He fighting? The liberal agenda. The feminist agenda. Homosexual agenda. It's time for a reversal of these trends. The only hope's in saving America. Get back to the good old days. Mm. Mm. Well, I love our country, but America is for them, too. Uh... Well... - Oh, Tam? - Mm? Will you mind getting me another Coke? Jim, let your wife speak. Debate. I think it gets us all back to unity. Oh, I don't want to debate you, Jerry. I love you. - I love all of you guys. - Reverend Falwell. Um... We love you, too, Tammy Faye. Yes, we do. God as my witness, I made a pledge to continue to expose the sins in this country. The Bible explicitly forbids homosexuality. There's no gray area. Mm. Well, you know, I don't think of them as homosexuals. I just think of them as other human beings that I love. You know, we're all just people made out of the same old dirt. And God didn't make any junk. Right, honey? - Tammy? - Hmm? - Tam. - Hmm? You can't... What are you doing? I'm changing the baby, honey. You can't talk to him like that. That's the big boss man. We need him to like us. - Jim. - No, Tammy. Look, listen to me. I'm trying to build something here. I'm not messing around. God told me He wants me to have what Pat has. But if you keep acting like that, if you keep talking to Falwell that way, I'm not gonna ever get there. Well, God's been talking to me, too, you know, Jim? And He said that I gotta speak up. So, here goes. You can't leave me at home all alone, feeling unloved, and useless. And He said that I belong on TV just as much as you do. And that I should sing and I should be funny. And I should talk about real things for grown-ups. Just, you know, just the way you do. And... He says I'm not gonna tell people who's going to Hell, Jim. We're in the business of healing people. Yes. Jerry Falwell's a powerful man, Tammy Faye. Jim Bakker is a powerful man. Jim Bakker. Yes, he is, Tammy Faye Bakker. I'm so, so sorry. I forgot my own strength... and my manly duties. It's okay. You know, we built CBN in four years and we could build our own in half that. Yes, I think we can. Oh, yeah, we can. Yes. Jim Bakker is gonna be a builder for Christ. Oh, yes, he will. And Tammy Faye Bakker is gonna sing her gospel all around the world. We are gonna spread His word. Oh, my! Coming to you from Praise The Lord studios in Charlotte, North Carolina, broadcasting live across this great nation.

But the penile implant of the inflatable type is the one that we see here. Mm-hmm. And this is the newest one? Well, it is.

All those people looking at me and clapping. Oh, no. I don't appreciate being bamboozled like that. It's love, Mom. Oh, yeah, that's God's love. Every day, I have rapture. Rapture? You just spent an hour talking about pumping penises. Well, these things happen to people and I'm just being honest about the way that life is. And I'm providing solutions to make marriages better. - Tam, where's the privy? - On the left. Okay. Sit down, Mom. Who paid for this house, Tammy? Well, the ministry makes lots of houses. We've got one for unwed mothers. Wait till you see Kevin's House. Oh, yeah, that one's for kids with special needs. And it's named after a sweet little boy named Kevin. Oh, he's 13 years old and he is the sweetest, tiniest little thing you ever saw. His hands are attached to his shoulders and he has no arms at all. Bless his little heart. Let me show you to your room. Okay, everyone, let's see if I can do this. So, now, you're gonna go in a circle. Oh, mine looks a little bit like it had an explosion. You know what I'm gonna do? 'Cause normally when I use frosting, it's not this thick. I'm just gonna do that. I think it's gonna be pretty. You know, next time, I'm gonna make you guys my fudge. That's the best. I think I've only made that, you know, on the show, like, a couple times. Mm. I know! I wish we had smell-o-vision, so you could smell this. This is really nice. Oh! That one. How much time do we have? 10 minutes, Tammy. Oh, goodness! Hey, Mom. Did you see the show? Wasn't that fun? I'm not sure what's so Christian about decorating a cupcake. Oh, Mom, you're so funny. - Have you seen this? - Hmm? From The Observer. Picture of you and Jim on the front. Ah. "PTL's Bakker diverts ministry funds "for new building project." What's that about? Well, you can't believe everything that you read in the newspapers, Mom. How's Fred doing? Is he settling in okay? Smoke and fire idn't just the providence of Hell, girl. You know when I saw that clipping with my face on it, I thought for a second that you were proud of me. I'm hearing there are articles like this in the paper every day. The secular press hates us because we're winning millions of souls for Jesus. Oh, Tammy Faye. You follow blindly. In the end, all you are is blind. I don't know how to do it. I just need it done. That is your job. Yes. Yes. God bless you. You wonder why I don't snuggle you. Maybe it's all that goopy stuff on you. Well, it's better than spending the night with an alligator. Oh. That newspaper. She saved it like it was a little treasure. It made me feel so rotten. Well, your mother's never been all that nice to you. Yeah. Some people just don't change. We're not doing anything wrong, though. Is that a question? No. Tammy, sometimes, I fear that what God wants of me is beyond my abilities. I'm building so much for Him in His name and for His people. - Yeah. - And... And He's giving me more visions every day. Giving me more orders all the time. And then, every day, these creditors... ...and the people who are asking me to save them. I'm only one man. I'm only one man, Tammy. Oh, Jim. Well, I only need one man. You're enough, honey. Okay, come on. Come to bed. Honey, it's been two months, and we said we were gonna try to have another baby. Tammy, I need your help. I need you not to get in my way. And I need you to not ask more of me than I can give. Okay. Do you wanna talk some more? Can you... Can you talk to God? I'm so tired and... Yes? I'll call you right back. I'll take it downstairs. Don't give up You're on the brink Of a miracle Don't give up Remember you're not alone People, don't give up You're on the brink Of a miracle Don't give up on the brink Of a miracle Don't give in God is still on the throne He's on His throne Don't give up You nailed it. Really? This is sublime. This is top drawer. You really think so, Gary? I know so. Your opinion means so much to me. I haven't been this excited about working with an artist since I produced Monster Mash. That's really sweet. We could get a Grammy. - Really? - Really. Tammy, it's time to go. Time for the shoot. Come on. We're... Can you hear me? Can you hear me? - Yeah. - We've been looking for you, so, let's go. We're live in 15 minutes. Hey, hey, Jim, how are ya? Blessed, Gary, blessed. I'm sorry, Jim. You know, I got lost in the music. Gary here, he just makes it all so awesome. Wait till you hear it. You're going to love it. No, it's her voice, Jim. I just turn the knobs here. She sings like an angel. Well, I'm never giving you back to Nashville, oh, no! It's such a beautiful way to connect, Jim. It's God's voice through my voice. To the world's ears. The things you say, Gary. Tammy! You're not camera ready. You know everybody's waiting for you and it's a big day. We gotta do 400 K today. Can we shake a leg, please? Thank you. I'm sorry to drag her away, Gary. Okay! Shake a leg, please. Sure thing, Mister. Thank you. - Jim. - Thank you, Gary. - Tam? - Mm? Ta-da! I made it! 30 seconds, everyone! Light on one, please! Hmm. How's that? Yeah. And we're live in five, four, three, two... Tammy and I are undergoing the most vicious attacks in the history of this ministry. By now, perhaps you think that we should be used to these attacks. But it's been going on for a long time, Tammy. Oh, yeah, that's right, Jim. It's been going on a long time. We are being persecuted by the secular press who simply do not want you to receive the word of God. It is a witch hunt. And on top of this, we have numerous past due bills... that must be paid if we want to save the entire network and stay on the air delivering the word of God every day. So, now is the time for our prayer warriors to rise up because we are in a war. You know, Tammy and I, we just hate to do this, but if every person watching could double their pledge right now, that way, we can save the word of God. I'm talking about salvation. Yours, mine, PTL's, the entire world's. So, together, if we agree together, let's give the devil a black eye. Oh, the phones are ringing. Oh. Praise Jesus and praise you! And God bless you! God bless you! Hallelujah! And don't forget, remember, God loves you. - He really, really does. - He really does. Cut! Very good, everyone. That was not bad. How was that? - How was it? - Uh, that was good, Jim. - We need to talk. Now. - Jim, it was great. We're still gonna be over budget on that... I just want the sleeves a little shorter. Everything's about proportion. Okay, you ready to see? Close your eyes. I love it, Mother. Oh, Sissy, you look so beautiful, baby. Thank you. Golly Moses, this thing weighs a ton. Oh, goodness. Why do you have to do so much shopping, Tam? Well, I have to get my exercise somehow. And, plus, I don't wanna balloon up with the new baby coming. Hey, everyone, come here, come here. Now, when she comes out, make sure you all tell her how great she looks, okay? You know, she hasn't had enough love in her life, and it's time that we all change that. Go on. Good grief. You look so good! Come here. You do. Right? Okay, get up on the pedestal. I am not getting up on the pedestal. - Come on, Grandma. - Come on. - Come on. - Don't push me. Oh! Isn't it fun? We look like triplets. I look like a bear. You look like a beautiful bear. - Oh. It's too much. - No. I already have a coat. I don't need it. Why are you so unwilling to accept the love that God has for you? Can you pay for this? The pledges are rolling in, Mom. People really like the show and they're very happy to accept the love. Take the coat, Mom. Just take the coat. Well... Please, for me. Well, it is attractive, and it's very, very warm. I just feel like a million dollars. - It looks great, Jim. - You think? Yeah, very subtle. I didn't feel a thing. Not a thing. And I played golf the next day. So, we'll have a girl's night. We'll go to Maciano's, get some pasta. Yes, yes. - I love that place. - Yeah? Oh, wait. You know, why don't you go ahead, I'm gonna catch up. - I'm gonna go give Jim a kiss. - Okay. See ya. And that reporter from The Charlotte Observer been poking around. Calling some of our secretaries, asking for comments. I'm gonna put a picture of that guy's butt... ...on a punching bag and I'm gonna use it for practice. We need to talk about the deficit we are running on the expansion to studio... Phooey! Fletcher, no, you're such a worrywart. We're gonna do a telethon next week. The partners will not let us down. Wanda, my nose is shiny. Mm-mm. - Yes, it is. - No. - I'm telling you, Wanda. - It's fine. - A little more powder, please. Your nose isn't shiny, Jim. You're just being fussy. - Oh. - Wanda, tell him he's fussy. You're fussy, Pastor Jim. Oh, how dare you. You're wearing as much as Tammy these days. Careful, you'll end up looking like a clown. - Stop it! You can't talk... - But you know it's true. - You know it's true. - Fletcher. You got Wanda laughing. She's not laughing. What are you laughing at? It's not funny. It's not funny. You guys! Oh, I got a new one. Penny, cover your ears. What did the leper say to the prostitute? - Oh, boy. - What? "You can keep the tip." Oh, shit. Jim, you mean jerk! You're gonna pay for that. I went too far. I went too far. I'm sorry. - I got you now. I got you now. - Wanda! Wanda! Wanda, come here. Come here and powder his nose. - No! No! - "Wanda, help. "Wanda. Wanda. "My nose is shiny." Let me powder your nose. Let me powder your nose. Somebody touched me Hallelujah Somebody touched me Oh, I was blind But praise His name I now can see I was in darkness When Jesus found me But since He touched me I now am free Wow. That was beautiful. That was lovely, Tam. Gary. Aren't you glad He touched you? Truly. Yeah. Hmm. Well, this is perfect. I love this. Well, it's all you, Tam, it's all you. Oh, no. No, no. You know I couldn't do this without you. You know, your voice makes me feel closer to Him. Like He's right here. He is. Tam... when was the last time that you were touched in the way that a woman like you should be touched? Oh, well... I'm eight months pregnant, Gary, so back it up from there. Does his touch tell you how talented you are? Gary. Do his eyes tell you how beautiful you are? Does he listen to you? Does he hear how amazing you are? Tammy. Yes. Can I touch you like that? In that way that you should be touched. You can kiss me - on my neck. - Okay. - Don't leave a mark, okay? - Yeah. Come here. I wanna hold you. - Oh, no. Oh, no. - What? - Leave them on. - All right. Oh, you're so beautiful, Tammy. Oh, you're so big. Oh, yeah. I like this. Yeah. What? What's wrong? My water broke. Mm. You're so beautiful. He's so precious, Jim. Congratulations, Jim. I understand that Gary drove you here? We called the studio, Jim, but you were on the air. Tammy was real upset that you weren't here for it. No... I'm just wonderful, Jim. I'm... I'm so wonderful. We announced his birth on air. We got a real surge in pledges. Praise the Lord. We're gonna get that expansion in Studio 3, thanks to this little miracle. Hmm. Congrats, Jim. This is such a day of joy. A day of celebration, but I just can't help the feeling that something else is going on here. That something depraved taints this day. Depraved is a very big word, Jim. But it's a fitting word, isn't it, Tammy? Yes, Jim. Well, Fletcher's waiting outside and he'll get this man back to Nashville, where he belongs. - Oh, no. Jim, please, no. - Tammy. - Please. - Tammy, I suggest you don't talk right now. Tammy. Tammy, I hope you're not gonna let him do this. Tammy? I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Sorry. I'm so sorry, Jim. I'm so sorry. Can you take the baby away from her, please? Okay. All right. Let me get you something to help you sleep, okay, honey? Yes. That's exactly what I told you. Formal living quarters for some of the staff. Wow! - Yes. - So ornate. Inspired by European architect. And over here, that's the first Christian water park. "We are fishers of men." That's the bait. That's good. I wanted to show you this, too. See, over here... Yes. This is Old Jerusalem. And it's a stunning replica. Oh, it looks beautiful, Jim. - Yeah. - So detailed. You know what they say about details? God is in 'em. - Yes. - That's right. You know, for as long as I can remember, Roe, I've dreamed of a vacation destination for Christian families to come to. A place where they can, um... Hey, Tam. A place where they know that their children are gonna be safe, you know? Sure. We're selling partnerships to fund it. And that way, the partners, they feel the sense of ownership and a pride in this Christian paradise that they've built. Uh... Um, how many partnerships do you have to sell in order to fund it? Hmm. Well... a lot. Yes. You know, because the partnerships we've already sold, they've had to go to funding other projects. - I see. - Yes. But I've been praying on it. I've been hoping that you could advance PTL just a little bit of credit. Just to get the bulldozers moving, you know? Hi, honey. Uh, this is Roe Messner. He's the developer of Heritage USA. Well, I'm not the developer yet. Yeah. Hi. The doctors have had her on so many loopy things since Jamie Charles was born. Pills to make her normal. Pills to make her sleep. Um, as long as she's feelin' better. Yes. Amen. I love what you're trying to do here, Jim. - Mm. - I do. I spent some summers with my wife at Knott's Berry Farm. Every year the jellies got less and less fresh. - Mm. - And I'm convinced it's 'cause they started hiring the wrong kinds of people to make the preserves. I knew you were my man, Roe. But, uh... I'm not a gambler, Mr. Bakker. - Oh, well... - Oh, this isn't gambling, Roe. Oh, no, it's faith. I have seen him perform miracles. Huh. I haven't had anyone claim to be a faith healer to my face since I was about six years old. Well, buildings are miracles. Aren't they, Roe? Well, it's amazing anything ever gets built, that's for sure. Yeah. This is beautiful. We must take a leap of faith for God. Especially when the Devil is makin' us doubt. God's on our side, Roe. Every time we fall, God proves His love again and we come back. We come back bigger, and stronger, and better. "All things work for good to them that love God, "to them who are called according to His purpose." And I called you, Roe. You're welcome. You're owed a "thank you"? He was nowhere near saying yes until I sat down. Oh, yes, to flirt with him. Are you gonna divorce me, Jim? I don't know. I should. But God hates divorce. It ruined your mother. It'll do the same to you. You stopped paying attention to me, Jim. You broke faith with me, Tammy! Gary, he told me that I was beautiful and that I was talented. And he wanted me, Jim. Don't touch me! Gary wanted me, Jim, in ways that you don't. Oh, my goodness. He was my friend. You know, I got a letter this week, Tammy. From the President. The President of the United States, Ronald Reagan himself, wrote me a personal letter thanking me for my support in his election! I'm an important man, Tammy Faye! And people don't treat important men the way that you treated me. I'm gonna clear my head, I'm gonna pray. I'm gonna think about what I want. Jim? Oh, God. How can I fix this? God? Where'd you go? Where are you? Why can't I feel you? Where are you? Oh... Where are you? Tammy? Tammy, it's all right. - Jim. - I'm here. I'm here. It's all right. Shh. It's all right. Um... Tammy, I, um... I prayed on it. And, um... What? You know, maybe I've been a better builder than I've been a husband. - Yeah. - Yes. But I know for certain that you are the only woman on Earth who understands me. Oh, honey. It makes me so happy that you're saying that. - Tammy. - Baby. I'm sorry. Oh... You really hurt me. I know, Jim. And I think you have to apologize. I'm sorry. Oh, I am so sorry, Jim. To the partners. - Mm? - On air. Today. Oh. I learned the best lesson in my whole life because of something terrible that I did that I cannot take back. I learned how much I love my husband, how much I care for my husband. And I learned a lesson of loneliness such as I never experienced in my whole life. All of a sudden, I realized that there was a lot more to marriage than just the sparkles. We're with you, Tammy! - PTL. - PTL. - How can I help you? - Ah. Bless you. Because of our satellite, from this moment on, the PTL Television Network plans to broadcast 24 hours a day till the second coming of Christ. Jesus keeps on takin' me higher and higher Higher and higher Higher and higher Jesus keeps on takin' me higher and higher Higher and higher Higher and higher Hi, everybody! God has a fixed law of giving. He gives me a shove Yeah If you're not giving, you cannot expect to have abundancy coming back to you. If you aren't giving, you're gonna have a harvest of misery! You're gonna have - a harvest of pain! - PTL. You're gonna have a harvest of sickness! If you can't go to Jerusalem, you could come to Heritage and you could go to the Upper Room. Exactly what you could see in Jerusalem. Except you don't have to get on a plane. You know, if everyone watching could double their pledge just for one month... If you haven't sent your pledge for $15 a month, do it now and I want to send you Susie Moppet puppets. God becomes your source when you give and you sow in his kingdom. It works. Higher, higher, higher Whoo Wow Whoo The PTL TV network is carrying out a master plan... opening centers all across the country to provide food, clothing, furniture, and job bank centers. Jesus keeps on leadin' me higher and higher Higher, higher Higher, higher Hi, everybody. Higher, higher Higher, higher Higher, higher Whoo Higher, higher, higher Whoo Jesus keeps on leadin' me higher and higher I've seen the rich and I've seen people with little who are more blessed than the millionaires that I've known who are worried sick 'cause the stock market doesn't know what it's doing! It's going up, it's going down! But people who have sown seed in the word of God, their stock is always up! Higher and higher That's why we chose this plot. And with the help of your investment, we could build a shopping complex around the hotel and then we're going to have a trolley. Mm. It's gonna wrap around the whole place, making stops at everywhere there at Heritage Island, the Heritage Grand, and then here at what is going to be our coliseum. We're gonna have a coliseum. - Coliseum. - Yes. You planning on sacrificing Christians? Oh, no. No. Oh, Jerry, no. We rise again in our coliseum. This is, uh, gonna be Christian rock concerts. Something for the kids. I really wish you wouldn't encourage these blasphemers. - Isn't it beautiful? - It really is. Mm-hmm. The trees, the oxygen is... Are you cold? Are you... Stupid question. Of course you're not cold. - Sorry. - Oh, I'm super. So, what do you think, Reverend? We would be tickled pink to have your support. - Jim? - Yes? The coalition that we delivered to Reagan, Vice President Bush... well, he's counting on us doing the same thing for him in '88. Um... You know that Pat called me and he told me that he's thinking about making a bid for President. Pat Robertson's a good man. But if he runs, he'll peel away vital Republican votes. We're in a fight here, Jim. This gay cancer is affecting our country, our families. Republicans can't win without us. You need to understand how powerful we are in this fight for our nation's soul. Mm. We should just stay out of it and keep politics out of the church. Too much on the line. Democrats are already trying to strip away our churches' tax exempt status. Oh, this time, we'll keep the evangelicals in the tent. When's lunch? Well, hello, everyone, it's just so nice to have you here with us. We have an experience today that really is touching to me. Right here on my right, I have a young man named Steve Pieters, and I'd like to introduce you to Steve. Steve is a patient of AIDS and he's so generously allowed us to talk to him today. He is presently taking chemotherapy and is unable to travel. So, we have a satellite hookup live from LA. - Hello, Steve! - Hi, Tammy. We're so glad to see you. I'm so happy I could be here. Okay, Steve. At what time in your life did you feel like you were different? Did you feel like maybe you weren't like some of the other guys? I realized I was gay when I was about 11 or 12. I talked with a pastor in the church where I grew up and, um, he was freaked out. Mm. He told me, "Don't tell anybody." Never tell anybody anything about it and it will go away, but it didn't go away. Okay, I have another question. So, the satellite is directly above us? Yes, it orbits us. That's how we're able to reach so many folks just simultaneously. Let me ask you, Jerry, what's your viewership over at Liberty Broadcasting? Oh, well, I'm proud to say that we reach three million viewers a day. My goodness. Praise God. That's just wonderful. And you? Well, we here at PTL, we reach 20 million viewers a day in 56 countries just because of that miracle up there in the sky. Oh, let's see who Tammy's talking to. And, Steve, because of this feeling, did you try to make friends with girls? And did you try to be around girls and everything so no one would think anything? Oh, sure, I dated girls. I tried to "program" myself to be straight and it never worked. So, what made you feel... And what's this, Jim? ...like there was no way for you to be straight? I don't know. - This is not... - It was from meeting other gay people who were happy with the way they were that made me realize I could be happy with the way I am. Now, I find this problematic. Yes. Well, you know Tammy, she... she connects in her own way and... Okay, Steve. What did you feel when you first heard the word AIDS? Was it just a word to you, Steve? Well, yes. Why would it hurt me? I was a good Christian pastor. I... I can't look at this. No. She must have programmed it last minute or... You need to get her under control. No, no. Let me help. Believe you me, I will be having words with her. - She's been acting very... - Jim. Yes? We have our differences. People forget sometimes a pastor needs a pastor. As Jesus says in Mark 5... Reach out. Yes. What happened when you told your mom and dad that you were feeling this way? - Well, my mother cried. - Uh-huh. And my father held my hand and told me that I was his son, no matter what. Ah, thank God. You know, thank God for a mom and dad who will stand with a young person. I think that's so important because no matter what happens to a young person in their lives, they're still your boy, they're still your girl no matter what happens in their life. And I think it's very important that we as mom and dads love through anything. And that's the way with Jesus, you know? Jesus loves us through anything. Jesus loves me just the way I am. Jesus loves the way that I love. And have you found it to be true that people wanna stay away and that they're afraid to be in the same room as you and breathe the same air that you breathe? Yes, Tammy. And how sad is that? That we as Christians who are supposed to love everyone are afraid so badly of an AIDS patient that we will not go up to them and put our arm around them and tell them that we care? This is an emotional interview for me. I just met Steve and it's like meeting him in person for the first time. I wanna put my arm around you. And I wanna put my arms around you, Tammy Faye. - PTL. - PTL. That's very good. Yes. Every time she calls, she screams, "Jim and his buddy had sex on me." - Okay. Shh. - "Now, I'm gonna kill myself. "Jim Bakker'll have my gosh darn blood on his hands." Now... Never heard so many curse words. Not even from my brother Pete. Right. - Did a caller upset you, dear? - Tammy... Yes. Oh, I'm so sorry. You know, when we do shows like this, really, we're challenging Christians to open their hearts. - And some don't take it that well. - Tammy, I will handle this. Oh, no, I have this, Richard. It wasn't about the AIDS man. It was about Jim. She's called before. We all call her "The Shrieker." She says Jim and his buddy had sex on her. Tammy, you're needed on stage four. Gosh, we've been having these pranks for a long time. And some people, they're just hurting so bad and we just need to love them. Anyway, Jim doesn't have that in him. Believe me. I know him better than anyone. Join the PTL Club, and Tammy wants to send you a copy of her book... about how to overcome fear. If you haven't sent in your pledge... $15, that is all, $15 a month, it'll change your life and, uh, we could all use a little bit of that. So, Tammy, I think you oughta sing a song for us. Oh, I'm back here looking at the boat, Jim. Isn't this a magnificent thing? Yes. Right here in our beach. Looks brand new, I bet. One of the local boat companies - loaned it to us, I bet. - I'm gonna take my shoes off. I'm gonna wade in the water. I don't think that boat's ever seen water. Oh, it's fake. That's... That's why. "That's why" what, Tam? That's why I can't hear Him. Oh. How can I hear Him when the sky is fake? You want to stand up, honey? We're trying to do a TV show here, baby. You wanna come give me some help? No? Well... I guess it's a good time as any to work on the tan. Well, if Tammy's not going to sing, I guess I am. Oh, we're blest We're blest, we're blest We just got her home. She's doing okay, she's fine. No, yeah. We'll be taking her to the Betty Ford Center in the morning. She just needs to rest. No shows for a while. What's happening with the other thing? Can I just say I love you so much? I love you. My friends are gonna be so excited when I tell them that I met you. Tammy? You had enough drugs in your system to kill a truck driver. I did? The doctor told us if you'd waited a day longer, you would have had brain damage. You could have died. You can't take all those pills, honey. They're addictive. I didn't know that. I'll stop. The doctors didn't tell me that. I'm not a drug addict. I'm only addicted to Diet Coke. You have to stay right here. God doesn't want you yet. I have always prayed to Him that He would allow you to save the souls that I wasn't able to. And He has. You do. So, you have to stay right here. Okay? Okay, Mom. Tammy. Oh. Hi, Jim. The Devil's coming for me, Tammy. Can we talk about Satan later? You know, I'm trying to feel like myself again. There was a woman... Fletcher set it up after you did what you did with Gary. I did it to prove something to myself, I think. I... I don't know. I hated it. I ended up just crying in the bathroom. I fell... a long way. I'm so sorry. Say something. I've been hurting so bad, Jim. For years. And there's never any release to the pain. There's never anything to make it stop hurting. And when I get up in the morning, I feel like I'm just gonna throw up... and throw up, and throw up. And I have to self-talk myself, "You can make it, Tammy. "You can make it. "Don't give up." Damn it, Jim! I'm so sick from my faith in you! Well, I'm sick of you, too. You try being married to Tammy Faye. All I've been doing is trying to keep our marriage together, keep the ministry together, working night and day while you're just buying minks and drinking soda pop and cheating on me with that ape! You used to take care of me, Tammy. You stopped taking care of me. I don't wanna take care of you, Jim. I don't wanna be your mother. A woman needs a man in a relationship! - I am a man! - You're a boy. I built all of this. I built you an empire. You built you an empire. No man could ever give you enough. You're a bottomless pit. And you keep on asking me for more with that whiny, grating Betty Boop voice! I thought you liked Betty Boop. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, Tammy. Me, too, Jim. Um... There's another thing. The woman... I gave her money to stay quiet, but she didn't. And, um... And the money came from PTL donors. Jim. And Charles Shepard has the story from The Observer. And he's gonna print it tomorrow. Oh, my God. - I just... I know... - Jim. Oh, my God. I destroyed everything. Our life's work, Jim. I know. Tammy. Tam, my sweetheart, if anyone falls, it's gonna be me. You can let me be the man that I was meant to be for you. You don't know anything. Oh, they're here. Who's that? It's all right. These are the men that are gonna help me fix this. Oh, no, Jim. - No, no. - Reverend. Thank you so much. - Thank you so much for coming. - Jim. Oh, it's love that carried me here today. - God bless you. - Tammy Faye. Jerry. Come in, please. Please come in. Welcome. Thank you. Thank you for coming, fellas. All right. Well, here we are. We think it's best that we create a distance between you and the ministry. It'll only be for a couple of weeks. Then, gradually, we'll bring you back on the network after all this unpleasantness settles down. Jerry, you're a Baptist. You know, you're not a charismatic. And our audience won't like that. - Right, Jim? - Audience? I thought they were parishioners. They are. They're our partners. We call them partners. Mm. 20 million souls a day touched by The Word. Thanks to PTL. Mm. You go back there right away, and... Well, bless your hearts. Look at the two of you right now, so very pitiful. They see you, and they'll change the channel. Jim, all those souls you won for Jesus... I'm here for you. - Thank you, Reverend. - Mm. Just make sure you take care of our partners. That is the only thing that matters now. You're watching PTL, The Inspirational Network. Tammy and I are so very glad that we've been granted the opportunity to talk with you today, and, um... Say hello. Hello, everybody. And... we want to say to you that we are so very, very sorry. And to thank the people who are standing with us all over, saying, "Jim, we do forgive you. "We forgive Jim and Tammy of all of their sins." And we're so thankful that God has forgiven us. We don't know what the future holds, but I believe, Tammy. 'Cause the God I know is still God. I believe that the sun will shine again. Oh, I do, too, Jim. Do you wanna sing it? Can you do it? - I sure will. - All right. All right, Tammy Faye is going to sing a song for us. Well, maybe you're hurting, and you need this song today, too. So I'll sing it for both of us, okay? The sun will shine again Now, if you are facing a mountain so high That just won't move away We've heard about your sinful behavior. If you tell us what we need to know about Jim Bakker, we can protect you. Oh-ho, listen, my brother We don't want them destitute. They're children of God. We want to make sure we don't leave them stranded in the desert. Write it down, what you make, what you need, every little thing. While you're in your time of healing, he wants you to be safe and provided for. I told him how fragile you are. He wants to help. He told me so himself. You wanna start us off, honey? - What should I write, Jim? - Start with everything. Start with what you need for clothes. What's your salary, Jim? One second. I'll try calling Jerry again. He hasn't returned any of my calls. The other side whose storm Is going to end Well, your midnight's almost over "Jim's salary for a lifetime "at 300,000 per year. "Tammy's salary for a lifetime at 100,000 a year. "Secretary for one year. Phone bill. "House on the lake. Security. Personal maid." I don't see the repentance there. I see the greed. I see the self-centeredness. I see the avarice that brought them down. Jim, I have sat across the table from men who have told me about your homosexual advances. And since then, I have learned of fiscal irregularities. It would be a disservice to God, Jim... It's all over. ...and to the church at large if I allowed you to come back. I've been had. How could you have trusted people like that? You understand that I can't allow you to stay here. Your home, and everything in it, belongs to the ministry. Your midnight's almost over. And thank God, the sun is going to shine again. Praise, praise in the name of the Lord. The charges being made against you right now are, in effect, that you stole PTL blind. While PTL was suffering through months after months of $2 million negative balances, you were paying yourself bonuses, - you were paying Tammy Faye bonuses. - No. I don't know if you ever have a positive balance in a ministry, Jim. I've never known anyone to have a positive one. We're... We're always playing catch-up. Jim Bakker went on trial on charges of fraud today. The prosecution called Bakker, "A man corrupted by love of money and luxury." The founder of the now-bankrupt PTL ministry swindled followers out of millions of dollars to support a lavish lifestyle. One couple showed up in Jim and Tammy Faye masks. ...couple million dollars in PTL cash for their personal use. How much money did you earn last year? Salary, bonuses, and dividends, and royalties... No idea? You're starting... I don't have the exact figure. - Not exactly. - I honestly, honest... I do not know how much I make. I never thought about it. - She don't. - I really don't. To raise desperately needed cash, PTL is auctioning off opulent personal items deposed Evangelists Jim and Tammy Bakker bought with church donations. They also brought new charges of moral failure. ...having sex with Reverend Jim Bakker. Jessica Hahn, Bakker personally directed the payment of PTL hush money. We grieve for the impact all of this has had upon the entire Christian community. As for the homosexual advances going back to 1956, - you're saying that's a lie. - Yes. Yes. Yes, that's... that's... that's true. What are you saying? That's... That's a lie. Yes. Yes. And, you know, people need to know that God loves homosexuals. Preachers have to be awfully pious. And when they fall from grace, they fall harder. People laugh. Tammy, we have a bit of goop on our face. You've taken her makeup off. I saw his wife. I heard the accusations, wife-swapping, homosexuality. Have you seen this woman? I'd swap her for a can of soup. National news, special report. Jim Bakker was found guilty on all 24 counts of wire and... - Guilty. - Guilty. He now faces up to a 120 years in prison and $5 million in fines. Ted, can I say something? Sure. I just wanna say, remember, God loves you. I wanna say that, too. God loves you. - He really does. Bye-bye. - He really, really does. All right. Thank you both very much for being with us. We're clear. It's all right, honey. Don't cry. No. I didn't do anything. Please. I have a song for you. On Christ The solid rock I stand All other ground is sinking sand All other ground is sinking sand God... I followed you ever since I was a little girl. I loved you. I served you. And I worked for you. God... where have you gone? It's not over till it's over. Hey. Sorry I'm late. Oh. - Hi. - Hi. - Nice to meet ya. I'm Tammy. - Nice to meet you. Stephen. All right. You need a water or anything? - Oh, no, I'm good. - Okay. My new headshot. Yeah, all right. Nice. All right. So... I hear you're here to pitch me something. Oh. So I should... I'll... Yeah. So, I have two ideas for you, Stephen. And then I'd like to hear what you see me doing. Okay. Okay. Um, the first one is about puppets. I mean, it's serious, but it's also funny. It's a talk show but with puppets. And it's for kids and also for adults. And it's a way for people to talk about their problems, but with puppets. Okay. Okay, I have something else for you, Stephen. - Oh, okay, another one. - It's for teenagers. You know, the biggest problem that they say is, "How can we get people to listen to us?" And I would really love to give them that chance and, you know, go where they go. I'd love to go to the piercing parlors with them, I'd love to go to the tattoo places with them, and... And you would call this show, what? - "Tammy's Terrific Teens." - Oh, yeah. I thought that would be, you know, a fun title. I was just curious. Well, what do you see me doing, Stephen? I mean, you're the expert. Well, have you reached out to any Christian networks or anything? Well, they won't have me. Okay. Well, what I've learned from doing these shows, and I think you've learned as well, is, you know, it is dangerous to wanna be seen just for the sake of it. You know? Well, I do love the camera, but... Why? Well, because it's a person. It's someone to talk to. It's... It's God's love through me. So what do you think, Stephen? You know, would you like to do a show? I don't know, Tammy. I just don't think it's a good fit for us right now. Okay? Well, well, I... I... - I really appreciate... - Thank you for coming in. - Thank you. - Thanks for coming through. We'll take care of your parking validation. - Thank you. - Okay. You have a good one. - Bye. - Bye. Oops. Oh, man. What'd she do to her face? I told you she lived here. What a freak. - Oh, man. - Hi. Oh, shit. She's comin' over here. - You guys just hangin' out? - Yeah. So, you can talk about me. That's all right. But, you know, you gotta shake my hand, and you gotta say hi first. - Hi. - Hi, nice to meet ya. I'm Tammy. What's your name? - Um, Max. - Hi. But, you know, we're not strangers. I live right there. We're neighbors. Oh! Let me show you guys what I just got. Who would like a picture? Jolene, I cannot believe that you have eaten almost an entire jar of peanut butter. Well, I'm sorry, Susanne. I happen to be eating for two. Don't beg. Okay, you're being so good. I say, have at it. You know, Susanne, since you're having so much trouble collecting money for your benefit, I might be able to help you out. You, how? God bless you. You've reached Tammy. Leave me a message. Hello, Mrs. Bakker. This is Linda Thomas from Oral Roberts School of Divinity. You probably don't remember but I volunteered at PTL. You were always so nice to me. Anyway, I'm calling to invite you to sing at this year's festival of Praise and Redemption. I think you'd be a wonderful addition to our program. We'll check back with you to find out if you're interested. Thanks very much. - Hi. - Hi. So, what's new? Oh. I don't know. I got an invitation from Oral Roberts to sing. - Wow. - Yeah. That's wonderful. - I'm not gonna do it though. - You should. No, I haven't been in church for years. Well, that's where you belong. No, I don't belong with them. They're gonna laugh. I'm not gonna go. It's my fault you feel that way. I'm sorry for that. All of it. I pray for you, Jim. And I pray that God will use you again. Yes. I appreciate you signing the divorce papers, Jim. I didn't want to, Tam. I know. But, you know, we've just been through too much together and, you know, there's been too many hurts that have happened over the years. And that poor girl, Jim. I know, I know. I know. I'm ashamed of that. I've been getting some real me and God time in here and everything looks very, very different when you're looking at it from the bottom up. - Well, yeah. - Yeah. And I've just been thinking, were we preaching that God doesn't love you if you're poor? Well, you know that I grew up poor. It's not what you have in stuff, it's the people that count. - Amen. - Amen. Tammy. Mom? "We therefore were buried with him "through baptism into death. "In order that, "just as Christ was raised from the dead "through the glory of the Father, "we too may walk in newness of life." Such a good service. Hello, Tom. Thanks for comin'. There you are. Aren't you gonna come in, have somethin' to eat? I don't belong in there with them. Yeah. One good thing about your mum kicking the bucket is I never have to go to church again. No, I shouldn't laugh at that. - Oh, I did something terrible. - Oh? Oh. You're forgiven. Ooh. Wow, she really was blind, wasn't she? Mm-hmm. I got somethin' for ya. You recognize this? I thought Falwell took everything. She hid this. She stole it. Well, she said she'd be damned if she was gonna hand over this precious thing her daughter worked so hard for to the fat Baptist. We're opening the house now, Ms. Bakker. People are taking their seats. Well, hello there, Tammy. Hi, there. I'm scared. Jesus, come in to my heart, and forgive me my sins. I know I cared about things that I shouldn't have. And I know I got lost... and I forgot who you are to me... but that's done now. Yeah, I won't go forward looking in the rearview mirror of my life. On stage in 10 minutes. Thank you. Here, this is for the piano player. Okay. Ladies and gentlemen... ...please welcome tonight's special guest, Tammy Faye. Aw. Thank you. Thank you so much. I am genuinely, I am so happy to be back where I once belonged. This morning when I was in need of some comfort, I turned to my favorite scripture, Psalms 91. "He that dwelleth in the secret place "of the most high "shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty." And this is my favorite part. "He shall cover thee with His feathers "and under His wings "shalt thou trust." Well, I haven't had a concert in almost a decade and I am a little nervous. But I'll do my best to deliver Him to you folks tonight. Okay? Mine eyes Have seen the glory Of the coming of the Lord He is trampling out the vintage Where the grapes of wrath are stored He hath loosed The fateful lightning Of His terrible, swift sword His truth is marching on Glory, glory, hallelujah Glory, glory, hallelujah Glory, glory, hallelujah His truth is marching on I have read His fiery gospel Writ in burnished rows of steel "As ye deal with my condemners "So with you my grace shall deal" Let the Hero, born of woman Crush the serpent with his heel Since God is marching on Come on, everybody! Feel his miracle! Glory, glory, hallelujah Glory, glory, hallelujah Glory, glory, hallelujah His truth is marching on Oh, how thankful I am for the amazing grace of God. Because without that beautiful grace, I wouldn't even be here today. That grace that reached down and said, "Tammy Faye, I love you. "And I love you just the way you are." You know God's grace is sufficient enough for you today, too. And He loves you just the way you are! Glory, glory, hallelujah Glory, glory, hallelujah Glory, glory, hallelujah His truth is marching on Our God is Marching On Thank you, Lord, for the United States of America. We thank you, Lord, that we live in this wonderful country. God bless America. Hallelujah. Oh, yeah. It's not over till it's over.
