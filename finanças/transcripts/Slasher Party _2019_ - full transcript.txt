So now I need a double double with the grilled onions and the little peppers I like, alright, vanilla milkshake, animal style. I can't do that no more man. - [Man] I don't see the problem. - Of course it's not a problem. And that's the problem, alright? I gotta stay focused man. I'm on the grind.

So, get the address. - Yes, Sky. - I hope Chuck will be there, you know, he always has the best supplies. - Yes, Sky. - Oh, and make sure the driver's outside.

I kinda would be. - Okay look, I have an image to portray. I can't just roll up in the shit mobile. Okay, like, if anyone sees me in this, that will completely fuck up my image. I sing about hella hoes and getting bitches and getting racks, like if I'm seen in this, my image is ruined. - Right, so, you're a sound cloud rapper which means there's like no image. Like, not at all. You're kind of no one. I can't even probably get you into this party. But we're gonna try. - Goddammit Brittany, you're suppose to be on my side. - Well, I'm here for you. - Look, just have my back, okay? I need you to get in this party. All it really takes is a couple of influencers is to just put me on their story and like, I can blow up. - Alright well, this better be worth it 'cause I'm getting up at 6am and doing Runnion. We have so much coming up, Cochela-- - So basic. - The Iron Man is in 4 months, I need to look good, this is important. - So basic. - Okay, let's go. What are you doing?

He committed suicide: asphyxiation. - Asphyxiation. - Whatever, like, he killed himself with a sex hole. It's like that old dude from Kill Bill. - Okay, it's probably just fake news. TMZ is always spreading fake shit like that saying people died when they're clearly alive. - Or, there's a secret group of people, oh my gosh yes, yes, secret group of people, and they're killing famous people and making it look like random suicides. This is crazy. - Yeah, okay. - What is this? - Time to go. - Damn, firey ass, little ass Latina.

I'll see you around, man. # Do the J Ria. # We said, veda veda, oh veda - Oh, God! Oh thank God, you're white. - Yeah. - Man, white dudes sell the best stuff! - How much you want? - I think just a couple eight balls. I'm just trying to get low key turn. - Wait, wait, I'm a weed dealer. I don't deal illegal narcotics. - Shut the fuck up, are you serious? You telling me the white boy is not selling the white girl? - No, I, do not. - So, you don't have any Xanies, Ecstasies, Percacets, PCP, crack, anything besides weed? - Yo, yo, hold on, hold on.

You know, actual famous people? - Fuck you, man. I am famous, for real! - Sorry, I didn't mean to offend you. - Can't believe I texted the weed dude instead of the coke dude, goddamn. You know, I was gonna put you on the vlog too. Bring you a little business, you know, show the Teddy Bear Nation that you knew me. But instead, take this. Boom, bitch! [man laughing] - So vlogging is a real thing, huh? - Yeah. - You know? All of you influencers are talentless wannabees. All of that content is so, it's so goddamn cringe. None of it's funny. And you definitely can't act. You've wasted enough of my time. Just go through whatever lame after party you're headed to with all of those lapid people. - Gross, I don't even vape. - Just, just be careful. You never know what's gonna happen. - White dudes are weird, man. [dog barking] - Babe, I feel like this is the house. [foreign language] Yes, this is the address that he sent us.

Let's like go in the party and see what's going on, and you're crazy right now, Jesus. Should I pin my hair up or leave it down. Does it look okay? [foreign language] Okay, I knew that was just a one time thing. [girl laughing] Come on let's go. - Did you tell the driver to wait for 45 minutes and come back in the morning if we didn't come out by then? - Yes, Sky, but why don't we just call or text someone when we're ready to leave? - Look at your phone. See those little bars? - No. - Exactly, there is no reception meaning no service. Come on, let's get inside. - Boo, did you hear that raging fucking died? [foreign language] That's insane. That's like the craziest thing. [metal music] I have to fuck this guy tonight. [foreign language] - I guess the party's in he sound proof room?

And at this point, even if your chick offered to sit on my penis, I wouldn't put you on the vlog. - Oh, not even with these? - Those are, high five. Titties, litties. Flow, shitty. Have a good night. - You know what? I tried really hard for you, but I like it. It was good, me, oh my gosh. You should make a vegan rap song. Viral. - Okay, Brittany, just because you're vegan doesn't mean everything needs to be about vegan shit. No one cares that you're vegan.

'Cause its doo-doo. I'm sorry ya'll, I thought there was gonna be people here. I showed up, the door was unlocked, there was snacks and alcohol set up but I looked around the crib and there wasn't no body here. - Oh I'm here! - You sure that's the right address? - Nah, I swear it is. Look, this is exactly what they sent me. - Hold up, so it's just us here? Big, empty house, random group of unlikable people come together, oh there's something here. There's something here, do you smell it? This is a movie. - Like a horror film, but a real one. [foreign language] - Where all of you die. - Nah, nah, nah, I said a movie. Not a documentary.

You know what? Let me put you in the vlog real quick. [man clears throat] Oh what, everyone keep quiet, here we have a basic hoe in her natural habitat. Let's sit back and see what she does next. Maybe she'll go for the alcohol, or maybe she'll pop one of her favorite penny pills, right? Or maybe she'll go suck all the dicks in the whole room. - You know you talk a lot of shit for somebody who has such a small dick. - Lame. - Truth. - It's pretty, alright? Ugh, enjoy the edibles. What is this? - Oh, I think it's some kind of weed cookie to kinda balance the alcohol? - Counter balance alcohol?

Oh you're so sweet. Are you eye fucking me. [foreign language] Anyways, does anyone know if Shark's coming? I don't have service to text him and I'm kinda coming down. - Who's Shark? - Wait, you don't know who he is?

How long have we been here? Has it been 45? - Uh, been here for about 30 minutes? Do you wanna leave soon? The driver won't be back for another 15. - Ugh, what can we do for 15? # Baby, you can't see it # But it's for real # I'll admit it # And even though that I feel it # # Question is are you feeling it too # # Ah, I have all the feelings # My heart had a hard time believing # # I had hella feelings # My heart had fun believing # No one can really predict the future # # Now I can see you and me with a future # [girl screams] - Is everything okay? - Hey, you okay? - Huh, what? - Oh good, he didn't O.D. or anything, he's fine. - Fuck, what day is it? - Are you fucked up? - No I'm not fucked up. You know I don't do that. [foreign language] - And, it doesn't mean I do drugs. Drugs are bad for you. I smoke weed. And that ain't a drug. - You got your high and passed out, didn't you? - Chill. - This time I know I heard someone scream. - We found Shark. - Wait, were you both about to go at it? Holy shit that's hot. - Shut up, you're find now. Move quicker, pass over the good shit. - Wait. - On what? Stop being such a goddamn coke block. - You woke me up from a threesome. - What threesome? - The one I had in my dream. Titties to the left of me. Titties to the right. Titties in front of my face. - There's gonna be a foot in your face if you don't hurry your ass up. - You're turning me on, Sky. I missed you. - Stop it, I don't know where those lips have been. But okay, fine, I missed you too. - Take your shit. - April, can you go find your ring for me? - Yes, Sky. [glass breaking] - Ope, I guess that's my cue.

It's very unlady-- - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, put the glass down. What happened? - Bro, I didn't do shit. These bitches be crazy. - What the fucker do again. - You're right. - Ted gave home girl some meat from the fridge. - What's wrong with that? - Yeah. - She's vegan. [Ted chuckles] - How long have you even been vegan? - That's not the point. - Geese, you guys are, all you vegans are so annoying. You think you're so much better than everyone else. Always telling us how to live our lives just because what, you care about animals and you eat kale and you drink water with little bits of fruit in it, and you kiss your puppies in the mouths and shit. You have a leather skirt on. This is all just a big food conspiracy. - But you didn't have to trick me. I trusted you. - Who told you to trust me? You don't even know me. Ya'll are so dramatic man. I wish we could just take all the vegans, put you in a huge meat grinder, make little sliders, put some Saracha on there, and just end the world of vegans, and make the world so much better. God, I need some cocaine, are you down? Alright. - Yo, fuck that guy, he's such a dick. Hey yo, this is your chance. I brought her for you, finesse. - Yeah, yeah-- - Hey man, you're just gonna make her smile and she's yours. Watch this and take notes. Hey girl, you know why vegans give good hud. - What? - 'Cause they like eating these nuts.

The people I follow, they don't even post. And I want to unfollow them, but is it fucked up to do that? - Are you fucking serious? - Yo, I had the same problem, man. But now, I only follow one person. Drives bitches crazy. - [April] Guys! - April, where are you? - [April] There's a dead girl. - Let me know how that goes. I'm good right here. - Yo, that's what a dead body really looks like? - Yo champ, you ain't gotta be here for this. - Nah, I'm good. I swear, I'm good. I just can't breathe. I'm good, I'm good though. - Dre, right? Why don't you call 911, see if you can get the ambulance over here, immediately. - Well wait, are you sure that's a good idea? If the cops show up, we could all probably get arrested for something. - Yeah, we three niggas and a dead white girl. I can't go to jail. There's niggas like him in jail. Look at him and look at me. - Just go. - Yo man, he right. This shit is fucked. Who you think did this shit? - I don't even know. - Bitch, get up! - About that, yeah, she's dead. - No she's not. She just wants attention. She's just an attention whore like the rest of you guys. What, fake ass blood you got. Look at this. Oh shit, no that's real, that... - Hey, let me go take the load off me and lay him down, man. - You okay? [fingers snap] - Huh, yeah. - You sure? - Yeah. - Let's get you up out of here, alright? - No, I'm fine. - Look, I know you're a strong girl. But you ain't gotta pretend to be tough, especially right now. - Are you hitting on me? - What, no, no. - Settle down, cutie. It was a joke. And you don't do it for me anyways. - I don't know what this is, but this is inappropriate. - Oh yeah? - Given a girl's situation, yeah. - Oh yeah, a girl is dead, we don't know who did it. And there's nothing we can do to bring her back. - Did you know her? - No. - Neither did I. Somebody must have really hated her. This doesn't bother you? - No. - Then what does? - Boring. Well, that and then fuck face Ted. He's such a piece of shit. Well, wait, where is Ted? - Good question. - Anybody seen Ted? - Hey, what's good my Teddy Bears, we out here right now just sitting, damn, stupid ass camera. What's up ya'll, we having a party? What's good, we having an orgy, what ya'll doing? - Where have you been? - You're asking me where I've been? Man, I've been around. I'm chilling, I'm in the universe. I'm existing right now. It's crazy because-- - You are coked out. - Bitch, I am not coked out. You're coked out, alright? - It's all over your face, dumb ass. - Okay, I'm coked out, and? We are having a party, right? - Wait, who does blow by themselves? - Him. - I wasn't by myself, stupid. I was chilling in a room with a whole bunch of people, and yo, what happened? - I'm gonna go check up on that kid that I asked to go call 911, alright, I'll be back. - Is she dead? Is this for real? - Oh, shut up. - Dre, any word? - There's a problem. There is no signal. - Have you gone outside? - That's the other thing. All the doors are locked. I was gonna try to go down the street to get service, I could not find a way out. - Oh my God. This is gonna be delicious. It's okay. I don't bite. I know you don't have service. You know it's okay for people to talk. - Okay, fine. You want some help with that? - No thanks, I'm good. This is like art. This is like making love. Every blunt and joint I roll, I roll it differently. Sometimes you gotta take your time and lick it slowly. Those are the special ones. And there's ones where you gotta be quick. Aggressive, spit on it. Slap it together. those are the wild ones. But in the end, it takes you where you need to go. - Okay, pause. Are we still talking about rolling? - Three, two, one, and we're sober. No we're not, she's dead, wow. This is crazy, one more time. One, two, three, sobriety. Let's vlog, okay. The view's about to be crazy, ready?. Dead girl in the Hill's, here we go, #notclickbait-- - No, you can't film this. - Stupid bitch, you swear like I ain't got cameras on cameras. This is my life, I do this. - Why are you even here? Fucking no one likes you. You probably had something to do with this. You and that idiot film prod are the only people who weren't with us when she died. - You know what Sky? I'm getting sick of all your little comments, man. You always got some dumb ass shit to say. - Oh, and what? You think I'm scared of you? Yeah, maybe you should be. Maybe you're gonna end up just like her. [hand slap] - Mike, we're friends, choke rougher. - Imma fuck you up. - Pussy. - And then I gave her this emoji. That's my favorite emoji. - I'm good, babe. - You sure? - I'm sure, I'm too high. I like, can't do it anymore. You think everyone's okay over there? - Yeah, probably some fucked up joke. You good? Are you scared? - Not really, I mean, maybe a little scared. - Nothing's gonna happen to you. - So that's a promise? - Nah, I don't promise anything. You never know what's gonna happen. I hate breaking promises. And I would hate to let you down. But, I'm gonna go outside. I have a dope little spot where I like to chill and smoke. - Am I boring you that much? - I like looking at the stars. - Come on, are you serious? There's no stars in L.A. - We're all fucking stars, baby. - Are you good? - Oh shit, I still have my sunglasses on. I winked. I doubt you could see it. Sorry about that. I'll be outside if you need anything. - I'll just be here by myself waiting for Ryder, I guess. You think I have a chance with that guy? - You're hot. He's really hot. Why not? - Babe, you still have sun glasses on. - Oh. - You know what? I'm gonna make a drink. Do you want anything? - Nah, I'm good. I'll be outside if you need anything. - Yo, what the fuck are you doing? Come on, man. Don't do this. I didn't kill that slut. - We don't know that. - This should keep you from doing anything stupid while we figure out what's going on. - Well, it was probably Angelo. That dude is weird. I had nothing to do with it. I didn't touch that girl. I want a trial by combat. - That's not a TV show, idiot. - What if it is? What if this is some weird experiment, you know? What if this is like a game to see who's gonna survive? - What if, what if, what if, what if? - She just hit me! Burns bitch is crazy. She's probably the one that did it! What, what are you doing? Yo, chill out, man. Look, seriously, earlier I was looking at my footage [sock muffled voice], bitch! God I hate you so fucking much. Fuck! [footsteps padding] [ice clashing] [drink pouring] - Just make him a drink. Like, just make him a drink. How is there no fucking service? This is insane, goddammit. Like, I literally can't, oh fuck, shit, goddammit. Are you fucking kidding me? This is a joke. This is literally a joke. Oh my God. Come on. [woman screaming] [garbage disposal swirling] [suspense music] # Die for the titty man # Die for the titty man # Die for the titty man # Titty man # Die for the titty man - Fuck, there's still no service. Yo Squeeze, is that you? [suspense music] Yo look man, I'm sorry about that shit I said earlier. I didn't mean it. Don't play with me though. Hey yo, Squeeze. [door clicks] Yo, yo, hello, I'm cool man, fuck this. Yo, I, I can't be here. Someone call 911. Get the cops over here now. - We can not call anybody. No body has service. And we can't get the ambulance here because there's a flood warning. - Why are all the doors locked? I don't want to do this anymore. I can't be here. - Just calm down. - Calm down, the fuck calm down. There's a dead body. - Yeah, we can see that. [foreign language] - What? Oh shit. - How the fuck did you get outside? - What, what the fuck is going on here? - Dude, Ted had to be telling the truth. He couldn't have killed that girl. - Did you see anything? - Nah, I was just chilling. I asked her if she wanted to have a smoke session outside. - Let's get out of here do do, you should probably be outside. - Doors are locked. It's clear that somebody doesn't want us to leave. - How do you know that? - Two words. Common sense. - Dammit. [lights shutting off] [foreign language] - Whoever you are, we got money. - Shit, ya'll got money? I ain't got shit. Okay, okay, now that Trump's president, I have no health insurance. I swear to God, if I get Chlamydia one more time, my dick will fall off. - Wait, who are you again? - Yeah, mother fucker. I thought you were the next chosen one, like Kendra Morrison. - Get the fuck out of here, man. I still live at my mom's. [girl chuckles] - Yo, why can't we just break these windows? - Nigga, in this bouji ass house? Them mother fuckers are probably bullet proof, earthquake resistant... - Whatever. I am not dying here with all ya'll. I'm finding my way out. - Smoke this. This will make you feel better. - Look. - No, no, we good, we good. Please do not be that guy right now saying we all have to stick together in order to survive. You are just as self-absorbed as every single person here. What, you think I don't see your posts? Helping the homeless, helping the elderly, what? You think you're so much better than us for that shit? Well, at least I know I'm a bitch. If you really were a good person, you wouldn't rub that shit in all our faces, and feel a need every time you do something good to post it all over social media. Look, I don't need ya'll help. I don't need none of ya'll in general. And I'm gonna figure this shit out on my own. - Listen, I get it. This house is filled with people that only care about themselves. I'm not perfect. And I'm not trying to be your friend. And I'm not trying to be anyone else's friend. I care about living. And if that means we gotta get along, then so be it. - I appreciate that. But, I'm out bitches. West Side till I fucking die. - Peace. [knife blade sheathing] - April, where's my gun. - I think it's in your other purse. - I told you to always, forget it. Anyone here have a gun? - Oh, fuck ya'll, just 'cause I'm black? I do have my strap, but it's in the car though. - Yo, I'm gonna go check up on Ted. Dre, stay here with the girls. See if you can find another way out. - Wait, you going solo? - I will go with you. Ted is one way to appliance. I gotta make sure he's still alive. - Don't die, sweetie. - Wink. - Nigga, did you just say wink? - Yeah. You can't see my wink through the glasses. - Cool. - Hello! Help! [man sighs] - Ord. - What are you doing? - I'm trying to stay high. - I need you to stay working. Ted. - Hey, he's still alive, good job. - Listen, I am going to untie you, okay? I need you to come with the rest of us and find a way out of here, alright? Don't be a dick to anyone. I'm serious. - Thank you. Okay, look, seriously, earlier, on my camera footage, okay, there's like a guy running around with like, a smilie face mask or something. - Sure he was. - I'm serious. What do you think? - It's L.A. Seems legit, maybe not. - Okay, coming from the guy running around in the robe. - It's called fuck you money. - What the hell does that mean? - That means I can do whatever the hell I want. I can go whenever, leave whenever, I can buy a whole fucking restaurant if I wanted to. I can wear this anywhere because do it to impress me. How is that roommate situation going? - Hey, hey, not cool. I live in Hollywood, okay? That shit is expensive. - You depend on collab money. I got the fuck you money. - Okay, well that's easy for you to say when you're a drug dealer and you don't have to pay taxes or do any real hard work. You think I do this shit for a living? I sell this shit for fun. - Yo come on ya'll. You guys can make up when we get out of here. But we gotta go, come on. - Look, I know it's a room here with an outdoor patio. If we can get the door unlocked, I can climb down and get help. - Where's Nina? - Look nigga, you go find a window. We're gonna go look for Nina. - Come on, get in, get in, get in. - No, no, I'm with you. - Now ain't the time for that shit. That shit is for anybody else, get in. I came out the closet once. I damn sure ain't gonna let it kill me now! Die mother fucker! Mother fucker, mother fucker! [door bell] Hey, go see who it is! I got this punk ass! [metal knife sheathing] - Leave her alone. April, run! [girl laughing] That's it? You blew a lobe of one stroke to my face? - Hey! [footsteps stomping] [knife metal sheathing] [suspense music] - Dude, this house is insane. How many rooms are there are? - The door's locked. - [Girl] Well, I heard Ryder's here. - Um, okay, but like, if Ryder's not there, who's sucking the dick tonight guys? - I did it last time, I'm not doing it again. - [Man] Charles. - Well, I don't even see a gym in there, so-- - But wait, do you guys hear that screaming. - Yo, we're up here! - Ah, it's 'cause there's a party in your pants, right, bro? - Man, if good guys can't get in there with these... - Come on, man, do something! - I am. [footsteps pattering] - Help, please help us! - That's the girls. They're on the other side. Come on, let's go. - Hey, so what man, fuck them. You guys tied me up and left me to die. Let's just get out while we still can. - Ted, I need you to come with us. Like, I fucking need you to come with us. I swear to God... - Okay, okay. - I will end you myself. - Okay, relax. Let's go, chill. - Okay no, but seriously, guys. What are we gonna do if we can't get in? - Man, fuck that party. Listen, two chicks and the shotgun coming with me. We going back to my place. You know, more champagne... - Help us! - I got dick sucker number two! - Stop, they're gone. - You just wanna give up? - No, just don't waste your breath on something you can't control. They can't help us. I'm not like you. - Oh what, you can't have feelings like us normal people? Is it because I'm not as smart or as talented as you? Because I'm not famous? - No. Unlike the rest of us, you're, you're a good person. - Come on, let's go find the others. - Oh my God, thank God ya'll okay. I found a way out of here, I just gotta go get help. You're not gonna die tonight, ya'll. - You're a soft ass bitch. - Main Shark is gonna help us track that mother fucker, alright, you go downstairs and get the rest of the girls. - Alright, fine. - Hey, hey bitch. Smiley face guy, yeah, what's up, you little bitch. What's up? I got this eight plan emoji. What you got for me? Say something. What, come on. - Hey, what are you doing? Let them go. - Hey man, this some bullshit. You gonna tie me up and leave me to die for this bitch? My career does not end tonight, okay? I got so many more videos to make and lots of views to get. - You sound pathetic. - Nah bro, I just adapt. Hey, hey killer man. I don't know who you are, but I'll trade you, okay? Her life for mine. You want her? [knife blade sheathing] - Go, go, go! [gun shot] [gun shot] [sad, slow music] - Why did you do that? You're not suppose to die. - Take care of Sky for me. Let them go. It's just me and you. No body else needs to die. - [Announcer] Systems offline. - Let's go, come on. There's nothing we can do. - Shark, I'll miss you. - I'll miss you too. Wait till they leave. [footsteps pattering] [girl laughing] - Why are you laughing? After all we just went through. - That wannabe director was right. All this could have been a movie. - You know the funny thing about fame? Fame makes people like you insane. - No, fame makes the insane shine. - I don't know what that means. Let's just go. - I'm going back. I'm not leaving him behind. But you can go. - Man they raised me to be a better person. I can't let you go by yourself. Let's go. [footsteps pattering] - Shark? - What are you doing here? - We couldn't leave without you. - Don't tell me you've been behind this the whole time? - [Sky] Huh? - Danny, machete? - You guys weren't suppose to make it back. I was just telling my company here what he had to do next. You see, celebrity is an exclusive club. There can't be too many of us. At some point, we have to thin out the herd. You know, the elite. Every few years, we have to take some of you out. That's where I come in. You see this face? They didn't hire me because I was one of Hollywood's pretty boys. - You were good, you look good brother. - I was a gang banger. I was a fighter. They needed someone to do their dirty work. They took me in. They put me in the movies. They gave me a lifestyle. But there's always a price to pay, isn't there majita. You think all those celebrity deaths you hear about and read about in the paper are accidents? You think all those over doses, suicides, and unsolved murders were random? [man laughing] No, mi amigos, we have to keep the circle small. You ever heard of the 27 club? It's been around forever. That's our work. - But why, why us two? Why let us live? - I'm not. One of you has to take out the other. It was going to be my comma dare here. But now that's gonna be up to you. Whoever survives becomes one of us because I'm out of here. - Wait, when somebody dies, it's usually just one or two people. This was a massacre. And besides, sorry baby. Shark's not even a celebrity. - Look, the elite needs to send a message, all those social media people, they think they're stars now. I just had to take out as many as possible. It'll be reported in the morning as some random, jealous, celebrity stalker murdering everyone and a manhunt will ensue. But no one will be found just like all the other case. - And if I take you out now? This will all end. - Do what you want esse. Me not important. I don't care. The elite will find you no matter what happens to me. Your boy here sacrificed himself for you two and you fucked it up by coming back. Now, you have to decide who's gonna live and who's gonna die. Me, I have to catch a plane. You keep the gun, esse. - Am I high? Or this really just fucking happened? - You don't actually believe him, do you? - What are you gonna do with the gun? - What you think? - You good? - Yeah, it went straight through. - My driver should be here now. We could probably drop you off at the hospital. - I can drive. - No, we stick together. # I don't see no sunshine # All I seen is moonlight today # # Wake up when the night falls # Yeah # I just let the stars guide my way # # I don't see no sunshine # All I see is moonlight today # Wake up when the night falls # I just let the stars guide my way # # We be hanging with the goblins # # Living dead-- - Just drive. - What did you do with the gun? - I got rid of it. Should I have killed you both? - Wait, what's wrong? Why are we not driving? - Paul. [scary music] - [Narrator] Yo, Labron is in LA now. Some of us don't think he belongs. You know what needs to be done. We were gonna have them do it, but that kamikaze's out here murdering all these wack rappers, so he's busy. You think you can? [scary music]
