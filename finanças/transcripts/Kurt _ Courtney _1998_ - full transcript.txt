[Nick Broomfield] At 8:40 a.m. on April 8th 1994, Kurt Cobain's body was found. He'd been killed by a shotgun wound to the head. The verdict was suicide. According to the police report, there was a cigar box to the right containing narcotics paraphernalia, syringes, burnt spoons and small pieces of black tar. [Electrician] I noticed something on the floor. I thought it was a mannequin. [TV Announcer] An electrician arrived at Kurt Cobain's luxurious home early in the morning to install security lighting. What he discovered in this apartment above the home's garage was horrible. [Electrician] I looked closer and I saw blood in the ear and a weapon laying on his chest. [TV Announcer] 27-year-old Kurt Cobain, an international music star and lead singer of the group Nirvana had taken his own life, shooting himself in the head. Beside him lay a suicide note. Sources close to the Police investigation say it was addressed to family, friends and fans. And describes how he was "Riding a wave of success" and dealing with a lot of the difficulties that go along with that. [Nick Broomfield] Kurt Cobain was icon and inspiration to millions. The news of his death was devastating. Traffic literally stopped in his hometown, Seattle. Thousands gathered to pay homage and to comfort one another. There have been many copycat suicides throughout the world. He died at the peak of his career, and many people have found it hard to accept that he could've killed himself. Various conspiracy theories have grown up. Kurt was like a folk hero, a god in his own right. He popularized punk rock and experienced incredible success. People loved him not only for his music. Kurt also remained true to his roots. This is what he said about his new-found wealth and money. [Kurt Cobain] Yeah, you can't buy happiness, I mean that made me happy for a little while, but, I mean, I was just, probably almost as happy with I don't know... I look back on going to second-hand stores and stuff like that and finding a little treasure like that. And that actually meant more to me because it was a stab in the dark, you know? You didn't know if you were going to be able to afford it. You don't know what you're really looking for. When you find it, it's more special to you. Rather than having $1,000 and going into a store like that and just buying the whole store. It's not as special. [Nick Broomfield] Kurt Cobain's story is the story of a brilliant artist, a tragic love story. It's also a story that some people have not wanted told and the various attempts to control the journalists, writers, film makers that have tried to tell it. This control I discovered made even the financing of this film very difficult. We traveled up to Seattle, Washington, where Kurt spent his last years, to find out more. He was seemingly happily married to Courtney Love, with a young daughter. In this street, Kurt's Aunt Mary lives who gave him his first guitar and with whom he did his first recordings. [Aunt Mary] The first recording that he did, it was on a great big old board. I had this great big Peavey seven-channel mixer. Eventually I ended up selling it to him. I sold him the old Peavey mixer that I had 'cause he wanted it for his band he was getting into. Gosh, I'm not even sure exactly when that was. [Nick Broomfield] What kind of music did he like then? Punk. [Nick Broomfield] Once he got over the Monkees? Yeah, Right. Oh, you want to hear some of that stuff? [Nick Broomfield] The Monkees work? Oh yeah. He used to sing a lot of Beatles stuff. [Nick Broomfield] That'd be great. I think I can get it on here [Young Kurt Cobain] Hey, we're the Monkees! Hey... [babbles] [Nick Broomfield] How old is he here? He's probably about two, something like that. [Young Kurt Cobain babbles on tape] "I'll do it by myself," he said. [Young Kurt Cobain on tape] He was a pretty loud little guy. He was the center of attention. [Young Kurt Cobain] One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Yeah! Go! Go! Here we go. [Young Kurt Cobain heavy metal singing] Early Nirvana. [Nick Broomfield] Mary also played Kurt's very first tracks that she had helped him record as a teenager. He was like 15 years old when he did this stuff, and he was, he was banging on a suitcase because he-- I asked him, I said-- I told him, "Kurt, you're welcome to use my computer drummer, "that I have down here." He said, "Oh yuck! I don't want to use a computer, "I want to keep my music pure." So he wouldn't let me... or he wouldn't take my offer. [Nick Broomfield] Did he record it on that machine? Yeah, he did. We can hear a little bit of it. Do you want? [Nick Broomfield] No, just play it. [Nick Broomfield] Courtney Love threatened legal action, so I removed the song. Instead this song is by Kurt's best friend Dylan and his band, Earth. We traveled up to Aberdeen where Kurt was born on 20th February 1967. A small red-neck logging town in upstate Washington, that has become run-down. Punk rock was an escape, it offered Kurt his way out. [Nick Broomfield] Kurt lived in this house with his parents and sister but his life changed enormously after the age of eight, when his parents divorced. [Nick Broomfield] Kurt's childhood was anything but glamorous. We went to see Kurt's old schoolmaster with whom he'd lived for awhile. Speak to me, who are you? What are you doing? Fill me in since I'm not sure. [Nick Broomfield] We're from the BBC. And we're doing probably the same film that everybody else does who comes to Aberdeen, a film about Kurt Cobain. He'd been kicked out of his own home. My two eldest sons brought him home one evening. With the request: "Dad, Kurt has been kicked out of his house "and needs a place to sleep for tonight. "Would it be okay if he spent the night on our couch?" And our response was, "Sure." We have taken in a number of kids who needed a place to stay. He spent the first night there, and then... that first morning he got up and asked what he could do to help around the house. What he could do to be of service and fit in. He asked if he could spend a second night. Then the second night stretched to a week, and the week stretched to a month. He kept his sleeping bag behind the couch. He was put into the rotation of family chores. He washed dishes when it was his turn, vacuumed when it was his turn. [Nick Broomfield] Did you have much contact with either of his parents? I don't believe that we ever made contact with the mother or the father, stepfather the whole time he was there. [Nick Broomfield] Really? So they didn't come around very much? I don't think we ever made contact with them once, no. -In the whole year? -Mmm-mmm. [Nick Broomfield] At other times Kurt would go and live under the bridge at the end of his street. The bridge immortalized by Kurt in his song Something in the Way. We were told by one of the locals that when MTV filmed here, they repainted it and removed all the syringes. [Nick Broomfield] This is Kurt at the family Christmas party in 1987. And there's his Aunt Mary. Kurt was then currently working on songs for the Bleach album. [Nick Broomfield] The girl with Kurt is Tracey Marander his one and only real love before he became famous. [Tracey Marander] This is the living room down here. [Nick Broomfield] We went round to visit Tracey who lived with Kurt for about three years. Kurt was also a talented artist. He gave Tracey these dolls which he baked with plaster. He also gave Tracey this self portrait. [Tracey Marander] A very skinny skeleton at that. [Nick Broomfield] Did it reflect him at all? [Tracey Marander] I think somewhat in the way he felt about his body size. [Nick Broomfield] Did he? Why? What did he sort of feel? [Tracey Marander] He just felt like he was too skinny. [Nick Broomfield] He thought he was too skinny? Yeah, he tried to gain weight and tried to work out a little bit but, uh, he just couldn't really gain any weight. He just sort of stayed, I think 120, is what he weighed. [Nick Broomfield] Really? Did he get teased about it? Um, he got teased about it in High School. You know, guys would think he was gay because he looked sort of feminine and small. -Is that why he wore so many layers of clothing? -I think so, yeah. There's no way you can wear that many layers of clothing and still be comfortable, really. It added extra padding. [Nick Broomfield] So he used to wear how many layers of clothing? Sometimes, he'd wear a pair or two of long johns and then wear a pair of jeans with ripped-up jeans over it. And then a couple of T-shirts and a sweatshirt and a flannel shirt and a jacket. -Really? -Yeah. So are there any other paintings somewhere else? Um, yes. In the bedroom. [Nick Broomfield] Do you mind if we go there? No, do you want to go this way. -[Nick Broomfield] Sure. -[Tracey Marander] Okay, More room. [Nick Broomfield] There's Elvis. Did he like Elvis? Um, you know, I'm not really sure if he liked Elvis or liked the whole idea of Elvis and Graceland. Um... This way. He did this painting right here. [Nick Broomfield] What's that? [Tracey Marander] That looks to me like a fetus or embryo. [Nick Broomfield] An embryo [Nick Broomfield] Was he sort of fascinated with fetuses? He didn't really seem to be, except in his artwork. Other than that, not really. [Nick Broomfield] But wasn't he somewhat fascinated by the whole birth process? To him, the whole thing was kind of gross in a way. I think he was sort of fascinated by things that were gross. He found the birth process gross or...? Well, all the blood and mucus and tissue. It didn't really appeal to him. He had made this collage painting, I mean I don't have it but... It was a collage of diseased vaginas and pieces of meat pasted all together. [Nick Broomfield] Really? Diseased vaginas? Yeah, he'd found that when he worked in a doctor's office as a janitor. So what was it like living with Kurt? It was fun. I liked it. He had a good sense of humor. We had problems with him not cleaning the house and that kind of stuff but he had a good sense of humor and liked to play jokes and he liked to cook a lot. [Nick Broomfield] Do you think you mothered him quite a lot? Probably yeah, without really meaning to but yes. Do you think he kind of looked for a mother in a way? Um... I think a little bit. I think he sort of missed that. When I first started going out with him, he was just beginning to get friendly with his mother again. For quite a few years, they were not on good terms. [Nick Broomfield] Is it true that you at one point said, "You've got to get a job" and he said he'd move into his car? Yeah, then I said "You don't have to live in your car, you can stay here." But that was good. He wrote a lot of songs. He was always playing. [Nick Broomfield] So, in a way, you were the patron of Nirvana. Sort of, yeah, I guess you could say. I mean, I don't want to say that for sure but yeah, in a way. Of Kurt, anyway. That helped him I think get successful a little faster than if he'd had to work at a real job and support himself. [Nick Broomfield] Is it true that he wrote that song About a Girl... He said "I can't spend every night with you for free". He never told me directly that song was about me. Michael Azerrad said that Kurt said that it was. It's a beautiful song actually. I love that song. [Nick Broomfield] I had hoped to play the song About a Girl over these stills that Tracey had taken of Kurt, but the music is tightly controlled. I was told by the record company that Courtney now owned the rights. And unless she approved of this film, it would be impossible to license the song. [Nick Broomfield] Here's Kurt standing outside the house he shared with Tracey in Olympia. It was said that he particularly enjoyed firing pellets from his BB gun across the street into the Washington State Lottery. -[Nick Broomfield] Hi. -[man] Hello. [Nick Broomfield] Hi, I'm sorry to bother you. I'm doing this film about Kurt Cobain. I heard that he used to fire his rifle at this building. I'm sorry, sir, but you're not allowed to come in. I'll have to call security. Are you authorized to be in the building with a camera? No, it's just a little question. [alarm beeps] -Good grief. -Shut the camera off, please. -We can go. -Do you wanna turn the camera off? -We'll go. -Just stay... -Let's go. We're gonna go now. -Stay here. [Nick Broomfield] But the fame really changed things. Kurt grumbled about yuppies in BMWs singing along to his songs. His privacy was invaded. This is Alice Wheeler, a friend of Kurt's. After he got famous, he was hard to hang out with. [Nick Broomfield] Why? Because you could never just go walk up to him and say, "Hey, dude, how's it going?" [Nick Broomfield] Why couldn't you? Because there were a lot of bodyguards and people in the way. He had handlers, that even when you did see him, and you started to hang out with him, as soon as he'd turned his back, the handlers would try to get rid of... Like, that happened to me. They tried to kick me out a couple of times, and then he'd turn around and say, "No, don't kick her out. "She's my friend, it's okay." And then as soon as he went to the bathroom, they'd kick me out. [Nick Broomfield] I asked why they isolated him. I think that fame is a process of isolation. And I think that none of us knew that's what it was. I think when you're a kid and you're growing up and you see rock stars you think, "Wouldn't it be great to be famous?" But the reality of being famous is kinda frightening, in a certain way. Especially if you're a kid that was used to being picked on by other people anyway. It's almost the same feeling. Kids chasing you in high school to beat you up because you're a geek or fans chasing you to get your autograph. [Nick Broomfield] Did he deal with that very badly? I think he was embarrassed by it. That's the impression I got from my direct experience. [Nick Broomfield] He was embarrassed by the fame? By the fame and by the trappings of fame. Once I was riding in a limo with him, and we were talking and we were having a really nice talk. He was very embarrassed that he was in a limo. He said, "Usually we take a van." He made a big point of telling me that, you know, that usually we take a van. I said, "It's fun for me. I've never ridden in a limo before. "I'm kind of excited." [Nick Broomfield] Alice Wheeler took these photos of Kurt and Courtney. By the time Kurt married Courtney Love in 1992, he'd become a serious heroin user. He said the heroin helped his stomach pains that often left him doubled up for days on end and which were caused by the stresses of his life. Courtney Love is quoted as saying they bonded pharmaceutically over drugs, like battery acid and Evian water. Courtney when she first met Kurt had been on the periphery of the music scene for years. She'd recently formed the band Hole, who achieved their first major success with the album Live Through This, released the week Kurt died. Kurt took the relationship very seriously. This is what he said when asked whether he'd changed his mind about having a child. Oh, yeah, absolutely. I really can't describe what changed our attitude so fast. I think, I really was a lot more negative and angry and everything else a few years ago. That had a lot to do with not having a mate. Not having a steady girlfriend, and stuff like that. That was one of the main things that was bothering me, that I wouldn't admit at the time. Now that I've found that, the world seems a lot better for some reason, you know? It really does change your attitude about things. Four years ago, I would have said the classic thing, "How dare someone bring a child into this life. "It's completely a terrible way to go "and the world's going to explode any day," and stuff like that. Once you fall in love, it's a bit different. [Nick Broomfield] I wanted to try and talk to Courtney, but had no idea at this stage how long it was gonna take before I would eventually meet her. The thing that most surprised me was the strength of feeling directed against her. Even Courtney's own father, Hank Harrison, who lives on this housing estate outside Sacramento has publicly come out and criticized Courtney for in some way possibly being involved in Kurt's death. I didn't expect to believe his allegations, but I was interested in them. He's written two books about Kurt, Kurt Cobain Beyond Nirvana and Who Killed Kurt? [rock music playing] [Nick Broomfield] That's him. Lean over in his direction. There he is. [Nick Broomfield] Hi. How do you do? [Hank Harrison] You're Nick? Hank Harrison, good to meet you. Pleased to meet you, too. We're on already, huh? Yeah. So, when did you last hear from Courtney? Her mother heard from her last week and she said she's getting married. You're kidding? But I don't' think she's really going to go through with it. I think she's trying to get into the... Are you coming in the house? Sure, who's she marrying? Edward Norton. This is the galley proof of the book, just to prove that it actually is finished. What does it say on the cover? Kurt Cobain Beyond Nirvana. You might get some gloss off the sun so maybe we should shadow it a little bit. What's your general feeling? About Kurt? I don't think he killed himself. I think that somebody killed him. I never said Courtney killed him, I don't know if that's the case or not. You think she might be involved in his death or even murder? I can't say one way or the other. I mean, I have no idea. I didn't say I know who did it. All I know is that the evidence is so strong towards the possibility that he was murdered. But in the thing l read in your other book, Who killed Kurt Cobain you say something about the fact he was going to leave... They were definitely going to get a divorce, that's correct. That's a well-established fact. She was concerned about the will? He was going to change his will, that is correct. The will is only one of the many, many points that are in that book and also in this book. One of the things I was interested in here was this book you wrote here. Who Killed Kurt Cobain. I was wondering if I could get you to read, there is poem in here somewhere. -Future Date. -Yeah, this one. I was wondering if you could read that out? The reason I did this in Courtney's handwriting is so people didn't think I was making this up. This is a poem that Courtney wrote, probably in Ireland in 1980, when she lived with me over there. She's told a number of people that she only lived with me for three or four days. The truth is, it was about four and a half months. During that time, she threw away a lot of poetry and I salvaged it out of the garbage or the fireplace. One of the things she wrote was Future Date. "I love you forever I'm going to be your wife "I'm gonna keep you around for the rest of my life "I finally got all these flies off of me "And now I can see a future date "A future date right over the horizon "Right on the tip of your tongue" Which is a reference to LSD, I think, but anyway. "I'll destroy anyone in my way I'll kill everyone Every lousy lay" "Cause I got my eye on a future date" It didn't make sense to me when I read it years ago, but after Kurt died I read it again and often wondered if she didn't have that extraordinary sense of commitment and determination, that nothing is gonna stand in her way under any circumstances, nobody is ever going to put her down. She felt she had to have that determination to make it as a success in the rock world or in the movie industry. Which I'm sure you do have to have that kind of commitment. But putting this in context with a number of other elements, you start to see an almost deranged thinking process underlying a lot of this obsession she has. It's almost a compulsion to succeed no matter what. The means justify the end. You're not exaggerating the violence and so on? No, not at all. If anything, I'm down-playing the violence. Courtney's had a reputation for being extraordinarily violent for a great many years. After I lost track of her, she was taken away from me when she was only five or six years old. So, I have no idea what went on. But she's been notoriously violent. She's written me a number of letters, where she said she stabbed a kid on the schoolground. She's been in juvenile hall and had a number of fights. It's all documented. She's punched out other rock stars, like Kate Hanna. She's had fights with Tad Doyle's girlfriend. She's had fights backstage with a number of men and women. Some of it is lightweight, but when she was pregnant with the baby in Ireland a friend of mine called me and said Courtney got in a punch out on Grafton Street in front of Bewley's restaurant. So, I know Courtney has a well-documented violent outburst pattern. [Nick Broomfield] For a father, Hank appeared unsympathetic to the life Courtney had led. Born Courtney Love Michelle Harrison on July 9th, 1965, Courtney, like Kurt, was from the age of five shunted between family members, friends and foster parents. She spent a brief spell in New Zealand, hippie communes in California, a re-parenting center in Montana. She eventually ended up in reform school, where she wrote: "I've been on my way here all my life." She then moved into the world of Rock and roll and got into the glamour of drugs. I contacted Courtney's publicist, her manager and lawyers to try and arrange an interview but without success. Her current new image is amazing, but she doesn't like talking about her past, as she revealed in a recent interview. [TV Interviewer] You've been a stripper, there is the drug use, the heroin... Where are you going with this? You can't do this, I'll walk off. I mean, I really will. I'm not going to do this on the Today Show. Well, you've been asked a lot about it before... Not on television. What's the difference with television? I'm just not gonna do this now. I want to talk about the movie, if you don't wanna talk about the movie it's fine. I do want to talk about the movie and one of the things in the movie, that's in every single article and it would be odd not to ask you about is that I've read you didn't want to do the heroin scenes. I'm not going to talk about it on the Today Show. It's not a demographic that I feel like talking about. Are you filming? [TV Interviewer] For a moment we thought the interview was over. In the past, Love has talked openly about her heroin use, but this is the new Courtney Love. The edgy rock queen now looks and acts more like a movie star. [rock music] [Nick Broomfield] We travelled to Portland, Oregon. I wanted to know more about the music scene Courtney had grown up in before meeting Kurt. And this is the music of one of her earlier main loves Rozz Rezabek, the Theater of Sheep. [instrumental rock music] Courtney had had high ambitions for Rozz. She used to dress him in other rock star's clothes. He was the local teen idol in Portland in the late 1980's. [indistinct lyrics] [Nick] Today Rozz lives in this street with his wife and child. [Nick Broomfield] So, um... So, how did you and Courtney originally meet? Uh, she came up and threw a drink in my face after we were playing a gig. She came up and just... Pshhh! A drink in my face and stated screeching, "Who do you think you are? David Bowie? "With all your mock rock star poses "and those atrocious green checkered pants! "if you ever want to make it, you better lose the green checkered pants "and cut out the Rod Stewart poses!" Blah blah. She started giving me this scathing review and I'm like, "Who are you?" But she did the whole thing in an English accent and she had this dyed black hair, everything dyed black. She was just back from England, where she was groupie-ing all the bands of that time. [Nick Broomfield] Rozz, now retired from the band, keeps his Rock and roll memories in the basement. You can play music so loud down here. This is all solid concrete. Every one of these is filled with concrete. This box here is just general from the time. This is the me and Courtney stuff. A lot of this is the Courtney stuff. She might want this back. "Property of Courtney." This is kind of odd. She's got "Courtney L" on this. That didn't really start till about, I'd say, '87 or so. But this is where she'd always steal my... These are my journals she'd always go through them when she'd break in. These are all just letters, crap. I figured some day it'd be worth something. I don't know why I kept it. I mean, these are my journals. Here we go: "Here's How Courtney Will Make It." "Gig locally, tons. Stop working at jobs. "Be financed. Get a deal. "Using the new connections and the old ones. "Movie comes out. Tour with Furs or REM." I've got this one list, it's so funny where she says, "Become friends with Michael Stipe." And what does she do? She goes out and does it. You've got to give her credit for that, I love Courtney. You've got to love Courtney. No, you don't. [Nick Broomfield] I wondered if there must have been some inextricable glue bonding them together like they were they great lovers? She's going to hate me for saying this, but no. Because with her, that's why I can say, she probably really should win an Academy Award. She would find out what your kink was or what your peccadillo was and she would expound on it. But it was always just like over-dramatic. It wasn't sincere. It wasn't felt. You can see with my wife and I. We fight, it goes back and forth but it's real. With Courtney it was always, "Rezabek, Rezabek, it's Babydoll." "I need a place to lay and sleep. I have champagne." She'd jump out of a cab and I'd be like... For the first two or three years I didn't even sleep with her for the first eight months. Maybe it was more than that, a year. I was like, "Go away. Go away. Go away." [Nick Broomfield] Rozz had found out that day that Courtney had belittled him in the press. No, Courtney, you're not that good in bed. None of us are. Sex is mainly up here. Mainly up here. And a kinder, gentler Charlie Manson is still fucking Charlie Manson. Don't fuck with me, Courtney. I don't care if you are Jesus and your lawyers are the 12 disciples. Don't fuck with me If I have to strap on a guitar and get up on stage and take you down myself, I will. Because don't fuck with me. I never crossed you and you've crossed me now. You didn't give me what was due me. You stole my career, you made me run away from it. You'll get yours, You'll get yours. You'll either be Frances Farmer or you'll be June Cleaver. But I don't care. Just stay away. I don't know. I'm getting worked up here. [Nick Broomfield] Rozz blamed Courtney's ambitions for him as the reason he gave up his career. He said she wanted him to be what Kurt later became. She at that time had thought it was a male-dominated world. She thought the only way she could achieve stardom was through a man. And she had all the ideas. She started dressing me in Julian Cope's clothes, Ian McCulloch's clothes. Everybody's clothes. Finally, I got her to agree to this thing of like, you'll lay off. Let me do my band and become famous on my own. She had an agenda for me and that was what was in most of those letters. She wanted to make me into a rock star to the point where I stopped wanting to be a rock star. I wanted to do anything to get away from it, because I'd have ended up like Kurt. I would have ended up fucking shoving a gun down my throat. You know? What else could you do? Hello? [Nick Broomfield] I went to see Amy, who claimed to have known Kurt and Courtney. [Amy] Hi. You guys weren't intending to come upstairs were you? Yeah. Oh no, no, no, my boyfriend's sleeping. So, how did you know Kurt and Courtney? They used to... I met them through my ex-husband. When we were living up in Seattle. We had the same drug connection. It was just down the street from us, so they used to come over and use our apartment, to fix. He's very nice, very well mannered or he was... Well-mannered, very nice, very courteous and she's a harpy. What do you think they drew from each other? He just was really quiet. I'm trying to think of the right adjective for his personality. Um... She's like a little ball of energy. A name-dropper, you know? Just gets off on talking so much. Kinda like sucking the spotlight from everybody else and he was happy to kind of sit there and not have anybody pay attention to him. I think he enjoyed that in her. It was something that he couldn't do. To be like a vampire, of sorts, the way she was with people. [Nick Broomfield] Have some coffee. Amy said she'd send me photos of her shooting up with Kurt and Courtney. Later that night, Amy took us to some clubs where Nirvana had played. Zeke, who were playing that night, were one of the many bands inspired by Nirvana's music. -[punk rock plays] -[indistinct lyrics] [crowd cheers] [Nick Broomfield] The bands all hang out in a funny little room up these stairs. [Amy] Nick, this is where Nirvana, when Bleach was still out, it was New Year's Eve, there were 50 people here and we came up here to do big lines of coke on this table, for New Year's Eve. [man] Many a party up here. But there were only 50 people. It was a New Years Eve show. Nobody even knew who Nirvana was. This is a cartoon that Kurt did when he was up here. He was so personable and so fucking cool. There's not many people that I can actually say, I was talking about that earlier to someone, Kurt was totally a listener. So many people wait for the chance to talk when you talk to them. He's one of the few people who I've ever met who actually listened to what you had to say. [rock music] [Nick Broomfield] Also playing were The Dwarves, one of the more violent bands who used to headline for Nirvana. [punk rock] [guitarist] Play the pussy, get fucked. That's what I always say. [Nick Broomfield] It was around this stage, the financing began to drop out of the film. My co-funders started to get pressure from Courtney's people to pull out. I'd been required to fax my intentions particularly with regard to the various conspiracy theories. [co-funder] I got the thing you faxed me last week. Oh, good. [co-funder] Which I've forwarded on to the appropriate parties. Hopefully we'll have a chance to talk about it tomorrow. -Okay. -Okay. So who were the appropriate parties? [co-funder] Just our internal attorneys and business affairs people. -Right. -Make them feel comfortable with what your angle on the documentary is going to be. Right. [co-funder] So hopefully we'll have a discussion about that tomorrow. -Okay -Okay. And was it roughly okay? [co-funder] Yeah, it was exactly what we needed to have down on paper. Was it actually Courtney herself who called MTV? [co-funder] No, no. I have no idea. I don't know if she called MTV, I know she has in the past and I hear you know, kind of raised holy hell... Holy hell. [co-funder] I'm not sure exactly who called. But they clearly are very sensitive to this issue. To the point where the head of MTV is calling. It clearly is a sensitive subject. But as of today, we're still alive. [Nick Broomfield] I didn't have an angle on the story. I was just trying to find my way through it. It was from this hotel in Los Angeles that the Courtney conspiracy theory started. On Easter Sunday, April the 3rd 1994, Courtney called a private detective. The previous day on Saturday, April the 2nd, Kurt had climbed over the wall of the Exodus rehab clinic in Los Angeles and flown back to Seattle. Five days later, on April the 8th, Kurt's body would be found at their Seattle residence having lain undiscovered for four days. The month previously Kurt had overdosed and possibly attempted suicide in Rome. May I help you, sir? -Sorry? -May I help you? We wanted to just try and get a room here. [Nick Broomfield] The private detective that Courtney called on April the 3rd was Tom Grant. Courtney found his name in the Yellow Pages. Tom Grant is an ex-LA County sheriff of eight years standing. We went with him to the cheaper Ramada Inn, around the corner. Tom Grant is convinced that Kurt was murdered. However, much of his evidence could not be substantiated. And under British libel laws, I was forced to remove them from this cut of the film. Tom Grant also asserts that Kurt and Courtney were having problems with their relationship when he died. And were talking about divorce. [Tom Grant] As soon as the body ended up dead. Courtney Love did everything she could, hires a private investigator... [Nick Broomfield] I wanted to ask you what do you think the overall scheme of the murder was, and how do you think you fitted into that scheme? First of all, I think this was in Courtney's mind, for a long time. I think even the word suicide entered Kurt's life a whole lot more after Courtney came into it. That word was bantered around. She was constantly saying things to him like, "What are you going to go do? Kill yourself? You gonna commit suicide?" I think Courtney used Kurt from the beginning. I think she married him for the sole purpose of furthering her career and obtaining some wealth. And I think that there was a plan that was formulated quite a while back about how this was going to end up someday. The day arose when Kurt finally made up his mind he was getting out of this marriage and was leaving her. [Nick Broomfield] He was going to divorce her? I don't think an exact date was ever set for this to happen, but when the time came and everything came to a head, it had to happen. [Nick Broomfield] Did he plan to leave the house? Yeah, he was going to leave Seattle. [Nick Broomfield] Tom Grant searched for Kurt at their Lake Washington house in Seattle on April the 7th at 2:45 a.m. and 9:45 p.m. but failed to find Kurt's body which was in the greenhouse above the garage. This is Dylan Carlson, Kurt's best friend, who helped Tom Grant search for Kurt. I asked if Dylan had said anything about why the marriage went wrong. We didn't talk about that a whole lot, other than the fact that they were always fighting, they didn't get along. Courtney had bought a Lexus, apparently, and Kurt was really angry about that. He didn't want to be seen in a big fancy car. He finally forced Courtney to take it back. It was embarrassing to him. They were constantly fighting over things like that. Which goes back to what Dylan was saying about them being total opposites. Courtney wanted the mansion. Kurt was embarrassed about the mansion. Courtney wanted a big fancy car. Kurt was embarrassed about the big fancy car. They were in constant turmoil over these things. They had different priorities in life. It was money issues, and that kind of thing... Sure. -...between them? -Mmm-hmm. And you basically think that the motive obviously in his possible murder was money too? Yeah, I think that's pretty obvious, and it's a motive that's as old as time. This was a great deal of money. Kurt was worth millions of dollars. If there's a divorce in the works, Courtney's going to get half of everything at best. If he ends up committing suicide, Courtney ends up with everything. She only knew him for a little over two years at the time. So here's a woman that came into this man's life and in less than a three-year period owned everything that he had accumulated through his own talents. [Nick Broomfield] Tom Grant worked for Courtney Love for seven months. He's convinced Kurt was murdered. He's written about these theories and has an extensive website on the Internet. He recorded many hours of phone calls, both with Courtney and her lawyers. He built his case on the following basis. There were no fingerprints on the gun or bullets, suggesting someone wiped them. The police work was shoddy and they had made up their minds Kurt killed himself. They even wrote that this stool was used by Kurt to block a door, that in fact had no access from the outside. He also argues the suicide note refers to Kurt wanting to leave Nirvana, not to kill himself. And he thinks, the last four lines were added by someone else. Hank, Courtney's dad, had various theories of his own. I asked him to explain his own murder theory, in light of the Rome suicide attempt. But he would try to kill himself... It was a fake suicide. He didn't really... He was just trying to get attention. Somebody used that to make it look like. [Nick Broomfield] Why was he trying to get attention? Because Courtney didn't love him anymore and Courtney was cheating on him, and he had a big problem with Courtney going out with Billy Corgan from Smashing Pumpkins and Evan Dando from Lemonheads, and he had a number of other people. [Nick Broomfield] But is all that proved? It's well-established that she was having an affair with Billy Corgan in London, when she was supposed to be meeting him for his birthday in Rome. [rock music] [Nick Broomfield] We wanted to find out more about Kurt's last days from Dylan Carlson who had bought the gun that killed Kurt. This is the pop promo for Dylan's band, Earth. [music by Earth] [Nick Broomfield] This is Crooked Axis for String Quartet from Dylan's new album. We eventually arranged to meet Dylan. We were told he was living with a dealer who had an Uzi and we should wait on the street. Dylan himself was immortalized in Kurt's song In Bloom. I found Dylan to be evasive and in a very defensive position. As Kurt's best friend, it was crazy for him to have bought the gun if he thought Kurt was suicidal. And yet at the same time he didn't want to appear to be supporting Tom Grant's murder theory. [Nick Broomfield] What about his relationship with Courtney? Obviously, it was going through some turbulence. Whether it was going to end or not, we don't know, I don't think we ever will. But I mean all marriages go through their ups and downs. [Nick Broomfield] Did he ever say anything to you about... I mean, he seemed to say it to plenty of other people. Said what? That he was going to finish the relationship. Divorce? He never flat out said anything like that or any implications about it to me. He didn't even make any hints as far as I know about any divorce or anything like that. [Nick Broomfield] If you were his best friend, and he didn't say anything about being depressed or being suicidal. He just wanted the gun for prowlers and that Rome was just an accident. Maybe you think also he could have been murdered? Why? I mean, it's like... [Nick Broomfield] If you were his best friend and he never said anything about anything being wrong and he'd seen you just before, maybe Tom Grant's right. He doesn't have to say anything about it being wrong. It's like... I mean... It's like... When you're friends with someone, there are subtler forms of information transfer than just flat out, you know... [Nick Broomfield] So what did he subtly communicate to you? I'm just saying, it's like... [Nick Broomfield] I'm just trying to get a sense of what he did communicate to you, what you understood. The thing is, the time he would have been communicating any sort of sense that he wanted to kill himself was when he came back from Exodus, when I didn't see him. [Nick Broomfield] But if you bought the gun before he went and you think he was now suicidal... I don't think he was necessarily planning to kill himself at that point necessarily. I mean, I don't know, though. -I mean... -It was just a coincidence? I mean, it's like... If he had been totally suicidal from the outset, he would have used the gun that day probably or something, you know what I mean? Why did he go down and try to go through treatment? [Nick Broomfield] Why do you think? Because there was all the fucking pressure on him to go through treatment. His wife's telling him he needs to go through treatment, his record company, his management. They're all like, "You have to get off drugs." You know? So he goes and tries to get off drugs and he can't or doesn't want to. It's basically he doesn't want to. There's no reason for him to get off drugs. It's not like he's poverty-stricken and robbing grocery stores to supply his habit. [Nick Broomfield] But how was Courtney telling him to be off drugs when she was on them anyway? I don't know, 'cause she was all gung-ho for him to quit. I mean, they were both constantly like... I mean... trying to hide it from one another. The most ridiculous example was, one time, Kurt called me up to get him some speed and then the other line rang and I answered the other line and it was Courtney asking me to get her dope. And both of them were like, "Don't let the other one know." [Tom Grant] Here we go. [Nick Broomfield] This is the actual recording of Dylan and Tom Grant searching for Kurt on April 7th in the middle of the night. [Tom Grant] If you could open the door for me. [Dylan Carlson] Kurt? [Tom Grant] Kurt? [Dylan Carlson] Kurt? [Tom Grant] Kurt? [Tom Grant] Hello? [Tom Grant] Hello? Kurt? [Tom Grant] I'm going to follow you through here because you know where everything is. [Dylan Carlson] Kurt! [Tom Grant] Does this go up another story? [Dylan Carlson] Yeah, there's an annex. [Nick Broomfield] Kurt's body was in the greenhouse above the garage. Tom Grant believes Dylan deliberately avoided showing him the greenhouse. I don't know what I think about the whole murder conspiracy. [Dylan Carlson] Put it this way, if I seriously thought Kurt had been murdered, the people, if I thought Courtney was involved, or if I thought... They would be dead now, flat out. I would kill them, if I thought that was the case. You know? But don't you think it's curious that if Courtney, as you said, loved Kurt so much, and she was so worried about him, she knew he had a gun and thought he was suicidal that she didn't come up to Seattle to look for him? [car alarm blares in distance] [Nick Broomfield] We were still trying to get in touch with Courtney Love. We returned to Los Angeles to see Al and Jack. Al and Jack call themselves "stalkarazzis". They work for the tabloids and live under the main LAX flight path. What do you see yourselves doing? Well, as far as you're concerned you want to find Courtney Love, and she is in a lock-out with her band at a rehearsal facility in Hollywood for the next several weeks preparing for Hole's upcoming tour. So, it would be quite easy for you to get this question into her. [Nick Broomfield] By stalking her? Well, we have a specific studio where she is at, where you will be able to find her. [Jack] We'll have to be like stalkarazzis, I like to call these people. We'll have to sit there, wait until she comes out one morning. They're there for six hours a day so we'll have to be out there probably with a smaller camera than the one you have here just in case something does happen, we whisk it away. We could always go covert too, you know. Don't forget... I could dress as an electrician in a jump suit and a work belt and mosey on in, under the guise of some other reason for being there. [Nick Broomfield] Al and Jack also wanted to put me in touch with this man, whom they claim was offered $50,000 to kill Kurt. I think what we should do is go and visit El Duce out in Riverside. [Jack] Yeah, we've got to find him out in Riverside because that's where he's at. Do you know where he is? [Jack] Yeah, we know his location. He's not afraid of Courtney, but he doesn't like to come into Los Angeles that much, he likes to have his little hang out. [Nick Broomfield] Why doesn't he like coming into to... Because a lot of times he has been hassled by the authorities. A lot of people know him out here. [Nick Broomfield] The police? [Jack] Yes. You've got to consider parents of young children who like the Mentors, absolutely hate this man. Because he is a debaucherous sort of fellow... [Nick Broomfield] "Debaucherous"? Debaucherous, very. He wears an executioner's mask. He, uh... Hasn't he had sex acts on stage? [Jack] Yeah. And there's no doubt, knowing him well, would know, hey, if I wanted to hire somebody to kill somebody El Duce would be the man. He'd be liable to do it like that. [Nick Broomfield] This is the promo for El Duce's band, the Mentors. ♪ Lady on the street, your ass looks so sweet ♪ ♪ You don't have to live outside anymore ♪ ♪ You body looks so fine I wanna make it mine ♪ ♪ You are my personal whore ♪ ♪ You are my sex slave ♪ ♪ You do whatever I crave ♪ ♪ Your ass I love to beat ♪ ♪ You're another piece of meat... ♪ [Nick Broomfield] The following day we drove out to Riverside with Divine Brown's pimp, a close personal friend of El Duce's, who said he could put us in touch. -Want me to give... Okay. -[dogs barking] Back, Vixen. Looks like him right there, actually. That's the one. There he is, El Duce. [Nick Broomfield] Where? There he is right there. So he's, uh... Hey, I got some... Courtney Love there... This is him, El Duce. This is, uh... -Argghh! Where's the booze? -Tell you, he's... [pimp] You're sure the dog won't get out and attack us? [Nick Broomfield] Is your dog an angry dog? He's just a perverted... Yep, a warped... Intoxicated, most of the time. [Nick Broomfield] But you did some deal with Courtney, right? Yeah. It was impossible unfortunately to substantiate any of El Duce's extreme allegations. And we were unable to reprint them here without being able to authenticate them. That's a fact, is it? People might think you're not the most reliable witness. Well, that's too bad. You may not be a reliable witness your own self. [chuckles] Now think about that one. Yeah. You know. When she offered me money... God dang! I wish I would have taken it, man. El Duce, I found out, was well-known in the LA music scene. A wild man with a strong following. He claims to have known Courtney over the years. And that she came to the Rock Shop and made him an offer. Unfortunately, it's this offer we were unable to substantiate. An offer that El Duce claims was very extreme. And there was no way it could be reproduced without hard evidence that it was true under the British libel laws as they stand today. Unfortunately, El Duce was just a bit too wild and brilliant for the English libel laws. [El Duce] "Make it look like a suicide." [Nick Broomfield] If you blew his brains out, like you said, it wouldn't look like a suicide. It would look like you blew his brains out. But I told Alan, my friend... [chuckles] I'll let the FBI catch him. That's just the way it's done. End of story. Hey, 50 grand does a lot of talking. Buy me a beer, I might do some more talking. Aaargh! [chuckles] [Nick Broomfield] And that seemed to be the end of the interview. I didn't know quite what to think. El Duce had passed a polygraph test even though his main witness had nodded off before its completion. This is Al and Jack rehearsing questions for Courtney. [Al] Courtney! [Jack] Watch it, muthafucker! [Jack] Just like that, be ready because she's gonna fucking try to grab that camera. The first thing she's going to see is that camera. The old Sony Handycam. We know this will do the job. [Nick Broomfield] This is Al shooting at Courtney's rehearsal studio where they're posing as record producers. [Al] I like that stage, that's killer, that's perfect. A good size. Okay. [Nick Broomfield] Here's Courtney's studio door. [man] Do you have a business card? [Al] I can hear her in there, I can hear her in there talking now. [Nick Broomfield] Here's Jack buying soda pop, trying to pluck up courage. And here's Al making his way over to join him. Unfortunately, the battery ran out. I found the closest we could get was to watch her at the Oscars. [reporter] Have you been embraced by the Hollywood community in the last year? If you mean treated really nicely and not having to dive into mosh pits? Oh, my God. So nice. So nice. And to that end, there are so many fans of Hole and of your musical work. What about that? Are you going to give it up for movies? In three days I have to start, and I'm excited. But it's another... See these? These symbolize that I'm not playing guitar. I'm taking meetings. When these come off, it's about the grunge. I was going to wear flannel tonight. Well, maybe next time, maybe when we see you next year. Courtney schmoozing with directors. We have more to schmooze with you as we continue. -Live stars are here. -I'm just jumping all over it. Here we are live from the Academy Awards. [Nick Broomfield] I wasn't convinced by the various conspiracy theories but I found the more I went into the details of them the closer I got to what actually went on. We went back to see Kurt's Aunt Mary. [Nick Broomfield] Did you feel that Kurt was quite unstable? Yes, I did. I do feel that Kurt was an unstable person before he ever got into the music business. When he was here recording in this very room when he was 17 years old. He and his friend, the drummer that he'd brought along took off for lunch or something. And I kind of sneaked in here and was looking at his lyrics. There was a song that was in amongst his lyrics that he never did record on that particular tape that I remember. It was called Seaside Suicide. And I remember that it left me with the impression that he had possibly tried suicide before. [Nick Broomfield] Really? [Aunt Mary] I can't remember the words, but I do remember that impression that it left with me. And I was like, "Whoa," you know? -Seaside Suicide? -Yeah. So... Anyway, I just don't believe in the conspiracy theory that he was murdered. I don't believe in it. His suicide note from what I understand was written to his imaginary childhood friend, named Bada. -Bada? -Bada. That was his little imaginary friend that he had and we used to do these recordings in my bedroom at home, my brother had a tape deck and he brought it over and it had this thing called "sound on sound" and it had this reverb unit in it. He would go "Bada", and it would go "Bada, Bada, Bada. You know? In reverb. [Young Kurt Cobain] Where's Bada? He did it. Where's Bada? He did it again. Where's Bada? He did it again. Where's Bada? He said it again. All this stuff on this earth isn't all that great. There's a lot of great things, I watched the Academy Awards last night, you know? It's so full of glamour and all that stuff, but it's so phony. I could have never seen Kurt sitting at something like that. It's just too phony. Maybe that was what really... what he was really feeling in his life too, is that it's so phony. It's not real, that's not truth. It's all put up there, it's a big... Like a... I can't even think of the word... A mirage. [Nick Broomfield] Towards the end, Kurt's life had become one of endlessly touring. He particularly resented having to sing Smells Like Teen Spirit at every performance. Mary, Kurt's Aunt, felt that the patterns of his childhood had been recreated in his adult life. As Kurt's relationship with Courtney floundered, all the worst horrors of his childhood resurfaced. The loneliness, the betrayal and the sense of abandonment. Tom Grant told me that two fans of Kurt, aged 12 and 14 had committed suicide in France that day. He sincerely believes that if he can prove Kurt was murdered, there will be fewer suicides. The case has bankrupted Tom Grant and he has had to give up his office. We arranged to meet him at the Westwood Golf Club. -Hi. How are you? -Pretty good. [Nick Broomfield] I told him that a lot of people disagreed with his theories. When you talk about a man that had 1.52 milligrams of heroin in his system when the body was found, and the fact that that has never happened in any other recorded case that we've been able to find after researching thousands of cases in several countries around the world... [Nick Broomfield] Isn't that an indication that he could be suicidal too? There's no proof somebody else did it. No, no, no. We're talking about evidence indicating it would have been impossible for him to pick up the shotgun. Now, for anybody to continually say, "Well, he had a high tolerance level. "It's possible he was suicidal." You're just denying and ignoring some real basic facts here. If it was possible, there would certainly be some other cases to be found where this has happened before. [Nick Broomfield] But he also had a gigantic habit, didn't he? Again, you can say that until you're blue in the face. Show me another case where it's ever happened. You'd have to believe that Kurt Cobain was the biggest heroin user that had ever existed. [Nick Broomfield] He was pretty big. He was just a typical heroin user. [Nick Broomfield] But it's possible that he managed still to operate the shotgun? Well, it's possible if you believe that it's possible to stand on a rooftop and flap your arms and fly. Show me a case where it's ever happened before and I'll believe it's possible. [Nick Broomfield] I'm not a specialist on the amount of heroin one can take. All I know is, in making the film, time and time again people who knew him very well said that he was suicidal. He was extremely depressed, his career was at a crossroads, his relationship with Courtney was at a crossroads. He was withdrawn and he felt he had nowhere to go. Let's just assume for a second Kurt Cobain was suicidal, okay? Strictly based on that premise alone, this man was suicidal, you tell me what difference that makes in light of the real evidence of this case. It doesn't matter. Just because a person's suicidal, doesn't give somebody the right to kill them. Just because a person may be suicidal, which I don't believe he was, but if he was, that doesn't mean the police don't have to do a thorough investigation once his body is found. [Nick Broomfield] Tom Grant's assertion that 1.52 milligrams of heroin per liter of blood would have incapacitated Kurt, were discounted by Dr Colin Brewer, formerly director at Westminster Hospital. He gave us this color slide of a patient balancing easily on one leg who had taken the equivalent of over twice the amount taken by Kurt. In any event, Dr Brewer said it would take 30 seconds to one minute for the heroin to circulate and take effect, leaving ample time to fire a gun. I no longer believed in the conspiracy theories, but Tom Grant, despite our medical evidence, remains convinced to this day. The other news was that El Duce had been killed by a train, near where he lived. We learnt his real name was Eldon Hoke. He was 35 years old. The official version was accidental death. But people had other ideas. We too had also become part of the conspiracy theory. I was beginning to doubt everything. We went back to see Amy. The photos of her with Kurt and Courtney which she'd been promising had never arrived. [door entry alert buzzes] [gasps] Sorry, I've come to the wrong apartment. Sorry. Hello? Hi, how you doing? Is Amy in there? Hey, how are you? You guys can't do things like that without letting me know. -Your hair's changed color. -Yeah, I colored it. Nice to see you. Where's your girlfriend? My girlfriend? You mean Alex? Yeah. Hi, honey. You've cut your hair. Are you guys all feeling better now? Yeah. What about you? [Nick Broomfield] I was at the stage where I wondered how much of anything anybody had been telling me was true. And I wanted to get the photos of Amy with Kurt and Courtney as a kind of proof that she really knew them. Did you manage to get those photos? I'm picking them up on Sunday from my parents. They're out of town. My little brother has come to visit from school. He's on his spring break. So I'm going over there for Easter Sunday. And do they know that they've actually got the photos? Yeah. My mom says the box says "Amy Photos" on them, so... They're mine. I just made her promise not to look in them. -Oh, really? -Yeah. I didn't want her to see what was in there. She might not be too happy. Unfortunately, the photos never arrived. But the person I had the biggest problem understanding was Hank, Courtney's father. I wondered why he hadn't tried to support and defend his daughter. Here we are again, cinema verite. [Nick Broomfield] How are you? No time to talk, just filming. -Fine, how are you? -Good. You've got a nice car this time. The BBC does its best. Well, I didn't get any of it, but that's okay. I asked him if it was true he'd got rottweilers to discipline Courtney as a child? No, pit bulls. This was way back in 1982. When I first got the pit bulls, it was primarily to put some peace into our house. I got the dogs, because I like that particular kind of dog, and then when Courtney came around she wouldn't play with the dogs anymore and she never came back after that. So it did the job that it was supposed to do in that it was designed so that Courtney would have to learn to deal with these kind of dogs and me because they say that people are like their dogs. -You're kind of a pit bull? -Yeah. But then maybe it's not surprising that you and Courtney don't have such a great relationship. I told her what the rules were. Tough love rules. She was a minor, she couldn't smoke in the house, she couldn't do heroin, she couldn't turn tricks, or bring her weird heroin buddies around anymore. Those were the rules I laid down, but she was welcome there any time, and she broke every one of those rules right away. That's when she was only 16, 17. So the reason she's alienated from me is because of the "tough love" we tried to use on her. She's hardly going to like you any more, with all the theories that she might somehow be involved in Kurt's death. I'm not in the business of getting Courtney to love me, or even like me. I'm in the business of trying to look out for my grand-daughter and myself. I mean, I don't know, it just seems strange that with one's own daughter, that you don't want to have... Well, I do, I mean I would like to have a relationship with Courtney... It seems you're going about it in just a strange way. It is, it's very strange, I admit that it's very strange. And most people don't understand it. -But what course have I got? -I don't understand it either. What course have I got? Ask yourself. What course is open to me? There is no other course. She has made it the escalated battle, I have not. But the two of you are kind of at war. Yeah, it's a great war and I hope the public watches it. But what's the point? She's your daughter. Well, but husbands and daughter... You saw The War of the Roses? You've seen husbands and wives fighting, you've seen daughters and fathers and sons and daughters... Families fight all the time. Why isn't our feud as interesting as the Hatfields and the McCoys? It's a family feud. It happens to be a public family feud. It's a fairly incredible state of play when someone's own father is saying that maybe his daughter is a murderer -or a murderess. -That's correct. Instead of saying, "Look, if you've got a problem, maybe I can help you." I have done that. That's all been done. Those are exhausted remedies that have been taken care of or exhausted long, long ago. Those are remedies that were exhausted long, long ago. And there's no chance in the world that those are going to be patched up. But is this the best way of telling her you love her? No, I'm not telling her I love her. That's not what I'm trying to say. What are you trying to say? I've got her number, hanging. I've got her figured out, she can't get away. I've got her nailed, that's what I'm trying to say. It's still tough love and I'm still the father. Period. Cop out to me, maybe we can work something out. But keep bad rapping me, I'll keep kicking your ass. I told her that from the beginning. I'll keep kicking your ass. Don't take me on. I'll kick your ass. I don't care how big a show it is. I don't care if you got $177 million. I'll kick your ass because of one Achilles heel that she has. I know how she thinks. I know how she works inside. I've got an inside track on her mind, her mindset. You can take all the LSD and do all the cosmetic surgery you want, you can't fool me. I know what her next thought's going to be. [Nick Broomfield] But the information that I regarded as being closest to the reality of the situation came to us completely by chance. Someone stuck this note on our windscreen. Twenty six. Park behind that red car if you will. [Nick Broomfield] We arranged to meet a woman called Chelsea late at night at this house. She lived in a room in the basement. Chelsea knew the nanny who had been with Kurt and Courtney in the last months. I asked about Kurt. He loved her unconditionally, but I think they had a very sick love, you know. I don't think it was a very productive love. It was based on, from what I hear, again... Based on drugs. And then once that perhaps got old Courtney was infatuated with the idea of Sid and Nancy. They often checked into hotels as Sid and Nancy. She told the nanny, who's a friend of mine, that they were going to be Bonnie and Clyde, Sid and Nancy. And I think once that wore thin, I think that the only thing that Kurt had left... Again, this is all conjecture, but I believe that Kurt's only interest at that point was Frances. I know of one incident, when Kurt had been gone for a long time, and um... He came back and the nanny was holding... She was outside with Eric Erlandson and some other people and... Kurt came back to the house, he'd been gone for a while, and... Frances had always been, "Daddy, Daddy, Daddy." Everything was daddy. And... She, upon his arrival, she didn't react that way. She turned and hung onto the nanny. This was probably a week before Kurt committed suicide. He said, "My own daughter doesn't even know me anymore." He looked really sad and went into the house. So... [Nick Broomfield] Her friend the nanny had never been interviewed before. She might come here. She's really scared. She's always been afraid to talk about this. [Nick Broomfield] How long was she the nanny? Uh... Four or five months. They go through nannies like people go through Kleenex. -Really? -Yeah. [Nick Broomfield] And she's really frightened? -What's she frightened of? -Courtney. [Nick Broomfield] She'd become very depressed and withdrawn following her time at the house just before Kurt died. I asked her what was so strange in those last weeks. There was just way too much "will" talk. A few different times, major "will" talk. Just talking about his will. [Nick Broomfield] What kind of points? Courtney talking about his will, and... I mean, what a thing to talk about. Was this just prior to his... Yeah, the month I was up there it was... I came home for a week, and then he died. I had quit for, like, a week. [Nick Broomfield] Why did you quit? Because I couldn't stand it up there. [Nick Broomfield] What did you think of Kurt himself? [Nick Broomfield] I heard he was a very caring father. Yeah. More caring than he was let to be. [Chelsea] What do you mean? She just totally controlled him. Every second that she could. [Nick Broomfield] What do you think he wanted? To get away. -From Courtney. -Really? I think he just didn't have a way, because she... [Nick Broomfield] Why do you think, if he loved Frances so much, why do you think he killed himself? Not sure that he killed himself. -[chuckles] -[Chelsea] There you go. [Nick Broomfield] Do you think someone else might have killed him? No, I don't know. I think if he wasn't murdered, he was driven to murdering himself. [co-funder, over phone] Well, unfortunately... [Nick Broomfield] As I suspected, under pressure from Courtney's people, our co-funders pulled out. It didn't pan out? [co-funder] Trying to keep this project moving, the subtle internal pressures... We were forced to bend to them. It's not easy for me to tell you that... My head of programming basically asked me to bow out of the project. What kind of...? [co-funder] As I mentioned, it was concerns from our colleagues at MTV. Because of their relationship with Courtney and Nirvana and everything else. So, I think we're gonna have to bow out. And I'm... I'm extremely... I extremely regret having to tell you this, but there's nothing I can do. I tried. [Nick Broomfield] It is this control, or attempts to control, that for me has dominated the whole story. And the control extended to the media. I might have lost a bit of funding, but a lot worse has happened to other journalists. Lynn Hirschberg, the respected and esteemed writer, received death threats and threats to cut her dog up after writing an article in Vanity Fair which mentioned Courtney's heroin use while pregnant. Things reached a crazed dimension at the 1995 Oscars ceremonies when Courtney tried to bludgeon Lynn Hirschberg with Quentin Tarantino's Oscar. I asked Lynn Hirschberg to be interviewed for this film but she said she had been terrified for her life, and wouldn't go there again. Alice Wheeler, the photographer, likewise felt intimidated by Courtney. She has, like I said before, kind of punched out a couple of my friends, and... After that book from England came out, in England but not in the States yet, she hired private detectives to interview at length Kurt's old friends. Which was very intimidating. [Nick Broomfield] But it's amazing they went to that trouble. And they had a list of about 70 people that they were looking to interview. So it was costing quite a bit of money. I just perceived the whole idea of the private detective calling all Kurt's old friends as a veiled threat not to talk to anyone. I don't know what will happen as a result of doing this interview with you. I mean, I'll let you know. [chuckles] [Nick Broomfield] Other journalists have received similar treatment. This is a phone call from Courtney to Victoria Clarke, who was writing a book on Nirvana. [Courtney Love] I will never fucking forgive you as a matter of fact, I'll haunt you two fucking cunts for the rest of your goddamn life. Going and interviewing Lynn Hirschberg is called rape. That's what that's fucking called. That's called rape, you fucking bitch. Only somebody on the Bush Family Values Administration would think that Lynn Hirschberg had any kind of fucking hot interview at all. Or you two goddamn idiots who don't even fucking know about punk rock. I don't even know what your fucking problem is or why you've got this wild hair up your ass but you're going to pay and pay and pay and pay out your ass. And that's a fact. Your fucking list of enemies is going to be longer than you can wrap your fucking finger around and you're gonna be so fucking humiliated this time next week, you're gonna wish you'd never been born. [Nick Broomfield] Courtney later physically attacked Victoria in a bar. I was in a club in Hollywood and Courtney appeared. This is before I'd finished writing the book. And she appeared and had a go at me basically, physically. [Nick Broomfield] How do you mean, had a go at you? She sort of grabbed me and attacked me with something. I think it was a glass or something. I ended up covered in beer and on the ground. She pulled me along the floor by my hair, and tried to get me outside. [Nick Broomfield] What, some distance? Quite a long way. It was quite a scary thing. [Nick Broomfield] But what I found most disturbing was that Kurt, sounding psychotic and crazed, joined in all of this, in an attempt to protect Courtney. [Kurt Cobain] This is Kurt Cobain. If anything comes out in this book that hurts my wife, I'll fucking hurt you. I don't care if this is a recorded threat. I'm at the end of my rope. You'll understand when you see me in person. I never been more fucking serious in my life. [message tone beeps] I suppose I could throw out a few thousand dollars to have you snuffed. But maybe I'll try it the legal way first. I was scared enough to leave the house I lived in and move 3,000 miles away. -[Nick Broomfield] Seriously? -Yeah. I left there and then. The minute I heard the messages, I left. I packed my bag and left. I called the police from LA, I didn't call them from Seattle. And, erm... [Nick Broomfield] At that time you were living in Seattle? Yeah, but I was living alone in Seattle at that time. -And you were really, really frightened? -Oh, absolutely. Terrified. Because I knew that they weren't joking, it was like serious. [Nick Broomfield] I'm traveling to the ACLU awards dinner. The American Council of Civil Liberties which protects first amendment rights such as freedom of speech and freedom of the press. And at which Courtney Love will be the special guest presenting the Torch of Freedom award. It's being held at the Century Plaza Hotel, in Century City, Los Angeles. It was a huge Hollywood event, everyone was there. Al and Jack were there too. Here's Al shaking hands with Larry Flynt. They had prepared a whole list of special questions for Courtney. Being somewhat taken aback by the whole occasion, I let Al go first. [Al] I caught your rehearsal at S.I.R. It sounded really good. How did you catch my rehearsal at S.I.R.? What were you doing there? You're not supposed to do that. Some other business. But what I want to know is I heard you do Let the Sun Shine In. Did I hear that? No, but did it have a lyric about sun? We're doing this whole California record. It's a song called Malibu that was probably what you heard. Do you like a lot of the new members in your band? I've had the same members for years. So, it's not a new band? I got some bad information. I'm sorry. I love my band, they're great. [Nick Broomfield] Al's nerve had obviously failed him too. -I was just so overwhelmed. -...El Duce or killing Kurt? This was your big chance. You didn't want me to do that, did you? I was overwhelmed by the moment. I had her there, and she got pissed about the Ed Norton thing. I thought, jeez... [Nick Broomfield] I thought you were going to ask her finally -about El Duce, or about... -What's that? Now I'm the guy on the spot. [Nick Broomfield] I thought you were going to ask her. I was overwhelmed by her beauty. [Nick Broomfield] Courtney, what does the ACLU mean to you? It's a lot like my parents, very liberal. It's very good that it's around. It protects everybody. It keeps the American ideal very much alive. It's really important. It's not very glamorous political organization, which I like about it. It's very liberal about everything, from anti death penalty... It favors stuff sometimes we don't all like. Courtney, why have you personally threatened journalists? Have I threatened them? Because that's my right. It's not against the law. It doesn't mean I'm going to take them to court, unless they lie. Don't lie. When I was really young, I didn't know that like... I was weird, I grew up with hippies, so I never knew like you know, that I was bugging anybody. So when I got crap for it, it freaked me out. I don't want to talk about it because I'm so happy. But what about the death threats? [Nick Broomfield] I wanted to pursue the question further, but the next thing I knew Courtney was on stage. There are so many people in this room tonight that have really taught me a lot about integrity. We live in a time when the Bill of Rights is being attacked a lot. And precious few people, especially from my generation, are standing up to say stop. All forms of media, the lowest and the highest have their absolute right to their First Amendment right as well. [Nick Broomfield] I couldn't actually quite believe what I was hearing, but I decided to do something I'd never done before. To ask a question in public that I considered well worth asking. Unfortunately Al started having a panic attack behind the camera. I don't want to appear to be a party poop, but in the interests of free speech, I wanted to ask a couple of questions. I think Hollywood always has a problem distinguishing reality from myth or image. And unless it is considered appropriate behavior to threaten or cajole or manipulate journalists, esteemed journalists who have written unflattering reviews, I find it a strange decision on the part of the ACLU to choose Courtney Love as a special guest here tonight. To Courtney Love, I would like to just ask what you feel... [man] Get off the fucking stage! [Nick Broomfield] That's the President of the ACLU you can hear shouting. You were not invited. You're not part of the program. Get the fuck out. [Nick Broomfield] He's a good friend of Courtney's. This clearly wasn't gonna be my entree into the world of after-dinner speakers. But I also wondered what kinds of things might be done to try and control this film in the future, and thought maybe I'd record as a kind of epilogue any such attempts. But the person who has used all this so positively was Mary, Kurt's Aunt. We went to meet her at Kurt's old primary school in Aberdeen. Is there anybody here who does not know who Kurt Cobain was? Okay, I just have to ask. [Nick Broomfield] Mary, using Kurt's life as an example, has devoted herself to teaching in schools about drugs and addiction. She introduces herself with a song dedicated to Kurt. [Aunt Mary] There's a message of life in this song. It's a lot like you and me when we're going through hard things in our lives. Losing Kurt was one of the hardest things I've ever been through in my life. I'm still going through it, I still cry. I still hurt from time to time. I miss him. And all of us go through painful things in our lives, it's just a part of life. Nobody is exempt from pain. [Nick Broomfield] I remembered this footage that Mary had given me of Kurt. [music playing]
