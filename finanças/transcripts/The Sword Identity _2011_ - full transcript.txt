Will you be going to the mountains to hunt? To be alone. Yi Ho. Yi Ho. Yi Ho. Yi Ho. Get him! If one defeats the four schools in Wuyi Lane, they can open their own school... A 200-year rule. I hope to have a fair chance. The form of your sword is unfair. You don't deserve a chance. This bow has the strength of 12 stones. There are many bows here Van possibly. You are right. Break your sword then you leave. He is no match for you. Hmm. What an evil sword. It's a great sword. Too bad xii? I'm going to see the Wuyi Lane fights. What's the big deal? All the young kung fu masters will be there. It's a rare sight. Why is there a fight? There's a Japanese pirate in the city. The winner gets the right to go after him. They've overrated him. That's not it! They're treating the Japanese pirate like the prize! They'll get him after they've had some fun! What if the Japanese pirate escapes? The reason for this fight may actually be to scare him away. Let me go take a look! - Ready to go? - Can you go? - He paid too much. - Be happy then. - We'll update you later. - Later. What's the point, if you're not looking?! I'm not here to watch you dance I'm testing your physical strength. What's the point in that?! If your people decide to invade my country, I'll be more prepared. My people are wandering nomads with no land. How would we invade your country? You have a point, but all wars are pointless. They're just running around How boring! - That's right... boring! - Lousy! They should be at each other's throats, fighting until death. - That's what I call a real fight! - That's right. You don't understand. Chinese martial arts isn't like street fighting. Victory is decided the split-second they clash head-on. The Lu school fighter is weak. We'll see. Very strong legs. General Qi trains his men well. How much more can you last? Now do you know the difference between civilian and military combat skills? This is a Japanese sword and it shouldn't be used I'll agree to release you, but destroy it. This sword is used for combating the Japanese. Regular swords.. Are no match when fighting against the Japanese. The general taught us to use Japanese swords to fight against them with their own weapon! There are many ways to fight. There is simply no need to copy your enemy. Take, for example, General Yu's yuanyang formation of three shield bearers with two spear holders. Existing weapons can surely defeat Japanese invaders. The patrol teams in the capital are all using yuanyang formation now. That... is the right way. This is no longer a Japanese sword! The general remodeled its length and the method of wielding it to defeat the Japanese sword! Whatever the changes were, it was only temporary. The invaders were defeated long ago. The two generals, Qi and Yu, have also passed on. Let the past die with them. The Qi army is gone. This army won't accept this sword. My only wish is to pass it on and to keep its memory alive. Don't get your hopes up. It's very difficult to get people to adapt to a new sword including the masters. Martial art skills are not necessarily the best weapons in a battle. You'll know that after? You stand here long enough. The one who escaped was General Qi's last bodyguard. He will never give up! Very well. We are at peace. There is nothing else to do for fun. Break! Why didn't anyone inform me about the Japanese in town? Chief, may I have a word? Come, give it a few knocks. I'm almost 50 and I'm still wearing paper armor. My last wish is to wear metal armor. An imperial suit. You're the anti-pirate chief in charge of the city. Surely you can get one if you so wish. Hmm? Making your own armor is an offense. It must be bestowed by the imperial court. It's peaceful times now, so I can't get armor. What the chief means is Japanese pirates have been long gone for years. It's rare to find one here. If caught, it'll be an accomplishment that merits a suit of metal armor. I need everyone's support. If there's any news, send me word. - All right? - Uh-huh. - All right. Let's go. - Uh-huh. - Madam Qiu! - Madam Qiu! Leave me alone. What did you tell the anti-pirate chief? I said we've got a real Japanese here. Why did you say that? I just went along with what people are saying. Didn't we agree to just scare him off? With this martial arts contest? It's also to boost the morale of our disciples. Yes, that's true, but it's impossible for people to accept a Japanese sword as their own. He isn't even Japanese. The fastest way to crush his dream is for him to be branded and captured as a Japanese. Stop the fights Search for him. - The Vermillion bird of the South. - The Black Warrior of the North. I really want to go! To what, see the fights? I can show you. You are bad people I shouldn't have come to China. Let me talk to you. Come. Two words, "Yi. Ho". What's that? Put the words together. "Yi Ho." Ho! HQ! - Ho! - Ho! It's an army drill command unknown to outsiders. Are you a military man? Continue. You still have strength I want to use my energy for other things! Pour the wine in the river. And what for? A test. Huh?! Sailan! Sailan! Your customer is the Japanese pirate! - He's Japanese! - Sailan! Good body strength. I'll teach you to fight one on one. Want to learn? Place one end of the rod out. Close your eyes. Wait for the enemy's weapons to make contact. When you hear the sound of contact, don't open your eyes. Use your full force to pull upwards. Madam, it's late. A woman should be home by now. Giving me orders? Brother Qiu may not be around but his reputation is still important. That's our home! - What do we do without our home? - We can't live without it. - That's our home! - Get lost! Move it! Go! Be nice. What should I do? Continue. What is it? Nothing. Yuanyang formation. - Never trust these martial arts types. - Yes. - He's failed to inform me again. - Yes. General, it's him! Aren't you supposed to be on that boat? That was a trick. How dare you trick me! The yuanyang formation can beat the sword. Even you succeeded. General Yu is a true master. Surrender? I'll bind you oh! Drop your weapons. They'll never listen to you. Drop it! Jump! Jump! Sir, there's a technical problem. The sword is close to my neck. If I jump too high it might cut my throat. You doubt my skills? No, I doubt my own skills. He's drowned! He's drowned! - He's drowned! - Behind you. All right. Men, move out. If you were three years younger, the martial arts fighters trying to defeat you would pay with broken arms and legs. If you were five years younger, no one could beat you. Stay in the mountains and spend your remaining years in peace. Brother, give me some water, please. Bro, you must have become an immortal. You look even younger than me. You should move to the mountains too. No stress... you'll age slower. So why are you leaving then? I don't have a choice. A Japanese has appeared. The young ones are no match for him. - Can't others do it? - Yes. I knew who you were when you left for the mountains many many years ago... The top master of Shuangye City Qiu Dongyue. - Oh, no no. - Just take it. You can't. - Where's your daughter? - What for? I want to give her some money too. You remember me because I was once pretty. When the two villages fought over a drain, my husband broke his leg fighting. I'll have to take on all the farm work come spring. My body will become tough and strong like an ox I'll no longer be pretty. Come here. Come here. This amount will last us years. If we live frugally, it'll see us through the rest of our lives. Right? I know there's another way of looking at this gift. When my husband's leg was broken, I went into the city. This is the price for a prostitute, right? You deserve this. I am a true martial artist. I just want to do some good. Master. Thank you! Thank you! Go ask them what the hell they're talking about. Have the girls gotten him hooked? They're talking about tata. Tata? What is tata? Destiny. Tata. Send more men. If there are more injuries, the name of the four schools will be ruined. Since last night, we've had 11 men injured already. My men have sealed off the two sides of the river. Send more. Send more men. Go. Brother Qiu. Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! Why don't you break in through the back window - and get him? - Stupid! So stupid! - Stupid! Stupid! - What do you know? We are from a reputable martial arts school and don't sneak up on our opponents. Martial arts principals in China. Have you heard of Generals Qi and Yu? Of course. 16 years ago, the Japanese invaded our southeastern shores and killed numbers of our soldiers with their swords. We were lucky to have Generals Qi and Yu, who came up with ways to get them out of our land. Generals Yu devised the yuanyang formation and General Qi used the Japanese sword to fight back. By observing by the way the Japanese wielded their swords? He realized that it evolved from rodwork. He focused on rod training for his soldiers and only gave them swords right before the battle. And they won all their battles. Since the Japanese army couldn't forget their sword origins and train with rods, they were unable to improve their skills. That's why General Qi's army surpassed them. General Qi's rodwork is called. Shadow and Sound. He is using Sound. That's true. Shadow and Sound is known only within the Qi army. The Emperor once sent the Imperial Guard Commander to learn it, but he was turned away. In the end he only learned the yuanyang formation from General Yu. He can fool others but not me I use a spear. The Shadow and Sound concept applies to spearwork too. What is this martial arts concept all about? If the man on the boat isn't Japanese and is someone from the Qi army we'll be a laughingstock. Life is unpredictable. Perhaps when the Japanese were defeated. They discovered the relationship between rodwork, and swordplay. Mmm. - Not impossible. - Not impossible. Whoever he may be, he's fought against us for one full day. He will be defeated. Brother Qiu, the reputation of the four schools depends on you. Is my beard a little too black? In my experience, the angle of the rod tells me where the man inside the boat is standing. Sound is based on reacting upon hearing the enemy's weapon against the rod without relying on one's sight. Before the enemy can react, the rod would've hit him. This is the beauty of Sound? But its flaw lies in that you only have one chance. You may strike first, and I can duck before being hit. Such a cheap trick I am the true martial artist I don't need to rely on such cheap tricks. In combat, it's all about reaction. Let's see who moves faster. Sir, since last night, we've swam two full laps around the city. Are you wearing us down to drown us? Huh? No, I'm doing a test. - Huh? - You're from the anti-pirate army I'm testing your water endurance I want to test the defense skill of this city. Well, your test is over I can't swim any more. No, you still have strength. Just kill us! Shall we swim another lap? Huh? Where's my partner? - Who? - The Japanese. Oh, at Master Qie's. Why didn't you go earlier? Security is usually more lax in the daytime. Oh. You're a military genius. You are too, since you understand. Come with me, men. Let's go. Go on home, Brother Qiu. Tell me where it is that you want to go I'll take you. Not... home. To my home then. Not inside I'm feeling better. The air is... better here. You shouldn't have returned. You know that I don't want you here. I know why you left for the mountains. You took the daughter of the Shi family in Boadi City as your wife. You never thought that she would bring her bodyguard along with her, did you? Since she was from a military family you really didn't think much of it until the day you found them together, and then you finally saw that they were actually lovers. I would have killed them, but instead you left for the mountains, and left your entire fortune for the two adulterers. Tell me why. After you left, I took over as the leader of the four schools. You know, I could have killed them and taken your fortune, but I decided not to do it I treated them well and let them live on happily. Do you know why? So that you would never return. Your words are killing me. I cannot compete with you. I'll leave, far away, when I recover. You're still my brother. Take care. Fear not. I just need a favor. Here are.. Three pieces of gold. Please give these to a woman named Gai'e. She lives in Yinma Village. I thought I would die on that boat. I had one regret... That I did not give her? The last of my coins. It's a small amount, but it's hers. Mmm. I will go. I never understood why you tolerated your wife's affair. Because... I'm too old. This is good. You can stay here. You're going to kill me? Don't kill me. Please don't. Everyone come here. Can we talk about this first, please? I would like to dry my armor in the sun first. It's made of paper paste. After being in the water for so long it'll lose its shape. I'm almost 50 clothed in paper like a kid. Not good enough for metal. Paper armor is better than metal armor. Once the paper paste hardens, it's resistant to water, it can withstand powerful arrows. It's lighter too. You're the expert. So what? I'd prefer metal armor. Master, we all know that it's been many years since you have touched a weapon. Tell us, did anything happen? I am the best martial arts fighter in Shuangye. It is time. Time to end this saga. Do not follow me. Commander. Ow! Careful... my foot. Ah. Forget about it. What's the next step? The masters are all by the river. No one's at the mansion. We'll start a fire at the mansion, so they'll all come back and put it out. We'll have a better chance against them if they're tired. I stood on my feet for so long and I realized one thing... The combat skills of the military are different from the martial world. Let's just give up. The Qi army is gone. It was your idea to pass on the secret skills to keep the memory alive! Not anymore! The waterway is our exit. What are you doing?! Your dream is now my dream. Use this as a crutch. What's going on? The three girls from the boat can't go home, the poor things. I take it that they've been fed, right? What are they doing? They are trying to show their gratitude to us. I see you've brought your weapon. Are you going in? - Do you have any wine? - We dance better with wine. - Give us some wine. - Give us some wine, please. Give us wine. Serve the wine. You're out of luck I planned to kill you in your sleep. It's hard to be kind. Do it now. Being forgiven is harder than being punished. You should have killed us back then. Perhaps I should have done so. Just kill me. You wanna die? I won't kill you. Let's exchange some secrets. General Qi is a hero that I admire. It's good to pass on his skills. Do what you need to do I didn't see anything. Hey, you didn't tell me your secret. I never promised I would. Starting a fire is not very smart. Don't you have a better idea? Yes, but I'm alone. Use another method. I'll help. You realize that you could die. I can hardly wait. It's an hour to sunset. With these two lanterns hung here, the shadows from outside will be reflected in here. What? When the top of the shadows touch the earring, that's when you strike. It'll be accurate. Just like that? The others are highly skilled. This rodwork is a technique for beginners to beat masters. Thanks for helping Take care. What do you call this technique? Shadow. What is your name? I'll tell you next time. Will we meet again? I'll meet you once for everyone you defeat. - Guys... - Why don't you dance? - Oh, come on. - Dance for us. - Dance for us. - Come on, just a little. - Dance for us. Come on. - Dance. Oh, come on. - Dance for us. Come on! - Dance! Dance! Dance! Oh! Get these dancers out of here. - This is getting ridiculous. - Go on. - Go on now. Move move move move. - Go on, move. - Go on, go on, go on. - Move move move. - Brother Qie, don't get mad. - Don't get mad. Boil some oil. Whatever for? To Prepare my spear I'm using it on the Japanese. Go in. Come on, let's go. You go on ahead. Our bad thoughts make us do this. Blame it on our custom Chinese girls don't dance like you girls do. All right, we will do what you guys ask of us, but there's three of us and five of you guys. It's not civilized I understand. There are two short straws in my hand here. The ones who get them leave... No complaints. Don't just settle it like that. Can't you act like real men and kill each other for us? Brother! Bro! How could we forget to keep count? I'm the only one left It's one to three. Surely it's civilized to you now. Sure it is! We can climb out from here. Those five men again! It's their ghosts! Brother Qie, the oil's been boiling for hours. Add another two buckets. Master Qie! Master Qie! Hyah! Move aside. Come here. Let me test your strength. I don't mean to bother you but I have urgent business. - Speak. - Is Qiu Dongyue in town? - Yes. - I heard he was injured by the Japanese and is now in your home. - Yes. - And what about Ms. Shi? Well, she's been gone since she heard the news I think she must have snuck into your residence, Master. You could've done the same I thought about doing that too, but I'd rather have your permission. Thank you I've cooked a pot of oil. Come take a look. At 22 years old I used a spear that weighed 40 lbs, which I used till I was 53. The man I admire most is Qiu Dongyue. Since he left for the mountains, no one worthy has been around for me to use such a heavy weapon against. This spear is made of bamboo? When boiling oil is poured onto the bamboo, it doesn't break easily against metal I didn't know. You're the bodyguard from Madam Qiu's maiden home, and it's a habit for you to call her "Ms. Shi." But Brother Qiu is a man I admire, so do address her as Madam Qiu. At least in front of me. Yes sir, you are right. A Japanese! He's here! Someone help me! You. You are back. Your strength is very scary. Come on! Please, no more tests! You have a point. You've helped me a lot I need to explain things to you 16 years ago, Japanese pirates invaded our coast. General Qi and General Yu... It's all right I already have the answer I need. What's that? You're a tata. Huh? It's a custom of ours that if a woman has risked her life for a man, this man is now and forever her tata. - What is a tata? - Destiny. What's with the mess? The Japanese got in and injured a few men Gan Gang. My head really aches. Where is Ms. Shi? Why would she see me? I will leave once I recover and never return. You'll stay in the city with Ms. Shi perhaps forever. Master Qie is a very powerful man in this city. If you can help him get rid of the Japanese invader, you'll have his backing in the future. Thank you. You're the top master and you were defeated. How can I defeat him? I'm very old now, my senses are slow but I still have technique. I can help you. - Closer. - Who's that? - Go away. - Closer. - Get lost! I said get lost! - It's me. - Master! - Master Qiu? Closer. This man is very skilled. He's adjusting his breathing. Once his breath is at its most calm, his reflexes will be the fastest. Yi. The trick lies in those two lanterns. The attacks aren't based on your movement, but on your shadow. That's why he's faster. This is Shadow. Yes, I know what to do now. What do you know? I'll destroy the lanterns and then barge in. And battle it out for a few rounds? Masters don't fight that way. We strike once. At your age, you should be fighting like a master. Move forward one inch at a time, very very slowly so that he doesn't see any change in the shadow. Walk towards the door. The moment you see your shadow on the doorway swing your ax upwards. What next? He's dead. But how is that possible? I don't even know if he's on the left or the right side of the door. Just swing your ax upwards. If he's on the left the ax will swing left. If on the right, it'll swing right. But that's impossible. It's hard to comprehend a master. Don't think. Just believe in me. Go on. Now. Qiu Dongyue, I tricked you into leaving. You were so focused on martial arts that you never suspected anything. But an impure heart destroys one's art. Before today, I would've never imagined that I'd lose my fighting spirit. Among the traditional weapons, spears are ranked first and rods are second. The rod is designed to defeat the spear. I missed killing him by half an inch. My spear feels different. You were right, Brother Qiu. Move! Master, a Japanese broke in. Please go see. Let it be. Yi Ho. Yi Ho! I'm the Japanese pirate. Come and get me! I'm Japanese! I am Japanese! I'm Japanese! I'm Japanese! I am Japanese! I'm Japanese! I am Japanese! - I'm Japanese! - Yi Ho. Yi Ho. Yi Ho. - Yi Ho. Yi Ho. Yi Ho. - Yi Ho! My name is General Liu Kai from the anti-pirate army. Ladies! My lord. My lord. Congratulations, you've got him. You're so brave! You're my tata. What's a tata? - Destiny. - He's my tata. - No, he's mine. - He's my tata. - He's my tata. - He's mine! - Mine. He's my tata. - Mine! - No. He's mine! - My tata! - My tata. - He's mine. We know that you're from the Qi army. That's why we didn't use arrows against you. Now that things have spiraled out of control, if you continue to resist, the 600 arrows from our reserves are here and ready to be used. If you walk out the door, we'll give you a chance to compete at Wuyi Lane. If you defeat all four schools, you'll be able to set up your own school. We've fought already. We've fought. We've fought too. Your skills are poor and I am injured. We should stop and let the real masters continue. Stepping aside is a virtue. Hmm. So your sword can be drawn this way too. Japanese never do it this way. General Qi increased the sword's length. Japanese swords are sharp on all sides. Ours is sharp only at the tip. The other edges can be used to block attacks. You can hold it here, use it like a shorter sword. General Qi is in a league of his own. It's a pity that I didn't get to meet him even though we live in the same age. General Qi defeated many enemies with this sword. I will use it to defeat you. Watch out. Thank you. Don't look at my weapon. Watch my feet. I lost. This sword lost. Commander! Hold on, young man. You lost on the basis of skills, not sword. You all saw the sword is unique and it would be suitable for a new school. - That's true. - I saw that. Yes. You brought two swords. This one will stay here, displayed in the weapons rack of the new school as proof of this fight. Take this sword. Be sure to pass it on. Will he be back? Tata! Tata. Tata. Tata! Tata! Tata! Tata! Tata. Tata. Tata! Tata. Tata! Tata. Keep walking. Don't look at them. Tata! Tata, everyone knows that you've always hated paper armor and wished for a suit of metal armor. The Japanese was a fake and you didn't get what you wished for. My pitiful tata! Let us give you what your heart desires! The general? Hurry... another challenger at Wuyi Lane. Tata. Tata. Never trust those martial arts masters. - Tata. Tata. - They didn't inform me again! Tata. Tata. Tata! Tata! Tata! Tata! Tata! Tata! Tata! You okay? I am fine. That's good then. You're leaving without saying goodbye to anyone? Do not be so hard on my wife. Mmm. I once asked you for a favor, to give my last bit of money to someone. I want to do it myself now. I know the way out. Mmm. What is your name? I'll tell you the next time. Will we meet again? I'll meet you once for everyone you defeat. Where are we going? Suhang
