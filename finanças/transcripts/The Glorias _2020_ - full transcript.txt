- What are you in town for, hon? - Dakota Sioux powwow. No kidding. Hmm. Hey, sweetheart, can we get some service around here? You know, by afternoon there's gonna be 300,000 bikers here for the Annual Blackhills Bike Rally. You didn't know? No. No. Leave her alone. Come on. Come on. You're Gloria Steinem. I am. It's her. I told you. Oh, wow. I wanna tell you how much Ms magazine has meant to me over the years. We love your work, Ms. Steinem. You changed our lives. That means a lot to me. Thank you. Um. You see the... - the purple Harley out there? - Mm-hmm. That big gorgeous one? That's mine. She always used to ride behind me. Yeah. And I started reading your magazine and... and I decided I wanted to take to the road on my own. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. - All good? - Yeah. Voila. Who found us a jukebox in the middle of nowhere? That would be you. It's, uh, just in case. Hello? This is she. Hmm. Yeah. I bet the roads are... uh, I know they probably have a tight schedule, but... Uh-huh. Papa! The Andrews Sisters aren't coming. All right. Now, I know you're all a little disappointed, but we've got the Andrews Sisters here. Right here on the jukebox. Yeah. And we know it's the next best thing. So, let's get dancing. I am your host Leo Steinemite. Let's make it dynamite! Hit it. Aw. Whoa! - That was so much fun. - Honey, look at you. - I love dancing. - Oh, you're soaked. Was that jukebox not the find of the century? Why the long face? One summer storm wipes us out for an entire month. You might as well be playing Blackjack. Ruth, you worry too much. Gloria, Susanne, it's time for bed. They're gonna repossess our car, Leo, if we don't pay by the first of the month. So we'll park it down the road, no one will find it. We'll get out of town in the fall. Huh? We'll make a bundle doing the county auctions up and down the coast, avoid the Michigan winter. Pass through Georgia for those thin sugary pralines. Right? Drink ourselves some fresh squeezed all you can drink oranges from those Florida roadside stands and then head west for some California sunshine and slabs of fresh salmon from a California smokehouse by the time we get back next summer... we'll be on top again. Come here, kiddo, new set of maps. See? Okay. We go from here, here, and then like this... all the way to... And then what? Well, you know what they say, if you don't know what's gonna happen tomorrow, could be wonderful. Everybody in. - It's time to go, go, go. - I'm not done with the dishes. Oh, leave the dishes, they'll be clean by the time we get back. Mom. The winter automatically sterilizes the germs. - Get the door for me. - Damn It! Damn It! Come on, come on. Right here, good boy. Why'd you have to go name the dog Damn It? It's so embarrassing. It'd be more embarrassing if you had a father who swore. Don't you think? Gloria, you're gonna get car sick reading in the back. I never get car sick. Put the book down for a minute and look out of the window. I looked out the window an hour ago. Gloria. Look at those houses. Slow down, Papa, aren't they pretty? Don't you wish we lived in a house like that - all year round? - Leo, we need to stay put for a while and let the girls go to school. Gloria would be starting the third grade by now. No. Traveling is the best education. It's the only education really. Leo? I think this one is valuable. Can you do this without me? I have a splitting headache. I need to go in for a lie down. Right. There's no way I'm paying 25 dollars for this cracked tea set. Five dollars is my final offer. - Twenty. - Fifteen? Done. We're gonna sell this tea set to an antique dealer for 50 bucks. Mark my words. And all we need is ten dollars for gas money to get us all the way to Wyoming. When we get to St. Louis there's this one market, all they sell is china... Chai, madam? Only one rupee, madam. - Please. - Oh, please, no. No, no. Thank you. So you left the university in New Delhi. Why? I wanna get out of the big city. See the villages. What Gandhi talks about. She is traveling in third class because, this is ladies only carriage and safer. But why aren't you traveling in a private car like most of the foreigners? If I was in a car by myself, I wouldn't really even be in India. And I wouldn't have met you. This used to be our beautiful farmhouse. Lots of land all around. Your granny was born here, Gloria. Oh, good God. Come inside, Mom. You'll catch a cold. Firemen drag their hoses 11 stories up to reach the fire on the 79th floor... So, where's your father these days? - South America. - South America? "Buying and selling opals in Argentina. Sending you a money order, love, your pop." Are you okay, Mom? I'm fine. Would you sign this check? It's for the electric. And I... I found these papers while I was looking for your checkbook. What are they? Oh, it's nothing. It's just my old writing when I used to work at the newspaper. But it doesn't say your name. - It says Duncan McKenzie... - McKenzie. That's me. Duncan McKenzie. That's what I went by. That's the way it was for women back then. Imagine. Well, why aren't you writing anymore, Mom? Are you hungry? Do you want me to make you a baloney sandwich with red onions and mayonnaise? No, thank you. I'm fine, dear. You just run off and play or read whatever you like. Why are you tap dancing outside? It's too loud for my mother inside. What's wrong with your mother? We don't have linoleum. We got linoleum. I've got an extra pair of tap shoes. My big sister, Shirley, she grew to size 12 this year. Wait there. - Ruby? - Hi, Papa. Come and sit down over here. Papa, can I change the station? - Yeah, go ahead. - Just wait and watch. Now, here is Count Basie and his orchestra. She can tap a little bit. All right, now! Oh, what, you want to see? Back at ya, huh. Aw man. Look at that. - Hey, that's nice. - You got it. Yeah! - All right! - Come now! Whoo! I'll tell you what, you girls gonna tap dance your way out of Toledo. Into the heart of America. That's my baby. Yeah. Can I help you? Is there a girl here named Gloria? Your mama is looking for you again. Hollywood Boulevard is a blaze of lights. Thousands of people... The green steam calling me out in full force this evening. We promised to... Brand new tickets, brand new spirits. Lovely DeLove, Jean Harlow. Where were you? Where were you? I was so worried about you, Gloria. I'm sorry, Mom. I saw German soldiers outside and I couldn't find you. There aren't any soldiers, Mom. I heard them outside. The war... There's no war, Mom. It's okay. It's just those Bukowskis at it again. Did you forget to take your Doc Howard's? I couldn't find it. Okay. Okay. Just one teaspoon. This is your stop. - What's going on? - I fear there are caste riots, if you go straight to the Ashram, it should be safe there. Thank you. Do you know the Ashram? Oh, hello? I've arranged to stay in the guest house. Madam Gloria? - Yes, yes. - Yes, hi. But I'm afraid everyone is gone. - Gone? - Because of the riots, you cannot stay here. I leave today, you see? We must do what we can to help. You may come with me if you like. - Where? - Village to village. They need other women to listen to their stories. Otherwise village women will not tell what happen. They will stay silent. I see. Would you like to come? Would I be out of place as a foreigner? To a woman in rural village, a white woman in sari will seem no stranger than a man from New Delhi. So, would you like to come? Yes. - When? - Now. - All right. - Only the suitcase is too big. You're American, I think. - Yes. - Can you travel light? I'm very interested in how Gandhi made non-violence into a whole movement. We women taught Gandhi everything he knows. Gandhi watched his mother and aunties fight using Ahimsa. - Ahimsa? - Means non-violence. You will see. If you hope, people will change how they live. First, you should know how they live. Her daughter was raped in front of her. She could not do anything. She took her to hospital... People don't speak about this. But I don't understand. What does my mother have? Anxiety, neurosis... - low self-esteem, agoraphobia... - Her spirit is broken. That's a good a diagnosis as any. It's been broken for as long as I've known her. Before I was born. Here madam. "Gloria, here's a money order. When you're ready, buy your passage home by train and boat, it's cheap. Then go out and purchase the biggest star sapphire in Jaipur you can find. I'll meet you in San Francisco. When your boat docks, we'll sell that sapphire for a profit that'll pay for us to drive back east in style. Can't wait to see you. Your pop, Steinemite." You look thin. - It's called healthy, Pop. - Have another egg roll for me. Have you seen Mom? Susanne wrote and said she's doing a little better. Holy moly this moo shu is... is out of this world. Mm. Mm. Did you get the... Hmm. - Is this what you had in mind? - Fabulous. You... you are a Steinem, no doubt about it. I, uh... What's wrong? Yeah, the star is a little off kilter, not worth much. Well, you didn't say it needed to be symmetrical. Don't worry, kid. So, how are we gonna get to New York? I have enough gas money to get us to Las Vegas. And then? Well, if you don't know what's gonna happen tomorrow, - it could be wonderful. - It could be wonderful. Let's hit the one arm bandit. Beginners are queuing. Beginners are always lucky. - Trust me. - All right. Okay. Here we go. Yeah. Jackpot! I knew it! Oh, you tripled my last 50 bucks. Jesus, Pop. That was your last 50 bucks? Oh, you only live once. Or less. We're gonna run out of gas in approximately three miles. Open that glove compartment. Yeah. Put on the nicest bracelet you can find. Add a ring. Yeah, looking classy. I've never sold any of my jewelry before. But my father and I find ourselves in a terrible pickle. This is a family heirloom. Aye, criminy. Will you listen to that? I sent my slogan in a year ago for that darn brand. Double the flavor, double the fun, you know, with Doublemint, Doublemint gum. Fa, fa, flavor, fun. Alliteration. And it's two Doublemints, not three, for God sakes, two. I think it was double good, twice. Yeah, well, it... Yeah, slogans are tough. You send them in registered mail to the ad agencies. And then you cross your fingers that the bastards don't steal the ideas. I'm on a five, Harry. Can you make me a pastrami on rye? - I love New York. - Well... if you can't find a job writing you can always... fall back on your dancing. Sure, Pop. You want me to be a Rockette? I know you wanna be a journalist like your mother, but if you can't find work using your fingers at a typewriter you can always use those legs. Hmm? I read in Variety, there's even a chorus line looking for five Beta-Kappa girls over five-foot seven to dance in an outfit called the High-Five Betas. That's you. I've got an interview in ten minutes. - Wish me luck. See you at 6:00? - Yeah. I'm on my way out. I got an auction in Jersey later then down to New Orleans the day after. Okay. Remember, those desk jobs can fatten your ankles. - Us Steinems like to move. - Hmm. Sure do. - I'm here to see Mr. Anderson. - He's back office. Hmm, I see you've read some stuff at college, but... ...listen, here at the magazine, we hire girls that do the research - and the men write. - Why is that? It's just the w... You're right. Why is that? Okay. So, what do you wanna write about? I, uh... I... I just returned from two years traveling in India. The experiences and the stories I saw and heard are amazing - and I would just love to... - Look. I'm gonna try you out on a fashion assignment. American women explain an advertising man happily, have gone absolutely... out of their minds from the knee down. Good job, Gloria, and it's funny. Rare to see a woman writer with a sense of humor. Thanks. I was thinking... what about a profile on Mayor Lindsay? What about a profile of his wife? I'm sure she's very interesting. But as a general rule, I'm more interested - in politicians. - General rule. You're too young to have general rules. Look. You're nothing like our lady readers, but you're female, so try to put yourself in their place for this next assignment. Spice it up with some of your wit. We need it tomorrow morning. You can use Percy's desk. He's out on assignment. Gloria? - It's Gloria, right? - Good teaser. Uh. The coffee's out. Could you make some more? - Here you go. - Just a second. Yeah. I'll... I'll hold. Yup. Right here. - Here it is. - Thanks, hon. Oh, also, Gloria... would you mind... Mailing these letters and then... you can meet me at the Hilton, Suite 910. A hot fudge sundae, please. How about some eggs first? - No. - No? Okay. Coming right up. One hot fudge sundae for breakfast. With whipped cream on that. I just quit a job. You want a cherry on top? Sure. - Eat your vegetables, Gloria. - I'm not hungry. Sometimes you're hungry for one thing and not another. Leo! Here. Oh, you got to stuff it, Marie. - Stuff it? - Here. Just in and up. No, don't use dry cleaning bags they'll make you sweat. - You can use Kotex pads. - Work it up bunny tails. Poor little bunny. Bend over at the waist, sweetheart. A little more. You got to smile. They give us demerits if we don't smile. Demerits? Yeah. Pay cuts if you don't smile. If you don't fit into your costume. Or if we don't do the bunny dip while serving. The bunny dip? Like so. You'll get the hang of it. Oh, and one more thing, little one, don't sleep with the customers. Even if they have a member's key. Marie, you okay in there? - They need us upstairs, pronto. - Okay. Yeah. She may need to go forward. Seriously. - Whatever you want. - He's always... Oh, no, they walked out onto the sidewalk there, really, I... - Yes. - And... Unbelievable. It's been two weeks. I still haven't been paid yet. That's because we're still in training. Is that normal? Some bunnies train for three weeks with no pay at all. Lipstick on the glasses again. Who's not doing their job? I've been working nine hours straight with no break. - My feet are killing me. - Is that even legal? What's legal got to do with it? Have you had your medical exam yet? What? - Here you go. - Thank you. They want to make sure you don't have any diseases... down there. Danny, can I get a scotch and two martinis? Make 'em dry. - Maybe we ought to join a union. - Keep dreaming, sister. "What really goes on in their glamorous and exciting world, to find out Show Magazine chose a writer who combines the hidden qualities of a Phi Beta Kappa magna cum laude graduate of Smith College - Well, tell him... - with the more obvious ones of an ex-dancer and beauty queen." Where is she? Where is she? Great job. You sold thousands of magazines and now we got a lawsuit on our hands. - Oh, Jesus. - No, it's great. Publicity. Selling like hotcakes, really great. I got a call for you, Gloria, line two. - Hello. - Write another word about Playboy and you'll never work again. We'll hit you with so many lawsuits you won't be able to stand up straight in high heels or flats. The longest ears. Hey, Gloria. How about next time going undercover in the porno business? Just kiddin'. You know, you'd look cute as a bunny, Leon. Yeah. The costumes are so tight that they'd give a man cleavage. Then you could look at yourself in the mirror all day instead of staring at the secretaries on your lunch break. - You wanted to see me. - Come in. Publishing house called, wants to make "A Bunny's Tale" into a full-length book. What do you say? No, thank you. - It's good money. - I don't care. I'm a writer. If I publish that book, I'll be a bunny forever. No, those are too big. They hide your beautiful face. They're perfect. - In there. - Thank you. Let's get you a little more comfortable here. You doing all right? Let me just pull that off. Great. - Gloria. - How are you, Mom? Oh, let's not talk about me. Now, look at this. One of the nurses gave it to me. I was hoping you wouldn't see it. Why not? I don't know. It's just... It doesn't seem to matter why I was a bunny. It doesn't seem to matter that I was exposing horrific working conditions. All that seems to matter to people is that I was a bunny. I wish I'd never put on that stupid outfit. So, people saw you as a bunny, so what? You're a writer. You have a real byline. Look at that. I'm so proud of you, Gloria. This is important journalism. Those women in bunny outfits, they're gonna thank you one day. Mom, before you met Pop, you were writing serious stuff all the time. If I pressed and asked her, "Why didn't you leave? Why didn't you take my sister and go to New York and write? Do what you wanted to do." She would say it didn't matter. That she was lucky to have my sister and me. And if you'd pressed hard enough, she'd have said, "If I left, you never would've been born." I never had the courage to say, "But you would've been born instead." Martin Luther King is leading a civil rights march on Washington. - I wanna cover it. - Love the glasses. Gloria, for better or worse, this bunny article put you on the map. It can write your ticket but this is not a good idea. I think it is. It'll be a massive campaign against discrimination for new Federal laws, for jobs. No, this march will probably amount to a handful of people and be a complete bust. Really? This is huge. There are civil rights marches out there who are being beaten, jailed, and even murdered in the South. Some with police collusion. The White House is saying we'll turn off the moderates in congress, who are needed to pass the Civil Rights Act. Okay. Then what about that profile on James Baldwin? Great. He's gonna be at the march on Washington. I don't want you at the march on Washington. It's gonna be too dangerous. You wanna do a story on Baldwin, fine, great. Just wait until he gets back from DC. - Hello? - I've been trying - to reach you for a week. - Susanne, I'm... I'm so sorry. - I've been on the road non-stop. - It's dad. He's had an accident on the highway in California. - How serious is it? - It's bad. But they say he'll pull through. Okay. Thank God. He's in the hospital. He'll probably be out in a week and then he'll have all kinds of rehab. Listen, Gloria, I can't fly out there right now. The kids are starting school and... Can you go? I know you're working, but... But could you go? In a week. He should be out by then. Of course. Paging Ms. Gloria Steinem. Please pick up a white courtesy phone. Paging Ms. Gloria Steinem. Please pick up a white courtesy phone. Why was there no family here? - I got here as soon as I could. - He was here alone for a week. His death was caused by gushing traumatic ulcers, not from the crash itself, but from stress. Despair. I'm sorry. Please excuse me. I don't know why I didn't go right away. Because you were afraid if you went, you'd never come back and end up caring for him, like you did for your mother. That's shit and you know it. - Lemonade? - Oh, thank you. You're welcome. It's gonna be a long hot day. You know, I worked in Washington during the Truman administration. In the same room as white clerks. Hmm. But segregated behind a screen. Couldn't protest then. So, here I am today. Now, now, now. That's Dorothy Height, up on the speaker's platform. She's head of the National Council of Negro Women. - In the history... - But why isn't she speaking? - Of this nation. - And where's Ella Baker who trained all the SNCC young people? - Oh, Mama. Don't go on. - Or... Or Fannie Lou Hamer. She got beat up in jail and then sterilized in a Mississippi Hospital when she went in for something else entirely. That's what happens. We supposed to give birth to field hands when they need them and not when they don't. My grandmother was dirt poor. She got paid 75 dollars for every live birth. Difference between her and Fannie Lou is farm equipment. They didn't need many field hands anymore. I think I just might have a word with my state delegation leader. You always have to make a fuss. That's right, I do. - Excuse me. - ...while we are not. Excuse me. Why are there no women speakers? Oh, Mahalia Jackson and Marian Anderson gonna be singing in just a minute. Singing ain't speaking. Excuse me. Excuse me. What you just did, that was bold. It was nothing much. Then why do I always end up giving my suggestions to the man on my left, so he can take them to the man in charge? This guy on my left will be taken more seriously than me. That simple. You white women. If you don't stand up for yourselves, how you gonna stand up for anybody else? We will now be blessed with a solo... - Mahalia is about to sing. - By Mahalia Jackson. Jack told me the secret to interviewing Bobby Kennedy. - Jack? - Jack Newfield from The Village Voice. He said, um, Bobby only answers questions if he thinks the reporter doesn't know the subject or better yet, even disagrees, so... so we're gonna have to pretend we don't know the answers to our questions. You know, Mr. Bennett, that every year, there's a pretty girl who comes to New York and pretends to be a writer before she gets married. Well, Gloria is this year's pretty girl. You know what, you can say what you want, but some of us are actually becoming the man we thought we wanted to marry. Did you say something? I didn't say anything. Why didn't I object? - Get out and slam the door. - No, no, you will. You will and... And plenty of times, like, lots of times. Speaking your mind will get you in deep trouble. Right? Love the Bobby piece. You're a good writer, Gloria. In fact, you write like a man. Is that a compliment? - Funny. - Listen, I've... I've done the profiles. Bobby Kennedy, Baldwin, Bellow, Dorothy Parker, I even did the Marco Fontaine piece about the dancer I couldn't be. Max, I... I want to write about the women's movement. - What movement? - I wanna write about why the face of congress is male, and the face of welfare is female. Why homemakers are called women who don't work. Though they work longer, harder, and for less pay - than any other class of worker. - Gloria, I... I wanna write about why women are 70 percent of the productive labor in the world, paid and unpaid. Yet they own only one percent of the property. - Are you finished? - I wanna write about why masculinity means leading and femininity means following, in the odd dance of daily life. Well? Look, I'm sorry. But if I publish an article saying women are equal, I'll have to publish one side by side saying that they're not. It's not my opinion. But in journalism, as you know, you got to be objective. Is that how you covered the civil rights movement? In ninth grade, our cheerleading coach got my friend pregnant. He threatened to kill her if she told. She borrowed money from everyone. He wrote a check on her dad's account to go to a, uh. An abortion doctor. But she didn't go. She got too scared... that he would tell someone and her parents would find out. So, she... She used a coat hanger. The next day, they found her in the girls bathroom... dead. You do not have any children? Meaning husband. - No. - Why no husband? Congrats on your graduation, kid. I'm so sorry I can't be there. It's okay. Mom will be there. Well, she sold the house to pay for Smith College, you bet she'll be there. She's very proud of you. I know. Pop, how'd you convince her to marry you? I told her it'll only take a minute. Where are you? U.S. 95, Idaho. The annual Boise jam fair starts tomorrow, crack of dawn. Hey, and how's that handsome fiancé of yours? He seems like a good guy. I like him. Maybe he's not as smart as you are, but who is? Pop. So, when's the big day? You know, I'll be there to walk you down the aisle, you can count on that. Actually, um... that's what I wanted to talk to you about. I might have to postpone that. I got a fellowship to study and... and travel. Uh, someone's paying you to travel? Very good. Where to? - India. - Wow. India. About as far away as you can get. So, you're not disappointed... About the wedding? Hell no, Gloria. This opportunity is fantastic, you can get married anytime. You let me know when you get to Jaipur, because they have superlative gems. You know, I'll send along a money order. - Deal? - Sure, Pop. Okay. Talk soon. Love you. Okay. Are you all right, miss? Can I get you something? Water, perhaps? No, um, I'm fine. Thank you. So... How did you find my name? Through a friend. Oh, you're American. What are you doing in London? Waiting for a visa. I have a fellowship to study in India. - Ah. - It's a two-year fellowship. I see. I can't have this baby. I'm sorry, I'm... I'm not married. I'm not ready. And you are aware that what you're asking isn't, strictly speaking, legal, even here. Not unless it threatens your life. I know. All right. You must promise me two things. First... you must not tell anybody my name. Second... you will do what you want to do with your life. Did I keep my promise? I was just at a speak out about illegal abortion. I have to write about it. Gloria, you've worked so hard to be taken seriously. You're saying, this isn't a serious issue? - It's not what I said. - If this magazine won't write about it, then I'm just gonna have to speak about it. You can't associate yourself with those crazy women. I just realized something. What? I am one of those crazy women. Hello. Hello. I said, hello! Thank you for being here. My name is Dorothy Pitman Hughes. And I have three children. Three children that I love deeply. And the one thing I have noticed is that too many women are being forced to leave their children home alone while they work to feed their families. We need childcare and we need it now. And here to join me in the conversation is a new friend. She wanted to speak out today. - A journalist, Gloria Steinem. - Okay. Until recently, I wouldn't have admitted the equality. So, the inequality of my own life. Even though I was discriminated against in journalism. Journalism which allows women to write about women, and black people to write about black people. But keeps editorial control in... But keeps editorial control in white male hands. I'll meet you there. But I'm... But I'm here to tell you that the majority of the population cannot be its second-class citizens. It didn't work in South Africa and it can't work here. - South Africa? - Really? I have no idea what I even said. It was like an out of body experience. - You've never spoken before? - No. I figured if no one lets me write about the women's movement I may have to speak about it. There's only one problem. What? I'm terrified of public speaking. Well, that was obvious, but I'm not. We'll get it together. Don't worry about it. So, what exactly happens before you speak in public? First my heart pounds then my mouth goes dry. It feels sort of, like, an Angora sweater is wrapped around each tooth. I'm worried about getting to the end of each sentence without swallowing and... I think I'm going to die. Hm. Well, I think I can help. Writers usually have the most trouble speaking in public, because they chose a profession purposely in which they can communicate without speaking. Well, writers and dancers. Are you okay? Okay. I love dancing. I will confess that I have a fear of public speaking. But what Dorothy and I have to say is too important not to say it. Is there anyone else in the audience also scared of public speaking? Right. Thank you, um. Now, let's get to the root cause here today. Reproductive rights, women need to decide... the fate of our own bodies. All right. Everyone out of the room immediately. - Come on, move it. - Just go, go. Just go. Now! - He said there's a bomb. - A bomb? - Wait outside. - From who? I don't know. Apparently, they got a call from a Right to Lifer. It's just incredible that those maniacs don't even see the irony in threatening the lives - of all these people. - I'm okay. - Hurry up. - Let's go. The social and economic revolution of the farm workers is well under way. And it will not be stopped until we receive equality. And we don't wanna eat food that was picked in poverty. And as fellow New Yorkers, neither should you. We wanna thank Dolores Huerta who has come from California to be with us here today. - We support the boycott! - Thank you. There will be strikes throughout this country because we have shown what can be done. Every minute is a chance to change the world. Can we change the world? Yes, we can. I'll pitch an article of the boycott to my editor. We'll get you a story out. You can try. But you know orange juice companies advertise in magazines, right? Don't waste your breath just on print. Take it on the road. Keep talking. How are your kids? My kids... they're mad at me. I'm never home. Hm. I hear you. It's tough. Let's just hope it's worth it. This year, the press has finally discovered a movement that has already been strong for several years now. And reported it as a small privileged rather lunatic event instead of a major revolution in consciousness. Everyone's consciousness. Male and female, Black and white. This is the year of women's liberation. University of Alabama, Pennsville, October 12. Salem's College. Bristol, Virginia on the 13th. Florida State University on the 4th... Could you please not do that here? - Or go into the lavatory? - That's obscene. Actually, refusing to feed a child is obscene. Gloria. I'm not sure how... How much longer I can keep doing this. - Breastfeed on planes? - No. Deal with the stupidity of white people? Yes. But no. Being on the road this much... it's hard on the kids and... and, um, I need to be at home more next month. Do you think you can do some of these talks without me? By myself? Well. No. Because... I have this friend... a civil rights lawyer. Flo Kennedy. A landlord is not allowed to deny you housing because you are single. - That is some bullshit. - Yes, Flo. Thank you. Being a mother is a noble thing, right? - Yes. - So, why does it change when you put unwed or welfare in front of it? No! Shit. Listen to me, listen to me. There are very few jobs that actually require a penis or a vagina. Every other job should be open to everybody. - Everybody! - Yeah. You need to make some noise. Rattle your cage, dog, cause some trouble. You might not win right away, but goddamn, you will have a whole lot more fun. Well. I wanna introduce you to my new partner and cage rattler. Gloria Steinem. Welcome her. All right, all right, girl! What are you, lesbians? What are you, the alternative? Oh, my God. Can I please introduce you next time? It's such an anticlimax if I speak after you. It wasn't as bad as all that. Just next time, not so many statistics. You know, when you're laying in a ditch with a truck on your ankle, you don't send somebody to the library to find out how much it weighs. You get it the hell off. Thank you. I'm a loudmouth, middle-aged, colored lady with a fused spine and three feet of intestines missing. Now, a lot of people think I'm crazy, maybe you do, too, but I never stop to wonder why I'm not like other people. The mystery to me is why more people aren't like me. What do you think? The book is outstanding. How'd you get the testimony from all those women for the lawsuit? For once being a lawyer didn't hurt. - And you got it published. - Mm-hmm. Amazing. I like the title, Abortion Rap. Was that yours or Diane's? which is 88 to 77. In a jockacratic society, you can turn on the radio and hear every goddamn basketball score in this country repeated all day long. You never hear how many women die of illegal abortions. I tell you, if men could get pregnant, abortion would be a sacrament. You gotta stay on the street. Gloria, can you address this new term, sexual harassment and whether you've ever experienced it? And, Flo, could you talk about racism in America? I just wanna point out that you directed a question to me about universal womanhood and to Flo about the condition of being black. Do you think Flo is unable to answer a question about the condition of being a woman? Ms. Kennedy, what do you have to say about that? When you've experienced bullshit in one form, you're more likely to recognize it in another. Racism and sexism are intertwined. They cannot be uprooted separately. Ms. Steinem, a lot of people say your looks are why people listen to you, not what you have to say. - Is that a question? - Oh, yeah. Don't worry, Gloria, it's important for someone who can play the game and win to say the game isn't worth shit. - Have you ever been married? - No. Uh-huh. - That's all? - Yeah, well, next question. Zoom in camera one and two. Why not? - All right. - Is that your next question? Why not? I don't know. But do you ever wanna be married? Eventually, but, um... it keeps receding two years in a comfortable distance. Do you think that there's a... paradox between women's attitudes toward the fact they don't wanna be treated as sex objects and the fact that you dress very sexily? You think I'm dressing very sexily? Yes. That's a pretty sexy outfit, I'd say. I mean, I, um... I hope you'll forgive our masculine notion that you are an absolutely stunning sex object. Well, yeah. Uh. This is my uniform. Black jeans, black long-sleeve top. Minimalist, perhaps more comfortable than your uniform with its striped tie that pinches your neck and your cuffs you keep adjusting. Maybe I should wear this uniform instead and leave the sex object to your imagination. Or this uniform. Go ahead, grab my tail. That's what it's there for. We love our girls in uniforms. What's a sex object? As I said, black jeans and a black jersey, a uniform. Got a problem with that, asshole? Double, double, toil, and trouble. -Double, double, -Double, double, - toil, and trouble. - Toil, and trouble. What the hell is she doing? Not answering him. Could you rewind that, please? What were you saying? I hope you forgive our masculine notion that you're an absolutely stunning sex object. Forgive... and forget. - For you. - Thank you. Oh, you finally got yourself a grown-up apartment, Gloria. Congratulations. - It's about time. We... - Really? We thought we'd have to stage an intervention on you. Oh, thank you, Brenda, she's perfect. She'll ward off the demons that are definitely going to descend. All right. So now that you got us up to your groovy new pad, what is this, a summit, an insurrection? - Coffee Club? - Should. - All three of them. - No. I was... I was just thinking, we've... We've been, um... speaking all over the place, but our writing, at least my writing, about the movement never gets published. Does that happen to you? Maybe, um, maybe we should have some kind of a newsletter, right? Nobody reads a newsletter. What we need is a bitchin' magazine. Do you really think there's a demand for a magazine? - Yes. - Yes. You need a lot of people buying a magazine to make it work. Do you think there are that many people interested in serious women's issues? If it tanks, it'll harm the movement. Can't worry about that. Look, I can't get a single story about a real woman published in magazines run by men. Even the Ladies Home Journal is run by a guy. What do we call it? Sisters. This. As a recovering Catholic, I think, we'd get the wrong demographic. No offense to anyone here. Okay, then. How... how about Sojou... Sojourner? Yeah, it sounds like a travel magazine. - As in truth. - No, I know, - I know what you mean. - Something that reflects the community. Wait. How about Ms.? Ms. Magazine? Some political leaders, and some others, have taken to not addressing women by miss or missus. Uh. By... they've gone to the miss, M-S. Why not do that with White House letters? I... I guess, I'm a little old-fashioned, uh, but, uh, I rather... Rather prefer the miss or missus or... Well, it's not miss, it's not missus, it's just none of your goddamn business. Yeah, I can assure you some of the things... - Ms. - Well, it does have one big advantage. - What? - It's short. Oh, sorry, Clay. So we have a great cover. What do we have for the first issue? First, we'll have Judy's satire, "I Want a Wife". - Mm-hmm. - Then "Welfare is a Women's Issue". And your piece on sisterhood. Um. All the magazine people said, "Don't do a lesbian story in the first issue." So, I feel like we need to do a lesbian story, right? - Absolutely. - I agree. Excellent. And that leaves room for one more story. What about women's image in advertising? Look at this. "It's nice to have a girl around the house." - Oh, come on. - Look at this. Yeah. They go with that. With the hood on the head, they're playing a game with broomsticks. Okay. Let's not alienate potential sponsors - right out of the gate. - No, let's, because they're not gonna support us anyway. So, what do you want? What do we... - What do we want it to be? - Abortion. - What about it? - Flo's right. We all know someone who's had one and no one ever talks about it. What if we got a large group of prominent women to sign a proclamation saying, "I've had an abortion." Don't you think people will be turned off by this? This could be the first and last issue. - As it is for a lot of women. - Everyone, we're here to make revolution, not just dinner. How many of us here have had an abortion? Okay. You do realize we're asking people to admit breaking the law. If one person does it, it's illegal. Thousands do it, it's a movement. Are we gonna do this for real? We have to... right? Baby, we got to stop sucking, and begin to bite! Yes! - Yeah. - All right. Agitate, sisters, agitate, agitate. The first edition of Ms., described as a new magazine for women, is at hand, and it's pretty sad. It is sad because it is so clearly just another in the great but irrelevant tradition of American shop magazines. They've said it all in the first little issue. After you've gotten marriage contracts, role exchanging, and the female identity crisis, what do you do? Organic foods for Christmas dinner, I suppose. Not even the most Neanderthal of us like predictability. I suppose to these ladies, the most patronizing thing you can say is I'm sorry. But I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Howard? One of the responsibilities that ought to go with the privilege of comment in this space is the willingness to admit past error. Therefore, I humbly admit that I was wrong when I predicted that Ms., the magazine of women's liberation... would fold after five or fewer issues. In an era when magazines founded and led by men are dying like flies, Ms. has every right to feel proud. Oh, thank you for telling us we have the right to feel proud, you moron. - Unbelievable. - Now what? Now we work on the next issue. And because we aren't going to get any advertisements from cosmetics and fashion companies as we are not praising their products in our articles, as of tomorrow... We raise a shitload of money. I hate asking for money. Oh, but you're so good at it. Harvard Law, should've asked Ruth Bader Ginsburg. They wouldn't ask Ruth. She left Harvard for Columbia. Well, you could've asked Flo. Are you out of your mind? Last year, she staged a public urination event at Harvard to protest the lack of women's bathrooms. At least, she's a bona fide lawyer. I'd like to speak to some of the female students. I've... I've a few hours before the speech, right? Yes. Can you tell me a little bit about what it's like to be a woman at Harvard Law? Get ready. They said they can't hire a female professor because we create sexual vibrations. Shh! In criminal law, we study the reasonable man test. And basically it means, you know, the hypothetical, um, standard for gauging whether someone has committed a crime or not. - Mm-hmm. - And when my professor explains the reasonable man test, he jokes that there's no such thing as a reasonable woman. Last year, they ended the tradition of lady's day. - What's lady's day? - The only time all year when women are called on in class. Don't they usually hold this at the Harvard Club? They can't this year. Women there have to use the side entrance. Gloria. Do you realize you're the first woman honored to address this elite white bastion of male superiority? - You want a drink? - Uh-uh. I thought I would talk about why Harvard Law School needs women more than women need it. You may have seen me around campus interviewing the seven percent of students here who are female. I wanted to relay some of their experiences, from professors calling rape a very small assault... to the fact that the course catalog portrays no interest in half of the human race. There is everything from the Chinese attitude toward international law, uh, to a course on international whaling law. But none on women's rights internationally. Absolutely nothing for, by, or about women. As women, we have been studying our own absence... for far too long. What right do you have to judge Harvard Law School? How dare you! You're not even qualified to speak at this institution. Baby, just pause. Let the audience absorb the hostility then you say... I didn't pay him to say that. Three forms of address used in English. Mr., Mrs., which used to stand for mistress, and Miss. But as of today, there are four. Ms. has been added to the US government list of acceptable prefixes. "Ms.," says the government is quote, "An optional female title without marital designation." In more news today, women are marching in the streets and running for congress. Bella Abzug known as Battling Bella is challenging an incumbent on New York's west side. Helping her campaign, the increasingly visible face of the women's movement, Ms. Gloria Steinem. Good job, Bella! I wish they loved you that much in the liberal suburbs. Why should they? I'm everything they moved to the suburbs to escape, the daughter of a Jewish butcher from the Bronx. I've got to convince them that... that this girl who worked at her father's Live and Let Live butcher shop is a step up. Well, we're gonna go to all the places that people - don't usually campaign. - Okay. You need Bella Abzug as your congressperson. Nineteenth District, Greenwich Village, lower east side. It's the greatest things of all, is the sense of injustice and you've got that and I think that's fantastic. Most people in the mid-west, they don't have that. - Oh, call me Bella. - Hi. Nice to see you. Don't forget to vote. Oh, no. - You want a pretzel? - Oh, of course. You see... you see, Gloria, it's not enough just for me to get elected. We need women of all colors and stripes on both sides of the aisle. I mean, we don't want to replace a white male middle class elite with a white female middle class elite. No offense to Betty Friedan. Betty's pissed. - Why? - Because the media is calling you the face of feminism and her the mother of the movement. It makes her feel done. You haven't read what she's been saying about you? - Hmm. - No. I haven't read any of it. - Why? - "The disruptors of the women's movement are the ones trying to push lesbianism or hatred of men - onto the movement." - Okay. Okay. Stop it. She thinks you're profiteering off the movement with Ms. magazines. As if this magazine will ever turn profit. You need to respond to her in public. No, I won't respond. I... I refuse to feed the idea that women can't get along. Sometimes we don't get along. We argue. We fight. And that reminds me, I came here to tell you in person you have been elected in absentia to represent the National Women's Political Caucus - at the Democratic Convention. - No. No, no, no. Betty was actually the ad campaign that'd be elected - and she lost. - I don't want that job, Bella. That's... that's why I didn't go. That is exactly why you should have that job. And exactly how does that make sense? A reluctant spokeswoman is more likely to represent the group. I have no desire to make an enemy out of Betty Friedan. Too late. If you avoid conflict, my darling, conflict will seek you out. One may be amused this year... the Democratic National Convention here in Miami, by the high-octave span of women's voices gathered together at the derelict Betsy Ross Hotel, headquarters of the recently formed National Women's Political Caucus. One might be amused by the rooms with unmade beds, yogurt cartons, chests covered with blue jeans and bras, but only briefly. Betsy Ross Hotel is a power set. More than a third of the delegates this year are women. There's a strong women's plank in the platform. Four years ago, there was none. Can they do it or will they be torn apart by internal strife? What a day. Can you put the rest of these in the packet? There should be four pages each. What the hell did Betty do today? Well, threatened to call a press conference and expose the caucus. Same as she does every day. You know why Betty doesn't yell at me? - Why? - Because I yell back louder! Oh, eat your beer nuts. Look, we didn't get all our planks, but we will in Houston. You're working from within the movement now. Change comes from within. They want you for the cover of Newsweek. I won't do a cover photograph. Yeah. A movement is lots and lots of people moving. Not one person being photographed. Not one white woman. Not me. There would be a movement without me. They won't do the story unless you pose for the cover. I won't do it. If they want us to become the radicals, that they fear we are, then let them stop the ERA and we will become those radicals. This is no simple reform. It really is a revolution. Introducing my lovely young assistant, Gloria. Hold still. Come on, Gloria. This isn't the first time you've had knives thrown at you, is it? Yeah. It was one thing to have a magician in east 'Ledo throw knives at you when you're being paid for it. You know, and anyway those knives were dull. And it's... it's another thing to have this... Oh, let me see that thing. Wait, my glasses. Oh, I don't really need my glasses. Pin the cock on the feminist. Ah. Let them be idiots. You know, the purpose of an ass kicking isn't that you get your ass kicked at the right time or for the right reason, it's to keep your ass sensitive. It's in full, you know, detail and it has my hair, - and my glasses. - Yeah. And my labia. Yeah. Two, four, six, eight, ratify in every state... The women here represent the thousands who formed the long line of runners from Seneca Falls officially opening the first government sponsored convention on women's rights. Gloria Steinem, now that the conference is about to begin, - how do you feel? - Well, I can't tell you how thrilling it is to finally see this miracle happen. I mean, I've never seen... None of us have ever seen women pull off such a massive nationwide two-year process culminating in what is probably the most racially, economically, and geographically representative body that this nation has ever seen. So, the bar is very high. We have a lot to accomplish. Oh, my knees. Bella, how the hell are we gonna get 2,000 delegates to agree... on 26 multi issue planks in three days? By arguing, and voting, by not shutting up. It's called democracy. Oh, the Girl Scouts. God, I love a pageant. Stop the bus. This is going to be a disaster. Stop the bus - now! - Now ERA! Now ERA now! Women are human. We are united on that. No one person and no subgroup at this conference has the right answer. Wonder Woman is not a delegate here. We will not be brainwashed by those who predict chaos and failure for us. Tell them they lie and move on. The cause... the cause of equal and human rights... will reap what is sown. November 18 through November 21, 1977. What will you reap? What will you sow? This gavel was used by Susan B. Anthony in 1896. Bella Abzug, may you preside with the truth of what this gavel means to American women who are again on the move. The women's movement... has become an indestructible part of American life. It is the homemaker deciding that raising children, cooking, and cleaning, and all the other things she does for her family, should be accorded value and respect. It is the young woman student deciding that she wants to play baseball, carry a torch, major in physics, or become a brain surgeon. It is the working woman... demanding equal pay. It is the divorced woman, fighting for social security benefits in her own right. It is the mother organizing a daycare center. It is the battered wife seeking help. It is the woman running for public office. It is the woman on welfare looking for a decent part of American life. Let this conference be the beginning of making our democracy what it should have been 200 years ago! Seven miles south from the National Women's Conference in Houston, a protest, spearheaded by Phyllis Schlafly, calls itself the pro-family rally opposed to the Equal Rights Amendment. I'm very proud that they excluded me from that convention and I'm here where we're not ashamed and not afraid to ask God's blessing on this crowd assembled here today. - Oh, my God. That's Dolores. - Huerta, Right. She said she'd be coming to Houston with the contention of female farm workers, to protest abortion. - I watched... - Yeah, well, she has - a lot of kids. - Ten. Of young people and the greatest tragedy of all was to see three former first ladies of this nation, excuse me, two former first ladies and the current wife of the president of the United States standing by their very presence alongside of Abzug approving of sexual perversion and the murder of young people in their mother's womb. What a disgrace! Excuse me. Can we turn this shit off? It's different than all of them, you know. Excuse me. I'm... I'm sorry to bother you. Did you not get a room assignment? No. But this is fine. Well, is there anything you need? We could use someone to take notes actually. Well, that's why I'm here. Thank you. - Wilma Mankiller. - Gloria Steinem. We need to make it clear that while other women here gathered are fighting for equality inside the mainstream, we native women are fighting for tribal sovereignty. We're fighting for our entire culture outside the mainstream. So, chime in. Let's draw up a list of our most critical issues. What about the loss of our tribal languages? We're not even allowed to teach it in our schools. Our language is the very heart of who we are as a people. And if that disappears, that's it. It's gone forever. - Gloria. - Dolores? They told me I'd find you in one of these hallways running ragged. I thought you're across town, are you okay? Do you have a minute? I'm just... Yes. Yeah. Of course. One of these rooms has gotta be empty. All right. We've got to have some very specific resolutions for Asian-American women on sweatshops... Oh, Gloria. We could use a writer. I'll be back in a minute. Sorry. I promise to be a scribe for the minority caucuses. - I should go now. - No, no, no, no. Come here. Excuse me. You know, I'm a devout Catholic. You know, along with Cesar, I've been anti-abortion my entire life. I'm here with my fellow farm workers to demonstrate in support of the Right to Lifers, but... I looked at the faces in that angry crowd... and I saw some of the same people who fight our unions, and hate our cause, extreme right-wingers, even the clan and... I had to get out. Hmm. Dolores, you know... no one in their... In their right mind is... is pro-abortion. Nobody gets up in the morning and says, "Great. I'm gonna have a procedure today." It's... it is the method of the last resort. But reproductive freedom and... And the right to choose belongs to the woman, right? I mean, that's... that's what being pro-choice is... is all about. I have ten kids. And I love each and every one of them dearly, but... but it's been hard. We don't wanna go against the church... but we have to think of ourselves first. All these people who have an issue with having an abortion, well, what are they doing for the children once they are born? Even the church. What's the church doing to help us raise our children? Are they providing infant centers? Are they providing resources for our teenagers... Dolores, come with me tomorrow. It's the last day of the conference and... and I want you there. The president and congress... should provide for full quality education. And for the full implementation and enforcement of all affirmative action programs... Deportation of mothers of American born children must be stopped, and legislation enacted for parents to remain with their children. Would all those in favor of the sexual preference resolution, please rise. Be seated. Please stay in order. All those opposed to this resolution, please rise. The resolution has clearly carried and is adopted. The federal government should guarantee tribal rights... Asian-Pacific American women are wrongly thought to be... The current system of insurance is one where women pay more and get less. Of covering homemakers and their own rights... We would like to substitute that as follows, Madam Chairperson... And your time has expired. Sit down. I move the adoption of the following resolution. The Equal Rights Amendment should be ratified. All those in favor, will you please rise? The resolution has passed. Gloria. Thank you for standing beside us. You wear this and remember we're also standing beside you. Thank you. And you can wear this... when we get you out there dancing at our powwows. And we will. So did it pass? - What? - The ERA. Of course. They voted, didn't they? I mean, more people stood up for it than against it. Yeah. But did it pass? I don't think so. Yeah. Let's proceed. It's going to be an uphill battle. There's never been an elected female Cherokee chief before. There will be now. Campaign's been tough. We've had our car torched, death threats. Wilma just pushes on. Nothing stops her. No fear. Well, she's lucky to have you beside her. Hello. Good to see you. No, I'm the lucky one. How are you? Thank you. So, how did you two get together? When I met Wilma ten years ago, she was definitely on her own. Well, after working together for a couple of years on a water project, I started to say, "You know, I can tell there's electricity going on between us." And so I asked her. I said, "Uh. Wilma, you want to go see a movie? You want to go see Rambo?" She said "Rambo? I hate Rambo." I thought, "Oops." And so I drove to Tulsa and pulled in at a Coney Island hot dog place. She said, "What are we doing here?" I said, "We're here to eat." She said, "Here?" I said, "Yeah." She said, "I hate hot dogs." I said, "Oh, my God." I struck out here. I mean I love those hot dogs. Dang. We live in a country where our contributions to democracy have been overlooked. - Mm-hmm. - Mm-hmm. Benjamin Franklin acknowledged the Iroquois Confederacy was the model for the Constitutional Convention. In fact, he invited two Iroquois men to Philadelphia as advisers. Their first question... "Where are the women?" Now, we Cherokee, we consult our women elders on every important decision, but we've never had a woman as a democratically elected chief. Let's change that this year. Vote Mankiller. How'd you get the name Mankiller? I earned it. You earned it. Okay. It's an inherited title that means - protector of the village. - Oh. Used to be Whiteman Killer. Hmm. You know... I read that the Cherokee nation was once matrilineal, is that true? Yes. Once. And the sun is female and the moon is male. What? See, the sun is always there. The moon comes and goes. This is an extraordinary place. Your home, you know, with all its family and friends. I've been here most of my life. Do you ever go home, Gloria? Oh, you mean my apartment in New York? I think the... the longest I've been there in the last year has been eight days. The ballots are in. - Oh. - Chief? Yes. We did it. We did it. Go home murderer. Go home! In the name of Jesus! We must protect the sacred life of the unborn. Murderers! Baby killer, that's what you are! Today, I've invited a very special guest to give our homily. Glory be to God. For Gloria. You may be surprised to see me here. I... I'm surprised, too. Original culture saw the presence of God in all living things... including women. Only in the last 500 to 5,000 years, depending on where you lived, has godliness been withdrawn from nature, from females and from particular races of men, right? Though patriarchal culture made hierarchy seem inevitable. For 95 percent of history, humans have been more likely to see the circle as our natural paradigm. And millions still do from Native Americans here to original cultures around the world. When God is depicted only as a white man... and Jesus has blonde hair and blue eyes in the middle of the Middle East, I never understood that. Then only white men seem godly. Priests dressed in skirts try to trump women's birth giving power by baptizing with imitation birth fluid and calling us reborn. And then going women one better by promising everlasting life. In reality, elaborate concepts of heaven and hell didn't exist before patriarchy. You just joined your ancestors or kept being reincarnated till you learned enough. The simple right to reproductive freedom, to sexuality as an expression that is separable to reproduction is basic to restoring the balance between women and men. A balance between humans and nature. Hi, Gloria. I'm so excited to finally get to talk to you. - Oh, well... - And I'll say it real quick. First of all, I really believe that your movement was a total failure and I believe you could admit that wholeheartedly. You are one of the primary causes of the downfall of our beautiful American family and society today. A couple questions. I'd like to know if you're married. - No. - If you have children. - No. - No, you don't. Well, let me tell you. - You can't get... - Is that... Is that bad? Advertisers because your magazine blanks. So, you better go out and get a job and don't ever have children, lady. Gloria Steinem should rot in hell. Do you regret it? Not having kids? People always ask me that and I always feel the pressure to say yes, but I... I don't, and I... I never did. I always assumed I'd have them. Well, not everyone with vocal chords is an opera singer, not every woman with a womb is a mother. You'd make a terrible opera singer. But a great tap dancer. Are we there yet? Gloria, what would you say to women of color who don't feel the feminist movement includes them or is about them? Well, I wouldn't say anything. I would... I would just listen. The biggest indicator of whether a country is violent within itself is not... Is not poverty, is not lack of natural resources, is not religion or even degree of democracy. It's the degree of violence against females. Okay. Here's my best thing about instinct. If it walks like a duck and it looks like a duck, and quacks like a duck and you think it's a pig, it's a pig. The truth will set you free, but first it will piss you off. I sometimes wonder if we are crisscrossing Leo's ghostly past. Entering the same towns, roadside diners. We're so different... And yet so much the same. It's me. Um. Oh. No. No, I... I... I had no idea. I just... I needed to hear your voice. No. Um, everything's fine. I just... I just got back early and I... And I thought that if you were free... tomorrow then... That maybe we could... Oh. Oh. No. I... I forgot. I, um... No. Absolutely. I... Yeah. Um. And I'll... And I'll see you on Saturday. All right? All right. Just go back to sleep. Good night. Hey. Welcome to the post 50 free from feminine bullshit age. Free at last, sweet Jesus. Free at last. Did we raise any money? This must have cost a fortune. Gloria, it's your birthday. Enjoy it. Everyone here - is celebrating. - No, I'm... I'm worried about the foundation. Okay. Yes. The benefit tickets raised quite a bit earmarked for Ms. Gloria, eat your cake. Or dance with Stan. Look, here he comes. - Hello. - Hi. How are you? - Happy birthday, Gloria. - Thank you. So, you are still not married. Well, um, I've always said that I... I can't mate in captivity. When I grow up, I'm going to go to Hollywood... and then I'm going to get married, and settle down... and have three kids. Then a boxer. Oh, no. No, no. no. A... A Golden Retriever. And a house with a huge yard, and a swimming pool, and a basket for basketball in the driveway. And a game room in the basement with a record player, and a ping-pong table, and... and a dance floor. That's important, you know. - And a car. - Of course. A Ford woody station wagon, my own. And my husband, he can have his own car, too. A Cadillac. Convertible. No. Well, that... Maybe that will be my car. And what about love? Will you be in love? Well, yes. Of course. Forever and ever after. Why aren't you married? My relationships were measurable in... in years, not days. I mean, remember, I grew up in the 1950s, not even the '60s, so I would defend the right for any woman to have sex with a man whose name she doesn't know. But my own life has been about little marriages. Do you need a man in your life to be happy? Are you talking about sex? Or what are you talking about? Yes. Sex. Well, no. Not now actually. But in 20 minutes, that may change. Who knows? I mean... Let's keep the cameras rolling. I just wish Gloria would find a good chap and relax. Gloria comes on with that flat Ohio accent... goes on and on about women's oppression. You feel like either kissing her or hitting her. I can't decide which. Make sure you have the right temperature. Because that slut from the east village doesn't come in here. The airport, please. On Glen's lap. Hey, speaking of the shootings in Whittleton, did those kids try and have sex with any of those good-looking girls first? - Hmm. - At least if you're gonna kill yourself and kill all the kids... - Can you please turn that off? - Why didn't you have some sex? He got pretty far away... Dirty lazy people. Please. Stop yelling. I crash you. - You know... - I crash you. You know, some people in this country think bad things about immigrants - from Russia and they're wrong. - Are you crazy? I'm from Ukraine, not Russia. Ukraine is good place. Everybody wait. - No dirty people... - If there are no people of color in Ukraine then why are you making assumptions about anything? You know nothing. Black peoples ruin this country. - Fucking bitch! - You know what? That's it. Pull over. I've had it with your racist bullshit. The reason this country is great is that all of these people, black, brown, white, all of these beautiful people are on the streets in New York together. And if you don't like living in New York then you can just move to fucking Norway! A dear friend of mine. We met almost 40 years ago right here in Deli. A place where she began her journey as an activist. The greatest listener on this planet. She has lovingly been called a celestial bartender. Today, we are honored to be able to listen to Gloria herself read from her new book. "Men embody adventure. Women embody hearth and home and that has been pretty much it. Even as a child, I noticed that Dorothy in the Wizard of Oz spent her entire time trying to get back home to Kansas. Um. Alice in Wonderland dreamed her long adventure and woke up just in time for tea. But... whether by dowry murders in India, honor killings in Egypt, or domestic violence in the United States, statistically speaking, home is an even more dangerous place for women than the road. Taking to the road, by which I mean letting the road take you, changed who I thought I was. The road is messy in the way that real life is messy. It leads us out of denial and into reality. Out of theory and into practice. Out of caution and into action. Out of statistics and into stories. In short, out of our heads and into our hearts." Now... be partners forever. That's the way it'll be. So what happened to you, Miss Feminist, who used to say marriage turns women into half people? You were fucking 66 years old. A wedding? I'm utterly shocked. But partners... I like that. What can I say? We loved each other. And, uh, we're both in our 60's and hardly needed to be officially married. But David needed a green card. And, uh, who could turn down a full Cherokee wedding? Attagirl. And besides, we... we changed the marriage law, so I no longer had to change my name, my legal residence, my credit rating, right? Always the romantic. Hi. How are you? Well, you know what I always say. Every day is a good day. I just spoke to your doctor and we can park an ambulance in the yard, just... No. No. I wanna die on my own land. Gloria, you are an organizer to the end. Thank you, Billy. Are you thinking of David? No. No, I wasn't. I... I am... always remembering our wedding here. We had one glorious year together then he got ill. Oh, and I just can't get over it. Well, you never should. When I see him on the other side, I'll give him a giant bear hug and tell him. What can I do for you? For once there's nothing to do. Get used to it. Actually... there is one thing. That brace... I've had on all these years... when I die... I want Charlie... to take it out back... and shoot it. Can you make sure he does that for me? Of course I can. I will see you on the other side of the mountain. See you on the other side of the mountain. On election night, I was sitting with a group of female ambassadors to the UN. Women from different continents who are watching the results in New York. I could see from the faces around me that her defeat was devastating, not just in this country, but worldwide. Yet I know that in the future, Hillary's loss will be part of our victories. Because the path up is always a jagged line. Not a straight one. Our victory is not a one person marathon, but a relay race. When the first of many diverse women wins this highest of all democratic offices, she'll be climbing steps that were carved out by a woman before her. I feel like we're going in circles. Haven't we passed that sign ten times? A gazillion times. This is what democracy looks like. Tell me what democracy looks like. This is what democracy looks like. I and my beloved co-chairs, the golden oldies, right? Harry Belafonte, Dolores Huerta. We may be the oldest marchers here today, so I've been thinking about the uses of a long life. And one of them is that you remember when things were worse. Thank you for understanding that sometimes we must put our bodies where our beliefs are. Sometimes pressing send is not enough. We are here and around the world for a deep democracy... that says we will not be quiet... we will not be controlled... we will work for a world in which all countries are connected. God may be in the details but the goddess is in connections. We are linked. We are not ranked. We are the people. We have people power and we will use it. This is the upside of the downside. This is an outpouring of energy and true democracy like I have never seen in my very long life. It is wide in age, it is deep in diversity, and remember, the constitution does not begin with "I the president," It begins with, - "We the people." - We the people!
