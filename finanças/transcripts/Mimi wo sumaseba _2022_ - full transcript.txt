I know it's not that easy to qualify great you've been holding on to your dreams - It's been 10 years since I started writing stories - It's only been 10 years yes Shengsi strives to realize his dream in Italy I can't lose to him I used to hear sweet music every time I saw the Baron It's like music that's been forgotten in my heart that's the music in your heart I do not know That must be an illusion Maybe it's not a hallucination That's why you come here like this isn't it? That's true I'm back I'm home What are you doing when tidying things up in the room Find a lot of nostalgic old objects everything You look at the exchange diary with you in elementary school don't look so embarrassed You see, you see, "Baseball Heroes" was popular at that time (Note: "Baseball Heroes" is an animation adapted from Anda Chong's comics, which premiered in 1985.) I like Shizuku and I like Tatsuya, we even fought Xizi, you joined the new gymnastics club because you like Xiaonan But it didn't last even half a year Good evening Oh Tatsu is here you guys look happy Even though they are called Tatsuya, they are completely different. What to say Nothing to say about my Ada this love ice cream you're disgusting What's this - you can't see - what's wrong - hello - it hurts You go flirting elsewhere no - and then - oh yes about the evening dress last time it was fixed Having said that, I still think a light gray evening dress is better But you two are finally getting married. Marvelous Harada Cedar…Sugimura uh that Harada, are you free? Um Harada Um You received a love letter from Yamazaki, right? Eh? Yamazaki said he wanted to hear your answer why are you telling me this Hello I seem to have said something I shouldn't have said Hey Sugimura What Xizi said was "why are you saying this?", right? Yes I mean I don't want to hear you say this you know what that means have no idea you are so slow In fact, Xizi likes you eh me? This this It's hard for me to say that I... I like you No... No, Sugimura can't joke around at a time like this not kidding I just like you I... I can't do you have someone you like - sorry - wait a minute I like you too but not that kind of like because I have always regarded you as a friend from now on forever? Forever Yeah What about you, Tsukishima? How do I Aren't you married to Tian Ze? Marry what... Ada I'm sorry he's so nervous fine But your love has been running for ten years Didn't you make a big circle Tianze can't keep it all Maybe he's already hooked up with an Italian beauty he is not that kind of person It's just that Tianze is different from you can't tell The Bach score is marked Allegro, right? You play like that and it's just a pianist must be more passionate Yeah hungry Schumann, you need to listen to Sarah's piano more don't be selfish well understand I will Sara you need more staccato grain ok I will work hard ok let's revisit the score take a ten minute break and start over He's still so perfectionist Shengsi is so loyal to the score As expected of the Japanese "Winter's Great Journey" It's really interesting Tsukishima, come here good I read Mr. Sonomura's manuscript The places that need to be modified have been marked good but not at all Although it was written for children, it is too ungrounded. Write more realistic themes is that so That's it not enthusiastic enough The most important thing is love, right? It's the one in the ad again He seems to have mistaken us for a teen magazine The minister is from a juvenile magazine I heard it was a boy gum? Friendship you can't see this Are you still in the mood to take paid leave? Not sorry Who wants you to say I'm sorry, go ahead Can Tsukishima-senpai take paid leave? Well, it seems so Ah, I never took a break If you have nothing to do, use your paid leave to do something you want to do. Too But be prepared to resign are you serious The opinion of the editorial department is I hope you can modify it towards this style Yeah I see please Miss Tsukishima, what do you think? Eh? As my responsible editor I think If we can make Teacher Sonomura's work better make readers more like I think it's a good idea to accept the opinions of many parties. This is the standard answer Eh? I will try to modify please I'm back You're back How about Mr. Sonomura he said it would change Very good Um -Tsukishima, did you just accept it?-Huh? Editors must trust their instincts and be honest with writers just like falling in love you gotta tell him how much you love him I'm going out go well Miss Tsuda, what did you say? She doesn't even have a boyfriend. I've watched Titanic too much, I think I've watched it three times eh? I'm on your side It's not uncommon for you to be unable to express your thoughts. In this society Um There are such people Our company also has this kind of uncle who loves to talk It's always bloody, what is it about passion, love? This is a children's book To give children their dreams This society is like this now Everything must be a lofty concept I really don't like this kind of job that twists my mind Can't you just let me live as I want? By the way, how did the novel contest result go? Yeah But it's amazing that you kept on dreaming how can some Because most people give up their dreams after realizing the reality, right? Yeah too You are amazing, the same thing happened with Tianze 10 years is still a long time It's true that no one can hold on except you just hahaha have to work hard keep it up ah kitten Tsukishima why are you here? Not have kittens it's called the moon moon tell me why are you here This is my grandpa's shop Eh? That's it how are you here the moon brought me here Tianze, you play the cello really well My grandfather used to be a cellist Playing the piano with him is very happy, I like it very much do you have something you like without me… Tsukishima you I'm always reading fairy tales, dream stories, aren't I? You too, right But I can hear the cello when I read Eh? There are happy voices and there are sad voices There is also a heartbeat I see Me too Whenever I feel entangled or moved when reading a book there will be a sound what sound I'm not too sure either It's like the sound of water drops falling Although the voice you hear is different, it's very similar to me Eh? My dream is to be a cellist Yeah But my parents want me to be a doctor I can only sneak to grandpa to play the piano But you're amazing with a clear dream And you Do you have a dream dream dream I have no idea only I can hardly hear the sound when reading recently. Something seems to be missing then you write your own book Eh? Write your own story can't write It's called Engelszimmer (angel's room) I heard the Baron's eyes glow It's because the puppeteer accidentally hurt it when packaging it. Angel room angel room Grandpa saw this cat puppet in Germany when he was young Because I like to ask others to sell it to him. In fact, the lovers who became a pair with this cat were still in production But grandpa has to go home I agreed to take only one away and send the other one when it is ready. Then the war started and the other cat disappeared So the cat has been waiting for his lover in the store you... why are you crying I don't know either But… Shizuku, are you okay? I formed a string orchestra this year Based in Rome do some solo or chamber concerts Preparing for a record release Thanks to your letter encouraging me to work together Under the distant sky, you are still working hard - These are common Chinese characters, check them first - OK Thinking of this, I have the courage to never admit defeat in anything my plan is Thanks Mr. Poo, Mr. Butt, which is widely loved by children write a story for the main character Shizuku, you have to cheer up and work hard. Yuancun Studio Thank you very much for changing it so quickly I don't know if it's correct or not Please take a look first OK, I'll read it first Mr. Yuancun, thank you very much How about it I modified it according to your opinion I think it's well written Yeah Well, I'll take it back to the publisher Miss Tsukishima What do you think of the manuscript before and after revisions which is more interesting I think I think Teacher, what do you think? Ms. Tsukishima, this is the end of our cooperation. Eh? I want to work with someone who is true to my heart please wait sorry let's take a break Tsukishima what did you do? Did nothing The writer who has done nothing will ask to change the editor? It's because I failed to meet Teacher Yuancun's request write a book yourself So you still don't understand the writer's mind? People who can't edit well Can you still write a good book? Do you still want to do it? Enough go back sorry all right um sorry Alas, Mr. Yuancun is very difficult to deal with I can't be his editor Takagi, you can please Don't be like this, Tsukishima It's better to talk to Mr. Yuancun again You can't have your cake and eat it too It's good to have dreams But escaping from reality is not enough, Tsukishima Do you feel that the job of editing It only takes a little time to get it done no Do things with a professional attitude They pay your wages - Miss Tsuda - Huh? Isn't what you said a little too much? - Not funny at all - oh sorry Oh, Mr. Isono can't come Just stuff a friend in there Of course not I'm back You're back Hey Tsukishima, let's have a pizza party. Save it for you. Sorry I ate Shizuku, would you like something to drink? No need, I still have work, sorry Yeah enjoy slowly If you don't say it, we will enjoy it slowly I'll stay here tonight you really don't know how to look Eh? Shizuku is obviously down today. No way I'm convinced you're so slow Didn't sleep well? A bit Yeah What's the matter, Shizuku? What's wrong with you What's wrong with Tsukishima? Eh, sorry This is the so-called tempting, right? May be Because you know that Amaze-san is a good person, right? But I hated him You just don't see the good in him But isn't this very green tea? Tell him that I suddenly discovered your goodness? Be honest with yourself Shizuku I also tried talking to Sugimura Eh? I thought it would be nice to be friends with him But it still doesn't work, I don't feel like thinking about him more and more So it doesn't matter if you get rejected because I like him - are you listening to me - yes - then what did I say - electronic pets , right it's not that you're not listening Heyue Island Eh? A man is looking for you Yo Oops Hey little Shizuku, isn't he Amazawa from Class 3? When did you talk to him... eh not like that Tsukishima has a boyfriend Hey, I told you it's not like that Don't call me out in front of so many people Are you a little too sensitive for... why do you say that It would be even more strange to wait at the door of the classroom for you to come out so what's the matter You're a little weird lately, aren't you? Eh? When we met in the corridor before, you suddenly dodged I don't want to see the Baron anymore. Are you writing a story?

So can you find your inner voice I do not know Little Shizuku Why don't you think that there is a pool of water in your heart - water? - yes When I was a child, it was a pool of crystal clear water As it grows this pool of water jumps and splashes transform various shapes With the accumulation of knowledge and experience, the water will become colorful However, when you grow up, you will be affected by the surrounding environment or circumstances. Encounter and be affected by obstacles A pool of water in my heart freezes into ice That way you can't hear what you used to hear. What can I do to melt the ice in my heart? Just listen to your heart soul is a mirror that reflects itself Ask yourself what you really want to do you'll hear your inner response heartfelt voice like this Listen attentively Listen attentively This way you can melt the ice in your heart and hear your own voice may be grandfather I'm just making an analogy really but You see, people didn't always say - put your hands on your chest and think about it - um the answer is in your heart This practice has been passed down from generation to generation It must have worked Yes I finally borrowed this I'm going to make hamburger meat - side dishes - yes - hamburger? - well I'm going to do this - would you - probably I'm a little worried Classmate Tianze?
