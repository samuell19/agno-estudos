That's what you wanna be when you grow up? Uh-huh. - A schoolteacher? - Uh-huh. Well, why, for heaven's sakes? Because I like you. Well, I like you, too. Here. Thank you. Come on, Lisa! Oops! There's mommy. Bye, miss Barron. Goodnight, Lisa. We did finger painting in school today. Ain't you going home, miss Barron? Yeah, in a while. Well, goodnight. Goodnight, Harry. I'm afraid all the children have left. Who was it you came for? Who are you? Stop it! Stop it! You idiot! What are you doing? Oh, god! Oh! No! Please! No! No! God! Please! No! Aah! No! Oh, god! Aah! God, no! Don't! Aah! Stop, please! Let me off! Let me off! Aah! Aah! - Coffee? - Yup. - Uh, juice? - Grapefruit. How about my cereal? Snap, crackle, pop. That's terrific. You're going to make somebody a great wife someday. Oh, promises, promises. How come we didn't figure out last night that we didn't have anything for breakfast? We were pretty busy last night, remember? Yeah, we were, weren't we? Ohh! Ch, come on! We did that already. Now let's eat. I know. We could have breakfast in bed. That's all you think about, isn't it? Almost. See how I cleaned up the house for you? Anything for you. So what new and exciting things does Boston have to offer today? Well, there's a guest speaker at the Harvard club at 2:00. That sounds boring. How do you want your eggs? Cooked. Your wit is outstanding. Oh, I'm glad you like it. You don't care at all about your alumni activities, do you, Judd? Honey, it's just that I did the Harvard bit. I have no intention of becoming one of their ageless undergraduates. It wouldn't do you any harm to stay involved. I don't seem to be able to get it across to you that I like my lifestyle just the way it is. There's ice skating in the park. There's an exhibition of Chinese art at the civic center. No? Look, why don't we drive down to the cape and have lunch? Sounds terrific. We could take a long walk on the beach. Yeah. Okay, slave, breakfast. I'm starving. Hello? Yeah. Taj? When? Uh-huh. You go on ahead. I'll meet you there. Bye. Your office? Oh, Judd. It's your day off. You promised. I'm sorry, Stevie, but it's important. Stevie, look, why don't you just... Honey. Honey. Honestly... I wouldn't go if I didn't have to. I know, but... Come on. Let me make it up to you. Book a table at the racket club for about 7:00. I'll be done by then. It's my job. Yeah. Well, it's a lousy job. Listen, I hope you had a good breakfast 'cause this one's kind of messy. Dave, hey! Okay, sergeant, it's all yours. Any angles, bill? Not that I can see. Just a neat job of decapitation. Head completely severed from the body. That makes two killings in a week. Let's hope this isn't going to become an epidemic. Thanks. Okay, get on it, will you? Thanks. Okay. Let's have a look. Same m.o. as the last one. No fingerprints, no suspects, no motives, no nothing. Who was she? Anne Barron. She worked as a teacher's aide here. When did it happen? About 6:00 last night. I guess right after school closed. Alright. I give up. Where's the rest of her? This you're not going to believe. Why? Why would he mutilate her over there and bring the head here and put it in a bucket? You're the college genius. I'm just a cop. - You want shots of the building? - Of everything. - Beats the hell out of me. - Who found her? This morning, the director. She's inside. Roberts, clear that sidewalk for crying out loud! You're not going to get much out of her. She's pretty shock up. How long have you known Anne Barron? Oh, um... A couple of months maybe. She came to work here in September. Oh, such a sweet girl. She loves children, and they love her. There. Can you tell me anything about her activities outside of work? Nothing really. She worked here during the day to put herself through school. Do you know what school? Yes. She attended classes in the evening at Wendell college. A girls school on beacon hill. She was studying to be a teacher. Oh! We'll keep in touch with you. Here, miss Armand. Drink this. You'll feel better. - Thank you. - Everything will be alright. I don't want the press here until we get an I.D. from the parents. Seal this area. Go over it with a fine-tooth comb. - We did. - What did you get? - Nothing. - Then go over it again! Okay, boss. Meet me at the coroner's office with the complete reports. I'll have to go check out that girls college. Oh, that's great. I get all the routine stuff. You get to go to the girls school. One of the advantages of a Harvard degree. Kaka lrah, - "which in Armenian means...?" - "Here comes the bullshit." Not a mark on the body. No contusions, no lacerations, nothing. No signs of sexual assault. Just a quick, clean execution. Like a guillotine. Execution? What can I tell you? That's an odd word to use. That's the one that comes to mind. I'll finish this report. - Thanks, Joe. - Judd. - Taj, you remember the Walker case last week? - We found a torso in the bushes? - Yeah. How long did it take to find the head? Two days. Forensic report... nothing. You remember where you found it? A duck pond. Fingerprints... nothing. - Submerged in water. - In a duck pond, it figures. This time, in a bucket... Full of water. Wait a minute. Are you trying to feed me some of that fancy-schmansy Freudian... This is no mystery, Judd. We got a nut on our hands, a psycho who just likes going around chopping off heads. And that's your considered opinion, is it? - 15 years on the force. -15 years? And still a sergeant? Sticks and stones, lieutenant, sticks and stones. I've got this invitation to go away this weekend. That's great. I know. I'm really excited. I have a chance to go skiing. The only problem is that I've gut so much work. Sorry I couldn't be more helpful, lieutenant. But with 300 students, it's difficult to get to know all of them intimately. Perhaps you can speak to one of her classmates. That would help. I hope this doesn't mean we'll be inundated with newspaper people. There isn't much I can do about that, miss Griffin. Anne was one of our night students. Many of my girls do work during the day and go to class at night. She was studying anthropology with professor Millett. This is his class in here. - They'll be through in a moment. - Miss Griffin. Yes, Kathy? There's some television people downstairs to see you. I suppose I'd better go take care of them. Uh, you can introduce yourself to professor Millett. Don't worry about it. I'll be in my office. Thank you. It's a sort of naturalization process confirming the peace between two tribes. This is the, uh, most important of ceremonies among the asmats, the adoption ceremony. Here we see the clan preparing the man and woman chosen to become members of the other clan. They thread long plaits of coconut fiber in their hair, hiding their faces. This and similar tribal ceremonies are to be found in the remote parts of Borneo and new Guinea. This secret and primitive ritual, um... I just can't believe it. We were very privileged to photograph it. The 30 men, each from the two villages, lay side by side on their stomachs. Then 30 women stand over them with their legs astride. And the two chosen pairs of men and women wiggle through the living tunnel. And as they pass, the women emit groans as if in child birth. At the end of the tunnel, they drop their loincloths over the couples, symbolic of the rebirth from a common mother. Then the newborns are wrapped on coconut fibers like swaddling clothes. And the symbolic birth is over, and the ceremony ended. Thank you, Kim. Scenes like this are a direct link with man's primitive past. Modern man has only to take a short step to wind up in the primeval jungle of his ancestors. Hmm. Any questions? - Ah-choo! - Bless you. We'll pick this up next time. Now, do be prepared with pages... 120... Through 127. Thank you. What's the meaning of this, walking in during the middle of one of my lectures? I'm lieutenant Austin. Police department. Uh, miss Griffin said I should talk with you. About what? Anne Barron. Yes, I see. It's not that I knew the girl very well. She'd only been enrolled for a couple of months. This is the person you should talk with. Kim? - Yes? - This is, uh, lieutenant... - Austin. - Right. From the police department. She and Anne were very good friends. Right, Kim? - Yes. - I just need some background. We don't have much yet. If I can help, I'll try. Ohh, this whole thing must be upsetting for you. Yeah. Well, anything that you can tell the lieutenant I'm sure will help. Thank you. You're so kind. I finished typing your notes. You want to go through them? Yes, of course. If you'll excuse me, lieutenant. Thank you. What is it you want to know? Anything that comes to mind. Did she have any close friends aside from you? Not many. She was really a very quiet girl. A boyfriend? Yes. There was a boyfriend. Who was he? I don't know. And you were her close friend? She would never tell me. She was secretive about it. He was older than she was, but she never said who it was. Why would she do that? Maybe we both knew him, and she didn't want me to know of their affair. A married man, maybe. Something like that. How could anyone do such a thing? I don't know what to tell you, Kim. Maybe what your professor said just now is true. We've all only just stepped out of the primal jungle. Goodnight. Thank you. Thank you. How'd you get on, lieutenant? Alright. She's a little shaken up. Yes, of course. Well, she's a very sensitive girl. I think that she's more upset than she's letting on. This is miss Adjai, our exchange student. Lieutenant Austin. Hello. I'll have this copied first thing in the morning. Goodnight. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Goodnight. Well... Thank you for your time, professor. You know, lieutenant... I think you're dealing with a psychotic killer here, a maniac that strikes without rhyme or reason... Without any tangible motive. It's going to be a very hard person for you to find. Oh, we'll find him. Goodnight. Goodnight. A salami on rye and a cheeseburger. - Hi. - Hi, Carol. Just coffee, please. Coffee. Okay. Hey, you. I told you to clean the tables 20 minutes ago. He can't help it. I've never seen such a god damn stupid. Hey, you. We're up to our ass in garbage. Get it out. So now he belongs to us, huh? - Thanks, Carol. - Ha ha ha! College girls. All they talk about is sex. I ain't got no degree, but I can give a lecture on that subject. Do you want anything else? No, thanks. You're in that, uh... professor Millett's class, aren't you? - Yes. Why? - Is it true? What true? - That he fools around with all his students. - I wouldn't know. Who can blame him? A good-looking guy like that and all those horny coeds. Come to think of it, I wouldn't throw him out of bed myself. Hey. You're not walking home alone tonight, are you? After what happened? I'll be alright. Aah! Jesus, Vince! You scared me half to death! I didn't mean to. Front door was locked. I rang the bell. Didn't you hear? I came in the back way. I thought you weren't coming home till later. Aren't you pleased to see me? Ohh... Yeah. Ahh. Aah! No! Aah! Aah! What are you doing? No. Oh. Leave me alone. Leave me alone. Go... go away. Go... go away. Please. Ah... Ah... No! No! No! No! Ah! Ah! No! No! No! Aah! Aah! Our friend really has a taste for the bizarre... The old head-in-the-fish-tank routine. And to do that, he had to climb two flights of stairs. Carrying the head already. Just to throw the head in a fish tank. See? Like I said, it's bizarre. Sergeant Taj, we have a 214 situation. - That's b-1214. - The question is why. - Good question. - So what's the answer'? Beats me. Tango-14, are you reading? Over. The sandwich. Tango-14, do you read me? We keep coming back to water. Mm-hmm. Well, they say our distant ancestors all crawled up out of the ocean. Not mine. Mine came from a small town on the Turkish border. That makes two victims from the same girls school. And this one worked in an aquarium feeding fish. More water. Maybe the guy we're after is a sailor, and he thought she was some kind of mermaid like... what do they call them... those Lorelei... Why do I put up with you? Because I'm lovable. Don't you ever take your job seriously? Aw, come on, Judd. If we did, we'd end up in the funny farm. Duck pond... Bucket... And fish tank. What the hell are you eating? A sandwich. Would you like some? Yeah. Tuna fish. Is professor Millett in? I'd like to have a word with him. I'm afraid that's impossible. He's working and left strict instructions not to be disturbed. But miss, uh, Adjai... Is that right? - That's right. - I'm not a salesman. I'm a police officer, and I can disturb anybody anytime. I'll see if he can talk to you. This way, please. I, um, I didn't expect to find you here. I work here. I'm professor Millett's research assistant. You wait there, please. Come in, please. Have a seat, lieutenant Austin. Be with you in a minute. No, thank you, I'll stand. Well, then, what can I do for you? - There's been another killing. - Hmm. That doesn't seem to surprise you. When man kills for the sake of killing, there's no reason why he should stop. Do you really believe man can kill just like that? Why not? You see, animals kill when they're hungry or when they're threatened. But man is the only animal who destroys his own kind for the sheer pleasure of it. The dead girl was one of your students, professor. Don't tell me these are motiveless killings, because I don't believe it. Who was it? Kim Morrison. Both girls were in your class. I'd have to be very, very stupid not to think that there could be some connection. - Such as? - Tell me. - Coincidence. - Would you like to know the statistics on that kind of coincidence? Were you having an affair with Anne Barron, professor? I make it a strict rule never to become emotionally involved with my students. That isn't the way I heard it. You shouldn't listen to young girls' gossip, lieutenant. They're barely out of puberty. They're apt to mix fantasy with reality. Oh, come on, professor. Were you having an affair with Anne Barron? - No. - And Kim Morrison? - Certainly not. - Excuse me. I thought you might like some coffee. Not for me, thank you. I have to be going. - See yourself... - I think I can manage that. You know, professor, I think you're wrong. People don't kill just for the hell of it. There's always a reason. Insolent son of a bitch. He's just doing his job. - Don't start defending him. - I'm not... How many more cheap rumors? It's common gossip around the school. Oh, Christ! You're not going to have a jealous tantrum, are you? I don't know what more you want from me. I love you. I'd do anything in the world for you. But it's not enough. There's always going to be somebody else. You don't believe what he's saying, do you? - Why not? - Oh, god. You were like that when I first met you. I don't see any reason why you should have changed. Then you should have known what to expect. Hi, honey. - You want some coffee? - Yeah. What's the matter? You got the blues? If it's a man, forget him. They ain't worth the aggravation. They only thing they're going to take home is money. Hi, baby. How's my sweetheart? - Can I get you anything? - Like excited? I know what you want, and it ain't on the menu. Aw, don't say that. That's a nasty. I'm sorry. I'm pregnant, Vincent. You're not happy. It came as a surprise, that's all. I'm not going to have an abortion. I never mentioned abortion. How long? Three months. Why didn't you tell me about it before? I didn't know how you'd react. I should have known. That's why you've been acting crazy lately. So you're gonna let me have the baby? It's going to be alright, I promise you. How are you doing, Carol? Fine. Anything I can get you? I don't like to turn down an offer from a pretty girl, but no, thanks. Do you have to flirt with the waitress? I was just trying to be friendly. I'm sorry. I love you. I don't know what I'd do without you. I love you, too. I'm not going to let you down. Can't we get married? I'd make you so happy, I promise. I got to go. We'll talk about it later. Please, Vincent? Don't worry about it. - Okay. - I'll see you later. If you believe that bullshit, honey, you'll believe anything. Watch out. You'll never make it to class that way. - By the way, the project looks very good. I'll see you . Yes? Who is it? Can I have a word with you? Not right now, if you don't mind, professor Millett. Why on earth didn't you tell me about this sooner? I thought I could handle it. You can't handle a man like that. He's a self-centered, ruthless man. You'd think he'd have more sense than to have an affair with a student. I've been so stupid. Didn't you know he's living with his assistant Eleanor? No. His teaching days in this school are over. I'm not going to allow that professor Millett to use this college as a playground for his sexual exploits. Just get hold of yourself, alright? I really thought he liked me. Just don't talk about it, alright? Kathy, you live alone, don't you? Would you like to spend the night at my house? We can talk, and you won't feel so alone. Yes, I'd like that. Thank you. You're very sweet, darling, and unfortunately, men are going to take advantage of you. We don't want that to happen, do we? Hmm? Jeez, I hate to leave you with this mess. I wouldn't do this, but my wife is sick... - I know. Go home. - If only that damn stupid had shown up. Oh, Gary. We're better off without him. Lock up, set the alarm, and go by the back door. I know. Goodnight. Damn it. That doesn't belong there. W-who's there? Is that you, Gus? Hello? Oh, god. Oh, no. No. Oh, shit! Fucking lock. Oh! Aah! Oh! Fucking creep! Get away from me! Oh, Jesus! Aah! What did I do? No! No. Get away! Jesus Christ! No! Aah! Aah! Aah! What the hell's happened here? Oh, no. Jesus, why me? Why the hell do they pick on me? Holy shit. What the hell was going on here? Look at this god damn mess. Must've been a hell of a party. Damn bums! It's the second time this month. Why don't you call the cops? How about some food? Would you let me clean up, for Christ's sake? Make with the food. We'll take care of this. You'd think they got something better to do. This must've been some party, huh? What went on anyway? - Hey, Gus. - Yeah? Where's Carol? Beats the hell out of me. Hey, maybe she found herself a piece of hot stuff. She'll get plenty of hot stuff from me when she show up. What a mess! Be careful. Don't cut yourself on that glass. Yuck. How about some coffee, Gus? I only got two hands. What do you got to eat? I got beef stew. You like beef stew? Yeah, I like beef stew. Sounds good to me. Carol... I don't understand. I tell her lock up, turn on the alarm... It's not like her. You can't count on help these days. Hurry up with the food, will you, Gus? Want to pass the sugar? You shouldn't use that. I know, I know. You told me already. I've been feeling better. How about you? I feel alright. Here you go. What's the matter? Enjoy yourselves, boys. Thank you, Gus. - You're welcome. - Alright. Nice. Just what I needed. Mmm. Mmm. Oh! Ooh! What is it? Oh, god. - Hey, Gus. - Yeah? Ever use a hair net when you cook? Why? What's the matter? Are you kidding? I've got hair in my stew. Yeah? Mine's alright. Nothing wrong with mine. Mmm. Tastes good. Where the hell she put the stock? Oh, my god. Oh, my god! And what time did you leave last night? About 11:00. I had to go home. My wife was sick... What the hell was the head doing in the sink? How am I supposed to know? Duck ponds, buckets, a fish tank... - Now a sink? - What's he talking about? - Shh. Lifesaver? - No. - What about the kid? - What kid? That dishwasher that's kind of tutti-frutti? - Yeah. Very strange boy. - Where is he? I don't know. He's no show up two days. Where does he live? I got it written down someplace. Look, mister, we got four killings on our hands, and we don't even have a god damn fingerprint. - So get it, will you? - Yeah, okay. I get it now. Hey, lieutenant. Over here, lieutenant, in the garbage. Call the coroner's office. Okay, get on it, will you? Here's the address he give me. Section 13, municipal law... you are required to register the correct address of any employees. You get that? Ah, go to hell. Unbelievable. Boy, this must be his summer place, huh? - Gary Downs? - Yeah. - Police. - Oh. You work at the Lamplight? Yeah. Well, Gary, why aren't you at work? Is there a law that says I have to go to work if I don't feel good? The man asked you a question. I got sick. Hey, pretty, pretty. Now, what's this, a hobby of yours? So what if it is? It's kind of a sick hobby, isn't it, Gary? What do you want? I ain't done nothing. You sure, Gary? Here. Have a raisin. Gary, you know a girl named Carol Mann? She's a waitress at the cafe. Very good, very good. When did you last see her? I don't know. Try hard. No one's going to hurt you. The night before last. Night before last. Very good again. Were you ever arrested for indecent exposure? Gary, surely you can remember that. Here. New York, 1979, Chicago, January 1980... This one's a real doozy, Gary. Three old ladies in one evening. If those dumb broads provoked you, I could understand that. You probably had good reason. Come on. Let's get out of here. Hey, where you going? He's a Peeping Tom. Ever know a flasher to commit a serious crime? - There's always a first time. - This ain't it. Look, according to my police manual, it says that every officer should investigate every clue no matter how insignificant, and that's just what I intend to do. So have a good time. Hey, what... Ah, shit. Is the professor here? Uh... I haven't seen him. Then how did you get in? Do you have a search warrant? Since you brought it up, no, I don't. Then would you please leave? Or would you rather I call the police? Oh, that would be embarrassing. Then please go. Uh-uh. Very well. Isn't breaking and entering a crime, even for a policeman? Isn't headhunting a crime, even for an anthropologist? What's that supposed to mean? Nothing, except I suddenly find myself up to my... Neck in heads. Heads in duck ponds, in fish tanks, in buckets, and I come here and find more heads. Are you suggesting there's some connection between professor Millett's research and these awful murders? Yes, miss Adjai. I'm suggesting just that. How can you make a comparison between this kind of butchery and the tradition of eastern culture? These rituals existed years before this continent was even discovered. The headhunters of new Guinea are not cannibals or savages. They seriously believe that in taking the heads of their enemies, they are possessing their life force. And by putting the heads in water? They believe they're cleansing evil spirits from the souls of their enemies, leaving only the purity of the spirit. How did you know that? I didn't. - Lieutenant... - Don't ask me. I'm not an anthropologist. I only know we have three bodies with no heads, and all the heads were found immersed in water. Even the most depraved homicidal maniac wouldn't do that just for fun. We've had a few kooks in our time, but headhunters? Not too many. Is professor Millett in there? Oh, he's up in his classroom. It's not a very nice thing to do... To have an affair with someone and then drop her. I thought you had more feeling than that. Eleanor, I... - Who the hell do you think you are? - I'm sorry about that. Even so, it's my responsibility to take an interest in the welfare of the girls here. I think we know what your interest is in the girls here, and it's not for their welfare. What time would you like an appointment? Anytime that's convenient for you is fine. Do you know where miss Adjai is? She just left, professor. Will you get that thing outta the way? Hey, take a hike. Don't get so damn excited. This is delta-1. Go ahead. Over. Lieutenant, this is Taj. Are you sitting down? Over. What is it, Taj? I'm right outside Helene Griffin's house, and guess who's staying at her place out. Over. Surprise me. Our little friend Gary. What happened to Millett? Here. Have some soup. I lost him behind a garbage truck. - How long's he been here? - Since midnight. You have no faith at all. All you need to be a good cop is a good pair of shoes. There he goes. I sure hate to embarrass you, old buddy. Let's move. Hey. He's all mine. You cover me from out front. Hey, watch your ass... You ugly bastard. Don't be nervous. Does this bother you? No. Damn! I'd better get it. It's my office phone. Hello? Hello? Hey-. Oh! Oh, no. No! Aah! Helene? Aah! Aah! Jesus! Don't. Let... Leave me alone! - It hurts. - Spread 'em! What the fuck are you doing? That's the wrong guy. Where you going? Headhunting. Take it easy, will you? Where the hell you been? I've been worried sick. I did it for us, Vincent. And for our baby. Oh, my god. I had to do it, Vincent. All those women you lusted after. A family's sacred. You and me... And now the baby. And any threat to that sanctity, I must strike down. I did it because I love you. I don't believe it. You must be hungry. I'll get you something to eat. - You must be completely insane. - Why? For performing a ritual that's been accepted for thousands of years? It's this culture that's uncivilized, Vincent. Where a woman isn't allowed to defend herself and the ones she loves. You killed them all? Yes. And if you insist on having affairs with other women, I'm going to have to kill them, too. That's logical, isn't it? Yes. Yes, that's very logical. They're coming for me now, Vincent... And if they come in here, they're going to kill me... And if they kill me, they're going to kill our baby. You don't want that, do you? Not if you love me. You do love me, don't you? Eleanor, no! Don't go! They'll kill you! Listen to me, Eleanor! Let go of me! Millett! Millett! Get him! Give me your gun. I'll put out an apb. Jesus! Beacon Hill area. West on Charles. In pursuit of suspect on motorcycle, wearing black pants, jacket, and helmet. All available units to block off area. Delta-1 over. - I hate to trouble you... - What? I got to go to the bathroom. Do it out the god damn window! Hang on, handsome. He's heading south on Walnut. Somebody head him off! I'm on my way. Holy shit! Get an ambulance! Dave, give me a hand. Looks like his neck is broken. Forget the ambulance. Well... Ain't you the smart Harvard cop? - Am I? - What do you mean? This wraps up the whole case, doesn’t it? Does it? Get him the hell out of here. Alright, son. I'll take you home. "We beseech thee, dear lord, "look down upon this, thy humble servant, "and have mercy upon him. "Throw wide the gates of heaven "and cleanse this poor departed soul cf his mortal sins, "that he may find grace and eternal peace "in thy heavenly kingdom. "And as we commit these mortal remains unto the earth, "ashes to ashes, "dust to dust, "look not upon this earthly flesh with harsh judgment, "but embrace this, thy servant's soul, "into thy safekeeping, "and in your infinite mercy welcome this... "welcome this unhappy man, "that he may be cleansed of his mortal sins and dwell in the house of the lord forever. Amen." Miss Adjai. Is the ceremony over? Yes. I hope so. So, who'd you expect, the headhunter? Ha ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha! Eh? Ha ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha ha!
