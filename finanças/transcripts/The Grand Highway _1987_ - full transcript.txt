THE GRAND HIGHWAY July, 1959 I can use a drink! Those broads! They made me thirsty. That's what they get paid for! I don't want to go. Louis! Don't make me repeat things over and over. Isn't my little man any braver than that? Le Grand Highway! You sure are late! In this oven, it's lucky I can even drive! Take your lid off! Did you bring my crates? Look and see. Mama, I don't want to go! Please, Louis, stop it now. Do you cry when you go on vacation? Just think, you'll catch lots of fish in the river. 3 weeks will go by fast. And then your mama'll have a big surprise for you. I'm not going to abandon you. He'll get over it. I know, I've got five! And you brag about it? - When do you return? - At 5:50. Hasn't even got a beach. Why can't Papa keep me? Nice is on the sea. It's the tourist season now. He can't even come for the baby. You shouldn't have it! It'll be yours too. You can cuddle him. I don't want him. It's his fault... When I was your age, Marcelle was my best friend. She's very nice and so is her husband. Is he an old man? I don't know. Then how do you know he's nice? Marcelle said so. I really doubt that! Too heavy for you. Gimme that bag. Thank you. It's so hot. You too... You're heavier than your damn bag! Gonna live with the Lucases? It's only a vacation. Don't wanna go, eh? Your instinct is sharp. I've heard enough... Come on, Louis. She's a real shrew! Don't drag your feet. I don't wanna go. He said Marcelle's a real shrew. Don't be silly. He was kidding you. Are you drinking water? Is that pump doing miracles? Not until it pisses holy wine, soul-saver! Here we are. Anybody home? You made it! Must be melting in this heat. You haven't changed. So you're Louis. So big already! What have you been eating? Go on, kiss her. Afraid of red? You could at least say hello. We've got time to get acquainted. Gotta finish it. Can't be left in the sun. I killed it for you. For your first supper here. You don't seem happy. What a face! He's a bit upset by that... Of course, a boy from Paris. Ever see how Mr. Rabbit's pajamas come off? Can't make omelets without breaking eggs! He loves eggs. And a bunny won't hop into a pot by himself. That's the toilet, in case you feel the urge. No, I don't. Like mother like son! How you suffered to avoid using the school toilet. I used the bushes behind the chapel. Where the boys could see you! You like that cart, don't you? Did Pelo make it? His only claim to fame. Too bad he's not here, I'd like to meet him. He won't budge from his workshop. He could've picked you up with the truck. He knew you were coming, the dog! Drink that, it's hot. You're pale as a ghost! I'm glad you brought him to me, Claire. Should've done it sooner. I thought it'd work out. It will! And I'll take care of your little sweetheart. Feel better now?. Can't you answer? Forget it. It's a joy just to see kids eat well. Now here comes Martine snooping around. She's never seen a boy from Paris close up. Don't strain your neck, come in! Have a cookie and take Louis on a tour of your hideouts. Go play outdoors. Don't be fooled, she's not as smart as she acts! We want to talk now, so beat it! How old are you? Nine. I'm 10 1/2 almost. But up here I'm older. I'm first in my class, and without really trying. Wanna see my secret observation post? This way! What a terrific place! Come on, climb up! You can see everything from here. Even folks undressing and all! That's my sister Solange. Doesn't even wear a bra! Simon's gonna have fun! He's her lover. He's about to go to war in Algeria. So you can imagine...! That's Yvonne, my mother. A hairdresser? Sort of. On Saturdays, she curls old ladies' hair. You have this secret place all to yourself? Yeah, I'm mad at almost everybody! I throw slugs from here on nuns when they bicycle by! Or even toads if I find any. - Live ones? - You bet! The best time, is when funerals go by. Come here. You've got a front-row view. It's fun, people cry or look so mournful. Others can barely keep from giggling. I dunno what to think. Think of yourself now. What'll I tell Louis? I'm worried! Don't tell him! He hasn't asked questions, has he? - And Pelo? - He's a carpenter. Is he nice? That depends. When he's on a binge, he's a mess! But that doesn't faze Marcelle a bit. She's hard as nails. Is she really a shrew?. - A sprue? - No, a shrew. Know what that is? No, but I'll look it up in the dictionary. Everything's in it. Know what gonorrhea is? I bet you don't! It's the clap! I know that. Martine! Bring Louis back! His mother's leaving! He's already so busy he wouldn't notice if you left. I love you, darling. I'll soon write you a big long letter. And will Papa write me too? If he has time... Take care of him, Martine. Sure! I've already shown him lots of things. Simon will drive you to the bus stop. Thank you, Marcelle. Everything will be O.K. Now don't be late. Ready to go? I have to go now. Be a good boy with Marcelle. If not, I'll turn him over to Pelo! Wanna play cards? Not now, we've got work to do. Break the stems off clean. Don't yank 'em off! Pick only the red ones. If one makes your mouth water, gobble it up! Look at this big one! Go on, eat it! Tastes nice and warm. You'll see now nice it is to live in the country. Was it good? It's that man! It's just Pelo. Not exactly pleasant, but don't worry. He sure is nervous. What did you do to scare him? Nothing! We haven't even met, have we? Relax. He won't eat you! He's just a bit rough. Not like Marcelle who loves kids... and rabbits! Aren't you eating? Isn't it good? I'm not hungry. Maybe he doesn't like dead meat. Never mind, have a big helping of dessert. That goes down easy. Hello, folks. Hi, Hippolyte. You were gonna go drink alone, you rat! I got nobody at home to guzzle with. I can fix that! There you go! If you come home loaded, don't wake us up! At last, some peace and quiet! Don't let him spoil your appetite. He's not mean, just dumb. Who's Hippolyte? The grave digger. He became a lush after he buried his wife. So you've got a kid now?. One more thing she found to bug me with! Hello, boys! This was Grandma Pelo's room. Afraid she'll see you? She doesn't care! Where is she? She sleeps out there. I was glad when she crossed over! She was an old skunk too. Don't mind what I say, it's all in the past now. You'll sleep like a log in that feather bed. It's warm out, so I'll leave the window open. I forgot to go pee. Doesn't matter, you've got a pot. Don't have to be afraid of him! Are you back in my bed now?. Did you change your mind? Or is the crib too small? True, he is too big for it. Look, Pelo, you can hurt me all you like! But if you're mean to that boy, I swear I'll...! Save your breath. If only a storm would come, so we could breathe. Don't cover up your peter! Soap's not gonna sting its eye! You sure made a lotta noise last night! Our "neighbors" turned over in their holes! He had a nightmare because of the storm. You bet! Now! You're clean as a whistle! He's not likely to eat rabbit again! He managed to make us late after all. No shoes? Just like a gypsy! Yes, I'm a beggar! So the Son of Man departed this world as it was written. He offered His life to the people who rejected Him, but He trusted in the Father, intent on doing His will. He knew that the Father's aim was the salvation of mankind. Through Him, all was to be reborn. And since He obeyed even unto death, God exalted Him and made him Lord and Redeemer of the universe. Through Him, His Kingdom was born. And to the repentent thief, He promised His Kingdom, and to all men who believe in Him. Falling asleep in church! I'll teach you! You'll take a nap after lunch. Have a nice day! Is that the boy from Paris? Do you like being in Rouans? Maybe not. He fell asleep during mass. Our priest rambles on so. I didn't understand a word. If he'd use wine only for mass... Give me something to wake him up. What kind of meat do you like, boy? Fish. Did you really make this? It's beautiful. He won't let anyone touch it. Here! All the pieces can be taken apart. It's put together like a real cart. May I play with it? I'm giving it to you! Take it out into the garden. Stuffy in here. Louis, take your Sunday clothes off first. Even if Marcelle kills you, I won't ever eat you. I'll go get some more. Did you like going to mass? You're lucky not to have to go. If Pelo sees you with his cart, you'll get hell! I didn't steal it, he gave it to me. He sure must like you. He never let me touch it. Help me. Pick the smallest ones. They like them best. Sure, they're yummier! What does your father do? He's a head waiter. He works in Nice. I don't see him much. Just like mine. Is he a head waiter too? No, he drives a tourist bus. So he's never at home. Maybe they know each other. Does he drive to Nice? No, only to the Loire Valley. That's enough. May I borrow the cart? What'll you give me? I'll teach you karate. It's better than judo. My father learned it in Indochina. You can knock over Marcelle's shithouse with one hand! Don't you dare or I'll warm your behind! My beans! You little rascal! The small ones too! Was that your idea? No, I thought you told him to pick 'em. I'm confiscating the cart and all. What did she do now?. No, for once it was Louis. Look, my beans! How do they get such ideas? She even giggles! How I hate that! I'm busy at Dede's tomorrow. Will you watch Louis? I can't. I'm taking Martine to Nantes. To the doctor? Why? For her flat feet. She always takes her shoes off. I can always take Louis along. No, Pelo'll watch him, since they get along so well. Shoes... Lucky she doesn't take something else off! Are my beans good, anyway? Not even expensive canned beans are that good. Don't you like the cart anymore? Yes, but... You watch him tomorrow. We can manage... man to man. Is that my newspaper? Louis, take the bread back to the bread bin. Drunk again. I don't blame you. The monthly rag is an ugly mess. Is that blood? Just about. That's where we come from. We never really get out! Whatever we do, everything pulls us back to the womb! You'll see. What was he saying to you? You didn't find the bin? Pelo said it's an ugly mess. It's normal. My mama and my sister have monthlies too. Solange told me I'd soon have mine also. What are they for? So you'll know if you're expecting or not. If you get 'em once a month, there's no baby! If not, you're stuck! You mean you can get a baby every month? I guess so. Come and wash your feet! We'll miss the bus! What a bore! What's wrong? She wants to buy me shoes cripples wear! If she thinks I'll wear 'em, she's out of her mind! Is it smooth? Is it smooth? You bet it is! As smooth as an angel's behind! Will you teach me? I haven't got time. Just watch and you'll know a lot already. And she has to work? Her husband keeps changing jobs, "forgets" to send money. She can't raise a kid alone. And she'll soon have two. What work does she do? She's a typist in Paris. Too bad. She was so talented. For what? For drawing, although I'm no judge. Could've been a painter. When you have kids...! What's the boy like? He's cute, but as nervous as a girl. Are you keeping up the pace, my sweets? Who plucks your feathers, you rooster! That's all for today. Is the boat finished? Nearly. Don't forget your cart. May I keep the pieces of wood in it? Of course. I'll be a carpenter some day. And you won't be as dumb as Pelo, thank God! Hurry up or Marcelle will bawl us out. Does she talk about me? I don't remember. Didn't she say I was mean? What do you think? Am I mean or not? I don't know. Yet it was my fault you had bad dreams the first night. But forget all that now. I don't know much about children. So I'm a bit wary at first. Just like you. What's the clap? Did you have a snack? Should've taken a snack along for him. You must never let kids go hungry. Poor Louis, you must be starving. No, I had fun. But that's not enough. Come shopping with me. I'll buy you a pastry. How is your wine? Come on in and see. Is there a beach here? No, she's going to the graveyard. It's her mania. Is she crazy? All she can think of is her grief. Everybody in bed now. Good night, honey. Maybe your little brother'll knock on the door tomorrow. Maybe it'll be a girl. What do you want, a brother or a sister? It doesn't matter. Anyway, it's God who decides that. Does it hurt when a baby comes out? Don't you worry. The second one's easy as pie! Anybody home? What do you want? It's not for me! It's Pelo. O.K. I get it. Where is he? He couldn't get past the pump. I tried, but he's too heavy. Too drunk, you mean. Now get home before you drop. The bastard's heavy! There you are. You still love me enough to do this? Get up! I knew it! Good kind Marcelle. She doesn't help the drunk out of kindness. It's only because she's ashamed! But I am not ashamed. I'm not ashamed! Heavy, aren't I? God helps those who help themselves! Help her! No, God won't help you! "For better or for worse"! After that, work it out yourself! Get up! We've already had the worst, dammit! Shit, let's have some of the better! Let's do it in the wheelbarrow! You bitch! You bitch! He can sleep on the floor. I'll get you! Shit, it's red. I'll get you yet! Open up! Open up! There you are. What luck! I bet I can make you come out, you bitch! We need air in here! It stinks! Get out of there! Gotta destroy this! Get out of here! Stop it! Stop it, I beg you! Wreck the museum! Out with the relics! You have no right! You bastard! I have a right to destroy what I made! You have no right! I've got you now, you bitch! Go on! I'm fed up with life with you! Strangle me! You'd like that, but that's not what I want! This is my right too! Just ask your priest! Don't get too much sun, you'll get sick. Stay in the shade now and drink some water. Come on and play. No cripple shoes? No way! I hide 'em when I go outdoors. Why does she always take a rake to the graveyard? To scratch her husband's belly! Wanna see? Why? It's fun to see pictures of dead folks! Let's go. Not like this. Dummy! No one'll see you. He's funny with his mustache. Looks like a president. How did he die? He drowned in the Loire with his son before the war. But they only found him. She goes to the Loire often. She watches all day hoping her son'll come out. Did they go to the Loire to swim? No, they went night fishing with a lantern. A tugboat didn't see them. And bang! It split their boat in two. Did they sink? Obviously! They found him 3 days later covered with civelles! Coming out of his nose and even his eyes! Civelles'll eat anything. What are civelles? Idiot! They're baby eels. Like maggots. With little black eyes. They're awfully good in salad dressing. - Wanna taste 'em? - I sure don't! At least come and look at 'em. What are you getting into the fridge? Just to show Louis the civelles! They're still wiggling. They refuse to die. Come on! They won't jump on you. Come on, I said! See their eyes? Yes, I see 'em. No you don't! Gotta get closer. Look how funny they are. You little bitch! Stop all that noise! What did you do to him? Nothing! He was scared of the civelles! I saw your "civelle"! Pelo's back! Run for shelter!... It's me! Was that the doc heading for the rest home? It was a Peugeot. Smells like death. If the priest is next, I'll be making a coffin tomorrow. There he goes. What did I tell you? Hi, everybody! Do you bury 'em before they die now?. I just saw the priest chasing the doctor. I wanna dig while it's cool. I won't start the pine box yet. Those nuns still owe me for 2. Better pay or I'll use plywood. I gotta dig before it gets dark. Then run along. Conniving nuns! - Who's gonna die? - An old woman. - Why is she dying? - She's very old. Nonsense! If they'd left Pauline in her home... ... she'd be alive and kicking now. Those nuns made her take a short cut. Guess who'll get the house?! It's your bedtime. I'll bring the potty up. Don't bug him with that pot. Gotta learn to piss like a man! Against a wall! Hit it and you're ready for girls! Not too close, Louis! Hot walls attract snakes! Is that true? Don't worry, the "snake" is back there! Heck, I almost hit it. You'll manage some day. There's no hurry. What'll we give Pauline, yellow or white ones? Golden ones! Golden ones then. Is it real gold? Of course. If you steal my handles, you can go live in America like an oil king! It's not gold, it's brash. You mean brass. Why are there so many dead folks here? No more than anywhere else. But in Paris, nobody notices. Gotta keep the metro running, see? Here, they have time to see others die before they do. They can get used to the idea. And the day they go into the hole, they know the guy who dug it, and the people around 'em. Aren't they mad at Hippolyte? Not a bit! They know he won't stick 'em beside the wrong people... And make it as bad as before. He won't put the husband next to the lover. And Hippolyte's turn will come too. I'm scared of that graveyard. No need to be. It's nicer than crowded city ones. Here, even if you've got dirt over your face, there's room to breathe! Then will you leave holes? No, I don't plan to. Get out or I'll nail you inside! You're about to have babies too. Are you scared? Not a bit! That's all she ever does. Get lost! You're mean! It was just a joke. Come on and play. Not with a girl ever! You'll have to! I gotta take care of you... ... while Marcelle's at the funeral. The handles are brass. I know. Mama has the same ones on her dresser. Come on! Not much of a funeral. Once they buried a guy whose head was cut off! On the guillotine? He was on a motorcyle behind a truck that lost a sheet of glass. But he stayed on and even... ... passed the truck! The driver fainted when he saw no head! Liar. That can't be true. Just like a chicken with its head cut off! I don't believe you. O.K., but the story about the civelles was true. Come here! Your father's on the phone! At least admit it! You sneak around! You're cunning! Like a big spider about to pounce! I know you only too well! You're going nuts. That's it, tell everybody I'm going mad! You'd like that. No, stay here and listen to what I have to say! I know it all by heart! When you saw he liked me, you did your best to spoil it! You're not his mother. Almost! Claire is like a sister. You go to the graveyard too often. Louis is alive! Alive! One more thing: stop bugging him with your religious crap! The rumor is he hasn't even been baptized! And I'm taking him fishing next Sunday! He hurt your feelings? Certainly not! He has done everything he can to hurt me. But it stopped hurting me long ago. Are you crying? Certainly not! It's just a runny nose. You're crying. No! But I'm gonna peel onions and that makes my eyes water. Now go out and play! Or your eyes will be running too! Did you catch a lot of frogs? With legs bigger than the ones on your boy there! Where were you hiding them? He sure has grown fast! Gotta hurry, I got lines out. Run along then! Is she a tramp? No, I bet Froggy Mary's got a mattress full of millions... after 50 years of selling 'em to all the restaurants. Can you eat frogs? Only the legs, but they're fabulous! She thought you were my father. She's lived alone in swamps so long she's senile. More fun than mass. It sure is. You're like me, you don't believe all that stuff. Heaven's nice though, for people who are dead. Maybe not. Imagine the whole town on vacation up there! On only bread and water! I'd prefer hell on earth or even Hell itself! Hell is where the best broads are, who can't get enough! They ruin your health, but never your nerves! But talking won't make the fish bite. Maybe that's it. You said not to talk. Right, I open my big mouth too often. Let's try another spot. You wish Marcelle was like that? Like what? "Can't get enough," like you said. She used to be once. When we first met, we had lots of fun. We'd go dancing. Then we came home in the truck. The same one? Yeah, it was brand new. We were often in such a hurry we pulled over to the side. To kiss? Yeah, to kiss! And pretty soon, we were out in the daisies or under the tarp. On the ground? You'll find out. With hay under you and stars above, the world can be beautiful! How did Jean-Pierre die? Did Marcelle tell you? No, I saw her go to his grave. He was to be born a few days after you. And he wasn't born? A birth isn't always easy. We had only one old doctor. It was done at home then. No one went to hospitals. And so he died? Is that why Marcelle's always mad at you? For that and all the rest. Grown-ups have problems. It's not easy, you know. That's enough fishing for today. Or we'll miss the bicycle race results. Let's go! I caught two. But Pelo caught the big ones. Don't expect me to clean them! Why? Don't you like fish? Yvonne'll take care of him tomorrow. Come on, we'll clean 'em ourselves. I'll tell you the rest. Marcelle almost died afterwards! A nun gave her injections 3 times a day. When she got well, she didn't want to with Pelo anymore. No way! I heard my mother tell Solange. Didn't want to what? How stupid you are! She didn't want sex anymore! - Really? - You bet! Don't complain if you get sick! They're not ripe. Don't complain if you get a baby! I know where you're going! She can't tell on me. She knows I'll get even. - Where's she going? - To pick "mushrooms"! We've got enough now. We'll never eat 'em all. Dirty boy! Why do you always stare at my pants? I don't. You keep showing them. Liar! I saw you when I was in the tree. Admit it, you're curious. You've never seen a girl's wee-wee, I bet! Yes I have. I bet you haven't! Want me to show you? - Yours? - Are you kidding? Come and see! Free of charge! Promise not to tell a soul! Take off your sandals. Wait a second. Now do you see what Marcelle won't do with Pelo anymore? Why does Solange do it if it hurts that much? You moron! It doesn't hurt her, it feels good! She loves it so much she can't stand it! "Oh! Yes! Don't stop!" I think you need to come to confession. Why didn't you come to mass yesterday? Pelo took me fishing. Will you save your soul by catching sunfish? Be there next Sunday. Shit, I didn't see him coming! But God sees you! Do we have a soul? That's all hooey! I don't care, I'm a Buddhist! God has nothing on me... I go to church once a week! I go to heaven when I like! Do you believe me? If you're brave, I'll prove it! When no one's here, sometimes I play with 2 fingers. Don't touch, those things make an awful racket. Come on! Come on! My shorts! You're lucky it didn't go up your hole! Are you coming? Did that nun see us? Heck no, she only wakes up for meals! Look at the bell! It's awfully big. Up this way. Go slow or you'll break your neck! Go ahead, it's safe. You're gonna be amazed! Come on! It's awfully high. We're only halfway up! They started some repairs, and they left the ladder. So we can go all the way! I'm not going. Fraidy cat! I've been clear up ... to the cross. It's easy! It's flat. All you do is walk like a sleepwalker. No, we'll break out necks. If a girl can do it, you can't chicken out! But you're 10 years old. Come on or I'll go down the other side and leave you up here! What's wrong? Don't be a scairdy cat! I got a tummy ache. That's the apples. Hurry up or you'll shit in your pants! Haven't we got a nice view up here in heaven? The ocean's there, but we can't see it. I'd like to go there. Have you ever been? Only once and it was raining pitchforks! Shall we go down now?. Don't chicken out! We said we'd go to the cross. Look, it's easy. Meet me at the cross. Do like me. Don't look down or else... splattt! - You left them alone?! - I'm going shopping. Don't worry, they're under the apple trees. Those green apples'll give 'em the runs! They're already thick as thieves. You're almost there. Keep going slowly. Grab my hand! See how easy it is. Look, Solange has finished with Simon. She'll go home looking as innocent as the Virgin! I wanna go home too. No, pee into the gargoyle first or it doesn't count! - Pee where? - There! It's fun! It sprays out down below. O.K. but then don't watch. O.K. I've seen your weeny already, anyway. Oh! Sweet Jesus! Tearing your pants just to climb trees and get sick. You won't play over there anymore! Are you yelling at the outhouse now?. Martine fed him apples, now he's got the runs. That's better than a broken leg, so shut up! So you defend him now! You can come out, she's gone now. That'll teach you to show off in front of girls! Careful or they'll hook you! I need it before he leaves. Don't worry, you'll be beautiful. Try on the skirt. It's too long. Make up your mind. He won't even notice when he yanks it off! He understood that. Nonsense! Not at his age... A letter! I think it's for the boy. Louis, it's from your mama. "Dear Marcelle and my darling Louis. "I'm fine, but with this heat wave, "I wish the baby was already here." Poor Claire. It's hard enough as it is. Isn't the baby out yet? I'm getting to that. "He kicks a lot and I have to lie down often... ... because of the contractions. They've stopped now." Your little brother wants some fresh air! What are contractions? I'll explain later. "I can't write any more now. "I have to go buy things I'll need in the hospital." The hospital? The maternity ward. "I hope Louis isn't too much work..." This is for me... "I'm enclosing a postcard from Papa." Let me see it. Let me finish: "He works hard, but he thinks of you a lot, Louis, "and he sends you his love along with mine." There's nothing on it. What do you mean? Either he forgot or he sent the wrong card. The same thing happened to me. It's not from Papa! Yes it is! Look, there's an X on the hotel. He must work there. Sure, and that's his room where the X is. I know that card. I saw it last year! What are you talking about? It was in our buffet drawer! Mama put it in the letter to make me believe that. Where'd you get that idea? You're a liar! You're a liar! He's far away by now. I just couldn't stop myself! Let it go! Martine'll comfort him. I believe I hit him too hard. When I think of all the slaps I got...! I was about to make rabbit. Better change the menu. I can still see the marks. Mama says that helps the circulation. Yours must be going wild! Forget it. Marcelle must feel worse than you. I don't mind her. That's not it. It's your father? Mine's the same way. One day he just walked out! Mama told me he was travelling... ... but I knew it was a fib all along. Is he gone for good? You bet! He ran away with a salesgirl in town. But she spends all his dough. So it must be the same with your father! Can't be. My father's not like that. Says you! Old men are all like that. They see a girl's ass and... bing! They ditch the old lady! Can't be! My father's not old! And Mama's much prettier than a salesgirl! Maybe they don't love each other anymore. It's better than fighting like Marcelle and Pelo. It's not true! He didn't run away! You're a big liar! Come back! I only said that to tease you! Your snack's ready, Louis! What is this? What have you done? Come here, you hoodlum! Come out! I know you're hiding in there! Come out or I'll go buy a whip! I'm gonna get mad! I'll sell them all to the butcher! You'll like it when he makes p?t? out of 'em! O.K. they'll be p?t?! Never mind! You! Are you hiding him then? No, he ran away, that's all I know! What for? Because I slapped him? No, it's his father! Why? What'd he say to you? He's scared his father ran off and left his mother! You haven't found him? Martine says he ran away. Did you see Louis on the road? No, what's wrong? - He ran away. - He was crying like crazy. We'll go look for him! Maybe he's in the shop with Pelo. Go look and bring Pelo! What's going on? I can't fix it! Louis ran away because of his father and Marcelle slapped him. What're you saying? You gotta come quick! Louis, answer me, honey!... Where can he be? - He's not with you? - No! Well? Can't you see he's not with me? We gotta find him fast! Maybe he's hiding just to bug you! Why did you slap him? I'll explain later! Take the truck... ... and go see if he went to catch the bus! It's busted! I'm trying to fix it! We'll use my car. You go alone. People must've seen him. I'll go ask around. Me too! I know all the hide-outs! I'll go phone from Yvonne's! They wouldn't let him take the 6 o'clock bus. They wouldn't let him on. He might talk the driver into it. Blessed hay fever! First time I ever saw you two run to the church! This is no time to joke. Louis ran away! Have you seen him? Answer me, have you seen him? He's up there! He peed into the gargoyle to get us wet! Nonsense! I showed him how! He's up there, I tell you! He couldn't get up there! How d'you get up there? I'll show you! Over the holy water and up! I see. But this is locked. That won't stop 'em! Run and get Marcelle. No, I'm going up too! I'm going to get my keys. She gave birth to a boy. That's one less worry. - Was that a nurse? - Yes, thank God! Oh God, if ever... I did it! I found him! He's on the roof! So there you are. Some acrobat you are! Did Martine show you that gargoyle trick? Pretty good aim. You almost baptized the priest! Stay there. I'll move the ladder. Wait there, I'll come up after you. Go away! I'm not coming down! You really feel bad, don't you? Up there! By the cross! Don't yell! Why isn't Pelo there? Maybe he got dizzy! Did you run away because Marcelle slapped you? I don't care about that! Or Marcelle either! I hate you all! I hate you all! Don't say that... Don't move! You know, Marcelle and I really enjoy having you. That's not true! You quarrel all the time! You're mean, both of you! Don't go that way! Stop, Louis, or you'll fall! I don't care if I fall! It'll serve Papa right! Louis, come back! If Mama dies having the baby, I'll be with her. I'll be with Mama. He fell into the gutter! Call an ambulance, maybe he's injured! There's Pelo! I found the keys at last! Are you O.K.? Answer me! Are you hurt? My rabbit...? A fine time to ask that. I don't think he's hurt! We're coming to get him! Well, doctor? Nothing. A few scratches. He's a pretty lucky boy! A real miracle, wouldn't you say? Not a miracle, but a little help, that's sure! Anyway, it calls for a drink! Let me prescribe some wine, doctor! Usually I do the prescribing! I could use a drink too, after a fright like that! Guess who came while you were scaring us to death? The firemen? No, silly! Your little brother! They phoned. He's fine and so's your mama. Are you happy? What's his name? Michel... like the cookies! Beat it! Haven't you done enough for one day? I want her to stay with me. Not for long. I'll get you some broth. You skunk, you sure did scare us! Were you afraid? You bet! If you'd died, they'd have blamed me! See? I was brave enough to go pee into the gargoyle alone. You did even better than me! You used the roof for a slide! Did he fall asleep? After what happened, all you could do was go to a bar! But am I drunk? The priest gave us some holy wine. He says it's a miracle! But he couldn't have found smaller glasses! Don't be sacrilegious Poor Marcelle. You should dance a jig to know he's alive. If your God did help to save him... ... He doesn't deserve your mouth any more than I do... ... and so now good night. But what if he'd been killed?! That's just it, he wasn't! He almost died and I should dance a jig! But he's alive! And he'll stay alive if people like you don't make him unhappy. I'd have died if he had fallen! Will you stop it. Stop it. You're crying over yourself. You keep carrying your cross! You must actually enjoy it! Unless it's just to make me miserable. What about me? Do you think I...? What are you doing up, sweetheart? I can't get to sleep. You'll have to try. Go back to bed. I want to stay with you two. I see how it is. Come here, son. You need some herb tea. Stay here! That's not what he needs! You didn't like being alone in Grandma's room? May I turn out the light? When is Mama coming for me? As soon as she gets out of the clinic with the baby. Now it's your turn to sleep like a baby. If Pelo doesn't snore. What time is it? Are you in a hurry to leave us? I don't blame you. Give her time. Do you think she's on the way now?. Has been for hours. I bet she's as eager as you are. What're you doing? I can't leave it like this. I gotta go out on a job, so Simon'll pick Claire up. You'll never meet her! Ought to be able to fix this. Better use it for kindling. Go see Louis before you leave. Else he'll be unhappy. Why is our tomboy so sad? Is it because vacation's almost over? It's because your shoes hurt. Go tell Louis good-bye. Mind you own business! You look so glum. Come on, kiss me, sweet pea. I'm going away too. To war. And I may not come back. I don't like to hear you say that. Yeah, but who knows how this mess'll end? With a wedding! Oh, there you are. - What're you making? - Not soda pop, that's for sure! Is it wine? You bet! I'll add rum to make it 30 proof! - So you can get drunk? - What do you care? I came to say good-bye. Well, I have to go now. We gotta go catch the bus. - Will you come back? - I don't know. Then you're a dumbbell. Good-byes aren't easy... Well, let's try... Le Grand Chemin! Be very good to Mama, kiss your little brother... ... and remember to send postcards to Marcelle and Pelo. - Even with mistakes? - Even lots of 'em! - I'll send a picture of the baby. - Yes, please. Get in, Louis. See? Your vacation wasn't as bad as all that! - Going to Nantes? - Yes. Thank you again. Don't mention it. Shall I bring Pelo's "assistant" back next year? Yeah, now beat it! They're in the bus now?. Started smoking again? He forgot his cart. I'm just dumb! I can't help it! That's it, have a good cry. English Version Bruce Lowery Subtitled by Duncan Taylor, September 2004
