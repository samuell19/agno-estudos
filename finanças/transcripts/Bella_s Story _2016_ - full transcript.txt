It was hard enough to get a good job in this town, and I don't want to lose it. You know all about the fishes, 'cause you're at home in the slime. You've put your finger on all the bodies that have been buried, but you won't tell. Guess I'm not supposed to ask you if you've been following me. Why? No. But I suppose it was all right. Wouldn't you say that gives you control of these bookies? No, I wouldn't. That's what they like to say about me, czar of the bookies, that's nonsense, it isn't true. I lend money just like a bank does. You can forget this guy, we can get Ackerman. We will, we've got Conelly. Don't talk, Jerry. Oh Jerry. Call. You sure you wanna do that? All in. Alright. This just got interesting. Full house. Aces over twos. Oh my god. Sorry Danny. That sucks. Wait, what? What are the odds? What are the odds you'd deal quads? What, you think I don't know this game is rigged? What's your cut? Huh? No one forced you to play. Yeah, great job dealer, great job. That's on you. No one forced you to play tonight Danny. That's on you. Come on man, take it easy. Grab your coat. Yeah I can walk my own self out. Hey what's your problem? Hope you feel good about yourselves. That's my niece's tuition.

You don't have it? Bell I'm trying to enjoy my breakfast so can't this wait? I need to get this in before the deadline, Uncle Danny. This is more important. I'm sorry Bella, I don't have it. What? None of it? No, I promise I'll get it. Are you serious? I can't believe you. And take a shower for God's sake. You reek of liquor and all ins. What's up Bella? Where you going pretty lady? Juanito, give me my hat and move. What was that? You should be lucky I'm even trying to talk to you. I don't like you. Stick to your business with my uncle and leave me alone. Alright. Tell your uncle he can't run forever. I want my money. Get in line. See you later Bella. Damn girl, don't you know how to knock? What's if I was naked? There's nothing to see anyway. Yeah, says you. Getting ready? Yeah. I don't wanna leave anything to last minute. Yeah. What's the matter? You're really leaving, huh? Yeah, just Boston. I'll be back by Thanksgiving, maybe even Christmas. Besides, you'll be busy with school too. You are going, right? Doesn't look like it. My uncle doesn't have the money. What? I thought he was saving it for you. I shoulda never trusted him with it. Why did you? Well, I only had half the money. And he said he knew a way that he could double it in one night. So I said yes. He was so sure he could score with it and I believed him. Bella I'm so sorry. Is there anything I can do? Don't worry about it. No, we both said we were gonna leave together. I don't wanna see you stuck here either. If it's meant to be then it'll happen. You're my best friend. I just want you to be happy. You're gonna get outta here. You're gonna see the world and you're gonna be a writer. I'm going to miss you. I'm gonna miss you too. Hey Deanna. How are you today? Hey. I'm good. I got your favorite. I don't have time for a song today but you're going to sing for me, right? I definitely will. You just so good to me Bella. Well I better get inside before Mr. Cliff comes out looking for me. Okay baby. Hey everybody. Bella. Like I said, you know they gonna win the MPP this year. Hey man let me tell you, me and this dude go back further than the Bronx airline. Bella, Bella you're killing me. Why do you keep giving that woman reasons to loiter in front of my shop? What? Wow, you see everything. And she was out there before I started working here. Yeah and you know how many time I've run her off. Come on, gimme a break with her already, please. Yo yo yo Danny. Hey listen, hey man when you gonna pay me back that 50 bucks you owe me? I don't owe you 50 bucks. Oh I figured since you owed everybody else you probably owed me too. I got him. Ya'll seen him do it. How's everybody know? Bella say something? It gets around pretty quick when you play high stakes like you were last night. Cliff, can I talk to you in private? Sure. Come on in. Hey Bruno. Hey Bella. You still read the paper? You know you can get news on your phone nowadays. Call me a dinosaur, but I love the way a newspaper feels on my fingertips. Plus, less radiation going through my veins. Well if you say so. Take care of her this time, huh? Yeah. I'd like to talk to Cliff. Can I go in? Sure, go ahead. Hi Cliff. Can I come in? Sure, yeah. Thanks. Have a seat. So, what can I help you with? Why was my uncle here? Bella I, I hear that you're having money problems. Uncle Danny said I had money problems? He's the one with money problems. He was supposed to be saving my money for school. Ask him where that's at. Oh right, you can't because he doesn't have any of it. Bella, stay calm. Did he tell you where the money went? Or does he owe you too? No. He came here for something else. Something else. Now look, I think I can help you with your problem. I know someone who works over at the university. She owes me a favor. Will you call her? Yes Cliff, I sure will. Call her! Bella. Hey. Bell! Dinner's ready. Yes I'll send you a list of potential students by tomorrow. Mrs. Mackie, your 9:00 o'clock is here. Will do, thanks. Bella, right? Yes ma'am. Have a seat. So Clifford says you wanna try and get into school? Yes ma'am. You're gonna have to say a little more than yes ma'am. I have to know how to help you. You want some water? Yes ma'am. Yes, I would like some water. Shari a couple waters please. Look, if Danny's not in the house, we leave a message. Not home. Done. So tell me about yourself and your desired major. Journalism, actually. - Anything? - I got nothing. Nothing here boss. You will be eligible for all those scholarships that we talked about. Just gather the documents requested, get 'em back to me and I'll help you fill out the rest. Thank you so much Mrs. Mackie. My pleasure. You should be able to enroll by next semester. I can't thank you enough. Thank you. Bella can we talk? I'm getting dressed. Besides, there's nothing to talk about. Yesterday, I... Save it. I'm handling it. I don't need you anymore. Now leave me alone. Bella! Where are you going? What are you wearing? I know. I feel really awkward. So you don't like it? It's just I've never seen you in a dress before. And without your hat. Well, that says a lot. What do you want me to say? That maybe I look as pretty as that girl that you were dancing with. Better. Where is this coming from? Nevermind. When did you start caring about the girls you see me with? Nevermind. Forget I said anything. Go enjoy your party. Bella! Bella! Uncle Danny I'm home. Uncle Danny? Uncle Danny! Oh my god are you okay? What happened? Hey Bell. No, no, no no no no. Shh, shh, no cops. You are hurt. You need an ambulance. No, no I'm not. I can't. I gotta get help. No, no. Hello. Cliff. Yeah. Uncle Danny's hurt. He's on the ground. He's at our house, somebody attacked him. What? He's on the ground. Who did this? I don't know who did it. Alright, alright, just relax. I'll be right over. I'll be right over. Okay, come quick. I'll be here. Bruno, we have a situation. I need you to pick me up, drop me off at Bella's and then head over to Juanito's. And make sure that they know that Danny's debt is canceled. Yeah. Yeah, this generation needs to learn some respect. Son of a. - Hey. - Hey. So, how is he? They really beat him badly. Mr. Cliff's upstairs with him. Bella I'm so sorry. Is there anything I can do? No. I just feel really bad by the way I've been treating Uncle Danny lately. I said a lotta things I didn't mean. I'm sure he understands. He loves you too much. Besides you can't feel bad for what he gets himself involved in. I guess. So, how was the party? It would've been better if you stayed. Bell, are we okay? Yeah, no worries. I was just having a moment. Bell? Are we good? Yes. Do you want something to drink? No. Why are you weirding out on me? I don't know. I just feel like things are falling apart. I guess I don't want you to leave me. I'm not gonna leave you. I'm a phone call and a 10 hour drive away. Things are getting dangerous here. I just wanna go. They could've killed my uncle tonight. It's gonna be okay. Now listen, it's okay. I need you to go pick up that package on 18th Street. Go get that. Where do you think you're going? How much does Danny owe you? How much? Nothing. Please, make me come back. Mrs. Mackie. Hey Bella, I'm just checking in. I haven't heard from you in a couple of days. Everything alright? I'm sorry, I've been taking care of my uncle. He was in an accident. Oh wow, I'm sorry to hear that. Is he okay? Yes ma'am, he's doing better. Okay well you still wanna come to school this next semester, right? Yes, I filled out most of the paperwork. Have I missed the deadline? Oh no you have a week to get those forms to me. Well I'll be in today. Great, see you soon. Are you going to be okay Uncle Danny? Where you going? Gotta meet with Mrs. Mackie today. Okay, good. Don't you worry about me. See you after work. I'll see ya. You be safe, okay? Oh my gosh. Give me water. I just ran all the way here from the bus station. You forgot I was leaving today. No way. Tell me the truth and I'll give you life. Cruel, cruel beast. I'm a terrible friend. Actually the lady I told you about that's helping me get into school, she called me this morning to finish up my paperwork. I rushed out of the house and I forgot I was supposed to be here to see you off. Sorry. Truly a terrible friend. Hey, I ran all the way here from the bus station. This has got to count for something. What do you want, a medal? I deserve something. How about an interview? So Chad, tell me, how does it feel to leave the home for the first time in your wonderful life? Well, I feel so bubbly I might explode! The world awaits you sir. I wish you the best. You promise you won't forget me? Never silly. I'll call you on the way there and we're definitely hanging out for Thanksgiving. Okay? Later. Ugh, I know. It's so much to fill out. Yeah, I've signed my name over 100 times. Oh, it's time for my lunch. Wanna join me? No, but thanks. I can eat later. I won't take no for an answer. Come on. Let's go. So journalism, huh? Yeah. When I was a little girl I loved film noir. My favorite was Behind Green Lights. My mother used to love those films. Really? I don't meet too many people that like film noir. My favorite parts were when the press always got the first information, then the detectives, they would corner the murderer. Which most of the time beautiful women. Look at you, you're such an interesting film buff. Are you sure you don't wanna be a film maker? I bet you'd be a good one. No, I like being in the time, smack in the middle of it when all of the action goes down. Up close and personal. Where you going? I have to get to work. Do you know how to get to the bus from here? Oh I can take you. No, that's okay. Thanks for lunch. Hey Deanna. Ready to sing a song for me? I need one. What's wrong? They treat me so bad. But I keep coming back looking for you. I'm so sorry. I'll talk to them. Oh wow, I forgot your sandwich too. Don't worry about it baby.

What's wrong? Is Kim okay? Sir, we cannot discuss this over the phone. Can you please just tell me what's going on? - Sir. - Okay, I'm on my way. Cliff. Mrs. Mackie? Where is he? Why didn't you tell me? It was all in due time. I guess the time has come. But why would you do this to me now? Look, it's time for you make right and pay your past debts. I can't do this. Wait a minute, wait a minute. Is that Kim? That looks like her. What is she doing all by herself? I don't know, let's find out. That's crazy man, at this hour. There she is, there she is. I think that she wanted to, she disappeared. Think she went into that alley? Yeah. I'll check it. I swear to god, I swear to god if you scream I'm gonna kill you.

You promise you won't judge me? Of course not, I'd never do that. Do you promise? Of course not, I'd never do that. - You promise. - I promise! Okay. When I was 19 I was at a party with Danny. And he got caught up in a poker game. And he didn't wanna leave and I was tired so I left without him. And this man pulled me into an alley. And he put a knife in my throat and he. Oh, oh my god, no you don't have to say another word. No no, you don't understand. There's more. I got pregnant. I thought about an abortion but I couldn't go through with it. So I had her. And I gave her away. You had a little girl? Yes. Oh my god. And I think I've been meeting with her. What do you mean? You know the girl that I told you about, the one I've been helping? Oh my god. You mean... Yes. I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do. Okay, okay. Look, I know you know I am here for you, okay? Whatever you need is golden. But maybe you can give that little girl a chance. No. No, she's better off not knowing. Okay, okay, okay. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Yeah. That's it, that's all I'm gonna say about it. Director Mackie's office. How may I help you? Hi Shari, this is Bella Collins again. I was wondering if Mrs. Mackie has come in yet. I'm sorry Bella, she's in a meeting. Well I've left several messages and she hasn't called back yet. I'm sorry. I can transfer you to her voicemail. She'll be back with you as soon as she can. Okay, thanks. Okay, please hold.

Breakfast is ready. Bella! Stop yelling, I'm right here. Come on, I don't like cold pancakes. Sit down, let's eat. What, no interview? Hey, we're doing a story on Danny's Bistro and cuisines. And we have some very satisfyied customers here who'd like to share their experience with you. Ma'am, what do you think of la pancake a la carte? There seems to be some sort of problem. Is everything okay? No, nothing. Okay. Is everything working out with that break you caught at school? I don't know. That lady never returns my calls. The deadline's tomorrow. Oh yeah. Okay look, you just eat up. Everything's gonna work out just fine. How can you be so sure? You just eat your la pancake a la carte. I'll figure out the rest. Go on, eat up. Come on, come on. Yes Shari, I'll hold. Hey Bella, anybody available? Tony in about five minutes. Okay cool. Can I help you? Yeah I know you're pretty busy, but do you think you could fit us in today? Yeah, sure. And if you don't mind, while we're waiting, she has to go to the bathroom. Could you take her? - Hello princess. - Alright sweetheart. Are you leaving soon? Yeah I have that flight to Illinois. I haven't even packed yet. Bella Collins is holding on line three. I'll call her back. You can say all the junk you want about that pound for pound but if Mayweather got in the ring with Muhammad Ali, he'd get every pound of that butt whooped. Man it's all about the money too man. - Yeah. - Hey. It's gonna take money to pay the doctor bill. That's what it would do. Numbers don't lie. 49 and oh. Yeah that's 'cause Ali wasn't in there. Hey Bella, you okay? What's wrong with you? You alright? I'm sorry, what do you need? I'm about to go on my break. Check my 3:00. My 3:00 cancel? No, I need to leave for a little bit. Will you cover the front for me? I'll tell Cliff. Yeah, no problem sweetie. Go ahead. Think he's out back. Bella been acting weird today. Yeah, don't worry about Bella. You need to worry about Mayweather. But listen don't get it wrong, I like Mayweather too now. You would never bet your money against Ali. It's not a bad weird anyways. Next. What's the name? Sweetie, I need your name. Are you okay? You're missing your tax forms, your provisional certificate. Next. So we have a 211, Clifford Bianco, discovered around 7:00 o'clock? It was closer to 8:00 o'clock. And was it just you? No there were other people in the building. But nobody that I don't trust. Nobody you don't trust. Okay, okay. So it was around 8:00 o'clock, okay. So you trust everybody. No, I trust everybody who was in the building at that time. Okay so what exactly happened? Well we were in here with some money and it was always where it's always been and all of a sudden when I came back around 8:00 o'clock it wasn't there anymore. Where is she? Is Bella here? No, she's at work. If you wanna talk to her she'll be back soon. No, I don't wanna talk to her Danny. I never even wanted to meet her. Why couldn't you just leave things the way that they were? What was I supposed to do? Oh you wanna play rescue now? - What's that mean? - Are you a big hero? This is just like you. What? It's just like you. You know what I'm talking about. But it wasn't my fault. You can't keep blaming me for this. Well I do. I blame you. Who left me for a poker game? Look, it was your first party. Nobody told you... If you had just walked me home that night... To leave. I never would've been raped. Kim, I'm sorry. I'm sorry this ever happened to you. I've been trying to make it up to you ever since. Well you can't. Well I thought the least I could do... The least you could do is stay out of my life. And leave the past in the past. And what about Bella? What about her? Ah Kim. Come on. Kim! Kim come on. I don't understand. You can come to me for anything. I know Cliff. I wasn't thinking. I'm so sorry. Come here. It's okay, I forgive you. Don't let it happen again. Okay? Remember, a thief and his money will soon be parted. That's scripture. I believe it's a fool and his money. I believe that's what I said. Wait, I didn't know you went to church. How do you know scripture? Ah, I wasn't a scoundrel my whole life. My mom put some good things in me. Sounds like she was a good mother. I wish I knew mine. She's the one missing out baby girl. It's late, you should go. I'll have Bruno give you a ride, okay? - Okay. - Okay. Hey, it's you again. Danny, your money's no good here anymore. What are you talking about it's no good? It's green like everybody else's, right? My money's good anywhere. Go home Danny. My order's not to let you in another poker game in this town, okay? I guess you're right. I'll just play one round and then we'll... Danny, go home. Have a good night buddy, okay? Come on Uncle Danny, pick up. We both know where he went. But he won't be out late tonight. He won't be gambling for a while. I just wish he'd stop gambling. He has debt all over this city. Bruno, do you like living here? I've lived here my whole life, for better of for worse. This is where I stay. Don't you have any family? Nah, Mr. Cliff is my only family. And if there's one thing you need to know about family, we never steal from each other. You got that? Yes Bruno. I got it. Mr. Bruno, one day we'll see more of the world. There is so much out there that we haven't experienced. Here you go Bella. Tell Cliff I say thanks for today. Will do. Bruno. Get over here. I'm at the shop. No, get over here right now. Okay. Here, have a seat. So, why are you here? It's so funny, I, I used to live in this neighborhood. I used to love it here. All my friends were here and we had all these dreams of changing the world. I do too. Getting into school was my chance. I've been calling you for the past couple of days about my paperwork. The deadline was yesterday. That was my chance. Oh Bella, I'm, let's see, there's something I have to tell you. What? I had no idea who you were a week ago. And when Clifford called me, he described you as a teenage girl that he thought of as like his own daughter. So of course I didn't hesitate when he asked for my help. Because he saved my life years ago. What do you mean? I was at a party and I left the party by myself and something happened to me. Good morning, I'm Detective Pollack. Are you the owner of this house? No, I'm not. Are you Bella Collins? Yes. We're investigating the murder of Clifford Bianco. What? You mind if I come in ma'am, for a second? Bella! Uncle Danny! Uncle Danny! Uncle Danny. Uncle Danny. Uncle Danny! How are you? Thank you very much Mr. Collins. And as soon as you hear or remember anything gimme a call. Also, I'm gonna need a statement from Bella. She was the last one with the victim before he died and well other than Bruno Mercer. So at this point, she's my only possible lead. I understand. If you just give her a minute, I'll bring her down and she'll give her statement. It's all my fault. If I hadn't have stolen Cliff's money he wouldn't have been there so late. And Bruno would've been there and he would still be alive. Bella you don't know that. And this is not your fault. Who's to say, Bruno might not even be alive if you hadn't left when you did. Cliff is dead because of me. I've really messed up. I have to get out of here. It's okay Bella. It's okay. She couldn't answer any. I know who did it. I gotta get us outta this neighborhood. What, you know? How? They came to collect the debt I owed. Cliff tried to settle it. This was retaliation. You gotta call the police. If you know who did this, why wouldn't they just come back? You could be in danger, she could be in danger. I mean come on. I know. I know. I'll handle it. I really don't understand why you wouldn't just pack up and leave. Like you? Yeah, like me. It's not always so easy. Not everyone has a place to run to. Yeah that's an excuse Danny. Come on, you could get outta here if you really wanted to. You should get her outta here. Right, so you do care. Are you gonna tell her? I really don't wanna deal with this. I gotta go. Bell! What? Something came for you? What is it? Open it up. Oh you did it girl. You did it. I'm so proud of you. Here, I have something else for you too. Dearest Bella. I hope this letter will answer some of your questions. I apologize if I frightened you on my last visit, but I was trying to find the right words. For years I ran from the pain of being attacked. I thought my life was over. As a result I became pregnant. It was Cliff that talked me into keeping the pregnancy. I knew my parents didn't believe in abortions, so I didn't do it. Every time I felt the baby move in my belly, I was reminded of that night. I detached myself from the pregnancy, convincing myself I was carrying it for someone else. I wanted nothing to do with that night. I blamed my boyfriend for it happening to me. I left. I left him, Cliff, everything from that time, and yes, even you. I didn't think I could love you, but now I know I was wrong. To see you Bella, makes my heart so glad that I didn't make the mistake of denying you such a precious life. I don't expect you to understand my decisions, but I do wanna be a part of your life, if you allow me. It may take you awhile to forgive me. I can only hope that one day you will find it in your heart to let me be a part of your life. I am so sorry for the pain I must've caused you all these years. With love, Kim. Hi. Hi, I'm Bella. I'm Marco, Kim's husband. Please, come on in. Kim! Nice house. Thank you. Please have a seat. Would you like some water? I'm good. I get lost in that one too. So does this mean that you got my letter? Yeah. The ever so timeless Bella, covered under the umbrella of love, her shadows of emptiness creates troubled memories causing her to push herself out of misery. She didn't know that was there. She knew of the great clouds that stood still in the hope of the sky in her life to turn blue. She knew that life in her would breathe if she would just believe, forgive the things in her life that she cannot see, 'cause the offspring of her presence became a blessing to open wounds, healed by harmonious, heavenly tunes that comforts her spirit like the moon. Embrace the tales of fruition that slowly dwindles in the corner of her intuition, the people who loved her most didn't know what they were missing. And the ones who did were grateful that they met her, the young, beautiful Bella. Subtitles by explosiveskull
