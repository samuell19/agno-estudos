How's my baby? What? Do you want more? Here. That's good. That's it. Very good. You're so cute You're so cute It's so cold Quack, quack, quack. Quack, quack, quack. Look. Very good. Hello, honey. Mom is taking a shower. Hi, Liz, hi, Nica. How are you? This is dad. Da-ddy. Hello, Liz, I was tidying the desk and I found a very nice quote from Nicanor Parra. I'll read it to you. "Perhaps, one day, we will all come together and firmly stand together like hens defending their chicks." What I need is someone to give me a hand. I'm a little overwhelmed. I moved recently... There, there. Perhaps someone who can help with house chores who can help me organize my day My husband travels a lot. That's... How many kids do you have? Three are already grown-ups, and the youngest is turning 16. So, you understandwhat I'm talking about. Yes, the youngest was unexpected. Honestly, I didn't want any more, but I had a steady job at a lady's home, I had everything set up and she came. Are you married? Yes. But my husband passed away. Yes. He was a railway worker and had an accident. Let me hold him a minute, see if I can calm him down. - How difficult for you. - How cute. Yes. Anyway, my three eldest are from another man. I didn't marry him, because he hadn't divorced. - Oh. - Yes. Anyway, we separated. He travels a lot, doesn't live here, and he saw other women... He would walk by my house with these other women So I asked him to leave and he was okay with it. And I complain with just one kid. You're complaining for the sake of it. Hold him for a minute,I'll make some tea. Yes, go ahead. I think we'll manage just fine. Also, you don't have your mom and you look pretty lonely. He's weighing... Look, he's at 15 pounds and 7 ounces. - That's good, right? - Very good. Now, let's see 16 inches. Look. He instantly looks at you, his mom. - Hi, honey. - Look. If I am worried, does he notice? Look, what's important is thebond you create with him. You can see this in even the most disadvantaged of families, those that are limited and can'texercise their most basic rights that if the mother plays with her child, talks to him, supports him, is available for him, that child is protected. Sure. It is also good for him to interact with other people. You told me you go to the park, you are with other moms. That's a nice time for him, because he's outside, under the sun. - For you. - Despite the cold? Yes. otherwise, children in Patagonia wouldn't go out. The shovel, the shovel - lifts everything... - Hi. Hi. Do you need some help? I'll try. I'll try and see if he likes it. But I think he doesn't. - Don't be upset. - Is it the first time? Yes, I tried some other time, but... Don't be upset. What's her name? Clarisa. "She sees everything." What a nice name. - And him? - Nicanor. Do you breastfeed her? No. My sister did. Our mom passed away a year ago, and it was very sad. And she didn't have anymore milk. and then we started with the bottle. But look at her, she grows just the same. My mom passed away about a year ago, too. I was pregnant. Do you have a partner? Yes. Yes, but he's in Chile, working. So we manage by ourselves. Do you have a car? Yes. Why? I have a theory. A single mom needs a car. But I'm not single. Well, I mean, with your husband being away Single mom, husband away. Would you come with me to the seesaw? The doctor told me it's good for them to try different sensations. It goes up and down, so... go up. Down, down, down. go up. That's it. Down. I think they're good, right? Okay. Yes, it's getting a little cold. Liz, let's eat something. But it's 11:00 am, do you want to eat now? Why not? I must confess I like the idea of having a beer now. Of course. After that, you're soothed all day. Once, I spent a whole month drinking beer. With a boyfriend I had. In Mar del Plata. I had a boyfriend in Mar del Plata, too. - No. - Yes. I'm so rude. I didn't ask youif you like onions. I do. In fact, my husband is crazy about onions. And what's he doing? He's making a documentary in a volcano. And he left you the car. - Yes. - Okay. How many people does it fit? - I don't know, four, five. - Regular. - Yes, like any car. Why? - Okay. No, because my sister is not fine and I want to help her and... Anyway, you look like you're an awful driver. - Why? - Yes, like you go like this. No, you're wrong.I'm not a bad driver. Then some time I'm goingto ask you a favor with the car. - I'm going to the toilet fora sec.- Okay. What? No, it's okay. Leave the stroller. No, it's okay. As you wish. Occupied. What do you do, Liz? I work in a publishing house and I write, too. Sometimes, some things. And you? great. I work at a factory and I bake stuffed bread on the side. I sell them. Can I read what you wrote? Sure. I'll give it to you later. I wrote a novel. - Okay. - Yes. And what are you doing now, a novel about motherhood? No. That's not something thatappeals to many. Cheers. I think he's a little tired. Let's do this. I've eaten and drunk enough. I'll give you money. Okay? Liz, I think we can help each other. I have a proposition, because my sister... Wait. Let's arrange to meetanother day, because if he doesn't get his sleep, he gets fussy. Okay. Let's see. What are you doing? Are you leaving, too? Keep putting on your coat. You're leaving, why would I stay? - Yes, but don't rush. - Don't stay still. Come on, walk. What are you doing? Go. Go. Come on Liz. Wait! You turn and I keep going. Hi, Liz. Hi, Nica. How are you? We are now moving from a location to another. We've just finished this part, we haven't reached the volcano yet. Answering your question, honey, the volcano is inactive, so you can relax. The lava is quiet. Nica, I miss you a lot. I know you don't understand, but look. If he laughs, tell me, Liz. Tell me how you're doing,send me things, I miss you guys. Everything here is fine,I'm happy... - Liz! You're a mom! - Hi, Nati. How amazing! How cool you brought him! Hello! - Who does he take after? - How are you? - Liz Caridi, you're here. - Hi, Adolfo. - How are you? - Fine. All these can't match up to you. You're ruining us withyour absence. No, I don't think so. They're great. Thanks for standing up for us. It was a joke, Luciano, don't be so sensitive. - We're getting organized. - There's a lot of things? Yes, and I'm doingthe play, too. You've got to come see my play. Yes. You wrote it, right? Yes. The music and the text. - So... - That's great. - So? - Great. Fine. You? Fine, I'm fine. But I haven't had a child, so I don't have much news. Tell me about you. I don't know. There's so much I don't know how to tell it. I'd call it Nicanor. And breastfeeding, how's it going? No, I couldn't do it. I didn't have any milk,so I'm bottle feeding him. I didn't know. Then it's perfect, with the bottle. No, Lucho, it's not perfect. It's not perfect. It's not fine. - Why? - Because in general... Did Mara breastfeed? Yes, Mara was breastfeeding all the time. Hey, don't. Don't worry. I'm so ashamed, I swear. The first thing you have to do is to take your kids out of your bed. Yes, of course. Talk? Of course. - Yes, not talking, I mean... - I have no choice. "How are you? How do you feel?" A caress, you know? Sometimes we're fighting all day and I don't feel like going and touching his leg to start something. - It's too much. - Why, is it forced? Yes, you're fighting all day and then, what do you do by night? Make up? It's hard. We've got two children. It's not work, but we've got twochildren, how do you do it? A certain day, at a certain time. The thing about frequency is that it goes beyond just how often you do it. I think the connection is important. Agus and I have a sexual connection that really pierces me as a woman. I never felt that, and having that is great. Having it is unique, and you have to value it. I mean, doing it for the sake of it is weird, too. I mean, it's cool, but it's weird. Sometimes it's nicebeing surprised. - Yes, if you can do it. - Bye. - Bye. - See you. But it's also nice to connect with a dinner. - Hi, Rosa. - Hi. What an idea, leaving without paying. Look. I brought you the cup. - I took it. - Thank you. I think you took my money. Maybe, I don't know. I don't have anything here. I'll pay you later. Yes, it's okay. Is anything wrong? Clari? She's with my sister. Renata. She was supposed to be here an hour ago. I don't know where she is. There's a lot of traffic. No, there isn't much traffic. And it's pretty cold, too. - Do you want one? - Okay. - Do I light it for you? Can you? - Yes. You see her? That's "One Subject." Once she accused me of stealing a bucket. - Buckets are all the same. - Really. When I was a child, I went on holiday with my parents to Brazil. There were a lot of people. And I was holding my mom's hand, and I let her go to look for something, a lot of people got in the middle, and I lost sight of her. - In another country. - Yes. I lost sight of her. And I started walking to the other side. Did they leave? No, they didn't see me and I started walking towards the other side. - Awful. - Yes. Horrible. Did you get lost some time? No, I didn't get lost, but I remember one time, we had to take a train, my mom always complained that she got Renata and I ready and we were never ready. And I remember the train was about to leave, and my dad got on and my mom got on and we were joking, Renata and I joked all the time, and the train left. My name is Liz. Any information you may have is very important for us. I live nearby, so you call us, we're here two blocks away. - Perfect. I'll let you know. - Thank you very much. Remember, the woman is called Renata and the baby, Clarisa. Tell him what Renata looks like so he recognizes her. Renata is tall, slim, straight hair. And the baby is a baby, with the stroller. - Fine. I'll let you know. - Thank you very much. Bye. It's here. The good thing is we're really close to the park, so we can go quickly. I'll put Nicanor to sleep. Do you like tea? Yes. I have some flavored ones. They're delicious. Excuse me. Can I go to the toilet? Yes. It's there. I'll make some spaghetti now and you'll see what a bad cook I am. Liz? My sister, Renata fell in love with a guy from the chat. He's called Mauro. They started chatting in a forum. Then they switched to Skype. Now, about nine months ago or a year, she lives in another world. And she doesn't even have a job, but at least she's better. I don't know. Sometimes she laughs. That's why I tell you. She doesn't know the guy. But you know? I swear... if she comes back, and everything's fine... I want to take her to meet him. - Where does he live? - In Saladillo. Do you dare drive 116 miles? I've never driven on the highway. Well, but I'm a good copilot. I know about maps. I don't have an extra car seat. That's no problem. It is a problem. It is a big problem. I was thinking... maybe Renata can come here, help me with something... Yes, maybe. I can't send her by bus like this. Also, Mauro, that boyfriend, I don't know him. I have to meet him, find out what his job is. And Clarisa, she has to see the place. - Yes. - Do you understand me? Of course. I understand you. The thing is that I need to get organized. Of course, I understand you. And you haven't met Renata. If you've met her, you wouldn't hesitate to help me. Let me think about it. There's the issue of the extra car seat... - On my lap. - No. It's forbidden, it's a law. Children have to go in a car seat. I have one for Nicanor, but not for Clarisa. And you don't know anyone who has a car seat? Because I don't. Lucho might have. A friend.He has two kids. - No, I'll call him later. - Call him. It's just a minute. - I'll call him later. - Call him, why not? We go before your husband comes back. And we come back. It's just 116 miles. Hi, Lucho, it's Liz. How are you? I'm calling you from another phone. I wanted to ask you something out of the blue. Do you happen to have an extra car seat? It's ringing. - Maybe Santi's or Serena's? - It says Gustavo. We talk later. Kisses. Bye. Yes. How are you, honey? Hi, honey. How are you? Can I talk to you some other time? Right now I'm having dinner with a friend. I can't hear you, there's... We're chaining the car because... Look. No, I'll go to the kitchen. Don't worry, I'll go. Look, I'll put the headphones on, so we can talk better. What's that? Is Nicanor crying? go, go. - Look, eyes wide open. - Wait. - No, Rosa. - Hi, mom. I don't take him out of the darkness,I don't want him to wake up. Or he'll sleep really late. So what if he doesn't sleep?He doesn't have to work. - Hi, how are you? - And you are? I'm Liz's friend, she's sleeping the baby now. She'll be right back. Honey, Nicanor just woke up. - This is Rosa. - How are you? How are you over there? Fine, fine. Sven is happy, because it's much more bleak. It's a woman with a baby girl. I've already given you the phone number. Thank you very much. Rosa is in the bathroom. Hello? Yes, she'll be down in a minute. Rosa! - What's up? - Hurry, hurry. - What happened? Hurry what? - Here. What happened is what I ask you, Rosa. Who is she? What are you doing here? She's Liz. She's a friend who helped us. Are you crazy? Why didn't you go home? Why didn't you go to David's? Do you want her to catch bronchiolitis gain? Shut up. Don't you see you're the one who's wrong? The cell phone's battery died, Rosa. Stop making things up. To get your way, I know you. All night. Why don't you think about her? Wait a minute, Rosa. If you start again with the time I left Clarisa alone, you can go to hell! First, shut up. And then get on the taxi. And then we'll talk, because what you put me through is unforgivable. get in the taxi. - It's over. - Get in the taxi! - I have no money. - I don't have a cent. Why do you take a taxi? Do you want me to walk everywhere looking for you? Rosa, I have money. Come on, get in. Thank you. I'll pay you back later andyou can give me your answer on what I’ve asked. - Yes. Okay. - Yes? How's my baby? Did he sleep well? Yes. So-so. Liz, do you smoke? No. Did you sleep on the couch? Yes. Yes. What's up, honey? One, two, three, four. - Liz! - Hi, Cora. - How are you? - Fine, very well. - Fine? - Fine. - What are you doing? - Nothing, just going that way. - I'll go with you. - Okay. How's Nicanor? Fine, here he is. What a cold day, isn't it? My mom told me to go to the mall, because she's always telling me what I should and shouldn't do... I'm fed up. I didn't want to go to the mall. It's noisy, the shops, the music. - Yes. - It's all consumerism. I hate consumerism. What do they want to buy? - What do they want to buy? - Yes. - And look at the day. - He likes outdoors better, too. He gets fussy in malls. He doesn't like them. Look at the day. I hate to say my mom is right. I hate to be here and say I'll go home. - Really, right? - Yes. Hey, some moms are having like a parenting meeting. Twice a week, two hours. We'll rotate houses. Yes. Children will have fun, don't you think? And we can talk about parenting issues. One day we talk about fears. Another day, about anxieties. Another, about doubts. - I don't know, different issues. - Oh, maybe. And we share what we feel. - Is there anywhere to share this? - No. There are no magic recipes. No, right. Maybe I'll go, yeah. Because... The other day I saw you... That you were talking to the R sisters. The R sisters? Rosa and Renata. I saw you talking to Rosa. Oh, Rosa, yes. They are some characters. - They're not like you and me. - Why? Has she asked you for your car? I don't know, Cora, what do you mean? I'll get going, because, look, he just got up. It's getting cold and he's really fussy. I'll get going. - I'll give you a hand. - Then he gets worked up. I'll help you. Take him, calm him down. It's okay. Calm him down, I'll get the stroller up. - Thank you.- Poor thing. Go with mommy. I have two kids. - I know. - Thank you. No, we have to help each other. She's "One Subject". I want to know how you're doing. Renata? Fine. Renata wants to thank you. No, tell her she doesn't have to. She wants to go for a walk to a beautiful place. Full of trees. The three of us. - How much fun. - Yes, it'll be nice. Okay, I'd love to. - Ok. great! - Tell her I love the idea. - I tell you, too, I love the idea. - She's with me, I'll tell her. Ok. We'll talk later to planwhen to meet up. I don't know what to do with Nica. Don't cry, honey. Okay. My number is on the fridge. Just in case. I just gave him the bottle. So, if you can, don't feed him. Since I don't breastfeed him and he's so little. - Don't worry. I have your number. - So I feed him. I've looked after children since I was 12. Don't worry. For me, luckily, all the smell thing stopped after the delivery. Some women have that, like before and after delivery. The delivery, the delivery. Rosa, did you have a natural birth or c-section? What? What kind of delivery did you have? Did you tell her Clarisa was yours? No, silly, I didn't have a delivery. What...? I don't know what to say. I didn't say that. - I gave birth to Clarisa. - Ah. Right. No, no. Right. I don't know what I thought, what association I made. Actually, when you said, "My sister breastfeeds her..." It sounded weird. My sister. Rosa, Aunt Rosa. - Aunt Rosa. - Right. You know, from now on, I'm Aunt Rosa. I love this coat, you know? I wanted to tell you from the first moment. - I love it. - Yes, it's nice. - Very nice. - Yes, yours is nice, too. Let's switch. Let's switch. - No. - Yes, yes. This is a light coat. A light coat? Look. I'll give it to you for a week. You think about what I've asked. And when we switch back coats, you give me your answer. - About taking you to Saladillo? - Yes. I'll ask my husband today about the car. - The oil... - Look at here with the coat. The air. Hello. Hi, Yazmina. Hi, Liz. Hi. Hi, baby. You had your milk. Did he have his milk? Yes, I gave him. He was crying and I thought it was the time. Then he fell asleep. It's fine. But you know I told you about breastfeeding and bonding? The doctor told me. Babies sometimes cry. For some other reason, not because they're hungry. If I can't, I can't. If it's possible, it's best if I feed him, but... I'll wait for you. I'll wait for you every time. But if I have to, I'll feed him. Because he can't suffer, he doesn't understand his mom isn't here. He's hungry and that's it. - Okay? - Yes. Bottle Bottle Hello, daughter. I'll bother you with another quote from Nicanor Parra, my grandson's namesake. "I really want to yell, Long live Andes mountains!" I thought it was nice. Hello, friend, this is Lucho. Will you come to see my play? How are you, Liz? My coat, did Rosa give it to you? Just for today. Look, this bag is full of food Rosa cooked for you. There's some stew. In this orange Tupperware there's chicken stew. It must be great. Rosa told me to get in the house with you. That you need help. And you know something? I'm an ace in deep cleaning. No, Renata, really, it's not necessary. There we go. Look at the dirt between the sheets. When will you finish? Because he's about to fall asleep. You look very tired. You don't know how great Saladillo is, Liz. gorgeous. I've never been. But my boyfriend sent me pictures. Just looking at them you smell nature. It's incredible. Food must be amazing. Local products. How nice. Clari will like her new home, then. Clari won't stay. No, you leave me there and then you come back. I misunderstood. I'll go change him. Can I use Skype? I'm serious, don't laugh. How are you going to keep me warm? - You? - Yes. - Heating. - And what heating? - Firewood. - Firewood? Yes, do you like firewood? - I love it. - Great. And listen, did you arrange where we're going to sleep? - Yes, yes. - Is it ready? - Yes, it's ready. - And how is it? Fine. I put some blankets. And I swept the floor, so it's clean, so you don't get any allergies or anything. You're crazy. No, I'm serious. Everything's real nice. I did it for you. Really. You know? I'm about to finish. I'm finishing up here. Let's do this. In ten minutes I'll be on the bus on my way home. And then you can call me and we continue talking. Okay, okay. And we can talk. - Okay. - Great. I call you. Renata? Nicanor fell asleep, you did a lot... - I can cook myself. - Okay. Okay. I hope you've had the chance to get to know me and you can see I am a good person. - Yes. - Don't worry. We have organized everything. Okay? It's very late. I give you 100 pesos. Okay. We'll see which sister keeps this money, your friend Rosa or me. My coat? I prefer you arrange that with her. You know what I wanted to ask you, Liz? Could you give me something in advance, 100 for next time? No. Look, Renata, there's been a misunderstanding. I'm sorry. I don't need someone to help me. I already have someone who helps me. I can manage by myself. That you are by yourself, I can tell. But that you can manage, not at all. Hi, it's Rosa, leave your message. Hi, Rosa, it's Liz. Renata just left my home. I just went through a horrible situation. I don't know if she's having another episode. I need to talk to you. Please call me. Hi, it's Cora. I can't answer. Leave your message and have a nice day. Hi, Cora, it's Liz. How are you? I was thinking the day is nice. - Sebas! - Bruno, take your coat off! - What? - Come! So you can draw your own conclusions. What's up? Tell Liz about the R sisters, with Rosa. -About what? -About the car. She stole it. She stole my car. Suppose I left the keys here. I came and it wasn't here. I tell them, "My car was stolen." We went to the police, filed a report. I reported it to the insurance. Stress, anxiety. - Terrible. - He was desperate. Two days later, Rosa shows up at home with the keys and she tells me, "I took your car." She went to Mar del Plata. She drove 300 miles with my car. - She hadn't asked for it? - No, of course not. She had never asked for the car. At least make everything clear. Can you wait for me there for a minute, please? She shouldn't lend her the car, she'll steal it. At least, I don't know, she knows. - She's around here. - I think this is serious. She's here, selling. She's working here. - Well. - So I'll go ask her. - We'll go with you. - We'll go with you. I think the best is to go with you. We come here all the time. Hello, Rosa. I need you to tell me... about a situation that happened some time ago with Sebas' car. Yes, specifically, the car. But that's... What are you talking about? I don't understand. Since that happened with my car, and now we heard you were asking her... - But what...? - Just to know. But that's over. We want to get everything clear. You want to borrow my car, they tell me this, I need to know. I want to hear your side. - She doesn't want to worry. - What's going on? Nothing happened. At that time,I had an urgent situation, so I took his car, that's true, and I took it to Mar del Plata for two days. I apologized and he accepted. And now, now that's over. I asked for your car, and you can say no. She wanted to know, so she's cool. We cleared the air, we heard each other. - That's it. - I think that's it. For me, that's it. - Okay. - Let's go. Bye. Let's see. Is everything okay with your cousin? Yes, perfect. He doesn't bother anymore, thank you. Perfect. You're talking like you're superior. No, I'm not superior, but I do have more information. - That's true. - I don't care, I don't agree. This is a meeting. We can talk, but there are children here. I don't like my child listening to this. I don't like my child at the park listening to gross things. - If there's more freedom... - Gays are freer. I don't care. What did you say? Maybe you're more used to talking about that. In your gay world you talk more freely. - Here, we don't. - No doubt about that. No doubt about that. You know what? No doubt. - Not here. - Totally. - I'm not used to... - We don't pretend. It looks as if it's a subject... We don't pretend. That's my point. I think abortion is an issue that should be in all homes. - Yes, but it depends... - It's about support... - This isn't the time. - And it's about freedom. I'll move the vegetables up so they don't ruin so fast. You should choose a day to do the groceries. I tell you about the food, because you're so thin. And Nica, too. I like to clean it with alcohol. Alcohol is the best for these things. And also it's something that you don't clean so often. If you saw the marks... - Yazmina. - Yes? Look at this. What's that? Be very careful. This is a toy. It's not real. Anyway, it's impressive. It could scare someone away. I don't know, contents. The thing is the guy publishes. He was going back, and I got a meeting with him. He's taking a lot of books from writers from here. I don't know, if you're interested... Yes. I'm interested. - Yes? - Very much. You can come to that meeting with me. I'll arrange. Yes, great. - You can arrange, right? - Yes, it's work. great, then. - I'll arrange a meeting for the three.- Great. Let's go up, or it'll be very late. Stay in the audience while I go talk to the guys for a second. We watch the play and then we eat something. There's a vegetarian. How is Mara? Fine.Today she went out with her friends. She went to have dinner. And the kids? Yes, with her. They were all mothers. - But with the kids. - Yes, with the kids. They're older. Do you know what I remembered the other day? What? Oh, god. Do you remember that trip to Lima? That we did together? Yes. Why? Nothing. They'll check the sound now. Okay. I'll start tuning. Come. - Hi. - Hi. Is Nica sleeping? Yes, he fell asleep. I just gave him the bottle. No, Yazmina, I told you I'd give him the bottle. But he was hungry. My point is, that it's importantfor me to give him the bottle. Since I couldn't breastfeed, it's importantfor me to share that special moment with him. I apologize for speaking to you like this, but I really feel it's important... Gustavo told me to give him the bottle. I'll call him. Hi, Gustavo. It's Liz. Yazmina told me you told her, remotely, to give Nicanor the bottle. Honestly, I feel we don't have communication. It's no good for me. He's with the boxes, and do you know what makes me angry? Hi. How are you? Hello. I don't want to eat that any more. I'm fed up. He can do what ever he wants. Take it. See you, honey. I almost kissed you on the mouth. See you. I'll take the egg one. Bye. No matter how in love she is, and that she wants to start a new life in Saladillo... Clarisa won't be alone. Yes, you're like her mom, but you're not her mom. Okay, you understood everything. I don't know. And about this guy's car, Sebas, what's...? You owe me money you never gave me back. What money? - You owe me money, Rosa. - What money? 100 pesos? How much? No, more. How much? - It doesn't matter. - Tell me, how much? The taxi, 100 pesos I gave your sister... A coffee and what you gave my sister. 100 pesos. - No, but it doesn't matter. - Really, it doesn't matter. I think you don't care about that money. I don't know, it's weird, all of a sudden, the money. I don't know, there are many things I don't like. There are many things I don't like, either. For me, friendship is something different. We don't understand each other. We see some things very differently. That's why, it's impossible. You don't even know how you want to be as a mother. You don't have a motherly instinct. At least, you don't have it yet.You have everything to learn. You have everything to learn,you're not even a mom. You've crossed the line. It'll bevery hard to recover from this. - Hi, everyone. - Hi. Seba, I need to talk to Rosa. - Did something happen? - No, but I need to find her. - What happened? - She must be working.

One thing, if I want to use the fifth gear, in case I'm on the highway, is it to the side and upwards or is it with the lock and first? What lock? That's reverse. - I know that's reverse, Gustavo. - Look for the R for reverse. - But our car has a lever. - What lever? No, you have to go down, to the left, and upwards. But what is it for? What do you have to do? It's... Wait. Do you want to come? Liz? There we go. No, it's... - No, it's in case... - Hello, honey. - I'm asking just in case. - Hello. Just in case for what? For my friends from the park. - The one that was there the other day? - That one. What? You say "hmm". What? What? No, you're interpreting... I didn't say anything. - You're terrible, Gustavo. - What? Why? Honey, there are many things. I mean... You're away. I'm asking you to tell me about...Let's not argue in front of him. - I'm with Nica, a lot of things. - Of course. Why wouldn't you? They offered me an incredible invitation. It's something like,driving up to Saladillo so that she can meet someone very important to her. - What person? Tell me. - What's the matter? Tell me, what's the problem. You're far away. - What did I say? - And demanding explanations for everything What's the problem? - I don't want explanations. - How many times I took the car? - I'm working, you treat me as if... - I could be working, too. - But I... - I work, too. When you let me work. When I let you work? Liz. We're not understanding. Obviously. We're not understanding each other. - How are you? - Hi. I'm sorry I'm late, I had to ask to leave earlier. It's okay. Thank you. - Can you? - Yes. Hello. How are you? She's with me. - Yazmina. - No. Rosa, a friend. - Nice to meet you. - Hello. Nati, where can they wait while I have the meeting? I don't know. Inside it's too enclosed. - It's not suitable for babies. - Go to my office. - I have no problem. - No, it's okay. As you wish. - Bye. - They're waiting for you there. Bye, honey. Bye. - Hello. - How are you? How are you? Nice to meet you. Liz. - Nice to meet you, too. - Sorry for the delay. I've had a child recently, Nicanor, and the preparations plus something unexpected... What's important is Nicanor. - How are you, fine? - Fine, very well. Adolfo told me you're writing or you finished writing a novel. I told him. Yes. That's right. - Can we read it? - Sure. Great. We have an artist in the team. Very well. Tesouro is a creative consultant, he specializes in investigation and research in editorial marketing for news papers. He's looking for new content for the UPA market. UPA? It's the Union of Latin American Newspapers. It's a huge market. Very interesting. We do multimedia, collections, publications. As you told me you were willing and able to come back to work, how do you see setting up one, maybe two collections for Dario to taketo the market? Great. We're thinking a line of development I find particularly interesting that has to do with leaders. World leaders. I mean, Gandhi, Teresa of Calcutta, Mao, de Gaulle, Kennedy, Churchill, Castro, Che, Mandela. Basically, that's what we need. The idea is you start with this project now, and it should be delivered now. Ten days. - But it's ten days we'll be in touch. - Of course. It's important you feel supported during the process. Constantly. I think that's very important. Something else I'd like to know is if you're familiarized with the task of community manager. - I'm particularly interested in... - Excuse me. I have a little issue. I'm sorry. Rosa? Nati, did you see Rosa, the girl who was here with Nicanor? No idea. I was in a conference. - Do you want me to look for them? - No, no. Rosa! Rosa? Rosa! Nica! Rosa! Rosa! Have you seen a woman going out with a stroller? Oh, god. Say what you want. I'm telling you what happened, you do what you want. See you later. Bye. Where is my son? He's at the park with Renata. - What park? Tell me. - Liz. He's at the park with Renata. Do you want to see what I am capable of? Look. - What lake? - The lake where I sell. Oh, son. I don't know what happened to her. You didn't even call me. I'm sorry. She thought you weren't here She thought we had left. I'm out of breath. Uh, I close my eyes I close my eyes - Is she usually late? - I don't know. I never... There she is. - There you are. - Hi. How are you? Hi. What happened? Nothing, it took me a while to go out with Nicanor. That grey one. The car is great. Rosa always says a mom in the city needs a car. Yes. If she is by herself, she does. - I'm not by myself. - Well. So, Renata, you'll be on the passenger seat. - Okay, honey. - Okay. First of all, I want to tell you, we drink bottled water. Not from the tap. Unless it's connected... The green tap is the only one. I have to go there to get it? No, it's connected there, it's from the tank, but I do it, don't worry. And remember about the plugs. - What was that? - Don't plug anything. Don't plug anything? If you're not stepping on wood. Here. Look. Here. This is it. This side, not this one. Winter is hard, but still... - It's fine. - Why is it hard? Because it's colder here. It doesn't look like it, but it is. No, no. Is it friendly? It's going to fight. Come here. Clari. Hello. Look at my hand. There we go. You'll have to paint your nails blue. Change your face, Rosa. Change that face. Will you stay with me? Will you stay with me? To my dad.
