( birds chirping ) ( clock chimes ) Man: GO! ( cheering ) Man: COME ON! BLAST AND BUGGERATION. IMMIGRANT CHAPPY'S FAR TOO GOOD. I TOLD YOU, WE SHOULD NEVER HAVE ALLOWED JEWS INTO THE UNIVERSITY. OR THE COUNTRY. HMM. NOT BAD. CEDERS, FANCY A SNIFTER? WE SHOULD NEVER HAVE ALLOWED SHORTS. THEY SHOULD RUN AS GOD INTENDED: BARE-CHEEKED, STARK NAKED. BUTTOCKS ALL A TREMBLE. I HOPE YOU'LL BE MORE FUN WHEN YOU MEET MY SISTER. I SAID I HOPE YOU'LL BE MORE FUN WHEN YOU MEET MY SISTER. I SAID I'LL HOPE YOU'LL BE MORE FUN WHEN YOU MEET-- ( crowd grumbling ) OH, HELLO. YOU DAMN TOFF. EDWARD IVORY. HOW DO YOU DO? CEDRIC TRILLING, HUGH DAMN TOFF. NOT ONE OF THE HAMPSHIRE DAMN TOFFS BY ANY CHANCE? AS I WAS SAYING, I DO HOPE YOU'LL BE MORE FUN WHEN YOU MEET HER. SHE'S A CORKING PEACH. ( train whistle blows ) ( train whistle blows ) ( groans ) ( sighs ) WON'T DO. ( bicycle bells ringing ) ( squeaking ) ( humming ) ( horse whinnies ) - ( humming ) ( ship's horn blows ) ( humming ) ( groans ) ( exhales ) ( cow moos ) ( moos ) ( classical music playing ) ( gasping ) AH, HUDSON SENIOR. GOOD MAN. WHEN MATER AND PATER DIED, WE HAD HUNDREDS OF LETTERS FROM FUSSY, MIDDLE-AGED SPINSTER AUNTS. GOOD DAY TO YOU, MASTER EDWARD. UH, YOUR TICKET, PLEASE, SIR. THE AUNTS ALL WANTED TO BRING US UP TO BE ARROGANT, EMOTIONALLY STUNTED, AND COMPLETELY OUT OF TOUCH WITH THE REAL WORLD. BUT AUNT AGNES WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO WAS ACTUALLY RELATED. BEGGING YOUR PARDON, MASTER EDWARD, BUT YOU SHOULD ALSO HAVE A TICKET. I MUST INSIST. I DO SO HATE ORDINARY PEOPLE. YOU MUSTN'T HATE THEM. THEY HAVE SMALLER BRAINS. AH. - HUDSON? - ( bell tolls ) HUDSON! Edward: AWFUL SHAME ABOUT YOUR FATHER. STROKES ARE RARELY FATAL. I WONDER WHAT CEDRIC WILL BE LIKE. EDWARD SAID THAT HE'S MOST HANDSOME. IN WHICH CASE WE MUST MAKE A GOOD IMPRESSION. - RUTHIE? - YES, MA'AM? - YOU'RE FIRED. - YES, MA'AM. OH, AUNT AGNES, HOW COULD YOU? NOW WE HAVE NO ONE LEFT TO CLEAN THE HOUSE. IF YOU DON'T FIND A HUSBAND QUICKLY, YOU WILL SOON BE AN OLD MAID LIKE ME. BUT I'M ONLY 22. WHY EVER DID YOU TURN DOWN THAT PROPOSAL FROM THE VICAR? WHAT'S HIS NAME? MR. TWEEB? HIS EYEBROWS ARE OVER TWICE THE SOCIALLY ACCEPTABLE LEVEL OF BUSHINESS. THE MAN THAT I MARRY MUST BE PERFECT IN EVERY WAY. HMM. HMM. ( cracks ) WATCH OUT! UHH! - EDWARD, COULD YOU PLEASE SLOW DOWN? - WHY? EMILY, THIS IS MY VERY DEAR FRIEND MR. CEDRIC TRILLING. HOW CHARMING TO MEET YOU. AND THIS IS AUNT AGNES, OUR GUARDIAN, WITH THE WITHERING LOOK. I WAS JUST REMARKING HOW IMPORTANT IT IS FOR A YOUNG LADY TO BE MARRIED BY THE AGE OF 22. HASN'T THE WEATHER BEEN PLEASANT? MOST CERTAINLY. THE SKY THIS MORNING WAS EXACTLY AS THE POET HOMER DESCRIBED. "DAWNS OF ROSY-TIPPED FINGERS ILLUMINATING THE HEAVENS." HMM. AND WASN'T THE RAIN YESTERDAY DREADFUL? MOST CERTAINLY. IT WAS EXACTLY AS THE POET HOMER DESCRIBED. "THE SPARKLING DROPLETS FELL FROM THE SKY LIKE FRAGILE TEARS FROM THE SWOLLEN EYES OF THE DAUGHTER OF ZEUS." DAUGHTER OF ZEUS? I EXPECT SHE WAS MARRIED BEFORE SHE WAS 22, HMM? RIGHT, OLD FELLOW. SHOW YOU TO YOUR ROOM. WHY MUST YOU ALWAYS EMBARRASS ME? A LADY SHOULD NEVER DISCUSS THE WEATHER WITH A POTENTIAL HUSBAND. YOU OUGHT TO MAINTAIN AN AIR OF MYSTERY FOR THE WEDDING NIGHT. HURRY UP WITH THOSE, HUDSON! IT'S NEARLY TIME FOR TEA! AND, EMILY... DO TRY TO LOOK PRETTIER. WHAT'S UP, SON? SOME BLOODY FOOLS IN A MOTORCAR ALMOST KILLED ME! ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? COME SIT BY THE FIRE. I'LL PUT SOME NICE RAW VEGETABLES IN BOILING WATER FOR YOU. MMM. IDIOTS WERE HEADING FOR IVORY HALL. IVORY HALL? YOU HAVEN'T... DENTED THE ROLLS? OW! PEOPLE LIKE US ARE THE SCUM OF THE EARTH. AND DON'T YOU EVER FORGET IT. COME HERE, BUNNY. HERE AT IVORY HALL, WE HAVE A FEW LITTLE TRADITIONS. - THE FEWER AND LITTLER THE BETTER. - Agnes: YES. CUCUMBER SANDWICHES PARKED ALWAYS TO THE RIGHT, LEMON TEA IS DRUNK ONLY ON TUESDAYS AND THURSDAYS, EXCEPT IN LENT, AND YOU MUST NEVER USE YOUR KNIFE FOR BUTTERING HOT MUFFINS... UNLESS YOU ARE A MEMBER OF HIS MAJESTY'S ARMED FORCES. I TRUST YOU WILL ENDEAVOR NOT TO FORGET THEM. I SHALL NOT FORGET THEM. I SHALL IGNORE THEM. - ( rings bell ) - ( grunts ) EMILY, DEAR, DO LAUGH AT MR. TRILLING'S DELIGHTFUL WITTICISM. CERTAINLY, THE MOMENT HE MAKES ONE. ( rings bell ) HUDSON! OH, GOD. MMM. THESE CUCUMBER SANDWICHES ARE MARVELOUS, ARE THEY NOT? HUDSON BAKED THE LOAF HIMSELF. THE CUCUMBER OUGHT TO BE MORE FINELY SLICED, AND THE TEXTURE OF THE BREAD IS RATHER TOO ROUGH. IS THE TEA TO YOUR LIKING? IT IS EXACTLY AS THE POET HOMER DESCRIBED. "LIKE THE POISONOUS BROWN JUICE WHICH FLOWS FROM THE GIANT LIZARD OF HELL." AND WHAT ABOUT THE CHAIR? IS THE CHAIR ON WHICH YOU ARE SITTING SATISFACTORY? PERHAPS IT'S MADE OUT OF THE WRONG TYPE OF WOOD. PERHAPS THE UPHOLSTERY IS AS THE POET HOMER DESCRIBED-- SHE IS SOMEWHAT NERVOUS IN THE PRESENCE OF SUITORS. OH, AUNT AGNES, I HAVE NO INTENTION OF MARRYING MR. TRILLING. EMILY. - I MUST CONFESS I DO NOT LIKE HIM IN THE SLIGHTEST. - EMILY! - IN FACT, I HATE HIM. HE HAS NO MANNERS. I SHOULD RATHER KILL MYSELF THAN MARRY HIM. I DO HOPE I HAVE NOT OFFENDED YOU IN ANY WAY. NO, NO, NO. I SHALL WRITE A LETTER OF APOLOGY IMMEDIATELY. IT IS I WHO IS IN THE WRONG. I SHALL DEPART FOR CAMBRIDGE STRAIGHTAWAY. YOU CAN'T GO! WE CAN'T PLAY CROQUET WITH ONLY THREE OF US. Edward: OH, HUDSON! CROQUET, PLEASE. CERTAINLY, SIR. Agnes's voice: TODAY HAS GONE SPLENDIDLY. EMILY FEIGNS DISLIKE, BUT I SENSE A WEAKENING ON HER PART. Emily's voice: HIS MUSTACHE QUITE RESEMBLES A PAIR OF WET HEDGEHOG'S PORES. ( sighs ) PERHAPS I WAS TOO HASTY ABOUT THE VICAR'S EYEBROWS. ( sighs ) Cedric's voice: THERE IS SOMETHING ABOUT HER SLIM, ELEGANT FIGURE THAT RATHER REMINDS ME OF EDWARD. HMM. Edward's voice: DEAR DIARY. IT IS SUCH FUN TO BE BACK AT IVORY HALL. I AM VERY PLEASED TO SEE MY BEARS AGAIN, AND THEY ARE VERY PLEASED TO SEE ME. ( toy bear groans ) NIGHTY-NIGHT, TEDDERS. Man on record: Allowable Face Movements for Butlers: Part Three. The upper lip must never tremble. It might be interpreted as human emotion, which is most unacceptable. MM-HMM. When being insulted, a hint of a polite smile is customary. Teeth must never be revealed. Gums should be cleaned daily with seven parts sulfuric acid to one part water in order not to offend the noses of employ-- WHERE WILL YOU GO? OH, ME NANA'S KINDLY INVITED ME TO LONDON TOWN TO STAY WITH HER AND BE A PROSTITUTE. YOU ARE INDEED FORTUNATE TO HAVE SUCH AN UNDERSTANDING FAMILY. IF YOU'RE EVER PASSING, DO POP IN. ( chuckles ) LIKE HER AND ME MUM AND ME SISTER, I HOPE TO BEAR MANY ILLEGITIMATE CHILDREN INTO ABJECT POVERTY. AND YOU? WILL YOU MANAGE ON YOUR OWN? I AM A HUDSON. AND YOU NEVER GET BITTER? ( rings ) NEVER? - ( ringing ) - ( door closes ) ( sighs ) ( laughs ) MMM. I DO WISH YOU WOULD LET ME LEND YOU A PAIR OF TRUNKS. Cedric: I'M QUITE HAPPY LIKE THIS. SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK OF MY SISTER? SHUSH. SOMEONE MAY OVERHEAR US. CEDERS. IF YOU INSIST ON TALKING ABOUT THIS MATTER, I, FOR MY PART, INSIST WE DO IT IN LATIN. UM... ( speaking Latin ) SHE HAS JACKDAWS THAT MUST BE BAKED? SLIM HIPS. OH. WHAT ELSE? WHAT? SHE OWNS WARLIKE SWANS? NOT OLORUS BELLICOSUS. OCULUS BELLUS. OH, EYES! WARLIKE EYES. NO, BEAUTIFUL EYES. BEAUTIFUL EYES. SHE HAS BEAUTIFUL EYES. AND? Cedric: AND... SHE HAS GHOSTS FROM BELGIUM? MAMMAS, BREASTS. BELLUS IS RATHER PRETTY OR INTERESTING! SHE HAS RATHER PRETTY OR INTERESTING BREASTS! Edward: AND WHAT DO YOU THINK OF HER CHARACTER? SOMETHING SOMETHING SOMETHING SURGEON. EXACTLY. ( shrieks ) SHE CAN'T SWIM. WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO? I DON'T KNOW. SHE'S YOUR SISTER. WE'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING. Emily: HELP! - ( speaking Latin ) - WHAT? ( yelling in Latin ) ( speaking Latin ) ( speaking Latin ) ( coughing ) ( gasping ) THANK YOU. I--I OWE YOU MY LIFE. BUT, BRAVE STRANGER, WHO ARE YOU? MY NAME'S GEORGE. Emily: GEORGE. YOU HAVE A RIPPING SET OF UNMENTIONABLES. EW. HE'S A VILLAGER. HOW DARE YOU! CLEAR OFF, YOU HORRID RUFFIAN. SHE COULD HAVE DROWNED. GO BACK TO YOUR HOVEL. WELL SAID, CEDERS. I SAVED HER LIFE! YOU DID NOT SAVE MY LIFE. AND IT IS IMPERTINENT, ALTHOUGH TYPICAL, OF YOUR OBVIOUS PEASANT UPBRINGING TO THINK THAT YOU DID. IN FACT, CEDRIC SAVED MY LIFE... BY SHOUTING SO BRAVELY. NOW, I'M WILLING NOT TO REPORT THIS TO A CONSTABLE SO LONG AS YOU GO AWAY AND NEVER SPEAK OF IT TO ANYONE. SHOO. ( sneezes ) SHOO! AgneI CAN'T BELIEVE THAT YOU DID NOT EXPRESS YOUR GRATITUDE. HE WAS A PEASANT, AND HE HAD NO CLOTHES ON. I PROBABLY CAUGHT SOME AWFUL DISEASE JUST FROM BEING IN CLOSE CONTACT WITH HIM. Agnes: NO CLOTHES ON AT ALL? IT WAS QUITE, QUITE HORRID. AH--AH--AH... AH... NOTHING? NO. - MAY I HAVE SOME MORE SOUP, PLEASE, HUDSON? - CERTAINLY. AND HE WAS STANDING WITH HIS FRONT TOWARDS YOU? YES, AND I COULD SEE SOMETHING... DANGLING. - ( clears throat ) - EdwarI CAN VOUCH FOR THAT. ALTHOUGH HIS DANGLING WAS NOTHING LIKE MINE. WHAT ABOUT YOU, CEDERS? IT WAS A WORKING-CLASS DANGLING. HE DIDN'T DANGLE WITH DIGNITY. AHEM! AHEM! AHEM! QUITE RIGHT, HUDSON. IT IS REALLY QUITE IMPROPER THAT A MATTER SUCH AS THIS SHOULD BE DISCUSSED OVER DINNER. ( sneezes ) SEND FOR THE DOCTOR. CERTAINLY, MA'AM. AND HOW ARE WE TODAY? ILL. SHE HAS AN AWFUL COLD. WHAT TREATMENT DO YOU RECOMMEND, DOCTOR? PLEASE REMOVE ALL YOUR GARMENTS. SHALL I GO? WELL, THE OINTMENT IS RATHER SMELLY. OH, YES, RIGHT. ( plays ) - HUDSON? - SIR? RIGHT. HURRY UP. - THANK YOU. - SIR. WHAT IS THAT YOU'RE READING? SHOW ME. SHOW ME. IT'S THE NEW E.M. FORSTER NOVEL. OH, NOT ANOTHER ONE. IS IT AMUSING? WELL, I FIND IT DIFFICULT TO IDENTIFY WITH THE CHARACTERS, BUT THE LOCATIONS ARE QUITE ENCHANTING. THIS STEAMY TRIFLE IS BY A MISS CARTLAND. ( grunts ) Doctor: I DON'T HAVE ALL DAY, MISS EMILY. I'M GOING AS FAST AS I CAN. ( Emily grunts ) I WONDER IF I MIGHT HAVE A WORD, MA'AM. OF COURSE, HUDSON. WHAT IS IT? HOW CAN I BEST PUT THIS? UH, MY FAMILY HAS WORKED FOR YOUR FAMILY GOING BACK FIVE GENERATIONS NOW. TRADITION IS A FINE, FINE THING. INDEED, MA'AM. UH, HOW BEST TO PUT THIS? AFTER YEARS OF DEVOTED SERVICE, FRANKLY... I'M GETTING A SHADE PEED OFF. HUDSON! YOU HAVE DISMISSED, MA'AM, ALL MY SENIOR UNDER-BUTLERS, AND, MA'AM, MY JUNIOR OVER-BUTLER'S LEAVING ME, MA'AM, TO RUN THIS ENTIRE ESTATE. HUDSON-- DON'T "HUDSON" ME, IF I MAY BE SO BOLD. YOUR IDIOT FAMILY IS QUITE BARKING MAD. WELL... IS THIS WHY YOU'VE BEEN URINATING IN THE SOUP AGAIN? THERE WILL BE WORSE TO COME, MA'AM, IN THE MAIN COURSE AND THE PUDDING, IF I DON'T GET A BREAK OF SOME SORT. WHAT A CAPITAL IDEA. EDWARD? ( both playing ) HUDSON HAS JUST GIVEN ME THE MOST DELIGHTFUL IDEA. I PROPOSE THE BEST CURE FOR EMILY'S AWFUL COLD IS A TRIP TO ITALY. BUT WHAT ABOUT THE OINTMENT? OH, YES, PLEASE. A HOLIDAY WILL MAKE ME FEEL SO MUCH BETTER. SHE COULD DIE UNLESS SHE GETS THIS OINTMENT. I CAN MAKE THE ARRANGEMENTS AT ONCE! OH! WHAT ABOUT THE OINTMENT? UM, I'VE GOT A BIT OF A SNUFFLE. GOOD EVENING, DEAR LADY. MR. TWEEB. GOOD EVENING. MAY I VENTURE TO ASK IF THERE IS ANY NEWS? ABOUT WHAT? MY PROPOSAL TO YOUR NIECE. OH, DEAR. DID I FORGET TO TELL YOU? SHE SAID NO. SHE SAID YOUR EYEBROWS WERE TOO BUSHY. AND ANYWAY, SHE HAS A NEW ADMIRER. GOOD EVENING. ♪ THEY ALL SUPPOSE WHAT THEY WANT TO SUPPOSE ♪ ♪ IT'S THE SAME OOMPAH-PAH. ♪ ( singing stops ) - MA'AM. - MA'AM. I'M LOOKING FOR THE YOUNG MAN WHO RESCUED MY NIECE. I BELIEVE HIS NAME IS GEORGE. MY NIECE DREW THIS. ( men muttering ) THAT'LL BE ERIC'S LAD. WHERE IS THIS ERIC? EXCUSE ME, GOOD LADY. BEGGING YOUR PARDON AND EVERYTHING. YOUR LADYSHIP, I HAVE A SON, YOUR EXTREME DAINTINESS, WHOSE NAME, IF IT PLEASES YOUR WORSHIP, IS GEORGE. ( slowly ) IS HE ALSO AN IMBECILE? HOW DARE YOU TOUCH A LADY! BUT SHE WAS DROWNING, DAD! SO? HER, IN A DELICATE, AS WHITE AS LINEN! AND YOU AND YOUR FILTHY PEASANT RAGS! I DON'T BELIEVE SO. OH. YOU WERE NAKED. NAKED? IN THE SAME COUNTY AS YOUR NIECE WITHOUT HIS PANTS ON. BUT SHE COULD HAVE BLOODY DIED, ALL RIGHT? I BEG YOU, DEAR SWEET LADY. IS THERE SOME WAY HE COULD PUT RIGHT THE TERRIBLE WRONG HE HAS DONE TO YOU, YOUR FAMILY, AND THE KING? OH, GET UP, FOR GOODNESS' SAKE. THERE IS INDEED A WAY HE CAN PUT RIGHT THIS DREADFUL WRONG. OH, THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. YOU SHALL ACCOMPANY US ON A TRIP TO ITALY AS SERVANT. SERVANT? Eric: THANK YOU! HOW BLOODY TYPICAL OF YOUR BLOODY CLASS. I'M NOT GOING. I'M STAYING HERE. MY DAD NEEDS ME. BOLLOCKS I DO. A SON OF MINE SERVANT TO HOLIDAYING GENTLEFOLK? IF ONLY MY DAD COULD HAVE LIVED TO SEE THIS HAPPY DAY. OF COURSE, I UNDERSTAND IF YOU WOULD PREFER TO REMAIN HERE FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE, JUST YOU, YOUR FATHER, AND A HOVEL FULL OF RABBIT ENTRAILS. Eric: ITALY! CAN YOU IMAGINE? BUT WHY? WHY HIM? HUDSON CAN'T GO. BUT WHY? ( sneezes ) HE HAS... HE HAS A BLADDER PROBLEM. - BUT WHY? - BECAUSE! AND ONE MORE "BUT WHY" FROM YOU AND WE SHAN'T GO AT ALL. OH, AUNT AGNES, I HATE YOU! I HATE YOU! I HATE YOU! AUNT AGNES? HELP? HELP! ( indistinct chatter ) ( classical music playing ) ( exhales ) OH, NO. AUNT AGNES! THIS IS NOT AT ALL WHAT WE WERE LED TO EXPECT! ( Italian music plays ) Emily: EDWARD, LET GO! LET GO! OH, EDWARD, WHY DO YOU HAVE TO BE SUCH A BABY? IT'S MY ROOM. NOW JUST LET GO OF THE KEY. YOU KNOW YOU DON'T LIKE SUNSHINE. IT GIVES YOU HEADACHES. ( taps glass ) WHAT IF EMILY EXCHANGES WITH ME? THEN I'LL EXCHANGE WITH EDWARD SO THAT EDWARD CAN EXCHANGE WITH MR. TWEEB. WHAT A COINCIDENCE YOU'RE STAYING HERE. IT IS A COINCIDENCE. UTTERLY... - George: DAMN. - COINCIDENTAL. WELL, THEN, MR. TWEEB CAN EXCHANGE WITH-- HELLFIRE. HE CAN SWAP WITH US. WE GOT A GREAT VIEW. BACK HOME, ALL THE ROOMS HAVE FANTASTIC VIEWS. THEN KINDLY RETURN THERE AT ONCE. AS I WAS SAYING, MR. TWEEB CAN EXCHANGE WITH... UM, WHO'S LEFT? ME. I AM NOT SLEEPING IN THE STABLES. MIGHT I BE ALLOWED TO SUGGEST A SOLUTION? EDWARD CAN SHARE MY ROOM. OH, YES. AND GEORGE CAN HAVE EDWARD'S ROOM. - THERE. SEE HOW SIMPLE IT ALL IS? - George: SOD IT! I THINK WE'LL MANAGE WITHOUT THE GRAVY, GEORGE. ISN'T IT ALL SO BEAUTIFUL, AUNT AGNES? THE CITY'S SUCH A DANGEROUS PLACE FOR AN INNOCENT, YOUNG ENGLISHWOMAN. ANYTHING COULD HAPPEN. GEORGE? OH, LET'S HOPE SO. I THINK I MIGHT RUN NAKED THROUGH THE ANCIENT RUINS. YOU WILL DO NO SUCH THING. PEOPLE PASSING BY MIGHT SEE YOUR PRIVATE PARTS. GEORGE. SINCE WE ARRIVED IN ITALY, THOSE PARTS HAVE BECOME A SOURCE OF MUCH PLEASURE AND MUCH FRUSTRATION. Agnes: THINK OF CEDRIC. HE'LL NEVER MARRY YOU. THERE ARE PLENTY MORE FISH IN THE GRAND CANAL. ACCORDING TO MY GUIDEBOOK, IF WE TURN LEFT AND THEN FIRST RIGHT, WE SHOULD BE STANDING DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF THE EIFFEL TOWER. ( clears throat ) EMILY. EMILY? ( speaking Italian ) ( speaking Italian ) EMILY! STOP IT! BUT, AUNT AGNES, I'M THIRSTY. THEY MIGHT GET THE WRONG IDEA. THEY MIGHT THINK THAT, WELL, UH... THAT YOU WANT TO GET MARRIED TO THEM. YOU'RE DESPERATE FOR ME TO GET MARRIED. YES, BUT NOT TO AN ITALIAN. MY FEET ARE HURTING. I'VE GOT BLISTERS THE SIZE OF BOGNOR. THAT'S NOTHING. MY BLISTERS ARE EXACTLY AS THE POET-- Emily: WOULD YOU SHUT UP? - GEORGE? - WHAT? AH. LAY THE LAWN, PLEASE, GEORGE. THANK YOU, GEORGE. LOAD IT ALL UP AGAIN. ( laughing ) ( both snoring) CEDRIC. ( sing-song ) OH, CEDRIC. IT'S ME. EMILY. HUH? WHAT'S GOING ON? EDWARD, CLEAR OFF OR I'LL HIT YOU. RIGHT-O. IT IS REALLY NOT PROPER FOR YOU TO BE HERE. WHAT WOULD YOUR AUNT SAY? MR. TRILLING, YOU ARE MOST HANDSOME. I FEAR SHE WOULD SAY NO SUCH THING. ( blowing ) EDWARD! I'M A YOUNG VIRGIN IN ITALY. I WANT MY SEXUAL AWAKENING, AND I WANT IT NOW. UHH!

AS DECENT A PAIR OF EYEBROWS AS I'VE SEEN ON A MEMBER OF THE CLERGY. WELL DONE. SUCH UNFORTUNATE NASAL HAIR. OH, LOOK! AH, MR. TRILLING. WHAT CAN POSSIBLY COMPARE TO A SIMPLE PICNIC? A DOG BITE. TOOTH EXTRACTION. WAR. FOOD ALWAYS TASTES NICER IN THE OPEN AIR. NO, IT ALWAYS TASTES EXACTLY THE SAME. IT'S A BEAUTIFUL DAY. AND WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF A QUITE SPECTACULAR COUNTRYSIDE. WHY MUST YOU ALWAYS CRITICIZE EVERYTHING? IT'S MY HOBBY. I THOUGHT PERHAPS YOU WERE COMPENSATING FOR SOME INADEQUACY. ( sniffs ) ( dishes clatter ) COME FOR A WALK. I'M BUSY. I'M GOING FOR A WALK, AND I WANT YOU TO COME WITH ME. I SAID I'M-- ( opera playing ) KISS ME. NO. JUST 'CAUSE I'M EMPLOYED AS YOUR SERVANT DOESN'T GIVE YOU THE RIGHT TO ABUSE ME LIKE A PIECE OF WOOD.

I WILL CONSIDER YOUR PROPOSAL AND REPLY TO YOU BY LETTER. NOW... BRING ME MY BREAKFAST. Emily's voice: DEAR GEORGE. I'M MOST FRIGHTFULLY SORRY, BUT I MUST REFUSE YOUR KIND OFFER OF MARRIAGE. YOURS SINCERELY, MISS E. IVORY. George's voice: I CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHY YOU HAVE REJECTED ME. PLEASE RECONSIDER. GEORGE. Emily's voice: I CANNOT POSSIBLY MARRY BENEATH MY STATION. EMILY. George's voice: WHY NOT? Emily's voice: BECAUSE! George's voice: BECAUSE WHAT? IS CLASS A BARRIER TO TRUE LOVE? DID LAST NIGHT MEAN NOTHING TO YOU? Eric's voice: DEAR SON. PEOPLE LIKE US ARE THE SCUM OF THE EARTH, AND DON'T YOU EVER FORGET IT. FULL STOP. YOUR DAD. FULL STOP. WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU, CHILD? NOTHING. WELL, THEN... STOP LOOKING LIKE SOMEONE WHO JUST LOST HER VIRGINITY. WHAT? OI, GIVE ME MY BALL BACK. Agnes: MR. TRILLING. DO AMUSE US WITH YOUR RAPIER-LIKE WIT. NO. ( laughs ) ( men singing in Italian ) THIS LAWN IS AWFULLY HEAVY. ISN'T IT EMILY'S TURN? I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY YOU HAD TO GIVE THE SERVANT THE DAY OFF. I HAD NO CHOICE. HE EXPLAINED IT ALL TO ME. A SERVANT HAS HALF A DAY OFF EACH FORTNIGHT OR A WHOLE DAY IF IT'S IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY. Edward: WHY DID YOU AGREE TO THAT? BECAUSE IF I DIDN'T AGREE, HE'D GO ON STRIKE. I'LL HORSEWHIP HIS BACKSIDE. - AND SO WILL I. - I SAID IT FIRST. THAT LOOKS LIKE HIS BACKSIDE TO ME. I'LL LEAVE YOU TWO TO FIGHT IT OUT. WE'RE GOING BACK TO THE PENSIONE. EMILY. OH, PLEASE LET ME STAY. I'LL BE SAFE WITH EDWARD. SAFE WITH EDWARD? HAVE YOU LOST YOUR SENSES? AND WITH THE HANDSOME MR. TRILLING. WHAT COLOR AM I AGAIN? BLACK. MY BROTHER AND CEDRIC ARE PLAYING CHESS FOR THE HONOR OF HORSEWHIPPING YOUR BACKSIDE. BLACK, EH? HMM. EH? ( arguing in Italian ) WHAT DID HE SAY? "SHE'S MINE. I HAVE HER." AND THEN THE OTHER ONE SAID, "NO, I WANT-- I WANT TO PIERCE OR OTHERWISE PENETRATE." HURRY UP, OLD CHAP. THIS IS A LATIN DICTIONARY, EDWARD, NOT ITALIAN. I'M ENDEAVORING TO PROVIDE AS ACCURATE A TRANSLATION AS I CAN. MY SISTER'S OVER THERE! YOU'VE GOT TO HELP! SHE MIGHT BE PIERCED OR OTHERWISE PENETRATED! IT'S MY DAY OFF. ( ticking ) ( sniffs ) IT'S GETTING VERY LATE. I DO HOPE THEY'RE SAFE. NO, THANK YOU. THE BRITISH CAN LOOK AFTER THEMSELVES. ( scoffs ) YEAH, RIGHT. SO, SHE'S COMPLETELY REPULSED BY ALL MANNER OF FACIAL HAIR, THEN? YES, I'M AFRAID SHE IS. AREN'T YOU GOING TO RESCUE ME? OW! I INSIST THAT YOU RESCUE ME AT ONCE! NO. I'M TOO COMMON. I NEVER SAID YOU WERE COMMON. THEN WHY WON'T YOU MARRY ME? MAYBE I'M AFRAID TO COMMIT. I COME FROM A VERY REPRESSED BACKGROUND. I'M TRYING TO COME TO TERMS WITH THE REAL ME, AND I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO THE REAL ME IS. I HAVE TO LEARN TO LOVE MYSELF. WELL? WHAT HAPPENED? WE HAD TO LEAVE EMILY IN THE BAR IN THE MIDDLE OF A REALLY BIG FIGHT. AS THE POET HOMER SAID, LIKE A RIVER OF ROSY-DAPPLED ENTRAILS." WE MUST WRITE TO THE BRITISH AMBASSADOR AT ONCE. YOU MAY HAVE CUTE ACCENTS, BUT YOU'VE NO IDEA HOW TO PROTECT YOURSELVES. - ( cocks rifle ) - LET'S GO, HON. EMILY! THANK YOU, GEORGE. I REALLY CAN'T ABIDE THESE PUBLIC DISPLAYS OF AFFECTION. YOU KNOW, YOU ARE WHAT WE CALL A REAL TIGHT ASS. YOU'RE MOST KIND. THIS TRIP HAS BEEN AN AWFUL MISTAKE. FIRST I HAD MY UNDERWEAR STOLEN, AND NOW THIS. ITALY IS SO FOREIGN. LOOK AT THE EFFECT IT HAS HAD ON POOR MR. TWEEB. ( groans ) I PROPOSE WE GO SOMEWHERE MORE ENGLISH. THE LAWN, PLEASE, GEORGE. ( Indian music playing ) Agnes: IT IS SO KIND OF YOU TO TAKE US IN. ITALY WROUGHT HAVOC WITH EMILY'S DELICATE CONSTITUTION. WE COULDN'T FIND A SINGLE PENSIONE IN ALL OF DELHI. GREAT-UNCLE HORACE OWNS THE BIGGEST TEA PLANTATION IN INDIA. IT COVERS AN AREA FOUR TIMES THE SIZE OF SCOTLAND. IT'S PRETTIER THAN SCOTLAND. MORE INTERESTING THAN SCOTLAND. AND BEST OF ALL, THERE ARE NO SCOTSMEN LIVING HERE. OF COURSE WE MUSTN'T OUTSTAY OUR WELCOME. WE SHALL LEAVE FOR ENGLAND AS SOON AS EMILY'S ABILITY TO HOLD HER BREAKFAST DOWN IMPROVES. OR TOMORROW. EDWARD! STOP IT AT ONCE! WHEN IN ROME... PUT IT AWAY. INDIA'S DRIVEN MANY PEOPLE ABSOLUTELY MAD, INCLUDING MYSELF. YES, WELL, I'M SURE EMILY'S FEELING BETTER ALREADY. LET'S BE OFF. DEAR LADY, THE PRESENCE OF A BEAUTIFUL ENGLISHWOMAN IS RARE IN THESE PARTS. YOU, TOO, HAVE DESIGNS ON MY NIECE. AREN'T YOU A LITTLE ON THE OLD SIDE? I WASN'T REFERRING TO YOUR NIECE. OH. DEAR SWEET LADY. HOW MANY THOUSANDS OF MEN'S HEARTS HAVE YOU SHATTERED? ( chuckles ) SO MANY DEAR BOYS. INCLUDING OUR OWN KING, WHEN HE WAS PRINCE OF WALES. OH. GOOD GRIEF. HE'S WHITE. OH, THAT'S RIGHT. I'M WHITE. SO WHAT? ALL MEN ARE EQUAL. AND ALL WOMEN. THE WORLD IS A CHANGING PLACE. ( scoffs ) BALDERDASH. HA HA. ONE DAY, EVERYBODY WILL BE PAID THE SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY. I WON'T HAVE AN ENGLISH SERVANT IN MY HOUSE! IT'S BAD FOR MORALE. IT MAY CAUSE THE WHOLE EMPIRE TO CRUMBLE. I HAVE MY RIGHTS. RIGHTS? THIS IS NOT SOME NAMBY-PAMBY SUBURB OF LONDON, SIR. THIS IS THE RAJ! RAJ OR NOT, HE'S ALL WE HAVE. WE SHAN'T STAY WHERE WE'RE NOT WELCOME. DISGRACEFUL. ( frogs croaking ) ( monkeys screeching ) OH. ( gasps ) ( gasps ) AAH! HAVE YOU BEEN DRINKING THE WATER? WE WERE WARNED ABOUT DELHI BELLY. AND I'M WARNING YOU ABOUT THE MADRAS MADNESS, AN ALL-CONSUMING FEVER CAUSED BY THE WATER. YOU BECOME OBSESSED WITH SEX. YOU SEE IT EVERYWHERE YOU LOOK. THE IMAGINATION CONJURES UP THE WILDEST FANTASIES. YOU FEEL POWERLESS. YOUR KNEES GO WEAK. ONE SIP AND ALL-- I ASSURE YOU, I HAVEN'T TOUCHED THE WATER. YOUR EYES ARE LIKE DEEP SHIMMERING POOLS OF TEA. YOUR THIGHS LIKE STRONG YOUNG TEA PLANTS. YOUR BREASTS, UH... LIKE BEAUTIFUL... MEDIUM-SIZED SACKS OF TEA LEAVES. YOUR ANKLES ARE LIKE... THAT'S QUITE ENOUGH TEA TALK. ...TWO LUMPS OF SUGAR? IF I STAY, GEORGE STAYS. ( stammers ) CEDRIC? HUH? DO YOU EVER HAVE STRANGE FEELINGS? WHAT SORT OF STRANGE FEELINGS? WELL... SOMETIMES I JUST FEEL STRANGE. I SEE. I ALSO HAVE STRANGE FEELINGS. PLEASANT ONES? I'M AFRAID I CANNOT SAY WHETHER THEY ARE PLEASANT OR NOT. SOCIETY DOES NOT ALLOW IT. I SUGGEST YOU HIDE THESE FEELINGS IN A CLOSET. MMM. SPIFFY. ( Indian accent ) IF IT BE PLEASING TO YOU, I AM BRINGING YOU A GIN AND TONIC. ( regular voice ) IT IS AS EASY AS THAT. REMEMBER THE LATERAL HEAD OSCILLATION. THAT IS FRIGHTFULLY IMPORTANT. ( Indian accent ) IF YOU NOT BE LIKING A GIN AND TONIC, I CAN BE OBTAINING WHATSOEVER OTHER DRINK YOU MAY BE PREFERRING. WOOBLE, WOOBLE, WOOBLE. I FEEL TERRIBLE. ( playing ) I HATE IT HERE. WE ALL DO. INDIA. ( mosquito buzzing ) THE SMELLS. THE HEAT. THE DUST. THIS MOSQUITO NET! WHEN CAN WE LEAVE? DON'T BE HASTY, CHILD. CEDRIC'S GREAT-UNCLE HAS INVITED US TO STAY. WE MUST DO WHATEVER HE WANTS. - WHENEVER HE WANTS. - AUNT AGNES. HOWEVER MANY TIMES HE WANTS. WHERE ARE YOU, MY DARLING? AH, THERE'S MY FILLY. SPLENDID GAME, HUH? AgneYOU LOOK RATHER REGAL LIKE THAT. AHHHH. DID YOU SEE THAT? AgneI CAN SEE YOU'VE PLAYED THIS BEFORE. - OH. - ( laughs ) FETCH. AgneYOU CAN'T POSSIBLY PLAY WITHOUT A BALL. I'M PREGNANT. WELL? AREN'T YOU GOING TO SAY ANYTHING? COULD WE HAVE OUR BALL BACK, PLEASE? ( laughs ) WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO? I SUPPOSE I'LL HAVE IT PUT DOWN. PUT DOWN? FOR CAMBRIDGE. OH, MY, EMILY. Agnes: EDWARD, WILL YOU PLEASE GET THE BALL? HEY NONNY-NONNY! OI! YOU! OIK! PUT MY SISTER DOWN AND GIVE US OUR BALL BACK. Edward: OW! NOW WE CAN GET MARRIED. CAN'T WE? I'M SO ASHAMED. Agnes: OH, THESE DAMN FLIES. - ( slapping ) - DAMN FLIES. - ( slapping ) - THESE DAMN FLIES! ( slapping ) ( Horace giggles ) OH, THESE DAMN FLIES! ( chuckles ) WHAT WAS THAT? Horace: DON'T STOP. WHERE ARE YOU GOING? TIME TO SPREAD THE BRITISH EMPIRE. "DEAR GEORGE. NO NEED FOR BREAKFAST. EMILY." "DEAR AUNT AGNES. I AM WITH CHILD AFTER A MOST SORDID--" "AFTER A MOST SORDID ENCOUNTER IN ROME. PLEASE TELL NO ONE. I AM SO SORRY. EMILY." I'M GOING TO BE UNCLE EDDERS. "DEAR CEDRIC. GOODBYE FOREVER." EMILY! UHH! EMILY! EMILY! ( woman shouting ) TEA? ANY MORE? TEA? TEA? TEA? I SAY, MISS? - TEA? - I SAY. EXCUSE ME. MISS, I SAID EXCUSE ME. CHI? TEA? CHI? ( brakes squeaking ) ( people screaming ) ( groaning ) I'LL HAVE A POT OF EARL GREY. Emily's voice: RECENT ENCOUNTERS HAD CONVINCED ME THAT MY PRIVILEGED UPBRINGING HAD KEPT ME FROM SEEING HOW THE OTHER HALF LIVE. I DETERMINED TO RECTIFY THE SITUATION IMMEDIATELY AND LEARN TO BE MORE UNDERSTANDING. ( children shouting ) SHOO. SHOO. SHOO. DON'T TOUCH THAT. PLEASE DON'T TOUCH THAT. SHOO! WHO'S IN CHARGE OF THESE WRETCHED ANIMALS? HAS ANYONE SEEN THIS GIRL? ANYONE? UH... DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING SLIGHTLY LESS RESTRICTIVE? UH, EXCUSE ME. HAVE YOU SEEN THIS GIRL? HAVE YOU SEEN THIS GIRL? HAS ANYONE SEEN THIS GIRL? ( whistles ) DON'T YOU WHISTLE AT ME, YOU INDIAN SUBJECT. NOW, WHERE ON EARTH IS CEDRIC? IS THAT YOU, CEDERS? QUITE REMARKABLE. WELL DONE. NOW, WE JUST NEED TO FIND OUT THE INDIAN FOR "HAVE YOU SEEN THIS GIRL?" AH. HOW DO YOU SAY "HAVE YOU SEEN THIS GIRL?" ( coughs ) EDWARD, IT'S ME. EDVARD ES ME. EDVARD ES-- GOT IT. UM... EDVARD ES ME? EDVARD ES ME? EDVARD ES ME? - EDWARD, YOU FOOL, IT'S ME! - DON'T CONFUSE ME. EDVARD ES ME IS MORE THAN A MOUTHFUL. - EDVARD ES ME? - ( speaking Hindi ) SORRY, CEDERS? EDWARD! HAVE YOU BEEN TAKING HASHISH? CEDRIC? YOU ROTTER. HAVE I BEEN TAKING WHAT? - HASHISH! - BLESS YOU. Man: GANDHI? GANDHI! GANDHI! Crowd: GANDHI! GANDHI! CEDERS? THEY'RE STILL THERE, CEDERS. NEVER MIND. MAYBE ONE OF THEM KNOWS WHERE EMILY IS. WE WILL CONTINUE THE SEARCH FOR THE MOTHER OF MY CHILD AS SOON AS I ACQUIRE MORE APPROPRIATE CLOTHING. ( chanting ) GANDHI, GANDHI, GANDHI. Emily's voice: CHRIST, THIS FOOD IS DISGUSTING. IT'S NO WONDER THEY'RE SO THIN. ACCORDING TO THE MAP, THIS MISSION THING IS VERY, VERY CLOSE. DO YOU MAKE AN EFFORT TO BE STUPID OR DOES IT COME NATURALLY? ARE THOSE THE ONLY TWO CHOICES? SHUT UP. PLEASE SHUT UP, I'M BEGGING YOU. WHAT'S THE MATTER? WHAT IF SHE SAYS NO? MY, GOD, CEDERS, THIS IS IT. WE FOUND IT. CEDERS? CEDERS! - ( gasps ) - MR. TRILLING. UH, MISS IVORY, HAVING CAREFULLY CONSIDERED THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES, I FEEL IT IS MY DUTY TO ASK YOU TO BECOME MY WIFE SO THAT NO MAN MAY SAY A TRILLING CHILD MIGHT BE A BASTARD. YOU MAKE IT SOUND SO ROMANTIC. PERHAPS I MIGHT TRY-- IS THERE A LITTLE BOY'S ROOM? OH. BE MY GUEST. IT'S NOT MUCH MORE THAN A HOLE IN THE GROUND. OH, FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE. SHE'S NOT OVER HERE, CEDERS. ( toilet flushes ) - SO... WILL YOU MARRY ME OR NO? I'VE MADE LOVE TO GEORGE. I THINK WE'RE ON THE WRONG MISSION. - EDWARD. - HELLO, SIS. YOUR TROLLOP SISTER'S HAD CARNAL DALLIANCES WITH GEORGE. IT'S TRUE. - EMILY, HOW COULD YOU? - WELL, I... BE THAT AS IT MAY, WE MUST WED FOR THE SAKE OF OUR CHILD. AND WHAT, PRAY, IF I'M NOT PREGNANT? - WHAT? - YOU'RE REALLY NOT WITH CHILD? ( elephant trumpets ) HURRAH. HEY NONNY-NONNY. ( elephant trumpets ) - EMILY! - GEORGE! ( elephant trumpets ) THIS GEORGE IS PROVING RATHER TROUBLESOME. I WAS QUITE LOOKING FORWARD TO THE THREE OF US LIVING TOGETHER. I WANT THE HAND OF YOUR NIECE. EMILY MUST MAKE HER OWN DECISIONS. AAH! - SO YOU WOULDN'T OBJECT? - I DON'T GIVE A MONKEY'S. ( bubbling ) STOP! ( whispering ) I GOT THEM, BUT THERE'S NO NAME IN THEM. ( whispering ) OH, DAMN. DAMN. DAMN. DAMN. ( fire roaring ) ( mumbling ) ( indistinct chatter ) OH, DAMN! SAVE THE LAWN! FUCK THE LAWN! SAVE THE PLANTATION! ( indistinct shouting ) ABSO-BLOODY-LUTELY TYPICAL. I MEAN YOU LOT ALWAYS STICK TOGETHER, DON'T YOU? DON'T YOU?! WITH YOUR FANCY WAYS AND YOUR LA-DE-DA TALK. YEAH, WELL, I MAY BE SCUM, BUT I AM PROUD OF IT! YOU MAY THINK YOU CAN CONTROL THE WHOLE BLOODY WORLD WITH YOUR EMPIRE, BUT LET ME TELL YOU THIS: THAT I, GEORGE, HAVE EVERY FAITH IN THE INDIAN JUSTICE SYSTEM. THE BRITISH LEGAL SYSTEM IS THE GREATEST IN THE WORLD IN THAT THERE IS NO OTHER LEGAL SYSTEM. IT IS THE VERY FOUNDATION OF CIVILIZATION ITSELF. PRISONER, HOW DO YOU PLEAD? NOT GUILTY. LET IT BE RECORDED THAT THE CONDEMNED PLEADED NOT GUILTY. CONDEMNED? YOU JUST SAID CONDEMNED. - OBJECTION! - YOU'RE MY LAWYER! - OBJECTION! - OVERRULED. LUNCH. NOT YOU. THANK YOU. WELL, GET ON WITH IT. Lawyer: YOU ARE CEDRIC TRILLING? CEDRIC LIONEL TRILLING. MAY I ASK YOU WHAT YOU OBSERVED ON THE NIGHT IN QUESTION? I SAW A MAN CARRYING A LIGHTED TORCH TOWARDS THE PLANTATION. THAT MAN. AND, UH, HOW DID YOU RECOGNIZE THE DEFENDANT IN THE DARK? HE WAS WALKING WITH A COMMONER'S GAIT. AND DO YOU HAVE ANYONE TO CORROBORATE THIS STORY? UM... I--I THINK SO. YOU EITHER ARE EDWARD IVORY OR YOU'RE NOT. HE IS. I SAW, UH... "I SAW A MAN CARRYING A LIGHTED TORCH. THAT MAN." AND HOW DID YOU KNOW IT TO BE THE DEFENDANT? "HE WAS WALKING WITH A COMMUNIST GOAT." RIGHT. DEFENSE. YOU ARE AUNT TO MISS EMILY IVORY? AUNT? SHE'S MORE OF A MOTHER TO THE GIRL. THIS WOMAN IS A SAINT. SHE'S DEVOTED HER WHOLE LIFE TO THE UPBRINGING OF HER NIECE AND HER IDIOT NEPHEW, SELFLESSLY PUTTING THEIR HEALTH, THEIR HAPPINESS ABOVE HER OWN WOMANLY DESIRES AND URGES... AND NEEDS. I LOVE THIS WOMAN. NO FURTHER QUESTIONS. BUT, UH, I WOULD LIKE TO READ OUT THIS LETTER FROM HIS FATHER WHICH WILL SERVE AS A CHARACTER REFERENCE. "IF IT PLEASES YOUR WORSHIP, MY SON IS A SCUM." 10 YEARS. PLUS TWO FOR HAVING PLEADED NOT GUILTY. MAKING 13 YEARS IN ALL. Emily's voice: DEAREST GEORGE. I GAVE YOU MY HEART AND MY HYMEN, BUT I WOULD RATHER MARRY CEDRIC THAN GIVE BIRTH OUTSIDE OF WEDLOCK. ALTHOUGH YOU AND I CANNOT BE TOGETHER, I WILL ENSURE YOUR CHILD HAS THE BEST POSSIBLE UPBRINGING. I SHALL HAND THE BABY OVER TO YOUR FATHER-- NO! SELL IT TO PIRATES. ABANDON IT ON A MOUNTAIN. LET IT BE BROUGHT UP BY WOLVES. ANYTHING. SHALL I PRETEND IT IS CEDRIC'S, THEN? WILL YOU NOT WAIT FOR ME? ( sniffles ) DEAR, DEAR GEORGE. I'M BETROTHED TO POOR, POOR CEDRIC. NO. POOR, POOR GEORGE. I AM BETROTHED TO DEAR, DEAR CEDRIC. NO. POOR, DEAR GEORGE, I AM BETROTHED TO-- YOU DON'T LOVE HIM. I MAY NOT LOVE HIM, BUT HE IS PRESENTABLE. SO IT'S GOODBYE. I HATE SAYING GOODBYE. AU REVOIR. CIAO. SHALOM. SALAMU ALAIKUM. ( door opens, closes ) ( crying ) ( classical music playing ) ( exhales ) AgneHUDSON! WE'RE BACK! I SAY, BRING ALL THIS STUFF INDOORS, WILL YOU? THERE'LL BE A SIXPENCE IN IT FOR YOU. THERE'LL BE ONE EXTRA FOR DINNER! ( sighs ) ( man singing opera ) BLOODY FOOLS. ( cell door closes ) COME ON. NOW START UNDRESSING. ( moans ) START UNDOING THOSE, BUT KEEP-- YEAH-- NO, KEEP-- I'M AWFULLY SORRY. EXCUSE ME. OUT, SIR! OUT! OUT! ( both shouting ) OUT! OUT! GET OUT! IF YOU DON'T MIND. AAH! ( humming ) YOU LOOKING FORWARD TO TOMORROW, LAD? RATHER. I HAVEN'T HAD A GOOD BASH SINCE PATER'S FUNERAL. UH... I WISH THAT CEDRIC WAS MORE LIKE YOU. HE'S SUCH A QUEER FELLOW, AND YOU'RE ALWAYS SO GAY. OH, I DON'T THINK WE'RE SO VERY DIFFERENT. CEDRIC. DARLING. SOON WE'LL BE MAN AND WIFE. OR AS THE POET HOMER SAID-- ( screams ) EMILY. OH, AUNT AGNES, I HAD THE WORST NIGHTMARE! - SHH. - BUT HE-- - YOU'RE ALL RIGHT NOW. - HE WAS-- YOU'LL WAKE THE BABY. ( crying ) ( screams ) EMILY, WHAT'S THE MATTER? IT'S ALL RIGHT, DARLING. AUNT AGNES IS HERE. - ( choking) - WHAT? - I KNOW THIS ISN'T REAL. - WHAT? DON'T WORRY. IT'S JUST A DREAM. ( muffled screams ) ( screaming stops ) ( gasping ) SORRY, EVERYONE. HERE, PRETTY BUNNY. COME HERE, MY BEAUTY. SON! DAD. HMM. THERE YOU GO, SON. THERE'S NO PLEASING SOME PEOPLE. - DAD, JUST-- - DON'T "DAD" ME! THE SHAME YOU HAVE BROUGHT ON THIS HOUSEHOLD. ARSONIST. CONVICT. ESCAPEE. CONSORTING WITH PEOPLE ABOVE YOUR STATION. DAD, I AM GOING TO MARRY EMILY! YOUR MISS EMILY IS TO MARRY YOUNG MASTER CEDRIC. THIS VERY DAY. SHE DOESN'T LOVE HIM. ( scoffs ) WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT LOVE, YOU WORKING-CLASS BRUTE? LOVE KNOWS NO BOUNDS. ( muffled shouting ) I'VE NEVER HEARD SUCH CLAPTRAP. ( muffled shouting ) I HAVE SIRED A LUNATIC TO BE SURE. ( muffled shouting ) JUST A LITTLE SOMETHING FOR THE JOURNEY. IT'S TIME, DEAR. OH, YOU LOOK SO LOVELY. I'M SO HAPPY, I COULD CRY. OH, AUNT AGNES, JUST REMEMBER YOU'RE NOT LOSING A NIECE, YOU'RE GAINING A MAN WHO'S... AWFULLY GOOD AT CROQUET. AND WHO CAN PROBABLY GREET THE WEDDING GUESTS IN... GREEK, LATIN. SALVE. DELIGHTED TO MEET YOU. KALIMERA. AND HIEROGLYPHICS. HOW DO YOU DO? SALVE. GO, BOY! ( muffled shouting ) COME ON, YOU LITTLE SOD! I SAVED YOU! DAMN IT! BLAST! ( screams ) ( laughs ) CAPITAL. ON YOUR WAY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. LOOK, BUNNY, PLEASE, JUST CHEW THE BINDINGS. SALVE. - GOOD DAY. KALIMERA. HAVE YOU NEVER BEEN IN LOVE? PLEASE. PLEASE. GO ON. ...INTO WHICH HOLY ESTATE THESE TWO PERSONS PRESENT, THIS BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMAN WITH HER LOVELY COMPLEXION AND THIS MAN WITH HIS UNSIGHTLY FACIAL HAIR, COME NOW TO BE JOINED. THEREFORE, IF ANY MAN CAN SHOW ANY JUST CAUSE WHY THEY MIGHT NOT LAWFULLY BE JOINED TOGETHER, LET HIM NOW SPEAK OR ELSE HEREAFTER FOREVER HOLD HIS PEACE. FOR EXAMPLE, IF ANY MAN HAS PROOF THAT ONE OR OTHER OF THESE TWO PERSONS IS ALREADY MARRIED. OR DOES ANYBODY KNOW WHETHER ONE OR OTHER OF THEM HAS ANY DISGUSTING PERSONAL HABITS? OR PERHAPS ONE OF THEM HAS CAVORTED NAKED WITH THE DEVIL? NO? WELL, THEN... THERE'S NO RUSH. SURELY SOMEBODY HAS SOMETHING TO SAY. WE'RE JUST SO HAPPY TO BE HERE. - IT'S SO QUAINT. - IT'S JUST LIKE A FAIRY TALE. YOU LOOK A TREAT, LOVE, BUT GET ON WITH IT. STOP! SHE DOESN'T LOVE HIM! WELL, I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THAT'S A GOOD ENOUGH REASON. RIGHT. STAND BACK, EVERYONE. THIS MAN IS AN ESCAPED CONVICT. NO! LET HIM SPEAK. IF SHE MARRIES THAT UTTER COD SHE'LL REGRET IT FOR THE REST OF HER LIFE. Horace: YOU THINK SHE'LL MARRY YOU? A MAN WITHOUT A FAMILY MOTTO? AYE. YOU? YOU WHAT? HE WHAT? JUST AYE! I? I--I... YOU? YOU? OR DO YOU MEAN JUST YOU? I FEAR I MUST CONFESS SOMETHING. OH! OUT WITH IT! EDWARD AND I BORE FALSE WITNESS AGAINST GEORGE. WE DID IT, FRANKLY, BECAUSE WE HAVE THESE FEELINGS. THESE STRANGE FEELINGS. WE LOVE EACH OTHER! ( speaks Latin ) IT'S CALLED PROGRESS, DEAREST. PROGRESS? EMILY, WILL YOU MARRY ME? I'VE ALWAYS SAID THAT THE MAN THAT I MARRY MUST BE PERFECT IN EVERY WAY. Tweeb: I'M STILL A BACHELOR. YES, GEORGE. YES, I WILL MARRY YOU. STOP! YOU'RE TOO GOOD FOR HIM, LOVE! YOU'RE ALL FINE LINEN, LACE, AND SWEETNESS! HE'S JUST A-- GET A MOVE ON, VICAR.
