Once upon a time, long, long ago, this faraway land was ruled by the Tyrant Zubaid, with injustice and intimidation. One day, he went out deer hunting in the desert and his tyranny went too far, as he wanted to assault the women in Abu Mazen tribe. But they defended their honor and confronted him, killing the men and soldiers accompanying him. But he got away, with nothing on his mind but terrible revenge. Did you find him? We've searched everywhere but couldn't find him. That's a pity. He survived. Let's go. The powerful and filthy rich man escaped like a frightened goat. - Why are you so happy? - We defeated Zubaid the ruler. Did you catch him, or did he get away? Is he dead or alive? Alive. He's very much alive, wiseman of the Arabs. Peace be upon you, Abu Mazen tribe... Haggag, let go of the stubbornness and rage and listen to the wise man of the Arabs. Why don't you go to his house and try to appease him? - Me! - Men more powerful... than you couldn't get to him. He's stubborn and mighty. - What about my reputation and honor? - What about your own people? In the morning, take a box of precious pearls and extravagant Sindhi silk cloth. And go with the leaders of Abu Mazen tribe to meet him. Tell him you've come seeking protection. And urge him to put the past behind us. What do you think of what the wise man of the Arabs said? The wise man of the Arabs is and old fool. Don't listen to him, Haggag. Stay out of politics, politics is for men, Thurayya. This is foolishness, not politics. Why should he go? - What could happen? - They'll kill him! That's enough, Thurayya. I've decided to go. You'll walk straight through hell... and regret won't take things back. - Stop worrying, Thurayya. - What's going to happen to you? I'll send my son Essam with Haggag. - Essam? - Yes. Suit yourselves! My son Essam will be the first to go with you. Essam! Essam! Essam! Stop! Stop, Zayyan! Where's Essam? I don't know, wise man. You're his friend but you don't know? I know where to find him. With the Gypsies! ♪ Gypsies! Gypsies! ♪ Gypsies! Gypsies! ♪ Gypsies! Gypsies! ♪ Gypsies! Gypsies! ♪ Gypsies! Gypsies! ♪ Gypsies! Gypsies! ♪ Gypsies!

Then you'll be ready in the morning to go with the delegates. - But I don't want to go. - Great! Now they'll say the son of the wise man is a coward. No one dares say that about me! Then you must go with the delegates. Forgive me, father. I don't like crazy people. That's an order! And don't you dare bail on them. - Do you want me to go in your place? - That'd be great! - You'll be doing me a big favor. - On one condition! We'll both accept your conditions. Make me a bowl of porridge - the way Gypsies cook it. - Consider it done. The porridge I make is like nothing you've tasted before. We have a deal! Zayyan, don't be long. - Goodbye. - Don't be long, son. Goodbye! Essam, there's Zayyan. - Where are you going? - We want to meet Ruler Zubaid. - And who might you be? - The leaders of Abu Mazen tribe. Open the doors. - Reaper! Nohal! - Here, my Lord! - Here, my Lord! - And you, what's your name? - Tha'alaba, my Lord. - Yes, Tha'alaba. Come here and don't go out to meet them. Come! Come here! The powerful and influential Haggag has come here! He came voluntarily, Hanzala. Open the doors for him! The brave Haggag! We've erred, my Lord and we've seeking forgiveness and amnesty. I should forgive and put the past behind us, correct? These humble gifts are for you. Roll out the amber carpets Put up the Esfahan chandeliers! Bring out the censers! Invite the leaders of tribes and clans to witness my huge celebration! Of the powerful Haggag! - Hanzala, Hanzala! - My Lord. These are the leaders of clans. I don't see the Sheikh of Bani Nu'man. Where is he? - I invited him but he didn't come. - Why? Too proud to come? Is he disobedient, Hanzala? Battah I know, my Lord. - I'll teach him a lesson. - Don't come back emptyhanded. I'll bring back the most beautiful Gazelle. Is that so, Battah? Very well! - My people! - Yes. I'm going to tell you a story. Listen up, Haggag listen up, leaders of the clans. A lion once got into a neighborhood looking for a prey. He heard a turkey gobbling a sound that irritated him, so he ran away. The calves thought the lion was running away from them, so they followed him. He ran and they went after him he kept running and they kept following him. Why are you running after him? They said he's a lion with four legs. But we're five claves with twenty legs and ten horns! Four calves and one big bull. Four calves and a big bull. Bring out the plates! Tell me, Haggag. Tell me. What should he do with them? - Should he eat them alive? - If killing will satisfy him. - Shed their blood? - If that will warm his heart. But your meat is stinky and your blood is bad! I'll cut you into pieces and feed you to the dogs, you bastards! Cut off their hands! That's your punishment! That's the punishment of those who challenge me! Get them out! Get them all out! Your day will come, you ragtag and bobtail! Your day will come, too. You lived like a tyrant and you've killed innocent men. Be careful. The people won't tolerate injustice much longer. You'll never touch it before Zayyan comes back. Where are you Zayyan? Won't you come back, Zayyan? There he is. The leaders the tribe are getting killed, and you're sitting here playing with frond. Like Shaden taught you! I killed him. It's my fault! I must avenge his death. I must fight Zubaid! Fight him? With what? With the knitted frond? Zubaid will find this knitted frond wherever he goes. I'll get my revenge! Let's gather the men of the tribe. They'll be folding their tents and getting ready to leave. They'll leave their homes and lands? How could they? So that Zubaid won't come back to kill them and kidnap their women. - Where are you going? - To gather the tribes - and retaliate against Zubaid. - Let me come with you. Whenever you need me, send me a signal with the knitted frond. Why are you folding the tents? Abed, where are you going? Sit, sit! Ajeb, Tareq. Talal, this is our land! How could we leave it? Essam, my son Zayyan is dead. He was your friend and he liked you very much. God bless you, son. God bless you. - Father. - We're determined to leave. How can we leave? We must retaliate and protect our produce. Save your courage, Essam, you're all brave and enthusiastic! There are no men left in Abu Mazen tribe to take revenge... - Don't say that! - Enough then! Come on! Let's go, people! Let's go. He's a tyrant. No one can stand up to him. God will help me stand up to him. I'm coming for him, this treacherous. - So I won't see you again? - If I'm alive, you'll find me with the help of the knitted frond. You'll go back to Shaden who taught you about the frond? The time to fool around is gone. - Essam, Essam! - Did you find water? - What water? There's a disaster! - What? Look! This Bedouin is from Bani Nu'man tribe. Zubaid's soldiers will kill him. - Follow me, Bunduq. - Follow you? Leave him alone! You're the son of the wise man of the Arabs Taking up a sword? And I'll never put it down after today. Do you know me now, brave soldier? You know me now? They robbed us. Save Bani Nu'man. - Where to? - Bani Nu'man. - Goodbye. - Will you go with me? - Go with you? Sure. - Why hide your face? So they wouldn't recognize me and retaliate against Bani Mazen. - Got it? - Not really. My daughter! - What's the matter? - My daughter... Dalal! - Calm down. - Don't tell me to calm down. - Bring me back my daughter. - Where is she? She was taken by Battah and she's my only daughter. Bunduq, take them to the cave at Ain Ez-Zahra - until I come back. - Where are you going? To meet Battah and get the girl back. - Battah! - What's the matter? She scratched me! She is a monster! Don't be afraid. I'm here so you won't feel lonely. - Get away from me. - I said don't be afraid. Get away from me! - Get away! - Don't be afraid. Hit me! - Get away from me! - Hit me! Scratch me! You steal men's heart! She scratched him! Get up and come with me. Battah is injured and the girls is gone! Come on, let's go! Let's go! They killed Essam for rescuing your daughter. What should I do with you now? Look! It's Dalal. - Essam! - Dalal! - Essam! Essam! - My daughter! Dalal! You saved her, stranger! You saved her! He's neither stranger nor a loved one. How can I thank you? Don't worry about. I've done nothing. You brought me back my daughter! I'm alive again! How can I reward you? Alas! You've got nothing to reward him with. Your smile will appease him and a glance from you at him is enough. Bunduq likes to make jokes. Don't be angry. - I'm not angry. - Thank you, Dalal! - Bunduq, they want to go to sleep. - I don't feel like sleeping. - She doesn't feel like sleeping. - No more jokes, Bunduq! Come with me. Why is he masked and hiding his face? He's afraid to be seen. But I'd love to see him. - Bunduq. - What? We must disrupt the ruler's plot against the Bedouins. We must. We must know what he's up to everyday. We must. We must send someone to the city to find what out what's happening. - We must. - Only you can do that, Bunduq. - You'll leave in the morning. - I must. Wait, what? - No, I don't want to. - You must. - Must I? - Yes. So be it! Come here, Hanzala. - Who is that? - Battah. Battah? - He was killed. - How? How was he killed? Tell me! This is really bad! My Lord, Battah is here. Mr. Minister, you want me to get excited! Tell me the good news you have. - Tell him, Diyab. - My Lord, Bani Nu'man... Yes, I know. You've slaughtered them and taught them a lesson. Where are their spoils and money? Where's the beautiful woman that infatuated all men? - Tell me about her. Tell me! - My Lord... - My Lord, Battah was killed. - What? What an idiot. A great soldier like him ought to know how to defend himself in a fight. He was killed by an unknown after he captured a heavenly beautiful girl. Where is she? Where is she? The Devil took her and we don't know how. How come you don't know? You're all a bunch of idiots. He's not human! He killed Battah and we didn't see him. He only left this knitted frond behind. - What frond? - Knitted frond. He didn't find the money we took, though. - Where is it, give it to me. - This pouch of money - is far from enough... - Yes, it is. Give it to me. You, Reaper, go to the tribes first thing in the morning - to collect the money. - We collect money in the Spring. - What? - This is not Spring. You're joking? Tomorrow begins Spring. - Reaper! - Yes, My Lord. Arrange for a cockfight and a bet on this pouch of money. Bring out the cocks! And bring me that devil. I'll shove this frond up his throat. All these wars, raids, killings, and stealing. Just for the money. But where does the money go? Come on! Come on! Come on! That's not a cock! That's an ass! My Lord... Here goes the pouch of money You've lost the bet! Well done, Bunduq. How did you find out all of this? It's like art! - But this time they almost got me! - Why? - It's the reaper! - I'll reap his soul! - Come on, Bunduq. - Wait! Let me eat first! Bunduq! Don't go, Essam. Don't risk your life. There's too many of them. Nothing will stop me from getting what I want. Essam, don't leave us behind. I don't want to leave you, Dalal. But I do today is for a greater goal! - Essam, let me go with you. - Go with me? - I'll help you. - Help me how? Will you fight? Let's go, Bunduq. My dear, women are not meant to take up swords. Swords and blood are not enough. This requires cunning and trickery. - Trickery? - That's what women are good at! Why have you forgotten about her? Today is her day! Today is her day! - Today is her day! - Who are you talking about? - Shaden! - Shaden? She's the queen of Gypsies She's full of tricks and magic. And she loves you. She'll never disobey you. Fine. Prepare the horses and we'll go get her. What's wrong, Dalal? She's worried about you, my boy. But you... Dalal... I know why you don't want me to go with you. I fear for you, Dalal. - You fear for me? - You don't believe me? - No, I don't. - Why not? Because until now you won't let me see your face. All in good time. - Essam, Essam. - What is it, Dalal? Take this. A charm to bring you luck and protect you from enemies. Reveal the truth to me, My precious seashells, and put my mind at ease. When will my lover come back? Tell me where my lover is. Right in front of you. Essam isn't coming back. My seashells tell me he's coming back today. Shaden, don't let your charm go too far. ♪ This charm originates from the mountains ♪ Our eyes are as beautiful as the deer's ♪ This charm originates from the mountains ♪ Our eyes are as beautiful as the deer's. ♪ - He's not coming back! - He is! Essam! I've missed you! Stop! Damn you! Stop! Stop, Gypsy girl! Leave some for the reaper! Get up and just stop! Essam! Essam! Essam! Where have you been? - Listen to me, Shaden. - What? - I want to trick the Reaper. - And his gang! And take all the money he's got. We need the money! I don't care about the money. Very well!

The masked man with the knitted frond! - Where is he? - He's inside. Let's go. Love is so sweet! Do you hear that? No! - What's this? - This is how your life will end! Shaden, run! Use the knitted frond to find me! I want to tell you something, and it's serious. What is it? It's about the masked man with the knitted frond. - Get in the water! - What? - What happened? - My Lord, I'm afraid to say. What? My Lord, Nohal knows all about it. Get him here. Nohal! Nohal! - Come here! - What are you saying? This is water! - Come in here! Now! - I can't swim, my Lord. The masked man killed the Reaper! What? The masked man killed the Reaper! And before that he killed Battah! He's going to kill all of you! There will be no one left to protect me! I no longer have men nor soldiers! You do, my Lord! You've always had them! - What are you saying? - We'll trick him, my Lord! Come here! Tell me what you mean! - Get in the water! - In the water? Tell me how do you plan to defeat them? - This is the secret! - What are you talking about? Send an army with me, I'll bring back the masked man, alive and humiliated. - What? - I swear on my life! - They'll be more knitted frond. - Just one. And you'll see with your own eyes the body of the masked man. Knitted frond from Shaden? She must be missing Essam and wants to see him. - Is it too heavy? - No. Let me help you! - Thanks for the help! - I've made it worse! - Sit down. Are you cold? - No. God bless you, Essam. Do you worry about me? - You can't imagine, Dalal. - I can't tell you how happy I am - because... - Because I worry about you? Dalal, you know very well that my life isn't worth much to me. Time isn't on my side after today. Happiness is short-lived and I'll live with that. - Dalal, close your eyes. - Why? Do it for me. Essam! Essam! - Knitted frond from Shaden. - Your timing couldn't be worse, She must be missing you. - Dalal. - What do you want? - Dalal! - Don't waste time. Dalal, I want to tell you... Go to her before her burning love destroys you. Don't waste time, Essam. We must leave now. The ruler wants him alive. Don't kill him. Circle around him but don't kill him! The ruler wants him alive! We've been betrayed. It's an ambush! - Surrender or I'll kill you! - You're welcome to try! Are you blind? Look around you. Fighting won't do you any good. - He's right, Essam! - You're a coward. I won't surrender. - It's a tough spot we're in. - Shut up, Bunduq. - Look! - Did they leave? - We've got help! - Where? - I'm going down there. - Don't be crazy. A storm coming. So what? I'm going down there. If we could stall them until the storm hits... Hey, masked man! - What do you want? - If you don't surrender right now, - we'll attack! - And if I surrender? The ruler will decide what to do with you. But Zubaid is cruel and can't be trusted. Don't waste our time. I'm warning you. If you don't surrender, I'll cut you into pieces! Are you going to surrender or not? It's close. It's a storm! Nobody leaves! Stay where you are! Get back here! It's the end of the masked man! Come back! Come back! Finish it, put a knitted frond on him. Tha'laba! - Rejoice, my Lord! - He's dead. When will Nohal die? No man amongst you is brave enough. I'll teach all of you a lesson! My Lord, it's the masked man who died. - What? - He was buried under the storm. - What are you saying? - Rejoice, my Lord! He's dead! He's dead! The masked man is dead! He's dead! He's dead! Prepare a funeral for Tha'laba and arrange for a celebration! No more frond! - Hanzala! Nohal! - My Lord. - He's dead! - Yes! Why are still standing here? Get ready for the hunting. Prepare the men. Prepare the horses and get ready to go out hunting today. Come on! It must be difficult to wait for your lover! But's so sweet when you finally see him! - If only he'd come back! - Shut up! He'll be back. He's gone and never coming back. - You're wrong. - Shaden. You've taught him to communicate with this knitted frond. - He threw one today. - So what? He's no longer competing against me over your love. What did you do? Do you know Tha'laba? You told him where Essam was? I told him about communicating through this. Traitor! Watch it, Shaden! Are you crying because I loved you? Stop it, Tameem! That's enough! I'll kill whoever even glances at you and cut off the hand that points at you! You're strong and fearless, that's what I like. Really, Shaden? You are a Rat! Essam. He'll be fine, guys. Give him some space. - What are you going to do? - I'll treat your wounds. - Give it to Bunduq. - I'm just like your mother! No! No! Give it to Bunduq. That's the doing of your sweetheart Shaden. Whom rushed to see. I don't believe it was Shaden. Hey, be careful! Who else knows about that place? - How could she do this? - Because she loves you so much! Forget about Shaden. You won't even let us see your face. - Where is he injured, Bunduq? - Don't be angry, Dalal. - I'm not angry. - This charm saved me. No! I saved you! Don't get upset. Both of you did! - Essam! Essam! - That's Shaden. Tell her to come, Bunduq. - Essam! Essam! - Where are you going? - There's no place for me here. - Don't say that! Dalal, are you leaving me when I'm wounded? Shaden will do a better job treating your wound. Essam, my love... I've missed you! I was worried about you! - Shaden! - Essam, my love! - Shaden! - Where were you injured? Shaden, who threw the knitted frond and ambushed us? You fool. It was Tameem who betrayed you and I killed him. You killed him? I'll get some herbs to treat you. - Where are you going? - Watch it! Essam is here, but your mother is over there. It doesn't concern you if I go to Essam or to my mother! - Essam is off limits! - You don't own him! - But I won't let him go! - I'll tell him about this! What's going on, Dalal? Nothing, I was going to get some water. - Shaden, I'm going to the city. - Essam, take me with you! No, go back to the Gypsies. Go with her, Bunduq. - What about our agreement? - After I'm done with Zubaid. - What? - Come on, go! Dalal, aren't you going to say goodbye? Stay safe. Leaders of the clans! I risked my life to bring back your money! But I can't fight alone anymore. Tell us what you want, stranger! I want us to be united and fight Zubaid together! We're with you! How do we fight the ruler's huge army? My brothers, I'm going to the city to pave the way. You prepare the men, the horses, and the weapons. And on the big souq day, I'll give you the signal to attack! Very well, young people! - What's the signal? - A flag. I'll light it on fire and hold it on a poll. The big souq's day! Watch out for the signal! Let's go, people! Let's go! - What did you do, Bunduq? - I took Shaden back to the Gypsies. On the way, I saw Zubaid going out hunting at Wadi Al-Ghezlan. - Very good. - I'm going to meet him. Well done, my Lord. Excellent aim! Sure! - Who is that? Hey! You! - What? - That's my deer. - Your deer? - Yes. It's not yours. - I'm telling you it's mine! - Don't be stubborn, boy! - Shut up! I hit it! No! No! I hit it! - You? - Are you crazy, boy? - Didn't I hit it, Hanzala? - Right in the heart, my Lord! You're a bunch of liars and hypocrites! Are you insulting my Lord? - Listen, boy! - I said shut up! - Get Nohal, Hanzala! - Nohal! I'll get angry! - You're the Ruler? - Yes! You don't look like a ruler! - I wish it was this horse! - Why? So I can tell him how stupid and clueless he is! He surrounds himself with an entourage of stupid men. They're keeping everything from him. They don't tell him how to live and have fun! - How to laugh his heart out! - And you know how to do that? Wait! Listen up! Let's say I'm the ruler. Tell me how you're going to do it, and I'll meet you. - Get off your horse? - What did you say to me? - Get off your horse! - All right! Don't get upset. I'm getting off! Listen to what I'm going to tell you. - Here you go. - Thank you, son. I'm all yours, my Lord. I want to reward you. Tell me what you wish for? - Let me be one of your soldiers. - A Soldier? - We don't know anything about him. - Test me! - Test him! - What do you want? Send him out to collect money and spoils. - From where, Hanzala? - From the Gypsies, my Lord. They're ruthless! No one can take them down! - I can! - You're a Bedouin! - My sword can't be broken! - Give him soldiers. He's a stranger to the soldiers! How are they supposed to obey him? Leave him Essam! That's enough! Give him some army uniform. He should leave in the morning. I'll come back bearing gifts and gratuities! And Nohal, my Lord. We need to dispatch him in the morning. - Where to? - To Ain As-Sakhrah to bring a gift worthy of you, my Lord.

I don't want to hear anything about him! He must've upset you when he took you away from Battach, right? - He didn't dare touch me! - Even better! Very well, Dalal. Tell us where he is. How does he look like? - I don't know. - How so? He was masked. - That's true, How could she know? - Should I do my tricks - and tell you where he is right now? - Very well. My precious seashells tell us his whereabouts! - Oh dear God! - What is it? A lion with big claws and fangs! That would be me! Continue... - He's confronted with a fox. - That's the masked man! He's right in front of you! Should I say more? That's enough, my Lord! I'm tired and I want to go to sleep. - Good God! - What is it? - His lover is suffering! - Who's that? His other girlfriend! Damn her! She's in love with him and they're plotting something together! His first girlfriend, though, gets it and won't let this go, do you hear? - I'm not deaf, you know! - You didn't come here to hear about the masked man's love affairs, my Lord! - You're the best lover there is! - Go away! - And the fortune telling? - I don't want it! - But it's happening tonight! - What is? He's meeting his first girlfriend tonight, do you hear me? I'm not deaf, you damn Gypsy! Get out! Go! - Should I close the door? - It is guarded. - Dalal. - My Lord. You little devil, come here. - Forget the fortune telling. - Tell me what you wish for. What do you want? - Leave me. - What? - I'm upset. - I miss you. Don't rush it. I gave you my heart and I want yours. Don't fool me. You just want my body, not my soul. And I want your soul before your body. I want our love to thrive and lovers to swear by it! And how do we do that? Give me some time to test you before I give myself to you. What are you talking about? Just until the big souq day. What do you say? My happiness will be doubled, my Lord. You want me to leave? Is that an order? If you love me, then yes, it's an order. I can't say No to you. But what if I die before that time? No, I'm not going to die. I must be out of my mind to do all of this. Am I doing it for you? Yes, that's right. Dalal is beautiful and you want her. But you need me so you keep me close. Like a slave. Me and my people. She's a princess and you're a knight. And we're slaves. - That's what I get for loving you. - Shaden I didn't tell you to love me. And because I loved you, you'll just take what you want and abandon me? Who do you think you are? You're nothing! You're not rich or handsome! - Damn you, Gypsy girl! - I wish you'd die! - You want to kill me? - And cut you into pieces. - You traitor! - You're acting like a kid! Sit. I've come up with a good plan. And I want your help. We'll take Zubaid down. Listen to me carefully. This is the city. I want to throw the knitted frond to the west of the city. Go now, quick! - And what's next? - There'll be justice for all. - What about me? - We'll talk about that later. Dalal would've had taken you from me! - I told you you're being silly! - Essam! Throw the frond first thing in the morning! - Essam! - What? Nothing. My fellow men! Today is the big souq day! Get ready! Come on! Get ready, men! Come on! Let's go! - We will meet there. - Why didn't you say? Don't you know that Abu Mazen tribe wants to retaliate? Prepare your men, wise man of the Arabs. And wait with us for the signal by the masked man. - He never breaks his promise! - I'm ready! This girl is so fine, Hanzla! My Lord! My Lord! What is it, Essam? - This is the big souq day! - And I'm here to keep my promise. - Where is the masked man? - I know where he is. - He was seen west of the city... - Two miles away... - Two miles? - Go after it, Essam. I want the army to accompany me. He has many followers. Are you sure of his location or did they fool you? My Lord! My Lord! The frond, my Lord! We've spotted the knitted frond west of the city, two miles away. - Didn't I tell you, my Lord? - Go on then, Essam. Let the entire army escort him. Go, Essam and bring back the masked man right away! Go get him, Essam! Quick, Essam! My Lord I'm worried that he might get away. You're stupid! He'll come back to get his sweetheart! And I must let the army go with him, so he wouldn't know I'm onto him. Got it? What about the appointment? I know what I am doing. Come on, get the army. Go on, now. Well done, my dear. Well done. Salma, what brings you here? It's good that you still remember me. Come here. What do you want? I'm not here to beg you for anything. I told you years ago You're no match for me anymore. That doesn't concern me at all... I'm here to look for Dalal. - Dalal? - Dalal, my daughter whom was taken by your men. - Dalal is your daughter? - And yours, too, you ungrateful man! Dalal is my daughter? Come with me! Set up the tents here until I come back. - Where are you going, Essam? - I'll be waiting for the masked man. Goodbye and good luck! - Do you see my beautiful bride? - Go wait outside. - Dalal! Dalal! - Come in! Dalal told me to take you to her quick! She'll come right away. Essam, come here! Come over here, Essam! Come over here, Essam! Show me the masked man! Hurry! What's wrong, Essam? You've returned empty-handed like the knights before you? Who is this masked man? Don't worry. There's still only one man left who's capable of taking him down. And it's me, I'm Zubaid. Do you hear me, Mr. clever masked man with the frond? You bastard! Capture him! Take his beautiful faithful bride too. Throw them in the...well! Go! Essam, I was a terrible man and I've committed all kinds of sins. - But Dalal... my daughter. - Dalal is your daughter? It's killing me, Essam. Please help me. I'll lose my daughter! - Zubaid is crazy! Please save her! - It's too late, Hanzala. - No, Essam. - How? - Bargain with Zubaid. - About what? Zubaid still doesn't know the signal. Bargain with him for my daughter's sake! He'll want to know the signal so he'd wipe out the tribes when they attack. All right. I'll tell him. The army is still far away from the Palace and we still have a chance to win! Take me to him, Hanzala. Show me no mercy in front of him so he won't know what we're up to. Hanzala! Come up here and bring Essam, too! Talk, you bastard! So that the tribes would attack and walk into an ambush? - Talk! - I'm not talking! - You're not talking? - My Lord. Essam, how could you let Dalal suffer, if you two love each other? She's innocent! Save her life, Essam! - Tell us what the signal is. - Leave him to me. - I hate you! - You're a traitor! You started it, you ungrateful! I'm waiting! My Lord, he won't say a word. Burn his eyes. Cut out his heart! - My Lord! - Come on! Say it! Let Dalal go. Release her and I'll tell you what the signal is. No, Essam, don't tell them! Don't! Take her to a horse and I'll tell you. Do as he says! - Talk! - Take me to the tower. Take him! Get me a torch. The signal! Come on! Prepare to attack! My Lord, I've prepared the army and they're ready now. - Good. - And the knights are ready. - Good! - They're waiting for the signal so they'd destroy the tribes when they attack. We won't leave a living person behind. We'll attack them everywhere! Take him away! To the fight! To the fight! Here's your sword, Essam. If we could distract the army after Nohal has brought it back... That would be the only solution. - Nohal! - I've been an idiot! A fool! You two are cowards and traitors! Put on Nohal's clothes and distract the cavalry. I'll handle the soldiers stationed at the towers and walls. No one knows that Zubaid captured me. Soldiers! Follow me! All of you! Come on! Come on! Go inside! All of you! Go inside, come on! It's a dead end! Come here you worthless bastards! Come to me! Kill them! Slay them! Where's the army? Where are the soldiers? Where's Hanzala? Where are the men? Where's the army? Where's the army? My beloved people! What are you doing? That's inappropriate! I'm the ruler! I'm Zubaid! Go back to your tribes and let's work in peace! - I'm the ruler! I'm the ruler! - Come on! I know what you want but you'll never get it! No one can touch me! Never! Come with me, come with me! We could live down here. We've got enough money to live a thousand years! I don't care about anyone! I'm the ruler! How dare the tribes attack me? Damn them all! Essam! Essam! - Essam! Essam! - Don't come near me! One step and I'll throw her in the well. My Lord, I don't mean you any harm.
