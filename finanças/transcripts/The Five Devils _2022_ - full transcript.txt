Vicky, come say hello to your father. Day. Why do you smell like that? -I sort them. You sort them? By scent? What do you smell? Not so much. -Eyes closed. It smells like mold and it also smells like... ...mushroom. And you can smell the animal that ate it. A rat or a squirrel, I don't know. You recognize the breath of a rat or a squirrel? Yes. Eyes closed. What do you smell? -Cookies. That was a breeze. Keep your eyes closed. And this? Plastic that smells a bit like earth. And this? A book that smells like the swimming pool. And a little bit of coffee. Do you smell me too? Sure. Wait. Eyes closed. You don't see anything? do you smell me now? -At two meters. Now you count to twenty and you're going to look for me. One two Three... ...four five six... ...16, 17, 18, 19, 20. Mom? -Yes? I found you. I'll be right back. That is Pleebrush's mother. -Hey, Ragebol. Are you afraid?

She's eight. Forward. Tell. Say, honey? Are you going to play there? What's the problem? Your flame sprinkler? Dad... What then? -Vicky. What is it? She has a very weird sense of smell. Your daughter lives in her own world. She's not sick. What does Jimmy say? -She would put her in therapy right away. I do not want that. How's Jimmy? What does that mean? do you fuck? -Dad... Still not? -I'm not discussing this with you. With whom? Your girlfriends? You don't have that. The only one you have is so retarded like what. That's no use to you. There you have it too. Listen. Every evening around the same time he is at the door. And every night I feed him tuna. Delicious canned tuna. Is he crazy about. I also gave him roast beef once. No. Check it out, old man. Shouldn't he have any of it. But this... I know there are people who are hungry suffering, but I just like it. Are you pouring something? -Naturally. But what am I supposed to do? Buy a nice set, something seductive. Something your body shows, instead of a hobo bag. You leave that little one with me and you settle a nice evening together with your husband. Under each other or on top of each other. Eat, Vicky. I don't like canned green beans. I hate that smell. Should I have picked them in the garden? Everything fine? Empty your plate. Okay. Naturally. Rue des Lilas 14. See you tomorrow. Who was that? Juliet. You don't mean that, do you? Why 'see you tomorrow'? How so? I really don't like that. How did you come up with that? I don't want it. This is the guest room but we don't often have guests. They belong to Vicky, do you mind? -Of course not. What happened? -I was drunk and I fell. It's nothing serious. Vicky, help me. Sorry, she would clean up. Do you need anything else? -Can I take a shower? Naturally. -Can I borrow some of Joanne's clothes? I'll ask her. Thank you for the ticket. That really touched me. I'm glad you called. I'll get you clothes. She smells like alcohol. Peat fired whisky. -What do you know about peat-fired whisky? Is she your little sister or your big sister? - My sister. Why doesn't she have an accent? -She was born in France, just like you. I was already old when I came from Senegal. But we partly grew up here together. Why didn't I know her yet? -We lost track of each other. That sometimes happens when you grow up. How long had you not seen her? Ten years. A conference about what? -Nanotechnology. What is that? It's me. And what is your field? -Bio nanotechnology. I deal with neurons. Piece of pie? No idea what happened to me meringue, but it's different than usual. Very tasty. -Real? MERRY CHRISTMAS GREETINGS FROM THE SOLER FAMILY I hope you're well. Let's call soon. Love, Jimmy. Are you OK? I want her to go. I'm not taking this. Girls, wait. -Hurry up, Nadine. It's cold.

This is important. Especially with the Christmas gala coming up. It's no contest, but it is for the public. Joanne, are you taking off those dangles? That? -You creoles. Not gymnastics. -I like them. You take them off. -They look good on me. You take them off. OK, let's start. Oh dear. Didn't forget anything? Buckle up. Come quickly, Vicky. -Kiss, honey. It is my fault. Sorry. I'll show you. Look. Don't laugh, huh? OK, there it goes. One two Three. Nice. Nice? -Yes. Thank you. Your sister said you're in the fire department? How beautiful. Got it from your girlfriend? -Nadine, do you have cigarettes? And thanks. -Sorry. I do have a lighter. So you thought we were worthless? -It wasn't great. You mean bad? -It was a bit of a flop. I am very good at massaging. -Go ahead. Julia, what's wrong? Julia, calm down. What did you do to her? -Nothing. I massaged her, that's all. It's happening again, Jimmy. -I am with you. There's no one there, just us. Psycho. Damn. Is she with you? Who? -Julia. No. You don't do that to me, do you? -No. That's my father. She's been coming to the pub for two evenings. Who says that? -Everyone knows that. Not me. And Jimmy knows nothing? -No. Did you know that the total mass of ants on earth... ...larger... ...than the total mass of people on earth? I did not know that. -I saw that the other day. A documentary. I did not know what I saw. I'm telling you this because you're my buddy but I hear everything. You know what the people are like here. Some things make them real not happy. And then they can go far. Why 'far'? To threaten? No, but you know how it is. People talk. They talk. What is your sister doing here? My sister has been tried, she has been treated and things are better now. She doesn't care. If they want to say something they come to me. GREEN SOAP Pleebrush. -Redball. Let me go. -What is that? Mold. -Where did you get that again? No, not my jars. -Get, how gross. An egg from the cafeteria? That brings me to an idea. She can eat him. -Pinch her nose. You're stupid and a weird troll, toilet brush, mop. Green soap? We're going to rinse her mouth. Open. Vicky, did you play with a scarf? Did you strangle them? Answer. What kind of game did you play? What happened? Are you OK? What's going on? Grab your bag. -Mrs. Soler, we were waiting for you. We found these children unconscious and we want to know what happened. It was Pleebrush. -Redball. Say, talk normally. Just tell the principal. Who did this? Vicky, did you hurt Lilou? - Say, act normal. Let her answer. -No. What do you mean 'Pleebrush, Ragebol'? I'm asking your daughter something. Can't she answer? -No, I'm here. I ask what. They were unconscious. I want to know why. Me too. - She can talk, right? Me too. -I'm asking her something. That can also be done differently. Of course, dude. Just walk away. It's coming still before the juvenile judge, that girl. The apple doesn't fall far from the tree. Bitch. Bitch. - What did she say there? Bitch. -You are insane. I didn't strangled them. I hope so, say. That is also possible. Why 'Toothbrush'? Do they often tell you that? You have to tell me, Vicky. Otherwise I can't help you. Grandpa. -Tell them I'm not here. Give me your mother. -She's not here. Does your cart drive itself then? Give her a minute or I'll cut your ears off. Here, mom. Grandpa. Yes? -Come here tonight. We have to talk. Another time this week. Can't tonight. - Honey, I'm worried about you. Is that lesbian pyromaniac with you? From Sunday morning thunderstorms towards Provence. Vicky, come and help. -I'm busy. PYROMANIAC Someone who has an irrepressible urge to arson. Can I do something? -No thanks. I'll be fine.

Will you keep my kitchen intact? Are you alright? Or am I interrupting? -We're working. Joanne, get dressed. -I'm dressed. Now. Have you known each other for a long time? -Since September.

What are you doing? -I have to leave. Why? -Otherwise I'll miss the last bus. Wait. I have to get out of here. -Why? Everyone thinks I'm crazy. -No. You think so too. -What? That's not true at all. I'm not crazy. I see it right? Then what do you see? - You don't understand. If you don't try, do not you know that. I see a little girl. And she scares you? Yes. If you're scared, Shall we leave together then? I have thought about it. We can to Marseilles. To my friend Fanny. Stop that nonsense. -No nonsense. I've got it all figured out.

To prevent heat loss. A second skin against the cold. You have the stopwatch and the whistle. After 20 minutes you whistle and I'll be back. Longer is still too dangerous. How dangerous? Then your muscles relax... ...you get sleepy and eventually your heart stops. That's why I need someone. Why are you doing that to yourself? -What? That icy water. I like it. Why are you back?
