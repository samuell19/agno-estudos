"For centuries theologians, philosophers and poets have delved into the universe in search of proof of the existence of the devil. It would have sufficed to look into the depths of their own souls." Hieronimus A. Steinback XVII Century Damn light! Mike! Let go of her! Michael, let go of her! Good. Scene three, shot five. He nearly killed her. She had a bad fright. Drink some of this. - Feel better now? - Yes. Thankfully that was the last shot. Good. That scene was truly exceptional. It seemed like you really wanted to kill her. Hello. Yes, it's me. Pack a suitcase, we're going. Don't worry, just get ready. I'll be there in an hour. Bye. You say it's an irresistible impulse, but it looks like you're running away. Is it strange that I want to see my mother after fifteen years? - No, but... - Besides, a holiday in Surrey, away from the city, in my mother's house will do you good. At least that's what I think. Don't you agree? But weren't you meant to speak to Hans about your new film? He's meeting us there. Did he have an irresistible impulse too? No, I called him. Do you mind if we listen to the radio? Watch out! - Can you hear music? - It must be the wind. - It looks like nobody's here. - You should have phoned. Beep the horn. What do you want? I'm Michael Stanford. I'll be down at once. Of course. I still recognize you, you're Oliver. Well? Why are you looking at me like that? Forgive me, sir. It's incredible how much you resemble the maestro, your father. How's my mother? Madam has always hoped that one day you'd return. But obviously not tonight. She was very tired and went to bed early. Don't disturb her, I'll see her in the morning. Bring in the rest of the bags later. Debora Jordan, my girlfriend. As far as mother is concerned, she's my secretary. Why the lantern? For some time now, just a little rain or wind and the electricity goes. Tell me, Oliver... I thought I heard music when we arrived. It's not possible. Not one note has been heard in this house since maestro's death. One thing. Your mother is very sick, and she doesn't want you to know. Give me your bag, I'll carry it. These are your mother's living quarters. This was your father's room. And now, if I may, I'll show the young lady to her room. I'll see you in a while. You can make yourself comfortable here, miss. - Who sleeps in there? - No one, it was maestro's study. It has been closed up since the day of his death. Call me if you need anything. I sleep upstairs, near the attic. You'll find some candles on the table. Mother! Michael! Finally! You've come back. - What's wrong? - Nothing, it's nothing. I'm overcome with emotions. See, you brought the light back to this house. Hold me tight. Oliver told me that... Pay no attention to him. He exaggerates. He's always talking too much. Poor Oliver. I don't know what I'd have done without him. But now everything will be different. You're here now. Michael! Mother, this is Debora. My secretary. My compliments, she's nice. If you want to go downstairs Oliver will have prepared something. See you tomorrow. Aren't you eating? What's wrong with you? Should I be happy? Your mother isn't eating with us, probably because of me. And I have to sleep in the attic, nearly a mile from your room. The atmosphere here is cold. Almost hostile. The wine is excellent though. My mother isn't feeling well. Okay, but why introduce me to her as your secretary? At least have some fruit. - Not again! - Why are you complaining? The dark helps the atmosphere. Your mother wishes to speak with you. She wants to see you in her room, immediately. Don't worry about me. Michael. Excuse me. I always knew you'd come back. I should have come long ago. That's not important, you're here now. The relationship between a mother and son is a mysterious one. No matter how far... no matter how long, I always felt that we had... never really left one another. I can't stay here long. I have to travel a lot for work, like a gypsy. Why not join me in London? We could be near each other. - We'd see one another often. - No. This is my home, Michael. I'm not well. Oliver told you the truth. I couldn't face a long trip. Now that I've returned I'll come to see you again. Help me up, please. No, the lights might go again. I want to show you something. I should've had this painting taken away. You have to forget, Michael, like I've forgotten. I waited for you until now. You shouldn't have come, I wanted to be alone. You're hurting me. - Hello. - Welcome. - Hi. - Hello. What about me? - Where's Michael? - I haven't seen him this morning. He's probably still sleeping. I forgot! I can leave my wife at home, especially on certain occasions, but never my camera. It's my third eye. Oliver, will you get their bags? - Michael told me you were coming. - I needed a rest after the film shoot, but he forced me to come here. - Authoritarian and tyrannical as usual. - It's always the way. Mother, these are my friends. - Hans Schwartz, the director. - My pleasure. - Shirley Dawson, assistant director. - Hello. Beryl Fisher, an actress in our film. - It's a miracle I'm still alive. - What do you mean? She's just joking. It's so cute. Beautiful. You're welcome. This way please. Thank you. - Make a toast with us. - I'm not drinking. Please. May I ask you a question, Oliver? It is your right to ask, sir. It is my duty to respond. Why didn't you want me to photograph you? Must I be sincere? I'd be grateful if you were. Because I'm superstitious. They say a photograph can steal someone's soul, make them very ill, or even kill them. Do you mean Voodoo rituals? On my island, Martinique, I took part in some rituals like that. But Shirley would know more about those things. Just because I was at a few s√©ances doesn't make me an expert in the occult. Besides, I haven't been at one in a long time. - What a strange bracelet. - It was a present from my father. He was an archeologist. It represents the famous plumed serpent, or something like that. I don't know what it represents, but it's definitely a magical symbol. The Mayan religion was mainly based on the plumed serpent. In any case it's just a legend. These things can't be proven, you either believe or you don't. For us they're the meaning of life. Conversations like these bore me. We have to rise early tomorrow. To go and see the grounds. I'll walk you to your room. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. - Shall we go up together? - Do you mind if I stay with Beryl? We've so much to talk about. Please excuse me, but I couldn't sleep. I don't think these books will help you nod off. It's been months, maybe even years, since I've been able to sleep well. Insomnia really is awful. Why are you interested in the occult? The only way to discover life's secret is through magic. - I don't understand. - Death. That exact moment when the body and soul separate, that which in theosophy is known as the astral body. We would have to capture that exact moment to analyze it, but to do this we would have to kill with our own hands, so that not even a wisp of life escapes us. - Don't you agree? - And would you kill someone for this? I think so. There definitely was something evil at play. How else could a shy, sensitive boy have found the strength and hate to kill his own father? When he was recovering in the clinic after the murder Professor Troyberg's told me that cases which are completely unpredictable are often the most dangerous. I remember well an analogy that he made. He described them as a quiet hill, covered in trees, gardens, and flowers. Suddenly, something terrible inside explodes. The quiet hill becomes a volcano, spreading death, desolation and destruction all around it. They become overwhelmed by a demonic force. - What are you thinking? - About what you just said. I'm sorry if I evoked all these memories for you. For the love of God, don't tell Michael we talked about this. He'd never forgive me, I'm sure of that. Don't worry yourself. Well, I'm going for a walk in the garden. Will I find you here when I come back? Do you believe in reincarnation? The only way to explain man's material and moral unhappiness is that he is paying for a beastly and degrading past life. Why do you ask? It was just a question. Goodnight, Mr. Schwartz. It was a pleasure to meet you. If it hadn't been for you and your film, Michael would never have returned. Thank you. Shirley. Shirley! Shirley! Where were you? I thought I heard a scream. I called for you but you didn't answer. I was hungry. I went to find something to eat. I don't know why you're so upset. Have a hot bath. It'll relax you, believe me. Believe me. Vigo, what are you doing? Beryl! Quick, help me! Quickly! Suddenly the room went dark. A hand grabbed me by the hair, and pushed me down. I fought back, but it was useless. He wanted to kill me, Shirley. I'm sure of it. You must have just fainted. I shouldn't have told you to take a bath. No! I told you someone wanted to kill me! Why? Who could have wanted me dead? Calm yourself! I'll leave the door of the room open, all right? Thank you. Goodnight. Someone didn't clean their shoes last night before entering. It was terrible, terrible! What the hell are you talking about? I was fast sleeping. Suddenly, I awoke with a start. I felt something beside me. It was a black shadow. In the dark I couldn't tell what it was. Then... I was still hanging on that cross. It was such a horrible dream. I thought the nightmare was never going to end. Well, I'm going to see the others. Oliver! Oliver, we won't be back for breakfast. This place is fantastic. - It's difficult to get here though. - Yes, it's very beautiful, but it's a shame the house is so far away. It appears that way, because the road is full of bends and holes, but on foot you can arrive here in a few minutes. Tell me, Hans, why were you wearing gloves in the bathroom last night? I was drying my hair. Using a hairdryer with wet hands can give you a shock. Pity that didn't happen. Here, this is the place I always dream of. Did you hear a scream last night? I didn't hear anything. You, Michael? Michael? It seems someone screamed last night. Pardon me, sometimes it's as though I fall into a trance. In those moments I don't know what's going on around me. My doctor says that it's psycho-traumatic dissociation. But I think he uses these words to justify his fee. - I asked if you heard a scream. - No. I didn't hear anything. I slept like a rock. It probably was... It might have been Oliver. Sometimes he has strange attacks. That would explain something else too. Last night I took a walk in the garden. The fog enshrouded the trees like a burial cloth. Suddenly, I saw Oliver coming towards me. He stared at me with his eyes wide open, but without seeing me he walked right by. - He pretended not to see you. - He was still angry about the photo. Or maybe he was drunk. Oliver is a tee-totaller, but he does sleepwalk. As a child I used to hide and watch him pass by like a ghost. Father wanted to fire him, but mother wouldn't let him. So he stayed with us. Was your father the famous pianist and orchestra conductor? Yes. And I killed him, if that's what you want to know. I don't even know how it happened. It seems I interrupted him while he was violently beating my mother. That night I had a very high fever. The doctor said it was meningitis, they all thought I would die. Instead I had a miraculous recovery, but I couldn't remember anything. Then I went to a sort of school, where bit by bit I returned to normal, and I became aware of what really happened. But you were just a boy. Why did you have to remind him? - I didn't know he'd react like that. - It's not hard to imagine. - What do I care about his past? - Don't get angry. Beryl! Beryl! I've been meaning to ask you: the other day on set, did you really want to strangle me? I could say that I was just in character, or something like that. But the truth is that I don't know. I couldn't control myself, as though a will more powerful than mine was forcing me to kill. The same will that... - that forced you to kill your father? - Perhaps. I SAW BERYL BEING MURDERED. I TRIED TO HELP HER IN VAIN. I'M GOING TO GET THE POLICE. HANS. - Do you recognize it? - Yes. - Hans' camera. - His famous third eye. Remember his little speech during the film shoot? "Without it I feel like I've been blinded, like Michael Strogoff." I've heard that so many times. He left without even saying goodbye, and forgot his most precious belonging, I just don't understand. Has Hans left? Yes, the great Hans! I saw his car leaving. Beryl probably left with him too. What are you going to do? I'll go back with Michael and you. Now I'm going to find somewhere to get these photos developed. I'm curious to see what he was photographing. You can develop them here. The maestro was passionate about photography. Michael said that there's a darkroom in the attic. A darkroom? Yes, I'll show you, then I'll wait for Michael downstairs. Pardon me, madam, I heard a gate close, I thought it might be Michael. Did you say a gate? It could be him. I'm sorry, I've got a dreadful migraine. See you at dinner. All right. Thank you. Won't we wait for Shirley and Michael? Michael might get back late, and I don't know where Shirley is. - Pardon me, madam. - Yes? I saw Master Michael return one hour ago. But then he left in a hurry. And as for the lady, I haven't seen her. But I don't understand, it's very strange. Perhaps it's not the right moment, but... I wanted to let you know that I can't find the chainsaw. Well... I must say that your friends' behavior is somewhat surprising. I'm not apologizing for them, but... No, don't make excuses for them. I know movie people. - But even Michael... - Yes, Michael. Unfortunately, my Michael is one of them too. But let's not talk about them anymore. You two are here, that's what's important to me. I never did believe that you were his secretary, Debora. Do you love him? Yes. And I'm sure he loves me too. He needs me. Even if sometimes he doesn't realize. I'm happy to hear you say that. It's so rare to find two young people who don't just think about sex. Love should never be a flame that leaves only ashes. It must be something deep, sublime. I'm going upstairs. Wait for Michael, if you wish. I wouldn't, if I were you. Michael! Michael! Michael! No one can save me now. What do you mean? You look distraught. I'm a maniac, a criminal. I keep killing people without even realizing it. What are you talking about? Beryl! How could I have done it? I brutally murdered her with a hunting knife. I entered a sort of trance and when I regained my senses there she was, covered in blood! You didn't kill anyone, not your father, nor Beryl. No one. It's not true. It can't be true. You couldn't have let me live in guilt for all these years. I'm sorry, Michael. But the truth is different, and it's even worse. I would have preferred to suffocate this secret forever. I never wanted to reveal it, but now you must know. Your father used to cheat on me. All the time, with anyone at all. I put up with everything, out of my love for you. Then finally... I understood why your father behaved the way he did. But by then it was already too late. Someone else was behind it. - Oliver. - Oliver? Your father was being controlled by him, he had become a person without any will of his own. - But why? - I don't know! Oliver... Maybe he hated his success. Or out of incontrollable jealousy. I've asked myself why so many times. Please, continue. He was in love with me. He wanted me to leave your father, by making me hate him. When William used to leave for one of his concerts I would close myself into his study and listen to music he conducted. One evening two hands touched my shoulders. I thought it was William, your father. Let me go! Let me go! Stop! No! I don't want to! Help! Help! Let me go! From that night I had to do what he wanted. But one night in this room... your father came in. The boy murdered him! That's what we'll say, the boy killed him. Your husband was beating you and he defended you. The boy killed him, that's what we'll say. Why didn't you say anything before now? I couldn't. I was scared, terrified. Oliver always threatened me. They said you were criminally irresponsible, and sent you far from me. Then you became a famous actor. Michael, you have to understand. What right did I have to destroy your life once again? It'll be different now, you won't be alone. - I'll stay with you. - No, you don't understand. Oliver won't let you. He killed Beryl. - You saw what he did! - I can't believe it. Hans photographed it so he killed him, and Shirley too because she found out! It's awful! You should have told me when I arrived. He'd have killed me, he'd have killed you too! The only person in the world that I love. We'll never have peace, Michael. Chase him away! Report him! Anything! Otherwise our lives will be a living hell! By opening the door you switched on the tape player. When you hear my voice... I will already be dead. Michael, the time has come for you to know the truth. Glenda is a monster. Your father was a wonderful man, but she hated him. One evening in her room... From that night onwards I was putty in her hands. Ready to obey her every order. She was beautiful, and I submitted myself readily. You see, Michael, I had always loved her. However, she had a criminal plan in mind. She made sure your father caught us. You heard the noise of the fight, and entered the room. Murderer! You killed him! I loved him and you killed him! Damn you! Damn you! Glenda said that you killed your father defending her. From that moment she became ever more dedicated to Satanism. And by making use of my paranormal abilities she made you come back here. But your friends came with you. She realized that you liked Beryl. Consumed by jealousy, she ordered me to kill her. The intervention of Shirley and Hans saved that poor girl. But Glenda found you in the woods and killed her. Just as she killed Hans and Shirley because of the photographs. Debora recognized the necklace. Glenda ordered me to follow her into the woods and kill her. But Debora was wearing a pentacle around her neck, the Seal of Solomon, the only defense against the demonic forces in the world. I realized the horrible nature of the crime I was about to commit. Look for Michael. Look for him! When you find him get as far from here as you can. Go! I tried to alert the police. I feel Death's cold hands on me. Get away from here, Michael. Get away. Michael! I hope you haven't believed his lies. I was certain he'd try to trick you. - Oliver had no reason to. - He knew I would have reported him. - He had no other choice. - Why do you keep lying? Why would I lie to you? You're all I have in life. I put up with everything because I knew one day you'd return. And now that you're here, it'll be just like it was. Your music will be played again in this house. It will dissipate all the pain and sadness of these years. You can play concerts again, William. And I'll always be with you, William. William? My father is dead. You killed him. I'm Michael, your son. No. No. Michael, the psychopathic child, is dead. You're William, you entered his body when he died, and I love you more than anything. I'll be everything you searched for in other women, and in that plain girl, Debora. Debora? What have you done to her? Have you killed her too? So it was true. It wasn't a dream. The black mass. The underground tunnels. No! Open up! Open up! Help! Help! Help!
