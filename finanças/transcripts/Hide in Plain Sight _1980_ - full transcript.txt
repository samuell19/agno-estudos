So, moriarity is there. He tells him, "very rarely," you know. I mean everybody's got knives that cut the rubber. Maybe somebody cuts the wrist, you know, cuts their arm, nothing you can call major, right? So, he's going by clemshack, right? He nods, how do you do? Clemshack puts his hand down, right?

I mean but, uh, you know last time I got a blind date, she looks like she's on fire put out with a fork. I gotta walk around like this all night so I don't embarrass her, you know. Hello. Last week, I chased blonde hair 3 blocks. And when I get there, what do you think I got? A guy with a mustache. A hippie bastard with a mustache. He says to me, hey. Hey, man. He says, you got a problem? Ha. He says I got a problem. I said, get a haircut, you pansy bastard. Have I got a problem? So tonight. What? What? I drive or what?

You--you don't tell nobody that. I mean I just say that to you. That's, uh-- what? Are you kidding? Anyway, eh, what? I see them once a week, so... It's a pleasure for me. Even if they're sleeping half the time. What are you gonna do? Man: Hey, rue. When's that doughnut man getting here? Woman: Tom said he'd be here at 8:00. Come here, hon. I want you to hook me up. I can't breathe. Don't go calling him names or anything in front of the kids. You promised. Yeah. Ok. Ok. It's just he gets on my nerves. You know? Daddy! Hi there, big guy. Girl: Daddy! Hey.

Sit with your daddy. Heh heh. That's a girl. Look at that. Look at the dolphin. He's--he's helping the poor doggie. Flipper's gonna save him. You don't tell your mom I let you stay up this late, all right? Ok. I got a surprise for you. I mean that's if mom tells me you've been a good boy. What, dad? Shh. Don't wake up your sister. Um, let's see. Saturday after next, I got, uh, 2 box seats to, uh, the ballgame in Rochester. What do you say to that? Ok. Can junie go, too? No, no. She's--she's too little.

Go on. Ok, hon. Excuse me. Hey, carmine. Wanna ask you something. Go ahead. They're giving this party tonight for this guy over here, Tony because, uh, he did his time on the contempt rap? Not for the time. For the rap. You get it, slick? Yeah, yeah. Why you gotta call me slick like that, huh? 'Cause I don't like you, all right? Hey, you don't gotta like me. Bobby momisa invited me here personally. Personal? Yeah. You know one of these days, somebody got a reason, and I'm gonna peel your goddamn head like a grape. Bobby's got 50 bums like you. Bums. Bums like me? Do yourself a favor, pal. Read the papers. Heh heh heh. [Singing in Italian] Jack: You know what worries me? The driver. I hear he's a fed. Now, what do you know about that? Man: It didn't occur to me to ask after his sex life. What about the bags? Red, blue... Will you not worry about the bags? I got them covered. I hope for our sake Mary Alice makes it to the back door. Ready? Mm-hmm. Let's go. Jack: Excuse me, folks. Pardon me, please. Hey, get at the end of the line! What are you crazy?

Women out here to the front of the line! [Alarm ringing] Guard: Hey! Hold it! Would you get back there for Christ's sake?! Hey! Over here! The cops said I had to move the goddamn car! Made me lose my hat, god damn it! School teacher? You know. I don't know. What are you talking? You gotta be smart to teach first grade. Hey, now listen. Don't forget. Look her straight in the eye when you talk. What? Women like directness. You ever see Clark gable look down in one of his films? * and here's looking at you * this is Matty, my boyfriend, and this is Thomas-- hack, the guy you've been hearing about recently. Extremely nice to meet you, Alicia. Nice to meet you, too. * aren't we formal * handshake, no kiss... Uh, so I've heard you're from California, right? Alisa: Yes. You're what, uh... Palm trees and sunshine out there. We got winter in buffalo. Yes, the weather is different. What do you do? Teaches school, Tom. I thought I told you that. Elementary school right now. I'm working towards full certification. Ohh, yeah. I really, uh, respect that, Alicia. It's pronounced "alisa." Oh, hey. I'm sorry. That's interesting. Alisa. Uh, I heard a shh, you know. Alicia. There's no shh. My friends call me Ali. Matty calls you hack. Yeah. Matty: Thomas hacklin, Jr. Uh, I call him hack. His mother calls him Tommy, and some of the old guys down at the plant, they call him junior 'cause they remember his dad. Hey, sweetheart! Uh, this a desert or a bar or what? I'm sorry. I didn't see you. We'd like, uh... White wine. Wine. Thanks, dear. And a whiskey sour, 2 cuttys neat with water backs. Waitress: Ok. All right. Thank you. Thank you. A little spring fling tonight. Uh, this spring fling, you know, that--that Matty was talking about. Excuse me? Tom: You see, our local-- they put on this dance every year. It's very nice, with-- good way to get to know people, you know? If you're new in town? Really, Ali. Yeah. If you've got plans, I understand. Matty: Well, what plans? They got a great band, atmosphere, and, actually, Alicia, you'd be doing US a favor. It's alisa. Alisa. You know, 3's odd, 4's even. You know? Round out the group. But, I don't think we should-- oh, we don't want to pressure you or nothing. You haven't got anything else to do, have you? Woman: No. No, she'll come. It's fun, Ali. Excuse me a minute, please. Hey, hack. What's wrong? Excuse me. Man: Yes, sir? Um, was that scolese? Jack scolese? Yeah, why? You know him? Yeah. They want him for that city treasury thing. Thanks. Man, on TV: ...Hit and run battles filled area hospitals' emergency rooms. No one is certain what sparked the rampage of destruction... Um. I know this is very rude and I apologize. I gotta go. It's got nothing to do with you. Hey, hey. Man, on TV: ...Meets in 2 days. He will try to fly to Los Angeles for a speech at a Democratic fund raiser... Yeah. Well, we heard it on the news, too. He left. That's good. Where's Andy and June? I got them playing over at a friend's house. What friend? What for? What for? I take 'em to my mother's, that's what for. Hey, try and keep your voice down. He's not coming back. Well, that's good. Punk. Oh, come on, Tom. That's a real nice hero for my kids. You know? Really nice. You got a nice boyfriend there. Ah, mind your own business! Ah, shut up! Bye, Mrs. Novack. Bye, Tom. [Train whistle blowing] Hey, destiny-maker. You gotta wear a scarf on that hair. You're going to look funny in a snow storm, for Christ's sake. [Panting] I was careful. Come on. Get in here. Come on! Come on. Lay off me. Jack: I'm sorry, honey, but 5 days I've been locked up here, you know? It's beginning to smell like an old closet in here. Somebody's going to pick you up tomorrow morning. [Sighs] Well, it's about time. Did he say what happened to frantuzzi and the kid? They're out there somewhere. You're the only one that's identified. Sure, why not? I'm the only one with guts. Hey, don't worry about that. Bobby admires that. He's going to take good care of me. Jack: Jeez, no respect. Turn myself in? Bobby: Carmine, turn off the music. Nobody asked you to do this. You did this stupid thing on your own. Bobby, I thought it was a good job, you know? Please. Don't think. All right? Please. What doesn't help is, the little guy you popped on the head with the gun. Ahh! I just tapped the guy, you know? Yeah. That's assault. It doesn't matter how hard you hit him. Hey. Wait a minute, here. Hey, where's he going, huh? I gotta take a leak. Huh, ok? Is that all right? I read the papers, slick. [Slams car door] See, you cooperate, we do our share. We pay the lawyer, everything. Ok. Bob, you don't know how good that makes me feel. Yeah, that's fine, Jackie. That's fine. This, uh, Ruth. What about her? Any plans? Aw, no. I mean, you know, we get along fine, but no big plans or nothing like that. I think you should marry her. Marry her? I don't want to get married. She's good-looking and all that, but I don't want to marry her, you know? If it was me, that's what I'd do. She's the person Pete and I have been talking to. And, as your wife, she wouldn't be able to testify. Plus, it looks good. You being a family man. So, tomorrow you drive to erie, take care of everything in one day, all right, Jackie? [Car door opens] [Car door shuts] Hey, Jackie. Shut the door. It's cold. [Sighs] [Birds cooing] [Classical music playing] She gave you a break, going to the fling. But you gotta look sharp. Hey. Where you going? Huh? I gotta pick up the kids, you know? They're with ruthie. She's gotta do something or other. You want to walk with me or what? Yeah. Come on. She calls me last night, you know? Says al Capone turned himself in. She wanted to talk to me real bad. Oh, maybe she wants you back. Yeah. That's the same thought I had, you know? Hey, what's the purpose of the cuff, anyway? That's in case you grow. Huh? In case you grow. It makes sense, don't it? [Car horn honking] Ahh! Hey, lady! You give me a kiss! Mwah! Mwah! Hi. Hiya, Matty. Hi. Hey, you look--i mean, you know, you look terrific. I mean, what? Is that a new dress? Blue. Blue's a good color, you know? Yeah. Thank you. Um. Kisses, kisses! Hey, Tom, look, can you and I just talk alone for a minute? Oh, yeah. Matt, you want to take the kids? I'll see you in a minute. Yeah. Come here. I'm gonna play... Good boy. Um. Look, the reason I wanted to talk to you, I wanted to tell you that-- yesterday, Jackie and i--we got married. Married? Yeah. You got married? Yeah. Who's going to bring up those kids, huh? I thought you would be really happy. I would? You know why? Because I... [Both arguing] Come on. Let's get out of here. I'm starving. I'm sick of looking at this punk. Hey, then. Don't bother me no more, huh? [Knocking] Let me out. [Door closes] Now, why did you do that in there? Do what? Get on him like that. Do you have any idea how important this project is? This is the first time out. It's got to work. This isn't Washington. I know these people. He's scared. I can read it in his eyes. He has to believe US. Or when we say, ok, Jackie, you talk. You tell US what you know. We'll go right down the line for you, huh? He'll know it isn't some bullshit con artist cop trying to kiss his ass. I know these people. There was a reason they told me to get you. I sure hope they were right. What makes you so sure momisa and thiaco won't help ruthie and the children? Because I've got 2 plainclothes watching the house. Nobody goes in. Nobody calls, either. 'Cause it's been leaked out the phone's tapped. Ruthie's going to tell Jackie that marzetta the cop has been buying the groceries. Let him go up for sentencing. You'd be amazed what the thought of 5 to 10 can have on somebody. Huh? Huh? Come on. * shadow of your smile * when you are gone * will color all my dreams * and light the dawn * look into my eyes, my love * * and see * all the lovely things * you are to me... No. Oh! Excuse me. When you handed me them, I thought you were giving them to me. I apologize. Must have been daydreaming. That's ok. It's really stupid. * ...Now when I remember spring * * all the joy that love can bring... * pretty nice song. Want to dance? Ok. You want to smoke? No, no, no. That's all right. I'll try not to hurt you too bad. Hey, my favorite shortstop. How you doing? This is Ali. Irene, right? You could play anywhere. We're gonna dance, all right? [Music continues] [Crowd applauds] [Band playing] Man: Dance. Come on, dance. [Woman screams] Man: Somebody give me a hand. Hey. Hey! Let go of me. [People yelling] Happens every year, you know? There's always a beef. Didn't scare you or nothing? No. It's all right. You won't believe this, you know, but them 2 guys there are good buddies. It will clear up in a minute and we can go back inside. If it's all the same to you, I'd rather not. Yeah. Well, it won't happen again. Oh, it's not that. [Slow music playing] Yeah, well. I don't like it much myself. Ali: You still in love with your ex-wife? I used to love her, I think. That bothers you, that she remarried? No, it's not that. My kids. This new guy bringing them up. Even being around them. That's just something that really bothers me. I just wish more parents were concerned for their children. You know? Oh, yeah. I mean, I really love them, you know? Hey, come here. Here. That's--that's Andy. He's good looking. Takes after his mother. He's a--he's a hell of a kid. Very serious. Nuts about baseball. For a kid his age, he's got a hell of an arm. And here-- the little one, here. She, uh--you talk about a temper. That's it right there. I mean, she's only 3 years old, and, already she lets you know who's boss, you know? I don't know why I did that. I mean, uh, the pictures. I feel like one of them dumb fathers. I get carried away. That's nothing to be embarrassed about. Yeah. You sure you're not cold? No. I'm fine. Tell you what. Take my jacket, all right? [Man and woman talking softly] [Police sirens] Can I ask you a question? Yeah. Sure. Anything. What? When we first met in the restaurant? Yeah. You had the strangest look in your eyes. You noticed that? Yes. [Laughs] What's the matter? Well, uh, Matty-- you know Matty? Mm-hmm. He's got this thing, you know? About how women-- how they respect directness. He says, "when you meet Ali, you look her right in the eye." Clark gable-- you never see Clark gable in any of his movies looking down at the ground. So, uh, how do you do? I'd like you to meet Clark gable, here. Can I buy you a cup of coffee? I'd love it. Nice bunch of guys you've been working for. I bet they said they was going to help you and your family, huh? What'd they do? Bring you a couple of meatball sandwiches? [Snickers] 5 years at attica, a good-looking kid like you. Some punk's gonna stick a knife against your throat and you're going to drop your pants. Who knows? Might change your personality. Yeah, I heard that routine you gots at the newsstand. We can say to you that if you will open up with US, give US everything that you have concerning the venucci family, and if the details of your testimony can be corroborated-- what's all this "if" shit? Hey, do me a favor, huh? Don't do me no favors. That's enough. Now, that's enough. Jackie, what do you think we're doing here? Telling cute stories? I don't need no favors, Sam. The hell you don't! Now, if we can get enough hard evidence-- say I'll become a fink. What's in it for me? What do I get out of it? We put you in the witness relocation program. The witness what? What the hell's that? After we clear you with the state, we take you and your family. We give you new identities. We move you to another city and get you a job. And no one will ever be able to find you. A job. What kind of a job? You won't get rich. But your family's taken care of. You get to make love to your wife, huh? Jackie... See, the witness relocation program has been designed specifically to protect people in your situation. Yeah. I want to go back to my cell, eh? Are we really going to the zoo? You betcha, big guy. Junie: Hooray! The zoo! Hey! Hey! You hurry to the car. Ah, you like 'em skinny now, eh? How you doing? She good, Tom? Why you talk like that? Um, ruthie, this is Ali. Nice to meet you. Hi, Mrs. Novack. Hi, Tom. Have a good time. Junie: Yeah! Yeah! [Car engine starts] [Children laughing] Why are they always rubbing? Rubbing? 'Cause they're itching, probably. You know, like when you wear a sweater, you always itch? You know, a woolen sweater? Very clever. Tom: Yeah. Let's go. Ali: Ok. [Birds cawing] Go, go, go! I'm gonna nail you! I'm gonna nail you! Gotcha! Tom: She said I was good looking? Mm-hmm. Well, I'll have to thank Madeline for that. [Laughs] Anyway, I, uh-- I know my mouth was moving, but, uh, not sure what I was saying. But I know what I was thinking. I was thinking, um... Oh, god, I like this girl. I like her very much. This girl, right now, you know what she's thinking? I said, Pete and Bobby, they don't call. I got bills at home I can't pay. Oh, those dumb bastards. All they had to do is help out a little. Nothing! They're selling me out, rue. They're not standing by me like they should. Marzetta, a damn cop, for Christ's sake, brings groceries by and whatever. Yeah. Sam, he comes by every day. Sammy says that-- Sammy says? I know what Sammy says. All right. Look. Go home. Don't talk to nobody. Screw those bastards. I'm gonna take care of them on my own. Go on now. Go on. Yeah. Man: And now, Mr. Scolese, would you identify the defendant, Robert momisa, for the court, please? Jack: Yeah. Bobby momisa. I mean Robert. [Clears throat] Robert momisa. That gentleman right there. The grey suit and the red tie, sitting at the right-hand table. That is your right? Right. Thank you. Would you now identify the defendant Peter m. Thiaco for the court, please? Man: Everybody back away. Everybody back! We need to take a side door, hey, Sam? Don't worry, Jackie. Nobody's going to hurt you. Come on. [People yelling] Man: Move it. Move it. Move it! What? I gotta say it twice? [Crowd cheering] Man: Let's go! Come on! 2 away! 2 away! Second man: Let's get a hit, guys! Let's get a hit, huh? Get on 'em now. Hey, Tom. Where you going? You're up this inning. No, no. I told you only a couple of innings. I gotta pick up my kids, all right? We'll see you later. Hey. Hey, Dee Dee! Can you believe this guy? When the kids-- their eyes are going to pop out of their heads when they see him. Wait here, honey. All right? [Doorbell rings] [Glass breaks] Tom? [Dog barking] [Buzzing] Mrs. Novack! Hey, Mrs. Novack! Mrs. Novack! Mrs. Novack, please. Do you know what happened to ruthie and the kids? I didn't see a thing. I'm asking you, please. Well, I think they left last night around midnight. The noise woke me up. 2 big cars. Tom, what's wrong? Um... They're gone. Everything's gone. Take it easy, Mr. Hackman. It's hacklin. Hacklin. Hacklin. Now help me fill out this report. Your wife's name? Ruth, uh, scolese. A lamp, you know? She took a lamp. I mean, you don't take that on a trip. All right, Mr. Hackman. Um, you understand this could take time-- yeah, I understand. So can you--can we start on this right away? Let's fill out the form. We'll go on from there. Cross in the green, not in between. Yeah, yeah. Hi. Hey. How'd it go? Well. He don't call. It's 5 days. What? He's always too busy. I just think you have to talk to someone else. Yeah. Why is it, though? I mean, I'm a taxpayer. I pay this detective raskin's salary and he can't even pick up the phone. Tom, we talked about it. This--this Sam marzetta? This strike force or whatever? They're the ones that are involved in the scolese case. Yeah. Well. Look, maybe i--maybe I ought to run over there now, huh? Ok. You make it home all right or what? I'll make it. You look tired. Well, I didn't sleep too good last night. Excuse me. I'm supposed to meet Sam marzetta down here. Could you point him out to me? The hat. Excuse me. Mr. Marzetta? Yeah? I'm Thomas hacklin. They told me down at your office that I could find you here. They say you're in charge of this new-- right. Right. Fine. Sure. You see I'm eating my lunch, huh? It's bad enough i'm eating 2, 3 hours late. Maybe you could wait a couple of minutes, huh? Ok? Yeah, right. I've been really getting a terrible run-around from this guy down at missing persons. I keep calling the guy, and he just-- right, right. Look. Maybe I could finish my sandwich, huh? I appreciate that you guys work hard. I just--just need a couple minutes of your time, and I'll walk you back to your office. Look, why don't I get a cup of coffee, and you go ahead. I apologize. I'll be right back. See you, Rose. Bye, Sam. What kind of police department we got here? Look, I want to talk to somebody. Bet you if I was crossing the street here there'd be 5 cops here to give me a goddamn jaywalking ticket. It's not my job. I'm sorry. What can I tell you? I got nothing to say to you. Hey, look. Look, I got 2 kids missing, and nobody wants to talk to me. Hey, what kind of bullshit is this? What have I got to do? Shoot somebody? Hey! Stop! Hey, stupid! Sorry. Hey, make some room! Oh, here. Here. See, it says that Reid is from the justice department. Now he's the top man in this special task force. Gonna wipe out the mafia. Sounds like the goddamn green berets. So, Reid is marzetta's boss. I guess now I gotta go see this guy Reid. I'm gonna go after work. Man: Hey, you got 15 cents for the candy machine? Look at that. Oughta have separate lunch rooms for these bambury operators. Uh, I'm afraid he isn't in now. Miss, you--you asked me to sit down. Uh... You could've told me he's not here right away. Look, he's not here, mister. You understand? Yeah, but, uh, you told me to sit down and everything. What would you like me to do? Would you like me to make him appear? I'm not a magician. He's not here. It's that simple. Could I leave him my name and number? Of course. Please leave it. Is this all right here? That's fine. I really feel for this guy hacklin. I mean... He was pathetic when he came to see me. Pathetic I tell you. He just doesn't understand. Has it occurred to you there may be somebody behind him? What? Using him to run down Jackie. What are you talking about Jackie? Want some more wine? Reestablish your priorities. Jackie's our biggest problem. What are you talking about? I talked to him last night. 2:00 in the morning. He was having trouble with this new foreman. Wouldn't get off his back. I'll tell you, somebody better talk to that guy. He's gonna cause trouble. Sometimes I worry we picked the wrong guy to start this whole program with. Oh, that's beautiful. That's really beautiful. 12 guys you lock up all because he sings. What'd you expect, an angel? Joey, you're beautiful. Wonderful. The best. You want some more clams? No. Have some more clams. Hey, I thought you were supposed to get to eat. Listen, Tom, you know Mr. Hyde? The vice-principal, the one who's been helping me get my program to the board? Yeah, I think so. We were talking, and he said that he knows a lawyer. Lawyer? Oh, no. No lawyers. I can hardly say hello to them. He said this man is very aggressive and dedicated. Miss? $2.50, you had a five. Thank you. Thanks. And he said he thought this man was somebody you should talk to. I don't know. You can't go on without any help. And he really wants to see you. There's no charge for the talk. You talk to him already? Yeah. The meeting's set for 4:30 Thursday. Did it all by yourself, huh? Mm-hmm. Hey, you, cacci! God damn it, I'm talking to you! P.A.: Bob brinker, Bob brinker, report to loading dock 3. This cheeseburger's terrible. What do you expect for 60 cents, huh? Want something better, get off your butt and find yourself a job. Hey, I wanna. Every time I talk to you about getting a job, what do you do? You say no. Then you blow up at me. I can't take the skin off, honey. What are you saying? What'd I say? I just said every time I talk to you, when I tell you I want to go get a job, you get mad. That's right. And I'll say it again, I don't want you working. Jackie, can I have more French fries? Here, slugger, have some of mine. You want this, baby? You want to be a big boy when you grow up? Eat a lot of fries, you know? Wring 'em out first. Hey. How'd you find me? Matty told me. Said you've been coming here for a hundred years. Oh, yeah. I can see why. It's nice. Come on, sit down. Now, that's Canada right there. You know that? Right there, that's wilderness park. Do you go there a lot? No, never--never been there. Just look at it. Did you catch anything? Uh, no. Not in the last 10 years, anyway. I guess the water's dirty. We used to, though. I went to a doctor today. What's the matter? Nothing. I mean, my health's fine. Oh, thank god for that. I'm pregnant. I'm sorry. Sorry? We'll just, uh, we'll get married. Saturday or Sunday. There's no problem here. You don't have to marry me. What do you mean I don't have to? I mean I don't think that's a good way to start. Wait a minute. I love you. I love you very, very much. I love you. I love you. Very, very much. But you don't have to marry me. You don't have to. I was gonna ask you anyway. I was. I was gonna ask you anyway. And, uh, I mean, the kid's gotta-- you love me, don't you? Hey, why don't I buy you a cup of coffee? Ok. All right. Come on. Ok. I'm really happy about it. Honest, I am. My mother's gonna be thrilled. Man: So, all that's happened all these months is that you've been running around in circles. No legal steps whatsoever. You haven't even established your right to custody. Is that correct? Ali: That's correct. What is your relationship? She's my fiancee. Oh, and I love her very much. Right. When you go up against the government, Mr. Hacklin, things can get tough. I'm not talking about weeks. It could drag on for months, years, it'll involve research. Very heavy legal expense. We could pay some each week. We could send-- all right. You've explained your financial status. If I take the case, I'm not gonna see you go broke. You say if? Well, I said I'd be up front with you. I'll call you in a day or so. Ok? Ok. Thank you very much. Thank you. Evelyn? Evelyn? Evelyn! Yes, sir? Call the evening news. See if Lee mchugh is around. Lawyer: Played extremely well out there today. Mchugh: Bullshit. What do you want from me? I want you to write about this guy. Human interest thing, is that what you're saying? Last week, your paper runs a full page on a blind vegetarian that ran the Boston marathon, for Christ's sake. What I'm talking about is a man whose children were stolen. Human interest, my ass. Ok, ok. Thank you, Henry. This guy's a poor working stiff. Does his hitch as a marine, comes back to sweat out an honest buck. Always minds his own business. He doesn't protest. He doesn't riot. Look at that asshole. You think somebody's gonna take his kids? No apologies, no words, no nothing? Maybe he wants a soapbox. Bullshit. I'm gonna take it. I'm gonna take 'em on. The whole goddamn government. The whole goddamn government? Yeah, that's right. No, no. You miss the point. This is a lay-off. Couple, 3 months, maybe. Just while we convert to the new machines. We gotta bring in the radials. You just missed the seniority cut-offs. You talk about seniority here. What? My old man, he has, uh, 36 years he put in here. I got 8. That's, what, 44. I'd keep you on over any guy in the joint, you know that. Those are the rules, Tommy. I swear I feel as bad as you do about this. Oh, no, you don't. Rules, my ass. Thanks a lot. No, I mean, really. I appreciate the way you call me in here and tell me personally. Tommy... Worthless bastard. Gave him a new name. Even find him a new job. One in the corner. Hey, Rick, what happened? Pole just scored. They ought to handicap him. Put weights on him like a racehorse. Back to 5, side. You shoot good when you're mad. You gonna call the 8? Where the hell does it look like it's going? Corner. I know you're tense, but maybe the kids are someplace nice, you know. Someplace where it's warm and sunny now. Here. Here. Here. That's all right. You got a lot-- here, take it. I don't want to hear any of your shit, all right? Take it. See, the key thing is that you now have custody, and we have every right-- custody, sal? I got custody of what? I got custody of this here, look. Here's what I got custody of, this piece of paper. You know? So, uh... You know, that's--that's what I got custody of. Hey, Tom, where you going? I'm taking my kids to lunch. Did you read that? Yeah. That's 2 stories this week. That boy's writing a book. Willoughby says keep a low profile, avoid controversy, and that shit ends up on l.B.J.'S desk. I mean, they're digging a hole for me. I'm not a p.R. Man. Well, you know some of those people down there at that newspaper. So? Why don't you have a little talk with one of his editors? [Intercom buzzes] Yeah? Woman: Mr. Reid, Mr. Robey's on line 4. It's important. Yeah? Who? Oh. Yeah. Yeah, I remember him. Do I have a choice? Ok. Right. Fine. What? Going back to court. Who? Hacklin. Sal: The lower court decision fails to hold the government accountable for its intrusion into a domestic situation. It upholds the legitimacy of arbitrarily, without inquiry, removing these children from their natural father and blocking any attempt to learn of their whereabouts by creating new identities. Judge: Mr. Fieldston. Fieldston: May it please the court, Mr. Carvello surprises me. The kind of emotional appeal we just heard is usually reserved for a jury, not this learned court. The children were living with their natural mother pursuant to a valid divorce decree that gave her custody. Naturally, they all live with her new husband Mr. Scolese. Is it unlawful? Is it even unfair? To protect a man who freely testified for the public good, and by so doing, placed his life in jeopardy? The lower court found that it was not. What about the danger to my kids? I mean, did anybody think of that? Sit down, Tom. I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you to remove your client, Mr. Carvello. I'm no goddamn hippie who dances around the flag, you know. Please, sir, remove your client, Mr. Carvello. I always respected the government. Always, you know. Just relax a couple of minutes, Tom. Mom, why don't you go on ahead? Ok? Call me. I'm sorry. I knew it anyway. I mean that. You all right? I feel sick to my stomach. Take alka-seltzer. When you celebrate, think about what you really won. Look, save the theatrics for court, all right? Richard, you did a fine job. We'll see you guys again. I promise you that. Look forward to it. Piece of cake. I tell you... We keep going. To the supreme court if we have to, all right? Thanks again, Richard. Cocky little son of a bitch. Mr. Hacklin, Lee sent US down here. I got nothing to say. Excuse US a few seconds, will you, fellas? Come on. Tom, I'm your friend, right? I mean, you understand that? Yeah. Well, I want you to talk to these guys. We need the press now more than ever. Tom. Look, i--i said something in the courtroom, and everybody laughed. No, no. Nobody's laughing. I don't want to talk right now. Nobody's laughing, trust me. Yeah? Man: Mr. Hacklin, give US a comment. If they was your kids, how do you suppose you'd feel? I mean, some hood robs a bank, and, uh-- [car engine starts] [Honks horn] Hey, Mr. Hacklin? What? What's the next step? Um... I don't know. But did you actually seek employment? That's what I'm asking you. Well, I drove my truck by, and I sees that he's already gots his signs up. I didn't see any point in stopping to ask. Ok. Take this to line e. Next. You're in the wrong line. What do you mean the wrong line? It says up top here "n.C." Aah. It's 3:00. I've been here since noon. [Sighs] Look, I don't have nothing to do with that. This is "c" only, and you're a new processee. Forget the new processee, uh, just be a little reasonable here. Next. I've been on this line for 3 hours. I can't help you. Did you work last week? Uh, no, ma'am, I did not. Did you look for work? Yes, I did. [Tires squealing] God, mister, I'm sorry. Hey, wait. Wait. Let me tell you something, champ. You and your little honey here want to grab some ass, you take it someplace else. This is a decent neighborhood. Get out of here. [Dog barking] What are you doing? Other people are allowed out in the street. You're acting like a maniac. Don't ever call me names. Yes? This is his mother. Collect from where? Who shall I say is calling? Wait a minute, operator. Tommy. It's a collect call from Michigan. What? I can't hear you, operator! Oh. Oh, all right. I see. Never mind. She hung up. Tom: Who was it, mom? Oh, some lady. A Ruth cacci. Who is that? Tom: Ruth? Ruth ca-- what the hell is wrong with you, mom? That was Ruth! Ruth? Ruth! I mean who the hell's gonna call you long distance, anyway?! Why didn't you accept the charges right away?! Tom, please. She didn't know. Where was it from? Michigan. Where in Michigan? Tommy, I'm sorry. Don't yell at me. Where in Michigan, mom? Ann arbor. Ann arbor. Tom, please call sal. What? Call sal! I don't need sal. I'm gonna get 'em. Tom! 4.70, please. All right. Keep it. Thank you. Man: Ok. Ok. That's enough. Radio: U.S. Military command in Saigon says that soaring casualties are expected in each phase of the fighting. The border between north and south Vietnam is really shifting... [Tires squealing] [Truck honks] [Tires squealing] What's your problem? Car trouble? Tom: What are you doing? What? Um, have you been following me? Just driving down the road is all. Uh, where you going? What is this? Your private driveway. I got on the throughway. I paid my toll. What do you want? You were following me for the last hundred miles. I'm one of those guys that gets lost. Why don't you, uh, like me following you? Do I stink or something? No, uh... I just, uh... Well, uh... Thanks, you know. I just-- I'm just-- I just gotta go. Hey, hey. Hacklin. How do you know my name? You're f.B.I., a cop, or what? Wrong side. We all want the same thing. He screwed US over with his mouth. He's got your kids. Come on. Let's be partners. Um... I don't--i don't, uh, know anything about that. Kids are not in, uh... I gotta go. Nice talking to you. Come on, hacklin. Look, I'm not leading you anywhere. [Engine starts] Hey, Sam. I don't want to move again. What am I? Bekins? So the hard hat was coming here, so what? Let the jerk come. What do you mean, my friends were followed? How you doing? It's a rough thing to happen, huh? Tom: Yeah. Yeah. We didn't, uh... We didn't expect it to happen this way. Want to go someplace? Coffee or something? No. You know, uh, I know it doesn't do any good, but, uh, I'm sorry about the way the whole thing turned out. I'm gonna try to do something to help out, you know. Just give US, uh, give US a little while, huh? How long? Year. Year. In the meantime, maybe you could...Write. Write some letters. Excuse me. I'll see that they're forwarded. Look. We're just trying to clean this whole city up for all the kids' sake. Try to understand. You got any kids, marzetta? No. Look at this part here. "I would appreciate it... "I would appreciate it hey, look at this. I'm married to her 7 years. She spells hacklin "lyn." Common mistake. You gotta start calling him something else besides "hey, dog." It's not fair to the animal. Eh, well, I got him for the kids. The kids will name him. You're gonna have a confused dog on your hands. Hey, beautiful! Hey, honey. Be careful now, will you? Watch them boards. Hey, sit down. I'll get you a beer. Ali: Tom, where have you been? I've been here. Sal's been trying to reach you for 3 hours. How come's that? You're flying to Washington tomorrow. To Washington? You have an appointment with congressman evetts. Yeah? You're flying early tomorrow morning. How about that? That sounds something, huh? He seems really excited about it. Hey, hack! You know how many guys we grew up with talk with a congressman? Close your eyes. What do you see? Nothing. That's how many. None. Tom: Hold it. I told Ali I'd pick her something up for the apartment, you know. Sal: We can get something later, Tom. All right. We'll be back, huh. You know. I liked that j.F.K. That's a guy I really thought was a good president, you know. Now, remember when that little, uh, that little bastard, that khrushchev, you know, he tried to sneak them what, the missiles into Cuba? He said, hold it right there, you guys. We draw the line right here. That was the end of that. Right? Evetts: Yes, Charlotte. Right. He's out there now? Uh? Could you, uh, tell him I'll be with him in just a minute? Fine. Thank you. Whoo. I am sorry. Now, go on, please. We need your help. See, at the cost of approximately $100,000, the justice department has removed Mr. Hacklin's natural children in order to protect a convicted felon. I don't care what program that's under, that's wrong. Yes, yes. Yes, yes. They do get carried away sometimes. They, uh, they work best, you know, on a short leash. Ha ha. Well, gentlemen, I'm glad you came by and, uh, I promise you I'll do everything I possibly can. Nice to have met both of you. Thank you, sir. Bye. Ahem. I'm going to have to file a petition for a writ of certiorari, try and get US on the docket as soon as I can. Writ of--what, what's that? Certiorari. That's when you ask a higher court to review a case. How long does that take? I hope no more than 6 months. We want to make this session. Forget the district court. We appeal to the court of appeals, the mandamus, the declaratory judgment, the injunction. All that. This is the supreme court. Oh, I didn't hear you come in. Did you knock? Excuse me. The door was open. You're mister, uh... Hacklin. Tom hacklin. Well, I'm sorry, Mr. Hacklin, but Mr. Marzetta and Mr. Reid aren't in. If you care to leave your name and address, or perhaps you'd care to wait. Then I can help you. What are you doing? I want that address, the one that, uh, you send my letters to. What address? Scolese, cacci, whatever his goddamn name is now. I want--i want that address. Oh, I'm sorry. I will have to call Mr. Reid about that. You don't have to call anybody. I want the address. What are you doing?! Put that down! [Crash] Oh, my god! You're doing it again. You won't listen to anybody. Do you realize what they could do to you? Yeah, well-- I'm through talking, all right. What about our lives? This is our baby. I don't want you to go away now. I want you to stay with me. God damn it! I want normal lives for US! It can't be normal without the kids I already got. I want those kids as much as you do, but sal called. He said he thought the congressman would help. He said, "someday, Ali, "the president of the United States will apologize to Tom." Now you're starting to sound like everybody else. Do this, and don't do that. This is right. That's wrong. Stop. Go. I feel like a goddamn traffic light! Just leave me alone! They put the list up again today. You're going back to work. You told me that 5 times already. You want a ride to the airport? No. Do me a favor, will you? Stay with her. You stay. I'll have your table ready in just a moment. Sit down and have a drink on me, hmm? Don't mind if I do. Do you mind? Dixon, replace his drink for her, will you? Cheryl, honey. Clean up table 4 for me, will you? Thank you. There's a cowboy-soundin' son of a bitch. Yeah. [Door opens] Sal: You're real late, big John. Sam: How long ago? How long ago? We haven't got time for this. Mrs. Hacklin, this is serious. Your husband could get hurt. Call Albuquerque and get an agent on this right away. [Dialing telephone] You don't mind if we use the phone, Mrs. Hacklin? Yes. Yes. I said yes. I-I do mind. [Hangs up phone] Reid: Come on. [Door shuts] Turn around and keep it running. I'm not going anywhere. [Blender whirs] Uh, bartender? Excuse me. Bartender: Be with you in a second, sir. Yeah, will you bring... Bartender: Yes, sir? Is, uh, Jackie scolese about? Who? Jackie. He works the door. He wears, like, a cowboy suit. Oh! Jackie shendle, yeah. Yeah. That's shendle. That's right. Is he around? Well, he was here a second ago. Where the hell did he go? You a member here, sir? No. Just a friend. He invited me in for a drink. [Dog barks] [Dog barks] [Dogs barking] [Click] [Whack] Hey! Hey! Hold it! Hold it! Jackie: Who's out there? It's me. Hacklin. Hacklin! You alone? Yeah. [Dogs barking] What the hell are you doing here? Man: Oliver! Come here. Where are the kids? They're not here. Where are they? Hey, look. Just go on back to buffalo. I'll have them write you or call you or something. What's wrong with you? Easy. Easy. Where are they? Where are my kids? At the sand dunes motel. Where is that at? Just 3 blocks down the main road. Look. I took care of them. I did all I could. You're not lying to me? I swear to god. I swear on my mother. [Dog barks] Come on. Don't let the kids see you crying, all right? Huh? Look, you can see them whenever you want. You got my word on that. I do understand. Mr. Hacklin? We just cleaned up that mess you made. You're a very lucky man. Hey, get away from there. Get away! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Department of justice. Nobody... Nobody... Airport. Andy: What's the matter, dad? Nothing, son. We're going home. Come on, he's not our business. P.A.: This is the final boarding call for flight 231 for Chicago and Toronto. Now boarding at gate 17. Tom: How do you like that? That's yours. Let me carry her for a minute. You sure, honey? She's awful heavy. Just for a minute. Hi. You got her? You like him? Yeah.
