(light music) - [Narrator] Every year, 10,000 brides cross the channel to start a new life in France. (speaks in foreign language) Engineer Dick Strawbridge and his partner, designer Angel, decided to join them. - I'm sure they said that was four euros. They only gave me 50 cents change. (Angel giggles) - [Narrator] But while they thought their budget might stretch to a modest little farmhouse or a gte, Dick and Angel discovered they could dream bigger. (dreamy music) Much bigger. - It's so gorgeous. - [Narrator] This is the story of one family's extraordinary adventure as they tried to turn an abandoned chteau into a fairytale castle in time for their wedding. - We're just excited to see this place breathe again. - [Narrator] They've been through every kind of renovation hell, from plowing through three foot thick walls to plagues of flies. - This has been vacuumed up half a dozen times. - [Narrator] And mislaying their own sewage system. - Where do our sewage pipes go? I'm really hoping this isn't just filling up the basement somewhere. - [Narrator] With just a few weeks to the wedding... - We've nearly killed ourselves. I know everyone's knackered around us. - [Narrator] They still have hundreds of jobs to complete. - Whoa. This could get messy. - [Narrator] The race is on. (upbeat music) Dick and Angel have spent the last eight months restoring the 45 room Chteau de la Motte-Husson, which sits on its own island in the Pays de la Loire. Their castle and 12 acres of land cost them 280,000 pounds and was irresistible on paper. - The writing is just so delicate. I mean, I can't read it. You need a little monocle. - [Narrator] Built on five levels, it has 45 rooms and is so big it could fit nine British new-built houses inside its four walls. But they still found out why these historic monuments are so cheap to buy. They are bottomless money pits. - We're tight. We've loaned money, and everything's expensive here. - [Narrator] Before long, their savings were sunk into a monumental plumbing and heating system. (couple exclaims) But they've still got major works needing urgent attention. - Oh! - That's very, very unpleasant. - [Narrator] It's now autumn. They're getting married in just a few weeks, when 200 guests will be descending on the chteau. They have to speed up even more if it's ever going to be ready in time. - Angela and I do 18, 20 hour days. We get to bed, maybe two or three in the morning. The kids are up at six or seven, and that's our standard day because we know we've got so much to do. (sigh) We're jiggered. (rooster crows) - [Narrator] With his nuptials looming, Dick Strawbridge has just one thing on his mind. Sewage. He's been waiting for a vital report to tell him how to dispose of his waste. - Oh! Hey, this is the (speaks in a foreign language) report, the sewage report, and I think we pay by weight. Obviously it's expensive. - [Narrator] With a houseful of guests due, Dick has to get the system working. - [Angel] Dick, what are you doing? - [Narrator] But all they know from running die through the pipes when they first arrived is that the chteau toilets flush somewhere into the moat. Maybe. - [Dick] Angela, Angela, wherefore art thou? Oh, flushing the loo. There is no red die there. - [Narrator] The report, which cost 500 euros, includes plans for a whole new septic system. - [Dick] See what we're gonna do to our home. - [Narrator] Under French law, they have to make it green and clean within 18 months of purchase or face prosecution. A self-confessed scrimper, Dick hates paying outside contractors for anything. - [Dick] They've arrived. Bonjour. (speaks in foreign language) - [Narrator] But the septic system is way beyond even Dick's skill set. - Bertrand, a big family business down the road, are putting in our septic tank. This week, we should have our sewage, so when we flush the loo, it doesn't go into the moat. That is going to be phenomenal. It may have taken six months to make it happen here in France, but when it does happen, you're really happy. (speaks in a foreign language) - [Narrator] Dick is going to have to prize open his wallet. The job will set him back nearly 10,000 pounds. The 1800 gallon tank is standard for the building, but there's nothing standard about the chteau. Half of the septic system needs to be located on the other side of the moat. To do that, a dam will have to be built for a pipe to be laid. - Now this is basically a settling tank. All of the waste is going to fill up our big septic tank. It will then come through our pump, and our plan says from this pump, we're going to go across the moat over to this field, and we're going to have a sand filter, and as it works its way down here through some pipes, in there as an ecosystem, it breaks it down. Bacteria breaks it down, and what comes out of our overflow here is basically clean water. That clean water can then make its way back to the moat because it's clean. - [Narrator] They'll lay the pipe across the narrowest part of the moat where its 20 feet wide. But standing in their way is more than a million gallons of water and a mass of medieval sludge and the ancient foundations of a medieval castle. - I have to admit I actually twitch when people start digging up around here. There is literally history everywhere. (speaks in a foreign language) Okay, so he has actually found an old wall. We know a drawbridge used to go down over there for the entranceway when this was a fort with a moat all the way around it. The big stones in there are from the old castle that was here. That's real medieval stuff. That's to stop the knights getting in, probably to stop the English. Shhh. - [Narrator] Digging deeper, Bertrand hits another snag. As fast as he empties the hole, it fills up again. - Not surprisingly, because we've got the moat all around, there's water when you dig a very deep hole here. - [Narrator] The pump drains the hole to allow them to create an emergency concrete base. - We're mixing concrete in the bottom now. Normally you add water to your mixture of sand, your gravel, your cement. All we're doing is putting it in there and letting the moat do the mixing. It's happening. - [Narrator] While Dick grapples with the sewage, Angel has taken delivery of an unusual art installation. - It's gonna be like a big explosion, and butterflies are gonna go up the wall and the ceiling, and oh, it's gonna look nice. My one reservation is actually even though I've done 200, I don't know if I've got enough. And every one takes about five minutes. I'm not gonna do the math, but you know, it's a lot of hours. - [Narrator] All this effort is not just for their own nuptials. The couple want to launch a vintage wedding business. The chteau has to start paying for itself or their whole dream could be short-lived. - There's that formula that Dick and I are always harping about that you've either got time or money. But what have we got? We've got neither. We're a bit mental, aren't we? - [Narrator] Angel is hoping that her own unique approach to interior design will appeal to potential customers. The giraffe's not real, by the way. But she still has to convince her groom-to-be. - My final things are arriving. My pineapple light from America has arrived. - It is a pineapple. It's nothing like a sparkly chandelier. - No, I know that. I love it. I know you don't get it, baby. We've always worked by the rule as long as we like it. You know, it's not for everyone. (giggles) Oh yeah, I've always worked to the rule as long as I like it. (giggles) (dreamy music) - [Narrator] There's two weeks to go until Dick and Angel get married. There are still hundreds of jobs that need to be done. They have to speed up. The French team, working on the sewage, are full steam ahead, but over the previous months, the couple have found it hard to pin down French labor. - Trying to get French workers to do stuff for us was so painful, so slow, so expensive. - [Narrator] So their answer is to tap into a whole community of British expert builders who turn up on time and do a full day. - We've had to get some more labor in. We would never, ever have got everything done. I mean, just painting this place is months and months. - [Narrator] People like Steve, a plasterer from Bradford via Normandy, who might give them a fighting chance of finishing this mammoth task on time. - When I first came down that drive there, I just thought, "Crikey, there's gonna be some work there." The size of it. I feel privileged to be working on something like this that hasn't been lived in for a long, long time, and you're putting it back as a family home, the way that it was built to do. - [Narrator] One project at the top of the never-ending to do list is the crumbling balustrade where they want to take their wedding pictures. - As a matter of urgency, we know we need to make this part safe because it's a bit wobbly, and falling off the balustrade would be a bit embarrassing for everybody, or if somebody walks underneath, they'll get a rock in the head. It doesn't sound at all funny, really, when you say it like that. - [Narrator] But finding a French builder to fix the problem has been predictably difficult. - I've got a stonemason who wanted 3,000 euros to fix it, 1,000 euros of which was for the hire of scaffolding for a week, so having asked him to do it, ‘cause we thought, well, I said I'd do the scaffolding, but he could come and do it. Haven't heard from him for three months. Tried emails, phone calls, and can't afford to wait any longer, so the bottom line is doing it ourselves. Steve, the tiling, plastering, painting guru that we've got also does some stonework, so between the two of us, I'm gonna say 3,000 euros, and we're gonna do it in probably two days. I think it's got to come off. - It's got to come off. - Yeah? - It's got to come off. - [Dick] What's interesting if you look inside here, there's a metal going that way. - [Narrator] They iron rods that have been binding the stonework together for 150 years have rusted and expanded, cracking the stone. What they need is some new steel rods to link all the jigsaw pieces together. Dick decides to dismember some of his old British tools. - This is not vandalism, all right? This spanner is good metal, but it's also something made of hard, good steel, and it's imperial, which means it doesn't fit many of the nuts and things over here, and I've got a whole selection of things like this in my work box, and chop this up, and all the sudden, it gets repurposed, and it's useful, and what's more, it saves me money. (grinder whirs) - [Narrator] The spanner was made to be unbreakable. Even Titan Dick and his angle grinder are having trouble. - [Dick] Yes! - [Narrator] The recycled rods are a perfect fit, and a quick-drying epoxy resin secures them in place. - It's a type of steel that won't rust, and hopefully, it's gonna be there for years and years. - [Narrator] Dick's new steel rods are set vertically as well as horizontally so when the stones are laid on top, they will lock in securely. (dreamy music) It's 6:00 p.m., time for the septic team to clock off. - As far as I can tell, they've come, they've sucked, they've built, they've done various basic pieces, but I still haven't got sewage. - [Narrator] But there's no such reprieve for everyone else. The British team works into the small hours to ensure the chteau is ready for its first party in nearly half a century. (tools clamor) (upbeat music) The days are flying by. The expert army is working full tilt, and Angel has her wedding planner hat on. - Right, entranceway, pineapple chandelier, done. Unicorn sidesaddle, a bit foo-foo. Call it a day. - [Narrator] In the kitchen, Dick's slaving over a hot stone, but he isn't making pain au chocolat. He's baking sand. It's an ingenious trick for the balustrade outside. - Dry sand to add to the epoxy mix so it's this color as opposed to being the white mix that we've got and giving it the texture of stone. That's what Steve said, so I'm just agreeing with him. It's dry in here. I'm gonna leave it here until he needs it. It's nice and warm as well. - Right, the radiator needs to be straightened. I've got some alligator skin and fox heads to come in here. - [Narrator] All the rods that Dick's made out of his old tools are set in position so the last pieces of the jigsaw can be put back together. - It sat on there. It sat on the pins. When that sets, it's gonna go nowhere. - It's an awesome fix. - Okay, honeymoon suite. This still needs quite a bit of work, but it's not the end of the world if this isn't perfect. Yesterday I felt really panicked, and today I feel like we're in a bit of a better place. I think we're gonna do it. I've got a lot of cooking to do, and I'm getting my legs waxed today. I'm getting my legs waxed. I'd better go. - [Narrator] The last pieces of the balustrade are returned to their rightful spot. The mortar, which has been mixed with the baked sand, blends with the stone, and Steve fills in the cracks. No guests will be tumbling into the driveway now. - Right, weather forecast. It looks like this next week will be great. One week till the big party. - [Narrator] But the moat is proving to be much more of a problem. A dam that the French team were building to hold back over a million gallons has just burst its banks. - Houston, we have a problem. It's very difficult to stop the water. (speaks in a foreign language) What he means is because we've got enough water to cause an armored knight on horse a problem, we've also got enough water to cause a digger a problem. It's turning into a bit of a major engineering project. I've got a fixed price contract. (wheezes with laughter) Thank goodness for that, hey? - [Narrator] Fortunately, Jean Bertrand does have a plan B. - So now they're making a dam based on a big piece of tarp, and that basically means that it shouldn't flow back in so easily. - [Narrator] The tarp will act as an extra barrier to hold back the medieval sludge while the trench is drained overnight. - I think it will be good. - [Narrator] There is progress being made inside, at least. The chteau is beginning to show her finer side. But Angel is having her own sacrebleu moment. A flower company has reneged on its promise. - The flowers I wanted aren't gonna arrive. It cost me 30 francs. It's ridiculous. Unbelievable. - [Narrator] Angel's wedding bouquet can't be delivered until the day after the ceremony. - I need to order that could get somewhere tomorrow. Is that possible if I placed it now? Well, to be honest, any that you've got. Oh no, I fully understand that. Would it be easier if I just ordered it on the Internet, and then if it didn't come, it didn't come? Because I'm having... Right, okay. - [Narrator] Meanwhile, Dick has worries of his own. He's nervous about the ability of his four working toilets to take the strain of 200 guests. Angela got a quote for some porta-potties, portable loos for the wedding, and they reckoned to get six porta-potties. I think it was for three days. They quoted 1,900 euros. It just makes you shiver. It's just wrong, isn't it? So if I turn this old loo into a men's urinal, it may just work. - [Narrator] A 19th century nobleman might have turned his nose up at a urinal, but for modern vino-swilling Brits, it's ideal. (wood creaks) - That's not a good sound from a joist. I reckon less than 100 euros, one strong one on that side, a piece of wood across there. Next time you see this, it's going to be a pisser. - [Narrator] Expert builder Jay is recruited to install new joists while Dick carves out a plywood floor. In theory, you could just pee here, but I'm putting a bath in. Give the chaps something to aim at. - [Narrator] Trench warfare has broken out all over. A giant ventilation system which is being connected to the new septic tank is also proving a stubborn project to complete. - We have to do a ventilation pipe that goes all the way up to the attic, and of course, it doesn't go up the side, because that'd be ugly, so it's going up all over the place, so there's another hundred meters of evacuation to go. Sewage pipe. - [Narrator] The pipe is meant to trap bad smells and release them up high, but the route it will take is like a map of the Paris metro. - We've gone from the tank all the way through the ground floor, through the cellar, through the back room, through the utility room. We've gone through the back room, which is going to be a cloak room, back through the kitchen. We're up to the first bathroom. We've got another bathroom, and we've got two bits of mudding to go through, so it would be more fun if there was less of it. - Hold on, hold on. - [Narrator] After dozens of phone calls and emails, Angel is making progress. - Yeah, they look good. If I have a preference, I kind of want a muted color or dusty pink. This is good. Just don't even complicate it. Just go for that, yeah. Great, that's brilliant. Thank you so much. Bye. I think, and I don't want to tempt fate, but I think there's someone in Mayenne that has them. You know, she's wasted an hour of my time, and I actually want to have a shower and put some makeup on and feel a bit more brighter than I do at the moment. I had my legs waxed, though. Can you tell? (chuckles) First time since I've been here. (upbeat music) - [Narrator] One set of suppliers who do turn up on time are Angel's favorite faux fur taxidermists from Cardiff. Not content with her safari collection of animal heads, she's also asked them to make a special wedding gift for Dick. - I bought you some plastic, darling, so we could do some more painting. - That's gonna scare the kids silly. That is amazing. - [Narrator] Legend has it that the region's last wolf was shot from a window in the chteau. That wolf stood guard in the stairwell. Today, like so much of the chteau, that myth is coming back to life. - Yeah, oh my god, Dick. I need to take a picture. - [Dick] That is truly amazing. - It's a nice little touch, isn't it? - Little touch? You are joking. It's a bloody great wolf. Darling, I am over the moon. Thank you, you two, for all your work. Can you hear that? (Dick howls like a wolf) (birds sing) (speaks in a foreign language) Who is this man? Ralph, you have sprung up. Big hugs. - [Narrator] In the days leading up to the wedding, family and guests start to gather from far-flung parts of the world. (Angel exclaims) - [Dick] Hello, family. - [Narrator] It's perfect timing as Dick and Angel need all the help they can get. - Are you excited? - Right, tell me your skill sets. - Right. - We'll fill you in on what tasks we've got for you. (all chuckle) - [Narrator] As the chores are divvied out, Dick's mom and his three sisters draw the short straw. - We haven't got time to go shopping, Angela and I, so I'm gonna send my mom and my sisters out. They shopping list has got to be scaled up, and they're going to go and get comfy chicken gizzards for me. (Dick chortles) It's gonna keep them busy. - It's a double trip, in other words. - No, no, it's probably not a double trip. It's probably a monster trip. - Well good, we're wretched. That's something that we can do that's useful. - Get coffee, girls, because I've got to go and get my hair done. - [Mom] Okay, okay. - [Narrator] While Dick's mom and his sisters head for the supermarket, the chteau quickly turns into a forced labor camp, Strawbridge style. - [Dick] See the far side of the moat? - Yes. - I'd like you to put four stakes, six paces apart, and just stop people falling in the moat. - Okay, got it. - [Narrator] Meanwhile, Angel has roped in some of her artist friends to paint the old barn doors, which will be the entranceway to another of her flights of fancy. - This room is gonna be the adult party room. Sophia and Sam, friends from London, are here, doing an illustration which is gonna be the fun house for the wedding. - [Dick] Arthur, what do you reckon of that? Look! - Nice! (Angela laughs) - [Dick] Thank you so much. Great job. Great job, guys. What does the monkey say? (children growl) (parents laugh) (upbeat music) - [Narrator] The wedding is almost upon them. What lies ahead in terms of preparation is daunting, but at least the French have turned up early. - It's just turned 8:00. We wait until 9:30 and hope they turn up. Bertrand's team are actually motivated. With a bit of luck, six months after starting all this, we should actually have flushing toilets, and the team are now coffee'd up and ready to work. (speaks in foreign language) - [Narrator] They're not the only ones who are up with the lark. Angel still has a list of chores as long as both arms, including framing the 19th century plans of the chteau. Okay, so we're gonna have first floor, second floor. Yeah, so the picture will be landscape. - Yeah, good. - We got given the original plans for the house, and I'm so happy with just getting these up. It's like, you know, it is all the finishing touches. That's the bit that everyone goes, "Oh, doesn't it look great?" - [Narrator] Outside, the French are putting their finishing touches to the septic system. The makeshift dam survived the night, and a vacuum tanker is now able to suck up the remaining mud. - Whoa, Bertram. - [Narrator] After burrowing through the moat's one meter thick walls, the team is finally able to connect the leach field to the chteau with a 60 meter long plastic pipe. The leach field is like a tiered French slice cake set into a newly dug trough with perforated piping, a double helping of gravel, a porous membrane, all topped off with a five ton dollop of sand. After the sewage has traveled under the moat and seeped through all those layers, it ends up as clean water which then leaches back into the land. - This system here will be where all the bad stuff comes out of the water. It settles in here. By the time it overflows, it's going to be clean. This time next year, there'll be stuff growing on top of this. This is just gonna be a green field with a little green cap sticking out of it, and they aren't even gonna know we were here. - [Narrator] After six months of planning, 200 hours of work, and the small matter of rearranging a medieval moat, Dick's septic system graduates to legal status with a conformity certificate. - Au revoir, missy. - Au revoir. - We had to get it done before the wedding, and it was a bit hit and miss, but we got there in the end. - [Narrator] At last the wedding is coming into focus and Angel can switch her attentions to the 19th century orangery, one of the seven outbuildings on the 12 acre estate. It's where their wedding feast will take place. - So then that's gonna go in the middle. I'm gonna just do it like this, which is in no order, yeah? But I think it looks sweet. - Yep. Great. - Everyone has their name on the napkins. It's always the little personal details that people remember. Yeah, so get 15 cake plates out in there. So then that's pretty clear, isn't it? So I always get a bit too excited at this point, and then I don't leave any space for food. - [Narrator] Everything seems to be coming together. - The afternoon is wearing on. So many people are working really hard. You know, I don't think there's a single room where there's not an activity. People are cutting up something in one room. People are putting stuff together. We've done a ridiculous amount in a short period of time. - [Narrator] Even Angel's elusive flowers have arrived. - That is not very impressive at all. Let me take a picture of that. I've got to say that is... That looks a bit naff and dead. I just ordered them ‘cause they looked quite good online, but as you know, it's just like ordering a burger from the fast food restaurant. It looks bloody lovely onling, and it turns up, and it's like (beep) I will not use that bouquet. - [Narrator] A second supplier delivers more blooms for the house, but it's too late for her own bouquet. - It's just, you know, half the battle in any business is like, finding your suppliers, finding good people to work with and getting a good team together, and trying to do that with the kids and the wedding, it's just... - [Narrator] After nearly a year of back-breaking work on the estate, there's still a long way to go, but phase one is almost complete. Dick and Angel have just one job left. - [Angel] What do you want me to do? - [Dick] Hold those for a second. - [Angel] Yeah, I could do that. - [Dick] What we're gonna do-- - [Angel] Yeah? - [Dick] Is we hang it up there like that in the middle. - [Angel] That's okay. I would have put it higher. - This is the bits we had. - Okay, I know it is timing. Come on, put it in. - All right, I need you to hold your side. All right, we need to be below there. - [Angel] All right, in here? - Yeah. - [Angel] Careful. - All right, it's in. All right, stand back and make sure it is in the middle. - It's fine. I knew it was. Done. That's fine. That's virtually in the middle. - That's good. - [Angel] It's brilliant. - We live here. It's Chteau de la Motte-Husson. We live here. - It's so cheesy, but we do live here. Come on. - [Narrator] For Dick and Angel, transforming their 45 room chteau has been a true labor of love. They've worked solidly from the depths of winter. - [Dick] I've got to say it's a bit chilly. - [Narrator] Till late autumn. - There's a nine foot drop to nothing. - [Narrator] 16 hours a day, seven days a week. - I think it's an absolute nut job. I think it's crazy. I'm far too old for this. - [Narrator] On top of the 280,000 pounds it cost them to buy, they've spent the best part of 100,000 pounds on renovations and the wedding. - That's the singing Frenchman on our roof. He's whistling. - So we pretend that we've escaped somewhere. - [Narrator] Whatever the setbacks, Dick and Angel kept charging into battle, time and time again. - I think it's necessary. - What a monumental pain in the arse. - [Narrator] And now at last, they can savor the victory. After 40 years of lying dormant, this chteau is finally recovering her poise. Once upon a time, she was damp, derelict, and falling apart at the seams. Then two knights in shining armor came along to rescue her. The kitchen or cuisine was crumbling and covered in mold. Now it has all the comfort and elegance of a grand country house kitchen. Arthur and Dorothy's playroom with its peeling wallpaper and wood infestation is now a palace of the imagination. The dark and dingy grand salon was a neglected chamber with faulty wiring. Now it's been returned to a state of grace and sophistication. And the Chteau de la Motte-Husson with its disintegrating plaster walls and rotting window frames has become a vast suite of rooms, fit for the newly weds. In fact, all the rooms are bursting with warmth, atmosphere, and originality. - [Dick] Are you happy with this bit? - [Angel] Yeah, I'm really happy. - This room, since we came in here. Heated. - [Angel] I know. (chuckles) - Power, lighting. Windows. It's clean. It's painted. I don't understand the paint, but that's your department. And that bathroom's a nice bathroom now, isn't it? - [Angel] Yeah. - Yeah. Right, the hole in the wall. - Da, da, da, you should carry me over when we get married. - [Dick] Are you pleased with it? - [Angel] Yeah. I think it's a lovely, lovely, lovely, lovely room. - I had to make to make all of the pictures in exact lines for you, and just even hanging those bloody umbrellas up there was a pain. - Baby, there's nothing you haven't moaned about in our house because that's what you like to do, just grumpy man. - [Dick] Shhh. Do you remember that day of knocking things down? I think these are officially one room. - I've got to admit, that was one of the highlights. - Destruction? The two of us are witnesses. By the time we've sort of finished your marriage and all the rest of the stuff-- - We're knackered. We're just gonna end up putting the kids to bed and going to sleep. That's the reality. - [Dick] The one place that looks big to me is out here. - Is the entrance, yeah. - The entranceway, yeah, and who'd ever thought we were gonna have two unicorns? - Me. I thought that. Do you know what? I love the pineapple chandelier. I love it. I absolutely love it. - We came in here, and we fell in love with the pattern on there, and for real, our biggest challenge, the rear staircase, the ceiling. - [Angel] Right, I know. That's crazy, isn't it? - Did you ever think we were gonna get it done? - No. (giggles) - No, I didn't. - I'm really looking forward to the wedding, but I'm really looking forward to living here with you. - [Dick] Yeah. - [Angel] I know, we made it happen. I love you. (birds twitter) - [Narrator] It's the day of the wedding, and for once, the master of the house is nowhere to be seen. In true tradition, Dick is staying elsewhere until he takes his vows. - Are you comfy in that? - Yeah, yeah. What Dick's achieved this year has been phenomenal. I mean, the infrastructure of the plumbing, the electrics, the, you know, sewage, that is like a 20 man job for nine months. He has just been so incredible. We have nearly killed ourselves. I've nearly, like, killed Dick. He's wanted everything to be just right and perfect, you know, and so have I. We're really knackered, so I just want to just, like, ah. I am a bit knackered. I know everyone's knackered around us as well. Everyone is knachered around us. - [Narrator] But work cannot stop. (lively music) 200 people need to be fed. Troops of French waiters are amassing in the courtyard and a handful of vintage waitresses have been summoned from across the channel. It's a chance for Angel to step up as lady of the household. - What we're going to need. I need you people to be on the ball all the time, and three people to be in the kitchen all the time. (speaking in foreign language) - Three o'clock when everyone starts to arrive, you're gonna serve them the bubbles. Then four o'clock, you're gonna be over in the orangery, serving the tables, and then the French team are gonna take over. It's very important to keep everybody very drunk today. (speaking in foreign language) - [Narrator] Angel is wearing multiple hats, that of bride, wedding planner, and major general in charge of her domain. - I mean, that's it. That all does seem straightforward, doesn't it? (bell tolls) - [Narrator] It's almost noon, and three miles away, in Martign, the wedding guests are gathering at the town hall. - It's almost compulsory, this kissing. (guests laugh) - [Narrator] Back at the chteau, Angel has finally switched from wedding planner to bride-to-be, and her father Steve prepares to give her away. - All right. - Well, look at you. Well. Ah- ah- ah- ah- choo. (boy giggles) - All right, how are we doing for time? Are they late? - You speak French? (speaks in foreign language) I speak little English. - Come on, I'm not gonna be late because of you. (laughs) - [Narrator] It's exactly five years since Dick and Angel first met. Little did they know their dream would come true in France. - It's right here. Left here, I mean. (horn beeps) Just here is lovely. (everyone cheers) - Look at this. Look at this. Witness this beautiful lady. (guests exclaim) (guests cheers) - [Narrator] The civil ceremony is presided over by the local mayor. After just a few minutes, Dick and Angel are man and wife. (crowd cheers and applauds) (camera shutters click) (horn beeps) Driving back, Angel has one more DIY emergency for Dick. Her special hold-up stockings are being held up with, well, bits of string. - It's just falling down. - Well, where's the string? -Ineeditto hold up the garter. - Where's the string? - Well, you can tie it, but I need them. We've got pieces of tie? - Yeah, I've got two. - No, this one's fine. (guests cheer) - We're married. - [Narrator] The guests are an amalgam of old friends and new, including some of the British builders who've worked on the estate. London plumbers Lee and Kyle know everything there is to know about the chteau. They spent many weeks in the bowels of the building. - This is amazing to see how it's transformed starting in here, for example. - No one knows what we know, do they? - Thanks for giving us your man. We used him enough, yeah? Has it changed since the last time? - Just a bit. - We're getting there. - You almost look cute. - [Narrator] The menu is a mixed patter of British and French rustic cuisine including comfy of gizzards with onion marmalade and rabbit stew with cider. All the produce is locally sourced, including their own chteau-grown quince chutney. - You may notice that we've done a lot of work on this place. Lots more to do. On your plate, you've got a knife, fork, and a spoon. That is your cutlery for eight courses. (guests laugh) We had a choice between plaster or buying you soup spoons. (guests laugh) That's the facts in life. Have a lovely meal, and I hope you thoroughly enjoy yourselves. (guests applaud) - [Narrator] But a handyman's work is never done, and Dick's skills are called upon once more. - [Woman] Come on, Dick. (laughing) - I need my glasses to do this job. - [Narrator] The front door lock plate has come loose, potentially trapping all the guests inside. - Just a little bit of maintenance on the front door. That's how you do that. (dance music) - [Narrator] The first party to be held in the chteau for more than 40 years is a roaring success. The guests are lubricated with fizz, served in vintage teacups, of course. And Dick's pisser is finally christened. - Is that it? - Hang on. - He wants us to pee in the bathtub? - [Guest] I think we have to check and see if there's no towels. (men laugh) - I've heard about the spiders. (men chuckle) - [Guest] We're gonna have a sword fight. (men guffaw) (guests cheer) - Hello, and welcome from my wife and I. (guests cheer) We are so, so pleased to have you here in our house. (guests laugh) It feels like a home. (guests cheer) Nine months ago, we were so naive. (guests chuckle) We didn't know what we were gonna go through, and we put an awful lot of graft into this, and there's been a lot of people helping us along the way, and this place was meant to be full of people having a good time, and Angela and I are loving it. Thank you so much for building our lives. Thank you so much. (guests cheer) (dreamy music)
