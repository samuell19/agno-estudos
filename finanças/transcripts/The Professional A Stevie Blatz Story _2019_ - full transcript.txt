Hi we're here with Stevie in the academy with red, yellow, green and the blue M&Ms In a world that feels they need to be critical, they would maybe describe him as odd But in a world that was nurturing and encouraging, that world would describe him as unconventional, unique and therefore interesting Unfortunately, the social circles that he finds himself in tends to be more cruel than nurturing Good afternoon Good morning, good evening After almost six years of being in entertainment, at 21 years old now I've realized a few things that I have to change You know I was gonna do it all I've currently done over 20 different things You know an amateur professional or you know right around the professional end of things and I thought I'd become a professional and- Things have been a little rough lately and I lost the girl I cared about most You know I can't do this anymore And I'm also gonna change my personality a little bit and that's that So, people can change, just a matter of when you do it Have a great afternoon Now are you okay with being filmed? Because I know she'll probably have to sign a release right? Yeah I have them in the car Like I said lots of game supplies in here, we've got signs that we use for different events Yeah this is all stuff for my Smarty the Elf shows This is the DJ, AV, lighting, photo booths, um... as you can tell there's a lot of stuff in here Make it easier, wheee If you ever feel like you want to put on props during a gig you're more than welcome to That makes it more fun when the attendant has fun Photo booth check lists, this is the red booth, this is gonna be a little different than the black one based on the design "Be calm at all times," that's the tricky part because there's gonna be times you're gonna get stressed out You're gonna have a line of kids or adults and they're gonna be asking you for photos and you're reprinting and you got four people trying to get in the booth and you're gonna get stressed Just take your time and say hang on a second and just kind of go from there So I would have to come here and get the stuff? Yes or if you're local or something, if you're local to the event or whatever I'll just meet you there Yeah there are times when yes, it's all on you So if it was that I would come here, you would give me a list of specifically the colors and whatever to match the event? - Yes, my mom runs operations - Oh, okay So she will meet you here So here we go, same photo quality as the big five, ten thousand dollar booths Which side would you like to grab, that one? Fill out that W9, send it back to me, I'll have a check for you, for today, twenty dollar check for training And we pay more than any other entertainment company around, everyone else is eight bucks an hour, so we're already paying ten an hour Can we take this off for a few minutes? Mic? Yeah, I gotta go upstairs for a couple minutes, just- I could have been gone an hour or two ago! You are ruining the business! I'm losing everything because of you! Thank you! I lost another DJ company now! This business is not going to continue more than six more months I can't! I owe them, I can't... Well I lost another job tonight because I wasn't able to go because of the weather and so the DJ company doesn't feel comfortable working with me so guess what, gone, done - Hello? - Hey it's me So I lost tons and tons of money today, I lost a whole 'nother company who doesn't want to work with me anymore So tell me how to be positive Uncle John because I'm about to lose everything the next few months and be about $30,000 in debt Well, I don't know how you got into this mess My mother wouldn't allow me to drive, she wouldn't allow me to drive an hour or something minutes away It's raining it's pouring it's flooding it's windy it's lightning, good, stay in the house All you've done so far is tell me all the bad things that are weighing on you, you haven't told me anything about what you plan to do in a positive way I don't know, I don't know Well then I will talk to you in a couple days Yep, bye I just keep getting more and more, more and more things keep happening and it just keeps building the debt I'm losing clients, losing events, losing this, that, you know there's only so much one can take And I'm just overwhelmed, overwhelmed Spent pretty much the entire night in the car just sleeping in the back in downtown Bethlehem, and just got home about 20 minutes ago Why did you sleep in the car last night? I didn't want to be at home after all the problems I went through with my mom and dad last night and everybody screaming at me and upsetting me and just starting trouble, midnight I said screw it, getting the hell out So I just drove and I ended up in downtown Bethlehem just for the fun of it Welcome to Chik-Fil-A, how can I serve you? Good morning, I think I'm gonna do a chicken egg and cheese bagel Mmm So you slept in the back here last night? Yep Cozy Yep it was freezing cold Alright Are you charging it to my mom's card or my business account Already did, on her card, that she called Come here a lot? Yeah I'm here, oh God, 10, 15 times a year How much do you charge for face painting? I'm throwing my two-year-old a party, it's Sesame Street themed Okay, piece of cake, when are you looking to have the party? It's April 22nd Uhhhh What happened now? She saw the van, so the lettering worked and man, that'd be great if I could pull in another job for that night at 150 bucks, that would be great, it's local Never gotten into this costume before, so we're gonna see How do I put these on? What up, I'm testing my Batman costume for tomorrow - It should go right across - Nah, I'm packed to the brim Hmm, yeahhh So what, he pays half up front? Yeah he paid a 75 dollar deposit, TECHNICALLY I was supposed to get the 75 now... technically What, you mean the remaining 75? Yeahhh So you were expecting to get paid? I kind of was expecting to get 75 right now, the balance See it gets tough when you're working with another DJ company and you're not a storefront, and it's different, like, I don't know I'm just gonna have to lie to my mom and tell her yeah I got the balance today and that's it and done and not make a deal of it Otherwise if she finds out I didn't get the money she'll be like "are you kidding me, $350 facade?" She'll start trouble like crazy Ah, yeahhh Bunny! I gotta get my bunny stuff, alright, so Oh, oh, my bunny! Oh, oh, my bunny! Oh! Break a move, break it down, come on There's an old saying that, if you find yourself in the hole, the first thing you have to do is stop digging But Uncle John you know a big portion of the problem is my mom I mean she's a big problem I can be as nice as I can be and I can say mom I'm working on it in a nice voice and she just keeps on going and going and going Five, ten minutes later, still going on the same thing Okay mom, I'm literally going downstairs to work, I'm literally on phone calls with clients Oh no no no, you got to do this, you got to do that, pay this bill Today is, I don't know what day it is, but I had the Northampton Community College job fair today Other than that we're at the warehouse right now, we're going to be loading up some concession equipment to go over to the house to be cleaned This table has been back and forth working events for a couple months now and has not been cleaned You know they see the quality you keep, and when you have broken equipment or things that don't look right they really don't like it Yeah baby that's heavy Let's see if Liz got back to me Now your machine is nice and clean and ready to pop again another day Okay this is something that can definitely be in this documentary, for those of you who don't know, I do not tie ties, I just can't You have clip-ons? I used to have clip-ons, and now I went to the zipper tie, they're awesome! Check this out, I want to hold a stock in zipper ties So much fun I love these things So all of your ties are zipper ties? Basically all my ties or they're already like pre-tied, and I just like swing it up, swing it down Do you not know how to tie a regular tie? Never really learned how to tie a tie, I don't tie bowties, I use little clip-on bow ties Uhhh what's new? Where do you wanna meet up? I don't know, what do you want to do? I don't know, you're the one that reached out to me so I thought you'd have an answer Somewhere around Easton, like near the house I'm sure we're hungry again, well Dan's probably hungry, well I'm hungry too Where do you wanna go to eat? I don't know, text me in the next few minutes I want to finish this up, I need like 20 more minutes Alright bye Okay bye What? What did I do now? Don't be jealous that I have friends, other than a cameraman - Hi - Hi - What's up? - What's up? Nothing Could you just order first, then you can- I don't think she's gonna know if the phone is like, if you keep- Did Stevie spent a lot of time on the phone when you hang out? Oh my god, all the time I swear to God He's always saying how he can never have a girlfriend, because his girlfriend is his phone, I mean it goes with him everywhere We lived together for a year and then there were things that happened we're not going to get into and now, we're trying to be friends again, hey! He comes to the house, two o'clock in morning, he's like get out and help me with these chairs, I'm not helping you with these chairs at two o'clock in the morning in a residential area, do you want us to get kicked out? Seriously So the next morning I see these chairs I'm like, you bought these chairs or did they give them to you? Oh no I bought them a dollar a piece, except I'm gonna go get more They were so bad, someone said to him you can't use these chairs So then! He took 15 chairs that were totally good, put him in with the 20 crappy chairs and sold them for a hundred bucks, I'm like like oh my god He doesn't get things! One time we had ants, he didn't know why we had ants, I opened up the cabinet, he left a Cadbury egg opened in the cabinet, it oozed out caramel, there were a hundred ants dead, inside the caramel It's my fault! That was my fault! That was my Cadbury egg, no, I don't eat Cadbury eggs! The point is his decisions or his choices actually cause a lot of aggravation I get anxiety so when I talk a lot, I talk fast and then my chest gets tight and I have to breathe What is going on Stevie? So we got up this morning and saw a really really harsh review on the website, actually on Facebook So we're gonna be following up with some legal action on this guy who screwed me over Finishing up taxes? Yes, still working on the dang taxes Be done very soon, thank goodness Do you want more coffee? No mom I'm good with the coffee Well I could make you an iced coffee No, no, Starbucks, maybe... Social media unfortunately became a problem this morning due to a issue I had with someone else, another DJ a couple months ago, he's trying to screw me over entirely so he's destroying me on Facebook So one of the guys said "Stevie Blatz completely ripped me off, he makes sexual advances towards his help and clients He still lives with his mom and has a bedtime and curfew that affects his business And he stole $50 from us by filing a chargeback on a closed business deal after things didn't go his way" This guy, oh there goes my agent calling, let me take her, let's see Obviously speed is really, really important so when you're able to get in and get out of a unit real quick, it's the same thing with loading and unloading vehicles, setting up, tearing down Literally like a thousand hours behind on work, it's, you're never gonna get caught up It's always something that you missed or something that you need to figure out or do or edit or whatever Toilet bowl is a potty game, it's called potty toss, it's really dumb Toilet seat comes up and it stays and then you literally throw toilet rolls into it Let's see what girls are messaging me today Ahaha! Ha... What is it? A client that I had a problem with, unfortunately she's trying to negotiate some things that I cannot negotiate so... What'd she say? Ummm... Hey we've got a serious problem What? Heather ***** is threatening me, hundred dollars a month, her fiance and a state trooper will be at my house Yes I'm trying to get a hold of Forks Township police to file a harassment case, I guess? I don't know if I should tell you or should I talk to somebody else What's going on? Okay so I run a special events company, I have a client who is harassing me, my address is unfortunately on the contract Things went kind of haywire on Facebook, my social media presence just kind of went in different directions, she was worried, scared, nervous She called me then wanting to cancel her event, this is like the second or third time for various reasons You need to have a lawyer or somebody call me Civil, yeah Yeah civil, yeah I would gladly do $50 a month payments or whatever I need to do but she's now harassing me She texted me the other day saying, "are you still DJing my wedding?" And what's her phone number? I have it right here No he's filming a documentary, I want to give this back to him A documentary on people that want their money back from weddings? No, but all this that happened- Apparently I've done something pretty achievable over the years so we're doing a film Good This is, this is what I have to deal with, I don't just give out money for things and then they come back to me three months later wanting another 100, 200 bucks And it would have to be with your business check, not cash, which she can say you didn't give me... Ohhhh, that came down Hope it doesn't rain, otherwise the ground, phew, it'll be brutal Oh there's no way, I do it with an extra person Yeah I tried doing it like once and I'm like no, had to call somebody else A lot of rental companies just send it out and that's it, they don't send people to do it Oh there we go, there we go After this rental I gotta go to the tax accountant, deal with that, but other than that And then you go to Washington DC? And I go to Washington, yep Awesome Yeah these tent rentals are fun Say goodbye Goodbye We do not give out prizes to kids under the age of 5 without a parent present so they will not choke, that's a big one, big policy I have Oh there's more fishies, I was wondering what I bought Fishy! Ahaha! You're calling at the wrong time! Mom listen, I am running, I'm racing, I've got eight more things to do like in four hours Hey Pat, is Tony graduating college this year? - No - Oh Anything new since last week? What is that like a unicorn bark? Yeah! You want a bag for that? No I'm just gonna eat that right now It's amazing, another DJ, "in search of a driver for May 13th, DJ wedding gig 2:30-8 p.m. if you can help me please message me as soon as possible" How do you book a gig and you don't have any transportation? Ridiculous Hey Grandpa, it's little Steven can you call me back or answer the phone, I have some things to talk to you about Hello Steven what's the matter Hello, okay so I have great news, check came today so I'm depositing it and I'll have money for you, it looks like either tomorrow or Thursday Also, I need to rent your mower and trimmer for Thursday, I have a- My trimmer, we received it and it was broken, I have to bring it back I know, mom took care of that, she should have had a new one No, she didn't, it's still in my garage, how can she take care of it? Oh my Goooosh. She said she has the receipt but don't know what to do, so I'm gonna give it a shot and see if they'll give me a new one Alright I'll let ya know Alright, bye Ughhh Ugh, jeez! So, Stevie Blatz Entertainment has everything but the kitchen sink, or do you have a kitchen sink? - No, no kitchen sink - No kitchen sink yet, okay I don't think there is ever an actual roof of success I think it just keeps going, like the universe, just keeps going First explain how people can get in contact with you I got to know you because I was following your vehicle and it was a red light and I got a chance to get my camera ready and take a picture of the back of your van Now I know that the van works! It did, oh yeah See, my mother didn't understand the $300 investment on that There you go! Stevie you know I have to do all this quick because you have the possibility of disappearing, you know with magic, I mean you could disappear right out of here No that's usually what I do to the ladies I could turn around and, "where'd Stevie go?" - I make the girls disappear - Right! But the funny part is, I'd say 90% of my comedy is my love life or just stupid ridiculous things that happen to me I haven't put together an actual routine, practiced it and gone on a stage and perform it, it's very improv I can come up with things off the top my head and make fun of people and make fun of my life and... Last-minute meetings are like, they make your day and they really show possibilities Make as many connections as you can, that's my philosophy I'm ticked off because I have, my mother doesn't, she persuaded my grandfather not to allow me to use his lawnmower and trimmer for a $75 lawn job tomorrow Why did she persuade him to do that? I have no idea, pain in the butt You can't keep borrowing everybody else's stuff- I'm not borrowing I'd give you like ten bucks, I'd give you money, something, at least I'd make sixty, sixty-five dollars, not have to be four hundred in the hole Call her up- She's at work I can't- You're doing things stupid-ass again You know you had to open up your mouth to Grandpa and start trouble so now more money away from debt No, no, no! You can't- I'm sorry I could have made you $60 to my debt I feel badly for him, I feel badly for him because like I said before he just wants the same things the rest of us want You know, the unconditional love There's not a lot of joy and happiness in his family, my wife and I are probably tops on his list of who he feels loves him And so I agree to do things like this! Okay Little flower Saw my flower? So we are in New York City, this is the first time for me to perform in New York City, we're going to be doing some busking, some magic and some comedy and who knows what else Let's see what we got here Hey guys, could you help me out with a straitjacket escape?

Well a $950 unit I bought for like 90 bucks I think Stevie is, like, such a staple of Lehigh Valley entertainment, I think you'd be hard-pressed for anyone to remember exactly when they met him, he's like everywhere and everybody knows him He's not afraid to do things that other people wouldn't, he's not afraid to embarrass himself That's one of the, that's one of the things about him I like What's it like working with him? Oh it's awesome, it's a lot of fun, you never know what to expect He's a deep person and I think his external manifestation of that is funny and outgoing What do you think he could improve on, what are some advice or tips you could give Stevie? Stevie's not a fan of advice or tips Welcome! A wedding is a wonderful celebration The commitment you make today will be the foundation on which you will build your life together Hi January, I'm Stevie, the guy who does everything Hi Steve, it's so nice to meet you How you doin?

I don't know if that's good, oh God Well I did see her photo or something the other day so there we go! Now she's typing again Touch the top of your screen, there we go "Hey I'm good how are you doing?" Your call has been forwarded to an automatic... Leave her a voicemail Hold on she messaged me Oh she can't pick up the phone, she's in a breakroom with 15 other women Oh, there she is! She's calling! Hi Stephanie, how you doing? We just met with a client and her family and this is a lot of fun because we're gonna be doing their sweet 16 next Saturday It's a little over a week away and they've ordered a ton of stuff DJ, balloons, photo booth, uplighting Ok, hold up, we're not advertising Well, I- Tell me what's going on Made about little over a thousand dollars and a pretty good day, it's an easy Saturday in July What kind of money do you have to pay out? Probably only a couple hundred with expenses and stuff like that, just paying off labor and photo booth supplies, and- I'm tired I know, this heat- We're gonna go over to Forks community park and play basketball in a little bit Outside in this heat? Like twenty or thirty minutes yeah, I'm gonna school these boys! It's brutal out! You gotta be kidding Mom, 84 million Americans play basketball in 95 degrees in Philadelphia and New York City every day, in LA, nine months out of the year it's a hundred degrees in LA and they play basketball Just don't get sick and call me tonight I'm not, air conditioning feels good Great, let's go call these life coaches Pete's Dragon, original 50 inch... I think he spends, he looks ahead like all this rentals and all now like why are you buying the stuff if you don't have the booking? "Well I want to promote it" You know the thousands of dollars, he probably could have had my debt paid off! I don't mind giving and giving, if I say I'll pay for it, okay But it snowballed into this enormous, so many accounts that I had to put them into one account! And he's always telling people that I'm on him for the money I am NOT on him for the money but then when he cries and says he doesn't have money for something but then you're going out and you're buying all this stuff that you buy? He's buying dishes and glasses and champagne, he wants to go to a venue and be able to say, and I'm like, you have hundreds of dishes and all this And then I said to him "Who's gonna clean them when you're done?" You think you're gonna bring dirty plates and cups here, in my house, germs and we're gonna clean dishes and stuff Why are you doing that? Some of what makes him... him is that he's not disciplined And I wouldn't want to take that away from him So that unconventionalness, that uniqueness, that's all very very attractive and I would even argue the world needs more people like that But the inability to focus is what I think keeps tripping him up Now, I think what you described a moment ago about sort of deconstructing the day... You did this, you did this and this happened and this happened, how does that make sense? And then before that, you gotta get him to focus! Good morning You know he's downsizing? I heard I'm selling stuff and he's like no you can't sell this, you can't sell that, I'm like Steven, don't go back the other way! Trying to wake up still Nice to see you Nine thirty, ten o'clock in the morning Wanna throw this on? Yeah Yep, we're good What's wrong with the trunk? I don't know, we have no idea just won't stay up, sometimes it stays up, sometimes it doesn't, no idea So tell me about your stand-up comedy career, is that still going? I think that's kind of done with for now I can't fucking wait for this to be honest You're never gonna see this, unless he comes back next week, probably never gonna see this again But everyone put your hands together for Mr. Stevie Blatz Hello! Well hello there everybody, how you guys doing? Well my name is Stevie Blatz, I'm the grilled cheese guy and I happen to have an addiction with grilled cheese And this is what happened about two or three years ago and this is why my name is now the grilled cheese guy I used to say I loved grilled cheese more than sex, I never even had sex, but grilled cheese were a lot better Well then a little while later I had sex with, uhhhh, no I didn't have sex, because my mom's gonna watch this I did not, but I was thinking of it And then what happened was... My priest is probably gonna see this Well, we'll move on! So forget about that, I need a couple of seats because I have some very special guests here tonight Speaking of my mom and dad... Yeah they were nice enough to lend me some replicas of themselves So we're just gonna sit these guys up, because I think it's only nice to have family in the show So here we go, this is my dad, striking resemblance actually, it's got the mustache, well he used to have a mustache Justin Bieber has a back-up plan and it's very simple, he's gonna own Bieber Bus Lines "We don't monkey around, we get you to your destination just... in... time" - Thought of that myself - Boo! I don't have a girlfriend and I turned five of my ex-girlfriends lesbian so clearly I don't have a chance with them So this is what I do So actually we really met over two years ago, it was at the Sands Casino and he was dancing his butt off And he was sweating! And he comes up to me he hits on me! I thought he was an amazing dancer but once he opened his mouth I thought he was cocky as hell, sorry So how long until he opened his mouth? How long was he dancing, how long when you saw he was an amazing dancer to the point where- Once the music stopped then he came over and I felt sweat, I don't like saliva or anything I got a little bit on my face and I was like oh my God I don't even know you and you just touched me with your saliva Headin to Texas Roadhouse for a networking lunch Tell me about it Well for 20 bucks you get to network and eat ribs, I like that, and fries More or less kind of just explaining to everybody that the main entertainment company is gonna be shut down in January, which is pretty much everything except for DJ and photo booth So the next step is just kind of rebranding to just DJ and photo booth next year It's almost like retirement of 80 percent of what I do but it can't possibly be retirement a hundred percent This is my new little speaker, my little baby, six hundred dollars with a warranty Alright, if anybody's looking to buy anything I've got tons and tons of items, party rental items, tableware, everything you think of, I mean I have like three warehouses full Say that again I hate parallel parking! So what are we doing? Getting food Would you like a bag? Yeah, might as well toss it in a bag Why am I paying, wait, why am I paying X amount last year and you're telling me there's an extra 100 for what? Stevie? I don't know. You don't know, you better know, throwing away money like this Wait, what are we talking about? - You said- - The $100 extra is for booking agency Alright so now I have to change it so it probably is 485 again With the booking agency thing, yes Nooo, no no no no! No I already explained this to him! It was 350 plus a hundred for booking agency Who are you talking to there? - God I swear this is like murder - When you fill the application online- Save the money! Because if something happens and you're out- - No no no! - tens of thousands you'll regret it! And I won't close my company, the government can come after you Fine Fine! But you stress me out and you waste my time and you bring me into situations that I don't need to be a part of Oh, help me Mom can you put some air on? Air conditioning? His mom is... Tough, sometimes tough to deal with even by my standards She has called me about some things that Stevie has been involved in and basically said I have nobody else to talk to We would describe it as "pressured speech," meaning that she would talk 4,000 words in 10 seconds And you say well stop a second and let me tell you what I think, she just keep talking To the point where you almost have to get rude Now if I feel that way, and I am reasonably rational, I gotta believe that when she gets on one of those rolls with him, it's incredibly overwhelming to him And his only recourse is to stomp around the house Say I'm gonna kill myself, I'm gonna get in the car, you know Just escalates the drama of that because he doesn't know how to disconnect or de-arm that pressure that she puts on him Oh, you know, I asked my mother to take this back, not even gonna happen today So what's new man? What's going on? Oh not much, just rebranding How's that going? Good, we're selling a lot of stuff which is phenomenal My love life is still as pathetic as it was, so it, you know what, it is what it is How's everything going with you and your mom? You guys were fighting a lot last time I was here Yeah mom and I are gonna fight constantly We got into a really crazy argument the other night What about? I don't even remember, it was stupid, it was stupid, of course And of course Liz the ex roommate and I are fighting - Again? - Again About? Dumb stuff, rehashing stuff from over a year ago and- Let me guess, you owe her money Oh yes she wants all of her money right now, she's like just pay me monthly Okay that's our agreement, you're being paid monthly I made a comment yesterday I'm like I got $100 to spend on girls and alcohol and I'm going out and partying and for some reason I told her I don't know why And it was like, my money, my personal money, I can do what I want with it You know it shows her I have a personal life, you know like I'm doing stuff, I'm not complaining on Facebook, I'm going out and enjoying life She's upset with me, like you're never gonna change and this and that and I want my money and- You're gonna get your payment at the end of the month like you do every month There were things that were done and I'm not going to get into it but like, you know, Stevie and I, we, we definitely got close We weren't in a relationship, but you know he was my best friend and, and I really cared about him, but then he hurt me I just got out of a relationship that was hindering and I was still getting abused so he was like fun and light and caring and entertaining, who I could sing karaoke and I can be free with Then sometimes he wouldn't come home late at night and then he would just sleep in a Walmart freaking out whatever, like oh my life is over And he'd always talk about his ex-girlfriend, there was no way I could have a relationship, I said you know Stevie, I care about you but when we hang out and do things and then you go and say you miss your ex, I mean, how do you expect to like go from that? That's when my guard went up and so he did say he loved me and then he took it back and that was the end of it And then I said to him I've been hurt too many times, I'm not playing this game and that's it And he always kept talking about wanting to get married everything like that, he keeps picturing things and I'm like, I'm like Stevie You're in your own delusional world, I said, your own Stevie world, you need to get out of it because I said you're gonna be only one that's left Happy birthday Yup, 27! You made it! Yeah, haha That's scary Who's the new girl in your life? Uh, eh, ehhh... So this is a baptism contract and deposit So I see in there there's some fine print that you can't throw any of the costume characters into water Now I'm going to assume that you've been thrown into water in a costume character- No I've almost been, but I've actually had other character performers that have been in that situation or have heard of it Yeah so that's a big one because if you're in a big costume or any of the mascot costumes, you get thrown into water, it's a massive safety risk because if you can't pull yourself out quick enough or you get 50 pounds worth of wet costume, you're drowning I have to call this bride because I don't believe I actually have her planning forms other than just a song list so I gotta handle that So how's everything with you and your mom? Eh, alright Good? Eh, it's okay You know, still a pain in the butt I mean the biggest thing with Sam is that she saw all the calls and the texts and I mean it's like how many times a day does my mom have to bother me for stupid stuff? Or ask me what I'm doing or where I am or, I mean, this is why these girls, they don't want me because I'm not living out on my own My mother is all over me non-stop It's a turn-off! Have you considered just not answering the phone? She'll find me She'll track me with the police, I swear She's nuts in the head! Are you doing landscaping today? No, not today it's crazy, I gotta do this wedding prep, that's more important Alright, hold up, come over here Oh God, ooooh! Exercise! Birthday boy! Out of breath birthday boy What are you getting done, Stevie? Getting rid of all the props and costumes I just bought, but check out the baby girl costume, show him that Now I own the both of them No, I'm gonna use it for kids parties and stuff I'm gonna bring that out to your family party There's still money in it Stevie I don't think I've ever seen you wear a hat I normally don't Starting to like it He looks like you So what's your name? Tanner Kidd, K-I-D-D Do you see yourself working with him long term? Right now, I'm kind of looking at long term but I'm also looking at short term Landscaping is gonna be ending so we're gonna be going into snow removal I don't know how much snow removal we're actually going to be doing I believe that he should be focusing on profitability, not size And so I think his effort to be bigger and better than he actually is gets him into trouble He was going to have a window washing business in Georgia! We were talking, he came down to visit, we were talking and I said you know this is a brand new community, they're still doing lots of construction They're digging in this ugly Georgia clay, it creates a lot of dust Look at those windows, I can't even see out of them! And I said you know what, you ought to do is you ought to be a window washer down here, you can make a lot of money! Boom! He was off and running Very quickly he said, "I got the name of the company already!" What's the name of the company? "It will be Peachy Clean Windows" I said Peachy Clean Windows... Wow! That's his talent! And now the world famous Stevie Blatz all the way from Bethlehem, Pennsylvania Alright boys and girls, are you guys ready to party rock? You might have to help me with this So tell me, what's going on with your mom? Oh she is a royal pain in my butt because she's bothering me about money Came home after working a party, you know, long day, long night and I don't know what time I got home, some time after, what, eleven o'clock I get in and she's not even, not even 20 minutes and she's starting about money I'm like, I just worked, I have more hours of work to do tonight, and, starting trouble And then it just blew up after 30, 40 minutes it just got worse and worse, I'm yelling and screaming my head off, like shut up I just want to work and handle what I need to handle and go to bed in an hour And she's just screaming at me and then she took an iPad and threw it, hit my ankle and it's been hurting since then, and it's just a nightmare Like my stomach, I have muscles in my stomach that is like expanding and contracting really fast for a couple of minutes, like several times a day, and it's like What am I getting, is my appendix going, am I getting an ulcer, what, what's the problem? And 90% of it, stress! I don't even, like, what else do you offer- Well you get chips and a pickle with your sandwich- So give me a call back when you get a chance or shoot me a text that'd be greatly appreciated, alright bye-bye Hello What's up? What's up man? How are you? Entirely aggravated. What happened, your girlfriend has work today? Yeah, and I told her to find a babysitter but she don't listen to me You need 10 bucks? Dan, have you ever had the moment where you lose your entire binder of bookings? We had that happen the other night, like where the hell did it go We're trying, yeah we have everything like in binders and then we also scan everything in a Google Drive I'm answering a lead right now so- What? I'm answering a lead What happened? So, my mom decided to clean up and in doing so she's like, you don't need this it's dirty, it's nasty, da da da It's made me tons of money and made me famous My entire box of broken glass, in the garbage! So now I told her I said all the glassware we use, you know, we were gonna do for concessions and rentals, I'm gonna break it all and guess what, two cases of broken glass right here So it's cleaner, it's nicer, it's new so it's not like dirty old bottles Is there anything you have to do to prep the glass to walk on it once you break it? No, not really So I could take that, I could smash this on the ground and you could walk on it? Yeah piece of cake Prove it Well I can't do it now, we really got to go, like I got 3 minutes Prove it, this is huge, I don't believe it I'd rather put, maybe a couple more in there That is real glass folks Let me get a couple more How come you're adding more? I'm gonna add more so it puts more in here, makes it a little bit better It's obviously not, like, real walking because that's the way it is but- Stand on it, stand on one foot Can you do that blindfolded? Oh yeah I could do it blind, it's feel, yeah, that's what it is I kind of know like where to position my feet so What do you think, Tanner? You think he can stand on that? Yeah, it's not that sharp. I will be shocked if that doesn't go through your foot Just have to stand on it at a certain angle You ever walk on fire? No, that one I'm good, no thank you Stevie would be too scared I wouldn't be too scared! I'm not scared of anything, other than talking to girls We good? We got everything? Cuz we gotta hustle! Alright, so we're having at noon an interview with the producers out in the United Kingdom A production company out of England saw the video that somebody took on UK mail, or Dailymail, online They saw the video of me walking on broken glass in New York City and this was months ago They're putting together a TV show of like stunts and stunt performers all over the world so this is kind of cool that they've accepted me, and so we're gonna talk and negotiate a few things and you know hopefully if all goes well they'll put me on the show and see what happens Mom, did you fix the heat? Oh please answer Okay that's done, now I gotta get the computer Hey Neil what's up? So I invested in a truck, I invested in, you know snow blower, more equipment, mowers, the whole nine yards Alright Skype come on baby, work for Daddy! That's clearly not working What is wrong with Skype right now? I don't have it downloaded on this computer So download it, it'll take two seconds I have two minutes left, this is gonna be fun That's not working Garbage bags, seriously mom? Alright see you later! Awesome, I really wanted to say cheerio "See you later", so American Yeah so we just had the interview which took a very long time, that was like an hour So it looks like I'm gonna be on TV in the spring, we're waiting on all the final, you know, stuff going on here, they're going to edit the interview and the audio and video and all that so we're gonna see what happens in the spring, but it looks good, be on TV! It's gonna be fun If Dan did not email me with that crazy idea of filming a really good documentary, it wouldn't have happened So you know sometimes taking chances is a good thing I could have responded back and said no I'm not interested or you know whatever but my thoughts were give it a try I don't know life, is just really weird and interesting, so... Test test test Test one two You're on! What's goin on? It's a day after snow removal, I'm exhausted Got up an hour ago to answer calls and emails and texts from one snow removal client that wasn't happy, her driveway didn't get done! How we missed that, I don't know, but- So what's the deal, you have a client that you're supposed to visit any time it snows? Correct, yeah So how many clients do you have right now? We have about seventeen, eighteen So if it snows you have to see all 17 of those clients? Yeah Did you ever sell your drum set? No, I think we're gonna keep it Why? I kind of want to play it again My mom was gonna put it up for sale again and I'm like- Okay, then why don't you sell it to me? Because I want to play it Yeah, but you had it for sale! I know and we took it down! Somebody offers me 300 bucks I'd be like screw it Okay, so I'll buy it for 300 bucks So Juliana is the new girl in my life who, I haven't really talked to her, we've never met apparently, but we haven't talked since 2013 and, she wants to go to Ikea, hey I like the food court there I'm tired This is the easiest way to do invoices, I don't get all fancy, like everybody else wants me to I'm just emailing one of the chiropractors, we do their office, their lot, and it was just telling her, like, I'll be sure to stop by over the weekend if I need to lay any more salt or anything like that, um Hello? Good morning my favorite person in this entire world! Oh no no no no nooo, what do you want? Hey if I throw plenty of money at you, ha ha! Okay, so I made a really bad mistake Is there a way that you can get to Luther's and finish the tree job? I mean I could possibly get up there but it might, it's just gonna be tight You, you never stop, hold on, hold on Ughhh I thought we would have had more to do today but, kinda screwed up day Oh I gotta give you your mic Yes Yeah there's not much anymore to really film He tends to take like more than he can handle sometimes, and it's cuz he knows he can call me and I'll have his back I think Stevie has what a lot of business owners get, which is this inability to turn work away, to the point where the job will then become unprofitable, so if he says he's going to do it, even if he ends up losing money he still really works really hard to do it What is today? Where are we? Friday, January 12th This Apple watch is fun because it's like telling me every 20 minutes all this stuff about staying busy and standing up like every hour Do you ever want to move out? I'd love to move out again but right now I'm just enjoying my life, I moved out for a year, did all that You know if I'm gonna spend 6, 7, 800 dollars a month living somewhere, it's gotta be with a roommate that isn't crazy, first of all, and crazy landlords so- Holy Chicken McNuggets Hey I was talking to the editor and we're thinking about, like the last shoot, maybe a New York City shoot with Rel? Very last day, what do you think? Ehhh I don't wanna go back to New York City Why? What happened? I thought you liked it Ehhhhh, not really, I would rather go down to Philadelphia My hope for this film would be to show all Americans, but mostly teenagers and kids, you could start a business at a young age and be something 10 years later I don't really think I would change anything, not off the top of my head You know maybe if I thought of some things- So all in all you're happy with your experience? Yeah, I came into this project knowing that there's gonna be times where I'm gonna get mad, I'm gonna freak out, I'm not gonna be satisfied, I'm not gonna be happy, I don't want certain things in the film, I'm gonna say things that catch me off-guard But this is documentary, this is media, this is life and you know what, if people can't see every aspect of my life, public, then why do it? So yeah I'm not perfect and believe me I've recognized that 100x over We're what? We're not, I think we're done, yeah we're gonna keep 16, 18 and then 20 for solely landscaping because- I don't think so, cuz when we when we expand out a little bit more on the landscaping company and put another mower or two in there and some other stuff and more equipment... I don't think so, I mean my total is like four hundred and thirty dollars a month, something like that I think it's like three hundred dollars for, almost 300 for the two entertainment units, and it's like 140 for the landscaping unit So I could, that's, that's fine, I mean you know it is what it is Where'd you get these shelves? Home Depot, I opened up a card there, a credit card, I have a $500 limit I only spent $130 for one unit, oh well the other unit I spent $140 Cords cords and more cords! Ugh, this has to be fixed The back is all screwed up - Want me to move? - Yeah. I want to see if I can put this under here, ah, it won't fit, crap-a-zoid What's your $1200 mixer? It's called the QSC touch mix, it's awesome, it's a digital mixer When you getting that? Probably in a few months I realized it wasn't like a necessity right now, so I didn't buy it, I'm smart, I bought the Apple watch, you know it's one or the other And I don't need that mixer right now Yeah I'm smart, I bought the Apple watch instead What do you mean? I know my investments, I know my budget And I planned out to buy an Apple watch but I was thinking I was gonna wait a few more months, I decided to buy it now But the touch mix, I mean I could go buy it anytime I want, I have the really want to get more into debt Yeah Sweating my chicken wings off So about six months ago what did you have in here? All the entertainment stuff No, what kind of landscaping equipment did you actually have? I didn't have like a lot, any of this, I had the mower, all these tools here - Show me one by one - This snow blower - This is brand new? - Yep hasn't been used yet - What did this cost? - Seven hundred and thirty dollars Whoaaa I mean my goal is to get an actual bigger trailer, not like a van, a trailer, and closed so that way I can move stuff quickly and I can do a lot more but you know right now, I, you know, slowly but surely But we got to get rid of a lot of this stuff, all this entertainment stuff My Council to Stevie has been and will continue to be... ...be a DJ And you already know how to do that really really well and stop trying to get everybody else to do it for you Most of my conversations by telephone with him end with my saying, "Well, you know more about it than I do" We're excited, today's been a great day, I did an Easter Bunny appearance at a church in Allentown And so now we're heading down to Philadelphia, we're gonna go check out Independence Hall, and it's gonna be a great Sunday Yesterday I did a cheerleading competition that was, that was a new experience for me, never did that before So um, 12 hour long cheerleading competition was, um, that was exhausting You would think it wouldn't be, but- So what's going on with your mom? So my mom's not happy with this project, with this documentary, like she's done with it She doesn't want, doesn't anything more to do with it, doesn't want a camera in her face, she doesn't want anybody in the house anymore so... She was a basket case last week, when we came back from Vegas when she found out that we were gonna film on Friday she was like "no I'll stay up for 24 hours if I have to, clean and do things and move, whatever, no, nobody's coming in this house" and she was furious What is she upset about as far as the documentary? She doesn't think I'm gonna make tons of money off of it, she wants me to make lots of money, it's all money with her Does she think that this documentary ate into your time? Maybe, but I don't really care, like, doing my normal stuff What changed though? Because I haven't seen you in probably two months so like- I think she's just tired of it, I think she just doesn't think I'm gonna make any money off of it Whoo, that was a fun drive This is kind of like my home area here, never been down this part of town, Independence Hall This has been something that I've been wanting to do for many years, finally got the chance to do it, and I mean this is the birthplace, this is American business right here, you know, Ben Franklin who was definitely one of my heroes and mentors This is the birthplace of business and economy right here The Signer, the course of history changed with the signing of the Declaration of Independence in 1776 Alright, so they closed down this entry point, so we go around to the other side So we'll have to cross this way Uh, it's kind of cool to have something, memories, and to have people see the things that I've done in business and entertainment, so... You know every day it's a constant improvement, it's something new or different and I just keep going from there, so I don't know if I'll ever be a millionaire but at least I know what I'm doing is right and at least I know that every day somebody is happy, somebody's having a great event and you know that's important to me, you're not gonna please everybody I think my biggest accomplishment is probably that I didn't close the business the four times I wanted to close it, and that I just kept going and I mean I'm here today so, I just keep pushing And I know that there's another event down the road that's gonna be bigger and better And if I quit now then I won't be a part of that and ultimately going to the places I've been to and experiencing the things I've gotten to experience, I don't really know what the biggest and best thing that's gonna happen to me tomorrow you know or that call that you're gonna get that you're gonna DJ at the White House, I mean, you just never know And those are experiences that I've been wanting for years and since I started and so I'm just going to keep going until I can't really go any more I'm definitely living the American Dream, if I wasn't then I wouldn't be given all the cool opportunities that I've been given So I think everybody has an American dream, I think whether you're in business or you're working that nine-to-five job you're always striving for something greater, you're always trying to pay off a bill, or you're trying to keep the lights on or do something for your kids So really the American Dream is every single thing that really exists with living in America To think, right back there, hundreds of years ago this is how America was started We've come a long way and we got a long way to go but this is pretty cool I do want to get a selfie so I gotta get that on film He couldn't handle what I was saying to him anymore, it was- He's too worried about entertainment business during a busy week of a landscaping business But I don't know why he fired me because I wasn't the only one telling him this Our other employee was telling him this, his mom was telling him this, Mary was telling him this, multiple people were telling him that- You have to worry about landscaping during the summer, spring, fall, you can't worry about, oh let me take a photo booth job and then somebody backs out, you're gonna have to tell the person "I don't have anybody and I'm working landscaping" Not stop work at two o'clock in the afternoon and then complain the rest of the week "well we're behind, we're behind" He has taken some projects where he grossly, grossly underbid And as goofy as Stevie is and the drama that's on Facebook and the mistakes that he makes- Stevie... he has an energy and an honesty and a purity about him that you should see in more people And he can fire me every day for the next month, piss me off, get in an argument with me over money and I'm always gonna have his back At the time I did think Stevie was the love of my life, but, I came to realize that he was never going to change
