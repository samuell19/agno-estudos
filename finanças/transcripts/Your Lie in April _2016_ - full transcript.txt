Hey. What color is your world right now? Why don't you play a little more seriously? I'm not really playing. What are you doing, then? A part-time job. I'm transcribing a pop song to sheet music. I'm just checking the final draft. You can still play like you mean it. I don't play anymore. But you are playing. I'm burning up! It's only April, and it's scorching hot! This place revives me! This isn't your club breakroom. You in a bad mood? Wait! Did I interrupt a romantic marital moment? We're not married! You're even in sync! Shut up! We're just old friends! Do you intend to injure the star soccer player? -Absolutely. -I'm sorry! I'm gonna hit you! Wait! Stop! Tsubaki and Watari always shine. Their world is full of color. But... My world... is black and white, like these keys. This girl has a huge crush on you. So, she asked me to introduce you. Are you sure she's cute? She is, I swear! I told her you'd meet her this Saturday. You should come too, Kosei. Why me? Because you're always free. Well... Come on! We've known each other since first grade. Keiko? What's up? Really? Okay, I'll be right over. Sorry! Keiko is calling me. What a player. He's a good guy, though. So will you come on Saturday? I'll be a third wheel if you don't come. Okay? Come as "Friend A." Please! What for? Please! All right. My horoscope was amazing today. My lucky food was takoyaki so I'm making some tonight. That's Hiroko's car. Lucky! You'll eat good tonight. See you tomorrow. -I'm home. -Hi. We're making hamburgers! You didn't have to. You're busy preparing for your recital. It's fine. Your dad asked me to make you a hearty meal once in a while. You don't have to worry about me. He's worried because he has to be away for work. A new release? My gift to you. Thanks. I'll go change. Kosei. Did you greet your mom? I'm home. They're late. Don't they know the "arrive five minutes early" rule? "Town Musicians of Bremen." It's so windy! What are you doing, peeping tom? You took my picture! You pervert! Give me your phone! I'll destroy it! It's a misunderstanding! Kosei? Kao? Tsubaki! This is my classmate, Kaori Miyazono. Hello. This is Ryota Watari. Nice to meet you! Same to you. This is "Friend A." Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you... Let's go. -Where to? -The Music Hall. Kao is entering a violin competition. I'm a violinist. Cool! We'll cheer you on. Tsubaki, I'll pass. Why? Let's go! YOUR LIE IN APRIL I can't hear... I can't hear! I'm scared. Kosei! Over here. Isn't that Kosei Arima? -I think it is... -It's him! The virtuoso? He was called, "the human metronome." Hey, superstar. Why didn't you tell me? Because... You wouldn't have come otherwise. So... I did my best to keep my mouth shut. But it's the violin. The violin! Why does everyone play the same song? It's a required piece. I'm bored. And sleepy... You've been asleep since it started. Kao is next. Finally! Go for it, Kao! Kao! May it reach you. She's kinda cool. It sounds totally different from everyone else today. Her tempo and articulation... She's totally ignoring the notations. What is this ridiculousness? She's insulting the composer! Such a nonsensical performance isn't fit for a competition. But it's interesting. Why? How can she be having so much fun? Kosei. Kosei! Kosei. How many times do I have to call your name? Oh, sorry. Here. For coming on Saturday. Thanks. You're in a daze. Are you in love or something? Why would you think so? Is it Kaori, by chance? I know. She's cute. No way! She has a crush on you, remember? That's irrelevant. It's natural to be attracted to a girl in love. A girl in love is radiant. You fall in love despite yourself. I think I can see why girls like you so much. Only just now? But I can't. Whether you can or can't... is for the girl to decide. You really know what to say. I know. Hello, Maki? Do I have practice today? No! Karaoke? Just you and me? Sure! Friend A! What a coincidence. Going home? Oh yeah. How was my violin performance? It was out of the question for a competition. But... It's hard to explain... It was really good. How do you like that? Where's Watari? Aren't you with him? Oh, he... has practice! I was waiting for him. Maybe I can catch him at practice. But he has a game coming up soon... Are you saying I would bug him? No, I didn't mean that. Well, you may be right. Okay. In that case... I appoint you to take his place. I've always wanted to try this. It's so yummy! Aren't you eating? I'll eat it, then. How cute! Hello. Hello. -You like the piano? -Yes! I see. See that guy over there? He's a super good pianist. Play for them! Don't tell me... you'd shatter a child's dreams? Wow! Sorry. Hey! Friend A! You... Huh? Hurry up! Hey, where are we going? Hurry! We made it! How beautiful. I love watching the sunset from here. You don't play piano anymore? So you do know about me. You won the Moriwaki Student Competition. And the Urie International Competition, two years in a row. The youngest Saiki Competition winner, et cetera, et cetera. You were known for your meticulous precision. A human metronome. A prodigy who played Mozart with an orchestra at the age of eight. You know me well. Everyone in our generation knows you. You were our hero. Why did you quit? I can't hear myself play. But you were just playing. I can hear, at first. But then, it disappears. The more I concentrate, the more I get into it, the sound disappears. It must be my punishment. So I can't play. Play even if you can't play. What? If your hands don't move, use your feet. If you run out of fingers, use your nose. Mozart? Okay. Be my accompanist. I advanced to the next round as the "Audience Favorite." Were you listening? -I said I can't hear... -Give it a rest! I've decided. Friend A, I appoint you to be my accompanist. Kosei? Your accompanist? I want him to accompany me. What do you think? I think it's great! But I don't know if I can convince him. I'll help you! I'm so excited! Hey... This song is endless. What is this? Rondo... Capriccioso. Open your books to page 24. We covered the present perfect tense last class. We're going to force Kosei to play again. Were we too aggressive? Kosei needs that. To be honest, I don't care if Kosei plays piano again or not. But if he's going to quit, I want him to be okay with it. He's neither here nor there. It's hard to watch him. You like him, don't you? It's not quite like that. To me, he's always been like a helpless little brother. You know Kosei... Right after his pianist mother died, he was in a piano competition... but he suddenly stopped playing midway. He hasn't played since. Time stopped for him. I just want to wind his clock back and get it running again. Next stop, Totsuhara University Hospital. GETTING OFF "You must play!!!" You're still lagging! Play it correctly! Play it exactly like the music says! Everything is on the sheet! I can't play after all. Sorry. Kosei. What about Kaori's accompaniment? Find someone else. 23RD ANNUAL TOWA MUSIC COMPETITION SECOND ROUND There you are! So you've been hiding here. Why are you here? I'm looking for my accompanist, what else?! I said I can't play. You can play. You just won't. You say you can't hear the music, but isn't it just an excuse to run away? I'm scared. I'll be there. I'll be with you. I know you can't hear the music and you haven't played in a while. But I still want you. Our performance may not be perfect, but as long as I can play and people will listen, I'll play my heart out. I want my music to stay in their hearts. I want it to reach them. I can do that with you. I truly believe that. So, please. Accompany me. Give me a little support. When I feel like giving up, lift me up. Don't expect miracles. Hurry up! Come on! We'll be late, hurry! -We borrowed bikes. -Let's go! Thanks! Get on, Kosei. We'll get you there on time! Hang on, Kosei. So fast! Will you be all right? Did you even get to practice? No problem. We'll wing it. Watari was right. Whether you can or can't is for the girl to decide. You were seriously good! Really? I'm so glad! Blow everyone away again! Of course! Hiroko! Where's Kosei? In the dressing room. So Kosei is really going to play... -Ouch! -Ow! You blockhead! What the... Give it back! There's no time. Lift your face and look at me. If you keep looking down, the bars on the page will imprison you. It'll be fine. You can do it. Mozart is saying from above, "Embark on a journey." Leave your shame at home. Let's make fools of ourselves. Together. Number 14, Kaori Miyazono. Please stand by. Okay! Let's go! You're... You're so free. No, I'm not. It's the music that's free. Give me a note. Isn't that Kosei Arima? Arima? An accompanist? It really is him. But why? Okay, that was a good start. Kosei is playing again. She's rather subdued today. That's more like it. I can hear the music. I can do this. Only Arima could keep up with the changes in her tempo. What's wrong, Arima? Preposterous. Is he off? No way... Why? So he won't disrupt her performance. So it won't affect the judges. But doesn't she need an accompanist? They'll keep judging as long as she keeps playing. This is unprecedented! Why? Again. She started over. Is that okay? No, the competition is over for her. Leave your shame at home. Let's make fools of ourselves. Together. It's the music that's free. Calm down. I've heard this piece a thousand times. The sheet music was everywhere. Even if I can't hear the music, it's somewhere inside me! Hey now, Friend A. Don't upstage the star player! Wow... They're out of control. Like they're boxing. But the audience is captivated. Kaori, you're the best! You did it, Kosei! Thank you... Kosei Arima. That's the first time... you called me by name. No one here... will ever forget us. Not ever. I won't forget it. Even if I die. Go, Tsubaki! You're really fired up. I can't let Kosei and Kao outshine us. Was their performance that amazing? It was. Super amazing! He's fired up, too. So is Arima playing again? I don't think so. Here I go! Hop, skip, jump! Skip, jump! How about a canele? It's yummy. Aren't you meeting Watari? Nope. Today I'm with you. Let's walk. About the competition I totally bombed... I'm really sorry about that. Tadaa! They're sponsoring a gala concert and I was invited to play. An encore performance! Usually only winners are invited, but I'm in such demand! How about that? It's great. I'll go hear you play. Don't you mean, "I'll play with you?" -No way. -Yes. -No. -I want to play with you again. I'll mess you up again. Are you serious? I gave up playing the piano. Can you forget that feeling? The feeling when we played together. The thunderous applause. The moment our music reached the audience. Can you honestly forget that? Everyone's scared to perform. You could totally fail or be rejected. But we still grit our teeth and get up there. An invisible force drives us to perform. That's how the most beautiful lie is born. It's human nature. We're only 17! Let's take a chance and jump in! Like this! Hey! I always wanted to do this! It feels great! She's right. How can I forget that? It feels great! That was scary! Thanks. It's so big on me. Umm... I made soup. Where's your piano? Wait! Don't! I said, don't... Sorry. A healthy performance starts with a healthy environment! First, we clean! Let's clear the air! I decided on my piece for the gala. Kreisler's "Love's Sorrow." There must be a better piece. Something more grand... I've decided. This is it! It's so hot! So you play. A long time ago. Kao! Kosei! Tsubaki! GALA CONCERT Again! They're hard at work again today. Let's go take a peek. Nah. Go! I'll call you when it's time. I said no. I mean, I don't want to disturb them. She's exhausting. Her feelings are obvious to everyone but herself. Mom! I won! Unacceptable! Saki! What's wrong with you? You made mistakes on bars 3 and 11. And you lost your tempo on bar 13. I told you to be accurate! I played for you... Are you listening? I was hoping you'd get better! I won for you! Forget it! I hope you die! My mom returned to the hospital... and that night... she died. I killed her. That's when... the music disappeared. Kosei is playing the piano! Kosei, that song... Shall we go for a walk? "Love's Sorrow"... It always reminds me of Mom. She loved that song the most. She played it ever since her college days. When you were born, it became your lullaby. Whenever she played it, you were always lulled to sleep. Do you think Mom would approve... if I played "Love's Sorrow?" Do I have the right to play it? If you're unsure, try. Play it, and see what your mom has to say. Can I go see the fish? Don't knock on the glass okay? I know! You worry too much about everything. You used to have fun playing the piano. Follow your heart again. Play impulsively and lose yourself in it. Something may change. Mom! Look! There's a really cute one. What if being unable to hear yourself play... is actually a gift? GALA CONCERT Hiroko says... not being able to hear myself play may be a gift. I wonder what that means. Are you listening? She's sleeping. I can't wait for the gala. I wish it was here already. You're so ready. I'll be the star! You can count on it! So support me, okay? No! You have to say, "No, I'm the star." I'm the accompanist. No, no. A gala concert is all about showmanship. It's beautiful. Thanks. Twinkle, twinkle, little star. How I wonder what you are. Up above the world so high. Like a diamond in the sky. Twinkle, twinkle, little star. How I wonder what you are. Please. Can you make an exception? Sorry, but the last performer is always the winner of the competition. I won't indulge tardiness. I was opposed to inviting her in the first place. She disrespected music. She didn't disrespect music! She didn't show up. That says it all. She's coming. I'm sure of it. Please wait a little longer. I'm not changing the order. Period. Next is Kaori Miyazono. She made it! She had me worried. Is Kaori Miyazono here? Yes. Please stand by then. But she isn't... Today's main event is Kaori Miyazono. I'll have to stand in for her. But what are you going to play? It's a gala concert. It's all about showmanship. A solo by Arima at a violin gala concert? He's an accompanist. What is he doing? This isn't what they were practicing. Kreisler's "Love's Sorrow"... the Rachmaninoff transcription. I'll prove it to them. Today... we're the stars. Why is he playing so aggressively? What? Was I pounding the keys? No... "Love's Sorrow"... The "Love's Sorrow" Mom played was... Yes. More like this... It was my lullaby. Remember. Imagine. Kosei, more gently. Like stroking a baby's head and cradling him in your arms. What if being unable to hear yourself play... is actually a gift? The music... is in me. The doctor said no! I have to go to him and teach him the piano. Let me go. I don't have much time left. I have to teach him... to play... as a pianist so even after I've gone... he can go on living. So my precious son... can live a happy life. Saki, can you hear him? Our son... is saying, "Good-bye." It's Kosei. The Kosei that loved his mom. Right, Mom? Like cradling a baby in your arms. There's "Love's Joy" and "Love's Sorrow." Why do you always play "Love's Sorrow?" My mom is in me. Well, Kosei... So I'll be prepared for sorrow. We're connected. I know that. So... So, Mom... Goodbye. Kosei! Kosei. Hiroko. Do you think... it reached her? I played with all my heart. Do you think it reached her? Idiot! Of course it did. TOTSUHARA UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL I was all ready to go, and collapsed as soon as I left the house. The ambulance rushed me here. The ambulance was a bit much. I was anemic. I fainted and hit my head. They want to run some tests, so here I am. But you look fine. Yeah, I am. Sorry to worry you. Don't worry about that. Kosei did his best to fill in for you. He was seriously amazing! Really? I don't know much about music, but it was almost as moving as your violin. But I'm still the star, right? Of course. I'm going to buy a drink. I'll go, too. Kosei? The vending machine is this way. Sorry, I'm leaving. KAORI MIYAZONO Hello? Friend A! Why did you leave? Sorry. Something came up. Don't think you'll get off lightly. Just joking. I'll forgive you this time. You owe me some canele. And... tell me about your piano performance. The gala performance. All right? Okay. Fine. See you. What's going on? Why can't I move? Stand up... Stand up! You're my legs, aren't you?! Stand up! OCTOBER 4TH (TUESDAY) Miyazono is still in the hospital? She looks totally fine, though. Do the three of you go often? Kosei refuses to go, no matter what we say. Kao's waiting for him. Are you sure you want to encourage your rival? Rival? Why is Kao my rival? Kosei's the only one she can talk with about music. Stop being a martyr. Stop fighting it. You like him, right? No way! Definitely not! Stop it. You're so transparent. Just admit it. You're so honest today. But I'm not a martyr. When Kosei says he's not going, I feel relieved. I hate myself for that. I try to act cool and fool myself. That's not very cool, is it? I think all those feelings mean that you're in love. I don't get it! You always... appear out of nowhere. You were released. You traitor! Why didn't you come see me in the hospital? I was waiting for my canele. Sorry. Are you better? I'm officially back at school as of today. Where's Watari? Watari's still at school. I'll go get him. Wait. I'm giving the traitor a chance to redeem himself. I'm appointing you to be his replacement. Isn't this pretty? Yeah... it's pretty. Okay, this is it. That's cute, too! CHIKARA MOCHI SWEET SHOP This is amazing! Look! How amazing is this?! Cute doggie! So cute! Hurry up. Ready? Say, cheese. I'm going to get wet! Who cares? Today was... kind of like a date. Not that I've been on one. Are you playing the piano? A little. I... was so happy. When you told me that my violin performance at the preliminaries was good. So now it's your turn. You were born to express yourself. Kosei Arima. That's the second time... you called me by name. Let's get going. I forgot my bag! The school is kind of thrilling at night. I wonder if there are ghosts. Do you believe in ghosts? Or not? I can't believe you forgot your bag at school. You're right. What's wrong? Where's your bag? My bag... my bag. Where's my bag... By any chance... Sorry! I lied about my bag. But you were released and came back today, right-- --I lied about that, too. I haven't been released yet. I was given one day's leave from the hospital. I wanted to do things I couldn't do in a hospital. And... I really wanted to come to school. My illness... is kind of serious. Just kidding! Sorry. What's wrong with me? Let's go back. I can walk by myself. Let's go back. I swear, I'm fine! Miyazono! Miyazono! Miyazono! I'm sorry. It's not your fault. I'm sorry my daughter imposed on you. Kosei, Kaori said she wants to see you. I must have scared you. It's okay. I'm so selfish. I'm always causing you trouble. -That's not-- --I wish... I wish... we never met. Why won't you go see her? You owe Kaori so much. That's so cold. Look at me! Kosei... I... couldn't say anything. I... just ran away. So... How can I face her? Still. You should still go see Kaori. She was selfish. She relied on you. Whenever she wanted something, it was always you. But... I don't know what to say. You'll know when you see her. I can't. Whether you can or can't... is for the girl to decide. Kosei! Here. Thanks. You're so lame. Hot! It's just you. No, this is seriously hot! Kosei... You love Kao, don't you? Yeah. You're such an idiot. Kao loves Watari. I know. You're really stupid. Kao loves Watari. She would never fall for you. You must be stupid. Kao loves Watari. So... You have to fall in love with me. Huh? You don't even have the guts to go see her. You'll regret it, you creep! I... Who wants a chicken like you? Stupid idiot! I burned my tongue. How stupid... Practice again? We have a game soon so no breaks for us. Watari? I... really like Miyazono. I know, you idiot. Come in. Hi. Why? I promised you. Let's eat canele. No. I want to eat them outside. I'll kill you if you say I'm heavy. They're delicious. I'm entering the Eastern Japan Piano Competition. I don't know how far I'll get, but I'm moving forward. I want to perform with you again. I... like you. I know you like... Watari. But... I still want to perform with you. So... Will you perform with me again? You're the one who said, "Can you honestly forget that?" I can't forget. Our performance. Your violin playing. You're so cruel. Let's go back. Are you okay? I'm scared... I'm so scared... I'm so scared I don't know what to do. I don't want to die. No... No... I don't want to die! Don't leave me alone. I respect your resolve. But as I said before, this surgery is very risky. Yes, I understand. But I still want to do it. If there's even a sliver of hope, I'll take it. I'm desperate to live. I have... an important promise to fulfill. THE 48TH EASTERN JAPAN PIANO COMPETITION FINALS You'll be fine. Kosei? You look scary. Are you okay? Let's play! We're pianists, right? Express exactly what you're feeling right now. Forceps. Ring forceps. I can hear the music inside me. I'm here because I met you. We met. You shocked me... and made me laugh. You moved me. Now the music... is flowing out of me. Will my music... reach you? I hope it will. This is a love letter from Kosei to Kaori. The words we exchanged. A bit of regret. Singing, "Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star." These unforgettable memories sustain me. And inspire me. And drive me. And make me play. I'm playing for you. Now it's my turn to say, I'm here. I won't leave you alone. I'll never leave you alone. May it reach you... May it reach you with everything I have! TO KOSEI ARIMA FROM KAORI MIYAZONO Dear Kosei Arima, It feels weird writing to someone I just saw. I first saw you perform when I was five, at the recital of my piano school. That awkward boy hit his bottom on the piano seat and made us laugh. He sat in front of that huge piano. The moment he began playing, he became my hero. I wanted to perform with you one day. That's why I took up the violin. But you... had quit playing the piano! You were a real jerk the way you tossed me about. You oblivious, awkward dingbat! I was so excited when we enrolled in the same school. I was always wondering how I could start a conversation with you. But all I could do was watch from afar. You were such a close-knit group. There was no room for me. I had surgery when I was small. Ever since I collapsed in middle school, I've been in and out of the hospital. I spent long days in the hospital. One night, in the waiting room, I saw my mom and dad crying. I found out I didn't have long to live. That's when... I started to run. I did everything I wanted, so I'd have no regrets in heaven. I tried contact lenses. I changed my hair. I played the way I wanted to, rebelling against the music. But I lied. Just once. I said that Kaori Miyazono... had a crush on Ryota Watari. Why? But that lie... brought you... into my life. Apologize to Watari for me. And... apologize to Tsubaki, too. Since I'm just passing through your lives, I didn't want to leave any bad feelings, so I couldn't ask Tsubaki to introduce me to you. Because Tsubaki is in love with you. My lie brought you to me, but you weren't what I expected. You were dark, and sullen, and stubborn, and perverted. Your voice was lower than I thought. You were more gallant, and just as kind as I imagined you'd be. We jumped off Dokyo Bridge. The river was freezing and felt great. The crunch of the sand beneath our feet on the beach. The school at night. That was scary! All these little memories are the things I can't forget. Isn't that funny? How about you? Did I find a place in your heart? You stepped all over it. Will you remember me? Even just a little bit? You'd haunt me if I didn't. I don't want to do it over. No way. Don't forget me. Promise me. Will this reach you? I hope it will. Kosei Arima... I love you. Sorry for being so selfish. Sorry for so many things. Thank you. Kaori Miyazono. You're on a break, right? Come in. This really is the best place... The breeze is great here! Are you eating? Yeah. About half of what you eat. What the heck? You make me sound like a pig! Right? Don't think you're alone. I'll be one of those ghosts who follow you around everywhere. So you're not alone, Kosei. I'm burning up! It's still only spring break and it's scorching hot. Ow! Him, too. What was that for? Are you eating? You guys think alike. Kosei Arima. What color is your world right now? My life... was full of color, because of you.
