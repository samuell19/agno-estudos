(ROCK MUSIC) (PIANO MUSIC) LESLIE: Good job. How was your day, Meg? Fine, no meat. Hey dad can you look at my essays for Oberlin or Wesleyan later? Sure, but what about Chicago and Smith? Why Smith? It's all girls. LESLIE: Very funny. Think about it. BEN: Okay, You didn't put any? LESLIE: Nope, no butter. Great, TV makes you look a lot heavier and I can't afford that. LESLIE: I went to hear Celeste play some new music the other night. You know I appreciate you going and supporting your friends, but I really don't like you going downtown to these music clubs late at night. LESLIE: Would you like to guess who they sounded like? MEGAN: Mom, I'd love to, but I have a game tomorrow. Do you have any idea where my red running shorts are? They're on the dryer. And there's an apple pie on the counter. “Yes” they sounded like “Yes”. Hi, I'm Ben Miller, and I'm looking forward to getting to know each and every one of you. So glad I was able to make it. So glad you came. Thank you! It's a pleasure to meet you. Thank you, thank you. I don't believe it. Believe it piano princess, it's been way too long. Congratulations Darcy! Seems like you got half the city in your back pocket. I certainly hope so, no complaints. Any chance you'd switch parties before the May Primary? The Democrats would love to have you, I can vouch for it. Probably cause they won't have a shot in hell November once I'm nominated. Think about it, Darcy. Can I borrow you for a moment? Sure, excuse us. (CROWD CHEERS) I want to thank you all for coming here this evening. Let me make it official. On Monday morning, I'm going to announce my candidacy for the US Congress. (CROWD CHEERS AND WHISTLES) (PHONE RINGING) Hello? What? WOMAN: Do you know anybody here? No (WHISPERING) Oh my God, Rose. Open it later, honey. (ROCK MUSIC) This song is one of Celeste's best. It always sounded better back then. No kidding. Are you writing at all? No, I went to see her play a couple times last year. She seemed really glad to see me. You didn't call me? I'm sorry. I didn't tell anyone. Yeah, well. Who'd she play with? A couple a guys. Really good music. Hers. Could of used a piano. I'm not touching that one. What did Celeste's mama give you? I don't know. Open it. (CELL PHONE BUZZING) (LIGHT LAUGHTER) And I look at you I still see a college kid with a keyboard. Teaching the little ones doing it for you or are you still dreaming? Who plays music at our age? Yeah, really. DARCY: Musicians as good as you were could. No one inspired me to manage acts more than you. Speaking of music, I tried to reach Celeste, she never got back to me. Celeste died two weeks ago. God damn it. You got to be kidding. She played for me a few times at my club. I, I just spoke to her. LESLIE: She left me a letter. DARCY: Was it ugly? More on you bailing on signing the record contract with Artemis? LESLIE: No, it wasn't about that Darcy. DARCY: Well, what did it say? She wanted her new stuff played. You and Ellen could play it. A hail and farewell kind of thing. I do an open mic night at my club on Mondays. It'd be great. One shot to start and who knows where it could take you next. What have you got to lose? I owe it to her. One shot. You're out of your mind. You're crazy. BEN: Hmm? LESLIE: What do you think about Darcy? Same old Darcy, she never changes. No, I mean about Ellen and me playing a gig at the Oyster. Geez, I'm really nervous. It's crazy, right? What do you think? I don't know honey. I mean what makes you think you and Ellen can perform together at this point? Not that you're not talented and beautiful and I love you but I got to run. Wish me luck! Break a leg! JESSE: What are you doing? Jesse my eyebrows are disappearing. Okay, remember, noon viewers, women, male stay at homes, and the competition. The big boys who watch it online are on replay tonight. Okay? Great, I feel fat. JESSE: You look great! Right answer. Nadine, I couldn't have done this without you. Ben, you've got Nadine swooning. Don't be jealous Jessie. Five minutes. What? I can't smoke? Absolutely not. It's disgusting. Go outside. Don't forget to smile. I'm Ben Miller, I smile all the time. Here, let me fix your tie. Please. Your coat's all wonky. There you go. Here you go. We're a team. Go get em professor! Thank you. (PIANO MUSIC) That's pretty good Sadie. Let's take a break, alright? Can I watch too? Sure. BEN: I appreciate all the local support I've been getting especially from my loving wife and daughter. (PHONE BUZZES) And I'm confident that I can help bring this fine state back on track economically. Hello? DARCY: Hi Les. I'm rushing. Just wanted to let you know the next open mic night is Monday, Oyster Club, 7:30 p.m. I'm sure Ellen will be in if you are. Ben's announcing. DARCY: I know. Are you in? Please? Uh… DARCY: Talk to Ellen! Something simple, okay? Get there by seven. I'm excited. Gotta run. CELESTE: These are the early days. This is for you Leslie and Ellen, whenever and forever. Sometimes late at night, you are still my inspiration. (ROCK MUSIC) I'm too fat to go on stage. Are you listening to me? Trying not to. We would come home from a gig and we would be in heaven. We'd put our gear away. We'd all stripped naked and jump in the pool at three o'clock in the morning. There's nothing else like it, right? Les, we're old! We're fifty! You want to play seedy dives for a bunch of drunks who don't give a shit about what we're playing? Is that your dream? They all won't be like that gig in New Orleans. This is our time. For what? Humiliation? Do me a favor? Listen to this. She included me in the dedication? Yeah, she included you. So, what do you think? Will you do the gig? At least the Oyster date? It's not that simple, Les. I'm not going to go on stage because you're having an epiphany. I work hard. I like making a lot of money. I'm not trying to force you into anything. I know, look. We've hardly seen each other in the last few years. And suddenly you're facing mortality or regret and you want a shot at becoming the rock star you never became. You're interested too otherwise you wouldn't be here right now. Yeah, so? So? Who'd be our drummer? You know no one could ever replace Celeste. And who would be on bass? I'm sure Darcy knows some freelance bass players. I'll think about it. I promise. (BLUES ROCK MUSIC) Sorry. How late am I? Very. BARTENDER: Drink? LESLIE: Uh, uh. Richie come over here. This is Leslie. Hey. Do we know each other? Celeste's funeral, want a drink? Oh, not during the day, thanks. You knew her? She played here. I really liked her. Me too. Alright, Chardonnay please. Chardonnay? Alright, make it a Johnny Walker on the rocks. Tell you what, you gonna play tonight? Forget the Chardonnay. Forget the Johnny Walker on the rocks. I'll make you a bourbon and ginger with an olive, sound familiar? ELLEN: Love the salt! I can't believe I'm doing this. And your olive. Here's to Celeste and her Olives May she drum her way through heaven. ELLEN: We'd better get downstairs. RICHIE: Have a good show!

You'll need drums and bass if you're going ahead. If? Don't jerk us around, Darcy! I forgot how relentless you are. Okay, I'll find the musicians you keep practicing, a lot! (UPBEAT PIANO MUSIC) Ben? Yeah? Was I a good musician? BEN: You ARE a good musician. Remember that restaurant in Paris the summer after the band broke up? I played piano and you tried to sing to the house and we all laughed so hard cause you couldn't carry a tune. (LAUGHS) Well, that hasn't changed. We were so drunk. (LAUGHS) Yeah, and then we made love in the car. I cried and I told you how much I was going to miss the band. I know and then you forgot all about it. I didn't forget about it. Honey, listen, I was hoping that you would take a break from teaching the kids and work on my campaign. I don't know what you're talking about. I've got kids working towards college. I can't just quit. I know, I know. But I was just hoping that maybe you'd prioritize. Well, I'm too tired to prioritize right now.

WOMAN: If I was by myself, I would eat the whole thing. WOMAN: You don't have an eating disorder do you? I liked your imagination better before you went to therapy. I didn't go to therapy, we went briefly for couples counseling. Leslie do you think I should take up the piano for my anxiety issues? Yeah, I could teach you some punk rock music.

I like to capture color in motion. Tilt your head up. Did you say biology professor? Yeah, it's a long boring story. You'd rather just paint pictures when nobody's looking. You got it.

But please understand, I'm doing this for me. I had sex last night. You want to talk about it? Can you move toward the middle sweetie? Honey, can you move over a little?

He's putting a lot of pressure on me. So am I. ELLEN: Ben's a big boy, he'll deal. You haven't been living in my house lately. Megan's not too happy these days either. I got to go. Wait, wait a minute! Wait. Ellen, I got to go. Oh, please talk to me. What is there to say? It's just, could it be that after all this time, you're just getting cold feet? Could it be that my home life is none of your business? But you don't understand that because you don't, Oh, say it. Say it! No. Cause I don't have any kids, right? Stop it. This is a business proposition, one I invested in. Oh, you're not gonna make much money on us Darcy, because Leslie's got family obligations, remember? CINDY: Ellen. (GIRLS GROAN) Oh shit, she was gonna give me a ride home! DARCY: Les call me tomorrow and let me know what you want to do. I'm getting fed up! You know, you are so lucky here. You are doing exactly what you want to do with no guilt whatsoever. Are you kidding? Guilt is why I'm hiding behind this damn bar. Yeah. I feel like hiding too. Come home with me. I can't. Just one night. I'm a lot older than you. Not a lot. You're beautiful. I got to go. Les, I'm so glad you're here with me. Ben, I wouldn't be anywhere else. Aww, that's so sweet.

Ben, come with me, I'll get you another drink. Sounds good. Gorgeous man, keep an eye on him in Washington, if you know what I mean. Joey, Ben Miller, next congressman from Indiana. Pleasure. Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Miller. You like shaking hands, kissing babies? Only if they're cute. (BOTH MEN LAUGH) Babies or bartenders? (BOTH MEN LAUGH) I hate fucking babies. So tell me what do you need? Money. Whoa, jeez. Oh shit. No, no, no. That's okay. Okay, I'll take care of it, no worries. No, it's all right. Mr. Miller, I just want to say how much I admire you. Thank you Letting your wife become a star at her age. It's pretty cool. Huh? Have you seen her new YouTube video? It's my favorite. She'll for sure get you the youth vote! Les. Les. Les! Listen to me! I cannot have a MILF rocker wife. You're fucking up my campaign! How am I doing that? You are a role model, okay? I'm a Republican. I'm in the freaking Republican party. I get it, alright! You're a Republican! But isn't that why you married me? For the wild side of me? Les, that was 25 years ago! I can't have you playing at cheap seedy bars! Grow up, it's unseemly! Now you're going to treat me like a child? You know what's going on here? You're jealous. You're jealous because right now I'm more famous than Ben Miller! Les, give me a break. I hope those are comfortable walking shoes because that's how you're getting home. Fine! (KNOCKING) CELESTE: Les, you gave up once before. I'm giving you another shot.

You tube get ready for us one more time! Who wants a drink? I do. Leslie? What, did you hate it? I quit. I'm done. I'll find another piano player for you. I've thought a lot about this. What are you talking about? You just gave a great audition in there, are you nuts? Yeah, yeah I am. I'm nuts! I want this more than anything in the whole world. You understand that? All I know is that we finally have a shot and once again you're gonna fuck it up! Unlike you who came back to this band kicking and screaming, remember that part? So what? What's your point? Once I committed, I committed. I have worked my ass off for everything I have in a way you could never dreamed of, Princess. Oh, just like old times. Why are you so jealous? Jealous? My jealousy is your fantasy, Leslie. Go ahead, quit. We'll replace you. Go serve tea for twelve in Washington, wear Chanel, and wish you were here! You and Celeste never got me. Shit man, you two are a piece of work! Grow up and decide what you want. You are so bitter, Ellen. You quit the band and you went off to make a shit load of money just like you always wanted. Because I was poor and scared and you were just scared! Stop fighting. That's why you bailed on Celeste and me and the contract. Give us a chance. My husband and my kid need me! I got to go. Me too! I didn't sign up for this fucking group therapy. Show up for rehearsal tomorrow or peace out! Come on Jane. Are you just gonna let them go? Not a problem. You get to be all messed up and break everyone's heart, again. Maybe you and lover boy can figure it all out. I'm sorry, I didn't have anywhere else to go. I have some time before work, it's okay. What's wrong? One minute. I quit the band today. What? (CHUCKLES) Grace called today. My ex? Freaking out, crying, begging, And now you're losing your damn mind! How many more chances you gonna get Leslie, huh? You're over fifty, not going to be many more beginnings. Fuck you too then. I'm sorry. I'm just, I'm just upset. Look We're both a mess. Let me make you feel good. You mean yourself. Let's just get in the car and drive somewhere beautiful and I'll paint you in the moonlight. Screw the rest! I got to go. Drop the line, okay? It's great for when I'm in a jam. What jam? Grow up Richie. DARCY: Your music, for posterity. Thanks. Why aren't you at the Oyster where you belong? I'm helping my husband get elected. I'm done with the band Darcy. That's it. You always knew I had bigger aspirations. I've got to get home. See you later. Les?
