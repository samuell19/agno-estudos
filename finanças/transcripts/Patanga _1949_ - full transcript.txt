You Tube - Video Running Time 02:29:17 You Tube search name - Patanga Oh Almighty, I have turned old praying to You... but, you don't seem to answer my prayers. I have always asked You for a son... and You always disappoint me. After 6 girls, please grant me one son, oh God! A son to support me in old age. - Chaudhary... - What news have you brought? - Your wife has... - Delivered a baby girl again? No Chaudhary, a boy is born to your wife! A boy! Oh God, you are benevolent, you are merciful! Sohan, let there be celebration in the village from me today! Tell everyone that there will be a party in my house today. Alright. Oh, fair skinned one... Fair skinned one, the tresses spread across your fair skin They look like a kohl mark on a moonlit night Seeing the mirror she was stunned She was lost in the waves of her dreams She felt shy seeing her own gait The moon appeared from the clouds when the tresses moved When this moon was seen, it put the stars to shame Fair skinned one, the tresses spread across your fair skin Congratulations Chaudhary on the birth of a son. Why don't you give me also a small token? - Who are you, brother? - I can read a person's fortune. - He's an astrologer. - Come in and read the baby's hand. Yes, come. He's an astrologer, please let him read the baby's hand. Neptune and Saturn, this is amazing, truly great! Chaudhary, one must have fate lines like this. There is no tension or trouble, only joy in his life. What more is he destined for? I've never seen such a fortunate hand before in my life. Gangu, did you hear that, a king is born in my family! Chaudhary, then why don't you name him Raja? That's a nice name! Chaudhary, your son will be very lucky. He'll have cars around him when he grows up. Did you hear that my dear, he'll have cars around him. Oh Lord, your mercies are infinite! Well said, Mr. Astrologer. I'll have cars all around me. The material pleasures are dear to this world But for me, my beloved is the most dear Oh my beloved, accept my salutations You are very dear and one among thousands You're the beat of my heart, the light of my eyes My heart skips a beat. I stop in my tracks... if someone calls out your name I worship you. I don't care if the world does not I can sacrifice several lives in your name Seeing you, my heart blooms with joy I don't care about the world What a great voice. It has taken my breath away! Thank you very much. Now let me tell you the secret of my voice. The name of this tiny bottle is 'gala-khol dawai' (throat clear). After using this, no matter how bad your voice may be... it starts chiming like a bell. - What's the price? - Sir, good things are priceless. For the rich, it is 100 rupees and for the poor it's for 1 rupee. And if we are wrong, you can take back your money next Sunday. - Right, Baba? - Absolutely correct. - Whoever needs this, please come forward. - Step forward and buy it. You all have bought this throat clearing medicine? You work in a theater or a film company? Such frauds! They talk of a medicine which will clear the voice. - What are you thinking, Raja? - Rani, who said I am Raja? - The same way as you. - So, your name is Rani? And I am Raja, Oh Almighty, you are too good! God has made a pair, an orphan and a damsel! Get lost from here! Won't you buy the medicine? Well Rani, the thing is that my voice is naturally sweet. My throat is so clear that an entire motor can pass through. When I sing, the windows open, the bells start chiming. - Okay, as you wish. - Hey, Rani... What a lovely name she has! Because of your carelessness, the cars banged into each other. You are suspended from this job for one year. Sir, don't make a hasty decision. Your decision can change my life. I'm the sole bread earner of my family. My parents are very old... and I have 6 sisters, who are of no use. And if you do this, I too will become worthless. I won't change my decision. You may rejoin after a year. As you wish, sir. I shall return on 15th December, next year. My dear half a dozen sisters, I am extremely sorry to say... that your precious and only one brother, is now jobless. So now, how will we survive? I, too, am worried about that. But, what's the point? The one who has given us this life, will give us food, too I mean God has brought us on this earth, he'll give us food too. So why don't we put our worries into His hands? Mother, my dear mother, you please don't worry. As long as your son Raja is alive, you won't have to face problems. I have decided that, to earn a living, I shall fight my fate. I shall struggle in life. Had you been worthy of doing this then why would I worry? You're worthless. If I find that astrologer, I'll make mincemeat of him! The rascal said there will be cars all around you. If the cars aren't around me then one day they'll be over my head. Bless me, Mother. I am going now. Even I am a gentleman but, my pockets are empty. Indian food is made in pure butter. Rates are moderate. Now, that's the wrong way to put it. Hey, why are you throwing me out? Get lost, you rogue! Please give me a hand, brother. Did you hurt yourself? The staff here is really very rude. - They take money and throw you out? - Who paid them the money? Oh! So you are also like me. Come, embrace me! I am pleased to meet you. Well actually, even I am hungry. Don't worry and go inside. After eating get thrown out like me. But tell me, do they throw you very hard or softly? Don't worry. The waiters are quite weak. I come here every day. That's nice. I'll see you later. Now wait and watch the fun, my dear friend. Excuse me, but when the table is shared, the appetite grows. - That's why I sat down here. - Never mind. - I'm also a customer like you. - No, I'm not a customer. - I know you very well. - You know me well? - Come here and take my order. - Coming, sir. Looks like there's no decent waiter in this hotel. - What's there to eat here? - Have a look at this, sir. - I've forgot my glasses. You read it. - Alright then. Mutton, potatoes, spinach and pumpkin. Pumpkin isn't worth eating here. Everyone eats it at home - Read more. - Okay, sweet potatoes, brinjals... - and fried lentils. - What's this fried lentils supposed to be? Sir, I meant seasoned lentils. The English have left India but have left their frying pans behind. Okay go, get two plates of everything. - Two plates? - Yes, I have money. Bring three plates! - Don't look at me. - Alright, sir. - This is your change. - Keep the rest as a tip. - It's okay. - Salaam. - Thank you very much. - What for? For your mercies. Bring it. I ordered for three plates and you got only two? - Sir, they are three plates. - Really? Okay, go. Get me some salad. The bread is too dry. Thank you God for granting me such a sumptuous lunch. - Sir, this is your bill. - How much? - 7 rupees 25 paise. Is that all? Stand straight. Attention! I'll give you the money. Oh God! I've been robbed! Now these guys will throw me out! Why sir, now you are in trouble? Alright, I'll take your leave. Oh, so you have outsmarted me? Can you give me credit today? - Gope Waiter. - It's not waiter. It's a theater. - Theater? - Yes. Go ahead. - Here? Rani, his stick is too big. I'm scared. - You find some other way. - I'll divert his attention. - You sneak in. - I'll do that. But, you be careful. For whom are you looking? I was looking for you all over the city. I got your address with great difficulty. You were looking for me? Tell me my dear, what's the matter? My father has fixed my wedding with a very old man. I've run away from home. Can you get me married to someone else? Get you married? So you're looking for a strong, young man? Look at God's mercies. I didn't have to work hard. - Listen. - Tell me your choice. - I want someone with big eyes... big mustache and a broad chest. Dear, you'll not find a strong, young man like me anywhere. I agree. Why are you looking there? - Look into my eyes. - Forget eyes. You're in my heart, too. Let me tell you something. You have a very sweet voice. I feel like shutting my eyes and holding your image in my heart. Then who's stopping you? You shut your eyes. - I'll keep talking. - Is that all? My dear, if you say, I can stop my heart from beating, too! - Look, I've shut my eyes. - I'll never forget your favor. Oh God. Yes my dear, tell me more. Shall I tell you something? I feel like embracing you. Liar! She's cheated me and ran off? I feel so helpless, my beloved is away. - Raja, what's written here? - Move aside. O F I C S, office. Popat, no, proprietor, Nathuram Gope. Producer Nathuram Gope. Writer Nathram Gope. - Director Nathuram Gope. - Gope, Gope, Gope. Gope, the hairdresser, the dress designer, all in one! You've got us in a useless company. Let's go back. Relax, you don't know. Film and theater companies are like this. This is a famous company and the owner, Gope, is a miser. He's fat but very stingy. Miss Jalwa, ready for rehearsals? Try to bring love in your eyes. You mean passion? If you don't come into my life... I wonder where I'd be? Your love has given me new life. Say it with passion, Miss Jalwa. Also, try to concentrate on acting. You're an assistant and teaching me to act? I've worked with big actors. I've worked with Mr. Gope. You've insulted me. I'll complain to Mr. Gope about you. - Mr. Gope! - Miss Jalwa, what happened? - Why are you crying? - Your assistant says I can't act. What, he says you can't act? - Where is that idiot? - Yes sir. You are not a man. You're an idiot. - I work for one. - Very good. - Sir, he called you an idiot! - What? You called me an idiot? - Yes sir. - You call me an idiot? - No sir, I'm an idiot. You think by applying scented oil, you can become an assistant. Get out! Didn't you hear me? Get out! Would you like to rehearse? - Had you not come into my life... - Had you not come into my life... That's great! Now Miss Jalwa, put your hand on your chest. Bring out love in your eyes and look at me. Now move your right leg 2 feet 6 inches, forward... and your left, one and half feet behind. - What great direction that is. - Who are you? I swear, I've never seen such a great director. You have outsmarted everyone in your profession. Your direction is to the mark of perfection. Thank you, the stage direction is such but, who are you? - I am Raja. - Raja? From where, which state? - A poverty stricken state. - A poverty stricken state? - Where is it? - In the Himalayas. You've not seen it. - Okay. What's your name? - Gulamchand. Strange name, strange state! People do have strange names. So do I. - What do you want? - I've brought a precious gem from Madras. Her name is Miss Rani. There's magic in her voice. Her style is enchanting. - She dances like lightning. - I don't need any lightning. We already have one. Forget it, you can't run your theater with this madam. She speaks Hindi with an English accent. - You're insulting my heroine. - Sorry, I am not doing that. I am just insulting her accent. As long as you speak like her she'll never improve. Assistant! Don't watch my face. Get them out of here! Don't worry, we'll go ourselves. Rani, let's go. They don't value Indian tradition. Let's go. Miss Jalwa, don't mind his words. He seemed to be a crazy man. Come, let's rehearse. Forget it Raja. You said we'd get a job on reaching here. But we didn't get anything. You only talk big. Silly girl! You still don't know what I am? You think I have only one solution to our problem? I have several solutions to one problem. You come with me and see what I do now. Come on I say. Brother, do you work here as a hero or a villain? Do you work as a heroine or a vamp? - Who are you both? - We are... Raja, how do I look? Don't look into the mirror, for my heart skips a beat My heart burns with desire when you smile at me Stop it! You're teasing me. Don't kill me with your looks, oh my dear The bell is ringing, Rani. Let's go quickly. - Hello, Mr. Gope. - Hello. Hey, you! - Where are you going? - Brothers, we want to sing... but this fatso, bird brain isn't letting us sing. Actually, these people don't work in our company. Our hero and heroine are ready. These people are impostors. Hit them! Throw one more, on my behalf! Enough! Stop it now. - Come on, sir. - Leave me! The one who came into this world and didn't fall in love... he may have lived a long life, but was that life worth living? Oh, my dear people, it is nice to fall in love Only sometimes It is nice to have someone reside in your heart Only sometimes If there was no love in this world, would life be worth living? Nobody would sigh in peace. Nobody would cry in anguish Oh, the one who smiles in love, it is nice to shed tears Only sometimes If the flame does not burn, then who will appreciate a firefly? In the absence of a flame, why would a firefly burn himself out? It's nice to burn in desire for someone Only sometimes - You were simply superb, Mr. Gulamchand! - Gulamchand? Call me Raja, that was my film name. Why didn't you tell me before that Miss Rani sings so well? - She dances so well. - And I? You are too good! When you sing, you cast a magic spell. I want you both to join my company. - Join? - Forget about giving us jobs. First he throws us from his office and now he offers us a job! Fatso! Raja, let's go. We don't want to work here. We won't work? Miss Rani, I made a mistake. Please forgive me. - Forgive him. - Never. I will give you and your friend a salary of Rs. 400 per month. - Rs. 400/-? - If it's not enough then I'll give Rs. 500/-. - Rs.500! - What happened? - Get some water for him! Pandu, come here! - Mother, how do I look now? - You look like a king. - That astrologer was right. - If I find him, I'll kiss him. I'll embrace him and shower him with gifts. And if he agrees then I'll make him my theater's actor! - First you become an actor yourself. - Is anything left yet? With black eyes and red lips, I can kill people with my style! My dear sisters, your brother has got a job. You'll also be glad to hear that I've brought you a sister-in-law. - Really? - Have you chosen a girl for yourself? No mother, that girl has chosen me. We bumped into each other or, our fates bumped into each other. You can wait for your sister in law... and mother, you wait for your daughter-in-law. I'm too shy to say more. Mother, bless me, please. My blessings are with you. May God bless you wherever you go. - May God make you a big actor! - Oh my dear God... fulfill my mother's desires. I'm a mere mortal who has sinned... and you're the one who forgives. I'll keep doing wrong things... and you please keep forgiving me, but remember... don't forget our friendship. Okay then. Miss Thaiba, this is a theater. You can't feel shy here. You need to act freely here. - Miss Jalwa...- What's happening here? - I was thinking of a scene. Thinking of a scene or going around girls? I can think only when I do that. Get ready. The curtain will rise. - Come on, hurry up! - Fatso! She'll never improve! - Raja, Rani, are you ready? - Yes. Raja, aren't you ready yet? Mr. Gope, I am feeling very nervous today. It happens. When I went on the stage for the first time... I was around 6 feet tall. But now, working so hard, I've become 5 feet 3 inches. Sir, you have become short and fat too. You've also begun insulting me? Concentrate on your work, Rani. Don't call me fat. - Mr. Gope, may I say something. - Yes? - I hope you won't get upset? - Have you ever upset me? - You look like an orphan today. - Rubbish! My parents are alive! - You really look like an orphan. - Raja, I give you notice. - You can't talk like this! - You're upset, my fat man. - Don't talk like that. - Go now. The curtain will rise. You also get ready. Rani, only 5 minutes before the bell. Five minutes. He's fooling around with me! I'm the owner of this company! - Mr. Gope, hide quickly! - What happened? Why should I hide? Japan has asked our Prime Minister for an elephant. What's that to me? People are coming to catch you and send you to Japan. That's great! I will go to Japan and call you there... What? They're sending me to Japan? Am I that elephant? You're saying yes? Did Raja teach you this impertinence? She calls me an elephant! - Sir. - Stop it! Have you also brought some news from Japan? - Do they want a bear now? - No sir, Raja is not well. He says he may not be able to work today. He's not well. He was telling me the same. What will we do if he's not well? Okay, I will. Hey, listen. Tell Raja to take the day off and return here tomorrow at 9 A.M. - Today, I'll replace him. - Oh! Why are you standing here? Go I say! Is this Dehradun in India? Hello? I'm calling from Rangoon I would like to speak to my wife, Renuka Devi Yes My beloved has gone to Rangoon... and he calls me from there How your memory haunts me. How your blazing soul torments me How deeply I regret leaving India I made a mistake by not bringing you along I wander the Burmese streets alone, while you languish in Dehradun How your memory haunts me. How your blazing soul torments me I have lost my hunger and thirst, pining for you I have lost weight grieving for you Without you, my January and February seem like May and June How your memory haunts me. How your blazing soul torments me Being apart from you has made an ascetic of me I survive on mere crumbs of stale bread I tie a lungi around me. I no longer wear trousers How your memory haunts me. How your blazing soul torments me My beloved has gone to Rangoon and calls me from there How your memory haunts me. How your blazing soul torments me Mr. D'souza, I need some rooms for my staff. - We have only single rooms. - It's fine, nobody is double. - Right, Raja? - We aren't, but soon we'll be double. Till then they'll have two rooms. Write. 21 rooms with attached bathroom. - Shyam, look there, death! - Death? Whose death? Our death. Look there! My dear man, you claim to be a Casanova. Prove to me it's true by speaking to this beauty. Not like this, I'll talk to her only if you lay a bet. Alright, I challenge you for 10 rupees. Alright then. Excuse me, are you Miss Nigar Sultana? No, my name is Rani. But you look exactly like her. That's why I was mistaken. - May be, I don't care. - I am Professor Shatarmurgh. - Shatarmurgh? - Yes, I would like to show you a small trick. Look into my eyes. They change colors. - They change colors? - Yes, look here. They'll change colors. Look into my eyes. Hey! I just saw your eyes turning red. Thank you, this is nothing. I know many such tricks. If I get the time I'll show them to you. Good bye for now. Please don't go. Let me tell you, even I know one small trick. - Magic trick? - Yes, would you like to see it? Have you seen anyone grow crops on their palms? - No. - Watch carefully. You'll be able to see mustard grow here. Watch carefully, very carefully. Don't ever try to tease any girl again! That was a great mustard crop! That was good fun Shyam. Here's the bet money... and this is for your treatment. You may be taunting me now but remember... the hand which has slapped me, I'll be holding that same hand. Please sign. - Manager, who was that girl? - Why, do you have a problem? - What? - I mean, she is Miss Rani... heroine of Gope Theater and I am the hero. I'm the proprietor, Mr. Gope. Sir, she's great at her work. She casts a magic spell! - Many people have even fainted. - Okay, I'll see that tonight. - Thank you very much. - You are welcome. You'll never learn. Why ask people for cigarettes? Take this! You're a miser. You don't pay me. You smoke three packs every day and yet say that I'm a miser? Sir, my pen. - Who was that boy? - Son of a landlord. He's staying here. - Is he loaded with money? - Yes. The conduct in the world towards love is unique In the court of love, this heart is the master This is a strange place and strange laws apply here The complaint of love is filed with the lover The communication by the eyes is how love is transmitted In the school of love, there is only one class There are thousands of students, but only a few pass through It's a difficult subject, but very enjoyable The one who has fallen in love has been lost in love That person becomes incapable of doing anything else For that person, every day is a Sunday In the court of love, this heart is the master The conduct in the world towards love is unique In the court of love, this heart is the master Just a minute Rani. I have to photograph you. It's to be printed in the paper. Hey cameraman, wait there. Let me come, too. Please smile. - Wait, please. - 55 kgs. I didn't mean your body weight, Mr. Raja. I was saying I'll take your pictures later. After her? Hey, silly man! Learn to respect a man! Foolish! Please smile. Thank you. Miss Rani, you were great. I swear it, you have beaten the film actresses too! Don't talk so much. Who gave you permission to come here? - My heart. - So, you've forgotten yesterday's slap? How can I? lts sweet sound is still echoing in my ears. Hey! Who let you in? Mind your own business! I'd like to give you a diamond ring, Miss Rani. A diamond ring? You must have surely stolen it from somewhere. You want to give it to Rani and get us arrested? Don't doubt me, my dear man. I'm a landlord's son, not a thief. I've worked as a cop for three years. I can recognize a thief from a distance. If you wish to live longer, then go back home or... Raja, what's the matter? Nothing! He doesn't know us and wants to give Rani a ring. - Just look at his face. - He wants to give a ring? Oh! So it's you? Let me see that ring. - Here it is. - Yuck! You brought this ring for Miss Rani? What do you think she is? You'd give her a glass ring? Take this and throw it away! Strange man! I came to honor her and you're insulting me? - You don't know who I am! - I know men like you. There are many crazy lovers like you who hover around this place. Leave from here or it won't be good for you. Raja's punch is powerful. Even I've had the experience. - One, two... - Don't count three. I'm leaving. Not from here. That's the way. Good he left or I would have crushed his bones! Crushed his bones! Has anyone in your family ever killed a fly? - No, we've killed elephants like you. - In your dreams! - Shut up! - Rani, you remove your makeup. Now you go to the hotel. Rani, are you seeing how fame can change everything? When you sang on the streets, you never made more than pennies. And now, the sons of landlords... wear their hearts on their sleeves and present you diamond rings. But Raja, I'm still the same Rani who lived on the streets. The world may have forgotten who I am, but I haven't. A person does not change with fame. Silly girl, it's been only a short while. There may come a time when you might also forget. Alright, I'll go now. When God gives beauty, one develops attitude I will find you wherever you go - It's you? - Yes, your fan, your slave. You know it's a crime to come to someone's room without permission? I know it's a crime and I know I'll be punished for it. But I couldn't control my heart. It wouldn't listen to my mind. Let me call the police. They'll take care of your heart and mind. If you wish to see your lover in jail, then please go ahead. So, you think your sweet words can win me over? - Waiter! - Louder. - Shut up! - Waiter! - The waiter will come. And the police to arrest me. But remember, along with me, you, too, will be defamed. A man can endure being defamed... but the stigma of slander can't be wiped from a woman's head. Don't you bother. I'll call the waiter here. - Waiter? - What are you doing? - Waiter. - Please don't call out to him. - Waiter! - Please think of my reputation. I'll be defamed. I don't want to do that. Madam, let me relieve your burden. I'll call the waiter, you call the police. Please don't speak so loud. Someone may hear you. Perhaps you've changed your mind. Thank you. Please don't take advantage of my situation. If you are a decent man, then you'll leave. I'll go, but I have one small condition. What condition? You have to accept this ring. Why do you want to give me this ring? You're very simple. Do I have to spell it out? Don't you understand the language of my eyes? - I don't have to understand it. - Whether you understand or not... I'll speak of my feelings. Our first meeting was a joke. I didn't know the prank I was playing... would take the form of love one day. This is a lie. How can love happen at first sight? Why not? Haven't you ever seen Indian films? The hero and heroine bump into each other at a hotel, a cinema... a vegetable market, shop, plane or a car... and fall in love at first sight. After that, they both faint. - Really? - Yes. - But I have no love for you... and neither have I fainted. It is you, who keeps hovering around me. Every lover is crazy! Please accept this ring. If my love is true, then you'll also begin to love me. Take. Rani, whose voice can I hear from your room? Voice? Raja, I was rehearsing for tomorrow's drama. Oh! I thought that guy with the ring came here again. No, I was just trying to rehearse my lines. Good you reminded me. I, too, have to rehearse for tomorrow. But, I left my script in your room. - Please get it. - Okay. Rani, are you going to dance in the drama? You wait here, Raja, while I get your script. Return quickly. Raja, don't sit on that table. There's a huge bug in it. - A bug? - Yes, it bites real bad. It already bit my foot! You get the book. Maybe your blood's sweet. it won't bite me. Rani, there are mosquitoes in your room, too. Rani, they're attacking me! Bring my script quickly! The bug Rani spoke about, I felt it pricked me with a pin. Seems like an intelligent bug! Hey, you bug! How did I harm you? Rani, you were right. This table is infested with bugs. Raja, you are too obstinate. I stopped you from sitting on this table. So what? Hey! Rani, I think your table walks too! Raja, you've gone mad. How can a table walk? It's still there. Come on Raja, let's rehearse together. I'll sit on the floor because I don't trust your furniture. Alright, let's go. Ghost! Raja, ghost! What is it? Where are you? Shatarmurgh, you? You went to win over Rani's heart and came back as a table? I used such a ploy that Rani had to yield to my advances. She was about to give her heart to me when that Raja appeared. - And you came back as a table? - Forget about all this. Now think of a trick by which she comes to me on her own. There are many tricks, but one needs lots of money. Don't worry. For Rani, I can make money flow like water. - But who will open this tap? - My father, who else. Listen, do you have a vacant bungalow somewhere? Bungalow? Yes, the one in Rangpur is lying vacant. Then your job is done! Now listen to me. - What a great idea! - After all, I am your friend. I am just a few steps ahead of you! What do I do with my heart? It doesn't listen to my mind. Mischievous man. For how long will you remain silent? I know that you love me. The day will come when you tell me yourself... 'My Raja, I love you a lot.' Oh Lord, thanks for everything you have given! I'm fed up trying to satisfy your needs. I wonder where you spend all the money. I am not asking for more. It's only ten thousand rupees. So far I've spent my days like a pauper. I didn't go to Kashmir, nor did I have new clothes made. Mother, I have promised my friends and I'll give this party. - Yes son, you will. - Over my dead body! As long as I'm alive... I won't see my hard-earned money being wasted like this! - Did you get that? - You also tend to be too obstinate. Our son wants to do this. Please let him. He doesn't care. When I tell people my father is a landlord... everyone laughs at me, and why shouldn't they? I look like some insurance company agent. Shut up. Say nothing more! I don't have money to waste. Alright, if you won't give the money then I'll borrow it. Did you hear that? He thinks he's too big for his boots! He wants his freedom. We should get him married to Purnima now. Purnima has grown up and Shyam is far beyond grown up. At least with this marriage, Shyam's behavior will improve. Also, the promise I made to Purnima's deceased father... will be fulfilled. - What do you feel? - As you wish. Why does every father take revenge for what he was deprived... from his father, from his own son? My dear man, this is life and it will always be. Okay now, forget your anger and make arrangements for the money. Everyone knows that if there is no money, there is no love. But my father has refused and, you know, money doesn't grow on trees. That's right but, there's no way out until there's no money. Purnima? Coming. - Yes Purnima, what is it? - Here's a check for 10,000/-. A check for Rs. 10,000/-? How did you know I needed it? Don't ask that. I keep looking for excuses to serve you. No Purnima, I have no right to this. Your father left this money for your wedding. One day you'll have this money, so why refuse it now? I am happy that you want to give a party for your friends. You'll earn fame and honor and that will make me happy. - Please take it. - If you insist then how can I refuse? - Are you happy now? - Yes. - Okay, don't tell my father. - I won't. - Okay then. Oh God, thank you for hearing his prayers in time. But Shyam, who was this girl? My fiancée. She was orphaned when she was a kid. My father raised her. And leaving such a good girl, you're after that Rani? Aren't you ashamed? Shyam, don't play with fire. I hope you don't burn your fingers while playing. Oh, stop it! Don't give me sermons. Take this check and start spinning your tricks. Alright, it was my duty to explain. Now if you agree or not, up to you. Where are you off to? My love, I didn't know you were in this condition. My love, the way a fish writhes on a hook. Oh God! I have been making you rehearse since morning... but you're getting it all wrong! I understood now. I won't get it wrong this time. Miss Jalwa, you are great and so is that fat fan of yours! You can't work in theater. You go to the station... - and sell peppermint candies. - Mr. Gope! - He's talking rudely to me! - You can't even say that right! Go to your Mr. Gope. I wonder where he found her? I've got good news. Miss Jalwa, the news is terrific! Hey watermelon, why are you dancing like a bear? Raja, it's not nice that you call me names in front of women! - I don't like this! - Okay, now tell us the news? - Why are you jumping with joy? - I forgot to tell you. Look, the whole world is talking about our company. - A landlord has hired us. He'll give us Rs. 7,000/- for one show. - What? - I said seven thousand! - I've donated that much many a times. - You're great! Listen to me now, we have to reach there tomorrow. Get ready. - Should I wear a suit? - Go ahead. Look at you! You really look like your father now. Stop it! Tell me, will anyone recognize me? My friend, even if your father sees you, he won't know it's you. He'll wonder where did his younger brother come from? Talk with respect. I'm your father. - Father, forget it! You're a fake father. - What did you say? I'm scared of you. You might really start acting like my father! Now come on, go to the station. It's time for their arrival. - You are so restless. - Yes, I am. - Okay, I can do this for you. - Come on then. - Junior Master. - You recognized me? I was hiding and watching what you were doing. But sir, why do you have to get into disguise? A drama company is coming here. - Will there be a dance? - Will you also dance? - Yes! I won't dance, I've disguised myself to fool others. - So don't tell anybody. - Not even your father? Don't tell him at all! Take this, keep it. What's the need for this? Okay, I'll make clothes for Gudiya. - Alright. - Let's go, Gudiya. You know what? Your gardener's sister is really very pretty. She's not his sister, she is his wife. - Wife? Okay, let's go. - Yes. I wonder whose face I saw in the morning. I've got money! It's only five rupees. It's not a huge treasure. What if the senior master comes to know? - You'll lose your job. - I'll lose it? I am sure this drama company is an excuse. It's something else. So tell me what I should do? - Inform the senior master. - But this money? Keep it and inform the master quickly about everything. You are great, Gudiya. Excuse me, are you the owner of Gope Theater Company? It's me, not him! Hello, I am Randhir, the son of Rangpur's landlord. Sir, you're too much. We've been waiting an hour for you. Our heroine is here... - and our bags are there. - Sorry, Mr. Gope... I was delayed. Your horse carriage is ready. Have you made arrangements for an elephant? Why does one need an elephant when he is around? So, you've begun poking fun at me, too? Please come along. Please sit here. My father is resting upstairs. I'll go and get him. Father, Shaturmurgh, wake up, they're here. - They're here? - Father, those people from the theater are here. And your beloved Rani is also with them. Randhir, have they reached safely? Yes very safely. I have put them up in their rooms. - They're waiting for you. - I'll come down. Get my glasses and cigar. - Won't you smoke a pipe? - Get out of here! This is my father, Shri Mahayudh Maharao Mahasagar. Colonel Vir Pratap Singh Chaudhary Nakal Mar Singh. - Hello! - And father, this is Mr. Nathuram Gope. The owner of the company, actor, director, producer and writer. - I have to do everything myself. - Pleased to meet you. - Me too. - Raja. - I am the hero of this company. Before this I guided the way for the cars. I mean I was a traffic constable. Excuse me, look here. Now I'm your guest I swear it. I'm very pleased to meet you. Same here. Miss Rani. - Hello. - You must be the heroine of the company. I've heard a lot about you, I've heard Mumbai is crazy about you. You're very kind, but it's news to me. The diamond is not aware of its true worth. Miss Halwa. - My name is Miss Jalwa. - What's there in a name? It all means the same. This is Miss Rani's respected father. - Hello, sir. - I am very pleased to meet you, sir. Me too. I've troubled you all because, tomorrow is my son's birthday. Oh! So tomorrow your son is going to be born? No, he was born around 20 years back. - It's his twentieth birthday. - That's even better. Every year, on his birthday I call for a drama company. Sure, after all, he is your only son. Sir, by God's grace, I'm also the only son of my parents. - That's nice. - I swear, after 6 sisters, I was born. My father celebrated my birth so much that we became paupers. No problem. Raja, you seem to be a very interesting man. - Son, call the gardener here. - Okay, father. - Gardener! - Yes, sir? Where is your husband? - He's not well. - What happened to him? He's feeling dizzy. Remember you gave him those five rupees? Enough! I'll give him more. Ask him to rest. Take the guests to their rooms. Very good. - Alright. Please come. - Yes, please go. - We will see you later, good bye. - Good bye. Good bye, sir. - Father? - Yes son? - I'm very tired. - Please massage my feet. - Shameless, you want me to do it? You're a fake father. If you don't, I'll shout and tell. - What did you say? - You want to see? You won't listen unless I threaten. Press properly. - Press properly or I'll scream. - Alright! - Now this one, too. - Okay. - Excuse me, sir. - Please come, Mr. Gope. The rest of my staff is coming by tonight's train. Have you made arrangements to fetch them? It will be done. Son, press my feet properly. I said press properly. That's more like it God bless you. - You said we'd get an advance. - The money is ready. If you have no problem in giving then we have no problem taking it. You go and rest in your room. I'll have it sent. Alright. You have a very nice son. Mr. Gope you must have heard, like father, like son. Without advance notice, what brings you here from Rangpur? - I have come to give you news. - What news? - Your son is presenting a drama, sir. - Drama? - Yes. - What drama is it? - I don't know exactly. But I do understand that something is quite fishy there. A drama company has come to stay in the bungalow. Strange and colorful girls, strong, young men. And sir, junior master is wearing a beard. - Beard? - Yes, perhaps he is trying to deceive someone. Now I get it. That's why he was asking me for ten thousand. But, who gave him the money? - Yes, father? - I want to ask you something. - Ask me. - Will you tell me the truth? I have never lied to you. - Have you given money to Shyam? - Me? - Yes, you! - Why do you doubt me? - Nobody else besides you can help him. If you hide the truth, you'll be doing an injustice to yourself. - Did you give him the money? - Yes, he needed it. It was the matter of his honor. You know he is ruining my honor and your life with that money? No, he wouldn't do that! It's your duty towards him which speaks like this. Day by day, he is going from bad to worse. On the pretext of a party, he has called dancers home. He doesn't care about me or you. - Hello. - I said hello It always begins with a hello Then love begins with a smile It always begins with a hello The flowers of joy bloom when the eyes meet And then life changes completely While traveling on the road, you bump into each other Then love develops after frequent smiles This makes the world burn with anger There are many beautiful sights on the way Don't let your eyes wander all around Let us all walk on our own paths It all begins with a hello. Then it develops into love with a smile. - My fake father! - Okay son. That was very nice! Rani, I hate this landlord. When he looks at you, it feels as if he'll eat you alive! I've dealt with many such men. What do you think I am? I've become an actor only recently. Before this, I sang on the road for 5 years. I can understand what people mean and say. If once I look at someone, he'll fall in love with me immediately! Forget it! I've even seen English men in England. There, nobody even knows when someone is in love. The heart just goes weak in a second. - Have you ever fallen in love? - Forget about that, Jalwa. Listen Rani, if you're my true friend then tell me the truth. I did fall in love, Jalwa, but only for a brief moment. Someone came to me with love, but I spurned that person. And when he went away, my heart called out to him... - but, he didn't return. - He'll surely come one day. - I'm here. - What do you mean? I mean I've something to say. Miss Jalwa, will you please... - if you don't mind. - So I should go out now? I understand. Okay Rani, I'm going. - You can read that book to me later. - Okay. - Bye. - Bye bye. Sir, what work do you have with me? I have no work. It's my heart that wants to tell you something. - What do you mean? - Don't get angry. I've had no control over myself, since I saw you dancing in Mumbai. Since that day, besides thinking of you, I've done no work. My son's birthday was an excuse. I called you here to see you. Are you out of your mind? You're like my father. Aren't you ashamed to talk to me like this? A broken heart is begging for love at your doorstep. Don't spurn it. Give me the joy of love... and I'll give you the riches of the world. Leave or I'll shout and call everyone here. Don't scare me away! Worshipers of beauty don't fear defamation. - I don't care what people say. - Release my hand! - I won't - it won't be good for you! Who cares! I want to douse the fire which you've lit, my love! - Your love? - One more! - I want to pull out your beard! - Go ahead. What's stopping you? What a rascal! - Oh, it's you? - You didn't recognize me... but I would have recognized you in any form you would have come. And you know why. Because I truly love you. Shyam, are you playing a joke on me? It's not a joke, Rani. I mean it. Using this act, I tried to learn your feelings about me. What if I refuse to answer you? Then I'll keep wondering, whether you answer or not. - You seem to be obstinate. - Don't give my love this name. - Say that I am yours. - Shyam, it's not in my hands. - I have to ask my heart. - Then why don't you ask now? You're in such a hurry? Okay, I'll ask. - What does it say? - It says 50-50 yes and 50-50 no. My question has been answered.. My my! Tall and handsome! Oh my God, I am dead! Oh my God! - What happened? - I went out and a thorn pricked me, Raja. - Let me see. - No! It's just a thorn, not a sword! - Don't scream! - Raja, don't joke with an injured person. Raja, pick me up and take me to my room. - What's happening here? - A thorn pricked her foot. That's why I'm taking her to her room. Don't! If the landlord comes to know we're such flirts... - then what respect will we have? - As if you have respect now? You're an ordinary man but you talk as if you're a king! Here, take care of your babe! - Why are you crying? - Please pick me up! Why, now your waist hurts, instead of your foot? It's not a good habit to doubt me. - Why were you in his arms? - Let me explain it to you. - What's to explain? - That landlord... - He too? - He's not a real landlord. - What did you say? Enough! Now I know. He's the one who wanted to give Rani a ring? They love each other. You did the right thing, Jalwa. Thank you very much. If Raja should come to know... his heart would break. He would leave my company and we would suffer a loss. Thank you very much, Miss Jalwa. Today I'll treat you to an ice cream! Tell me, will you take my heart? What will you give me in return? Love is priceless If there's a price then it's not true love If you give your heart then you'll get my heart in return I don't want gold or silver I am a slave to real love In return for love, will you give me love? Only then can you take my heart You'll receive love by giving love Then the flowers of my heart will also bloom If you give me joy you'll get back joy in return After all, you used your wealth to win over Rani's heart! Now you're not the same Rani. You've begun having dreams of living in palaces. What you think is love is not love, but just an act. Remember, the one who is playing with you, will tire one day. Such palaces crash as fast as they are built! What will happen now? Raja will go and tell my Baba everything. Don't be frightened, Rani. You come with me. Everything will be alright. Come. - Father... - Whatever Raja told you is correct. - Raja, who is this boy? - Ask your daughter. - Raja didn't tell you anything, father? - No. - But who is he? - I'm not the landlord but his son. I had to enact this so that Rani could be mine. Now I understand why Raja was so quiet. But child, this is not what I expected from you. You didn't do the right thing in hiding your feelings from me. I wouldn't want my daughter to be spurned by a rich man. Don't go by my money. I may be a rich man's son... but this doesn't mean that rich people can't fall in love. A rich man doesn't know love. He can only fool around. Father, Shyam is not like that. Don't doubt my intentions. I've come for your consent. I have vowed that I will marry Rani. - Father! - Before you marry a courtesan... you'll have to kill your father. Understand? Oh! So you are that Rani? My son is dancing to your tune! - You think he can belong to you? - Why not? A theater dancer is dreaming of being my daughter-in-law? Look at yourself. What respect do you command in society? You earn a living by dancing and luring people. You walk on the ground and wish to embrace the skies? - Shyam... - Father! - Shut up! I can't bear to see this girl ruin my family's honor. The house she dreams of marrying into, she can't even step in there! Excuse me. You may be wealthy... but we, too, have self respect. You can talk to me. You have no right to talk to my daughter like that! Your daughter is leading my son down the wrong path. Under the pretext of love, she is eying my wealth. She thinks Shyam will be with her all her life... but Shyam is not a pauper's son. He is a landlord's son! He'll play with her as a toy for a couple of days... and when he tires of her, he'll discard her! We'll see who discards my daughter as long as I live. If your child is dear to you, mine is just as dear to me. If that's so, then leave with her within the next two hours... - or the consequences won't be good. Understand? - Yes. - Who are you? - Tell me who you are. - I am a landlord. - What? A landlord? - Then who is he? - He is my son! Your son? You're the landlord? If you wish to live, leave this place in the next two hours. Or I'll shoot you! May God not show you, I mean us, that day. If you try to ruin my son again, you'll be put in jail! And I'll burn down your theater. Did you get that? I understood! Rani, my father's anger won't compel me to change my mind. When he sees that my life is incomplete without you... then he'll step aside. - And what if this doesn't happen? - It'll happen. Perhaps, he doesn't like you working in a theater. If you promise to leave this job, I'll convince him, too. The theater is not more dear to me than you. Forget the theater. I can leave this world for you. Come home with me! - What are you thinking, Raja? - Nothing. What I thought was elixir, turned out to be poison. Forget what happened. We meet people and then we part ways. But I never thought like that. When we both wandered around... we became each other's companions. Now Rani's life is different. She doesn't need me. I understand your pain. But remember, the one who falls in love, wins in love. I'll try to talk to your father. - He may get convinced. - How can you convince me? Your son is walking on the path to destruction... and you're encouraging him? If he continues to be like this, one day you'll lose your son! When did I encourage him? You're saying without even... Mother, you go. I'll deal with him myself. - Did you write this letter to Rani? - Yes. I stopped you from having any connection with Rani, right? Then why are you still writing love letters to her? - I don't wish to answer. - I don't need your answers. You can't do as you please staying in my house. What I say goes here! You will get married only to Purnima. I will only marry Rani. No other girl can come in my life. Don't ever think that Rani can take Purnima's place! Don't think that I'll break Purnima's heart to please you! I can sacrifice you but I can't break Purnima's heart! Get it? Yes! Shyam, what did I do to you that you're ruining my life like this? - Why are you spurning me now? - When did I make you my own? But I always considered myself as yours. Since I have grown up, this is what I've always heard... that I will marry you. You will be my husband. I don't look at you the way you look at me. I promised Rani I'll marry her. And what about those promises you made to me when we were kids? Those feelings ended with our childhood. - Forget about it. - Maybe you can forget... but not I. I remember each and every thing. You loved me so much. You couldn't be away from me for a moment. At that age, I didn't know what love was. But, after I met Rani, I realized that I love her. I only empathize with you. Obviously, you'll empathize with me. I'm an orphan. I don't deserve your love. That's why you can forget me... and marry Rani. She can sing and dance and entertain you. I have nothing else besides my service to you. Purnima, my child! You may forget my love for you... but I can never forget you If you spurn me and go, I shall spurn this world Why have you rejected a poor girl's heart? Now how can anyone make my ill-fate shine again? The agony you have caused to my heart... how can I conceal that? You have ruined my life. What more can I say? Although you have cheated me, I can't call you a betrayer You said whatever you had to say But I will keep repeating the same thing If you spurn me and go, I shall spurn this world - Who locked the door? - I have! What for? Open the door! The door won't open! I always desired that your wedding with Purnima... should be with so much pomp that people should talk about it! But, you didn't let me fulfill my desire. But I'll fulfill my promise. Until you agree to marry Purnima... you'll be locked in this room! And this marriage will take place in a day or two! Understand? It won't be a wedding. You'll be ruining two lives! We all will be ruined, doomed... If you don't work in the theater it will be destroyed. - I can't change my mind now. - Don't be adamant, Rani. This is a matter of my life and death. The tickets for Sunday's show are sold out. People will come with the desire to see you... and if you're not there then you know the fate of my theater. - Please say yes, Rani. - It's not possible, Mr, Gope. I am so unhappy. How can I dance on the stage? We separate our personal and professional lives, Rani. If you keep moping for your love then how will you move ahead? - Don't compel me. - Don't compel you? I'm going bankrupt here and you say I shouldn't force you? Mr. Gope, look for another heroine. If this is so then I will surely look for another heroine. I'll get as many heroines I want! There's no shortage of them. Who do you think you are? I made her an artist and she's throwing tantrums at me! Raja, do you know Rani won't work in the theater now? She's suffering from the fever of love! Who asked you to get her to my theater? Mr. Gope, for God's sake, don't run salt in my wounds. Raja, please forgive me. I've made a mistake. I can understand your pain. I should be talking to you. - With me? - Yes, Rani is your daughter. - Why don't you convince her? - What is she saying? Nothing! She just makes deeps sighs. If she stops working in the theater, how will she earn? She can't fill her stomach with love. She's naive. Give her some time and she'll come around. Oh, so she is naive! But when will she come around? After I go bankrupt? Alright, I'll try talking with her. - Sir, letter. - This isn't the right time. Get out! Hey, wait! I said get out and you're going? Now you don't have to talk to her. This letter will explain everything. Please do me a favor. Just take this letter to Rani. Child, you've not done the right thing by refusing to work. I don't like this work. People don't respect the ones working in theater. People don't appreciate true talent. Talent enhances life. It doesn't ruin it. But this talent has ruined my life, Baba. If I hadn't been worked in theater the landlord... wouldn't have called me a courtesan. Don't talk about that man. He's too pompous. He has too much pride in his wealth. Yet, I will not go on the stage. I wish to go far away from this life. Shyam is supporting me. If I don't leave the theater... - then he'll leave me. - He's already gone. His love was a phase which has passed now. - What are you saying? - Your answers lie in this letter. Letter? Rani, tomorrow Shyam is getting married. Wedding music will play here. Shyam will dress as a groom. I invite you to come and dance on this occasion. Please at least come and see Shyam dressed up as a groom. I'll pay you whatever price you ask. Baba, I'll work in the theater. She will work! Thank you. What's the matter? Why are you laughing like a mad man? The matter is such, if you knew, that you'd go mad, too. - You'll also laugh. - I have forgotten how to laugh. First I could laugh at the state of my heart. Now I can't laugh at all. I bet you'd laugh if you heard this and go crazy like me! Listen to me. That man who made tall claims of love... has moved ahead. My dear man, Shyam is getting married. - Shyam's getting married? - Yes, but not with Rani... with someone else. Rani will work in the theater. Now laugh. Why aren't you laughing? I understand. The wound in your heart is too deep. My words can't heal it. But don't worry. The one that caused the wound can heal it, too. You are ready, my child. Come on. Shyam! Ran away! - Take Purnima inside. This wedding is cancelled! - Why? - Shyam ran away! - Ran away? He has disgraced me. I can't face anyone now! Oh, the one who has rejected and me and gone... do me a favor and spurn me once more You have snatched my right to marry you Now, walk over these wedding garlands, too Oh, the one who has rejected me... you have snatched away my world of desires You have snatched away my desire to smile You snatched my happiness and have given me tears The one for whom my heart prayed day and night... the irony is... that same person has broken my heart You have rendered me homeless in my own house... just when I was nearing my destination of love This one has snatched the destination of my life Child, how long will you mourn like this? Shyam's love was like a gust of wind. It came and passed by. You should erase his memory from your mind. Raja loves you. He's living in the hope that one day you'll accept him. But Baba, Raja never told me anything. Fool! You can't talk and you wanted to fall in love? - Did you hear what Rani said? - What's that? She has no idea that you love her. If she had known, then she wouldn't have fallen for Shyam. - So what do I do now? - Go to hell! - Where are you going? - To hell. I said and you're going? Mister, love is like an art. I'm not a fool like you. - I know it. One, two, three. - I meant 'A R T'! I mean talent. One learns this with passing time. If you didn't know, you could have asked your teacher. For God's sake, teach me how to love, Mr. Gope! I will never forget your favor. If I ever love, I will remember you. Then listen to the first lesson of true love. Look into her eyes and then smile a little. Your teeth should be seen, like this. Then put your hand on your chest. Not both, only one. Put your right hand on your left breast. - The heart is on the left. - I know. In police service, I used to carry my gun on this side. They taught you to use a gun, not fall in love. Let me explain. Rule number one in love is... you have to explain it with your eyes. But Raja, I don't think you can do this. There's no emotion in your eyes. - Should I wear glasses? - Then it will be worse. Then your eyes won't even be seen. Let me tell you a simple way. Rule number two in love... has to do with expressing using words. I mean, the old plays of the theater, like Laila Majnu, Shirin Farhad. Remember those love tales and narrate them to Rani. - I know. You are my Laila... - Was Laila so fat? - I don't know. - You don't? Then go inside and see. Had my fate made me a necklace of Laila's neck What's wrong with you, Raja? Oh my love, do visit me once in a while. Let me also fulfill my desires, once in a while. - Stop joking! - Laila, Laila, I call out in the forests. But, my Laila resides in my heart. Rani, your looks have pierced my heart. I am restless. I keep waiting for you. Lift your veil, let me see your face. Let me feast on your eyes and make me lucky. - Come close to me. - What nonsense is this, Raja? Something's wrong with you. Should I call a doctor? You've caused the pain; you cure me. Don't call a doctor. I don't understand. What's going on? This is romance. I mean, I'm expressing my love to you. But to express your love, why do you need to be so dramatic? You were just telling your father that I never expressed my love. Oh, so you were expressing your love? - And who taught you to do this? - My teacher. - Did it have any effect? - Raja, don't try to change yourself. I like your simplicity. I like you the way you are. - Really? - Yes, Raja. - Hey you, a rainy day frog! - Where is it? Why are you giggling like this? - Are you alright? - Teacher, Rani says that... - What? - She loves me and she's fond of me. - Did you see how my words worked? - Forget it! Rani told me that she likes me the way I am. She likes my simplicity, my fatso! - Lay your hands off! - If you want to learn, ask me, pigeon! Get lost, what can you teach me! Hey! Did he abuse me? - Shyam's father... - What happened? - We're doomed. - Purnima... - What about Purnima? - She... - Tell me what happened? - She has left! - Where? - I don't know. She left this letter. Left a letter? I'm going to look for him. If I find him, I'll return. Otherwise, you'll never see me again. The joy of love does not last long... and the grief lasts a lifetime Is this life worth living... if our life is smothered? At times I go quiet. Other times I complain But, at times I do miss that betrayer When separated from my love, there are two things I miss When I think of anything else besides crying... I miss him Oh my separated love, let me wallow in my grief You can settle down in love somewhere else - Mr. Gope, Shyam has come back. - What? So what if he's here? - But he's married now! - But he's still blocking my way. He has no right to ruin my happiness. If he tries to lure Rani again, then he'll have to face my wrath. Maybe the landlord's son doesn't know... that Gope has as much respect in Mumbai as his father has back home. Then do something, Mr. Gope. Think of a solution... so this thorn is plucked from my path, forever. Don't worry Raja. I'll teach Shyam a proper lesson. In spite of being married, how dare he eye my heroine? - He's not married. - Not married? - Yes. For Rani's love, he called off his marriage. - How do you know? - I heard it myself. Shyam looked at Rani. Rani smiled back at him. They danced together and Rani is very happy. Rani's very happy? My parents locked me up, forcibly tried to get me married. But I've broken all shackles and come back to my love. I thought you would never come. I can leave this world, but not leave you. Everyone asked me to forget you. You'd never come back and... only played with my feelings. Rani, I did play, but I risked my own life, too. Shyam, are you cheating me by showing me dreams of love? No, but if you don't trust me, then come along with me. We'll get married right now. What's the hurry? Like you, I'm scared all the time... that people may separate us again. But, I can't go with you without my father's permission. And what if he refuses? He won't. He'll do anything for the sake of my happiness. Shyam, I want to talk to you. I know what you want to tell me. No, you don't know anything. Come with me. Sit down, Shyam. I want to tell you many things. - Tell me. - You know very well that... Rani is the love of my life. I've forgotten my own life for her sake. But, I've also given up everything for her sake. I've given up my own parents for her sake. Then one of us has to give up on our hopes... and accept defeat. That has been decided. No, I will decide that. - What do you mean? - I have loved Rani. I haven't played with her emotions. If she loved you, she wouldn't think of me as her love. I'm a comedian of the stage. I make people laugh. I couldn't express my feelings to Rani. I misunderstood her coy smiles. She empathized with me and I thought it was love. Shyam, for her sake, I can sacrifice all my happiness. Tomorrow, with my own hands, I'll hand her over to you. Rani will be very happy to get her love... and I'll be happy losing my love. Nothing serious. They're small bruises. She'll be fine in a while. - I'll send some medicine. - Please have it sent quickly. - Good bye. - Thank you. Madam Rani, Sir Raja is calling you. Tell him I'm coming. - Raja, you called me? - Yes Rani, please sit down. - I want to talk to you. - What about? Something you don't expect me to say. - What does that mean? - You know it very well that... for so long, I kept worshiping you silently. In my heart, I always loved you. But I couldn't express my feelings. And when I got the chance, you had fallen in love with Shyam. What's the point of talking about the past? I'm helpless. You didn't understand my feelings for you... but I can't see your desires getting burned by grief. I love you and I always will. You can ask anything. I don't mind getting tortured in love. But I won't let you be disappointed. - What are you saying, Raja? - Shyam is your love. I won't destroy that. I will get you married to him tomorrow. Why, don't you trust me? I'm not doing anything exceptional. This is how true love is supposed to be. I will see you getting settled and feel happy about it. - But what about you? - I'll live with your memories. - Sir... - Yes, Jalwa. - A marriage will take place. - Our marriage? No, Shyam and Rani's. What? Shyam and Rani's wedding? Yes, and Raja will get them married. Raja will personally get them married? No, this can't happen. If you value your life then leave with your men within two hours. If you try to spoil my son, I'll send you to jail. I'll burn down your theater, get it? No, this wedding can't take place! Who are you? Where is your house? House? You have snatched that away from me. What are you saying? I'm the one whose happiness you snatched to make your life better. The one whose love you snatched and now want to marry. Oh! So you're the one Shyam was supposed to marry? I'm the one. You've separated my childhood love from me. We were engaged when we were kids. We played and laughed together. He made promises of love to me... and when the time to fulfill it arrived... you came and snatched my Shyam from me. A dancer like you can never see anybody settle down. You only know how to crush someone's happiness. You have snatched my Shyam from me. Now please kill me. I wish to die! Don't save me. I wish to die! - Sir... - You've come back again? Yes. Sir, please don't get angry. I've come here as a friend. - What are you trying to say? - Your dear son, Shyam... has run away from home and united with Rani again. What? Married? This can never happen. Understand? Exactly. If this wedding takes place, your honor will be tainted. And nobody will ever visit my theater. - How dare he do this! - I have just done my duty. Now, further, you handle your son. - Good bye. - Wait! Can I be of any help? Shyam, you are my only friend. And I'm adorning you as a groom today. Don't worry. Very soon, you'll get married, too. No Shyam, I was born a bachelor. I will die a bachelor. Look at my hand. There's no marriage line in my fate. That's no big deal. I can draw that line with a knife. - Only a knife can create it. - Hey, stop worrying. Jalwa, you all wait here. I'll return right away. Come back soon. Your beloved must be getting restless. Oh, it's you? Why are you adorned like this? Don't you know? I'm going to belong to my beloved today. - I am getting married. - To whom? - To Shyam. - Shyam? You're not a woman. You're a witch! - This isn't possible! - Shyam, don't stop your hands. Put the garland around her. She deserves you. She genuinely loves you. I've no status compared to you. How can you say that after I risked my life for you? I know that you love me. It is not love. It's just a pretense. I am a theater actor. How can I understand what true love is? I was eying your wealth. Love was a mere excuse. That's a lie. You're deceiving yourself. No, you're fooling yourself. You were lured by my style and gait... but my intentions weren't clear. Whoever falls for this deceit strays from the facts of life. True love is like Purnima's, silent and contented. I'm like a wave that lashes the shore and erodes it. We dancers earn our living with the sway of our dance and style. I can't settle in marriage, and she suits your family status. I'm a theater girl. I'm not worthy of your family's status. Put the garland around her. She deserves you. Sister! You called me sister, so now let me do my duty as a sister. My blessings are with you. May you have a long married life! - May you be happy! - Where is that dancer... who has destroyed my son's life? - Purnima, you? - Take care of your daughter-in-law. - Bless her. - No, you deserve my blessing, my child. I misunderstood you. Please forgive me. Where is Raja, Mr. Gope? I just saw him going outside, but I don't know where he went. The one who has never fallen in love... he may live for long, but I say that life isn't worth living But sometimes It's nice to have someone in your heart But sometimes It's nice to have someone reside in your heart Only sometimes If there was no love in the world, would life be worth living? Nobody would sigh in peace, nobody would cry in anguish The one who smiles in love, it's nice to shed tears Only sometimes It is nice to burn in someone's love But sometimes If the flame does not burn then who will appreciate a firefly? In the absence of a flame, why would a firefly burn himself out? It is nice to burn in desire for someone But sometimes
