POWER GAMES All my life I liked taking chances. The feeling of being on the verge of danger. The overwhelming power. That's when you feel you exist. That's when I went to New York... and I became a broker. To test your luck. Challenge fate. Many try, but few can. You lose faster of what you earn... but when you win, you win big. Very much so. It takes talent. And a lot of stomach. You can't be weak. To last, you need instinct of survival. And intuition. To feel the market. Anticipate it. This is the talent. And I have that talent. Hurry, you're late. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - What about the news? - All the same. Are you coming? So I recommend buying position in the next three to six months. That's it today. Thank you for your attention. Any comments? What that means, for three to six months? When do we start buying? Now, in 3 or 6 months? I'm an economist, I can't predict luck. I'm giving you a vision long-term statistics. So you don't go out on the field. Georges, if you have better ideas, I'm listening. If I were you, with your NLP, I wouldn't lecture anyone. For the rest of us... I want to remind you that you are late in their goals. There's only three months left in the year. If you want a big bonus, should do something about it. Show me your chips. It's time to show of what they're made of. Let's get motivated. I want to see something done. - Are you coming? - The pattern is familiar. Really? Not for me. Erwan, it's going to open. Henry, you ready? We need 50 million at the end of the year. At the moment, we have nothing. Relax, Georges. I'll send you my prices. Let's do it, boys. I've got the boiling point. There's money to be made. Do you smell it? Audacity! Come on, it's on. - Check the values. - You can leave. Done. NASDAQ is stable. What a bad day. We'll barely make 10 million this year. Small bonus, a hundred thousand at most. That's bad. How will I survive? Olga's a shopaholic. I'd be better off leaving her. The year's not over yet. - How about a drink? - Not today. - What's the matter? - It's that graph. - Getting superstitious again? - Exactly. SIBYLLE MAHLER ASSISTANT TEACHER SCIENCE DEPARTMENT ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC - Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. - Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Sibylle Mahler? Go right. - Thank you. Thank you. - You're welcome. Sibylle Mahler? Erwan Kermor, broker of the Universal Market Bank. - Can you give me a minute? - Now? Just to show you a chart. There. It's the same, see? Here. And here. See? - You're very imaginative. - That's not the point. It's your article. The same pattern. Exactly the same. See. There, look. Isn't that obvious? There are patterns like that everywhere. I'd bet high to prove you wrong. You're wasting your time. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Okay. Okay, okay, okay. Thanks for listening to me. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Miss Mahler? You again? I wanted to apologize. For what? I think you misunderstood... my intentions. You're not the type to give up. Can we get some coffee? Don't you miss Paris? Not really. Now I'm here and maybe in a few years... go to work in a lab in London. Stanford would be nice. Did I say something funny? Not at all. I was thinking that you wouldn't I'd imagine you were a scientist. Why shouldn't I? I don't know. I had someone else in mind. Plus the thick glasses type and braces... thick socks, fat fingers. All big. What a cliché. Typical Wall Street. Totally closed mind. Labelling everything. - Is that who we are? - That's what it looks like. So, in terms of clichés, we agreed. We agree. That's all I'm asking. You're a strange guy. Incredibly unpleasant. And very charming. - I'll consider it a compliment. - Of course. - It's late. - Yeah. Yeah. I have to prepare my classes. Hey, Debbie. Where are you going? I have a meeting with a client. For production, must be big fish. Looks like it takes the dog by the collar. And he swings his ass. - I know my job. - Of course I do. If you need escorts, we're here. Thanks, but I already have a pimp. - Hi, William. - Hello, William. Ready to go? - Bye, guys. - Bye, guys. Oh, shit! And she's single! And your miserable bonus you're gonna change that? Wait till you know who it's gonna be number one at the end of the year. You're wrong. Fuck you, Kermor. I'll send it back to Vichi, you traitor. - Hello? - It's Sibylle Mahler. I've studied your chart. You did good. Your guess was right. The pattern you identified... happens every day, month, year and decade. It's virtually infallible. It's everywhere. It's a schematic of human activity. Do you understand? The signature of humanity. It signals the last 50 years of climate change. The increase of all kinds of cataclysms. It's irrefutable proof... the effect of the market on the climate. If I understand correctly... your scheme predicts market trends? Exactly. Can you trust her? She's brilliant. Incredibly literate. Did you test her scheme? We made comparisons retroactive to 1929. Now let's get started a virtual negotiation. - What's up, Tony? - All the same. If it really worked... Georges, I totally believe that. Applying climate schemes on a small scale... with you the "market weather". I can predict changes short-term with accuracy. The smaller the lapse of time, the better. See this cube? It represents world markets. Each point means a potential change. The schema maintains itself locating the best positions. Look. Here he isolates a good position. Now he calculates the odds. You see that? Are your numbers right? Of course. - Okay. Okay, okay, okay, okay. - What does that mean? Guess what? Are you all right? Come on, let's go. No! I don't want to. - Did you have fun? - That's amazing. Awesome. What's this little scar? I can't imagine. You never asked your parents? I didn't know them. Okay. Okay, okay, okay. Take care of yourself. We'll talk later. It's confirmed. I'll explain. You see this sign? It announces a 5% to 10% correction. Here, in the stock market in low 2003. In the credit crunch of 2004. And when Hang-Seng fell. Every time, the market falls later. It's time to act. According to the schematic, ...he'll fall tonight. - Our prediction says something else. - Fuck our prediction! I tested it every month. It works. It works! How much do we put in? - One billion. - A billion? It's now or never. We can't go that far. What about risk control? We'll use our cell phones. We'll be done tonight. They won't understand until too late. Until then, you'll be so rich, who will be flattering us. That's dangerous. If the market loses 10%, they'll make 100 million. We'll get a $5 million bonus! Do you understand that? Problems will be over. The debts will end. No more worrying about pensions. A one-way ticket to Rio for you and Olga... and the fun begins! Ten thousand in the long run. Are you kidding? Are you kidding me? A 10,000 installment in installments. A hint? No one is selling uncovered. I'll explain later, give the price. Just give me a second. Give me an estimate of 10,000 in the long run now. Michael, 10,000 on credit, give me something good. - 36 to 39 for ten grand. - I speak. 36 to 39 for 10,000. What do you think? 36 a 39... ten thousand out of 39. He's increasing the offer, is accepting the 10,000. Okay, done. - It's done, boss. - Right. THE CHIPS ARE DOWN. Personal, no buyer since this morning. I'll call you if I see anything. Maybe I'll fall into the lockdown. You want to call her? Are you still sure? The market is overheated. I'm still sure. - Check, just in case. - Right. - Take care of yourself. - You, too. 60,000 at market price. It's up 2%. We lost 10 million. 30 minutes to close. - Predictions confirmed? - 90% accurate. Why only 90%? What do you mean? I don't foresee the future. Okay. Okay, okay, okay. I'll call you back. What did she say? It's okay, she confirmed it. What are we gonna do? Where's Georges? He left some time ago. Shit. Georges? What are you up to? The market is closing. What will we do? I can't think straight. Because you risked too much! Don't screw it up. Stay with me, damn it. Trust me. Are you masturbating each other? We're waiting you come to participate. I'm sorry, Georges, I don't... on extra-small penises. You'd rather lick ass. - I'm gonna lick it! - Imbecile! My goal is 5 billion this year. and so far, I've got six. - Yeah, one more. - What about my $2 million bonus? That would be nice. You'll make it one day. Now I can't sign anything. I'm waiting the complete results. You have to play more in a team and act in a group. It's easy to talk about playing as a team when he gets the biggest slice. If you don't like that... you can move on. Many other brokers would stay happy to be in your place. I'm sure of it. But you don't have my leads. They don't have your leads, your legs or your beautiful face. But they're very young. and very ambitious. In time, you will know who you know, you like it or not. I'm sure it'll be a lot easier get them into bed, too. I feel like I didn't go out with you is going against me. Listen to yourself. You're forgetting that. É. Congratulations. But I'm not sure who I feel sorry for. - How's business? - It's like this sometimes. - They'll see that tomorrow, right? - For your sake. PROFITS AND LOSSES Oh, shit! - The report. - I'm busy. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. Wait for Tokyo. I'm sure you'll fall. It's a matter of hours. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. Olga! I've been here for days calling you. I'll be right there. A 24-year-old model. Did you think it would last forever? Forget her, girls like that there are dozens of them. Wake up, Georges. What do you think? He showed you the good life. You gave him a nice apartment... fancy clothes, a nice car. She stayed when she was well. But deep down... she's just another bitch. Isn't that right, Erwan? Get girls like this at any time. Do you understand me? That's me. Tokyo opened at 1.25. We screwed up, that doesn't work. Now what? It's gonna be okay. There is still London. It'll work there. Keep me posted. Take care of yourself. Come on, Georges. Prove it, Georges. You'll see, it's pure. It's a good thing. Just sit back. Come on. LONDON OPENED AT +0.85%. Okay, okay, okay, okay. We screwed up. It's not the first time. It's the first time they've cost $30 million to the bank. But tomorrow we'll make $300 million. Give us one day, just one more. We'll turn around, ...we'll make a lot of money... is guaranteed, I swear. That could sink the whole bank. Don't be angry. Can I explain? Can you explain? Not to be angry? Explain what? Who hid their intentions... and exceeded your individual limits? You're fired! They'll explain to a judge. You can't do that, no. after the years we've known each other. You shouldn't have tried! We'll be marked at the market, we'll never work again. It's not my problem, I don't care. Give us one more chance. Just one. - Get out of my way. - Just give us... - Out. - William! Asshole, we made millions for you. - Do you remember? - Look at me. You'll pay for it. You'll pay for it! - Asshole! - Out! You forgot something. What's that? What's that? Give it a rest, back off. - What's that? What's that? - Get out of here. Have a nice trip. Would you like some coffee? I'm going home. I'm sorry, Georges. É. Your turn. You want to hang up? - Hello? - It's falling. Dow's down 2%. - We were right! - I'll call Georges. Thank you. Thank you. If I may... Thank you. Thank you. Erwan! I've heard that they... have dropped the lawsuit. What are you gonna do now? I don't know. I don't know. If you want to work in the market, I have leads. Thank you. Thank you. It's not your fault. I couldn't have known that he would do that. Damn... We were this close! Close like this! There's no point in insisting on that. Now it's over. Good morning, welcome. to the St. Paul's Club. Is that right? I have an appointment with Mr. Bradigan. He must be in the back. In his usual place. Okay. Okay, okay, okay. Thank you. Mr. Kremor, I presume. Sit down. Sarah told me she wants to start an investment fund. Yeah, I found out a revolutionary scheme. You're not the first, you know. I've seen hundreds think they had discovered the Holy Grail. Create investment funds and they'll have nothing in months. I can guarantee that my scheme is solid. I've already tested it. I've got $5 million and I need $25 million for starters. Margin of five, that's a lot. My goal is 40%. before the first year. I need to play hardball. I see. Well... What guarantees can you offer? I have some bills, we make about five million. Sarah was right. You're really ambitious. - Yes, I am. - I like that. - Who's this? - It's Sarah. - Sarah! - Your bottom's in the front. - You see that? - My congratulations. I guess that could... to interest my clients. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Is it an offer? What do you think? Excellent! Tell me about it. What's that? What's that? My letter of resignation. You're hurting me. I'm sure it's short and sweet. It's good to think it over before you leave. from a firm like this. I got an offer that I can't refuse. May I ask from whom? The Flying Fund. Never heard of it. Who's the manager? Erwan Kermor. Does it look familiar? See you later, honey. Little bitch! - Harold Dune. - Hello. Your badge. Hello. Who's he? Harold Dune. He has recently become... one of the 500 largest U.S. fortunes. - What about them? - Corporate accounts... insurance companies, pension funds. What's going on? They are here. I'm coming. I'm nervous. It's gonna be okay. Just relax. What are you doing? What are you doing? Concluding the presentation, this is the performance chart. As you can see, the Flyind Fund, here... clearly stands out of your competitors. I'll be happy to answer to any question. Thank you. I heard six months ago, who lost a lot of money. Was it with your scheme? Well, I appreciate the question. It gives me a chance to straighten things out. I had to close the position too soon... because of the limits and risk management. If we had one more day... we would have won the bank's biggest bonus. It means you're against manage risks and limits? Not at all. But we have to measure them. Optimising them, tailoring them. Any more questions? Mine's for Sibylle Mahler. What kind of scam do you use? Classic or of a later generation? - Listen, uh... - Sibylle? I'm sorry, but we're not here to reveal secrets to the competition. I think, since potential investors... we have the right to some information. Sir, if you want guarantees, look at my numbers. They speak for themselves. Ask us to trust based solely on his performance... but you risk our money. What is your personal investment? in your background? Well, I mortgaged my apartment and my personal accounts. I've put everything I've got in this project. All of it. I believe him. Really. I'm back. And I'm going to beat the market. A few more customers. They keep coming. We have a billion to work with. That's too much. Did you hear that, Tony? A billion! Look. William and Miller. - Hey, what's up? - It's falling! We won 20 million! As I predicted. - What are we gonna do? - We wait. How much are we losing? 200 million and falling. Leave it all, okay? William, if we leave now, we lost all the profits of the year. You have 20 seconds to do that. or you'll be out of a job. Buy protection for 1 billion at market price. - Okay, okay, okay, okay. - Work on it. Ladies, can you hear me? He needs the price now! - How much? - A hundred million. Sell everything. Get all the money. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea! - You did it! The garbage of a is the treasure of another. Yes. I need to get back to the office. A problem has arisen. "I am the invisible hand of the market." Who does this guy think he is? I think he's a charlatan, a fool playing in a casino. I don't think so. Increase of 40% since last year. In my years in this business, I've never seen anything like it. His background exists for less. of a year, it might just be luck. Lucky? No, no. It's his scam. He's a generation in front of the competitors. So he thought the Philosopher's Stone. Did anyone predict the credit crunch? Nobody but him. Right, Mr. President? I admit I was surprised. I had to take emergency measures... or our markets would be in danger. Everything's under control. Oh, come on! It's a big bluff. Kermor's a con man, you know that. I prefer a con man... to incompetence. I should have given you back the job when I had the chance. In the meantime, continue with the program, or else... Oh, shit! From now on, we have a primary objective. Find the Flying Fund and beat it. Find your brokers, as much as you can. Follow your positions. I need results, right? If we don't reach the finish line... by the end of the year... there will be a price. I'm in front of him. Get the hell out of here. The meeting is over. Close the door! Sibylle Mahler? Who is this? - The Science Magazine. - In the speakerphone. I'll transfer you. Hello? Juan Emilio Gonzales. Science Magazine. We want to publish your article. - Which one? - I'd rather tell you in person. Should we schedule a lunch this week? I'm afraid I don't have time. Douglas! How do you do? Erwan? How do you do? Listen, asshole, try to contact her... ...again and I'll break your neck! Do you understand? Now go away! Oh, shit! I was watching, the euro is falling. Looks like it's owned by Kermor. How do you know that, John? Last time, it was nothing! You're the one who knows, but if I wouldn't wait. Shit. William, we've got the euro down. Do we follow? Yeah, go ahead. Let me see. There's 10 million left. You must be the asshole. John, we have 10 million. Come on, we want it and now. Then walk! - I only got 50 million. - I asked for a hundred! They're all doing just like you. I told you to be discreet. Now they're imitating us! Be discreet about buying a hundred million? Then buy less. How do I invest $2 billion? Damn it, we'll take $50 million from the asshole. Good work, boys. Those vultures are on top of us. Our profits are low. We need new positions. It's coming... We invest only 10% of our new clients. It's not much. It's normal. We have ten times as many resources. Normal... Why did I spend $2 million on IT? I do the best I can. I don't work miracles. The board will love that. Give me your fucking scam! I'm exhausted. Then drop the pills. Pay attention. You'd better find someone else. I'm getting out of here. Where were you? Where were you? Aren't you going to tell me? I'm sorry, I don't know what got into me. It won't happen again, I promise. I don't recognize you. You're not yourself. They're all after me. Do you understand? I'm suffocating. - That's no excuse. - I know, I know... I need you. You have validated the October performance? I had lunch with Arthur Bradigan. He's starting getting impatient. I have no idea. I'm not an accountant. We're a month late. This is the legal limit. Fuck him. How's that? Talk like this at tomorrow's meeting and you'll regret it. We have an order of $79 million. At last, What took you so long? What are we gonna do? That must be him. I feel it. Let's go hard. Very strong! - Five billion! - God! - Up to $9 billion! - This exceeds our limits! It does, doesn't it? Damn me if I sit around while he makes a fortune. Then let's go, let's go! It was spinning. Everyone was selling before. We've got nothing. How did we do in October? We're up 0.5%. Erwan, come here. Hurry, hurry, hurry. It's getting worse and worse. It's no use. He doesn't capture anything. Filters? They give me the same result. Damn it! Just interference. The market has updated itself. They are imitating us. We can't predict anything. That's not possible! What am I gonna tell the board? The truth. The scheme is dead. That's impossible! Don't you understand? You've won enough. We liquidated and left. How's that? Are you on their side now? What's the matter with you? - They're all against me. - Take it easy. You're not gonna get me! You're not gonna get me! Erwan Kermor, leave a message. Where were you? I hope you have the numbers. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. What about Sibylle? She's not with you? I think she's sick. He just arrived. Well... Gentlemen, I know what you're waiting for, and I won't keep the suspense. Last month's figures ...have gone up 3%... which leaves us at 40%. at 55% by the end of the year. Bravo, Erwan, you're the best. On behalf of the creditors... I want to congratulate you for exceptional performance. If you agree, I want to invest another 500 million in your fund. $600 million. And me, with 400 million. Another 200 million of mine. $300 million. I understand your enthusiasm, but, as you know... you can't direct that like a sports car. If you want to keep the numbers, you gotta give me more time off. State your terms. I want to change the status of the fund... including complete deletion of my risk tolerance. I've already increased your margin from 5 to 10. When you risk a billion.., I'll risk 10. I need to protect my bank. I understand, but you must admit that my scheme proved to work. I will continue to finance it... if I double my commission. Liber plus 1%. Closed. Gentlemen, the board of directors validates the proposal... of removing risk limits entered in the fund's statutes. The fund has reached 4 billion. Good work, gentlemen. All right! All right! Daring! Everything you do you sweat daring! Tony, buy 40 billion in the future market. Forty billion? - I have full power. - What if the market changes? Risk everything. Henry, are you there? Buy everything. Repeat. I didn't hear. Buy all the futures, $500 million minimum. S&P, Euro Stoxx, Nikkei. Everyone will find out! Do as I say. You'll see. I'm looking for a size in the future market. Find me the value of 500. Am I speaking another language? Now! I want it now! Let's get going. Without delay. Come on, buy, buy. Find Erwan. Follow him. Okay? Let's go! It's starting. They're all imitating. I knew it. I knew it. As never seen before. Your advocate is to make a statement. Guys, the president of the council will talk. Ladies and gentlemen. I decided to go to the market to call to order. In terms of the fundamental economy... the exuberance shown in the marketplace is irrational. It's my duty to call the brokers to reason... and warn the creators of trouble... We're screwed. We won't leave the market for the manipulation... Is that enough? We made a hundred million. That asshole's not gonna stop me! We hold our positions. Henry, let's hold our positions. He wants war? Right! the institution of investors long term. Don't be fooled by the attraction of blind speculation. The reaction to the declaration of the president of the Federal Reserve... was immediate. Erwan Kermor, Wall Street star... feels that it was personally deployed... and demands a right of reply. We are in contact with him now... for an interview exclusive live. - What's going on? - Look. You'll see. Erwan Kermor is here, thank you for talking to us. You're in charge. the investment fund... the most successful on the planet. Today, for the first time, has agreed to go public. It's the veiled accusations of the president of the Federal Reserve... who suggested your involvement in the recent market explosion? The way I see it, the president no longer holds... no legitimate power about the market. He's a guardian. of an obsolete system... that belongs to the past. The market is a set of riches... of a minority that sees it happen every day. We need to abolish the limits imposed... by incompetent governments and outdated institutions. Nothing important has happened without taking any chances. And nobody, not even us, can predict the future of the world. We have a quota of uncertainty. Let's get free of our currents. Now the world is ours. We are the future. You heard the man. The world is ours. All right, back to work. Let's go. They're all imitating you. It's total madness. Just a minute. What's the matter? We won a billion. Is that enough? No. Let's stand firm. What the hell? Hey, look. They're all imitating. Tonight, 2 billion. Tomorrow, four. The next day, eight. - The scam is dead. - Dead and reborn. I run the market now. You need a scam. I have no need. People believe in me. They trust me. You're crazy. You can't understand. It's over. I'm leaving. Erwan, do you like them? They are my sisters. They're for you. Hello! Erwan, for you. I'm marrying that girl. Sarah, you look beautiful. Good night. - Is Sibylle here? - I can't imagine. - And Erwan? - I can't imagine. I don't know. I really don't know. Hello, Sibylle? - Where are you? - At home. What's going on? It's a long story. Can I come see you? - If you want to. - I'm going. I'll see you later. She's usually on time. Good morning, Sarah. This is Mr. Hunt. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - Please, sit down. - Thank you. Let's get started, there's no time to waste. So I'm listening its conditions. $10 million. - It's a high value. - I am open to negotiations. William, so do I. $10 million is acceptable. Now give us the schematic. There's no more scam. But I have a confession on tape... of Sibylle Mahler... if you want to hear it. Okay, I get it. The scam is dead. He himself went extinct. The market finally accompanied him. He risked everything, he bet everything he had. He was bluffing. He's gonna do the market plummets. - Would you like a translation? - No. Sell everything. Sell everything. Listen up! Hurry. Walk fast. What are you waiting for? His scheme was a lie. I'm not kidding. Walk and sell the futures. I've got three billion to unload. - What is it? What is it? - Hours ago... I am trying to talk to you. - What's the matter with that? - The market has opened downwards. They're all selling for no reason. Where are we at? Answer me, damn it! We're losing 400 million. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Buy everything. Call Henry. Tell him to raise the market. I'm on my way! PROFITS AND LOSSES I'll never make it. I'll never make it. Tony, what do I do? Come in! Are you there? DOW JONES INDEX Tony? Tony? Tony? PROFITS AND LOSSES Tony? Is anyone there? Henry! Where were you? Here's chaos! He's in free fall! What's going on? There's a rumor spreading. - What rumor? - That your scheme is garbage. Oh, crap. Buy what you can. This time, no one will follow. Do as I say! Mr. Kermor, it's Andrew Smith. No answer to the request for cover. You've exceeded your limit. I don't understand. You have an hour to to get $200 million. Okay. Okay, okay, okay. Call my main creditor... you'll get the deposit. I'll ask for more coverage. Mr. Bradigan refuses to pay... something else for the Flying Fund. Give me $200 million now, I'll go back to the top, I swear. Scammer. You lied to us. about your performance... and now you dare ask for more? They're gonna suspend me. That's what he deserves, to be suspended. Because of you, I've already lost 20 billion... and I'm coming on the verge of bankruptcy! Believe me, I'll stand again. You'll have it all I don't trust you. I've already opened a complaint. I hope you arrest him... for life... and that I will never again hear your name! Asshole! Asshole! - Keep buying. - Listen to me. I can't buy for you now. Watch the news. You are in default. Run! They're after you! Buy for yourself or for someone else. I can't buy anything! Henry, don't let me down. You left yourself in the lurch. It's over. The game is over. - We're looking for the Flying Fund. - Top floor, gentlemen. You've reached Sibylle Mahler. Leave a message and I'll call you. as soon as possible. Sibylle, it's me. I'm going to Montreal. I'm stopping everything. Let's go start over, love. Wait for me. Wait for me. Wait for me. PASS CONFIRMATION Yes? We have a search warrant, Open up, please. Open up, please, you're under arrest. Please come back. Hurry up. Back in town. Mr. Kermor, open it now. First London, and now.., New York comes to a stop. Markets around the world are standing still. The negotiations were suspended indefinitely. Wall Street suffered a fall of 20% since the morning... the first time since 1987. With the exception from 9/11... prices have never fallen so fast... since Black Thursday in 1929.
