This program is rated G and is suitable for general audiences. ♪ I see the crystal raindrops fall ♪ ♪ And the beauty of it all ♪ I believe love is defined by two things. First, what we see. Then, what we feel. Dancing was a staple in our house. It was my parents' personal love language. But even more, I could feel the love in everything we did together. ♪ Just the two of us ♪ We can make it if we try ♪ Just the two of us ♪ Just the two of us Our principles were simple. Keep God and family first and everything else will work itself out. My mom was my dad's queen and I was his princess. It was perfect, until it wasn't. As my parents grew in their respective careers, work started to take precedent over family. And I guess we kind of lost balance. ♪ We gotta go... I'll never forget the day my dad moved out. It was the saddest day of my life. ♪ We can make it... They were growing apart and decided divorce was the best option. Once Mema moved in everything changed. I went from a carefree princess to a worrisome daughter, overly concerned with trying to make everyone else happy. As sad as I was, I think I was more hurt seeing my parents become shells of themselves. And now I have my own prince to create my story with. Mm-hmm! Oh! You still got it. I still got it. Someone woke up in a good mood today. Well, this somebody happens to be the luckiest man in the world. Even after five long years of marriage? Even after five long, long... Okay, okay. So, this mood of yours wouldn't have anything to do with a special upcoming date? Upcoming date? Ahh! Our anniversary. I guess you got me. Someone has to bring the excitement, right? Excuse me? Well you tend to be more of the Debbie Downer around this time. Debbie Downer? Really? Okay, okay you're right. But I mean we know why. It's never about us. Well, this year let's be intentional about making it about us. And possibly adding a, you know. I hear you. Really. Starting tonight. Oh. What's oh? I forgot I told Kam that we could host her and her new boyfriend for dinner tonight. Why'd you do that? Sorry. I mean she just really wants you to meet him. Why me? Because only a king could recognize another potential king. I guess, that cheesy line is supposed to work on me? Did it? You're so good to me. I promise after dinner it's just you and me, okay? - Can't wait. - Bye. Oh, so nice of you to join us. Please don't start. I actually had to stop by the store for our date tonight. Oh, my bestie. Uh-uh, now I'm your bestie? Okay, I just need a minute to get my chi together. Well, you better put your chi on pause. Miss Sally's been waiting for you since the doors opened. Oh. Relax. I already did her shampoo and conditioner. Oh, that's why I love you. Mm-hmm. Well, actually I just wanted to tell you more about Rahsaan. Girl, I can't thank you enough. I mean, as soon as you told me he was a lawyer I was interested. Of course. No, but seriously. He is so much more. Alicia, I'm telling you. He's funny, a gentleman. Oh, and what I love the most is that he's not flashy, you know? Girl, I do not need his whole resume. Arnold is the one you need to convince. He wasn't too thrilled about us double dating tonight. Oh, please tell him to be nice. We will not stay long. Oh, I know. Oh, yeah, it's your anniversary coming up. I hope you planned something romantic. Let me get this straight. You think me having a romantic evening with my husband will get him to sign off on your relationship? You make it sound so out of the question. Twist and down. Up and down. Scoop in, up and back two three, like a rubber band. And finish strong. All on the heel. Oh. Looks great. Apologies for interrupting. Not at all. Dr. Roberts, class was actually ending. We were just going over some new moves. Looks really good. Now remember that dancing is bigger than the physical body. When you extend your arm the energy continues past the fingers. Claim the space. Nice work everyone. Those are great thoughts to reflect on. Uh, everyone. You heard those words. Let's bring the action on Thursday. Great job everyone. Thank you. Just wanted to check in, see how our new associate professor is adjusting. Everybody's raving about your work. Oh, that's great to hear. You know, we would love to have you join us for a whole class. Oh, no, no, no. Those days are long gone. Oh, I beg to differ. You are considered an icon in our industry. Well, thank you. You know, I would love to pick your brain over lunch. It doesn't have to be today or anything, but... Yeah. We should have lunch, definitely. We'll talk about choreography and the studio, et cetera. That'd be great. - Nice work. - Thanks. Woah, that looks great on you. Really? I don't know. I think I liked the other one more. It's more comfortable. I could move more in it. Just get both. - Jack, it's not... - No. I insist. Well, if you insist. Yes, Morgan you'll have to reprint all the programs. They are not going out with all those grammatical errors. Okay, thank you. Nobody proofreads anymore. I'm sorry I'm late. You know how hard it is for me to leave campus without running into 20 people who needs something from me. I understand. Hmm. I can't go into my next meeting smelling like tuna. I apologize, I know. It's not your look. I'll make it up to you tonight. I'll come over, I'll make my famous spaghetti. You know how much Arnold loves it. Yeah. That he does. But um, I can't tonight. I'm actually having Kam and her new boyfriend over. Ah. But, I mean, I can cancel if you want. Oh, don't be ridiculous. You sure? I'm fine. Of course, of course, of course. I'll still make the spaghetti. I'll save some for Arnold. And, I mean, Mema still has to eat. Mema probably has a date tonight. You're right. She probably does. But still, it's all right. I'm fine. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Just you and your work. I'm sorry. Mom, don't you think it's time that maybe you got back out there? Where exactly is "there" located? Look, just because I'm alone doesn't mean I'm lonely. And also I have you. What else do I need? - Um. - Go ahead. Okay, really. I will make it up to you next time. It'll just be you and me. No phones, okay? I promise. I love you. Love you. Hi there. Yep, okay. On my way... Well, the good news is I think you got one for every day of the week now. I think you might be right. Yeah. Hey princess. Hey. Oh, I didn't realize you were out. I can try you later if you want. No, no, no. Timing's perfect. Um, I'm actually out with Jada. You want to say hi? Um, no. That's okay, Dad. Hey Alicia. Nice to see you. Hi Jada. Hey, so what's up? Oh, nothing. I just wanted to see if you were free but... We're actually heading to lunch. You want to come with? I can swing by and pick you up. Oh, that's okay. I just ate, but maybe next time? All right. Well, love you. Love you too. Take care. Bye. I mean, most importantly the work is rewarding. Long hours and way too much paperwork? Thankfully I get to see this beautiful face when I'm not working. Oh, isn't he cute? He's doing so much for the community. That's great, man. I wish this web developer could share about how his work is inspiring the world. Don't sell yourself short, boo. The apps that you create help us all stay connected. - It's important work. - Thank you. Do those dating apps really work? I mean, sure. Um, some people seem to find them effective. Different times I guess, huh? Yeah. Can you imagine our parents meeting through a phone app? Well, my parents were destined to fill each other's life with torture, no matter if they met through technology, arranged marriage, or any other dating means. What about your parents? What's that? Oh, they are divorced. I'm sorry to hear. Uh... No, it's fine. It's been years. But, yeah, they would not fare well on those apps. My mom is too busy to search for herself, and my dad... well he doesn't even know what he's searching for. Well, I'm thankful for you pairing us together. That's right. Because lord knows I didn't know what I was doing. Mm-mm. To The Love Doctor. To The Love Doctor. Love Doctor. I'll take it. Thanks for coming. That Rahsaan seemed pretty cool. Bit of a know-it-all, but he's cool. My dad texted earlier that he and Jada agreed to take a break. Which means he broke up with her. Well, you didn't care too much for her anyway, right? She was okay. I mean, it really wasn't about her. He's always finding these women, building them up, and then when things get too serious he just leaves. I'm just so over both of them. I mean, my mom isn't any better. On a positive note it seems like The Love Doctor has scored another one with Kam and Rahsaan. I did, didn't I? Maybe we should get you to design one of our dating apps. Maybe. Anyway, enough about everyone else for the night. I just want to cuddle up. Now that I can get with. That can't be. But we both know it is. Are you sure you don't want some, Arnold? I made plenty. I thought your friends were still going to be here. Oh no, I'm fine. Thank you, Brenda. That is really thoughtful of you, Mom. Yeah. Definitely a surprise. You know, I'm actually about to head to bed, so. Should I go? No, no, no, no, Mom. You're fine. Are you sure? I don't want to stay too long. I don't want to intrude. No. It's cold in here. Are you cold? - Just a little. - Yes. It's chilly. I'll turn it up. Oh, thanks. - Thanks babe. - So nice. He's such a good man. You better take care of him. What is this? Hmm. "Organic Chemistry brings back the concept of courting, "parties involved are truly able to communicate," "taking the time to create a bond while discovering" "the other person both mentally and emotionally." Babe. I think I just solved our problem. Well, in a sense you did. And before you say anything, the solution doesn't even involve me. What are we talking about? Your new dating app, Organic Chemistry. It's perfect for my parents. Wait, what? This seems like a lot. You really think they'd go for it? You just said that your mom thinks she's fine. Besides we designed this app specifically for open-minded people. What are you trying to say? True, she will be a hard sell. But once I convince her that we need our space, then... Like you did tonight? Fair. I probably should've spoken up. But this babe, this is our ticket to freedom. Are you excited? This is good. Hey Dad. Wait, wait, wait, slow down. No. A DM's not an app. It's when you directly message someone. Let me get my "I told you so" out of the way now. No, no, no. So that's what this daughter-daddy time is? You trying to get me to use some new dating service? The apps I'm using are just fine. First of all, you just learned what an app is. And secondly, I brought you here because I love spending time with my dad. And I would argue that your dating life isn't going well. Just saying. What are you talking about? My life is just fine. What, Jada? Mm-hmm. She wanted something I couldn't give her. That's the problem, Dad. I mean, every time things get serious you get cold feet. Here. It's the latest from Arnold's company. Organic Chemistry. It's dedicated to helping people like yourself to take the time to create a bond while discovering the other person both emotionally and mentally first. Why do I feel like I'm listening to an infomercial. Basically, it's not like those other dating sites where you're simply swiping based off of physical appearance. That's what's been steering you wrong, Dad. I'm just trying to help you out. I'm fine. Oh, come on, just give it a try. If you don't like it, I won't bug you again. So, I'm assuming that means if I don't try you're going to keep bugging me until I do. - Every day. - Yeah. ♪ Okay, that's better. I gotta say, I just can't believe I'm taking class with the great Dr. Roberts. You're from Ailey, to Philadanco, to Ronald K. Brown Evidence. I mean, I could go on. It's flattering that you know my resume so much. You've created a great body of work yourself. Well, hopefully under your tutelage it will only continue to grow. Hey Mom. Oh hi. This is a nice surprise. Yeah. Just thought I'd stop by and say hi. - Hi. - Hi. - Hi. - Hi. Mr. Staples, this is my daughter, Alicia. Alicia, this is Mr. Staples. He's our new associate professor. He's bringing some fresh energy into the program. You're too kind. A pleasure to meet you. Likewise. All right. Well, um, thank you again, Dr. Roberts. Looking forward to putting our lesson today into practice. Great. Good work. Ladies. Take care. Okay. What? Oh, nothing. Nothing at all. Now, I know why you've been so busy with work. Oh, please. My relationship with Mr. Staples is completely professional. - -Okay. Dr. - Roberts. Anyway. I know you didn't come here just to say hi. What's up? How rude, but okay. Here. What's this? It's an online dating app from Arnold's company. They developed it. It's- Nope. Hear me out. It's completely legit. I think this could be a good option for you, Mom. Option implies that I'm looking and I'm not. And I get that. But that doesn't mean you're not missing out. Look, I know you love spending time with me and Arnold. I just want you to have the same thing for yourself. Is this your way of telling me that I'm too much of a third wheel? No. No, not at all, Mom. We love your company. It's- Look. I really appreciate your genuine concern, but I am fine. And online dating, it's not my thing. Well, dating is not really your thing, Mom. Yes, there is a stigma with finding someone online, but this site seems genuinely dedicated to helping people make genuine connections. I'm sure it is. But it's a hard no. Look, can you at least browse the app? I don't even know what that means. Come on, I have to go. Promise me then you'll at least find some time for yourself? I can't have you becoming one of the Golden Girls. Thank you. Clearly you can see I'm vertically challenged. Um... Well, you have a good night. Thanks. You too. Thanks. Hey there. I was just about to call you. You need anything while I'm out? No. But I wanted to call you to tell you that The Love Doctor strikes again. Oh boy. What are you talking about? You said my parents wouldn't be on board with the dating app. They actually said yes? Well, my dad is a solid yes. My mom, soft no. But when I ask her tomorrow she'll be in. You know what's not funny is I believe you used that same strategy on me. Maybe. I love you. I love you too. ♪ Hey Mom. Did you want to play another game? Hmm? I had a long day at work so I hope you don't mind eating the leftover spaghetti. - I actually ordered Chinese. - Mmm. That's even better. Are you wearing makeup? - Hi. - Hi. Come on in. Mm. Smells good. We can go upstairs if you want to stay down here. No. Hello Mr. Cornelius. It's nice to see you again. Hi. Yeah. Okay. Gotcha. - Look at this. - No! Take that. Tell Alicia and Arnold I said hi. Excuse me? You're going over to their house, right? I mean, where else would you be going at this hour? - Hit me, hit me, come on. - Oh. I thought I heard something outside. - Put one down. - Come on, give me a shot. Come on now. No, everything's all right. No, you're too lucky. What are you doing? No! Okay, Bren. You're too lucky. I wonder who that could be. Hey Mom. I can't believe what I'm about to ask you. What was the name of that site again? Mom, really? You're going to do it? This is good, this is good. Okay, please calm down. Okay. Um, I will call you tomorrow and we'll walk through it. Okay. You won't regret it, I promise. I don't even want to know. She's going to do it. The Love Doctor strikes again. Okay. I did it. So you want me to put my picture up on this site but I can't see the other person's? Yes Mom. But they can't see you either. It gives you a chance to really open up before the other person's picture starts to unblur. I don't know. Sounds a little strange to me. Dad, trust me. It's safe. Okay, remember. Connect emotionally and then you get to meet them. Think of it this way. It gives you a little more mystique. And women actually like a little mystery, Dad. All right, Mom. How does this sound? An ambitious entrepreneur looking for a dancing partner. I don't know. It sounds a little... A little true. Mom, you can't fool me. I know you're tired of being alone. Okay fine. But also put serious inquiries only. Okay. "Doctor Roberts." All right. So I'm looking for an independent woman that exudes confidence. That all sounds fine and everything but where's the fun? Movies, dancing. Bingo. Dad, you are a retired corporate attorney. You need to start entertaining a serious relationship, not one where you're just paying for everything. All right. All I need now is the name that you want to go by. What do you want the most out of this? I want you to stop bothering me and giving me a headache. Hmm. Sounds like "Finding Peace." Just a good time. Nothing too serious. Laughter's a must. Perfect. "Looking to Laugh" it is. Trust me, The Love Doctor's got this. Oh, come on. The wind took that. You know, I've seen you play in real life, right? What's going on? I'm trying to figure out what to do for our anniversary. Five years in the game and I think it's time that we add to the team. How's Alicia feeling about that? She's so busy playing matchmaker for her folks that her mother might end up having a child before we do. For real. She set them both up on Organic Chemistry. Our site? Uh-huh. Oh, well that's a win, right? The quicker you can get them out of y'all hairs, the quicker you two can get to the game plan. I guess, later. Alright. You know where to find me. Swish. So, is Rahsaan the one? I don't know about all that, but he's definitely the one for right now. Girl, I am not messing with you. You need to be messing with your husband. Starting that again, huh? I'm not starting nothing. You know how you get when you start playing cupid for everyone but yourself. Okay, so what? You're in a relationship for two weeks and suddenly you're a relationship expert? Hmm. And on that note, thanks for closing up. Wait? What? Bye sis. Love you. Love you, too. So, how was your day? It was fine. How about yours? Same. Oh um, Kam said things are heating up between her and Rahsaan. Score one for The Love Doctor. Hmm. And I'm almost done setting up my parents for romance. Wow, make that three. Hey babe, the game's about to start. Do you mind if I... - Yeah, sure. - Yeah? Hey babe. I'm just going to go finish up their profiles real quick, but do you want to cuddle up and watch a movie after? Sure. Yeah, if I'm, if I'm still up. Yeah. Oh, okay. ♪ Everything is plant-based and mostly raw. Oh, so good. M-mom? You're exaggerating okay? It couldn't have been that bad. It was worse. The first date got separation anxiety when I told him to put his phone away. The second date, he needed a job and he was 15 minutes late, and he had the nerve to say that he left his wallet in the car. Are you serious? What did you do? I waited for him to go get it. Well, I mean you can't give up after one or two bad experiences. I mean I will admit the whole experience reminded me of how much I like a little companionship. So maybe I'm open to finding someone again but not like this. All right. I'm going to get some rest. I love you. I love you too. Say hi to Arnold and try to stop by later this week. I will. And sure. Bye. You okay? Go ahead. You know you want to say you were right. What? No, that's not... that's not like me. But I mean, was I right? No? Online dating's for millennials. I just need a good book. Although having someone to laugh with wouldn't be so bad. No, I'm going to cancel this account right now. Oh, my god, you are so funny. Too funny. Finding Peace? I thought I would surprise you. I hope that's okay. Wow. Hi Marcus. Hey. See you later. What? Nothing. It's just really nice. And needed. Which reminds me. What about a log cabin for our anniversary? They say the traditional fifth year gift is wood. Think about it. Just you and I, nestled up in front of a warm fire. Mm. That does sound nice. Mm-hmm. I just know with my schedule it's just hard to get away. I should've thought about that. But you might be onto something. How about we do some sort of staycation? Maybe a room at a fancy hotel? Mm-hmm. Okay. You're not going to believe this, but guess who has a date tonight? Who? Not your mother. Yeah. Well, that's good. You should go call her. You sure? Yes, yeah, please. Before she shows up here. I'm kidding, I'm kidding. But you know how the last few dates turned out. You know what? You're right. I should probably go meet her. Yeah, I'm going to go help. Yeah, that makes sense. I think I might head to happy hour with Marcus anyway. Okay. Sounds good. Just make sure to bring this home with you. I love you. This was great. We'll do more of this. Alicia was a nice surprise. Yeah. It was cool. Definitely unexpected. Sounds like there's a "but" coming. No, it was great. But it's just that the other day I was in the store. Mm-hmm. And this woman, she smiled at me and I don't know... What do you mean? No, no, no. Nothing like that. Look, I guess it just felt good to feel attractive. You know I love my wife. See, the worst phrase a man can start with is "you know I love my wife." Okay, no look. Lately it just feels like we've been going through the motions and the intimacy's been missing. Have you shared this with her? Yeah, yeah. I know, I know. - Look, I always tell you, man. - I gotta communicate. Oh yes. Yes, yes, yes. Wow, Mom. You look amazing. You really think so? Of course. Here, let me take a photo. I feel like it's prom. You do look nice. Thanks. Leaving nothing to the imagination, but... Oh. Mema, she's fine. Still don't know who this mystery man is, though. Well, we decided to reveal our faces in public. We thought it would be fun to just wait and see. So, he's not even coming to pick you up. Nope. I'm meeting him at the restaurant. In my day, a gentleman escorted the lady on their date. In your day, I don't think a gentleman even saw a woman at night unless they were married. Oh! Ooh, I got you. Okay. Just make sure you call me if you need anything. Anything. Just relax. Aren't you the one who encouraged me to get back out there? I'm fine. And thank you. You got this. ♪ ♪ Brenda? Brenda? Jack? What are you doing here? Uh... I mean, this is weird, the two of us, you know. Well, I don't mean like that, I mean. Why am I talking with my hands? Uh, hi. Wow. It's... This is, this is crazy. Look at you. You look stunning. Well, thank you. I, I can't. I can't believe this, um... I know right? It's been a minute. Yeah. What, since Alicia's wedding? Alicia's wedding. That's right. Yeah. Wow. That was a beautiful day. It really was. Hey look. You know, I don't... I don't want to hold you up or anything. I just wanted to come and say hi. Yeah well you know, I don't want to hold you up either. I mean, I assume you're with someone. Yeah, well I mean they're not here yet. But um, I mean you're welcome to have a seat if... Oh, no, no, no. I wouldn't want your lady friend to, you know, look at me sideways. It's not even like that. I'm assuming you're here to meet a gentleman anyway. I am here to meet a gentleman, yes. Well, you know, it was, it was really good seeing you. Yeah. You as well Jack, you as well. Hey Brenda. Look, I don't mean to bug you. I, uh, you did say you were meeting someone here, right? Yeah. They said they're here already. Yeah. Same here. So, this person, you didn't happen to meet them on a dating app, did you? Organic Chemistry. Finding Peace. Oh. No no no no. You're Looking to laugh? Alicia. I told her it was a bad idea this online dating thing. Are you kidding me? We gotta at least give her credit for at least caring. I mean, it's just... Wow. Yeah. Hey, you haven't eaten yet though, right? No, I haven't eaten. Neither have I and uh, well you know, we're both hungry and you look way too nice to waste this dress. So, I've got a table, how about dinner? I... Just dinner. Oh. Hmm? Okay, just dinner. Just dinner. Dinner. ♪ Thank you. How much is my half? Come on, Brenda. You know me well enough to know I won't accept your money. I just want to make it clear that this wasn't a date. Of course. But can't a man show a beautiful woman a little gratitude for a lovely evening? It was a lovely evening and very unexpected. Thank you for dinner, Jack. Yeah, you're welcome. Woah, hey, woah, hold on. ♪ Uh-oh. Oh, come on. Just one for old times' sake. One for old times? Yeah. Just one. ♪ I can't believe you had us battle that other couple. Oh please, you loved it. I did until you started to break out that Soul Train line. Okay, maybe that was a bit much. A bit? Oh, my gosh. You remember when you took me to see this movie? How could I forget? You wouldn't sleep without the lights on. Shh. Oh, my goodness. Brenda! Is that you? Uh, yeah Mom, it's me. I'm just, I got up early to clean. I'll be quiet. I'll be quiet so go back and rest. Get up. Get up. Time to get up. - Hey. Hey, what? - Get up. Can't let Mema see you here. Get up. Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. Can I at least get some coffee? No, you can't get any coffee. You have to go. Let me get your jacket. Millions of people on the internet, only I would reconnect with my ex-husband. Well, the irony is, it wasn't that bad, was it? No, but you don't know me anymore and I don't know you. Okay. But the familiarity is nice. At least it is for me. Yeah, sure. You know you gotta admit. I mean, it's funny how our daughter unknowingly found a way to get us back together. No, we're not back together and she can't know about this, okay? Brenda, I didn't mean it like that. Of course, my lips are sealed. I'm not going to say anything. Okay. Let me uh, sneak out before your mother catches me in my old house. It's nice to see you. ♪ Morning beautiful. Hey. Do you know, I called my mom about four times last night and she's yet to return my call? Your mother's grown. She probably stayed out later than she's used to and she's simply recovering. She hasn't been out in years. True I guess. Did you speak with Mema? Mema? No. No, I didn't want it to seem like I was checking up on her. Which you are. Haha. What about Jack? What's the latest with him? Well, um, he's been quiet too. But, um, we're meeting up for a walk in the park so we'll see. You know, that would actually be nice for us to do sometime. I... I know. - Goodbye. - Love you. Come on, come on. I got good energy today. I'm sure. It must be all that hanging out in these streets that's giving you life. The streets? My, have times changed, huh? Exactly. Because now you're acting more like the teenager. What are you laughing at? Who's the parent now? I'm just saying Dad, it's irresponsible not to return my call. What, I told you I had a date. Which you still haven't said anything about. I mean anything could've happened. I was worried, Dad. Okay, okay, okay, okay. All right, look. You're right. I'm sorry. I apologize, okay? I should've called and let you know I was fine. Okay, well thank you. But from the looks of it seems like you had a good date. Yeah. I did. So? So uh, it was great. She was great. Okay, it feels like I'm pulling teeth here. What did you guys do? What does she look like? What is her name? Give me something. She's beautiful, we ate, we danced, we had a great time. Aw, look at you. So when's the next date? You know, I don't know. We, uh, I think we both decided that maybe there won't be a next date. What? I'm confused. She's still trying to get over an ex. I see. Well just give it time. I mean, you know you have a habit of being affectionately overbearing. Just let her know that you'll wait as long as she needs. You can still take it slow and get to know someone, right? Okay. Come on Miss Advice. Okay, okay take it slow on the way back, okay? Come on. I can't really keep up with you anymore. Come in. Hey. Jack, what are you doing here? I see some things haven't changed. Still burning the midnight oil, huh? Well, it's not exactly midnight. Yeah, well it's not quite office hours either. May I? Um... Just, just, just hear me out. Hold on. This morning when you said that, you know, we don't know each other. At first it bothered me but, you know, I started thinking about it and you're right. You're absolutely right. We don't know each other. I mean, I've certainly changed since we were together and I'm assuming you have as well. Yes, I have. So, I was thinking, um, why don't we, I don't know, spend some time relearning each other? Relearning each other? Okay, I don't even know what that means. Uh, last night really was great. I'm just, I'm not interested. Oh. Sorry, Doctor Roberts. Do you have a minute? Yeah sure, of course. Just hoping you could sign-off on this formation before I head out. Yeah. No problem. - It looks great. - Yeah. Yeah, terrific. - I'm pretty happy with that. - Great. Okay, I'll let you get back to your meeting. - Okay. Goodnight. - Goodnight. You know, you could've introduced us. Yes, I could have. So, is that the reason why you don't want to hear me out? No. Well, he's a colleague and that's none of your business. Okay. You're right. You know what, back to us. See but there is no "us" is the whole point, right? Why do you want to meet so badly? I don't know. I just, I think there's a lot of things we haven't spoken about. Well, because we haven't spoken for a long time. Do you want closure or something? No, no. I wouldn't call it closure. A check-in? Look, last night was fun. It was great. It was special. A moment is all I'm asking. Oh come on. I mean is it wrong for two people that's familiar with each other to share a moment? It's not that simple. Well, it could be. Let's, let's just go out as friends. As friends? Friends, yeah. Acquaintances. Whatever you want to call it. We'll keep it simple. You know, knowing the two of us I'll probably get on your nerves before tomorrow anyway. So, this will all be irrelevant. It is probably true. As friends. That's it. All right. Cool. Okay friend. All right. I'll call you. Okay. ♪ ♪ It's me ♪ Then it's you ♪ Completely take my mind and renew ♪ ♪ Renew ♪ So amazing I can't let you go away ♪ ♪ Every time I move ♪ You pull my heartstrings to stay ♪ ♪ When I wake in the morning ♪ it's you ♪ I lay down at night ♪ it's you ♪ My heart opens like a door to you ♪ ♪ It's you ♪ When I close my eyes ♪ it's you ♪ When I pray to God ♪ it's you ♪ My love ♪ It's you ♪ Heartbeat right here next to mine ♪ ♪ It feels so right ♪ I don't know a love of this kind ♪ 31. I'm talking about that look on your face. Clearly this new friend of yours has left an impression. You can brush me off if you want. But I know that look. Shoot, I invented that look. Your father, God rest his soul, would keep me smiling just like that even when we weren't in the same room together. Actually, I haven't seen you smile this much since... I'm happy for you. Just take it easy. Your heart is fragile. Always has been. And make sure whoever he is is aware of that. Okay. ♪ You haven't asked me to cover your shifts. Make any reservations? What's up? I think we're going to keep it simple. Arnold mentioned something about going to a cabin over the weekend. Whatever you decide you might want to leave your phone at home over the weekend. Don't think I haven't noticed you checking your phone all morning. Your mom's going to call you when she's ready. It's just so not like her. You know she cancelled our weekly lunch date? Just relax, crazy. I'm sure Arnold would love to enjoy his wife without parental interruptions for once. Okay. Easy big guy. Looks like someone needed to relieve some stress. What's up? My wife seems more interested in her parents' love life than planning our family. Your parents have been honeymooning since you've been born. Alicia's broke up, what, when she was 12 or 13? What's that got to do with it? As another divorce child I can tell you, that wound doesn't heal quickly. Give her some grace. And again, let her know how you feel. If you tell her you want a child and she doesn't, well that's a different issue. But at least you know where she stands instead of trying to guess. Let's get back to it, man. All right. Nice of you to check in on me. And as for your mother, she's been running around here with her head in the clouds. Yeah. Seems like this guy's really got her going, huh? Mmmhmm. Have you met him? No. She insists it's not serious enough to bring him around. She just left here not too long ago, said they were headed out to Selena's. I just told her not to have her fancy tail out all night running in the streets. Anyway, how's that husband of yours? He's doing good. Actually, I need to go home to meet him now. All right, well, I won't hold you up. And finish that tea before you head out. Yes, ma'am. And listen... I know how much you care about your mother and your father. Ever since their divorce you've been working to put the pieces of the puzzle back together. But you have to realize that's their puzzle. Your joy lies in you. Piecing together your own journey. ♪ Hey there. I thought we could start this anniversary a little early. Aww, I wish I had known. I actually made us reservations at Selena's tonight. Oh. I should've called. How about we go there and we can save this amazing meal you planned for tomorrow night? Selena's on a weekday, huh? Doesn't even sound like you. Okay. As you know, my mom has been short with me all week. Of course. I should've known it had something to do with one of your parents. Look, hear me out. So, I go to Mema's house to look for her and she's not there. So, Mema tells me that she and this guy are going to Selena's tonight. So, you spent all day worrying about your mom, but now you want me to join in? I mean, not just for that. I figured we could... - A romantic stakeout. - Exactly. Sounds fun, right? No, I'm going to pass. Oh, come on. We can eat and catch them in the act. Win-win. For who? See, I don't get why you're so obsessed with what your mom or your dad are doing. As long as they're happy, what's the issue? Well, I knew you were going to say that. Maybe Kam will come with me. I'm not going to be gone that long, I promise. Look, I hope you find whatever it is you're actually looking for. Babe. Remember when you froze in the middle of your speech at your company reception? Oh, yeah. And you had to get up and finish my thank yous. Mm-hmm. I've always hated public speaking and you're so good at it. Always walking on the outside. You're such a gentleman. You know it used to frustrate me when you'd be mad at me and wouldn't let me walk on the outside lane. It drove me crazy. I know. Woah, woah. - What? What's the matter? - We can't go in there. Why not? Look. Alicia and Kam. Oh, no, no. We can't go in there. Okay. Don't worry, I got a backup plan. Okay. Why do I feel this was your plan all along? Of course, it was. I staged Alicia catching us going out to dinner together. Do not give me that much credit. Speaking of which, what have you told her about the person you're seeing? Mm. Just that she's the most amazing woman in the world. I'm serious. I've been trying really hard to avoid her. I just, I don't know what to say. I mean, we can't tell her about this. She'd be devastated. What, that her parents are back together? Back together? I'm... Brenda. You know what I meant. Jack. This last week has been great fun. Let's just call it what it is. It's a fling. A fling? I wouldn't say that. Well, outside of the laughs and the romance, what have we actually discussed? Signing those divorce papers, that was the worst day of my life. And sure we've been cordial all these years for Alicia's sake, but we never even checked in on each other. And for years I was questioning myself. What could I have done differently? What could you have done differently? I didn't even date. I wasn't even interested in a man in that way. Then just as I'm about to give love another shot you magically appear and... Okay. So, is that a bad thing? I don't know. I'm confused. What happened to us? Brenda, we were young. You know, we were both trying to make a name for ourselves in our respective fields and somehow I think we just lost a sense of our priorities and started putting work first. And then. you know, I started having these weird feelings like the more I tried to protect you the less receptive you were. Well, see that's the whole thing, Jack. Protect me from what? I was looking for a partner. I didn't need another father. It was like... it was like you didn't want me to grow or something. No, no, no. That wasn't it at all. I just... I stopped knowing how to make you happy. And then I didn't feel needed. You know, at some point I didn't even know where my place was in your busy life. Your place was right by my side. Championing me. Just like I would you. Right, right, right. I get that now. No, but you can't get that now because we're just now talking about it. I don't know. I just know that I don't want to live in a bubble knowing that it will eventually burst. I'm going to go. I need to go home. Brenda. No I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Brenda. Brenda. Hey. I um, special ordered you some breakfast from Selena's last night. It's just in the microwave if you want to heat it up. Thanks. But keeping it light this morning. Got a late night so I'm going to grab something on the way home from work. There's leftovers from last night if you want that later. Look. I'm sorry about last night. Did you catch your mother? No, no. She wasn't there. I shouldn't have gone. Arnold. What, Alicia? I know we need to talk, so can you just please say what you're thinking? What I'm thinking. I don't know, to be honest with you. You don't get it. I mean, your parents are different... Yeah. My parents have been together for 40 years now. Thank God. And I couldn't imagine either of them without each other. Which is why I've tried to be so patient and understanding. But it feels like if we aren't discussing your parents in some capacity then we aren't even speaking. So, uh, last night after enjoying my exquisite meal alone I decided that maybe I'm... maybe I've been doing too much. And maybe, maybe we're not ready. Uh, ready for what? Exactly. I'll see you later. Mr. MIA. Hey. So, okay. I know it feels like I've been ducking you lately, but it's not that at all. Just hear me out. I'm listening. So, the uh, the reason I've been so reluctant to introduce you to the woman that I'm seeing is, well, you know, how you always get on me about ending relationships the minute they get serious? I didn't want to, I didn't want to go through that. So, that's why you've been running around in secret? That and I'm trying something new like you said. I just don't want to disappoint you or myself anymore. You know? That means a lot, Dad. But I am still your daughter. I mean, you can't block me out completely. We were always honest with each other, all right? Even, even the boyfriends you didn't like, I still let you meet them. Yeah. So um... About the woman that I'm seeing, she's... Dad. No, no pressure. You know, honestly you coming here today and just opening out about why you've been so secretive, it's... it's refreshing honestly. You know I never told you this but I... I actually signed up, Mom on that dating site too and she's been just as tight-lipped as you. And now it all makes sense. It does? Yeah. When you and Mom got divorced I was hurt. I was... I was devastated. And I blamed you, blamed her, blamed myself. And I prayed every night that you two would somehow find your way back to each other again. And when that didn't happen I prayed that you'd at least both find love again. I think I just, I think I just need to back off. So, when you are ready to share this mystery woman with me then I will be here. Until then if she is as special as you say she is, then she's the one you should be sharing that with. Come on. Okay. Just keep it short and simple. Just tell her how you feel? ♪ Oh! You got the beat. Really Brenda? I apologize. No. There's nothing to apologize for. Jack. What is the matter with you? Are you seriously mad right now? Look. Maybe I overreacted. I just, it just looked like- Looked like what? I'm at work. Well, I thought I was interrupting something. There's nothing for you to interrupt. I... you know what? I don't want to defend myself over nothing. What does that mean? It means that you're parading around here like I owe you something. What are you talking about? I never said that. You don't have to say it. Your actions say it. Jack, our long walks and cooking together and all the stuff we used to do, it's been fun, but we know this routine. What are we really doing? I don't know, Brenda. Maybe dating. Maybe trying to rediscover what we had. It's hard for me to casually date someone it took me years to get over. And rediscovering? We had 20 years to do that. The only reason we're together now is by accident. Are you saying this whole thing is an accident? No. I didn't mean it to sound like that. That's not what I meant. I just, I... Maybe it's best that we just both move on. Gotcha. Yeah. I wish the best for you. Up. But since tomorrow's our anniversary I went ahead and I booked us a room for the night. It's last minute but apparently it's one of those couple getaway retreats. Kam already agreed to take all my late appointments so I should be done early. You hate it. No. I don't hate it, Alicia. I um... I'm just losing faith. And uh, I want to believe you. But, I guess, I guess we'll see. I get that. And you will see. For now just find an excuse to call out of work and we can start packing. This is going to be a good thing for us, babe. Oh. Answer it. I won't be long, okay? Hey Mom. What, what? Slow down. What? I... I can um, I can try. I can try and make it. Everything okay? Um, no. Actually, my mom and her guy friend, they called it off. Go take care of your mother. What? No, no babe. We just said this weekend is about us. And it is. This weekend it's you and me. But we both know realistically you can't be fully with me if your mother's suffering so. It's okay. Okay. Um, I won't be long, I promise. For now maybe just start packing and I will give you a call as soon as I'm on my way back. I love you. Oh. Look at all those flavors. Do you know what you're going to have? I'm good with cream and sugar. I mean you can keep all those lattes and fraps or whatever else you call them. Hey. You okay? You seem a little off. No, no, no. I'm fine. I'm just, I just got a lot on my mind, that's all. Well, hopefully I'm helping. Relationships are such a headache. Now, I remember why I stayed single for so long. Well, it's been a minute since you've been in the game, but it hasn't changed much. Well, it's your fault I'm dating. That's why it's my treat. Dad. Princess. Brenda. Um, what are you guys doing here? Oh, this is awkward. I know it's been a while but you two can still speak, right? Hi Jack. It's nice to see you. Um, listen, I uh... Alicia. Hi. So Jada is the mystery woman? I'm the what? Mom, you okay? - I gotta go. - Mom? Brenda, I can explain. Explain what? I'm... I'm confused, Dad. Dad? Are you serious? I was going to tell you and I... But you didn't. Jack, what is going on? Um, Jada look. I'm sorry. This, this was a mistake. I'm so sorry. You should've seen the look on her face. She was devastated. And he was just standing there looking silly. We don't have to force tomorrow. I know your mom's... About that. Remember how you said that you knew that I wouldn't be able to focus on us knowing that my mom's going through something? Uh-huh. Well, I kind of invited her. Alicia. Did you seriously invite your mom on our romantic getaway? Uh, it sounds bad when you say it out loud, but yes. She'll have her own room. It's not like she'll be with us. Arnold, she was so sad. If you'd seen her... Okay. Fine. I... I'll just tell her that she can't come. You don't have anything to say? Actually, I don't. Nothing other than what I've already been saying. Is it cool that your mom is joining us on our trip? Of course it's not. But last thing she needs is another man rejecting her so. Well, you should probably get that. We both know it's for you. Did I come at a bad time? Can we please cut the point of small talk? You were seeing Mom this whole time without telling me just to go back to Jada. No. No. That's not what happened, at all. Your mother actually rejected me. Jada just happened to call at the right time and... It was a mistake. You know I saw your mother with a guy from work and you know, after she turned me down... Guy from work. Professor Staples? I don't know what you saw or thought you saw. But I can promise you right now Mom is not thinking about him. Regardless, how... How do you two run around behind my back? Look, we just decided to keep it a secret at least until we knew what we were doing. And then when you and I met up and you told me how the divorce affected you I didn't know how to tell you. Neither one of us did. Princess, the last thing we wanted to do was hurt you. As bad as I feel you have to understand, your mother and I, we're grown. Yeah. We're going to make mistakes. But that's for us to figure out. Just like I have no right being all up in you and Arnold's business. And I'm sorry you got involved in this mess. The truth is I still love your mother very much. As crazy as it might sound, losing her this time around just made me realize how much I've been missing her all along. As usual my overbearing ways backfired and, I guess, I came on too strong for your mother. You know, leave it up to me to get in my own way. Always trying to control things that I should just leave to the universe. You have to know when to lead and... and when to follow. Yeah. I guess you're right. Dad. Please don't reach out to Mom if you're not serious. I gotta go finish packing. You can let yourself out. Once again we're so honored to be hosting you all. This resort is truly about lovers. Or those simply looking to disconnect from the world for a while, to give that system a recharge. So, who's ready to take a look? Who brought the stuffed animals to the party? Okay, let's go in. Here you two go. So nice, right? Wow. It's beautiful. I agree. Please look around. I can take you to your room. Yeah. Oh, don't forget about the banquet dinner tonight in the guest hall. It will be free food and music. You'll love the décor. Sounds good. Thank you. This way. Okay. I don't want to do this. You were right. Spending our anniversary with my mom is not cool. Regardless of the circumstances I shouldn't have brought her here. Alicia, it's bigger than that. I know. Do you? Because every time you say that your actions don't seem to match. I know I keep doing the same thing over and over again. It's like I can't stop. And I get it, I'm unintentionally pushing you away. It's working. You asked me why I've been obsessed with my parents' happiness and it finally hit me. I'm scared. Scared of what? Living my own life. After I spoke to my dad I realized that I've been trying to control everything. Even the things that I can't control. And trying to solve their issues because I figured well, if I can find a way to keep them happy then maybe our life could have that fairy tale ending that theirs didn't. And now I'm spiraling and I'm turning our marriage into this self-fulfilling prophecy that could end in us one day becoming strangers. And I can't lose you. I can't. This is the closest that I have felt to you in I don't even know how long. I miss us. I miss our intimacy. There's so much that I want for us. Like growing our family? I know. You've dropped your fair share of subtle hints. I see. I want kids too. I just, I have these flashbacks of when my parents split, and it was just like watching a mountain crumble. And I don't want that for our child. What if that's us? What if it's not? Where you see doubt, I see hope. I've never doubted us because I see the way that my dad still looks at my mom to this day. Yet I realize that that's their story. We are the authors of our own story. And I look forward to writing each and every chapter with you. All I ask is in our book, we play the main characters. Okay, Alicia? I need my wife. For me. For me, babe. Hi. Hi. Wow, this is nice. It's exactly the same as your room. I just, I don't know if this was such a good idea. Are you kidding me? This was a terrible idea. It was a terrible idea. So bad. I'm so sorry I didn't tell you about me and your father. Mom. You've apologized enough. Look, I get it. You two are grown and you didn't want me to get involved. Which you did anyway. But that's fine. I was trying to protect you. I didn't need protection. Yeah. I understand that more than you know. I didn't even realize I still cared until I saw him with that other woman. It didn't feel good, huh? Nope. Not at all. Well, maybe there's still something there for you two to work out. Hmm. Been there done that. You know, not that you care, but I spoke to Dad and he told me that Jada didn't mean anything to him. That he was hurt and confused when you rejected him. No, but I didn't reject... Wait, he said that? Nope. Not going to do it. Not this time. I am staying out. I'm not getting involved. Learned my lesson. Anyway, what are you wearing tonight? I'm wearing my pajamas. And I have a good book. No. No, no, no. No, that's not what's happening. You're coming downstairs. You're going to have dinner with us and there'll be dancing. Enjoy that. Maybe. Maybe. Sounds like a yes. No, no. It's a maybe. Wear your best dress. I'll see you downstairs. Love you! Come on, more dancing.

Is that such a bad thing? If you can't keep it going. That's fair. So look, first of all I wanted to apologize for what happened at the coffee shop. It wasn't what you thought, okay? I know it's cliché to say that you don't know what you've got until it's gone, but it's true. You said we reconnected by accident and you're right, we did. But that doesn't make what I feel any less valid. I want to be clear, I didn't come here to romance you for the weekend. I want this for a lifetime. Well, what would be different this time around? I mean the, the time that we've spent together is showing how much we've grown. Think about it. You weren't always checking in at work and I even let you pay. Well, once. You know Brenda, I never wanted that divorce. In my mind it was always going to work itself out but it took me this time around to realize that it can't work itself out if you stop working. You're absolutely right about that. Well, the beauty is we have now. Yeah. Most people don't get a second chance at their first love. And you were and are my only. Look, I'll be the first to admit I can be a lot. But you gotta understand that you pulling away, it didn't help either. I do understand that. I should've told you how I felt and I'm sorry. It's, you know, most important thing is we're here now and we're talking. And I mean I'm ready to tell you and the whole world how I feel about you. Please. What? You don't believe me?

She reconnected us after years of separation. The thing I learned in that time apart is that true love always finds its way home. You know Brenda, in rediscovering us I found myself. Marrying you was the best decision I ever made. Somehow, I allowed myself to lose you was the worst error ever. You were growing and I didn't know how to handle it. But I'm learning. And I uh, excuse me... I will never dim your light again. In fact, I promise to support and encourage you every step along the way as we grow together. You asked me what I wanted the night that we reconnected on our first date. I just want to be what you need. You know? A partner in this work. Companion on this journey.
