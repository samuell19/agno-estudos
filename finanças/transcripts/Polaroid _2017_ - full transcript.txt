Hey, I found something. It's my mom's old stuff. Oh, looks like love letters. Well, what is that? It's a camera. Look, your mom. I've never seen that one before, looks like just before she died. Maybe it's from the camera, where did you get it? City auction. Ah, cool. She liked that kind of stuff. Um, Craig just liked my picture. Sorry, I told you to take one of your own. It's only lingerie, Sarah. He's more on the beach. Well then, let's take one. For real? But I want it to be special. One of a kind, something only he'll have a copy of. Okay, what've you had in mind? We take it, with this. Are you ready? Is it broken? No, it just takes awhile. Uh, I gotta jet. You look good. Thanks. Linda. Is there anybody there? Hello? Linda, this isn't funny. Zeno, smile. Hey.

You do realize, I only work in here 'cause no one ever comes in right? And 'cause my uncle gives you a discount. Um ... you fixed that yet? No, not yet. Well, anyway thanks for covering for me. I got you something from a yard sale I just hit. Really? / Yeah. Thanks. What is it? Oh my God! It's an SX-70. Oh shit. You like it? Tyler, where did you find this? Seriously, I've never seen one of these before in real life. They don't even make them anymore, they made them for like a couple of years in the 70s. Wow. / This is the same camera Angel Adam Walker Evans used. Whoa, they're ... Photographer. / Right. Oh, yeah. And uh. Anyway, it comes with a film. And there is a camera case for it. / This is so cool. If you wanna make sure it works, there's still a photo in there. Oh yeah! You want me to take your picture? No, thank you, once is quite enough for today. Well, you can try it out on me then. Okay. / Alright... / Yes, stand against the thing. Yeah, that's fine. / Alright. Okay, great. 1, 2. smile. Did it work? I don't know. Whoa. What are you doing? I'm sorry, I didn't ... No, no, you know what. No, it's fine, I need to get going anyway. Okay, I'll see you later. Oh, Bird, hey, you forgot the... case. Hey. Hey. Are you going to work right now? Yeah, I picked up another shift. Mom.. / Oh, you know I have to. Make yourself useful please, help me find my keys. Oh... Every day. Right where they always are. Thank you. It's not always gonna be this way. Okay. / I love you. Alright, I love you. Oh, it's okay, boy. Look. It's just a camera. Hey boy, you wanna take a picture? Ned. Ned. Hey. Jesus. Don't you ever knock? Front door was open. You should've seen your face though. Neddy, hi. Aw, who's a good boy? / Hey, Ned. Ned, will you not make Bird get out of the house tonight? Don't drag him into this. We'll discuss it later. Come on boy, come on. Good boy. So how's your mom? Still not talking to me. So that's awesome. Really? Yes, she told me her brother is praying on it. Like that's gonna fix me. Well I'm sorry, that sucks. Hey, at least on the bright side, only a year and a half until college. Yup. You're still going away for it? / Yeah, definitely. Have you changed your mind? / No. Still doing journalism at county like my dad. So... you coming to the party tonight, or what? I don't know. Come on, it's a week night. And isn't it a costume thing? Yeah, cause Avery missed Halloween when she was in Belize. Oh... / Come on! Please? Besides, Connor will be there. You know I don't wanna scandalize you, but I saw him in speedo at Swim Meet last week. 8 plus. Oh my God. You don't even like guys. / Hey, a good butt's a good butt. Well, now all I'm thinking about is his butt. / Uh, huh. As you should be. You know you like it. Did you know people at school are calling me Scarf Girl? Maybe? See, that's why you should come tonight. Let people actually get to know you. Look, I don't even have anything to wear. No, I figured you would be well, so I bought you something. Um... Ugh, Red Riding Hood? / What? Oh, come on. Isn't she kind of lame? She gets captured by a wolf, and has to be saved by a woodcutter? Okay. Well, if you can put together a better costume in 20 minutes, do it, because that's when our ride's gonna be here. To be continued. Hey. Hey. / Hey. Wow, that's a pretty realistic looking Bird costume. Who's actually behind there? We all know the real Bird doesn't leave her house. Hey, I come out sometimes. Hmm, your job doesn't really count. Are we ready? / Uh, uh, uh. Not in the car. My dad will sniff that shit out. He don't get home 'til Monday. / Yeah, when he'll probably sniff it out. Wait. Are you two fighting again? Oh my God. / He forgot our anniversary. Which she didn't remind me. / It's not my job to remind you. You're my lady. Just come here. Um ... Well, you still can't smoke in my car. Bae, come on. / No / Hey, you know what I heard? Barely, bae means poop in Danish. What? / We can't take you anywhere. Drive, poop. Do not call me poop. Are you kidding? That is not gonna be a thing. No. Why are you laughing, it's not funny. / It's funny. It's not. / Yes. / Then don't laugh. Don't smile. I'm not laughing. I'm not smiling. No. No. No. Yes. That counts, that counts. No .. Alright, are you guys ready? / Yeah. Party! Hit it! Ahh. It's abominable. Cute. Hmm. what the.. We're here! This is so cool. Are you good? Yeah. This is... gonna be great. Come on. Avery! Mins! Hi. You guys look great. Um, everybody get in. Pics or it didn't happen. / Oh my gosh, okay. Hey. Girl, what are you dressed as? A sexy fortune teller. Come on. Move. Everyone who comes in gets a card. For you two, the lovers. Kasey, you get this one. The Fool? / It's perfect, right? / Yeah. And you... just pick one. Yeah. Yeah, that's not good. / Can I try again? Not really how it works. Hey Becky Jay. Oh my God. Stop obsessing and just get a drink. I'm not really in the mood. Whatever, just promise me you're not gonna hang out alone in a dark corner like a weirdo. Of course not. Oh my God! Hey. So how did the photo turn out? What? That was you, right? The one behind the camera. Taking my picture. Oh. No, I wasn't taking your picture. I just, doing this like, um ... camera-test thing? / Oh, so you weren't taking my picture? Oh. No. That'd be weird. Yeah, I bet. Um ... Hey, come on. Take a sit. I'm Connor. / I know. I mean, hi, I'm Bird. Bird? / Hmm .. Nice name, Bird. Uh, thanks. Dad gets all the credit. Said I look like a little Cornish game hen when I was born. what's that? Oh, this? This is called an SX-70. Is that a camera? Yeah, kind of old. I'm not used to seeing people carrying this thing around. Where'd you get it? I ... I work at this antique store. Really? Wow. Didn't know anyone under 80 did that. I'm actually 82. I just look amazing for my age. Something kinda cool about it? / Yeah. Like, the only person in the world who gets to have these images. Hey! / Ooh, what is going on over here? Do you guys know what tonight is? / No. / Do you? Tonight marks my one year anniversary with this lovely lady. Oh... / D? Good photo. Come on. / Yes, yes. Come on, Riding Hood. Don't be shy. Wait, no. You have to ... You're framing it weird. No, down. Babe, weird angle, no. / Bird, ov er here. No, no ... / Wait, guys. I can take it. With this. Uh, someone shops at Urban Outfitters. Here we go. Okay. / Wait, don't you wanna get in it with us? Oh, no, I'm, uh... much better behind the camera. Okay. / All right. Howl on 5, okay. 5, 4, 3. 2. / Photo bomb. / Ouuuu. It's pretty good. Except for Kasey's big-ass head in the foreground. Shut up. Is that what I look like? / Yes, pretty much. I really need another drink. / Let's do that. You guys have fun together. We're alive! Hey, you should jump in the next one with us. So you guys taking photos without me? Oh. Hey, Avery. How does this thing even work? It's like a tiny-ass accordian. Oh yes, there's like a little red button you have to press. It's blank. Yeah. Well it takes a minute for the film to develop. Oh shit, it's the police. Ugh, you gotta be're kidding me. Bird, get down here! I'm Sheriff Pembroke. Why am I here, is my mom okay? / Your mom's fine. She's on her way. Okay. Well then, what's going on? You work with Tyler Drill at the antique shop on Darby Street, right? Yeah, I work with him. Why? / When was the last time you saw him? Around 6, when I left the store. I'm sorry to have to tell you this, but uh... Tyler's dead. What? No, I was just with him. He was fine. Was he having any problem? Is there anyone, anybody who might wanna hurt him? No. No, is that what happened? / What about the last time you saw him? Did he seem, nervous? Ecstatic? No, he seemed normal. Okay. If you remember anything, give me a call. Fitcher. You're Dan Fitcher's daughter? Um... yeah. I was at the scene the night of the accident. You were a very brave girl. Birdie, it's freezing out here honey. You're gonna catch a cold. Do you want to talk about it? No. Maybe, I don't know. It just doesn't seem fair. I know. I know. Why would someone do this? The party's over. Love you all, but get the hell out. Go, go! Animals. Hello? Hello? Birdie, are you sure you really wanna go to school today? I could stay home with you. No. It's fine. Well, you think about it, alright? Hey, Kasey. What's up? You're never gonna believe this. Avery fell down her basement stairs. She's dead. / What? And they think it was an accident. I mean, how does this just happened? I'll call you back. Bird. Hey. Hey. Yeah, this shit is crazy. I heard her parents came over and found her at the bottom of the basement steps, like, head completely turned around full on, exorcist style. Oh God! What? How is this even possible? I mean two people we know in one day. It doesn't make any sense. I mean, Avery wasn't even that drunk. How would she fall like that? What if she didn't? What if something happened to her? Look. See that thing. In the group photo. The smudge? It's not a smudge, this is... / Looks like a smudge to me. Guys. This shadow. I saw the exact one, last night before the party in Tyler's photo. What are you talking about? I took a photo of him. With this. Right before he died. And that shadow was in the picture? Wait, what? I don't see shadows. No, that's exactly my point. After Tyler died, the shadow moved to Avery's photo. And when Avery died, it moved again. I think you're all in danger. Come on, Bird. You should submit that shit to Creepypasta. I think if it takes your photo, you die. First Tyler, now Avery. That means next is one of you. I don't know, maybe all of you. It's not even a very good photo. / It's not a magic camera, Bird. I mean, if it really freaks you out, we can get rid of the damn thing. Devin. / Wait, don't. / Devin. / It's a stupid photo. Problem solved. Guys? What the.. It's not working! / Keep going! It's not working! Oh shit... This is so messed up. I mean, how are we linked to a picture? How is it even possible? I don't know. What do you mean you don't know? This is your camera. Yeah. It's not like this is in the instruction manual, Devin. Let me see this thing. / No, no, no. No one touches it until we figure out what's going on. Right. - Excuse me, your girlfriend's out of surgery now if you'd like to see her. Yeah. Okay. / And miss? Don't go far, someone's gonna come here for you in a few. Take a look at the scuff. Figure this out, Bird. Fix it. Where did you even get this? I don't know. Tyler brought it in yesterday from some yard sale. Did it come in, like a box or anything? / No. Just film and a case. / Well, where's the case? Are you sure you wanna do this? I mean, if you want, I can go. No, it's okay. You're in the photo. You should stay here. Who says the car is any safer? Well, look. If the police come, it's better that you're not in there. Okay, just.. Uh, call me if you see anything weird alright? We're way past weird. Hey. Even though you're not in the photo, be careful. Oh my God, Tyler. I got you, come on. Come on! / Alright, come on, let's go! Get in the car. Hurry! Are you okay? Connor, there was something in there. What? / I don't know. Why is it coming after me? Because you're in it. what? / Look in the reflection. You're in it. Hey. I'll talk to your parents, they're gonna fly back tonight. Happy anniversarry. I love you so much. I love you too. I'll go get the nurse. Be right back. Hello? Connor? / Mina! Listen to me, you guys are in danger, okay? Something just attacked me in the antique store, and it might come for you. Just don't be by yourself. Hello? Shit! Hello! What are you doing over there? Just talked to the nurse, she said she'll be back.. I'm telling you. She didn't kill herself. Okay? Look.. / You're not listening to me. Try to relax. what? / I'll see what I can find out and I'll be back in a couple of minutes. I'm so, so sorry.. / Save it. You did this. She's dead because of you! / Devin. Stop, it's not her fault. Isn't it? Who got the camera? Who took the photo? Huh? Sorry. Are you okay? No. He was at the moment, he didn't mean any of it. / No, he's right. He's right, it is my fault. This all is my fault. what do you mean? My dad. He was a reporter. For the town paper. Anyway, this one night when I was 12 he was driving me to a friend's house for a sleepover. And we get about a halfway there, and he says he wants to take a detour, to show me something he was working on. But I just want to get to the party. I told him I didn't care. So he turned the card around, and.. that's when we got hit. It's my fault. It's always my fault. / I'm so sorry. No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I bet if he were here right now, he'd tell you that this wasn't yoxur fault. No. No, if he were here right now, he'll be trying to figure out why. Grab anything between October to December 1974. Got it. Oh my God! 1974, three kids were abducted and murdered at Locust Harbor. Roland Joseph Sable, the man responsible for the abduction and slaughter of three teens was a photography teacher, at Locust Harbor High. Roland Joseph Sable. R. J. S. This was his camera. And this is what he used it for. He took their pictures. The suspect, Roland Joseph Sable was shot and killed before he could be taken into custody. This is so messed up. I mean, we shouldn't have to die because we took a stupid picture. Now I wanna know how you got away from it and Mina didn't? I don't know, Devin. Now would you sit down so we could figure this out? Okay, so... When it was coming after me, it got onto something hot. And it did this like, weird blurry thing. Blurry thing? What, what do you mean? When you develop photos, you have to be careful, because heat and light can mess up the images. What does that even mean? / Maybe this thing behaves just like a photograph does. Maybe it only develops in the dark. That's why it's not here now. Look, we can't just wait for this thing to kill us off. Okay? Anyone of us could be next. / Okay. Look, I found this guys. Haunted photos. Cameras capturing ghosts. I mean, this stuff is real. Yeah, but how is a shadow in a photo coming after us? / Cursed objects. Sometimes, things absorb energy from their owners, and with ghosts, it's always that they have unfinished business. Look, this is his house. Maybe someone named Sable still lives there. / Here, let me check. It says the house is owned by an Anne Faraday as of 1977. We're wasting time. Okay? And if we don't figure something out, that thing's gonna come back... / Hey, we don't know how this thing works. I say we find out. Devin, put the camera down. / Stop. Stop. / Let go. It was an accident. Guys. / What? / It's moving. It changed the order. Devin, hey, hey, hey. Come on. / I'm not gonna be next. / Davin, stop. Stop, put it down. / This is her fault. / Devin, put the camera on the table okay? If it weren't for her, Mina would still be here. That's not true Devin. / It's her fault Mina's dead. / Davin, davin./ No, it's not. Please put the camera down. / It's your fault. Davin. Let go. / Please, come on. Devin, just put it down! What did you do to me?! What did you do? / Hey! Hey, Devin. / What did you do? You don't understand, he's in danger. / He's in danger in getting charged of felony. Oh come on, Matt. His girlfriend just died. He's not exactly in his.. / It doesn't mean he can snap at one of my guys. Listen, we took a photo of him, and now this... thing inside the camera is gonna come here ... / Things in the camera? I know how it sounds. But this camera belonged to a serial killer, and now it's killing our friends. Okay, look. I know this is bad. I understand this is very hard on you. Avery's accident, Mina's suicide. / Look, it wasn't an accident. Tyler. / It's not a suicide. / And I get that sometimes, to deal with tragedies like these, we make up stories. Urban legends. / Right. Except this wasn't an urban legend. This guy was real. He lived in this town 40 years ago and his name was Roland Joseph Sable. Look, I want you to listen to me.. / Now, he's come back, we have his camera, and somehow, it's helping him continue this murder. / Stop this, now. This is his house, okay. If we could just go there.. / Listen to me! Okay, if I get one peep about you going anywhere near that house, your friend in there is gonna have a new roommate. I'll give you a minute with him. But then, I want you to go home, leave all this alone. This is police business. This is such bullshit. How's your hand? / It hurts. I'm sorry, about what I said. I know Mina wasn't your fault. But maybe me being next will buy you guys the time you needed. Just stop it. It's Kasey. Please tell me you've found an old neighbour or something. No, even better. Really? / Yeah, it turns out that Anne Faraday didn't buy the house in 1977. She just changed her name on the deed. Her real name is.. Lena Sable, she's Roland's wife. You guys should go check out the house, I'll stay here and keep digging. Can I help you? / Hey, yeah. Um.. Mrs. Sable? There's no one here by that name. / Wait, please. I have your husband's camera. Look, I know you changed your name, okay. But you were Mrs. Roland Joseph Sable, right? And this was his camera? / No. Well, I mean, it has his initials on it. Look. R. J. S. Rebecca James. Our daughter. What's going on out there? Is this her? She's pretty. She was. Um, what happened to her? There is the part of the story.. no one ever talks about. See, just because she was pretty, didn't mean she was without issues. Rebecca, bless her soul, was slow. Lived in her own world. The only thing that seemed to bring her out of it was that camera. After we gave it to her, she became attached to it. Took it everywhere with her. The kids at school started to tease her for it. But what started as harmless whispers, somehow got out of hand. One night, four kids tricked her into coming out. Poor Rebecca, had no idea. They took her most prized possesion, and turned it against her. They took horrible photos, no parents should ever have to see. The next day, they passed the photos around school. Humiliated her. The embarrassment is too much to bear, She couldn't handle it. We were both devastated. And then, Roland saw the photos. He became obsessed with that camera. We're punishing those four kids for their cruelty. He wanted to make them suffer. And he did. My husband, sought a father's vengeance. His anger turned him into a killer. Then they caught up with him. Then in the dark room at the school, he died. Holding that camera. The police confiscated all her pictures, but.. I held onto this one. Roland told me, he wouldn't stop until they were all punished. He never got to finish what he started. One of them got away. Bird, we have to go now. Bird. It's Devin. We have to go now. Now. So if Devin's dead, then we're next. / I know. Look, Kasey, you gotta come meet us in the school, alright. / Yeah, I'm heading over now. Okay bye. / Wait, are you sure about this? Yeah. I think I know how to fix this. Bird? Connor? Ugh, come on. Guys? Holy shit. Sheriff Pembroke. What are you doing here? / What am I doing here? I'm the police. And you're all breaking and entering. You followed us. You know that we're right about... / I followed you because you've been taking this camera thing too far. Bothering the Sable woman. / Oh, you're really concerned that we're bothering her? Or maybe, you're afraid of what she told us. She told you that I bullied her daughter until she killed herself? You're the one that got away. Put that thing down. Bird, listen to me, put that thing away. Connor, I can't do it. Give it to me. / Put it down! The only way he'll stop is if it gets to him before us. / Put it away! I'm sorry. I really am, I know it was a long time ago, but our friends are all dying because of what you did. / Jesus, you got it all wrong. Wish we all did get away from him. We didn't take those photos of Rebecca. Her father did. We tried to get the pictures, so we can take them to the police. But he found out, and snapped. Went crazy. Came after us, killed us one by one. To make sure his secret never came out. He took pleasure in our suffering. Thank God, the police got there before he could kill me. But Rebecca.. couldn't live with the guilt. That's why she hung herself. Check the dates, Rebecca killed herself after the murders. Rebecca was my friend. We were all her friends. But Lena Sable told us ... / Lena Sable stood by while all those happened. Of course she's gonna concoct some batshit stories. She's been blaming me and my friends ever since. He's coming. Behind you. Shoot him! Shoot him! Run! Bird, he's getting closer! Go! / It's stuck! Get the door! / Alright, go! It's a dead end. We need heat. I have to go find Connor, okay? You'll be safe here until I get back. Wants to take your picture, and use it against you. Wait. / What? Connor, we have to take it to him. We have to it someplace so that thing gets fully formed. Okay, go. Okay, quick. Bird, he's coming. Run! Fuck you! Oh my God, you're okay? / Hey. I thought you were dead. Is it over? He's gone. Guys. / You should sit down. Easy, easy. I'm never doing another stupid photobomb. You should take her to the hospital. What about you? You're hurt. / I know. There's something I have to do first.
