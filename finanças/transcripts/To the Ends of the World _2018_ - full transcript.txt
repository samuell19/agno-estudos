Indochina, 1945 The Vietnamese are opposed to French colonization. The uprising is commanded by Vo Binh Yen, lieutenant of the army of Ho Chi Minh. Fighting the war with China, Japan occupies the north of the country. March 9, 1945 Good day. My name is Robert Tassen. I am a soldier. I was wounded during the Japanese attack on March 9. Where did you serve? W Garrison, Camille Chautemps. Strange. They're all dead. I'm alive. I want to join the regiment. Except you're in a brothel. You have a military booklet? No. - A dog tag? - I do not have. Okay... Wait here. Do you want something to eat? I have no money. Thank you. I arrived the day before the massacre. I had an appointment with my brother and his wife. I can not find Robert Tassen. Henri Tassen. Not from the Chautemps garrison, but Chaubon, next to Haiphong. Impossible. We met in Chautemps. This 5 Infantry Regiment. I do not have all the data. Where did you serve in the country? Second Armored Division. Nod-sur-Seine. It's just bad luck. In France, the war is over. Here it begins. Seven thousand victims of the massacre. Not counting women and children. There is no time to count them all. I want to fight Vo Binh Yen. Our current goal is to protect the population of Indochina. Ho Chi Minh won't do it, let alone his lieutenants. Guerrilla war is spreading. Japan left a mess. Even the Vietnamese are killing each other. After such an experience, you can go back to France without shame. For what? Vo Binh killed my brother and his wife. Rather than the Japanese? Doesn't matter. Vo Binh was at the massacre. He let them. And you? Where were you? In the courtyard. Injured. They told his brother to watch as they gutted his wife. They took the child out of her and sewed her to her chest. Then he told his brother kneel and the Japanese beheaded him. Vo Binh was there. He watched. He smiled. Tassen? Robert Tassen? What? You want to smoke? AT THE END OF THE WORLD Where are you from? Mayenne. There are plenty of farmers there. Are you a peasant? If you want to. Are you allowing yourself to be called a peasant? Something is there. Check. It's a body. Whore. You let them do it! You are cowards. I should shoot you. Vile pigs! You betrayed us twice. Your friend, father, François, and me. I lost my confidence to you. Captain Sirbon will make you pay for it. You have 10 minutes to escape. Then we open fire. What do you think, Tassen? This is border control, it's unstable. One more time and you will be a deserter. You know what we do to them? We hang them. You want that? It's horsemeat, but better than cat. Where did all this blood come from? That`s nothing. Warn Maussier next time. Drink? - I have no time. - You don't it? I don't want it. Are you a fag? I'm asking whether you're a fag. New girl does not drink, boys. What is your name? Where are we going? I'm talking to you. Whore. You brought it? My brother was also beheaded. We have to bury him. Does Radio Hanoi still hear the accordion? I don't know. Accordion makes me want to cry. And you like the accordion? Accordion. You like it? No. You can stop, please? Stop it, whore! JULY There are ten men there. On the hill. Tassen! Tassen! Cavagna! Good thing they were such lousy shots. How's military food? What? How's military food? What do you care? Are they paying you to fight? And what, you want to change the front? Is that interesting to you? Do you want to be a Frenchman? Yes. I want to be a Frenchman. You know Vo Binh Yen? Do you recognize me? Yes. You were born under a lucky star. Could it be? It was close. What are you doing here? I'll explain another time. I have to go. St. Augustine "Confessions" "Who will show us good?". "They will hear our words ...". Very good. Can you walk? Yes. Eventually. How long did you live in that hut? A month. That little girl saved your life. It was she who found me. You owe them now. I owe nothing to nobody. Well, you know the commander of the garrison? He was my friend. Well suited to the army. He was very honest. You write about it? Probably. They also beheaded him. Decapitation is a French tradition. He left me a book. Do you have it? I thought I lost it. Should I give it back? No, some other time. Do you have any family in France? Yes. Foster mother. You're an orphan? No. My mother couldn't keep us. Did you meet her? She died three years ago. And the other? The foster mother. Do you love her? Of course. That's good. You'll find her yet. I don't think so. I will find Vo Binh. Go home. Start a family. At your age, it would be a pity to miss out on life. You've been wounded twice. It's better not to play with fate. I'll ask Captain Sirbona to take you back. You don't sleep here anymore. You are now a corporal. You got two. You got a gun. Who sleeps in the other bed? Khiet, a native. He arrived a week ago. He is a sergeant. I thought you returned to France. Who is this? Rigot. Dead. Anh stepped on a mine. We couldn't save him. Are you going? Where? The bar "Parrot". I want to get drunk. They talk constantly about relieving. What does that even mean? We need the support of the population. We liberate a village, and Vietnamese take it back. We must do the same. Attack from the cover at night. We are too visible and too French. French too? Whore! We need commandos. We attack the villagers and retreat. That's what Viet Minh do. Commandos, or who? Recruited from among the prisoners. Like Phong. We fraternize with Vietnamese? So what? I am French now. Will you dance, gentlemen? Today we have a nice girl. - How much? - 20 piastres. - For what? - Dancing, conversation. - Would you prefer ice cream? - I'm not talking with pigs. I wanted to come to the hospital, but it's complicated. Friends with someone? No, I was intoxicated. Intoxicated? Poor child. - What does he mean? - Never mind, I got drunk. No. Screw you! Screw yourself. Yes? Yes. Funny ... First, ask the ugly. One is toothless. Has black teeth. Legionnaires love it. Legia is full of Nazis. Shoot them like VietCong. French soldiers are too kind. They can not fight. Shut up, Thong. Or I will knock your teeth out. Look at the little one in blue. Beautiful, no? Hey, Tassen. Do you see the little one in blue? Commandos must have a name. I have no idea. The Yellow Tigers? What a stupid name! Yellow for the Tigers! Thong is right. Let's set up a commando unit with deserters. Maybe a card? French spoken here! Don't you recognise me? No. You once gave me soup. Don't you remember? Are you sure? Yes. What's your name? Robert. And you? Mai. You have a cigarette, Robert? Are you sure you don't remember me? Yes. Would you like to dance? I don't know. I can't dance. Is that what you want? It's here. Do you always do this at home? No, but it's late. I wanted to come back. Don't you find me attractive? I like you. Undress. I'll go now. It will be 100 piastres. Oh so. Excuse me. I'll see you again? If you want to. They did not kill you? No, Khiet. You see? You are lucky. They all work for VietCong. I know it. They threaten their families and ... It was good for you? What? With a girl. Yes. We leave early on Sunday. They blew up the bridge. SEPTEMBER What is this? Necklace. This is Dao's obsession. It's disgusting. Of course. There are some limits. We can not fall so low. We have no choice. I know about your pursuit of Vo Binh. From where? You have to serve France and not retaliate. I serve France. That's why I need the Viet Minh. Viet Minh? Prisoners of our camps. Thong has already been recruited. Not enough? No. I need a dozen. I'll cut your throat. Not if we feed them and pay them. Just like us. They will win it for us. I was promised a dozen Frenchmen. We've been waiting for a month. Not a word more about Vo Binh, okay? - Tissier is dead. - You threw a grenade? Where are the others? Come. - Where? - Come. To Pingoët. - What is? - He has a leech on his dick. Let's see. Whore. You can go? Do not cut it off? You don't use it anyway. What about Phong? Khiet doesn't want to take him to his mother. What about her? He says he is sick. Is there any food? - How far is this village? - More than a dozen kilometers. Khiet, why not take it? We've seen Vo Binh's people there. Too much risk. Vo Binh was there? I do not know. Can I come in? Why? - Are you with someone? - No, but you must warn me. You can not come here. You must not. You have to pay me. Come today to "Parrots". Today, I can not. We leave the village. That's tomorrow. Tomorrow I might not be here. Not me ... Give it to me. You have been at it again? With whom? The girl with the yellow tiger. Been there? Yes. And? So what? What's so special? Nothing. Sure. You got it in the face. It is like a leech sucking, just you do not see it. They will eat you alive. - Are you done? - As Thong. This slut, I feel it. - Feeling bored. - So be it. They've fucked us, see. In the ass. As the girl. You know who it is? No. A frenchman. Motherfuckers! Where do the Viet Minh keep their prisoners? On the other side. Unfortunately, the hospital is gone. Where did you take him? The surgeon Bai, but for the cock it may be too late. Time to go. Gentlemen. How will you choose the prisoners? Use the fittest. They will do anything for food. Thong wants the night off to meet his mother. Sirbonowi you say? No, what? Talk to me. What do you mean? I'm not stupid. You told him about Vo Binh. Any problem? Thong should not go alone. - What do you mean? - We have to accompany him. Sure, Vo Binh is waiting. Yellow Tigers is laughable. How is your little whore. I was in Saigon. One big party. Pure decadence. As if the French celebrated the ruin of Europe. You returned to tell me that? No. No. I was in Chautemps the day of the massacre, as were you. But before I left. We belong to the same family. Family survivors. Why didn't you say anything? Survivor syndrome. When I heard the story of the Lord's command, I felt less lonely, less guilty. Guilty of what? Being alive. Don't you feel it? What were you doing there? I wanted to see the man who took control of the Delta. Vo Binh Yen himself. He killed my brother. Really? He killed him? He allowed it. It's the same thing. I don't think so. You knew what would happen. No. Vo Binh advised me to go. And you went, just like that. Yes, I went. I went. What was I to do? Stay? Whose side are you on? Anyone. Maybe that's why I went. This is not my war. I love this country and these people. You're a great guy, you love everyone. No. For example, I did not like your brother. What did my brother do? We'll talk about that another time. Do you think we'll meet again? He was a close friend of my son. I thought he had a good influence on him. He did not try to dissuade him from fighting in France. My son went to his death at the hands of Germany. He forced him? No. But he encouraged him. You are right. Sticking to me won't bring him back. There are enemies against which we are powerless. I'm not talking about Vo Binh Yen. I'm talking about you. And your internal enemy. Please take care of yourself, but forget about me. I can not help you. Who was that? A writer. What did he say? What did he want? Nothing. He knew my brother. It annoys me. I don't like it. There's nobody you like. He looks like the devil. - What? - Whore, Cavagna. - Where are you going? - Get lost. Don't go with Phong. We must have a plan. The place is crawling with snipers and traps. - I'm not going. - You are only looking for Binh Vo. - Take your hand. - Or what? That's all? You strike like a girl. Enough? Peace? I didn't think you'd come back. Why? There are other girls. I'm not like that. Yes. Yes what? Good day. What do you want? Greeting. Don't you see we are eating? Undress. I was going to. Don't argue. This isn't right. What? It is, as you say. And what should I say? I say this because you fuck with the soldiers. Open your legs. Open your legs, it's your job. Like you take the others? Like a dog? You like that? Sometimes. Don't you have enough? In your place I would. Why don't you admit that you remember me? Go away. Well. You have a match? Keep them. Weren't you in it? I do not like leftovers. What? Something's wrong? Where do we put them? To that building. We cleaned it. - When did they arrive? - Two hours ago. Why didn't you let me know? Phong deserted. - Seriously? - He didn't show up for roll call. - It is true? - Yes, of course. He went to see his mother. Just that. It's not my fault. I was not two hours! Nobody said anything. Fuck you all. NOVEMBER I want to take the subway. Give me one. Change at Nation. That's all you do? And, Cavagna. What "Cavagna"? Cavagna says "screw you." You think you can play the boss and push us around? What do you have? You think you have a long cock? It's time to go home. "It's time to go home." Only. You know, it's not so easy. Someone is waiting for you? Waiting for? At Nation. Someone waiting? No one is waiting for me. You know about it. That's why you want to return? You never thought about going back? I do not want to die here. It's on your mind, huh? No. I do not want you to die. Could it be? Of course. Stupid for asking. We're too young to die. Don't you want to have children? Go get recruits. They are not ready. They have to come with me. They can't take it. - Who are you going with? - With you. No. You're a sergeant. And you command. In command of his unit. You can not. - Khiet is dead. He got a bullet in the heart. - I know. - He had to wait for us. - What? Idiot. We had to attack together. - Do you know who I am? - I would like to know. We'll count afterwards. As you wish. Well now. No. - What does it mean? - I do not understand. Vo Binh? - What? - There is nothing about him? I do not know. - And? - It's coded. Do not knock or shake it up. Cleanse the village and join us. - People have diarrhea. - Me too. They are seriously ill. When do we withdraw? We are not backing down. What are you playing? We have no such orders. We are staying. Whore, Tassen ... Return to Maussier, if you want. You're an asshole. I want it too. What? To have children. Has it anything to do with the fact that you shit yourself? To have children, you have to love a woman. When this is over, so be it. Sure. There's no more serum? Maussier took it. Only opium can cure diarrhea. Do you have any? Do you have any or not? Give it to me. I don't feel anything. Do you hear it? What? It's quiet. Relax. Think about something else. The subway? Come on. He flew away completely. Whore, she begins to hit. It's you? Come. Come. We will never part. Never. Oh my. Look everywhere! Translator, Dao! Roast your ass! We found them. Why didn't you shoot him? He lives alone with his daughter. He has a baby at his age? It's his? Hold. Where are the others? He doesn't know. He doesn't want to die. Oh so? Whore, it has to stop. No, it's so pleasant. Tunnel. How many of them are there? Three. - Toss a grenade there? - I want them alive. We won't fit. It's too small. This mouse hole. Fucking mouse hole! What the fuck? Where is this tunnel exit? Who fired the shot? I did. Well. You are brave. Take the rest. Not you. Where did you get a gun? Do you know Vo Binh? He was here? He does not retreat. Is everywhere. Sure. But the prey. Two children and the blind. - Blind? - This is my sister. I need these soldiers. Well, you speak French. Come with us, we do not touch them. I'm not a traitor like him. What did he say? Where is he hiding? Tell Vo Binh my name is Robert Tassen, and that he's dead meat. Tassen. Do you understand? Vo Binh was killed a month ago. One of his own people stabbed him. You should be happy. One from Maussier. Applies to you. He writes that you insulted him. It is true. And you're a bad Frenchman. Too gentle with the natives. What makes a good Frenchman? Keeping with the occupiers? What do I do with this report? Maussier is strange. He can hurt you. You do not answer to him. What does it mean? You have a free hand. Do what you want with your gooks. Anyway, you are already doing it. I'll never be as you wish. There will always be other men. Do you like them? No. They do not make trouble. Come. I saw a shooting star in the jungle. It exploded. It was not a star. It's war. You're with them? I'm free. I almost got him. - Who? - Vo Binh. You should not kill him. Is a hero. Hero? Yes. Of freedom. I'm tired of being the last. I'm nobody's girl. I will pay. You have not enough money. You depend only on the money? You have your money. Satisfied? I don't want it. So I have to fuck you for free? - Go away. - I paid. Can I fuck you? Get out of my face. I'll fuck you. Leave me! Stop! I don't love you! Repeat it. Repeat it. - Already! - I don't love you. And I never will! - Tell me you hate me! - I hate you! DECEMBER Boring here recently, do not you think? So. Today I'm going to "Parrots". You want to go? No. Have you heard about Pingoët? They cut him. This is the third draft of this chapter. I think I'll throw it out. I should thank you. Well, you came up with that, because it just so happens, I have so little company. Anyway... I have a cognac. Now. What do I owe this honor? Nothing. I was in the area. I thought you ... "Maybe I'll stop by to apologize?" Yes? Apologize for what? For calling me a coward. I never said that. You thought so loudly I heard. You think I'm on the wrong side? It will be better if you go. Do not you went through such a route, to now just go. I'm leaving tomorrow on a mission. Actually. So what would you tell me? Don't rush. The same will come. Time decides for us. Always has the last word. It's about a girl. A whore in the "parrot". You got something against prostitutes? No. This is why the face? You're lucky. I can't stop thinking about her. Both mix things up. It makes you forget about revenge? No. Love takes place. This is not right. Where do you want to put your revenge? You're not the only one. People fall in love. The prostitute? What is changing? Love is wonderful. Wonderful that soldiers fuck her? There is nothing to talk about. You're drunk. How do we learn to love our pain? Listen? "To love means not to know the pain, love or even pain. " Sounds familiar? What do you think? I love my pain? Every day I try to do something about it. I'm talking to it. Please, to resign. But we never get rid of it. We have to live with it. - No thanks. - You have no choice. We are both survivors. Perhaps most interesting is salvation. It is at once terrifying and enormous. Nothing is given to us. We need to look for it. I don't find it. What is her name? Journalists. They write a report. Corporal Tassen. Stubborn as a donkey. - Senechal, the newspaper Paris Match. - Good morning. Kuskaz, my photographer. He was on the outside. He asked about you. Show him. He says Vo Binh did it. He knows where he is. How did he get here? They brought him. Does Sirbon know? No. Do not tell him. I'll handle it. No photos. So what? We drive? Give me a roll. - What is? - photos are prohibited. Roll. - It's their job. - Shut up. Will you let me if I take it myself? Cavagna's not back yet? No. - Do you know Hoang Ty? - It's behind the mountains. What do you think about this child? Vo Binh is cruel. Would be capable of that. Do you think it's a trap? Yes. Want to play? No, I need to breathe. Hve you seen Cavagna? He was here before. When he came out? I think he went to the girl. Drink? No. - Have you seen Maï? - No, but we have other girls. Get out of here. Hey, soldier. You want to smoke? Come. Tassen. Sit down. My head's spinning. Slowly. Slowly. And? What? Did you fuck Maï? Cholera, Robert. Yes or no? No. You're lying. Fine. I fucked her. Glad? Don't pretend you didn't fuck her, admit it. Shut up. Tomorrow we go to Hoang Ty. Yes. Very good. We bury all the severed heads. Cocks too. Disgusting. We'll get him. What is wrong with this pipe? Hoang Ty ... We only miss Hoang Ty. Robert! I am leaving. Tomorrow. When will you come back? I will not come back. What's happening? Wait. I need to talk with him. We have to stop. The boy can't do it. Hey, Robert! I hate you, whore. You'll want to pack it in? A hundred meters away are the footprints. Two men. Give him a grenade. Wait. You stopped sulking? There is sulking. I'm not your fucking Vietnamese girls. I wouldn't even want to. I really don't understand what you're worried about. I prefer guys, you asshole. I'm gay. I pull the wire. - What is? - Fucking snake. All right? Bit me. Fuck. Show me. Fuck. So stupid! Don't leave me. Stay. Cholera, metro... I would get lost. I've never been in Paris. Only gooks are left. And me. No, you're one of us. The child disappeared. What now? We're going anyway? There are no more candles? Wait. I'll read this piece. "After defending his work father decided to break away from Paris. First, thinking about Bordeaux, but being at the centre of the black slave trade it was acceptable to him. So he found a less obvious place: Lille. It was a good choice, because in the capital of Flanders he met my mother. This meeting marked the beginning of an affair lasting 50 years. Only grief could stop this love. I ended right here in Indochina. Years later I met there too the woman I fell in love with. A woman who died at the age of 50, before giving me a son, who lost his life at the age of 25 years. " Grief is a strange feeling. Sometimes it seems to us that she left us, but didn't... It's still there, fused with our anger. Go to sleep. Keeping the hospital in Hanoi is a completely different thing. Do you know Professor Gramet of Rouen? He told me about silent patients, who suddenly ... regained speech. If you do not want to speak, Maï, No one here will force you. I do not suggest any form of pressure. Aphasia of traumatic substrate is serious. Forcing is a terrible idea. Let me ask you something? I do not expect an answer now, but please think. Would it ever be possible ... There is no hurry, but still ... Have you ever be possible ... to ask you to marry me? See you soon. Safe trip.
