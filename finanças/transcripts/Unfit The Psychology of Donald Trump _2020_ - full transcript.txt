In the armed forces, there's a nuclear weapons program called the personnel reliability program. Do you have personal defects? Do you have financial problems which could compromise you? Do you have a problem with infidelity? This is the program where they screen you. To see if you can be trusted to hold an M 16 to guard the truck that might carry a nuclear weapon. Not that it will, then it might. That also is the program where they determine whether you're an air force missile flight officer, whether you can go down into a bunker and be responsible to turn the keys on a minute, man, three missile, the chairman of the joint chiefs that is an entire scaled evaluation program. That shows your personal reliability to carry out your orders and to do the highest risk things like fly a B 52 bomb or a B two bomber and drop a nuclear weapon. The president of the United States doesn't have to meet any of these parameters. None of them whatsoever, because the electorate choosing you clears you. Into all of these programs. We have a president of the United States who was duly elected. He was put into office, given the great faith of the people who voted him in. I, Donald John Trump do solemnly swear. I Donald John Trump do solemnly swear. And if we look at the great presidents of the United States is one unifying thing. They maintained the continuity in how the constitution was upheld and defended. So help me, God. So help me go. Congratulations, Mr. President, the first two where it's mostly chest flirting or name calling and Enstone suggesting Donald Trump was a lunatic. This man is a pathological liar guarantee. I have a vocabulary better than all of them. Most of them. I know I have an IQ better than all of them. I'm very highly educated. I know words I have the best words I have to, but there's no better words than stupid. Ah, I don't know what I said. I don't remember. I could stand in the middle of fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn't lose any voters. Okay. Recently, the conversation about the president's mental state has taken a more serious tone. I can't explain this crazy behavior, but I can call it crazy. We've taken this. Big beautiful ship. And it's being turned around very quickly. I'm not a psychologist or a psychiatrist, but the guy needs therapy USA. I am the chosen one. Everyone seems to have that opinion. Donald Trump being unfit. Good evening. Uh, thank you guys for coming. I know our fish first official press briefing is going to be on Monday, but I wanted to give you a few updates on the president's activities. Uh, but before I get to the news of the day, I think I'd like to discuss a little bit of the coverage of the past 24 hours. Yesterday at a time when our nation and the world was watching the peaceful transition of power, some members of the media were engaged in deliberately false reporting. Photographs of the inaugural proceedings were intentionally framed in a way in one particular tweet to minimize the enormous support that had gathered on the national mall. No one had numbers. This was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration period, both in person and around the globe. Even the New York times printed a Fataar. Why put him out there though for the very first time and utter a false hood. Why did he do that? It undermines the credibility of the entire white house press office. Yeah, don't be so don't be so overly dramatic about it. Chocolate. What is it? You're saying it's a falsehood and they're giving Sean Spicer our press secretary gave alternative facts to that, but the point that look alternative facts are not facts. They're false sites. My name's George Conway. I'm a lawyer. I'm a litigator. Principally practice securities litigation I've argued appeals, including a case. In the big case in the Supreme court. My wife was Donald Trump's campaign manager, and now is counselor to the president. I was a Republican since probably about 1980, when Ronald Reagan was elected president. I voted for Donald Trump in 2016. And I almost took a job in the justice, taught myself to run the civil division of the trauma of justice, Donald Trump. Wasn't my first choice among the Republican nominees, but I was hopeful that he would calm down and get better. As time went on, he started to show a little more discipline. He would only go off the rails every third day instead of every day. But the problem was once he got into the Supreme position of power, he lost some of his incentive to be disciplined. And I'm thinking at this point in time, what is wrong with Donald Trump is like a practical joke that got out of hand. I mean, that's the problem. I mean, I didn't go into the administration for. A lot of reasons, but the fundamental reason was it was a mess. I guess I must've been Googling Trump and mental health because I clearly thought there's something seriously wrong with him. And I came across an article in rolling stone magazine. Is Trump a malignant narcissist and a number of people like Dr. Gartner or interviewed. And as soon as I read that, I realized that's it. You cannot understand his presidency without knowing this. My name is John gardener. I'm a psychologist. Um, I taught in the department of psychiatry at Johns Hopkins university for 28 years. I've written some books and I'm the founder of duty to warn an organization of mental health professionals that believe that Donald Trump should be removed because he's psychologically unfit. My name is Lance Doda, so I'm a psychiatrist and a psychoanalyst. I've spent most of my research career looking at compulsive and addictive behavior, and I've become interested in importance of psychology and politics in recent years because of the threat to our country. My name is Justin Frank, a psychoanalyst and a psychiatrist I've been in practice in DC for about 40 years. Does Donald Trump fit to serve as the president and commander in chief? I can answer that with one word. No, Trump is associate path, a sadist, a con-artist racist and misogynist, a sexist in general. And I think it is a problem. How dare liberals people on the left try to. Undo democracy by accusing a president of being mentally ill without any basis. Look, these psychiatrists now who are trying to diagnose without ever having met the man, this is not the first time the left has gone at Republicans. They did the same thing to Barry Goldwater. They did the same thing to Ronald Reagan over the thousands of CAPTRUST diagnosed Barry Goldwater and said he was a mentally ill. They were then rebuked by the American psychiatric association and said, do not make diagnoses. Without seeing the patient and they continue to do it today. The election campaigns in full swing and New Hampshire battle, whether it's state of the nation that goes to the polls on March 10th and growing support for Goldwater. So the Goldwater rule has an interesting history in 1964, Barry Goldwater ran for president and a now defunct magazine fact magazine did a survey of psychiatrists and published an article saying, psychiatrists, think the gold water is unfit. Goldwater sued them. And he won. Uh, and as it turns out, actually he deserved to win. It was libelous. Uh, he was not, um, unstable and the psychiatrists who wrote those statements about Goldwater. It's important for people to understand the history of our field. This was in the sixties when Freudian psychiatry really ruled through the roost. This is what I've discovered. We are constantly bedeviled by powerful unconscious forces in RV. And so their explanations were things like he's a latent homosexual. He's been scarred by his potty training. He has an unresolved Oedipus complex based on unconscious hate of his own father caused by childhood jealousy, 40th psychiatri. Though it has many important and positive aspects and help move the profession forward. It's not been used well, in terms of it's analyzing public figures. I actually interviewed the last living member of the ethics committee that formed the Goldwater rule. And he said, these were obviously wild speculations. They weren't founded in fact. And so they embarrassed the profession because they were really, uh, idle speculations. And so that's why they passed that rule. He said to me, we never intended it to be a gag order, meaning that psychiatrist could never speak up about public figures. We just didn't want them making unfounded statements. The Goldwater rule today has been incorrectly, extended, and the incorrect part about it is that it now is being used to suppress speech about things that are knowable. It says nonsensical saying an orthopedic surgeon. Shouldn't be able to watch somebody in a football injury and say that person probably has an ACL tear. He can say it because he's an expert in the field. Something happened. He observed it. People need to understand is that actually the psychiatric interview is the least reliable method of making a diagnosis because art current diagnostic system, the DSM is based on observable behavioral criteria. Well, when you meet with someone, they can lie to you. So they can say, Oh, I never did that. Or I don't do that. But if you could actually observe their behavior, if you could follow them around, if you can watch them on TV, if you could read their social media, if you could talk to all their significant others, you'd probably get a much more reliable indicator of how they behave. Hey, I'm not concerned about anything with you may have shy investigation because it's a hoax or you that's enough. Put down the mic. I am more confident in my diagnosis with Donald Trump than any diagnosis I've ever made before, because I have more information by outward appearance. You're 10 years older than you were a year ago. Some weirdnesses vetted my bones. It's not true that having any kind of mental health disorder would make someone a bad president. Uh, one of my favorites books is a book called Lincoln's melancholy about how Lincoln's being a depressive personality is part of what allowed him to win the civil war. He had a capacity to endure mental suffering that was baked in to who he was. And so the enormous burden of the civil war. Was something he was actually able to endure. I have seen what's happened in this last four years. When in my state, when people lose their jobs, it's a good chance. I'll know them by their names. Uh, bill Clinton, I wrote a biography of bill Clinton about how his hypomania was part of what energized him in terms of his charisma and his creativity. And it also had to do with his impulse control problems and his hypersexuality. So it was a double-edged sword, but it, it doesn't just qualify someone for being president. If they have a. Psychological disorder, but Donald Trump shows clear signs of the most severe personality disorder. It's called malignant narcissism. And it was first introduced by Eric, from who escaped the Nazis and spent a lot of his life trying to understand that the psychology of evil and he formulated this diagnosis of malignant narcissism, which has four components, narcissism, paranoia. Antisocial personality disorder and sadism. I think everybody knows Donald Trump's a narcissist by now. I will be the greatest jobs producer that God ever created. I know more about ISIS than the generals do believe me or you're consulting with consistently, so that you're ready on day one. I'm speaking with myself. Number one, because I have a very good brain, but it's the other three components that make him truly dangerous. Because many politicians are narcissistic, but he's also paranoid. So all of his crazy conspiracy theories, the state of Hawaii released my official long form birth certificate. The birth certificate was produced in 2011. You continued to tell the story and question the president's legitimacy in 2012, 13, 14, 15. Yeah. How about this one about Ted Cruz. His father, father was with Lee Harvey Oswald prior to Oswaldo being shot. And nobody even brings it up. And his sense of being victim, Mr. Trump turned his sights on Google tweeting. They have it rigged for me and others. So that almost all stories and news is bad. And is demonization. Of anyone who disagrees with him nasty guy. Now I know why he doesn't have one endorsement from any of this colleagues. John, I pick from the buffet they're nasty guy. These are all signs of a paranoid process, antisocial personality disorder, or what used to be called psychopathy or sociopathy. That's constant lying. Well, he's the most documented liar in human history. I think at this point, It's violating the rights of other people and exploiting other people. So sexual assault would be violating the rights of other people, uh, not paying your bills or defrauding people through Trump university viewed example of exploiting other people. And it's breaking laws and breaking norms. Well, he's broken every norm of the presidency. That's one of the reasons he's so out of control, there's certain norms we thought no one would ever break, but it's part of his personality disorder to break norms and to break laws. And it's a lack of remorse. He has no guilt or anxiety about the destructive things that he does. Impeachment for that. It was beautiful. It was just a perfect conversation. And the fourth component that Erich Fromm identified is sadism, truly taking pleasure in harming humiliating and degrading other human beings. If you read his tweets, I wrote an introduction to a book about the streets. I had to read thousands of his tweets. And they literally made me ill because it was just one vicious attack on and humiliating insult. After another, after another, I was like, how can someone even come up with thousands of vicious things to say about so many people, but he enjoys degrading and humiliating and insulting others. I do think that we have enough evidence that most psychiatrists would feel like it's important to warn about Trump. We have a duty to warn. Psychologists and really all, uh, mental health professionals have the duty to protect society if there's a risk to society. So the terrorist off case was in the 1970s, a patient said to a psychologist, I'm going to go home and murder my girlfriend. The psychologist didn't warn the potential victim and the patient went home and killed the girlfriend. And it's now the law in all 50 States, that if you are aware that a patient might be a danger to someone, confidentiality goes out the window and confidentiality is one of our core values, but it's more important to warn someone who could be harmed than it is to maintain even our core value of confidentiality. Trump is not my patient. He's not saying I'm gonna go kill my girlfriend. But the number of people who were at risk, the number of people who could be harmed, isn't one person, it's hundreds of millions of people. So if we didn't speak up would be the immorality. What annoys me about the Goldwater rule? The way it's being interpreted now is it's being interpreted as if we are being not unethical by speaking out and warning the public. When in fact I asked this question to whom will history be kinder? Those who spoke up during the age when Trump Rose or those who were silent. I want the cleanest water owners. I want the cleanest air on earth and that's what we're doing. And I'm an environmentalist yet. A lot of people don't understand that I have done more environmental impact statements probably than anybody that's I guess I can say definitely. Cause I've done many, many, many of them. More than anybody that's ever been president or vice president or anything even close to precedent. And I think I know more about the environment than most people. Gaslighting is a crucial tool of abusive personalities. It is lying to someone in a way that makes them doubt their own perception of reality. I'm Dr. Romany de Fossella. I'm a professor of psychology. It's an interesting in the place where the origin of this term Gaslight came from, it came from a, what was a play in the thirties, and then became a film called Gaslight. And it was about a man who was slowly trying to drive his wife. Matt, look, I asked him, does it, does when someone turns on another light in the house, Did you turn on another light? No, there's no one in the house. Fidesz the guests lights kept getting turned up and down and he was denying having done it. You're going to see a doctor. I met him. Nope. More than one doctor tomorrow morning. Very common sorts of gaslighting statements or things like it never happened that way. You must be losing your mind. Um, they'll literally say things happened that didn't happen. I didn't do that. I didn't say that many people call gaslighting a form of emotional abuse because what you're really doing is setting out to confuse another person. When you confuse someone like that, you really do almost render them more vulnerable to you and actually easier to coerce because now they don't. Really know which way is up. It's as though you've sort of turned gravity off and turn them upside down. Remember the point where Trump said, listen, don't pay attention to what you're seeing. Don't pay attention to what you're hearing, what you're seeing and what you're reading is not what's happening. And it's interesting because as human beings we're actually vulnerable to this. There's a famous experiment and. Social psychology called the Ash experiment. The Ash experiment is they showed lines on a screen. One is clearly longer than the other, and they asked them to which line is longer and they get a correct a hundred percent of the time too. Then you bring in four Confederates who work for the experimenter, but you pretend they're also in the study as, as subjects. And they all say that the shorter line is longer. Three, three, three. Three. 50% of the time the person will reverse themselves and say, you're right. I must, the shorter line is the longer one. We're very subject to the influence. Our reality testing is very subject to the influence of social pressures. So when he does these things that are blatantly destructive and disordered, and yet people act as if they're normal and they poopoo these, uh, observations. Eventually, we began to question ourselves and think, Oh, well maybe I'm wrong. Maybe it's actually is normal. It has been so disturbing is that we've discovered at least some of us that it's much quicker to demolish a building than to build one. And Trump understands that and I think he can demolish a lot of our faith as a nation in our institutions. He can demolish the effectiveness of institutions. He can certainly. Uh, psychologically, uh, confused and Gaslight people, uh, like nobody's business. I said during the transition, I'll say it up here. Uh, I think there's been at times a disconnect. Between the way we see the president and how much we love the president and the way some of you perhaps see the president on. I certainly see the American people probably see the president the way I do, uh, but we want to get that message out there. Uh, and, uh, do you use a wall street expression? There might be an arbitrage spread between how well we are doing and how well some of you guys think we're doing and we're going to work hard to close that spread my name's Anthony Scaramucci. Um, I spent 11 days in the white house as the president's communications director. Trump is wickedly smart. The guy made it to the American presidency. He's not stupid. You can hate Trump because he says asshole ish things. Okay. And he's an obnoxious guy at times, but what you're missing is that he's now a reflection of the cultural Zeit guest. He's an avatar of that anger. So when he's lighting people up on Twitter, a very large group of people in United States that are actually giggling and they enjoy it. What are your earliest memories of don't Trump? My own. Remember that Donald Trump were actually 1983, uh, during the Christmas season, um, I visited the Trump tower. The Trump tower, when it's completed will be $400 million worth of high priced apartments, commercial space, and boutiques what's happened is phenomenal. I've never seen anything to the extent that I have in New York. Now from a real estate standpoint, it's probably become the hottest city in the world. That building was a brand new building in the center of New York. And it was a lot of publicity and fanfare Scott brass and a ton of pink marble. And it's a modern structure. And he did a great job marketing it. He sold out the condominiums and he built himself a triplex, which literally looks like Louis the 14th, smoke crystal meth, and then decorated it for him. I mean, it's like ridiculous walking into his office. He had a ton of pictures of himself on the wall, ton of magazine covers and all that sort of stuff. I read the art of the deal when I was in law school, when it first came out and I said, okay, this guy's. Uh, got it going on. Uh, ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the author of this book right here. Trump, the art of the deal, Donald Trump at the beginning of the show, I said, you either love him or you hate him. Not. Do you find that that's true or does everybody love you or does everybody hate you? People love me and a few really have great distaste for me. Yeah. Uh huh. And why, why, why is it that those people, that few would not care for you because you're saying no. No, I don't think so. It's just a, I sort of speak my mind a little bit, a little bit like you in that race. Yeah. A little bit like a little bit like me, not too much. Hopefully. What were you like as a kid? Very normal in a lot of respects, but a very, very solid job. He grew up in Queens. Uh, his father was making good money as he was being raised. He built a lot of lower middle income housing on the border of Brooklyn and Queens. Fred Trump was a successful businessman. He made a lot of money and he was smart at what he did. However, Fred Trump was a dishonest, crooked guy. Who stole from the federal government who wouldn't allow blacks, people to move into his apartments? His father said, you've got to be a killer. You've got to be King. You've gotta be tough. And he took that in. Is is what you do, something you've always wanted to do. I know your father, wasn't still as a real estate followers in the real estate business. And I've, uh, I've been in that in other businesses, different things. Uh, I like what I'm doing. I just enjoy what I'm doing. I love the real estate business. I learned a lot from my father more than anything else. I learned a lot. He wanted to make a name for himself. And he believed early on in his career that having a lot of publicity and a lot of profile was going to be good for the sales and marketing of his. Apartment buildings and condominiums and things that he was doing, but he also wanted to have a unique celebrity persona. And so Howard stern represented that for him. said that, uh, the best way to treat a woman is to treat her like duty. No, I never said that, but I never did. It was attributed to men. So you never did say that. No, I never said that, but it was attributed to me, I say, so you treat women with respect. Uh, I can't say that either. All right. Good. All right. Somewhere in between I do I diamond. I treat women with great respect, treat women somewhere in between respect and, uh, do-do initial impressions of Donald Trump. Like everybody else. I was starstruck. Back then speaking about women that way it was more, yeah, the norm where's Marla go. I think we have to put moral or right up. Come on. Let's do that. Let's take down Frederick. I went to a fundraiser right after Ivana and Donald divorced. So I was excited that he was there. I went up to him and I said, hello. I'm a huge Howard stern fan. And I wanted to introduce myself and he said, why would I speak to you when there's so many beautiful women here? I wouldn't even let you suck my Dick. One of the problems here is that Donald Trump doesn't have empathy and that's not a modest statement. He literally has no empathy. He does not feel emotions like care and, and its associate path. Well, that's, I've said since 2016 in the new Yorker, when he started to run for president, yes, he is associate path. There is no question. He's associate path, meaning he neither has a conscience, nor does he have a heart. You make it sound like blade runner. When they, they go to the replicant, the replicant knows you've found the man. He doesn't feel anything. Anyway. Doesn't feel anything. Empathy is a normal human trait. It's actually normal in all. Mammals. It starts in childhood with a. Parents and a child and it continues throughout society. It's what glues people together instead of just fighting against each other. Almost everybody has empathy, but not everybody. People who don't have empathy are the people that we call sociopaths or psychopaths. That sounds like a very destructive business philosophy. They often were treated cruelly. They were treated without empathy themselves. You talk in your book about getting even the importance of getting even his revenge. Sweet. I strongly in getting, even if somebody has hurt you, if somebody's gone out of their way to hurt you, I think that if you have the opportunity, you should certainly go out of your way to do a number of them. And I've had more criticism about that one statement in my book than any other statement. The clergy is called the ministers, the priests, the rabbis, they've all said what a terrible thing to say. That's against our teachings. I just believe it. I believe in an eye for an eye. If you don't have normal empathy, you're going to mistreat people because they don't matter. There's an absence of loyalty. The absence of loyalty is a sign of antisocial personality disorder. Loyalty at its best means. I care about this person. I value this person. So I will stick by this person. If you have a person without empathy, what you find is that loyalty disappears. As soon as the other person crosses them. As soon as somebody says, I'm not with you anymore, or I disagree. It flips from you are the greatest person to you are a horrible person. You are a worthless person and I will attack you. I will destroy you. You know, some of the people that were most loyal to me and people that I didn't think would be some of the people that were least loyal to me or people that I think I would have treated him differently. I think it would have treated different groups differently. I would have wiped the floor with the guys that weren't loyal, which I will now do, which is great. You know, I love getting even with PayPal, but you're going to get, even with some people. Because was given the opportunity. If given the opportunity, I will get either with some people that were just loyal to here comes. One of the things they say about you is that they're ticks within you, a vindictiveness, the people who climb to the top by squashing other people. Those are what we call a successful associate path. So let's see pads can be successful. It's because they're con men. If you're a con man, you're convincing them that you are much better, greater, more caring, more honest than you are. My name is Rick Riley. I'm a golf writer and I've known Trump for. 35 years, maybe Trump is among our best golfing precedents for 72 year old guy. Trump is a good golfer. He's got a really good, powerful move through the ball and he hits a long way. And, uh, his pudding is good. It's very risky, sort of old school. Putter cheating in golf at all is completely wrong because it's the easiest sport to cheetah. There's no reps, there's no ups. You could cheat every shot if you want it, but it reveals your character that you don't, or it reveals your character that you do. And he cheats all the time. I actually played golf with him with Anthony Anderson one day. Gotcha. And we were all playing together and we clearly saw him hit a ball, hook the ball into a Lake at Trump national in Jersey. And his caddy told him he found it. You know, people don't know this, but Jerry rigs has golf carts to go really fast. He has somebody do that. Only one golf cart at every course, he owns goes about 30 miles an hour and that's his. It's number one, everyone else goes is about 15 to 18 miles per hour, so he can hit the ball. Zip he's out. You're still, Hey, where's trunk. You hit, you hit by then he can kick the ball, move the ball, take it out of lakes, whatever. Usually you would put a Mark down, pick up the ball. What he does. He secretly puts the marker on the end of the putter, and then he looks like he's marking it. But really now the Mark is three feet closer. That's a ways your putt. He tried to cheat tiger woods and around the golf. Once tiger fricking woods, he's off to the right he's playing against tiger woods. They each have a partner. Uh, he chokes one flat into the water splash. He says to his partner, throw me another one. They didn't. I make that's tiger woods tiger. We are inspired by everything. You've become an attained. The job you've done is incredible. He's telling people he's won club championships. That he didn't even play him. He won a club championship. That's being played in Bedminster, New Jersey when he was playing in Philadelphia. And he said, called and said, Hey, what, what won the club championship today? And the guy goes, uh, 75, Joe Schmoe, Joe Schmo on it. Ah, I shot 73 today. Make me the champion and the pros, like what? Yeah. Make me the champion. I played better here today. So Joe Schmoe's name comes off the wall, maybe one of his great moments of his life and Trump's name goes up, and this has happened over and over again. And then he won at least six or seven times tournaments where he was the only guy playing in the tournament. He'll buy a new golf course, play the first round by himself and millennia. And unless millennia gets hot, he's going to be the winner. And so if you go to any of his courses, his first few years, it's just him because no one else played. As a writer. I love Donald Trump. I loved him because he would say anything. It was like, yeah, I banged Marilyn Monroe and I punched out Sinatra and we're like, yeah, what else you got? Because he'd say it. But as an American, I don't like him at all. He terrifies me. If he's going to cheat a golf, you don't think he's going to cheat on his taxes and he's going to cheat on his wives. You don't think he's going to cheat to win an election. You're just going to cheat to stop an investigation. You don't think he's going to cheat. To break rules to get information from foreign countries. My God, he just admitted he does it. So I came to Washington over 30 years ago to work in the Reagan administration was chief of staff to the vice president and the George H w Bush white house. So I worked in government, worked in some Republican politics, edited the weekly standard for the lower two decades. I'm Richard painter. I'm a law professor at the university of Minnesota. I was the chief white house ethics lawyer for president George W. Bush. Most of my life, I was in the Republican party. Uh, Malcolm Nance, uh, former us intelligence officer started out actually in, in cryptology. And I'm sort of an expert in all things related to foreign intelligence, operations, counterterrorism, and now Russian intelligence activities in the United States. the traits that are important in a leader vary, but there are some absolute constants. And the way to look at them is. The titles and the Val core values that we see for each arm service honor, courage, commitment, country, duty service above self excellence. In all that we do always faithful, always prepared. These are some of the core values that we entrust in our national military leaders. And those should be the same core values that we should have in our political leaders. To be a good leader. A person has to, first of all, recognize that other people have rights and individualities that you need to take into account. You appreciate who they are and, and what's important to them. The problem arises in leadership. When you have a person who does not appreciate that others are there as independent folks, but who are there to serve you. We expect leaders to bring people together, to try to unify the country as best they can. The number of attacks that this president is making on Twitter are astronomical. And then the attacks on the media on top of that, I've never been, I really liked the Trump is an idiot. Trump is a buffoon sort of aspect of the anti-Trump rhetoric because I think it does diminish where that it should. Some of the real dangers he poses. No, he's not fit to serve. I think either by character or judgment, I don't agree with his policies. I don't think he has much experience. He doesn't know how government work works, but all that can all be tolerated or survived. But in terms of it's just basic, uh, character and judgment. Is basic sense of putting the country first, at least in key moments, you know, every politician has moments where he cuts corners and watches out for himself or herself, but the Trump, it was Trump. It's the opposite. It's a mirror. I almost think it's a miracle when he actually seems not to simply put his own narrow interests first and the recklessness and the demagoguery. So undercuts democratic norms and sort of constitutional processes that it's dangerous to the country. Why do they hate his guts? They hate his guts because he represents a threat to their status quo. It's almost, it's a very weird salad because it doesn't fit in the box of the traditional Republican establishment or the democratic party. I mean, he is a reflection of our politically correct society. If I'm not allowed to say what I'm thinking, and everyone's got me in a tight box, when I go into the voting booth, I'm going to vote for him. The more politically correct? The society is the greater, the reaction formation is of the orange man comes to town. Why I support Trump is pretty easy. He is the only president in the last, probably 40 years that has been for the people. And, you know, I had an epiphany at my first Trump rally. I tell people that it was a reconnection to my life because I grew up in a blue collar situation and I hustled my way to some dough, went to Tufts and Harvard law school. I worked at Goldman build two successful hedge fund businesses started to become independently wealthy. And then what ends up happening is you pick up the collective biases. Of the people around you. And so you don't really have a good ear to the ground. And so when I got to the first Trump rally, I crossed the security perimeter, went and started talking to people and I was like, Oh my God, Mr. Trump is talking to the people I grew up with. And these are people that are economically desperate. We went from a economically middle-class and lower middle-class working class aspirational society to a desperation, all society in 35 years. And I can explain what happened through the forces of trade and globalism and our mistakes about repositioning manufacturing away from the United States. All of those things that we did, some of it accidental, some of it intentional left a very large group of people feeling very, very desperate about their economic aspirations and their wellbeing. And so that first Trump rally, I was like, Whoa, there's a lot of people out here that are in a lot of pain and I missed it. They had the economic anxiety and they are going to vote to reject the status quo. It's a, it's an anger based vote. And, uh, you have to work on policy solutions to fix that. You have to heal that because when you create a breach in the social fabric of the society, you create a systemic rise of populism and you get all of these unintended or unexpected political outcomes. I didn't see it myself. But Trump saw it. And so that's something you have to give him credit for eras, a billionaire. So you'd have to say this is a completely out of touch dude, but he saw it. I did not see it. And I grew up with it. So take a step back. We racked up $18 trillion of debt. We killed a million people in the middle East. We wounded 70,000 service men and women, 7,000 service, men and women have died and 22 are dying a day. In the United States from suicide related to post-traumatic stress, our educational system K through 12 is completely uneven and broken. Our infrastructure completely failed and broken. We have no industrial policy. There's nobody in the United States as a public servant that has a ten-year plan. I don't even have a five-year plan. So the American population is looking at the situation and saying, wait a minute, this is not working for me. The stock market crashes. And the very big bank is about to go out of business. The government sends them a trillion dollars to protect them. What about me? And so people feel that the system is rigged and the system is unfair towards them. You call these people deplorable, white ethnocentric, white nationalists, or whatever, those like knuckle dragging misnomers, those adjectives of attack on these people. They tune you out. You'd be better served going into those areas of the country and listening to them and saying, Hey, you know what? I don't think you're a racist or you're a white trash person. I think you're a person that really just wants your family to have a better life. And as a public servant, I'm going to try to come up with policies that help you do that. David axle rusted me. Remember Anthony people will vote for somebody. They don't like they gave Richard Nixon a landslide. Nobody liked him. They gave him a landslide. If they don't like doing this, they don't like voting for people that dislike them. See the difference. So you're standing at a podium, calling people deplorable. They're like, okay, give my vote to the orange man. Let's see how he does. I think Trump speaks to people in a really very good way. He is appealing to people who are hurt. Angry. They feel bypassed, ignored and not taken seriously. The problem is that he doesn't speak to the humanity of the people who don't agree with him. They're bringing drugs, they're bringing crime, they're rapists, but building that wall and it's going up very big. If you have any racism in you. Trump's going to let you bring it out. I get to be a jerk again. I get to be 1956 America. Again, it's not a racist. There's not a racist. This guy treats everybody like shit. He is not a racist. Okay. It doesn't matter if you black, white, lesbian, transgender. He treats everybody the same. Okay. And he went to Elton John's wedding Eastland. He's an asshole. That's different from being a racist. And he's obviously an ass. It's so sad that so many people. I've let their worst side come out through Trump. Are you racing the least racist person that you have ever. I look at my African American over here. Look at him. Are you the greatest, you know what I'm talking about? I have a great relationship with the blacks. I have. I've always had a great relationship with a black, I love the old days, you know, what they used to do to guys like that when they were in a place like this, they'd be carried out on a stretcher folks. I resisted. For quite some time, the notion that he is racist, it's more a function of his narcissism than anything else. It's not really racist. That was sort of a way I viewed Trump that he doesn't like them because they oppose it. And that's really what it's about. It's all a function of his narcism. And when he kind of says things that were supportive of some of those bad people at Charlottesville, that's again a function of his narcissism because. The people who were attacking those people were attacking him. I had a group on one side that was bad. And you had a group on the other side that was also very violent. But you also had people that were very fine people on both sides. You had people in that group. Excuse me, excuse me. I saw the same pictures as you did. Awesome. You had people in that group that were there to protest the, taking down a statue, Robert Lee to them, a very, very important statute. My mother came from the Philippines. She came to the United States in the late 1950s. So I'm half Filipino. The other half is some mixture of Irish, Scottish, you know, classic American mud. I think of myself as an American and I just assume people aren't racist. And I tend to forget that well, Some people are, and that sort of the lesson with Trump is I just gave him the benefit of it. Now these are people that if they don't like it here, they can leave. But what he said about those members of Congress, it brought back that memory of the one time. I really remember. Wow. There really are people like that. Here I was with my mother. When I was a teenager in a parking lot in Massachusetts, when somebody said to her, go back to your country, sorry. And I found that to be, and it really, it came, it came home to me that this man is a racist. He is evil. Democrat party is now being led by four left-wing extremists to reject everything that we hold. Dear. he's a racist beyond any question. The first time I saw Trump at a rally. Telling the crowd that he loved them, but he also hated everybody else. When I saw him leading them in a loyalty of using emotions in that way, I realized that this was not politics as usual. Hello. Do you swear that you're going to vote for Donald Trump tomorrow? Raise that. I love you. I love you. He had talked about being president for many, many years, uh, with his advisor of the time, Steve Bannon, who is a white nationalist and unabashed racist. Steve Bannon considers himself a student of history and he likes to think that he knows. Uh, the cycles of history and in terms of resentment and racism, and in this case, he was correct. Italy in 1922, these marching men are charter members of a new Italian political party. The fascists founded and led by a flamboyant X editor ex army cop road, ex socialist, but he's almost leaning his movement numbers on million members, including uniform black shirts and miscellaneous successfully. It bosses his leadership on the Italian King on people. Despite the fact that 80% of Italians still support the constitutional monarchy is threats of violence on revolution. When him, the office of premier on his first anniversary with the aid of gunfire, kidnapping and castor oil, he is absolute dictator. At the time was Selena came on the political scene in 1919, Italy was eliminated democracy. People had to vote, women could vote and miscellany came in as a revolutionary, as a rabble rouser to completely shake things up. But one of the most crucial moments of authoritarian capture is when traditional elites. In fight. The authoritarian in the making into power fascism was a very violent movement. The political establishment. These traditional conservatives were so frightened of the continuation of the violence that they actually invited him to become prime minister. He was invited into the office and they thought that he could be contained and he would kind of do their dirty work and then they could control him and tragically. That was not to be. He attacked the press. He, he attacked, uh, democracy as something that wasn't necessary. He joked about having term limits, removed arch enemy Jack Mazziotti. The leader of the socialist party was seen being taken away by fascist thugs. Eventually his body was found, but it was a huge outrage and a special investigation was launched with a prosecutor. And in the course of this mostly needs career looked like it was over and he was being asked to resign and to end this, yes, he declared a dictatorship in January, 1925. He changed the special prosecutors. The assassins were given light prison sentences, and eventually pardoned because dictators love to pardon criminals and, uh, Italian society was never the same again. there are times in history when figures appear, who are able to coalesce existing hatreds and anxieties that exist in a culture and form from them, a movement. Through rallies through propaganda, through promises to them, we will be ending the AIDS epidemic and curing childhood cancer. Only. They know the truth only they can fix the problem. We are finally putting America first. My name is Cheryl COOs, and I'm a historian of inner war, Europe and fascism and authoritarianism. Hitler gained his followers by promising them a better life, a better Germany, but he also had a scapegoat use as diseased and foreign objects. One of the most dangerous things about authoritarian leaders is that their particular personal quirks, their obsessions, their preoccupations often become state policy. And I think one of the manifestations of that, that we've seen in policy is the zero tolerance policy immigration. Is the fault and all of the problems that we're having, you look at what's happening in Europe. You look at what's happening in other places. We can't allow that to happen to the United States. Not on my watch, the separating of children from parents. Think about the kind of mind that the, I know how we're going to restrict immigration. Let's take their children away. I mean, it's a cruel, almost cartoonishly evil kind of thing to do. Who's number one with Hispanics and Trump. It's a violation of, of human rights to take children away from their parents to be so uncaring about the, the permanent effect on these children. And it is going to be permanent is cruel and sadistic behavior. It's completely different from saying, we need to have strong borders or we need to limit immigration or something like that. Those things, if they are worth doing can be done without destroying children's lives. One institution, my opinion, that hasn't stood up to fit themselves at all our Congress and the Republican party. It's quite extraordinary that the Republican party they're slotting right into behavior in Italy, in the 1920s and Germany and early 1930s. And so on. I want to know who's the person in the game to listen to. Well, first the versus the game, then this would lower the information. Cause that's close to a five. You know what? We usually do the spies and Tracy recently handled a little bit differently. He does not believe in democracy the way he rules in the white house shows that. It reminded me of something I read by Ivana Trump, uh, when he was married to her and in their divorce proceedings, she had written that he liked reading Hitler, speeches, and Hitler speeches would always build you up to this crescendo, right. Of shouting and repeating things three times. Because if you repeat something three times, it breaks through the audience and it becomes a fat in their mind. And I want you all to know that we are fighting the fake news, fake phony fake a few days ago, I call it the fake news, the enemy of the people, and they are, they are the enemy of the people, the big lie technique that came from the Nazis. So now we're faced with the same problem. People say over and over and over again, something which has never been true. It's a lie basically, or it may be a prejudice, but when you repeat it, unless it's challenged quickly and effectively, it becomes the norm. It becomes accepted. Wisdom, even though it's completely wrong. Repeat everything three times. The third time it becomes the truth. He is capitalizing on the authoritarian. Playbook is a way that these kinds of men capture democracy. After they get power, they proceed to tame the judiciary. They attack the press and the ultimate aim is to get people to believe that reality is what they say it is. The fake news, right? They're not about the greater good and calling people to their better angels. They're about fostering sense of victimization and fear and how the nation could be pure and how the nation. Would be better without X, Y AMC elements from all our people hail victory. So is it appropriate to compare Trump to, I compare Trump to Hillary all the time, and that makes people angry. And I'm not going to stop doing it. And I'll tell you why I'm not going to stop doing it because my father was a great historian and student of Jewish history. And he used to say to me all the time, John, the meaning of history is in the Holocaust. We cannot be silent. It's not that he's as bad as him or that he's the equivalent of that, but he has the same diagnosis. He's in the same category. That it's a psychological type that can be more or less extreme, but they share these common characteristics. They're cut from the same cloth. Those of us who have been raised in this current era, we don't realize how spoiled we've been. We've been raised from the world war II, boom of prosperity to today. One of the greatest periods of peace and prosperity in human history. Um, and. We've also taken it for granted that our democracy was solid. That liberal democracy is now becoming the touchstone for the planet. That's what we believe Greg years ago, but Plato predicted thousands of years ago that democracies always ended autocracy. And we're so naive. We don't understand that every democracy is always vulnerable to being. Taken over and turned into an autocracy. We are in the third era. Of the rise of charismatic, threatening, strong men in history. The first was during the fascist period in the twenties and thirties, uh, after world war two, you had anti-colonial strong men like Mobutu and Kadafi and today we have a new crop. Of leaders who are threatening liberal democracy or have already partly destroyed it. Trump has helped autocrats all around the world. Just, I mean, almost immediately out of the box, early one in Turkey, Turkey has the right to eliminate all possible threats to its sovereignty with or without its allies. I'll CC in Egypt. Whenever there is a minority trying to impose their extremist ideology, we have to intervene regardless of their numbers. Even in Libya, they're backing the strong man I'll have Tara is most important. Aim is to take over the capital. Of course, because the one who takes over the capital is the one in power. You have presidents like both Sinero in Brazil. Now these red outcasts will be banished from our homeless. It will be a cleansing, never seen in Brazilian history. You have strong men in the Philippines, like Duterte kicked it out of mass effect 3 million years. No, there is 3 million, 3 million. I'd be happy to Vladimir Putin. Russia is actually fueling right-wing extremist governments in Europe. They're funding them AFD in Germany, alternative for Deutschland largest political party in Germany fueled mainly by hatred of liberalism in immigration. These people are all fellow travelers now. And as fellow travelers, they all believe in the same thing. And they believe that democracy is a failed experiment and that the polar axes of the world should shift. We are in a battle for our political and ideological lives. What was America is now under siege around the world. This is a dangerous, dangerous time for the world. Are we moving to a time where the 1930s have been forgotten? And people are viewing it as a template, not a warning. The only way we can perpetuate a democracy is by people sharing those values and thinking that that is something to be upheld. I mean, Trump is a symptom of a lot of things, including a rise of a kind of ethno nationalism and authoritarianism, but he's a symptom who's become a very important cause if the United States is standing against. Ethno nationalist, sentiments and authoritative and authoritarian regimes around the world. I think that puts a certain amount of check on them with the American president on their side. It's a kind of exponential shot in the arm for them and an exponential weakening of liberal democracy around the world. I actually go back to believe it or not chimpanzees. No. When Jane Goodall was observing chimpanzees, you know, one of the things showed us is how loving they were, you know, and how human they were. And she bonded with them and formed these relationships with them. And then the males would come up, Pete for dominance, you know, they pound their chest and they throw dirt up in the air and they'd throw heavy rocks. And the river to show who is more powerful, but no one ever really got hurt was all called display behavior. Just to sort of show who was the toughest and that person would become the alpha. What happened though after many years is that troop that she observed became so big that they split into two troops. So everything she taught us about chimpanzees is really what we would call within group behavior. It says nothing about between group behavior. Once the troops had split apart, a very aggressive, charismatic, alpha male from one of the groups would start beating his chest and hooting and slapping the other males and getting them excited. And then he would start marching. Towards the other group's territory and the other males would follow him and they would wait at the edge of the territory for another male, maybe even someone they were friends with when the troop was one troop and they will barrel down the Hill and beat that male to death. And they'll do that systematically until they're able to take over the other groups, females, and their land. Now think about this from an evolutionary point of view, whose genes got to move on the troop with the malignant narcissistic leaders that let's go kill all the other chimpanzees. So, this is very deep in our genetic programming, and this is why demagogues, like Trump are able to be successful because before Trump, we had fractures in our society, but we had this overarching identity as Americans, Donald Trump fractures it and says, no, we're actually two troops. And our troop is being attacked by that troop. And. If we don't go over there and beat the crap out of them, they're going to destroy us. And that is like a siren song to the deep genetic programming in the base of our animal brains. Yes. If somebody convinces us that other troopers tried to kill us and I don't care how bad my leader is, but he's the one who's leading us to the edge of the truth. So only one of us has got to survive. Who cares if he's a liar we want to survive. And the only way we survive is by attacking those other people, that primitive programming is actually not. Atypical. They're not anomalous. They're not unusual. Humankind has been at war in every place at every time. Right. And they've been horrible, you know, in war to burning down villages, raping women, torturing people, killing people. That's actually normal for the human animal. Unfortunately it's the psychology of power. We all tend to fall behind the powerful leader. Out of self preservation and out of group preservation, it's the natural instinct. What are you most fearful of about this precedent? Nuclear war? I mean, that's, that's the long term. I mean, that's, that's the biggest risk is that some, he gets in a confrontation with a foreign leader, North Korea, a worth with China. Uh, where his ego's on the line several months ago, uh, uh, a foreign policy expert on the international level went to advise Donald Trump. And three times he asked about the use of nuclear weapons. Three times T asked at one point, if we have them, why can't we use them? North Korea best not make any more threats to the United States. They will be met with fire and fury. The likes of which this world has never seen before, uh, president of the United States. Even if he's being a showman saying that we will bring fire and fury to your country. That is an implicit nuclear threat. Donald Trump does not have the temperament to be around these systems. Welcome to the white house, this ceremony and the treaty we're assigning today are both excellent examples of the rewards of patients. It was 1987 and president Reagan and Soviet leader Macau Gorbachev celebrated the intermediate range, nuclear forces treaty as calming cold war tension. The inf scrapped thousands of ground launch nuclear and conventional missiles ranges of 300 to 3,400 miles. Moscow and Washington have repeatedly accused each other of violating the treaty deal that helps to protect the security of the U S and its allies in Europe. And the far East Russia has condemned president Trump's intention to withdrawal from the pact, the deputy foreign minister saying it would be a very dangerous step. The president of the United States. Is a nuclear Monarch. He is a King, there are no safe guards other than his whim that determines when he launches an atomic bomb and where the briefcase that he has, the football is a communications device. And all it does is authenticates him to the nuclear arsenals chain of command unlock code. Enter Juliet. Papa and it executes his order. Once he has authenticated himself, Mark, not one bombs going multiple bombs are going. So when you choose that option, that missile will blow that country up in 35 minutes. And there is no turning it off once they boost into space. They're gone. The president has the authority to order a nuclear attack, including a first strike. And, uh, it is extremely unlikely, uh, that they, uh, military command would not take his order. The president can decide that France is a national security threat and he can order an ICBM strike. That's not the correct procedure. Screw that procedure. I want somebody on the goddamn phone before I killed 20 million paper. We have a launch order. Put your hand on the keys, sir. So what do you say to people who say that Trump has a bluffer he's strategic thinker. He won't do this. Are you willing to bet your children's life? Are you winning the bet, the lives of every person in this nation on it. And if you're willing to say that about any person who will have a logically lie to you to your face, documentable, quantifiable, we lie to you, your wife, your children on a daily basis, then you don't really understand what the stakes are. We cannot allow that kind of gamesmanship to continue this man controls those weapons. Don't think you can understand Trump or much else of what's going on in the world today. Without factoring in the effects of death, anxiety. Are we doing what we're doing for the reasons that we claim, or could there be something that lurks beneath the surface of consciousness in the denial of death Bakker argues that it is our awareness that we will inevitably die and our inability to accept the reality of the human condition with grace and courage. That underlies almost all human one activity pointed out as that we're animals. And we don't like that. We're breathing pieces of deprecating meat that aren't any more significant or enduring than lizards or potatoes. So if you think about it, I'm going to die. I could walk outside and get smoked by a comment. You wouldn't be able to stand up in the morning. You would literally be overwhelmed by paralyzing existential terror. What we do to bury that anxiety, to embrace belief systems that Fife has meaning, and we have value in a single word culture. So the prevailing belief in the U S in the last century is that, you know, America is the home of the free in the brave. Anybody who works hard enough can be the successful, uh, as Oprah or bill Gates or Warren buffet that we will always be the world's foremost, economic as well. As military power. And so, you know, one of the first knees in our psychological Bryan was nine 11. When both our military and economic power had been challenged, then we get clobbered with the recession. Combined with globalization combined with demographic reality that by the middle of the century, white people will be in the minority. And so for many Americans, their worldview have been completely upend. So fast forward to 2015 Donald Trump declares that he's running for president. He comes down the escalator. He's like Mexicans are rapists. I'm going to keep you safe. And I said to myself that guy's gonna win. The American dream is dead, but if I get elected president, I will bring it back bigger and better and stronger. Than ever before and we will make America great again. Thank you. Thank you, bruh. When the psychological shit hits the fan, if you'll pardon the expression and when people are economically and psychologically insecure, when somebody comes along and confidently proclaims in very simple terms. Uh, that, uh, they will keep them safe. They will make them prosper. They will bring back the good old days. That's the psychological hook. If you look at it, you know, from a detached perspective, we're really at a crossroads, the impending environmental apocalypse. Juxtapose with simmering ethnic tensions, juxtaposed with race, but it's economic inequality. Uh, and sure we have Trump magnifying. All of those difficulties. What Trump also did masterfully was to take non-existent problems and render them potentially traumatic by grotesquely overemphasizing, the danger. Once you get on board psychological, once you commit to a demagogue dish, ideal log, that puts up a fact proof screen between you and the world. Once you are fully onboard, there is no rational argument that will alter your opinion. There is always a tendency for charismatic leaders to bring out the tribal nature of humans. It is very easy to lapse into an us versus them mentality. Rationality will lose every time. Where is the red line? Where do you say, okay, Hey, no Moss. I'm not supporting this guy anymore. Where is the line? So it's obviously been crossed by many people before for me, the line would be when you look at our documents and you look at our constitution, North Korea, Russia, Venezuela has the exact same language. Go look at their constitution. They have the same flowery language related to human rights and all of that stuff. But what makes us unique is the checks and balances and the power diffusion in the construction of the government. So if Trump starts to trample on that, then I'm going to turn out, have to you can't disrupt a 243 year experiment for one dude's personnel. It has now been a week since the centers for disease control confirmed the first community transmission of coronavirus in the United States. We all have personalities. Some people are more dependent. Some people are more aggressive. It becomes pathological. When you see the whole world through a screen that makes everything fit your need. Now the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus. It's not just being manipulative. It's a fundamental, inability to not be that way in this big, vast land of ours is great country of ours. We have 240 cases. Most of those people are going to be fine. Donald Trump doesn't care about experts. So weigh in on this issue of hydroxychloroquine. What, what do you think about this and what does it need to be a fifth doctor? 15 times. He only cares about people who will tell him what he already wants to hear. He makes himself ignorant about almost everything, because he only wants to hear what he wants to hear. We have it so well under control. I mean, view this the same as the flu, when somebody sneezes, I mean, I try and bail out as much as possible, and I haven't touched my face in weeks and weeks. I miss it. And one of the most devastating things he's been doing is to emotionally train Americans, not to care about others, to extinguish, compassion, extinguish kindness in themselves. He terms it being tough. He is giving people a license to hate, uh, to provide a source of anger to go after each other. How are we all tolerating? This? Loyalty is not blind obedience unless you're supporting a demagogue. Okay. And so you don't want to ever be like that in your life. Relax. You're doing great. The Dow is now down nearly 900 points. Economists have been ramping up their projections, the virus spreading explosively, like quote, a bomb to be president. You have to exercise good judgment on behalf of the American people for their interests. I have to go back to work. Our country has to go back. Our country is based on that. I think it's going to happen pretty quickly. It's got nothing to do with the safety of the people. It's about him. It's not about the country. He spent a lot of time on Twitter today. Boasting about the excellent television ratings. His news conferences have received lately. We have Monday night football type ratings and that these are like, Bachelor finale. He's not fit because he is unable to think he could only react and attack. What do you say to Americans who are watching you right now or scared? I say that you're a terrible reporter. That's really bad reporting is unfit to be president because he cannot sing. The U S is surpassing Italy as the country. With the most fatalities, he says he wants to reopen the country with a big bang pursuing truth is to the mind like food is to the body without pursuing truth. Your psyche starves and Trump's psyche has been starving for a long time. Say, sir, what metrics you will use to make that, uh, the metrics right here. If we can hold that down between a hundred and 200,000, uh, we all together have done a very good job. I am very proud to be a precedent. Thank you very much. Thank you everybody. He's detached from reality. I mean, this is just demented. fathers always knew that a King like IRA would try to rule as a personal dictator and use the powers of the presidency to enhance or enrich himself, but they never foresaw the Senate and the judiciary might completely abdicate their responsibilities and go along with that. The natural tendency of history in many ways is towards greater liberalism and altruism. But human nature has these competing forces. And so what we're seeing now is this amazing regression, right? From where we were, we are literally going backwards. I think a century or two, we all have to do everything that we can do because our society is at risk and we could lose it all. We could lose this. Grand experiment in democracy. I think we're more than halfway there. I think people don't realize how far this has actually progressed when you're in a period of rising authoritarianism. It's very easy to get exhausted because the news comes at you like bullets from a machine gun. All of it bad. One of the best weapons against authoritarianism is protests in the street. And protests are key because not only does the leader see that he's unpopular, but even more important, his allies see that the public is actually against them. Think of what you tell your kids. You tell them to be honest, you tell them to tell the truth. Tell them don't think of yourself. Don't brag, don't trash other people to make yourself feel good. How can you support Donald Trump? How can you support somebody who centrally violates all of the things that we want them to follow? He makes no sense. It's corrosive for them. It's croesor for you. It's corrosive for the country. This is a phenomenal, phenomenal country. It's one of the most unique historical experiments in the 5,500 years of recorded history. We have to figure out a way to help people and bring them into the new world of globalization. They have to feel like they're part of the aspirational success of America. That our parents felt, I believe at our best that we have the capacity to radically reconceptualize who we are and the extent to which the wheat can accept our commonality as human beings. I think therein lies the key because then there's no one left to hate and that's not going to stop us from hating. But as Ernest Bakker, put it, maybe we can hate stuff that we should like poverty and injustice, and maybe we can then use righteous indignation to everybody's best name. Okay. okay.
