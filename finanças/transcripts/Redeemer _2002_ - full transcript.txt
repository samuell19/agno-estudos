Hearing examiner, dalesboro correctional facility. Dear sir, I am writing in regard to the possible commutation of a life sentence of inmate c.F. Henderson, prisoner number 377048. Break, let's do it. [ Knocks ] Don't move! Back up! Back up! [ Shouting ] Move! Move! Do what we tell you and we won't hurt you! Get on the floor. Come on, move! [ Shouting ] I ain't playing with you! All right, let's check upstairs! Everybody be quiet! Be quiet! Open it! Come on, let's go! Over here! Do what he says! [ Shouting ] It's all right. It's okay! It's cool. Ain't nobody else out there. Good, 'cause we're gonna have a little party. Yeah, these guys like a little party. Now I want everybody to be comfortable. Yeah. You think we should get comfortable? Yeah! Yeah! Take off your clothes. You heard me! Strip! Get 'em off! Hurry up! Do what the man says! Take that off! Yeah. See, that way nobody will leave before the party's over. Hurry up! Hurry up! Here, get these clothes. Go through all the pockets. Get all the money. All right, sit down! Sit down! [ Shrieking ] It's okay. That's it, man, that's it. This is it? All right, I got two questions, two questions. Where's the dope and where's the money? Look, what's going on? Who are you guys? Cops? I said where's the dope? Where's the money? [ Dog barks ] Calm down, boy. All right, let's check upstairs. Let's go! All right, get over here! Come here. Hold it right on 'em! Don't let nobody move! I got a bad feeling about this. Charles? Man, something ain't right here. What? Man, this don't look like no dope house to me. Look at this. Chump change. Look at this, a little bag of weed. Man, that's nothing. Hey! Look here! What the hell? Panther flag. Man, I don't get it. What are these people doing with this? [ Gunshot ] What happened? Joey! Oh, my god! What happened? I went to shut the dog up and he came at me and I shoved him back and the gun went off! Oh, my god! Oh my god! Let's go! While it's true that many years have passed since my family's tragedy, they have not reduced the emotional devastation this man has brought on US. It deprived me and my late father and mother of all the ordinary joys we might have experienced as a family. It deformed all of our expectations of life. My brother, Joey, was young and innocent not only of any wrongdoing, but of any ill will towards anyone. His death at the hands of this man and his accomplices remains an insurmountable obstacle to my happiness and peace. I am writing on this, the 20th anniversary of his death, to inform you that I remain unalterably opposed to the release to the release of this man from prison. I demand that the state adhere to the lawful sentence he received for his monstrous and unforgivable act. Signed Sharon e. Davidson. Is there anyone else who'd like to be heard? Very well. That concludes this commutation hearing for Charles f. Henderson, prisoner 377048. Thank you. Here's your I.D. Wear it in the institution at all times. Hi. Excuse me. When's Henderson getting out? Oh, I'd say 88 years from Thursday in a long box. When the next of kin stay on your case, you don't stand a chance. Anyways, I gotta go. I got another show down at coldwater this afternoon. I must say, Mr. Freeman, I can't believe our good luck in getting someone like you to teach this course. I would have thought you would want to be teaching in a university somewhere. Oh, I tried that for a while. Academia wasn't my cup of tea. And prisons are? We'll see. Attention, inmates! Because of recent thefts, the inmates' door will be closed until further notice. Thank you. [ Chuckles ] Morning. I'm Paul Freeman. Let me put that up here, Paul Freeman. And this is beginning creative writing. First thing we should do is get to know who's who here. Mr. Enriquez? You asking me? Good guess, huh? Do you mind having a seat? Yeah, sure. How's that? Mr. Filkins? No? Mr. Filkins is absent. Mr. Haines? Nice to meet you. And Mr. Henderson. All right. [ Class bell rings ] Yeah, fine, I'll call you later. I know, know. But when you get to know these people... In this class, we're gonna be doing a lot of writing. We'll begin with simple essays and then we'll move on to short stories. We'll be discussing everything from grammar to structure to verisimilitude. Say what? What did you say? Verisimilitude. It means making your writing seem true to life. Mr. Filkins? Peanut. Mr. Peanut. Would you mind having a seat? So you're a writer, huh? I try to be. Don't talk about what you try to be. What you wrote? Nothing big. I've published a couple of novels and I've got a third one that's looking for a publisher. You mean it got rejected. We got a reject for a teacher. Why am I the only one whose mom picks her up from school? I just wanted to make sure you get home safely. You don't look like much of a writer, man. You made any money? Well, you loco, man? You think he's gonna come into this hole if he's making money on the outside? Money is not a good reason to become a writer. Most of the best writers in the world can't make a living at it. If money's all you're interested in, I'd suggest you find another pursuit. Man, that's what got me in this place. Look here, Mr., uh, Freeman. I'm only in this class 'cause I wanna learn me how to write a bestseller. You know what I'm talking about? [ Laughs ] Well, that's a laugh. How's he gonna teach you something he can't even do himself yet. Can't teach US anything if you guys don't shut up! Thank you. For your first assignment, I'd like you to write about how I came to be in prison. No way! You can't ask US that kind of crap! No way! Like you to get it to the warden's office in my box by Friday morning. Today, the only thing you need to do is fill out those forms I passed out. Then you're free to go. Free to go, huh? Nice choice of words, mister. [ Police radio chatter ] [ Basketball announcer on TV ] Don't move! Back up! Take off your clothes! You heard me! Strip! Two questions, where's the dope and where's the money? I said, where's the dope and where's the money? Man, this don't look like no dope house to me. Hey! Look here! Man, something ain't right here. What the hell? Man, I don't get it. What are these people doing with this? Get down! [ Gunshot ] [ Screaming ] I told him to shut the dog up and he came at me and I shoved him back and the gun went off! Let's go! Let's go! Freeze! Hold it right there! Drop your weapons! Drop your weapons immediately! Lie down on the ground, hands behind your heads! Now! Do it now! Lie down on the ground! Now! Right now! All right, come on. [ Groans ] [ Chattering ] All right, sign here. Thank you. Morning. Morning. Look, I was wondering, would you mind autographing this for me? How'd you get a hardback? [ Chuckle ] I have my sources. What's your name? Kwasi. Quasi. Q-u-a-s-i? K-w. K-w. All right, here you go. Hang onto that. Might be worth some money someday. Mr. Haines, the assignment you turned in, it's not exactly what I asked for. Why don't you go ahead and read it? What do you mean? Out loud? Yes, out loud. Well, I thought you were the only one who was gonna read this. Sometimes when we hear our words spoken, they have a different value. Don't be shy. We can all benefit from the criticism of our colleagues. Yeah, don't be shy. Come on, man. We're your colleagues. [ Laughs ] Eldon climbed down From his Harley and checked out the chick with the blonde hair. His powerful muscles flexed underneath his black Harley Davidson t-shirt and the Aryan tattoo on his forearm bulged. The blonde took one look at him and her nostrils flared. Oh, eldon, she said, I have seen some men in my time, but never one I wanted as bad as I want you. [ Laughter ] The brunette on the back of his bike reached over and slid her hand with her hot pink fingernails down the back of his levis... Probably 'cause his butt crack is showing. [ Laughter ] You don't like my story, you don't have to listen to it! Come on, man, that's no story. That's just you shucking off. I'll show you shucking off! I'll show you shucking off! Hey, hey, hey, yo! Easy! All he's saying is you need to add that little verisimilitude thing to your story. Eldon... Why don't you shut up, huh? Gentlemen... You better sit down, boy, before I decide to get up. Peanut! Peanut! What's going on in here? All right, all right. It's okay. It's all right. It's not a bad start. Next time, I'd like you to spend a little bit more time working on your characters. I'd like to hear more about eldon's interior life, his hopes, his fears, his desires, what he thinks of at night. Mr. Henderson, I'd like to hear from you now. I'd rather not. Aw, come on. I read mine. You read your speech. It's not a speech. This is a written assignment, not an exercise in oratory. You're right. It was a written assignment. But before we wrote, we spoke. Hearing our words out loud is sometimes the best measure of their truthfulness. I always read what I write out loud. It helps me hear its flaws 'cause I don't know about you, but I make mistakes. I don't make mistakes. If you don't make mistakes, then how'd you end up in here? The written word ought to be different from the spoken word, different from talk, because the written word is premeditated like an architect's design, like first degree murder. That's where it gets its power. I agree with you. And what you wrote is a wonderful example of what this assignment was all about and that's why I want you to share it with the class. It certainly left me wanting to know more about what happened. It certainly left me wanting to know more about what happened. The darkness around them seemed alive with nameless creatures as the four men, jumpy with nerves, approached the great sleeping house. [ Door closes ] Mail's here. I don't have time to look at it right now. What are you doing? I'm rewriting this program. I have to express mail it tonight. If you keep interrupting me, I'm not gonna finish, so shoo. Something you've been waiting for. What's it say? It's good news. Hey, it's Tiffany's party tomorrow. I can go, right? You're supposed to be grounded, remember? I got home at 10:05, mom. Exactly. Five minutes late. Well, what if I promise to be home at nine tomorrow? We'll talk about it later, okay? We'll talk about it later, okay? [ Chattering ] Henderson. Hi, baby. How you doing? You look great. Yeah. So do you. What do you got? Oh, remember that book you asked for? Yeah. Aw, this is great, man. I can't get this in here. Yeah. Come on, let's sit down. Okay. No! Dad? Listen, it's not a good idea. What's the big deal? I take a semester or two off... That's not the way it's gonna happen. How do you know? I know! Just believe me, I know. You're not hearing me, dad. You're just being stubborn. I hear you. I just need to get me some money. I'm tired of mooching off mom and Stan. They got Jason and Alicia to think of. Look, I got some money saved. If it's money, I can get you that. And I'm tired of all that studying. I wanna go out in the real world. Kids do it all the time. Kids, yeah. But you're not those kids. Maybe if you were some rich white kid, that might be possible. But a young black man without direction, I'm telling you, I see the results of that in here every day. But I'm not them, I'll go back! Maybe you will and maybe you won't! Son, you got to learn to finish what you start. Kendall, what I'm trying to explain to you is that, when I was your age... You ended up in here. I'm sorry. You're right. You're just helping me make my point. Maybe if I was in school, none of this would have happened. Hey, Charles! How you doing? This your boy? Yeah. How you doing? Paul Freeman. Kendall Henderson. Kendall, your father's a heck of a writer. I asked the class to write stories about how they ended up in prison. What your father wrote was excellent. I was thinking it could be the basis for a short story. Maybe I could help you get it published. Let me make something perfectly clear. I'm not interested in exposing myself to you or a whole lot of other people that I don't know. Now if you'll excuse me, I'd like to get back to this visitation with my son unless, of course, this conversation is a class requirement. No, it's not a class requirement. I'm sorry for the interruption. All right. Nice to meet you, Kendall. See you in class. What's the story with that dude? Some writer looking for material for his next book. Hey, listen, did you talk to your mother about coming to this thing that the warden's having here? No, I haven't. Why's it matter so much? You think she'll come? [ Blues guitar ] Hey, look here! This don't look like no dope house to me. What the hell? [ Screaming ] Drop your weapons! Lie down on the ground, hands behind your head! Book man? You have any books to tell how to get out of this place? They didn't write that book yet, partner. Excuse me. Where you going, Charles? I'm going over to the geriatric block. Don't give no sexy books to them old dudes. They may get a heart attack or something. I hear you, baby. You remember what happened last week? [ Laughs ] My man, you already did that spot. Attention inmates! All those enrolled in the extension college are invited to the warden's reception Sunday at one P.M. In the exercise yard. [ Coughing ] Book man! Yeah, that's it, man. [ Coughing ] Hey, greystone. Finished with that book I gave you, man? Got it right here. Got any more books like this? How long you been reading now? About five years. You ought to know. You the one that taught me. You been reading five years. I think you should try something a little bit more challenging. I got a good one. "Tuskegee airmen". It's about the black fighter pilots from world war ii. You'd like that. Yeah. I'll bring it by for you. [ Coughing ] Sit up, sit up, sit up! All right, all right, all right, man. Now, listen, you rest easy. I gotta get back to these books here. But I'll bring that book for you. I'm sure you'll like it. Take it easy, man. Let's take as an example trini's paper. We have a woman driving down the road after a rainstorm and her car suddenly spins out of control and slides into a giant sinkhole. [ Laughs ] It's true, man. That happened to my cousin. What can we do to make this woman into a more sympathetic character? There's nothing wrong with my cousin the way she is, man. Let's just pretend that she's not your cousin. She's our character. We can do anything we want with her. Shoot, I know what I'd like to do to her. Look, don't you talk about my cousin like that. If I'd get my hands on her. Shut your mouth! What can we do to make this character more sympathetic to the reader, hmm? Think for a second. What can we do to raise the stakes, to make this a more dramatic situation? Kids. What? Put a couple of kids in the car. Good. What else? Say one of the kids was real sick. She doesn't have any kids, man. And she was on her way to the hospital. No, no! The kid isn't sick. Her old man beat the kid up. There ain't no old man, man. If there was, he wouldn't be beating her like your mama beat you. This is a pretend character. She was worrying about some big old truck that would come along and fall on top of her. Come on, man. Nobody has that kind of bad luck. Yeah, and the hole is filling up with water. No. Don't need any of that disaster stuff. There's more than enough drama if she's a single mother who just got kicked off welfare. She got two kids. One of the kids is sick. She's taking him to the hospital. She knows she doesn't have any insurance, okay? Car falls into a sinkhole and here you are. She's sitting there wondering what else could go wrong. Good. And that's when the rain starts to come in like a monsoon. Am I right? And she's trying to drag those kids out of there before they drown. Is that what you want? Yeah, then the water's raising up. It's up to her neck. All right, all right, good. New sheets of paper. Hey, man. What's an oxymoron? Hey, Charles? I reread what you wrote about the shooting that night and I was just wondering how is it that the police were waiting for you when you left the house? It was an assignment, right? Yes. And I fulfilled it, right? Admirably. That's all I gotta say about it. That's all I gotta say about it. Yes, it is an unusual place for a family event like this inside the prison walls, but, uh, we like to incentivize our inmates... Warden? Get them to see that taking classes can have benefits. Our philosophy is this simple. Excuse me, sir. [ Laughs ] My god! Look at you! Man, look at you. Hey, you remember my son, Kendall. Course I do. Look at you. Hello, there. And you remember Cynthia. How you doing, girl? Hey, des. Nice to see you again. You remember him? Yeah. So how are you? I'm good. I'm really good. Doesn't she look wonderful? I'm really doing good. I'm really glad to see Cynthia. Come on! Hey, y'all look kind of empty. Why don't I get y'all something to drink? Okay, great, man. Thanks. Here, take a look at this one. He didn't see this one. Well, it's not every day you see a tea party in a prison. Mom, this is dad's writing teacher. Oh, hi. I'm Kendall's mother, Cynthia dobbs. It's very nice to meet you. Paul Freeman. Mind if I join you? No, not at all. Hey, man, do you think it's stupid for a guy to take a little break from school? Do something else and come back and finish up? Charles is dead set against his dropping out. I'm not dropping out. Yeah, right. Well, I guess it all depends on the person. I did. Oh, yeah? Yeah, my sophomore year. I took a job on a freighter, sailed around the Great Lakes for a year and a half. See? Thanks, des. Hey, man. I learned a lot of things that you can't learn in school. There it is! Mostly, how important it is to get an education. There it is. Hi. Paul Freeman. Desmond. Man, this is like a conspiracy. What's wrong with going out there and doing something real? Man, you're standing in the middle of real. This ain't everybody's reality. Well, it used to be mine. Well, it doesn't have to be mine. Listen, you can't blame your daddy for wanting you to stay in college. I mean, he never had the chance. This here was our college. I mean, we all got really screwed over good. Your daddy and I, we were fighting for a good cause. As a committed member of the black panther party, I have the following statement in support of the four brothers who went down for the cause. The issue is the political prisoners of america and people as one to stand for the release of all political prisoners. The black panther party is the peoples' party and we are primarily interested in freeing man. Black power! Black power! Black power! Ain't no whites allowed... It's all right. Let them in. I want them to hear what I have to say. Come on up here. Come on. Sit right here. Two seats reserved for you. The four brothers arrested last night ain't no hoodlums. They been going down into the dope houses in the dead of night taking the dope man's money and flushing that evil stuff he sells down the toilet where it belongs. And we've been putting that money to better use. You all been to our free breakfast program? Well, those kids are being fed by the dope man's dollar. Now you take that and put it on your damn front page! Just make sure you send it to the post office box and not my pad. I'll take care of it. You did real good, Jake. We got these guys nailed right down the line. Too bad about the kid who got himself shot in the head. Price of success, I guess. Hey, you're cold, wit, real cold. I mean, you have to understand what we were fighting for. I mean, Malcolm X, Martin Luther King had just been murdered. Peaceful demonstration wasn't doing a damn thing. I mean, we just have to do something! Des, it's okay. Teaching in a prison? That's a new extreme even for you. I need the money. We both know what comes first and foremost with you. You do. I'm in over my head, it's true. I thought I'll teach a class at the prison, get some inspiration, an idea for a new novel. But what I found is a guy, a black panther, who doesn't deserve to be in prison. I don't know what to do. Well, maybe if you help this person, you'll find a way to help yourself, too. Well, there's nothing wrong with me that being back with you wouldn't fix. You're so wrong about that. What should I do? You decide. Attention staff and inmates of "a" block. Yard time commences in exactly 15 minutes. Inmates not in the yard by then... And why is that? Number one, I think it was a setup, the cops, the FBI, I'm not sure. Number two, the guys that were with Charles aren't even in prison. And number three, the guy that pulled the trigger is even out. Don't you think that's odd? Mr. Freeman, there are 1,300 inmates in this institution. I can't get caught up in the details of every case. My job is to make sure they're safely locked away until they've done their time. And, believe me, that takes up every minute of my day. What about the lawyer that represented Charles? Is he still around? I'm sure it's in the court records somewhere. Why are you so interested? If you knew a guy was in your prison unfairly, wouldn't you want to do something about it? Hey, check out this pretty boy. Hey, nice car. In here. Paul Freeman. To what do I owe this honor? Well, an old client, Charles Henderson. You going to write a book about Charles? Maybe. Or maybe a book about the hardworking public defender who represented him. That's ancient history. Please sit down. I try to keep in touch with him, but it's been a long time. You know, what I don't understand is how he got life without parole for what he did. Those were very difficult times. There weren't many of US who'd take cases involving the black panthers, you know. It wasn't considered to be helpful to your career. Yeah. Knowing him now, it's hard to believe that he would have ever done something so stupid. It wasn't stupid, Mr. Freeman. Not to him, not back then. It's 45 minutes 'til my lunchtime. I hate being late for lunch. A rare occurrence, I'm guessing. From your girlfriend. She had the baby. You have a son, my friend. Damn! All shriveled up! Got a name for him yet? Uh, Kenneth, I think. Or Kendall. It's in the letter. Okay, my friend, you've had some time to think. What's it gonna be? Man, I already told you. No. I came out here today to hear something sensible. Look, man. Sensible is not pleading guilty to some murder when I ain't killed nobody. Charles, you gotta take the deal while the prosecutor's still offering it. Second degree. You go in, you stay clean, you done in 10 years, maybe 8. That ain't right, man. Let me lay it out for you one more time. In this state, we have felony murder law-- man, I heard all that before. If you commit a felony and somebody dies while you're doing it, even if they just drop dead of a heart attack, you are guilty of felony murder! But I didn't kill nobody! The penalty is life in prison, no parole ever. Look, man, I'm not copping no plea, okay? Word is bond. Now if they want to lock me up, hey, let 'em lock me up. Desmond, Sam and Albert all pled out on my advice. They'll do their 8 or 10. That's them. That's not me, okay? Now I didn't kill nobody and a jury should be able to see that. It's not gonna make a difference. Do you want to end up in prison for the rest of your life? I ain't afraid of prison, man, 'cause prison ain't nothing but another way the system has of oppressing the cream of the young black manhood. You may be surprised at how quickly that cream curdles, young man. Oh, nowadays Charles couldn't get life for what he did. He'd have to go into that house with the intention of killing somebody. Unfortunately, the new law isn't retroactive. What is it that you want exactly? I was hoping to find some of the people who were involved, maybe some of the arresting officers. One of the detectives on the case was a man named Witkowski. Witkowski. Yeah. Retired as an inspector. You should be able to find him. Yeah? What about the sister of the kid who died? No. You're on your own there. I can't... I won't help you. There's victim protection laws. Excuse me. Be right back. Are you crazy? You got the nerve to call me and tell me some garbage like that, man? [ Laughs ] You just wait, wait 'til I get out! [ Chattering ] Des, don't do nothing stupid, man. Look, whatever happens, man, you don't wanna end up back in here, right? Man, it's hard. Desmond? You're staying away from that dope, right? Oh, man, I ain't ever seen so much dope around, dope, guns. But I'm clean, man. That's god's own truth. Good. I'm glad to hear that, man. Hey, listen. As far as your boss goes, when he...Hello? [ Dial tone ] Hello? Hello? Time's up, Henderson. [ Dog barks ] Of course, I remember. I remember every case I ever worked. Why are you so interested? Well, it's such a dramatic case and you played such an important role, inspector. Are you his lawyer? No. I'm just a writer. What do you say? Hey, what is say is this is gonna be one hell of a day. Gentlemen? I warned you about this, didn't I? Didn't I, huh? Sit down. Get your hands off me. Go sit down over there. Come on. Morning, wit. You're late. I had to stop by the feds so they could chew me out. Jerks. Man, that's no way to talk about the FBI. Don't you know j. Edgar and his boys never make a mistake? [ Telephone rings ] I must have forgot. Detective bureau. Yeah. Wait a minute. It's your boy Jake. Jake. Witkowski here. Yeah? Yeah? 1585 Jefferson tonight. Jake, if we go out there and this thing doesn't come off, I am not gonna be a happy man. Oh, it's gonna go down, detective. I made damn sure of that. Gotta split. Later. Let's tip. 1585 Jefferson? Man, we were watching that place. Bunch of long-haired Vietnam hippies living there. Well, tonight they're gonna be raided by the black panthers. J. Edgar had a real hard time with the panthers. He liked to set them against other left-wing groups to isolate them. We had orders to cooperate. Connolly, turn your lights off 'til I say so. Got it, commander. Come on, let's do it. Nobody wanted anybody dead. But the black panthers were unpredictable. Is this guy Jake still around? Jake, Ben. Real name, Trevor denby. He runs security at one of the big truck farms down by the airport. We almost nailed him on a big drug deal a few years ago. That's the kind of scum that was in the black panthers. Charles Henderson isn't scum. I think you know that what's happened to him isn't fair. You weren't there. How can you talk about fair? You're being conned by a no-good piece of crap lifer who's trying to save his ass. Go screw yourself. Get the hell out of here. Thanks for your time. [ Shouting ] [ Laughs ] Yo, it's game point, y'all! Why don't you come run with US, man? Show you how the big boys get down. No, you go ahead. Ball, peanut! You all right, man? Yeah, I'm fine. You don't look all right. Today's my anniversary, man. I been in here 20 years, 20 years. I see what you're saying, man. I been here six years myself. When you get out? 1 year, 2 months and 13 days, but who's counting? That's like tomorrow. Don't feel like tomorrow to me, man. Most times, I don't even know if I'm gonna make it. You'll make it. You got to. Hey, peanut! Come on, man! Get back over here! All right, all right! I'm coming. You hold on now. You'll make it too, man. Yeah, through that doorway. You can't miss it. The one on the left, all right? Oh, yeah. I remember Charles Henderson. It's too bad what happened to him. You do the crime, you gotta do the time. There's no more to be said. Well, I think there is. I read the police reports. Talked to a few of the officers that were there. I think it was a setup. Oh, you do, do you? It was an informer, a traitor. Why don't you tell me your side of the story? What happened that night, Ben? Or is it Jake? It's Trevor. Mr. Denby? What? Cops called. They caught them two guys that broke in here last month. Good. Those punks are lucky the law got 'em before I did. Run down and get me a copy of the report. I know it was a long time ago, but if the truth came out, it might help Charles. There's only one truth that matters. The past is the past! And neither you or anybody else gonna mess with mine. [ Grunts ] Don't mess with my past! [ Grunts ] Don't mess with my past! You're insane. You're absolutely insane. I just wanted to push his buttons, you know? See how he'd react. Can you imagine if he'd agreed to tell? What a story. These are not characters in some novel. They're people. They can hurt you and you can hurt them. Ow! I'm glad you called me, but I have to go. Wait. I don't think I should be left alone. I might have a concussion. Somebody's gotta wake me every couple of hours. Call me tomorrow and let me know how you're doing, assuming you're alive, of course. Bye. Bye. [ Playing electric guitar ] [ Banging ] Hey! Turn that down! What the hell's wrong with you? We're trying to sleep! [ Turns up music ] [ Banging ] [ Turns up music ] [ Banging ] Come on, man. You blind or something? It's up here. [ Door opens ] Peanut, will you do me A favor and hand these out? What happened to you, man? You look like you done French-kissed a mack truck or something. I had a little accident. Looks like you ran into a door. [ Laughs ] Like you ran into it two or three times, if you ask me. Ellsworth has his revision of the motorcycle scene. Would you read it? After the bad asses pulled into the gravel parking lot at the fairgrounds, eldon stopped to listen to the coughing and the snorting of the harleys all around him. They sound like animals, hungry for their feed, he thought. Since this was the biggest Harley Davidson rally in the state, eldon knew that this might be his day. Eldon watched as she came out of the bar. The big biker laughed as he put his arm around her waist. All eldon ever wanted was a woman of his own. She was his dream, but it seemed like his dream was always riding off on somebody else's bike. That enough verisimilitude for you? Very good, ellsworth. By opening up and exposing your characters, you've made them more human. We can now see that eldon has the same hopes and desires that we all share. Good work. Attention inmates! Because of recent disorderliness at intramural basketball games, no spectators... I thought you should know. [ Chuckles ] So that's supposed to be news to me? Man, I knew about Ben from day one. Knew about Ben, knew about Witkowski, knew about the setup. My question to you is why you digging into my past? Why you sticking your nose in my business, huh? Come in here masquerading like a schoolteacher when the truth of the matter is, is all you're doing is looking for a subject for your next book. Well, I ain't it. See, I know who you are. National bestseller. International. You're right. I did come in here looking for a story, something cheap and tawdry, something that sells. I never expected to find this. [ Kids playing ] [ Radio chatter ] [ Kids laughing ] [ Knocks ] Yes? Sharon Davidson? Yes? Hi. I'm Paul Freeman. I'm a teacher. I have a student I'd like to discuss with you. Alana? No. It's, uh... His name's Charles Henderson. Oh, sorry. I don't know any... Oh, my god. Please don't be alarmed. How did you find me? I was hoping that we could just... How did you find me? The game's been changed to 10 A.M. Saturday morning at school. Go back inside, sweetheart, okay? Okay. I don't have anything to say about that person. I've gotten to know Charles. He's a pretty decent man. Don't tell me what a decent man he is. That decent man has blood on his hands, my brother's blood! My brother was a decent man! Mrs. Davidson. Go away. Please, I was hoping to... No! Go away. Okay, I'm calling security. [ Locks door ] Attention staff. The warden's morale survey questionnaires are due in the warden's office today. Now here, see? Oh, I see. You look through this index here and you'll be able to find what you're looking for. All right, talk to you later. Hey. You looking for greystone? Yeah. He's in there. Don't make him talk too much. He's not feeling so good. Hey. Hey, what you doing here? I'm tracking overdue books. Looks like I just can't away from a life of crime. Hey, man. What do you think about these tuskegee airmen? They're good. Like I told you, I wants me another book of them buffalo soldiers. You look good. Feeling better? Yeah. Them drugs make you think you're feeling good even though you know you ain't. What about your people? You been talking to them? Ain't nobody coming to take these sorry ass bones when I go. Hey, don't go talk like that, greystone. You're not gonna die. The hell I ain't! Hell, we all ain't. You have to go now. I gotta give him his meds. All right. Before I go, I got a little surprise for you. It's another book I want you to read. It's called "the buffalo soldiers". Power to the people. Right on. You stay strong. Yo. He just appeared out of nowhere, really shook me up. He tried to tell me what a decent man the killer is. Can you imagine that? A decent man. I know what he's trying to do. He's trying to get him released. Over my dead body. Look, Sharon, I've been thinking. I don't think I can go to that guy's hearings anymore. I mean, you know, you can keep sending your letters if you need to, but Gail and I, we both feel that... You were there. You saw him die. And at the first hearing when I saw him, I mean, I absolutely hated him. It all came rushing back. But the last couple of times, I don't know. I just don't have the heart for it anymore. As horrible as it was, it was an accident. Yes, those men were responsible, but he's paid his price. He's been in prison long enough. You're my allies. No, Sharon. We're your friends. I have to go. Sharon... [ Screams ] [ Chattering ] [ Whistle blowing ] [ Laughing, shouting ] Charles Henderson wrote an essay about how he ended up in prison. How touching. If you read it, you might actually find that it is. No, thank you. I don't have a lot of empathy for murderers. My brother is dead and, no matter how touching your convict story is, it won't bring him back. Keeping Charles in prison won't bring back your brother either. My memories are the only thing keeping Joey alive. He could have been a musician, could have been a teacher. He never had the chance to become anything, all thanks to your convict. He left my brother bleeding to death on the floor. [ Dog barking ] Shut the dog up before I blow her away! It's a he, not a she. I don't care what it is! Shut him up! Get down! Get down now! Calm down! [ Shouting ] Get down! [ Gunshot ] Joey! All right, what's going on in here? Joey? What happened? What happened? I told him to shut the dog up and he came at me and I shoved him back and the gun went off! Call an ambulance! I ain't calling no ambulance! Man's already dead! Besides, there ain't no phone line. I cut 'em! My god, this ain't good! We gotta go, man! Let's go! Let's go! I ain't going nowhere. We ain't going nowhere 'til we search this house. Orders are orders. All right, man. Let's make it quick! Come on. Let's go, man. How do you know they cut the phone lines? How do you know they didn't leave right away? Two of my best friends were there that night. Besides, it all came out in the trial. [ Clapping, cheering ] [ Whistle blows ] [ Crying ] Let's go. You know that the other three guys have been out for a long time. They should all be in jail. One is better than none at all. I'm so happy! Hey, sweetheart, congratulations. Thanks, mom. Quite a game-saving tackle. Thanks. We gotta go. I'm gonna be late for Jennifer's party. Let's go. Bye. [ Chattering ] Stick to the facts, Charles. It's not what you wrote. Hey, man, look. I don't have to defend myself to you! You don't know what it's like to be a black man in this country! Don't blame it on being black. It has nothing to do with being black. Like hell it doesn't. You can't go around killing people 'cause they don't agree with how you think. That's not what we were about, man. No? What were you about? You stuck guns in peoples' faces. You cut phone lines. A man laid on the ground and bled to death while you and your buddies searched the house for drugs and money! Hey, look, man! We always cut the phone lines when we went into a dope house, okay? It was procedure! And as far as that kid goes, man, it was an accident! When I got downstairs, he was already dead. You understand that? He took a bullet in the head, man, okay? He took a bullet in the head! So phone lines or no phone lines, it wasn't nothing that I or anybody else was gonna be able to do to change when it already had happened! You don't know what we were up against! A bunch of unarmed college kids. Well, we didn't know that, man! We thought we were going into a dope house! And in those houses, it was dangerous. Them people had guns. Don't you understand that? Now you make it sound like you're the victim. You weren't! Hey, look, man! I didn't kill anybody! You think I don't think about that kid, hmm? I see that whole scene, man, every night when I close my eyes to go to sleep for 20 years! You don't think I'd do anything to get that bullet back? [ Crying ] Why don't you Write her a letter? Write who a letter? His sister. If she wouldn't listen to you, why would she listen to me? It's worth a shot. Or can't you bring yourself to apologize? [ Chattering ] [ Buzzer ] How's your letter coming? Not good. Man, I know what it is I wanna say to this woman, but it's all dammed up in my head. Ever happen to you? Yes. But you can't think about that. You just gotta find a way to write from your heart. Here, I got something for you. This was my first love. She's slow, but she's honest. There's no memory, no spell-check, no electricity, but she won't ever crash on you. All you gotta do is change her ribbon every 100,000 words. I always wondered what you had in this black box. Thanks. Good luck. I'm gonna take off. Go over to the rec room. Dear Mrs. Davidson, for more than two weeks, I have struggled with what to write in this letter. But I finally realized that what I want to say is simple and can be stated briefly. I do not offer an apology for my involvement in the death of your brother, Joseph, because... Because no apology could be adequate to your suffering. I do, however, ask for your forgiveness. Some African religions believe that the dead continue to influence the living. I want you to know that not a day has gone by since your brother died that he has not dwelled in me. For 20 years, I have tried to atone for what I did in the only way I could. I have tried to erect my own monument to Joseph and that monument is the better man I have tried to become. I am told you have a daughter. I also have a child, a son born after I went to prison. I was never able to watch him play or help him with his homework or tuck him into bed at night and now he's a man. In the time that I have been in here, my mother has died and my father has grown old and sick. Mrs. Davidson, I yearn for my long imprisonment to come to an end. If you can find it in your heart to support me in this, I will be grateful to you until the day that I am myself called to join Joseph in what I hope is finally a place of peace for all. Sincerely, Charles Henderson. Any word yet? 49 days and nothing. 20 years, man, I've been trying to show these people that I deserve my freedom, and nothing. I'm still here in this hell hole and now my only hope is some woman, a woman I don't even know, to show me some mercy? Every year, I go to that hearing and I express my remorse. What is the limit, man? There's a limit to how much I can apologize to you, to her or anybody else! [ Sighs ] Thanks for meeting me. No problem. You look kind of beat. Yeah. Up all night cramming. Midterms. That should make your father happy. Listen. I got a proposition for you, Kendall. You know the woman who writes the letters to the parole board? I want you to see her with me. Aw, man. A person died because your father was fighting the system the best way he knew how, there's a lot of people who were put in danger. I don't agree with him or anyone who uses violence to be heard, but I admire the man that I've come to know and I think that you are the best example of what he was fighting for. You want to help him, right? I don't wanna talk to her. It might make a difference. It might make a big difference. But facing her? I can't. I mean, what if I go there and the one chance I have to help dad, what if I fail? I'd always feel like I'm the one who kept him in prison. I can't. You better get outta here, man, before they lock you up, too. [ Laughs ] Looks like they're throwing me out. I'll see you. Nope. The other way. Hey, teach! Hey. Hi, ellsworth. I wanna tell you that I'm getting transferred outta here. Where to? Coldwater. It's a toilet. That's a shame. Your writing was getting better day by day. Yeah, well. That was one thing I had to look forward to every week even with those other punks in there. I was kind of living for it, you know. You can write in coldwater. You can write anywhere you want. Give you my address and my home phone number. Keep writing. Send me what you write. Call me collect. We'll discuss it just like we do in class. Hey, thanks, teach. You look after yourself now. You look after yourself, ellsworth. Yeah. See you. [ Screaming on TV ] Please turn that off. Alana? Please turn that off. Going to bed. Alana? Alana? Alana, I am upset by the violence they show. They make it seem so unimportant, as if it has no consequences. Mom... Sweetheart, I just want to protect you from all of that. Mom, I'm going into high school soon. You can't protect me from everything. I feel like I'm in jail or something. You gotta let me out. I feel like I can't breath sometimes. I feel like I can't breath sometimes. You nervous? Yeah. Kendall's studying in sociology, right? Sociology, right. I loved sosh. Did you take any? No. What did you study? Computer science. I wonder if we might have some coffee? Of course. I'm sorry. I'll make some. Oh, man. I know he still feels this attachment to mom and it's hard sometimes 'cause Stan... That's my stepdad... He's a good guy. Mom... This is my daughter, Alana. Hi. Hi. Oh, you play soccer, huh? Yeah. What position? Forward. Oh, you heard of claremont high? Yeah. They were state champs a couple of years ago. I was goalie on that team. No way. Man, I hated forwards. You play in college? No. At that level, those guys are solid. Well, I gotta go take a shower. Excuse me. Cute kid. You don't mind if I help myself to some more coffee, do you? You don't mind if I help myself to some more coffee, do you? How often do you visit your father in prison? Oh, I go as much as I can. I been doing it my whole life since I was a baby. Strange now 'cause I'm starting to do things he never got to before he went in 'cause he was too young, like go to college. I think a lot about the things that my brother was never able to do. I asked my dad once what it was like knowing he played a role in somebody dying. What'd he say? He believes that Mr.... Your brother, he's still alive as long as he still thinks about him. It's an African religion thing. In judaism, the only afterlife that we have is in the memory of others. That's why remembering is so important to US. Go ahead. I'll be right there. Okay. Thanks for the coffee. It was very nice meeting you. You, too. I read the letter. What did you think? Bringing his son over here was gonna make a difference? He's a very nice young man. What do you want me to say? It doesn't change anything. Life is change. I'll write that down. You know, I think I'm starting to understand you. You're in prison as much as Charles is. You both deserve to be let out. [ Chattering ] Hey, man, who's that? It's greystone. He died night before last. 49 years in the joint and now they're gonna Bury him in a prison cemetery, graveyard within a graveyard. Some guys never get out, huh? [ Laughs ] Sometimes I wonder if there's anything after death. Nah, just sleep, man, just sleep. Seems like it ought to be more after all you go through in life. So long, brother man. All right, ladies and gentlemen. If you'll kindly take your seats, we'll begin the proceedings in the matter of prisoner number 377048, Charles f. Henderson, currently serving life without parole petitioning the governor for commutation of sentence. Under the law, anyone here may speak. Mr. Henderson, do you have a statement? Yes. I have been in prison for 20 years and my punishment has been harsh. But I know it doesn't compare to how Joseph Davidson's family has suffered because of my involvement in his death. Since his death, I have learned to be a better man and while I have spent a lot of time in prison, prison has spent very little time in me. I would like to ask the governor to Grant me my freedom. I can assure him that I will not leave here a bitter man, but a better man. Thank you, Mr. Henderson. Is there anyone else who'd like to be heard? Now I ain't nobody. I wash dishes for a living. But this man right here, he saved my life. He got me off the dope when I was in the joint. He helped me to live clean. Even now I look to him for support and strength. Your honor, I was with Charles the night that man died and I feel real, real sorry for it. But I also feel real bad that Charles has been in here for all these years while I'm free. The fact is, Charles Henderson remains incarcerated today because a bad law wasn't thrown out soon enough. Under current law, Mr. Henderson would have been released long ago. Unfortunately, the new law isn't retroactive, so Mr. Henderson stays in jail. The commutation of his sentence is a matter of simple equity. I was raised in a house with my mother and stepfather. My dad has always been the main guiding force in my life. Ever since I was little, as soon as my mother could read them to me, he sent me letters, at least one a week, encouraging me, teaching me how to proud of myself and be somebody. He managed to be a better dad behind prison walls than most men who are with their kids every day. Is there anyone else? Then we'll close this matter...Yes, ma'am? My name is Sharon e.... Ma'am, could you please come forward? My name is Sharon e. Davidson. For a long time, I have opposed the release of Charles Henderson. Not long ago, I received a letter from Mr. Henderson in which he asked for my forgiveness. I asked myself what Joey would do. I imagined talking to him about it. And I finally realized that, if my brother were here now, he would want Mr. Henderson to be free. What I'm asking today, I'm asking in honor of my brother, but I'm also asking for Kendall Henderson and for my daughter. As someone pointed out to me, I have been in a kind of prison, too. So I am asking governor Colton to please release Mr. Henderson from his long imprisonment. It's time that we all started living again. It's time that we all started living again. Is there anyone else who'd like to be heard? Then I officially close this commutation hearing. Mr. Henderson, you'll be made aware of the decision shortly. Thank you. Mrs. Davidson? I didn't think you'd come. I didn't know that I would come myself. I'm glad you did. Thanks. [ Buzzer ] Yo, Mr. C.! You see the newspaper? Not today. Hey, Henderson, you're famous. Yo, Charles! Charles, man. Wait up, man. You're walking so fast, man. Have you seen this? Check this out. I'm gonna read it for you. "A stirring tale of forgiveness. Is governor Colton listening? By Paul Freeman." That's the teach! In a place of confinement, a tale of personal liberation unfolded Tuesday involving a man in prison for the rest of his life and a woman with more reason than anyone to keep him there. That's some nice prose, baby, by the teach. It's got that verisimilitude. You know what I'm talking about? Yeah. Hey, can I have this? Oh, yeah! Thanks. Hey, what's happening, goose? 'Sup. What was that all about? You didn't see the papers this morning? No. Man, you don't read the papers? You got to read the papers every day! Trying to learn you something for real. Trying to learn you something for real. This way. Don't forget the book you promised me, now. I'll see if I can get it for you. Hey, what did I do? Commit some kind of really bad grammatical error? Charles, come in here. Have a seat. I hope I didn't interrupt your work. No. I can get back to it soon as I...You know, when I get back. Good, good. Charles, how well do you think the library will run without you? Getting transferred again? Yeah, in a manner of speaking, yes. The governor signed this this morning. It's an order commuting your sentence to time served plus four years parole. You're getting out, Charles. [ Laughs ] Yeah, man. On the gate. [ Buzzer ] Hey. Where's the rest of your stuff? Oh, I gave it away. It's kind of a tradition you do when a guy gets out. You gave away my typewriter? Gotcha. [ Laughs ] Here you go, man. Charles, one more thing before you go. You gotta sign out. You mean, after all these years, all I had to do was come down here and sign out? [ Laughs ] Good luck. Thank you. Let's do it! I guess you got one hell of a story to tell now, huh? Yeah. I don't think I should be the one to tell it, though. You do it. Thank you. Thanks, man. Thank you, thank you. I got a class to teach. I'm gonna be late. I'll see you. I'll see you. Got a nice warm day, dad. Come on. Good luck, Henderson!
