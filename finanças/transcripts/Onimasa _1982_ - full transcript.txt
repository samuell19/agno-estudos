Toei Summer, 1940 Kyoto: Hashimoto red light district Don't push. Excuse me... excuse me... Please let me through. - Who are you? - I am an acquaintance. I'd say she died only a few hours ago. She appears to have had a miscarriage. Where's the husband? Yes. According to the neighbors, she was involved with many men. I see. Hana-chan... You know her? Yes. What's your relationship to her? She's my younger sister. Younger sister? What's her name? Kiryuin hanako. "Kiryuin?" how is that written? "Oni" with "ryu,” as in "ryu-go-Jo"... «.."in" is the "in" that is used in monastic names. And... As for "Hana" as for "Hana" it's the "Hana" that means flowers. I was adopted into the kiryuin household the year before hanako was born. It was Autumn of 1918.

Shut up. Lay off. I said, be still. Hey! What are we going to do? Well... Hiraku is still so immature. But he might become boss onimasa's heir. If he's going to amount to anything, he'll need intense training from the boss. But... the boss is just a yakuza, after all. For outsiders like us to do business in this town... A strong supporter is needed, no matter how you look at it. Zenshichi-San. The boss and the madam are here. Okay. Which kid are you giving me? Yes sir, yes sir, excuse me. This is the one. Come on, up. Up, up. I'm not going to eat you. You don't have to be so scared. Say. While I'm at it, why don't we take a girl as well? Th... this one here? Uta! What about this one? Look at her, she looks smart. She's the best kid you've got. I like her. It's decided, so no sense waiting. I'll come and get you tomorrow. I've brought them. Yeah. There you are. - What's the matter? - Hiraku. Come on, hurry and get up. Come in. = hurry. Stand up. Sign/lantern: "Kiryuin" You're here. Welcome! Come over here. Come here. Hurry, come here. What's the matter? Don't be scared. Come on. What's the matter? Boss. I brought the kids. Hey, you're here. Hey. Everybody, come here for a sec. Yes. Hey, the boss wants us. Hurry up and come here. Yes. The curve of this blade is superb. Have it sharpened. Yes. Thank you. You're an unrivaled connoisseur, boss. You made my trip from Kyoto worthwhile. They are hiraku and matsue, my new adoptees. Get used to them fast... And treat them well. Nice meeting you. Everyone... This is ma-chan and hiraki-chan. They joined our family today. Look out for them. Nice meeting you. Alright then... come on in. Over here. Come here, hurry. This will be your room. There's no electricity in here yet, so it's inconvenient, but cleaning the room... And cleaning the lamp, are two chores you will have to do. Alright? If you're having trouble, you just come and talk to your uncle here. Okay? Matsue... you're going to be in charge of tending to me from now on. Understood? What's your answer? Say, "yes, father." Say it! Yes, father. Tell Botan to be ready tonight. Sir, shall I proceed? Goodbye. B... b... Botan... Good job. M... m... miss... S... s... supper. Hey, both of you must be hungry. Hang in there, it won't be long. I'll give you plenty to eat. Just wait right here. What's the matter? I don't like boys who are crybabies. You can't run away. You can't... Understand? Hiraku? Where are you? Where are you, hiraku? Where did you go, hiraku? I sincerely apologize... Boss, if you abandon us, we will have to hang ourselves. Yes sir. Matsue... understand? Be a good girl, for hiraku's sake too. If you do, the boss and the madam will come to love you. Alright? I understand. Alright... Excuse me. Excuse me. Matsue. I'm going to take you to see something nice today. What's your answer? Don't you want to go? L... have to go to school. School? Ditch it. Ditch it. Education only messes girls up. Matsue... This is what battles are all about. Watch carefully. Understand? Yes. The first dog to enter... Is boss suenaga's national yokozuna grand-champion, "tosa storm." What do you think? Today's fight is going to be interesting. Really. Tosa storm's going to win. The next dog to enter is a high- ranking maegashira, "sea god." Get him! Get him! - Man, poor thing, he doesn't stand a chance. - Get him! A maegashira's no match for a yokozuna. He's going to get killed. Sea god's going to win. I can tell by the glint in his eyes. Sea god's going to get a gold star. He won. He did it. He won. Sea god won. The victory goes to sea god. He won. Sea god won. How about that... it was just as I predicted, wasn't it? Hold everything! I object to that fight! Suenaga-San, to what do you object? I saw it. That young mutt tricked tosa storm. Right. I saw it too. There's no way tosa storm could lose to a mutt like that. - I saw it too. - That's right. Why you! Stop your dirty accusations! - Sea god won by skill. - That's right. Fighting dogs win by skill, not strength. That's nonsense! Hey you. This isn't over yet. - That's right, it's not over. - You're a sore loser, shut up! - Or do you want to fight the dog yourself? - Hold it. Hold it! Hold it there... I am onimasa of kutanda. No matter how you look at it, there's no way you can win. I understand how you must feel... But you'd better quiet down and back off. - That's right. - That's right. What did you say? Shut up. Shut up. Well, well... A broad with real spirit. You know shit about dog-fighting. Shut your trap! Be it beasts, or men. A fight's a fight. I, onimasa, assuredly saw sea god win. Where were you looking? What are you talking about? If you must have it your way, no matter what, I'll take you on. Is that what you want? Bring it on. Bring on a fight, I'll take you on. Stop it, akio. Stop it, for crying out loud. Onimasa-San. Out of respect for you, we'll be on our way today. But hey... referee. Be careful from now on! You dumb-ass. You don't get to fuck us twice. - I'm going! - Playing dirty. - I'm going! - Serves you all right! Idiots! Idiots! Sign/lantern: "Kiryuin" Bro... Bro... bro! Are you sure suenaga did this? There's no mistake. Last night, tachiyama's crew ganged up and killed him. I saw it happen. I saw with my own eyes. Boss. My bro raised him... raised him from a pup, took care of him day and night. Please avenge him. I beg you! Boss! If you help me get my revenge... I will dedicate myself to your service, for the rest of my life. I implore you. I implore you. I implore you. So sorry. I've asked around, but nobody knows where suenaga is. He ran? I've heard it said he was a coward. If that's the case, it's almost cute. But probably, he's just hooked up with a new woman. People don't know it, but he's a sucker when it comes to women. Boss. What is it that you want with him? You can tell me, I'll listen in suenaga's stead. He hired someone who gutted kanematsu's sea god, using this gaff. I gave him my word that I'd exact revenge. So until suenaga shows up, I'm not budging. Are you saying, boss, that you've come all this way to avenge a dog? And how about you? When tosa storm was defeated... You got hysterical, as if he was your lover. I think you've made some kind of mistake, but... I'll discuss this with suenaga, and pay you a visit later. So for today, if you don't mind... Are you telling me, onimasa... To go home empty-handed? What would you have me do? You're here representing suenaga, so you must be prepared for the consequences. I understand... boss onimasa. I'll work off the debt. So that's what you've been using to drain suenaga's manhood. And the dragon on your back, boss... They say you're finished if it looks at you. And that no woman can resist it. Boss onimasa. Do you promise to let bygones be bygones after this? Madam. I must say, I have truly enjoyed the view. I'll be leaving now. As for suenaga, the day will come when he faces my justice. Tell him that. Don't underestimate me. A woman's seductive wiles cannot make me bend my principles. Bastard! Hey. All of you... We're leaving. Madam! We got trouble! They took otsuru-chan! Madam! Madam! We got trouble! They took otsuru-chan! Listen up. That punk suenaga probably won't retaliate. So consider this a festival for real men. It's been a while since we've had one. Give 'em hell! Alright! Let's raise hell. Yes! We're all ready. Yes. Don't lose your cool. It doesn't matter if the enemy numbers 1 or 10,000. Watch your step, look into the enemy's eyes, and thrust at them all at once. Don't retreat. Not even a step! Kuma! Don't be afraid. Yes sir. Lantern: "Kiryuin" They're not coming. They're not coming. Suenaga took a fishing boat to urado, with a geisha from akaoka. How annoying. I always knew the guy did things half-assed... But he's just a pathetic bump on a log. What a pain in the ass. Kanematsu. I need a bellyful of sea-breeze. I'm feeling antsy. - The merciless wind... merciless wind... - Alright, let's do it. Hey, kanematsu. Usa is beyond that mountain there. That's where I was born. When I was a kid, the adults and I would grab the Sandy bonito that washed up on shore. I'd put them on my shoulder, cross that mountain, and take them over to kochi. But I myself never got to eat Sandy bonito. Not even once. I told myself that one day, I'd be able to eat the Sandy bonito to my heart's content. That was my dream when I was a kid. You over there... are you perhaps onimasa-San? I'm onimasa of kutanda. But who are you? You shouldn't underestimate us here in akaoka. Not all of us here are gutless. I belong to suenaga heizo's family. My name is mikazuki jiro. I just got in from naniwa. How dare you disgrace my brother. Boss! Run! Please run! Indeed, when I see that you are so healthy and happy, sir suda, I, onimasa, sincerely rejoice. I hear things have been prosperous for you. Good to hear it. I appreciate it. I heard you had an altercation with suenaga. Well... it is a shameful matter. Alright, alright, that'll do. Masagoro... you, come over here. Yes. I heard you kidnapped a girl called tsuru. One of my men was wounded by a rabid dog named mikazuki jiro. He's teetering on the brink of life or death, even as we speak. I've heard that this jiro got arrested, and in the process got badly wounded. I'd say that your side came away slightly ahead. Well, sir... thanks... Please, I can't let this slide. If I were to give up on this, I, onimasa, would lose face. Masagoro... both you and suenaga are my prized proteges. Let's call this one a draw, and mend some fences. Sir. Is Botan well? Yes. She takes good care of me. When Botan fell for you, I gave her to you without complaint. Do you know why? It was because of what you said: "All a man needs is to dress sharply, eat well..." "And have a good woman to make love to. If I can have all that, I'm willing to die." I was impressed by your gusto. That's why. However, you shouldn't get a swelled head. A yakuza is a yakuza. Don't think you can rise above your station. I, for one, will not allow it. Understood? Sir. With all due respect, I don't think of myself as a yakuza. Well now... so you deem yourself a chivalrous man? I had no idea. Sir. Come on, don't get worked up. Just relax and hang out with me tonight. I'm much obliged. It is in this strong tone that we see... Pervasively, the simple joys of the Japanese ancients. Those of us who were born in the taisho period... By reciting this prose, now experience a renewed environment. Now... listen carefully. "In the effulgence of sunlight in spring..." Doors: "Ki" on both sides, the emblem for "kiryuin." Mother? I just got home. Mother? Mother? What now? You're a nuisance. I have run out of pencils. May I have some money? Ask your father. He keeps all the money in this house. The boss has returned. Welcome home. Welcome home. Welcome home. Welcome home, father. Call Botan and emiwaka for tonight. - Welcome home. - Yeah. How's kanematsu? Last I heard, he was in bad shape; We'll get more news soon. Do everything you can for him. Understood. Miss Botan. Miss emiwaka. Father has asked for you, for tonight. Come here a sec. Ma-chan, you work so hard. Close your eyes. Put out your hand. Buy yourself a picture-book or something. Thank you, miss. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. She's such a well-behaved, good girl. Was it my turn? Yeah it was. There. Madam... with your permission, we shall go up. Go on up. You think she's into that? Wear that. Otsuru-San. How come you don't go to the boss's bed? You've screwed him at least once, haven't you? They're laughing at you; Calling you "furniture" and "ornament." Doesn't that bother you? How can you call yourself a woman? Aren't you bitter at all? Don't fuck with me! I'm onimasa's wife. You mistresses are just furniture. I can buy you, or throw you away; I'm free to do as I please. Well? Do you understand? Auh! Aaaa! Mother, what's the matter? Mother? Mother, what's the matter? - Aaaa! - Mother? Idiot! Eyaa! Somebody help! Somebody! Hurry! What happened? She's having another attack. Come on, lend me a hand here. Aaaa! Hiroshi! Hurry! Over here! Hey! Here! Here! This way! - Aaahh! - Over here! Hang in there! = it hurts! Over here. Over here. It hurts! It hurts! You're drinking too much cold sake; You have to learn moderation. The loveliest of maidens... On the rock, just standing there. With a golden comb... She arranges her hair. Boss... you have been good to me. But I must ask to be allowed to leave. I know you're the boss, but there is only so much I can endure. I won't share our bed with this hick. I absolutely refuse. Tsuru... what are you doing here, anyway? I said, what are you doing here? I was told to come here. By whom? Ma-chan told me to come here. Matsue. I said to tell Botan to come here. Why did you talk to tsuru? I did not tell miss tsuru to come here. But tsuru says that you told her to come here. I did not tell her. I was told to come here. - That's a lie. - I was told. - That's a lie! - You told me I was to come here. - You liar! - You told me to come here! - You liar! - You did! Silence! Alright, then. I'll be the one to decide. Matsue... come and sit here. Now face tsuru. One of you is lying. Now strike the one who is lying. Strike with all your might. I'll take you on! Stay out of it! I'll take you on! Oh yeah? Damn youl! You... Country monkey! Bitch! Who's the bitch? Bitch! Damn youl! How dare youl! What's going on? Get out of here. Get out. You bitch! Bitch! - Please stop! Please stop! - Bitch! Please stop! Father! I was the one who lied! Please make them stop! I was the one who lied! Father! Bitch! Please forgive them! Father! Matsue... You are lying. You're lying, aren't you? Ma-chan would never lie! I know that for a fact! The liar's that mountain chimp! If you can't see that, boss... You're a blind man! What? You're calling me a blind man? You stupid bitch! Father, please forgive her! Please forgive her! Please forgive her, father! Father! Father! Please forgive her, father! Father, forgive her! Ma-chan... You're... How about that. Ma-chan, there's nothing to be afraid of. I'll help you through it. Well, what do you know? You've finally become a woman. How about that. Oh, madam. Ma-chan got her first period. Ma-chan, open the door. I'll help you out. Ma-chan. Ma-chan. Open the door. Ma-chan. I will teach her. I am matsue's mother. Really? Well, excuse me. When have you done anything motherly? Matsue, open up, it's mother. - Matsue's mother. Yeah right. - Matsue, it's your mother. Matsue. Hurry up and open up, matsue. Matsue. You're a woman after all... You wanted me to sleep with you, even if you had to lie. Feel it twitching here, in a weird way. Maybe... I'm with child. What? A child, you say? I don't hear anything. Also, boss... My "monthly visitor" is ten days late. My belly is so queasy. I can hardly eat. You... when you first came here, you were a virgin, weren't you? And you're not the type that has a man on the side... No kidding... No kidding... That's right... This might be for real. If this is for real, this is a big deal! I'm going to have a child. My child will be born. I'm a father. Right? I'm a father! I'm a father. At the harimaya bridge in kochi of tosa... I saw the temple priest buy a hairpin. Yosakoi, yosakoi... Hanako sure is an oddball. She shows no interest in toys at all, no matter what I buy for her. She's only happy with cosmetics. Lately she can tell the different brands; She can tell that this one is club... This one is papilio, and this one is shiseido. She's going to be quite the lady. So much to look forward to. Father, did you send for me? Matsue. Tsuru tells me that all you've been doing lately is study... And you're not babysitting hanako at all. Actually, I'd rather that you didn't handle the baby. If you didn't pay attention, and Hana-chan got hurt, that would be unforgivable. Boss... matsue's been saying she wants to go to girls' school. Girls' school? Father... I took the entrance examination for the prefecture first high school for girls. I passed the exam. What did you say? Father, please. Let me go to the girls' high-school. Please let me go. I forbid it! Girls going to high-school is out of the question! Please let me go. Please let me go, father. Please let me go! You can't! I say you can't, and I absolutely mean it! Please let me go. Please me go, father! Please. Please, I beg you. Father, please let me go! Please let me go! - Father, pl... - You can't! "Baby bird... egg... dragonfly..." "Baby bird... egg... dragonfly..." Chalkboard: " Baby bird, egg, dragonfly, black cat, white dog..." Chalkboard: " Baby bird, egg, dragonfly, black cat, white dog..." "Monkey and crab." Chalkboard: " Baby bird, egg, dragonfly, black cat, white dog..." Chalkboard: " Baby bird, egg, dragonfly, black cat, white dog..." "Monkey and crab." "Monkey and crab." "Persimmon seed." "Rice balls." Out of the way! Asshole! Hey you. My goodness, it's been forever. Well, it's been a long time. - Have a seat. - Yeah. You seem well. I am, thank you. The tosa railroad strike has been going on for five days now. The people have no way to get about; They are much inconvenienced. Inasmuch as sir suda is the primary shareholder of the tosa railroad... He has expressed his concern over the situation... And would like for you, boss, to take action. What's he asking me to do? Several of the ringleaders are labor-movement activists. With them out of the picture, the strike will fall apart. That's easy... please relay to sir suda that I, onimasa, said leave it to me. But there's one condition. We don't want any publicity. You must ensure that no one gets hurt. I am onimasa of kutanda. I am here on behalf of sir suda uichi... The primary shareholder. I need to speak with your leaders. Please let me through. Please let me through. I said get out of my way. I am unarmed. Onimasa is all alone. Are you scared, idiots? Are you the leader? I am kondo, the head of the labor committee. This is tanabe-San, a teacher at kochi commerce. He has been supporting us, and fighting with us. So he's the strategist. Well, if you put it that way, yes. Let's get down to business. You say the primary stockholder's got something to tell us. What is it? Onimasa-San. What is it that you have to say? Did you come here to screw with us?! What are you doing here? I'm here to make the trains go again. Don't mess with us! Shithead! What do you plan on doing to us? Promise you'll stop the strike. If you refuse, then as sure as my name is onimasa, there will be trouble. Are you a chivalrous man, onimasa-San? I am. No, you are not. What did you say? Chivalrous men help the weak and fight the strong. You cannot call yourself chivalrous. You are the ones that are bullies! Children are crying from hunger... Whole families are committing suicide. What does it matter that people can't ride the train? Don't make stuff up! You yourself must know the pain of poverty. I'm a self-made man. I've never had anyone's sympathy or help. Are you sure about that? You're that so-called "sir" suda's pet dog, aren't you? Why else would you be here? Pet dog, you say? Say it again! Sure. I'll say it as many times as you want. You are a pet dog. A pet dog! Say it again. You're a pet dog. You're a pet dog. Damn you... Bastard... You're a pet dog. You're a pet dog. You're a pet... Pet dog. Pet... Pet dog. You... what was your name again? Tanabe... Tanabe kyosuke. Tanabe... Good good good. Straighten it, straighten it more. Left, left, left. Left, left. Young miss! Young miss! Is it here? Here? Boss... suddenly I hear you're talking about the evils of society... what's going on? I have thought the matter through, and reached a conclusion. Because of the world war, the economic depression is becoming deeper. Now is the time to help the weak and the poor. That is the path of chivalry. - Call matsue here. - Yes. At a time like this... Can we go on leeching off the poor? Would that be right? But kanematsu's prostitution racket is what keeps us going. Things are depressed all around. From what I've heard lately... Stop babbling. Anyway, as of today, no more buying and selling women. Hey, matsue. There you are. I want you to write out the characters for that sign. Here's the words. What's hanako doing? She's practicing riding the bicycle. "Tosa laborers' union reserve coordinators" boss. What are you going to do with the sign? I'm going to display it outside. Where there are capitalists, there are laborers. And where there are laborers, there is a union. Boss, what about the promise you made to sir suda? If I, onimasa, have a frank talk with him, he will understand. We must support each other in this world. We must co-exist, and communicate with each other. And that's the path... Of chivalry. What? Boss. Sir suda's messenger brought this. Read it. "It is with great regret that we inform you that..." "Your deeds conflict with the traditions of the suda family..." "And therefore, henceforth you are not welcome to visit us." Boss... what are we going to do? Boss. I know. Uta... time to change my clothes. What are you going to do? None of you must follow me. Don't do it, no matter what. What the... Who gave you permission to come here? Sir... sir suda. I do not know what has angered you. If it's regarding the tosa railroad strike, I, onimasa... This very night, will definitely have a discussion with them, and... A "discussion"? I don't send a man like you to have a "discussion." Onimasa-San. The other night, you and the ring-leaders drank until dawn. You went around saying, "crush the cruel capitalists!" You were hollering at the top of your voice; Everyone heard it. That... That was a ploy to throw off the enemy. Sir. I will assuredly settle the matter. They... they have their own reasons. It's all over now. Even as we speak, the police are rounding them up. The police? Masagoro. Look at this yokozuna dog. Suenaga brought him here, but when I try to feed him... He won't even look at the food. Even a dog, an animal, is loyal to the one who raised him. Shame on you! Sir! Please wait. Your words have shook me to the core. Starting today, I, onimasa, will no longer be your pet dog. Regarding the tosa railroad... I only followed the principles of chivalry. May the gods be my witness, I have done nothing to be ashamed of. I haven't! Excuse me. Bastard! There... Let's see if you got any balls... The boss is back! He's come back! Welcome home. - Call matsue. - Yes. Uta! I've decided who will marry hanako. What are you saying? Hana-chan's only 16. What? Weren't you a geisha at 14? - Well, yeah, but... - Hanako! Hanako! I've found a groom for you. His name's tanabe. A man with a moral backbone. Boss? What kind of man is this tanabe? Hey matsue. You'll go and visit him at the jail tomorrow. Jail? This young man, tanabe kyosuke, has been imprisoned for hitting a cop. I will see to it that this man tanabe marries hanako... And becomes my successor as leader of our family. - Father. - Wha...? Hanako wants to go to see the moving pictures. Alright then, go ahead. Listen up! From now on, we of the kiryu family must persevere. All of you must earn an honest living from now on. To do that, you must use this. This. This tanabe, we need him in our family, no matter what. Matsue. He's a college graduate, only you can persuade him. Win him over for us. This is your responsibility. Understood?! So you are onimasa's daughter? I am matsue. I was sent by my father. I have brought you underwear and other sundries. My father is concerned that you might be uncomfortable. Thank you. It's thoughtful of him. But I'm surprised... That onimasa-San would have a daughter like you. It seems my father holds you in very high regard, tanabe-San. I know my father wanted to visit with you too, but... I think he has an aversion to this kind of place. Nobody likes a place like this. You too. Please, go home. I will visit you again. Is there anything that you might be needing? - Is that rilke's "die aufzechnungen?" - Yes. The German-language edition. Would you like to have it? Are you sure? Please. I have other books to read. Yes... this gift makes me the happiest. - How much is this one? - 2-sen. Cut me some slack! 1-sen! - I'm home. - Welcome home. - Welcome home. - Welcome home. - Roku-chan... - Yes? - What's going on? We've got a guest. - A guest? - Yes. Ma-chan... Hello, I'm home. Tanabe-San has dropped by for a visit. He's been released. I'm so glad. Young miss, you go on in too. I'll see him later, I can congratulate him anytime. Come on. Well, tanabe-San... Yes. As a token of my congratulations for your release... I would like to offer you a present. Is there anything that you'd like to have? Just name it. Anything you want. There's nothing at all that I can't do. There is something that I definitely want. What is it? Your matsue-San... I want matsue-San. As the school has dismissed me, I now intend to move to Osaka. I am planning on doing work that will be useful to society. After meeting her several times while I was in prison, I have concluded... That my life partner can only be matsue-San. Tanabe kyosuke! You thieving alley cat. I'll hack you to pieces! How have I offended you? Please explain. How long have you and matsue been an item? How offensive! I have merely asked for matsue-San's hand in marriage. She knows nothing about this. Shut up! You've been screwing my daughter behind my back, haven't you? - Wh... - You ungrateful dog bastard! Wh... what are you saying that matsue-San and I have done? What are you saying has happened between us?! If you want to have matsue, then I'm sure... That you've already slept with her. You did, didn't you? I know you did! I know for sure! Foolishness! I just got out of prison! All right, then. Takezo. Strip matsue, and bring her here. Matsue, get out of here. Sagara! Kuma! Hurry up and bring her here! Now wait just a minute! How could you do such a thing?! How could I? Matsue's mine, I can do whatever I want! She's mine! What is the matter with you?! It cannot be helped. It's all because I said what I said. I will prove matsue-San's purity with my own body! - What did you say? - Bring it on! Is this your idea of a present? A beheading? I have a mountain of tasks that lie ahead of me. I cannot go so far as to give you my life... But go ahead and cut off an arm or a leg! I see... I see... Well said... I won't take your arm. But if you've got the guts... Your finger. Cut off your finger. Your finger! Uta! Make the preparations. Father! Father, stop this! Please stop! Stop it! Mother, please make them stop! Please stop! Please stop! Please stop! Father! Please stop them, mother! Please stop them! This is no business for women. Ma-chan, it's just as madam says. Come here, ma-chan. Come over here. Tanabe-San's going to cut off his finger. Hurry up and make the preparations. Don't just stand there looking stupid. Bring a cutting-board and lots of bleach. And sterilizer and bandages. Y... yes. They cannot defeat me by this kind of thing. But listen... As soon as you possibly can... no... how, even... You must flee this heap of human trash. That man... was going to be my husband. Ma-chan, you stole him from me. Ma-chan, you stole him from me! Matsue. Your father is calling for you. He said he's waiting for you at yokiro. He said he wants to talk to you, face to face. You probably have a thing or two to tell him too. You might as well settle things, once and for all. Boss. The person you sent for is here. Father. Pour me one. Pour for me. I will take you! Stop! Stop it! Why do you resist? Why do you resist? If I leave you alone, you'll catch a bad infection! Think of this as an act of mercy! Matsue. Matsue. What do you think I am? And what do you think you are? Since the day you came to the house in kutanda... you... you've been mine! No! No! Be quiet! You're stubborn... Hold it. - I'm going to die. - Stop it. Stop it. I will die. I will die. Matsue. Die... You... Do you... Hate me that much? Well, sorry about that. Sorry. In the Autumn twilight... The maple leaves gleam brightly. Leaves of all colors, dark and light... Evergreen pines contrasting... Your voices are weak. More cheer, everyone. With the maples and Ivy. Hey, it's been a long time. How've you been? Good to see you. You're most kind. You haven't changed a bit. Come in, come in. Welcome. I'm yamane. So then... may I make the introductions? This is the boss of the yamane family... gondo tetsuo-San. I am gondo. Nice to meet you. Well... nice to meet you. This is my daughter, hanako. She's an unruly one, but please treat her well. Likewise for us. Tip the large chalice... When you are in tosa, you are among friends. We have red snapper... and good sake. Let us all feast together. I enjoy it all gratefully. Onimasa-San. From this moment forward, please treat me well. Don't mention it. You're on a roll now, yamane-San. As long as you and I are bound in brotherhood, it's like I have a million allies. Not to mention, you've introduced my daughter to such a fine man. L... am grateful to you. Propitious! Propitious, propitious indeed! Gondo-San and hanako-San are the ultimate couple. Because of this... the families of onimasa-San of shikoku and yamane-San of kansai... Are now interlocked in a solid relationship. This makes me the number-one best man in all of Japan. Thank you very much. Thanks. By the way, onimasa-San. I heard you have another daughter. That would be young miss matsue. She is an elementary school teacher in the town of ochi, about 8-li away from kochi. - A schoolteacher? - Yeah. I see. I've heard that she's quite a beauty. Yeah, yeah. Why did she get skipped over? Why is the younger daughter getting married first? Matsue is a daughter, but she's not related by blood. I see. I see. Hurry up. Sorry about the awkward scene. Hey, teken, teken, start the teken. - Do you like bows? - Welcome. Please buy one. Which one would you like? That one. - Yes, yes, one moment please. - Give us that one. - How much? - That will be ¥1. ¥1. Yes. Thank you very much. Alright. I'll put it on top. Looks good on you. It suits you. W... welcome back. - Welcome back. - Welcome back. - Young master gondo has safely departed. - Good to hear it. Hey... how's uta doing? The doctor's examining her, but it doesn't seem to be the usual problem. I see... Send for matsue. Other than matsue... There's no one who can care for uta. Send a telegram. Get matsue back here. Well hello there, doctor... I appreciate your help. Onimasa-San. Yeah. Your wife has a rather worrisome ailment. What do you mean by "worrisome?" She's got typhus. Ty... Typhus... you mean... The epidemic? That's right. Hanako! Hanako! Hanako! Tsuru! Tsuru! Tsuroko, where are you? Hey, tsuru... Take hanako and go to kanematsu's house at once! Boss, what's going on? T... typhus! There's an outbreak of typhus! There's no time to waste! If hanako gets sick, all is lost! Father. What is typhus? Onimasa-San. We've got to move your wife to a quarantine hospital as soon as possible. A quarantine hospital? What are you talking about? Uta's not going anywhere! Sagara, shut her in, right away. You can't do that. This is a deadly epidemic; The mortality rate is one out of three. The law says that all epidemic patients must go to the quarantine hospital. Law? The law can eat shit! She's my precious wife, we've been companions for many years. I'll never let her die in some filthy hospital. Uta will never leave my side. Doctor... If you kill uta, you'll answer to me. Don't you forget it. - I have brought miss matsue. - Bring her in. Welcome back. Ma-chan. How have you been? Hi, uncle. Has everyone been well? - Yes, thanks. - Yes. Is mother alright? She's sleeping upstairs. She's alright for now. They're disinfecting the room right now. Madam... I know it's uncomfortable, but it's only for a short while. Mother... how are you? Are you comfortable? Mother... Machan, let's go. Let's go. Wait. Do I have to die in a place like this? Uncle. I'll stay here with mother. But ma-chan... Bring my meals and leave them on the stairs. What if you catch it? = I'll be fine. But what about teaching? I'll write the school a letter. - Ma-chan. - Uncle. I'll be alright. Young miss? I'll leave your things here. Mother. I'm tired. I'm languid. Rub... rub my legs for me. Boss. It'll be all over if ma-chan gets sick too. Please, boss, tell her to return to the school. Matsue's staying here no matter what. But, boss, how could you say that? Uta is matsue's mother... It's a child's duty to look after their parents. Mother. You have to eat your meal. Y... you can eat it. Have all you want. Later... I want you to comb my hair. I've fallen in love. Mother. You have to take it easy. You have... to take it easy. Matsue. Please forgive me. All this time... I have been mean to you. But I... didn't want you... To have to live... A life like mine. Have no regrets. No regrets... I have no regrets... Mother... what's the matter? What's the matter? What's the matter? You can't die. You can't die. You can't. You can't die. Please don't die. Please don't die. You can't. You can't. You can't... Would you like one? Would you? 1937, winter - Osaka 1937, winter - Osaka it's a magazine for workers. "The call of the land." Care for a copy? It's a magazine for workers. "The call of the land." care for a copy? The following year, after I recovered, I went to tanabe-San in Osaka. The day I left the house, my father secluded himself in his room... And refused to say a single word. - Matsue. - A copy is 30... Shall we get going? I'm going to keep at it. I've only sold five or six copies. But, you shouldn't overexert yourself. It might affect the baby in your womb. Let's go somewhere and get something warm to eat. Are you the one responsible for the publication of this magazine? That's right. You're coming with us. Come on, you come too. We have some questions regarding the contents of the magazine. What do you find objectionable? We suspect you are guilty of disturbing the peace. - I have done no such thing. Leave us alone. - Shut up! You're coming with us! Let me go! Bastard! Stop it! Stop it! Please stop it! Please stop it! Stop! Please stop it! Kyosuke-San! Let's go with the police and talk. They'll understand. Alright. Take them. They think we're communists, and trying to stir up the workers. How ridiculous. They said the same things to me. They said I was a red-influenced teacher, and the daughter of a yakuza family. So they think I'm worse than you. If my father in kutanda heard that, he'd be mad. At least they let you go without beating you. Sure. Because we haven't done anything wrong. That's right. We haven't done anything wrong. But we haven't been of much use to anybody either. That's not true. Many people who've read our work have said encouraging things about it. They're just humoring us. Bankruptcies, layoffs, not paying the workers... And what if a war starts? Everything in Japan will come to an end. Used to be suspicious... Of you and onimasa-San. In what way? When I went there to ask for your hand in marriage, he behaved strangely. I thought to myself, that's fine... Even if I thought... onimasa-San was your first man. How could you? How could you? Is that what you've been thinking about me this whole time? No, I trust you now. You know I... That's not true. In your heart... You still wonder... No. Matsue. I don't hate onimasa-San. I don't even doubt him. He's not a fake. He's down-to-earth and genuine. That's why he's strong. That's why he's strong. But me... in comparison... But me... Boss. There's a telegram from the boss of the yamane family. Read it to me. Yes. "G-0-n-d-o0. D-i-e-d." "G-0-n-d-o0. D-i-e-d." "De-tai-is. In. Le-tt-er. Y-a-ma-ne." Hanako. Wake up, now. Wake up, now. What's going on? Father? Gondo-San... died, in asakusa, in Tokyo. Gondo-San died. It says gondo-San died. It's a lie! That's what it is. It's no lie. Father, you're lying. You're just trying to shock me, it's just a whopper. - It's no whopper. - Well it isn't true. I know. I'll go see gondo-San. I'm off to Kobe. He's not in Kobe! Hanako! I'm going to Kobe. I'm going to go see gondo-San. Hanako... Is going to go see gondo-San. Hanako. I hate you, father! I hate you! I hate you, hate you, hate you! I hate you, father! I hate you, hate you, hate you! I hate you! I hate you! Hate youl! Hate you! Are you alright? You're not uncomfortable? It's only another hour or so to tokushima. You know, matsue... Let's just head to kochi, like we said. We'll go to kochi, you can have the baby there, and then we'll go to tokushima. No matter how obstinate my father is... When he sees the face of his grandchild, he'll approve of us. I disagree. No matter what... we must sincerely talk to him. For the sake of the child in my womb... I want your father to acknowledge that I am your wife. Dear... I'd like some water. Matsue! Matsue! Are you alright? The baby... Somebody, a doctor! Get a doctor! Matsue. Please... the baby... Matsue. Help. Matsue. We need it. We need it no matter what. ¥100 per man. I don't care if it's robbery or thievery. Go and get it from somewhere. If you can't do as much, how could you call yourself... One of onimasa's men? How could you say you're in our family? I found out the whereabouts of otsuru-San. She eventually got dumped by tsujihara... Now she's selling herself, somewhere in mikuni, in echizen. That lowlife tsujihara's wronged a lot of people... now he's vanished. Should we bring her back? I think what happened to gondo-San shocked her... she must've gotten confused. Forget it. Prostitution suits her. Boss... miss matsue has returned to kochi. What should we do? I know she's back! I, no matter what, will live out my life as your wife. We've lost our baby, but if I were to lose my resolve in life too... Then what have I been living for, all this time? Uncle... everyone... I'm so happy to see you well. Ma-chan, you look well too. Look how pretty you've become! Your presence here is like a flower blossoming in the kiryu family. The boss is glad too. Young miss, you should go on upstairs. - Yeah. - We hope you like it. I know your tastes the best. We made it like he told us, but if you don't like it, we'll change it. That would be best. Truly... everyone... thank you. I grew up in this room. This room was Botan-San and emiwaka-San's room; I've told you a lot about them. Everything here looks completely ready for you to move in. Onimasa-San... must've been looking forward to your return. If you don't mind... the boss is calling for you, in a loud voice. Yes. Tonight, it should just be you and your father, without me. I'll stay out of it. Come on. Go ahead. Throw, twist, bend backward... Hook, and swipe legs. - Have some. - Thank you. Just you and I together like this... It's certainly been such a long time. It seems that you and tanabe-San are having quite a tough time together. No, we're not having a tough time. The two of you getting along so well... it makes me happy. If a husband and wife believe in each other, that's a good thing. Because if that's not the case, sooner or later, there'll be trouble. Yeah. Take tsuru, for example. Since the day she came to this house... She might've been hating me, in the depths of her heart. But hanako is innocent. I want to make her happy. And do whatever I can for her. I was thinking that maybe she might marry kanematsu... And they could run a legit restaurant or something. The kiryu family will end with me, just the one generation. I wish you could stay with me, and be by my side, until the day I die. Father. Father. What? Kyosuke is fond of you. Really? I see. I see. Just hearing that is wonderful. Hey. Fireworks. It's fireworks. It's fireworks. Look at them go up. They explode in a flash. And quickly fade. Fireworks are indeed like a man's life lived with fortitude. There they go. S... somebody! Tell boss onimasa... Suenaga's henchmen did it. Kanematsu took some guys to get her back. - Matsue. - Yes? L... was not right for you... Dear... dear... Dear... Get out. Please get out. Look... matsue. All of you... All of you killed him. Get out of here! Get out of here! My dear... My dear... Why did you die so soon? We didn't get to talk. You haven't heard what I had to say. I had important things to tell you. Things I wanted you to hear. I had things to say. My dear... Give us Hana-chan back! I'll haunt you! Boss! Forgive us! Give me a good death blow. You got it. Did any of you bastards kill onimasa yet? We haven't killed him yet; We don't know where he is. What did you say? Asshole, hurry up and find him! What are you doing? Go search upstream. He could be with another group. If you want the ashes of my son, show me how Sincere you really are. Sell your body to a whorehouse or something, and pay for the sin of getting my son killed. Get out of here, now! Hey! What do you think you're doing? You thieving alley cat! Let me tell you. These are the remains of the heir to the house of tanabe. I'd rather feed them to dogs and cats than give them to yakuza and criminals. Well? Hurry up and get out of here! Y... you! Hey, what are you doing? Hey! Come and grab her! Grab her and take her to the police! You guys want something? I am the daughter... of the chivalrous man of kutanda in kochi. The daughter of kiryuin masagoro. I am the daughter of onimasa. You better not... You better not fuck with me! How'd it go in tokushima? Did you get what you wanted? Good. Ma-chan. Have a look at this. Boss had it sculpted. He said it was an offering on behalf of our family. Kiryuin: Masagoro, uta, hanako, matsue. Matsue... I'm not going there to fight. I'm going there to die with hanako. She's a stupid girl, but... She's still my daughter. I'm responsible for everything that happened. All I can do for hanako now... Is to die together with her. Matsue... I have caused you nothing but suffering. I've got nothing to leave to you. Forgive me. Father... I... met you... I came to this house... And I truly... Truly... am glad. Matsue... Let me have a good look at you. I have to get going. Let me look at your face. Come now. Don't cry. Don't cry. Matsue... You've grown to be a fine woman. I was right about you. So I... have the greatest daughter in all of Japan. You... and only you... Are what I'm proud of. You... You... I'm so proud of you. Father. Onimasa. I'm tired of waiting for you. I don't have any more hidden dynamite. Give me an honest duel, just you and me. Jiro... I have already won. A human life is 20,000 days. We're all going to die eventually. I got nothing holding me back. Good to hear it. You'll be going to hell. Hanako... Hanako, where are you? Hanako! The dogs... Come here. Sagara... Get up. Boss. Sagara... Bastards. Boss. Don't come closer. Don't come closer. Hanako... Come here. Come home with dad. Come home with dad. Come here. That night, my father turned himself in. And within two years, he died in the prison at abashiri. After that, I had no idea where hanako was... Though I looked for her everywhere. But one day, after a little time had passed, out of the blue... A letter arrived at the deserted house in kutanda. It said only one thing... In clumsy handwriting: "Father..." "Please help me." "Father... please... help." That's... all it said. Letter: "Father, please..." The end
