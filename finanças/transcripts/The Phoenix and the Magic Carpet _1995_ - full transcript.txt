Grownup people find it very difficult to believe really wonderful things unless they have what they call proof but children will believe almost anything Grownups know this, that's why they tell us that the earth is round like an orange when we can see that it's flat and lumpy and why they say that the earth goes around the sun when it's obvious that the sun gets up in the morning and goes to bed at night and the earth stays still as a mouse. But I guess you believe all that about the earth and the sun so you'll find it easy to believe what happened to Robert, Chris and me last Winter in England. Boo! Aghhh! [music ] Grandpa had just died and we were helping Mom sort out all the things he'd left behind. [music ] Gotya! Hey! Watch it Chris! Whoa! [fall] Ouch! Guys! Sorry Mom. You know, with helpers like you two Sorry Mom. Ow. Hmm. [running] Hey, I guess watching the bonfire will be like watching TV. Grandpa probably died of boredom. You know, I know it's hard for you all to understand but Grandpa thought watching TV was a waste of time. You mean he never watched TV?! Well, in all fairness, I think he did rent one once but only to watch a special on Tutankhamun. Hey, why don't we rent one while we're here? Hey, because I don't want you to spend your vacation watching TV! [sigh] Besides, this house is full of interesting things. Yeah, sure! Oh, Grandpa; he spent his whole life collecting treasures from the four corners of the earth. How can it have corners if it's round? Very funny. Ow, Chris! Leave Mom alone. (laugh) He went to Egypt, India, Arabia he always brought back some treasure or at least what an anthropologist thought was a treasure. The rest of us might describe it more as Junk? Curios. That's junk of great sentimental value. Anyway, it's almost time for lunch. Let's go see what Helga's made for us. Oh, no. Not the dreaded Helga! Attila the Hun in a skirt! Guys! Look, I know you didn't want to spend your vacation here but let's not take it out on poor Helga, shall we? Come here, you. You don't know how lucky we are to have her round here helping out. Anyway, your dad will be here in a couple of days and he'll show you all the things you can do around here. Mom! Can we light the fire now? Yes, after lunch, and only if Helga's there to supervise you. I have a meeting at 3 with the lawyer so I'll expect you [drum] ALL TO BEHAVE! [footsteps] Wow! Hey Rob! What? Come here, I found something. Come on, hurry. Look. Jewels! "Jewels? ""J.E. WILSON"" - duffus," that's Grandpa's name: JONATHAN EDWARD WILSON Hmm. Kids! Wow! Hey, Rob! Now what? Look what I found! Must be something precious all wrapped up like this. Yeah, more jewels I guess. Wow! Look at this! Looks like an egg but feels like a rock. Hey, may be it's a dinosaur egg! Chris, get real. Come on you guys. Your turn to set the table. What's that? Chris thinks it's a dinosaur egg. I think we should tell mom. You would! I think we should all swear never, ever to tell anybody about the egg. It's our secret - deal? Deal. Ow, all right, deal. But what are we going to do with it? Well, maybe if I keep it warm it'll hatch. Gross. Who knows what can be in there! Could be a great big hairy spider with poisonous fangs! [noise] I thought you said it was a dinosaur egg? I could be wrong. [music and noise of burning bonfire] That's the last of the junk. You did a pretty good job there. Good, now we can all go inside. Already? Can we stay out a little while and watch the fire? Chris! [German] Keep away from te fire. Just a little longer? O.K. Five more minutes, but that is all. Yes! Chris! Do not move until I come back! Jawohl! Your vord is my command. Australia will be just far enough! [whisper] O.K. Let me see Anything hatching yet? Sure, it's only been a couple of hours Oh! [fall] Quick, let's get it out! Here, try this. [music sting] Wow! What is it? This way! [music and footsteps] Come on. Pray tell me who is responsible for this deed? It talks. Who placed the precious egg in the fire? He did. Um, but he blindsided me. I am your grateful debtor. Do you not know who I am? What do they teach you in school these days? Science, technology, environment stuff. You have the pleasure and privilage of addressing the one and only - Phoenix! That's in Arizona, right? They teach us geography too. He said he is the Phoenix, duffus, not he is from Phoenix. Oh. I am pleased to hear that they have named a city after me. You do know who I am, don't you? Oh yes, the Phoenix is that sunbird that's supposed to live for hundreds of years. Supposed to? What do you mean supposed to? Well, Miss Lewis said you never really existed. You are like a mythical creature like dragons and Unicorns Indeed! My dear young friend, do you prefer to take this Miss Lewis's word or to believe your own eyes? Well, it's not only Miss Lewis, there is a part in the encyclopeadia on you too. It doesn't look a bit like you. Hey children! I said only five more minutes, remember? We'd better go in or Helga will be on the warpath again. We can't let anyone see the Phoenix, especially not Helga. She'll send him to the birdpound or something. Why don't you put him under your jacket. It's too big, it'll never fit. Hemmm! May be he can fly in through the window? If you'll forgive the intrusion, "I am not accustomed to being referred to as ""it""" and I would just like to point out that no one has had the courtesy to ask me whether I wish to enter your abode. I shall, therefore, bid you farewell. Don't go! Sorry. It's not like we are used to having a conversation with a bird. Except Grandpas's parrot "but what he ever said was ""who's a pretty b""" Yes, we really are sorry Sir, but would you care to step inside Grandpa's study and look at your very own picture in the the encyclopeadia? I am happy to accept your invitation to inspect this portrait of myself. Perhaps you'd like to make a grand entrance through that window over there? [Music; footsteps on the stairs, door banging] Now kindly allow me to look at this portrait which purports to be of myself. There. You are quite correct. Not a flattering likeness. But I am pleased to see that my fame has lived for 2,000 years. Pray read what it says about me. Phoenix. In ornothology a fabulous bird of antiquity... Antiquity, indeed. And you are fabulous! Quite so. Connected with the worship of the Sun-God Not much sun in England, Phoenix. Sure picked the wrong place. Only one Phoenix existed and was very long lived, at least five hundred years. Five hundred years! Even Grandpa wasn't that old. Ah, continue if you please. As its end approached, it fashioned a nest of aromatic flowers and spices set it on fire, thus burnt itself. From the pyre sprang a new Phoenix ...identical to its father, with golden feathers a purple body and white tail. My body was never purple. And as for my tail - well I ask you, is it white? It's pure gold! And what about my egg? Does it not say anything about my egg? No. Nothing. Now Phoenix, we are dying to know how your egg got here? Yeah, like, where did it come from? Ah, that is my life's secret. I couldn't tell anyone who wasn't really sympathetic. But I might tell you. You put me on the fire. Well, that was more of an accident really. Your honesty removes my last scruple. I shall tell you my story. Watch the crystal ball and imagine that it is a window on the past. Hmmm. I had resided for many thousands of years in the wilderness, which is a large, empty place. One morning I heard a strange noise above my head I saw two young people on a Magic Carpet. They were a Prince and a Princess. An Enchanter had given them a Magic Carpet and they asked it to take them away from everyone so they could be alone, together. As they meant to stay in the wilderness they had no further use for the carpet, where as I, on the contrary, had an immediate and rather pressing use for it. [thunder] I entreated the Prince to wrap my egg in the carpet. I then asked the carpet to take the egg somewhere where it could not be hatched for two thousand years. Then - I burnt myself up... [Thunder] [Roar] and not a moment too soon! And that was the last I knew until I woke on yonder altar. What happened to the Prince and Princess? And what about the Magic Carpet? Aha-hmm. I should say that this is the very carpet Yes, indeed! A carpet of antiquity! Oh, it should not be lying on the floor. But that's what carpets are for. Not a Magic Carpet. Why, that carpet has been the property of Caliphs, Kings, Sultans! It never lay on the floor before. Are you telling me, this ratty old carpet is a Magic Carpet? Yes, I remember the pattern perfectly. Think the magic's worn out after all these years? My dear young fellow, the carpet may wear out but magic lasts forever. So we could ask it to take us somewhere? Anywhere. Provided you can speak to it. Are you fluent in old Persian? Anthea has enough problems with pig-latin. Well, I suppose I could act as interpreter. That'd be too cool! Would you? And where, pray, would you like me to instruct the carpet to transport you? How about the Valley of the Kings? We could see the pyramids, Tutankhamun's tomb Boooring! How about catching some rays on a tropical island? Oh, yeah. Warm water, soft sand and golden sunshine! Just like the commercials. Mom says these places are never like they seem on TV They are always full of half-built hotels, hot-dog stands and people trying to sell you rugs. What you got against hot-dog stands? If I may offer a word of advice, just ask for a sunny beach with no hotels, no hot-dog stands and no people selling rugs. I got it! Treasure Island! With hot-dogs stands. C'mon Chris. Just one? O.K. Yeah! [crash-bang] What are you children doing in there?! Better block the door! Wait, wait, you guys. How are we supposed to get this carpet through that window? I know. If we all sit in a row and pull the sides of the carpet Oh, children of the twentieth century, so concerned with the technicalities of life, so ignorant of its magic. There are more things in heaven and earth, my friends, than are dreamt of in your technology he-mem to coin a phrase. Just seat yourselves on the Magic Carpet, watch and wander! [Music][German] What is going on? C'mon, hurry up. Phoenix, come on! Mora-baya-jazire bar-sirebeba C'mon Phoenix! Open the door! Oh! Owhh.. Whoa.. How did we get out? May be if we hadn't closed our eyes we would've seen what happened. Vas is das? I must be dreaming. Yes, it is just a dream. Madam, you are mistaken. A talking parrot. I wonder what it means. It's not a dream, Helga. Yea, yea. That is what they always say in dreams. But it's not a dream, you silly weird ditso. This is for real. You will not talk to me like this even in a dream! Calm yourself, good woman. Cease your prattle. Right on Phoenix! No-one talks to Helga Rotweinger like this, especially not a parrot. Helga! Wow. This beats any rollercoaster we've ever been on! All right Phoenix, way to go! [laughter] That was so cool. Thanks Phoenix. You are welcome. [music] Ahhh! Ow Sure is sunny. Perfect. Great! [Music] Yeah! {Vocals: Wondrous days where dreams came true and there's no one there to harm you} It is still a dream. {...and never thought those day would end} [Instrumental] Anthea, Rob, come quick! [Instrumental] What's the point of a hot-dog stand with no hot-dogs, no drinks, no nothing! You should've asked for some Look, you didn't even want a hot-dog stand on your beach! I didn't know we'd get thirsty so soon. [Music] What we're gonna do is down some coconut milk! Sure, little buddy, but where's the coconuts? We've got to find something, I am dying of thirst. Hey, may be there's a stream nearby? Great idea. Come on. Wait! What about Helga will be fine. I was talking about the carpet. Right. Phoenix. [yawn] Will you guard the carpet for us? I give you my word I will not move an inch. [yawn] All right, you thumb-sucking, lily-livered dirtbags, prepare to become men! Sometimes I think Mom's right. He does watch too much television. Of course, there still are dinousaurs lurking in the unexplored parts of the world. [Birds screeching] [Ominous music] [Birds screaching] You were just kidding about the dinosaurs, right? Relax. Most of them are plant eaters. Most of them. Thanks Chris. Now when they sneak up on us they'll grab you first. Get real, Chris. Don't you think we'd hear a ten ton animal trying to sneak up on us? [breaking branches] [music sting - Danger!] Something's in there. Better head back. Which way to the beach? That way. Nono I don't know. Come on. [Music; running] Aghhh! Help! Phoenix! Help me Phoenix! Aghhh! Phoenix! Follow me. This way. [Music; escape] Quick on the carpet! Get us out of here Phoenix! It's an emergency! Mara forab Mehanibebar! [Music] That was close. That was great! [phone ringing] Shhhh. The phone! Helga! Oh my God, we've lost Helga! [phone ringing] Alo. Ha, very good Anthea. [Mouthing: It's Mom.] Now let me talk to Helga. She went out. She'll be back soon. You mean she's left you all alone? She didn't mean to. Something unexpected came up. Tell her to call me as soon as she gets back. The number's on the pad. Yes, Mom. Bye mom. Anthea, you promise me you do not go outside you lock the door and you do not let any strangers in. I promise. Bye. Hey, look at the time. But that's when we left. We flew to an island, got chased by dinosaurs, lost Helga and the best part is it didn't take any time at all! What do we do next? Nothing. I promissed mom we'd stay in. I didn't promise. I promised for the three of us. Come on Ant. Mom will never know. We have a carpet that can take us anywhere and it doesn't take any real time. It'll be like we never left. But I promised. Fine. We'll ask Phoenix what he thinks. I'm sure he's snoozing as usual. He sure sleeps a lot for a bird that hasn't done anything for two thousand years. Phoenix? Phoenix? He's not in here. I'll go check my room. Wouldn't be surprised if he took off for good. Who'd blame him. No one indeed. Phoenix? Phoenix! Yawn. Ahhh He's here on the waterheater. I found a spot that feels as if the glorious sun of the desert shines ever upon it. Mmmm. Here's the deal Phoenix: we have a carpet that can take us anywhere in the world and Anthea is being a total dweeb about it. I can't go. Not when I've promised Mom. Besides, she always knows when I'm not telling the truth. Try explaining Helga's disappearance to her then. Hey, may be Phoenix can rescue Helga for us? Well, I that is eh You see that particular island No. They didn't exctly hit it off if you remember. Helga would never get back on the carpet with him. No, we've got to do it ourselves. Go ahead. I'll just tell mom you left me all alone. Chicken! Am not! No offence. Just, it'd be wrong to go. Sometimes you think doing something is wrong and sometimes you know. "This is a ""know"" time." "When it is a ""know"" time there is no more to be said" and your noble brothers would never leave you. No, no of course not. Looks like Helga will have to wait. [snoring] [Music] [thunder] Hi eye! I am indeed surprised to find sun-worshippers in such a climate. Eh? Ra's magnificence is somewhat dimmed in this benighted land. Phoenix thinks you are worshipping the God Ra. Ra? Who's Ra? That's the Egyptian Sun-God, duffuss. "That's his ""all-seeing"" eye." "Stop calling me ""duffuss"", braceface." Anyway, this one's way cooler! Ahhh! Psss, psss. Awesome ha? That is an abomination! Told you! "It says here: ""The Serpent Dragon Apep" "epep or something""" Apep, pursuing Ra's fiery bark across the Heavens! "When the Serpent Dragon succeeds _x005F_x000D_ in halting Ra's course there will be storms" "in halting Ra's course there will be storms""" [thunder] Leave it Chris. That painting should be destroyed. But it was Grandpa's. Chill. We'll get rid of it. Phoenix, if we wished for something you could ask the carpet to go and get it, right? That is so. What's the point, we could never agree on anything. Well, then let the carpet decide. Just ask the carpet to return home and bring back some of the most beautiful and delightful products of its native land. I can deal with that. So, are we agreed? Sure, go for it. Em-karim-chi-zekidar-barayema-bi abar Em-karim-chi-zekidar-barayema-bi abar What's the problem? Ugh, this arrogant, concieted, sulky, disobedient Oh, great. A rug with an attitude. [music sting] You think it could've gone forever? We can only hope. [Cats mewing] Hey look! Back already. Cats! Persian cats. Oh, I should've known better than to allow that obnoxious, inanimate object to use its own intiative. This calls for some major planning. Yes, sir! Guys, follow me. And don't let any of them escape. Keep it down, you mangy fur-balls. C'mom Phoenix. We'll need a mountain of catfood. I think we should ask the carpet to take them back. No. I got it! We are saved. Why don't we give them to the A. S. P. R. Or whatever it's called? Don't you think they might ask us where we got all these cats? No. Of course I could be wrong. All right, plan B. Why don't we give them away in the village? We can each take turns so someone is always at home. That's still lying but it's not like we have much choice. If we go two at a time, each carrying one cat, that would be er one hundred Chris, get real. It's a five mile walk to the village. There is no way we can get rid of all the cats before Mom gets back. Hey, may be Mom'll let us keep some of them? No way. I still think we should ask the carpet to take the cats back. Phoenix? [cats mewing] [snoring] Phoenix. If you were to ask the carpet to take the cats back - would it obey? Obey? Certainly. After all a Phoenix is superior er actually, in this particular case No. Plan B it is. Well, better get moving. [Snoring] [Music] Hi! [Music] [Cats mewing] Look Toto! The wicked witch of the West! Chris. Hey look! A burglar? But that's Helga's room. Maybe he's trying to kidnap her? All right! Wait a minute - she is not even there! But Anthea is. Let's call the police. What about Anthea? He might take her hostage. We better go. Come on. [Door lock; cats mewing] [Music] Shhhh. There's a burglar in Helga's room. [laugh] Yeah, sure Chris. It's true. What are we going to do? If we call the cops we won't have time to get rid of the cats before Mom gets home. I know. Why don't we make a citizen's arrest? Sure. You go first. Well, er I think we should all go together. We have a better chance. Well, let's do it. If we wait any longer he'll take all Helga's jewels! Jewels? Did you say jewels? Ha. [Music] Freeze! We got you covered! Freeze! We got you covered dirtbag! Hey, what is this? We'll ask the questions, mister. Who are you and what are you doing here? Joe, Joe Worrall. I am a friend of Helga's from college. Yeah? Why did you climb in through the window then? Yeh, I climbed in through the window but that's only because the door was locked. Good answer. What d'you expect a burglar to do - knock? No, pick the lock, braceface. Or? Climb through the window? Good answer. Ow? Prove you are not a burglar. Listen, is there anything missing? When did you ever hear of a burglar sneaking into somebody's room ro read Cosmopolitan Anyway, ask Helga if you don't believe me. Easy to say when she isn't even here. Well she asked me to come over today. So where is she? She went out. Something came up and She had to fly! She won't be back till late. Well in that case there's no point in me hanging around much longer. O no you don't. Look kids, I told you. I'm sure the police would love to hear why you came through the window. Yeah? There is only one way you can get out of this without involving the cops. Oh yeah? We'll make you an offer. Yeah, we'll make you an offer you can't refuse. Huh... Look kids, I swear to you I am not a burglar. I am Helga's boyfriend. Oh yeah? This is Helga's boyfriend. Doesn't look a bit like you. May be we should let the police decide. OK. I give in. What's the deal? [Cats mewing; Sneeze] Oh, great. A cat burglar allergic to cats! I am not a burglar. [Sneeze] But I am allergic to cats. [Cats mewing] Promise you'll find good homes for every single one of them? Scout's honor. Is that the lot? Yep, that's all of them. Where did you find them? We said no questions remember? All right. If you see Helga tell her to call me, all right? Sure. We will. Yeah. I think my plan worked, don't you? Your plan? It was my idea. Well, actually guys, you know it was my idea in the first place / No way. I saw him first [Cats mewing; Sneeze] [Screeching breaks] [Police siren] [Cats mewing; Sneeze] [Police siren] [Screeching breaks] This is going to be a bit difficult to explain. [Police siren; Cats mewing] Yep, cops got him all right. Oh, no. Oh, great. Hey, wait up! Why? What are they gonna do to him? I know! They'll throw him in a dungeon at the tower of London! Chris! We should call the Police and explain. And say what? It's not what you think, officer. These cats just arrived on a Magic Carpet from Persia! [Sigh] [footsteps] Joe's been arrested by the cops. [mumble] Ohhh, yes well there you are, yes... Look at that! Those cats ripped the carpet to shreds. If Mom sees it like this she'll probably take it away. Then we'll never get Helga back! We tried, bro, we tried. [slap hands; giggle] Oh, you two are bad. [giggle]Hmmm, yes Well, there is only one thing to do. We'll have to fix it. [Music] There. That doesn't look so bad from a distance. Just hope Mom doesn't get too close. Your mother is even now returning home. Her carriage approaches. Wait. What are we going to say about Helga? Nothing. We'll pretend we're tired and we want to hit the sack early. May be she'll buy it. Then what? Then, we have a busy night ahead of us. I am home guys. Hi Mom. Hi sweety. [kiss] Where's Helga? Why hasn't she called me? She's not here. She's not back yet? Did she say where she was going? Say where she was going? No, she didn't say where she was going. I can't believe she's left you guys alone this long! Humm. Something must've happened. I'm going to call the Police. Oh, don't do that! She probably got side-tracked. And anyway the Police can't do anything. She's an adult, remember. It's not like she's been missing for days or anything. Now that I think about it may be she did tell us where she was going but we didn't pay attention. Why don't you have some tea? Then rest. You look tired. Dad'll be here tomorrow. He can help you. Helga will probably show up first thing in the morning. Aha. She'd better. [music; dogs barking] [Snoring] You know Phoenix, I don't like keeping secrets from Mom Doesn't seem right not to share some of the magic with her. In my experience it's usually quite difficult to get grownups to share wonderful secrets. Hm. Well, I'm going to do what's right. I am going to tell her the truth. [Snoring] She is not there with you, is she? Can't imagine where she could be. Kids are acting very weird. No, I don't think she'd go back to Germany she doesn't get along with her dad. Paul doesn't get here till tomorrow. O.K. Thanks. Bye. Mom. Yes, Anthea. I know where Helga is. You do? Well, she's You know the carpet in Grandpa's study Hhhm. Well, turns out it's a Magic Carpet. Chris found an egg in one of Grandpa's trunks and it fell into the fire and it hatched into a golden Phoenix, that's a bird that lives for five hundred years. Anyway, the carpet took us to this tropical island You know Anthea, you have a wonderful imagination and I really love to hear your stories but right now I am a little preoccupied. But Mom, it's true! And you shouldn't say that! (quietly) Phoenix was right. You know I hmm.. I am a little bit tired. May be we should talk about this in the morning. Anthea. Yes, Mom. Helga used to talk about going to Australia with her pin-up boyfriend? Well, I guess she would've left me a note. I guess so. [Music] [Thunder] [Music] [whisper] All clear. C'mon. Tarraa! [laughter] It's Grandpa's safari suit. [Thunder] Right Phoenix, let's go. Perhaps we should postpone our journey until we have more clement weather? But we have to rescue Joe and get Helga back before tomorrow. Anyway, it's bad luck to turn back. Bad luck is often an excuse for lack of common sense. Mara-beharonte-biraba OK. Phoenix. Police station first stop, please. [Music][thunder] AhOh I don't feel so good. Everything's blurry Probably those sausages you scoffed down for dinner. Ahh I keep seeing bits of Grandpa's study mixed up with the sky. O, it's not the sausages. It's the thread-bare state of our temperamental friend here. The thread! We used regular thread. But it wasn't regular thread, it was polyester super-stitch! May be we need Magic thread to fix the carpet. May be we should go back. Ohhh. I feel dizzy. Ohhh. [thunder] Ohhh! Chris! Help me! Help! Help! Aaaghhhhh! [Mumble] Oh, good one! Thanks Phoenix. [Mumble] You are welcome. What did you say? I said oh you are welcome Aaghhh! Help me! [Music] What are you guys trying to do, suffocate me? Chris? Where are you? Are you all right? I was fine until you dweebs landed on top of me. Are you sure you are O.K. No broken bones? No way. It was so cool. I was falling through the trees grabbing at the branches - just like Tarzan! [Tarzan call] Never thought you'd get out of that one buddy. He did actually have a little assistance from a friend, too modest to expect gratitude. Thanks Phoenix. Huh. You are welcome. Now, you two going to help me up or are we going to sit here all night talking about it? Sounds good to me - not. [laugh] Get up here. We better abort this rescue mission before we need one for ourselves. Really, it's getting too dangerous. Wimps! It's our only chance. Do I take it that we are ready to continue our mission of mercy? Heck yeah! All right, but don't seat too close to the edge. Let's all hold hands, that way if anybody falls we can pull them back up. Or we'll all fall off together. All those Persian cats! I don't know where they got them from. I couldn't believe it. So you see, it's all been one bad dream really. So you keep saying Joe. But what I don't understand Oh, no, not you lot again! That's gratitude! We are here to bust you out. Oh Lord! Not another one of your deals! Trust me, it'll be O.K. this time. Right Phoenix, let's go. They are kidnapping your prisoner! [Music] Oohohhh It's all right. It's a Magic Carpet, like in fairy tales! Yeah, and I am Aladdin! Oh, I knew Aladdin. He was my friend. Young man, you are not Aladdin. What a clever parrot. That's the Phoenix and he doesn't ike being called a parrot. Sorry Where are we going? To rescue Helga, of course. Of course. I knew that. [music] Look it's morning here already! Actually it's already late afternoon. See Chris. Told you there were different time zones. Never said there wasn't. [laugh] Prepare yourselves for landing in yonder glade. This is your captain speaking we are about to land in yonder glade where it's a beautiful evening of 99 degrees Please fasten your seat belts and extinguish your cigarettes. Thank you for flying Magic Carpet Airways. We always remember - you have the choice. Yeah, sure. Might I suggest that you take the carpet along with you this time. Good thinking Phoenix! I'll fly on ahead. Phoenix always has the best ideas. Wait. I just had a nasty thought. Keep it to yourself. No. What if we run into whatever we ran into before? But we've got Joe with us this time. May be we should've stayed close to the beach. Sure we could've just gone into the water and got eaten by sharks. Can we just argue as we go along. Come on Joe. I think I'm going to wake up any minute. Snap out of it. This ain't no dream. More like a nightmare. [music] [bird song] Time out. Kids. A nice, cold drink would do nicely right now. We didn't bring any drinks. Oh, well, we'll just all die of thirst and end up a big pile of bleached bones. Don't even start! And forget the dinosaurs and hairy spiders too! Come on. [Music sting] Rob! It's all right. It's all right. It's gone now. There could be a whole family of them in there! Warn you, didn't I? Next time it'll be dinosaurs! Aghhh! Ahhh. Got ya! You little Hey! I'll take the carpet. [music] [bird song] (whisper) Excuse me, madam, madam (whisper) I am here to rescue you, dear lady. (whisper) O, I beg of you, try not to draw attention to my presence. Ughh-ha. Oh, where is he? He'll come back. He said he would. He's a bird of his word. May be he ditched us. He wasn't exactly thrilled to come back here. I'm sure he's snoozing somewhere as usual. [Distant Scream] Shhh. I heard something. Snoring? Sounds like a tribe Hey, may be they've got Helga. Good luck to them. But we must rescue her! Come on. Bad idea. We don't know what we are getting into. Come on! [drums] There's no such thing as canibals any more, is there? No, of course not. Too bad. They would've liked Helga. Chris, that's sick. I know. Hey, may be it's just a party going on down there. That doesn't sound like a party to me. Yeah, it sounds more like the circus, when the man is about to put his head into the lion's Human Sacrifice! Chris! Cut it out. [Scream} And you thought I was kidding. Sorry Helga, sweetheart, but my self preservation instinct just got the better of me. Come on! Wait, you guys! We don't speak Old Persian, remember? That could be a problem. Will German do? Try it. ([German) wir woollen nach Hause gehenVolen nacht hauzigen [German] Bitte. [German] Bitte. [German] Heraus! Heraus! Heraus! So much for that. Well, we are stuck here till we find Phoenix. May be he cannot see us for all these branches. If we climb up the tree and wear something white, may be he'll see us then. Great idea. I'll give you a boost. I thought you said you were the best tree climber, Tarzan! I lied. Sue me. [drums][Music] Pssst! I say O why anyone should want to rescue such a foolish maid is beyond me! [Music] Pssst! Pssst! I say [German] Hier, hier ferenzi nicht. Phoo! Ow-woo [Sqeek] [Music; drumming; boiling water] Awesome. You can see for miles up here. Can you see the Phoenix? No, But there's a lot of people down there. Oh-ho Somebody is about to go for the nose dive. You guys've got to see this. Hang on, I'm coming up. [Scream] Aow Aghhh No Rob! [Music; screams][tumbling noises] Oh, no! I thought I got away from you lot! That's gratitude! We are here to rescue you. Helga! My God, it's you Joe. Yep, they know each other. You mean you don't want to be rescued? Rescued? Of course not. I am having a lovely time here. You mean you are not a prisoner? Of course not. These people are very kind. Er, kind enough to pitch people off the platform. They want to do that. They are proving how brave they are. What's the point in being brave when you're dead. Watch. [Drumming] [Scream] [Applause] Come on. You see it's the kind of, how do you say, "a ""tra-di-tion"" a ritual." Chris! [Birds singing] Hmmm. This is better than Australia, eh? Yeah, we shall be happy here. Helga, Mom's worried. You have to come back with us What, back to the housework? No, thank you. I want this dream to last forever. Helga, it's not a dream and it's time to go back. No, I will never step on that carpet again! The carpet! Where's the carpet? It's up on the hill where we left it. We better go get it before Yeah, before someone flies away on it! Helga, you have to come back. If you don't, Mum will call the police and then we'll be in real trouble. If I go back home now the ironing and the cooking will still be waiting for me, ya? I guess so. No, thank you. I prefer to stay here. Smooth Rob. Now what? Helga, if you write Mom a note, telling her you're safe, she probably won't call the cops, then we'll all be off the hook. If I do that, you will go straight back home and leave us in peace, ya? Ya, I mean, we promise. And we'll even try not to miss you too much. Give me a pen and paper, quickly. Here's a pen. Come on, someone must have some paper. I've got this old candy bar wrapper Ughh! That's disgusting. Here's a garage bill, will that do? What you want that I write? Say you're safe and well And put you've gone to Australia. Rob! Is that what I think it is? Helga, where do the people here get the feathers for their head dresses? From birds, of course. Do they kill them first? Sometimes well, sometimes they eat them. Oh, no! There. I finished. You want to hear it? No, it's fine I'm sure. Now what's wrong? I thought you wanted to go home? We can't go anywhere without the Phoenix. We're stuck here forever with Helga! Oh, no. I am going to find that damn parrot wherever it is! Come Joe, let's start looking. And you children - you will wait here! Jawohl! Your vord is my. Everything will be just fine once they are gone. I will be free again. Rob! Look! That's his all right. The wind must've blown it in that direction. Here's another. Wow and another He must be somewhere close. [Music][Jungle sounds] You don't think that's where they Come on. He could still be alive. Come on. [music] Phoenix! [Music] [thunder] Haaahaaahaaa! Ahaa-haa-haa! Oh, foolish bird! Do you really think that I will allow you to escape now after pursuing you over the centuries? Haa-hm. No. Haaahaaahaaa! Now you shall see the fate that awaits all those who follow Ra and worship the powers of light. Haa-hm I own you may have gained a passing victory but the powers of darkness and evil will never prevail against the light! Your own death shall be proof of the triumph of the powers of darkness! Oh, I realize the significance of such a momentous conquest for you but of what importance are these useless beings to you? Useless? Hmm! I beg of you, therefore, o mighty Apep, allow these worthless creatures to crawl away and no longer dishonor you with their presence. Once this temple is cleansed of these unworthy observers I will voluntarily offer myself as a sacrifice to your superior power. No Phoenix! We cannot let you do that! We are not leaving without you! I thank you for recognizing the nobility of my actions but my mind is made up. Haaahaaahaaa! Memorize these words: Mara-foran-behanibebar Now repeat these words Mara-foran-behanibebar Good. Say that to the carpet - it'll take you home safely. And now behold the power of the mighty Apep which can move mountains, well, rocks anyway. [thunder][rolling rock] Goodbye my friends. I pray that my stay with you will have filled in some of the yawning gaps in your education. [thunder][rolling rock] [music] C'mon we have to get to the carpet! [music] [rolling rock][thunder] I have been looking forward to this for such a long time! I wish I could say the same. [Roar] [Roar][Lightning] [explosions] [Music] Wait. We didn't say goodbye to Helga. There's not time now. It's an emergency! C'mon Rob press the pedal to the metal! You didn't forget the words did you? [Roar][Lightning] [explosions] Haaahaaahaaa! I haven't had this much fun for centuries! Haa-aa [Roar][Lightning strike] Recognize your old friend Phoenix? Haaahaaahaaa! What harm have these people done you? They helped you cheat me out of the satisfaction of killing you before. And the carpet. I must not forget to deal with the carpet. Yes..hu-hu-hum [Yawn] I am being bored now Phoenix so I will have to kill you. So be it. Show me what you can do, evil creature! [Roar][Lightning strike] [rocks falling] Mara-foran-behanibebar [Somber music] [Struggling sounds] [Somber music] [Music changes, building to a crescendo] Phoenix! He's escaped! He looks hurt. We gotta help him! Rob, tell the carpet to Oh, no! Carpet go down. Go down. Yes! Yeah! Phoenix you are hurt! We thought you were toast. Oh, that a minor distraction. Is that the end of the Serpent Dragon? That's right Sherlock. I am afraid my victory is only temporary. In that case, could we like kick butt? Kick butt? Yeah, you know like haul ass! One like haul ass coming up. Mara-foran-behanibebar Wait. It's Helga and Joe. They must still be looking for Phoenix. Hey, do you think we're going to miss Helga? Yep, the sooner the better! Phoenix, you were about to Oh, yes indeed Mara-foran-behan ibebar [Music] Wow! That was kicking butt! Thanks Phoenix. You are welcome. Are you all right? It's nothing that a good night's sleep can't restore. Yawn. G'd night Phoenix. Night. Good night everybody. See you in the morning. Night night. Shoes buddy, shoes. [Dawn Cockerel] [Music] Anthea wake up. [sound of curtain drawn] Look. A note from Helga. It was in the kitchen. I can't image that we didn't find it yesterday. That's great. She's on her way to Australia. She's all right and that's all that matters, isn't it? [sigh] No, it isn't. Rob! We need to talk. [whisper] Where's the Phoenix? In there. Mum is still worried. It's all our fault. If she knew what happened last night she'd really be a mess. But we're O.K. This time. The truth is that ever since you-know-what came here it's been nothing but trouble. What are you saying? Well, I don't like saying this but I hate thinking things about you-know-what and not being able to say so because you-know-what would feel when you-know-what knew what you were thinking and wonder what you-know-what did to make you think things like that. Say what!? I think we'll have to send you-know-what away. It's causing too many problems, no matter how wonderful it is. Wait, you want to send Don't say it. We don't want you-know-what to understand what we are saying. I don't even understand what we are saying! He-hemm. The ancient philosophers were well-versed in the art of which you speak. Umm, we were just saying, well no, well sometime, but... well see Well said Rob! I gather you have some unwelcome tidings to communicate to that piece of furntiture about its imminent departure? Well you see I must say I rather expected you might be entertaining such thoughts about our tattered friend here. Ah, it's not long for this world I fear. Sad how some things come to an end. Sometimes the end is peace. I fear that unless it comes soon, the end of your carpet will be pieces! [chuckle] Speaking of peace I have some heart-breaking news for you all. It cannot have escaped your notice that there are evil forces in this world that That are out to get you? We noticed. But they are no match for you Phoenix! Yes, well, be that as it may, I fear that my presence among you is putting your lives in jeopardy. But you saved our lives. Next time we may not fare so well. I have problems enough preserving my own life. I'm weary, I desire to rest. I thought you lived for five hundred years? I fear I may not even see the end of this day. Time is measured in heart-beats. The palpitations I've had since I've known you are enough to blanche the feathers of any bird. All meetings end in partings. I ask of you one last thing. Anything! Can I have the carpet? What will Mom say? Of course, you can have it. I'll take the blame. Me too. You shall not regret it. Now, build me a funeral pyre of sweet-smelling woods and spices. I should also like to impress upon you the urgency of this task. [music][danger sting] [music] [footsteps] Anthea. I'm gonna run down to the village to get us some lunch. I'll be back in about half hour. Please keep an eye on the boys for me. O.K. Mom. [Music ontinues] Now, I beg of you, wrap my egg in the esteemed carpet and I shall send it away where it will not be hatched for another two thousand years! Cool! Jazzire-garm-sireberba [swoosh] Now is the time for parting. Oh, Phoenix, I don't want you to go. The sorrows of youth soon re-appear as dreams. Farewell, my friends. I have loved you well. [Musuc] [Musuc][Fire burning] [Music] Ha-hum. Ahhh. You are most welcome. Oh, thank you. Grandpa? [Giggle] Rob, Anthea, come here! Grandpa? Look. [Music] You saw that, right? You saw that? We got to tell Mom. Chris! Chris! She won't believe you. But I've got proof. Chris! But we promissed never to tell. Yeah, but that was about the egg. So? And this is a feather! Mom! Mom, Mom Oh, that's pretty feather Chris. It's a golden feather from the Phoenix. Aha, sure it is sweetie. But Mom! Told you. Grownups never believe really wonderful things. I know, why don't we all swear never ever to tell any grownups about the Phoenix. It's our secret. Deal? Deal. [Music] {Close your eyes and you might find that forgotten place, locked away in the memories of a child Wondrous days where dreams came true there was no-one there to harm you never thought those days would end how precious years rush by us} [Music and lyrics continue] There are more things in heaven and earth, my friends, than are dreamt of in your technology, That is so. ...to coin a phrase.
