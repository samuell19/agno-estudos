[dramatic music] [Woman On Intercom] Sergeant Ramsay, line 2232. Sergeant Ramsay, line 2232, please. - They want me. - I've got this. Ramsay. What's the model? 7799 agricultural? [computer beeping] [Woman On Intercom] Sergeant Kurtz, please return to your office. Ramsay? - What location? - Oh, this is Marvin, Officer Thompson. - Nice to meet you. - How ya doin'? That's Ramsay, your partner. Ramsay? Your new partner. - Good luck with him. - Thank you. Hi, Jack Ramsay. Karen Thompson. I'm on my way. [Marvin] Some kind of runaway, Jack? Yeah, it sounds like it. Can you order us a copter? - Yeah, I'll take care of it. - Come on, partner. Right now? Well that's Ramsay, if you're gonna keep up with him. You gotta move. Give me the pad, please. I need a chopper for Ramsay. [Man On Intercom] Radio 10. Chopper, pad three. You'll need your gloves and standard Pro-Gs. Standard Pro-Gs? What was your last assignment? Traffic. Did you like it? Well, they told me working with you is a step up from traffic. Maybe. You know anything about robotics and computers? A little. Basics. I was gonna be a data programmer. Do we need all this stuff... to catch a runaway robot? - Jack, your 'copter's on the pad. - Oh, great, Tommy. Let's go, partner. [Man On Intercom] Tad Evans, pick up database line. Lieutenant Evans, pick up database. [birds chirping] [robots whirring] [Karen] Is that it? Yeah, standard agricultural model 7799 pest controller. CPU is an old 8088. Any armament? Just a claw. It's only programmed to look for things smaller than an inch. Could be a problem. [helicopter whirring] You know, you may not need all that stuff. You may just have to throw a switch. That's all? Well, you never know until you get there. [Karen] I guess you've been doing this for a while, huh? Yeah, a couple of years. It's interesting work. Dave, how far away are we? [Dave] Should be almost there. Let's have a look. [computer beeping] Right up there, Jack. [sighing] What do you know? There's a clear runaway track in the field to the left. You okay? Yeah, I'm fine. I just don't like heights. My brother has the same problem. You just take deep breaths. I'm fine. Dave, can you land this sucker? Put on your gloves. - Here they are. - They sure took... - Over here. long enough to get here. [Man] We got work to do around here. - Yeah. Hiya, fellas, what's the problem? They're running a zigzag course. I'm not going in that field after it. Fuel cells will blow up in your face out there. You go on in there and take a look. Have you had this thing serviced? Service regular. Isn't that what you're getting paid for? You skedaddle in there. [robots whirring] Oh, there you are. Yay! - [sparks zapping] - Uh-oh. - I seen that coming. - [all laughing] - You okay? - Yeah. Let's get him. [dramatic music] [robot beeping] [gasps] [robot zapping] - [robot explodes] - Whoa! World War III! [Man] I think they got it. [Farmer] Yeah, I could've done the same thing with my .22. [Man] Yeah, we could've blown the damn thing up. Golly. - Yeah, there it is. - It's all yours, fellas. - Thanks a lot. - Alrighty. How long did you say you've been doing this? [chuckles] I just sort of fell into it by accident. Then I kind of liked it, so I took some night courses in robotics, APL, that sort of thing. And then all of a sudden, I just seemed to know more about it than anybody else. Didn't you ever wanna work the regular force? This is the regular force. You mean working the streets? Yeah, I used to do that. I had to stop. Because of vertigo? Yeah, I don't like heights. I've had it all my life. Anyway, I just decided it wasn't a good idea to work the streets with that kind of fear. I don't know, I figured you wouldn't run into a situation like that very often. I mean, you could probably work the streets for years... Yeah, well I just decided I'd rather do this. - Hey, Jack, Lois called. - Leave a message? - Nope. - Can you call her back? [Dave] Sure. [helicopter whirring] Lois? I'm fine, thank you. How are you? No, whatever you wanna fix is fine. Oh, that sounds good. No, I don't think I'll be late. Okay, bye. Why did Jack quit the regular force? [Karen] Yeah, why'd he quit, Marvin? What'd he tell you? He told me because of vertigo, but I don't believe him. Well, it's true, in a way. A few years back, Jack was chasing this guy. Bad guy. This guy ran into a building that was under construction. Jack freaked out, started sweating. Couldn't follow him. The guy got away. So a guy got away. Yeah, well later that night that same guy killed six people. A family up in Ridgemont. But that isn't Jack's fault. Yeah, I know. He can't blame himself for that. Things like that happen. Yeah, well, he does. It's always on his mind. The guy that got away, that Jack let get away, he never wants to let anything or anybody get away from him ever again. Is that why he's a robot expert? [Marvin chuckles] Well, I think he feels a lot safer doing this work. Now, why do you do what you do? Oh, long story. I was gonna be a dancer, but I hurt my knee. Then I was gonna be a data programmer, but I didn't like sitting down. - Then I started to be a nurse. -[alarm beeping] Runaway 2, we have a 709 alert. So then I went to the Police Academy. [Woman On Intercom] Runaway 2, we have a 709 alert. - Did I miss something? - Runaway 2, Runaway 2, we have a 709 at Fifth and Sumter. 709 at Fifth and Sumter. What does 709 mean? It means people have died. [Karen] Oh, God! [lights whirring] [chattering on police radio] [baby crying] [chattering on police radio] [sirens blaring] - Hey, Jack. - What do you got, Jerry? A model 912 cut up two people inside the house, Wife and her sister. Bodies are over here. They managed to run out before they died. Anything else? Yeah, there's a 10-month-old kid inside. - Dead? - Not yet. The kid's in a crib. Maybe that's why, but it hasn't touched the kid yet. We gotta save that kid, Jack. Tell me. What was the weapon? Pathologist said it was probably an ordinary kitchen knife. We wanted to keep them here for you to see. Well, we better get them out of here now, or they'll headline the evening news. What have you done so far? Power and utilities cut, white light bath, white sound bath. - Floater? - Not yet. - Can you prep one for me? - Right now. What have you got on the 912? It's a new domestic model. Does housework, cooks meals, answers doors, stuff like that. - Run on house current? - Batteries. - What kind of sensors? - Audio and visible range. Sees and hears everything. Great. - Is it standard? - May be modified. Anytime you change these things, who knows how they'll behave? The father's over there. Electronic engineer, name of Johnson. [cries] [chattering on police radio] Hey, you got that floater yet? [Man] We're programming it now, sir. Sergeant Ramsay, we'd like a direct feed off your floater. I'm sorry, Miss Shields, that's impossible. Well the public has a right to know. Not tonight, we got a 10-month-old baby in there. The rest of the family's been cut up pretty bad, and we don't know when or if the 912 can attack the child, but if it does, I'm sure you don't want a carved-up baby on your network, do you? [Shields] I feel we can be the judge of what's newsworthy. Yeah, I know. Not tonight. There you have it, the first confirmation from Sergeant Ramsay of the Runaway Squad. That there is a baby inside the house, still alive. Police are preparing a floater camera which will enter the house to locate in an attempt to locate the runaway 912 and the infant. [camera whirring] [chattering on police radio] [sighs] [ominous music] [chattering on police radio] I can't see enough, lights on in the house, Jerry. [Jerry] Hit the house lights. - Where's the baby? - Crib's in the playroom... near the back. How big's this 912, anyway? [Karen] About the size of a hatbox. - Look there. - It dropped the knife. [Karen] Maybe the battery power's fading. Maybe. - [ominous music] - [chattering on police radio] [gun firing] [window shatters] You get an audio on that? Yeah, confirmed all three sounds as a .357 Magnum. - The bastard's got a gun. - [baby crying] [Jerry] Now what? - I'm going in. - What do you mean you're going in, we can send a disarm robot in. - It hit the floater it'll hit the disarm, and any minute it's gonna decide to hit the kid. Look, I want light lines out here. No audio, no talk, no radio, no nothing. I don't want it picking up what we're doing. Mr. Johnson? Mr. Johnson? I'll be going in your house soon to get your baby. What modifications were made to the robot? I didn't make any modifications. I didn't touch that thing. Then why has it gone out of control? Well, how should I know? You think I should have some idea why it's doing this? Why should I know? Hey, come on, take it easy, I'm just asking. Well, don't ask, I don't know! Well what about the gun? - It's got a gun? - Yes. Oh, my God, he's crazy. Who's crazy? My God, he's crazy. Who's crazy? No television, no pictures! I won't be on television! No pictures! No television! What was his problem? Yeah, he was really upset. That was very hot stuff. [baby crying] [chattering on police radio] Sgt. Ramsay is wearing his electromagnetic scatter suit. He apparently is going in. Sergeant Ramsay, what is your next move now? [Jack] I really can't say. Well it looks as if you're going into the house after the robot. - Is that right? - Miss Shields, you're broadcasting on an electromagnetic frequency... that the robot reads. [Shields] Let's get out of here, John. [Officer On Radio] Got a third call that no gun was seen. [chattering on police radio] [gun zaps] [suspenseful music] [clock ticking] [robot whirring] This is very exciting. Our own John Wilson is actually accompanying Sgt. Ramsay into the house for exciting live coverage of the runaway robot. [robot whirring] [sighs] [robot whirring] [John coughs] [robot whirring] [baby crying] [gun fires] [baby crying] [suspenseful music] [dramatic music] [robot whirring] [baby crying] [robot whirring] [pump clacks] [gun fires] [baby crying] [dramatic music] [pump clacks] - [gun fires] [laser zaps] [suspenseful music] [robot whirring] [robot whirring] [door clacks] [door creaks] [gun fires] [dramatic music] [gun fires] - [robot whirring] - [baby crying] I'm coming out with the kid. [dramatic music] [baby crying] It's all right, darling. [crowd cheering] [chattering on police radio] You okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Here you go. Where's the father? He disappeared. - He disappeared? - Yeah. With his own kid still in there? [Shields] After two tense hours and the tragic death of a KBEX cameraman, it was finally all over when Sgt. Ramsay... came out of the house - Hello? [Shields] with the child safe in his arms. That was great! See, they're running it again. You're on instant replay! Hi, guy. Bobby, this is Karen. I know, you're his new partner. Nice to meet you, Bobby. I saw you on TV too, but you didn't go in the house. Wow, it was neat when Dad went in there. I'll bet you wished you could go in there too, huh? - Well... - it was pretty scary. I watched the whole thing. How come the father ran away? Didn't he wanna see his baby safe? [Jack] We were just talking about that. It seems pretty funny to me, Dad. I think you oughta pick the guy up for questioning. - When you hear the tone, - Well, we're looking at it. ...the time will be 10.45, Were you scared? - You bet I was scared. - [robot beeps] - Which is exactly one hour... - But you did it anyway, - right? and 45 minutes past your bedtime. Aw, Lois! This is a weeknight. Tomorrow is a school day. - I know, Lois, but... - Hey, Bobby, Lois is right, to bed. Okay. - Nice meeting you. - Nice meeting you too, Bobby. - Do you like sports? - Sure. Bobby, bed. - Good night, Dad. - Good night, son. Good night, Bobby. He is adorable. - How about a beer? - Got anything diet? - No. - Soda? [Lois] I will verify that Bobby brushes his teeth. Excuse me. So that's Lois. Will all those phone calls, I thought Lois was your wife. Sometimes she thinks she is. Or my mother. Do you have a wife? She died. Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't know. It was a couple of years ago. Car crash. But Lois is a big help. What is she, a Series 10? No, a Series 12. Ooh, Series 12's are much better. Yeah, a lot of Series 10's were lemons. [laughs] My mother had a Series 10 that kept burning all the toast. Started all these fires. Lois is pretty reliable. [Lois] Bobby is eating a chocolate bar. His dinner, too, was nutritionally inadequate. What did you give him, Lois? [Lois] Hot dogs. Lois, you can't keep giving him hot dogs. [Lois] It is all he would accept. Did he do his homework? [Lois] Yes, he got an A in math today. Will your guest be staying for dinner? Me? Oh, you're welcome if you'd like. [Lois] You are welcome if you would like. No, thank you. - It's no trouble, really. - It is no trouble, really. Lois, I was talking to her. - Excuse me, Sergeant. - Well, actually, I better go. - You sure? - Yeah. Thanks for the juice. [Lois] May I show you to the door? [Karen] Oh, that's okay, Lois. I can find my way. Well, I'll see you tomorrow. [Lois] Will I see you tomorrow? [Jack] No, Lois, she was talking to me. [Lois] Excuse me, Sergeant. I'll see you tomorrow. - Good night. - Good night. [Lois] Is that someone to be put in memory? Yes, she's my new partner. [Lois] How should she be listed? As Karen or Officer Thompson. [Lois] Very well. There is a power surge from Bobby's room. I'll take care of it. [Man On Recording] The next dinosaur giant is brontosaurus, "thunder lizard." Like the other two giants, she's a peace-loving plant-eater. She is not as heavy as the Brachiosaurus, but she does - Hey. ...weigh three tons. - Come on, tiger. - And she is 67 feet long. Lights out. [gentle music] Oh, Dad. Is she still here? No, she's gone home. She's nice. Do you like her? Well, sure, I like her. She's my partner. Does she have a husband? I don't know. She didn't have a ring on. You noticed, huh? It wouldn't kill you to get married again, you know. I know, and it wouldn't kill you to go to sleep. Come on, tiger. Hey, Dad? - What? - Were you really scared in there? Sure I was. Was there blood and stuff like that? Were you really scared? Me? Not me. Not even just a little? Well, a little. That's okay. But everything is fine now. That's right. Everything's fine. Good night, son. [Bobby] Hey, Dad? Yeah? Would Lois ever go crazy like that other robot? No, never. Sleep now. Good night. [Lois] Dinner is served. This concludes the menu for today. Reminder, I have not received the menu for tomorrow. [Woman On Intercom] Emergency phone call for Captain McNichol. Captain McNichol, emergency phone call. - Son of a bitch! - What is it? We got a non-standard chip here. You see that red stripe? It's not a regular commercial chip. It didn't come with the robot when it was sold. Damn sophisticated, though. I don't know, maybe it's experimental. What's it do? [Marvin] Looks like some hard-wired instructions. I'm not sure. So the 912 was modified. Definitely. The guy at the house, he said it wasn't modified. Well, maybe somebody else did it, and he didn't know about it. [circuit hissing] Oh, we got a dense pack! - Floor! - Floor! [circuit explodes] Assholes. [Woman On Intercom] There is a high level of smoke in the room. Please be careful. What was that? Monodichromate dense pack, the arson special. What the hell is this all about, Jack? I don't know. This isn't a runaway. This is murder. Hey, Jack, you got a call. You're gonna love it. [workers chattering] [machinery clattering] Great. He said you were gonna love it. [sparks zapping] Come on, this way, guys. Careful. You have a lot of robots here. This is nothing. You should see the construction project over on Main. There aren't any people working there at all, just hundreds of robots. No coffee breaks, no union hassles. So, what's the problem? [sand bag explodes] Stacker. Gone nuts! It's stacking where there's no place to stack. [sand bag explodes] It's on the 18th floor. Come on, I'll show you. Why don't you just shut if off yourself? Have one of your people do it. Our insurance doesn't cover it. It looks pretty open. [Woman] Robots don't need doors. Come on. What do you say I take this one? Yeah, I think this one's all yours. No problem. I worked construction at one time. Of course. [sand bag explodes] I'm on the 18th floor. It's pretty windy up here. I can see the stacker now. We're gonna look for... [static] I found the junction box, we can't find the switch. I got it! No problem! I turned it off! Jack, do you read me? I got it! Think it's better than it used to be when people did all this work? Sure. But machines always break down. Let me tell you the way the world is. Nothing works right. Relationships don't work right, People don't work right. People make machines, so why should machines be perfect? Because they're machines. Yeah? Well, that's not the way it is. [chattering on police radio] Hi, Sally. Hi, Jack. How's the new car? It's in the shop. You're kidding. Did you check the door recorder? No, not yet. Is it clean in here? Yeah, it's clean. [recorder beeping] Hi, Mary. It's Sally. I guess you're not home. I just came by to see if you wanted to go to that ceramics class tonight. Give me a call me when you get in. Bye. [recorder beeps] Hi, Dave? I'm a little nervous about our project and meet me at the office, will you? It's important, really. Okay? Okay. [recorder beeps] This is Acme Robot Repairs. - We got a call in the office - [ominous music] That one of your 912's was not functioning, and I'm... It's been erased. Yeah, but not completely. This is Acme Robot Repairs. We got a call in the office that one of your 912's was not functioning, and I'm... I wanna know who this guy is. Beautiful, just beautiful. [Man] I'm glad you're satisfied, Dr. Luther. Satisfied? I'm delighted, I'm ecstatic. Oh, that's good, good! Where are the chips? You have to be very careful with these chips, Dr. Luther. They're very dangerous. I know they are. That's why they're so valuable. Valuable to whom? The Mafia, terrorist organizations, foreign agents. Anyone who'll offer me the most money. Well then, how about my money? Harry, these aren't all the chips. And where are the templates to make more? The rest of the chips and templates are locked in a company safe. We'll give you the key after Johnson and I get paid. Have you seen Johnson? [Harry] No. He didn't come in today. It's terrible, what happened to his family. It's a tragedy. Would you like me to pay now, Harry? I really would. I thought so. I brought the money with me. [robot beeping] Sentry, on rounds! Dr. Luther? [dramatic music] Damn, evil son of a bitch! [robot clattering] [screams] [robot explodes] Are you sure he's still in there? Checked in an hour ago. I bet he's the only electrical engineer there. Yeah, what room? 404, fourth floor. [Luther] Coffee, black. Keep an eye on the elevator. [alarm blaring] [gun firing] Police! Drop it, Johnson! - Okay. - Now! Yeah, okay! You are the cops. Who were you expecting? Nobody. Yeah, right, you got a suitcase all packed. You got an alarm and you got a gun. You got a permit for this? Come on. What are you gonna do? [Jack] Take you down to the station for questioning. Sorry. Is this about the robot? Yeah, it's about the robot. Come on. You're crazy, I can't go out there. Why not? I'm telling ya, I can't go out there! - Sure you can, go on. - I can't go out! No. [dramatic music] Dispatch, this is Runaway 2, Runaway 2. [horn blares] What the hell are you trying to do, Johnson? Come here. [gun fires] [gun fires] [Karen] We're the police! [screams] [body thuds] [sirens wailing] He had different eyes. Is that him? Face was narrower, and, uh the eyes were squintier. More like that? Pretty close. That's a lot like him. That's good. Jesus. [chattering on police radio] It's picking up diphenyl compounds and tetrahydrocarbons. The tetras are explosive and the diphenyls are a solid propellant like they use in rockets. How big did you say these missiles were? About that big. And they went around corners? Yeah. Who was this guy? His name's Johnson, electronic engineer. You know where he worked? A company called Vectrocon. [Computer] Welcome to Vectrocon Security Systems. A retinal identification check is required to proceed. [sighs] Retinal identification is now being carried out. Thank you for your cooperation. Retinal identification is now confirmed. How can we help you, Sergeant Ramsay? I need data files. [Computer] Data files for what person or subject? - Employee David Johnson. - One moment, please. Allow me to search the records. That's a pretty good voice. What is it, a 5590? Yeah, it's a 5590 processor, but with a Z-77 phonetic ROM. Gives it that lifelike tone. [Computer] Thank you for waiting, Sergeant. David "Dave" Johnson is 32 years old. He has been with the company four years. A graduate of Mountain Polytech in electronic engineering. He has worked on several projects for this company. The Vectrocon Security System, the Phantom Stealth Missile, and the Stingray laser-guided smart bomb. For the past year, he has worked in the Special Projects Division. In his spare time, Dave enjoys skiing, biking and water sports. This is just a standard PR bio. Sure, what'd you expect? Well, it's no good to me. [Computer] That is what you requested. What do you wanna know? Well, this Vectrocon Security Project. What about that? [Computer] That information is classified by the company. You keep quiet. [Computer] Do you wish to disconnect? No, how do I find out about this project? - We have a call. - Have another - Wilson? ...unit take it. - Yeah, but our call... - Yeah, listening. is right here. - On my way. - On here? - Yeah. - In this building? You guys wanna handle this? It seems like we got a runaway. Sure. [robot whirring] All right! Hello? Anybody there? - Hello? - Who is she? Jackie Rogers, one of the executive secretaries. [Jackie] Hello? Can anybody hear me? We hear you, Miss Rogers. This is Sergeant Ramsay of the Runaway Squad. Well will you guys get me out of here? This damn robot won't let me pass. He's already zapped me twice. Can you see that? You just sit tight, Miss Rogers. - She's very attractive. - Yeah. Is she supposed to be in there? Maybe she's just working late. Let's see the runaway. A 577 Sentry? Yeah, 577 with office-checking routines on board. Got it. Insulated wheels, steel hull. Delivers taser shocks only? - Yeah. - Standard issue? Yeah, we don't modify them. We just run them as they come from the factory. Supposed to voice-inactivate with a code. Do you know the code? Mm-hmm. Sentry, input, Vetro. Zip off, 891, clipper. I've already tried that. It isn't responding to voice codes. You know what's wrong with these sentries, the internal temperatures get too high, and they pop their chips right off the motherboard. It's a design defect. [Jackie] Would you guys please do something? - [current zapping] - [yelps] All this thing can do is deliver shocks? - Yeah. - What level? Sting level only. Irritating, but it can hurt ya. No bio, cardiac, nothing. Want me to get the insulation and padding from the car? [Jack] No. Are you sure, this robot is shocking at a high level. - I'll knock this baby off quick, Miss Rogers, this is Sergeant Ramsay, I'll be right with you. You two, deal with this robot. You just sit tight. [Jackie] Thank you, Sergeant Ramsay. I thought you guys got all armed and protected before you went up against a runaway. I think he's in love. [robot whirring] - Hello. - Hi. You just stay put, Miss Rogers. This will only take a minute. You better watch out for him. I think I know what I'm doing. - [current zaps] - [Jack gasps] [Karen] It's not set for sting level, it's set for stun. I noticed. [Karen] Do you want the padding now? No. [robot whirring] Uh-oh. - [current zapping] - [Jack gasping] Are you all right, Sergeant? [Jack] I'm fine. - [head bangs on desk] - [Jack groans] [robot whirring] Is this the way you usually do it? Sure. What are you doing? [current zapping] [grunting] Hey, you didn't have to do that! Judgment call. That was a new jacket. Yeah, but the Sentry's ruined. I'm gonna have to report this. We'll have to check your maintenance records, and if there's any irregularities, we'll shut down all your machinery as hazardous for a 60 day inspection period. Are you all right, Miss Rogers? [Jackie] I'm fine, thank you. Well, I'll just see you to the door. - No, that's fine, thanks. - No, I insist. You've done more than enough already. It's all in the line of duty. I mean, here you are working late at night all by yourself. I just had a few things to finish up. - No, I insist. - It's no big deal. - Let me help you. - No, really. [chips clattering] [dramatic music] - What are these? - It's not my fault. He made me do it, he made me get them from the vault. - Who did? - Luther. They're his chips! I don't have anything to do with this. [Jack] Uh-huh. He said he would kill me if I didn't get 'em for him tonight! He said he would kill me just the way he killed Johnson and all the others. He's evil, I'm telling you! Where's this Luther now? - A meeting. - What meeting? I don't know, please, I'm not involved. Where is he? The Ritz Hotel. - Ritz Hotel. - He's in the presidential suite. There's two guys with him and two girls. They've got an EVS scrambler on and running water, so we can't hear or see shit. You know where in the suite they are? We can't determine the location without a active probe and they'll pick that up. You using passives only? Yeah, passives only. You got all the exits and elevators covered? We don't have enough people to cover the exits. Look, this guy's a killer. I'm not gonna let him get away. [chattering on radio] Something's going on in there. - I better go in. - You taking responsibility? Yes. - You okay about this? - Yeah, fine. You sure? It's more interesting than traffic. Okay. Now I'm gonna go in first and when you hear me, you come in. - Okay. [suspenseful music] [voice muffled] Honey, did I leave my purse out there? Hey? Did I leave my purse out there or not? Are you listening to me? He's not even there. [dramatic music] Don't shoot, please. Please don't shoot. - Please, don't, no! - Come on, now. Nobody move. Nobody move. Just stay cool, everything's gonna be just fine. Oh, shit. You said there wasn't gonna be any trouble. Nobody move. Jack? Right here. Okay, let's take it easy. Everybody move real slow, and we won't have any trouble. [robot whirring] [gas hissing] [all coughing] [dramatic music] Hey! [gun fires] [gasps] [gun firing] Drop it, sucker. Luther. [suspenseful music] I said, "Drop your gun." I'm not kidding, asshole. Drop your gun. Please. [woman cries] [gun clacks] Now kiss your ass goodbye! [gun fires] - [guns firing] - [dramatic music] Police, hold it! [gun fires] [officer screams] I'm okay, get him. [woman cries] - Where? - The stairs! Officer down, inside! Call for backup! [suspenseful music] [Man On Speaker] The roof, they're on the roof! [dramatic music] [woman whimpers] [helicopter whirring] [woman sobbing] It's all right, it's all right. You're okay. [Billy] Okay, the coroner's office has authorized the removal of the bodies. - Come on. - She's a witness, Billy. Okay, Jack. Sergeant Ramsay, may we have a word with you, please? - Go away. - I'm interested in knowing later. I wanna talk to you, - Ramsay. - Chief. [Shields] Chief, do you any further comment at this time? [Chief] No, Miss Shields, I have no comment right now. - How is it, kid? - Fine. Didn't even break any bones. They're gonna bring me to the hospital. I guess they're gonna take the bullet out there. Take it out there? Yeah, that's right, Sergeant. Gotta take it out there in case she starts bleeding. But you can't move her. - Ramsay? - Just hold on a minute. Come here. Now you take a look at that screen again. That is not a bullet in her arm. It's an unexploded micro-shell. It can go off anytime. God, you're right. It can blow her whole arm off if it detonates. That's right, now you gotta take it out here. You cannot move her. Ramsay, the chief wants your ass. I know. Hey. You just sit tight, kid. Even/thing's gonna be fine. I'm trying not to breathe. You do that. [Officer] It's not involved in this case. Better hang on to it, anyway, and then we'll take a look at it. - Boy, that's a mess. - Hey, Ramsay, Ramsay, look at this, look. You know those two dead hoods? - Yeah. - We got a make off the prints. Tommy "The Kid" Arcaro, degree in electrical engineering from Cal Tech. - Great. - And Luigi Bandini, degree in solid state physics from M.l.T. I figured these guys are high-tech shoppers. But what are they buying? - That's a good question. - Now, Ramsay! Get over here, Ramsay, get over here! Just who the hell do you think you are running an operation like this? - It's my operation. - Oh, it's a runaway operation? No runaways in that room. - Yeah, but we've been after... - You screwed up good, Ramsay. We've got two dead officers, do you understand me, mister? Two dead cops! And we got two wounded, one of them your own partner. And we got two dead Guinea punks! And nobody knows why or what the hell it's all about! I know what it's about. - It's about this. - Yeah, what is this? It's some kind of new bullet, It's more like a guided missile, chief. It can go. What the hell is this?! Disarm robot. There's somebody in there with an unexploded fragment. I know, but you can't use that thing on her! - Well, they sent for it. - You can't use this thing on her, they screw up all the time. We have to use it. It's a live shell. It'll screw up! It'll blow her arm off. Can't you get a CVD? There are no CVD's available. Look at this thing, it's over a year old, and they were never any damn good to begin with! Jesus Christ, Ramsay, you've got a hell of a nerve to complaining! Haven't you done enough for one day? [sighs] I'll get the bullet out. - You? - Yeah! I'll disarm the goddamn bullet. Get this thing out of here! All right, clear out, we got a disarm job. Clear out! Can you get them to clear the room? Look, I want Tensolite shields! I want blast pads, and I wanna clear the fucking room now! Ramsay, you're on television! I don't give a shit. Get that thing out of my face. All right, all right, get out! Clear it out, Ladies, down here, I'll give you a statement down here. The public has a right to know... - Let's go, get out! what's going on with this situation. - Yes, I will give the public a statement. What's this? Remote TV. Of course. Okay, guys, let's clear out. Better get away from the door. [group chattering] [machinery beeping] How we doing, kid? [Karen] Okay. I heard the news. Yeah? Well, don't sweat it. You don't have to do this, Jack. Yeah, I know. [Karen] You can let the robot do it. I wouldn't miss this for the world. Okay, just hold real still. That's it. - Too tight? - No, it's okay. Oh, God. Okay, I want you to sit back and take it real easy. This is gonna hurt like a mother. Just real easy. Just turn your arm just a little. [groans] Real slow, that's it. That's good. [sighs] Okay, whatever you do, don't move your arm. I'll try and remember. Don't you need your glasses for this? You want me to run down the car and get 'em? [Karen chuckles] [gasps] Breathe it, kid. Hold still! Come on kid, breathe it. That's it, just keep breathing. Hold still. [breathing heavily] That's it. Come on, kid. Breathe it, that's it. Easy. [wincing] Ah. [breathing heavily] Did you get it? Not yet. Oh, jeez, can't you do anything right? [Jack] I'm doing the best I can. Listen, it's gonna be okay. Heard any jokes lately? [gasps] Come on, kid. Hold on, hold on, come on, hold still. [Karen gasps] Breathe it, that's it, I can see it. [Karen groans] - Breathe it, Karen. - Oh, God! Come on. [gasping] I can see it. - It's almost there. - [shrieks] Come on. There! [bullet explodes] [dramatic music] [crying] Shh. It's okay, shh, shh, shh. [women chattering] You didn't need to wait, Jack. I'm fine. Well, I was worried about you. I'm fine, really. Hurt much? No, not really. Bet it does. Jack, I'm fine. What do you say we have dinner tonight? - Dinner? - Yeah. Sure, I gotta go home and change, though. No, you can go just like that. I can't go to the restaurant like this. Oh, we're going to my place. Oh. Okay. I think we should get to know each other better. I love it. It's a good idea for partners to spend some time with each other away from work. Oh, definitely, I think you're right, yeah. We'll go over the usual, office routines, you know, station procedures. I mean, there's a lot of things you're gonna need to know. The chief isn't the easiest guy to get along with. I always take my new partners to dinner. Oh, you do? Just because you're a woman shouldn't make any difference, right? Right. Well, listen, I really appreciate the gesture, but I think I wanna go home tonight. Why not dinner? [scoffs] Just forget it. [robot whirring] [Lois] The pasta will be al dente in exactly two minutes, 17 seconds. Forget it, Lois. [Lois] Where's your guest for dinner? - Just forget it. - She forget it? No, she didn't forget it. I'm asking you to forget it. [Lois] Very well, I will erase it from memory. You do that. [Lois] Bobby stayed up to say good night to you. [gentle music] Dad. Hi, son. I saw you on TV. Oh, yeah? I know you didn't mean it. Mean what? What you said. The words that you said that you say I can't say. Yeah. - Well, you see... - I know. You didn't know what you were saying because you were just worried about her. Well, that's true. But that's not an excuse. Sometimes... Just don't let it happen again. I'll try. Did she come here tonight? [both laugh] No, she went home. [Lois] Excuse me, Sergeant. They want you at the police station. Oh. [laughs] I gotta go. Okay. You go to sleep. Good night, son. Yes, sir. [both laugh] - Good night. - Good night. [air hissing] [Man On Intercom] Vehicle recovery on three-six. Jack, look at this. The back half is all solid propellant. There are different valves for directional control. The nose, it's all electronic. You've heard of a bullet that has your name on it? Well this one really does. And you can program it to go after a certain person. What's its signature? I don't know, man, I've tried everything. Movement, light, shape. - I don't know. - I gotta know, Marvin. Yeah, I know you gotta know! I'm doing my best, okay? It's tricky. [machines beeping] Heat. My God. It's a heat-seeking missile. Yeah, but Marv, they come right at a specific person. Sure. Because everyone's body has its own unique heat pattern. This is your body's heat pattern and this is mine. [Jack] Clean, simple and neat. Jack, this is a police nightmare. We used to worry about terrorists and crooks getting A-bombs? The real problem is this microelectronics stuff like this. I mean, a smart bullet? What about these chips? Overrides all CPU instructions. It can turn any domestic computer into a killing machine. [Chief] Charles Luther. - Is this the guy? - Yeah, that's him. This is a bad guy. Served one to three, armed robbery. Arrest, murder two, no conviction. Arrest for assault with a deadly weapon, conviction overturned. Mob connections. He's a rich kid gone bad. What's he doing with Johnson? I figure Luther got Johnson and Harry to design the chips, knocked 'em off, and ran away with the stuff. He likes to kill people. He's killed five so far, I want him. Yeah, I'm sure you do. But how are you going to get him? We've got his girlfriend. Whoop-dee-do! You think this guy's interested in a piece of ass? - She's all we've got. - And she leads nowhere. I want you to talk to one of our psychics. Oh, chief. Linda's in the building working on that missing kid case. I'm gonna send her up here to give you a reading. - Come on, chief. - Just do it, Ramsay. [ominous music] Hmm. Louis. Lou. Lou. An old name. Lucifer. - Luther? - Yeah. - Is his name Luther? - Yeah. And you're looking for him. He's very angry. Where is he? I'm not surprised you're looking for him. You have a karmic bond, you know. You were brothers in another lifetime. - Linda... - Your relationship is very clear. You're like pieces in the same puzzle. You've been close many times, and you'll get closer. - Linda... - You'll definitely meet. When and where? He'll see to that. After all, you have what he wants. [ominous music] I do? Of course. Well, yes, I work as an exercise instructor. Where? Well, a lot of places. Look, I've got a firm body, man. My body's perfect. Here, just go ahead and touch that, it's like a rock. I can see that. Oh, come on, buddy. Ramsay, listen, this guy's giving me a hard time. He doesn't believe I'm an exercise instructor. - I can't help you, kid. [Woman] Wiener-head! [Man On Intercom] Officer Milhop, artist sketch room. - Called you back too, huh? - Yeah. - How are you feeling? - Okay. Hurts a little, but it's okay. - Hey, Ramsay, telephone. - I'm not here. - What's going on? - Jack. You know those illegal chips, it looks like they were production-etched. Meaning what? They were run off a regular assembly line. So? So, somewhere there are photo templates to make more. [Jack] Who has the templates? I don't know, but we better find them. Hey, Ramsay, he said he knows you're here. Do you know somebody named Luther? [dramatic music] This is Ramsay. [Luther] You're lucky to be alive, Ramsay. You should've let the robot disarm it. So you watch television. What's on your mind? [Luther] I watch, I look, I listen. I'm watching you now. Yeah, right. What's on your mind, Luther? [Luther] You're standing by the desk in the middle of the room, punching buttons on the console, trying to trace this call, which won't do shit, because I'm calling from a mobile phone. Now you're looking around. Now you're cupping your hand over the receiver. He's tapped into the closed-circuit TV. Kill that monitor! [Luther] I can't hear what you're saying now, but you're right. I've tapped into the TV line. That wasn't very nice, Ramsay. How'd he do that? [Luther] You're probably wondering how I did that. [laughs] What do you want? [Luther] I want my girl, Ramsay. I know she's there. I want you to turn her over to me. No way. [Luther] If you don't, I'll kill her. And then I'll kill you. You can't run away, Ramsay. I'll find you. My little machines will find you wherever you go. [dial done beeps] Dammit! Why's he want the girl so much? Maybe she has the templates. Coming in, Nick. Marvin, can you get me a little bug? A real little one? [Marvin] Yeah, I got it for you. [Officer] All right, will do. You were supposed to catch him. And how are you tonight? I said, you were supposed to catch him! I tried. Yeah, well you didn't, shithead! I feel bad about it too. Well not half as bad as I do. You know, you really screwed up. You let him get away. You know where that leaves me? He's smart, you know? He's gonna know how you got into that hotel room, and how you find him because I told. And he's gonna be so mad! What am I gonna do now? Well we'll take care of you, Jackie. Yeah, sure you will. We're gonna move you to a safe place. You're move me to a safe place? And where is that? There is no safe place. Not from him. [Jack] Sure there is. No, there isn't! What does it take to get through to you?! He sees everything. He knows everything that's going on in here. Do you understand what I'm saying to you? Why is he looking for you, Jackie? How do I know? We better move you. [Machine] Beginning debug scan. [machine whirring] Scan complete. No bugs detected. Beginning debug scan. [machine whirring] Scan complete. No bugs detected. Purse, Jackie. [Jackie] Not again. - Come on. - I'm clean. We'll see. [Machine] Beginning debug scan. [machine whirring] Bug detected. [Karen] Give me your blouse, Jackie. Nice. [Machine] Resuming scan. [machine whirring] Bug detected. [Karen] Give me your bra. [Machine] Resuming scan. [machine whirring] Bug detected. [Karen] Hold still. [Machine] Resuming scan. [machine whirring] Bug detected. Got a lot of bugs, Jackie. I thought I was clean. You're loaded. Luther really wants to keep track of you. Why is that, Jackie? [scanner beeping] - These two are clean. - Okay, fine. Are you crazy? These are police cars. You want the regular four-car escort? Nope, just you. We'll take this one with the robot driver. You ride shotgun. Is that gonna be enough? Hell, no! If we go out there in cop cars, they'll catch on to us right away. Oh, I doubt that. You doubt that? You are acting like freaking Sir Galahad riding on your white horse, and you're gonna get us all killed. Where's the templates, Jackie? What templates? Let's get moving, come on. Great, we hit the streets and you, me and dollface are dead. Hey, Jack, you need a hand? Everything's fine, just don't touch the cars, Rudy. Oh, hey, come on, it's me, Rudy, your buddy. Don't touch the car! - Hey, come on, I'm clean. - Back off! Okay. [engines starting] [dramatic music] [helicopter whirring] [Jackie] It's Luther. Yeah, could be. [tires screeching] - Thompson, you reading? - Very clear. - Armed? - Yeah. What do you think our chances are of getting through this? I'm not worried. Yeah, well, you should be. [keyboard clattering] [Computer] Internal screens are activated. Clear so far. [Computer] No electronic targets are shown. [dramatic music] Set up. Okay, pull back a little. Get the lock-on ready. [robot beeping] [alarm blaring] - A Lock-on is armed. - Lock-on, armed. - Front or rear? - Rear. [robot whirring and beeping] [Computer] A lock-on is tracking. Shit! In progress. [robot whirring and beeping] You're riding shotgun, kid, it's all yours. - Got it. - A lock-on is targeted. [robot beeping and whirring] [laser zapping] [robot explodes] - One down. - Lock-on tracking. One coming. [robot beeping and whirring] [Computer] A lock-on is closing. - From the front. - 200 yards. [robot beeping and whirring] - [laser zapping] - [robot explodes] You are crazy, you're both crazy! [robot beeping and whirring] [Computer] A lock-on is tracking. Conditions are serious. [robot beeping and whirring] - [laser zapping] - [robot explodes] [robots beeping and whirring] Damn, what are they keyed on, how many you got? Five, six. - Bail out. - Moving in. [Computer] Conditions are dangerous. - What's happening now? - We're getting out of here. [Computer] Multiple lock-ens targeted at less than 200 yards. Conditions are dangerous. [robots beeping and whirring] Multiple lock-ons targeted at less than 100 yards. - Come on, jump! - Conditions are dangerous. [robots beeping and whirring] Multiple lock-ons targeted at less than 50 yards. Conditions dangerous. Multiple lock-ons are closing. Conditions dangerous. Conditions dangerous. [gasps] Take evasive action. [robots beeping and whirring] [robot explodes] [tires screeching] [car explodes] [robot beeping and whirring] Multiple lock-ons are closing. - They're still tracking! - Multiple lock-ons targeted. Damn, what are they keyed on? Whatever it is, it moved over when you did. - Conditions are dangerous. - Jackie. Come on, you know I'm clean. Six coming front and rear. [Computer] Targeted at less than 200 yards. - We're never gonna make it. - Conditions are dangerous. [Jack] Jackie! [Computer] Multiple lock-ons targeted at less than 100 yards. - [alarm beeping] All right, all right, just a minute! [Computer] 80, 70, 60, 50, 40, 30. Go ahead, throw it! [Computer] Conditions are hopeless. - Conditions are hopeless. - [robot explodes] [tires screeching] That did it. The templates? Do you have any idea how much these are worth? I know Luther wants 'em pretty bad. - Yeah, he does. - And I want Luther pretty bad. What do you say we make a public appearance? [Automated Voice] Hi, you want sushi? - Two California rolls. - Hi. [Jackie] You know, you gotta be out of your mind to stand here like this. - Why, where is he? - How the hell should I know? He could be anywhere. Yeah, well, that doesn't do us much good, does it? This is the stupidest thing I've ever heard of. You think he's gonna show up here? He's not gonna show up, so let's just get out of here. He wants these doesn't he? He'll come. [Automated Voice] Hi, sushi is here. Oh, see, doesn't that look good? You had the tekka maki. [Luther] Ramsay. [dramatic music] Let me speak to her, Ramsay. - Where are you? - Don't be an asshole. I'm like you, having dinner. You might say, a night out on the town with your partner. Come on, come on, hurry up. Officer Thompson here was nice enough to lend me her headset. Move a little, dear, so he can see the gun. Take a seat with Jackie. [Jack] Come on. [suspenseful music] [Waiter] Good evening, two for dinner? - That's right. - This way, please. [customers chattering] [Luther] Be cool. We don't want any shooting in a place like this, do we? No. [Luther] Good boy. Just don't get too nervous, Ramsay. I won't. I beg your pardon, sir? Nothing, this is fine. [Luther] All right, now give Jackie the templates. [dramatic music] Good evening, would you like something from the bar? No, nothing, thank you. I'll be right back with your menus, okay? Could you give us a couple minutes? Sure. [Luther] All right, now send Jackie over to me. You send Thompson first. [Luther] What's the matter, Sergeant? Don't you trust me? Come on, come on, I haven't got all night. It's my insurance policy. [dramatic music] - Send Thompson. - At the same time. Go ahead, Jackie. [dramatic music] [customers chattering] [blade clicks] [Jackie gasps] [Luther] Goodbye, darling. Sweet dreams. What do you think I'm stupid, Ramsay? What's the matter, is something wrong? These aren't all of 'em, Ramsay. Nobody does that to me, nobody! [gun fires] [bullet whirring] [bullet explodes] [gun fires] [bullet whirring] [bullet explodes] [dramatic music] [breathing heavily] - So he got away. - Yeah. And he stiffed the girl. - That's right. - Well, that's good. That's excellent work, Ramsay. What are you gonna do next? Nothing. Well you can't screw that up. I'm gonna do nothing 'cause I planted a bug on him. We'll pick it up anytime now. You hope. [knocking on door] What is it? Ramsay, they got a signal from the bug on Luther. - Where? - City Hospital, he must have got hurt. [thunder rumbling] Hey, have you got enough people here? I gotta pick you up. - Where is he? - He's in the john. We're ready to go in. Clear those civilians outta here, let's go. You stay here. [lightning striking] [Officer] Where the hell did he go? Sally! [lightning striking] [sensor beeping] Congratulations, you guys. You just staked out a roll of toilet paper. Sally, go through the usual routines. Maybe we can find something. We'd better go. You wanna watch the door in case someone comes in? [Officer] Sure. [lightning striking] [robot whirring] [lightning striking] [dramatic music] [robot whirring] [screams] [robot explodes] [Man On Intercom] Tickets for the 5th Annual Precinct Costume Ball go on sale this Friday. Please see Officer Frye for more info. [dramatic music] [officers chattering] Where's the chief? Hey, chief. I don't know where you got those idiots for the stakeout. - Okay, Ramsay. But it was really amateur night. - Okay, Ramsay, we blew it. - Come on. Yeah, I'll say you blew it. - We should have had him. - Yeah, keep me informed. You didn't find him, huh? Nope. He's good. [Karen] Jack, you better look at this. [dramatic music] Oh, God. [dial pad clattering] [busy tone beeping] It's busy. [dramatic music] Bobby! Bobby! [lightning striking] - Lois? - Here. Here. Here. - Here. - Lois, what happened? [Lois] Here. Here. [Karen] Her voice module's broken. See if you can patch it. How could she let this happen, wasn't she watching the door? - Don't try to speak, Lois. - [Lois whirring] She's losing a lot of hydraulic fluid. She'll be all right as long as she keeps power to her memory circuits. [Lois] Bob, Bobby. Bobby. Hit the reset. Lois? [Lois] Bobby was on the phone when an extremely unpleasant man came in the back door. What about Bobby? [Lois] The man forced Bobby to leave with him. - How long ago? - My clock is disconnected. I do not know the elapsed time. Did he say anything? Where he was going, anything? [Lois] He left no, no. - Lois? - [Lois whirring] Let me see that. I'm really sorry, Jack. [Lois] I am really sorry, but dinner will not be painted in time. Sergeant Ramsay's not here to answer your call. - I can't get it patched. - Please leave your message when you hear the tone. May I show you to the door? - May I show you to the door? - I think that's it. - May I show you... - Lois, do an internal diagnostic check. [Lois] Beginning diagnostic check now. [beeping] [phone rings] What'd you do with my son? [Luther] Listen, sucker. Yeah, I'm listening. [Luther] If you wanna see your boy alive, bring the other templates. Just you alone. No tricks this time. [Jack] Where? Yeah, I'll be there. - Where we going? - Alone, he said alone. - I'm your partner. - He said alone. He'll know if you come. I'll wait out in the car. Listen to me, he'll know. I'm not taking any chances with Bobby. Well where are you gonna meet him? You promise me you won't follow me? I promise. - And you won't call anybody? - I won't call anybody. [Lois] Diagnostic check completed. There is a malfunction. - Lois? - Please check battery connection. - Sure. [Lois] Thank you. [Lois whirring] - Is this it? - Yes. [beeping] [Jack] What'd you do with my son? [Luther] Listen, sucker. [Jack] Yeah, I'm listening. [Luther] If you wanna see your boy alive, bring the other templates. Just you alone. No tricks this time. - Where? - [robot explodes] Where? [Luther] Go down Main Street to right to Sentises Construction site. [dramatic music] [robots pattering] Don't worry, Ramsay, the spiders won't hurt you! [Bobby] Dad, are you coming to get me? Better have the templates this time, Ramsay. I do. [Luther] All right, drop your gun. Now get on the elevator! [dramatic music] [elevator clattering] Come out, Ramsay! [machinery whirring] - [sparks zapping] Let him go. Now! Of course. Get on the elevator, Bobby. I wanna stay with you, Dad. [Jack] Get on the elevator, son. Push the button to go down. Stay away from the edge! The templates, Ramsay! After he's down. After he's safe. There's a little problem about that, Sergeant. - I can't have any witnesses. - [dramatic music] It's too messy. The spiders have been programmed to kill the first person that comes out of the elevator. Oh, they'll let you in, but they won't let you out. And there's nothing you can do about it, - Bobby! - Sergeant! Stop the elevator! Push the button! - What's the matter? - Stop the elevator! Push the button! They don't work! None of them work! [Luther] You can't stop it, Ramsay. I fixed the elevator. Look on your monitor. You may get a better view. Dad? [grunts] Bobby! [dramatic music] Bobby! Ever see 'em kill somebody, Ramsay? - It's really impressive. - [robots pattering] They're loaded with acid. Bobby! [robots pattering] Dad! [dramatic music] Karen! [Karen] Come on, kid. [robots pattering] You bastard! [gun fires] [bullet explodes] [gun fires] [bullet whirring] [bullet explodes] [gun fires] [steam hissing] [bullet explodes] [elevator clattering] [wind whistling] [dramatic music] [gasps] [button clacks] [robots pattering] [gasps] [robot explodes] [robots pattering] [robot explodes] [dramatic music] - [robot whirring] - [Ramsay screams] [dramatic music] [gasping] [sparks zapping] [suspenseful music] [grunts] [robot pattering] [spark zaps] [robot explodes] [alarm beeping] [elevator clattering] [groans] [groans] [latch bangs] - [bones cracking] - [Ramsay groans] That's good, Ramsay. But not good enough. Enjoy the view? - [elevator clattering] - [Luther grunting] [Luther screams] - [robots pattering] - [dramatic music] [gasping] [screaming] [elevator clattering] Dad! It's okay, son. [bright music] It's okay. Thanks. You all right? Yeah, I'm okay. [elevator clattering] Bobby, you go to the car. Tell Lois you're all right. [screams] [dramatic music] [robots exploding] [Karen] You look awful. I think I've overcome my fear of heights. Hurt much? No, it's all right, I'll get it taken care of. How about dinner? Dinner? [Karen] Sure. Just 'cause you're a woman shouldn't make any difference, right? Yeah. Can you cook? Try me. [bright music]
