TOEI COMPANY, LTD. Presents Based on the novel, "Hold Me and Kiss Me" written by IEDA Shoko MINAMOTO Yoko AKAI Hidekazu MINAMI Kaho MIURA Tomokazu Directed by: SATO Junya Yes? Yes! Keiko, it's for you. Hello, may I help you? Yes, this is Aida. Oh, Mr. Tanabe! Oh, yes! Long time no talk! What's the occasion? Good work. See you tomorrow. By any chance, are you going out on a date? No, that's not it! Just seeing my ex-boyfriend! Isn't that a date? I haven't seen him in three years already, you know! Mr. Tanabe? Oh, long time no see! I got married. Two years ago. You lost weight, didn't you? Yes. So, nothing's wrong with you? What do you mean? I have no idea howl got... I only dated two girls before you... And, after we broke up, I got married... That's all I know. I haven't fooled around. What are you talking about? I took a test. It was positive. I have AIDS. I thought it'd be wrong to not say anything. What if something should happen to you... Are you saying you got it from me? Well... Yours may be negative. Anyway, you'd better take a test. If you're scared, I'll go with you, so... KISS ME AND HOLD ME The AIDS virus, which enters and infects one's bloodstream, targets a T4 lymph cell, which governs one's immune system. Targets a T4 lymph cell, which governs one's immune system. T4 Lymph Cell When the virus invades a T4 lymph cell, it creates its own DNA. And, it sends the DNA into the lymph cell's nucleus and ends up inserting it into the lymph cell's DNA. As a result, the T4 lymph cell ends up not recognizing the AIDS virus as an invader and does not activate its the AIDS virus as an invader and does not activate its T4 Lymph Cell Invaded by AIDS Virus immune system against the AIDS virus. T4 Lymph Cell Invaded by AIDS Virus immune system against the AIDS virus. The AIDS virus repeats this and multiplies. Alter destroying the lymph cell, it attacks a new one. And eventually, the body's immune system weakens. AIDS Virus Even with modem medicine it's impossible to completely Even with modem medicine it's impossible to completely Destroyed T4 Lymph Cell cure the AIDS virus once it has invaded a lymph cell. Destroyed T4 Lymph Cell I'm a 38-year old hemophiliac. As you know, hemophilia is a disease in which one's blood won't stop coming out once one starts bleeding. I'd been in and out of hospitals since I was little. I couldn't attend school regularly. I was ostracized by people and... Those were uneasy days, being constantly in fear of the possibility of internal bleeding. What brought a bright ray of hope to hemophiliacs like me was the development of blood products. "We don't have to depend on blood transfusions." "We can inject shots by ourselves." "The medicine of our dreams was developed!" I shared the joy with my friends. But, I got the AIDS virus through those blood products. "If I had to die, I'd rather die of cancer..." I sometimes used to think that. If it was cancer, I wouldn't infect other people. People would sympathize, and I won't be hated, or scare people. But, when I say I'm an AIDS patient... Are you Ms. Tsushima? Yes. I'm the representative of the AIDS Support Group of Kabayama. Thank you very much for your precious story. Now, we'll ask the next speaker to come forward. Currently, infection from blood products is being prevented. But, about 1,600 AIDS patients are suffering from that. Are there any AIDS patients besides hemophiliacs in this meeting? No, not yet. It's hard to tell other people when they were infected by intercourse or drugs, I guess. Have a seat, please Are they afraid of prejudice or discrimination? Yes, prejudice and discrimination make AIDS patients stay in hiding, and raise the risk of AIDS' prevalence. If we exclude hemophilic AIDS patients... Before 1990... The percentage of infections by heterosexual intercourse, homosexual intercourse, and by hypodennic needles is one-third each. That's right. But in 1992, the amount of AIDS patients infected by heterosexual intercourse surpassed eighty percent. Eighty percent? Yes. That is... Not only among the minority groups, such as homosexuals and habitual drug users... But also among ordinary heterosexual relationships, the AIDS virus started to spread. But, if we're not promiscuous overseas, or patronize foreign prostitutes in Japan... Indeed, most of female AIDS patients are foreigners, but... A Japanese man who gets infected from those women can unknowingly infect a Japanese woman... In addition, Japanese women can infect another man. Such secondary and tertiary infection cases have been increasing. In foreign statistics, since the point where the number of AIDS patients infected through heterosexual intercourse surpassed 50%, the overall number of AIDS patients has been drastically increasing. Even in Japan, the possibility of infection is very high. Blood, which is collected in hospitals and clinics, comes here first and is sent out for an antibody test. Donated blood comes here, too? No, it goes to the blood center. Please make sure to write that in your article, OK? There are many people who say they're not infected because they donated blood, you know! They use blood donation in a HIV test. Aren't we supposed to? No, even if donated blood is HIV positive, we do not contact the donor. The purpose is different, so... A patient's serum is tested with a source of light. If an HIV antigen is present, when we see it through a fluorescent-light microscope, it shines and looks greenish. That means it's HIV positive. The yellow ones are HIV positive. And, what's seen as pinkish and spread out is HIV positive, too. When you think about it, it's scary, isn't it? Not all of the people who are HIV positive know that they're infected, so... So, there's a risk of them infecting other people without their knowing? That's right. But, we can't force all of them to take a test, either. Did you take a test? Yes, just in case... And? I'm waiting for the results. Excuse me. Is this where I can get my results? Yes, please have a seat over there and wait. Number 548, please come in. How was it? I'm alright. Really? Are you sure? If you say so, ask the doctor then! Number 547, please come in. I'm sorry. Come with me! Number 550, please come in. Please come inside, Madam. Number 552, please come in. Good news! You're HIV negative. Thank you. But, this only proves that you weren't infected up to 3 months prior. If there was a chance of infection in the last 3 months, we cannot get a positive reaction in this test. Unfortunately, there's no chance of that. Number 554! Here. Please come in. Excuse me, Miss. My name is Tsushima. I've been doing some interviews. How can I help? I came to take test, too. I was HIV negative. What does that have to do with me? That was my first encounter with Aida Keiko. The HIV virus is also present in tears or saliva. But, it's an extremely small amount. So, there's no risk of infection. And naturally, it's not contagious. There's no chance of infection from contact in everyday life. Infection can only be transmitted through blood, semen, or female vaginal secretions. So, during sex, the male must absolutely wear a condom. Using a condom can prevent you from infecting or being infected by someone. Hello? Is this the Aida residence? Yes, this is. Hey! What in the world are you doing! This is Tanabe's wife. I heard about it from my husband... Hello, Ms. Aida? You took a test, right? What was the result? It was positive. You gave it to my husband after all, didn't you? How many men on earth did you sleep with? My baby is an AIDS patient, you know? Can you hear me? My baby is going to die, you know! I'll tell everybody! I'll tell everyone in your company that you have AIDS! Stupid! That's enough! Cut it out! Shigeru... Is that you? Did you give it to me? Why don't you hang out with us? Say! Hey! Pull yourself together! I'm fine. I'm alright. You forced yourself to drink too much, because you didn't have to pay... If you can't hold your liquor, don't drink at all! You've been drinking like this almost everyday recently, haven't you? Oh boy! What's the matter? What's with her? I was nice enough to ask if she's OK... Are you really alright? That's not good. You're bleeding! I'm fine. My blister popped. That's all. Ouch... This is no good. I'll walk you home. Where do you live? I'll be leaving. Could you pass me a towel? I'm going to take a shower, then. No! I'm sorry... What are you talking about? No. Please don't! I beg of you! I'm really sorry. I could've gone home if you had said so. It can't be helped. I'll sleep on this other bed. Even if I go home from now, I'll have to go to work soon, so... Do you mind if I smoke? I work at a securities firm, but... I'm treated like a criminal no matter where I go and... I'm a man, but even so, I miss people. I didn't mean to hurt your feelings. I know. You were just lonely, right? "Thank you for your gentle heart." Good morning. I'll tell everyone at your company that you have AIDS! What's wrong? Haven't you woken up from your dream last night yet? I don't want to wake up from that... Thank you very much. You're really cold, aren't you? When I woke up this morning, I realized I was on a park bench. My clothes were muddy. One of my shoes was gone. Until I reached home, I kept having cold sweats, you know! I stayed overnight at a police station because of you. Huh? Don't lie! It's true. What did I do? Tell me what I did! Didn't you remember anything about last night? What did I do? Tell me what I did! Hey! It's not a big deal. If so, tell me! Don't worry. It's not a big deal. Hey! Tell me! Hello? This is Takano. Six out of the 20 hostesses were HIV positive. But, they didn't come to receive their test results, we contacted their workplace. And, we were told that all of the infected hostesses were missing. Do you think they're hiding, to continue working? Well... I don't know. I can't even guess. But, the bar's owner has been showing his customers the consultation tickets that the hostesses got for their examinations. And, he's been lying to his customers, telling them that because his hostesses took AIDS tests, his bar is safe. Are there any customers who are HIV positive? Yes. Only four of the customers came to take a test, but all of them were found HIV positive. Hello. How are you today? Yes. Yes, I got it. Call me later then. Tsushima! We got a patient who doesn't mind being interviewed! He's the patient of the Takigawa Municipal Hospital. When did you get an appointment? 3 o'clock this afternoon! I'll be going! Thanks! Sure! What kind of person is the patient? He was in the same line of work as me. The infected patients ward... He used to be a doctor, but he got infected while treating his patients. For now, I have no choice but to stall the HIV virus in my body somehow, and deal with them for as long as I can. I bet the viruses want to live a long time too, so... For HIV, we can check if we're infected or not even though we don't actually have full blown AIDS. So currently, researchers are researching how they can delay the onset of full blown AIDS after someone is infected. And, they have data that shows a patient's mental stability delays the onset of full blown AIDS. I wanted to tell you about that. Not to discriminate or avoid HIV infected people... That's one of the important ways to decrease the tragedy of developing full blown AIDS. I see. When I make this story into an article, do you mind if I reveal your name and your photo? Why not? You won't be infected even if you drink with this cup. Even if you know that, you're scared after all, right? I'm scared of prejudice and discrimination, too. That baby, too? Yes, it was transmitted from mother to infant. In the case of children, they develop full-blown AIDS faster. You don't need to let it bother you. Yes? I'm scared, too. Even if I see patients every day... I'll be leaving now! Bye-bye! Hello? This is Cosmo Travel. Does your leg still hurt? Yes, a little bit. This is your money. Never mind about that. Then, I'll treat you dinner with this money! I haven't changed clothes since yesterday, so... Why don't you go home and change, then? Let's go! Wait! Wait one second. I'll put them away right now. Have a seat. Can I have a glass of water? Sure. Is water OK? Yes. Here you go. Thank you. I'll change my clothes right away. This place is OK with you, right? Yes, but, are you sure... Well, it's your money, right? I don't think it's enough. Let's go Dutch then! What are you doing on your next days off? I'm going to go back 10 my parents' house in Tochigi. What? You're still not very independent yet, are you? Yes. I keep on making my parents worry... That's not good! You should be making a man worry instead of your parents! You're about that age already, you know. You're right. If you feel like making a man worry or your days off... OK? Thank you very much for today. I had fun. Good night, then. Why are you being so stubborn? I can see that lonely look on your face, you know. I've been thinking about you all day long today, and I couldn't concentrate on my work, you know. Please don't. Please go home. I'm sorry for visiting you all of a sudden. I'm Shigeru's friend from college. My name is Aida Keiko. Shigeru isn't here. He's gone on a trip abroad. When is he coming back? I don't know about that for sure. I terribly sorry... After you came all the way here. Thank you very much for coming though. Is Shigeru sick? What are you saying? Who told you such an irresponsible rumor? I have the same disease as him. The AIDS virus went into his brain and... Well, he had an accident during a trip abroad during his high school years. He had a blood transfixion way back then, but this horrible thing happened... Shigeru isn't a bad person. It's not his fault. Is there somebody! See! Shigeru, it's God, you know! Look! Shigeru. Help me! Help! You should be alright. Help me! Hey! God! You'll be fine. Help me! Oh, Kei-chan. Did you come back to see your parents? I'm sure your parents will be happy! They always talk about you, so... What? Let's eat! How is it? It's good. It's delicious! I'm glad to hear that. I wanted to stay over tonight, too, but... What? Are you going home? Because I don't have a dress to wear for work tomorrow... I see. Why don't you come over to stay at my house then? Am I that handsome? Yes, you are. Good morning. "Regarding your Fall Medical Checkup... "From this time, we'll have a blood test and "a urinalysis and have a more detailed checkup." Say! There's a rumor this blood test is actually an HIV test, you know. Many of our employees frequent unsavory places, so... Next Tuesday... You're good at cooking, aren't you, Misses? She's not my wife yet, you know. Silly! Say, Misses... It's heartbreaking to serve a man who doesn't understand a woman's heart like this, right? Mr. Kobayashi, you seem like an expert who knows a woman's heart, don't you? Well. Not really though. Don't act big! Despite the fact that you aren't popular with the ladies at all! You just don't know about that! The other day, I was... Oh, Misses. Have a seat here. Drink with us! I'm making one more dish, so... You really landed a good one, you know! Even so, you shouldn't work until you get dark circles under your eyes, you know! Really? You're really honest, aren't you? You'll be talked about after the physical checkup the day after tomorrow, you know. They'll say you have the 'Oversexed Syndrome.' Silly! There's no such thing! It's better than being told, "You're HIV positive," though! I'm sorry. About what? Because I brought home such a silly guy without warning... He kept asking me to introduce you to him and didn't back down. Please don't let it bother you. But... What? I want to be only with you, for a while. I don't want to be bothered by anybody. Is that a woman's kind of love? Yes, it is. Unless you're injured while you're cooking and the blood goes into food, there's no chance of infection, you know. Really? Anyway, are there any symptoms, such as constant diarrhea, a mild but continuing fever, or night sweats? Not at all. So, Doctor... Isn't there any chance that the test results were wrong? I feel really healthy, you know. We conduct our tests very carefully and cautiously. When will I develop full blown AIDS? If we check the number of T4 lymph cells in your blood, we can guess that to some extent. So, please take the test. I will. And... If I have sex, will my partner be automatically infected? The possibility isn't that high, we hear. But, there are cases of female to male HIV transmission from just one sexual contact. So, we can't count on numbers. I'm son-y! I'm terribly sorry! That's alright. Leave me alone. "I deeply appreciate the kindness you showed him before "his death. And, I deeply pray for your good health. "Sincerely yours, Sasaki Yoshiko." What? Are you crying? WhY are you sad? No, I'm happy- Is that a woman's love again? I don't get it though... What? What is this smell? It's gas! Keiko, the gas is leaking! Wait! There's no time for that! Did you do that? Why are you doing such a stupid thing? What's going on? I won't understand you if you don't say anything, right? Why did you try to kill me? Why don't you say something! If you don't say anything, I'll leave, you know. I see. I don't want to be killed without knowing why. Are you sure? I'm really leaving, you know. I... I'm HIV positive. I may have given it to you... Since when? Since when have you been HIV positive? On the first day I met you was notified. It's not something that I can just apologize for, and be forgiven, but... We can't change anything now already! Excuse me. I'd like to see Ms. Aida Keiko, but... One moment, please. It's rude to ask, but what is your relationship with her? Is anything wrong with Ms. Aida? Well... I'm her acquaintance. Ms. Aida resigned. When was that? I heard that we received her letter of resignation yesterday. What was her reason? It just said, "For personal reasons"... Don't you know anything about it? No, I don't. Thank you. Is that true that Ms. Aida has AIDS? Stop saying such an irresponsible thing! Is it true? Is it possible? Actually, it takes a few months for an HIV antigen to form. So, we can't get a dependable result unless it's been at least 3 months from the last time you two had intercourse. But, if you're wonted, why don't you take a test anyway. And then, in a few months, you can take another one... Hello? I wonder if I can stay sane without going crazy for a few months... Excuse... me... Ms. Aida. I'm coming in. Ms. Aida? Ms. Aida! Akira? Do you feel sick? This isn't good for you! You need to let fresh air in! Why did you come here? I picked up your medical card from the hospital the other day. I went to your company to return it to you, but I heard that you suddenly resigned. And thought something must've happened to you, so I came to visit. What does it have lo do with you? If I was wrong, I'll apologize to death, but... You've contacted the AIDS virus, haven't you? What on earth does that have to do with you? While researching about AIDS, I found out that it's a very scary disease not only for the human body but also for the human mind. I can learn about AIDS if I ask doctors and researchers. But, I thought I have no choice but to ask AIDS patients about their mental anguish. About their anxiety toward this new virus... About what they think about love and the future of their marriages... And, about their social lives... Being surrounded by discrimination: and prejudice... That speech might've made you thirsty, right? Have some drink. Can I have one cube of ice? Didn't you learn that you can't get infected by anything but blood, semen, and vaginal secretions? Stop it! If you're that scared, you shouldn't have come here, should you? Oh no! I'll be leaving for today. I heard Mr. Kubojima actually committed suicide. Committed suicide? Why? Apparently, he had full blown AIDS. I thought that only bad people who play around get infected by HIV, as punishment from God, but... If I think about a serious man like Mr. Kubojima being an AIDS patient, I can't think of it as somebody else's business. How did Mr. Kubojima get HIV? I haven't heard about that, but... I bet that beautiful widow got infected, too. Stop being so insensitive! Think about AIDS patients' suffering! Hello! I came to see you again. This is ice cream. Let's eat it together later! Is today your cleaning day? I'll help you! Say... Stay and have dinner with me, OK? I have an appointment today. A date, huh? Unfortunately, I don't have a boyfriend right now. You have some work to do, then. Yes. Liar! Actually, you're afraid to eat what I cook, right? That's not true. Then what? Tell me! Leave already! You just come here to write an article by using me as research material, and to make money after all, don't you? That's not true! Then what? Is it out of sympathy for me? Curiosity? Get out already! I don't ever want to see you again! I'd be honored to eat the dinner you cook for me. Let's finish up cleaning and go grocery shopping! OK? If we take too long, it'll be dark soon, you know! What's really scary is prejudice and discrimination. Let's live alongside AIDS patients! We can get the results in two weeks. We don't allow telephone inquiries. So, please come to get the results in person. I was so happy. To be held by a man... I didn't know how safe I could feel... The sense of loneliness that was going through my head, and was driving me crazy at the time, melted away like snow... Did you tell the man, Akira, about your disease? I'm sure Akira knew it. I didn't say anything to him, but... He knew it and held me, I'm sure! Because I can't say... Because I couldn't possibly say that I'm lonely, you know! I don't know how many times I tried to tell him about it... But... You talk big, but you don't know anything, do you? But, because you love him, you wanted to infect him, too. That's too cruel! A man who lived with me... Despite that I'm HIV positive, he isn't infected, and he's leaving with a pure body... I can't take it. You can't understand! About how a person who is HIV positive and a person who's not are totally different, like a demon and an angel! We aren't the same human beings! Did you come to see me because she asked you? No, I came to see you by my own decision. Keiko quit her job. Did they find out that she's HIV positive? No, on the day before the company's medical checkup... I haven't found out I'm HIV positive yet! I bet you're holding a grudge against her. Don't talk nonsense! If I tell you this, you may get even more mad, but... Did you think about why she did a thing like that? Keiko said it's because she loved you. If she loves me, how could she give me the HIV Virus! That's what I can't take! Didn't you love her? Keiko is Keiko even if she's HIV positive or not, right? I'll tell you one thing. I'm going down the same path that Keiko suffered through! Tell Keiko that. Number 3 passed the first gate! Where were you looking? How can the ball move without you touching it! They're always like that. I hate it. We won't live that long anyway, so I don't think it matters who wins or loses, though. That's how it goes, huh? Human beings are... Cheer up! Women who sit on this bench this early in the morning were ether deceived or dumped by a man, so... That stupid guy! Get yourself together! Why don't you try playing some Japanese croquet? Hitting the ball fiercely refreshes you, you know! Even I can do it, so you should be fine! Hold the stick like this and... I'm an AIDS patient. AIDS? You may get infected, you know! If you're infected, you could die, you know. Who cares? If you want to, give it to me. I'm neither scared of AIDS nor fox-spirits! If you don't mind it being an old hag like me, give it to me! I don't know what kind of thing AIDS is, but... If you give it to me and you'll be cured, give it to me. OK? If it'll make you feel better by doing so, don't hesitate! The only thing that's scary at my age is living long. What's so fun? All we have is Japanese croquet... Don't die, OK? Please don't die! Kimi-chan, why did you pass away? Why... Oh my... This old lady acting senile again, huh? Apparently, when she sees a young woman like you, she remembers her late daughter. Let's go, Miyo-chan. It's your tum, you know. Sure. Here you go! This is what you asked me for. Thank you! I hope you didn't go out of your way! It's so rare to find a person who wants to proofread! You're a rare commodity! The Editor-in-Chief was so happy, you know. Say, when is the due date? I'll make it on time for sure! There's no need to get so excited. Say, Why don't we go Shopping today? I'll treat you to dinner. Really? Oh, I'm sorry- Let's go! The door is closing. Please be careful. Are you alright, Keiko? Thank you very much. Yes. OK. Which hospital are you going to? It's the Hachimandai Emergency Hospital. Could you go to the Takigawa Hospital? You can't just choose the hospital. It's the head office's decision, so... This person is HIV positive. Do you remember if the Hachimandai Hospital accepts AIDS patients? I wonder... The Hachimandai Hospital doesn't accept AIDS patients. Please contact the head office! The Takigawa Hospital is our only choice, isn't it? Yes, I got it. Aida... I'm looking for Aida! I heard that Aida Keiko was rushed here! Ms. Aida, right? We'll check, so please hold on a second. Oh, Ms. Aida Keiko was admitted to the emergency ward at 3:20 PM. And right now, we can't allow any visitors to see her. Is she that bad? In this section, we can't tell what the patient's condition is. I'm her... She's an important person to me. Please tell me! Which room is she in? Mr. Takano. What happened? Is she alright? Her treatment has just finished and she's now sleeping in her hospital room. Has her HIV virus become full blown? She was about to have a miscarriage... But, she didn't. Then... She's 3 months pregnant. How do you feel? Did I give you the virus? Did I? I was HIV negative. I'm so glad! Thank you. But, I... Let's talk tomorrow. For tonight, you should sleep already. If you were HIV negative, why did you come back to see me? Which part of me did you fall in love with? Your silliness... Nope. The part of me that understands a woman's love, right? I wonder what other AIDS patients do about that... In cases where they are pregnant? Yes... I haven't seen anybody who was pregnant. But... Yes? Once we have contracted the HIV virus, it's iirreversible. So, in order to end the threat of AIDS, we need to avoid getting infected and infecting other people. Is it possible for a baby to contract it, too? It's believed that unbolrn babies have a 30% chance of contracting HIV through their placenta. How about the other 70%? If you should bear 10 children, the three of them will be infected and the seven of them won't be infected. That's just statistics. No one can say whether your unborn baby is either one of the three or one of the seven. Delivery is a heavy burden for an AIDS patient. In many cases, it hastens the development of full blown AIDS. Please think it over, and decide what to do between the two of you. What should we do? Stupid! I'm so stupid! What should I do? I'm going to have an abortion tomorrow morning. That's what he and I decided. Say": Yes? Even if you understand something through logic, your heart may not accept it. Have you ever thought that? Yes, I have. Many times. Me, too. But, I have to fight on my own. Right? How many men did you sleep with? Usually, parents wonder about what kind of clothes they should let their babies wear when they grow older, right? But, I have to worry about what kind of funeral I should have for my baby, you know! You gave this baby your virus! Stop crying! You'll die eventually, so I'd rather... Please don't! Stop bothering me! I'll kill you first then! Leave me alone! I have a baby in my stomach! You're killing your baby anyway, right? Please don't! No... Don't... Keiko! Keiko! It seems like you were having a nightmare. Were you? The baby in my stomach moves, you know. The baby isn't 3 months old yet though. But, I'm sure it's moving. This will be my last child. The first and the last... See, you can hear, right? What can you hear? The baby is talking to me, you know. "Hold me, and kiss me." Keiko, I told you, right? To fight against AIDS, there's nothing we can do but not infect and not be infected by somebody else. But, you held me even if I'm HIV positive, didn't you? My baby in my stomach is telling me... "Whether I'm HIV positive or not, hold me, and kiss me." I can hear it, too. The baby's voice, saying, "Hold me." There's a 70% chance that the baby won't be infected. Let's bet on the 70%, OK? If it should fall into the other 30%... Even so, I'll hold the baby. It's because it's my baby! But, I won't be able to live for so long... Nobody knows when their time will be up. One and a half year later... On that day, we went to find out Osamu's test results. Do you want to wait here? No, I'll go with you. It was exactly two years ago that we met here, wasn't it? It was long two years... and shot two years... We won! We beat AIDS, you know! Really? Come here, Osamu! Here you go! Here you go! Banzai! Six months later... It was a time when I could finally come to view my relationship with Keiko objectively and started writing the manuscript. Hello? Yes. I'll be right there! Keiko, Miyuki is here to see you, you know. I'm glad you could make it. I wanted to thank you no matter what, so... What are you saying? There's nothing to thank me for, you know. I was infected by HIV and seized a chance at true love. Thank you, Akira. Thank you, Miyuki. Sony for not being filial... I'm sorry. She breathed her last breath at 1:50 AM. This was my parting with Keiko... I can't really say if she won the tight against AIDS or not. But, I can clearly say that she tried to live with all her might. To live, she fought against the dreadful disease, AIDS, as well as people's prejudice and discrimination. And, the understanding and love of the people around her supported that fight. Specialists warn us that the number of HIV positive and AIDS patients will drastically increase in a few years. We have to face the dreadful disease, AIDS, now. And, I believe we have to start making an effort to overcome the incompatible fear toward AIDS and prejudice rooted in that disease. AIDS... That's what I'm wonted the most now. I don't have any friends who are HIV positive, so I don't know much about it. No one has AIDS at my workplace. Well, there may be some though.. It's somebody else's business, so I don't know. I think it's scary. My image of AIDS is that it's scary. To me, it means death. If human beings became extinct from that, I think it'd be pathetic. Taking the background of the times into consideration a bit more, we have to think about it more seriously. Because our children will grow older, I want to teach them accurate knowledge about it well. Even ordinary people should realize that it's everybody's problem.
