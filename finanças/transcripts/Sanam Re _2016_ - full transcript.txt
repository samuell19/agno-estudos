Always remember.. what Shakespeare said. Many fathers of success. "But the orphan is the failure. Pack your stuff..and get lost. Out! Finish that. Mr. Handu! Handu.. Who is Handu? - Come here. You called me Handu. I called you Handu. - You called me Handu! Relax. Tell me something. Were you born this way.. ...or did you hit your head when you were small. What? Shut up? How can any human being.. ...keep barking all day without a reason. L..l..l bark.. - No, no, no, don't get me wrong, sir. You don't bark.. you're are still barking. I am barking. - Yes. And in wrong English. - Wrong English? You trouble your staff all the time" ...in fact, even Shakespeare. - How you make fun of me.. No one respects you here, Handu. They are all scared. ...of their responsibilities towards their wife and child. Their car and home Eels. They scared of their daily life. But I am not scared. Not anymore. I will survive, Mr. Handu. I'll be very happy- Because I am not a slave of my dreams anymore. Mr. Handu.. - Don't call me Handu. You need us, as much as we need you. I found my truth. "But not you. Someone throw him out. Out. You make me work in this condition. You're inhuman. You idiot. - How dare you.. I am a idiot. I remember those days..what you made me go through. I am resigning. Me too. Even I am leaving with Akash. I am also resigning. Please, stop it. Don't go please, I'm sorry. Please forgive me I beg you, please stop. Always remember what Shakespeare said. To regret..do a little wrong. - What? No! No! No! Don't remember Shakespeare. I am sorry Akash. 'We can't give you anyone's address.' 'Sorry, sir.' 'Babaji rocks!' 'And it's possible that she might be married.' 'Or maybe she already has a boyfriend.' 'Akash, take my advice.' 'You're destined for someone else, not her.' 'It's been one full year.' 'And she didn't give you her number or address, or anything else.' Shruti. Taxi. Shruti! Shruti! Shruti! Do you want to die? Akash. Sit, sit..please. Will you please come to my cabin for a minute? Sure, sir. Someone's here to see you. The more I looked for love..the more I've been unsuccessful. I didn't want love from Pablo, only security. Today I am secure. "But the one I love.. "Doesn't love me. Anyways. . Remember, you said you don't do business with friends. Fine then, let me do business with your company. This way we can stay friends. I am starting a new company. ...and for that I need your company. What say? Are you crazy? It's the best offer, take it. If it was me, I would've readily accepted her offer. Married her and become her slave. And she's hot, man. Sexy, young, loaded and in love with you. What else do you want? Don't people buy used cars? Tell me. Look, this is the best chance for you. She's giving you a great offer..that too, in the US. It's been too long now, buddy. Be practical I've found Shruti's address The camp runs on my funding. Really? On the wet-drenched roads.. I wait for you. Slowly-gradually“ I surrender my heart to you. I want to lose myself.. and never be found. Slowly..l want to handover my life to you. "Sweetheart." "You're now my sweetheart" "Sweetheart." "You're now my sweetheart" "Your grace." "You showered me with your grace." "Sweetheart." "You're now my sweetheart" "As I get closer to you.." "..all my illusions are shattered." "Sweetheart." "You're now my sweetheart" "Sweetheart." "You're now my sweetheart" Like the clouds you've given my refuge. Like the rains you've drenched me with joy. And you've blown my mind like the storm. You've made my shaped my destiny in a way.. ...by bringing a new dawn in my life. I want to spend all my lifetimes with you. "Sweetheart." "You're now my sweetheart" "Sweetheart." "You're now my sweetheart" "Your grace." "You showered me with your grace." "Sweetheart." She used to live here. But it's been a year since she left. "You showered me with your grace." "You're now my sweetheart" "You showered me with your grace." Sometimes..you get a lifetime of love in a moment. And sometimes..even a lifetime isn't enough.. ...to find even a moment of love. If you're with me.. ...then we can star-t life anew. We must take some decision. I am ready.. "But before that. ...I must do something that's still incomplete. One, two..three..four..five..six.. Seven, eight..nine, ten..eleven. Twenty-four. Twenty-five. Twenty-six. twenty-seven. twenty-eight. Thirty-four. .thirty-five.. thirty-six. thirty-seven. ...thirty-eight. thirty-nine. forty. Forty-one. forty-mo“ forty-three. .forty-four.. 488.. 489.490. 491 ..492.. 496. .497 498..499.. 500! I knew it will be you. We'll meet again if destiny wants us. "Destiny wants it.." Because I wanted. I was looking for you like a madman. I've lost you so many times. ...that I'm even scared of closing my eyes now. But not anymore. I love you, Shruti. I love you. We've met..but unfortunately only to say goodbye. What do you mean? We cannot stay together. - Why? Because I said so. I see.. Only you have the right to decide. ...when we stay together and when we should separate? Akash, please. Is there someone else in your life? Are you.. Don't you love me? Every moment..every second. I only loved you, Akash. Then what's the problem. Not every question has an answer. And you can't be the only one to break hear-ts. Oh..now I get it. Revenge is more important for you than our love. I am sorry, Akash. Please go. Please. 'Will you marry me? - No.' 'Why? - Because we're still kids.' 'So..will you marry me when we grow up?' 'Then you must cut your hair. - Promise.' 'Do you promise? - I do.' Where is she? Who? - Shruti. Who are you? - I should be asking you that. She's my cousin. I am her doctor. What's the problem? What's the problem? Where is she? 'She's dying.' 'Severe Coronary Artery Disease.' 'Her chances of surviving without a hear-t transplant is impossible.' We had a word with the hospital. There is a brain dead patient. ...but her relatives aren't given their consent. If we get the consent. "Then we can save Shruti. We still have hope. You left me once. This time I'll leave. You came back.. "But I won't. A beautiful girl once told me. It doesn't matter how long we lived. What matters is how much we lived in those days. I have only few days. See..so many dreams. And you're all of them. That our story would be like this. It will be. Our story will be exactly like this. "I can change myself for you." "I can do anything for you." "That's my promise to you..forever." "I am breathing for you." "I am living each day for you." You are mine and I am yours..forever. "I've no right on myself anymore." "I am living only for you." "My love for you will never lessen." "I am living only for you." "You're mine and I am your support" "I am living only for you." Even if I die, I'll keep my promise. "I am living only for you." "I am living only for you." "It's not just our bodies.." ...it's our soul that's bound together. "Whenever anyone looks at me.." "..they see your face." You're my refuge..and I am your shadow. You're my home and I am your abode. You're my destination and I am the traveler. "And I've stopped at you." "I've no right on myself anymore." "I am living only for you." "Someday this age will pass." "And life will be complete." "But still stay close to me.." "..when my hear-t stops beating." I want to die..in your arms, sweetheart. "That's my last wish." "I've no right on myself anymore." "I am living only for you." "My love for you will never lessen." "I am living only for you." Any update, doctor? - No, not yet. It's really urgent. My patient is sinking. We're looking for a donor. Give me some time. - Doctor, we don't have time. Hurry up, for God sake, please. Yes, we're trying our best. We're completely ready.. ...but we haven't received a hear-t yet. Even Shruti's condition is critical. But in these conditions..there's nothing we can say. 'I am going to die and become a star.' 'The star that will shine the brightest..' '..will be me.' 'Don't forget to say hi.' 'Marry her..have kids.' 'Make another promise.' 'You won't come see me at the hospital. - But, Shruti..' 'Promise? 'Promise. 'Never break a promise, Akash.' We've found a heart. The doctors are prepared for the operation. Please sign here. 'The number you're trying to reach.' '..is currently switched off.' 'The number you're trying to reach.' '..is currently switched off.' Shruti..people say that. ...we take many births to complete our incomplete love. Meet each other again and again. I admit we couldn't meet this time. But we will definitely meet again. Won't we? I don't know. He hasn't come to the office for a month. And..l don't know. Even his mobile is switched off. Frankly speaking..none of us have any idea about this. Look, madam..we don't know how true this is. But people at the office are saying. ...that he accepted Mrs. Pablo's offer. And he's going to marry her.. I don't know, dear. He kept telling me.. ...that he's going to get a big contract. And he'll go to America. Maybe he got his contract. "Wait for few more moments." "..or come back to me again." "This isn't how you say goodbye." "Turn back or come home." My eyes look for you..and my arms yearn for you. "It's hard to live without you." "How can I live without you?" "It's hard to live without you." "How can I live without you?" "You made so many promises." But you broke them all in a moment. I know you're not a liar.. just a bit upset. If you're upset. I'll cajole you. "But where do I go without you?" "It's hard to live without you." "How can I live without you?" "It's hard to live without you." "How can I live without you?" 'Shruti, people say that.' '..we take many births to complete our incomplete love.' I admit we couldn't meet this time. But we will definitely meet again. Won't we? "The earth and the sky.." "..means nothing without you." Ask for a few more minutes of life.. "..Don't just get up and leave." Or take me along wherever you're going. "It's hard to live without you." "How can I live without you?" "It's hard to live without you." "How can I live without you?" No one knows whether it was an accident. ...or whether he killed himself. But the truth us.. ...he left his hear-t beating in my body. Smile.
