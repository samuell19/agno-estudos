What good would crying do? I should get a manual labor job. What will we do about my poor sister? She is on the graveyard shift list. It's nice to be making money and all, but... But how do you survive, if you work all-night? Factory Complex If I was able to reach out, I'd call my beloved But alas, I have nothing, I have nothing to my name Here we go! To the bright future of Industrial Complex for Export! One! Two! Three! 70' Female Factory Workers Cecil Theater, Seoul, South Korea You held her like this, right? This is the young Shin Sunae You pulled her up You feel sorry for her You can hold her hand, too Stop crying Minors under 18 needed parents' agreement, but I wasn't 18 yet Back then, at textile companies like Wonpoong or Dong-il many workers were hired under their older sisters' name After a few years of work they would change to their real name But Pyeonghwa Market was a place that hired anyone no matter what My throat always hurts because of the dust There was so much dust. The napkin would be black whenever I blow out my nose Too hungry to work! Too hungry to work! My phlegm and spit were always dark with dust Working 3 years at Pyeonghwa Market is enough to turn you into a patient No! Gyeongsuk! The YH(wig factory) Incident One day a seamstress didn't come to work Shin Sunae Hired in 1966 at Pyeonghwa Market Imprisoned and dismissed in 1977 One day a seamstress didn't come to work Shin Sunae Hired in 1966 at Pyeonghwa Market Imprisoned and dismissed in 1977 We'd been working together just a day ago but she suddenly disappeared I found out a few years later that she was raped by the tailor Courageous women these days would fight back But most women tend to avoid the situation Back then women were even weaker So some women had no choice but to disappear without a word But once I started hating it It was like hell The factory was dark and it leaked of sour smell Lee Chonggak Hired in 1966 and dismissed in 1978 by Dong-Il Corporation And the place was full of dust Lee Chonggak Hired in 1966 and dismissed in 1978 by Dong-Il Corporation Although we had partitions Although we had partitions the noise from the machines were so loud We used whistles to communicate I was only 18 when I started working But I worked 12, 13 hours a day I don't think we had sanitary pads back then So it was very difficult during my periods Especially in the summer... I would smell and my groins would hurt I also suffered from athlete's foot Some men burst through the union office and dared us to vote that day With leather gloves they smeared waste on us There was an old restroom next to the union office The men dug up human waste from there Hiring Female Production workers and waited through the night drinking Hiring Female Production workers They were hired by the company to prevent us from voting We needed photos for evidence of us smeared with waste... So we ran to a nearby photo studio and asked the owner to take pictures That's why we at least have some photos as evidences I believe it was at night The phone was ringing and people were running into my studio Lee Gibok Owner of Photo Studio near Dong-Il The phone was ringing and people were running into my studio Lee Gibok Owner of Photo Studio near Dong-Il It was hectic with so much commotion It was urgent and they didn't have time to explain They said, "Something terrible is happening." So they needed me to come and take some pictures for evidence One of the workers called Oh Cheongja was 5 or 6 years older than me She was the company's target When the waste bucket was almost emptied they put it over her head People may do anything to survive But what they did was horrible I've never told this to anyone but I cried alone in the studio as I developed the photos What they did was subhuman Tears just came out Naked Demonstration at Dong-il Textile Factory I've been running this studio for decades and I've met all kinds of people But those girls had the most innocent faces I haven't seen a purer face yet Everyone who lived here worked at the Guro Complex Usually, we never got off work at 7 or 5 We would come home at around 9, and have instant noodles together And we'd study until midnight And then we slept all together in this cramped room we were almost folded with each other And in the dawn, we woke up and took shower one by one It's nothing too serious But petty theft would happen Little things such as a slice of briquette would get stolen It was all just a part of life Now that I look back, it makes me sad But it's also a part of my memory, that's how my life was I don't know if we got tuberculosis from not eating enough Kim Yeongmi Hired in 1983 and dismissed and imprisoned in 1985 by Hyosung at Guro Industrial Complex I don't know if we got tuberculosis from not eating enough Kim Yeongmi Hired in 1983 and dismissed and imprisoned in 1985 by Hyosung at Guro Industrial Complex Kim Yeongmi Hired in 1983 and dismissed and imprisoned in 1985 by Hyosung at Guro Industrial Complex or if the bad working environment caused the disease But many workers came down with tuberculosis If you got the disease you had to quit Bars were worse than sewing factories Pretty workers who got sick would end up in bars If I ran into them on the streets they told me to ignore them and warned me not to end up like them I still remember their eyes The Bridge of Export President Park Geun-Hye was on TV the other day I still get the chills even thinking about it She said she'd give more opportunities to diligent workers But is there a worker in Korea who is not diligent? The passengers on the first bus of each morning are all workers Only workers take the first bus and subway to go to work They've worked hard all their lives But... Can they have a better life? Are they well-off? My sister said she'd send me to night school so I came to Garibong-dong in 1978 I started working for a small textile factory in Mapo as an assistant seamstress Kang Myeongja Hired in 1982 and imprisoned and dismissed in 1985 by Daewoo Apparel, Guro Industrial Complex I had to pull all-nighter everyday Kang Myeongja Hired in 1982 and imprisoned and dismissed in 1985 by Daewoo Apparel, Guro Industrial Complex But my sister's company seemed to have a better working environment So I transferred to Daewoo Apparel in 1982 Back then companies would team up with elementary schools or middle schools and pick up their graduates for work Before transferring there I would visit my sister at work and she'd be in uniform with a name tag and head scarf She would be sitting on the lawn during lunchtime and that looked so peaceful Because I'd never worn a school uniform her uniform looked so cool To wear that uniform, I'd ask her if her company was hiring People in the countryside especially older people think Samsung is the best Whether it be a factory job or an office job at Samsung the older people would all congratulate you for getting a job at Samsung From outside, it looked like such a big and peaceful company But once inside it wasn't the peaceful scene I had imagined but a living hell It was the same routine every day We'd work overtime and even all night if we were ordered to After working all night we'd take stimulants Have you ever had stimulants and coffee powder? Or coffee and energy drinks? Park Minsuk worked from 1991 till 1998 Samsung Electronics Breast Cancer The production lines where we worked were very clean Park Minsuk worked from 1991 till 1998 Samsung Electronics Breast Cancer The problem was the Isopropyl alcohol we used to clean the lines It seemed like a very hazardous chemical Working on semiconductors was known to be harmful for pregnant women Lee Seongok worked from 1995 till 2002 for Samsung Electronics Thyroid Cancer Working on semiconductors was known to be harmful for pregnant women Lee Seongok worked from 1995 till 2002 for Samsung Electronics Thyroid Cancer There were rumors of deformed babies So I quit as soon as I became pregnant for fear of my baby I've been working as a seamstress since 17 and the only time I could take a break was during my pregnancy and for a short period after I gave birth That break seems to be the only benefit for women Except for those periods all I did was work One colleague was infertile for 7 years so we shared the same concerns Another co-worker was infertile for 10 years One worker had uterine cancer and returned after being treated But she had trouble adjusting, so she quit Another worker's hair kept on falling out So she had to get hormone shots One morning, I swept my hair and my hand was full of hairs that had fallen out Kim Miyeon worked from 1997 till 2012 for Samsung Electronics Gestational Choriocarcinoma I feel like I'm going to cry whenever I talk about it... Kim Miyeon worked from 1997 till 2012 for Samsung Electronics Gestational Choriocarcinoma So I... It's okay, just tell it as it is. Miyeon hated having her head shaved, and so did I I had it shaved on a hospital bed I was recommended a person at the hospital who shaved heads As I lay down to shave my head, I felt very sad as a woman At first, the medication wasn't so strong High-Alert Medication At first, the medication wasn't so strong At first, the medication wasn't so strong My hair didn't fall out But later, the medicine started to wear off The doctor recommended I take a stronger medicine but explained that my hair would start to fall out Hearing that made my heart sink Some people might think losing hair is no big deal I also thought the same way But once it's about you, it becomes a serious issue So when I shaved my head at the hospital another patient who had shaved her head comforted me We organized a labor union in 1984 I was arrested in June, 1985 and imprisoned for one year They told me if I wrote a letter of apology I was free to go, but it felt so unfair If only they had adhered to the collective agreement... Making some concessions would've stopped our strikes The government announced the minimum wage as $100 back then A word of comfort, courage and hope for the others We weren't even paid the minimum wage A word of comfort, courage and hope for the others I still remember the younger workers saying I want to wear Nike shoes, too They put it on posters One of our slogans was "I want to wear Nike shoes, too" They were just 17, right out of middle school I adored them, but I've lost contact Guro Joint Strike Stop the oppression! Release the laborers! Is it twenty or thirty years ago? It is thirty years ago I think I was too afraid because I had been beaten so much in that boiler room underground I couldn't even cry My face was so much swollen, so it aches badly if I cry I remember, one day I was so terrified so I just flopped down and started crying while walking on the street There was a friend who just couldn't overcome the fear and got mentally ill think it was just too much for us to bear The security 365 days When I was in middle school my teacher asked me to present what my dream was I said, even it's nothing big or nothing so meaningful, Jang Youngsun Hired in 1982 and Forced resignation in 1985 by Garibong Electronics, Guro Industrial Complex I said, even it's nothing big or nothing so meaningful, Jang Youngsun Hired in 1982 and Forced resignation in 1985 by Garibong Electronics, Guro Industrial Complex Jang Youngsun Hired in 1982 and Forced resignation in 1985 by Garibong Electronics, Guro Industrial Complex for example, even if I happen to work in a factory Jang Youngsun Hired in 1982 and Forced resignation in 1985 by Garibong Electronics, Guro Industrial Complex and nobody appreciates, that is what I want to be And my teacher said, "you want to be a 'factory girl'?" That's a 'factory girl' Who makes these light bulbs and heaters? Workers do All men are equal under the sun So we should all be treated equally But the reality made me furious - Samsung should take a step for negotiations! - We want negotiations! Let's change Samsung! Let's change the world! Let's change our lives! If we just knew the truth while working at Samsung... Samsung is a company we can't hate It's like being dumped by someone I truly loved I can't get myself to hate that person because I still have some fond feelings left Young workers are still there They say the environment has changed and many works have become automatic I just hope no more workers are sick I was very healthy only two years ago It drives me crazy to think about what might happen to all the workers Leukemia Incident at Samsung Semiconductor Factory Gasan Digital Complex Gasan digital Complex Station was Garibong Station back then In 1992, if you got off Garibong Station you'd see job openings on the direction board I was searching for a job openings when someone offered me a good job He took me to Gabool Electronics It was my first time at a factory and overnight work was new to me I couldn't imagine working overnight I still remember my first day of work Kim Soyeon Hired in 2002 by Kiryung Electronics Kim Soyeon Hired in 2002 by Kiryung Electronics It was exciting to start a new job Kim Soyeon Hired in 2002 by Kiryung Electronics after leaving a company I worked for 8 years One day, my colleague complained about something to the manager She was a dispatched worker, just like me And the manager would just dismiss her for the day Then you have no choice but to leave At dinner, regular employees, contract employees, and the dispatched workers all sat at different tables This herbal liquor was popular back then And one of the dispatched worker really wanted to drink it So she asked for a bottle, but they didn't even pretended to listen But when a regular employee asked for the same, they ordered one for her right away We were all eating at the same time at a same place, it was ridiculous Kiryung Incident Many workers were fired before the labor union was formed in 2005 Normally, a colleague not showing up means he or she has a day off But for us, it meant that the person was fired The company mercilessly continued to fire many workers Only dispatched workers were dismissed before but contract workers were laid off once the union was formed Everyone stayed, ate and slept in the sit-in site for the first three days and most of them were women But some of them were very young and couldn't stay for too long because women are biologically different from men I could stop fighting and go to another company But will I be able to work as a regular worker then? Nope Hunger strikes can be tricky You do it to pressure the company and solve a problem But as it continues, your colleagues are more pressured than the company On the 94th day of hunger strike I hadn't slept all night and I was completely wiped out The union members got seriously worried They didn't want to trade my life for their demands So I was carried to the hospital Yet that wasn't the hardest part The most frustrating thing was that although I'd fought with my life nothing had changed Pullback! He's losing his grip! And legs are shaking! Hurry up! Why! How could you! People are risking their lives up there But no one even tries to listen to their demands You've killed lives instead of saving them! Why? The police have turned away from their original duty! Such life-risking struggles made the company and police take us seriously Then the negotiation reopened and the company has agreed to employ them back as regular workers I felt... at a loss? Kiryung Electronics Makes "Runaway Move" Leaving Union Members at a Loss I can't express in words how I felt Kiryung Electronics Makes "Runaway Move" Leaving Union Members at a Loss Kiryung Electronics Makes "Runaway Move" Leaving Union Members at a Loss At first I was so despondent Kiryung Electronics Makes "Runaway Move" Leaving Union Members at a Loss And then I became furious Because it was just outrageous Kiryung Electronics Fled overnight First News of the Year Makes the Union Disconcerted And then I became furious Because it was just outrageous Kiryung Electronics Makes "Runaway Move" Leaving Union Members at a Loss And then I became furious Because it was just outrageous Kiryung Electronics Makes "Runaway Move" Leaving Union Members at a Loss Kiryung Electronics Makes "Runaway Move" Leaving Union Members at a Loss Although the company hadn't kept its promise I thought the company would at least inform us before moving I never imagined they'd run away like that 50th Anniversary of Guro Factory Complex and Unveiling ceremony of 'the Statue of the woman of Export' September 16, 2014 A Factory Girl 50 years Ago A Temporary Employee 50 Years Later They ran away stealing all the money they made by taking a huge margin Life in the Bottom under Park Jung-Hui Not any better under Park Geun-Hye Life in the Bottom under Park Jung-Hui Not any better under Park Geun-Hye and all the damage, we laborers took it upon ourselves Life in the Bottom under Park Jung-Hui Not any better under Park Geun-Hye Low-pay, long hour labor That is the miserable reality we took upon The Base of New Industries I needed to make a living so I searched all the hiring notices I took a bus and got off when all other passengers did I thought it was the last stop But it wasn't Daewoo Corporation was there Its factory had about 12,000 workers at that time There's a song about seamstresses on sewing machines Seamstresses on sewing machines looked even cooler than a knight on a horse to me back then Their work was acknowledged Kim Jinsuk worked from 1981 till 1986 for Hanjin Heavy Industries & Construction Kim Jinsuk worked from 1981 till 1986 for Hanjin Heavy Industries & Construction I really wanted to go to college Kim Jinsuk worked from 1981 till 1986 for Hanjin Heavy Industries & Construction Kim Jinsuk worked from 1981 till 1986 for Hanjin Heavy Industries & Construction But that didn't work out Kim Jinsuk worked from 1981 till 1986 for Hanjin Heavy Industries & Construction The society I lived in made that impossible News reports about a bus attendant going to Seoul Nat'l University sounded like a rumor to me After all, what would be the chance for such a person to go to a college out of the thousands of hundreds? Then I also got a job as a bus attendant at Hwajin Bus After each shift, we had to clean the bus all the way up to its ceiling We would return to our rooms at 2 AM And we'd have to get back to work for the first bus at 4:15 AM It was really hard I could manage any job I used to again But I could never stand working as a bus attendant again I work on hundreds of clothes for a whole month but I couldn't afford to buy one for myself I'd work late night shifts as a bus attendant with swollen legs but still wouldn't be able to pay the rent on time Later I learned welding and obtained a license And I finally got a decent job I became a welder I thought my life would finally start to bloom I was 26 back then I was completely terrified Because my head was covered with a dark cloth on the way there That place makes you wet your pants They don't need to say a word or even raise a hand All the rooms were red The walls were all red On one wall there was a writing Let's get out of here alive I wondered who had wrote that message of survival In such a situation that one sentence became my strongest weapon in this world full of struggles When one dies, the corpse is normally laid on a wooden plank There were mortuary planks at that place It meant we were going to die We were stripped naked and given military uniforms I overheard the torturers saying they liked it better with us naked except for when the pieces of flesh falls apart Nevertheless I came out alive When I was leaving the place one torturer said he admired my strong determination He said "I hope you win" The enemy said so One Slip of a Tongue Top secret to the Enemy I wanted to ask him Why he had to take such extreme measures While I was on the crane, many people read my book, "Salt Flower Tree" They couldn't believe what had happened to me and asked how could I have endured such a life But it's not like I was given a choice to avoid all that I didn't choose to go to jail It wasn't my choice... to undergo anti-communist investigations Coming down from the crane I was asked what I wanted the most I replied I wanted to take a bath and then live with a choice But I've come to accept this as my life Everybody has different lives And this is how my life turned out I don't resent living such a life I don't regret my life The difference between life and death Is only a centimeter from the vital spot And there are times when even 10 seconds make such a difference Hanjin Industries Incident When I think that person could have lived if I had died the weight of my life becomes heavier than the earth Canadia Industrial Park Phnom Penh, Cambodia Where is your hometown?

Should we march forward now? After E-Land acquired it the name was changed to Homever Many customers told me E-Land was a Christian company and so I would be able to work Lee Gyeongok Hired in 2000 by Carrefour, dismissed in 2007 and so I would be able to work Lee Gyeongok Hired in 2000 by Carrefour, dismissed in 2007 in a better environment Lee Gyeongok Hired in 2000 by Carrefour, dismissed in 2007 Many Christian customers blessed me and encouraged me like that But E-Land turned out to be the opposite They changed the rest area into a prayer room And we prayed to achieve sales goals Our stores may be fancy and clean but workers have no place to rest Even the tiniest space was used to increase sales Employees were never taken into consideration With no decent facilities we sat on cardboard boxes and ate our lunch here We were quite pitiful I remember sitting here and eating with dust all around us Kim Jinsuk Hired in 2011 by A Mart I've met all kinds of customers Kim Jinsuk Hired in 2011 by A Mart Most customers give us their credit cards for a payment Some customers just throw them instead of handing them over I feel very humiliated as I pick up the thrown card Some costumers treat us in a degrading way Some of themselves may be non-regular workers or their children may be working as temporary employees somewhere The most shocking incident I have experienced here was hearing a mother scolding her children saying that if they didn't behave they'd end up working here later Kim Yeonhee Hired in 2010 by A Mart At the online shopping mall I work Kim Yeonhee Hired in 2010 by A Mart customers can shop with just a click Thank you for shopping with us A customer makes an order on the website The ordered products are classified into 6 categories Then we pick up the products using a PDA called Teampad We also check the expiration dates for dairy products or vegetables We shop for our customers and also make deliveries For example, if there are ten orders it must be completed in just a few minutes If it takes longer, we're marked with colored lines First it's blue then green, amber, and red We call it BGAR It's like a performance review score That is how the head office checks our speed It looks simple but it's complicated and difficult in reality Passengers aboard, let us show you the emergency procedures My first long-distance flight was to L.A. and it was too much to bear Kim Yeongsuk (Nom de Guerre) worked from 1988 till 2007 for A Airlines Kim Yeongsuk (Nom de Guerre) worked from 1988 till 2007 for A Airlines I was pretty athletic and fit I was pretty athletic and fit but it was just too hard for me So after my first flight I decided I would quit I just couldn't continue this work I didn't know flight attendants worked so hard On my first long-distance flight I couldn't sit down for 12 hours 12 hours in flight consumes 4 times the energy of 12 hours on ground I would always tell junior colleagues they were actors on stage The aisles were their stage and the passengers were their audience So they should do their best as professionals Please fasten your seatbelts whenever the seatbelt sign appears Insert the belt through the buckle and tighten Lift the cover to loosen during emergencies, oxygen masks will automatically fall from above Pull the mask toward your face and adjust the strings for a comfortable fit For the first round of the job interviews about 8 of us entered the room Everyone was so pretty that I felt like I was in a beauty pageant Each one of us had to closely approach the interviewer and smile naturally Kim Mingyeong worked from 2011 till 2013 for B Airlines Each one of us had to closely approach the interviewer and smile naturally Kim Mingyeong worked from 2011 till 2013 for B Airlines The interviewers told us to smile naturally not like monsters as we'd practiced I felt offended during that interview It was like they were selecting images instead of looking at our characters Kwon Sujeong Hired in 1995 by C Airlines We had to follow regulations for manicure color, nail length Kwon Sujeong Hired in 1995 by C Airlines earrings, rings, skirt length and clothes We undergo emotional labor plus beauty labor, as we call it We have to control our appearances We sit facing our passengers during take-offs and landings Once, a flight attendant sat across a Japanese passenger Flight attendants have to wear skirts because the company insists on it The Japanese passenger motioned for her to spread her legs apart It's hard to continue smiling to such a passenger Nevertheless, we have to smile in front of such passengers for a fear they might write complaints and effect our work evaluations Receiving a complaint or penalty points is what we dread the most We are pressured to avoid penalty points and receive bonus points So we have no choice but to exploit our emotions If you cause any damage to your team it becomes very difficult to work Once you receive a penalty point you're blamed for everything and even hindering the chief's promotion You have to try with all your might to avoid penalty points One passenger committed suicide by hanging himself in the lavatory We kept knocking on the lavatory and later pried the door open And as the body fell to the floor one flight attendant was knocked down under it Along with physical labor we have to consume our emotions as we work I didn't think it was right for her to continue such emotional labor So I requested to give her a vacation but it was refused Our next flight was by the same plane where the suicide had happened She couldn't go to the lavatory during the entire flight The most difficult thing for me was kneeling We are trained and ordered to kneel when talking to passengers I feel humiliated whenever I kneel I don't think kneeling is necessary to make a serviced customer feel good There are many other ways to make comfortable and pleasant eye contact I couldn't bear a system that treated me like a medieval slave The company thinks it has ownership over every part of its workers and has the right to consume them I feel like it's time to lose the pretentiousness And live out my life, which is only once Thank you for visiting our gas station Aiming for 100% satisfaction, putting the customers first we will return your trust with good quality and quantity I recently received a strange call asking if I'd ever masturbated Kim Yeonga Hired in 2011 by 120 Dasan Call Center I recently received a strange call asking if I'd ever masturbated At first I didn't know what he was talking about But the caller kept asking so in the end I hung up Such calls leave me in panic for at least 3 0 minutes It's terrible to receive such calls You're embarrassed to say anything I get very upset and wonder why I have to work like this One of my pregnant colleagues cried as she received calls I told her to stop and rest But she just continued answering phones while crying I felt sorry for her and told her to take a rest I tried to persuade her to stop receiving her calls But it's what we do It's our work We try our best not to show our emotions 120 Dasan Call Center 120 Dasan Call Center We have various duties at Dasan Call Center Calls come in for city hall water supply offices, and what not I don't know what kind of call I'll be receiving A red light blinks on my phone and it rings a melody Yang Seongyeong Hired in 2011 by 120 Dasan Call Center A red light blinks on my phone and it rings a melody Yang Seongyeong Hired in 2011 by 120 Dasan Call Center Then, I'm petrified because I don't know what kind of call it is I received each call trembling like a leaf For a whole year I dreaded the morning because I didn't want to come to work Technically, we're allowed to take breaks freely but we're monitored in real time for the calls we receive They check if we're on the phone or if we're out on a break Under such surveillance, it's not easy to take a break The number of calls and resting time are all reflected in evaluation Monthly evaluation scores influence our wages So nobody can take a comfortable break More calls results in a higher wage So nobody can take a real rest Colleagues become competitors I have to receive more calls We're ranked by call records and compared with competing companies This place is indeed a call factory We used to have factory girls in the past In the age of the Internet people are now guided in cyberspace with call center girls Many call counselors will be offended by what I've said There's the term "Working poor" I have to work to survive So I work really hard I invest my whole life at work But I'm still poor I can't pay for my child's extra-curricular activities My parents spent all their lives working I'm 45 years old So now I would like to give them monthly allowances but I can't But my parents also know I'm financially struggling They understand my situation but I always feel bad That is so painful We work hard in our twenties and throughout thirties and forties We work hard to take care of our family and parents but in reality that's not enough When I get older and sick if I can't take care of myself, I might have to choose to die That's how I feel Anxiety for an uncertain future Life at the edge of a cliff Please don't ignore us but listen to our cause The capable city of Seoul just continues to find excuses Call counselors are being torn from their jobs we want direct employment! We can no longer tolerate such inhumane actions we want direct employment! We want direct employment! With no lay-offs we demand the direct employment of all counselors at Dasan Call Center We will not watch the city of Seoul playing with our jobs We will fight until every counselor is directly employed We've suffered and endured until now without quitting We look forward to the day when we'll all work for the city of Seoul Extreme stress dealing with insults verbal abuse, and excessive demands! The service laborers are not a machine Shim Heesun Hired in 2010 by S geriatric hospital, Physical therapist Established a labor union in April, 2015 Dedicated to my mother who has worked in the sewing factory and all the women who fought to defend their labor rights In this tumultuous life, what is it that you hope for? If you have wealth, will it be enough? Under the blue skies and shining moonlight, I thought deeply And realized that everything was but a dream within a dream wealth is no different than a dream upon a hill in spring Even if you live a long life, it will fade in the blink of an eye If you drown yourself recklessly in debauchery And lose everything, will it be enough?
