(♪ "HURTS TOO MUCH" BY THE DENNIS BOYS BAND) Well, looks like we're here, mate. DYLAN: Yep. Let's go on, then. Hey not bad, not bad. JAY: I know, bright fella. DYLAN: (MUMBLES). JAY: Bright crowd in there too, mate? DYLAN: So, where are we sleeping again? Sleeping? JAY: Yeah. Sleep when you're dead, mate. Tonight, we party. You sleep wherever you land on, mate. (♪ "DON'T COME BACK" BY THE DENNIS BOYS BAND) (MUMBLES) one of those chicks from the ball baths, though. DYLAN: I told you they're hiding from you. Mate, I am like a (MUMBLES) bus. I pick out, and I drop off. Well, we going in or what? DYLAN: Yep. JAY: You might want to turn that camera off before we go in, mate. DYLAN: It's easy, what, this is something we're filming? Mate, I understand that, but the people inside they might think you're a bit of a strange bastard. DYLAN: Yeah, look, alright, I'll turn it off. But I'm taking it in and I'll see what it's like in there, and if it's alright I'll turn it back on (MUMBLES). Whatever, mate, whatever. DYLAN: Alright. (♪ "OUT IN EXILE" BY THE DENNIS BOYS BAND) I'll tell you what, there's someone to talk to you, right. JAY: Tell me about it, mate, eh? I feel like a kid in a candy shop. DYLAN: So, tell me more about this Hermie bloke. I've told you all you need to know, mate. Hey, she's not bad on the eye, ey? - DYLAN: You see that? - JAY: Yep. She was checking me out, mate. DYLAN: Yeah, she was checking you out. (♪ "GETTING OVER YOU" BY THE DENNIS BOYS BAND) Hey, you reckon I can join in there mate, or is it just for your girl? Oy, mate, fuck off. (JAY LAUGHS) (♪ "SMILE" BY THE DENNIS BOYS BAND) I wonder if she'd come back to my place, stare at the ceiling for a bit, eh? DYLAN: Hey, that was piss (MUMBLES). JAY: Checking me, as usual, eh? Oh hang on, what's going on here? That's that tool from before, man. She gave it to him. (GUITAR STRUMMING) (MUMBLES) fucking do this anymore, you best get the fuck out of my fucking life. (SPEAKING TRAILS OFF) Oh, hang on. (DYLAN LAUGHS) Look at this, alright? (DYLAN LAUGHS) Fucking have a look at this, would ya? Did I, or did I not tell you that Baradine was the place to on New Years Eve, mate? DYLAN: Yes, you did. - JAY: (MUMBLES EXCITEDLY) - DYLAN: Yes, you did. JAY: No way! (BOTH MOANING EXCITEDLY) DYLAN: Oh, god... JAY: Oh my, I'm going to get in on that shit, mate. DYLAN: What? JAY: Here you go, ladies. What the fuck, get out! (DYLAN LAUGHS) Are you fucking kidding, eh? They threw a fucking dildo at me, did you see that? (CHATTER) 10, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, Happy New Year! (CHEERING) Happy New Year, mate. DYLAN: Yeah, you, too, champ. I can't believe how far (MUMBLES). They get far (MUMBLES) all of them out, let me tell you. (BAGPIPES) DYLAN: They certainly do, I'll tell you what, I'm feeling it. Happy New Years, boys. JAY: And you. I don't know who you are, But I'm sure that I will. You guys want some glowsticks? DYLAN: Cool, thanks. (GIRL LAUGHING) Told you she wanted me, mate, eh? (JAY LAUGHS) Doesn't come close to Wolfy, though. - DYLAN: Oh, okay. - JAY: (MUMBLES) Oy. DYLAN: Oh, hello. Can you undo a trucker's knot? DYLAN: I don't know. That's good, cause I'm going to tie you up like it. What? (DYLAN LAUGHS) C'mon, Tam. Finally. JAY: Looks like you're buying my next beer, sweetheart. You spilled most of it when you bumped me before. Excuse me, mate? JAY: Alright, alright, I'll buy you one. I'll buy your pretty little friend here one, too. Is that so? DYLAN: I'll buy the drink, it's my turn anyway. You girls want one? Yeah, yes, please, that'd be nice. Get me anything, surprise. - Me, too. - DYLAN: Okay, cool JAY: Sounds like me, get her a trucker's knot, mate. LIZ: "Ha ha ha" very funny. What're your names, anyway? She's Tammy and I'm Liz. - You? - JAY: Tammy? A pretty name. (TAMMY LAUGHS) I'm Jay, this is Dylan. Dylan, Hey? Well, they're doing the Harley Davidson show, that's Neil, he's the dickhead. Get this, just 'cause he kissed Tammy once, he thinks that he owns her. - DYLAN: Uh huh. - What an idiot. We're of them, right? No need to advertise it, Liz. JAY: You want to come outside for a smoke? Yeah, I would. JAY: Let's do it. (DYLAN HUMS "HERE COMES THE BRIDE") Oh, settle down, settle down. Hang on, hang on, Dylan. Ah, for fuck's sake. What're you filming? You filming me, mate? DYLAN: I'm not filming you, don't even know ya. Why don't you just fuck off, Neil? She's not interested, can't you get it, mate? Shut up you drunk ass skank. She's not your type, Neil. Don't you usually like 'em dead? Look, shut the fuck before I flog you like the bitch you are. Why don't you have a crack and then a kneel, you fucking nibble? Neil, I said I'm not fucking interested, fuck. See? There are loads of other lovely women here tonight, can't you just leave me alone. Look mate, turn that camera off or I'll shove it up... You can come and watch if you like, I heard you like to watch. Yeah, keep going, mate, keep going. You want to see where you're finishing all the... Turn that fucking camera off. Fuck off... Say "hi" to your mom for me, fellas! Jay, they're throwing bottles! Come on, let's go, let's go. (JAY SHOUTING) (LAUGHTER) Jeez, that was exciting, wasn't it? Happy New Year, everyone. So, what's everybody's New Years Resolution, then? LIZ: I never make 'em, cause I always break 'em. DYLAN: Yeah, me, too. I just want to get out of Baradine and hit up the (MUMBLES) Hermie place. Who's "Her-mie Puh-by"? Oh, it's not an old hermit mate of mine, who lives out there in the Pillaga scrub. Well, why do they call him Hermie (MUMBLES)? All his ex-wives took him to the cleaners, mate. Took him for everything he owns. He's out there in the Pillaga scrub by himself. You know what, so sad. Yeah, got him well and good, but uh, not too keen on women now, as you can imagine. What? Don't get your panties in a bunch, girls. You'll be alright, you're with me. Ain't I his mate? DYLAN: Sounds like love. Get fucked, would you mate? And turn that camera off, too, give us a rest, would ya? (♪ "OUT ON THE BELT" BY THE BLOWFLYZ) DYLAN: We're going back to the Pilliga? Bloody 'roos. Always harder to see after the rain. DYLAN: They're not that bad, are they? You got no idea, mate. Tammy, I've got a surprise for you. Oy. Rise and shine, TimTam. DYLAN: Is that what I think it is? What, Viagra? It'd have to be Niagara to keep him wet. Here you go. Whoa, where are we? Almost at Hermie (MUMBLES), not far now, mate. Want one? TAMMY: How long have I been asleep for? Bit over a half an hour or so, - Nah, man. - Since we left the pub. I'm fine. Do you see that sign? Yup. And? And nothing, mate. Just keep cycling your purse (MUMBLING), darling. DYLAN: Jay, that said national park. (♪ "NOT RIGHT NOW" BY CHRIS E. THOMAS) (CICADAS BUZZING) Why did all his exes leave him? He seems like a poor old bloke. Eh, darling, goes a little something like this. When a man meets a woman, he wants her to stay the same. And when a woman meets a man, she obviously wants him to change. So, when they break up, he's got the shits cause she has changed, and she's got the shits, cause he hasn't. That is why men and women should not live in the same houses with each other. Instead, they should live in separate houses besides one another. Quite the little philosopher aren't you, Jay? I am. You're not one of those sensitive "new age" guys, are ya? Yeah, right. Think you got me a little bit confused with your boyfriend over there. I'm more of a caring, understanding 90s type, as you like to say. DYLAN: Welcome to another episode of Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous. (ENGINE HUMMING) We're nearly at Hermie's now, so... When we get there, you guys let me do the talking, alright? Yeah. DYLAN: Yeah, sure. You've got nothing to worry about, girls. He knows me. LIZ: He's not going to have a (MUMBLES) because we're women, is he? JAY: Not if you keep your trap shut and let me do the talking, you ain't. LIZ: Look at all this shit at this place. (♪ "IN THE DAM" BY LEE FORSTER) JAY: Hermie! Hermie (MUMBLES). Hermie, where are ya? Watch your step, girls. Hermie, you old bastard. Hermie! (PARROT TALKING) Hermie, you crazy old bastard, where are ya? What's your plan tonight? (MUMBLES) want breakfast? TAMMY: Who's Peter, man? JAY: That's what he call me because I love his fucking (MUMBLES). TAMMY: Peter? Yeah, you know, Tam. Peter, Peter, Pumpkin-Eater. JAY: Hermie! Where are ya, mate? Are you sure we should be in here? JAY: Yeah, we'll be alright. LIZ: What's that a drawing of? It's a pig trap. (MUMBLES) the one to kill you in the pub last night. Fuck you. JAY: Later, Liz, later. More concentrated on finding Hermie right now. DYLAN: Hey, Jay, look at this. JAY: Yeah, what's up? DYLAN: Quick, come here. Hermie's drawn a picture of your mum. JAY: (MUMBLES) real funny, mate, real funny. LIZ: What is it? JAY: That is an (MUMBLES) myth, that's what that is. Depending on who you ask, of course. What's that smell? I know, man, yeah. JAY: It's probably something dead, maybe a rural rabbit. LIZ: What? Hermie! Never understood why Hermie has a curtain, his window doesn't even have any glass. Might as well close the curtain you silly bastard. (SCOFFS) DYLAN: I don't know about Hermie, Jay, but I've definitely found Kermie. (LAUGHS) LIZ: No one's here, Jay. Looks like they haven't been here for a while. DYLAN: Look, the calendar's marked November 30, so he's been here the last month, at least. TAMMY: What if something happened to him? Then I'll deal with that, alright? Can't be too far, he often wanders. Bullshit, nobody leaves like this, mate, I think you're having us on. Alright, once you meet him you'll understand. He's got to be still alive, his car's out in the front. Can't be too far, wherever he's going, he's got to be on foot. Well, you and me might have to have a bit of a wander, Dylan. DYLAN: Yeah, alright. What about us? Well, you girls gotta wait back in the car. I don't want to take you shirtless (MUMBLES) before I've got the chance to give him a heads up. Shirt's made fine. Leave that camera in the car, too, mate. I wasn't going looking for a dirty old bastard in the bush anyway. Well you found us, didn't ya, eh? Better than finding a dirty old bastard in your bush. DYLAN: You bringing the dog? Yeah, mate. He'll help up find him, won't you boy? Huh, won't ya, come on, good boy. Alright, you girls stay in the truck. Hermie comes back, tell him we've gone to look for him, alright? TAMMY: Will do. Do we tell him we're with Peter or Jay? Well, stay in my truck and he'll know you're with me. Can you leave your keys, at least? Yeah, okay. Don't go leaving that radio on, though. If that battery goes dead, we'll be stuck here alright? And don't go going through me shit, either, alright? I'm not an idiot, Peter. Alright, to you it's still Jay. DYLAN: Anyway, Liz, here's the camera. Can I film? DYLAN: Yep. TAMMY: I can't say this is my idea of New Years, but you know what, these guys are nice. LIZ: Yeah, not mine either. If Dylan wasn't so hot, I wouldn't stayed in Baradine. (TAMMY LAUGHS) So, how're you feeling? TAMMY: I guess I'm feeling a little bit better. Just needed to get away from that asshole, you know? LIZ: Can you tape back over it? TAMMY: You're asking the wrong person. You know what, Dylan's a catch. You struck it gold. LIZ: I know man, thanks. (♪ "SLAUGHTERING OF LAMBS" BY THE NOFFS) Oy, I've got an idea. Want to do something naughty? Naughty? Jay said we can't leave the car. LIZ: Not that kind of naughty. What do you want to do? LIZ: Well, you know, I want to leave a surprise message on Dylan's camera. Something to remember us by. Alright, what do you got in mind? LIZ: Yes! Follow my lead. (♪ "BEER AND LIPSTICK" BY BRYEN WILLEMS) (LIZ LAUGHS) Thought we were going to all the way, didn't you Dylan? You thought wrong! God, you're a bitch. Damn straight! Dylan seemed more keen to go off with Jay than he did to stay here with me. Your loss, Dylan. God, you're bad. Bad to the bone, baby. Like my breast friends? Best sex you never had, Dylan. Anyway, ready? Let's do it. Okay, I think it's on. Yeah, baby. You could've seen what was under that, Dylan. Yeah! LIZ: Yeah girlfriend, whoohoo! (♪ "DEEP DOWN I'M SHALLOW" BY BRYEN WILLEMS) Hey, put the radio on, would you? Yeah, I would if I could actually get a station out here. Of course you can, it's not like we're on Mars. We may as well be. I'll do it then. (STATIC BUZZING) TAMMY: You've got to actually tune it in (MUMBLES) at least. That's what I'm doing. TAMMY: This is all you. Shit. (♪ "OPEN UP YOUR HEART" BY G. WAYNE THOMAS) Here we go, here we go. Yes, I love this song. Mum used to play it all the time. Yeah, it sounds like something my mum would really enjoy. Shh, don't interrupt. God you weren't wrong when you said you loved that song. Shh, (MUMBLES). MAN OVER RADIO: I just want to let you know that if I find ya. Hello, yes, we're here. Hello? That sounded like Neil. Don't be stupid. Man, I knew I should've stayed back there and talked to him. What? Look, he obviously cares about me. He's out here in the bush looking for me. He said that he'd kill us, Tam. He said that he'd kill Jay, not us. Jay gave him what he deserved. He's going to be sore and sorry. It's not even Neil, he's probably at home sleeping it off. Get back on the two-way and find out. What? Please. Look, we don't have to tell him where we are straight away. Is that you, Neil? Look, I'll tell you where we are as long as you promise to treat Tammy better. I'm gonna get my undies. Tam... Is that camera off? Oh, shit. Liz, come on, let's go. - I want to get outta here. - I'm coming, just a sec. Dylan, Jay, when you get this message, I just want to let you know that what you guys did sucks, okay? The keys are still in the ignition. Good bye and good riddance. And by the way, if something does happen to us, it'll be your fault. Come on, Liz. Well, not in Hermie's hut, mate. DYLAN: No, I know, I had a look on the camera, they've definitely gone. What? DYLAN: No, they're gone. You're kidding, aren't you? DYLAN: Nah. Fuck. This is all I fucking need, fuck. DYLAN: Look, we'll find 'em. Surely they can't be that far. Yeah, well, good to see they left the keys in the ignition, eh? Give 'em that much. Fucking bitches. Yeah, mate, yeah, I can still see their footprints, mate. DYLAN: Okay. That's a start, isn't it. Can't be too far, mate, can't be too far. Oh, there's one. Hang on. Oh yeah, there they are. There they are. JAY: You are right, mate. Well, I'm going back even if they're not right. I've gotta go back, so, they can either stay, or they can come. DYLAN: Yeah, fair enough. Alright, you've got your reasons, you've made your point. What took you so long? DYLAN: Jay's dog went missing, we can't find it. Liz! Liz! Liz wait a sec! LIZ: What? TAMMY: Look, the reason why the boys took so long is cause Jay lost his dog. LIZ: What? TAMMY: Jay lost his dog. You know Wolfy, he's gone. JAY: We found you, though, does that count? Fuck off. DYLAN: Look. Please, Liz, just hop in the truck, alright? We'll help him find his dog, then I promise we'll take you wherever you want to go, okay? Anywhere but here, Dylan. DYLAN: Come on, hop in. Sorry we took so long, okay, but we've genuinely been looking for the dog. TAMMY: Okay. We thought we'd head out on the highway, and then someone would probably pick us up, you know? You girls ever hear of Arthur (MUMBLES)? Thanks for leaving that message that we came back to, by the way Liz. Yeah, real funny. DYLAN: It was! Real funny, yeah, yeah, yeah. DYLAN: Doesn't matter, doesn't matter. It's whatever. I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said what I said. We shouldn't have walked off like that. Yeah, no shit, Liz, eh? You would've got lost before you got out, mate. I just thought that we could get along the road. DYLAN: Look, Jay, enough for a second okay? There hasn't been any real harm done, alright? (JAY MUMBLES) Hang on. Find the dog, and then we can all go wherever we want to go, kay? Yes? Fine by me, mate, fine by me. - Okay. - Yeah. - Alright, good. - Sounds awesome. (DOG BARKS) DYLAN: What is it now, Jay? Shut up. - What? - DYLAN: What? Shut up! You hear that? - Hear what? - What, Jay? That! (BARKING) It's Wolfy. For fucks sake. - Wolfy, wolfy! - DYLAN: Come on. Come on, let's do the right thing. Wolfy, where are ya, boy? DYLAN: Help him find his dog, come on. Are you guys going to get out back there and help or what? - LIZ: Go. - DYLAN: Come on. TAMMY: Yeah, of course we are. Wolfy! Wolfy! - DYLAN: Wolfy! - TAMMY: Wolfy! JAY: Wolfy, you alright, boy? (WHISTLING) Wolfy! LIZ: There's that smell again. DYLAN: Wolfy! LIZ: It's that same smell from Hermie's place, JAY: Wolfy, come here boy! LIZ: Can you smell that, Dylan? (CROW CAWING) - DYLAN: Wolfy, wolfy! - JAY: Where are ya boy? LIZ: Wolfy!

DYLAN: Oh my god... The girl in the bath? LIZ: You guys know her? JAY: Right, all of you, go get back in the truck, right? Go on. LIZ: Come on, Tammy, come on. Come on! Come on, come on... CICADAS BUZZING: (BIRDS CAWING) LIZ: What the fuck are you doing, Jay? JAY: What's it look like I'm doing, Liz? Dumping the body in the pig wallow. You're going to what? Liz! You better act right, I've got enough shit to deal without being stuck for this. So you're a fucking criminal. DYLAN: Hardly, he didn't kill her. He's not a criminal, no one is. And that makes it okay, does it, Dylan? He's a fucking criminal. No worse than you, you drug dealing whore. Finding shit, mate, enough have used. That's fucked, I don't want anything to do with you, or any of your fucking problems! What would you have me do, Liz, eh? We're in a national park, we're all pissed, you're all fucking high from your purse lollies. We've got our spew and prints everywhere. Added to which, I can't find me fucking dog. So tell me, Liz, what the fuck would you have me do? Call the police! You obviously weren't listening to a word I fucking said. The cops and I don't see eye to eye at the moment. You're fucked, you know that. DYLAN: Liz! Fuck up, Dylan, she's not going to fuck you just because you take her side. Oh fuck you, Jay. DYLAN: That's not what I meant! Jesus Christ. (TAMMY CRYING) Turn that fucking camera off, mate. DYLAN: The camera proves we're innocent, you fuckwit, it gives us every reason to call the police. - Dylan's right. - I agree! He's fucking wrong, that's what he is, right? DYLAN: Jesus Christ. I'm dumping the body in the fucking pig wallow. DYLAN: Oh, god... The pigs will eat her before sundown. DYLAN: Jesus Christ. Look, I say we go to the cops, Jay, alright? We could always say we got lost in the scrub, and maybe they'll us off with a warning for being in a national park with a dog, alright? Look, I can even say it's my dog, alright? Do I look like the kind of dickhead that gets warning? Do I!? You fucking clean skins, you'll get a slap on the wrist, not me! We can vouch for you! It's not going to cut it, Tammy! Then they're going to go through my truck, they'll find my fucking guns, my knives, and your fucking pingers, then what? DYLAN: Christ. Look, I'm dumping the body in the fucking pig wallow. Alright? Then we're all going to walk out of here, and not gonna say another word about it. - You understand? - DYLAN: Jay. Jay, just listen for a second. If it is that chick from the ball baths, then where's her friend, eh? She might have seen you take the body. I don't give a fuck, Dylan. Maybe she killed her, eh? Maybe someone killed 'em both! Yeah, someone like your mate Hermie. DYLAN: Fucking Jesus... Jay, Jay, Jay! - You fucking slut. - DYLAN: Jay! You've been a thorn in my fucking side since I met you. I swear to god, fucking, I'm gonna fucking... You're gonna what!? You're going to dump me in the pig wallow, too? DYLAN: Tell them to please stop this. Jesus Christ. I didn't say that, did I? DYLAN: Jay, threatening her isn't going to change what happened, alright? All I'm saying is... DYLAN: Fucking Christ. It's a long walk out of here, people. Especially at night. DYLAN: Fucking hell. What if there is someone out there, huh? Doing something fucked up, huh? You're all going to find out, here, on your walk out. If you walk out, that is. DYLAN: Jesus. Look, Jay, just listen, right? What if the same person that got this girl, got Hermie, or got her friend, huh? Would you do the same to him? I don't give a fuck! DYLAN: Or what if they're alive? JAY: Mate. DYLAN: Jesus Christ. JAY: I swear to god, mate. Turn that fucking camera off. LIZ: This is (MUMBLES)! I don't have to listen to this. I'm fucking leaving. Fuck! - DYLAN: Liz! - No!! Give me my bag, give it to me, Tammy! DYLAN: Liz, Liz, Liz don't! LIZ: Fuck! - DYLAN: Liz! - JAY: Fuck off! - DYLAN: Liz! - LIZ: Fuck you! DYLAN: Liz! TAMMY: Jay, I would think twice about this, don't you, you don't know, but, Liz's uncle is a cop. LIZ: You! You're a fucking disgrace! What if that was your sister, or your daughter out there? - DYLAN: Liz! - LIZ: Fuck! JAY: Fuck her. I'm gonna... - TAMMY: Jay... - JAY: What? I'm dealing with this before I fucking deal with her. Thank you very fucking much. Turn that fucking camera off mate, or I swear to god. Don't go getting any ideas, we're throwing away that fucking tape. DYLAN: Card. JAY: What? DYLAN: It takes cards! JAY: You're kidding, aren't you, mate? I've got a fucking dead body on the back of my truck, and you're fucking talking about cards? I don't care if it takes Valium, mate, that's the way it's happening, alright? (ENGINE RUMBLING) (CICADAS BUZZING) (JAY SIGHS) (TAMMY CRYING) (BIRDS CAWING) (ENGINE RUMBLING) I didn't want this, Tammy. I didn't want any of this. None of us did, Tammy, alright? But it's done, right? I've protected you. I've protected you, Dylan, and I've protected your fucking mate, Liz. You should be thanking me, not sitting there fucking spitting at me! You fucking bastard. You bastard! You bastard, you bastard. Fuck! There she is. She's out there on the road. Lizzy! Liz! Liz, Liz, get in the car! JAY: What, are you going back in the scrub, Liz? What? TAMMY: Look, irrespective of what's happened, and what we're all thinking, walking out of here now is crazy! We shouldn't have even done it before, Liz, get in the car! Tammy, what we've done is wrong! That body, that girl, don't you even care about her? TAMMY: Lizzy, we'll sort it out. JAY: Now listen, you've been a drug dealer, Liz. LIZ: Fuck you, that's different! JAY: Come on, mate, hop back in the car. - TAMMY: Please, please? - JAY: Right? Nothing else we can do about it, what's done is done, alright? TAMMY: Lizzy, please, get in the car! JAY: Listen to your friend, Liz, alright? Want to come back out here and relive the whole thing in Inbred Jed-ville, huh? Through the courts? You really want to do that, do ya? Come on mate, hop in the car. Fucking hop in the car! (ENGINE RUMBLING) Fuck me! DYLAN: What? Fucking cops. Shit. - Shut up! - Shit, what are you gonna do! - Shut up, right? - Oh my god, oh my god. Put your seat belts on. Put those fucking drugs away, Liz. I swear to god, I don't want to hear a peep out of any of ya, right? I'll handle this. (CICADAS BUZZING) Officer. - License, please. - Yes, sir. - Bloody hell. - I shot a cop. - (MURMURING) - DYLAN: Don't look at him. COP: Is your name Peter Jackson? JAY: Yes, sir. COP: Is there anyone traveling in the sleeper cab behind the seat there? JAY: No, sir, no. COP: Have you seen a black Toyota Land Cruiser utility? JAY: No. COP: The driver is described as a white male, approximately 30 years old, 190 centimeters tall, heavy set, approximately 110 kilos, brown hair, green eyes, a brown beard, and wearing a Harley Davidson shirt. JAY: No. No, sir, haven't seen anyone like that around here. COP: You do know I'll run your license and plates when I get back to the station. Give me a call when you get back in phone range. If you do see anything. If I was you, I'd make my way to the Pilliga now. JAY: Will do, sir. COP: And drive safely. JAY: Thank you. DYLAN: Jesus Christ. Shit head. DYLAN: He's still following us. What? Yeah, that's cause he knows you're a liar, Peter. No, to you it's Jay. I'm only going to get a year for my crimes. What do you think you'll get, hey? When he finds your bad of drugs. TAMMY: He knows we're lying. He knows we're lying, so he's going to come back and get us! LIZ: Well what are you going to do when he does come back? JAY: I will handle that! TAMMY: I'm just gonna come clean with him. Shoot, he's getting closer. Thank god, he's turned off. Well, it looks like we know who killed that girl, huh? You know that girl... That could have been me! Bet you you're glad I rescued ya. (ENGINE RUMBLING) (BIRDS CAWING) DYLAN: We will forget about this, you know. One day. Eventually. (ENGINE RUMBLING) (LIZ WHISPERS) DYLAN: Liz, Liz. (LIZ WHISPERS) DYLAN: We couldn't call the cops even if we wanted to. (LIZ WHISPERS) DYLAN: There's no phone service out here anyway, right? And we don't know where we are. (DOG BARKING) DYLAN: Alright, was that...? JAY: Wolfy! TAMMY: It's that smell again. DYLAN: Was that Wolfy? - (FLIES BUZZING) - JAY: Wolfy! - TAMMY: Oh shit. - DYLAN: What're you doing? Get the fuck out of the way.

JAY: I'm alright! DYLAN: Jay! - DYLAN: Jay? - Last time, he disappeared... He was gone for four fucking hours! TAMMY: I think we should just wait for him. DYLAN: Jay, can you hear me? LIZ: What, like last time, Tammy? When we wasted half the day? DYLAN: Well it's either that or we can look for him in fading light. TAMMY: Fuck. (FLIES BUZZING) LIZ: Maybe we should wait in the truck. I agree. DYLAN: Fuck. (ANIMALS CHITTERING) DYLAN: Shhh, do you hear that? LIZ: What? (ANIMAL GROWLING) (ANIMAL GROWLING) DYLAN: Nah, it's probably just a possum. LIZ: I can smell that smell again. Can you smell that? (FLIES BUZZING) DYLAN: Wind up the window.
