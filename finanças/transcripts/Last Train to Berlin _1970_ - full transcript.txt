(MultiCom Jingle) (machines whirring) (explosion booming) - [Narrator] The armies of Nazi Germany were a devastating war machine. When the tide had turned and Hitler's legions were in retreat, the disciplined soldier was replaced by an outlaw mercenary or Nazi collaborator who introduced a reign of blood as the Germans were moving out. (guns firing) The Allied war office put into action one last secret mission. The mission was to help Yugoslav partisans sabotage and derail the last German train to Berlin carrying off the country's last gold reserves. As liaison officer for the allies, the war office selected the perfect man. He was a natural. Now an American OSS officer, he was born in the region. In fact, I am told he volunteered mainly because of the hope of finding his father. Mateo, a young fierce partisan leader demolition expert met the major and the mission began. (dramatic instrumental music) - Lieutenant Soontz, I'm here. (eerie music) (wheels creaking) - The war is lost for Germany. You have to take this cargo train to Berlin. It is the Fuhrer's command. - I understand, sir. - Our last monetary and valuable gold reserve from all Eastern Europe are in your hands. The cargo train will look very simple. Our mercenaries still control Uskoplje Pass. Gavran and his men are in the hills and Gavran's brother Yanko is the stationmaster. Uskoplje is the only route left. You have to get through. That's all. You may go now. - Yes, sir. - Good luck, Lieutenant. (lively instrumental music) (suspenseful music) (horse neighing) (tense instrumental music) - Looks like Nevada. - The war will be soon over, Major. - I hope so. - Some of my men are coming down with you. - Thanks Mateo, you're gonna need all your men to blow the bridge. - I don't think you should go alone. - I've come this far alone. Besides, you're gonna need somebody to tell me when that train's coming through. You just keep your mind on that bridge, Mateo. - Don't worry, Major. I'll do it. That German train will never pass that bridge. Shall we part, Major? This is the way to Uskoplje. - You be careful with those charges, now. Don't overload 'em. You'll blow yourself to kingdom come. - I hope you find the man you are looking for. - I will. - Be careful. This is Gavran's town. The switchman is your own contact. - Thanks. Heh, this Gavran, he must scare you a little. - He doesn't scare me. - Oh no? - Maybe a little. (gentle instrumental music) Major, as soon as I get there, I'll let you know. Good luck! (suspenseful music) - Double check them into the village. - All right, if anything should happen, Gavran, I will let you know. And watch Vitripol, too. - Has anything strange happened in town? - Gavran. - I'll have time for that later, but first the Germans must cross that bridge without trouble and I'll make sure they do. (suspenseful music) You were a long time without a man, huh? - Where is Gavran? Where is Gavran? Gavran! Gavran. Garvran, it looks like the partisans are moving towards the bridge. - Huh? - They will soon be at the stone pit. - Get my horse ready! - Yes. (lively instrumental music) - Hi. Hi. Take the explosives. Let's go. (suspenseful music) (suspenseful music) It looks like a cemetery. (suspenseful music) - Fire. (gun firing) (guns firing) (explosions booming) Fire. (somber instrumental music) I saw Charuga run away. Get him and lock him up in the Uskoplje. I never did trust him. - [Man] Yes, Gavran. - Make sure everything down there is all right, report back to me. (suspenseful music) You say one of them got away. - Yes, Gavran, but he goes to Uskoplje. - Yanko is there. Find him! Just keep around that mountain. You let me know if a blade of grass moves. Let's go. It's the special train of the German High Command. I'm not going to let those partisans mess around in my territory. (suspenseful music) (gentle instrumental music) - Hello. Who's in charge of the station? Anybody live in that wagon over there? - The switchman, he is a cripple. Who are you looking for? - Oh, I just came to catch a train, but thanks. Hi boy. What's your name? - My name is Tisa, what's yours? - They call me the Major. - My father is stationmaster here. - Oh? - His name is Yanko. You must have heard of him. He is Gavran's brother. - Yeah. (suspenseful music) You Yanko? (lively instrumental music) You're the stationmaster here, huh? You must feel alone. - I see that you are alone. I know that your men are all in trouble up there. The Germans have you surrounded, right? A mountain goat couldn't get out of there unless he uses the bridge, right? The way I see it, you are alone. (suspenseful music) - He's not very friendly. What's wrong with him? - He's always like this when he smells trouble in the mountain. He is just like his brother, Gavran. - Leave us, Marta. I want to talk to this man alone. - Call me the Major. What's wrong with her? - Marta used to be happy. She changed when the war began. And what are you here for? - How many phones you got in this place? - Yanko has one, but on the same line. That's all I do, watch him. (suspenseful music) - What do you want? - I must speak with Gavran. - Why? - There's a stranger in town. - Leave the American to me. (suspenseful music) That's what I'm here for. - Gavran has a phone near the bridge to keep in touch with Yanko. - Yanko the boss around here, huh? The stationmaster? - I used to be in charge of the station. When Gavran and his foreign gang came here, they're fighting with their backs to the wall. - And you? How did you get here? - Before the war, I had a bad accident. Now my legs are useless. I came out of hospital and I became a nobody here, a useless cripple. Marta, Marta? I can't do a thing without her. - I'll get her. (suspenseful music) When's he coming? - Hmm? - Gavran. - Let me pass. - I asked her if she phoned Gavran. One of our men was stationed here. (gentle instrumental music) He played the guitar. They called him the Guitarist. I'm looking for him. Where is he? - He lived here in this town. I can no longer move out of my chair. I haven't seen him lately. I don't know where he is now. They say he left when those thieves came through. - I don't have to call Gavran. As soon as he knows you're here, he'll come. What brings you here, Major? - Huh, man gets lonely out in those hills. - Why didn't you cut the telephone wires? - Huh, you know everything that goes on around here, don't you? I want everything to look natural when the Germans come through, and for Gavran. - If you want any information about Gavran, why don't you ask Yanko? - I'll do that. (guitar strums) Yanko, where's Tisa? - That's my business. Leave my boy alone. - Did you send him on an errand? Tell me, Yanko, where do I find the Guitarist? - Someplace down there. (gentle instrumental music) He came around the time this war began, just after the cripple arrived. - That's not the answer I'm looking for, Yanko. Where does he live? - Do you know him? - Mhm. - Did the cripple tell you about him? (laughs) Yeah, Tisa and I enjoyed listening to him play. I got work to do. - Gavran? Gavran? Gavran? Lovely air. Gavran? Come on, Bailey. Come on. (grunting) - Watch it. - We'll go this way. - The order was different. - They're not expecting us. Come on. (suspenseful music) (grunting) (gasping) (yelling) (grunting) (fists thudding) (sighing) Don't worry. You're coming with us. - He can't make it. - We are taking him. (grunting) The mountain's full of them. - We are in trouble. We lost half our power, equipment, and explosives. - Wait for me here. - You, keep a look out. Move! (suspenseful music) (grunting) - We have more luck than brain, Mateo. - Move, come on! (lively instrumental music) - You say there's good news. Well, what about it? All this is no good to me, is it? When this damn war's over, everybody'll be happy, but what do you think I can do? - What about you? - A cripple like me is no use to anyone. Finished, huh? (laughing) (suspenseful music) (yelling) Ha, nevermind people have short memories. Maybe in time Uskoplje will get a new name and so nobody will remember any of this sadness. (grunting) - So far, everything I've done has been wrong. - It's not your fault. Nobody expected a bunch of foreign renegades. They came out of nowhere. - [Mateo] We lost many men. - [Man] Regardless of the cost, we have to do our job. - You and the Major are alike. Your objective is more important than your people. - [Man] The Major will be in trouble down there. We better send one of our men to help him with the train. - Now they know we're here. - They do, but not the Germans. When we cut the wires, they won't have time to alert the Germans. - I got to find out something about the Guitarist. Gonna take a look around. (suspenseful music) - Well, coward, this is it. Your Casanova days are coming to an end. - Hey, how long will I be in this place? Commander Gosier? - Heh, well, that's too bad. When Gavran comes here, he will know how to deal with you. Get in. Okay, you go there. I'll take care of our lover man. - [Yanko] I don't want to hear any more about the Major. - [Tisa] But he came to help us. - You stay away from him, you hear me! (suspenseful music) - Why's your father angry with you? - He doesn't want me to talk with you. - What's he afraid of, that I'm gonna find out about the Guitarist? - Major, you are not welcome in Uskoplje. Go away and play. - Why don't you leave the boy alone? - He's my boy. - That's no reason to beat him. - Major. I can't see that you are going to live long around here. - Nor you. That is, not unless Gavran surrenders. - We go on, we don't give up, not that easy. (whistling) - Get back, you. Come on, quick. - Hey! Hey kid, come here, will you? - Hi there, Charuga. So, they put you behind bars too, huh? - Get me out of here. I can do you some favors too. Tisa, go to the magazine and get some explosives. - No. I can't get it to open, you're unlucky. (suspenseful music) - Go up there. You little bastard, what are you doing here? Huh? - Nothing. (grunting) - You leave the boy alone. - Come here. - Leave me alone! (grunting) Father! - I'll show you. - Father! (grunting) Stop beating me! (grunting) (gun firing) (suspenseful music) Major! (gun firing) - You all right, boy? - Yes. You are very brave, Major. Braver than my father. - Not as brave as your father, son. - Come on, Tisa. - What's going on? You changing the guard? - Why did they put you here? - I'm not much of a soldier. I prefer to do my fighting in bed. Don't you? - So you're Gavran's man, huh? Where is he? - I don't know where he is. - You're a big man now Gavran can't see you. - I don't care, but you can pass me a cigarette. Don't worry about him. He's only guarding the bridge. Hey American, you must be up to something. - What gives you that idea? - [Charuga] You were not playing patty cake just now, and neither are the partisans up there. - Now tell me, does Gavran trust your uncle? - Wouldn't you trust your own brother? - Not always. - These two do. But they're different. Gavran is a dirty skunk, a murderer, a vulture, and Yanko is treacherous, cunning, a double crosser. - Hmm. I'll get you some food. - I'd prefer it if you sent me Marta, or have you already booked her for yourself? - What? - I am only kidding. - Hey, man over there needs some food. - How about you, don't you eat? - Yeah, well, when I'm invited. - You are invited. - Well, that's nice, maybe later. - Wait for me here. - Okay. - I'll see you then. - Yeah, but what I'm really looking for isn't food. - [Marta] I don't know anything. (suspenseful music) (explosions booming) (yelling) (guns firing) - Be careful. Don't overload them. Not too many connections. I'm going to get a signal to the Major. (suspenseful music) - This was not bad. - [Major] Does Gavran feed you better? - Sometimes we have plenty to eat, but who cares only about that? - Why'd you join him? - I'll try anything once. Hey, how about letting me out of this dump? - Finish your food first. I wanna find the guy they call the Guitarist. - And I'm looking for wine, good food, girls. I don't know where your man is. - What else do you know? - It's better not to talk too much if you want to live a long time. - [Major] What do you mean? - That cook of yours is very talented. Hey, give me a break? - I will when I come back if you remember something about the Guitarist. - My memory is better when I'm free. If you open this door, I may be able to help you. - Are you waiting for someone? Major? Your life is in danger. Gavran's coming to town. - How do you know? - Tisa. Yanko disconnected our phone. - Who informed Gavran? - This is Gavran's territory. - You tell him? - What are you going to do? - I'm going to organize the people around this area to help me fight against Gavran. He won't terrorize anyone anymore. - Major, Gavran is coming because of you. So, you called him the Guitarist also? How did you know him? (gentle instrumental music) He won't be back, Major. He was killed. You better leave. The Guitarist is dead. Save yourself, Major. Yanko buried him up there on the hill. Maybe he did it for Tisa who liked to hear him play. - Who killed him, Marta? - I don't know. - Was it Yanko, Gavran? - You must find out for yourself. - Who was it, Marta? - Please don't ask me. (somber instrumental music) (gun firing) - Come on! Take this. I'll show him. I'll show them who is running things here. I'll show them who is boss. I'll kill them all. I'll kill them! Are there any more? Look, can you find more? If you find any, kill them. A live one, kill him, I say. Shoot them! Shoot them all. I shoot them, shoot them. I kill them. It's my bridge, do you hear me? My bridge, my mountain. This is my territory! I am Gavran! This is mine, my territory. Mine, mine! (suspenseful music) Come on! - No movement in the mountains, Gavran. - What about the Major? I'll get to him soon. Clean up the bridge! (suspenseful music) - Open the door. Anybody around? Hey, anybody home? - Go away, stranger. You will bring me trouble. - I thought you liked soldiers. I need some help. - What you need is my gun. What do you really want, Major? - I want to stop Gavran killing and looting in this area. - Nobody here is wishing to fight against Gavran. - Oh, we can if we fight together as men. - Huh, there is no men left in town. - There is one, old timer, me. - If he finds one to join, will you? - I hope he will leave town. - He won't leave until he finishes his work. - Isn't anybody here, hey? (dog barking) (suspenseful music) - What do you want? - I'm looking for some help. A trainload of Germans is coming through here. Do you know when? - No, I don't. - Gavran must be stopped. - That's Gavran's business. - What are you afraid of? Huh. - Gavran. (hooves clopping) - Look out. (chuckling) (suspenseful music) - Tisa. Take the horse to the stable. - No. - What? - No. (gentle instrumental music) (suspenseful music) (hooves clopping) (horse neighing) - Tisa. That Gavran's man? - Uhuh. - He come alone? - Uhuh. - Did you take care of the horse, Tisa? What do you want, Major? - Hmm, hey, you have good taste, Yanko. One of Gavran's men's in town. Why you taking care of his horse? - Horses are our friends. They don't fight in wars. - Well, in war, you don't know who your friends are. - Hmm, huh. How many people joined you in your fight against Gavran? - None. - Why don't you leave while you still have time? - Yanko, why do you cover up for Gavran's mistakes? He'll pay soon enough. Tisa will remember all this when he grows up. It'll influence what kind of man he is, or don't you care? - I like your type of people. I know what you mean, but I'm not going to help you. Gavran is my brother. What was he after? Your Guitarist. - He wanted a better world to live in. He was willing to die for it. - Why did he choose Uskoplje? (gentle instrumental music) - There was a rail man in this town, a friend of his at school. Would you know who that was? - I never went to school, Major. - I thought the switchman could be the one he used to know. I asked him and he denies it. Now, who killed him? - Tell me, Major, was the Guitarist your father? - Yanko, now you tell me if you know who killed him? - Did you ask the cripple? - [Major] Why him? - Why me? We didn't. - Doesn't work. - An hour ago it was broken. - Well, thanks for the drink. (sings in foreign language) - Stop, stop, stop here. Here is one. (sings in foreign language) Come on. (grunting) Come on. Come on, come on. Watch me, come on. Stop, stop here once more. (sings in foreign language) Come on, push me. Stop, stop here. (grunting) - Hey! (gun firing) (suspenseful music) - Major. Major? - You should be home in bed, boy. - My father thinks that you're not with us because of your accent. - Well, I grew up in America. - Why? - Well, my father knew there'd be trouble in this country, so he sent my mother and me away. - Why did you come back? To help our people? - To help your people. - They won't take your help. - They're my people. - But my father says it's dangerous. - I sure have got a feeling that you're right. (dog barking) Hey. - Gavran's men came here only to watch you. My father says if there's trouble in this village, the Germans will kill everyone. - Your father could be right. - Why don't you leave? - Everybody has to die, Tisa. Some people die being afraid to live. A lot of people die because they wanna live. - I don't understand. - (chuckles) You will someday. Go home, boy, before your father worries about you. - [Tisa] Good luck, Major. (gun firing) - Marta! - Come here. Where's his man? - I don't know. - I wish I was with Mateo. I know he's in trouble. - Tell me about the Guitarist. - He was one of us. The Guitarist was his code name. - Like Major is yours. Is it the only name you use? - Yeah. - You remind me of the Guitarist when you look at me. (gentle instrumental music) - Marta, when's the train coming? - Major, leave Uskoplje. It's not your business. - No, no, no, it's my job. Yeah, but Mateo might be-- - The train's already coming up the mountain. - That doesn't give me enough time to find my father's killer. (gentle instrumental music) - So it was your father? They will kill you too. - Heh, not if I can help it. Hey, no, you go back. Go on, go back there. Tisa. Do me a favor, boy. - Anything you want, Major. - Release Charuga. - But he's Gavran's man. - Maybe, maybe not. Go on, be careful. (suspenseful music) (gun firing) (bullets pinging) - Where did you get the key? - The Major gave me it. (guns firing) (suspenseful music) (explosion booming) - Thanks. - Thank you, Major. - Gavran's coming. I've gotta make sure that train doesn't stop here. - So you're with the partisans. - Uhuh. You've got a big decision to make. - Okay, chief. (lively instrumental music) - You cover me here, eh? (suspenseful music) (train whistling) (suspenseful music) (train chugging) (suspenseful music) (train chugging) (suspenseful music) - Chago, turn in the back. You others, with me. Go on. There he is. (guns firing) - Marta, stay away from him! - Major! (gun firing) (groaning) - I killed her. (suspenseful music) I don't care. It's your fault. Major, it's because of you that I did that, because of you, do you hear me? It was me that killed your father. I killed your father, did you hear? (laughing) No! (yelping) (gun firing) (groaning) - Yanko, signal the train to stop until I clean up this mess. - What about the Major? - [Gavran] My man is covering him. (train chugging) (train whistling) (suspenseful music) - Watch it, Major. (gun firing) (suspenseful music) - Tisa, keep down. (gun firing) - Tisa! (somber instrumental music) - Don't stop the train. - I won't. I won't, son. Gavran! (groaning) - [Gavran] Yanko, why? No! (gun fires) No! (groaning) - Die, Gavran, die! (groaning) (suspenseful music) (guns firing) (train chugging) (guns firing) (explosions booming) (train whistling) (guns firing) (gentle instrumental music) (suspenseful music) (train chugging) (train whistling) (explosion booming) (gentle instrumental music) (MultiCom Jingle)
