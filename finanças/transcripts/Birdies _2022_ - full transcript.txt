Pin on your diapers, Charlie, and hit that nail. There you have it, Charlie. Twin Pines is finally complete. And one day, all of this is gonna be yours. Don't fuck it up. Fore! Hola, Mr. Conroy! Buenos Dias, EÃ±ejo! Amigo, amigo. Boss, are you here yet? Son of a bitch! What? We need an exterminator. Just call the cheapest one you can find. No more than three stars. You also need someone that will generally run this club, and not just run it into the ground. Little harsh for 8:00 a.m. Fred. How's that morning latte, Conroy? Oh, it was going great until you fucked it up. So you'll black out five minutes later than usual? If I'm lucky. Perfect, I will update the schedule. Pop, phone. Pop, phone's ringing. What the hell do I pay you for? The phone's right behind you, you weirdo. Just answer it. Trust me. She wants the whole shaft. Roach Smokers. Yes, ma'am. And where is this at? Twin Pines Country Club. I'm gonna send my best man over there right now. Thank you very much. You hired someone new? Would you rather me lower their expectations? You could. Might set a better precedent. Turn the damn TV off and get your ass to work. You want this off? Helps you sleep. You relive your glory days on someone else's time. The only future you have in golf is at Twin Pines killing bugs. Ouch, that was so mean. Also, I've been hitting the driving range every Wednesday, thank you very much. Oh, does Brandy know about this? Oh God, no. Please don't tell her also that'd be a massive problem. Get your ass out here and make me some damn money. Okay, I love you so much. Hope you say it back someday. Yeah, I bet you do. Oh, not again. Ms. Gladys, you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Dehydrated. I'll send Emily over, stat. Gladys needs a little assistance by the ninth hole Tee. Copy? Copy that, on my way. 10-4. Emily's gonna bring you beer, Ms. Gladys. We're good. Fuckers. Shane, Jesus! What's up boss? Shainski had a big night, sex with a dude, again. It's called being experimental, Mikels, and dude was actually quite the gentleman... and pretty fucking sexy. Told you. You guys gonna clean this up? Hey, Linda! It's raining men, girl, let's go! Let's get some drinks! Charlie, we've gotta get this place together. Fred, honey, take it easy. Exterminator's on his way. Great, see if he'll cut us a deal. Yeah, how? Maybe he likes golf. Dixie Classic tournament... Ready to lose again? Won't be difficult. It's our year to host. A little patchwork on the greens. Call it good, and goodbye. And another thing. Fred, you are killing my buzz. Jarvis Boyd is the tournament director this year, and you know his inspections can be a bitch. He is not gonna give Charlie Conroy any breaks. Twin Pines is of course for normal people. I'll keep it that way. There's a new rule in the Dixie this year. Oh, more good news. Any club that hasn't won in a 15 year tournament cycle is out. Spell it out for me, Fred. We have to win the Dixie Classic. Or, hear me, say goodbye to this stupid tradition! It's a dumb name anyway, What year is it? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Morning, everyone! Connie! What's shaking? It's our year to host the Dixie, you need to get this place in shape. What was that? What. I think I just cut you off. I wasn't even speaking, Nick. Oh, oh. Good answer. I have an appointment. Another online date? Wrong, I met her on a dating app, I'm modernizing. Court your online hussies somewhere else. Liquor's free here. No, it's not - Nick, it's 9:00 a.m. That's true, it is 9:00 a.m., Conroy. She better show up sooner or I'm gonna start without her. Knock, knock. Your breakfast, sir. Hello? Shit, she came in the front. Hey, the tournament - get this place in shape, huh? I need you to go out there and talk to the exterminator. Is that a... That's where I cut you off. Ah, miss Darcy. Charlie Conroy! You're the exterminator? Yeah. Yeah! What's your name? Jake. Hey Jake, I'm Nick. Nice to meet you. Jake, do you ever get in the mind of a bug when you do your work? Nah, I usually just kill 'em. Right. So what's the damage? Well, it's roaches which I'm sure you saw. Some cultures in the Amazon believe roaches are premonition of death to the homeowner. Who do you think's gonna die, Jake? I mean, I don't really know you guys. Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I'll send the bill soon as possible. Just in case. How about club credit? Beverages included, of course. No, no, that's not possible. All right, well send the bill over, we'll take care of it, quick. Yeah, we take any major credit card. We're just a regular company. Man, we really like that club credit thing around here, but yeah, it's whatever, okay, what do you gotta do? All right, how about this? I'll give you a small discount for a bucket of balls at the driving range. You got a deal. But no one can find out about this. Nobody. If my girl finds out, she will literally cut my dick off. Sir, I know secrets men have died for. Good men, men of honor. Yeah, whatever, man. Just don't tell anybody. I mean, I don't know my name. I won't tell me. You just said it was Nick. So she says, come to the hotel and text me when you get there. I do. She says there's this card key underneath the mat, the side door, and there was. Opened the door... Didn't really know what to expect, but I saw it right away. The bathroom would be right there, but there was a, like a sheet completely covering the bathroom door. But there was a slit in the sheet. What are you talking about? Yes, sir, I'd like to make a return please. On an item number A2415. It's lube on the move. Yes, sir, I have two of those and I'd like return them both, please. There's Dogleg. Hey also, is this approved by FDA? No? So you still don't know what she looks like? Not a clue. You guys gotta keep hanging out, or? - I hope so, man. Think it'll be something serious? I doubt it could possibly be. By the way, it's... Damn! Fuck you man. Yeah man, thanks for letting me do this. Oh, it's my pleasure. Thanks for listening to my story. Mom didn't like it. Holy shit. Man, you're pretty good. I'm gonna come up there and kick your ass, dude! Yeah, I used to play. Used to? Yeah, girlfriend. Ah, right. No, the blow-up-doll was fine. We just wish it was a girl not a guy. But it's fine, my wife loves him- You must have a huge dick! - Oh, not you sir. Do we like this guy? I don't even know that guy. I've gotta... What's the flattest iron you're having there? We got a two! You have a two iron? Oh yeah. For real? Wow, look at that. Get it. That'll work. Oh man, I can't wait to see this shit. What is this, a family heirloom? Nah, I don't have any family. Goddamn dude. Holy shit. Wow. I will be right back, sir. All right. So, what are the rules on the participants for the tournament? Employees and members, even I know that. This guy. You know, we're still looking for a club for pro, right? Pro, what happened to Harvey? Oh, he's dead. What? How, when? A couple years, I have no idea really? My word. Fuck you man. Damn you. Ah, fuck dude. My balls everywhere! Oh man. What the heck dude. Fuck man. Fuck you, man. What? No, I'll call you back. Good? Fuck you! I can't hear you. I'm Jake. Jake! Hey, that was pretty incredible on the range there. Oh, thanks man. I'm Charlie Conroy, I own all this. Oh, Jake Baxter. Nice to meet you. How much you make killing bugs, Jake? Not a ton. Oh, go ahead. What's up, Pop. Where in the hell have you been? Janice Wieman has called three times! I know, yes, I'm on it. You've been outta- I'm on it Pop. -fuckin around on the golf course - I'm hanging up. Goodbye. [Pop} Piece of shit. Work for me. What's that? I want you to be my golf pro. You serious? You got quite a reputation, you know that? I remember you from your college days. Oh yeah, my college days. Criminal, dropout, golf phenom... You'll fit right in man. What do you guys even pay? Double. Of half your current pay, 10% increase, of course. Yeah, that's a really shitty deal. Sorry. Shit's also a fertilizer, Jake, plus you're an exterminator, so... You get a raise to have a cool job. Why don't you show up tomorrow morning, 9:00 a.m. Anything else Nick? Well, I mean you get free buckets of balls. The world's yours, buddy. Yeah, I can't, I'm sorry. That would be a huge problem with my girlfriend. She should be happy if you're happy, Jake. And if not just dump her ass. I can't, she's rich and beautiful, so. I'm sure she's understanding. And rich and beautiful? No. How does she feel about your current employment? It's literally anything but golf is allowed. Really? That's kind of where I right now. Jesus. I'm sorry. Yes Pop, I'm just finishing up over here. It's okay Jake, you're fired. Hello? I just got fired. See you tomorrow morning. 9:00 a.m. Oh, goddamn it. Well gentlemen, welcome to the quarterly board meeting of the Magnolia Pointe Country Club. Our first order of business today is to revoke the membership of Mr. Gerald Schilner. It seems his financials are not in line with this club's requirements. And his car's five years old for heaven sakes. And it's hunter green. Poor people, ew. Zip it, you twats! Daddy. Anything else? Yeah, I just talked to Darcy Dobbins. It seems Twin Pines has hired a new golf pro. Did they? Yes, sir, Mr. Boyd. An exterminator... Jake Baxter. JAKE BAXTER!? Yeah, we are familiar. He was on my golf team in college. He got kicked out for selling drugs. Is he any good? He beat Adrian a few times. I was injured. Okay, then what? Then he became a loser exterminator, genius. Duh. Not anymore. Clean your ugly face, ugly person. Oh burn. Fuck you Thomas. - Fuck you. So what exactly do we need to know about this Baxter guy? I said, what do we need to know about this Baxter guy? Brandy? The fuck! Where have you been? Fuck it, I was working late. There's a bunch of bugs- I'll ask you again. Where the fuck have you been? I cooked. I cheated on you. I was out having sex with someone, my secretary. You don't have a secretary. A secretary, and she was so hot, too. And she was a doctor secretary, and she was a doctor, too. Son of a bitch. It was just sticking outta my pocket, wasn't it? Classic Baxter. Pop fired you and now you're playing golf. Babe, it was just the driving range. It wasn't even fun. It was stupid-Same thing. Well, it's not the same thing, baby. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. But I have news, I have really good news. You ready? So you know how you've always been saying I should quit Roach Smokers, get a real job. Yeah, but you didn't quit, you got fired. Yeah, that part took care of itself. But the cool part is I got a new job. Who would hire you? Twin Pines. Conroy's old club? Yeah. And what are you doing at Twin Pines? I don't know. We-we didn't really talk about it. I think I'm the new club pro. That's it. Babe, it pays more and it's something I actually enjoy. Like we need money. I'm not gonna keep living off your dad's money for the rest of my life. What the fuck is that? Is that new? There's a new man in town. Good God. So you just need to get out of my house. Brandy. Now. Fuck! Like now. Are you seriously hitting me? Like for real. Okay, Brandy! Like, get out. - If I did that to you- Now, get out. - It'd be a whole thing on the news. Brandy! Please don't use that thing without me that will ruin my confidence, Brandy, please. Can I at least have my keys? Brandy. Excuse me. Sorry. Shut the fuck up man! We're trying to surprise someone. Who are we surprising? You're still talking? I'm sorry, man. Dude, we got a new golf pro. Just go and spray or whatever you do, bro. You're gonna laugh, but I think I'm the new golf pro. Unless you hired more than one. What? I'm Jake. I met Conroy yesterday, and Nick. Fucking surprise bro. Hey Jake! Someone unjammed the back door, that's awesome. Whoa. We love surprises around here. We just love 'em. We're not good at 'em but- No, no, I was surprised. Yeah, hey, grab some candy if you want. I'm good for now. Okay, okay. Yeah, we already got into that piÃ±ata. I mean it's a piÃ±ata, yeah. Hey, this is the Twin Pines crew. How's it going everybody? Yeah, look at that. Thank you for this. Jake... uh, Baxter. Yeah, our head greensman, EÃ±ejo. Hey, aloha amigo. Aloha. Hey, pacha-mama of the Aztec nation welcomes you. Yeah, pacha-mama uh back at you. Tell her, I said hello. Goes to Peru one week, changes him forever. That's where we met actually. Follow me. This is Fred, she's our badass bartender. Fred, is it? Fred. As in like... Fred. Your name is Fred. We got Shainski, Mikels. I would avoid them if you could. You're late to the party, bro. That's okay, Jake's running late too. Are they good? No, they're not. All right, here we have Emily. She drives the beer cart. And her sister as hot as hell and doesn't think that I am. Bummer. Yeah. Hi Jake. How's it going? Your expertise is a welcome change. Hopefully you work out better than the last head pro. He died. Yeah. Did he really die? Oh yeah, he died real hard. Oh. Last and very least, we have Dogleg. He drives the picker cart, which you demolished, but he also runs the pro shop and you could use some new threads. So go ahead and do your thing Leg. I say a medium shirt, 32 by 30 pants. A little loose on the trousers there. Yeah, actually dead on. You hit my cart again, I'll rip those nuts off. Cool. Sorry, I didn't know I would like meet you in person. Okay, beer. I'm good, thank you. Little early, don't you think? It's like 9:00 a.m. Okay. Thank you, thank you for saying that. I think we started around 7:00, right? 6:00? 6:30. Maybe 6:30. El YESTARDA Enejo hasn't stopped. Really? Yeah. So you guys all just drink as soon as the day starts. Welcome to hell. Right on, cool. So who's all like running things? Back to work, everyone! Gotcha! We so got him. Yeah, this place pretty much runs itself. We're fine. It does? Yeah. I don't know. I do... and you do too. Hey, let me show you your office. I have an office. Fuck yeah, you have an office. Oh yeah, sure. Show me the office. Follow me. All right. Excuse me. Sorry. Yep, here we go. Oh, is this it? Yeah. Oh, okay. Yeah. I thought you said, I got an office. I don't think I said that. Now get back there, feel it out. Sure. No, yeah, this is nice. Yeah, it is. Yeah, this is... A desk. Yeah, this is plenty. Agreed, agreed. Oops. It's all right. Oh my God. That. Can't waste that. Yeah. So just to be clear, what exactly is my job supposed to be? You know, go out to the range and practice, participate in our annual tournament. Glad-hand the members and the guests. Club pro shit. Wait, I have to play in a tournament? Yeah, it's not a big deal, it'll be fun. There's no pressure, we never win. Okay, I haven't played golf in like seven years. Well, I appreciate your modesty. What is that? What? Is that a hickey? It's definitely not a hickey. I haven't had a hickey in a really long time. You dog, let's get you outta those clothes. Is there something on my neck, Nick? Nick, my neck? All right, so this is where you'll be schmoozing with the guests, the members, the drunk golfers, giving 'em tips and tricks and stuff like that. Let's do a shot. I'm good, thank you. All right. You are spilling that. All over the bar, sure. Great. All right, there you go. I said no, thank you. I'll take both. Jake, I'm sure no one's told you. So let me be the first. We're not gonna make it to next quarter. Fred, easy, it's his first day. Welcome Jake. Where's your glass? I actually don't drink. What? If I have one drink, then within the hour, I'll be out on that fairway naked smoking meth. It's like a whole problem, people will hate me. People would love you. Whoa, whoa, whoa, do not try to corrupt our new golf pro. The hell is wrong with you two. Fred is right. It's actually kind of perfect. Not only do we need to fix this place up, but we need to win that prize money. And if Jake is sober, God help him, maybe that will improve our chances. I'm glad you think that's funny. Now who besides the three of us here can actually play golf? Well, we got me. One. You. Two. There's this guy. Now three. Yeah, you're right. We need one more. Conroy, we have to win the tournament this year. Have we ever won the tournament? Yeah. A long time ago. My dad started the Dixie when he built this club, I can't get us kicked out of it. Besides we need that fucking prize money. We can do countless things. We could do like a yard sale of some sort. We could do a car, like a sexy car wash. Something, I don't know. We could strip down and get some... - I'm not doing a car wash. I don't know, I'm just riffing. We lose the tournament, we lose the money, we lose the club, we lose our jobs. I'm losing my buzz. Anyone wanna shot? Deal me in. Jake? No, I'm still sober. So Conroy, do I have to play against other like, club pros? Relax, it's captain's choice. Best ball wins each stroke. No, no, that's the whole thing. That's what I was telling you, I can't. My girlfriend. Look, who is this girl? Why does she hate golf? Jake, many psychologists affirm that malicious feelings toward a significant others' key interest is very, very toxic. Psychologists don't even know my girlfriend. We're fine, we're in love. I like her a lot and we're happy. When I was in college, on the golf team, I used to get in a lot of trouble and her whole family kinda hates me. Yeah. So shots? No, I don't drink. I permanently don't drink. Okay. At all. All right. I get it. Well, it's just been a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Al-Asmari Sarah, the pleasure's all mine. Thank you so much. Your application has been submitted, so I hope I get to call you in a couple of weeks with the good news. Well, I'm excited, Sarah. I've been looking forward to playing this place a long time. Oh, it's the my pleasure. Yes, you have a great day. I'll see you soon. Yeah, you too. Okay. Relax, Sarah. Oh, I was... No, I thought I would just drop by and see how you were doing. I am doing fine. You know that applicant that was just in here a little while ago. Yes. He seemed a little, what's the word? Unconventional, non-traditional, different. Sure. All business aside, that offer for that second drink still stands. Oh, yeah. Oh, you know, I am just really exhausted. The end of a long day, you know? But thank you. We'll take this up at a different time. All right everybody, listen up. I got an announcement to make. We've got the Dixie tournament coming up and short story shorter, we have to win. So we are getting our shit together, okay. The team is gonna be Jake, Nick and myself, which means only one of you needs to learn how to play golf. Who's the best here at Twin Pines? Yeah, who sucks the least? That'd be Shane when he's sober, but one sip of booze, he's fucked. Harsh dude. It's true. Jake, all I know is that you gotta beat that douche at Magnolia Pointe. Yeah, I am aware. Thank you, Emily. Yeah, Adrian Boyd has not lost in seven years. Still the biggest douchebag in seven kingdoms. Am I? Is he? Oh Christ. Jake fucking Baxter. I haven't seen you since you were being a loser, letting everyone down. Shouldn't you be somewhere spraying cockroaches? You know this prick? Yeah, for sure. Believe it or not, this tiny little boy is my future brother-in-law, can't wait. Maybe you people haven't realized this, but your new golf pro is a convicted felon, an alcoholic and a drug addict. Yeah. Yeah! Don't cheer, don't cheer. I'm sober now, seven years. I keep telling you guys. Thank you. Baxter, you deserve to be in this dump. Jesus! What color is your ceiling? Cancer? What's with this homeless guy? Fuck you. The fuck do you want? Just trying to grab some beers, man. Catch the scenery. Trying to figure out what happened to this shithole. Hey sweetie, how about three beers, stat. Wow. How about no. All right, I'm sorry, but her name's Fred. Fred? Yeah. Oh, I'll call your name out later, baby. Fred, Fred. It's a guy's name. Oh Jesus. Hey, watch it bro, I'll sue your ass. Hold me back, man. Hey man, you're lucky they're holding me back, bro. Slow down fucker. Shitty bar anyway. I think it's time for you to go. This place makes my eyes want to kill themselves. Let's go. Wait. Hey Jake. What? Don't you wanna know what my handicap is these days? Your personality? Impotence? Oh my God. You think you can beat me. Oh my God. That is so adorable. I just wanna pinch you. I do! You know what, I do. It wouldn't be anything new, would it? That was seven years ago, man. Conroy, is this little asshole the only competition we have? I promise you Baxter, I am a huge asshole. Huge. Gaping. When he poots, it goes whoooo. Wind tunnel. Why are you bragging about that? Watch your shit, Baxter. Yeah, I'll watch my shit, bro. I'll watch my shit drop on your face. Yeah gross, I'm sorry. I don't usually say stuff like that. I don't know what to say to that. Come on. Later nerds. Hey guys, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! Wow, fuck. A bit of a scene, huh? I'm sorry about that everybody. I have kind of a history with that guy. You just gotta externalize him, man. I mean this whole experience is a result of our ego. So just absorb that negativity, turn it into something good. After the tournament. What was that dude? Was that like special ops or Navy Seal or what? I was mall security for a while. Can I get a shot, please? Dangerous mall. Yeah, you actually deserve this one. Hey, you know what, can I borrow that club up there real quick? I got an idea. Go ahead. Perfect. Can you come with me though just 'cause you can, that kick that you can do. Those chicks upstairs were jocking you so hard, bro. Of course they were. Get in the car. Fuck, fuck, fuck. There's no fucking way I'm letting that guy steal my thunder. Oh hell no. Your thunder is so unstealable A. money. Right? Yeah. Oh Jesus Christ. Are you okay? I don't know, you guys okay? Fore. Nobody fucks with Seabiscuit! Oh, he's coming, man. Get in the car man. Go, go, go, man. See you in court! Take care. Oh my God, man. This place rules, man. Jake, I cannot wait to see how you perform in competition. Yeah, me too. See how it goes. So what happened in college? Yeah, yeah, that was kind of an ordeal. 10 hookers from just like the yellow pages. I think that was the worst part, was the hookers. But then also a pound of weed, half a gallon of jack. 133 beers, I think they counted, and ounce of coke. And then some molly and then some guy brought ketamine. I had never done ketamine. So we did that and then poppers and then half a tab of acid. This is after I won state junior year. That sounds like a great week. This was one night. How'd she find out? That was my fault. I invited her into bed with us and then she knew right then and there. And how is she handling all this? Not great. She locked me out last night. I slept in the rain. So that's couple stuff. You're together seven years, you kinda, you sleep in the rain sometimes. We'll talk about it at dinner. So back to this whole you not playing golf for the last seven years. Can we get you back out for another round or five tomorrow. And then every other day leading up to the tournament? We've got two weeks to practice. Jake, historically, we've not had the best relationship with the members at Magnolia Pointe. Or the management. Boss fucked Jarvis's wife. His ex-wife. Because you fucked her. You fucked Jarvis's wife? Oh my God, dude. Is that why they got divorced? You know the rumors that he's in the closet and that's why they got divorced. Oh, he's deep in the closet. Damn dude, that's cool. I think that's really cool. Sick dude. How's Adrian's game looking these days? I said how's Adrian's game these days? Let me get this for you, sir. You got a little something on your shirt. What? Something on your shirt. - hat the hell? What is this? Did you do this? I did not. Get the hell out, you're fired. Oh right. Get outta here. Night fellas. See you later, man. Good first day, Jake. Thank you, sir. You good to drive? Yeah, I got my license. Hey! Hey. You live there? Yeah. Why do you drive? Well, I was over there, but I live here. Fair enough. Oof. Hey honey. Hey gummy bear. How was your first day? Ah, it was whatever. You know, it's one of those... Not great, huh? I guess you're just stuck with it. Yeah. Can't go back to Roach Smokers. I can't, it's so stupid, it sucks. I have to like golf now. Fuck. If you quit, you have sex again. Man, yes. Kind of starting to forget what that feels like. Is that something we could maybe discuss, or? I don't think so. Still no. That's fair. What's for dinner? We have a roasted bird with brown rice and asparagus. Sounds good. Nope. Jesus Christ Brandy. You're torturing me at this point. You don't have to wear that to bed. It's just comfy. Fucking God. Brandy, I need you. Then you need to find another job. Brandy, you can't keep blaming golf for all the things that happened to us in college. I'm sorry us. And by that, do you mean the hookers and drugs? That we did? Oh my God, here we go. If I can't blame golf then who can I blame? Everything's been fine since then and now look at you. No sex because golf. Fine. Whatever. Oh yeah. Wow. Oh, yeah! Oh, this is better. I like this better! All right folks, balls teed up! Tee up those balls. Fred, keep your head down. Dogleg, I would say probably just no, you can probably go pick up those balls. Gladys, I noticed a slice. Shainski, I know you wanna have a wide stance 'cause you're so drunk and it's hard to stand up. But if you narrow that stance, you can get more rotation through the hips, all right? Mikels bend those knees, tighten up a little bit, but stay relaxed. EÃ±ejo, are those gardening gloves? Emily, that was fucking hot. That was good, the swing was good. I've been working here for five years. I don't know what they've been doing. Okay everyone, if your ball did not go past the 100 yard marker, you have officially been cut. But don't get it twisted, you have not been cut off. Go ahead and feel free to make your way back to the clubhouse, put some liquids into your face holes. Have fun. Yeah. Hey you two, threesome? Come on. Hey, wait for me Gladys. Oh shit snake, man. Snake! Meet Sir Hissyfit. Oh, come on Shainski, it was a joke, bro. I got it all on video, I'm posting right now. You fucking pussy. Hi. Hey, what are you doing? Just working away. Looking at Match Strike? Yeah, okay. Fine, yeah, I am. But unsuccessfully. You'll find someone. Hmm, sexy mama. How about, a drink? Yeah, someone equally as desperate as I am. Charlie Conroy just messaged me. That crazy guy that owns Twin Pines? I haven't even said one word to this guy and he wants to meet for a drink. He's desperate. You're desperate too. Talk to you later. Hi. How are you, Charlie? Much better now that I am looking at your... How about dinner? I think so. I'll hold off on that. A cocktail and a bite. No strings attached. Your putt looks like shit dude. Yeah. Got any pointers? See, your mechanics are off. Let's see. Discomfort in your right hip. Yeah, how'd you know? I mean it's pretty fucking obvious. Putting all your weight on the left side. You're overcompensating. I've been to like a thousand doctor since college and no one can diagnose it. I can help you. Can you? Oh yeah. How. Huachuma ceremony. Pardon? It's an ancient shamanic medicine from the sacred cactus. Also known as San Pedro. Nick, are you a shaman? Oh God, no. For we are all our own shaman, Jake. Oh we are? The medicine will teach you. It'll show you where the pain is so you can extract it. The grandfather is very wise. Your grandfather? No, no, no, he's an idiot. The cactus, grandfather Huachuma. Cut and cooked right here at Twin Pines. Really? Oh yeah. So how long have you been on Match Strike? It was my daughter's idea, I just... Can I get you anything to drink? A cocktail? No thank you, just water for me. Two martinis. No, no, just one, I'm not drinking. They're for me. I took a nap, I just gotta get back up to speed. Oh shit. Now what? That's my boss, he comes here all the time. Well, no worries, let's chat with him. Oh this fucking dickhead? Sarah, you look beautiful. Thank you. Charlie Conroy. Are you sober tonight, Charlie? Dickhead, Jarvis. I know you're gonna date other men, that's fine. But this individual just is not in your class. The fuck did you just say? Hey, watch your language. This is not Twin Pines. You're gonna apologize after I've taken my foot outta your asshole. You're right, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Conroy, that you're such a loser. Your daddy would be so ashamed of you. Yeah, care put a little wager on that? I would, but I don't think you can afford it. I'll bet you 25 grand on the Dixie that I've got better golfers and people than all those pricks at Magnolia Pointe. I don't care what type of shape Twin Pines is in. We know that for a fact. We have more integrity in one blade of grass than you've got in that whole generic piece of shit club of yours. Well, let's put up a little wager. Let's put up our clubs. You'd put your club up in a bet against me? This is childish. Name the terms. Oh simple. My club against your club. Winner take all. Bet your life. You bet yours. Charlie! Oh, you faker, look at this. He's trying to back out the bet. Someone call an ambulance! I think is having a heart attack. I'll see you at work, Sarah. It's okay. Hey, can you grab me a bottle of whiskey? Nope, but I'll have something better for you on the ride. My man. He was just talking to someone and then he grabbed at his chest and I've seen a heart attack before, so yeah. Well thank you, ma'am. Would you like to ride with your husband? I'll meet him there later. He should be okay. Good thing he has you. Good morning, Charles, I'm Dr. Lloyd. How you feeling buddy? I've been better. Well, you're pretty lucky that your friend knew what was going on, because you have suffered a mild heart attack. Yeah, I've been lucky doc and this ain't it. How many drinks a week would you say you consume? Not that many. Well, according to your chart, your blood alcohol level is currently 0.21, that's high. Is it? That's after eight hours. Yeah, that's a little bit high. So we'd really like to keep you one more night, send you to the cath lab in the morning and run a few tests. What do you think? Yeah, sure. But Charles I highly recommend some extreme lifestyle changes. Okay, so what are we talking about? Get sober. That's a little drastic. I'll be back in a couple hours of check on you, buddy. All right. Dammit, Conroy. Enough, just talk to me. All right. Well, if you don't get well soon, you're gonna lose everything you have. Also, Nick's looking for a job. Jake's actually really good for the place. And he likes it here. Do they know about me yet? Yeah, they wanna come see you. No and don't tell anyone else. If I'm gonna play in the Dixie, I'm gonna get- Well, if you wanna plan the Dixie, do you think you should? Yeah. But Conroy, you just- Dammit Fred, I should be dead right now and the only person that has come to see me is my bartender. Where all the friends I used to have? What friends? I don't fucking know. I got no one. My dad built Twin Pines and I can't lose it. Don't worry about the club, okay. We'll figure all that out. When do we get you back then? They'll let me out tomorrow. Did you bring my phone? Of course. You're gonna look at porn in this, aren't you? Yes. Get well, Conroy. Grandma goes wild... hmmm. Oh morning buddy. Everything's great. That's close. Okay. Complimentary club day. Hey, what are you doing? Have a good round. Hey, listen, we need to find a replacement for Conroy in the tournament. We need to fix your putt. No, we don't need to fix, my putt's good man. Well we do, we need to drink the juice too. The cactus juice. I'm not drinking the juice. Conroy just had a heart attack. We gotta drink the cactus, Jakey Bear! Just get in the cart, you're freaking people out. I'm not drinking the cactus, man. We're not doing hallucinogenics. Channel your energy into fixing your hip and to healing Conroy's heart. We'll figure it out, just get outta here. Sorry dude, I think you pretty much got it. Nothing I can really tell you about putting. You just gotta aim for the hole! You were doing it, just continue to do it! Hola brother, Jake. How's it going EÃ±ejo? Pacha-mama welcomes you here today. I bet she does, what is this? This is Twin Pine source of spiritual energy, Jake. It's also a very viable source of supplementary income. Formally the 10th fairway. What do you mean supplementary income? Oh, we sell them on the internet. It's a house plant. Oh my God, seriously? Yeah. Myself and EÃ±ejo will be back shortly. Reset your mind. Put into focus what you'd like to work on today. I was working on my putt, I thought. Okay, that's exactly what we're doing. Except we're going to be doing it with your... My hat. Your... Oh, my memory. Your ma... Mom. Not your mom, no, your m-mi- Oh my mind? Mind. Oh fuck. Yeah, sure. Why didn't you just say that? I don't know. But we'll see you soon. Fuck. Oh man. Is this like a whole weird thing? I'm not gonna do a whole weird thing. I don't wanna be culturally insensitive. Friends today, we connect with the ancient ones. Not by looking up, but by looking in. We will be extracting our past and healing our present. One thing we must remember in is that there is no past, there is no future. There is only now. Now is forever, and now is never. Jake, you're experiencing some blockage in your hip. Your right hip. This is my right hip. A fear of moving forward. You're exactly right. Something or someone is preventing Jake from moving forward. We will be awake today, Jake and perhaps the ancient ones will be able to channel even more energy through your hickey. I don't have a hickey. Hickeyawaiku. Hickeyawaiku. Drink this medicina for it as a gift from the pacha-mama. Oh man. I thought it was gonna be good. It's foolish to think that. Hickeyawaiku. Hondacord. Veolvo. Okay. What now? Now we wait. Feel free to wander about with your thoughts and your feelings. Let go. Hickeyawaiku. Hickeyawaiku. Hickeyawaiku. Veolvo. Hickeyawaiku. Hickeyawaiku. Neesonn. Altima. The ceremony has begun. Here, have another. What the hell? Idiots. What did it say? Wow! Sir. What's up? That cart just blew past me like a bat outta hell. He must have been doing 50 miles power. Don't you have any regulations? No, sir. Here at Twin Pines, you can drive as fast as you like. And I personally took the governor off each and every one of these carts so you can knock out 18 holes in less than two hours. Hell, our sales grew up 33%. You have a nice day. Cocktail? I don't think so. This place is a joke, daddy. Is this a parking lot or a pasture? Come on. Looks like Coachella. Hey, what is that? A pro shop? I think so. Hey dad, it's a pro shop. Can we get two tickets for golf please? Who would actually pay to come here? I feel like I'm gonna get robbed. I've never seen anything like it. Is that a fucking crater? Where are we? I don't know. This place is pathetic. It's terrible. What a joke. What the hell is this? How do we get across? I don't know. Maybe we can screen from the trees. This is so shitty, I feel bad for the tractor. I can't wait to watch them fail. You losers. Oh my God. Golf isn't the problem. Feeling okay, buddy? I need to find Brandy. Hey, honeysuckle brother. I'm telling you, bro. I was like a lion dude all night, bro. Just pounding ass. Oh yeah, what was his name? I'm not gay, brother. You are gay, dude. I'm pansexual. What does that mean? Like you have sex with cookware? Ah, really, you thought I'd fall for that again, dude? What? Hey, hey, get this on video. Let's see if Sir Hissyfit likes a fat in his face. Shainski, that's not Sir Hissyfit. What? Shainski, no. What do I have to do bro? What do I do? Oh dude, you have to suck the poison out. What? Suck it bro, I'm gonna die. Suck my butt, dude. Suck my butt. Help, snake bite, snake bite. Listen, dude, if you love me, you'll do it bro. Please, please suck my butt. Suck my butt. Oh that's what's up? Yeah. Fuck yeah, brother. Oh baby. Oh my God, yes. Hey bro, I will never ever forget this dude. You better forget this! Don't stop dude, don't stop! Oh, I fucking love you, dude. Oh my God. Wrong way buddy. Huh? Wrong way, buddy. Let's get you back to the clubhouse for some soup. It's time for integration. Shit, mi familia! What are you doin- Oops, sorry. You see my penis? Mr. Boyd, you are breaking into a million tiny pieces right now. It rules. Well, don't you fit in here just fine. I think so, I like it. And Nick says there's soup. It's super! No thank you. No? Okay, soup yourself. Wait till my sister finds out about this. You loser! Oh, fuck, Brandy. I think I got it all bro. I love you, bro. I fucking love you, bro. You saved my life. Bitch, you saved my life! This snake's not poisonous. What? It's not poisonous. I mean the bite might hurt a little bit, but you'll be fine. You're gonna fucking die, bro! Jake, great work today, man. Real breakthrough. And I know, I know, I know. You can't wait for tomorrow's ceremony. We'll do this again. No, I'm never doing this again, man. Oh-okie dokie, you get some good sleep. Yeah, goodnight. All right, cheers. Gummy bear, you home? Brandy. Brandy. Hey, can we talk? Did you quit, baby? Oh no, no I can't. I'm going to sleep. No, wait, no. We need to talk about college. No, why? Because I had an epiphany. You know, you've been blaming golf for all of our problems. It's not golf. What do you mean? Why? It's me, it's always been me. I fucked up. I cheated on you, Brandy. Fuck, how can you trust me? I don't deserve you. I'm stupid. What is wrong with you? Are you on drugs? No. Am I on drugs? Yeah, yeah, a little bit, but it's just like a cactus. It's not what you think. It's a cactus and you chop it up and you boil it. And you have to sit in a tent and you have to drink this. And when you wake up, everything is a million pieces and then you... What were we talking about? You're just saying all this 'cause you're fucked up. No, it's not. I'm not fucked up, I was. You should have seen me before. This is all happening again because of golf, Jake. No, it's not because of golf. I realized the problem this time, it's me. I fucked up, but I understand it now. Just get the fuck out. What? Don't come back. Are you serious? Yeah. Just get the fuck out. Hey there, you Conroy? Yeah, Rodney? Yeah, that's me. Come on in. How you doing today, where are we headed? Straight to hell, my man. But drop me off the Twin Pines first. You got it, need to pick up some weed anyway. Oh, I gotta take a shit. Hey, are you okay? Yeah Ms. Gladys, never better. I feel like a million bucks. Beer? I really shouldn't. Okay fella. Charlie Conroy, you are cut off. I was seriously just getting ready to give that back to her. Gladys, do you want this? Knock yourself out. Inside, now. They're coming, they're coming. Surprise!! We did it, we did it! We did it. Oh, welcome back chief. Great job not dying. Jesus Christ, what is wrong with you? We waited so long for you so long. Okay, let's get this party started. Go ahead Fred, load us up. He doesn't drink anymore, he just got out of the hospital, Nick. Actually, Nick, I can't. The doctor says I need to give the ticker time to catch up. I have to stay away from booze for a bit. Great story bro. Here you go. No, no, I can't. Here's to the boss. Long with the chief. Long live the chief. Hey, back to work, everyone. Let's go back to work. We did it, we got him! We got him good. Let's get an inventory. Catch me up on the state of the club. The golf club is operating marginally, sir, with as many underpaid and under-qualified employees as this mediocre town can provide within budget, of course. Like I said, this machine is pretty much running itself, I can say proudly. The bar is fully stocked as usual. But since you're absence, we actually have a surplus. Yeah, EÃ±ejo just finished all the new signage and all the greens and fairways are in top condition. That's obviously, that's not true, but seems like you need good news. Great work. Now let's talk tournament. How's everybody looking, everybody playing okay? You're not playing. What do you mean? You just got outta the hospital, you are not playing. Yeah, man, everyone knows about the heart attack. Also the bet, everyone knows about the bet. That was ill advised. Look, I need to go practice so that you all can keep your jobs. I need a tee time. Oh, yes sir. Dogleg, we got a tee time for boss man step. We're all clear, there's no one here today. Oh, okay, thank you so much. Conroy, you're not playing. Not listening to you and we will reconvene later. Does anyone listen to me around here? He's acting strange, no? Maybe he had like a bad dream or something. Yeah, yeah. Dude, are you trying to kill me. Are you worried about that bet with Jarvis? You've been looking at other jobs? Right. I told Fred that to motivate you, man. Hell, if I had kids, them and their kids would owe you for my bar tab. You kidding? Twin Pines is losing steam though. With that attitude. Well, I just don't know where we went wrong. Me neither. Is there anyone at this club that knows how to play golf? I mean, you've seen all we got. Shainski might jump in for you. Okay. What the fuck am I gonna do? Probably lose the bet. This is good for the heart, right? Well, I don't understand what God's done to me. 'cause I'm short in the britches and long off the tee... I've hit every fairway since I've been alive... But Jesus won't give me no sexual drive. Well I've got lots of balls and I'm always in clubs. And I've hooked up with skinnies and crazies and chubs... I've dated some ladies that were awful fun... But I ain't never got to the hole-in-one. What the fuck are we gonna do about Shane? Yeah, that was pretty bad. How you doing? Hello sir. Come on here, let's grab a seat. You want a drink or something? Yeah! Okay, so you're bit all over the place out there and we really need to win this tournament otherwise we're history. Tournament? Right. Everyone, I'd like to introduce you to Khalil, our newest member and scratch golfer. Is he now? Would you maybe be interested in playing in this little tournament we got coming up? We got an extra spot and sure wanna beat the shit out of Magnolia Pointe. Fuck yeah man. Yes. I like your enthusiasm. Really? Oh yeah. That's fucking-10 seconds ago, we were just talking about how screwed we were. Hell yeah, dude. There we go, dream team, done. Well, as my dad used to say, a birdie marks anything of excellence, and you guys, y'all are my birdies. Right, since we aren't drinking. Cheers to that. Oh cheers. Cheers. Cheers. Cheers to that. Yeah, cheers bro. Welcome! All right, let's fucking get to work. Get to work. Let's go with these guys. We're gonna kick their ass. Cheers, cheers. Okie, dokie, all right, Nick. Right, right, right. Cardinals chirping in the Pines. Wind whisping through the Bermuda grass. Alligators nipping at our heels. It's that time of year again, folks. Welcome to the 30th annual, Dixie invitational captain's choice golf tournament on this beautiful day at Twin Pines golf course. Is that local news? Yeah, Jarvis is trying to make a big deal out of this. Marvin Gleeman. Marvin! I did blow with him once. Just once? So many times. Welcome to another Dixie invitational at Twin Pines. Today, the big focus is Adrian Boyd, the five times champion team captain and on the other end, Jake Baxter, Charlie Conroy's new club pro here at Twin Pines. Now we hear- Oh shit. A slight rivalry brewing between these two clubs. What are Jake Baxter's chances, John, and what does his competition look like this year? These guys from Twin Pines who are calling themselves The Birdies will make anything but that. And they have as much chance as a preacher's daughter in Vegas. - Well, strong words, John, strong words. But that's right. But Baxter had a promising future before he mysteriously vanished from the landscape of amateur golf amids personal troubles over 10 years ago. Today he looks for redemption as he plays against his former teammate, Adrian Boyd, the tenured pro from Magnolia Pointe. - That's right and they have a surprise entrant. International legend, the pro golfer, John Nightly. - Whoa. Baby, what do you want from a man?! His great aunt was a member of Magnolia Pointe, did you know that? - I did not know that. - Come on, Boyd, we got this. Not today, bitch. Oh I can't wait to hit this! Ooh, shimmy, shimmy. So you can't play now. Just playing by your rules. Oh, whoopsie. Hi. Hello. How are things? Not here. Whoo! Smashed potatoes! - And that's the first shot at the Dixie Classic, the tournament of marginal playing, and culturally insensitive verbiage. All right! That's right next up, we have captain Adrian Boyd for team protein from Magnolia Pointe. Are these guys for real? - Look, I don't know anything about these fucking hicks. So just stick to the script, you Irish twat. Adrian Boyd. This douchebag has never seen a real day of work in his life and his hands. Well, they are softer than a newborn's ass. Let's see what he does. Whoa, what a shot and we are underway folks. HADOUKEN! - Oh God, that's gross. Pretty dumb. That was a send! Next up is Baxter and team Birdies. That'll work. Kah-fucking-PING! Shit. Captain's choice. Which ball will you choose, Captain Baxter? I think we'll be using my ball, sir. Too easy, baby. Yes, sir. There she is. This one's going down the pipe. Party boy! Oh, John Nightly shows us his famous beer shower celebration. I am the best golfer ever! Now for the birdies. Oh my God. I fucking love you guys. Baxter up first. Hey, yeah. Is this a joke? Oh my God, I hate poor people. Now at the tee, Nick Hayes. Whoa. Sweet. Next up, Emily Calhoun. Ooh, I'm a girl! I might ask her out later. And last up, Khalil Al-Asmari, the newest member of Twin Pines. [Ingersall This guy's got all types of talent. The late edition from team Birdies is really lighting it up. Where did he come from? Who is this guy? Twin Pines is so lucky to have this guy. Captain Protein rips another one. Oh, that's unfortunate. Tell you what Marv, John lightly does not look well. No, he does not. About time. I need some coke! Huh, he's fine. What'd you use bro? Well, well, well, look who showed up. You are not off the hook. Dammit, seriously. But I love you Jake Baxter no matter what you do. Now go kick this prick's ass. My girl. Daughter. Daddy. We are tied up folks! Onto the back nine. - Oh my God, that made my dick hard. Yeah, I'll stick with it. I'm gonna stick with this golf thing. Oh my gosh, you missed. That's a Birdie for Emily Calhoun of Team Birdies. Showing us their namesake in more than one way. An eagle for team Protein. Yeah boy! - Woo. - Nice. We're on the last whole game. Team protein needs something big happen here. There are one back from a playoff. Here we go. Roper. There you go. It's actually better than I thought. Jesus, you're worse than Thomas! In certain circles, that's a really good shot. Twin Pines needs just par to win and they're putting for Birdie. They've got to make this shot to win. Holy shit folks. They're blowing it. I can't believe this, Magnolia Pointe is still in this match. You putt like a girl. It's all right. Unbelievable, meltdown from these unpredictable Birdies from Twin Pines. If they can't make it, they lose, or we gotta tie and go into a three hole, one-on-one playoff. Baxter wants this one. In the hole! We gotta tie folks. We go into a three hole playoff, winner take all. The team captains must play head, head, individual match play to break the tie. That's good because John Nightly is disqualified as he has passed out on hole 16 and weirdly nobody is paying any attention. Just another day on the course for Nightly. Magnolia Pointe is away, so Boyd will tee off first. HADOUKEN. Fuck. Baxter for eagle. You know what to do Jakey Bear. Oh my God. Not only are you a part of this universe, but you are the universe. For sure, thanks dude. You are that tiny little white ball. Nick, I'm trying to focus here, man. You're that tiny little white ball that happens to have a big fat hickey on your neck. I don't have a fucking hickey, just get outta here, dude. Good luck. So annoying. Mark it. Big mistake and a disappointment for that Eagle. You know what to do Adrian- Fuck bro. I'm sorry, I'm sorry about that. And Boyd makes the putt in the hole. Whoa baby. Yet another Birdie. Big missed opportunity. Baxter still manages to be one under in the playoffs. One under for Boyd and Baxter and on to the next. How do my calves look? Always beautiful, you know that? Yes sir. HADOUKEN! From earlier. It's fine, I don't mind a shorter walk. Did you dye your hair more blonde? What? Did you dye your hair more blonde? This is fucking natural. That's what I'm talking about, baby. And Boyd makes the putt. It's in the hole. On to the next. Birdie, Birdie. Yessir! We're on the final hole, people. This is a 300 yard par four. And I believe both these gentlemen are capable of getting it near the green, but it will take a lot of club, John. And even more balls, Marvin. Yes, John. It will take big, huge testicles. Boyd with an amazing drive. This is my storybook ending. This is my storybook ending! And some inappropriate gestures being exchanged folks. So if you have any kids that are watching at home, you should really rethink your parenting and grab a Swinger Lite. Long day on the links? Pound a Swinger. We love Swinger. That's right, John. Speaking of Swinger, Adrian Boyd could still swing himself into a birdie if he can get on the green with his next shot. Or Baxter's short game could fail him once again. That's possible. It's the perfect hole? We are the Birdies... Birdies, birdies Birdies, birdies, birdies Birdies, birdies, birdies! Here we go. Birdies. Birdies! There we go. Let's go! Louder! Birdies, birdies, birdies. Birdies, baby! BIRDIES FOREVER! I am Jake fucking Baxter and I am BACK! Wooohooo! Nick, hand me that motherfucking two- That's exactly what I wanted. How'd you know? Win or lose, that's cool that you know I was gonna... That's pretty cool. Right right, we're-yeah! Here we go. It's a beautiful shot. That is a sniper shot, the best I've ever seen. Damn it's a SNIPER SHOT! Could this even be possible? Has anyone ever? It's a hole in ONE I can't believe it! Jake Baxter just aced a par four! He need a Birdie but he got an albatross. Yeah, my boy! Adrian Boyd is out of this match! Oh my God. Well, so I guess I work for you now. Partners? Something like that. I think you should probably kiss me now. Oh yeah. - Yeah. Conroy, that was the fu- Oh my God, did not know you guys are about to kiss. I am so sorry. Dude, I am so sorry. We weren't about to kiss, we were kissing. Thry were kissing. I'll let it slide. I've never seen anything like that, Jake. You saved my ass. Yeah, I kinda did, didn't I? It's the best job I ever, dude. Anything you want, you got it. You're home now. You hear me, the both of you. Appreciate that, thank you Conroy. I guess I'll have my attorney start to make arrangements. You got my number, I'll expect keys in two weeks. I'm gonna call the motel, have 'em save our favorite suite. Not here, later, later. All right, yeah. I'll see you at Thanksgiving, Mr. Boyd. We don't have to talk about any of this. Adrian. Look, man, I still don't like you but, goddammit. You respect me? No, I realized soon as I said that, it sounded like I was gonna say respect. It was not, it's more like, I think you're a good golfer. Well, looks like you got a new club, boss. Yeah, don't get too excited. I might fuck it up. I'm not gonna! White people. So, when are we gonna work on my putting game, huh? Oh, putting is not my department. I would defer to my short game professor, Nick. He'll take it from here. Won't you follow me, Ms. Gladys. His putting sucks the ass. I'm working on it. Yeah okay. What the hell are we gonna do about these guys? They can sleep it off. Yeah, I feel like we should call the greens keepers. I feel like you're probably right. Hey greens, we could use a clean up at the driving range. Got three naked dudes laying here. Copy clubhouse, Adrian is on his way. If you guys are talking about my dad again, you can screw off! He's happy. Thank you very much. Do me a favor, when you're done fixing that boys, come up here and fix this for me. Fix what? Hey what'd I miss? Oh, just another day at Twin Pines, you know. I tell you what, I'm thirsty. I'll take a water 'cause I'm pregnant. Well, I mean we're pregnant. She's pregnant. Well, this round's on me. Thanks so much. Yeah. To Twin Pines, may the tradition continue to continue. - Twin Pines.
