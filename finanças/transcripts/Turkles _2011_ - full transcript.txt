[ Music ] - Loggerhead Marine Patrol 1 to base. - This is base, go ahead. - Looks like we have a nest that's been disturbed about 300 yards north of the Juno Pier. The one we staked yesterday. May be some evidence of poaching. - Okay Patrol 1. We'll have Florida Fish and Wildlife come check it out. - Okay campers. Come on, gather around so you can hear me. - Yo ho. First thing. Let's put on plenty of sunscreen because we're going to be out in the sun all day. - Yes we are. And we don't want any mom's getting angry. - No. Jen and David, why don't you guys come over here. Let me introduce you. This is David and Jen. They were 6th graders like you just a few summers ago. Starting out as volunteers. - Now they're an integral part of our turtle watch group. And they get to do fun stuff like document this season on video. - And if you stick around for the next few summers, you could be a Loggerhead camp counselor too once you're ready to go into the 8th grade. - Let's introduce you to the rest of the gang. - Come on over guys. Okay. This is Nathan, Sarah, and Hector. They're going to be your camp counselors this summer. And this is Taylor. This is Jen's sister. She's going to be helping out too. Okay. Let's go. - We're looking for any signs that the female turtle has come up on the beach. Mounds, tracks, scrape marks, any changes to habitat. - What are those stakes for? - Good question. Let's check it out. Okay. This marks where the female has come the night before and laid her eggs. - We mark it with a stake and a tag, and then we keep records approximately when the eggs are going to hatch. Then we try to be around to make sure that the hatchlings make their way back to sea. - So that's when we come in, right? - That's right. We want to be here to be sure that when they scamper out of the sand and into the water, they don't become dehydrated or attacked by predators. - So if you see any little baby struggling hatchlings, then keep them close together. Please don't step on them. And just steer them towards the water. Urge them on. There's a nest just up ahead where we think the timing's right for the hatchlings to make a run for it. - Check out this other nest first, while Mattie takes Jen's video crew over to the other nest. - Okay? Let's go guys. - What happened here? - We found this earlier this morning. It's hard to tell. Raccoons, skunks maybe. - Could it be human skunks? - Yeah. It could be poachers. But for now let's opt for the predatory animal scenario, so as not to alarm the kids. - But you don't really think so? - We're not so sure. But for now the official story is raccoons. - Got it. - Hey, look at them. - Turtle geeks? What's the big deal with turtles anyway? - Yeah. I don't get it. - Don't they have a life? - Maybe we should rain on their parade a little bit. - And what could the big deal with turtle eggs anyway. They've got to taste awful. - The environment. It's all about the environment, man. - You're not getting all tree hugging on us are you? - No. But we all got to live here don't we? Show some respect. [ Music ] - So that's what we have so far. - Here's what's left on the shot list. - We need to tape the orientation meeting tonight before the beach walk to get some more egg-laying footage. - And we have to remember that night viewing device for the camera lens. - Right here on the equipment list. - How much editing is left? - We get the rest of the footage we need in the next few nights, and we'll be done editing by the end of the summer. - You see we edit as we go. We do have a couple more interviews that we have to shoot, though. - Yeah. We have to get the turtle diva down on the beach when she gets back to town from up north. - The turtle diva? [ Music ] - So can I. Get you anything else? - How about a ride on my fishing boat? - Ooh, I'm sorry I get seasick. - [Laughing] I got just the remedy for that. - Look. She's not interested. - Just kidding with her. - She's not laughing. - What are you, her knight in shining armor? - That's all right. I can take care of myself. Thanks. - I just bet you can. That just got you fired, hotshot. - Sorry I'm late. My mother was delayed picking me up. - Why didn't you drive yourself? - Oh I don't drive. - You don't drive? You don't know how to drive? - I never had the occasion to learn. Or the need. My mother drives me everywhere I have to go. - Stop. Why don't all you guys just get regular jobs? - [Laughing] What? [Laughing] Practicing really does work. I'm getting better all the time. - So, you all remember why you're here. Your mission. - Why can't you just use eggs from the supermarket for your secret recipes? - These eggs are wrapped a lot different. Loggerhead eggs are special. Some people spend a lot of money to get them. It's your job to get them for me. - Can we be arrested for this? - Of course you can. That's why it's called the crime syndicate. That's why I'm paying you $5 bucks an egg to steal them for me. So you'll be careful. - I've calculated the risk-reward ratio and I'm not sure it's worth it. - Well it's too late to back out now. You guys come highly recommended to me. I don't know why. And we need to start tonight. It's the height of the season and we need to act now, otherwise other guys will be out there taking our eggs. As far as getting arrested? It's a big beach out there. Just keep a low profile at this meeting tonight and no one will suspect you. Remember, low profile. Don't draw attention to yourself. And if Fish and Wildlife come after you, just run into the ocean and swim away. - I can't swim. - Just pretend you're swimming. - Hmm. - Until they give up the pursuit. You said you were an actor. Act like you're swimming. - Don't forget the water. Are you ready to go? Let's go. - Talk to her again. - Okay little ones. Stick with the group. - Don't wander off. - I know. You say the same thing every time. - You are my babies. It's my job to worry about you two. - What are you going to do when I'm wandering the Amazon, or traipsing off to the Galapagos? - I'll be here at home, quietly having a nervous breakdown all alone, wondering if you have enough sunblock on. - Dad, I'm a scientist. I know about these things. - Well, don't forget your - - Bug spray. It's in my backpack. - And look after your sister. Taylor, don't go wandering off. - It's on my list, dad. - Mom, why do we got to take care of him? - Because your Aunt Catherine can't, that's why. Some people can take care of their kids. My sister is not one of those people. And besides, he's your cousin. He won't get in the way. He doesn't say much. - Mom, he doesn't say anything. - Well maybe he can help you out with your project? - What's he know about turtles? - Well maybe he knows something that you don't know. - Like what? - Hmm. Be nice. I've got to go get him at the bus station while you're out tonight. It won't be that bad. He reads a lot. He's a bookworm. - Great. A worm. I'll feed him to my fish. - Wise guy. - Yes, karaoke. It's my creative outlet. You got a problem with that? What about you? - Your name is Lulu? - He was named after my father. - Your father's name is Lulu? - No, just Lou, but my parents wanted twins. I told you. I'm really an actor. I have a screen actor's guild card to prove it. - Oh really. And what movie might we have seen you in? - I had a speaking line in "Empire of the Ants." They shot it out in Belle Glade in 1978. I was 10 years old at the time. - You actually had a line? Would you care to recite it for us? I'm sure you remember it. - Certainly. You remember when the ants were exposed to the toxics waste at the sugar refinery? And turned into gigantic monster ants chasing the people all over Belle Glade? I'm the guy who says, [screaming]. - Hey, Einstein, we're trying not to draw attention to ourselves. Don't you remember what the boss said? - Every spring, Florida's beaches come alive with the excitement of the sea turtle nesting season. The nesting season lasts from March through late October, and allows us to witness one of nature's most awe-inspiring moments. In the Juno Beach, Jupiter, area we see mostly Loggerheads, Greens, and Leatherbacks in our offshore waters and laying eggs on our beaches. Hawksbill and Kemp's Ridley are seen, but they usually don't nest here. For the past 10 years, we've been averaging almost 7,000 sea turtle nests on our beaches between John D. McArthur Park and the Jupiter Inlet. Nest count for Loggerheads has been steadily declining in our area from the high of over 6,000 nests in 1995 to about 2,800 in 2009. Loggerheads drop about 100 eggs per nest. It takes about 60 days for the eggs to incubate. Sometimes it takes a little help from some of our staff members at the Loggerhead Marine Life Center in Juno Beach. But this should never be attempted by anyone else. There are stiff penalties for tampering with nests or touching sea turtle hatchlings. Poaching eggs can drop fines of up to $100,000, plus time in prison. Yet each year, people still try to steal turtle eggs. Once the hatchlings are free, they scamper to the surf before they become breakfast for a seagull. Survivor rates are small. Only about 1 in 1,000 to 1 in 10,000 survive into adulthood. All of this puts special pressure on all of us to make our beaches as welcoming to sea turtles as possible. That includes keeping lights off on the beach at night. Lights distract the hatchlings and may cause them to run in the wrong direction, away from the water. Scientists at the Loggerhead Marine Life Center conduct nesting surveys to better understand reproductive behavior. Over time, the researchers will better understand the overall health of each species. They also monitor activity to determine trends, migration patterns, threats, and genetics. Loggerhead Marine Life Center also has a hospital where injured sea turtles can be treated for injuries and illness before being released back into our waters. To do this, they rely on a small paid staff, volunteers, and financial support from the community. [ Applause ] - And now, Christy and Natasha will take you for the moment you've all been waiting for, the the beach walk. [ Applause ] [ Music ] - If we see a sign of any turtles, be silent until after she begins laying her eggs. - Wait, wait, wait, wait. How can you tell it's a she? - What do you mean? - Well, you just said after she begins laying her eggs. How can you be sure the turtle laying the eggs is a she? - They wear little skirts. - Is your mom around? - No. But I can go get her. - She might be able to explain. - Don't ask any stupid questions. We don't want anyone to remember us. All we're trying to do is fade into the background here. So don't do anything that's going to make us stand out. - So anyway, for the rest of us. If we're still conscious. If a Loggerhead is disturbed or alarmed in any way, she'll go back out to the water. She'll lay her eggs out there, and they're all going to drown. That could be a loss of over 100 eggs, and with a high attrition rate already, that could be a significant loss. - Do turtles have any natural predators? - Once the mother lays the eggs and buries them, they still face a danger from raccoons, skunks, foxes, and other animals who are hungry. - We came across a nest this morning that we think might have been raided by a raccoon or a skunk. - What about poachers? - Poachers are actually a big problem. The eggs bring big money on the illegal exotic foods marketplace, for health reasons. - We have many cultures here in South Florida, and some have traditionally thought that turtle eggs reinvigorate them better than vitamins can. - Yeah. Some people consider them a delicacy. Others think it helps their romantic attraction. - So how do we know if it's a she? - Just out of curiosity, not that I would ever want to or need to acquire and sell a turtle egg under any circumstance, how much would an egg go for in the black market? - That varies. Anywhere from $10 to $50 an egg. - So that's $1,000 to $5,000 per drop? - Yes. Why do you ask? - Like I say, just idle curiosity. Just in case I had to write a term paper or something like that for marine biology. - Oh. Are you a marine biology student? - No. Not currently. But maybe someday. I wanted to take a class. And I had to do a term paper. I find this subject, well dog gone it, downright fascinating. - But he said we'd only get $5 an egg. - That's what we get. He probably gets $15 bucks per egg. - Maybe we should find a different buyer. Deal direct. Eliminate the middle man. - Yeah. That'll be fine if we knew was it was we had to deal with. - All right. - Okay. We're approaching the beach. So we need to get really quiet, and hopefully see some turtles. - There's one on her way up. - Ooh awe. - Quiet everyone. I got to take some cut aways. - Wow, more good stuff. - How long do we have to wait? - It's been a half an hour since they left. Come on, let's go. [ Moaning Sounds ] - It's icky. - You know, I'm trying to remember when the last time was I heard an adult use the word icky. - I use the word icky because that's what it is. It's icky. It's a perfectly legitimate word, and it describes precisely what it is. It's icky. - Well maybe you haven't heard it used lately, because adults don't usually do icky stuff like this. - Correction. Most adults in their right minds don't usually do icky stuff like this, which leads us to tonight. - You know they kind of look like ping pong balls. - Ping pong balls don't look like that. - Hey guys. This is my cousin Izzy from New York. He's come to live with me and my mom. Make him feel like he's at home. - What's up, Izzy. - Hey Izzy. - Hi. I'm Taylor. - Welcome to Florida, Izzy. - Kristy, what do you make of this discovery today? - This is two nests in two days. Just a really big loss. - Mattie, was the first nest the result of animal predators? - We'll never know for sure. - We just know this is over 200 Loggerheads that will never grace our seas now. Big loss. - We've got to do something. - Yeah. - As God is my witness, I'm going to find out who stole these turtle eggs. - What are those guys doing here again? - I don't know. Let's check it out. - What are you guys doing here again? - We really enjoyed it so much, so enlightening. I'm trying to write some original music for a Broadway play. - Last night it's a term paper. And tonight it's a Broadway play? Quite a talented group you have here. - There's something just magical, and the way these gentle giants know how to make it to our shores at just the right moment. And then Mother Nature instructs her how to dig a nest to put her eggs, where they'll be safe, while their incubated in the warmth of the South Florida beach sand. It's just one of those things that makes living in Palm Beach County such a delight. It's all just so poetic. Don't you think? - You know. This is much easier than having a real job. - How would you know? - And I'm not out in the hot sun all day either. - Just keep digging. You know, tomorrow night we better bring some disguises, because if they see us again, they'll liable to get suspicious. [ Music ] - The Loggerhead will make her way up, she'll come to this hole then she'll use her flippers to dig down. - Oh no. Not again. - That's three for three. - Well at least two for three. - This can't be happening. - We've got to do something. - Can't we get the Florida Fish and Wildlife Management to investigate? - We've got to find out what's going on one or another. Who's with me tonight? - What's tonight? - Well if it isn't the turtle geeks. How's it going turtle geeks? - Oh grow up. - You mean like turtle boy there? Hey turtle boy. - Where is your cape and tights? - I heard you guys lost some eggs. - You mean lost some marbles. - How did you guys know about that? - Word travels fast. - Well, what's up with that guy, Wax? - Don't pay any attention to him. He's just jealous. - Jealous? Jealous of what? Turtle boy here? - What's his deal anyway? - He had a crush on me in the 4th grade and I rejected him. He's never gotten over it. Never lets me forget it. - Why did you reject him? - Definitely not my type. If you ask him to read a book or write a friendly letter, he'd break into a nervous sweat. - I heard that. And I did read a book. Once. - See you guys later. - What do you think Jen meant when she said are you with me tonight? - I'm almost afraid to think of what she means. - We'll just have to wait and see. - [Laughs] see my new golf cart on the way in? It's custom-built, air conditioned. Getting better all the time. So, you want $10 an egg instead of $5 an egg. Huh? Have you lost your minds? - How did you know that? - We might know of an alternative buyer. - Guys like you could get in serious trouble if you get caught selling those eggs to the wrong people. Now get out there and steal some more eggs. I got a tee time over at Melaleuca Links. And watch out for my golf cart. Costs more than your house. And don't try any funny stuff if you know what's good for you. - How can we tell what's good for us? - What's an alternate buyer? - I know we can find someone else to buy these things. Although I don't know why they would. - That's not your job to try and understand why anybody would want to buy them. That's for the deep thinkers on his crew. Like me. - So have you figured out why yet? - Don't get me started. - I though you wanted to get started? - Shotgun. - Whip, whip, hit the deck. - We could try selling the eggs at the flea market. - Listen. Forget about that for now. If we're not going to get recognized tonight, we're going to have to go in disguise. Now we'll meet up later at Bermuda's house. Everybody bring their disguise. And you better make them good. Now pipe down so I can back up and we can get out of here. [ Car Starting ] [ Crashing Sound ] [ Car Alarm ] - I thought you were a driver's ed teacher? - Make that past tense. - He was a driver's ed teacher. - Should we call an ambulance? - There's nobody in it. - Wow. Feel that air conditioning. Ooh. - Wow. Now we're getting somewhere. - Entre vous gentlemen. - Would you like a beverage? A drink? - Ah, my mom doesn't allow me to drink. - Ooh, a few Shirley Temples then perhaps? - There's more than one Shirley Temple? - What are you supposed to be? - I can spot who you are a mile away. - Harold, I'm disguised. - How. You're wearing the same thing you were wearing before. Glasses and a fake mustache. I said a disguise, not a costume. - But I don't understand. People don't recognize you know who when he steps out of a phone booth and just puts on a pair of horn rim glasses like these. - What's a phone booth again? - It's just a little something from the olden days. - The you know who you're referring to is a comic book character. - This is real life. - Oh. Just call me soup. - What are all these superheroes doing on your shelf? - They're very special to me. - Yeah, I gathered that. - I designed them for the superhero movies I'm going to make some day. They're my bankroll for the future. - You need to have you head examined. - Did my mom tell you that? - Mom? - Do you want some bologna sandwiches? - Thanks mom. You're the best. [ Loud Burp ] - Excuse you. - I beg your pardon. - Is it Halloween already? - Yeah. We need to keep an eye on these guys. - Yeah. Especially her. - What are you doing? - I forgot to put on my fake mustache. - It's too late for that now. Everybody's already seen you. - Do you think they recognize me? - Ahh. - I didn't recognize him. - Ahh. - You know what I noticed? They put sticks above where the turtles lay their eggs. The sticks mark where the egg nests are. - You haven't been with us the last two nights? - Tomorrow night's my karaoke night. You can come and watch me sing, and then we can all come here and go to work afterwards. - Hey. Follow the stakes. - It's got to be those guys again. It can't be a coincidence. - I'll bet they come out on the walks just to see where the eggs are. - And what's with the costumes? - This makes no sense whatsoever. - We'll just have to come back to this spot later on tonight and see if we can catch them red-handed. - I can't get out. - We'll get caught if we try to sneak out. - But Jen's right. I mean it's the only way. - Mom's exhausted. We should be able to do it. - Izzy. Don't say anything to my mom, all right? That was easy. You don't say much anyways. - Going to hit the hay girls. - Tired from work? - Yep. Turn off the lights and lock the doors before you go to bed. - Will so. See you in the morning. We've got a big day tomorrow. You too? - Yep. Big day. - You know I can't let you go, right? - I know. When I get older. - You'll be there soon enough. - I know. - There'll be plenty of opportunities. - Hey Jen? - Yeah? - You'll be really careful out there, won't you? - You're starting to sound like dad. - That's not such a bad thing is it? - No. That's not a bad thing at all. It's a good thing. We're lucky that way, you know. - I know. You'll remember what he always says, right? - I know. Use good judgment, I promise. - Wake me up when you get home. [ Snoring Sounds ] [ TV Playing ] [ Music ] - Come on. Oh, ouch. We are going to be late, so I'll see you tomorrow. Okay? - I'll be okay. See you in the morning. - Come on Vic. - Okay okay. - It'll work. Soon as he gets here. - I've never done anything like this before. - All right. Come on, let's go. Lots of new stakes here. This will be the perfect spot for them to choose. - Let's hide in the sea grate and wait for them to walk by. - No one's supposed to be on the beach this late, so if anyone is walking around, we can assume they're up to no good. - Hey look. Here they come. - We got you. We got you. - Fish and Wildlife. - Uh oh. - All right you kids just hold off. We're placing you under arrest for suspicion of robbing turtle nests. - What? That's crazy. We're here to catch those guys. - Well we got tipped off from Camp Loggerhead. - I guess they knew what they were talking about. - No. We're trying to find the bad guys. You have the wrong people. - Sorry, son. We're placing you all under arrest. You can call your parents when we get back to the station. - My dad is going to go crazy. - Your dad's already crazy. - Only during baseball season. - 1-6-3 Palm Beach. - 1-6-3, go ahead. - Five juveniles 10-15 reference 63 tango. 10-51 JBPD. - 10-26. - Wow. That was close. - Why do you suppose they're arresting those kids? We're the bad guys. They must be confused. - Tipped off perhaps. - Too bad. Now those kids are going to have a record. - A record? I'm trying to get a record too. - Enough with that mustache. We need to get some eggs. - Okay. - There's little turtles in there. I bet they're so cute. - You again. All right. - Isn't that my line? - You're the lady who got me fired. - Oh I didn't get you fired. That's what you get for not minding your own business. And your daughter got my son arrested, by the way. - What? That's nonsense. - Ah. The truth hurts doesn't it? - Okay. Parents. As soon as you get them signed out, you can take them home. - Today just isn't our day. - What do you mean? - Dad got fired today and you got arrested. - Fired? You got fired? - Hey Sarah, where's your mom? - I don't know. She's out late again, as usual. - Come on, we're going to take you home. Let's go. - Hey. We can't release her without a parent or guardian. - Officer Nelson, you got to be kidding me. It's me. - Okay Maggie. I mean, okay, yeah right. - Yeah, and you know, while you're at it, why aren't you out catching the real poachers. What are a bunch of kids going to do with turtle eggs? Paint them for turtle Easter? I mean, could you use just a little common sense. A little. - Okay Maggie. - Yeah, okay. Yeah. - Okay, Let's go. - So when's turtle Easter? - You know, David, we knew it was going to be hard after your father died. We have to resign ourselves to one day at a time. - But mom - - I am doing the best that I can, but I need you to participate. - But mom, someone's stealing the turtle eggs. - We can't save the planet, David, we can hardly save ourselves. - But mom, you know if we don't do it, then who will? - You know why I'm so mad? Because I know you're right. You're going to have to start looking after your cousin. - Why? - Because I have to work a second shift. And you may not be able to go to Camp Loggerhead. - That's not fair. - Life isn't fair, David. Just ask your turtles. Only 1 out of 100 survive. Maybe 1 out of 1,000. My job is to make sure you survive. And I can't do that without your help. - I have my friends for support, mom. - You won't be hanging out with those same friends all your life. Two three years from now, those friends that you have, you'll pass them in the hall and you won't even say hello to them. You'll have gone your separate way. They'll have gone their separate ways, and moved on to different things. - That's really sad, mom. - Yeah, David, it is really sad. But it's real life. - Do you really believe that? - I don't know. All I do know is that life doesn't get any easier for guys like you. And I'm working a double shift from here on out. - Awe, mom. - Look. - Okay. This is getting really old. - Every day is the same. - We watched the eggs drop, then the next morning they're gone. - I mean, this is three nights in a row now. - And the ironic part is they must have been stolen when you guys were in jail. - Is this something your friend Wax would do? - I don't think he's that malicious. He's all bluff. Beside, a lot of surfers are environmentalists at heart. They just don't want to admit it. - Ah, smells like mustard. Or do we have our Halloween characters to blame? - Those pinheads? - Yes. - Those pinheads. [ Music ] - Fifteen hundred bucks for three night's work. That ain't bad. - Hey. We need to get some eggs. And get ready to write down these stake locations. - I can't see in this light. - Don't turn around. I think we're being watched by our costume guys. Let's drift over to the sea grate. - We'll keep an eye on them. - Tonight we'll catch 'em red-handed. - You mean sneak out again? - Well, it's the only way. Are you in? - I guess. - Man, I don't think I can make it. I mean, you know my dad. He would go ballistic. - That's one way to get him off the sofa during baseball season. - Jen and David can handle it. I know they can. [ Music ] - Wow. Listen to those waves. - The tide will be high tonight. Remind you of anything? - The tide rises. The tide falls by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. The tide rises. The tide falls. The twilight darkens. The curlew calls. Along the sea sands dampen brown. The traveler hastens toward the town, and the tide rises, the tide falls. - Darkness settles on roofs and walls, but the sea in darkness calls. The little waves with their soft white hands efface the footprints in the sand. And the tide rises, the tide falls. - The day returns, but nevermore returns the traveler to the shore. The tide rises, of the tide falls. Complements of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow and our esteemed English teacher, Mr. Dunkin. - Most kids erased it from their memory the day after the test. Except you. - Well, and you. Why? - I don't know. - You think you'll remember that poem when you go to college. - Eighth, 9th, 10th, 11, 12. That's five more years until we're off to college. That's University of Florida? - Yeah. If my mom wins the lottery. Either way, you've got a better chance of selling a movie script then, you know, winning the Florida lottery, so. - About the same, probably. The poem says that the traveler never returns to the shore. You think when you move away from here you'll ever return? - Of course. You know I love it here. - Despite all that's happened? - Sure. - Ever wonder what the future holds for kids like us? - You mean kids like us living in our trailer park lives? Like my mom would say? - Yeah. I guess you can call it that. - Ten years from now, what? I'll be a bag boy at the supermarket while you're working the checkout line. That would be paper or plastic ma'am? - Not me. I'm going to have my two degrees by then. Think I'm being unrealistic? - Oh no, no. I mean just think of all the things you could do with a double degree. Marine biology, and a doctor of veterinary medicine. That'll be great. Money for your documentaries. - It's never going to happen. - Why not? - Well, for one thing, my father got fired from his job. We're probably going to lose everything. It's like this big dream that I know is never going to happen. - Well you don't know that. - Yes, I do. I know it as sure as I'm sitting here. And what's worse - - What? - I don't know what's going to happen to you. - What do you mean? - Well, let's face it. Kids like us don't stand much of a chance. I mean, look, you and your mom are barely getting by. And now your cousin is here to make things even more complicated. Spreading her even thinner. And you're going to go home someday and she's going to tell you she has got to get a second job. And you're going to wind up doing all the housework just to help out. No more time for our projects. - She already has another job. She started working two shifts. I feel really bad for her, she's so tired from just one shift, she can hardly get up to go to work in the morning. It's been really tough these past few years. - Look at my dad. He's really smart. - He's just got rotten luck. - If he didn't have rotten luck, he'd have no luck at all. He's even got a couple of degrees, believe it or not. He could teach construction in college. But those jobs are just too hard to get. - But you've got to go to college. That's your chance to get out. - Get out of what? - Get out of here. - Here? - I don't mean here, here, I mean, get out of - I don't know. - Well, we'll keep our fingers crossed. Come on. The rising tide awaits. - David. David. He's gone again, isn't he? I told him he cannot be out saving the world. - Turkles. - What? Say that again. - Turkles. - Yes. Yes. He's saving the turkles. [ Knocking on Door ] - It's almost midnight in case you are interested. - Yeah. I know what time it is. What planet are you on? Your daughter is not in her bed. - She lured my son out of the house again. - She lured him? I think not. - Uh hm. So what are we going to do with these kids? Hmm? Have any coffee in this joint? - Of course I do. What kind of place think I'm running here? - Nice. - I wasn't expecting company. - Look. - Here we go. - I can't believe they're stealing these eggs. In broad daylight. - You mean moonlight. - Oh, this night vision lens is awesome. - What do you see? Come on, let me see. - Everything. - Wait. Nothing. My battery just died. - Hey, did you see that? - Was that a red light? - It's that girl. - That was a camera. She's videotaping us. - Let's get out of here. This could hurt us. - Do you have a spare? - Sure, home on the charger. Rookie mistake. - Are you sure they were poaching? - I'm positive. And we ran because we thought they were coming after us. - Rule number 1? - Always have fresh camera batteries. - So where would they sell the turtle eggs? - Can't even imagine. I'm going to call Fish and Wildlife again and tell them about what you saw. You might want to go down the river, check out the trapper. He'll know. - Down the river? [ Music ] - Jen, David. I thought I saw you tubing down the river. So what brings you two way up here? - Turtle eggs. - I'm all out. - But we've got some cookies. - No, quit kidding. Someone's stealing Loggerhead eggs. - Well you won't find them up here. - Christy said you might know who's stealing them. And where we could find them. - There's only one place I know who sells those eggs. - Checkmate and two moves. - I'm just letting you win, you know that don't you? - Yeah, nice try. - The flea market on Saturday. They sell all kinds of contraband there. If you wanted to buy some eggs, that's where I'd go, and if you can't buy them there, they ought to be able to tell you where you can buy them. - Okay. We'll give it a try. We've got nothing to lose at this point. - I'll keep my ears open and let you know what I hear. - Thanks grandpa. - Yeah, thanks. - Next time, call us first. - Might save you a trip. - We don't want to save ourselves the trip. - Oh. I see. - We see. [ Music ] - Wow. Look at these. Lawrence Welk's Greatest Hits. [Laughing]. Julius La Rosa. Classic stuff. - I think I figured out a way we can trap these guys. How? - Set up decoy stakes at the beach. - Okay. - Then set up a camera nearby. This time with fresh batteries. - Yeah. - Have them walk right into my video frame. - [Sigh]. I could put a wireless mic on the stake. We'll record what they're saying as they dig through the sand. - Awesome. - Hey, look. That's them. - What? - How about placing a wireless mic on yourself right now and wandering over towards their booth. - I'm game. Let's do it. - All right. - Hey David? - Yeah? - Be careful. - I will. - I'm feeling kind of run-down lately. Do you have anything for that? You know like vitamin eggs? - I think we might have just the ticket. - Let's see. Ah. A dozen eggs. Let's call it $250 bucks. - What? $250 for a dozen eggs? That's preposterous. These flea markets are supposed to be cheaper. - I told you we couldn't afford to live in Florida. - Hah. - Thanks, man. Best prices in town. That's half of what I usually pay. - You mean I could have charged you twice as much? - Too late, man. - Hey you. It's those kids. - Hey, and they got that camera again. - Let's get 'em. [ Car Screeching ] [ Sniffing Sounds ] - I smell rotten eggs. Did you step in something? - We think they were taping us at the beach the other night. - They taped us at the flea marketing today too. - What were you doing at the flea market today? - Looking for some superheroes. - Looking for new household appliances. - Uh, looking for 8-tracks? - Were you selling eggs on your own? Huh? Freelancing? Is that why you haven't brought me any eggs for the last two nights? You guys could get hurt trying to pull something like that. Don't even think about trying it. I'll be going with you tomorrow night. I need those eggs. Our customers are getting angry. And you better get that videotape from those kids if you know what's good for you. Get that tape. That's a direct order. And you, you owe me for that golf cart. You're going to be stealing turtle eggs for the next 100 years. I want that footage, and I want more eggs. - There's a skylight on the roof. Open it up and then lower yourself down. - Why are you telling me? - I've got a bad back. Really, I do. - Well how do you propose I get on that roof? - Thought you'd never ask. - Simple. You just shimmy up the drainpipe. - Ha. Shimmy? Ha. This drainpipe? - This drainpipe. - [Grunting sounds] - Is everything okay up there? Ah, oh. - Uh, I wasn't supposed to be on the bottom. - [Multiple grunting sounds]. [Screaming] [Crashing] - Well, that was really close. [Breaking glass] - Yeah. Lucky no one got hurt. - Oh. What are you doing out here? - You're supposed to be inside. - I knew we couldn't count on you. - The door is now open, gentlemen. Ugh. - You have glass splinters sticking out of your cheek. - Nah. Nah ha ha nah. - Wow. Look at all these buttons. Is that what a computer looks like? - How would I know? - What exactly are we looking for? - That tape they took of us. - What will a tape look like? - Like those 8-tracks he stole the other day. - Awe, come on. Those were of Julius La Rosa. Who was going to buy them? - Stealing is wrong. - Oh yeah? Aren't we stealing turtle eggs? - Come on. Let's get out of here. - Do you believe those guys actually broke in and tried to steal our video? - Luckily, they didn't find what they were looking for. It's all the more reason why we got to catch these guys. [ Music ] - You really think this will work? - Sure. They're greedy and lazy. - A perfect combination for failure. - So meet back here tonight, after the walk-out. - How you guys getting out? - I don't know. My dad and I had this little talk. - There's a baseball game tonight. He usually falls asleep around the fourth inning. - It's a Saturday night. They'll leave early and come home on Sunday. - Mom's working two shifts, remember? What about you? - I'll just have to wait until my father goes to sleep. - That won't be long these days. - So what are we going to do about this? - There's something in the air. - I don't know. I ran out of answers a long time ago. - Seems to me this is pretty important to them. Nathan wouldn't risk getting into trouble and being so involved, unless they were all pretty much committed. - Something tells me they're planning to go out tonight. Maybe even tomorrow night after the beach walk. - Think you're right. I overhead Jen and David talking earlier. - We might want to think about following them when and if they think about sneaking out again. Although I do have a hard time believing that Nathan would do such a thing. - Well I guess when you're trying to save the planet, the rules don't apply. - Don't tell them that. Let's let them sneak out one more time. Force the issue. - I don't think that's such a good idea. These guys could be desperate. Maybe dangerous. - All the more reason why we should exchange cell numbers. - Will I be home in time for the game? [ Music ] - Hey Jen. Hi five. [ Dialing Phone ] [ Cell Phone Ringing ] - I just have to get this for one second. Hello. - Deb? You were right. She just left with her video camera. - Okay. You know what? Grab the others, I'm on my way. You guys. You have to take this food over to that couple over there. And here. Here's your check. - This isn't what we ordered. - I know. Bring it to the people over there. - I got my eyes on you guys tonight. Let's get an accurate count. We need at least 300 eggs. - I would sing early. There's a brand new stake right over there. - Easy pickings. We should be finished early. - This sure beats following them around to get to this stake's location like we have been doing. - They're being very considerate. - Makes our sleuthing a whole lot easier. - Will you put that away? You're liable to start a fire with that thing. We can get rich stealing these eggs. - Yeah. Or wind up in jail. - Yeah. This is going to be the last trip for me. - What are you talking about? The season's just beginning. - I don't know. I've been asked to go on an international tour with my karaoke club. - No way. You think I'm letting you out of your contract? - I didn't know we had a contract. - What's this? - What is it? - It's a wireless microphone, pinhead. - What's a wireless microphone pinhead? - No, you're the pinhead. It's the type of microphone they use. - Yeah, to catch bad guys. - Like us. - Before they send them off to jail. - But I never wanted a life of crime. Who will take care of my mom? What will happen to my action figures? [Crying] - Look. Kids. There. The the - - Go get them. - They saw us. - Let's get out of here. - Grab them, grab them. - I'm tired of these kids. They're jeopardizing my lifestyle. - Did you hear what I said? - Wait a minute, wait a minute. I didn't sign up to hurt any kids. Besides, it might have a long term impact on my record sales. - You're not making records anymore are they? - Oh, figure of speech. - Didn't you hear what I said? Go get them. - Oh no. We're not hurting any kids. They're an important constituency for my movies. - Constituency. How do you spell that? - My target demographic. - One at a time, will you? - They're, my audience. - Wow. This is just like watching a movie. - What are you guys doing here? - This is where we live. I think this guy needs to get his mouth washed out with some surfboard wax. - No, seriously. What are you guys doing here? - It's the beach, we live here. - My mom is going to kill me. - Yeah. Like she was off to such a great start already. - I don't even want to think about what my mom's going to say. - My recording career was finally within reach. And now it's all gone in a blink of an eye. And for what? How could I have been so short-sighted? - What about you? How does your mom going to take it? - She's still mad at me because I got one of her dresses all sandy. - Hey guys. What's up? - Dad? - What are you guys doing here? - Just trying to save the planet. - One turkle at a time. - What? - I'll explain later. - Is that you Wax? - Yes sir, Mr. Homsey. Had a summer storm coming in. Came down to check out the waves and, well. - Fish and Wildlife are here. - Hey. Watch the wrist. I've got an early tee time. - Hey. I'm going to get myself a cheap lawyer. - What is that? - I call it, Poacher's Lament. - I could write some really good lyrics for that. - You're going to have plenty of time to practice where you're going. [ Harmonica Playing ] - Thanks Wax. - Think nothing of it turtle boy. It's all a part of protecting our beach and stuff. - Come on guys, let's go. [ Music ] [ Applause ] - Thanks ukulele lady. That was really wonderful. I think. Now we have some surprise announcements from our very own turtle diva regarding our senior camp counselors. Come on up turtle diva. [ Applause ] - Thank you. For their meritorious service on behalf of all turtles worldwide. And for their capture of a band of cut-throat turtle egg poachers, and for their stunning documentary, which will have its world premiere here in a few weeks. I would like to offer the following to these five wonderful scientists of tomorrow. A free college education to the university of their choice. [ Applause ] That's right. A free, four-year scholarship to pursue their scientific studies, which will hopefully lead to a better, cleaner world. [ Applause ] [ Music ] - Are we on? Oh we're on. We're on. We're on. We're live. This is Brooke Trout coming to you live. Good side, good side. Hi. Brooke Trout coming to you live from WJUP. How does it feel to put all those dangerous criminals behind bars? - Well they weren't really dangerous. They were just kind of hapless. - [Laughing] hapless? How cute. Is that a new word? Did you just make that up? - Um, no. As a matter of fact, when the only opportunity for danger came about, they stood up to their boss to protect us. - Well, I'm sure you must have been frightened? - Not really. Between David and the rest of us and our surfing buddies, we could have handled the situation pretty well if anything threatening had popped up. Besides, those guys were just egg poachers. They had no interest in hurting us. - Now, you say they were egg poachers. Is that referring to the way they were planning to cook the eggs that they had stolen? - Uh, no. - Is there a chance that any one of them might have evolved into something more dangerous like an egg fryer? Or an egg scrambler? Or possibly even egg quiche somewhere in the near future? - Are you new at this? No I'm not, I'm a veteran. I've been doing this for weeks. Why? - Because that's the silliest question I have ever heard. [Laughing] - Let's toss it back to the studio, shall we Frank? This is Brooke Trout coming to you from the large, wooden structure. That's a wrap. [ Music ] [ Silence ] - You wanted some bologna sandwiches. - Okay. - Ah. Ah. [ Laughing ]
