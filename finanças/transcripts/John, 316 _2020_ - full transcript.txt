I remember the first time I knew I was crazy. I was ten years old and I'd hear voices. People telling me to do things. Not bad things. Mostly good things. Pick up your garbage, clean your room, don't drink that paint. I told my parents about it and they took me to a "special doctor" they called it. I remember feeling really happy because it was the first time in my life I was considered special. The doctor made me feel very comfortable as he told that all I needed to do was trust him and he'd take care of me. He was a very nice man. The psychiatrist told my parents that I had schizophrenia and some other things I can't remember. It was the best thing that ever happened to me. I've been here for 87 years, 22 months, three weeks and five days. This is my home now... and I've tried to make friends with as many of you as possible. Like "smoking guy" and "boobs" - Hi, I'm Abby. - Ada Sawyer, Nice to finally meet you. I hope I'm not interrupting. The nurse at the front desk said I should go right in. Oh, that's fine. We're just wrapping up here. Did you get settled in alright? Actually I just got here. I left my suitcase by the front desk. OK. Well when we're finished here we'll head over to the next building and we'll give you the tour. Thank you for sharing your story Bentley... Changes every time! and thank you all for welcoming Renton to our little home here. Please do everything you can to make him feel welcome. Not inside, Grayson. I think that's all for now. If anyone wants to speak alone you can come to my office. I'll be in all day. Patients have three scheduled square meals every day and a snack in the evening. Over there is the dispensary. Patients usually line up for their medications after lunch. Every patient has at least one responsibility around the hospital whether it's cleaning an area, taking out the garbage taking care of the garden or organizing board games. Having something in their care, I believe, gives them purpose in a positive way. Hey, Sawyer! We've got a new patient out front. OK. Tell them I'll be right there. Knighten. Ms. Albright is here and needs the lay of the land. Would you mind giving her the tour? I would be happy to... Ms. Albright. What? I will check in with you later. Please let me know if you have any questions... or concerns. - Please, don't hesitate... - Thank you so much She is a jealous little minx, isn't she? Come on... So, Abby, do you like gin? You seem like a gin and tonic kind of girl to me. I'm a beer and whiskey man myself although the occasional rum, vodka, wine, champagne, and absinthe sneaks into my system every once in a while, but you know, I could down some gin. I'm more of a do my job and stay hydrated kind of girl, actually. I bet you are! With that figure, I mean. I'm just messing with you, Albright. I think you're gonna love it here. We are a good group of people who like to party. The patients are good folk too. They send the violent ones to the fort or down south. Doesn't make them any less crazy though. Mentally handicaped! Of course, sorry. Doesn't make them any less handicapped. Here's your juice, buddy. It's good to have you here. I'm Knighten. What brings ya in? - Power lines talk to me. - Of course, bud. You're right. Handicapped sounds so much better. Hi there new girl. - Whoa. OK there. - Great to meet you. Give it back, Anne-Marie. Sorry, new girl, but I can't help it. I'm a klepto. Um, that's quite alright. Anne-Marie, you are not a kleptomaniac. Am so! I can't control it. Athena said I could be. See! OK, we're gonna talk about this later. Misty. How many times do I gotta tell you? You've gotta eat. I don't want it. You never want it. You don't want to get fed through the tubes again, do you? Come on. If you let me feel your arms, I'll eat. - Well, uh... - Well? Do you want me to eat or not? OK, Just... OK, but you and lamb-lamb have to eat the whole piece of chicken or this isn't happening again. - Wasn't that kind of... - Endearing? Inappropriate? Girl's got a crush on me. And if you can think of a better way to get her to eat, well I'm all ears. You can feel them too if you want? My Tricep. No. In this hallway we have the patient rooms. The most important one here is the break room. Shiela. And right here we have the peace room where the patients go if they cause a disturbance. Ed, you were doing so well. He's been going through a lot of withdrawls lately. But he would have made a great drinking buddy back in the day, so... Well, look who it is. My newest employee. - Hi, Jack. - How are you getting along so far? Great, so far, thanks. Well don't thank me, thank Kurt. - I'll be sure to do that. - Wonderful. - Hello, umm... - Knighten, Sir, again. Knighten. I'm sorry, I've forgotten. Yes, of course. We're just so busy with our bi-annual inspection here. This is my good friend Chris Stauder. Well his reputation certainly precedes him. Mr. Richman. Ms. Albright. Isn't hiring more nurses a little counterproductive to what you're trying to do around here Jack? No offense. Well Ada says she's keeping it as low as possible, but I'll explain it later. This one's on me. - Let's move on, shall we? - Of Course. Carry on soldiers. Knighten. Abby. So there's a ton of buildings on the grounds that you will go in and out of a lot. There's the staff quarters right there, and... Grayson! Not on the grass, buddy. We tried to do away with the smoking and it did not go well. - I see that. - Yeah. Well we don't do a lot of things by the book here, but sometimes that's not what the patient needs. And that is the former home for the criminally insane. Shut down in 1985. The patients are terrified of it but it is an excellent place to make out if you ever feel the need. No? No? OK. Fair enough. And this is your cell. I mean your room. You know after not paying rent for a couple of months you will be shocked how much money you save. Kinda reminds me of Summer camp, you know? Living away from civilization with a bunch of cool people... - Never went to Summer camp. - OK, so, deprived childhood. Knighten, do you mind if I get settled in. It's been a long day. Of course, of course. Settle in. I want you to feel right at home. We're all buds here. Speaking of which, the staff and I kind of have this Monday night ritual where we loosen up while the patients are in movie night. A little... I mean we're not going to have any Gin there but you're welcome to come join us. - I don't drink at work. - Good! Cause you'll be off by then. - Yay! Summer camp for Abby! - Knighten... I asked for some privacy. - You mind? - OK. Jeez. Claws away. 8 o'clock tonight. See you then. - Hey guys, how are you doing today? - Just rosy, Ada, thanks for asking. Found another fella walking around town. This one... - Butt naked! - Lovely... What's his name? No name. We didn't get a hit on his fingerprints and we're sending his picture out, but no hits. Nice guy. I think he's got a screw loose. Figured we'd just bring him by. Hairy as a pair of gopher balls I can tell you that. - Good thing Red had an old sheet in the - I will alert Athena. We'll run a full a Three... Two... One... Three... Two... One... Three. Two. One... Three! Two! One! - Three! - What ya doing Ed? My brother's coming to visit. This is what mom always did when she wanted us to do stuff. She'd count down. Three... Two... One... Well that is a novel approach Ed, but, uh everyone knows you have to count down from five. Five? I've gotta count down from five? Five. Four. Three. Two. One! Ed, your brother's been here an hour. He's waiting in the gazebo. That's not right, man! It's not right to fool a fella like that! Oh, come on, Ed. I think I saw a smile. That's right. So, John? Is it alright if I call you John? - Are you from around here, Joh - No. Do you have family? Ready for work, Ada. Just in time, beautiful. John Doe, huh? Our standard procedure is to call a new patient John or Jane Doe if their real names aren't known. They're non-offensive names. Yeah, I know. We've run all the standard medical tests on him. There appear to be no real physical problems. A little hungry, but otherwise healthy. We'll just have to wait on Athena's analysis. Thank you, John. It was really nice meeting you today. I think you'll enjoy it here while we figure out your situation. Thank you. Knighten here will take you up to your room now. Room 316. Alright, let's go big guy. He wishes not to be medicated. Something about it not being his fathers will. I'll need more time with him to see what's prudent. - Hi'ya Rog. - How ya doin, Eddie? - You feeling OK? - You know how it is. Yeah... Listen, I'm sorry Eddie. I've been there. Maybe not here, exactly, but anyways. Look I know you're jonesing, OK? I got you a little present. Shit man. - You always think about me. - Yeah. Hi fellas! Bill Johnson. I'm crazy. - Bill Johnson. Totally crazy. - Well you've come to the right place, ma I love it! Eddy, Eddy? What the hell is that man? - OK? - Excuse me. What are you... You wanna know a secret? I'm not crazy. Is that so? I'm serious. I'm not crazy at all. It's just an act. Every criminal says they're innocent. Every patient says they're sane. Ya ever hear of Stanfield and Sons? No... Move over. It's an accounting firm in New York. I've been an executive there for 12 years. Between that and my home life, it can get a bit hectic at times. - Enough to drive a man insane. - There's more under you. Every few years when I can't take it anymore, I check myself in to a hospital. I fake being crazy for a few weeks to get away from it all. So this is a holiday for you? I like the structured atmosphere. You stick to a schedule. People take care of you. They pity you. You get to be the center of attention and you don't have to worry about anything. You can act out in any crazy way you want and it doesn't matter. You put on your little costume and you play your little part in the act but everytime you step out of the house you're not you anymore. The world's a stage and you're the singing monkey. But in prison you can really do whatever you want. Because, well, what does it matter? You're already in prison! So you wanna go to prison? Is that it? Prison where guards wipe confetti off my ass, yeah! I'm just here to give you the best care possible. The best care possible. Oh, I like that. How long have you worked here? About seven hours. - So we're both new recruits? - No. You're a patient. I'm a nurse. - I'm really not crazy! - Whatever you say. OK... Bentley Murray? You need to say their first name and room number. Some of the patients don't respond to their names. Bentley. Three hundred and seven. You gotta say three, 0, seven. Three, 0, seven. No, no, no, no. You've gotta say the whole thing. Bentley. Three, 0, seven. Bentley. Three, 0, seven. That's me! No... No, she didn't. Stop. You're being rude. What happened to the red ones? You don't need those anymore. You've got blue ones now. - Will they give me superpowers? - Only one way to find out. No. X-ray vision doesn't work. Maybe I have flame throwing powers. Test it outside. Right, yes. Yes. So. Who's next? John, 316. OK. It just says NA beside his name. I guess that means he doesn't get any meds? Nah. That probably just means they haven't diagnosed him yet. - Sorry John. No meds for you today - Shouldn't we mention that to Athena? I mean maybe she prescribed something and just didn't write it down. I wouldn't worry about it. We'll talk to her tomorrow. If it's a mistake. The earlier we correct it, the better. It's not a big deal. He can go one day without meds. Depending on his condition, it's not a very good idea. Abby... Sometimes you just have to let it go. I agree... I will make sure to talk to Athena about his med chart tomorrow. Hurry up. I'm gonna beat you. Come on it's drinking night. Let's go! Who's that guy? It's the guys brother. Whose brother? The cop guy. The main guy. - Why's he digging through his desk like that? - Shut up, Bentley! I'll tell you later, OK? No. I gotta get up. I gotta get up. Gotta get up. No. Why's he going through his desk like that? I don't get that character's objective. The movie doesn't make sense! Fill it up. Fill it up. - Alright, don't be shy. Dig in. - Yeah. Cheers! Abby... You came. You invited her? Why not? She's one of us now. Here, you can have the one with the little hula girl on it. I don't want one. I just came to say hi. OK. More for me. What are you doing? Hitting the TV won't do anything. It's the tape. Don't hit it. You'll break it. Oh, great! Now you turned it off. - Turn the movie back on. Turn it on! - I said shut up, Bentley. NO! I wanna watch the movie. Shut your mouth and quit being a freak! I wanna watch a movie. I just want to watch a movie. I want... Calm down, buddy, alright. - NO! - Bentley... May the grace of the lord flow through you, Bentley. Be calm. - Uh, what? - Be calm. Peaceful. OK. - About time. - Thanks, new guy. Here's to... Here's to Abby. - OK. Abby. - Yeah. -Is he a wizard? - No, he's one of those idiots who thinks - Yeah, thinks he's Jesus. There's one in every hospital... - He looks like Jesus. - He looks like a homeless person. I think he's just crazy. Well, we're all crazy. What if he really is Jesus? - He's not Jesus! - Yeah, he's just like you, Bentley. Let's make him walk on water. You know, if you're really Jesus... You'll prove it. If you're really God... Turn this pop into wine. Like in the bible. It's water into wine, sweetheart, not pop into wine. Don't call me sweetheart! I'm not God. I am merely his vessel. Yeah, OK, whatever Jesus? Just do it. You can't come in here claiming to be sent by God and expect us to believe you. You know you're not the first guy to make that claim. Now do it! Turn that into wine. - Another? - Sure. Is anyone watching the patients? - Uhh - Should someone be? And. And the bible and the devil and Craziest thing I ever saw. Seriously crazy shit, man I don't know he did it! Shut up all of you! What the hell's going on? Knighten! Check it out. Look what the new guy did. - It's whiskey, shh... - Yeah, I can see that. Where'd you get it? - Word is God. Word is God. Water into wine. - Sit. Sit here, OK? Deep breath with me. - That means everything in the bible is real! - In... Out... In... Out... - Bentley, Shut up or I'll kill you! - Anne-Marie, stop it. The new guy said he was Jesus, so then we told him to prove it so then we gave him a cup of pop and then he turned it into alcohol. Hey, John. Come here a sec. Is this yours? Did you do this? All things are possible with enough faith. - Right... - OK. Movie night is finished. Everyone back to your rooms. Come on. You heard me. Let's go! OK everyone, you heard her... Let's go back to our rooms. So, what do we do? I don't suppose it would help to explain that changing pop into whiskey is a physical impossibility. Athena, could this event have a negative effect on their wellbeing? Oh, I don't think so. Abby? You have something to say? I think we should nip this in the bud. Right now. We can't have them believing in some kind of collective delusion. That's not healthy. It's our job to deal with people whose grasp on reality may be loose at best. Ignoring the situation or denying it happened isn't a way to gain their trust. I say we just wait. Let's see how this effects the patients. If anyone starts talking about it, don't be judgemental. Ask them what they think about it. Get them to consider alternate theories. Most of all just be open-minded. Also, Knighten... I'm well aware of your little Monday night ritual. I let it slide before but it's best if you put a stop to it... for now. I also think that's best. Of course you do. Well, thanks to John's little miracle the one bit of fun we had during the week just went up in smoke. Oh, come on. You can still go into town on your days off and drink. - Looks like he's got a few disciples already. - Don't encourage them. - Hi Knighten. - Hey gorgeous. What's going on guys? Well. He's like for real Jesus and he's really smart. He's not Jesus, you dummy. He's John... He's super smart though. He's been teaching us all sorts of stuff. Like what? Like how, you know, if we have enough faith, we can do anything. Like we can heal ourselves and stuff. That we have everything we need inside of us. That's what you said, right? Is that so? Well isn't that wonderful? You guys should probably head inside though. It's almost time for lunch. - Bye, Knighten. - Good bye, honey. I understand your concern Abby, but this isn't the first time we've had a patient claiming to be Jesus. As long as he's not harming himself or the other patients I don't think it's a big issue. I don't think he should wear the robe. It just confuses them. They're looking at him like he's some kind of leader to follow. They should be listening to the staff, not the patients. Tell you what... I will have Athena speak to the patients in their one-on-one sessions. If she feels the situation is unhealthy I will put a stop to it, OK? What? What's funny? You are funny. And stunning. And just as crazy as the rest of us. Hey? Think you can do me a favor tomorrow? For you, Albright, anything. I'm busy, Kurt, I can't just be at your disposal whenever you feel like it. I don't know! I'll call you when I'm free. Ready to go? - Anything else on the docket? - Nope. That's it. Thanks again. I am at your service m'lady. So, why don't you drive? It's a long story. I don't really want to talk about it. Well now I'm intrigued. What are we doing? We are getting a drink. - Uhh, we are? - Yup. Because we both have the day off tomorrow and you owe me for driving you into town. So we've done your thing and now we do my thing. See the thing about having an asshole for a husband is that the divorce process can take up a lot of your time and cause you a lot of undue stress. So that's why you are the way you are. - Are you making fun of me? - A little bit. Please, continue. - Do you know what he did? - No. Tell me. Sued. Me. For. Alimony... Seriously? I like this guy already. Yeah. You guys would get along great. I'll introduce you. So. Are you, like, his sugar momma now or? His family's super rich. They own Northern Hope. Jack Peterborough. It's his dad. But Kurt doesn't have a job. He's been a bum for two years now. I supported us. His family doens't give him money? Cut him off. Years ago. And now he's living in the house that I am paying for and I have to deal with his bullshit. So what does this have to do with you not being able to drive? I went out one night with some girlfriends. Tried to get my mind off of things. - Had a few drinks and... - You got pulled over. Yeah... Because I hit the cop car. Yeah it's really funny. Do you know how hard it is to get a nursing job with that on your record? - Well thank God your father in law hooked you up. - EX! - Ex... I'm sorry, I just have a hard time picturing you doing that. You know, little Miss Straight-lace. What did you call me? Oh, don't lie. You know it's true. Another round? Yeah. We'll have another round. - OK. Last one - OK. Sarah! Make that two more each. OK... I just don't think it's a problem. It gives the patients something to do and it makes their lives a little more interesting. I don't know. I just think you need to be more open to things. What makes you such an expert? See, that's just it. I am not an expert. I am just a nurse who, albeit, devilishly handsome, won't pretend that he knows anything really. Shut up. Drunkie. Come on. Get up. Hey. Do you believe in heaven? Get up. Come on. Lie down. I'm not laying down. What if somebody sees you? Fine. Amazing aren't they? Just magic up there. Is it? Here I thought it was just a bunch of electrically charged particles entering the Earth's atmosphere. - Professor Albright. - It's common knowledge. That's just what you've been told. How do you really know that? I don't think any of us really know anything. Just because you don't know something doesn't mean it's not true. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. Hmm, listen. We're educated people living in the 20th century we actually know stuff now. - We're advanced. - Yeah, OK. Just keep telling yourself that. We're advanced... So, he just kinda finishes the beer and then just throws up. - Shh, you're gonna wake everybody up. - You are louder than I am. This... I'm down this way. Good night. Abby? What? I left my keys at the bar. So, umm... Come. Come on. Hi, Abby. Good morning. I'm sorry to disturb you on your day off. Janaki is kind of sick. Do you mind doing her rounds for her? Yeah. Sure. No problem. Thank you so much. - Well that was close. - No kidding. I think you'd better get dressed. I see how it is. Just use me and toss me out. Hey, let's keep this quiet, OK? I don't think we were supposed to do that. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know the drill. I thought you left your keys at the bar. Oh, I guess I didn't. John says it's wrong to be selfish and winning money is kinda like being selfish. The power lines tell me John wouldn't do that. Guys. What's going on? Hanging out. Problem, new girl? OK... John is sick. He's not Jesus. He doesn't have magical powers. He can't predict the future. We know he's not Jesus. He's John. If he's lying how does he know all this stuff? It's not hard to gather an impression of someone based off observations. Psychics do it all the time. It's called cold reading. Cold reading. Now you're making stuff up. John doesn't make stuff up. Well alls I know is that John's helping me way more than your stupid blue pills. OK. If you think you can keep eating properly and stay in good spirits we can start taking you off your meds. But we're going to be keeping a close eye on you. She's taking me off the meds! OK, who's gonna go next? Me! Forget it, Bentley, they'll never take you off of your meds. No. John said we could have anything we need. That faith and inspiration can heal anything. OK! I'll go next! We got a pool going on when he'll be back. Do you want in? I'm saying 14 days. - That's dispicable. - OK, ease up. It's just that Ed's been in and out of here so often, you know... Kurt... Abby. So, how you been? Good, you know. I'm dating somebody now. Oh yeah, what does she do? What's that matter? Fine... Whatever... So, how's the new job? Dad really hooked you up, huh? I'm handling it. Working with the nutcases again. You would say that. I've got a new patient, John. He thinks he's Jesus. He's got the patients convinced that they can heal themselves without meds. If the psychiatric board found out. Yikes... Yeah.... That would suck. So I've got something that I wanna run by you. Like a proposal. OK. Lawyers are expensive so I'd like to keep this between us. You just give me that house and you don't have to owe me shit. No alimony, nothing. Don't laugh at me. I'm not the one that crashed my car drunk and got fired. At least I had a job, Kurt. That's how I was able to pay the down payment and pay the mortgage. You didn't pay for anything. You haven't lived there in months. And now you live where you work and you don't have to pay rent. The only reason you got that job is because my dad pities you, Ab. That's pathetic. That's worse than not even having a job. That's a lie Kurt. You're not getting the house. Look, my lawyers say that I have a good case and you have a criminal record that makes you look bad, which is the reason we split up. You know damn well why we split up. Just give me the house and you don't ever have to see me again. I intend to keep the house and still never see you again. So that's a no to my deal? Yeah, Kurt, that's a no to your deal. OK. Well then I guess we'll go to court. Attention all orderlies and staff please report to the staff room after dinner. That is all I got a phone call this morning and the board wants the old hospital cleaned. They actually called us. They're gonna start using it again? They were vague on the details but we're not here to ask questions. We're here to do our jobs. I am not cleaning that place. That place is filthy. I say we allow the patients to clean it. In return they would get a reward. Perhaps a trip into town. They're not going in there. They're terrified of that place. I'm sure we could convince them to do it. It would be very good for them to accomplish something like this together. We'll bring it up with them in the morning. Northern Hope. How can I help you? Northern Hope... Who the hell is this? Hey. What? All patients are in their rooms all accounted for. Where were you? I was in the bathroom. So, somebody's in there, huh? Yeah I keep getting these really weird phone calls at my station. The phone company said it's coming from in there. OK, so what? So are you going in there? I'm not going in there. Alright... I'll call the police. Here's your problem. This line's been functional all this time. Something finally short circuited and the phone started dialing. It's a direct line to the main building. It's just a strange coincidence. Freaky. But noone's down here. OK, great. Maybe I can still convince the patients to clean this place. There is no way in hell that I'm going in that place. It was just a mechanical problem. Nothing supernatural about it. Evil spirits can control electronical equipment and shadow people and stuff. There's no evil spirits or shadow people in the old hospital. Then why did the cops come? - It was just a precaution. - Against what? For all we know there could have been someone living in there. There was someone living in there? They didn't find anyone. There's nobody there. Human or otherwise. It's just an old building. Now we have to get in there and clean it. If we don't, they could shut this place down. You'd all be shipped off somewhere and I guarantee you it won't be as nice as this place. Now let's see a show of hands who is coming with me right now, to start cleaning the old hospital. You can't make us go in there! Is that so, Anne-Marie? Who do you think is the boss here? John's the boss! Well, Daniel, on these grounds I am god. You can't say that! If anyone has a problem, they'll be spending the night in the peace room. Stop angering the power lines! You're making God mad! - Ah, Mrs. Sawyer maybe I can talk with them. - I've got it under control Knighten! Alright, if that's the way it's going to be I will go call professional cleaners. Hopefully they can get here before the owners send us all packing. As for the rest of you, no more TV or games for the rest of the month. And curfew is no longer ten o'clock. It's eight o'clock. This is total bullshit! Maybe you guys should have just offered to help clean. We'd all be there. It'd be the middle of the day. What do you think is gonna happen? We'd all die in there! DIE! Bentley... Come on. Don't make me put you in the PR. Jesus! I mean John. Do something! Can't you calm Bentley down? Yes, I can. John? Great help he was. Bentley, buddy? What's it gonna be? Outside? John! Hey, buddy, where are you going? There... What are you gonna do John? Bentley, do you have faith? I... I don't know. Do I? Do you have faith? Yeah. Yes, John, I have faith. It is done. Can you believe this guy? Do you think it worked? What's Bentley doing? - Bentley, where are you going? - Wait. Let's just see what he does. I think he's lost his mind. Looks like the demon's got him now. Knighten, should we go in after him before he hurts himself. Just hold on. John has done it! The evil spirits are gone! Hallelujah and stuff! - It's been exorcised. It's been cleaned. - OK guys, I know we're all excited. But if we just wait a second... Good, good, what we got here? Drugs. More drugs. Hey, good job! Good, good, good, good! Yes, yes, yes, yes! - Good work, Renton. - Thanks, John. Well I guess I'll go cancel the cleaning company. How'd you get them to do it? Oh, it wasn't me. You can thank our resident Lord and Savior. You didn't go to town either? Everything OK? I'm content the others are enjoying themselves. I need time to... reflect. Abby... Would you sit with me? Sure. Well thank you ma'am! If you ever need your cable fixed again you give me a call, I'll swing right over. Oh my god... Where are you going? They'll hear you. So? We can't keep this thing secret forever. There is a very serious no staff fraternization policy. Serious is a loose term. Knighten... You know I can't risk it. OK. Well let me just show you how sneaky I can be then. Shh! - You're being even louder... - Shh, shh! Abby... - What? - Athena just got fired. - Just now? - Yeah. What's going on? Athena was fired? At least she's got company. Oh my god, you too? I'll be OK. Single woman in her early 50's I can start over. What happened? Just out of nowhere? Jack came in this morning with some speech about how I am incompetent and how much money I've been losing him. They're bringing in a new administration team. Good luck, Abigail... I don't like men in suits. They make me uneasy. At least they're not in lab coats. Or trench coats. Or invisible coats. We should go talk to John. He'll know what to do. Good idea. Here's your coffee. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Well I underestimated you, Abby. Very nice power play. Subtle, but effective. I guess Kurt can be useful after all. That was not what I was trying to do. It was dispicable what was going on there. Just because we're not a public company doesn't mean that we can ignore shareholders and run the business into the ground. I should have had my head examined years ago for not doing something about that place sooner. That's the thing with government subsidies, they make people lazy. Pharmaceuticals is big business... and it is hard for investors to kick in money when your doctors don't even prescribe medication. The board's been debating selling the place for years, but some of us me included, think it looks good in our portfolio. But my good nature only extends to a certain point. and Chris Stauder... He'll have that place whipped into shape in no time, I'm confident. - Jack... - Look, don't worry about it. It was bound to happen sooner or later. I mean come on, they've got some guy claiming he's Jesus treating patients... Talk about the inmates taking over the asylum. Some of the patients were benefitting from going off their medication, Jack. They were getting better. Abby, you've been around long enough to know that we make our money treating patients. A patient who is better isn't a patient anymore. Hey Bill. What's this? That, my good man, is the new asshole Director turning this place into even more of a prison. I think my days here are numbered. Don't worry about it, B. They got cameras around everywhere nowadays. It's not the cameras that scare me. It's who's watching them. Time to get to work, boys. Everyone will have a private interview with Dr. Lucas here. He's a good man. You'll like him. And just so it doesn't come as a complete surprise most of you will be going back on your meds. Complain all you want. Our medication will cure you of your problems, not some ridiculous patient using pseudoscience. I know you all have problems, but I find it difficult to believe that you all fell for this. Turning water into wine is a physical impossibility. It wasn't water into wine, stupid! Soda into whatever. It doesn't matter. He tricked you. You were fooled. He doesn't have magical powers. And, let me tell you, his so-called "helping you" ends now... You are here because you need professional help and we are the professionals. We know what's best for you. Hate us all you want, but your well-being is our only concern. And it has come to my attention that some of you have been smoking on the facility grounds. That also ends now. Interesting... You have a schizophrenic on thioridazine. You took him off of it, and you replaced it with... With what? Nothing? He wasn't responding to the thioridazine, so we attempted alternative treatment methods. Like what? The healing power of God? The patient in question was showing signs of improvement. According to this, he's also showing signs of physical violence and hallucinations. He was getting better... Dr. Lucas. And this John Doe who's clearly showing signs of something was never prescribed any medication. He was undiagnosed. Well then you diagnose him. You find out what the hell he's got. That's what a psychiatrist does. This Athena whats-her-name was clearly incompetent. Just going through these files... I'm surprised she was even licensed. He was doing well without medication. How do you know that when he was never given any? Standard procedure is to try a course of action, monitor results, and determine if a change of medication is needed. - John... - John doesn't know what's best for him. John is not in charge of his care. John thinks he's Jesus-reincarnate and clearly needs our help. There are gonna be some major changes around here, Ms. Albright. Don't be offended if I don't consult you on them. So... I'll take the third floor if you two can take floors one and two, OK? Why are you doing the schedule? Because she's the new clinical coodinator. It's not my choice, OK? ABBY! - What's going on? - They're trying to put John on drugs. And they're saying that John can't wear his robe anymore. They might even make him shave his beard! No. NO! They've crossed too many lines. They're going too far. Everyone just calm down. You could do something about it. You're an important person now, right? There's not much I can do... I'm in charge of the nursing staff, not hospital policy. What does it matter? If John has to start taking medication, shave the beard, and not wear the robe, he's still the same person. You've hated John since the day he showed up! I have not hated John. I just think he needs help. I'll see what I can do... OK? You just need more faith. It's a new medication, Grayson. It's supposed to help your lungs. But you gotta stop smoking too. Bentley, 307. How come there's three blue pills instead of two? They upped your dose. - These feel heavier... - Just take them, Bentley. John, 316. John... 316... 21, 22, 23... 23 chairs. Tell me again how we're supposed to do inventory on this shit when we don't even know what half of it's called? I don't know man, just guess. Doesn't matter. I wonder how much we can make selling this shit. Selling it? Great way to get fired. Whoa... What do you wanna call that? We have a great community. The patients here are very supportive of each other. If you were to enroll your daughter here, I am sure she would do just fine. If she... What are they doing over there? They're just... umm... They're just engaging in some self-help therapy. Like I was saying, everyone here is very supportive of each other. It... Please! Stop... Thank you. As I was saying, everyone does very well here. Why don't we head inside? John, 316 John! 316... Come with me. Here's your meds, John. Hmm? I'll take that, thank you! There is going to be a new rule around here. Any patient not taking their prescribed medication will not be receiving their meal. Got it? No meds, no food! Mr. Stauder. We aren't allowed to withold food from patients. Says who? You? Take it up with Jack. He gave me free reign around here. Tell me how starving him is supposed to help? What are you worried about? He'll be hungry by dinner and begging to take his meds. - That's not... - If you really care about this guy you'll get him to take his meds and get better. Usually, that's what nurses do. Or you could just let him be a crackpot the rest of his life. You need to relax. - He's gonna kill him. - No, he's not. Everyone just needs to chill out. Stauder's gonna realize that he can't just not feed people and John's gonna do something for himself for once. It's all gonna work out. OK? Hey... Can I see you tonight? Sure. Misty. What happened? You were doing so well. You know you were looking pretty hot. I don't give a shit. Do you wanna see my abs? No. I hate this place now. - Misty... Misty... - Can you just leave me alone! Come in. Um... Mr. Stauder, sir. I saw something scary I think I need to tell you about. And then the cop said Miranda rights... Like Miranda... The girl at the... Oh that's the joke. That's the joke. Oh right 'cause her name was, no, her name was Miranda. - Right, right, that's good! - I'm funny! Because. I know you are. What? I said it was funny. I got it. I'm serious. You're not serious. You're never serious. I'm serious about some things. Mr. Richman. Ms. Albright. I know you're in there... Shit! OK! Fun is over! Back inside. - But it's still free time... - He said inside! - Don't... Don't touch me. - Inside. It's out of my hands Ms. Albright and I do not need to explain anything to you. Just be thankful that you still have a job. The rules are very, very clear when it comes to employee fraternization. Be thankful an exception is being made. - John? - Hi Abby. Why won't you just take your medication? It's not going to hurt you. It is not my father's will. If that means I cannot eat, then so be it. I will not waiver. - What can I do? I feel... - Abby. This isn't your fault. You have no reason to feel guilty. Everything is OK. I have everything I need. I'll be fine... and you will be too. Ms. Albright! You are needed out here immediately! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! Get off! Get off of him! I'm gonna kill you! I'll sue your ass you greasy little weasel! That was my last cigarette! You shouldn't be smoking here! If you wanted to smoke, maybe you shouldn't have been locked up in here like a nutjob! I don't belong here! I'm here by mistake! Shut up or both of you are going to solitary. Bill, let's go to your room. - Get him up! - Let go of me! I need a cigarette. Well you're not getting one. Now calm down. - Something's wrong! - Shut up! - He's dying! - He might be having a heart attack! Someone call 9-1-1! Everyone just relax! Help me... What do you think you're doing? Get away from him! Throw him in his room! No one is dying on my watch! What's going on Bill? They won't discharge me. They won't let me go. Lucas and Stauder say I'm not ready. But then I saw Grayson smoking behind the building and I thought If I'm going to be locked up in here, he should too right? So I squashed his last cigarette. They have to let me go... You wanna know something? I am crazy. I don't, uhh... I don't work for a company in New York. I mean I did... But one day I had a... I don't know. They called it a... An episode. Back at the office. I almost killed a guy with a box cutter. Cut him... Shoulder to hip. I got fired of course. At least the poor bugger survived. But that was sort of the, uhh, straw that broke the camel's back you know? Wife got the kids. Knighten. Hey... It's me again. Call me back. I'm sorry, but you know I can't just leave. I can't just drop this. And I would have come with you... Anyways. Call me back if you want. OK. Bye. So he's fine. We ran some tests. There's nothing physically wrong with him. Probably just a panic attack. He had been edgy. Got into a bit of a tussle with one of the other patients. I mean... He has been a chain smoker for what? Must be 30 years? Yeah. You mentioned that and so did the EMTs. Just one thing. Purely out of curiosity. Would you guys mind coming with me for a minute? See? Look at his lungs. Perfectly healthy. Even someone who was smoking for one year would have some spots on their lungs. Grayson? Grayson Grant? I found it odd that he wasn't wheezing. Usually that'll last for a while after an attack like this and especially with a really hard smoker. I don't believe it... It works. Do you know what this means? The coffilex! We put him on it three weeks ago and look! I'm familiar with that but it's... It's new. Is it really supposed to work that quick? There's your proof right there! The panic attack was probably some sort of, I don't know, minor side effect but that is of little consequence when you have dramatic results like that! Good work! Coming? What a breakthrough. We are going to have to start working on getting these results published tomorrow Remind me to get a copy of the x-rays from the hospital. There are going to be a lot of people who are going to be very excited by this. Maybe just hold off on the publishing just yet. Why? Let me do a bit more research just to be sure there aren't any other factors involved. More research? You don't think it's the coffilex. I don't know. I guess maybe it's possible, but It never worked that fast in the clinical trials. Not even close. And it never achieved complete irradication. What else could it be? It's the only drug he's taking that isn't for his psych problems. - You've seen the x-ray... - I know, I... I don't want you to look foolish. Like if you publish something groundbreaking that ends up not being correct. Mr. Stauder? Mr. Stauder? Hey. Hey is it true that John cured Grayson's lungs? That. That means, like, we don't have to take our meds. Clearly! We don't have to take our meds if John can cure us, right? What? Yeah... Yeah. Yeah. Grayson... I've been looking for you. Do you mind if I take a seat? So. How are you feeling? I feel great. That was quite the scare you gave us. Hmm? Well, I'm glad you're feeling better. You certainly look better. The meds we've been giving you must really be doing the trick, eh? John healed me. Come on Grayson. You're not an idiot and neither am I. - You know what's going on with you... - It happened when he touched me. Because I believed. I asked. And he saved me. No. He didn't. That's impossible. The medication we gave you cured you No. It was John. Listen Grayson. The patients are on edge enough as it is. They don't need you making it worse. It was John. We can't allow you to go around telling everyone that. It was John. - Spreading ridiculous rumors - It. - which would make me - Was. - the laughing stock of professi... - John. IT WASN'T JOHN! He touched you for two god-damn seconds and you're telling me that he cured you? There are a million logical explainations for this and none of them include a ridiculous homeless man magically healing you. His name is John. Hi John. Can I come in? Maybe I overreacted. I really do care about you. I want what's best for you and I believe properly prescribed medication is the best way to heal you. But sometimes I get angry and I want to apologize for that. I want to bury the hatchet. I had this made especially for you. But John. I need you to do something for me and it's very important. And it's not for my benefit. It's for the benefit of everyone here and everyone... everywhere. You see, Grayson is under the impression that you healed him from all of his years of smoking when you touched him yesterday and I don't need to tell you that that's impossible. Now he is going around telling the patients that you are a miracle healer and that puts the patients in danger. Regardless of your stance on the meds you cannot think that that is a good idea for Grayson to be telling everyone. The patients need to believe in the meds, John. They need to believe that they can get better with things that will actually make them better. And they need to know that I can help them do that. Hmm? All things are possible with enough faith, Chris. John... You have no idea how bad I can make it for you in here. You need to tell him. Nobody gives a shit about what a bunch of psychotic mental patients think! Do you want to die in here John? You're so far down the rabbit hole that you're willing to wither away into nothingness and take all of the other patients with you? All right John. I tried to reason with you man to man... but if you don't want to listen to reason we're going to have to take a different approach. John... You are putting this whole place in jeopardy. Our careers. The facility. The other patients. And I can't allow you to do that. What's that? Outisde? I have this for you right here. I need you to take this and I need you to take this right now. OK John... Have it your way. Nurse! Nurse! I don't give a shit, Kurt. I don't care how much Good. I don't want to hear from you either until we're in court. Nurse! Nurse! Nurse! - Nurse! Nurse! - Renton! What is it? Come on! Come with me! Admit it! You are a con artist! You are a fake. You're a phony. You're a fraud. Why? Why? Why do you make me do this to you! I forgive you... Or maybe... Maybe you are an idiot! John? OK. You win this round. Come on. Wake up. We can go back inside now. John... John? John! What did you do? Can you... Can you hear me? John! Can you hear me? Wake up! Come on! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Come on! Get up! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Come on! Get up! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! THEY KILLED HIM! Hey! Yes. My name's Abby Albright. I'm a nurse at Northern Hope. I've got an unconcious man here in his early 30s. He's been repeatedly electrocuted. Where is he? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no no, no, no, John! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, John! John, don't leave me. John? John? HELP HIM! Why are you just standing there? John! Please. Come on guys... Let's go inside. Come on... Wow... I can't even imagine how that must have been. I'm glad you're back Ada. It wasn't the same without you. When I hear about what happened, I couldn't stop thinking about how mortifying it must have been for them... and how much recovery they're going to need after something like this. I was happy to come back. I know we're all... really heartbroken about what happened to John. But he wouldn't want us to be upset. He'd want us to be happy. He'd want us to thrive. He'd want us to remember him by carrying on his legacy. Let us live lives that would make him look down on us and smile. That we may endure in peace and harmony. Let us create an atmosphere of acceptance and charity, so that all who enter through these gates may also feel the love and hope... that he indeed shared with us. Ahh, Abby. Thank you for coming. Please. Sit down. Abby. We need to fire you. Fire me? Because of what happened? You were the head nurse so ultimately you were the one responsible when this unfortunate situation occured. And we need to answer for that. - Jack... I... - If they ever find this John Doe's family they'll be less likely to sue if they knew that we took the situation seriously and that we did everything that we could to purge the said responsible parties from the facility. Now luckily we had readily available staff willing to return. So... The place will be fine without you. Jack? You of all people know why I needed this job. You know my situation. I know... What am I supposed to do? Guys. This is Rita. She's the new girl and she's super super cool and she smells really nice. Welcome home. I'm Anne-Marie. If you need anything just let me know, OK? No, no! Let me know if you need anything. Hi. Bill Johnson. I'm crazy. You're back I see. Yup. That's good. I'm happy for you. Yeah, everybody's back. Got a good thing going here. So, what are you gonna do? I don't know. I think I'll stay with my sister until I get this house situation figured out. Definitely can't let him win now. Maybe you should just let him have the house. You know, get him out of your life. Clean slate and all that. I can't, Knighten. Hey. - I don't want to be hugged. - OK. I'm sure you'll do fine. Good luck. This was fun. Yeah. It was. I'll call you sometime. Sure. I think John would like it if we all ate lunch. I hope we're having spaghetti today. John? Hi Abby. John. I don't know what I'm gonna do? I'm so sorry John. I'm so sorry for everything that happened to you. - I wish I could have done something... - Abby. It wasn't your fault. You have no reason to feel guilty. But I do... I've worked so hard and I can't start over and I've tried... Abby. Sometimes you just have to let it go. But what should I do? Just tell me what I should do. Tell me what I need. Abby. Everything is OK. You have everything you need. I'll be fine. And you will be too. Taxi's running out front for you. Tell Kurt he can keep that piece of shit house. Oh Abby. If you could just sign this paperwork before you go. Sure. Thank you. - Good luck. - Thank you. What time does the movie night start? What? Bentley told me they gather once a week for movie night. Yeah. Mondays. Eight o'clock. Do you know how many hospitals I've been in? - How many? - Four! And this one's the best by far. Everybody's so nice. The patients and the staff. They've been so helpful already. We were just out in the gazebo and they were telling me the most wonderful stories. Yeah. They're a great group. It was nice to meet you. I have to go. Wait! Let me tell you about John...
