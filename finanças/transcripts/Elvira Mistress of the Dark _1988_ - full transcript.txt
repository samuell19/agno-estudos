'So that's what you look like. 'You're ugly! Horrible! 'Go on. Try your intellect on me.' 'I'll see you in hell first!' 'Stop!' 'Let's get out of here!' 'Cease firing.' - 'He acted like he knew it.' - 'He did. 'He learned almost too late that man is a feeling creature. 'And because of it the greatest in the universe. 'There is hope, but it has to come from man himself.' I have to go. I'm gonna eat now. Hold on. Just a second. 'Hello, darling. It's me again. 'Yours cruelly, Elvira. 'The gal with the enormous... uh, ratings. Hmm. 'Well, that's our show. 'I hope you enjoyed watching it as much as I did.' Oh, boy. I mean, could you believe that cheesy-looking monster? Looked like Gumby on steroids. Well, at least the movie had a moral. Where's the shrimp? Are you ready for the news? Does anybody know what that movie was about? Uh, I'll tell you what it was about. It was about an hour and half too long! - Cut. - Hmm. Oh... And, uh, don't forget next week, it's "The Head with Two Things"... Uh, I mean, "The Thing with Two Heads". And until then this is Elvira, the gal who put the boob back into boob tube, saying unpleasant dreams. - Got the news in one minute. - Very nice. Hey! Put me down, will ya? How do you expect me to fix your hair...? Oh, idiot! Is there anything that could possibly shame you? Yeah. Wearing this in a public place might do it. Ha! Get it, girlfriend! You got your news and counting? - Elvira. - Not now, Rudy. Wait a sec, wait a sec. See, see that guy over there? What, the lard bucket in the ten-gallon hat? Yes, that's the station new owner. From the edge of the sea to the end of the valley... - You what? - Shut up! Relax, relax. This guy's a millionaire, OK? Mr. Hooter... ...this is, uh, Elvira. Name's Earl, but the ladies back home call me Longhorn. Maybe you can guess why. Gee, I... I don't know. Does it have anything to do with your breath? Why don't we let this little filly get herself gussied up? And... ...the sooner I get in the saddle, the better. Well, sorry, partner. But it looks like it's gonna be you and your trusty old right hand. Sounds like you're looking to get yourself fired, little lady. Huh! Go ahead and fire me. I need this job like a leper needs a three-way mirror! It just so happens I have an act opening up in Las Vegas. Oh, terrific. You can try your act out on me. It's milkin' time! That's it! I'm walkin'! I don't have to take this from anybody! And as for you, you cretinous cowpoke... Whoa! She's got Hooter! Somebody on the floor, get her out of there. ...within so much as ten feet of me and I'm gonna tie your weenie in a granny knot! Whoa! You said she was a nympho. Come on, will you? Not the ball game! Oh! - You can't quit! - What's the big deal? As soon as my show opens in Las Vegas, I never have to host one of those crap horror movies again. - There's no problem with the show? - Problem? Complications maybe, but never a problem. All right. Out with it, Manny. OK. The Flamingo won't... ...won't go ahead with the show unless you come up with some money. - Well, how much do they want? - 50,000 dollars. 50,000 dollars? Are you nuts? Where am I gonna come up with that kind of money? Maybe it's not too late to get your job back. Forget it, Manny. I'm never working for that sleazeball again! I'll just have to find another sleazeball. - Ooh! - A telegram for Miss Elvira. I'll take it. "Dear Elvira, as executor of the estate of your great-aunt, Miss Morgana Talbot, "I'm sorry to inform you of her un... timely passing." Whoa! I didn't even know I had a good aunt, much less a great one. Let me see that. Says here all I have to do is come to Fallwell, Massachusetts, for the reading of the will and I'll pick up my inheritance! Is that timing or what? "And lastly to my enchanting niece Elvira, "who has unflinchingly withstood "the slings and arrows of an imperfect world "without so much as a whimper or a complaint..." Mm. ...I bequeath my entire fortune." Oh. Let's show Elvira exactly what she's inherited! Elvira, you are going to start with something that dreams are made of. A beautiful new sailboat! You're going to sail away in a sporty Sunchaser II from Snark. And that's not all. When you're tired of sailing, you'll drive home in this brand-new Jeep Wrangler! I needed one of those! And you'll sit down to dinner at this beautiful ten-piece dining-room suite from American Heritage. And top... and top of all of that... ...money! Lots and lots of money! Elvira? Elvira, are you all right? Hm. Go ahead and call The Flamingo, Manny. Tell 'em I'll have that 50 grand as soon as I get back from Massachusetts.

Listen, young lady, I don't know who you are or where you came from, but you most certainly don't fit in this town. Why, you don't even fit in that dress. Listen, sister, if I want your opinion, I'll beat it out of ya. Anita! Anita! It's the Antichrist, I tell you. The Antichrist! Can someone tell me where there's a garage around here? Yeah, yeah. There's one right up the street. Oh. Well, uh, would one of you big strong men mind give me a little push? Easy, easy. Don't scratch the paint. She's incredible. And what I wouldn't do for just one peek at those gazongas. They're unreal! Oh, great! That means I'm stuck in this hellhole! I mean, this quaint little hellhole. Uh, listen, is there a motel or somethin' around here? Well, there's the Cozy Cot down by the widow Bishop's feed store. Of course, her son sort of took that over after she had that spell of gingivitis. Her whole mouth swole up. It looked like she ate a box of staples. Folks were saying she got it from kissin' that old dog of hers. Nice tits. Yoo-hoo! Can I have a room? Sorry. We're booked solid. So how it come it says "vacancy" out there? Look, we do have a room. Remember the trucker with the bad skin that checked out this morning? Eew. I hope you changed the sheets. Hi. Is that makeup I see on your face, young lady? Hm... No, ma'am. I mean, yes, ma'am. Well, just a little. How many times have I told you? You're too young to wear makeup. - No, Mother, I don't see the harm... - Shut up, Leslie! Grandma, all the other girls at school are wearing makeup. Well, if all the other girls at school jumped off a cliff, would you jump off a cliff? You don't have the sense that you were born with! You have... I hate to interrupt this little episode of "The Waltons" but could I get a room? OK, but it's cash upfront. I know what you pinko, heavy metal weirdos do to motel rooms. Read all about it in "The Star". I'll, uh, I'll show the lady to her room. Oh, no, you don't! Hey, don't let them get you down. I used to get the same line about makeup from the nuns at the orphanage. Of course, I was only eight. Uh... I'm Elvira. I'm Robin. So, um, Robin, what's there to do for fun around here, anyway? - Hmm. This town isn't real big on fun. - Hm. Well, there is one place that's open. The bowling alley. That gets real wild on League Night. Gee, I think I can handle it. Oh, I am so sure. They must think we're really stupid. They're gonna kill Spider-Man with plutonium? He's got radioactive blood. Yeah? Let me see that. - Hey, man. What did you do that for? - Shut up! Look at what just walked in. Ooh, uh, Bloody Mary. No hard liquor served past eight o'clock. Do you want a Virgin? Uh, maybe, but, uh, I'll have a couple of drinks first. Mm. Uh. Hey, baby. I got somethin' to show you. Sorry. Left my magnifying glass at home. Hey, that's pretty good. Billy... that is no way to talk to a lady. So... how about a blowjob? Ah... I bet you think that was pretty funny, don't ya? I enjoyed it. Yeah? You're gonna enjoy this even more. - Uh, uh, uh. - I'll cut you, man! Oh! She stabbed me! - Faked ya out. - Yeah, well, this ain't fake, baby! So stand still cos I'm gonna... I'm gonna... Um, my name is Elvira, but you can call me... tonight. Hmm. I'm Bob. Bob Redding. Pleased to meet you. Look at this mess. Who the heck is gonna pay for it? It's all right, Patty. I'll take care of the damages. Seems to me it's all this cheap little tart's fault. Cheap? Who are you calling cheap? What's that perfume you're wearing? Catch of the day? Look, honey, I don't know which hole you crawled out of, but I suggest you crawl right back in if you know what's good for you. Yeah, you better watch out. You could put somebody's eyes out with them things. Hmm. - Break it up. - We better go. It looks like you've got some competition, Patty. Charlie, trash does not compete with class. Right down the street at the Cozy Cot. Oh. So, what brought you to Fallwell? Um, my car. No, I'm here for the reading of my great-aunt Morgana's will. Morgana Talbot? She's your aunt? Yeah, came as a surprise to me too. I never really knew her, but I sure admired her spunk. She never caved in the way everybody else in this town has. Well, I don't wanna bore you with local politics. Go ahead. Bore me. OK, we've got this town council that lives in mortal fear that somewhere, somehow, somebody in Fallwell's having a good time. Oh. Bunch of real preservatives, huh? Oh. - I run the movie house. - Oh, really? I'm in movies too! Have you ever shown, uh, um, "I Married Satan"? No. How about the sequel, "I Married Satan 2?" No. Uh... Hm. I, uh... I can only play G-rated movies. Oh, well, there's nothing wrong with G-rated movies, as long as there's lots of sex and violence. Um, hey, listen, Bob. Hmm. I'm only gonna be in town for a couple of days and... I can't think of anyone who I'd rather squeeze into my... ...agenda. Gee, that'd be swell. Oh, Mr. Talbot. Your sister was like a mother to me. She was a mother to me too, dear. Well, now that we've dispensed with the obligatory display of bereavement, you may begin the proceedings, Mr. Bigelow. Uh, it was Mrs. Talbot's wish to have all of her relatives present for the reading of the will. All of her relatives are present, me, myself and I. Well, apparently, Mrs. Talbot has a grand-niece, Elvira, who was also one of the beneficiaries. - That's impossible. - Uh, uh, well... Who is this grand-niece? Hey, guys! Sorry I'm late, but then so's my aunt! Hey, what she die of? Nothing serious I hope. Say, nice jacket. Who shot the couch? Hey, is there a bathroom around here? I'm telling you the toilet over the Cozy Cot looks like somebody's science project. Who is this woman? This must be Mrs. Talbot's grand-niece. Uh, Elvira, this is your great-aunt's brother, Vincent Talbot. She was my aunt and you're her brother. Then you must be my Uncle Vinnie! Get this woman off of me! Oh, and you must be Auntie Em and Uncle Remus. Oh! There's no place like home! There's no place like home! Hurry up, Bigelow. Let's get on with it! Yeah, really. Let's get going before somebody else dies! Ooh. Hm, uh, "This is the certified and only last will and testament "of the deceased Morgana Talbot. "To my housekeeper, Mrs. Morrissey, for years of loyalty and devotion, "I leave my silver tea service and a cash allotment of 5,000 dollars." Oh. Hey, babe, what you whining about? You made out like a bandit. "To Mr. Morrissey, my driver, "I leave my automobile and an allotment of 5,000 dollars." Whoa, dude! Ten grand just for the help? Ha! That old gal must have really been loaded! Oh, I mean, dear sweet Aunt Morgana certainly was generous. What's it say about me? What I get? What I get? What I get? Uh... - "To my grand-niece Elvira..." - Come on. Lay it on me, Aunt Morgana. Big bucks! Big bucks! Uh, uh... Uh, uh, "I bequeath my house, my beloved poodle, Algonquin "and my precious book of recipes." That's it? A house, a dog and a book? Please, if you will allow me to finish. "And finally, to my dear brother, Vincent, "I leave the rest of my estate and holdings "of which there is none." Hm. Where's the cash? Where's the furniture? Where's Bob Eubanks? He wasn't mentioned. I don't get it, man, uh, boss. What's so important about a dumb recipe book? That dumb recipe book contains more power than your feeble little minds can ever imagine. And it rightfully belongs to me. I must have that book. Great! Just what I need, a house. I need a house in Fallwell, like I need a padded bra! I can't live here! I'll go crazy, I tell you! Get... Oh... Crazy! - May I offer you a ride? - Buzz off, creep! I'm not in the mood! - Oh, it's you, Uncle Vinnie! - Yes! Uncle Vinnie. I must apologise for my behaviour in the office. It's just that your appearance was a bit of a shock to me. It's OK. My appearance is kind of a shock to everybody. Yes, well, as you may have surmised, my sister and I, well... let's just say we... had our differences. Yeah, I guess. You really got shafted. Uh, look, I'll tell you what, Uncle Vinnie, um, I'll share my inheritance with you. - You can have the dog. - No! Thank you. But I would be interested in acquiring that recipe book. You know, for sentimental reasons. I'd be willing to pay you. Say, 50 dollars. Hey, sure! I'll do it for fifty bucks. Oh! Vinnie, you got yourself a cookbook. That lawyer guy is taking me over to the house, so you can pick up it later. Fine. I'll see you there. - Oh, uh, don't forget to bring the cash. - Mm-hm. Drive! If one of those bottles should happen to fall... Oh, we're here. Wait up! Hey, this place ain't half bad! Bet you could get a bundle for it. Yes, you could, but your house is over there. Ooh, Mr. Talbot! I wanted to thank you for that generous donation you made to the Morality Club. - You're quite welcome. - As I always say, morals aren't cheap. And speaking of cheap, uh, a little birdy told me - that Elvira woman is related to you. - Mm. Now, not that it's any of my business, but then, 'course, everything is. Believe me, I'm as anxious to get rid of her as you are. Oh, good! You know, because someone like that comes to town, the next thing you know they're teaching sex education in the schools and they're passing out condoms to kindergartners. You remember when those swarthy fellas... She won't be with us very long. Oh. Um... Uh, why, uh... Ah, well, I know I'm needed somewhere. Chastity Pariah can do. Bye-bye now. Careful. Some of the boards are loose. What a dump! Like I said, the house needs a little something. Yeah! Like a wrecking ball. I think Algonquin likes you. Oh... Here, doggie. Go on. Go chase this into the street. I can't stand little dogs. Boy, if my aunt wasn't dead, I'd kill her! Oh. Sorry, Aunt Morgana. Just... kidding. Mm-hm. Here's the rest of your inheritance. Your great-aunt's recipe book. Oh, yeah, some inheritance. Well, at least I'm getting 50 bucks for it. Say, how much you think I can get for this place? Well, even though the house is in disrepair, it is in a prime location. I'd venture to say you could get, uh, 70,000. - 70 grand? - Maybe more, if it were fixed up. - Would you be interested in selling? - Does a chicken have a pecker? 'Course I'm interested! Now, what am I gonna do with you? That's more like it, Algonquin. Algonquin... What a sissy name. Let's see. What do I call ya? I know! Gonk. How do you like that? Yeah, hold your horses. Hi, Uncle Vinnie! You're here for the book, right? Come on in! Can I make you a cup of tea or somethin'? I wouldn't want to put you to any trouble. Mm. Good point. I can't stay very long, anyway. Say, you don't wanna buy a house, would ya? - I'm afraid not. - I'll sell it to you cheap. Uh, no, thank you. They don't make houses like this any more. I mean, look at that detailing. Look at the craftsmanship! Uh... What would you pay for a house like this? Don't answer because you not only get a house. If you act right now, you also get all this beautiful furniture! Now what would you pay? I'm telling you it's a jewel box. It's a gem, a love hutch for two. I'll bend over backwards to make you a deal. I'll bend over forwards... I'd stand on my head and... No! Just the book! OK. I mean, if you're gonna get crabby about it... That's weird. I would have sworn the book was just on that table. You promised me that book! Hey, don't get your panties in a bunch. It didn't just walk away. I'm sure it'll turn up. Yes! Of course, it will. Forgive me. Hmm. Thinks he's a pitbull. Good thing I'm not gonna be here very long. The neighbours would never get any sleep. Ah! About time, doofus. Did you bring the camera? - Do I look like an idiot? - Want me to answer that? Shut up, you guys! She's gonna hear us. Mirror, mirror, on the wall, who's the most drop-dead gorgeous one of all? Oh, you're just saying that. Hmm. Crap. - What do you see? - In a minute, in a minute. Ow! My fingers. - Guys, I can't see... - In a minute. Wait. God, it's cold out. Whoa. Don't drop it. Ow, ow. Ow! Let me see. Awesome! Whoa! I got ya. Did you get it? Bo! Haven't you boys got some place else to hang around? Uh, we heard you might need a little help fixing up the place. Hmm. That's very thoughtful, but why don't you come back when the light's better? Good night! - You blew it! - Did you see those gazongas? - Some. - I got it! - Great! - All right! 'Elvira. 'Elvira. 'Elvira. 'Elvira.' Oh, out, out, out! Out! - Hi, Elvira. - Hi. Oh, hi.

There she was parading around in clothes that couldn't keep a titmouse dry in a drizzle. I mean, it was next to nothin'! I'd say it was next to plenty. And she had half the teenagers in town writhing around to that jungle music! And this morning on my regular tour of the boys lavatory I confiscated this! Hm. I'll be making the announcement this afternoon. Henceforth, all students will be subject to immediate expulsion if there are found in the company of that floozy! Please, I don't think we need to resort to name-calling. I think what Calvin is trying to say is that this Elvira is a person of easy virtue, a purveyor of pulchritude, one woman's Sodom and Gomorrah, if you will. A slimy, slithering succubus, a concubine, a street walker, a tramp, a slut, a cheap whore! She'll be nothing but a bad dream just as soon as she sells that property. An open house has been planned for tomorrow. But what if she decides not to sell? What if she decides to settle here? Well, if she is morally unfit, then we have every right to do anything we can to get her out of this town. - Are we agreed? - Absolutely. Maybe we're not being entirely objective about this. Shut up, Leslie! Then it's unanimous. Harold Glotter, Fallwell Real Estate. Well, I sure hope you got a buyer. I haven't had so much as a lookie-loo. Don't worry. I have some wealthy investors friends who'd buy this house in a minute. That is... if you play your cards right. Oh! Honey, I'd do anything to get rid of this rat trap. Hm. That's what I like, a motivated seller. It's all a matter of technique. For starters, let's try and... ...set the proper mood. Oh, good idea. Hmm. I mean, the less they see, the better. Then it's usually a matter of getting close to the buyer. Tell him all about the potential appreciation. Then guide him through every nook and cranny. Slowly unveil everything from the balcony to the basement. One area at a time. When he's so enthralled, he's ready to burst, you... clinch the deal! Ow! You'll be sorry! You'll never sell this place without me! Just because this house is up for grabs doesn't mean I am! Ah! Get this dog off! Ah! Get back! Get outta here! "Calm down, Manny", she says! I've got the Flamingo breathing down my neck to cough up the dough and you're telling me to calm down? I told ya, I'll come up with the money. Heck, I was just... six inches from selling this house today. Look, kid, you better get that money here pronto or you're through. Do you hear me?

Well, it must have been the size of a water buffalo. Quiet! Now, listen to me very carefully. Go to the courthouse and remove all the records of the town ordinances and bring them back to me.

Elvira, I'm sorry. - Are you all right? - Yeah, I think so. - How's your head? - I haven't had any complaints yet. Excuse me? Oh, I'll live. Believe me, it's not the worst thing that's happened to me today. I mean, every place in this town and no one will give me a job! It's... it's like it's a conspiracy or something. You know what your problem is? Chastity Pariah. Ooh, I thought that cleared up. No! Chastity Pariah. She's the old biddy. She's got the whole town turned against you. Oh, swell! So now no one will hire me and I'm flat busted! Uh, no, I mean I'm broke. I'd hire you if I could, but I'm barely make enough money to stay in business as it is. Duh! I'm not surprised. I mean, who wants to pay to see some quack making duck calls? And, besides that, Bob, you got an extra "E" in "matinée". No, I don't. That's how you spell it. Uh, Bob, I'm in show business. I think I know how to spell "matinée". - Well, I think it's a good idea. - Mm. Oh, Bob, how can I ever repay you? Here. Let me try. That witch! I... I guess I better get back to work. Uh, the matinée's gonna start soon. Mm. Oh, yeah. I can see the crowds lining up now. Bobby, baby, you are gonna go broke showing turkeys like these. You gotta a better idea? It just so happens that I have some of the classic films of all time in the trunk of my car. As a matter of fact... He who holds the book of sight, when the moon is drained of all its light, will then be ruler of the night, Master of the Dark! The lunar eclipse, Morgana. It's less than a week away. When the moon is drained of all its light... There is nothing you can do! You're dead and I'm not! Oh! There you are! I have been looking all over for you guys. You are not gonna believe the good news. Yours truly is hosting a special midnight screening at Bob's theater of one of the worst movies ever made! I mean, it is bad. You know, like bad as in bad! Like, "I'm bad, Jamal, you know it." Hey, what is this? "Invasion of the Body Snatchers"? Two days ago we were bosom buddies. It's the principal. Darn right it's the principle. Friends ought to stick together. No. I mean, the principal, Mr. Cobb. He'd kill us if we went to your show. Not to mention our parents. Kill your parents too? No, our parents would never let us stay out that late. Oh. Hmm. I see. Well, the last thing I wanna do is get you guys in any trouble. I mean, so what if it blows my only chance at making a living? I mean, that's not your problem. Hmm. And if I get so depressed, I... wind up hanging myself in the oven? Heck! Those are the breaks. But if they ever ask about me, tell 'em I was more than just a great set of boobs. I was also an incredible pair of legs. And tell 'em, tell 'em that I never turned down a friend. I... never turned down a stranger, for that matter. And tell 'em, tell 'em that when all is said and done, I only ask that people remember me by two simple words. Any two, as... long as they're simple. If we all decide to help Elvira, what can Cobb do? He can expel us all. I do not know about the rest of you, but I'll be there. - Me too. - Count on me. We're sorry, Elvira. We'll all come to your show. Great. 12 o'clock sharp. Be there or be square. Shh. Oh, that looks great! - You really like it? - Yeah. - Elvira, where do you want this? - Um, just right up there. - OK. - What's the bucket for? I tell you, oh, it's so cool! This is the part that I ripped off, uh, um... Was inspired by "Flashdance". I reach up, I pull this rope and my entire body is covered in gold glitter! - Couldn't you die? - All right! Oh, Bob, I'm telling you, it's a guaranteed standing ovulation. You're late. When the guy gets purée. Don't worry. They're Italian. They'll wind up making a great marinara sauce. Robin? Is that you? Man! Oh, this is where the heroine gets grabbed by the tomatoes! I can't watch! Boy, this ending's so bad, the tomatoes ought to start throwing rotten people at the screen. Hey, darlings, don't move because the best is yet to come. Ladies and Dobermans, it's time for the grand finale! ♪ Just a steel town girl on a Saturday night ♪ Lookin' for the fight of her life ♪ In the real-time world no one sees her at all ♪ They all say she's crazy ♪ Locking rhythms to the beat of her heart ♪ Changing movement into light ♪ She has danced into the danger zone ♪ When the dancer becomes a dance ♪ It can cut you like a knife ♪ If the gift becomes the fire ♪ On a wire between will and what will be ♪ She's a maniac, maniac on the floor... ♪ Patty! Ugh! Ugh, I have never been so humiliated in my entire life! Huh... Just wait until I get my hands on that Patty. I am gonna rip every single bleach-blonde hair out of her scalp, gouge out her eyeballs and use her head for a bowling ball! I'm telling you, they are not gonna get away with it! That... that barfman Chastity blacklisting me out of a job and that... that sleazoid of a high-school principal turning all the kids against me. And that bench-sniffin' real estate letch, trying to get his commission in the sack! I'll get even with every one of 'em, if it's the last thing I do! - What's that perfume your wearing? - Super unleaded. Don't smoke. Well, here's to my big opening! I mean... Forget it. Uh... Don't you kids think it's past your bed time? Hmm. Oh, heck, no. I'm not tired... ouch. It is getting awfully late. Uh, yeah. We better be going. Yep. Well, see you dudes tomorrow. Ow! There's the darn recipe book! How did it get under there? Uh, that reminds me. I'm starving. Mm, me too. Hmm. Uh, let's go get somethin' to eat. There's an all-night truck stop on the interstate. No, no, no, no, Bob. I've got a better idea. Why don't you set the table, while I see what I can whip up in the kitchen? My aunt sure had lousy penmanship. I can't read a word of this stuff. It looks like it was written in some foreign language or somethin'. Hm. Hm, hm. Hey, wait. Look at this. "Adraka Kazorol". Kazorol... Oh, casserole! Mm, that sounds good. OK. Let's see. What does it say here? "One edrazeba." Huh. Wonder where she keeps edrazeba around here. Wow! This is some spice rack. Tramazol. Folemgra. Kuderox. Oh! Here it is! Edrazeba. Hm, hm. One edrazeba. OK! One half folemgra. Oh... Whoa! Looks like the folemgra went bad. I don't know, it says it's good until June of next year. What the heck! I got a cast-iron stomach. OK, then. Let's see. Two to three guletra. Guletra... La, la... Uh, let's see. One kuderox. Kuderox. Where could it be? Mm. It doesn't smell too bad. But it looks like kaka-doodoo. There! That's much better. It's soup! Mmm. Smells great. What is it? Oh, just a little something I conjured up. Oh. - Allow me. - Thank you ever so. Well, I hope you're hungry. Cos here's dinner! Ugh! Get out! Ugh! Out, out! The switch! Bob, the switch! Eew! Eew! First time I was ever an appetizer for the main course. Where'd you learn how to cook? I didn't. I just followed the directions in my aunt's... Gonk, what are you doing? Gimme that cookbook! Gonk? Gonk! Gonk, you get back here right now or you are grounded for one week. Gonk! - Oh! - Gonk, come here! Déjà vu. Wow. Gonk? Gonk, are you in here? Gonk, you are very bad, bad dog. Oh, yuck! He's slobbered all over it. Now what do you want? I think he wants you to open the trunk. Well, why didn't you just say so? Wow! Look at all this cool junk! This could be you, Gonk. Eew! I think I used go out with this guy. Hey, look at this. Think it's for me? Go ahead. Open it. Uh-uh. You open it. "Dearest, Elvira. "For all these years I protected you from the truth, "but the time has now come when your only protection is the truth." Say what? Let me see this. "Your mother, Devana, "was an extraordinary woman. "She was the true Mistress of the Dark. "But her power did not go unchallenged." 'For 300 years your great-uncle Vincent 'coveted her dominion.' 300? God, I hope I look that good when I'm that old. 'He would have destroyed you, as he did her, 'had I not sent you away. 'I left you with all the power you would need to protect yourself 'and entrusted you to my loyal familiar.' What's that about a familiar? Bob, haven't you ever seen any old Roger Corman movies? Every witch has one. They're like a pet that can change into almost anything. Where was I? Oh, yeah. Um... "But it wasn't you alone that I sought to protect, "it was the book that contained your mother's magic." 'Our enemy is a formidable one. 'Protect the book, Elvira. 'And above all keep it from Vincent 'when the moon falls under the Earth's shadow. 'Remember, you carry the power with you. 'Your loving aunt, Morgana.' Too macabre! I knew I was different, but I didn't think I was quite that different. No wonder Vinnie had such a spaz attack when I couldn't find the book! Yeah, you heard what your aunt said. He can't get his hands on it. No way he's gettin' it now. I mean, here I am knocking myself out to make a living as a horror hostess when I'm actually descended from, like, a major metaphysical celebrity! Oh, all I have to do is just find the right spell and I can make the money I need for Vegas. I mean, really make the money. Uh, I don't think you should go foolin' with that book again. Bob, here it is! "Selzba Riki Moola!" This exactly what I need. Lots o' moola. OK, OK. Selzba riki moola sheen. Hey, Elvira, I... I don't think... Pasera floctum kezrah flome! It's, it's working, Bob! It's, it's working! - Bob, are you still here? - Right here! What is this? Oh. Why, Bob! You know, Bob, I may be wrong, but I think that might have been a love spell. Really? Oh, Bob! Bob. Hold me, Bob. Hold me. Stand up. Up. Chastity, the picnic's a great success. Yes, I think it's something we can all be proud of. Come and get it. Ooh. Now, you children, you're acting like wild animals. Get to the end of the line now. It all looks so good! I can't remember when I've been this hungry. - Mmm... - Ooh, Melody. I see you've made your famous Tic Tac pie. Bob, what are you doing? - You scared the hell out of me! - What's going on? Let's just say I'm settling the score. Oh, no! Well, it is a pot luck. And when they open that pot they're gonna need all the luck they can get. Oh, I don't believe I've had any of this. Revenge is better than Christmas. I don't get it. What happened? Looks like some sort of casserole. Mmm. Ooh! This is marvelous. I must get this recipe. Mmm! Oh, shoot! I must've screwed it up when I substituted the falengra with some Hamburger Helper. Oh, yes. Thank you for my drink. There. Ah! Ooh. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm-mmm. I feel a little odd. Suddenly it's very warm. ♪ I put a spell on you... Remind you of anything? ♪ Because you're mine... Remind you of anything? Mmm. Give me that! It's mine! - All mine. Oh, darling. Ooh. Mmm. Mmm. Oh, boy, am I a horn dog? ♪ Because you're mine... ♪ Excuse me. Is this space taken? Come on, stud. Let's boogie. Bob... Hey! Let's mambo! Charge! That's an interesting dish. Where did you learn how to make it? Oh, it's just a old family recipe. All right. I'll give you 500 dollars for the book. What, do I look like I just fell off the tuna truck? The deal's off, Uncle! You think you're pretty clever, don't you? - Mm. - Well, mark my words, I'll get you and your little dog too! Ugh. Help. No! Oh, you again? Do you always wear the same dress? No. Sometimes I like to wear somethin' low-cut and sexy. Huh. Well, I guess in your business it pays to advertise. Come here, Bob. Let me show you how a real woman does it. Mmm-mmm. Excuse me! You all saw it! He attacked me in broad daylight and he had his way with me! Me? I barely got away with my life. You could have worn out a mechanical bull! Ooh! You're not gonna get away with this, you sex-addled maniac! I demand that the council remove this pervert! I never laid a hand on those sheep, so help me. Calvin was the one who was painting everybody with apple butter. I was just an innocent on-licker. Silence! Don't you see? You're playing right into her hands. It's Elvira who is responsible for all this. Of course. I should have known it was that little harlot. We ought to ride her out of town on a big fat rail. She might enjoy that too much. There is a much more satisfactory solution. We can have her arrested. Arrested? On what charges? It's so happens that there is a law on the books that dates back to the Salem trials. It's specifically forbids and I quote, "Any town's person from practicing the ancient arts of spell casting, "demonology, alchemy and conjuration." The charge, my fellow council members, is... ...witchcraft. Let me outta here! Let me outta here! Pipe down in there! Hey, I've seen the "People's Court". I'm entitled to one phone call and a strip search. Well, there's a payphone right across the street. What's the matter? You forget where you put your broom? Listen, fatso, if I had a broom, I know exactly where I'd put it! Oh, this is swell! I can just hear Manny now. "Hello, Vegas! We got a slight crimp in the plans for the show. "Yeah, the star was burned at the stake." Elvira... great news. I got you the best lawyer in the county. He'll be here first thing in the morning. Bob, in the morning? First thing in the morning I'll be able to fit in an ashtray! - You gotta get me outta here. - But how? The book! It's my only chance. - Quick! Run to the house and get it! - OK. Oh, and, Bob, wait! What? I hid it under the floorboard in the living room. OK. Oh, and, Bob... - What? - Hurry! Hey, move! Get down low. Now. What are you whining about? I'm the one getting barbecued. Oh. Sorry. At last it's mine. The power is mine! Gonk, don't have a conniption fit. Whoa. It must have done too much antacid in the '60s. Four, six, eight, who do we incinerate? Elvira! Elvira! Elvira! Thank goodness, Padre! I am here to save you, my child. At last, someone who can talk some sense into these people. Lord, save this wretched creature's soul! Even though her creamy white flesh will burn and sizzle. Well, isn't that convenient? Thanks for trying, you guys. Elvira! Gonk? Is that you, boy? Good work, Gonk. Burn the witch! Burn the witch! Burn the witch! Burn the witch... Do you smoke? Guess we'll find out soon enough. Burn the witch! Burn the witch! Burn the witch! Burn the witch! Out of the way! Burn the witch! Burn the witch! Burn the witch! Burn the witch! Burn the witch! Burn the witch! Burn the witch! Burn the witch! Burn the witch! Burn the witch! Burn the witch! Burn the witch! Oh, no! You're not gonna believe this! - I left my oven on. I'll be a minute. - Oh! Burn the witch! Burn the witch! Burn the witch! Burn the witch! Burn the witch! Burn the witch! Burn the witch! Burn the witch! Any last words? Uh, just one. Help! Burn the witch! Burn the witch! Burn the witch! Burn the witch! Hold it! Hold it down! Quiet! Quiet! And now by the power vested in me by the sovereign state of Massachusetts, I do hereby pronounce sentence on Elvira, the prisoner. Death by fire! Hold it, Sheriff. What you're doing is wrong. Patty? It'll catch faster, if you light it in several places. Patty, no! We ought to have one of these every year! - Burn in hell, witch! - Patty! Burn the witch! Burn the witch! Burn the witch! Burn the witch! Burn the witch! Burn the witch! Burn the witch! Burn the witch... Burn her! Bye, kids. It's been swell. Just send my ashes to Las Vegas. Let me through! - Elvira! - Bob! - Hi, Bob. - Patty... You're not a very nice person. Burn the witch! Burn the witch! Burn the witch! Burn the witch... Gonk? 'Remember, you carry the power with you.' The ring! Are you all right? Look, the lunar eclipse. Remember? Your aunt's letter. "When the moon falls under the Earth shadow..." - Yeah, so? - Vincent's got the book! Elvira! Elvira! Gonk! Where is Gonk? You tricky little devil! Oh! Vincent, remember us? We're on your side. Swine! Stay back. Sic him, Gonk! Don't make me use this! The amulet could not protect your mother and it won't save you. Kaldozar ipsole. Oh. So you wanna play rough, eh? Well, take this! Huh? What? Uh... You cannot escape me, daughter of Devana. I shall destroy you as I did her. Are you looking for me? Did you think you could stop me with your toys? No, but I figured it'd be worth a shot. Look! Cosa! Terra! Obtan! Sure, that's easy for you to say. Ooh! That hurts! Now, baby. Hey. We have a little unfinished business. Yeah, well, uh... I think we could do business, uh... Uh, yeah, sure. I can dig it. Uh, I'm cool, bro. You know, what it is. Where it's at. Uh... I'll show you where it's at. I am Master of the Dark! Then I'll see you in hell first. And now, Elvira, you die! 'Remember, you carry the power with you.' So what did the insurance guy say? My policy doesn't cover acts of demons. Well, at least you still got the ring. Yeah, but the only thing I can get it to do any more is look cheap. Gosh, Elvira, I'm sorry. I know you had your heart set on playing Las Vegas. I'm just not the kind of girl whose dreams come true. I do better on nightmares. I wish there was something I could do. Yeah, don't worry about me, Bob. I'm like fake fruit. I don't bruise that easy. There he is, up there. Uh-oh. Here comes the lynch mob. Hey, take it easy, take it easy. I'm leaving. - We don't want you to go. - No, no. This is our way of saying we were wrong about you and we're sorry. Elvira, you're the best thing that ever happened to our town. You've touched a part of my son that... that nobody's ever touched before. I wish. As long as you're in Fallwell you will always have a free room at the Cozy Cot. Aw! Wait! Just a minute, Leslie! Shut up, you old bag. Well, I finally got it running. Great! At least now I'll have a place to live. But I still don't know how I'm gonna pay you for it. Don't worry. We'll work out something. Elvira... I'm, uh... I'm s... sorry that I set you on fire and everything and, uh... I hope there are no hard feelings. Don't worry. She's bigger than that. Yeah, a lot bigger. Elvira, I've got some important papers that you're gonna have to sign. With your uncle gone you're the only heir to his estate. - I am? - Not an inconsiderable one at that. Las Vegas! Elvira, that's fantastic! Las Vegas! Las Vegas! Las Vegas!
