WELL, WHAT DID HE SAY? THE PAWNBROKER WAS OUT, SO I TALKED TO HIS WIFE. YOU KNOW, SHE CAN SPEAK ENGLISH, FRENCH, AND SPANISH? OH, NEVER MIND THAT. WHAT DID SHE SAY? SHE SAID "NO," IN 3 DIFFERENT LANGUAGES. A FINE WAY TO TREAT A STEADY CUSTOMER. I DO ALL MY PAWNING THERE. YOU GOT A CIGARETTE, RENE? YEAH. I HATE TO BREAK UP YOUR COLLECTION. MONTMARTRE, ONE OF THE OLDEST AND MOST DISTINCTIVE QUARTERS OF PARIS. MANY FAMOUS PAINTERS AND SCULPTORS HAD THEIR STUDIOS IN MONTMARTRE, WHICH OCCUPIES A COLORFUL PLACE IN FRENCH HISTORY. OH, MYRTLE, MYRTLE, DON'T READ IT. VISUALIZE IT. FOR ALL WE KNOW, EMILE ZOLA SAT RIGHT THERE WHERE YOU'RE SITTING, TALKING TO PAUL CEZANNE. AND MAYBE NAPOLEON WATERED HIS HORSE RIGHT HERE. THERE COMES LOUIS PASTEUR, LAUGHED AT BY ALL THE PEOPLE WHO CALLED HIM A FOOL. OH, LISTEN. LISTEN, MYRTLE. THE SACRE COEUR. OH, IT'S GETTING LATE, MISS WINTERS. YOU HAVE AN 8:00 DINNER DATE WITH LADY MALVERTON AT THE RIVOLI BAR. YES, I KNOW. WHAT TIME? 8:00 AT THE RIVOLI BAR. I WISH LADY MALVERTON WOULD LEAVE ME ALONE. I WISH LADY MALVERTON WOULD LEAVE ME ALONE. WHY DOESN'T SHE GO-- BACK TO LONDON AND TAKE ALONG HER NIECE JILL. AND HAVE YOU EVER SEEN HER NICE JILL? DON'T FORGET. A LOT OF JACK GOES WITH THAT JILL. ALL RIGHT, MOTHER GOOSE. AND NOW YOU GO BACK TO THE HOTEL, MYRTLE. I'LL SEE YOU LATER. I WANT TO WALK AROUND AND TAKE IN SOME MORE OF THIS LOCAL COLOR. VERY WELL, MISS WINTERS. REMEMBER, LADY MALVERTON, 8:00. I WOULDN'T MISS IT FOR THE WORLD. DEWEY, MY FRIEND, WE SHALL MAKE ONE LAST ATTACK ON THE ENEMY. COME ALONG. AND SOMETHING TELLS ME THAT WE'LL BE ABLE TO CONVINCE MY AUNT. WHERE DOES THAT AUNT STUFF COME IN? IN AMERICA, WE CALL PAWNBROKER'S UNCLES. I KNOW, BUT IN FRANCE, WE'LL ALWAYS STAY WITH THE LADIES. COME ALONG. OH, FRANCE. BONSOIR, MADAME BRIOCHE, MY FULL-BLOWN ROSE. AH, MONSIEUR RENE. MY HUSBAND IS OUT. THAT'S GOOD. I'D RATHER DO BUSINESS WITH YOU. OH, BUT YOU CAN'T. MY HUSBAND SAYS I ALWAYS LEND YOU TOO MUCH. YOU GET AROUND ME. OH, MRS. BRIOCHE. HOW WOULD ANYONE GET AROUND YOU? HE DOES. HE CHALLENGED ME SO MUCH, THEN I-- BELIEVE ME, I'M SINCERE. YOU KNOW THAT EACH NIGHT, WHEN I GO TO BED, YOU'RE THE LAST ONE I THINK OF? YEAH. YOU GOT HIS PAJAMAS. YOU SEE, EVERYTHING I HAVE IS YOURS. EVERYTHING BUT THE SUIT HE'S WEARING. AND NOW EVEN THIS I'M ABOUT TO LAY AT YOUR FEET. YOUR LAST SUIT. OH, BUT YOU CAN'T. EVEN IN PARIS, YOU MUST WEAR SOMETHING. AH, MY PRETTY PIGEON. YOU'RE SO SYMPATHETIC. I KNEW YOU'D UNDERSTAND. ISN'T SHE A DARLING? SHE'S AS SWEET AS SUGAR. SOME LUMP. NOW, I MUST WEAR MY EVENING CLOTHES, JUST FOR TONIGHT, AND I'M GOING TO LEAVE YOU THIS SUIT IN EXCHANGE, MY DEAR. OH, BUT I CAN'T. MY HUSBAND, HE WOULD KILL ME. BUT YOU MUST HAVE A HEART. THINK OF MY POOR SUIT, HANGING IN THAT DARK CLOSET ALL THESE DAYS. EVEN A SUIT MUST HAVE A LITTLE FUN. OH, MONSIEUR RENE, PLEASE. IF YOU COULD ONLY LEAVE SOMETHING MORE, JUST TO KEEP MY HUSBAND QUIET. WELL, I CAN LEAVE YOU MY FRIEND. HE'LL KEEP YOUR HUSBAND QUIET. OH, NO, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HOCK ME. DEWEY, MY AMERICAN FRIEND. NOTHING DOING. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HANG ME UP IN A DARK CLOSET ALL NIGHT. BUT I TELL YOU WHAT I WILL DO. HOW'S IT LOOK? OK, ONLY I'D ADVISE YOU TO STAY OUT IN THE AIR. YOU SMELL FROM CAMPHOR. THOSE CAMPHOR BALLS, YOU COULD BUMP OFF EVERY MOTH IN PARIS. THERE'S SO MANY THINGS I'D RATHER DO THAN GO TO LADY MALVERTON'S PARTY TONIGHT. AT LEAST YOU KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO EAT. FOR MY DOUGH, I'D RATHER TAKE A GOOD SLAP IN THE MOUTH. HEY! WHAT'S THE IDEA? YOU KNOW YOU CAN KILL A GUY? WITH THOSE EYES OF YOURS? PARLEZ-VOUS FRANCAIS? YOU KNOW, DEWEY, MY FRIEND, I-- OH, THERE MUST BE SOME MISTAKE. I'M NOT A MEMBER OF THE WEDDING PARTY. ISN'T THAT FUNNY? NEITHER AM I. BUT I'M SIMPLY CRAZY ABOUT WEDDINGS. WELL, YOU'RE CERTAINLY CRAZY ABOUT SOMETHING. TAXI. TAXI. MAY I DROP YOU SOMEWHERE? YES, YOU CAN DROP ME RIGHT HERE. IT'LL BE SO NICE NOT KNOWING YOU. OFFICER, I THINK THIS YOUNG MAN IS LOST. WILL YOU MIND HIM TILL SOMEBODY CLAIMS HIM? WHAT DOES HE MEAN? HE DOESN'T TALK ENGLISH, BUT I'LL BE GLAD TO TRANSLATE. OH, THAT'S FINE. TELL HIM YOU'RE BEGINNING TO GET ON MY NERVES. HE WOULDN'T BELIEVE THAT. YOU HATE YOURSELF, DON'T YOU? OH, NO. I LIKE MYSELF. WELL, YOU'RE CERTAINLY EASY TO PLEASE. MADEMOISELLE JOKES. TELL HIM TO GET RID OF YOU FOR ME. ALL RIGHT. TAXI! TAXI! TAXI! TAXI! TAXI! TAXI! WELL, AM I GOING YOUR WAY? NO. LET ME GO YOUR WAY, ALWAYS. THAT'S RIGHT. YOU MUST NEVER LEAVE ME. WE'LL JUST GROW OLD TOGETHER. YOU'LL NEVER GROW OLD. OH, YES, I WILL. I'VE AGED A GOOD DEAL IN THE PAST FEW MINUTES. BUT WHY? AS WE SAY IN AMERICA, WE HARDLY EVER PLAN OUR FUTURE WITH MEN WE DON'T KNOW. OH, BUT YOU AMERICANS HAVE NO IMAGINATION, NO FREEDOM, NO LIBERTY-- NO, NO. YOU HAVE THE LIBERTY. WE JUST HAVE THE STATUE. TONIGHT WILL BE SO WONDERFUL. I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU PARIS, AND PARIS YOU. OH, YOU'RE A GUIDE. THANKS, BUT I'VE SEEN PARIS. NOT MY PARIS. WHAT DO YOU VISITORS EVER SEE OF IT? I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU A CITY OF THE GREAT PAINTERS, MUSICIANS, AND POETS.

NO, BUT MY CLOTHES DO. WHAT DID HE SAY? HE SAID IT'S DINNERTIME. OH, DEAR, IT'S DARK! IS IT THAT LATE? YES. YOU SEE, DARLING, WE DIDN'T REALIZE. NOW YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE ME RIGHT BACK TO MY HOTEL. I'M DINING OUT. OH, NO. WE MUST DINE TOGETHER. I HAD A DATE, TOO, BUT, UH, I MADE IT BEFORE I MET YOU. AH, IT SEEMS SO LONG AGO. REMEMBER AFTER THE WEDDING, HOW YOU KISSED ME AND CARRIED ME OVER THE THRESHOLD OF OUR LITTLE TAXI? OH, WE'VE BEEN SO HAPPY HERE. COZY, ISN'T IT? WONDERFUL HOW YOU CAN RUN A LITTLE HOME ON 10 MILES PER GALLON. MAKING FUN OF ME? NO, I'M NOT, HONESTLY. DO YOU KNOW WHAT I WAS THINKING? NEXT SPRING, IF YOU GET A RAISE, WE'LL HAVE IT ALL DONE OVER IN EARLY AMERICAN. MAYBE I'VE BEEN A LITTLE TOO FRESH. I HUMBLY APOLOGIZE. WHAT ARE YOU UP TO NOW? I KNOW WHEN I'VE BEEN DEFEATED. I'LL TAKE YOU HOME. BUT I DON'T THINK YOU'VE BEEN PUNISHED ENOUGH. TAKE ME TO DINNER. BUT IT'S ONLY BECAUSE I'M HUNGRY. BONSOIR, MONSIEUR RENE. WE ARE TWO. MAY WE HAVE A WALL TABLE?

SO WHEN THE WAITER BROUGHT THE STEAK, THE MAN LOOKED AT IT AND HE SAID, "WAITER, IS THAT STEAK FRESH?" AND THE WAITER SAID-- THE WAITER SAID, "IS THAT STEAK FRESH? WHY, ONLY 3 HOURS AGO, IT WAS CHASING A FARMER!" DO BE A DEAR, RENE. I'VE BEEN PANTING FOR SOME OF YOUR COOKING, SIMPLY PANTING. I'D HATE TO PUT A GUEST TO WORK. PLEASE, NEVER THINK OF ME AS A GUEST. DID YOU HEAR THIS ONE? YES, WE DID. THINK OVER WHAT I TOLD YOU. I BEG YOUR PARDON, BUT MISS WINTERS ASKED ME TO MAKE THE CREPES SUZETTE. EH? WHAT'S THAT? YOU MAKE THE CREPES SUZETTE? NEVER HEARD OF SUCH A THING. VERY WELL, SIR. PERHAPS YOU'D LIKE TO TAKE ON THE OTHER DUTIES AS WELL! ISN'T HE GRACEFUL? HE USES HIS HANDS JUST LIKE STOKOWSKI.

WELL, IF THEY DO, I'LL WRAP THEM AND SEND THEM AROUND TO YOU IN THE MORNING. YES, DARLING. OH, WELL, I MUST BE FLYING. OH, DROP IN AGAIN. I'M USUALLY GOING TO BED AT THIS HOUR. WELL, THANKS, DARLING. I'D LOVE TO. ISN'T THAT LOVELY? GOOD NIGHT, PAULA. DO GET SOME REST, DEAR. YOU LOOK SO TIRED. YES. YOU'RE NOT TO TELL MISS WINTERS I'M HERE. I WANT TO SURPRISE HER IN THE MORNING. I WON'T IF YOU THINK IT'S ALL RIGHT. IT'S ALL RIGHT, MYRTLE. OH, RENE. WHY, I THOUGHT PERHAPS I MIGHT FIND YOU HERE. IS THAT WHY YOU CAME BACK? OH, NO, NO, NO. NO, I REALLY WAITED BECAUSE I WANTED TO ASK YOU IF YOU'D STAY WITH US WHILE YOU ARE IN LONDON, BUT I SEE YOU ALREADY ACCEPTED AN INVITATION. OH, NOT AT ALL. I'M NOT HERE AS A GUEST. I'M TAKING BESSIE'S-- THE COOK'S--PLACE. WOULD YOU THINK IT DREADFULLY BAD TASTE IF I CALLED YOU A LIAR? I'M AFRAID SO. DREADFULLY BAD TASTE. THEN WHY ALL THE SECRECY? NOW, WHAT ARE YOU TWO TRYING TO CONCEAL? KAY RUSHING OFF TO BED, AND YOU BOBBING IN AND OUT? IS MADAME SURE SHE'S NOT LETTING HER IMAGINATION RUN AWAY WITH HER? NOT AT ALL, BUT I DON'T HAVE TO WAIT FOR MY HOUSE TO STOP BURNING BEFORE I SEND FOR THE FIRE ENGINES. IS THAT ALL, MADAME? WELL, YES, THANK YOU. GOOD NIGHT, MADAME. AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR ARDOR. THAT'S QUITE ALL RIGHT. YES? OH, KAY, DEAR. I JUST WANTED TO TELL YOU THAT I FOUND WHAT I CAME BACK FOR. PAULA, THAT'S PRICELESS.

SCOUNDREL, CAD, AND EVERYTHING APPALLING! MADAME IS CALLING. AND SO GOOD-BYE. HELLO. WHO? OH, IT'S PHILLIP. YOUR NOBLE STRONGMAN. SUCH A STRONG MAN AND SUCH A WRONG MAN. I AM HERE WITH MADAME. SHE IS SLEEPING. FINE! ARE YOU LAUGHING, SIR, OR ARE YOU WEEPING? SWINE! IT'S JUST PHILLIP. HE SEEMS PERTURBED NOW. NO, MY MADAME CAN'T BE DISTURBED NOW. I JUST COOK AND TRY TO BE OF HELP, SIR.

YES, KAY. HMM? NO, RENE, NO. LET ME STAY JUST SO I CAN BE NEAR YOU. I'LL COOK. I'LL BE YOUR BUTLER-- BUT I DON'T WANT YOU TO BE MY BUTLER. IF I HAVE A BUTLER, I WANT A REGULAR ONE, IN LIVERY AND BUTTONS AND A LOT OF GOLD BRAID LIKE AN ADMIRAL. ALL RIGHT. I'LL BE YOUR ADMIRAL. BUT I DON'T WANT YOU TO BE MY ADMIRAL.

THEY'VE GOT THE WHOLE HOUSE SURROUNDED. WE'LL HAVE TO MAKE A BREAK FOR IT. OH, NO, NO, YOU CAN'T GO YET. THEY'LL SEE YOU, THEY'LL MAKE YOU TALK. OH, NO. THEY WON'T MAKE ME TALK. COME ALONG, DEWEY. GET YOUR HAT. BUT THEY MUSTN'T SEE YOU. DON'T YOU SEE, THEY'LL SNAP YOUR PICTURE. THEY'LL PRINT TERRIBLE STORIES ABOUT MISS WINTERS. YEAH! BUT, AGNES, DON'T YOU SEE THAT I CAN'T BE HERE WHEN MISS WINTERS GETS BACK FROM THE STUDIO? ESPECIALLY AFTER WHAT SHE SAID TO ME THIS MORNING WHEN THOSE WOMEN LEFT. HELLO? YES, THIS IS HER RESIDENCE.

AGNES, CALL THE POLICE DEPARTMENT AND HAVE THEM GET THOSE MEN AWAY FROM THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE. MR. CHESTER'S COMING TONIGHT FOR DINNER, AND I... RENE. GOOD EVENING. GOOD EVENING. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? I THOUGHT I DISCHARGED YOU THIS MORNING. YES, I KNOW. I'VE BEEN TRYING TO GO, BUT THOSE MEN HAVE BEEN WAITING TO TAKE MY PICTURE. THEY WANT ME TO GIVE THEM A STORY ABOUT US. I WAS AFRAID TO LET HIM GO. MR. RENE VILADEL IS NOT HERE. WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?! WELL, AGNES SAID THAT I WASN'T TO LET ANYONE KNOW THAT I WAS HERE, YOU SEE. OH, RENE! HOW COULD YOU DO A THING LIKE THAT?! THE PHONE HAS BEEN RINGING ALL AFTERNOON. SOMEBODY CALLS EVERY 10 SECONDS. AND I SUPPOSE YOU ANSWERED IT EACH TIME? OH, YES, PROMPTLY. THAT'S GREAT! PROBABLY ALL OF LONDON WILL BE DROPPING IN AROUND DINNERTIME. WHAT MASK SHALL I WEAR, MADAM? HOW DARE YOU STAY HERE AFTER I TOLD YOU TO GET OUT? DID YOU WANT ME TO GO OUT AND TELL THOSE MEN THAT YOU LOVE ME? YOU'RE THE MOST MADDENING PERSON I'VE EVER KNOWN. OH, NO. I CAN'T. SOMEBODY WILL THINK I'M HERE. AS IF THIS MORNING WASN'T ENOUGH. YOU KNOW, EVERYBODY THAT CAME INTO THE DRESSING ROOM ACTED IS IF THEY EXPECTED TO SEE YOU JUMP OUT OF THE WARDROBE. DO YOU KNOW IT TOOK ME ALL DAY TO CONVINCE PHILIP THAT MY INTEREST IN YOU BEGINS AND ENDS IN THE KITCHEN?! DON'T ANSWER THAT! WHY DID I GO TO PARIS?! I'M GOING MAD! YOU ANSWER ALL THE PHONE CALLS.

MY REPUTATION'S IN SHREDS, MY HOUSE TURNED INTO A LUNATIC ASYLUM, AND YOU TELL ME TO BE-- GET OUT OF HERE, DARLING. GET OUT QUICKLY BEFORE I SHOOT YOU! HAVE I GOT TO GET A LEGAL INJUNCTION TO GET RID OF YOU? WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? WHAT I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR FOR DAYS. YOU. OH, RENE. DON'T ANSWER THAT. LET'S BE SANE ABOUT THIS THING. YOU CAN'T BE SANE ABOUT LOVE. I CAN. I'M A VERY SANE WOMAN. I FOUND THAT OUT. STUPID TO SAY THIS IS LOVE. I DON'T EVEN KNOW YOU. ALL I KNOW IS YOU'RE A CHARMING YOUNG MAN WHO MAKES A DEVINE SALAD. AND DON'T FORGET THE CREPE SUZETTES. YOU HAVE NICE EYES AND A BREEZY TONGUE, BUT THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY A BASIS FOR AN ENDURING LOVE! YOU TALK OF LOVE AS IF IT WERE SOMETHING WITH A CORNERSTONE AND STEEL GIRDERS. A LAUGH, A MOMENT OF GAIETY, A MOMENT OF EXALTATION, THEN THE WHOLE PROBLEM BECOMES QUITE SIMPLE. AND WE BECOME QUITE SIMPLE-MINDED. YES. SO, MAY I STAY, KAY? NOW THAT IT'S ALL SETTLED? BUT THERE'S NOTHING SETTLED, RENE. THERE'S STILL A QUESTION WHETHER THIS IS LOVE AT ALL. ALL RIGHT. WELL, I'LL STAY HERE UNTIL THAT QUESTION IS SETTLED. VERY WELL. DO YOU WANT TO BE MY SERVANT? YES, KAY. "YES, MISS WINTERS." YES, MISS WINTERS. THEN YOU CAN START TONIGHT. THERE'LL BE DINNER FOR TWO. TWO FOR DINNER. I WANT IT EXCEPTIONALLY NICE. EXCEPTIONALLY NICE. MR. CHESTER'S COMING. MR. CHESTER. YES, MISS WINTERS. OH, I BEG YOUR PARDON, MISS WINTERS, JUST ONE MORE QUESTION. WHEN IS MY DAY OFF? EVERY SUNDAY. NOW, DON'T FORGET, THAT'S A STANDING DATE. THERE'S NOTHING IN IT. THIS ARTICHOKE IS NO GOOD. DEWEY, MY FRIEND, I'M AFRAID YOU HAVEN'T HAD MUCH EXPERIENCE WITH ARTICHOKES. YEP. I GUESS I'M STRICTLY A SPINACH MAN. HEY, HOW DO YOU LIKE MY NEW RIG? PERFECT. IT'S BEAUTIFUL. I KNOW MR. CHESTER WILL BE IMPRESSED. RENE... IS THAT GUY IN YOUR WAY? WHO? PHIL. THE ALL-AMERICAN CHESTER PROTECTOR. OH, HE'S NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT, DEWEY. JUST A LITTLE DUST IN MY EYE. HE'LL BLOW AWAY SOON. WELL, WHY DOES SHE KEEP HIM HANGING AROUND? SO THAT I'LL SEE HIM. SHE'S PLAYING A LITTLE GAME WITH ME. I AM AFRAID SHE WANTS TO MAKE ME JEALOUS. LOOK... IF YOU'D LIKE ME TO SOCK HIM IN THE EYE TONIGHT, JUST TIP ME OFF. AH, DEWEY, MY FRIEND, YOU HAVE THE WRONG APPROACH. YOU MUST BE VERY NICE TO MR. CHESTER. YOU MUST MAKE HIM VERY HAPPY AT HIS SUPPER TONIGHT. WE MUST LET HIM SEE THAT WE ALL LOVE HIM VERY MUCH. YOU MIGHT AS WELL GET USED TO SERVING HIM. SHH. AGNES TOLD ME IN THE STRICTEST CONFIDENCE THAT THIS WAS GOING TO BE AN ENGAGEMENT DINNER. I CAN BELIEVE IT. WELL, YEAH! OH, WE'VE BEEN EXPECTING IT A LONG TIME. MARK MY WORDS, HE'LL GO OUT OF HERE TONIGHT AN ENGAGED MAN. MYRTLE, I WANT YOU TO BE THE FIRST ONE TO KNOW THAT MR. CHESTER WILL NOT GO OUT OF HERE TONIGHT AS AN ENGAGED MAN. OH, YEAH? OH, YEAH. NO, I'M NOT THE LOVE CHEF! HELLO, MR. CHESTER. HELLO, MYRTLE. WHERE'S MISS WINTERS? HELLO, PHIL, DARLING! KAY, WHAT IS THIS ANYWAY? A WHOLE CROWD OF MEN OUT THERE ASKING ME IF I'M THE LOVE CHEF-- HOW SWEET! A BUSY MAN LIKE YOU TO PICK ALL THESE FLOWERS FOR ME. BUT, KAY, WHO ARE ALL THOSE MEN OUT THERE? JUST PHOTOGRAPHERS! OH, DARLING, ORCHIDS. I LOVE THEM! RENE! RENE! I KNOW, BUT A WHOLE BUNCH OF MEN STOPPED ME AS I... MONSIEUR IS BUSY. ANYTHING I CAN DO? OH, YES, DO! YOU CAN TAKE THESE FLOWERS FOR ME. OH, NOT THOSE. THESE. HERE. CAREFUL. DON'T CRUSH THEM, DEWEY. MY HAY FEVER. I'M ALLERGIC TO POLLEN. OH, SORRY. AND, DEWEY, WE'LL HAVE HIGHBALLS BEFORE DINNER. THAT'S OK WITH ME. I'LL TELL THE CHEF. KAY, I DON'T WANT TO BE DIFFICULT, BUT I THOUGHT YOU TOLD ME YOU GOT RID OF THOSE TWO FELLOWS. RENE? I DID. I FIRED HIM RUDELY. THE STREET WAS BLACK WITH REPORTERS. LONG AS HE HAD TO STAY, I THOUGHT HE MIGHT AS WELL MAKE DINNER. AFTER ALL, HE IS A WONDERFUL CHEF. I KNOW, BUT IT'S VERY EMBARRASSING TO ME FOR YOU TO HAVE THOSE TWO-- SHERRY? I THOUGHT I ORDERED HIGHBALLS. I KNOW, MISS WINTERS. BUT MR. RENE SAID SHERRY WAS BETTER FOR THE MEAL HE PREPARED. IT'S STARTING. MYRTLE, ANSWER THAT. AND WHOEVER IT IS, TELL THEM I'M OUT. HELLO. OH, I'M SORRY, LADY MALVERTON, BUT MISS WINTERS IS OUT TO DINNER. YES, MA'AM. GOOD-BYE. MYRTLE, ANSWER ALL THE OTHER CALLS IN THE KITCHEN. WE DON'T WANT TO BE DISTURBED BY ANYBODY. YES, MISS WINTERS. THANK YOU. HERE'S TO THE LOVELIEST GIRL IN THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD. AND TO THE FIRST OF A MILLION QUIET EVENINGS WE'LL SPEND TOGETHER. WELL, HERE'S TO THIS ONE ANYWAY. DINNER IS SERVED. COME, PHILIP. MUST WE HAVE THOSE CANDLES, KAY? I CAN'T SEE YOU AT ALL. TAKE THEM AWAY, RENE. NO CENTERPIECE AT ALL, MADAM? NO CENTERPIECE AT ALL. NO CENTERPIECE AT ALL. EXCUSE ME, SIR. DARLING, THESE LAST TWO DAYS, THEY'VE BEEN-- YOU'VE BEEN SO-- WELL... I MEAN... THESE LAST TWO DAYS-- THESE LAST TWO-- DAYS? YOU SEEM TO HAVE QUITE A RETINUE OF SERVANTS. NO, THANKS. GO AHEAD, TAKE SOME. WE GOT PLENTY. AH! ALPHABET SOUP. YES. DARLING, I HOPE YOU'VE THOUGHT OVER WHAT WE DISCUSSED LAST NIGHT. WE SURELY SHOULD KNOW BY-- I MEAN, YOU SURELY SHOULD-- I MEAN... SHOULD... I'VE LOST THE THREAD OF MY THOUGHT. RENE, WAIT IN THE KITCHEN. IN THE KITCHEN, MADAM? IN THE KITCHEN. IN THE KITCHEN. I KNEW WE SHOULD HAVE DINED AT THE SAVOY. THEY'LL BE OUT OF THE WAY SOON. I FEEL AS IF I WERE DELIVERING A SPEECH AT WATERLOO STATION. OH, I THINK YOU'VE DONE VERY WELL UNDER GREAT DIFFICULTIES. BUT, DARLING, I DID SO WANT YOU TO MYSELF, AT LEAST FOR THIS--OH... ONE LITTLE EVENING. PARDON ME. A CIGARETTE BETWEEN COURSES, MR. CHESTER? IF YOU DON'T MIND. OH, BEG YOUR PARDON, SIR. OF COURSE NOT. IT'S MERELY THAT IT WILL DESTROY THE QUALITY OF THE FOOD. THE MEAL I HAD PREPARED IS ALL NUANCE. IT'S MORE DELICATE THAN A BUBBLE. I--I... SORRY. THIS WAS ONLY MEANT AS A SUGGESTION, SIR. IT'S JUST A HABIT. I GUESS ALL THESE CIGARETTES ARE... ARE YOU OPENING A BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE TONIGHT? YES, I'VE SAVED A BOTTLE OF CORDON ROUGE 1923 FOR A SPECIAL OCCASION LIKE THIS. GOOD! IT SOUNDS AS THOUGH WE HAD SOMETHING TO CELEBRATE! OH, KAY, DARLING, I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW YOU DON'T--OH. SOME ASSISTANT, HUH? DOES IT TAKE 3 PEOPLE TO SERVE A SIMPLE MEAL FOR TWO? I NEED ASSISTANTS, MADAM. SEE IF YOU CAN DO WITHOUT IT. WITHOUT IT? WITHOUT IT. YES, MADAM. SNAILS! SNAILS?! HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT SNAILS? WELL, TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH, I'VE ALWAYS HAD A SORT OF INFERIORITY COMPLEX ABOUT THEM--I KNOW I OUGHT TO LIKE THEM. WE COULD THROW THEM OUT THE WINDOW. AH, IS THIS THE CHAMPAGNE? NO, SIR, THIS IS A VERY FINE CHABLIS 1921. BUT, KAY, I THOUGHT YOU SAID WE WERE TO HAVE CHAMPAGNE! MOST AUTHORITIES AGREE, SIR, THAT CHAMPAGNE AND SNAILS DON'T GO WELL TOGETHER. OF COURSE! I DIDN'T NOTICE! YOUR SNAIL, SIR. IS THAT ALL, SIR? YES! THANK YOU, SIR. CONFOUNDED POMPOUS PEST! OH, RENE! MR. RENE IS BUSY WITH YOUR OMELET. ALL RIGHT, MYRTLE. WE WON'T HAVE THE SNAILS. YES, BUT MR. RENE-- WE WON'T HAVE THE SNAILS! KAY, I'VE GOT TO HAVE A CIGARETTE. WELL, TAKE ONE. ASSERT YOURSELF! HE'S SO DOG-GONE SUPERIOR. THIS IS VERY GOOD WINE. YES. I HAVEN'T FINISHED THAT WINE. PLEASE LEAVE IT. WE ARE HAVING CHATEAU LAFITE WITH THE OMELET, SIR. BRING ME A WHISKEY AND SODA WITH MY OMELET. A WHISKEY AND SODA WITH THE OMELET, SIR? VERY WELL, SIR. DARLING, I THINK CHATEAU LAFITE WILL BE BETTER. POSSIBLY, BUT I'M NOT GONNA LET HIM TELL ME WHAT TO DRINK. OH, KAY, DARLING, WHY DID TONIGHT HAVE TO TURN OUT LIKE THIS? I HAD IT ALL PLANNED SO DIFFERENTLY. THIS EVENING WHILE I WAS DRESSING, I THOUGHT OF A HUNDRED THINGS I WANTED TO SAY TO YOU, BUT SO FAR, I'VE-- WELL, WHY DO YOU LOOK SO GUILTY? I'M AS JUMPY AS A GOAT. HE STARTLED ME. I DIDN'T HEAR HIM COME IN. SILENCE IS ESSENTIAL IN A GOOD SERVANT, SIR. SILENCE IS ONE THING, AND STEALTH IS ANOTHER. I'M SORRY, MISS WINTERS. KAY, DARLING, I WAS THINKING, AFTER ALL THIS UNPLEASANT TALK, AND ALL THE NEWSPAPER REPORTERS AND EVERYTHING, MAYBE IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA FOR US TO GET OUT OF LONDON. AND WE COULD FLY TO PARIS TOMORROW AND YOU COULD SPEND A COUPLE OF DAYS TROUSSEAU SHOPPING, AND THEN YOU COULD CATCH THE BOAT AT LA HAVRE ON WEDNESDAY. AND THEN WE COU-- RENE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? I WAS JUST WARNING MR. CHESTER THAT I WAS COMING, MISS WINTERS. WELL, YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE SO ELABORATE ABOUT IT. WE'RE NOT DEAD. NO, MISS WINTERS. I ASKED FOR A WHISKEY AND SODA! OH, HO, HO. I BEG YOUR PARDON, SIR. I THOUGHT YOU WERE JOKING, YOU SEE-- I'M SORRY. YOU SEE, IF I MAY SAY SO, SIR, I THINK YOU DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND THAT WITH AN OMELET-- I UNDERSTAND PERFECTLY! I'VE EATEN EGGS BEFORE! YES, BUT NOT THE WAY I MAKE THEM. YOU SEE-- THAT'LL BE ENOUGH, RENE! YES, MISS WINTERS. THIS OMELET HAS BEEN VERY CAREFULLY SEASONED, SIR, AND I THINK YOU'LL FIND IT SATISFACTORY WITHOUT ANY MORE SALT. I HAPPEN TO LIKE SALT! HE LIKES SALT! NO. NO! OF COURSE, IF YOU REALLY WANT A WHISKEY AND SODA-- RENE! YES, MISS WINTERS! EXCUSE ME FOR LAUGHING, DARLING, BUT YOU LOOK SO FUNNY. I GUESS I DO. I GUESS I'VE BEEN FUNNY ALL EVENING. I GUESS I GAVE YOU BOTH A GOOD LAUGH. OH, PLEASE, PHILIP! NOW, DON'T ACT LIKE THAT. YOU'LL SPOIL OUR WHOLE EVENING. I'LL SPOIL OUR EVENING?!

YES, OUT. OUT. BUT-- YES. OH, I... I MUST APOLOGIZE. HE'S NOT A VERY GOOD SERVANT. NO, I GUESS HE ISN'T. I GUESS HE'S A MUCH BETTER SWEETHEART! SO, YOU THINK THAT, TOO? WELL, WHY SHOULDN'T I? ISN'T THAT WHAT ALL OF LONDON THINKS? ALREADY YOU AND YOUR COOK HAVE REPLACED CRICKET AS THE NATIONAL AMUSEMENT OF ENGLAND! WELL, IF YOU'VE HAD YOUR EVENING'S AMUSEMENT, WILL YOU PLEASE GET OUT OF HERE?! GO? YES. I WANT YOU TO TAKE YOUR UNSULLIED SPLENDOR OUT OF MY HOUSE. CERTAINLY. YOUR HAT AND COAT, SIR. RENE!

I SUPPOSE YOU'VE HEARD WE'RE REPLACED CRICKET AS THE NATIONAL AMUSEMENT OF ENGLAND. YES, MADAM. STOP CALLING ME MADAM! YES, DARLING. OH, I'M SICK OF YOUR CLOWNING. YOU'VE HAD LOTS OF FUN, LOTS OF LAUGHS, YOU AND THE REST OF LONDON. YES, THERE HAVE BEEN MOMENTS. MOMENTS? AND I THINK THERE HAVE BEEN MOMENTS FOR YOU, TOO. I CERTAINLY HAD A BIG MOMENT TONIGHT. WITH PHILIP AGAINST ME, EVERYBODY IN LONDON WILL THINK I'M IN LOVE WITH MY COOK. WELL, THAT'S TRUE, ISN'T IT? WE LOVE EACH OTHER. A MYSTERIOUS FORCE HAS BEEN DRAWING US TOGETHER. I DON'T FEEL ANY MYSTERIOUS FORCE DRAWING ME TO YOU, UNLESS IT'S AN IMPULSE TO BRAIN YOU. NOW, KAY, DARLING, YOU KNOW THAT'S NOT TRUE. WHY'VE YOU GOT ME IN YOUR HOUSE? BECAUSE I COULDN'T GET RID OF YOU. BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T WANT TO GET RID OF ME. OH, SHUT UP. DON'T PRETEND TO BE FURIOUS. YOUR HEART IS BEATING JUST AS FAST AS MINE IS. THIS IS THE MOMENT YOU'VE BEEN WAITING FOR. AND EVEN NOW, YOU HAVEN'T GOT THE COURAGE TO TAKE IT. KAY, YOU LOVE ME. I DON'T LOVE YOU. I DON'T LOVE YOU. I DON'T LOVE YOU AT ALL. I DON'T EVEN LOVE YOU THAT MUCH. THAT'S WHAT I MEAN. YOU LOVE ME. AND, KAY... KAY... KAY, I LOVE YOU, DARLING. LET ME GO OR I'LL SCREAM. NO, DON'T SCREAM! REMEMBER LONDON. OH, I'M SORRY.

YOU'D BEST SERVE ME BY UNLOCKING THE DOOR AND GETTING OUT. IN A MOMENT. I WANT TO TALK TO YOU FIRST. WE HAVE NOTHING TO TALK ABOUT! I DON'T WANT TO TALK TO YOU! I HAVE NOTHING TO SAY TO YOU. TOMORROW YOU WILL SAIL FROM ENGLAND AND WE MAY NEVER SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN, KAY. OH, THAT'S WONDERFUL. THEN PERHAPS I CAN LEAD A NORMAL LIFE AGAIN. IT ISN'T NORMAL TO BE WITHOUT LOVE. WELL, IT CERTAINLY ISN'T NORMAL TO BE IN LOVE WITH YOU. GIVE ME THAT KEY. IF YOU GO OUT THAT DOOR, I WON'T MARRY YOU. MARRY YOU?! WHY, I-- NOW, TAKE YOUR TIME, DARLING. I'LL WAIT. GIVE ME THAT KEY! YOU'RE FURIOUS NOW BECAUSE YOUR VANITY IS WOUNDED. BUT IN A LITTLE WHILE, YOU'LL GET OVER THAT AND YOU'LL MARRY ME. MARRY YOU? I WANT YOU TO GET OUT OF THIS BEDROOM IMMEDIATELY! IF PHILIP WAS HERE, HE'D TAKE YOU BY THE BACK OF THE NECK AND TOSS YOU RIGHT OUT ON THE STREET. YES?! KAY, DARLING? IT'S ME, PHILIP. I'VE COME BACK. YOU'VE MADE ME SO HAPPY! KAY, PHILIP IS HERE. I'VE GONE TO BED, PHILIP! BED?! I CAME OVER TO SIT FOR SOME PICTURES. THE "DAILY PRESS" CALLED ME UP. THEY SAID YOU'D ANNOUNCED OUR ENGAGEMENT. OH, KAY, I'M SO HAPPY! BUT THE REPORTERS HAVE LEFT! WE'LL TAKE THE PICTURES IN THE MORNING. I'VE GONE TO BED OFFICIALLY, PHILIP. GOOD NIGHT... DEAREST. NO, I'M NOT GOING HOME NOW. I CAN'T GO HOME. I'M TOO HAPPY! SLIP ON SOMETHING AND COME ON OUT. WE'LL HAVE A DRINK TO OUR ENGAGEMENT. TAKE YOUR TIME, DARLING. I'LL WAIT IN THE LIVING ROOM. OH, KAY, I'M SO HAPPY! YOU WANTED PHILIP. GO TO HIM. BUT I DON'T WANT PHILIP. I NEVER WANTED HIM. DARLING, DARLING, HOW LONG IT'S TAKEN. TWO DAYS. TOO LONG. WELL, MY LIFE WAS SO NICE AND PEACEFUL UNTIL YOU CAME ALONG. NOW WE CAN GET MARRIED AND NEVER BE PEACEFUL AGAIN, DARLING. OH, NO, DEAR. IT'S OUT OF THE QUESTION. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? OH, YOU HAVEN'T A PENNY TO YOUR NAME. YOU COULDN'T EVEN SUPPORT ME. THAT'S ALL RIGHT. YOU CAN SUPPORT YOURSELF. OH, RENE, THAT SOUNDS DREADFUL. YOU COULDN'T MARRY A WOMAN THAT MAKES MORE IN A WEEK THAN YOU DO IN TWO YEARS. WHY NOT? I'LL GUARANTEE TO SUPPORT MYSELF. YOU CAN DO THE SAME. AND WHO WILL YOU COOK FOR NEXT? I'LL HAVE MY OWN RESTAURANT. IT'LL BE A BIG THING WITH CAFE RENE ON IT. DARLING, IT'S SO IMPOSSIBLE. IF THEY SAY THAT GOOD-LOOKING RESTAURANT KEEPER-- KAY WINTERS HUSBAND-- USED TO BE HER COOK, SHE BOUGHT THE RESTAURANT FOR HIM. YOU WOULDN'T LIKE THAT. YOU COULDN'T STAND IT. YOU DON'T WANT TO MARRY ME. OH, DARLING, IF YOU ONLY KNEW HOW MUCH. RENE, I'M NOT A SNOB, BUT LOOK AT US. I'M A MOVIE STAR-- AND I'M ONLY A POOR FRENCH MARQUIS. A MARQUIS? ARE YOU A MARQUIS? YES. YOU SEE, YOU ARE A SNOB. WELL, NOT AT ALL. YOUR TITLE DOESN'T INTEREST ME A BIT. BUT, DARLING, WHY DON'T YOU USE IT? IT'S SO UNIMPORTANT, EXCEPT TO AMERICANS. IT WOULD SOUND RATHER WELL, WOULDN'T THAT? MADAME DE MARQUIS. YOU'D HAVE A LITTLE CREST ON YOUR NOTEPAPER, YOUR CAR, YOUR PILLOWSLIP, YOU COULD TELL YOUR PUBLIC THAT MY FATHER WAS A MARQUIS, AND MY GRANDFATHER, AND HIS FATHER BEFORE HIM. KAY, WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE A DUKE AT YOUR TABLE? WOULDN'T YOU LIKE TO HAVE A ROYAL PRINCE AS YOUR WEEKEND GUEST? COOK OR NO COOK, I'D BE QUITE A CATCH FOR YOU, WOULDN'T I? YOU SAY YOU'RE ONLY AN ACTRESS. AND I'M A MARQUIS. WAIT, WAIT! WHERE ARE YOU GOING?! ANYWHERE. WHAT DO YOU CARE? RENE! YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO ME! YOU KNOW AS WELL AS I DO I DON'T CARE ANYTHING ABOUT YOUR TITLE. WHAT'S GOING ON HERE, KAY?! HELLO, PHILIP! RENE, YOU KNOW AS WELL AS I DO THAT PEOPLE DON'T GO AROUND MARRYING THEIR COOKS, I MEAN, WITHOUT A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF HESITATION. I WANT YOU TO EXPLAIN TO ME-- SHUT UP, PHILIP! RENE, PLEASE STAND STILL AND LISTEN TO ME. I'M PERFECTLY WILLING TO ADMIT I WAS CRAZY ABOUT YOU FROM THE FIRST MOMENT-- KAY, YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO DO SUCH A THING TO ME! RENE, DON'T LEAVE ME! IF YOU LEAVE LIKE THIS, I MAY NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN. RENE, DON'T LEAVE ME! OH, SHUT UP, PHILIP! IT SEEMS TO ME I HAVE A PERFECT RIGHT TO CALL THE WHOLE THING OFF, KAY. OH, SHUT UP, PHILIP! OH, RENE, WAIT! I'LL GIVE YOU ONE MORE CHANCE! COME BACK BEFORE I COUNT 3! ONE, TWO! OH, KAY, I'M SO UNHAPPY! RENE, WAIT! STOP FOLLOWING ME! NO, YOU FOLLOWED ME ALL THE WAY FROM PARIS. I WON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE AGAIN. OH, RENE, I CAN'T SEE IN THIS FOG. SOMEDAY YOUR EYES WILL OPEN. OH, RENE, COME HOME. YOU'LL CATCH COLD! I DON'T CARE. WELL, I'LL CATCH COLD! STOP FOLLOWING ME. I WILL NOT! THE STREET'S FREE! PLEASE WAIT! RENE! RENE, DARLING. WAIT! STOP! YOU'LL CATCH COLD! I DON'T CARE. WELL, I'LL CATCH COLD. ALL RIGHT, GET IN THERE. WHERE ARE WE GOING? I DON'T KNOW. I'M GETTING SCARED. WHERE ARE WE? I DON'T KNOW! DARLING, DARLING. PLEASE--PLEASE, DON'T BE SO STUBBORN. WE CAN FLY OVER TO PARIS IN THE MORNING. NO ONE IN LONDON WILL EVER KNOW. OH, HONEY. DARLING, PLEASE PUT YOUR ARMS AROUND ME. I'M--I'M FRIGHTENED. WHERE ARE WE? MUST BE AN OLD WAREHOUSE. WELL, LET'S GET OUT OF HERE. OH, DARLING, KISS ME FIRST. NO ONE WILL EVER KNOW. IT'S THE OPERA HOUSE! NO ONE IN LONDON WILL EVER KNOW. IS THAT ALL, MADAME? NO! CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY TURNER ENTERTAINMENT GROUP
