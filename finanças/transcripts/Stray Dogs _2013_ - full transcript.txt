Milano Park "In anger my hair stands on end "and as the rain stops "I launch a shrill cry at the heavens "My valiant heart loses hope "My exploits are naught but mud and dust "And my wanderings, but a cloud under the moon "Regret may turn my still-young head grey "O vainglorious pain! "The shame of defeat is not yet washed away "When will the grief of the Empire's subjects end? "May the soldiers wallow in the flesh of the barbarians "May they quench their thirst on the blood of the Xiongnu "When our peaks and rivers are conquered once more "The Emperor will receive our homage."

But because they're weak they're always being mistreated. They ask the Fairy to send them a king, so that no one will ever mistreat them again. At midnight they pray to have a king. But all they get sent is a simple stick of wood. The frogs pray again for a king. This time they get sent a crane, which eats them all up. No one protects the frogs. Poor things. That's a scary story. Are the cracks in the walls because of ghosts? - The wall is sick. - How do you mean? A house is like a person. It gets sick, it grows old.

Why is the house in such a bad state? What happened? - That's a secret. - Tell me. One day it started raining... It rained non-stop. It rained so hard that water got in. The house started crying... and crying... Can't you see the tears? You see? Up there. - The white bits? - Yes, the tracks of its tears. I can't see any water. It dried up. Shall I help you?
