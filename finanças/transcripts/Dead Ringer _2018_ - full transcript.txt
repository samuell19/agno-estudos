Hey, that little shit Donny came to my house, sat down with my family, and took five million dollars of my money. He promised me I'd have a shipment of Venom on the next day. And because I believed in you, because I trusted you, Ray, I believed in him. And all I got was a fucking signed D5 picture for my daughter. That's it. And that was six months ago, six months ago, Ray. I think you can say I've been more than patient. Don't worry. Donny's being dealt with. There's a second shipment on its way to you and you will be compensated. Hey, hey, hey. What about the other guy, huh? The other guy. My sources over there in London, they're telling me you and him are still, you know, friendly. Is that true? I really believe he had nothing to do with this. Besides he's an idiot. And well, if he is involved, he'll pay, too. Pay? I want him to suffer. I want my money back and I want my shipment of Venom. I'd love to stay here and chat all day with you but I gotta go.

Okay, man, you good to go. - You know where to go. - Yes, Sir. Hopefully, we do it again next week. Alright, man. This is main gate to base.

Come on, come on, you're late. Got pick up. Tiny. How the devil are you? - Just pick up the gear, Lou. - Chatty as ever, I see. You know, not a lot of people know this but, uh, when you've created a hip recreational drug like Venom, you still gotta go through all these pesky little human trials, you know. I'm trying to find out what works, what doesn't, if there are any good reactions or bad. Designing it, refining it, till you get something you know can sell. So, um, your customers, they like Venom then? Let me tell you, you take it once, you're hooked on it for life. The euphoric buzz you get from it, it's like you just touched the Gods. One of our earlier batches had the side effect of, uh, paralysis. The other rendered people mute. Good thing about this though is we found out what caused these problems and lift them out of Venom, but on the flip side, we could refine them for more useful applications. I see the police decoy worked then. Boss man knows what he's doing. Don't he? Yeah. Is he about? I wanted to thank him for the lovely little gift. He's upstairs taking care of business. I'll catch you next time, yeah. The drug we have you on, we call it R2. This is keeping you in this paralyzed state. Mix it with D2, you can't even speak but you can still feel everything. I can't imagine what's going through your mind right now. I mean, heh, you're probably screaming. That's gotta hurt. Now, for a little bit of good news, Donny. Now, apparently, some of these other drugs can alleviate some of your symptoms, so, if the good doctor here gives you... Ah... ...this one, you will finally regain the power of speech. Basically, Donny, in this conversation, I'm in control. I hold all the cards. So, just tell me the truth and everything will be okay. I'll give it about thirty seconds, he'll be able to talk. I just need to know where my money is and whilst you had it, why you thought it was a good idea not to deliver the goods to Boyd or me. Did you actually think you could avoid seeing me to pay me back? Wow. This one is keen to talk, Sir. Donny, remember, not only I want to hear the truth, and please, please, please, no profanity. Now, you were saying? - You have... - I have what? The money? No, I don't think so. No. You have the wrong guy.

It ain't gonna happen, mate, because of your face. And what do you mean by that? Look, mate, what record company's gonna sign another Donny Martin? Cool, maybe you're right. But I'm still going out on that stage tonight because a band don't let their fans down. D5 wouldn't do it and neither will I. Alright, boys, looking good. You ready then? Yeah. Ready as ever. D5! D5!

You never delivered the batch of Venom to Boyd and, yet, you took his money, my money. You got a massive pair on you, I'll give you that. Here you lie incapacitated, I could do whatever the fuck I want to you and, yet, you... You... You feed me this horseshit. Look, even I know, Donny Martin has had this tattoo for years. They gave me a makeover to make sure nobody could tell the difference, including the fucking toe. And now we have already heard you sing your latest release, but here at Afternoon Chat, we thought we'd surprise you with a little rendition of "On Fire." Here are five guys from Essex and they're called Dive. ♪ Love it when you walk around With no panties on ♪ ♪ In my shirt From the night before ♪ - ♪ Girl you catch my eye ♪ - Dive? - That's a proper dive, mate. - Dive. - What?

Give me the fucking microphone. What is this shit? Get off. Please see from our point of view, these Essex lads are creating a real noise in the local press. Mainly due to that lead singer. That's what I don't understand. You really can't see the likeness? - What are you talking about, mate? - The only reason why these guys are in a tribute band is because of their lead singer. Look. Oh, my God. Why I haven't seen that before? Yeah, so, uh, basically, they don't like our version of the tune. I'm not surprised, are you? Mel, come on. I know you and everyone else seems anti Dive right now, but one thing you can't say is that we sound bad. You're not even joking, are you? I actually brought you here tonight to tell you something. Really? I'm... Um, remember I said how well work was going? They have given me another promotion. Babe, that's amazing. Wow, well done. I am so proud of you. Thank you. It does mean a lot to me that what I achieve - actually makes you happy, you know. - Of course. Whatever makes you happy makes me happy. But I haven't told you the best bit yet. So basically, this has all come about because my company's bought another firm and they want me to run that office in their image. Amazing. Go on. Yeah, not only that, I get to build my own team and hire who I like. You know where I'm going with this, don't you? Oh, really? Like, it could be amazing. Imagine me and you working together every day. And, look, once you've learned the business, maybe we could even set up on our own. Whoa, slow down, Mel. You just told me you've been thinking about it for a while, yet, I've only just found out about it and we're already in business together. No, I'm not saying that, I'm just telling you all the possibilities. This job that I've got in mind for you I think you'll be really, really good at. Don't patronize me. Please, just think about it. New town, new job, could be great for both of us. Yeah, I just don't get... - Did you say new town? - Yeah, that's the other thing. The job's in Glasgow. Glasgow. You're gonna commute from London to Glasgow every day? No, that'd be stupid. They're fully relocating me, or us. All expenses covered. And when is this supposed to be? Two weeks from Monday. Are you finished here? - Yes. - Yeah. Can I get you the sweet menu? - I am alright, love. - Not for me, thanks. - Where are you going? - Home. If you've known about this for a while, well, you're being unreasonable. Either way, I don't want to be here right now. Good luck in Glasgow. - Hello. - Jamie. It's Gary. Look, mate, I'm sorry to call you so late but I'm leaving the band. What? Why? Oh, for God's sakes, man, Gary, just tell him. It's alright, Gary. I get it. It's Amanda. - She doesn't want you in the band anymore. - No. Sorry, mate. Cool, good luck. - I love you, baby. - I love you. Not even in the fucking door yet. - Hello. - Hello, Jamie. I'm so glad I got you. Hi, Paul. You spoke to Gary? The same, mate. Have you seen the news? No. Why? Just turn it on, you'll see. What appears to have happened according to eyewitnesses is that a Range Rover was driving at considerable speed down this country lane. The driver overtook a truck, lost control of the vehicle, and rolled over several times before crashing. We can now identify the driver as Donny Martin, the lead singer of the band D5. He has just been taken away in an ambulance in critical condition but miraculously... Sophie. Thank God, you are here. Well, where is he? I'm so sorry. I know you and Donny were close, but Donny didn't make it. He had a, um, cardiac arrest on the way to the hospital - and he was pronounced dead on arrival. - Oh, my God. I'm so sorry, Jay. Sophie, who else knows about this? Um, the ambulance crew, a few of the hospital staff. I tried to keep it under wraps as best as I could because that's what you might want to do an official press release. Donny Martin can't be dead, he just can't. I get that, Jay, but he is. Perhaps... And this is gonna sound a bit crazy, perhaps he doesn't need to be. What? No, no, no. Jay, I know that look and I think I know what you're gonna say, so please, don't even suggest it. Just think about it, okay? Look at the facts. On the one hand, I have a dead lead singer of the most popular boy band, a boy band that I sunk millions into, and on the other, just this morning, we had a look-alike who not only looks like Donny but has been trying to sing like him for the past five years. Don't you think that was fate or something? Look, let's say that you do this. What are you gonna do about the hospital staff? It's easy, just pay them off. Okay, so you pay them off, what if they blab anyway? - Then we break their legs. - Jay. Just kidding. Okay, Jay, I'll help but if this ever gets out, I had nothing to do with it. Fine. Come on. Now we've got Paul McCartney to get ready for. - A Paul McCartney what? - Google it, Sophie. 1966 Beatles conspiracy. Jamie, I'm Sophie. Follow me. Jay, meet Jamie. Uh, Jamie, my boy, come in. You wore glasses and a hoodie like I asked? Thank you. So, did anybody see you or did you tell anyone you're coming here today? And please be honest. No. You phoned me, told me to keep it quiet and wear this get up, so I did. I left me house, three blocks down, I met your driver, and here I am. Excellent, thank you. Just need to ask you one question, Sir. Okay. Why? Why go through all this trouble to make sure nobody knows I'm here? Because, dear boy, you're a gift from God and I need your help. I can give you everything you've always wanted, successful singing career, could even get rid of that scar, but it comes at a price. When I tell you the price, you'll understand why all the awkward questions. He wanted me to become Donny Martin, to take on his life. Think about it. He was a guy at the pinnacle, in probably the most exciting part of his life and I could have it all; the money, the accolades, the girls, the lifestyle, the opportunity to have a full singing career without even trying. But I had to leave my old life behind. Instead of Donny Martin dying that night, it would have been Jamie Poulton. I was given strict instructions to leave everything behind. But I took a memento to remind me of where I've come from. Okay. Let's do this crazy thing. Deliver the news to Gary Reilly, the people are gonna start talking, if Donny's look-alike dies in a car crash the day after Donny. Well, you have given this some thought, haven't you? How did this happen? Well, we found his body floating in the canal. We believe he was drunk, slipped in, hit his head and drowned. All he had on him was his phone with your name and details on it. What about his foster parents? I've never met them both. Don't worry, we ran his name through a computer and his foster history came up. We've already spoken to them and one couple have identified the body and arranged a funeral. - Any problems? - None. It all went sweet as a nut. Its flame consumes me. We entrust Jamie to you, our God, and bring he to life eternal. I'm really sorry, Mel. If there's anything that me and Gary can do, just ask. We are here for you. Jamie, Jamie, Jamie. Listen, Jay's bringing in the press but you don't say anything, okay? But you are Donny from now on, okay? Donny has had a nasty accident as you can see, but he'll make a full recovery and will be back to work in just a couple of weeks after he's fully recovered. I'm gonna make you into the man you should be, and teach you how to sing, to show you how to groove, so we enter the world from Jamie Poulton to Donny fucking Martin. I've got to get this right. I will be the best Donny Martin, even better. Well, here he is, guys. He gave us quite a scare there for a minute but Donny's back to peak fitness. Oh, my God. You alright, bro? - It's really good to see you, mate. - He's back. Let me get this right, you expect me to believe you are this guy named Jamie who gave up his own life and lied to all his friends and family and told them he was dead just to pursue some dream of singing on a stage? Exactly, my life was going nowhere fast. No, no, I don't believe that. See, I believe anybody could have strong aspirations to want to become a pop star and to want all the trappings of being a pop star without the hard work, but to lie that deeply to your friends and loved ones, to give up your own existence with no option of return. You knew nothing about the personal life of Donny Martin. Who could be that stupid? Me. If you would have lived the life of Jamie Poulton, go through the same shit I did, you would have done exactly the same. Shall I sedate him again, Sir? Give him a chance to rethink his story? If I give him this drug, it can wipe his short-term memory, see if we're getting the same story. Nah, I want to see where this is going besides this, uh... This is getting interesting, don't you agree? Sir, it's Boyd, he's on the phone again. Fuck, I ain't got time to talk to him now but tell him I'll call him back. Okay, okay, so there were only a few people in Jamie's life so you could easily walk away from that but what about Donny Martin? I find it hard to believe that one man could slip into another man's shoes, especially somebody so public and popular as Donny Martin. Well, that's where Jay's little master-plan come into effect. Fitness-wise, Donny's absolutely fine. In fact, doctor says he's probably the fittest he's ever been. Wait, wait, wait, man. I knew it. I knew there was something different about you. You lost them extra pounds you put on, innit? Seriously, guys, although Donny's good to come back to work, the accident has left some unseen scars, you know. Doctors said he's got some neurological problems now. Neurological problems, like what? Basically, I get night terrors and, uh, my memory ain't very good. The doctors called it Swiss cheese brain. No, what about your voice? Oh, uh, yeah, another weird side effect. At least I didn't wake up speaking in Japanese. Listen, I'm all normal, long-term, short-term memory, few always here and there but over time and with your help, we can rebuild them memories, yeah. - Of course. - Of course, mate. It's exactly what we are gonna do. We're gonna continue as normal, and when Donny can't remember something, we'll fill in the holes. Continue as normal. So, boys, are you with me? Well, I'm in. - I'm in. - Yes. What do you mean? Come on. Mate, you just had a bad accident. Danny, are you in? I thought you was gonna retire. I mean, we said if you retire, we'd understand. Are you kidding, Dan? Yeah, yeah, this is a new beginning now. I ain't come all this way to give up. Are you in? Well, let's go. Yeah. To the new reborn D5.

Fuck me, Donny. Eight weeks and you're still thinking like Jamie. Jay, I think I'm dealing with this pretty well actually. Yes, we are, the boys, the world. No one has even questioned your identity. Well, look, if that's what you think then cool. Fuck, Jamie, give me your room key. What? - Why? - Come on, stop it, bollocks. Give me your room key. Hey, come here, babe. What? Hello, boys. Well, ain't you a pretty little thing? Do you recognize my young friend over here? Of course, it's Donny Martin from the band D5. Congratulations, you get to spend the night with Donny Martin. - Ah... - Go upstairs, and await his arrival. Okay, see you in a minute. Jay, what the fuck? I just basically pushed you with a random, sweet, maybe not so innocent girl because she thought you were Donny Martin. If she didn't think that, this would not be happening right now. Okay, alright. What about the guys? Well, the fact they're even here, touring, says it all, doesn't it? Listen, the boys all want solo careers and the only reason they haven't is because of their loyalty to you, Donny Martin. Okay, yeah. You are right. It's working. And that's exactly what my life had become... Yes. For the next six months, everything was perfect until yesterday. I told my mommy about some of the fan pics from the other day. If you look at the pictures of Donny before the accident to the ones after the accident, he looks different. Well, we can, uh, show you what Katie means. Better-looking version. Katie, I do see the differences, but, um, Donny was in a very nasty accident so that may account for those differences. No, not really. I have been to every home D5 concert and, at every one, Donny has made time to take pictures with me. But the last one, it was like he didn't even know me. Perhaps he was busy, didn't have enough time. And that's what I said but Katie's got another theory. He signed my T-shirt that night and it also have another autograph before the accident, too. The morning of Donny's car accident, you had D5 on your program. You also had a fake group called Dive. I think Donny was replaced by the boy who looked like Donny in Dive. So, what now then, Boss? What do you mean now? Well, don't we need to put a new story out explaining Donny's "Swiss cheese" head? The public need to know. Oh, no offense here, Donny. No. You have to be kidding, guys. This is brilliant. Jay, where are you going? I'm going to set up some recording studio time. We're gonna make a track that when you play it backwards, it says "Donny is dead." Hold up, Jay. I need a word, man. - Oi, Jay, stop. - What's up? What do you think? We just got rumbled by a 12-year-old girl. Keep your voice down. No, we haven't. As I said, you've entered the annals of pop-myth history. Elvis is still alive. John Lennon murdered by CIA and Stevie Wonder can see. See, that's the kind of publicity you can't buy, son. Look, Jay, I get what you're saying. You said you needed me to do this to earn back everything you've invested into the group so far, well, surely, by now, six months down the line, you've got it all back. You ungrateful little shit. After all I have done for you. Now that D5 are back together more popular, you want out? It doesn't work like that, son. Jamie is dead. Your life is mine, boy. Besides, where are you gonna go, Donny? I couldn't believe it. After everything we'd done. I thought we were in it together. It was clear now that I'd just been used. I went outside to call someone, anyone, to scream up, that I am Jamie, not Donny. And here we are. Exactly. And I still don't know why I'm here. Who you fucking are? I gotta hand it to you, Donny. You know, most people that are drugged like this, they freak out, they babble, they cry, but you... you... You flipped it, man. You remained totally calm from the moment I woke you up, stringing me along, setting me up with your stories and, uh, I almost believed you. But you still don't. No, no, I don't. Now, I'm a fair man. I don't want to punish the wrong guy. Luckily, for you, I have a way to confirm if you are lying to me or not. How? Nah. See, in situations like these, you do all the talking and when I get back, if I have confirmed that you are in fact Donny Martin, the Donny Martin that I know and love, do me a favor and please start panicking like a good fucking hostage. Doc, he is all yours. Yes, Sir. Gotta say I... love that story but I do hope you're Donny Martin. They promised me you. A nice young fit specimen like you. I can't wait. 43 minutes. 43 minutes since we last spoke. Ray, is it done? No, because it's gonna take time to sort this out. It's not as straightforward as I once thought. Sorry. Ray, I don't understand. Are you telling me that this little shit is, uh... He's still living? What are you doing over there, huh? What are you doing? Do I have to come over there and show you how to do a good job properly? Do I? If so, I'm not gonna be very happy. Is that a threat, Boyd? All I'm saying is that by now, I would have gotten this situation sorted and Donny fucking Martin would be dead by now. You know what, come to think of it, Ray, if I didn't know any better, I'd, uh... I'd think that maybe this was the way you had it planned all along, so, you can rip me off. This will be sorted and I'll let you know when it is. Damn it. Boyd has pushed me too far now. I need you to tell me everything you know. I told you, give me a little bit more time. I know I'll find the money. - More time. - Yeah, it's his memory loss. He's forgot where he stashed it. Six months, I gave you six fucking months. Where the fuck did that get me? Fuck. Ray! Oi, you stop! Oi, God! I've been meaning to ask you, why've you got two coins stacked together? 'Cause I like to keep the odds stacked in my favor. How did you find working with us? Uh, actually, apart from carrying the guns, it's pretty much the same as back home. Have you been to the U.K.? Me? No. I haven't even got a passport. This is for you. I mean, look around. Why would you ever wanna leave? It's true. It's beautiful, eh? I always thought you, uh, English cops would be more like that, um, Sherlock Holmes, you know, a bit stuck-up in dirt working out your cases with a spyglass looking for clues. I think you've been watching too many films. So, what now? No leads, go home, face music, start again. Why are you so determined to get these guys? Have you seen the effects of these drugs? It's vile. I've seen the results of prolonged use on kids as young as 18. I've got a little girl. I want this shit off the streets before she grows up. Whoa! That's quite a mission for one man, is it not? Yeah, that's what I keep hearing. You've got to try. Anyway, listen, I gotta get going. I'm going to miss my plane. Thanks for the drink and the chat. I really appreciate it. Remember, if it don't go well at home, remember what they say, Florida isn't so much a place where one goes to reinvent oneself, as it is a place where one goes if he no longer wishes to be found. I'll remember that. I hope it doesn't come to it. See you, buddy. Hey, Green, before you go, a souvenir. Yeah, it's me Ben. The English cop's gone, but don't worry, he knows nothing. The crate switch worked perfectly. He has no idea how you're getting your drugs into the country or who you are. Oh, for fuck sake. Everything all right, Barry? Alright, Dave, I just came out and the fucking tires are flat. You are joking? Something's done on the front one. What happened? I don't know. Around here, it's probably kids. Why don't you use one of these? Wait, watch it, mate. I can give you everything you've always wanted, successful singing career, could even get rid of that scar. Come on, a large amount of money has been taken and we don't know why. Donny has been our band member for the last 5 years. We gotta find him. So, to recap, if anybody knows the whereabouts of Donny Martin, please call the helpline we set up or the police. A large amount of money he's taken from his band members and we don't know why, but we want to help him. But to help him, we must first find him. Excuse me, love, that's not your drink. Oh, my God, is it Donny Martin? Guys, it's Donny Martin, he's wanted. - I am not Donny. - Oh, my God, that's a gun. - I'm Jamie. - Call the police. - Oi, come here. - Someone stop him. ♪ On a play ♪ ♪ In the play mode There's a voice in my way ♪ ♪ But now the veil is dropping To my feet ♪ ♪ Deliverer won't let me be ♪ Oi, you looking for a good time, love? ♪ Lift myself up Off the ground ♪ ♪ And I will do it ♪ ♪ Invoke the styles in me ♪ ♪ Time to turn my life around ♪ ♪ And I'm about to hit the sky ♪ ♪ To get away to my alter life ♪ ♪ Whatever happened now I'm so invisible ♪ ♪ I see myself in another life Alright, alright, must fall ♪ Old man.

What are you gonna do? - I said, leave him alone. Disengage, disengage. Firearm, firearm. See you next time, Benny. Thank you, son. It's my pleasure. I just don't like bullies. I know what you mean. I'm afraid that sort of thing's a regular occurrence down here. Not always so lucky to have someone like you around though, eh? It's the least I could do. Sorry if I scared you with a gun. It was a bit of a surprise, I'll give you that. I'm glad you had it on you though. If you are issued with firearms, be prepared to use them. So, son, what's your story? My story? Yeah, you know, how did you get here? To be honest with you, I've done enough talking for the past few hours. It's time to think now. Yeah, would you be... Would you be open to a little bit of advice from... From an old street pal like myself? Yeah, sure. Why not? One thing I have learned over all these years is that ultimately, everyone is here 'cause they chose to be here. I don't understand. At some point, no matter who we are, we'll meet people, people become part of our lives, like it or not. And when we get in trouble, believe me, we all get in trouble from time to time, eh, time to time. We have to make a choice and that choice is, do we let those people help us or not? Yeah, I think I get it now. Thank you. No problem, son. Hey, son, didn't I tell you to turn the light out when you get ready for bed? And drop cocks on socks, lights out. Here you go, Sir. I'll be back with your snacks. That's okay, I'm not going anywhere. Cute kid. My daughter, Millie. Oh, sorry, I don't mean to be nosy. That's okay. I was just lost in my thoughts. How about you? Any family? Me, no. My career took over and I'm never settled in one place for long enough, but I do like children and I often wonder what it would be like to be a mom. I'm very much the absent dad. I get the whole traveling for work thing. Most of the time I don't mind being away. - Mm-hm. - It's just days like today, I feel like I've let her down. Oh, I'm sure you haven't. Why don't I get us both another drink and you can tell me all about it if you like? So, so, so... sorry to bother you, love... Bother you, love. I believe we have a friend. Mutual... Mutual friend needs your... Needs your help. I'm sorry, I don't have time for this. I'm really busy. It's very important, love, very important... life, - life and death important... - Okay. Life and death important. Melanie? How do you know my name? It's a long story, love. I've come a long way. At least I didn't have to go all the way up to Glasgow though, eh. Glass... How? I could murder, murder, murder a cup of tea. Yeah, murder a cup of tea. So why don't you put the kettle on and, uh... And then you can decide if you want to help our friend or not. I... brought biscuits. Oh, biscuits, biscuits. Biscuits, biscuits, biscuits. Biscuits, here. I... These are your favorites? We didn't even think you'd still be here. So, what do you say, eh? Alright, you can come in but I'm in the process of packing, alright? Oh, but the only thing, I've not packed is the kettle. Biscuits. - And you want me to... - No. No? - Come in. - Melanie. Hello. She was there. Amazing. Detective Green, welcome back. Sit down, Phil. Full of car parts. Well, yes, but the intel was... Shh, shh. Okay, okay. - Taking you off the Venom case. - John. - Sir! - Sir. See, this is what happens. When you allow yourself to become personally obsessed. As much as I believe you had the right intention, Phil, but you have wasted valuable police time and effort on this. And where are the results? But, Sir, if I may, I can explain 'cause the whole... No, Detective, you may not and that's my decision. Besides, I have another case that requires your attention and talents. Why... can't Burbank deal with that? I beg your pardon. What I mean is, I'm so close to finding out who's making Venom and where it's coming from. I just don't think now is the time to leave this. Phil, my decision is final. I'm teaming you up with Detective Burbank 'cause this has the potential to have a media frenzy over it. So, I need my best man on it because I want it done discreetly and quickly. Do you understand? Okay, Sir. What is it? Donny Martin is gone missing. He's alive, he can't be. He will be here in a minute. See for yourself. This doesn't make sense. None of this makes sense. I'll let myself out, leave you two to get reacquainted. Be nice, be acquainted. It was lovely to meet you, Melanie. Thank you. Ma'am. Thank you so much, mate. Alright, mate. I owe you for everything. [inaudible]. Well done, Sir. Thank you, Sir. Jamie? You bastard, how could you do that to me? - How could you let me think you were dead? - Mel, I'm so... So sorry. I thought we were done. As far as I was concerned, my life was done. - It was over. - No. Don't you dare... Dare try to blame this on me. I'm not. This is 100% my fault. My heart was broken and all I wanted to do was run away. When they offered me that fucking deal, like something you'd see out on a film and I took it, like grabbing a life preserver. Only I didn't know what effect it was gonna have on you or what was going to happen and I'm sorry for that. So, you're telling me, you were pretending to be Donny Martin for six months and what? No one noticed, no? I don't even know where to start, but once... But what was once a dream is now a fucking nightmare. Fuck, fuck, fuck. Jamie. - Yeah, little pig, little pig, let me come in. - Fuck, they found me. I don't know how but they found me. Listen, grab your stuff and let's go. No, we can't just run. - Do you trust me? - Come on, boys, there's no use of running today. Then grab everything and come with me. Now. - Okay. - Now. Let's go. Go, Mel. Go. Jamie. Jamie. Let go of him, leave him. Jamie. Jamie, come on. Oh, my God! - Oh, my God! - Come on. Let's go. Jamie, you okay? Come on. Let's go. Come on. Hello, Mr. Smith. The paper said there was an award. Where's my award? There's a reward, but first, we need the information. The quicker we get your statement, the quicker we can put your reward process into place. Fine, but I don't want anyone getting my money. We're the police, you'll get what you deserve. Now, you came in here saying you knew the whereabouts of Donny Martin? Yeah, last night, I just wanted a quiet night under Dossers' Bridge. Then this guy comes running over with a gun shooting at me. This guy. I ran away. I don't want to get shot. Anyway, I saw him again this morning with old Benny. We know Benny. What would Donny Martin be doing with him? How is the pie? So good. It's been about two days since I last ate. Why? 'Cause I've been held hostage and when I did escape, all I was concerned about was where to go and who to trust. You need to tell me everything, everything. I don't know everything but it seems that Donny was involved with a load of gangsters in some way. One of which was a guy called Ray, leader, and Ray invented Venom, I think. Venom? Shit, okay. Ray seems to think that Donny owes him a lot of money. - How much? - 3 million. You know the news is that you stole about three million from the record company. Yeah, it can't be a coincidence but I don't really know what it means. So, what was Donny doing? That's the deal. I don't really know. Well, that's what we need to do. We need to find out exactly what Donny was up to before he died. Yeah, but how? Someone must know something. Maybe. Yeah, maybe. See, group's manager, Jay, heavily involved with it. Yeah, it must have been him that sent them goons to my place. Of course, they don't know about Jamie's life. My life. Exactly. Benny was right. This is why I needed to speak to you. I was so lost, I don't know who to trust. I'm so sorry to ever put your life in danger. It's alright, don't worry about that now. Sorry. One other member of D5, they must know something. It's Jay's assistant, Sophie, she's too close. - How close? - Affair close, I think. She never leaves his side. We can't go to her then. How about... Let's look at this from Donny's perspective, yeah. Who is he closest to in D5? Wouldn't call any of them friends, but I felt most comfortable around Danny. Okay. Well, we need to speak to Danny then. Any ideas how? Yeah, they got a choreography session booked in today, presumably, it's still on. Excuse me, Donny Martin, can I have your autograph, please? Darling, that's not Donny. He just really looks likes him. Sorry. Right, come on. Sorry, guys. It definitely was Donny Martin, mum. So, Jay, what are we gonna do now? I think it's safe to say we will never see Donny again, don't you? So, let's continue with D4. You want us to continue as a four piece? Take That did it. Yeah, where are they? - Forgotten about. - Exactly. Mate, I'll give you two reasons. Firstly, Donny is our lead and, secondly, he's our friend. What kind of band member steals 3 million pounds from his mates? I still don't get how he did that, Jay? How did he even get access to your safe? And why have you got that much cash in there anyway? I still don't know either. But, as for the cash, you know what I'm like. I get things cheaper if I pay by cash. What's my motto? - Never pay the ticket price. - Exactly. But I guess I'm too damn trusting, that's my problem. I thought we'd just call it a day. I mean, each one of us wants to be a solo artist and I know for a fact you can manage us. I could do that, Danny, but I still think you'll be much stronger, much richer as a group. What an interesting 24 hours ha... Do... - Where's the, doc? - Sorry, doctor's not here. You'll do. God, I hate cowards. Can you believe he hasn't had the balls to face me since he let Donny go? So, guys, what happened this morning? Well, boss, Jay phoned. He's a gent with some information where Donny was. And was he there? Yeah, we traced him, but the little fuck got away. Not before I tackled him though. - The bitch ended up hitting me over the head with a brick. - So, you let him go, too? No. Clean up these bodies and find me Donny fucking Martin. - Get those bitches back to work. - Yes, Boss. Tiny, go, get them. - Hello. - Hi, Jackie, how are you? Really good, thank you. - Come and take a seat. - Thank you. Can I get you a tea or coffee? - Hello, take a seat, someone will be with you in a sec. - Thank you. Jackie, someone will be with you in a moment. Sorry. Hello. Yeah. Jamie, just about to get one. Oh, alright then. No worries. I'll come right away. Bye. Well, how did it go? Yeah, I found someone with the same bag, followed her for like three shops and then I got my chance. I've done the swap. - I don't understand. - Well, now we've got money and untraceable credit cards but we gotta be quick because it's not gonna be long before she puts a stop on them so... Don't we need a pin? Yeah, I got that when I was looking for her, didn't I? Who are you and what have you done with my Mel? Sorry, did I not tell you? You see I am Mel's look-alike, the original Mel stupidly took her place - and she died under suspicious circumstances. - Oh, right. - Mm. - Come on, you, let's go. I don't know. Something about this case doesn't work. What do you mean? Apparently, Donny stole three million pounds from a safe in Mr. Kamala's office, East London. Then he goes off the grid for 24 hours, nobody sees him. But why is that weird? We both thought he hijacked it to someone in Spain. No, he didn't; he ends up in West London. He gets washed and changed in a pub, spends the night with homeless people. So? Well, if you have three million pounds, why would you spend a night in Dossers' Bridge? And also, what happened in that 24 hours when no one saw the most famous face on the planet? It's a good point. Also, there's that guy that got his sports bag nicked, the contents of which now match Donny's description. He needed new clothes. Well, if you've three million pounds in cash, you can buy your way out of that situation. Sir, we've had another sighting. We've had four phone calls from people saying they've seen Donny in a pie and mash shop, eating and speaking with a young woman. - Where? - Right here in East London? So, he's not running away, he's returning this way. Hang on a minute. Go get me that instant report from Chigwell. What's this? A phone call came in this morning about shots fired at an address in Chigwell. Now, I didn't think they were connected at first, but now it all makes sense. You see now we know they were in Ilford. Now Ilford is right next to Chigwell and we know that Donny from our friend Mr. Smith was with our local street celebrity Benny, heading towards Chigwell. Now this is an eyewitness report from that address this morning. She said that she'd just been out walking with her dogs when she noticed a strange-looking man hanging around Melanie's house, a young girl at number 23. There was a brief conversation then she let him in. Eventually, a man in a hoodie showed up and the tramp left. About 10 minutes later, a car came around the corner; five men jumped out of it, kicked the door down, she called 999, and when she was on the phone, she heard shots fired. Right, so now we know who Donny Martin is with, Melanie Price. Wow, it's lovely, thank you. Yeah, this will keep us safe for a little while. Yep, right, you know what to do? Where are you going? I'm going shopping. Take a look at your bank, Boyd. The compensation has just been transferred. You know, it's not about the money. Ray, it's not. It's about the principle. No one steals from me. Besides, Venom is too good a product not to get. You know what I'm saying? Now speaking of which, I don't know why you're making this Venom in that piss-pot tiny little country anyway. I have my reasons. Besides, you know, you gotta admit it up until now my distribution method was flawless. This whole setup is bullshit, man. Way too public for my liking and I'm... I'm left with fucking nothing. Don't forget who you are fucking talking to, Boyd. I told you, you'd get your gear. There's a second shipment on its way to you. Well, rest assured, I got the situation totally in hand. Hello. It's me. Boyd is becoming a problem. I need this sorted out. Understood. Jamie. Why have you not done your hair? I want my color. You can't deny, it works for me, didn't it? Yeah, I changed my look quite a bit lately. That hurt? A little bit. Oh, don't worry about your money. I transferred it back into your account with a little handling fee for me. Perfect. Boyd was really getting on my nerves. See you soon, April. I've got it. You were right. A lady in Ilford had her bag stolen. Now since then, her credit card's been used at a shop and a couple of ATMs. It's just been used at a hotel down the road from here. You stay here. I will get them. - Sergeant? - Sir. You're with me. You know what, Mel, you were spot on. How'd you know all this stuff? It's just common sense, innit? They're looking for you, so, they're gonna use all the resources they can. You think the police already knew how I was dressed before? Of course, they did. Donny's world famous. That's why we had to sort out your looks, so, you can at least hide in plain sight a little while longer. And that's why we had to dye your hair, dickhead. Let's go. It's time to go. Five, six, seven, eight, and again, two, three, four, five, six. Stop, stop, stop there. Well done, no, no, no. You picked... You picked up really quickly actually. Uh, Danny. Yo. You don't know me but I am a huge fan. Okay. Go on, D. - Go make the girl's dream come true. - What can I do for you? I could have a word, could I? Yes, should we go somewhere quieter? - Yeah. - Alright, later boys. Excuse me, mate. Looking for a private room. Hello, Danny. It's me, Donny. What the fuck is going on? What are you doing? Where's my money? - Where's my fucking money? - Hey, hey, leave him, leave him. - I said leave him. - I don't have your fucking money. Jay lied to you. He lied to all of us. Please, please, just listen to us then you can do what you like, I promise. Are you aware? I've got three lads sitting in that room now, you fucking robbed. How about I ring the police? What's gonna stop me from ringing the police? Yeah, absolutely, nothing. But my friendship mean more to you than the money. Friendship, it's never been about money. It's been about you being our friend and fucking getting off and leaving us. That's the thing though, I didn't leave you. I was kidnapped. What are you talking about? Alright. I was kidnapped by a load of gangsters and I escaped. Now I'm gonna run from them, from the police, hence, the fucking image and now I'm here to find out what you know about a guy called by Ray Carter. - I don't know him. - Maybe you heard Donny mention him, you know, before the accident? Got Swiss cheese brain, remember? I told you I never fucking heard that name in my life. Damn, I thought you'd know something, Dan. What about Jay? Do you know anything dodgy he could be involved in? Jay, everything he's involved in is dodgy. Yeah, we're talking big time, illegal dodgy. What? Yeah. Well, we've always had our suspicions, but nothing concrete. What sort of suspicions? Well, think about it. For the last couple of years, any time any one of us thought about going solo, the next single seems to sell more records than ever before. But it's never just been him, has it, Donny? What do you mean? Anyone even hints about breaking the group up, it's you, it's you, Donny. Always another album, another concert, another fucking world tour. Uh... That's why I'm so pissed. I can't... I can't believe it. We... We looked after you, after your accident, we was there for you and we are... We only stayed together because it's what you wanted. Six months later, I steal all the money and go on a runner. Or so it seemed then. Listen, I promise you, hand on my heart, I didn't. Is he mad? Do know what, I believe you. I do, but it's just a lot to take in. Where the fuck do we go from here? Guys, I have just seen... Fuck. Oh, my God. Who the fuck is that? Sorry, babe, I've got to get this. Really, now? What? Jay, listen, you need to go over to the choreographers now. Brother, I'm a bit busy at the moment, yeah? I don't give a fuck what you're doing, mate. Donny's here. What? Hold him there, I am on my way. Sorry, Lou. I'll finish this audition later, yeah? I've gotta go. Fine, but I did get the part though, right? And it's Lola not Lou. Mate, where have you been? - Where is he? - I told you to hurry up, mate. They fucking got off. What do you mean he got away? About 15-20 minutes ago. I told you to fucking hurry up. How did you not know? Mate, I was getting in the shower and was getting changed. I told you on the phone. You fucking idiot. And then what? It's not my fault, he was... He was with a girl. Her name was Melanie. Yes, yeah, Melanie. He had blond hair. He changed his whole look. He's wearing a suit and he's got glasses on. Okay, well. What we gonna do? So, does anyone else know I'm here right now? Okay, I came by myself like I said. Fucking waiting for you. Alright, Danny. - I'm sorry about this, brother. I really am but... - What do you mean? D3 don't have the same ring to it, bro. What are you talking about? Jay, who is this? Don't you worry about who the fuck we are, mate? Jay, what's going on? What the fuck? What the fuck? Jay? Charlie, Oscar, 3-4-3, possible shots heard in the Bromley area, assistance required. Received. I think you got it wrong this time. Jamie, Danny was never gonna help you. Didn't you see how angry he was? No one changes their mind that quick. Anyway, we've got all the information we need now. Let's go. I hate playing catch-up on this. Every time I think I know what's going on, we end up looking like idiots. This investigation is way too public. Yeah, perhaps, but we're getting close to them. I mean, we know Donny Martin has changed his appearance again. Even so no more sightings, the phone lines have gone dead. Sir, I have some really disturbing news. The body of Danny Chambers has just been found in the music studio. Oh, my God. - What happened? - One of my men was in the area when he heard gunshots. Were there any CCTV? He was seen speaking to a man and a woman who could potentially be Donny Martin and Melanie Price. Okay, look, get the MIT squad down there. This has just become a murder investigation and Donny Martin is our prime suspect. Yes, Sir. Danny Chambers, singer with the group D5, has been shot dead at a music studio in East London. Police have no eyewitnesses but have released this CCTV footage. It shows Donny Martin and... Shh, come on. Are you sure about this, Mel? Yeah, the answers we need have got to be here. We can't keep running. Alright, but I really do feel like I'm putting my head in the lion's mouth here. Now, where do you think they kept you? Down there. One of the smaller labs. - Come on. - Go. Wait, wait, wait. What's this? You were right. - This is all connected to Venom. - Get down. Come, we'll follow her. Don't worry about Boyd. He's been dealt with. Now, is there anywhere we haven't looked? What about that, uh... That cottage he owns? The one we met at last year. Oh, I doubt it, but we could send some of the lads there to have a look if you want. What about Sophie? What does she know? Nothing. Why? Come on, Jay. I know you don't want to believe it because you like her, but, clearly, Sophie and Donny got a thing for each other. I don't believe that. And now he's running around with a different piece of fluff. Well, I suppose if she does know anything, she'll easily give him up, right? A woman scorned and all that. That's crap. What are you doing there? What are you doing? Bridget, think about it, don't do it. Go around the back and get Tiny. I've got this. Stay there. I'm gonna do your fucking job for you. Fuck, fuck. I've got three bullets left. I have got an idea. What? How good a shot are you? Sir, he's got a gun. - When? - Donny Martin. - Now, Jamie, now! Come out and face me like man. I've killed him. I fucking killed him. Jamie. Jamie, he's fine. We have got to get out of here, come on. Get in, get in. Keys, yes. Are you sure you know where this cottage is? Not exactly, no. But when I was staying at Donny's apartment, a letter or something come for him with this address on it. And how do we know the police won't be there? Well, we don't. You sure this is the right place? Looks deserted. Yeah, I think so. Well, if we can get in, let's just stay here. I'm too tired to keep running. Come on. Well, it's not just gonna be open, is it? Sorry, you were saying? Oh, you must be Jamie. Well, I suppose you're looking for answers? You found them. Two years ago, I found out that Jay was using D5's world tours - to smuggle Venom all over the world. - Yeah. We kind of worked that out for ourselves. So, Ray makes it and Jay is the distributor. But I don't get it. How did it work exactly? Well, it worked out fine, actually. Only because D5 are a hit group with a big production setup. The drugs were smuggled in through the equipment and customs never checked anything because there was always too much. So, does any of the group know? No, and that was the problem. The whole group wants to go solo, which would have put an end to the whole operation. There's no way that Jay would have allowed Ray to know that his distribution route was under threat. Otherwise, Jay was a dead man. So, Jay pulled you in to help convince the group to stay together. Exactly. Jay trusted me because of my relationship with Sophie. Jay believed if I had a steady girlfriend, my group career and my solo career, well, would be finished. So, for the next year, we played our parts trying to keep the group together, making Jay feel like he could trust us. However, in secret, we were planning a way out. The car crash. That was your way out. It was the only option left and it was all staged anyway. Even the paramedics that took Donny away, that was my brother in the hired vehicle. It was perfect, the only person that Jay needed to speak to at the hospital was Sophie. We didn't need to get the doctors involved or anything. The only thing it cost me was my beloved car. But that was okay because Sophie was gonna steal three million out of Jay's safe that night which, obviously, was enough for us to disappear and well, start again. The three million pounds was Jay's cut from one of his latest distribution deals. Donny had given it to Jay after meeting a guy in America called Boyd. And Jay was meant to deliver the Venom that night but he didn't. Instead, he delivered it somewhere else and made a bigger profit for himself. We guess all this time he was planning on making Donny the patsy, blaming Donny for mucking up the entire deal and then telling Ray that he stole the money. But the car crash put a stop to that and he believed that Ray was gonna take out on him. And that's where he needed me. Yes, but you were never part of our plan, Jamie. In fact, you stopped us from getting away. The night of the accident, Sophie and I were planning to meet up here and then travel abroad, but because of Jay's harebrained scheme replacing me with you, well, Sophie got waylaid. When we finally did meet, it was too late because there's two Donny Martins in the world. My face is just too well-known, Jamie. - Yeah, tell me about it. - And it was too suspicious. Ray would have been alerted of my presence, so, I've been hiding here ever since. So, you let Jamie go through all of that just so you could run and hide. No, Sophie agreed with you. Sophie said she was best placed to protect Jamie. Until I got kidnapped, yeah? Well, fearing the worst, we reverted back to our original plan and that's why I stole the money from Jay's safe that night. He was so flustered trying to work out how you did it though. Managed to escape from Ray and then steal the money. And, in the meantime, you just waited it all out here. You guys expecting someone? Got 'em. It's Jay. Sophie, take them through the passage. Okay, guys, this way. And what about you? I'll stall him. About time I face up to this idiot. Take this. There's only one bullet left but that might be all you need. Sophie, take the money. I'll catch up with you. Jay, come in. It's nippy out there. You thought you got away, didn't you, boy? You may have killed Ray, but we've got some unfinished business. Why don't we sit down and talk about this? Where's the girl? Oh, Mel. She couldn't take it anymore, so, I left her with her parents before I came here. That's good, though, kinda poetic really. I made you, now I'm gonna end you. Oh, where's my money? Well, wouldn't you like to know how I got it first? Keep going, girls. I ain't sure how much time Donny can buy us. I don't believe that. You expect me to believe your plan was to get kidnapped by Ray? I don't care if you believe it or not because it's the truth. And I'm kind of done with all this now. So why don't you shoot me? Come on, shoot me. What are you waiting for? Shoot me? In good time, boy. Accident or suicide? Or I'll blow you up. You know what? It's quite funny seeing you squirm. I never really liked you, Jamie. Donny and I were very good friends. You know why? Because he had a backbone. That's the big difference between the both of you. Well, I still have the guts to take on another man's life. Guts? That's stupidity. You can take that to the grave with you, boy. Hang on. Danny said you have blond hair. When did you get a chance to dye it back? I didn't. Donny, it's you. How? Yeah. It is, but now you'll never know and you could take that to your grave. It is with much regret that we have decided to cease performing as D5. We all felt it wasn't right to continue without Jay or Danny as we were a group and a group just wouldn't feel the same without them. However, we are still gonna perform but as solo singers. And we are still signed to the same record label, headed up by our beautiful new manager, Sophie Peterson. Donny, there's been so much speculation in recent weeks regarding your disappearance and Danny's death. Can I just ask if any of these rumors are true and if you could shed any light on them for us, please? Sure, it's pretty simple actually. First of all, my disappearance had nothing to do with Danny's death. We really get into the world of conspiracy theories there. The truth is I had a bit of a relapse after my accident. I needed to get away for a rest. But what about the CCTV footage of a blond man who looked like you? I don't know. The police investigated it and they said they drew no leads; however, they did find evidence for my ex manager being connected to the big Venom epidemic. They said it was this reason that Danny lost his life. Is this also why police believe Jay Kamala took his own life in a gas explosion at your country retreat? Once again, I don't know. We can only presume. Look, I wasn't gonna say anything, but we want to put what went on behind us. Everybody knows whatever happened had nothing to do with any of us. We're here looking forward, on to bigger and better things and in that spirit, I'd like to introduce to you a woman I met during my sabbatical. Melanie Price, my fiancée. Give her a kiss. Give her a kiss. Ladies and gentlemen... Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for coming down. That's it for today. Please do watch out for Dylan's new single which is out next week. Thank you. Boys. Hey, you okay? - Yeah. - Well, Jamie... - Shh! - Sorry. Donny. I guess this is goodbye. Look, I just wanted to say that with your testimony we got everyone involved and closed down the entire Venom lab. And you're sure he can still carry on being Donny Martin? Of course, I mean, now, you're doing it properly. Legally, you're still Jamie Poulton and Donny Martin's just a stage name. I think Donny would have liked to know his career carried on after his death. What if I get caught? Well, as I said, there's little to no evidence that anyone else was in the cottage with Jay. And besides, we're not gonna tell anyone the truth, are you? - Look out for him. - I will. Well, Mel. It goes to show I was right all along. What do you mean? Everyone doubted I could make it as a solo artist. Now look. Eight months later, not only have I been a part of a world-famous boy band, signed a solo record contract, and single-handedly brought down a Venom drug ring. - Uh! - Kidding. You helped a little bit. Anyway, what's the time?
