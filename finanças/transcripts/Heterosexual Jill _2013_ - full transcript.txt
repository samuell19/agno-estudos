We need to wait two days. DAVID: Two days? How about I come back in an hour? JAMIE: What? No no no - you gotta hear me out. We got to wait two days because I've never seen a...you know, and it needs some time. Too soon. DAVID: I'm coming back later. JAMIE: It's too soon. Hi. GLEN: Alright Jamester, we're going to go again. Now remember what I said about enthusiasm and commitment. This is going to be the best mockumentary about cat actors that the world has ever seen.

SANDY: Jill, how long has it been since you and your boyfriend Jamie broke up? JILL: It'll be four years next week. SANDY: And you haven't dated anybody since. JILL: ...No. SANDY: Any thoughts of women? Relapses? JILL: ...Sometimes. GINGER: You know what I did to convince myself that I wasn't a lesbian anymore? I made a date with my ex-girlfriend. Just to close that chapter before moving on. And you know what? It actually worked. One last fling with her and I never looked back. SANDY: I find that unscrupulous at best and dangerous at worst. Ladies, attraction is a beast that needs to be tamed, not taunted. Jill, I think going out and finding another man to date is the best course of action for you. It's important that you keep your willingness. That you don't close that door on possibility. We are all rooting for you to be heterosexual, Jill! Yeah? GROUP: Jill! Jill! Jill! Jill! Jill!

JILL: I'm stalking you. I'm kidding! I'm just kidding. I'm kid... Yeah, I was just in the neighborhood, and I - you know. Can I come in? I'm harmless. Really. Go ahead, search me. Pat me down. Feel me up. JAMIE: Do you want something to drink? JILL: Yeah...do you have water? JAMIE: Yeah. JILL: I'll have some of that. Thanks. So you moved, huh? JAMIE: Uh huh. JILL: How's what's her name? Psycho roommate girl? JAMIE: Lola. JILL: Right, Lola. JAMIE: She's fine. JILL: Does she live here? JAMIE: No. JILL: Thank you. Mmm. Oh that's good. What kind is it? JAMIE: Tap. JILL: Mmm. Jamie, I have something I need to ask you. Why don't you come sit. Ok, I know you had your reasons for deceiving me. JAMIE: Jill, I wasn't deceiving you. I got cast as a man in a film. They had me sign a confidentiality agreement, they told me that if I told anybody - JILL: Listen, it doesn't matter why you were deceiving me. The fact is that you were. JILL: What is that? Did you just have surgery or something? JAMIE: Yeah. JILL: Maybe I should have been able to read the signs. But when you tried to seduce me - JAMIE: Ok, wait - no, you seduced me. JILL: I don't think so. JAMIE: No, I'm pretty clear on this. You seduced me. JILL: Do you think I have that kind of power? JAMIE: I wouldn't...I wouldn't say "power"... I mean, you know. JILL: Jamie, if I were a lesbian I would be totally in love with myself too. So it's OK - I get it. Stop trying to seduce me! JAMIE: It was an accident. JILL: You say accident, I say Freudian slip. JAMIE: You can go at anytime, you know. JILL: I have a favor to ask you. I came up with a plan that's going to solve all of my problems. JAMIE: Uh huh. JILL: I think we should date. I think we should date so that I know I was only attracted to you as a man and not as a woman. So what do you think? JAMIE: ...No. JILL: You don't have to make a decision right now. You know what? Sleep on it. JAMIE: No. JILL: Ok, I should get going. JAMIE: Jill - JILL: Thank you so much for the water. It was really good! Thank you. Bye! Call me! JAMIE: She's the craziest person I've ever met. I mean, come on. David - who does that? Who wants to date a lesbian to turn themselves straight? DAVID: I thought you were in love with her anyway. JAMIE: She's crazy. DAVID: Well the crazy ones are always the best in bed. JOSÉ: One minute to places! DAVID: How about one minute at your place. JAMIE: This film is such a friggin' joke. DAVID: What is that bitch doing. He's gay, you know! And he's mine. JAMIE: Do you think I owe this to her? DAVID: Who? JAMIE: Forget it. DAVID: Jill? JAMIE: I kinda feel like I messed up her brain or something. DAVID: Because you lied about not having a pussy? JAMIE: Yeah, you're a pussy. JILL: Jamie used to lie a lot, and that was really painful. I even thought I was in love with him. So I needed to see him to sort things out. Wipe the slate clean so that I could really move forward with other men. So I went to his apartment last Saturday, and I - SANDY: Hi there. Are you here for better day tomorrow? JAMIE: Ex-lesbians? SANDY: Yes, welcome. Have a seat. JAMIE: Thank you. SANDY: Sure. We started a little while ago, but if you'd like to introduce yourself before we continue. JAMIE: Sure. My name's Stephanie. LeBlanc. You can call me Ms. LeBlanc. Or Stephanie's probably fine. Anyway I'm not an ex-lesbian, just a real lesbian. SANDY: So are you a pre-ex-lesbian? JAMIE: No, just a pre...futuristic lesbian. Or a post....modern lesbian. But I have a friend who's an ex-lesbian and I'm convinced it's a phase. SANDY: Is that right. Well let's just see if we can broaden your viewpoints a little bit. Welcome, Stephanie. GROUP: Welcome, Stephanie. JAMIE: Thank you. SANDY: Now Jill here was just telling us about her ex-boyfriend Jamie. JAMIE: Oh - well I'm sorry to have interrupted. SANDY: Not a problem. She was just telling us how she showed up at his apartment after having not seen him in four years. JAMIE: Oh...four years is a long time, Jill. To still be thinking about him. SANDY: It is never too late to rekindle an old flame with an eligible bachelor. Isn't that right, ladies! GROUP: That's right!! JAMIE: He must be quite a catch, Jill. SANDY: Any man we can catch is worth catching. Isn't that right, ladies! GROUP: That's right!! SANDY: So you went to his apartment... JILL: Yep, and that's it. That's the end of the story. SANDY: Well was he there? What did he say, what did you say? JILL: No, he wasn't there. SANDY: Ok then...good for you, for taking that first step toward getting back on track with your heterosexual life. Alright, we have a few minutes before break. If you'd all just sit back please. Close your eyes, relax. We'll start with a few deep breaths. Inhale... and exhale... Inhale... and exhale... I like the dick, pussy be gone. GROUP: I like the dick, pussy be gone. I like the dick, pussy be gone! SANDY: Balls. GROUP MEMBERS: Cunt. Penis. Lactose intolerant. Erect penises in my mouth. Jello! Tahini. Penis. Hummus. Melty cheese! Coal miners. Wet pussy! Yes! Rectum. JILL: What are you doing here?! JAMIE: I wanted to check it out. JILL: This isn't a joke, Jamie. JAMIE: I'm not laughing, Jill. JILL: I would like it very much if you would leave. JAMIE: I'm going to stay until I get my turn. JILL: What are you going to say? JAMIE: You'll see. JILL: Don't embarrass me. JAMIE: You'll see! SANDY: So Stephanie, would you like to tell us a little more about your friend? Stephanie? Stephanie! Would you like to tell us about your friend? JAMIE: Uh - yeah. Yeah, sure. So my friend...ish, came to me the other day wanting me to help her with her ex-lesbianism. Call me old-fashioned, but I really don't believe in this stuff. I believe that God created lesbians. God created man, and He created woman, but He also created two women, hence lesbians. MEMBER Yeah, but he made it so their parts don't match. JAMIE: What do you mean? They match perfectly. They're like a pair of furry slippers. MEMBER: God did not create two women. He created Adam and Eve, and they had kids. JAMIE: Yeah, but Adam and Eve had two boys. Where did their wives come from? MEMBER: Their wives weren't lesbians. JAMIE: John 18:12, and on the seventh day, God created lesbians. MEMBER: You're an idiot. SANDY: Stephanie, this is a secular group. We try to help women become heterosexual outside of conventional religious teachings. JAMIE: How come? SANDY: Well ex-lesbians come from all different faiths. And some from no faith at all. JAMIE: Oh. I guess that's kinda cool. SANDY: So how did you leave things with your friend? JAMIE: Well I told Jill....O. Jill-O. That I don't know if I could help her do something that's so unnatural. JILL: What's so unnatural about wanting to be happy? JAMIE: But what does being straight have to do with being happy? JILL: Maybe being accepted, maybe fitting in. Maybe not having to be ashamed, maybe not having to hide. Maybe not having your friends and family desert you for being some kind of freak. Not everyone's life was like yours. Some of us didn't have it so easy. You can't compare your life to mine, or anyone else here. You can't even begin to compare those things. DAVID: You are so whipped. JAMIE: I just think that maybe I can help her, you know? I mean maybe she'll end up a lesbian or maybe she won't, but I feel like either way she just needs my help to get out of this limbo. DAVID: You just want to get into her pants. JAMIE: Yeah right David, I wouldn't touch her with a 10 foot pole. DAVID: But you would if it was 9 inches! Eh? Get it? See what I did? JAMIE: Yeah, hmm. More like 4. DAVID: OK mine is at least 5 or 6! JAMIE: I don't want to know about it. DAVID: You brought it up! (Lola and José talk in Spanish) DAVID: She's such a hussy. JAMIE: Don't I know it. DAVID: Tell her to keep her hands off my man! (talking in Spanish). JOSÉ: Hi. JAMIE: Hey. LOLA: Hey. (talking in Spanish). JAMIE: Oh don't let me interrupt. I'm just walking by. So Spanish. Flavor of the month, is it? LOLA: Excuse me? JAMIE: Well, it's obvious what kind of tactics you have. First German, now Spanish. I'd say it was clever but I don't think that it is. LOLA: I like languages. JAMIE: José's gay anyway. LOLA: No he's not. JAMIE: Don't start. LOLA: Don't start what? He's not gay. He winked at me. JAMIE: Oh he winked at you. You know I do expect more from you than that. LOLA: Not all effeminate men are gay. JAMIE: Ok, here we go... LOLA: Well it's true. JAMIE: Ok I'll give you that, Lola. Not all effeminate men are gay. The rest are from Europe. But since José is from Mexico, he's actually exempt under that clause. You think that's funny? LOLA: It's kinda funny. You're still an asshole though. JAMIE: What did I do? I never did anything. LOLA: That's right. You never did anything. JAMIE: That's the end of this conversation. LOLA: Have you found anyone desperate enough to date you yet? JAMIE: Yes, I did. JILL: Hi. What's that? JAMIE: It's a rose. JILL: What are you doing with it? JAMIE: I thought you wanted this to be like a real date? JILL: Yeah, a real lesbian date. Try again. Jamie, when was the last time you gave a girl flowers? JAMIE: I gave my mom flowers for Mother's Day. JILL: Exactly. So plant that in the ground and try again. JAMIE: You can't plant - ugh. I've given girlfriends flowers before, OK? And my friend gives her girlfriend flowers every week, so you just can't - JILL: And take off that ridiculous tie! Who is it? JAMIE: It's your lesbian date. I'm wearing a backpack and carrying a BPA-free refillable water bottle. JILL: Jamie, we are not going on a hike. And a real lesbian would never knock. A real lesbian would use the keys that I gave her. JAMIE: Jill - JILL: Let's do that. It's the big silver one. The big silver one! JAMIE: They're all big and silver! JILL: It's this one. JAMIE: Jill, I'm a lesbian - a real one. I don't know what you've been doing, but I'm a real lesbian and we don't do any of this, so get your purse - we're going! JILL: A real lesbian woman who takes charge. I like it! Alright! JAMIE: Let's go. JILL: Ok! What, nothing? JAMIE: What do lesbians say when they go out on a date? You tell me Jill. JILL: I don't know - you're the lesbian. JILL: Rule #1 - I call all the shots. Rule #2 - First base only. Rule #3 - No means no. Do you know what that means? It means that if you make a move and I think it's too much, and I say no, that means you have to back off, OK? JAMIE: Yeah, I got it. JILL: Rule #4 - have fun being my last lesbian girlfriend! Because we're going to get married! LOL - we're so not getting married. We're breaking up as soon as I'm ripe for the heterosexual picking. JILL: Women are pigs. BARTENDER: You should try dating men. JILL: I've tried. Tried with no success. BARTENDER: Well you know what they say - If at first you don't succeed - try, try, try again. Then quit. 'Cuz there's no point in being - you know, dumb about it. JAMIE: Ooh - look at that. The bartender's flirting with you. JILL: Who, Yentl? She's not my type. JAMIE: You sound disappointed. JILL: Ok, here's to...us. May our relationship be short and to the point. May it end effortlessly and painlessly, and - oh shit! JAMIE: What? JILL: Shit, shit, shit... JAMIE: Uh, hello? JILL: Shhh. Don't talk to me! I'm not here! I'm sorry - I'm so sorry. I think I dropped my quarter. JAMIE: It's OK...honey. Come back up - I have more quarters. JILL: Is she still there? JAMIE: Who? JILL: The girl with the red tank top and the huge big boobs. JAMIE: Ohhh.... JILL: She's in my ex-lesbian group. JAMIE: Ohhhhh.... JILL: What is she doing doing? JAMIE: Probably the same thing you are. JILL: Here. Go try to buy her a drink. Flirt with her or something. JAMIE: Why? JILL: Because I want to know what she's doing here. JAMIE: What if she recognizes me from the meeting? JILL: Jamie, don't flatter yourself. All you dykes look the same. JAMIE: That wasn't nice! JILL: Just go! JAMIE: Not until you tell me that I'm a unique and original-looking lesbian, Jill. JILL: Jamie... JAMIE: Fine. JAMIE: Hey. RUBY: Hi. JAMIE: How's it goin'. RUBY: It's going.... JAMIE: Yeah? RUBY: What's your name? JAMIE: Jamie. RUBY: Ruby. JAMIE: Oh, Ruby - that's very nice. RUBY: It rhymes with booby... JAMIE: Huh? RUBY: Did you come here alone? JAMIE: No, I came with my friend. She's straight. Are you straight? RUBY: What do you think? JAMIE: I think you're...very pretty. RUBY: Jill?? JILL: Let's go. JAMIE: I'll call you. JAMIE: Woah, wait - stop. Stop. JILL: Why? JAMIE: Because you're drunk and you're going to regret this. JILL: I'm not drunk. JAMIE: Then I'm going to regret it. JILL: You don't think I'm sexy? JAMIE: You're very sexy, Jill. But you're also a little nuts. You're a little crazy. And this is counter-productive to whatever you want to do. JILL: Just fuck me. JAMIE: No! JILL: Please? JAMIE: Jill...no... JILL: Pretty please with a cherry on top? JAMIE: No means no. Remember? Your rules? JILL: You're no fun. Male Jamie was so much more fun. He was up for anything! JAMIE: Yeah well, he didn't have sex with you either. JILL: Well he had a heart problem and that was a whole other issue. Do you have a heart problem? JAMIE: I don't, no. JILL: No? What was his problem then? JAMIE: His problem was he had boobs. JILL: Oh...man boobs. Those aren't sexy. JAMIE: No, they're not sexy. JILL: But lady boobies are! JAMIE: Ok. Right. Yeah. You know what? God gave you some lady boobies so you could enjoy them all by yourself. So you don't need me there! JILL: Oh yeah? JAMIE: Yeah, just...no no no. JILL: OH YEAH!!! JAMIE: Ok, why don't you lay down? JILL: Oh yeah? With you on top of me? JAMIE: With a blanket on top. JILL: What's the blanket going to do? JAMIE: It's going to keep you warm. JILL: Like hot? JAMIE: Sure. JILL: Very hot? JAMIE: Yeah. JILL: Yeah! JILL: Why is my shirt off? JAMIE: You took it off. JILL: Did you touch my boobs last night? JAMIE: No! JILL: Oh. Did you want to? JAMIE: Your shirt's on the living room chair. JILL: Thanks, I saw it. Did you want to touch my boobs last night? JAMIE: You can go put it on. JILL: Jamie, just because you're a lesbian doesn't mean everything has to be sexual. A bra's basically like a bikini top. JAMIE: Yeah, and a pussy's a patch of hair. JILL: Not mine; I shave. JAMIE: Ok...do you want some coffee, Jill? JILL: Yes please. JAMIE: Hand me the mug by you. I'll pour some in there. JILL: So this guy, a couple of days ago, he came up and he was like - "Does the carpet match the drapes?" And I was like - "Hard wood floors, baby!" I don't wear underwear either. JAMIE: Don't your pants get gross? JILL: Why would they get gross? JAMIE: Cream? I meant in your coffee. Do you want cream in your coffee. JILL: Jamie, you need to lighten up. God you're a prude. JAMIE: Cream, sugar? JILL: Yes please. Both. JAMIE: I'm surprised you're not hungover. JILL: Did we kiss last night? JAMIE: Yes. JILL: Did I like it? JAMIE: Well, since you are a sex-starved lesbian... JILL: I am not sex-starved. I've gone five years without sex. Big deal. I've gone longer without carbs. Let's kiss. Let's kiss! Get on my lap. JAMIE: I'm not sitting on your lap! JILL: Get on my lap. I want to know what it's like. JAMIE: You haven't even brushed your teeth. JAMIE: How did I let you talk me into this. JILL: You don't even know what we're going to do. JAMIE: It doesn't matter. JILL: Ok. This is good. Promise me that you'll kiss me whenever I say go. JAMIE: No. JILL: Jamie, this is part of it. You've kissed me before so it shouldn't be a problem doing it again. JAMIE: Yeah, like the time you spit afterward? JILL: I was trying something. JAMIE: Are you going to spit afterward? Because if you're going to spit afterward, I don't want to do it. That's just insulting. JILL: I'm not going to spit afterward. JAMIE: So you're going to swallow? JILL: Don't be gross. JAMIE: Do you think you'll ever give a guy a blow job? JILL: Don't be gross! JAMIE: I won't. Thank God. Oh, God. That shit stinks. JILL: Yeah, it does. Ok - go! JAMIE: What are you doing? JILL: Aversion therapy. JAMIE: Oh my God. JILL: What, you have a better idea? JAMIE: I do. Yeah, come here. JILL: Ok. OW! JAMIE: Oh, I think it's working. JILL: That wasn't nice. JAMIE: Come here, let's try it again. I think this is really going to help. JILL: Ok, yeah. JAMIE: Ow! JILL: Yeah. JAMIE: Yeah! JILL: Yeah. JAMIE: Yeah! JILL: OW!! JAMIE: Come on, straight girl. Aversion therapy. This is very effective I think. JILL: Take that! What is that? What is that? JAMIE: I'm doing my defense. JILL: You're doing your chicken dance. You're not even fighting. JAMIE: It's my defense. JILL: It's my defense! JAMIE: You got to admit, last night was way more fun. If that dumpster and Girl Club had a fight, that dumpster would so kick Girl Club's ass! No, no, no - Girl Club would so kick the dumpster's ass! JILL: Jamie, I've been thinking - JAMIE: Hey, would do you get when you offer a blonde a penny for her thoughts? JILL: I know that we're not in a real relationship - JAMIE: Change! JILL: But I think the both of us should start taking it more seriously. JAMIE: I'm taking it seriously. JILL: Good. Then you'll have no problem being exclusive. No Ruby, no hot girls. JAMIE: Why can't I have any hot girls? JILL: Because that makes me feel jealous, and that makes me feel like a lesbian. So no hot girls. And no un-hot girls either. And no boys. JAMIE: Gross. JILL: And no Lola. JAMIE: Lola's not even human. JILL: Well I thought maybe you guys had a thing. JAMIE: Yeah we used to. But it's over. JILL: Do you still talk? JAMIE: Yeah but even when we do talk, I just try to insult her and make her feel bad. JILL: What happened? JAMIE: Nothing really. It just didn't end well. She doesn't think I'm good enough for her. She doesn't think I'm smart enough. JILL: She said that? JAMIE: Yeah, kind of. She used to talk during sex. JILL: Like dirty talk? JAMIE: No, talk like quote facts and stuff. JILL: So that's why you guys broke up. The sex was bad. JAMIE: It wasn't bad. I mean, how bad could it be. JILL: I've had some really bad sex. JAMIE: Yeah? With men? JILL: No. Not yet. JAMIE: Yeah me neither. Not yet, not ever, never, for as long as I live, so God help me! JILL: That's pretty closed minded. JAMIE: Closed minded? Don't fucking get me started on closed minded. JILL: If you're referring to me, I am not closed minded. I am just strong willed. JAMIE: Strong willed in a lesbian way. JILL: No, strong willed in a...Hillary Clinton way. JAMIE: You do realize that you just said the exact same thing I did. Ok, good. As long as you realize. It's the same as yours. JILL: I know. DAVID: Ooh - quinoa's on sale. JOSÉ: I like your shirt. DAVID: Thank you. JOSÉ: It fits you well. DAVID: Thank you! JAMIE: Thank you! DAVID: Shut up. What am I supposed to say? JAMIE: I don't know - want to fuck? DAVID: You're such a dude. JAMIE: You're such a girl. DAVID: Is that pot? JAMIE: No, dumb ass. It's catnip. Oh. LOLA: Hello David. Hello Jamie. I did some research. Yesterday at 8:24am, José made himself a cup of coffee. Black. Only straight men drink black coffee. JAMIE: Oh come on. LOLA: 9:30 am - José makes himself a regular bagel, not the low carb kind. And he uses regular cream cheese, not light. JAMIE: So? LOLA: 10:15 am - José says to Time, and I quote "I could jump start your car blindfolded with my hands tied behind my back." 11:30 am - JAMIE: Wait a minute, Lola. Since when do you believe in stereotypes? LOLA: Jamie, I think if you're honest with yourself about this, you'll see that you're just jealous that I've moved on and you haven't. JAMIE: Oh really? OK. Well then why don't you tell that to Jill? Because she spent the night on Saturday. LOLA: No she didn't. JAMIE: Yes she did! And she's good in bed, too - just like you always were afraid of! LOLA: I wasn't afraid! Why would she say that? I mean, how immature does one need to be. Really. DAVID: José likes my body in this shirt. LOLA: Did Jamie ever tell you if I was good in bed? DAVID: No. I mean...yes? LOLA: She's just jealous. I mean, José gay? Come on. If that man's gay, then I'm... I don't know - what would I be? DAVID: A hussy? LOLA: Ok, sure. If he's gay, then I'm...a hussy. You don't think he's gay, do you? DAVID: I think he's in love with me. LOLA: Yeah. Sure. JAMIE: How much time do we have left? JILL: Well, you just ruined it. JAMIE: Good job, Jill. We did good. We didn't kiss - you're on your way to being straight! JILL: I know. JAMIE: I think you can win at this. JILL: Well I am straight - not on my way. JAMIE: Right, of course. What are you doing in bed with me? JILL: It's like a sleepover. JAMIE: We should like braid each other's hair and stuff. JILL: Well I have a feeling you don't know how. JAMIE: I can braid hair. JILL: Really? JAMIE: Yeah. JILL: Ok, well we'll do that - JAMIE: I don't think I want too, though. I'd rather go to the strip club. Wouldn't you want to? Wouldn't you rather do that? We'll have fun. We'll get you drunk and get you a lap dance. JAMIE: Yeah show us your vagina! DAVID: Yesterday, 10:51am - José smiles at me and not Sarah, who was closer to him in proximity. LOLA: That's just because Sarah's a bitch. DAVID: 11:28am - José sits down and crosses his legs, but keeps them together. LOLA: That's just a cultural difference. DAVID: Ok, 12:45pm José makes himself a salad. He uses light salad dressing. A diet salad? Really? LOLA: That's because he gained so much weight from all the bagels. JAMIE: Why don't one of you wimps just ask that guy out on a date? LOLA: This is more fun. Besides - I'm winning. DAVID: That's because you totally discounted everything that happened yesterday. LOLA: Yesterday was an anomaly. José is getting a cold. DAVID: So? He still bought that scarf at some point, and has it in his wardrobe. LOLA: Well today he's wearing socks that don't match his outfit. DAVID: They're black. LOLA: Exactly. And his pants are off-black. JAMIE: You guys are dumb. LOLA: Not as dumb as you in that outfit. Sparkle buns. Hello, 1984 called and they want their outfit back... JAMIE: Well you seem to know from experience. JILL: I'm not bisexual. JAMIE: Why not? JILL: Because I'm not attracted to men. Except - I was attracted to male Jamie. JAMIE: Yeah, I know. Male Jamie was the love of your life and I'm a huge disappointment. JILL: Don't say that. JAMIE: Can we go to sleep now? JILL: Jamie, don't say that. You're not a disappointment. JAMIE: Can we just go to sleep now? JILL: What's wrong? JAMIE: Nothing. I'm just tired. JILL: You look sad. JAMIE: I'm just tired. JILL: Look at me. JAMIE: I don't think that we should do this. JILL: You don't want to? JAMIE: I don't want to if you don't want to. JILL: I want to. JAMIE: Hey. JILL: Hi! Want some eggs? JAMIE: Yeah, that sounds good. Um...what are you doing today? JILL: Just running errands, looking for work. JAMIE: Cool. Sounds fun. Pretty good day lined up. JILL: I'd kiss you, but I haven't brushed my teeth yet! JAMIE: Yeah, it's not a problem...I mean uh... you know uh...me too! Me too... JILL: Why are you being weird? JAMIE: I just um...I just...want to make sure you're OK with everything. JILL: Yeah. I'm OK. JAMIE: Good. Because it doesn't need to mean anything. I'm not saying that it doesn't mean anything to me. I'm just saying that it doesn't need to. It could. But it could not, too. I mean, it is what it is. Or it's not...that. JILL: You're pretty cute when you stammer. Pretty cute! JAMIE AND DAVID: AAAAAAAAHHH!!!!!! DAVID: Why are you still here?! JAMIE: Who does that?! DAVID: We need five days! Five days before we can see each other! JAMIE: Who masturbates in an unlocked bathroom?! DAVID: No one ever uses that bathroom! JAMIE: I use that bathroom! You know that I use that bathroom! DAVID: The lock's broken. JAMIE: I know it's broken, that's why I like using it! It keeps everyone else away from using it, David! You picked an unlocked bathroom to masturbate in. Who the fuck does that? You couldn't wait until you got home? DAVID: José's wearing a tank top today. JAMIE: Ew! DAVID: You asked! JAMIE: It was a rhetorical question! DAVID: Fine. Let's just forget it. Let's just stop talking about it. JAMIE: Fine. DAVID: Agreed. DAVID: Hey Guys. What's up? JOSÉ: Hey. Lola was just practicing her Spanish with me. LOLA: Hablas Español? DAVID: So I was taking this new Spanish cooking class. You should come over sometime and uh - sample. JOSÉ: That sounds delicious, thank you. Maybe Lola can come and add some flavor. (talking in Spanish) LOLA: That sounds like fun - thanks for the invite! DAVID: You know Jamie's going to be there, so you probably don't want to deal with that. LOLA: I think I can handle her. Thanks though. DAVID: Mother fucker. JAMIE: Is everything OK? JILL: Yeah, I'm fine. JAMIE: Is it OK we're going to David's? JILL: Of course. (José and Lola talk in Spanish). DAVID: So here's an idea - why don't we speak in English so we can all join in? Or I could talk in Chinese. (David talks in Chinese). DAVID: Lola, can I see you in the other room? LOLA: Why? LOLA: What is going on? DAVID: I'd like to ask you the same thing. LOLA: Ok... DAVID: You're purposely talking to him in Spanish to leave me out! LOLA: David, you're being hypersensitive. DAVID: Jamie, can you come here for a second? DAVID: Please tell Lola that talking to José in Spanish in front of us is rude. LOLA: David, this is very mature. Bringing Jamie in here to gang up on me. JAMIE: You guys, this is stupid and I'm bored. Can I go? DAVID: No. JOSÉ: Jill. Just the woman I was hoping to see. Smoke? JILL: No thanks. I quit. JOSÉ: That's good. Quitting is sometimes the best thing to do. JILL: Yeah... JOSÉ: So tell me something about yourself, Jill. What makes you tick? JILL: Oh, I don't know. Not much, really. JOSÉ: Oh come on. You're holding out on me. JILL: No, I'm probably just really boring. JOSÉ: Boring! I don't believe that for a second. You know, you have really pretty eyes. JILL: Woah! JOSÉ: Oh I'm sorry. I have mints here. It'll clear that right up. I'm sorry. JAMIE: Well I really don't think that José's attracted to either one of you guys. LOLA: Do you think he's asexual? JAMIE: No. He just thinks you're repulsive. LOLA: Jamie! JAMIE: So can I go now? I think this is settled. DAVID: No. It's not settled. We're not leaving until you're friends again. JILL: I thought you were gay. JOSÉ: Excuse me? Oh, that's funny. Me gay? Oh that's funny. JILL: Yeah... JOSÉ: Oh, you're funny. You're really funny Jill. You want a mint? JILL: No thank you. JOSÉ: Well why don't you get closer so you can smell my fresh breath. JILL: That sounds like a trick question. JOSÉ: Maybe the trick is that it's not a question. JILL: Then what if I say "no"? It must be a question if I can say "no." JOSÉ: What are you so afraid of? JILL: I'm not afraid. Maybe I just don't want to kiss you. JOSÉ: Maybe doesn't sound like a "no" to me. DAVID: Because you used to be in love, and now all you do is fight. JAMIE: That's how life works. LOLA: It doesn't need to. JAMIE: Yeah, and that's what I told you - that lesbians stay friends after they break up. But you didn't want to go along with it! LOLA: Maybe because you inherently excluded me when you said "lesbians." JAMIE: Oh, that's right. We have to give Lola special treatment because she's "bisexual." LOLA: You don't have to put it in air quotes. JAMIE: We have to have a whole special language for her, make special considerations. You're just like those people on the airplane who get their own special meal! LOLA: You can order a special meal too. JAMIE: ...I don't want to. LOLA: Then who cares? JAMIE: Yeah! Right, exactly! Who cares? We don't care. So you and all your special meal people can go form a colony on some island together, for all we care! LOLA: Do you see what I have to put up with? JAMIE: Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go home and have sex with my hot blonde girlfriend. LOLA: And I am going to go have sex with my non-asexual, hot Latin lover! DAVID: Yeah me too. JOSÉ: Jill! JILL: It didn't mean anything. JAMIE: It doesn't matter. We were never really a couple, so you can't really cheat on me. JILL: Why can't I just go to your place? JAMIE: Don't ask stupid questions. JILL: So you're just breaking up with me? JAMIE: We never had a real relationship Jill, so we don't need to break-up. JILL: Can you stop saying that? Stop saying we didn't have a real relationship. JAMIE: Well did we? JILL: Look, that was in the beginning. Things are different now. JAMIE: It's different now why? Because you have sex with me, and now you're such a huge dyke that you can't even keep your hands off other men. JILL: Look, I freaked out about last night. And I was talking to José and he smelled really nice. I think he wears your cologne. JAMIE: Oh right. Yeah, and the cologne confused you - of course, I understand Jill. JILL: Look, I made a mistake. JAMIE: Right, because you're obviously blind and deaf and you need to rely on your keen sense of smell to lead you to your mate. I mean, it could've happened to anybody, really. JILL: What do you want me to say? I'm confused. I'm fucked up. I made a mistake! JAMIE: Yeah well, now you can make all the mistakes you want. But you're not going to do it with me. JILL: Fine. JAMIE: José's gay anyway. JILL: Good. Then I guess we belong together!!! DAVID: José's wearing a tank top today. JAMIE: Ew! DAVID: Jamie, I'm getting so desperate, you're starting to look good to me. JAMIE: AAAAAAAAHHH!!! JAMIE: Ha ha Howard. This is so hilarious. You're so funny, Howard. You gotta - stop making me laugh, ha ha. GLEN: Cut! James, come with me. GLEN: James, what is going on today? JAMIE: I just have some girl trouble. GLEN: PMS? JAMIE: No Glen. Trouble with girls. I slept with this girl. She's an ex-lesbian. And - GLEN: And Howard reminds you of her. JAMIE: No. GLEN: I'm sorry about what you're going through. But this isn't about you. This is about Howard. Our whole day revolves around Howard. This whole movie revolves around, who? JAMIE: Howard. GLEN: Howard. And you know what the greatest thing about Howard is, Jame-O? JAMIE: What. GLEN: It's the purity in his heart. When you look at his face, doesn't it just melt your soul? JAMIE: I'm coming in. I'm coming in!! AAAAAAAAHHH!! LOLA: Jesus Jamie, calm down. JAMIE: Why do you even use this bathroom? The lock doesn't work. LOLA: I like it because no one else uses it. JAMIE: Listen Lola. I got to talk to you about something. LOLA: Can I go to the bathroom first? JAMIE: No, because - no, no, you can't! We don't have enough time before we start shooting. LOLA: Then we'll talk after. JAMIE: No, I have to talk to you about it now! LOLA: Can't it wait? JAMIE: It can not wait!! LOLA: Fine. We'll talk while I go. JAMIE: So I need to ask you about something but you got to promise not to make fun of me. LOLA: Huh? JAMIE: You got to promise not to make fun of me! LOLA: Why would I make fun of you? JAMIE: Just open the door! LOLA: Fine. JAMIE: So I recently saw David's...male anatomy. LOLA: Uh huh. JAMIE: Twice. And it was my first time seeing a real one. And it's not like seeing one in a movie or looking at the statue of David - no pun intended with that. LOLA: Uh huh. JAMIE: But I have this vision of it that won't go away. And it haunts me in my dreams at night. And there's activity. LOLA: Activity? JAMIE: You know, um...not paranormal activity. But um...sexual activity. LOLA: So what you're saying is, is that you dream about having sex with David. JAMIE: No, not with David! Just men in general. LOLA: Men in general? JAMIE: No, not men in general! Just individual, specific - can you not look at me?! So...are you done? LOLA: Yes. Let's switch. JAMIE: So this is obviously bothering me. And I want to ask you what you think it means, but I know what you're going to say. LOLA: What. JAMIE: I don't want to say it. LOLA: So you want me to say it. JAMIE: No! I don't want you to say it. I just want to tell you that you're wrong. That what you're going to say is just not true. LOLA: You don't even know what I'm going to say! JAMIE: Yes I do! LOLA: Jamie, you just broke up with Jill. JAMIE: Can you not look at me? Please! LOLA: You hate doing this movie. You fight with me every chance you get. JAMIE: You fight with me! LOLA: Would you just listen to me! JAMIE: No, because I know what you're going to say! LOLA: What am I going to say?! JAMIE: I don't want to say it! LOLA: What I am saying is, is that I think you're just under a lot of stress. JAMIE: Oh. So...what you're saying is...that it doesn't actually mean that I want to have sex with men. LOLA: No. Unless you think there's something more to it? JAMIE: No. LOLA: Ok. Because if there's more to it, then there's probably more to it. JAMIE: No. There's not more to it, Lola. LOLA: Ok. JAMIE: So does this mean that we're friends now? I know I've been kind of an asshole lately. LOLA: I know, I've been a bitch too. JAMIE: So does that mean we're both sorry and we both forgive each other? LOLA: Come here. DAVID: Sorry, I thought there would be more women here. JAMIE: I should go. DAVID: Stay for awhile, please? I don't know anyone. JAMIE: Then why don't you come with me? DAVID: Because I was hoping I'd meet someone. Sorry. About Jill. JAMIE: Now she's gallivanting with José, so there you go. Who knew we'd both get screwed by the same bitch. DAVID: You in love with her? Well, let's dance. You know, just have some fun and not think about it. JAMIE: I don't want to dance with a bunch of men. DAVID: OK it's just dancing; it's not sex. You don't even have to touch anyone. JAMIE: Why would I touch anyone? DAVID: Jamie, it's a joke. JAMIE: If you ever catch me with a man, David, you got to really do something. DAVID: Ok... JAMIE: No, I'm serious. I'm not joking on this one, David. You got to really intervene. I'm talking about major intervention. Do you promise me? DAVID: Promise what? JAMIE: That you will intervene if I get too drunk and I start mackin' on some guy? DAVID: Jamie, stop being so ridiculous. JAMIE: Do you promise me? DAVID: OK, I promise! JOSÉ: I hope I didn't interfere with things between you and Jamie. JILL: No, not at all. Jamie and I were just good friends who went down the wrong path. But let's talk about you. Tell me about Mexico. JOSÉ: Oh I'm from Brazil. JILL: Ok, tell me about Brazil. JOSÉ: Brazil is home to the Brazilian wax. Have you had one? JILL: No. JOSÉ: Oh, there're the best. JILL: Well, I shave down there. JOSÉ: No, this is way better than shaving. Plus it reaches places a razor could never go. JILL: Maybe I'll have to try it. JOSÉ: I have a home wax kit... JILL: AAAHHH! Fuck! Mmmm... JOSÉ: You like that? JILL: Mmhmm. Fuck! FUCK!! GAY DUDE: How's it goin'? RUBY: Hi. JILL: Aaaaaah! Aaaaaaah! AAAAAAAAHHH! Yeah... JOSÉ: You make me so horny when you scream. JILL: I should go. JOSÉ: I thought you liked it. JILL: No, I do. I just need to go. JOSÉ: I promise to make it feel better when it's over. JILL: I think we should take things slower. JOSÉ: It's just a wax job. I mean, you'd pay some lady 50 bucks to do what I did, plus tip. JILL: No, I loved it. It's just late and I'm tired. So let's take a rain check. RUBY: I knew you'd be back. JAMIE: Oh yeah? RUBY: I did. JAMIE: Um, let me buy you a drink. RUBY: You can buy me anything you want, as long as you don't buy your time getting into my bra. JAMIE: Huh? RUBY: Sure, whatever you want. JAMIE: Hey, we'll have a couple of drinks. Whatever you recommend. BARTENDER: How about a couple of lemon drops? JAMIE: Yeah. You want one of those? RUBY: I want you...inside of me. SANDY: So we've missed you, Jill. Anything new? JILL: I started dating a man. SANDY: Congratulations! GROUP: Congratulations, Jill! SANDY Tell us about him. JILL: He's from Brazil, and he has an accent, and he wears cologne. SANDY: He sounds perfect for you. Have you guys been to third base yet? JILL: Sort of. SANDY: And you liked it. JILL: Yes. Until I was reminded that it was him that I was with instead of my ex. Girlfriend. Jamie. Jamie is my ex-girlfriend, not my ex-boyfriend. SANDY: I see... Transformation takes time, Jill. It takes time. JILL: That's it? That's all you have to say to me? I had sexual and emotional relations with another woman, and all you have to say is that "Transformation takes time?" SANDY: I don't know what you want me to say, Jill. JILL: Why am I still here? SANDY: To become an ex-lesbian. JILL: No. Why am I still here? I've been coming to these longer than most of the other women, and everyone's moved on with their heterosexual lives! Why am I still here? SANDY: I'm not going to lie to you. Most of the women who have left, we've lost to the gay agenda. But you. You have commitment, passion, perseverance. If anybody can do this Jill, it's you. GROUP: Jill! Jill! Jill! Jill! Jilly likes the dick! Jill! Jill! Jilly likes the dick! CASSANDRA: Welcome everyone, to Reclaiming Your Lesbianism. As most of you know, my name is Cassandra, and I've been living the lesbian lifestyle for the last 30 years. Looks like we have a bunch of brand new faces, so why don't we start to my right. MARY: Hi, thanks. My name's Mary. CASSANDRA: Hi Mary. MARY: And I went to a series of ex-lesbian meetings where they showed gay male pornography. They said it would be twice as effective. You know, men times two. And it was hot. Those gay men fucking each other was really hot. I had never really seen a penis before, and now - I just can't get it out of my head. It's all I think about, is just penis. You know, it's everywhere - just penis, penis, penis! JAMIE: Can we not talk about penis? CASSANDRA: Just one moment. You'll have your chance to speak. JAMIE: Sorry. CASSANDRA: That's OK. I know penis is a sensitive topic to a lot of lesbians. JAMIE: That's right. I'm sensitive. CASSANDRA: Mmhm. Continue Mary. MARY: Anyway, I think about penis so much, I'm afraid that I may be bisexual. I wanted to be straight because being gay isn't accepted into society. But if I'm bisexual, and I love penis, then everybody hates me. So really I just want to be a lesbian again. CASSANDRA: Well you see, we try to focus here on accepting yourself into the lesbian lifestyle. We don't actually change people's sexuality. MARY: But if the porn changed my sexuality, then why can't I just find a way to change it back? CASSANDRA: I don't think porn changed your sexuality. I think it just helped you discover a hidden part of yourself. And perhaps we can help you with accepting that. RUBY: So I see you've been hanging out with that dykey friend of yours. JILL: Well I saw you rubbing your big huge boobs in her face. RUBY: Well I saw you pull her away aggressively and make out with her. Then I suppose you went back to her place for some sex, but you must not have been very good, because she came looking for me last weekend. JILL: No she didn't. What did you guys do with each other? RUBY: What does it matter to you? JILL: It doesn't. RUBY: When I didn't see you come back here, I thought you must have switched to that lesbo group. JILL: What's that? RUBY: Just some group in Hollywood that Mary joined. JILL: Does she like it? RUBY: I don't know. I don't talk to her know that she decided to go gay again. JILL: But you go to lesbian clubs and pick up on girls. RUBY: Jill, I'm a lesbo-holic. If an alcoholic goes to a bar and has some drinks, doesn't it makes sense that he would stay in AA, and not go to some wine tasting festival down the street? JILL: So does that mean you didn't have sex with Jamie? RUBY: You know, if you look sex up in the dictionary, it doesn't describe anything that lesbians do. JAMIE: She has these huge tits. Like huge beacons of light to a lost sailor at sea. And they talked to me, too. Kinda like - "wah wah wah wah." But in actual words, you know. Then she took my hand and she tried to - not really insert it inside of her, but you know - kind of put it in the region. Then I looked down at my hand and I saw this big, bulging package! Like a - like a - like a penis! MEMBER: She was a pre-op transsexual? JAMIE: No, she wasn't a transsexual! I was having visions. CASSANDRA: Ok, Jamie. It sounds to me that you have a problem objectifying women and dealing with a phobia of male sexuality. Does that sound accurate to you? JAMIE: I don't see why that's a problem. CASSANDRA: Well the first step to solving a problem is admitting that you have one. JAMIE: Well I don't. CASSANDRA: Then I'm afraid I can't help you. JAMIE: Yeah but I mean - you don't think I'm attracted to men, do you? CASSANDRA: I'm afraid I can't answer that. JAMIE: Yeah but come on, I mean have you ever met a butch lesbian who was attracted to a man? I mean guys - look at me, right? Come on! I mean come on, that would have to go in the Guinness Book of World Records or something. That'd be kind of cool. I could maybe do that...no, I couldn't do that. Anyway, so as I said, I'm basically here to meet chicks. JAMIE: Oh, I had to go. Had a booty call to tend to. Got me some pussy. DAVID: Cool. JAMIE: Yeah, you know. Just another day in the life of a lesbian, that's all. DAVID: That's good. I got myself some penis action as well. JAMIE: You know David, what you do in the bedroom is your business, but - I don't need to know about it. DAVID: You can tell me about pussy, but I can't tell you about penis? JAMIE: David, please stop. DAVID: What about cock? JAMIE: You know, I asked you to stop and now you're continuing. So it's called sexual harassment. DAVID: Oh yeah? What about dick? JAMIE: Lesbians don't like dick! DAVID: Dick? You like dick? How about dick? JOSÉ: Is your hair stubbly yet? JILL: No. JOSÉ: Can I see? Or not see. I could touch without seeing? JILL: Maybe we should start with a kiss? JOSÉ: Of course. Where are my manners. Feel this? Smooth as silk. You could eat dinner off of these babies. JILL: I should go. JOSÉ: What's wrong? JILL: This isn't working. JOSÉ: It'll grow back. JILL: I'm gay. JOSÉ: You think I'm gay? JILL: No. I'm gay. JOSÉ: But you're so pretty. JILL: So... JOSÉ: Did I do something wrong? JILL: No. JOSÉ: Is it because you think I'm gay? JILL: No. Are you? JOSÉ: Jill, how can you ask me that? Aren't I a good kisser? JILL: I don't see what that has to do with - JOSÉ: Don't I treat you like a lady? JILL: Well... JOSÉ: Didn't I seduce you like a man? JILL: Maybe you're overcompensating. JOSÉ: Maybe we should have sex. Just to make sure. JILL: I need to go. CASSANDRA: I want to guide each one of you toward a fearless approach of understanding and accepting yourselves, all parts of yourselves, no matter how much it might scare you or repulse you. Close your eyes. You're inside the belly of a whale. Now imagine what would happen if - someone left your class without asking... JAMIE: Wait - Jill! What are you doing here? JILL: No, you do not get the pleasure of knowing what I'm doing here until you tell me what the hell you're doing here? JAMIE: I'm...here to meet chicks. JILL: Don't lie to me. JAMIE: Why are you so mad? JILL: Why am I mad? The fact that you came to a support group for people who are trying to be comfortable with the fact that they're lesbians? The fact that you're such a cocky bastard who thinks she's got her shit together, and dumps me for an honest mistake, when she doesn't even know who or what the hell she even wants! JAMIE: I want chicks. JILL: Why are you here? JAMIE: I'm here to meet chicks. Chicks like you. I'm here to meet you and...and here we are. JILL: You're here because you're a hypocrite who can't even be honest with herself right now. DAVID: So did you hear that Jill and José broke up because he's gay? LOLA: That's because he's straight and Jill's gay. DAVID: That's because Jill and José are gay. JOSÉ: You think I'm gay? DAVID: Oh, José. I didn't know you were... JOSÉ: Why does everybody think I'm gay? DAVID: ...there. JOSÉ: Ladies and Gentlemen, I have an announcement to make. I am not gay! I am a heterosexual man. I love women. I love women underneath me, on top of me, naked, in the shower. I love them all the time, in all the seasons, in every way! LOLA: A straight man would never do that. DAVID: A gay man would never do that. JOSÉ: I'm starting a blog site at José not gay dot com. 18 and over only please. Thank you. DAVID: How unfortunate. LOLA: I can see you now! CASSANDRA: So what made you decide to leave the ex-lesbian group and join us? JILL: It was time. I dated a man for awhile and then I just couldn't do it anymore. A real man. Not to be confused with the man that I dated who turned out to be a woman, who turned out to be an unforgiving hypocrite, who started showing up at Reclaiming Your Lesbianism when Lord knows why, because she's supposedly she's such a die hard dyke, and she claims that she's here to meet chicks! Meanwhile, it's obvious to everyone but herself that she's too insecure to be honest about her own issues. JAMIE: Yeah well, it sounds like you're the one with the problems! CASSANDRA: Ladies, the number one rule here is respect. And rule number two is we all have problems or else we wouldn't be here. MEMBER: Yeah, and any idiot knows the best place to meet chicks it at a political rally. JAMIE: Oh. Really? MEMBER: No, they don't put out. You got to go to a bar. JAMIE: Well, not if you're looking for an emotionally committed LTR, long-term relationship. JILL: The only way that you would be emotionally committed is if you were committed to a mental hospital! JAMIE: Yeah well, the only way you could be in an LTR is if it stood for "Lesbian Traitor Retard"! CASSANDRA: Ladies! Woah, please! Ok. I think what needs to happen between the two of you is a good old-fashioned heart to heart. Right? Honesty, respect, clarity, acceptance. Do you think you ladies can manage that before the next session tomorrow? JAMIE: Yeah, whatever. JILL: Yeah, ok... CASSANDRA: Thank you! Alright, who wants to sing? Here we go. Pass that over that way. Happy place, everyone. Happy place! Pass them out. Everyone have one? Good. Let's start from the top, OK?
