[CAR ENGINE REVVING] JOANNA: God does not view sin in different levels. That was a creation of man. RICHARD: Did you come up with that? JOANNA: No. Someone else. A writer. [ENGINE IDLING] [ENGINE REVVING] [INHALES SHARPLY] [DANNY CRYING] I'm sorry. [ENGINE REVVING] [SNIFFLES] [ENGINE REVVING] [ENGINE REVVING] [INHALING SHARPLY] -[BREATHING HEAVILY] -[ENGINE REVVING] [BELLS TOLLING] [DOOR OPENS] [DOOR CLOSES] EMILY: Tony, the car is here. You've been standing at that window, staring at it all night. Emily, hon, I got it. Just meet me in the lobby. I'll be a minute. Okay? Sure. [EXHALES] Danny, what the hell. [CELL PHONE RINGING] Hello. -LOGAN: Is Tony there? -Yes, he is. But we're on vacation and we're actually trying to get away from things. Can't this wait until we get back? I'd rather not, ma'am. It's an urgent matter. It's Logan. He says he needs to talk to you right away. I think you should take it before he has a stroke or something. Hey, Tony... Sir. There's a reason why my cell phone is off. Now make it quick. We have dinner reservations in 15 minutes. Sorry to bother you, but I'm kind of freaked out. I'm not sure what to do. What's this all about, Logan? LOGAN: Well, I met with Danny last night at Belleau Street store. He, uh... He told me to come with him to his house and... uh, wait in the garage until he needed my help. So, you know, uh, I did that, but then I fell asleep. I don't know what Danny did, but he woke me up this morning, told me I had to leave right away, so I did. But he was acting real... strange, spooky, you know? -I... I think you ought to call him. -[LINE DISCONNECTS] [LINE RINGING] BILL: Tony. TONY: Bill. Really glad I reached you. I need a big favor. Danny left me a really strange message last night. I need you to get ahold of him. BILL: You got it, bud. Yeah, I'm in my truck right now. I'm heading to the gym, so I'll just swing by. I'll call you back in a few minutes. I'm sure everything is okay. Yeah, I'll check it out. Ciao, boss. Hey, stop worrying. Jeez. I have a bad feeling this time. [PERSON BREATHING HEAVILY] -[DIALING] -[LINE RINGING] [CELL PHONE RINGING] -[KNOCK ON DOOR] -[DOORBELL RINGING] BILL: Danny? Rachel? Is anybody home? RACHEL: [ON VOICEMAIL] You've reached Rachel. DANNY: Danny. EVAN: Evan. CHRISTOPHER: And Christopher. -ALL: Please leave a message. -[BEEP] Hello. Danny? [PERSON BREATHING HEAVILY] Rachel. Anybody home? Hey, it's Bill Schroeder. Can you let me in? [KNOCKING AT DOOR] Chris, where are your mom and dad? -Go. -Watch it, watch it. -Go. -Take the shot. -[MAN EXCLAIMS] -Nice shot. Airball. Uh, ball in. MAN: Attack! Attack! [CELL PHONE RINGING] MAN 1: Junior. MAN 2: Go, you go! We good! We good! CAROLYN: You have a good day, buddy, all right? Have a good soccer game. Score a goal for me. -See ya. -All right. -Bye, sweetheart. -Bye, Mom. Bye, guys! [SIGHS] Embarrassing, dude. MAN: Over here, over here! -[PHONE RINGING] -Ooh. Hey, how was your morning? MITCH: Amazing. Just heading to the office. You sound out of breath. Yeah. I almost missed Joey and Luke's pickup this morning, I'm running so late. Gotcha. Hey, did, uh... Did Danny call? He didn't... He didn't show up. Frankie, sweetheart. It's time to go. Uh... No. No messages. Not that I know of. I'm sorry. I'm trying to get Frankie out the door. [PANTING] MITCH: Okay. Yeah, hun. No worries, babe. You got a couple minutes for one of your amazing pep talks? -I need to nail this thing. -Yes, of course. -Uh, what time are they due in? -Two hours. We have an hour to pitch the, uh, entire design package. Need ten minutes, tops, babe. You're my biggest fan. Yeah, speaking of biggest fan, Rachel called, left a message while we were at dinner the other night, and, um, she passed her real estate exam, so we are going to go out this weekend and celebrate. Well, then maybe we'll all have something to celebrate this weekend. Hey, I'm just pulling up now. Okay, sweetheart. You got this. -Love you. -I love you. -Okay. -FRANKIE: I'm ready to go, Mom. [SIGHS] Bless your heart. [LAUGHS] All right, stinker. We got some work to do. -Come with me. -You don't like my shirt? [ELEVATOR DINGS] -Kate. -Hey, Mitch. Support is ready. Robert. -Good to see you. -Good to see you. -How are you? -Great. MITCH: Gentlemen, how was your flight down from... [INDISTINCT CHATTER] The way I see it, your account presents many challenges. Am I right, Kate? Tell me what you don't like about Wholesome Grocer. Better yet, I'll tell you. Parking, pricing, impulse stacking, clientele. But you're not Wholesome Grocer, and that's exactly what we want the consumer to know. The second case, we build Green Acres. Not just a TV show. [BELLS TOLLING] RICHARD: Joanna. Does your head hurt now? JOANNE: Better, love. The morning brought a small sense of relief. [WATER RUNNING] [SIGHS] [SIGHS] Thank you. Perhaps you should stay in bed today. Maybe today is not your day. [CHUCKLES] But every day is my day, you know that. Just give me a minute. [PHONE RINGING] Hey, Mom, where are you? What's going on? MOTHER: You need to sit down, sweetheart. It's about Danny and Rachel and the boys. What's going on? They okay? Rachel's gone. And one of the boys and... [SOBBING] And Danny, too. What do you mean, gone? I just... I just heard from Rachel last night. MITCH: The idea is to give the shop an organic feeling without the... crunchy granola feeling mixing the... Creative with the practical. I'm so sorry. Kate, can you take over? [INDISTINCT WHISPERED CHATTER] Kate, I guess it's your floor. KATE: Yeah, of course. MOTHER: Danny killed Rachel and one of the boys last night. They found his car in the bottom of the quarry down at St. Francisville. Police think he drove it off the edge on purpose. Mm... No, Mom, you must be mistaken. I... [CHUCKLES] That's... But they... Honey, it's no mistake. No. Danny... Danny would never hurt the kids, so... And... And if... And if Rachel was... If they were having problems, Rachel would have told me. So you're wrong. All right. We're good now. What's up? TONY: Mitch. Emily and I are on our way home right now. What happened? It's Danny. [SOBBING] No. No! No... Oh, no, no, no! No! [MOTHER SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] No! Oh, my God! No, no, no, no, no! No. Carolyn? Carolyn? MITCH: Listen, boys, there's something we got to tell you and... there's no easy way to say it. And it's gonna sound awful. LUKE: What happened? CAROLYN: I think Danny was sick. You know, like... sick in the head, in his mind. LUKE: Breakfast. And he... he hurt Rachel and Evan very badly. He... He... He killed them. And he... he couldn't forgive himself, he... He killed himself. [SOBS] Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. JOEY: Thank you. MITCH: All right, make it so, boys. All right, sir. Mom? Be right back. Tuck Foxy in. And then have Foxy tuck you in. CAROLYN: I love you. MITCH: Yeah. Thank you. You, too. Let's get you straightened up here. -Dad? -MITCH: Yes? Are we all going to heaven? MITCH: I don't know. -Good night, Mom. -Good night, my love. Good night. Hit the light. We love you, buddy. Oh, my God, please. RACHEL: Hey, sweetie, it's Rachel. What are you up to? I'm about to go take my exam. And I just was calling to get one of your famous pep talks. Also, it's raining here, and I was just wondering if it's raining there, too. It's really nasty here. Joanna? Where you going? I need to see them. I need to help. What are you going to say to them? Brief is life, but love is long. [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] MITCH: According to this report, they found Danny's car by accident. A couple of hikers came across the tracks and followed them to.... The edge of a ravine. We're lucky they even found his car. [DOOR OPENS] Mom, Dad... Um, can we sleep with you tonight? CAROLYN: Of course. Come here. Hey, look. You boys have to sleep though, right? Here, lift up, sweetheart. Let me get you under the covers. Okay. You got your daddy, right, sweetheart? -Yeah, we're good. -All right. [KISSING] ♪ Everybody listen to me ♪ And return me my ship ♪ I'm your captain Almost. Good try. [CHUCKLES] Hey, honey! What's the score, Christopher? Like Grandpa always says, "We got Luke and Evan "running like two bald guys fighting over a comb." [LAUGHTER] CAROLYN: Evan go through a growth spurt just recently? Evan's gonna be in high school before we know it. RACHEL: Don't even say that. What's up, munchkin? Best summer ever, Mom. CAROLYN AND RACHEL: Aw! -Just look at them. -So sweet. Young, innocent. [LAUGHS] Not for long. RACHEL: Oh, my gosh. Well, it wasn't always easy, but somehow we made it work, didn't we? Yes, we did. -Cheers to you. -Here's to that. [LAUGHS] What are you cackling about? Your first day. Henderson High. -Let's not... -Oh, yes, yes, yes. -Let's do. -[CHUCKLES] Um... Oh! "You look like you could use a lab partner. "I'm Rachel." [LAUGHING] -You didn't talk like that. You did not. -I do! High school. Let's not. No. So scary. [CAR ENGINE REVVING] We shall never speak of it again. [BOTH LAUGHING] Yes, we will. Hey, little man. Don't be running with no shoes on. We'll end up in the hospital again. Shit. DANNY: You ever... You ever wonder if... we end up in the right place in life? Yeah, sometimes. I don't know, maybe... maybe it's just about freedom, you know? Doing whatever you want whenever you want to do it. Being tied down... -Buy a Porche. -[CHUCKLES] Seriously, like, what do you think your life would be like if you didn't have Carolyn and the boys? You know? I don't know. I do have a life with Carolyn and the boys. I just... I don't think about it. [CAROLYN AND RACHEL CHATTING INDISTINCTLY] CAROLYN: Girls and boys have different... Oh, that reminds me. Here. I got you something for the Mustang. Ah! Are you kidding me? "If they don't know it happened..." BOTH: "It didn't happen." MITCH: "NOLA." You had this made? Nah. Found it in a tourist shop down the court. Kind of like "What happens in Vegas." You know? I don't know. Seemed appropriate. [CHUCKLES] -Hey, hands to yourself. -Thank you. -You're very good at that. -Thank you. [WATER SPLASHING] Yeah. -Careful. Wine. -Guys, there's a bottle of wine right there. DANNY: Hey! I love you, Renee. You love me, you learn my name, honey. Yeah. [LAUGHS] RACHEL: And you come over and hang out with us. [LAUGHING] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] ♪ I'm your captain Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah ♪ I'm your captain Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah ♪ I think I'd rather be doing just about anything other than meeting with a homicide detective today. I know, I know. In a weird way, it, uh... it'll be good for us. You know? We need to know all the facts. When nothing makes sense, we need to know what happened. [MITCH SIGHING GRIMLY] My best friends are dead. That's what happened. [SIGHS] I had a dream about Rachel last night. You what? Yeah. I was, uh... sitting by the pool, and I must have dozed off. When I opened my eyes, or at least I think my eyes were open, I... I could see her face. She was smiling. Laughing and... speaking, though her lips weren't moving. But it was like... she was there, but she wasn't there? And she told me to convince you to speak at her funeral and that she'll be there with you. [CHUCKLES] She came to me last night, too. [CAROLYN CHUCKLES] I think we're both just imagining things. BEN: Please accept my condolences. My name is Detective Ben Lee from the... East Baton Rouge Sheriff's Office. And you can call me Ben. I know how difficult this must be for all of you, so I'll try to be as brief as possible. Let me be clear that I can only release a limited amount of information, and I must insist that you keep the details of what I tell you to yourselves as this is an ongoing investigation. Once the media gets ahold of some of these details, they're gonna have a field day. Carolyn. -Bill. -Mitch. ANNA: Hi. I'm so sorry. BILL: You know Anna? ANNA: Mitch. MITCH: Tony. TONY: Hey. MITCH: I'm so sorry. TONY: Thank you. MITCH: When did you get back? TONY: About an hour ago. -[SOBBING] -MARY ANN: Can't believe they're gone. Why did he do this? Why? BILL: Ben and I go way back. Kids played ball together. He's graciously offered to fill us in. Thanks for doing this, Ben. Ben, when I landed at the airport, I received a message from a reporter saying that Danny did not shoot Rachel or Evan. Danny did not shoot Rachel or Evan, but Danny did shoot himself. Danny didn't own a gun. Shotgun. He shot himself with it as he drove his SUV into the quarry. -[CRYING] -[SHUSHING] -[MARY ANN SOBBING] -Okay. Okay, okay. [SHUSHING] CAROLYN: Stop. -I can't do this. -Okay, okay, okay, okay. She's in a warfare now. Rachel and Danny Tucker, and she... she raised Evan and Chris like her own brothers. She looked up to Danny like a father. -This doesn't make any sense. -[PHONE BEEPS] DANNY: [ON RECORDING] Hey, Tony. It's Danny. Um... Listen, I... I just fired Logan and, uh, he got real pissed. He said he was gonna kill me. [DANNY BREATHING SHAKILY] Look, I'm... I'm driving home now and I... I think he might be following me. So, uh... I don't know. I... I think this guy could be dangerous. And I... I just thought you should know. Um... Yeah, I don't know what to do. Call me back, okay? -[LINE DISCONNECTS] -[BELLS TOLLING] This doesn't make any sense. Have you arrested Logan Vonda yet? On November 17th, last Tuesday, at approximately 7:30, Daniel Turner left his home to go to Steve's Sporting Goods Store on Belleau for the purpose of firing Logan Vonda, an employee who had been caught stealing. Previously that day, Danny had requested that Mary Ann pick up Evan and Christopher and bring them back to her apartment for the evening. Danny told her that Rachel would be working late, and he wanted her to get a good night's rest because she would be starting a new job following day. Mary Ann arrived later than planned, approximately 7:00. Rachel arrived home at 7:15. Mary Ann said that she didn't notice anything strange or different about Danny or Rachel. After Danny left, Rachel and Mary Ann decided that the boys would not be going to Mary Ann's apartment that night. You're saying that Danny thought the boys were gonna be with Mary Ann when he went to go fire Logan? I... I should've known that something was up. If I had only insisted that the boys stay with me. -At least Evan I could've stopped. -No, no, no... [CRYING HYSTERICALLY] CAROLYN: No, you couldn't have done anything. [SHUSHING] Have... Have you interviewed Vonda? According to his statement, the store closed 7:45, and that's when Danny arrived and accused him of stealing from the cash register. Logan Vonda begged Danny not to fire him and Danny said something like, "Okay, there might be another way," and said he should follow him to R.J. Vale Elementary. Once they got there, Logan said that he asked Danny to tell him about the idea he had back at the store, thinking that Danny wanted him to obtain drugs for him. Danny didn't do drugs. BEN: When he suggested he could take care of Danny, if that's what he wanted, he said Danny started laughing and says something along all the lines of "It's gonna to take much more than that." So it's possible that Logan Vonda helped Danny kill Rachel and Evan. But you said he committed suicide. Are you sure? I mean, how do we know he's telling the truth? Vonda could've committed the murders and then... and then staged Danny's death. Oh, that... that makes more sense. Yeah, I mean, you already have Logan admitting to plotting a crime with Danny. He gets off scot-free, and Danny's not here to speak for himself. Look, I know this is very hard for you to take, but I can speak with certainty that Danny committed these killings, and then he took his own life. [BREATHING HEAVILY] [SIGHING] [SNIFFLING] MITCH: "The trust of the innocent is a liar's most useful tool." Stephen King. Danny liked Stephen King. This is feeling like a Stephen King novel to me. Some of you may be aware that Danny did a stretch in prison along with Tony here. Prison? What's he talking about? We broke into a house and got caught, Bill. Danny attacked a guy. He... He beat him with a tire iron. BEN: Had it not been for Tony stopping him, it is almost certain he would have killed the man. We've all made mistakes, Bill. That was over 20 years ago, and I can attest that Tony having gone through that as a kid has made him the good man that he is today. Danny... Well, cussing and drinking doesn't make you a murderer. BILL: Uh... I believe that, Mitch, I do. But it's just... Danny doesn't... Danny didn't have a temper. Hell, I always knew you two as just high school football heroes. [ROCK MUSIC PLAYING] [GIRLS LAUGHING] [CROWD CHEERING] ANNOUNCER : [OVER PA] ...with 45 seconds left on the clock, Tony Turner behind center needs to convert here to keep the drive alive. Turner calls an audible. That's the snap. Turner well into his left. Here comes the Blitz. He's got a man open down the line. Turner gets his brother Danny at dead center! He's in the 15, the 10, the five, touchdown! [CROWD CHEERING] The Cougars win the game. The Cougars win the game. Unbelievable! The Turner brothers do it again. He's got them to a final score of... [TRUMPET PLAYING NOTES] Danny? Hey, you okay? Yeah, hey... -YOUNG TONY: Danny, let's go. -Yeah. Am I gonna see you at the party later? Sure. Um, I want you to meet someone. Danny Turner, this is Rachel McKenna. Danny scored the winning touchdown today. Wow. Cool. -YOUNG TONY: Come on, man, let's go! -Nice to meet you, Danny. -Nice meeting you, too. -[HORNS HONKING] -What did you say your name was, Renee? -No, it's Rach... It's Rachel. YOUNG TONY: We're late for the kegger, man. TONY: When the scholarships didn't come in, things eventually kind of fell apart. That summer, Danny and I picked up stock boy jobs at Tager's Lumber Yard to make some extra money. But it was never enough. What do we got here? So we started stealing inventory and fencing it to pick up the extra bucks. I knew a guy in Baton Rouge that would pay 25 bucks per saw. We could make $500. You have to understand, we were making minimum wage at the time. Things continued like that for about a year. Then we got a phone call from Bags. What's up, man? [POOL BALLS CLINKING] Nice. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] YOUNG TONY: Yo, Bags. Over here. BAGS: Ah! There they are. -[LAUGHS] Yo, what's going on? -What's up? Hey, Danny! Come here, bud. BAGS: How we doing, fellas? YOUNG TONY: Good, good. BAGS: Good. YOUNG TONY: What do you got for us? I got something for you. You know that antique shop over at Novelty? The one that sells all that crap like old clocks and paintings and tables and stuff? Well, I had to do deliveries there every day, and I started getting friendly with the big bald dude Jack who hauls all the stuff around for the two old farts that own the joint. He said that they do a lot, [SNICKERING] and I mean, a lot of business in cash, then they take it home to their house in Lafayette. Cash! Say that's true, how are we supposed to get the cash out of the safe if we don't know the combination. Jack knows the combination. Like, he won't do the break-in, but he'll give it to us if we cut him in. Check this. He says that they're planning to go to Florida for a few months in January. If we give him a 1,000 bucks upfront, he'll make us a copy of the house key and give us the code to the alarm system. Merry Christmas, boys. [ALL CHUCKLING] -[BANGING ON TABLE] -Come on! Huh? Ho-ho-ho. [LAUGHS] TONY: Jack said the safe was bolted inside a cabinet upstairs. There was at least $50,000 in it. Jack also said the homeowners, Don and Linda Grant, they closed up shop week after Christmas every year. Just put the lights on timers and bolted out of town. So we hung out for a few days just to make sure the place was empty. We were so excited because we had the keys. We weren't exactly pros and we should've realized at the time that the... YOUNG DANNY: Okay, go ahead. ...the whole plan rested on a stranger whose last name we didn't even know. [ROCK MUSIC PLAYING ON CAR STEREO] BAGS: Yo, Danny, turn it up. [MUSIC GETS LOUDER] [ELECTRIC GUITAR SOLO PLAYING] TONY: Kevin and Missy Grant were driving in from Chicago that day. They were gonna stay at the house for a few days before heading down to Florida to meet up with Kevin's parents. [ALARM SYSTEM BEEPS] MISSY: Thank you. TONY: Kevin's parents didn't know at the time that Missy was three months pregnant. And we didn't know that they were gonna to be there. [BAGS HUMMING] BAGS: Hey, how did you guys get here before me? A tire iron? The place is empty, Danny. What's the difference? TONY: We should have seen that there was something wrong with Danny, something in his head. I'll leave it in the gym bag just in case. Forget it. Come on. YOUNG TONY: [WHISPERING] What are you're doing? Turn... Turn them off. Turn them off. Turn them off. [KEYPAD BEEPING] [ALARM BEEPS] -[UNLOCKING DOOR] -[ALARM BEEPS] [ALARM BEEPS] TONY: That lamp bothered me. The lamp was off when I knew that those lights were supposed to be on a timer. [SHUSHING] Something's wrong. BAGS: [CHUCKLES] Chill, Tony. No one's here but us chickens. Let's go. -[FAINT LAUGHTER] -[THUDDING] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Do you hear something? [MISSY MOANS] TONY: I remember how young and frightened we all were. Danny in particular, his... his big old eyes just talking out of his head. BAGS: Hey, give me a hand. BAGS: [WHISPERING] Here, take this. Hold this up. [CHUCKLES] Oh, boy... [LAUGHING] BAGS: What did I tell you? What did I tell you? There! Go on! Tony! Check! YOUNG TONY: All right. Load it up. -[LOUD THUD] -[BOTH GASP] [WHISPERING] There's someone in the house. [BAGS SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] We have to call the cops. I left my phone downstairs. [THUDDING] Kevin, be careful. [BREATH TREMBLING] [BAGS SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] What the hell are you doing? Don't do anything stupid and no one's gonna get hurt. Kevin? Missy, go downstairs, call the cops. Now! [PANTING] YOUNG TONY: No, come back. [GRUNTS] TONY: So, Bill, when you say that It's hard to believe that Danny had a temper, I say that you did not know Danny the way I did. [KEVIN GROANS] Bastard! [GRUNTING] -Don't... ever... hit... me. -Get off, Danny! No, Danny! BAGS: Come on, chill out! We gotta go! I'm outta here. Go! [PANTING] Where is it? Where is it? [PHONE BEEPS] [MISSY SCREAMING] Call the cops and I'll kill you. Aah! [GRUNTS] [MISSY GROANS] [SOBBING] [MISSY GROANING IN PAIN] Bags took the cash. He bolted. We went after him. He was tearing down Highway 10 in Henderson and... [SIGHS] He collided with a tree on the side of the road. And half of him went through the windshield. Danny and I got back to our house and the cops were already there. They're waiting for us because it turns out that Missy went to Henderson High School. [CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS] She recognized us from our star high school football days. So go figure that. Kevin Grant suffered a brain injury, broken ribs, punctured lung. He was recovering in that hospital for a month. If Danny beat him any more, he never would've made it. [DOCTORS SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] TONY: Because of the violent nature of our crime and the fact that we were high school football heroes, our case was front page news for a few days. We were advised to take a deal, so we did. We agreed to 10 to 25. [JAIL CELL BUZZER SOUNDS] [CELL GATE CLOSING] [INMATES TALKING INDISTINCTLY] TONY: We were thrown in St. Charles Parish Correctional Facility. Danny was put in a cell on the opposite side of the prison from me and the only contact we had was the writing of a letter, or an occasional phone call. [DOOR BUZZING] GUARD: All right, let's go. TONY: I realized during my time there that that was an opportunity for me to change direction in my life, to make something of myself. And at that moment, I felt this overwhelming sense of gratitude for my whole situation. I accepted the fact that it was a good thing that we got caught. I felt sorry for Danny. I felt responsible for him. There was nothing I could do. I wrote him letters and I tried to get him to admit that what he did was wrong, that he was damn lucky that he did not kill Kevin Grant that night. That he had a chance to do the right thing from that moment forward. He didn't listen to me. He said that he was just gonna play nice, he was gonna work the system because that afforded him certain privileges that made life on the inside a lot easier. But he just wanted out... and to stay out. You two knew them best. Yeah, Carolyn, you and Rachel were like sisters. I've heard the stories. And, Mitch, when you say Tony became a better man due to his past, I believe it. I do, Tony. So Danny's hiding this darkness inside, I get it, but... Don't we all? I mean, it doesn't... doesn't mean we're all capable of murdering our families. BEN: I suppose. But a crime scene tells a story, much like Tony's. And it's up to my guys to read it correctly. TONY: Carolyn, your father, Joe, his regular visits, they made all the difference in the world. They really did. Imagine your high school coach visiting you in jail... just to remind you that... the outside world still cared about you. And he reminded us not to give up hope and to stay strong because a miracle could come at any time. And it did. In the form of a letter from Kevin Grant. He wrote in his letter that he had come to the conclusion that in order to be free, he needed to forgive. So he wanted to meet Danny and me in prison so he could forgive us in person. KEVIN: Yet forgiveness is an easier thing to talk about... [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] How are you? -Orange. Nice. -[BOTH CHUCKLE] TONY: Imagine that. The guy that you had beat the crap out of is asking for permission to forgive you. [VOICE SHAKING] The honesty in his letter was undeniable. Um... We never properly met. I was in the hospital during your trial. Yeah, last time we were in the same room was on that night. I like the mustache. I'm so used to seeing you from the news clippings of the case. It makes you look older. I feel older. [EXHALES] Um... After that night... I spent the next few years driven crazy with anger. I'd lie in bed at night just... just wishing I'd picked up that bat, and smashed you both over the heads. Why did I not defend my wife? Listen, Kevin, -I mean, we're sorry. We just... -I know you are. Because you got caught. But it... it could have easily have gone the other way. I could have been killed and Missy, too. It could have been much worse. And it took me a long time to see that. But, uh... after I recovered, I, uh... I went back to work. We had our... our son... and I thought life would get back to normal. But instead... instead I... I... I sank into a deep depression. Uh... One night... [DOOR CLICKS SHUT] I was closing up the shop around 8:00. And I see this guy Harold, who often slept on the grate across the street. And he was talking with this well-dressed, soft-spoken woman. And, I, uh... I go to walk past and he calls out. He says, "Hey, Kevin..." -Hey, Kevin. -"...slow down, man." -Come on. -"This is Joanna." -Come on. -"She... She's here for you." [ECHOING] Hi, Kevin. And, uh... [SIGHS WEARILY] That night, I had brought with me a bottle of pills, and I was going to sit in my car and die. I couldn't see the wonderful things I had to live for, like Missy, and my son and my parents and my friends. I was... I was so full of hate for you, for myself, for... for... for not being a man that night that I... I couldn't see what my death would do to those who loved me. I... I couldn't see how much I had to live for. And all of a sudden, Joanna took my hand and she stared intensely into my eyes, like she could look into my mind. JOANNA: I came to tell you something, Kevin. Let go of your anger. Go home tonight and pray for the men that hurt you and mean it. Pray that those men you hate will be happy. And one day free. Pray for God to allow you to forgive them because that is the only way you will ever be free. One more thing, Kevin. Your plan for tonight is a very bad idea. KEVIN: I went back to my car and I looked at the bottle of pills. But instead of taking them... I prayed. I out... I prayed out loud like she told me to. I prayed for you both to have a good life. I prayed to be able to forgive you. I prayed to be able to forgive myself. And the most amazing thing happened. I felt free. [SIGHS SOFTLY] Thank you. TONY: Danny said that he had these visions of a woman with gray hair and olive-colored skin. He said she was so real that when he closed his eyes, she was standing right there in the cell in front of him. We had a hearing for early release. The committee overseeing our cases read letters of support... from Linda, and Missy and Kevin Grant. And the decision to release us earlier was unanimous. [JAIL CELL BUZZER SOUNDS] [INDISTINCT CONVERSATION AND LAUGHTER] [PEOPLE SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] -Come on. Come on. -What you got? What you got? Run faster! Get in there! Back up, back up! ALL: Yeah! MAN: That's my boy. That's my boy. That's my boy. See you boys next week. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [SIGHS] TONY: All right. I got a date with Emily tonight. What are you guys up to? Good for you. Maybe she can kiss your basketball boo-boos. [CHUCKLES] That's funny. -Good night, guys. -See you, buddy. Hey, speaking of dates... -I got someone I want you to meet. -Oh, come on, man. -Come on. Come for a quick drink. -Come on. You'd like that... the band. It's Steve Manano's band. You like them, right? -MITCH: Yeah. -Quick one. -Okay. -You'll like her, too, don't worry. -Oh, Jesus. -[DANNY CHUCKLES] [ROCK MUSIC PLAYING] Hey, Mike. What up? -MITCH: What was her name again? -Her name's, uh, Carolyn. She went to Henderson High. Think you might know her. Hey! Whoo! Oh, shit. Look who's here. Jimmy! Don't you drink too much. I don't wanna have to carry you home. Come on, now. Hear that. Hear that in your bones? You gotta feel that music in your bones. Come on, man. -CAROLYN: Danny! -That's my girl! Hey. Hey, listen! There's someone I want to reintroduce you to. What do you mean, reintroduce? Yeah. Reintroduce you because, a long time ago after a game, I wanted to introduce you to my friend Rachel but you'd taken off to a keg party or something. -Yeah, yeah. That sounds like me back then. I'm sorry. -Yeah. -Hey, this is my buddy Mitch, the one I was telling you about. -Hi! -Mitch, this is Carolyn. -Nice to meet you. -What? -Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, too. [LAUGHS] Mitch is a great guy. He's an okay basketball player, but he's the best architect you'll ever meet. -Oh! -He designed one of our shops. Yeah, he was... he graduated a couple of years ahead of us at Henderson. -Oh, okay. -Oh, you gotta remember this face. Look at this guy. Tall, dark and handsome. CAROLYN: Sorry. [CHUCKLES] -It was nice to meet you. -Likewise. Yeah. It's okay. His tongue swells up when he gets hit by the love bug. -Oh. -Oh, man. [CHUCKLES] Oh, my God, there's my friend Rachel. Okay, come with me. Hey, do me a favor... Rachel! -Do not call her Renee again. -Okay. Okay. RACHEL: Hi! -I'm Danny. -I'm Rachel. -Right. I remember. -Yeah. DANNY: I'm sorry, yeah. RACHEL: Hey, I love this song. You wanna dance? Do you, um, I don't know, wanna have a drink? -Why not? -Okay. DANNY: What do you like for breakfast in the morning? That's a really bad question to ask. -That sounds really terrible. Forget it. -[LAUGHS] -Are you inviting me to breakfast? -Yeah, that's why it sounds bad. I wasn't asking you that kind of... Forget I asked you that. Just dance with me. Come on. [MUSIC PLAYING] Club soda, please. CAROLYN: How's your drink? Strong enough for you? ♪ You seein' my baby walking ♪ Tell her I caught my train And gone ♪ If you see my baby walkin' [ALARM RINGING] [ALARM STOPS] [TV BEEPS] I'm standing at the edge of Nicholson Quarry in St. Francisville where the final act of the Turner family tragedy took place Tuesday morning. It was here that Danny Turner, husband and father of the victims, took his own life. Though the final report has not yet been released by the medical examiner... [TV BEEPS OFF] RACHEL: [VOICEMAIL RECORDING] Hey, sweetie, it's Rachel. What are you up to? I'm about to go take my exam, and I just was calling... [BIRDS CHIRPING] Ben. Thank you for agreeing to meet with me. Glad you reached out. BEN: Look, I didn't want to get into all these details in front of the family. But, uh... This is kinda what happened. Danny told Logan that he wanted him to help fake a jewelry heist at his house to make an insurance claim of $30,000, which he said he would share with Logan. Logan said he didn't think it was really a crime. So they left Logan's car at R.J. Vale Elementary school and then drove to Danny's house together. Now here's where it gets interesting. Around 11:30 p.m., Danny came back and told Logan that Rachel was asleep and to break the glass in the back door of the garage to make it look like a break-in. [WHISPERS] And I want you to put a brick through the window, okay? You do that for me. Make it look like we, you know... just like somebody robbed the house, got it? -All right. -You got a phone on you. BEN: Now according to phone records, Danny then made several calls in the next few hours, including one to his brother and several to Logan's friends in which he claimed that he had just fired Logan and Logan had threatened to kill him. [CLEARS THROAT] Hey, Tony. It's Danny. Um... Listen, I... I just fired Logan. Doesn't this Logan guy also have a record? I mean, why do the police believe what he has to say? Okay, so, Logan has a record, but his statements check out. Look, when you're dealing with a crime like this, it's very common for witnesses to be people with dicey backgrounds. We know Logan isn't a Boy Scout. The fact that Danny made these calls suggests that he was trying to frame Logan and create an alibi for himself. You think it was premeditated? BEN: Around 1:00 a.m., he came back and said that he never really planned to steal any jewelry. In fact, there wasn't any jewelry to steal. -Instead, he wanted Logan's help killing Rachel. -There's a change of plan. I, uh... I need to... I need to kill my wife. Okay? So I need you to do it 'cause I can't fucking do it. [CHUCKLES] What the hell are you talking about, man? Nobody would hang around after somebody tells 'em they want help killing their wife. This Logan kid's lying. Logan said he stayed on because Danny said something like, "Did you think I was serious, dude?" -[LAUGHS] -I'll split the fucking insurance money with you, okay? That was if I break a window. -Look, man... -I can't kill nobody. Come on, bro. Come on. You can fucking do it. You're fucking with me, right? -[BOTH LAUGHING] -You're fucking with me right now. Yeah. [LAUGHS] I'm fucking with you. Shh! Calm the fuck down, dude. Logan says he was convinced Danny wasn't serious about killing Rachel. He was jumpy and wild-eyed and he refused to give Logan his cell phone back, and then abruptly went back into the house. That's when Logan got spooked. He got a screwdriver and held on to it in the car. And he says he fell asleep. -Asleep? -Yeah. Come on, man. You're so convinced he had nothing to do it, you're not making sense. Sometime after midnight, Danny went upstairs with intent to bludgeon Rachel to death. Rachel was asleep at that time. You may recall a brownish lamp in the living room with a very heavy base? Well, Danny got a kitchen knife, cut the cord and used that lamp as the primary weapon. MITCH: And Rachel knew this was happening? Yeah. We think so. Danny probably thought that one blow to her head would have been sufficient to kill her, like on TV. Well, it didn't. -In fact, she fought back. -[DANNY SCREAMS] Danny then used the kitchen knife to stab her. [RACHEL CRIES] But the kitchen knife was only two inches long. So at some point, Danny grabbed a pair of scissors from the sewing table, and stabbed her with those. [RACHEL SCREAMS] Did she know it was Danny? Well, the struggle went on for several minutes, and even though we suppose the room was dark, she must have recognized his voice. And apparently, there was a great deal of shouting between them. That's probably what woke the children. Rachel had, um, marks on her arms and what we presume to be Danny's skin under her fingernails. I mean... She was fighting for her life, Mitch. There's no doubt she recognized the attacker. My notes say that she suffered from a severed left carotid artery which resulted in exsanguination... bleeding to death. That would likely be the official cause of death when the report is completed. Mitch, I've been doing this for 20 years. I've never... [SIGHS] I've never seen anything like this. Lamp, knife, scissors. [RACHEL'S VOICEMAIL PLAYING INDISTINCTLY] Hey, sweetie, it's Rachel. I'm calling you because I have an exam and I just wanted to get one of your famous pep talks. Also, it's raining really nasty right here, and I wondered if it's raining there, too... Carolyn. ...talk to you soon. Love you, girl. Were you listening to Rachel's message again? [SIGHS] Actually, you know, I don't... I don't... [SIGHS] I don't really listen to it. Actually, that's not true. -Yeah, it is. -No. It bothers me that you can't be honest with me right now... So I listen to it sometimes. I don't understand why it's a bad thing. It's comforting to me to hear Rachel's voice. You don't understand how much I need a comforting voice right now. -I don't understand, huh? -No, you don't. I've been dealing with this right alongside you the whole time. Okay? And it... it frustrates me that I can't figure out how to move on. -[MOANS] -Move past it! It's killing me! Well, I don't listen to it over and over again, if that's your concern. -You're lying to me. -I'm lying? You wanna talk about lying? How about you and your secret investigations? Your late night phone calls, coming home after the boys have gone to bed, sneaking in and then checking up on me. You don't understand what I'm going through. You don't care! You don't care. You care only about yourself, so leave me alone about this. Why are you guys so mad? Oh, no... Sweetheart. Honey... [MITCH SIGHS] We're not, baby. We're... Say good night to daddy. Good night, buddy. -Good night. -Come on. I'm sorry we woke you up, sweetheart. We'll get you a pillow. Get all cuddled in. Hey, sweetie. It's Rachel. What are you up to? Uh, I am about to go take my exam and I was just calling to get one of your famous pep talks. Also, it's raining here and I was just wondering if it's raining there, too... -[FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] -[BEEPS] [MITCH SIGHS] Well, it's straight from the heart. I know people will remember Rachel as the generous and honest person that she was. It's... It's truthful, as it should be. I just don't feel like this is real. Hope I can do it. Look... people will understand that this is very hard thing to do. You just have to have faith that... -[ORGAN PLAYING] -[CHURCH BELLS TOLLING] [PEOPLE SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] We're here to celebrate the lives of Rachel Turner and her son Evan, two beautiful souls who were taken from us far too soon, but delivered into the hands of the Lord. The will of God will never take you where the grace of God will not protect you. Now I'd like to call on Carolyn Bianci if she would come to the lectern and share some words. [SOBS] My name is Carolyn Bianci [SNIFFLES] and I am privileged to say that Rachel had been my best friend since ninth grade. We formed an immediate connection and... and developed a bond that continued for the past 26 years. I knew that in Rachel I had a friend for life. We shared a lot of our lives together because she was so willing to... to invest her time and her heart into her friends. And I love her and I miss her dearly. [SNIFFLES] As you all know, Rachel... Um, Rachel was never the type to settle. She always demanded more of herself and always wanted the best for her family and for her friends. So in addition to raising two wonderful boys, Evan and Christopher, whom she was so proud of, she opened her home with no hesitation to Mary Ann because of her love of family and her enormous heart for others. They say if you can find one true friend in your life, you are blessed, and we are all so blessed because, in Rachel, we had that one true friend. [SNIFFLES] My husband Mitch... is constantly reminding our three sons that our decisions shape our lives, and ultimately, shape the individuals that we become. We all have one question before us today and that question is what meaning will we attach to these events. If we choose tragedy, then we will all lose. So the challenge that I want to put there for all of us, including myself is, is to take that piece of Rachel that we were all so fortunate to experience and hold that in their hearts forever... by... allowing it to inspire us as mothers and fathers and friends. We will take Rachel and Evan's light forward. Thank you, Carolyn. REVEREND: I would regret this day forever if I do not summon the courage to speak of another. We've spoken of Rachel and Evan. But we have not made mention of Danny Turner, husband and father. I'd be remiss if I did not at least mention that he, too, is a child of God. And he, too, has passed into another life, prematurely. And he will be missed. [ROARS] Got you. MITCH: He said it was a combination of multiple stab wounds, a severed carotid artery, numerous blunt-force traumas, and a broken jaw. But the severed artery alone probably caused her death. Why did he kill Evan? Why did he do that? Well, Ben said, based on physical evidence and comments from Christopher... it appears Evan attempted to... to stop Danny from attacking Rachel and Danny lashed out, possibly thinking Logan Vonda was behind him. I don't know what to think. Why didn't he hurt Christopher? Bill said Christopher had blood on his back, I'm guessing from Danny pushing Christopher into his room. Well, maybe Danny ran out of adrenaline, came to his senses and was able to stop at that point. Or someone intervened. -[WAVES CRASHING] -[BELLS CHIMING] WOMAN: [SOFTLY] Joanna. Joanna. Come back here. You are so sweet. You know he's going to understand. But we have to let him sleep. It's his birthday. I'm gonna surprise him anyway. Okay. Go on outside, okay? Okay. [DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES] [YOUNG JOANNA HUMMING] [WIND BLOWING] [WIND CHIMES CHIMING] Ha! [GASPS] [ECHOING] Daddy? Daddy! Daddy! [WATER DRIPPING] Jo, shh. What has gotten into you? Mom, I know something's wrong. I saw this big blue balloon come out the window and go into the sky. JOANNA'S MOTHER: What happened? What do you mean, a big blue balloon? I saw this big blue balloon and it flew away and took Daddy with it. [SIGHS] Daddy is okay. Why don't you set the table and I'll go wake him up? Okay? All right. Please, God. Please, God. Please, God. Please. JOANNA'S MOTHER: [SCREAMING] Honey! Oh, God, no. He's gone! [PHONE RINGING] This is Mitch Bianci. BEN: Listen, I thought about it after our talk and... I know where Vonda is. Where? Well, you were right. His actions are not of a man who just happened to be at the wrong place at the wrong time. But you need to understand something. He did not do this. Where is he? Promise me you won't hurt him, Mitch. Look, I know how important this is to you, and that's why I didn't tell you at the diner, okay? So just promise me. I think you need to hear it from him. I think it's the only way. [SOFTLY] Please, please, please. Please, God, please. Oh, my God, please. [SOBBING] I can't take this anymore, I can't take this anymore, I can't take this anymore. I want it to stop. [PRAYING INDISTINCTLY] [PRAYING INDISTINCTLY] I'm begging you, I beg you. At least a million times a day, I beg you, please... Please just make it stop. Why? Why, why? Why does this world seem so miserable? So... and... and... [CRYING] fruitless, and hopeless, and random? [LOUDER] I don't understand. Help me understand, I wanna know why. I wanna know why. [CAROLYN CONTINUES SOBBING] CAROLYN: Please. Help me stop thinking about this, please. Please, God. Help me. [RAINDROPS PATTERING] [THUNDER RUMBLING] [KNOCKING AT DOOR] MITCH: I'm looking for Logan Vonda. Does he live here? My name is Mitch Bianci. I was a friend of Danny Turner's. I know who you are. How'd you find me? I've got nothing to say to you. All right? Leave me alone. I just want to talk to you. Get a better idea of what Danny did that night. I know you weren't to blame. I said all I'm going to say. Already said everything to the cops. MITCH: Can you just come out for a sec? I'm not looking for trouble. I'll pay you for information. How much? LOGAN: So, what do you want to know? Why did Danny ask you to come to the house that night? I want to hear it from you because this whole thing is... [INHALES AND EXHALES DEEPLY] And Danny was my friend, and I need to know. You want to know why. I don't know. All I know is what he told me. I don't know, it was just some... some made-up stuff. He was trying to make it look like I did it. He was going to use that shotgun on me. After he killed Rachel. Make it look like self-defense. And to save his wife, he'd have to kill me. Did you go into the house? After Danny said he was going to kill her, why would I set foot in that house? [THUNDER RUMBLING] I'd just been out front, making it look like a... a break-in. I ain't stupid. How did you sleep with all the yelling and screaming? And where did Danny get a shotgun? You wanna know the truth? That's all I want. I was... I was holding on to a couple of Oxys. I was saving 'em for when I got home. After he went in the house that last time, I... I popped 'em. Just nodded out. [EXHALES] Just one last question. When Danny told you he was gonna kill Rachel, why didn't you do anything? I don't know, go to the neighbors, call the cops. You could have saved their lives. You really think I don't wish I did things different? I live with this every day. Knowin' that if... if I'd... helped, I'd done something, anything... Rachel, Evan, they... they could still be alive. I know that. I... I don't want your money. Joanna Larson. So happy to meet you. Rachel asked that I come. [CRYING] She... I'm Carolyn. I know. I... I'm sorry, do I know you? We've never personally met until now, but I've been thinking about you a great deal these few days. -Why am I here? -Yes. And why have I been thinking about you given we don't know each other? A perfectly reasonable question to ask someone who just showed up at your house. May I come in? Yes. -Yeah? -Yes. Have you figured it out yet? I was sent here to help you. [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] I wasn't really gonna take them, but the doctor said they would make me feel better. Uh... You said Rachel asked you to come. What did you mean? JOANNA: Life changes in an instant, the ordinary instant. Joan Didion. Yes, exactly. "To choose between darkness and light." "And that we always have free will." JOANNA: And when a tiny nub of truth makes a lie seem real, it blurs our choices like there are two voices inside your head. Tell me something. When you're upstairs, in that sacred spot, praying on your knees, you believe that God hears you, don't you? I want to. I want to so badly. But every day, I wake up... and I just feel the same pain and grief and hurt, and... and, you know, I just... I have these horrible... thoughts. Who... How'd you... How do you know where I... Because it was shown to me. That morning, Carolyn, I awoke with the natural to a particularly angry dawn. CAROLYN: The natural? Are... are you saying you see things when they happen? You saw these murders happen? Not so like I'm seeing you. This is something different. More like how Mitch saw Rachel a few days before the funeral. How could you possibly know that? Oh, it all started the day I saw my father pass away. [WIND CHIME CHIMING] [JOANNA CHUCKLES] Since that morning, I found that I could look at someone and know if he's at risk, because darkness had him in its grip. [CAR HORN BLARING] [TIRES SQUEAL] JOANNA: Sometimes, I was able to help. Other times...[CHUCKLES] free will takes over, and then a person may make the very worst decision. As did Danny. Ironically enough, I had two occasions to help Danny. It only takes one bad decision. CAROLYN: Does the darkness ever let go? JOANNA: Maybe, Carolyn. But Danny is in heaven. Oh, gosh. Things have a way of... well, changing as the universe directs. It's a spiritual contract. And it's out of our control. Sometimes, I think of it... more as a responsibility that I've been given. But I believe... No. I know that I have been selected to help where I can. Oh, oh, oh, I have so much to tell you. But it's important that your husband be a part of the conversation. JOANNA: Oh... He's been suffering so much, I'm worried about him. CAROLYN: I don't know where he is. We've been fighting. I woke up this morning and he was gone. -I would call the office... -He's on his way home to you... right now. Time for me to go. This is my address. Visit me tomorrow with your husband and feel better. Help is on the way. [DOOR OPENING] [DOOR CLOSING] -[CAR DOOR CLOSING] -[ENGINE STARTING] [CELL PHONE RINGING] -CAROLYN: Mitch? -Hey, listen. I found... I just met the most amazing woman. She... She said that Rachel sent her here to help us. MITCH: I found Logan Vonda. You what? Before you say anything, I... I... I'm glad I did. Because now I... I... I understand why Danny did what he did, but... but... Not why he did what he did, but how it happened. She said Danny is in heaven. MITCH: No, no, no. Uh... Danny made his choice. She said that you would say that. She... She told me to tell you... the butterfly thinks you have beautiful eyes. MITCH: There's something I'd like to do before we go visit Joanna. I'd like to stop by Nicholson Quarry. Why would you wanna do that? it seems appropriate. BEN: I was chatting with the owners of the quarry. I think we ought to put a metal fence between those two trees back there. They're afraid it might become one of those places where people come and... -You know? -Golden Gate Bridge. Yeah. I didn't expect to find you here. I come here whatever I can... looking for something. Maybe the same reason you're here now. Listen, what if I told you that we uncovered evidence of financial trouble in the Turner household? Maybe even some marital problems. Would that make a difference? No. Not anymore. Okay. I'm gonna go now. Let me know if you find what you're looking for. [ENGINE STARTS] [ENGINE STARTS] I have felt Rachel's presence so many times since she died. But I... I just... I convinced myself that I was imagining things. And then yesterday when I met Joanna, she told me that... that... That Rachel's soul lives on, and sometimes our souls, they... they intersect. Joanna was in the church. She sat in the very last pew. She told me Rachel was proud of me for speaking on her behalf. She was standing next to me at the altar and I felt it. I felt it. I... I felt it. MITCH: Yeah, I felt it, too. Hi, I'm Richard. You must be Carolyn and Mitch. I've been expecting you. MITCH: Like when Rachel was standing in the doorway laughing and smiling. CAROLYN: Yeah, she was there. She was there. When Joanna and I were talking, she was there. Sanctuary night. Beautiful, isn't it? RICHARD: Hmm. If God cares about the grieving, why wouldn't he prevent it? RICHARD: I don't know how she does it, but anything she touches just seems to grow and grow. [CHUCKLES] Joanna says it's because of all the conversations she's had with the trees over the years. Ah. There she is. -I'll see you later. -CAROLYN: Thank you. -JOANNA: Mm. -[CAROLYN CHUCKLES] Is that why we're here, Mitch? Why you refuse to believe that he's in a better place? I don't know if I can ever forgive him. I don't know, but I have to believe that he's in heaven. I... I have to believe that. No. Mitch... Why would a murderer like Danny be allowed into heaven? [INHALES DEEPLY] [SIGHS] You know, I never once saw Danny in a bad mood. Always had a smile on his face, and I've known him a long time. Heck, he introduced us. I've never even seen him lose his temper, not once. You know, I mean, he didn't... He didn't do everything right. He... didn't work very hard, didn't manage his finances very well, but if you knew him like I did, you would say that he led a happy and productive life. And then to murder your wife and your kid... and then to kill yourself... it makes no sense. So I just... I... I need to understand. You understand more than you realize, Mitch. Danny's easygoing nature was a mask and was the result of his fears. A fear of not being good enough. A fear of failure. A fear of not being loved. [MITCH INHALES DEEPLY AND SIGHS] JOANNA: That's what drove him to always be nice, so that he would always be liked. But Danny had anger in him, a darkness. Ah. JOANNA: The fact that he wore a mask to disguise it didn't make it any less real. In fact, it made it all the more explosive when it finally came out. You love them too much. Yeah, sure. That don't mean that sometimes I don't feel like pointing it all west and just driving to some town where no one can find me. JOANNA: Because he thought of himself as unworthy. So he tried to compensate by lying, and cheating, pretending he was something he wasn't. He fought with the darkness, and lost again and again because he stopped trusting in God. Without trust... there is no faith. Yes, we do have free will. Yes, we do make mistakes. Yes, we all experience darkness. Two angels appeared at Danny's bedside the night before and said, "Do not do what you are about to do." Those angels attempted to convert Danny's thinking, to show him there was another way. But the lure of darkness was impossible for Danny to resist. He was given the opportunity to choose darkness and light. In his confusion, it was the darkness that appeared to be the truth. I said, "We always have free will, Danny." That's what I tried to remind him of. But I knew he wouldn't listen. [THUNDER RUMBLING] [DANNY WHIMPERING] [THUNDER RUMBLING] [DANNY SCREAMING] [GRUNTING] JOANNA: I seized the opportunity to push him towards the light. [STRAINING] VOICE: [WHISPERING] Cut the cord. Cut the cord. JOANNA: For a moment I thought we had won. Then the darkness overtook him. It pushed him towards the lamp and shouted... VOICE: It's too late to turn back. Don't you stop now. Don't you stop, Danny. Don't stop. JOANNA: The instant he sliced that cord, and picked up the lamp, he was prodded up the stairs. VOICE: It's too late to turn back. It's too late to turn back. [THUNDERCLAP] [VOICES SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] God, don't let this happen! [VOICES SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] God, don't let this happen! Now the darkness gave him one last nudge. It works a million times a day all over the world. A tiny nub of truth that... that makes a lie seem real. [THUNDER RUMBLING] [JINGLING] [STIRRING] [RACHEL STIRRING] RACHEL: Danny? What? [GROANS IN PAIN] [MUFFLED SCREAMING] [SCREAMING CONTINUES] [SCREAMING] EVAN: What are you doing? JOANNA: After Rachel, he lashed out at Evan. He was told he was doing the best thing for his son, so he believed it. [EVAN SCREAMING] I begged God to stop him. Stop it now! And fell to my knees. And perhaps I was heard. [DANNY WHIMPERING] I will never know. [CRYING] Hey... Hey... put some shoes on, buddy. Can't run around the house with no shoes on, come on. Put some shoes on. Hey, it's okay. It's okay. Shh. It's okay. It's okay. Go back to bed. JOANNA: He was on his way to kill Christopher, when finally an angel blocked Christopher's doorway and told Danny, "Stop. "You are not taking this one." Those words brought Danny to his senses, and saved Christopher. I want you to consider something. Perhaps it will help you to understand the power of forgiveness. [CRYING] Please forgive me. JOANNA: You can remain angry at Danny. You can hate him. You can hope that he rots in hell, punished for the rest of eternity. That's your choice. But then you stay trapped in your anger, and in prison in your own emotions, because of a desire to see another suffer. Ask yourself something. Do you want to be guided by hate... or by love? Danny, like all of us, he was a sinner as we are, but his father loved him nonetheless and brought him back home. God does not view sin in different levels. That was the creation of man. Rachel and Evan have forgiven him. I think... you should, too. [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING]
