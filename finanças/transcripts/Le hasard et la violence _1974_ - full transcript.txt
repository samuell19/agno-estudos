We all need love. To love. To be loved. We are all enclosed within our loneliness. With the same need for love. The only emotion, the only feeling capable of transforming the time we have left that separates us from death. To love. To be loved. We all need love. I'm sorry, but it's not quite what I'm looking for. I'm sorry, but it's not quite what I'm looking for. You're looking for the unattainable. Tell me, what exactly are you looking for in life? What are you doing here? I break windows. When I see a window, I break it. Tomorrow I can show you some other properties. I'll pick you up at the hotel? Has anyone ever told you you're an asshole? Sure. Plenty of times. Good evening. You coming? Is your blood pressure always this high? Yes. Constant pressure. You're lucky. You're able to live off stress. I'm exhausted. I can't do it anymore. May I? Go ahead, doctor. Do you know what I think? Violence, senseless violence, is spreading through the city like a virus. Well… Your name is familiar. I recognize you. There's a photo of you in my son's room. I didn't think anyone read my book anymore. They do. Some students are still very interested in your theories. I, on the other hand, am not so fond of your ideas, Mr. Bermann. The building manager knows how to find me if your hand bothers you. I thought about it, you know. If you want to break windows, you're entitled to it. Do you know… what I think? Violence, senseless violence, is spreading through the city like a virus. -You okay, Dad? -No, Gilbert. You'll have to call Dr. Weber to replace me. Yesterday evening, I treated someone you admire. Yes. The only man whose photo you've ever hung in your room. What? Bermann? No way. He's probably crazy. He could have killed you. Are you going to press charges? Would you have pressed charges? I think most people would. Most people, sure. Captain Müller, great war veteran. Captain Müller, great war veteran. Captain Müller… LAURENT BERMANN CHANCE AND VIOLENCE Detective Tanner. May I have a word? Yes, certainly. A friend of mine called about your… accident. Could I talk to you about it? I have nothing to say. It was like a traffic accident, they sometimes happen. I don't agree. It's not the first time. We've been warned about that guy. Your testimony could help me identify him. As you wish, Mr. Bermann, but I had hoped for a little more cooperation. Listen, Mr. Tanner, I study violence. I don't try to repress it. I don't know if condemning it serves a purpose. It's just a part of life. Do you have something to write with? I see that you do. -May I? -Hang on. Call me on this number if you change your mind. You can tell the charming young lady who was your informant that I'll no longer be requiring her services or her agency's. I'm such a moron! Spineless. Very well, Mr. Bermann. Hello, switchboard? I'd like to speak to Dr. Morgan, please. "One should be able to see things as hopeless and yet be determined to make them otherwise." F. Scott Fitzgerald. I therefore decided… Don't move, please. As you wish. I've seen you once before. In the train station. Possibly. Not like this, though. Maybe. Who are you? May I move now? Please forgive me. -I'm Dr. Weber. -I see. I'm replacing Dr. Morgan, who treated you yesterday. He's very ill. Does it hurt when I touch you here? A little. Flex your hand. I don't think it's broken, just a bad sprain. It must hurt a lot. I'll give you a shot of Novocaine. It's for me. Hello? Yes, this is Dr. Weber. You were right to. I'll be there shortly. I'm sorry, I have to go. I'll be back later. What is it, Constance? You seem troubled. -Dr. Morgan died this morning. -Morgan? He's the doctor I covered for once in a while. Did you know him well? No, not very well. He was a remarkable man. Gerard, would you get me a tall glass of lemon juice? I'll never get used to death. Dad, what's wrong with her? Is she angry? No, my darling. She's not angry. But you know she's a doctor. Of course I do. Well, doctors get very tired by the end of the day. Sometimes it's a bit too much. They see a lot. -You understand? -Of course I do. You only have to explain. Didn't I ask for lemon juice? Gerard, please forgive me. DIRECTOR J. PELIKAN It's an honor to be visited by such an eminent criminologist. But what can I show you? You know, this establishment isn't a model prison. We still use the old methods and the buildings date back to… Listen, it's quite simple. Since I've been here, nearly 40 years, it hasn't changed. Yes, I know. I know. Over 42 people have committed suicide out of desperation in this country's prisons in a single year. But I'm not here because of my work. I've actually come here on a kind of pilgrimage. Do you mind if I look at your files from 1945? BERMANN, LAURENT - 22/3/45 I spent some time here myself. An unfortunate miscarriage of justice, you might say. But this stay drove me to dedicate my life to the study of violence and its repression. I've seen a lot of prisons all over the world. They all have the same smell. May I see my old cell? Number 8. That unfortunate miscarriage of justice cost me ten years of my life. I thought I would go mad. One year later, I was released. They'd caught the culprit. But, you know, I wasn't going to rot here. -I had prepared my escape. -Of course. Constance Weber. I came back. Good evening, Doctor. You kept me waiting. I had good reason to. Well, come upstairs, doctor. I hope you'll stay a little longer this time. Where were we? You gave me a shot but didn't do my bandage. I had to take care of myself. And what did you do while you waited for me? A trip down memory lane. And you? Even though I face pain and death each day, I can never get used to it. This is why I need love. I'm not a professional writer, despite my deep love of blank sheets of paper, ink and pens. But a few years back, I wrote an essay on violence and I self-published it. Listen, if you don't agree with my suggestion, please say so. I would like to be as open with you as I have been up to now. We're going to go back to my room in the hotel. And we'll spend an enjoyable evening. I published my book with no expectations, and it did surprisingly well. Especially with certain students, who took it as a kind of manifesto. Things took a turn I didn't like so I refused to republish and turned down all interviews and publicity. I even spent a few years abroad. Despite this, I felt I was at odds with myself. So, I recently decided to write a response to my book. I chose this town because I didn't know anyone here. And yet, for a period in my life, this town left quite a mark on me. I searched for a house that offered peace and quiet, and the atmosphere I need for writing. I didn't find the house. But I found you instead. You're not that good-looking, you know. Your nose is too big. -A big mouth… -A big… You have a wrinkle here and another one right here. Can I call you Laurent? -Or my love? -As you wish. I like… I like "my love". Is that okay with you? You won't be taken seriously like that, Dad. What else can I do, my darling? I have to earn a living. Go on, answer it. Hello, Constance. You're sleeping away from home now? Are you proud of yourself? Nadine, let me live my life. Don't hang up, I'll put your brother on. She has no shame. Unbelievable. You little floozy. I think you've lost all credibility with your niece. As for me, I'm horrified. Any phone calls for me? The other day at the station, I thought that was your husband and daughter. You should have asked. Frankly, I didn't really worry me at the time. Six months ago, Gerard's wife committed suicide. With no explanation. But the kitchen walls were covered in unintelligible scribbles. Gerard was at the opera. Nadine was at school. He's a musician. They came to live with me. It sounds like she thinks of you as her mother. Not really, I think she just needs me. I need you too, now. I have so much work today. Morgan's death has left us with a lot of problems. Shall we meet at 5 p.m. on the dock? -We'll try to be selfish. -We will be selfish. -And blind. -And deaf. Like a couple of bourgeois. No, like every couple. I'M STAYING WITH YOU! "You no longer need medication. Since last night, I brought you peace and you brought me a storm. With the love you give me and the love you receive, we're the same age. I am your cure, and you are mine." Well done, old boy. What a guy that Bermann is! Strong and sure of himself. The whole package! You poor fool. At your age, are you crazy? At my age? What's that supposed to mean? This kind of thing creeps up on you. What's more, did you hear what she said? "I am your cure and you are mine." Well? BAKERY - CONFECTIONERY Say, is this going to take long? Are you speaking to me, madam? Is there a problem with my cakes? Aren't they fresh enough? Madam, your cakes smell of shit. Get out of my shop, you vulgar man! Careful! You mustn't provoke me, madam! -Is this the man who attacked you? -Yes. I owe you an apology for the other day. But why? Don't worry about it. You know, I read your book too, Mr. Bermann. I was especially interested in your theories of violence and your ideas around objective chance. Things happen, people meet, they cross paths, they get lost and they signal each other without realizing. And all of this is due to apparent chance. Actually, maybe everything is connected. Don't you think? You understood correctly about chance. As for violence, viscerally, man is pushed towards it, to prove to himself he exists while playing the game. Mr. Tanner, if you please. Perhaps everything in life has meaning. You might have bumped into that madman one more time. And he was undoubtedly destined to murder you. The baker may have saved… your life. Now you are immune. Aren't they beautiful? Yes, indeed. What's wrong? Nothing. I found it so wonderful that I bought the same boat the next day. And almost every evening, I come here to watch the sun go down and the city light up. I feel like the town fills my eyes. Is that your way of doing yoga? It's beautiful. Constance Weber. I would like to know how many men have told you that you have the same name as the woman Mozart loved. Constance Weber, how many men have told you that? Quite a few. Yes, I've been loved, but it's far better to love, to suffer because of someone, to be jealous of someone. -I would like to know how many women… -Quite a few. No! Help me. Give me your hand. Come in, the water's fine. I'm fine. Wait! And now, the crescendo! No! With the crescendo! Before the 2-4, it's okay. And the crescendo begins! That's what's missing, the crescendo has to come in. One more time! No! Push now. Take note. From the same place. Away we go. Rock 'n' roll is back again! Your friend is completely hammered. My darling, you're doing everything that's not allowed. You drink, you dance, you make love in cold water. He's going to end up dead. You're sapping the life out of him. Are you going to die? Am I really sapping the life out of you? -It's about time… -He speaks! It's about time I get a check-up by an experienced doctor. Mr. Bermann, follow me, please. Mr. Bermann, doctor. Mr. Bermann. My love, I see you. I see your body as you'll never see it. Everything looks normal. Really? And what is a woman in love? Precisely. A woman in love is a criminal. Why? Because love is a crime that requires an accomplice. Not my words, they're Baudelaire's. And your book, how's it coming along? THE VIOLENCE OF CHANCE ESSAY (2) DELIVERY RECORD 12-5-1945 You know, this case is fascinating. I'd like to speak with him if possible. For you, certainly, but not for too long. This way, please. Hello, Constance. I need to see you. I've done something quite serious. I gave a man the chance for a new life. I need to talk to you about it. And I want to tell you who I really am. Okay. Wait there, I'm coming. Mr. Bermann, please. He's not here, miss. He might be across the road, on the beach. Thank you. What if I screw you against this wall? With your nice white dress and fancy looking shoes, you prim and proper little slut. Get over here! Come here! Laurent! Laurent! Stop! No! To love. To be loved. We all need love.
