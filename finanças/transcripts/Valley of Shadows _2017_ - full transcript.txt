Come! Why? I have something to show you. What? Come on! Stay here, Rapp! VALLEY OF SHADOWS Come! Look at this one. He's killing them just for fun. It sure looks that way. Have you reported it in? I won't let him take any more. I'm going to bring the dog and say he got attacked. You be careful with that. It was a werewolf that killed the sheep. Look, he eats children as well. He becomes dangerous when there is a full moon. There will soon be a full moon again. Why are you coming here at this hour? I haven't seen him since the last time you were here. What has he done? I can't tell you any details now. But, he is out of control. He is aggressive and violent. I have to find him. You have to answer me honestly. Has he been here? No. We barely had any contact these last few years. It has been difficult. You know that! Yes, I know that. But let's go check his room. Aslak? Just stay here, okay? You can see that he has not been here for a while. Get out, now! Mom? Oh God, Aslak! I'm so sorry. I just had to do something. He ate the intestine. Was it the werewolf? Yes. You know you're not allowed in here! Can I sleep over at Lasse? You know I don't like you being around him. He is a little old to be your friend. Don't you think? Does he treat you nicely? - Aslak, are you listening to me? - Yes. I guess it's fine. I'll get your toothbrush. Do you need a sleeping bag? No. Are you sleeping? No. Is that your brothers poster? Yes, he gave it to me. I have the CD too. - Do you know him well? - Who? Your brother. So so. Why does the monster kill for fun? I don't know. Do you think they will catch him? Maybe. 1 think I know where he is hiding. Where? In the forest up on the mountain. - How do you know that? - I just know. - Has your father told you that? - No. - So how? - I just know. It's up there. Do you know the way? Yes. Are we going there? Yes. Do you dare enter the forest? In there. Come on, Aslak. Come, Aslak! Aslak, come. Run, Aslak. Run! Run to that side! Go there! Now you can catch it. - What is that? - A trap. They have injected poison in the meat... so it will kill the monster. Move back a bit so you don't catch fire. Just stay here. ...no one can understand! What a nice drawing. Do you want something else to drink? - I have to go the toilet. - Should I follow you? I can go myself. The door is around the corner at the end of the hallway. Ok. I was the only one looking for him at night. I called everybody and looked everywhere. No one cared about him. No one but me. But I had no other choice than to tell him to leave. He was tearing everyone apart! But you people have just let this happen. Just another dead junkie. But he was my son! Come! Rapp! Rapp! Rapp! Rapp! I'm sure he will be back tomorrow. If not, we will go look for him. Sleep now, ok? Mom? Rapp isn't back yet. Mom? Rapp! Rapp! Rapp! Rapp! Rapp! Hi. Hi. What are you doing around here? I'm looking for my dog. What happened? He ran away. Why did he do that? I don't know. What kind of dog is it? A border collie. What color? Black and white. What is his name? Rapp. Rapp. Nice name... but I haven't seen any dog around here. Do you like it here in the forest? You have to be careful. You can get lost. Are you lost? Hello? Doesn't mom get worried when you are gone? Or maybe there is another reason you are here? Is everything okay at home? You don't talk much, do you? Are you scared of me? Can't you please show yourself? Did I scare you? I didn't mean to scare you. Listen! I hope everything is okay with Rapp. Your dog? Did you eat my dog? No I haven't. I would never eat your dog. Why are you saying that? Because the monster ate the sheep. I'm sure he's fine. Are you the monster? What we don't understand scares us. So we need a monster to blame. Are you still scared of me? No. You have so many thoughts. You and your nightmares. I can feel your fear. Just let it go... and sleep now. Rapp! Over here! Hi. - Are you Aslak? - Yes. I'm Ã˜yvind from Red Cross. - Are you cold? - Yes. It's going to be fine. We will get you home. Aslak! - Did you sleep well? - Yes. That is good. - How do you feel? - Good. That's good. You don't have to go to school today. Should we make a nice breakfast together? Look who is here! Rapp? - Hi. - Hi. - How nice of you to bring him. - I found him outside the barn. - Oh. - Is Aslak at home? Aslak is not feeling well today. - So he has to stay home. - Ok. - But you can play another day. - Yes. Thank you for bringing Rapp. There was never enough time to get to know your brother. You look all grown up. Your trousers are upstairs in the bathroom. Can you put them on? We have to go now.
