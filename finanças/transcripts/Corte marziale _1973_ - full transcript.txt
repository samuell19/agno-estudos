These continual encroachments by the Confederates must stop, Lieutenant. I don't doubt it. I am sure that even if they wear our uniforms they will slip up sooner or later. Let's hope so. I have great trust in you, Warren. You will leave on patrol and when you reach the border divide your men into two groups. They won't escape you. After the mission, let Sergeant Ferguson guard the prisoners. Of course there will be some. You will then join Colonel Stratford at the agreed place, okay? Certainly, sir. Agreed. - Good luck. - Thank you. I'll be back as soon as I have those papers from Colonel Stratford. Greetings. On a special mission? No, only patrolling. The password? I don't have to tell the first colleague I meet. You could be a disguised Confederate operating against our government. There seem to be quite a few around here. It's a well thought-out trick to dress up as Union soldiers and then carry out espionage and disturbances across the border. Yeah. A simple and elementary trick like Columbus's egg. A little game which sometimes succeeds and sometimes not. Lucky for us. Undo your belt. Hands up. Come on, move! Everyone in, come on. Good, very good. I said everyone. Come on. Come on, everyone in. Come on. You too. Get a move on! Hurry up, Lieutenant, before this starts spitting. Let's carry it inside. You get this wagon out of the way. Sergeant, you take care of everything. The second group is coming. Good. Now, we just have to wait. And I think for a while. These documents are burning a hole in my pockets. Let's hope Lieutenant Warren is on time. Heaven help if this gets into the hands of the Confederates. Who would know what we are bringing? The mission has been prepared in great secrecy, you know it as well as I do. Sergeant, don't forget that in war precautions are never too few. - Prepare the coffee instead. - Yes, sir. Really great. Just what was wanted. Here are the documents. Here's the wagon. It must be there. We have visitors. I bet they are looking for me. - Go inside. - Yes. I didn't expect to find you so soon. You've not come very far. I was convinced you'd have taken flight like a bird. I don't understand your arrogance, sergeant. You will understand when you stand before your very own court martial. And who have I murdered, General Grant? Not really. Arrest him. Come on. Let's move. Gentlemen, the pendant you are looking at was found at the place where Colonel Stratford was killed. A pendant that appears to have belonged to Lt. Warren. What do you want to insinuate, Captain? Do you recognize it? Certainly, sir. It's mine. Therefore you confirm it. I ask the president of this court-martial to observe the exhibit and ask for it to be admitted as evidence. Lt. Warren, would you like to clarify how you came into possession of this item? I won it at a darts contest in Montana. I know you are a very good player. As his direct superior I have seen this several times. I don't understand where you want to go, Captain. I want only to demonstrate that you are responsible for the death of Colonel Stratford. And now. I will reconstruct for this court the facts. As is clear from the indictment, the lieutenant had been tasked with collecting top-secret documents. Instead... arriving at the scene... I never had those documents to pass them to the enemy. It's all false. Silence. Speak only when you are questioned. I ask the court to introduce as prosecution witness Sgt. Ballinger. Fine, let the witness be brought. Sergeant Ballinger. - Name and rank - Sgt. Ballinger. - Are you ready to testify? - Yes, sir. Tell the court what you know about the killing of Colonel Stratford and the sergeant who was with him. After Lt. Warren separated from the group, I thought it best to follow him. Well? Go ahead. I'd a good view, it was he who killed them both. After that he went over to the horses and removed a parcel from the Colonel's saddle. I was the one who collected his gold pendant. It was right next to the officer's body. It was pure chance that I found it. Lieutenant, what do you have to say in your defence? It was part of Captain Simpson's orders to leave the platoon. By his specific order, I was to meet with Colonel Stratford alone. That's not correct. Rather I can assure this court that the orders I received were to recover the package from HQ. But on reaching the place of the meeting I saw the bodies of Colonel Stratford and the sergeant on the ground, while two men took possession of the documents. I recognized them. They were the Smith brothers, two well known arms dealers. I immediately started shooting. And I began to chase them. But I lost their tracks as soon as they entered the woods. I then thought of going to HQ to report, but on the way back my horse lost a shoe. I had a long wait for the farrier to arrive. And that was where the sergeant joined me to arrest me. President. Before formulating a guilty verdict against my client. I request that the Smith brothers be immediately tracked down and forced to testify to this court. Well, gentlemen, I think it is necessary for Lt. Warren's trial to be postponed for the necessary time. What is it, Jane? I'm thinking of what has happened to Clint, uncle. I'm sure he's the victim of a conspiracy. My brother, he couldn't have done all this. Yes, yes, of course. Listen, my child. I have to tell you something. Come on, dear, sit down. Speak, uncle, don't keep me in suspense. Listen carefully, Jane. It's to do with the trial. If he is truly innocent, the truth will come out. I'm certain. - Really? - Of course. I don't believe too much in the justice of men. It's often mistaken. No, you must have faith in justice. I can't intervene, if that's what you want. Yes, your prestige would be at stake. As a retired general I can't intrude. I also believe him innocent and I wish I could prove it. But you won't even raise a finger to try and help him. You have always been against my brother. Admit it. Not only... it's as if, as if you were almost envious of him. - I can't understand you, uncle. - Are you done talking nonsense? It's not nonsense, it's the truth. Is it possible that you have no heart? You're worse than a stranger, Clint needs you now. Help him now, please. Help him. In my position I cannot compromise myself. Yeah, your position. That's all you worry about, but Clint is under arrest and risks facing a firing squad. Oh, uncle. How can you allow him to take such a risk. Alright then. I'll see what can be done. I'll try to examine the trial proceedings. But it takes proof, both to condemn and to exonerate. If the truth were to be in his favour, so much the better. I'll be the first to be happy and congratulate him. Are you satisfied now? Yes, now I recognize you. Run right away. Get those files. Every moment is precious, - Clint could be shot at any moment. - No. - That never. - Why not? Try to think. Please, if you want to see me happy. Please, swallow your pride. Can't you do this for your little girl. Clint is a fine boy. If you really want to, no one can doubt his innocence. Alright. I will try to please you. I mean that I will do everything in my power. The night brings counsel. Good night, my dear. I'll get to work tomorrow. After all, he too is my nephew. Sure, uncle. Forgive me, good night. - Sleep well. - Good night. To what do I owe the honour of this visit? Pure courtesy, dear friend. Just walking around to check if everything is in order. I'm always interested in the health of my prisoners. I came to inform you that tomorrow this trial nonsense will be over. And for you there will be nothing but the firing squad. Are you really so sure? I hope to be in charge of it. It's always me who gives the coup de grace. You've already done so by falsely testifying. Anyway, before arriving at certain satisfactions, you will have to wait for the arrest of the Smith brothers. You think so? I fear that testimony will be a lifetime away. The two Smith brothers have literally disappeared, my friend. Nobody will be able to question them. Because the jurors are already assembled to deliver their verdict, which will be "guilty". Nor can the intervention of your beloved uncle help to restore your hope of salvation. You are nothing but filthy scum, Ballinger. Stop. I was lucky to catch you. A few more moments... And you'd have flown the coop. Will you and your brother come to the fort now to testify? Testify, I don't understand. It doesn't matter, you will. - But I... - Where is John? I don't know. He's been gone a long time. Where to? Talk if you value your skin. I want to know where he is. And where are the documents stolen from the colonel? I don't know what you are talking about. I didn't... Come on, spit it out! He's at the old post station. Towards the border. And where are the documents? Damn it! Tommy! Mum, hurry. It's dad. Clint. Hi, dad. Why have you been away for so long? Duty. You know what the army is like. Is everything fine? What happened? I've escaped. Maybe you shouldn't have. Better talk to Anthony. He will advise you. Come on, let's go in. How he's grown. Here I am at home. Tommy... - Where are you going? - I'm going to call uncle. Clint, are you sure you did right? Won't you have made things worse for yourself? I don't know, Helen... but I'm afraid that I will have to flee. And I'll have to be alone again without knowing where you are. Constantly worried about what may happen to you. I'm afraid, Clint, I'm afraid for you and for little Tommy. You needn't be afraid. Trust me. At the old post station maybe I'll find the evidence of my innocence. Here's uncle, dad. Hi, Anthony, how are you doing? Getting by. They released you, huh? Then, sister, what are we doing. - Are we eating? - Yes, of course. Your wife is really good in the kitchen. I know. Did your husband come through here? He's in prison at the fort, didn't you know? No ma'am, Clint has escaped from the fort. I thought he'd have stopped off at the house. I'm a friend of his, I have to find him at any cost. I have some very important news that can clear him of the accusations. I'm sorry, but I can't tell you anything. That's okay if he shows up, tell him to go to the village of San Jose. There he will find someone who could be useful to him. Goodbye. - What are you doing here? - I came from your house, Clint. Helen sent me. She told me a man in a dark suit came looking for you. He said he was your friend but she didn't trust him. - Who was he? - Wait. He said, he told Helen you have to go to San José. - Did you say to San José? - Yes, that's it. It's all very strange. - Go back now. - Why? I think it's a trap. And I fell for it. Don't worry. But it's better you get away. So they will think there's no one here. Yes. Didn't it cross your mind that someone could have followed you? Don't worry, you'll see that I'll manage. - Now you'd better get home. - Alright. Wait. Go ahead. - Good luck. - Bye. Hey Warren, come out. Look what a pretty little dove I've caught. Come outside. What are you waiting for? Ballinger. I would have sworn it. Come out with your hands up, if you care about your little sister's life. Clint listen to me, it was my fault. Don't listen to him, run away you've got time! You have a very attractive sister, you know. But come out now. It's your last warning. Okay, I'll come down. I give up. But on one condition. Let Jane go. You have my word, throw down your gun and I'll let her go. And no funny business, Warren, or I'll kill her. Now let her go. One more minute, gorgeous. I need your help. Take that rope and tie your brother's hands behind his back. Hurry up. I'd advise you to do a good job. Thank you very much, now you can go. Come on, get on your horse. I'm sorry, Clint. It's a shame. I'd just made some coffee. Good. Good idea, let's have coffee, then we'll go to the fort. What a nice smell. Get on the bed. It must be excellent. - What are you doing with that gun? - You scared me. Unfortunately I haven't found the documents I was looking for. - What will you do now? - I don't know exactly. However I found a wagon. There were rifles, which means Smith must have passed by. - Clint! - Hello, brother-in-law. I was telling Helen about the guns I found. An important clue. It's proof that Freddy Smith told the truth. Let's go into the house, it's cold here. Yes, let's go. - And you'll be starving. - Sure. Leave it, I'll do it. I'm a specialist you know. You're always the best, dad. Take off your jacket, Tommy. They smell nice. - Your uncle's looking for you. - What does the old man want? - To meet you. - Meet me? But he's never been able to stand me. Fine. For the occasion, I'll have to put my uniform back on. The general cares. He told Helen where he will wait for you. At the Red Rocks tomorrow at six. Strange. I never understood his dislike, he almost seems jealous of my career. Maybe because for so many years he never managed to be a good officer. They retired him ahead of time, didn't they? Yes, that's it. He became a general by playing... poker with a senator. See, Tommy, how to get ahead? By the way, Helen, have you got a uniform of mine? Yes, dear, the best you have. Still no sign of him. I should have known that a guy like you couldn't be trusted. Why don't you ask me how things went before you accuse me? I heard the shots. And now you appear with the wagon, not many explanations are needed to understand what happened. If I was with the Confederates I wouldn't have come to the appointment. I needn't have passed this way. Instead you did pass this way. And when you saw some soldiers you didn't hesitate to shoot. You're wrong. You've miscalculated, as I'll be the one to report you. Leave that rifle on the ground. Now listen well. Why don't you kill me too like you did with Stratford. Because I didn't kill the colonel. - It was John Smith. - Smith? Now you'll have to believe me. Forget personal grudges for once. Continue. But why do you hate me now? You raised me as a son. Help me. And together we'll find proof of my innocence. I've an idea the old man at the mine can tell me something about John Smith. - Take the wagon back. - We can't waste time. - Let's go to your ranch right away. - As you like. It will be a pleasure to see my sister again. Did Helen warn you that I was free? Yes. You finally brought Clint back to me. Yes, as you can see. - I'll leave immediately. - Oh no. I'm still under indictment, Jane. Let's waste no more time. We need to send the wagon away, it could be a compromising clue. But now I'm tired. We'll meet again later at dinner. Fine, uncle. A cookie, uncle? You made them just right. Tomorrow we're going to find John Smith. He was very close friends with the keeper of the silver mine. A nice old man I know too. I see. The only difficulty is that the mine is closely guarded. There are three guards. One here. The other two on the trail. I'll try tonight. And with a bit of luck the army can get their hands on the real culprit. The old man will surely give me the news I seek. Once I got him out of a nasty jam. He owes me. You'll see, from him I'll discover where John Smith is hiding. Let's hope so. I have to succeed. I'd hate to end up in front of a firing squad. Try not not to expose yourself too much. Prudence, Clint, is always the best policy. Such a great idea. I do believe you've got yourself into a trap. A trap with no exit, dear nephew. Hey. Good night and sweet dreams. You were waiting for me? Don't try it. Throw it at my feet. That's it, good. Now go. I'd hate to send you to the land of dreams. Look, what a surprise, it's Lieutenant Warren's ghost. But weren't you to be shot for high treason? - You got away, by golly. - As you can see, I'm still alive. Listen to me well, Clint Warren. It gives me so much pleasure, so much pleasure to see you again. Damn this whole story, believe me, I don't like it at all. Yes, I know. That's why I came to you, old friend. Good friends. need to help each other. I'm listening, Clint. If I can help you in anything you can ask freely. You know that I have an old debt of gratitude towards you. You saved my skin and I'll never forget that, Clint. You can trust me, you know. After all I'm sure that you are innocent. But for all your innocence I might come a cropper if I help you. See, my friend, I want to be honest. And I don't want to go to jail for sticking my nose in other people's business. And the army will throw me in jail if I give you so much as apiece of bread or a place to sleep. Don't be afraid. What I need is to know where the man who killed Colonel Stratford is. Right, and you want to know from me? Isn't John Smith your friend? He hasn't shown up for ages. You could show me someone who knows where he is. Come. Do you still hope to find him? He's as crafty as a fox, dear Clint, otherwise you'd have found him. Where do you want him to hide? In the mountains, of course. So, you know something after all. Speak. Where is John Smith? What's so funny, you old fox. I've the impression, my friend, that you are not using your brains at all. Remember that half-mad federal agent? Go to him. He's sacristan at the church of San Pedro. He'll tell you something. Finally got your tongue to work. Come, show me the way. Strange place to negotiate such a deal, right? Yeah. We might as well be sightseeing. I can't see a soul. Right, no sacristan. But we hear someone. A great artist. Come and wait over there. If he's the man he'll finish playing soon. He's on his way. Sorry I'm late. But music is my tyrant. I too would like to be a slave to a tyrant like yours. - She is the mistress of my spirit. - Sure, by the way, do you recognize Lt. Warren? Oh my lord... Did he really escape? I hope it's for a good reason. But now, gentlemen, the faithful are looking forward to my music. It's a pleasure to listen to it. Thank you. I am the humble interpreter of great souls. I don't want to waste your time, we'll get straight to the point. In fact, Lt. Warren will tell you. I'm all ears. To get to the point, the caretaker of the mine asserts that you are able to show me where a man is hiding. That's the cabin. Look for yourself. Yes, that's it. Good. I'll return alone. Let's go. Get down and raise your hands. No funny business, understood? Get down. Give me the gun. Come on, I've got him. Come on, hit him. Like this. Come on, kill him, like this. Stop! Idiots. I want him alive. For real? He has to be taken to the farmhouse. I'm the one who got the orders. And I know how to behave. John, I say kill him first. He means we'll say we found the handsome lieutenant already dead. This man is a ball and chain for us. And he knows too many things, let's finish him off, boss. Take him to the old farmhouse. Sure, boss. Relax, I'll take care of it. Move. Let's go for a nice walk. You go inside. And hurry. Hi, Ballinger. As agreed, the lieutenant is in the old farmhouse. You can go get him whenever you want and make him disappear. He's well guarded. Now it's your turn. Dear Smith, Ballinger always keeps his promises. But I... - Dirty traitor! - Inside! - Do you really want to go to the fort, Clint? - Yes. I need to go back. But don't you think it will be dangerous? No, I don't think so. With Jane's testimony I'm quite safe. I have to go. But why so soon? - Would you mind getting my horse ready? - I'll help him. Bye, Anthony. See you soon. Good luck. Announce me to the captain. Yes, sir. Come in. It's Lieutenant Warren. Sir. How dare he come back here? Show him in. Hands up. Good morning, Captain. How are you? And you, lieutenant? Not bad. Would you like to lower your gun, please? Witty too. I wouldn't be in your place. Really? And why not? My uncle is ready to report you if I don't send him a message by tonight. So put that gun away. Otherwise.... I don't believe you, Lieutenant, it's a bluff. Be careful, Simpson. I've found the evidence I need to prove my innocence. I'm really sorry, right? You were wrong to send Ballinger to find me. He used my sister to recover me and now she can testify. My compliments, Warren. Thank you. Too kind. But I'm afraid I'll have to report you, sir. You were smart, Warren, but not smart enough. in fact you are back at the fort, with me. Captain, I'm sorry to tell you that it's you who will end up in front of the firing squad. You look very confident, lieutenant, but be warned I will certainly find a way to send you to your death. Urgent. - From HQ, sir. - Good. What happened? Take off your belt. Lock him up! What do you think, lawyer? As you saw, I fought. - But there wasn't a... - General. Enter the court. The charges being examined and the witnesses heard, the court finds Lieutenant Clint Warren guilty of high treason and sentences him to twenty years of hard labour. The penalty will be applied immediately. Take him away. That's all gentlemen. Captain. Work, you sons of bitches. Come on, you bastard. Don't expect any pity from me, get up! Come on, try to get up. Remember, you're not here on vacation. I can't take it anymore. I'd rather die. No food tonight and I'll have you whipped. Don't stand there staring, get back to work! If you want to eat, move! Miserable bastard. If you don't get up right away, I'll have you whipped. Enough of this messing around. I'll make you curse the day you came into this world. See you can do it? You just need the whip. You, Warren, get a move on. Back to work. What are you waiting for? Come on! Come on. Want to come to a bad end? Mangy dog! Don't move. Bastard. Stop! I will make you wish you had never been born! Not for one moment. With this stunt you've landed yourself with a sentence ten times worse. I'll never have such fun. Tie him to the wheel and see that he always faces the sun. No bread and water. I'll leave you one, two, three days, until the sun has dried up your veins. And that will only be the beginning. Come on, take him away. I want to enjoy the show. Come on. And you keep working. Faster, you swine! Take a good look at the sun. And don't think that I have come to shade you. Soon, your blood will begin to boil in your veins. Have you heard, my dear lieutenant? If you are not thirsty I shan't force you to drink. But maybe tomorrow or the day after. Call me when you are cooked. Then I'll test you every now and then with a fork. And now five miles on foot will stretch your legs a little. Then you can sleep. Between bedbugs and lice. Come on, march, move out! C'mon. Go to sleep. Life here is very hard. Good night. Really, I just can't understand. Why take such good care of me. Because I feel sorry for you. Have you wondered why I'm here like you, Warren? In fact, I have. You can tell me if you want. It was a way as good any other to get rid of a dangerous witness. Sending me here is a death sentence, knowing my precarious health conditions, he knew that in a place like this I couldn't survive and would remain forever silent. Who are you talking about? Captain Simpson, it's him, responsible for everything, that bastard. Through Sergeant Ballinger, he ordered me to kill Colonel Stratford and get hold of the documents. And where are they now? I think he keeps them in his office safe. Sooner or later he will take them to his hideout at the old farm. Listen, I have to get out of here and you will come with me. There's too much... too much surveillance. You'll see we'll succeed, don't worry. I have nothing more to lose. What are you two doing? Blow out the candle, it's time to sleep. Hurry up or tomorrow you'll get a good whipping. I'll go with you Warren. I want to live to see that pig in jail. What's going on in there? Sleep or I'll send you to the punishment cell. - You can do it. - Stop! I can't continue anymore. Go on alone. I've had enough. Come on, you have to do it. C'mon, you can do it. - C'mon. - I can't continue any more. Save yourself. For me it's the end. Clint, save yourself. John, John. For this one it's over. Let's go back, we won't catch the other one now. You're right, we'll notify HQ. - What news of Warren? - Bad, unfortunately. That damn man can't be found even though we've unleashed uniformed and plain clothed men throughout the territory. John Smith must have certainly squealed before he died. And I fear that for you, dear captain, things are looking very bad. - Now Warren had the proof that you work for the Southerners. - Enough! I won't let you talk to me like that. You have to find him at all costs, idiot. I don't see why I should continue to expose myself. All I need do is change my testimony to get out of it. And what will you do? Will you apologize for the time you put him to hard labour, Ballinger? We are now in the same boat and we'll drown together. There is no way out for you either, as you well know. I don't think so. Just spill the beans and I'm safe. But it won't be that easy for you. I've already told you that the only thing is to take him out as soon as possible. Don't think I'd mind breaking his neck. So what are we waiting for? He must be found and killed immediately. No, friend, it doesn't suit me anymore. Silence! I'm in charge here. And don't you forget it. But who are you in charge of? You're just a dirty traitor who passes news to the South for money. So what are you? Certainly not that timid sergeant you want to look like. Listen to me, if we want to save ourselves we must act immediately. Now go. And do a good job. Get a move on. - Did you call me? - Yes Ballinger, sit down. I've given it some thought and I've come to the conclusion that we need to have disappear immediately all the clues that can harm us. Starting with you! Hi there, Captain. Stop. Captain Simpson. These documents are the equivalent of a conviction. - Sergeant. - Yes, sir. - Arrest this man. - You two. Ready. Aim. Aim. Fire! Subtitles: corvusalbus
