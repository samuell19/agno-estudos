The Temple Mount in Jerusalem is one of the world's most mysterious and mystical sites. It's also one of the most fiercely contested pieces of real estate on the planet. Since the destruction of the second temple by the Romans in the year 70 of the Common Era, there has been no Jewish temple here. From the beginning of Islam, in the seventh century, the Temple Mount has been dominated by its Muslim monuments. The Al-Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of the Rock. For Muslims, this is not the Temple Mount. But rather, the Haram al Sharif, the Noble Sanctuary. The Dome of the Rock is the oldest existing Islamic monument, and one of the great architectural wonders of antiquity. It was built on top of Mount Moriah, the holy mountain. This rock is considered to be the spot where the world and its first human being, Adam, were created. Religious Jews await the Messiah and the third temple. Today, the temple is rebuilt as scale models only. Will these models become reality? And will a Jewish temple replace the mosques? Who does not want to own the holiest place on Earth? For almost two years, I wandered through Jerusalem with my camera to find an answer on this why, the why of this sacred site that has seen so much bloodshed. - There is a phrase that says: this one who rules over the holy mount, rules over Jerusalem. And that one who rules over Jerusalem, rules over the land, the Holy Land. - There's going to be a war on Jerusalem, like has been prophesied, and the prophet Ezekiel and Zachariah, and God promised us. There's going to be built a third temple, and it describes there exactly how this third temple is going to be rebuilt. The Bible is our document. Our rights to this place. It is to this holy mountain that Judaism, Christianity, and Islam trace their roots. In each of their traditions, this is the place where the world began, where true faith is conceived, and where the world will come to its conclusion. A tremendous burden of symbolism took place on one, single spot. - We are not authorized. We don't have the mandate from the generations in the past to give up an heritage of our ancient fathers, who paid for it, 4,000 years of self-sacrificing. We cannot, and we don't have a choice. We don't have an alternative. We don't have Saudi Arabia and we don't have the Vatican. We have only Jerusalem. This is the only place, and all the dreams, not only of Zionism, of 100 years, but 4,000 years of dreams, everything is the tears and the blood shed up to the walls of the Old City of Jerusalem. Which the Old City of Jerusalem is nothing in meaning, without the holy mount; the holy mount is the seed of the whole phenomena. - The Temple Mount for us Christians is very important. Remember that Jesus was a Jew, and as a Jew, three times a year he came as a pilgrim to the Temple Mount. Peter and John came to pray to the temple. So they were convinced that God's presence, the , was inside the temple. The fact is that Muslims are not the ones who chose this place. It was Almighty God who chose it, and mentioned it in his holy book. Prophet Muhammad, may his name be blessed, is the last of four prophets, and we believe in all of them. Yet Prophet Muhammad was the last one. That is how the message of Islam came to cover all the previous religions. Because this city, the city of Jerusalem, represents part of the Islamic belief, because it is where Prophet Muhammad ascended to heaven, from Mecca to Jerusalem, and up to heaven. So this city was the pivotal site of Prophet Muhammad's ascending to heaven, in what is known in the Islamic world as an , or mirage. - The name Moriah is mentioned in the 22nd chapter of the first book of the Hebrew Bible. That is the Book of Genesis. The story tells about Abraham, who was told by the almighty to take his son and sacrifice it. And the sacrificial location should be on one of the mountains in the land of Moriah. According to tradition, this is the very spot, chosen by the almighty. It was chosen from the beginning of days, from the time of creation, according to Jewish tradition. And the rock, upon which the binding of Isaac took place, is actually the first rock which was created by the almighty, and the rest of the world was created around it. You must stand here to understand it. You must stand here to understand that a thousand years, before Christianity or Islam even dreamt of being born, King David and King Solomon built here, on this mountain, our temple. These stones, our fathers and sons, fathers and sons. It never stopped, and it won't stop forever. So this meeting, on this temple mount, between God with Abraham and Isaac, was the meeting between the first father, and the first son, and the father of all of us. And this tradition was passed from Isaac to Jacob, and Jacob to his sons, and his sons to King David, King David to King Solomon, and Solomon to his sons, all through history. - The biblical story tells us, in the Book of Samuel, that David purchased the Temple Mount, or the threshing floor of Araunah, the Jebusite, who was the last Jebusite, pre-Israelite ruler of Jerusalem. He purchased the place in full money, and he built there an altar, in order to stop the plague among the people of Israel. It is told also that later on, it was his son, Solomon, who built the, ah, first temple upon that spot. And it is the first temple which will be succeeded by the second temple, and Herod's Temple later on. - In the Temple Mount, in the holiest of the holies, we had the tabernacles, with the two tablets, which on the two tablets was written the 10 Commandments. Which were given directly from God to Moses. And this is the most precious, historical item that the entire world has, from God. And what happened with the tabernacles, with the tablets? We had two temples: the first temple was destroyed by the Babylonians. And the tabernacles were gone, were lost, were taken to Babylon. Never came back. When the Jewish people build the second temple, with the Prophet Ezra, they didn't have the tabernacles and two tablets, but the divine presence of God, the , never left this place. In the time of the temple, the supreme court resided here. The old worked here, and this place, it was the treasury that worked here. The government. The political system. The stock market. The market. When the temple existed, everything was here. Three times a year, all the people of Israel gathered here. They danced here, they were happy. They brought their crops, fruits and vegetables. They brought it to the temple. Millions of people gathered here. When the temple existed, this city meant the source of life. There was only one thing: the temple that was, and with God's help, will be rebuilt in the future. - We are now at the southwestern corner of the Herodian Temple Mount. We can see some of the stones as if tilted downwards. This is the result of the work of the engineering forces of Titus, the Roman emperor who led the siege and destruction of Jerusalem, and the destruction of the second temple. Standing here, looking at these stones, you can imagine, with a little bit of imagination, you can imagine the sounds, the terrible noise of the collapse of these stones. - Every night, I go to our terrace, and I see the Temple Mount. And I know that under the cupola, the gilded cupola, there was the holy of the holies. All the was there. And when the temple was destroyed, the went up to heaven. A few meters from here. - For us Christians, it's a place where Jesus came, many, many times. He, as a small child, was presented to the temple. He did his bar mitzvah at the age of 12. The Gospel of Luke has it, it's very clear that he was really a Jew, an orthodox Jew. He was convinced that the Judaism was the revelation of God. In the Bible, God speaks to humanity. So the Temple Mount has a spiritual purpose for us. - When the temple was destroyed in year 70, the early Christians, who were Jewish Christians, they took all these traditions and they put them to the Holy Sepulcher again. And even the shape of the Holy Sepulcher was built according to the shape of the temple. But the role of the temple was preparatory, for us Christians, because in the Temple Mount were performed sacrifices of animals, through which people were sanctified. But then, Christ came and he was crucified, here near us. We are in the area of Golgotha now, we are in the area of Calvary, and he gave himself once for all. He made himself a sacrifice for our redemption, and forgiving us. In fourth century Saint Helen and Saint Constantine built the Temple of Resurrection. So, after Christ, for us Christians, the temple is this. It is Calvary and the tomb of Christ, Calvary, Christ was crucified, and the tomb from which he was resurrected. The temple has, for us, a religious significance, but we don't claim it, to take it, because it's a place of Judaism, as well, in 638, when Muslims came here, this was the place which according to the tradition, according to the legend, was given, was granted to Umar Khattab from the patriarch of Jerusalem, Sophronius. - It is the oldest existing masterpiece of the Muslim architecture all over the world. It's a school of art; it's a mixing between Byzantine, Roman, Arab, Islam, so I feel this is an integration of human artistic approach. All of these integrated in one building, in one masterpiece. Many prophets passed here. For instance, Jesus, David, Solomon. Each one contributed for that development. It is agreed by archeologists, travelers, historians, that this area continued to be vacant, empty, full of rubbish, for 600 years, after the destruction of the temple. So far, no proof has been discovered that a certain structure or an important one which has any significance was built in this area, before Muslims came here and started to redevelop, rearrange the area according to their needs and beliefs on the importance of the area. - I'm a Muslim from Jerusalem. My family has been here for the past 1,400 years. And Jerusalem, the Dome of the Rock, feels part of me. How to express that in a painting, how to express it in color, is not easy. The colors have a very strong memory. And this color is gold, it is green, it is blue. These are the colors of the Dome of the Rock. This is the colors that evoke the holiness. Green is the holy color of Islam. Gold is the color of light. God is the eternal light, it's the source of all. And blue, this is the sky and the heavens. It's very difficult to talk about what is sacred, what makes the Dome of the Rock, Al-Aqsa Mosque, very sacred. But I'm not comparing now for who it is more sacred. What we are talking about is: what makes it sacred? What gives it that special importance for the Muslims? But by touching this issue, people simplistically usually say: ah, it's sacred because the Prophet Muhammad rode on a black horse, and he came in the sky, all the way from Mecca to Jerusalem. And from there, he ascended to the sky, where he met with God. And thereupon, the rituals related to prayers were clarified to him. When we are talking about Jerusalem, in particular, we have to be very careful about our historical approach to the understanding of religion. The mistake that's often made is believing that there is a historical relationship between the three religions. So when they see the name Moses repeated, or the name Abraham repeated, or the name Noah repeated, it's as though it's the same person. But it's not so. Each one has his own identity, and his own religious system. Each religion should be seen as a closed system, in and of itself. It cannot be studied in comparison to the other religions. Al-Aqsa cannot be like any other spot, anywhere else; Al-Aqsa represents belief. A sacred place, and the site where Prophet Muhammad ascended to heaven. It represents the gathering of the prophets, the followers, thousands of them, who were buried around the Al-Aqsa. Here, there is history. A civilization of Islam in ancient and in modern times alike. As ancient as the days of Adam, and until the arrival of Prophet Muhammad, through Adam, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and the rest of the prophets, like David, Solomon and others. Because we believe in all these messengers of God. The ancient history of Islam, and of Prophet Muhammad, make Al-Aqsa a central question in the daily life of Muslims. - In Islam, there are three holy cities: Mecca, Medina, and , Jerusalem. Mecca is venerated because it has the Kaaba, which is the house built by Abraham. Abraham, the Muslim Abraham, not as the Jews see him, not as the Christians constitute him, but as we understand him in our own holy scripture. Medina has the tomb. It's venerated because it has the tomb of the Prophet Muhammad. And that importance is: why should Jerusalem be important? In Jerusalem, the covenant with Muhammad was confirmed. The same blessing that God had given to Abraham in Mecca, he have to Muhammad in Jerusalem. It is a reconfirmation of the prophecy of the lineage, Abraham, Ismael, Muhammad. It is reconfirmation of the blessing. As soon as you enter the gates of the mosque, you feel you are entering God's heaven, sitting under the shade of olive trees. In Al-Aqsa, you feel your commitment. You walk to be embraced by pillars and holy shrines. Sit on stones, so that your soul goes up in the sky. Look at the domes that embrace the sky and look at the shrines, the trees, the weeping pillars. Those tears of Al-Aqsa, that has up to this moment, suffered from the occupation. There is no identity for Muslims in Palestine, without Al-Aqsa. The existence of Muslim Palestinians is meaningless, without Al-Aqsa. - Jerusalem was never left without Jews in or around it. Here we are, Mount of Olives; as you know, the Mount of Olives is the oldest and still-functioning burial place for the Jewish people. Some of the graves down in the valley date back to the period of the kings of Judea. David's period and Solomon's period and so on. Others kept on going for as long as Jews were around, and they've always been around. Right in front of me here is one of the family graves. It so happens this one, the first name is like mine, Avraham. This one dates back to 1650, or 1652, because all this area around us is a, most of the graves except some new ones, date back to the period 1600-1700. So, members of the family were always buried here. Except the period after '48. Here, inside Al-Aqsa Mosque, this is called the Prayers Hall, the front of the mosque. This dome of Al-Aqsa is on the sound end side, and is used as a prayer site for all men at all times. It has seven corridors, and the one in the middle is topped with a dome, which goes back to the rule. And it goes up, up there in the sky. Sheikh Najeh Bkerat is my closest friend. We are spiritually close with each other. With him, I find in Islam the faith that I seek. It is the realization, ultimately, that we are not alone, but that God is with us. One of my favorite places of meditation is the Cave of Souls,. Inside the cave, there's that feeling of mystery. So you feel you are in the holy of holies of Islam. This is the Cave of Souls in the sense that, on the day of judgment, that all souls of humans, Jews, Christians, Muslims, alike, will be there, and the good and the bad will be sorted out. The bad will be, of course, in hell. The good will be in paradise. Also, we cannot forget that before he ascended to the sky, the Prophet Muhammad is believed to have led all the other biblical prophets in prayer. There's a very special silence that hovers over the place. There's a quiet, and there's an inner peace that you find; it's very special, and within that inner peace, you are aware you're not alone. You have that exalted feeling, that intuition of an overwhelming sensation of being with the transcendent other. You feel it. And that's really the basis of religious feeling. You are not alone. Our being is bound with something beyond us, above us. God. - When Jews were prohibited from living in Jerusalem, and definitely prohibited from going into the temple mountain, the Mount of Olives was a substitute. For that reason, people wanted to be buried here, because according to the tradition, the resurrection, the Jewish resurrection, would start here. That's the center of this, of the burial place. Because it would start here, it means the Messiah has to go through here before he enters Jerusalem. So everyone wanted to be the first on his way. And by the way, all the people buried here are buried in such a way that they face the mountain. They face the temple mountain, and there are some areas here where it used to be more expensive to be buried, because there was a direct view with the Dome of the Rock. At one point after the defeat of the Crusaders, because of the story connected with the Messiah, the Muslims have decided to make other difficulties possible to avoid the Messiah of coming, and avoid therefore the Jewish resurrection. So the golden gate that was an open gate during the Crusaders' period, was blocked by the Muslims, by Salah ad-Din, and they turned the area in front of the gate into a Muslim cemetery. So how can the Messiah go through a cemetery? And indeed, he hasn't arrived yet. You know that. - Jerusalem, during its long history, witnessed many bloody wars, lots of blood was shed, upon its holy sites. The Temple Mount was always the focus of these battles over Jerusalem. But the European Crusaders, who arrived at Jerusalem in the very end of the 11th century, they took over the holy sites from the Muslims, and the whole focus of their coming to the Holy Land was to save the holy sites and to save the Holy Sepulcher, the tomb of Jesus, from the infidels. That is, the Muslims. They took over the sacred shrines of the Muslims, upon the Temple Mount, and turned the Dome of the Rock into a Christian shrine, replacing the Muslim crescent by a cross, and they renamed it: Templum Domini. The Temple of the Lord. The Crusaders were defeated towards the end of the 12th century by Saladin, a Muslim ruler, and Jerusalem fell again into the hands of Islam. - After the Crusaders, really, the Ayyubid Dynasty, which belonged to Saladin, ruled in Jerusalem. And the first focus for them was to make the area as peaceful as possible. And they sure, draw much attention for the Haram, they maintain the buildings, they changed and moved all the Christian symbols or Christian crosses and all that, and they started their renovation program. It is going to be in the hands of the Muslims, up until 1917, when General Edmund Allenby conquered Jerusalem and the Temple Mount was under the official jurisdiction of Great Britain. At the mandate time, the British was wise enough to understand that the religious matter is so sensitive. So, they brought a status quo that each community can take care for their buildings. That's applied for the Aqsa Mosque, for the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, and for other places. - Following their leaving of Palestine, the end of the British mandate, in 1948, a bloody war started again, over Jerusalem. In that battle, the Jewish quarter of the Old City and the access to the holiest of sites for the Jews, the Temple Mount and the Western Wall, being the Wailing Wall, was denied. The historical sites of Jerusalem fell into the area which was conquered by the Hashemite kingdom of Jordan, and it was under Jordanian rule between 1948 and 1967. In 1967, again, a serious bloodshed occurred in Jerusalem in the Six Days War, when the city, together with the Temple Mount, came under the jurisdiction of the state of Israel. I was a seven year old boy. When the Six Days War took place. I remember how I was traumatized when I saw the Wailing Wall for the first time. I dreamt of the wall, as a small child. But it was so ugly here. It's not like now. You know what they had here on the Wailing Wall? Public toilets. This is what they had during '67. It was so insulting. They told about my Wailing Wall, about the temple, and they couldn't understand why it's so neglected, why it's so dirty. - The important thing to realize when we talk Muslim/Jew successions, we are talking about different systems. And when we are talking about geography, this is the important part. The conflict arises because they overlap. So with the Wailing Wall, now, for example, the Prophet Muhammad came, horizontally first, Mecca to Jerusalem, on the Buraq. It's an animal with the body of a horse, with wings, and the face of a woman. He left it at the western wall of the temple, which is the Wailing Wall. For the Arabs, as such, the Wailing Wall is not the Wailing Wall, it is the Buraq. It is the place where that animal was tied, or left. Then Muhammad walked into the sacred area, because that area was too sacred for animals to walk in. So, when we look at the Wailing Wall, how do we see it? We see it as the Waling Wall, or we see it as the Buraq. If you are a Jew, to the western wall of the temple, that's what you'll see of it. If you are a Muslim, you will see it in relation to your religion, which is the place where Muhammad left the Buraq before he entered the mosque area. Why did Muhammad come to the mosque, the Dome of the Rock? Muslims believe this was the mosque of Adam. When God set down Adam, it was there, on the Earth. And that was the place of prayer, and the , the place of prostration and prayers to God, is there. So from Adam's time, this has been sacred. But which Adam? Adam of Islam is different than the Jewish Adam. - Today is one of the most important days for the Jewish people, as far as their mourning for the destruction of the first and the second temple. The Jews all around he world, they go to their synagogues, to sit on the ground, they don't sit on chairs, they read the Book of Lamentation, which Jeremiah the prophet wrote, about the destruction of the first temple and the second temple. A lot of the Jewish people will go to Jerusalem, to the western wall, and they mourn, they cry, and they feel the sadness that the glory of God is not revealed in the world, because the temple represents the glory, the presence of God, on this planet, on the Earth. And that's what the Jewish people and the whole world is missing. The Jewish people carry on this tradition, which is not only a tradition that's written down, to fast on this day, and they're fasting in truth today, for 2,000 years, they will continue on fasting, until we're going to see the rebuilding of this temple. Maybe this year, maybe the next, final year. For hundreds of years, we have been living in this village of Sur Baher, between Jerusalem and Bethlehem. It is a humble village. I work with department, in Al-Aqsa, and I teach in Al Quds University, after I had already graduated in religious studies, in Al Sharia and Islamic heritage. We believe that the problem between Jews and Palestinians is that Jews believe the temple is built on the site of the rock, and that it is located within Al-Aqsa area, but historical researchers and others, Jews, Arabs, and Christians alike, have proved that there is no link to this temple that was destroyed in the days of Quraysh, and that was also destroyed again in the days of Titus. All of this has left nothing of the temple. Is it, by the way, a temple made of wood, or a temple made of stone? We believe the land of Al-Aqsa Mosque has no remains of the temple at all. Therefore, Judaism and Jews worldwide should become convinced that there is nothing called a temple here, and that the temple story is only a myth. Because what is there in our belief, is a mosque for God, a mosque for Muslims. - Just in front of us, we have the minaret. Five times a day, they're inviting people to pray. And to make their confession of faith. There is no other god than Allah, and Muhammad is his prophet. So all the Muslims have to pray five times a day. They are shouting very hard, even at night, at four o'clock in the morning, they're waking us up. Why are they shouting so much? Because, eh, it has a political meaning. We are the masters of the city. Nobody else has to come here. We are ruling here. They're claiming that the land is belonging to them. But Abraham has many sons. We know it from the Bible. He has Isaac, he has Ismael, and the Christians claim to be sons of Abraham, according to the Spirit. So if there's only one land, and two people, and three religions, you must share the same land between all the sons of Abraham. The Christians must be a bridge between Jews and Islam. Because many Christians are Arab, they're speaking Arabic, so they have the Arabic culture in common with Muslims. And with the Jews, we have the Bible in common. So I think the Christians are ready to be this kind of bridge. - My father came here in '67, right when the east Jerusalem and west Jerusalem was united, he came right here and he felt it was very important for the Jewish people to establish an institute of learning the Bible, and the Talmud, right here, which is across the Temple Mount, and is really the heart of the world, and the heart of the Jewish people. - Today, since we don't have the third temple, every little thing that hurts a Jewish person's heart, the best place to go and pray to God is in the Kotel. That's where you go and you can take everything out of your heart and ask from Hashem to give and to help the Jewish people. And it's the best place, because it's the closest, it's the closest place where God can hear your prayers. A week before the new year, we come to the Kotel, in early, early morning before the sun rises, and we Daven, what that's called: Where we ask for forgiveness for all of our sins, and when we Daven there on that week, we feel the specialty in the air. People all over the world know that this is the most holy place you have in the world, in Israel, in Jerusalem, and it's here, located right here, next to our house. - No, no, say it. - Over two years ago, we opened the post office. And I love my post office. It's located in the Old City, in the Jewish Quarter. And we have loads of customers in our post office. We have Jewish customers, we have Muslim customers, we have Christians, everybody loves our post office. Tourists come here. We give such good service here. We're quick; everybody loves us. One of the reasons why I love the location of my post office is because we're right across on the Menorah, and every time I come in and out from my post office, I see this golden menorah, of the base of , of the temple, and it reminds me, and I see that the Jewish nation is getting close to time. My name is Fadwa Mousa Afaneh. I'm a mother of nine. I finished my high school studies with my son, 18 years after I get married. I joined the university and recently, I finished my university studies, thank God. I specialized in Islamic education. Now, thank God, I teach Quranic studies, and the rules of reading and learning by heart. Al-Aqsa Mosque is in our eyes, it is in our heart. It's the core of our love and affection. Al-Aqsa means a lot to all of us. We shall defend it with all our resources, and we cannot allow any power to occupy this holy shrine, or desecrate our holy sites. All the conflict today is an outcome of the Jewish occupation of Al-Aqsa Mosque, and of the land of Palestine. And they took over these lands without any right. They came here as refugees, and later became rulers and replaced the owners of this land, while originally we, the Palestinians, owned this land, and it has been ours for thousands and thousands of years. - Here, we're standing next to King David's tomb. This was the city of King David, the City of David, where King David chose to be his capital. Jerusalem, he decided to build the temple. He was the one that built the foundation of the temple. The Jewish people also come here, a lot of them, to cry here, because they know that the one who's going to redeem the Jewish people is the descendants of King David. So King David is the symbol of the rebuilding of the third temple, and that's why we're crying. We're crying to God: send your descendants, and come build the third temple. Quarreling over the centimeters of sanctity in Jerusalem, it's time I think to pause and think: what is the wisdom that God has in making the same spot sacred for everyone? And I really think at this point, after the intifada at Al-Aqsa, the ongoing war, all the death, all the misery, all the unhappiness, all the blood, all the death of the innocents, all the people who've just put under this horrible way of existence, it's time for people to think: God does not work in vain. He has his wisdom, he has his ideas, and we have to understand them. The Temple Mount is not the Dome of the Rock. The problem, the violence, comes from the fact that the two places overlap geographically. The meaning is different. The space is shared. We really have to stop at this point. People have to stop all this, this is my place, that's your place, this is my spot, this is your spot. Suffer it; after all, it's for God. How to deal with it, requires the wisdom of Solomon. But again, we wonder which Solomon, the Jewish one or the Muslim one?
