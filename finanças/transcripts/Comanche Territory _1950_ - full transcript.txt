Drop your rifle. Get your hands up above your head. Well, so you come to thank me stranger? That's one way of putting it but I'm a curious man mister. Before I thank you I'd like to know what you got against me. Why nothing son, nothing at all. Then why did you shooted me instead of the Comanches? I'd call that a mighty fair question. You mind if I put my arm down son? I got a bad shoulder. Just don't go reaching for any iron, eh? Well, you might put it onto the head in the military strategy son. You see Comanches sometimes get queer notions. They figure that land back there is kind of sacred. As long as you was trespassing, you were safe. I was just trying to coax you back onto sacred territory. So that's why they kept changing their minds. I'm afraid I owe you my sincere apology sir and my thanks. Ah, were no real danger, there only ten of them and I still got one good arm left. - Mind if I've a look at this one? - Yeah. This is right friendly of you stranger. Looks as though the Comanches got to you before they got to me. There was no Comanches. Comanches is real friendly people, if you don't rub them the wrong way. Let's just say it's a snake bite. Seems as though the snake left a little bit of lead in there. Only one kind of snake around these parts. - I'll get it out as quick and easy as I can. - There's no hurry son. Only don't throw it away, I like to save the lead folks take out of me... Got me three pounds of it. I reckon that there is supposed to be one of them Bowie knives. - That's exactly what it is. - That is exactly what it ain't. That's the poorest imitation of the genuine article as ever I seen. It is? Yessiree, that one is the same as thousands of others folks are selling back east. A real Bowie knife, that's something else again. I'd ought to know, I gave Jim Bowie the idea for that weapon myself. - Is mighty interesting. - Yessiree, it was back in Louisiana. Me and Jim were sitting on the front porch whipping. Jim was a rich man in them days. It was on account that I'd given him the idea there's plenty of money in sugar. No time at all, Jim had cleaned up three million dollars. Two million. - You a friend of Jim Bowie's? - Not particularly. Well, anyways Jim I says, someday I'm going to fashion me a hunting knife... 16 inches long and curved in the end like a heathen... - Scimitar. - It's right, scimitar. So as my hand won't slip I says, aimed to put cross guard on the hilt... and I'm going to put a double edge on the last three inches. Four inches. Next thing I knowed, Jim Bowie beat me to it and made the knife his self. - I don't think I quite got your name son. - James Bowie of Louisiana. Oh, while you was talking I was beginning to think, James Bowie? Why, I'll be hog swallowed. And whom do I have the pleasure of digging into? Dan'l Seeger, Dan'l Gideon Seeger, ex-hunter, ex-Indian fighter, ex-congressman. And as you have probably figured out, the biggest hogtied, jug-headed... - turnip sucking liar in the whole world. - Steady now Dan'l. I think I got it. I find this mighty interesting Jim, them... bucks out there come galloping by and see how close they can come to us with their arrows and they try again 10 paces further on and so on. It's that so on that bothers me. I wish you were still a member of congress Dan'l. This seems the most appropriate time to register a complaint. I call that mighty fair shooting. You take Shoshones Jim, they're a bit nearsighted for Injuns. Now, if them were Shoshones instead of Comanches I'd be getting a little nervous. How many rounds do these games usually run? Three is about average, four rounds is extra good, if... it should happen to run up to five, well... them bucks would be talking about nothing else for weeks to come. Nice to know. Well, in case they're only playing a three rounder... was mighty nice meeting up with you Jim Bowie. Excuse the left hand Dan'l. It's been a nice friendship, if a short one. Yeah, me unconscious most of the time. Look yonder Jim. It's Quisima, the number one chief. I'd seen him once in Washington. He's the one I came out here to see. - Does he understand English? - I don't know. So this is the mighty Quisima, who sat in the Council of the White Man in Washington. This is Quisima, who gave one hand in friendship to his white brothers... while the other hand held a knife. This is Quisima whose word is shifting as the wind... whose tongue twists like a river of many branches. This is Quisima, breaker of treaties. Today, the Comanche is held in honor and respect... like the mountain that never yield... or the sun that never changes. Tomorrow you will be driven off like a dog... that wanders close to a campfire to take his place among men. White men broke treaty, went where forbidden to go. He's a stranger in these parts. Your men should've come to him friendly like and told him he was... trespassing on sacred ground... instead of swooping down on him like chicken hawks trying to kill him. I come from the Land of the Naches, in the Muscogeean... to sit in council with the mighty Quisima. If I did not come in friendship your three braves would now lie dead. Comanche honors his treaties. Hope my white brothers do same when time comes. One white brother hurt. Comanche medicine man make him well again. Meantime, white man whose tongue... is as sharp as his blade, will teach Quisima... more about this knife. James Bowie, I had your gift of speeching I'd still be in congress. All right Jim, my arm being as good as new, we are pulling out tomorrow. Well Quisima, I've kept my part of the bargain. In the two weeks we've been here, I've taught your men how to make and fight... with my kind of knife. Blade that cuts two ways has kept his word. Quisima will keep his when treaty with white man is renew... Bowie, brother of Quisima, may dig silver ore that lies beneath land of Comanches. And the Comanches will get a good price for it. As long as campfires burn before the tents of Comanches... the blade that cuts two ways and his friends will be welcome. I ain't aiming to pry into your private affairs Jim but... that silver deal you made with Quisima... You're not prying Dan'l. Since the war of 1812, the country is been trying to get back on its feet. We need that silver to help us do it, that's why I came out here. I hate to disappoint you Jim but that treaty ain't being renewed next week. You're mistaken. The renewal was drawn up when I left the east. Oh, was drawn up all right, but Andy Jackson gave it to a dimwit named Dan'l Seeger... - to give to the Comanches for ratification. - Well then, what's wrong? Remember that bullet you took out of me shoulder? Well, a short while before I run into you, I was dragged, dossed and thieved. The ornery skunks took the treaty renewal. But the president can always send the Comanches another copy. Yeah, it'll be weeks before they get here. Meanwhile, folks are pouring into the territory by the dozens. Just waiting for the treaty to expire, comes the deadline, they all will be staking claim. And once they get in here, it ain't going to be as easy to get out of here. Any idea who might've done it? No, but I'm hoping I might find out something when we get to Crooked Tongue. Don't you remember anything? As a matter of fact, there was something Jim. Just before I passed out, I got a whiff of fancy perfume. - Perfume? - Perfume. Smelled real good too. For a minute, I thought I was getting mighty too close to the Pearly Gates. You know what kind it was? No, but I'd recollect it if I ever ran cross it again. I may not have good brains but I sure got a good smeller. Dan'l and I've been doing some tall thinking along the way. Whoever took that treaty knows for certain there'll be no renewal next week. That follows. So naturally, you'll expect to have a lot of silver to sell in the near future. Well, seems logical. Well, I'm going to spread it around town I came out here to buy silver. - All I can lay my hands on. - Now, why couldn't I've thunk of that? The best way to get polecats is to smoke them out. Anybody who's ready to make a deal with you knows more than he had ought to. Precisely. And since you're evidently known by sight I suggest we ride into town alone. As we used to say in congress, the motion is seconded and passed and the meeting is adjourned. Come on, you cow-heels. Now, put your money down. Boozer here will take all bets. Your money or your livestock. But just see that you make it big. With our luck I'm not going to make this ride unless you fellas make it worth my while. Now let me get this straight Katie. You're betting you can take that tray in one hand... - and ride full gallop to the end of town... - Stop dead, ride back at full speed... return the tray and if one of the glasses is spilled, I lost my bet. Katie, you've just made yourself a wager. Do you call that a wager? Take that trash out of my sight, I don't aim to be insulted... by small bets like that. Well, come on some man-sized bets or I'm not going to trouble myself. - All right, there you are. - That's more I like it. - Come on now, come on. - $14, keep going. Come on now, come on. All right. - Come on now, let him do it. - Come on, come on, put your hands over here. - Get away folks. - Go on, hanging right on to it, right? - There, you all set Katie? - All set. Now easy, easy does it. Don't spill it, I got my money on it. - You clumsy ox. - I'm terribly sorry. - Blundering fool. - Now, now miss, I said I was sorry. It's not nice for a lady not to be a lady. Sorry? He said he's sorry. You blundering tin-horn, you made me lose all my bets. Bets? I didn't know ladies made bets. You call me a lady once more and I'll fill you full of lead. Easy now miss, the mood you're in you're liable to pull that trigger... thereby causing a most embarrassing situation for both of us. You did that on purpose. Look mister. If the lady wants to pull a gun on me, that's quite all right. Where I come from we usually let the ladies have their way. But I don't like a man doing it. - No you don't and I'm going to shoot... - You get out of this. But Miss Katie, I bet my whole bankroll on you. I can take care of this, this tin-horn without your help. I've got an idea. Why don't you two toss a coin to see who shoots me, eh? You talk too much. All right mister, draw. I said draw. Sorry ma'am... Back in Louisiana when we meet any pretty ladies, we make love to them... we kiss them... spank them on occasion, but we never go around shooting them. Are you going to draw or aren't you? Of all the yellow, spineless, cowardly coyotes I... Pay off all bets. Another thing I forgot to mention... I dislike the sound of someone cocking a pistol behind my back. - Hello. - Howdy? I'd like to deposit this bank draft and draw some cash against it. Oh, sure, sure. 5,000 dollars? You have to take this up with the boss, in there. It's all right, go right in. Well? Look miss, I'm liable to run out of apologies... if you're following me around to start trouble again. What you want to see me about? Can assure you miss, seeing you was the least of my intentions. I'm waiting to see the president of the bank. All right, start talking. You're not the bank president? Mister, I am the bank and I'm busy. Now, what do you want? I'd like to deposit this draft and draw some cash against it. James Bowie, Louisiana. And now you got the better of me... I usually like to know the names of people I do business with. The name is Kathryn Howard and we're not doing any business. You mean you're, you're not going to honor this draft? That's exactly what I do mean, I don't like the look of it. - Meaning, you don't like me? - Suit yourself. I don't like you mister or your bank draft. But there isn't another bank within 200 miles. I'm considered a fairly wealthy man back east but if... you refuse to cash this draft I might as well be broke. Now, it does seem to work out that way, doesn't it? Thanks for dropping in Mr. Bowie. But this is ridiculous, this is a perfectly legal bank draft. You can't refuse to recognize the Bank of Louisiana. I refuse to recognize the whole State of Louisiana. Miss Howard... I've done a lot of things in my life but I've never had a bank president across my knee for a good spanking, that's a pleasure I shall look forward to. If you refuse to accept this draft... I'm sure the gambling casino next door will be very glad to. Mr. Bowie... Let me give you some friendly advice. Get out of town, you've already been here too long. Very kind of you to want to be my friend, thanks. We must've dinner together sometime. - Jack. - Eight. - Seven. - Four. - Who's in charge around here? Stacey. That's him at the end of the bar. Excuse me, they tell me you're in charge around here. That's right. I'd like to cash a draft drawn on the Bank of Louisiana. - Certainly, how large? - 5,000. You know, that size you have to take it up with the big boss. - And where do I find the big boss? - In the office. Oh, no. It's you again. Get to the point Mister, this happens to be one of my busy days. - Now, what can I do for you? - Oh, I've seen everything. I've no time for small talk Mr. Bowie. But if this is a social call, I... No, not at all Miss Howard, I have in my possession a draft, drawn on the bank... Oh what's the use? Look, I need cash. I'll make you a sporting proposition. I'm not a gambler but evidently you are. One cut of the cards for five thousand. You've made yourself a bet Mr. Bowie, come on. We're breaking in for one hand of high card Slim. That's all boys, pick up your chips. - Give me 5,000. - Five thousand one hand? - You ask too many questions. - Cash, if you don't mind. Mind if I've a look at those cards? - Why you little... - That's all right Slim. Mr. Bowie has a peculiar sense of humor. - Why don't you shuffle them too? - No, it's not necessary. After all we do trust each other, don't we? Ladies first. Oh, I forgot, you don't like to be call a lady or dress like one either. An eight. Four. Your money Mr. Bowie. I believe I mentioned before, I don't gamble Miss Howard. You can have the draft, that'll keep it from being gambling. Now look Mr. Bowie, if that's a bet... I don't think you meant that to be an insult or did you? I never insult anyone with 5,000 dollars, especially a lady. - What will it be? - That'll be all right. Any kind that will do. Jim, I've smelled half the people in town and believe me there are no lilies. I've smelled polecat and sheepherder and about a dozen assorted smells... - I haven't classified as yet. - Any trace of that perfume? Not a whiff but I'll keep on smelling until my smeller gives up. I'm sorry you had trouble with the boss. If she'd known who Jim Bowie was I'm sure she would've been more courteous. I can't imagine that female tiger, if she is a female... being courteous under any circumstances. Oh, Katie is really a nice person Mr. Bowie, when you get to know her better. Getting to know her better is one ordeal I'm hoping to spare myself. - Can I buy you a drink? - Thanks. Boozer. So far, all the friends I've made in this town add up to zero. Well, your entrance into town wasn't exactly conducive to making friends. You know, I spent most of my life in the east. That's where I first heard of Jim Bowie and his fabulous knife. I hear tell he's a deadly man killer. - It's a hunting knife. - Sorry. - You're in sugar, aren't you? - Used to be. We don't grow much sugar in these parts. No, but I understand you're expecting a fine crop of silver very soon. Thinking of staking your claim in Comanche Territory? I'm leaving the claim taking to others. I'm buying silver, all I can get. It's very interesting Mr. Bowie. If I hear of anyone with silver to sell, I'll pass the word along. Well, if it ain't Miss Katie Howard. Lucky for you Lem, I can't tote any guns in this outfit. What are you rigged up for Katie? A wedding or a funeral? Wait until you see the dress I wear the day we bury you. All right boys. When Katie goes feminine, somebody better watch out. - Still wondering if the tiger is female? - Not anymore. - I'm raising 10 more. - No bet. What's the idea? I thought I told you card sharks to keep out of my place, now get. - But I... - Go on. - You mighty affectionate for a man your age. - It ain't affection it's, it's that perfume. If going to affect people like that I'd better not use it anymore. Alright miss, where is the treaty? - Treaty? The treaty with the Comanches, the one you took from me, what you've done with it? I don't know what you talking about. That treaty was a property of the Federal government and I aim to get it back. - I'm sorry Miss Katie. - Why you clumsy mutt. Hey, someone get me out of here, someone get me out of here. I promised myself this pleasure miss bank president. That's for not cashing my draft. I'll kill you when I get out of here. That's for giving me so much trouble. Throw these two gentlemen out of here. - Well, I hope you know what you're doing. - You bet I do. You know, people don't toss Jim Bowie around like that and get away with it. I'll take my chances whoever he is. For your information, he's a very wealthy man. - He's in town to buy silver. - So what? A Comanche silver is no good to us if we don't get someone to take it off our hands. There'll be other buyers. - Sure, maybe in a few months but we can use Jim Bowie now. If you don't want all our plans to fall through, you'd better go after him. See if you can repair the damage you've done. Me go crawling to him? I'd rather die first. I'm not asking you Katie, I'm telling you. It's no use Jim, I'll never learn to keep my mouth shut. I had, I'd still be in Congress. You never struck me as the kind of man that goes around... kissing strange girls in the shoulder. - And in one drink too. - I wasn't kissing, I was whiffing. Instead of saying nothing, playing possum, I had to raise a fuss and get us thrown out. Now, we can't get back in there snoop around. I'm not so sure of that Dan'l. I came out to tell you that I was sorry, I want to apologize. - Well, this is a surprise. - It is to me too, I... I mean, we try to run a respectable place and... if your friend here hadn't started all the trouble... He's no friend of mine, I never saw him before. Well, you were trying to help him. Just a case of helping the underdog too many against one. I reckon I could take the blame for that little fracas miss. You see, I met up with an accident awhile back and I... I've been kind of getting funny spells ever since, you know... imagining all sorts of funny things. I, I'm sorry if I caused you any trouble stranger. I hope we can consider all this a misunderstanding Mr. Bowie. - I'm sure that's all it was Miss Howard. - Oh, that's very kind of you say so. If you're not holding any grudges, I, I'd like to offer you a drink. Well, the offer is gratefully accepted, providing of course I'm still welcome inside. Oh, of course Mr.Bowie. And again, my deepest apologies. Not at all Miss Howard, my apologies to you. Well, I'll be hogs-walled. - How about this table Mr. Bowie? - Splendid. - You can see everything from here. - And nobody can get behind me. Oh, now Mr. Bowie, Boozer... - see that Mr. Bowie has anything he wants. - But Miss Katie, I think he's just a... - You're not paid to think. Mr. Bowie is a guest of mine. Give him the best in the house. Oh, by the way, have you made any arrangements for your lodgings? No, not yet. Well, then it's all settled, you'll stay at my ranch. That's very gracious of you Miss Howard. No, not at all Mr. Bowie. You know, I had no idea Stacey was your brother. You didn't? He told me when I got to know you better I'd get to like you and I believe he was right. So in two days you think you're beginning to know me? At least I'm beginning to like you. Come. I thought the Comanche had a peace treaty with his white brothers. Come. Seems that's his entire vocabulary, I think we'd better go with him. Why are we brought here like this? Quisima breaks his word to keep the peace with the white man. Quisima keeps his word. Want to know if white men will keep theirs. A blade that cuts two ways will sit in council of Comanches. Pakanah... This Pakanah, my son, he lived with white man. He tell you when your tongue message is given to us. White man like bird that makes sweet music but rob nest of others. He promised Comanche peace... while hand reaches for a gun to slay him. Every day, we see white man... come across plain from direction of morning sun. He bring tools with him, not for planting of corn but for digging of silver. White man plan to betray Comanche. He will take this land. There will be no new treaty. Each day Comanche wait white man becomes stronger. Comanche must strike, at once Tonight. Council agrees with Pakanah. But I told them... My brother Bowie, man of honor. He not lie. If he tell me white man renew treaty... Quisima believe him. - What do you think Miss Howard? - I, I don't know. I pledge my word of honor Quisima... that the treaty is already been renewed and is been sent on its way here from Washington. White man has false tongue. I don't blame you for being angry Pakanah but I don't like to be called a liar. White man lie, I make him admit. If that's the way you want it. Not with your weapons, with ours. Each to his own. Please don't, you won't stand a chance. Then why don't you stop it? You know there's a new treaty and you know who took it. I can't. Then I've got to fight him. Or every Comanche in the territory will be on the warpath before morning. Wish you'd change your mind Pakanah. - I don't want to kill you. - I want kill you. I told the truth, I told the truth. White man tell truth. You think I want that silver for myself, don't you? Well, you're wrong. I have my reasons, good reasons, but they wouldn't mean anything to you. - Maybe they would. - Not to an Easterner. You would've to be a part of that to understand... and that would've to be a part of you. My father and grandfather came out here to... tray and make something out of that wilderness and they died trying. They brought all their friends with them and everyone who listen. Go on. But things didn't work out the way they expected them. They raised cattle... but there was no way to get them to the eastern markets. People began to get discouraged. Lately things have been getting worse. A lot of families have left the territory and gone back. And you think that Comanche silver will keep them from leaving, is that it? Yes, that's it. Once they stake claims, they have to stay here. And no one, the Indians and the federal government included, is going to stop us. That's mighty big talk Miss Howard. Well, that's the way we feel about, all of us, even my brother Stacey. Of all the upside down, back into, mule-headed... illogical, irrational feminine reasoning. You saw the mood those Comanches are in. Do you think for one moment the shooting stop... with that one rifle ball I took out of Dan'l Seeger's shoulder? I'm sorry about that. There wasn't supposed to be a shooting, the men with me were pretty desperate. Somebody slipped up. And they'll slip up again if they try to jump Indian land. Quisima is already given the government permission to dig for their silver. That's mighty fine for the government but it doesn't do us any good. Listen Miss Howard, your desire to improve this territory is most commendable... but you going about it in the wrong way. Don't you understand? The country needs this silver. They'll make a road out here. Wagon trains will be rolling in and out of here. People who left will be coming back and hundreds more. Besides, this territory will be bigger than anything your... father or grandfather ever dreamed of. - You really believe that? - Believe that? I know it. So you're calling off the deal Katie? - All our plans, everything we've worked for? - Not until you agree Stacey, After all, that's your problem as much as mine. Oh, anything you say is all right with me, you know that. Since we only have three days left, I suggest we get... the treaty to Quisima as quickly as possible. I didn't know there be a change in plans. I destroyed it, I'm sorry. No, no harm done, you two confess the word out that there is a new treaty... and nobody is to try moving in on the Comanches. That will protect us till Andrew Jackson can send along a new copy. I'm afraid that won't work Jim. Lot of newcomers pulled up stakes and came out here just to get in on the silver rush. They're not going to be in a listening mood. I found out when I was in business back East that usually the best... way to handle a stubborn customer was to get a couple of drinks... and a good meal under his belt, then he'd usually listen to reason. We're going to throw the biggest shindig this territory is ever known. We throw the cafe wide open and wine them and dine them until they're ready to listen. And just in case a few of them don't see the light... I suggest we take their guns away before they come in. What's the matter Tom? Comanches making trouble? Heck no, get down to Crooked Tongue today, free fills and plenty of liquor. Katie Howard is throwing a shindig, you better hurry. Yeah? I guess I better get home and change my duds. Come on. Hey, stop everything. Katie Howard is throwing a party. Free fills and liquor for everybody. - You sure there ain't no charge for this? - Everything is free. Well, in that case, thanks. Here now, we don't have none of that. I like your neighbors Katie, they're nice friendly people. I sure hope they stay that way after we bust the news to them. Well, I don't expect any trouble with the old timers... but there's a lot of newcomers around here that I've never seen before. - Hello Jed. - Oh, excuse me. - Hello Sue, hello Jed. - Hello. - I'm sure glad you could've make it. - I wouldn't miss this on a bet Katie. What's all this all here? Oh sorry Jed, everyone is checking their guns. Fair enough. - Sure is a pretty girl. - Sure is. Too bad she's always wearing buckskin keeping her figure cover. At your age Dan'l, you shouldn't be looking. I ain't seen much else to do. We just talking about you Miss Katie. Jim here was saying if I'd help... keep an eye on the weapons, he'd sure like to ask you for a dance. - And what did you say Mr. Seeger? - I said I'd be delighted. On the contrary Mr. Seeger, I'd be delighted. ♪ Follow me, my bonny lad, for I'll not follow you ♪ Come on Katie, don't be bashful.

Well, nobody is taking my gun. - Well then, you can't go in. - Why don't you try to stop us? - I got that one from the Iroquois. The Iroquois taught me that one. I better tell them now, I'll take a couple of these. This is as good a time as any to make a little announcement. There's a new treaty with the Comanches and it'll be here from Washington in a few days. That means that you can all forget that midnight deadline tomorrow. Nobody is moving in on Comanche territory, nobody. You can do whatever you like lady, I'm moving in. If any of you newcomers feel like arguing, I got a couple of good arguments right here. You old timers know how my folks felt about this territory... and how I feel about it and I'm not going to let it break up. That silver is going to be mine but it'll be done legally. And there'll be plenty of work for everybody and a chance to live right... and bring your kids up in the same way. This territory is going to grow faster and bigger than we ever dreamed. Those that feel like I do will do well to stay. And as for the others, well... we'll stake them to the expenses of their trip back home. - I'm staying Katie. - You count on me too. What about the rest of you? Katie, I'm afraid I've got some bad news. I was up on the north range checking the cattle and... I found a couple of fresh carcasses and some wolf tracks. Wolves? Yeah, traveling in a pack, about a dozen of them as near as I can make out. I've never heard of wolves traveling in packs this far South. - They're heading towards Timberline. - Oh, I got my stock grazing up there. I better get my rifle and get going. - I'll go with you. - Just a minute boys, you need help. Folks, as part of these festivities, I'm organizing a wolf hunt. I'll pay $20 in gold for every pelt you bring back. Well Jim, you sure you won't change your mind and come with us? No, I better stay and keep an eye on the party. Might pretty party to keep an eye on. What about you Stacey? Oh, I'd have trouble getting on a horse, let alone, riding one. Well, I'm thinking on four pelts, one for each of us. Let's go. Well, I guess everybody is here except the boss. It's only a wild turkey. We got a long day ahead of us, they make mighty good eating. Here he comes. You all know what we're here for. I had you men picked because I think you all feel the way I do. We didn't come out here for the good of the glorious West, but for our own good. That being so, we are moving in on Comanche territory tonight. - Are there any questions? - Yeah. Suppose the federal government brings troops in here to throw us out. Won't be any law in this territory for 25 years. By that time, we'll all be rich enough not to have to worry. You've been talking mighty big about how we're all going to get rich... but you ain't never mentioned how we're going to split up the silver. I'll let you know that after we take over and start digging it. I'd like to know right now. Are there any other troublemakers hankering to know how we split up? This ain't no argument Stacey, What are the Comanches going to be doing while we're digging the silver? That's all taken care off. Comanches without rifles shouldn't present much of a problem. I've got the original treaty right here... with, shall we say a little added clause. Clause 10... this treaty of peace to take effect only on the condition that said Comanche Indians... shall immediately as a token of their intention of keeping said peace... surrender all guns, rifles and powder in their possessions. Well, there it is Quisima, all signed and sealed. This trick of white man, Comanche must not give up gun. Long before white man came... Comanche hunted with bow and knife was happy. White man's gun has brought them only sorrow, bloodshed. Since we will now live in peace with white brothers... we not need these guns. It shall be as white brother's wish. Sorry you had to leave so soon. Got to get the youngsters home and straightened out, they act too much. Sure was a swell shindig Miss Howard. That cake was every bit as good as mom's. Almost. - Bye, bye. - Bye, bye. Well, it looks like your party is a success in more ways than one. Thanks to you, it was really your idea. Folks took the change in plans very nicely. I'm sure you won't have any trouble. And someday soon, I'll be coming through this way again. And this territory will be booming. - You're not leaving. - In a couple of days. I want to get down there and find out what it's all about. When you expect to get back? I'd be more up to hurry if I knew I was being missed. In that case Jim Bowie, you'd better hurry. I'm going to miss you too. Oh, what's the matter Dan'l? Didn't you get any wolves? I found plenty of wolves, two legged wolves. Jim Bowie, you and me have been took in like a couple of first class greenhorns. Meaning what? Meaning if there's a wolf pack in them hills, I'll eat my saddle. Looks like Miss Howard and her brother dealt it to us right off the bottom of the deck. I hope you know what you're talking about Mr. Seeger because I don't. No, I suppose you don't know where your brother is or what he is up to. Of course I do, he took the buckboard back to the ranch. Now you can just stop your playacting young woman. Stacey and most of those men are up in the hills in that supposed to be wolf hunt. And they are aiming to move in on the Comanches. Well, that's not true. Naturally, she don't know nothing about it. Just like she don't know her brother rides like a range hand... and he's mighty handy in a lot of other ways. Jim, I don't know anything about this, I swear it. I got to hand it to you Miss Howard, that wolf hunt was a stroke of genius. You've got to believe me, Jim. You picked a clever way of getting the guns back to the men and sneaking them out... - without arousing suspicion. - Jim, you've got to listen to me. I've listened enough. Let's go. Boozer, I want to see you in the office. - I'm kind of busy out there Miss Katie. - Get over there. - Where's Stacey? - I don't know. I guess he went home. - You know where he is and what he's up to. - No ma'am. I don't know nothing. Then, you better start guessing. Stay right where you are and don't move. What is this, a joke? Listen, Boozer... I've talked big and tough all of my life but I've never shot anyone. You'd better start talk. But if I talk, Stacey will kill me. You can worry about that later, if you don't talk, I'll kill you. We got here as fast as we could. We do not want Quisima to think it is the white... man's government that betrays the Comanche. Our brother Bowie spoken well, Quisima understand is great problem. The boys still got a few hours before sundown, plenty of time to get ready... for that pack of human hyenas. Comanches have given up their guns, they've only arrows and lances and few knives. My brother Bowie made for them. They'll never let you get close enough to use them. Well, they pick you off like a herd of buffalo. If Comanches must die... they will die like men, but never gave up... sacred soil of their fathers. Listen Quisima, dying may be all right for your men... but you got to get your women and children out of here. Let them take what they can carry and hide out in the hills... then spread your men out., let them fight from behind rocks and trees. Caution your braves again. We'll wait beyond the village until Stacey's men come close on this mountain. Then we'll attack. Well Stacey, the men are rested and fed and raring to go. Well, you can pass out some whiskey, no more than two drinks per man. You're quite a ways from home, aren't you sis? - I had to see for myself. - Well, now you know. You're not thinking of whipping your naughty brother. Quite an arsenal you've got over there. - You're not taking any chances. - Can't afford to. Comanches are most cooperative. They gave up their guns without a struggle. You've been planning this for a long time. Even before I come out here. I suppose I'd be wasting my breath if I tried to talk you out of it. Just as much as if I tried to talk you into coming in... with me and giving up that nonsense about building up the West. Very well Stacey, now we know where we stand. From now on, I'm on the other side of the fence. Fortunes of war Katie. Where you going? Out of here, if I don't get a bullet in my back. Take some men and go after her. We're not waiting any longer, we're moving in on the Comanches right now. I don't know how I'm going to make out with your kind of knife Jim. I was practically weaned on this Arkansas toothpick. Remember, it cuts up as well as down. This not white man's fight, you go. We like it here Pakanah. Besides, we've got to make things right on account of what Stacey is doing. It's fellas like him that gives a white man a bad name. Once in anger, I want kill my brother Bowie. Now, if you let me... I want fight beside him. Glad to have you. Well, won't have to wait long to get his wish, here they come. - They won't get their guns back. Tell them to save their arrows. You know what feels to be a turkey in a turkey shoot. Well, they can't hold much longer. Maybe if I try to ration them. You think so, eh? Look. They won't get their guns back, eh? Quick, rifles. Don't get them untied along, let's go. I ought to turn you over to The Comanches... but you'll be a lot safer with the Federal government. As soon as I finish my business with Mr. Houston, I'll be back. Hurry Jim... - I'll need a lot more help now. - Looking like that, you do all right. - Well, goodbye Kate. - Bye Jim, good luck.. That ain't no way to say goodbye to a gal, you big galoot. Go ahead and kiss her.
