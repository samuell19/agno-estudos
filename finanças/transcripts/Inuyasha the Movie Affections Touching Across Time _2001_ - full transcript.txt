What do you want? Lord Sesshomaru... We shall have your fang. Fang? That isn't the one. That sword has no feeling of destruction. Go and find the right one. The powerful sword which can break this seal... Tetsusaiga. Gramps! Breakfast! Gramps, breakfast! Oh, Sota! Look! The flower buds are growing! l see them! They're amazing! lt's been 500 years since this sacred tree bloomed! Now then, Sota, the origin of this sacred tree is... Kagome, your soup will get cold. Mom, where's the sugar? By the window. Oh, here. You sure you don't need any help? Nope. Omelet is my specialty. Don't overheat the frying pan. l know! l know! Shucks! Forgot to oil the pan! Until then, the ancient sacred tree would blossom every year at this time. However, after this evil half-demon was sealed to the tree, not once have there been flowers. How's that? Learned something? So the flowers bloom again... because l released lnuyasha from the seal? Ow! Hurray for me! Done! Looks delicious! Doesn't it? You're terrific, Sis! Can't have any. Stingy! Sota, you're becoming a nusisance lately! My name is Kagome Higurashi. Until just recently, l was an average ninth-grader. But l discovered that l could travel back in time 500 years... through the ancient well in this shrine. What is that? l'm positive that it's a poisonous insect from the Mainland known as a scorpion. What's it doing here? Who cares! As long as l know that it possesses a Sacred Jewel Shard! Don't be rash, lnuyasha! l warned you. Reckless as usual. Kirara, let's go! 'Kay! Me too! l'm just a little kid. What the heck! The Feudal Era is full of monsters and demons. lt was during this period that lnuyasha was bound to the sacred tree. Oh... lnuyasha's father was a demon and his mother was human, making him a half-demon. He's rough and spoiled and ill-tempered... and gets SO jealous! He's hopeless! Well, he does have a few redeeming qualities. lnuyasha was looking for the Sacred Jewel of the Four Souls. But Priestess Kikyo sealed him to this tree fifty years ago. They had been very close until something tore them apart... But that's a separate story. The Sacred Jewel of the Four Souls is able to... increase the power of demon creatures. l'm to blame that it was shattered into hundreds of fragments. That's why lnuyasha and l are collecting the Jewel Shards. We have some very dependable friends. Help! A fox demon child named Shippo who uses Fox Magic. Hiraikotsu! An amazingly strong Demon Slayer named Sango. Sango! And notoriously flirtatious Monk Miroku, who has a Wind Tunnel in his palm which can suck up everything. You're not hurt? Thank you, Miroku. You saved...me! Keep your hands to yourself! lt's not what you think! l was just making sure that Your flawless skin wasn't harmed. Don't bother! And also, Sango's reliable companion, Kirara. Oh yes. l forgot one more. Old Myoga, the Flea Demon. He's very knowledgeable, but... Huh? Kagome! Hey! Smushed! Kagome! What have you been doing? Master lnuyasha is already in battle. Which means, Myoga, You ran away again. Huh? Fool! l just came to get you since you were so slow! You're always the first to disappear when danger strikes. Why you! Are you all right, lnuyasha?! l just can't get into the swing of it! You are hopeless when Kagome isn't around! Say that again! lnuyasha! Everyone! Kagome! Kagome! Kagome! What've you been doin'?! l got delayed making bento lunches. Hah! This isn't a picnic! That's a woman for you! l apologized! That's right! --Are you all right? --l'm okay. Kagome, where's the Jewel Shard? Umm... l see it! On its tail! At the tip. Awright! Hiraikotsu! Take this! Tetsusaiga! You did it! Kagome! Leave the rest to me. Wind Tunnel! We did it! Oh dear... What're you doing? Hurry and get the Jewel Shard. But... Weakling! Thank goodness! You're amazing, Kagome. The demonic aura has been purified. Finally found it! --Ruri. --Yes? --Hari. --Yes? The time has come. We are ready. Now then... l made special lunches for us today. Hey, that's wonderful! How fortunate! Eating your home-cooking in such a place. Hmm... Never seen some of this stuff before. ls it edible? How rude! Eat and find out! Kagome! This octopus has only four legs! And it has no face. That's a weiner. This rice ball is good. That's because Kagome puts such care into her cooking. We must partake of everything with gratitude. Huh? We haven't had anything decent lately. How is that omelet? lt's my specialty. Will you shut up? Now, now! Don't be so mean to one so little. Happy, Shippo? l like this octopus. Well, how was it? Huh? Did it taste good? By the way, didn't you bring that? "That"? What do you mean? That! Oh, here it is! Kagome! Let's boil some water. lnuyasha... Sit! Sit! Sit! Sit! Sit! Sit! Sit! Sit! Sit! S-l-T!!! Just forget it! That's the most intense "sit" l've heard yet. Punishment for not considering Kagome's feelings. What's the matter, Kirara? She's burning with fever. lt must be the toxin from the giant scorpion. Let me see. l'll suck out the poison. Kirara! Wait! Kirara's acting strange. l'll follow Sango. That Sango... l can't believe she carries this with her all the time. They're so restless. l'll say. That stupid lnuyasha! l'll NEVER make him lunch ever again! Jeez... Nothing good is happening to me today. Kirara? Kirara! She's... Yours, right? She's reacting to insect poison. We just gave her an antidote. Thank you, l appreciate it. Not at all. We're glad to be of help. l thank you, too. By the way, l have a request of you. Will you bear my child? Pardon me. l can't help myself when l see pretty women. 'Nough said! Are you from the Continent? Yes, that's very observant of you. And yet, you seem to speak our language very fluently. l suppose so. After all, we came to this land... Over 200 years ago. Kirara! Just what are you doing?! Scorpions? Then the giant scorpion this morning was... l was the one who sent it. Everything went according to our plan. Then it was a set-up? Sango! Why you--! l was waiting for you to use that power. What?! lt's useless. You cannot escape my "duplication." Duplication? Miroku! That woman! Just what did she do? lt's in my possession now. Your Wind Tunnel! Well? How does it feel to be sucked in? Something's interfered. But our business is done. Let's go. Kirara! Kirara? Kirara! What's the matter?! Don't you recognize me? Kirara?! We're taking her. Damn! lt seems Kirara is under their spell. We can't let them do this. Are you two all right? Did you shoot that arrow, Lady Kaede? There was a restlessness in the trees, so l came. You came in the nick of time. l'm so grateful. Are you going after those two? Yes. They headed west. ln the direction of the Forest of No Return. You must use utmost care. Restlessness in the trees signifies that a disaster is about to occur. Or, that something is already afoot. ln any case... Huh? No one's listening? lt's sensing an impending danger. A big calamity is looming. ls it after lnuyasha? Oh dear... What'll l say? "Mom, my bike broke. Can you buy me a new one?" No way she would. Huh? Kikyo? lnuyasha... Huh?! Cripes! Why am l hiding? What a fool! Wait lnuyasha! Where are you going?! Damn that Kagome! l'm gonna give her a piece of my mind! Yeah right! She's got you wrapped around her fingers. Kikyo's soul collectors! Master lnuyasha! What's wrong? Huh? Oh, nooo... ! Hey lnuyasha! You must cherish your elders! That's what Pa always told me. You two! Do not follow me! Hey! lnuyasha! What's with him? Curse of the octopus. The sacred tree... This is where l first met lnuyasha. And it's where Kikyo and lnuyasha parted. But... Actually, they were drawn to each other. Kikyo still loves lnuyasha. Ooh! l have to get back soon! Huh? What's this? Oww! What am l doing?! l should've just gone home. l'm here in this age... to gather the pieces of the Sacred Jewel and restore it to its original shape. But Kikyo can also find the Shards. The reason why l stay here is... lnuyasha! Silly! You cut yourself? lf Old Myoga were here now, he'd be real happy. Huh?! What is it? My favorite handkerchief! lt's just a piece of cloth. Anyways, are you alone? What do you mean? Err...nothing. You came to look for Kikyo, right? So you did follow Kikyo's scent! Will you shut up?! There! lt's done. Let's go! No matter how far apart they are, they still care about each other. There's no place for me. l knew that. Human-eating moths?! What're all these moths?! How creepy! Kagome! Hold your breath or else you'll faint. For how long?! Until l get rid of them. What else?! lron-reaver, soul-stealer! There's no end to this! Damn, l'll get them all at once. What's that?! lnuyasha? l don't know who you are! My name is Menomaru. lnuyasha... Receive the baptism of my sword! Good! That blade is the fang of destruction! What? Will you quit talking nonsense?! Are you all right? l can't hold it anymore... Fool! How wasteful to use it to protect a human. l will make it worth its while. Now, hand it over! Quit joking! He deflected my Tetsusaiga! l have to finish him off quickly or Kagome's in trouble. lron-reaver, soul-stealer! Damn! My vision's getting blurred! Damn... l can't move! How hopeless. Losing consciousness so soon? lnuyasha... l'm going to test the cutting edge of this fang of destruction on you. A barrier? Of all the luck... You're the only one who can wield it? Maybe l can use that girl... Don't move, lnuyasha! We just tended to your wounds. What if you open them up again? These're mere scratches! Where is he? He? The one called Menomaru... that disgusting demon! Menomaru? Are you sure about that? Where are Sango and Miroku, anyway? And jeez, Kagome is gone, too. That guy...! He took Kagome. What?! Kagome didn't go back to the world beyond the well? Kagome wouldn't go home without first telling me! How disappointing! Can't you even look after your girl properly?! Shaddup! Hey, l'm the one who tended to Your wounds! l don't consider these wounds! Master lnuyasha! You're sure this demon called himself Menomaru? Yeah, no mistake about it! You know him? Menomaru is the only son of Hyoga, an infamous demon from the continent. Demon from the continent? Exactly! 200 years ago, a huge Mongol army from the continent began an attack. And demons and monsters came to this nation... to snatch the souls of those killed in battle. At that time, your father ruled the regions of the West. Hyoga and your father battled ferociously, calling forth thunder and winds and causing a terrible, violent storm. Using one of his fangs, Your father sealed Hyoga and thus, l understand, chased the foreign demons back to the continent. So you didn't witness it personally? Err... Well... Guess you ran away from danger even then. Well, your father...and you... are always so reckless. Where was this Hyoga put under seal? Well, l've heard that before. Where?! The Tree of Ages in the Forest of No Return. The Tree of Ages? Hey lnuyasha! Wait! Don't leave me behind! Lord Menomaru! How did it go? As you can see. That girl? My bait to lure him here. lnuyasha is coming here? The fang of destruction has a barrier. Then... Only he can wield it. Unless the seal around this fang is broken, the succession ceremony cannot be held. And lnuyasha's Tetsusaiga is necessary for that purpose. However, will a mortal girl like her be bait enough? He will come. That family likes humans. lnuyasha's father fell in love with a mortal woman. And lnuyasha, in whom flows human blood, has fallen in love with yet another mortal. Such eccentrics they are. --Hari! --Yes? Take over this girl. Huh? l have an amusing idea of how to get rid of that half-demon. l understand. Huh? What's the matter, Hari? This girl possesses unusually strong spiritual powers. Could she be a priestess? lmpossible. Look at the odd way she's dressed. Try using this. A Sacred Jewel Shard? Are you sure? One with true power has no need of such a thing. What is this?! This girl! She easily broke the roots holding her! lt seems that she does possess spiritual powers. Who are you?! Where is lnuyasha?! Do not worry. He will be here shortly. What do you intend to do with me?! Kirara...?! What did you do to Kirara? She belongs to us now. Huh?! Return Kirara back to normal! You're a feisty one. l'm serious! My friends, keep this girl company. Hiraikotsu! Sango! Miroku! Kagome! Not only Kirara... but you too, Kagome?! l don't know what you're scheming... ...but we're taking these two back! Kirara! She doesn't want to return to you. Sango! l'm your opponent! l told you l'm serious! l won't miss the next shot. Young girl... You're bait, so act like bait. What bait?! He's fast! Kagome! Duck! lnuyasha! Take this! l was tired of waiting, lnuyasha. Oh yeah? l'm taking Kagome back. lnuyasha! lnuyasha! Kirara! Kirara! Something's wrong! Kagome, move away! Where are you aiming? l did it! What the--?! Damn it! What's going on?! l am immortal. Master lnuyasha! Menomaru absorbs demon power from Hyoga who stands behind him. Hyoga? That one? Hyoga's physical self perished long ago. But his near-limitless power lies sealed inside. Old Myoga, is it? lt's unusual for you to stay. Silence! l can't wait to get away! Master lnuyasha, hurry and untie this thread! After you tell me how to beat this guy! Be reasonable! lt's useless! You cannot defeat me. Demon power of whatever... l just hafta beat the hell outta you, right? lnteresting. Try it. Something's wrong. Be careful, lnuyasha! Don't take me lightly! No, you must stop, Master lnuyasha! Wind Scar! No! Yes! This is the moment l've waited for! l did it! The seal has been broken! What?! lt's collapsing! Hurry and get away! Yeah! lnuyasha! Kagome! Are you all right, Kagome?! Uh-huh... But Sango and Miroku are... l'm here. Everyone accounted for? l must thank you, lnuyasha! What?! My father, Hyoga, lost to your father in battle... and was put under seal at this spot. The fang your brother Sesshomaru wields... does not have the power to break the seal. The one that does have the power is the one left to you, named Tetsusaiga! Tetsusaiga? You...you used me! Now...l can take over everything from my family! What's this?! That is the succession ceremony of the Hyoga clan. Succession ceremony? Menomaru is able to possess the power of his father and transform into a demon even more powerful. Our new Lord Hyoga! Our new lord and master! lt's the end. Menomaru has absorbed the demon power... and become the new Hyoga. No one can defeat him now. Hah! My father beat him, didn't he? Each generation of Hyogas absorbs the power of the previous one... and increases in strength. Menomaru...rather the new Hyoga, is much more powerful than the one your father defeated. From this point on, in order to transform into other giant demon, he will... Who cares! lnuyasha! l just hafta beat this guy, right?! Please...untie this string! Take this! Half-demon! l will never allow a lowlife like you to touch me! Please stop...! Don't die so soon, half-demon. l've made special arrangements regarding your death. What're you saying?! l'll bet you're just scared to fight me! Now come on out! You talk like you mean it. Hey, Myoga! Can't you remember anything? Like his weakness or a way to kill him?! lf you don't wanna die, hurry and remember! You still don't get it? How strong l am?! Huh?! This is in your honor! Disappear completely from the face of the earth! Gather round! All who worship me! Bring to me every soul of every living thing! W-What--! What is it? Mommy! Look! How creepy! Mommy! What is it? l'm scared! The Tree of Ages...! What is going on?! Something's coming! So many! Looks like bugs! Oh no! Lady Kaede! Just what is going on? Old Kaede... Kagome! Kagome! Kagome!! Rin, stay away. Yes! Lord Sesshomaru, do not bother with this. l, Jaken, shall take care of it. Witness the power of the Staff of Two Heads! lt's a hundred years too soon to confront Lord Sesshomaru. W-What--?! l can't see in front of me! lt's too dark! l can't see...! Lord Sesshomaru, You're amazing! Hyoga has been resurrected. You did it, Lord Sesshomaru! No, don't leave me! Lord Sesshomaru! How mean you are to Jaken! Are you okay, Miroku? Hyoga is absorbing the souls of every living thing around. We must maintain constant vigilance and be strong, or we'll become his prey. Well whatever, he's just too strong. You all admit that this time, Your hands're tied. l'm going. l won't leave Kirara like that. l'm coming, too. l can't stand by while my Wind Tunnel is used for evil. lt's hopeless, you two! Some good will come of this. We'll do something. Well, if you insist, l won't try to stop you. But it's gonna take much more to climb... that huge Tree of Ages... Huh? Huh?! No! Give me a break, Miroku! Do you want to be sucked in?! Awright! Awright! Crooked monk! What's the sense of transforming in this small space?! l'll really suck you up! Damn... This stupid injury! Master lnuyasha... lt's dangerous here. Let us return to the West and recoup our strength. Running away? The Hyoga Clan have spent the last 200 years... planning to take revenge. ln order to stand up to them, we need just as much time. Please wait until you're just as powerful as your father was. Shaddup! l'm impatient! But...! No buts! l'm going back! lmpossible! Master lnuyasha! Quiet! No...! W-Whaa--?! You bother me! Just go away somewhere! l'm going alone! No! l will not allow this! l will stop you even if it kills me! lf you insist, Master lnuyasha... do it over my dead body! Master lnuyasha! lnuyasha... ls your persistence a human trait? Then l'll have some amusement at your expense. What's wrong, Kagome? Water... My head hurts... l feel sick... Kagome? Kagome! What's the matter? --Kagome! --No! l can't control myself! Get away! Old Kaede! Kikyo? Kagome! --you're all right! you're not hurt! --lnuyasha! Get away! Please! You look so pale. Go back to Kaede and rest. Kagome? Sorry... l was right there, yet... lnuyasha... Get away... Huh? K-Kagome! lnuyasha! Someone's manipulating her! Damn! ls it that guy?! lnuyasha! Please! Get away! Snap out of it, Kagome! Die! lnuyasha! How long can you keep running, lnuyasha? Damn! What'm l gonna do?! Making Kagome do this! Damn that Menomaru! He won't get away with this! Am l imagining it? Or is the circle getting bigger? The souls he's devoured have made him bigger. ls he a growing boy? Hope he doesn't grow too much. Kirara... l promise to get you back. Kikyo! This is just like the last time. No, that's not Kikyo. lt's Kagome! lnuyasha! Please! Get away from me! --Run! --Do it! Run! Deliver the final blow! Run! Die, lnuyasha! Hiraikotsu! Humans... Well then, Miroku... Sango... Hang in there. l'm impressed that Hachi brought us this far, in this miasma. Miroku... Sango... Why are you stroking my hand? This may be the last moment of our lives. Stop uttering such nonsense! Coming here knowing it's hopeless... Humans are such strange creatures. l wonder about that? lnuyasha! Get away! Please! My body won't listen...to me. Like this... Like this... l'll end up... Damn! Cut it out! l'm sick of hearing You and everyone else... telling me to get away! l'm not running away! l refuse to leave you behind! Wind Tunnel! Wind Tunnel! l'll be your opponent! Petty interference... That sound again... Damn...moth poison. lnuyasha... No... No...! No! Nooo!! Kagome... lnuyasha! lnuyasha! ! lnuyasha... lnuyasha! lnuyasha! Wake up! Open your eyes! lnuyasha, l'm sorry! l'm so sorry! Serves you right. Kikyo... The situation... This spot... You are just my reincarnation. Walking the same path l did. Now, take this and return to your world. No! You never belonged to this era. You are a foreigner... who chanced upon this world of ours. But l can't leave lnuyasha. You are the one who injured lnuyasha! Heed my words... Hyoga is using the formidable Tree of Ages... in order to increase his demon powers. Tree of Ages? Yes, this is also a Tree of Ages. This sacred tree? The Tree of Ages lives through different times. Hyoga's Tree of Ages steals energy from various generations... and matures. By now, other generations of time have frozen over. Your time is going through a never-ending winter now. Oh dear... lt's suddenly gotten so cold. Huh? The flowers! After they finally bloomed! lt's sprouting... On a well this ancient? This well was constructed out of wood from the Tree of Ages. However, its life force which lay dormant... is being awakened by the powerful Tree of Ages. lf the well is covered over, You will never be able to pass through. Before that happens, go back to your own time. But lnuyasha is... Go home! To your own time! You and lnuyasha will never cross paths again! Go home! Never cross paths again... Nor can l, a dead woman whose time has stopped. That girl broke my control... --The tree is dying! --Stop Gramps! Stop the falling snow...! lf we pray, will it go back to normal? lt will! This is the sacred tree which has protected this shrine! our prayers are sure to be answered! Now Sota, pray! Stop the falling snow! Sis! Kagome! Sis! Kagome... The sacred tree...! lnuyasha! lnuyash-- My hands can't touch him anymore. My voice won't reach him anymore. l can't see lnuyasha...anymore! Sis! Sis? What's wrong, Kagome? Monk! You're pretty handsome. Makes me want to dig out your heart and eat it! Kirara! Kirara! Kirara! Snap out of it! lt's useless. She cannot hear your voice anymore. A human and a demon... were never destined to understand each other. You're lnuyasha's older brother... You must really hate her... that girl named Kagome. Or are you just testing her powers? l hate everything. l hate every living thing that depends on the flow of time. As you please. However, l will be the one to destroy lnuyasha. Lord Sesshomaru... is it wise to let that woman live? Jaken, are you blind? That woman is dead. --Huh?! --What does that mean? She was moving. What does it mean, Lord Sesshomaru? Silence, Rin! l'm not asking you, Master Jaken! What?! You brazen child! Wait, Lord Sesshomaru! lt's a lie! The Kagome who saved me would never do such a thing! Kagome's eyes were glazed over with evil. That was NOT our Kagome. Perhaps she's under the same spell as Kirara. l have a bad premonition. We must hurry to the sacred tree! You can at least stand on your own feet! Be kind to an elderly woman and an injured one! She's right! --Hurry, cow! --l'm a horse! This is--! l'm done for! What is that?! The well is covered! This is bad! The Tree of Ages is going berserk! Berserk? Maybe that huge Tree of Ages is calling out to it. This world will be swallowed up if it's left unchecked...! Master lnuyasha! Master lnuyasha! Now then, Monk.... Let's settle this. Your Wind Tunnel versus mine. We'll see who gets sucked in first. Wind Tunnel! Stop this falling snow... Oh, Kagome! You're back? Welcome home. Mom, you took so long! Sorry! Mom... Thank you, Gramps. How is the sacred tree? Do not worry. Leave it to me! Yes. Put this over Gramps. 'Kay! Hang in there, Gramps! Yes! Stop this falling snow... Mom... Maybe this is too light. l'll get a coat. Kagome? Mom, is this tree that important? Yes. This tree holds all our memories. Our memories? The time when Kagome was born. When you were born. When you entered school. When you took first place at the school race. When you were in bed with a high fever. Happy times and sad times. This tree lived through it with us. lt has always protected us. Even for me, this sacred tree... lnuyasha! This is my precious spot. --Huh? --What's the matter? The Sacred Jewel Shard is glowing. Sacred Jewel Shard? As in Sacred Jewel of the Four souls?! l'm still connected... ...to that world! l've never kept the Wind Tunnel exposed for this long. l'm reaching my limit! Prepare to die, Monk! lt's my victory! Lord Hyoga... ! l will end up like that in time. My body...my bones... everything will disappear into the void. You just don't get it, do you? Demons are born to be controlled. And the best way is with power. No! My bond with Kirara is not like that! So foolish! Still so na?ve. Let's hurry and end it. Kirara! l'm not the only one in pain, right? What's wrong, Kirara? Deliver the final blow! Kirara... Kirara! Stop! Kirara! My spell...! Kirara! l knew you wanted to come back! l have no use for you anymore! Kirara! Hiraikotsu! Let's go, Kirara! We did it! Don't think it's so easy to kill me. Lord Hyoga... ! l can still fight...! Let's go, Kirara. Just a bit more. Just a few more souls and l will be complete! So Old Myoga was right. Miroku! Sango! You got Kirara back? And you? l managed. But l overused my Wind Tunnel a bit. The miasma has gotten stronger. Take Kirara and make your escape. l will use my Wind Tunnel and take care of... Miroku! That Menomaru! You intend to take my souls... Fox Fire! My Fox Magic isn't working. Kaede, what can l do?! To stop this tree which is using evil to grow, only the sacred powers of Kikyo or Kagome will work. Master lnuyasha! Master lnuyasha! Please open your eyes! lt's the last wish l'll make! Snow...stop falling. l sucked too much! Kagome? l can feel him. l can feel lnuyasha! Kagome? ls that you, Kagome? lnuyasha?! How is your wound? Are you all right? This is nothing. But are you back home? l...came back... Got scared, didja? No! l...! l... What is it? No...never mind. Maybe l was running away. You're so silly. What do you mean, "silly"?! lnuyasha? You're right there... What're you worrying about? l...l'm so helpless. And l hurt you. l thought l shouldn't stay by you. Quit babbling such nonsense. lnuyasha! Don't move! You'll open your wounds. l need you. Haven't you realized that yet?! Thank you. lnuyasha... Let's go, Kagome! Yes! Oh boy... lnuyasha! l can't go back, lnuyasha! --K-Kagome! --lnuyasha! --Sis has gone bonkers! --Can you hear me, lnuyasha?! lnuyasha! ls that you, Kagome? lnuyasha! The well is covered. l can't go back. Don't give up, Kagome! Use the sacred arrow! Use that to tear apart the roots! There's no such thing in this world! There is! Gramps, give me one of these! Got it! Wait, lnuyasha! Be right there! Gramps, let me have this too! Cold, huh, Gramps? We'll have a hot pot tonight. Kagome? Mom! Don't forget this. Huh? Mom... Just be yourself. Okay? Okay! lnuyasha, how is your wound? Don't overdo it. Shaddup! l'm not built like you! lf you don't want to be killed, stay away! Go through! Here l ...! What's this?! So much smoke! Kagome! Oww! Kagome! Shippo! You're all right! Old Kaede! l'm so sorry about your hand. Don't worry about it. Hey Kagome...! lnuyasha! Didja have to make such a loud entrance?! You told me to use the arrow! l never told you to blow us up! Well, l didn't plan to! Stupid lnuyasha! She's back, and they're fighting again?! Don't worry about them. They're back to normal. Master lnuyasha! Hyoga is absorbing every living soul in this world. This is no time for arguments! l know that! Let's go, Kagome! Okay! What's that glow? Hang on tight! What is it? Darn! We're too late! Myoga?! You're not running away? l act when l must! l misjudged you, Old Myoga! He's gotten so big! Hah! That's all he is! Scaring us won't work! lnuyasha! You are okay?! Don't waste your time worrying. Half-demon, you're still alive? Shaddup! lt's payback time! The time has come! What are those demons?! They are demons from the Continent. The only way to win... is to combine the powers of Tetsusaiga and Kagome's arrow. Tetsusaiga and Kagome's arrow? Good luck to you! You're running away, after all?! My servants! Devour this world! Get a taste of my Tetsusaiga! He did it! lnuyasha, you're so strong! Damn! They're not decreasing! There are too many of them! They're coming this way! Don't come! Stupid! Kagome! Shippo! Hiraikotsu! Sango! Miroku, too! Kagome! You're all okay! l'm so glad! Nice to see you safe, too! Don't just stand there! Wind Tunnel! Leave the small fry to me! Hurry! Thank you, Miroku! Do your best! lf you die, l'll never forget you! Huh? Don't say such a thing! lt's obvious. We're gonna win! Win? A half-demon like you defeat me?! Shaddup! l'll take you on! lnuyasha! Kagome, be careful! l'll be fine. lnuyasha's with me! lnuyasha! Get up! A half-demon coupled with a mortal girl? Don't make me laugh! What's wrong with me being with him? Hah! Your tribe was turned into boneless weaklings... by cavorting with disgusting creatures called humans. Damn! His aura is too strong and its sucking up my energy. Kagome, shoot! Huh? Shoot! Aim for his body! All right! l wonder if this little arrow will work? l see it... The spot where the swirling air collides! Wind Scar! l just scratched the surface! Don't get so cocky! Feel my power! Kagome! Run! Such an intense demonic aura! ls there such a thing? He's really mad. We can win, Kagome. Huh? Next time, l'll use the Backlash Wave to send it back at him. Amazing! Do you think that, maybe, we're in way over our heads? Shall we make a run for it? Huh? Hiraikotsu! You've witnessed my power... and you still want to defy me? l'm impressed. So you still can move! Come on at me! Your mouth seems to be your only weapon, half-demon. Well, you'll see soon! lnuyasha! His demonic aura centers around the mark on his forehead. Can you aim for it? l'll try.
