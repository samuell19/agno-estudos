* Billy Boy rode out to Deadwood, * * Far from home and the family folks, * * Left his home 'lone far behind him, * * Searching for a bag of gold. * * Billy Boy was tall and handsome, * * Gentle soul, with a heart so bold, * * Swore he'd always keep on riding, * * Till he found that bag of gold. * * Under sky so bright with sunshine, * * And over mountains sweet with rain, * * Billy Boy rode West to Deadwood, * * Where the sunset weeps with flames. * ["Oh, Susanna" playing on harmonica] [wagon creaking] Whoa-whoa! All right, steady, boys. Doggone it, there's always something to take care of. Let me look at this gantry. [hooting] [gunshots] Ho-howdy, boys. I'm Tennessee Thompson, son of Dixie. Ain't causing nobody no harm. [speaking foreign language] [rattling] Ain't got nothing worth taking. Sure as hell I ain't worth killin'. [cats meowing] Just a load of pussycats, takin'em to Deadwood. [laughs] [cat meows] White man sure make big fool. Yeah, I've been a big fool ever since I had the general rattle my shots shallow, didn't pull the trigger. [laughs] [gibberish] [cat meows] What you do white man skunk? That ain't skunks, it's cats. They kill rats! Go ahead, help yourself. All Indian tents just full of rats. [laughs] [gunshot] Sure glad you happened by, son. - Get the rifles. - Yeah. Gimme that pussycat! I'll take that gun. Damn coyotes! Gimme that gun! Low stinking Indians. You too, varmint! Call my pussycats skunks again. Try to kill me, Indian? I'm gonna blast your thievin' head off! Don't be feeling your oats, old timer. You ain't aiming to turn these rotten hyenas loose, do you? They caused you no harm. Caused me no harm? They was gonna kill me, shoot me down like a rat! Be on your way! You can't trust them Indians, boy! I said, get! The only good Indian is a dead Indian! Oh, you reckless youngun! The graveyard's full of your kind, boy, and for doing what you just did. [mumbling] Doggone youngun lettin' those Indians go. Oh, this young generation's already done anyway. Piece of coward made me so mad-- Where you headin'? Deadwood. So am I. Well, you just better come along with me, then, if you ever expect to get there! * Across the wide Dakota country, * * Where the Lord ain't ever seen, * * Billy Boy, he kept on riding * * Like an eagle on dark winds. * Watcha gonna do with all them cats? I'm in the cat business, boy. But not for long, not exactly. I'm gonna load this ol' wagon here full of gold, go back to Tennessee, buy myself a plantation. There I'm gonna sit down on my veranda, in silk shirts and fancy pants, and sip them juices. You know where you gonna get all this gold? I'm gonna dig for it. You make it sound pretty easy. Oh, nothing is easy in this old world, boy. You after gold, too? Reckon so. Digging it, or taking it? I see there's been another shooting. Yes, preacher. It looks like you'll have another busy day. Maybe when we can build a church in Deadwood, people can come to know the Lord. Who was it, Kate? Oh, one of the boys spit on the dance floor again, Charlie. You know how fancy he is about that. That was a nice straw of fancy. As long as I'm working for you, Kate, we're gonna run a clean place. - Curt, Spec. - Howdy. [laughs] Purty nice shooting, Fancy. Here here. Don't wonder if Fancy don't steal his oats and decide to have her go with Wild Bill. Yeah, well Wild Bill is coming to town after Billy The Kid. Now that oughta be a real showdown. Yeah! [laughs] Can't you do anything to stop these killings? Mrs. Steadman, I'm only the deputy, not the sheriff. Mr. Harding, is it true Billy The Kid is coming to town? John Slaughter says he's riding in from Santa Fe. Hear that, Ma? I hear it and I don't like it. They don't come any faster than Billy The Kid. Hubert, you're a long ways from being a gun fighter. I can outdraw anybody in town. Maybe you can, but gunmen are something else, boy. I ain't no boy. You come on home and do your chores. Oh, Ma! - Howdy, Half-Shot. - Howdy. I see Bear Creek Johnny is at it again. Now that's the smartest man in town. Never gets himself in trouble and does a good business. Someday he's gonna be the richest man in Deadwood. Lord, help us. These people they keep coming, the young and the old into this place. They know not what they do. Oh, Lord, your people think only of gold. I need help. We need a church here, in Deadwood. Oh, Lord, we need a church. * From near and far, * * The man has gathered, * * Wildest tears these dreamers told, * * Of the bad land in the town of Deadwood, * * Where the rivers rattly go. * * They brought along their wives and children, * * The trail was long, the nights were cold, * * A brand new day would soon be dawning, * * Where they all discover gold. * Sam Bass put you up to that, Kate? Oh, put your mind to rest, Fancy. The way he's beginning to twist you around, it looks as if he's trying to take over Deadwood. Nobody's gonna take over this town. Sam Bass or any other gunman slinger. Just you, Kate, huh? You alone. Flattery will get you nowhere, Fancy Poggin. [joyful saloon music playing] Well, I didn't know you could read, Bear Creek. Kate, you're the smartest woman West of Saint Louie. - And? - And the prettiest. And? - And the richest. - And? You're gonna be all mine. Don't count on it, Fancy Poggin. [men laughing out loud] Well, that ain't polite. Ma always taught me to be polite. Poor show, maybe he got no Ma to learn him, huh? - Yeah. - [laughing] Hey, Chucky, come and pour a couple of glasses here. [man laughing] His attitude is bad. It can knock a fellow plum out without hardly getting them. Yeah. [laughs] Hey, Chucky, bring that bottle over here! How the bets come in? - Running about 50-50, I'd say. - Yeah? When Billy The Kid hits town, he'd better turn in his gear to Bear Creek. [laughs] I saw Hickok stand between two willows, draw and firing three slugs, and hit both willows at the same time. - Oh! - [laughs] Yeah, yeah. Gentlemen, any kindness would be appreciated. Are you still pushing that sack? I'm trying to build us a church here, in Deadwood. Well now, how do we know that all that money you're collectin' is going for the church, preach? Yeah, let's see what you got in that sack. All right now, stop it, boys, or Fancy will shoot. Oh, we was just funnin', Kate. [laughs] Why sure! Now you wouldn't shoot us, would you, Fance? [laughter] There's lot of money here, preacher. Take care of it. The town is growing, Miss Kate, new folks moving in. Someday we're gonna have a grand place here. We'll have a fine church. I'm pledged to. You gettin' soft, Kate? Supposin' you just pick up Charlie. [men laughing] Come on, boys, let's have a drink. ...and she's gentle and she's housebroke. Do I hear ten dollars? - Five dollars. - That's very nice, thanks. - Do I hear-- - I say ten! Thank you, friend. I hear ten dollars now, do I hear fifteen? Do I get fifteen? Somebody bits $15 now? Sold to the gentleman out here for ten dollars. Mister, you got yourself a real steal. Get them while they're left, folks, ain't many left. Not get ready for this little beauty. Her mother belonged to President Jeff Davis and her father... - Well... - [girl laughs] What will it be? - Five dollars. - Thanks, friend, five dollars. I got five dollars, do I hear ten? Ten dollars. Now here's ten dollars now, do I get fifteen? $40! Sold to the gentleman right here for $40! There you are, sir. She'll purr like [indistinct] if you pet her. Here you are, Clammie, a present for you. Oh, thank you, Walter. This here big fellow's growed up on fresh water catfish. He looks like a mountain lion. I named him General Bolyguard, that's my old commander. - What are my bids? - Five dollars. Sir, that's an insult to General Bolyguard and his good name. Go make it ten. How would you like on of them cats? Me? Oh, you gotta be kiddin', Fancy. Those scrawny little things? Besides, I have enough trouble with my girls. Yeah, they are pretty scrawny looking at that. Sold for 25 dollars! There you are, ma'am. Curt, I think I'm gonna get me one of them cats. Maybe it'll help my gal sweeten up a little bit. Yeah, sure, take a couple. Makes me feel quite sad to part with Mark Twain. I called him that on account of these whiskers, a fine mustache. - [cat meows] - [man laughs] - That'll cost you $100, friend. - Oh! That cat came all the way from Omaha. [man laughs] Did you hear that, Ben? That cat came all the way from Omaha. - Yeah. - [man laughs] Hundred dollars for the cat, mister. Huh? Well now, take it easy, sonny. You don't wanna go get yourself in trouble. Tell the kid who I am. Kid, you're talking here to Ben Hayes. And I happen to be Curt Aiken. The money or the cat. Now kid, maybe you didn't hear what I said. We're Sam Bass's boys. I don't care who you are. The money or the cat! BEN: You be kiddin' me, Curt. Maybe I oughta teach him a little lesson on respect. He sure talks big. Down in the panhandle, when punks like you hear our name they jump right out of their boots. Now where do you want to slug, kid? 'Cause I don't wanna kill ya. Well then, suppose you just leave it in your gun. [Ben laughs] Boy, I said I didn't want to kill ya, but you keep up with that big talk and... Kid, don't you know who I am? I'm Curt Aiken! Well now, maybe some of these Eastern folks ain't heard of ya, Curt. Maybe it's time they did. Yeah. I'm gonna kill you, kid. Out here you gotta back up your talk. Now let's just see if you're as fast with that gun as you are with your mouth. [horses neighing] [people clamoring] You sure got a fast gun, Billy. Billy? That's Billy The Kid. Billy The Kid? So you're Billy The Kid, huh? That's him, all right. Billy, I'm Poker Kate, I run the Greenfront. - But, Ma'am, I-- - Welcome to Deadwood. I've gotta explain something-- Pretty fancy gun played there, Billy. But I'm a-warning you. Sam Bass will be madder than a devil when he hears you gun-downed two of his top boys. Yeah, well I've seen Billy here. He can take on anybody, anytime. That was the fastest gun I ever saw, Billy. Hubert, how many times have I told you to quit playing gun slayer? That's Billy The Kid, Ma. First it was Wyatt Earp and now it's Billy The Kid. It don't look too much older. He ain't much bigger, either. [sighs] I don't care who he is. Come on! - If you dare-- - But it's Billy The Kid, Ma! Boy, I've been thinking. Why don't you and me be partners? We both want gold. Now I got the stake to get us started, you got the guns to keep us in business. Partners in what? The mining business. Sounds good. Yeah, we-we'll name it The Tennessee Mining Company. How's about it, Billy Boy? - Okay. - Right. Fifty-fifty. I was thinking more like 10% for you. Oh, no. Fifty-fifty, Tennessee. - But that's half! - That's right. Half for you, half for me. Look, let's get ourselves a drink and then we're gonna find a mine, huh? 10% for you. - No, fifty-fifty, Tennessee. - Boy, that's half! [joyful saloon music playing] Hello, Billy. They call me Montana, but I'm from New Orleans. Hey, you wanna buy a little gal a drink? - Sure! - Okay. You know, you just bought yourself one of the best claims around these parts. Just a minute, sir. If this is the best claim on these parts, how come you're selling? Ain't got no choice. - Can't work it on account of old trinket here. - Oh! You know, the Doc says that heavy work might just kill me. Here, pour another. No! No, no. I'm going over and talk to my partner. Billy Boy! We got ourselves a mine. The best claim around, as I was said. Yes, sir. There's the start of The Tennessee Mining Company. Well, Half-shot, I see you finally got rid of that worthless mine. The fool and his money is soon party. The kid is liable to draw on you when he finds out what you did to the old boy. That kid ain't gonna be around when Hickok gets here. Who sold you this? Deputy Harding. Poor feller's got a bad ticker. He can't work at it himself. - Really? - Yeah. Hello, boys. I hear you bought yourselves a mine. Yeah, we sure did. Where? [mumbling] Up there by the gray side, side of the Pop. You mean the "Pa-Pasapa"? [mumbling] That's what it says, "size'a'pappa". There's gold in those hills, all right, but that ain't all there is. Meaning? Meaning it's Injun country. Prospectors don't last long there. Don't pay Fancy no call, boys. Like he said, there's plenty of gold in them hills. Gold nuggets feel right at home, here at The Greenfront. Montana sure is a cute little thing, ain't she, Billy? She sure is. We call her our lady in red. Come to think of it, you're kinda cute yourself. [chuckles] You know, I was just about to say the same thing 'bout you. [laughs] I bet you're a real ladies' man. Hmm, I'm not one to brag, but I have had my share of funnin' with the women folks in my time. Oh, I bet you were a holy terror, handsome. Thank you, Kittie. Now, here's to your mine, and Billy's success against Wild Bill. [Tennessee singing] How do you feel? Billy Boy, we got ourselves a mine, boy. Let's go back in and get a little drink with Poker Kate, huh? Poker Kate, here I-- Whoa! That's all said, huh? [singing] * You found a partner, * * And to him his story told, * * In their search for gold, They searched for gold. * And there's gold in this here streaming. Must come for up there. Nothing, nothing. Billy Boy! Gold! Gold, Billy Boy! [laughs] You have to see this, Billy Boy! Gold! Yeah! Lookie here! Gold! Gold! This place must be full of it, Billy Boy! We're gonna be rich! [both laughing] [cheering] Billy Boy! Take a look here, won't you? Ain't that a purty sight? [laughs] Yes, sir. Big [indistinct] is gonna make us rich. I'm gonna make us a terwilliger. - You're gonna make a what? - Terwilliger. We'll terwilliger this whole area. Yes. Tennessee, you still drunk? Drunk? Back in Tennessee, when I was a youngun, I knew this feller he struck gold with his bare hands, he witched it out, just like he was hunting for water. Yeah! Seen him with my own two eyes. Old Donald Terwilliger was his name. Yeah, you go ahead and laugh, boy. Yeah, laugh all you want to. He just wanted to be the richest man in Tennessee. Yeah, Donald Terwilliger. [playing the harmonica] If the Indians didn't know we're here, sure in the hell know now. Better take turns sacking in tonight. [playing the harmonica] Where you from, Billy? Georgia. You don't loved it. Fight in the war? Georgia's 5th Regiment. I was twelve when I went in. [laughs] I'll be. [playing the harmonica] Uh, how come you drifted away out here? It's a long story. Well, we got nothing but time. Well, after I got home from Gettysburg, I found nothing but ashes where my house once stood. Fields were burnt. Horses stolen. Nothing. My Ma never recovered. Pa never came back. Heard he was killed over at Shiloh. So I just took off and hit it West. Kept on the move. [playing the harmonica] That's how you got your reputation, huh? Drifting. How many men you figure you killed, Billy? I'm not Billy The Kid, Tennessee. My name is Billy May. You mean you're not The Kid? I never said I was. They think you are in town. Let them think it. The way I look at it, there's gonna be a lot less trouble that way. Less trouble? With Hickcok and Sam Bess around, boy, you're in for a heap of trouble. Every gun slinger will try to oversize you, boy. And I took you in as a partner, as the genuine Billy. - That's right, Tennessee. - Yeah. Fifty-fifty. Wasn't it gonna be my gun and your stake'd make us rich? But I thought you was Billy The Kid. But it's still the same gun that helped you. Yeah. * Billy Boy was like a storm cloud, * * But as the grass is fit the sun, * * Like the pine trees meet the mountain, * * Billy made his fate with God. * [snoring] - Tennessee. - [growling] - Let's go! - Hm? All right. Where? What? [mumbling] [snoring] [startles] You could have been a dead man, Tennessee. Now you stay awake, you hear? Uhm, you ain't thinkin' about maybe, maybe cuttin' off your partner, eh, Billy? There ain't gonna be no partners and no nothing if you keep falling asleep on guard! Now I like my scalp just where it is. Billy. [coyote howling] [hooting] [speaks foreign language] [speaks foreign language] We meet again, young one. Spotted Snake not forget. No harm will come to you for now. [speaks foreign language] [speaks foreign language] Pa? Billy? - Pa! - My Billy boy! I thought you was dead. I thought you was, too. All these years, you growed into a big man. - You're growed some too, Pa. - [laughs] [speaks foreign language] Little Bird, Spotted Snake's daughter. I guess that's about the whole story, Billy. But, Pa, you can't do this. Why, you still fightin' the war? Yes, and I'll never stop. But the South surrendered. No Yankee took my sword, and they never will. Never! You saw what they did to our land. How they treated our women folks. And you'd give into. But, Pa, don't you understand? The war is over! It's been over for several years, Pa. There's no more fighting. What are you doing here, wasting away your life? Here, with my Indian friends, I found something, Billy. The Indians are great soldiers. Look at Red Cloud. I bet with Goat, Crazy Horse, Rain in the Face, together we can annihilate the 7th cavalry. You mean you're planning a war? The Sioux are planning war. I'm what's left of the army. And I believe in them, in their cause. The Yankees are doing to them just what they did to us, but when we're ready, the Yankees will go such hell as they've never known before. I can't believe it. I just can't believe it. If we can destroy Custer, the Sioux can force a treaty and retain the Black Hills, and then this will become the headquarters for what's left of the Confederacy. Billy, you must join us. Pa, I think you oughta come with me and forget this whole crazy scheme. They need men like you in Deadwood. Deadwood? When I go to Deadwood, I'll take an army of warriors and I'll burn it to the ground. And I'll raise the Confederate where I go with the ashes, in the name of the Sioux. But you can't do that. Don't you see? You're using the Indians for your own purpose. You wait and see. Soon you'll here what happens to Custer! Pa, you're taking like a mad man. I am a madman! I've got good cause to be. Now you stay here with us. You'll think different. Here, you can have it. Go on. I got that from General Olstry. Little soldier of great white leader. You changed your mind, Billy? Look, Pa. I got a partner. He's working on our claim. - So I gotta get back. - But, son, I... Billy, this is chief Big Foot. Chief Goat and Crew Dog, friend of Crazy Horse. My friends, my boy will soon join us. He to is a confederate and an experienced soldier. Pa, I ain't joining nothing. I thought him how to handle pistols and he's fast as the best of them. Ain't that right, Billy? Tonight you sit with our counsel. Pa, I said I had to go. Why don't you leave these people to their ways? You don't need to teach them white man's war. Teach these men? Why I learned from them more than they learned from me. These chiefs are great generals, great as any white general. Goat could've stood up to Stonewa Jackson. Crazy Horse and Crew Dog, all fine generals. Tonight we'll feast and then we'll counsel. And the Confederacy will be born again, Billy! [chanting] - Billy? - Billy. Billy. I gotta be going, Pa. Son, what are you aiming to do? I'm sorry, Pa. I don't think your way. Well, go then! But you'll come back. You and I don't have a country. This is our country, our home. No, Pa, this is not my home. Great chief, I do not want any part of war. I only want gold so I can go back to Georgia and leave in peace. Peace? All men should think peace. You may dig all the gold you want. My braves will not harm you. Go. Thank you. Bye, Pa. * Billy Boy has met his true love, * * Indian girl with a face so fair, * * She would be forever faithful, * * Fill her soul with a love so real. * Tennessee! Tennessee! What are you doing here? I stay with you. You can't do that. You better go back to your people. You're a little young to be riding about alone. Do you understand what I say? I am not lone . I am with you. You can't stay with me. Why? Because you can't, that's why. I stay. You can't stay. I stay. You see this shirt? This belonged to my partner, Tennessee Thompson. Something's happened to him, It's not safe here. My people won't bother you anymore. There's other people here besides your people. Now go! I said go. Pretty little gal, ain't she, Spec? Mighty purty for a squaw. Sure looks tender. Yeah. [men laughing] [girl screams] Go on! Get her! Grab her good! Get her! Fast! It will be easier if you don't fight it. Give it to her! Go on! Stay still, stop fighting! Come on, you look like a fool! Come on already! - [groaning] [screaming] - [laughing] She's gonna be all right. Was she...? Yeah, and whoever did it has a few scratches on him. I found skin and blood under her fingernails. Can I? Can I see her? She's resting now. A little later. Thanks, Doc. [saloon music playing] [men laughing] Boys, I wanna have myself a house like ol' Andy Jackson's place, with those big white pillars, old purtied up. And I'm gonna wear imported clothes and smell sweet. Boys, you looking at the richest man in Tennessee. Here's a draft of the contract with a private bank in San Francisco, Mr. Thompson. Just sign your name. $40,000. And this is just to start, you say. Just to start, Mr. Thompson. You say the Injuns got Billy. Yes, poor kid. I tried to save him, but couldn't. It almost cost me my life. It's such a shame, you know, 'cause Billy could've been a rich boy. Billy? Billy! [stammers] I thought you was dead. Yeah, I just heard what you thought. Uhm, oh, we struck it rich, Billy Boy. Look, here's a draft for $40,000. We're in the mining business, boy. I just signed the deal with Mr. O'Hara here. He's gonna do the minin' for us. All we gotta do is-is sit back and spend it. Tennessee tells us you're not Billy The Kid. I-I thought I'd tell the truth, Billy Boy. You know? Ain't no reason for not telling the truth. Oh, I'm sure glad to see you alive, Billy Boy. I worried something terrible about you. Come on, boy. I'll buy you a drink. You know, kid, Hickok's arriving from Cheyenne tomorrow. He'll know if you're The Kid or not. A lot of money's riding on The Kid. Don't get any ideas about leaving town. Not before tomorrow, that is. You don't expect Billy to go against Hickok, do you? He wouldn't have a chance. Let's get that drink, boy. If you'll excuse me, Miss Kate. Mister Poggin. How well do you know Wild Bill, Kate? Well enough, why? There's a lot of people in town that still think this boy here is The Kid. A lot of money's riding on him. A little talk with Hickok and we could clean up on this. Yeah. You may not believe this, but I tried to save you from those Indians, boy. That is right. Almost cost me my life, too. I thought you met up with some kind of trouble when I found your shirt with blood on it. Oh, I tore that while I was workin' on the wagon. You thought that I was-- I thought you was dead, you thought I was dead. Uh, a celebration. Celebration, yeah. Let's have a little drink. Chucky, send me another bottle. Jollie, take this bottle in to Spec. Okay, Chucky. Don't go away. I'll take it to him. - Hey! [girl laughing] [laughter, giggling continues] Come on, Montana, give ol' Spec a little kiss. Hey, what happened to your face? You tangled with a wild cat? Yeah, baby, she sure was some wild cat. [both laughing] Give it here, boy. Give it here. That's all, boy. You can close the door on your way out. [laughs] [screaming] - What happened? - What was that? What happened? - He's dead! - What's wrong? He was just lying there dead. - What is it? - You don't understand? - Oh! - What happened? Billy shot Spec! You out of your mind? You just gunned down two more of Sam Bass's boys, Billy. Pretty fancy shooting there, Billy. I'm betting 500 more on The Kid, any takers? [crowd approving] [saloon music resumes] * When the crowd began to gather, * * On the streets of Deadwood town, * * Billy knew that Wild and Hickok * * Would be there to gun him down. * * Oh, Billy Boy... * [knocking on door] - Who is it? - Tennessee. The Doc told me about that Injun gal. So that's why you gunned down them two men, huh? I'm sure you didn't come here to say that, Tennessee. So what do you want? I came to tell you that Hickok just rode into town. He checked into the hotel. Poker Kate and Fancy Poggin is with him right now, having a little talk about you. They're not sure you're not The Kid. Come tomorrow, you will be dead and they'll be richer. A lot of money being bid on you, boy, especially after tonight. I've been telling everybody you ain't The Kid, but nobody believes me! You worried about me again, Tennessee? You ain't fixin' to take Hickok on, are you? Oh, Billy Boy, nobody's that fast. Not even Earp or Clay Alysson. I didn't say I was taking anybody on. Yeah, but you're thinking it. I can see it in your eyes. Listen to me, boy. Leave now or you gonna be dead tomorrow. All you damn gun slayers is a lie! Maybe. It aint' just Hickok you gotta worry about. Sam Bass's gonna be here, too, and he's gonna be firing mad when he finds out that you gunned down four of his boys. If you stay here tomorrow, you're just aching to be laid in the grave. That's mighty kind of you to worry about me so, Tennessee. Why the sudden change of heart? Boy, tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna make you full partner again. On one condition. You leave now, while you can. Go to them friends you was telling me about. Them Injuns friends. Is it me or that mine you're worried about, Tennessee? You confounded youngun! More stubborn than an army mule! Tennessee. - Good night. - Good night! [mumbling] - Beautiful night. - Yeah. Thanks for the drink, Kate. See you in the morning, Fancy. Good night, Bill. Good night. Well, Kate, looks like we're in business. Hickok doesn't know it, yet, but he's working for us. Don't be too sure, Fancy. Hickok's no fool. Neither am I, Kate. - Mr. Hickok? - Yes? You don't know me, my name is Tennessee Thompson. I'd like to talk to you about tomorrow, if you got a few minutes. Seems like a lot of people want to talk about tomorrow. That boy going up against you tomorrow... He ain't Billy The Kid. Why is he passing him off as The Kid? Well, he never actually said that he was. The town just sort of took it for granted after he gunned down Ben Hayes and Curt Aiken. He gunned down Spec Greer and Hawk Russell, too. Those boys are pretty fast guns. It takes a good man to do that. What is it that you want, Mr. Thompson? I don't want Billy to get killed. No one's forcing him into a showdown with me. You know how younguns are. Yes, I know how they are. They all want to be a big man. Look, Mr. Thompson, I've never seen Billy The Kid, and I don't know if this boy is him or not, so... I can't take a chance. Mr. Hickok! I just saw you there talking to Fancy Poggin and Poker Kate. Now they both know that he ain't Billy The Kid. I understand and I heard that you're a square shooter. If you are Mr. Hickok, you won't gun down that boy tomorrow. Boy, you draw fast Hubert. Pretty soon, folks are gonna be hearing 'bout that Bad Land's Kid. The Bad Land's Kid? Is that how you're gonna call yourself, Hubert? [scoffs] The Bad Land's Kid. Yeah! The Bad Land's Kid. And I'm gonna be the fastest gunner in the Dakota territory. I bet you could outdraw Billy The Kid. I bet he can't. Yeah, I've been thinking about taking him on. Really? [scoffs] He's not gonna take on Billy The Kid. Yeah? You listen to me, Ernie. I can outdraw you any day. Hubert, you come home right away, young man. But, Ma! [squeaky voice] Get over here, your Mommy wants you. I'm gonna get you, Ernie. What time is it, Fancy? We'll be rich in ten minutes. How you bettin', Fancy? Hickok looks pretty good. A hundred on Hickok. You're on. * Oh, Billy Boy * I still say Hickok is the fastest gun around. Ain't no faster than Billy The Kid. On twenty bucks I say it is. Hey, here he comes now. He don't look so tough. You wanna take him on? He don't scare me. - Mighty big talk, kid. - Yeah? My brotherin, hear me. More blood spilled here'll only sink us deeper into sin. Let us unite in the brotherhood of good. For The Lord so wrote: Man must know, man must walk alone. - Morning. - Morning, Wild Bill. - Kate. - Mornin', Bill. Looks like a nice day for the showdown. What time is it? Two minutes to eleven. * Oh, Billy Boy * Where's The Kid at, Fancy? The Kid ain't gonna show. Where is he, Fancy? He'll be here. He'd better. I think he's afraid to show up. Where is The Kid, Fancy? * Oh, Billy Boy * * Oh, Billy Boy * Billy, don't it. Walk away and stay alive. I was talking to Hickok, he don't wanna kill you, but you gotta walk away now. Billy, you're gonna get yourself killed! I hear you came to kill me, Billy. I came to Deadwood to dig for gold. John Slaughter says you came to gun me down. I never saw John Slaughter in my life. TENNESSEE: That's true, he never saw him! [people clamoring] Are you Billy The Kid? - No. - He is The Kid! [people clamoring] What's your name, son? Billy May. He's just trying to talk his way out of it! Hickok's afraid of him! - MAN: Hey, come on! - Go on already! [clamoring enhances] Boys! Boys! Keep it together! Thank The Lord. I asked to make these men friends and He heard me. Preacher, maybe you got something there. [laughs] Someday I'm gonna read that good book of yours. We can begin together. There is a verse in Matthew, that I think'd be appropriate. - Ah, here. - Huh? Read for yourself. Preacher, I confess. I can't read. Mr. Hickok. I don't know what to say to you. Forget it, Billy. Any relation to Boone May? He's my Pa. - You know him? - Sure. Hunted buffaloes with him a while back. Heard he's living with the Indians now. Yeah. He used to be proud of you, Billy. Keep it that way. Billy May! Maybe Wild Bill's afraid of you, but I ain't. And I aim to prove it. [people screaming] No, Hubert! [crying] Hubert. Ma... Ma! Ma! Oh! He used to call himself the Bad Land Kid. You know, he never even seen the Bad Land. I am sorry, ma'am. But you see, I had no choice. He was aiming to shot me in the back. You murderer! He was only fifteen! Only fifteen. I'm sorry. Sorry? Your kind got no feelings. You murderer! Murderer! Are we gonna just stand here and watch a 15 year old boy murdered? - No! - Let's hang him! - [people approving] - Now wait a minute! Hold! I'm tellin' you he's not guilty, he shot the kid in self defense. Just how you know it was self defense? Because I talked to him and he saw the whole thing. That's right, he did do it in self defense. Hanging is too good for that Billy. You keep out of this, you no good little varmint. - Don't you call me a varmint! - MAN: Here comes Sam! How are you, Sam? Fancy. Guess you heard about your boys. Yeah, too bad. Town looks pretty riled. Oughta be. Same fella just gun downed a 15 year old boy. Sam, don't you think it's about time we had a hangin' around here? [people approving] Seems like a good day for one, Kate. Where is the kid now? Billy Boy, you gotta get out of town fast. They're comin' to hang ya! Sam Bass is leading them. They got blood in their eyes. Come on, let's get out the back way. Take Little Bird back to her people. What about you? Never mind about me, I'll meet you at the Indian camp. Now get! Go on, Tennessee. Look, I ain't gonna leave you here. If you're with me, they might hang you, too. Now get out of here! Go on! Hyah! Ha! Go on! Go on! Hyah! Hey! He's in the stables! Here he is! Move and you're dead. We got him, boys! We got him. You can't hang this boy! I beg you, don't commit this crime. This isn't the way. He shot that kid, preacher! This isn't the way! This isn't the way! * Billy Boy won't see his homeland, * * Preacher Smith said prayers for Bill, * * But they took him to meet his Maker, * * Upon lonesome Hangman's Hill. * [hooting] Yeah, up there. That should do it. Let's go, boys! Come on! Bring in the kid, Hank. Anything to say, kid? - Come on already! - Let's get thing over with. Yeah, come on. Let's get it over with. In the name of mercy! You can't do this. Go on back to town, preacher. Save the sermons for them that need it. This boy's entitled to a fair trial. He had a fair trial! How 'bout the Steadman boy? Did he get a fair trial? My boys, did they get a fair trial? You know your boys disgraced a young Indian girl, you know what they did! And this kid took the law into his own hands, when he should've gone to deputy Harding. But no, he killed in cold blood, shot Ben and Curt when they was only funnin'. He hangs! You're not gonna hang him! - Go on already! - Let's get it over with! I'm not gonna let you hang him! [men laughing] I'm not gonna let you do it! Get out of the way, preacher, or you're gonna get hurt. If you hang this boy, you'll have to kill me, too. Preacher! That tin cup of yours needs a-filling. Now you get back to town and get it filled. When I say move, you move! "Lord is my shepherd, I'll shall not want." "He makes me lie down in green pastures.' "He leads me beside still waters." "He restores my soul." "He leads me in the paths of righteousness" "for His name's sake." I have tried to tell him. I tried to tell him, but... [crying] Ain't now way he'd listen to me. He wouldn't listen to me. Son of great white leader will always live with us. * In Deadwood town, the wind is silent, * * On Hangman's Hill, the air is cold, * * Billy Boy, he lays there dying * * In a canyon paved with gold. * * Billy Boy, he lays there dying * * In a canyon paved with gold. *
