It's been 15 days since Zimbi left. It seems to me that he should have returned by now. Professor, I noticed that you are very much looking forward to Zimby's return. I may ask, what secret are you hiding even from me? This is a very important secret. But I think that now I can tell you everything. For the last 10 years I have been searching for the treasures of King Solomon... ... which is hidden in the Shiba Mountains. King Solomon's treasure? Professor, do you believe this stuff too? There are no treasures. These are just legends invented to entertain children. Shut up, you fool! I've gone crazy? I'm a child? If I was not sure that these treasures exist... ... have I wasted so many precious years of my life? - Sorry sir! After reading thousands of books... ... I have come to the conclusion that the treasure does exist. But not a single book contains a map by which to find these treasures. But how do you find the treasure? The chief of the tribe Sharrishan Mobolo has a map. His ancestors protect her more than their lives. This map is still painted on the chest of the tribal leader. But until today, no one has seen her. She is mentioned only in one book on the history of Africa. Zimbi went into the wild jungle with pilgrims to find a map. Then I think it is pointless to wait for it. You sent him to the jungle. From where no one has ever returned. You sent him to his death. Zimbi, my friend, did you find this card? Death will overtake everyone... ... whose feet will head towards the treasures of King Solomon. Where is this map? Zimbi, my friend, how can I pay for your service. This is Babu. - Yes! The professor found the map. Where is the professor now? And his beautiful daughter? Both are here. Then do the following. Leave the door open today. Be on your guard yourself. - Good. The professor and the girl should be here with the map by tomorrow morning. This animal. Why kill him? Kill the man. There is more poison in a man than in a snake. More than a snake. Now that you're here, let's play again. I missed it. Try again. Dance to the tune of the flute. You will dance? Yes, dance! Dance! You are crazy? This hand is on guard. Come here. Leave her, she will bite you. When your enemy is trapped, you shouldn't feel sorry for him. Please let him crawl away. If one day Zoro catches someone, he will never let go. You know my habits. If you don’t let her go, I won’t talk to you. You will not? - Not. Then crawl. My lips burn like fire. They are no less poisonous than snake venom. Kiss my snake-like curls. Kiss me and dance with me. I can break your heart with one piercing look. I will arrest you with my chain of hands. If you are proud of yourself, then unite with me. If you want to play with danger, then play with me. My lips burn like fire. Even death is afraid of you, you are such a brave man. If you're near, who should I be afraid of? My heart is not for everyone. If you ask my heart, you will get it. My lips burn like fire. Professor, Zoro has been looking for this map for years. You will have to regret that you took it away from us. It is only fools who pity. You and your father know me very well. In any case, you must do me a favor. Which one? Until we find the treasure of King Solomon... ... you have to help me. What are you trying to say? Do you love your father? Yes. “Then only you can do this job. What kind of job? Two hunters live 200 miles away. They know Africa like the back of their hand. And you.... - What? You have to go to them and lie. You should tell them that a year ago... ... your brother went to look for the treasures of King Solomon... ... and disappeared. - But this is not true. You can only get there in search of your lost brother. You will have to persuade these two hunters. Persuade? Play a play? You are young and beautiful. And beautiful women always attract daredevils. But you are putting my daughter in danger. It is in your best interest to remain quiet. Sunita, you are beautiful and smart. And with your beauty and intelligence, nothing is impossible for you. Go on. I mean, you have to charm them. And if they suspect something, you have to pay them 100,000 shillings. What if I refuse? Your dad loves to scream, and I love to silence people. When should I go there? You will go tomorrow. TWO HUNTERS He's lucky to have this rhino stay here. And the rhinoceros that we caught yesterday should be sent to the Bombay Zoo. Let this animal grow up. He needs to be sent with other animals to the Paris Zoo. Listen, don't send him to the London Zoo. He's my favorite. Send another there. Let her stay here. Feed the beast better. And look again. Let's continue. What's up, Stookie? A crazy elephant entered the village. He killed two men. Please help us. - Okay. Lucky, keep the papers. And put my weapon in the jeep. Get in the car. Girl! Can I see Mr. Ranjit? - Tell me what you want? Oh, so you are Mr. Ranjit? - No, my name is Satish. I work on this estate. “But I want to meet Mr. Ranjit. Ranjit is now absent. Why are you standing? Sit down. Where are you from? - From India. Your name? - Sunita Saxena. What can we do for you? Who you are? - It... She is the owner of this house. Ms. Sherri. She's so strict. And I am her driver. You....? When the owner is not working, I work. Tell me which animal do you want? Lion, leopard, rhino, monkey. We can catch any animal for you. I don't need animals. - What then? I came here looking for my brother. In Nairobi, I learned that Mr. Ranjit knows the region very well. And I am willing to pay 100,000 shillings to find my brother. 100,000 shillings ?! - Do you have them? Go and rest. Ranjit will be arriving soon. Gulla, bring her luggage. This is your number. The number may be small, but I'm sure you won't have any problems. The bathroom is over there. Take a dip and you will feel refreshed. What do you think about? I never expected that a thousand kilometers from home... ... I will be greeted with such warmth. It's true. Ms. Sherri is a wonderful woman. Gull. - Coming, madam. What happened? - Snake !! What happened? Don't worry, she won't do anything. The snake is manual. Manual? I was terribly scared. He must have been flirting in his previous birth. He always creeps up when he sees a beautiful girl. Do the following... - Call me, Sunita. Okay, Sunita. - Go. I'll be back soon. And one day he decided to shoot a lion. The bullet was very impudent, it missed the target. When the lion came, knowing that no one would shoot... ... he came here to apologize. Ranjit, where are you going? - I have important business. Sunita has come to see you. - Why? What's the matter? You've probably heard about the treasures of King Solomon. Many years ago one of my ancestors came here in search of treasures. He did not return, but his servant returned. And then he went crazy. He brought a map. Listen... Please listen to me. Tell me what you wanted to say quickly. Many years later, my brother came here for this treasure... ... and disappeared. And you want me to find your brother? - Yes! I'm sorry, but I can't help you. Ranjit, think what will become of her brother. Sherri, you're thinking about her brother or your people. She will pay us 100,000 shillings for this work. Satish, human life is more valuable than any wealth in the world. Don't worry Sunita, I'll help you. Do not Cry. Sir, before she died, my mother said something. What? My father was the king of the Kankola tribe. Yes? - Yes, sir. I was very young then. The enemies killed my father, and my mother fled with me and came here. I will avenge my father's death. I will not spare his enemies! Don't worry, I'll help you. I am not doing you a favor, Ambaba. It's my duty. We will go together and make sure you get what you owe. Cheer up, Sunita. You don't know Ranjit. He has a good heart. “Sherri, you always praise Ranjit. This is true? She came from far away, and he doesn't look after her? I know better than you what I should and shouldn't. I will look for your brother. - Really? But I have two conditions. Put 100,000 shillings in the bank tomorrow in Sherri's name. And second... - I will definitely go with you. If you deliberately want to take a risk, you can come with me. Give me a map. This is Sunita. I'm at Safari Lodge. - How are you? - I'm fine! Mr. Ranjit is here. I spoke to him. Open a 100,000 shillings deposit to Sherri in Nairobi. I will do so. But when do they leave? Tomorrow morning at any cost. Do not worry about that. Pack your things by tomorrow morning. We will follow them. For the treasure of King Solomon... ... I can go looking for your brother a hundred times. Satish, hasn't Ranjit come yet? - He went to catch a rhino. But for some reason he was late today. The rhino is not English to be punctual. Before leaving, we must fulfill the contract with the London Zoo. All is ready. I caught a huge rhino today. But how? - With bare hands. Seeing me, the rhino ran. And I ran after him. I ran and ran... But what happened next? He turned to me. I turned... He turned to me. I turned around. But what happened next? Finally I rushed to him. He knelt down... ... and apologized to me. Who is it? Who caught the rhino? - I... No, it's the master. Where is the owner? - He's in a great mood. A life. A life... Do not tease me. Why did I become a stranger at the celebration of life? The shadows of the beauties are dancing. Desires are growing. Why am I doomed to be alone? Why is my heart so lonely? Life... Oh, life... Under the shining moon the night woke up in the jungle. Beauty dances and sings. The night causes confusion in my heart. Someone he lacks. A life. A life... Oh life... These beautiful flowers are like faces. Dancing bodies sway. Only I forgot what it means to live. But why am I the only one who is a stranger at the celebration of life? A life. Oh life... Satish, have you checked the tires and engines of these jeeps? Do not worry about anything. We checked everything. Get in the jeep and start our journey. But you won't come with us. - Why? Because I cannot knowingly endanger your life. Let him ride with us, please! “Yes, master, she’s right. Take it with you. - Why? If something happens on the trip, then a woman can only tell a woman... ... who can tell her? - Gullu, mind your own business! Ranjit please! - I said that you will not go. Enter the house. Go! Let's go. Sherri, are you crying? Do not Cry. - Everyone will go, you will go too. I don't care at all. But remember that leaving me here is a sin. But they honk outside. I'm coming! I'm going. Sherry. Oh my heart. Oh my life... Where is your destination? The traveler goes forward. Ahead is darkness as far as the eye can see. All paths are unknown. Everything is strange around. Oh my heart. Oh my life... Who do you wish for day and night? Whose desire has turned into pain? Why are desires so crazy, who can tell? You are your own confidant. Oh my heart. Oh my life... The earth is dusty, the sky is smoke. Although there is fear, desires are unshakable. Storm or storm, they all pass. They cannot stop the caravan. Oh my heart. Oh my life... Gullu, we have a flat tire. Don't sit, carry a spare tire. I will change the tire. Sunita, don't be afraid. There is a village nearby, I will call someone for help. Sherri's boots? Rather, do not hesitate! Sir, I'm looking at Sherri's shoes. What kind of shoes? - Even her pants in shoes. Are Sherri's pants here? What nonsense are you talking about? Get your spare tire. What happened? Why are you screaming? - Sherri! Where is Sherri? - Here. You! - Yes I'm here. I don't mind our trip, but what do you tell Ranjit? I will answer Ranjit. Get out the wheel! Let's go. How do you? - Strong as a lion. What brought you here? - I'm going to Tororo. Oh, so you are looking for treasure too? No, friend, I'm looking for someone who has gone missing... ... in search of these treasures. Not! No one returned from there alive. Tarzan, I swear by our friendship. I will definitely be back. Satish, is everything all right? Yes, but I'm bored. - Boring? If you don't like it, you can come back even now. Because the further journey is even more boring. I mean if Sherri was here it wouldn't be so boring. So go get her if you want. “You don’t need to follow her. I will call her and she will come. - What do you mean? The sky is calling the earth: "Come to the abode of love." Leaving the world behind, breaking false promises... ... I'm going. I'm going. Who called me? Where I am? You are in hell. I forbade you to come with us. Yes, forbidden, but you don't hear... Leaving the world behind, breaking false promises, I go. Stop carrying this nonsense! Do you think that I am your enemy, forbidding you to come here? No, you are still my enemy. Sherri, if I hadn't promised your dad... Okay, die if you want. Why should I care about this? Sherri, have you eaten yet? Get up and eat. I am not hungry. Are you mad at Ranjit or the food? Leave me alone, Sunita. Crazy girl! Forget love, nobody can cry on an empty stomach. Do you need Ranjit? Go, he's sitting alone in the street. Walk up to him and tell him how you feel. But how can I express my pain to this stone? You shouldn't talk about pain, but about your love. And then: your smile, your beauty, will make your love even more beautiful. Go... Go... I'm going. Not in these clothes. In Rome, you have to dress like the Romans. What are you saying? - You go wild in the wild. Crazy wind, crazy night. My youth plays with fire. My body is on fire. What is this fire? Come and squeeze me in your arms. Crazy wind, crazy night. Come, there are many treasures hidden within me. I will open them all for you. Everything belongs to you, whether you believe me or not. What do you want, tell me. The depth of my eyes, my inviting lips? I will give you whatever you ask for. Come and squeeze me in your arms. Crazy wind, crazy night. The weather is beautiful and the darkness is enchanting. The wind is calling. The heart insists only on your embrace. I enjoy life only when I am with you. How can I hug you and smile? The stars hide their faces in confusion. Come and squeeze me in your arms. Crazy wind, crazy night. Satish, it's not worth repairing the jeep. - Why? From here we will go on foot. Pack our luggage. Ranjit, how do I look? - Like an Indian princess. But can you walk in this jungle saree? Ask the Indian lady to get ready. Sunita! What happened? Snake! Ambaba! Hey Ambaba! My first aid kit, faster! We will not go further. Let's break our camp here. It would be better if I died. Then you would get rid of this dangerous journey. We went to find your brother. Our journey will continue until we find your brother. Or until we get lost. What is it? Pour in some tea. “You’ll have to do it yourself. Well then, get me some fresh lime juice. “You’ll have to do it yourself. - Why? All the servants fled last night. And the owner? - He's not in the tent. Even the owner ran away. Now I will have to look after the girls myself. Now I will become the owner and prove myself! I'm going to kill the lion. Get my gun. No, bring me a bottle. Bottle. Ranjit sent all his people back. This is a very good move. I think we should send all our men too. Africa is a very beautiful place. Feel like I'm going to die here. Let's get out of here! Or we will all die here. Paan of Benares is the pride of the jungle. It is stronger than wine. Starting to chew paan... ... you get so much energy. As if born again. Chewing Paan from Benares... ... reveals your intelligence. Oh God, what have I got myself into? Who did I find. I was so naive. I wonder at what point I met an educated girl... ... and was fascinated by her sweet words. This guy is from the banks of the Ganges. The girl is overwhelmed by my beauty. A sweet knife pierced my heart. This fair-skinned and witty girl. She stole my heart out of the blue. Having found it, I am ready to sacrifice my heart. This guy is from the banks of the Ganges. Hey, he's my friend, let him go. Gullu, how much do you eat? Do you have a stomach or a warehouse? What did you say? Did you call my stomach a warehouse? Sure. After eating meat, you will want to drink, but you will not find water in the desert. I will not eat meat. “So let me eat to be satiated. It's your business. If this map is correct, we will cross the desert in 3-4 days. Gullu, get some water and take the meat with you. We may have to eat it on the way. Stop, Gullu. - Why? We have to go all night. Can you walk if you eat so much? Nobody knows what will happen to us at the end of this journey. There are six of us, but we have one destiny... ...is this good or bad. I just want to say that we will never part. Our journey will begin after sunset. Until then, all take a break. Why is the moon so fiery? Why is the night so cold? My body is shaking. The wind blows. Come on, I'm desperate. Come, my eyes long to see you. My love, these lonely nights scare me. I am awake with love. I will hum. The night does not sleep, I will not come just like that. Ask Luna not to look. Ask Luna to lower her eyes. Come, my eyes long to see you. Oh night, don't go. Oh wind, don't blow. A lotus blooms in the lake of sleep. My heart longs to love you. Come, my eyes long to see you. Wait. We'll stay here until the sun goes down. Give everyone food and water. Master, the day seems endless in this heat. Whether the day ends or not, we will definitely die. Why don't we dig a hole and lie down in it? - Stop talking nonsense. Satish, he's right. If you dig a hole, lie down in it and cover yourself with bushes... ... it won't be that hot. “A damn good idea! Whether we will be hot or not, at least we won't have to... ... to dig your own grave. Take it. - I think that's enough. Stop! Join hands and lie down! One sand for the next hundred meters. What happened? - What is it? Water. - Where is the water? Look there! - What's the matter? Sunita! What are you doing? - Water! Where are you going? - Leave me alone! Water! I will drink water. - Where do you see the water? Sunita, wake up! I can smell water. Do you mistake the smell of death for the smell of water? I can smell water in the air. Yes. And it will pour on our dead bodies. Will wash the sand off our bones No, there is water here. - So go and find her. She needs artificial respiration. Wake up, Sunita. Look here... Look. Animal tracks? But animals are found only near water bodies. Water... water... Water... treasures... - What treasures? Treasures of King Solomon. - Treasures of King Solomon? Do you know where they are? Where are they? - Give me water first. I'm dying. - No, don't die. I'll get water, it's not far. Don't die, I'll bring water. Do not die. Take it, drink the water. Now show me the way. - Give me more. No, show me the way first. King Solomon's treasures are beyond the mountains. You have not seen as much dew on the grass as there are diamonds. I know, but how did you get there? Map... - Give me a map... My friend, if you died without saying anything... ... I would dig my own grave. But now I will bury you. Host, water. Water! - Go drink water. What are you doing here? I was bored. I decided to make a man out of sand and talk to him. Talking to the Sandman? Go on. Hey beauty let me hide you. Why not try you secretly? You are very spicy. You are very beautiful. Your beauty is so seductive. I cannot contain myself. Hey beautiful let me hide you. Why not try you secretly? You are very spicy. Why not? You are very beautiful. Why not? Your beauty is so seductive. Oh my God. I cannot contain myself. I walk around you with pleasure. I hold you in my arms. I will make you infamous. I will squeeze you in my arms and kiss you. Hey beautiful let me hide you. Why not try you secretly? You are very spicy. Without a doubt. You are very beautiful. Without a doubt. My heart longs for you. Oh my God. Everyone wants you. Satish, don't shoot! Master, they will kill us right now. When I tell you "Fire", you must not miss the target. What did he say? “He invited us to his place tonight. What are you doing, Gullu? - Master, this water is excellent! I drank two sips and was as drunk as two bottles of wine. What's up, Satish? He says that two men came here before us. One died trying to escape. And the other fell into a trap in the mines of King Solomon. Does he know who was killed and who was trapped? No, but Sunita is sure that her brother was trapped. Brother. - Yes. When she went there, I stopped her... ... because it's not safe to go there today. Why? - Because today is Gagool's night. Who is Gagool? - She's a witch. She knows who is the king's friend and who is the enemy. She will dance at the court tonight... ... and will point the finger at who is the enemy of the king. Then this person will be killed. This is the tradition here. So that's why the king has invited us to court today. May be. But we will survive or be killed. All of you go, I will go for Sunita and come. Good. Come on, Sherri. Come on, Gullu. Look! Sunita, hurray! - What happened? This is a paradise where your brother and my dreams are trapped. Today they will come true! - But where did you get this map? From the angel who now sleeps in the cold sand. Ranjit, what's going on? Ambaba is a real king. Here is his royal symbol. Truth will prevail. Good luck my friend. Ok, friend. You have taken back your kingdom. I kept my promise. But I have one more promise to fulfill. No one can put these pieces together. Try it. It is impossible - What to do now? Satish, are you here? - You are alive? Yes. Thank God! - Are you okay? What is it? - Shreds of my shattered fate. This is a map. - Map? We don't need a map anymore. What do you mean? - I mean.... Master! I'm leaving! What if we get killed? And this poor fellow came here in search of wealth. But all the treasures of the world will not help him today. Let's go. Don't worry, we've come for you. Get up. Let's go. Where are you going? So you tried to deceive us? I can kill you right now. But no. You have to show me where the diamonds are. You must show me where the treasures of King Solomon are. Tell me where are the diamonds? Where are these treasures? Tell me... Tell me! Where are these treasures because of which I ruined my whole life? I won't leave until I find them. Tell me where they are! Forget about those lifeless stones. You saved your life, consider that you got everything. We are not interested in diamonds. But I'm only interested in diamonds. Tell me where are these treasures? Tell me! Satish, you are the person who makes mistakes and then regrets it. If you want to make sure you're stupid, then go ahead. Seeing so much wealth today, I understand... ... why people are losing their lives for money. Gullu, have you ever seen so much wealth in one together? Are you talking about great wealth? I haven't even seen a part of it. You beggar! Fill your pockets and buy all the beauty of this world. Take it! Look at these diamonds! Those who have money rule the world. Right! We will cease to be beggars. We will live in royal mansions! Fools! Can you squeeze these diamonds and squeeze water out of them? Can you make food out of them? Who cares about food now? We will not eat these diamonds. You will have to eat and drink them. Why, master? “Because Gagool locked us up here and ran away. Come here! There is no point in going crazy. We are alive, which means fresh air comes from somewhere. So look for a place where the air comes from. We can get out of there. Go and seek. What will happen now? “Don't worry, Sunita. If trouble comes, you shouldn't give up. Have patience and courage. We will not be able to give up patience and courage... ... but someday life will end. Will you grant my one wish? - What? Promise me first. - I promise. Ranjit, I want to belong to you before I die. Really. Sunita, how lucky I am to receive your love. You dream of living in the kingdom of death. And in those dreams I see my life. Really. Wow! Wonderful. This is called true love! Ranjit, who knows if you get the chance to get married. Take my advice. Enjoy your honeymoon instead of getting married. As for the wedding party, I will try to arrange it. What did you do! Air! Air! Master, I can feel the air moving! Master, I've found where the air comes from. You found? - The air comes from there. Where from? - From there. Here. Hold me. Give me your hand so I can get out. What happened to you, Satish? Don't you get it? I'll explain it to you. Only I will get out of here, not you. What nonsense are you talking about? - I am stating a fact. You will stay here. Here you will die and rot! You have always stood as a wall between me and my desires. Today I will tear down this wall forever. I will remove this thorn tearing my heart and brain. You are a scoundrel! - Yes, I'm a scoundrel. Remember when I told you I was going to organize a wedding? So here's your take. Who are you? - I'm Zoro. Now you ask how I got here? I followed you. And you ask why. I came in search of the treasures that you left inside the mountain. I know that I will see these treasures today. We came from afar. How do you know we're looking for treasure? Only we knew this secret. Naive hunter, that was my plan. I had to put on this show to guide you along this path. I had to use Sunita. Yes, Ranjit, I had no other choice. They threatened to kill my father. My father is still in their custody. So the story about your brother was a lie? I do not have a brother. We have invented this story too. What is the point of wasting time on this nonsense now? Let's go to. Let's go to. “Be a gentleman, Ranjit. Even stones melt from women's screams. - Let her go! - Otherwise - what? Why are you stubborn, buddy? Decided to play a dangerous game? Pride is a very bad counselor. The ghost of the wealth of words will not understand. This is the law of the jungle, where 10 wolves hunt for prey. But the lion always hunts alone. He opened his blindfolds and violated our law of the jungle. And those who break the law are punished with death. Well done, friend. While you are here, you and your friends are my guests. Master, are you sleeping? Listen, I stole these diamonds. We'll go sell them in town... ... and you can buy all the beauty of this world.
