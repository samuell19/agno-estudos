(melancholy music) - Harry, I don't want to hear anymore. - If we don't go home soon, you're going to be sorry. - Harry, I am sick and tired of hearing you complain. - You keep saying there's one more thing. Five, five times ago, you said one more thing an hour ago. - Five, five, five times, what is it all night long? (melancholy music) - We're going to go down there. We're going to get on the subway and I'm going to go. - We are not, Harry, I won't. - If I have to go home by myself, I'll go home by myself. - I will not go home with you Harry. I'm not going home, I am not going home. - I don't care what else you do down here all night long. All I want to do is to go home. (melancholy music) - [Wife] Harry, I'm sick of your complaining. That's all you do, it's all you do, Harry. - [Harry] You're driving me crazy! - I am not leaving Harry, until we go on a ride. - I don't want to stay down at this place anymore. I want to get out of here, all I want to do is go home. - Harry, I am not going home. (melancholy music) I'm tired, I'm tired, I'm tired. (melancholy music) What, what am I supposed to do?

Something I don't know? - Well, they're moving me to a new office tomorrow. - Oh why? - Well they won't let the Assistant DA stay in the same old dingy quarters. - No. - I got the job yeah. - You're kidding! - No, I'm not kidding, no. - You got it! - Yeah. - You really got it? - Yeah. You're happy huh? - Yes. Oh baby this is good, I had no idea it was gonna be this soon I thought maybe six months. - They figured they couldn't do it without me I guess. Laura, did you lose this someplace? - No I don't have anything. - You sure? It fit? (soft romantic music) (merges into carnival music)Ãº - Just one more thing. - Come in, come in. I can see the past, the present, or the future. - Come on let's try it. - Come in. Sit down, let me read the lovely lady's palm. Come. - Alright. - Oh Harry, look at the flowers. - Yeah. - Stop yawning Harry. - I need something green. - [Wife] Green? Oh she means money Harry, she wants a dollar. - [Harry] Sure. - [Wife] It better be good for a dollar. - [Fortune Teller] I see a long life, a very long life. You will live 87 years. I see one or two very beautiful children and a handsome man. - Must be me. - Oh shut up Harry. - [Fortune Teller] I see that you like to work but you also like to play. - See what I've been telling you Harry? - You are a very demanding person. Your standards are very high, you want only the best. I see that some of your goals will come to pass, there will be some money but I can see no more in the palm, it's not clear, I must read the cards. - [Wife] Wait a minute, how much is that? - I need some more green. - How much I said. - Here. - [Fortune Teller] I need more, I need five dollars. - Five dollars, Harry! - Nevermind, you wanted to come. - Alright so I wanted to come but you know what we can do with five dollars, we could go see a movie Harry Alright, so what just because I spent five dollars on the kids and you always complain, just don't complain anymore. - Nevermind, I want to see. - Just remember Harry that's your bowling money. - I see that someone close to you is involved in a business venture. It has already begun. And it will probably succeed but... - What zippers? - The zippers dear, I told you Claire. - You didn't tell me anything about the zippers just wait until I get you home Harry. - [Fortune Teller] I see that there is some difficulty, some problem with a very close relative. - Your mother Harry. - [Fortune Teller] Now this is the card for today. I see, I see something strange. (dramatic music) I cannot tell the future anymore, I cannot read anymore cards. - [Claire] Wait a minute, we paid five dollars for this! - I want you to go home. - [Claire] We paid five dollars and I want that five dollars back! - [Harry] Come on Claire, let's go. - I advise you to take your wife and go home. - [Claire] I want that five dollars back! - [Harry] Nevermind Claire, let's get outta here. - [Claire] I want it back, that's a jip, I'll sue, I'll sue! - [Harry] Claire, you don't come with me right now you're gonna be sorry. Claire can we go home now? You said an hour ago we could go home and I'm tired. - Look, look, teddy bears, aw come on, they'd be cute for the kids. - No you got enough teddy bears. - Harry! You haven't done anything with me all night long and you wouldn't go on any rides. - We had hotdogs, we walked on the boardwalk. - Harry. - Don't worry about my stomach, my stomach's alright. - You're upset Harry. - No, I'm not upset. - I want that teddy bear Harry and we're not leaving here until I get it. - You want the teddy? - Yes Harry. - Try three darts for a quarter, what do you say buddy?

Lady he's got two more. Oh, very close. - Are you married? - No. - Don't get married, boy it was the biggest mistake of my life. - How did you get hampered with that one? - I don't know, it's a long story. - Breathe evenly, aim a little bit above the balloon and you'll hit em. - He wouldn't go on any rides with me. - Some guys are old fashioned. - You know that he said we'll get a night out without the kids, right, what have we done? We've done nothing, nothing. I know you can do it, I'm trying to get him to do it. - Stick with me and I'll win you a teddy bear. - He's got a bad stomach and he gets all upset. (dramatic instrumental music) Harry. - Three in a row. - He's been winning. - [Tom] Lady, if you lay off him maybe he'll have a better chance. You gotta take it easy. - Hey I got one, hey you see that, I got a balloon! Did you see that, I got a balloon! - Good eye Harry. - [Harry] I'm not excited! - Take it easy now, take it easy. Relax. - Five, my God, five! Five teddy bears! Oh wow, you know he can't even get any. Harry can't do anything, he sits in front of the TV and he can't do anything all night. - You've got your friend, I got my friend over here. He's helping me okay. - I'll remember that. You can't even hit a balloon and you can't hit it in bed. - Don't get started Claire. - Don't get started Claire. I'll remember that Harry, I won't be there at home tonight. I'm not going until you get one of those teddy bears. - Here you go lady, lady! - I've never been so humiliated in my life! - Now get her out of here will you? - I really appreciate it. - Harry I don't know what you're so goddamned tired about, we didn't go on anything all night long. - We were supposed to come down here for two hours and we've been down here all night. Now all I want to do is go home and go to bed. - Harry shut up and just give me your jacket, I'm cold. - Well if we went home you wouldn't need my jacket. - Would you stop, I knew you would say something like that. - Alright, alright, alright, take the jacket. - Here, you hold the teddy bear. - Claire, can we go home now? Let's just go down to the corner and get on the subway and go home. - Oh look, look, that looks like fun Harry, come on let's go on it. - Another ride? You've been on rides all night long. Claire, I'll make a promise to you. - Harry, I don't want to go home yet. - One ride. If we go on this ride can we go home? - Yes, we can go home. Lookit, all you do is sit down and you don't even go up and down. - One ride, one ride and we go home. Is that a promise? - Yes. - Alright, alright, alright. We'll go on the ride and we'll go home, okay. (laughing) (dramatic instrumental music) (screaming) (laughing) (dramatic instrumental music) (sirens wailing) (clown laughing) - Did you see her? She was a good looking chick too. You want to take her down or do you wanna go for lunch first? - Nah, put it in, put it in. (dramatic instrumental music) (phone ringing) - Hello? - [Dan] You're there. - Sure honey. - [Dan] I've been trying to call you for hours. - Oh, well after I got through teaching I stopped off to do some shopping. - [Dan] Laura, there was a murder over at the amusement park last night. - Yeah I heard that on the radio. That was pretty horrible wasn't it? - [Dan] It was. And the description in the papers sounded just like you. - Me? - [Dan] Laura, I don't want you to go out until I get there tonight. - Do I have to? - [Dan] Now look, that guy could be hiding in your hallway right now. - Don't say things like that. - [Dan] Promise me. - You can be so romantic. Okay, I'll stay here. - [Dan] That's better. You all ready for tonight? - I can't wait. Where are we gonna go? - [Dan] It's a surprise, you'll find out tonight. - Alright. See you later baby, love you. - [Dan] Love you too. (phone ringing) - Hello? - [Dan] It's me again. - Hi. - [Dan] Santini just came through here. - Your boss? - [Dan] My boss' boss. - Oh. - [Dan] Yeah, he says they're gonna put a DA on that murder next week. Even if they don't have a suspect, they're really going all out for this. - Does that mean you'll be on the case. - [Dan] Well, I might, I asked for it but there are a lot of guys ahead of me. - Oh baby, that would be fantastic. - [Dan] It would be a big break. - Oh I hope so. - [Dan] Laura, let's go over there tonight. - Where? - [Dan] To the amusement park. Maybe I can find out something that'll give me inside track in this case. - Dan, we were supposed to celebrate our engagement tonight. - [Dan] Well we can celebrate tomorrow night, I want to talk to people while the memories are fresh. - What do you need me for? - [Dan] I just want you with me. It's important, look I don't want people to think I'm just another cop, I need some camouflage. - But Dan you're not a cop. - [Dan] Please honey, it's really important. - But it could be dangerous. - [Dan] Honey, you'll be safer with me than home alone. - No I don't believe that. You said yourself he could be hanging around there. - [Dan] Laura, you've just got to trust me. - It's not that I don't trust you. Why do you want to put me in danger? - [Dan] Please, I need your help tonight. Will you come with me? - I don't want to spend my special night snooping around after a murderer. - [Dan] Is that all you can say? - Dan, you're crazy to go near that place. - [Dan] I don't care I'm going! - Dan, please! - [Dan] Good bye. (knocking) - [Laura] Who is it? - [Tom] It's Tom. - Hi, I'll get you coffee. - Thank you. How are you? - Just great. - [Tom] How's school? - Still there. - [Tom] Laura. - What? - [Tom] Is something the matter? - No, nothing's wrong. Oh! (shattering) - Well, I'm glad nothing's wrong. I'd hate to see the kitchen if there were something wrong. Now, what happened? - I had a fight with Dan. - When? - Just now. - Why? - Because he wants me to go to the amusement area with him to investigate that murder. - Well, so what? - We were supposed to go out tonight to celebrate our engagement. - Laura, are you engaged? Oh my, oh that's great! - Was great. - Nevermind the coffee, come on. Okay, what happened, did you holler at him? - A little. - Did he holler at you? - Yes. - You shouldn't fight Laura. You and Dan shouldn't fight, it's bad. My folks fought all the time, all the time. - Mine didn't get along that well either. - So where is Dan? - Probably on his way to the amusement area. - Well why don't you go meet him? - That was a horrible murder, I'm frightened I could get killed. - No. - Yes. - But you'll be with Dan and you always know where to find me. - You'll be at your stand, who knows where the murderer will be. - That maniac is probably 100 miles from here by now. - He could be somebody who works there, who knows? - Forget about it. Hey, come on over, meet Dan and come by the stand. I've got something for you. - You do? - Something very special but I won't tell you what it is until you get there, it's a surprise. - You're sweet Tom. - I got to go, I'm late for work. Will you come? - I'll think about it. - Okay, bye bye Laura. - Bye Tom. (soft instrumental music) (knocking) Who is it? - [Dan] It's me. (soft romantic music) - Dan! (soft romantic music) (clown laughing) Oh, we've got to go see Tom. - Alright, we'll go see Tom before he takes off. - No, no, we got to go see Tom now. - Why? - Because you know we had that fight before, and he knew about it. - Wait a minute, how'd he know about it? - Well he happened to come in for a visit and I was crying so I told him what happened. - You mean you blabbed our private affairs all over the... - Just Tom, he's a good friend, you know that. Anyway he was really upset and he wants us to come by and show him that we're together again. So let's do that for him, okay?

Good luck to you, take care of yourself. - Goodbye Gimpy. - Have a good time in the park, so long kids. - Good bye. - Bye bye. (laughing) - She's nice Tom. - She's a nice girl. He's a nice guy too. - Well what now? - Well I think we ought to go to the fortune teller now. - Down to business huh? (popping) - [Sailor's Date] You hit something else. (drunken mumbling) - You've led a very interesting life. I see that in the past there's been some unhappiness but lately it has improved. I see that quite some time ago people that were very close to you tried to keep you from expressing yourself but you have such strong character that you were able to overcome this. You have an artistic nature. You surround yourself with children. - That's right. - You're kind, you love animals. This ring, you do not have it for a long time. And there's some unhappiness connected with it, but the grief that was caused will soon disappear. I see someone connected with your life but his intentions are not very clear, they're very dim. I can't see anymore in the hand. - [Dan] Try won't you? - We try the cards eh. I see an advantageous marriage but the person is not clear. You must be very careful, there is someone out to do you harm so you must be very careful in choosing your friends. I see that there will be many problems and they will be caused by the opposite sex. (dramatic instrumental music) I can't tell you anymore, I can't go on anymore. I can't read the cards anymore. - [Dan] What do you mean? - I can't read the cards anymore. - [Laura] What do you see? - I see nothing, I can't read the cards anymore. Please leave me alone, I don't feel well. - What problem were you talking about? - [Fortune Teller] There is no problem. Please, just take your money, please and go. Please take her home. Please take her home, I really, I don't feel well anymore. I can't read the cards anymore. - Thank you. (clown laughing) - I want to go on the other one. - Dan, leave me out of this one please. - C'mon, I want to get a look at the inside. - This is where she got killed last night. - I know that, that's why I want to go in there. C'mon. (clown laughing) (dramatic instrumental music) (screaming) (clown laughing) - Come in, come in. - You heard the lady, let's have your fortune told. - Who is this? Come in, come in. (thudding) (drunken mumbling) - Come on, the lady's waiting. - [Fortune Teller] The young man would like me to read his palm? - The young man can't even sit up straight. Are you gonna sit up or are you gonna fall down again like a donkey. - I'm not a donkey. - That's my teddy bear. - [Fortune Teller] C'mon, I read the palms for one dollar, one dollar. - Where's your money? C'mon, the lady wants to read your palm. Aren't you going to give the nice lady a dollar? - What are you doin'? - Hurry up, the lady doesn't have all day. C'mon, c'mon. Here, one dollar. - One dollar. Now let's have the palm. Ah yes, I see a very adventurous life, very adventurous. And I see that you have had many ocean voyages. I see here that there has been a disaster at sea and you were injured but you have recovered very nicely. I see here many people, many ports, and I see many women. I see many women in every port. - Hey, I got a wife, I'm a married man. - Yes yes, I see the wife but she seems to be very far away. - I got a wife, I got a wife. - I see four little ones. And that is all I can see in the palm, I must read the cards. Five dollars for the cards. - Five dollars. Come on. Are we playing cards? - She's gonna play cards. - [Fortune Teller] I see that there is wealth and high social position and I see that you have great influence over your friends. I see there is a charming young lady in your life and she's not very far away. And that's all. I'm finished, it is over. - [Sailor's Date] What do you mean finished? - It is over, I've read the future, it is over. Good night. - What do you mean? What about my future. (laughing) Let's get out of here. - [Fortune Teller] Go home. - C'mon sailor. Catch me, catch me if you can. C'mon. (laughing) (waves crashing) - You forgot the bear I won you. - I left it at the horror house. - I'll go and get it. - Wait, I don't want to stay by my... - You'll be alright, stay here. I'll be right back. - Dan. - I'm not going anymore. (laughing) (screaming) Let go, let go, let go! (crying) Oh come on. Please! C'mon, please, please. - Come here. (waves crashing) (dramatic instrumental music) - Hey, wait for me. (dramatic instrumental music) Sailor! Sailor! Hey, sailor! Baby. (screaming) (dramatic instrumental music) - The horror house is closed up. - Dan, I heard a scream a few minutes ago. Did you hear it? - No. - I was afraid to go myself. - Where, up here? - Yeah, somebody might be hurt, let's go. - C'mon. Hello, are you alright? - What is it? (gasping) (screaming) - What do you say, try your luck. Break two balloons you win a prize. Where have you been Gimpy? - To get change Tom. - You can't get change this time of night. Where the hell did you go? - You left me alone for too long. - You're not supposed to leave the stand when I'm not here. You got that? - You're not supposed to leave me alone. - Where'd you get that? - You left me alone. - Did you take this bear with you? - I'll put it back. - That was the last blue bear. I gave that away this afternoon, where did you get that Gimpy? - I got it from the back room. - That's a lie Gimpy, where did you get the bear? - I got it in the back room. - Gimpy, tell me where you got the bear. (crying) Gimpy. Gimpy, Gimpy, please. Please Gimpy calm down. You okay now? - The people make fun of me. Threw money at me. - Yeah, I know Gimpy, I'm sorry I left you. - I'm just supposed to clean up and not talk to people. - Yeah, okay, I'm sorry Gimpy, I really am. Are you okay now? C'mon Gimpy I'll tell you what, let's close up the store and we'll go to my place okay. We'll have a beer, would you like that? - You're not mad? - No, I'm not mad anymore, I'm sorry that I left you alone. Come one, let's close up and go to my place, what do you say? - Take me to your house? - Yeah, we'll have a drink, okay? - I've never been. - Come on, we'll close up the stand now and we'll go along okay? - I'll clean up in the morning. - Fine. Come on in Gimpy. - It's nice here. - Oh thanks, sit down. - You have teddy bears and dolls from work. - Yeah, you want a beer? - Yes. They're nice, they look pretty. - Some of them are like old friends. - You live here by yourself Tom? - Yup. Here you go. Cheers to you. Oh boy, it's been a long day. - We were busy at the end. - Lot of people. It was a good weekend. I'll be glad when the summer's over. - I guess I'll be sad that it gets cold. - Yeah. - I stay in the stand and take care of it in the wintertime, right Tom. - You can if you want to but it's real cold there, there's no heat or nuthin'. - It'd be nice, there'd be nobody there and everything and I'll keep everything repaired. - Don't you have a family, anyone to go to? - I have no mother, but I had a dog. - What kind? - He was all different colors and he was good and nice but I had to kill him. - Why? - I had to kill him Tom. - [Tom] Why? - He was, I had to kill him. And you shouldn't. I feel bad so. - Oh. Hey Gimpy, there's something I've been wondering about. What's your real name? - Gimpy. - Come on, nobody's called Gimpy. What's your name? - Mister Gimpy (laughs). Gimpy. (laughing) Tom, you have a girlfriend that stays with you here? - No I don't have a girlfriend. - [Gimpy] You've got a nice house, and you're a good man and you got money. - I don't have any girlfriends, what do you mean? That's crazy. - Oh, you got a girl. She comes to see you. - Laura? Yeah, she's a good friend right, she just lives downstairs, she's a good friend. She's not a girlfriend though. These are my friends, some of my very special friends. Hi there. - [Gimpy] You need a real live one. - No I don't. - Are you mad that I... - Just one thing Gimpy. Sometimes you get so mad, so mad at the customers, you can't do that. - You leave me alone in the stand and I clean it. - I don't mean that Gimpy, I don't mean when I'm away, I mean when I'm there, I've seen it happen. You get so mad and so violent, almost crazy, you can't do that, you scare 'em away. - Sometimes you stand by yourself and they laugh and you don't say nothin' and they whistle and they laugh and some of the women... - I know sometimes they're really terrible, I know what you mean, I feel the same way. But we can't scare 'em off, they're customers Gimpy. You got to stop that, you gotta control yourself otherwise you're doing fine, you're doing great. I'm happy to have you. - You sure that you like the way I work? - Yeah I do. You're taking good care of the stand, you haven't let me down. I'm proud of you. You just gotta take it easy with the people. - I try to be very good. It's gettin' late. - Yeah, it sure is. - I'd better go, I gotta... - Why don't you stay here tonight? There's plenty of room. We can go in tomorrow and organize the stand. Would you like that? - In your house? Tom I'm dirty and not too clean. - Don't worry about it, there's plenty of room. What about it, do you want to stay? - I'd love to stay tonight, I'd stay right on the floor. - Well there's plenty of room, it'll be alright. - I can clean up too if you... - Nah, it isn't necessary. We'll just take it easy tonight, we'll go in, we'll open up the stand tomorrow okay? - Oh Tom, you're nice, a nice man. - Why so charming and beautiful lady like you so unhappy? Come in, let me tell your fortune. Come in, let me read your palm. Just one dollar to read the palm. - One dollar? It says 25 cents. - I read your palm. - You know how to tell cards too? - Of course I know how to read the cards too. - What do you charge for both palm and the cards? - One dollar for the palm, five dollars for the cards. But for you I make special, five dollars for both. - Uh uh, I only got two bucks to spend on both. - Four. - I'm only gonna spend three. - No four. - Three and a quarter. - No four, for four dollars I tell you the whole future. - You really know how to do both huh? - For both the palm and the cards. - You really know? - I am a fortune teller. - Three fifty. - Alright, three fifty, three fifty. - Okay. - Let me see your hand. Maybe you better give me the money first eh. - Oh boy, what kind of a place is this? Every place you go you gotta shell out. Take it easy, you'll get it. One, two, three, fifty. - I see that you are a lady of very discriminating taste and I see that you have been very badly misjudged by your friends, very unjust. - [Customer] You can say that again. - There are many uncharitable tongues wagging against you. - You can say that again. - [Fortune Teller] And I can see that you are very generous, very kind, almost to a fault because people take advantage of you. I think there has been some unhappiness in the past. Perhaps a marriage, a husband, a husband, he is not here anymore eh? - You're damn right he isn't. - You were very wise because he was not worthy of your qualities, not at all.

He came in and deliberately tried to frighten me after I was already so hysterical from last night. And then he wanted me to come back again. Again. To go look for that murderer. No understanding, no sympathy. He has no idea what it is to love. All he wants is a woman he can use as camouflage so he can go prancing around... - Did you try to understand him Laura? - Oh yes I did. - Well you didn't try very hard did you? - I beg your pardon. I was the one who gave in that relationship. He was the one who took. Took, took, took, that's all he could do. Everything in that house that reminds me of him, gone. - Everything? - Yup. - Laura, the bear. Laura, what did you do to the bear? - Took my black poster paint. Obliterated it. - You're just like all the others aren't you? You're selfish, think only of yourself. It's the only thing you know anything about is what you want. Selfish, demanding. - [Gimpy] Tom! - You'll destroy everything that doesn't suit you, that doesn't go your way. Destructive, selfish, slut! - [Gimpy] Laura. We like Laura. - I gotta get out of here. - Tom, not Laura, you don't wanna do Laura.
