Your close friend is waiting there. Who? Mr. Sivam, sir. Yes, come in! -Keep the coffee on the table. -What coffee? I thought I had heard this voice somewhere. -Aras, welcome. -Now you're calling me by my name. Why did you register my name as "Anbarasu" at the reception? Why? It's your full name. I don't like "Anbu" as that means love. Sir, you shouldn't dislike it. "Those who don't love are selfish. Those who love…" Wow! Can you speak in Odia Language as well? What are you saying? It's Tamil, sir. Mr. Thiruvalluvar! White beard… Mylapore man near Sanskrit college. -It's a statue-- -Don't bore me. -I have had a really bad day! -Sorry. I'm very angry that… Shall I say one thing? I know what're you going to say. You're going to ask me one thing. I know what're you going to ask me. I want to ask you as to why you are chasing me. I didn't ask that to you. Then, what else will I ask? You'll ask about it. I kept it in my front pocket like a Kangaroo and got it safely for you. You might've suffered a lot without this. You don't need to thank me. You can make a call here itself. Is it a personal call? Is it a love call? No. I too don't have a leg and a hand. Nonsense! Hi, handsome! After taking bath I'm looking a bit handsome. Sorry, I kept them outside-- I just placed my leg on the table. Thank you. You returned my phone and I returned your bags. Let's end this. Why is it smelling bad in here? -I was-- -Is it coming from you? Take a bath. I want to make a call. Sir, you can make a call later. Or else, you won't get to bath with hot water. Okay. -Hello, Mr. A Aras has gone for his bath-- -Hey, give me that! -Sir, what's all this? -I didn't call your full name-- I know it! That's not important. Did I enter the bathroom? Can't I attend the call? Sir, is this a public call? I know that it's my office. Why didn't you call me from your house? Did they make a call? Missed calls? Ask them to call me again. Okay. -You received missed calls-- -Sir, there were four missed calls. You get angry when I handle your cell in your presence. How can I take your calls in your absence? Four missed calls. -Sir, who is Sarasu? -She is my… How do you know it? I read "Sarasu" on the mobile screen. Sir, who's she? Do you want to know everything? I don't know much. I'll take bath and come. Why are you taking that? Take this towel. -The hot water shower-- -Thank you very much! I'll manage. What I mean is when I opened it… Sir, why you hang it like this? It's a traditional underwear. Why have you hanged it like a party flag? I thought I could at least wash that. Sir, you put it aside. -How? -With your hand. It's washed. You put it aside and take bath. Oh, God. The shower nozzle is a bit-- Oh, God! I've taken shower bath several times. I didn't mean that. -That shower nozzle is-- -Hey, I'll manage! Leave me alone! -What was the noise? -Sir, nothing. I kicked the bloody bucket, man! Why did you shout after kicking the bucket? Oh, God! Sir, I've kicked the bucket. Do you've to cross examine me for everything? Sorry. -Yeah, just a minute. -May I come in, sir. Come in. What is it? -Sorry, sir. Coffee-- -Yeah, pour it on my head. I was opening the door. Why did you ask him to come in? When he asked if he could come in, that's all I can answer, right? Sir, the shower nozzle fell on your head, right? You lied about kicking the bucket. Sir, why didn't you inform me about it earlier? Sir, I wanted to tell you. You didn't let me speak by saying that you were taking shower. Then we were talking about my underwear. I tried to warn you but you didn't listen to me and got hurt. -Sign it, sir. -You can give thousands of excuses. You're an expert at that. Sir, you've got a big lump on your head. Sir, it's alright. I don't mind getting hit -but bleeding is a problem. -Why? It's because my blood group is AB -ve which is difficult to get. I know. I am O +ve. I… oh! Are you of the same blood group? You said AB -ve. I'm AB -ve and you're O +ve but what I mean is… Bloody confusion! Phone. Hello. Hi, honey. Aras here. Yes, here there's cyclone and heavy floods. The trains and planes are canceled. Please! What could I do? I didn't have my cell phone with me. It's not cyclone but a pillow. It's a fellow. No, it's-- It's a fellow with a pillow. That cyclone is better than this. Wait a minute. He is a very nice gentleman. I met him here. He's a pain in my neck. He asks questions and gives suggestions for everything. He is irritating me in the name of help. Hello. Hello! Will you call on the landline number? Wait, I'll give you the number. It's a God forsaken hotel! Hello, open the door. Open the door! Yeah, please! I can't tell you. He's a joker. Not a rummy joker. He's a real joker. How can you talk like him? -Oh, God! -Sir! Sir! Thank God! Swim and come out. I can't swim! Sir, won't you speak in Tamil even while you're dying? -I can't swim! -That's how you say it. Hold this and come out. A talented person can make use of a pillow as well. Is that all necessary now? -Sorry, sir. I feel very sorry. -Is it because I didn't die? Sir, don't talk like that. Just think about it. You were sorry that you didn't get a room in a five-star hotel. Had you got it, the room could've been on the fifth or sixth floor. -If you had fallen-- -Sir, won't you ever think positively? I didn't mean that. Sorry. Sir, don't plug it. The micro processors might be wet. The petrol pumps also suggest to switch off the cell phone because it can cause fire. Sir, you claim to know everything and I don't! -I didn't mean that. -Let me do my work. Go ahead. You give your opinion and suggestion for everything. I mean there is a limit to everything! Am I a child to be advised all the time? Sir, don't I know about electronics? I have used and charged my cell phone so many times! -I-- -Don't utter a word. Don't laugh. It happens man. -Hello. -Hello, please tell me. I want to make a very urgent call to Chennai. Sorry, sir. You can't make a call. -What? Can't I make a trunk call? -No! -Messaging? -No, sir. -Email? -No, sir. -Telegram? -No. Then how? -Dove. -Dove? What do you mean? -Pardon me. Hello? -Very funny! -Thank you. -Hello. We'll become old by the time we reach Chennai. -Sir, only now, I'm happy. -Why? You've sense of humor. But, I don't know, whether I can smile or not? Can I smile? Only couples come to this hotel? They've kept only one bed. Now, we've share this and… Sir, I didn't mean that… You tell me where do you want to sleep & I… No…I'll sleep on the floor. Because I have a bad back. In the spinal cord, there's a slip disk… I should sleep only on the hard surface. -That's why… -Are you sure you want to-- -Are you okay? -Yeah. -Are you sure you are okay? -Yeah. Okay, then. Good night, Mr. Sivam. -Oh, no! -What happened? Unbelievable man! -What? -I mean the cyclones, rain and winds. These are common in Orissa. People face them every year. Every year they say it will hit Chennai. But, it hits only Orissa and Andhra. Sir, you can see huge waves here. Sir, you can see a tsunami here. Do you know what a tsunami is? -I know the meaning of tsunami. -What is it? It's a big wave. No, it's rather a big mountain. You've studied abroad, right? Sir, tell me the height of the Liberty Statue. -300 feet. -Yeah, very good. Why do you say "very good" for everything? Sir, it's just an appreciation of your knowledge. You said the height of the Liberty Statue is 300 feet, right? It seems the waves will be 250 feet high. -In Orissa? -Yes, sir. -That's what I have heard. -Impossible. I have heard about it but we can find a wave about 50 feet high in Danushkodi. Sir, don't you think it's over exaggeration? No, it's not. Such a wave swept away my father. What do you mean? I mean, it swept away my father. My father loved photography. He asked me to click his snap with the swell of the wave. He said "It will look nice." We got a good photo and the wave. And my dad got swept away. What do you mean by that? We didn't even get his body. It means he died, right? I am sorry, Mr. Sivam. Excuse me, I would like a first class train ticket to Chennai, please -via Coromandel Express. -All trains are canceled. -What? -Canceled! Excuse me! I am a taxpayer! You are answerable to me. Tell me one good reason why I can't take the train to Chennai. What is this… Is it a railway station or a harbor? What? Nothing. Time? -It's a bad time. -Time. Hey, stop! Thief! Police! Emergency! Ambulance-- Hey, stop! Hey! Hey, stop! Thief! Oh God! I don't know how to swim. Hey, stop him! He is running away with my purse! He is looting me! He is-- Hey, stop! Give me my purse! Don't try to beat me! We will talk and settle the matter. Hey! Hey, stop! Cash-- Hey, stop! -Wait! What if he doesn't know English? -Is it very important? -He has taken away my purse. -Isn't this your purse? He has taken the cash. Is it enough? Is there no policeman or a police station here? -The railway station itself is submerging. -Yes, how can a police station exist! I think it's in that corner. Sir, please-- Hey, don't touch my bag! Wait. He's from this town. He'll bring the bag safely. How do you know that he's not a thief? Sir, I'm not a thief. I'm an old friend of comrade. He's my friend, Misro. This is Aras. -Bag-- -Sorry, I mistook you for a thief. It's alright. I feel sorry that you lost your money in our town. No problem! Thank God I still have my credit card. -That bag-- -What happened to the bag? Wait! Let it be there. We'll go and take it. You go. We will bring this bag-- -This bag? -We'll bring this bag. Don't laugh! I am very new to all this. I have never seen thieves. Are we friendly with thieves? People at the hotel would have told you if there was an availability of train or not. At least you could've asked me. Was I in such a deep sleep that you couldn't wake me up? We wouldn't have got this bag if he wasn't there. -Thanks. -Why are you making it a big issue? Sir, it's a big thing. How much money do I have in this bag? Sir, I don't know but I know how much money I had. I had 4,000 rupees and it got stolen. Thank God! He left the credit card. I've 32 lakhs in this bag. It's true, sir. You tell him. In Orissa, 100 Tamilians died when the dam broke. He argued in the court with the help of our union. And he has finally got the compensation. He's going to handover the cheque. -It's very rare to see such a person. -Tell me the details. I didn't argue but the lawyer did. I'm just taking the cheque to them. But it would have taken a year if Mr. Misro was not here without knowing Oriya language. Oh, God! Look where the car is! It would've been thrown up there by the floods. Let's go. -Do you know him? -No, I don't. Let's go. -Do you've any sisters? -No. Don't worry. What are you saying? -Why are you abusing? -What are you saying? He doesn't have any sisters. In that case, he shouldn't abuse you. That's technically wrong. -That's why I-- -Is it very important? Don't laugh! It's insulting. Yes, your town is very bad. We don't know what he is saying. If we go to Andhra and go straight to Tamil Nadu, then we can at least understand their abuses. It's very funny. I've 15 rupees and you have five rupees. How do we go? -And that too till Orissa border! -We can go by bus. Sir, how can we go with this amount? We'll get a seat for this money. Come with me. Sir, the man next to me is having tobacco. Ask him to either have tobacco or stop playing the flute. Why? I'm getting showered with tobacco through the flute. It's very unhygienic. You should be one of the crowd in the public place. How can you change things as per your liking? -This is a world and not a TV set. -I know the world. I know people. Don't try to teach me everything. I have traveled a lot and I am friendly as well. Hi! Aras here. Are you okay? See! Will you eat this? -Have it. -Oh! Thank you. -Ask him not to eat. -Don't eat it. -Don't-- -What? I've eaten in North Indian roadside eateries. No problem. I have got a very good immune system and my health is also very good. Do you have one more? You shouldn't have more of it! It will make you dizzy! -What? -Head! Is he saying something about my mother or scolding me? He'll feel dizzy. He means that you will feel dizzy and faint. You don't know the language. I don't know the language but I know about that drug. Drug? Is it like heroine or narcotics? It's a ball made out of cannabis paste. Oh! What will happen if I eat this? Now that you have had it, you will know it. Buddy, you've gone crazy And you have lost your sense What happened to me? I feel the butterflies Are fluttering in my mind Your are high as the American dollars Our brains have come down Like Indian rupees When we get high Knowledge gets increased Once you get back to normal Your knowledge will decrease as well Buddy, you've gone crazy And you have lost your sense We should've some kick in life Or else, we won't have strength Mother's milk and liquor Make you feel high You're not clever enough to Differentiate between them Mother's milk makes you high For few months But the kick of liquor will Remain for our entire life The tipsy feeling may change Will your mind change? Can a dog's tail ever be straightened? Buddy, you've gone crazy And you have lost your sense My chickens! Chicken! What? -My chickens! -I've a credit card. I don't want your money. What do you want? Life is a treasure trove The strongest one will take it Is it wrong to be selfish? Don't usurp his livelihood If a worker sleeps with an empty stomach This country will be ruined You're an excellent debater You seem to be a lawyer's relative You're mesmerizing me with your words You're selling ice cubes in the Himalayas Buddy, you've gone crazy And you have lost your sense What happened to me? I feel the butterflies Are fluttering in my mind Hey, sit down. Look over there. -What do you want? -Sit down. Oh, God! Be careful. Oh, God! He got hurt. -Do you've stomach ache? -No, I'm feeling hungry. You've ordered so many items. Have you hidden the money somewhere? Citi bank card, master card, visa card, Hong Kong Bank card. I've all the credit cards. We can eat anything and anywhere all across India. This is not valid only in your bus. After eating that thing in the bus… Do you accept credit cards? Do you want a sweet? He's unaware of credit cards. He is asking me if I want a sweet. Shall we inform him? No. He has got sober and is trying to eat. Let him eat. But what about the cash? Nothing. You do one thing. You take your own time. I'll finish off my work. I don't know why but I'm continuously laughing and feeling hungry. Your bill. Sorry. What is this? I need money. What? It seems, he won't accept credit card. He wants cash payment. You should've told me earlier! Excuse me! No cash, only card. I don't care about all that. -You can't leave if you don't pay me. -What did he say? He said he won't allow you to go without getting the cash. Why don't you allow me to go out? I just need my money. You should have put up a board stating it. -Why didn't you do it? -I won't let you go. -What're you talking? -I need money. -I will not let you go. -I will not spare you! -Give me the money. -I said that I don't have money. -Give me the money. -You want cash? Here is the cash. -Thank you, Mr. Sivam. -Okay. How much should I pay you? You don't have to give anything. What's this? How did you get this cash? We'll talk about it outside. Come on. -Come on. -Thank you, Mr. Sivam. I won't forget this. My shoe… Sir, my shoes are missing. Sir, my shoes are missing. They've stolen my shoes. What type of hotel is this? I'm going to call the police. -Shoes-- -My shoes are missing. -Sir, don't shout. -What is it? You ate food, right? It was because of your shoes. Here is the balance. -Thank you. -Okay. Wow! Excellent. Mr. Sivam, I'm walking without shoes. Are you an army officer that you're polishing your shoes? -Not polishing. I'm washing them. -Wash? Sir, wait. Italian designer shoe! They were worth 10,000 rupees. Both of us will walk without shoes. Listen! Don't you ever touch my things again! Okay? Okay! You're acting too much. Did your leg split into two by my touch? Sir, wait. One of my legs had become short in an accident. Not only yours is a designed shoe. My shoe is also designed for me. Yours is Italian but mine is designed in the hospital. I am really sorry, Mr. Sivam. -I'll-- Thank you, Misro. -Thanks. I am really sorry, Mr. Sivam. -Wait. Keep it down. -Sorry, Misro. -Why are you apologizing to me? -That's right. Sir, I'm very confused. Will any fool go to Bhubaneswar to see a location when he's about to get married? Who's that fool? And who's getting married? I am going to Bhubane-- Sir, I'm the fool-- I'm the one who's going to get married. Wow! Congratulations! -Let's see if it happens. -Don't worry. Comrade will take you safely to your place. Go straight and catch the Coromandel express. -You'll reach Chennai. 17 hours! -Where are you going? My town is nearby. I'll take leave. -Bye. Bye, comrade. -Bye. Okay, bye. -Where are you going? -I'm not going anywhere. Don't forget your shoes. How can I forget it? I'll first wear socks and then put them on. Let's both of us wear our shoes and leave. We'll go together but, how will you wear my shoes? Will we wear one each? -Wow! You're smiling! -Sorry, sir. I didn't appreciate your joke as I was tense. Not only that, after taking that cannabis… I feel like crying when I hear jokes. Yes. You wear your shoes. I've another pair. I'll wear that. Then we'll go together. Sir, is there any train to Chennai from here? -Coromandel will come. -Will it stop here? It will stop. How long will it stop? "Two to two to two two." No, sir. How long will the Coromandel train stop here? -"Two to two to two two." -No. Please stop joking. Please tell me. How long will the Coromandel train… stop here! "Two to two to two two!" -I got it. -What? "Two to two to two two." Get lost. He says that it will stop from 1:58 a.m. to 2:02 a.m. -Two to two-- -To two two! Oh you mean… He can't get it. Explain to him. -That's what he means to-- -I got it. Listen! Are you sure the train will… come? -Are you sure it will come? -Who can give surety? -Sir, I have a question. -Tell me. -Do you have a telephone? -I want to ask him something. Excuse me! -Is there a phone I can use? -Wait! He asked first. Yes, sir. There is a telephone. Okay. -Can I make a-- -Please let me go first. See I have to make this really important personal call. You two decide between you two. -Why? -I can just permit one call. -But why? -Because I am the station master. -What's your name? -Sivam. -What's your name? -Jesus Christ!

It's about love. How did you find it? I can read your eyes. Are you so experienced? Why not? Shouldn't I've had the experience of falling in love? You can. But you falling in love… Can I not have experience in love? Definitely. I mean… After all, every dog has his day and… they say love is blind, so… I was about to tell something else but… I am sorry. I didn't mean that. So… When did you first meet? You mean the dog? Where did you first meet your girl? In the middle of the street with my music band. -Let me guess. -Go ahead. In a temple festival? In a marriage procession? What were you doing? I was spreading a message. Oh! So you were a postman. Messenger service? Messenger… You can say that. Even Jesus Christ was a messenger.

We'll get thrashed if we fail to market it. What're we going to import? Tea! Tea. -What? -Tea. Hello, commissioner. That's okay. What's the margin of profit? That's it? The multinational companies won't pay you much. We will get 40% and 60% will be given to him. Then, what about the plight of local tea producers? Let them to go the hell. Our foreign investors are more important to us. The profit we get in the process is more important. In a game of chess, proprietors make their move. Will a worker remain a mute spectator? Or will they keep watching the fun silently? Even if shore wants to rest, the waves will never allow it. They will not! Even if trees want to take rest, the air will not allow it. It will not!

An arrogant heroine and a revolutionary hero. Nice story. It's new! It's not a story. It's my life. Yes, it's your life. Bala is not an arrogant girl. -Excuse me. -It's okay, you didn't mean it. Even I came to the same conclusion when I first saw her. Only when I met her the second time… Do you know where I met her the second time? I and Mehr-- Be careful. -You be careful, lady. -Am I a lady? If I'm a boy wearing pant and shirt then you are a lady wearing a skirt. Why are you fighting with the people walking on the road? That's why I told you that I'll drive. You behave like a man but you feel shy to sit behind a woman on a bike, right? -Hey, did I say that? -Come on, say that. Why are you beating around the bush? You drive. Nothing like that. You can-- -Hey! Are you blind? -Hey! Oh God! He has stopped the car and is coming back. It must be an MLA's car. We're going to get beaten up. I am very sorry, sir. Nalla. Mr. Madan, you've painted me. Why don't you give me an autograph? -Terribly sorry, Nalla. -You said that already. -He is Mr. Madan. She is Meher. -Greetings. She's in our troupe. -She is also an architect. -What about that gentleman? Hey, what's it? -What's your plan for dinner? -I will have it at home. We're discussing. Go. It's water everywhere. These people add glamor to our state. -Okay. Let's go. -Where? To dine. -My dress is soiled. -Then I'll also stand here. -Driver, splash it on me. -No, sir. Then what? Come with me. -But where? -Suspense. But, the food will be delicious. -Greetings, sir. -Are the dogs chained? Yes, they are. Shut up, Tommy! -Hello, Bala. -How are you? -Fine. -This is my aunt. Greetings. -Yes. -Come. -Let me introduce you to my friends. -Thank you. Hello. -This is Felix. -Hello. -Hello, Mr. Felix. -Hello. This is Manohar. Uncle, check whether the dinner is ready or not? Okay. -Why are they here? -You wait here. He's inside. -You don't want them? -Yeah. Stop. Why are you here? Whom do you want to meet? Cartoonist Madan invited us here-- There is no one like that. Get out. Sir, he had only invited us. Okay, it's alright. Hello, sir! They're my guests. -Your guests? Welcome. Get in. -Okay. Come on, Nalla. Nalla, you were following me. Why were you late? You came by car but we came by a two-wheeler. There are many dogs in this house. Ask everyone to come for the dinner. -Thank you. -Excuse me. -Come, let's have dinner. -Come, Nalla. She's waiting for us. Hello, Mr. Madan. Hello, Mr. Ranjith. Wait a minute. Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen. Excuse me! I would like you to meet my father, Mr. Kandasamy Padayachi. You've come to the lion's den. How dare you twist your whiskers? I'm just thinking about Mr. Padayachi dancing to our folk beat. And that's my father, Kandasamy Padayachi. Greetings. Greetings to everyone. Who's she? She's with me. Sorry, I'm… -Mehrunnissa. -Oh! All religions are equal in my house. What do you say? Yes. Hail Lord Siva's mercy. Dad, Mr. Madan is here. Welcome. Bala was anxiously awaiting your arrival since morning. Boss, the one who's wearing a green shirt is Mr. Madan. Don't I know that? Mr. Madan, I'm busy with my business all the time. I can't remember faces. You've grown a beard all of a sudden. -That's why I couldn't-- -Oh, God. -Since when you started sporting beard? -I was always with a beard. It's looks good. Look, don't be in a hurry to catch the train. The train won't start until you board the train. Relax and enjoy your feast. -Okay Mr. Madan, see you. -Won't you join us in the feast? -Hail Lord Siva! -Boss is on a fast today. I won't have water as well. You carry on. Dear, take care of him. Okay. You never introduced me to them. -He's my father-in-law. -Greetings. Retired magistrate. -Did you eat? -No. -This dish was prepared by you. -Thanks. -Bring the other dishes. -Okay. -That's great. -Oh. Oh, my God! Grandpa, what have you done? Someone please come and clean it fast. -No need. Go that side. -Sorry. Forgive me. It's alright, Grandpa. I am so sorry! Don't worry. Accidents happen. I was talking to him. It's alright. Why do you get upset for such trivial things? Nalla, come here. She has put a painting on the dining table. No, Mr. Madan. She doesn't agree but the painting is only visible to us. -Even we can see that. -Oh, sorry. -What do you see? -This is a fish and that's a horse. -What do you see? -I see many things, sir. I think Nalla is getting into the mode. Come on, Nalla. -We can put a vermilion. -Beautiful. -What can we do with the goat? -We can only make soup out of it. -Please accept this cup. -Oh! Wow! That's a great piece of improvisation. -Can I take a photograph of that? -Why not? Okay, you want more height? -But you-- -You will need more height. Yes. How do I change it? Here you go. -Wow! -Wow! -Beautiful. -Hats off. It's nice. -Where is the bathroom? -It's over there. If that's not enough then-- What do you want me to do? 910 rupees is a good salary. That's why, I'm telling you to increase the salary by 100 rupees. They'll keep quiet for the next two years. If we keep on revising their pay, then our grandchildren will become poor. They'll be workers. I mean to say that if we don't increase their salaries, they'll call for strike. What can they do? We'll announce the lockout ahead of them. But, that's our hidden power. We've to keep it a secret. Will government let us to announce lockout? They'll support workers. They'll pretend as if they're supporting them. Who's offering them foreign exchange? We got it for them. Do workers give them? Can you guarantee us that government will not create any problem? Why not? We can go in for a one time settlement with the politicians. But we can't manage them with monthly doles. Government will declare this strike as illegal. I assure you that. Until I am alive, workers will get a salary of 910 rupees only. I'll not raise even a penny. Even you people shouldn't raise it. What's the noise there? Nothing. Your daughter is hosting a party for artists downstairs. It must be one amongst them. What's the noise? All doors are alike. I was not able to find the bathroom. You could've asked me. Go straight. No. I've found it. Nice books. Have you read all the books? Did you think it's kept here for decoration? I may look stupid but I am not. No, I didn't mean that. I am terribly sorry. I want to tell you something… but, I don't know how to begin. Can't you help me? How can I help you without knowing the purpose? I'm going to say "sorry." But I never did so earlier. -Why? -For everything. For the happenings on the street and now in this house. Sorry. I won't be at peace if I don't apologize to someone. You said many times. You must do me a favor. -Tell me. -Not just one, but two. First, you've to step into my studio. Am I so holy? Where's your studio? It's here! Please come. This is my studio. I've stepped in. Favor number two. You must paint a portrait for me not on the computer but on canvas. Anything which recently attracted or afflicted you. Even a sketch will do. Please! I'm not a girl who doesn't respect artists. I'm a rich girl. But I don't have the pride of wealth. I'm unlike my father. I'm more like my mother. Comrade, I am sorry. I must go back home only after dropping you. It's raining and the condition of the roads are bad. I'll come now. -I'll wait downstairs. -Yeah. Goodnight. What about the wish? Goodnight. Nothing is wrong in this. We had sent a weakling to spoil the plan of mighty for the welfare of workers. What's wrong in this? I think that it is wrong. We're now discussing about how to manage the lockout problem. So, we'll think a way out. Instead of doing that, it isn't our duty to play tricks like a jackal. Let's live like a lion. What's wrong in dealing in wisely? I'm not a politician to do anything in the guise of wise. Hello. Wrong number! Hang up the phone. -It's wrong number, comrade. -That's what I'm saying as well. Bala is an honest girl. I'll not let you people use her as a means. -Oh! It seems you are her friend. -Why are you talking like this? What are you saying? There's no limit for love. It is love! No. I think it denotes something else. Poun, I will… We've to discuss deficit funds for the street play festival. Let's discuss about that. Idea! Shall we ask any soft drink company to sponsor us? Very nice! Then, why do you hold red flags? You could hold the white flags. You keep talking about expenses. Will the audience ask for a five-star hotel comforts? Why would they ask? If we enact well, they'll have a frugal meal and sleep on the verandah. Okay, the verandah is ready but we can't even afford a frugal meal. There may be about 200 people. We've to arrange basic amenities. -How much will it cost? -Will it cost 18,000 rupees? I asked whether it will cost 18,000 rupees? When did you come? -Beg your pardon! -No, I am sorry. When did you come? When you certified that Bala is an honest girl. Mr.Poun said it isn't affection but it denotes love. I walked in at-- Okay, forget it. That's our personal affair. Is 18,000 rupees enough for you? What for? For your street play festival. Oh. Look, you asked for a soft drinks sponsorer. Bala is here to sponsor. -No, Nalla is sponsoring it. -How? This is your money. You painted on my dining table the other day. -I sold it on the internet. -Greetings. Indian Food Company bought that for 20,000 rupees to print it in their promos. Really? I know you will question me. That's why, I've brought all this. -What's this? -Receipt. Oh! Sold for 20,000-- You said that you'll pay us 18,000 rupees. But there's a shortage of 2,000 rupees. Oh! This is a business deal. Don't I need a commission of ten percent? After all, she is a businessman's daughter. Am I lying? That's alright, comrade. We are short of 2,000 rupees but we're getting 18,000 rupees. We'll make our drama happening. This is just an advance amount. You can earn more than this. Isn't it a great thing to grab money from here itself for worker's welfare? Your father doesn't pay the workers and now I know why. Logically, I shouldn't have come here. Have you started to harp on the same string? -Good morning, ma'am. -Good morning, ma'am. Just agree to whatever my dad says. In that case I shouldn't have conducted the drama at all. I could've remained as his slave accepting his salary. Oh! Shouldn't we talk the truth here? Don't talk till we get the money. We're getting money for a good cause. I mean, for a good cause. Artists shouldn't be sold, but art can be sold, okay? The visitors should look at your portrait and be charmed by it. Who should get charmed? Comedy… Don't add such a comical streak to the portrait. I'll ensure it. Can you tell me your style preference? It's up to her to decide. What do I know about art? I know only about heart. My workers work here because I have a pure heart. Use your inspiration and paint it well. But remember one thing. The viewers shouldn't easily understand the subject of your painting. -Why? -It should be understood when explained. That's modern art, right? Sometimes I do crack jokes. Don't take it seriously. Have they arrived? It's been ten minutes. Oh Lord Siva! Why don't we paint Shiva? It will look beautiful. Do you mean Lord Shiva? Won't it look like a temple? We consider our profession as God. Then, the office is a temple, right? Let me know when I can start working. I don't want it to be done during office hours. Boss, tomorrow is Saturday, followed by Sunday. Then we have leave for five to six days for the festival. -You can start tomorrow. -Thanks. Don't switch on the AC during holidays. Five plants will be running without any use. You'll get a cool breeze if you open the doors. Even paint will get dried up quickly. -I think we should leave. -Sure. -Okay, Bye. Hail Lord Siva! -Greetings. Good. Come. Oh maiden! You spread the fragrance of flower When I draw a flower Oh love! Even my fingers feel The warmth of fire when I draw it If non-living things come to life What will happen to me? You're the portrait that's killing me Oh maiden! You spread the fragrance of flower When I draw a flower Oh love! Even my fingers feel The warmth of fire when I draw it When dots join, it will become a painting When hearts meet, it's an epic poem Lives are also a part of the portrait Even quarrel is also a part of love Azure is needed to paint the sky Which color is needed to paint our love? With my blood and With the brush like finger Let's paint our love, come Oh maiden! You spread the fragrance of flower When I draw a flower Oh love! Even my fingers feel The warmth of fire when I draw it Where do you find love in a girl's body? It's in the eyes of the person looking Where do you find love in a girl's body? It's in the part, never touched by a man You're an expert artist You're an expert in flattering girls Like the rain drops which touches The ground deceiving the clouds You fall on me, come Oh maiden! You spread the fragrance of flower When I draw a flower Oh love! Even my fingers feel The warmth of fire when I draw it If non-living things can come alive What will happen to me? You're the portrait that's killing me Very clever. He managed to incorporate communism in the corporate office. Okay, why did you choose to do that? If they insist on both Shiva and the ball bearing then, we've to add dolly. Look how beautiful 910 looks in the falls. -It's visible, right? -Of course! There is a sickle above the head and Karl Marx on the side. We can give 100 marks for the same. That painter painted as per my daughter's guidance. I never interfered in all this. She's very smart. -Be quiet, Dad. -She is feeling shy. -Then, that is-- -Sir. -Boss, he has committed fraud. -What do you mean? -Please come with me. -Wait a minute. Leave me. Look there. What's falling from the falls? Water. -It seems like 910. -Yes. It's the salary which we pay the workers. He's ridiculing us. Look there, can you see Karl Marx? Look at the top of Shiva's head. Sickle and the hammer. Okay, leave it. Look at Lord Shiva. -Can you recognize him? -It's him. I couldn't understand it myself. How did you get it? -When I looked at that painting intently-- -Hey! I overheard when he was talking to his friends. It was wrong to let in that arrogant man. Yes, our workers came to know about lockout from him. He was responsible for the strike notice. I thought that you would know everything. -I thought he's your future son-in-law-- -What? What do you mean? Don't you know this? Then, forget it. How can I leave it? What are you saying? Not me but the entire office is talking about them. They fell in love when the painting was going on. You had even asked to switch off the AC plant. It turned very hot. Boss, you can see it yourself. Did you see? We had asked him to paint on the wall but he has flattered your daughter. Boss, we shouldn't let this go. We've to nip it at the bud. Or else, we'll lose honor in front of workers. Sir, he is here. Ms. Bala is with him as well. -Goodnight. -Goodnight. -Hello. -I am Dharman speaking. Boss, Dharman is on line. -Ms. Bala has left. -Okay. Settle the matter silently. Please wait for a while. We'll be back. No need, we'll go to the office on our own. They even offered soft drinks. That's why, we're in a hurry. Are we not in a hurry? We can only enact play. Scoundrels, you've brought disgrace to the entire manhood. You people can't control your desires. -What's this, comrade? -Comrade! Thank God, we came by car -or else, we would've got delayed. -You're right. -Oh, God! -What're you searching? -Nalla has the keys. -Okay. -I will bring it. -Okay. -Couldn't you get the keys? -I thought I had them with me. Hey idiots, you could've done this in the Union office. No matter what but we end up peeing here as well. Isn't that right? Comrade, people are coming after you carrying sickles. It was him. Hey, who're you? -Get lost! -Go and have tea in the tea shop. I will kill you if you dare to utter a word! His corpse will be floating in the garbage. Come and pick it up. Go! -Listen! They want me. -Get lost! Go. -Comrade. -I'll take care. You go. Chop him. What's going on? Situation has gone worse. Get into the car. Driver, start the car. -Is it enough? -Do you want more? -Is it enough? -Do you want more? -Is it enough? -Do you want more? -Is it enough? -Do you want more? -Is it enough? -Do you want more? -Is it enough? -Do you want more? You unnecessarily picked up a fight with innocents. You're educated, right? You pierced them with an umbrella. You've fought with those college students. College students? They're professional rowdies. That's what they are telling about you all. They've filed a complaint against you all. You attacked them with music. Are you performing any musical program? -Sir, we-- -Be quiet. Look, I've to hear your statement also before filing the FIR. It's my fate. I'm patient. Don't irritate me. Tell me. Did you do it or not? not? We'll take care of the rest. There are eyewitnesses to prove it. If we don't accept it, you're not going to register it. The higher authorities would've given you clear instructions. -You carry on with your work. -Hey! That's how people from the union are. I'm doing my duty. Ask your union lawyer to get you out on bail. The court is on leave tomorrow and the next day. You're going to be locked up unnecessarily. That's fine but do lock us up in the same cell. Don't separate me just because I'm a woman. Ma'am, he's the accused. Others can leave. -How can we leave him behind? -Hey! Go home. -Shall I inform the Union office-- -No need. Sir, I can't afford to go out on a bail. I don't know have rich friends who can get me out on bail. So, you carry on with your duty. Think again. The court will be closed for two days. Isn't there anybody to get you out on bail? I'm here. Who are you? I am Bala. This is my lawyer. I've come with Mr. Nalla's bail application. -Bala, this is not needed. -Hey! -How's he related to you? -We're lovers. My father's name is Kandasamy Padayachi. -Our Kandasamy Padayachi! -Yes, sir. Ma'am, please be seated. Sir, please come with me. -Why? -Please come with me, sir. -Ma'am, you read this and then sign it. -Sir. What is wrong with you? Couldn't you tell me this earlier? You've found a rich girl. That's how you should settle in life. -How? -What do you mean? Take me for example. I'm like you. You would've heard about PK from Madurai. Don't you know PK? I reached this position with the help of his influence. Or else, I would've remained an unmarried constable all my life. I was afraid of thinking that you were a true communist. You're my man. Give me your hand. All the best! Enjoy! Constable, make it fast. Where're you coming from? Have you bailed out that street dancer? Yes. Logically, I should've bailed you out. But you had turned the tables. -What's this? -Where are you going? Please calm down. She was brought up independently. She's of the modern generation. -She-- -What nonsense! Am I dead? My generation is still in vogue. Only my rule should prevail here. I'm going to get her married within three months. I'll select a wealthy groom for her. She should marry him. Hello, I'm Poun speaking. It's me. A lot of problems have cropped up here. They've locked me up in the room. Why? What's the matter? I'll tell you later. I want to meet Nalla immediately. Come to the union office. Comrade will be there. Both of you can meet there. No! My dad will come to know if I come there. Come to our theater to watch a film. My father is the operator there. I'll ask comrade also to come there. Both of you can talk to each other. Okay! -Where are you going? -Bathroom. Come soon. -Dear, where are you going? -She'll come back now! What a snake! It's a python and not a cobra. Call me if there's any noise from the projector. Don't touch it. It will burn! Comrade, would you like to have something? Coffee or tea? Okay. Only few minutes are left. What? -What's this? That day you-- -Oh! Are you returning the bail amount? Are you trying to settle the accounts? That's not my money… but your own money. You painted at my father's office, right? This is the payment for the same. I don't want any payment for that. I did that… -out of affection! You-- -Oh! Why are you formally talking to me? Has love turned into affection? Damn! What? What is happening? What is this? Please allow me to talk. I know what you're going to say. No, what I'm-- I'm rich and you're poor. You have got a doubt if you can keep me happy all my life. Right? -I'm damn sure about it! -It's a lie! It's a lie! Yes! Shall I tell you the actual reason? It's because you are selfish. Bala, I don't know how to make you understand-- No need. I understand. Love is fun! But marriage becomes a problem. You'll lose your freedom, right? We'll lose our freedom! Your father's influence… -I can't fight him all our life. -So? So… -marry a rich boy of your father's-- -No! No. I… I'll marry someone else. I'll marry someone else. It's enough if you attend my marriage sitting in the front row and bless me! But that will only be obsequious. A corpse will get married… and beget children. Can I name my child after you? -What's this Bala? -Go to hell! Sorry. -I am going to hell. -Wait. Thanks. Comrade, what's the noise here? What happened? Why is she crying? What did you do to make her cry? No, I'm not crying! Your leader is struggling for a girl's life. He'll write a story for you. You can enact that on the streets. Can you explain it to us in a better manner? Didn't you get her? -It will burn your hand. -He doesn't want to fall in love with a rich girl under these circumstances. -That's right. -What do you mean? Was she poor when he loved her? Didn't he know that? What can comrade do for that? He needn't do anything. Let us all decide. -What decision! -A good decision! -What is that for? -For this love story! Don't say that they're in love. Both of them-- Why do you fight when you both love each other so deeply? Can't you go somewhere and get married? Yes. That's it! -Venkatesh, when did you come? -I come at the right moment. Why should we get scared of Padayachi? We all must plan something and get them married. -Correct, what am I trying to say is-- -Wait, I will say it. We'll take them to Kerala and get them married there. -We have people there to support us. -Correct. We'll send them to Karnataka on a honeymoon. Can we be a part of the wedding? We just need two witnesses! Good idea! But suggest if there's any other better idea. I'll tell my idea later. It's wrong for many of us to be in the cabin. Please go. What a fall! You talk about painting, street drama and ideology and used to behave brave. Now why are you running away from a girl? Don't you feel ashamed? Hey! Even Karl Marx fell in love. What's there to feel ashamed of? What happened to you? Don't you really know anything or are you just pretending? Take your hands off. I asked you. You're pretending, right? I didn't get you. Do you want me to say it? Why are you people behaving like this? Who? Who? You will understand only if told with aristocratic attitude. -I don't know all this. -What? I don't know how to fondle you with my attire and looks. -Are you talking about Bala? -Obviously! -Shall I keep a mirror? -No, the hotel-- What did you see in her? You… She's very pretty, right? I got to know the reason. Why are you talking like that? You are… You are pretty. Pretty? I'm like a man! Why? -If you wear a pant and shirt-- -Why? Why did I wear pants and a shirt? I did it for you! I wore this attire and rode a bike for you. I never liked coffee and tea. I started having it just because you liked it. All my efforts have gone to the dogs. Hey, wait. You're going leaving, right? Why do you want me to wait? You mean you… Wow! Columbus, you've found it! You didn't… even tell me about this! Do I have to tell you this? I was yapping after you for four years. Everybody knows it. Only you didn't notice it! According to me we both are comrades. That's why you were boring me with all this. -Don't talk like that. I really like-- -Listen! Don't repeat that line. Understand one thing. Both, like and love are different. Yeah! Like and love, both are different. -Yeah! -Yeah. I was ignorant. But committing suicide… Hey! Why do you talk like an idiot? I was about to say that I won't commit suicide. I'm a courageous girl! -I am so-- -Get lost! Sorry. -It's alright. -Sorry. Hey. I betrayed you! Whom did you betray? Venkatesh. Do you mean the one who's in our troupe? What's it? He is begging me for the past three years to marry him. -Oh! -But it was me… You… Don't think that I won't be happy! I'll marry before you marry her. Oh, no! What am I talking? -Sorry. Come. -No, I'll do it by myself. Shouldn't I even do this? Hereafter, Bala is everything for you. -Bye. -Hey. -Where are you going? -I need someone's support. I'll go to Venkatesh! -Listen to one more thing. -What's it? Venkatesh shouldn't come to know what I told you. Yeah. It will hurt him all his life. Get lost! When did you come? So sad! What happened to you? Headache? Stomach ache? Should we get only headaches and stomach ache? Can't I fall in love, comrade? Love? With who? My love is walking down the stairs. Are you joking? Is this a joke? Is this a joke? I am sorry. -You and she are… -We have a difference of four years! Apart from that you're shorter than her. Love is blind, comrade. Right. Poet Kannadasan said that our anatomies should also match to fall in love. Hey, I am sorry. Hey, Poun. Where are you going? If I cry on their marriage, her life will get spoiled. I'll come and cry in your marriage. At least, you'll understand me. What? Can I come or not? I don't know whether to cry or laugh. Why do you get confused? You can laugh and I'll cry. If we keep on talking like this, we'll miss the bus. Oh, God! What are you saying? Chennaippa called from Madras. It seems your daughter didn't reach there by the morning flight. You gave her a send-off at the Coimbatore airport. Yes, I went up to the security check. I didn't go after that. Where did she vanish? I came to know that the guy and your daughter… are planning to get married secretly in Kerala. Where is he now? I got the information that he went by the morning bus to Kerala. Even your daughter might be with him. Give me change, please. Hey, stop! Stop! Don't run in the middle of the road. Oh, my God! Oh, God! Oh, no! Get up. -Don't worry. It's nothing. -Mom. Go quickly. Poun. Go quickly. Poun. Poun. -Poun. -I'm here. Give me your hand. -Comrade! -Wait. Comrade! Hold this. I'm not able to reach it, comrade. Still not able to reach it. I'm short in height. Pull me out, comrade. Thank God. This dog was responsible for the bus accident. Beat it! Kill it! Search all over the place. Look there. That dog caused the bus to overturn. Beat it. Buddy, it has run away. A body is lying there. He's still alive. Lift him. -It's impossible to save him. -Can we leave him here? -Come to this side. -Hold properly. Check if my daughter is there. Sir. Thank God, she's not my daughter. Move quickly. Put him into the ambulance quickly. Move. May I know the survivors' list? A man named Nalla. And a girl. What's the girl's name? Girl's name is Parvathi. -Thank God, she's not your daughter. -Hey! She decided to elope and marry. So, won't she change her name? Take out the vehicle. Boss, this girl is not your daughter. Hail Lord Shiva for his mercy. But, he's here, boss. Excuse me. He is serious. This is not a visiting hour. He's a close relative. Nalla, do you know these gentlemen? -Will he survive? -There's a chance of 20%. Don't tell the patient. We are going in for surgery. Talk to him positively and affectionately. You can't talk for too long. Only ten minutes. Please give him some hope. My boss owns a hospital in Coimbatore. Only ten minutes. Boss. Don't worry. I'll not kill you with a pillow. That's not the kind of person I am. Thousands of families are living on my mercy. You tried to spoil my family's reputation. Hail Lord Shiva for his mercy. Did you see? Do you know how many years have I been praying for? Never missed a day. Even when I'm visiting foreign countries, I take an idol along with me. Is it a cinema story? Do you think it is easy to marry a rich girl and live in a hut? This is the truth. Hey. Do you know the truth? I pray every day for two hours. That's the truth. I could've reduced you to ashes. But I didn't do it. Do you know why? I know Lord Shiva will punish you for your sins. Boon! It's a boon to me. You're a poor communist party worker. Do you want a millionaire's daughter? Boss, pull out the oxygen tube. Let him die. I'll not do such things. He'll take care of it. All the arrangements are being made for that. Did they tell you that you've only ten percent chance to survive? -Boss, 20%! -Hey. Why does he need that additional ten percent? Let him give up that. Hey, give up that ten percent as well. Can I get my person married to a person like you? Tell me. It's impossible, right? This is not my wish but God's order. You better die. Did you hear me? You better die. What is all this? I told you only ten minutes. Sister, he's wishing him an early recovery. No! Out! Oh, my God! Doctor! You gentlemen leave right now! Who's God? Everyone's God! Life is a penance Love is God For theists, God is love For atheists, love is God Let's all say it together Love is God Let's all say it together Love is God Let's all say it together Love is God Let's all say it together Love is God Who's God? Everyone's God! Life is a penance Love is God Come on, Nalla. That's it. Come on. Can you read it? Now? A-D-- Don't forget to take your medicines and your exercises. Nalla, I forgot something. I bless you, my son. Bye. Bye. Everyone's God Life is a penance Love is God Please be seated. Why have you come here? I am here to meet Bala. She has settled in a foreign country. She's married. When? Four months ago. What? I've got the good news that she's pregnant. Don't spoil her life now by expressing your love. We can tell 1000 lies to conduct a marriage. I could've told my daughter 5000 lies. But I got her married with just one lie. I told her that you're dead. She believed me. She cried for some days. Then she agreed to this marriage because of me. Imagine yourself in my position as a father and think. You'll understand everything. I've told just one lie. Don't make me a killer. Hey! Don't think that I'm threatening you. I can give you as much money as you ask. I've never desired anyone's downfall. Everyone should live happily. Don't think I'm going away because of your threats or your money power? You said something about love. I'm going away only for that love. I am going. Take it as a boon from me, which your God denied you. I'll remain a dead man for your daughter. Hey, bloody fool! Drive carefully. Live like a king. -Jaya, come here. -Coming. Pour this. Why are you watching there? When we took you out from there we never imagined that you'll survive and come back to us. It's all because of the doctors. Doctors? You survived because of the good deeds of your parents. It's my parent's good deeds that saved my shop from the bus. Sir, people who survive near death are said to be equal to God. Now, you're God. -You are God as well. -Really? Anyone who shows human compassion is God according to me. It's good to hear. Come here, lazy bones. How many times have I told you to keep this inside? Do you want it to be crushed by a bus? You never let down an opportunity to eat. I'll make a special chicken delicacy for you. You must definitely eat. -Won't you invite me? -Get lost. He has come alive from near death. So, I'm preparing a special dish for him. You're fit for nothing. Why do you need all this? I remembered something. Sacrifice that Satan for him. Everything will be fine. What harm did it do to you? It overturned a bus. I am talking about that. Who's that Satan? He's telling about that dog sleeping there. It doesn't respond to anyone's call. It will come only for food. Look how clever it is. Sister, look there. The dog has come to him and is asking for forgiveness. Hey, do you know dog's language? -What's the dog's name? -It is known as Satan. It was named by the people. We can't change it now. Whose dog is it? No one in particular. It's common property. It will eat when it wants and rest. I am just like him. Can I take it with me? Hey, look at Satan's luck. Don't worry. -You'll recover and be fine very soon. -Okay. She too got hurt when she was young. But now she's fine. Okay. Hey! You got in already. -Bye! -Bye! I'll take leave now. Do visit us whenever you wish to. -Definitely. -Don't forget us. -Damn! -Coromandel may arrive. Get ready. Oh, damn! Have some biscuits. -Thank you. -Mineral water. Shit! Didn't he say that the train is arriving? It seems they'll not accept a credit card. -But you've bought tickets. -It's second class. It seems there's no first class in the entire train. -Okay, come. -Go. Isn't it enough to reach your destination via a train? To heck with it, sir. This country never offers comforts even if you're ready to pay for them. That's India for you. Until people like you who think of getting everything for money exist, then that will be India for you. You might end up saying that Soviet Union is best in the world. -No, we can't say that. -Accept it! Whether you accept it or not but Soviet Union is no more a United Nation. It has broken up into small countries. Now, no Soviet Union means no communism, right? Then, why are you talking about it? Mr. Romeo! For instance, if Taj Mahal crumbles down… will you all stop loving it? Okay, very clever. But mister, love is a feeling. Communism too is a feeling. Many had felt that way earlier as well. -But Karl Marx wrote about it and-- -Oh, rubbish! -I must not be talking about it to you. -Rubbish! Especially you shouldn't talk. Why? -Because the train has arrived. -Oh! The train has arrived. -Why shouldn't I talk about it? -Can you bear the truth? Of course! Go ahead! Hit me! Because you are a selfish guy. Excuse me! You're a hawker selling products of -multinational companies on the TV. -Mr. Sivam! That is my business, okay? What if you sell everything in the name of business? He's already claiming rights over turmeric and rice. If you keep asking people for money people won't understand if you have a stand. Don't get personal. In spite of having an ugly face and being physically challenged you're very proud. -Isn't this personal? -That's… Yeah! You started it. Okay, I did. Shouldn't I finish it? -Will you hear me out? -Go ahead. Pharaohs had built pyramids, right? You are all like those slaves. Multinational companies throw the bones-- Are you calling us dogs who pick those bones? How dare you! What's this? You hit me while I was talking. I was about to say you're slaves waiting for the bones thrown by the MNC's. It's the same thing, Mr. Sivam. What's that red thing flowing out of your nose? Blood? -One minute. I will get some-- -No problem, leave it. I like the color. Red is the color I like most You're a madman. You are bonkers. -You're mad! -You as mad as well. Provocation is something I don't like! Will you prick on one's weak spot continuously? Your nose is bleeding. I am sorry. Okay? Okay. Board the train. -Don't feel guilty. -I am not guilty! -I'm angry. -On me? No, I'm angry on myself. I'm angry for getting angry. Sorry. Don't get angry often. It's a disease. Your eyes have turned red. I'll take care of them. Leave it. There's a way to stay cool. Do you know that? You must not insult me again. No, it's a good one. Will you follow it? -What? -Do you believe in God? -Oh, no! -If you do, think of God in your mind. -Then? -Close your eyes, and count from five to one. What if I do that? -Train will go away. Try it once. -Okay. Oh, God! Damn! Sivam! Sivam! Where are you? You piece of shit! Come out! Open the door. This is red, the color you like most. Is it enough? Isn't this anger? Did you see how I showed my anger in a mature manner? You punched my nose and so did I. We both had bleeding noses. That's all. Okay, open the door. Okay. -Where's the mineral water bottle? -Won't you wash with this water? I want it to drink. I bought a bottle for you. Did you leave it there itself? Go and get it. Otherwise train will move. Please. I am in pain. Shall I get it? Only if you don't mind. -Come on, hurry up. -Coming. -Open the door. -Hurry up. Open the door. -I'm doing that only. -I'm handicapped. Oh! Door is jammed. -Open it quickly. -Oh! Okay! Try to open it without getting tensed and angry. Oh! Shouldn't I get angry? What should I do to control my anger? Shall I think of my favorite God close my eyes and count backwards from five to one? But the train is moving forward. Sorry, Mr. Sivam. -Sorry. -It's alright. Are you going to Chennai? Listen! Sorry, I don't lend my books. -No problem. -I don't lend my books to others. A book and a girl can both land in the same situation. -Oh! -Didn't get it? I'll explain it in Tamil. If you lend your book and your girlfriend to someone else then they will both get ruined. I told that in God's own language. You've forgotten God as well as the Sanskrit language. Do you know Sanskrit? I don't know. I shouldn't lie to you. I know many things. Take it as if I don't like advertisements. Advertisement reminds me of many things. Do you know Ogilvy? -Father of the world-- -He is a… He is a great man. I mean… he had proved that man is what he's wearing. -I like this man. He is my guru. -So… -are you an ad filmmaker? -Of course! I'm also an ad filmmaker. Of course, I don't know much about that. Mahatma Gandhi is also my guru. If you ask me, I will tell you the connotation. By wearing such clothes he had proved that dress isn't important, but the man is. Yes. What happened? Am I talking too much today? No! I like it, Mr. Uthaman. It's such a… -such a great pleasure to meet you. -Why? I got stuck with a man from Bhubaneswar to Ichchapuram. -Oh, God! -Really? I almost cracked while trying to take him off my back. You are what your company is. Yeah. Would you like… -Would you like some biscuits? -No! -I am sorry. I can't take this. -Why? I've heard about gangs who are looting people with these biscuits. -I don't want to take any risk. -What? I'm not blaming you. Did you buy them yourself? -So, you didn't buy them yourself. -No. Sir! -What's this? -I have saved your life. You want a diversion, right? Whiskey! It's not risky. Hold this. Have a shot, man! Excuse me. Sir! -Yes? -Sir. Yeah. Sir… -My bag? -What? My bag, my suitcase and my laptop are missing. Oh, God! I don't know Telugu. No problem. You can speak in Tamil. -Your luggage is missing, right? -Yes, sir. He has taken away the luggage of two others as well. Oh, God! Who did it, sir? The man who was sitting here and talking to you last night. -Who? Mr. Uthaman? -Yes. How can you be so sure? He's the one missing. So, he might be the thief. No, sir. That's not possible. He is a very decent man. He was very fluent in English and Sanskrit. He was wearing suit and tie. He would've stolen it from people like you. No, I don't believe this, sir. Is it necessary for a man wearing suit to be a gentleman? Will a man wearing home spun cotton be a freedom fighter? -Why did the train halt? -Yes. When will we reach Madras? It will take two days. What? The train which left before this has met with an accident near Bapatla. Many people are fighting for their lives. The train will halt here for two days until the route is clear. I came to tell you the same. If you are in an urgency, you can take a bus. Hear me out! We need AB -ve blood to save a life. Your attention please! We need AB -ve blood to save a life. We need AB -ve blood to save a life. If there's anyone with AB -ve blood group, -reach medical camp immediately. -Hey! -AB -ve! -Sivam. Mr friend, Mr. Aras is a AB -ve donor. Thank God! Go to the medical camp and donate blood. Are you AB -ve? No! But I am O +ve and I already donated blood. Good! He is the first AB -ve donor! Come! You're the first AB -ve donor. I have a sick feeling about blood. I feel like I'll throw up. -Only if you drink. -Oh, I hate blood. If you hate blood, why don't you donate it? -No. Please listen to me. -Come with me. Why are you ordering me? Is it Russia to get ordered? -Why do always drag Russia for everything? -Why don't you leave me alone? -I don't like it. -Why? I'll help in some other way. -Why? -They will inject my hand. It's just a prick! -What prick? -It's a thin prick. Thief! He is running away. Don't leave him. Catch him! -Hey! -Yeah. He is a thief. Leave it. He's not a thief. He's Uthaman. -Oh, sorry! Is he your friend? -He is a thief! Hey! Bloody rogue! Where's he? Mr. Pantulu. Pantulu! -Hi. -Hi. -How are you? -Get up. -What is it? -No! -They're local people. -What were you up to? Hold him. -Why are you beating him? -Sorry. You don't know about me! I am not a saint. I am a killer! I am a natural killer! Why are you laughing at me? Did you see that? Are you an educated man? You're behaving so violently! Bloody thief! Are you an educated man? I'm an illiterate. Leave it aside. You're calling me a thief. I searched your entire baggage and didn't find a penny in it. How can a thief survive like this? Don't embarrass me without knowing my predicament. I had money. You know it, right? Tell him that I lost all my money. -What are you laughing at? Shut up! -You can laugh, sir. How can he stop you? That is his problem! Is it my problem? -If I hit you-- -Wait. -Where's my bag? -Don't shout! Mr.Pantulu… give his bag to him and collect ten rupees from him. -My bag! -Give him ten rupees! I don't know if you have it. All of you pay him ten rupees each and take your bags. Hey! Who's that? Who's that? Take the glasses. -Take it. -Glass. Oh! You! Are you a Tamilian? So, you betrayed me. Why don't you take me to a police station? Take me to the police station. Take me to the police station. -Sir, why are you getting angry? -What do you want? You've a long life. I am sorry, Mr. Sivam. I left you behind in the station. No one has ever hit me on my nose like that. -Sorry. -I am the only child. -Okay. -I am the only son to my parents. How's that? -My elder brother died young. -Oh. He was playing cricket and the ball hit his eye and we had to go to the hospital. Ever since then, on seeing blood… -Oh shit! -Okay. -Are you alright? -No, I am not! Since then I've great aversion for hospitals and ambulances. That's alright. How did you reach this place? If I say something, you might feel dizzy. I came in an ambulance carrying blood. I've many friends who are doctors and nurses. You've friends all over the world. I'm confused as to whom I should believe. The man I met… Nowadays man has become a cannibal. I'm also hungry. I threw away the biscuits only because of that cheat. But let me tell you something, Mr.Sivam. Appearances are deceptive. This is what I had told you at airport. There's no need for a terrorist to appear ugly. -He can look handsome-- -Like me. Likewise, there is no need for a good man to look handsome. He might look-- Have an ugly face like you. -How can you laugh about everything? -I can't control it. But I don't feel like that. -You'll also be able to. -Oh, God! I feel nervous and scared for everything. I had a feeling that I know everything. But, I am ignorant. I am useless, sir. Why do you say that? Don't be like that. Be positive. You're an AB -ve. But be positive. -Now, you lost-- -Nalla. Hi, Nalla. What a surprise! Nice to see you. Come! My goodness! God bless you! You are okay? You are looking handsome. -He is handsome. -Come. She's Sister Venessa. -She saved my life and made my-- -Shut up! This is Aras, my friend. AB -ve. AB -ve? Thank God! We need your blood to save a life. I… -Is he Tamil? -Yes. A boy's life must be saved. I understand English. -But I have a problem. -You have jaundice? -Not that! No! -Tetanus? -Nervous? -Yes! Such a big man like you to be nervous. Come on! No, you can't compel me. I don't want to go. -What? -For your betterment only. -I am not compelling you to come with me. -Yeah. But I want you to see what you can do. -No, I don't want to go. -She says you'll change your mind. -Listen to me. Hello! -Come. Sir! Stop! Sister, this is emotional blackmailing. Listen to-- This boy is going to die in the next 20 minutes. If we get blood, we can save his life. It's up to you now. Take my blood. Wait. Are they going to crucify you? Come. -Come. -What should I do now? Sleep on this bed. Sleep. -Shoes? -You can wear shoes. Mr. Sivam. A human body has about five liters of blood. They will take a small quantity of blood, right? Don't worry, my son. We'll not kill one man to save another man. Promise. I trust you. No problem at all. What's that? It's too sharp. They've to prick you. I have to go to a function in Chennai urgently to meet my fiance. Don't worry. You will function very well. What? Can't they go without the siren? An ambulance will always have a siren. We'll get a clear road only if the siren is switched on. It has been going on for ages. We can't change it now. What happened? My dear child. What's your name? Uncle is asking you. I didn't ask. Tell him. Poun. Pounraj. His name is Poun as well. Poun. I had an old friend. I mean I have a friend. Watch. -Watch. -Watch! I got it. Watch? Did you lose it in the accident? -Some thief might have stolen it. -Shall I give my watch? You've come back alive. That's great news. Forget about the watch. We'll buy a new one in Chennai. I want to talk. Excuse me. What else do you want? Rubber ball. It seems he wants a rubber ball. Oh, God! Driver, be careful! Sister, he had been driving all day and night. Driver, stop at some good place. We'll have tea and proceed. Sir, where's Mr. A. Aras? He has gone to the shop to buy a ball. Order two strong teas for us. I'll go-- -Oh, God. -Wait. -That's an important paper. -Your bag is torn. -Keep it here. Thanks. -Okay. Okay. -I'm on the outskirt and I'll come. -Sir. Yeah, okay. Bye. A small request. I was about to spoil all my efforts. I threw off the cheque in the slush. My bag is torn. It's damaged like me. Keep it safely in your bag. I'll take it once we reach Chennai. Okay, no problem. Give that ball as well. -Take it. -Thank you. Where's the money for it? I don't have any money. Now you're in my territory. Would you like to call your family? -No. -Don't worry. I owe you one call. Only a newly married man needs to call his wife to bolster her confidence. I'm married for a long time. You have children? -Yeah. -Yeah? How many? One son. What's his name? Sangu. Sankaran. Sangu? Why don't you buy something for him? -That's not needed. -No, I want to buy him something. -What about chocolates? -Buy him a ball. -Another ball please. Are you sure? -Yeah. He likes to play with a ball. Put this ball into the bag. This is for you. That's for you. Doctor! Doctor! Palpitations. -What happened? -Please go away. -Please be careful. -Nalla. He's pressing-- He is-- Be careful. Will you have tea? Would you like to have tea? I need some tea. Damn! What's all this? I'm not able to understand. What's all this? A train got derailed. A boy got wounded. We got him to the brink of death. We somehow managed to get a rare blood group. We tried to save his life. What's all this tyranny to kill him on the way? Dammit! What sort of God are you? In fact in such situations, belief in the existence of God gets-- No. I am sorry. Unlike you, I believe in God. Who said that I don't believe in God? Oh! Have you suddenly become a believer of God? I have always believed in God. Who's that God? Look, I don't understand your jokes. Because it is not a joke. The heart that sheds tears for a stranger… is considered a God. Thank you. Why are you so merciful on me? Because I'm also a God. I know it. There must be some hook to it. Okay. Who said you're a God? A woman who owns a shop at the mountain. I started believing it from that day. You didn't get it, right? You must not understand. That's God. A. Aras. You are a good man. -So are you. -I know. You are the last world freak! Who's God? You and me are Gods Life is a penance Love is God If heart is just a piece of flesh Fire will consume it If it's a tool of love It will win over death Let's say it together Love is God Let's say it together Love is God Let's say it together Love is God -Excuse me. -Yes. Is it house number 16? -Correct. -Is Mr.Sivam there? No, I don't think so. He wears thick glasses and has a disfigured face. -Oh! It's our Nalla! -Who? -Nalla's full name is Nallasivam. -Yes. What do you want? Mr. Sivam's cheque is with me-- -Are you Mr. Aras? -Yes. Oh! He has gone out to call you. Thank God! You've come with the cheque. Your cheque is here. Don't worry anymore. -Has our cheque come? -Yes, it is for everyone. -Have you all given your names? -Yes. All affected people will get money. He's responsible for getting this money. Thank you, sir. Thank you very much, sir. I'm not able to get up. -Please forgive me, sir. -No problem. Greetings, sir. I can never forget the favor that you have done for us. I sincerely bless you and your family to lead a happy life. I'll take leave. -You've given us a new life. -Oh, no! Get up. My daughter's marriage is due to your benevolence. I didn't do anything. Mr. Sivam did everything. -May you always be blessed. -Okay. Get it signed and deposit it in the bank. -Do it immediately. -Sir, excuse me. Mr.Sivam told me that he resides at house number 16. He stays here whenever he visits this place. -What do you mean? -Sir. -Then, what about his wife and son? -Okay. What? Wife and son? He doesn't have anyone. No. He said he had a son. He has a son. He said his name is Sankaran. Sangu. -Did he say Sangu is his son? -Yes. Actually he's right. He's here. He's Sangu. Thank you. Sangu, did you get bored? How did you come-- I was trying to reach you. That cheque was in your bag. I gave the cheque. Did you go to the union office? Yes, I went there thinking it was your residence. Is he your son? Wife? That's not a total lie. Maybe I had someone like her in my heart. Leave it. Is she dead? She is not yet born. Nice. The truth is… I don't have any relatives. Everyone feels insecure. I am insecure that I don't have a wife. Am I not wearing this shoe to try and manage the length of my leg? My wife is… an imaginary walking stick. I shouldn't get dejected in life. Okay, get into the car. Why? Because I'm getting married today. I know that. I'll come later in the evening. No! Now! Why are you threatening me? Why should I come now? Because, I'm a God! I'm ordering you. Get into the car. I'm also a God. I'm also saying I'll come later. Hey, Sangu. -Get down. -No, stay! A dog can understand the feeling that you can't! The opposite spelling of Dog is God. Why do you always torture me by your arguments? I too don't have anyone. No sisters or brothers. I had a brother. I lost him when-- He died getting hit by a cricket ball. I had-- I already told you all this! Yeah. Sorry. I've got back my brother again. Yeah! Okay? Yeah. You must always be with me. All my life. Why didn't you tell me all this earlier? It's because I was a little shy. I have finally said it. Is it love to go on repeating? -You should understand! -Yeah. Are you getting into the car-- You are a mad man. What's this? What's with the adventure? You got us all anxious. I've come back. It's all over. -I am alive because of him. -Thank you. If he hadn't been there, everything would've been delayed. And then we wouldn't be able to find a marriage hall. Thanks, brother. He is my elder brother. He is not your brother but mine. -Elder brother? I didn't get you. -Didn't you get it? -It is-- -I'm a God. Do you understand? -No, I didn't get this. -You won't get this. You are all Gods. I'll explain to you later. Can I have some coffee, please? Uncle, what are those marks on your face? You must not ask that. -No problem. -She can ask. He has an answer for every question. I went to a barber's shop for a shave in Gujarat. An earthquake hit at that time. -What happened after that, Uncle? -Hi, Saras. -How are you? -I have a good face cut. I've come back. My phone is not working. I'm calling from my uncle's cell phone. Yes. Okay. When shall we meet? Oh, my God! Okay. -She is very angry. -That's obvious! -Would you do me a small favor? -What is it? Give this letter-- -Love letter? -Yes. -I wrote it in Bhubaneswar. -Come. Give this to her and -narrate a dramatic story. -Okay. -You're changing your dress also. -This is good. This God didn't like it. Satisfied? Not only that, you're groom's friend. So hurry up! Bride's people are staying that side. -Hurry up. -Okay. You carry on. Bloody rogue! Why have you come here? -Don't allow anyone in. -Okay, boss. -Is this your daughter's second marriage? -Hey, don't talk. Before anyone sees you, go away! It's wrong to misbehave like this with groom's family. Do you know the consequences if Anbarasu comes to know about this? How do you know the groom? You are being disrespectful with me, How do you know the groom, sir? He's like my younger brother. Brother? Okay, forget it. What do you expect from me? -It's getting late. Where's the boss? -He's discussing something. He has ordered not to allow anyone inside. Go. Move away. -I fall at your feet. -Oh, no! -Why are you falling at his feet? -Close the door. Is it enough? I never asked for this. Okay. I'm ready to do anything. I want to meet Bala. No way. You can't meet Bala. Why not? I can walk up to her. Am I a living dead man? Don't interfere. -Tell me. -You do one thing. Sit in a corner and meditate. Let me see if your Lord Shiva will dare to stop me. I feel it's my chance now to grant you a boon. You love Bala, right? Forgive me for her sake and grant me a boon. How can I grant a boon? You lied to me that Bala is married and pregnant. You lied to Bala that I'm dead. -You had cheated your daughter Bala. -God promise-- Why do you unnecessarily drag God into it? Did you ever wait in a queue to pray to God? You'll always jump queues. You'll commit all sins and donate liberally. God will forgive all your sins and save you, right? God can't save people like you. He's just a coolie. He also charges money to do a job. -I've understood. -What? Cash. You want that, right? You quote it. I'll settle it here itself. I don't want it in one go. -Send it to me every month. -Why? Did you forget? 910! That's workers' problem. What's your need? What do you expect from me? Let their problems get solved. That's what I want. Sign the agreement enhancing their salaries. I'll go away. It's time for marriage. Is it possible to arrange for a meeting now. It will work out. You can call them. They will come. We are here for that purpose. -Hi. -Hi. -You look very beautiful. -Thank you. How's this t-shirt? Mr. Sivam wears full sleeves shirts. Mr. Sivam? Yes. He is my new elder brother. -Elder brother? -I'll tell you about it later. Just have to look for-- Hey! How's this? Hereafter you're a big hero among workers. May you live long. Why don't you enter politics? You'll be very successful. I don't have such an ambition. I'm just a tool. That's all. After hitting a nail, a hammer should be put to rest. After cutting the crops, a sickle also needs to be put to rest. I'll watch you sign the papers from a corner and walk out silently. Let it appear as if you come down yourself. -Give this letter to Anbarasu. -Why? Don't get scared. You can read it and then give it to him. Boss, the union leaders have arrived. Read it and then hand it over to him. -Greetings, sir. -Greetings. Greetings. -Is it ready? -It's in my hand. -Tell him. -Where's he? -It's in the bag. -Take it out and keep it ready. Hey! Don't run on to the streets. Be careful. Thank you very much, sir. All workers will hail you wholeheartedly. No need of all those big words. Hail mercy of Lord Shiva. Shiva orders me and I just follow it. -We'll take leave. -Okay. We'll take leave. We can paste this agreement on the board. And give it to newspapers, right? One minute. How can you leave without partaking in the marriage feast? -Is everything ready? -Everything's ready. -Have food and go. -Okay. -We can send in a press note today itself. -You did a good job. Boss! -What's this, boss? -Hey! Go and get my rifle. He made me kneel before the workers. -I must not leave him alive. -No, don't harm him. Your daughter is getting married. Don't do anything. Why am I here? I'll do it. Okay, don't do anything here. -Make it a clean effort. -Okay. Hey! His death should look ugly. Whose letter is this? Didn't I tell you about my brother, Sivam? What language is this? I'm not able to understand a word of it. It's Tamil. Look at the way he has scribbled. His right hand is paralyzed. He wrote with his left hand. Are you able to understand it? Please read it for me. -My dear comrade, Anbarasu. -Sangu. Though our principles are totally different but you still considered me as your brother and gave a permanent place to stay. Give it to me. Birds and mendicants don't have a permanent sanctuary. I'm a also a bird. A bird that finds such sanctuaries uncomfortable. And hence the affection you've for me shouldn't go waste. Share it fully with your wife. I doubt I'll ever come again under the shadow of my brother's love in my life. But there're many surprises stored in this world. Meeting you was also one such surprise. I'm embarking on a journey and awaiting surprises in my life. There're many pleasant surprises in store for your future wife. You'll be the reason for all that. You must be. Your loving brother, Sivam. Hey, Sangu! Where are you going? Come here. Did you enter the dustbin? You idiot. Sorry. You dog. Listen to me. Spit it out. I'll buy you good food. Listen to me. I will get you good food. Is it a cat? Hey! Don't harm the dog. Sangu, go away. Had I been like before, I would've fought with you. Now I can't even run. I read your letter. I committed many sins at the behest of Kandaswamy. And God has punished me for the same. Do you remember we had come to meet you in the hospital? After that within six months… my daughter fell sick and died in a hospital. She was my only daughter. She should've been married by now. You saw my boss, right? But God never punished my boss. He is a horrible person. God has punished me for the sins I committed at my boss's behest. If I harm good people like you… God will punish me with a gory death. I believe in God. I don't know about you. I believe in God as well. Really? Which God do you believe in? Me? A man who comes to kill another man… but changes his heart and asks for forgiveness, according to me, he is a god. I've changed my heart. I'm not a god. Don't talk like an atheist. There are many gods here. We are not able to identify them. Believe me. Thanks. -I'll take your leave. -Don't come back. Don't come and spoil my life. I'll tell my boss that I've killed you. What do you mean? I'll not spoil your life. Live happily. Let's all say it together Love is God Let's all say it together Love is God Let's all say it together Love is God I can't believe he did this to me. But he is right! Sivam is like a bird. It was my mistake to think of caging him. Son-in-law, you can talk at leisure. We're running late. Please come. Boss! I have killed him. Hail Lord Siva's mercy. Son-in-law, please come. We're running late. You and me are God A man drinking the nectar of love Lives eternally Life's span is as long As your heart's magnanimity Let's all say it together Love is God Let's all say it together Love is God
