Laundry machine? You know what ours is like. It's pretty old. Not just old, it's practically a relic. It should be in a museum, no, it should be sent to CSI, and ask how it's still running. I get it, but please stop buying crap, okay? - You know the chances. - Slim to none. And... I wasn't gonna say this but... You used up all your luck on something else, you got nothing left for these contests. Me? What? Where did I use up all my luck? To meet me! What a cutie!

We can't even afford a new laundry machine, how could we justify going on a trip after taxes? - Sure we can! - Fat chance! Why not? It's the real Hawaii, not the fake one we went to! - Honeybun, let's go. - Enough! Being pretty can't cover closing shop for a week! Happiness is momentary, are we gonna starve afterwards? What's wrong with that? We can work hard afterwards, being frugal is nice, but is this what being frugal is? Look, these are my sweatpants, and you're not even in the Youngcheon BIA! I'll sell it on eBay. Holy cow! We can buy a laundry machine. Don't mention this to Nari. - You're a communist. - What? I didn't say anything. Nari, you're home? I'm home... Why is life so hard? That's what I'm saying. Nari's Class Moms Mrs. LEE, look what Nari did. Nari, not again! What did you do now?! Don't shout at her! Nari, fess up, what happened? You're acting again! He saw me in my tutu, and said I look like a sumo wrestler! So let me learn taekwondo! - Sumo wrestler! - I hate ballet! I hate it! You're already vicious, you'll end up killing kids! - Not a ballerina! - He attacked me too! He teased me that I'm from a twisty stick home! I make twisty sticks for a living, that's what we are! I don't care, I just hate twistys! I've had it, where's my stick? Run away! Run, sumo wrestler! I'm tired of all the trouble you're getting into! - How could you hit your friend?! - Why are you hitting her?! Did I tell you to hurt him? Tell me why! Why is it always my fault?! His family goes camping every weekend! I'm the only one who has never gone camping! I'm the only one without a cell phone! I'm the only one who has never flown! My Wishes 1. Go camping 2. Cell phone 3. Overseas trip I hate dad... Sumo wrestler... What are you doing? What's up? What? I thought I could fix it up and get it working. But it's not going so well. Nari? Asleep. - Should we... - Yeah? just go? Where? Hawaii. I'm working so hard to be good to Nari, but I think I only made things hard for her. Wait, so we're really going to Hawaii! Baby, baby, baby! I'll do better, I really will! I will! I'm gonna keep my eyes on you. Yes, baby! For sure! I'll do my utmost... What's that sound? - Honey! - It's working! You fixed it! Genius! Super genius! We're going to Hawaii! Let's go! Glasses off, please. Smile please! Very good! One, two! Magnolia has resurfaced after 10 years. She'll be on a flight to Hawaii in 48 hours.

Obey mission parameters to the tee. Remember her face. If you act hastily, you will be killed. She must be captured alive, got that? Yes, comrade! Only speak Chinese during the mission. Get out. Listen, captain. I can't speak Chinese. Captain, I was in a rush to find operatives... He's technical support. I was told to just show up for work... Keep your mouth shut until end of the mission. How could I do that, the flight is so long... Of course, I'll do that. Have a great flight. Last call for check-in to Honolulu. I told you we should've taken a taxi! Which way?! Hawaii, Hawaii! Where is it?! Dad! Over there! Over there! Honey, run! I'm so sorry! - Please! - No! Wait! Wait! Wait! Please! Don't close! Check us in! Welcome. You're quite late. - I'm really sorry. - So sorry about that. - We should've taken a cab. - We got no money for that. I have to check if boarding is possible. No, we have to go on this trip! We have to fly! Allow me to check... Has the gate closed? I see, thank you. The gate has not closed yet, you can still board. Oh my god! Thank you! Nari, we can go on this trip! We should've taken a cab! There are 2 business seats available, can I upgrade your seats? - Are you serious? - No, we can't pay for it. Honey, shush, it's all free... It's fine, we'll take the economy seats. Ma'am. The upgrade is free. Freebie! - Honeybun, bargain! - That's insane! You're late, please run! My luggage here, honey, run! Have a great flight! Okay! OK! MADAM - Sweetie, see you later! - Dad, bye! May I check your boarding pass? Over here, ma'am. This is your seat. Nari, go ahead. Ladies and gentlemen, this is Air Hawaii... Good to meet you, ma'am. I'm head flight attendant KIM Hye-eun. Flight prep again today, no suspicious personnel. But the suspicious ones will try to act normal. I mustn't let my guard down because I'm a pro. As a pro, what are you doing here, Mr. JUNG? Yoon-jung is serving clients over there by himself, I can't let my guard down even a moment with you! Ms. KIM, it's not that. To ensure safe flight today, I have to double check for any suspicious... Just stop it, stop it! Go assist Yoon-jung in 1 second. But I... - 1 second! - 1 second... Excuse me? Yes, ma'am, how can I help you? Good morning. I'm sorry, we should've taken a cab, but we took a bus, so we got here late. My apologies. Baby, AHN Sera got hurt while filming a movie. AHN Sera? She's cute. Yeah? Not really, I heard she got fixed up. And her boobs are fake. I heard they're hers. - What? How do you know? - Are you a doctor? Uh, not really... That cover... Director? Holy cow! He shot that movie with AHN Sera! HA054, runway 4, ready for... Mom, when do we take off? Nari, try whistling. When passengers whistle, the airplane flies. - Really? - Sure! Liar! You get to have a baby in the States because of us. - You know that? - Yes, mother. But flying in the final month is... I did it too. Just listen to your mother-in-law. Excuse me. Lean the chair back. Baby will be comfy when the mother is. Okay. We'll be taking off shortly, could you return the seat to upright position? Thank you. - Hey, water. - Right away, sir. - Deputy. - Yes, councilor. How can I make this bigger? Like this. Runway clear. Final clear. Runway holding position sign check, 3-3 left. Ladies and gentlemen, this is the captain speaking. Thank you for flying with Air Hawaii today. I have fear of flying, and he still sends me there. Doesn't that confirm his animosity towards me? Seriously... I have to hang up, I'll call you in Hawaii. I'll take enough to kill me. Please switch your phone to airplane mode. Could you switch to airplane mode? - Good to go? - Yes, sir. Let's fly. Mom, look! Those are clouds! So pretty! Beautiful! I have a water towel for you. It's hot, be careful. Thank you. What kind of snack would you like? I'm fine. Certainly. It's hot, be careful. What kind of snack would you like? - This and a Coke. - Right away, miss. Nari, are you hungry? I should've packed twistys. Excuse me, how much is that? It's free, ma'am. - Really? - Yes. Then could I get the same one? Sure, right away. This is so, so, so great! Check if Magnolia is among the passengers. May I offer you a drink? Could I get an Erdinger? Right away, sir. Did you check for nut allergy? 18A and 51C are allergic. Sir, do you need anything? Washroom is that way. I'll take you there. Dammit... What is it?! I'm sorry, I... Why did you touch my face! Who the hell? Ma'am, it's macadamia that you req... Nari! Ma'am, what do you do? Action star? Martial artist? Or an NIS agent? NIS? National Intelligence Service. Come on now. I'm a Youngcheon ma... What? Mayor? Mayor... Mr. JUNG? Why are you harassing a passenger? Ms. KIM, that lady is the mayor of Youngcheon! What? Mayor! Mayor! What's with them? Jesus... Was I right? She's just a housewife. You overheard passengers talk politics and thought one of them was a minister! He was in economy, but she's in business! Why can't a housewife be a mayor too? Your dialect! I told you watch it! Swap with Ji-yoo in economy. - Ms. KIM... - Swap! Of course. I'm watching you. Let's get to Hawaii without incidents! - Go to business. - Me? - Are you flying alone? - Pardon? Me? No, I'm with my family. She must be your wife. I'm sorry... No, my family is in business class. - Oh yeah? - Yup. - You got separated? - I guess so. - And you, sir? - I'm flying alone. I'm flying out to see my daughter and granddaughter. I have to fly out to them because I miss them. My tummy... I'm really sorry... Oh my... I know you're occupied, but how much longer? 7 more hours. What? 7 hours?! Ma'am, that's not the washroom. It's an emergency... Nari, I have to go to the washroom... Action flick again? Stop watching that. Mom! I'll be right back, okay? You're done, right? Let's give some to dad. I'll be back. It's coming... There is another washroom over there. - Over there? - Yes. Mayor! Please don't call me that, it's quite embarrassing. We're in public, I apologize. If you need anything, don't hesitate to ask. You're very prudent. You're too kind, sir. Since it's a long flight, let's have a chat. Chatting is good, I love to listen, sir. When I was conceived, she had a dream, she saw an endless rice field... This chat is endless... Sir, could you take your seat? I'm sorry, sir, I'm really sorry. Sir, could you scooch over? Where was I? Honey? The thing about rice is, as it ripens, it bends down, but one of them still stood high! That's when she knew! 'Oh! He'll be an oblivious boy!' Very interesting... Did you see a tall, handsome man? Honey, hey! Sweetie! - Weren't you lonely? - No, no, no! - Aren't you bored? - I'm fine. - My tummy... - This is my wife. - Good day, sir. - Hello... Eat some of this, it's macada... Ow, my tummy... Could you go up and check on Nari? Sweetie, I'll be back. She must be in a hurry. People ground flights for this stuff... Sir, try this and wait for me, I'll be right back. I'm sure you'll be bored, just hang in there. It's fine! How did it go? I don't think she's on this side. What did he say? Sorry, sir. I'll look around again, check the front... Sorry, stomach troubles... Are you all waiting? Yes, lady, it's full. Oh my gosh... It's an emergency... Get in line. Why is everyone pooping on this flight? My tummy... Here is your daughter. Business class sure is different. Kiddo, I... Manner, manner. Gosh, okay, okay! Wait, we were supposed to watch this together! - Don't tell mom. - Secret. Magnolia has not blossomed in economy, and we couldn't check business yet. We need more time. Forget it. Initiate the op. Initiate the op. Fucking hell... We're texting mission directives in Chinese too? Mission? Ladies and gentlemen, please return to your seats. We are currently experiencing turbulence due to change in weather. - Return to your seats. - Ms. KIM! Ms. KIM! Please put on your seatbelts. I heard it myself! Stuff about texting, and mission! Something is seriously up! Stop fooling around, you heard the captain, make sure passengers are seated during turbulence. I'll get you some tissue. Come on... This is the real deal. There are so many suspicious men! Buddy! You thick idiot, you wanna get fired? No... Get it together! We'll talk further once we land. What did I come here for? Right, tissue. Now! You idiot. This is all wrong... Fasten your seatbelt. Sir, it's dangerous. Please remain in your seat... Sir, please return to... Heads down! Hands up! Didn't you hear him?! From here on, we are in charge. Excuse me? Didn't you hear a scream? - I'll go check right away. - Okay. It's not a scream, probably a fight broke out. Economy's like that, it's like a slum. Move faster! Heads down! Even the scent is luxurious. Hands up and heads down. Heads down! Close the window! Close the damn windows! Open up. Captain, hijack in progress. Now! This is HA054, this is... No, captain! No! Oh no... Empty? Change route at once. - Hands in the air! - Now! Do it! Search the entire plane. What are you doing? Search at once! What are you doing there? - Don't kill me... - Get out! It locked up? Anyone outside? Comrades? You sons of bitches! Let's negotiate. We got no business with you. Stop wasting time and state your demands. Money? What do you want? Why are you trying to kidnap a Korean congressman? Congressman? Why should I clean up your country's mess? Are you spies from the North? Congressman! Asshole. You mustn't utter whatever's on your mind. Who do you think you're talking to?! I'm JANG Pil-joon! No good trash, get rid of him. Did I ask for your name? - Get up! - I'm not going! - Mother! - I'm not gonna go! - I won't! Stop! - Goddammit! I won't! Mother! Let go of me! If I have to die, I'll die in business class. Knife... - Are you out of your mind? - Oh my gosh... Mother! Mother! That felt good. North or South, all women hate mother-in-laws. NIS Safe House South Korea Airplane hijack? Are you kidding me? Thankfully, we have an agent onboard. Hey buddy, get up. Get the hell up! Drag him away. Toss him! Sit him down. This is your seat. I'll now start the briefing, this is the situation. Next slide. Air Hawaii flight HA054 that departed Incheon at 1905 hours was hijacked by unidentified men. Current location? It has changed its route. - Suspects? - We're confirming it, sir. Neutralize the situation before other agencies get involved. Get constant reports from our agent onboard. Of course, sir. No Service Get the hell up. Hey, don't look at me, I'll scoop your eyes out. You think I'm kidding? Don't hurt me! The baby will be in shock! Dad, I don't see mom. You're right. Sir? Did you see my wife by any chance? I don't think so. Why won't this go in? My money! Stop crying and sit down. Keep your heads up so we can see you. We have a suspect. Name, CHOI Gui-soon. She entered South Korea disguised as a Chinese, but she was found to be a North Korean defector, and has been categorized as a person of interest. A defector? We may have overlooked a crucial intel about her. She was a top overseas operative, who suddenly disappeared about 10 years ago. She's incredible. Can our agent handle her? We'll know soon enough. Oh jeez! Who's in there? Come on out! Why is he so rude? Coming right out! It's been a while. Magnolia. I'm coming out... Hey, what are you doing?! - Get out! - Stop! Please! Airplane Hijack Suspect Who's that woman? This is CHOI today. - They're the same person? - Yes, I think so. That makes sense? Yes, this is Korea after all. Who are you? It's really not her? Let go, are you nuts? I just bought this... So embarrassing... AHN Sera?! Jesus, isn't she in the hospital? Oh man, I can't believe I get to meet AHN Sera here... It's an honor... - Don't touch me... - You know her? Are you blind? She's the hottest actress in all of South Korea... Oh wait. Could we take a selfie? Now? Could you take the pic? Hello? Hello? Hey, wake up! My gosh, he's a goner... Excuse me? I didn't mean to do that, I was just startled... This is really bad... This is nuts, my instinct had to kick in! Magnolia, remember my voice? It's me, LI Cheol-seung. Gui-soon, that op is a trap. Get out of there at once. Infiltrate to South Korea and hide your identity. Don't trust anyone, and be happy... Live a happy life. LI Cheol-seung... Magnolia! Magnolia! Come on out! So many are inconvenienced for one person! - Did you see AHN Sera? - AHN Sera? - AHN Sera! - Where? Be quiet! I won't let this slide, I'm JANG Pil-joon! Is he an actor too? He's a congressman! - Sit down. - I'm sitting down. - Who are they? - They're North Koreans. North Koreans? I just wanted my grandchild to have American citizenship... He may end up being a North Korean instead... - What are you staring at? - Where's mom? I'll bring mom back, don't you worry. - Excuse me, sir. - Cell phones out. - Could you... - Hurry up. watch my child for a second? - Okay. - Heads down. Nari, stay with this man, I'll go find mom. Okay, come back soon. All right. It's AHN Sera! If you stir trouble, I'll make an example of him. So beautiful... I was watching your movie. Stop talking. What are you doing here... Hurry up. I'm sorry! Baby, where are you? Give me the passenger list. - It's a privacy matter... - We don't release private info. Yeah? Then you can bring it. Get up! Ms. KIM! Help! - Get up! - Ms. KIM! - No! - Back off! - Ms. KIM! - Come here! But I'll get fired! Ms. KIM, save me! I didn't even get a selfie with AHN. Ms. KIM, help! Please save me! Lead the way. Don't kill me! I knew something like this would happen. Shut your mouth and keep looking. Okay, just wait a moment. Am I sweating or crying? Are you out of your mind? No, of course not. Could it be here? Where... where could it be... Stop. Why are you keep rolling your eyeballs? You keep seeing a ghost? - Mayor! - Shush! You shouldn't have stared back at me. You're so oblivious. That was amazing! That hurts... Will you be quiet? Don't tell anyone about this. This is between... JUNG Hyun-min Hyun-min and me, okay? Okay. - How many outside? - About 7! 7... 8, 9... 10? I'm not sure. That's vital information... Where's the passenger list he was looking for? Oh, that? Right here! Privacy of our passengers is our top secret. What are you doing? Do you have a plan? Save the plane. Nice! Jesus Christ, you look natural in it! - Keep this for me. - Sure thing. Don't ever lose it. Sure! What is it? We're on the same team, we have to save it together. I know this airplane inside and out. There are many makeshift weapons in the cargo bay. I'll go fetch some. Good, that's a great idea. Wait... My dreams was to become a secret agent. If something happens, call me through this. When in danger, punch the neck region! You can knock out most people like that, okay? Okay! Let's go. Where was this bitch hiding? I don't go easy on women. Where are you going? Hawaii. Your reputation precedes you. LI Cheol-seung... Dude, it's me. We have a situation. Air Hawaii HA054, hijacking! Perps are North Korean operatives. About 15 members. Leader is LI Cheol-seung. NIS agent? Not a peep. You there! Where did you come from? What exactly are you doing by yourself? Why did he leave Nari alone? Is she a flight attendant?! She's so cool, she's my style. Retired agent mustn't get involved. Don't get involved? He thinks I'm still his underling? Would you stay back in this situation? Mr. Agent, we have a third member, one sec. Mayor! Mayor, I got good news, we got another teammate. Where are you? What is it? - What the hell is that? - Why is the voice weird? Agent, agent! Same team. - Hello? - Who's this? - That's state secret. - Say what? Your active period? Don't be rude, do you know me? Maybe you're not aware, so I'll say this just once. There are a few principles to suppressing terrorism. First, build an intelligence gathering network on foes. Second, secure a safe exfil for the hostages. - Third... - Weirdo. Exclamation mark, exclamation mark. Weirdo? Hello? Hello? She hung up. Is he suffering verbal diarrhea? Weirdo, eh? What's the third principle? I got a mission to get to. His wife must have her hands full with him. So that's how you want to do this? Let's see what you look like. Let's check you out. You disguised as a female? You do it your way, and I'm gonna spread my wings. Remain on course. - Doesn't work. - Go back! Manual controls don't work for some reason. Move. It's a taser. So cool... That's... We knew you'd come out of hiding. Magnolia. Why are you hiding your face? Get up. Middle age woman? So? You got a problem? Magnolia... LI Cheol-seung. Thought I wouldn't find you if you go into hiding with a new face? Honeybun? I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Baby? What are you doing? What's with those clothes? You got the wrong person. No way, she's my wife, I'll bring her. Honey, you look hot in flight attendant uniform... This bastard is an NIS agent. Honey... You were in hiding with protection from NIS? Hands up, heads down! Mom? Move! Oh no, what do I do? This is bad... Should I go back? I can't turn around, I have to go forward. Hello. Don't cry, sweetie, it'll be okay. Why are you crying? I wasn't crying. Who are you with? Tell me, where's your mom? Right here. Me? No... - You had a kid?! - Director? No way, what are you saying? A daughter?! Kid, why am I your mom? AHN Sera, mother, that's AHN Sera. That kid is AHN's? Mom, stop it. Stop what? You stop! She said AHN's her mom! I'm not, I'm still single. Don't misunderstand. Kiddo, you'll get in trouble if you lie. I don't want to lie that I don't have a mom! Do you know how I feel? I'm angry! I'm super angry! Please help me... Mom... Sit, sit. You shouldn't do that! She is my daughter. Sir! Sir! - Director! - Is he okay? Is he dead? You really were an NIS agent? No, I was with them for a brief period. Have you been surveilling me? Yeah, I was at first. Remember chicken skewer? I was filling in for a colleague, so I went, and... there you were... I will, sir! Get it together... I will, sir. Why is he looking at me so fondly? - Dammit! - She's just so pretty... You faggot! Help me! I work for the government, I'm civil servant level 6... Don't harass poor people! Piss off, go away! Piss off! That's when... Are you okay? you appeared before me. I made this, would you like to try? I was told you were vicious, but you weren't at all. Light emanated from your face. That's when I knew. You were my better half I've been looking for. That's when I gave up NIS, to reappear before you as an upstanding man. Are you okay that I'm Magnolia? Of course. I don't care who you were, or what you did. You are my only wife and our daughter's mother. Are you suddenly moved? - Baby... - Yeah? - I want to see your face. - Here, over here. I want to see you... Honey... Honey, what's that? Christ! Who the hell? Director, shouldn't we do something with this? Sir, sir? Do I see teeth? You think we're kidding around? Open your mouth once more, I'll put a hole in your head. What do you want?! Please sit down. Wrap it up, get the parachutes. This is my real plan. What? I'll exfil with Magnolia. You go down with this plane into the ocean. This is a civilian plane, will you kill them all? Why should I care? More civilians are killed then soldiers in war. I'm exchanging her for a fat check. Honey! Mi-yeong! Fasten your seatbelts! Can't they fight outside? Jeez... Stop it. Engage auto pilot. Can't we all get along? Mi-yeong, you okay? I wasn't gonna say this, but I gave up $90,000 salary to marry you. Change route and drop to 8,000 feet. $8,000 a month? 8,000? He gave that up?! No, that's too dangerous. This is even more dangerous. After taxes, it's only $50,000. Okay, okay, I'll do it. $8,000 a month! $8,000! One moment please. Attention please. The aircraft will be descending rapidly. Please fasten your seatbelt. My neck, my neck! Baby, my neck! - Sir, seatbelt please! - That's not the problem! - The aircraft will descend... - Fasten your seatbelt! Hey, you there, get me the captain! Are you ignoring a Korean congressman?! Sera, are we gonna die? No, we can't die like this. You can fight really well. Can't you rescue my mom and dad? I'll make you happy. Wait a minute, aren't you the leader? In the film, everything's fake except my face. Someone else was fighting. Oh my! No! Hold up... Buddy, get away from her! - Piss off! - Hold up, come on! I can't move! I can't breathe... Hold on... Please... Why did you come after me? Yeah, man. I got an order from my government. They want you back because there are men who are after the sealed nuclear warhead plan by your father. If that plan is released, the world will turn into hell. I have to stop that. So... what's that got to do with me? Yeah. To unseal that, we need your iris. Buddy, don't look at her with puppy eyes, look away! How dare you look at her with those big eyes! Baby, don't look at him! But my men backstabbed me and plans to sell you off. What? They'll sell my wife?! Those sons of bitches! Where are they?! - Honey! - I've had it! - Honey! - What?! Be quiet, I can't think straight, please be quiet. I'm sorry. Say what? You understand the situation now? If they take you away, you're as good as dead. What?! They'll kill her?! Fat chance, no way in hell! How could I believe you? You tried to kill me back then. Gui-soon. Get out of there. Men are there to take your life. Father... Weren't you trying to kill me too? I was always curious, why you shot me. I couldn't trust anyone. You and I never had that trust? "You and I"? Don't you dare say that! Why couldn't you be honest with me? Who am I talking with? You saw who they were shooting at, I needed to buy time. I really wanted to save you. Why do you need to save her, she's got me! How did you two get up?! Hold on... Mr. Secret Agent, I'm here! We have to go whip Lego Head! I raised him well. Come on, hurry. We have to save the plane! We'll be arriving shortly. We only take Magnolia. - Prepare the chutes. - Right away. Move aside! Stop moving around! Control panel. Red cable to third socket. Yellow cable to second socket. Secured! Let's get the show on the road. Okay! This brings back memories. You were the only one who always had my back. Am I right? What's that bastard trying to do with my wife? My first impression is never wrong. I never like that Lego Head. Don't pull that crap on me. My back belongs to someone else now. Me. Mom! That's my mom! - Mom! Mom! - Mom? Mom! Yeah, that's a real mom. Hey! Get in here! Over here! Go, mom! - Mom! - Nari! - Are you hurt? - No. - Are you okay? - I'm fine. My daughter... I'll take care of the bad guys and come back. - Do you trust me? - Yeah. - Okay? - Okay. Why did she call you mom? Ow, my heart... To help the kid... Anyone there? We wouldn't have saved the plane without you. Mission complete. Nari, shall we go see your mom? Yes. Okay, this way. By the way, why do you speak disrespectfully to her? Did you call her Gui-soon? Show her some respect, she's 4 years older than me! You don't even know your wife's age? She and I were born on the same year, 1981. What? 1981? Not 1975? Buddy... Baby, what's this about? Weren't you born in 1975? - I have to go see Nari... - So who's 1981... Mom! Nari! What was that? Defectors... How could you achieve greatness with that mentality? Magnolia, you're coming with me. You don't care if your daughter dies? Don't you dare threaten me. Just kill me already. Mom! If you want to save her, put this on. Your father gave up his life to save you, - Nari, it's okay. - but you can't? - It's okay. - Your call. Free the child, if not, I won't go. You won't? Let's all die then! This airplane will explode soon. Your threats don't work on me, let the child go! If you go, we all get to live! What's there to think? See? They only care about their own lives. If you don't, they'll die because of you! Your kid and husband too. Nari, it's okay, you'll be fine... I'm gonna go, I'm going. Honey, you can't go, don't go! It's okay, baby. No, don't go! Honey!

We have to go to Hawaii! Honey, wake up! Open your eyes! You can't do this, get up! - Dad! - Wake up! Get up! Ow, my mother had a dream, and said the baby will be so oblivious... Honey... That's not me! - I'm right here! - Honey! Am I alive?! Honey! - Thank god! - I'm alive! Thank you! Thank you so much! I found this. You watched too many K-dramas. I don't wear stuff like this! You good? I'm fine. Are you happy? Enough to be thankful to be born. Have a good life. CHOI Gui-soon. You too, Cheol-seung. Take good care of Gui-soon. Gui-soon? Why are you asking me to take care of my woman? She's not Gui-soon, she's Mi-yeong! I'll take care of my woman, so go away! Go! I'll see you after reunification. It won't happen, go, asshole! Holy crap! Ms. KIM? Yes? Are you all right? How could I be? Why did you open the door? He had a gun on you... You still shouldn't have opened the door, captain! Sweetie, I was really scared.

Our airplane is... turning around back to Incheon Airport. - Excuse me, captain? - Yes? Can't you let us fly to Hawaii? Our honeymoon was in Bugok Hawaii, but we have to go to Hawaii no matter what. - Honeybun, stop... - Hold on, we have to go. Stop it! Captain, I'm begging you, please go to Hawaii. Screw Hawaii! Don't you see that hole? You're all dead when we get back! What a geezer... I'm JANG Pil-joon! Sir, please sit down... Screw turning back! We have to go to Hawaii no matter what! Don't you dare bark at third term congressman! What a load of shit! Screw you and your congressman crap! Why didn't it work? Are you all nuts?! The hijacking, all our trouble was because of that woman! Buddy, why is that important?! If it wasn't for her, we'd all be dead! Am I right, everyone? She's right! How dare you! Congressman! Where did you get that? You're killing me here, dipshit! Is he dead? Hawaii! Hawaii! This is HA054, situation report. Due to low fuel, we'll proceed to Hawaii. This is your captain speaking. We'll be landing in our original destination, Honolulu Airport. Aloha! - Keep it safe. - Okay! How did you know the teddy bear was a bomb? I'm Magnolia. It's the ocean! I can't tell which is the flower. So beautiful. Honey. Mi-yeong, thank you for marrying me. I worked my butt off to do this. It took 10 years to save up for this trip. - 10 years? - Yeah, I... Wait, what did you say? So, did you all plan this? You know how I feel, right? Are you nuts? But it's so much money! Mi-yeong, I love you! I don't believe it! Call me honeybunbun, I love you!
