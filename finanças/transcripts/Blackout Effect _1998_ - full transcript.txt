Catherine called. - Catherine? Catherine Parmel? - Yeah. What'd she want? She didn't say. Are you still seeing each other? No. She moved to Atlanta. What'd she say? She wanted to know if you're gonna be home this weekend. And you said? You're seeing her. No, I am not seeing her. - What'd you tell her? - I told her that... I thought you'd be around. So do you want me to go back to Des Moinesand finish this up? No. Just get a statement from the maintenance crew and close it. I need that file by next week. How do you run out of fuel? Karen. Mack.

You're regular and... - Decaf. - God. I knew that. - I knew that. - We're going the wrong way. Jack. I need fifteen, I can't handle ten mile spacing. I've got severe turbulence into Chicago. We need to be slowing traffic down, not speeding it up. Alright, fine. D.C. central flow has ordered ten mile spacing. Ten? Frank, we're backed up as it is. I've gotta pull some of these guys off soon. Just do it. Where the hell is Drake? Harold, you know the rules. Henry, you son of a miserable pissant... pain in the ass. Come on.

We're gonna get you out of here, okay? Okay, thanks, Karen. Mr. Wyatt, I'm going to take Henry to a hotel... - get him away from the press. - They're already... outside the facility. Take Henry into the conference room. I'll arrange transportation later. Get a statement. Henry. It's okay. You don't have to do this now. - I'll help you with it later, okay? - Okay. Okay. - I gotta go call my kids. Okay? - Don't go, Karen. - Don't leave me, Karen. - I'm not gonna leave you. I just have to go call my kids, okay? - Okay. - Okay. Karen, what happened to the plane? Why won't anybody tell me what happened to the planes? God, no. God, no. No! God, no. Get a large building or factory as close to the site as possible. Use it as a temporary morgue. Move bodies only. Don't touch the wreckage till I say so. What? Yeah, it could be an air traffic control problem. Make sure the controller at Midwest is secured. Get his name... his statement, have the F.A.A. test him for drugs and alcohol. - I'll check in later. - Who's missing? Kim Garfield. I spoke to her a half hour ago. She was at a conference in New York. - She'll meet us in Chicago. - Does she know this is my case? She does now. She wasn't too happy about it. That's just too bad, isn't it? - Yes. More this way. - In here? I'll meet you on board. - I don't wanna see this. - Alright. We got a family here. - How long? - Please. My God! Come on. Who's on that plane? You'll all know as soon as I know. If you need to make a call. We'll have phones set up in fifteen minutes. Looks pretty bad. There's the cockpit. - John Dantley. - Jack Colson. - Kim Garfield, Paul Roth. - Jack Colson. - Search and Rescue. Listen. - Hi, it's nice to meet you. We gotta hike in a ways to the crash site. It's just up over that crest, so follow me and I'll take ya up. Alright, we think the left wing... clipped the top of these tall trees here. We've got the main impact area here. Let's go. Kim, note this. It looks like complete destruction of the aircraft... behind the cockpit with subsequent post-crash fire. Jack, get the local police. I want that area below the ridge sealed off. N.T.S.B. only. No press, no public. Just Search and Rescue. How many bodies have we recovered so far? We got seventy. Let's start documenting the wreckage. Find the tail section wherever the hell that is. Get the black box. Guess we'll start over here... - with the cockpit first. - Mr. Dantley. - Yeah? - I'm Stephen Royer. F.A.A. Regional Director. - Hello. - Look I know... Hi. I know you people at N.T.S.B. don't like to speculate. But it's been six hours since this crash occurred. - Nobody's talked to the press. - We don't speculate. Look, we got rumors on the Internet. The Mayor has publicly condemned... - the air traffic control system. - We don't speculate. I'm not asking you to do that. But two planes... flying into each other is not supposed to happen. Now, there are a lot of people out there... that are very nervous. I just need... - some reassurance from your... - I'll tell you what. If you wanna reassure somebody... why don't you go and talk to some of the families of the victims? Okay? - That's not what I'm here for. - Let me work with him. - We don't work for the airlines. - I said... - We don't work for the F.A.A. - "with him." I'm not... - Let's... Everyone's got... - Look, he's... an agenda right now. Let's just be clear about what ours is. Alright? Kennedy just arrived at International Here's the passenger list for Global. How many on board? A hundred and eighty-two on Global. Three on P.D.O. When you're ready, we can check out the cockpit. John, you alright? Is something wrong? - Catherine was on this flight. - Catherine? Catherine Parmel? Are you sure? I just spoke to her this morning. I've no comment. I'm meeting my chief investigator now. I'll be happy to answer questions later. We haven't interviewed the controller at Midwest yet. But we're looking into the possibility that there may... have been a mis-communication between him and the pilot. It's up to you, if you want to release that to the press. Right now our priority is the recovery of... - the bodies of the victims. - Do we expect any survivors? It'd be a miracle. Kim will brief you daily. Alright, it's very late. I think we should all try and get some sleep. Excuse me, sir. I... I need to disclose something to you. I knew one of the victims of this crash, a flight attendant. John, I'm sorry. Why didn't you say something? Was she a close friend? Yeah. She was someone I was seeing in D.C. but we'd stopped seeing each other well over a year and half ago. I think you should recuse yourself. - I agree. - Kim can take care over. - She's a senior investigator, - I'd rather not. I'd like to... - and you can go back to D.C. - stay on. I can handle... the investigation, sir. I don't believe that my having known this woman... will in any way interfere with... - my ability to do my job. - You don't think ... - it poses a conflict? - No, sir, I do not. - Come on, John. - It's not a conflict for me. And frankly, I don't think that anyone else... - even has to know about it. - The last thing that... we need is the appearance that this investigation's been... - compromised. - Give me a little credit - will you? - The appearance, John. Okay. Look, you can stay on. But if it becomes a conflict, professionally, emotionally. I want you to recuse yourself. - I will. - Now, I'm gonna trust you on this. It won't be a conflict, sir. Thank you. I promise. - Hello. - Hi, Lori, it's John Dantley. I don't know if you know this or not, but... but Catherine was on flight 1025. I know. I just wanted to tell you how sorry I was. I can't... I can't talk to you right now, John. Yeah, Lori, do you know what she was doing on a flight to D.C.? I'm sorry, I've to go. Wait, Lori? After being brought to... - an undisclosed hotel last night... - Yeah. - air traffic controller... - Okay, good. - Henry Drake arrived home... - Alright, take one... - early this morning under... - and go. the watchful eye of... - news cameras and reporters. - The controller's name is... Henry Drake. Neighbors describe him... as a quiet introspective man who keeps to himself. Even his next door neighbor didn't know his name. He's forty-six years old, unmarried, mechanical engineering... - graduate of Purdue University. - Electrical engineering! Right now he's inside his house. Look, you people are getting it... - all wrong. - Mr. Drake, would you like... - No. I've been told... - to make a statement? - that specifically I cannot talk... - Was it controller error... - to anybody. - that caused this crash? - No. I can't hear. - Was there a mis-communication? - You're all talking at once. - Global had turbulence in the area. But weather doesn't seem to be a factor. Our priority is radar and voice communication... between the pilots and air traffic control. Here's what I want. Controller tapes from the facility... cockpit voice recorder, and the flight data reorder. Also, find out if that cargo plane... had a collision avoidance system on board. - Why wouldn't it? - Not an F.A.A. requirement. Kim, I want a look at all the medical and... training records on that controller. Interview his friends, family other controllers working with him at the time. Anyone. We'll meet here every morning at 8.00am sharp for updates. No one speaks to the press. Understood? Alright. That's it. Let's remember why we're all here. We might actually learn something from all this. Thank you. I got that D.O.S.T.S. John, about last night, I apologize. But I had to call it the way I saw it. I understand. Do we know where the controller is? - Right behind you. - I cannot talk about that. I can't explain that to you. I cannot talk to you. First of all. I'm forty-eight, right? I'm not forty-six. And second of all, it's an electrical engineering degree - not a mechanical engineering degree - I spoke to one of the F.A.A... supes off the record about this guy. Management's been trying to fire him for the last five years. - Why? - Personality conflicts. He files complaints compulsively. - About what? - Equipment malfunctions... union grievances. According to them, he looks for problems. This could be a very short investigation. There's the post-computer, there's the C.D.C., and there's... - the direct access radar. - Can we come in and talk to you... - inside your house? - No, you can't come in... - my house. - Contact Frank Wyatt. He's the facility manager at Midwest. - I want him to work with us on this. - No, I'm sorry. Don't you think the facility manager might have an agenda here, John? No, not him. - He's an old friend. - Frank, good to see you. It's been a long time, John. I'm honored that you brought me in... - on the investigation. - No one else knows... - the facility better than you do. - Well... this has sure turned us upside down. Twenty-two years and not one black mark. Just be a minute, Henry. How many planes were you in communication with... at the time of the accident? - Ten. - And how long... had you been on your scope? About two hours and thirty-five minutes. I wish I could hear what the hell he was sayin' in there. He's sayin' I worked him overtime yesterday. Him and ten other guys. Drake is not ten other guys. - He's gonna blame me. - And I handed him off... too many planes. He could say anything he wants to. The truth is, he screwed up, right? - Yes, he did. - Guys, we don't know that. Karen, I saw that cargo jet on my screen... and I saw it on his screen, okay? You saw it, right? I don't know, man. Don't say you don't know. We gotta get the story straight. - I'm just a trainee. - No. You're there. - I think I should go to the shrink. - Shrink? This has got nothin' to do with a shrink. This is about what you saw. Now, what I saw were two planes on a collision course... that Drake did not separate in time. When did you first encounter the P.D.O.'s? P.D.O. was westbound at 21,000 feet... and requested permission to climb to 28,000. Didn't you see tine P.D.O. climbing into Global at 26,000 feet? When I climbed P.D.O., Global was not a factor. I had sufficient separation. Obviously, I didn't see P.D.O. climb into Global. - Why not? - P.D.O. data block... disappeared from my screen. - Why did you take... - Excuse me. What do you mean it disappeared? Before the collision, I had a glitch. A blackout on my screen. After the blackout, the data block vanished. So you're telling us you never even saw the P.D.O. at 26,000 feet. The data block came back on my screen just before the collision. How long was your screen blacked out? Two, maybe three seconds. And did the outage occur in the entire facility? I've no way of knowing that. According to the preliminary report, there was no blackout reported. Did the supervisor see it? - I haven't spoken to the supervisor. - Did you alert your supervisor? I requested an unsatisfactory... - condition report. - But to your knowledge... he didn't see it happen? Did anyone see it? I'm telling you, I had a blackout on my screen! I tried to establish radio contact with the P.D.O. but I didn't see it! You didn't see it... - or it wasn't there? - It wasn't there. Alright, let's go back to the instructions... - that you gave 1025. If I may? - Please. T-CAS, the pilot's on-board warning device... indicated conflicting traffic to 1025 and instructed the pilot to descend. But you denied his request and told him to maintain altitude. - It's correct? - I had other traffic. I didn't know where the P.D.O. jet was. Why would you climb P.D.O from 21 to 28 when you had a 757 at 26? I've warned this facility about the sub-standard equipment we have. I've warned this facility about deficiencies in the system. Radar blackouts, communication outages. I've telephoned the F.A.A. Administrator's hotline. I filed two unsatisfactory condition reports... in the last two months on the very same scope... - I was using! - Answer his question, Henry. Why'd ya climb P.D.O. from 21,000 feet to 28,000 feet... when you had a 757 at 26? I told you the Global's not a factor. I could see both of those planes. So you became confused when P.D.O. as you allege, disappeared. No. Yes! Fie, yeah, I was confused! No, see what do you mean "allege?" you're putting words in my mouth now. I don't allege anything. The system... - is unsafe. It's in jeopardy! - According to the data we've... Henry, according to the data we've... you say one thing, the radar printout says another. You're confused and you contradieted the computer's instructions. Let's talk about that for a minute. It's accepted practice that if it's your word against the computer the computer has precedence. That's ludicrous! How can you give the computer precedence... when you can't even believe what it's saying? Ask the pilots. Even the T-CAS system makes mistakes sometimes. I warned you. Mr. Wyatt. I warned you! We've to trust the technology. You gave the pilot improper instructions. - Is that true or not true? - You're warned that... - this was gonna happen. - Is it true or not true? - You're warned! - Did you give the pilot... improper instructions? This is the scope that Drake used. He's finishing up a diagnostic check on it right now. Test panel looks okay. Character generator functions. Character gen... How old is this scope? - Older than you. - We're in transition. We're due for new equipment in two years. - So they say. - I've hooked into a sector... for the last five hours. This is the same traffic Drake had yesterday. It seems to be functioning fine. How long do you want me to stay on it? Five hours isn't long enough. Hook up a video monitor to it and record it. Drake says he reported two unsatisfactory condition reports... on this scope. I wanna see 'em. All the maintenance records, too. Did anybody touch this scope last night? I run the department. Nobody touched it. Let me know what happens. - What's Henry Drake's status here? - I'm sure... he'd like to have his job back, but he's not gonna get it though. I gotta find something else for him to do. - Union rules. - That glitch he talked about... the data disappearing from the screen that ever happen to you before? Not to my knowledge. I'll go through the reports and check. - Did you see the radar data? - Yeah, but that doesn't... prove him wrong. Missing data's not gonna show up on a radar report. We need the black box to show if there's a problem with the avionics. - How long has Drake worked here? - Twenty years. Most of my controllers burn out after ten... and move upstairs into management, but Henry, well, ya know. Henry Drake's not exactly what ya call management material. This equipment is what, 1960s' military? 1950s. My dad says you guys had more sophisticated equipment back... when you're in the Navy. There's nothing wrong with the technology, John. We may have a few more airplanes in the sky... but that's not the system's fault. It works. Yeah, Barbara, is he there? Yeah, sure. I'll hold. Hey, what'd you find out? Drake's scope checked out. Really? - What about those reports he filed? - They weren't there. - What do mean they weren't there? - They weren't there. The F.A.A. has no record of any unsatisfactory reports being filed... or any service on the scope in the last two months. That's weird. - Did we check the D.C. office? - It's not there. But I did find out something interesting. What? There're five power outages in the facility. Blackouts? Caused by? Software glitch, power interruption, stuck computer key... that one knocked him out for fifteen minutes. What's falling out of that helicopter? Flowers. From the families of the victims. That's as close as they could get. I saw Catherine a couple months ago. - I thought you guys broke up. - Yeah, we did. But I was in Atlanta, so I called her. We got together a couple times. It's great. I don't know why, maybe 'cause there was no pressure on us... or something, but it was really, really nice. I called her a couple of times when I got back to D.C., but... she never called me back. Mr. Dantley. Park that loader right here. - How many are there right now? - All done. - Bring it down. - Let's go. - How's that? - That's good. - Mr. Dantley. - I'm not supposed to talk to you. - I just want to talk. - You want this incident reported? It's not gonna help you out. Why won't anybody listen to me? I'm not crazy, I know what I saw. That plane was not on my scope. Did you find the unsatisfactory condition reports... - I filed? - They weren't there. - How? I filed those reports. - They weren't there. - They buried them. - Who? They'll bury reports. They'll do whatever... - they want! - Tell me something. How come... out of thirty-five unsatisfactory condition reports... filed in the last couple years, you filed thirty-two of 'em? Because I speak up. Just because you speak up doesn't mean anyone's gonna... - believe you - Listen. Could I look you in the eye like this if I killed all those people? Good night. Mr. Drake. A little higher. - John! - Yeah. - We found the black box. - They got it. - Traffic. - Now you can see the P.D.O... - Traffic. - approaching in the computer... - recreation. - Traffic. What the hell are they waiting for? Traffic, descend now. Traffic... The crew is getting impatient. The controller's telling the Global pilot to maintain... T-CAS is telling him to descend. The Global pilot's receiving conflicting commands. - Center, we've traffic somewhere. - Traffic, descend now. - T-CAS is telling us to descend. - Traffic, descend now. Traffic. - Negative, 1025, do not descend. - Traffic. - Maintain flight level 260. - Traffic, decend... Again the controller gives him the wrong command. P.D.O. cargo is now at twenty-five... and climbing directly into the path of the Global. - Center, we're not on visual. - Traffic, decend now. - Where's the traffic? - I don't see him. - Where's the P.D.0.? - Traffic, decend. The controller was keyed up on his mike. He seems irritated, confused, he cant find P.D.O... Or it's not on his screen. Or it's not on his screen. What we do know from the data... is that the P.D.O. cargo is almost at 26,000 feet. Now, somehow the controller realizes his mistake... and quickly tries to descend Global. Global 1025, traffic alert. Descend immediately to... - flight level 210. - 1025 expediting a descend. He was giving the right commands to Global. - But it's too late. - Traffic... - descend now. - We've impact. - What the hell was that? - That's not right. What we got here... - Traffic. Descend... - We're hit, man! We're hit! The next segment of this tape... is the cockpit recording after the collision. This isn't easy to listen to. Play it. Center, mayday, mayday! We're going down! - We're going down! - Something hit us back there! - This is Global 1025. - Traffic, decend now. - We're going down! - Talk to the cabin! Flight attendants, assume crash positions. - Traffic, desend now. - I can't hold it. Left rudder. - We're losing hydraulics! - On fire, engine two! - Blow the bottles! - Hang on! - I... - Pull it up. - Emergency request! Can't... - Traffic. God, I can't! Look at that form. Come on! - Score it. - I tried, man. It was... - Where are you goin'? - Goin' home to my kids. - Come on, one more. - Come on. - Tim wants you to stay. - No. I don't. See ya. Henry. I was gonna call you. Yeah, but you've been so busy. Don't do that to me. Sorry. But under the circumstances... I think that maybe an ounce of pity might be appropriate. Come on, Karen, I'm drownin' out here. That's ridiculous. There's no conspiracy. Everybody is just tryin' to cover their own ass. Karen, what do you think a conspiracy is? God! I file the complaints. I fight for the union, I put my ass on the line... for everybody else and who comes to my defense? Everybody is suffering. What did you guys say to the NTSB? Who? Lafia, Mack, Conners, you. I know you guys all talked. What did you say? This is great. You don't remember. Don't get sarcastic with me, Henry. You know we're not supposed to talk about... - what we said. - Karen, it's me for God's sake! I went through your divorce. - I know your children. - Henry, what do you... want me to do, lie? Whatever happened on your scope, I didn't see it! But ya know that what I'm talking about could've happened. Karen. Listen. I know it's hard for you to complain. But you've gotta speak up now! Those guys, they're not gonna do it. But you're not them. You've gotta speak up and tell people about the system. Henry... I'm not you. We can't keep the black box findings from the press. We've to release that information. - I agree. - I don't have a problem with that. I'll schedule a press conference in two days. Excuse me, but if you release this tape to the press... then the whole world's gonna think that Henry Drake was responsible... for the crash of 1025. Let's not kid ourselves here. These investigations are now... public trials played out in the media. We release these findings... - he's guilty. - John, we've listened to... all the tapes, we've analyzed all the data that we have... we've interviewed and re-interviewed anyone... who was even remotely attached to the crash. Now, yes the pilot will share some responsibility but the cold hard fact is Henry Drake... - did not see the cargo plane. - True. But he says that it wasn't there on his scope. How does that prove he's innocent? - How does that prove he's guilty? - You're lookin' to find... - some fault with the system. - No. - I'm not lookin' to find anything. - Look. If there is... even the slightest hint of a remote possibility... that there's something wrong with the air traffic control system... there'll be international repercussions. Yes, but what if there is something wrong with the system? What if it is flawed? And if that flaw still exists... what are we gonna do about it? Ignore it? - Wait for it to happen again? - Of course not. Then tell me how a guy with a fairly spotless record... over twenty years of experience as a controller... - puts two planes together. - His spotless record... and his experience are completely irrelevant. Alright. What about the unsatisfactory condition reports he filed? John, we've been over this before. They aren't there. - I looked for 'em myself. - So he's lying. We're not making a value judgement against this guy's character. Sure we are. That's exactly what we're doing. If those reports don't exist, then Drake is a liar. Have we double checked the maintenance logs? Double checked and triple checked. There've been no problems reported... with that scope for the last several months. Does anybody else have a bad feeling about this? John, I wanna get to the truth of this matter as much as you do... - as much as anybody. - How many blackouts... did your facility have last year? We've had occasional power failures. We installed... - new software, new equipment. - Yeah. But how many blackouts? - Five. We've a backup system. - And what happens... - if that backup system goes down? - It doesn't. - If. If it did. - John, this has absolutely... nothing to do with what happened to Henry Drake's scope. Five blackouts. Now, is that how many really happened or is that just... - how many gets reported? - If a power interruption duration... is less than one minute, no report is filed. - Why not? - Because it's not required by... federal air regulations, John. - I do not make the rules. - Why does it take something... like this to happen before the rules get changed? People... people die. John. You got a call. You need to go to the crash site right away. Believe it or not, we're almost two miles from the crash site. A couple a hikers found the bodies early this morning. We found the last six remaining bodies in this general area here. Where was Catherine Parmel's body found? I believe she was over here in this clearing. Who... Who was this she was with? 144, that would be, Paulette Oster. She was a little five year old girl. Her mother's body was already recovered, wasn't it? Yes, sir. Ya know, strangest thing her mother'sbody wasn't found anywhere in this area. We're pretty sure that she was holding on... to the little girl when the plane crashed. Excuse me, sir, if you don't mind me asking, did you... Did you know this woman somehow? Yeah. Listen, why don't you just take your time here and... if you need me. I'll be back at the truck. You okay? Yeah You know, you do this for ten years, you just... walk by these little flags... they're just bodies, not a life. It's... It's a little different when you know the person. You guys want kids, Paul? Yeah, we've talked about it. Catherine wanted kids. She wasn't sure when, but she knew she wanted them. I need to go home, take a couple days off. I promised Catherine's mom I'd bring her body back home to D.C. This isn't right. This just isn't right. John? - Lori. - Can we talk? It's about the best I can do. I haven't been home since I left for Chicago. Thanks. I spoke to Catherine's mom yesterday. I know. It really meant a lot to her that you could... bring Catherine's body back. Yeah You know I'm still a little confused. About what? About why she was on that flight. I know that D.C. wasn't on her route since she moved to Atlanta. I thought that maybe she was cornin' home... to visit her mom, but that wasn't it. No, she was coming here to see you. - Me? - There's something... I've to tell you. It was my fault. I was with Catherine in L.A. I switched flights with her and she took my route. I killed her. It should've been me. No. No. Don't say that. It shouldn't... - It shouldn't have been anyone. - I've to go. Wait. Why did she want to see me? It doesn't matter anymore. John, Mark. I've in my possession two tickets to the Redskins game. If you're interested, call me, okay? Hi, John, it's your mom. - Hi, Mom. - I know you're busy. Call me back when you've a chance. Dad and I're trying to make plans for Thanksgiving. - Yeah. - I love you. Bye. Hi, it's Catherine. I'm calling from L.A.X. and I... I've to see you. I've something I've to talk to you about... and I just... I wanna talk to you about it in person. I'm coming into D.C. tonight. I know you're in town, I called your office. I hope that was okay. I need to see you, John. Would you please be there for me? Tell me why she was coming to... - see me. - I don't know. Yes you do. Come on, why'd she wanna see me? - It doqesn't matter. - Why'd she wanna see me? - It doesn't matter. - It matters to me. Lori, come on. Please just... - Tell me. - She was pregnant. She loved you, John. She always loved you. Didn't you know that? John? John? Hi, it's Catherine. I'm calling from L.A.X. and I... I've to see you. I've something I've to talk to you about... I just... I wanna talk to you about it in person. I'm coming into D.C. tonight. I know you're in town, I called your office. I hope that was okay. I need to see you, John. Would you please be there for me? I used to work in maintenance. And, well technically. I'm not a controller just yet. - I'm still a trainee. - When do you start? In about an hour. A little nervous? I should actually get back out there. Did you ever service Henry Drake's scope? Any scope that came down to us was just a number. We checked it... repaired it if it needed repair and... logged it in the book. - This book, right? - Yes, sir. When you service a scope, it's logged into this, right? Yes, sir. Tell me, did anyone ever ask you... not to log something or to take something out? - No, sir. - Is it possible that a data block... can disappear from a radar screen? - It could. - How? The scope could overheat, maybe. That could cause the character generator to malfunction... that could cause the display to malfunction. Could I go now? How would we cause a scope to overheat? Just turn off the fan. Can I go now? Please? Yeah. How ya doin', buddy? Good. I'm good. First day pushin' tin. Ya nervous? No. I just dropped my pen. Let me tell you a secret and don't tell anybody here. My first week on the scopes puked my guts out for the whole week. Man, are you kiddin' me? This is a true story. Lighten up, rookie. Got an easy shift. Light traffic. No pressure. What'd he ask you about? - Who? - Who? The N.T.S.B. - You're just upstairs. - Nothin', man. It was just maintenance stuff. Rock steady. You'll do fine. You nervous about the job or... - did somethin' happen up there? - I... - I'm not nervous. - Confidence, man. That's what this job is all about. You get into a rhythm... - and you're in control. - You're in control. No, you're in control. - I'm in control. - That's right. See ya on the floor. I'm in control. I'm in control. Make six copies of these arrival route maps... and then distribute them to the appropriate control stations. And then come back. Don't you use the same maps every week? - Yes. - Why not make six hundred copies? And then you don't have to make copies every week, right? Because I don't do it that way. Consider yourself lucky to even have this job. United 723. Midwest Center. Resume normal speed. Descend and maintain flight level 280. Rookie. The pilots aren't dogs. Loosen up. Southwest 116, turn left heading 280. Vector for traffic, expect direct Mason City... traffic at your two o'clock, fifteen miles. Beautiful! Look at that separation. Okay, let's hear it for the rookie! Get your own coffee from now on. Tristate 723 maintain maximum forward... Southwest 116, contact Midwest Center... I'll be back in a minute. Get that scope running. Southwest 116, contact Midwest Center 123.4. Watch your sequencing and separation, man... - or you'll get yourself cornered. - Where? Right there, left of Tristate. You got two planes coming into each other in about three minutes. - Tristate. - Don't panic. Just talk to him and put him somewhere. Tristate 723, this is Midwest Center. Turn left heading 210, reduce speed to 250 knot. There you go. Continental 301, traffic ten o'clock, one mile northbound. - How you doin'? - Pretty good. Pan Atlantic 234... traffic eleven o'clock, two zero miles east... What the hell is this? I'm goin' down. What do you got? Come on. We got a blackout! - Let's go - Got nothing! Switch to backup! - Switching. - Come on. Back up is down. Start the backup radios. Radio is down. What the hell is goin' on? We've got a blackout. Find a phone. That's right. Saint Louis - can't you see him? - No. No, not here. Yes! - Radio change. - What do I do? Keep the picture in your head. Call in the positions... - to International. - Keep it in my head? - I got ten planes! - Just get another phone. I got two of 'em about to crash... - in two minutes! - And I've got four. I'm sorry, man, I can't help you right now. Just get to a phone... any phone. Have Chicago tower take over your airspace. - Williams' got the number. - Code five. Tell 'em we've got no contact. What? What's the number for the Chicago air tower? - 5552320. Are you still there? - You gotta find him... - because he's in heavy traffic. - Who's that? - backup. - facilities... radar on... Do you see it? Heavy traffic. - He's at 22,000. At about... - I need a phone. - a hundred and twenty miles east. - Where is there another phone? Try downstairs. Last altitude known, flight level 223. - twenty-six fourteen miles - Please! I need the phone! - and that's to... - I got two and a half minutes! - to 2803. - Sorry. Excuse me! I need a phone! - Emergency, I need a phone! - Join the club. I got a disaster in two minutes! Upstairs, outside. Zero, should be pickin' 'em up right now. Where's he goin'? I need the phone. - I'm sorry, I got planes in the air. - Hey, what the hell? American 22 heavy, cancel take off clearance. All flights out of Chicago cancelled. Pick up the traffic from Center. Ground stop everything. - International. - This is Tim Conners. Midwest Center I got a Tristate 723 squawk 7127 climbing Eastbound... Westbound three miles east of the airport. I got a Pan Atlantic 234 squawk 1017... eastbound climbing fifteen for twenty-five in its path. It's been a good minute and a half. I just hope... - they can see each other. - I'm tryin' to find 'em. - What frequency are they on? - 118.55 11855. Pan Atlantic 234... this is Chicago International, do you read? Pan Atlantic 234... Not on that frequency. They're talkin' to somebody... - I just don't know who. - Can't you just see it? I don't see it. It's gotta be there. I see a vector on the west. Let me talk to somebody else. American, you've traffic on your right... could be Tristate 723. You've visual? Well, they're flyin' straight into traffic. Do you have... a frequency for 'em? Got it. Tristate 723, this is Chicago International... taking over your airspace. You've traffic at your altitude. A jet eastbound at twenty thousand. Descend immediately. Descend immediately. Descend! Please. Pan Atlantic don't descend with 'em. Come on. Come on. Yes! We got 'em. We got 'em separated. You're okay. Midwest Center. Thank you. - Thank you, God. - We all done now? Yes. Attention all aircraft, ground stop still in effect... delays to metered airports are expected. We're back! We are back on line! - Get right on it. - Hey, Buzz Alright! Alright, let's get back up to speed. Come on. Thank you very much. And you can keep it. I was robbed. It should have fallen. - Should have fallen. - Hey, Lafia, since when you buyin'? I'm not, these are for me, get your own. - Come on. - Too good to be true. - Cheers. - Thank you. - Hey, to us. - This is to us. I gotta take this. Hey, if it's Tristate... - tell 'em to keep circlin'. - Tell 'em to keep circlin'. Rookie, you okay? Yeah. I'm alright. There're tense moments at the Midwest Center... - Air Traffic Control... - We're on the news! earlier this morning when a power outage caused a blackout. All radar and communications were down for almost five minutes. No accidents or near midair collisions were reported. Frank Wyatt, facility manager of Midwest Center responded. It was tense, there's no question about that... - but this is the point that... - There he is. - I wish to emphasize is that... - Hey, Frankie. Come on... - even though we experienced... - come on, tell 'em Frankie... - a major power outage at a... - tell it like it is! very important air traffic control facility, the system worked. The system worked because we've well-designed contingency plans... and we've well-trained, highly skilled professional... - air traffic controllers. - And that would be us. - The system failures rarely occur. - Yeah, Dan. - Gentlemen! - Yes? And if they do, they present no problem to the flying public. - We continue to do our job, - Does Kennedy know about... - to minimize delays - the blackout at the facility today? - to ensure the smooth flow of... - Well... - air traffic control... - yes, it is urgent, actually. - and of course the safety... - I need to speak to him before... - Today's particular... - his press conference. - system failure did cause... - Can you make that happen? - delays at Chicago International... - Thank you. however, and this is a point I want to emphasize... at no time was public safety compromised. This was essentially a non-event. What the hell is he talkin' about? It was chaos! They had planes flying with no communication... or radar for four minutes! - Do they know what caused it? - No. But I'm gonna find out. Kim, bring Henry Drake back in. They're gonna nail him for 1025... in two hours and I wanna talk to him again first. Paul, get me a printout of every blackout reported at Midwest. In fact, every center and Tracon... - in the country. - Call Wyatt. - No. - He's the facility manager. I know who he is, Kim. Go outside the agency. Get it from NASA. The aviation reporting systems control base. I wanna know about any and all blackouts from now on. What the hell happened out there? It could be a commercial power failure. Could be a switching mechanism. I may need to swap a circuit breaker. - I don't know yet. - I cannot manage a system... that I've to piecemeal together with paper clips and chewing gum. We'll fix the problem. And then what? - Sir? - We're busy. I think you should look at this right away. According to F.A.A. facility manager Wyatt, there was no correlation... between today's blackout and the Global 1025 midair collision... three weeks ago which claimed... - one hundred eighty-five lives. - Of course not. F.A.A, officials did not disclose the cause of today's blackout. National Transportation Board director, Dr William Kennedy... has scheduled a press conference to address recent findings... in the crash of Global 1025. Though officials insist that the cause of the crash... is still under investigation, there are unconfirmed reports... that the N.T.S.B. will find that controller error... was ultimately responsible for the midair disaster. Come on, what do I've to do? They're there, the N.T.S.B. They saw the blackout! - The release of the transcript... - Henry... - from the flight's data recorder... - you're scaring the kids. confirmed what investigators have suspected since the crash. Federal officials today indicated that data from the flight recorder... clearly established that... Henry Drake the Midwest Center... - air traffic controller... - I didn't cause the crash of 1025. - failed to communicate... - I didn't cause... No - the correct flight position... - I can't explain it. - and altitude during the final... - Hello? Karen, this is Harold. - Where's Henry? - Why? If you hear from him at all, let me know. We got a problem. A big problem. What? Always. Question authority. You see this, they lie and they lie... and then they lie to cover the lies. Girls, can you go play in the other room for a minute? critic of the system, claiming that... the antiquated equipment at the center failed him. - Henry. - There was... a memorial service today in the small town... - of Norfolk, California. - What were you doing... - in the basement? - Perhaps the town... most devastated by the crash of 1025. Henry... were you in the basement this afternoon before the blackout? Yeah, I was in the basement before the power went out. Why? I was lookin' for somethin'. Behind the power supply unit? I was looking for something in the room... then somebody came in and I hid behind the power supply unit... and then the power went out, but I didn't touch anything. Why did you hide behind the power supply unit? Because I know how people are, Karen. - Why are you attacking me? - Henry, they've got... a security camera in the power supply room. You're on the tape! So, they've got me on tape. I work there, don't I? Girls. - Hello. - Hello. Henry... that was Harold on the phone. They're looking for you. That's management. They're... - trying to intimidate you 'cause - Look, Henry, no, that's... - they know that we're friends... - not what it is. Henry... - and they... - just be quietl Wait a minute. They couldn't possibly think that this is intentional? They think that I caused the blackout? My God! They called the F.B.I. God. The F.B.I., they called the F.B.I. for me. I've gotta go. - My God! - Just call them and you explain... - to them or you explain it to me. - I can't explain! I can't explain! I've done that. Nobody is gonna help me now. Nobody! - Unbelievable. - What? Blackouts in the national database. And this is just for this year. Look at the times on some of these, a minute and a half, three minutes... - four minutes? - Are you ready for this? I just spoke with Midwest. They think that Henry Drake is responsible for the blackout today. What? How? They caught him on security tape... - near the power supply. - What the hell... - was he doing? - I don't know. - Did anybody ask him? - They can't. He's gone. I need more time. I'm not cancelling this press conference, John. What is it you expect to find? Last year there're over 1,500 outages across the country. I just experienced one today. Now, how is it that this facility... is so damn sure that one little three second glitch didn't happen? I've got two unsatisfactory condition reports... that no one seems to be able to find. I've got a lab technician who used to work at that facility... who's telling me that he's seen a data block disappear from a scope. He's seen it happen. Now why are we... rushing to blame a hundred and eighty-five deaths on one guy... - when we're not sure? - You're not sure. Yes, and I'm the lead investigator of this case, sir. Let me tell you something, John. I speak to the American public, I speak to the U.S. Congress... and today I spoke to the President of the United States. Now, if you expect me to publicly indict... the air traffic control system based on a couple of... missing documents and one ex-lab technician, you're very wrong. We had a deal, John. I'd allow you to stay on this case if you could... handie it professionally, emotionally. If you can't then I'll take you off. Do you understand me? Yes, sir. With me tonight is Frank Wyatt... the facility manager at Midwest Center. From the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Jim Travis... and Stephen Royer from the F.A.A. Now, our efforts have focussed on communication... between the air traffic controller at Midwest Center... and the Global pilot. Voice communication, black box data have confirmed that... serious errors in judgement were committed by... the air traffic controller who was in contact with Global 1025... and the P.D.O. cargo jet. - I don't know. - As to any findings that... the air traffic control system itself was... compromised or deficient in any way,... the N.T.S.B. has been unable to make that determination. Mr. Wyatt and Mr. Royer will answer questions... - regarding that. - Mr. Wyatt, were there other... power outages at the facility that may have been caused by Henry Drake? At this time, we've no idea. - What did they make? - Come on. - Mr. Travis from the F.B.I... - Four... - will now make a statement. - five, six... As of 5.00pm tonight, the F.B.I. has launched a nationwide... search for Henry Drake. Fifty-seven, fifty-eight... He's wanted for questioning in regards to the crash of Global 1025 as well as the blackout which occurred today... at the Midwest Facility. We're notifying all local law enforcement agencies... to assist us in his apprehension. Do you see this as an act of revenge by Henry Drake? That's certainly possible, though we can't comment on... his motives until we question him. Is there any speculation that the crash of 1025... was not an accident, but somehow a deliberate act? We can't speculate right now but we're certainly looking into that possibility. Look at this. This is a tape of the traffic we plugged into yesterday. The scope overheated for four hours. Now, keep your eye on this. That is a Tristate jet 624 and now it's at ten thousand feet. It disappeared. Now watch. It's not there... It's not there... There it is. Now it's at 15,000 feet. That's exactly what Drake said happened to his scope. Did we check the fan on Drake's scope? It functioned. You don't think this guy is guilty? I mean, come on! Look at the guy! Total loser. Ticking time bomb. - He's guilty. - He's like that guy you wanted... to beat up in high school, right? Now he's like in the spotlight. This is his fifteen minutes of fame. Right, like killing a bunch of people wasn't enough. Watch this! You know, I wanna hear from callers. Where do you think Henry Drake is right now? Did anybody check his Mom's house? I need your help. I told you yesterday, man, I quit that place. Lot of pressure around there lately? Yeah, a little bit. What else? Look, I'm paying someone by the hour to ask those questions. Listen, there's a guy out there that everyone thinks may have killed... a hundred and eighty-five people. And maybe he did. But if he didn't, do you want that on your conscience? Gimme a break, man. As the intensive manhunt for Henry Drake increases... more questions arise. The unthinkable. Could Henry Drake have deliberately caused the crash of 1025? Who is Henry Drake? Kicked off the student council at Dunbar High School... fellow students recall the straight-A nerd as hotheaded and argumentative. Fellow chess club member, Tom Brown says he was stickler for details... and an avid science fiction... I bet ya didn't think you'd be back down here so quick? When I worked down here, we're afraid to take... this stuff apart, the connections were so old. That's a relic? We're the number one buyer of vacuum tubes in the world. We're the only buyer of vacuum tubes in the world. I can never figure out why they haven't tried to update the system. They tried. They gave an outside company... a contract to redesign the software. Three billion dollars later... they still hadn't come up with anything better. - They just scrapped the project. - They come up with nothing? Zip. Three billion dollars. Look at this. What? See this part right here? There's soot... on the connections from the wires... - to the fan. - These are all old parts, right? Yeah, except for this right here. The fan. It's too clean. This is a new part. How do we find out when it was replaced? Every part has a serial number. Every serial number's gotta be... logged in the maintenance log book. Do you mind if I hang onto this for a while? - No, not at all. - Thanks. I know I'm just one of many overdressed strangers... asking you where Mr. Drake is right now, correct? And if you don't know where he is or if you're lying about it, then... I'll be honest with you, there's nothing I can do about it. I'm not a cop or the F.B.I. or the F.A.A. All I wanna know is what happened to 1025. So... if and when you do speak to Mir. Drake... will you please tell him that I am his only hope? It sounds corny, but he'll know what it means. Ms. Garfield? This is a maintenance log from the Midwest Center. Would you do an analysis on it as soon as you can? An analysis? What are you... - looking for? - I don't know. Anything... - out of the ordinary. - John, it was human error. - You know it. - Just do it. Thank you. - John. The Midwest Center... - Yeah? has no record of this. And we don't know when it was installed? How about when it was shipped from the manufacturer? They don't know. Are you telling me that no one at Midwest Center... has any record of this part at all? That doesn't sound like human error to me. No. Yeah, get me Frank Wyatt, please. I don't wanna have the discussion anymore. I'm sick and tired of it. I know what you're gonna say anyway. Alls I'm saying is you can't say the '94 Bulls... could beat the '83 Celtics or the '88 Lakers. - It was a different game back then. - So what? That's not my fault! I'm not saying it's your fault. Why are you taking it so personally? Yeah? Who is it? Yeah, hang on. Karen, it's for you. It's "some guy." He's goin' after that pension, baby, you know it! - You guys give me a headache. - Careful. - Hello? - Karen, it's me, Henry. - Where are you? - I'm just gonna ask you... to do one thing, okay? Karen? Would you just do this one thing for me? Do not go to work at the facility on Wednesday. - And don't fly. - What are you saying? Just do what I'm telling you to do. Do not fly or go to work at the facility on Wednesday. Listen, they wanna help you. Tag that and get a copy to Paul Roth. - As soon as ya can. Thanks. - Will do. I think Henry's gonna do something. - What? - I don't know what. But he called me and told me not to go... near the facility or fly on Wednesday. This Wednesday? Two days from now. Did he say why? No. That's the day before Thanksgiving. Excuse me. He told her not to fly or go to the facility. Now, I'd take that as a serious threat. You don't know Henry Drake like I do. He's all talk. You're the one that accused him of shutting down the system. He doesn't work here anymore. As long as he's out there and not in here... - he's not a threat. - Is there any way that he could... - get in here? - How? The facility's... guarded twenty-four hours a day. We've changed the security codes. How can he get in? We're meeting with the F.B.I. We're taking this seriously. You handle the N.T.S.B. investigation, John. We'll worry about Henry Drake. - Okay. - Alright, let's get started. There's nothing unusual about any of the entries. Except for two. This entry was made three months ago, August 8th. "Scope serviced, check data display, results pass." Now, everything looks normal to the naked eye. Writing's the same, ink's the same. The scope I.D. number is 5321. But, under infrared, the entry looks like this. Everything still looks the same except for the scope I.D. number. 5321 is now 58273. The three's been altered to look like an eight... the one to a seven, and somebody's added a three. 5321. That was Drake's scope. - And the other entry? - Same complaint... same service, also passed. Keep that log secure. John. You're right. I knew you'd find it. Thanks, Ms. Garfield. I'm not workin' traffic tomorrow if you're thinkin' of bustin' me. A draft. Want another one? - I'm good, thanks. - Just one. What do you wanna talk about now? Is there a question you've not asked me? Yeah. Who altered the two entries in the maintenance log book? Can't help you on that one. I think you can. And I'm not gonna leave till you do. Thanks. You listen to me. I've cooperated with you. I've answered your questions. You don't disrespect me by cornin' in here... and accusin' me of something I know nothing about. Were they changed before or after the crash? I don't know what the hell you're talkin' about. You guys. You guys think they're just blips on a screen, don't you? You don't know what I think. There is nothing you or I could ever do to bring those people back. Were they changed before or after the crash? How would I know anything about entries in the program log? 'Cause you're the supervisor. Only you and the lab technician have access to it. Then you should talk to the lab technician. I just did. I already know you did it. I just don't know why. I got thirty years on this job. I tell somebody below me to do something, they do it. Somebody above me tells me to do something, I do it. That's the way it works, man. How come you don't understand that? Who told you to change the log? Frank Wyatt please. It's John Dantley calling. Yes, I'd. Would you please tell him to meet me... tomorrow afternoon at the crash site? It's urgent. Thank you. Okay. Great. The whole system's fried. Repeater scope, console, radios, everything. I've never seen anything like it. - Thanks, George. - Yeah. - How do you fry an entire system? - HERF. - Beg your pardon? - High energy radio frequency. They used something like it in the Gulf War. It'd shut down communications, radar, it fries everything. - Name? - Jim Hale. ID? Maintenance from International? Yes, sir. Do you know where to park? - Sure do. - Alright, then. Jim Hale from International. Okay. We gotcha here. If you could just sign in for me... - please. - Yes, ma'am. How's Jenny? Jenny Glass? She's fine. Yeah, she works weekends now. - Well, you tell her I said hi. - I sure will. You know the code, right? No actually. You know, they had changed it... after the last time I was here, I think. - Do you mind? - Sure, no problem. Thank you so much. - Tell Jenny I say hi. - I will. - Meadows, I'm back. - So, what is it... you wanted me to see, John? You ever been to a crash site before? No. Quite a smell, isn't it? Each crash site has a very unique smell. Can't get rid of it. Gets on you. Your clothes, your shoes. I've never gotten used to it. The 757 didn't explode on impact. The tail section tore off from the sheer force of the fall. But it didn't explode. It just spiralled down... - My God. - for two minutes. Everyone was still strapped in and alive till it hit the ground. For two minutes. Can you imagine what those two minutes must've been like... for those passengers? No. No, I can't, John. See this little fan? It's part of a scope. It has one function only to cool the unit. You see, what happened the night of the crash, a little wire... connected to the fan arced. The fan stopped working. And that caused the character generator to overheat. So the scope blacked out. When the scope blacked out, the data block vanished... which caused the controller to give the wrong information to the pilot... which caused the two planes to fly into each other... and kill a hundred and eighty-five people... including a woman I knew and loved. Because of this little part, you recognize it? It's from Henry Drake's scope. It was replaced the night of the crash. Of course it should've been replaced months ago when Drake said... "Hey, there's something wrong with my scope," but... nobody's gonna listen to a guy like that. But after the crash... somebody listened and replaced this part. And destroyed the unsatisfactory reports he filed. And nothing was said to the N.T.S.B. Nothing was said when an innocent man was blamed. Nothing was said when a hundred and eighty-five people were killed! Wait a minute. Do you think that if I knew that this would happen... that I'd allow it to happen? But you did allow it to happen. I did not know, John. - You don't understand. - Well, tell me. - Tell me what I don't understand. - Every day, every single day... I'm responsible for keeping thousands of planes in the sky. That's my job. People spend longer 'n twenty minutes... on the tarmac in Chicago, John, I hear about it. But I only have so much control of airspace. So many controllers, so many scopes so many technicians and equipment that breaks down. I've to keep the planes running on time... with a system that I'm just trying to keep afloat. Now, I know that that's not right. We make do with what we have. But if it's not right, then why do you protect it? Because it's what we do. Frank... Yeah, Bill Kennedy, please. It's John Dantley calling. Yeah, I'll hold. I don't care what time it is. Do it. - Just do it. - Right over there... I want agents spread out in a two mile radius of the facility. Go! - Dantley. - Go on inside. - They're expecting you. - Thanks. I say we do what he says. We're running out of time, gentlemen. What did the Department of Transportation say? I spoke to the Secretary an hour ago. It's our call. We shut the Midwest Center down, that means we ground the planes... the day before Thanksgiving. - We're gonna ground the planes? - Chaos. We already have it. We got two hour delays. People are cancelling flights. Phone lines are overloaded. - Airports are a mess. - Ground the planes. Think of our priorities here. I understand your instinct to be cautious. It's mine, too. But the threat is not specific enough. How much more specific can he be? He said "ground the planes in an hour or I'll shut this system down." How? He can't get inside the building. I couldn't get inside the building. He can't do it outside the building. We got built-in E.M.I. shielding that blocks frequencies. What, Frank, up to ten gigahertz? Radar's off-site and heavily guarded. So, you'd put your wife on a plane right now? That's not the issue. - That is the issue. - Unless Henry Drake... is some kind of a genius, I cannot believe this man... can shut this system down. I cannot, in good conscience... stop fifty million people from travelling today. I can't do it. He is a genius, Royer. Ground the planes. Hello? John, I think you better take this. - Hello? - I'm shuttin' it down. You've five minutes. He's here. We've got five minutes. Excuse me. Watch it, coming through! Check the microwave links upstairs on the roof. Got it. Henry. Don't come any closer. Stay right there. So, is anybody listening to me now? Yeah, we're listening. - We're all listening. - Haven't shut it down though have they? - What are you doing? - I'm gonna shut it down myself. You see this? I can fry this whole system. You'd never get it back up. They'd have to ground the planes for a week. And, what about the ones up there right now? What happens to them? I can't think about them. Well, think about it. Henry, you want more people to die? How many more innocent people have to die? Five hundred? A thousand? - Two thousand. - No. Don't come any closer! Stay right where you are. Well... what you're gonna kill yourself and me? For what? You're innocent. I proved it. You're lying. There was a flaw in the system. We found it. And I promise you, I'll do everything within my power... - to fix it. - It can't be fixed! Maybe not, but I can at least try. And I need your help. Henry, don't let... those hundred and eighty-five people die in vain. Make their lives count for something. - I didn't... - Make their families think that... that something... - decent can come out of all this. - I... - I didn't... - Don't take that away from them... or me. I didn't kill those people. I didn't kill those people. I know. I just... I didn't kill them. I didn't kill them. I didn't kill those people... I know.
