(dramatic music) (crowd cheers) Come on! (crowd cheers) Well, I will tell you, Cassandra, it is great to see Chen back on American soil after a three year hiatus playing for Paris Saint-Germain. Over in Europe. You're so right, Nick. But it's really hard not to notice that there is a real sharpness to Chen's play that we are just not used to seeing from her. [Nick] I absolutely agree with that. [Cassandra] Oh, there she goes. [Nick] There she goes. [Cassandra] Oh, down the line, she is setting up for another attack. (crowd cheers) (whistle blows) Offside. (crowd groans) That was not offside! That was a goal. It was offside. Hey, hey, you've already got a yellow card. She's wrong! (crowd jeers) Hey, ref, you better check your cell. You've been making wrong calls all game. What is she doing? (crowd boos) No, no, no, no. Look at Coach's reaction to that. And this is exactly what we've been seeing from her over the last while, isn't it? Enough! (crowd grumbles) (whistle blows) [Nick] And it is all over. Portland 2, Chicago 1. [Cassandra] That was a tough loss for the home team. Coach Avila does not look happy. She does not. And why would she be? That's the third game Chen's been ejected from this season. Sorry, Em, that was a bad call. When I'm in the zone, all I think about is a goal. I know. That's what makes you so good, but also gets you in trouble. How do you stay so level-headed? Journaling. Hey, come out with us for a change. Nah, thanks though. Okay. Chen. You. My office. (tense music) When did you start doing that? It's supposed to be calming. Right now, I could use some calm. Do you know why we signed you? 'Cause I'm the top scorer of the league. That, and I thought you could mentor the younger players, impart some knowledge beyond your skills. But your most notable moment this season was pouring your sports drink on a ref. That was a bad call, and you know it. Just like today. I wasn't offside! That was a goal. Maybe. But if you already got a yellow card, you have to know you can't argue with the ref! - But I- - But you did! And got ejected. So we played one man down, and lost because of it. If you were anyone else, I'd have cut you sooner. So, what? I'm being reprimanded because of some lousy ref? No, you're not getting reprimanded. You're getting suspended. (Emily laughs) It's not a joke. I've turned in the paperwork. You're suspended indefinitely, for conduct detrimental to the team. But I scored half the goals this season. You're an amazing player. You always have been. You are a great teammate, but lately you've become a liability. I can do better. Look, I can't begin to understand how it's been since losing Caroline, which is why I let it go as far as it did. But I can't allow this kind of behavior. (melancholic music) Please, Coach. (melancholic music) Thank you for an amazing season. But get some rest, Chen. What's she thinking? She can't do that. I'll start a petition. And say what? That you're Emily freaking Chen. Gold medalist. You've won the World Cup three times. Only two people have scored more goals than you in the history of American soccer. And yet I still got suspended. I'm sure you can fix this. And I'm sure Coach will come around. I'm glad you're sure, 'cause I'm not. (mellow music) You know I got you. (mellow music) [Nick] And the Chicago Premier have announced that their leading scorer, Emily Chen, has been suspended indefinitely. (Emily grunts) (melancholic music) (cell phone rings) Hey, B, what's up? Oh, nothing. Ava and I were just watching some sports highlights. Hi, Cucu. Hi, Ava. I hope you didn't watch mine. We did. Which is why I was thinking- We were thinking. Sorry, we. We were thinking this would be the perfect time for you to come visit us. Be surrounded by people who love you. Now is not a good time. I gotta train. Train here. Please, Cucu. You can come watch one of my games. We haven't seen you in like, forever. Like pre-folklore era, ever. Post-reputation for sure. But we measure time by Taylor albums. Taylor who? I'm gonna forget you just said that. Well, we've decided you're coming. So... (text message dings) You're probably gonna wanna check that. It's economy class because I'm a social worker. But I trust you'll be comfortable. Come on, Em. You need us. (lighthearted music) Fine. Yes! I'll see you soon. (lighthearted music) (Emily chuckles) Hey, guys! (all laughing) (lighthearted music continues) Mm. Ava, Brandon. Hey! Can I start you off with something to drink? Flat white with oat, please. I'm sorry. Our espresso machine is broken, and the oats just didn't wanna be milked. Just a coffee. Black. Mhm. Thank you. Another oat milker. (Ian chuckles) It's what I've been telling you, Sandra. You may not agree with it, but if you don't start carrying oat milk products, it's gonna cost you. And besides the upcharge, it's gonna pay for itself. But why would anybody pay more for watered down oats? It just makes no sense. It doesn't have to make sense. People want what people want, and you want me to help your business make you more money. So... Alt milk. We'll put it in the report. Okay. I'll put it in the report. I'm so glad you're coming to my game tomorrow. Me too. I can't wait for you to meet my coach. Mhm! Ava, do you think you could go stake out the pie situation? Mhm. It's 10:00 AM. And we're getting it to go. I'm not an animal. Just forward thinking. [Ava] On it. (Brandon chuckles) I'm glad you're here, but I wish it didn't take something as catastrophic as you being suspended to come to town. Look, I know you and Ava watch games over video chat, but that's no substitute for you not being here. You know, with Caroline gone, you're the closest thing she has to a mom. Ava misses you, you know? No pressure. That's not fair. You're right. I'll do better. (lighthearted music) Thanks. (lighthearted music) Why do you insist on wearing all that? Because, I've trained with you before. (Emily chuckles) (Brandon shouts) (Emily chuckles) (Emily chuckles) (Brandon grunts) Did you find out what's going on with Ava? That kid's a closed book. She'll come around. (lighthearted music) You know, I would say it's not fair that you got all the athletic talent in the family but... I did get all the good looks, so. Mhm. (Brandon grunts) Oh! (Emily laughs) (lighthearted music) (door creaks) (dog barks) Cucu, it's so early. (Emily chuckles) I love that photo of us. Your mom scored three goals in that game. You know what her post-game demand was? Donuts. (Emily laughs) You, me, your mom... Donuts. I miss her so much. (somber music) (Emily sighs) Me too. (Ava clears throat) But seriously, are you gonna eat the donuts? 'Cause I thought you were on training mode. Mm... I'll eat carbs for you. Ooh. Mhm. (lighthearted music) (men chattering) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Ah, come on! [Man] There you go. (men chattering) [Man] Nice! [Man 2] Yeah, yeah, there, there! Hey, hey, hey. [Man] Whoa, whoa, whoa. All right, volleyball. Hey. A little help. Hey. Oh. You wanna play, don't you? That obvious? Yeah. I mean, we need, you know, another player. We'll be huffling. Well, nobody really stretches that long. (Emily chuckles) Not true. Yeah? Yogis, gymnasts. (Ian chuckles) People who have bad backs. And which one are you? Okay, fine. Yeah? Hey, I got you guys a player. Go get warmed up. All right. Let's see what you got. (tense upbeat music) All right, that's enough showin' off. (Emily yells) (Ian shouts) (Ian groans) Yes! Emily Chen is back! (Ian groans) My ankle, man. I'm so sorry. It was a pickup game, all right? It's supposed to be fun. I think you're gonna have to get this checked out. My brother lives down the street, I can drive you. No, you have done enough. (melancholic music) You see this all the time. - Who's there? - Wait. Hey, look. (cell phone rings) Stop. I just... What? Hello? Brando speaking. Oh, no. That's terrible. Well, I would, but it's been years since I've played. Can you just hold for a sec? Ava's coach had some kind of emergency. They're gonna have to forfeit unless we can find someone to fill in. What? No, I've never coached before. You're a professional soccer player. You're like the perfect person. Please? We're one win away from the playoffs. They've never been this close before. (lighthearted music) Okay, yeah. Yes! Yeah, hey. My sister will do it. Yeah. She'd love to. Okay, thanks. Bye. (lighthearted music) (Sheila gasps) Is that your sister? - Hi, Em. - Oh, hey. (Sheila chuckles) Oh! Oh my gosh, you don't even know who I am, and here I am hugging you. I'm Sheila! But I also answer to "Mom" or "Hey You", or of course, "Team Parent". Thank you so much for stepping in like this. Of course. Anything for Ava. Okay, well, I'll let you get to it then. Pearl Thunder! Circle up! Okay. You. You're gonna give her your gloves, and you are gonna be a goalkeeper, and you are gonna be striker. Oh. - Um... - Interesting. Are you sure she knows what she's doing? Well, she's never coached a game in her life, so, no. We got it. [Emily] Ready? Bold choice! Over here! I'm open! I'm open! (people chattering) (lighthearted music) Oh... You. Whoa. Oh. How's your ankle? Oh, like you care. Believe it or not, I'm capable of empathy. I feel really terrible about it. Yeah? Yeah? My ankle is gonna be fine. It's a light sprain. It'll heal quickly. Good. Mhm. Did you come all the way here for an apology? (Ian chuckles) This? This is my team. And what is Alicia doing playing striker? She's good, isn't she? We're winning 5-1, and she scored four of those. You know what? Winning, it's not everything. Tell that to my trophy case. Aw, that is cute. You know what? Thank you for stepping in. I appreciate you covering. I've got it covered from here. By all means. What... (whimsical music) (whistle blows) (people cheering) Oh. You're welcome. (whimsical music) (girls cheering) [Girls] Up, up, up! Purple Thunder! Good job, girls. (people cheering) Did you see us out there? I scored four goals! I heard you were on fire, yeah! But you know what, girls? Winning isn't everything. It certainly isn't the most important thing. What's the most important thing is having fun, right? [Girls] We did! Because they won. Yeah. Well, win or lose, I'm proud of you. I hate to be the one to bring up the elephant in the room, but with you on crutches, you can't possibly train the girls this week. So we've all been talking, and we think Emily should stay on. At least through this next game. Let's get to the quarter finals! [Girls] Yes! I don't think it's a good idea, Sheila. Well you thought a good idea was playing your best striker in goal. (Ian laughs) Please? Please? (tense whimsical music) All right. You know what? Let's do this thing, huh? (girls cheering) (lighthearted music) I gotta go finish some homework. What you working on? Oh. Mm... I just have to read something from language arts. (mysterious music) As the kids would say these days, that was sus. Agreed. But I wouldn't worry about it. She's a great kid. Yeah, you're probably right. Hey, listen. Thanks for everything. It means a lot there, helping out with Ava's team. We haven't been as close as we used to be lately. Yeah? Well, she's at that age. I'm sure there's stuff she'd rather talk to Caroline about. You don't think she wants to talk to you about her first crush? Well, I don't see why she wouldn't. I'm a cool dad. A cool dad would never use the phrase "cool dad". Only a cool dad will use the phrase "cool dad". You're sad. You know, you're the opposite of happy. Mhm. - Let me just- - Mm-mm! Finish up here, and give you a chance to go out and explore. You know, live your best life. Party. Okay. I can take a hint. [Maya] So, how are things going in Southern Pines? Training's great. I mean, there's not much to do here, so that's a plus. (Maya chuckles) Did I tell you I started coaching for Ava's team? That's awesome. Good for you. Hey, what's that behind you? Twelfth Night? Maybe you could try your hand at acting. Sorry to disappoint, but I think I've just missed the cutoff. Besides, the only time that I've ever been on stage is when I was in fourth grade in this Can-Can musical. Please tell me you have video evidence of that. Not a chance. [Maya] Well, now that we've ruled out the theater, where are you thinking? Dunno. Beg coach for another chance? Give up any remaining shred of dignity or self-preservation? I was more thinking, what are you thinking of doing tonight? Oh. Ooh, question answered. Follow them. I have to get up early. For what exactly? Uh, okay, okay. I'm going. (upbeat dance music) Oh, excuse me. How does this work? Oh, no solo players. Need to join a team. Oh. Great. Whoa! Oh my God, I'm so sorry. Let me help you. Oh. (Ian chuckles) It's you. There you are! Thought you fell in the toilet or something. Uh, almost. Hi, I'm Noor. And you are? Not a hugger. Uh, this is Emily. Emily is the reason why I'm on crutches and soaked in beer. Oh. I can't tell if that's a good or bad "ah". (Ian chuckles) You know what, I've known her since kindergarten, and I can never tell either. Oh, I almost forgot why I come over in the first place. Liz messaged to say she can't make it. Well, we needed four to play. (whimsical music) (Noor gasps) What? It was really nice to meet you. I have to go home. Again, I'm really sorry. You know, we need a team of four to play. Would you like to play trivia? You'd be doing us a favor. Yeah? Yeah. I'd love to. (Noor chuckles) (lighthearted music) (Emily chuckles) So, what brings you to Southern Pines? Seems like a random stop for a professional athlete like yourself. - Family. - Aw. Now that I have a little bit more time on my hands than usual. How do you guys know each other? Oh, Ian challenged me and Dion to a race the first day of kindergarten, and we have been friends ever since. I thought you don't care about winning. Oh, he's all about the competition. Every jog-a-thon, he out laps the rest of us by miles, practically refusing to stop. They would be taking in the cones, and he'd still be running. Interesting. It was for charity. Lies! (Dion laughs) You lived for it! And he always won too. He's one of those annoyingly perfect humans that's just good at everything they try. Yeah? All right, enough from you. (lighthearted music) Who was the only woman to be officially drafted by the NBA? Oh, I feel like I should know this. Lucia Harris? Oh. [Dion] Nice. What team was she drafted by? - Uh... - You know it. The New Orleans Jazz. (all chattering) - Okay! - Go, go! (Dion laughs) Nice, good job. (wondrous music) All right, this is the last question of the night. And the category is... Music of the 90s! (crowd murmurs) We totally got this. I strongly agree. They used to call Ian, "The Human Jukebox". Nice. And I'm freakishly good at Name That Tune. So I say, we bet it all. Mm, mhm. No, that's too risky. We're already up by five. Why would we do that? Exactly. The second team won't be able to take the lead if we put it all in. Go big or go home. Five, five, five, five. Okay. In Meat Loaf's 1993 power ballad, "I'd Do Anything for Love (But I Won't Do That)", what are the seven things he won't do for love? Never lie to her. Never forget how she feels tonight. Never forgive himself if he doesn't go all the way, do it better- Than he does it with her! [Ian] Nice. Stop dreaming of her every night of his life. See that it's time to move on. (Emily chuckles) That's six. Okay. Come on. Come on, you got this. Oh, okay, I got it. [Ian] You know the 7th? Perfect. She's got it. Thank you. [Dion] Okay, perfect. Oh, looks like we've got two teams with correct answers. So just give us a second to tally here. Okay, so, team Nom-Nom-Nom was in fourth place, but you bet 20 points, so that jumps you up to the lead. (people jeering) Now, let's take a look and see- Sorry, guys. What team Just For Kicks wagered, it's... 5 points. Team Nom-Nom-Nom! (people cheering) Here you go. You win some, you lose some. Hey, here's our nom, nom, nom! [Noor] Okay! All right, these... These are why we play. They're amazing. The best wings in the world. I don't want consolation wings. I want victory wings. You should've won. Winning isn't the point. (Emily chuckles) Winning is always the point. Enjoy the wings. Thanks for the game. (lighthearted music) (lighthearted music continues) (whistle blows) Did you see they're doing Twelfth Night this year? Anyone trying out? A hard pass. You're the CEO of being dramatic. How are you not trying out? Um, because I'd rather have a furry little hamster run across my belly while I'm sleeping than get up in front of other people and recite some dead guy's lines. That was dramatic. See, you should definitely try out. I actually think it'd be fun. I might audition. Is that ridiculous? No, that's low key impressive. How can there not be a single offensive drill in this entire practice? This is your chance at the quarter-finals. Do you think that I won three World Cups by playing small? Female athletes have enough going against them. It is our job as coaches not to- Bingo. You're my assistant coach. So assist me. It's my team. Can we try it my way? If we do things your way, they're gonna be holding hands, skipping down the field. Oh, okay. That's a bit dramatic, don't you think? Speaking of drama. Sorry, ladies. We were just having a little disagreement, trying to air out our differences here. That's nothing. You should see how mad my mom gets when my dad eats all the ice cream. Let's do the numbers drill, yeah? (whistle blows) Okay, come on. So excited. Can you please try and get along with Coach? We get along fine. We all heard you out there. How much did you hear? Enough. So you heard how he thinks he knows more about soccer than I do. I played with Jill Ellis. Okay, I think I know more than he does with my long and storied career as a professional soccer player. Cucu, we all know you can be a little... How can I put this nicely? Super frickin' stubborn. (Emily chuckles) Me? Stubborn? Yes! And you know what my best teachers never do? Go on and on about how much better they are. Because their job is to teach, not to be right all the time. That was harsh. But you do have a point. I promise to try to be better. (Emily chuckles) Thank you. Now, can we get tacos? I'm starving. No, we're gonna go have Chinese food. Tacos! Because I am a team player. See, I can be a team player. (lighthearted music) Hey. Oh, hey. Thanks for coming. Oh, hey, no crutches. Yeah, turns out I'm a quick healer. Thanks, Sandra. I don't think she likes me. I ordered a flat white with oat the other day. She wasn't havin' it. Let me tell you a secret about Sandra. She's a little rough on the front end, but once you're in with her, you're like basically a town local. So she's like a town bouncer. Yeah, she's kind of like a town bouncer. (bell dings) Hang on. Oh, Miss Sandra. Can I get what we talked about the other day? (whimsical music) (Ian chuckles) Thanks. Mhm. Yeah. Were you just... Were you hiding? I wasn't hiding. You were hiding. Eh. Oh. How'd you get the oat milk hook up? Is this some kind of locals only, secret society kind of thing? And how do I become a member? I do a little consulting for the cafe, and I convinced Sandra that carrying an alternative milk product would be financially beneficial for her, so. Never pegged you for a money guy. Mm, yeah, I don't really like to think of it like that. I just, you know... I enjoy strengthening small businesses financially. It's just sort of doing my part to help my community. That's actually pretty admirable. Yeah? Mm. And I'm glad you see it that way. Speaking of business, it's come to my attention that a certain someone, Ava, would like for us to get along. Okay. I know that we have different coaching strategies, but at the end of the day, we want what's best for the players. Yeah, I couldn't agree more. So, what do you say we take a 13 year old's advice and compromise. Wow. I mean, when you put it like that, it hurts a little bit. But yes, we should present the united front. We cannot, absolutely cannot be seen arguing again. Well, a little disagreement is healthy, no? Unless I missed a memo that you're the town relationship expert. You have no idea about my past relationships. Sorry. It was just a joke. Listen... I think I know how we can both get what we want. (hopeful music) I tell you what. I will give you 10 minutes of defensive drills, if you give me lava field. Field is lava? Come on. (bell dings) We have a deal? Done. (Ian chuckles) All right, good. Sandra, we are ready to feast. Yes. You gotta taste these, they're amazing. Just an egg white spinach omelet for me. Training mode. Oh. Just a matter of time before I get back on the field. I love that confidence. It's essential for a champion. But also, you know... I tell every client it's essential to have a backup plan for any successful business. You know, that way you avoid disappointment. Okay. But this is my career, and not some diner. Life isn't about mitigating disaster. It's about going for what you want. Wow. Okay. While I appreciate your input, I know what's best for me. In that case... I don't wanna mess up your training diet. (whimsical music) That's right, girls. That's right. Why do you keep checking the stop watch? This drill teaches communication and teamwork skills. You know what else could teach them how to communicate? By passing the ball. (Ian chuckles) (whistle blows) That's 10, Coach. Okay, this is my whistle. This is the head coach whistle, and you agreed to this format. And you agreed to a 10 minute time limit. Besides, this exercise isn't even soccer adjacent. Yeah, well, who's got the whistle, huh? Head coach. All right, box drill, everybody! Grab a ball and hustle up. (whistle blows) Okay. (lighthearted music) I pray you, tell me if this be the lady of the house, for I never saw her. I would be loath to cast away my speech... (tense music) Sorry. I should've knocked. That was great, by the way. Shakespeare? Mhm, yeah. Twelfth Night. Well, your dad's pretty hungry. And you know how he gets when his sugar dips down real low. (Emily chuckles) - Hangry. - Exactly. I'll be right now. (whimsical music) So, how's training? You know, I mean, it's going pretty... We're not bickering in front of the players anymore, so that's good. Just, it was going good the way it was. Good? Wasn't your team like 0 and 10? Oh, that was last season. Oh, right. Well, what about the players? How do they feel? Oh, they love it. Of course, they do. Imagine being 13 and being trained by a professional athlete. You know, we would've lost our minds if Beckham would've shown up to one of our practices. Yeah, all right. Point made, point made. Problem is, she is so difficult. All she cares about is winning. Maybe she just needs you to teach her the value of teamwork. Okay. (Ian chuckles) If a life and professional sports couldn't teach her that, how can I? Oh, actually... A couple of years ago, I did a ropes course with a few of my employees. It was a great bonding exercise. I think you and Emily should try that. Yeah, ropes. Yeah. It's pretty easy too. A lot of fun. (lighthearted music) Hey. Oh, hey. (Emily chuckles) Nice outfit. Look at us. It's like we planned it. Meant to be. Yeah. So, I don't know where we're going yet. Can I guess? Yeah, you can guess. But you know, I'm gonna cap it at three tries, so. Deal. Minigolf. That's one. - Brewery. - Two. Can you tell me if I'm warm? No, you're ice cold. We're not going geocaching, are we? That's three. That's a weird guess, and you're done. Are people still reading those things? Oh. (Ian and Emily chuckling) [Ian] Funny. Hey, isn't that the place you put an offer on a few years ago? [Ian] Ah, it's the place I almost put an offer on a few years ago. Right, yeah. Kind of big for a consulting firm. Actually, I was gonna turn this into a sports training center. I was gonna keep the soccer field just as it is. Then I was gonna blow it out, put some other fields in, hot yoga room, climbing wall. Wow. Cool. - Yeah. - What happened? You know... Life got in the way. What? Is that it? That's all you're gonna give me? Okay, since you're asking, getting a divorce kinda put a wrench in things. I did. I did ask. So, what now? Did you give it any more thought? We're gonna be late. Come on. Uh, okay. So, how did you get into consulting? Oh, well, I helped my best friend Dion restore an old, rundown summer camp that we used to go to, and he now uses it for birthday parties and family reunions and business. It's successful. Sounds fun. Okay, listen. Listen, lady. I may not be a fancy soccer player who gets to travel around the world, but numbers are predictable, and I like helping people in my own community build their small businesses. Don't you think it's ironic that you help other businesses succeed and not your own? (Ian chuckles) Okay, all right. You know what? Let's get harnessed up. Come on. (Emily laughs) You're funny. Oh. You're not kidding. Nah-uh. Yeah, no, I don't do heights. Oh, I'm a jerk. I didn't even think to ask if you were afraid of heights or not. I'm not afraid. I was just kidding. Wait... Last one there gets to run an extra drill at practice! I'm confused. So you are afraid or you're not... Why is everything a competition with this one? I win! (lighthearted music) Howdy. - Hi. - Hi. Hi. We have an appointment, 1 o'clock. Under the name of Ian. - Ian. - Yeah. Yeah, I got you right here. Gosh, I wish my partner was into stuff like this. (man chuckles) We're not a couple. Oh, well, props to you for planning such an adventurous first date then. We're not. We work together. (Ian chuckles) Oh, well... 1 in 10 couples do meet in the workplace, so. (Ian laughs) All right, let's get you sized up here. - It's not funny. - It's funny. It's not funny. (lighthearted music) You know what? On second thought, maybe the advanced course was a bit ambitious. Oh, no. This is still the basic course. Basic. We do have a kids course though, if this is too much for you guys. You want to do the kids course? No, I'm not a kid. I can do this. I'm ready. (whimsical music) All right. (Ian grunts) Okay. You good? Yeah. [Ian] Let's do this thing. Yeah. Okay. Whenever you're ready. (tense music) Is everything okay? (Ian chuckles) Sorry. You got this. (tense music) Emily. Hey, are you all right? Do you want to go back? We'll turn around. No. I said I wanted to do this, and I'm gonna do it. I just need you to talk me through this. Okay. I can do that. Here's what I want you to do. I want you to look at me, and just follow the sound of my voice. I can't. Yes, you can. Come here. No, you don't understand. I've been like this my whole life. I'm afraid of heights. I know it's irrational, but I'm a rational person. I swear. It's just that I can't. [Ian] No, I unders- My body won't do it. Listen, I get it. It might be rational, but it's also scary. Yeah. But you don't have to be afraid, because you're not doing it alone. I'm right here with you. So just look at me. I just need you to take three small steps. All right? Come on, look at me. There you go. Right here. It's perfect. You ready? First step. One, yup. Oh my gosh. It's great. It's great. Yeah. Yeah. All right, two. You're so close. All right. Last one. I got you. I got you. Wait. (Emily squeals) (Ian and Emily laughing) You did it! You did it. Woo! You guys really are such a cute couple. We're not a couple! (lighthearted music) (upbeat music) All right, let's go! Here we go! (upbeat music) (people cheering) Yeah! (Emily laughs) Yes! You're our good luck charm! No luck necessary. They worked really hard. They are winners! Which is what we want to talk to you about. We think Emily should stay on. I agree. No, just hear me out, okay? If we win the semi-final, that means that we go to the final. Amazing! But you know what that means for the team parents? It means I have to reschedule six wine socials, three book club meetings, two Bunco games, and a PTA fundraiser. And I certainly don't wanna go through all that work if the girls aren't getting the training they need. Sheila, I think it's- Please, just one more thing! I think it's a great idea! I love it. - What? - Yeah. Yeah. - Really? - Why not? Why mess with a good thing, huh? (Sheila shrieks) Okay, then yes! I'd love to stay on! (Sheila and Emily screeching) - Congrats, Dad. - Yes! Yes! (lighthearted music) (upbeat music) (people chattering) Well, look at that. Ha! You saw that, didn't you? Yeah, your secret's safe with me. (Emily chuckles) Now, if you want to try some real dip, come here. Who brings a carved out bread bowl to a team party? There's probably a gross, store-bought dip inside. Mm! This is amazing, Ian. Did you put homemade tahini inside the hummus? I did, Sheila. Yes, I did. I need this recipe. I'll give it to you. [Sheila] Okay, deal. What were you saying? Nothing. Oh, nothing. You know, usually when people lash out like that, there was this unresolved want underneath. Okay, Brene Brown. (Ian chuckles) Who's Brene? Who is that? Who's he? What? I never learned my way around the kitchen because of all the traveling. I'm more of a takeout kind of gal. That's why homemade tahini leaves me a little jealous. Well, I could show you a few things around the kitchen if you want. I'll think about it. It's time! It's time! Ooh, it is time. All right, three-legged race. It's good for team building. Come on. - Your specialty. - Come on. Three, two, one! Go! Come on! Hurry up, hurry up. We gotta go! They're winning, they're winning! Hurry up, we're gonna... (people oohing) We can still do it, we can still win. Come on, come on, come on! God, you're so slow! What are we doing? We're gonna win! (people laughing) What are we doing? (girls cheering) We go this, come on! (girls cheering) And in some uplifting news, Emily Chen coaches a Washington youth soccer team to the semi-finals. Could this be a new Emily? Well, there's some less uplifting news as well. The Premier continue their losing streak. Seems they can't find a win without Chen carrying them. So, what's holding you back? I wanna audition. I do. But... What if I get the part? That's normally a good thing. Sure. But if I get the part, I won't be able to do OTP. And if I don't get in the extra training, I'll never get a college scholarship. And if I don't play in college, I'll never go pro like you and mom. That's a lot of ifs. I want you to know that no matter what, I'm always gonna be here to support you, soccer or not. And your mom, she's gonna be happy with whatever you decide to do. My two cents... Follow your heart. What does it tell you? I don't know. I love soccer. There's just so many other things I want to try. Follow your heart. (wistful music) Proud of you. All I did was write my name down on a piece of paper. I think it was a little bit more than that. (lighthearted music) (girls chattering) - Hi! - Whoa! Gosh. What's with all the physical affection? I mean, I'm not complaining, I'm here for it. Seriously, thank you so much for coming. I can't wait to see their reactions. Here they come, Here they come. You're Maya Fayad. Hi. Hello. This is literally like my biggest dream come true. (Maya chuckles) This is great. Hey. Hi, Emily. Who's your friend? I wanted it to be a surprise. I hope it's okay. Yeah, no, of course. A friend of Emily's is a friend of the team. Isn't that right, ladies? [Girls] Yes! Awesome! Well, who wants to learn some new tricks? [Girls] Me! Let's go that way. (lighthearted music) Come on, come on, come on. (Emily cheers) (Emily laughs) We got this. We'll get 'em this time. It's so cool that you're coaching these kids. Did you grow up playing? Yeah, I played a little. A little? He was about to be a Clemson Tiger. I didn't know that. Injury? Marriage. Oops. Yeah, I chose love over a scholarship to a ACC powerhouse. But you know, no big deal. Eh, it's kind of a big deal, especially 'cause she left. (Ian chuckles) Thanks for that! You know what? I made a choice. I don't regret it. And I still have a little bit of soccer in my life, so. You must have been really good. You seem surprised. How about that! That's what I'm talking about! Winner buys the next round. - Okay. - All right. Okay Or we can just play. You know, Maya, I gotta thank you. The girls have been so excited to actually work with a professional soccer player. Whoa. What? What about me? (Dion and Maya cheering) Oh! You said winner buys the next round. That's us. You know what? You're our guest. Yeah, we'll get it. (Dion chuckles) Aw. Hey, I gotta say, you took that loss really well. Well, someone taught me that it's okay to just play. Yeah? That person sounds mature and wise. And very good looking. (Emily chuckles) So, how are you? Better. This town's really growing on me. Enough to stay? Let's not get carried away. Good. Because I think Coach Avila might bring you back. Really? (lighthearted music) (Maya chuckles) (lighthearted music continues) Would you like me to go in with you for moral support? Parents aren't allowed, thankfully. (whimsical music) Okay, I'll be right here when you're done. Oh, I'm sure you will be. Team Chen! Okay. Oh. Hey. Here to audition? (Ian chuckles) No. Actually, I'm here to see Sandra. How about you? Why are you here? Ava's trying out for Twelfth Night! Oh, she is? That's cool. She inside already? I don't know. I'm not allowed in. Yeah, I know. There was a local stage mom who ruined it for everybody. Who? Eh, I don't know if I should tell you. Sheila. (Emily chuckles) Well, it's fine. I should probably respect that and give her space. Yeah. You could do that. Or... Ooh. Come here. (lighthearted music) Can you see her? No. Oh, yes! I see her! Yeah. What is she doing? She's walking on stage. She looks so confident. Exquisite and unmatchable beauty, I pray you! The director's clapping. (man claps) She's smiling. Yeah. (Ian sneezes) (man claps) (whistle blows) Let's show them what we're made of! Lower! That's good! Shuffle, shuffle. Side shuffle. That's good, South. Good, Spencer. Good hustle. Good hustle. That's it, Darr. (whistle blows) Going lower, Chen, going lower. Yes, yes, yes, yes. (whistle blows) - All right. - All right, everybody. Good job, ladies. Good job. Bring it in. Circle up, circle up. All right. Wonderful. Great. We are taking the rest of the week off. We have no more practice. I want you to eat good food, not junk food. Don't stay up late watching TikTok and doing whatever you guys do, because we gotta get ready for the semi-finals. [All] Yeah! Who are we? [All] Purple Thunder! Great practice. Good practice. Whew. (stomach grumbles) Whoa, hang on. Is that you? Oh, I think that was a bobcat that snarled. (Ian and Emily chuckling) Yeah, that was me. I could use a bread bowl right about now. Thanks for asking. You're hungry? You know, tonight would be a good night for a cooking lesson. - All right. - Yeah? See you later. (lighthearted music) So basically, we're making a fancy pizza? Ah-ah, no. It's mushroom ricotta galette. It's French. Mm. Dough. Cheese. Sauce. That's a pizza. (Ian chuckles) It is a pizza, isn't it? Yeah, but you know, and it's the best pizza that you'll ever taste. I'll be the judge of that. Yeah? You? Quick to judge? Imagine that. Judging me, judge. (Emily chuckles) So, how'd you get into cooking? Tell you what, I'm gonna cut mushrooms. You shred cheese, and I will tell you the story about when my ex-wife was in medical school, and I was home a lot alone in the early years of our marriage. And in order to keep myself entertained and a lot less lonely, I started watching the Cooking Channel. And I don't know, I started challenging myself while making more elaborate meals, and it sort of became a hobby. What's a hobby? Okay, I know you're joking, but you know, I haven't heard you talk about anything that lights you up other than soccer. Truthfully, I don't even know. Soccer has been my life for the last 20 years. If I'm not playing or training, then I'm watching and analyzing. I didn't realize how sad it was until recently. Yeah, it's sad. It's very sad. It's sad indeed. Judgey McJudgey. Ah. (Ian chuckles) Actually, when Ava said that she was gonna audition, I was kind of relieved. I never got to be a kid or have fun. I don't want that for her. I missed out on a lot. Yeah? Like what? Like pinewood derby races in summer camp. Okay, that's oddly specific. And that trip to the water slide in eighth grade. Actually, no. I don't think so. Everybody got norovirus. Ew. Hopefully not on the water slides. I never got to paper mâche those ridiculous giant floats for homecoming. Given this a lot of thought, haven't you? Free time will do that to you. Anyway, enough about me. What about you? How'd you end up in Southern Pines? Well, Southern Pines is my hometown. I love it here. So after medical school, we moved back, and then she left. Why? Um... Small town. Glass ceiling. She had huge dreams. She wanted a big city, so she left. You didn't wanna go with her? No, I would've loved to have gone with her, but she had this theory that she could either be a great doctor or a great wife, but not both. So, you know, she left. And God speed to her. She's an amazing doctor and it gives her joy, and I am happy for her, but that wasn't for me. You know? I love it here. It's my home. This is where I live. I'm never gonna leave. Why? Okay. I could tell you why, but I think I'd rather show you. (lighthearted music) Mm. [Ian] It's beautiful, isn't it? Wow. How have I never seen this before? I guess I'm just not in town as much as I should be. Now, is that just the traveling or... Yeah, and I've kind of been avoiding this place ever since Ava's mom, Caroline, passed away. Okay. Like, I know that she's not in the picture, but I never wanted to pry. Cancer. That's awful. Yeah. It sucks. Were you guys close? Actually, she was my best friend. I was the one that introduced her to Brandon. We played soccer together at 1C, and we both got picked up with the Triumphs. When she passed away, I kind of lost it, like with the team. Played in Europe for a few years and... Anything, really, to avoid it. Yeah. But that's not how grief works, is it? Yeah, that's what I'm realizing. And I'm also learning that it's better to spend time with the ones you love than to avoid the pain of the ones you've lost. Yeah. I know something about trying to avoid the pain. All right. This is why I brought you here. Okay. So, you're gonna lay on this table. I know, you gotta trust me. Mhm. Lay down. And... Behold. Wow. [Ian] It's pretty, isn't it? Oh my gosh. It's beautiful. You know, you spoke about avoiding the pain of the ones you're lost. Well, I have been avoiding myself after my divorce. I feel like, I guess, having failed at the one thing was supposed to last forever. I'm just, I don't know... I'm afraid to try anything. Is that why you gave up on your sports complex? I mean, you help businesses every day. There's no one more qualified than you. Thank you for saying that. I mean, you have to remember, you can just as easily fail in something you don't want, as in something you want. (Ian and Emily chuckling) That is a terrifying thought. Thank you for that. (Emily chuckles) (lighthearted music) [Emily] I'm confused. [Ian] What about? You live in Southern Pines for the stars? No. I live in Southern Pines for the feeling that I have here. (lighthearted music) I feel it too. (lighthearted music) (lighthearted music continues) Oh, I got the part! (Emily gasps) Congratulations! (Ava screeches) Congratulations! Oh my gosh! I thought you were training! She's a sneaky one. I'm so proud of you. [All] Team Chen! (Emily and Ava laughing) How was your first rehearsal? Good. It's so much different than soccer. What's wrong? I'm excited. I really am. But I also feel guilty. Like, I'm not gonna be following in my mama's footsteps. Or yours. Ava, I'm so sorry. Hey, I didn't mean to put all this pressure on you. Your mom... Would've been thrilled for you. You sure you're not disappointed? Never. (melancholic music) (lighthearted music) Ah, right there. Pinewood derby carts. (Ian laughs) I figured since you didn't get to make these as a kid, we can just make some of our own. I can't believe you did all this. (Ian chuckles) (wistful piano music) Can I ask you something? Yeah. Humility aside... I'm a gold mine of advice for your players. How come you never ask me about my career? Because I don't wanna treat you differently because you're this amazing, famous soccer player. Trust me, I know how impressive your resume is, but I like to evaluate people based on their personalities, not their accomplishments. You think I'm amazing? (Ian and Emily laughing) Yeah. I think that that's pretty amazing, number one. I channeled eight year old Emily, and this is what she's always wanted. Well, she got what she wanted. Yeah. But can you hold onto the title? Oh, yeah. Are you ready to lose? Oh! All right, you put your racer right on the track. Just like that, okay? Okay. On your marks... Get set... - Hey. - What? Win or lose, today's been really special. I don't think anyone's ever done something this thoughtful to me before. Well, you're welcome. Okay, go! Hey, wait a minute! Yay! I won! Yeah, of course you won. (Emily chuckles) You cheated. You want some pancakes? Yeah! Come on. All right, your pancake's up. You ready for it? Okay. Good. Okay. You want some syrup? Mhm. Mm. Okay. Thank you. You're right. This is the only way to have pancakes. Mm. What do you think? Mm. You have a gift. (Ian chuckles) All right, don't say things you don't mean. Seriously. What's that look? This is the look of me thinking you should stick around. Stick around in Southern Pines? Southern Pines, for the team... Me. (soft tense music) Um... I guess we should go, huh? Yeah, yeah. We should. (lighthearted music) (Ian chuckles) (whistle blows) (people cheering) (people continue cheering) (people cheering) (whistle blows) We won! (people cheering) (Ian laughs) Purple Thunder! (people cheering) We're going to the championship! That's my girls! Hey, Emily. Hey. What are you... What are you doing later? Wanna go over strategy? (Ian chuckles) I was thinking we could shelve the soccer talk and I don't know, get out of these clothes. You're being super vague. A date. I'm asking you out on a proper date. (Emily chuckles) Well, technically, we've been out a bunch already. No, I know, but I'm thinking it's time we make it official. Like, an official date. I'd love to. Yeah? I know an incredible tapas- I'm in. (Ian chuckles) I'll pick you up at 5 o'clock. Okay. [Ian] Bye. Bye. (lighthearted music) Okay. Ooh! Was that Coach Ian? You're half right. Coach Avila. (Ava gasps) Does she want you back on the team? That could be a possibility. Mhm. How would you feel about that? I'm gonna tell you what my wise aunt told me. I'm gonna be here for you, no matter what. Oh... (calming music) Whatever it is I decide, I promise, we're gonna see more of each other. I know. And I'll be here for the championships. Deal? Deal. (Emily and Ava chuckling) Wow, look at this. I know. Are you ready for tonight? Oh, I got this. Yeah, you were born ready. Team Chen. [Ava] Team Chen! Yeah! Oh, can I help you with that? Oh. I'm Emily. I don't think we've officially met. Yeah, Ava's aunt, right? That's right. Mhm. You can just put that over there. Can I help you with anything else? (Sandra chuckles) Not unless you wanna paint sets. I'm no Picasso, but if you need help, I'm in. And I could recruit others too. (lighthearted music) Thank you. Yeah. Come right this way. Uh, we're outta paint. Oh, I'll get it. Yeah? You don't mind? Mhm. Hi, Sandra. We need more paint. Hey! That is a very good looking painting outfit you have on there. Thank you. Mhm. And I love the heels. Yeah, it's really easy to paint with heels on. (Sandra chuckles) Wow. Someone's not so much the outsider anymore. It's really nice to be part of the community. Yeah, pretty soon you'll be running for mayor. (Emily chuckles) Okay. Cheers. Wasn't all that bad, was it? Mm. Hey, and look at us! We still got to wear our fancy clothes. Yes. You... You look fantastic. Thank you, handsome. I know that we weren't supposed to talk about soccer on our date, but I have one thing that I want to say. I think our girls are gonna win the championship. Wait, I'm sorry. Did you just say "win"? Yeah. Aren't you the guy who doesn't believe in winning? (Ian chuckles) Oh my gosh. Well, I gotta say it feels really good to have a little bit of that competitive fire back, and I have you to thank for it. (romantic music) Oh! You're welcome. No! (Emily laughs) It's on! Get ready. I'm gonna ruin that pretty dress of yours. Oh, no, I dare you. I dare you. (cell phone rings) All right, you... Are lucky. Saved by the bell? Yeah, I was gonna carry some stuff. I'll be right back. (cell phone rings) Coach. Maya said you talked, but I wanted to make it official. You're reinstated. So, what do you say? Yes. I wanna come back. (lighthearted music) You're going back to Chicago? I guess I am. How long have you known? Maya said it was a possibility, but I just got the official word. I've had so much fun with you, but this is my career. You understand? Yeah, of course. Of course I understand. But also, it feels like we have something. (mellow music) We definitely do have something. But also, I've been down this road. I know how hard it is with me constantly traveling. It's never worked before. Yeah, but also... It's never been you and me before. (soft music) Wow. What? I just realized that I have a type. That's not fair. I don't put my package on you. No, because that would mean you'd have to let me in, which is something I think you might be incapable of. I'm sorry. I don't mean to say that. It's fine. I want you to be happy. I want you to succeed. And I think what we have to do is just focus on the girls and get them to the championship, and then at least they can have a win. (melancholic piano music) (Emily grunts) (Emily grunts) (Emily exhales) (rain patters) Em. Stop punishing yourself. I'm not punishing myself. I'm training. Sure, yeah. Go for it. Ava, why don't you get your auntie a towel? Em? Doing okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Just... Just, what did he think? That I was gonna give up my career and uproot my life? He knew I wanted back on the team. Yeah, sure. But maybe he thought he was the team too. (melancholic music) (cell phone rings) Who is it? Hello? Oh, hi, Coach. I understand. Natalie is injured. Coach needs me back in Chicago immediately. (melancholic music) So you're not gonna be there for the championships? I'm so sorry. It's fine. I knew you'd leave. Oh... (melancholic music) (melancholic music continues) (knocking) Oh, hey. Hey. I just came here to tell you that I'm going back to Chicago sooner than expected. In fact, I'm heading there now. (melancholic music) Wow. I'm sorry, I'm not gonna be here for the championships. But you don't need me. (Ian chuckles) No. No. We'll be fine. Why did you come tell me this in person? I... It's just... I don't know. Okay. Have a really good flight. Goodbye. (door slams) (melancholic music) We should go. (engine revs) (soft music) Ava, I'm sorry. I'm not leaving you. I'm just... We're gonna video chat all the time, and I'm gonna visit so much you're gonna be sick of me. (Ava chuckles) I could never get sick of you. Clearly you've never had to share a room with her. Ha, ha, ha. (Brandon chuckles) For the ride. Oh... I don't deserve you. Yes, you do. And I deserve you. (melancholic music) I'll come around a lot. Good. 'Cause it doesn't have to be either soccer or us. I know. Because... We need you. (melancholic music) I miss you guys already. (wistful lighthearted music) (wistful lighthearted music) Chen is back, baby! (Emily chuckles) (people cheering) It's so good to have you back. It's good to be back. [Teammate] Yeah, let's win this! [Teammate 2] Yeah, we got our star player back... (lighthearted music) (ball thuds) Keep it going. Good. Think we still have a shot? We'll be fine without her, Sheila. Oh, okay. (whistle blows) Okay. Okay, nice, nice. Nice. Sharp, sharp. Nice, in the corner. Okay, here we go. Here we go. It's okay, it's okay. (melancholic music) She'll get there. Yeah. All right. (Coach Avila claps) Let's go! [Ava] Hi, Cucu! Just leaving rehearsal. Every time I call you, you're in the middle of rehearsal. I know. Our rehearsal schedule has been intense, but I'm totally off book now, and we just finished blocking our last scene. I don't understand half of what you just said, but you sound super professional. I can't believe I'm gonna miss your big debut. I know. Same. But I completely understand. We working women have important demands to keep up with. Exactly. (Emily chuckles) Go. Have fun. Okay, love ya! (mellow music) Thank you. Look what I got. Oh my gosh. - They're done. - Oh my God! They're exactly the same size. Yeah, not really, but- Yeah, okay. How can I help you? You taught me something really valuable... (lighthearted music) Hey! Just wanted to wish you good luck... I mean, to tell you break a leg. Thanks, Dad. I'm just a little bummed that Auntie Em isn't gonna be here. Surprise! (Emily laughs) Auntie Em! I'm so happy you're here! I'm so proud of you! (bell dings) - Okay. - Okay. We gotta go. Bye! (lighthearted music) I'm so excited. Oh, hey. How are you? Good, good. Wasn't sitting there when I put my coat down. Uh huh. (soft music) I thought you were in Chicago. It hit me that I wouldn't miss Ava's big opening, so I just... [Man] Give me excess of it that, surfeiting, the appetite may sicken- We can talk later. [Man] And so die. (dramatic music) What country, friends, is this? This is Illyria, lady. And what should I do in Illyria? She's so good. Yeah, she is. [Man] Assure yourself. And so perchance, may he be. ♪ What's to come is still unsure ♪ ♪ In delay, there lies no plenty ♪ ♪ But that's all one ♪ ♪ Our play is done ♪ ♪ And we'll strive to please you every day ♪ (people cheering) (lighthearted music) Ava! She's so good! I'm gonna go find Ava. Be right there. You're back. I guess I realized that it doesn't have to be either soccer or... Being here. I can be both a great soccer player and a great person. Yeah, you can. I was hoping I could still coach the championship with you. That should be fine. As long as we can both agree to keep things professional. But I don't want to... (Ava laughs) Oh! Hi! Oh my gosh! There she is. Kid, you were amazing on stage. You were a natural. Thanks, Coach. You were incredible. Like a young Michelle Yeoh. You really think? Oh, yeah. I sobbed. And the last time that I cried, was when Gabby Ackerman kicked my thigh with her cleats. It's true. (Ava chuckles) - Oh! - You were so great, kiddo! (Ava and Brandon chuckling) Yay! Team Chen! (Brandon and Ava chuckling) (lighthearted music) (TV chatters) Thought you could use these. [Reporter] And are looking very strong, as we open up the... You ready for today? I should be asking you that. You don't always have to be so strong, Cucu. It's okay to be sad. You're the best. (lighthearted music) Seriously? Who raised you? (Ava chuckles) - This guy! - Oh! Oh, yeah, okay. The "cool dad". Way to ruin a moment, Dad. Ava. Can you help me out? All right! Woo! Okay, girls, you've been working so hard, so I just wanted to get you something special. - Thank you! - Thank you! That's cool. All right, I want you to remember, when you're out there, have fun! But also, girls, we can win this thing. But more importantly, enjoy yourselves. (Ian and Emily chuckling) Okay, one more thing. The goalkeeper is very tall, so keep your shots on the ground. (Ian chuckles) All right, on three. Purple Thunder, one, two, three! [All] Purple Thunder! Go get 'em, go get 'em, go get 'em. You, listen. You're fast. And I want you to be fast. I had no idea that you could do the things that you can do, so do it, go in. Okay? Okay. And have fun. Have fun. [Sheila] Finals! Right? I mean, oh my gosh. Well... - Coach. - Ava. Hey, what's this? My aunt also had these made. Thank you. (lighthearted music) (lighthearted music continues) So, I made a slight adjustment. (Emily chuckles) Coach. Ava. Yeah, she's a good girl. I'm sorry I pushed you away. I'm just... I don't have the best track record, and I'm not always great at being on a team. I know. You got a whole year in Chicago to work on that, so. Actually, I realized that Chicago isn't for me anymore. I mean, I got everything that I thought I wanted, and instead of feeling joy, I felt alone. It's like I have all the success in the world and it just tastes like ash. So I asked Coach to move me closer to home. Wait, what? Are you kid... (Ian chuckles) Are you kidding? You're playing for the Triumphs? Yeah. In Seattle? Like an hour away? (Ian and Emily chuckling) So I'm gonna have so much time to help you with the complex, if you decide to do it. Well, I hope I decide to do it, because I signed the lease. Yes! (lighthearted music) (whistle blows) Yeah! - Let's go Thunder! - Come on, Thunder! Over here! Pass it to Chen. Go, go, go, go, go, go!
