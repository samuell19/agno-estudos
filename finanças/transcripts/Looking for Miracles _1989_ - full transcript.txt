(horn honking) (hammer tapping) - [Young Man] Where's Mr. Manouche? - Sold the business. - [Young Man] Are you Mr. Schultz? - [Man] Yeah. - I worked for Mr. Manouche last summer. I know the route, and I thought-- - Well, I've got my son. - Couldn't you use the two of us? I know all the customers. - You wanna split your salary, John? - What salary? (Schultz laughs) (tongue clucks) - Ice, we've got ice! Ice! (gentle music) - [Young Man] I can't afford to buy any. - [Teen Boy] I can't believe you're gonna steal some guy's clothes! - [Young Man] It's not stealing, it's a loan. Look, I'm just gonna borrow them for graduation. - [Teen Boy] This is crazy, Delaney! - Jackpot. They're perfect. - [Teen Boy] Forget it, Ryan. They'll kick you off the minute you set foot on the turf. - Lookit, he's my size. This is too good to pass up. Wait here. - Delaney! Knock it off! If you're caught, you're dead, and I'm not floatin' for you! Cripes. - [Man] Move along, son. Move along. - What kind of locker room attendant are you? (upbeat music) - Remember, this is never goin' to happen again. You only get to graduate once, so don't move. Smile, everyone. Hold it now. The class of 1935. (audience applauding) (upbeat music) - I now take pleasure in presenting the citywide award given to the top student in every school who possesses that combination of scholastic ability and personal integrity that has earned him the esteem of his peers. This year's winner is Ryan Delaney! (audience applauding) (gentle music) - [Woman] Ryan, is that you? - Hi, Ma. I've been awarded a scholarship, Ma. - Oh. Tell me all about your graduation. I'm so upset I had to miss it. That's the last double shift I'm on now for another month. - Here. That'll pay my tuition next year. - Oh, that's wonderful, sweetie. Your Dad'd be so proud of you. But this doesn't pay for the whole expense. Ryan, how can I afford to let you go to university? We need you to get a permanent job. - This is a scholarship. - Goin' to university means books and God knows what other extras. I can barely keep up with the rent. - I don't want us to live this way anymore, Ma! Lawyers make lots of money. - That takes time. What if I get TB again? Where's our money gonna come from? If you get a steady job, maybe we could afford to send for Sullivan. It just breaks my heart having to keep him away like this for months at a time. Last time I telephoned him he said he was upset because he couldn't hug me over the telephone. I'm countin' on you, Ryan. You're the man of the family. (children playing) (church bells ringing) - Mm hmm. We shall have to have your scholarship processed before we defer your tuition fees. You'll receive confirmation in the mail. - Thanks. You're lucky you got your uncle's farm to go to in the summer. - I heard about a job the other day. I don't know if they'd hire ya, though. - What do you mean? It's a job, isn't it? A J-O-B? Unless I get one, I can't even afford to go to this place! Goodbye law school, goodbye everything. - My cousin Bobby told me that this women's league society has started a camp for kids whose families are on relief. And they need counselors, but you gotta be 18. - I can look 18. - But you don't know anything about camping. - What's to know about camping? You take kids swimmin' and stuff. - Can ya swim? - No. So I'll take 'em on hikes. - When I think of some of the finky counselors I had at camp, I guess you got about as much chance as anybody. - God, Billy, where do I get an interview? - I think it's over at the rec center at City Hall. But if you see Bobby, don't tell him I gave you the idea. - I got an interview for next Thursday. That gives me less than a week to become an experienced camp counselor. - Where is this camp? - I don't know, up north someplace. - A summer job seems like a waste of time to me. (hand knocking) - [Woman] Effie? Effie, are ya there? Open up! - It's Maureen. What are you doing in town? Sullivan. - Hello, Ryan. Oh, I'm sorry, Effie, to barge in on you like this. - Oh, come in, come in. I was just off to work, Maureen, but if I'd known you were comin'- - George lost his job last week. - Oh, Maureen, no. What happened? - Business was tight. The bank closed her down. We can't keep Sullivan anymore, Effie. You have to take him back. - But I just found this job. I wanted to send the money for him, but- - I'm not askin' ya for the money. - Well, maybe Bridget could take him just for a little while till Ryan gets a job. - Good Lord, Effie, you're his mother! While Bridget's had him for three years! You've got your health now. You can manage. Goodbye, Sullivan. Bye, Effie. I'm sorry. - I appreciate you helpin' me for as long as you could, Maureen. Give my love to George and the little ones. - [Maureen] Goodbye, Sullivan. - Good luck, now. (melancholy music) Well, come in and shut the door, for Pete's sake. Oh, dear. Put this in your room, will you, Ryan? Of course we're glad to have you home again, Sullivan. But, but I'm late for work. I simply have to go. - I can't take care of him. I've got a million things to do. - And why not? Oh now, don't be difficult, Ryan. I'll be back at midnight. Sullivan, you mind your brother now. (gentle music) - Well, come on. - Aunt Bridget said you were tryin' to have chicks last year and maybe you'd sell 'em to a pet shop. - It's a male bird. They don't have chicks. - You're sayin' your idea didn't work out, huh? - That's right. Sullivan, why don't you go out on the fire escape and talk to Mrs. O'Reilly upstairs? - I'd rather talk to you. - Yeah, well, I'm goin' out. I am not your babysitter, so let's just leave it at that, okay? You can come with me just this once, but you're not hangin' around me all summer. You understand? Come on. (gentle music) - I'm know I'm not supposed to talk to you, but are you studying for an exam or somethin'? - No, a job. - Why? - So I can make some money. - I wanna be like you, and we'll write a book on how to make money. - Yeah, right, Sullivan. - I got lots of ideas lyin' around in my head. How about a wash your car in your own driveway service or a running errands company or a collecting bottles for two cents refund? Then we could buy a lady canary and have a baby bird supply to pet shops. - Sullivan, how about a do me a favor company that specializes in buttoning your mouth shut? - [Sullivan] If you didn't like them, I got more. - Chickachuck. (paper ripping) (Ryan coughs) Would you quit crowdin' the bed? - I ain't crowdin'. You're on my side. - See that line? That is your side of the bed. This is my side of the bed. Keep your biscuit hooks on your side of the bed! (sighs) (cat meows) (dog barks) - Hi, what ya doin'? - The stars. Go back to sleep and don't bug me. - Whatcha lookin' for? - The Ursa Major. - Don't you see it? - No, I don't see it. - Like it says in the book, it's right there, alongside of the little bear and next to the big dipper. (gentle music) Why do you wanna go to the university so badly? - It's the most important thing in the world. It's the only way we're gonna have enough money. Now, go back to bed and quit actin' like my shadow! - I just know you're gonna go to university. - (sighs) I still got a half an hour. I hope I don't seem too anxious. - You look great. - (sighs) Come on. Wait here, I'll be right out. - May I help you? - I have an appointment to see Mr. Berman. - Oh, your name? - Ryan Delaney, ma'am. - Ryan Delaney. - Yes, sir, Mr. Berman, sir. - Chief Berman to you. You a leader, Brian? - How do you mean, Chief? - Well, are you the take-charge type? - Well, this might sound like bragging, but I- - That's all right. I don't mind a man that can blow his own horn. - Yes, sir. Well, I was captain of most everything I did at school. Baseball, debate team, dramatic society, tennis team, photography club, science club. And I was president of my senior class. - Really? How old are you? - Uh, 18, Mr. Berman. Uh, Chief. - What experience have you had? - Oh, at Camp Chickachuck in Nova Scotia, I was a junior counselor and then a counselor for two years. - Really? I knew Nate Stewart. Used to be little big chief there for years. - Uh huh, yeah. And I worked on my uncle's farm in the summer, in Alberta. - That so? (phone rings) What is owl eye? - Lemme show ya, Chief. It's what the Algonkian did at dusk. Cup your fingers like this over your eyes to concentrate the light surrounding the deer. Well, try it, Chief, you'll see what I mean. Then you have to get up on the balls of your feet, slightly pigeon toed downwind because it's a contest of the senses, yours versus the deer's. On average, most hunting enthusiasts aim too high. Once you're within range, pull out your bow and arrow, let out your breath all the way. (air whooshing) I really enjoyed being a counselor at Chickachuck, but this summer, I'd like to have a challenge. - Would you like an application to go to Camp Hochelaga? - Uh, no. I'm just waiting for my friend. (young man laughs) By the look of a lot of these creepers, they ain't got a chance against him. He's memorized the camp manuals cover to cover. - I been camp director for 15 years. I've seen good counselors, I've seen bad. Had one counselor in here couldn't even swim. - Can you imagine anybody applying for a job as a counselor when they can't swim? (laughs) - I kicked him outta there so fast, he didn't know he had a seat left to sit on. - I should think so. - Now, I don't want any country club counselors. I want rugged young men who can meet the challenge. - That's my kinda camp, Chief. - Good. Send in the next boy. - How did you do? Did he hire ya? - What are you doin' here? I told you to wait in the hall! - Mr. Scott? Oh, if you come back at three o'clock, we can tell ya if you got the job or not. - What the heck are you doin' sneakin' in like that? No 18 year old babysits his little brother! - I told 'em I was a friend. Lemme tell ya, they're loonies not to hire you. - I laid it on too thick! Captain of everything and all that junk. - I thought your answers were great. You sounded just like Jack Dempsey on the radio after a fight. - What if he checks Camp Chickachuck and finds out I'm an imposter? - He won't. - It'd be just my luck, he'll call the school and find out I'm only 16! - I betcha he won't. Wait up, Ryan! (gentle music) What'll you do if you don't get the job then? - Not go to university, whatta ya think? - But you just gotta go to university. - Sullivan, just drop it! - But you always get what you want. (horn honking) - I only get the things I know I can do. - But you can do everything. - No, I can't. - Name one thing you can't do. - Swim! - [Chief] And I don't want those canoes taken out of the barn until we get there! - Uh, you told me to come back at three. - Well, you can't go in now. - Send them all back! - He's on the telephone. - Some drunk in Bethel'll likely take one out and drown! I don't care, send them all back! And don't deliver them till opening day! I have a problem with you. I was terribly impressed with your camping know-how, but you're too young to be an assistant director, and you know too much to be a counselor. I've decided the other counselors would probably resent you. - I don't know as much as I sound like I know. - You are very knowledgeable. - Yes, sir. - You have an absolutely brilliant understanding of astronomy and Indian lore. - I do? - You think you can handle 10 year olds? - Why, sure. I have a brother who's 10. He and his friends hang around me all the time. 10 year olds are my favorite. - Well, I'm gonna offer you the job as the head counselor of the Indian Mound section. - Head counselor? - Now, it's only an extra $2 a week. - Aw, I really enjoy leadership, Chief. - Well, half of our campers are sponsored by a relief project. Some of them can be a real handful. The other half come from good homes. They'll be paying fees, so it's kinda like the haves against the have-nots. - Don't worry about me, Chief. I've been both. (door closes) Me big chief counselor for $12 a week. - I knew it, I knew it. Did he ask if you could swim? - Nah. Besides, for that amount of money, I'd a said I'd fly the Pacific in the Spirit of St. Louis. - Are you outta your head, Ryan Delaney? What about Sullivan? - I told you last week I was applying. - I thought you were going to get a good daytime job so you could look after your brother at night. - This is a good daytime job. - You'll be lookin' after other people's kids. What's wrong with lookin' after your own brother? Maybe you could get a job with Mr. Kootz at the pharmacy, a delivery job. Maybe you- - Listen, Ma. I gotta go to university in the fall. This is our only chance. (melancholy music) What are you guys doin'? Beat it! Hey. I got ya in. I'm takin' ya to camp. You're gonna be in my village. - But I don't have nothin' for camp. - You don't need nothin'. - Well, what if I get attacked by a bear or somethin'? - There are no bears there. - I won't know anybody. - If I give you my pocket knife will you come? Just don't lose it. (gentle music) - I'm worried about Ma. She won't have anybody else if we leave her. She's never gonna go for this. - Don't say anythin'. I'm not tellin' her anything till the last minute. (sighs) - Are you still worried about swimmin'? - No, I'm worried about when I get in the water the first day and drown. Go to sleep. Gotta get up early. (horn honking) (upbeat music) - I think this is a ridiculous idea. Just 'cause I'm lettin' ya go to camp this summer doesn't mean to say you can go to university in the fall. Sooner or later, Ryan Delaney, you'll be found out, and you can just march right on home and face reality. You know, you won't last the summer. - [Announcer] Passengers for Kitchener or Waterloo, Stratford, Wilton and St. Thomas, the bus is now boarding. - Crowder! (light music) - [Ryan] Bye now. - Sullivan, you mind your brother now. You do his bidding. - It's nice that we got you up here. - [Effie] You be careful. - I guess you can go now, Ma. They want us on the bus. - All right, goodbye then. I'm sure you'll forget all about me. (gentle music) Now go on, and don't forget to write. And send me a postcard of the lakes and the towns. - Yeah, sure, Ma. - Don't let them be rough to Sullivan. He's your brother. - How can I forget. - Sullivan, you be careful. You stick up for him. Bye. (upbeat harmonica music) ♪ Camp Hochelaga is a sweat box ♪ ♪ There ain't no dames for miles around ♪ ♪ And you'll gripe about the lousy grub ♪ ♪ Chief don't run no country club ♪ ♪ Powder puffs and pansies hit the ground ♪ ♪ Camp Hochelaga is a sweat box ♪ (cheerful music) - Stay here and don't move. - Hi. - Ryan Delaney. - Mo Brennan. You, uh, head counselor at Indian Mound? Well, I'm one of your counselors. I teach wrestling. - Nice to meet you. - Come here, I wanna speak to you. Who's that? - My name is- - This is just a camp gopher. You know, go for this, go for that. - I'm really cheesed off, you know? Like I said, wrestling's my specialty, and now big chief pain in the neck tells me I'm switched to volleyball. (scoffs) - Yeah, well, big emphasis on team sports, you know. - I'll run a team sport for him. There's a girl's camp across the lake. You're a cabin leader. It's up to you to tell big chief old Mo is here for wrestling and boxing and not jerkin' around with volleyball. He's over there havin' a soda. You go speak to him. - Well, why don't we wait till we actually get to camp? - What for? Tell him now! - I think it'd be best to discuss it at camp, quietly, when he doesn't have so much on his mind. - Well, all right. And tell him he better think about what I said. I'd speak to him myself, but I have a tendency to lose my temper. - Leave it to me, Brennan. - Gee, whatcha gonna do, Ryan? - Oh, I'll figure somethin' out. Don't look so worried! People'll think I can't handle it. Come on. (horn honking) (mellow music) - Now, we have three days to get ready for the kids, men, and I have something special I want to show you. Now, during construction of this camp three years ago, these Indian relics were discovered onsite. Now, these little pieces of bone were found right beneath the pump house. All these little artifacts are irrefutable proof that Indians once lived on the shores of this lake. Indian is going to be our motif. This summer, I want Hochelaga full of little braves again. I want pow wows and rain dances, braves on the warpath, kids in loincloth, the works! - Last year it was lumbermen and voyagers. (counselors laughs) - Now, we are extremely fortunate to have with us, on staff, a counselor who is more steeped in Indian knowledge than any counselor who's ever worked for me before. Now, Ryan, will you please step forward? Now, Ryan Delaney is the head counselor of Indian Mound Village. Now, he doesn't know this, but I'm putting him in charge of Indianizing the whole camp. Ryan, I want you to bring a new vision to Hochelaga. But I'm also going to ask you to organize an overnight canoe trip for the Indian Mound. I expect everyone to listen very carefully to everything Ryan has to say. (young man burps) - Camp you say you worked at, Delaney? - Camp Chickachuck in Nova Scotia. - Never heard of the dump. - Myron, quit steppin' on my heels! (Myron burps) If you do that again, your head's gonna be rollin' between your ankles. - Dom, Chickachuck's one of the best camps on the East Coast. Great tennis facilities I hear. - Yeah, yeah, we did. - Well, it's a heck of a lot better than the cow patch we have here. I'd really like to have you a game sometime. - Sure. Sure, once we get rollin'. - [Counselor In Vest] Hey, Delaney, did you know a counselor at Chickachuck called Spike Turner? - [Ryan] Uh, what year was he there? - [Counselor In Vest] '30, '33, I think. - [Ryan] I missed that summer. I had the measles. - [Mo] You guys quit your yappin'. Let's get this stuff put away. - Watch it, ya big goof! - Get outta my way. Get those mattresses out. - What a dump! This place stinks! Except you can see the nurse's cabin from up here. - What do you know? - Well, the nurse looks okay, but anybody who pays to come up here has got rocks in his head. - Well, most of these brats ain't payin', so stop standin' there like a cigar store Indian thinkin' about it and help me get these cots set up! - I want you guys to realize that I'm not here for physical labor. The only reason I'm sticking it out here is so my dad'll be convinced that I did something worthwhile this summer. Maybe I can hit him up for a roadster in the fall. - You make me sick, Trimble. Get this little snot transferred to another mound, Delaney. (horn blows) What the hell is that? Out! I'm not livin' with some freak who plays with a brass corkscrew all day. Out! Not in here, now scram! - [Man] Get your paddles, jerks. News ain't comin' till opening day. - You better do something about this, Delaney, or it'll be a long, hot summer. - Relax, Trimble, we're all in this together. You two guys gotta learn to get along. We're all equals. - Delaney, you got a screw loose. That's a kid's paddle. - I'm just makin' my point. - What kinda camp you say you worked at before, Delaney? - [Ryan] Chickachuck. - [Mo] You mean chicken lips. Buck buck buck buck buck buck buck. - The massasauga rattler inhabits this particular area of the camp, and if you keep your eyes open this summer, you're gonna see more than one of them. Now, these guys'll leave you alone if you leave them alone. But if you get bit, you got two hours to get some serum into you or you're pushin' up daisies. Now, I'm gonna give you guys a little pre-camp treat. Let's start real slow, and don't come too close. (rattle rattling) Come to papa. If one of these little suckers happens to hit you up for a snack, use a pocket knife to cut your skin and get someone to suck out the wound. - Watch it, Bates! - Ah! (dramatic music) - Get the first aid kit! Call Blanche! Where did it get ya? - Got me in the ankle. Gimme somethin' to tie around my flank. - I ain't afraid to suck it, Babe. - Murphy, take the small truck into Bethel as fast as you can! I'll try the girls' camp. - You gotta get me some sham real quick, Chief. I took a hell of a shot! - You can use mine, Mo. - Blanche, Blanche! Babe got bit down at the dock! - Murphy, that serum won't be here till next week. Make sure you find the doctor. - [Mo] Stay back, Sully. - [Babe] God, I'm gettin' cold. - Let me see him. (tense music) Okay, Mo, keep sucking the blood out with this. Ryan, prop him up, please. - Get me a life jacket. - [Counselor] He's gonna pass out for Pete's sake. - Thanks. Is he gonna die? - I've never seen anyone actually die before. - Wake up. Come on, Babe, wake up! Come on, wake up, Babe, wake up. Come on, please wake up. Wake up! - [Mo] Hey, Delaney. Delaney, wake up! - What happened? - We figured you'd been poisoned too, you jerk. - [Sullivan] You okay? - You passed out, ya yellow belly. - Yeah, well, he hadn't eaten anything all day. Babe's okay, Ryan. They got the serum over at the girls' camp. (bell ringing) - Hey, grub's on. Get your clodhoppers over to the log house if you think you can find your way. - I'll be there in a minute, guys. I'm okay, honest. You go with them, Sullivan. - No. I wanna stay here and make sure you're okay. - [Trimble] Guy faints at the sight of blood. - I don't need my kid brother stickin' up for me! Wise up and watch what you say in front of people. (gentle music) - All right, move out, make room! Attention, forward march! - Gunther, Robert. - Present. - Melborn, Alex. - Salute! - Present. - John. - Right turn. Forward march! - How do you expect to get those canoes through here, for cryin' out loud? - Arnold, why are you so stubborn? Why did you wait until opening day to bring up the canoes. - Get goin' you kids. Delaney, help me unload the truck of those apples. I'm gonna be in the kitchen. I'll be back in a second. Crazy canoes. - I want all campers to the left. - What are they bringin' 'em in here now for? - Counselors, claim your sections. You, with the clipboard, more that truck so we can get the canoes through. - The driver's gone up to the kitchen, ma'am. He'll be back in a minute. - Well, what's wrong with you? You heard me, on the double! All right, now, Indian Mound, Wolverines and Grizzlies, form up in lines to my right. (light music) Hurry up now. Straight lines. You can do better than that. Counselors, please introduce yourselves to your sections. Would you please hurry up and move that truck! Babe is going to explain the practices for all the waterfront activities. (light music) Arnold, what is that fellow up to? Brake! Brake! (horn honks) (kids cheering) Why didn't you brake? - I'm really sorry, ma'am. I don't know how to drive. - Well, why didn't you say so in the first place? - I tried! I tried. - Arnold, he's ruined my shorts. I certainly hope this isn't the way the rest of the summer is going to go, Arnold. (crowd clapping) - I'd like to introduce you boys to Miss Grace Gibson. Now, those of you who were here last year will recall that Miss Gibson not only donated all the land for Hochelaga, but each summer, she's raised money so that many of you kids could come here. Now, she has a summer property on Moon Lake, and she'll spend many daylight hours over here. So when you see her, I want you to say how. - [All] How. - [Chief] She's the reason we're all here. (crowd clapping) - Thank you for starting the season off with such a bang. (crowd laughs) Many of you may not realize, but this lake was opened up over 30 years ago by my late father, Norman L. Gibson. I could envision no better tribute to him than to start up a camp so that you could appreciate the wilderness - Quit it. - he was so fond of. - [Boy] Aw, shut up, loser. This is what we do to squealers, you big tub-o-lard. - Securing the support (harmonica music) for this camp has been one of the most thankless yet gratifying - You're choking me. experiences of my life. - Tub-o-lard. - I hope you will take advantage of this opportunity - Your hat, porky. - and ask any questions. - Oink, oink, oink, oink. (boy snorts) - Do you read bedtime stories to crybabies? 'Cause I got one right here. - No one is ever too big to put over my knee, Theodore Kawalski! (kids laugh) - Theodore. - My name's Ratface, toots! - [Campers] Ratface, Ratface, Ratface, Ratface! Ratface, Ratface, Ratface, Ratface, Ratface, Ratface. - Hey! - Ratface, Ratface, Ratface. - Knock it off. (Ratface spits) - All right, all right, all right! Thank you, Miss Gibson. All right, now, I want all the junior boys to follow Babe. That's the boys 10 years and under. - Come on guys. Over here. - Everybody else, follow me. - Ratface! Try that again, and I'm gonna make your puss uglier than it already is. - [Ratface] You and who else? - 91, 92, 93, 94, - Myron! - 95, 96. - How old do you figure old Blanche is? - 98, 99. I never seen anybody spend more time readin' books and less time paddlin' a canoe. What kinda trip you takin' us on? - Gimme the knife or I'll stick ya! (boys yelling) - [Ryan] Come on. - Gimme the knife or I'll stick ya! - Hey, what's goin' on in here? - [Ryan] Yeah, what are you doin', Sullivan? - It's Ratface again! He took Jeff's compass last night, and now he's tryin' to hoof stuff from everybody! - Bug off! - Just who do you think you are, Ratface? - Damn sight more than you are! Get off me, ya fink! - Ow! - Gimme my shiv, it's my property! - Okay, everybody get back to their own tents! Let's go! That means you, Ratface! - You guys don't scare me! - Just get goin'! - Out you weasel! - Hey, you better give it back, you stupid gorilla. It's private property! - Shut up, Ratface, before he spears you with it. - You better let that punk know who's boss. - Yeah, I'm gonna chew him out good. - Chew him out? That's the wrong end of him. You gotta talk to this weasel with a stick. - Well, if talk doesn't work, I'll bring him to the chief! - Huh, are you crazy? Every kid in the camp'll be pullin' for Ratface if you go snitchin' to the chief. No, you gotta step on this kid right now, or he's gonna be steppin' on you all summer. - Okay. What's that, Ratface? Open it up. - Up yours. - You heard what I said. - I don't gotta do nothin'. It's private property, and you got no rights to look in it. - Get up! - Up yours. - I said get up! - And I said up yours and up your baby brother's. - Come here, you little twerp! - You wait'll I tell my dad! He's gonna beat you lunkheads to a pulp! - What's all this junk? - Protection! - Yeah, and who protects us against you? - Get your dirty hands off of my stuff, snot face. - Bring him outside, Mo. What are you guys lookin' at? Bend him over. - Up yours, jerk. Ah! Pig's breath! You're really gonna get it when I tell my old man! - Any more backtalk and I'll wear out every broom in the camp on your backside. - You and who else? Your pet gorilla here? - All right, bend him over, Mo, 10 more! - No, no, I didn't mean it, honest. - Then apologize. - For what? - For talkin' back after you were ordered to shut up! - Who was talkin' backtalk? I wasn't talkin' backtalk. - 10 more! - Okay, all right, I apologize! Does that suit your royal highness? - All of you get back to your tents, scram! And don't even look at me sideways, Ratface, or I'll boot your rear so far you won't know you have a seat left to sit on. Let's get this outta here. (light music) - [Mo] I told ya that kid's dangerous, Delaney. - [Ryan] How was I to know he had an arsenal in his trunk? Come on, Sull. - [Ratface] Hey, Sullivan. - Hey, Sullivan, bring me that paddle over there, will ya? Get in the front of the boat. Okay, Ratface, that's enough! You're in my canoe. Get over here and put on your life jacket! - Bug off! - You're stayin' here, Knuckles. I'm puttin' ya on the next overnight. - Oh, that ain't fair. We're always gettin' split up. - We ain't movin'. - Take it up with the chief why don't ya. - Hey, leave him alone! - Get in the bloody canoe, Ratface, before I pulverize ya. - Give him to me, Mo. - Lemme go, lemme go! Pick on somebody your own size, snot face. - You take the lead, I'll bring up the rear. - [Ratface] I don't even wanna go on this stupid canoe trip. - Get in the canoe, and put on your life jacket! (gentle music) - Aw, you can't even paddle. - Oh, pipe down or I'm gonna hit you with it. - [Ratface] Where you takin' us, Delaney? If we don't drown before we get there. - [Ryan] Wise up, Ratface! You're lily dippin'! Pull your own weight or I'll make sure you carry all the supplies in the next portage. - Oh, get off my case. How did you get to be head shmoo if you can't paddle anyway? - Do me a favor, Ratface, keep your arms movin' and keep your trap shut! (gentle music) Paddle! - Hey, Ratface, this one's for you. - I ain't no sucker for a bunch of slave drivers. - Look, I said carry it! - Make me. - Gotta pull your own weight, big guy. - I got Laurel and Hardy in my canoe. They're useless. They can't even paddle a canoe straight. - Hurry it up, twerp. - Yeah, you think you can pick on me 'cause I ain't paid to come to this camp! I'm just as good as all you little wienie heads. You hear me, Delaney? - Put up or shut up. - Quit it, Ratface. Go get some wood. Bug off, ya idiot. - You better wisen up, Ratface. That's not good enough. Now help Moose pick up the wood. - You make me sick, Delaney. This trip's a joke. Why don't you give up and take us all back? - Ryan. - You heard what I said. Go get the wood. - Just try and hit me. You can't do nothin' with a paddle, Mr. Indian Mound! You would probably miss me! Come and get me, wienie head! Betcha can't even swim just like your baby brother! Come on in. I dare ya, ya fake! Did you suck up to the chief to get this job? I bet ya never even been to camp before. I ain't comin' out until he comes in and gets me. - Okay. Okay, Ratface. You can stay in the water till you're blue in the face for all I care, but don't come sniffin' around the camp for any food unless you got four armloads of wood for the campfire. And from now on, no one is even allowed to even speak to Ratface, get me? Every time he opens his big fat gob, you guys don't get fed! And I don't care if you starve to death, you little beggar! - Hey, come on, you guys, don't listen to him. Moose! Can't you take a joke? Hey, come on, you guys. Come on you guys. - Yikes. (Ryan sputters) - Whatcha doin', Ryan? - What are you doin' sneakin' up on me like that? - I wasn't sneakin' up on you. I just didn't want to disturb your concentration. Can you help me try and swim? - I guess so. As swimmin' duds, we're probably about equal. Come on, get yourself wet. Lie forward, and I'll hold you up. Come on, put your face in. Don't be such a chicken. You coward. How are you gonna float if you keep on holdin' onto me like that! - What did you do that for? - You ain't gonna drown. It's only three feet deep. - Oh yeah, well I've never seen you float. You're no better than I am. - Hey, you water babies having your morning dip? - No, I'm just tryin' to toughen him up. He's afraid of the water. - Hey, Sullivan, where did he learn how to swim like that? - (laughs) He never learned how to swim. Come on back, Sull. (melancholy music) Sullivan! I didn't mean anything by it. Come on! - [Trimble] Guess he can't take a joke, huh? - I'm just gonna have a quick dip before breakfast, Joan. Come back here. Come back here! Aren't you Delaney's brother? Do you know you're trespassing? - I'm only overnight. - Are you lost? Don't you realize how dangerous it is out here alone? What's your name? - Sullivan. What are those? - Goggles. - What do they do? - They help me to swim. - I can't swim. - Well, maybe you could if you wore goggles. Come on, I'll show you. Now, the thing about goggles is that you can see under the water. Woops. You can blow bubbles, and it won't get in your eyes. Try it. (bubbles blowing) (Grace laughs) Okay, now. Now, lie on your stomach, and I'll pull you. (kids yelling) - Know what I think? I think this game is for powder puffs. - Sullivan! (kids yelling) - Come on, Sullivan, watch the ball. Give it some time, Mo. It ain't that bad. - I did, in grade six. The chief thinks wrestling's a lousy idea, and thanks a lot for speakin' up for me. Some kinda leader you turned out to be. I got you figured. Get me off volleyball, and I keep my mouth shut. - Okay, I said I'll talk to him. - Okay, when? Every time I talk to you you say okay. - Don't push me! I'll deal with it! - I'll be right behind you. - [Chief] This is a lunch for a distinguished group of ladies! There's absolutely no way you're gonna serve that crummy meatloaf to Miss Gibson's women's league! - What's wrong with my meatloaf? - [Mo] I'm waitin', Delaney. - I'll tell ya. (dishes clatter) Babe, get those kids away from here and down to the waterfront! - Sure, Chief. - Now, I want all the ladies. - Babe, I really gotta talk to the chief about volleyball. - Believe me, you do not want to talk to him today, Delaney. He's like a bear with a burnt backside. - I want that Barry there to serve them! You can't expect them to come in here themselves and pick their food up! Now, can we do that, Floyd? - Could we have just a little sprig of parsley on each plate, too? Just to add a little color, Arnold. - Sure, Miss Gibson. Right, Floyd? - I guess so, Arnold. (hand slams) - I don't mean to keep pestering you, but you could you spare me just five more minutes, Arnold? Just to go over the list of activities. - It'll be my pleasure. - What's that all about? - She thinks her women's league are eatin' at the friggin' Waldorf Astoria. Next time I turn around, she's gonna want flowers on the table. Make lunch, do Moose's birthday cake. I'm gonna go haywire with all these stupid programs! Barry! Bring us out what's left of that boiled beef before I break your arm! - [Barry] Ow! Ah! - You numbskulls are wreckin' my fine cuisine for these old trouts! Hey, I've been lookin' for these. Delaney, you ever thought of becomin' a chef? I could train you, you know. - I'm goin' to university, pre-law. - You don't wanna get stuck in some office, leanin' over a desk. - I don't wanna get stuck in some kitchen either, worried about a paycheck! Be like a toad sittin' in the middle of the road. One day, a car comes by and splat, (frog croaking) you're history. (cheerful music) (horn honking) - [Woman In Car] Ladies, we're here. - Yes, hello. - It looks wonderful. - Arnold, I better go and see May. - [May] Thank you, Charles. - [Campers] How. - [Lady] Hello, Mr. Berman, so nice to see you. - Oh, ladies, how lovely to see you. Oh, May. - [Chief] All right now, three cheers for Moose. Hip, hip. - [Campers] Hooray! - [Chief] Hip, hip. - [Campers] Hooray! - [Chief] Hip, hip. - [Campers] Hooray! - Happy birthday, Moose! - Moose! (campers cheering) - [Campers] Moose, Moose, Moose, Moose! Moose, Moose, Moose, Moose! - Excuse me. This afternoon's program will begin down at the waterfront. Come on, guys! - Here, Delaney. - Thanks, Floyd. - This after. Oh! (campers laughing) - Hey, Delaney, never trust one of them toadstools. (laughs) - These women have at least 500 causes to donate their money to. Your playing the fool does not assist me in winning over their confidence. I am holding you personally responsible for this afternoon proceeding without any more funny business. (gentle music) - I've never been to a sail pass before. What do we do? - Just sit tight and pray you don't tip. - Tip? You mean we might tip? - [Chief] Oh, no, no. - [Woman] It's steep. Thank you very much. - Grace, are you sure this is safe? I mean, didn't the chief say something about looking out for snakes? - Don't be silly. I haven't seen a snake all summer long. - What did she say? - She said that this summer they're particularly long. Oh. - Just keep your eyes open. - Well, you do your side, and I'll do mine. - Oh, Delaney, I want you to take the lead boat, and we'll follow you. And then you can talk briefly about Indian sightseeing. - [Lady] You know which rag I'm talking about, my dear. - [Woman] Are you gonna help us in the boat? - [Chief] Make sure she's nice and comfortable. (campers cheering) - It is suspected by local historians that this is the very sure where Samuel de Champlain met legendary fur traders Radisson and Grosseiliers and concluded a pact between them and the Iroquois Indians, which eventually led to the extermination of the Huron Indians in 1648. (bird screeches) Look up there! Indian legend proclaims that the souls of martyred Indian braves return to earth as birds of prey so that they can take revenge on their enemies, whom they believe to be reincarnated-- (woman screams) (snake rattling) (dramatic music) - Cripes, let me outta here. (light music) Jump! - [Woman] This way. - Jump, Ryan, jump! Jump, Ryan! - [Campers] Jump, jump, jump! - Hurry, hurry, come on. - He's gonna drown, look! - Ha! (adventurous music) - [Grace] Come on. You're almost here. - Ha! Ha! - No, the other side. Oh, somebody! (coughs) He warned us to sit tight. - You all right there? (all cheering) - What a brave young man. - This is the kind of man your magnificent Camp Hachalaga is going to be instrumental in developing. - What we need is more contact sports around here, Chief. Don't you think Mo ought to teach wrestlin' in the morning? - Great suggestion, Delaney. I think we should start a wrestling program immediately. (Mo laughs) Playing fair, that's the important thing. You're a man after my own heart, Delaney. (light music) - Thanks, Chief. - Hey, Sullivan. You think you're some kinda flash, don't ya, 'cause your prissy brother impressed a bunch of lily livered dames! - Yeah! - He's just a puss like you are puss face, except some day they're gonna be callin' you flat head 'cause I'm gonna squash the livin' daylights outta ya! - All right, you bums, knock it off! - [Ratface] We was just foolin' around. - Yeah, well, you're finished foolin' around! Scram! (Sullivan coughing) You okay, Sullivan? Do you know how embarrassing this is for me to have to keep on stickin' up for my little brother all the time? - It's not my fault they're always pickin' on me. - Well, get a group of your friends so they can't pick on ya. - I haven't got any friends. - Whatta you mean you haven't got any friends? (sad music) - The guys in my cabin just pal around together and tell me to go get lost and go walk with someone else. - Well, maybe you haven't tried hard enough. - This one guy, Virgil, I came right out and asked him to be my friend. He said he couldn't. - Why not? - He said he hates me. - Come on, Sullivan, that's stupid. You're imagining it. You want me to switch you to another cabin? - No! I don't need my big brother stickin' up for me neither! (crying) - Kill, make it hurt, make it hurt, make it hurt! Take down. - [All] Hoo-ah! (whistle blows) - Practice freestyle take downs. Alternate partners. Hey, buddy, gotta hand it to you. You sure got results. - Listen, can you do me a favor? - Of course. - Keep an eye out for Sullivan? Maybe give him some special attention? - He has a first-rate center of gravity. He can't even be pulled off his feet. I've seen him. He can take it. Greco formation! Excellent head position, Sully. You keep that up, and you can be stranglin' Lewis some day. Kill, kill, kill, kill - Kill, kill, kill, kill. - [All] Make it hurt, make it hurt, make it hurt! - Take down! - [All] Hoo-ah! (Sullivan coughing) - My father taught me to swim one summer, Sullivan, right here on this very lake just like this. (gentle music) And do you know what he told me? He said, "If you want to swim in this lake, "you have to be as peaceful as it is." All you have to do is let go. If you wanna swim, all you have to do is let go. All you have to do is just let go. Let go. - Let go! Let go, dammit! I'll get you guys! Just let go of me! You ain't gonna catch me with lipstick on my face and wearin' a diaper! - It's not a diaper. It's a loincloth. - It's a diaper! - So how come I'm wearin' one along with all the other counselors? - Maybe you need a diaper. How do I know? (boys laugh) - Take off your pants and put on the loincloth. - Nothin' doin'. I'll write my old man this camp's tryin' to get my pants off! - All right, shut up! Put the loincloth on top of your pants! - All right. But none of that girl's gunk smeared on me! - You're ugly enough without it! If he doesn't have to wear a loincloth, why do I? - All right, enough! Enough! I don't wanna hear another peep outta you twerps! Get back in the game, all of ya. - [Mo] So much for that idea. Okay, guys, pick it up. Let's go, onto the next Indian event. (light music) (people talking) (Indian calls) (people clapping) (lively piano music) - [Knuckles] Mom, Dad, you made it! - Knuckles! Oh, hello, you must be Knuckles' father. I'm the Chief. - Yes, yeah, he is. (sad music) (frog croaking) (melancholy music) - You ain't gonna kill it, are ya? - I might. (sniffles) - Your dad didn't show, huh? - Nah. He can't walk, you know? He was hurt pretty bad in the war. He's sometimes in a veteran hospital. Then sometimes he comes home. That was his bayonet, you know. - Yeah, my dad was in the war too. Except my dad's dead. My ma didn't show neither. - What do you want, Sull? - It's about Ratface. I need his bayonet. - Are you nuts? - It's not his. It belongs to his dad. He got gassed in the war. I think he's pretty sick now. - Since when did you care so much about Ratface? - I think it'd be nice if you let him have it back. He sure wants to have it. I told Ryan you would keep it in your box, and if you took it out it'd be just to look at, okay? (bell ringing) I gotta go. I'm setting tables tonight. - Thanks. Hey, Sullivan. I'm savin' you a wiener. It's the last one. - What'd you do that for? - I don't know. He's always last. He ain't botherin' ya! Don't you feel sick? - [Sullivan] I feel fine. - You'll make a good smoker, I guess. If you keep it up. (Sullivan coughs) Bet ya never even tasted beer! - I tasted it. - Beer is the most wonderful thing I've ever drunk. Sometimes, me and my old man would sit on the stoop at night, just drink cold bottles of it, watchin' everything go by. - Don't you get drunk? - Nah. It just makes you feel good sittin' there with your old man. Most of the time, you don't feel that good though. - My brother tasted beer once, and he hated it. - Is your brother a creep? I can't make up my mind about him. - 'Cause he don't like beer? - He don't like me. - Sometimes Ryan don't like me neither. - [Ratface] And you know somethin', Delaney? I ain't the kind of person nobody likes. - But I like you. - Nah, you just wanna stay on my good side. - If somethin' ever happened to you, I'd come around, and I'd bring you things. - You'd do that? - You bet I would. - Yeah, well, my old man's always tellin' me about all the friends he used to have. No one comes to see him anymore. Look out for yourself is what he says. It's the best friend you got. - I'm your friend, honest. - [Ratface] Well, guess we got the last drag outta that. How would you like it? - [Sullivan] Swell. (dramatic music) - I have traveled many moons to come here to tell you the legend of Running Deer. He was mighty brave warrior who died on this very place! I come to receive his signal so that his spirit may rest in peace! - [Ratface] I ain't scared of all this Indian stuff. (Ryan chanting) Aye yi yi ya! - Send me a sign, oh, Running Deer! (campers gasp) - He's out of his friggin' mind! - Do not be afraid, my braves. (Ryan howls) - The guy does a terrific job of gettin' these kids all worked up, don't you think? - He's a good little actor, Arnold. - I am possessed by the soul of Running Deer. He cries out to magic medicine men to bring him back to look once more upon his enemies who killed him so that he may slit them limb from limb and tear out their hearts for causing him so much pain! (counselors chanting) This is the only way his soul may rest in peace. Uh! (campers gasp) - There be only one among you magic medicine men who is brave enough to communicate with the spirit of Running Deer. His name be Ratface. - [Campers] Ratface, Ratface, Ratface! - He come with me. - Ratface, Ratface, Ratface! - Aw, this is stupid! - Ratface, Ratface, Ratface, Ratface, Ratface, Ratface, Ratface. - Oh, this is just a bunch of baloney! - [Campers] Ratface, Ratface, Ratface! (dark music) - Ooh! Ooh! (Ratface screams) - Come on, you guys, lemme out! - Ratface, it's me! - How did you do that thing with the fire? - Come over here, I'll show ya. Curses, potions, spells, all that stuff. You are swami, the medicine man, healer of arrow wounds, procurer of rain, friend of running Deer. - [Ratface] Gom! Gom de gom! - You cook magic spells and fill the air with magic smoke! You will avenge Running Deer's enemies! - Gom de gom gom. - Go to it, Ratface. They're waitin' for ya. Go scare the livin' daylights out of 'em. (howls) (campers screaming) - And crawl forward. Good, that's good. Head down, Knuckles. Head down, Bobby. Okay, that's enough! Into a circle. Come on, let's go, let's go, let's go! Okay, now when Ryan comes, he's Running Deer. You gotta show him some respect. We wanna win that prize for Big Chief's Indian program on pageant day. - You sure this is okay? - I used to it all the time when I was drivin' the ice wagon. It's just horse sense. Ha. (horse whinnies) - [Campers] Woo woo woo woo. (light music) - I thought he was supposed to stop. (horse whinnies) - Easy boy, whoa. Hi, Babe. Whoa, whoa! Whoa! - Whoa, Nicky. - Whoa, Nicky! - Here comes Running Deer again. - Hey, Babe! - Put your hands over his eyes. - What? - [Sullivan] Cover his eyes! (campers laughing) - How'd you know to do that? - Wouldn't you stop running if someone covered your eyes? - You jackass, Delaney, you nearly broke my arm! (campers laughing) You ride a horse like you paddle a canoe, Delaney. (diners muttering) - That's not bad, but I expect to see it even quicker next time. Hand goes up, jaw goes with it. All right, we have a birthday today. As is customary at Hochelaga, I'd like you all to take a moment to recognize him. Would Theodore Kowolski come forward, please? - [Campers] Ratface, Ratface, Ratface. - Happy birthday, Theodore! - [All] Ratface, Ratface, Ratface, Ratface! Ratface, Ratface, Ratface - Here you go, Ratface. Cut the cake. - [All] Ratface, Ratface, Ratface, Ratface, Ratface! - Well, I guess you can never really peg some guys. I always figured Ratface was a lost cause. - I guess that's why, Mo. A lotta people dumped on him. - Hey, the chief wants to see ya in his office right away. - I'll do it. - Thanks. - Here, Moose, hold the ladder. And don't wiggle it. Just my luck, I'll wreck my other arm. - Yeah, Chief, what is it? - Oh, it's about Ratface. - Listen, Chief, he's really improved. He's participating, and he really pulls his own weight. I really think - No, no. - he's gonna be fine. - No, no. Not that. I just got a call. His father died. - What are we gonna do, Chief? - Tell Babe to have him pack his things. They want him at home, so put him on the afternoon bus. - Lemme speak to him, will ya, Chief? - All right. - Not bad, Ratface. - If you came to crab at me about not being at wood craft, well, I'm sick of it. All we do is sandpaper the damn totem pole. - Listen, Ratface, why don't you sit down here for a minute? Hey, I know we've had our differences, you and me, but I want you to know you've improved, a helluva lot. - Maybe it's you who've improved. - Maybe. Didn't really think about it that way. - You were pretty pukey. (somber music) - Ratface, I, I got somethin' to tell ya about your pop. - Somethin' bad, right? He's dead, ain't he? - Yeah, he is. - Aw, hell! And I wasn't even there. When I told him goodbye, it was one of those days he didn't even know who I was. - You gotta try and remember the good things, the good times, Ratface. - Good times? What the hell are you talkin' about? Have you ever seen anybody gassed? He'd go for days and everything'd be okay, and all of a sudden, he'd turn crazy. Punchin' me and hollerin' crazy things and knockin' over stuff. And when it was over, when it was over, he'd sit down and cry like he was three years old. I wished I coulda seen what he was before, just once. My ma says he was the strongest man she ever knew. What am I gonna do now? - [Driver] Ratface, let's go! We gotta catch the six o'clock bus! - Ratface, when we get back, me and Ryan would like to see ya. - I won't be around. - Where you goin'? - I don't know, somewheres. - What about your ma? - She won't give a damn. Most of the time, she don't even talk to me. - I betcha things would be different now. - Nah. I'll go back and bury my pop. Maybe take off somewheres. Take it easy, wienie head. (melancholy music) - When we get back, Ratface, I'll be lookin' for ya. See ya, Ratface. (Blanche humming) - Shirt, skirt. God, brassiere! Panties, pink. Panties, beige. This is gonna be good. I think she's doing this 'cause she knows that I'm watching. - Shut up, Trimble! She has a boyfriend from Toronto. He's been here the past three weekends. - Haven't you seen the way she looks at me in the cafeteria lineup? She's tryin' to tell me something. Stockings! Stockings. She doesn't need stockings in camp. This is like a very private display just for me. This is a message! I gotta act. - You wouldn't know how to act if it was right there in front of ya. (horn blows) - Sorry, sorry. I'll put it away, and you won't see it again. Away it goes. There we go. It's gone. - Come on, corny, we'll go see old Blanche. You can tell her you got a headache or something. - [Myron] I don't have a headache. - Mo, some dame brought this for ya! - Thanks, Moose. - Go have dinner. - Okay. - I don't believe this! Look at this! Remember that girl I told you about, Gretta? - I thought you two had a fight. - She's at Pin Oaks, right across the lake! She must be tryin' to make up. Now, I'm gonna go up, sneak a phone call, and you can paddle me over. - No! - I gotta bring her somethin'. She likes to eat. Gotta be some decent food around her someplace. Trimble's a chocolate fanatic, ain't he? Bingo, the mother lode! Look at this. - What is this? - The key to Gretta's heart. We'll mix it with some lemonade, and presto, change-o! (laughs) - [Ryan] If we're caught, you're gonna take the rap. (Mo laughs) - [Radio Announcer] Coming into this game, folks, Billy Herman has had a 10-game hitting streak going. And the two and one pitch. (bat striking) (crowd cheers) - A home run, woo! - Deep to left center. It's going, it's going. - Sorry. I got the heebie jeebies, I guess. - Will you quit worryin'. Cripes! I bet you never even kissed a girl before! - How the hell do you know what I've done! - Don't be sore. It's that innocent altar boy face of yours. - [Radio Announcer] A two-run homer puts the Cubs up four to two. Now, it's Stan Hack up with two men out. His pitch is on the way. It's a ball, outside. (crowd cheering) - Shh, quiet! Come on. Whoa, whoa. This is my friend, Connie Firestone. - Hi. - Pleased to meet you. - [Mo] Oh, this is Ryan. He's the head counselor at our section. - [Gretta] We brought a little snack. - So did we. Ryan here's our number one Injun man. He's got the best Indian ghost stories you ever heard. - I absolutely adore Indian ghost stories. (laughs) - Gretta, we got a couple things we ought to catch up on. Why don't you two make yourselves comfortable? - Watch out for the poison ivy. It's all along the shore. - Don't worry. I'd recognize poison ivy anywhere. So, Gretta, how you been? - [Gretta] Morley, quit that! God, not now. (laughs) Stop. - Where do you go to school? - Uh, U of T, pre-law. - I'm a sophomore from McGill. Are you from Toronto? - Uh huh. (laughs) What about you? - (laughs) You've probably never even heard where I'm from. Chilakoat. - Why, I've been to Chilakoat. - You haven't! - I went there once when my father had his jewelry line. I carried his samples for him. - What did you think of it? - Prettiest Main Street I ever saw. - Imagine, you having been to Chilakoat. Will you ever be through there again? - No. My dad passed away five years ago. - Oh. - Well, maybe, you never know. (both laugh) - Do you have a girl back home? - No. - How come? - Wanted to keep the summer to myself. - I know what you mean. I cut off all my tangling alliances too. It's chillier here by the water than I thought. I should've brought my jacket. Oh, I barely know you. But it does feel warmer. Thanks. That lemonade has quite a kick. - You have a marvelous laugh. (both laugh) - [Mo] Come on! Let's go! - Young man. - Run. - Young man, come back. - Run, Connie! - What's going on? - I want to see who you are. Connie Firestone, get back here. Don't you run away. - [Mo] Wake up and paddle. My arms are killin' me. (light music) - [Ryan] What is going on? (laughs) - [Mo] Hey, old buddy, you get to first base with that Connie? - [Ryan] I don't think so. Oh, God, Mo, I feel sick. (both laugh) Oh, be careful. Don't rock the boat so much. Where's my paddle? (bell rings) - This is where I step out. You're on your own now. - Thanks, Mo. (bell rings) - For heaven's sake. Ryan Delaney, what in the name of heaven is wrong with you? - I feel sick. - Well, what have you been eating? Lemme feel your stomach. (sniffs) Plain drunk! (hand slaps) You just got what you deserve for being so stupid! You're lucky you didn't poison yourself you silly goof. (lively trumpet music) (Ryan groans) (bell ringing) - Oh, God. - Ryan, wake up. Are you waked up? (Ryan groans) How do you feel? - Like death. My insides have turned to plaster of Paris. - No, Ryan, I'm countin' on you. You can't die. - Hey, I don't mean really die. I just feel lousy. - Blanche said you had toenail poisoning from rotten food. - She said that? Blanche? - Yeah. - Oh, she musta meant ptomaine poisoning. - When I heard them say poison, I was afraid you were gonna croak, like Babe almost did when the snake bit him. - Nah, not me. (gentle music) What are you doing? Quit it! What's that in your pocket? - Aunt Bridget sent me a birthday card. - Oh, Sull, I didn't know it was your birthday. When was it? - Tomorrow. - No guff. Guess I better get Floyd to make you a cake, eh? Chief hates to miss a birthday. - Do you think Ma forgot? She never sent nothing yet. - Nah, she didn't forget. It probably just got stuck in the mail. - Yeah. Do you think Floyd will write my name on the cake, sorta like he did for Ratface? - I'll ask him for ya. - Promise you won't forget? - Cross my heart and hope to die. - Quit talkin' about dyin', will ya? - It's an expression, Sull. Don't be so stupid. - Well, I never know when you're tellin' the truth. - I promise I'll ask Floyd. - Swell, thanks a lot. I gotta go or I'm gonna miss my wrestling match. Mo's gonna make me number two on the fly wheel ladder. (Ryan groans) - You look like yesterday's scrambled eggs. - Uh, I'm fine. Listen, Floyd, did you get a notice from the office that it was my little brother's birthday tomorrow? - [Floyd] Yeah, Sullivan Delaney. - Do me a favor, will ya? Make him somethin' really special. I don't think he's ever had much of a birthday before. - What? - Well, he's never lived at home since he was real little. My ma couldn't afford much, and I don't think my relatives really bothered. I know it means a lot to him. - I'll make him a cake he'll never forget. - You're aces, Floyd. Thanks a lot. - See that tree at sunset rock? - What? - The maple. It's got red leaves on it. - Yeah, it's just one tree. There's still plenty of summer left. - Yeah well, once one goes, you know the rest ain't far behind. Pretty soon, the water'll get cold. It'll start raining. All this stuff'll get put away, and then you can kiss the summer of 1935 goodbye. - Well, it doesn't matter to me. I'm goin' to university. - Delaney! I wanna speak with you on the double! - What is it, Chief? - Give me one good reason why I shouldn't have you kicked outta this camp. - Chief? What do you mean? - Blanche has got her nerve covering for you. Ptomaine poisoning! Rose McMartin tells me she caught you and one of her counselors drinking last night over at Pin Oaks! A Miss Gretta Conley? - Well, that's not exactly true. I wasn't- - Don't bother tryin' to lie your way outta this, Delaney! The girl confessed everything. I am thoroughly embarrassed and disappointed. Obviously, I was mistaken in my estimation of you. You've not only let me down, you've tarnished the reputation of this entire camp! - But, sir, I- - You're lucky Miss McMartin has decided to let this incident pass. Let me tell you, though, I'm going to think long and hard about what disciplinary action this requires. I'm gonna make an example of you, Delaney. You're dismissed! - But, Chief- - You are dismissed! (door slams) - [Ryan] What happened to you? - I got a case of poison ivy so bad I can hardly blink my eyes. Gretta got a fever of 103. - I don't care if Gretta drops dead! That two-bit scrag squealed and blamed the whole thing on me. What a pig. - So, uh, what did you tell the chief? - Nothing. - You didn't say anything about me? - No point both of us gettin' canned. - Hey, you're the tops. I picked these up for you. - From Connie? - Nah, they ain't from Connie. - Hey, Ma remembered Sull's birthday. It's gonna make his summer. (tense music) - What's wrong? - Nothing. - You ain't sick again? - No. I'm okay, honest. - Hey, come on back, Ryan. What's wrong? - See how his head comes out of the water? See it? See his arm comin' out? Look at me when I'm talkin'. - Hi. - Where'd you get those? - Miss Gibson lent them to me for my test. I passed in the tide pool! I can swim, I can do the dog paddle. Do you wanna see me? Come on, Ryan. We'll go over to the gym room. No one will see us. I'll teach you the dead man floats and the jellyfish floats- - Bug off! I'll do the dead man's float when I'm dead. (sad music) - What's the matter, Ryan? - I lost the scholarship. Not enough funds for this year. Told me to reapply next year. Fat lotta good that'll do. (crying) (gentle music) - [Sullivan] Miss Gibson, are ya home? (hand knocking) - Uh, I'm sorry I'm late for the campfire, Chief. I'm heading over to the longhouse right away. - Sullivan tells me you have had a considerable disappointment. - Sullivan doesn't know what he's talkin' about. - He told me everything. - What do you mean? - Everything, that you're only 16, and- - Listen, I can explain everything, Miss Gibson. Why don't you get lost, Sullivan, before I break your neck? - I've seriously considered letting you go, Delaney- - But, Chief, I think he did a heck of a job for bein' 16. Like I said, he don't even know Gretta. I made him come- - Pipe down, Brennan! Neither of you had any business bein' over at that camp. That aside, Delaney, no need to cover for him. If you told me the truth, I'd've believed ya. - I'd like to make you an offer, a loan, the equivalent to the full value of your scholarship. You can pay me back out of your future earnings. But on one condition. You and Sullivan must promise to return to this camp for at least the next two summers. - I just don't know what to say. - Do you want some time to think about it? (gentle music) - I didn't even think you liked me. What are you people doing this for? - Sullivan is a very convincing boy. And we think you deserve to go to university. (bell ringing) - Hey, Floyd. This is it! Today's my day. - Get outta here, kid! (campers whooping) - All right. Well, as is our tradition, we have another birthday to celebrate today, Sullivan Delaney, in Indian Mound Village, hits the big number 10! Three cheers for Sullivan. Hip, hip. - [All] Hooray! - [Chief] Hip, hip. - [All] Hooray! - [Chief] Hip, hip. - [All] Hooray! - Congratulations, Sullivan. Here's a little something from all of us. - [Campers] Sully, Sully, Sully - Hey, Sully. - Sully, Sully, Sully, Sully! - Happy birthday, Sully. Here, cut it right down the middle there. Give it a good cut. I musta forgot to sharpen it. Try cuttin' around the edge. - It's cardboard! The cake's made outta cardboard! (all laugh) (tense music) - Hey, Sully, stop. I got the real cake. I guess he can't take a joke, can he? - Sullivan? Scram! (sad music) You here? Sullivan! - Sully! - Sullivan! - Sully! - Sully! - [Ryan] Sullivan! - [Counselor] Sullivan! - Sull! - Here's a detailed description of what he looks like. - Sull! - Um hmm. - We appreciate your help, Officer. - [Mo] Hey, Sully! - I'll circulate this to the local radio stations and have them put out a bulletin. There's not much more we can do tonight. - Thank you, good night. - Sully, where are ya? - [Man] Sullivan! - Hey, go get some sleep. - It just doesn't make sense why he'd run away and not come back, Mo. - What did you expect? You stood there and laughed like the rest of them. - Sull! - He probably figures you set him up. - Sull! (sad music) - Come on. We'll try again in the morning. - [Counselor] Sullivan! (light music) - Sullivan! Sull! Sullivan! Sull! (man whistling) Excuse me. Have you seen a little boy about four feet tall? I'm lookin' for my 10-year-old brother. - As a matter of fact there was a policeman just here, oh, 20 minutes ago. He was buyin' crackers for some kid. - Was he from around here? - No, that's why I mention him. Never seen him before. Of course, lots of kids run away these days. Bill Harley has him over to the bus station. - Thanks. - Thanks a lot, Vince. - Sully! (sad music) - [Officer] Okay, Billy Roberts, you've given your parents quite a scare. Your mother's worried sick about ya. What the heck did you run away for anyway? - [Grace] Sullivan was so eager to learn, but he still wasn't a strong swimmer, Arnold. [Boy] Hey, Billy! They think they found something at the end of the dock! Maybe it's Sull! (bird squawks) (gentle music) - Hey. You okay? - I was thinkin' about runnin' away, but I didn't know where to go. - Floyd was just kidding. There was a real cake, you know. You just took off too quick. - You were laughin' at me. - It was just one of Floyd's stupid jokes. I didn't have anything to do with it, honest. - You're just like Ma. You don't care. - That's not true. Of course she does. - She never sent you away. - Sull, when Ma first got sick, I had to take care of myself. Lots a times, there wasn't even enough to eat. She sent you away because she was afraid she couldn't look after you. Of course she loves you. I won't ever let her send you away again. I promise. Wanna go home? You can go home if you want. - No. I wanna stay here with you. Don't ever leave me, huh, Ryan? - I'm not gonna leave ya, Sull. You're my brother. (gentle music)
