[SLOW JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC STOPS] [IMITATING TRUMPET] Good news, Kitty. December the 3rd, I'm due for a fresh sock and a quarter of Spam. It's good. It's a good book, this. [CHUCKLES] [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO] MAN ON RADIO: This is London. Here is a special announcement. Unconfirmed reports are coming in that German troops are carrying out large-scale maneuvers... Ah, it's you, son. Dad. The prime minister, Mr. Chamberlain, and... Neville Chamberlain's a fool! The man should step down for a better man. Why don't you write in for the job, Dad? I have. This moment I'm waiting for my dear king to write to me to ask me to form a new government. Hey, son, another of these "OHMS" letters arrived for you. Ohm! OHMS? Actually, that's just another cunningly worded invitation for me to partake in World War II. Just fancy, of all the people in England, they've chosen you. Oh, it's a great honor, son. You'll have to open one, son. I mean, we're running out of disguises. Dad, there will never be another war. Yes, there will. Never! Never! Yes, there will. We need them. Now listen, son. Don't you work too late tonight. And don't blow too hard. It's not good for the heart and it can cause hernia. Good night, Mum. Night, Dad. Night, son. It's a good title for a song. Good night, Mum, good night, Dad. And Auntie. Depends upon how big the family is, I suppose. Just in time, Harry. In time for what? In time for me to open the door for you. [LAUGHS SARCASTICALLY]Very funny. I knew you'd like it. Is that Dad in there? No, that's your granny doing impressions. Good night to you, too. And good night to you, too.

Oh, I'll make up for it, sir. I'll fight nights as well. Silence! Why is he still in civilian clothes? They wouldn't let me on the train naked. Silence! I mean, Milligan, why aren't you in uniform? Because I'm not at war with anybody, sir. They really should arrest these recruiting officers. Milligan, we have to try to turn you into a soldier. Yes, sir. That imposes a very heavy burden on us. Would it be better if I went back home, sir? You're in for the duration, and it starts now. Silence! I didn't say anything! Beg your pardon, sir. See that he's taken care of, Sergeant. Sir! Come on! Get them shoulders back! Left, right, left, right, left, right! And take that bloody smile off your face! Attention! What's this, then? What's this? Feeling mutinous, are we? Squad, attention!

Wait for it! Squad, dismissed! [ALL CHATTERING] Yeah, the rustics. You remember that. In the year 1940 A.D., Gunner Terence Alan Milligan invaded the British army. Armies fled in terror when Milligan unleashed his diabolical secret weapon, the standard British battle dress. Now, note the extra-long sleeves for dipping in soup. Note the extra-wide collars. This lets in the wind, snow, and more soup. Soup and wind gets up here, and the folds in the trousers are for collecting more soup, thereby making Milligan the indisputable soup plan. [BLOWS TUNELESSLY ON TRUMPET] Leave off! They reek! They smell of cow dung. That's the bulletproofing you smell. Yeah, bulletproofing, my tits. I know cow dung when I smell it. Put it on, William. I think you'll look absolutely... Very good. Knock it off! Go on, feel it. It's as rough as old iron. You're right. They're not fit for human habitation. [PLAYS FAST TUNE] Hey, you can really play that thing. What experience have you had? Well, there was Irma at 16, Carol and Norma at 18, but after that it gets a bit... What he means is are you interested in joining a small group? Certainly, if you think I'm small enough. Great. I'm the manager. I'm delighted. Don't do that, you're making my eyes water. All right, sir? Sergeant? It's time to inspect the new lot, sir. Yes. Yes, of course. Lead on, Sergeant. What's the matter with you, Heavenly? Crushing your cobblers, are they? It's me feet. I keep telling them I've got flat feet, but they won't listen. Flat feet? Give over! It's true. I've got the papers. I've got hereditary flat feet. Don't you worry, Heavenly. You need flat feet. It's a flat world. The MO says you're okay. Yeah, well, I've got flat feet. We've all got flat feet. No, my condition is a medical fact. Hey, look, he doesn't believe me. A tenner says that I have got flat feet. All right? All right. Well, you'll have to prove it, Spike. I've thought of that. What about a flat foot print? Will that do? I don't know what you mean. Show him. Yeah, go on, Spike. All right. Would you get me a piece of cardboard, please, Bill? Anything for a mate, Spike. May I borrow your Brylcreem, please? Certainly, Spike. What's the cardboard for? Look, you asked for proof. Now, please, pay attention. All right. Attention. Yes, all right. Are you watching, Heavenly? I'm watching. Look. Is the bet still on? Yeah.Shake. Sorry about that. Right, now watch. Is that or is that not a flat footprint? Of course it is. Flat as a pancake. Definitely flat. It's flat because of your weight, isn't it? All right, then we'll do it another way. Stand back, lads. Oh, could you get me your pillow? Same as usual, sir, I'm afraid.Yeah. There's one who's a bit of a troublemaker. Milligan, sir. There's always one. Now, smear both me soles with that stuff, Bill. Certainly. Lovely. Is the bet still on, Heavenly? Yes.Shake. Sorry about that. Now put the cardboard on the top. Lovely. You're a very difficult man to convince, Heavenly. Now press down. Hard. Attention. Attention! Milligan, if it's not too much trouble, care to explain? I'm just practicing, sir. Practicing? Yes, sir. In case we're all sent to Australia, sir. [MEN LAUGHING] Are you now? Did you hear that, Sergeant? Yes, sir. On your feet, twit. You're speaking to an officer. There's something not quite right about this man, sir. Why aren't you in uniform? Uniform, Sergeant? They're dangerous. Dangerous? Why? Well, Germans shoot at them, sir. [MEN LAUGHING] I think he's all right, Sergeant. Just has a healthy fear of being shot at. Well, we'll have to put you somewhere where they can't find you, won't we? Thank you, sir. Cookhouse fatigue, 0600 hours in the morning. Yes, sir. Right, carry on. Carry on, men. [BLOWS RASPBERRY] [BUGLE PLAYING] [BUBBLING] Bye, darling. Morning, sir.Morning. You're up early.

Get out. Come on, hurry it up. Get on with it. MAN: Oh, leave off. [ALL COUGHING] That's it, lads. Go on, cough it up. It might be a gold watch. Where are we, Sarge? That's a good question, Neal. You're probably wondering why I brought you out here this morning. You're a nature lover, Sarge. Not your nature, Milligan. Full of honest concern for your physical wellbeing, me and the OC have decided that there's gonna be no PT this morning. [ALL CHEERING] He's human, after all! Heart of gold. Yes. Instead you'll all be pleased to hear we've decided you need something a bit more strenuous. [ALL GROANING] Now, for starters, we've decided to send you on a little run. A five-mile run. What? Five bleeding miles? What about my feet? Right. Off you go. Come on, get on with it. All right, you lot, get on with it! Move, Milligan! Come on, hup, two, three! Pick those legs up. You've got five miles to go, you know. Go on, get on with it! # Once in a while you've a feeling that somebody hates you # Run for a mile, get a feeling for old Mother Nature # But looking on the sunny side # At least I think I might survive # Better men than me have died # All to keep the war alive # It's gonna be a good, good war # It's gonna last a month or more # Lots of lovely things in store # For you and me # And when the fighting's done Only another four and a half miles to go! # It's gonna be such good clean fun # Wait and see # Once in a while you can smile at the stories they told you # Write to your mum, tell her isn't it fun playing soldiers # And though he makes the odd remark # Sergeant says I look the part # There's nothing to this army lark # But I wonder when the real thing starts # It's gonna be a good, good war # It's gonna last a month or more # Lots of lovely things in store # For you and me # And when the fighting's done # At least I'll know that I could run # It's gonna be such good clean fun # Wait and see # La-la-la-la-la-da-da # Da-da-da-da-la-da-da # Da-da-da-da-da-da-da [PANTING] [EXCLAIMS] Milligan!

We got a gig, Spike. Yeah. How much? Leave that to me. I'm the manager, ain't I? Well, in that case, you can manage another beer. # There were four and twenty virgins down from Inverness # And when the ball was over there were four and twenty less # Let's turn it off, you lot! All right, who said that? Stand up and step outside. It's like Paddington Station in here. Can't a man get no privacy? [BLOWS RASPBERRY] Who said that? Him. Why don't you lot push off back to your own hut and let a hero get some kip? Hey, lads, lads, lads, come here. Do you wanna see something? What? Now, what you got? Hey, sure, come on, give the lad a chance. Listen. Now, I want no lights. No lights, please. Give that man no lights, please. Don't do that, I've got a full house!

Will you shine that torch just down there? That's it. Now, I'd like to kick off with a parade of army life. [ALL HUM] Turn your minds to that lovely and beautiful thing, the army breakfast. You know what I mean, lads? You go in to the canteen, up to the cook, and what do you get? Sausage on a plate. [IMITATING TRUMPET] # Sausage on a plate! Now. Now. Note the contrast with a boiled-potato effect. Now, moving on, moving on, here are some familiar objects, for your pleasure. # Pleasure! We're passing the quartermaster's store. And there's a squaddie on jankers. And what is he doing? He's carrying something. And what is he carrying? A sack of flour. # Sack of flour! [ALL CHEERING] Thank you, thank you. And now, please, settle down. I would like to do for you an impression. My impression of Groucho Marx.

[SOLDIERS LAUGHING] Stop laughing! You lot have got about as much chance of learning to drive as I have of becoming the prime minister. But the army says you've got to drive, so drive you bleeding well will. Got the message? MEN: Yes, Sarge. Right. Now, then, this vehicle should be like a human being and must be treated like one. For a start, it must be fed the right ingredients. These are petrol, oil and water. That's what we had for breakfast, Sarge. [ALL LAUGHING] Each one has its own hole for pouring. And if we put the wrong thing into the wrong hole, just as if I put my boot in your hole, Milligan, it ceases to function. There's no need for blasphemy, Sarge. I hope you know a few hymns. Because you're next. Leave it to me, Sarge. [DOOR SLAMS] [GEARS GRINDING] [HONKS] Put that hooter back! Milligan! For God's sake, put your right out. Get back on the... Milligan. Milligan.

I'll go and get one. Milligan! Get changed. Oh, no, look, please, Sarge. Look, I... Don't worry, lad. He's only little. Only little. Well, how little? Oh, very little. He's almost a dwarf. A big dwarf or a small dwarf? [STUTTERING] Oh, go on, Spike, you can do it. There's no need to worry about it. It's an order. Please, Sarge. Get off. Watkins, help him. Sarge! Oh, no, please, Sarge... [ALL CHEERING] All right. Not too hard. He'll punch you before he goes in. What's the matter with you? Please would you stop? I'm not ready. Come on, don't muck about. Please, I'm gonna bloody... But I'm not gonna do it! I am not going... Milligan, come on. Bill, this is all your fault! Come on. Bill... Help! Help! Help. That's not our man. A substitute? Use your hands on him, not your teeth. [EXCLAIMS] My God! What did you say about science, Jack? Milligan, the regiment's watching you. I'm gonna join my regiment. Milligan! Look, Sarge, I am not fighting that till I've heard it talk. Don't let appearances fool you. They haven't. They haven't. Don't worry, Spike. You can do it. You sure I can do it? Yes, you can do it. Here. Have a drink. All right? Don't do that, please. Now, then. I want a clean fight. And when I say "break," break! Now, then, go to your corners, come out on the bell. Right? Right.Right. Seconds out. Round one! [ALL CLAMORING] [INAUDIBLE] [INAUDIBLE] [ALL GRUMBLING] [BELL RINGING] [SHOUTING] You dirty slop pan! You hit Stewie in the groonies! Your man doesn't fight fair, does he? It's the excitement, Colin. Wally.Yes. Give us a rifle. I'll kill him. Seconds out. Round two! Use Big Bertha. [ALL BOOING] ALL: One! Two! Three! Four! [ALL CHEERING] Kill him, Spike! Kill him! [ALL BOOING] [EXCLAIMS] I think my lad has the edge. Two bottles of Scotch Mist say he hasn't. You're on. Let him come to you! Let him come to you! [GRUNTING] Just keep away, all right? Keep away. I think he's out in front now. Just stay, stay, stay away from, from... Keep away! Seconds out. Third and final round. MAN: What? Get it? Stay away from him. Come on, Stewart, you've not hit him yet. You've not hit him! One, two, three... I think I'd better throw the bloody towel in. He'll bloody kill him! [ALL GROAN IN DISAPPOINTMENT] [ALL CHEERING] [ALL COUNTING] [ALL CHEERING] SERGEANT: Right, on you come. Easy, lads. You're not on a bloody trapeze. Three or four goes of this, and you'll know what a knee-trembler really means. That'll teach you not to muck around with those little birdies behind the Naafi, Watkins. SOLDIER: Watch out. Come on. Come on, lads. Get up, lads. Who's driving that bloody mess tin? Good. Excellent. Shall I get them down, sir? No, no, no. Leave them where they are. Mustn't interfere too much, you know. Men, you are now approaching the final phase of your training. Up to now you may have thought that there was no more to soldiering than PT, parades, and inspections. Nothing could be more wrong, believe me. As you know, our Scottish colleagues, the Second Highlanders, a regular regiment, are imparting the final lick which will turn you into professional soldiers. British soldiers. And we, the officers of this regiment, know that when you finally take the field against the Germans, the skills we have taught you and the martial traditions of our race will transform you into an invincible opponent. So, men, tonight you sleep, and tomorrow you'll train and train and train again! Squad, attention! [ALL EXCLAIMING] A most satisfactory day, Sergeant. Thank you, sir. Yes, sir. Look out, Adolf. Here we come! [SCREAMING] [BARKING ORDERS] Move it! Let's have you, come on! He'll breathe on your glasses, laddie, and rape you. Come on, move it! Go on! In! Come on, lift your feet up! In! In! Move it! Let's have you! Come on! What's the matter with you, Milligan? That's a filthy German you've got there. Now stab him. That's my manny. In. Out. Cut. Rip. Slash. Kill. Kill. Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! [SPIKE PANTING] Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill. Kill. Kill. Kill. Kill. Don't worry. It's just good clean fun. Right. Now, I know all you lads fancy yourselves as wee Tarzans, so we've devised this little exercise to pander to you. I want each of you to get on yon platform, grab the rope, swing across, and send the rope back. You understand? ALL: Yes, Sarge. I hope so, lads, because beyond the innocent-looking bushes are really vicious stinging nettles and bum-piercing thistles to keep you aloft. You understand now? ALL: Yes. Right, then! You, Milligan, Neal, you're first. After me. Right. I'll go first, send the rope back for each of you. Do you ken? [SCREAMS] [LAUGHS] Right! Right, laddie. [BOTH SHOUTING] SPIKE: Me goolies! SERGEANT: Three of us... [RIPPING] Where's me kilt? Where's me kilt? Mother! You bloody English fools! Well, men, a significant landmark has just been passed. Your training has been successfully concluded. As from today, you may consider yourselves as fully trained British soldiers. However, there is one last item on our agenda. In order that you may try out your new skills, we intend to give you a test. Oh, God! Not another one. I'll just put you in the picture. Here is our secret HQ, in red. It is in fact a tent, the location of which is known only to myself and the staff. Here is the enemy's HQ, in blue, also secret. Our mission is to seek this out and destroy it. Their job is to try and stop us. [SPIKE IMITATING TRUMPET] Turn left at the next turning. Can you see anything, Larry? No. Nothing. Yet. What about your side, Pongo? There's no left turn on this side either. Are you sure we're going the right way? Leave it to me, mate. Our first checkpoint should be coming up soon. [EXCLAIMS] Turn left. We should have heard from them by now. SPIKE ON RADIO: Calling Sunray. Calling Sunray. I think they're coming through now, sir. This is Seagull. Over. Seagull, sir. Jolly good. We have reached our first objective, sir. Over. Very good work, Seagull. Now, according to your map, you should be on the top of a hill, looking down into a beautiful green valley. Now, move on to point two, which you'll find somewhere in grid reference 24. And remember, Blue Rover is on the lookout for you, so use your initiative at all times. Over and out. [IMITATING TRUMPET] What are we looking for now? We're looking for a bridge. A small bridge made of wood. But first... What? We're lost. [ALL CLAMORING] [TIRES SCREECHING] What are you going backwards for? Forward! I know! There! There! [ALL SHOUTING] They went that way! Where are we going? According to my calculations, the main road is straight ahead. Well, what's happened to the bleeding road then? There's a war on. They need the concrete. Push! [INAUDIBLE] Push! [ALL JEERING] Any sign of them? I think we're clear. Where are we now? If we stick to this road, we will reach that bridge. Are you sure? Leave it to me, mate. They'll never find us now. [WHISTLING] Hey, they're behind us! They're coming now! Right. Let's get out of here. [WHISTLING] [WHISTLING] [WHISTLING] [WHISTLING] [GIGGLING] Sunray, Sunray, come in. This is Seagull. Sunray, Sunray, this is Seagull. Over. Sunray, calling Sunray, this is Seagull. Sir, Seagull's coming through. Sunray, Sunray, this is Seagull. There you are, Tony. Told you they'd do it. Over. Seagull? This is Sunray. Give us your position. Over. We have located Blue Rover's nest. I repeat, Blue Rover's nest. Over. Have you, by God? Do you hear that? They've run enemy HQ to earth. This is very good work indeed, Seagull. Stand by to receive attack instructions. Unload the crates. And inside them, you'll find bags of liquid. Now, these are your bombs. Plenty for each of you. You're to advance and bombard the area with these stain bombs. BOTH: Yes, sir. And use your bayonets to destroy the tent. And finally... ALL: Yes, sir? ...you will find blankets and cords for your hostages. [STUTTERING] Hostages, sir? You're to capture all personnel present and report to the referee in the main camp. Good luck. You've performed absolutely brilliantly so far. Over and out. Well, sir, we did it. The men, Tony. Never forget the men. Our leadership, but their initiative. Yes, sir. [SIGHS] Well, they've got a lovely day for it. [SOLDIERS CHEERING] Charge! [ALL SINGING] [SOLDIERS GROANING] Oh, God. Come on, push. Well, it won't be long now before we see the fruits of your labors. I'm afraid some of my seed may have fallen on stony ground, sir. That was a bit careless, was it not? What I mean, sir, is the raw material was a bit wanting. Only to be expected. They're English, aren't they? [DISTANT SINGING] [ALL CHEERING] Enemy camp destroyed, sir. Well done, Milligan. We'd almost given you up. And who are they? That's the enemy commander and staff, sir. Is that so, now? Sir. I am the enemy commander. You are the enemy commander, sir? That I am. [LAUGHS] I mean, you can't... You are the enemy commander, sir. Yes. Well, sir, there is someone going round impersonating you. Oh? Come with me. Get him undone! Milligan! On your feet. My socks... Up! Good morning, sir. Have you got everything you want? Oh, no, sir, no. I haven't got a Bentley. Silence! Who is that? He's my father, sir. He's a funny man. Well, he'll have to go. Well, yes, sir. Where would you like him to go? I think he'd look lovely on a piano. Put him out of my sight. It's not allowed. Do you hear? Pardon? Do you hear? Hear what, sir? Look, I'm not having any private being a smart aleck at my expense. No, no, sir. No expense. I did it free. Put this man under arrest, will you? But he is, sir. He is under arrest. Consider yourself lucky, Milligan. Tomorrow is your last day here. Your regiment is being posted abroad, and you have been granted home leave. Thank you, sir. And you, madam. Whatever you do, Sarge, please don't slam the door. Hello, Mum. Son! [AIR-RAID SIREN WAILING] Look at you. Well? You've changed. Well, just me vest. I didn't go mad. Who is it, Kitty? Wait and see, Dad. Now, mother, what's that... Hello, Captain. Terence! Welcome home, dear lad. Welcome home. Nice to see you. How's the war going? All right? The war is going... [IMITATES MACHINE GUN FIRE] ...and "bang"! Right. Well, we're going to dine in style tonight, at Le Hotel Anderson. He means the shelter.Yeah. Yes, sir. Have you got my headscarf, Mother? I haven't got my wig on. Oh, yes, dear, yes. [BOMBING] Yes, I must've mislaid the key. I'm sorry about that. They say there's another secret passage here... What do they do? Well, what they do is what they do. Bless us, oh, Lord, and these, thy gifts, which we're about to receive, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen. Name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost. Amen. Pass the salt, Dad. There isn't any, son. The convoy went down. Nevertheless, you can partake of this frugal meal flown from the four corners of the Empire by His Majesty's Air Force. God bless the man. Makes you feel good to be British, Mum. I do hope they're feeding you well, son. Yeah. Yeah. Of course they are. Of course they are. Really? There's plenty more of these lease-lend eggplant if you want it. Could I have more tea, Mum, please? How do you take your tea these days, son? Wartime strength, Dad. [BOMBING STOPS] They've stopped bombing. Even the Germans have to eat sometimes. I've got a surprise for you, Terence. Chateau Liversan, 1934. He won it in a raffle. Yeah. It's at shelter temperature. Thanks, Dad. Now, remember, we've always been a close family, never been parted before. Anyhow, let's hope that after this war we're still together, and happy, and in one piece. Till it's over, then, let's drink a toast to the family, to the Milligans. [EXPLOSION] By God, that's great stuff. Run out and buy another raffle ticket. Dad, don't move. Give us a handkerchief, Mum. Don't move? I have no interest in moving. The rent here is cheap. Just hold that there. I'll get some cotton wool. [ALARM BELL CLANGING SOFTLY] Good heavens. Good heavens. [ALL SINGING] [ALL CHEERING] Have one on me, sir! Up yours, Milligan! See you later, sir! Good luck, dear sir. And all who sail in her, eh? Look out, Neville! She's not much, sir! She just lies there and chews the pillow! [ALL LAUGHING] Hello, doll! [PEOPLE CHATTERING] [INAUDIBLE] You are watching the time, sir? Oh, thank you very much, Sergeant. Yes, thank you. I'll just have a word with them before I go. I'll get them nice and quiet for you, sir. All right, could we have a bit of quiet, lads? Everyone! Nice and quiet, please. At the back. Nice and quiet. Major Drysdale would like to have a few words with you. Thank you, son. Gentlemen, thank you very much indeed for the drink. I'd just like to have a few words with you because it'll probably be the last opportunity I shall have. This regiment has an appointment with the Boche. And, as you know, the Royal Regiment always keeps its appointments. Yes! Yes, sir. No one's pretending that it's going to be an easy job. It isn't. But amongst the fighting men of the world, the British soldier is the finest. ALL: Yes, sir. Now, always remember that and the army will be proud of you. So far, men, Jerry has had it all his own way. But your turn has now come. Your cause is just, so have faith, gentlemen. Have faith in your God, trust your officers, and believe in the great traditions of your arms, and there can only be one result. Complete and total victory. Hear! Hear! Hear! Hear! It's your night, boys. Enjoy yourselves and don't do anything that I wouldn't have done at your age. [ALL CHEERING] # For he's a jolly good fellow # For he's a jolly good fellow # For he's a jolly good fellow # And so say all of us Well, here's to a good war, Jack. Oh, it will be, Colin. For some of us. [ALL CLAMORING] [ALL SINGING] [SLOW TRUMPET TUNE PLAYING] [INAUDIBLE] [SIGHS] All right, lads! Right down the front. Turn round the corner, then straight down to the end. Left, right, left. Left, right, left. [ALL SINGING] [BARKING ORDERS] Keep right back while the train comes in, all right? Right, make a nice, neat pile, lads. In here, come on. Nice neat pile. That's it. That's it. You know interchangeable, like, with each other. Come on! Let's go. It'll all be over. LARRY: You got your bucket and spade, Sarge? Hey, hey! You just watch it, you. [ALL CHATTERING] He's right. He's right. Listen. Listen to Pongo. Pongo knows. They're like that. Dovetails are like that. No, look, that's a crevice joint. Now, a crevice joint... Stand right back. Excuse me. Excuse me. Stop pushing, sir! [ALL CHATTERING] I'd like to say goodbye to her, you know, before we go. Oh, here she is! SOLDIER: This is Margaret! [ALL CHEERING] SOLDIER: Go on, sir. Give her some stick, sir. Go on! Go on! Go on! [ALL CHEERING] One more, sir. One more. Come on, one more. Do it again. Do it again. [ALL CHEERING] [TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWING] Right, men, keep away from the edge of the platform. [ALL CHATTERING] It's just like going to the seaside. This is the seaside, you fool. You know what I mean. [ALL CHEERING] Thank you very much. That's very... [WHISTLE BLOWS] We're on our way. Stop the train! It's driving me to death! Next stop, war. Get out of the way! Let's have a look, then. [ALL SINGING] MAN ON RADIO: This is the BBC Home Service. Here is the 7:00 a.m. news, and this is Alvar Lidell reading it.
