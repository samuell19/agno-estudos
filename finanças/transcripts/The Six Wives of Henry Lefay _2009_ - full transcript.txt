It's the age thing, isn't it? You can't seem to get past that, can you? No it's not that. I mean there is that But I'm worried about you Making plans, and ... - Barbie Forgive me for saying so, but ... I think I know him a little bit better Than you do at this point And with men of this type I mean sometimes You just have to catch them at the right age When they're finally ready to settle down In my heart Henry is a true romantic I know it sounds crazy but why do you think He's gotten married so many times He honestly believes there's such a thing As happily ever after Can I help you, miss? What do you think that kid could be thinking? Oh I know what he's thinking He's thinking "No one is ever Gonna have sex with me" You used to have that job - Mm hmm And you used to be that girl Right over there watching Is that what you were thinking? - Maybe Did you ever get married? - No Boyfriend - Yeah So uh what's the deal with you and Sarah Jane Wasn't expecting that How long have you guys been together? - No no no, she was just pulling your chain We're not together Anyway, I don't see where you got called to say anything After the way you broke my heart What do you mean the way I broke your heart? You dumped me After I heard about you and Johnny Ferrigno On the band trip Johnny Ferrigno ... I barely remember that I made out with him, didn't I?

Blue skies smiling at me ... - Aww Don't even think of trying to charm Your way out of this one Sarah Jane just likes to talk too much That's all She's a bitch on wheels okay Ever since high school She was a freshman I didn't invite her to some party I didn't even know what I did Just don't expect me to be nice to her Just give it time Everything has a way of working itself out No, things don't work themselves out What happens is You do what suits you at the moment And then you assume someone's gonna Come along and clean up your mess And someone always does Usually me Okay, come back inside I'll buy you one of those molten chocolate cakes A molten choc ...

This is gonna be a circus You have no idea Alright, I'll buy us some cotton candy We'll be fine Guess he wasn't too hung up On the whole PC fan, huh? Sweetheart Ohh baby ... Hi I'm Kate Lloyd ... It's a pleasure to meet you Yeah, you too I'm sorry it's not under happier circumstances How long has it been since you talked To your father? About a year When he tricked me into coming in last fall My condolences I'm sure this is uh ... Sure this is rough on you two I did all my crying over losing Henry Lefay a long time ago I won't be selfish about Henry's memory He spent the earlier stages of his life With several other women and I wanna make sure that they're Treated like family At the viewings And sitting upfront with us at the funeral That'll mean alot to my Mom And the others Alot of women Would be more jealous of his past I'm very secure in the journey that Henry and I shared together There's no point in troubling myself For the experience before we even met What is the granola queen Going on about now? Uhmm, Autumn is talking about Henry - Henry is dead, what is she saying? That they had a good marriage Just don't let her say any crystals - Oh, okay Are you hungry Mae, or thirsty? What? Can I get you something to eat or drink? Don't shout at me Get me some water Where's Henry? He's gone, Grandma He passed away I'm gonna get you that water Okay? I'm gonna grab that That's good What can i do to help with the arrangements? Cause I know Dad never thought He was ever gonna die So I'm sure there's alot of things That needs to be figured out It's all under control Henry made all the arrangements in advance It's one of the many ways your father changed In the time since you've known him I think that Henry's Spiritual quest was brought on in part by a sense That a transition might be coming He wrote me the most beautiful letter Outlining all the details of the funeral that he wanted Pallbearers, music, everything He even picked out a plot at Shady Glen Under a great white oak All of us someday beside him And really, the only problem is in getting The American Consulate in Mexico To help us get his body released And shipped up here but Veronica's taking care of that He's still in Mexico? Wait I mean I'm surprised that you would come back without him Oh I wasn't in Mexico with him You didn't know that? The trip was something that Henry had to do on his own Sort of a Spiritual retreat But between you and me There is something going on down there Some element of his quest That he didn't want me To know about I think he may have found Some sort of shaman Or maybe even started Experimenting with peyote Peyote my ass He was in Mexico screwing someone else And the bimbo ran him and left his body to rot Any suspects? Wife No. 2 Wife No. 4 Isn't that the same person? Welcome to the circus Hello ... Ophelia? It's Barbara Are you in here? Hello? Oh boy ... Barbie ... Oh my God You look just like him What's gonna happen to us, huh? Y'know I never stopped loving that man No matter who he was married to No matter who I must marry too It's okay ... And who is this ... Tall handsome prince That's my boyfriend Lloyd Lloyd, say hello to Ophelia ... Charmed Not half as much as I am Can I get you a glass of Cabernet, Lloyd? It's too bad you weren't in town last week You would've watched me star in A local production of 'Grease' I got to relive high school - I'm sure that was really something to see Well, maybe when this is all done I'll give you a little private sample Barbie ... We should talk about the funeral arrangements Actually aside from getting his body back Into the country Autumn has it all under control Daddy worked everything out in advance Right down to the burial plots Burial plots? No ... Henry wanted to be cremated Cotton candy time ... He wrote me this beautiful letter Specifying exactly how he wanted His funeral down to the smallest detail He didn't trust Autumn to do it right I'm sure No, Henry wanted to be cremated And have his ashes spread over the ocean From a catamaran Off the Bahamas You have this in writing? We once made love there I'm one of those Anyway talk to the other wives Ask Veronica She's on everyday I'm sure she knew he wanted to be cremated Lloyd ... - Yeah Have you ever experienced the pleasure Just inches away From a live barracuda? Uhmm ... Honey? Come inside Look, why don't you go downstairs And check out the new Ipods? Okay, but if there's gonna be a scion I wanna watch Please go, I'll be there in a few Veronica Hi ... I'm ... Grateful to have you in here In such a painful time Yeah ... Uh, you're taking this alot Harder than I expected Considering that you guys spent pretty much The last 10 years At each other's throats We remain business partners For so long because We were the best of friends Underneath V ... Can I ask you something? Did Daddy wanted to be cremated? No! Why would you think that? That's what Ophelia says Ophelia is a manipulative lunatic Henry wanted to be buried At Pleasant Meadows At Pleasant Meadows ... - Yeah Autumn said that they have plots together At Shady Glen We have plots side by side At Pleasant Meadows Henry wanted us to be buried Next to one another Y'know Autumn is his wife Please, nobody takes that seriously Si? [Speaking in Spanish] American Consulate in Mexico [Continues speaking in Spanish] A hah ... So, so you're trying to locate the woman Who'd been staying at the hotel with him Excellent [Speaking in Spanish] Adios Hah! They didn't want to release the body If the woman he was staying with Was still in Mexico But because they can't figure out Who the hell she is They decide to turn him Over to us He'll be in the contract tonight And at the Ithaca airport In the morning Okay ... this is good news I guess Yeah Good news That they're sending him back Awful news That he was down there with somebody I don't know if I'm ready To see your Dad in a casket You don't have to It's closed Closed? Well everyone Had a different opinion So I suggested that we close it At least for now I think it's barbaric That people wanna look at the body anyway Yeah, but he's been in an accident They wanna know he's okay Miss Lefay? I'm John Goodenough From the funeral home If there's anything we can do Please see me directly Thank you I did not have the privilege of knowing Your father personally But from everything That I've been hearing It's clear he brought a lot of love To a lot of people You have no idea While I have you Would you happen to know if There's been a resolution Regarding the cemetery? I've been told it's Pleasant Meadows I've also been told it's Shady Glen I know you think Henry wanted To be buried At Shady Glen - He did want To be buried at Shady Glen We picked out those plots Only last year But he gave out the payment On Pleasant Meadows Even after that I can show you The cancelled cheques Veronica? I appreciate that you are Henry's partner But please don't forget That I was his wife Please keep your voices down Has anyone here happen to speak To the American Consulate in Mexico? No Why? Barbie? Not now What? Really mom Later Please! Apparently Daddy wasn't alone in Mexico I knew it Was he with some sort of shaman? There was ...

In the viewing room Thank you ever so much Oh, and Two extra thingies of the Tangy honey mustard sauce Thank you gorgeous Were you all waiting for me? Henry ... Closed casket I didn't realize it was this bad I wanted a closed casket because I believe when someone dies He deserves his privacy And not to be gawked at So he wasn't disfigured? No Oh thank God Look at us here together It's like the reunion we never had Let's hold hands C'mon, for Henry! We have things we share in common With nobody else in the world We've all known the better ... We've all known the worst ... In all four of Henry Lefay's marriages Five! Oh yes Two of which were to me of course Which does give me a sort of seniority ... Screw you! Honey, I'm just trying to say That though we may all think We know how Henry Wanted to say goodbye to this earth He did write it all down for me In a deeply personal letter So I stopped And I made copies on the way That's why I was late I've got my own letter too Exactly exactly like this In mine he wanted a Catholic priest Did you say Catholic? In a pig's eye Timeout! I'm the current wife I'm making the decisions About the ceremony You know, A good compromise would be his childhood pastor If I wanted your opinion I would've asked for it Get it? May I say something About the casket? What about the casket? I think it should be open People want to see that he's alright Mom, will you stop saying that, It's screwed up No! I agree with Kate Open open open! I am the wife Me! I make all the decisions About everything Right But Henry did want to be cremated Well that's not happening Well it's what he wanted Nobody is getting cremated So just stick it up your ass! Oh no no no no no ... Hey! You're gonna tip it over! Stop! Oh Daddy Daddy Daddy What have you done now?

I was Henry's very first wife Well I'm sure some of you know about The time that Henry dropped out of college And went to Chicago To try to be a blues musician? Well the very week That boy got into town I ain't gonna lie He knocked me right off my feet But pretty soon I could see he didn't belong in Chicago With or without me So ... After 3 months We got an annulment And I sent him back home To New York Never saw Henry Lefay Or heard his voice again There are no paper towels In the ladies' room Grandma! She doesn't work here Uhm I'm sorry But I must ask you straight out What exactly do you want here?

Yeah Y'know I would imagine this shock Is the biggest for you Woman thinks she's the man's first wife Is gotta be mighty unsettling To find out she isn't Y'know I truly regret Any pain this causes you Can I ask you something? Yeah If you've been out of touch With my father since Chicago How did you know so much About all of us? The internet, honey Yes, may've been about Let's see about 5 years ago Out of the blue don't you know Henry Lefay up and tracks me down And sends me an email Just wanted to know Whatever happened to me, y'know?

Everyday Get out Well I didn't hear from him A few days I just Just got this bad feeling And I thought I'd better give that boy a Google And sure enough Well y'all know the rest Apparently Henry's had All kinds of secrets There's no reason not to believe this one Oh not so fast How do we know this isn't Some kind of a scam? That you're not inserting yourself Into Henry's life Under false pretenses just so You can get something from us Later? Oh you mean like the time You pretended you were pregnant So Henry could leave Veronica And marry your bony ass A second time? Cause you are Ophelia Aren't you?
