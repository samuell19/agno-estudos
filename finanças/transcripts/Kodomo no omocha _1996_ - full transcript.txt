Sana-chan! Are you alright? I'm fine! I'm fine! Don't be worried! Sana-chan... you are weird! SHUT UUUUP!!!!!!!!! Hayama! Why don't we settle this with a little game, huh? A game? What game would that be when you have Hayama-san for an opponent, huh?? Rock-paper-scissors? Zip it, monkeyboy. It will be kept on like this! Let's have a fight to see who is really in charge here. Oh my, she's serious. Looks like it. After school. You'd better come... and be prepared. What is she thinking? Will Sana-chan beat Hayama-san? Everyone, it's the time of a class!

He's so quiet! Oh, yes mademoiselle, it is true. You really like joking! Um, Sana-chan, this is too unkind to Akito-kun. What are you saying? Holding his blindspot... This might be a little unfair to let him do so... but think of what he does... this is nothing! Do you know that? Hurry up, how about Hayama? If I win... you have to obey all my orders! If I win... I won't let you... get in my way. Okay! Aya-chan. Get the mic. Excuse me. I'm leaving! So great! So great! Yes! I'm gonna win! I'm gonna win cause I love heights! Bungee Watch with Hayama!

I'm not scared at all! Take care, my sweet angel! What are you saying?! OK! OK! Here I goooo! Damn, look at her odd pose. Really cocky, isn't she? Sana-chan! Where'd her confidence go? I... LOVE heights... I'm very happy! But I've never fallen from them... before. This is my blindspot! I don't know what's the matter! But it seems that I have won! I lost... Yes yes, thank you, thank you. It's too pathetic. It's just a little bungee jump. FRUSTRATED! When you were a baby... I used to throw you 3 meters above my head... and you loved it. 3 METERS!?!? It's high! It's high! It's high! It's high! That must be the reason... why I lost today! It must be because I felt down then. Sana-chan! That's tomorrow's script! Um, I'm Onda from the publisher... and we've been waiting since last week for your article. Is it ready yet? Not at all! Singing Sana-chan The color of defeat is a dark dark blue! The color of defeat is a dark dark blue! Though the sky shines, my heart's a midnight sky Rain is falling and it's dark dark blue I'm a loser twist girl, I lost, I lost... What's gonna happen tomorrow at school? My school just SUCKS! Anything but frogs! Quit it! Look at him! Isn't he cuuute?? HEY! Shut up. I can't take this anymore! Alright! I feel... I'm such an idiot. Sana-chan, don't be depressed... or you'll be a maggot! That's DISGUSTING! Did I say something wrong? How to Comfort Women! What kind of book are you reading? Sana-chan, you just stand and let this happen? Don't! Please don't! I'll never rest... Uncle uncle... Uncle uncle uncle. Don't be so angry or you'll be a mosquito! Shut up! You! Quit it! Come on! Don't be so noisy! Delivery. Right here. Pizza's here? What in the book all are false! Why you!!! Does it taste good? Tanaka-sensei... this is all your fault! Why don't you make them stop! If you're a teacher... just act like one! Don't you know how to do that? Right? Hey, don't cry. What's wrong? Don't wipe it with both hands! Bad manners! I can't stand it! I HATE BEING A TEACHER!!! Sensei! What's wrong, sensei!? What's the matter, sensei! Tanaka-sensei's Confession Kurata... What in the devil's name happened? You are too gloomy, sensei. Tell the truth... No, forget it! This isn't the kind of thing to tell a kid, but... Why don't you spit it all out? You'll feel much better. Really? Yes, you're right. Uh, um... what should I say? I'm... uh... With your teacher... Mitsuya-sensei... Uh... and we... I don't know how to say! You've been going out, right? Everyone knows that. Really? We... We often sit this gymnasium... chatting or drinking tea... Then Hayama found out. Hayama? ...and he took a picture of us. A picture? At that time... It was romantic... and we... uh, we... You were making out? Uh... yes. F0PERVERT!!! You needn't yell that loud! I trained my voice at Komawari. I'm a little dizzy though... Oh, by the way... I'm very surprised to know that... teachers were making out in school! She allowed me to make out in order to dance the Chi-Chi-Ku-Ri Mambo! Make out... mambo... Don't dance any longer, please! All that's what happened. He now has us by our weak spot... ...because we can't have the principal knowing about this. My god! Poor teachers! But I won't forgive him! That Hayama! How unfair!!! Oh, Sana, you look marvelous. Thank you! Hey, Sana-chan... You seem to be energetic today! You don't look like an actress. Right? Cause I look like a real coward. So you are so strong! I'm thinking about that idiot. But I'm very angry thinking about him! Which idiot? How can I get that picture of the teachers making out? Making out?! What? It's interesting! Give me all the details!! If you can get that make-out picture back... ...I think things will be a bit different. Why, of course! But first, tell me about the picture! I want to ask him to give me the picture aboveboard! It's impossible that he give to me just like that. You think so? You have to tell me more about the picture... before I can give you advice. Don't worry. There's a way around that. Really? But before that, tell me more about the picture. Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth! What's that? No... Before you explain that... explain to me the making out... I mean the way... is that you could take a picture of an embarrassing moment for Hayama. Then what you say you'll show the picture to everybody! If you reject me... I'll show the picture to the others! What an idea! Rei-kun, you are so smart! It's a little unfair... ...but he's doing it too. Oh, I love it when you're a bad boy! Well, ask Tsuyoshi-kun to help me, OK?! Tsuyoshi-kun? Is he the boy with glasses? Watch out, Hayama! Eye for eyeball! Tooth for tooth! What's a tooth? Sana-chan this week! Isn't that Hayama's house? I'm Sherlock Holmes! I got the costume free from Komawari, complete with pipe! Sana-chan, do you go by the look of things? And this is my Polaroid camera. I'm gonna take a picture of... his embarrassing moment! Forget this, Sana-chan. No program! You mean problem. Tsuyoshi-kun, you just stand aside, don't worry. Then how can I lure him out, Washington? It's! Shut up you little freak! You make me sick! What was that? I think it's his sister. Get out of the house right now!! This isn't your house... you hysteric psycho! What was that?? You never should've been born in the first place! Get out! Get out! A sibling fight? You're nothing but a little devil! Don't you ever come back! Never, never come back, you little devil! Devil? Is she his real sister? I don't believe it. How horrible... Hayama... Look, it's his father. Hayama's father... Why? Why? Is he Hayama's real father? Why doesn't he ask what happened? Why? Why? Hey, what should we do? He's getting away, Sana-chan. Sana-chan! I'm shocked. I've never seen him make a face like that. Sana-chan, should we stop? Let's stop now. Hey, let's follow him. You won't stop after all. I can't forgive him after all he's done. He goes into the park. Foolish Hayama, you are working your own ruin now! Now's our chance, Tsuyoshi-kun. Hurry up! Operation Eye for an Eyeball, Tooth for a Tooth. When did you name it? Don't ask questions... or you'll never be a great detective! I don't wanna be a detective. C'mon, go! Don't push me, Sana-chan. Hurry up! Now I'm gonna get even. Why, hello, Akito-kun! What a pleasant surprise! How about your hand? It's nothing. Now's the chance! Go! Forgive me, Akito-kun! You... Tsuyoshi... What the hell are you doing!?! I got you now, Hayama! I caught you with your pants down and captured the moment! Have a look! Here it is! You look stupid! All right then... I'll Xerox this and post it around the school! You... What did you do? You shouldn't be angry! You are just my teacher! Are you angry? Are you frustrated? Well, this is nothing! I'll post it if you do anything... to Tsuyoshi-kun. Now, come and get me! Vibrating Buruccha! Alright, Sana-chan! Go! Can you keep up with the step... I mastered at Komawari? Humm, do we have a vertical align top? (babbit's at the top right) Great Rei-kun! Nice timing! If you do anything to Sana-chan... I'll plaster the town with this! Now... Hayama Akito-kun... Give me... the teacher's picture. Hurry up! The cliche... I'm going insane... should be used in a situation like this. In great distress... I waited for his reply I had everything planned out... my love confession is on schedule I may have my mind made up... but I'm still in panic! He was there... when my friend suddenly invited me. In that ordinary classroom! We became the merry-go-round. I've been acting like ajerk lately... but today I digress. I'll tell you my heart! So the boy look back at me! He was there... when my friend suddenly invited me. In that ordinary classroom!
