BASED ON A REAL DREAM I want all the Malmö supporters to look to the midfield. Let me introduce you to Malmö's new number 10: Eric Hansson! Eric! Eric, you're taking up the whole bed! Huh? I have to get some sleep. - Sorry, I was dreaming. - Go to sleep. Yeah... 10,000 HOURS Today's a big day: first day back at work. Monday. But Mondays are always important. Every Monday, me and my colleague Bengtsson meet up to buy scratch cards. - Back after vacation! - Hey. It starts our week in a good way. Our biggest win was Bengtsson winning 5,000 SEK last year. - Hi, Hasim! What's up? - Return of the Iron Men! Hasim calls us "the Iron Men." Is it time for the big win? We work for a metal wholesaler. The joy isn't in the small wins, it's fantasizing about what we'd do with a big win. Whoever has the best fantasy on Monday gets treated to their Friday beer. Bengtsson dreams about Las Vegas and one of the girls from the office, usually Eva at reception. He recently got divorced. Anything for me? Bengtsson usually wins because my fantasies, well... they lack imagination. But today, I have a scratch card fantasy that is guaranteed to win and get me a free beer on Friday. What have you got for me today? Emma gave me this. It's one of those self-improvement books. In it, it says that anyone can become a professional in anything as long as you put in 10,000 hours of dedicated practice. Eight hours a day for five years. If I win 25,000 kronor a month for five years, then I'll resign and become... A pimp! Lifeguard? Boy Toy? Dolphin trainer? Top Gun pilot! I'm going to become a professional soccer player. - Professional soccer player? - Yeah. - You can't play soccer. - I was good as a kid. My knees were acting up. My point is that it takes 10,000 hours! Ten thousand hours? How much is that? Eight hours a day for five years. Aren't you listening?! It's our best winning fantasy ever! - Congratulations, Eric. Thank you. - No. I'm not impressed. Listen to this. Learjet to Las Vegas. I'll paint the airplane gold. - Mine's a bit more realistic. - I'll bring Eva from reception. It'll be like in Pretty Woman when they go to the opera and she cries. Then we'll go to the jeweler's and I'll get her a necklace in a box. Shut up for a second! - That's great... - Shut up! What's up? Ehm... I won. How much? Twenty-five thousand kronor a month for five years. Or...? Let me see! Holy shit! Damn... Damn! Amazing! Yes! Yeah! You won! You're awesome! - Now what? - What do you mean? What are you going to do with all the money? Professional soccer player. - No. Pay off your mortgage. - Give me a break. Can you even play soccer? I told you, I played as a kid! It's here somewhere. Hold this. And this. You take this. There it is! All right, let's go! This'll do. Let's see. - One hundred juggles now. - Juggles? Juggle the ball. One hundred times with your feet. Show me what you can do. - Is this normal size? - The dog stole it from a kindergarten. - Come on. One hundred juggles. - It's not called "juggles," is it? Okay, juggles. One, two, three... Damn it! One more time, it landed badly on my knee. Never mind. You should pay off your mortgage. See you later. Bengtsson! I have to practice for 10,000 hours. There's a lot of time left. - Does it count if it's stuck up there? - Yes. Damn it! Eric! Yeah! - Unbelievable. - I know! - It's crazy. - Twenty-five thousand! Huh? I... It's so weird. Twenty-five thousand a month for five years. Not all the money in the world, but it's a decent mortgage installment. If we commit to the more aggressive installment plan... - could we remortgage? - Absolutely! With regards to the size of the win, I can't see that being a problem. That's great. We have to redo the drainage, and that's expensive. Very expensive! Or... And that will increase the value of the house. Hey... I was thinking about this new mortgage idea. - Isn't it great? - Yeah. But I also thought that makes it feel like nothing's happened. - What do you mean? - There's no big difference, I mean. - We're investing our money in the house. - Yeah, of course. That's good. - What? - The drainage, it's... It's underground work that you cover with dirt. You can't really see that any work has been done. I just thought we could do something... a little crazy, you know. What do you mean? Something different... if we want to. Haven't you seen the lawn when it's raining? Puddles everywhere. That's true. That's noticeable, for sure. I'm going to be busy with the conference. Can you deal with the bank? - Mm. - Let's keep this to ourselves. It's a bit embarrassing winning all this money we haven't worked for. - Yeah. - This will be great. - Paperwork, the bank, do it. - Will do. Isn't it amazing that we can get that damn drainage fixed? Will you get the butter? I thought we could donate money to charity. - Didn't you get the butter? - What? No. I know of this great irrigation project in Sudan. That's great. And I thought... maybe it's time for us to have kids. - Exactly. I've also done some thinking. - Oh, yeah? Really, I won the lottery. We didn't. - That sounded bad. - Yeah, it did. - Yeah... - I thought we shared our finances. Yeah, our joint account. Did you use that for scratch cards? No. If I want to buy a new computer, I use my own money, like with the scratch cards. You want a new computer? Look. Remember this book? You got it for me for my birthday. In it, it says that anyone can become a professional in any field as long as you put in 10,000 hours of dedicated practice. Look. Eight hours a day, five days a week times 50 weeks a year... for five years is... How many hours? Ten thousand. Yeah...? So I thought maybe I should put 10,000 hours into getting good at something. - So, you want to go to college? - No, it has to be more specific. I figure I should spend 10,000 hours, five years and try to become a... soccer player. Eh... - Yeah. - You can't. - I can. Ten thousand hours. - Who will you play with? - Well, I... - You want to do it professionally? Well... it doesn't have to be so black and white. You want to put 10,000 hours into becoming a professional soccer player? Yes. - You can't. - I can. - You can't have thought this through. - I've thought about it a lot, actually. It's a lot more fun than redoing the drainage. - You're making me a little angry. - Why did you give me the book, then? I don't know. They had probably sold out of slippers in your size. - I took it as a suggestion. - Stop it! I thought maybe you'd start playing the flute. I didn't think you'd quit your job to become a soccer player! Should I stay at home and watch TV for five years? Some people would! Emma, come on! Watching TV for five years would at least be understandable! A reasonable person could see that it's possible. I'll do that, then. And take up the flute! I could take a leave of absence. Hi! Ehm... Do you have those forms... for applying for leave of absence? No, you don't. Can you keep an eye on this? - This is good. The team's doing well. - Mm... The sale to Japan is great. Really great! - You got them good. - Yeah. What are our rules about taking a leave of absence? - We don't have any. - I wanted to see if I could do that. Okay. What are you going to use it for? Something funny happened the other day. I won some money. So I thought maybe I can become a professional soccer player. Maybe. Hey... listen to me. - There's no need to be rude. - No. If one of our competitors has hired you, you should just come out and say so. - Is it Edström's Metal Works? - No. - Has that old man Edström called you? - No. On your work phone? That I pay for? And offered you a job?! I'm going to become a soccer player. Don't you lie to me! Idiot! You're going to regret this! Intense! Instant dismissal, that can't be legal. I can't explain it. I just reached out and cut... - Shouldn't you be at work? - I phoned my cell from the office phone. If the office phone's engaged, they think you're working. - What if they call both phones? - Then you're working twice as hard. What about these? One hundred ninety-nine kronor, that's pretty good. Bengtsson! - They're all right. - No, they're too cheap. Excuse me! Hi! Can you help us? You need quality stuff from the get-go. Hi... Tora. We want the same shoes as Zlatan Ibrahimović. - Okay. I don't think we have them. - Huh? - They're probably custom-made. - We'll take your most expensive shoes. - Size 15. - 11.5. - 11.5. - Okay. Grass or gravel? - Gravel, please. - Grass. Grass. - Are you sure? - Grass. Grass. Okay. - Do you think Ibrahimović plays on gravel? - No, that's kind of my point. Mine, too. Let's buy you a ball and some clothes. I think they're... No. - How does it feel? - A little tight, maybe. - Have you worn soccer shoes before? - Yeah! As a kid. They're a little different these days. How do they feel? - A little too yellow. - Well... - Try walking around. - Mm. - Is there an office match happening? - No. You'd laugh. - Tell me. - I won a scratch card. So I'm going to be a soccer player. Right... - Instead of working in an office? - Yeah. I quit. - I cut my boss' tie off. - Wow. - Then you can't really change your mind. - No... What? - No going back. - No... That's right. Hey...? - Are you okay? - Sorry. I just got a bit woozy. - Do you want to take the shoes off? - No. - Do you need a bag? - No, I'm fine. Hey. Tora, right? Is there a team we could join? - What's that? - The national uniform. Let's go! It's game time! How do you feel? - I feel ridiculous. Look at me! - Hey! Hi! You'll be fine. - Hi! - Hi. - How are the shoes? - Like wearing platform boots. You'll get used to it. Come, it's the prison lunch game. Come on. - Did she say "prison"? - Yeah. That's cool. No, no... It's dangerous! Look at this. Wow! Come on. What the hell, Bengtsson? We've got another player! Come on. Bengtsson! Let's just sit down. - Let's just watch for a bit. - No, let's go. Come on. - No... - Come on! Here's another player! Come on, get it together. Hi! - Well... - I can just watch, it's fine. No, everyone can play, but you have to wear a dark or white T-shirt. If not, you'll have to go shirtless. Yellow won't work. - What are you waiting for? Take it off. - Yeah... Let's do it. Pass it to Eric, the new guy! - Are you all right? - I should have passed to... - Okay... Oh, shit! Damn! - Oh. Oh! That doesn't look good. - You should sit down. - It's not so bad. - Ow! - How will you explain this to your wife? - Do you think I'm going to hide it? - Just until she gets used to it. - Hide the shoes in the garage. - How do I explain this, then? - Just act surprised. - Ow! - What are you doing? - Stretching. Hey, that's our ball! - Hey. How are you doing? - I'm fine, it's just... - You're great. - LDB has benched me for two years. So I'm not good enough or motivated enough, depending on who you ask. - And if I ask you? - Not good enough, not for the big teams. Hmm. But when I see you, I believe those who say I'm not motivated enough. Well...! - I need to get back to work. - What was that? For your efforts. They're inspiring. Practice some ball control until next time. Spend time with the ball. - Sleep with it, eat with it. - Okay. Become the ball! - Hello! - Hello! How have you been? - Hi! - What was that? What? Why are you throwing your bag into the guest room? - What have you done to your knee?! - Damn... Is that blood? I think we have to disinfect it. You can bite down on a stick. - Like in the Wild West. - If you pour whiskey on it. - Ready? - Ouch! - Are you okay? - Yeah. Mm. You've got nice legs. No. Yes, you do. - Do I? - Yeah. - Don't you think they're skinny? - No, they're strong. First time I saw you, I thought, "He's got nice legs." Hey... Wasn't this a bit... Maybe it's time. What about your job? I don't know. It's never a good time. Maybe we should let it happen naturally. - Hey... - Yeah? What happened to your knee? Your pants were fine. Did you remove them before falling over? Well... Or did things get wild with your mistress? No. What? - Have you cheated on me? - No. - What the hell is this? - Bengtsson pushed me on the field. The soccer... This 10,000 hours thing. Bengtsson said... I had to juggle it 100 times to not ask for a leave of absence. Then I made a bad kick and it all ended with me... I ended up getting fired. So we figured it doesn't matter anyway, we might as well... play a bit, juggle a bit. I didn't get all of that, but it seems like you... have quit your job to play soccer for 10,000 hours. What? No. Well, yeah. Kind of. Oh... Okay. - Aren't you mad? - I'm furious. But you and Bengtsson seem to have talked about it, so I'm sure it'll be fine. If you screwed me well enough for me to end up pregnant, the kid can drive you to practice in a few years. But... Thanks! - Toast? Nice! - Thanks. Eric! Eric! Can you hurry up? I'll be late for work. I'm in a rush, too! - It was your toothbrush. - I'll have to boil it. No, it's just liver pâté. - Good luck with your big speech. - Thank you. Good luck with... - What are you doing? - Practicing ball control. Bengtsson called. He wanted me to drop in at ten. Can I take the car? - Hi! - Wait, I'm almost done. - My old desk... - Your things are there. - What's this? - Hang on, I'm almost done. - That's 10,000... - That's what's up! - What's up? - How many hours have you done? - "Done"? - The soccer. Your 10,000-hour plan. Well... - Twenty-six... 28! - Twenty-eight, yes! Five, ten, 15, 20, 25, 28. There. Isn't it better to draw lines than to remove them? It's the same amount of lines either way. I want to show you something. - Why are you keeping track of this? - Because I'm your manager. You can't do this on your own, so I've made a 10,000-hour plan. Today, 10,000 hours, Champions League. Bengtsson. My aim is to maybe play in the sixth division. The most important thing is to get really good at something specific. - Excellence. - Okay. What if your throw-ins were ten meters longer than anyone else's? - Hmm. - That would be your brand. "That's the guy who can throw further than anyone else. Let's get him." Yeah, yeah... - I'll have to work on my arms, then. - Huh? - I have to work on my throw-ins. - No. Throw-ins are too difficult. - Free kicks are much easier. - Are they? Much easier. - I'm not sure about this. - Listen to me. - Free kicks are going to be your thing. - Then I need to be doing them. No, it's too hard. Hasim is good at free kicks. He played in the Malmö under-16 team. - Will you shoot hard? - I'll hold back a bit. Listen. One coward always leaves the wall when the ball comes towards them. Then the other team scores. I don't want that to be you. I want you to be the best one at staying in the wall, to take one for the team. - Let's do it. - Hold back a bit! Don't worry, he won't hit you. You just need to get used to the ball. Be strong! Fuck! - You were supposed to hold back! - Bengtsson. I told you, it's not as easy as it looks. Have some water. We'll deal with this. - Hi! How are the shoes? - Hey, you. - The shoes. - Yeah, good. They've started to stretch. - They feel better. - Try these. Gravel shoes, size 12. - Since you're playing on gravel. - Did you buy them? The inventory's never correct. You stole them? Should I return them? Well, I... No. Hi, Tora! Oh, new shoes. - Perfect! There they are. - Huh? - What's this? - The media. - It's in the plan I showed you. - You didn't mention the media. Yeah, on page three. Are they filming me? Why? The plan only had two pages. If you want to get anywhere, we have to use the media. Hi! Great! - Did you know about this? - No, I just live nearby. - It looked a bit weird. - It's only going to get weirder. - My name is Eric Hansson. - What brings you here? I won some money on a scratch card and realized work wasn't that fun. I quit and now I'm putting in 10,000 hours towards becoming a soccer player. - That sounded really stupid. - Is it true about the money? What? Yeah, it's true. Can we start again? - Why don't you show us your training? - Sure. Okay... Is he in the shot? Great. Bengtsson, I'm happy with the sixth division. Is it rolling? Good. This is it. This is crucial. Okay? The best one in the wall. Don't move a muscle. - Eye of the tiger. - Eye of the what? Make the sign of the cross like the great players. Use some gravel. I won't cross myself. Tell Hasim to go easy. Aim for his head. That will make great TV. Hey, manager guy! We've got places to be. Can we get going? Are you rolling? Okay. There... Yes. Take it easy. Action! Thank you, Bengt Göran Gran from the Västmanland district. I'd like to welcome our next speaker from the Malmö district, a young woman who will talk about the future view on workers. - Welcome, Emma... - No surprises, I hope. Thank you. I've become a Moderate. If I look at polls of women from the ages of 35 to 39 with a college degree, a well-paying job and a house in one of the major cities, the chance of me voting for the Labor Party is very small. I'm more likely to vote for "the New Labor Party," the Moderates. "The New Labor Party, the Moderates"? How the hell did this happen? - You can boo, but look at the statistics. - Go home, you snob! No, I'm not going home. I'm going to fight for my sisters to feel at home in the labor movement, not despite them having good jobs, but because of it! We build our society by working together. That work is less commonly done in the mines or by the heat of a furnace. That work is more likely to be well-paying and happening at research institutes, banks and consulting firms. The dividing line in the future shouldn't be between high and low earners. It should be between those who work because they want to contribute to society and, on the other side, those who put their own interests first. Thank you. - That was great. - I don't remember what I said. - Hasim! Ice cream! - I'll take it. I need to pay him anyway. - You're paying Hasim? - One hundred an hour, 25 for mannequins. - Bengtsson... - Hasim! Did it get weird with the TV, the wall of mannequins and... my nose? - Do you want me to answer that? - No. No... but, hey. It doesn't matter what he does. It matters that he's here. Friends like that are rare. - He's skipping work. - Exactly. Friends like that are rare. Doesn't this feel like summer vacation? I've paid Hasim for two hours. We've been playing for an hour and a half. So... what do you say? - Let's do it! - Yeah! Good one! Good one! Good! One more. Well! You stepped on quite a few toes. - Someone has to tell the truth. - Sure. Like I say: if you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen. Are you ready to take the next step? Let's see how brave you are in front of a camera. Sure. Good. And, on the other side, those who put their own interests first. Thank you, that was great. You're good at this. - Thank you. Are we done? - Just wait a minute. We need to move the camera and get a shot of me for the edit. It's a bit slow sometimes. Your view on work is really interesting. That everyone has a responsibility to contribute. You can also see it as a privilege. Absolutely. How's your family? You're married. What does your husband do? He works for a company that imports and exports iron. - That's a "real job"! - Yes... but he's in the office. That's kind of my point. Fewer people do manual labor these days. And... so he... Will you let me know when you start again? Damn it. I forgot to turn it off, so I think I got what you said about your husband. - Should we record over it? - No, it might be good to have. Eh... If you want to rewind, I can wait. No, it happens all the time. Don't worry about it. - We'll just keep going. - I just thought... - Hello! - I was wondering where you were. - Why have you got my suit jacket? - We're going to a thing for the Party. - How come? - The local news interviewed me today. The district bigwigs invited us to watch the broadcast. - Really? At practice today... - We need to hurry. Let's talk in the car. - Iron your lapels. - Actually, I was also... - I feel a little nervous. - I understand that. I didn't ask for this, but it's like a door has opened for me. Things have been set in motion. One little thing. Could you stay away from the soccer stuff tonight? - What do you mean? - Just don't talk about it. Just say you're still at the steel company. - That would be almost like lying. - Can't you just do what I ask? - Are you embarrassed about the soccer? - No, but... We don't have to discuss it now. So I should hide the truth without even knowing why? Stop it, Eric! Sorry. Damn it! Well... It's just that I... At one point today, I thought the camera was off when it was on. I said you're still at the steel company. When I had said it, I couldn't really take it back. - I feel like I've lied to them. - To the local news? Exactly. So maybe we can keep the soccer thing to ourselves? That might be a problem, because I've also talked to them. What? They came by the soccer field, and... - Yeah... - What?! I said working isn't really that fun. It isn't. I tried explaining, but you won't listen. - It feels like you're ashamed of me. - Listen to me, Eric. - You can't play soccer professionally. - Maybe not in Champions League. - Maybe the sixth division... - Eric, listen to me! You can't become a professional if you start at age 36. Yes, you can. And it takes 10,000 hours. It can be done. Damn it. This is what we'll do. Get Bengtsson to go to the news station and stop the segment. Okay. What's up?! Huh? Hi! Do you know who's in charge here? Yeah, I... Can't I just skip this and wait for you? If this goes badly, I don't want to be alone with the shame. Come on. Hi. Damn, a butler! - Champagne? - No, I think I'll have to drive tonight. The flagship... - Hello. - How's it going? I think it'll be fine. I'm at their office in the newsroom. Hurry up a bit! I don't think they've realized that Emma is your wife. Hey, Bengtsson... Hello? Bengtsson! I have to hang up. - Bengtsson... - Yes. Eh... I'll speak to you later. I have to hang up. Bye. Okay. Bengtsson? Hello? Bengtsson! - How's it going? - Good. It'll be fine. That's great! I feel much better now. You're not drinking! - I haven't had time. - Here. Cheers. Honey. I'm going to fight for my sisters to feel at home in the labor movement, not despite them having good jobs, but because of it! In an interview, Steen-Hansson elaborated on her view on work. In the labor movement, we have to update our views on what work is. The meaning of the word "worker" has changed. The line shouldn't be between high and low earners, but between those who work because they want to contribute to society and those who put their own interests first. What does your husband do? He works for a company that imports and exports iron. Our reporter was Katarina Bengtsson. Let's look at the weather. What do you say, fellow Party members? Shouldn't we ask our provocative rising star onto the stage? What do you think? Emma! Whoopsie! Thank you! I think that we can come together... that we can unite in a feeling of... Hi, Bengtsson. Thank you. That was great. Thanks a lot! The local news dropped it, but something else happened. They started talking about newsworthiness, journalistic integrity and stuff. - So it turned into something else. - What? - You might as well turn on the TV. - What's going to happen? I should probably hang up. I'll speak to you later! I'll call you later. Bye! Bengtsson! That's where I think the labor movement has a lot to offer in the current climate of Swedish politics. - And... - Look, there's more. Turn up the volume! He works for a company that imports and exports iron. But that's not really true. It turns out her husband has a different "job" entirely. Look. My name is Eric Hansson. I won some money on a scratch card. I realized work wasn't that fun, so I quit to become a soccer player. That sounded really stupid. - Is it true about the money? - Yes. - Can we start again? - Why don't you show us your training? Damn it to hell! Action! - Are you okay? - I'm fine. - What are you doing here? - We're practicing free kicks. Shouldn't you be doing the free kick, then? Yeah, but we changed it around. We're practicing the wall... The other way... Bengtsson. Damn it! - That looks bad. - I'm fine. Just a sec... Huh?! What a fun guy. You'd vote for him, not his wife. We've got an amazing program. Timbuktu is joining us. And former high jumper Stefan Holm. Eric! Ten thousand hours! Eric! - You were on TV, too. - I saw that. I'm so wasted. Let's go home. I don't feel well. - Eric. - We have to get gas. You know... Bengtsson. - Emma... - I thought maybe... I'll cut his balls off. Snip, snip. I don't think that many people watched it. "Ow! My name is Bengtsson! No, my balls!" Don't worry about people recognizing you. They won't. - No one will recognize me. - Eric, I love you... - We have to get gas. - Come on, Eric. - Let's make out. - Emma! - Emma, I have to get gas. - Eric, you're a nobody. - Whoo! Hey... - Please, I have to get gas. - Don't be such a Goody Two-shoes. - No one will recognize you. No one watched the program. Please, Emma. - We have to get gas. - I feel quite drunk. Is that him? That's him! - Come on. - Can you get me a glass of water? Thank you. Should we talk about it? We'll talk tomorrow. What's that sound? The rain. No, it's coming from inside. What the hell? Shit! What's happened?! It smells like soil. Damn it! What the... Well... My feet feel a bit tingly. Shit! Damn... It'll be all right. No, it won't. We can't do things without talking to each other. Say something. Maybe I should call a pump guy. I'll do that. - What should we do? - That's up to you. The electricity is out, so you need to call someone to fix that. I'd get a hotel if I were you. I should make some calls. Maybe you want some time for yourself? I can stay with Bengtsson. Yeah, maybe. I'll go and pack some things. You're just giving up? - Huh? - On us. - You're giving us up for soccer? - You wanted some alone time. I do now. It gets a bit messy when I don't have the kids. Not when you have the kids? This is where I sleep. We can share it if you want. It's close to the TV. Or you can take the kids' room. - We can look at it. - Yeah. - This is the kids' room. - Wow, that's nice. Mm. It's not their fault that Johanna met Carlos. - No. - Check this out. What's that? It's you. Yeah, it is. What's that on his knee? - It's your bandage. - Oh! And there I am. There. - Isn't it nice? There's Emma. - Huh. There's Tora. She's always on her bike. And there's Hasim. Yeah... - Did you make it? - Yeah, with my kids. Amazing. - It's very nice. - Mm. Perfect weather for training! - Shouldn't you be at work? - I said I had a funeral to attend. - Who died? - We need to make a stop on the way. Hurry up! Let's go, kids! Get in! Watch your fingers. Are you comfortable? - Shouldn't they be in there learning? - This is the school of life. - And I said... - That they had a funeral to attend. We have to cheer Uncle Eric up. His girlfriend broke up with him. She didn't break up with me and she's my wife. Don't poke my ear! Your sense of balance is in the ear. That's dangerous. Are you ready? Three, two, one, let's go! Goals, goals, goals Lots of goals And goals we're going to achieve Let's go! We want goals, goals, goals Lots of goals There we are. - What's that? - Balls and cones. All coaches have them. Come on, kids. Come on, Eric. - What's this? - I don't know. Maybe we have fans. Look, kids! - Hi, Tora! - What's this? They saw you on TV. They like your 10,000-hour thing. Look, kids, there they are! Hey! - Bengtsson... - Didn't I tell you? The local news want to do a follow-up. Come, let's say hi. Hi. Welcome. Can't you shut up?! Stop clapping! Are you stupid? Go home to your kids or wives. Go to work! You, too, Bengtsson. It was my scratch card! I don't need plans or managers or reporters. Go to work! Go on. You can stay. No? Emma! Good! Help her. Other side! That's good. Go on. On the side! Yes! Don't let... Tora, where are you going? Where do you think you're going? Come back! Tora! Damn it. 10,000 HOURS Your run-ups have to be shorter. Take two steps forward. A little more. That's it. Long run-ups are too risky. Focus on accuracy. It doesn't matter. I'm going to stop playing. I want my wife back. So you'll get your wife back if you stop playing soccer? Isn't it too late? What are you doing here in the middle of the night if you don't want to play? I want to play soccer for 10,000 hours and keep my wife if I can. - So, why don't you? - Because it doesn't work. Emma... I don't know. - What are you doing? - Don't blame her. - I thought you were on my side! - And what side is that, Eric? Maybe she just doesn't want you to turn your lives upside down all of a sudden. That's pretty reasonable. You just decide something. - Pretty selfish if you ask me. - I told you, I'm going to stop. - Ow! Calm down! - Short run-up, see? I said I'm quitting soccer. Isn't that even more selfish? What? You showed her your dream and now she'll feel guilty for your giving it up. Now what? It's time to sleep. Where will you do that? - At Bengtsson's. - Did you apologize to his kids? No. Hey... - Hey... - Mm? - I'm still going to quit soccer. - It's up to you. I need your help making it into a spectacle. A real spectacle. A spectacle. - Grass. - Yeah. - Are you ready for a spectacle? - Yes. Okay, let's go! One hundred. Go! Good. - Hi. Oh, there's that. - Let's put that away. - I brought you a gift. - For me? Thank you. Oh... That foot. No... Good! No, start again. Seven, eight... No! Good! - There, a hundred kronor. - This will be great. I can't juggle in a square the size of a pea. Try it. Ninety... four, five, six, seven, eight. One hundred. Whoo! Hi, it's Eric. You're supposed to press the green button. Maybe you hit the wrong one. I sent you a text about the channel and time if you want to watch TV tonight. It would be nice. Anyway... Bye. You sure about this? We're ready to go. - It's rolling. - Go ahead. So... we've changed coaches. Since Eric wasn't picked for any of the teams, we've hired Hasim. - What do you get paid? - A hundred an hour. So you're the professional soccer player? What do you say, are you ready to meet him in person? Yeah! Ten seconds! - Spectacle. - Come here. Come here! - Ouch! - You're ready. Wait... Go! Ladies and gentlemen... - How's it going? - He just came out. What a bastard. - Welcome. How do you feel? - Good. First of all, I think everyone's wondering, how's your head? Oh... It's fine. From what I understand, you have something to reveal? Yeah, I'm leaving soccer. I'm retiring, I guess. That's too bad. Your career was short. I've made a bit of a mess for my wife. Even though I'm quitting, I just want to say that. Don't fall for it. My wife has a job where a lot of people have strong opinions. When we won the scratch card, she wanted to give money to charity, but I was stubborn and wanted to play soccer. I want people to know that. Let's ask the audience. Who thinks Eric should continue playing soccer? A sea of hands. Everyone wants you to continue. - Give the audience a chance. - I've already made up my mind. This is what I think. Can I have that? If you manage to juggle this ball 100 times... No, 200 times. Then you'll continue playing soccer. And next time I run into a fundraiser in the street, I promise to donate 100 kronor a month to the Red Cross. Who will join in? How many? Look. How many people in here will donate 100 kronor a month if you manage 200 juggles and continue playing? I saw 30 hands. They're on camera, so they can't pull out. - I thought he was quitting. - It's planned in advance. - How do you know? - He messaged me earlier. What do you say? Okay. Okay! Come on. Two hundred. Juggles! Let's see... It can't be planned in advance. It's live. Let's support Eric! Good. Yes! - Five, six, seven, eight... - How many? Fifty, 51, 52! - Fifty-three, 54... - Fifty-six, 57! Kids, get up! Oh! - How many is that? - Kids, look at Uncle Eric! No! Good! Come on. Eighty-nine, 90, 91, 92, 93! Look, kids! No, not like that! Look out! Don't hit the wall! That still counts! It's looking really good. Back up! Good, that's great! And he's back. Where are we at now? One hundred sixty-one. Nice! Good! Watch out! One hundred seventy! Oh! - That still counts. - That still counts! - Where are we at now? - One hundred ninety. Two, three, four, five, six, seven, ninety-eight, ninety-nine... - Two hundred! - Two hundred! Two hundred! Two hundred! Two hundred! Wow! Eric Hansson! Oh, my God! Thank you. Two hundred juggles! Come, sit down. Wow! - Congratulations! - Thanks. - Hi. - Hi. I saw you on TV the other day. Wanna come practice? - No, I should be at work. - I'll drive. I told the boss you've got a funeral to attend. No one will question it. Should you really be driving this old heap? It looks like rain. - What's this? - You'll see. Eric! I thought we were going to the field. - Are you going somewhere? - You are. Let's see... passport. Toothbrush. Some clothes in case you get dirty. And I have your spare keys. Thanks for letting me stay. There we are. Good luck. Sorry, I forgot... A plane ticket to Las Vegas. - Vegas? - I thought it was time. - Don't start crying. - No. Go on and do your Vegas stuff. There's a conference at Caesars Palace for sports agents and managers. If you want to become a soccer agent, you might as well do it properly. Here's your ticket. Whatever... Oops! Go on, I'll be fine. Bengtsson! Let me see you moonwalk! Ah! Hey... Are you ready? - Yeah. - By the way, I'm quitting soccer. What?! It's time for a new dream. I'm done being benched. You said I was inspiring and now you're quitting? That's strange. Yeah, but it's not really about soccer. - What's this? - Tryouts for a five-a-side team. It's time to play for a real team. Who's the girl? She's a bit like Bengtsson. Similar personality. Hot cocoa? I'd love some. So you're not angry anymore? No, I'm not angry. I just thought we... knew what we wanted out of life. Suddenly I realized we didn't. Yeah, this was a bit sudden. You took the ball and ran with it, I guess. I went to the office. I could probably get my old job back. - Do you want to? - No. That's the thing. I don't want to. This is what I want. But I'm wondering what you want to do. You might want to become prime minister! We have to be able to talk about it even if that doesn't happen. Although I believe it might. So we should be prepared. You might need bodyguards. It's good for us to discuss it in advance. - When are you playing? - Any second now. Go on, then. We can have dinner afterwards. - I'd love to. - And talk some more. - Hi! - Hi. - So, you're Eric's coach? - No. Oh... So, what do you do? I don't really know. I'm going to think about it. What do you do? I think I'm going to become prime minister. Yeah, why not? You might wonder what society we'd have if everyone chased their dreams. But if for every 36-year old with soccer dreams, you get one sports agent, one prime minister and a young girl who stops sitting on the bench, that in itself must be worth 25,000 a month and some water in the basement. And anyway, 10,000 hours... there's a long way to go. Subtitle translation by: Sanna Arvidsson Milton
