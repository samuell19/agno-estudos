THE SKIPPERS OF THE KAMELEON Frog's eggs are disgusting, aren't they? And identical. I'll ask Dad again just to make sure. Why don't you try asking Dad and I'll try Mom. Right, then we'll have two chances. - Two boys, two chances. Hey, clodhoppers. There are lots of eggs overhere. Look what I found. I'll lend you my pole. No, it's much too far. - Go on, you can jump it. I know I can. In fact, I could do it anytime. Let's see you do it. - You first. All right. - No, this is our Sunday best. You get a guilder, if you do. - Let's see it. Okay, hold on. Right, hand over the pole. - I must be nuts. It's too easy, I should give it to you. Mom'll be mad if you fall in with those clothes on. I'm not going to. - You'll never make it. It's too far. Stop whining, it's a lot of money. - Are you jumping or what? Hold your horses. - Well, I don't have all day. I'll jump, don't worry. - Come on, yellow belly. Go, Sietse. Oh, what a shame. - I told you so, but you wouldn't listen. Come on out. Too bad, Hielke, but I'm proud of you. - I'm Sietse, you moron. What do I care? We might as well both be dirty. Give me the pole. You'll make it. Give it your best shot. This is going to cost me, I can feel it. - You know it. Darn it. What a shame. How did you manage that? Here, let me. - It's nothing, leave it. Where are they? - The little monkeys will be here soon. Atleast they're already dressed for church. Klinkhamer. - Hello, doctor. Come on out. Still, you're lucky. - How so? You're both excellent swimmers. - Say, why don't you go fly a kite? Now you. Yea, your turn. - What do you mean? You said you would jump too. - What gave you that idea? Well, you said you'd jump that. No, I didn't say that. You did too. - No, you didn't listen. I said: I could jump it anytime. But I never said I'd actually do it. Darn it. You've been stealing from the cookie jar again, you little pig. What's the use? Hi, Kees. - What's up? You little brat. - See you. So what have you been up to this time? I wouldn't know. How about you? - Me neither. We got wet just like that. - Yes, it must have been a local shower. How do you manage to make up those lies? Your parents won't be very pleased. Were your parents pleased with you? - I can't imagine, can you? Now you listen to me... This is incredible. Doggone it. We all know each other here. If you're in trouble, at least ten people are ready to help. Ain't that right? It's the strength of a amall community. I feel privileged to be the mayor here. Morning. - That'a Sygerdams and son. Very rich. - And very stingy. He owns all the land here, but he can't seem to part with his money... so he gave his son a lousy job on a pushertug. Which is probably why he's so rich. Everyone is dressed in their best on Sunday. I'm so sorry. - My dress. What have you done? Always up to something. Go on, beat it. It's the Klinkhamer kids. They're little terrors. I don't want to see you again today. - You're a disgrace. We're really very sorry. - And what good is that now? None at all, actually. Be quiet. - Well, I guess we'll be running along. Yes, have a good Sunday. Hi, Paulien. - Mrs Wijnstra. Hi, Hielke. Hi, Sietse. It's really sad that her father died. When we get a boat, we'll invite her. - Yes, good idea. Will you look at that automobile? - What does he want here? See that? - What? This. What a spoiled brat. - You bet. She must be from the city. Let go. Let go, I said. Grandma De Jong, what happened? Those hoodlums. Those hoodlums stole my purse. Are you all right? - Yes. Yes, I'm all right. I'm going to fetch the doctor. Does it hurt, Mrs De Jong? The hoodlums stole her purse. But I'll get them, Grandma De Jong. Did she break anything, doctor? - No, but she'll be needing stitches. Go home, your parents are waiting. I'll take care of her. What a cowardly act. - Any nausea? Grandma De Jong, if I catch them, I'll beat them to a pulp. Fine, Hielke. - I'm Sietae. I'm Hielke, but that's okay. - Klinkhamers. Let me see. This is Esther, our fosterchild from the city. She'll be staying with us for a few weeks. The fresh air will do her good. Let's go. I'll get my prayerbook. What's that disgusting smell everywhere? It's fertilizer. You'll get used to it. - I doubt it. More fresh air, I presume? Not again, that's twice in one day. - Gerben dared us to jump a ditch. Yes, yes, march upstairs, you two. And you can't come to church with us. How disappointing. - Mind your tongue. Go to your room. It's always the same. Move it. I'm Sietse Klinkhamer. And you? You can't meet a lady looking like that. Go wash up. You, too. Boy, oh boy. - This country air is insufferable. Mrs Klinkhamer. This is unheard of. Mrs Klinkhamer. - Not now, we must be going. Who hangs up clothes on a Sunday? - I do. That's notright, not on a Sunday. If you had a couple of boys like these you wouldn't say that. And why not? Because it's the sixth time this week and the second time today, that's why. Let's go. - But... We have to go, or we'll be too late. What a spoiled brat. - All the girls from the city are like that. How do you know? I just know, that's all. Mrs Klinkhamer, who hangs up clothes on a Sunday? And for everyone to see. It's unheard of. Hielke, I have an idea. Look at this. Jeez, who'd wear something like that? Look, here they come. What's going on? Countryfolk make a fuss over the smallest things. They're so provincial. What is it this time? There really is something going on. Quick, take all that down. This is absolutely disgraceful. And call the police. Rightnow, Wim. Would your lovely boys know anything about this? Why don't you check on them. - Yes, I'll check on them. Are you asleep? Know anything aboutthat? - What? Mrs Bleeker's laundry was hung up. Do you know anything about that? - No. Do you know what he means, Hielke? But it's absolutely disgraceful. - Yes, it's unheard of. Boys, this isn't right. You shouldn't do that. You think it's funny. - You do, you like the joke. No, I do not. They're fast asleep. Right. But then who did it? - A couple of farmhands maybe? Yes, I think so too, Margreet. I do. It was probably farmhands. Maybe it was Gerben. He's always pulling pranks. Cup of coffee, my dear? See that? - Of course, I saw it right away. isn't itfunny how we both feel the same things at the same time? Yeah, I know. I kind of like it. So did you ask Dad? - He says it's too expensive. And Mom? She thinks it's too dangerous. Look, there goes the movie star. Hi, eh... Joeke? - Wrong, the name is Sietse. Want to see the forge? - Sorry, I'm a little busy. I'm a little busy. Stupid cow. Show-off. Faster, it's taking forever. - In a hurry to get to the pub? What? Just make this thing go faster. - The engine will ocerheat. You're too stingy. You want to save on fuel. Just like your father. - What do you know? More than you think. So will you do it or not? Why you dirty... - Get off my boat. Whoa, thatwas quite a bang. I think it came from the lake. - Let's go look. Well, I think it must be shot to hell. - Yes, I'm afraid so. The engine split in two. It's beyond repair. I thought so. I'll let you hace it for 50. - What would I want with it? Buy it for us. - Yeah, fifty guilders is not that much. Fifty guilders is a lot of money, boys. - Come on. It's only 50 guilders. Please? - We really want a boat. Please? It's our chance. - Dad? All right, all right. I'll give you... 25 guilders for your boat. Thirty-five. Thirty. My last offer. Well, Boris? Thirty. For the boys. - We have a boat. Would you look under the car? I think something is loose. The car is getting old. - Sure. I'll have a look. We now have a news flash for you. A powerful hurricane on the North Sea is heading for our country. In England, it left a path of destruction. The massive storm has left 18 dead and more than 300 persons injured. The people in England are devastated by the hurricane... Well? - It's your steering mechanism. You should take care of it before it gets dangerous. How's tomorrow? - That's fine. Tomorrow then. Put it on mytab. Gentlemen, I don't like the looks ofthis. It's heading for us. Have people been warned? No, but I'll do that right now. Thank you. - You're welcome. The comics are funny. Sorry to disturb you, Mayor. - Have a cigar. No thank you, sir. I came to tell you that I spoke to fellow officers from neighboring villages. They're taking precautions against a hurricane... that's heading fort his country, especially our area. Let's wait and see what happens, it's a beautiful day. With all due respect, mister Mayor... but shouldn'twe take precautions, just in case? I appreciate your dedication, Zwart. - You're the best. But I don't think it's necessary to alarm the people just yet. Let's see how it decelops. If anything happens, I'll call you. Did I make myself clear? Have a cocktail and relax. - No, thank you very much. And take something off. Full uniform in this weather... Hey, Sietse, I'm all out of red. I can't really go on with green. I'm running out, too. Hey, boys, look at all the stuff I found. But no green. And no red either. - No. I know, let's mix them. - Then we're sure to have enough. That's a good idea, a very good idea. How are you holding up? Why does everyone I love die? I really miss them. Every time I go to bed, they're not there to tuck me in. When I wake up, they're not there. I dream about them. I am sleeping between the two of them... and they're smiling at me. But then I try to hug them... and suddenly they're gone. I'm scared, uncle. Scared of what? Of more pain. What do you mean? I don't know. I have this awful feeling. And I'm afraid I'll lose you as well. You won't. I'll always be with you. - That's what Mom and Dad said too. Why so mad? Because if I lose you, I won't have anybody. That's why. It won't happen. So you're not going to abandon me? - No. Never? - Never. I'll always be there for you. Down here or up there. But you don't believe in fairytales anymore. I was kissed by a pretty princess. I'm turning into a frog. Have you arrested them? - Who? The hoodlums, of course. The ones who robbed me. I'm afraid not. They're not from around here, they're from the city. Well, have a good day. It's too heavy to row, really. - Yeah, but we don't have an engine. It's so quietvit's eerie, don't you think? - Yeah, even the frogs are quiet. Hey, want a drink of water? Dad. Dad, look at that. Is it coming this way, Dad? - Yea, I'm afraid it is. Take our things back in. Easy, easy. Take it easy now. That's a good boy. Easy. Good boy. Are you sure about this? I wish you wouldn't go now. Don't worry, if I hurry I'll be in the office before it hits. I don't want you to go. Please don't go. I still have to amend a will. It can't wait, sweetie. Bye, princess. Don't be silly, girl. Come, let's go inside. Okay, I'll do that. Thanks, see you. It's headingt his way, over the Waddenzee to the coast and to Lenten. And Lenten is going to be hit very hard. Zwart, sound the alarm. The tornado is heading for our town. Did you hear me? Don't just stand there. Can you help me? Yea, of course. - What do you need? My uncle is... Inside, boys. It's too dangerous out here. You too, Esther. Go inside, hurry. Dad, please come inside. Dad, the boat. You have to tie up the boat. No, there's no time for that. Come inside, hurry. Not the boat. Please, not the boat. See that? Oh no. Dad. Boys, don't. It's much too dangerous. Dad, tell them. - We have to do something. They can help, dear. Come on, let's go. Be careful. For heaven's sake, be careful. Look, there's the car. Klinkhamer, over here. - We're coming. The door is stuck, I can't open it. The wheel has me pinned down. Look out. It's not working. I'm stuck. I'm pinned down under the wheel. Can we help? - I'm going to break the windshield. Out of the way, boys. Take cover. Look out. I'm pinned down by the wheel. - Let's pull together. One, two, three... - It's not moving. Pull, pull, pull. Together. Yes, I'm free. What's the matter? Has something happened, ma'am? My husband didn't come home. I don't even know if he ever made it to the office. I can't call him, because the telephone lines are down. We didn't sleep all night. Let me get my husband. Hielke. Dad. Zwart. Let's go home. I'm afraid Mrs Bleeker has to go to hospital for a while. I came to ask if Esther can stay with you for a few days. Yes, of course. No problem. - Stay as long as you like, Esther. Would you like some tea? - Thank you. I guess I should be nice to Esther. - You? I suppose you must mean 'we'. Show-off. You take it. It's time I bought a new one. How much? - It's free. Oh no, it's still worth something. Please, Evert. After all, you saved my life. The boys did that. They alerted me. Very well, it's theirs. - Really? Yes, she's all yours. That's a mighty nice boat you have. Boy, oh boy. Itlooks like a spotted pig. So are you going to put the carengine in the boat? Hold that. Boys, sandwiches. - Yummy. Thanks, dear. One, two. Pull. Together. One, two, pull. Very good. One, two, go. Pull harder, boys. One, two, pull. All right, let's go. Pull, will you? - Go on, pull. Harder, you won't hurt it. Come on. Okay, give it a try. Try again. It's working. It's running smoothly. - Yes. What are you going to call it? - It must have a name. We'll call it: The Hiesie. Yeah, Hielke and Sietse. Why's your name first? The Siehie. - That's a good name. The Siehie. Look, it's the Siehie. Hi, Doctor. - Afternoon. Is it working? Okay, enough. Your boat keeps changing color. Just like a lizard. No, what's that animal called? A chameleon. That's it. - Chameleon. We're the skippers of the Kameleon. Be careful, boys. - Yes. Are you coming, Esther? I will next time. Nice going. Come, let's find you something else to wear. Hi, Kees. Come here. Kees, come here. Okay, shall we? We might as well give it a try. All right. Are you ready for this? - Yes, ready. Here we go. We have a speedboat. We have a racing boat. Do you want a turn? - You bet. Here we go. - Okay. Let's go there. - All right. Jeez, it's fast. - Hey, look overthere. Jeez, it's a big one. Esther, we have to go into town. Watch the house, we won't be long. Have fun. Hey, baby, want to go for a ride? Aren't you feeling hot? - I know we are. Come, baby, get in the boat. - Leave me alone. Look. Don't be such a bore. Come with us... Baby. What's up? What are you doing? What we're doing? None of your business, farmhand. You have a cowardly theft on your conscience. Which one of them? - You robbed an old lady. Oh, did we rob an old lady? Let's go, the farmhands know too much. Esther, go for Officer Zwart. Too bad, baby. Better luck next time. Darn it. Their boat is fast. Hold it. Hold it, I said. Satisfied? Anything else, farmhands? Go, after them. What's up? We're out of fuel. Too bad Zwart was too late. - They're hoodlums. We'll get them, though. Want some milk? - Please. More? - No, that's enough. Thanks. Here, have some more coconutbread. - That'll do. Thanks. You'll want peanutbutter on that. - No more, please. Thanks. Have some chocolate sprinkles on it. I'll grab them. The hoodlums, I mean. You have a daughter after all. Make sure you clean everything. Do you have a boyfriend in the city? - Why? No reason. Well? I have two boyfriends. How is that? It's not true, really. - Oh, that's okay. I was kidding. I don't have a boyfriend in the city. - That's okay. I was kidding? - I got it, I'm not stupid. But why do you want to know? No reason. - Because. Because. Clodhoppers, want to make money? - Whatnow? You get a guilder if I can smash 5 eggs on your head. What's the catch? Five eggs on yourvbaboon heads, and you get a guilder. It's worth it. I need a good laugh, it's been too long. Well? Five eggs, you say? - Don't, he's having you on. Stay put. Go ahead. That's one. That's two. That's three. And that makes four. There, I think that's enough. That's a good boy. - What? You see? - You said five eggs. Yes, but I get to keep my guilders, because I only did four. See you. Creep. Idiot. Filthy pigfarmer. Hey, you. What did you do? - Call me 'Sir' if you forgot my name. You watch your mouth, because I know what you did this morning. This is a serious offence. - What's going on? I bet you didn't think I'd be on to you so soon, did you? But for a good police officer one clue is more than enough. Now where is the money? - You really want to know? Try the national treasury, MrZwart, they have loads of it. You think it's a laughing matter? Well, you're an ass. Only a fool would steal that money. - Right, not only are you insulting me... but I also don't know what money you mean. The notary public's money. - The notary public? You worked in the notary public's garden, is that correct? That's right. - You saw the money... and sneaked in through the garden, right? Come on, Zwart, you know I don't do things like that. So you won't confess. Take your coat off. This is outrageous. - Take the coat off. Eighthundred guilders is no laughing matter. Your pockets. This cannot be. I mean... the footprints indicate the house was entered from the garden. Was he wearing clogs? Right, I walk into the house and stomp, stomp, stomp all over the floor. But nobody hears me, so I take the money. Nice and easy. Yes, it must have been someone who wore shoes. I'm sorry. Put your coat back on. - Thank you. You're wearing shoes. I am indeed. Do you expect me to walk the streets on my socks? That's absurd. Were they pointed shoes, Zwart? - Pointed shoes? The ones the hoodlums were wearing. - Could be. Why don't you find that out first. I was just at the Wijnstra home. They were robbed as well. - What? Paulien's place? But they're poor. - And why wasn't I told? Doggone it. Wiedersehen, Kommissar. So, stamp licker, you almost went to jail. Ask her if she needs anything else. - I will. Have fun, Esther. - She will, don'tworry. Hey, clodhoppers. What kind of name is that? Kamel-leon. It's chameleon, you moron. - Bunch oflandlubbers. It's like a floating caboose. That's what it is. Paulien's dad died last year, and... Well, we tried to be there for her. That's sweet. It's just her and her mother now. They're very poor. Mrs Wijnstra takes in sewing to earn some money. Who'd rob them? Probably those hoodlums. That's Kees. He's in our school. - Come here, you. He has a sweet tooth. This goes on atl east three times a week. Hi, Paulien. - Hello, it's nice to see you. We heard you were robbed. - Yes. What did they steal? - Our savings and my father's watch. The creeps. But we brought you some goodies. Thank you. Did they leave any traces? Come on, let's go take a look. So what's your problem? What do you think? We want to get by. Can I ask you something? Hi, I'm Joost van Kampen. Gerben Zonderland. We're from a fraternity and we're looking for a place to hold parties. Preferably by the water. Do you know one? By the water? - Yes. Look, we're willing to pay. That's not a problem. Let me see. I know a place. Guys, reel it in. - Hurry. Sietse, come here. See that? It was made by a pointed shoe. Yes, it's the hoodlums. Didn't I tell you? It had to be. What's up? Talk to her. - Van Kampen here. Mrs Wijnstra. - We're looking for a building... to hold our meetings in and I hear your stables are empty. We would appreciate it if you would rent us yours. We'd pay you a handsome fee. - Mom, that's great. Well, we really could use the money. Especially after the burglary. - Look, we can give you an advance. Would three hundred guilders do? Hooray. Unload, men. We found tracks, Zwart. - Yes, tracks made by pointed shoes. Well, you did very well, Sietse. Hielke. - Pleased to meet you. I'm Sietse. Say, do you know how to swim? Swim? Me? - Yes. Like a champ. I don't have much time to swim nowadays. But once, many moons ago, I won a bronze medal at the Olympics. Really? Are you serious? - Yes. Can't you tell? Look, I have the build of a swimmer. I ran out of room to keep all my trophies and medals. I always won. It wasn't a challenge anymore, so I quit. Well, what do you know? Look at this. SWIMMING COMPETITION So that shouldn't be a problem for you. - No. Easy as pie. - In a matter of speaking. See you tomorrow then, Gerben. You and your big mouth, right? - Right. Hundred guilders is a lot of money. I just know you're going to win that money. How do I get out of this one? What's up? What are you thinking? I think we may have to split the money. - Why is that? Well, I have a plan. Butvno one can knowvaboutvit. - Whatvplan is that, Hielke? Yes, fill us in. There you are. - Thanks. Thank you. Ladies and gents, the competition is about to begin. Come see the show. The area's first big swimming competition is about to begin. Spread the word. I hope this works. Can you manage it? Okay, it's tied. Okay, let's go. I can't wait to see this, Gerben. A bronze medal at the Olympic Games. This must be a piece of cake for you. - You just wait and see, young man. Ladies and gents, it's about to begin. Get on your marks. And... - Get set. Van Kampen. Darn it. Robbed. I've been robbed. - What happened? I was out of strawberry, and these two boys... Those boys. Stop them. - Hielke, Sietse, do something. Sietse, the hoodlums. Stop, Gerben is still tied to us. Help. - Untie yourself. I can't do it. - Take your bathing suit off. Cover your willy. - Willy? My name is Gerben. Doggone it. I'm calling the Coast Guard. - You do that, Zwart. I'm afraid we're in the wrong waterway. I guess we should turn around then. - I guess you're right. Are you all right? - Idiot. Turn around. Let's check it out. Hey, kids. Overhere. Help, help. - Yeah, help us. Please. I can't swim. Well. What shall we do? We can't really let them drown. - Help, I can't swim. HAIL TO THE HEROES Well then. And what do we say now? We'll never do it again. We'll necerdo it again. We'll never do it again. - We'll never do it again. That's right. Ladies, gentlemen and respected citizens. I am pleased you came out here today to celebrate... a very special event. This morning I received a letter from the queen. In the letter she asks... that I present medals of honor to two young gentlemen. We all knowt hem... Where are they? They're awarded a medal for their bravery... and for saving two young men from drowning after an accident... that could have ended in tragedy. We can be proud of these two boys. They are a credit to our community. He should know. - You said it. There they are. It is with pleasure that I invite them up here: Sietse and Hielke, the skippers of the Kameleon. Good work, guys. Have fun. Can I have an ice cream for my throat? - Of course. There you are. - Thanks. Ladies and gentlemen: Hail to our heroes. Which one do you like best? I haven't decided yet. I bet you can't do it. What do we get if we make it across? - Yes, what do we get? The one who makes it... will get... a kiss. Okay. - Deal. You first. - No, you first. Well? I'll go first, as usual. Your turn, show-off. Do you like her? Yes, and you? Okay, who goes first? You decide. You can go first, Hielke. No peeking, show-off. Finished? Okay, my turn. Finished? Come on, let's go. Yes, let's go.
