[MUSIC PLAYING] [DISCO MUSIC PLAYING] Draft beer here, please? BARTENDER: Coming right up. [APPLAUSE] Your taxi's here. Let's go. Intan-- Ready? Intan! Hey! Rachmad! What's going on? He's annoying Miss Yanti. Be careful who you fight with. So you want to be a hero? Hey Sam, what's going on here? Oh, he was bothering a guest. Miss Yanti. OK, OK. All my guests are kings. I was not bothering her. I just said hello and they jumped on me. My friend, you must pardon my boys. And as for Yanti, since you're a pal, she works here. I'll make a date for her to see you. Oh here, I'll give you her number. Como, take care of the injuries and clean up here. OK. And you, get back to your post. OWNER: And as for Yanti, since you're a pal, she works here. I'll make a date for her to see you. Oh here, I'll give you her number. Enjoy your stay, sir. Here Thanks a lot. Yeah. hello. I'd like to have an outside line, please. 8-7-2-5-1-3. Thank you. [PHONE RINGS] Hello. Yes, I'd like to make a date with one of your girls, if I might. I'm glad to help. Oh, Yanti. That girl has just come back. Maybe you'd like someone else? Oh, I've heard so much about Yanti. Could you send her later? Regence, room two. All right, the price is very reasonable. Goodbye then. How long will you be in the village? Only a little while. You know my school vacation is almost over. Hm. You know I'll miss you so much. I want you to write every day. Come on. You're my girl. I'll miss you. You know I will always be thinking of you. And you must wear my ring, my love, and be true. When are you going back? Monday. [KNOCK AT DOOR] Hello. RACHMAD: Good evening. Come in. Intan, where did you go? I suppose you know I've been looking for you. You can't run away from me. What did you do with the ring I gave you to wear before you went back to school? Many bad things have happened to me in the past. You loved a different girl. But now you must reserve me like everybody else. Don't you ever dare talk to me like that. How could you do this to me? I loved you, and you lied to me. You never came back. I waited for you in Bandung. And finally, I gave up and moved to Jakarta. Oh, you don't know how many things I've been through. I did go back. And then one day, my father was clearing the irrigation for our field. It had been blocked intentionally. That same morning, Japra, the landlord, approached my father. [SHEEP BLEATING] Damn it, what are you doing? This is the last straw. I've told you before to leave the water and make do with what you've got. But I need it for my fields, this water. I couldn't care less. Maybe you ought to think again about my offer and get out. If you like a peaceful life and a happy family, you'll stop being so stubborn. All of the rice fields around here belong to me. Why are you holding out? I'm not afraid of you. And I won't sell out to you. So take your hooligans and get out of here. This is your last chance. I won't sell for nothing. I love my land. [THUNDER STRIKES] [KNOCK AT DOOR] You know the simplest way out. Sign this and we'll let you be. And take this cash for your land. Don't bully me! Papa, papa! Papa! Papa! Papa! Papa! [GUNSHOT] Intan! Intan! You bitch! Let me go! Let me go! No! Help! Help! You wait outside. Good looking girl. Very pretty. Quick. OK. Old man, you should have taken this. Now make it look like a robbery. Clean the place out. And I got a high school virgin for my bonus. Twice. I like this job. Come on. [MEN CHUCKLING] [GROANING] Mom! Mama! Mama! Don't leave me! Brother! Iman! Iman! Oh no! My little Iman. Papa. Papa! Papa! Papa! That's why I didn't return to Bandung. I was ashamed. And I knew you wouldn't want me back after what had happened. Then a man named Tarland brought me to Jakarta. He seemed like a nice man. He took me to a big house. He said it belonged to his aunt. OK. But what is this? It might be better if you didn't fight with us about this. After a while, you'll like your work here. And you'll make more money here than you will in the factory. You're lovely enough to please any man. So relax and face facts. You'll like it. Give her to me tonight. Tomorrow she'll see with different eyes. Tammy, were you escaping again? Yes Well then, teach her a lesson. This new one needs attention. Come on! Come on! Scream if you like, my dear. No one will hear you. [DOOR OPENS] Consider this your own house. You will be very happy here. This is my sister, Lucy, and Bondon. What's your name then? Tini. Martini. She's new in town and wants interesting work. LUCY: Is that so? I'll help you. Move it, come on, get up. Get on your feet! If we can still surprise you girls it means you're good for business. We don't want you lying down, girls, unless it's to make us some money. Get them. Please have mercy. We can take you to heaven, we can send you to hell. Welcome to your new home. Do you want the wild one? Well, be my guest. Yeah? Go on! Don't leave any marks. Bring them to me when you're done. You take that one. I'm alone in the world and completely lost. Oh, I hope you understand. I will repay them. That is my mission. And my goal. But why didn't you come to me for help after the death of your family? Did you think that I would turn you away? You must have been terribly frightened. But even so, you should have gone to the police. They would have been able to help you. Those men would be in jail now if you wanted. The man who paid them has much power. And you and I know you wouldn't want me any more I'm impure. I want to make them sorry. To make them suffer. I am ready to do what I have to. And I'm not afraid to die. They are monsters, not people. You may be sure I'll never stop until I'm revenged. But aren't you trying to burn the sun? Intan, you could be burned worse than they will be. I will not give up. A promise must be kept. I have made myself a vow. I promise you, we'll do this. You'll need a man to help you. Time's up. This is to my house. Don't lose that key. We'll see now if my plan works out. If it doesn't, you can hide. Intan, I will do everything in my power to make you free. I will talk to Bandun. And where there's a will, there's a way. OK. [GIGGLES] [KNOCK AT DOOR] Who's there? FEMALE VOICE: It's me. Oh, sorry. I didn't mean to disturb you. I didn't bring these up before because it's real busy and the washing machine is broken. Would you like to wash up? Sure. Welcome. Hi there. Hi there. I have business. Now, now, you must not be too greedy. Others should be able to enjoy Yanti too. After all, she's our superstar here. If it's that important to have this lady serve your needs only, the Madam here and I are happy to hand her over. Yes, but you must offer us a small gratuity. Yes-- something you could not possibly pay. Say, $20,000. Monopolies are for the rich. Be smart and find a cheaper call girl. What's wrong, honey? Oh, nothing. I'm jealous of whoever you're looking at. Well listen, could you turn right up ahead here, please? Hey! Yanti! Where are you going? [CARS HONKING] COMMUTER: Quit staring at the women and move your car, stupid! INTAN: Stop here. Taxi! Keep the change. Where's that girl? She took another cab. Blast it! May your marriage be very happy and long. Thank you. God bless. Thank you very much. -Good luck. -Thank you. Good luck. Congratulations. -Thank you. -[INAUDIBLE] INTAN: Thank you. I want you know how happy I am that you married me, even after what happened. Yeah. I'd be a fool to pass you by. That's OK. We won't discuss it again. I'd like you to stay with grandpa at my home. You can stay there until it's safe. My family will like you. It's better I go to the police. Oh, Yanti won't be able to get away with this. OK, I want to follow those two and teach them a lesson. Rachmad! Let me out of here! Help! Rachmad, watch out! [INDISTINCT CHATTER] All right, let's be quick. Hurry up! So you actually ran away with him, you little fool. He was my guest. You got him in a fight. How does that look? But you won't be punished if you help us. Now Yanti, you better listen to what I say. Tell him this, not to so much as mention one word to the police. You'll go to the hospital with two guards and give him the message, or you'll be very sorry. And another thing, I know that you would miss him. Do what I say, or he'll be dead. I'm so glad you haven't talked to the police. If you had, oh I just don't know. They would be so cruel. They're such terrible people. I plan to tell the police. But I can't do it yet. Not until I'm sure about you. Oh, Intan, now I hate them too. I will stay here and put them in jail. You must go ahead and hide with my grandfather in the village. I love you with all my heart. You must trust me, Intan, and go. I'll follow you in a few days. And then we can live together in peace. That part is impossible. There are two men out there watching. Pardon me. Oh, yes. Do you see that space below? Mm hm. Could I ask a favor? Yeah. I will go. But my heart stays with you. I love you. Wait a second. Oh, yes sir? Do you have a match? Sorry, I don't smoke. OK. What is the problem? Where did that visitor go? Shh. She's already left. You must keep your voice down. This man is sedated. I must ask you to leave him alone. Did she get away? Come on. Thank you, miss. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [HORN BLARES] [KNOCK AT DOOR] Do you have to go, huh? You two are stupid, letting a woman get away like this. Make a complete search of the area. I'm putting the blame on your heads. We looked all over, and that's why we're so late. BANDUN: Send Freddie in. Get out of here. Yeah, boss. I have something for you. Ask Tarland. Whatever's happened to Yanti, he must know. You are welcome. Um, you are a woman who has had a terrible time. A lot of pain and heartache. And now, you will rest. And that's the best medicine. If you are determined to defend the truth, I will teach you all my knowledge and that will help you. I'm an old and smart man. Yes, I think we'll get you started tomorrow. [KNOCK AT DOOR] I thought you said your wife was in Bandung? She is. I don't know who that could be. [KNOCK AT DOOR] Who's there? FREDDIE: It's me. Oh, Freddie. FREDDIE: Come on out here for a second. Uh, I was just collecting my commission, you know. Making the most of it before I give it over to Bandun. Yeah, come here. Yanti's escaped. Hm? She went to her village. I'll follow her. We need your help and your men. The minute you find her, be sure to call Bandun. This could be bad if the police knew. Put the whole thing into my hands. Because if I have my say, Yanti will never leave you again. What did you do with Yanti? Come on! There's no chance for you to win. All we want is some information, and you'd be a fool to keep this up. We don't really have much to fight about. You give back Yanti, and we'll forget the whole thing. Oh. I'm not a fool of her anymore. Looks like we've all been abandoned. Let me tell you, that whore means nothing to me. I was afraid you'd give me that kind of an answer. Look here, boy, this is nobody else's business. Me and my friends are going to be watching you. And if we think that you called the police, we'll kill you both in a minute. RACHMAD: They are always watching me. I see them everywhere. So things are still insecure and I can't follow you yet. But I want to see you so much. Don't go anywhere, please Intan. Stay in my grandfather's house. We must be patient if we're going to be together. I love you, Intan, and can't wait to see you again. Rachmad. Intan! You're a good student, Intan. But you must be very careful now that you know these things. [HUMMING] Intan? Yes, Grandpa? If we catch some fish, will you cook them? Mm hm. Meet me at the river. See you there. OK, Grandpa. [COMBAT SOUNDS] Intan! Enough! Good work. [CHUCKLES] Intan, these men are my students. [ALL CHUCKLE] INTAN: My dear Rachmad, your grandfather is a great teacher. Thank you for sending me here. I feel almost ready to return to my village and then, when my past is buried, we will have our whole future together. I love you, Rachmad, and soon I will see you again. I am safe and happy. Love, Intan. You can only use the methods I have taught you to fight for justice or to help and protect. To use your power for any other purpose, this is bad. I won't. Ours is the path of peace. You must never kill a man unless you have to. Yes, I see. I only wanted to hurt those men to get even. But now, you know, I'm stronger than they are. If it's all right, I have some business in my home town. It should only take a day. --[CHUCKLES] And when you come back, bring Rachmad. [HORN BLARING] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] THUG: Let's cut her off. [CHUCKLING AND WHISTLING] Oh my. Please stop and let me through. Yanti, you know we missed you. [COMBAT SOUNDS] I'm stuck! I'm stuck. Yeah. We were able to figure out who was responsible, but we needed proof. And with your people dead, and you gone to the city, we had no witnesses. We couldn't do anything. Intan, now, don't worry about yourself. You'll be all right. Thanks for your help. Where will you be? I'll be staying with Raju. Look, get it. I'm sorry I haven't been able to be a better hostess. But I'm alone here every day. You know Japra? He wants to take away our land. It's all we own in the world. Pookin has had to run away and stay at my parents' place. They're coming! Isam! Hey honey, where's your husband? He's out for the day. Get in the house and wait for me there. Ah, so it's you again. --[CHUCKLING] I'm glad that you remember me. Her first love. [ALL LAUGHING] You must have thought I was good. She's come back for more. You're going to like it. Come on and let me kiss those pretty lips. [COMBAT SOUNDS] Ass holes! Get after her! Come on, keep her trapped. Don't let her get away. Get over there. We'll teach her a lesson she'll never forget. Get her! Get her! Cut them off. Now come across. Attack her. Capture her and bring her to me. Come on! Watch where you're going! Raju, your baby. Damn you, stop! Damn it, stop! This is it. Now's the time. Go on, all of you. All of you, move! Pin her down! And now, you bastard. Tell me who killed my parents and brother. We were ordered. Whose orders? Talk for your life. Jopra. I thought so. I'm going to take you with me to talk to the police. And you know just what to say. JOPRA THUG: Sir! Mr. Jopra! What is it? I'm sorry, sir. We failed at our job. It wasn't our fault. You big ape. I said it wasn't our fault. A woman helped them. She was fierce. A woman? Yes, she hurt me. I don't want to hear about it. I'm going to give this job to you. And you take care of the whole thing. Yeah, OK boss. Smile now. I'm home, and tonight, I have something very special just for you. Come on. It's only a woman? Yep, that's all. No problem. But you have to pay up front. Oh, yes sir. I'll pay. Here's your money, we're glad to pay it. With many thanks. Many, many. Ah yes. [GIGGLES] So, Intan. I want you to tell me everything that happened, because I was with the children. Oh. I was just practicing what my grandpa taught me. Are you hungry? No, not really. Some milk? No, thank you. Oh, it's so good. I like it best when it's heated up. I'll go do that now. Mm hm. [MUTTERING] I hope this is the end of Jopra, but something tells me I'll have to visit him soon. But don't you worry, you'll be all right. And you be quiet, you little one. [RUSTLING] What's going on here? And who's shaking that picture? Someone must be hurting Intan! Milk for Isam? No, Intan, thank you. He's had his dinner. My god, how did that get in the milk? Ah yes, someone must be helping her. But I'll succeed this time. You'll see. [CHUCKLES] [MUTTERING INDISTINCTLY] You go to sleep. I'll stay up a while. OK. [GASPS, STARTLED] [HISSING] [BABY CRYING] Stay calm. Yes. My god! [BABY CRYING] I don't believe it! Thanks be to God. Intan is now safe from the evil. This must be the work of Jopra. I'll have to leave you and the baby for a while before he does something else. You wait with the neighbors. Intan, would you like to wear one of my dresses? Yours is dirty. All right, that would help. Here you go. So, at last I have you alone. But listen, if you've lost your virginity to anyone else, what your father owes will be doubled. Now, let's see. Hey, where are you going? To take a leak. What happened? Oh god, we failed! Are you kidding me? He's dead, and smoking. You, go get the guard. I ran away. I mean, there he was, dead. Hey you guys, come here! What? What the hell? [COMBAT SOUNDS] Where are you going? Out of her way. Me too. Now give me all those lists you robbed. Just a moment. Speak up now! I'll get them. Here they are. [GROANING] I'm safe now. And so are you. You can go home now. Just look at these. I'm taking these to the police. Your papa won't have to pay any more money. Look out! Now he is gone, and we have justice. [KNOCK AT DOOR] Tell me why you're here. Aren't you alone? You know better than that. There are men out there watching me. Oh, I know. But I was very careful. I waited until they were gone. They've been here all day. But now we can be alone. Hm. But are you sure it's all right? Sure. Nobody knows I'm with you. it's all right, since we're husband and wife. [GIGGLES] [MOANING] This is my last night in Jakarta. Tomorrow night it's back to Kuala Lumpur. Oh, I thought you looked Malaysian. Really? Have you been there? Uh huh. I had a business there. It went bankrupt, but I make good money now. And I kind of like it. Could you get that. So uh, you enjoy your work? Oh yes. I always get a lot of exercise. And I really like that. Ah. I'd like to get you a present. Well, what I'd really like is in your pocket. You woke me up to look at this? I know it's late. I need cash. Mm hm. She's got a cute ass. And you? You just keep on bringing them in and you'll do fine. Oh, she's lovely. Another fine catch. And may I ask where you've been? Oh, just trying to mend my ways. Oh-- married, aren't you? My dear, that was really quite foolish. We had all that trouble, and now you're back here with us. It's really better. Here, you're paid every time you're used. Husbands take you for granted. This one's new? You'll always be our superstar. I won't let you beat me up again. I've come back to teach you a lesson. We'll see about that? [COMBAT SOUNDS] Lulu [GROANING] All right. This is it. Don't move. Hold her! [MEN CHUCKLING] I want you to kill her. And make it hurt. [COMBAT SOUNDS] What's going on? Are they armed? [COMBAT SOUNDS] Pick me up. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] What happened to my shoes? I had them just an hour ago. Where did they go? Oh good. I'm not going to jail without my shoes. It's heroin. Take me in. Intan! What are you doing? I took the law into my own hands. I can't do that. I want to stand trial. Take me in. We trust you. Come along in the wagon, OK? Come on. Move along now. I will wait. You have made me very proud. I did what I had to. I love you, Rachmad. Oh, my Intan. I love you. [MUSIC PLAYING]
