Well I was just in the bath, dripping wet. Come in, have a look around and just give me a minute. Sorry everything'’s such a mess. I'’ve been trying to get packed for days. It'’s quite comfortable actually. Are you a student? Yes. [woman] Then it will be very convenient for you, just a step away from the campus. Of course it'’s bound to go very quickly. There have been four or five people in to have a look already. I'’d love to keep it myself, but this friend of mine needed a roommate, and in a weak moment, I said yes. Oh, my name'’s Pamela, Watson May. I'’m sorry, I didn'’t get your name. Evergood, Ian Evergood. Well, how do you do? Come, let me give you the grand tour. The place is quite nice actually, but I suppose it'’s hard to say isn'’t it with all this muck in the way. Oh, no no no, don'’t give it a second thought. It'’s a terribly blood bore, shifting from one flat to another. The bed'’s in here. Oh yes, quite. The rent is 45 dollars. Quite. Well, that'’s the lot. Do you happen to know what time it is by any chance? It'’s just gone 4:30. Oh, good lord. I had no idea it was so late. Where does the day go? It'’s time for tiffin already. Tiffin? Yes, one'’s early upbringing dies hard I suppose. Actually, tea time is one of the things I miss most in this country. Don'’t you? No, not really. I suppose I could give you a cup. Well, if you'’d like. [Ian] I say, you wouldn'’t have something to nibble on, would you? Help yourself. I must say you don'’t quite seem like the academic type. Oh, the clothes? I'’ve been on a bit of a hunting trip. Bears and wolves, mostly. How exciting. I must say it would be rather dull for you back here, after all that. Not necessarily. Still it is a bit strange, you know, to find oneself back after all this while. Pretty girl, apple, kettle on for tea. It'’s very Proustian, actually. The Madeline cookie sort of thing. That'’s just it. The alchemy of the senses. So incredibly precise. That divine scene when Swan meets Odette for the first time. Marvelous. Look, I think I'’ve got to-- An English girl, soft. All creamy skin. Oh please, stop it. Ooh, a little golden hair, right there. Oh no, please Ian, stop it. I'’m gonna move you, baby. No! [tea kettle whistling] Oh! You'’re disgusting! [kettle whistling][moaning] The kettle, let me get the tea! [Ian] Fuck the tea. You'’re an animal. You'’re name isn'’t Evergood. [Paps] No, it'’s Gnossos Pappadopoulis, but you can call me "Paps."

You don'’t think in terms of world politics and hemispheric problems, [audience laughing] when somebody is banging on your window. [Murray] Baby that'’s tough, it'’s boss, and I hope that you did TCB, take care of business right there. Crizz-azy. [Eisenhower] I'’m optimistic enough to say this. As long as I'’m able I'’m going to carry on just exactly as I have in the past and from there on, it'’s in the lap of the gods and that'’s that. [people talking] Okay, who was the Green Hornet'’s Filipino companion? [woman] Cato. [man] He was a Jap to being with, but after Pearl Harbor, they had to cool it. I remember we-- God damn. Where the hell did you come from? The world is round, baby. You know you'’re supposed to be dead. [woman] Is that Gnossos? Hey, how you doing? I'’m Jack, heard a lot about you. I can'’t believe it. You'’ve been resurrected. This calls for a celebration. My treat. I hit it big in Vegas, but they paid me off in silver dollars, and I'’m getting a hernia carrying them around. Four bottles of beer. So? What'’s happening? You ain'’t missed a damn thing. Hey listen man, now that I'’m back, the combination'’s reunited. Let'’s see if we can put a few things together. Hey, you gonna stay? You know it baby, too piercing out there. So I sped for New Mexico. I hung out with a bunch of Boy Scouts for a while. The second night I was there, the Pachuco showed up. A couple of 12-cylinder white Packards, radios blaring, lights bouncing all over. They'’re weird-looking. Pig eyes. Hair all slicked back. And that mixed blood Mexican-Indian-White. They'’re really juiced, you know? And nasty. About 15 of them. They gathered around this one kid who was tending the fire with a big sash across his chest. Eight million merit badges on it. They just stood there. Not even looking at him, cleaning their nails with their switchblades. Three of them, they came over to me, they squatted down, and one of them says, real soft, "Stay put mother, or maybe we cut an ear." Man, was I scared. They stripped this Boy Scout right down to the pubes, they peeled him like an orange. Poor son of a bitch never said a word, he just, whimpered. They staked him to the ground with tent pegs, and then they burnt him all over with cigarette butts. The one who was doing most of the actual burning, I remember. He kept rubbing the kid'’s forehead and saying soothing things, like to a puppy. He kept it up even when he finally put the last cigarette butt out in his ear. The kid finally threw up. Just lying there, choking on it. Sort of blew a trip for me. [birds chirping] I'’m back. Well, yes you are, aren'’t you? There was a rumor you were dead. You didn'’t believe that, did you? No, not really, Gnossos. Yeah well, anyway I'’m back. How come you didn'’t answer my letters? There really was nothing for me to say at that point. Look Calvin, you bugged? Not at all. Should I be? You said I shouldn'’t go. All I said was, you wouldn'’t find what you were looking for, out there I mean. Look, it was an experience. But not the right one.All right, all right. I thought it was out there, so I went and I looked, and it wasn'’t. So I came back. And now? I figure I'’ll settle in like you. Nice wife, home in the woods. Live off the academy. There'’s more to it than that, Gnossos. I know, I haven'’t given up on the rest, I just gotta get the externals cooled out first. I gotta get organized is all. Fine, you let me know when you'’re ready for the next step. I'’ve got a class to teach. Come on, walk along with me. You won'’t have any problem being readmitted, will you? No, it'’s all fixed. I'’ve just got to get Oeuf to okay my forms. Ah yes, I think you'’ll find him about the same. Yeah, I figured. There'’s nothing more compulsive than a compulsive con artist. Oeuf'’s not so bad, he just wants to be loved, you know. Yeah, you know I had a dog like that once, but he never became a dean. In other words, you'’re right back where you started from. Now look Calvin, it wasn'’t a complete waste of time. I mean I saw a lot of things. Tell me about New Mexico. There'’s really nothing much to say. Oh come on now, Gnossos I know you. You have a couple of good stories to tell. You know I gotta get these papers down to the bursar'’s office today. That'’s the trouble with our world, Gnossos. People like you and me at the mercy of the bureaucrats. Right. So if you just whip off a signature, I could take it down there right now. We'’ll have our little chat some other time? When you'’re not so rushed. What about Tuesday? We could have dinner. I'’ll tell you the truth Oeuf, I'’d rather not. Oh? Nothing personal. I just don'’t want anybody messing with my head right now. So would you mind signing that lousy paper, already? [class bell ringing] Paps? Hey, Fitzgore. I heard you was dead. I heard you got eaten by a shark in San Francisco, or something. Hey man, does that sound like my kind of scene? No, it was all over the campus. I must say you'’re looking very sharp these days. I mean you got a whole new image. No, all the brothers have to wear ties during rush week. Yeah, impress the new membership. They got me on the committee for the rush luncheon. You'’re gonna kill the fatted calf? No, we'’re gonna have steak. Hey, is there anything in the bylaws excluding Greeks? Come on Paps, give me a break. Relax, Gorzy, they'’re gonna love me. They may even make you president of the house for bringing me. Gnossos Pappadopoulis. Danke Schoen, Erie, PA. Tom Dean, Chicago. Dave Fanning, Rochester, New York. Hey, what'’s up, Gorzy? Hi, I'’d like you to meet my buddy, Paps. Paps, this is Fred Krebs from the Inter-fraternity Athletic Committee. Great, it'’s good to have you down. It'’s nice to be down, Fred. Thanks, Fred. You mean, you'’re starting already? Oh man, when'’s dinner? [man] But I tell you one thing, I called her up. And I'’m not giving her number out to anybody. Da, Gnossos? Name'’s John Makys, with a Y. Guys call me Makes. Well, Gnossos is the way we pronounce it. But old Gorzy calls me Paps. Yeah, old Gorzy, he'’s quite a guy. He'’s done a whole lot for the house. Yeah, well that'’s the way Gorzy is. Yeah, good old Gorzy. That Gorzy, he really knows what'’s going on, huh? Hey, he tells me you'’re a transfer student. Yeah, Yeah, old Gorzy. Yeah.Hey, Makes. Hey, what do you say, Ace? [muffled] Paps, these are two more of the brothers. Larry Albright, Cleveland. Nice to meet you. John Moore, Chicago. How are you? What are you in? Astronomy. You know a little celestial mechanics type thing. I hear it'’s a real gut. How'’d you happen to get into astronomy? What, are you kidding? For the money.

Are you sure? I mean have you actually seen him in the boat? What is the matter with you? Nothing. Everything'’s cool. Ace. Oh, now here comes Agneau. He'’s very influential. Be nice. Sure. Okay? Gorzy, where have you been keeping yourself? Ah, Byron, I'’d like you to meet Paps. A pleasure Paps. How'’s your ass, Ace? How do you like the house? I think it'’s terrific. Well, look if there'’s anything I can do for you, just let me know. Byron'’s the man to talk to. Well what are you staring at my hair like that for? At your hair? Yeah. I mean you were staring at my hair, does it bother you? Hey, I think they'’re going in to dinner. Wait a minute, you find my hair peculiar, is that it? No no no no no. Dinner, Paps? Steak? [droning hum] [whispering] Is that you? [humming] Jesus. Hey is everything okay, Gnossos? Yeah, it'’s fine. Sensational. What'’s that sound you'’re making? Oh, you mean "hmmm"? Oh, well that'’s a little Indian thing I do, my mantra, you know I try to get it in after meals, it sort of helps the digestion. Really? Wards off the old monkey demon. Eh, Wong? Sorry, Ace, I didn'’t hear you. He'’s a little juiced. By the way Paps, something I wanted to ask you. Well, were you gonna ask me a question, or are you coming on. I don'’t follow you. Come on Byron, you know what I'’m talking about. I mean, are you a queer, or what? What? You think-- He'’s a fantastic put-on artist, I warned you guys, right? What are you smoking? What is that? You know, faggots can be useful, productive members of society, as long as they keep their goddamn hands to themselves. Okay, let'’s go. [Paps chanting "Om"] You know what I'’m talking about. Eh Wong, huh? You mark my words gang, He may be the house mascot now, but in 10 years-- zoom-- back to Peking! A commissar. Just a little, you know... There'’s just too much shit out there. From now on, I'’m just gonna lay out, and stay cool. You live longer that way. It just seems longer, that'’s all. No, man. There'’s a good life to lead here. You just stay immune, cultivate your own garden. Yeah, that'’s the only way, believe me. Look, I'’ve seen the rest of it. You know something? You sound just like my great-granddaddy. He'’s a 187 years old, and he comes off the same bullshit you do. Hey, you'’re getting very salty, old Heff. Boy, I can see I came back in the nick of time. Not the way you talkin'’. I mean like, I'’m gonna be movin'’, and you'’re gonna be sittin'’ right here on your ass. So it'’s only natural that we gonna wind up in two different places. In the meantime, let'’s get this son of a bitch home. Sure, baby. It'’s on its way. [laughing] [crashing] [dog barking][laughing] So then, you must be Mister Papadapalup? More or less. We are the neighbors next door. I am George Rajamuttu, and this is my lovely wife, named Irma. Oh yeah, how do you do? Rather well. Some of the courses though are quite difficult, isn'’t it? George is studying Hotel Administration. Yeah, me too. I'’m sure we'’ll get along very well indeed. I ought to warn you though, I have this thing about noise. You don'’t like it, of course. No, I make it. [birds singing] [airplane overhead] [Pap] How long'’s it last? [older man] It lasts five or six hours. Then you start to come down. It lasts quite a while longer, but not so intense. So we ought to take it now, I guess? Now or later. Whenever you like. Might as well be now. Beth? [light jazz music] Is that it? What do you do, just swallow it down? That'’s all. You really shouldn'’t take it unless you'’re sure you want to. Why not? The sooner I get hip, the better. It'’s sake. Take a sip to wash it down. [light jazz music] It doesn'’t look like much. [Calvin] Microcosm and macrocosm. I'’ll bear it in mind. [dramatic piano music] I don'’t feel anything. Be patient. A little in the stomach. That part goes away in a few more minutes. Oh. Thought it was the sake. I went out in the desert. [bright jazz music] To see the sun come up. And sure enough there it was, only it wasn'’t. It was a hydrogen bomb. You'’re gonna really spook me, man. It turns out there'’s always a worm in the image. [bright jazz music] [jazz, louder and wilder] [Beth] How are you feeling? Beth? Can I get you anything? No, that'’s all right, I'’m fine. [monkey screeching] [Beth] That'’s just a painting. You saw it before. Remember? Look, it just cut off its own head. [screeching] I still don'’t understand it. Just tell me what it'’s about. [crickets chirping] It'’s very simple, really, once you master it. The idea is to able to dwell in alternate forms. If a bird flew past, I would take it within me, and fly over rivers. If a stone waited in the desert, I would enter its fiber, and feel the wind etch my features. You lose what you are, and go into other things. All I get is heat. No light. You have to be patient, Gnossos. It takes time. [gospel music] [man] Hello, I'’m Father Pooty. You called about last rights. [man] Yes please, come right in, Father. It'’s my friend, I'’m afraid he'’s very sick. [gospel music] What? What'’s up? What are you? You see, Father? He'’s been like that ever since last night. Kept babbling about demons, and crossing himself, asking for a priest. What does the doctor say? He refuses all medical assistance. He only has faith in, you know. Well yes but, I think that a phone call to the infirmary-- It'’s no use, Father. I'’m afraid he'’s very single-minded. Father? Father? Father? Fix me up Father. I am a sinner, and my immortal soul is in danger. I am moved, my son, that you have sought the blessings of the church, but we must not negate the value of secular medicine, and I think that a doctor-- Butchers. Atheists. I know what these doctors do. They cut you open, and they look inside for a soul. And when they don'’t find one, they say, ah no soul. Maybe a pancreas, but no soul. But I'’ve got one, Father, don'’t I? Why of course you do, my son, of course. Of course you do, just comfort yourself. Here, Father. Thank you. Yes. Son of a bitch... He, he just wanders a little. I do think a medical opinion is called for here. [moaning] Rest yourself, my son. [speaking Latin] Amen. [speaking Latin] What? The sins of the feet. Of the feet? They carry one to sin. [Latin] Amen.

Well, we might roll around a little but, this is the general vicinity. [birds singing] And the only effective solution, as I see it, is to make the Executive Committee, and not the Steering Committee, our official representative at all future sessions of the Student Faculty Board. Sure, that'’s because you'’re in the Executive Committee. Mister Chairman, I believe I still have the floor. [Juan] It'’s simply a question of which group is closer to the realities of the situation. There are no ulterior motives, Mister Rosenbloom. [woman] Mister Chairman? If I can'’t talk to him, I don'’t want him to talk to me. Mister Chairman, Mister Chairman, may I make a motion? We'’re debating a previous motion. -I move-- -Out of order, sit down lump. Would you shut up? I move that we pass a resolution-- Lumpers, you'’re out of order. But I haven'’t finished. To meet with someone in the faculty senate and just explain it to them, because I don'’t think they know what our position is, so I mean, how can we negotiate with them if they don'’t know what we want? As long as we have no actual power to back up our position, negotiations are a farce. That'’s precisely why we have to reassign the responsibility to a group that'’s more-- Hey, nobody yielded to you, either. On a point of order. All right please, let'’s try and follow the rules of procedure. The motion on the floor now, is whether or not to empower the Steering Committee to make binding agreements without a vote of endorsement. We tabled that. No we did not. It wasn'’t seconded. [man] Could we have a ruling from the Chair, please? Why don'’t we give Kristen a chance? Is that your ruling? You could at least try to be a little polite to a lady, huh? The real problem here'’s the same as it'’s always been. We all know the IFC clique doesn'’t want to delegate power to any group it doesn'’t control. And we have the votes, too. Yes, they do have the votes. And that'’s the reason the steering committee hasn'’t been able to get anywhere so far. There'’s no point in sending any group to negotiate, unless we'’re willing to back them up with enough authority, so they can do the job. Come on, let'’s have a vote already, I'’m cutting a lab. Move to previous question. Second. All right, the motion is that the Steering Committee be empowered to enter into binding agreements with representatives of the Student Faculty Board, without prior ratification by the General Membership. In favor? Opposed? Motion is defeated. [Kristin] It'’s just so hopeless, it makes me want to cry. [Paps] Then why do you keep going back? [Kristin] Maybe I'’m a fanatic. [Paps] Or a masochist. I mean you said so yourself, it'’s hopeless, so why do you keep knocking yourself out? [Kristin] I don'’t know, I just keep thinking maybe I can get through to them somehow. Ah, the hell with them. Look, the whole point is, is that we'’re immune to all that, as long as we'’re cool with each other, we'’ve got nothing to worry about. That'’s a rather selfish attitude, don'’t you think? Selfish? You didn'’t understand a word I said, did you? [Kristin] I don'’t want to get into an argument about it. [jazz plays] You get around, don'’t you? Lovely little pied a terre you have here. Oh, excuse me. Let me present my traveling secretary and confidant, Heap. This is Pappadopoulis. What'’s crackin'’, baby? What do you want? Make us some coffee, Heap. No no, stay where you are, Gnossos. Please don'’t go to any trouble on our account. Look Mojo, I told you already, I'’m not dealing around here. At least you ought to wait till I'’ve outlined the proposition. You might find it tempts you. Short, pleasant trip abroad, all expenses paid, plus a considerable cash payment. I don'’t care, man. I don'’t care what it is. Surely it'’s not a matter of your moral scruples. I thought you beyond that sort of-- I am in a whole new scene here, and I keep it very cool. So find yourself a new boy. That is a disappointment. Still, perhaps you might recommend someone. I can'’t help you there either. A pity. But just to show that there are no hard feelings, this is merely a gift. No strings attached whatever, I assure you. Do take a taste of this admirable boo at the first opportunity, special Cuban blend. And now, we must be pushing on. [Kristin] Gnossos, don'’t make such a big deal about it. He is my father, for Christ'’s sake. What did you tell him? He'’s interested in what I do. After all, I am his only daughter. Told him about you, he'’s just curious. Quite natural from his point of view. Just wants to see what you'’re like, that'’s all. Well he'’s so god damned anxious to meet me, what did you tell him? Nothing, just that I'’ve been seeing you. It'’s been a while, you know, he'’s figured it out. He'’s not dumb, even though he does work for the government. All he'’s asking, all I'’m asking is for one short weekend of your valuable time, just so he can see you, talk to you for a little while. Look, I just don'’t feature myself sitting on a veranda down in Chevy Chase, sipping martinis, and shooting the shit about how the gold reserve is depleting, and the coloreds are moving in. And has it occurred to you that I might want you to out of simple respect for my family? Respect? How many times have you told me what a fascist bastard he is, hmm? That'’s beside the point. [birds singing] Hey baby, it'’s just not cool, any way you look at it. Where'’d you get it? An old buddy of yours. [Paps] Hmm? That guy, Mojo. [Paps] How do you know him? From that party, out by the Dairy Queen. Look, he'’s a bad cat, an evil son of a bitch. I know the cat is a dope peddler. The kind of shit he'’s into, peddling dope is an alibi for. Man, is the cat for real, or is he just jive? Oh no, he'’s for real. That'’s the trouble. Well that'’s all I want to know, then. Hey look Heff, I'’m telling you, you get into a scene with him and sooner or later it'’s gonna end up bad. The cat'’s not gonna marry my sister, I'’m just gonna pick up a little shit for him, that'’s all. Come on Heff, don'’t bullshit me. Look, it'’s a free ticket to Cuba, and a little operating capital on top. And just between you and me, once I get down there, I just might not come back. What do you mean? There'’s lots of interesting things going on down there, man. Cats with beards runnin'’ all around out there in the hills, gettin'’ ready for a full-on revolution. Man, you'’ve been watching too many of those old movies on the late show. The third enchilada on the left contains the map of the minefields. Deliver to Zircon de Fapa. Come on, Paps. You'’re gonna tell me that don'’t sound like a gas? Are you out of your fuckin'’ mind? No man. Oh, wow. I got a lot of work to do on your head. Hey hey hey, where you going? To the library. What for? I have two papers due next week, and I have to get to work on them. I just can'’t concentrate here. All right, I'’ll see you later, huh? Look, if you had eyes to split, that'’s one thing. But why does it have to be Cuba? Why not? I want to be someplace where things are happening for a change. You know they use real bullets down there. You can get killed. Well, something'’s gonna kill you sooner or later, man. It'’s what you do in the meantime that matters. You'’re really going then? You know it, man. Two more days, then it'’s goodbye bullshit. Rosenbloom'’s going too, we'’re driving down in his car. There'’s room if you want to make-- No thanks, man, I fought my wars already. Hey listen man, we'’ve gotta have a real blast before you go. You and Jack come over and I'’ll fix you a Greek feast. I mean real gyro food, huh? I don'’t know, man. What do you mean, you don'’t know? Look Paps, that scene puts me uptight, okay? What are you talking about? You and the chick, man. I just can'’t cut being in the middle of all that hostility. What hostility? That'’s a few minor hassles, that'’s all. Anything you say, Paps. Look, you can'’t make deals with love. It'’s all, or it'’s nothing at all. Says who? Everybody. There'’s even a song for Christ'’s sake, To give up everything for you. Well, for you it'’s a different thing. Why? Because you don'’t have anything to give up. You don'’t actually do anything. All you do is sit and smoke pot, and talk about your immunity and how much hipper you are than everybody else. I happen to be hipper than anybody else. Well, what good does it do you, for God'’s sake? And that'’s what you give me when I ask you to give up that shit-ass committee? Man, you got a lot of hostility in you, you know that? And it'’s getting more and more, too. You think you can put down my family, my major, and my committee, and that'’s all right. I don'’t do it to be nasty, it just happens to be my honest opinion. What do you want me to do, lie about it? Gnossos, even if you are totally right, if all I do isn'’t worth a plug nickel, then it'’s still one plug nickel more than your scene is worth. Let me explain it to you very slowly. The only thing that'’s happening in your life is me. Outside of that, there just isn'’t anything. Nothing at all. Just a guy sitting in a chair, smoking a joint. Then what are you hanging around for? Just to make sure you get the point. Well, in that case, you might as well split. In that case I will. [Paps] Go! Just go! Where'’s Kristin? What'’s the matter? Where is she? I thought she was with you. She signed out overnight. I thought naturally if she-- [creaks] Who'’s there? [creaking] [creaking] [birds screeching] Okay, you son of a bitch, come on if you'’re coming. [screeching] I'’ve seen it before, my own personal monkey demon. You ought to try to get some sleep. Yeah, you bet. You'’ll be safe here. It won'’t come back tonight. If it does man, it can have me. That would gain nothing. Listen, Gnossos, if it should come back, for any reason, you must stand up and defy it. Make it go back to its cave. You got a shotgun? I'’m serious. The way you describe it, it seems so familiar. Cut out that familiar, you'’re scaring the crap out of me. I'’m sorry, but you know... there is danger, Gnossos. But why, god damn it, that'’s what I don'’t understand. The whole point is, I'’m supposed to be immune. Apparently, not to everything. Not to her. Oh Jesus. Get some sleep, okay? I'’ll be nearby. [Paps] Hey, Calvin? Thanks, man. It'’s all right, Gnossos. [birds shrieking] Get outta here, you bastard. [silence] [gasping] [Beth] You shouldn'’t be here, Gnossos. Well, Jesus Christ. He has no answers to give you. Hey Beth, please go away, all right? I'’m trying to get my head into something here. Forms, objects, creatures? Look, I don'’t know myself. That'’s Calvin'’s ethos. Yeah, all right, so what? You'’ll kill yourself, that'’s what. Everybody'’s talking kill all of a sudden. Can we just cool it out with the kill for a while, huh? It'’s no good, Gnossos. It doesn'’t work. It forces you away from what you really are. Hey Beth, come on man. It'’s the middle of the night. Listen to me. You can'’t stay there. You can'’t live in that place he wants you to go. You have to come back or you'’ll die, don'’t you see that? Leave me alone, will you? He'’s sitting up tonight, all night, looking through his occult books, trying to find your demon. He'’s a fool, Gnossos. He'’ll never find it in the occult. He'’s your goddamn husband, what are you putting him down for? He doesn'’t know what'’s real. Oh, Jesus. That, that'’s real. [bell ringing] Hello, Heff? Hey... Hey man, look I'’m out here in a phone booth. Could you come pick me up? Yeah, I know. But you see, the thing is, I can'’t. I don'’t know where to go. [sobbing] [softly] Let me go. [surf pounding] [gulls calling] I saw the contact man this morning. Cat named Mugabon. Got a backroom full of the most wasted junkies you ever saw, runs a cantina right around the corner from the hotel. Score day after tomorrow, then it'’s off to the hills. Oh man, it'’s gonna be so beautiful. Six months, that'’s all they figure. A full scale offensive by New Year'’s, and then it'’s all over. Sounds terrific. Only watch your ass. Oh man, will you stop with that shit already? Okay, you and the chick had a bad thing going, like you finally got hip to it, and you split. So it'’s over, for Christ'’s sake. Over? What do you mean over? Who said anything about it being over? Then what the hell you doin'’ down here? I'’m just laying out for a while, that'’s all. Till she wakes up. Once she realizes-- Look, you'’re the one that'’s got to wake up. She'’s got a noose around your neck and it stretches all the way from there to here. [in foreign language] He says not to worry, he'’s gonna give you a prescription from the farmacia, very strong pills. You'’ll be fine in about two weeks. Okay. Come on, let'’s split. [in foreign language] He says that to bring the clap to Havana, is like bringing bread to the bakers. I saw piles already, come on I want to get out of here. [in foreign language] You owe him two dollars, American. This is on me. I wish it was, man. I wish it was. Yeah? Yeah. So, are you sure it was her? It was her. How do you know? Look, it was her, god damn it. Hey, come on man, be cool. It couldn'’t be anybody else, because I haven'’t made it with anybody else, that'’s how I know. All right. But still. Look man, just forget it, all right? Believe me man, this is the best thing that could have happened to you. How do you figure that? No, I mean it. Yeah, well I'’m just celebrating is all. Well look, now at least you know what'’s happening. I kept asking myself, shit, now what'’s it gonna take for him to realize that he'’s into a bad scene? Well, okay, now you know. And later with all that positive thinking. Hey look, there ain'’t gonna be no later, the time for you to straighten out is now, or it'’s never. You better listen to me, man. I ain'’t bullshittin'’ you now. What you gonna do? Lie here on your ass for the rest of your life? I'’ll be all right, I just have to lay out for a while. Well what the hell you think you been doin'’ besides laying out? Look, I'’m not asking you to come up to the hills with me. Make any scene you want to, but for Christ'’s sakes, knock off the bullshit, and get your ass on the move. Hey Heff, let'’s don'’t beef, okay? Don'’t you understand? I'’m not beefing with you, I ain'’t got time for it, and I ain'’t got time to sit here and hold your hand while you get it together, either. Hey, you American? Huh? You want to get laid, huh? No, no. I got nice nookie nookie virgin. Come on huh, come on, come on? Let go of me, huh? 20 years old. Very chick, you'’ll like her. Come on, man, huh? Hey vamos,huh? Hey come on, man. Hey hey hey.

Yes yes yes. It'’s a great pleasure to meet you, sir. My wife, Maude, your arrival is perfectly timed. This evening we'’re having a few of our regular patrons in for a little informal poetry reading. I do hope you'’ll be able to stay and join us. I'’ll stay, I'’ll stay. Vachel Lindsay tonight. I do so like him, don'’t you? I'’m just mixing up the refreshments now. An old family recipe, we call it summer snow. It'’s strictly, organic natural ingredients in the hands of mother nature. So, nothing artificial. Milk, shredded fresh coconut, orange juice, raspberry sherbet, white Bacardi Rum, mashed peyote buttons, and a soupçon of cocaine, for flavor. Drink it through this. It does something for the taste. Impossible to explain but. Last night at black midnight I awoke with a cry. The windows were shaking, there was thunder on high. The floor was atremble, the door was ajar. White fires, crimson fires, shown from afar. I rushed to the dooryard, the city was gone. My home was a hut, without orchard or lawn. It was mud smear and logs near a whispering stream. Nothing else built by man could I see in my dream. Then, ghost kings came headlong, row upon row. Gods of the Indians, torches aglow. They mounted the bear and the elk and the deer, and eagles gigantic, aged, and sere. They rode longhorn cattle, they cried, ah la la. They lifted the knife, the bow and the spear, they lifted ghost torches from fires below. My idea, is a verse cycle, encompassing the vast body of American poetry, right on up through Edgar A Guest. My customers seem to enjoy it, remarkably faithful in their attendance. As long as they got that tube in their face. Puts them in the proper mood, dear boy. Makes them more receptive. Now this evening, I'’m going to start working my way through Edward Arlington Robinson. Now you'’ll enjoy that. [guns firing] [dog barking] It'’s just a minor political disagreement, becoming quite common nowadays.[siren wailing] It'’s nothing to worry about. They never come in here. Now the thing I like about Robinson is that queer little sense of meter. [faint Spanish music] Paps? Paps! Come on, man. Come on, you'’ve got to hold onto me. Come on, you don'’t know what'’s happened. There'’s been a lot of trouble. You'’re all right, come on go.
