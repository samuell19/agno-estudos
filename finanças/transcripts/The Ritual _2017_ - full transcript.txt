The keeper catches it comfortably. It now looks like there will be a substitution for the blues. Gentry replaces Penny. - Take your time. - BARMAN: You what? Big head on that, mate. Thank you. No problem. MAN: Oh, yeah, two weeks straight drinking, man. What a great time. Had a great time. Felt better when I got home. - (LAUGHS) - Easy. - What about... What about Ibiza? - No, we're too old for Ibiza. What are you talking about? You're never too old for the island, mate. That's what people who are too old for Ibiza say. Where are the crisps? Oh, I said, "Can I have crisps for that guy," I pointed to you, and he said you're not allowed to have crisps any more. Said you're only allowed salads. Fucking dickhead. It's just what he said, Dom, I'm sorry. That's harsh, man. Why don't we go to... Boom, Amsterdam? - No, it's too touristy now, innit? - All right, TripAdvisor. - I'm not getting off my head again. - Tuscany? - Yeah, yeah, no, good wines. - No. - DOM: Berlin, then? - Nein. - Belgium? - Belgium? Mate, no-one's ever been to Belgium by choice. - What's in Belgium? - Beers that are like 42% or something. What about hiking? Hiking in Sweden? - Hiking? - Yeah. - Hiking. - That's a good shout. Come on, man, let's do something good. - What's it called again? - The King's Trail. It kind of runs up between Sweden and Norway. You can go there in the summer. Oh, yeah, yeah, it's like the Appalachian Trail, right? Yeah. Apart from there's more history than hill billies. We wanna do something different. I just don't want go to Amsterdam. You wanna mix it up. Yeah, it's not like we're 21 any more. Oh, look, there's that... I'm gonna get a bottle. - Who's on it? - No way. School night, mate. I wanna crack on. So no-one... Anyone wanna come with me? - Nope. - Come on, Robert. - Yeah, go on, then. - Oh, man. - Bad idea. - Anyone want any sweets or anything? You're not involved in that, are you? - I'm getting an Uber. - Yeah, good. Don't you think that it's getting harder now to have a good time? Do you know that Phil actually suggested making this brunch? Fucking brunch. I'm not, I'm not, I'm not gonna plan a lads' holiday over a fucking avocado on toast, mate. - I'm just... I'm not doing it. - Avocado's all right. Do you really wanna go hiking? Hiking, for fun? - Yeah. - In fucking Sweden? Yeah, I do. I dunno, I just wanna test myself a little, you know. A challenge. What would be a challenge is getting Dom on the side of a mountain. Where's the vodka? Just a shame, you know. It's a shame. It's a shame what he's become. Yeah. Yeah, big shame, yeah. Big successful businessman with a beautiful wife and children. Yeah, no, it's a... (WHIMPERING) - (EXHALES SHARPLY) - Don't fucking argue, you cunt! There's more! Where the fuck is it, huh? - (WOMAN SOBBING) - Stop fucking crying! (BOTTLES RATTLE) Don't fucking move. - Give me your wallet. - MAN 1: Right, give it to him. ROBERT: Okay, okay, it's okay. MAN 1: Don't just stand there, do it! MAN 2: Give me your fucking wallet. - What else you got? - MAN 1: What else you got? - (BOTTLE SMASHES) - MAN 1: Just take his watch. - Give me the fucking watch. - All right, no problem, here. - MAN 1: Do it! - ROBERT: Okay, all right. MAN 2: And the ring. ROBERT: No. It's my wedding ring. - MAN 1: We don't give a fuck! - MAN 2: Just give me the fucking ring. - MAN 1: Just take it off him! - ROBERT: No. Look, you've done enough. It... Just leave. Take it the fuck off him! ROBERT: Come on. MAN 1: Listen, you take that ring off or I will fuck you up! - Look, I'm not... - (ROARS) - (WOMAN SCREAMS) - (GASPS) MAN 2: Oh, fuck! Mate, what are you doing? MAN 1: I told you. - MAN 2: Fucking hell, mate! - (GASPS) What are you doing? MAN 1: It's all right. - For fuck's sake. Leave it. - MAN 2: Right, let's go, let's go! (RUNNING FOOTSTEPS) (WIND HOWLS) (WIND BLOWS) (TENT UNZIPS) (TENT UNZIPS) Morning. Fuck me, it's cold. I'll get the coffees on. - Morning, bud. - Morning. - How did you sleep? - (GROANS) Like I'd just walked up a big fucking mountain, man. One night down, two to go, mate. Makes you feel insignificant, right? - DOM: Speak for yourself. - Come on, man, where's your soul? These mountains were smashed out by Nordic gods with big bastard hammers. You know what they have on walking trails in England? - Pubs. - Yeah, whatever. Don't tell me you're not impressed. Yeah, yeah, these are new boots. Reduced to 200 quid. - Memory foam as well. - But you still need to break them in. Yeah, definitely. It's just basic common sense, Phil. Okay, I think I've found a spot. Just up the top of that hill. - Fuck me. - It's beautiful. (BREATHES HEAVILY AND SNIFFS) Jesus... Christ! Oh, fuck every hill in the world. Shall we do this? - Bo will be up there waiting for him. - Man, I hated that dog. He was a good man. The best of us. It should never have happened. It should never have happened but it did... - And all we can do is remember him. - (SNIFFS) (SNIFFS) (SNIFFS) Robert, we miss you, mate. DOM: We haven't seen her. I can't remember the last time I saw her. PHIL: Yeah, I mean, she mentioned Gayle. DOM: Yeah, well, they get on. (INDISTINCT CONVERSATION) Rob would have loved this place. Except we wouldn't be here, though, would we? We'd be on some terrible lads' holiday that he would have hated. I've said it before, I don't care what anyone says, it wasn't your fault, mate. - Fucking hell, is that the lodge? - I think it is, yeah. Ah. I thought we were further out than that. Uh-uh. When we get back I was thinking I might stop on a few days. Maybe get out there, do a little bit more hiking. - What do you think, man? - I dunno, mate. Come all this way, we gotta make the most of it. No, I think this is enough for me. (THUNDER RUMBLES) What are you doing, man? Here, give it here. You've done it the wrong way round. Give it here. Unclip the pole. DOM: Christ! (WIND HOWLS) PHIL: Oh, this is awful in almost every conceivable way. DOM: There are some, Phil, who consider this character building. Quite frankly, right now, Sweden can lick my bridge. - Lick your what? - My bridge. - Jesus Christ, the bridge. - Oh, you mean the perineum. - Yeah, the gooch. The bridge. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Argh! - (THUD) Fuck! - Come on, let's get you up. - Argh! Fuck, shit! All right, come on. Easy, easy. - Come on, mate, you're all right. - Up, up, up. Yeah, all right, easy. - Oh, fuck. - Walk about a bit on it. - Argh! - Give it a walk around. That's it. You're okay. Argh! No, it's twisted. It's twisted. - Can you put your full weight on it? - Hurts like a son of a bitch. You could probably walk it off, couldn't you? No, no, it's my meniscus. I've done it before, it's fucked. We'll get him something to lean on. Phil, can you get the rods, please? What we thinking, Dom? 'Cause the trail goes right round those mountains there, and it's probably, what, six hours till we camp? Another eight round to the lodge. What we thinking? Fuck me. I'm not doing 14 hours on this. Okay, man? Let's get the map. - Wanna try your phone as well? - No, no need. - Well, there's no reception anyway. - Cheers, man. Luke, my office. What do you think? I think we could be carrying him out of here like a fucking Egyptian princess - if we're not careful. - Probably not as bad as he says it is. Almost certainly not as bad as he says it is, but it's not gonna stop him moaning the whole way back, is it? There is another way out of this, man. What? Well, you saw it last night. The lodge. It's not that far as the crow flies. Look, if we go south-west, through here, we cut the journey in half. - What, through the forest? - Yeah, why not? Little off-trail hiking. Could be exciting. Might even do us some good. We could be kicking back by the evening time. I think we need this. Look, why don't me and you leave them here with the food and then we can go back, get some help? No fucking way you're leaving us on this fucking mountain. I can walk. All right? If you know a quicker route, let's do it. (PANTING) - How's the knee, Dom-Dom? - Killing me. How's your mum? Unnecessary, innit? - Are there bears in this forest? - Course there's fucking bears. Big bastards as well. DOM: Should have gone to Vegas. PHIL: You'd have found something to fall over in Vegas, too. DOM: Yeah, a massive pile of tits. Shithouse. Everything in this bastard country is a relic. Strange place to park, innit? My next door neighbour's got one of those. My eldest is absolutely obsessed by it. I got a hand job in one of those once, at a festival. Thanks, Phil. What a beautiful story. - We sure this is a good idea? - What's up? You scared of the woods? DOM: Now, is it me or is it really quiet in here? All right, don't shit your pants. The trees soak up the sound. That's what trees do. DOM: Hiking was easier yesterday. LUKE: We weren't in the forest yesterday. DOM: No, we bloody weren't. The sooner we get going, the sooner we get to the town, the sooner we get to the bar, the sooner we get drunk. The Swedes were big into logging, until the 1950s. - Then they decided to pack it in. - That's interesting. Which is why Sweden is an untouched land of natural beauty and Britain is a car park. DOM: If you love Sweden so much, why don't you marry it? Right, time out. Dom, what did Gayle say when you told her you were going on a hiking holiday? She said, "Who are you? What have you done with my husband?" Oh, here we go, photo op. - Here we go. - (CHUCKLES) Scott of the Antarctic. - Fucking Amelia Earhart over there. - Wallop. Yes, that's it. Let's get a selfie while we're here. - DOM: Selfie? Really? - You too, Luke, come on. - Let's preserve this magic moment. - It's a beautiful thing. Here we go. Everyone get in. One, two, three, and Brexit. - (LENS CLICKS) - Boom. - Yes. - Yeah, yeah, four twats in a forest. Yeah. (TWIGS SNAP) My stomach is beginning to eat itself. Yeah, I could do a steak. Big fat, juicy steak. One peppercorn sauce, one hand-cooked chips. Side salad. Nice tumbler of Scotch. And a big fat cigar at the end. PHIL: Ah, man, I could go for some sushi right now. Yeah, some red wine instead of white. Lashings of wasabi. Big Mac, plastic tray, by myself, no-one to talk to. - Can I have a kebab, please, mate? - Donner? No, chicken shish, please. Rob liked a donner. You remember that? Yeah. Every Saturday night at uni. There he was, pissed, covered in grease. What the fuck? What the fuck is it? (FLIES BUZZING) - DOM: Why is it ripped open? - It's been gutted. Yeah, but why hang it like that? I mean, would someone do that? Well, it didn't fucking put itself there, that's for sure. - Could be hunters out here. - What, bait? Possibly. Or it's the bit they don't show you in the nature documentaries. What could do that, though? - A bear. - Do bears do that? I don't know, Dominic, I'm not a fucking bear expert. - It's still bleeding. - So? So it means that whatever did that, we should go. It's a fresh kill. Yeah, we should go. (THUNDER RUMBLES) (THUNDER CRASHING) (THUNDER CRASHING) DOM: Fucking Jesus Christ! - Fuck. - (THUNDER CRASHING) - Where the hell are we, Hutch? - Let me check. PHIL: This is ridiculous, man. - HUTCH: We should pitch the tents. - What? We should pitch the tents! So we're giving up making it back to town tonight, then? I don't see we have much choice, Philip. Guys. - What is it? What is it? - Look at this. - Huh? - Look. (THUNDER RUMBLES) - HUTCH: Well, how about that? - PHIL: What is that? Is that a house? - Come on. - Thank Christ. - DOM: Hey, Hutch. Wait a minute! - Come on! (THUNDER RUMBLES) - DOM: Can you see anything? - It looks empty! DOM: We should leave it alone, then. - Let's kick it in. - No fucking way. We need to get undercover, mate. - Phil, give us a hand. - All right, come on, then. Wait, wait, wait, wait! We can't just break in. We can't stay out here all night. On three, yeah? - One, two, three. - (THUD) (THUNDER RUMBLES) (SHORT ROAR) (THUNDER RUMBLES) (SHORT SHRIEK) - Luke, you're getting soaked. - Did you hear that? No, I didn't hear anything. Come on. (THUNDER RUMBLES) This is clearly the house we'll get murdered in. HUTCH: It's not as bad as our uni accommodation. That's the shape on the tree, I think. Guys, this place is definitely abandoned, yeah? Abandoned? Who'd have moved in? HUTCH: Whoever it was, they were packing. Look at that. - I don't like this place. - Not too keen on it myself, mate, but it's a lesser-of-two-evils kind of situation. Hutch. I definitely just heard something outside. Well, maybe you did, Lukey. We're not the only animals in the woods. Right, let's see if we can get this stove working. We'll need stuff to burn. - PHIL: Like what? - HUTCH: Anything made of wood'll do. (THUNDER RUMBLES) PHIL: We're gonna smash the place up, are we? - And what if the homeowners come back? - Fuck 'em. Anyone who lives here has more to worry about than their table being on fire. Might be some stuff to burn up there. Go on, Phil, you're nearest. - What? - Go on. - Do you want me to come with you? - No. (ALL CHUCKLING) - (CHAIR SMASHES) - HUTCH: Wa-hey, that's it, lad! (LAUGHTER) Dickheads. (THUNDER RUMBLES) (DOOR CREAKS) Guys, get the fuck up here right now! What now? Oh, shit. Oh, my God. What the fuck is that? - That's witchcraft. - Huh? That's what that is, that's witchcraft. LUKE: Is that meant to be a person? PHIL: What, with no head and antlers for hands? If I hear anything coming down the stairs... Don't. Fucking hell! I'm going downstairs to get that fire started. You guys can stay up here if you want. - Yep. Good idea. - Come on. LUKE: Looked like that fucking thing in the tree. HUTCH: Could be idolising a spirit or a deity. Some kind of pagan or Nordic shit. Like an offering or something. Yeah, well, I almost offered up a massive shit when I saw it. - I thought they worshipped Odin. - Well, that is Nordic. Who knows what they're into out here? Living here, in the middle of nowhere. Sun goes down, don't come up for six months. You're bound to go fucking mental in the winter. We should probably burn this place down when we leave. - Fucking well up for burning it down. - (CHUCKLES) Listen, though, I think that, um, when we wake up tomorrow, we should think about just going back out the way we came. We don't need to wilfully add another day to the trip, do we? - Let's just stick to the shortcut... - My old scoutmaster used to say "If the shortcut was a shortcut, it would be called a route." Why pretend you were in the Scouts? You were never in the Scouts. Where did I get the quote from, then? Guys, right, we have a map, we have a compass, we have supplies. So as long as we don't panic, as long as we don't fuck ourselves - we're gonna be absolutely okay. - DOM: No-one's fucking anyone. - Who knows? It could be a long night. - No-one's fucking anybody. (CHUCKLES) DOM: We're in sleeping bags, for crying out loud. It could get messy. I'll give any of you a grand to go upstairs and sleep with that thing. Absolutely no way. - My wife would never forgive me. - No, she wouldn't. - Good night. - Yeah, all right, okay. Couple of hours, soon as it's light, we'll get out. (THUNDER RUMBLES) (FAINT KNOCKING) (FAINT GROWL) (THUNDER RUMBLES) (THUNDER CRASHING) (STORM STOPS) (WHISPERS) Hutch. (GASPS) (BOTTLES RATTLE) (INHALES AND EXHALES DEEPLY) (PANTING) (EXHALES SHARPLY) (SCREAMS) - (HUTCH SCREAMS AND GASPS) - Hutch? Hutch? Mate, wake up. Mate. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay. - Where the fuck am I? - We're in that house. We're in that fucking house, okay? Get up, okay? Get up. Where's the... Where's my fucking... Jesus Christ. I've pissed myself. (SOBS) Gayle. LUKE: Dom? DOM: (WHIMPERS) Gayle! - LUKE: Dom. - (WHIMPERS) Dom! - Gayle! - Wake up. Mate, mate, it's okay. (CRYING) Get up, mate. Wake up. Where's Phil? - Where the fuck's... - (CREAKS FROM UPSTAIRS) (DOOR CREAKS) (UNDER HIS BREATH) Oh, fuck. Phil. Fuck! - Phil. Phil, what are you doing? - (GROANS) - Phil, what are you doing? - (PHIL GROANS) - It's okay. - (HYPERVENTILATES) It's okay. Mate, get up, okay? What's this? What's this? I don't know. I don't know, mate. Get up, okay? DOM: Just grab everything. Just shove it in the bags, let's go. Can we fucking hurry up, yeah? I want to get out of here now! DOM: Oh, for fuck's sake. - We shouldn't be here. - LUKE: It's a warning. No, we don't know that. We do not know that. - It's a warning. - Fuck! Listen. Hutch, we just go out the way we came in, okay? - We go north-east. - HUTCH: It's a knee-jerk plan. - Guys. - It's a bad plan. - Mate. - Hey! Hey! Is that a path? No, Dom, south-west is this way, mate. South-west can go and fuck itself. You said we were getting out of this forest yesterday. The storm slowed us down. What do you want? So did the dead thing hanging in the trees and the spooky fucking house! Um, can we go? We don't even know where that goes. We could end up in Norway for all we know. Great! You know, I'm sick of this off-road bollocks. Okay? A path means civilisation. Dom. Marvellous. So are we gonna talk about it, then, or not? Because I'd really like to talk about it. - I'd rather not, mate. - You'd rather not? I woke up stark bollock naked in front of that thing, praying to it, and I'd love someone to explain it to me. It was a nightmare, Phil. What's commonly known as a nightmare. - What happened to you, then, mate? - We all did. We all had nightmares. We got spooked and we had bad dreams. - All right? - Yeah. Leave it out, mate. Hang on, mate. You were screaming and shouting at the top of your voice. You were shouting "Gayle!" - Have you ever done that before? - I said leave it out, Luke. - Something made me do that. - Press on. Bad dreams or not, I'd never have done that. Something was in that house. For fuck's sake, Phil! Listen to yourself, mate. I'm a bit fucking humiliated about being found in my kegs covered in piss. All right? I don't really wanna psychoanalyse it. I don't wanna play fucking make-believe because, right now, we have some real fucking problems. Like finding out which way this fucking path ends up. Enough of the bullshit ghost stories, okay? You're starting to sound like my daughters. Outside I'd never have done that, mate. PHIL: Something's not right here. (ECHOING BREATH) - Did you say south-west, yeah? - Yes. - Which way is south-west? - That ridge up there. - What, towards the light? - Yeah. We're just tracking along it. Five more minutes on this path and I'm pulling rank. You see these things? Man-made. We're getting somewhere. (HUTCH BREATHES HEAVILY) - HUTCH: Should we have a look? - Absolutely not. - Let's keep going. - Yep. We can still get out of here today. LUKE: Dom... Dom, maybe we should think about this. Dom. Guys, I just need a minute. My knee's killing me. These are the wrong fucking shoes. Er, Dom, you might have to push through the pain barrier a bit, mate. - We can't keep going at this pace. - Screw you. I'm through the pain barrier. I'm in bloody agony. No. I think you're uncomfortable. There's a difference. Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't realise you were a doctor. Go give yourself a fucking prostate exam and leave me in peace, yeah? Dom, come on, get up. No. Dom, I want out of these woods now. Please get up. This is fucking ridiculous. I'm gonna go to the top of that ridge, see if I can see anything. Yeah. Yeah, good idea, man. - To the ridge, straight back. - Got it. - Don't go too far. - Yeah, got it! (PANTING) Fuck! (BREATHES HEAVILY) (INHALES AND EXHALES DEEPLY) - (INHALES) - (TWIG SNAPS) (ROARING) (BRANCHES CRACKING) LUKE: Guys! - Everything okay? - There's something up there. DOM: What are you talking about? - There's something in those woods. - What do you mean? - Something fucking big. - HUTCH: Like an animal? What? Can we not do this, please? Can we all agree to not start losing our fucking shit in here? - There is fucking something up there. - Shut up. Okay, listen, I'm not trying to fucking freak you out but I woke up last night and there was some fucking... And look at this. - What... - What the fuck is that? Nothing has done that to you. You... You're on your own. You've done it to yourself. - I fucking what? - You walked into a fucking tree. Why do you have to fucking deny everything I say? Because I do not value your judgement, Luke. And I wanna get the fuck out of here. Listen, mate, we wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you! No, we wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you! Dom, shut up. Come on, what do you mean by that? Track it back. - You know what I'm talking about. - No. No, I don't. I don't, no. Why don't you just, er... - Fucking come out and say it? - Come on, guys. This is bullshit! - Come on, mate. - Now there it is! Now he's got some fucking fight in him, yeah? Well, where was that with Rob? You fight your friends, you can't stand up for them. You are not my fucking friend any more. No, I am not. - No, you're fucking not. - HUTCH: Oh, for fuck's sake, guys. No, you are fucking not. Okay? Do you know what? I am fucking done with you. Not a drop of blood on you. Fucking coward. - What? - Dom, will you shut the fuck up. No, hang on, Hutch, mate. Hang on. Hang on. What? Fucking what? He has his skull cracked in half and you come out of there without a drop of blood on you. Argh! - HUTCH: What the fuck are you doing? - PHIL: Dom, are you all right, mate? - He's broken my nose! - Shut up. You've not broken your nose, all right? Don't start your shit now. You keep quiet if you want, but somebody's got to say something. This is exactly the kind of situation where people fall out and we need to be... Where you going? We need to be working together, man! Luke. Fucking hell. Luke. Luke. Is that what you think? Eh? That it was my fault? That I should have stood up? I don't know. Looks like someone was here. Are we stopping? What the fuck is that? Yeah, what is that, man? Some sort of fabric, I think. (STRAINS) (GRUNTS) I think it's a tent or something. It's a credit card. Anna Eriksen. Expires 1984. That's a bad sign, isn't it? Just leaving your tent behind and your shoes? Guys. Guys, seriously, come on. We're not gonna be these people, right? Okay? Because we registered at the lodge. And in five hours' time, five hours' time, they are gonna report us missing. We're on a path in the woods. It's near a hiking trail. This is where people get found, right? It's getting dark again. (GROANS) (EXHALES) Oh, thanks. Thank you. Thank you. How are you doing? I'm looking forward to the rescue party. (CHUCKLES) Dom's knee is getting worse, not better. Phil's not looking great. You're the strongest. You should try and get out, get help. I'll stay with these two. - You think so? - Definitely. I'll get you fixed up in the morning. - Take the compass, head south-west. - Okay. - Keep south-west. - Okay. - Good man, mate. - Yeah. How are we doing here, mate? Let's have a look at this. HUTCH: Ooh, looks nasty, that, man. (RUSTLING) PHIL: Yeah, it's not good. - HUTCH: Have you put anything on it? - No, I haven't got anything. HUTCH: Maybe Dom's got something in his backpack. PHIL: Fucking shoes. HUTCH: That looks grim.

(PHIL GRUNTS) - (PHILE HYPERVENTILATES) - (PANTING) - Where's Hutch? - I don't know, man. - Where's Hutch? - All I saw was shadows. - What? - I don't know! It just... It took him. Hutch? - (GROANS) - Hutch! - Get up, Hutch has gone. - What? Hutch has gone! (HUTCH SCREAMS) (ROARING) (FEROCIOUS ROARING) - (DISTANT SCREAMING) - Oh, fuck. (SCREAM FADES) - PHIL: What we gonna do? - LUKE: I don't know. Hutch? Hutch! - LUKE: Hutch! - Luke... Hutch! DOM: Luke, we're getting turned around out here. - Hutch! - We should try and retrace our steps. Everything we have is in the tents, Luke. - He's fucking screaming. - I know. But if we run around in circles, we're gonna get fucking lost. Okay? We need to get back to the camp and get our bearings. Yeah? Fuck... Fuck. We'll find the tents and come back for him. (INHALES SHARPLY) (WHIMPERS) Is that... Is that Hutch? (PANTING) Oh, my God! (DOM CONTINUES CRYING OUT) (PANTING) Oh, fuck. Come on! - Did he have the map? - No. - What are we gonna tell Catherine? - I don't know. - What about his kids? - Listen, okay? Just calm down. We need to get out of here, now. We need to move. We can't leave him here. We can't bury him. Okay? We'll send people to come and get him. Fucking hell, we don't know where we are. - It put him there, didn't it? - What? It knew we were gonna come this way and we were supposed to find him, weren't we? LUKE: Oh, for fuck's sakes. You don't fucking do this. You keep your, your shit together. Shush. He's right. I'm not... I'm not leaving him like this. (PANTING AND MOANING) - We should say something. - We need to go. It's gonna come back. Dom, come on. Come on. PHIL: It was at that house. We had those nightmares and it followed us, didn't it? Yeah. It followed us from that house and it did that to Hutch. Did you actually see it yesterday? I don't know what I saw. Well... I did see it, while I was up on that ridge, and the trees were the same as this. Oh, Jesus Christ. It was big, okay? It had to be to put that fucking elk in the tree. It was hunters, pagan fucking hill billies from those houses. No-one's lived in those houses for years. - Fucking hell! - Keep your voice down. - There are houses in this forest. - Keep it down. There are people and they killed our fucking friend! Shut the fuck up. Shut up! Keep your fucking voice down. There are three of us and there is one of it. And I've got a fucking knife. So we are gonna keep walking in the direction that Hutch said until we get out of this fucking forest. Do you hear me? (PANTING) - Oh, my God. - (RETCHES) - (GROANS) - (MOANING) You see? There's people. - Are we following these? - Course not. DOM: We shouldn't go that way. Okay. Okay. LUKE: South-west is up. DOM: I'm tired, man. Ah! (PANTING) (GASPS) It's okay. Come on, mate, get up.
