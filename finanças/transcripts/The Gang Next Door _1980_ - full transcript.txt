My turn. No, let's put it back again. But I haven't gotten my turn yet. Just let him, he'll be back soon enough. Ronny, a bit of gas, huh? If my brother finds out, we'll catch hell. Hey, Ronny! Stop now! - Well, what happened, exactly? - I don't know. Was it your fault? Of course it was his fault. - Did he see you? - I don't know. Quickly, go home. The Gang Next Door Magda Janssen. Hey! Did you get back? Yes, tell me. Ah look, is the toddler playing happily? Screw you, shut up. Cut it out, Erik. Can't you handle a joke? You shouldn't pester him, Maarten. Your father said they took him to the hospital. - Serious? - He didn't know anything more. But that one car was completely totaled. - We should have left that thing alone. - Your idea, wasn't it? Yes, but we agreed on one lap. I didn't drive more than you. We all drove two laps. But we didn't cause an accident. It's not only his fault. We've all been driving it. Can I play,too? Stay down, Carolientje. Go away! We don't have time for you. Here. Go make a nice drawing. - Can I have a cookie? - Come on! Here. - Can I have two? - Sweet tooth! So, and now beat it. Hop! - If only the police don't find out. - What would happen then? - To jail. - Ah, you're crazy! They don't put children in prison. Well, maybe not. But in reform school. Maybe nobody saw us. We don't know anything at all. If they ask us, we've been here the whole time. Agreed? If only we knew how that man is doing. - Which man? - Ronny! It's in the paper. There are no fatalities. Look, here it is. With slight injuries to his hand. Could leave the hospital after treatment. The damage to the cars is considerable. There is no trace of the moped rider. - No one saw it! - Sure! Go yell that outside, man. We'll all keep our mouth shut. We were all here this morning. We were busy with a musical. But shouldn't we not tell anybody about the musical? Better that than about the accident. See you guys. I'm going to do my paper round. Bye. Verschuur squealed on us. He's talking with two policemen. Can we see your moped helmet? It's on my moped downstairs. You shouldn't leave that thing on your moped! Are you coming downstairs with us? They're taking Maarten. But they can't touch him? He didn't do it anyhow? But it's his moped! There's so many mopeds. Maybe there's something showing on the moped. Impossible, I really didn't hit anything. You don't often see a sticker like that, huh? How did you get it? My father brought it from America, I think. The moped rider had a sticker just like that. Yes, but I've nothing to do with that accident! I'm not sayin' you did. But you'll have to come to the police station. - Is your father home? - His father no longer lives with us. Oh, sorry. I'll go along. They are taking his moped! You stay here! Let me go, it's our fault. Maarten has nothing to do with it. - But we don't have to show ourselves. - Ah, man. He's right. We need to come up with something that will help Maarten, and doesn't expose us. - If we'd write a letter in which we say... - They're driving off. What if we write that we saw that other children... Which other children? That is nasty! Hey, what fun. Come in. - Grandpa? - Yes? Daddy asked if you come and have a look at the van. Is the bloody thing not working again? Just put on my boots and coat. No, come on! Come in a little further. How nice that you're there. Maybe... maybe I've got something for you. But where did I put it? I don't remember. In the green tin on the shelf. I've to keep an eye on you. That tin now goes to a different place. So, just take one. And you too. And now let's go to the trailer park. Isn't he here yet? - Oh dear. - What are we supposed to do? Police! Act normal, huh. You've been with me this morning. - Hey guys. Doing nothing? - Yes! - Are you all living in that building? - Yes, except her. I live opposite the building, but on the other side. It's here. You've been at her place all morning? And you saw no one near that moped? - No, or we would have told him. - Whom? Well, Maarten of course. He isn't here. He might be in the trailer park. - Trailer park? - Yes, over there. Well, leave it Dad. We won't get this working. A waste of time. Ah, nonsense. Pass me that sledgehammer. What are you going to do? You don't have to demolish it. Start it. Start it! Hey! - Are you Mr. De Graaf? - Yes. - Do you know this boy? - Yes, I wouldn't know Maarten. How so? - What's going on? - Well, they think I... Has Maarten been with you this morning? Yes, we've been playing chess all morning. The whole morning. From what time? Well, from what time? What time would it have been? 8:15 AM? Eight-thirty. - But you're sure it was before nine? - Huh huh. And you'd swear to that under oath? Yes. I mean... Why would I lie! That the police believes De Graaf just like that! Well, it's possible. That boy visits there regularly. Yes, that's just it. Not only with De Graaf, but also with those people from the trailer park. Since his father left, that boy is going the wrong way. Oh, but isn't Erik a nice boy? Yes, he still is. But that kid Maarten. I think he is to blame for that accident. And I think the police believe that too. They don't just impound a moped. When would he get his moped back? Well, if he had anything to do with that accident, never. But he had nothing to do with the accident! What do you mean? How can you be so certain? Well, eh... When I went to pick up Erik this morning, Maarten was already with Opa De Graaf. Yes. Then it isn't possible, is it? But then who did it? They recognized the helmet! But of course! Why didn't I think of that before. That scum from the trailer park of course! They're always driving around with those old vehicles. I'm going to call his mother right away. Don't you feel well, Carolientje? Here. Did you give her sweets this afternoon? One cookie. Maarten Verginkel. Just hold on. Ma, it's for you. - Who is it? - Janssen. - Ronnie's father? - Yes. Hello, Anna De Groot. Mr. Janssen. So, not Maarten, you're sure? But those children. But these are only suspicions. I haven't seen the children of the trailer park at all this morning. Well, that seems rather premature. You've got something to do with it, weasel. But if I don't get back my moped because of you, - you'll pay for it, you know. - No. Of course he'll get that moped back. Well, my father said otherwise. - You told him, didn't you? - What did I tell him? That kids from the trailer park did it. Not true, he came up with that himself. It's all our fault. What does a moped like that cost? A bunch of money. Those suckers are very expensive. - More expensive than a video set? - How so? If we win first prize with our musical... Of course, fantastic! If we win first prize, then we'll have a video set. And then Maarten will have a moped. Yes, but you can't ride on such a video thing? No, doofus! But you can sell it. And then you'll have money for a moped. Yes, but first we have to win that competition. Of course we'll win. I've come up with something for the lights. Totally awesome. We'll only know the result after the holiday. That's great. Soon we'll all go to France, and we can practice with the whole group. Yes, do you really think that Maarten wants to wait for his moped that long? No, that'll take too long. But how else do we get money? - Well, earn it ourselves. - Doing what? - Well, chores and stuff. - Sell something. - Washing cars. - Cleaning up! Shoe-shine. Shoe-shine. Shoe-shine. Shoe-shine, sir? Shoe-shine! Shoe-shine! One quarter regular, two quarters super. Do you want a go? I mean a shoe-shine? - How much is it? - One quarter, sir. - Here, kid. Do I have to go in there? - Yes, sir. That doesn't look too good. If you call that shoe-shine. These shoes look tired. You need a super treatment. - And how much is that? - Another quarter. Here, kid. Are you out of your mind? Don't you move! Stay! Window wash? Daddy. Disgrace! There's the cupboard and I want you to hang it up there. It is quite a job but I'll do it for 2.50. Can we really do this? Of course! It's for Maarten's moped. (empty bottles) Where else could we find more bottles? Hey, over there, come on! Come on. Well madam, that is 2.50. - Please. - Thank you. Oh! Wait a moment. You can't do that. - Mister, do you have a job for me? - Are you pretty handy? Yes, then come along. You can sort out these bottles. Washing cars: 10 cents. - Returning bottles. - 18.25. 18.25. - Shining shoes. - 3.75. 3.75. Chores. - 21 guilders. - 21 guilders. - Gardening. - 26 guilders. - 26 guilders. - And hands full of blisters. - Begging. - 4.65. For begging for two afternoons. Even when you're dying from hunger, they just walk past you. Here, Carolientje. You go finish that drawing. Can I have a cookie? She ate all the cookies again. Eat till you burst! 73.75. That isn't even enough for a scooter. You don't know what Willem has earned. He has a real job now. Willem? Yeah, you bet! He's working at the supermarket. - How much do you have, Willem? - That's all. What happened? Someone stole empty bottles and the chief said I did it. Did he punch you in the face for that? No, but when he didn't want to pay, I said he could drop dead. And then he immediately lashed out. So 73.75. And for that we busted our asses. We have to think up other things. Jobs that pay more money. Well. That musical is our only chance. - Yes, but that'll take too long. - Do you know something better? - We could try it. - No! Carolientje. Carolientje! Yuck, what did you do now? Circus, and I'm a clown. And this is the tiger. First class, Anja. They can't beat this in a 3 star restaurant. Stew of uncooked endive. And exactly as your mother made it. - Can I have another lager? - That was the last one. Oh, small mistake, girl. Always ensure there's enough lager. I had just enough money for the other shopping. How could I know the money is gone? When the money is gone, you have to tell me. Come here. You're doing great. I wouldn't know what to do without you. Give me a smile, it makes you'll look much prettier. Don't you think so, Liesje? What the hell! What happened to that cat? Sorry. I forgot to clean him. Clean? Who did that to the cat? Well, Carolientje played with him. - We were in my room and didn't notice... - Which Carolientje? Ronny's sister. Ronny had to look after her. - Her mother had to leave yesterday. - Yeah, sure! Mothers going to work and just leave their children, huh? Your mother would never have done that. She was where a mother belongs. At home with you. By the way, all that running through the house must stop. It's not a pigeon house here. - I'm right, or maybe not? - Do I have to sit here on my own all day? No of course not. That's not what I mean either. Can't you play somewhere else? Why always here? - You can't play in an apartment. - Nonsense! You don't even want to live in a flat. Yes, that is something else. Why don't you play in the barn behind the house? - Can we? - Yes, of course. It's empty for the time being. Just so the running around stops. - Very good. - Yeah, sucking up, right? Better clean up that animal.

And we also need new lights. We still need so much. Do we still have money? What do you think those sockets cost? Can't we borrow things from home? Let's write everything we need in a notebook. Yes. A typewriter for the text. - I can borrow one from my mother. - And microphones! - An amplifier. - And what do we do with the paradise? - We'll paint it on canvases. - Yes, I can take care of that.

Hey! Are you done with the bull shitting! Old nutter, shut up! And who said that? Scum like you can't talk to me like that. Every day it's the same bullshit here. Piss off to the trailer park and go bully your mother. I know when I smell a rat! - To be rude with me. - That wasn't them. - But I heard it myself. - That was us. Yeah, yeah. Speak up for that riff-raff. But remember that I'll put a stop to it. You can take poison on that. Scum! And remember, you too. "That was us". Dirty traitor! - You're a mean bastard. - Yes, and you can't even stand a joke. Drop dead with your jokes. If you find that funny, then sit on it. Come on, Erik, be a sport. Oh, just let him. He's like my father: Running off if he can't get his way. Damn, bully! Ronny, Erik. Stop it. Hey, stay there. So, and whoever opens his mouth once again, I'll kick out of the apartment myself. Don't let me hear you again. If he takes part, Then I'm out. But Ronny said it was a joke. Yes, but he kept his mouth shut when those kids got nailed. If Verschuur had touched them, Ronny would have said something. Hey, don't be that way. You know we don't stand a chance with that new song without you. - So what? - So what! - Bitch. - Ass. - Jan, did you use the typewriter? - No. How strange. - Wow. - So, that works fine. - Real pretty! And now my lights. - Oh, very good. - Fantastic, man! It's a pity that the light-bulbs are white. - Well, we can paint them. - I still have yellow and green paint. So, put a light-bulb in. Hey, I thought I had light-bulbs? Ah, hello Janssen. Do you have a 60-watt light-bulb for me? - Yes, of course. Walk along. - Okay. Damn! I don't have any light-bulbs left. No, I would like to help you, but I don't have any light-bulbs. But now that I see you, my radio doesn't work anymore. Would you want to take a look at it? Oh, that's good. I'll come get it later. Nice! Light-bulbs, I'm not crazy! ♪ And even the last tuft of grass ♪ On a square rigid and stiff lawn ♪ It's the city of shock concrete Well, how did that sound? Well, not bad. But I've got to think of something else for the lights. - Hands off! - Well, it's not the right one. Verschuur can forget it. That radio is completely ruined. I quit. Hey, you'll be coming up soon too, huh? You should've been in bed a long time. Say Arend, did you take those sheets? - Me? - Or did I... No, I know for sure. How can they be gone? Strange things are happening here. I think this is it. Too bad I can't check if it works. - Hi. - Hey. - Did you think of the mirrors? - Oh gosh, no. - Well, never mind. - Do you have a screwdriver for me? - Why, what do you need it for? You'll see. I'll be right back. So, now I'm a real press photographer. Careful with it, huh! My father is very protective of it. And if he sees that I pinched it, I'll catch hell. Hey, Jan, stop the whining. Plug that power cord into the outlet. Hey retard, watch it with that thing! Hmm, it's the other one. Let's try. Wow, far out. Fantastico! Look, do you see that? Fantastico! Come on, guys. Let's rehearse. - He's got his moped back. - Who? Yes, Maarten. I just saw him driving to the trailer park. Hey. Is Grandpa De Graaf here? My father? No, he's picking up some stuff for me. Did you get it back? Yes, of course. I didn't have anything to do with that accident. What are you doing? Ah, the kids are playing cowboy. No, the kids are playing pop-musical. - That's no longer necessary. - Pop musical! With a toy gun. ♪ The city is terribly criminal ♪ Shock shock shock shock, shock concrete - What's so ridiculous about it, man? - You don't pull a gun like that, man. - Like how? - Like this, get back! Come on, move. Everybody gets back! Get back! Hey! Did you really take a shot? - Oh sorry, it happened by accident. - Yes, but there's film inside. - Well, one picture isn't that bad. - Come on, give me. Darn, Maarten. It looks so real. Yes, Maarten. Can't you help us? - Who, me? - Yes! - With rehearsing and stuff. - Not me! I'll see you when it comes on TV. Ah, how convenient. I'm sorry, Verschuur, I spent the whole evening on it, but it can't be repaired. Oh well, then I'll get a real professional. Burn in hell. My mirrors. They've stolen my mirrors. My radio. Didn't you feel well, Verschuur? Those scum were here again this afternoon, were they? Tell me! - What scum? - What scum! The scum of the trailer park, of course. The scum that's always wandering about here. Scum of the earth! You'll get yours, old-timer. You'll get yours. My radio. But we can't do that, Verschuur. A signing action to get De Graaf out of the flat here? No, I'm sorry, but I find it almost anti-social. Anti-social? That's the limit! Those guys are anti-social! And since the old-timer lives here, the scum go in and out like they own the flat. Yes, but they don't do anything? Oh no? Then you haven't lost anything? You won't achieve anything with this. It only spoils morale. Shall I go talk to De Graaf? - You can't talk to that man. - Oh, yes. And who knows, maybe he'll leave soon. - He has that flat only temporarily. - Temporarily? He's lived here for almost a year. Just stop this. I'll talk to him first. Yes, you go talk to him. After all, that is your profession. I'll do it my way. Me going back? I'm better off here than in that damp trailer. Chess. My bronchitis is hardly bothering me anymore, Jaap. At first that was an option, but now that I am here I don't have to go back. - How so? - Oh, just being neighborly. After all, we live in the same flat. Are there people who don't like it? Oh no, why would you think that? Yes... it's only... Only what? Some people just like it quiet. Am I so rowdy? No, that's not what I mean. But I think that those kids who sometimes visit... Well, that's from Verschuur. That guy is always nagging. I can receive who I want. I'm not in prison here. And the kids of the flat are making a lot more noise than Sascha and stuff. Ah. Maybe it's just that some people have to get used to it. Getting used to what? That I live here? Well, then they'll get a lot more to get used to. Do you know my brother-in-law? You must have seen him. Bold head. He drives a big American car. He has been struggling for years with rheumatism. And that surely is because of his drafty trailer. Last time I said to him: Man, why do you stay in that trailer park all this time? Sell ​​that trailer and come live in a flat. Well, he was quite attracted. Doesn't Van Beek's flat come empty next month? Yes. Oh wait, that's next to your flat! Oh, but he'll make a good neighbor. And you can have such fun with my brother-in-law! Stop, we have to go back immediately! There's a meeting about us this evening. - About us? - Yes, dude! About things disappearing. They are furious. His mirrors are stolen, his radio is stolen. The radio wasn't stolen. He threw it off the gallery himself. Where are my sheets? There, painted. Darn! - How can I return them now? - Those things can't be returned. We'd better make sure that nobody sees them here. And we have to find out what our parents know. - Where will they meet? - At my home. - Well, then you're there yourself. - Yes! - Everybody coffee? - Oh, delicious. - Tea for me please. Oh guys. I just spoke to Piet, it's all arranged. He drives us to the South of France with the trailer, and the price... Well, it's not that bad. What did I tell you? Nobody wanted at first. But this is so much better. I'm glad that you're finally getting a bit more environmentally aware. Just some reflection on what we're doing together. Yes, and it saves a lot in the cost of petrol. Well, I don't really know if I still want to come along. I find the mentality in the flat a bit, well, I don't know. - I don't like it very much. - Well, what nonsense. It's so nice for the children. You won't let us down, will you? That you don't all go on holiday in your own car, I find in any case a very positive development within this flat. The newspaper should write about that. Open minded flat on vacation. Sorry people, but I have a job to do. Ah, coffee! - Get sugar and milk yourself. - Say Jan, it's all arranged with Piet. - He'll drive the campers to France. - Fantastico! Then I don't have to get my car checked. Are we here to talk about the holiday, or... Or... Ronny come on. Go play outside. Oh, why? He's not in my way, you know. What nonsense. On other nights we have to drag him off the street at 9:30. Come on, Ron! Hop hop! Well. - So? - They sent me away. Sent away. We need to find out what they're discussing. Because if they know what we did... Yes, but didn't we just pinch small things? - Yeah, and that moped? - Hey, wait! - You got something? - Come on, Bennie. I think it's nonsense. These are only suspicions. - We don't have any proof. - And my mirrors? And my radio? That things are stolen is a fact. But this is really stealing, dude! No nonsense, we'll return that stuff later on. Got them. Look, come on. I fully agree with Anna. And legally we don't have a leg to stand on either. The theoretical intellect is speaking to you. The only shame is that you're turning a deaf ear. - Too low. - Too bad. Let me try again. No, Erik. He was very close. Yes! Renée, you tie that thing! Well, you can think what you like, but I won't rest before that riff-raff is gone. They're all good for nothin'. Have you ever seen those guys work? And they drive around in those big cars. Where they steal the stuff I don't care. - As long as it's not with me. - Asshole. Keep your hands off. That button is for sending. No. That's the limit! Now look what's hanging here. I'll be damned, we have ears on us. Who would want to eavesdrop on us? Well, it's clear to me. Those are army surplus. They all have that stuff in the trailer park. Yes, but that thing is mine! It's from my basement. And I'm sure it was locked. Anja! Anja? Where can that child be? Anja! I still think it's nonsense. I won't participate. Yes, personally I have nothing against those people, either. No of course not. None of us do. No? But I do. But... If we're even being burgled. I really think it's a bit of aggression from those people, isn't it? Those people don't live in these trailers for nothing. They want their freedom. And here they are locked up in between the flats. Come on! I think that they eventually... will be much happier at a different location, I'll take off tomorrow afternoon. Take some pictures in the neighborhood. Then we will present the matter to the municipality. ♪ Oh, a city slicker is a wretch ♪ And furthermore a fool ♪ Always rushing, always hurrying ♪ Without ever seeing ♪ That nature is like a dreamy journey ♪ That it's a piece of paradise ♪ Oh it is my sweet desire Hey guys, do you really like this? It should be more real. And why didn't the flowers work? I don't understand either. This one does. Obvious. Erik is standing on the hose. Oh sorry. - Can I have a cookie? - No! Come on. Just one. Well, just one then. But you have to go get it yourself. Not more than one, huh? I wouldn't try that if I were you. But you should see what they did. Who asked you to come here? We didn't order a photographer. Oh! You sympathize, huh? Probably your way of parenting. Your children come to no good. - Your kids never do anything? - No. At least not these nasty pranks. Okay, guys. We'll repeat from the start. I’ll check on Carolientje. Or she'll empty the whole cookie jar. Bang bang. Bang bang. Are you totally nuts? Where did you get that? - Hey, hands off. - No! - Hands off. Geez, what's taking Ronny so long? - Look what I've got. - Darn. Is it real? - Hands up. - Get a grip, idiot! They're shooting. Help! You shouldn't have touched it, idiot. I couldn't know that thing was loaded. - But Erik slammed my arm. - Yes, but you were aiming at me. We have to leave here. Nobody must see us here. - Let's clean up. - And what about the gun? Bury it. If the police finds it... they can check if it has been fired. In my bedroom. - Where, here? - Here! In my bedroom. If I'd been in front of the window I'd be dead. Well, I doubt it. The bullet barely had any speed. It must have been shot from quite a distance. - I hope nobody got hurt. - I hope so too. - What a bang, huh? - Where is Carolientje? - I don't know, she was just there. Carolientje, what's taking so long? Hurry up. Carolientje, you're not telling anyone? You know, if somebody finds out, then... Then we all go to jail. And you too. - And you won't get any cookies there. - To no one, huh? Well, for me it's plain as day. Yesterday those guys heard exactly what I said through that thing. And now I'm the villain. But I'm fine with it. I'm fine with it. Because that's an extra reason for us... to get that gang out of here as soon as possible. - Where have you been this afternoon? - Back there. So not near that trailer park? - No. - Great. Carolientje, come. No, I didn't see anyone there either. Well, I'll develop those photos as quickly as possible. So tonight we can see which prints to send. - Where is the meeting? - At Jan-Jaap. And he's preparing a letter for the municipality. Ah, let's drop it. But surely I'll go to that meeting tonight. So what about that vacation? If it were up to my mother, the trip would be off. But then Erik would be here on his own all the time. - And the other kids are going, of course. - And you? I'm going anyway. But I'm going on the moped. I just bought a map this afternoon. Is that what you do at your mother's? Good gracious! I didn't see that this afternoon. If that isn't proof. Verschuur must see this. - Well, kid, it’ll be a nice trip. - Sure. Come along! No, kid. I've been camping enough in my life. - Well, enjoy. - Yes. Will you come by before you leave? Yes, bye. Now you're busted, kid! Here. That's you, isn't it? - Well then! - What "well then"? You shot at Verschuur. - Me? - Yes of course! Here, look! I took that photo myself. - You didn't take that photo at all. - Oh no? Then who would've taken it? Kid, you're in trouble. - I haven't been over there all day. - Oh no? And where were you? With me. Aha! Two peas in a pod, huh? Well, it won't happen this time. Look here. Oh, that stupid photo has nothing to do with it. Don't think that makes a difference. I have the negatives downstairs. I'll just make new ones. And didn't you claim that on the morning of... that moped accident he was with you all the time, huh? It's your fault. But Ronny would put in another roll! That's none of my business. You made that picture! But didn't you tear it up? Ah, jerk. He still has the negatives. He can make new ones. And I'm screwed. Because of you, get it? - Because of you! - Yes, but I didn't know that... Man, you never know anything, ass! Why did you do that? And you want to say something about me? Why does Janssen think that you have something to do with it? He first has to prove it. Say... Didn't you have to attend that meeting tonight? Not me. It's crowded enough without me. I've lost everything. My photos up in thin air! Negatives: Gone. - How can this be? - Yes. Yes. Yes. It's no mystery to me who did that, you know. - Good evening. - Thanks. I heard tonight there's a meeting here of all residents. - Yes. - Well... Yes, because I happen to live here too. Yes. No, you completely misunderstood. Well, look, eh... Yes? It's about the holiday. We're going over a few things for the holidays. I didn't know that so many people were going along. You're not going either, right? No. But eh... I've done a lot of camping, and... I have a few useful tips for them. Oh, for that matter I could teach them a lot as well. Or let them go ask in the trailer park. They know everything about camping. And what about sleeping arrangements? - Renée and I are sleeping in a tent. - Yes. Do you know I think it's damn nice that they're taking you? If possible I'll pick you up a few days earlier. So I'll have a few days too. Do you know that I really don't like you to leave? Right, well for you but not for me. I'll miss you. What are they hauling around? Oh, just stuff. What kind of stuff? To play with. Careful man. Here it comes. Next weeks will be boring, Verschuur. - Be careful! - Yes. See you tonight. Well, kid, have fun. Greetings to Brigitte Bardot. And don't forget that bottle of cognac for me. Bye! - Anja, hurry up. - Yoo-hoo. Are you coming? I hope we keep it dry. What's that button for? Don't touch! Never touch that. ♪ All the ducks are swimming in the water ♪ Falderalderaldera ♪ Tra la la. ♪ All the ducks are swimming in the water Now shut up. This is a disaster. I need a car. What is it, Dad? Piet van Dijk's house, it looks like the Great Flood. Everything is flooded. It doesn't have an engine, Dad. What are you doing? I want to follow him. I know which route they're taking. And you call the police and the fire brigade. Wait a minute, Dad. Hurry up son. The whole lot is floating away. Hey, leave me alone. They're on top of me. Get! Get! Get! - How much is it guzzling? - Well, about 8 MPG. And how many gallons in a tank? 80. How can you see when the tank is empty? - Piet Vandehenke... - Shut up. ...DAF combination in the south of the Netherlands. Mr. Van Dijk is requested to... to contact the AAA Control Room in The Hague, that's 070 26 44 26. - Here, write down. - I repeat: Call for... Mr Piet Van Dijk... What's so funny? Something must have happened. Maybe Mother... or Jan? Maybe that Jan... God, I've got to call somewhere! There, at the cafe there. Hey Rinus! Rinus! Look at that! So, he's gotta go! Where is he going? Good day, can I make a call here somewhere? There, around the corner. And that's what he heard on the radio. Now he's calling about what happened at home. Thanks. - Hey wait a minute. - What? - 2 quarters. - Oh yes, I'm sorry. You can always try. What kind of people are these? My whole house got flooded. I've got to go back quick as lightning. And what about us? Go to hell with your "us". How do we get that stuff off? Take one of the transits. You'll be much faster than with your trailer. - Shall we unload? - Yes. Rinus, they're unloading! Well Piet, good luck and we'll contact you. Yes thank you. Mom, I have to pee. Well, this could take a long time. Well come on guys, don't nag. Let's make something fun of it. Okay. Ruud, get that parasol. - Oh, where is it? - And get out those chairs. Thanks. Those are good customers. I'd like to know what sort of guests they are. Oh dear! I think they're planning on staying for the time being. Can I use the toilet, sir? Look at that. They're setting up a tent. If they are not gone in an hour, I'll call De Waal. Well, I would do that now. You won't get rid of them any time soon. The driver of that semi-trailer has long since disappeared. Mister, you can't do this. This is a public parking lot! We can't let you put up caravans and tents here. Don't let them argue you out of your socks, De Waal. Mister, can I use the toilet? - Can't you read? - Yes. So what does it say on that door? NO TOLET You can't write! I'm not going to press charges, mister. But before sunset at the latest everything is gone, OK? Hey kids, careful with bare feet. There's glass here. - Yes, come on guys. Get it. - Heleen, here it comes. Hi, Maarten. Are you already here? Well, it's not that cozy here. No, I'm driving on. But don't be too sure that we’ll make it tonight. Hey! I'll manage. But what are you doing? Well, if Piet isn't back in time, we'll have to spend the night here. Oops, that won't get me far. Over there should be a village. There must be a gas station. Yes, thanks. Well, I'll see you on the way back, huh! - You're careful? - Yes. Bye. - Can I refuel here? - Yes. Marije, someone for the pump. - Hi. - Hi. Full? It can't get any fuller. Oh sorry sir. I'll clean it up. Well, just pay one guilder less. Are you crazy, those few drops. Here. - Are you going camping around here? - No. Well maybe. One night. 5 km away is a very nice camping site. I'll find something. Is there anything fun to do around here? No, never. But this afternoon and tonight there's a street fair. Maybe I'll just drop by. Who knows, I might see you then. What's your name? Maarten. My name is... Marije. Yes sure! They're putting up another tent. Look at that, Rinus. Another vacationer. I think they fooled De Waal in an incredible way. Look at that gypsy, man. Just imagine what kind of riff-raff the others are. Do you know what I'm doing? I'm going home... ...to lock everything down. Well, one cup of coffee. Then at least I... won't feel that I came for nothing. Okay. Milk and sugar, Grandpa? Hey, there are those guys from the trailer park. - Can we go past? - No. Get your hands off, dude! Hey, look at that. That boy is wearing a girl's blouse. - I'm not a boy! - Oh no? Oh, do you see that? She's a real chick: She's scratching. Hey, he let himself get scratched by a chick. Watch out. Someone's coming. Squid head! - Well, all the best. - Bye Grandpa! And I hope this is the only trouble... that you'll have all holiday. - Bye. - Bye. - I'll pay on Saturday, OK? - I'll write it down, Mrs Derks. - So, and you? - One white bread and 3 brown. - Do you have money on you? - Yes. - Can I see it? - Yes of course. Good. We can do business. That cheater inside asks one guilder for a bucket of water. I call that abuse of the situation. Well, this is completely ruined. Look, the bearings are stuck. How do I get a new starter motor here? Well, surely there'll be a garage in the village? I don't mean a new one. What do you think it'll costs? And I'm sure that my son has 2 or 3 of those. If Piet van Dijk is still at home, then he can bring you one. Just call him. Well, I'll do that in a minute. Can I have a bucket of water? And I'd like to make a call. At least you'll earn something today, Rinus. Well, I've put everything under lock and key. And if I were you, I'd also bring in the bikes tonight. Right, I know that well. Yes, but they're fine here! Okay, I'll tell them. Right. You just clean up the mess. Oh, Piet. Something else. I'm here with a broken starter motor. Do you want to ask in the trailer park if they have one for me? Yes, I think he has about 3. And if not: Bald Nelis. Yes, him in the yellow trailer. It'll be more like tomorrow night than tomorrow afternoon, he said. Well, we have to spend the night here. Let's organize something quickly. We could have been in France already. - And what will you do? - Yes... Can't you sleep in there? We should have a few spare blankets and sleeping bag. Did you seen what's in here? Well, it has to get out. Come on, I'll help you. They went in there. In that barn. How many? - Come on, let's go get them. - I mean, really. - What, don't you dare? - What good is that man? Didn't they beat you up too? And 6 against 2, the cowards. - Come on. - Be quiet. Listen.

Yes, that's right, that's what I played. - Who said that? - Oh, those trailer park guys. I wouldn't do that if I were you. - What are you doing here? - Just watching. Watching, with sticks? If we need an audience we'll say so. Get lost! Come on, guys. Ronny. Idiot! Did you want to fight? So beat it! Stupid that they are also taking part in the musical contest. We'll win anyway.

That way the meat gets burned. - When I traveled through Germany with my parents... - Yeah, yeah! Certainly very big wild boars, huh? You don't believe anything, eh? Say, where have you been all this time? Oh, well, eh, there. Here kids, take it. There's enough. - Whoever wants soup should come here. - Yes, here. Here. And don't grill any more meat, Maarten. We have enough. - Don't call too soon. There's the first free-loader. - Where? - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. It looks like we are not about to leave yet. - Well, no, look. The problem is... - The problem is that you're still here. And I have to call that public arson. Yes, but I explained the whole story this afternoon! You did. But gradually I'm starting to doubt that story. Wouldn't the driver of the semi- trailer be back in this afternoon? - Yes, he should. - But he isn't. That's why we just started to eat. Would you like to have a sausage? Right, mister. Hot! Just keep out of this, De Graaf. - At least they'll get a ticket. - Those guys don't care about that. They won't pay anyway. If De Waal doesn't get them out on his own we'll help a bit, guys. Sure. Well. I handled it for the time being. Yes, it's no wonder he's getting the wrong idea.. - How so? - Well, I mean... - Yes, what do you mean? - Oh, nothing. I'm off. Are you going off? Where can you possibly go around here? I'm going to the village. There's a fair. Bye! There's a fair in the village. You guys hear that? Who wants to come along? (They all want ice cream) - Strawberry. - I want strawberry. I want banana. Hey, don't go out of turn! There's those guys. Ladies, please don't touch everything. Well, can't we at least try it on? If everyone does that, I can't sell those clothes any more. Well, sir, we do have clean hands. Yeah, sure. But remember what I told you. Hello Mrs. De Wit. - Do you see something for you? - Yes of course. Aha. Shooting, that's my thing. Sir, please pay first. What the hell. Ah, good to see you. I called my district commander. You have permission to stay overnight. - Oh fine. - But be gone no later than tomorrow night. 7 PM. - Hi, you came anyway? - Yes, as you can see. - How long are you still working? - Half an hour. - Will I see you then? - That's okay with me. - Marije! - Well until then. - What does that guy want? - Oh, nothing. Now where is Carolientje? Hands off! Stay away from my sister! - I wouldn't do that! - Then watch the children better! I can't let my stuff be stolen. Now a round on me. That's rotten thing. You'll pay for that drink, buddy. It's not the kid's fault! Come on, people. We're leaving here. We're leaving here, kids. Maarten, we're going back to the caravans. Are you coming? No, I'm staying here a bit. Bye. Come. - Are you with them? - With whom? Well, with the caravans. Yes. So what? NO JUNK NO GARBAGE IN OUR VILLAGE - Look at that. - Good gracious! What happened here?!? Oh no, just look. All the chickens are loose. PISS OFF. GET LOST PIGS GET OUT What have we done to those people? - We'll set it up again. - Oh my tent is broken. We caravan dwellers! How do they get an idea like that? - I don't know. That's what they think. - And you? - Yes, not anymore. - We caravan dwellers. - That's ridiculous! - Yes. And... If it was true? I won't have this. It's a personal insult. If I were you I'd just wipe it clean. Idiot! Kids, I need my chickens. Everybody helps. You'll get a quarter a chicken. So, got you. Marije, continue cleaning up. Clean up, I said! And don't let me see you near my daughter. Remember, huh! - Yes, but... - Don't try sneaking either. I know where to find you, kid. - I'll break both your legs. - I wanted... Now fuck off! 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Got them all. Thanks kids! Pay. Pay. Pay. - Pay. - Well okay then. Psst, Anja and Renée. I found a place to rehearse. And I've got power. And I've got sleep. Hurry up. We have to bring the stuff before anyone notices. What was it? - Power. - Oh. - And when the farmer comes for milking? - Ah, he's only coming this afternoon. Come on guys, we're going to rehearse.

We've been working on it for a while. Or did you think we could do that in an hour? Well, it sure looks like it. - Just look at yours. - It look like a bunch of rabbit shacks. Those yokels have never been in a city. Try that again, farmer! Well, anyone who wants an egg has to fight for it. Say, where are the children? They wanted to enjoy nature, they said. Agreed. If you win... we'll tell you how it works with those flats and lights and stuff. If we win, you'll tell us how it works with the sun, snow and flowers. Yes, but who is the jury? Marije. She's our director. Okay, but there must be one of us, too. Maarten. Agreed. So at 5 PM. Everyone looks after their own things. And if you don't tell us, then we'll get a few more people... and bash all your stuff together. There is nothing to tell. We'll win anyway. No chance. We still have a few things to organize. All we need is a mixer, and detergent. But it's only for one afternoon. We'll bring everything back tonight? Of course, if we have those lights... then they don't stand a chance. The clothes also have to be finished. I'll get a sewing machine. Then I'll bring my father's tuba. Where have you been all this time? Oh, there. What you look like! What did you do? Oh, we ran. No, find someone else. But whom? Then we have no one. Marije will side with them of course. What's that name? Oh, Marije. She's their director. - Okay, I'll do it. - Great! - Are you coming right away? - After I've had my sleep. Oh no, I really can't leave here. If we can't practice a few times more then they'll win of course. Okay, I will try. - But not longer than one hour. - Okay. Those young ones, we haven't seen them all day. They're sent out on a raid of course. - Are they stealing? - Stealing? Man, everything that has gone missing in the village! But they don't have a chance with me. I've closed up the entire workshop. What's keeping Maarten? I'm going to get him. - Have you seen Marije? - No. - Have you seen Marije? - Marije? - And that bloke on the moped? - Neither. His moped is there. Idiot! Piss off before someone sees you. - But kid! - I really didn't do it. Quickly, give me that thing. Come on! You're saying you stood there watching. As true as I stand here. Just as I see him walking towards it, I hear a bang. So he couldn’t have shot. If it was a shot at all. I clearly heard a bullet whistling past my head. And you report with the local police immediately after the holiday. Understood? What, is that all? You just let him go! Yes, but what else can I do? There is no proof! Well, just try to find a gun here. You should try. That gentleman also says... Gone by 7 PM, huh! And not one second later! - Well, at 5 PM. - You bet, damn it. Lamp holders gone, cords. Lamps. Okay. Well, you know, huh? Yes, yes. 5 PM. 5 PM. We'll just beat them out. - So at 5 PM. - Okay, 5 PM, people. Tonight! 5 PM. Well gentlemen, 5 PM. Erik honestly told me all about it. But how that gun got here... Ah kid, don't worry. I hid that thing just fine. Geez, 5 PM already. I have to go. - Bye. - Bye. Say, I'd put something on. - It's going to rain. - I'll be already inside. - Bye. - Suit yourself. Closed. Marije! Attention, guys. You've got one more minute. - Is the village ready? - Yes, okay. - The city group? - Yes. No way. I need power too. Everyone looks after their own things, we agreed. Well I'll be darned! We came to collect our things. What do you mean? Which things? There's the mother of that rotten kid. Anyone opening his mouth gets a smack on the kisser. - Yes, but he wants... - And you too. - Whose shed is this? - My father's. So not yours. If you can use power, they can too. - Jury agrees? - Jury agrees! Okay. Who starts? Stop, stop! Stop! Hey, De Waal, are you with us or against us now? As a policeman, I have the task to protect these people. They have two hours left. Not at all. We want our things back. But that's ridiculous! Those things aren't here at all.
