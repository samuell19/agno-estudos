Hello, I'm Joe Wambaugh. For 14 years, this was my world. A good cop needs three qualities that can't be taught: common sense, a sense of humor and a bit of compassion. Weapons more important than a gun and handcuffs. Our story tonight deals with Detective Mike Mulich. On June 17th, 1987, this cop forgot that sometimes compassion is needed for oneself. Where should we start? Lunch, or dinner? Why don't you get yourself a good Italian wife? Then you wouldn't be hungry all the time. Why don't you give me yours? She wouldn't have you. Oh, a present for you. What? What do you got there? Not bad. Where did you get this? I took it off that bloated wino they pulled out of McArthur Park last night. I brushed the worms off. You're a sick man. RADIO DISPATCH: All units in the vicinity of 299 Beverly and 2 Adam 49 211 in progress in Western Payroll Services. 2 Adam 49, your call is code 3. That's right up the street. This is 2 W 57. Code 6 in the area of 299 Beverly in plain clothes. Get out! Get out, Mike! Get out! Run! Come on, let's go! This is 2 W... Get down, Mike! This is 2 W 57, officers need help. Suspects: two white males one dressed in blue jeans... Mike! Mike! Hey, watch it! What are you doing? Mike! Mike! Ah, man! Move, man! You all right? Yeah. All right. [GUNSHOT] I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm just a little nervous. You know, I'm... It's like I'm uptight I'm going to get through this, I know it. Come on, honey, come back to bed. Look. You wanted this to work. I wanted this to work. Let's face it it's not going to work. Dammit, Rita. I think our marriage is worth saving. We're married eight months, Mike. Not eight years. Be thankful. I mean, there's no house, no property, no kids. God knows there's no money to fight over. There's nothing to save. We got off cheap, Mike. Okay, at least, let's wait till tomorrow, huh? We'll talk about it then. I'm not willing to live with your ghosts anymore. That bed's just not big enough for all of us. Goodbye, Mike. Don't leave me, okay? Please. [DOOR CLOSES] -I told you, three o'clock! -Listen up, kid, you'll give yourself an ulcer. Mendelssohn. Who we got? We're dead. Mike, please, tell me you're sober. Okay, I'm sober. Now let's go get us a murder indictment. Glad you could join us, Detective Mulich. Your boss here has been kind enough to cover your butt for the past 30 minutes. God bless Eye-talian coppers. I'm sorry I'm late, but my mother died. Oh, no, I'm sorry. When did it happen? Twelve years ago this April. Let's hear what you've got. Be as brief as possible. Okay. On September 15, one definite slime ball named Sidney Joseph Raymond a.k.a. Mean Sid, entered the Adams Hotel at 9915 Pico Boulevard to consummate a drug deal with one Walter Simplat, a.k.a. Dumb Wallie. Skip. The drug deal went sour, and they started to argue about... Skip. Mean Sid stabbed the victim twice in the chest with an eight-inch buck knife. The victim turned and took another stab wound to the right buttocks... Skip. ...before taking the only escape route, which was an eight-story plunge through a closed window. The cause of death is officially listed as a fall from a high place. Hell, if he was stabbed, we wouldn't know it anyway. They had to take him away in pieces. -We've got a witness. -Who's a drug dealing junkie himself, currently on parole, with a sheet that includes perjury. Great witness! No murder one, no murder two... At least give us attempted murder and let a jury decide. Hell, let's get the creep off the street before he kills somebody else. I don't doubt the man committed the crime. But when we walk into a courtroom, we want to be 95 percent certain we're going to convict. -I'm just not comfortable... -You know, me and my partner have just invested three weeks of work to put this psychopath in jail. Now you're telling me you and your boss need a 95 percent conviction rate to get re-elected? I'm not comfortable with that. It's just one junkie killing another one. Right. Not even murder, yeah? Just ecology? Cleaning up the environment? Take it easy! Mike! Mike. Mike, the man was just doing his job, for Pete's sake. So was Manuel Noriega. Hey. Hey! That is the nature of the business. You get a paycheck. You're a cop not a caped crusader. All this must be my supervisor talking because my former partner would know exactly how I feel. I think you've been a desk jockey too long. Yo, Reno. I want one for me. I want one for Sparky. No, no. I'm buying. Please, to show my appreciation for you guys in blue going out there protecting me... Shh! You know, I'll let you in on a little secret. It ain't the bad guys that the cops worry about. It's cops like me that cops worry about. Ha! If that don't scare you enough, see these? They don't do you any good. Sparky, you always wanted to be a cop, right? They're yours. Hell, I'll even throw in the cuffs. Gee, Mike! Thanks! Hey, you're welcome. Now you go, you put some bad guys in jail. 'Cause I sure as hell can't. [LAUGHING] [DRUNKEN CHATTER] -How's he doing? -We need to pull the plug on him again. You don't need to come down. Hell, you got a family, too. Yeah. My kids are grown, Tommy, and Maria, she understands the situation. Go ahead. Go home. You're officially relieved. All right. Thanks, boss. Tommy. Yeah. Mike wasn't always like this. Before the shooting, well, he was something special. You know, he won't even talk to me about the shooting. And then he goes over and sits in front of the widow's house. Don't go in, don't talk to her. Just sits there like a damn ghost. And then he drives off. I don't know. When he's straight and sober he's the best. But then, he goes off. I don't know. I don't know. Sweetheart, at closing time, everybody is kinda cute. Hey, Mike. [GUNSHOT] [YELLS] [ALARM CLOCK RINGS] Geez, Mike, what are you doing out of your coffin? I'm looking for a transfusion. [CHUCKLES] What the hell is this! What's the matter? -This is not coffee. -It's just decaf, Mike, Janie got it for me. She says it wouldn't hurt any of us to cut down on our caffeine. What did you lose? Nothing. I just... I misplaced something. No big deal. Don't sit down. Drive-by just occurred. 1700 block, Rockwood Street. One dead. Another gang task force? Couldn't Crash handle this? Crash had two fatals last night, another one early this morning. They're booked solid. Sounds like another wild and crazy night. Yeah. Oh, Mike! Oh, I knew I put them somewhere... You and I, my friend, need to have a serious talk about career choices. Call my secretary. We'll do lunch. I'll do that. Real soon. Oh, you still chasing that burglar over on Wiltshire? Yeah. Why? If you get some spare time, I want you to sit on this place on Mantigua for me. It's a townhouse, and I'm interested in number 7. Who comes and goes? Thanks a lot. Yeah, sure. You don't stake out your own wife. And you're not my mother, okay? Okay, okay. Nice. [RAP MUSIC PLAYING] Morning. Morning. You on the primary call? Yes, sir. 0706 hours. His eyes did one big back flip, and he went flat line. -Hey, Tim. -I still haven't gotten those pictures from that stabbing over on Normandy. That's SWAT, Mike. ASAP, huh? [CHUCKLING] What is that big, ugly, throbbing thing sitting between your shoulders? It feels like it should have "Goodyear" written across it. When did you start working Crash calls? Well, I guess they want this one solved. We covered every inch of the block, Mike. Went all the way around. None? No casings. Usually these gang-bangers leave more casings around than peanut shells at baseball games. No witnesses, either. A lot of people heard a big boom, that's about it. Check out his pockets for Rolaids. I feel a bad case of heartburn coming on. One shot. Went in like a Volkswagen there on his forehead exited like an 18-wheeler out the back. Looks like he got hit with an elephant gun. One shot? Nice and neat for a change. Had a gang-banger last night with eight holes in him. Another had six. Beirut six. Rudy, that look they get in their eyes, right when the lights go out. Maybe they're looking into eternity. Yeah, well, whatever they're looking at, I don't want to see it. Look at this. It was stuck in his belt. I see he was also a businessman. Rock, about what? Five, six grams? How big's the splash? Three hundred and forty bucks. All in tens. Pedro Luis Madrid, 22 years old. He lived a few blocks from here. Home boy. Yeah, well, I'd love to stay and chat with you fellas but unlike detectives, coroner investigators have to work for a living. You take the gun, I take the rest. You call fondling dead bodies work? I thought it was more of a calling. Please bite me where I'm most tender. Okay. You're the ex-Crash cop, gang expert. What's wrong with this picture? Time of day, for one. Most drive-bys don't go down at seven in the morning. And they used a large-caliber weapon. Gang guys prefer small-caliber stuff 22s, 25s, 38s, 9 mm... Rule number one: just when you think you got the rules down pat they change the game on you. Let's ask some questions. Somebody had to see something. I'll take this end. -Pardon me, ladies. -We didn't see anything. Nothing. -Did anyone see anything, anyone coming, anyone going? -No, nothing. My name is Mulich. Detective Mulich. Yes, sir. Detective Mulich. It's not that we don't want to help. It's just that the gangs make everyone afraid. -They see you talking to the police... -Yeah, I hear you. You didn't happen to witness the shooting, did you? No. I was just on my way to open my shop and saw the police cars. Oh! Did you know the boy that was shot? Him? Just another Vato. [CHATTER IN SPANISH] [KNOCKING AT DOOR] [KNOCKING AT DOOR] [WOMAN CRYING] Senora Madrid? Spanky was my husband. This is his mother. Lo sentimos mucho. Hablas ingles? Speak English, Mama. My Spanky, he's a very good boy. When he got out of jail, he worked very hard. He pays our rent. [SPEAKS SPANISH] Do you have any idea who might have done this to your husband? Everybody knows who did it. The 187s. And they were paid, the bastards. You policemen are more helpless than we are. My Spanky will be avenged. They will pay. [PEOPLE ARGUING] Stop, boys, or I'll have them shackle your legs. Hey can't stand to be away from me, Tommy? I love you guys so much, I have dry dreams about you. Hey, Mikey. You taking good care of our home boys? I am, but it's frustrating. I spend all my time trying to break him of the bad habits he picked up in here. Hey, Dick. Does the name Pedro Luis Madrid ring a bell? No. Of course, my bell's been rung so many times, I wouldn't know if it's ringing or not. Is he the victim on your Rockwell Street drive-by? Yeah. How about your drive-by last night? Any of them involved? Vatos Locos vs. 187 Barrio Boys? Desert Street Winos vs. Black Shoe. Any luck? Not yet. They got over 600 gangs here now. Most of them pretty small, 10 or 25 people. Then we move up to the big boys, like the Vatos Locos. They got 1200 members. And that's just the ones with bonafide cards. Bang! Got him! Pedro Madrid, a.k.a. Spanky. This is definitely our boy. Listen up, people. Sometime over the weekend, the National Guard armory in Compton was broken into. Among the items missing are a case of hand grenades two dozen M-16 rifles and a dozen pair of combat boots. Captain! They take any Scuds? 'Cause if they did, I want my own Patriot missile battery. Knock them suckers out of the sky. I gotta get the hell out of here. I've got some place I gotta go. Okay. I'll catch you tomorrow? Excuse me, gentlemen. -You look like hell, Mulich. -Yeah? And that's just the outside. I'm with you, boss. You doing okay with Mike? Yeah. Why? Well, ever since that shooting thing, the guy goes through partners like Kleenex. Mike's had some problems. He's working them out. Hey. Did Rita happen to call? No. But some other woman did, though. Said she'd call back later. Spanky Madrid's rap sheet. Nothing unusual. Just your run-of-the-mill gangbanger. Well, I'm not a speed reader, so I'm just going to assume he was a bad boy. Hey, Mike. I got the medical examiner on the line here. They're posting your drive-by at two o'clock today. Pedro Madrid. Thanks. Wait a minute. I'll call you back. Pedro Madrid? This wouldn't be the National gangbanger they call Spanky, would it? -You knew him? -Well, about six months ago, we questioned Spanky concerning a drive-by on Valencia Street. Jose "Joe Loco" Sanchez got his head blown off, and Spanky was a friend of his. -Head blown off. -Yeah. One shot, splat. They cleaned it up with a hose. -High powered rifle. -We never recovered the bullet, but my guess is definitely a high caliber weapon of some kind. Did you nail anybody? NSN. Nobody saw nothing. -You want me to pull the book on it? -Yeah, I'd appreciate it. This is Alomar. One moment. Mike, it's that woman who called earlier. Mulich, Homicide... Yeah, it is. Yes, I do remember. Yes, I would be very interested. I understand. Why don't you meet me at Hollywood and Vermont across the street from the Hollywood carwash. Nobody will know you're there. Let's say about 20 minutes? Hollywood carwash. Thank you. The day is looking up, kid. We got a witness to our drive-by. We don't dare talk to the police where the gangs can see us. It took a lot of courage to meet with us. Thanks. The one who was shot walked right by my house. I was going to work. That's when I saw the two boys. I didn't pay much attention until this car came by, full of boys. They all started shouting, "187 rules," "Vatos number one." Lots of swearing. Did you see the car? It was dark blue with a picture on the hood. An eagle, I think. The boy doing most of the yelling, he came into the restaurant where I work. He wears cowboy boots made of snakeskin. They went up the hill, and then I walked just a little ways further. [GUNSHOT] One shot? Yes, and very loud. And then the other boy came running back down the hill. The other boy. The one from the car? No. The one who was walking with the boy who was shot. There was somebody with Spanky Madrid? Yeah. I thought I told you that. What did he look like? He was young, short, he didn't have a shirt on, tan pants. Like the gang boys dress, you know. Could you identify him if you saw him again? A woman, a friend of mine, called the police to get the gang boys to leave her building. They hang around, sell drugs, buy, you know. The police come, make them leave. Same day, two girl gang members come to her apartment and push their way in. She had soup heating on the stove. They girls, they took the boiling soup and poured it on her baby. I have children, too. The boy who ran off, he limped. I'm sorry to bother you, Mrs. Madrid. I know that you're still in mourning but no one will speak to us, and the only way we're going to find your son's killer is if someone cooperates. Now, what we're looking for is who might have been with Spanky when he was shot. We know nothing, Mama. Do any of your son's friends walk with a limp? I told you, we know nothing, nada. Nada?Gloria, please, take the baby next door. I do not hear what the policiasay. [DOOR CLOSES] Mario Garcia is the name of the boy who was with my son. He was born with a leg shorter than the other. They call him "Little Junior." And the woman that was here yesterday, the one that Gloria was arguing with? She's nothing but a whore. Es una putawho tried to break my son's marriage and then she comes to our door. Putais not good enough for that kind of woman. [KNOCKING AT DOOR] Teresa Ramirez? Who is it? Nothing. Just a salesman. What you selling? Time shares. [SPEAKS SPANISH] We're investigating the murder of a man named Spanky Madrid. Never heard of him. Yeah, well how about your wife? She know him? I know nothing. Over half of his brain is gone. No other signs of trauma to speak of. There's a small scratch on the forearm here but, other than that... Wait a minute! What's this? What? What you got? There's something under the skin. I didn't notice it before. What is it? Could be a fragment. You're the detectives. You tell me. Yeah, it's a fragment, all right. Looks like a piece of the outer wrap of a steel-jacketed bullet. See? It's too small a piece to get a caliber fix, but it looks like a metal wrap. Like you'd see on an armor-piercing round. Military ammo? Like maybe an M-16? Like maybe from the National Guard armory in Compton? That's an interesting thought. Think we'd better find the rest of that slug. There you go. How you doing, boy? I'm wasting my time. So far, I've found an earring, 17 cents, and 15,000 beer bottle caps. We're trying to locate that slug from our drive-by. The way these yahoos shoot up this neighborhood, they oughta use recyclable bullets. Oh. Do me a favor, will you? If it means I don't have to work or gut you somebody's lame dog. No. Put out the word that I'm looking for a 187 Barrio Boy who drives a new blue car. Possibly a Trans-Am with an eagle design on the hood. The driver wears snakeskin cowboy boots. I'm also trying to locate a Vatos Loco named Mario "Little Junior" Garcia. Eighteen to twenty, five two, 110. Walks with a limp. He might be my only witness. I'll do her. You wanna do a couple of beers, tonight? Yeah, why not? Mike! What was that about a needle in a haystack? You actually found it? [LAUGHING] When I was born, God asked my mother whether she wanted me to be handsome or lucky. She said, "Both." [LAUGHING] Yes! Way to go! Made any progress on your drive-bys? Well, we've got a high-caliber slug, if SID can tell us what it is. We've got a witness if we can find him. We've got an irate husband. Nothing like a cheating wife to bring out the worst in a guy. You can ask me, I'm an expert. Well, if this thing turns into a dead horse, don't keep kicking it. People out there are dying for our business. I need your bodies. Hey, Andy, here's the interesting thing. About six months ago a good friend of our victim, a guy named Joe Loco, turns up dead. One shot, high-caliber weapon, early a.m. occurrence. -Makes you think, huh? -Interesting. Keep me up to date. Hey, Mike, some cute little process-server wanted me to give this to you. -Thanks. -Rita called. Said it was important. Yeah? Another subpoena? What trial? Mine. -What's with him? -Rita served divorce papers on him. Wait. I'll catch you later. Mike Mulich, this is Dr. John Carillo. John, this is Mike. Look, I've got a patient in recovery I'd better check on. I tried to call you today to let you know that you were going to be served today. I'm sorry you weren't in. Yeah? I thought we were going to try to work this out. No, you did. Not me. There's nothing to work out. It's over. Just let it go. I don't want to let it go! Dammit, Rita, I think that our marriage is worth saving. I know that the hours in Homicide, they're crazy, so I promise. I'm going to ask for a transfer into a different department... Mike! It's not the hours. I'm a surgical nurse. My hours aren't exactly normal. And it's not your job, it never was. Then what is it? What the hell is it? I think we both know what it is. You're so overwhelmed with guilt. You let it control your entire life. You can't even make love to me, for God's sake! Oh, God! Here we go with the psychological insights again. Fine! Don't face it! All right, Mike, don't face it. Just walk down to your cop bar and drink yourself into a stupor. Because the truth is that that dead cop is the only company that you keep. That's your life, not mine. Not anymore. I need you. Mike, when I first came into your life, you had just driven your car through the front window of a K-Mart. Besides a hell of a hangover, you had three broken ribs a concussion, and you needed a nurse. You still do. But I'm a nurse here all day long and, when I go home at night, I just want to be a wife. Goodbye, Mike. Have a good life. [CAR ALARM SOUNDS] Why didn't you tell me the truth, you bitch! -He won't go for it, but I'll ask. -Okay. See you tonight, baby. See you. Bye! CHILD: Bye! [HONKS HORN] How you feeling? Never better. Hey, Mike, a cousin of Delfina's just moved up here from Kentucky. She's living with us until she can find a place of her own. Name's Christine. Now, I was thinking, or hoping -that maybe you'd take her out. -What? -She's a sweetheart, man. -Look, Tom, Tommy, Tommy, a blind date? Please. No thank you. Give her a break. Her husband was killed in the Persian Gulf. An Army lieutenant. Tank commander. Took a direct hit fired from one of our own choppers. Friendly fire incident. Friendly fire. My, but your grip is awfully strong this morning! I just got a call from Rita. My God, Mike, you are damn lucky she called me and not the captain. You'd be looking at a suspension right in the face. Hey! I lost my temper, okay? No, it's not okay! What the hell is it going to take to wake you up? If you force her to get a restraining order, you're done, man, you're done. I will pay for the damn window. You bet your sweet ass you'll pay for the window and I'll tell you something else you're gonna do. You're going for help, Mike. What? You too? What is it with everybody? You all think you got my problems down pat? I'm not done. Look, we shared the same car for 12 years. We got no secrets. Now, you're walking the edge, man, and I am sick and tired of walking it with you. Me and the other guys in the squad room. We've covered for you long enough. Mike, don't you see what's going on? You're becoming the squad room joke. It ain't funny. Now, get the hell out of here. Mulich, Homicide. Hey, Tommy, Mike's, uh... You sure? M-16? Listen, the possibility's good enough for me. Thanks, and thanks for getting back so quickly. Bless you, my son. You're sounding better. Thank you. That was just SID. They said the bullet that killed Spanky Madrid was definitely fired from a high-caliber military type rifle, possibly an M-16. Great! Found this in the gang file. Yes! Little Junior Garcia, our missing witness. Get these blown up and into cars. The kid's the key. Without him, we've got zip. We got this. Oh, this is the jealous husband. Long-time Vatos Locos gang member. A real veterano. Our boy's done four years in Folsom for armed robbery and various weapons charges. He's currently on parole. Mike. Okay. Call his PO, find out if he's working. Her name is Dr. Janice Whitman. She's the... She's the department shrink, I know. She's big on ink blots. You have an appointment with her today at 5:30. And what if I don't keep it? Keep it. Hi, this is Detective Tom Alomar, Ramparts Homicide. I'm looking for the parole officer for Ramirez, Alfredo. Is he currently employed? Where does he work? Thanks. What? This is a little awkward, here. I, look, Al, I can be direct, or I can hem and haw. Go for it. We hear your old lady was steaming up car windows with Spanky Madrid. Hey, hey. Be cool, homes. Be cool. What my old lady does or doesn't do is none of your damn business. Your boss says you were a no-show the morning Spanky Madrid got shot. I had a cold. Still got it. Still into guns, Al? How about rifles? Military rifles? I'm a straight arrow now. Ask my PO. He checks on me every other day. Hey, Al. I like your new army boots. Planning on going into combat? So, about that thing we talked about? Thing? Thing? What thing? Christine, Delfina's cousin? Oh, come on, Tommy! Look at me. I'm 45 years old. I got gray hair, it's falling out. I got a pot gut, I got bags under my eyes. Look, you'd be doing this woman a disservice. Forget it, Tommy, okay? Okay, okay, different tack. I'm putting out an "Officer needs help" call here, partner. Things are a little crowded at home, you know? -My kids, Christine, her kid... -She's got a kid? A boy, five. And, with everybody around, it's... Look. The kids are going to my mom's, and I need you to take Christine out of my house for a couple of hours. So, as a favor to me, to save my marriage, would you please take her to dinner? Okay. Just this once. And don't ever do this to me again. I mean it. You're going to meet her at the Atitlan over on Alvarado at 7:30. I could kiss you on the lips. Mouth open. Oh, Mike, that's nasty. Oh, I don't even want to think about it. Good evening. May I help you? Oh, Detective Mullock, right? Yes, sir, Mulich. How did you know? Mulich. -I saw you on Rockwell Street at the shooting. -Oh, right, right. [SPEAKS SPANISH] I just bought myself a snack. So how are you doing? Fine, thank you. Is there something here I can help you with? Yeah, there just might be. I have this dinner date across the street. Aha! Here it is! Blind date. Well, the blind also appreciate flowers, you know. The smell... Oh, no, I didn't mean she was blind. Forgive me. I was just making a small bad joke. You can never go wrong giving roses to a woman, you know. The question is, how many? That is the key. Now. A dozen? No, that would be somewhat pretentious for the first date. A single rose? No, much, much too intimate. But three roses. Ah. One for her, one for you and one for your future. You sold me. That's a good-looking boy. Yeah, that's my boy, Martin. Rocco, you can go home now. Would you happen to know this kid? Mario Garcia, he belongs the Vatos Locos. They call him "Little Junior"? This one I don't recognize. He walks with a very pronounced limp. Did he kill that boy over on Rockwell? He was a witness, a friend of the deceased. Well, I'm sorry, I wish I could be of more help to you. So, how much do I owe you? Oh, no, really... Nada. It is my pleasure. If my roses help you with your blind date, come back and pay me. But, if they don't work, I'll take the loss. You're on. Thanks. Mike? What? Christine Avila. Hi. [SPEAKING SPANISH] What do we got here? Three winos? 187! [SPEAKS SPANISH] Vatos Locos! [GUNSHOTS] [SCREAMS] This is for Spanky, ese! -You want some ice cream? -No, I'm stuffed. But I'll watch you eat some. No, no. How long were you married? Eight months. No, you look up great husband in the dictionary, my picture won't be there. Rita's a great gal. See, I was a confirmed bachelor up until a year ago. And then, one day, I woke up and I was 44 years old, alone. I guess I took it as an omen. I don't know, maybe I rushed into it. Enough about me! What about you? Hopes, dreams, fears? Hopes. I hope I can give my son a good life. See him grow into a good man like his father. Dreams. I'd like to go back to college, learn about computers. Fears. Sometimes, I fear I won't forget the past and get on with my life. Here's my car. Well, thank you. I had a very nice time. Hey, uh, maybe we could do this again sometime? I mean, if you're not too busy? I'd like that. Christine? May I ask you a personal question? -Tommy said that your husband was killed by... -Friendly fire. Yeah. Did you ever think about the helicopter pilot? The American who fired the missile? My husband was a soldier killed in a war. What difference would it make if the missile had been fired by an Iraqi? Wouldn't make him any less dead. I've got to go. Thanks again. Good night. Hey, what's happening? Bill. Yo, Dick, heard you had a good one, huh? No, just your average inner city firefight. One of them had some kind of uzi. I mean, we picked up, count 'em, 57 9-mm casings. -Whoa. -Yeah, your victim's a 14-year-old 187 name of Cesar Munoz. Come and look at this over here on the wall. Vatos Locos. Definitely got a war going, guys. This could be retaliation for the hit on your Rockwell Street victim Spanky Madrid. Could be, or is? The shooter was described by witnesses as being a very short Latino male who walked with a pronounced limp. Little Junior Garcia. Ha! My bell's ringing! Ding, ding, ding! I love it when this happens, man. Just like in the movies. Ding, ding, ding! So you figure Little Junior was specifically after your victim? Hey, 60 rounds fired, we figure he was after anybody he could get. Yeah, well I hope you have better luck at finding him than we have. We're done here. We'll get him. We're going to go inside. We'll see you guys later, huh? Oh! We've got the go-ahead for the surveillance team on your ex-con Alamirez. All I had to do was mention M-16 rifles and combat boots. The captain was frothing at the mouth. Anything breaks, we'll let you know. Yes! Hey, Tommy, look over there. It's got an eagle on the hood. 2-W-5-7 requesting DMV check 2 Queen Robert 4-4-5. Roger. Here we go. Looks like a war party. Look at the big one with the boots. Hold it! Police! Hey! What are you doing, man? Police. Hey, I didn't know you guys were cops. Rafael Ruiz, age 22. They call you Crazy Cowboy, huh? So what are you? Crazy? A cowboy? Both? I'm gonna run him. Hey, Cowboy, you wouldn't happen to have a rifle in your trunk, would you? -A high caliber rifle? -High caliber? What does that mean? Oh, that's the opposite of low caliber. I told you, man, guns are against the law. I have no guns. Then you don't mind if I open up the trunk? No way, man. You ain't got probable cause, one, to search nothing. [LAUGHING] I know the law. Hey, you wanna handle my divorce. Hey, you wouldn't happen to know a guy named Spanky Madrid, would you? Who? Spanky Madrid. The only thing out on him is a $100 traffic warrant. -Warrant? -What did I tell you? You got nothing, man. Oh, yeah? Watch this. Pop the trunk, Mike. No, Tommy. We can't do anything illegal. I'll tell you what I got to do. I got to take you in on the traffic warrant. -I'll post bail in two hours. -Yeah, I know, but the thing is, Cowboy I'm going to have to impound the car. I'm going to have to have it taken downtown. What? No, no, that's okay. My home boys will take care of it for me. No, you see, we leave your car sitting out on the street, some bad guy comes along busts up the window, I couldn't live with myself. Yeah. A lawyer like you, you'd probably sue the city. Who the hell did that? Hey! All right. They're here now. Thanks. Somebody just posted Cowboy's bail. He'll be back out on the street in about 30 minutes. Well, that's par for the course. You think Cowboy pulled the trigger on Spanky Madrid? Calls for a little creativity then, I think. -What? -You still have that spare shirt in your locker? Within bounds, of course! Come on, people. Somebody spot it! Never a cop around when you need one. All right! Back off, Tommy. [SIRENS] Ah, man! -What did I do? I wasn't... -Can I have your license and registration? And please step out of the car, sir. Man, I don't believe this! I wasn't doing nothing, man! I wasn't speeding or nothing! Would you step back here, sir? Right back here, please. That's fine right there. Would you like to tell me what that is? What the... I... Somebody must have put that there. Could you open the trunk, please? Open the trunk? But...ah! I know, one of my friends. This is a joke they played on me. So why don't you just pop the trunk and show us that there's no body there then you can go and have a bunch of laughs with your home boys and me and my partner here can go have ourselves a donut. Body? There's no body! You're wasting your time, I'm telling you! Get the key. Get the key. I'm telling you, ese, there's no body! That's it, sir. Be quiet. Step over here, please. Slowly, slowly. I hope you're right. [WHISTLES] Put your hands over your head, right now! WOMAN COP: Lying, lying and more lying. What's going on? They did it, man! They put that rag on my car! They probably planted those guns, too! Don't you hate a sore loser? We got a war wagon here. Check this out. -2-2-3. This slug is very close in weight to an M-16. We've also got enough weapons violations here to keep him on ice until we can get this to SID. Keep your fingers crossed, Tommy, we just might have our killer. Hell of a bust, officers. Thanks! Oh, Tommy, can you get this rifle to SID? Sure. I'll drop it off on the way home. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Mike, Delfina wants me to bring you home for dinner tonight. Oh, tell her I appreciate it, but I can't tonight. I'm telling you, Mike, her and Christine make Mexican food like you wouldn't believe. I got something I gotta do tonight. I will take a rain check, though. All right. Some other time. Come on, honey. Get cleaned up. I'm telling you guys. Retirement is something I wouldn't recommend. I wouldn't waste your time on my mother-in-law, god rest her soul. [DRUNKEN MUMBLING] What? Reno! Look at this here! I'm empty! Mike, that's it. You're done. No more. What? I'm done? I'm fine. Look at me. -He's fine! -So give me the test. Give me the test. [ALL TOGETHER]: Test! Test! Test! You got it. Here. No, no help. He's got to load it himself. All right, I can load this myself. I know I can load this myself. He's not ready. All ready on the fire line! Ready? Locked and loaded! Make my day! Come on, Mike! [CHEERING] [LAUGHTER] I didn't fail. I always hit what I'm not shooting at. Hey, Mike. Easy! It's only a game, partner. It's only a game. It's only a game, partner. That's what it is. It's only a game. Hey! Mike? Hey! You're the guys! You're watching my old lady's place, huh. -So what's she up to? -Listen, why don't you go home and sleep it off, all right? I know what you're thinking. You're thinking, "The guy's old lady, he's... "She's bouncing on the mattress with somebody else..." -Nobody's thinking anything. -Well, I don't need that bitch! I don't need anybody. Hey, Mike, why don't I just drive you home? Mike! Cool it! You wanna drive me home? Easy, easy easy! Come on, cool it! Calm down! I know you feel sorry for me! You know what? They're right. You're nuts, Mulich. There's something wrong with you, man. -You ought to be suspended. -You guys made your point! Move out! Okay. Relax. Come on, Mike. Let me take you home. Come on. [BUZZER SOUNDS] Mike. Hi. Hello. May I come in? Yeah, sure. Come on in. Tommy called and said you didn't show up for work today. I tried to call, but there was no answer. I thought maybe you'd like somebody to talk to. To tell you the truth, I'm just about talked out. Well, good. Then you won't mind me talking. Do you have coffee in there? You asked me a question the other night. About the friendly fire. It was a stupid question. I'm sorry I ever asked it. I didn't realize until later, after I spoke to Tommy... -Do you take anything in your coffee? -No, black. The officer that you shot. Did you ever talk to his widow? Face to face? No, I didn't even go to the funeral. I... I tried to go to see her, but I can't do it. You're so tough on yourself. What? If Tommy accidentally shot a fellow officer, I'd be willing to bet that Mike Mulich would be the first one down there to offer comfort. Yeah, but I was careless. I was stupid. I should never have fired the shot that way. I was... You were what? I was scared. My husband chose to be a soldier. The man that you shot chose to be a police officer. They both knew the dangers. When people go off to war, they don't all come back. You have to honor the dead. By living your life as fully as you can. -You gotta start somewhere, right? -Yeah. If you're telling the truth, you shouldn't mind going through it again. Now, what were you doing cruising Vatos Locos territory if you weren't looking for trouble? Riding, man. I'm tired and I'm hungry, man. We've been here three hours. Look, I told you. I saw them, we yelled. They yelled. They took off running. We drove off. Ask my friends, man. Yeah, I will. I will. Just stay put. -How'd it go with Cowboy. -Well, he's sticking to his story. -How about you? -I've talked to all four of the guys in the Trans-Am. They all back his story. Yes, we were yelling. No, we didn't shoot nobody no how. You buy it? What's to buy? We got diddly. -We still got the rifle. -Wrong. SID just called with your ballistics report. -Cowboy's rifle was not the murder weapon. Sorry. -Dammit! Man! You feeling all right? Yes. Why? What! Nothing. You look almost human for a change. Well, I'll be damned. Good, old fashioned lousy coffee. I should have known. It's generic, Mike. Generic. You've got no taste buds left. None. Hey, Mike! Squad room 17's been trying to raise you on the radio. They want you to meet them over at Marathon and Vermont. They said it's important, as in, "Get your butt over here now, y'all." I should have known. It's a donut shop. Well, you know what they say. If you need a cop, don't call 9-1-1. Call 1-800-donut. -So what you got? -We busted come car strippers earlier this morning. They had a brand new Buick Regal up on blocks. Tires off, doors off, seats out. I was talking to one of them. He was all of 13, mind you. He told me he'd give me something good if I let him walk. I let him walk. Jimmy Garcia. That's his girlfriend's address. She knows where he's at. -Whether you get her to talk or not, that's your problem. -Thanks, buddy. All right. Pull around the corner. Let's see if we can locate a back door so we don't spook anybody. Geez! -Who is it? -Hey, lady, your cat was hit by a car. Better open up. He's hurt very bad. Angel Santos? What do you want? He's on the roof! [GUNSHOTS] Son of a bitch! Stop, dammit! [GUNSHOT] Out of my way! Police! [SCREAMING] Johnny! Johnny! Take it easy! No! You killed him! [POLICE SIRENS] Hey, Mike? Yeah? I'll see you in there. All right. Yeah. Hey, Mike. I heard about Little Junior. That's a real bummer. Now I got more bad news. I wanna hear it. Your irate husband, ex-con Alamirez? Well, while Little Junior Garcia was getting his radical lobotomy, we had four guys watching Alamirez wheel the barrow. -Did you guys find anything worthwhile at the scene? -No. No. Incredible. Oh, guess what? You know the missing M-16s, grenades, et cetera from Compton? Army called. They found them up at Camp Roberts, man. They were never missing. Never, ever, missing. Excuse me, sir. Scratch Ramirez. Damn! Cowboy's out, too. He was in custody all day. Go ahead. Good. Thanks a lot. Ballistics is 95 percent certain that the bullet that killed Little Junior and the one that got Spanky Madrid were fired from the same rifle. Definitely an M-16. What are you doing? I don't know. I'm just playing. Joe Loco, Spanky, now Little Junior. Three amigos. I wonder what they have in common? I mean, besides large-size holes in their heads. We're missing something here, partner. We are missing something. Tommy. Mike. Get all your stuff together on the Madrid case including the Little Junior shooting. It's all going to Crash. What? What are you talking about? This is our investigation. This is not a debate, Mike. This is all gang related so it's going to the gang task force. Crash is better equipped for it. Besides, I need you guys elsewhere. -Come on, Andy! Where was Crash... -End of discussion! Tommy, put those files together now. Mike, step into my office. I want to talk to you. Seems one of our fellow officers had to have his lip stitched the other night. Seems somebody I know stepped over the edge. Yeah, I'll talk to Mathews. I... I also called Dr. Whitman's office. They told me you missed the appointment -the other day. -Slipped my mind. I had so much... Well, I made another appointment. Monday morning, 10 a.m. You miss this one, Mike don't bother coming in on Tuesday. Just go downtown and turn in your badge. What? No chicken dinner? No gold watch, no party, no bad jokes? Just like that. Just like that. So we'll get the next one. Don't sweat it. Tommy, I hear they're opening a couple of Homicide chairs in Crash. Maybe you should throw your hat in the ring. I mean, with your background... What? You're gonna retire? You're gonna quit? Die? What? -What is this? -What? What are you looking at? Spanky Madrid's rap sheet. Look right here. Do you know what this is? Oh yeah, yeah. I saw that the other day. I thought it was a typo. What is it? No. This means that our boy Spanky did something that was later expunged from his records by order of the Juvenile Court. Marilyn Butler. She still work the Juvenile desk? -Yep. -She still got the hots for you? Come on. Well, I... Mike. I don't think we should... If I show you guys sealed records, I could get canned. But, if I open it, and you just happen to have some questions... Bingo. Here it is. Okay, you guys, here goes. Oh, wow! What? What is it? I know this one. The Echo Park shooting. This was one of my first cases. A kid with a baseball mitt. A 12-year-old boy was playing baseball in Echo Park with a bunch of his friends. Some kind of gang fight goes down clear across the park. A big shoot-out ensues. Of course, not one of the gangbangers gets hit. But this poor innocent kid gets a stray bullet right through the back of the neck. So Spanky Madrid was one of the shooters. There were two positive IDs. Both Vatos Locos. One was Spanky Madrid, and the other one was, uh. He had kind of a strange name. How about Joe Loco? Joe Loco! That's him. So they take these two guys to court. They can't prove that either one of them fired the fatal shot. So they walk. Later, Spanky petitioned the court to have the charges expunged, and they were. Any mention in there about a gangbanger named Mario "Little Junior" Garcia? No other gang member was ID'd. You got tall ones, short ones, fat ones. One reported to have a very pronounced limp... That's our boy, Mike. That's Little Junior. What was the victim's name? Martin. Martin Balsidar. [DOOR BELL] Ah! The three roses. They didn't work for your blind date? They worked fine, Mr. Balsidar. This is my partner, Detective Alomar. We dropped by your shop first. It was closed. Yes. I took the day off. May we come in? Yes, please. Planning to go out of town? Out of town? Oh, you mean the sheets. No, no. Since Marty died, I spend most of my time in the back. The sheets keep the dust off. Rosa, his...his mother... She died ten years ago and... Well, when she was around no dust. Not a speck. War vet, huh? Isn't that the Silver Star? Oh, that was a very long time ago. I think I was a frightened child pretending to be a man. Oh, they don't give the Silver Star to pretenders. So, gentlemen, what can I do for you? Would you like something? Coffee? A soft drink? No. No thanks. Do you own a rifle, Mr. Balsidar? Let me show you something. This is Marty's room. Rosa and I didn't think we could have children. Marty didn't come along until we were in our 40s. We called him our miracle baby. The animals who murdered him they weren't even punished. They left the court laughing. Laughing at my dead son. They killed my son. I'm so sorry. Mr. Balsidar, if you wouldn't mind, we'd like you to come down to the station with us. There's a few questions we need to ask you. A few things we need to clear up. Before we go, I would like to make a phone call. -To your lawyer? -To a priest. It's very important. Please! Sir, I'm sorry... We'll just wait out in the hall. What are you doing? He could have a gun in there. What are you thinking? -Huh? -I'm thinking that there are some things that a jury can't decide. [GUNSHOT] Oh, God! Mike! I gotta go home, mano. Wash all this off. See Delfina. Hold my kids. Hey. You wanna come home with me? No. No, thank you, partner. I got something I gotta do. Oh, and Tommy, I won't be in on Monday. Why? What? Something the matter? I got some ink blots to look at. I'll be in on Tuesday. I called. She's expecting you. Go on. I'll wait here. Wait. Don't forget these. How you doing? All right. [DOOR BELL] A cop can find a lot of satisfaction in his job. But an old sergeant once told me, "If you're looking for love "join the fire department." This is Joe Wambaugh. Hope to see you next time.
