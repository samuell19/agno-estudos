Sridhar, I’ve been searching for you. Santhanam asked me to bring you immediately to meet him. Seems to be a new movie and a popular company. Hurry up & hop onto the vehicle. What is this? I’m talking to you and you are lost in your thoughts? I need to go to office. For what? Do you need to meet anyone else? From now on, my work is in the office only. Sridhar what are you saying? It’s my brother’s friend’s company. I get my salary on time at 1st of every month. Previously music was my all time thought, now I wonder if i’d have time to even listen to it. This is not the right time for all the struggles, wait and trials. Hey dude, today also the same movie huh? It will be the same till I get a chance in cinema. For that only you went to chennai right. What happened? Huh.. Producer told me to make an hour pilot film with my story. If I had the money to make it for an hour, why wouldn’t I do it for another hour too. These are just excuses man. You need to stay there in Chennai and search dude. Only after that you will get the chance. Money? My parents are already nagging me what I’m going to do next since it’s already been 4 years. Relatives know that I’m trying for movies, but then too they would call and say that their son has gone for onsite, and ask me where I’m working? I don’t know what happiness they get in this. That is also fine. But someone told me she will be with me forever. Now, she has given me a deadline of 3 months. If I don’t come up with any films till then she’d be getting married to someone else it seems. I just left her. Am I a substitute for her? Only we know what we are going through. Dude since you are saying you are struggling, I’d suggest you a producer who I know. But his budget is very low. How much? 10 rupees man Hey my budget is only 1 yaar. Oye 10 rupees means 10 lakhs. Hmm mmm. Can’t do anything with this 10 lakhs. Look! Since you said it’s hard, I suggested. It’s not like it is impossible. You can do it. So far no one has tried, but we can. If you trust me call me. bye Sir, I previously told you about a guy right. He’s the one. Oh. 10 lakhs is the budget. Have you told him? Haan. Told sir. Ok bro. Tell me your story. Let’s not waste time Hmmm sir... First the opening scene, Human race came into existence 2 lakhs years before. From the time where he roamed around, naked in the sun to this time where he has settled with air conditioners, he has gone through various modifications. But if we reveal the harsh truth that God has offered him a precious thing which has traveled with him all through these years, through rains, storms and floods,they find it hard to believe. The troops which are guarding those treasures have also gone through various transformations. For the past 20 thousand years the organisation that has kept the treasure under its control is known as the “Zhagaram”, a tamizhan organisation. When we take a closer look at our history, we can see that whenever we are at the peak of our distress, this treasure had resurged, performing its duties. But If anyone tries to possess this precious treasure, their lives would be ended by the zhagaram organisation. Even now the hunt of zhagaram is still on Hello boss I have killed the target But, there is nothing as you said Okay you leave now I will take care Hello, srinivasan sir? Bro, how are you? I’m good sir. There’s a senior agent post available in our company. Do you know? ah yes sir For that, I have recommended you. Thank you sir, thank you sir It’s all due to your hard work. Sir it’s because of your blessings too. It will always be with you bro. Thank you sir, thank you sir. If you get promotion, you need to resign your job. Take care. This is a 50,000 salary job. If there is a delay in joining it will go to someone else. Sir, i’ll resign the job the next moment it is done. Take care. Bye What is this? You are coming early as usual? I’ve come right. That’s enough. Hey boss is calling you. Hmmm.. Ask Hmmm boss..... I came early itself boss... Ohh.. You saw the CCTV huh? I should come to your room now na? Ok boss. Go go.. enjoy. Hey he won’t spare me yaa. Oh God, what’s gonna happen. Sit down. What to do if you are late everyday like this? Boss.... that,... Look don’t interrupt while I’m talking. Boss.. For that you can talk alone. What? Wait wait wait... Hello.. huh tell me.. Okay.. okay.. Hmmm. What is this.. Srinivasan sir’s message has come... message has come... “Congrats you are promoted as a senior agent” Hmm okay.. okay.. What did you say? Tell me again. If I shouldn’t interrupt you while talking, you can talk to yourself right. Why are you troubling us? I don’t like this company. I’m resigning. Sir, tell me.. Just now I saw your message. I’m coming to join. Whaaattt!! Message has been sent wrongly huh? what wrong message ah? ok bro you will have more work, carry on. Which work? Hmmm.. My bad luck.. lost this one too. Looks like i need to earn making pakoras only. No, I’m a decent man. Begging is also a job it seems. Hello.. Who’s this? Please wait I’ll come. Akhil? Huh tell me.. My name’s sivagynanam. I’ve come along with Rajan to your home many times when you were young. Is it Your dad was abroad. It’s been 20 years. Now everything has changed. I heard Rajan passed away. Yeah uncle. He was fine only. He didn’t go out too for the past 2 months. That afternoon also he was in the library only. Don’t know what happened. It was a sudden heart attack. Library is his life and he lost his life there only. When you saw him for the last time, did he say any details to you? Regarding what? Regarding the burnt paper? What do you mean? Did he give any parcel to you, asking to keep it safe? Sir, what is this? You have been talking irrelevant things. What do you want? Cool bro. Listen to me carefully. Your grandfather was murdered. It’s all because of those burnt secrets of the yazhpanam library. I’ve come here to help you. Please tell me the truth Sir, my grandfather was delared innocent by the court in that yazhpanam library case. Why are you creating new stories? First leave from here. Shhh... Don’t shout. There are many people here. Someone might hear. Here this is my card. If you need any help, call me. I’ll rush immediately. Your grandfather was murdered.. Did he say anything about the burnt papers? There are many who are waiting to kill you too. It’s all for that secret. Doctor, there’s nothing to worry right? No no.. It’s just minor scratches. You will be alright after taking rest. Okay.. okay.. Mom.. mom.. It’s nothing mom.. I’ll be alright.. Mom.. It’s nothing to worry.. okay? He’s perfectly alright. He will be discharged in the evening. Thank you doctor. Okay akhil.. Take care.. Mom, I was driving safe & slow. The guy who came in the opposite direction hit me. Hmmm.. After that I don’t remember anything. did you find who hit me. Police is enquiring about this. But since its a remote area, they say it’s hard to find. Some good hearted fellow had called the ambulance. Not sure who that is too. History, ancient myths & mythologies.. hmmm...Why are we reading histories? History has left behind many hidden truths for us. Now the vel which you are seeing symbolises our knowledge. Our knowledge should be sharp, wide and deep. We all know about Leonardo Da Vinci’s Monalisa painting right? During those times when paintings were only on kings and queens, Da Vinci called a simple girl to pose as a model and painted her. Now it is just a simple example of an ancient lady. Everyone loves to see their name in history but history chooses only few. If you need to mark your place in history, you need to read it first. Haan.. Now everyone turn to chapter 4 in your books. Come carefully.. hmm.. Sit sit.. hmm okay.. Careful.. slow.. Just a minute I’ll come. Wait Dad. Wait.. Just a minute.. I’ll come.. Happy birthday Akhil. What is this new habit of presenting me gifts dad? Your grandfather wanted me to give this to you. His last wish was to see you, atleast once before his death. It’s alright.. Leave.. He told me to give this on your birthday. Hmm Thanks dad Okay.. You take rest. I’ve some work. I’ll come in a while. Akhil.. I know how much you love me.. But I’m not as innocent as you think. I’ve been traveling in search of a treasure for the past 20 years. There are many dangers around me. You need to do one thing for me, akhil. I’ve hidden the secrets about this treasure in a place. If those secrets are exposed people will easily get hold of it. So, please destroy those clues. And please don’t go in search of that treasure. I’m not sure if I’ll be alive when you are reading this letter but please do this for me as my last wish. Hello? What brother.. have the guys made you wait for long? Hello? who are you? What is this akhil? How can you end this now itself. The game has just begun. Hello!? who are you? Those things are not needed for you. Just listen to what I’ve got to say. I read that letter too. You are not gonna do what your grandfather has told you but what I’m gonna tell you. Before Chitirai 22nd i.e May 5th i need that treasure. Who are you man? Who are you to order me on phone? Stop. Don’t shout. See its sweating for you. There’s water near you, drink it. Hello.. What? Are you searching for any cameras? Dont worry. Just remember one thing, today’s accident is just a sample. I’m not like those movie villians who call you frequently to threaten you. Akhil, I’ll get to know even if you sneeze or cough. So act wisely. Or else, I wont wait till may month.. Your dad is buying tomatoes from the shop, your mother is frying Rasam in the kitchen. Hope you have understood. So, let’s meet on May 5th. How is that posssible dude? He even told about the water bottle. It’s all simple yaar. When everyone sleeps, they would be having water near them. He would have spoken in fright. By that he would have have said he was sweating. Mom means she will be kitchen only. He would have seen when dad went out. How many english movies we would have watched. This is just so simple. Okay.. What did your grandfather write in that letter? If people come to know about the treasure, they will fight with each other to possess it. Finally the human race will become extinct. Then this is not a simple issue. Hey where is that dice? What would this be? Hey he’s so eager than you. Arrey he’s got into some major trouble. he made this accident to show his power. Ask him to call now. Hey shut up. I’m scared. What is this man. You are getting scared for these things. If he calls you again, dude that would be his last call. Dude, when he calls forward his call to me. Who is he playing with. Hey it’s him. OMG! Hey hey hey don’t attend. If you attend only you will get in trouble. Look now you made him call. What did I do? What you didn’t do? Hey shut up. Let’s see what he says. Hmm okay What Akhil, looks like you are discussing about the treasure. Hmm why all are silent? Why are you three blinking hard? Hey Surya, atleast you can talk right. What are you looking at? You are the one with black T-shirt right? And that yellow t-shirt is our Sudharshan. Am I right? where is he? Whom are you searching for? You only asked me right? Haha.. Intentionally or unintentionally you yourselves got into the trouble. I just need the treasure. Give that to me and you are free to leave. Dont think too much. You have only 2 weeks time. I need that before that. Or else I can guarantee your lives. What are you thinking surya? You are jobless right? For safer side, save an insurance policy for you. Understand and behave. What is this yaar? Do something man. Akhil, what are you thinking? Not sure. We don’t have any other go. We don’t know who he is. how did my grand father died. What is that treasure? Who is that sivagnyanam? We can find the answers only we find that treasure. Yeah. Right. But where do we start? We dont know anything about that dice na? I think it will be better if we have an archaeologist with us. You know one archeologist right? Who? Sneha without seeing you, I’ve gone crazy after seeing you, I’m speechless The tunes of the monsoon the waves of the hand the blinding beauty You are all in one the flag at top of the roof the bell at top of the temple the dewdrops on the rock You are all in one Like the eyes expressing love Like the rain that sprinkles love Like the first line of calendar being love Will you live for me? Like Love is the moonlight in the dark Like Love is the laughter and the smile Like Love is the sand touching our foot You are born for me without seeing you, I’ve gone crazy after seeing you, I’m speechless My eyes are full of love Oh oh oh My eyes are full of love Speak for awhiile without any pause. When the wind blows, the doors will open Like the fingerprints let’s stay in love With the music of the wind Love becomes the song Like the eyes expressing love Like the rain that sprinkles love Like the first line of calendar being love Will you live for me? My love turns hot when alone My love turns hot when alone My thirst satisfies, if you are the rain When you walk on the road Like the blossoming garden flowers My heart blossoms. Eyes have taken their place On the chair of love. I’ve gone crazy without seeing you I’ve become dumbfounded after seeing you the tunes of the monsoon the waves of the hand the blinding beauty You are all in one the flag atop the roof the bell atop the temple the dewdrops on the rock You are all in one By the way you talk it doesn’t look like you are searching groom for your daughter, but a good son-in-law according to your status. Thank you so much. Akhil.. Akhil wait please Dad, I won’t marry anyone else other than Akhil and that will happen only after your acceptance. Hmm.. What mistake did i do? Hey who asked her to come here? Oye by the way you look at me, it seems that you are telling me that I’ve shared the location to her via whatsapp and asked her to come. I know everything Akhil. Surya has told me everything. Surya, i don’t need anyones help. Ask her to leave first. I wont leave surya He will say like this only. Here take a look at this. This is dice. Using this we used to play games like business, snake & ladder, aadu puli aattam. What did you say? Business huh? Yeah. Hey, my grandpa gifted me a business board on my 10th birthday. See, this is why I told you we need an archeaologist. Hmm mmm.. Why archeaologist for this? We could decode that oursleves. Hmm.. where is that business board now? Actually we need two dice for this. But we have only one. Give that. And when we take a look at this, only one side has 8 dots. The other sides are blank. Let’s do something. Search which place comes in the 8th place. Totally there are four sides. Where to go and look for the 8th place in this? From the starting point. Okay.. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8... Vizag.. Why did vyzag come? What is this dude, without any relevance vishakapatnam has come? No man. There is a relation. Before 2 years, my grandpa worked in vizag only. So, wee need to go to vishakapatnam now. Hey vishakapatnam is such a huge place. Where will go and search there? Our grandpa is an archeaologist right, we can go and enquire there. Okay. We will go and enquire there. Oh, so are we going to vizag? Surya only we three are going. Surya, even I’ll come. Tell her Surya that we can’t take her till vizag. Tell him that I’ll take care of that surya. Please tell her to understand man. He will tell like that only. I’ll book tickets for you too. Yaayy okay. To which place are you going first? Arakku valley, Bora caves, and museum. These are the must see places. Oooh.. Okay Hey look at this. What is there in this? Look at the first letter of this coin. Looks similiar to the one in our clue. Yeah dude. These are greek letters. Look at this.. these letters.. Hey these are Roman letters. How are you these are roman? This is neither capital nor lower case letters. Roman letters. Arrey yaar.. What? Hey hey hey you guys were with me only right. When did you visit Greek and Roman. These are the tamil letters which were used during our ancient Tamil ruler Cheran. Oh this is tamil eh? This is Chinese or Arabic. This is our Tamil letter. Ancient Tamil. This is tamil man.. Thats what he told na. Hmm okay. In our clue this is our first letter. There are three more letters na? mmm.. haan. We have our Google Pichai. Look look. Tell me Aa, uu, AA, AA..AA..that all Aa, uu, AA.... Give that. Hmm.. Does Om denote Lord Murugan? Why? It can be like this too right.. Om Ganapathy namaha. Then aa means? It can mean aalamaram. Hmm.. maybe. Can you think anything the letters which are below? But, there is a circle surrounding all the hints. Have they put this simply or do they have any meaning? Leave. We are gonna go there na, we will get some clue. Where are we going first? Hey we are going to the museum first, then Bora caves from there and then arakku. Akhil, sneha has sent a message. She’s there in the museum it seems. Where are we going next? Arakku valley.. What are we going to do there? Now only we started right. Are you tired so fast? No man. what are we going to ask there? And To whom? First we will go and look there. Okay. Can we order a tea? For me milk. I have a doubt. What? Why has your grandpa giving such hard clues? He could have just mentioned the name of the place. That’s what he told us right. Not to go in search of that treasure. Thanks. Here milk for you. aa.. uu... don’t know what it exactly means. aa.. it can be cow too na? There is aavin milk shop in our place right? Then we have to look which place gives importance to cows. Lets us ask someone, you have tea What are you doing Google. Bora caves. There only Lord Shiva and cow is there on Shiva’s head. Does that circle signify the caves then? mm correct Then that aa..uu..AA.. That’s what we have found out na.. Lets go and see there. Let’s start. Okay do one thing. Call sneha and tell her to go to room. We will go to Bora caves and go to room. Sudharsan, did you come to know anything about the cow? Huh.. How to look.. There was this priest inside, ushering us to move. Wasn’t able to see anything. I was not able to look at Shivan itself in the darkness. Where to look for that cow! Below the lingam, i was able to see some three letters. Don’t know what that means. If we are able to find that out, we will get some clue. Hmm.. How do we see that clearly? They had decorated it with fruits and flowers. I have a hunch that there might be something inside this cave. Yeah. In that hint too they had written inside the circle na?. Hmm.. one minute. This cave was there in the 18th century. But only for the past 2 years there is this 21 face Rudhraksha chain in Shivan’s neck. The technology of relating words and its numbers. Hmmm Those letters inside the circles are not some words, those are all numbers. I think there is something in that Rudhraksha chain. Tamil is so ancient right. It’s been there for the past 2500 years specially crafted with numbers and phoenics without the intermixing of any languages. If Tamil had been those Britisher’s mother tongue, they would have made the whole world pray this language. We are uselessly roaming without knowing the worth of our language. Hmm.. Atleast we know to write and read Tamil, but the present generation are running away from Tamil. If this goes on like this, after 100 years we will be reading in English about ancient Tamil. We ourselves don’t know about the ancient tamil Hmm mmm yeah. As if you will be knowing. I found out. Aahh means 8, U means 2, A means 7. 8..2..7.. So The Rudhraksha which we need to take is 8, 2, 7. We can stay here tonight, collect information about all the things we need and leave in the morning along with the crowd. Ok, i’ll do one thing. I’ll go inside, design a plan and come. Akhil? What happened? I planned perfectly. Lets go to room and discuss. Not here. Ok come lets go. In the Keezhadi village of Shivagangai district, college professors and students are showing interest to take a look at the archeological remains which were discovered during the excavation in that village. In the district of vishakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh, the 21 faced Rudhraksha chain has been stolen from the Bora caves. Due to the sudden disappearance of the Rudhraksha which unexpectedly appeared in the neck of Lord Shiva before 2 years, there has been a hustle in that area. The policemen have filed a case on this and have been enquiring. News will be continued after a break. Hey Surya did you see the news? The rudhraksha has been stolen from the Bora caves it seems. Is it? Check if this the same one. Hey.... What? Heyyy what have you done man! That’s what they are saying in Tv right. Look there. Don’t talk without knowing its seriousness. You have stolen it. OMG! If I have taken it without anyone’s knowledge, is it called Theft? What else is it then? Hey that’s why we came here right. Then what. Check it fast. Sneha give. 21 faced Rudhraksha is there. But how to find the 8, 2 and 7th face? Arrey archeologist. Check it. Sneha, here look. Cut carefully. These are the 8th, 2nd and 7th faces. But, it doesn’t look like Rudhraksha. Looks like some breakable content. Give. Can we cut and check? Hmm.. We can try. It’s a memory card in a piece of paper. Surya, take that laptop. What is written? The rays of the rising glory. Look at this. I don’t understand anything. Hey Akhil, it’s asking for password yaar. That too we have only 3 chances. If all the three goes wrong it will be blocked. Password huh? Hmm... What if the password might be the hint in the paper? Read what is written. The rays of the rising glory. In here its written “Blossoming of the maiden’s heart” The two lined quotes says it all. The rays of the rising glory– maybe they denote the sun Then what does Blossoming of the maiden’s heart mean? Sun(another name), sun Akhil: denotes place Sneha: are they mentioning east west? Sun, beach, which side sun rises? Maybe Kanyakumari? so it could be kanyakumari? hmmm... kanyakumari... Surya, enter that. It’s wrong. You left that 3rd paper. The two lined quotes says it all. Hmm.. kanyakumari.. what all are famous in kanyakumari? Beach.. Amman temple. Vivekanandar statue. Thiruvalluvar statue? Huh? Thiruvalluvar. A sentence clipped to two... The one who ruled the world in 2 sentences. Thiruvalluvar. Why can’t it be? Hey Thiruvalluvar is the password. Check it. Hey only 2 chances are there. Arey put that yaar. Only one more chance. If that is also wrong then we have to return to chennai. One minute. Kanyakumari’s spelling can be written in many ways. Few write kann, and few write kan. The same goes with thiruvalluvar. Few may put double L and few single L. Words may change but numbers will never. So if these many things are right, why can’t the total number of thirukkural be the password? Hmm Okay.. You all stared at me when it was wrong the last time. Now we 4 are here right, let us all contribute. Hmm 1... Here you type 3.. Hm.. Here you too type 3.. We still have time.. This is the last chance. Yaaayyy... It has opened. I know that before itself.yes...yes Akhil, I’m so happy that you have come so far just for me. Please destroy all the secrets regarding this treasure. Finally I’m searching for a subway. There are many dangers around me. I don’t even know if I’ll be alive when you see this video. Akhil open that zip file. What is there in that? There are 6 files. Open them one by one. Is this the burnt paper? Hmm.. Oooh.. Then is this the paper which was stolen by your grandpa from the yaazh library? Was he in prison for this? Sorry man. What man... Sorry dude. I called your grandpa a thief in a flow. It hurts.. but that’s the truth right. Hmm okay. What case was that? Why did he go to prison? He will tell. In the yazhpanam library there were many historic records about Tamilians which would make the world agape in awe. There were many records about rare form of arts and secrets. In 1981, my granpda who worked in archeology department, went to that library at night without any ones knowledge to collect few information. At that time few people set fire to that place and ran away. My grandpa luckily came back alive. He was able to save few scrolls. Without giving it to the government, he kept it to himself. For that he was charged. What happened at last? Half of the library was burnt. But no one knows what my grandpa took from there. As there wasn’t enough evidence, he was released. There is nothing wrong on your grandpa’s part. It would have burnt even if he hadn’t taken those. Let’s see the first file. In the year 2017, on 22nd of the tamil month chiththirai, according to the orders of zhagaram, the day when the Swan’s placed had changed. With the entry to a new place, the old one changes, Tamilnadu. What does that zhagaram word mentioned there mean? Even I don’t understand it Surya, Swan might be the code which the organisation had kept for the treasure. okay. Look at the next one. Its some stone sculpture. Sculpture eh? See, if you can find anything? Its a very old sculpture. There are 6 people in the stance of praying with folded hands. It looks like those ancient cavemen. When we look at these stone structure I can definitely say they are Indian style. But since it is too old.. hmmm... You can find similiar structures in Ankerward temple. But if we need more details about this we need to look for some senior archeologists. But they are only 4 to 5. Oye. You have studied the same subject right? Don’t you know? What are they going to do even if I know? They will bury it like how it happened in Keezhadi. Give. It shows some dots and dotted lines. Can’t understand anything. How many files are there more? 3 files. Check the next one. Everything is in Arabic. What is this man! Everything is getting more complicated as we go deeper. One of my friends is in Dubai. Can we send this to him and ask for help? No. Let’s first see if we are able to solve anything. If we can’t we can ask him. Okay. Look for the next. It looks like some old destroyed painting. He will look at this and speak as if he knows this one too. Heyyy I’ve seen this somewhere. But I don’t remember where. Hmm mmm as if you have solved all the clues. Go go.. Look at the next one. haha.. What happened. Only this thing is in Tamil What is written in it? (Lines from the Tamil Epic Manimekalai by Seethalai Saathanar) This is from the epic Manimekalai written by Seethalai Saathanaar. Do you know about that? Google it. (tamil lines) this means, the one who gives food to those who are able to earn it are businessmen. Haan.. See it’s like this. Our Suds always gives treat to rich guys right. We shouldn’t do like this. Oye! Just Fun Yaa Look what’s next. The true dharma lies in offering food to those who are in need of it. When one does like that, it equals to offering your own life. That is the meaning of “undi koduthor uyir koduthore” All are fine. But what is the relation between this and the treasure? No idea. We have to find that. We don’t know anything from these 6 clues. We started knowing nothing. But now we have come so far. It’s a big success for us. Now, where are we going next? Chennai. Hmm Akhil is faster than we thought. Come akhil come The history is awaiting for your arrival and the treasure awaits your touch Far beyond the destiny The once fresh happy lands Destroyed by selfish hunger Come to teach the foolish people a lesson Escaped from the sun's heat hide from the eyes of wind come to witness the scene beyond the hands The blood stained warlands That survived natural disasters awaits your footprints Come to rescue your treasure tamil poet lines To end the sufferings of ZHAGARAM Come oh hero, come oh Akhil Wow... The feel of Chennai.. I need to eat briyani first. Because of people like you only there is food scarcity in the nation. Hey I didn’t say this man. Central minister told. Oh.. is it? Dad is calling me. I came here with the excuse of office tour. Hello Sir Hello Sneha.You’ve given me all the info I asked for. You can now leave. Sir... That.. I told you to leave. Hmm sure sir. Hey...Spoke with dad? Yeah. He’s asking me come there tomorrow. Hey it’s him calling. Hi Akhil, are your searching for the treasure or not? Yes we are. I asked only you three to search for that. Looks like you are roaming with some girl. Who’s that? Is it Sneha? Send her off. Don’t waste much time. Find the treasure soon. I’ll meet you in person. he’s saying about Sneha now. It’s not very simple. He’s really spying on us. Yes. Okay so how are we going solve the clues now? We need a really talented archeologist. Oyeee. Chill. You are leaving right. That’s why I said like that. Hmmm ok ok.. We’ll do like this Let’s show all the clues to someone we know and ask them about it. We might get some clue. And yeah one of my uncle is there in Tirupur. He’s not an archeologist but he has lots of collection of antique materials Can we ask him? Yeah If so, I know one cab. I’ll make the arrangements for you. Hmm okay. So we will leave now and make the packings for tirupur. Come let’s go. Hello. Hey where’s the cab. He’s near only. Wait. Haan he’s coming. I saw him. His one ear is deaf. Careful ok? Like Nayanthara in Naanum Rowdy Thaan eh? Okay Okay I saw him He wouldn’t be able to hear if we speak anything about the treasure na! It’s good only. Guys the cab is here. Travel safe. Sir can we leave? Om Namashivaaya. Kantha Kadamba Kathirvela Karthikeya (Hindu God’s names). Make us all reach safely. Vigneshwara vinayaka pillaiyaaare Moothone (Hindu God’s names) us all reach safely. Alleluya Jesus be with us. Allahuakba Hey it’s getting late. Hey he can’t hear too.. Thank God he finished. Why is it not starting? Hmm.. Bro it’s not starting. Again I’ll say it 108 times. What! 108 times! (chanting mantras again) Hey.. If it goes like this then we will reach tomorrow only hey from where u got him? I’ll walk to tirupur! Hey wait man. Stay calm or else he will say it again 108 times. Let me think of some idea. Hey the vehicle started. God’s blessing for you. All of you pray to God. It’s good for you too. Shall we start? Is he your uncle? Yeah Welcome Surya. How are you? How’s everyone home? Yeah all are fine. Welcome welcome. And why I came here is, Akhil too is like you only So much love for Tamil. He’s doing research on antique sculptures and paintings. Oh ok ok. What should I do for you? Sir like Surya said if you can give me the details about the historic scrolls paintings it’d be useful for my research. What am I going to do with all those? All are lying uselessly. Sit, I’ll bring them. Hey. What are guys doing without concentrating on the important work. If we ask him immediately about those he will be skeptical. Come let’s go and sit. Have a look which all will be useful for you. I don’t remember what all are there It has been locked inside that room for the past 10 to 15 years Look which you will be needing. Why are you getting hiccups? Wait I’ll bring water. Here drink some water. Sir what is this one? This is Dhrovpathi and Pandavas. This rock is located in Karnataka in a place called Ambatheertha. Oh. Sir do you know anything else about this? I don’t know much about this But our ancestors have done many rock paintings like this. If we hadn’t known these we would not have known about their existence and their lifestyle. What are trying to say? Are you saying that Mahabharat, Ramayana all are true? The places which were said to be drowned under the seas in history like Dwaraka was found in Gurajat, under the waters. There are many researches going on related to that. What I’m thinking is, for the great mahabharat war, the writer has used his tactics and with the help of magic like the saree which came out never ending and like flying from one place to another, he has weaved an interesting tale to read. I dont think like that. It might be true or our poets could have added some fantasy too while writing. Something about this please? A saint and a Lotus. Surya, in net search for Sithanavasal painting. Haan this is the one. This is the Sithanavasal painting near Pudukottai. I told you right. Okay sir. Thank you so much. We are leaving now. You have come this far. You cannot leave without eating something Yeah let’s eat and leave. Why so much hurry? Uncle will be hurt na? It’s our road, our place but see how many tolls are there and how much they charge When looking at all these it’s really frustrating. If a person eats with salt in his food and is daring enough he shouldn’t pay u paid just now Your money right? You should have asked na? You should have asked them na? I asked once... They slapped me hard. From that day onwards I’m not able to hear properly. Now only we are getting to know the reason why he is deaf one side dude. Nothing nothing. Akhil, why are you looking at that still? Did you notice what’s happening here? Where are we going next? Karnataka or Pudukottai? Nowhere. We are going to Chennai. Before grandpa passed away, he said he needs to find the secret passage. Now are next work is to find where that passage will be. It can be in karnataka or pudukottai right? I don’t think so. Hey look at this. It looks like there is difference between these two pictures na? Look at this place. Yeah. There is something. Look at this print. There is Lotus. Yeah. But look at this. Wow. What a minute difference. They have drawn something and hidden it in the place of that lotus flower But what does this vessel mean? I have studied it inch by inch but not able to decode anything Even after knowing that 2 and 6 clue, we are not able to find the treasure. We need to know what those Arabic letters are. Can I whatsapp this image to my friend? Dont send him the whole thing. Send him only half of it. How do I know which is full and which is half? Usually Arabic letters will be written from right to left. So send him only the right side portions. Haan. Okay. Can we go for a small break and come? Okay. I’ve stopped the vehicle Everything is fine. I’ll keep updating you. Forgetting that I’m deaf I answer their questions sometimes Even then these foolish guys are not able to find it out. Surya is talking too much He’s going to get nice beatings from me. Looks like they are coming. I’ll call you later. Hello Sudharsan. Project Huk No one has doubted you na? Everything is going as per plan I’ll bring you the treasure even if it involves killing these two. Good. Always keep your phone on. Sure. Just look into the money I asked. Hey have you informed Sneha? Yup done. Hello.. Accident huh? What happened yaar? My dad met with an accident. Don’t worry. He will be fine. Let’s leave immediately. Mom. It’s nothing. Everything will be alright Let’s leave. Surya, I guess this is the work of that gang. Why don’t we file a complaint to the police? We were worried for thier lives right? Look what happened now! It’s an accident again. They have tried to kill my dad. I don’t think those people would have done this. How are saying this so surely? Simple logic man. What they need is the treasure and we are looking for it. If they did this accident, then the search will be delayed. So, the lose is for them. Not for us. They might have done this to fasten us up na? Hey! Look! I don’t know the reason behind this. But if anything happens to my dad I won’t spare their lives. Akhil is again making us do something. Akhil, what are we going to do now? You both leave to your native. Then that treasure? If I go in search of that treasure, even after these many incidents, there won’t be a great fool like me. Then you... Don’t talk anything. Let me see what he does. Huh huh.. Hello.. Sudharsan, I’ve given you so much money than which you are capable of earning. There’s a trouble here. I know what to do. Just listen to me. Surya.. Hmm... Give me the Swan and get back Sneha. What are we going to do now. Hey why are silent man? No idea. How did Sneha fall in their trap? I told you right? Didn’t I? I told you they will go to any extent right! Now look.. He knows everything which we do. That’s what even I’m asking. How? We don’t have time to think about that. Your unwanted decision has now cost the life of Sneha. Let us just give the treasure to them and bring Sneha back. We have no other option. Yeeah man. Sudharsan is right. Oneday he will fall in our trap. Let’s now start from where we left. Hello Did you get the message akhil? Do you want Sneha or not? I told you earlier right. You can't escape without finding that treaure for me. Look, if anything happens to Sneha... Stop saying these Cinema dialogues I’ve seen many like this Do what I say and then you and your friends will be fine. Don’t try such heroic acts. I’m watching your every move. Be careful. You had messaged your Dubai friend na, did you receive any reply? Yeah.. Akhil, that is Arabic only. They are saying that as Syed-Al-Buhari. What does it mean? It’s a book written by the disciples of Nabigal Nayagam for him. Ohh... Akhil, take that hint. Here. There are 3 numbers and 3 words. Don’t know what that is. We have to find that. I have asked that too.. It’s the chapter and volume in that book. If that book is with us, we can find it easily. Hey there is google search na. Let me check there. Look.. There was a person called Jabbir. He went to Nabigal and said “My dad had got money from many people and now he is no more. We are only left with the dates and nothing else. Even if it takes several years we wont be able to pay off the debt. The lenders will behave were badly. I’m so scared. Can you accompany me too?” Nabigal went with him and gave the blessings of Allah on the heap of dates And when they check the weight of it after that, there was another heap of dates with the same quantity left for them after paying off the debts. What is there in this? He has done many wonders like this. Did you notice something? All the clues are related to food. Yeah. Manimekalai, Sithanavasal painting, the begging bowl and now this. But, in the hint 2, there was pandavas na? There was anything related to food in that. Correct Hey Surya look at this. There is a vessel in the 2nd clue too. We hadn’t noticed it. Is it? But what is relation between Pandavas, Dhrowpathi and this vessel? I can’t decipher anything. I’ll tell you what I know. Just see if anything is useful for you. Dhrowpathi and the five Pandavas went into the forest right? Many saints and travellers had come to visit them. We need to offer food to those who visit us right? How will they get food in the forest? Dharma felt so embarrased. So at that time, a saint called Dhomaiyar, told them to pray the Sun Lord. When Dharma prayed, the Sun Lord felt so elated and gave him a Akshayapaatiram And dhrowpathi offered them food with that. Akshay means imperishable. The food content in that will not reduce even after serving. That’s alright man. But what s the relation between that and the treasure? I too don’t understand that. What all clues are pending? The 3rd one. No idea what it is. Oh the lines and dots. Can we ask for someone’s help? To whom will you ask and what? Where all to search for you? Akhil why are standing outside in this cool weather? Didn’t you come to eat? Why did you come up at this time dad? Go and take rest dad. I’m fine yaar. Come and eat. You go dad. We will come. Okay. Come soon. Hmm.. This is thanthi coding right? What? Thanthi? This generation wouldn;t know all these things. I used this when i was working in the postal department. You guys have this facebook, whatsapp and all na. Okay, mom is calling you all to have food. First have your food. How do we find what these symbols are? The whole world is inside my hands man! Every english alphabet and number has a coding. Here.. This is a hint about Bible. Previously it was Nabigal Nayagam, related to Quran. Now it is Bible. You see there also they would have mentioned Jesus did something with food. How are you saying. Search it in google. Hey Akhil, you are right man. Wait I’ll read. Once upon a time when people came to meet Jesus, he realized they were hungry. So he asked his disciples to bring some food. They brought 5 appam and 2 fishes. Jesus blessed it and gave back to his disciples they served it to the people Even after everyone had their stomachs full, they took 12 baskets full of food. In total 5000 people would have eaten. Hey this isn’t any new story. It’s all the same old one. Okay. Answer me something. 2nd clue was the five pandavas. Yeah Mahabharat. When did it take place? B.C 950? Next clue Jesus. That one? B.C.46 Manimekalai? That one AD 1st century. Next is nabigal nayagam. When did it happen? AD 6th century. Sithanavasal painting is AD 7th century. It’s there in my uncle’s book. Remember? OMG! What I thought is right. What did you think? What is right? Look here.. From the 2nd to the 6th clue BC 950, BC 5, AD 1, AD 600, AD 700. Everything has happened in the next years. So what? There some historic relation between that treasure and these events. I don’t understand. I’ll explain you. What was there in the 1st clue? The burnt paper. In that they had mentioned is as the Annaparavai (Swan) right? Yeah. What does annam mean? It means food. Yes. Here annam denotes food. Then what does the Paravai mean? We can say it flew from one century to the other or we can say it flew from one person to the other. What flew? The treasure. Don’t you understand even now? The treasure is nothing but the vessel which Dhrowpathi had, with which Jesus did wonders, with whichManimekalai gave feast and nabigal nayagam did wonders. the vessel, the “AkshayaPaatiram” So the treasure which we are searching for is the Akshaya Paatiram huh? And not gold, diamond or anything else? Definitely no. My grandpa had mentioned in that letter that it cannot be bought with any amount of money. Gold and diamond are not even a tad bit equal to this. You don’t understand. Do you? Do you know what all can be done with the help of that bowl? You can completely eradicate poverty. There won’t be any deaths due to starvation. You can turn this world green. A world without starvation where everyone can get food to eat. How wonderful would it be. In the olden days they used to sing, if there isn’t food for a single man we would destroy the whole world” But not it’s like they will destroy the world for a single man’s food. Man has started killing plants, trees, animals and everything for his selfishness If this bowl comes out, definitely they would spare that. Everyone will fight among their states to get hold of this Then between nations. That’s why my grandpa had mentioned destruction is for sure if it comes out. I’ve a doubt. There is evidence for this bowl being with Dhrowpathi and Manimekalai. But there is no proof of it being with Jesus and Nabigal. Don’t know. But they have stated in every religion that there has been many wonders done in food. But, none has explained how that food came. That’s why they had kept that bowl with a different name. All these are my grandpa’s clues. Can’t say these are 100% right. Who possessed that bowl is not important for us. How are we going to find that? That’s important. Without knowing anything how to find it? I don’t get it too. We are missing some clue. How did you find that it is in Kanchipuram? All the files in the memory card has a tamil word at the end. This is known as the Anagram i.e a word formed by rearranging the letters of another After rearranging those letters I got this word Kanchipuram. Okay. Where is that tunnel in Kanchipuram? Thiruvadanthai. The pallava king has constructed a subway from Mahabalipuram to NithyaPerumal temple in Thiruvadanthai. They say it still exists. Bro i’ll bring the jerkin. Why are they visiting ancient temples? They are simply walking away after that. If I shut and go I’ll get caught. Without looking at the Gods in temple why are they looking at the walls? So is this that subway? Why are we waiting. Come let’s break in. We are in public. Can’t break in. Have to search for some other way. He’s right. All the secret pathways will be 10feet from the ground level. Let’s walk for a kilometer and check. There wont be any people in that place. Let’s dig in a 10 feet pit and let’s move in. What do you guys say? Lets go. They are roaming around forests, mountains and all the hilly areas They have planned to do something here. Wait. We both will go inside because we need your help when we come up What is this man. The pit is so deep. It’s ok. Let’s jump Sudharsa, put some insurance for me. What is this. They are jumping in one by one! But he’s standing alone outside. Akhil.. Where are you? Here only. Where are you. Switch on the torch. Will they come back? Will I get my taxi money? Hello. I’m not able to go in. How will i follow them? Don’t go. I’ll tell you when the time comes. Wait till then. Come lets take a look. Hey it’s our Gothandam. How did he come here? May be he came by air We can spare our taxi fare then. Come let’s go. I thought they would come running to help me But they are walking away at the same pace Hey guys wait let me come. Woahh.. Beautiful paintings. Hey akhi we are not sure of those clues are there in here. Why do we need to strain ourselves? I have a hunch. It’s in here. Come let’s go. Hey Akhil, the swan man! It’s the swan only na. Not the anaconda right. The dried up sands in the Arms Warehouse. The tree between these two. Surya the first clue that we got is this swan right? But what’s the realtion between these two? That bowl.. It was in the sithanavasal painting right? That is the Akshaya Paatiram. But the tomb above that and the Nandhi statue. I don’t understand anything. Can I say? What? It’s the Tanjore Temple. How are you saying? Once I went for a pick up there. That guy got down and told me to look at the temple tomb carefully. I was looking at that and he ran away. Even we are going to do that. Hey Akhil, where are we going next? Tanjore Where in Tanjore? First to temple. There are many things in that temple. What? The height of the tomb is 216ft. In Tamil the consonantal vowels is 216. Lord Siva’s statue height is 18ft. In Tamil, the consonants count is 18. And the distance between Lord Shiva and Nandhi is 244. In tamil,if we add the arithmetic character, the total word count is 244 Raja raja cholan loves Tamil a lot. So he kept the base of tamil and built that temple. Okay.. Is there anything that relates our treasure and this temple? Don’t know Surya. But in this painting ‘The dried up sands in the Arms Warehouse.The tree between these two’ You do onething. Search for any ancient arms warehouse in Tanjore. I checked. It’s Azhamparai in Tanjore. It was built for the army of the Raja Raja Cholan during his period. This is the Army Warehouse during Raja Raja Cholan’s period. What should we search here? No idea. But here below this painting they have mentioned “It resides where the bricks and the trees meet” Mankatti means bricks only right? Hmm.. yeah.. we need find the place where the tree and the briks meet around this castle The place is so vast. I’ll go this way. You guys go that way. Let’s see what we can find. Hey how did you come here? Hey i came to pee man. Oye this is that ancient tree. Yeah there’s the brick stones near it too. So where should we dig? Dig till you find something Hey what is that? Take it carefully. Look at it. It looks like some poem written in the palm leaf bundle. Yeah it is a poem. All these are poems man. (tamil poetic lines) According to this poem, the next place we need to visit is Kovalam. Oh. Is it? What else is mentioned? (tamil poetic lines) Akhil, we have found out. Akhil, Next we need to go to Kovalam. Come let’s go. Hey... Why don’t you look happy.. Yeah.. Right.. It’s ok. Come let’s leave. Wait. Why are you so curious? It’s because of the girl yaar.. Sneha.. They are torturing us na? Come let’s leave. Then who’s this? Sneha how come you are here? Please pardon me Akhil. It was Sudharsan who asked to act me like this. Hey.. How come you are here? No one kidnapped me. Hello Hello Sneha.. It’s Sudharsan. Tell me Sudharsan.. How’s everything going on? Yeah all good. Can you check your account please? Account huh? Wait.. Yeah.. 1 lakhs rupees has been transferred to my account. How? This is just the beginning. Even I didn’t understand it at the start. If we help them in this plan we will get 10 crore rupees. Akhil denied to go in search of the treasure stating some sentimental issues. Just because of money your marriage was cancelled If you help in this plan, we can change Akhil’s status. What do you say? What should I do now? You have backstabbed me man! Traitor! Akhil, they threatened me. I didn’t know what else to do. Hey what’s happening here? Ask him. What did you do yaar? Come on speak. I thought you were my dearest friend. Why did you do like this? Tell me. Leave him dude. Stop it. It is right when you search for the treasure for your selfishness. Sudharsan has been caught red handed. Did we do all these for money? No. But did you do it to save your lives? There is selfishness in this too right? You have the wish to find the treasure right? Is that not the love for money? It’s right when you do, and wrong when I do. Is it? Understand. I didn’t want anything to happen, that’s why i gave him little information. That’s all. Oh is it? That’s all huh? Then what is this? Akhil.. Look even your friend becomes a traitor when it comes to money. Let’s see who wins man. I’m going alone to destroy the next clue. Stop me if you can. Hey come.. Get lost man. Akhil has gone out of our way. We need to call our big brother. Akhil what are we going to do next? They shouldn’t get the treasure. We need to something immediately for that. No need for that. Sir, you? Yeah I belong to zhagaram. I know they will follow you after your grandfather. That’s why I warned you in the office. You didn’t pay heed to it. That was when I met Sneha. I know you will come in search of the treasure. So we decided to get hold of him with your help. But now there’s no need for that. Why? He should be alive for that. Hello.. Brother, Akhil has found out the truth. What should we do now? You have shattered all my plans. Can’t you do a single work properly. You take your salary and leave. Is that all? We need a fight scene in the movie na? Every movie has a fight scene sir. So if it goes like this, our movie will be different sir. What bro. How can a movie be without a fight scene? We definitely need a fight in our movie. The audience will expect it dude. Commercial movie.. Since the time of MGR the custom has been songs, dance, and fight They are asking for it. Our movie has everything except fight. Let’s keep a fight scene. We have to. Ok sir. Let’s keep a fight scene like your wish. At the climax, as usual hero and villian gets into a fight sir. Villian as usual shoots him with a thousand bullets but not even a single bullet hits the hero. But our hero, shoots with only one bullet. It hits him in the forehead and he’s dead on the spot. Finally our hero saves as per the justice. How is he? Is he narrating an interesting story? When can we arrange the functions for the movie sir? Let’s do it in the coming week. I’m glad brother. Ok thank you sir. What is this yaar. He’s asking us to end with the usual climax? Hmmm the blue shirt which he wore is the reason for everything. Blue shirt huh? Yeah.. People will tend to think all weird things if they wear blue shirt. Okay tell me the climax. I myself will go and get that Akshayapaatiram. The one who was behind us is dead Now should we be scared for the murderer? Zhagaram will take care of everything. Sir what is this zhagaram organisation? Who are they? Who created those clues? Zhagaram is a huge network. Many people are involved in this. Why should the treasure be kept in hiding? Everything here is a secret. Because, if they get to know about this, they will fight among themselves first to possess it. Then it will be among the nations This earth wouldn’t bear another World War. If the treasure comes out, destruction is for sure But now, we are in a stage to keep that safe. In the coming 30 to 40 years the world will face a huge poverty Without rains, without water, without food, everyone will struggle. A situation will come when humans will start killing each other to feed on them. To save all this, the only solution is Akshayapaatiram. Whatever, our work is over right? We won’t be in trouble anymore right? Over huh? Haha.. The game just begins. Akhil, the path which you crossed so far wasn’t just a coincidence Since the time you were born, there was a shadow which had followed you. That is zhagaram. What is the relation between you and this treasure? Why these many people are protecting you? And many are wishing to kill you? What is the relation between you and the five Pandavas? Or what is the realtion between you and Raja Raja Cholan? Who are you? If you need the answers for all these questions, you must go to the place where this Akshayapaatiram is hid. Where? Kumari Kandam. The moment the first human was born on this earth, the Tamil language and the Tamil culture was born. The place where the first human is believed to be born, is Kumarigandam, the place which was under the rule of Pandavas. land of rich prolific mountains and rivers and that had 41 countires together Kumarigandam is now submerged under the oceans? Our Kumari land was once widespread which includes the different nations like India, Sri Lanka, Australia and Africa. For the past 9990 years, the place where the 3 Tamil organizations originated, the place where many famous literary works like Thirukkural, Tholkaappiyam originated is Kumarigandam. The refereances about this land has been there in many literary works Silapathigaram, Iraiyanar agaporul, Kanthapuraanam and Thiruvilaiyaadal Puranam. The things that we haven’t heard so far, haven’t seen so far the things which are beyond our imagination like sculptures, mahals, temples, buildings wonders are hidden there in that land Above all, the Aksayapaatiram which has been protected since centuries, is now awaiting our arrival. Come let’s visit the submerged lands under the oceans learn about the lives of our ancestors and recover many treasures. That’s the place where the Sun and the moon meets at the same plane. Give that Surya. (tamil poetic lyrics) Oh, so in the second part you are going to the Kumarigandam in search of the treasure. The entrance to the kumarigandam is where the oceans will split open. Movie is awesome man. Definitely it will be a hit. Whatever man. I was able to do only this much with 10lakhs.
