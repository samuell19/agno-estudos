TUFFI FILMS PRESENTS DIRECTED BY WRITTEN BY CINEMATOGRAPHY COSTUME DESIGNER ART DIRECTORS MAKEUP DESIGNERS EDITORS SOUND DESIGNER COMPOSER PRODUCER Why did he take his pants off at 8 p.m.? I'm tired of seeing his dick every night. We started drinking at 2 p.m., - so it's natural he had taken them off by 8. So he does the same thing every time? - Yeah. Hi. Where are you headed? Sorry. What? - "What?" I was wondering if we're headed in the same direction. Are we in such luck? It looks like we are. - Yes! This is how champions are made. Anyway, we're going to a party at this house. I bet you've never seen a house like this. I haven't, either. It's a friend's house. There are three saunas: a steam room, infrared sauna - and a Turkish sauna if you want something more exotic. There's a hot tub outside. There's a Jacuzzi inside, if you like bubbles on your skin. The sound system will make you vibrate inside. It feels weird but nice. The most important thing is that there's free booze. And there are nice people. There are other nice girls. But they might not be exactly as nice as you are, - or at least not as hot as you are. I'm sure you'll have a fun day. FORCE OF HABIT It's about us bringing onstage what's between the words - and creating a story for all of us. What we bring onstage becomes the collective unconscious. I'm sorry I'm late. I didn't know we're rehearsing here. - No problem. We'll start with George and Cathrine's scene - from the first act. I made some omissions last night, - but it might still be a bit outdated. We'll rehearse the end after lunch. We need to figure out what to do with the blood - so that it doesn't look totally fake. So let's just have a table read. Please start. What's your name again? - Päivi. Read the parentheticals. - "Third act, scene 10. Night." "A divan and an untouched dinner on tray onstage." "Cathrine walks around restlessly, looking for something." "Sally, the old and trusty maid, looks worried." Madam, you should rest. You shouldn't exert yourself in your condition. You haven't even touched your dinner. Where's my bottle of valerian? I feel devastated. My husband has been acting strange tonight. Madam, you looked radiant at the ball tonight. Like a royal rose in the Buckingham Palace Garden. At least I got you to fuck before unpacking. Yay me! Two of my favorite things. Here. - Thanks. You can unpack mine if you get such a kick out of it. I have to say your Airbnb hunt paid off. I love this apartment. I'm happy some of my obsessions bring us joy. Have a wonderful vacay, hon. The party continues at the karaoke bar! The cops are here. I'll call us a taxi. I'm not coming. - The party continues at the karaoke bar! Come with us! - I have an early morning. We'll sing "Are There Still Wild Horses?" Ew, fuck. Are you coming? - Definitely not. Let's go. Hey, Emmi. Emmi... Get out. Move it. Emmi. I'll buy you a drink. One with glitter or unicorn piss. It sounds lovely, but I have work tomorrow morning. C'mon, let's go. - No. Bye. I think it's over there. - Let's go check it out. "After the marquis's death, the palace was occupied - by a Dutch diamond merchant named Daniel Gildemeester." I'd go crazy if I had to live in a palace. - Why? It would be too much. Too beautiful. Too sublime. And you could never have a messy home. I actually could because it would be my palace. Some mess adds coziness to a home. What happened? That man grabbed my ass. What? Seriously? - Yeah, for real. That's unbelievable. You're not even alone here. Maybe it was an accident. - No, it wasn't. He grabbed me like this. That must be his wife and daughter, - and they didn't say anything. That's him. They're pretending they didn't hear you. Fucking gross. Unbelievable. I'm really sorry. About what? - About this whole thing. Are you somehow embarrassed? - What do you mean? Are you embarrassed that he groped me? Of course not. I'm just angry. Are you sure you want to stay? - Of course I want to. George. - "George doesn't answer. He stares at his wife." What's the matter? - "George doesn't answer." What are you going to do? - "George caresses Cathrine passionately." Who are you? - Your wife Cathrine. Your faithful wife. - Swear. Swear that you're faithful. "George tries to kiss Cathrine." - George, stop. "Overcome by lust, George grabs Cathrine's petticoat." "Cathrine fights back, but she's too weak." "George's face is distorted." Your scent. Your sweet and cunning scent. I trusted you, you deceitful whore. You bewitched me. Are you saying you're not a whore? They're gossiping all the way in Cambridge - about how the Duke of Sussex couldn't take his eyes off you. Your deceitfulness has made him crazy. You're not saying no to me tonight. "George rapes Cathrine." You're a whore. That stench will never leave you. "Scared, Cathrine curls up. She doesn't understand - what's going on. George cries inconsolably." What have I done? "Cathrine consoles George." "George can't bring himself to look into Cathrine's gentle eyes." "George strikes Cathrine. She falls onto the divan, sobbing." "The gramophone stops." - Intermission. What confuses me is... Should we bring Cumbridge and Duke of Suck Sex onstage? I mean, we could. It's Sussex. Cambridge and Sussex. All right. Let's delete that joke. Do you have comments or observations? I omitted some of your scenes. - All of them. Yes, in a way. I moved the scenes before the ball downstairs. I think it's good - that George can't bring himself to look at Cathrine. Yes, I think so too. Oh my God! Fuck! You scared me. - I didn't mean to. What is it? Hey. Can I lie down here a moment? I don't feel good. Lie down on the floor then. Let's get some sleep. Emmi. Can we talk? About what? Like, about what you think about things. What I think about things? - Don't laugh. I mean, we don't know each other that well. But I always thought you were really smart. Like, when you gave a presentation about Boudoir. It was really interesting. Beauvoir. It's Simone de Beauvoir. Boh-voo-are. - That's what I said. Boudoir. So you really want me to tell you - about Simone de Beauvoir now? Why not. I'll tell you another time. So there will be another time? What do you mean? Are we going to see each other again? Maybe. - Only "maybe"? A strong "maybe." Okay. Can I get into bed with you? We'd just lie next to each other. It's nice and warm here. All right, but now we need to get some sleep. You... You deceitful whore. Can you do it in this position? - Shit. Wait. If I do this... - Wait, my leg is here. Thanks. Stop. Stop. The thing is that it should be real to you. George, you're acting at the moment. The only thing you need to do is leave your comfort zone. Tolerate your incompleteness. Your incompleteness and insecurity are George's insecurity. Use it to your advantage. - What about... People love incompleteness and shame - and the way he is both good and evil. I'm not talking about adjectives here. He's a subject who wants something. George is what we are. He represents us humans. He's destroying this world as we all are. We're all raping... - Yeah, we'll do that. So what about Cathrine's... Cathrine! Cathrine! Sorry. Did I hurt you? I'm sorry. I'm still not off book, - so let's not change things all the time. I'm having trouble learning this. I have a show every night. Yeah. I also thought about... I mean, there's the rape. Okay. - Please, let's not change anything. I'd like us to agree on how to do the rape. Now it's different every time. - Different in what way? I think it would be good to decide on what it will be like. I can't explain it better than this. - Do you feel unsafe? No. Definitely not. I'd just like us to determine a beat for the penetration - so that Ville and I are in sync - and it doesn't look funny. Or awkward. Yeah. Just say if you feel uncomfortable. The point is to make it feel real to the audience. Just tell us how you want it. Is it okay if I hold you here? Like this? - Yeah. Would this be okay? - It looks good. If he tears it here in the rape scene, - it can be easily fixed. Tuula will make you extra corsets just in case. What about the dress for the killing scene? I was thinking it could be one of these. I have to talk to makeup. Maybe I can hide a blood bag here. And I need to find fabric that can be cleaned easily - because if you do fifty or hundred shows... I tested the blood already, and it wouldn't wash off. I have to google and think about it. But this is the dress for the rape? - Yes. Listen to Mika. - If you don't come with us, - you'll tear our hearts and souls out of our chests, - stomp on them and burn them to death. Don't burn anything. I'll never be able to love again if you don't come with us. I'm sorry, but I have other things to do. Nice pantyhose. They look nice on you because you have nice legs. Finally I see you smile. Hey. - This is nice material. Tight. Whole meat, unsliced quality meat. No fucking way. Right... Ignoramuses. Whoa. So you think you're a bit better than us, huh? What's wrong with you? C'mon, take the sand out of your vagina. Yep. I can hear the crunching. Can you? C'mon, come with us. Okay? We can wash the sand out of your vagina. Ew, fuck. Ew, fuck. - Fucking gross. Miss, did you forget to change your tampon, or why do I smell shit? Stop. - What a stench. Where's your sense of humor? Don't be so uptight. Why are you so thin-skinned? Don't take things so seriously. What's the matter? You've been sniffed before. Darling, where are you going? - This is my stop. Calm down. Calm down. You don't have to go anywhere. I have to go. - This isn't our stop yet. No panic! Ew, fuck! Good job, Maria! Lower! Good job! Pena's team wins! Thank you. That was great. Being a CEO is child's play compared to this. Good job, our team. Good job, everyone at Finance Whiz! 25 years! - And 25 more to come! 125 more! All right. Now we'll have fun. This is your night. I couldn't hit it. Tatu. Katja. Unbelievable. - Long time. Great. - Nice to see you. These days you don't know if you can hug people. Ah, haven't we heard enough of those harassment stories. I mean, it's not that common. - Fortunately. I've never experienced anything like that. Neither have I. - I haven't experienced it, either. Except the usual ones. What do you mean by "the usual ones"? I mean the ones I'm sure we all have. Being approached by child molesters as a kid - and men exposing themselves to you on the bus, in the park. Yeah, but... - And men grabbing your ass. Well, if that counts... When I was younger, men would catcall me a lot. Some would try to buy sex from me. Some would follow me on the street. That doesn't happen so much anymore, of course. - Right. That's what it was like back then. But it was only a couple of years ago - when I was in a bar - and a guy tried to get into the toilet stall with me. And it was a bit unpleasant at the after-party last year - when Jari... grabbed me - and tried to force me - to have sex with him. You mean our Jari? I guess you can never know another person fully. Didn't an intern... Hi. Didn't she say something about Jari's behavior? Did he do something similar to her? Jari has never behaved inappropriately towards me. But everyone knows he shouldn't drink, though. - True. It's horrible that Katja has kept this to herself - and just had to cope. Katja herself was in a pretty... interesting shape. She danced really erotically at the night club. You can't blame her for it. Miia! You did a great job arranging this party. What are you talking about? I'll go get another drink. Why did she have to dig up those kinds of negative things - on a night like this? Couldn't she focus on the positive? We have wonderful male colleagues, for example. People never talk about them. If you started talking about negative things, - our jaws would drop. Everyone would be horrified. That's a party for you. - That's right. Hey. - You like this? Well, yeah, but... Just lie still. Hey. I don't want anything like that. You don't have to do anything. Stop. Hey. Stop. All right. Get back on the floor. Hey. How about we just... I don't have to put it in or anything. We'd just be close. What are you doing? - Huh? Are you jerking off? - What? You're jerking off. So what? I have to do something about this. Hey. I'm a good guy, really. - Get the hell out. What? - Get the hell out. Go away, please. Hey. Do you think I'm going to rape you or something? Ew, fuck. Ew, fuck. How's the Bentotech case coming along? It's looking good. - Great. I trust you. Aleksi, since Risto is on sick leave, - you could step into the ring. If you feel you're ready. - Sure. It should be an open and shut case. Just read the material well. Great. When is it? - Tomorrow. You have plenty of time. There's always a first time. You need experience with all kinds of cases. Virpi will help you. - Yeah. I'll take care of it. You can't go in there. You have to walk up the ramp. What's the date? What? The 16th? Okay. We'll do that. Thanks. Talk to you. All right. - Kari said you have a case for me. Yeah, I have them here. Which one do you want? One of Risto's case. The work after-party one? The drugging of a minor one? The summer festival one? The one that's tomorrow. - Tomorrow? Oh, the toilet one. It fell in your lap, huh? Yeah, Risto's out once again. I'm sorry about the schedule. So... Yeah. All right, this kind of guy. Goddammit. Why didn't they ask the friend to testify? - I don't know. Well, at least they didn't screw up the forensics. I'd help you, but I have to be in appellate court in an hour - and I have a parent-teacher conference in the evening. I'll take care of this. This is Aleksi Salonen, hi. I have a couple of quick questions about tomorrow's case, - so could you please call me when you get this message. This is Aleksi Salonen, hi. You're the victim's lawyer. I'd like to go over the instructions quickly. Yeah. Yeah, I'll make sure they use different entrances. Not eating anything? - I'm not hungry this early. Don't get too skinny. Women need some meat on their bones. Juha, I wanted to discuss the rape. Yeah. - I was wondering if it's too much. Or what do you think? Will it take away intensity from the killing? I mean... Yeah. I get it. I get it. The first act should give people hope. I think the end should be as touching as possible. George destroys - the most beautiful thing in his life. Like Robert de Niro in Once Upon a Time in America, - he destroys it. He was never able to handle his happiness. Yes, Ville. And Emppu, let's do it as safely as possible. Of course it has to be safe. When I was doing A Streetcar Named Desire - with Pipsa, I told her to punch me if I got too intense. But we have to go into the unknown zone. - Yes. And face the unknown. - Absolutely. We need a lot of dresses because they'll be torn apart. I think Ulla already started making them. Let's cut the rape. I'll go talk to the wardrobe people. Have you seen Once Upon a Time in America? It's amazing. I'm Pena, the company's founder go grab yourself a vodka The atmosphere here ain't something out of Kafka We have a great dynamic gang Whatever we got going on it's a great thang Listen up, before I say goodbye Pena and his people won't leave you high and dry Men. It looks good. - Thanks. He shouted to the stage manager, "Take the rocking chair out!" What about this feedback? "A very interesting play." "No, it wasn't." How's rehearsal going? Is Juha, like, "Yeah, I get it"? "Yeah, I get it." And he doesn't get anything. You never know what he wants. Okay, time to get back to work. - Bye. By the way... I have to tell you something. - Yeah? I had a pretty crazy dream last night. About you. - Okay. I mean, it was... Nothing. I mean it was crazy because of its genre. Okay. Forget about it. Okay. Emppu. - This is Jenni-Elina from Best Films. Hi. - We're making an original TV series. The shooting starts next month. Our director would like you to be in it. - Okay. Would you be interested? Do you have time? - Sure. I have time. - Great. The series is about a cop who returns to his hometown. You'd play a young woman who was raped - and whose body was found in a trunk. It's a one-day gig, and you have no lines, - so unfortunately we can't pay you union wages. What's wrong? - Stand still, harlot. I haven't done anything. In God's eyes, my conscience is clear. I swear. You have to die. - God have mercy on me. Shut up, whore. Do I have to watch you cry over him? Kill... Leave me... Leave me, but don't kill me. By the way, the fight in the first act. We took the rape out. I just discussed it with Juha. From 10? - Yes. Everyone thought it was unnecessary. Yeah. Productional intervention! I sent the others away, so we can rehearse in private. We could go over the fight now that we changed it. - Yeah. But we have to put the rape back in. Ville and I discussed it. It's important that George is - on the dark side already at that point. - Right. His jealousy has to show. Yeah. I think I have to go tell the wardrobe people. I forgot to go there, so no permanent harm done. But I was thinking that we could do the killing - in a stylized manner. Cathrine's lines and cries for help would be heard on a tape. We want to say this is what happens to women - all the time all over the world. That's the theme. Emppu, it would be great if you could go to the studio today. It's unfair you don't have to learn your lines. Okay, let's set the wheels in motion. Shall we do the rape or the killing first? - The killing. Help. - Don't move! Do you want me to go say something to him? Don't. Don't look at me pitifully. It makes me anxious. Don't pity me. Pity that fucking loser. Besides, what would you say to him? He'd deny everything. You'd look like a troublemaker. I don't want to give him any more power. I wasn't going to pick a fist fight with him. I'm sure you're pissed off too. You're embarrassed on behalf of all men. Well, yes, on behalf of all men in the world. I didn't mean it that way, and I'm not accusing you, - but I'm sure you're pissed. - Of course I am. But I don't want to feel embarrassed on behalf of all chauvinists, - since I'm not one of them. I should go grope him. Grab his balls and see how he reacts. Huh? Shall I go? Of course I won't. I won't. Can we forget that fucking asshole? Can you check out the fado places for tomorrow? - Okay. On Friday, there's classic fado, - and on Sunday, more modern. I'm interested in... Go away. Hilla. Hilla. Should we get going? I think this MeToo movement has gone too far. Suddenly everyone remembers something. Suddenly all men have harassed somebody. Women want a manhunt. No one has harassed me here. I have no experience of that. Maybe it's because my sense of humor is a bit raunchier. Or maybe they thought I wasn't pretty enough. C'mon... But this is a real pity. People always talk about men harassing women, - but women have grabbed my ass at nightclubs. Fucking gross. - Yeah. Drunk women can behave nasty. There are definitely horrible women too. It's awful that men are always blamed. Hi. Jari, hi. What's up, man? - In a party mood. In a party mood. This should be the best cherry liqueur in town. Insanely delicious. - Yeah. What? - Nothing. I can hear it's not "nothing." Say it. Can't we just try to forget it? - "We"? "It"? I'm doing my best so that the piece of shit doesn't define our evening. Don't you fucking understand? You just have to be on my side. And show me empathy if you're capable of it. Are you so stupid - you don't understand how gross I feel? And why weren't you outraged when he groped me? I wonder how many people thought - what a loser husband you are for not defending your wife. So you did want me to say something to him. What would I have said to him? "As the owner of my wife, - I'm telling you, you piece of shit, not to grope my wife." If I had yelled at him, you'd be yelling at me now, - saying, "Women can defend themselves." I did defend myself. I was the only one who reacted. He didn't even turn to look. No one helped me. I don't want to be silent, but if I yell, I'm labeled a psycho. And I couldn't grope him back - because that would make me equally horrible. Just one grope, and all I can be is a victim. You defended yourself. The man just grabbed your ass once. It's not like you were raped. Good morning, Milja. Quick, take a seat. The class started a long time ago. Your parents will be notified about your coming late. Okay, let's get to the point. Study pages 35-75 for the test. Open your books to page 73. Let's go over what you remember. Let's start. I wonder what's with her again. Mikko, take out your book. Milja. Are you okay? Has something happened? No, I'm okay. I'm sorry I was late. Good. So, take out... Good morning, Risto. This is Aleksi Salonen again. I'm on my way to court, so please call me back. Hey, you forgot this. You left the milk on the kitchen table. No, it's here. - All right. Hi. I don't think we've officially met. - We haven't. Hi. I haven't been able to reach Risto, - and I was thinking - the penal order looks quite lenient. - You're right. I was just wondering why Risto issued such a lenient one. He issues his penal orders according to the average. I'm going to demand a harsher penalty. - Okay. Good luck. Hi, Nina. - Hi. This is Aleksi Salonen. He's the prosecutor today. Oh. Hello. - Hello. Everything will be okay. I'll take care of this. No fucking way. How is it possible that he's here? I don't understand... I told them to bring him in through the other entrance. Listen. Positive reinforcement. It works on kids, dogs... - I know. I have an idea. That's a wonderful idea, Miia. - Yes. Johannes! Johannes. Come here. We girls thought, or actually decided, - that we want to reward the good men in our company. Men like you. We want to give you positive attention. And the award goes to you. Thank you. Why did I get this award? Because you don't behave inappropriately towards women. An award for not harassing you? - Yeah. Exactly. Thanks a fuck of a lot. The complainant and the defendant - were at the house of the complainant's friend - after a night out. The defendant proposed oral sex in the toilet, - and the complainant refused. The defendant grabbed the complainant's throat tightly, - dragged her to the toilet - and pushed her to the floor on her back. The defendant slapped the complainant - multiple times in the head, - kicked her in the back and squeezed her wrist. The defendant held his hand over the complainant's mouth - and threatened to kill her if she shouted. He penetrated the complainant anally with his penis. While strangling the complainant, - the defendant penetrated the complainant vaginally. The complainant struggled in the beginning - but submitted due to the strangulation - and the threat of being killed. The claimant lost consciousness, - after which the defendant slapped her face multiple times, - after which the complainant regained consciousness. This is aggravated rape because it was committed - in a brutal and humiliating manner - against a victim who's substantially smaller than the defendant. The rape is aggravated also when assessed as a whole. A prison sentence is the correct penalty for this crime. When determining compensation for the complainant, - the manner in which the defendant violated - the complainant's physical integrity and sexual rights - must be taken into consideration. Your honor, the defendant denies these charges. The defendant maintains he hasn't acted in a manner - alleged in the charges. The defendant claims the sex was consensual. In the event these allegations are proven, - the crime is, at the most, coercion into intercourse or rape - as cited in Chapter 20, Section 3, of the Criminal Code, - but not aggravated rape. The defense wishes to point out that according to the documents, - this incident wasn't the only thing that contributed to the damages. The defense would also like to point out - that the defendant is now studying at a trade school. The defense finds the claims for the damages too high - in regards to pain and suffering... Does Katja have a reason to ruin our nice party, - or what's going on? You've put so much effort into throwing this party. I'm sure she didn't want to ruin the mood. What happened to her is a serious thing. Of course I wonder what her motive is - when she brings up something that happened such a long time ago. I've always thought Katja wants attention. She doesn't take other people's feelings into consideration. And she's competitive. Maybe she wants revenge against Jari? I mean, Katja wanted the team leader position - but Jari chose you, Liisa. Well... I haven't experienced anything like it. People don't think that, do they? But if Katja's experience is brought to light later, - it'll look like our whole team and department supports - that kind of behavior. Especially if people find out we've known about it. I'm sure Katja wouldn't do that. - That's what I'm asking. I'll go talk to her. Hey, what's the incident everyone's talking about? People are saying Jari almost tried to rape you. What? No, no... - No? He didn't try to rape me. - What then? He held me down... - What? I can't hear you. He held me down. - Yeah. And? - He groped me. He lifted my skirt and... wouldn't let me go. I managed to break free. I don't think he would've gone all the way. Well, that's not okay. We have to look into it. I mean, Jari is our COO. - I didn't want anything official. At the very least, the team leaders will lose their reputation - if we protect someone who harasses people. I'm not ready for something official. These kinds of incidents have to be sorted out. You can't tell stories like that and not do anything. Do you have evidence? Well. Okay. Listen. You should be careful. You can easily get charged with defamation. Can you hear me? This isn't working. I asked you to check that booth. Help! Someone help me! I haven't... I haven't done anything. I haven't done anything. I haven't done anything! Help! Someone help me! Can anybody hear me? We waited two years for this trial. First the police were slow, then the prosecution. Then we couldn't get the defendant in court, - and then Risto's on sick leave again, and they send... At least you got him a prison sentence. - Will he appeal? Probably. - But he'll go to prison. For how long? - Ten months. The length of the prison term is determined - based on the type of violence. Since no weapon was used, this wasn't aggravated rape. The average sentence for rape is 18 months. As a first-time offender, he'll do 4.5 months with good behavior. But he'll appeal, and we'll go to appellate court, - and he'll get a suspended sentence. I have to come here for the fourth time? - Probably. Honey. Please come to the balcony. I'm sorry I didn't know what to do. I'm sorry I yelled at you. - You don't have to apologize. Of course I understand you. I completely understand. I checked out the fado clubs. This place called Anabela sounds interesting. All the locals go there. We could go there tomorrow. Then there's the Maritime Museum, but that's open every day. I've always supported equal rights. When I founded the company, in the deepest recession, - no one dared hire women. But I did, and not only for the accounting department. In 1996, we had the highest number of women - working in property management in the country. I think you've always treated us equally. Look around. Half the people here are women. And now I'm being accused of allowing things like that. Pena, you shouldn't get upset. - This feels so unfair. It is unfair. - Am I the monster here? No, no. This is just hearsay. We don't have any evidence of anything. There's no need to get upset over something like this. This is horrible... - Let's hug. Help! Someone help me! Can anybody hear me? Don't move, harlot! - What's wrong with you? Look the truth in the eye for the last time! I haven't done anything! Leave me, but don't kill me. I have to do it! - I haven't done anything! Die, whore! Die, my love! Help me! Somebody help me! Can anybody hear me? Why won't this piece of shit fold? - Give it to me. Why did you take it with us? Because I had to spend the whole fucking day - waiting in the hall. - Have you noticed... Stop nagging. - ...that people just carry the seat. Fuck! I heard you won. - It should've been aggravated rape. But he got a prison sentence. He's going to appeal. - A win is a win anyway. Virpi said you did a good job. I told her you'd help her for a while. I think she's pretty busy. - There are a lot of cases like this one? You'll do fine. These cases are pretty basic. But we'll find you something bigger next time. 200,000 for the state. Congratulations. - Thanks. Maija and Taneli are great. I'll sign you both up for the financial crimes cruise. You can grab a beer with us if you want. There's at least 30 minutes left of happy hour. We'll have an after-party. Thanks, guys. Great job. - Thanks. Thanks on behalf of the theater. It was amazing. - Thanks. How does your schedule for next spring look? We're doing a play about human trafficking. Would you be interested? I actually already talked to Juha about it. You have one new message. Congratulations, sis! You're a mega star - and Finland's best actress. I was so annoyed I couldn't make it. The kids want to sing for you: Happy premiere to you Happy premiere to you Happy premiere, dear Emppu Press the hashtag symbol to listen to this message again.
