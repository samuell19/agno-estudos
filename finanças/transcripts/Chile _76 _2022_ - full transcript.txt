Here, like this. Do you see how they painted the houses in that color? There was another one I liked too... I marked it somewhere... It was pink... This! Nice. Here. Thanks. Let’s see. That's much closer! Some more blue maybe? Alright, more blue. Yes. That one! The one with the red jacket! Let me go! They are taking me! Shut up, motherfucker! I am Marcela Ulloa! I am Marcela Ulloa! 5, 7, 8, 6, 0 - Shut up! Let go of me! Let go of me! What was that? Something in the street. These kids won't stop. They should have understood by now. This is the third time we have this on the street. Rubén! Put the curtain down. Come on, Rubén. What happened to her? Excuse me Madam. Madam, look! Here it is. - Have a good day, Madam. - Thanks. Estelita, can you please pass me my pills from the glove box? Welcome Chile! Welcome to our friends from the Americas. Here are the music and news from our motherland. Two. Thanks. And the fags. Dear God, how messy. There. There's nothing here! I'm sure I left them in there. How strange. There is a prohibition to address politics. If this is violated, we will be forced to take the necessary measures. Bummer... Let’s see how long this clean up lasts. She's here. Is she? Good morning, Madam. Good morning. - Let me help you over here. - I'll do the rack. How is it going? Everything all right, Madam. How was your trip Madam? Good, thank you. I'll go get the bags! Where are the blankets boss? Estela! What? They're in the tent. What happened? Look at this dog. Get out of there! Get out! Let's take the sacks to the back. Come here Perlita! Just leave her! Carmen... Carmen... Miguel? It’s me, you crazy lady. Father! I’m sorry… I couldn’t sleep at all last night. I’ll leave you to it then. No, no, no. You can stay, please stay. - Shall I open the curtains? - Sure. Looks like I’ll have to come give mass here, in your bed! Did you have any breakfast, father? A while ago. I’ll ask Estela to make you some toast. Estela! Let her be, she's making lunch. Just give some of your coffee, I'll be fine. - I talked to Miguel this morning. - Here. He said you should call him. Such a control freak. I brought a lot of clothes. A bunch of shoes, for little kids. Great! Poor children, barefoot in this cold. I also brought some shirts for you. So you can replace those old ones! You're sweet. Why do you worry so much! Look at you! That collar! You're so scruffy. Not on my watch. Will you come a bit early to church with me? Sure, but you'll have to wait a bit, look at me, all messy, I can't leave looking like this. What do you need? You look tired, Father. Looks like I'm dying soon! What's his name? Elías. How old is he? 24, 25... He's just a kid. I could talk to Miguel, so they take a look at him locally. That's not possible. You should take a look first, then we'll take him to the hospital. I'm not a doctor Father. You're still here? Good afternoon Julita. Good afternoon. The coffee cake is ready. Thanks. We came to give Father Elías some company. Of course. After you are done, do get some rest. Yes Father. - See you later. - See you later. Here. Come in. Do you want to try the cake? No, thanks. Maybe some cognac. - You don’t know what you’re missing. - Thanks. That woman bakes like a nun! It’d be ten years in jail. That’s terrible, isn’t it? Ten years? Right. He has a record. Have a piece. Fine, if you say insist. So? Delicious. Takes me back. Look, this kid was stealing because he didn’t have anything to eat. He's a starving Christ. If I wasn't sure that you could do it, I wouldn't ask. I have no one else to go to. Here. What you asked for. Thank you, Father. - Have a good night. - Thanks, good night. Mrs. Pizarro was telling me that apparently they left the country. I can't believe it! The blue one? The one with the tiles? How sad! It’s a beautiful house. Hello. Thanks. - You can go in, Carmen. - Thank you very much. - What a beautiful coat! - Thanks. Could you get me some antibiotics from the hospital? No, no, no. No, it’s Father Sánchez. It’s for one of these girls who botched an abortion. So brutal. I know. They can’t, they'll be sent to jail if they go to the hospital. No. They won’t go, Miguel. They’ll die. Then give me a prescription. Why not? You write it, and I’ll get it filled here. Who will recognize your name in this tiny town? Ok. Sure. I got it, I got it. I hope that when I am dying you can prescribe me some. No, you are the silly one. Alright. Liar. I have to go, this call is costing me a fortune. Bring some warm clothes, it’s cold. Should I cut these in half too? No. I'm going to raise the dosage. You’ll die one of these days… So many pills. Excuse me Madam, can I get some water? What about the tap outside? Is it not working? No. Ok, come in. Excuse me. I made some lentils. Didn't we say we would cook some meat? Thank you, excuse me. - Would you like some fruit? - No, thanks. Please clean up your shoes next time. Why would you offer them fruit if I’m giving them lunch? Does it matter? When he finished the milk and the cookies, his eyes turned misty, and something warm rolled over his nose and fell into the glass. A terrible cry shook him to his core. He held his head in his hands, and sobbed, for a long time. He sobbed with grief, with anger, with the need to sob, he sobbed as if he had never - - Good afternoon, Father. - Good afternoon. Please continue. As if he had never sobbed before. He was bent over, crying when he felt a hand stroking his tired head. He heard the voice of a woman with a sweet Spanish accent say “Cry, son, cry.” What do you think? Just like the book! Very nice. Old lady! Tomás, my love! Long time no see! You’re so ungrateful - you never come home anymore! Don’t say that! They’re holding me hostage in that hospital! - I am on call every night, you know. - How sad. Estelita! - So nice to see you. How are you? - How are you, Miguel? How are my girls doing? All good, Miguel. All good in here. My love! New haircut! Yes! A little tidy up. It was too long! He looks so cute. He looked like a hippie! Come here! Come, come, come. I want to show you something I brought for you. Where's Leo? Right behind us. Here. Let me look at you. You look tired… Have you been getting any sleep? Not much. - Look over here. - What? Move that thing over. - Come on, you’re crazy! - So you can watch your movies! Hey man! Help us with these things please! You will use it much more than me. Looks like you weren’t so bored in Santiago. - Excuse me Madam. - Thanks. Hello! Hi, hi, hi! - Hi mom. - Hi. - How was the trip? - You know. Run, run, run! Elenita, come here! Hello my sweetie pie! My beautiful Elena! Careful! Careful! Get down! Hello Madam, how are you? Fine, darling. And you? Did you get the flounder? It arrived, it’s ready, thank you. Was it fresh? It was alive! Granny! Clarita! Come say hi to your grandma. Be careful! Hi! Hi! Look at that dress! So pretty! I don’t like it. Don't even mention it. She made such a fuss. But you look like a doll! I don’t want to be a doll. What do you want to be then? A wild animal. This crazy American woman, she took all these photos... ...with the lens cap on! And she didn’t realize? No, it was one of those cameras where you look through the viewfinder. - She didn't realize! - You didn’t say anything? No, I couldn't stop laughing! - You didn't say a word! - No... She took all these photos, with the lens cap on! We’re so dark, Chileans. What a sad country. Clarita, come over. Tomás, Carmen told me you decided on traumatology. Yes, he’s doing great. This guy, such a mechanic. That’s great! He’ll change all the bolts on us oldies! Those bolts need to be changed by a psychiatrist, Father! He's not only a mechanic, he's a also a comedian! He is right, sadly. Miguel, the men are waiting, they want to discuss money with you. Get them to take down the tent first. We'll talk after. Painter, architect... They got you working mom! Yes! I thought I was retired. Retired from what? From raising you two! You’ll have to cash in your pension, before they privatize everything. That's actually better than the government stealing it all. We’ll see who the thieves are. Hey, don’t start! Why would you talk about these things? Pass me the bottle. Father? Thanks. Some more? Enough, thank you. - Anybody else? - No, thanks. Cheers! How are things around here, Father? Good, good. No news over here. What do you mean no news? We heard everything. What? Mom is a literature teacher now. What? Right… I’m doing some readings for the blind. How great is that! Thanks for keeping her busy Father. It was a wonderful idea, Father. - Good afternoon, Carmen. - Good afternoon. - How are you? - Good, thanks. Good afternoon. Please come in. Thanks for everything, Madam. Don't leave. Please don't leave. You should take your dog to the vet. We tried. But we didn’t find anybody. This is my Red Cross ID. This is from 1943, ma’am. Right, but my husband is a doctor. He is doctor Miguel Orellana. He is a service director at the Barros Luco hospital, in Santiago. Why didn’t he come? He stayed with the dog. How is the wound? Deep. How many kits do you need? How about 4? And some penicillin? Or antibiotics? Whatever you might have. Your dog, how much does he weigh? Fifty kilos? He’s quite big. Just a moment. This will hurt a little bit. Here we go. Breathe. There, there. Look at this one. Colonel Rojas gave it to me. The one you did the colectomy on? Look how happy he was. Carmen, what are you drinking? Those military guys, they know how to drink. How about a Coke? Aren’t we supposed to try the whisky? Look at her! She’s always been smart. Smart and gorgeous. What is your secret? Just neurosis. Have you taken your Meprobamate? Yes, but it has no effect on me. What? How much did I give her last time? Fifty. Just raise it, give her a hundred. - But she self-medicates like crazy! - You too. I don’t know why I even went to med school. I’m just a nobody at home. It gives me horrible headaches and dizziness. Sure, but you know what happens? She mixes them with alcohol. And I’ve lost the fight against cigarettes too. Look, any little pill plus alcohol is pure poison. I know from my own experience. I lost it, this one time. I couldn’t move. I got all pale. I couldn’t even blink. Were you there? Of course I was! With Javier Ponce... Ponce! We had to drag him, he was just dead weight! And he was chatting bullshit the whole time! - That’s terrible. I don’t remember anything! - Lucky you! What did he say? “The devil is taking me!” The devil! What is Ponce doing? Prosthetics. He is doing those. Doing great. The future is in prosthetics. Look, that is your mom! I knew she had lied to us about having short hair! And that is auntie Margarita! She was quite chubby. Look mom, you are in the film! Hi, honey. - What’s this? - Little Andrés found it. Hello mom. - How did it go? - Not good. - No dates left? - Nothing. - They're all booked. - Right, it's the winter holidays. And your dad? He stayed at the club. Having drinks with his new boss. Mom, is that you? Yeah. Look at you. So beautiful. What a sad vacation. Why was it sad? I’m only joking Clarita. - Because granny went crazy. - Mom! Why? What do you mean? She took off. Took off where granny? Nowhere kiddo. It’s just your Grandma saying things. Estela, come over here! Look! My sweetie, how cute! She was so fussy! Do you remember, Leito? She cried her eyes out. Darling, let's just do the party in here. This house is like a bomb site. Where would we fit all those kids? It should be ready by then. Estela can make her millefeuille. No, no, no, no. Don’t bring me into this, the millefeuille is the one I am the worst at. You make a great one. I’m sorry but I’m not a baker. Dear God, this grumpy old lady! Don't listen to her. I'll ask Julita, who is very sweet, and she will make a great one. We’ll have it here, Ok? How you do you know how to do all this? Washing hair? No... Treating wounds, that kind of thing. I was in the Red Cross. Many years ago. I wanted to study medicine. What happened? It wasn’t something I could do back then. Why? My father. He was a bit old-fashioned. I was his little girl. And he wanted me to get married, and all of that. You can lean on me! I’m thin but I’m strong! Alright. Thanks. Did you tell your husband? What? This. That you’re helping me. No. Why? Would he be angry if he knew? The Father asked me not to say anything. Alright. What did the priest say about me? That you’re a common criminal. Close your eyes, my love. Flour, baking powder, beans. They lost track of time. Salt. Rice. An army patrol picked them up and no one’s seen them since. Is that it? No, no, no. We're missing... Dish soap, hand soap, and some tea towels please. Why did they shoot you? Did the priest say anything? No. But sometimes priests lie. You’re not a common criminal. Why? I don’t know. I just don’t think so. No. I’m not a common criminal. What are you then? If they find me here, and they take me with them, they will torture me. If they torture me, I could give away the priest’s name. Or mine. I don’t know your name. I don’t know who you are. You don't have anybody who can take you in? No. I can’t see my family. I lost touch. I can’t reach out to my comrades. Can’t you call them? We don’t speak on the phone. The only way to do it is in person. How? It’s dangerous. I know this lady. She lives on her own. A very good person. She’ll be able to take him in. It’s too dangerous him being here. Sure, but so is that lady taking a criminal into her home. He’ll pass for a student from the countryside. I don't think so. He’s not going with her. How do you know? - Did he tell you? - No. He didn’t tell me anything. It’s not that I don’t want to protect him. You understand? Yes. Would you have helped me if I had told you the truth? I don't think so. After the coup, I was asked to protect a couple of kids, this young couple. They were with me for three or four days. I got scared, and I thought they would detain me, for protecting extremists. So I called the manager of the Yacht Club. The navy came, and they took them. They found them in Argentina. Murdered. It was my fault. The door! Come on, open the door! Can’t you hear the lady with the baby? Excuse me. Do you know where I could buy some pasta? - No. - No? But they told me that around the corner they’re selling guitars. Take your scarf off. Let’s walk. Put the bread away. How are things? Good. A little nervous. I meant with Elías. How is he? Right. He’s good. Better. Is he hurt? Yes, he was shot in the leg, but he’s much better now. Is he able to walk? No. Not yet. But will he be able to walk? Yes. Soon. Should be soon. I’ll leave you now. You have to take the bus, then when you get off, you walk a bit, then take another bus, and then you go home. - Right. He explained that. - Good. You will be Cleopatra. Do you like it? Sure. Tell Elias that Silvia is very happy to know that he is well. And tell him we are going to do the fourth point. The fourth point. Fourth point, yes. Walk fast! Look down! Come on, come on. No it’s fine. False alarm. You’re pale. I got scared. Alright. You can go now. Don’t follow me. Excuse me. Thank you. Esteli... Estelita... Estela! Carmen! Dear God, I was worried. The church was quite far. Sit down, let me get you some food. And the kids? They went to bed a while ago. These matches are terrible! So she scared me on purpose? What happens if I say something because they’re torturing me? And I reveal the point of contact. The day, the street, the time, the piece of bread? She needs to make sure you’re not an intelligence officer, that’s why she had to scare you. To make sure that you react as a human being. I almost died. That's how human I am. I'm sorry. When we take out these murderers, we will reward you for all of this. Really? How? We will name a hospital after you. Cleopatra. No, your real name. But you don’t know my real name. Saint Cleopatra then. What happens at the fourth point? They will give you instructions, so they can come and get me. We'll never see each other again. Until we open the Saint Cleopatra hospital. Will it look like a pyramid? It would look more like a grave, than a hospital. That's true. Let's see. It’s uneven in the back. Don’t worry. I hope that happens. What? That you win. It’s only one more my love. Right, it’s for one of the girls. The other one is doing much better. Yes. Look, bring me some bandages, and povidone. And that’s that. Whatever you can my love. Hello? Tomás? Son? Can you hear me? Can you hear that noise? Must be here. Yes, antibiotics… Wait. I’ll call you later. I can barely hear you. Bye. Miguel didn’t have any holidays? No, he’s too busy. - Have a good night. - Night. Once upon a time, there were three kids, walking next to a cliff. Careful there, Andrés! Yeah! Clarita, go slowly. Clarita, give me your hand! What’s that? Be careful. What is that? What happened, Grandma? Nothing my love, nothing… Keep going. Let’s go to the other beach now, ok? Keep going, slowly. Hey, wait for me! Grandma! Let’s go to the next one! How do you want to die? How many times? One for every time they hit me! What do you think? Coming up next, a nationwide address from his excellency, the President of the Republic, General Augusto Pinochet Ugarte. Granny, I can't fix it. Why did they stop the movie? - For the national broadcast. - Exactly. When is it coming back on? We don’t know love. Why don’t you put your pajamas on? - No! - No! I don’t want to. Alright, go put your pajamas on. Estela! Chile was a destroyed nation, a society with a broken spirit and a social structure that was divided and corrupt. A reorganization was needed on all fronts, and we introduced various measures to reach achieve this. “Beautiful young woman murdered and thrown in the ocean” “Beautiful young woman strangled" Excuse me. Do you know where I could find a broom? I don’t, I'm sorry. What if they were following me, because they knew where the meeting point was? No. They would have taken you. Maybe they just wanted to follow me. Did you do the thing with the buses? Yes. Ok, then. So it would have been too hard to follow you. Maybe I shouldn’t have come. No, it’s ok. But I should leave this place. I'm such an idiot. Calm down. You did what you had to do. Father is going crazy. He’s might just call the army himself. Father? No. No, I’ll talk to him. Don’t worry. No-stay quiet. Is there no other meeting point? No. The chain is broken now. They won’t make it. What about the priest in the slum? Or anyone else we can contact? Good evening. Papers, please. Turn the car off. Of course. - Are you from Santiago? - Yes. What are you doing in the area? These are the wrong ones. Winter holidays. Here they are. What are you carrying back there? Just some shopping. Are you with your family? Yes. With my grandchildren, I mean. My husband is a doctor, he is a service director at the Barros Luco hospital in Santiago, so he couldn’t have any vacation. Understood. Fuck. Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death. Amen. Hail, Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Here. Have a good night. Thank you. You too. Bye. Damn it! Goodbye. Estela? Are you there? You're here already! Yes. They suspended my afternoon surgery. Where were you? - Estela didn’t tell you? - What? I had to take some donations to a church, it pretty far away. At this hour Carmen? I didn’t think it would take this long. What if they caught you out past curfew? They’d kill you. I don’t like you driving alone at night. It’s very dangerous. More importantly, the children are here, If something were to happen… It won't happen again, it was foolish of me. The TV looks great there. There's just one thing though. What is it? It doesn't work! Here it is! Boss! Got it! Let go now. Enrique! - To your left. - Here? To your left, Enrique. How about there? Up a bit! What's that? Didn't we decide you wouldn't wear it anymore? You have bad memory. I have an excellent memory. I love the way it looks. Miguel! A little higher! Higher? Yes. Shit! Be careful, Enrique! What a beautiful little toy! Raquelita chose it. And I’ll name it. Give it a baptism. How are you doing Carmen? Good. I’m used to it. You are? Do you have a boat too? No, no. Not yet. But we already have a name. Cleopatra. Hey! What a great name! The Egyptians were amazing navigators. Very good ones! I like it. What do you think? - What do you think? - Cleopatra? You don’t like it? Can I hold it? Can I drive? Yes, of course. Hold it firmly! - Pull it towards you. - Got it. How wonderful! I’d like one of these babies! Toward me now. Toward me now, Miguel. Listen to me. He ended up in Havana. He threw away his career. So sad. We have to give him credit, he was an exceptional doctor. But too disorganized, he left all this mess behind him. You have no idea how hard it’s been to clean it up. You need to be very careful about all the new hirings. You know how it is, one bad apple ruins the barrel. Come on Osvaldo! Stop it with the bad apples! I don’t like it. I don’t like it! Even a bad apple would be better than these people. Parasites. Traitors to our country. That hospital of yours is infected with communists. The only good thing in that regard is that we have identified all of them. Come on, Osvaldo. You know it’s not true. I am glad Osvaldo put you in charge. You know why? The people need to be led by someone strong. Chileans have a mediocre mind. And when you live in a mediocre country, you need to be governed by a strong hand. Chileans are lazy. They like warming up their seats. They like to get things for free. Some nice boots, And all these other things. All of those union rules. - What’s going on? - You got sick Carmen? We lost Carmen. - Can I help? - No, no. I’m alright, Miguel. Don’t worry. - Have a seat, have a seat. - I’ll just go to the toilet. Help her, Miguel! Settle down. Breathe, my love. Breathe. - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. Where is the Santa Marta slum? Where are you from? Santiago. You’re coming from there? No, no. I have a summer house around here… Where? On the other side of the bay. That’s far. What a good Christian. Did you come by car? Yes. Why? Are you being watched? No. They would have thrown me into the ocean by now. Is he able to walk? Yes. With difficulty, but yes. Tell him to go to the Barranco market on Sunday. 12 o’clock sharp by the fishmonger’s. Ok. Nothing else? That's all. What would you like Madam? A glass of wine, please. No, forget that. A pisco-coke, please. And a hot-dog. Thanks. Are you visiting? Excuse me? You’re visiting? Right. No. But you’re not from here. No. Thanks. Of course. - Thanks. - You're welcome. You’re not Chilean. Yes, I am Chilean. Why? You seem more European. Italian, French. You’re hungry. Where are you from? I’m an airline stewardess. That’s why! You’re so beautiful I mean. Thanks. Excuse me. May I? Yes. Have a seat. You don’t seem Chilean either. But I am. Why? I don’t know. You just don’t. It’s the way you speak. What do you do? I am a diver. Did you hear about the woman they found at the beach? Yes. I heard. Was she from around here? Looks like she was a foreigner. How do you know? I don’t. - See you soon, Raúl. - See you. You should leave soon Madam. So you don’t break curfew. Should we wait for a few more minutes? In case they come. They’re not coming Madam. Well, let’s get started then. “The Suicidal Shipmates” There are only a few things more terrible to encounter on the sea than an abandoned ship. The danger is minimal by day, but by night the ships sink into darkness without the slightest warning: the crash of the waves launches the ship from one side to the other. These ships that were abandoned either by A or by B, navigate the open seas stubbornly, using the currents or the wind. If the sails are deployed, they wander in the seas, whimsically altering their course. More than a few of the steamships that never returned to port, have surely stumbled upon one of these silent ships that travel by their own accord. Andrés! Elena! Andrés! Clara! Grandma, we’re going past the house! - I know, we’ll put the car in the garage. - Why? Because. Do you remember the dead girl on the beach? Go tell Estela to open the door. Do you remember the dead girl? Go inside. “Key evidence disappears in beach crime case” Good morning. Morning. Thank you. San Antonio, please. Sure. Carmen. What? Can you come here for a minute? What is it? Please come. Alright. Good morning. Good morning. Carmen. Humberto is our neighbor. He has a house right next to the yacht club, and he brought you a little gift. Where were they? Near the Chains beach. What were they doing there? They’re normally in the glovebox. I must have put them in my purse and they just fell out. I didn’t realize. I'm sorry to be rude but I have to get going. I need to get the cake. Right. It’s my grand-daughter’s birthday. - Let me give you another drink. - Thanks. - How old is she? - Seven. Seven years old. Yes, well… Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you too. I should say, try to be more careful next time. You won’t always be this lucky. Of course. She has her head in the clouds. Goodbye. Goodbye. Julita! What happened? They broke in. When? Last night. What about the Father? They sent him abroad. Who? The church. They took him out of the country. And Father Elías? This is horrifying, Carmen. It’s awful. The cake is ready. Thanks. We don't know each other. We haven’t seen each other. I haven’t seen you, you haven’t seen me. You can say that. If they come asking. Just say that. You know what? It was me. I killed him. Hello Carmen! What a beautiful job you’ve done with the house! Beautiful! Thank you! Congratulations! - Carmen! - Hello honey. Hi! Where were you? We were waiting!
