We'll never forget that day. What a blow out! We'd pulled some girls, but they preferred older men. The day before, we'd worked so hard. There were lots but we wanted good ones. We used at least 3 litres of petrol. The should've noticed us, especiall Dan in his shirt. Then we realized we shouldn't choose them in the street. The're all so stuck up. There are too many people in the street, Dan should know. Heart broken by such indifference, we took a break. Aren't you scared of wandering outside alone? Do you live with your parents? So you live with mummy and daddy? Idiot! Did I hurt you? Are you from Cannes? From Paris? They're not from Cannes so they must be on holiday. What are you doing tonight? We're lucky to be going out with them tonight. They're the lucky ones to be with us good lookers. No! She smiled. She's going to speak. Do you like the blond? She looks like Brigitte Bardot. I don't like her shoes! I don't like your face, you idiot. Why aren't you nice to us? What've I done, I'm nice to you. Just leave us alone. I'll kill myself if you don't love me. Go right ahead. I will. Killing yourself's not so bad! Hello. - Taking a walk? - Yes, you too? We're just taking a walk. Are you taking a walk too, ladies? - It'll be better later. - You're no better then? He thought he'd impress them with his car but he scared them off. They walked home alone. We'd almost got them but he ruined it. So we got back to work but we didn't really feel like it. It's all very well having wheels but you can't compete with that. As we were seeing them the next day, we changed tactic. Don't you like my moustache? He can get rid of it, if you like. - There you go! - You again! You don't give up, do you? Shall we go say hello? No, I've had enough of chatting for nothing. But it's 1 pm and we've still not met anyone. Ok, they're not bad. - Where are they taking us? - You'll see. You wanted them to come over. I don't really care. Are you coming? Wait for me. I haven't got any money. - Me neither. - I paid the ice cream last night. That's just great. It's cold, I'm going to be all wet. Sorry, I haven't got any money. Keep my card. What about my watch? - I can leave my Vespa. - OK then. Don't take my snack. - What shall we do? - I don't know. We've had it. Let's keep going. On foot? - There's a nice beach. - Is there? - You keeping yours? - Why change? Are you coming, boys? It didn't get off to such a bad start. This is no time for daydreaming. I told her poignant things. Life is short. That we all grow old. That no one will ever know. That she was pretty. That I liked her. She didn't care. So I told her I loved her. Besides, now with the atomic bomb, none of that really mattered. That's what you get for being sincere. I'm such an idiot. - Did you find any money? - No. - Is that your business, Joe? - We've had it then. We should give up, but what else can we do after dinner at our age? We're not just going to sit and watch TV. So we go out. We were meeting them. The'll already have eaten, so that's good. We only had to be there. - She's beautiful! - Keep your hands off! Nice shoes! - Idiot! - They're all white. Don't touch them! - Hello. - Where are we going? For a ride. Not like that, here. It's not fair. Cannes really is magic at night for us tourists. A sweet wind blows. A feeling of peace washes over us. Our hearts beat rapidly when we think of the upcoming evening. All our troubles begin the moment you pick up a girl. You have to take them somewhere. We just rode up and down the Rue d'Antibes several times, making a racket. We're not sure they liked it, but it woke them up! Petrol's expensive so we couldn't do that all night. They wanted to go to the cinema. We may have liked to. But we like to do things properly. So we took them to a night club. The music's not bad. Shit! Easy! Be serious. I'm going to get angry. You're going to damage her, Joe. - What are you doing? - Come on! He's taking the mickey! The charm ran out there. Unluck. We'd almost got them. I'd had it and my friend wasn't much better off. She was leading him on. He was trying so hard, poor guy. He still thought he was in with a chance. It's sad to see a guy trying that hard for nothing. He had no dignit left. Mabe he didn't realize, but it was over. Shall we go? It's not working. What more do they want? They're so dopey. What about tomorrow? - Forget it. - That's it then. Shall we stop off here? It wasn't a successful night. We didn't lose out on much. It'll be better tomorrow. We'll choose older ones. Why worry? We've got all the time in the world.
