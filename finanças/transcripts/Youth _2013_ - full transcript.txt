Shaul, any way you can get us all in the movie? I told you, Dad, Thursdays are opening nights. Yeah, but I got ltzik to drive us all the way here so Yaki wouldn't have to take the bus, so I thought we could catch a movie. I'll sneak you in during the previews. Let's get a big bucket of popcorn, Moti, live it up a little. Want some popcorn? - Something to drink? No. - No? Come on, well get some popcorn and drinks. When did you get here? About an hour ago. What took you so long? You think this is a joke? - What? I got detained for an hour because of all the messages you sent me. It was urgent, I had to. It wasn't urgent, it could've gotten me into trouble big-time. And delete all the photos. Shaul, sit with us. I'll come back later. The lock? Great song, huh? A real tearjerker. - Gives me goosebumps. You understand why youre deleting them? Yeah. - Yeah, what? Yeah, mind-fucker. Yaki! Come here a minute. When will you be back? - We"re just going for a little spin. Have you been smoking? You can smell it? I just took a puff of ltzik's. What do I tell Mom? - Nothing. She doesn't need to know everything. Why get her upset? If she asks, tell her I'm with ltzik. L"ll be home later. Lets go. I love you. Hi! - Hey. How was the movie? Not so good.

The paycheck was okay. Yeah. Its a big help. Good. Did they give you more hours? - No they didn"t. Why not? You didn't ask? - Mom, what do you think? What did they say? - They said "fine'. I don't want to go to school, I want to hang out with Yaki. You can hang out with him later. I deserve some time off. Time off? Get up. Wipe your face. Skim off the foam. When it boils, lower the flame. Hi, Simon. - Hi. This is my soldier. Keeping us safe, huh? Trying to. Bye, Mom. Everything"ll be okay, Mom. What is this? Your card is full. What do you mean? - There"s one more. What happened? You're okay. I'm going this way. We"ll talk later. Bye. Keep your eyes on the building. - I never saw this place before. Hello? - Shauli, is Yaki with you? He's not answering his phone. - Hes probably with friends. What do you think of car dealers? Car dealers? I don't know. What am I supposed to think? It's a good job, right? - Why, someone offered you a job? I was talking to Yossi... Remember Yossi? Yeah. - He said l"d be good at it. What do you think? I have a way with people. But you don't know anything about cars. Tell Yaki to call me when you see him, okay? I want to ask his opinion... - Dad, I have to go. I'll tell him to call you when I see him, okay? Bye. She just left. Dont move! If you move, we'll shoot. Don't push us. Your only chance to stay alive is to listen to what I say! We"ll start walking now. The rifle is right next to you, just so you don't forget. L"m warning you, one wrong move, one word and you"re dead. Got it? Got it? Move your bag, Id like to sit down. Come on.

She doesn't look like shes suffering. Want me to do it? - No, here. Why don't you rip her dress? - No, no, don"t! Shut up, shut up! Let"s take another one. Wait a second, Yaki. Why'd you say my name? Are you nuts? Keep it together. Put your foot like you're stepping on her. - Like this? Yeah, don"t move. I took it. Looks good to me. Yeah, it"s good. "If you want your daughter back alive, pay us $152,000" Which version are you using? The "alive'" one. It"s the shortest. But... What"s wrong with it? I don"t know. "If you want your daughter back alive, pay us $ 152,000." "To Dad" "Message sent" No, let go of me! No, no! No! Dont leave me here! How many times have you been told not to play here? Fuck off or I shoot. I don"t believe it. We did it. - Whoa! Can you believe it? It's gonna work, right? Lt'll be okay, don"t worry. Come on, Yaki, stop it... Come on, Yaki, cut it out! Yaki, cut it out! You asshole, you promised you"d stop doing that. What's the big deal? - You jerk... Give me some. Fuck! What? The bags are over there. It"s okay, they"re Paula"s sons. Shaul, she wanted some cola, too. Thanks, Margalit. - We just go? - Yeah, l"ll put it on her bill. It's been too long. Why doesn't he respond? Maybe he doesn't understand what he sees. We said that could happen. We"ll call him now. Grab these bottles. Hey, let me help you. - It's okay, I can handle it. Have you been smoking again? - I called before and left a message. Yeah, I saw, and Shaul told me. I wanted to call you back. Then why didnt you? I had some stuff I had to deal with and things to do at home. Never mind. I wanted your advice on something. And to remind you about the haircut. Is that mine? I never recognize the ringtone. Shaul, you said you"d change it. I will. You gonna answer? - No, itll stop in a minute. Here, I'll get it for you. - Nah, itll stop in a minute. Come on... Take it, here. - No, never mind. Hello? Hey, Yossi. Thanks for calling back. No, its okay. Don"t worry, it"s for the best. Thanks anyway. Bye. What is all this stuff? How are we gonna eat all of it? Your mom invited the whole family over. In honor of your enlistment. She didn"t say anything. - Of course not, its a surprise. Did anyone see my cheese? She forgot it again. All this shopping and she forgets the cheese I asked for. What's the big deal? - Shut your mouth. Give me a hand, dont just stand there! He's getting on my nerves. - Leave him be. This is Akiva Edelman. Olease leave a message... - 1, 2... 7, 8... Why did you hang up? Voicemail isn't good enough, we have to speak to him directly. Shut your mouth. I want to take off the gag, but I want to be sure you keep quiet. Are you Arabs? Your mother"s an Arab! Listen good, Dafna. L"m going to call your house. L"ll put it on speakerphone. Ask for your father and tell him you"ve been kidnapped. If he doesn"t pay a ransom of $ 152,000 he can forget about ever seeing his daughter again. Ready? Ready?! This is the Edelmans: Akiva, Gila, Yosef, Gila, Nathan and Dafna. Olease leave a message. Mom, Dad, it's Dafna. L"ve been kidnapped. They want money... Shut up, we hung up! What's with your family, doesnt anyone answer the phone? What time is it? What did you say? What time is it? You still don't get it, we ask the questions. - No, no! Please, no, it's choking me. Youre choking me! Please, it's choking me, lm begging you, please! It's choking me, I can't take it, it"s choking me... No, no, please, no! Shut up! Shut the fuck up! There is nothing we can do. We knew it all along. That's the fucking business. Think of why we"re doing this! Say it! This is for 152,000. She's nothing. She"s a fucking bitch. Say it! This is for 152,000. She's nothing. She"s a fucking bitch. Say it! This is for 152,000. She's nothing. She"s a fucking bitch. Should I say it again? Say it! She"s a fucking bitch. What are you doing? Just wanted to check it out. You"re nuts. We can take turns every week. "'Blocked number" That's gotta be him. - Maybe not. We're gonna miss his call. Lets go down. Come here, help me out with the table. Yaki, why don"t we give you a crew cut before everyone gets here? We're in a hurry, Dad. Well do it tomorrow, okay? Whatever you want. I just wanted you to look good for the meal. Push it. You have thick hair, like your moms family. Prickly like a porcupine. - You always say that. Don't move, lets have some discipline. Maybe l"ll shave your beard. Youll look neater. I can't take it off. Its how I enlisted. Ow! Fuck! Look at him laughing at me. I told you not to move, didn't I? - Then be careful. Okay, then don"t move, don"t curse. Who left the key in the lock? Take off the uniform. One son in the army is enough. Start getting ready. They"ll be here in an hour. We wanted to go out for a minute. - What for? To show Nissim something. - Nissim? Now? Let them go, they said they"ll be right back. Stay out of it. If you had told us before, we wouldnt have arranged to meet. We'll be back in a few minutes. - Bye. Grab hold of her! Bitch! - Let me go! Shut up! Let go of me! Let go of me! "Mom calling" Shut up! Shut up! Do it fast! Come on! I'm going back to loosen it. - Well do it a little later. She can barely breathe. That's the way things are going nowadays, everywhere. Whoever invests, will make money. Seriously, Moti, electric cars? Lts science fiction. Anybody who believes that crap will regret it. Its nonsense, the whole thing. Nothing will ever come out of it. It has to happen. The Arabs have all the oil. It's just a matter of time, a few years. Not everything is in the Arabs"hands. Don"t exaggerate. Paula, how'd you cook the chicken? Same as always. I just added some honey. You can tell. - Its delicious. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank you, Paula, for the great meals you make us, and keeping this house together. May God bless you. Stay healthy for all of us. Amen. Moti, that's a bit much, no? - Why? Cant I compliment my wife? That's going to fall. - It"s okay, itll hold. Well, we've come together here today in honor of our soldier. Hey... - Shaul, what's wrong with you? She took my cellphone. What are you, 4 years old? - Neslie, that"s not nice. Give it back. Neslie, can I have my phone, please? Calm down. But... Do you mind, sweetie? Lt'll keep her at the table a bit longer, okay? Why is your phone pink? What are you, a girl? Neslie! That"s not nice. Apologize. Whose phone is that? Lts not yours. A friend gave it to me. He doesn"t like the touch screen. I don"t like it either. Grosses me out. He just gave it to you? For free? He"s loaded, Mom. So, Yaki, Mom said you"re going into a combat unit. It"s time to make a toast. Pour the wine. Good luck to our combat soldier. To Yaki! Cheers! - To Yaki! Good thing you're here, Yaki. Yeah, otherwise what your mom said would happen, wouldve happened. It"s no big deal, Mom. He never listens. Yeah, but it didn't fall, so why rattle on about it, huh? Cheers, Yaki. - Cheers. Tell us about basic training, Yaki. I don't know... Its like you imagine it would be. Run, drill, sleep, that"s it. Give me back the phone, please. What"ll you give me for it? I'll give you a surprise. What"s the surprise? Dad, your phone. Excuse me. Come to my room, l"ll show you the surprise. Great idea. Go play and we"ll clear the table. Good. Uri, do whatever you want. I don't discuss such things on the Sabbath. It's a holy day. Did you watch all those movies? Yeah. Didnt you get bored of them? A little. So what"s my surprise? One second. You like it? I don"t know, l"ll ask Mommy. Give me the phone! - Don"t want to! What's that? - It"s from the army. That"s nice. Leave it on. There"s something I want to see. Paula, leave the dishes, come sit with us. In a minute. Who's that? - I don"t know. Shaul's girlfriend. Give it to him. Arent you going to answer? III talk to her later. You're embarrassed to talk to her while we"re here? No, III talk to her later. So who is she? Moti, have you met the bride yet? I didn't know there was a girlfriend. She"s just a girl in his class, not a girlfriend. Cut it out. A girlfriend"s not a bad thing. I didnt say it was. Come on, sis, sit with us! Turn off the TV. - Its almost over. Enough. We're all together now, lets talk like human beings. Looking at us now, I realize how fast time goes by. I know. Can you believe Neslie"s in 1 st grade? Wow! 1 st grade? Nesloosh! I remember Shaul in first grade. Like yesterday. I came to school because you fell, remember? Mom, please, not that story again. Have I told it before? I don"t remember. I remember something about a fall. Tell us again. Shaul was a spaced-out kid. He was playing in the yard and fell down. They call me from school, saying that my son fell down and lost his memory. I ran down there. He was in the nurse's office, white as a sheet. I ask him, "'Shaul, are you okay?" But I can see he isn"t. He"s acting strange and has this dazed look on his face. It stressed me out. We get home. He sits in front of the TV and I call Moti. Moti was at work, busy. But he didn"t get upset. He told me to ask Shaul the names of all his WWF figures. I hang up and ask Shaul and he starts telling me every detail, every name. Yakuzoma, Yakuzomi, all of them, all their names. He didn"t forget a single one. I called Moti and told him the boy is fine. Remember that? Of course I do. Moti, are you okay? - Yeah. What's with you? You"ve heard that story so many times. Leave it, Dad, I'll take it. Why should you have to do it? Sit down, it"s okay. Thanks for having us. Take care of yourself, soldier. - Thanks, Grandpa. You take care of your mom. She needs your help now that your brothers not here. Bye, Grandpa. Thanks. Drive carefully. - Thanks. Straight to your savings account. Last push of cleaning and it"s behind us. Drink. I'm sorry things came to this, it should've been over by now. Your father didn"t call. Time is not in your favor. Do you understand your family is getting you into trouble? My family... My family keeps the Sabbath. Thats why they dont answer the phone. What? They observe the Sabbath. They wont answer on Friday night. I'm gonna call them every 5 minutes. This is the Edelmans... This is the Edelmans... They won"t answer. At some point they'll realize you didn't get back, Sabbath or no Sabbath. This is the Edelmans... I do it all the time, dont you get it? I run away from that stupid Sabbath and come back on Sunday. They're used to it. They won"t pick up. This is the Edelmans... This is the Edelmans... What are you going to do with me? You're here until Daddy pays. You better pray he does. Sunday will be too late. What do you mean Sunday will be too late? Come here. Leave it. She"s lying, the bitch. Yaki, it's okay. I'll take care of her when youre in the army. Why not? I'll give her food and text you what"s going on. We went over this. You cant handle the deal alone. So we just stop everything now? Her father will call. Shes bullshitting us. We'll keep guarding in shifts, like we said. Text if there"s news. You little shit, stop throwing stones! Can"t you see youre hurting her? Did I ask you? Say what? I'll break your neck, you little shit! You understand me? You little shit! What are you doing? Let me go! Come on, come on! Youre afraid, you loser! Get off me! - Ill break your neck, you faggot! What are you doing with the bills? Leave it. I have to sort things out for the meeting about the apartment on Monday. '"Bring her a change of clothes. She pissed herself." Here, change your clothes. I can't get dressed if I cant see. Where can I change? - Here. I have to put the blindfold back on you. What will you do to me on Sunday? I want to know. If you take me home, l"ll get you the money. I'll tell my dad I got into trouble. I'll get the money. I swear. Please, I swear. I'll get you the money. L"ll talk to my dad... "She says she's getting bitten by mosquitoes. What do I do?"' "Let her scratch" 'So should I untie her hands?" What are you doing? I'm hungry. - Shut up, this isn"t high society here. Wait, what? How many gigabytes in this iPod? How many gigabytes in this iPod? Thirty-two. That"s the shit you listen to? I like it. How much did it cost? I asked how much it cost. I don"t know, it was a gift. Well, lm confiscating it. His name is Yaki. Whats yours? His name isn"t Yaki. So he just jumps down your throat when you call him that? I'm about a minute away from confiscating your life. You can't do anything. He decides. You"re wrong again, so just shut up. Why did you give 100 shekels to your boyfriend on the bike? He's not my boyfriend. - Answer the question. You wouldn"t understand. Youre too young. Hear that? That's what it's gonna sound like when I smash your face. Is it good? - Yeah. You have 5 minutes before I cover your mouth. Where you going? Go on home. I'll keep watch. Dad, are you okay? Whats going on with you? Can I have one? Never mind, it's okay... - No, no, it"s okay. Take one. You cant sleep, huh? I had a few drinks. We"ll be all right with the money. Everything"ll be all right. Yeah, I... I have something in mind too. The world is shit. It"s all about money. Without money, you're nothing. Stop it, Dad. Let them go fuck themselves. Are you thirsty? - Yeah. The rice was good. Homemade, like we eat for Sabbath dinner. Ready for me to put on the cloth? Can I have some more water first? You're the one who followed me, right? You followed me on my way home from school. No, it wasn"t me. I smelled cigarettes before. Can I have one? Give me a second. Thanks for the food. You sure you don't want to wait till Saturday night? Yeah, give me Grandpas money. Cooper! - What"s up? Green doesn"t suit you. Where are you going? To a friend of Yaki's. - Whatever, man. Just fill the tank up when you bring it back. What? - You heard me. You going to get drugs? - No, you fuck, we"re going to see friends! What? Don't talk to me like that, I ain"t your brother. I don't have to do you any favors. You know what? I won't. Hezi, stop. We were joking. Your brother's a dog, he doesnt know how to do business. I want him to apologize, now. - He"s sorry. No, I want him to say it. Come on, say it. Come on, tell him youre sorry. I'm sorry. - I didnt hear you. Im sorry. You got scared, huh? Not really. - Yeah, right. That dwarf plays the gangster. Get her stuff. You're putting on your clothes now. Stay still! Stay still! Whats going on? Shaul and I are looking for a ball to take to my units picnic. Since when are there balls in the shelter? I saw one in there once. But it's filthy down there, stay out of there. We barely got a chance to see each other. I'll get lots of long weekends off, Dad. No, long weekends are a rare thing. Yaki, come on, it's a long way. There won"t be any food left. Go. Bye, Shauli, have fun. She gave us the right number. What the fuck? "400-shekel limit on this card" Wait here. Why can"t I withdraw more than 400 shekels on your card? I don"t know. Think. Maybe because its a youth card. What did she say? - It"s a youth card. Let"s take out 400 a few times. Sons of bitches. Whats the number again? 82-10. Withdrawal denied' Just because we let you out doesn"t mean you"re free, get it? You owe us your useless life. I bet you think you're smart. You think we"re suckers that will take your shitty 400 and forget? Well, you're wrong. You"re gonna pay for this mess. It's your fucking fault, understand? You're gonna keep your mouth shut. We werent kidding. We'll haunt you and your family forever if you don"t shut up. I'll smash your face, I'll hurt you. You"ll beg me to kill you. Don't test me. Keep quiet, and maybe you"ll live a few more years. Spoiled bitch. When I tell you, start walking, straight ahead. Slowly. Step by step. When you get to 100, you can open your eyes and sprint home. I want you to understand, screw up and III shoot you. Turn around and I'll shoot you. One false move, you"re dead. Got it? One... Two... Three... Six, seven... Eleven, twelve... What was that? Did she see you? Lts late now, isnt it? Where"s Yaki? He left this morning at 5:00. Why didnt you wake me? You didn"t ask me to. I didn't say goodbye to him. You knew he was leaving early, you could"ve got up yourself. I didn't say goodbye to him. What's with you? Hell be back in two weeks. Well, I have to go. You leaving too? - Yeah. Hey. - Were you at my parents? - Yeah. Good night. Hi, honey. - Hi. Everything all right? - Yeah. - Yeah. Weren"t you supposed to meet Uri tomorrow? You saw him downstairs? - What did he want? To settle things... ...about the apartment. Where are you going? We need to go over this. - L"m not going anywhere. Write down all the details. For the lawyer... - Why do you need a lawyer? Fire. Cease fire. Lock. Cooper. Get up. Get up. Yaki Cooper? You must realize that something bad has happened. Listen, Yaki, your father... hurt himself last night. I'm sorry to break this terrible news to you, but I want you to know, the whole unit is with you, we share your grief. You're going home today to your mother and brother. You need to be with them. Yaki, are you okay? Let me go! Stop it! Let me go! I'll get some refreshments. - Next to the microwave. Here. Ill get the door. Thanks for coming, Uri. I want you to know, it'll be all right. Leave it, sweetie. L"ll take it down later. Its okay. Take care of yourselves. - You too.
