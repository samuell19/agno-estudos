Dear Santa, I have been a very good boy this year except for maybe once, but that wasn't really my fault and I did say sorry. So, for Christmas, I want a remote-controlled flying bug, but a nice one that won't scare my sister, or I'll be in trouble. You can bring her whatever you want. She can't talk yet, so even if she doesn't like it, she won't say anything. But for me, please don't forget, a remote-controlled flying bug that isn't too scary. Thanks, Santa. You're the best. Well, hello, Tim Tim. Our little postman's always on time. Thank you, Mrs. Claus. Careful, it's hot. Blow on it a bit. Here's the mail for today. Could I please just take a little peek? Tim Tim, children are not allowed inside Santa's workshop. Wait! I just saw a kid in there! Nonsense. That was an elf. - Definitely an elf. - Huh? Here, have another cookie. Bye-bye. Ugh. Rufus! Hey! Wow. This is awesome. Santa! Santa? What are you doing? Just getting ready to go. Ho-ho-ho! Huh? Have you completely forgotten? Quite possibly. What? We are going somewhere-- by airplane, remember? Retirement? Pacific cruise? Ah! Yes, our sea cruise. Sea, surf and sun-- our new life. Hmm? Hey! What's going on? We heard the launchpad. Who hitched up the sled? It's not Christmas yet! Sorry, Humphrey. False alarm. Old habits die hard. It's going to take me a while to, uh, get used to no longer being Santa. Well, if it makes you feel any better, it's going to take me a while to get used to being Santa. Oh, come on, you're amazing. All the incredible toys you've invented this year, they're all fantastic! - I love this one! - Oh, yes! This is a good one! I wish I'd have come up with it. - Want a game? - What? Now? Ah! Come over here! Come over here! Oh! Over here! Over here! We've got a plane to catch, remember? Oh! Of course, dear. So, then, this really is good-bye? Yes, but I can't leave without doing the most important thing of all. Oh. How do I look? Hmm. Not bad. Not bad at all. Well, it's official. You are Santa Claus from now on. What if I'm not cut out for it? What are you talking about? You've been chosen by the Christmas Spirit to take my place. Besides, you're not alone. Humphrey's here to help you out. And Waldorf. - And Beatrice. - Mmm. And never forget, you've got a lot of elves. Good-bye, everyone. We've had some great times. I'm leaving you all in Nicholas's capable hands. Thanks to him, I can go with my mind at ease. Come on, Beatrice, we've got a plane to catch. Um... isn't that the closet? Just give him a moment. I really need a break, don't I? Bye, Santa. Bye, Santa. Right. And now it's up to you. Come on, everyone. Cheer up. Santa's gone, but we've got a new Santa. And everything's going to run just as smoothly as it did before. Right? Whoa! A kid! Huh? Huh? You're the new Santa? - Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh! - And you're a kid. You're not supposed to be in here. Santa's rules. No kids allowed. But you're a kid. I know, I know! And she's a kid, too. I know! Ow! Will you all just knock it off! I-I didn't mean to shout. I-I... I never shout. Sorry. Come on, everybody out. Nothing to see here. - I'm Beatrice. - Tim Tim. Hey, could I stay here for a little while and play with some toys? Wait! I have to show you the lab. The what? Come on! Hey! I didn't say that you... Check it out. Wow! Well, you must want to play all the time. We do, but here, play is work and work is play. That's how we test all the toys that Santa invents. It's all just so much fun. Cool! It's incredible. Whoa, what is that? - Tim Tim. - Whoa! Time for you to go. There's the door. Nicholas, don't you want to play with us? I'd love to, but... you know, I've got responsibilities now. What's that-- "responsibility"? That's a grown-up thing. "A not too scary remote-control flying bug." Okay. Whoa. Mom, Dad. If only you were here with me now. Pardon me, sir, there's a problem with the... Oh! Okay, it can wait. Oh! Can you believe it? In just a few hours, we'll actually be there. If we don't crash first. Oh, come now, Santa. It's just air pockets. You've had much worse on your sleigh. Maybe so, but I was the one in the driving seat. Here, I can't control a... Oh, come now. It's time to stop the magic. This is our chance to live a normal life. Wh-What if I'm not cut out for it? Of course you are. You'll see. Hmm? Rufus! Huh? Hmm. Okay, Humphrey. What do you think? We got a kid who wants a remote-control bug, but nothing too scary. A bee? It's sweet. Everyone likes bees. Bees make honey. My thought exactly. Okay. Here it comes. Ow! Make it stop! What do you think I'm trying to do? Aw. Wow! Awesome! The kid! That's enough! What is he still doing here? What did I tell you earlier? Go and play in your roo... Sorry. Go to your room! - What's going on? - Oh... Uh, that's weird. Yeah. Especially as he doesn't have a room here. You invented a toy that spits fire? No! That's not what I was trying to do. I... Maybe I can help you. No. No, out of the question. Don't you understand? You're in the way. This is my first Christmas, and I don't want to let Santa down and... But you're Santa. I said go away! Come on, Tim Tim. Wait. I didn't mean it. Calm down, Nicholas. All new Santas have these kind of problems at first. Do they? No, I was just saying that to cheer you up. He's not normally like that. Nicholas is a great friend and fun. And he's a wonderful Santa, but something's wrong. Maybe you should phone the old Santa Claus. Oh, no, I wouldn't want to worry him. They've probably just got to their new house. Besides, we've got a lot of elves. That's for sure. And they're really funny, too. "Aah! There's a kid in the room!" Bye-bye. Bye-bye. What are you worried about? Nothing. Well... something. I'm worried about Christmas. Really? Is it an emergency? Oh, say it's an emergency. Go on. Whoa! I didn't say it was an emergency. Here we go. It's right up here. "For emergencies only." I don't know, Waldorf. They keep it out of reach for a reason. - Nicholas has problems, right? - Yeah. And you don't know how to solve them, right? Uh-uh. And you're really clever. So if you can't fix it, then it must be an emergency. Huh? Whoa. Oh! Oh! Whoa! I think you've gained a few extra pounds. - It looks good on you. - What? I didn't hear that. I know it was insulting, but it probably was funny. At least let me take off the jacket. Oh, come on, now, we're almost there. - Where? - I told you, it's a surprise. You like surprises, don't you? Stop your bellyaching. We're here now. - Where? - Here. Huh? The orphanage. The one where we found Nicholas. This is a delightful surprise, but why the suit? Hello! Daffodil Orphanage. Can we help you? Uh, Mr. Santana here to see Mr. Ratchet. Huh? Well, they need someone to run the orphanage. You aren't really going to spend your retirement twiddling your thumbs, are you? Being surrounded by children, playing with them, - I thought... - Beatrice! Oh! You clever little sugarplum. Oh, this is just wonderful! Oh, Santa. Oh, come on. Come in. Eh... oh. So, we'll make this quick, shall we? Okay. In a nutshell, I retire in six months. I'm looking for someone to replace me as director of this orphanage. Would you say you're very familiar with children? Oh, yes, that's fair to say. I know all the children in the whole world. Don't touch that! Oh... - You know, I'm a bit like them. - What? I never miss any opportunity to play. In an instant, you're a frog leaping on lily leaves. Or a knight, attacking an impenetrable fortress. Or a pirate. Arr! On a quest for treasure. I'm swinging from vine to vine. Look out! Dinosaurs. The green diamond. I'll take it to a desert island aboard my ship. I said don't touch that! The Daffodil Orphanage does not need another child. Good day, sir! Oh, Santa, I'm sure we can find something else. - It was just an idea, and there are - Hmm? so many other things you can do with your life. Oh! Mother of mistletoe! Beatrice, dear, I'll be right back. He forgot his... I wonder what Santa would do. You rang? Santa! You're back? A little bird told me you might need some help. Really? Everything's fine. - What's that? - Ow! Oh, dear. That is strange. It was years before I had a real whisker on my chin. Yes, it keeps growing back, and there's a silly toy I can't get right. And there's millions and trillions of other problems everywhere, and tonight's Christmas Eve, and I'll never be ready in time. Never, never, never! Huh? All right. So you do need some help. Uh, have you looked in the basement? We have a basement? I knew there was something I forgot to show you. What? The Spirit of Christmas. Oh, thank goodness. It's okay. For a moment there, I thought that perhaps... It's melting? It's not supposed to melt, is it? - This is serious. - Rather serious. - More like "extremely." - Well, one word: disaster. - What? - Huh? Coming through! Ah, Santa! There you are at last, dear friend. We were all wondering where you'd gone. Now we're all together at last. You're all Santa? Oh, well, we were. But what are you all doing here? Someone sounded the emergency bell. - Did you... - I did. I'm sorry. I didn't know what else to do. You're just not yourself. Tell old Santa your troubles, my boy. Well, I keep growing whiskers, and I'm annoyed all the time. Oh, and I'm craving coffee. And that's really weird because I've never even tasted coffee. - Hmm. - What is it? I'm afraid that you've got grown-up-itis. It's a very rare illness in children who want to grow up too fast. - Is that bad? - No. Not very. Except when a Santa Claus is stricken with it. I knew it. This is all my fault. There's only one thing to do. Panic! Okay! No! One of us needs to stand in for him until he gets better. - Let's pick one. - Okay. Ready? Rock, paper, scissors! Paper covers rock! - Uh, scissors covers... - I don't believe that's... You, sir, could you stand in for Nicholas? Me? Is she joking? Well, you can count on me. I'll take care of all the deliveries. What? Hang on one moment, young man! Who do you think you are? You can't stay here anymore. You might be contagious. - But... - He's right. You can come back when you're well again. I'll take care of the young'un. And I'll save Christmas. May I? Hmm. Not a moment to lose. Let's get to work. Oh! Come on. Trust me. I'll have you fixed up in no time. Pfft. I don't really feel like racing sleds right now. READY? Set? Go! First! I win! Best of three? Huh? Frankly, I don't see how this is supposed to make me feel better. Christmas crackers. It's worse than I thought. What happened? I ran into a door. A door? - Where? - Can't you see it? Right there in... There's a bunch of them. I-I don't see anything. They look like doors on an... - Advent calendar! - Advent calendar! That's why you're the only one who can see it. Each Santa Claus has his own personal Advent calendar, which appears to him in times of trouble. Each numbered door is connected to a year of your life, past and future. Which door is that? Twenty-four. Okay, it's like a puzzle, and it chooses where it wants you to start. Which, in your case, is door 24. Now, when you get to the other side, keep your eyes open and look for clues, things that will tell you which doors to open next. And behind one of these doors, you'll find the answer to your problem. Okay. Got it. Well, I've got a toy he's sure to like. What do you think of this? - Adorable! - Yes, but will he like it? That's another story. Here he comes. Rufus! Shh. All right, let's make this quick. I got another meeting at 7:00. - All right, so where are we? - Well, Mr. Nicholas, we have this doll that has always - been a big hit. - Nicholas? Hey, that's me. She can say "mama," and she can drink - from a bottle. - What else? Uh, she wets her diaper and... I said, "What else?" Uh, we have this really cute little plush toy hamster. Look how funny he is. What else? Rufus, no. Right. Now, listen. For years, people have had it all wrong about children. But not me. I know exactly how they feel deep down. Do you know how long it takes to become a grown-up? Too long. Ask a seven-year-old what he really wants. - A soccer ball! - Who said that? Get out. Poor guy. That was uncalled for. What every 7-year-old wants is to stop wasting time on stupid toys. They want to grow up faster. And I intend to help that seven-year-old grow up. You know how? By taking away this distraction of Christmas. From now on, no more presents, no more Christmas. What? He can't do that, can he? Thanks to me, children will stop playing for good. They can become grown-ups much faster. And the elves? Fired. I always thought there were - too many of them anyway. - Excuse me? 7:00. This meeting is over. What was that? Was he... was he hiding under the table? Huh? Hmm. Future not so bright? When I grow up, I'm gonna be a big jerk. And mean, too. Come on, now. No, you won't. The future isn't set in stone, you know. There's still time to change everything, Nicholas. Believe me, this is only the first stage of the game. You can still win overall. Did you find a clue, something to tell you where to go next? Hmm. The number seven came up a lot. Interesting. You're seven now. That means door number seven is the present. Hmm. I'm curious to know what it opens into. So am I. Hmm. This contraption is ridiculously complicated. What do you call it again? Oh, it's a video game console. Nicholas makes really great ones. Ah, yes, I've seen these computer things. They cause children to stay indoors, sitting all alone, staring blankly at a screen. Well, they can still be a lot of fun. There are all kinds of different games. If you push the button here, the screen... Pushing buttons, did you say? That doesn't stretch the imagination very far, does it? Ah. Things were very different when I was Santa Claus. There was no TV, no radio, no Internet. Just time to play. Ha, good times. Ah, yes. Hmm. Huh? Wha... How did you do that? I-Is this your house? Yeah. Mom, this is Nicholas. I've been expecting you. - Huh? - My mom can see the future. Really? You came just in time. I was about to bring you my letter. You know, I'm not Santa Claus anymore. I caught some sort of strange disease. Huh? You mean there won't be any presents this year? - Well... - Sit. Huh? Ow! Funny. That looks like you, but younger. And he reminds me of... My teddy bear! That was my teddy bear at the orphanage - when I was little. - Huh? But I forgot to take him with me when Santa Claus came to get me. Shh. The spirits are speaking. They say, in order to be cured, Nicholas must find the bear. My teddy bear. Oh, yeah. I know it. It's a mountain in the shape of a bear. The spirits are showing you the path. It is the path of healing. Door number three. Nicholas, I'm going with you! No, Tim Tim, he must go alone. I can never go anywhere. What talent. Excuse me, sir. Can I help? Oh, yes. Why not, indeed? Could you take those away, please? Huh? Was there something wrong with them? No. I just don't think the children will like them. There. Uh, nice. You've made a boat. Ah, a pirate ship! We used to make loads of these. He isn't gonna give that to a kid, is he? Of course I am. Children like simple things. Half a walnut shell, a stick and some paper, then you can pretend that you're Blackbeard the pirate. Hours of fun in the tub, days even. Kids don't want to do that. They will now. You got to be kidding me. I heard that. Completely nuts. Well, the boat's cute, but we've got a list, right? And we can't give every kid the same thing. Huh? Yes, we can! But I'm going to give every child the same thing for Christmas, and they are going to like it. I'm a genius, and I'm going to save Christmas. How silly. I should have thought of that sooner. Oh, yes, I remember him well. That teddy bear was the first toy I gave you when you were a baby. Of course that's the cure. My teddy bear? - Why? - Because a child's 1st toy is magical. Just take a look at mine. I take my little blue bunny with me wherever I go. Whenever I don't feel good, I just give him a hug and... He should be... Oh, no. I've lost my bunny. My bunny wabbit. Where are you going? Bear Mountain is that way. Door number one is here. Yeah. So? Oh. When I was one, my parents were still here. Do you think I could... No, Nicholas! Listen! That's not a good idea at all! This game has rules you have to... follow. Hey, buddy, you want a photo with Mom and Dad? What a cutie. What's the little fellow's name? Nicholas. Move in a little to the left. Give us a smile. Great, great. Hold it. One, two... Mom? Dad? No! No! No! I ruined the game. Don't worry. There's still hope yet. Can't you just leave me alone? Oh! I'm sorry. Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to say that, Santa. It's just because of... My mom can see the future. It is the path of healing. Door number three! Maybe door number three still works. There's still hope. Huh? Where are you going? I saw myself entering it in the magic smoke. - Uh, let's go, then. - No. Uh, I have to go alone. You know how dangerous it is there? Don't worry, Santa. This time, I'll follow the rules. In the meantime, you should go and look for your bunny rabbit. But what are you making? You tell me. Bricks? Come now, Beatrice, use your imagination. A building? A train? Yes. Or a car. Vroom! Rocket ship! Zoom! With two of them, you could have a puppet show. "Hello." "Hello." "How do you do?" "I'm fine, thank you." Don't you see? Brothers and sisters will be playing together for the first time in years. And best of all, they're easy to make. We should have one for every child on the planet in... just a few hours. We can't do this. Oh, I think we can. I'm saving Christmas, and nothing can stand in my way. Oh, yeah? Yeah. Can you believe that girl? It's as if she's gone mad or something. Are you still thirsty, Mrs. Rose? By any chance, have you seen my bunny? You! No use insisting, good fellow. I already told you, you're not cut out for the job. There you are! Right. You've got your dirty old stuffed toy, then? If so, would you please show yourself the door? No! This is not the way out! Don't worry, I'll get her. Deck the halls! You've got to be kidding me. Whoa! Zoey! Come back here immediately! Huh? Oh! Don't slam into the walls like that. You'll get hurt. Ooh! This looks like fun. Fun, you say? It's freezing cold here! Where are we? Good question. Oops. Don't fret. I'll get you home. Oh! Come on! Huh? I'm scared. Mr. Ratchet, try and reach the controls and raise the anchor. What? Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'm not moving an inch. But you know all about boats, don't you? - Me? - When you were a little boy, you dreamed of becoming the captain of a pirate ship. Ah. When I think of all those boats I gave you over the years... Tall ships, motorboats, all different colors. I remember the very first one. It was a plush toy tugboat. A bit unusual, but you loved it. Are you Santa Claus? Ah, well, I, uh... - Captain, take the helm. - Huh? Mmm. Whoa... Slowly... Slowly. Ahoy, sailor. Weigh anchor. Easy does it. Easy does it. Stop. Stop. I said stop! Hold on tight! Yahoo! We did it! Full steam ahead! Whoo-hoo! - Whee! - My workshop! Turn to port! To port! Turn left! I'm trying! Are we expecting a delivery? Cool! Elves! Aah! Look, it's a kid, it's a kid! Aah! Maybe you haven't noticed, but there's a big ship in the hallway over there. Good point. Huh? Santa, thank goodness you're back. Is Nicholas with you? Is he okay? Where is he? No, he's off to Bear Mountain to find his first toy. It's a long story. Things are bad here, and not just because you crashed a boat in the front door. I mean really bad. The new Santa, who's really the old Santa, the one that replaced Nicholas, who replaced you... Uh, you know what I mean-- him! I think he's gone a bit crazy. Uh, what are you talking about? I've seen the presents, and they're all the same. And he's destroying all of Nicholas's toys to make these. - Waldorf. - Hmm? Why are you unwrapping my presents? Don't you think we have enough work to do as it is? And since when are children allowed in here? Okay. Uh, clearly, we need to talk. We'll talk later after I've saved Christmas. Huh? See ya! Stop that reindeer! Come on, Rufus, we're almost there. Should I go on without you? Here we go. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Yahoo! Yeah! Whoa! Nicholas! Nicholas! Door number three. Nicholas! Something wrong? Would you like to play with me? What's his name? His name? Um... Blue Bunny. Thanks, Santa. This is the very best present ever. Uh, well, I-I mean, yes, I'm happy to lend it to you. Blue Bunny, what's the matter? He wants his mashed carrots. Ooh, yes, I think it's ready. Mmm. Want some butter? Yes, but not too much. Okay. Here it comes. Um... He loves it! I'll make pancakes for dessert. Will you help me, Beatrice? What's that light? Oh. One for Mommy. Mmm! - That's yummy, isn't it? - It's not a toy. What? I always thought it was the toys, but... the toy has nothing to do with it. It's in here. If only I could just tell Nicholas. Teddy? Huh? Teddy. Where are you, Teddy? Is something wrong? Do you want to play with me? Thank you. Who are you? Are you new here? I'm Santa Claus. You don't look like him. I promise, I'm Santa. Uh... One day, you'll see. Oh. Hi, Waldorf. Hey, Rufus. Are you okay? Never felt better. Good to see you. Huh? What was all that? I wish I knew. Come on, let's get back to the workshop. Any problems since I've been away? Uh, well... Knock, knock, here's Santa. Nicholas, you're okay! Yup. So, you found the bear? Yes. Actually, it's more like the bear found me. Anyway, would you mind if Tim Tim came to play with me at the workshop? Oh, say yes, Mom! Say yes! Please, please, please, please! Hmm. Hmm? Hmm. Christmas Spirit is strong again. I can feel it. Hey, Tim Tim, it's time to play. Having fun. Now, Waldorf! Whoa! Calm down! Silence! It's no use. I've already tried. Come on, we can't give up now. Huh? Oh...! Nicholas! Waldorf! Allow me to introduce the new Santa Claus. Really? Have you come to save us, Santa? - Hello. - Huh? Don't I get a hug? You need to step aside now. Save it for later, little Santa. When I return, we'll have a nice roast dinner with all the trimmings, and we'll catch up on old times. But until then, it's Christmastime! Well, at least we'll have a nice roast dinner. Hey, guys, don't be down. I'm sure Humphrey will save us. I doubt it. I suddenly realized, they're just bricks. What was I thinking? Well, maybe Tim Tim can. What? Hmm. It's okay. Actually, this is great. It is? Let's have some fun. Huh? Oh, it's magnificent. - Ah! - Wow. - Wow! Ride on, cowboy! Yee-haw! Hyah! Merry Christmas, everyone! Go for it! Yippee! Nice job. Turn around! Now! Nope. You had your chance. You got sick. Too bad for you. - I'm better now. - I can't hear you. La, la, la, la. I can't hear you. La, la, la, la, la. - Bricks! - Hmm. Why do people keep saying that? They're not bricks. They're toys. Very nice toys. Oh, I've had it. See for yourself. Have a volleyball. Here's a plane. - And a rocket. - No! No child wants to play with that. I happen to think they're very amusing. Please, listen to reason. The kids don't want bricks. They wrote to Santa to ask for toys that inspire them. And every letter is unique, just like them. Kids have a lot of imagination, you know. Ha! That's precisely what I've been trying to tell you all along. Look, this is a car for young Thomas. Thomas asked for a fort and a fireman's uniform. This is a teddy bear for Magalie. I made a carriage drawn by four white horses for Magalie. Stop showing off! How do you know all these children so well? That's what I'd like to know! Because I'm Santa Claus. Wait! Stop it right now! You're trying to trick me. Just admit that I won. Come on. No one likes a sore loser. All right. But it's not fair. Don't cry. I said you win. Nicholas? No! Dive! Hurry! Hurry! Nicholas! Nicholas! What have you done? I didn't mean it. Oh, no. - Poor little fellow. - Shh. He was a good boy, and he was Santa. You okay? I didn't mean him any harm. But, then, everyone was so mean to me and mocked my toy. It was an accident. I know. You didn't do it on purpose. No. Is that really you? Oh, Nicholas, can you ever forgive me? I already have, but... you're crushing me. What a magnificent toy. Are you the one who invented it? Nope. A little boy dreamed it up. And I'm going to take it to him. Amazing! Could I have one of those for Christmas? Well, we've got the Christmas Spirit back to full power. And we've got the machines reversing the bricking toys at full tilt. If we allow for wrapping, we should have everything ready in... Oh, dear. What? Uh, two hours! We'll never have time to deliver everything. Two hours? Are you worried? I'm not worried. Because, if I'm not wrong, we have a lot of elves. Ah! Yay! Wow. That's so cool. A promise is a promise. Magnificent! - Oh, wow! - I could eat a horse. - So could I. - It smells delicious. Could I come back and help Santa next year? Well, you'll have to ask him. Well, it looks like we'll have to change the rules about letting kids into the workshop. You see, Nicholas? All right, all right. But I'm sure everything will go well next year. So am I. You can finally retire and enjoy your new life in the sun with Mrs. Claus. Oops. I forgot all about Beatrice. Oh, boy. Uh... oh. Um, uh... merry Christmas? You... you! What a lovely surprise to see you again, madam. Mr. Santana here was just speaking about you. He was? I was? I mean, I was! In fact, to be honest, he hasn't stopped talking about you. - Hmm? - About your new life - and his new position. - My new position? This man is the perfect candidate to take over the orphanage. Oh? Congratulations, and merry Christmas. Oh. Merry Christmas, indeed. Oh. Care for some turkey and roast chestnuts? Hmm? I'd love some. I'm famished. Merry Christmas, Beatrice. Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas, everyone! So, we've finally decided, right? Absolutely. Paper-scissors is not a good one to choose. No, it's not. So there's only one way. - Flip a coin! - Good idea. Um, I don't have any money on me. - Do you? - No, I don't got any. - I've got some chewing gum. - Chewing gum?
