Hmm. Hmm? Mm-Hmm. Mm-Hmm. [Crying] Eh, what's up, doc? Are you sittin' on a tack or somethin'? I'm the easter rabbit, And I'm supposed to be happy and gay... [whimpers] When I deliver the eggs. But my feet are killing me. Well, I'm not doin' anything. I'll deliver the technicolor hen fruit for ya. I don't think you can do it. Don't worry, doc. I'll be ok. Well, remember, Keep smiling. Every year i get some dumb bunny to do my work for me. [Sighs] Here's the easter rabbit Hooray Making life funny Hooray Phooey. I'm glad I don't have to do this for a livin'. I am gettin' looney-Tuney, tetched in the head This whole thing is gooney, I shoulda stood in bed Well, here's the joyous bunny's first stop. Here's the easter rabbit Hooray The happy easter rabbit Here, kid, have an egg. I want an easter egg! I want an easter egg! I want an easter egg! I want-- Why, you little-- [Growling] Yeow! Cut it out, kid. Somebody'll get hurt. Probably me. Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ohh! How did I get into this mess? Now, look here, you juvenile delinquent. Oh, he broke my wittle arm! He broke my wittle arm! Ooh, the bad wabbit Broke my wittle arm! [Gunfire] But you can't quit. You'll give the easter rabbit a bad name. I already have a bad name For the easter rabbit, But I'll try once more. Remember, keep smiling. Here's the easter rabbit Hooray The happy easter rabbit Hooray I'm waiting for the easter wabbit. When he comes in, wookin' so fluffy and cute With his wittle basket of easter eggs, Bang! Easter wabbit stew. Ha ha ha! ...Looney-Tuney, tetched in the head Here he comes now. This whole thing is gooney I shoulda stood in bed Uh-Oh. Here we go again. I'm gettin' the jump on this one. Here's the easter rabbit Here's an egg for you, kid. And hold onto it real tight. I'll get that wascawy wabbit If it's the wast thing I do. I can't miss with my dick twacy hat. Hens work hard the eggs to lay Then I give them all away Crazy easter rabbit, hooray I gotcha now, wabbit. I'm gonna dwown you. Hey, come back here, wabbit! I bet you say that to all the rabbits. Ha ha ha! Oh! Temper, temper. Don't be a sorehead, doc. I'll show you a trick. I used to be in a magician's act. You've got to deliver a lot more eggs. Eh, that's not the trick, doc. Now, observe closely. The hand is quicker than the eye, doc. Nothin' in the hat, nothin' up my sleeves. I'll need a watch and a handkerchief. Now, i place the watch in the handkerchief And proceed to seemingly destroy the watch. Step back, son, I might hit your fingers. Then I place the seemingly destroyed watch Into the hat, thusly, And then a few magic words a wandering gypsy once told me By the light of a full moon, Hocus pocus alakazam, voila! The trick, she is done. Eh, another trick this guy had... [crash] Was sawing a woman in half. Ya got a saw on ya, doc? Ooh! Of course, you know this means war. Ooh... [gunfire continuing] Eh, which way did he go? Which way did he go? He went that a-Way, And don't forget your easter eggs. Ha ha! I want an easter egg. I want an easter egg. Oh, no! [Whistles] I want an easter egg. I want an easter egg... hey! Cut it out! Ooh! No! Stop it! Well, that's that. No more finagling with easter eggs. Oh, here's an easter egg That crazy rabbit forgot to deliver. If you want anything done, You have to do it yourself. Things like this just make me go all to pieces. It's the suspense that gets me. [Explosion] Remember, doc, Keep smiling! Ha ha ha! [Instrumental music]
