[crowd groans] - Hey, what are you gonna do? Hey, we move past this one. You girls played hard today. Keep your heads up, okay? We're gonna move on to the next game. Agent Allen? - What's up, you coaching now? - No, just helping out a friend. - Oh, man, well you know I'm gonna get you back on the field, right? I mean, I got a friend, he's a therapist. Gonna work some magic. - Good, you know that's what I want. - Yeah, yeah. Hey, if baseball doesn't work out, I don't know, maybe there's a future for you in this coaching thing. - No, no, no, no. Don't even talk like that, no. - It's good to see you, man. - You too, bro. - Well, hey, I gotta go. I'll talk to you later and hey, stay healthy, okay? - That's the plan. - Don't quit your day job just yet. Good game if you like losing. - Hey coach. - It's Kenzie. - I want a rematch. - You don't deserve one. You're gonna have to step up to the plate and do better than this. Haven't you had enough humiliation for one day? - That was left handed. - I could strike you out on either side, so. - Well, I have Benji here that says you can't. - I don't need your money, but since you're scared to kiss me, what if we wager a kiss instead? Are you ready for your pact to be broken? - Give me your best pitch, cupcake. - Don't call me cupcake.

All right, well, why are you running out of a church in a wedding dress with no groom? - Just drive and stop asking questions. - [Chase] Okay, runaway bride but why are you-- - I'm not running away. - Okay, why are you leaving the church in a panic? - You're a nosy Uber driver. If you need to know, I went to the wrong church. - Okay, first of all, I'm an Uber driver. - Okay, okay, can you take me to-- - Okay, hold on, fluff-n-stuff, okay? You're sitting there telling me that you went to the wrong church on your wedding day? - You don't believe me, do you? Fine, I'll hitch a ride. - Okay, dressed like that? Come on, just get back in the car, okay? Look, you can't be out here in a wedding dress hitchhiking. It's not safe. [Tiffany groans] Okay, I believe you. - No, you don't. You're just saying that so I'll get back in your car. - No, I'd really feel guilty leaving you out here shoeless. - I don't ride with strangers. - You were just in my car. Look, do I look like-- - I'm not riding with someone who doesn't believe me. - Okay, I believe you. - Not convinced. - I believe you. - Still not. - I believe. Look, I can't in good conscience have you out here dressed like you are-- - I'll be fine. - With no shoe all by yourself. - Okay, fine, I'll make an exception this once. [soft gentle music] Did you know this dress symbolizes innocence, goodness, and purity? Yup, it's also the color of perfection. - Whatever you say, fluff-n-stuff. - Stop calling me that. - [Chase] Look... - Thanks for the sandwiches. - My treat. I mean, I was getting a little hangry myself. [Tiffany giggles] Oh, you got something right there. Look, we can't keep driving all night trying to find this church that you're supposed to get married at. Look, I'm sorry about all this. - Don't think I need some handsome man to come rescue me from the dumps because you are mistaken. Who runs out on their wedding? - Someone who knows what they want. - Okay, don't assume I was getting married. I could've been having my pictures taken or a bridal fitting. - Oh, yeah, right. You know but the whole, take me to another church. You know, the panic, I mean, you sold it. [Tiffany laughs] [Tiffany sighs] Look, whoever it was is one lucky guy. [Tiffany softly sobs] - [Tiffany] It's been a long day. [Tyler moans] - Wait, I told you no hitting. Visualize the healing taking place. Look, I know this is hard for you. You wanna be back in the game playing, but I need you to trust me. - You're not my first therapist. - I'll get you back in the game, okay? Look, I know my methods are little unorthodox. I need you to start visualizing the healing. See yourself getting better, okay? All right, keep your head up. Call me if you need anything. [Tyler sighs] - Worshiping at the church of baseball? How's your shoulder doing? - It's fine. It's my heart that's aching. - I've been there. - Why me? - You know, I'm asking myself the same thing. Why me? Look, like my father always says, grief is not a sign of weakness. It's the price you pay for love. - Wow, that's profound. - Thank you. Nah, just words of wisdom for you. How's your family doing? - Good. - Talk to your sister lately? Look, I have the best baseball joke for you. Which baseball player makes the best pancakes? The batter. Right, you get it? Nailed it! - [Tyler] Ah, man. - [Brandon] Hey, who was that girl? - [Tyler] You interested in her? - [Brandon] No, I don't need anymore girl problems. - [Tyler] She's not your type, bro. She's a little on the weird side. - [gasps] Hi, Olive. Hi sweet girl, how are you? - What's her name? - Olive, she's my aunt's dog. [Tiffany sighs] - Wow, this place is amazing. - Thanks. Yeah, it's my family's vacation home. My Aunt Sally needed a place to crash, but she's gone for a couple weeks, so. Hey, thanks again for everything. Now you don't have to put up with me anymore. - Yeah, like you're a real pain. - [laughs] You have no idea. - You're okay? - Yeah, but boy, am I ready to get out of this dress. I can see why. - I should get going anyway. - Yeah, yeah. Thanks again. - Absolutely. - [Tiffany] Okay. - Have a good night. - [Tiffany] Bye. [soft gentle music] [Tiffany sighs] [Tiffany softly sobs] - What are you still doing here? - Just working on the pointers you're giving me. Coach. - What are you doing here? - Here to give you a batting lesson. - [Tyler] In a girly sport or... - So you think 'cause you just played in the minors-- - Ah, in the majors. - Till they cut you. - They didn't cut me. I'm rehabbing my shoulder. - Oh, you don't have to do that for me. You really need all the practice you can get. - Well, what are you doing here then? - Not here for you, I'm here for your star pitcher. So, couldn't make it into the majors, so you're coaching now? [Tyler laughs] - No, actually I'm helping out a friend who's having knee surgery done. - All right, Chelse, let's go. - Look, Kenzie, wait. - I did. So, hot shot, looks like we have some unfinished business. - Have you forgotten what happened last time? - I think you're still afraid to kiss me. [playful music] - Coach, don't be too cocky. - You just make the right call, okay? No favoritism. - You ready, Tyler? - Give me your best pitch, cupcake. - Don't call me cupcake. - Wait, wait, wait. You trying to kill me? - Just making sure you're awake. Strike! - I mean, it's a little low, but it is in the zone. Strike. Ball. - What's wrong, hot shot? You can't handle the heat? - [Chelsie] And that's strike three, Coach. Sorry, but you're out of it. - What do you think the majors would say if they found out that you were beaten by a girl in a girly sport? - Hey, you ready to go? You two have history? - I struck out with her, too. - Some of us strike out and it's over. You seem to get as many strikes as you want. When was the last thing you got rejected by a woman? - Like, 30 seconds ago. - Oh, whatever. She's pitching you some love. - You like him. - We didn't exactly end on good terms. - I didn't pick up on that by the way she was flirting with you. - Okay, she's a nice guy, but I don't, like... - A nice guy you nearly married. - Okay, well. - She was not flirting with me. - I was not flirting with him. Okay, just a little bit. - She hates me. - Look, I don't like him. - Man, it's like I have this dark cloud over me. - He owes me an apology and a kiss. - Okay. - Mm-hm. - I have so much regret that it's haunting me.

Like I know this is gonna sound crazy, but this little old lady comes up to me while I'm meditating and prayers. Creepy, right? And she asks me, she's like, hey, do you know who this belongs to? - Okay, so how did this lady know? Okay, this is weird, hang on. Some old lady in a church. - Yup. - Winds up with my sister's stuff. Should I be concerned here? I mean, is she okay? I mean, is she in any kind of trouble? [Tyler chuckles] - I don't know. - Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah. - Where you going? - [Tyler] I forgot. - Nope, yeah, no. No, definitely not. [Tiffany sighs] Wait a second. Perfect. Oh, come on. [knocking] Dang it. Hi. - Hi. I think I might of left my phone in here. It's around here somewhere. - Come in. Maybe it's in here. - Yeah, it's right over here. - Would you like some water? - Sure. Yeah. [Chase gulping] - So... - [Chase] How are you? - Good. Looks like you found your phone. - Yeah, yeah. And you're still in the dress. - Yeah, hard time getting it off. - Look, if... - I'm fine. You should probably go. - Well, here's my number just in case you need a shoulder to cry on or vent to. - You're a car salesman. - Yeah. [soft gentle music] Do you love him? - I could use some time alone right now. - You got my number. - Hey, wait. I know this may seem like an awkward thing to ask, but... Nevermind. I'd really like to get out of this dress, and I'm sort of having issues unbuttoning it and I was wondering if you could help me. - Sure, yeah. - If you could just unbutton it, I can get it from there. - You sure you wanna get out of your purity dress? [Tiffany chuckles] - I'm supposed to be on my honeymoon. [door creaks] - Tiffany, what are you doing here? And who is this? Wait, why are you wearing a wedding dress? - I'm having a fitting and this is my... This is my designer. - I didn't know you were getting married. - I'm just preparing for that lucky day when the right guy shows up. So, what are you doing here? - I'm feeding the dog for Aunt Sally while she's out of town. She don't look like a designer. Aren't most of them-- - Ty! Thanks for stopping by. I already fed him so you can leave. - I should get going, it's getting late. - Yeah, it is. - Ty. - Tiff. - Go, you're being annoying. - Tiffany, you know what mom taught us about-- - Ty! - Have you been crying? Are you okay? - I'm fine. Now leave. - Tiff, remember who you are. - Leave. I know who I am. I'm a big girl now. - Do you want me to stay? - What am I doing? [knocking] - Tiffany, what's going on? Tiffany, talk to me. - [Tiffany] You should leave. - Tiffany, come on. Look, you weren't the one I was suppose to pick up at the church. - I shouldn't have walked out on him. He doesn't even know why. I am tired of being a good Christian girl that lives my life for everybody else. I messed up. I mean, who runs out on their own wedding. My family doesn't even know I was getting married. - They didn't? Maybe you weren't meant to marry this guy. It'd a bigger mistake marrying the wrong person and living a life of unhappiness. - Dude, she was in a wedding dress hanging out with some guy she said was her designer. Why would she even be getting fitted for a wedding dress? She's not dating anyone that I know of. - So what'd he look like? - Just some handsome muscly looking dude. It's no big deal. - It's probably just a phase. But hey, I gotta go. Why don't I return her stuff? - [Tyler] I can do it. - Dude, you're busy. I have nothing going on. I can save you the trip, and I'll talk some sense into her. - Oh, hey Tyler. - Text me the address. - Oh, I forgot my batting gloves. I'll be right back. - You know, the first time we met was on a baseball field. - So, you gonna teach me to bat or we just gonna keep playing catch? - Ugh, I'm still trying to decide if you're worth it. [Tyler laughs] - This is my lucky bat. I had my first home run with this. And I want you to have it. - Okay. Do I look like someone who needs a bat? - It'll bring you good luck. And you can use to ward off creepy guys. Why are you here? - Well, it's nice to see you, too. Hey. - Look, I know you hate me and you think I'm a jerk. - No, on the contrary. I am here because I believe that what we once had was wonderful. And maybe your lucky bat has enough luck in it for the both of us. - You know what I like about you. - What? - I love it when you scrunch your nose if you're nervous or uncomfortable. - I do not, no. - It's adorable, it's adorable. - Right. - What I really love about you is the purity of your heart. - That's a nice compliment. Wasn't it ah, what was it, our third, no our fourth date, where you were taking me home and we almost kissed, right? - Look, McKen-- - Oh! - Kenzie. - You were gonna say McKenzie. Yeah, no, you were. Yup. - No, no, I wasn't, no. - Okay, well, you should know my batting average with men isn't so good. - Kenzie, you stole my heart, and knocked it out of the park. - So why didn't you kiss me? Why didn't you break your silly pact? Was I not worth it, Tyler? - [Chelsie] I got 'em! [soft somber music] [door whooshing] - Oh, you scared me. Do you not believe in knocking? - I did knock, but you didn't answer. I figured you were around here somewhere. - Okay, what are you doing? - It's hot tubbing, it's not a sin. - Hang on there, Maverick. You're not really thinking of-- - Getting in? [water splashes] This feels good. - Okay, this is not good for a girl trying to do the right thing. - I never told you why I was at the church. I was suppose to meet someone there. And then you hopped into my car and... Here we are. - Here we are. - So do you wanna play 20 questions? To get to know each other. - Okay, but first, put on a shirt. You are slightly distracting. - Favorite food. - Cordon Bleu. - What's your favorite childhood memory? - Water skiing with family. - What's the most rewarding thing you've ever done? - Serving a mission. - What's the most rebellious thing you've ever done? Come on, answer it. - Probably hanging out with you. - Okay. [chuckles] - How old were you when you had your first kiss? - Chase. - Come on. - What if I don't want to? - Look, it's harmless. - Next question. - Okay, biggest regret? - Next question. - Come on, you gotta answer it. - I can't. - Come on, biggest regret. Come on, be a good sport. - Eloping. - You know, you can't keep finding up here forever. You're gonna have to eventually face him. - I just can't talk to him or my family about this right now. You are the only one who knows. - We have a secret. [Tiffany chuckles] - Well, I got some good news and some bad news. Good news is I can get you into a facility where we can spend up your rehab. - Well, that's great. What's the bad? - Well because your injuries have been over 60 days, you've been put on the disabled list. - Wait, what? - Well, when you get called up from the majors to play in a few games like you did, they have the option to retire you based on the severity of the injury. Many times they don't call you back to play unless you're one of their star players. - So, are you saying my career's over? - No, no, no, let's not overreact here. Let's just trust in the man upstairs, see how this plays out, okay? Look, I'll see what I can do. In the meantime, you get healthy and I'll stay in touch. - Thanks, buddy. - Ty, you played in the majors. That's awesome, you must be pretty good. - Yeah, well, this injury could be the end of my career. - You make it seem like it's the end of the world. If it weren't for this injury, you wouldn't be our coach. You once told us that we should never give up. - You're right. - I've never seen my sister this happy around any guy she's ever dated. - Chels, you ready? I hope you guys are practicing hard. You're gonna need it. Oh, and you still owe me for striking you out. - Well, we could just do it right here in front of the team. - Whoa. Oh, sorry, I don't kiss guys who don't brushed their teeth, haven't showered, and aren't committed to me. If, if I'm going to kiss you, I want it to be special. - Well, we can make it special right here in front of the whole team. Maybe they can learn some pointers. So your sister tells me that you're gonna scrimmage us again. - I'd like a rematch. - McKen-- - McKenzie, get it right. Everyone always confuses me with my older sister, McKinlee. Why my parents named me McKenzie, I don't know. - [Tyler] Wait, McKinlee? - Do you know her? Oh, doubt it, right. You never met my family, so you.. Okay, that inning's over. I'm just gonna try and forget about it. [Tyler sighs] - [Tyler] She'll never forgive me for what I did to her. - Can I ask, what happened? - This is amazing. How'd you manage to get into this place? - I have my connections. - No one's ever done anything like this for me before. - You look fabulous tonight. Tonight is about us. I wanna live the rest of my life with you by my side. Kenzie, I got this custom made glove made just for you. I wanna hit a home run with you in the most important game. I want you by my side as my teammate. [phone buzzes] - Are you okay? Is your hand suck in your pocket? - It seems to be. It's my agent. Can you give me just a sec? [soft somber music] - Tyler, you can't keep blaming yourself for it. - If I'm ever gonna win her back, I'm gonna have to give up baseball. - If she loves you, she'll support you in your dreams. - Please, God, take this from me. - After my divorce, I was mad at God, you, my ex. And I didn't wanna own up to it, but I became really cynical towards love. But we choose our own happiness. I wanna be happy again. Tyler, you made me happy. What do you want? Hello? Are you okay? - No, Heather, sit down. I mean, Kenzie. - Heather? - I met her after we... She passed over, over a year ago. She was in an accident. Hit by a drunk driver. I was too lazy to get out of bed to go pick her up. And... - I am so sorry, Tyler. She must've meant a lot to you. - I am so glad you're back in my life. - All right, watch and learn. [Kenzie spits] That's how they do in the majors, right? Come on, dude. Watch out. Overhand, what? Come at me, come at me, bro. - You wanna see how they do in the majors? - Oh yeah. - You wanna see? - Let's do it, anytime. You wanna go? [Kenzie playfully screams] Oh my gosh, Tyler, no. No, I can't, yes. [laughing] I get the lucky hat. I still get the hat though. - Only temporarily. - Oh, okay. Hey. We all got trials. - Yeah, I'm really trying to move on from Heather. I just wanna try and be normal again, you know? - I'd like that. You gotta let God take it from you. You can't carry it. [Kenzie laughs] It's a little big on me. - You gotta grow into it. - Oh okay. - [Kenzie] A little big though. - Just tie it up, you gotta grow into it. - Will I get into the majors? ♪ The easiest way to say it is just the truth ♪ ♪ 'Cause I've been missing you, you ♪ - I think I love her. ♪ Missing you ♪ - And I don't know what to do right now. ♪ Missing you ♪ - This injury could be the end of my baseball career. - Have you ever thought maybe it's God's way of helping you see what's most important? - Baseball is my life, and now it's being taken from me. - I know what that feels like. - Kenzie, I'm sorry. I hurt you, and maybe I deserved losing Heather to feel the pain that I caused you. - Look, I'm not a perfect Christian either. I still need to forgive seven times 70 so. I think we just both need time to heal. - [Tyler] How do you know always what to say? - [Kenzie] I read your mind. [both laughing] It's telepathy right. - [Tyler] It wouldn't be the first time. Is that your trick, is that your little trick that you did there? - Shh. - [Tyler] I know it's a secret. [soft dramatic music] [tires screeching] - [Heather] And somewhere in the mix of all of this, I really feel in love with you. - Heather? - Tyler. - Heather? - Tyler. Hi. - Oh, your visualization techniques must've caused me to dose off. - Yeah, maybe I'm working you too hard. Let's call it a night, okay? Sit tight and I'll grab you a bottle of water. - Hey. I brought you your lucky bat. I thought you might be able to use it. You know, with the way you're hitting. - [Tyler] Yup. [Tyler groans] - You gotta shape up, dude. It looks like the pitching machine just struck you out. - [Tyler] Well, why don't you come in here and give me a lesson for old time's sake? - Are you teachable? Let's see how teachable you are. I have just the lesson for you. Okay, so. It's how you hold the bat. Not how you would hold a woman. [both laughing] And first, you are going to take your front foot and step forward like so. Then you explode with your back hip towards the ball. And then your hands burst forward with the knob to the ball. Next, you make contact with the ball. And one of the most important things to remember is follow through. Always, you always follow through with your commitments. [Tyler laughs] - That was above the belt. - I'm sorry, I couldn't resist. I should go. Practice up. Tyler, do you still, do you still love me? - [Amanda] No, he loves me. I'm kidding. - [Kenzie] Do you two know each other? - Hi, I'm Amanda. - She's my therapist. This is Kenzie. - His ex, he dumped me for baseball. Can you believe it? - So, how's the shoulder doing? - It's good. - Yeah, well, see you tomorrow. - You sure she isn't an old flame of yours? - Yes, she's my ticket back to the majors. - Wow. - I'm cursed. - You cursed? Right. - No, I'm cursed. My injury, Kenzie, Heather, my sister. - What doesn't kill you makes you stronger. Stand a little taller. - No, I can't believe it. - What? - I have the worst luck when it comes to women. - Oh please, don't talk to me about your problems with women. - Don't judge me. So, I'm over at D-Bat the other day rehabbing my shoulder. Kenzie drops by. Right, anyway, you know, we're having this moment when Amanda, my therapist totally interrupts it. - Are you sure she's not one of your wild ex's? You seem to have plenty of those up your sleeve. - No, I don't. - [Brandon] Oh, yeah, you do. - No, I don't. Now I'm hungry. Now I'm hungry. Yeah, let's go eat. - Let's see, there was Kami, Heather, and who was that other chick you dated. - Kami, we dated once or twice. And she's a psycho, okay? And you know, Heather, I was gonna marry Heather, so that doesn't count. - Whatever, let's go. Oh hey, since we have your sister's stuff, we should stop by and drop it off. - That's a ways away. - Oh, then let me do the honors. I'll sweet talk some sense into her after we eat 'cause Brandon wants wingees. [both laughing] [soft gentle music] [Tyler groans] She wasn't home. - We need to return it. - Well, I'm not just gonna leave her purse and phone outside the door. Let's go. [knocking] [Tiffany sighs] - No, no, no, no. - Leave, I don't wanna talk to you right now. - Tiff, just let me in. Look, whatever you're going through, I'm here to listen. - I don't want to talk to you. - Okay, I understand, all right? Believe it or not, I know I can be a jerk sometimes, but I really need some advice right now. Come on, you're squishing me like a pancake. Let me in. - No, I hate you right now. - How can you hate me? I'm your twinner, your best friend. I love you, sis. Do you remember the time that I covered for you when you broke Mom's statue? Hmm, hmm? [Tiffany sighs] I got a serious dilemma right now. - McKenzie, well Kenzie, and Heather. Yeah, okay, I know. I know, I'm cursed. - You and me both. - What's going on with your perfect life? So tell me, what's going on with you? Tell me, sis. - No, I know what you'll say. - Come on, tell me. - You'll hate me. - No, no, I won't. Is it this guy that you're with? Is he not treating you like a lady? - No, that's the problem. - [Tyler] Your so called designer. - Will you promise you won't make me feel stupid or be upset at me? [knocking] - Anything for you. - I fell in love with him, but not for the right reasons. Oh, I know. I know this all sounds so terrible. - Hey, man. Good to see you. I'm just in the middle of a, what's with the flowers? - They're comfort flowers. - Comfort flowers? - Yeah. - Ty, where'd you go? - I'm here, sis. I'm just checking the door lock to make sure it's secure. - You got her stuff, right? - Yeah. - I don't have the courage to face him right now. I know he loves me. I'm just not sure I love him the same way he loves me. [soft somber music] And I feel so awful. What do I do? Ty? Were you listening? [car rumbles] - I have an app that allows me to, the remote starts my car. Isn't that cool, right? I have some comfort flowers. [Tiffany sighs] - He wasn't listening. - Why are you so quiet? What did she say? Brandon? [phone rings] I need to know. Look, this is about brother sister trust. What did she say? Brandon? You're keeping something from me. What is it? [phone ringing] Brandon! - You better answer your phone. - Brandon, are you and my sister-- - You know, guys like you have it all. Professional baseball career, women at your fingertips. You've got the fancy car. Your life's perfect. Guys like me just finish last. - Hold on here. My baseball career could be over. As far as women are concerned, you know what happened with Heather. And Kenzie, I could be striking out with. - Stop. - No, I'm not gonna-- - No, stop, it's a red light. [tires screeching] [Brandon exhales] - What did the traffic light say to the car? - Really? - Don't look, I'm about to change. [laughs] You know that's funny. - No, it's corny. You're corny. - Just drive your fancy car. - I can't yet. It's still red thank you. Good morning, sunshine. I'm making you a smoothie to cheer you up. - Oh, no thanks, man. I'm fine. This does not need that. [Tyler laughs] - You know, Brandon, I'm sorry you're feeling the way you do, man. I think you're an amazing guy. You're smart, you're witty, you have a great career. You're making great money. I mean, look at this place, it's amazing. No, seriously, I'm jealous of you. I'm serious. Where you going? [blender whirring] [knocking] [knocking] Ooh, that's good. - Is Brandon here? - No, you just missed him. What's going on with you and Brandon? You two aren't-- - Aren't what? [Tyler chuckles] - What about this other guy, your designer? No, I'm serious, sis. You shouldn't be alone with him. - Ty, I told you the other day what was going on. Were you listening? - Sorry, I got my own problems going on right now. - Yeah, well, so do I. - Really? You're the angel of the family. Here. - Maybe I'm being selfish. [Tiffany sighs] I like him, I just... I'm not sure he's Christian material. - He's not staying over there with you, is he? - Okay, now you're really on thin ice. - What about you and Brandon? Are you two dating or... - Wow, you really didn't hear a word I said the other day, did you? I know that's the cardinal rule, don't date your brother's friends. So, how you handling the loss of Heather? - You won't guess who's back in my life. - [Tiffany] Who, Kami? - What, no. Kenzie. - [Tiffany] Kenzie? - You know McKenzie, like the one that I nearly. - Oh, yeah. Wow. - I blew it. I wanted a career more than marriage. - Yeah, that was dumb.

The food and the dancing and the atmosphere. I'm not really one to get twitter-pated and giddy over warm fuzzy feelings, but I still believe in love. I don't know why I'm giving you a second chance. - Kenzie, I'm so sorry. - It's hard to forget somethings like when you left me alone. - Okay, I was young and stupid. - And I was young and I was naive. - You said yourself, that inning's over. - I'm scared. - Don't be. - I want you to love me more than baseball and Heather. I can't compete for your love. Tyler, do you still have feelings for her? You almost got married and you kissed her which was way more than I ever got. You were about to propose to me, and then you had to take a stupid phone call and just walk away and leave me there without an explanation or an apology. - Kenzie, look, I wanted to. Look, I felt so horrible and embarrassed over the whole thing. Not having the ring, taking that call. I didn't think you'd ever forgive me for what I did to you. It's my biggest regret. Kenzie, Kenzie, don't leave. Please. Okay, it was painful enough to come back and not see you there. - You have that look again. - No. - I can't live in the shadow of her ghost. I need you to love me completely. All of you! - Kenz-- - Tiffany? Tiffany. - Boo! Can you catch me? Oh, oh! [Tiffany laughs] - [Chase] Are you all right? - Oh! [both laughing] I'm sorry. We barely know each other. - Keep your glove up, Brooke. - Hey, don't worry, you got this. You can get her back. I believe in you. - That's quite the pep talk. You wanna coach? [Chelsie laughs] [beeping] - Hey man. - Hey. What's this? - I love your sister. We were planning to get married. And she didn't tell you this? - Tell me what? - We eloped so that no one would know. - You eloped? - I know. I know I broke the code. - How long were you gonna keep this a secret, Brandon? - I wanted to tell you. I was just too embarrassed. - You lied to me and so did she. Dating that sister, that's not cool. Marrying her behind my back, that's treason. [knocking] I thought we had a code of honor? You don't date your friend's sister. You just don't. - Look, Tyler, I'm sorry. - You know what, Brandon, I can't even talk to you right now, man. [soft somber music] [Tyler exhales] - What are you doing here? - I have some good news. You're cleared to play. - That's great. Wow, no, that's really great. - Yeah. - Here, come in. This means I can play baseball. [Amanda laughs] [knocking] - Tyler? - Come in. What are you doing here? - Chelsie said that I could pick up her softball glove here so. - Okay, well, let me get it. - Okay, wait. I've been thinking lately, and you once said to not let the past make you bitter but better, right? And a part of me really wants to believe that love is stronger than bitterness and hate. - Kenzie, Kenzie. I don't deserve you after what I've done to you. - But it's not up to you to decide that. Look, that's probably selfish of me to ask you to give up your baseball career. I mean, it's been your life, it's been your passion, and your dream. - But dreams can change. - I just, I don't wanna come in second anymore. - I know, I know. - I still love you. - Sorry. - No, no, Kenzie. No, Kenzie, it's not what it looks like. No, Kenz-- - Hey. Look, I may have done you a favor just then. You've got a baseball career to focus on. From what I can tell, she's just holding you back. Tyler. Tyler. - You don't deserve my sister. You had your chance. - Move out of the way. - No, I don't wanna see her heart broken again. - Hey, don't worry, bro. I got you. - Ooh, you wanna hear a joke? How you tell a blonde to marry ya? You tell her she's pregnant. - Brandon, let's go. [car horn beeping] Come on. - Dude, aren't you going after her? - No. Let's go make things right between you and my sister. [soft gentle music] Mustard, are you kidding me? Is my duffle bag still back there? Brandon? - Oh, yeah. - Here, I'm gonna change my shirt. Hey, you can do this. - Yeah, I don't even know what I'm gonna say. - Just me you, man. Crack a joke. No, I'm serious, just talk to her. I'll wait here. - And Daniel comes out of the den unharmed. - Unharmed? - Yeah. Isn't that amazing? - Yeah, it's amazing. Tiffany, I like you. Okay, you're fun, you're beautiful, and an amazing woman. And you seem devoted to your beliefs, but how devoted are you? Look, I don't know what happened between you and this other guy you were gonna marry. We're here right now together, and I just don't see what the big deal is if... Well, if I was to spend the night here with you. Tell me it hasn't crossed your mind. - I want it to be special with someone who I am completely in love with and married to. - Why wait and look for perfect love when you can just create it? I've fallen for you. Okay, it wasn't planned, it just happened. What is your heart telling you? Look, it told you not to marry this other guy. Tiffany, I have feelings for you. - Chase, this-- - Hey, hey, hey. Where you going? Why did you elope? - Wow, why did I elope? Well, maybe it's because for so many years I have tried to be that perfect little Christian girl that makes everyone happy and I'm finally free from it. I don't care what anyone thinks. Maybe I am being selfish but you know what, Ty? It feels good. And I deserve to be happy. - Oh, he makes you happy? You've known this guy what, a week? - It's called chemistry, Ty. - Tell me, this isn't how you pictured it. - You're a hypocrite, Ty. You walked out on the girl you were suppose to marry. Yeah, you're a real hero yourself. - So why did you? - I don't know. It all happened so fast. I was scared, I panicked. - Did you think we'd never find out? - I messed up, Ty. Go ahead and judge me, your perfect sister. - I love you, sis. But this, I don't understand. - This must be the broken hearted groom. - Oh, what, you think you can just waltz in here and steal the girl that I'm suppose to marry? [dramatic music] - [Chase] You wanna mess! - Hey, back up, buddy, before I mess with that pretty face. You back up, back up. - Stop! What would Jesus do? - Well, I'm not Jesus, am I? You know, you're not worth it. Be glad I'm a non confrontational person, and believe in turning the other cheek. - Cowards hide behind their religion. - You know what, get out of here before-- - Stay out it, Ty! - Tell me there's anything inside of you that loves him. Anything? - Is he your choice? - Go talk to her, bro. - Look, I'm not the bad guy here, okay. She hopped in my car. [soft somber music] [Tiffany sobs] - Tiffany? Tiffany, you're perfect in every way. Just not for me I guess. But if being with him makes you happy, then I'm cool with it. Not that my heart won't be broken into a million tiny pieces. It already is. But I just want you to be happy. Can we at least still share our Netflix account? [Tiffany chuckles] Look, I know I may not be the man in your dreams. And we may be on different paths right now in our lives, but I hope you reconsider and give me another chance. I know that we can get through this. And if you need more time, I'll give you as much time as you need. I'll do anything. [crowd cheering] [intense music] - Dig it out, dig it out. Go, go, go! [crowd cheering] You wanna call it or go an extra inning? - Some of my players have other commitments. - Wait, what if you guys determine the extra inning? - What? - Like one of you bats and the other pitches and whoever strikes the other one out or hits a home run, then they win. - All right, fine, I'll pitch. Since we know you can't. - Wait, got your lucky bat. - You ready? Not batting lefthanded. - Strike one. What are you gonna do when she strikes you out? Ball. - You gonna pitch it? - I see you have your lucky bat. [sighs] Let's see how lucky you are. - Strike two. - Fighting off the pitch. [players cheering] Do we need to call a medic? - Give me your best pitch, cupcake? - Ball two. - The ump sided with you. - Oh whatever, you've been framing the pitches. - She owns you right now. - Who's side are you on? [dramatic music] - Coach, are you okay? - Tyler, are you all right? Were you trying to ruin his career? Tyler, say something please. - Tyler, I am so sorry. I didn't mean to do that. Tyler, I'm sorry. - Were you trying to take him out? - It was an accident. - No, she did it on purpose. Tyler, are you gonna be okay? Can I take a look at it? Tyler, I really need to see it.

[Tiffany laughs] Does Tyler know about this? - Are you kidding me? No. [laughs] - You're doing awesome. Just remember what we talked about? When you release, you're pitching too early and it's going way over there. So it was a good height. You just need to remember, right here, right? Keep your stance. Ball go up the middle. - I came here to steal your heart again. And never lose it. I love you, Kenzie. I'm willing to give up baseball if it means having a life with you. - Really? So you're not mad at me? - No, no. I could forgive you seven times 70 and it would never get old. - Tyler, I love you, but who am I to ask you to give up your dream? - Kenzie, you are my dream. - Looks like we have some unfinished business.
