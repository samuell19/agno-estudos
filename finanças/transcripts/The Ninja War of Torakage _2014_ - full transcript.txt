Tsukikage. Ninja. Experts trained for covert operations, such as assassinations and espionage for powerful individuals. Ol√§. Hello, people from Japan. I am Francisco, a ninja scholar from Portugal. Are you interested in ninjas? Of course you are. Today, I would like to introduce you to the story of a ninja family. A wounded ninja runs alone. He is on an important mission, which he is carrying out for his mistress. A beautiful golden scroll. You see, this scroll is at the center of a terrible battle that is just beginning. Seemingly a quiet, ordinary village. It is... basically... the mansion of a ninja family known as the Homura Clan. In this area, villages served as training camps for ninjas. They were established throughout Japan. Here we have Gensai Shinonome. Known for her cruelty, she leads the Homura Clan. I have obtained the object from the Myokoku Temple in the Soga Province. Please confirm. I attest to its authenticity. It is only complete when it is united with its golden counterpart. Where is the golden scroll? Others are also searching for the scrolls. There was a battle... And where is it? Most likely in the Yagen Castle. I understand. Shishikage... As a ninja, you know the agreement. Master Gensai, a second chance. I swear, the golden scroll will be yours. Ladies and gentlemen, let's take a moment to learn how powerful these shurikens are. I am Hanzo Ukita, a ninja from Iga. Here are different types of shurikens. The cross shuriken. Dip the edges in poison. You don't have to slash. The kashaken. Light it up and throw it on a thatched roof. It explodes on contact. Bo-shurikens are the strongest. They can easily penetrate the human body. It's a deadly weapon. What does being a ninja mean to me? Being a ninja is my life. To be a ninja, people all over the world... Ninjas who fail are as good as dead. It is the essence of being a ninja. Do you know what to do, Yoma? Yes. Torakage is humming. Dad! Dad! Kogetsu, have you finished your lessons? Yes! He fools around all day. Not good. I hate reading. Listen. In the future, reading will be essential to be a a good man. What is a good man? Well... A good adult is someone who can protect their family. Reading cannot protect a family. Don't argue. You're arguing. I ate too quickly. Where are you going? For a poo-poo. Poo-poo? Kogetsu... Doing poo-poo is healthy. Healthy? Don't laugh. Close enough. Let me have a look at you. Gensai is asking for you. Come to the mansion immediately. I retired six years ago. I am now a farmer. So? I am no longer part of your world. Never show your face here again. You're letting him go? Let's bring him back by force. Be careful. If he had noticed anything suspicious, Torakage would have cut the rope And sent them to their death! Outsmarting opponents by predicting their movements... Clever Torakage! He was the best ninja of the Homura Clan. Papa, was your poop okay? Absolutely! It was so big! So big? Really? Papa's poop is huge. Mom's too. That's not true! What happened today? Nothing. It's no longer our concern. We found luck. You think you can leave just because you have a baby? You two make me sick! Tsukikage, take care of yourself! You're giving up your ninja obligations... for sexual pleasure? That's not it. I love him with all my heart. Silence! Master Gensai, I beg of you! It's my fault. Do what you want with me. Tsukikage... Let her go! If you insist... Hear ye! Hear ye! If one comes, all will come. Through flame... and pain they come. Those who care for children. Know their place, know it well. Save a ninja from death? Who would do such a thing? Rotten skeletons covered in maggots. Kogetsu. Kogetsu! Kogetsu! Pathetic. Nothing has changed since our last meeting. The two of you, bound and miserable. Six years ago, we paid the price and left the world of the ninja. What do you want? "Paid the price"? The only way out is death. I only let you live for one reason. I knew you would prove useful again. Kogetsu! You will be sent on a mission. Fulfill it... and you will save the child. Then I will set you free. After that, you can live happily. Covered in mud... penniless... ravaged by fleas! Undoubtedly, you know about the hidden treasure of Yagen. A loot of weapons, gold, and jewelry from the South Seas. It is a fortune secretly accumulated by the Yagen clan. Their leader hid the treasure... and wrote the location on two scrolls. A matching pair... When brought together, they reveal where the treasure is. The current lord of Yagen is Rikuri Bande. The golden scroll could be in Rikuri's castle. The treasure is essential for my expansion plans. A cruel battle is brewing on the horizon. There is no time to lose! Do you want to save the boy? You have two days to deliver the golden scroll. Go! Ninjas should complete their missions as quickly as possible. To achieve this, they undergo rigorous training. There is a record where ninjas ran more than 150 km in a single day. Let's take a rest. I'm fine. Don't push yourself too hard. Left-overs. Maybe hunters. Let's rest here. Kogetsu. We have to save him. We will be together again. On a previous mission, I was at Yagen Castle. I know the layout of the rooms. The Yagen village experiences floods every year. For the Yagen cult, nothing is more precious than water. Almost there. What is that? It's like hell. Carry this. Grudge... Grudge is coming! Hey! Do you understand? The Grudge is coming! The director of "Grudge". Let's go. The Grudge is coming! It's coming! Grandpa... Grandpa... Come out, Grandpa. There you are. Scary, isn't it? The Grudge is coming! Let's go, Grandpa. We'll go until they call "cut". Ow! Ow! Lord Rikuri is constructing a huge moat around the castle. He has his community and their children working around the clock. It's said that Rikuri has amassed a fortune through the donations of his community. The fields are neglected. The farmers are starving. I heard they ate each other during the last famine. It has gotten worse. It is time for the ritual of human sacrifice! No! Let me go! I haven't done anything! Princess Mizuki! It's the princess! Down from the highest peaks The god of water follows a dark path. Follow him further and further Since ancient times Like a flower blooming in a dream Where does the strong light come from Where is darkened by ashen clouds Let this curse... be lifted... through this mortal sacrifice. Take your anger cleanse your soul of it Mother Earth... Take this curse cleanse your soul of it For you, dear God of Water On to the next one. Get them out here! One by one! Lift more stones. Build stronger walls! Those skeletons were the remains of these sacrifices. Terrible. Come on. More! Bring in more sacrifices!! Alarm! Gonsuke! Who... Who killed Gonsuke? It's true! Kogetsu is waiting. Let's go. Serves you right! Who was it that always bullied me? Who always stole money off me? Hey! You deserved this. One for Mom. One for Dad. One for me. Hey! One for Senbei. One more for me. Next... Three at once! Bang! Bang! Bang, you're out! What a beautiful sunrise! Hey. Enough... What is it? I can't... do this any longer. What! You! Yes! Here, drink up, Mizuki. Drink! More human sacrifices. More stones! - Tsukikage, let's go. - Wait! A family. Like Kogetsu... Come! Wait! Look what the cat dragged in, Torakage. Oniman-Jew... Oniman-ji Getting someone's name wrong is rude. Now... I'll take the scroll. Look at this enthusiasm! Scum of a sacrifice. Shino, Takeo, run! Takeo! Run! Menashi, take them to the castle. In a slimy room. A red hairbrush. Night after night. The sacrifice festival. Flickering flame. The trail of a pounding pulse. A faithless rat... Screams in agony As wet as death The voice of sorrow Flesh and dripping blood White skin breaks through End of the line, Torakage. But first, the girl. Tsukikage! You dirty, cunning Homura thief... Do it. Wait. Wait! You're mistaken. We don't belong to Homura. We're like Oniman-ji. Mercenaries! What? Spare us and we'll willingly join you. Who would believe that? What if I were to offer you... the silver scroll? The silver scroll? It's said they only work as a pair. The silver one is in Gensai's mansion. I can infiltrate without arousing suspicion. That's a very interesting story. But how can I trust that you'll come back? I'll leave her here. A hostage? Don't ninjas betray their partners all the time? Tsukikage and I... aren't just partners. She's my wife. Wife? I'll give you two days. You. Look closely, Torakage. Retrieve the silver scroll before the sun passes the blade twice. Fail, and your wife will be sacrificed to the river gods. What do you say? Understood. Good. I'll be back. Hang in there. If you have to choose, forget about me. Kogetsu comes first. Stop! We will soon be a family again. How long will you bore us with this sentimental stuff? Time is of the essence... Huh? He's gone. It doesn't matter if he comes back or not. What should we do? This one is real, that one is fake. Will they find out? What should we do?! Lord Rikuri, what about my payment? You are a greedy thing. I'll pay double for both scrolls. This is Francisco. It's been a while. So, this is Torakage. He prepared a series of fake scrolls. Anticipating that he would need the real one for negotiations with Gensai... He gave Rikuri a fake scroll. What do you think Torakage has up his sleeve next? Kogetsu! Tsukikage! What should Papa do? Who goes there? You! You're alive! Thank you so much for saving my family. - How can I repay you? - No need... It was fate. Don't tell anyone you saw me. - I have to go. - No, no. Please wait. Come to my home. My wife would be happy to see you. What is that? Handmade. It uses air and can knock people down without hurting them. I'm good at building things. I was thrown out of the village for it, so I came to the mountains. By the way, I have other things too. Please take a look... This way. We're almost there. Welcome! Thank you for saving us. You are most welcome here. You have a lot of stuff. What's that? A new armor. It's not finished yet. Master, what should I do here? Well... Attach flintlocks here and here. Good idea! I'll do that. What great skill. My father was a weapons maker. My family was taken as a sacrifice. I had nowhere to go, Tokuzo took me in. The whole village is going crazy because of the flood. I thought I should think about the future. I realized that I must save not only the victims but everyone. I hope to make everyone happy one day. This is what I hope to achieve. Right? I understand. Please take a look at this. Yoshio's last work. What is it? I designed it for construction work. Hard as steel and flexible as bamboo, fifty times the strength of an individual. It has features that also help with field work. It works like a shovel, and there's a rack for firewood. Tokuzo, my friend. I need a favour. Why the long face? Even if it's wrong, I have to say it's right. That's the fate of a hired ninja. To scare people with the threat of a flood... And fill my pockets with the donations of the faithful. Don't stop. I can't stop laughing! A wild boar? I wonder if Torakage will be back by sunrise? What if he isn't? There will be a struggle for the scroll. I understand. Even if he manages to get it back... his family is going to die. An animal? Quiet. Sorry. Dad! - Mom? - I'll explain later. Let's go. So... Tsukikage is dead then? To die as a ninja is an honour. Better than dying of boredom. It's what she would have wanted. Now. The scroll. The treasure is in the reservoir of Yagen Castle. Find it! Which one? Find it! Find it! Find it! No! Damn, I knew it would end like this! Kogetsu, are you okay? Yes, I'm fine. Good job, kid! Worthless wimps! I'll turn you into boar steaks! Get behind me. Time for an explanation! Here we have the power suit of Tokuzo. Using the power of bamboo, it can lift large rocks. Climb on my back! Why are you stopping? Follow them! Kill! Tear down the walls of Yagen's dam! Surrounded by castle walls, the treasure rests on the floor of the reservoir. The legendary treasure of the Yagen cult. It was sunk generations ago. Drain the reservoir! Find the treasure! Go! Kill! They are here! What should we do? It's Mihoto and Megusu. My former students. They are persistent. Mihoto, Megusu. I treated you like sisters. Go to hell, traitor! I don't want to hurt you! I don't think you can. This is the art of the ninja! Forget about being a ninja. Once you have a family, you'll understand. Forget about family. Please understand. Absolutely not. What is that? That is... the human shuriken! By becoming a human shuriken, the ninja's back is protected. Rotating fiercely, it confuses the enemy. Torakage had been thinking about this trick for a long time. Dad! Take this! Got it! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Hey, Dad! What? Dad! You can read the ninja code? I am the son of a ninja! (Trap!) What the hell!?! I'll kill both of them! Leave them to me! Get them! Is the ninja code so important? Family is my priority. Torakage. Kogetsu. You look bored. - Stay away. - You have nothing to fear. I just want to help you pass the time while you wait for your husband. Where do you want to start? How about with the ears? Hands off! Why? What is it to you? She is destined to be sacrificed. Can't a man just have some fun? Fine, forget it. Killjoy! You are nothing without me! Don't forget that! You saved a family from being sacrificed. Thank you! These days the ritual is just a show to satisfy Rikuri's twisted desires. You were different during the ritual. Why are you in league with him? My family has overseen the Yagen religion for generations. We were a small group that wished to bring joy to people. One day, a man from the north came to us. He subverted our leader, my father, and took over the religion. He used it to line his pockets. Eventually, my father was tortured and executed. My whole family was killed. I was the only one Rikuri spared. A tool in his plan to exploit people's faith. I chose to endure and live on. One day, I will find the treasure, and save the land from the floods and bring happiness back to everyone. It was my father's wish. But Rikuri controls me with drugs. I'm just a pitiful addict... a tool of my worst enemy. Take this. Long ago, I was addicted to drugs. Torakage saved me. This will help you. Dad... are you okay? I've never been better. Bring out the human sacrifice. Damn. Come on, sing, Mizuki! Get them in the mood. I won't. I will never sing again. What? Advance! What the...? What now? Takeo, this way. He's back! Mom! You've finally returned! Rikuri, I have the scroll. Well done! Hand it over. First, release Tsukikage. Give me the scroll! Show me our scroll. "Eat shit - Kogetsu" You dare to deceive me? Let Tsukikage go! First, the scroll! Listen up, everyone! We've been deceived. By a pervert! Who are you calling a pervert, bitch? The Yagen religion is for the worship of water. Not to make people unhappy! There's no need for human sacrifices! Did you all hear that? We can stop throwing our lives away for Rikuri. We can build our own walls now! We don't have to work for him anymore! Put a stop to this. Menashi, fly. You will pay for what you did to my father. Lord Rikuri! Mom! What's going on here? Bomb Bomb Bomb Stock up on them.. Bomb Bomb Bomb Pachinko Enemies are coming Shoot them down With your favorite Bomb Bomb them all away Tear them all apart Every square inch Limb by limb Bomb Bomb Bomb Pachinko Bomb Bomb Bomb Stock up on them Look out! Pachinko! Pachinko! Hold it right there, you rascal! I have something for you! Tsukikage! Mom! Tsukikage! Mom! Are you okay? Alive... She's alive. Sons of bitches! You're destroying my paradise. Oniman-ji. Why? The scrolls could hardly interest me less. I just want to know which of us is stronger. Come on, show me what you've got. Hand over the scrolls. The scrolls! Let's call it a tie. This wouldn't feel like a real victory. Let's take care of them first. Oniman-ji. Let's save Tsukikage. Where is he? Master Gensai, over there! I finally found it. Open it. Gold! It's gold! It's raining gold! Torakage, leave these dregs to us. Attack! My shuriken has never been sharper than today. Attack, Juji! Drop your swords. Hands up! Up! Mom! Gensai... You have the treasure. Isn't it enough? What? I've never been interested in this treasure. All I want is to have Tsukikage back safely. You think I believe that? Can't you understand? A family sticks together. To hell with family. It's all crap! Family is crap! What's wrong with crap? It's an important part of life. When my child was born... I had to clean up their crap. One day... when my wife is old and can't move... I, as her husband, will clean it up for her. That's what family means. It's a sacred bond. Crap? Who will clean up your shit? Tsukikage! I'm sorry it took so long. No, I knew you would come. Mom. You owe me a favour, Torakage. Time to go, Juji. A good heart will give you strength. An evil heart will be your downfall. Thank you for your help. From now on, I will lead the Yagen to peace. This is for you. But... You are the right man to wear this mask. Looks good. Alright, let's go. They went somewhere where nobody knew them. The three of them lived happily ever after. Does it sound likely? The battle filled their hearts with a sense of purpose. The Torakage family continued their fight against evil. Well, it's getting late. We'll continue the story another time. Hey Papa! Like a strong wind The shadow of the tiger penetrates the city He keeps fighting He fights for his family. With unparalleled skill He is the ninja with incredible tricks All those bad guys They'll never know what hit them Fight! On and on! Shuriken of justice Fight! He is our man! Torakage! Torakage.
