You already know this. Have you called the police? -Do you think I'm crazy? Seems like you don't want to understand this situation? It's a big mess. A real big mess. Yes, yes. A real big mess. I can't wait a minute longer. You need to find me an alibi, -Calm down, calm down. Relax. When did you get back? -It was five thirty. Did you see anyone? -No, no. I didn't see a soul. It's better that way. We'll do our level best to catch the murderer. Your coffee. -Please, sit down. Who did you see in Milan? -Why? You know who I saw. I'm not talking about them, I'm talking about the others. Here. -No. Thanks. Did you travel by car? -Yes. Alone? -Yes, of course. You're just not getting this, I don't need a grilling... I'm here to get an alibi. -That's what I'm trying to do. This is how you treat a friend? I'll ruin you. I'll destroy you A real mess. Just try saying to the police you weren't the murderer! Will you listen to me? I don't want to go to prison. If I do, it won't be for this. I've got people behind me. Let's cut the small talk! Calm down. Calm down. -You should get to work! You should hide for a while -Where can I hide? Certainly not with my friends, If I had any. Wait by the V. Flaminia Got your car? Yes. -Good. Lawyer Savara. Giorgio. When did you arrive? -Early, this morning. Liz, something has happened... Something terrible. Something terrible. My wife was murdered. -You were out of town. Yes, but there's more... I was away but I don't have an alibi. Alibi? Do you need one? Do the police suspect you? -Husband's are always suspects Your friends can testify? -No, Liz, it's not that simple. No. None of them can testify. -Why? You were with them! Why can't they testify? -I'll tell you later. I don't understand. Then you? I don't want to lose you! Relax, I went to my solicitor, he'll find a way out of this. Come on, get up. We need to leave immediately. -Leave? Where are we going? I don't know. The judge will tell us where. Giorgio, I love you. -I love you too. Come on. How was she killed? If it was another maniac, the police will find them. You'll see, dear. Maniacs always slip up. The motorway makes me tired. -Someone must have seen you? No. You must have got a coffee? Cigarettes? Filling up? No, I'm telling you. -There's people everywhere. We must find a witness. This is bad. Try to remember. I didn't see anyone at all. Stop this interrogation. I'm trying to help you. I don't enjoy this, believe me. Should've taken her to Milan Right. Who knows why I didn't take her? You know very well why I went to Milan. God, what a mess! What are you doing? -They may be alive! Someone else will help them. -How can you say that? Have you forgotten your situation? Close it. Close it! One moment. Give me the suitcase. Quick. -Let's go. Hurry, before someone sees us. I got the keys from a friend. -Are there any lights? There's some candles inside. -We could've brought a torch. And water? -There's water. How many rooms are there in this hotel? Eighty. You'll be on the fifth floor. It's the best kept. You don't need to unpack, It's only for a few days. Liz! -The windows stay shut. Why did you bring her along? -Guess. You make an easy buck, then you just spend it! Look who's talking? I've got politicians behind me! Have any idea how much electoral propaganda costs? Why should I care? -For you it's not a problem... In this mess of yours, I can feel earth slipping under foot Don't drag this out. Spend what you have to. Otherwise, forget the election and your political ambitions. Clear? Did you kill your wife? No. You know that we are connected everywhere. It's more important for you than it is for me. Stay calm, you don't need to worry. I'll get you out of this, like in old times. Just don't compromise the situation, agreed? I am calm. Has he gone? -Yes, yes. He's gone. He didn't even say goodbye. -Well? They're all like that. Son of a bitch, blackmailer. Damn, it's dirty everywhere. It's so dusty. I'll help clean -Don't bother, I'll do it. This weekend will last a week! Won't be more than 2 days My lawyer is smart. In this darkness? We'll go mad. No, we won't, relax. It'll be fun, just us two. I'll have a look round. -Giorgio! Don't go, I'm scared Scared? Of what? There's no ghosts here. Giorgio. Come back quickly. -I'll look for some candles. Eighty rooms. It's still new. When I'm out of this, I'll buy it. It's perfect, as if it were designed just for me. I'll show you how to make money. And the others? -They've gone. The victim fell here. Have you taken photographs? Yes. 'To my wife, with love.' No traces of sperm. Have you written that down? -Yes, of course. Let's hurry up next door. The captain will be here soon. We need to open up here. Take note: The lounge is in perfect order. I scared you, eh? You're a beautiful villainess. I want to speak to Decarmine. Yes, thanks. I'll wait. Hello? Yes. Yes, put him through. -My good friend! My friend, how are you? Me too, but I can't complain. We've got a lot of work. How's the election going? I'm pretty sure you're going to make it. No, don't move I'll come over. I wouldn't dream of it! Bye. Who knows what the hell he wants? Get my car, anyone comes looking, I'll be two hours. Forgive me, Giorgio. -Yes, it's over, let's stop it. I only thought it for a moment. Maybe it's because of all this? I'm so confused by it all. -Okay, okay. It's over now. Let's clear this up: I didn't kill my wife. Okay? Don't think it, understood? -Yes, I promise. Okay. Can I still talk about her? -No! It upsets me deeply. I had a bad dream. We were at home, you and I, making love. At this point I woke up. When I woke, I felt her hands! Have these dreams often? You should write a book on it! I'm scared for you Giorio. -No, don't worry about me. This will be over soon. Judge? Judge Magerini? -What is it? Judge, please excuse me! -To tomorrow, your honour. Good morning. -Good morning. Have you read the papers? -No, I read in the evening. Why? What's happened? -They are looking for Darika If they find him I'll have them cut off your head. God damn! How are things now? -He's in a safe place for now. You got to get him to confess? -He won't confess to save us. Are you so sure it wasn't him? I'm not so sure he didn't do it. I knew this would happen. -This could happen to anyone. Have you spoken to Deromanis? -Yes, I've spoken to him. Good, you've done well to tell him. In the meanwhile, You see them? -Representatives of the pope. Are you with me because you love me, or is it my looks? Where are the batteries? -In the suitcase pocket. Ah, yes. Here they are. -Will you listen to me? Of course I'll listen to you. Tell me. Remember, at Andrea's party? -Of course I remember. It's been two years now. You said you were a big shot. You never told me why you were such a big shot? I have the right to know now. -Think of something else! What else should I think about? What's missing? You've got all you need... You have a man who wants only to please you... Who has never hurt your pride -I see: you don't trust me? I don't understand what's going on in your head! My dear friend, how are you? It's a pleasure. You still in contact with that director? Of course, your honour... I'm at your total disposition. Certainly. I kiss the hand. Hello? Yes, one moment... Malvestiti. Who is it? -Mr Caronia. Hello. -Malvestiti! How are you? What are you doing lately? -We're in final casting. On Saturday we premiere 'Matassa Disfatta', a giallo. Good, my congratulations. -Naturally, you're our guest. Listen Malvestiti, I need a favour. No, I can't say over the phone It's better I come over, okay? I'll see you at the theatre. -Okay, I'll be waiting. Bye. He's such a pain in the ass. Still, let's see. But this is Italian? -Italy produces more than most. Want some? I can't take this anymore. What time is it? I don't know, my watch has stopped. It's probably afternoon. -Why not go out and see? We're trapped, I can't. We're locked in from all sides. You've been everywhere? Like rats, male and female Nothing left for us to do but start a colony of rats Know how stupid you are? How did we end up together? You put your trust in that lawyer, while we're stuck here Sure... sure. I trust him. Now, shut up! I'm upset. The last thing I need is you stressing me. What are you thinking? That I'm calm and relaxed? I can't take this anymore. If you aren't the assassin... What did you say? You doubted me from the start -What if there's no alibi? You'll end up in prison! -Enough! Enough, I said! Liz, stop! Stop, Liz. -I want to leave! Stop it! Stop it! Have you gone mad, Liz? We'll leave. We'll leave! -Let go of me. Let go of me! Let go of me. Let go of me! Calm down. Calm down, Liz... Relax. Better? I understand how you feel, It's only fair I tell you now. Listen to me... ...but you must stay calm, can you promise me? Good. They have to save me. They've too much to lose if I go down. Above him, there are... There are powerful people. I'm innocent, I won't go down.. ..to save the reputations of those sons of bitches? I transport drugs for them. It's a circuit worth millions. This money is used to fund political careers. It's also.. ...their capital to invest in heavy industry with politicians You see, Liz? Now you know everything. Give me a cigarette. -According to their customs... they'd've killed me immediately But they haven't, so... ...they're going to help me. They need me. How can I not have noticed? Your wife was a courier? -No, she didn't know anything. I couldn't tell anyone. She never questioned you? -Certainly. Sometimes she did ask, so I invented a false business. All she wanted was a divorce, and I helped her by accepting. You never mentioned divorce? -Right. I would've told you. I wanted to surprise you. Not to propose to you... Marriage is a mistake. We lost our way not long after we got married. I love you. What's wrong? You screamed! -Someone... ...Someone was in the room. -It must've been a nightmare. There's nobody here. Look, there's nobody here. No, Giorgio... It's just us here. -I saw a shadow moving. Don't leave for any reason. Lock the door, understood? I'll go and... -No, don't go! I beg you! Don't be scared, Liz. I'll be right back. Someone there? I forgot we had guests and thought you were a thief. I killed my wife. Her jealousy made my life unbearable. I'm the owner, don't worry, you aren't involved in this... Come, come with me. -I'm here because...- You're a friend Savara's. Come, give me a hand. Do you understand? We're both in the same boat. Isn't that so? Hurry up, don't make a sound. She's over there, come on. Come on, hurry. Bring the chest. That chest. What are you waiting for? I'll help you. Let's get moving. Go, go. Be careful. Put it down there. Wait. It's clear. Let's put her on that trolley. Quiet. There. like that. Let's go. Be brave. Keep going. Keep going. Was Jesus an anarchist? The pacifists always get it. -We need a revolution. Yes! It stinks of dead bodies. -We need to fuck the system. We need to kill anyone who... -Speaking of which! They are stealing our air. -Then we can all bathe in shit Good evening. -Good evening. Have you got a light? Are you moving? -No. We're grave robbers. Good, good. Go on then! -Goodnight. Come on, let's go... Move it. Even at night there's people who try to mess you around. Climb down. Now, grab the spade and let's bury her. Nobody will find her here. Marisa, my love. Come, come Mr. Darika. Let's go and have a toast to love. But we haven't finished? -Later. We've got all night. Liz... Something terrible happened. The owners are downstairs. The owners of this hotel. -Are you sure? Yes, of course I'm sure, I spoke to them. I spoke to them. -He said the hotel's empty? They're husband and wife. No, he killed his wife. She's dead, with a slit throat. I... I buried her corpse. -Giorgio, let's go now. It's not possible. No, Liz, we can't leave. I must stay. Come, they're waiting for us. -Waiting for us? To do what? To talk and drink whiskey. A toast to love. Are you sure? Think about this for a moment. I won't believe it until I see them. As you wish, I'll get dressed. Giorgio! You were right! There's someone in the corridor Who are you? Where do you come from? I'm the daughter of the owner, you were with him recently. But you're alive? So, everyone was alive? -Are you sure you're alive? Giorgio. Leave, your woman is looking for you. No, there's nobody here. But you were talking? -Who with? Are you ill? -Stop treating me... ...like a madman. Giorgio, where are you? -I'm here, calm down. Why are you shaking like that? Wait, I'll get my lighter. Where are they? -The lounge, I think. Oh God, I feel sick. They could at least come up. -Hey, where are you? Come to us. Let's lock ourselves away? -I'll go and look for them. Take the lighter. 'No, I don't believe in ghosts, they don't exist.' 'They have never existed' 'I'm not crazy, I heard him talking. Why did he deny it?' Liz... Where are you? Liz... Where are you? Why are you looking for her? What do you want from her? -Where is she? She's using her assets to take Adolfo away from me. Where is she? -Locked in a room with him They're probably making love. You're crazy. -Making love, understand? No! -Love. You're all crazy! Have you looked in a mirror? Why're you so nervous? It's as if you have something to hide. Take her away from here, and leave us in peace. Liz? Liz, where are you? I'm looking for my wife. Know where I can find her? Your wife? Wasn't she murdered? How do you know that? I heard my father telling the woman who is with him. Did he say I was the murderer? -No, he didn't say that. Where am I? Where are we? Tell me what I look like? -To know if you're human? Tell me. How am I? Can you see what I look like? Tell me. -I can see what you look like. If something is missing inside of you, that I don't know. I don't understand anything. I'm going crazy. Can you pass my towel? Can you pass it? There, on the chair. Where has reality gone? Bathing this absurd room? While your father... Your father? My father killed my mother. You helped him bury her. Was it a nice funeral? It'll be the perfect crime if you haven't left any prints. That woman with your father? -That bitch. She said my father and Liz are making love in the hotel? You are suffering, right? Yes. Yes. But you? How do you know this? Do you love her? -Maybe. I don't know. Where are they? -That, I do not know. What would you do? Kill them? What use is that? One man more, one man less. She'll keep coming back. You can't let go of her. Now, what do you want? Tell me what's going on? Tell me. Tell me! I want to know. Don't ask for anything and you'll escape your fears. If they are both making love, why not make love to me? Come into my arms, I live to make love to you. Liz. Liz. What do you want? So, you were the 'ghost' in the corridor? Who are you? What's going on? I saw him leaving. What were you doing with him? Giorgio is my type of guy, he knows how to make love! I never made love to a killer. His blood was boiling! Giorgio isn't a murderer, he didn't kill his wife. How do you know? Did he tell you that? I can't believe a real man would trust you. What do you want from him? Leave him alone, otherwise! Otherwise? What will you do? Call the police? It's useless! I know the truth. It's time you left us alone. Get out of here. Hello, Mr. Darika. -I haven't done anything! I saw them, they're all dead. But I didn't do it! You have committed only one crime. Your wife! -No, It's not true. Confess. -It's not true. No! Keep him here. He hasn't confessed, and I guarantee you he was sincere. You left me in charge and I got it wrong. You meant you've broken him? You weren't wrong, come. You've had a good result. Look here. The cut is the same as the one on Darika's wife. You mean to say that? -Darika had the same razor. Did he pick it up as he was escaping? He didn't drop it. It was part of the plan to catch the killer But Darika's right-handed! -What do you mean? Where is Darika's woman? -Lawyer. Good morning, Commissioner. We'll interrogate the actors I'd like to start with you. Very well, I'm at your disposal. How did this story begin? -The other night at the theatre No. It's completely impossible. My actors are ready to start... I can't put them through that, with the risks involved... Turn off the projector and go. Sorry, I just can't do it. I don't want to get involved. I feel responsible for them. What if the police catch us? You can't ask me to do this. If you don't agree, we'll cut your subsidies, okay? Leave. Has he confessed? -Yes, he's confessed. See what's in his suitcase. There's a folder of documents. I wouldn't want to... You thought by terrorising him he would confess to his crime. And you did it! It's diabolical, as Giorgio said. A terrible death. Poor Adelle -Playing her part to the end. Forgive me, I killed your wife. I was obssessed with the idea of you returning to her. You were in Milan, when did you get back? Mr. Darika... ...you're free to go. Please. Commissioner, come here. -I'm coming. Good morning, your honour. -Thank you for everything. Darika. Get in. My regards, your honour. What a son of a bitch!
