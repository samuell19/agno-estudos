MOSFILM This film was conceived and prepared for production by Director Larissa SHEPITKO Cinematographer Vladimir CHUKHNOV Production Designer Yuri FOMENKO FAREWELL Based on the novel by Valentin Rasputin "Farewell to Matyora" ...And again spring arrived, another spring in its own endless sequence, but the last one for Matyora, for the island and the village with the same name... FAREWELL Hope l don't burst. Drink, girl, while the tea is real. You can't have a samovar there. Yeah... You want some, Anyuta? I've my own, no worse than yours. Here, eat it. What do I need a cucumber for? I'd prefer a dirty old man. That would tickle me! Right, Liza? Lizaveta! What is it? Remember how we tried to marry you off to old Maxim? He was really green, that old fellow. Remember how he sneaked away crawling through the gardens? You're just envious! They can't find the old man to this day, must be still crawling. Still crawling! That's whom we should marry off, if even you, his mother, can't cope with him. Who needs him? Born shrunken, will die drunken, never seeing the big wide world. If he goes straight, why not marry him? - Would you? - Why not? And you two will sing the same tune. We'll sing and dance! Sure thing! The moon got a purple-like shading, Where waves beat on rocks so strong... He's mute as a nail. - He's not mute. - Why doesn't he say something then? Why don't you teach your grandson to talk properly? He won't thank you when he grows up. When he grows up, he won't thank anybody, neither his dad nor his mom. Doesn't know him, doesn't remember her, that cuckoo flew away. I wouldn't give Kolya to her anyway. We'll get in a boat, push off, and sail wherever our fancy takes us, into the big, wide ocean. Soon... Soon... Maybe they're only scaring us? Why scare us for no reason? So that everybody be scared. The moon got a purple-like shading, Where waves beat on rocks so strong. Let's go, my beautiful, riding, I've been waiting for you so long... Damn you! Plundering the dead! Cutting down crosses! Destroying everything there! - What are you talking about? - Where? At the cemetery, Goddamn! So that's it. That's how it is. The day has come. The day of reckoning. For me, too. We won't let you do it! We're disinfecting the cemetery. And they attacked us with fence poles. Over there. They smashed my nose. Like dogs! My teeth! My teeth! The graves! Your mother and father lie here! Children lie here! There'll be a sea here and your crosses will float away! There'll be ships and people here. Is that what you want? Until Matyora is flooded, I'm boss here. I was born here, my father and grandfather were born here. Let me live the rest of my life without disgrace! People! I just found mama's photo trampled into the mud by those pigs! What's this?! You!.. Are you the chairman of the village Soviet or what... Who told you to start with the cemetery? Well, then, who didn't stop you? Where is Pinegin? Pavel Mironovich? - Where's your team leader? - Who knows. Why are you treating people like this? - Who hit him? - They're like crazy! Is this the way to start a good thing? Is this the way? These are difficult days for all of us. We all know that the bottom of a future reservoir... Don't confuse sins with righteousness! We all know that the bottom of a future reservoir must be... cleared in time. And, no matter what happens, no matter how painful it is, we must go on living like humans. Greetings to everyone. Is this a meeting? Ah, the bosses are here, too. What do you think you're doing?! You used to run around here as a kid, Pasha, remember? Try to remember, Pasha! As a kid! Have you no heart? What have I to do with this? You?! You're the team leader, you should watch over them! Pinegin... Pinegin! Sure, blame everything on Pinegin! Sure, he's from these parts, so to give him hell is no sin. I can't tear myself apart, can I? Hand over machines, accept machines, watch here, look there. It's easy for them to issue orders. Of course, he's running from one shore to the other, anyway. Rushing about from mother to wife, taking care of two homes. How can I keep track of every fool who desecrates graves? What can I do? You think it doesn't make me sick at heart? How many times have I told you to get ready? No, no way! Being stubborn as though you're being moved off to America. Of course, it's difficult at first. No wood to chop or stoves to fire. Some even want to take the cows and sheep with them. Where will you keep them? There's no grass there. All right, mother. Stop torturing me. I'll move the graves over. The granddad's and the grandmother's. Have patience. We've been in space for half a year now and I still can't get used to the beauty of the earth as it's seen from up here. It's impossible. Nyunya. Nyunya. That's enough. Come on out. Where're you, dear cows?.. Hear me? Come out! Darya... Why us? Did we do something? Everyone in his time. You're first, we'll wait. Damn, where are you? Go on. Lock it. Just a minute. - Yegor. - What? What do I do with the keys? Throw them in the river. Give them to me. It's all right. Nastasya! Coming. Don't wrap the samovar up taking it out of the house. Why not? It's a bad sign. It should see where to return. Those signs don't mean anything to us anymore. All right. Let's go. It's all right. Maybe everything'll be fine. Mother earth, moist earth. Mother earth, moist earth... Mother earth... You're blessed, you're consecrated, you... You... You're blessed. You're consecrated. You're the tsar of tsars. You're the tsar of tsars. Be kind, have mercy. Be kind, have mercy. Be kind, have mercy. Oh Mother Earth, you're blessed, you're consecrated, you're adorned with herbs and flowers. The sun and stars shine on you, and evening dawns. Father Tsar of fire, you're the tsar of tsars, you're the fire of all fires. Be kind, have mercy. I pray to you, Father Tsar Fire, burn all our grief, our fears and worries, but don't touch any of us. I will ask you, Father, I will ask you, red sun, why these guests came, and stand here as never before. Unfamiliar people came, the unheard-of guests are standing. As the moon is bright in the sky, the snows are dead, let their deeds be dead too. You are a fire before me, I am strong water before you. A fast stream is persevering, Mother Earth is patient. Lightning burns, forest destroys, grasses stir, water washes, sand buries. A key and a lock to my words. A duck and a stone lie. The stone has no eggs. The duck has no milk. A key and a lock to my words. Let my words be strong and biting for my cause. Stronger than a steel knife, sharper than the sharpest sword. A key and a lock to my words. Amen, and three times more amen. It stands! Just you wait, my beauty, let me feast my eyes on you! Greetings, pal! Why, it's a whole house! Yeah, enough for a whole house. - With a bathhouse. - And firewood for winter. Right! Could build a cycle track. A barge with a restaurant! A restaurant! Well, old man? Where are we going to put it? It'll fall to earth anyway. - What are you whistling for? - I'm calling. A real brute. Start it up. - Well... - Like 2 and 2 make 4! We have it 5 and 5 make 25. Let's go, guys. Where to? The commission will come, where will you hide it? Cover with your jersey? Give it to me! Stop it! You'll ruin the saw! And yourself. The hell with it, let it stand. That's easy to say. And later it'll stick up out of the water like a buoy, right? All right, do it! Welcome, dear guests! Thanks for coming and helping our farm. Here's what we have to do. Make hay for our farm cattle on the island before the island is flooded! Let's make Matyora the most advanced Matyora! Good luck, dear comrades! And congratulations! You should have left earlier, not to see all this. That's what I have eyes for, Andrei, to look at everything. When do you plan to leave? As soon as your father tells me to. Is there a deadline? Yes. They should also let a person know when it's time to die, then we would get ready for it, and not fuss about needlessly. That would be funny. You're alive and well, and in your passport, date of death is right next to date of birth. Say, if you wanted to get married, first let's see, my dear, when you're supposed to die. And she wants to know it, too. If the date's no good, no wedding. They run in different directions. Right, run. Everything's done on the run nowadays, they run to work, they run to the table. No one has any time. Galloping from one place to another, ready or not. Anything, only not to stand still. Even babies are born on the run. The baby hasn't even started living and it's already out of breath. It's such a pity to watch it. Why do you pity everyone, grandma? Don't you know that pity humiliates a person? I can't help it. How can I not pity a Christian? He's no stranger to me. But why do you pity him? He's a great muddler, a human being. As though he does everything the other way around on purpose. He does what he doesn't want to do. He doesn't feel like laughing. Maybe he wants to cry, but he laughs. He has to go left, but he goes right. Then he realizes that, feels ashamed, and gets angry with himself, and that means he's angry with the whole world, and he feels even more miserable, even more wretched. You think that Petrukha isn't tired of playing the village fool? He's no fool, you know. He knows he's not living but putting on airs, that it's not him who goes out to people, yet he makes everyone believe he's someone else. And how is someone else better than you? Old Tatyana had a daughter-in-law, married to Ivan. - You mean Gutka? - Yes, Gutka. She was a show-off. She made believe she was cross-eyed, kept blinking her eye all the time. She used to hide a hammer in the outhouse. If anyone saw her going there, she would make out she went there to fix something with that hammer. You may ask her who doesn't go there? What should she be ashamed of? And that's the way we all are, hammering what's been hammered. You're just something, grandma! Man is king of nature, he can do any- thing, and you talk about an outhouse. Right, the king. First he's glorious, then he's penurious. We'll see, grandma, we'll see. You may see, not us. To the working class from the toiling peasantry! Greetings! Greetings! Greetings! To your dear guest, uncle Pasha! Granny Darya, to your grandson! They say you left the factory. Good for you! What happened? Did they treat you badly? No, he just doesn't want to drive that trolley for the rest of his life. That's not for us. We want bigger things. Right. What now? The hydropower station. Wants to be up front. The factory is for the older and family men. To get their pension. - Am I right? - Right. We'll build the station and it'll stand a thousand years. Right! Granny Darya, we should drink to that! Andrei, you've persuaded me. I'm with you, we'll go together. Couldn't you find another place? People need electricity, grandma. And out Matryona will turn into electricity, it will help people. That's right! As though our dear island was bad for people before. Right! To electricity! Have you gone crazy? Oh, Andrei, we'll really do something soon! - You sure did something today already. - Yesterday and the day before too. Look at it, while it's free. Soon you'll need a ticket, and only in a museum! Pyotr Zotov's house! To its memory! Three thousand in cash. An architectural monument, property of the Academy of Sciences. Casing, carving, ridge! One hundred years old! Soon every log will be packed in straw and floated down on a separate ship. Yes, soon everything will float here. They promised three thousand. Two years ago, one to go. I believe the academicians. Maybe your academician is already dead? There were five of them here. They couldn't all have died. Where's uncle Fedya's house? It was cooler, more interesting than yours. Here it is. This is cooler? This is more interesting? Soon as he learned they were flooding the island, he nailed it shut and left. He was some man, uncle Fedya! They say I'm old, But I don't believe it! When I look at myself: I'm alive, come feel it! I'm a temporary hooligan, I rave and rant! I won't tell you where there's A man who's pregnant! In the meadow, in the grass, With his hand right up my ass, Didn't let him go too far, Said I'd rather watch a star! Vanya jerking in the throes, Banging kopecks with his nose, Hits them, hits them, no luck, I said, better use your... fist! Fell in love with my team leader, Forgot the cow and didn't feed her. Now I know just what it's like, No fun like flying a kite! Old man, old man, I feel like having fun, Went to dig for a good carrot, What I needed the garden hadn't. Let's swim! Fire! Matyora is on fire! Woke up from the smoke. And my hair was crackling! I broke the window and jumped out. Or would have been a goner. Uncle Pasha! Uncle Pasha! Uncle Pasha, a fire! Look. I started the stove going, and lay down. Maybe a damned coal fell out. Some trouble I started, huh? Bastards... If only I knew who was the bastard that did it... Just had time to save the accordion. Here, hold it. What are you staring at? Why are you staring, eh? And the blanket. Mother. Give me a smoke. I know you use snuff. You must have some. Like hell... Like hell you'll smoke. You'll remember this. Stop insulting your mother! Get out of here! Get out, I said! Who's got matches? No one? What people! Can't even give a light. Here it is. Well... What now... That's the way it will be for everyone. You're the first. But it'll be easier later. We've got to leave anyway. Comrades. The power station builders have promised to prepare the territory for flooding a month earlier than planned. The weather forecast for the next ten days is rain. Therefore, we have decided... to stop haymaking and use everyone... to clean up the territory to be flooded. We'll dismantle the sawmill and flour mill. Those who came for the harvesting will be sent back today. All farm animals must be evacuated by September 6. We ask the locals to give all possible assistance to prepare the island for flooding. What Pyotr Zotov did can be an example to others. I'm right here! Don't wait till the last day. By September 14, 4 p.m., no one should be on the island. Any questions? Pavel Mironovich. Sign this. What's this? Responsible for carrying out the set goal is Pavel Mironovich Pinegin. That ends the meeting. Comrades, don't go yet! Here's an announcement for parents! A boat will leave for the boarding school on August 31 at 7 p.m. Please have the children ready, with their things packed. They should be dressed in holiday clothes. And don't be late! We won't wait for anyone! We're standing here on the land that seemed perpetual to us. But soon, this will be the bottom of a lake. The truth now is that we must leave. We must, whether you like it or not, prepare for a new life there. And not torture ourselves with thoughts of the life we had here. Why do we have eyes in front and not in back? So we can look forward, forward, not to the past. Not one living soul will remain on the island by the end of the day on the 14th. Hi. Hello. - Going home? - Yes. - Hi! - Hello. Hold it. What is it, grandma? Speak up. I need your help, Andrei. There's no one else except you. We have to take the graves of our dear ones off the island with us. Otherwise we'll never forgive ourselves. Of course, grandma. It's no big deal! Get out of there! Go out to the people! Go out to the people, you screwball! Get out! Hiding in the cellar! You whore! Consorting with them, hanger-on! Those damned profiteers! And you're with them! You don't have any right! Flooding people! The Flood! I know the law! Hurry, children. Come on, quick. All right. Children. Children, say goodbye to your native village. Three-four. Farewell, Matyora! You forgot! Hey, you forgot! They forgot it. Farewell, Matyora! End of Part One FAREWELL Part Two Where are you going? Where? Get off there! This isn't your machine! Come on! Get away! Andrei! Andrei! Sneaking out by the backyard? Try crawling on your belly! Looking for the culprits, father? Go on, look. That's enough, mother! Enough! Wait till we get out, don't light it up. I know without you telling me. Vitka, get into the boat! What about setting fire? We'll do it without you. Fyodor! Fyodor! Coming! Finish it, let's go! Fyodor! Hurry, we got to go! Coming! Stop. I can't see someone suffering. Misha. You want some help? Fyodor! All right, one woman less, easier on the horse. Right. Let's go. Village of Kashkino! Folks from Kashkino, stand by the pole! Go! Go ahead! Go! Go! Villages of Gorevoye and Yegoryev! You'll go later. I repeat, Gorevoye, Yegoryev, you'll go later. Uncle Pasha! Uncle Pasha, dear! You're one of us! Why are you standing? Get back! Pinegin! Pavel Mironovich! You going to the settlement? - Yes. - Get in. Uncle Pasha! Where are you going? I got some for you too, uncle Pasha! Are you the village chairman Vorontsov? I am. The people have been waiting half a day. Where're the trucks? Tell Shutov. What is he thinking about? I'll tell him. Hey, uncle Pasha, don't turn me down! Come on, uncle Pasha! What kind of man are you? Uncle Pasha! Oh, Russia, Mother Russia... Waiting for the flood to start building their ark... Waited till the last minute. Now, in one day 50 families all together. Prokofyevna, did they connect the gas? Yes, thanks. - Want to warm up on the brick stove? - Why... no, no. How are you doing? Everything ready? What's wrong? Nothing. Something happened? It's nothing. - Tell me. - It's nothing! I'm just tired. I can hardly walk. I can't understand it. Let me go. Appoint me a driver or a guard. Anything but not this. I just can't anymore. All right, I let you go. - Who'll take my place? - What difference does it make? Why must I burn Matyora down? For the sake of what? I understand. Electricity, the power station, progress. But why me? What for? Did you see that jerk with a mug at the pier? Ah, that's how they're treating Pinegin now! Don't you see, a hundred years from now they'll say about me: that's the one who burned Matyora to the ground. Why? What the hell do I need it for? No, that's it! From now on, do without Pinegin. Great. You won't make me do it anymore. That's enough. I'm human, too. Yes... You're no march for your mother. By the way. Where is she? Did you take her off the island? What do you mean by "they'll say about us in a hundred years"? In a hundred years... He's worried about what they'll say in a hundred years about him. And what will be on this land in a hundred years from now? What kind of cities? What kind of houses? What will... the people look like? No. Now you tell me, what are you living for? What for? I know. Don't you bullshit me. Just say: you've got to do it, Pinegin. Just one word, "got to". And I'll go and do it. I'll have a drink, and I'll do it. Why not if it has to be done? Don't do it. Don't do me any favors. I don't need a drunk man to do it, with neither head nor heart. Enough. Vasily Alexeyevcih. Vorontsov! Vorontsov! We're waiting! Where are you? We have the privilege of living. We have the privilege of believing. So believe and live. With everybody and for everybody. Live for those who will come, for whom everything is being done. Believe. And you'll get filled with a great invincible strength. Believe. Kolyanya... Here. I can't anymore, girls. I'm beginning to see double. Yes, enough. Look how much there is. Enough, enough. What do we do with it? Can't leave it in the ground like that. Girls, the restaurant is here! Would you like some, boys? Let's go. What's the matter? Did you ever feel, there's no one around, but feels like someone's talking to you? Who's talking? I don't know. As though someone right here is asking. Oh, goodness gracious! Asking what? It's somehow dim and heavy. I can't say about what. I must be going crazy. I wish it came about sooner... Sometimes it seems to me that I've already lived once. And this is my second life. And this is her tenth, I suppose. Maybe it's not you who's living right now. - Who, then? - Maybe someone else. And I, God forgive, can't say that it was me who has lived. Things just don't seem to fall into place. All right, women, that's enough digging. That's too much. The last barge leaves tomorrow. Get ready. Give us another day. That's enough! I postponed it two times already. Enough! What is it? What?! Pavel Mironovich! Yes? Coming! All right, girls, let's get up. No digging anymore where we're going. Wrap it up. That's it. All right. You prankster. So we leave the graves under water? The graves of our kin. We don't have time, do we?! You can see that for yourself. And not only we do that. That's how we... ...will be left. And forgotten. Oh, God, that's all I need! Well, what is it? What do you want? Yegor... - Yegor... - What about Yegor? He's dead. It's me, father. It's me, mother. Here I am. Time to die. It's time. I'm ready. But I can't lie with you, I just can't. No. Our family ends with me. I, the cursed one, am leaving. I'll start another cemetery. Who will forgive me? It's smoky. It's smoky here. Can't breathe because of the smoke. You can see for yourselves. Can you see me? See what I look like now? Can I stay with the living like this? I belong to you. I've got to come to you. You said I should live long, father. I did. And what for? Just for the sake of living? Or for the children? Or for some other reason? For the sake of what? The earth beckons. Oh, how it beckons... What should I do? Where are you? Why don't you answer? Why don't you answer? Why don't you say something? Where are you? Where? You're foolish, you are. Why ask? We see all, and all will be called to answer. We see you like at an exhibition. We're watching carefully what each is doing and thinking and remembers. Truth is in memory. Those who have no memory... ...have no life. But that's not all. You hear? That's not all. Not all the truth is here. Oh, you people, you want too much. They want to know the whole truth. That's going too far! Go all the way, while your legs still carry you and eyes see. Go all the way that's been allotted you. Then we'll meet. Then you'll find out. Let me, I'm younger than you are. Don't, I've got to do it myself. Granny. Are you in your right mind? You plan to live here? All right. She can stay the night. Hello, granny. Good day. Hi, granny. Come on, come on. Go ahead, I'll catch up. Go ahead. Go, granny, we'll do it all ourselves. Come on, go. Well, all right. We're leaving you in charge, old man! We can't wait anymore. You'll set fire to your fortress yourself, understand? Here's the jerry can. You got matches? What are you hollering for? He can hear just fine. - Really? - I can see by his eyes. You got matches? Bastard! We got them. We'll do it ourselves. Well, go ahead then. I'm counting on you, old man. Too bad to part with you! Well' good luck! Where are we, old man? What village is this? I asked what village this is? - Look at the map. - We've got a new map. Come with us, granddad, or you'll drown. Well, so long, then. He's like some goblin. Where are they?! So, you're resting! Where's my mother? Where is she?! Over there, where else? There? Now you remembered about her? Where have you been before? What do you mean, there? Have you got a heart?! There'll be a commission on the island tomorrow. Have you got no conscience?! Why are you yelling, you alcoholic? Barging in like that at night! I've trusted him with my mother! Stop that outrage! Really. I can't be in two places at the same time. Just got home after work. Went to bed. Go to hell, all of you... Why in the middle of the night? I could do it in the morning. They've gone absolutely crazy, giving people no peace at night. Keep quiet! I was thinking of going there in the morning. I wouldn't have left them there, would I? I was imploring them yesterday. Trying to talk them into it. I can't force them, for God's sake. Uncle Pasha! Uncle Pasha! What about me? Stop! Wait! I saw no reason to hurry. Only a shack left there. Give it a shove and that's all. And Matyora's gone. We can report. Hey, wait! Wait. I'll be right there. Let's go! I've got Makeyich shut up inside. He'll wake up, and won't get fucking out. Only through the window. He'll get out - the boat is gone. That'll teach him how to sleep long. I aspire to be a diver - let them teach me to be one! It's foggy. Maybe we should go back? Wait and wait. She hasn't had enough time here. Give her a day and then another and another. Doesn't say no, yet won't go. Well, if she were alone, but no, they all are backing her. She makes it difficult for everyone. We can't take it anymore! Now listen here, Pavel Mironovich. Tomorrow the commission will examine the island. And we'll hand it over on schedule. They'll start flooding it in time. In time there will be plants and factories built here, and new towns. And no one, no one can stop the march of events. I just had to take one more look at Matyora. I just had. I wanted nothing else, food got stuck in my throat. I decided to go and get my cat, Nyunya. Is my Nyunya alive? Nyunya... Nyunya, damn it... He used to sit by the window, listening to the radio. I say: "Yegor, go take a walk. Don't just sit. Go talk to people." But he just sat, waiting for it to rain. "I want it to rain", he said. That evening, I put out the light, went to my folding bed and fell asleep. Fell asleep, damn me. When I woke up, it was dark, and it seemed to be raining outside. What's happened, I thought. There were no clouds the evening before. I got up and looked - it was raining. I say quietly: "Yegor, it's raining. What did you want the rain for?" He doesn't say anything. I'm feeling for the switch on the wall. I turned the light on. And the light... ...was white... ...so bright. Well? Well, well... We're lost. I knew it. We'll get there sometime. - We will. - We are there. We've got to turn back. Back. And which way is back and which is forward? Turn right. It couldn't have disappeared. I've sailed here for 20 years. - It's here somewhere. - Here. You should drink less. Or maybe more. Shut up. - Twenty years, he says. - Shut up! Twenty years! He's been sailing here for 20 years. Turn towards shore. Otherwise we won't find anything. Out of fuel. Where are we? Are we alive or not? Seems like we're not. Well, never mind. It's easier together. What is it now? Night? Day? It's dark, can't see a thing. Cut the motor. Cut it! It's flooded... Uncle Pasha. Matyora's been flooded. Uncle Pasha, do you hear me? Our Matyora is no more! Stop that! Stop that. What do you want? Wrap it up. Wrap it up. - Soak it. - Soak it... Got matches? Start yelling. Yell what? Anything you want. They're here somewhere, right here. We'll find them. Matyora! Matyora! Written by L.
