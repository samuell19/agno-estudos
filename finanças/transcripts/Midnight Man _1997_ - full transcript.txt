You look bored, my friend. It's pretty here. And there isn't a great deal to do. There's a much better view from the bridge. Let's walk up there. Who sent you? Dovotny? What will you do? Kill me? I wanna tell you a story. Little zen story. A monk falls off a cliff, but he managed to grab hold of a little branch with one hand. It's clear he'll fall to his death any second. He sees the strawberry growing on the cliff. He picks it and puts it in his mouth. Now, a man runs up to the top of the cliff, looks down, sees the other monk, smiling. He shouts down, "You're about to fall to your death!" "Yes," says the monk, "but the strawberry is sweet." I don't understand. Look. It's the most beautiful view, don't you agree? Beautiful. Done. Good. Dovotny, you must miss the old days when you let your KGB boys handle these things. The only constant is change. I have someone I would like you to meet. Who's that? Mr. Engel, meet Mr. Tayi. He would like to hire you for a day. For $50,000. The money's all right. But the question is whether I'll found the job amusing. For that kind of money, I'm sure you'll find the job amusing. I think you'd better find someone else. I'll be seeing you, Dovotny. Mr. Engel is an artist. I'm sorry I showed insufficient respect, Mr. Engel. Apology accepted. Now what is it you want? Come on, honey. Why don't you get us a bottle of wine, too? I'll be back. Bye. Fancy meeting you here, Sean. Is this business or pleasure? That's just what I was going to ask you. Coincidence that both of us are in town? I live here. I'm engaged to the girl. So unlikely it has to be true. Well I a working at the moment. Two questions. Has someone hired you as backup in case I screw up? No. Someone hired you to stop me. John. I don't work for anybody anymore. I got out. Well in that case, have a nice day. Enjoy yourself. Sean? Oh, and name the first one after me, if it's a boy. Who was that? An old friend. Come on. Subject under surveillance, moving northwards onto large road. On Canada 14. Coming to 15 now. Roger. Got him. He turned off by the old steel box. On 16 now. He's approaching the old mineworkers. That's where they must be going. He's speeding up. Pursue, but let him lose you. Make it convincing. If you say so. We have a spotter plane taking over surveillance. Roger dispatch, we're on our way. Here we go, then. He's on his way to the site. As soon as he gets there, we start the raid. 45 minutes. Here you go, sir. Ah. I don't believe it. Congratulations. Your man is John Engel. Our cells in the Americans have been looking for him for 10 years. Well that changes everything. We need some cover. Is Dillon still in town? Who? As far as I know. Put the raid on hold. I want one of our men there. He's not exactly our man, sir. He'll come. What good will one more man do? Depends who that man is. Can't you see I'm busy? Why don't you get out of here? I'll get you later. I knew you were there. I knew. Forget about 'em. Come here. I gotta see who this is. Oh my God. Come in. Good afternoon. Su Yin, you remember Brigadier Ferguson. The PM's man in charge of things no one's supposed to know about. Nice to see you again. Detective Chief Inspector Bernstein. I hope we haven't come at a bad time. Oh, no. A very good time in fact, that's the problem. I'll go make some tea. Come in. Well what are you doing here? Our British Ambassador's arriving here next week. A high profile signing of a new trade pact. We've been watching some fairly Third Reich conspiracies might be planning a hit on him. We've got a place here in the city and another in the countryside. So what does that have to do with me? I would've thought you guys would be able to handle Third Reich conspirators. He's on his way to the camp. Well there's nothing Third Reich about him. Did you know he was in town? No. The local security people have got the place surrounded. Be a great coup to get Engel. Well you'd never take him out. He'd have to stand trial, it'd be a big circus. Shame to do something like that to a free spirit like him. Free spirit? Is that what you call him? We have reason to believe he was involved in the kidnapping of three top European industrialists, none of whom were returned alive. Rumor has it, he had a hand in Lockerbie. Well when you're in Engel's league you get credit for a lot of things. Whether you did 'em or not. Same thing happened to a man named Sean Dillon. Maybe that was true in the past, but you've been working for the right side, he hasn't. Sean is not working for anyone at the moment. There you have it. I just thought you might like to come along, watch the finale. I think you got something else on your mind. He's the best. Better than you? Maybe. I'm the only one who thinks like him. You want me around in case something goes wrong. Something along those lines. I'm not interested. I'm sorry you had to waste your trip. Not to worry. Are you serious about the girl? I've asked her to marry me. I'll come straight to the point, Sean. I've got files on you that'll keep you tied up in the courts or worse for years. It would be a shame to do that just when your life has taken a turn for the better. Why don't you look on the fee as a wedding present? I hear Engel saved your life once. He saved it twice. But who's counting? I'll get my jacket. You're pathetic, you are. Let's go in and see anymore like you inside. Don't move! Who are you? Mr. Tayi thought you might need some help. We don't need any help. We can do what we were sent to do. I doubt that very much. Your French base is under surveillance. Drop that! I was followed part of the way here. I lost them but I wouldn't be surprised if they knew about this place, too. They cannot. And if you think they do, why have you come? Because I'm getting paid a great deal of money to look you over. I wanna see everything you have and I wanna know every detail of your plan. How do we know you can be trusted? I can't be. Now let's get on with it. I've never thought of you as the marrying kind. Two great irrationals. Love and war. That's very cynical for a married man. Come to think of it, Bernstein, why are you still single? You know what they say? All the best men are either married or gay. Or already engaged. Sir likes his little jokes. I brought my wife along this trip. Very fond of Europe. And our little granddaughter. What does your wife think of your line of work? She's an old-fashioned English woman. Doesn't ask questions, doesn't complain. I'm lucky to have her. Do you ever tell her that? Of course, not. But then, I'm an old -fashioned English man. Su Yin understands but, don't expect anything more out of me after tonight. I'm getting out of this thing. And doing what? Semtex. Enough to blow the Ambassador's limousine into the sky. And here are the detonators. It will work. Maybe. Show me the plan. It picks up the body heat. They have four people inside. No one has left. Excuse me, may I? This is the load that was followed the last two times-- Quiet. A farmer. There another way out of here? We're not as stupid as you think. There is a tunnel. Show me. But it's only a farmer. I said, show me. You were friends, you and Engel. Oh, friendship isn't really big in our circle. You never know when you're gonna be on the opposite side. The man's an animal. Yes. But that's not all he his. Ready, with your consent, Brigadier. Yeah, we were friends. Carry on. It was already here. All we had to do was clean it out. I think it dates back to World War II when the Germans-- Where does it lead to? Come out now. I command you must come out with your hands on your head. Hurry, we must. You'd slow me down. Come out now. You have 10 seconds. They blew themselves up rather than be caught. Three of them were dead before the blast. I think the fourth was Engel. He disappeared. No one disappeared, my friend. I'm gonna go in there. Take some men. They'll slow me down. Sean. You lied to me, didn't you? He came to me after we talked. And now you're working for him. Consulting. You used to have standards. Now what? Now I take you in. You know better than that. We're on the same side, Sean. No side. I blew up in that factory. You'll still collect your consulting fee. They'll turn up. Another time, another place. You do owe me one. Different game every time. In that case, you'll have to kill me. I'd rather not. No. You all right? Yeah, headache. What happened? The tunnel came out here. We were both armed. My gun jammed. He hit you? Yeah. That's it for me. Donate my fee to a worthy cause. Horrible way for those men to die, by fire. They were dead before the explosion. The security forces shot them? I did. You shot them? One man had a chance of getting away. Four men wouldn't have. Your orders were to exec-- I did you a favor, Mr. Tayi. No extra charge. There wasn't enough left of them to identify. There's no chance of it being traced back to you. I figured they were not up to the job. They weren't up to blowing up a balloon, much less the British Ambassador. Well then it would appear I need to employ you further. Are you interested? First, I wanna know what it's all about. Fill me in or count me out. Listen to me, Mr. Engel. My reasons are none of your business. My money is, if you want the job. Now this is about justice, this is about principle. Okay, okay. You think the Brits are gonna sit still for it? We won't be claiming credit for anything. Credit me with some subtlety. Then who will? The choice of targets and other evidence will make it clear that the force behind these so-called terrorists acts is the IRA. A renegade faction that has always opposed the Irish Peace Plan and is out to destroy it. I am so glad that for once, I am ahead of you. You used to have links at the IRA. So did you. Things change. Do you have a problem with this? The only problem I have is if my fee's late. Then let's get down to business. The Ambassador's still the target. One quarter of a million dollars if he dies. That's fine with me, Mr. Tayi. But diplomats and politicians, they're a dime a dozen. You wanna annoy the British or do you wanna harm them? I've always answered that. It'll have to be a better target. Enlighten me. I thought I hired you for your expertise and your imagination. You haven't hired me yet. It'll be a full million. Done. A quarter of a million up front, show good faith, the rest when you're finished, plus expenses. And if you need any help with the operatives. I don't use fanatics. They're too willing to die for their cause. I only work with people who don't wanna die. Now who's our first target? Someone we've already encountered. Dillon. Two weeks ago, I would have said yes. But Dillon's lost his nerve and killing him wouldn't mean anything. Officially, he'd beat his own, is just another dead terrorist. Good point. Then who? Ferguson. The old man? Don't underestimate him. They'd have to give his death a headliner, too and it'll hurt them. If you say so. So he's the first target. Who's next? That's my secret, Mr. Engel. But let me put it this way, we're about to change British history. You can still change your mind, you know? Are you talking to me or yourself? I just never thought much of marriage. So what changed your mind? What, are you fishing for compliments? No, just curious. Because we can talk or sit in silence for hours. That means something. If I do give this up, what'll I do? Be with me. You'll find something. You don't know everything I've done. Nor do I wish to. I know who you are. That's enough for me. Do you think it'll change him? It already has. Is Mr. Tayi on the lever? As much as any of us. He believes the next big battle will be between Islam and the west. He's right. And he believes that Syria will be leading the next jihad. Stranger things have happened. Is there anyway I can help? I need one backup man. Not one of Tayi's fanatics. Just someone who will shut up, do as he's told, and won't panic if things get hairy. I have a man in place in Paris. He's yours. What's your stake in this? Making mischief. Hoping for a comeback at home, aren't you? Vladimir Korchov will take up the reigns of power as soon as things get bad enough. The people will beg him to do so. I hear he's a drunk and a mad man. Yes. Just the sort of man the time demands. And a good friend of mine. Tayi tells me that you want to eliminate Ferguson. Ferguson's little group will cause a disproportionate amount of trouble. I'll take him out while he's still in Luxembourg looking after the British Ambassador. He was always worthy opponent. I like him. Would you rather I didn't kill him? I didn't say that. You look at peace. It's not a feeling I'm used to. Is it one you could get used to? Maybe. I hope so. I'm very happy. He could have killed me, I wonder why he didn't. Engel? Well, you said you could have killed him as well. That's true. Why didn't you? I guess if I knew that, I'd have the answer to my question as well. Good day, sir, may I help you? Have you lost someone close to you? More than one, dear. More than one. Is Jack about? Who shall I say is asking for him? Harry Lite. Peter Macintosh. Billy, please see whether Mr. Harvey's available. Imperial. The Grandee. The Perpetual. Where are these? Coffins or ships? Just a box of wood to keep out the worms for a bit, no? We don't think of it in quite those terms. This way. Still playing with stiffs, I see. It's always been more than that. It's an art form. I'm sure it is. And a challenge. Especially when there's been a lot of damage. What can I do for you this time? How are you doing for shoulder fired rockets these days? They're all the rage. It doesn't dare to be too garish like some of them are. I thought of going into theatrical makeup, you know? But working with actors. Much more temperamental than your current clients. I need you to deliver to Luxembourg. Ah, there we do have a problem. Why's that? Crackdown by the customs boys. You'd do better to go to a more local supplier. France. Can you recommend one? The Joubert brothers. They do vehicles, guns, Semtex. I'll give you a phone number and a code word. Can I trust them? As much as you can never trust a frog. Terrible lies and cheats, they are. And no sense of presentation for their dear departeds. Quite attractive, don't you think? You don't ever interfere with them, do you, Jack? Don't be offensive. I'm a professional. I'll get you that number. 10% commission, all right, if you get what you want? Five. I'll be coming back to you for supplies when I move base to London, all right? In that case, I shan't quibble. Not as nice as your London office. Well, I don't think my Europe colleagues want me to be so comfortable. I might stay. Your wedding present. Thank you. No honeymoon? Weekend in Versailles. Look at this. Now all I need is a pipe and a dog to fetch my paper. Thanks for coming in. What's on your mind? Need your advice on something. Three men and a considerable amount of explosive went up in that building. Do you think whoever it is can reorganize by this weekend? Well, Engel doesn't rush a job and that's to your benefit. On the other hand, he's going to have something to prove to whoever hired him after that fuck up, so. Well is that a yes or a no? It's a maybe. A maybe I'd take very seriously if I were you. If you were me, what would you do? Buy some slippers and retire. I'm considering that, but not by this weekend. Well, he's going to need weapons, he's got to get them somewhere. He won't work fanatics. They're too unreliable. The question is, does he have the right contacts here? Do you? I've heard some names. Tell me who they are. I'll get the security boys to check them out. You're gonna use a hatchet. You need a scalpel. Well is Dr. Dillon available? No. You haven't set a lot of money aside. I didn't save for my age 'cause I didn't think I'd have one. If you stick with us on this one, a little pension fund. 100,000 pounds. Well the security forces are more flush than I thought. It's available. No blackmail this time. That was an emergency, this time I'm asking as a personal favor. Well when you put it to me that way and you put the money in an unmarked Swiss account, I'm in. You're a big softie. Ah, Mr. Mcintosh. I'm Pierre, this is Jacob. How is the old friend, Jack? Still happier with dead people than live ones. Can you fill my order? Of course. How much of commission is Jack asking these days? He's asking 10, I'm giving five. Of course, if we say the order is smaller than it really is, then you save on commission and we could split your savings. Jack gets his 5%. Just trying to be helpful. Load the damn thing into my van, all right? The money. What's this? Maybe your brother's just playing around with himself under that desk, but somehow I doubt it. Bring those hands out so I can see them please. We're just being careful. So am I. The money. This is a surprise. How's your father? It's cancer. How far along? They don't know yet. I'll do a biopsy the day after tomorrow. Well they can do a lot these days. What upset me the most is I've never seen him scared before. He's dealt with death many times as a rabbi. Do you know what he said? "Somehow, you never think it's your own turn." Well I wouldn't bury him yet. You're right. Why are you here? I've got a call to make. You up for it? I could certainly use the distraction. You working with us? Ferguson appealed to my better nature. And Su Yin? Understands. Well, at least dogs like you. How about a doggy biscuit? Who are you? What do you want? A man came to see you sometime in the last few days, wanting to buy weapons, Semtex maybe. Brown hair, about my size. Look, we sell heavy machinery here. I can call the police, you know? All right. Let's stop wasting time. I'm tired of messing around. Why don't you tell me what you know? I don't know what you're talking about. All right. Which one of you's older? Me, why? Come here, baby brother. Why don't you sit in the front row? What are you? Right or left handed? All right. Let's start with your right. This is a dull blade so I may have to do some sawing. Sean. Just give him the information. Do you have something to tell me? You're bluffing. You can't do that! You can't-- I'm gonna start with his little finger. He was here today earlier. What did he buy? Rocket launcher, shoulder mounted. Why? He didn't tell us. He didn't tell us! All right. I bet he didn't. Thanks for the hand. You stay put. 15 minutes. Looks like it's on. Why did you ask which one of them was older? Older brother syndrome. They'll usually look out for the younger one. You would have cut his fingers off, you bastard, wouldn't you? Well if he hadn't said anything after the first couple, I would have known we had the wrong place. It's only me! And it's only me. Who are you? Where's my family? They're quite safe. Where are they? You're the driver for Brigadier Ferguson, right? What have you done with them? They won't be hurt. What's the route for the motorcade tomorrow? I don't know. Oh really? I swear it. They told us this morning that a final route will not be chosen until just before. I'm telling you the truth. You must not hurt my family. Well, now. That's just the sort of plan I expect from Ferguson. Here. That's a little voice transmitter. You put it on the dashboard so when Ferguson tells you which way to drive, I'll hear it as well. What are you going to do? Arranged a little surprise for the Ambassador, that's all. I can not do this. I will be accessory to murder. Your son's a really sweet kid. How old is he, six? Good morning, sir. Good morning. Come on, dear. You're not taking the child in the motorcade, are you? Why? Just odd. It's not my place, of course, but might not be so interesting for a child. You're quite right, but actually, we're dropping them off at a friend's. Of course, sir. We have plenty of time. Well you go ahead, I forgot to check for messages. Yes, sir. Dillon? Charlie. Get Toussaint to give you everything they have on the driver they've assigned me. He's nervous, I think we should find out why right away. Yeah, his family's gone. They own him. Interesting. Everything all right? Couldn't be a better. Grandfather, can we go to Euro Disney? Wouldn't you like to see a chateau fairy castle? I'd rather see Donald Duck. I do worry about the future sometimes. Take a seat. I think you two should have a little chat. Someone has your family? They said they are gonna kill 'em unless you help them. Who are they? I can't. I don't... Now, you listen to me. I will cancel that motorcade and announce that we've brought you in and you're cooperating in exchange for leniency. I don't think your family will last too long after that, do you? You can't do that. That would make you no better than them. Brigadier Ferguson would never agree to such a thing. He's a decent man. Exactly. He would not sentence my wife and children to die. That's right, he wouldn't. That's why I'm handling this. If I help you, you have to save them. Is that him? Yes. I know this man. If he thinks the operation has been a success, he'll let your family go. Now what did he say? Beyond that building over there. Up on the left. That's one of ours. Jesus Christ. Brigadier Charles Ferguson, a British civil servant was in a car that was hit by a small missile and it is reported that both he and his driver are dead. Back to our newsroom, this is Carrie O'Brian reporting. Congratulations, my friend. A job well done. Some civil servant. That old bastard's been after me on and off for a decade. Part one accomplished. Now on to part two. Ilya. Why don't you go see if the kitchen staff has anything nice to go with this champagne. You can talk in front of Ilya. I would trust him with my life. I would trust him with your life, too. Go on, Ilya. Royalty. What, the queen? Prince Charles? If the queen dies, Charles takes her place. If Charles dies now, the queen stays in place. Then who's the target? A target that will not only destroy the monarchy, but cause such an outrage against the IRA that peace will be forgotten and all hell will break loose. Please spare me the clever intricacies of your plan, Mr. Tayi. I'm just here to do the job. I repeat, the target? Two. The Royal princes. We're killing two children? We're blowing apart the United Kingdom. How are the obits? Most satisfactory. The Telegraph says I was a gentlemen, courageous, modest. What do you want? It's The Telegraph. Oh, shut up. Even The Guardian has nice things to say. The PM himself was lavish in his... What is it? Oh, sorry, sir. My father has taken a turn for the worst. They're going to try chemotherapy. I really ought to be home. I'd love to let you go, but... I understand. I promise you'll be on your way as soon as possible. Any word on that driver's family? They were released unharmed this morning. How long you gonna stay dead? The longer Engle thinks I'm dead, the more likely he is to reveal himself, perhaps. I have to go back to London tonight. Well, good luck to both of you. You're really quitting? Yup. Because you're in love. Because I lost my edge. Su Yin's ruined me. It's no line of work for anyone who thinks of anyone other than themselves. Good luck to you. I'm sorry I didn't give word right away, but the things were a bit hectic. It's just wonderful that you're all right, sir. Now you're gonna have to put up with me for a while longer. Thank you, Helen. Needless to say all, this is strictly confidential. As far as the rest of the world is concerned, Brigadier Ferguson is dead. Hi. I have some information for you. No, no, not over the phone. I'll come to your place. About six? Bye. I wish sometimes you'd ring. I wait for your calls. The flat is so empty since... I know, darling. You miss her so much. And I do think of you all the time. But you know how busy I am. Now, what do you have for me? Something big. Ferguson is alive. What about the news footage? I saw the car explode. There were only dummies in the car. It was remote controlled from the car in front. It was all a set-up. Why? I don't know. He's going back to Europe. Obviously he thinks something else is gonna happen. I'll try and get you more information. I don't give a damn what happens to them, you know? I used to but now. Go into the bedroom, Nigel. I'll be right there. He saw him in the flesh! You failed. The entire operation is in jeopardy. What is going on? That's what I intend to find out from the man who will know. Who is? Sean Dillon. You ever been to Venice? No. It's great. You know what? We'll go. Maybe after that, we'll fly to Ireland. That's no fun, you've been there already. This time, I'll be with you. You've been lonely, haven't you? We forgot ice cream. I'll get it. Be careful. Hurry back. Good evening, Sean. You oughta find yourself a hobby and get you off the streets. What's on your mind? I've heard the rumors of Ferguson's death were greatly exaggerated. They were. How much does he know? That you were behind it, that's it. Now, you listen to me. I got myself a big payday for arranging for you to blow up a car with a couple of dummies in it and I got out. For the love of a good woman. That's right. You oughta try it some time. One little piece of advice, Sean, and that's friendly advice. Stay out of it. What's about to happen will shake Britain. Hell, it'll shake the world. And if you try to stop me, if I even see you in the next few weeks, the next bullet will go through your shirt pocket, not into it. Thanks. But if I tried to stop you, I think I know where the next bullet would go. Thanks for the souvenir. Know what? When this is all over, we'll have a pint of Guinness and talk over old times, what do you think? No! Sean, I didn't mean to. Sean? How is she? Bad. I'm so sorry. Is there anything I can do? You have you own sorrows. Mr. Dillon? Would you like to see her for a moment? Excuse me. I'm sorry I did this to you. Dillon's out of the picture now. Ferguson doesn't know what's happening. It'll go ahead as planned. If you fail me again, you are a dead man. My operatives will see to that. If you kill one, I will send 10. If you kill 10, I will send 100. Before the numbers get too large, let's remember we're on the same side. Dillon. Please accept my condolences. Thank you. You okay? I'm all right. Engel knew you were alive. I suggest you find out how. Whatever he's planning he said it would shock the world. I'm back on the team. For revenge? Let's just say our interests coincide. Sean, wouldn't it be better if you took a break? Give yourself some time? Welcome back. How good is your inside source? Very close to the action. Can he keep tabs and Ferguson's activity? Absolutely. Good. I want everything he can get. If that costs me money, Dovotny will see to it. It costs no money, only my time. I see. So what do you do? Lie back and think of Russia? Yes. And you? You sleep only with beautiful women you love? Yes. Is that interesting? Of course. In my private life, that's what I do, too. Then we have more in common than we thought. And we don't have to waste time on anything other than business. How can I help? I want you to locate someone for me. His name is Danny Farmer, IRA. Best weapons man they have. He's so good he only surfaces every five years or so. The rest of the time, he's in deep cover. With the peace, I imagine he's retired. He'll be somewhere lenient. Sounds like the sort you'd be able to find yourself, given your connections. Yes, but I can't be seen to be looking for him. Dovotny will probably have a file on him. He has a daughter named Mary. All right. What else? The schedule of royal engagements for the next month. If Dillon's right and Engel does go to the East End for supplies, that's where we should be, too. I've pulled files on various likely types. I'm sure most of these gentlemen will be familiar to you. Plaskett. Strictly small town. Anderson? Hates the IRA. Cochran, he's an informant, isn't he? Yes. Engel would know that. Flood. We've been watching his casino for the last few years. Seems he's gone legit or become very careful. Got you. He'll still know everything that's stirring. Get Dillon to check on him. Did you know, sir, that Dillon is on the edge? That's where he does his best work. Have fun, sweetheart. Come on, Billy. You're very lucky, sir. So they tell me. Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen. I haven't heard from you regarding paying off your debt. Jack, times are tough. In the old days, when the Arabs came here dropping a 100 grand, 200 grand at time. It was a different story. I'm paying as much as I can. It's not enough, Harry. But what you going to do? Get blood out of stone? I can try. No, there's no need for strife. I have an alternative. I have money that needs to be processed. A casino is a logical place to do it. I have been legitimate four years now and I intend to stay that way. And I intend to pay my debts, too. But if you think I'm going to launder your dirty money, the answer's no. I have come out of the gutter. Now bug off. Jack? No offense. None taken. Look, here. My card for my funeral business. Give it to your next of kin. How you doing, my dear? Lost every hand. Nevermind, let's go home. Already? Can I stay until my luck turns? I'm tired, my dear. Let Billy play so we can get back the money. Oh, here you go. The house can't be lucky forever. That's very true. Harry. Ugh, this must be reunion night. Look, before you say anything, I am totally straight. If you've come to me for the sort of thing you used to ask me for, forget it. I'm here for information. Well go buy an encyclopedia. They come in those CD-what's its. You know, very easy to use I think. It's Engel. He's in the market for some supplies. Now you want me to grass? Look, I've got enough problems of my own, believe me. Like what? You don't wanna know. Try me, I'm a very curious guy. Why do you-- oh, I get it. One hand washes the other? Something like that. Jack Harvey was just here. Jesus, he give me the creeps. I think he must drink some of that formaldehyde he uses. He still number one in the East End? Yeah, the money he makes. He could be a king but no, he hides in that damn funeral parlor. So what's your problem? Well Jack bank rolled me in the old days and I'm paying him back but now, he wants to use my operation to launder his money. Or he hinted. Sort of hinted. I'll be in trouble soon. Here's what you do. You call him back, you say you'll cut him in for half of what he wants. What the hell do you care? He's not gonna skim enough to break you. You're crazy. And you be my eyes and ears and you funnel me some information. Make it enough, I'll make sure he goes away for 20 years, you can do whatever the fuck you want. You're not crazy. We have all our street informants out there, but it's quiet. The calm before the storm. What about the Ferguson leak? We think it was the French. Speaking of our Lord and master, it's time. The rather bland official report said that it was in the interest of national security that the public were led to believe you were being killed. Can you elaborate on that? The deception was to allow the government more time to ascertain who the terrorists were. Was the Prime Minister aware of this charade? The Prime Minister is aware of almost everything, Christopher. But wasn't this a cynical, manipulation of the media? Cynical, no. A manipulation, yes, and I must say it's a refreshing change to manipulate the media for a good cause rather than to be manipulated by them for no greater cause than to increase their circulation or ratings. Brigadier, unfortunately we're out of time. Thank you. Always a pleasure, Christopher. It's not often Christopher Pressman gets as good as he gives. Bernstein. I see. Thank you. It was the hospital. My father. I'm sorry. It's a hard world. You don't seem to mind too much that I'm not a beautiful woman. The change is as good as the rest. What's your story, comrade? You're an unlikely choice for all of this. Beautiful French girl. My mother was French. My father, American. They lived in New York. My father was hunted out of the States in the fifties by the House on American Activities Committee. He and my mother moved to Paris, then London. I grew up with the principles of the peoples' struggle. And like they say, true communism hasn't failed, it hasn't been tried yet. Sorry, when people talk ideology, my eyes glaze over. Can we talk business? What do you have for me? What else, I mean? A lead on farmer. He's in England. Sussex. We don't yet have the exact address. But we'll get it. It's a matter of days. Good. I'll need a pilot's license, too. Light aircraft. No problem. How about that arms dealer I asked you to check out? Man is an informer. As I thought. We can vouch for one your list. Jack Harvey. I've worked with Jack before. What's your connection? Dovotny's doing business with him. A certain amount of the Russian army's military supplies seem to be disappearing. There is such chaos that no one's noticing. And the proceeds are funding Alexander Korchov's Back To Basic campaign, right? Korchov is the only one who could build a Russia that would once again command respect. It's all right, comrade, calm down. I'm on your side. No, you're not. You don't believe in anything. You have nothing greater than yourself to live for. Any problems? Most of these items are in stock. One or two have to be special ordered. Two weeks at the most. Do you want me to work up a price for you? Yeah, just for the accounts. You're fair, I know that. Here's your down payment plus your five percent from the Joubert brothers. I had a social call from your friend, Dillon, and now he's active in London again. What do you mean? He's been seen hanging around Harry Flood's casino. And what the hell would Sean want from Harry Flood? You'll have to ask Harry that. I think I will. Thanks, Jack, I'll be in touch. I made the deal with Jack Harvey. He's happy. He's branching out to a lot of new stuff. I couldn't have asked for much. I couldn't ask too much but what I did pick up is he's getting stuff from the eastern block. Weapons. There's big money in that. Now what about Engel? What do you want me to do? Say, "Oh, by the way, Jack. "My friend, Dillon, wants to know if you're making "a deal with Engel." I don't care how you do it, just do it. What's in it for me if I make a link? You lead me to Engel, I'll give you police files on all Harvey's people. Drug dealers, pimps, arms handlers, and when he goes down, you'll have enough to keep him off your back forever. You can do all that? You give me Engel, I'll give you the world. Where's Bernstein? She had a message for me. She's taking a couple of days off. Very close to her father. Made me think about mine. Collected butterflies. I used to have a nightmare that they'd come off the wall, swarm all around us, and smother us all. Revenge. And you still believe the sins of our past catch up with us? Well, you don't believe that, do you? It's Flood. He's found Engel. If this works out, I'm gonna need some confidential police files. That would be highly irregular. Thanks for the hand. Mordecai, is that you? Mordecai, is that you? Dillon, I'm glad to see you. I bet you are. Look, I know we had an appointment, but... Did you kill Mordecai? It was either me or the fall. How did they get to you? Engel came here. I'm sorry, Sean, I really am. But now, I'm staying out of it. Look, if I say anything, they'll kill me. Sean, I can't say anything. Look, you killed Mordecai, all right, fair enough. But that's it. Look, Sean-- look, Sean, you're bluffing. I know this is your favorite part-- What the hell did you think you were doing? I was thinking that it would be good to catch Engel. Do you enjoy doing things like that? We've had Flood's lawyers all over the place. This is supposed to be a secret department. The PM himself has been on the phone this morning. Well it's a good thing I don't have a written contract. Well, was it worth it? What did you find out? He's got the goods on the premises, including Semtex. At some point, Engel's gotta show up. Did he go ahead knowing you're alive and you're on to him? Yes, he doesn't have enough time to start with another dealer. Flood could've bled to death. Maybe. It would have been murder. He pays me to murder people! That's enough! What's done is done. Harvey's place is already under surveillance. We go ahead with the raid first thing in the morning. No! We keep it under surveillance. If Engel shows up, then we move in. My objective is to stop terrorism. If we get the good whole of Harvey's-- Yeah and 50 pounds of Semtex will get the PM off your back. That's not fair. That's very fair, but that's not my only thought. We go ahead with the raid. I thought the objective was to get Engel? Not at any price. I picked you because you're the same breed as Engel. And when I don't need you, you are gone. But never anywhere down the line, will I let you call the shots. That's my job. Do we understand each other? We always have. Sean. What? Get some help. Jack Harvery. There's a raid scheduled for your place tomorrow morning. You're already under surveillance. You be quiet. Don't move everything or they'll know you were tipped off so let 'em find something. It doesn't matter who I am. Someday I might need a favor, then we'll meet. Coming! Come on in, Charlie. What, Bernstein's not with you? No, I didn't want her here. From the look on your face, it doesn't seem like the raid on Jack Harvey's place went as planned. I'll let you get away with that once, on account of your age. You tipped him off, didn't you? Maybe. We found just enough to make it plausible, not enough to nail him. Very smart, that. You are off the case. That won't stop me. I know it won't. I hope you find Engel and kill him. If I didn't hope that, you'd have already been arrested. For what? For whatever reason I damn well please. I am so sick of your goddamn threats. You do what you need to, but I tell you this, if you interfere with our efforts for any reason at all, I'll give the order to have you killed. Myself. Do you doubt that I would do it? No. Not in a million years. I'll leave you the way you'll always be, Dillon. Alone. Another shot. Start again, George. Why don't you watch where you're going? What did you say? I said, why don't you watch yourself? Maybe you should watch yourself. Leave it. No harm done, eh? Why are you telling me to leave it? Why aren't you telling him to leave it? 'Cause if you don't, it's yourself we'll be carrying out. You think I'm afraid of this puxy bastard? Forget it. Enough, Sean. Please. I'm sorry. He's a bully, I'll take care of him. Dillon? Yeah? Sean. I didn't mean to hurt the woman. It was an accident. I don't wanna hear any excuses from you. I just wanted to say I'm sorry. It's nothing I wanted. She'd be alive if it weren't for you. She'd also be alive if she hadn't fallen in love with the wrong man. For Christ sakes, Sean, it just happened. Things happen. Yeah. Well I'm coming for you. Then one of us will be dead soon and I wonder which one. On the conclusion of "Midnight Man." Goes under the name of Peter Mcintosh. He's after the highest tech rifle there is. I think the hit is a local one. Just do me one favor. Kill Sean Dillon. Don't worry. That was already part of the plan. Danny, if that's you, that's no way to greet a friend. You've been telling tales out of school. And I wonder who you've been telling 'em to. I'll take full-- So what? Don't turn your bitterness on me, Sean. I don't think you have so many friends you can afford to lose one. Don't get yourself killed now that I've found you. Mary's taking a liking to you. If you harm her, I'll never forgive you. I wouldn't, Danny. This deed must not be traced back to me. Of course. Therefore, any direct links-- Must be eliminated. What do I have you want? An act of terrorism is planned to take place in England. I have no interest in terrorists. You British, you are the terrorists. What about the queen? At Windsor. No official engagements. That's it, then, it's Charles. What the Syrians do is their business. You expect me to shed tears for bonnie Prince Charlie? There's a lock onto the target for anything up to two miles. The hit is on Prince Charles tomorrow. High powered rifle. All right. What else do you know? The rifle. There's a tiny metal pellet that Engel's planning to plant on the target somehow. Perfect. Someone once said, "If a madman who doesn't mind dying "wants to kill someone, there's no way of stopping him." Engel's not after Charles, he's gonna try to kill the boys. Get a squad over there now! Bingo.
