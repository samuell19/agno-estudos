Starring KNIFE IN THE WATER Screenplay Music Cameraman Photography Directed by ...Three, four! Forward. Hands under lips. Head and cap up - and down. One, two... They're out early. One, two... Left, turn, straight... Left, turn, straight... You didn't turn out the lights. One last time round the room. One, two, three, four... Little jerk! ...The tempo is distinctly relaxing... If you'd been standing half a mile further up, ...there'd be a corpse on the road. You get me? It was a miracle I stopped in time! I mean, if you'd been driving, you'd have... No You'd have just stopped... ...and invited this ass-hole in. I'm very sorry. Forgive me, darling. I'm most terribly sorry. Do get in, please. Do you prefer the front or the back? Here. Here's a cushion, blanket. Maybe you'll manage to get some sleep? We'll do our best not to disturb you. We won't talk. - Good morning... - Sorry, I'll switch it off. - ...the time is... - There. It's Sunday. There are no trucks on Sunday. And well, it's such a nice car... ...I thought maybe it was from an embassy. Embassies, they tend to stop. I didn't know it was private. Or maybe the embassy chauffeur got the car for a Sunday out? The word is "driver", not "chauffeur". I've an eye for detail. Don't miss much. The number-plate's Polish. Anyway, do you look like an embassy chau... ...driver? There are a few decent cars in private hands these days. A 404, that's about the max. Though I did see a 190 SL in Warsaw. And two Jaguars. Shit. Excuse me. It's just we're hitting 80 mph and you're so... My husband's a pretty good driver. - Shit. - Where are you headed? - What about you? - Not far to go. The Marina. Good enough. Pity I can't say this car took me all the way from Warsaw. And if I hadn't stopped? There'd be a corpse on the road. What is it, a kind of sport? Life would be boring otherwise, wouldn't it? How old are you? I'd have run over a kid and taken the rap for an adult. Thank you. Where? Over there. The keys. - Put the sack down. - Where? Here? I'll pass it to you. Club boat? No, ours. I'll be off then. Hey! - What?! - Come on up I've a long way to go yet. Come on up I've got something to tell you. - What? - You know what... The bilge is full of water. - Well, bail it out. - Well, what? - I'll give you some advice. - You could do it yourself. I said: Bail it out. With other cars, get off the road. - I know. Poor brakes. - And nerves. I'll be straight with you. I always do it that way. It's just the others pull up way ahead. And then don't take you. - I wanted to scare you. - Shit! Excuse me. You sure managed that. - I'm off. - Unmoor the tender, would you? - Here? - Yes. Never been on the water? No I'm a hiker. In that case, it'll be like discovering America. I like walking. You know, your own legs. You rely on yourself. I'll try some other time. - We're just out for a day. - Yeah? Me too. - You're leaving the wipers? - They won't get stolen here. Anyway, I can always replace them. - Can you do me a favor? - Well? How long are you staying on the water? Till dawn. - So could I? - Well? Come at dawn, and get a ride back? For a minute I thought a sailor had been born. So you need an extra hand. We'll manage. I'm off. You wouldn't have jumped out of the way. I knew you'd stop. You're a kid, but I admire you. Hey! I knew you'd call me. - No way. - I know what you're thinking. - Oh yeah? - You want to play on. Get real. Me play with a kid like you? You called me back. Take your shoes off, and climb on board. - Cast off the bow-line. - Casting off. Push bow to port. Bow to port. Ready about. On the water, you need to have reflexes. Let me. I'll bail it out. And discipline. When I was an apprentice helmsman, we had a bosun... Krystyna, what was his name? The guy with the willow. He'd say: See that willow? It was an oak. If the bosun says it's a willow, it's a willow. - "To the willow, quick march!" - Shit. Excuse me. So much water in there. We'd sit on that willow maybe an hour at a time. On that oak, ...willow, for us. - And he made us go "cuckoo" - Made you do what? Make a cuckoo sound. Like the bird. And you cuckooed. He wasn't all that smart... ...but he turned us into men. - Are we moving? - Well, spit. In the water. What for? We're moving! - You could also dip your foot. - You could. - But you wouldn't. - Why not? It's not a salt bath. I think I forgot the salt. No, I didn't. Here it is. - Tribute to your wife? - What? - The name. - Yes. But I forgot the gherkins. The wife's name is Christine? Krystyna. Hear that? Yes. You haven't lost the keys? No They're here. - Where? - Here On the table. Help yourselves. I don't know if you like, ...I've got a radish. Great idea! We should have thought of it before. I always say, more vegetables, vitamins. - Here. - Thanks I've got one. Why do you carry that dagger? It's useful. Especially in the forest. It's no use on the water, but... ...it's handy if you're... ...tearing through the undergrowth. Because sailing, on water... ...is nothing, really. It's when you head out on your own... ...that you need a knife. That's how it is, in life. You're such a kid. It's easy to cut yourself. Ever happened to you? Got to be careful. You can never be sure. There was a sailor once... ...wanted to show off in company. Others were more fun. Told jokes. Showed card tricks. And this sailor suddenly... ...took a couple of empty bottles, ...broke them against the floor, ...took off his shoes and got on the table. You're bored. Coil the bow-line. Into a sun shape. If you show me how... Got to be at the helm. You can't replace me. - You need to know how. - I can learn. Head for that buoy. OK. It's not here you need it, it's here. Go on, coil up that line. What's with all this ordering about? With two on board, one's the captain. Or corporal. - You served in the army? - No. I was at university. So what do you do now? You a gynecologist? I write. Song lyrics? - Read the "Sports Courier"? - No. Ready about. Let fly portjib-sheet. Haul in starboard jib-sheet. What's up? Throw me my rucksack, would you? I'm going. I've had enough. I'm a hiker, not a roustabout. You're a wimp. Man, there are 120 lakes here. Why go this way? Why? Krystyna, give the man his rucksack. I'll manage. - We'll return another way. - Not with me, though. You chicken out easily. I don't like being made a clown. Go on, take the helm. I wasn't talking to you, madam. You get in, please! I'll manage! Give me the line! No no no. Get in, both of you. - Get in! - Give me the line! Don't be crazy! Get to the helm, or we'll keel over! Twelve o'clock. Twelve ten. He hasn't got a watch. - What are you cooking? - What? Compass. It's big. No use for hitch-hiking. No whistling on board. Why not? Sailing boat rules. A seaman would be made to climb the mast for that. A deck-hand wouldn't, of course. You want me to cuckoo? - I ought to kick your ass! - Andrzej, let's go back. - I'm to change route for him? - Can't get me up here. Maybe I should give him a gold watch as well? Andrzej, please. OK. Give me the helm. - Going about! - Ready about! - Let out portjib-sheet! - Portjib-sheet let out! - Haul in starboard jib-sheet! - Starboard jib-sheet hauled in! Amen. - Where are my shoes? - Where you left them. Rub my back. - Ass. - Who? Cloud's like a donkey. True. On the left there, ...there's another one. It's breaking up. A storm's brewing. Incredible. How can you tell? In your bones? We'll manage to get a swim before it starts. But we're not moving at all. The wind's died down. What's going to happen now? Lunch. I could tell by my stomach. Do we get a finger-bowl? Your patent? You think it's unnecessary? Hold it without it. You split the soup, not me! Sit down. Why aren't you eating? I want to reach the shore. Is there no way? - We've got oars. - Where? In the forepeak. But we're having lunch. Sailing's for adults. When there's wind, you move. - When there isn't, you don't. - Waste of time. - What would you be doing now? - Walking. What for? For the sake of walking. You wouldn't understand. You just walk. Please quit fooling. Eat up. Could you steer right, please? Did I hear an order? - Our guest wants new bearings. - I want to sail shoreward. - There's a shore there too. - At least here it's visible. - Too shallow. - So? We'll crash if we row. Andrzej, let's move. We'll find a way through. Why did he get on the table? Who? The bosun. Which one? The one who broke the bottles. It wasn't a bosun. A sailor. He jumped on them from the table. Blood squirted all the way to the ceiling. - And? - Well, he was a tough guy. Krystyna, take a look. See? Listen. - Well? What's up? - Take off your bib. - Jump! - No! Dive in and get the oar. - I can't swim! - Don't bull-shit me. I can't swim. Want me to drown? - Jump. - Leave him alone. The water it's just... Pass me the crocodile. You're ruining the deck. With feeling, though. If you fell in the water, ...I reckon you'd swim. Try me. Andrzej! The crocodile's blowing bubbles! I was joking. Andrzej! Take the flippers OK? OK? There's a first aid kit below. Put a dressing on your hand. Want me to help you? Put her in irons! Let out the sail! Krystyna! Got a fright, huh? I worked it out in the end. Except for the wind. You need to look at these strings. Want to try leaning out? Show what you can do. - I'm to lean out overboard? - Yes. You need a bit of courage. We're moving! You sail for the sake of sailing. You walk. Knife! Knife! Here. Goddamnit! I said it was too shallow. Well you were at the helm. - Let's try pushing. - Easy now. Wind's died down again. Well? What's up? It's deep on that side. - Will we manage? - Give me the oar. Not that one. The long one. Put it up. Give me the oar. Try again. Get in. - Undo it here. - Let me see. Krystyna. Ladies and gentlemen! The Turk's attacking! He lands a left hook in Molik's stomach... ...but Molik hits back at once with a blow to the forearm. The Turk's all shaken up, ladies and gentlemen. He'll be a bit less arrogant now. And indeed he is, ladies and gentlemen. History repeats itself... Don't turn round, please. ...if I might just mention the battle of Vienna... ...in which perhaps some ancestor of our Molik... ...was as effective in beating the forebear of Bel Hassan... ...as his descendant is today in beating his ancestor. I mean his descendant. The Turk's, that is. Sorry I'm confused, but this really is... ...an emotional sight. Our brave Molik, ladies and gentlemen! Putting on a show of such wonderful legwork! See those legs in action, ladies and gentlemen... Unbelievable. Like a ballerina. And right now all of Poland is looking at those legs... ...and wishing Molik a repeat of the success of brilliant... ...King Jan Sobieski, who beat the faceless. I mean, faithless. Get him, Molik! Our wishes go with your blows. Boy, have I been talking! Put out some glasses, Krystyna. His straight left hits Molik's jaw. Now a straight right... straight left... - Molik's on the boards... - Medicine. They're cheering Hassan... Typical southerners... No sense of fair play. He's not been KO'd, of course. Our boy just slipped. To all at sea. But the ref's started counting, ladies and gentlemen. In English, ladies and gentlemen. He's neutral. Dutch. Three, four... How long is he going to count like that? We'll blow up the Il-los. ...Now, the Pole's sitting up Turkish style... ...and getting up! As I said, there's no knock-out... ...just Molik's tactical maneuver. He's come up rested, with restored energy... ...as he frequently does, ladies and gentlemen... - Race you. - OK. Wait! ...Because he rested too long. The fight is on again! Molik's stalking his prey again... - Ready? - Ready. Will it work out OK for him again? Molik takes a huge swing... This could finish the Turk... Yes, he goes for it! But the Turk's no wilting flower either. He's good at dodging. And he's just dodged. Molik follows up and they're wrapped in a clinch! Molik's a clinch expert. He sticks to someone... ...no way can you unstick him. It's 'break!', in English, but Molik's English is poor. Anyway, he's resting. They've broken up! They're back together. The Turk's losing strength. No, he's holding on. Molik too He's holding on to the Turk. It's break again. Ready! Another dickhead they sent to Ankara. We've no-one better in welterweight. It's the idiot commentator I'm talking about. - Do you play bridge? - Yes. Pity. - No cards? - No fourth player. What about a dummy? The handicapped aren't allowed on board. ...the Polish community supporting our great boys. Here's me chatting, while half the first round's gone by. Here you go. ...Excuse me, that was the whole round. Now a minute's break. The cornestants are in their contests, sorry, contestants... ...are in their corners. Molik's sitting calmly. He's breathing freely. Rosolowski, the coach is whispering in his ear. He's obviously giving a few foolproof tips... Molik's smiling... Here. Real ones. He's sure of victory. Let's look at his opponent! He's talking with his coach too. But nervously. You start. - I've never played this. - Pick-up sticks. Sailor's game. - You go first. - You start, Krystyna. - No, you go ahead. - Let's get on with it. We pull one each. If you joggle, you give a forfeit. "Joggle"? That's kid's language. ...must be incredibly resistant to blows. I wonder if any of our older listeners... ...remember the famous Zenek Krepaczewski... So you're not to move them, right? Here. Had a dragon's appetite. Talking of food, Turkish cooking is very spicy. Full of paprika... It's straightforward. ...the proverbial Turkish pepper. But never mind that, we're about to see... ...round two of this welterweight match... ...between our Maciek Molik and the Turk... What's his name... Kaz, did you move my notes? Here This should work. - Yes, yes. - Forfeit. ...must have momentarily got caught up in thought... ...and dropped his guard. The Turk seized the chance... ...to lay him a left hook. You start, Krystyna. Thank you ...he drives Molik into a corner... - My turn. - Right. ...now he's chasing him around the ring. He's chasing, but he can't catch up with him. I wish the same could be said of our cyclists! Good wisecrack, eh? Luckily, the crisis is over. Molik's back in business, dancing freely... With feeling. Right, with feeling. ...Oh how he dances! It's indescribable. This has got to be seen... Shit. Sorry. ...They're still checking each other out. Like two surgeons before the decisive cut... But let's get to that cut, because time's running out! Our man has still failed to gain the advantage. You start. He outclasses his opponent, just the way he stands. But the Turk's no wimp either. You could say he's a real Turkish Janissary. Molik's about to attack. You can tell from his face. But he's not attacking. Should have picked here. The Turk can't take the stress. He's going forward. Molik's going back. Now it's Molik forward, the Turk back. Tough game, boxing. Man's game. No room for sentiment. I mention this in view of... ...the debate about its alleged harmful effects... ...and the opinion that it shouldn't be taught... - What was that? - Forfeit ...when it's due to the excellent training by... ...coach Rosolowski that Molik now has a chance... ...a great chance... ...to get two more points for his country. And yes, the coach has just shouted 'Forward!'... Molik obeys the call without hesitation! Damn... He's gone straight into the Turk's right fist. What am I to do with the forfeit I have in my hand? The captain must be better than his crew. What am I to do with the forfeit I have in my hand? Sing. ...he's just laid out in the middle of the ring... Don't pretend you won't enjoy it. What shall I sing? No need to be coy about your music theory lessons. The piece you're always humming... Don't sing that. That's the one. Our guest asked me to sing it. The captain's authority doesn't extend to repertoire. Wait, wait! ...We're all upset by Molik's defeat, ...but nobody seriously thought he could... - Go on, please sing. - No, please listen. - No, sing. - No please listen. ...be South-East European champion. A frequent Olympic fighter for Turkey... Let's hope this defeat... Go ahead. Don't speak, don't speak, don't talk Don't... I can't. - Please sing. - I can't do it. You won't get the forfeit, then. Oh all right. Don't speak, don't speak, don't talk Don't look, don't look, Let me walk Our words have dried up, our moon and sun Our feelings have simply gone Don't lie, don't lie, don't beg me You know that nothing remains Though there's emptiness, you don't need me We're not happy our love's not the same So don't speak, don't speak, don't talk Night and day are no longer a blur You're back to the regular clock You're not the guy you were You're not the guy you were - I can't remember the rest. - That song. A stupid pop-song. - But... - Who could have KO'd Molik? Here you are. What am I to do with the forfeit I have in my hand? Say a poem. I hear a mosquito's lament. Maybe you, mother I only know bits of it. How could Molik let himself be KO'd like that? Night. - Last drops of fuel in the lamp. - What? I hear a mosquito's lament. Maybe you, mother, are those few stars in the firmament Or a white sail on the lake Or a wave on the sloping sands Maybe the stardust on this page was sprinkled with your hands? Or maybe you're the midday hour? The buzz of bees in August's golden rooms? Yesterday, I found a hairpin in the reeds Yours, I presume? - There! - Bravo, bravo! You've got an excellent memory. Switch on the radio if you like. Look, this is how it should be done. I knew a guy who did it the way I did. He was a genius at the game. Zdzisio Majzner, his name was. Had a huge boat. Sixty yards of sail. He was a great guy. Had a senior helmsman's license. Actually, it was false. But he passed the test later. He was a great guy. Always said. Pick-up sticks. They're not just bits of wood. They're an organism. - What's the matter? - I didn't say anything. But our guest doesn't know this. He's asleep. Asleep? I guess he was tired. Probably slept in the forest yesterday. He said it's just for one day. What did you invite him for? You sure he's not pretending to sleep? Hey! Hey! What time shall I set the alarm for? Five. - Earlier than that. - Is he really asleep? Five will do. The case is at nine. I heard you going out. You weren't asleep? I sleep watchfully. I couldn't sleep. Close atmosphere. It had rained, but it was still close. When do we sail? The halyard's broken. We have to fit a new one. Got to bail out the water too. Go and get some sleep. Shall I bail out the water? Early birds. I thought we were supposed to get up at five. - We're fitting the halyard. - So I see. Well done. I didn't sleep a wink. What am I to do with the rope that I have in my hand? Sit at the helm. - Haul the anchor. - What? Pull up the anchor. Put it in the forepeak. Go down there now. What for? Please go down to the forepeak. Forepeak gone down. - You see the chest? - Chest seen. Quit clowning. We'll be in port soon Quit playing captain. There are rags inside. Found them? That's not all. There's a pall. - Deck needs scrubbing. - I could do that. Stay at the helm, OK? You got a schooling there It'll be useful to you. But all in all you had a good time, huh? The main thing is, we part as friends. - Say something nice to him. - Just head for that buoy. Where's my knife? What's happened to my knife? Calm down. Nothing goes missing on my yacht. I'm not saying it's missing, I'm asking, where is it? In my pocket. Why did you hide it? What do you think? I was afraid of you? If I'd wanted to do something, ...I'd have managed without the knife. I'd like it back now. Take it. Please give me back the knife. Come on, give it back! Jump! Here's another one. Take it! He's not coming up. You hear me?! He's not coming up! Calm down. He can swim. - He said he couldn't. - He was lying! Swim to the right! To the right! OK! Here! He's probably grabbed the buoy! - He's not there! - Look round the other side! He's not there! You've drowned a man. You hear? - What was his name? - You've drowned a man. - He must come up in the end! - He couldn't swim! He lied! - He didn't bathe once. - Even a drowned man comes up! - How deep is it around here? - Thirty feet. Maybe less. - It's deeper than that. - So what am I to do? Jump in again. We've got to shout. Call the police. Why? We don't know who he was. Will they save him? See, you're admitting he's drowned. You've drowned a kid. This can't be undone. You've killed him! Quit shouting! Leave it! - You're a murderer. - Shut up. You're scared already. Shaking. You're not even trying to play it cool. Tough guy. You know what you are? A poseur, a fraud. Showing off in front of a boy. A kid. That's why you took him, to show off. - You're a clown! - And you're hysterical! - I'm your wife. - Otherwise you'd be a slut! You're just vulgar! I hate you! Go on. Jump, and swim. I hate you. - I can't bear to look at you. - So don't look. Jump and swim to the shore. You think I'm afraid of the police? Cretin. I want to puke. Fraud! You're posing right now! You'll be right back, I know you! You hear? You'll be right back. So you do know how to swim. Andrzej! I didn't hear anything. My teeth were chattering. Andrzej, come back! Maybe we should call out, both of us. - Andrzej! - Andrzej come back! Go down to the galley. Have some brandy. - I'll get my things and swim. - Haven't you caused enough... - ...trouble for one day? - I really couldn't hear. My teeth were rattling. Couldn't hear anything. If I'd known, I'd never have let this happen. Let what happen? Well, what happened. - You. - Shit. You're just the same. Except he's twice as old and strong, - ...and clever. - What do you know? Cafes, the yacht. The car. You've probably got a four-room apartment. - What do you know about life? - About life? You mean about yourself. Don't tell me. You live four to a room in a student hostel. - Six. - I've been through that. Haven't forgotten yet. He's been through it too. You're no better than he is. Understand? He was like you. You want to be like him. You will be. - If you have the gumption. - You're wrong. Six to a room. You want to sleep, the others are playing bridge. You want to study, the others want to sleep. A small grant to pay for the refectory and cigarettes. Kissing at the front door. In winter-time, it's too cold even to undo her blouse. Is that all? Anything else you'd like? Parent's death? Sister with TB? No. Are they alive? Divorced. Re-married. Any brothers or sisters? No. Parents help out? Father sends me something sometimes. Take this off. You'll catch cold. What's going on? - See? You're a kid. - What? I'm sorry. Don't be silly. It's Monday. Trucks? Plenty of them. Supplies are on the move. Monday's the best day. Are you ready? Fend off? Right. Fending off. They've stolen the wipers. You didn't hear the shouting? Who was shouting? I was shouting after you. Did you go to the police? Naked? At night?! You knew I couldn't get in the car. - You could've hurried up. - You could've broken in. Are we going home? We're going to the police. To report the wipers? Are you scared? - Are you scared? - No. - You are. - I'm telling you, I'm not. You're not afraid? I am. - We're turning back. - What? Don't go to the police. You're scared. That's enough. But you're safe. They won't hold anything against you. You'll just take the car and go home. He was there behind the buoy. He dived as I was searching. You were far away when he re-surfaced. We called out together. You didn't hear? How could I have done? I was doing the crawl. Anyway, don't bull-shit me. You made it all up. You think this way you can save me. You'll tell me a pack of lies. I'll pretend I believe you. We'll go back home. And then it'll be in the papers: "19-year-old left home. Missing." And we'll be going pale in company. No, you made it up. Gives you another chance to preach. I took a good look under that buoy. He drowned. He certainly didn't. I even managed to be unfaithful to you with him. I'm afraid? You're the one who's afraid. So afraid, you don't know what you're saying. By the way... ...I meant to ask you, you never finished that story. - What story? - Why have we stopped? I'm trying to believe what you said. Why would you try to convince me you did it with that kid? A stupid joke. Sorry. I won't joke any more. You're saying sorry? It was my fault. Andrzej, why did that guy jump on the bottles? What's up now? You didn't finish the story. Oh, that's just nonsense. One and two and left and right and... Which way are we going? - He was too sure of himself. - Who? The sailor. He'd done the trick many times. He was stoker on a ship. His soles were hardened... ...from walking on embers. But he had a year's break. His feet softened up. He hadn't realized. He didn't jump any more after that? I don't know what happened to him.
