PIECE OF LAND I suppose it's part of your daily routine... looking out of the window. To start the morning, definitely. Before breakfast, before work. You sit here. And evenings, too. Because whenever you come into the kitchen, you can't help but look out there. And sometimes... I notice, if there isn't much to do or if I'm taking a break, as paint is being mixed or something, you stare outside for ages and don't even notice you looked outside. Then I ask myself, what was it I just saw? There hasn't been any great change. I find this an interesting state: Not being able to remember what you were just thinking, nor what precisely you were looking at in this landscape. It's like if you sometimes think of people that you're fond of and whose faces you've studied, but can't quite remember what they look like. Yes, maybe it's a bit like that. And I suppose people here have better learned how to be alone, I'm often struck by this. Because of the space and how far apart houses are. Villages, too. Other places are much more densely populated. I find that also... Particularly with the wind. I mean, if you consider how you're alone, or if I am absolutely alone here and the wind blows past, you have a very different sense of things. You were telling me about a visitor who once lived here. Yes I was here... and someone arrived from Baden-Württemberg. He'd heard, in distant Baden-Württemberg, that this apartment block was being demolished. And it was his wish to come to this place where he'd grown up. His family had moved in here in 1965, when it had just been built. And he actually lived in this apartment, on this floor, on the other side. And he was... He must have had great memories, he ran around like a little boy: "Exactly, we used to sit here, my sister would sleep here..." He described it all, and was very grateful the building was no longer being demolished, and something new was being developed, saying... it had been very special for him, growing up here. I found that lovely. Because, if you came here, where all the rooms were wallpapered, you would go into the rooms and get a good idea of who'd lived here, what took place, how they got on with the neighbours: If you compared the wallpaper over there, you saw tastes differed greatly. All that. So when you first entered this building, you were surrounded by stories... or how you imagined the stories of things that took place here. I remember... I liked to sit on the harvest cart in summer. The grey horse's hooves trod softly into the summer path that led down to the lake. The refugee women talked around the village pump after work in the fields. War's end was close. A little later, harvesting the fields between Berlin and the Baltic, my schoolmates and I filled large baskets with potatoes. The earth smelt good. Many farming families had fled villages for the West. Those that remain worked in agricultural production co-operatives. In the evening, potato fires blazed on the plain. I saw the seascapes and the landscapes of the painter Caspar David Friedrich. I loved the high skies: They were reachable. And so I came to the Uckermark between Berlin and Stettin. My neighbours were born here. For years, people have been leaving this already sparsely populated area. My neighbours have stayed. Sing a song, Leonie. It'd be fun. Go on, sing. No? Who is the head of the family? You always say, I'm the head. But I'm always kept down by the women. "I'm the head of the family. The wife says, this is to be done." And... - No, it's not like that. If you're the head, would you tell us everyones names, please? Well, this is my mama, Mrs Helga. Then comes my daughter, Katrin. Then my son... Manni. What about her? - There's the granddaughter... Leonie. And my love... Ines. Come here, come here. Yes... Helga, your mother told me she transferred all of this to you, her farming successor in Herrenstein. That's true and correct. It's... it's my farm yard, to put it plainly. But you never... it never crossed your mind to sell the place? - No. Never. Why not? Everyone else, or many have. - Many, yes, right. The land's gone, And who knows how times will change? Maybe one day you'll say, I'm near retirement, I'd like to be a hobby-farmer. But you've nowhere to start. And then, you have children, grandchildren. Who knows what they'll want to do? Maybe one of them will somehow think: Why not, I'll try to earn money doing this or this... in terms of farming. Go organic, say. But the land is gone. And simple folk can't buy it anymore. A simple man can sell and earn well that way. Then he spends it fast and it's all gone. So it doesn't cross my mind to sell the land. So a farmer never sells? - Not normally, no. Not really. We saw... - What's gone is gone for good. And I myself believe anyone who farms organically will manage all right. But there's so much more work involved, that's the thing. More mechanical work. The others take their sprayers, it's all done in a flash, costs nothing more than petrol and poison. The poison costs a bit, sure, but not as much as a land-worker. You have to employ more people. If you farm organically, you need more people. And also... you have to get your hands dirty at times, too. And whether it's profitable... It all has to be paid for... And Germans, people in general, haven't got used to this, yet. Paying more. And many people just can't, that's the other thing. If everyone had money, all bought organic, that would be ideal. But as things are... people look for what's going cheap and just buy that. I remember the monoculture fields of German Democratic Republic agriculture. "Your view of the landscape is always your view of the world," said a friend to me. Now the large-scale wanting of rape and maize has returned. The highly subsidised energy crop is a money-maker. Investors from elsewhere buy up land at enormous prices here in the Uckermark. They have it managed like huge industrial premises. The fields can scarcely recover. Humus, the sensitive upper soil layer and basis of human fife, is being eroded. Only ten percent of agricultural land is farmed organically. Well, Wilmersdorf is over there. Afrika's over there. It's really called that, the hamlet over there... It is called Afrika. And over there is Gerswalde... and Flieth. This here is... a corner that, particularly over there as you can see from the hills is among the steepest we have around here. It's a challenge to get up here with the tractor. And your neighbours, which are the ones who farm? In Flieth there's a furniture producer, then there's another new neighbour, who trades remaining items. And these figures... have more or less divided up this land between them, you might say. Before the war it was originally one estate, back then. There was a nobleman who owned the estate, a certain... von Arnim, who also had an outlying estate with a tenant farmer on it. And there were old-time farmers who'd always farmed here in the village. And the land here, they divided up, it was theirs. Their holdings varied from one to thirty hectares. Then came war, the nobles were driven out. The land was repopulated with people who came here from eastern German territories. And... little by little, this land was re-appropriated. Either by the GDR, back then... or later, after the Wall fell. It's to do with the legal situation governing land reform. This meant that in this area here, three quarters of land belonged to the state's Trust Agency. And then it was privatised over the years. Do you remember what the Uckermark looked like when you first came here? Yes, I remember the first time I drove down the road here from Temmen to Stegelitz. Via Afrika down there. - Right. Via Afrika. The trees had been freshly planted. By now they're twenty years old... I thought to myself, you've seen this before. I couldn't exactly say where from, but it seemed incredibly familiar to me. And I felt a very strong wish to stay here in that instant. And it's great that this actually came true. You knew tram the start you wanted to farm organically? Yes. I took that decision back when I was studying. For one year I worked on a very intensive farm. The specialised crops were hop and cereal. Every second days in the summer you'd drive across the fields with the sprayer. And I'd always found fascinating the idea of organic farming: That it's possible... to farm using natural processes without introducing chemicals into things. Understanding that is still the greatest challenge for me. It functions, but it's disproportionately more difficult. What we've been doing here for 20 years is learning the hard way, but you notice, it functions, it can be done. It's completely fascinating as it's a form of agriculture that takes its lead from traditional farming, but actually... there's so much you can find in nature and integrate into farming, be it sowing certain crops together, be it working with certain species or procedural techniques... And there's understanding the land itself, how varied the soils are. That's what most fascinates me: That it's an ongoing cognitive process that you integrate into the way you farm. Something has still remained here of that which I recall: That alfalfa is growing there is something that is important and good... in a place where sheep graze. Alfalfa is a plant native to the Uckermark that can survive aridity, and indeed sends deep roots down into the earth and thereby, in the way of steppe flora, taps into deep water supplies and nutrients. It has so many good characteristics. As a leguminous plant, it's capable of binding atmospheric nitrogen using nodule bacteria of the rhizobi genus. That is to say, nature has developed so this plant brings atmospheric nitrogen into the earth. Furthermore, it has this blossom... that makes for lovely honey, it has blossom that indeed attracts the bees. So clover or alfalfa honey was one of the important honey sources. Then furthermore, these alfalfa fields containing protein-rich fodder were home to mice, the large striped field mice, who would dig deep into the earth. They also came from the steppe. So these were habitats that have now actually vanished. But fortunately, in organic farming, the natural supply of nitrogen uses clover, alfalfa and a few other plants... That which is actually afforded there, that which is proper to it. An agro-industrial farm er will not plant them at all. And it is in these alfalfa fields that are home to mice that lesser-spotted eagles find nourishment, as they hunt on foot. On a maize field or on a rape field, a lesser-spotted eagle cannot possibly live. It's simple: farm organically and the eagle thrives, farm industrially and it goes extinct. There's so much to say. The sheep there, they really fascinated me. When I was the sheep boy, the Schaf-Michel, the school day would end at noon at the village school and I... There were no computers back then. My mother, Käthe, would always cook lunch, then I'd go out onto the fields with the herd of sheep and my dog, a Hungarian sheepdog. He was a very clever animal and had seen a great deal in life. My father had been given him. So the dog and I would go out alone onto the fields with the herd and watch birds. But then the dog grew very old and finally died. So I didn't have a dog... who'd been trained to herd sheep. He wouldn't bite sheep. He'd calmly be at their knees, licking them more than anything, and he'd have the herd under control. So then I had a problem. The dog would run in circles around the herd to guide it. So what were we to do? And that's when I learned to bark like a dog. Then I read something else in a book by Martin Andersen Nexø: Pelle the Conqueror, which I think was on the school syllabus: In it it said that Pelle the shepherd always had his hands in his pockets and was indeed too idle to brush away a fly should one happen to land on his ear. So he looked to see what the sheep do, or the cows or the horses. And he saw them waggle their ears. So then Pelle learned to waggle his ears. That impressed me massively, I thought: I must myself learn to waggle my ears so as to be able to do something that people can no longer do. And so, while watching the sheep, I learnt to waggle my ears and to bark. I suppose I'll have to waggle them now. There. But the true art... and few can do it, is being able to waggle them separately. So now I'll have to... Doing both simultaneously is one thing, and is rare enough, but that I can do one or the other independently, that's the true art. Few have mastered that. Come over here! Come over here! Come, come. Come, come. My name's Marko Hönicke, I'm from the village of Kaakstedt in the Uckermark. And... what have you worked at and studied? I was in financial management and studied that. I studied Business Studies at Eberswalde University of Applied Sciences, then I trained to be a master farmer after that. And your parents, your ancestors, so to speak... are all from Kaakstedt? - Yes, Kaakstedt, Fergitz and Flieth. The neighbouring villages. My grandparents on my father's side are from Fergitz. My granddad on my mother's side is from Kaakstedt, and the farm has long been in the family. And my grandma on my mother's side is from Flieth, one village further. And... how did you come up with the idea of farming organically? It was an idea that I had in 2004. I just thought it's right to go organic... As I say, I was in administration and in politics, too, for a while... and then I wanted to do something completely different, and said, the farm's mine, anyway, so why not do something with it? And I decided to orientate towards local sourcing and organic method. We own four and farm a hundred and ten hectares. We're a small family business and can't buy... we don't have the means, so we've taken long leases. This land here is a nature reserve, and agriculturally uninteresting for other enterprises. So we and our sheep graze this land and provide rural conservation this way. I think by using these many so-called residual areas, you can make a mark politically. And I find this important and necessary. So they go to small and middle-sized farms? Precisely, that the land doesn't just go to financial investors from somewhere, people with money who will pay 30,000 for a hectare, but to someone who can only pay 5000, but who is locally resident. He might be... organic, say, or similar, though not necessarily, that's his thing, yet is prioritised as a local resident. And land prices... for average soil value land, what progression have they made? Back in 2006, 2007 land was between 4000 and 5000 per hectare, now... well, it's somewhere between 20,000 and 30,000.. Per hectare. That much? - Yes... No normed person can keep pace with that. And it's not viable to pay such prices. Not in my case. Not using green land. I'd need to farm intensively, and I'm against that. So it's not lucrative to buy at these prices. Ciao. - Ciao. Here they come. Here's the motion. Come along, come along. Come along. You told me one time it all began here with the circus caravan. Well, it didn't exactly begin, but it was the first step... that could soundly be made. Children and parents had a caravan each... and it was five or six below. But we'd solved the problem of having an attractive place to dwell. And for a year, in this provisional way... You actually lived in them... - We often visited and always made this central to our family life. Around this table here... six could eat at a squeeze. And... since we were at the source, we had better meat than those with bigger tables. You started as a bootleg printer, are you today more press owner or more land owner? Property ownership is one of those things. Ownership is also an act... and not simply a legal state. But it's definitely been the case that my essential insight into my experience is developed in the field of agriculture, and no longer in printing. Because, yes, in the long-term you could say it's a real savouring of grace, getting the opportunity to have such a multifaceted... way of interacting with things, instead of just having some kind of legal interest... or being situated somewhere far from real life, or even simply not having the financial means to do otherwise. You founded some kind of ecological fund, didn't you? Yes, that was one of the measures, one of the fortuitous ones, which involved much work, but which developed consistently and correctly. There were competitors who wanted to build those famous golf courses. Polo... places. All manner of grotesque ways to exploit the land. They'd got a foot in the door to acquire the estate and its land. And for the existing business in Hohenwalde, what was involved... was an endless chain of requirements. "This needs to be provided today, that needs to be provided tomorrow." Creditworthiness was prioritised. The whole thing. So this... So the Organically Managed Land Fund was finally born from the battle for this land. It was a matter of these big investors who wanted to start out with about 10,000 hectares, and who were being supported by the state. They were confronting us and depriving us of the opportunity to maintain properties that were farmer-run and farm-sized. They approach things differently, and had there being no intervention, we'd have had a 20,000 hectare maize-belt here. This way we have an organic belt of around 20,000 hectares. Because we struggled and received the investment possibilities and financed it through the Organically Managed Land Fund. And yes, I'm not a born farmer, but you get a sense of how a certain solidarity can be the dominant force. We have, for example, managed, and it is in itself something of a sensation, to exchange a few hundred hectares between private owners in such a way that uninterrupted expanses of agricultural land are created. And that without... bloodshed, quarrelling, bitching... barking, lawyers or anything. All that land consolidation, which in the West assumed massive proportions, had to assume them, and had to be elaborately financed, we ourselves managed around the kitchen table. And that is... impressive, morally speaking. Not something I'm used to... in the printing line. Yes, right... What you all accomplished, you might say, was nothing less then saving a piece of land for humanity. Yes, it's amazing the influence one has and the strength one can muster. And here, again, loads of birds of prey. They will meet up here. Let's have a look who we have. A red kite, two of them, three of them... A common buzzard. One, two, three, four, five six... birds of prey above the meadow they are just mowing. And the red kite is in dominant numbers here. And that is something pretty rare in Germany. Very rare. There's a stork, two storks, too. Cranes. A cuckoo is calling in the distance. A yellowhammer is singing. Suddenly this is again a cultivated landscape that's to my taste. It has a culture, has cultural value. A small patch of grass like our Dürer once painted. One that has six or eight different species on it. Here I see images that I really recall from childhood. A real wealth of wildflowers of the field that are not at all disruptive. They all have their place, blossom, flower, provide nutrients, provide diversity, and of course they're a joy to behold. Some are now on the Red List in Germany as they are endangered. Here I see... Let us begin with the beautiful poppy. The poppy is one of the beautiful wildflowers of the field, so why shouldn't it be allowed to live there? Then come the many small plants here. It's fascinating. Here's a plant familiar to many, but only from its cultivation: This is wild... it's rapunzel. A rapunzel plant that's beginning to bloom, locusta lacustris, which, yes, is edible, and it tastes like the rapunzel... that we have in the garden, the cultivated variety. Then here I have a veronica, this has just borne fruit. A veronica. "Veronica, spring's in the air." Then here I have an absolutely tiny vetch, I don't know what variety it is. I really can't say. It's very small, it has two seeds no, four seeds, so it's a vicia tetrasperma, a four-seeded vetch, and also a wildflower of the fields. Then I have, isn't it pretty, here we have a little wild pansy, a viola, a viola tricolor. Generally with blue or red, and then white and yellow. This is the hairy vetch, called vicia cracca, with its violet flower heads. A leguminous plant that the bumblebees and bees like, which creates nitrogen, and which used to be more common. Here I suddenly find it again. Yes, it's beautiful, useful, and is simply part of things. Here's another small poppy. As we see, it doesn't have the black spots in the middle. It's papaver argemone. The prickly poppy. A tiny thing. We can contrast the two flowers. This one has the beautiful black colouration, the black spots at the base, while this is very different, small, and without them. So, two wild poppy varieties. We have four here. So anyway... And perhaps, oh... I see other species, but perhaps this is enough to grasp that such a field is full of life. Very diverse life. And the roots and seeds are again its basis. Here larks can peck at seeds, here the earthworm... the enchytraeids, can eat and gnaw on different roots, and this makes for abundance and healthy soil. This is, yes, pure biodiversity... and it goes back to when arable farming was introduced in the Bronze Age by settlers who came here from south-east Europe, and brought these wildflowers along with their cereals. They've survived now for millennia, and now they're all supposed to be destroyed. And why must that be? When you acquired all this, you will have had your motives for so doing. Was it as a sensible investment... No, it was completely encompassed in the yearning or intention to find somewhere here, outside Berlin, in the country, a place to dwell and be part of. It wasn't really so thoroughly planned that it could be described in its phases. This opportunity arose, it appeared and became tangible. I didn't really consider in detail what the implications would all be. Only what was important to me, being close to nature, the large amount of natural landscapes. The chance to meet people here. It wasn't all considered and added up. We didn't watch for which side tipped the scales so it could be said, then off we go! It's more like... when you have a certain longing or idea, and you let your actions follow through. It's not a hobby you're in the black, right? We're a farming business. Business is the operative word. Right? And also in the pig and sausage field, we have to stay in the black. If you're subsidising such things over longer periods, it's really no fun. Right? We want to have revenue, and we also want to be exemplary... of how one can, in a very beautiful, but agriculturally somewhat difficult environment, farm in a good but also profitable... and ecological manner. Is it hard for you if in the vicinity one sees large-scale monoculture? I'd be glad if it were otherwise. In farming, talking about neighbours is frowned on, right? We need good relations to our neighbours. And have good relations to them. With Gerswalde... with Groß Fredenwalde, too, which is also conventional. It's a precondition for things remaining calm and peaceful... which is absolutely essential. Everyone has a certain risk-tolerance. And the risk-tolerance of going into organic farming... is obviously higher... if viewed in terms of the revenue-situation involved. Naturally if you view things in terms of how... we don't know the consequences of using sprays, then the conventional colleague's risk-tolerance is higher. This is a matter for the individual. We have chosen this approach, or rather, I've been farming organically since '82. And it's not something one abandons, I mean... I worked conventionally before that, and... one worked with treated seed and spray, in the conventional manner. When I had farmed organically three years and again came upon treated seed, I used rubber gloves and showered afterwards. One's sensibilities change and one no longer wants to alter them. And I think it's also true that you can't just measure outcome in terms of profit. We have to, or I wish to, establish an economy that is born of various sources and situations and tensions, that intertwines with what I do elsewhere. And if we beseech the famous black numbers, or say such things, it's only to keep our liberty. But I have my own expectations, my expectations of success, and my satisfaction at its accomplishment, and their constellation is unconventional. And it heavily involves satisfaction, that primal... and normal satisfaction, nourished by the knowledge one is doing the right thing. It certainly has a value. So I always have something on the credit side which in terms of its convertibility into money... is hard to express. This is Mrs Henning, Hannchen. This is Gisela. Mrs Rinas. This is Mrs Rinas' Rosi. Daughter-in-law! This is Mrs Triebe, Lucie. And there's, I don't know, Angelika. I don't remember... - Milz. Angelika Milz. I'm 85 now. - Come on! No, really. I've been here for 50 years. A refugee from Pomerania. - Where there? Regenwalde district. Rügenwalde? - Regenwalde! Ah, Regenwalde. - Bernsdorf, Regenwalde district. We fled, we had to flee it, and set up afresh here, my parents did... with us seven children. I married locally here and worked for 50 years. In the building next door? - Yes, that's where I ground my bones... for 50 years. And Helga, how long have you known each other? I came here in '59, we've known each other since. I married in '51... - Since then. - ...that's when I came here. I've always been in Herrenstein. I got married here and lived here. You used to live in the manor... - I lived there for 30 years. And I lived down there 30 years. Back then the stork was there. On the roof. Yes, there used to be the stork... I didn't really see anything else. I worked, as I say, had children... That's life. You work all your life. Yes, yes... I was born in Kaakstedt. When did we get married? It was in '56. We moved to Herrenstein. And yes... like the rest of us, I worked on the co-operative farm, and did the same as everyone. My husband died in 2001. And, yes, my children... One died at the age of 40, and my grandson was 20... when he died. In an accident. How terrible. - Yes. They all went out into the world, my grandchildren. And so I'm actually alone here. I have to say, we've seen many things over the years. I was twelve when the Russians came. It's 70 years back. - Yes, 70 years. My God, how time flies. We went by horse and cart all the way to the Elbe. We didn't come back till three months had passed. My sister... and me. We returned then, and our parents were here. They'd only recently returned. Over in Pomerania, this Pole said: Be off your farm in ten minutes. Mama, Papa, Gran and seven children. We had ten minutes to leave, to stuff some bedding into sacks... left everything there and had to go to a village, an abandoned one, to work for the Russians. And our whole farm was gone. Right, all gone. We set up afresh here, my parents did. Mrs Rinas, what are you ruminating on? Sorry? - What are you ruminating on? All manner of things spring to mind. Mrs Rinas is hoping for a schnapps. That's good coming from you. I got a word in. - Well then, you two... See you, old wenches of Herrenstein! Lucie, I'll come and fetch you. And Lucie will sing you a tune. - Thanks. What? Is she drunk? No way. That's a thing of the past. A thing of the past, drinking is. Well, almost. That's not vodka. Vodka's... - Cheers. - It's water. My, how lovely that you all... - This isn't vodka. ...are here together. - It's Becherovka? So? - No, I think it's vodka. Not plum schnapps. White schnapps. Not vodka... It must be the cheap vodka... No! - Lord! ...that I'm used to. This here is a bit sharper. A potato schnapps. - It's 40 percent proof. Around 40 percent. Schnapps always plays a big role in life, right? Yes. - If we wanted to make merry, we'd have a party, dance, and drink a schnapps. It was rare. We had to work a lot. You're always only working. - We had to work a lot. If we had a birthday and some time, we'd really let our hair down. There'd be dancing and such merrymaking. We'd have a glass at work, too but we'd work on, anyway. We didn't make merry like we did if we had a day off... and a birthday, that'd be great. Without the sun, without a God Let us gather yet the crop Or: No need for either, what a joke! Soon the co-op will end up broke! And broke it went. Gone. It didn't go broke. - Broker than broke. West Berlin wasn't far from here. - No. Wilmersdorf, and then... We went... - How far is Wilmersdorf? Are you filming again? We sold the odd goose or duck. Sorry? - We took the odd goose or duck to Berlin. My husband would always ride by bicycle to Zerpenschleuse with half a pig. He'd only board there. Then he'd sell it in West Berlin. That's why the GDR fell! My uncle said, get out at Gesundbrunnen and check in the shop windows what eggs cost. I went home late, having sold my eggs at 25 pfennigs each. It was as good as it gets. Then I rode back with the train. Twenty-five west pfennigs? - Yes. Equal to one East mark. - I can't say now. Enough to buy a new pair of shoes and send off my old ones. If they'd checked me, they'd have seen I bought shoes in the West. So I had to put the shoes on, and they were so... The seam inside was so heavily stitched... Those shoes... They chafed my heels terribly. I stopped in front of every single shop window. Pulled my heels out, pushed them back. Oh, how it hurt! But I had to keep them on. Then I arrived back in Wilmersdorf and the railway lady said to me: You were pretty lucky this morning. The police turned up just as the train was pulling out. My uncle and my cousin had to say who'd been with them. So I got away, and they caught the others. With 150 eggs... - I don't know, with something else, too. I think he had ducks, too. - Ham. - A pound of butter. And that was three years after the Russians. So, in what year? - That was '50. In '47 I was confirmed... '49... So that was back in '49 or '50. And the co-op only really got going... - In '60. When the Wall went up. -'61. - Right. We all had to go. - All cows, horses, pigs were collected. The co-op took them all, we lost the lot. "It's still your money, come back for it. When you're old, you'll get it back." We got old, the Wall fell, we lost everything. No one gave us anything, we lost the lot. If we wanted to join the co-op, we had to bring so and so many beasts, so and so many critters. As a contribution. - Yes. We got our land back, they couldn't take it. But the livestock we lost was gone for good. In our case it was 15,000. All gone. Yes. This I know. - And now... - Yet we're still alive. Yes, I know. We carried on living, carried on working. So you see... - They couldn't break us. They still haven't now. We got our land back, it was no less than 20 hectares. I sold it well and then I had money. You sold... - I could take a holiday, my husband died... - You could holiday before. I couldn't. I had to work. I never went on holiday. - Work, work! But later I went on a proper holiday. Money you had... - I had no time. That's another thing. - You can't go if you have no time. A holiday! Who'd look after the livestock? No, no. You'd handed them over. - Mrs Rinas... did you have any idea, in the GDR and co-op days, what land was worth? No, we didn't know what land was worth. We... - The co-op had lots. We had 20 hectares, for example. And had the manor. Half of it. We wanted to sell it. Before the roof fell in. We couldn't maintain it. Not as co-op farmers. And we could only sell it and afford this by giving the whole thing up. The land, too. So we did so. We had nothing anyway, and it had no value. Because of the co-op. So we gave up on it. We were glad to get rid of the manor. Our half. - And the land, too. The land went too. It went for good. I don't know what became of it. I don't need it now. I can't take anything along when I go. They can pack it all in with you. They say it's all a gift, what you get in life, it all stays here. "It's all a loan." - A loan. It all stays here. Yes... - Lent. - To be sure. We don't want to leave, anyway. Cheers. Let me tell you... - What a topic! - All forgotten. All forgotten. I've given it all away. I really don't know whether the people who got their hands on all the land are much happier than you all. Who can say? The man who bought our land took his own life. He's no longer here. It was too much for him. He's gone. What's he doing at yours? - He shot himself. He had hundreds of hectares. - I don't know who it was. It went to the council back then. - Right. It must have gone to the Trust Agency. To the Trust Agency. - Right. And the Trust Agency sells to the highest bidder... They do very well. - And when people do buy it, they don't even live on it. Right. That's how it is. That's all the past. - That's what I say, too. I don't give it a thought. - It's all past. Gone but not forgotten. - All the men are gone. We women are all still alive. And we worked, too. Why is it this way? No one knows. Up there where I live... it's all old women. 100 years old, 95, 80... 70... and 3 men. In a huge building. All the men are gone, the women are still alive. Most of them. Why is that? Well, women live longer. - Men depart earlier. Many of them smoke, drink and eat too much. They have a stroke and are gone. If you live a little more healthily, stay active, you have a bit more from life. I hope we'll be seeing more of each other. Maybe we will. Then we'll resume our conversation... about life, about wonderful human life. But you can't go now, first we'll have a glass. One for the road. - Come sit over here with us. The F96, 60 kilometres north of Berlin. Anyone heading for Neubrandenburg, Stralsund, or the Baltic resorts must pass through here. Nothing but fields stretch between Löwenberg and Gransee. Fields and a few paddocks. Who would stop here? FAR AFIELD DEFA-STUDIO FOR DOCUMENTARY FILMS, 1976 The landscape changes from year to year. It's now... From when I came here originally in 1952, to when I look at it now... it has changed beyond recognition. The borders that ran between the villages have partly vanished now due to land consolidation. So it's only experienced people... practitioners... who live locally who have some idea where the borders ran, but in the fields themselves, you cannot say who once owned what. And even the village limits have now vanished. We recorded this footage over 40 years back. It was my first cinematographic encounter with the landscapes... of northern Brandenburg. I'm watching them gather stones like we used to. Did you gather stones, too? - Yes. I've done it all. And what did you like doing best? Well, it's a bit... I really can't say. I liked hacking turnips. It paid best. But it was fine, we'd normally gather stones in groups of 20. It was fun? - It was what we did most often. They'd often be frozen to midday, you didn't need to show up. Not many people work in agriculture now, right? No... A few tractor drivers, they gather stones themselves. So no one else need... It used to be work for the whole village. - Yes. We all had work. No one was unemployed. Everyone was taken. I watched the sheep on these fields, went wandering here. I made notes about almost everything since... In 1953 I began my diaries. First the birds, then the disappearance of plants, and progressively I'm now moved by social uprooting, the social and the ecological desolation in this area. This is one of the allegedly most modern agricultural landscapes in our EU-Europe, that's how it's portrayed. With the highest employment of elements alien to the system: Fungicides, pesticides, herbicides... and also with this new generation of large energy facilities: Wind power, and, in the distance, a large new solar system. One might say, everything's fine and dandy, production is ongoing, modern life is possible here, then along come these groups who question all this. The big question is the transferal of energy in this landscape, the loss of biodiversity and the loss of employment, which is by and large now gradually being understood. Behind you there's nothing to show... Yes, no one to be seen at all. I was here yesterday, I'm here today. This is a chicken fattening plant working for Wiesenhof. It's been here a year, it's very new. There's a whole network built up here. And it produces the cheapest chicken meat in the world. It's even cheaper than dog food. Everyone knows what a fried chicken costs nowadays. Less than five euros. And the whole thing involves this insane... transfer of money, feedingstuff... transportation to abattoirs... I'd just like to state a few facts about the poultry sector. The feed itself, which has to be soya, with its high protein content, comes from South America for preference. In South America, in what used to be the Pampas of Argentina, which I've visited several times, we have landscapes as large as all of East Germany that produce only one single fruit, and it's genetically engineered. Genetically modified soya. Huge container ships sail the Paraná or Paraguay Rivers and bring it to Buenos Aires. In these massive ships they cross the oceans to China, to Europe, Hamburg. These ships sail using heavy fuel oil, the worst kind of oil, which has a huge impact on the water and the air. This is the basis for the feed. And here there are these huge plants that are producing incessantly, employing almost no one: If two people are employed here, that's all they find economical. And then, yes... meat is produced here, the feed is from elsewhere. Germany, and everyone should know this, uses land twice its own dimensions outside of the country to maintain its prosperity and its exaggerated demands. These are the palm oil plants in Indonesia, the soya expanses, woodlands in the tropics that supply wood... This stands in no relation to global justice. But to continue with the trajectory of this meat, this heavily subsidised, produced meat, the good parts, the breasts, are processed here. They are packaged and sold at cheap prices in the large supermarkets. All the rest is frozen in blocks of ice and sent to Africa. I've visited Ethiopia, in particular, with my foundation. The market is flooded with subsidised meat from Germany, pork and poultry. Mostly poultry in Ethiopia. There it is thawed. And local poultry production has almost been abandoned. No one can subsidise agriculture there. Our cheap prices and cheap transportation is therefore destroying pastoral areas there. And the result, which we are slowly beginning to consider but which we cannot solve, is refugees who are crossing the Mediterranean and trying to find salvation here, after our misplaced agricultural policies and our misplaced subsidies policies have created devastation in those places. It's things like this going on and on that I personally find unendurable. That's why I think it has to be addressed, as it cannot continue. The energy transferal we see here, the nitrogen that these unrotated maize fields need in such vast quantities, all requires energy. That's why we need the wind turbines, that's why we need the solar plants, lignite-fired powerplants. This energy transferal in the landscape is indefensible, because this so-called modern agricultural landscape no longer produces of itself, but with increasing input of extraneous energy. These are things which, to my mind, are not sustainable in the long term. I'm a bit het up because it gets to me, and I get angry when I see all this around me. I mean... calling this progress... is something I cannot comprehend. May I say where your house stands? The house stands in Voßberg. Voßberg, in Low German, it translates as Fuchsberg, fox hill. Voß means a fox, so... Voßberg 21, Voßberg is my address. And did you already have a visitor today? - Yes. I always have visitors. I'm of French stock... and like having visitors, so it started early today. A guy who flies here, a hang-glider. He often visits. And I dive with him, too. I do some diving on the side. Then there was a noblewoman. A Mrs von Wangenheim. Of the famous von Wangenheim line. Gustav. You might know of him from Berlin. The lady was here. As was Mr Gerd Bauer. Those aren't cranes, they are geese. The Canada goose. The ones I was talking about. Peace and quiet now, the sound should be fine. The geese are gone. We can continue, Volker. You have a small house, but you have... maybe the most beautiful view I know in the Uckermark. Yes, the unbroken view... you really feel... It's this great freedom, really. If you're sitting here, looking over the fields, you know the sun sets over there, and over there is the Atlantic and the coast of America. You can hardly imagine greater freedom as seen from Voßberg. And actually we come out here as a family every evening with a glass of red wine and love the way the sunset is different every evening. And you know, we can say you're an Uckermark man yourself, you've watched the starry sky here on a clear night? It's mad. You see the Milky Way above the house... which you don't see in the city anymore. Speaking of nature, you were telling me earlier about Siegfried Bergmann. He's a wildlife filmmaker, a director. A qualified biologist. He specialised in wildlife filmmaking at the documentary studio in Babelsberg. At DEFA? - At DEFA, yes. And we accompanied him over many years, got to be real friends and he's a real fellow. He's made loads of wildlife films. About the courtship rituals of the black-headed gull. Fine. Be that as it may... But I have to say, in the film business... people wonder whether films make an impact and change the world. But in one film, Siegfried Bergmann managed this. It was called The Eyes of the Landscape. The eyes of the landscape are the so-called kettle-holes or dips. The holes you have in the field. In GDR agriculture, they were meant to be filled in to make smooth surfaces. And in this film, Siggi Bergmann... objected... I remember, yes... - And he... He said they were retreats, refuges for deer, small animals and so on, and he gave this nicely naive assessment of the situation, saying many frogs and toads lived there and ate up our vermin. And going by the frogs, he proved that a GDR frog was worth 5 marks and 22 pfennigs, because the vermin they eat up in a day, these frogs living in these kettle-holes, when compared to the amount of pesticides one would need to destroy as much vermin, meant a frog was worth 5 marks 22. At that point the GDR decided to let the kettle-holes remain. Because frogs are expensive. They didn't bring in hard currency but so? So that's one filmmaker who made an impact. The film won a prize in Canada, too. And it was a very nice film. I liked the title, too: The Eyes of the Landscape. You'd normally ignore them, but when I first came to the Uckermark, I noticed how they were filled in with stones and earth on top so as to increase the area, but after the film was released, kettle-holes stood where they ever did. There! What did you discover? Watch closely what it will do next. It's raining, it's pouring... the old man is snoring... Great. - I know that one. You also know All my little Ducklings. All my little doves Cooing on the roof One dove flies away Isn't that the truth? All my little doves Cooing on the roof Take a nap on the roof... Okay. - You've sung enough. These are the caterpillars of the swallowtail. A very beautiful butterfly. There aren't so many this year, but we often have so many butterflies it makes you dizzy. Particularly up amongst the scabiosa. Look this way, yes... And what are you doing at the moment? It's harvest for us. So every day we pluck the widow flowers, the scabiosa basketflowers, and many other species, collect seeds... What other species? Today we harvested the hoary plantain, we did so with the leaf-cutting machine before... processing them by hand. Oh, I lost one! And we also harvested cow parsley this week. We harvested it from a meadow. We don't cultivate it specially. And what is most endangered of the things you... or which can hardly still be found in the Uckermark? Devil's bit, for example. It's very rarely that you come across it now. You meet it in marshlands, and we don't have the necessary conservation. Wildflower honey, hmm... Given so many species... And acacia honey. That's great, too, yes. But wildflower honey is distinctly more aromatic. It's more solid but very aromatic. Is aridity a real problem or how are things? Well, it's not that bad. They're wildflowers so they can cope with it, basically. They must. The advantage here is it's clay soil, which conserves water quite well. I really wouldn't want to work on sandy soil. It'd be rather easier work. This is very tough land, if you hoe it, it's bone-breaking. But... because the land conserves water well, I very much prefer this. And do you have a favourite... A favourite plant? - A favourite meadow herb or plant? No, no I don't. I wouldn't know which to choose. I love diversity. That's why I have so many species. There are over 80 different species that we gather or grow... That's what's important to me. Otherwise I'd find it monotonous. But no, I don't have a favourite. Not at all. So many are beautiful. You should try it. It's like ouzo. This is now the fourth year it's been here. It's called medicinal fennel. It's not culinary fennel. We harvest the grains. It's grain fennel. The trick is, on the one side there's... a stock that's almost ready to harvest, and on the other side it's too green. These here are too green. This is almost ready to harvest. And here the seeds have fallen. They're in different phases of ripening. And finding the optimal time to harvest is tricky. You try to let the main stem ripen as long as possible. A consequence of this is that it contains Pendimethalin from the herbicide generally called Stomp. It's from kilometres away. No one could say where it's coming from. It's from many kilometres off, dozens of them. From when in autumn, September, farmers spray Pendimethalin. Yes, that's now. - It's now. It evaporates and spreads across the land. It's not just in fennel, it's in all of us, we all inhale it. So it's with these plants that you can see... by chance... how many plant protection agents are in the air at this time of year. And you establish it's from very far away, no one locally has employed it. It must come from somewhere, and a study was commissioned by the Land of Brandenburg, by the Ministry of Environment. And they discovered, using various measuring points in the state, that we have it everywhere: we have it in towns, in the country, we inhale it, it's not just in the fennel that absorbs it as it has this filtering capacity, it's in cabbage, veg, everything that grows at this time of year and hasn't yet been harvested. It is in all of them. On tree bark... This was recently shown, but then we found out that earlier studies had reached similar conclusions, but they had stopped examining data because since 2003, I believe, Germany no longer takes air measurements. Air is no longer tested for such chemicals. No? - No. There's no more measuring stations or monitoring. It's like in the GDR, where all environmental data was banned, and which ended in a peaceful revolution-reformation. 20 or 25 years later I'm confronted by the fact that similar things are again occurring, although huge institutions have been created to monitor the environment. The Federal Environment Agency, oh dear... The interesting thing is there were Pendimethalin problems in Lower Saxony, Rhineland-Palatinate, and North Rhine-Westphalia, and countless charges were dismissed up until 2010 or 2012. It was a mystery where the stuff came from, no one could work it out... But the problem was finally solved. I'll give you three guesses how. Maximum limits were increased? - Maxim um limits were increased. So as to evade the detection threshold with a legal maximum limit that was many times higher. Since then the problem has vanished. This dynamic has increased greatly... in that we now have various animal species that 10 or 15 years back we'd never have dreamt... might potentially be endangered one day. Like the skylark or the kite and so on. You will doubtless know other examples. And, and, yes... Something absolutely has to change, this is a drastic situation. And the agricultural reform of two years ago again didn't help. But maybe next time there will be big changes. Let's hope. And it's also a scandal that not enough organic milk is produced here. We import premium products from abroad, and export cheap meat... - ...to China. And the bill falls to us for the damage that's done, it's a real headache. Completely inexplicable. They always say about this agriculture, do you want the Stone Age again? There's a lot of progress being made, and my hope is that using mechanical systems, modern systems, we can do without chemicals. By using GPS and other techniques that are becoming available. By using the improved processors in particular, modern agriculture can be implemented without making such an impact on nature. - That's Caroline, right? - Right. Here we have this GPS device. It selects its lane alone, then it kicks in... and stays in lane so the line is straight. My name is Caroline Riesing. And where were you born? - In Templin, but I live in Temmen. And what gave you the idea of driving this huge vehicle? It was just spontaneous. I wanted to be a groom, but you could only start at 18, and I was only 16. The neighbouring farm is Temmen estate, and the farm manager offered me an apprenticeship as a farmer. And I took it. Hans-Martin Meyerhoff... - Right. Yes, and since... - ...since then, yes? I started my apprenticeship in 2007, and I've been doing it ever since. And do you live alone? With my boyfriend and my child. And the child is called? - Oscar. Oscar. - Right. He's now nine months old. And you can manage? - Yes. A crèche and... - No problem. He goes to kindergarten in Ringenwalde, and it works out fine. Bye. Are they being fed or something? - No. The young ones are practising. - Flying? No, chattering. That needs practice, too. Tell me, Kathrin, farming, the profession, is it something you find good, important? Definitely. It may be hard and the hours are unpleasant in summer, but it's what I want to do and what I want to carry on doing. And when will you learn if it's a steady job? In September... I might get an answer. The head office is in Munich, and they only know me in theory, and not in practice. So I'm caught between hope and fear. They're in Munich? - Head office, yes. They have final authority. There are lots of enterprises here with head offices elsewhere, right? We filmed here 14 years ago. With my uncle and aunt. - With whom? With my uncle and granddad. And your granddad. - Wilfried Pophal. I think Uncle Günther was sitting there, I have the video you gave me, so yes, he was there... and Granddad was sitting here. But this bit was paved with... the stones are somewhere over there, I removed them all. You both look so serious. I could tell a story bit I'd better... - Stop with that! I'd say something, but... - What rubbish. But it's the truth. - Even if it is! This isn't the place for it. - Sure it is. Nah. Fine. I'll forget it. Go on, tell us. It's nothing worth hearing. There'll be a lot of bad blood here. - And that's all. Is it from the past or the present? No, from now. The fall of the Wall. You don't have to go into all the details. Well... well... We'd have to go back to 1960... to explain the story - Then out with it! It's ancient history. 1960 is gone, though you think back on it. That's when they liberated us from all our livestock. They all came into the farmhouse, these forest rangers from Templin, all in uniform, and I'd better not mention the rest. Then it was: yes or no! Saying no meant declaring war. You joined the co-op if you wanted peace. It wasn't good here but I want to stay... But I know people who went up against them. And anyway... Some old farmers... one took a rope and hanged himself. He wasn't the only one. And a couple of them were put behind bars for having refused. It wasn't quite that bad here, I have to say... - Hmm. - It didn't come to that. Right? Well, well... - And that was that. One year later, that was in '60... No. It was '60... March the eighth, '60. In what month did the farmers run away? It was autumn, winter, the following year. '60. - September or October... There was snow, it was in winter. They ran away. - Eleven families in one night. The village was half empty. And a couple of families soon followed. Another five or six, the village was half empty. Well, well... What became of those who ran off? - Lots of them went to Canada. Many did. - Many went there. The neighbour here, he's in Canada how. The woman who farmed here is in Canada, too. Lots went to Canada. - Yes. Well, well... Whether they are doing well there... She was here a few years back and said if her husband wasn't buried there, and the kids weren't there, she'd return. So it's not easy there. But no one ever returned. - No. No one of them. Ever. - No. The old have died out. There's just the kids. They've made a living someplace, over in the West or in Canada, and never came back. Most sold up... here. Most sold up after the Wall fell. The owners, the heirs. Well, well... That's how it is. Dead and gone. - Yes, they're gene. Well, well... Yes. It's a I'm-saying-nothing seat! On your side, yes! "No, you tell them!" And your friends from the old days? Hardly anyone's still here. They all moved away. Because of work, right? I spent six years in Baden-Württemberg myself. Working. - Where? In Baden-Württemberg. I was there six years. I've had this piece of land now since 2007. And I've been back here since 2009. Late 2009? Right. Since late 2009 I've been back here. But I was six years in Baden-Württemberg. Working. But it's... here it is wonderful, down there, uh-uh... If you have a house and farm, you don't want to leave. I don't care if I do night work, what counts is staying here, right? I grew up here, lived here 25 years and then... That's how it is, you don't want to leave the Uckermark. Maybe I'll work as a cook again one day. You never forget what you've learned. But I don't want to right now, uh-uh. And there are few chances here, anyway. That's how it is. In Baden-Württemberg I'd find work. No trouble at all. At my old place, if I wanted. I'd just need to call and I'd be in work. But I have wife and child here, so uh-uh. And we're keeping the property in the family, that was important... for my uncle. He didn't want me to sell it, but to keep it in the family. And as I took care of them for five years, my uncle and aunt, who lived here... yes... And if they look down and see what we've done, they'll be proud. That's right. Because we've done stuff, fixed things, and a child's growing up. They were never blessed... with their own children. Preheating? - Yes. Just a bit. Well, Wolfgang, your love of... farm machines, tractors... has it remained constant? Remained constant? It's more, how did it begin? I was a kid, I was a kid, saw a tractor, took a look, found it good, and never wanted to be far from one. That hasn't changed since. You're always on the look out if something is going begging. Wondering if you can have it. Or not. Depending. So I've got my four farm machines to play around with. That's a threshing box back there, right? It's back from the days of the family farmer. Back in the '50s, it dates back to then. It's the only large pieces of machinery that survived because it's always been in the dry, in the barn. And, with a bit of work... it could be made to work, it's not broken at all. But you'd never seen it... in action, the threshing box? I have seen it in action. - Yes? We threshed with it when I was a child. When I was seven, six, eight, until I was eight years old. It stood here and we threshed here, and we threshed where you're staying, in that barn. My parents were here, and down there... Egon, he didn't have one, so it'd be driven down there. And the neighbour, the next door neighbour, he had a baler, a straw baler, that stood behind it. It would be piled up, right? Yes, he'd stand here on the barn floor, the rick would reach almost up to the roof, there'd normally be two or three women, who'd throw it down, one guy would stand up top, and cut through the cord... when the cord had been tied. Or earlier, when they tied with straw, he'd cut it through and slowly push it in. How nicely you hold hands. That's right! Isn't it? You can't see my hand down there. It's like we're in love, right? Helga, when did you come here? - 1960. I came here in '56, so it's been... Since we were in the coop, right? Or we wouldn't have met. And have you never argued? - No. Very seldom. Yes, we... - We've disagreed... When you don't want to sit at our table. Yes. But I get my way. - Yes, you are victorious. Hannchen has a pretty garden. - She has a pretty garden. She can still manage. Easy for you to say. I let no weeds grow. - No. I don't want one anymore. No garden? - No. I worked too long in the fields. I've had enough. She won't ride a bike anymore. She only wants to go on holiday now. That's essential. Where did he get to? He was just here. Did he just drive away? Don't ask me. What was the hardest job in life, on the fields? All of it was hard for us. It was all hard. Mostly it'd just be us women, the men would be in tractors and so on. All our work was done by hand. All by hand. Until combine harvesters arrived, until it was all... a bit mechanised, it was very hard. And there'd be work at home, too. The livestock. Cows, pigs, chickens, 150 chickens, ducks... They'd need taking care of after work. Then there'd be the children... Looking back it's hard to believe you managed it all, it was... It was hard up on the strawstacks. - ...hard. Stacking the bales up high was... And if they weren't really dry... - Right. You'd be kept very busy. And loading and stacking sheaves and walking kilometres every day... Well... Today it's not all gathering stones. Weeks of gathering stones. They don't do it anymore. They pick them up with this thing, two people walk either side... And what do you like to think back on... from those days? - Somehow we always say, they were great days, anyway. It was always convivial, it was fun. Why not? You didn't think it was... Some were used to it from home already. We had to lend a hand from an early age. We had to help with anything we could. But no, not again. If I had to start over now, I'd not do it again. And you didn't earn that much, anyway, for having done such hard work.
