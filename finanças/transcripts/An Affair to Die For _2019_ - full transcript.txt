Subtitles by explosiveskull Hi, hi honey. Hey, how's it going? Good, should be there in like an hour. You're making good time. You know me, I can't resist an open road. Just watch out for those Colorado Springs cops. Wouldn't want to be late to your 50th conference this year. Oh honey, it's not a conference. I told you, it's a little consulting thing for a hospital. Just a, bad coffee, twin bed, you know, it helps them. You're such a saint. Has, um, Chelsea called? She did actually. She had a question about our phone plan, I don't know. Something about blocking callers. I told her she should defer to my better half. What time is it there now, she's probably out drinking with her friends. I can, I can wait until tomorrow, I'll call her. None of that, she's at the library studying. But yes, I think you're fine. She can have fun, Russ. Yes, she can. But, I know what's out there, okay and I know how guys think and it's not always pretty. Yeah, well I know how girls think, and we're not all walking targets, trust me, she'll be fine. Are you driving? Yeah, I'm going to Costco real quick. So unnecessary, why do you do that? Honey, going to these conferences every other week is unnecessary. So let's leave it at that. I told you it's not a conference. Maybe we could do something together one weekend? We can go somewhere, pack a trunk full of wine. Yeah, I mean, obviously this weekend I've got the conference. I thought it wasn't a conference? Well anyway, I'm just saying, you know I'll be exhausted and next weekend it would be nice for me just to be home, but, you know, if you want to go. Yeah, well, it was just a thought. You pack your sleep meds? Yeah, yeah I got it. I doubt I need it, but I got it. Okay I will call you when I uh, when I get a break. The reception, cell reception I'm sure, is going to be pretty bad out there, so. Hold on, what's the code for the sprinkler system again? Seriously, Russ, it's the same code that we've been using for ever, it's 9-18-91. And what a first date it was. I was a little worried when you gave it up after just dinner and a movie. But you got that side of you. Okay Casanova. Alright, alright. Bye. Love you. Love you. Thank you. You must be Mrs. Alan. Yeah, yeah, yes I am. We're very happy to have you with us this weekend. Mr. Alan has taken care of everything. You're in the Black Diamond suit, of course let us know if we can be of any assistance and Dave will show you to your room. Thank you. Right this way. It's supposed to be a gorgeous weekend. A little chilly, but clear. Oh. Is this a special weekend or an anniversary stay? Um, just a weekend getaway. Well, he's got good taste. Gotta say, I'm pretty fresh up here, our two-year next month. Oh, congratulations. I'm sure she's a lucky lady. Thank you. If you don't mind me asking, have long have you been married? 20, um, 21 years. That's a long time. Hm. If it's not too much to ask, how do you manage? I mean, I'm two years in, I don't know, any advice for somebody just starting out like me? Uh, distance makes the heart grow fonder, but never be distant when you're in your wife's arms. And flowers, yeah, they actually work. Here we are. Thanks, it was something I really needed to hear. Your husband must be a very lucky man. After you. Nice, isn't it? Yeah. Take a look around. The living room's here, internet. If you'd like, I'll leave your bag in the bedroom. Thank you so much. Much appreciated, mam. Have a wonderful stay. So intoxicating Everett? Everett is that you? Everett. Oh God. Yes. Everett. Yes, yes, yes, yes. Yes, Everett, yes, oh! Stop, stop, stop. Oh stop. Stop. Stop, stop, stop. Get off me. Please. I said atop it. No. Now, let's see you lie. No one leaves this room. Not you, not her. Your family is in danger. I have Lydia and Jessica. How old is Jessica? A year and a half old? But not a word to Holly. You stay put until I'm gone. And let's remember the importance of family. I'll call you later. Enjoy my wife. Everett! Everett! Please, Everett. Can you, can you just get these off me. I'm sorry. You think you can take advantage of me like that? What make you do that to me? - I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - What makes you think you can do that to me? Get out! I'm sorry. Get away from me. I'm gone, I am gone. You do not get to do that to me. You do not get to do that to me. You don't get to do that. Hello? What's the first thing I told you? She doesn't leave. Please. Holly, wait, wait. - Please wait, wait, please. - Don't touch me. I didn't mean for it to get out of control. Please, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry, I got caught in the moment. Please don't leave me. I want to keep going, please. Please, I'm so sorry. Holly, I'm sorry. Pretty smooth. Why are you doing this? Your family thanks you. Please, don't hurt my family. I wish I could say the same about mine. Mr. Pierpoint, look, I know you're upset, but this is crazy, you can't just keep us here like... You're right, but you can. What am I supposed... That's up to you, Everett. You're smart. Six months of sneaking around, well, five months and three weeks. I'm embarrassed it took me that long but, you know, banks call about charges that big. I'm guessing that was your tuition? Look, please, Mr. Pierpoint... Call me Russell. What do you want me to do? You do what you want, Everett. Just as Holly will do as she wants. Just know if she leaves, or if the police are called, or if anything happens that is not you two walking out of this hotel tomorrow afternoon like nothing happened, I kill your family. I'll start by killing your beautiful wife Lydia. What do you think about that Lydia? Everett, help! Don't test me, you punk. I made a mistake. You, you can hit me, punish me, do whatever you want, but please, don't run away. Can we start over? What part of you, seriously Everett, what made you think - that that was okay? - I'm sorry. I want to know, tell it, explain it to me. I thought you were enjoying it. Enjoying myself? We've been doing this for as long as we have, I thought I would try something new. New? Something new would be giving me my coffee without any fucking cream and sugar in it. I mean... Yeah, you're right. You're right. I'm sorry. I wouldn't even have done it, had, Had what? had you not said what you did last weekend. What did I say last weekend? That you liked it rough. And when I did things to you in the moment. That doesn't make it right, I know that. Please, please can we start over? Hi, honey. Holly, where are you? Uh, I'm, I'm still at the hospital. I'm just on a break, it's good timing. In Colorado Springs? Hm-mm, yeah. Hi sir, hotel security. Sorry to bother you folks this afternoon. We just had a noise complaint and I wanted to come check in on you guys. Sorry. Is something wrong? - Okay, just doing my job. - You're not in Colorado Springs, Holly and you are in serious danger. What? Is everything okay in here? Uh. Sir? Huh, yeah, uh, very sorry, we'll keep it down. Everett Alan is not safe. You need to listen to me very clearly. Is he nearby? Holly, are you clear to talk to me? Who's Everett? Honey, what are you talking about? I'm talking about the man you're fucking that isn't me. His name is Everett Alan. He is 27 years old, wife named Lydia, same age, daughter named Jessica, she's just a year and a half old. You might have been sneaking around for months, and I've just caught wind, but, that's not what's important right now, so listen to me closely. He is a dangerous man. Everett, Everett Alan, honey, uh, he's a student. That's a student in my class. Do you really think you're the first fling? What? Or the only one he has right now? Holly, can you open up? Girls have gone missing, Holly. Even girls who didn't go all the way out to Aspen for a weekend getaway. Do you have any idea what position you've put yourself in? Stupid, you're fucking stupid Holly. You need to get out of there, but leave quietly. Only when you have a chance. Holly? Don't just bolt or arouse suspicion, just slip out. Russ, is this real? Sorry, who was that? My husband. What'd he want? He's just checking up on me. Right. Um. I'm a, I got to get some air. Wait, I did something for us. Come. Let me make amends. Let me help you. Oh no, I... It defeats the purpose if you're texting while I work out your knots. Alright. I um... You can trust me. Hm. Just your back, I promise. Okay. Lie down. You'll have to bear with me, I'm not really a masseuse. Here. So how'd I do on that thoracic exam? Even with your help, I bet I land around a C-minus. How did you afford this? Rule Number Three. It's extravagant. Wouldn't it raise some red flags? Well, I do have a credit card, now. No more questions, Rule Number Three clearly states... It's a large charge, wouldn't your wife see? I, um, pre-cleared it. Besides she doesn't have the head for financing. We're fine. What'd you tell your husband for this weekend? Rule Number One. You started it. Consulting gig in Colorado Springs. Are you still in Denver? Yeah. What does he do? Wow, you really are trying to, break Rule Number One. I just think I've earned the right to know. I mean, if he's a boxer or cop, I gotta know how fast I have to run, right? There would be no running from him, trust me. Is that why he called? What do you mean? No, I just wondered if everything's fine? I mean, he called you. Yeah, he's just checking in on me. What'd he say? I'm sorry, it's just so not comfortable, this bed. Uh, he just said that wants me to check in with him, you know, before I go to sleep. I mean, doesn't your wife like you to check in with her when you're away for the weekend? Yeah. What does Mrs. Alan do? Well, with my daughter she does what she can. The odd jobs, on and off. Like what? That's enough. Well I can't wait to see what you've got planned for the weekend. What is on the agenda? Mostly just a lot of stay-in activities. It's cold out, and there's fates worse than keeping us in this room all weekend. That is, if I'm enough for you. Of course you are. I'm just going to go and you know, you know, wash all of the oils off me. Get ready for our... No, no, no. - Carry the calm to the shower. - Hey just... My room, my rules. It'll be here when you get back. Sure. Sorry, please. Come on. Is anyone there? Please, I'm in the Black Diamond suite. Holly? Please! Shit Everett, you, you scared me. Sorry I was knocking and I thought maybe you slipped. No, no. No, I was just about to take a shower. Oh. Hmm. I do love it when we shower together. Oh, I, I really, really just want to shower alone, if that's okay. It's not so bad, is it? Since we've already broken rules one and three, I'd really like to know what your husband does for a living. Why? Curiosity. You haven't quite killed the cat. It must not be good, otherwise you would've already told me by now. Well, you're getting warmer. Cop? Warmer. Detective? Warmer. Jesus, what is he, an assassin? No, he's surveillance. You're kidding? He's retired now but he's. You do realize you are having a fucking affair and your husband is police surveillance? Get off me! Jesus fucking Christ, Holly! What? Christ! Everett, I don't... No, hm. Don't you think this would have been good information to tell me, I don't know, three months ago? I don't understand why. Let me guess, he told you he wouldn't use power in evil against you, bug you, or follow you, or do whatever the fuck surveillance does! - He sits at a desk now. - Oh bullshit! Fuck! This isn't good. Why? Do I need to spell it out for you? Stay here. Everett? Everett? Will you leave me alone for one fucking second, please? Sure. How do you know? How the fuck do you know? How do you see me? What the fuck? Why? I'm sorry about lashing out before. You look really nice. Would you care to join me on the balcony for a drink? Clear night, you can see the stars. Yeah. It's cold here, let me help you. I got it. Have you tried the wine? Could I get a glass of white, do you mind? It's just, I feel like the red's gonna knock me out. I think there's like half a bottle left in the fridge. Is that okay? - No it's fine. - Are you sure? Yeah, yeah, I'm sure. You can leave that. It's very good. Shit! Everything okay? Oh I was just - moving the blanket. - Jesus, Holly! I know, well I was moving the blanket. I was just too cold. - It's fine, here. - I'm sorry. - I didn't mean to. - Here take this. Thank you. Be careful. To us. Cheers. - Well I'll get it. - I got it. - No I got it. - No really. You've done enough. Please sit, please. Relax. Uh, good evening sir! My name's Dave, it's my pleasure to serve your dinner. Would you like me to come back later? No, sorry, come in. Ah, hello again mam. What's for dinner? Unfortunately I just carried the tray, but it smells delicious. And our chef is fantastic, I don't think you'll be disappointed. Madam, for you. Sir, yours. Uh, if there's anything else you need or if you'd like this cleared out, just call down to reception. You can ask for me and otherwise we'll be through tomorrow morning to take care of it. Thank you. Oh, I've got it. Shoot, one minute. Is there any special instructions from the chef? No, Chef didn't say anything. Would you like me to ask him? That's fine. Thank you so very much. Yeah, my pleasure, as always. Enjoy dinner. Shall we? Sure. What's for dinner? I went with the Chef's Special for two. Fine. Wow, the chef has really got a sense of humor and not much imagination, clearly. Well, I love a rare steak. Well you always were the more adventurous one. I am? Well, I can't help but wonder, I'm not entirely sure, I would have come aboard this wonderful, wild ride had you not been so forward with me. I was the forward one? As far as I remember you had borderline failing grades, and I asked you if you wanted or needed any special assistance on the next chapter, to which you enthusiastically agreed. You're a hell of a teacher, what can I say? No, you can say that. You know, I'll never forget my first day. Your enthusiastic disapproval for my use of anesthetics. It was your pride that hooked me, guess it was just some cruel twist of fate that our first private session was on the reproductive system. Yes a magical, mystical revelation in evolutionary science. How any of us pop into this world is a roll of the dice. And yet here we are. You know, I don't think I got to thank you for helping me get by. I know you know, and I know too that I actually could make a really good doctor. Sorry, I know that? Well, why else would you help me? Oh, a moment of weakness. Oh that's funny 'cause I thought, you... You said cruel twist of fate. What did you mean, what's cruel? Let's call it what it is. What is it? We're both married. Yeah, yes we are. Did you enjoy our time together? Yeah I enjoyed it. Have you? Yes, I have enjoyed it. The natural moments, that haven't been born from predisposed days, weeks, years, of knowing exactly how someone's going to react. The unknowable. Moments of pure shock and chance. Pleasure of body and mind, which of course can only happen because you don't know how someone's going to react. And then of course, it is all intensified because it is forbidden fruit. It's wrong. So every stolen moment, every late-night rendezvous, my optimistic mind tricks me into thinking that maybe this is the rocky road before something new and wonderful happens. But I wouldn't take that leap. I would never take that risk. So here we are, a pleasurable purgatory. But we had fun. Yeah, it's been fun. Where is my phone? After dinner, I promise. Everett, what's going on? What is that? Empty plate. What's going on? Hey, what's wrong? Please don't. - Oh Everett. - Holly. Come on, have a drink. What suddenly a little dinner detour's too risque for you? Come on. Did you think that your show of power earlier was going to be the be-all and end-all of us fucking today? Is that what you thought? Holly, please put it down. I want you to tell me everything's that's going on here and then I'm going to go. I'm sorry. Talk. Sexual assault's not going to be hard to prove, you're kinda fucked on that one. Please. Talk. Lean in. What? Lean in as if to kiss me. - I'm not going to kiss you. - You need to trust me. I don't trust you. Listen to me, the room is bugged. I don't know how but he can see and hear us. - Who? - Your husband. - He set this up. - What? Yes. He has my family, he's punishing me for us, okay? Come on. Something's wrong with me. Help! I'm sorry. What? What the fuck? What the fuck? Easy. No! Holly. Don't touch me. What's the last thing you remember? Stop listen. You drugged me. What's the last thing you remember? What that my husband's setting this all up? That's he's the one that's listening to us? You psycho. I know who you are. Who am I? He told me, you know. I don't. I'm not the first person that you've done this to! I'm not the only person that you've done this to. What are you talking about? You better let me out of here, Everett. Because Russell's coming and he's bringing the whole force with him. Is he? Quiet, quiet. Shh! What the fuck? What the fuck? Look at me, look at me. What's going on? Is this over, can we go? Who's doing this? What's in this? Is this in you? Tell me. Take this, write it down. Tell me everything. Write it down, come on. Shit! Everett, you have to let me out of these. - I - can't, and not yet. There's no scenario here where you get away with this. Do you understand? Holly, I... Everett it's over, it's done. Don't make this any worse than it already is. Think about your family. This could be a turning point for you. I could help you, Everett. You could, start the healing. But I'm a psycho, right? Date 'em and dump 'em, probably worse, is that what Russell told you? I could give two shits about my family. And you think he's going to ride in on a white horse and save you from bad me? I can't wait it. Well then I better not waste any more time. No, Everett, no, please! No, don't do it. No, don't do it. Russ, oh my god. Oh my god. What did you do? What did you do? I didn't do anything. What did do you? I'm here, I'm here. I'm here, Russ. No. I, I found this. I don't know what's in it. This is for both of you. Remember, you were both married. And affairs hurt both families. But I'm going to make an exception and change the rules. Now, only one of you will be checking out come morning. Figure it out amongst yourselves, but only one of you get to leave your little love nest and go home to see what's left of your family. The other, well, you will have taken care of them. Holly, let's just say Chelsea may have wound up in strange company after her wild night out last night. Her roommate Sammy is far too trusting. And Everett, well, you already know how close I am with your family. Again, If either of you try to contact the police, or reach out for help, or both try to leave, I will kill what's left of both of your families. Then you two can truly run away together because that's all you'll have. Clock's ticking. Jessica's almost two years old. I don't have a choice. Everett, stop, just think about this for one second. We are in this together. Think about my daughter, just think about my daughter. Please, you have to understand. Stop. Mister and Missus? If you're in, please open up. Hotel Security. Oh god. Sorry to interrupt. Uh, that's okay, sorry it took so long. How can I help you? Another noise complaint. Oh, geeze, I'm sorry. We get carried away sometimes, we'll keep it down. Yeah, anyway, sorry to bother you, but one of the wait staff has gone missing. Uh, he sent some strange text messages to one of the other staff, so we're talking to as many of the guests as we can, who were in contact with him. Wow, I hope he's okay. How can I help? Well, first off, his name's Dave Parker, and the kitchen staff said last he'd delivered dinner here. Is your wife here with you? Uh-huh. Can we speak with her? Yes, one second. What are you doing? I'm going to let you out. We have to work together now for the sake of our families. We have to lie. Okay. Okay. Um I'm so sorry, it's our weekend away, so. Great, Mrs.? Holly. Holly, Holly nice to meet you. Uh, we were just telling your... Everett's fine. Everett, we were just telling Everett one of the wait staff, Dave Parker... The room service guy has gone missing. Gosh, that's, well that's terrible news. We were just wondering maybe he mentioned where he might of been going or if he was acting strange while he was here with you guys? No. He was very polite and professional. He, he came in, he set up our food, and we tipped him, he left. Would you excuse me? - Of course. - Of course. That's fine. Thank you. Okay. Have you left the room any time after dinner to go to the front desk or get ice? No we've been in here all night. Sir, is there anything that you can think of while we're here, anything? No not really, honestly. That's it right, honey? Yeah, that's it. Well, that seems to be everything. Please, enjoy the rest of your stay. Thank you. Oh and sir, we're going to be following up with a few other guests, if there's anything that you think of... We'll let you know. Thank you gentlemen. Want to sit down? Let's talk about this? Whoever's doing this is probably be watching us right now. Well, how convenient of them and how are they managing that, Everett? I have my theories. But your husband's background in surveillance could have been beneficial. So who's doing this? I don't know. How do I know it isn't you, Everett? My wife's ring finger was sent with dinner as punishment for failing to follow the previous rules. Go check the covered plate, in the sink. And what rules were those? Go look. Christ. The rules were I keep you here and don't tell you anything and we both get to leave in the morning. But now... Only one of us gets to leave. Now let's be perfectly honest Everett, if those security guards hadn't of shown up, you would have murdered me and walked straight out of here. I see. Am I making you uncomfortable? Look. I have a wife and a child that I provide for. I can't just leave them. Well Everett, let me spell this out for you. You already did. Six months ago when you started fucking your professor. In that vain hope that you might actually become a real doctor. And what about you? What about me? You've killed my husband, you left me tied while he was dying and I could of saved him. This is all your fault. Everything is your fault. You, Everett Alan, are the worst thing that could ever of happened to anybody. Let me tell you how this all started. Don't. With me, bound and gagged on the floor, watching your husband fuck you. It wasn't me, Holly, think about it. You know the last thing he said to me before he untied me and threatened to kill my family, "Enjoy my wife." So tell me, Everett, who's doing this? Told you, I don't know. Alright, I'm going home to my daughter. Did you ever have feelings for me? Don't. - I'm serious. - Don't come any closer. I mean it, did you? Do not come any closer. I know after all this you want to write it off as a fling or a transactional relationship, but I don't think that's what it was. I wasn't going to hurt you in there, I promise, I could never hurt you. Let's not do this, please. Please Holly. I love you. Oh god. Don't. Oh God. Wait, wait, wait. How are we going to lie about this? I need a doctor. We're bad people, holly. No we're not. I'm cold. I'm getting cold, Holly. I know we're not supposed to be together, will you hold my hand? I'm so sorry. Please don't tell my family. I won't. Do you think they'll forgive me? I don't know. Will you forgive me? Will you forgive me for them? Yes, yes I forgive you. I forgive you Everett. Holly. I'm here, I'm here. You are one step away from freedom. All you have to do is destroy this phone. Put it in the microwave for thirty seconds and that's it, you can go home. Or, you can come to room 513 and meet me. And I'll introduce myself and tell you why I did this. And then, I'll let you go, I promise. You won't be harmed. Don't worry about the room. It will be taken care of. My room key is in your husband's pocket. Now please, put this phone out of its misery. Oh my god. No, no, no, no, no, don't touch me! No, no, it's okay. It's over, it's okay. I'm not going to hurt you. No, I promise you, I am not going to hurt you. No, it's okay. It's okay, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not going to hurt you. I am not going to hurt you. I'm going to take off your blindfold. Good, I'm not going to hurt you. Okay. Okay. Jesus Christ. Where's Everett? Where's my husband? Where is he? I'm going to call the police and I'm going to get us out here, I promise you. Wait here. Guess Russ never fully trusted me. Oh god. Smart man. It didn't take much to get him on board, though. Why? Why, you mean why would anyone betray the love and trust of the person closest to them? I don't know, you tell me. You, you made us... I didn't make you do anything, Holly. Everett's first two were nothing. First two girls were, just vanished like a bad dream. But you. He was obsessed with you. And now that I'm standing next to you, I can understand why. He had everything, but that, it just wasn't enough. We need the medics in room 512. Call the police and send ambulance. You're not going to get away with this. There could be three, likely armed and dangerous. I think I will. No. Oh God, oh my God. Both of your fingerprints are everywhere. The instruments I used to cut out your husband's tongue, on the syringe, even on the knife you used on that poor boy, Dr. Pierpoint. It's Security, I need you to open the door. Russell paid for your sins. Open up. And your daughter will too. Where is Dr. Pierpoint? Mam, don't move. I need you to stay still and raise your hands. Mam, I need you to raise your hands.
