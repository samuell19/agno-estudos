Oh... hey, buddy boo. Come here, boy. Come here. All right. - Hey, girl. - Hi, Wrestlerstud. You look hot today. - So do you. - Thanks. Show me lower. Mm-mm-mm. Thank you, mama. Gotta be quick. Whatever you want. Ooh. Did you save a big load for me this time? Just wait and see, baby. Oh, fuck. Who's your buddy? Does he want to join? What buddy? The one that just came in the room. You scared me. What? - Dude. - What? Use fucking headphones if you're gonna watch porn. I have students texting me. I didn't know that it went through the door. It does when it's open. Shut it, like this. I was sh... Sorry. Need to get back in the mood. Well, where'd your friend go? Maybe he can help. Nice try. Ah, fuck! Stop! Stop it! You're gonna kill him! Stop it! Get off! Get off of him! Stop! Man, oh, man. Look at this. Wish I was going back to college. I know. I know you crushed it. Yeah. Well, you can too, you know. You know it doesn't matter you didn't do shit in high school, 'cause college chicks are, like, way more sophisticated. Dudes too. Hey, college dudes are, like, sophisticated, you know? - I'm here for the education. - Yeah, I know, Mr. Full Ride. All I'm trying to say is college is about finding out what you want and going after it. Jacob. I got it. I know. I know. You got it. All right. Thank you. Look, Bri-Bri. Me and Nana, we're real proud of you, okay? Now, 15 minutes down the road if you need anything. Go get 'em, tiger. Come on! - Want me to help you? - Yeah. Just... - You're a big, strong boy. - Thanks. - All right. Let's go. - I'm good. Looking good, buddy. Proud of you, bro. Thanks. Hey. Brian Tims? Hi, welcome to Starling University. I'm Chloe, your dorm R.A. This is Tommy, my jack-of-all-trades. Let me get you checked in. "New Joisey." The armpit of America. At least it's only eight miles away from midtown Manhattan. Yeah. No one from New Jersey actually says "Joisey" in any context, unless you're from New Jersey and trying to explain that people don't say "Joisey." If you say so. All right, this is gonna get you on Wi-Fi. It's also got some orientation materials and some free student software. And... all right, Joisey. You are in room 213. - Thanks. - See you around. Good luck. - Oh. I'm sorry. - Okay. Erin! Erin, where are you? Whatever. Hi! How are you? So good to see you! Hi! No, no, I just arrived. - Oh, shit. - I'm... I'm so sorry. God. You ever heard of knocking? Should I leave? I... Just messing with you, bro. It's all good. Um... here, set your monitor down, I'll help you with your bag. Shit. Got a body in there, or what's up, man? I just... I brought a bottle of wine with me. Ah! Fancy, aren't you? Well, I'm sorry about that, man. I'll get you a new one. I'm Jeremy. - Brian. - Nice to meet you. This is my beautiful girlfriend, Lexi. - Hi. - Brian. Ah. You must be one of the lucky freshman to get a sophomore roommate to show you the ropes. I guess so. All right, well, come on. Let's let him get settled in peace. - See you around. - Thanks. Hmm. Speak of the devil. No, no, Nana, Nana. No, I... I'm not calling you the devil. I was... I was looking at a picture of you when you called. Yeah, everything's great. No, I'm... I'm glad I saved the money. Yeah. You know, screw NYU. Yeah, his name's Jeremy. He's got a really pretty girlfriend. Yeah. Really pretty. Nah. Apparently he, uh, took over my drawer. No, Nana, I did not get a chance to choose my side of the room. No. Yeah, that's... yeah, that's right. Well, I don't know. Maybe he's just... Maybe he's just being an idiot. I don't know. Hey, Nana, I should... I should go before I break anything else. Okay... okay, Nana. Bye, Nana. I love you too. Okay, ciao. - What's up, bro? - Yeah, I have a flash drive that, uh, says it's full, but when I open it, it looks empty. Yeah, that happens if you eject it before emptying the trash. Uh, hit command-shift-period and you should see the hidden trash folder, and then you can just delete whatever's in there. Oh, okay, cool. Thanks, that worked. Yeah, no problem. Peace. Harder. - Pop it for me, baby! - Oh, my God. Pop one more for me. Come on. Pop one more for me, baby. One more! One more, baby! Now smear it all over your face, boy. You know what I want next. I know what you want, master. I know you want a bit of that. Huh, master? Aren't you forgetting something? Yeah, I am. I am, master. This is what I'm missing. You know exactly where to stick that. Oh, yeah. Right there. Mmm, down here, down here, baby... master. Whoa. Oh, you're very talented, Mr. Clown. Happy birthday to me! Yo! Oh. Well, Zeta Delta Psi's throwing a party. - What's that? - A frat! Come on. There'll be beer, girls, guys. - What more do you need? - I don't know. I might... I might just hang out, watch a movie. Bro... bro! - Yeah. - Come on, dude! Let's go, baby! Woo! Zeta Delta Psi, let's go! Joisey! - Let's do shots. Here. - I'm good. - No, no, no, don't be such a beeyotch. - Thanks. - Cheers. Shots! Shots! Shots! You gotta drink it! Chug! Chug! Chug! Ha ha! Yo, Bri-Bri! This is dope. College party. Yeah, it seems more like a "you" thing. Yeah, well, it looks like you're doing just fine. - Come on, let's dance! - Hey, I'm Janelle. This is my brother, Jacob. I'm security. Tough guy. Well, we're stealing him, so... You look a little old to be at this party. - You got weed? - What? I'm saying you got some fucking weed, 'cause I wanna get fucked up! That dickwad Jeremy's into dudes. I am telling you, my gaydar is never wrong. Oh, my God. Timothy, the tea is boiling! Your one and only source into the scandalous lives of Starling's elite. XOXO, Gossip Girl! All tea, all shade, all lemonade, honey. Let's just find Janelle. Who are you checking out? What? Who are you checking out? I thought I saw someone I knew. Hey, where's Lexi? Getting more beer. Lexi! Lexi! Whoops. Sorry. - What the fuck is your problem? - Kenny, stop it! He's new here. Fuck you up, bro! You're friends with this fucking loser? Shut up and kiss me. You fucked up? I got a high tolerance. You gotta shotgun it. - Shotgun? - Yeah, you shotgun before? Bro, I've been shotgunning since you've been sucking on your mom's tits. Okay? Damn. - At least try it. Here, watch. - What? Yo, hold up. Just come here. Watch, I'll show you. Whoa. Okay. Well, I'm gonna go. No, bro, wait. Yo, yo, yo, dude, I don't know who gave you this shit, but... Sleep it off, bro. Drink some water, okay? It's all good, G. Yo. Lexi. It's Tommy, from class. You all right? Hi! English Lit. I know you. Hi. You need a ride or a Lyft or anything? She's with us. She needs to drink some water. - Is she good? - Yeah, we got her. Done. It's helping. Let's go. Oh, it's too much. How much did you drink? I don't even know. I know that you drank the same amount as me tonight. I'm not fucked up. - Oh? - I'm fucked up too. Careful. Stairs... You're a really good guy. Thanks. Hey, no. This way, guys. Fuck... Wrestlerstud? Who else would I be? I've never done this before. Shh... Ah. All of you are thinking the same thing: Who is this successful woman and why should we get off Instagram and listen to this world-renowned professor of physics, and author of three New York Times bestselling books? I'll tell you why. Because I stand between you and your degree. There also wouldn't be Instagram without physics. Do follow me, though, I'm trying to get to 500k. Do you have a pen? What? I said, "Do you have a pen?" Yeah. I'm coming. So when we're talking about... Okay. All right, everyone, please. Let's just try to stay mature, guys. - Oh. - Oh, shit. Sorry. Oh, my gosh. Shit. What happened to your laptop? It slipped off my desk. Oh, you know what? There's just really nice guy from English Lit who works at tech support. I can take you over there. I have to get mine checked out anyway. I'll just have my brother help me. He's pretty good with computers. I kinda don't trust anyone to go through my files. Why? What you been watching on there, huh? Uh, what do you mean? Hey, I am... I owe you big for last night. It was... It was no big deal. Janelle told me some things. Yeah, well, she... she was pretty drunk, so I don't know what she told you. How... How drunk was I? [phone buzzing Who's blowing you up? S... Sorry, I gotta get to class. Let's go. Same thing, same guy. Let's go. Everybody set? Wrestle. Jeremy. That kid's a freshman walk-on. I'm sorry, Coach, I'm just distracted. Reset. Nice. That's what I'm talking about. Hey. Can we at least talk about it? Why? It's over and done. Just forget it ever happened. Um, does Lexi know? Did you say something to her? No. No, I would never. I just... She mentioned something vague, that Janelle knew everything. Janelle doesn't know shit. She's just some little fucking slut who's obsessed with Lexi. I hardly even know her. Fuck this, man. You should be all set. Yo. English Lit? Hey. Just because you're cute doesn't mean I'll let you cut in line. What does it mean? Can you help me with this? It's, like, frozen in an update or something. Well, we close soon. I can get to it first thing tomorrow. Is there any way that you can look at it tonight? I have a paper due tomorrow. Pretty, please? Okay. I'll have a look. Hmm, your computer is too old for this update. That's what's slowing you down. Can you fix it? Yeah. No problem. I don't even know how it got like this. Like, I don't even browse on this thing. Oh, hey, my boyfriend's here. Gotta go. Here you go. - Is it done? - Yeah. Thanks, English Lit. I was going to see if you wanted to get dinner. You have a boyfriend. Great. Okay. Uh, restore is almost done. Yeah, thanks for lending me your spare. Oh, yeah, dude. WrestlerStud99, what? You know what? I don't even wanna know. It's not mine. It was on some memory stick I found. Well, stop putting foreign sticks into your port, Brian. I thought it was mine, but I think it's my roommate's, okay? I... The folder was hidden in the trash, so I don't even think he knew about it. I guess some student was a webcam performer. Ugh, you look good. You look big. Fucking sexy. - What the fuck? - Yeah. The... The guy on the right is the student. He's in all of them. Oh, you're such a cute little baby. Who's a little good baby, huh? Dude, are they all like these? I... I don't know. I... I only saw a couple. Dude, the sloth, are you kidding me? He's shaking it way too good. No, it's not. It's... It's fucking disturbing. What? Well, Why'd you make a copy of them, then? I don't know. I was curious. I mean, who was this guy? What happened to him? Okay. Okay. I love a good mystery. - Yeah. - Except in our case, a trail of clues is a trail of jizz. Strip naked. Like what you see? Yes, show face. Same time? Okay. Who is that? What the fuck? What? - Bro, bro, bro, come here. - What? Dude, wake up. Come here. Fuck you, man. Just stop it! It's fucking creepy. Ah! Ah! - What happened? - The file got corrupted. - That's the last one? - Yeah. I mean, I don't think the dude's filming anything after this, he's probably dead. Should we call the cops? I mean, this shit happened a year ago. Right? - Yeah. - Anything happen to this kid, they probably know about it. Yeah, I guess so. Can... can you ask your roommate about this guy? Then he's gonna know I went through his stuff. And he's already pissed at me. -Okay. Look, I... I'm sorry. I... I gotta get home. Okay, I got a class early. Yeah, dude. All right. Love you. Get home safe. Jeremy. Jeremy. Fuck. Oh, fuck, Jeremy. Oh, God. Oh, I think I'm going to come. Jeremy, I think I'm gonna come. Hey, what's wrong? I'm just stressed. I don't know. Is there anything I can do to help? It's not you. I'll be all right. Come on. What's wrong? Nothing, I... It's... Let's go. Guess who made the guest list? Get up. We're going clubbing. Yeah, rain check. This essay isn't gonna write itself. No, please. Please, please, please, please. - Yes? - All right. Yes! I can't believe you dragged me out here tonight. Well, I think you should dump Jeremy. Look at all these hot potentials in here. They're all daddy types. I don't want a daddy. Oh, I don't know about you, but I could use a sugar daddy. He just wants to get to know you better. Ugh, bullshit. Oh, thank you. What do you think? I think we can do better. Cheers. - Oh, my gosh. - See you later. - Really? - Yes. Whoever can tie the stem in and out first wins. And when you lose, which you will, you have to suck your own cock. I'm waiting. All right, then. Ooh. Oh, yeah. Ooh. If you don't do what I say, you're dead. Fuck you. Okay? Fuck you. What did I tell you? Leave me alone! Janelle? One more, Brian. You're going to bed. Hello, Wrestlerstud. Like my new friend? I'm your number one fan. All right, who are you, man? Close this chat and I kill the fucking rabbit. Fuck you, you psychopath! Strip. Strip naked. Do it now. Faster. Faster! Ar... a'right. What now? On your knees. to eat. I think it's time for some rabbit stew. Okay, man. Okay. Just take it easy. I'll do anything you want. Just... Just don't fucking hurt him, please. Aww. Too late. Stop, man! Please! You fucking bring him back here right now! I've done everything you fucking asked me to do! Hi, do... do you mind if I sit in front? - Uh, what's up, bro? - You watch the bunny one? Yeah, it's fucked up, right? I wish I'd never watched that one. Hey, listen, bro. It's not really the best time. I'm going to call you tomorrow. - Yeah. Sorry. - All right. I love you. I got you some bennies and an Adderall. Thanks. Yeah. How much do I owe you? I can think of something. I want you to suck my dick. Okay. Where you going, Jeremy? You don't wanna be like Jeremy. Jeremy, what are you afraid of? Why are you ignoring me? - Why are you ignoring me? - Ah! What the fuck? Watch where you're going, dickwad. - Yeah, dickwad. - Where are you going? Animated? Yes. It's a spider piece. I'll see you. Who was that cutie patootie? It's Tommy. He's just a friend. Hey, thanks for ditching me last night. - How was your dick appointment? - Great. I'm sure it was. Is there something up with Jeremy? - What do you mean? - Well, the asshole slut-shamed me on Insta. Why would he do that? Wait what? It was just right here. It's been deleted. I think he just wants you to give him a chance. I swear there's something off with him. I think you're overthinking it. - I'll see you later. - Okay. Jeez! Hey, do you still have that original flash drive? Yeah, it's probably still in the drawer. Okay. Cool. Because... because I was thinking if we take that original flash drive, maybe we can do a repair and get an uncorrupted version of the latest file. I don't know, Jacob. If my roommate finds out about all this, he's gonna be pissed. what are you so worried about? What's the deal with you guys anyway? There's... there's no deal. Okay. I just... I don't wanna create any problems, that's all. - What was that? - What? - Hey, sonny. - Holy shit. Oh, my God, Nana, ca... can you knock, please, one time? I don't knock in my own house, okay? Hey, Bri. It's Nana, hey. Hey, we love you. I'll call you later. Okay. Oh, and promise me you're gonna bring that drive. - Fine. - Okay. All right. Do you know who this is? No. Does he have any mutual followers? - Janelle. - Ah, shocker. It's probably her. She's, like, obsessed with you. Well, I mean, who wouldn't be? What the fuck? Fuck you. I'm calling the cops. Call the cops, and I'll show them this video of your brother selling drugs. 911. What's your emergency? Bring me original drive or he's dead. Jacob! Jacob. - Jacob. - Jacob. Slide the drive under the door. The drive, fuck. Jacob. Jacob, are you okay? Jacob? Sorry, Brian. He wanted that data. I still have the folder on my laptop. Yeah, there's something about me... me repairing that file that spooked the shit out of him. - You g... g... get me out. - I'll help you. Thank you. Oh, fuck bro. - Oh. - Oh, my gosh. - My bad. - I'm so sorry. You don't have to do that. It's okay. Watch where you're going next time, English Lit. Oh, my God, are you okay? Someone hacked my computer. I am so sorry. Why are you sorry? I never meant for you to find out like this. He stole my videos and posted them. - What the fuck? - I'm so sorry. You fucking taped me having sex. What the fuck is wrong with you? Lexi, I'm so sorry. Lexi, I'm so... I'm sorry. What the fuck are you doing? I thought this is what you wanted. Dude, I have a girlfriend. That didn't stop you before. Yeah. We were... we... Dude... I can't. Dude, I can't. Hey, Lexi. Uh... Uh, me and Brian, we were, um... Is this what you wanted to tell me? Fuck you. Fuck you. - Did you set this up? - No! You initiated it. You texted me just now that you wanted this. No. I didn't. Look, I'm going to ask you again. Did you tell Lexi to come here? No! I haven't said shit to Lexi. Say it was you. Don't be fucking stupid. You wanted it. Fuck. Brian? Brian? Oh, my God. Who did this to you? Who did this to you? Jeremy. - Stop. - Sorry. You should see a doctor. No. Brian, you need to, and then the cops. - I can't. - You're calling them or I am. - Jeremy assaulted you. - I don't want to. Okay. Okay. I think someone hacked our texts, manipulated us. It happened to me too. It has something to do with the videos I discovered. What videos? Lexi, please call me back. Please, I... I just need a chance to explain what happened, okay? I don't know who it is, but someone's fucking with me. I... this whole thing is... is not what you think it is, okay? I... I just... I just want to talk, okay? Please give me a call back. Okay, baby? Please. I just want to talk. Oh, my God, I know that guy. - Really? - Yeah. We had a class together last year. Let me find him. I think he transferred his senior year. Here. Caleb Moore. We studied together sometimes. I got to call my brother. What's up? Oh, my God. You're beat up too? Oh, hey. Look, we found out who the webcam guy is. His name is Caleb Moore. Think he's the one messing with us? I could find out. I mean, now that we got his name, I could scrub his Social, the name of his pet, first hometown, wherever else I need to reset his iCloud password and then... - download the videos. - That doesn't sound legal. Yeah. Well, neither does breaking into my house and beating the shit out of me. - Fair enough. - Yeah, um... Let me work on this and, and I'll hit you back, alright? Total eclipses are a freak of cosmic happenstance. Ever since the moon was formed about 4.5 billion years ago, it's been inching away from our planet at a rate of about 1.6 inches per year. Now, this only happens when the earth, the sun, and the moon are perfectly or very closely aligned - with the Earth... - Smear it all over you. Smear it all over your body. Do you like when I get wet for you? Your midterms are due Friday. She's Astronaut 88. And please don't forget there is a lunar eclipse tomorrow night. I'm sorry you got hacked. It must be the same person that hacked me. Why are they doing it though? It could be anyone afraid of those videos getting out. My brother's still downloading from Caleb's account. Good. Hey, Brian. What do you want? Uh... I just... I just want to let you know I'll be leaving tomorrow after my meeting. I'm going to live at home for the rest of the semester, so you will have the room to yourself. I should leave before any more bad shit happens. Yeah! So, why don't you start now? - Get the fuck out. - Janelle. No, she's right. Look, I'm sorry for everything. You don't honestly feel bad for him, do you? He assaulted you. Man the fuck up, Brian. - Hey, English Lit. - What's up? Nothing. I just wanted to thank you for the other night. Don't worry about it. It's funny, I could've sworn that you were going to ask me something when I was leaving. Like what? Something about dinner. Didn't she say something about a boyfriend? Me? I thought you might be hungry. Will this be our dinner date then? If it is a date, maybe we should get the first kiss out of the way. Uh, here? Thanks for letting me stay here last night. Lexi is still moving some things out and I think it's best that I just give her some space. It's no problem. Why is that on? That's how he knew I was going over to Jacob's the night he was attacked. Listen, you sick fuck! You pathetic, lonely webcam freak, I have something that is more powerful than you. What the fuck? There he is. Hey, hey, snap out of it. Focus on the mat. Come up, set the tone. Gentlemen, shake hands. Shake hands. Ready? Penalty Sterling. One point. - Take down, illegal slam. - Damn settle. You're fucking out, man. How does it feel, mother fucker? - Get the fuck off. - Listen to my whistle. And two points take down. That's what I'm talking about. Oh, Brian... Fuck. What the fuck? Did you do this, motherfucker? Fucking kill you, motherfucker. Get off of him. Fucking kill you, you motherfucker! Yes. - Jeremy, stop! - This is what you get for what you fucking did to me. - You asked for it. - The hell I did. Stop, you're going to kill him. - Jeremy, stop. - This is what you get for what you fucking did to me. - You asked for it. - The hell I did. Stop, you're going to kill him. Uh-uh. - Fuck, Nana, what... - Give me that. I told you no guns in the house. - Did I tell you? - Can I just have my gun? No, clean up your room. It's a mess. What is your purpose? You just annoy me all the time. Stop! You're gonna kill him! Holy shit. So this whole thing is Caleb Moore getting revenge on Jeremy for this. I gotta send to Lexi. Maybe then she'll see I was right about Jeremy. Janelle, the whole school just saw me giving a blow job. This isn't our priority right now. No disrespect, but it is for me. Hey! Hey, uh... Jackie, right? - How's it going? - Janelle, shithead. - What the hell? - Why the fuck did you drag me into this? I know you have my shit. I think you have me confused with someone else. Oh, no. I know exactly who you are. I know all about you, and Jeremy and Dr. Walker. That shit's in the past. Then leave it there. Keep digging, and see what happens. Okay. You know, I don't want anything to do with that repressed whack job. So embarrassing. Alright, alright, maybe it's not the best way to come out, but the good ones will stick with you and I will too. Thanks, bro, but I'm more worried about you. If that footage comes out, you're going to jail. Yeah, I know. Uh, that's on me. I should have stopped selling when you told me to. I want to find out what Jeremy knows and figure this shit out. I know, I know. Look, look, we will, all right? We'll figure it out. Don't worry. Just let me work on this and call me back later. What up, slut? I was just kidding. You're supposed to call me a slut too. That's what makes it funny. Jesus, Timothy. That's some kinky shit. Timothy? Who's there? Hold on. I'm coming. Help. Help. What's up? I'm just getting my stuff. Who's this? Dude, what the fuck? Hey, Jeremy. What the fuck did you get us into? It's that piece of shit, Caleb. Yeah, because you broke into his room and you fucking assaulted him. We saw the webcam recordings. Get off me. I don't have time for this shit. Just leave me fuck alone. Okay? You're not going anywhere 'til you tell us what the deal is with you and Caleb. I can't. - What do you mean you can't? - I can't! I fucking can't, you motherfucker. You know what the fuck it's like, you fucking bastard! Fuck! He raped me. I never told anyone before. There was a huge party after we won the match and Caleb followed me home. The room was spinning, and... I knew something was happening to me. Where the fuck am I... where the fuck am I? Who... who? Who... who... what the fuck... what the fuck? Fuck. Get the fuck off me. You fucker! Fuck. Fuck you. Then I heard another voice in there. - Harder. - Fuck. - Fuck him harder. - Fucking you fucking bitch. Fucking... fuck you, bitch. Fuck, fuck. No, no, no. No, no. I... I can't... I can't imagine. You can't. Being in a closet, getting raped. Hey, I'd want to beat the shit out of him, too. Or worse. You were bottling that up this whole time. I'm so sorry. I should've been more honest with you... With you both. And now that you have, we can help you. Thanks. I'm glad I... I told you two. - Is that you? - What? - What the hell? - Oh, my God. No... You guys, we have to save her. What? We just knock on the door? Let's sneak around back, see if we can find a way in. I'm going. I don't see anyone inside. See that door over there? Let's go. Hold on, hold on. How rich is this woman? New York Times' best-seller rich. Caleb? Wanna start some shit. What's up? Do something! Jeremy! - What? - He's playing games with us. Janelle? Janelle! Go get her, I'm getting this fucker. Janelle? Janelle, are you okay? - You okay? - I'm so sorry. We are going to get you out of here. Okay? What is this? Hold it right there. How many more of you are there? Just Jeremy. Oh, and he's fighting with himself? You're a liar. You shouldn't rob a house in a stand-your-ground state. We're not robbing you. You are the kids who have footage on me. I don't care for that. I'm just here for my friend. You show anyone else? No! Jeremy? Jeremy? Jeremy? Brian! Lexi, are you okay? It's okay. It's okay. The cops are on their way. It's okay. - Hey, what did you do? - Oh, my God. No. What the fuck is going on? Did you kill her? I'll fucking kill you. It's okay. Are you okay? It's okay. Joisey! Jeremy, how are you guys? How is it going? Pretty good. Got a little street cred now. Everyone knows I'm a bad bitch. Hey, I'm gonna go get the room ready, okay? - See you in a minute. - I'll see you around. See you. You guys are so cute together. Hey, do you guys want to come over for a movie tonight? - What do you have in mind? - Obviously something from my impeccable criterion collection. Ghost World? Eraserhead? No, just... just surprise us. Will do. See you tonight. See you, Chloe. Hey. It's a little better than last year huh? Yeah. I'm just glad I can finally be myself now. We get to stretch out. Come here. Hey, surprise. - Surprise, yeah. - Nice digs bro. You guys didn't have to come by. Proud of you. And this one, ah! He's a doll, he's a doll. You're both adorable together. Hey I know you're like this big wrestler now, but you better treat him well or else I'll kick your ass. Please. You boys want to eat or what? - I see how it is. Damn. - Come on. Yeah. Yeah. I need some protein, let's go. Come here. Lexi wants a pic. Hey, Tommy, are you almost done in there? I'll be out in a minute, babe. Weird. Did you say something about a boyfriend? Hey, Lexi, uh. Fuck you. Fuck you. Is there any way that you can look at it tonight? I have a paper due tomorrow. Okay. I'll have a look. Here you go. - It's done? - Yeah. Someone hacked my computer. I'm so sorry. Oh, my! It's okay. It's okay. The cops are on their way. It's okay. Hey, what did you do? What the fuck is going on? I'll fucking kill you. Rape him, and I want to watch. Fuck him harder. He likes it, doesn't he? Fuck him harder. You okay out there? Babe? Babe? Babe? No. No. No. No!!
