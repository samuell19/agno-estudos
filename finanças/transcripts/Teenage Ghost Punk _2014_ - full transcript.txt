There's a lot of energy around here. I am the Medium Madame Lidnar the medium! Not some sweatsuit punk with techie tedium! Are your headphones too small? Do they fit? - Mine are... a little tight. - Um, yeah, they're snug. - Comfortable. - Oh, my gosh. Okay. Did you hear that? That sounded like that could be a spirit. Is, uh, is anybody here? I'm here! Okay, okay, okay, okay! There's someone here! That was definitely a spirit! Oh, my gosh. This is intense stuff, Kourtney. If you need to, you can hold me. It's okay. Um, I'm fine. Thanks. I have no reservations chanting incantations! Like Kissinger, I wow the nations! Like David Bowie, go Station to Station! - Sounds like a sasquatch! - It's not a sasquatch! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Okay, guy! Guys! Ignore the hucksters, and the girl speak to us from the spirit world. There's something here. That was definitely a spirit. Guys, hold it together. Okay, if you're here, just, you know, speak up, or something. What are you doing?! You could be a little more professional. I'm gonna go downstairs. Don't tell the guys. Get out of my house! That was definitely a spirit! Definitely a spirit! Where's the lights?! - Hey! - I can't even hear my music, Mom. Be the grown-up. If you guys aren't gonna talk with me, I get to play my music.

She searched for suitable work in West Michigan, but found no marketing positions for divorcées who have been out of the workforce for 17 years, and, because Dad absconded with the F-150, a year's supply of Bud Light, and likely most of their joint checking account, Mother wisely did not see Walmart greeter as a long-term option.

And then Coach Amy was like, "You know what? You should be lead rumble bee, Carly." I was like, "Me?" and she's like, "Yeah." And I'm like, "Cool." But then Jennifer was like, "Carly, Carly, Carly, Carly!" Carly, something weird is going on. I know! Can you believe Jennifer?! No, I'm sorry. Something weird here. There's, like, a knocking noise but I don't see anything. It's probably your little brother. Or maybe... Maybe your house is haunted! I saw this movie once where this family moved into this house and it was totally haunted, and there were, like, murderers and stuff, - and it was a true story. - Carly, I'm sorry, I gotta go.

Is this your old yearbook? - No. - Hmm. No prints on it. None. I can't find prints on any of this mess. So, what does that mean? Teenage vandals wore gloves so as not to leave prints an my beer bottles and old records? That seems far-fetched. I agree with you, ma'am. Here's something else that's a bit off. I found this pipe with all the cigarette butts. - Marijuana pipe? - No, Sir. The residue is tobacco, not marijuana, and I don't know any teenage pothead who smokes from a 1914 Romanic Model 11.

No. Well, unless it's a very clever fake, this was made by the Romanic Pipe Company in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, between 1898 and 1919. If I had to bet it's a 1914. So, what are you sayin'? It was someone from the Antiques Roadshow broke in and drank Mrs. Pallooski's liquor? Poplawski. Sorry, Poplawski. But I'm thinkin' of going back to Jensen. I don't know.

Hey, listen, we ran the few prints that we found over there and, uh, they all match your two kids. None from anybody else. So, therefore... Well, listen, Mrs. Poopalowski. I don't wanna get anybody in trouble, but are you sure it wasn't your kids havin' some friends over? Ghosts. You know, your daughter might be tryin' to make friends and meet people, you know? Look, my kids were both with me the whole day, and they're not the type. Well, I've been doin' this a few years, and this, to me, looks like the work of teenagers. - Or maybe... - Or maybe it was ghosts. Or maybe it was ghosts! That's what my idiot partner says. I don't trust those cops. You should keep your Evil Eye in the right place within the house environment to-to keep the cops in line. I suspect you have raccoons in the attic. Maybe we should call... my feng shui consultant. Listen, I knew this guy in Milwaukee who had raccoons in the attic. They would break into his kitchen at night and steal the fruit right off the counter. Did they smoke and drink and play cards? I think this has more to do with spirits than woodland creatures. Innocent raccoons will breach any opening and then act like they own the place. The lady who last lived here, she used to hear strange noises. Steve would check for raccoons, squirrels, bats... I figured she had bats in her belfry, if you know what I mean. - Well, then she started saying that the house was haunted. - Haunted? That lady's seat was not in the locked and upright position. - Well, I think that maybe... - Her yogurt was beyond the expiration date. So were there murders in this house? Was it built on an Indian burial ground? Native American, Mom. Oh, my God. You know I-I suspect that there is an otherworldly presence in this household.

Oh, I didn't say "goose ghost" but I was getting "Goose." You know? Actually, no, I have no clue what you're talking about. I'm kind of new to this whole ghost thing. Well, they left before we could really have a conversation, so I don't really know who they are. Hello! Anyone wanna have a chatty-chat with Medium Madame Lidnar? Apparently not. Anywho, I will find out who these spirits are. Maybe on my next visit. On your next visit? What should we do if more weirdness occurs?

Now, we wanna make the environment more welcoming so the spirits will feel comfortable chatting with us. Let's light some candles and put on some soothing music. I am receiving strong vibrations of a spirit presence. I'm getting... There's someone here. Get out of my house! You could be a little more professional. - I'm gonna go downstairs. - Okay... um... Don't tell the guys. Okay, well let's go then. Let's just go! So, Carolicious, it's been delightful learning all about Spring Lake and your kids, and your mean old ex-husband... But I gotta say the whole thing about you carrying a torch all these years for a kid you new in summer camp... That kinda creeps me out. Last thing I need is another psycho chick sayin' some other dude's name. You know? No offense, but there'll be no tour of Crib à la Barry esta noche. What? There was no way I was goin' to your apartment tonight. Right. Whatev-skis. This ten spot oughtta cover me. See ya at work. Pow. I felt strong spirit vibrations, but I wasn't actually able to have a chat. It was like the spirit said to me, "Medium Madame Lidnar, I would like nothing more than to have a nice chatty-chat, but we can't because there are too many people buzzing about! Was the spirit actually saying this to you? Well, we wed never able to actually have the chat, you know, because there was all this activity going on. My basement crew picked up some actual readings with our GED and the ACRX. Z-Dog, roll the tape. Is anybody there? Kaboom. I'm here! - - Ghost! Ghost! Ghost! - Definitely a spirit! That's our ghost! That's a ghost! That's a real live dead sassa-frassa ghost! We got a ghost! - - Ghost! Ghost! Ghost! - Definitely a spirit! "Diss Cossack spunk rules"? "This Cossack's bunk rules." Uh, your ghost is a Cossack? Or a sasquatch. Seriously, you guys. I-I think the ghost said... "Disco sucks... punk rules." - Now that's just ridiculous. - I don't think so. You know what, people? I've got this. I've got this. Give us a sign! Wait! Wait! There's a sign on your back. Will you please turn that down? We're trying to figure out this sign thing. I did not touch the stereo! I-I was across the room! - Where's the remote? - I dunno where the remote is! Get out of my house! Okay, not all of you. Those of you who live here can stay. What about me? Can I stay? And my crew? Get out of my house! What does it want from us? Should we leave? I feel like he wants us to stay. Ghost guy? Who are you? Do you want us to stay here? I think we should leave. Let's go to Steve and Stevie's house next door! It's Monday, they'll be at haiku and limerick night. Then-then-then we should just wait on the front porch until Mom gets home. I like when you're scared. You're less condescending. Pretty cool Halloween decoration, 'ey? Anything go on around here? So then they all just go, like, running out of there, and two minutes later, my mom comes home carrying some Halloween decorations, completely oblivious, as usual. So, I'm serious. I think we have an actual ghost. - Weird. - Are you even listening? Did you hear what I just said? Yeah, no, totally, um... You have, like, a weird ghost and then there are people that just left. Yeah. Is someone there with you? Um... we gotta talk. Who's we? You get over here. Hey, Taylor sailor! Hey, Amandy candy! Um... O-okay, so, we... Carly was talkin' to me about we needed to tell you this, and, well, we... Carly and I waned to... Taylor and I are a thing now. I was gonna tell you earlier, but... I dunno, um... Yeah, sorry. Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me?! God! You guys are both so stupid! I know you had to work late last night, but things were so weird. Aw, I've been there, sweetie. Hurts like hell, doesn't it? I can't believe that Taylor and Carly are... God! When I was a teenager, there was this boy. We had so much fun together. He was like my soulmate. You know? And then he... Well... Then he just... Mom... this is not about you. I have to go to school. So, it's late at night, and Hamlet's compatriots are outside the castle, looking for an apparition. A ghost. Marcellus wants Horatio to see the ghost for himself, but Horatio is skeptical. "Tush, tush," he says. "'Twill-'twill not appear!" But the ghost does appear, and Horatio goes from skeptical to scared. And he asks the ghost if he is the deceased king. The ghost says nothing he just stalks off. So now... Horatio shouts at the ghost, saying, "Stay! Speak! Speak, I charge thee! Speak!" Ghost? Are you there, ghost? If you're there speak, I charge thee! I guess there isn't a ghost here. ♪ I haunt your house, I haunt your mind ♪ ♪ and despite all the clues I leave for you to find ♪ ♪ you don't know me, but I know you ♪ ♪ Who am I?

Whoa re you? Brian Flynn! You're the kid from the old year book! Where did you come from? - From here. - From where? Here. This is my house. You're the one that chased all those weirdos out last night. And you moved my mom's old crate of records? - They're good! - And you play guitar when it rains. Do you like it? It sounds like my mom's crappy music, but it's creepy! But... did you knock on my window? Actually, your little brother knocked on your window, and then I knocked on it. But that was to scare him. He's pretty funny, but he's kinda mean to you. What about the mess in the living room? My friends and I like to play cards. We were gonna clean it up but then you guys came home so my friends all split. Speaking of which, I gotta go. Wait! Brian, I still have questions for you! Where did you go? Where did he go? Poker game. See ya later. Well, we were discussing Hamlet. Now, Horatio does not believe in ghosts, but then he and Bernardo encounter an apparition that looks like the dead king. So... Bernardo calls out Horatio. "How now, Horatio! You tremble and look pale. Is not this something more than fantasy? What think you on't?" So. What think you on it, class? Is this ghost real? I think the ghost is only real in that... Bernardo and Horatio think that they can see it. The audience doesn't need to care if it's real or not. I think it's real. Horatio's a skeptic, and yet he still sees it. Right, but the ghost is only meant to be a story advancing device. I don't think Shakespeare actually believed in ghosts or expect his audience to believe in ghosts. Then why does he put ghosts in, like, four different plays? Maybe Shakespeare thought ghosts were real. Amanda? I think that Shakespeare actually transcends time and culture, and the reason why he works so well in the 21st century is because his characters are so real. - Okay? - And... I think that ghosts are real. I-I know they are. Right! Me too. Ooh! I see dead people. Well, some people do. Yes, Tuesday's perfect. You know, I think you're really going to like what Peterson and Cousins can do for Schwinky Industries. Okay. You, too. Yeah. Talk to you soon. Hey, Nancy, you remind me of an overdue library book. 'Cause you got "fine" written all over you. Barry, go away. Hey, Liz. I just got us a meeting with Schwinky Industries. Woohoo! High five! And so the bear says, "What? I'm not even a farmer." Check mate, my friend. Check mate. No way. Check mate. Apologies, old chap, but check-flippin'-mate! Adam, can you guys be quiet? I have, like, hella homework here. I'm sure it's hard to concentrate when my new chum, Alex, and I are waging epic chess. Perhaps you need to take your hella homework to more quieter surroundings, such as your own private bedchamber. Adam, man, you talk so cool. Bedchamber... Rematch? I like to just hang out up here and what the 3Ds go by. - 3Ds? - Yeah, you know. Three-dimensional, living, breathing human beings, like you, or your mom, or your brother. People... with jobs, cars credit cards... So, you can see the 3Ds, but can they see you? I think maybe sometimes. Pretty sure your brother saw me through the window the first night you guys were here. But usually when people see me they get really scared, and he just seemed semi-freaked. Semi-freaked? That usually only happens with little kids. They see you and they don't know they're not supposed to see you, so they just talk to you like you're a normal 3D, but usually, anybody over nine, ten, can't see you at all. So, do they just look right through you? Sometimes they even walk right through you. No way. Does it hurt? No, it doesn't hurt exactly, but... Well if you're just standing there trying to communicate with somebody and they kinda just walk right through you, it can be emotionally scarring. Well, okay, so, the first night we moved in... Yeah, I wanted you and your brother to see me through the window, so you guys would get scared, and, well, go back to wherever you came from. Why? That's so mean? Yeah, well, how would you feel if three strangers just showed up at your house and took up residence? Okay, so if you wanted to scare us back to Michigan, why are we hangin' out now? I don't know. I figure we could be friends. Okay. I mean, I guess you don't really have any. Yeah, I do. There's Earl right there. I don't see him. Yeah, right there. See? He's always pushin' that tire around. I do see him. Hey, Earl, how's it goin'? Oh, hey, Bryan. Swell, swell. Can the girl see us? Hi, Earl! Oh, I guess she can. Uh... Hey, Amanda. Brian's told us all about you. Really? What'd he say? Um... Uh, so long. So, Earl's a ghost. A haunter, yeah. He grew up on this block in the '50s. Got hit by a car in 1957. Sometimes he still kinda thinks its 1957, and stuff freaks him out a little bit. Nice kid, though. Pretty decent poker player. Wow! So you hang out with other ghosts from the neighborhood? Yep, our normal poker game is me, Earl, Hal, Zebulon, Goose Hair and Suzy Q. Zebulon's a farm boy. When he was growin' up around here in the 1860s, this was all forests and prairies, and farmlands. Hal lived on this block when it was still pretty new. I think he went to high school at OPRF with Ernest Hemingway. - Really? - Mm-hmm. So these guys just walk around thinking it's the '50s or the 1800s? Well, some days they're pretty lucid, but a lot of the times they think too hard about time movin' along, and it kinda freaks 'em out. Any girls? My friends used to hang out with this one haunter called Dance Hall Mary, but they haven't seen her in years. Other than that, just Suzy Q. Suzy Q's always strummin' her guitar, and talkin' about peace and the ecology. So, there was another one with a weird name. - Goose hair. - Goose hair? Yep. He's the lovechild of a French fur trapper and a Chippewa Indian. Well, Native America. Okay. Anyway, he's been walkin' around this area since the 1700s. Seen quite a bit of changes. Doesn't really accept it all. Quiet as a breeze. So, can all the ghosts see each other? As far as I can tell, yeah. Most of us can talk to each other too, though you wouldn't really want to talk to most of the ghosts in this neighborhood. How come? Well, a lot of them are older guys that have kind of a lot of anger. You know? Uh, there's this one guy, Vladimir. We call him Vlad the Bad. Everybody stays away from him. Some people say he's not even like a regular haunter. Really? There's also a lot of women kinda float in' around, wearin' tattered dresses. They're really strange and really creepy, so I avoid them as much as I can. Yeah, now that you can see me and Earl, you might start seein' a lot of other ghosts around here, too. - Really? - I mean, I don't know. I don't know why you can see me now, or see Earl when you couldn't before, and apparently some people still can't. I want to meet your friends. Amanda! Amanda! It's fine. She probably can't see me. I'll bet you money she can't hear me either. Hey! Amanda's ma! I'm a dead ghostly punk and I'm getting to second base with your daughter! You rat. Amanda! Amanda, did you hear me? Were you on your phone? Oh, uh, trying to sort things out back in Spring Lake, huh? Okay, well you be careful out here. That was pretty good. Hey. I like what you said in English the other day. Oh, thanks. You, too. Thanks for backing me up. - I'm Jasmine. - Oh, yeah, I know. Er, I know your name from class. Is it true your cheer squad was state runner-up in Michigan last year? - Yeah. - And is it true you were the captain? Well, I was elected to be captain this year, but we moved here instead. How do you know all this? I'm gonna talk to Coach. I'm gonna see if we can find a spot for you. Hey, Jasmine! Give me an O, baby! O, Squatchie! Thanks for the O. Hey man, how's it goin'? Hi. You know him? Yeah, everybody knows Squatchie. His hair has its own website. So, do you get it? I just downloaded that song onto my phone and onto my laptop. You listen to music on your phone? Yeah, everyone does. And more importantly, if you're just grabbing, like, one song here and there, does that mean you never really listen to a whole album? Exactly. You don't have to. You don't have to have all these CDs lying around like my mom used to do, or, like, records, or whatever. Plus, you don't have to listen to the crappy songs they put in between the good songs on CDs. So, like, every song I downloaded onto my phone is a good song. So it's like a giant mix tape. - Yeah, I guess. - Okay. See, there's, like, a time and a place for a mix tape, but you're missing out on albums. That means you're missing out on some great music. Like, what would London Calling be if you didn't listen to the whole album? Just "Train in Vain"? The Clash made London Calling as a whole two-record, four-sided album of meaning, and its got all these different topics and styles, and together it's incredible! Like, "Spanish Bombs" and "Death or Glory" changed everything for me, but I probably wouldn't've even heard those songs if I could've just put "Train in Vain" on my phone. Wait, is "Train in Vain" the one that's like, "You don't stand by me..." No, okay, but, like, except for that, I don't know what you're talking about. That's exactly what I'm talking about. You listen to music on your phone when you have some great albums right downstairs. You mean my mom's crate of old records? You got, like, The Ramones, The Sex Pistols, The Jam. You gotta let me teach you about good music. I'd rather have you teach me about other stuff. Other stuff? Yeah, like, you said all your friends are from around here but they're from different time periods. So teach me about what Oak Park was like in the 1970s, in the 1870s and the 1770s. Crap, I think I hear my brother coming. Mother wants to know whether you need a ride to school tomorrow... Are you... Were you talking to someone? No. No, you're declining the ride to school, or no, you weren't talking with anyone? Ah, parlor tricks calculated to frighten me! Well done, lovely sleight of hand! Or, are you in cahoots with our spirit? Entertaining a specter in your bedroom? Ah! That was great. Happy to help. Come on, let's go show each other around Oak Park. Nobody'll be able to see me but you. Awesome! ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Girls, Amanda Poplawski just moved here from Michigan. Her cheer team was number two in the state. Coach invited her to join us, so let's give her a OPRF welcoming! Five, six, seven, eight! Hey kids, check us out! The mighty Huskies going to rock da, rock da, rock da house! ♪ So, did you have any girlfriends in high school? Well, I mean, no cheerleaders or honor students, but well, I was a dark, cynical outsider with a guitar, so yeah, yeah, I had girlfriends. Tell me about your girlfriends. No, no, I don't wanna do that. Come on! You know everything about my idiot ex-boyfriend! Fine. Well, there's only one that was really worth talking about. This girl I knew one summer. I taught her to play guitar, she taught me about reggae. What about punk? Well, I started out playing, like, Genesis and Pink Floyd covers, and then she came to me and she's like, "Teach me to play "No Woman No Cry." So then I started listening to Bob Marley reggae so I could teach her, you know, and then, and then she came to me one day, with this-this song, and she's like, "I really dig this track. I really wanna learn this." So I listened to it, and it was "I'm So Bored with the USA" by The Clash. And that was it! I was a punk! So Hemingway was an innovator. Basically a punk rocker. Amanda... You have something to share? Well... Hemingway was to 1920s literature what The Clash and The Ramones were to 1970s rock and roll. I mean, Hemingway's stripped- down writing style was almost a reaction to the overwrought writing style of the Victorian age. Okay. So, the punkers rejected this overwrought guitar solo and synthesizer mainstream rock of the 1970s. They stripped rock and roll down to its essence. Hemingway said more with less. So did The Clash. My friend Hal actually knew Ernest Hemingway from the neighborhood. He was, like, totally obsessed with death. In all his stories, the protagonist always has to, like, confront death. You know? And for Hemingway, once you're dead, that's it, I mean, you're done, it's lights out, so, so you have to face it, but you also have to accept it, and the only way to do that is kinda like to live life without fear of dying. With gusto, you know. Brian, how did you die? Well, what do you mean? I mean, I'm not... I mean, I'm talking to you. But, like, you're not a 3D, you're a haunter. Lemme put it like this. How did you get to be the way that you are now? Like, no one can hear you or see you, except for other ghosts and me. ♪ I'm sorry. No. No, I understand the question... I mean, it's- it's a legitimate question. I was playing my guitar on the roof. I used to love playing my guitar on the roof. I would just go up there. It was, uh... It was like my place. You know? Like I could just get away from all the attacks and stuff, and just play my guitar. Did you fall off? No, I was jamming and it started to rain, and, I dunno, I didn't wanna go back in, so I kept playing. And then it started raining harder, and then there was thunder and lightning, and I dunno, everything was just so beautiful and wet, and I just felt so alive. Like I could just play any lick, or write any song, or do anything. I wasn't scared of falling, I wasn't scared of dying, I wasn't scared of anything, and then bam! Lightning strike. Wow. And that was that. So why do you always still play guitar in the rain? Because I can. I love playing my guitar in the rain and, well can't kill me now, can it? Okay, so you don't really need a date for Homecoming. I mean, a lot of people go with groups of friends. I'm goin' with Dominic and it'll be real fun if you went with Squatchie. I think I have someone else in mind. Not Squatchie? I mean, 'cause I could totally make that happen. No, no, you don't know him. I don't even know if he can go. Okay, I know you're not thinkin' about asking your old cheatin' boyfriend from back in Michigan. You know, Evelyn, you remind me of a wide receiver, 'cause every time I see you, I wanna make a pass at you. Excuse me. Barry, I think I hear your mother calling you. Go ahead, Liz. You were saying? Nancy, you remind me of a jigsaw puzzle, 'cause I just wanna put you in my bedroom closet and save you for a rainy day. Perfect, okay. See you at lunch. And on that rainy day, I'd take you out of the closet, spread you all over the floor, and, like... Barry, you gotta stop. Nobody wants to hear your crap. Pow. Come on, go to Homecoming with me. You wanna take a dead guy to Homecoming? That is twisted. You don't act like you're dead. Yeah, but... You said I was, and you're right. I'm dead. I'm a haunter. Yeah, but you're funny, and sweet, and... I need you to be my... Ugh... Ugh?! Look, I haunt this house, and anyway, I always hated school dances, except for the time that we played one. That was hilarious. But apart from that, no. I'm not goin' to a school dance with Little Miss Popular Cheerleader. Fine! I'm the closest thing you've had to a girlfriend in forever, and you won't go to a school dance with me. That's fine. Just go and disappear back into the wall, or wherever you go when you disappear. - Amanda! - No! I have calculus to do, and cheesy boy bands to listen to. Fade out, dude. Go haunt someone else. So, Schwinky Industries was ready to order 5,000 units? Yeah, until Barry told Kathy Schwinky that she reminded him of a fire at a tire factory. She was really smokin'. So Barry killed the whole Schwinky Industries deal? Yep. Five, six, seven, eight! Hey, kids! Check us out! The mighty Huskies going to rock da, rock da, rock da house! New girl, if you're gonna be on our squad, you gotta bring it. O-A-K P-A-R-K! Go Oak Park! O-A-K P-A-R-K! All right. See ya later. All right, bye. - Hey. - Hey. So... What'd Amanda say about Homecoming? Um, not much. She said she had someone in mind, but... I don't know who it is. Aw, man. How can that be? You know everyone! I'm gonna ask her anyway. We're gonna have such a good time. Hey, Amanda! Oh, hey, Squatchie. Hey, um... I've been meaning to ask you something, and I didn't quite know how to do it. So, I made you this sign, and, um, this shirt. With? Oh, Squatchie, is that for me? I'm sorry... we never really... I kind of have, um... There's this guy that I'm kinda of planning on going to Homecoming with. But I shaved my Squatchie fur... I know, and it's really sweet... Look, the "me" still works on your torso and, and the shirt works, too. All you have to do is change the name on the sign. We woulda had so much fun. I know. I'm sorry. There's just another guy. Look, I'm not taking her to Homecoming. I already told her that. I don't get it. She's a swell dame. I'll take her to the dance, ya knucklehead. I'll do-si-do and allemande riot with Miss Amanda. She is as pretty as a daffodil. Can she waltz? I'd show her an enchanting evening. Well, that's really kind of you guys, but she didn't ask any of you. So what, Ace? Maybe I'll ask her! Fantastic meal, Mother! The expatriates of Thailand certainly know their curry! Well, thank you guys for celebrating with me. I really feel like I'm starting to do okay at work. Someone broke in again! Let's call the police. Perhaps it was our resident spirit. Come on, Brian. Really? What did you say? Nothing. It was probably one of those pranks that Adam pulls to scare you and me, or it might've been the cheer squad. I'll call Jasmine. Well, I'd feel a lot safer if we had the police search the place. Make sure there's no creepsters in here. Look at that crap. Who breaks in and plays cards? Hey, did you and the cheer squad break in and trash our front room? I knew it was you guys. You guys are so bad. Yeah, now I have to clean it all up. Okay. Okay, thanks, Jasmine. Bye. Yeah, Jasmine and the cheer squad did it. I'm sorry. They... I told them we were going out to dinner, and they know where I hide the spare key. Weird girls. Whatever happened to just toilet papering trees? Anyway, you're cleaning up this mess. Already on it, Mom. Come on, Adam, let's go find something trashy to watch on TV. That shouldn't be difficult. Brian? Brian! - Brian! - We were gonna clean it up. You guys came home earlier than we expected. So you can party in my house, but you can't take me to Homecoming. It's my house, too, and we were gonna clean it up. Well, you better still clean it up. Are your messy friends still here? Yeah. Lovely to see you, Amanda. Terribly sorry about this mess. It's fine, Hal. Hey, Earl. Hey, Amanda. Sorry about the mess, but we had a really far-out happening in your groovy pad. Brian talked about you the whole time we played cards, and he ain't wrong. You are as pretty as a daisy. Well, thank you, Zebulon. Hey, Goose Hair. Thank you, everyone, but I'm still mad at you, and I don't wanna see you. Amanda, who're you talking to? No one! I'm on the phone! Well, since Brian won't take you to the dance, I'd like to... Pay him no heed. Why... Earl here is a grease monkey, but I'm a classroom scholar and gridiron stalwart! I intend to play halfback at Dartmouth! Allow me to escort you to the dance. I'll escort you to the dance, Miss Amanda. You're as pretty as a bouquet of blue bonnets. Well, thank you guys. You definitely know how to make a girl feel special. That's three gentlemen who'd love to take me to Homecoming. Four. Plus Goose Hair, equals four. Look, you overeager pack of weasels. None of us can take Amanda to Homecoming. They won't even be able to see us over at the high school. We're haunters, remember? We haunt this block. I have a song. ♪ 364 nights of the year ♪ 3Ds can't see haunters ♪ All these things you cannot hear ♪ ♪ But Halloween Night is different ♪ ♪ It's the one night of the year ♪ ♪ All things converge, and if we get the urge ♪ ♪ we can talk and you can hear ♪ ♪ I've haunted this house for countless years ♪ ♪ Mostly I've been unnoticed ♪ When they se me they run in fear ♪ ♪ but, Amanda, you are different ♪ ♪ and when you talk ♪ I'll be here ♪ ♪ Okay, I get it. I forgive you, you seer ghostly punk. But, you guys, I did ask Brian to Homecoming, but I'd love to dance with every one of you. You heard him. We're not going to the dance. We're haunters. We'll be invisible. Your song gave me an idea. You will meet my friends and they will all meet you and we will all dance. Jasmine? Hey. Hear that, fellas? We're gonna do-so-do with Miss Amanda and her friends! Don't hold your breath, Zeb, if you have any. Brian's right. We ain't goin' to no dance. We're doomed to haunt this block. We're trapped here. Trapped. That explains so much. Fellas, we ain't trapped. We just don't wanna move along. Mom... I have a confession to make. That mess wasn't a cheerleading prank, was it? No. Look, I know you miss Spring Lake and all your friends there, and I know you want desperately to fit in here. When I was your age, I was no perfect angel. But you cannot be hosting wild parties in this house. What? I didn't. The first time it happened, it hardly occurred to me that you'd host a party. I mean, you didn't even know anyone here. But I misjudged. You know, maybe you're having a harder time adjusting than I thought. But now I'm here to be the good mom I need to be. Mom, that's great, but I didn't have a party. And even though I'm a sympathetic mom, you are grounded. You're grounded for a week. And if we need to get you some alcohol education... I don't drink! I didn't have a party! - Then who did? - Some guys I know! - Dead guys. - I knew it. Mom, we do have a ghost in this house, and he's really cute, and even though he won't go to Homecoming with me, he's really sweet. Is this one of those internet scams? Those idiots back in Spring Lake make up some fake online boyfriend for you? - I swear, I... - Fake online boyfriend? He's real! He and his friends cleaned up the mess. Go in there and look! It's spotless! You know I'm a crappy cleaner-upper. Honey, this is worse than I thought. You must miss your Spring Lake friends so much that you're makin' up imaginary ones. And you miss Taylor, so you've conjured up an imaginary boyfriend! Listen, I can get you into counseling. I should've known you wouldn't understand. Mom, I am making real friends here, and I like a real guy, and it's more than a crush. I actually know him, and we have these super long interesting conversations, and he's like my soulmate, but it's complicated. I get it. It's natural to fantasize about a boy who doesn't really exist. Who you can't really have. That's not what this is! Ever since your dad and I started to unravel, I keep going back to when I was even younger than you. I keep thinking about this boy I met at summer camp. He was a counselor on the boy's side, and I was on the girl's side. Maybe you need the counseling. He was kind of a bad boy, but one of those bad boys who's actually smart and sensitive. You know? I never saw him again after I was 15. I thought about him all through college, in high school, and even... Mom, you don't get it! I'm talking about a guy who I actually see every day, and you're pining for some guy from when you were 15. You're middle aged! I mean, I'm sad Dad left, too. You're the one with the imaginary boyfriend. He's not imaginary! Then when can I meet him? You can't! I mean, you can't even see him. Most people can't. I'm callin' in the morning to get you into counseling. So, I need you to reveal yourself to my mom. I thought you were gonna tell her about me. She thinks I made you up. So? So, she's so intense, and... I dunno... She's selfish and insensitive. Can't you see that? I guess I don't really pay that much attention to her. Why not? I dunno. I mean, she's a grown-up. I like hanging out with you. We're the same age. Are we? Yeah, I'm 17 and you're 16. Yeah, but if you hadn't... If the whole thunder storm, rain, guitar incident hadn't happened, then you'd be, like, what? My mom's age? Oh, my God, I never thought about that before. I guess I do like her albums more than the crap you listen to. I downloaded London Calling. - The song? - The whole album. I have secretly been digging some of that Taylor Swift crap, so... Guess we are the same age. ♪ God, what am I doing? I'm such a. I, um convinced myself this move would be good for them, but really it was just for me. I dunno, it doesn't really seem like you had much of a choice. For what? A job where I'm in way over my head? I'm totally stressed. I'm ignoring my kids. I'm so selfish. Took Amanda away from her home, her friends, her boyfriend... Everything was going right for her. I think Carly was gonna try to steal that bonehead quarterback whether you guys moved or not. Now Amanda's so depressed, she's makin' up imaginary boyfriends. Well, I don't know if I'm her boyfriend, but she definitely didn't make me up. ♪ Drinking alone in a kitchen and I'm talkin' to myself. You turned down Squatchie because you were hoping to go to Homecoming with a dead guy? Well, he's a ghost. Yeah. Girl, that's a new one. And his friends are all dead, too? Well, they're ghosts, but they're really nice, and interesting, and funny, and they all wanna dance. You guys are gonna really like 'em. How are we gonna like them if we can't even see them? Or talk with them, or hear them. Well, apparently, on Halloween Night, even people that can't normally see ghosts can see them, especially if they're on their own haunting turf, so all we have to do is have a Halloween party at my house. Well, if you aren't completely BSing us this'll be awesome. All right. You know we'll help. Hey, Liz, wanna join us for lunch? We're gonna celebrate 'cause in spite of Barry's idiotic antics, I just found out we landed Schwinky Industries. Nancy, you remind me of a prescription refill, 'cause you are ready for pickup. Evelyn, you remind me of one of those magic 8-balls, 'cause all I wanna do is hold you in my hands and shake you gently, then turn you upside down and see if you say, "yes definitely." Hey, Barry, you remind me of a clock on an airplane, 'cause your time is up. Barry, I figured I might find you here. Patricialicious! My favorite human resource! Barry, come with me. Well, I like the sound of that, Patricialicious. You know, you remind me of steak sauce, 'cause you are A1 and 57 kinds of spicy. Meet me in Conference Room B.

Oh, you and Adam are the best. I love you both so much. But it's easier to be jealous of your kids, or-or resent your husband, than it is to admit that there's stuff that you could've done differently, and, and it's nobody's fault but your own. My own. So you kinda compared Dad to Brian? Yeah. How unfair is that? I was married to a real person, and all I could do was compare him to a sweet bad boy I knew for two months when I was 15. Doesn't justify what Dad did. No, but in the beginning, he tried to be a good husband. Oh, you did what any girl in love would do. I'm surprised you didn't hit me. Want me to hit you now? A hug, instead. You think we'll ever see him again? I don't know. Uh, he usually appears when I call for him, which... I did like a hundred times last night. No response. - Nope. - Hi. Have you been standing there long? No, I just got here. I was over at Hal's. We weren't sure you were coming back. Yeah, neither was I, but I had to see that you guys were both okay. Well, you can just hang out with me. We're the same age. Yeah, but... Amanda to do that, I have to stay here and keep haunting this house, and playing cards with my haunter friends, but... You have to grow up, and move on, and go to college, and have an actual life. You're a really cool girl, Amanda, and you're gonna be a really cool grown-up 3D woman. It's... probably my friends. Hello! Amanda, Mrs. Pallapalooski... We want to extend our thanks for last night's soirée. I know we can all agree that last night's party was the greatest party we've ever attended. Who's at the door? Why, what have we here? Teen ruffians still clad in costume. Too late! My delinquent sister already cleaned up the mess you hooligans made. Hello, Adam. Do I know you? I don't recall meeting, but your face seems familiar. Adam, this is Brian. He's the ghost that haunts our house. The nocturnal guitarist! I knew it! And these are my friends, Hal, Suzy Q, Goose Hair, Earl, Zebulon. They're not wearing costumes, either. Neptune's trident! I was suspecting that you were cavorting with, uh a netherworld punk, but we're overrun with specters! Brian, we talked. We're all gonna do it. You guys are the best. - Let's hop it works. - What? Do what? We're gonna try to leave. Leave where? Hal and Zebulon and Goose Hair used to know a haunter, back around 1930. She left. She used to hang an old dance hall that's long gone. Her name was Mary, and she was as pretty as a petunia. She was always tryin' to leave. She didn't wanna be a haunter. She'd always stand out on Oak Park Avenue, and bum rides off of 3Ds that could see her. But she'd always end up back at the dance hall. Then, one year, there was a party at the dance hall for Halloween, and everyone could see her. Mary must've danced with a dozen fellows that night. And the next day, on All Saint's Day all the 3Ds could still see her. Just like you can see us now. Apparently one of the guys came back to the dance hall and took Mary out for a date. After lunch, old Mary and this 3D fellow went to a field behind the big new movie house, and there... Vladimir was lurking about. And I said, "Jeepers! Don't go near Vlad the Bad!" And then, she looks at Vlad, and then she said she's moving on, and said goodbye. Then, she disappeared. We never seen old Dance Hall Mary ever again. Well, where did she go? The next place, kid. Wherever people go when they finally leave this place. A bit later, a post card was sent to our house, addressed to... Zebulon and me. What did it say? "Dear Hal and Zebulon... It's heavenly here. See you around. Love, Mary." So... We're all gonna try to do what Dance Hall Mary did. What? You're just gonna disappear? But, y... I mean, you and I are in... You like it here. You get to play your guitar in the rain. Amanda, I was wrong. I don't stay here and play my guitar in the rain because I love it. I do it because I'm reenacting that night, because I wish I didn't do that. I wish it didn't happen like that. I wish... Maybe I just wish it was still 1986, and I was 17, and I was just riding my skateboard and playing guitar, but... But it's not. It's not 1986. It's not gonna be today, and it's not gonna be 1986 tomorrow, and it's never gonna be 1986 ever again, and... And, I don't know, um... I'm really sorry but, but it's time. How do you guys know this is gonna work? - We don't, but... - But we all agree. We gotta try. We found out let night that Vlad the Bad is good. He's the portal keeper. He guards a special spot that helps haunters move on. If you do disappear, you don't know where you'll go. I mean, that's crazy. Uh, no offense, Amanda, but you know what's crazy? Rolling a tire up and down the block all day. Day after day... year after year. You know what's crazy?

To Dickensian merriment, and to Christmas toasts! Adam, you don't get the floor all night! Come on, toastmaster. Pick one and go with it. To Oak Park, and all of its denizens, past, present, and future. Hear, hear! Well done, well done. Well done. Nice. Amanda, did you wanna make a toast? I do, but I'm waiting for you-know-who. Honey, that could be a very long wait. - Are you sure he's coming? - I know he will. Are you certain he'll show up tonight? I'm sure he will. It's pretty snowy out the, kid. A little snow isn't gonna stop him. Well, you can't be disappointed if he doesn't make it tonight. Okay There he is. - Hey! - Hey! - Squatchie! - Hi! Hey! Squatchie, I'm so glad you made it! - How's college? - It's amazing. It's so nice to see you all. How's it goin'? It's snowy as heck. Yeah. So, what's in the box? Did you bring us something? Oh, I actually found this on the porch. I just figured I should bring it in. Should we open it? I believe we must! A guitar. - How 'bout that? - A card? You got that? Take it out. Nice-lookin' guitar. All right? What does it say? Atta boy, Brian! ♪
