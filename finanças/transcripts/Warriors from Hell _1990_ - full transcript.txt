SOLDIER: Attention! ORTEZ: Good to see you again, Colonel. -Good to see you, Major. -[CHUCKLING] You'll forgive me for not attempting Russian. I find it such a difficult language. Of course, we will speak in English or Spanish if you wish. You must tell me your request for this meeting. You will have heard of recent events in London. Well, uh, so much happens in London, most of it is of monumental insignificance to me. I am referring to the attempted assassination of President Jamba of Letombo. I've heard a bit of it. The man is a dictator, a colonialist, a puppet of Britain, and for your information, he deserves what he gets. Of course, I'm not suggesting that you would have prior knowledge of an assassination attempt by Letomban soldiers trained here in Gama. I have no knowledge about their nationality. They are revolutionaries, and they chose their target well. There is no doubt that the men were trained here. Revolutionaries are the essential free spirit of the world, a fact that you, as a Russian, should be fully aware of. We have failed once before in Letombo. As a result, there is a new agreement between us. That agreement does not involve the assassination of President Jamba! What is the alternative then, Colonel? I know a very bright, efficient young officer, Colonel Dankov. At this moment, he's waiting outside the borders of Letombo. At my command, he will infiltrate the government and make the country totally ungovernable. I know Dankov. He's a good man. I imagine him being like yourself, Colonel, during your younger days. You will go in your own way. Look, you are a competent man, a militarist, and I am highly impressed. Unlike those crafty political devils of the KGB. [CHUCKLING] Yeah, it's really good to be back, Nkoama. I thought you would stay overseas and not come back. Well, now, I just went to America to study, that's all. Africa is in my blood. Besides, it's my country. But most of all, I missed you, old friend, with the gray in your beard now. Yeah. But things are not well here. Why's that? There is some talk that there are men from the East on our very borders. They can cross any day now. Our President was lucky. Yeah, I read about that in the papers overseas. President Jamba was real lucky to survive that assassination attempt. Legends have been told by our great ancestors, who many moons ago were murdered by the warriors from the North who wanted to own our land, and my people. The dead warriors rose from their graves and took back our land. These warriors, the warriors from hell! [HIGH-PITCHED VOCALIZING] [MEN CHANTING RHYTHMICALLY] [WOMEN ULULATING] [WHISTLE BLOWING] [DRUMS PLAYING] [SILENCE FALLS] [SHOUTING IN NATIVE LANGUAGE] [CROWD REPLYING IN NATIVE LANGUAGE] [SINGING IN NATIVE LANGUAGE] [ULULATING RESUMES] [WHISTLE BLOWING] [ROOSTER CROWING] Tell me again, Father, about our ancestors and the battles they fought. Okay, I'll tell you one more story. This time, I'll tell you about the battle between the Zulus and the Xhosas. That battle took place in that valley across the river. The Zulus were outnumbered by the Xhosas three to one, but under the leadership of the great Zulu King, Shaka, they won that battle. You see, my son, Zulus have always regarded cattle as prized possessions. Which is why they always took the enemy's cattle as the spoils of war. No wonder they have so many cattle. [GUNSHOTS IN DISTANCE] There's trouble in the village. Let's go. -[BABY CRYING] -[GUN FIRING] GUARD: Move, move, move, move. Come on, move! Move! Move! [PEOPLE CLAMORING] Out, out! Out! Come on! Move! Come on! Move! Get going! What are you waiting for? Go! [PEOPLE SCREAMING] Who the hell are you? What do you want? Just the type we're looking for. What have I done? What have you done? It's what you haven't done. I don't know what you mean. You don't know what I mean? You haven't joined our army. I'm a man who believes in peace. I have a wife and children. I don't want to fight for a cause I don't believe in. Peace. You have no choice, my friend. You will join our army. I will not join your army! [LAUGHING] Put him with the rest. Go! Jacob, what's happening? Don't worry. There is a misunderstanding. It will be okay. Now listen to me. We want the men of this village to join our forces, to be trained to fight in the struggle. [MUMBLING] We are farmers. We do not believe in war. We till the ground to grow crops so our families can eat. They cannot eat bullets. You are warriors. Now is the time to fight. Let the women tend the crops. No harm will come to those of you who join us. Or to their families. People of the village, I fear we have no choice in the matter. We have to go with these men. They said they wouldn't harm our families, and I think they'll keep their promise. Son, you are now the man of the house. You'll have to protect your mother. Jacob. I'm so afraid. Come, come, it is getting late! We have a long way to go. Let's go. Jacob. Father, Father... Right, bring the other clothing. Open it. Remove those skins. This is better clothing for a soldier. Put this clothing on. We move soon. Go. [YELLING] [SCREAMING] [LAUGHING] Come on, move. Faster, faster! Move! Move! Move! [INDISTINCT TALKING] [LAUGHTER] What are we going to do? All is lost. We have to be strong. How can we be strong? Our families are dead. Our crops will be ruined. We have nothing to live for. We have to live for our families. We have to live so we can avenge them. Don't give up. Don't let our enemies see our weakness now. Be brave. Be brave. We listened to you, Jacob. You told us that our families would be safe if we agreed to join those dogs. [LAUGHING] I had no way of knowing what would happen. We should never have listened to you. You had no choice. These men are trained killers. You better take a rest. [LAUGHING] Please, Father. Jacob! I'll get you, you murdering bastard. [BIRDS TWITTERING] Good morning, John Kovaks. Major. Hey, drop the Major. You can just call me "sir." -Heard you just got back. -Yeah. Jim Crawford. -How are you? -Hi, man. I've heard a lot about you. Yeah, well, whatever you heard is bullshit. That's not necessarily true, you know. -What have you heard? -[LAUGHS] This ain't a social call. There's trouble up North. I need you and Nkoama to come with us. Why? What happened? [SIGHS] Word's out a group of terrorists have crossed the Northern border. You and Nkoama knows this country like anybody. What about these guys, don't they know the country? They couldn't even find their way in their fuckin' own village. You haven't changed a bit, have you? Not likely. -Hi. -Sam Bhutini. John Ntuli. -How are you? -Fine. -I'm Jabu Nkomo. -Matt Butler. Nkoama! Nkoama! Strange. He was here last night. They're all the fuckin' same. At the slightest bit of trouble, they head for the hills. Nkoama's not like that. I'll get my things together. [GROANS] [MAN SPEAKING NATIVE LANGUAGE] GUARD: Come on. Help! He's sick. Sick? Leave him. You murdering bastard, you can't leave him here. You... You're a troublemaker. Just give me one more excuse, just one more. Hold this. Shut up. The hyenas will eat well tonight. Move out. Okay, come on. Move. Move. Move. Move. -Move! -Move. Come on, move. Move! Move! I've got my bonds free. I am going to make a run for it. They will hunt you down like a dog and kill you. You haven't got a chance. I'd rather die than serve them. Never give up. We'll find a way to get even. We are doomed, Jacob, you know it. You have to be strong. My strength is in my desire for revenge. You are foolish, Jacob. You have no future, death is your future. I will never give up until those dogs are dead. I am going. Goodbye. He's escaping! Stop! [GUN COCKS] You watch the prisoners. I'm going to do some hunting. [COCKING GUN] [LAUGHS] [GUNFIRE] [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] Remember, the only escape is death. Get them up, we move out in five minutes. -Get up! -Up! Get up! Get up! Get up! [GUARDS SHOUTING ORDERS] [MAN GROANING LOUDLY] Get up! Get up! Get up! Faster! Faster! Faster! Faster! Come on! Move! Move! Move! Faster! Move! Let's go. Move. Come on, get going. -Move! Move! Move! -Get going, get going. Move. Come on, come on. Come on, move. Move. Okay, these two. Untie them and bring them. Okay, my friend, you, you're free to go. Go. Go. Go! Go before I change my mind! Okay, my friend, your turn. Go. -[COCKING GUN] -[GRUNTS] [BOMBS EXPLODING] [FLIES BUZZING] [INSECTS TRILLING] [CRICKETS CHIRPING] What do you think? I think we'd better be careful, that's what. This could be an ambush. CRAWFORD: I say, fuck this. Let's get them out. Is there gonna be shooting? I don't believe this. No, dummy, we're gonna have a party. BUTLER: Come on, men, let's move out. [PANTING] Okay. Kovaks, Bhutini, you come with me. The rest of you, cover the flank. Yeah, sure. Hey, Bhutini, come with the equalizer? Blow the fuckers! Yeah, that's what I reckon. Okay, guys. One, two, three, let's get them! I'm gonna check it out. CRAWFORD: Nkomo, no. Come back! Ahh! My friend. He was only a boy, Matt. Just a boy. [BIRDS CHIRPING] [WATER FLOWING] [GRUNTS] [GRUNTING] [INDISTINCT TALKING] -Ahh! -Let's go, man. GUARD: Come on, come on, move! Move, move! Get them out of here. -Move it! -Come on, move, man! [SCREAMS] -[ALL SCREAMING] -Come on! Come on! Come on! Move it! Get out! Get out! Move! Go! [GUARDS SHOUTING ORDERS] GUARD: Come on, out. Out! Out! Move them out! There's nothing more to watch here. [GRUNTS] [SIGHS] [CHILD CRYING] [KIDS CHATTERING] Take the prisoners and lock them up. And, hey! Don't feed them yet. [GOATS BLEATING] [DOOR CLOSES] -Jacob! -Father! Please! Gentlemen. You must be hungry after your long journey. The food is for you. Eat and enjoy. What's the catch? Catch? There is no catch, my friend. We are comrades. And comrades must eat together. We don't want your food! [SHOUTS] Why don't you let them make up their own minds? I have given you a chance to take the easy way. But I see you want it the hard way. This, my friends, can be arranged. I warn you. I will kill you all one by one as an example to others if you do not conform to training. You do not all want to die, do you? I promise you, if you do not do as you are told, you will all die slowly, and painfully. You understand? Dismissed. Move them out. GUARD: Out you go! [YELLS] Where is she? Inside. Spitting and hissing, comrade. [CHUCKLES] That's good. I like a good challenge. [GRUNTS] I'm very tired tonight, my love. Please don't fight me. I hate you, you filthy swine! [CHUCKLES] You want to play rough? [SCREAMS] [LAUGHS MALICIOUSLY] [GRUNTS] Nyet! [SCREAMS] [LAUGHING] I welcome all of you new recruits to our camp. Your training will begin immediately. Seeing that you are all farmers, and wives, and you know how to work with dirt, you will begin by filling sandbags. The tools and the bags are there. Your training will begin immediately. Take it to them. -Move. -Move! [COUGHS] [METAL CLANGING] Come! You have to be strong. [SOBS] I can't take it anymore. Just let them shoot me and put me out of this misery. I can't stand to see that swine, Dankov, anymore. They killed my entire family, the women and children of my village, all of them. I have to stay alive so as to avenge their deaths. You must do the same. Come, get up. Get up! JACOB: She fainted from the heat. But she's okay now. -[GUNSHOTS] -Oh! Get him, he's escaping! Looks like some of the prisoners tried to escape. Dankov is going to have his fun tonight. -[CRICKETS CHIRPING] -[OWL HOOTING] DANKOV: Two of our comrades tried to leave us today. They didn't seem to like our hospitality. I think we should ask them to stay a little bit more permanently. MAN: Please don't kill us. [WOMAN SCREAMS] [DANKOV LAUGHING] And you, my friend, you thought it was easy. [SCREAMS] Remember, there is no escape! Let this be a warning to any of those of you who wish to try. Clean up this mess! My mind is made up, I must join them. After what's happened? It's our only way out of here. Don't touch it, Kovaks! Fuck you, Bhutini. I'll touch it if I want to. I'll even kiss it. Mary Jane. He's right, Kovaks. Leave the dead be. He's fuckin' dead, man. He doesn't know I'm touching him. Besides, there might be something of value in these pots. Kovaks, leave it alone. Come on, guys. Do you believe in this mumbo jumbo shit? Yes. I don't believe in what I just heard. You mean to tell me you believe in this shit? It's not shit! Don't interfere in our beliefs. We don't interfere in yours. Nothing of value. Just a load of ash. Come on, guys, let's move out of here. We've got a lot of ground to cover. Ooh, mama. You know what I like! Lay some skull on me, yeah! [CHUCKLES] Hey, man. Kovaks, put that thing down. Fuck you, Butler, I don't believe you can takes sides with them. I'm not taking sides with anybody. I just feel everyone has a right to their own beliefs. The only beliefs they have is to destroy the lands, and give it to the commies, man. Not all of us want that. Hey, Kovaks, go get this, man. [TWANGING] [KOVAKS SCREAMS] [GROANS] -It's a booby trap. -No. The spirits are very angry, we are all going to die. Let's get out of here. BUTLER: We gotta stay together, it's our only chance. I agree with them. Let's get the fuck out of here, man. -Just keep it together, Crawford. -CRAWFORD: Fuck you, man. You can stay if you want, but I'm going. I can't let you do that. In this state, you're a danger to yourself. Let's get out of here. [COUGHING] [WHIMPERS] [GRUNTING] [BREATHING HEAVILY] Africa is a mysterious place, Matt. It is a country filled with legends and mysteries. An old burial ground is a sacred place. A place that must be treated with great respect. I was right to spare you, comrade. I knew you had spirit. And I thought you would make a good leader. -Na zdorovie. -Thank you, comrade. [SIGHS] I want you to go back across the border. As you wish, comrade. I want you to find the homesteads of the settlers that refuse to leave. And I want you to eliminate them. -When do I leave, comrade? -Immediately. Take some men you can trust. Right away, comrade. [TALKING INDISTINCTLY] ALL: Hi, comrade. My chance has finally come. He's sending me on a mission. But how are you going to escape? I don't know, but I'll find a way, I promise. Oh, Jacob. Oh, Jacob. Please be careful. I wouldn't be able to survive without you. I promise I'll return. I must go now. Take care, my love. You want a drink, Angie? No, thanks, Dad. Don't you think you've had enough? [SIGHS] Never have enough. What else is there to do around here anyway? So, you made up your mind, eh? Yes, I'm leaving with the Chancellors. They're the last of us left in the valley. We won't get another chance. [SIGHS] Won't you change your mind, come with us? [CHUCKLES] Nah. I've lived my life. If I'm gonna die, I might as well die here. You look after yourself. Oh, Dad, change your mind. Come with me. -[BANGS TABLE] -You're so damn stubborn! Listen, this is my land. I didn't steal it, I paid for it, my whole life savings. And I'm not gonna let any commie bastard steal it from me! They don't even wanna farm the place. They just want to destroy it! [EXHALES] I must get a breath of fresh air. [SIGHS] [ANGIE SCREAMING] [MEN LAUGHING] JACOB: Leave her alone! I said, let her go. But this is the spoils of war. Get outside, the lot of you. Now! [ANGIE SOBBING] No harm will come to you, I promise you. [SOBBING] You stay put, I'll come back for you. [TALKING INDISTINCTLY] Come on, let's move. Don't touch him. It can be a booby trap. It's okay. They only booby trap the dead. Where are the others? You won't talk, eh? You better talk or I'll feed you to the jackals. Comrade, let me finish him off. [MEN GROANING] [FLIES BUZZING] You're very lucky, my friend, the backpack saved your life. Hey! What's going on here? Who's this? Quick, get the first aid kit, this man's been injured badly. Come on, move! Well, he's sleeping. I think he's going to be okay. I, uh... I didn't thank you for saving my life. It's okay. You're a terrorist, Jacob, but you helped him and you helped me. Why? There's no reason why I shouldn't save a person's life. I'm not a terrorist by choice. I've been forced into it. Forced? By whom? I don't understand. Understand this. In the past, you Westerners came to our land. We weren't happy, but we learned to live with you. But now, men from the East are coming to take our land by force, coming to rape our women. It's time now to stand together, side by side to repel them. Crawford? Crawford, is that you? Hey? [LAUGHING] [BUTLER SCREAMING] -[SHUSHING] Quiet, quiet. -It's Crawford. There's nobody here but us. You were only having a bad dream. -Crawford... -Relax. [SHUSHING] [BUTLER STAMMERING] It's okay, it's okay, he's a friend. He saved your life. Lie down. We have to move on soon. They're sure to find the bodies out there. But he's still far too weak to move. Oh! -You shouldn't be up yet. -[GRUNTS] I found this inside, I hope you don't mind. Was my father's. Sit. How long have I been here? JACOB: About four days. How did I get here? You brought me, didn't you? Yes. Do you remember what happened? Sure. No, I can't really remember. It'll come to you. You saved my life, didn't you? It seems so silly to say thank you. We must move out of here, tomorrow morning latest. Are you up to it? BUTLER: Sure, sure. In that case, you'd better get some rest. Yeah. Thank you. You, my son, are orkikombe, the black rhino. Together with mpofu, the white eland, you'll lead the people in times of great trouble. -Nice day, huh? -So, where's Angie? You know women. Takes them a while. Okay. Well, my leg's not feeling bad this morning. Will you be able to carry this? Yeah, we'll see how we go. Just help me with that side, would you? Sure. Right. Well, you can carry this for me, if you don't mind. I hope you know how to use that. [CHUCKLES] [GUNFIRE] Ambush! Keep your head down! Wait, wait. I don't believe it. [LAUGHS] -[MEN LAUGHING] -Hey! How are you? How are you, old man? -I'm okay. -Good, good. My friends, Angie and Jacob. Angie and Jacob? We've been waiting for you! [LAUGHING] Shh! Follow me. Come. [ALL GREETING] [TALKING INDISTINCTLY] Matt, sit next to me. [SIGHS] It's okay, I'm grown up now, you know. Yes, I can see that. Used to look after me when I was a little boy. Disappeared a few days ago. I thought you were dead, you know. No. My people called me, I had to obey. Right. NKOAMA: Are you with us, my son? Yes, father. I was taken from my people against my will. [CLICKING TONGUE] And you, my daughter? What's your story? [SIGHS] We bought a farm a few years ago. The trouble started almost immediately. The workers ran away and Kevin started to drink. A lot. And a few days ago, they came. They killed him. Jacob saved my life. So, we have the same enemy? Yeah, looks like it. One day, the white eland and the black rhino will lead our people. The legend is complete. My sons, lead us to victory. [CHUCKLES] No, no, no. Look, we're gonna need a hell of a lot of guns and ammunition to pull something like that off. I see, I see. Okay, in that case, come with me. There's something he's not telling us, isn't there? JACOB: Where did you get all these weapons? NKOAMA: You saw it with your own eyes, my son. I don't believe this. I mean, if you're doing this well, what do you need us for? Across the river, there's a home of these murderers. I want to destroy them once and for all! I have come from the place of which you speak. It would take an army to overpower them. Well, you'll train my army. That's impossible. Not impossible. My men are waiting outside to be trained. Well, I have some unfinished business with Dankov. Uh-huh. And also, I promised someone I'd return for her. Good, good. Now, you'll train my people. -What? Right now? -Right now. [INAUDIBLE] [GUN FIRES] [KNOCKING ON DOOR] DANKOV: Come. Yes. What do you want? We have received a message that another of our patrols has been wiped out. What? Another? There's only one way to handle this situation. Total annihilation! Get the men together, we move out tomorrow morning, first light. -Go. -Yes, comrade. -Boo! -[GASPS] Did I scare you? -Yes. -I'm sorry. Hey, you know, I haven't had a chance to thank you for looking after me. I mean, I really appreciate it, you know. Well, how were you proposing to thank me? Oh, I don't know. I thought we'd think of something. You are better. Oh, I'm better than better. My arms work, my legs work. Just one or two little bits I haven't tried yet. [BOTH MOANING SOFTLY] [BOTH LAUGHING] -Where have you been? -Well, where do you think? -Nkoama wants us urgently. -What for? I have just received news that Dankov is moving his army against us. Oh, no! Are you sure? Yes. The source is very reliable. We have to move soon. But the men aren't properly trained yet. They are ready and willing to fight. We must move soon. We'll have to go like hell to beat Dankov. Well, I'm coming with you and that's that. Come. Nkoama is waiting. All right. Okay, Jacob, you know the lie of the land. What do you think? There's only one way in, through the front door. Damn, gonna have to take out the guard post. -You got the grenade launcher, huh? -Got it. You take the guy on the left. Angie, come round this side. GUARD: Hey, comrades. -You ready? -Ready. Go. Let's move! Move! [GUNS FIRING] Quick, grenade launcher. Let's get those mothers. Nice one, Jacob. Jacob, grenade, come on. [INDISTINCT SHOUTING] I'll get the prisoners, you get him. Okay, boys, let's go hunting. Go! Move away from the door. I'm firing. [GUNSHOT] Come, get out. Let's go, let's go, come. -Thank you, Jacob. Thank you. -Come. Come. Oh, Jacob. I knew you would come for me. I told you I would come back. You follow them. I'll be with you now. [SCREAMING] [GUNFIRE] DANKOV: Are you looking for me, you traitor? Drop your weapons! [GUNS CLATTER] Dying is too easy for you. [GRUNTS] I will kill him. Stay where you are. I'm taking this traitor back with me. He's coming back to Russia. [YELLS AND GROANS] [MOANS] I thought I told you to go, but I'm glad you didn't. So, this is who you came to save, right? This is my friend Matt, and that's Angie. I think we'd better get you out of here, my friend. Give me a hand. Keep an eye, Angie. Nkoama. Hold on, old man. My son, I'm dying. I'm glad I've lived long enough to see the prophecy fulfilled. My son, go, lead my people in peace. Rest well, my friend.
