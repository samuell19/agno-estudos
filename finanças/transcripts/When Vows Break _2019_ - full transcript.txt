But we have not found her yet. - What did her husband say? - She felt bad so she went to the deck. 15 minutes passed and he went to check on her but she was nowhere to be found. We searched the yacht. No blood, no sign of a fight. She was gone. - I'm sure he did this. - Honey... - No. In my heart I know it. Tolan Ferrier is a controlling, abusive man.

And why did you call us down here in the middle of the night? - They called off the search at dusk. - I know. - I'm leaving the island. Heading back to L.A. My business needs me. - Unbelievable. If you didn't push my sister overboard you'd be doing everything you could to find her. - Listen to me. Your sister and I had an emotional relationship at times but I would never do something like that. - I don't believe you. And when we get back, I'm getting an investigator to find out what happened. And I will find out. - You've gotta be kidding me. The police have been investigating this for a week. They think it was an accident. Why would you make that kinda trouble for me? - For all we know, they're on your payroll. No. Back in the U.S., I suggest you cooperate. - Why wouldn't I? - Let's go. - I hope you're telling the truth. Your money won't get you far in prison. - I'm not going to prison.

He wanted to get it for me as a gift. - No. He wanted to get it so he would have control over one more thing.

He said he didn't hear any arguing before Tolan came to alert him and nothing seemed suspicious. - Well, she must've fallen overboard then. - I'm not saying that. - Look Mika, Tolan can buy anyone.

Not even once. - Can I ask you something? - Um hmm. - You don't think Ella would've killed herself, do you? - No. No way. She was murdered. And I may not have enough evidence to prove it now, but I'm not gonna let Tolan get away with this. $840,000 is a great price. Oh yeah, they should be happy with that counter offer. Okay, I, alright. Okay, thank you. - Here's this for you. - Oh, thank you. - Yeah. - Yeah. (Transition Whoosh) - What is it? - An amulet to protect you. Wear it at all times.

It's a software program that allows you to retrieve texts, photos and anything else from a damaged phone. - So her texts had backup? - Yeah. I was able to log onto Ella's phone and access everything that was on there. Look at this. She sent me a text at 9:45 p.m. her time. "Help, Tolan is trying to kill me." - Well what are these numbers afterward? - Coordinates. Latitude and longitude. And if you look at a map it puts 'em out a mile from where Tolan claims that she disappeared. - So this text never came through? - No. She was trying to reach out to me for help. - Hey, there's no way you coulda known. - But this, this proves it, doesn't it? That he killed her? I called Dwayne and we're talking to the police in the morning. - Who do you think sent this to you? It's postmarked the day after she died. - Someone on the yacht maybe. A witness. - How would they've had her password? - [Detective] So let me get this straight. You want your sister declared dead? - That's right. And I want her husband charged with murder. - And this has absolutely nothing to do with a million dollars in life insurance that's coming to you? - Full disclosure here, Lydia. And I told you Holly, she didn't know about that. - Well it looks bad. And all you have is this cryptic note that someone allegedly mailed to you. You can't prove that your sister wrote or sent the text that was recovered. - Do you think I'm lying? - This happened less than two weeks ago, right? - We're not jumping to any conclusions here. - You know how this can look in court. You've got nothing on the husband. And most family members hold out hope longer than this. - She fell off a boat in the middle of the night 40 miles from shore. Of course I prayed that she swam to a boat or somebody picked her up and took her to the hospital. I have been nothing but hopeful. But the truth is, my sister is dead and everything in me tells me that this was not an accident. - As I'm sure you already know, this matter is outside our jurisdiction. So I can't open a formal investigation. Dwayne's a little too close to the matter to interview people. But on my own time, I'll pay a friendly visit to your sister's husband.

He said if I left him, if I embarrassed him in that way, he would have me killed. - How did you do it? - I hired a man in Barbados. (Transitional Whoosh) For a certain amount of cash, Madame Deidre's cousin agreed to help me. His name is Matas. He was the ship's captain. (Whoosh) I told Tolan I wasn't feeling well, that I needed some air. He was tired, taking a nap. I knew that would buy me some time. Once up top my plan was simple. I plant a sandal on deck and throw the other one overboard. I knew in his search for me, Tolan would find it. The fear of doing this was overwhelming. But I had no choice. I knew it was now or never.

I still don't have enough to call this a homicide though. - Oh, okay well maybe we should just... ...call it an accident. - Why this sudden change of heart? - What do you mean? - You sat in my office almost in tears, begging me to investigate your sister's husband for murder. And now it's just an accident? - It doesn't matter what I believe. You need proof right? - I understand your frustration. I'm not saying I'm gonna let this go. I don't think Tolan Ferrier was completely honest when I spoke to him. I'm gonna investigate further. - I appreciate that. - I'll do everything I can to find out what really happened to your sister. - Thank you. - [Harrison] Honey, are you here? Lydia? - [Lydia] Yeah, I'm out here. - Hey. I thought you were working today. - No, I came home early. - Listen, I, spoke to Victor today. And I told him about Ella. - You did? Why? - His wife's a probate lawyer. I thought that maybe she could help us figure out how to get the police to declare Ella dead. - It's not a problem. I spoke to the detective today and she believes that Tolan might be responsible for Ella's death. - That's good news. She's gonna investigate him? - Um hmm. - What's wrong? This is exactly what we wanted. - I know. - Hey. Don't worry. Things are finally starting to fall in line. We'll get justice for Ella. (♪ Ominous Music Swells ♪) - [Maid] What is this? (front door opens and closes) (cellphone rings) - Dwayne, hi. - Hi. Hey I just wanna let you know, my partner is still working on trying to find those off shore banking accounts. Oh I didn't forget about you. - Thanks. Listen Dwayne, I really appreciate all that you and your partner have done. You know I know you're busy and I feel bad asking you to do more. I know you don't have jurisdiction over this matter and I would hate for you to get in trouble using all your resources. - I'm not worried about my resources. I don't mind doing this. - You've done a great job. But I think things are working out with the proper channels. - Giving Detective Newmar additional leads will only help. Trust me. - I do. And if I need anything, I'll call. Really. - Okay Lydia. You got my number. - 'Kay. Night. (Call disconnects) - Wow. - Was that Dwayne? - Uh, Yeah. - You're turning down his help? - No, it... This is just a mess. And I don't want him to get in trouble. I mean, Tolan is a powerful man and he could make his life hell. - I know. But didn't we want him digging behind the scenes? - No. No, I don't. Because if I did then I wouldn't have asked him to stop. He and Mika have done enough. They're risking their careers. - You didn't like the detective, right? You said we needed Dwayne and Mika. What's going on? - Nothing, I just, I wanna do things my way without a million other people telling me how to do it. - A million other people? Who? - I don't know. I just, I don't wanna answer any more questions, okay? It's done. (Cellphone rings) Hello. - Lydia it's me. I just wanna let you know that I'm planning Ella's services a week from Saturday. - Did you just say that you're planning them? - First Devotional Church, 11:00 o'clock with a reception at the house after. - Don't you think that maybe you shoulda consulted with me first? - I'm well of what my wife wanted. - You've knew her for a year. I've known her my whole life. - Look, Lydia, this is not a contest. I just trying to give Ella a proper... A proper celebration of life. - You know what, I can't do this right now. I'll call you tomorrow. (Frustrated exhale) - Lydia, why are you so upset? If he wants to have a funeral, let him. At least you don't have to put the work into it. - Are you serious? - You can plan my real one. Listen Lydia, if he's making arrangements he'll be getting my death certificate. I need you to get that from him for the insurance claim. - About that. This is insurance fraud Ella. I wanna help but, can't you just move to South America and use your new ID to get legit work? - I plan on getting work wherever I go. But I think this could help you. It'll certainly help me. - Not if I'm in prison. - You won't be the one behind bars, I promise you that. - What does that mean? - It's just a matter of time until the police come and arrest Tolan for my murder. - Wait. The text that you sent when you faked your death said Tolan was trying to kill you. And the million dollars that was wired to the Cayman Islands, are you framing him? - Lydia, it's the only way. - No, no no no. You can disappear and he can think that you're dead, but... - And what if he finds out I'm not? - You can't send an innocent man to prison. - He is not innocent. And he does not deserve your sympathy. - It's not about sympathy, Ella. This is wrong. - He threatened me. He degraded me. He manipulated me and the fact that I have to fake my own death to get away from this monster is enough in and of itself. - I don't doubt that he did those things to you. But he didn't murder you. Sending him to prison... - But he would. Don't you get that? If I had tried to leave again you'd be digging my body out of a ditch somewhere. He's dangerous. Now look, Lydia, it's, it's not even about me. It's about the next woman he finds. Trust me. Mine is not the only life I'm saving here. - I know you're right. And I would do anything for you. But I don't know if I can be complicit in sending a man to prison for a crime that he didn't commit. - Putting Tolan away, it's, it's all on me. - You know that they'll call me as a witness. - But I know Tolan. And he'll leave and when he does, he is never coming back here. - I need to think about this. - Please, Lydia. I need you to do this. If he's free then I'm dead. (♪ Dramatic Music Swell ♪) - How much anti-freeze can kill a human? Hmm. And you say you found this under the sink? - I don't usually pay any attention to what people put in their trash. But, given the strange circumstances surrounding Ella's death. - Have you noticed anything else that seemed odd? - Mr. Ferrier was adamant that he did not want me to touch any of her things after he came back from Barbados. It didn't seem unreasonable I suppose. - Tell me about their relationship. (Transitional Whoosh) (efforts and groan) - Tilly. You're early. - [Tilly] I didn't see your car. - It's in the shop. - Is everything okay? - Yeah, why would you ask that? - You seem in pain. - I'm okay, I just overdid it on the exercise. - Of course. (Whoosh) - You think he hit her? - Oh there were a couple other times too. I tried to talk to her about it. But she never wanted to admit anything. At least to me. - Did either of them say anything about this honeymoon they took to the Caribbean? - Ella did make a strange comment when I told her goodbye. - What was that? - Well I said, have fun on your trip and don't worry about a thing here. And she said, "What happens here is the least of my worries." Something to that effect. - Thank you. This information has been very helpful. I'll stay in touch. - [Tilly] Thank you Detective. (♪ Sorrowful Piano Music Plays ♪) - She was such a beautiful soul. She would want us to be smiling today, you know? - I was hoping for something stronger, but this is all there is.

Other than that one, there's not a single photo of Ella anywhere in this house. - Copy of the death certificate. - Thank you. (Front door opens quickly) - [Detective] Officers, secure the house. - What's going on? - [Detective] Start in there. - Detective? - Mr. Ferrier, we have a warrant to search this property. - What for? - You can read it. - All these people just came from wife's funeral. - Then I'm sure they'll be supportive of our investigation. - Lunch next week then. - Okay. - Hey, hey take it easy with that computer. It's expensive. - Tolan Ferrier. - Yeah. - You're under arrest for the murder of Ella Westcombe. - What? You've gotta be kidding me. - You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. - This is ridiculous. And her name was Ella Ferrier. (Handcuffs click closed) - [Detective] Let's go. - Honey? Are you okay? - Yeah. Yeah, I think I'm gonna be sick. - There is some satisfaction in watching that prick get stuffed into a police car. You have to admit. - I can't do this. - You need me to pull over? - No. I can't, I can't keep this secret for her. I mean I know it's wrong, I just don't know how to make it better at this point. (Shuts off the motor) - What secret? - Ella's alive. She faked her death in Barbados. - What? - I just found out a couple days ago. She hired a Bajan man to help her pull it off. Said that she thought he would kill her if she tried to end it any other way. - So, Tolan was just arrested for a crime that didn't even happen? - Yeah. - And you just stood there and you let that happen? - What was I supposed to say? Let him go, she's alive, none of it's real? He can't know that she's alive. - Lydia, come on. I understand that she was scared, but there are other ways. I mean she coulda gone to the police. They could put her in witness protection. - She's not a witness. - Still. - Do you know how many women are killed by their exes? Even if she moved out of state and changed her name Tolan has the means to go after her anywhere she tries to hide. - Even so... You can't possibly think that this is acceptable. - I don't! But I'm not gonna put Ella in any more danger than she's already in. - [Mika] Now Lydia, I don't want you to be alarmed. But I just heard from Dwayne. Tolan already posted a million dollar bail. - Doesn't surprise me. - He also told me that you were asking us to stand down. Why didn't you say anything to me? - Look Mika, it's been pretty crazy. Look I'm sorry, but we've got him where we want him. You know I've had time to process and I just want the courts to decide. Whatever happens, happens. - Okay Lydia, you know if you need anything you can talk to me. - I do. I love you. And I promise I will put myself back together soon. - I know you will. I love you too. No pressure. - Yeah. - I gotta get back to work. - Bye. So, I was thinking, what if I send this in, collect on the life insurance and then when it's time to testify, tell them that I had a change of heart. That I didn't think Tolan did it? I could even testify as a character witness for the defense. - What if he's convicted anyway? What if the IRS figures out you've been filtering money over to Ella? You'd really risk going to prison for insurance fraud? Obstruction of justice? What about us? Our family? - Ella is family too. - You know what? Ella made her own bed, she can lie in it. - Are you really blaming her? She's the victim of a jealous husband. - Okay, no one's gonna be blaming her for that. Okay but she concocted this whole scheme. And she may be fine by putting an innocent man in jail, but I'm not. And I can't believe that you are either. - You have no idea what it's like to live in fear the way that she did, to be emotionally terrorized by your jealous husband. And act like nothing ever happened. Harrison, there is nothing innocent about Tolan. There is nothing innocent about that man. (Typing on laptop) - TF133. $300,000? That can't be right. - [Woman] Thank you for calling Sanders, Price & Wilson. How may I assist you? - May I speak with Frank Sanders please? This is Tolan Ferrier. - One moment. - You know how I feel about Tolan, but this isn't right. And you know that. - Yeah. I know. Everything you're saying is the truth. And I love her and I would do anything for her. But not at the expense of our family. Our son. Oh god. What are we gonna do? - We can't file the insurance claim. - I know. - Yeah Frank, it's just as perplexing to me. I haven't been making any transfers from my offshore accounts. - And we can't let Tolan, despite how much we both despise the guy, go to prison. - Yeah. You're right. - Yeah, thanks Frank. I'll keep you apprised. - No. - What? - [Lydia] No! - [Ella] Why not? - Because I can't. - What do you mean you can't do it. You have to. - I can't. You know that I love you, but I have Josh and Harrison to think about. - How can you do this to me? - The answer is no. I'm not going to jail for you. I have too much to lose. There are other ways to make you safe. - You are not going to jail. And no, there really aren't any other ways. If he finds out I'm alive, he'll kill me. That's who Tolan Ferrier is and you know that. - Here's your death certificate. It's all I can do. So look, you're really dead now. - That's exactly right, Lydia. There's nothing stopping him now. - Hey. I know that was hard, but you did the right thing. - If anything happens to her, I'll never forgive myself. - No, don't let her put this on you. You can only help others so much, they gotta be responsible for themselves. I'm proud of you, I really am.
