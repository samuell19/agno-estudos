(GUN FIRES) (HORSE WHINNIES) WOMAN 1: I bet she thinks she hot shit. She been here one day and already she's looking around for something else. She kind of young to be at what we at. Ah, she ain't that young. Hey! New girl. You never told us where you was from. I'm from a lot of places. Where you from? I was born and raised right here in this town. My folks helped build it. I see they left you a part of it. Hmm. I bet your folks was from Texas. There's something about you that brings Texas to mind. I didn't have no mama and daddy. A farmer found me in a pig pen when I was just a couple hours old. He said the hogs couldn't make up their mind whether to have me for dinner, or just lick the blood off me. Hello, it's washing time. Mr. Chin don't like nobody to be late. WOMAN 2: Well, she didn't have no parents. Generally sit around with your legs spread wide open like that, little honey? It depends on what I'm looking for. What you looking for? What you got? Come on, get up, little honey. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Not out here. Come on in here. You got pretty skin. Sure are a pretty little thing. Yes, sir. Soft and pretty. Strong, too. Hold on, now. Gonna be hurting me with your big, strong self. Oh, I ain't gonna hurt you, honey. Wait a minute. We ain't talked no money yet. Now, how much you gonna pay me? I'm gonna pay you nothing until I feel your body, huh? (GROANS IN PAIN) Oh, God! Let's go see how much you really got now, Mr. Dodsy. Ho, ho, ho. Well, look what I've got. Ah, Miss Thomasine. Thomasine. Hmm. Now just supposing, just supposing... I was to let you drift on in there forever. Hmm? Maybe I ought to throw Dodson in there with you. I wish I could show you your face. You know, them big eyes, they just look like they're gonna pop right out of your head. I just wanted to show you that you ain't as smart as you thought you might be. That's all. Now, you come on out. Damned if you ain't the best-looking bounty hunter I ever did see. I want my money. Oh, yeah, your money. Your money. You gotta sign for it. Right there. I know where to sign. All right. You been doing this long? Long enough. (SIGHS) There's a lot of money for one man. Sure wish I could've been the one to collect it. That ain't been collected yet. He's still alive? Oh, yeah. He's still out there somewhere. Trouble is, you can't get nobody to talk about him. Not just yet. Is he really alive? Yeah, every so often I hear about him spooking up some place. Any notion which way he was heading? I wish I did. I want him. You want that $1,000, don't you? Hmm? Well, you know, it don't make no difference to me who collects that money. I just want his ass back here in this jail. (WHOOPING AND HOLLERING) (WHINNYING) Easy, baby. Easy, baby. Easy, easy, easy, easy. See how that was? Easy, baby. Easy, baby. (WHINNYING) Easy, easy, easy. Attagirl, all right. Good horse. That's a good horse. Atta horse, good. Easy, baby. Easy, easy, easy. That's the way you're supposed to break a horse. Hold it, sonny! Just hold it. You ain't got to be acting crazy on me. What can I do for you? I just want to look at you up close. I been hearing about you since you was a little bitty thing. Running around with them circus people. In fact, some folks say you can't even die. I'm sorry I scared you with my gun. Oh, don't worry about it. You didn't scare me! You just made my heart go to sleep for a couple of minutes! (BOTH LAUGHING) What do they call you? Well, now, they call me a lot of things. But my name is Nathaniel. And you wanna know something else? You the first person who done asked my name in a long time. Well, there are not too many of us around. I just thought it might be nice to know in case I run into you again. (EXHALES) You know, that's a nice thought, son. Anyway, it's a pleasure meeting you. It ain't often that I get a chance to talk to somebody like you. Take care now. You take care. I'm gonna pray for you. Nathaniel, you ever hear tell of Adolph Smith? Sometimes calls himself "Adolph the Butcher"? Phew. Yeah. I heard it. I heard he laughs while he's killing people. Good evening, sir. Kindly fill those up with some of that green stuff you're growing back there. Get around and make sure he doesn't leave anything stuck in the ground. I hope they put you in a cage. Because you're trash. Filthy trash. (WHIMPERING) Come on. You want a name. I never heard nothing, mister. Please don't hurt me. I wouldn't harm you. You've got a gentle face. Won't you turn around so my partner can search you? Come on, turn around! (GROANS) (GROANS) Come on, Adolph, let's get out of here! (ENGINE STARTS) (PIANO PLAYING) (CHATTERING) (LAUGHING) Ante up. You still not doing so good, are you, bucky boy? You talking to me? Yeah! (LAUGHS) There were two young boys hanging from a tree just outside of town. Anybody here know who did it? We seen them when we come in. Somebody probably having a little fun. (LAUGHS) Cards? Two. Where'd you learn to play poker, in the outhouse? I'm still waiting. Where are you from, boy? I want my cards, dealer. We don't want you infecting our cards with your nappy-headed hands. (CHUCKLES) I want to see the color of your money, Negro. (GROANS IN PAIN) (PIANO STOPS) (STUTTERING) I didn't mean anything, fella. I was just joking. MAN: Come on. Give him a break. He didn't mean nothing. DEALER: You lucky, Clinton. That's H.P. Bushrod you almost got shot by. You lucky he had something else on his line too. Oh, uh, Mr. Bushrod? I let somebody in your room. I wouldn't have normally done it, sir, but she said she was your wife. What are you talking about? Well, I asked her if I should fetch you, but she said you didn't like to be bothered while you was gambling. What's she look like? I haven't seen her in a long time. Oh, well, if you don't mind me saying it, sir, she's the most prettiest colored woman I've ever looked at. Thank you, Ricky. How you do, Mr. Bushrod? I knew he wouldn't stop me if I said I was your wife. Keep shaking your head like that and it's gonna fall off. I ask you, how you do? I do fine, Thomasine, I do fine. I just never thought I'd see you again. Here I am. And you look good. Damn, you look good. Come on in. Got a lot to talk about. Anyway, um, I been a whole lot of places since I seen you last. I bet you have. Kind of beginning to feel like a hopping bug. So when this... This guy came along, he kind of gave me something to lean on. He's the one who's coming in on the stagecoach tomorrow, right? Yep, that's him. What does he do? Well, what difference does it make? I just wanted to know, that's all. You know, up until a few days ago I thought you were dead. How'd you find out I wasn't? I met a marshal who was looking for you. His name was Bogardie. You met old Bogardie, huh? Mm-hm. I did something to him once. Something that made him look like a fool in front of a lot of people. He's been wearing me to death ever since. That's another reason I've been so tired. That, and the fact that there's somebody out there I been looking for. Somebody out there I gotta kill. I heard about it. I'm really sorry about what they did to your sister. So am I. Hey. Look at this. You wanna see something? All of them are you. Where'd you get this? Well, every time I'd hit a new town, I'd go to the jailhouse, and blink my eyes at the sheriff. Soon as he turned his back, I'd just snatch them off the wall. You know I almost broke my neck trying to get those things? One time he turned around too fast, and I was running out the door, and I ran smack into one of them new riding machines. You ran into an automobile? Mm-hm. (LAUGHS) You know, there's some places east of here where you can find four or five of them in the same town. You know, sometimes I feel sorry for horses. It must make them feel real sick to see one of those monsters rolling along carrying four and five people at the same time. Well, one thing, though, you never have to worry about a horse running out of gas. (CHUCKLES) Whoever called this place the Last Town sure knew what they were talking about. Don't talk so much. I'm so glad you're still alive. Well... Looks like this one might be even easier than the last one. There won't be nothing to it. Yeah. It's gonna be a while before it gets open, so I'm gonna see if we can scrape up a couple of drinks. Damn good idea! Adolph! I have no protection. You won't shoot an unarmed man, huh? (GRUNTS) (GROANS) I don't care what you do to me, you savage. It ain't gonna bring back your ill-bred sister. (MUTTERING) Now, don't make us kill you, son. Just drop your gun real easy like. That man out there is Adolph Smith. He's wanted for murder. You better go take a look at him. Hold on, sheriff. Don't you move, Bushrod. Been thinking about you, Bushrod. Ever since you broke out of jail. You know, there was a woman asking about you the other day. Just made me want to come out and start looking for you again. U.S. Marshal Bogardie. Fella's wanted for murder, Sheriff. He have anything to do with that over there? SHERIFF: Looks like it. Why don't we just do the government a favor and get rid of him right here? You'd be making a mistake, Sheriff. That post is no good anymore. He's lying! Well, we gotta at least check his story out! It won't take but a few minutes. It only took a few minutes for him to kill those men over there, sheriff. Now, you good people, you got to listen to me. You got to remember that this is your town, and you can't let nobody come in here and break your laws! You got to take another look at them bodies on the ground over there, and think about your children. You owe it to them to help me eliminate this vicious killer! Now look, you can't do this to my town. I won't allow it. Sheriff, if you just... Get your gun on him! Now, when he comes to, he's gonna realize that we... (PEOPLE SCREAMING) Drop it, drop it! Leave it down! Leave it down! I'm really sorry I got you into this mess. Ain't anything to be sorry about. I knew what I was doing. The only problem is, what are we gonna do now? Maybe I can get some work breaking horses. And how much does that pay? If I really work at it, maybe two, three dollars a day. (LAUGHS) Two or three dollars a day? I mean, what are we going to sleep on, the horses? I don't think that's funny. What the hell you laughing at? Hey, baby, I'm not laughing at you. What you laughing at then? Ain't nobody else here but the fish! Well, it's gonna take a lot more than that! Look, I don't know what you been used to living off of, but $3 a day is a lot of money if you handle it right. Okay, baby. I mean, but before, I mean, there was just one of you, and it was enough. But now there's two of us. You know. I'd like a house, and horses. A little piece of land. I mean, wouldn't you like to be breaking your own horses? How do you feel breaking those horses and just never seeing them again? Okay, Thomasine. Whatever we have to do to stay alive, I don't care what it is, we'll do it, all right? And everything that you want... I'll get it for you. I promise. Okay. You know I ain't never had a family before, so I'm holding you to that. Why don't you just go in the water and wash yourself? You're the dirtiest. You go first. Try it! * Thomasine and Bushrod * Thomasine and Bushrod "Last seen in the company of an unidentified colored girl"? Unidentified colored girl my ass. I'll show them how unidentified I am. What's that in your hand? Nothing. I went by the stable to see if I could get work. They didn't have anything for me to do. We don't want to stay in this old town anyway. -Let's get outta here, then. -Let's go in. I want us to take a picture together. Baby, you must be going batty. We ain't got no time to be doing no posing! There's 200 people out here looking for us! It ain't gonna take no time. We ain't never had a picture together. We want to take a picture together. How long is it gonna take? Shouldn't take too long. Okay, um, where do you want us to stand? Over there, under the light. Now just relax for a minute, and we'll be ready. Hey, wait a minute. What can I do for you now, young lady? I wanna know, what side do I have to be on to come out on the left of the photograph? Well, now. Do you mean on the left side of the actual photograph, or the left side of the person looking at it? We'll go again. Okay, this is the way I wanna be. Ready? When are we gonna get the picture? Well, it's just not gonna drop out. Come back in a couple minutes, it'll be ready. I just asked you a simple question, now don't you go be making fun of me, now. Come on. You gotta learn how to control that temper of yours. I didn't like the way she was talking to me. Bushrod... Ain't that pretty? -Is that a car over there? -Yeah. -Let's go look at it. -Okay. Look at this! I want a car just like this one. This car, where do you think he got it from? I'm a horse man, I don't know anything about cars. Hey, hey, hey... You don't have to be afraid, boy! I ain't gonna hurt you! I know it ain't every day your gal gets to rub on a pretty car like that. Would you children like to go for a ride? Leave them alone, honey, they didn't mean anything. Quiet, Charlotte! You know what old Abe Lincoln said. We gotta be nice to our negroes. What you do for a living, mister? My name's Tyler, son. I own this town and everything in it. Including this here bank! (STAMMERING) Look, mister, we got a little money saved. You think maybe it would be safe if we put it in your bank? You wait right here, Charlotte, I'll be right back. Open it up, Farley! We've got a couple of visitors who want to look around. We got the best safety record in the country. Why, our security measures are one you won't find anywhere. That means our money will be safe in here. MR. TYLER: Oh, absolutely. We've got over $2 million in assets. All in there? -Why, we couldn't keep that much money in there. -Oh. Get the money. You're not seriously thinking of robbing us, now, are you? Farley? This boy's from one of those minstrel shows? Ah! I think you'd better stop moving if you wanna stay alive. Get over there! I guess you and that gal are smarter than I thought, boy. Get the money. Step aside, baby. No! Get in there! Get in there! Get over there! Sit over there, quick. -That's all the cash we have. -Well, what's in there? There's just trust deeds and papers in there! They wouldn't do you any good! Make him open those drawers. There's just writing papers in there! Then open the damn drawers. I wanna write a letter. Open the drawers! You made me look like a fool in front of my woman. Before I've finished with you, you're going to be sorry you ever saw me! Now get out of here! THOMASINE: If you try to follow us, we're gonna kill your husband. -I gotta go get our pictures. -Come back here. What are you doing? Come back here! (ENGINE STARTS) -You ain't gonna get away with this, boy! -We'll see about that. Got a lot of friends around here. Maybe Abe Lincoln will help you. You'll be sorry the day you tried this. Come on! Why don't we leave him here? No, no, we got some talking to do. THOMASINE: You really look good in that coat! BUSHROD: You really think so? THOMASINE: Yeah! Hey, why don't we get us some fancy clothes? -What? -Why don't we get us some fancy clothes? That's good. Maybe I can shave this beard off, and people won't recognize me. Hey, my man wants to shave his face. What you think about that, Mr. Tyler? (LAUGHS) -Hey, why's he mad at us? -I can't hear you, what'd you say? Why's he mad at us? Yeah! Why's he mad at us? 'Cause Abraham Lincoln lied to him! (BOTH LAUGHING) (CHOKING) (PANTING) Baby, baby, baby... Baby... Wait for me. (PANTING) (GRUNTING) (SOBBING) Baby, baby, baby... Baby, baby... Baby, baby... It's my fault. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I told you to leave that man in town. Look, I said I was sorry! That's all I've been hearing since I've been with you. Well, I'm sick and tired of your sorrys. And I'm tired of having to tell you what to do all the time! Let me tell you something. I'm tired of you trying to tell me what to do all the time! The only reason I haven't kicked your ass to China is because I know what you must have gone through trying to stay alive by yourself. Don't you think you're doing me favors. I was making it by myself before you came prancing into my life with all your mystery shit! If you don't like my so-called mystery shit, you should have stayed in that town and waited for that guy on that stage. And while we're talking about it, the only reason I put up with your trying to be a man. Trying to be a man? Trying to be a man? (GROANS) I'm sorry. I love you. I love you too, baby. I love you too. It's gonna be all right. It's gonna be all right. Okay? Come on, come on. Come on. I guess she wanted to be on the left side so her name would come first. Was Bushrod against her name coming first? I don't think he knew about it. How do you know that? Well, he was out in the car holding onto Mr. Tyler. He didn't say much in the bank, either. It looked to me like she was running the show. He went along with everything she said, huh? MAN: Well, there was one time when he gave her a kind of crooked look. What the hell is a crooked look? Well, I mean, it was something she did he didn't like. Try to remember what it was, now, it might be important. Of all the things I could think of, I'd never picture them robbing a bank. Lady, hush. Yeah, that was it. I remember now. It was when he wanted to do something, and she told him to do something else. Now, that's when the crooked look came in. You've all been very helpful. WOMAN: Oh, where are you taking the poster? Oh, I'm just taking it back to the sheriff's office. Well, uh, tell Sheriff McCullers to save me the poster. You know, just in case they get famous. I plan to have them inside a couple of weeks, lady. What the hell makes you think they're gonna live long enough to become famous? Well... They're so bold. I mean, look at what they did. Negroes don't do things like that. Negroes sing and dance and steal chickens. They don't rob banks. (BELL DINGS) Good morning, folks. My name is Mr. Bushrod. This pretty young lady here is Miss Thomasine. We're here to rob this bank. (GUNS FIRING) Hi, hi, how you doing? (ALL CHATTERING) Juan, como esta, como esta, eh? (WOMAN THANKS IN SPANISH) BUSHROD: Yo, Rudy! Como esta, eh? THOMASINE: There must be someone who could... How's your wife? And your baby? We gotta get going now, so move back now. Move back. We don't want to hit you. Bye! Bye! Bye! Bushrod. Bushrod, get up. It's time to go to work. Come on, baby. All right, all right, I'm up, I'm up. I'm up. I had a bad dream. You didn't dream we got caught, did you? No, no, no... That's good. 'Cause I'd really hate to read what they write about us then. You still reading that newspaper? Yeah. Let me read what they wrote about us today. "And while robbing the bank over in Terryville..." Terryville? That's what it says. "...she again tried to force him. "Only this time, he viciously slapped her in the face." They're really trying to get us, aren't they? Oh, wait, but listen to this one now. I know it made them sick to have to print this. "In spite of their fighting all the time, "the public follows their every move with some kind of strange fascination." "Strange fascination"? "Among the less fortunate, they have also become folk heroes." "The less fortunate"? Look at it! That's what it says. I guess that's another word for poor folks. Hey, baby. Look at that. Front page. "Thomasine and Bushrod." At least that picture's a little clearer. You know, that last one was so dark, you couldn't even see us. You know, that's really something. I mean, they got us robbing banks that we haven't even seen before. You know, there's someone out there who really wants us caught awfully bad. Well, look, we both know who it is, right, so... Why don't we just get ourselves together and get on out of here? (GUNS FIRING) BUSHROD: * If I was a coyote * Living on a prairie * Find me a girlie * By the name of Mary * La, la, la, la, la... Dammit! * La, la, la What'd you do, burn your hand again? What does it look like I'm yelling for? I don't know. You been yelling so much recently, it could be anything. Well, I wouldn't be complaining so much if you'd stop giving away all our money. Before we go further, let's just get something straight. No, you need to get something straight. (SIGHS) Now, I'm just as tired of my yelling as you are. But I'm even more tired of the fact that we're barely staying alive while those poor people you're helping are living and eating better than us. But one thing would help for sure in this, if you'd stop running your mouth and learn to cook. I mean, you burned over half of the meat we brought home. Would you get it through your thick head that this is not a cotton-picking home? Now, all you have to do is just lay up against that tree, and all of a sudden it becomes your rocking chair. Now, see... Now, that's why we didn't stay together the first time! We're back at that again, huh? I can't even talk to you, can I? You just don't even listen to me. -Where are you going? -I'm getting away from you, because I got some thinking to do. Be careful. Don't go too far. (SCOFFS) You really think I can't make it without you, don't you? Just be careful. (CHICKENS CLUCKING) MAN: How is Bushrod? He's okay. He's at home. WOMAN: Hello, Thomasine. I'm so glad to see you. I'm glad to see you too. How you doing? I'm glad you're out of bed. WOMAN: Bushrod! Bushrod! It's Thomasine! It's Thomasine! They got her in the old church. (SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) -There's no sense in it. -Right. Yeah. Different systems. So that's what we do. (THUDDING) I think we ought to check on Thomasine. There's no reason for it. She's tied up in the confessional. Yeah, I guess you're right. I still think we ought to check on her. Fine. (PUNCHING) * All y'all knows That Jesus saves * * Jesus saves * Jesus saves * Jesus saves * All y'all knows That Jesus saves * * All y'all knows That Jesus saves * * All y'all knows That Jesus saves * (INAUDIBLE) THOMASINE: Where the hell are all the people? BUSHROD: It's probably just one of those sleepy towns. THOMASINE: The way our luck has been running, the banker won't even get out of bed this morning. Something's wrong, baby. I feel it. (BOGARDIE YELLING) (FIRING) (CONTINUES FIRING) THOMASINE: Hope these cliff people are friendlier than the folks we just left. BUSHROD: I got a funny feeling I've been here before. THOMASINE: Now, look, don't start talking that other world stuff. It's scary enough just being up here. BUSHROD: I keep forgetting you're afraid of heights. I think we can go right up here. THOMASINE: Oh, Christ. What is it? What's wrong, Seldon? Tell me. BUSHROD: There's nothing wrong, ma'am. We just stopped to get some water. Oh, we don't have no water to spare. I think you better just move on. Seldon, take me to them. Tell me, what is your name? My name is Bushrod, ma'am. This is my wife, Thomasine. Bushrod. Seldon, water. Back around one of them caves. It's probably where they've been hiding all along. We can't go up there with guns. The cliffs are like holy grounds. I don't care nothing about no holy park. Probably got a friend up there. It's the only road out of here, right? -Yep. They gotta come this-a-way. -All right. Now, you take the car and you go back to town. And you bring me some men who ain't afraid to go up there. You hear me? Yep. All right. (THUNDER RUMBLING) Spark off! Is Seldon your... Your son? Seldon is my eyes. I have no children. How long have you been traveling? Ever since Seldon was six years old. I really don't know how long. You know, we was just talking, we're on our way to Boley to join the rest of our people. The going is hard, but we're gonna make it anyhow. You know, it'd be a lot easier if folks like y'all would join us. We might join you later on. Yeah, I understand. Pecolia, you said earlier that you knew my parents. I knew them when they were killed. Yeah, Pecolia's father was chief of the Comanche Nation. Your mother was also Comanche. Her name was Laure. When she was only a seed, she rode with her father in raids against the intruders. Your father was tall, straight like tree, strong and blacker than the great buffalo. Pecolia, we'll have to go now. You love each other, don't you? You must watch the wheels of your home. Be careful of your brother. Go to her. You don't have much time. SELDON: I'll show you the way out now. (SIGHS) God, I hope it's empty. I'm tired of sleeping in this truck with all these holes. I don't see any signs of life or horses or anything, so why don't we just go to look at it? THOMASINE: I don't see any movement. THOMASINE: * Our house, we got a house You sound happy. We got a house! * We got a house Hmm. I'm think I'm going to hide this reward. How does that look, baby? Yeah, that's good. Won't you put those guns down sometime? I gotta keep them oiled. I mean, just in case we use them. Here, have some wine. It'll relax you. I already... I already drank half of it. Drink some more. Oh, now. You sure are proper. It ain't like we just met, you know. What you think you gonna catch? You changed your mind or something? Huh? Huh? (LAUGHING) He was-- He was halfway right. What you mumbling about now? -That boy on the desk, back in the Last Town? -Mm-hm? He said, um, you were the most prettiest colored lady he had ever seen. But what he meant to say, was that you were the prettiest thing he'd ever seen. Period. You told that blind woman that I was your wife. Doesn't it make you feel kind of funny to say that? I thought we weren't gonna talk about Pecolia. It's okay. I'm all right now. Um, because if you can't trust your brother, then you can't trust nobody. That's right. And if you can't trust nobody, there ain't no sense having a word called trust. (BOTH LAUGH) Where are you going? Come back here. Wow, you... You got a loud stomach! I wonder how it'd feel to hear a little Bushrod, you know, moving around inside. We ain't got time for that. It's hard enough just keeping us alive. Yeah. I guess you're right. Well. Anyway. We got a house, at least for a little while. Don't sound so sad. Don't be so sad. There you go. You got enough shells here to shoot a moose! You must be planning a lot of hunting. We're gonna rob a bank. CLERK: You're gonna rob a bank, huh? Well, just be careful you don't get caught. Oh, we're gonna try not to. How much do I owe you? No. You can pay me for it later, if you don't have the money now. I never did like no bank owners anyhow. That's nice. That's nice. You make a move, and I'll blow your friend's eyeballs all over that nice, clean dress. And don't be making no fast moves. My name? Mr. Jomo. Drop your gun or you gotta go. Jomo. Hey, you look good! You look good! You look good too, guy! Would you two stop hugging and let's get out of here! She got a point. Come on, Jomo. Come here. I gotta get my horse, man. You don't need no horse. You can get a horse anytime! What, are you crazy? What kind of man leaves his horse in his right mind? -We gotta go. -Go ahead, man, I catch up with you! Go! Go! Get the old buggy out of here! (GUNS FIRING) (WHINNYING) Come on, let's get out of here. (WHOOPING) First time I ever tasted onion soup that tasted like peas. (LAUGHING) So after that, man... Let me see. I go down to Texas for a while. Everybody there, they're putting up barbed wire all over the place. So I had to giddy up and go. All that time you never thought about going back to your homeland? Jamaica. Man, I told you, I in that town because I had no money. I was looking for something to steal. Now, how you think I'm going to get a ticket back to Jamaica, huh? Isn't it funny, how we always bump into each other at just the right time? It's just me magic working, man. It's just me magic. I know who shot you. What I want to know is something about him. What did he look like? Did they call him by name? Jenkins, now come on, don't you go and die on me, boy! Not yet! Not till we know something about the one that put the bullet in your backbone! What's the matter with the way I speak English? (IMITATING) "What's the matter with the way I speak English?" I think you both need help. (CHUCKLING) Let's get into something. (PLAYING BLUES TUNE) * See, I started out in Boley * I rob a train For meat and bread * * I got all shot up in Waco * And everybody Think Jomo dead * (ALL LAUGHING) * But I keep me lucky hat Glued to me head * * And I ain't never had No problems * * Till I met a woman Who made me stop, whoo * Oh, man. Man, she had pretty brown eyes. And her color was a teasing tan. And she smiling. She smiling the prettiest smile you ever want to see. Then she leave Jomo for another man. Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, man. Weren't you supposed to be singing happy songs? Don't be singing all those sad songs like that. Hey, Bushrod, you can't be happy all the time. Hey, you just sing what you want to. Wait a minute, you don't be telling him what to sing! When my friend comes to my house, he sings what I want him to sing! THOMASINE: Oh, hush. Hey, you just sing what you wanna sing. Hey, look, don't start no argument 'cause of me. And in the first place, I can never be the friend of nobody who play the guitar bad as you, man. -Oh! -And in the second place... In the second place... No, you got to listen to the second place! The second place, man, this ain't your house. No, if my memory serves me correctly, the law call it, uh... Porching? Yeah, porching! (JOMO LAUGHING) (ARGUING INDISTINCTLY) See the chip? Knock the chip off my shoulder. Knock the chip off my shoulder. Knock the chip off? Off my shoulder. The wind, the wind! The wind knocked it off that time. You got one more time. You just knock the chip off... Oh, knock the chip off your shoulder! -Don't make me knock the chip off of both your shoulders! -(CLAMORING) The man need a whipping for playing the guitar so badly! Don't hurt him! Don't hurt him! BUSHROD: Wait, wait, wait... She's doing all this talking about I can't play, and you can't sing, and all that kind of stuff. Let's see her do a song. -Come on. -Yeah! She has done all this running of the mouth. Come on, let me see that hoe dance that you tell me about. The hoe dance now? A hoe dance, yeah. Come on. Yeah, that's right, Thomasine. (COUGHS) What are you talking about, Jamaica? Was he wearing a long, funny-looking hat? Did he wear two long pearl-handled guns? Huh? Can't be nobody else but him. His name was something like... Jomy, or Joho. Jomo. Jomo J. Anderson. Thomasine and Bushrod. Like a wild stallion, he'll be making a mistake soon enough. How you doing? Hi. The truck's gone. Where's Jomo? He said he had to go in town to do something. He took off right after you left. You mean he's riding that truck around in town with all those bullet holes in it? Who you worried about, him or the truck? What kind of stupid question is that? I... I didn't mean anything by it. Forget it. Well then what are you talking about, then? What's wrong with you anyway? You been moping around the last couple days. I don't know how to tell you. Tell me what? We're gonna have a baby. Gonna what? You're not... Are you serious? You're not mad at me, are you? Let me look at you. Turn around, turn around. It's too soon. You can't feel anything. How long has he been in there? Just started. Are you serious? You're really gonna have a baby? You're squashing me. You're not mad at me, are you? No. I been wanting a baby ever since I was a baby. You know, we have to make sure that this next job is the last one. We'll go across the border and get us a little ranch. And we'll just stop running. You know? And you and Jomo can have all the horses you want, like we talked about, huh? Yeah. Yeah, maybe. Yeah. That will work, that will work. Hey, I got some rabbits. I got two rabbits today. So why don't we go inside and get you outta the sun? I gotta take care of you now. Well, I'm gonna have to eat enough for two, now. Okay, well get your peas over there and let's go. Okay. (JOMO SINGING) Hey now, hey now, hey now! * And never had no problems * Ah! Homeboy! Homegirl! -Come here! -(HONKING HORN) Homeboy! Homegirl! Come see what Jomo got. Where'd you get it, Jomo? Oh. I tell you the whole story later, man. Get in! Where'd you get the car, Jomo? It's a present from me to you. You can pay me back when we start selling horses, huh? Jomo, where did you get it? Oh, what's the matter? Oh. Oh, you don't have to worry. Nobody follow Jomo. Are you sure? Little sister, when Jomo say nobody follow Jomo, nobody follow Jomo. Okay? Okay, and tell us where you got it. Ah! Bushrod. This old, nasty man on the side of the road, so we stop to have a conversation. But then he started getting very nasty, you know, I guess he figured that I'm just a dumb Jamaican boy. So then finally I get tired of playing around, I said to the man, I say, "Look. "Mister, you better be afraid. "Because Jomo, he bad. Jomo shoot your babies." You said, "Jomo shoot your babies"? (LAUGHING) I tell the man! I say, "Mister, I'm angry! And I got to take this car to me family." What's the matter, you no Jomo's family? Hey, Jomo. You're our family. You're the only family we've got. And we love you, man. We love you. Jomo, where did you put the old truck? I hide it, man. I hide it good. Nobody find the old truck. Okay? Get in! We go for a ride. MAN: I'd have never seen it if it hadn't been for that wheel sticking out. BOGARDIE: Good thing you came out here. -It's always good hunting up here after the rain. -BOGARDIE: Mm-hm. MAN: You know, those rabbits can't run so fast in that mud. When's the last time you was out here? Oh, it must've been about a week ago, and it wasn't down there then. In fact, I shot the biggest rabbit you ever saw right in that same spot. All right, let's go! There's a narrow meeting place in the center of town. And watch yourself, because it's always crowded with a lot of people. Plus, we don't want to be hurting nobody when we get outta there. Yeah. Don't worry, homeboy. I don't care how little it is, or even if it's in the back of a store, I mean, if there is a bank to be found in that town, I will find it, huh? It's small, and it's well-guarded. And it's got a lot of money in it. You know, when I first started stealing, it's because I was hungry and had to. And then I think... I think I begin to like it. Just a little. But what really troubles me, is that now I think I might miss this way of life. I won't miss it, Jomo. I really won't miss it. Let me show you something, man. This is your latest post on you and sister Thomasine. You see, "$4,000 reward, "dead or alive, Thomasine and Bushrod." That's you. "Known to have many friends among the Indians, "Mexicans, poor whites "and other colored people. "Wanted for murder, bank robbing, "and other acts "against the peace and the dignity of the United States." Like I said, Jomo, I won't miss it, man. I better giddy up and go now. (HORSE NEIGHS) (JOMO RIDING AWAY) This place has been good to us. Hmm. Wonder what history's gonna say about us. I guess it just depends on who writes it. I'm ready to... I'm ready to tell you what I was doing before I met you. I already told you, it doesn't matter. I want to tell you anyway. I was a bounty hunter. And? That's it! I was a bounty hunter. That's what you were ashamed to tell me? I also, um... I also made up the story about the guy coming in on the stage. Because I didn't want you to think I was easy to get. I been meaning to tell you something too. Don't tell me it's bad. My sister, she say to me, she say, "Brother Jomo," she say... She always call me "Brother," you know, she say, "Brother Jomo, you just make sure that the fine young tender is not the sheriff's daughter." I say, "With the magic I use? "With the magic I use, I might come back with the banker's daughter!" Anybody out there the banker's daughter? Huh? You're the banker's daughter, lady with the pretty red shawl? No? (LAUGHS) Anybody know where the bank is? Little cousin, come here, help me out. You people don't wanna help me, huh? You know, uh... You know the banker's daughter personally? Well, then, do you know where the bank is, personally? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Well! You want to try on me magic hat, huh? Bring you luck. But just try it on for a minute, 'cause you gotta give it back you know! BOGARDIE: How you doing, chicken thief? (JOMO LAUGHS NERVOUSLY) Bogardie! Man, you must be going soft in the mind in your old age, huh? Oh, you forget what Jomo do to you last time? Oh, no. No, I didn't forget. Well, then, that's too bad. This time, you're gonna have to die. You know, 'cause Jomo is bad. Jomo shoot your babies, hmm? Pick him up. (INDISTINCT) Cut me down! I'm gonna ask you one more time. You tell me where they are and I'll let you go. Bogardie, Bogardie, Bogardie, Bogardie! Bogardie! What the hell is the matter with you? I don't know. I don't know, I don't know! (JOMO YELLS) (SCREAMING) Don't make no difference. They'll probably come looking for him anyway. Goodbye, chicken thief. Maybe, um... Maybe he just went someplace and got drunk. You know better than that, Thomasine. I wonder what we'd be doing if Jomo had never come into our lives. Doesn't make any difference. He came. And he's family. And he might be in trouble. So we gotta go get him. (COCKS RIFLE) Me and the baby... (SIGHS) ...love you very much. I love you too. Don't you think we should let the townspeople know what's going on? Just in case they do come. Well, we can't take that chance. You see, people all over the country love Thomasine and Bushrod. Matter of fact, somebody right here in this town wrote a song about them. But people might get hurt. It can't be helped. Now we gotta show them that you can't break the laws and get away with it, don't we? Now you've gotta get ahold of yourself. Let's go over here now. What do you think? I think we ought to name the baby after Jomo. Now. You gonna help your woman get up, or what? Come on, Bushrod! (YELLING) Hit him! Hit him! (ECHOING) Hit him!
