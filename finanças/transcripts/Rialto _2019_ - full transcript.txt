So I'm not gonna go on for too much longer. 'Cause I know how good you are with very boring speeches. However, the lovely Grietje is gonna take us through the next stage of everything. So, please welcome Grietje. Thank you, Paula. Thanks for your kind words of introduction and for making us feel so welcome here this afternoon. It is a great honor, and I mean that sincerely, to be in Dublin today meeting the team. This visit I see primarily as an opportunity for people to get to know one another. I will begin, however, by saying the following. We don't see this as a simple acquisition, but rather as an opportunity to merge two strong and separate entities and, by sharing best practices in both, to make something new, something stronger. So that's us all fucked, eh? You skiving? Going to the bank. It's well for some! Who was him earlier on by the way? A friend of Shane's. He's hanging around with scrotes? I'll have a word. Leave things alone, will ya? Fucking mind your own business! Sort yourself out. What? What I said, all right? Enough just! Arthur Considine. Remember him? No. - You do. - I don't. He had his wife, went psychiatric. Mam! Lovely handwriting. See? I'm not fuckin' reading them, I told you. I haven't got all night. I know that. Can we start, so, please? Do you want something to eat first? Mam. I'll put some fish fingers in a sandwich for you. All right. You're always a pleasure to feed. I'm watching that. For fuck's sake! Will we need to do a spread for Sunday, for people? It's not a fuckin' wedding, Mam. It's a month's mind. His good blazer. You could wear that. I don't wear blazers. Do you not? You'd swim in it, anyway. Can't see why hasn't Caroline done any of this. She's busy. And I'm not? I don't know. You're here. Mam, stop, please. We can wait this if you want. We can do it another night. No. I'm sick looking at them. Hanging there. And his shoes. Where's Mam? Inside, where do you think? What? You couldn't help with any of this? I do help. How? Helping isn't all heavy lifting, Colm. No? I'll stay with her a bit, see her settled. How's Claire? How would I know? Fine. Be a pig, so! 'Sake! - You're late. - Get in. Do you have my money? Just get into the fuckin' car please. I can't stop here! Were you waiting long? Long enough. I was in Rialto at my mam's place. I have your money here. Can we sit a minute first? Why? No why, I just, I've had a bit of a day, that's all. Please, I'm paying. That where you're from? Rialto? Yeah, you know it? No. A bit, sort of. I know Crumlin. Yeah. Can I ask you something? What? To do something. Depends. You don't have to. I'd like to watch. Watch what? You jerk off. Could I? I'll pay more. How much more? 240, total. I have it here. You don't have to. I know that. You could lie back the seat, if you want. I won't touch you, I promise. Now? Please. Where do you want me to cum? On your belly, please. I need to wipe myself. You don't hate me, no? No. What do you think, then? Nothing. You put the frighteners on other lads? No. Why me, then? I need the money. I see. I have this girlfriend. We have a baby, me and her. Her family hates me, her brothers say I stole money. I never done. I wouldn't. Them it was I was fighting with. I came to you then. Do people know you do this? Does anyone? Not many. Your girlfriend? No. Our secret. We'll leave each other alone now. We're evens, anyway. I'll drop us back, will I? Please. You blanking me? I didn't forget. No? No, I was in Gran's, is all. You know the way she is. Yak-yak-yak! Lianne waited with me for a bit anyways. Should have rang. I couldn't. It's your fault. I can't understand that fuckin' phone! I promised I'd pick you up, didn't I? Just never said what day. Fuck off, you! You fuck off! Could have gone for a drink. I'm working tomorrow. Oh yeah. You should ask Shane one of these days. You think? I do, yeah. Just to see the look of shock on his face. They all in bed? You got a game tomorrow? Shane? Yes. I might come down. You will, I'd say. What time is it on? What time? Half fucking three! All right, relax. You're working, aren't you? Yeah. So? Are we not allowed to talk? Not when you're fucking blocked, no. Hiya. Thanks for coming. See you next week. - Thanks very much. - Brilliant. - Hi, Paula. - Come on in. Warm in here, is it? A bit. I might just open the window. You don't mind? Summer outside, anyway. We can breathe. I called you in. You did. Yeah. This isn't easy, Colm. No. How long have you been with us? Dunno, can't remember. Why? At a guess? Since I was 16, I suppose. A lifetime, you could say. You could. I have an offer to put to you. Generous too. I made sure of that. An offer of what? Redundancy. It's all laid out there, the detail. A cash sum of couse for all your years and a timeline. I could go through- - Is it voluntary? Just hear me out first. I don't fucking want to! All right. At least read through it, regardless. Take it away with you, talk to Claire. And if I don't agree, if I want to stay on? The money's good. I don't care about the money, I'm 46! I know that. I'm not ready yet. This isn't a judgment on you. What is it, then? Bad luck. I dunno. Circumstance. I've never been nothing else. I'm sorry. We don't need money, me and Claire. What do you mean? I mean we never remortgaged or nothing. We don't think that, so our house is paid for and the kids is paid for, nearly. So I could take a drop in wages if that's it. That's not it. Fucking what, then? We're clearing out certain grades, that's all. They're changin the way they work. There's no stopping that. I have my years here. I know that, I respect that. I'm sorry, Colm. Well, then? Look over what's been offered. Come back in after, we can talk. Tell me! The plain truth of it? Yeah! Your job is gone. In effect. Things will be done different now. That's all. There's no job for you here. Hey. Is Claire thereabouts? No, she's just gone on lunch. Oh. You don't know where to? Did she say? No, she didn't. Valerie was with her, though. Right. They'll be talking, so. We could call her. No, that's fine. I'll catch her at home. I'm only here on the off-chance anyway. She'll have her phone, anyway. Yeah. She'll be back at two, anyways. Exactly. Will I tell her you was here? What? Will I tell her you were here? No, that's fine. Thanks. Okay. Bye. Keep going, get in there! Lads, leave it! Lads, calm down! Leave it! Relax, lads! Let's tune in, get the next ball. Hello. It's me. There's towels on the bed. Room 12. Thanks. The end of the corridor, on the right. Is she all right? The girl at reception. She won't call anyone, will she? No, she's grand. Yeah, she's used to it maybe. People. Yeah. You warm enough? You all right? Yeah, I'm all right. Yeah? Good. Who done that to your hair? My mate. Your mate? Well, she's in a salon. God fucking help us! Though all she ever does in there is sweep up or sit on her hole. I can't hardly see you with the lamp not on. Do you want it on? Do you want it on? I don't give a fuck. You can leave it off or just- There. What? Your hair's kind of fucked. I know. I could kill her. It's not that bad. You just look a bit like a knacker. Sorry, sorry. I was just trying to be funny. You're all right. I'll have to take this, sorry. I haven't got all day. Yeah, all right. Claire? No, I just thought we'd have lunch. Is everything all right? Yeah, I'm fine. Where are you? At work, why? I called there. They said you was gone. I'm not there now, I wasn't feeling well. I went home. You're at home? No, not yet. Well, where are you? In fucking town someplace! Is there a problem? No. Well, what, then? Nothing. I was worried. That's all. Linda said you seemed upset. I can't talk, okay? Why? I just can't talk. Later. But you're all right? Yeah. I was worried, that's all. Head home, so. Right, yeah. Rest. Okay, bye. You want to go? No. No, I don't think so. Surprised I called you, that's all. I didn't think I'd want to see you again. Nearly deleted you, but I couldn't. This fucking phone! I'm useless, I told you that. Glad, anyways, to be here, to see you. Take off your top, please. If that's all right, if you want to. I've cans in the bag. Cheap Polish shite, but I didn't know what you drank and they were on offer. Are you having one? Yeah, I'll join you, cheers. Thanks. Not bad. No. Well, it's shite, but it's nice. It's okay, yeah? Yeah. You all right? Yeah. Yeah, thanks. I think so, yeah. I lost my job there. Yeah? Yeah, I think so, anyways. I might fight for it, I dunno. It was a bit of a shock, I wasn't expecting that. It's all I've ever been, really. I love them docks, looking out on the world there. Your baby a boy or a what? A girl. Girl? What's her name? Why? You don't got to tell me. Chloe. You're young for a baby. It was an accident. Yeah, I know. And you love her? Of course. Do anything for her, I would. I do this. 13 weeks. I gave up smoking when she was born. Good man. She's lovely, Chloe is. I hardly get to see her now. My girlfriend never wants me there. And then she blames me for not being around. She's a cunt sometimes, Lorraine. She hates me nearly. But she had a baby for you. That's why, maybe. What age is she? Same as me. Younger. 19, 18. When did you start doing this? Why? What? Selling. Does it matter? I think so. I'd like to know. Ages back. And? At school I'd go mitchin', yeah? People didn't give a fuck. Me and a few mates down Ballybough or Fairview Park. This one time, the lads was gone. I was there on my own. We'd been drinking. This bloke stops, this old fella, and sits down. Starts talking. Saying all weird shit about women and that. It was funny. He had a car, that's all. So I went with him. He gave me money after. I was just laughing me hole off, you know. It was easy, I was 14. He shouldn't have done that. He was all right. Most lads are, you know? Only some are dirty bastards. I can spot them now. I'm not one of them. I know you're not. What am I, then? I'll have to go soon. Yeah, of course. Okay, can we start? All right. What do you want? Take off your clothes, please. Just leave on your jocks. I don't want a show, just to look at you. You're beautiful. I want you to fuck me. Yeah? Hard. Turn over, it's easier. Has Paula had you in yet? No. No? I thought you talked. Well, I survived, sure. I'm an asset. That's what she told me anyway. The fucking ghoul! Is there something eating you? What? The face on you. Is everything ara with you and Claire, is that it? No. Are you still in the saddle? Powers, please, Stephen. Listen, take some advice. Don't fuck things up. Or you'll end up like me, paying through the nose. I seen you seen Kathleen, Colm. Watching her there, yeah? Like father, like son. Be careful. Got you a drink. Can I sit? Suit yourself. How's you? Why? No why, I'm just asking. I see. We have his month's mind tomorrow. There's a mass, it's the usual 12 o'clock thing. But they'll read his name out at the end. Why are you telling me this for? I dunno, you might come. And have people laughing, is it? No. I won't fucking bother, thanks all the same. And it's nothing to do with you, what I do, when. And how dare you? The him I knew- - Here. I'm not supposed to serve cans at this hour. I know, Stephen, you're very good. Lads, come on, finish up! Three more pints. We're closed now! Finish up, come on. Bye. See you later, cheerio. A couple more pints, Mac. You can't keep drinking. Not like this. Like before. Colm! I know. It frightens me. We could talk to someone. Who? I don't know, a professional, a counselor. I can't. Why not? I'll be fine after tomorrow, all right? We'll finish tomorrow first, then I'll right myself, I promise. Thank you, thank you. Who was the young fella? Noel mentioned him. Said he called on you. Yeah. Is he something to do with Shane? No. That's what Noel said. Who was he? No one. Please. He was a lad belonging to one of the lads, that's all. He wanted me to show him the yard. I should try and sleep, I can't sleep. Lie down here. I can't. Why? It's more than that. I'll go to the sitting room, I'll only disturb you here. You don't. Colm. I'm here. Okay. If we, if we told people what was really in our heads, if we admitted it to ourselves even, what would happen, do you think? What? I dunno. We'd all go mad, I reckon. What? I'm sorry. There. Thanks. Will I cook tonight? Yeah, I don't mind. A pork steak, I might. Is Shane awake? Claire. Claire! We might go out tonight maybe. Who? You and me. After everything, if you want. Where to? I don't mind. We could talk because, you know, we haven't in ages. I'd like that. Okay. Shane? Shane? You hiding? You look rough. Yeah, half-poisoned. I've no sympathy. Why do they leave her like that? They're hardly ever there. Fuckin' thing'll strangle itself. I know. Any plans the weekend? No. Me and Lianne is going out this evening. Might stay at hers tonight. She's nice, Lianne? She is. You're good pals? We are. Get my coat, I better. Okay. Did he say my name? You ready? Yeah. Tell her I'll fuckin' brain him if she comes near me. See my phone? The size of her! She's healthy, she is. Shane! I'm leaving now, if you want to come with me, we'll pick up Gran. I'll wait for mom, okay? I think you should give her a go. She was all delighted. Nah, she's a horse, that one! Oh, my God! Wear a tie please. - She is! - Shane! I'm not fucking deaf! Is that your dad? My bag. My keys are in there. I think they are. Are they? I dunno, Mam. My head. It's here. They're here. Do I look all right? I don't know any more. You look grand. We'll have lunch somewhere after if you want. Yeah? Yeah. Soup and sandwich job, okay? You ready? Mam? I know. You see herself? Kathleen. Yeah, she's to be pitied. Fuck her! I'm taking Mam inside. All right. Will we go in? Yeah, in a second. You're going now? I'll be in in a second. All right. And our brother Sosthenes. To the Church of God which is at Corinth, to those sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints together with all those who in every place call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Both their Lord and ours. Praise to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. I give thanks to God. Always to you because of the grace of God which was given you in Christ Jesus, that in every way you were enriched in him with all speech and all knowledge. Even as a testimony to Christ was confirmed among you. Jameson, please. Do you want a drink? We'll go after this one. Another orange? Yeah? All right. Another orange, please. You all right? That's him done. You bringing Mam home? Yeah. She can come to us tomorrow. You look wrecked, by the way. Thanks. You done your best by him, Colm. Biggest disappointment in life I was. That's all in your head. Is it? Let me get this one. With what? I have money. Claire, has he lifted your purse? Okay, you can buy your own! See what you're raising, Colm! The mouth on that one. He's all his mam's fault. I will have something. Too late now. Have a cocktail, Caroline. Jesus, it went on for ever! - And that- - Gospel? I'd never heard- - You heard what I said. What did you say? I'm going to meet a friend after, I'm not drinking. She's got a little friend! Yeah, I'm going to meet a friend for a coffee. Shane. - Just a friend! - Leave her be. Look at the smile, she's going red! Shane, Shane! I'm only messing with her. Just leave her be. You all right, Mam? All right? Take care, Miriam. I'll stay for a bit. I'll come home after. We still going out later? Yeah. All right, Mam? I thought people from the Dockers might've made it. Who? His pals or anyone. To the church. They came to the funeral, didn't they? You don't have to stay. It's okay. I keep expecting to hear his voice. The way he filled this house. He made nothing easy on you, I know that. I'm sorry. On none of us. I'm settled now. I'll watch the telly. Go. Fine. Why the fuck are you here? What? You can't just arrive! I know that. Get in here! Sit. This where you stay? Why? It's rough enough, is it? It's better than nothing. Yeah, I suppose. You wearing a suit? Yeah, I was at mass. Couldn't make myself go home, found myself here. Why? I dunno. There's no lies between us, I think. No? Not really. This last month, I dunno, it's been hard. Why? I lost my dad, see. He died. I'm sorry. You needn't be, he was only a cunt. I don't miss him. I think about him but I don't miss him. And he left me like this, anyways. Sort of complicated. What did he die of? His heart. Just fell down dead in front of me. I couldn't bring him back, I tried. Fucking useless I was. Goes around my head, that does. I think about it. Do you want tea? Yeah, please. So I haven't been myself since, you know? My wife doesn't know what's going on. She thinks I need help. Counseling or something. I think she thinks I'm losing my mind. Which is a worry. Is your dad alive? Yeah. Does he help you? What? Does he help you? Why? He should. He lives in Cherry Orchard. That's no excuse. He has another family now. Do you never see him? A nosey cunt, you! I know, yeah. In town sometimes, I see him. We go drinking. He's a funny fucker. Always sniffing around after women. He left when me and my sister were small. He left us with my mother. She's a mad fucking, I don't think he should have done that. That's all. But he's a good laugh, he is. Okay. You can drink that and go. Yeah. We all hate our dads, do we? I dunno. Supposed to, I think. It's natural. All straight lines, my dad was. He terrorized everyone in our house and he fuckin' ruined people. Only I'm not angry at him. No? Nah. I mean, I never loved the cunt, that's for sure, when I think about him. All he was at the end was an accumulation of fucking lies really. Isn't that hard? I dunno. It's awful. I hate it and it makes me afraid. I don't want to be like him. I don't want to be gone and have people putting me together different after. I want to be straight out, I want a life, I want to be a good person. Wait. Oh, dearie me! Daddy's here. Don't worry, Daddy's here. Is that Chloe? Yeah. I thought you never seen her. I don't. My girlfriend left her for a few hours. Feeling guilty, I think. That's it, that's it. I shouldn't have come, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'll go. That's it, that's it. She's lovely. It's Killian he's talking about. Fucking weirdo! What? He's an emo kid. Shane hates him. He'll end up doing a mass murder. I'm telling you. Some outrage! Shane! Down the corridor of the school. Bam-bam-bam! Stop that! What? Be nice. I am fuckin' nice! I'll change out of my suit. Ready myself, all right? I'm set. Just need to put on my face. Where you headed? Dunno, I don't mind. The Dockers, maybe? And her all dressed up? I don't mind, Dockers is grand. Should be quiet tonight anyway. You could play darts. Fuck's sake! I'm waiting on Valerie. I'll stay there a few days, give you time. Time for what? I dunno. You tell me. I can't sit here and watch this. Waiting. Claire. Like a fucking fool you treat me! You push me away! I want to help! I would, if you'd let me! Talk to me! This frightens me. I'm sorry. Where did you go even, what did you do? I was demented! Look at me! You can't. You don't any more. I'm sick. Jesus Christ! Worried, she was. Went out driving around, looking for you. Why? Afraid you might have done something. Done something like what? I don't fucking know! Harmed yourself. No. No. No. - No? - No. My hands, they're shaking. I can't stop them. Show me. You're all clammy. Am I? Yeah. I went for a walk was all. I got lost in myself. Where to? Can't remember. Dollymount, I think. I'm sorry. Okay? I'm sorry. Is Kerry gone? Shane. Shane, I'm talking. Shane. I don't give a fuck what you say. What? A selfish cunt is who you are. Yeah, I know that. Shane, I'm sorry. Shane, can we talk, please? Why? I don't mean to be upsetting people. I'm sorry. So why are you a cunt always? I've been lost, all right? - Shane. - Fuck's sake! Shane, listen! Fucking listen! You don't even know me! But you judge me! You don't even know me. Isn't that awful? Don't you think? Jesus Christ! - Shane. - Fuck you! All right, fine, I'll tell you this. I'll tell you this, then you can hate me good and proper. Okay? What? I know this lad, this young fella, same age as yourself, he's fuckin' 18 or 19. And? And I pay him. I pay him. We talk and then he fucks me. He fucks me in my car. Or in a B&B one time. He fucks me. And I love him. I do, I love him more than I fuckin' love you. I do. And that's the truth. - Fucking- - Shane! Fuck off, you! Are you okay? Yeah. It's nothing. I was just thinking. About what? Nothing. No? About us, I was thinking, here like this. That first time I seen you, the first time we met, in them toilets, remember? Do you remember? I was afraid of you. Yeah? My fucking heart was thumping. Different now, though, is it? Pals, are we? My son it was who slapped me. - Yeah. - Why? 'Cause I'm a fucking asshole, probably. So what happened? Nothing, we had words. And worse after. It's fine. It will be, I think. I hope so, anyways. I'm giving you all this again. You're grand. My fucking mouth! When I woke this morning, dying sick, my son was there. I don't know why but I thought I might climb out of myself if I didn't. Didn't what? Tell him. Tell him what? About this. What we did, what we do. Our fucking and that. I wanted him to know me. To hate me, if he had to. To finish things. I told him I love you. Told him I love you more than I love him. Jesus Christ! I know. I meant I care for you, I told you. You shouldn't have done that. Sorry. I love my girlfriend. My daughter. I try to, anyway. Yeah. This is just this, you know? It isn't real. It's money. All right? Yeah. I've pulled the whole thing around my ears, have I? We can go, if you want. I'll pay you still, I don't want sex. No, you're all right.
