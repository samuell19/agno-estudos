I'm wearing the new Nike high-tops that my mom got me. It's those red and black Jordans? The main ones? The banned ones. I'm a king at school. I'm walking through the hallway and people are giving me high-fives and shouting my name because of how awesome these shoes are. Even a teacher tried to kiss me. It was crazy. SRINI: This all sounds fake, but I don't care. Lie to me. MIGUEL: So it's PE. Kids all around me. I'm feeling great. I hear a rumor that I might get voted Homecoming King. It's all breaking my way. Shoes look remarkable. That's when Kevin Troy walks up. - Hey, Miguel. MIGUEL: I say... What's up, Kev? His name's Kevin, but I call him Kev, even though I've never talked to him before, because that's just how good I was feeling. Kevin's looking down at my feet like he's real curious about my shoes. And I'm like... Nice, right? Got 'em for my birthday. I can ask my mom where she got them from if you wanted a pair. And that's when it all fell apart. - Hey, yo, come check out these fake ass Jordans. - Because here's the part I didn't tell anyone. The shoes were fake. My mom got 'em from the flea market. The little Jordan on there wasn't even dunking it, he was laying it up. The swoosh was actually a check mark. The shoes don't even say "Air Jordan" on them. I swear to God, they said "Air Morgan." [students laughing] - Look at them. TEEN: Oh, my God, your mom doesn't love you! KEVIN: You know what a swish looks like? A swish goes swoosh. [bell dings] - Honestly, I don't know why I didn't pick him in the first place. He should have been my first pick. - Know what? Let's scout this thing. Kevin is a little older than you. - Mm-hmm. - Kevin knows more than you. - Mm-hmm. - He's slightly a better fighter than you. - Mm-hmm. - So he's... - Morpheus in The Matrix. - Yeah, that feels a little... Is that racist? 'Cause they're both Black? - Maybe a little. - One, he knows more than me. CASS: Mm-hmm. - Two, he's a better fighter than me. So you know what that makes me? Neo. - Kevin probably loves The Matrix. - Is that bad? - Everybody loves The Matrix. - I'm on Miguel's side, okay? Everything Kevin Troy does is stupid! Mm! CASS: Look, you know what to do. Just close your eyes and visualize it. - Mm-hmm. CASS: Jack yourself in, Neo. ♪ Ethereal music playing ♪ - This is a sparring program, similar to the program reality of The Matrix.

'Cause I always see him after school. - Who is that? What... What did he do to you? - No, you know Blake. He's the one whose sister... - Oh, that's right. Wait. - First of all, that was like over a month ago. And second of all, she's fine. And third of all, he's a total dick. All he does is make fun of people.

[bell dings] - I thought it had to be someone who did something specifically to you. - I'm ensuring egalitarianism, like a superhero. - But you're more like Peter Parker before he becomes Spider-Man energy. - Yeah, the problem is you're still afraid of getting hit. That's why you flinched with Kevin when he reached out. You can't flinch. - That makes sense, though. You have never been hit in the face before, and not knowing what that feels like is way worse than knowing what it feels like because it's a natural fear, but it's not as bad as you think. MIGUEL: Hmm. - So just like we had to un-nice you, now we gotta un-flinch you. - And how's that? - Well... Right? - God. - Right. Ha. Let's try again. MIGUEL: I'm chill. - Let's try it again.

My crush. - I'm sorry? - What? - What? - Clearly I like... - Back up. - I'm into you, Cass. It's so... - That was not clearly... - What? You haven't seen the signs? - Hey, look who it is.

Your first fight? - Bro, it fucking sucked. [both laughing] - Yeah. - Horrible. - I saw you got a clean one in there though. - Mm-hmm. - Saved me. - Listen, I, uh... What I said to you was...
