- How are you? - Everything good. - Come in. Take a seat. - Do you want a coffee? - Er ... No, thanks. You followed what happened with the book by Carsten Villar? - I read it in the newspapers. Has been attacked very hard. - Yes. "LA MARUDE" - Is this the book with the lawyers' notes? - Yes. It's awesome. - He is brave, he exposes himself to everything and everyone. - Yeah. Or he is masochist. You can't write a novel about politics using transparent pseudonyms, ... .. accusing anyone of the worst depravity and thinking of "getting away with it". I, on the other hand, would believe the opposite, that many have an interest in making it go unnoticed. Not journalists and bloggers. - It's news that on Twitter becomes irrepressible. - I thought you couldn't read the books anymore. True, there are fewer readers and more books, but there is more tension. I have the impression that writing make people hysterical. - What do you mean by that? - That makes them wary, scares them. Less read and the more they see the writing with suspicion. I think we live in civilization of writing, look at the Internet. We write more, more often and, on the contrary of what is said, with some attention. - Well, it's still a minority. - It will be a minority but it is still a lot of people. More people who write more and better. - Four lines on Twitter don't ... - Why not? Why? It's like under the Ancien Régime. People make jokes. I find it very French. There is nothing new. - There's only more people making jokes and that shares more. - Even very bad jokes! Yes, and in bad taste:they have always been there. (VIBRATION OF A CELL) - All this favors narcissism. - Eh, yes. The era is narcissistic. What can you do? It ruins the relationship with art and with artists. - You are no less narcissistic than others:all we are. - Wait, I don't understand what you mean. I reject this materialistic society. His obsession with money, the cult of the body and clothes. You're trivializing. Asked about the your radicality, it is no less narcissistic. You know how I live. If my wife not working, I would ask for the subsidy. - Do I have the right to judge the world? - Of course you have the right. I'm just saying that this radicalism he is equally narcissistic. It is by far the most coveted commodity. Sorry, you don't want to deprive us of this too. Do what you want, think what you want and I'll do it. - I don't recognize you, you know? - Let's go to eat? (BUZZ) - Good morning, Pamela. - Good morning. - What a crush. - (Pamela) We don't complain. - Will it be time? - It's Monday, the Thai is closed. - Ah here. - Do we sit down there? - Please make yourselves comfortable. - Thank you. That's our table. - Did you receive the statement? - Yup. "Foundation" is fine. He still sells, in short. Yes, it's 10 years, it's stable. Even the pocket version. No, because the others are a bit stagnant. Yes, the others stagnate at the bottom. - "The goodbyes ..." - "... in a low voice." - "The goodbyes in a low voice", yes. It has not exactly depopulated. - We have not contributed to deforestation. - No. It's a "worst-seller", as they say. Yes, it happens. - I met your ex-wife. What's your name? - Solange. Solange, yes. - Because in "Gli adii" it's not called that. - Yes, Véronique. Véronique Pastoureau. It's true. - He told me he was sick. - Yes, it seems serious enough. - Do you see yourself? - No. No, she left me, so ... - I think he suffers. - I do not know. Probably yes. It was very painful for me, so I don't feel like talking about it again. - Frankly it made me very sorry, since they bind us with memories. - Yup. The Barcelona Book Fair, when he was completely drunk. - Excuse me, Alain, I don't have much want to talk about it. - Oh, sure, I understand. - Is Valérie okay? - Oh, yes, very good. Well... - He is always a parliamentary assistant. - About David? Yes, it is always away. Tell her I really appreciate it David's positions are brave. - Especially those on culture in Brussels. - Sure, I'll tell you. And she will surely tell him. And it will make him happy, I guess. Yes. - Here you are. - Thanks. - As a dish of the day there is the veal stew. - Yup. So, I take the usual:steak in blood, green and half natural salad. - Thank you. - (Pamela) And for her? - Don't you take the appetizer? - No. - But take it, if you want. - Agree. I, instead, take ... paté, please, ... ..and then ... turbot with aioli sauce. - (Pamela) The turbot. - Here. - Well. - Do you want some wine? - For me no. - Thank you. (Pamela) Thank you, gentlemen. Then... - You know, Valérie is a bit her ... Oriane. Oh yeah. - Yup. - And Xenia is Stephanie Volkowski. Channel 8 presenter, do you know? - Yup. - I'm talking about the manuscript. - Yes. - Maybe you read it. - Yes, yes. Yes, I read it, sure. I wanted to talk to you about it. - Yup. - We're here for that, to talk about it. - Yup. I liked it. It seems very in line with what you've written in recent years. Well, yes, I feel like I have embarked on an almost necessary path. And that scene where they meet by chance in the DIY department ... - Yes, it really happened to me. - I imagined. It's very exciting. And then the fact that you tell it in fragments ... We no longer know if it is she who speaks or if that's what you're afraid of telling you. Or rather, what i should have said ... ... if it had been more lucid, or ... No, the right word to say is not "lucid" ... - More honest? - No. More... - If she had been more cruel. - Oh yes. It's very hard ... but it's true. - There was no such scene in another novel of yours? - Ah, yes, in ... - In "Police Report". - Quite right. Is it recent? - 8 years ago. - Ah, no, then it's not recent. I talked about it the other day with Constance, the new press officer. She really likes "Police Report". It's one of his favorite books. Have you seen? I remember that you were not convinced at the time. - Yes ... It does age well instead. - Mm, fine. And so Constance asked me why I had not continued on that strand. Well, you know, why do it again? Don't do it again, but ... prolong it. You wanted me to continue to write something about that genre? - No, no, no ... - Do you have doubts? - No. Questions? Questions ... Yes, in short, of the questions I ask myself about myself. - They don't affect your text. - But it is my text that it is. No, it is your text that stimulates reflection, but it is a reflection that goes beyond your text. What do you mean? I'm just wondering if ... .. compared to our age, we're not both cut off ... ..from what happens or that could happen. But who writes books and who publishes them it is out of phase with its own era. - Gentlemen, here's the paté. - Ah, yes, for me. - For him. - Well. Enjoy your meal. - Thank you. - So ... thanks for lunch. - Yes, sorry, nothing. - If you want to take a look at some books ... - I've already looked at it. There's not much for me. - Well. I go. - See you soon. - Yes, see you soon. - Hello. - Eh ... But ... - Yup? - For the manuscript then ... - Thing? - Well, do you have a date? - I do not understand. For publication. You'll publish it, won't you? No, I won't publish it. I thought you understood. (VOICES INDISTINTO) Here I am. They all arrived. - Sorry I'm late. - You are never on time. - I was in a meeting with Laure. - It's warm. Laure? Laure d'Angerville, I told you about her. Work on the development of digital editions. Ah, yes, the brilliant one, who studied business and has a sexual predator look. I understood. That's right. Today it is simple. I have more readers on my blog than in the bookstore. You can't complain, your book started well. - Come on, be honest! I've seen batteries and batteries at the Carrefour! - (Man) It's a success. We will make an audiobook. They go very well. - I thought I'd ask Catherine Deneuve. - I'm in. - He will never accept. - What do you know? It seems to be very kind. - I have 5,000 visits a day on my blog. - A day ?! - Yup! - I do not believe it! - What are you talking about on the blog? - But ... I don't know ... about current events. - Non-literary current affairs. - No, of that that interests me and interests people. The fact is that they read me. And they read me more easily online than on paper. - Sure, it's free. - People are obsessed with free stuff. -In a crisis period it is normal. I mean ... They want to that art is free, not computer science. - What do you mean? - No one gets problems to spend 1500 euros for a computer. In addition to the cost of the Internet subscription. Whether there is a crisis or not. While spending to buy music, or books, or even the newspaper creates a huge problem. - Yes, but the books are much less pirated. Not there is comparison. - Because young people read less. The real pirates are Internet providers. They sell content that is not theirs. The fact is that art has lost its meaning and integrity, so it must be free. - Many good people think so. - And many decent people think otherwise. It is easy to hide behind the ideas of art modern to then download "Fast and Furious". - You're simplifying. - Fuck you! We have dinner? - Gladly. - I'm just saying that not all sectors ... - Who's helping me out? - Arrival. Please, take the sweets. You can put them there. .. Like information, it must be free because it is considered false and manipulative. If we paid, we would respect it. It is distorted by the power of lobbies, by conformism of journalists. He lost credibility. While the voices, the most absurd, confirmed by unverifiable experts, "if they drink them" immediately. No! I've heard this a thousand times. Come on, look, it wasn't the Internet to invent the voices. And modern states they are not the first to manipulate them. Let's learn to think to avoid this drift! Maybe that's what books are for. - Only we learn less and less. - Oh yes? - Yes, it looks like an evolving virus. The writing will be dematerialized. It is inevitable. - But, sorry ... You read the manuscripts on the tablet now. - Not everybody. - I don't read on the tablet. - Because it is not of your age. It does not belong to your education. No offense! Look at the new generations that are grown up with the computer. It's all different. - Objectively, however, they read less. - False. Take the proliferation of blogs! - Just prove that there are more people than them write. - And they have time to waste. - Yup. I disagree, you write to me more than before. The Internet has freed the word. What kind of word do you mean? A kind of uncontainable flow? Thank you very much! - I wasn't referring to your blog. - Of course! - Which by the way I don't read. Instead I read your books. - Ah. - Ah. Then you are definitely in the minority. It is because my blog is visited that one Some users buy my books. From there its relative success of which Alain spoke. - Yes, but your books are more read on the Kindle. - It's true. Figures in hand, the strongest readers are the elderly. And more or less, more retirees. And among pensioners, plus women. They all went to the e-reader. - It is more practical, easy, light, manageable. - He has big letters. If you go on a trip, in the Kindle you can put all your library there. I don't care about traveling with it all my library? I take a book. It will be lighter than a Kindle, right? - And it doesn't have to be recharged. - Exactly. You are prejudiced, but it is reality. In the future we will read fewer books and do it on e-readers. - Then I insist! - But no! - Selena, enough with vodka! I'm wondering:why not pass immediately all in digital? Economically it doesn't make sense. The books sell. Less than before, but they sell. - The chain works. - Yes, but it will soon change. If we eliminate intermediaries, distributors, booksellers, printers, only publishers and authors remain. - So the publishing house becomes a website. - Yes, you can call it site. A site that does the same work on manuscripts, the same procedure, with the same needs. - It's very depressing. - It is for you, not for those who have already switched to electronic books. Still the e-books, the e-books ?! All right. - Do you find it so funny? - But yes! - It does not change nothing, get rid of manufacturing. - The agreements with the authors remain the same. - For example, My blog would be on your site. Sure. They will do exactly the same things you do with books. Perhaps even better, because we will focus on it on the essential, without packaging, logistics. - Someone will be fired. - No, it will be done less than some but they will hire others. There will be no less work. Thus, literary prizes you will vote distance:click. - Awarding by e-mail. - Why not with Amazon Prime! Yes, and then, to meet readers video conferences will be held. - We do this already. - Everything is thought why people don't come out of the house anymore. - It's a bit gloomy, isn't it? - It's another era, we're at a turning point. Read Adorno on the iPad or in its original edition on parchment has no effect on the contents. I really doubt they are there original editions of Adorno on parchment. - You didn't read it much. - No, it was just to say. Yes we can abandoning books serenely. I believe there are other glasses there. Yes ... They are scattered around a bit. I had lunch with Leonard. - It was painful. - Ah, it's always painful! This time in particular. We talked about his manuscript. - What are you talking about? - Ah, always the same thing. His sentimental stories. Rather repetitive, and also quite squalid. - Recent stories? - Recent, yes. - Didn't you like it? - I have many reservations. - Yet I like what he writes. - It is only the continuation of the previous one. - The previous one is not bad. - I struggled. "If you scratch cynicism", there is a kind of human being, below. I refused it. I need your advice. It is unusual. They offered me the fourth season of "Collusion". - The fourth? - Yes, it's going well. - Well, the criticisms are excellent. - The series always have excellent reviews. - What is your doubt? If you still do the cop - She's not a cop! She is an expert on crisis situations. (laughing) Ok. No, it's ... I get the impression to drag me without progressing. Then stop. Yes, but they can't replace me. I have the impression of being a hostage. If you have no choice, then continue. If I accept, I will have it for another six months. (DOOR OPENING) Hey, you, what are you doing here? - I had a bad dream. - Well? Then? Where is your bed? Where is your bed? Where is your bed? - It's over there! - You had a nightmare or did you dream of sleeping with mom and dad? (LAUGHING) You're a rascal! A rascal who wants a little tickle! - A little tickling! - Come on, let's go to bed. - Daddy reads you a story. Presto! - In bed. - (Martin) Again! O-issa! Here it is. Here we go in bed upside down. Upside down! Uh-uh! (MARTIN AND ALAIN LAUGH) - What have you got? - Oh, nothing. Anything... Agree. Yesterday I saw ... Alain at lunch. - And is Alain all right? - Yes, it seems to me that he is well. - Well, the other day it seemed a bit down. - Oh yes? Down ... Down like? He just looked down. I mean not up. He is very well. He seemed fit. - I'm happy. - In excellent shape. Mm ... fantastic! Mm. He refused my ... my manuscript. And how is Selena? Well, I don't know, I haven't seen it. I'd like to have dinner with them. I just told you who refused my manuscript. Okay, I get it. What can I do about it? - Be supportive. - I'm sympathetic! You will work on your text again and you will improve it. What should I do, cry? It didn't even go away for the head that could be wrong, ... .. who perhaps missed something in the book? No, it's true, I didn't think about it. But it's your editor. - So what? - Then nothing, he is right, otherwise he changes editor. Yes, but I don't know others. It's been years Alain publishes my books. What should I ... That's what I said. Rework to your text. I'm working on it for more than a year, in short ... - I'm not very polished anymore. - Do you want me to encourage you? - Yup. - I knew it. - Then do it. - No. Can't you find that Alain has changed? You too, and me too. We all change over time. - But he for the worse, no? - Mm ... No, I'd say for the better. - What makes you think so? - It seems more responsible, more solid. - His judgment has strengthened. - Ah! Well... - Thank you very much. - Don't take it like that! The Vertheuil Editions are a success editorial. Literary awards, awards ... - It wasn't so obvious! - It is a publishing house that is over 100 years old. - Look how it was put before Alain. - Feel the spirit of the times, but don't ... - Eh, yes, it takes talent to succeed. - A commercial talent! You're unfair, it's always demanding. Many publishers envy his catalog. Oh, shit! I have to go, I have a busy day. I'll talk about it when I come back, if you want. - What is the urgency? - There are local elections in Mayenne. - David goes to give his support to the candidate. - I saw it on TV. The situation seems difficult. - Yes, quite a lot. - Are you going with him? - Yes, we meet the strikers at the foundries. The company is in receivership. Negotiations on working conditions are stopped ... - I know the case. - And you do well? Well yes... I finish working on the train. We must be able to resume dialogue or we have no hope. Hello! - Did you call Jean-Pierre? - Yes I have left two messages, but did not respond. - Tell him we will "online" his text tonight. - Agree. - Thank you. (SHOTS TO DOOR) - Good evening, Laure. - Good evening. - You are welcome. - Please, take a seat. - Thank you. I'm glad to see you. We still need to know each other. Mine is a new role. I have always the impression that it is not clear what I do. By now everyone knows the importance of digital development. - This is exactly what is scary. - "And yet I advance on tiptoe". But I find that in the publishing world digital is a bit demonized. This is no longer the case. Unfortunately or fortunately. This is why I try to be patient, and above all humble. It's not what we ask. There is a lot to learn from a publishing house with this story. Yes, well ... let's try not to be too old-fashioned. - It was a compliment. - A bit' poisoned. - Something needs changing. When I talk about opportunities, ... .. when I look at the years to come, I feel like the bird of ill omen. - He's here to move the habits a little. - Till where? - What are you referring to? - Is there a limit to what I can move? This is for you to say. Look, if we want to go to the end, it's all to be rethought. - Let's get here. You are welcome. - Thank you. We should give visibility to our initiative. Because we are not communicating it. - Do you have any suggestions? - I have an opportunity in mind. - Have you read Robert Clarence's manuscript? - I'm pretty skeptical. A collection of texts and tweets: how to open the door to anything. Let's say it is a particular novelty. - And it's not even a novelty, they have already done it. - It's true. - Mallarmé has published the verses of circumstance. - I didn't think of Mallarmé. With mail addresses. "Mr. Monet, whose sight is not deceived neither in winter nor in summer, ... " "..lives while he paints in Giverny, near Vernon, in Eure. " I'm impressed. (Laure) Thanks. The SMS is a modern form of writing. Everyone uses it, speaks to everyone. - Maybe. - Tweets are haikus moderns, Clarence proves it. - I respect your opinion. - I thought of publishing a paper version and one for Smartphone. Why not read Clarence on the phone? I see that he is reticent, but in terms of image it works. - We have published e-mails. - Seen? It's not the same thing, it's letters. Some treat correspondence, others don't. Whether written by hand or computer, does not change much. When we published the correspondence by Castelli, e-mails were like paper. - We remain in the old patterns. - She is strict. (SHOOTING) (Agent) Get out, go! (SHOOTING) (Agent) Man on the ground! (Agent) Inside! (Agent) This way! (SCARES AND URL) (Man) Sons of bitches! (FIRE) (Man) Oh, don't shoot! Don't shoot, we give up! (Director) Stop! - Well done. - It went well. - I wasn't really there. - But no! I lost my concentration. - I was hit by a cartridge. It is the third time they take me. - Where did it hit you? (BUZZ) - (Man) How's it going? - Always the same. It is very physical. Physical. - It's hard? - A little, but it's good work on energy. All right. Jerôme is better with bodies that with ideas. Honestly, I'm a little tired of all these stories of revenge. - It's a pretext. - For me it is not interesting revenge, especially when it legitimizes violence. - Don't you like what you do? - Yes. I am happy, I do my best, but ... - I don't find it very much. - Yup. - How are you with Alain? - Well. - Problems? - I think Alain sees himself with another. - Do you think so or do you know? - I feel it. - And you don't want to talk to him? - Honestly I do not know. - I don't understand you, it's always better to talk about it. - Not it's always better. If it were true, what could I do with it? He will lie. And what do I want? I want to break up? Is this really what I want? - Do you prefer hypocrisy? - What's that got to do with it? We have been married for 20 years. You can't keep it intact desire all this time. - Would you find it legitimate if it betrayed you? - Betrays me! - But you said you're not sure. - No, I'd put my hand on the fire. - And you're ready to accept it. - I don't think you don't love me, maybe you love me more. - Why? - Because he feels guilty. He knows he could lose me. Fear brings him closer to me. - I do not recognize you. - In a couple there is something beyond desire. - Do you already have a title or some anticipation? - No, no. - OK. Will Vertheuil always publish it? - I'm still not sure to give it to them. - Ah OK. No, because we need to renew ourselves. I think it's good to find ... Excuse me, we need to start. Should be everyone arrived. If he comes with me to the table ... (BUZZ) Good evening! Thank you all for coming, for being faithful to our Friday night meetings. You are a little less numerous than usual. But it's cold and there are problems to metro line 2. So, I wouldn't want to wait still our guest. - Welcome Leonard Spiegel. - Good evening. - It's a pleasure to have you here. To talk about a demanding work, and still little known. So, I ask you the first question. - "Farewells in a low voice" is a novel avowedly autobiographical. - Yes but... Yes and no. All the novels they are a bit autobiographical. - We can recognize ... - Yes ... Solange. - In the character of Véronique Pastoureau. For those who know it, it's pretty clear. But for those who don't know it, who is the real Solange? I mean, what does it matter if I was inspired by her or another? In my opinion, the reader will replace you his memories, his imagination. The result will be a character imaginary, as if invented. At least I think. Are there any questions? - Please, sir. - What do you think of the controversy that rages on his book? - What controversy? - On the Internet. - As on Intern Yes, maybe she missed it, but it is a very heated debate. - I didn't follow him at all. - Maybe it's better for her. One wonders if the writers can be inspired by real people. - Of course, we always do it, from that world is world. - It's not a good reason. His ex-wife wrote to feel violated. And the network has arisen. There is an old question still open between us. She haunts me. It is making a settlement of accounts, almost. - Even his book seems a settlement of accounts. - No. It's his point of view. It is debatable. It can be considered, in effect, that each individual is the owner of his own image. - It's up to him to use it as he wants. - So it's about money, right? - My life is worth something. If you use it, at least pay me. - Now I understand. What can I do about it? My life it's my relationship with others. Subjective, if you want, but in short ... - I have no right to use it by telling what i know - Good question. - The answer is not obvious. - And if anyone didn't he agree, like his ex-wife? - Or would you like to use your own story? - It would be absolutely free to do so! But no. Since you used it, he is no longer a virgin. - There is an image market, they have a market value. - Non-commercial. Yup! Proof? He made a book out of it. It is for sale and has a certain price. - The life of others has a value. - Exactly. - Solange has the right to request an account. - (Laure) Good morning. - Miss d'Angerville ... - Thank you. - Room 21. - Mr. Danielson, I guess. - Yup. - Room 10. Last floor. - Thank you. - Good morning. - Hello. - Hello, I'm Blaise. - Pleasure. - Thank you so much for being here. - Not at all, thanks to you. I present you Laure, takes care of all digital editions. - We exchanged messages. - Ah. By computer, yes. We can sit here. - You are welcome. - Thank you. - I'll take that. - Do you need a chair? - No, please. - Thank you. - Do you drink anything? - For me, a beer. - Yes for me too. - OK it's good. Joe, two beers. Indeed, three. - I'm sorry. - Imagine. For me the real topic of tomorrow ... ..is the way the technology makes access to culture democratic. I don't see what democracy has to do with it. - Everything is always available for everyone. - Not everything, not for everyone. Let's say digital technology it's like a utopia. He's right. All digitalized books in the world from Google available online. It's a revolution. There are more than 20 million works! And the largest library in the world and is virtual. That is, Google has taken it hostage all our literary memory ... .. to resell the data of users to advertisers. - Nothing is done for philanthropy. - Questionable. The idea that trade, companies or advertising ... .. they can legitimately appropriate themselves of the circulation of knowledge ... ..it is modern, but does not convince me at all. Publishing is also trade. It will also be regrettable, but I don't see how we can go back. Yes, it's today's world. He doesn't come asked for nothing and then it is too late. It is a fact that the consultation in the library it will no longer make sense. Libraries will keep books, but the contents will be dematerial - Thank you. - Thank you. - Is it good or bad, in your opinion? - A good, obviously. - Health. - Because it would be bad. Ask a writer who seeks a description or want to check a memory. To a scientist who compares his research with the others in his field. You have a municipal library. I saw the sign. It's a media library. Contains books but also CDs, DVDs. - And it works? - They go there especially children, because they love to read. The homeless. It's hot, they can use the Internet ... And then the elderly. There is a granoteca. And what is a granoteca? There are wooden containers in which people exchange seeds. These are structures which are destined to disappear. We will need to reconvert them. It is inevitable. - I get up, I have to go. - Stay. Blaise is waiting for us at breakfast. - I thought about it, I don't agree with you. - What about? - Have you seen Bergman's movie "Lights in winter"? - I didn't see anything about Bergman. Do you recommend it? There is a priest who has lost his faith, but continues to celebrate mass in an empty church. - Are you the priest? - No, and for now the church is not completely empty. - I do not understand. - It's a question of faith. We do not agree on this. - I understand even less. - I'm not talking about religion. We dedicate our lives to an idea, in this case to the books, but the idea goes beyond it. Not necessarily. In reverse, we question it and evolve. We even try to overcome it. (ALAIN RIDACCHIA) - Why are you laughing? - Because you always report everything digitally. The point is digital, that makes us lose any kind of reference. It makes us reinvent, it's a challenge. Maybe yes, but I'm not talking about what is transformed, but of what remains the same. We are also the custodians of an idea that runs through time. Even when we doubt, when the church is empty. - I was sure, you are the priest. - No, it's just an example. Sometimes you have to believe in an idea even against all evidence. And at the conference is this what you will tell? No, I will talk about what they are interested in. How the digital edition took over an important dimension in our work. - And soon the only one. - Yes, I understand, I leave you to your certainties. Thank you. Alain Danielson. Thank you. You question many preconceptions of the publishing world. Let's talk about the future, so it is only speculation. But they are matters that cannot be avoided. And I suppose they'll raise many questions in the present audience. Yes, please. Maybe I'll be trivial. Don't you think it's just about money? - The books are too expensive. - (Blaise) It's a done, the Kindle versions cost half. Yes. Especially for those has a low pension, makes a difference. So, it is true that the realization of digital books does not cost anything, but ... Is this really the problem? It's definitely part of the problem. You see, in our society they come respected money and power. More books will cost and more will be respected. He will admit that it is a bit paradoxical. It cannot be either for democratization of books than for dissuasive prices. And who says I am for democratization? No, I'm kidding. But I wouldn't mind that the books be valued more. What do you think of the Espresso Book Machine? Sorry. I translate for non-specialists. The Espresso Book Machine allows you to print books on request. A car you would find in a bookstore. That is, select a book on a monitor, press a button ... ..and the book is printed in five minutes. - Identical to a book that came out of the typography. - Not exactly identical. Is it a nostalgic of cardboard covers? In the United States, the original edition hardcover, carefully packaged, sells well. When it is exhausted, the pocket edition comes out. Wait. (SELENA RIDE) - Hey ... - Mm? I have to go! - Ssh ... - Aspe ... Stop that! Come on, leave me ... (PAIN PAIN) - Leave me. I will be late. - Come on... - No, I'll be late. - Let's sleep... (SCHIOCCHI DI BACI) - Stop that. - Let's sleep! (DISCOVER WATER OF THE SHOWER) Leonard? (VERSI DI LEONARD AND URLA DI SELENA) (SELENA RIDE) Is it okay there? There. Thank you. - I read your book. - You took it easy. You're joking, eh? - Do you really think it's like Xenia? Wait, Xenia is a fictional character. An invented character quite intuitive. For those who know me, it is not difficult to identify myself. No, but listen ... Alain didn't really think about it, so ... Meaning? What did you tell him? I told him, discreetly, ... ..for the character I was inspired by Stephanie Volkowski. - Stephanie ?! - Yes, to confuse the waters! - Do you find me like Stephanie ?! - No, it's the first name that came to mind. - You find that vulgar talk show funny on Channel 8? - For nothing. - Me neighter. - Well, since Alain knows I had one story with her ... - which does you no credit! - Yes, but it's more credible than if I had said Taylor Swift. - It would have been more flattering. Besides, you've got yourself also some too much freedom on the facts. - Really? - Really. - What, for example? - The scene where he sucks it in the cinema. - Mm. - true? - Didn't happen? - Well, not exactly. If you remember, it was during "Star Wars:the awakening of strength." - I just changed the title of the movie! - Certainly a Haneke film is more chic! - "The white ribbon" then ... - Come on, it's a transposition. - Sure! - Like the weekend in Seville during Holy Week ... - Yes. - That's not true. - Yes ... No, no, it was ... - It was the book fair ... in Brive. - Yes, of course, so it's more glamorous, of course. - It's more romantic. - I thought you hated romance. No, I wouldn't say. In fact, I think I'm coming back. Slowly, calmly, I'm coming back. Will you accompany me to smoke a cigarette? - Did you go with another to Seville? - No, I never set foot there. - I used Wikipedia, Google. Seems true, eh? - Yup. I like the scene where they lose the procession of penitents ... ..and spend the day at the Alcazar gardens. It seems that those gardens are beautiful. - We could go to Seville. - Sure, whenever you want. - Do you say that Alain didn't read between the lines? - Of course not. No. - He doesn't want to publish it, though. - Yes, it's a bit disheartening. I liked it. It's one of your best books. - And did you tell her? - Yes, yes. - Has it had any effect? - No, nobody. He barely reacted. Will it be a way to get revenge? - Do you think I know anything? - No, I don't know ... It's just ... Consciously or unconsciously could suspect. - You mean that for unconscious reasons ... - But very intense! - .. does not publish the book? - Yup. Thank you. Good evening. See you later. - Valérie, how are you? - Hello! Sorry for the delay. - We didn't expect you anymore. - I come directly from Laval. - Do not worry. Give me your stuff. - OK. - Hi everyone. How are you? - Hello sweetheart my. - Sorry for the delay. Arrival from Laval. - Do you know I called you 10 times? - Yes, I had a dead battery. - On both phones? - Yup! - You could ask to load them in a bar. - I'll put one in office there. - Thank you. - And in the kitchen there's an outlet. - Thank you. - Imagine. - Never heard of Laval. - Me neighter. - Listen, Valérie, where is Laval? - It's in the Mayenne, for your information. - Excuse the ignorance, but where is the Mayenne? No, but is it a joke? You're kidding me! - No, it's South, East, West? Seriously... - I know, it's in the Massif Central. That's Pierre Laval, Prime Minister of Vichy. He comes from the Massif Central. - But it's serious! Laval! - Well, what is it? -The countries of the Loire. With the TGV you arrive in 90 minutes. - Wait ... Do you know what the TGV is? - Ah, no, I never took a TGV. Never! - Valérie, hold on, take back. - Yes, I really need it. - Drink up. - To your. - To yours! - Health. - And above all to your book "La palude". I found it very interesting, a mixture of fiction and reality. - Really? - Yes thanks. Then? Did it go well today? Thanks for asking but it was a disaster. The owner of the foundry is a primitive and so there was no dialogue. - I believe this will weigh on the elections. - But it will be good for David's image. - What do you mean? - He takes the side of the strikers, gives it a less neutral image. It is not an image, it is a reality. He's very busy, that's why he's a politician. - Makes politics to be elected. - Quite right! - Obviously, but stop nodding! - I only have said "right". - Of course he wants to be elected. But who would say, "No, no, I want to lose"? It is obvious that he makes politics to be elected. - To be elected, you must manage yours image, and he is very good. - It's true. - Acts according to his convictions. - And let him know. He acts according to his convictions and communicates it. A photo with the strikers can come in handy. But anyway, how cynical you are! - No? - It's not a question of cynicism, I also think of it as Carsten. - (Man) Or you are cynical too. - It is possible. - But what is the problem? - Come, it's ready! - You can't do politics as it used to be. We have entered a new era. - I say to you! It's ready. - Thing should it be done then? - You change system. The system is the same:reality. It is always like this. - Taxes, work, school, security ... - It's more complex. - It's really simple. Think of the actual temperature and that perceived. Real and perceived are different things. - We must work on the perceived as well as on the real. - Okay, but what is the perception determined by? From information. From a widespread climate. - Here it is. Information no longer exists. - Yes that exists, don't say that. There is only one information supermarket, ... .. where everyone does their shopping with your cart. Internet is not just this. We can choose where to shop. (Carsten) Everyone reads what he wants to read, which comforts his opinions. Sources can be demanding with quality. I have always made a choice, at least I believe. - Exactly, you believe. - You can make a selection. (VIBRATION OF A CELL) (LEONARD RIDE) What makes you laugh? Nothing, a joke. A friend sent me the manifesto of "Star Wars:the awakening of strength". - Funny, tell us too. - It is not so interesting, and then it's hard to explain. - Can you break off your cell phone for one evening, please? - Yes, yes, now I turn it off. (Man) It is always the same, only that they have different titles. - Can I get you one? - Sure. They are slim, though. - They are fine, thanks. - I think I'll taste something now. - I'll take your jacket. - Yes, go ahead. - Such as? - Very good. - Where did you get fork? - There. - Ah, thanks. - How cold. I agree with Valérie. Politics is played first of all on the field. - Not only. - Yes, of course, but you have to start from there. - On the condition of having concrete results in the field of which you speak. - But when? Immediately? - Yes, immediately. - Can not be done, politics needs time. - Not against David, it's very reputable to me. - Do you find it reputable? - I really appreciate David. To the words of politicians rarely follow the facts, don't you find? - It's true, that's why you don't trust them more than them. - Who doesn't trust anymore? - You don't trust anymore? - No, people. - People? And who are the people? - People are people. - And you? What do you think? - But nothing, I observe. - Don't think anything. It's too easy like this. I'm cold. - What's this? Couscous? - Yes it is good. - Thanks, that's enough. - Public opinion is won day by day. The battlefield is that communication that you despise, in real time. - So it's all allowed? Is it so? - It is what is called post-truth. - I have been thinking for a long time that we are in post-truth. - What does post-truth mean? It means allowing people to live in a fictitious universe determined by their prejudices. But do you think people are so naive? I think we all need to certainties, even more so in an uncertain world. You think they don't see intentions hidden behind messages? I do, I think they analyze all in a tremendously lucid manner. - You are optimistic. - Oh, I'm not optimistic at all. Indeed, no, I think this lucidity you don't need anything! - Finally ... They exhausted me. - Why? - It was a pleasant evening. - A pleasant evening ?! Everything but pleasant! They do not have did nothing but spit on politics and David. - Do you want water? - Ah, yes, thank you. Not be susceptible, there was no malice. - No one was insidious and sneaky. - Yes, Carsten. - The others too. - The others less. - Sara... - I like Carsten. Although he is a little bear, I find that "La palude" is an interesting book. - It's nice. - Alain detests him, you told me you didn't want to publish it. - But in fact it is very successful. - So? Do you feel justified in saying everything and more? It is not really so. He has some experience of the political world, you can't deny it. - He was a political journalist on the radio, not it has nothing to do with it. - Of course? He knows the industry. - But what does the sector have to do with it! - But why now ... The industry does not know it at all, at most he knows people who know him. - U Got It Bad. Very very bad. - Yes, I have it taken badly. Am I not right to take it well? - I do a difficult job, I work hard and I have to be insulted ... - No one has insulted you. Did you hear the tone? The tone with which did they talk to me? Disdain for politics? - People today express themselves this way, don't pretend to be amazed. - So? This is not a good reason. - Wait, stay here. - Stop it, please. - No, we were ... - Leave me, come on! Leave me alone! - He didn't speak against you, he was more against David. - I know, it's even worse. - You know David well. - Of course, I know him. - And what do you think? - I find it great worker, very honest, very ... busy. - We agree. - Yes, but it's also true that I don't want to vote for him. - Why, are you dying to vote? - Well, no. - Well, so what? - I appreciate it as a person. But in addition to the sympathy that inspires me, it doesn't really embody my political ideas. Sorry, but who embodies your political ideas? I don't know, like ... Genghis Khan! He did. - Oh really? - And Attila. He yes, see? - Attila ?! - Here, yes. - Beautiful. - Jack the Ripper! - Oh yes, Jack the Ripper, it's even better! - Ah, he did. - Yes. He did. Well, come on, I've never been a supporter of the established order. No, you prefer disorder. I don't have a good relationship with authority. And what is the opposite of authority? - Chaos. - Ah, chaos is better. - Do you prefer it? - Theoretically, yes, because it's more productive. "Theoretically ..." "Theoretically, yes, it is more productive." Well, basically, maybe I'm not so sure it works, in fact. You betray me, Leonard? - Why ... Why do you ask? - I don't know, it occurred to me first. So I don't want to keep it for myself. Such as? When? First, at dinner, when you read that message. - But it was stupid. - I don't know, the way you smiled ... - What way? - And then you immediately deleted the message. - No, I do that automatically. - "Don't pack yourself", please. - You're the one who insinuated ... - You love Me? Yup. Because I love you. Really. Also ... if we're not never really agree? Especially because we don't agree on anything. (LEONARD IMITATES THE VERSE OF A CAT THAT MAKES THE CASTINGS Oh, how nice to see you! Did you find it easily? With the works, the indications are very bad. - I followed the navigator. - How are you? - You make yourself want. - Here, we've got them coming. - Not you had to. Thank you! - I don't guarantee quality. - The shop I know was closed. - It's the thought that counts. - Good morning. - Pleasure. - Hello. - Nice to meet you. - How are you? - Fine thanks. - Do you know each other? - Good morning. - Guy Fonville. Alain Danielson. - Political Science, right? - Yes, we have two years of difference. - Good morning. - Pleasure. - And Selena needs no introduction. I saw her in the second season of "Collision". Very good. - What is "Collision"? - Don't you know her? - No. - You would like it, it's a genius series. - A Tv series? -It is actually "Collusion", not "Collision". - "Collusion", it is true. - "Collusion" and not ... - "Collusion". It's a better title. - I'm a fan. - You never get bored. "On the razor's edge". And then he has nothing to envy to the American series. Is it difficult to be a cop? She's not really a policewoman, it is rather an expert on crisis situations. - It's a very physical role. She is a strong woman. - Ah, yes, but I like to play with the body. And then it's interesting to follow the same character over time. And more, now ... people recognize me on the street. - More than before? - There is no comparison when I was acting Lars Noren at the Odeon did not reach the general public. - Selena, do you want some coffee? - Oh yes. Thank you. - Alain, do you want a coffee? - No thanks. - Have you seen the match? - No. Did you go? - Ah, they disgusted me. - Penalty in the fifth minute, very difficult to recover. - They just did crap. - Total defeat! Total. - Do you know who Xavier Dehoux is? - That one of telephony. - Yes, and many other things. - He's a very nice guy. A great indie rock fans. - Really? - Yup. He made a rather unusual journey. He started with Minitel in the 80s, before the Internet. - I read your Libération profile. - Yup. Now he wants to develop an information center and needs content. - For telephony? - Yes. It's accumulating a spoil of war and seeks new acquisitions. - So you will sell? - Well, publishing is not on the rise. Nor is it a loss-making sector. - We had given ourselves three years to catch up. - We made it? No. The figures say no, but we are on the right track. My shareholders expect good roads, expect profits. - And then prestige? - That's fine if you can make money. Not my case. Why did you invest in publishing? Because e-book sales had to explode, but that's what the analysts said, you first. - They said it was the future. - It will happen. Yes, but the opposite is happening. Sales plunge:less 15% in 2016. According to American statistics. - 15% is a lot. - It's an established trend. - What is it due to? - Prices have gone up, readers have fallen. - They are always cheaper than books. - Perhaps, but we have reached a critical threshold. - Do you know what? The sale of books has increased. - It's a contradiction. Reading habits change quickly. The audiobooks really take off. Yes, I noticed. - The audiobooks read by the stars. - Yes, exactly, read by the stars. We read more and more about tablets, on smartphones, less on e-readers. - On smartphones? - Yes, it's crazy! People read books on smartphones! - That's why synergy with telephony. - Exactly. - And with Xavier Dehoux. According to the market, must make a statement. It's time to sell. - Will you sell the Vertheuil Editions? - Well, I'm really tempted, old man. It would allow me to get out of it with my head high and to get a nice benefit. But I wanted to talk to you first. What do you think about it? - What, to sell? - No, e-books. Do they still have a margin of progress or is it over? (DOOR OPENING) Selena told us she read the new manuscript by Leonard Spiegel. - Really? This is new to me. - He says it's one of his best. Yes, at least, that's what I think. - "Foundation" I liked. - It's not recent. - Also "Police Report". - Yes, that too. - He didn't sell much. How is the new one called? - I do not remember. - "Final point". Ah yes, here. "Final point". Exact. - What do you want to do? - To sell. - And would you sell it together with the furniture? When the owner changes, change the strategy. I don't think I would stay. - Yes, but did you make a decision or ...? - There is no concrete offer. - He's negotiating ... with Dehoux. - Dehoux? What is Dehoux? A businessman of dubious fame who made a fortune with digital. You said that digital it was the future of publishing. Now the figures say the opposite. But think a little! - You played your cards well. Brava, eh! - About what? Leonard's book, of course. I don't oblige you. - I will have the right to love a book and to talk about it. - I do not doubt it. - Two, thanks. - Why don't you want to publish it? Why do you want me to publish it? - Honestly? - I don't want to force you to be honesty. - It really exposes itself. For the first time. - Well, yes ... - It's always the same, it self-analyzes ... - It's more complex. - Good evening. - Hello. - Er ... the number 5. - 92 euros. - This too, thanks. - Even that. - 95 euros in all. With the excuse of trudging through the mud, you authorize to tell horrors about everyone. - He fed me up. - In this book less. Can you turn on the light? - Thank you. - Where's Martin? - From my mother. And when does he bring it back? I do not know. They went to the amusement park. - Will he be able to do his homework? - They probably found traffic. (MUSIC FROM TV) Lower it, please! - My ears hurt. - Ah, sorry. Leonard is fumbling. I'm tired of fumbling with him. - A new publisher would do him good. - You are wrong. Leave it right now that it is free. The book will like it. What makes you say that? You can no longer see him with detachment. It is your relationship that is worn out. I don't like how she talks about women. Does it bother you? - What is the name of that girl who does that talk show on Channel 8? - Stephanie. - Stephanie Volkowski, yes. - Yup. - He went to bed, it's a well-known thing. - So? - You recognize it immediately. He changed the name ... - Xenia? - It's so clear. - It didn't really come to me. You must be the only one. Who cares? They will be in very few to wonder who he really is. If I make tea, do you take it too? - Gladly. - OK. The scene of when didn't bother you are they going to see "The White Ribbon"? - Beautiful movie. - Yes, we saw it together. Oh yes, it's true. Yup. - It's very raw. - What do they do? The complacency with which he describes it. So? It's very embarrassing for you, don't you think? - Does it bother you? - Like the scene of the Turkish bath in Seville. - What's the problem? - Treats it as an object. Maybe that's what she likes. It is what it implies. Personally it bothers me. The point is if it's good literature. Yes, but I feel tremendously uncomfortable for Stephanie Volkowski. - What's that got to do with it? - If I see it on TV, I think of "The White Ribbon". - (laughing) But stop it! - I really mean it bothers me. - Come on, Alain! But now I will have to publish it. Why? You do what you want. It is the first time in 10 years that Marc-Antoine is interested in a book. - No, it is the companion who seems interested. - Yes, it's the same thing. (Laure) Mm-mm. Yup. (VOICES INDISTINTO FROM THE PHONE) (Laure) I agree with you. I still haven't convinced Alain. Kiss. Would you give me the keys again? Have you changed your mind? It's over. Is it for Alain? I read the messages. - Since when do you read me the messages? - More or less always. - Do you want? - I don't want anything, thanks. - It's not for Alain. - Partially yes. - I thought you preferred women. - I prefer women, in fact. Not exclusively. - Is it serious? - It's intended to finish soon, but we will remain friends. Don't you want to be with him? He is married and has a son. I really don't think he wants to leave them. It is better that way. And then I'm leaving. - Where is it? - I couldn't talk about it. I did an interview. It's a tempting offer. Marketing management for a European-level media group. - And where will you go? - In London. I've already lived there. - Thank you. - Good evening, sir. - Thank you too. I saw that you wrote a report on the future of literary criticism. - Did you read it? - No, I just browsed. You are not very positive. They are facts, information found on the Internet. Take what interests you and throw the rest. Is that the trend? The role of critics in favor of writers has weakened. It's a quick involution that must be anticipated. - Like newspapers that lose readers? - Yup. - Yes, but for the benefit of them digital editions. - Or blogs. - So what changes? - Which is written differently for the web. Care is taken to optimize the use of keywords. To be indexed by robots. - Excuse me, what robots? - They manage the personal information for search engines. - You can also test the virality of the titles. - I mean, if a security isn't viral, change it. - Yup. I don't understand where you want to go. Indexed, viral ... Criticism supports books. Until a certain point. It has a subjectivity which is not necessarily that of your target. - I have no target. - Of course you have it. Publish books to sell them. And the more you let those interested know, the better it is for you. - I don't like to think like that. - But it's been so long since. Speak directly to your potential readers, instead of inviting critics to lunch. You do not need the subjectivity of intermediaries, today there are algorithms. Thank you. Algorithms that tell me what? Analyze your personal data. If you bought diapers, if you took a trip to Israel, ... ..You've seen a documentary about Indonesia o James Bond streaming ... - If you searched for a gay icon ... - It is clear, I understand. They identify you, anticipate tastes. You are more predictable than you think. See the tips on Amazon. They work. In the future we will trust the most algorithms based on consumer habits ... ... of the critics pleased with his power. - You're severe. - Any form of power power, today, is questioned. The algorithms do not contribute to the exchange of views. If you talk about analysis or reflection, it's completely different. There will always be blogs more or less followed. - I'm talking about sales. - In terms of sales, nothing is ever defined. - The research does not say. - And what do the research say? Who buys the records, who goes to the movies, the readers,... .. they act like influencers who follow on Twitter or friends on Facebook. But you know that most like are handled by hackers paid for it. However on the net they have effects that reflect a contemporary sensibility. Do you think it's a good thing? I don't have an opinion. - Do you come back to the office? - Yes, I have to get my stuff back. - And you? - Yes, I left my car keys. I found this one there. - It's a gift. - (Laure) A gift? - For what? - Ah, you know. - No. - Goodbye. - Why farewell? - Why are you leaving? - How do you know it? - Mm! I know. - Do you know that long? - In real time. Do you know Emeline Rittenberg? - Will you replace me? - I'm waiting for an answer. - (Laure) She is very ambitious. - He loves money above all. - Will you be paid more than me? - Eh, yes. Do I love money enough? You are interested in other things. - Besides sex? - Besides sex? Well, I don't know. The power. - It's not true. - Questionable. And publishing, in your own way. Otherwise you would do something else, more remunerative. I also believe that you are more connected to literature than I want to admit. My father was a writer. I read his poems. - (Laure) I didn't know. - And I like them very much. I had other offers, but I thought I was useful here. - At what? - To contribute to reflection on XXI century publishing. - To reinvent it, perhaps. - Must be reinvented? It will change radically. - I'm less convinced of you. - (Laure) Everything will change. But change you have to choose it, don't suffer it. Remember what the Prince of Salina says at the end of "Il Gattopardo"? Yes sure. "Everything must change so that nothing changes". Exactly. It's a strange quote. - (Laure) Why? - Everyone repeats it, I hear it everywhere. Thank you, I didn't think you were that ruthless. I'm not talking about you, I'm just saying that finds more feedback today ... ..which when Tomasi di Lampedusa he wrote it half a century ago. Why is it the end of a world? Perhaps there is reason to be worried. - Good morning. - (Barista) Good morning. (UNBEARABLE DIALOGUE) - Yes, I take a coffee, please. - (Barista) Immediately. And a glass of water, big. (Barista) Yes. Thank you for coming to my area. And sorry the hour, but I have the footage at dawn. No problem. Um ... double coffee and a juice, please. Thank you. There ... there ... I brought you the book. He arrived last night. Thank you. I wrote you a dedication. "For you, Selena ..." Thank you. Very nice. "Final point". Bold as a title. - Why? - Well, it gives the impression that you won't write anymore. Well, thank you very much. (LEONARD HITS THE BANK) - What are you doing? - Beat on the wood. - It's not wood. - And what is it? - I don't know, a coating made of plastic, but not wood. - Oh yes? Like Thomas Bernhard, who wrote "Extinction" and then died. (SELENA RIDE) But then you've decided to destroy my morale. C'mon I was joking! Well, it's a bad joke. Well, you could tell me before the title, right? I did not think about it. - Seeing it printed, he came to me in mind. - Stop responding to messages. I don't know why I hadn't noticed it before. No! And should I draw a conclusion? You do a little. Maybe ... are you busy with the series? Don't have more time? It is not a question of time. It's a matter of ... wear. Wear. - Do you know how long we've been together? - I don't know, but "together" is a little excessive. I would say we have a story ... quite fragmented. - Six years. - I wouldn't have told you, you know? Yes. Do the accounts. Oh, no ice in the juice. - (Barista) All right. - They bring in more ice than juice. So it means that won't you come with me to Naples? How do you say? Feelings are always mutual. If I don't come, it's also because ... you don't want me to come. - Are you trying to tell me it's over? - A little more than trying. Well, I think we have to ... I have to give myself some time to try to do things right. Leonard, it's already happened, we're just saying it clearly. I have no time to discuss it now. This morning we go around the suburbs, I'm in a hurry. - To her. - Thank you. - Was this urgent? - No, not exactly. Actually, I wanted ... I wanted to ask you something precise. Not to make a book of it. - No. No, no, I don't want to. - Even ... despite the temptation. No I will not do it. - If you do, I won't forgive you. - I promise you. - I will not save your book as the last one time, I assure you. - I promise, I won't. - I'd tear you to pieces. You can't imagine yourself! - I imagine. - I would make your life hell. I think I got the message, you were very clear. - Do I have to repeat it? - No, it's okay. Message received. - Do you want to share a Uber with me? I go in Bastille. - No, I calmly finish my coffee. I have an interview on the radio this afternoon. We have many programs public information. - The special editions of the newsletter during the elections ... - Ah. Theater programs, talk shows with the studio audience ... ..and the concerts we play live and in full. Take a seat, I come back two minutes before the live. - Do you need something? - No no thanks. - See you later. I take this opportunity to give you a little summary. There is still not much, but something should move during the week. - Are you OK? You look a little bit already. - No, I'm fine. Ok. The good news is that to the journalist of "Female Version" is liked. - "Female Version"? - It's very read. Really. He has a much followed blog. - Then there's Pierre Schultz, from whom I wait a feedback. - Forget it, he hates me. It's not true. I gave him the book myself, he was happy. He really enjoyed the title, he said it was a good choice. He asked me about you. We talked a little ... We've known each other since high school, he never spoke well of a book of mine. For "Police Report" I think he had written a nice article. He told me. (MOBILE VIBRATION) Did you read the article? - No, eight years ago I was still in college. - It's a rattlesnake. (IMITATE SIBILO DEL SERPENTE) - Your turn. Come with me. - We arrive. ("ABRASIVE" MUSIC BY RATATAT) - Sit in front of the yellow microphone. - Hello. - Hello. - Hello. - Hi how are you? - Fine thanks. - You are welcome. - Hello. - Hello. - I introduce you. Leonard. Sophie. Sophie. Leonard. We are about to begin. You are welcome. ("ABRASIVE" MUSIC BY RATATAT) Hi, today is Leonard Spiegel with us, author of "Foundation", "Farewells in a low voice", ... .. who returns with a new novel, "Final point". - But, Leonard, is this really a novel? - Well, yes, I claim the term "novel". Okay, novel, but it's not anymore a fictional autobiography? Yes, I know this kind exists, but I don't know exactly what it means. - So let's see ... The narrator his name is Leonard. Am I wrong? - Exactly. - Are you a writer? - Yes. - He lives in yours same neighborhood and apartment. - Yup. And who knows you a little, can recognize some figures in your life. - Actually it's more complex than that. - I think it's pretty clear. So we wondered by Michael Haneke ... - There's a pretty strong scene that maybe he didn't like it. - Yup. - During a screening of "The White Ribbon". - Yes. - It's very disturbing. Yes a bit', but it is to make people laugh, that is the purpose. Everyone has his sense of humor. But there remains a film on the rise of Nazism. It creates a certain unease. Leonard Spiegel ... To get back to the fictional autobiography, you can summarize the plot of "The White Ribbon"? - Yes, yes. Yes, of course, with pleasure. - You are welcome. - Er ... - Even briefly. So, it's a film about Germany ... before the war ... It's ... a vintage movie. - There are some tweets ... Generally positive. - Let me see. - Not all of them. - Not everyone, but it's not a very happy time. (CELL PHONE) - We're waiting for a reply tonight. - Sorry. - Hello? - I heard you. It seemed very interesting, very pungent. - Yes I agree. - Yes, it's not one complacent him. - Not at all, no. He's good at the interviewer. He doesn't ask the usual flunkies questions. Yes, I can confirm. And I? How did you find me? You stammer less than usual, you made a good impression on me. Sorry, they're calling me. (CELL PHONE) Here ... Wait ... No, it's David, I have to answer, I'm sorry. - No, wait. - Yes, but I have to answer. - Yes, David. Arrival, I was at ... - Valérie? - Ok, a second. - Hello? - I'll call you. - OK. Yes, David? (INCOMPRESSIBLE WORDS BY DAVID) Such as?! It is not possible! It won't be true ... No I do not understand. No, listen ... The police ?! No, let's not talk about these things over the phone. Arrival. (MUSIC OF "LATE FOR MY FUNERAL" BY MIKE STINSON) Seriously?! What comes to mind? Between you and me ... it is not the first time. - You should have told me. - I won't tell you not everything. - Is there anything worse? - No. - Anyway, it will stay between me and the police. - It's not like that, everything comes to light! - You are a politician, you must be transparent. - Nude in the middle of the street? - It is not the same thing to be naked or exemplary. - Exemplary? Don't make me the moral. Instead yes! Politicians pass life to do morality to others. - The same thing for me. - Jack Daniels with ice. - Yes, that's what I need. - Public morality, social morality, but private life is different. - No, it's the same! - What two consenting adults do concerns the voters? - Hiding something makes you suspicious. - Do you find it normal? - It doesn't matter what I think, it's the public opinion that counts. They are the same ones that just revolt do they touch their personal data? They have not chosen politics. - And I who dedicate myself to the public good ... - Wait, stop! Nobody thinks that you dedicate yourself to the public good. They are convinced that you are doing politics to satisfy your ego or to enrich yourself. - But it's false! - Yes, but this is the perception they have. You must be flawless, above suspicion. Impeccable means heterosexual, monogamous, that the Sunday lunch with the happy little family? I'm not telling you this. And then many politicians they claim to be homosexual and do nothing. - You say that. - Instead you shouldn't get arrested while leaving a prostitute's camper. It is an unacceptable thing, which gives an image regrettable of you. At least don't get caught! - Easier said that done. - I remind you that it is a crime subject to sanction. - 350 euros. - Oh ... (SIGLA DALLA TV) (TV) Welcome back. The debate continues ... (DOOR OPENING AND CLOSING) (TV) - Good evening. - Good evening. - An authoritative voice has reached us ... - Everything good? - For nothing. I saw David ... He made me despair. Why? - I can not say it. It made me despair. - You can't say one thing in half. It made me despair, period. I will not say why. - However... - Don't insist, please stop it. Ok. - Would you like something to drink? - No thanks, I drank too much. I have to tell you something. No one forces you. - Don't you want to know? - Yes. Just that sometimes there are things that it is better not to say. - Yes, but not in a couple. - Especially in a couple. Believe in concealment and ... in hypocrisy? - Well, yes, I believe it. - Yup? In reality this is not the case. I believe in the implicit. - The implicit. - You know, I know, no need to get bogged down. - It's a strange philosophy. - Well ... I don't know. Because, you think it's better suffer when you can avoid it? Listen ... I have a ... a ... a story ... outside of our relationship. Here it is. IS? - Anything. I have a story. - But I know that. Your book is not about anything else. It is a fictional autobiography, indeed, it is indeed a novel. Really? I would not have said it. Instead it's just like that. - And you thought you didn't suspect it? - No, you never said anything. - What's up? - I can not believe it. But come on, it's not possible. - Such as? Nothing forget it. - Is it with Stephanie Volkowski? - No, it's not with Stephanie Volkowski. - With whom then? - Do you see that the implicit has limits? Someone I know? IS'... - It's Selena. - Selena ?! - Selena Selena? - Yes. we don't know so many Selena. Therefore not... - I never would have said. - Anyway, it's over. - Why should I believe you? - I told you because I want to restore trust between us. - Telling me your stories. - Stopping to lie. - Just lie to me. The truth you tell everyone in the books. - Yes, but through a curtain of smoke. - Forgive me, but your curtain is thin. - But it confuses the tracks. You also thought it was Stephanie Volkowski. Look ... I mean, do you realize? Do you listen to yourself? It does not make sense! What difference do you want me to make? Certain things are not written if you have not lived them. Who believes it? Yes I know. Anyhow, nothing changes if it's Stephanie or Selena. Change that at least I told you. (MUSIC OF "GOPURU" BY GURRUMUL) I've already come. It is on the right. Here, on the right. (MUSIC OF "GOPURU" BY GURRUMUL) - I'm there. - (Valérie) The sea is in front of us? I lost my orientation. No, it's behind the trees. (MUSIC OF "GOPURU" BY GURRUMUL) - (Valérie) Hi there! - It's us! - Hello. I didn't hear you coming. - How are you, Alain? - Welcome. - Thank you. Here we are. - Hello. How are you? - Well. - Hi, Selena. - Hello, "Valéria", how are you - "Valerie". - Sorry, I'm always wrong. - You never remember. It's funny! - How are you? - Well. - I'm glad to see you. - It's been a long time for me too. - You are right! It doesn't seem like a long time and instead ... - It is so, the years fly in a moment. You had trouble finding the way to get here? No not at all. Also because Leonard he had already been there and remembered the street. - Yes I've been there. Once ... long ago. - I do not remember. - Maybe you weren't there. - And where was I? - Boh! You were in Japan, I think. I do not know. - It wasn't that long ago. - No ... - Ah, well, no, maybe not. Then... Come! - It's good to see each other here. - Yup. - Where can I support this? - Make yourself at home. Here it is. - Well done for you, right? - Yes, well done, thanks. - Ah, not too much. - Thank you. - Lemon? - Yes maybe. - It looks very good. - I'll put it here, sorry. - Imagine. - Here. - Wow! Thanks a lot! - Sorry, yes, it's a bit ... - It's fine. Thank you. - Don't you want fish? - No thanks, I finish the peppers first. - Do you know that I don't miss an episode of "Collusion"? - I can't take it anymore, I'm sick of it. - I refused the fourth season. - And how they do it in these cases? - They kill the character. - Will they kill you? - Yes. - And how? She has a husband who can't stand her ... He will kill her and will melt the body in an acid tank. - No! - No, I don't know anything! Just kidding. It's a beautiful series, however, very compelling. Do not you think that there are too many cops on TV? She is not a policewoman. She is an expert on crisis situations. - She's a cop. A policewoman! - Yes, but I'm passionate about it. Now you can no longer experiment something except as an addiction. It seems a bit exaggerated, I did not mean that. No, I wouldn't say so which I am dependent on the series. But yes, instead you're right, the series is like that. They lead you to a compulsive vision. - It actually relaxes me. - Sorry, I don't have it with you. - But I don't do this job to relax people. - No but... - You're wrong, many think so. - I'm not sure. - There is a great demand for literature escapist. - Even relaxing music? Sure. Get coloring books for adults. Don't make that face. We also publish them and sell a lot. Sorry, I didn't understand correctly. Coloring books for adults? Yes. Come back from work, relax, discharge stress ... - Still wine? - (Valérie) Yes, thank you. - Here's to you. - Nothing more, thank you. - And you download coloring what? Coloring plant motifs, mandalas ... - You distract yourself. - But, excuse me, is it widespread? It is a social phenomenon. It should be listened to. What bitterness. In conclusion, I feel completely incompetent in this. You know, there is evasion literature. It is a fact. My books are the opposite. The reader is even worse off. There are those who write "feel-good-books". I would say that I write ... of the "feel-bad-books". There is also an audience for those. The desserts go with the coffee, I guess. Do I put them here? - Do you want a hand? - No, no, I can do it. So, Selena, what are your plans at the moment? "Fedra" ... at the theater. - He's with a young Belgian director. - Wow! "Fedra"! - Do you want to interpret it? - Yes, I know it's an old woman's role. - No. - Yes, yes. When they propose you Fedra is usually the beginning of the end. Dominique Blanc made it, directed by Chereau. At first I thought that not I would have done it even under torture. Then I told myself that it was still a nice text. It would have been stupid to miss it. - Especially for the wrong reasons. - Yeah. I also searched on Wikipedia ... Sarah Bernhardt has interpreted it at 30 years. So, well, why not? - You took a look at the e-book of your book? - Why, does it exist? - Sure. - It's not going wrong. - Not bad... Not bad for being contemporary literature. - Do you want a coffee? - Yes thanks. Even sugar, thanks. Thank you. What do you mean exactly? Well, you know, what works best in e-books ... .. especially thrillers and the pink novels, Nora Roberts style. - Who, Nora Roberts ?! - Yes. - Who is Nora Roberts? It has only sold more than 100 million of books and is translated into 26 languages. - Ah, sorry. - Objectively, it is rather cheap literature. - So why do you sell too many e-books? - It mainly depends on the price. For example, there is "End Point" which costs 13.99 euros ... ..and then there's Nora Roberts which is sold for 3.99 euros. - It's essentially this. - Clear. By chance you are thinking of doing an audiobook of "Punto finale"? Yes, I'm thinking, since sales are quite good. - But it will cost to make an audiobook. - Yes, right. - We proposed it to Juliette Binoche. - Really? - Yup. - Do you think he will accept? - I do not know. He hasn't replied yet. - Selena contacted you. - Maybe I could write you a few lines. - I mean, if you ... - Eh? - If you have his mail ... No, it's reserved. If you want, I can give you the number of his agent. All right. Just to motivate it. Over there, see? That whole area is pristine. Coming I was paying attention, it's lucky for you. Who knows how long it will last. I've read your name in the newspapers lately. - What newspapers? - On the "Investing" website. - Do you have a Google alert for my name? - Why? - Do you usually read "Investing"? No, but there are persistent rumors about the fact that Marc-Antoine Rouvel wants to sell. - It is no longer topical. - And you're about to leave. - They are "fake news". Why are you interested? - Yes, I'm interested enough. - He had to sell to Dehoux, or to the Dehoux group. - Dehoux. - He is a disreputable character. - I agree with you. But it was all a lie. Dehoux was trying to close a great acquisition, ... .. an Italian information site who wanted to launch a French edition. The Vertheuil Editions they were just a diversion. Follow me? Honestly it seems to me quite smoky, but I understood the general idea. In short, he made fun of Marc-Antoine, never wanted to buy. He wanted the market to think he would bought and in the meantime he concluded the deal. - So he keeps you. - Yes, he keeps me. In short, it no longer sells. Are you working on something? - I don't feel like talking about it much. - But are you going? - Yes, go ahead, very well. - Don't you want to tell me anything else? - No. - No. - Careful! - We are! We're back! - Hey, champion! - Pope! - How are you? Did you have fun? - Yes. - What did you do? - Martin! - Did you take a bath? - No, bye! It went well? - Look what I found! - But they are so many! - How many do you have Do we put them in a dish? - Do you know what's there now? - No, the nap no! - Then you want to eat a fish! - A huge fish is waiting for you! - I eat fish too! I got one! Leave me, dad! (INDISTINTO DIALOGUE) Yes, I have to go out early enough. - What's up? - Nothing, it's to thank you. - About what? - You were rather diplomatic. Diplomatic with respect to what? I prefer Selena not to know me I'm back to writing. I was afraid you would run away. - Selena doesn't know what's in your book? - No, but it is a sort of fictional autobiography ... - It's Selena but it's not Selena. - Leonard, you're going to be in trouble. Yes, but I'm unable to write anything else. I really can't. I can not do it. There is one thing I wanted to tell you. I kept it from you. - Do you have a story? - But no! - Is there another? - No! I don't know then. - I'm pregnant. - Pregnant ...? -Pregnant. No, because actually I was thinking ... - The gynecologist had said that not we are compatible. -Instead it seems so. - But you checked that everything goes ... - Yes, I did ultrasounds, samples. - He's fine, it's normal. - "He"? You said "he". - Is he a boy? - No. - Yes, you know. - I asked not to know. I do not want to. Seriously, I don't want to. - How long? - Three months. - Three months? - I wanted to be sure before I told you about it. Well, actually we don't have a very active sex life. - No, in recent times no. - No, I'd say nothing crazy. - No not much. But just once. When we tried procreation assisted did not work. - That's like the lottery. - Yes, but it is however, a lottery that did not work. - Yes, so ... - Yes, it's true. - So it's a miracle. No, the miracle is something that does not exist. This is real. Yes, it's real. You are happy? Well, I feel obliged to do this to answer honestly. Yup. - Wait, I'm sorry ... But the baby is it more here or here? Or in the middle? - It's more... I don't know, I think here, more or less. But it's still very small. - Small how much? - It will be the size of a lentil. - A lentil even? Or a bean? - (Valérie) It's like a bean.
