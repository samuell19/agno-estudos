(dramatic intro music) (electric static buzzing) (ominous music) [Narrator] Bachelor's degree, four years. Masters, two years. Doctorate, three to six, with good behavior. That's the starting point if you want to be an English professor. After all that time spent, what I really wanted was the ultimate reward. Tenure. (choir music) Tenure is much more than the joy of teaching wide eyed students. Tenure allows you freedom to pursue any intellectual endeavor. Tenure means you never have to worry about being judged by self-righteous douche bags ever again. But the number one benefit, once you're tenured, it's near impossible to lose your job. Unless you do something really fucking stupid. (door creaking open) (door hitting ground) Lie back down. Classes don't start for two weeks. Lay down. I have a meeting with the dean, also meeting some of my new colleagues. Lovely. Don't get into any fights. No promises. Whatcha working on? I'm making a nose ring. What? Why? Because I think they're cool. (sipping drink) Hmm. Stop that. You're gonna hurt yourself. Why are you wearing a tie? It's my first day of work. I wanna make a good impression. We'll hang out later tonight. Okay? I got to run. (lips kissing ) Bye, Daddy. I hope you get 10 years. It's tenure. Nevermind. I'll see you later, Peanut. (somber music) ♪ It's not the future ♪ ♪ Or death I fear ♪ ♪ It's what we've grown ♪ ♪ Our past might disappear ♪ ♪ Somewhere behind blue skies ♪ ♪ Great, black empty eyes ♪ ♪ Are watching me ♪ ♪ Watching you ♪ ♪ As you walk away ♪ ♪ As you walk away ♪ (music fades) No, he doesn't look anything like my father. Besides, I don't care about that, he's charming. Oh, I'm gonna call you back. Yeah, I'll call you later. Bye. Hi, you must be Dr. Bowden. I'm Emily. Welcome to Sayles College. Thank you. It's a pleasure. Likewise. The dean will be with you in just a moment if you wanna take a seat. Okay. (sanitizer bottle pumping) (hands rubbing together) (leather seat softly squeaking) (electric motors whirring) (finger pressing switch) (phone ringing) Yes. Okay. I'll send him right in. Okay. (phone clunking down) The dean's ready for you if you wanna head right in. Thanks. [Emily] Yep. Enjoy. [Dean Crawley] Dr. Bowden. Dean Crawley. Please, have a seat. Thank you. So how can I help you? Well, I think I'm ready for my classes. (laughing) Are there any guidelines? Documents for tenure? Tenure. The big 'T'. (laughing) I get it. And yes, there are. Emily can email those to you. Great. I just want to be sure I am doing all the right things. Jim, I can call you Jim, yes? Of course. You should know. I'm not a big fan of tenure. I believe it's an antiquated concept. But my position, it's a tenure track appointment. Oh, it is. It is. But my advice? Don't focus so much on that. Use your probationary time to, well, just do good work. Probation? Do I get an ankle bracelet? (laughing) It's nothing to worry about. Probation's a good thing. Think of it as seven years to write, research, it's a gift of time. Sure. You see my issue is with some professors, they get tenure and they, well they stop doing much of anything. Hell, some of them barely teach their classes. Yeah, I've seen some of that, but that won't be me. Oh, of course not. But it's because of those folks that you'll face a fair bit of scrutiny. Besides, there's no shortage of English professors. (laughing) Oh, do you shoot? Me? No. I've never even fired a gun. Hmm. You play racketball? No, but it sounds fun. Uh huh. So what are you writing these days? Actually, I'm writing a novel. Fiction? Hmm. Is that bad? Oh, of course not. Anyway, in seven years, you will submit a dossier. Documenting your work from this day forward, at which time you will defend your worth. My worth? Your worth, Jim. Are you worthy? (laughing) Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse Five is about? Time travel. Come on. (chilled music) ♪ Seems to me to be ♪ ♪ A great many years ♪ ♪ Since you disappeared ♪ ♪ Is this a fleeting ♪ ♪ Momentary meeting ♪ ♪ I don't need ♪ ♪ Time or reason ♪ ♪ All life is illusion ♪ (instrumental building) (music ending) (fingers tapping keyboard keys) Fucking piece of shit. Print the last fucking page. (paper rustling) (printer printing) (printer printing) Ahhh. (paper stack hitting desk) Are you worthy, Jim? Doubtful. I can't even operate a fucking printer. Yeah. You might as well quit now. Ha, ha. Funny. (paper rustling) (paper rustling) You get all these professors evaluating other professors, the knives come out. You think they'll ignore all that? Allison, stop. You're not the first English professor to come up for tenure. Yeah. Remember Martin? He came up last year and was denied. Martin was a tool. Everyone hated him. Yeah. Now he's a barista paying off his student loans. One latte at a time. Can he make pictures of birds in the foam? I love it when they do that. Knowing Martin. Probably just pictures of himself. [Allison] Ooh. My life is in their hands. Such melodrama. What are you doing? What's on your agenda for today, Allison? Thanks for asking, sweetheart. I'm sorry. What's your day like? I got a new client. Hmm. Really. A sweet boy, Vincent. Yeah. That's good. It is. (paper rustling) Here for good luck. (soft music) (paper rustling) (softly laughing) [Jim] Mmm. (lips kissing) Mmm. Uh.. Later? Always later. (lips kissing) (lips kissing air) Send my love to the committee. (somber music) (footsteps walking) (car alarm disarming) (door opening) (door closing) (engine revving) (music continues) (indistinct chattering) [Amy] Dad. Hey. Going to class? Yep. You really think they're gonna read all that? Hard to say. And why are you carrying it around? I can't leave it in my car. What if someone steals it? I can't think of a safer place than your car. Oh. You're a college student. You know you're all a bunch of cars thieves. True. Got a shoot today? Yes. We are shooting a scene from my film. We? You mean you and Alex? Yes and other students from class. You going to be parading around naked again? No. I'm not acting this time. I'm DP. And that was allegorical imagery. I see. And here I thought it was gratuitous nudity. Dad, it's not a big deal. Maybe not to you. That was three therapy sessions for me. Could be worse. [Alex] Hey, Amy. Here comes the pornographer now. Hey. Hey. Hi, Dr. 'Bo-den'. It's 'Bowden' Alex. Hi... now this is where I part. I'll see you later. I'll be late. See you, Dad. Be safe. I don't think your dad likes me. He doesn't. What? Think you might wanna help me carry any of this. Really? (soft music) (phone ringing) Jim Bowden. [Emily] Dr. Bowden. It's Emily, from the Dean's office. Hi Emily. [Emily] The committee is meeting today at nine thirty and they still have not received your materials. Uh huh, I have them all right here. My class ends at nine thirty. I'll see about ending a little early to drop them off. [Emily] Well, the dean won't like that. What? Ending class early or arriving after nine thirty? [Emily] Both. I'll get there as soon as I can. [Emily] Okay. See ya. [Mia] Professor. Oh, Jesus Christ. You can't just walk in like that. Sorry. I was hoping to catch you before class. Class is starting now. I know the paper is due today and I was hoping to get an extension. What's your name again? Mia. Mia Pierce. Okay. Mia Pierce. Deadlines are deadlines? We all have them. I just need one day. It wouldn't be fair to the students who hand theirs in on time. Isn't there anything that I can do? Anything? This is really heavy. (door opening) I'm standing right here. Get over yourself. [Jim Bowden] Good morning. Francis. Andrew. (folder landing on lectern) Why are you being like this? Being like what? Like this. (clock ticking) - That's it for today. - (folder snapping shut) Please leave your papers if you have not yet uploaded them. Dr. Bowden, do you have time for a one on one chat? Sorry, I'm in a rush. Email me or (papers rustling) something. (footsteps marching) (car alarm disarming) (car door opening) (car door closing) (car door opening) (heavy breathing) (door closing) (keys jangling) (engine starting) (music blaring) (music stopping) (tires screeching) (body hitting car) (groaning) What the fuck was that? (engine revving) (tires bumping over body) (groaning) What the fuck was that? (gear shifter shifting) (handbrake wrenching) (door opening) Oh, God. No. No, no. Derek? (ominous music building) Oh, fuck me! Oh, not now. Derek, please wake up. I haven't got time for this. Someone, please help! (phone beeping) (phone ringing) Dean Crawley. I'm on my way to you right now. [Dean Crawley] What is your ETA? I'll be there in about 10 minutes. [Dean Crawley] The committee is here. Waiting. Yeah. Okay. I'll see you soon. (ominous music building) (trunk door opening) (body dragging on floor) (Jim groaning) Get... up... (Jim groaning) Oh, fuck. (door opening) (heavy breathing) (Jim groaning) (heavy breathing) (heavier groaning) (panting) (ominous music continues) (door closing) Hang in there, Derek. I'm gonna get you to the hospital. (trunk closing) Just one quick stop. (engine revving) (Derek groaning) What were you doing behind me. Derek? Shit. He'll be okay. (tires skidding) (door opening/closing) (door opening/closing) (hands lifting box) (Jim groaning) (footsteps running) Hold that. Hold that please. Here it is. Erm, you can take this right up to the eighth floor conference room. Can I just leave it here? I'm sort of in a hurry. Mm. I can't leave my desk. So unfortunately, no. Okay. Sure. (heavy breathing) (button clicking) (elevator beeping) (door sliding open) Hi, can you push eight for me? (feet scurrying) Jesus. [Elevator Speaker] Second floor. Third floor. Fuck. (elevator beeping) (doors sliding open) They sent a fax. Can you believe that? (laughing) What's a fax? Right? Hold the door, Maggie's coming. [Maggie] Oh, thanks. Oh, damn it. I meant to push six, I'm sorry. - (laughing) - It's OK. (door sliding closed) [Elevator Speaker] Fourth floor. (doors sliding open) Excuse me. (footsteps walking away) (doors sliding closed) [Elevator Speaker] Fifth floor. (doors sliding open) (doors sliding closed) Sixth floor. (doors sliding open) Have a good day. (heavy breathing) Hang in there, Derek. (doors sliding closed) (elevator sounds) [Elevator Speaker] Eighth floor. (doors sliding open) (footsteps running) (dramatic music) (door opening) I am so sorry for the delay. (box landing on table) I just got out of class. Here it is. Do you know the meaning of a deadline? I most certainly do. And today is the deadline. Actually, it was yesterday and we gave you an extension for today at 9:30 AM. It's 9:45. I understand, but my class didn't end until 9:30. I ran over... here... as quick as I could. It's fine. But we have to get started with the review, so... Oh, okay. Sure. Any idea when I'll hear? It'll be a few months. Months? Of course. Sure. Months. (Laughing) Jim, we understand how distressing this can be. But please know we do not take this lightly. Now, if you will excuse us. Of course. Sure. I appreciate all that you're doing for all of us at the college. The students, the faculty. I'll leave you to it. (Nervously laughing) (door opening) (sighing) Derek. (dramatic music) (heavy breathing) (footsteps running) Oh, God. Oh, God. (car door opening/closing) (engine revving) (tires screeching) (trunk door opening) Derek. Oh, God. (heavy breathing) Fuck me!! Why today, of all days? I don't deserve this! I'm a published fucking novelist! Ow! (fist punching brick wall) (screaming) Ow! (trunk door closing) (door closing) (ominous music) I just killed a person. I killed, Derek. I'm a murderer. (torch tapping on glass) You can't park here. (electric window going down) You can't park here. I just dropped off my tenure dossier. I don't know what that means. Move your vehicle. Sorry. (electric window going up) (ominous music) (car turn signal clicking) What, you have to think about it? Ahhhhh... What's the point? You're dead. Are you sure? Yes... I'm pretty sure. So, you're not even going to try to save me? It's too late. I'm sorry. What a dick. You have no idea what sort of pressure I've been going through. (engine revving) (quiet dramatic music) (door opening) (keys jangling) (door closing) (car alarm activating/beeping) (footsteps running) Ah, shit. (shovels clanging together) (shovels clanging together) Dr. Bowden? Oh, hey. It's Alex. Yes, I know who you are, Alex. Buying a shovel? Yes, I am. A little gardening. Cool. It's weird seeing you at a hardware store. Why is that? I don't know. I guess I just didn't expect it. Uhh. I'm buying these light bulbs for the shoot. You know, they say these LED ones last a lot longer than these halogen ones, but I don't know. They seem to die just as quick as the other ones. These LED ones do cost a lot more, but they don't get as hot. So, which ones do you use? I think the LED ones. Should have known. (Laughing) Well, I should... Oh yeah, yeah. No. Yeah. I got to get these back to Amy anyway. So, (footsteps stumbling) see ya. (shovels clanging together) (shovel landing on countertop) - (scanner beeping) - $33.51. You know what, let me pay cash. [Cashier] Whatever. This is a nice shovel. It's a fiberglass handle. It's basically indestructible. It's a good price too. I'll cherish it. (metal clanging) (change jingling/rustling) Can I get a bag? It's a shovel. Have a nice day. (footsteps marching) (ominous music) Fucking, Alex. [Lisa] You are such a good boy. Yes, you are, Vincent. You are such a good boy. (baby talk) He is good. Most dogs don't sit still for this long. Yes. He is a special boy, aren't you? You are so special and so smart. (lips kissing) Mm, yes you are. Aww. I would've thought your studio space would've been bigger. I make do. Oh, no. I love what you've done with it. Yeah, it's great. You know I'm a realtor, don't you? I didn't. Well, I am. And a new listing just came on the market. Lots more light. This is a rental, right? Yes. Have you ever thought about owning? We have, but we're waiting to see what happens with my husband's tenure. [Lisa] Oh, he's a professor? - He is. - Oh. English literature. That is so nice for him. A lot of my clients work there. So many pretty college girls romping around. I'm sure he loves it there. My daughter goes there... for her education, not to romp around. Oh, no, no. I didn't mean anything by it. I just meant it's so nice to have all those young people in town. And it's co-ed. There are boys there too. [Lisa] Yes, I know. I think I got what I needed. (ominous music) (ominous music building) (engine running) (tires rolling on snow) (engine turning off) [Jim] Oh. Oh God. Oh God. (birds chirping) Oh... Oh God. (feet dragging on ground) (heavy breathing) Job security. Academic freedom. A life of the mind. Oh, fuck he's heavy. (heavy breathing) (groaning) You know, this is called involuntary manslaughter. Looking at 12 years minimum. 10, for good behavior. I've worked too hard to forfeit my career. My family. Your family. What about my family? What about my life? You're such a cunt. (shovel hitting hard ground) Ahhh! Mother fucker! (shovel slicing through ground) (soil dropping on ground) (shovel digging into soil) (dirt falling to the ground) (shovel hitting hard ground) (shovel handle snapping) (groaning) (screaming) (heavy breathing) (grunting) (handle hitting ground) (groaning) (shovel digging into soil) (soil landing on ground) (groaning) (shovel hitting ground) (grunting) (body dragging on soil) (grunting) (body falling onto ground) (grunting) (heavy breathing) (metal shovel dinging on ground) (shovel digging soil) (soil landing on body) (rucksack landing in grave) (shovel scraping up soil) (shovel dropping in grave) Derek, I am truly sorry. You didn't deserve this. Even if you were kind of irritating. (footsteps walking/rustling) (heavy breathing) Shit. (foot dragging on snow) (heavy breathing) Oh fuck. (shovel landing in trunk) (trunk door closing) (door opening/closing) (ominous music) [Store Announcer] Attention Last Chance shoppers. Today is senior Tuesday.

Thank you for shopping at Last Chance donation center. Where the customer is always our first priority. (trash bag rustling) (door opening) (ominous music building) (door closing) [Allison] Congratulations. For what? For handing in your dossier. Dossier? What are you, a secret agent? [Allison] That's what they call it. Of course they do. (Jim gulping drink) (gulping continuing) (heavy sigh) Well, you can relax now. It's out of your hands. Man, you're ripe. Uhh... yeah. (water running) (Jim gulping drink) (heavy sigh) Where did you get that shirt? Oh, this? I borrowed it. I spilled coffee all over mine. I'm going to take a shower. Borrowed? From who, Jimmy Buffet? I think dad is high. He's freaking out about tenure. [Amy] You should tell him about that house you want to buy. [Allison] I'm just looking. [Amy] Sure. Who would want to leave this palace? (ominous music) (door closing) (sighing) (deep breathing) (ominous music) (water running) (feet slipping / body hitting floor) [Jim] FUCK!! Maybe he is high. (car engine revving) (car engine turning off) (handbrake wrenching) (socket wrench ratcheting) [Jim] Hi. Do you work here? Uh... what do you think? Uh yeah. I'm looking for some wheels for my car. That car? [Jim] Yes. It looks like it already has wheels. I just want some backups, just in case. Have a look around. Well, what about those wheels? - (laughing) - Those wheels will not fit your car. Well, can you help me? (sighing) (metal clanging) Any idea where I should look? Come back when you found what you want and we will set it up. (socket wrench ratcheting) Yeah. Okay. (light music) (grunting) (groaning) (head hitting car) Ow. Fuck. (wheel rolling on ground) (metal clanging) How much do I owe you? 50 bucks. (cash rustling) It's been a pleasure. Uh huh. Fucking douche bag. (finger tapping keyboard key) (phone ringing) This is Jim Bowden. Jim, it's Dean Crawley. Can you come by my office? Oh, Dick, hey. [Dean Crawley] It's Dean Crawley. What? My name? It's D-Nevermind. Can you come by my office. When? [Dean Crawley] Uh, 11 o'clock. I'm kind of busy. Wait, is it about tenure? [Dean Crawley] What? No. I got a call from the mother of one of your students. Mother. Who's mother? [Dean Crawley] I'd prefer to talk about it in person. (sigh) I hate talking to mothers. Is she gonna be there? What? No. Good. Nag, nag, nag. Am I right? What is wrong with you? Oh, Dick. I really don't want to go into it. Look, whatever. Just come by my office at 11 o'clock. Mother, 11 o'clock. Got it. (phone hanging up) (door opening) (laughing) [Emily] Now beg for me you dirty bitch. That's right, you get in your corner. You sit there. You think about what you've done. Hello? [Emily] I think someone's coming. (Indistinct) (door opening) (footsteps walking) Dr. Bowden? The dean is just finishing up a phone call. Be with you in just a moment. You can have a seat, if you want. Sure. [Emily]. Mmm hmm. I'm early. Indeed. (sigh) (sign sliding on desk) (sanitizer bottle falling on desk) (electric table adjusting/whirring) (phone ringing) Yes? Yes. Yes. I think so. Okay. Okay. The Dean will see you now. You can go right in. (footsteps walking away) (door opening) Have a seat. I received a call from the mother of Mia Pierce. Mia. She's in my Tuesday, Thursday English lit class. [Dean Crawley] She is. She wears mini skirts in winter. Her mother claims you've been having a relationship with her daughter. What? No. That is not happening. She went on to say that when Mia tried to break it off, you suggested how that might impact her grade. That's a lie. She cornered me and was asking for an extension. I told her no. So you're not having a relationship with her? Absolutely not. I really hate these sort of things, Jim. Mia has done practically zero work in my class. Not to mention she's a manipulative little (deep breathing) Dean Crawley, I'm a married man. (chortles) The tenure committee found this mixed in with your materials. My wife gave that to me. Between the Pierce accusation and that (laughing) you've put me in an uncomfortable position. Oh, you're uncomfortable? Well, I'm furious! Call my wife! She'll tell you she drew that. I'd like to hang on to that. Okay. Emily has a copy I'm sure. Emily knows about this? It's her job to know everything. She sure has a lot of responsibilities. Does the tenure committee know about Mia's accusation? I'm not at liberty to say. You don't believe it, do you? It doesn't matter what I believe. It looks bad. Huh. There's a lot of that going around. What do you mean? Things looking bad. I mean, what you do with your staff is your business. I'm not one to judge. If you have something to say, say it. I'm just saying, maybe we can back each other up. Mia accuses me... You and Emily. All right. This meeting's over. I'm just saying maybe we can be allies when perceptions are misconstrued. Leave - Dick. Think this through. Your wife doesn't need to know. Get out. All right. I'm going. Mia's lying. (door opening) (footsteps marching) My wife drew that picture. We also have a healthy sex life. (door opening hard) [Allison] Oh my gosh. [Lisa] Yeah. [Allison] Wow. (soft music) [Lisa] Here we go. [Allison] Thank you. [Lisa] You're welcome. Wow. Look at this. [Lisa] Yeah. Oh. I'd like to have my husband come see it. Oh, of course. All this woodwork is original. [Allison] Is it? - Yes. Isn't that amazing? - It is. They don't make them like this anymore. Seriously. I really didn't imagine it'd be this nice. Well, give him a call. Have him come take a look. [Allison] I'll see if he's free. (phone ringing) Hey. [Allison] I found it. Found what? Our new home. [Jim] What? It's perfect. Open, bright. Lots of space. I want you to come see it. My career is over, Allison. [Allison] What? The dean. He said a student accused me of some misconduct, which is not true. But then I said some things. It's probably not as bad as you think. No, no, I made it personal. I'm a fucking idiot. I'm finished. It's over. [Allison] Just relax. Come see this house and get your mind off it. We can figure it out together. House? No, I can't see a house. I have to talk some sense into him. - I got to go. - Wait. Take a breath. Jim? (Phone beeping) (door opening hard) [Emily] Dr. Bowden, you can't just barge in here. You're the dean. I'm a member of your faculty who has been falsely accused. Why are you not backing me up? You need to leave right now. I would never get involved with a student. Not at this point in my career. You should be on my side. Look, I'm sorry about my insinuations, but listen... No, no, you listen. Sometimes an institution is going one way and a faculty member is going another. What the fuck are you talking about? You're either on the train or you're not. What train? I have done everything expected of me. I'm a good teacher. I'm a published novelist. I even won an award. Here we go with the book again. Ah hah... AHHHH! There it is. Now I see. You don't like my book. This has nothing to do with your book. Too many 'fucks'? Bowden, enough. What? You know better than the reviewers. You're an art critic now? (laughing) Are these your photos? Yes. I took them. Well, they suck. (laughing) All I see are pictures of dirt. Dirt is worthy of hanging on your walls, but years of hard work and commitment, that you can dismiss with one false accusation. Okay, Emily, call security. If I had written about your insipid dirt photos, would that make me more 'tenureable'? The artist reflects on the human condition as we will all one day return to the earth. Would that have sealed the deal? This is not over. Oh, it's over. What are you doing? Bowden, that's mine. Get back here. Bowden. Give me back my photo! Bowden? Fuck him and his fucking dirt photos. (bodies colliding) (ominous music) Ever write a novel? Fucking asshole. [Detective Wilson] Dr. Bowden. Yes. I'm Detective Wilson. Detective? Can we talk? I've got a class soon. Oh, it won't take but a few minutes. Okay. (door opening) What do you think of this? I don't have any feelings one way or another. Right? It's crap. Would you hang this on your wall? Probably not. You've got a student in one of your classes. A Derek Mahoney. Erm, yes. Derrick. He's my student. Well, he's been reported missing. And the last time he was seen was in your class. Missing? That's disconcerting. Outside of my classes I don't often see my students. Well, do you recall when you saw him last? A few days ago, maybe? I don't take attendance. Okay. Can you tell me anything about him? Who his friends are? He has a girlfriend called Mia. Mia Pierce. How do you know she's his girlfriend? - I don't know. Body language. - Together outside of class. I thought you just said that you don't see your students outside of class. I meant off campus. I don't see them off campus. I guess I've seen them walking around together on campus here. You should talk to Mia. Yeah, we have. She was the one that told us that he was in your class. Well, I can tell you, he is not committed to English lit. A 'C' student at best. There is nothing here. It's vacuous. (Softly laughing) Is that one of your students' or something? Would you believe it's the deans? He gave it to me hoping I'd write a critique. But I gotta say, I'm at a loss. It's just dirt. Derek. Uh, yeah. I wish I had something else for you. I do hope he's okay. Well if you see him around or if you think of anything. Can you give me a call? Of course. (chair sliding on floor) (door opening) It's not art. (pen tapping on note book) That conniving little bitch. What's her name? Mia Pierce. Mia. It's not true, is it? Seriously, you're asking me that? It's just that I was your student, granted a grad student. No, it's not true. (door creaking open) Fucking Alex. Maybe she misinterpreted something you said. She wanted an extension on a paper. I didn't say anything. Who does that? Mia Pierce apparently. And you drew that picture. I did. My career is over. Apologize. And return his dirt thingy. Yeah. There's no point. I'm fucked. Hi. What's shaking? Dad's tenure stressing again. Oh geez. Do you wanna go out to eat? Hey, don't treat me like I'm a problem child. I'm being blackballed. Do you know Mia Pierce? No. Why? She's accusing dad of sexual misconduct. No one used those words. Oh, my God. Did you? Why does everyone keep asking me that? No. [Amy] Well, what are you gonna do? We'll probably have to move again. Can we move back to New York? You know, that could work for me. What? I thought you liked it here? It was always about your career, not mine. Yeah. But you agreed it was a good idea. At the time. It turns out taking pictures of pets is not my end-all. Everything I am doing, I am doing for you and for Amy. (laughing) If you say so. That's not fair. I know Mia. (snickering) Do tell. Ummm. I guess I kind of, sort of, used to see her. Oh, and why didn't I know about this? I mean, it was before you and I were even together. Is she pretty? Why should that matter? Sure. I guess. She's a terrible person. Wouldn't you say? I mean, I don't know about that. But she is a bit self-absorbed though. What we need is a lawyer. So how did you two meet? At one of your stupid frat parties? No, it was an audition. [Amy] So that's how your auditions go. What do you mean? [Amy] What do you mean? What sort of lawyer deals with sexual harassment? It's not sexual harassment. It's called conflict of interest. And I didn't do that either. Hey, did Amy tell you that our film was going to be screening at the Sayles film festival? That's wonderful. A new one? Or the one featuring Amy's boobs? Here we go. I mean, that's just one shot. It's hardly the film's substance. (laughing) Substance. I like that film. Mm. Now even more people get to see our daughters tits. They are nice tits. You know, maybe I should give that film another look. Okay, now you're starting to creep me out. What? I'll be objective. I will. I'll fast forward that part. You can't fast forward. It's important to the film. Well, maybe I was being too harsh. Boobs and all. Will you stop saying boobs? Maybe I can use it in my class for our module on short fiction. Wouldn't it need a story for your class? Hmm. Good point. Hey, there's a story. No, there isn't. It's a concept at best. Agreed. Can you send me the link? (clicking fingers) Right on. (laptop closing) - I found some numbers. - I'll call in the morning. (soft music) Your eyes shine bright like a star in the sky. (groaning) You... are a strong, powerful, woman of substance. And you are a small, meaningless man. (screaming) Oh God. [Alex] You are a strong, powerful woman. [Jim] Jesus. [Amy] First we are born, then we are entered into the system. Stop. (Music stopping) (finger tapping keyboard) (music playing in reverse) (music stopping) Screenshot... (camera shutter) Still. (fingers typing on keys) (computer mouse clicking) (fingers typing on keys) Stress. (message sending tone) (receiving message tone) (sighing) Fucking Emily. (fingers typing on keys) (message sending tone) (receiving message tone) I ran him over. (fingers typing on keys) (message sending tone) (receiving message tone) Adversarial relationship? Fuck you. (Laptop closing) (ominous music) I've been thinking a lot about commitment. (echoing footsteps) Commitment to family, school, to your employer. To your fellow human. To a career. You're young, hopeful. Your future awaits. But at some point soon you are going to commit to a path. And when you get far enough down that path, it will be impossible to choose a different path because that will now be who you are. A doctor, a lawyer, a fucking dean. Yes? Is this gonna be on the test? You know what? Never mind. (laughing) Go about your day. (papers rustling) (rucksacks zipping closed) (chairs sliding on floor) (footsteps walking away) Could I speak to you? (door latch closing) You told your mother that we were having a relationship? What are you talking about? And that I was holding your grade over you. Why would you do that? Would it have killed you to give me an extension? It's just a dumb English class. Do you understand the impact of your accusation? My job and my family. (breathing deeply) Mia, I'm married. How do you think that went over at my house? Not my problem. Is it? Wow, you're incorrigible. I don't know what that means, but I'm guessing it's not good. No, it's not good. (ominous music) I should have given you an extension. You should have. So what's our next move? Look, I'll give you an A in the class. You don't even have to come back. Just tell the truth. I'll think about it. Toodles. (ominous music continues) Gotcha (indistinct chattering) Okay. Okay, yeah. Yeah, do it. Do it, do it... do it. (camera shuttering) Oh, for fuck's sake. (sighing) Plan B.

Emily. Ah hah. Asshole. (thumb-drive sliding into computer) (ominous music) (fingers typing on keyboard keys) (indistinct muttering) Friend? Dear Amy, I loved your film. Stunning. (fingers typing on keyboard) This one. Keep up the good work. (computer mouse clicking) (heavy sigh) Please, forgive me. (message 'sending' tone) Adversaries. (incoming message tone) (computer mouse clicking) What the actual fucking fuck? (phone ringing) (phone ringing) Ah, that was fast. Hi, honey. What's up? Dad?, I'm freaking out. I don't know what to do. It's, (stuttering) I'm freaking out. It's Amy. Amy, calm down. I can't understand you. I got an email from Dean Crawley. One of those newsletter things? Not a newsletter thing. [Jim] Well, what then? He said a bunch of creepy shit and attached a picture of me topless from Alex's film. You're fucking kidding me. No way. Yes way. I don't know what to do. Fucking Alex. Alex is not the problem here. Okay. Forward me the email. I'll handle it. Well, are you going to show it to people? All of a sudden you're feeling shy? [Amy] Dad. Okay. Okay. Just email it. I'll be tactful. Promise? - (sighing) - I promise. Okay. I'm sending it now. Will you let me know what you're going to do? Well, we're getting a lawyer. That's what we're going to do. Okay. Take care. I'll see you soon. Okay. Love you. (ominous music building) (Echoing footsteps) (footsteps approaching) [Mia] Dr. Bowden. Oh fuck. Now what? Can I talk to you for a minute? You came to my house? Are we being photographed? I don't think so. I saw your wife leave earlier. She's pretty. And a stalker too. Lovely. I was thinking about what you said yesterday. Uh huh. I told my mom it was a misunderstanding. Good. Thank you. (metal tools clanging) I know it was shitty. But about that 'A' Did you mean it? (groaning/grunting) (tool hitting head) - (body hitting ground) - Mia. (screaming) Fuck. (car engine running) Incorrigible. A person not able to be corrected, improved, or reformed? Oh, the irony. All it took to improve your vocabulary was hitting you over the head with a lug-nut wrench. You're such a loser. And an insufferable douche bag to boot. I never meant for any of this to happen. I'm a good guy. [Derek & Mia] No, you're not. I bought this here and it broke the first time I used it. Bummer. You got a receipt? (shovel sliding on counter top) (paper rustling) Okay. Do you want a new one or do you want store credit? I want a new one. Isle 6. Maybe get one with a wooden handle this time. (sniggering) (shovels clanging together) (footsteps approaching) [clerk] Did you find everything you needed today? (engine revving) (ominous music) (heavy breathing) (feet dragging through leaves) (shovel digging into dirt) (ominous music building) (body dragging on soil) (body landing in grave) [Jim] Oh God. (footsteps staggering) [Mia] Are you checking me out? I am not checking you out. You're a corpse. Ew. Even worse. Fucking relentless. Perv. (footsteps walking away) (coyotes howl in the distance) (shovel digging into soil) (heavy breathing) (shovel landing in trunk) (trunk door closing) (grunting) Fuck me. (tires rolling on dirt) (distant party music playing) (mittens rustling) (distant indistinct chatting) Oh my God. Ho's be fucking crazy bro. (laughing) (indistinct chatting continues) ('Door open' alarm beeping) (door closing) (trunk opening) (rolling wheel on dirt) (footsteps scurrying) (dramatic music) (wheel rolling on dirt) (heavy breathing) [Jim] Two... (wheel banging on trunk floor) [Ji} ...three (grunting) Last one. Okay. Okay.

You scared the shit out of me. (distant dog barking) What are you doing? I'm sitting. In the dark like some serial murderer. (laughing) I spoke to the lawyer today. Have you ever changed a wheel? What? It's a lot harder than you'd imagine. The bolts are hard to take on and off. Did you not hear me? I spoke to the lawyer. Oh? She wants to meet with us. (sobbing) What the fuck, Jim? (sobbing) We're gonna need a lawyer. Yes. I just said, I spoke to the lawyer. Mia. She. She's nothing. The lawyer was not concerned about her. It's gonna be okay. Pull yourself together. (door creaking open) What's going on? Dad, why are you crying? Is this about the email? What email? He didn't tell you? Dean Crawley has been perving out on me because of Alex's film. What are you talking about? He said I was stunning. Forwarded a picture of myself, topless. I don't understand, the dean? Dad said we would get a lawyer. Is this what this is all about? Are you sure it's from Crawley? Let me see the email. This is too much. I'm calling the lawyer. She needs to hear about this. (whimpering) Dad. It's going to be okay. Amy, I'm sorry. It's not your fault. I've never seen you like this. Amy, listen. I gotta go see what mom is talking about. Amy. Alex, he's... Yeah, I know he's a pornographer. (ominous music) (fabric rustling) [Jim whispers] ...this guy... (car door opening/closing) (socket wrench ratcheting) Going to need some new wheels. Uh huh. For my wife's car. Uhhh (sighing) You know, talking to you is the best part of my day. (socket wrench ratcheting) (diploma frame thudding down) (frame sliding on wall) (knocking on door) Alex. Can I talk to you for a second? Sure. Have a seat. So I heard about the email. Well now you see that's exactly the sort of thing I was worried about. Yeah and I see that now. Look, the reason that shot was in the film was to show that her character had this strong, positive self image. And it kills me to think that that guy is out there wanking it, to it right now. Alex, what do you want? I just wanted to tell you that I cut the shot. I mean, it's gone. I think it's a little late, don't you? I suppose, but I mean it's not gonna screen that way from here on out. Hey, can you do me a favor? Sure. Yeah. Anything. Mia left that in class the other day. Can you return it to her? Aren't you gonna see her in class? No, she hasn't been in class. I guess she's sick. (sighing) Amy's not gonna like it. Oh. Well. Sure. I'm asking too much. No... I'll do it. [Jim] You will? What a relief. I am buried in grading here. No worries. (rucksack rustling) Again, I'm so, so sorry. Thank you, Alex. That means a lot. (footsteps walking away) What is this? Emily, come in here. [Emily] Be right there. Uh huh? [Dean Crawley] Come on. [Emily] Oh, okay. I'm coming. Do you see this? - (glasses hitting table) - I do. Why is it on my computer? Well, what sites have you been visiting? I'm not visiting any sites. An email was sent from my account with this image. Okay, well you maybe you were hacked. Oh, you think? Do you want me to call IT? Yes, call someone. No, you do not get to speak to me in that tone! You're right. I'm sorry. Forgive me. This is. You know what? Apology accepted. Okay. I'll see what I can do. Emily. [Emily] Minimize it. The photo? - [Emily] Yes. - Okay. (drill whirring) (drill whirring faster) (drill drilling/ratcheting) (wheel sliding off housings) (car engine running) (car engine turning off) (car door opening/closing) [Jim] (whispering) Fuck. [Detective Wilson] Dr. Bowden. Detective Wilson. Right? What brings you here? Well, Derek is still missing and now Mia Pierce has also been reported missing. Wow. What is going on? She was in my class on Thursday. - Thursday? - Uh huh. It's probably nothing, but her mother seems to think that it's unusual for her to not at least call. I couldn't say. They're probably on a little love getaway. You know, college kids. (laughing) I was one myself. (Laughing) Yeah. Hey, do you happen to know an Alex Delmonico? Yeah, That's my daughter's boyfriend. What can you tell me about him? Well, I can tell you he's a pornographer. Pornographer? Yeah. He made an obscene film. Calls it art. Sadly, my daughter's in it. [Detective Wilson] Oh. Yeah. It's really a self-indulgent piece of crap. Okay. Really terrible. You know, I think he used to date Mia. Well, I also heard that Mia is accusing you of a conflict of interest. That's a lie. In fact, I have a lawyer dealing with that as we speak. So you and Mia are not (laughing) Detective, I'm married. Second marriage, right? Yes. What of it? Nevermind. I'll be in touch. (footsteps approaching) Hi Jim. Have a seat. You're in my chair. Nice picture. You think? Looks like dirt to me. I know it was you. I was advised not to speak with you without my attorney being present. Oh, cut the shit. I know you sent the email. What? You think I sent my own daughter that picture? You, you deviant. Who else would have reason to send it? No one except an old pervert who has a thing for my daughter. You pretentious, little fuck. You think you can blackmail me to get tenure? Why would I need to blackmail you? I wrote a best selling novel. (laughing) Best selling. That book is garbage. Oh, I suppose it's not dirt. Full of obscenities and salacious dreck. (laughing) Oh, that's rich coming from the married guy who's fucking his secretary. Careful, Jim. My bad. Administrative assistant. What you did is a crime and just plain ugly. Your own daughter. You got it backwards. The dean of this institution harassing a student, my daughter, no less. You repulsive, elitist, cock knocker. (fist hitting face) (groaning) (body hitting ground) (groaning) You're finished, Bowden. Your career is over. (fist hitting face) (groaning) Oh, help me. Someone, please. (groaning) (heavy breathing) Oh. Thank God you came. That's Dean Crawley. It's not what it looks like. (groaning) Hey. Hey, that's my photo. (foot hitting body) (screaming) (groaning) [Student 1] Are you okay, professor? Oh. I'm fine. Thank you. (Groaning) Thank you. Can you believe that was my boss? Ugh. Ugh. Can you do me a favor? Can you notify campus security? [Student 2] Absolutely. No problem. (groaning) You should press charges. [Jim] Good idea. (door opening) (soft acoustic music) ♪ Must be the desert ♪ ♪ Playing tricks on my mind ♪ - [Professor Holly] - Also, a prolific writer. Good journals and a published book. You guys started without me? Dick, we have to ask you to leave. What? Why? We heard about the situation with Dr. Bowden. Oh, that's all under control. Bowden, it's complicated. You assaulted him. Does that sound like something I would do? Without good reason. Until the investigation is resolved, you are indefinitely suspended from your duties as dean. Suspended? What were you thinking? You can't suspend me. I'm the dean. (car door opening) (keys jangling) (car door closing) (trunk door opening) Hello? Let me guess, more wheels? It turns out I didn't use the second set. I'd like to return them. Ah. But I didn't even use them. Can't I just leave them here? Get them out of my car. How many? [Jim] Four. 60 bucks. What? I paid you 50. Recycling fee? 15 each. You're telling me I need to pay you to leave them with you? You can keep them. It does not matter to me. Fine. (cash rustling) Where should I put them? Would you put them on the north side? It's really gonna help improve the feng shui. This is like a front page headline. Crazed dean attacks professor. (chuckling) I can't believe he just came into your office and started punching you. I know. Insane, right? Did he say anything? He called my book salacious. Says the perv. His opinion no longer matters. He's done. A beautiful woman has replaced my little Peanut. I want you to know how proud I am of you. Both of you. I'm sorry to put you through all this. It's not your fault. This place sucks. Once this tenure business is behind us, things should settle down. (phone beeping) What the fuck? Now what? Alex. He's at the police station. What? Why? Something about Mia? What is it with that girl? (doorbell ringing) (door squeaking open) Good evening. I'm Detective Wilson. Is Dr. Bowden available? Detective? Yeah, just a sec. Jim. (door squeaking closed) [Allison] Detective Wilson? Hey, what's this about? Dr. Bowden, I'm going to have to ask you to come down to the station and answer a few questions. What happened to your face? I was assaulted. By my boss. Your boss assaulted you? Yeah. Dean Crawley. I guess he didn't appreciate your critique. I want to press charges. We can talk about that too. What's this about? It's about a student. Mia Pierce. You fucked her. I knew it. What? No. Why does your head immediately go there? Did you fuck your professors? Not all of them. Mrs. Bowden, please. Mia was just reported missing. We just have to ask your husband a few questions. Maybe check the strip clubs. (ominous music) Should I call my lawyer? I don't know, should you? [Officer Tapper] Why were you at her house yesterday? I was returning her bag. Why did you have her bag? Dr. Bowden asked me to return it. She left it in the classroom. [Officer Tapper] Why didn't he just give it to her? He said he was busy. (plastic bag rustling) (tool clunking down on table) [Officer Tapper] Tell me about this. Is that blood? It sure is. We found this in your garage at the frat house. Okay. (Nervously laughing) I don't know anything about that. (knocking on door) (door opening) (indistinct whispering) [Officer Tapper] All right. (door closing) (door opening/closing) (chair dragging on floor) I want to press charges against Crawley. Later. Where's Mia? How should I know? Well, word is that she's having an affair with you. And as I've said, that's a lie. You gave Alex her bag to return. Tell me about that. Why would I have her bag? That's the question, isn't it? That kid is shifty. Do you know that he's a pornographer? You mentioned it. (papers rustling) Are these your daughter's breasts? [Jim] Oh God. [Detective Wilson] Is this the pornography you mentioned? Yes. How does it make you feel about Alex? [Jim] Not good. Would you say you were angry with him? Maybe, yes. But also I saw him with Mia. Kissing. And that made you jealous? No, the kid is cheating on my daughter. Why would I be jealous? Could you please put that away? Your boss has accused you of a cyber crime. He says you hacked his computer and sent this to your daughter. I don't know how to hack anything. He's harassing her and trying to place the blame on me. You think I want that out there? Tell me about the wheels. What wheels? I hit a pothole and I bent a rim out of shape. So you replaced all four, for one damaged wheel. Twice. It turns out I didn't need the second set. I brought those back. We've got two missing people. An assault and now a cyber crime. Look at my face. I'm the victim here. Sure. I'm going through tenure now. So I guess my behavior's a little erratic. Do you know about tenure? My wife is tenured. Ah, then you know what it's like. What's her field? Chemistry. Mm, I'm in the humanities. Scientists have it much easier. I mean, so long as they're productive. I write fiction. Well, I guess that's it for now. - I can go? - Yeah. I'll be in touch. (chair sliding on floor) (feet shuffling) (door opening) Oh, Jim. I liked your book. It's salacious. [Officer Tapper] We got the weapon, we got the blood. We know who, we just need (door closing) [Alex] I didn't do it. She was my friend. I don't even know any Derek. I'm just a film student. Dr. Bowden gave me her bag. He'll tell you. Just talk to him. (ominous music) (Jim whistling) What you whistling there, Jim? Dick. It's Dean Crawley. I was at the police station last night. They know all about your transgressions. (laughing) I don't like you. I never have. I knew what kind of person you were from the get go. Oh, and what kind of person is that? A weasel. A spineless, little weasel. I need to get to my office. You know? You could have found a new job elsewhere. (heavy sigh) My lawyer has advised me not to speak. Don't start with your fucking lawyer. I've got a lawyer. You've got a lawyer. Everyone's got a lawyer! Do you know that I am indefinitely suspended? Oh no. What a shame. How could you use your own daughter like that? Well, I didn't use my daughter for any sort. (Jim choking) Don't you fucking dare deny it. We both know what you did. Adversaries, remember? Yes. That's it. Adversaries. See, this. This is all you're doing. Dick, don't. Don't what? Kill you? (Laughing) You have no value. My career is over. Seems like a reasonable alternative. But I have a better idea. Dick... It's Dean Crawley! You insignificant, little fuck. Now. Confess. To what? Everything! Should I start with your infatuation with my daughter. Okay!! Okay! I did it. I did it. I sent the email. To your daughter. Yes, but I did it FOR my daughter. You clearly had it out for me. I had to do something. Don't you dare put this on me. You could have gotten on the train. Oh. Don't start with the fucking train metaphor again. What have you accomplished lately? How many books have you written? I don't write books. I'm a dean. I run the entire college. Yeah. You go to meetings and fuck with everyone's lives. You're the reason everyone hates academics. It's us faculty that do the job of educating students. Or fucking them. (grunting) (gun firing) (body hitting floor) Wow. (groaning) I've never shot anyone before. It's different than a paper target. That looks like it hurts. It really does. Oh good. I'm so glad to hear that. I cannot tell you how many times I've wanted to do that. Not just to you, but to a lot of faculty. Always wanting something. Demanding this, demanding that. I want a raise, lower teaching load. I want a bigger office. For fuck's sake. A bunch of whining, maggots. (foot hitting body) Oh. (gun falling onto floor) (heavy breathing) (groaning) (heavy breathing) (groaning) Are you worthy, Dick? I can still get you tenure. I can and I will. You're lying. Jim. All I have is my career. My wife, she knows about the email. Does she know about you and Emily? I have a photo. Granted not a great one. (ominous music) You miserable piece of shit. (gun firing) (heavy breathing) (body hitting floor) (groaning) (groaning) (phone sliding on floor) I guess racketball is out of the question? (footsteps running) [Student 3] Professor Bowden, O-M-G. Are you like, okay? Call an ambulance right away, and the police. [Student 4] No signal. Hold tight. Dr. Bowden? Yeah. I've been meaning to talk to you about my paper.

(soft inspiring music) Holy shit. I'm tenured. (distant police sirens wailing) (door opening) (paper rustling) Hey, what's up? I heard about tenure. You did? Tell me. Let me conference in Amy. I want your both to hear this. - (phone ringing) - Hey Dad. Hey Peanut. You're on with me and mom. Is this about Alex? I can't believe that my boyfriend is a murderer. Thank God he never hurt you. We're so lucky. Listen, I've got some news. He seemed like a normal kid. A normal sociopath. Ladies, I've got something to tell you. What? I am officially tenured with promotion to associate professor. You got it. (laughing) I'm really so happy for you, dad. But I hate it here. I'm transferring. What? Well, sure honey, we can talk about that. But this is a really good thing for all of us. It is. I'm so glad for you. Well, thank you. I'm just so glad it finally happened.

Not seeing a Richard Crawley memorial bench anywhere. You? (laughing) Your legacy. A salacious book (laughing) and a fucking bench. Yeah. Well, at least I got tenure. Fucking asshole. Dick.
