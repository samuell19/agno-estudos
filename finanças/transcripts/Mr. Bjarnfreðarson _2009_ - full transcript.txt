Where is my daughter? Where is Bjarnfredur? It's a boy. Thirty-six! Thirty-seven! Thirty-eight! Thirty-nine! Thirty-six! Thirty-seven! Thirty-eight! Thirty-nine! 40... 41... 42... 43...44... keep in step! 45...46...4 7... 48... 49...and fifty! You move like handicapped kindergartners! Are you completely incapable of moving in rhythm? And again! -I should actually be doing the laundry. You're not going anywhere until you've mastered this. We've got other things to do! You'll take part like everyone else. You're a part of a team! I don't want to! And 'I don't want to' listen to anymore whining. Again, from the start! One, two, three. Everyone now! four and five! Continue! -Good morning Hjördis. -Hello. I have good news! -Oh? -Your application for parole has been approved. Parole? I haven't applied for any such thing? But I've got a letter here, signed by you Georg? That's not even my signature! It says 'Bjarnfredsson'. I would never spell my own name wrong. If that's not your signature, then whose is it? And all these recommendations from the guards? I thought... Yes, but.. I can't leave. It would be an outrage for the prison community if I left! All the good I've accomplished... The folk song revue... And the very first smoke-free cell block in Scandinavia- Yes, everyone has noticed your contributions. But this is irreversible. But what about my violations? The escape attempt? That should lengthen my sentence. And the fire! The riots last year! That was all me! I've only been here five years...out of ten. I should be here five more. At least! Five! I'm sorry Georg, but my hands are tied. It's mine! Mine! This has to be the hardest test ever! What? The test for the driver's license! Oh...right... Again? Isn't this like the sixth time? Seventh! They keep changing it! What are you guys up to, Action Man? Sounds cool. You want to play? Uncle Oli needs some breakfast. I was thinking. When you've taken that doctor's test, and you're a real doctor... -Olafur! Stop! Use a glass! Do you think your mom and dad could give us money to go on a holiday? Money? No, you know I don't like asking them for stuff like that. But they have loads of money. They've already paid for our house and the car. We owe them enough. Come on boys. You need a ride later? -No, I've got my driving lesson. Right. Bye. -Bye! Let's go boys! Is the meeting over? -Yeah. Here's copy of the sheet. Thanks. -This is Bjarnfredur Geirsdottir. Leave a message after the tone. -I understand that there are times when you're uninspired. But there're only a few weeks until graduation. and you have to start presenting some fresh ideas. Yeah... I just need some time to figure it out. It's all in my head but it's hard to put into words. You're not supposed to put it in words. You have to make it work. Something from the heart. You have endless ways of expressing yourself. Art isn't just about paintings. -Yeah I... Right. Hello? -Hello Daniel. This is Georg... It is with great sadness that I say farewell to our community But I'm thankful for the- Well, we'd best get going. -Yes. Of course. -Iceland out of Nato, US Troops back home! -Iceland out of Nato, US Troops back home! -Iceland out of Nato, US Troops back home! Mom? -It's Bjarnfredur. Bjarnfredur, I want to go home. Later. First we have to drive the Capitalist swine away! Iceland out of Nato, US Troops back home! Iceland out of Nato, US Troops back home! My name is Einar and I want to be a waiter when I grow up. I'm Harpa and I want to become a police woman. I want to be a teacher. Shopkeeper. -What do you want to be when you grow up? A cowboy and go to America. I've told everyone that you want to become a great leader. But now you want to chase cows in America? You have made a liar out of me! Did you put my flowers on Gubjörg's grave? Yeah, I did. Any news of Olafur? Yes...he's staying with me. -Oh? Some problems with housing. -Still the same, eh? And you'll soon be graduating? Doctor Daniel? -Erm...yeah. Hello Bjarnfredur! I have been discharged... I'm free. You were supposed to be locked up for five more years! I've paid my debt to society. What is he doing here? Just tell her that you drove me, because I asked you. I can't take him in. But this is my home. The place I grew up! I could never have you here. You murdered a woman! But where am I to sleep? Tell him that If I see him near my home again, I will call the police! Don't fight, boys There you go. Eat politely. Hello Ma'am I offered him a place to stay. Just for a day or two. He just got out. Here? Yes. But only until he gets back on his feet. Can we talk in private? Hello comrades! What's going on? Wasn't he the guy that got you into jail? Yea, but...you know. Olafur was in jail with you too. -Yes... You can't take home everyone who was in jail with you. It's only for a few days. But he's so weird! I understand your concerns, but this is only temporary. I will find a job and another place to stay as soon as I can. Until then, I will of course do my share of work for our community. For example cooking or cleaning. I examined your kitchen, and found some things that could do with improvement. I know I'm not supposed to smoke with food in the car. But I haven't had a cigarette today so... Your license please. -Erm...yes. Could we maybe do this later? I have this order I need to deliver. There aren't any license plates on your car? No, they were stolen... so I just made some new ones. Why didn't you report it? -I didn't know I had to... This vehicle isn't registered. -What? You can't drive this car No that can't be. I was driving it just moments ago. The plates have been removed. It hasn't been inspected for years! It's a company car. -That doesn't matter. It's just as unregistered. Give me your keys, sir. The gears are a bit tricky. Could you give me a ride? The food's deducted from my pay if I'm late. It's like a rule. 'The One-Hour Rule'. Easy with the attitude! Coming aboard, son? -FM Radio. Hi, this is Oli. It's locked. -Oli? Olafur Ragnar, from Bangkok princess. I've got a delivery for you. -Welcome to civilization. Weren't you supposed to be here a month ago! Yeah, I had to change busses, like five times. You're delivering by bus? -Erm...yeah? -That explains it! The guy's delivering food by bus! Would you be open to discuss the One-Hour Rule? You're listening to FM-957. The heat is on, but we keep it cool. 'The Cool Dudes' with you until ten this evening. So don't touch that dial, 'cause the music is so good, your head is gonna spin. We're talking to Olafur, from Bangkok princess. So, are you just delivering with your bus pass? Are you kidding me? -Yeah, this isn't Formula 1. If Schumacher was delivering, there'd be no One-Hour Rule. More like the Two-Minute Rule. 'Hey buddy, the noodles are on their way.' And you're just taking it easy here on the radio. Won't your boss get mad? Who? Dmitri? No, he's cool. Unlike this other guy I worked for, at a gas station. That guy was a psycho! He was bald, had glasses and lived with his mom. Do we have to discuss it? Who lives with their mom? Did she make him his lunch? He was always collecting bottles and cans for a trip to Sweden. To do what? Buy a Volvo? Screw together IKEA furniture with some refreshing organic beer on the side? Does he have his own web-page? -Hello Olafur... Daniel! What's Georg doing in my room? Georg? I... I offered him a place to stay. He just got out. But why my room? I can't let him stay in here or with the boys. Why not! I pay rent! -You haven't paid any rent. But...you know everything goes to hell whenever he's around! How do you think it'll look if I bring chicks home and there's an old, bald guy in my room! I'm only a few years older than you Olafur. Do you just barge into people's bedrooms? Are you mental? -Pardon me... -Is it morning already? Can I borrow some cash. There's this taxi outside. -I can pay for it if you need it. Here you go. 5000 kroner's. -The Supreme Court lengthened the sentence over Georg Bjarnfredarson -The Supreme Court lengthened the sentence over Georg Bjarnfredarson who was convicted for involuntary manslaughter And, according to court documents, 'conspiracy and reckless conduct subsequent to his crime.' Last week The Supreme Court affirmed a 14 month sentence over Daniel Saevarsson for his part in the crime. The details of the case are that last May, Gudbjörg Ragnarsdottir, hotel manager was found unconscious close to Hotel Bjarkalundur in Reykholar-county. Gudbjörg was rushed to hospital where she consequently succumbed to her injuries three weeks later. Daniel Saevarsson testified in court that Georg manipulated him into believing that he was responsible for Gudbjörg's injuries and that Georg did not admit to his guilt until several weeks later. A reporter for Channel Two spoke to Olafur Ragnar Hannesson A key witness and one of the four employees at the hotel. Georg? Well it was news to me. He was never violent towards me. Except once, when he sprayed some cleaning liquid into my eyes. That time he was mad. But I know why that was. And then once before...but that was a self...self-defensing class. And once more at the hotel. But then he was tripping on mushrooms, so... Georg's mother, Bjarnfredur Geirsdottir, a well-known women's liberation advocate was present at the court ruling but declined to comment. Oli my boy? Olafur? What? Good night. I peeled a beet for you and made some rye bread as well. Can't you go with me? -No. Georg Bjarnfredarson, it's your first day of school and time you learn to stand on your own two feet. Goodbye Bjarnfredur. -Goodbye Georg. Why are you wearing a girl's coat? I'm protesting gender discrimination through clothing. Huh? What are you talking about? There is no difference between boys and girls. Who says? -Bjarnfredur. Bjarnfredur? Who's that? A boy or a girl. My mother. -We worry that Georg isn't fitting in. Georg is highly intelligent and I refuse to allow you to turn him into some ignorant bourgeoisie. Not while I'm his mother. -That's not the issue- Do you have a policy regarding equality? Equality? Do girls have the same opportunities as boys? Of course. But still you divide boys and girls by clothing? -Parents decide themselves what their children wear. What I'm trying to say is that we worry that Georg will have a hard time fitting in because of the way he's dressed. He's a feminist! Aren't you a feminist Georg? Yes... -He is very conscious of class and gender. You could learn much from him. This looks very good. -Thank you. This looks very good. -Thank you. It's not often we get applicants with five university degrees. Education is the most important tool of man. Yes! There we agree Georg. You're qualified to teach more than one subject. Who knows, we might have you teaching full time. That would make me a happy man. We'll contact you after the weekend to finish up. It was a pleasure meeting you. The pleasure is mine, I'll wait with baited breath for your call. Bye. -Goodbye Ah, there's one thing missing. Just a formality. Your criminal record. Just sign a permission note at the front desk and we'll get it. -I decided to apply here, as I've had good experience working at this gas station. -Georg Bjarnfredarson? That name... Why does it remind me... of the company's annual celebration? Did you recently quit? No, it's been awhile. Georg...? Riiight... Georg Bjarnfredarson complaints volume I & ll Hot dog with bacon. And a pint of cream. Hello? -Olafur Ragnar? Yes? -The President of Iceland? What? Just kidding, Denni Ding Dong here, program director for FM 957. You delivered some food and were very entertaining on air You made a good impression. -Really? Yes. Are you interested in working in radio? We've got an open slot where we want to try something fresh. Are you for real? This isn't a joke? No, for real. You'd be working without pay until we find a sponsor, but there are benefits, like movie tickets, fast-food offers and suchlike. [Political discrimination in East End School] Becoming Class President is only the first step. You'll defeat your opponent like comrade Castro crushed Batista. Viva la revulsion! -Rev-o-lu-tion! I only made a few changes, otherwise your speech is perfect. Thank you Bjarnfredur. I believe in you Georg, and your future. You'll become a great man, and make me proud. -Many agree that I am the most intelligent student in class Therefore it is only natural that I assume a role of leadership. I propose that the school conducts intelligence tests and divide students into groups based on their scores and their potential. Furthermore I demand that students that excel be given positions of authority and should guide other students regarding activities and dress codes- Fatty Georg! He's interrupting my speech! Finally, I propose to lengthen school days and dramatically reduce summer holidays These are my promises. To vote for Georg, is to forge ahead! Thank you for your time and... Viva la revolution! Hi! I think we've all had a great time in this class. I want to hold a pajama party and two ski trips this year. Last year there was just one, so I want one before the holidays And one after. Thank you. Your father and me have decided on your graduation present. We're erasing all your debts to us. All my debts? Everything we've paid for during your studies. But...not the house and- -I know you are proud, dear But the decision has been made and we won't budge on it. [mumbles incoherently] There's another thing your father wants to share with you. He knows it's your father's old bag. Open it! [mumbles incoherently] Pardon? This is so important to your father. He can't work anymore. And it's hard for him. You don't have to be coy about your feelings! He's your son! Just the fact that you're finally graduating as a doctor is so important to him. He loves you very much. And we're both very proud of you. [mumbles incoherently] I'm sorry honey. I'll let you two talk in private. [Driving instructor] -Hello Ma'am. I want to discuss the workflow in our little 'community'. What? There is too much waste. Everything could be more efficient If we'd agree on these proposals I've jotted down- Mom! Mom! -Someone's taken our toys! Ah, another thing I wanted to discuss. I made an informal assessment of their development and they are retarded... developmentally speaking. Boys at their age need constant nurture to grow into healthy individuals. -You took away their toys? Toys promoting violent behavior, stunting their cerebral growth. They'll go nuts if they don't get their toys back! You don't understand! I'm trying to save them. From becoming like y- ...erm...mentally defective. Where are their toys?! -EQUALITY IN PLACE OF SPENDING SPREES! -Move away from the store. -The Fat cats stole Christmas from the children! Bjarnfredur? Why don't we have food like the other kids? The other children? What do they get? Christmas Ham... Christmas Ham? Do you know what that is? Christmas food? -No! The back of a murdered pig! We don't eat meat, because we are not carrion-eaters. The human body is not made to digest meat. Open for your grandparents. And do as we discussed. Hello Bjarnfredur. -Hello Geir. Hello mother. Comrade Aslaug... Take my overcoat and hang it up. Georg will do it. Look at the boy... He's like a shrimp! Are you such a fussy eater? Please join me in the living room. There are less than pleasant news coming from Vietnam. American soldiers have taken up the hobby of murdering children! And they're using a chemical named Napalm. It is a type of petroleum filth they spray on innocent children And then set them on fire. To think that civilized nations don't condemn this barbarism. The Soviet Union protested this! Brezhnev brought it up at the party conference, this fall. But it seems like the entire international community is paralyzed, so the high and mighty Americans can do what they damn well please. But didn't Germany and Sweden release a statement? Swedes? Pseudo-communists and social democrats! Who do you think listens to a puny nation like Sweden? No one! You need great nations like the Soviet Union and China to finally put an end to those imperialistic hogs! Then they'd listen! If the proletariat would say "No!" to the American army! "No! You do not get to murder and mutilate children!" "No! You do not get to burn children alive!" No! No! No! And no again! What's the matter with the boy? Is he thickheaded? [mumbles incoherently] 'To Bjarnfredur and Georg, From Geir and Aslaug'. How exciting. My my... Look what grandpa and grandma gave us! Now go and say thank you. I had it framed, so it wouldn't get scuffed if the boy got his hands on it. Georg, you can open the present from me now. This is a wooden lyre made in Udevalla in Sweden. By Per Sörenson, my friend Lovisa's nephew. But I wanted a choo-choo train set. Speak properly boy! I asked Santa for it... [American Train Sets on Sale!] We've already discussed this Georg. There is no Santa Claus! He's just a symbol for American consumerism. Do you know what capitalists are Georg? Terrible men who brainwash children with depraved pamphlets for the express purpose of selling products. Who are the most ignorant and despicable people in this world? ...Capitalists? Yes. And America! United states of stupidity! Who defiled The Lady of our Mountain? Pulled up her skirts and jabbed at her with their gun muzzles while they chomped on American chewing-gum! But I wanted a choo-choo train set! Christmas isn't about commercialism! It's a celebration of family! 'As a misunderstanding begins, it tends to envelope-' 'Like a storm that drags everything along and spins-' 'Something no one can stop.' Yes? -Hello Daniel dear. -Working late at the hospital? Yes...I'll probably be late. -Which ward? Erm...Ear, Nose and Throat... -I'm popping over to get your measurements for the suit. Can't we do it tomorrow? -The suit needs to be ready for your graduation! -We'll be there in fifteen minutes. Hi! -Hi! Are they keeping you really busy? I was just...there was this really sick patient. The nurse had never heard your name? Oh? Well, she's new here. Hi honey! Let's do this outside- I know you're busy dear. It'll be over in a jiffy. Stretch out your arms. And straighten your back. -Stand straight. -But isn't that weird? -He promised he'd only be here for a couple of days. -Maybe he's just using you? -Using me? How? Hi! -Hi. This is Gestur! Yes... hello? Gestur is the best driving instructor, ever! Oh...okay? Don't you think that's a cool shirt? I just bought it. -Tell him who picked it out! You were shopping for clothes together? I'm not very knowledgeable on clothes and such. I see. Hey, what should we have for dinner? Tonight? No, you mongo! On graduation day! Right. I don't know- -Chicken! Sure. -Thanks to Fridrik for stopping by. Always a pleasure. -We'll have more guests popping in later, but first -We'll have more guests popping in later, but first I'm taking some calls. No time for political crap. Just chicks and beer. You know the drill, and the number! This is FM! -Hi! You still giving party-packs? Yes indeedy, are you holding a party? -Yes, a bunch of us girls. How many are you? -There's five of us. Is it off the hook? Can I get a holler? That's off the hook enough for me. You'll get your party-pack. Beer and pizza coming up. We've got another one on the line. This is FM. -Hello. Can I request a song? No prob, what's your poison? -Just a classic Icelandic one. Done and done. It's on the way. FM, you're on the air. -You hung up on us? The party. -I didn't tell you where to send it. -Oh, okay. Where you at? -In the suburbs- The burbs? No problemo. -But the address- No problem's too big for the FM-clan. The Music Hour is upon us which means what? Honored comrades! It gives me great pleasure to announce that tonight there's a TV interview with Bjarnfredur Geirsdottir... My mother. I urge everyone to see it since it will undoubtedly be both informative...and fun! Okay. What? Is something wrong? -I don't want to be a murderer! What are you talking about? -I'm not a ca...carrion-eater! I don't want you telling them things like that. -But they asked. And since I am a trained pedagogue- It's not your place! They are my children. Try raising your own son. Actually he's in Denmark... -Well there you go, that's the result from your methods. His mother had a hand in it too... When is he leaving? -Daddy! We drew a picture! Later boys. Oli! Oli, we drew you a picture! -Right on! A rocket ship! It's a chick building a rocket ship! 'Pretty sweet! Draw some more! -How do you increase the volume on this thing? Here. -My guest today is a woman who has dedicated her life -to fight for human rights. And now The Woman's Peace Force is going to present her with a Lifetime Achievement award. A Woman Named... Bjarnfredur Geirsdottir. Welcome Bjarnfredur. -Thank you Elinborg. You first came to prominence after 'The Pool Protests'. Yes, that certainly caught everyone's attention. It was such a novelty then to protest the restrictions placed on the female body. Men can waltz around topless and no one cares about what effect that might have on women. But then again, women's voices seem to be more readily ignored. This topless protest got a lot of attention from the press. And you were interviewed by, among others, Berlingske Tidende. Who published an infamous picture of you. -Around then we started the Vagina discussion groups. The patriarchal culture tends to mystify the vagina. They exit it at birth and then it's as if they desire nothing more... Than to get back inside! But this mystification doesn't come from women. We started The Vagina Introductions, where women could come and get to know their vaginas with a mirror, and see how harmless and common the vulva really is. And those classes were held in your home? -Yes. It was important to have an open and accepting atmosphere. So one could say the liberation started in your living room? Yes you could. The late, great artist Oddny Kristmunds- and Gudrúnardottir, made us a giant Vagina, out of horse hairs, Styrofoam and wool. But what about your personal life? As a public persona, I have never enjoyed much privacy. Any family? No. I've always been by myself. No children? -No, but I've had some cats. I have great fondness for animals. Never found Mr. Right? -My friend Doctor Kristrún Zoega told me... -So... I think it might be for the best If I tried to go back to prison. If you need to talk about this- There's nothing to discuss. Bjarnfredur is just... ...a great ideologist. Yeah... But she's not exactly... ...normal. No one is 'normal' Are you peeping? What's inside there? -You want to know? Bugs. Do you know what the silverfish do? They jump into your mouth. And wriggle their way down into your belly and eat up everything you've eaten. Until they're nice... and chubby. Do you want to look inside now, Georg? No... -No? Bjarnfredur? What is it? Do I have a father? Why are you asking? I just wanted to know. Your surname is your mother's and you should be proud of that. Is this... my father? Where did you get this? In your drawer. Olof Palme is a great man. He is the leader of Social Democrats in Sweden. Is he...? I don't want you going through my personal things, Georg! Go and finish your homework. Go! Georg. You've got mail. What? From whom? Just read it. It's in Swedish. 'Dear Georg.' 'I hope you're always good and helpful to your mother' 'Especially when she's tired or sad.' 'I encourage you to listen to your mother' 'and always do as she tells you.' 'Trust Bjarnfredur, she knows best.' 'I urge you to study feminist theory, green politics' 'and organic dieting as Bjarnfredur has taught you,' 'As this will mold you into a great man, like myself.' Georg... Olofsson... Palme. 'I hope you will write back someday... Dad' How did you get in? Who sent all these presents? Why are they from America? Is this my father? It's irrelevant. I raised you. Just answer my question Bjarnfredur! Yes. He is your biological father... American. But lives in Sweden? He's never been to Sweden, as far as I know. But who wrote all those Swedish letters? Roy may have been your biological father, but not ideologically. It was after the 'US Army protest walk', in sixty-four. And you know how Geir, your grandfather, had opinions. Are you here to punish me for that? One moment of weakness? One moment of lust while under the influence? So I was conceived in a... ...drunken fling with an American soldier? It wasn't like that! Time has made it null and void. But why didn't I get any of these presents? I was a single mother and did the best I could. But today I'm an old woman, recovering after a surgery. And you have no right to go through my personal belongings. After all you've put me through. Georg! -Hello and good day, this is the President... The President salutes and will accompany you until 2 pm. A red hot music hour coming right up. All the hottest bands. -If you don't scram I'll call the police! You filthy mongrel! -I've got a right to see my son. POLICE! What the hell is wrong with you? Freddie I wanna see my son! Get out! -Please Freddie I wanna see my son! Get out! -Freddie! Goddamn child killer! Georg! Away from that window! Hi. Feeling a little down? No. What's that? Did you buy that? It's a gift. Oh okay? For your son Flemming? No. For me... Are you gonna play with that? I might have... once upon a time. If you need to cheer up, I could hook you up with a party-pack. A case of beer and some pizza. Just for you. Thank you Oli. No prob. I just add your name to a list, and you get one delivered. There has always been a link between us, hasn't there? Eh...yeah, sure. [Salvation Army] Good day to you. -Can I help? I need clothes in the current style. A jacket, a shirt and blue nankeen trousers. The shoes are very important. They're named Buffalo. Hi. -Hi! D'ya want a raffle ticket? -Yes... The ticket costs one hundred. -Okay? How much for all of them? Can I help? Yes. Do we need to discuss that any further? Give me 200 grams of your freshest minced meat. Isn't this ever popular with you meat eaters? Eh? What is up, doctor! That's a swinging tune! -Top music all the time on FM 957. -The President is here to stay. Lots of stuff up ahead. But we have a guest. My nephew and the lead singer for the band Solin. Kiddi Casio. Welcome! -Howdy, couple of times! So what's up with Solin? -It's all good. We're doing a reunion tour. Starting with Sandgerdi, blessed be. Then around the country to party, jam, rock and roll! Ok! You brought some tickets? Originally I was gonna give them to the family help center..haha! But we should try to get some decent babes to this gig. So open those lines! You know the drill. The number is 5110957 If you want a ticket to tonight's concert at Café Casio. Let's see who's on the line. FM?. -Hello? How do you do, do you want a ticket? -Yes, good afternoon. My name is Georg Bjarnfredarson. -Can I please have a word with Olafur Ragnar Hannesson? Georg? Could you call back later? -Ah Oli! I just wanted to tell you how I've changed! We're going to check if there's someone else on hold. Fm? -Olafur? Georg, hang up so I can talk to other callers! What is this, public radio? Is it time for the weather? Aren't we giving away tickets? -What's going on Olafur? It's as if someone else is on the line? Hello? -Georg, hang up! Should I call later, Olafur? We have a... a brand new music of hour coming up. And it's time to sound how it hears. Oli? The tickets? Olafur? What did you do to my room? Hi Oli! Your room was a bit of a mess so I cleaned it up. I don't want you to touch my stuff! You want to have a messy room? It's not a mess! That's my stuff! Well, all right, I won't do it again. But! I have a little surprise for you Olafur. Surprise? What surprise? I cooked for you. -Yippee. Some bean-crap? Am I gonna be farting for weeks? -No nothing like that. I made you... a hamburger! That is not a hamburger!! -Yes it is! There's not a chance in hell I'm going to eat this. But there's meat in it! I made a special trip to the meat section and asked for their best meat. That's not a hamburger like I want it! How do you want it? Like you see in pictures! It's exactly the same! -No, it's exactly different! -You have a visitor? -Yes... Don't you want to offer him some refreshments? You want some beetroot juice? -Yes please. -Are you sure you can handle it? -It's no problem. Call me if anything comes up. -Don't you trust this face? Erm...yes. Just take care. -All right, be seeing you. What are you guys up to? -Drawing. All right? That's a cool picture. Where's your dad? -He's inside, inside the house. -He didn't want to come out to play. -Okay? Boys, how would you like to go to the petting zoo, by BUS! Will there be ice cream? -Ice cream! And plenty of it! Where are you guys going? Let's race! -Be careful boys! Aren't you worried about feeding them so much sugar? No worries. They're Daniel's boys. It's really wonderful to sit here with you my friend. In this beautiful weather with a dear friend. I will never forget when first I laid eyes on you. It was as if I had known you my entire life. As if a portrait of you had been in my mind's eye. I just want you to know... You are very dear to me. Oh, okay. Very dear. Georg, could you maybe stop talking like this? Look...Georg. Boys! Are you losing your minds! That ice cream isn't free! -Isn't it The President? -What? Olafur from FM? -Er...yes? I'm a photographer for 'The Gossip'. Mind if I take your picture? Sounds like a wonderful idea! 'No I... Come on boys! I don't think he wants a photo of you... And you are? I just talk into the camera? -Yes. Georg Bjarnfredarson... Olafur's mate. [The President and Family at the petting zoo] [The President and Family at the petting zoo] Hey, some guy called earlier, said he was your housemate. He was worried you hadn't come home last night. Mate..? -Yeah, can't remember his name... Do I look like I'm mating? No? -No, I didn't think so. Party tonight, at my place! Everyone's welcome, especially babes. Plenty of beer and enough space. Georg? -Georg? Are you home? -I'm in the bathroom. Just come in. Hi Oli! Did you see the magazine? Yes. Look... I've been thinking about you and me. How we get along... -Oh? I know I've been... a little grouchy. -Yes? I was thinking, to fix that to invite you to a party. Me? Yes, I'm holding an FM party and I'd love for you to be there. Where is this 'party'? Erm... Motel Venus... It's out of town. I'll be there after my shift. We can grab a beer and stuff. Yes, wouldn't that be swell? I'll have an ice-cold beer with you. You could perhaps go earlier. I really look forward to this. Right, aha, sure. So it's a done deal. -You need to be nice to Daniel. Otherwise your sister will be sad. -Let's go Guffi dear. -The dinner is starting. -Daniel and Ylfa. Come on honey. -Look how nice it is. They have to mow the roof! Are we early, dear? -No, come on in. Hello my friend. -You look so handsome. Erm... is The President at home? The President? -Yes, Oli? Olafur Ragnar? -Yes? The crew's all here! I just invited a few friends to my room. We'll be really quiet. Okay. Good evening. -Evening. I'm here to party. Oh? Might I, later this evening purchase from you an ice cold 'brewsky?' Beer? -Certainly. Excellent! Excellent. Congratulations dear. Now I'm a Doctor's woman. A doctor's missus. -Ehh...I'm not that old. It's a shame you didn't want to attend the ceremony Daniel. Yeah. I'll explain it later. Your brother sends his regards. He and Tammy were just returning from Palm Springs. John Saevar was competing at a charity golf match. -Special! Yes honey. He's special. Just like you. Yes? -The whole women's club was there, except for Maggie. Maggie? -The chairman, remember? -My, what a delightful smell. Did you hire a chef? No, this is Gestur. My driving instructor. I'm making the starter. Caramelized goat cheese and mousse-au-chocolat for dessert. I'm serving a boiled chicken. -Boiled? In wine, or..? No mongo, Chicken. Your suit fits you perfectly. -Hmm? Aren't you happy with it? -It's a little tight on him. Olafur! One ice cold brewsky for you. Nice to have you over. Grab a beer. There's plenty. Fun, fun. Aren't you hungry, honey? You want some cocktail sauce? -Not too much cola. You know how you get. Dola's good for stomach. You don't know that Guffi. You're retarded! -No... On behalf of us, Daniel's parents. I want to say how immensely proud we are of our boy. Ever since Daniel was young whenever he had a birthday, or at Christmas, his father bought for him toys and things to stimulate his interest in medicine. This has evidently paid off. Good evening. -Good evening. Are you here for Olafur's party? No? Good evening... Excuse me! Has anybody left a message for me? Georg Bjarnfredarson? -Not that I know of. Are you expecting a call? I'm expecting my mate! -I'll let you know if anyone calls. Thank you! Well! We have some very special guests who usually put on a show at family gatherings. I'm proud to present: The Ylfa and Guffi Smart revue! Give them a hand! Petey has bought a fancy new car pants and a suit, he is a star. The road it is bumpy, away we go bouncing along with our show. Spinning right and spinning left with hump-a-bump and hopping hold onto to you're chair my friend cause we aren't stopping We have to be careful. or else we'll be dropping We're jumping here... It'll be all right honey. Good job Guffi. -Guffi sing-ah. Would you like to say a few words Daniel dear? Yes... I want to ask you to raise your glasses. I want to thank you all so very much for coming. Apart from that guy... I don't even know what that guy is doing here? Who is he anyway? -It's Gestur... I just think it's very weird that he's here. Anyways... You're here to celebrate me graduating in medicine. But I'm not celebrating it. The thing is, I haven't been studying medicine. I've been studying art. At the Icelandic art academy. And tomorrow I'll premier my graduation piece at a gallery. What kind of a joke is this Daniel? It's not a joke. Sorry. I've just been lying. Lying and lying and lying. You know... I've always done whatever you all wanted me to do. But not anymore... I studied art for myself. You're welcome to my show, and I'd like to see you. But if you're really pissed off 'cause I wasn't studying medicine. Then just... Fuck it. I don't believe a word you're saying Daniel? That's just how it is, mom. So I'm not a doctor-woman? -No, you're an art-woman. No you're... You're the wife of Daniel Saevarsson. Artist. Cheers. Since people are opening up here, I think I might as well too. And it would be uncomfortable to keep it a secret any longer. But I've been in love with Ylfa since her first driving lesson. I just wanted it... ...public. Stop it! Stop it!! Yes exactly. Cut it out! What's going on here? [Mumbles incoherently] You guys wanna party? We have to pump up that stereo! -Hello? -Hello? Who is it? Daniel. -Hello! This is Georg. Do you know how long Olafur will be at that late shift? The late shift? -At the radio? He's just here. Hey, I have to tell you something. -He's what? I'm sorry, I wanted to tell you earlier. I might have done it without thinking... I just think you owe me one. -I can't hear a word of what you're saying. You... are my graduation piece! Am I what? You're...eh... I can't hear you. Just come on over. There's a party! Who's a party animal?! THE PRESIDENT! Daniel? Daniel? Is there any more beer? Daniel? Excuse me. Excuse me. Olafur! What are you doing, man? I've been sitting alone at that hotel, waiting for you since seven! Yeah? So? -Didn't we have a date? A date, with you? Eh, no? Who told you that? The voices in your head? No, you suggested it yourself! They called from the nuthouse, they're coming for you. No! 'NO!' What, is this candid camera? -Olafur..? Why don't you go watch TV instead of bothering me? I thought we were friends... I wanted to ask for your forgiveness... I know I may have been unfair to you through the years. But you are my best friend and I would do anything to fix things between us. So we could follow the same path. And develop our friendship. Do you just go around parties to fuck'em up? How can I make you disappear? A ninja bomb? No wait, you're still here! Was it defective or something? What was that? Who ordered that pizza...? Who's there? -Bjarnfredur? -It's Georg... -Bjarnfredur? Go away or I'll call the police! -I'm here to say goodbye. -Are you drunk? No... I'm leaving. Good! Goodbye Georg. -This is my last farewell. -Right. -Goodbye Bjarnfredur. -Goodbye Georg. -Afternoon. -Hello, can I help you? Yes. I'd like a bottle of your finest alcohol. -Daniel? -Daniel? Have you seen Georg? -Huh? I need to speak to him. Is something wrong? I just need to see him. Shit. What's the time? [THE ICELANDIC ART ACADEMY GRADUATION SHOW] -I AM THE SUPERVISOR! SUPERVISOR HERE! -As a misunderstanding begins, ...it tends to envelope everyone. -A storm that drags everything along and spins us around. -Something no one can stop, ...leaving you alone at sea. -Your only thought is to keep your head above water. -The storm has... a cyclone... first and foremost... [more ranting] -A... big... misunderstanding. Misunderstanding! Nice work, man. I have always been alone. Where did you get those photos? At a raffle. Bjarnfredur... gave them away. I see. How... How do you like it? Yes...it is... Just fine. -As a misunderstanding begins, ...it tends to envelope everyone. She has an impact on everyone, leaving no one untouched. She has an impact on everyone, leaving no one untouched. Bjarnfredur is a strong and elegant representative of the Icelandic woman, and has been for over 40 years. Let's give a warm round of applause for a tough lady and a child of nature... Bjarnfredur Geirsdottir! Good evening. My name is Georg and I'm Bjarnfredur's son. My life has been an endless battle against windmills. I have never known true friendship or anything normal. And now the world has turned its back on me. I am nothing to it. As I am nothing to Bjarnfredur. Georg, that's enough! No, I'm just getting started. I was born normal, but this woman deliberately ruined me. She wanted me to become a great man, but at the same time did everything she could so I would never become myself. -Everything's at boiling point. I might even be deep fried. That's not like being well done. Doesn't matter. Tape me down. I'm just rambling. And at some point, I started to play a role I've been stuck in for all of my life. I obeyed, in the childish hope that one day Olof Palme would come and be proud of me. Why don't you tell your friends about Roy Washington? I hope to see you soon son. Yes... So today, with all of you as my witnesses, I disassociate myself from this woman. I am not Georg Bjarnfredarson. I am... Georg Washington! -What is your name? -Georg. -What do you want to be when you grow up? A cowboy and go to America.
