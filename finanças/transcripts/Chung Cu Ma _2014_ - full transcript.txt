I can't just get rid of our baby. This apartment, I built it for you, Japanese style as the way you wanted. I gave you a good job at the club, made you a manager. You're living a good life now. What more do you want? Or... ...do you want to go back being a masseuse? I don't care about any of that. All I want is our baby... ...even if it means giving everything up. You dare go against me? Just remember... ...I still have your wife's number. I'm sorry. I should understand your emotions. Let's have a drink for our happy family. You... You... You're a bastard. I'll never... ...forgive you. This is the last song to escort you. "Conjuring Spirit" "Few Years Later" Another truck is parking here? Sorry sir, it'll be done soon. Let me help you, uncle! I don't need your help. Mind your business. Have you just moved here? Don't mind the old man! Mom, is this the place? That's right dear, this is where we're going to live. You... You little evil! Scared me to death! If I die, I'll come back to haunt you 'til all your boyfriends run off. Why do you still like watching horror movies while you are afraid of ghosts? I can't even finish that one. I'm surprised you haven't died from a heart attack. Yeah, it's creepy. I don't think I can even pick up the phone after watching this one. Geez. So silly! Get out! You're so heavy. -Mom, open the door. -No, you go open it. -You're so childish. -You're the child. So open it. No! No! Come on! Let's go together. Mom, you first. Whoa, LAN! I thought you were coming in the afternoon. The movers arrived early. Bi, say hi to everyone. Good morning, Aunt Thao and Sister Ngoc. -Come inside. -Thanks. Sister, do you love me? Yes, of course. Calm down, then you can talk to Cuong and figure things out. There's no more to figure out! Let him do whatever he wants, I've taken Bi away from him. LAN, this isn't... -Dad, you're home. -You're playing game, huh? Why are you home so early? I thought you wouldn't be home tonight. I came home early to be with you, honey. Hello, LAN. I heard your new book is doing well. It's doing okay. Good to hear. -We'll catch up later. -Yes! You see? A good husband should be like Quyen. Not like mine... Can you believe my husband said I'm crazy? Women often suffer so much because of men. Is it worth it? Well... forget it. We move here to start a new life. But... I still worry about you, LAN. Don't worry so much. I'm doing fine. Everything will be fine. I'll have time for myself, And finish my book. Especially living next to you... in case of anything... Anything what? There might be something if you stay in that apartment. What else is there to lose? Moving here is the best for me and Bi. However, I heard from ladies around here... they said your apartment was haunted. Haunted? Thao, you know I don't believe any of that. Bi! -Mom? -Come here to Mom. Do you like living here? This apartment is different from our old house, isn't it, Mom? It's a little bit smaller, but enough for us -Be careful, son. -I know. Gods of Heaven and Earth... please hear my prayers -Excuse me. -Stop. Don't move. I sense a strong presence in this room. -Just a cat. -You need something? Have a seat. Sorry to bother you. Here's this month's rent. And another thing... on my living room's floor... there's something like mud. Not sure if it's due to a water leak somewhere. Can you get someone to take a look at it? Don't worry. Water leaking... is a problem that everyone experience here Bi? -Your son? -Yeah, my son. Five years old. He's very active. He doesn't like to sit tight. -I should go find him. -Wait! Let me give you something. Here it is. I found this music box a while ago. Now, give it to your son. Thank you. Auntie, I love him so much. Probably from now on, I won't fall in love with anyone else. Don't worry You're still young, you'll meet more. -Who's that? -It's Vu... your neighbor downstairs. Hi! I thought this box is yours. Let me leave it here. So, it traveled to your room. Well... This is my favorite in the series. The author... Van LAN, is a good writer. -Oh really? You think so? -Of course. And she's cute too. You're too confident. Must be confident when in need. Auntie, we have a guest? This is Ngoc, my niece. -He... Hello uncle! -I'm that old? Well... no. You're a musician? I like music. -Do you play guitar? -Guitar? Of course. That's what I do for a living. Auntie, playing guitars is so sexy. Sexy! You mind if I take a pic... for Facebook? Yeah, yeah, I agree! Never thought I'd be a neighbor to a famous person. Come on! -I'm not really famous. -One, two, three, cheese! -Thank you. -Thanks. Please go out. You know where I am if you need anything. Just go to third floor, I'm always ready to help. -Yeah, I know. -Thanks. -Bye! -Bye! -So ridiculous! -Auntie, you don't like him? No! Help me! LAN! LAN! Do you hear me? It seems like you're manifesting these things in your mind... in such a way that they're contributing further to your stress. What should I do now? Close your eyes. Just close your eyes. Now breathe deeply. What are you most afraid of? If I had been through what you have, I wouldn't have known how... With this kind of trauma you experienced, being close to your relatives or friends is the best thing for you. My advice for you is take this as a challenge. In order to accept the truth, you must learn how to control your emotions. If you can't, it'll get worse. Take this medicine. It's a new prescription. It'll help you relax. Some extra money for you. Remember... keep an eye out for me. -I'm sorry Miss. -Sorry. Thanks. You must be new around here. Yes, my son and I just moved here. We're in apartment 4A. 4A, really? Let me introduce myself, I'm Xung. Nice to meet you, Mr Xung. I'm LAN. Have you been living here long? I don't live here. I own this building. Oh. I'm sorry I didn't know you're owner. OK. I have to go now. Dad! It's me! Do you miss me? Dad, when are you going to visit me? How many days? Okay... bye. Who called, honey? What are you writing Mom? I'm writing another story about Detective Kieu, sweetie. We like her, huh? Yes, we do. -How about Bi let Mom continue writing? -Yes, Mom. -Can Bi be a good boy and go to bed? -I can. Give me a kiss. -I'll tuck you in bed a little later -Yes, mommy. Bi. Play with me. I will, but you have to promise me one thing. Bi? Who are you talking to? -Bi? -Yeah? -Who were you talking to? -Miss. -Miss? What miss? -It's a secret. I'm not telling you. Miss only plays with me. Oh, I know. She is like Miss Diep, our old neighbor? She's my friend too. Did she become invisible and come to visit you today? You don't know anything. She doesn't want to play with you. If she doesn't want to play with me, mommy will play with you. All right, mommy. Stop. Stop. -Get some sleep sweetie. -Yes. Before sleeping, Bi say good night to your imaginary miss. Good night miss! -Do you love me? -Yes. I love you too -Good night sweetie. -You too, mom. I think new challenges are good, especially for your main character. But, LAN... the publisher is getting anxious. If we can't finish the book soon, our shot at getting the international distribution will be out the window. Which means no money. We've worked really hard to get where we are at today. You've completed 6 books. We all know everything you've been going through, we're all sympathetic. -You must try. -I know that. I know that I must try. I need to make a decision about what I'm going to do. These new challenges for Detective Kieu, they're giving her so much disorders. I'm afraid that when the book finishes, it may shatter her entire point of view about the world. No dog shit. What are you doing? Well... actually I'm practicing my moonwalk... of Michael. Didn't know you can dance. It's my profession. I've been writing and practicing a new song. Please forgive me if there's any inconvenience. -Oh, you're a writer too? -Yes! If you're not busy later, maybe I can take you out for a dinner or some coffee. We can talk more about our writing. So what do you think? Sounds good... but I'm always busy. You don't realize what you're missing, do you? Please stop, you're embarrassing yourself. You don't like Michael's music. OK, how about opera? Opera. La la la la la LAN, please agree... LAN, please agree to go with me... OK, fine. Fine. You win. You could've just said yes earlier. Opera is not for everyone. That was a workout for me. OK, let's talk about our date. Give me your phone please. OK. When such a beauty ask... Phone date. What? Phone date? You weren't specific. Take it or I'll delete my number. Okay. Okay. I'll take it. No calling after 10pm. Hello, Miss Chu? It's LAN, who just moved in 4A. Yes. Anything the problem? Something's wrong with my shower. Can you send someone up to take a look? All right. It'll be about an hour before I can get a plumber up. That's fine. Can you help me by using your key to let the plumber in? Because I won't be back till the evening. Okay, let me handle it. Yeah? Thanks so much. Here. I'll leave it to you. Go and fix the water system inside. I'll be back in about 30 minutes. Please hurry. It's okay, 30 minutes is enough. So beautiful. Give you a kiss! Miss Chu? Landlord Chu? -Was the tenant home? -No, she wasn't home. Yeah? I left for a bit and when I came back, I heard so much noise. Turn out he was dead. What time did you see his body? About 10am. -Honey, why are you not with Aunt Thao? -She's inside talking to a policeman. He's got asthma for years. Okay. Be a good boy and don't be running around. -Where do you want to go? -This is my house. Oh my God, LAN. There you are. I've been so worry about you. Where have you been? My phone's battery was dead. -You must be LAN. -Yes. There was an incident here involving the death of the plumber. We need to inspect your apartment as part of our investigation routine. You will need to find another place to stay for tonight. You can stay with us. Still has plenty of space. What's the reason of his death? Everything is still in investigation, so we can't give you any details. Let's go. Mom, look at my painting. Do you like it? -Oh sweetie, I love it. -Mom, can you color it in for me? Let's do that tomorrow morning sweetie. Now my son must drink some milk. Then go to bed. -You've already promised. -I promise. You're my super kid. Sleep well, my little boy. I don't want to play anymore. You're hurting me. You're hurting me. You're hurting me. Mom! Mom! Mom, wake up! Mom! Mom, wake up! Mom, wake up! Mom! Mom! Mom! No. You can't hurt my mommy! Let her go! She's my mom! You're bad! You lied! You're a bad person! Mom! Mom! Mom! No! You said you were my friend! You promised me! Mommy. She's gone now. You okay? Mom! I'm so scared. LAN... what's going on down here? Just my dream. Don't worry. All right. Try to sleep again. Let's go back to sleep. Bi! You met Miss again last night, did you? Yes, Mom. Do you remember how Miss looks like? I thought you drew Mommy. Vu? Where are you? OK. Let's take a 5-minute-break. You sing better than I thought. That's not my best voice yet. So... what can I help you? There is something weird about this music box. It plays a strange melody. Thought you are an expert in music please do a favor... to look into it for me. Since I had this music box, many strange things have happened OK! I'll see what I can find out. Thank you! I have to go now. Wait! This Saturday night, I'll be performing. And to be specific, you have to dress up. And the important thing is you must be sexy. Sexy. Deal. Let me see This music makes me have goose pumps OK, back to our rehearsal guys Who's that? Who's that? Who's that? Whoever is hiding, better come out here. I'm not scared of you. I shouldn't have talked to you like that. Okay, whoever is hiding, just stay there, don't come out here. This time I'm dead meat. What the bad mouth! LAN! You're Detective Kieu, right? You must find my phone at any cost. It'll be the proof. Understand? Remember what I say now. I'll show you. Do you see that? There's no one playing at the keyboard. But there's still the melody. Evil spirits seemed to be around here. There is something strange. Is anyone there? Help me! Okay! Who are you? Why are you crying? Vu! Open the door! Vu! Vu! Vu! Open the door! Hurry up! I'm coming! Are you okay? I've tried to call you many times. I had such a horrible night. You wouldn't believe what happened. But I recorded all. I saw a lady, she was holding a little fetus. Nothing! That's weird. I swear I recorded her last night. She was here last night. In a red dress, holding a little fetus. This keyboard... No one played it, but there's still a melody... the melody of this music box. Maybe she is trying to tell us something. Whatever she is trying to tell, no need to scare the shit out of me like that. I think I may know who might be able to help us. -Who's that? -It's me, LAN. -Hi! -What's your problem? Actually, there's something I want to ask you. Go ahead. I want to know more about the apartment I'm living. The 4A. Are there any strange things happened there over the last few years? There was a girl who committed suicide before. Not much older than your niece Ngoc. After what happened to the plumber, many people have been thinking about leaving. Do you really believe he died from an asthma attack? Asthma attack was the result, but it was caused by something else. It appeared he was running away from something. Let's get it straight. Has anyone ever mentioned bout seeing spirits here or nearby? Surely you know something. Tell me. Not everything in our life is explainable. Sometimes you just have to accept it. I didn't have time to cook. Please have instant noodle instead. -What makes you so nervous? -Nothing at all. I hate it when Quyen works overtime and doesn't come home. Where's Ngoc? Staying overnight at a friend's house. Since you moved in this apartment, -you've been acting... -What? Say it. No, that's not what I mean, but... You think I'm more and more crazy, right? You're the one who strongly believe all of these spirit matters. I'm the skeptical and rationale one, remember? The landlord told me about recent accidents in the building. Maybe they're all coincidences. While I am crazy. But don't you think if I'm not crazy, the story is even more scary? Here it is. LAN! What happened? Thao. Thao. Thao, open the door. Thao, please open. What happened? Open the door. Hey sister... About last night... I'm really worried about you. I don't know what's happening. I'm OK. Just take care of yourself. I'm going out tonight. Going out? Staying home all day doesn't help me anything at all. Agree. You should spend a night out to relax. Can you watch out Bi for me please? Of... of course, just go out and have fun. You're too holed up in that apartment. Thanks a lot. -What should I get for you? -Whiskey, neat. OK. Mi? I'm sorry. I thought you were someone else. Thank you. I have something to tell you. I met a music producer earlier, he seemed to be interested in my music. Congratulations. -To music. -Thanks. Two more please. So excited! Your song is so attractive. So... am I attractive? You fool. But cute. Wanna get out of here? To where? Let's have something special. Special? Yeah, let's go. What? Nothing. Wait. Wait for me a little bit dear Work these muscles to get everything. Work these muscles and get LAN. The ball is ready in front of the goal gate. So the last mission is to score. Gotta score. LAN? LAN. LAN? Could you open the door? LAN? LAN. LAN? LAN. LAN? LAN! Vu! LAN. What happened? Vu, open the door! Open up! Hurry! Vu! Vu! Help! Help me! Help! Anybody, help! Help! Anybody, help! Help me! Help! Open the door! Who are you? Who are you? Who are you? What do you want? What do you want? What is this? What? What is this? Stop! Stop, please! Stop! Stop! Stop, please! Stop! Stop! What are you doing here? Mind if I come in? What happened here? I don't think it's been that bad What are you talking about? Never mind. I... I just wanted to check in on you. I miss you. Check in on me? For what? I'm just concerned about you. You called me a few times and... Did you think that I called? It's Bi who called you. -He missed his father. -Bi? Bi called me? -This is too much LAN. -LAN? What happened, babe? -Hey, who are you? -I should be the one who asks. -This is none of your business, Cuong. -None of my business? You're still my legal wife. This is a misunderstanding. Nothing happened between me and LAN yet. -This is unbelievable! -Unbelievable? Don't turn the table on me. You're the one who cheated on me... You slept with your secretary. Don't you remember? I've... I've already told you... I... You know what, it doesn't matter anymore. Maybe... this is none of my business. May I? You two... just go ahead. Why are you still here? LAN! You should leave. -LAN! -Get out! THE BURIAL THE DENIED FETUS She was in a red dress, holding a little fetus. THE KILLER Asthma attack was the result, but it was caused by something else. It appeared he was running away from something. THE LOVE AFFAIR THE HIDDEN SECRET Maybe she is trying to tell me something. Vu! -What? -Come here. M and X. Xung, owner of this building, last night, he called me Mi. Do you think this is the same person? How could it not be? M and X. Mi and Xung. What will we do? What time does Xung go to the bar? Normally he comes in around 8 or 9PM. Meet me outside of Xung's house at 8:00 PM tonight. -Cheers. -Let's drink! I'm so relieved to kick that guy out. Cheers to that! -Mom, what are you looking for? -My kit. -What's it for? -Find out the truth. Now go, my boy. -To Auntie Thao's? -Good boy. Hope that he's not home. He's now having fun with girls in the bar. -Where did you get that? -From my closet. Why did you have it? Are you sure you've read all my books? Cheers. -How many cans... -I can't remember. Whatever. Let's drink. Excuse me, ladies. -This is for you. -Sorry, we didn't order wine. This is from my boss. I'll leave it here for you. It's broken. Right when I need it most. Make use of time. What are we looking for? Anything suspicious. Such a clear mission! -Look for anything with the name Mi on it, okay? -It's better. Cheers! I don't understand... boys and men. How come they're never satisfied? Why do they always think... they can find something better, even when they have something great? Don't need to worry. You're still young. You have plenty of time. Okay, last shot for the night. Okay, let's go home. I'm so tired. Ngoc's already got drunk. I'll take her home. As I also need to get back to my apartment. -Are we home yet? -Not yet, baby. Did you find anything? There's nothing here. Vu! Come here. Do you feel something strange about this painting? Yeah! She's staring at me, don't you see? Give me a hand. What is this? It's definitely Mi. My home, finally. Yes, your home. Come this way to your home. Maybe he's just curious. Why do you need to hide them if you're just curious? He must have involved somehow. Maybe he even killed her. What? You really think Xung is that much evil? This is not my home. Yes, it is. This is your home, babe. Hey, not there. This isn't my place. This is your place, sweetie. Tonight, you will be mine. Who is still calling at this time? Mommy. Your mommy is calling. Mom... mom. Your mom has nothing to do here. She didn't answer. I'm so worried. Let's go find her. What are you doing? Get away from me! Get away from me! Auntie LAN! Please open the door! Help me! Auntie! Where do you want to go? Okay, we're clear. What? Ngoc. Ngoc? What happened? Ngoc! -Ngoc. -Somebody help us, please. -What happened to you? -Call an ambulance. It should be Thao's voice. -Ngoc! -Call an ambulance. Ngoc! Please wake up! Ngoc Hello? Is this emergency department? I need an ambulance immediately, Block F, Van Xung building. Ngoc, can you hear me? Don't leave me, please. Ngoc! Please wake up! Ngoc! Please stay out of our way. I'm sorry. You have to wait outside. -My daughter! -Calm down, honey! You can wait over there. Thanks. How is my daughter doing, Doctor? Fortunately, she is in stable condition now. She had high alcohol level in her blood. So I assume... ...she probably tripped over and banged her head. However, everything will be fine. Thank you, Doctor. I'm gonna stay the night here. LAN, you should go home. Okay, I'll go home. But you have to call me if anything happens. Amitabha Buddha. Amitabha Buddha. Miss Chu. I'm sure that you know everything. Something isn't right with this building and you know it. I hoped it would fade with time, but since you moved in, things have been more and more serious. I've kept this secret for a while. -What secret? -The music box I gave you. I sense there is a spirit following and protecting it. That spirit has not been able to cross over. Is it the spirit of Mi? I don't know who she is. But if there is something that belongs to her, we might be able to ask her. As far as I know, they come in two forms. There are those who don't want to cross over, because they want to stay close to their beloved relatives, What about the other form? The other form, they are stuck here. They're willing to do whatever it takes to cross over. In order to be successful in asking her, you must concentrate and think about her. Gods of Heaven and Earth... Gods of Heaven and Earth... She's here. Tell her I want to help. She has a pain, like you. So I know what she feels. -She wants to end something... -Xung... -Xung... -with Xung. She wants vengeance. But still, she won't be appeased. -Then what else does she want us to do? -Find my body... Her body. Find her body, ensure that she receives a proper burial. She has been suffering with terrible things. Find her body, bury it and only then can she rest. But you have to hurry. The music box kept her in check, but since it's broken, she's been doing more unimaginable things. Now she's reckless. I understand. But you have kept this music box for a long time. Why didn't you know anything about this? She didn't believe me. But you, you have something that makes her trust you. It's the reason why she wants to talk to you. What would Detective Kieu be doing now? Let's break down the whole place. Just kidding. Mom, mom, come here with me. -What's up, sweetie? -Hurry, mom. Mom, hurry up. -What is it? -The sound is different here. -Really? -Yeah. Vu! Come and hear. Something must be under this floor. -Go find some tools. -Okay. Get off me. Get off me now. Get off. Go to hell, bitch! Mom has some important things to do. Come to Auntie Thao's home, son. After finishing this business, mom will play with you. -Promise? -I promise. Ladies first. Someone is hammering loudly on the 4th floor. -Who is doing that? -Apartment 4A. No! No! They can't do that! Keep going! I'm sure you are down here. I will find you. Vu! Run! What do you want to do? -Do you wanna die? -You buried her here, didn’t you? Who told you dig it up? I'll kill you. Go to hell! Go to hell! Finally, you're awake. This must be even more interesting. You look beautiful in this dress. So beautiful. What's that? What I can't hear... After tonight, no one can hear either. After tonight, you and the fool over there... will disappear forever... like Mi. It's because of your curiosity. Do you want to know how Mi died? I'll let you know. Why did you dare go against me? Bitches who dare go against me will have the same fate as yours. No one can rescue you. Dare go against me? You bitch. LAN! What happened to you? Okay! Bitch! Come out here! Come out here, bitch! I... I'm not scared. I'm not scared. Come out here! Where are you? Come out here! Bitch! Come out here! I'll never forgive you! LAN! LAN! I found her! LAN. LAN. LAN, wake up! Wake up! LAN. LAN. What happened? I found her! The body is down there. I found her. Vu. Vu. "Few Weeks Later" Are you leaving now? Yeah. I have to put everything in storage for the next few months. While you're about to become a famous singer. I've been playing in small clubs recently. My producer wants me to go up steps by steps. She's smart. You're going to meet a lot of beautiful women out there. And maybe you'll find happiness with one of them. Maybe. But who know... maybe I'll meet you again later. So where are you going now? Quick stop in town, then I'll continue my journey, looking for fame. Good luck. Thanks. -Mom, hurry up! -It's your turn, Bi. Excellent! Again. -Throw it to me. -Catch it. -For Bi! -For mom. For Bi! -For mom. -Wait, I miss. For Bi! For mom. -Hurry, mommy! -Catch it! -Wait for me to take the ball. -Okay. LAN! It's time, LAN. We need to go. To where? I'm glad that finally you accept the truth. It's very good for you. Do you remember the day... when your whole family celebrated your new book being published. Whoa, Detective Kieu is so popular. Your book is the best-seller now. -Congratulations. -Thanks, honey. Mom, come here, play with me. How about later, Bi? Now you must take a nap. I'll play with you after you wake up, alright? All right. Your husband never had an affair. You only denied the truth because you weren't ready to face it yet. You built up for yourself... a completely different story... to blame your husband. You blamed Cuong because of his obsession in work, so he didn't take care of family, didn't teach Bi how to swim... And... sometimes accidents happened. Mom, mom! Mom. Dad! Dad. Dad! Help me! Help me! Help! Bi, Bi! Then you ill-treated yourself... and lived in your nightmare and obsession. Bi! Bi! Bi! Bi! Bi! Bi! Sister, do you love me? Yes, of course. Did you hear me clearly? Of course I love you. It's Bi who called you. -Is this you, LAN? -He missed his father. Hello? LAN, please say something. LAN! Sleep well, my boy. I miss you, Bi. Mommy! It's okay, mom. I'm so sorry, baby. I never meant... It's not your fault, mom. I would do anything... ...to bring you back. I love you! I didn't mean to. Of course not, you love your son. You both did. But now... ...now you must learn to love yourself.
