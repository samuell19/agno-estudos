Probably got this from a chicken down the road, yeah? He probably knows the chicken's name. You're a limo driver? Am I driving a limo? Yes. Am I a limo driver? No. No. No, I was actually starting a business driving limos, and I bought four at auction, and when I went to pick 'em up, they were these '90s pieces of shit you saw, right? You know, worn-out leather, no TV. It's like, "How am I gonna rent these? I can't rent 'em out." And I couldn't, right? So, I call the guy, and I'm like, "Listen, this is not what I ordered from-- from the catalog." And he just takes the bill of sale and he's like, "You can just go kiss your own ass."

[dealer breathing shakily] [Vic] You know... [shaky breathing continues] ...we killed this kid. My guy pulled the trigger. But he's my responsibility. [dealer crying] [Vic] That kid... was yours. Look, I don't know what you want me to say, Vic. Do you want me to say I killed him? Fine, I killed him. I already told you everything I know, man. All right? I told you it was fucking Tarrow and those guys. They're the ones who hit the airport, not me. What about the pink? Okay, look, this is gonna sound kind of fucked, but there's talk of this guy, this old guy. He's going around town with some of the pink. He calls himself "the Baker." -The Baker? -Yeah. Who is this Baker? I don't know who the Baker is, Vic, I swear. That's all I know. Okay, please, please don't kill me. [crying] Come on. Please don't kill me. I need your help to send a message. No, no, no! Don't! [gunshot] [groaning] Tell... fucking... everyone. The Merchant wants what's his.

[cell phone buzzing] Yeah? [Rispoli] Peter Stanton, born April 17th, 1983. I need the father. Can't do it. [Weintrager] What do you mean you can't? It's redacted. Who the fuck is this guy? [sirens wailing in distance] You stay in the truck, no matter what. All right? You keep the doors locked until I get back. Don't open them for anybody. Promise me. [metal music playing] -[bong bubbles] -[music continues] [teenager 1] What? -[teenager 2] Don't take me on. -[thuds] -Where is it, man? -Yo. What the fuck? -Yo. What the fuck? -[teenager 2] Where? Look at me. -Where? -[teenager 1] What? Back off, man. [teenager 1] The fuck are you-- [teenager 2] Give it back. [teenager 1] How many times I gotta-- -I didn't do shit. -[teenager 2] How many-- -[knock at door] -Who is it? The fuck? -[grunts] -[the Baker] Shh. I'll do all the talking. Shh. There's $300 in that box out there. Tell me what I want to know, it's all yours. Who the fuck are you, bro? Where is Peter Stanton? Who? I don't know Peter, man. He called you three days ago. Oh, you are so fucking dead old man. I'm gonna fucking-- [screams] -Seriously. -[teenager 1] Fuck, man. -It's only 20 bucks. -Pay up, man. [teenager 2] Fuck me. [panting, whimpering] I don't fucking know where he is, man. Fuck! You got a lot of piercings, son. -And I got a lot of time. -No! Wait. Wait a second. Okay, I know Pete. Okay. He buys weed off me, some-fucking-times, and he buys E off me, sometimes. That's it, bro. He called you about this, right? I mean-- I-- Okay, listen. Listen, he called me. He said he had a bunch of pink that he wanted me to move up. I said I'd kick it up the ladder. That's all. -Up to who? -Sirko. My fucking supplier. He owns this nightclub called Lily's. A big guy, Ukrainian, weird fucking teeth. -[door opens] -[Delfi panting] -Goggles! -[Delfi whimpers] -[grunting] -[glass smashing] [Milky screaming, grunting] [both panting] I said stay in the goddamn truck, didn't I? You promised! You could've been killed. We need to eat. No. You don't do that. Never again. [Pete] That's my baby girl. [grunts] [knocking at door] [knocking continues] [knocking continues] [banging on door] [loud banging on door] Hey. Your lawn needs watering. You have to take care of these things. Okay. Ian. James. Um... -Last night... -[Merchant] I heard. I heard. You were shaky. Shaky isn't dependable, Vic. I know, what you do, it's hard. Old men wage their little wars, but it's the young men who fight them. You used to spoil for a fight, Vic. But now not so much. We change. What do you want now? Forgiveness? No. I'm fine. You look worried. Worried about what? What's already in the past? What God might think? Well, I'm pretty sure God's made up his mind about me. Don't worry about the God who has already condemned you. Worry about the man in your kitchen... who has yet to make up his mind. I need you dependable, Vic. I'm dependable. We'll see. Your dad, he didn't like mushrooms either. One time-- I guess your father was around your age-- I took him mushroom hunting. I used to like that. It cleared my head. Anyway, I gave him this bell, you know, like the kind you might put around a goat's neck, and I says to him, and I says to him, "Look, if you get lost, you ring the bell. I'll come find you." So anyway, I set off into the woods, and, man, it must have been my lucky day, 'cause I'm finding mushroom after mushroom. I'm filling my bag, and all of a sudden, I realize I don't see your father anywhere. So I started calling out his name... nothing. So now I start retracing my steps. Nothing. Now, I'm starting to imagine having to tell your grandmother I lost our kid in the woods. [sighs] Anyway... I get back to where we started, and there he is. Just sitting there, playing with some lizard he found. And I was so relieved, I forgot how furious I was, but I said to him, "Why didn't you ring the bell?" You know what he said? "I wasn't lost." Anyway... he didn't like mushrooms either. "It was fortunate the Tin Woodman had no heart at that moment, for it would have beat loud and fast from terror. But being only tin, the Woodman was not at all afraid." [motorbike engine roars] [trance music playing] [bartender] What do you need? [speaks Ukrainian] [bartender] Right away. [bartender] Cheers. [grunts] [speaks Ukrainian] Motherfucker! [in Ukrainian] - Kopyshche. - Da. [Sirko] Dobre. [groaning, grunting] [grunting continues] [both shouting] [thuds] [in English] Who the fuck are you? I'm looking for my son. And who the fuck is your son? So you're the old man. "The Baker." There is ten grand bounty on your head. And you're the guy that's gonna collect it, right? I will not kill you for money. [grunting] [screams] [grunting, groaning continues] [groaning] [groaning] Where's my son? [grunts] Your son is dead. You've seen the body? I helped to bury him. Who killed him? Your son killed himself. [screaming] [screams] [shouts in Ukrainian] [gurgling, choking] We're done here. It's over. What? [crying] Chances he's alive are... I don't know. It's over. -Hey. Hey. -[whimpering] Hey! -Hey. Calm down. -[crying] Calm down. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. Look at me. You see this? You see this long hand? See how slow and steady it moves? -Watch it. Watch it. -[crying continues] Look at me. Look at me. Look at me. Look at me. Look at me. Look at me. Look at me. Breathe. Breathe. Look at the long hand. Look at it. Look at it. You're okay. You're okay. You're okay. Good girl. We gotta leave in the morning. Bright and early. [officer] Yeah, no. Do you recall anything? -[witness 1] I didn't see any-- -Yeah. Just shots, like pop, pop. -[Weintrager] You see that? -[Rispoli] Yep. That's Sirko. 1:14 a.m. Four minutes later... I ran this frame by frame a few times. No clear face shot. He knew where the cameras were. -Let me know if you find anything else. -Yeah. [cell phone buzzes] [birds chirping] [grunts] Your grandmother's name was Delfi. Did you know that? You also have her... tight way of smiling. Let's go home. Okay? Hey. You pack up. I'm gonna go around the corner, get some stuff for the road. Maybe some real coffee. You want some? [phone rings] [elevator dings] Hey. I think I just found your baker. Have you seen this guy? [breathes deeply] [elevator dings] -[knock at door] -[gasps] -[gunman 1] Anything? -No. Clear. [whistles] Got something. -Fuck. -Go. Fuck! [gunman 2] Open the door! Open the door! Hey! Open the door! Hey! [gunman 1] Hey. Come on. [whimpering] -[grunts] -[cracks] [groaning, grunting] [gunshots] [grunting, groaning continues] [cracks] Hey, brat. Not yet. Not yet.
