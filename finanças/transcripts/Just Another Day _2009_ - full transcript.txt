[sirens wailing at a distance] ♫ Wake up Wake up ♫ ♫ Ah get up Get up get up ♫ (woman) Wassup, Miami? Hope you are having a great morning so far. You are listening to JAM 95. 1, southern Florida's number one hip hop station. It's me, lady T, and l gotta get into this 41 1. Because late last night in downtown Miami, it was a hot one. The ongoing beef between rappers A-Maze and B-Bone apparently, that boiled over. It ended up in a scuffle at the Tropical Heat night club. The altercation resulted in a shooting that left one of B-Bone's associates in critical condition. There was also a drug related slaying in the Triangle late last night, too. Authorities fear that the shooting may have been a result of the ongoing drug war between rival Haitian gangs. In other Hip Hop news, Ja Rule, he's in town this week. To promote his new album, M irror Reloaded, he'll be performing... [knocking at door] Rise 'n' shine. Come on. We gotta get movin'. We got a lot to do today. We gotta do the photo shoot. And after that we got the marketing meeting. Then we got the in-store at Del South Records in North M iami. What we doing at in-store for? For the label. lt's some promotion shit, l guess. What promotion we gonna do? We ain't got no album. lt ain't comin' out for months. I don't know. Don't ask me, man. They got their reasons, you know. What else we gotta do? We got the lunch meeting with the movie people, Selahsi's video shoot, then it's the show at H2O tonight. Oh, and l set the meeting for the label, too. What about? You know that kid, Young Eastie, l was telling you about? Shit, he's fresh. I'm telling you. I'm ready to go back to fuckin' bed. Are you crazy? l just told you we we've got a full day. I got so much goin' on in my head, too, man. Anthony shouldn'ta shot that cat. I know. Look, we just gotta move on, put it behind us like we always do. You know what l mean?

He done started some shit he can't finish now. But dude, guess what? It's on him, not us. Man. You stick around, man. These motherfuckers, all they do is act like goddamn fools and run up the bar tab like a motherfucker. And guess what, man? l ain't going to motherfuckin' jail dude, l mean it. L'd rather fuckin' die. [radio switches on with hip-hop music] [hip-hop music] (Mom) Where's my pills? Where's my pills? You ready for school? What's that? What you saying? Nothing, Ma. You seen my pills? My back is acting up again. Here ya go, Ma. Thank you, baby. You're welcome. L'ma need a refill soon. M h-hm. And l heard them helicopters last night.

We need to take this seriously, Antoine. I'm taking it seriously, dude. I took it seriously last night when l was in a pissy ass fucking cell. I took it real seriously. l was in that bitch all night. Where was you at? I'm usually not up that late. Look motherfucker, l'm not giving you a retainer for your beauty sleep. We gotta go. My guess is they'll wanna pin a lesser charge on you. Perhaps conspiracy to commit murder. What? Conspiracy. Man, l didn't do shit. l'm sitting there with a hot blonde. I'm sipping on my drink and we're having a good motherfucking time. A motherfucker l ain't never ever seen before gonna come up to me and throw shit in my face? Hell, yeah, Anthony did what he had to do, man. That's how that shit go down. l didn't have to tell him to do shit. It'd be best if you keep a low profile for a while, that's all l'm saying. You hear this motherfucker? I'm going on tour for two weeks and this dude's telling me about a low profile. I warned you. Did you see Shark Week, when it was on TV, the cable thing? They're talking about sharks, telling you everything about sharks. When a sharks stops swimming, they drown. Okay? l gonna keep it moving, Dave. l'm gonna keep it moving. That's what l'm trying to tell you. I need you to sign one more thing. Nah, man, give it to Gary. All right, dude. [muffled hip-hop music coming from car] What up, boy? What's good, baby? Ain't nothin'. We gotta get that demo from Tyrone. Yeah, he want that bread though. How much you talking? $ 1,500. 1,500? Jay, you gotta talk him down, man. I mean, l can do it, ain't nothing. Nah, serious, man, because you know l got that meeting with A-Maze and Gary. Jay, this is serious, man. I know it's serious. Come on. What you gonna do? You gonna do the same thing? Bro, we gotta go to work. We late. Come on, man. Trippin', man. Shit. Good morning, good morning, good morning. Good morning. Welcome to Lalo's. May l take your order, please? Yeah. l'd like a coffee, a morning bacon sandwich, and can l get a side of that green potato salad? Uh, right. Um, please, drive around. Bacon sandwich with cheese. How you doing, sir? That'll be two-fifty. Thank you, sir. And enjoy your green potato salad. (photographer) Sexy in the eyes. A-Maze, right in the camera. Girls. Sexy, sexy. Turn your shoulders in. Shoulders into me. Arching the backs. Asses out. Asses out. Girls, relax. Relax. A little more, get into each other. No, get him to loosen up, not the girls. Hey, l've tried everything except a cattle prod. Can you get this going, dude? A-Maze, relax. These are your bitches. I'm trying, man l get tired. Come on, you're the king of the hood, man. I'm shuffling my feet 'cause they hurt. Stay with me. I've been posing for a long time. l'm hot. I know. All right. Let's take ten. Let's take ten. You look great. Oh, no, no, no, nah, l need you to go on over there. You'd fit right in there. One shot. Gary, don't you wanna see her in... You wanna see her in one of those numbers. Stop bullshitting. You wanna see it. Thank you. Okay, yes. (Joannie) Hey boys. How're you doing? Let me see what you doing. Excuse you. Give me this. Okay, you know what? You really shouldn't be reading my messages. It's only journalists looking for a statement. Well, the problem is that statement comes out, and it stirs up this pot with this beef, and it fucks me up. No, because all of it can play our way, okay? 50 Cent got huge sales off his beef with Jarule. Tupac, Biggie, all of it parlayed into record sales. That's the angle l'm working with. Okay, Ja Rule, first of all is the dude's name. And your first mistake is, 50 Cent took nine bullet holes. Tupac and Biggie? Dead. I can't remember the last time that l heard about a publicist lying face-down in the gutter. I've already prepared a press release. Take a look. All right. So it says that B-Bone is at fault. And then what? And then the press gets hungry and they start scavenging around. And l've already sent it out. You know, sometimes l think l shouldn't be watching my back for these hood mo'fuckers. Really it's you, Joanie, and people like you that scare me more. It's good that l scare you. It'll keep you on your toes. A-Maze! We're back on the clock. Let's go, man. Okay, go get 'em, tiger! Thank you, sir. That'll be 22 .50. Yeah, fool. L'll see you on the other side. You already know we do to that, too. Ha-ha. What was that all about? I don't know. Jay. Fuckin' Roman's at the window, dog. Who? Roman. Fuck. (Bowman) You guys got five minutes. Don't push it. What up, Raff? What up, bro? That's right. There you go, there. Aw, man. You know what? We gonna have to change our business location, man. I can't take this motherfucker rolling up on us like that. It's his thing. He be eyeing. He ain't gunning for you. He ain't got no reason to. He ain't got to have no reason to get at you, you know. That's just what he do. He got killing in his blood, bro. You talking all superstitious. Like he the devil or somethin'. He ain't the devil, but l just don't wanna be on his bad side. You know what l'm saying? The object of his attention. Yeah, man. Yo, you spoke with Tyrone, right? And what he said that we still owe him some money for that demo? I mean, yeah, that what he said. But l can always talk him down. Nah. Don't even talk him down. Let me call him and talk to him. I want you to call Gary up and act like my manager. Manager? You mean your producer? Producer, whatever you wanna do. Just make sure it sound real professional and l'll call Tyrone. Yeah, let's do it. Gary. Tyrone. Wassup, man? Yeah. This is Young Eastie. This is Jay. Young Eastie's producer. Yeah, you know, l'm trying to connect with you to come pick that demo up, man. I know we short on cash, l know that. But we need it right now and l'll get the cash to you later on. No, seriously, l promise that. Yeah, we know where Del South Records at. Course we do. But l kinda really need it tonight. We gonna be there. Yeah, one hundred. All right man, yeah. Shit. Can you believe this motherfucker just now told me we can't get the demo? Man, fuck that shit, man. They want you to come see A-Maze, Del South records, 1:00 PM today. You serious? I swear to God. You now your boy got it. What you gonna do? Let's check the bank account. That's what we gotta do. How much you got? Going into pockets now. I got one-forty. What you got? One-forty? l got a little something like that. That look like more than enough right there. Nah, this ain't enough. Look, this right here is the business account, right? This' like $ 1,600. And this right here's the personal checking account. lt's 850. We got a business account? Yeah. Shit, look like we gonna have to go into the business account, dude. Nah, we can't touch that. l got that from Green. He gave us the package, that granddaddy cush. And l ain't trying to fuck up that connect. So, l don't wanna dip into this money. So, you know what? Let me get that right there. Let me get that money. We gotta get another hustle on, but here's what l need you to do right now. Call me in two minutes. Two minutes. Just trust me. You're gonna find out what we're gonna do right now. (Bowman) l hired you 'cause l like you. But you can't just come in any time you want to. Why do black people think 9:00 is 1 1:00? You've been late everyday this week. And you're gonna have to wear a hairnet. I can't have weave hairs in the food. l'm just telling you. You don't wanna wear a hairnet, you're gonna have to get fired. All your little fat ass friends coming here eatin' for free, that ain't gonna happen. And you taking advantage of it. Excuse me? Damn, are you serious? This what happened right now? What's up with you, young fella? 'Scuse me. Uh, you know my little sister, Tasha. She ate some peanuts and now all of the sudden her whole neck is swollen up. Look, you got a family emergency. Go ahead take care of it. Family come first. Bowman, thank you so much. This is a huge favor. l promise you l will fill in the hours. Just get going. Handle your business. Okay, l'm available. Back to you, young lady. l was hoping this evening we could probably catch dinner. I'm just saying. l'm giving you more than l'm giving the rest of these girls. I'm just saying. All right, l'm done. You can go. I like that ass. Hey, y'all better get the fuck out the way before we end up hittin' one of y'all. (Ro-Bo) Yo, y'all about to fall back. Come on. What happened to that receptionist last time we was here? (Gary) Now they got my man up front. That isn't very welcoming. Fucking place looks like it's shrinking. Posters. Yeah, that's cool. I've got better posters than that. I look tired in that motherfucker. (Gary) Platinum plaques, baby. (Ro-Bo) Still room for a couple more. Philip. lt's my man. l ain't seen you in a minute man. Can l get you gentlemen anything? Nah, we're good. L'll take one of these. Yeah. So what's up? Where Clay at? Clay's not gonna be here today. What you mean Clay not here today, man? You knew l was coming to see him. I got the email that said that you and Clay were gonna be here at the meeting. You all know how things can get for Clay. Love that new track, by the way. We've been playing it 9:00 AM, non-stop. Yeah, that's cool. Don't wear it out. I think we should lead off the album with that. I think l should finish my album. That's something we need to talk about. Clay wants to move the release date up. That's bullshit. Hell, no. Listen, we're thinking we can leak a track onto the lnternet. Perhaps tie it in with a video piece that looks sort of homemade like it was shot on a cell phone or something. That way it can be downloaded and then all over the place so that nobody buys the album. It won't get downloaded all over the place. The album will be released weeks later. The l nternet's the swap meet of the world, man. We can send a track out the next couple of weeks and get some traction on the album. Wait a minute and you listen to this, dude. Since you didn't hear me the first time real good, it ain't done, yet! It can be done. I'm in the studio right now! l'ma talk louder so Dr. Phil over here can hear me! It ain't done, yet! It can be done. l hear the tracks are ready to master. I ain't making no bootleg shit though, dude. Of course. l know that. But it's really time to move, A-Maze. You don't understand. Yo, you make music? You make music? Nah, you don't, you don't. You work for Clay, nigger. I wanna see Clay. Where the fuck is Clay at? Clay's right here. Yo, what's up with my release date, man? He's telling me shit l don't want to hear, man. (Clay) Let me talk to him for a minute. It's cool man. Let us holla. I'm right behind you all. (Gary) Hey, Phil, Phil. Hold on for a second. Y'all pull the car around out front, all right? Can l talk to you for a second? What the fuck is this all about? Well, because it's you, l'm gonna act like you didn't just use the word fuck in my presence. And that's just gonna give you arthritis. So, you wanna know what the fuck this is all about? Yeah, l mean, l don't really get called to be in your presence all that much. Yeah, we should spend more time together. And you do need my advice. Yeah, but l still got a problem with changing my release date. To be honest, you're the problem right now. I mean, the last album, it didn't even go gold. And we gotta to make something happen in the market place. I see. So you talking about dropping me from the label? Would l do that to an old friend? I'm saying 'cause l'm ready to go. Drop me, l'm ready to go. L'll just take my masters with me and go make my own shit happen. While you're at it, why don't you just pull a Tina Turner and ask to keep my last name? I know you're busy and everything, but when you get a second, l just wanna talk to you about the label me and Maze are putting together. You got my number? Yeah, yeah, l've got your number, but what l really wanna do is, l wanna get you the CD of this new kid that we're signing first. He's fresh. Fresh! Can't wait to hear it. Call me. L'll call you. It's fresh. Why release now? Because you generated a lot of heat last night. And we can capitalize on it. That's all well and good, but l'm not finished with the album, yet. lt's not ready. I think you might just be worrying a little too much. Somebody around this motherfucker gotta worry about something. All the pressure is really on me. From what l heard, the album is fire, man. Back to the old you. Listen, remember l told you, l'm like Don King. I can get you with any and everybody in the ring. But it's up to you to win the fight. Let me just do my job. The meeting is over, man. This piece of shit. Tyrone. Brought my money? Money? What you talking about? For what? We already paid for the session. l just need a demo. I got nothin' to say to you. l had to mix and master that shit. That shit's extra. No, Jay mixed it and mastered it. Pushing sliders doesn't constitute mixing a track, okay? He had me fix his mixes after you left. Whoa, wait, wait, listen, listen, listen. Okay, we got a meeting today. And l mean it, it is huge. You see the kind of cats l'm rolling with right now, right? This is your chance to be part of the dream. This is serious. l mean, shit is gonna happen. I get a chance to be part of the dream? This is what l'll do. l'm gonna take your dream and l'm gonna take my 1,500. How 'bout that? When you get the money, you come holla at me. It's business. Nothing personal, bro. A'ight? All right. (Keisha) Coming. L'll be right there. [romantic music] Where've you been out all these weeks? Things, you know? I thought we had something poppin' though. We do have something poppin'. I take care of my shit, don't l? This taking care of shit? What? Why would you say that? I handle my business, don't l, babe? Come on, you know. What's the problem? E, this isn't enough! It ain't ever enough. Whatever. Your baby with your moms? Uh-huh. So what else is it you really want, E? You don't ever just stop by. Keisha, you believe in me? Yeah. So l'ma keep it a hundred then with you. I need to borrow some money. What? I knew it. No, listen. l promise you l'll pay you back with interest. Fuck it. Smile for me, baby. Don't be a stranger. Naw, the one with the donk, remember the... Yo, Roman. lsn't that that dude that deals for Green? Yeah, the little punk-ass from Lalo's. You got some l D on you? No, l don't have any l D on me, sir. That bitch better not be talkin' about what he saw last night. Yeah, l'm gonna have to have a word with his bitch-ass a little later, too. This chump looks like a snitch, Roman. [hip-hop music played in car] Bo, turn that shit down, dude. It's kinda fresh. l like the rhyme on this joint. What's wrong with ou? You hungry? No. We can stop off at this chicken place and get some take-out. (Ro-Bo) The place with the double-fried extra crispy? Yes, with the hot sauce, with the French fries underneath, bread be soggy. Yo, y'all motherfuckers need to stop thinkin' with y'all guts, man. We're going to the signing. Fuck the chicken. I'm just saying, if you're hungry, we could stop and get some for later. I hear you, but stop thinking about all this little shit all the time. We out here tryin' to do business. Don't nothing else really even matter. What you gonna do with a double extra-crispy number three with sesame seeds and shit you ain't even got no money to buy it with. I was just tryin' to look out for you, but whatever. Stay focused. Oh shit! Gun it! Gun it! Get down, man! [gunshots] Where he at? Oh, shit. They right on us. They followin'. Why the fuck they chasin' us? They bust a cap in the broad daylight. Drive! Go, go! Fuck! Stay down! He gone, fuck! Get the fuck outta here, nigga! That motherfucker shot at us! What kinda shit is that? Gary, pull that motherfuckin' phone out and call Roman right now. (Roman) Yeah. Yo, Roman, what up? It's Gary. Maze's boy. What's up, fool? We was just talkin' about you. We don't see you round here much no more. Yeah, l know. But look, we gotta talk. Maze is in some shit. I got it, l got it. Yo, Roman, you heard what's up with me, right? Shit, who ain't heard? Your business is all in the streets. Yeah, l need a real motherfuckin' favor. I got you. What's up? I need some friends, you know what l'm sayin'? Don't worry. You got plenty of friends right here. l'm your friend. That's what's up. You know l'm gonna look out for you. I got you, ain't nuttin'. So fill Gary in, what need to go down. Dat. A'ight. Yo, it's gettin' hot, man. Tyrone! Yo, Tyrone! Who is it? It's Eastie. You fuckin' marked up my wall. No, l didn't. Yes, you did. That's your motherfucking tag. It wasn't me. l just came to get the CD. You got my money? Yeah, l got the money. Motherfucker, you're gonna clean that shit off my wall, bro. I didn't do it. You did that shit. You know how long it took me to get that shit the way it's at now? I didn't do it. That's your tag! No, it's not. It's your motherfucking tag. I just came for my demo.

All right. l got no battle rap, but l see y'all pullin up in the black Cadillac, two dudes, guns in hand, y'all are tellin' me l gotta rap. Y'all put me on the spot? To see if l'm hot? Like a chick given brains l go off the top. This motherfucker ain't too bad. Matter of fact, l need goons for security op. Real talk l don't claim no set. I'm nothin' but a rapper tryin' to get that check. Hey, yo boss, man! Why we going through all this trouble, man? Maze is washed up, he ain't even got a new album out or nothin'. It doesn't matter. He's still a name. Plus, business is hurtin'. This promotion's gonna be beneficial. Yeah, especially after he shot some nightclub up man. Ain't nothin' like the smell of death to bring out the dogs. We should be getting danger money for this man. I'm putting my life on the line, they're gonna come in here... Look, all you gotta do is be cool and sell some records, okay? [jumbled voices] How you doin', man? Actually l'm a part of A-Maze's crew. No, l got a meeting with Gary. What's your name? Young Eastie. I ain't got no Young Easton on this list. It ain't on the list. l'm here to meet Gary. l gotta get the demo to him. You gotta go to the back like everybody else. [all talk at a time] [people cheer] This place is an ambush. You see that?

L'll just explain to you later. That's what it is. Did you see it? You see his face? That nigger was shook. We goin' to the club. Get in, man, hurry, hurry. That's the shit l'm talkin' about. That's the shit we gonna capture on wax. The timing is now. lt's right now. And he sees it! But fuck him! Maze, l'm talking about Clay! So you're sayin' we're gonna sign, we want him to sign me now? It's the label we got together. lt's gonna be fresh! [gunshots] Yo, Maze! Fuck! I need an ambulance. Please. Fuckin' right now! Well. There it is. Your contract. Now, before you sign this, l want you to take a minute to think, because l know this is what you've been dreaming of all your life. But, son, some dreams become nightmares. When you sign this, your life is no longer your own. There'll be cousins that you never seen at any family reunion. Chicks that can't even get pregnant, calling Maury Povich. Friends that agree with whatever the fuck you saying just as long as you picking up the check. Cats waiting for you to give them a stimulus package. And relatives that have been there since day one, who always knew little Eastie was gonna make something out of himself. And that's not even counting the haters, the critics, little knuckleheads that's trying to step to you, runnin' up on you. Now, if you can deal with all that, hm. Sign. But if you have the slightest doubt in your mind, and l mean the slightest, then we can end this meeting right now. [music l Know How You Feel] [music Just Another Day]
