Who would ever have imagined we'd make it to the finals when we started thinking about our Azzurri Dream? That we would share the emotions, the fears, the suffering, the joy, of a journey that would end up in European heaven. This is the story of a group of brothers, led by a man who saw in them something no one else saw. Their quality, their strength, their determination, their desire. A leader who taught his group never to give up. And to keep pushing forward with a smile. That's how they won. And we were there to record everything that's never shown on television, but which is behind every play, every goal, every victory. And this evening we can tell you, in a way no one's done before, about the path to Wembley. Make a nice documentary, film, whatever it is, about everything that's happened. We're guys like you, we're normal guys, and we've dreamed and screamed along with you for this great national team. WEMBLEY STADIUM - LONDON Dear listeners, this might be the decisive penalty kick. This might be the decisive penalty kick. It will probably be Jorginho to shoot, the ball is already on the penalty spot. Pickford is walking around nervously again. Jorginho's run-up is about to begin. There's a lot of tension, obviously. The referee's blown the whistle, Jorginho's running up, he shoots and, goal! No, he blocked it! Incredible, Pickford blocked it. Pickford blocked it. Pickford blocked it. Pickford blocked it. Incredible, Pickford blocked it. Now there's… There's a chance for the English to tie it up. Saka's up, he's going to shoot the English's fifth penalty shot with his left foot. He gives himself a short run-up as well, the referee's whistle, Saka's running up, he's shooting… We did it! We did it! We are the European champions! At 11:54 p.m. in Italy. Italy are the European champions for the second time in history! Donnarumma blocked it! An Italian flag is flying on Europe's roof! The tears of the Azzurri, who've achieved the best possible result. We've won! We're the best! And this time, it's definitive! We're the European champions! ONE MONTH EARLIER For the first time, a European championship that will stop in many countries of the Old Continent, from Spain to Azerbaijan. A huge football field, approached by 26 teams who want to perform on the Wembley stage. Roberto Mancini's Azzurri also hope to get there, to celebrate victory in a European championship for the second time, after that remote, revolutionary 1968 in Rome so long ago. FRIDAY 11 JUNE TWO HOURS BEFORE ITALY - TURKEY Guys, three things, quickly. I wanted to thank you and the coach for bringing us this far, in the name of the entire staff. Personally, you're giving me a lot of satisfaction, and I hope it's just the start. Secondly, I've seen you train, and lately you've been training like champions. Champions go beyond, so I say, let's go beyond our limits, and see what's on the other side. Remember you'll never be alone, we'll always be on the field with you. Good luck, guys. -Thanks. -Thanks. Guys, we've made it. If we didn't want to be here, we should have lost and not come, but here we are, and as long as we're here, let's try to win, it's all we can do. But the important thing, as he said, is to be calm. These are football matches, and football matches are played to have fun. Let's think about what we need to do. If we do that, we'll win. Ok? Always. Attack them from behind, both of them, when you've got the ball, aim. Same thing, Lorenzo, aim with the ball, Spinazzola push. We've already talked too much. Support pass for Berardi, onside, a cross kick looking for Spinazzola, controlling it with his chest, ball on the right, Spinazzola! Great block. Ciro Immobile! 2-0! Immobile! 2-0! Cakir. Too short, Berardi intercepts it, as usual Barella is running next to him. The support pass is for Immobile, Insigne's over there, onside, Lorenzo Insigne! Lorenzo il Magnifico! 3-0! Great goal! ITALY 3 - 0 TURKEY Italy is unstoppable! Am I pumping you up with this music? -Yeah, I like this. -You like this. This is from your time. -My time… -Many here weren't even born yet. And you were already going out. When you had lots of hair. Curly hair. A bit less… You were cute… Yeah, you were cute. COVERCIANO - FLORENCE THE DAY AFTER THE MATCH How's it going? Weak? Some bruises? You, Lorenzo? My abductor a bit. He needs to rest. Because you ran a lot yesterday, you took off even when you were on defence, and you ran about 50 metres. But you're alright? Yeah, yeah. And after the match you can't sleep. Yeah, with the extra time, you came back at 3:00 and it's hard to sleep. During the match? Were your legs ok? -Great, I felt fine. -Good, you feel good. I'll tell you how much you ran. You ran at least 11 kilometres. -I think Barella did… -He ran 13, 14 kilometres. Walk around on those stones, then a little cold water, then hot again, then cold again. Are you mad? Go on, nice and slow. Ok. You went full speed, huh? It never ends. A bit tired… Well, it's the day after the match. No, at half time, stop. DURING WALES - SWITZERLAND Offside… Go home! That was offside, too. DURING DENMARK - FINLAND Eriksen, the guy from Inter. They're giving him a cardiac massage. With a defibrillator. Now, live? Yeah, for the last five minutes, but they can't… They can't manage to resuscitate him. Oh, Lord… He fainted. Ah, for no reason? He wasn't hit by the ball? -No, nothing like that. -I'm nervous… Me too… It was terrible. It was really shocking. We saw it live because we were in the locker rooms, doing therapy, watching the match and… it was incredible, I couldn't watch. The others were watching, but… I was in such shock I couldn't watch, I felt empty… But the important thing is that the worst is over and Christian's doing better. And to see him on the field again as soon as possible. PARKEN STADIUM COPENAGHEN TUESDAY 15 JUNE Marco's rehabilitation programme has continued since our first meeting… the way we were planning, without any problems, without any setbacks. Paolo, do Insigne for me. Thank you… No, if Verratti's not coming, I'm not coming. No, if Verratti's not coming, I'm not coming. He's coming, just a minute. -Where are you going? -Huh? -Where are you going? -To the conference. -To the conference? -Yeah. Many players have been through a lot and have worked their way up, you know? I think that's important because you get here with the experience of… of having come from the bottom, so you give it even more value. The further down you come from and the higher you get, the nicer the satisfaction, the joy, are so… Yeah, I think it's really nice. Ball! Ciro, what are you doing? -It's amazing I can even walk today. -Alright, alright. The important thing is you know this is yours. Well done, Raffa! ONE DAY BEFORE ITALY - SWITZERLAND -Shoot! Go on! Shoot! -You were flying. Yeah, Sasà, it's special, Sasà. Come on, Sa'! Good, good, good! Pessina. Jorge. And Emerson. Castrovilli… Shall I be the fourth? I don't think it's anything… It's nothing special. A bit of healthy… hazing I do to myself, because I think the last guy to arrive is the last guy to arrive, and the last guy to arrive has to carry the balls, the cones, the jerseys, and help out. And the staff here don't make me feel bad that I'm the newest arrival, nor do they treat me differently because I'm an important footballer. That can't be. Can't you see it's sticking out here? No, you have to turn it the other way. I'll go get one that's already put together so we can try to understand… Let's see if we can figure it out. -Did that work? -Yeah. I'm trying to give you a hand because you don't understand a thing. No, this is a fun game. WEDNESDAY 16 JUNE VILLA BORGHESE - ROME Good morning, coach. THE DAY OF THE MATCH -Is the match today? -Yes. -Good luck. -Thanks. The important thing is to be really fast when we've got the ball, and to take risks. You can play up until here, two kicks, three kicks if possible. Here use your imagination, and you've got plenty, do whatever you want. One-two, one-two is fundamental, so pay attention. Let's not protest and think about what we have to do. Ok, guys? Good luck. Italy wins, just like against Turkey. Italy wins 3 to 0. The Azzurri's goal has not been entered for the tenth consecutive game. ITALY 3 - 0 SWITZERLAND COVERCIANO - FLORENCE THE DAY AFTER THE MATCH Just think, I wouldn't have even come last year. Why not? I wouldn't have been summoned if we'd done this last year. -Ah, you'd never come before? -No, I'd never come with you. Nice. Barella turns around well, while Di Lorenzo slips, it's Locatelli's ball, he tries with his left foot! It's a great evening for Locatelli! If a play like that happens 20 times, I never go attack an area like that. But the kick was too good. -Did you get excited? -Yeah! I was so possessed as I ran that I thought, "I'm going for a goal." Berardi's looking at it, he tries to go on the right like against Turkey, he keeps going, Locatelli in the middle! It's a great goal! With Switzerland, I told Gigi, "You won't let any goals in today, but trust me, it's the classic game where at the 70th minute you need to block a tough goal. That's how it is, so stay concentrated, don't give up, ask the others for help. Stay in the game, because today's match is shitty. We're playing well, we're moving, and when you play well like this, you'll get the chance to…" He got the chance in the 65th minute when he made a great save, and after the match I said, "You see?" Foul! DENMARK - BELGIUM That was really good. If the assist from the left… -He's good! -Denmark 1, Belgium 0. -They're outclassed, though. -Only Denmark's playing. But they're only winning 1-0. Did he have a lot of opportunities? Jesus… So if Denmark wins, they get all three points for this group? Yes. Anything can happen. Ciro, Ciro, Ciro, Ciro. -You have to call Gigio. -I told him. Let's recover well, guys. Do all your therapy. Cryotherapy, massages, everything… We need to recover perfectly. Ok? We have to play another great match against Wales, ok? The right mentality. It's definitely going to be… even more physical than against Switzerland. But we can play and get lots of goal opportunities. Ok? Good, enjoy your training. What's that tattoo of? You weren't even born when I got this. This is the Sampdoria crest. What year were you born? '91. I just said that, but you really weren't born. I got it in '83. Your mum and dad were still thinking about it. SATURDAY 19 JUNE ONE DAY BEFORE ITALY - WALES What did you do? You did this and you went here, when you should do this and go there. He puts it in front of you and you're in front of the goal. -And you've got it on the right. -Let me watch it again, I could've shot. -No, no, we'll watch it again. -Some things… On the field, since he was a striker, he tries to… give you as much advice as possible to help you, you know? That… helps you, it's nice, because you learn new things. Even things that might not be part of your technical characteristics, but that are important. You go close, start close. As soon as I jump to hit the ball, you have to take off, hoping that the ball arrives. The other evening the ball came three times, Ciro hit it, but you were both far away. 2-0. Immobile heads the ball, can't find a teammate, Switzerland in control. SUNDAY 20 JUNE THE DAY OF THE MATCH -Spellecchia. -They call him Spellecchia. A leg like yours, you can't even feel the work. I've never seen him run this fast. Too fast even, slow down a bit. It's getting better. It's getting better and… Of course I'm disappointed to be out, but I'm happy that… that the team's doing well. I'm getting excited watching the matches like all Italians, and… I'm also happy for myself, because at first I thought… I couldn't compete in the Euros, but little by little… it's getting better and better and I'm almost ready to go back. Emerson, Jorginho, Marco, Pessina, Federico, Bernardeschi and "Rooster." When we make a cross, let's not make high crosses, either straight for the goalpost, or between goalkeeper and defence. There goes Verratti, the ball's low, he's changing course, Italy's ahead! Pessina! Pessina takes it to 1-0! ITALY 1 - 0 WALES No, it was something we wanted to do for our fans who weren't able to watch the match at the stadium. So we wanted to sing this song all together to show how much we care about this jersey and this competition. No, no, I always like to joke around with the group, we always play music… I often play Neapolitan music, to be honest, I often listen to Neapolitan music. Hey, Locatelli! "Sun at night…" The first times we heard the Neapolitan song, Locatelli and I thought, "Where have we ended up? Who's playing these songs?" But now we always want to listen to that song in the bus every time. It was a bit… It's kind of our ritual. We always play it the day before the match, in the gym, everywhere. We're a group of super fans slash DJs. Our playlists are filling up with Neapolitan songs. And I had to learn the refrain to sing along with the group… I honestly don't even know who the singer is, but the song's called "What diet?" It might be impossible not to learn that song. It's playing all the time, so we've learned it. The one about cutlets and meatballs. It's a part of us now. It started out as a joke, but now we have fun listening to it. When the refrain comes on, the bus' windows almost break. The poor driver. It's nice, it's fun. You need that to form a group. -Go! -Go, go! If there's a gentle giant, it's fine. No, we'll definitely get Austria. We've played all the red ones. All of them? All the red ones. Switzerland, Wales and Belgium. Belgium's red too, if they make it… And semi-finals Poland. -When you see red… -We're like bulls. FRIDAY 25 JUNE ONE DAY BEFORE ITALY - AUSTRIA -The motto is, "We go," then? -We kill them. -And we go back. -And we go back… That's the motto. Three games, nine points, seven goals made, zero taken. THE HIVE STADIUM - LONDON The Azzurri have done brilliantly in the group stage, but from now on, "no hay mañana," there is no tomorrow, just matches, either in or out. Did you give us the Swiss balls? Ah, because… Go on… Keep going! -Yes, "Rooster"… -Hey, "Rooster", calm down! SATURDAY 26 JUNE Ok, guys, here we go. THE DAY BEFORE THE MATCH One important thing: Remember that they do their best after they lose the ball and get it back, and they get it back high. So let's be careful. Same thing with place kicks: they put the ball down, they get it back, and then it becomes dangerous. And if they keep their defence here, with a play like the one in Amsterdam or in Sofia, we can make a goal, ok? Locatelli vertical, Spinazzola, here comes Pessina, wide for Chiesa who's onside, he controls it with his head, -Chiesa again with his left foot! -Yes! Chiesa! Italy's ahead! Chiesa's scored! -1-0! -Yes! Extra time, Italy's ahead. Chiesa. ITALY 2 - 1 AUSTRIA Let's see. Good. A lot of suffering, but these are the best parts. I've lost my voice, everything. I won't sleep for 24 hours. Let's go! Get on, here comes the good part. Good evening. Thank you. He's going towards the defender, see? Stop here. Who can catch him? I always re-watch every match I play. I watch it immediately afterwards. SUNDAY 27 JUNE See what we can improve. Me personally, and also as a team. Yesterday's match was intense, very intense. Very physical. We may have done some things wrong. In the way we pushed them. We left some space between the lines. Sometimes the field was too open. But… In the end I think we deserved victory. With Austria, we played a great first half. And for the first time in these Euros we found ourselves in a situation where we couldn't get into the game. And that was something that made us all a bit nervous, because psychologically you start having this fear, like, "What if it doesn't happen this time?" Lainer looks for Alaba, the head shot by Arnautovic. Austria's ahead. Ball against the far goalpost, Alaba was still on the other side, Donnarumma can't calculate how far it will go out, and with a light hit, Arnautovic managed to put it on the other side. Keep an eye on Arnautovic's position, which is being checked by the VAR. -Offside, offside, offside! -Offside. Offside, Italy's saved. Offside. The tension increases, extra time. The two goals which were liberating, and their goal which was like saying, "We're not done suffering yet." So it was really the first match in a long time where we really suffered for 90 minutes plus extra time. I took the ball because I thought he'd put it in the centre, I moved to get there first, then I saw an Italy player and I knew it was Pessina, I tried to pass it to him with the tip of my foot. Luckily Pessina is always ready, always in the area. It was… It was great. If I think back on myself on the field right then, I don't… I don't have a clear memory. There are those five seconds when you don't understand, then you realise it, and from that moment on you start understanding what you've done. So I remember things from then on. But on the field, when the ball goes in… Absolutely nothing. I was in a trance. I was in a complete trance. The match with Austria was the hardest after the group stage, because it was the first match of the knockout stage, so we had to get used to it. The first one is always the hardest, and we knew that Austria was one of the… best teams of the Euros, physically. I think I'll carry that with me for my entire career, for my entire life, because it was the first goal that… made this record of the first father-son couple to score in the Euros. No, my hug with Roberto was natural, we were at Wembley, it was a tough match, and it had been a while since we hugged that fiercely, with that determination, with that intensity. So it… It was a really nice hug. It was a hug that included all of us. -"Rooster"… -Yes? -What do you think, Belgium or Portugal? -Portugal. Wrong! Belgium or Portugal? It's the same. They have ten defenders. -They all defend from behind, right? -Yeah, but so does Belgium. -So does Belgium? -Not all from behind, but… But you can see Belgium gets off balance when they throw a ball to Lukaku, you can start over. Belgium's more predictable. Whereas Portugal… they keep the ball close, they're all technical players… Look who I've brought you. Is the camera on? Hi! We get on well, so that makes being away from our families a bit easier. We have fun with the PlayStation or one of Insigne's pranks… Hey! Olé! Hey! I swear, I'm always careful as I walk now. I can't walk along looking at my phone or making a phone call, because at some point… Plus he's little, he can hide anywhere! ARE YOU SURE??? I knew it! And I get scared easily. I told him, "One of these days you're going to give me a heart attack." He scares me so much. -Hi, honey. -Hi, honey, how are you? It's always been my dream to have a family… while I'm still young. I found the right person, my wife, and we decided to have a family. I like responsibility, I like children, so it came pretty naturally. -Where are you? -There's… Look at them! We're really happy together, so you think about it a lot less, you accept being far away from friends and family in general. Hey, hey, hey! A video call, say hi, see if they're making mum angry, and that's it. I'll call you later. I've almost finished. Bye, honey. THURSDAY 1 JULY ONE DAY BEFORE ITALY - BELGIUM The only certainty is Captain Chiellini's return to defence along with Bonucci. Their proven experience to try to stop Lukaku. FC BAYERN CAMPUS - MUNICH FRIDAY 2 JULY Absolute calm, and play the way we've always played. THE DAY OF THE MATCH Let's forget everything we've said over the past few days. We know we're facing a good team, which is only right for a quarter-finals. Ok? Always defend, until… Together. If we're here, we defend here. De Bruyne will start dribbling because he's fast, powerful, technical. So keep tight and pressure him when he's got the ball, because he can put it anywhere. He can put the ball at 60 metres… He can put the ball past defence… Wherever he is, he can put the ball wherever he wants. But we have to do all this as a team. When we get there, stay calm. They'll give us some chances to shoot from here. So, calmly, prepare and we can shoot. But there's room for Insigne. Belgium's defence is a bit open, the two midfielders Witsel and Tielemans are having trouble. Insigne goes past Tielemans, ball at 18 metres, yes! Lorenzo il Magnifico! Lorenzo il Magnifico makes an amazing goal to bring Italy to 2-0! Guys, I'm sure we're going to play a great match. Good luck. Vertonghen, Verratti's advancing, Immobile's still down there, -from within the penalty area, Barella! -Amazing! Barella! The petrol that fuels the Azzurri's engine, Barella! 1-0! A great goal! I asked Marco for the ball, then I found myself in a… in a forest of legs, and I tried to move the ball. It was basically an instinctive goal. All I could do was move it and shoot before the goalkeeper could come out, so it was really great, I've never shot so hard in my life. It's over! ITALY 2 - 1 BELGIUM For the fifth time in its history, Italy is in the semi-finals of a European championship. They're going to Wembley to play against Spain. Thank you! We're so happy. Too many strong emotions… But Spinazzola's injury was a real blow. Spinazzola on the opposite side, accelerating, trying to overcome him by himself. Hold on, Spinazzola's got a physical problem. He's hurt, he's hurt. And we feel really bad about it… because he didn't deserve it. We can do it. Will you slow down? Did you see or not? Spina, Spina, Spina, Spina, Spina! Spina! Spina! Spina! Spina! Spina! Spina! COVERCIANO - FLORENCE THE DAY AFTER THE MATCH I've got the MRI in Rome today, then we'll see. Don't kiss my forehead, I'm all sweaty. You played a great Euro Cup… Well done… Thank you. Spinazzola is… I think he was the best wingback of the Euros. So he was a fundamental player for us. Because of his strength, his drive, how he recovers, and… And he didn't deserve to suffer this terrible injury in such an important match. So it was… difficult for all of us. So now we have another reason to win this European Championship, for him, who gave us so much, and who can no longer do anything for the team at the moment. Hi, guys! Let's go! Oh well… Thanks, guys. With this fantastic group. Thank you! I'm going… Let's raise this Cup with crutches. Perfect… When did you think you'd make a goal? When you kicked the ball? No, when I jumped… I had the ball, no one was coming out. We knew they wouldn't be coming out. In fact, yesterday, when I shot… Yeah, but the centre should have come out… Because Vertonghen was on Ciro, if I have the ball, one has to come out, they can't stay… A dangerous attack by Belgium, three on three, a fake by De Bruyne! -A great save by Donnarumma! -You can say that again! The important thing is the capsule here… It's a bit twisted, so it hurts. You know what we can do here? The "penguin." -Yeah… -The "penguin" standing up. I'll do it later. This Euro Cup, we're getting the feeling like we might win it. When we left, if they'd told us we'd get to the semi-finals, playing well, we would probably have been happy. Now we've kind of smelled… blood, and we want to bite, we want to win. Being a part of this adventure allows me to experience other evenings like Italy - Austria, like Italy - Belgium, and that's what we live for in the end, it's not just about victories, or your career or succeeding. We live for nice moments, to be happy about what we do and… And I feel happy here. Well done! All penalty kicks today, and I want to see the finals, when we get to the shoot-out. "Hey, I have to put the car in the garage!" Coach! Here comes Daniele, coach! In Berlin one guy took off his shoes. I said, "What if we keep going?" "No, I'm still not shooting." He took off his shoes, his shin guards, everything… There we go! Come on Ale, you never let me win. I've already seen this… in Germany. And I saw a guy pull a muscle… Normally you don't stop, you jump. -That's how I shot in the match… -Good, good, well done. If there's a shoot-out, they've already decided you'll shoot. Even though this year, my penalty kicks haven't been as good. Although for the shoot-out, it's not "the guy who shoots best," it's whoever's cooler shoots. Mbappé is an amazing player, but he missed. It's not that if you're good… -It's how you feel right then. -Yeah… MONDAY 5 JULY Ladies and gentlemen, Alitalia, SkyTeam partner, is happy to welcome you to London Luton. ONE DAY BEFORE ITALY - SPAIN THE HIVE STADIUM - LONDON Can it be like this in July? It's cold… imagine the winter! It's 5 July… Summer comes early here. It's almost over. A few nice days here? That would take a miracle… Does it get to 30 degrees in that region? It was a tough match. Spain gave us… They gave us a lot of sleepless nights and a lot of disappointment. Yes! Come on, guys. Well, we know who's good in shoot-outs, but you have to feel it then, too. After 120 minutes of effort… you have to have the strength to go make that shot, and… And it's not so simple, it's really tough. -Let's send them home! -Robby! Come on, Robby! Go, coach! Go, Ciro! TUESDAY 6 JULY THE DAY OF THE MATCH TWO HOURS BEFORE THE SEMI-FINALS Alright, guys, we can do this, too. This is going to be a good match too, the kind you have to fight for and work for, and get angry, in order to get here. So we have to be happy to be in this match, which will be a good match, tough, and I'm sure that in the end, you'll do what you have to do, because you're the best. When we push them, we all go together and we give it our all. When we need to defend, we defend. If we need to defend here, we defend here. You're on the field, you understand things better than me right then, because you're there, so… You know what you need to do, I can't tell you from there. If you're there and you decide to do something, it means it's right. You can't always be in control during matches, we'd like that, but there are also our opponents, so sometimes it can be difficult. When that happens, stay compact. If we have to wait, we wait. When they start playing, keep calm… let them play. If they're playing here, it's not a problem for us. Ok? They're a great team. In the World Cup, it's us, them, and maybe a few others. They're good players, young but good. So it's not going to be an easy match, we're going to suffer up until the end, but let's try to do it together just like we always have, and remember that you're the best, ok? Good luck. WEMBLEY STADIUM - LONDON So for the sixth time in the history of the Euro Championship, Italy and Spain go to a penalty shoot-out for the finals. Bonucci. He surprises Unai Simón! Bonucci scores! Morata. Sometimes I talk to Gigi about some things. I don't dare tell him, "Save it like this." I give him advice about things he might not think about, because he's 22. -Saved! Saved! Saved! -Donnarumma saves it! Want to film the penalty kick, how I stop Jorginho, or do I trust him? This is tough. -Net! -It's over! We've won! -Now we can celebrate! -With class! He scored with class! On Sunday we're coming back to Wembley for Italy's fourth finals in a European championship. Jorginho is flawless! Right then… I knew what was at stake. The stadium was really full… but I tried to breathe. I tried not to think about everything around me. I just tried to concentrate on the goalkeeper, and the things I always train to do. And luckily it went well. After the ball went in, I got a wave of emotions, you know? After all that "pressure", let's say. I let it all out after the ball went in. Seeing all my teammates running over, and how the stadium was celebrating… ITALY 5 - 3 SPAIN Congratulations. Oh my goodness! There was a strategy. Tell him the strategy. We had a strategy, whoever missed the first one… I told him, "Locatelli, don't worry, we'll miss the first one." -So we'll make them think… -It's all downhill from there. And it's all downhill from there. That's what happened before, and what will always happen, it happened today and then… See you here on Sunday. COVERCIANO - FLORENCE THE DAY AFTER THE MATCH -I dreamt about Busquets last night. -Yeah? -He was in my bed with me. -Was he nutmegging you? In the second half, from the 60th minute to the 90th, I couldn't keep going. -I couldn't… -As a strategy… I just couldn't keep going, plus we didn't pause for a moment. They make you run behind the ball, after all. Only your left leg. I was blocking for 60 minutes. -Without ever touching the ball. -60 minutes of beep… 60 minutes running after the ball. Italy-Spain was the highest intensity match compared to all the others, followed by Italy-Switzerland. -We leave on Saturday. -I thought Monday. -So what's today? -Today is Wednesday. Today is Wednesday, tomorrow is Thursday. We stay today, tomorrow and the day after. -You've dealt with us a long time. -We're happy to. What, don't you want to taste? For science… Go on, Ciro. I swear, I don't want to give it to you because you play for Juventus. Sorry, bro. -Go Naples! -Exactly! Who's that? Chiesa? He's good. He has to come to Naples. You have to come to Naples. You get the last one. Come on. I'll tell you one thing, guys… It's the first goal they take. He couldn't see the ball, zero vision. "Buffalo." "Buffalo," you could stop that with your head. You're letting yourself be influenced a bit. FRIDAY 9 JULY Run a bit, otherwise… Well, today is 9 July, it's Luca birthday, and… well, it's a special day for him and also for us to celebrate it with him. I also think it's a great time to celebrate, a great situation and… And I really hope he can remember it as one of the best birthdays of his life. The coach said we can win, so… let's go get this… Cup! SATURDAY 10 JULY ONE DAY BEFORE THE FINALS It's been 40 days… that every time I walk into this room I ask myself… what's happening, because it really feels like… like living a dream. Good morning! Right now, we're not just a team but we're a team that's representing more than 60 million people. And, trust me, in the club it's one thing, but when you do it on national team, it's priceless. And to give such a dream to Italy, to see it come true… makes you become a legend of the national team. I think when every child starts kicking around a football, he hopes to become a legend of the Italian national team. We're one step away from becoming that. I've experienced and I've been a part of really good national teams. Qualitatively as good as this one, perhaps even better. Today I saw the young kid… and I saw the "Rooster" Belotti who went in the middle, sliding, laughing, joking, jumping on Ciro, who's his best friend. The group always has this way of… It's really like a family. People always say that, but… this group has really shown that they're like that. This team is the most team-like that I've ever been on. The national team whose members are the most united. This group has a great gift. They always experience things calmly. This is nature. Nature recreates itself. -This was a thingy before. It was a… -It was born with a jersey. A silkworm. Go on, fly away! Bring us the Cup, butterfly! LEAVING FOR LONDON -Taking this… -Good morning. We have often used the word "beauty" in its most… in its most general sense. So beauty not only in a technical, in a competitive sense, in the sense of value when it comes to sporting competitions, but also in the sense of being together, sacrificing yourself, helping each other, sharing, glorifying, suffering, rejoicing. All these feelings come together in an extraordinary concept, the concept of beauty. Tomorrow we'll do 40, 45 of training… THE LODGE - LONDON …having fun and believing in it. -How much longer? -About 26 hours. But how many centimetres, "Lion"? Joy! When you get to the finals, winning is less of a joy and more of a relief, because it's hard to live with defeat. And in the locker room, the winners should always remember that in the locker room next door there's probably somebody crying. I'm taking it well, I'm happy, I'm happy about what we're managing to do but we're still… We're not there yet… And, like I said, we've worked hard from when I started three years ago until today. So we have to finish off well. And I kind of follow the coach's feeling. Before the tie, the coach told me there wouldn't be any problems. But with Spain I was a bit less sure, and I have to say, he's always right. SUNDAY 11 JULY THE FINAL MEETING Are you ready? Ok, guys, before writing… It seems that this is their formation. It makes no difference to us, we're going to play our match. The formation is: Gigio… Di Lorenzo, Leonardo, Giorgio. Spinazzola… Emerson. Jorginho, Marco, Barella, Ciro, Lorenzo and Federico. So, I've got nothing to say, you know what you are, and we're not here by chance. We're the masters of our own destiny, not the referee, not our opponents, nobody… Ok? You know what you need to do, you're a good team. Good luck! WEMBLEY STADIUM - LONDON We'll pay here! THE FINALS We've put on quite the show, kicked away clichés, got approval everywhere, "one more centimetre," copyright Roberto Mancini, and it would be a crime to stop here. Good evening from London. He gives the ball to Kane, the captain can go, Trippier's coming up from the right, the ball is his, here comes Walker. There are two of them, Walker joins. Here comes the cross, here comes Shaw, and England is ahead. Luke Shaw. After just two minutes of play, he surprises the Italian defence. He tries with his head, the ball's in front of the net, goal! -A goal to tie it up! -Goal! It's tied! Bonucci ties it up! 1-1! 1-1, it's legit! A tie was in the air, Italy had been gaining ground for a few minutes. Saka. The ref's whistling for Kuipers. A penalty shoot-out will determine the Euro 2020 finals. The "Rooster" Belotti. Saved, saved by Pickford. No! Pickford saves Jorginho's shot! We have to start over. We're in your hands, Gigio Donnarumma. We have to fix these numbers. Saka. ITALY 4 - 3 ENGLAND -Yes! -Victory! Oh my God! Great job! Champions! SPECIAL THANKS TO STEFANO ACCORSI AND PAOLO CORBI What a film we've made, guys… What a… film! TWO DAYS EARLIER "Honor goes to the man in the arena, the man whose face is covered in dust, sweat and blood, the man who fights with courage, who continuously makes mistakes… Knowing that there is no undertaking that can be called such which is free of errors and shortcomings. The man who dedicates his entire self to achieving a goal, who knows how to get excited and give it his all, and who dedicates himself to a good cause. The man who, when things go well, finally experiences the triumph of great achievements, and who, when things go badly, falls, knowing that he tried. This man will never have a place next to those mediocre souls who know neither victory nor defeat." Yeah, Luca! Yeah, Luca!
