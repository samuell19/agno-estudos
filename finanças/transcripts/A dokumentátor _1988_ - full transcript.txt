Produced at the Hunnia Film Studio with the assistance of the Ministry of Culture, MOKEP and the Innovation Studio It is not dawning where it used to, my fate is being sealed. It is not dawning where it used to, lawmen came and apprehended me. The Documentalist?video novel I'm finished for today. You'll find me upstairs if you want to leave. Cinematographers Leave! Leave me?Have you lost your mind? Leave me be, go away! This film takes place in Hungary, 1987 Why are you putting on airs? You're a servant just like me, only one floor above. Wait a second, I'll see you out. A film by Istvan Darday and Gyorgyi Szalai Hi. - Is everything alright? - Just fine. Don't worry. Who gives a shit? Fine. Pronto. Got laid, I guess. I'll be here tomorrow morning. VIOLENCE?PHYSICAL, PSYCHIC, MENTAL ?CHOOSE VIOLENCE?ECONOMIC, JUDICIAL, MORAL, RELIGIOUS, POLITICAL, MILITARY-POLICE CHOOSE The Lord condemns violence, and he condemns indifference even more. Because violence is imperfect philanthropy, indifference is perfect selfishness. HELL Very good. - Good afternoon, Madam. - Good afternoon. Come out, you have a visitor. I am aware that you know we couldn't work it out even if we had ten machines. Your offer (buying that specific camera) is honourable. According to my plan, we'd establish some sort of cooperation to have my camera assembled in Hungary with Japanese components. You know, Frankie, that I can't be accused of overenthusiasm, but I think that now... yes, sure... This case has reached a nice stage. You know, I told you about this... this Japanese opportunity. Yeah. Yes, this friend. So, yes... this relationship, this is superb stuff, Got me? This is... This... well, an official thing would be much worse. Think about it! It's private: he works there for the Japanese firm and his wife is Hungarian. Can it get any better than this? Settled, no doubt. There was a Danish case just like this. I based this on that one, remember? A small Danish firm did it, so why couldn't we, since a Hungarian... with a Hungarian wife, an expatriate in Japan. Obvious. That's it. Well okay, but hold your horses. I wouldn't compromise if I didn't have the... you know, in the Ministry there's the... your former mate from university. He unofficially undertook it, so the export-import aspects and concerns of this whole thing will be all right. Tschuss! - Good afternoon. - Hello. Just a sec. Thank you, please open your trunk, we'll take it out in a moment. Goodbye. I think he's in the winter garden. [Gabor Body's voice:] We'd discuss video in general. In any case, we have to separate two domains. One is that in what respect does the medium offer new possibilities for the creator, the other is that in what respect does this medium create new possibilities for the viewer regarding communication and distribution. It will cause, and is causing changes effectively shocking all known possibilities in both areas. Let's say, that for me, a "cinematographist" ?which literally means picture writer? the difference is that I work with videotape, not film which means lots of artistic potential and restrictions as well, because with film it's easier to? So may I borrow this material? Sometime soon. This is my newest purchase. - What's up? - It will be an exciting thing. Economists convene and that must be recorded. I need a camera. Go there with a tape recorder, record what they say, 'cause the interesting thing is their speech. And if you're curious about their face take photographs. No. Who said something, and how, what was the situation, how mettlesome he was ?it's not just the same. What... what was the poise, the underlying notion. These things are not of secondary importance at all. Frankie boy, listen? This is where the artistic quality comes into play. Thirty hours of a meeting of economists. How much are those thirty hours worth, when we don't have footage about things which take place in our time? - Appeal to the Balazs Bela Studio or the KISZ KB, are you kidding me? This is? That's not exactly the point. It could be made not only about economists. This could be made, well uh... by recording the workers, their opinions about this, and other strata, circles. The problem is not with the employees because they all want to work for the money to provide income for their families. The problem is with the management. Got sixteen suits in the changing-room. They should be filmed on the streets. They have to capture how they look like. Sixteen men get suits in the small shed. I'm at my workplace between 7 a.m. and 4 p.m., then, in a refreshed state I just leave and try to earn real money for my family by moonlighting. Second job. Why am I not being paid during work time? What about family recreation? Family pastime? Holidays, being together... we don't get any of that, all we do is work but there are some folks who can go to certain places we can't even recognize from photos. Perhaps on weekends we might go to the movies, but when you're tired you don't want to have fun, you'd rather sleep or rest. You drink your two pints, go to bed, then fall asleep, that's it. Suffice it to say I earn 240 forints by working for 8 hours. I buy one kilogram of meat but I can't tell my child that I'm not too well off, so take only two snacks, son, because the truth is, I can't afford more. Night is falling, I should go home. I'm afraid the lads are going to beat me up, but don't hurt me buddies, I'm not responsible, I'm in love with a brunette, I'll never leave her. Good evening, good evening, brunette! I'm asking for a night's lodging If you let me in. I can't put up any rover, my mother's not at home, I'm alone. - Hi, Chip! - Hi. Your daughter has arrived. - Going strong? - Thanks, it's a success. Business has been booming since I've been in charge behind the counter. I work hard. We have many customers. That's good for me of course, because the higher the profit the higher my salary. The most useful employment of capital for my father is that which yields him the largest profit, but this employment is not always the most useful for society. The most useful is that which stimulates the productive power of its land and labour. So in order to live, you non-owners are forced to place yourselves directly or indirectly at the service of the owners, i. e. become dependent upon them. That's why you're sitting behind the counter, aren't you? That's not true. I'm not only behind the counter. Oh, your father called. You can go upstairs. Oh, thanks. Listen here. That which exists for me through the medium of money, that which I can pay for, i. e. which money can buy, that am I, the possessor of money. The stronger the power of my money, the stronger am I. The properties of money are mine, the possessor's, properties and essential power. Therefore what I am and what I can do is by no means determined by my individuality. I'm ugly, but I can buy the most beautiful woman. Which means to say that I am not ugly, for the effect of ugliness, its repelling power, is destroyed by money. As an individual, I am lame, but money procures me twenty-four legs. Consequently, I am not lame. I am a wicked, dishonest, unscrupulous and stupid individual, but money is respected, and so also is its owner. Money is the highest good, and consequently its owner is also good. Moreover, money spares me the trouble of being dishonest, and I am therefore presumed to be honest. I am mindless, but if money is the true mind of all things, how can its owner be mindless? What is more, he can buy clever people for himself, and is not he who has power over clever people cleverer than them? Through money I can have anything the human heart desires. Do I not therefore possess all human abilities? Does not money therefore transform all my incapacities into their opposite? Now I feel like an old person. You visit me only for the money. Why would you deprive me of these 24 jolly legs? I don't want to deprive you at all. I'd rather you stood on your own tiny feet. Hmm? - Not much of a problem, is it? - No. Why are you here? You weren't at home, and I needed the monolingual dictionary. Didn't I ask you not to come here? But you weren't at home. I had to. The house is yours from the cellar to the attic. We agreed that you must not enter this place. Didn't we? You know what? Lock yourself in your own little citadel, Raphael! If... I can document myself with video... Visually. Let's forget the... forget the... narcissistic motives. It's obvious that this has a technical aspect. Right? There's another aspect which hasn't been revealed by any previous self-documenting technique. Not even by diary nor by the tape recorder. That was only the sound. You see, such techniques alienate, don't they? But this allows me the possibility of seeing myself. To let me confront myself. I can play back myself, so objectification is is identical with myself, my own mug and that is worth trying. The question is, is lying possible? - Hi. Is it broken? - Yeah. Let's see if I can start it up. Something is wrong. Let's have a look at the back. Wait. No wonder it won't start. The ignition cable is disconnected. It was me. This is downtown Greensboro in North Carolina the place where the Negroes' lunch counter sit-in movement was born three years ago. Lunch counters are desegregated now so are parks and recreational facilities. There is token integration of schools but now these demonstrators say they want more. Leader of their struggle to have all racial barriers eliminated is James Farmer, national director of the Congress of Racial Equality. One ticket please. I'm sorry but I do not choose to sell you a ticket. You do not choose to sell me a ticket? Is this because of my race? - No comment. - No comment? Thank you very much, Sir. In general the negro demonstrators and the white townspeople treated one another courteously but there were specific jibes at the presence of Mr. Farmer. Hi-ho, the derry-o The farmer in the dell. The farmer takes a wife. - A black wife! - All niggers. ...The Lord is on our side, someday. Oh, deep in my heart, I do believe... - Am I admitted? - No Sir, well, you cannot be admitted. - Why? - I'm not going to serve you. - Because of my race? - I'm not going to serve you. - Because of my race? - Move on! - I'm not going to serve you. - Why? Why am I not qualified? I'm human. I'm not going to serve you. - I don't dislike you, boy. - I don't dislike you. - Then why don't you serve me? - I'm not going to serve demonstrators. Today, tomorrow, or any day. If I came back by myself would you serve me? No, you're a demonstrator. - I won't be demonstrating. - You are a demonstrator. We shall overcome some day. I have a dream that one day, down in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of "interposition" and "nullification"? one day right there in Alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers. I have a dream today. ASSASSINATION OF MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. ? 1968?USA FRANCE CHINA CZECHOSLOVAKIA In 1968 we were crazy about the proletariat. In bistros, in smoke-filled rooms in pamphlets we prepared them to accomplish their historical mission. But of course, the workers slaving away in their jobs didn't give a damn. The working-class was so strongly present in our fantasies we inevitably had to open the student movement up to them and its left-wing political activities. We said hello to them from the Latin Quarter. A group called "Long live the revolution". And he starts his odyssey on the assembly line influenced by the so-called ???. For on June 5th hundreds of students blocked the adjoining highway. The confrontations with the police lasted all day long. BEIJING We sold watches which has also increased our popularity. Everyone has come to lend us their support. And we've also all? Procession at the 17th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. The march proceeds with the towering statue of the Great Helmsman. Here are the units of the Red Guard with guns on their shoulders and Red Books in their hands. Are you sure you couldn't call me, or you didn't want to? The telephone junkie phase is over. - I didn't want to. - Yes. I didn't want to call you, and I won't do it again. But I'll be back. You need this just as much as we do. Good afternoon. Thanks. Notable events in recent months are being discussed nationwide in party conventions in Czechoslovakia. The party's new action program and the personal changes affecting the party's leadership have been discussed. Results achieved through the deepening of socialist democracy are discussed cordially by the delegates not only on the pulpit but also in the breaks of vital party meetings with Alexander Dubcek, first secretary of the party. CZECHOSLOVAKIAN DELEGATION IN HUNGARY Budapest put out bunting. The government and party delegation of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic stayed in Hungary for a short visit. Many waited for and greeted the Czechoslovakian leaders on the streets of Pest. Wherever they went, they were met with respect and affection. The delegation arrives at the Parliament. The leaders of the Hungarian government and the Party welcome Alexander Dubcek, first secretary of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, and Prime Minister Oldrich Cernik in the salon of the presidential council. The Czechoslovakian and Hungarian government and party delegations discussed issues concerning both parties and countries. They agreed on concluding a new twenty-year Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance. The cross-party conference was held in the headquarters of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party. The delegations held a thorough conference on matters pertaining to the situation of the international labor movement. The Czechoslovakian delegation laid a wreath on the monument to the Hungarian heroes. The Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance was signed by Prime Ministers Oldrich Cernik and Jeno Fock. The official record is the document of the two adjacent countries' friendly relationship. The strengthening of the two countries' continuing friendship was also demonstrated by the Budapest Summit. The first secretary of the Hungarian party, Janos Kadar, said that constructing the socialist society gives meaning and purpose to our joint work. The first secretary of the Czechoslovakian party, Alexander Dubcek, emphasized that built on the best traditions, we shall unite our forces to further consolidate the unity of the communist movement. PRAGUE WAR, COUP D'ETAT, PROTEST REFORM, REVOLUTION, COUNTERREV., WAR OF INDEPENDENCE PRAGUE REPORT A film report has just been received from Prague. Life is slowly returning to its former state after the end of August. In the first days of September, traces of attempts at traffic-hindering were still visible here and there e. g. burned-out buses and various groupings. Typical scene: groups arguing on the streets and squares, who try to convince each other with more or less serious arguments. The sobriety, the people's tradition of friendship, the discipline of the troops and the Czechoslovakian party's and government agencies' actions overcome the difficulties. HOMECOMING SOLDIERS Farewell to the remaining allies, then back home. Troops of our popular army stayed in the Socialist Republic of Czechoslovakia for 67 days. They return to home bases under the new treaties. Red and national flags fly in the October wind at the rolling command post indicating that our soldiers were led to the land of our friends to fulfil their internationalist duties. The first units to return home were received with warm welcomes in front of the Gyor Town Council. Troops returning to their stations served well in defending the positions of socialism in Czechoslovakia. There's a vulture in the background. It feels like Sunday. Everyone's taking a nap. This tranquility is elusive, though. Something is afoot. I've got a cabin in Pomaz, because I dig my mother-in-law... Look at this, cowboy! I'm grabbing it. - Down, then... - It comes back by itself. We work so well together, you see? - Very sexy. - You're really enjoying it, huh? Slowly, slowly, slowly! I've got a cabin in Pomaz... Don't let the boss find out! Look at that, she's blushing! Her ears. Her ears are blushing! Made for the general public. Seriously, why is this here? I told you, it's a bait. To make them think that I smoke cigarettes like this. Then you must say, "there you go, this is it, choose one of these." - Yeah, that's it. - Makes sense. We've run out of hard packs, we have only longer ones. And soft packs. Okay. Budapest Ferihegy Airport Terminal 2 - Bye. Pick me up on Friday. - Good. Take care! Bye. I'd like this one, too. 6000 forints, Sir. You knew my husband. He was an incredibly decent man, y'know. But what should I do? I have nothing to say against him. You have absolutely no idea what were those Italians like, y'know? You enter a department store and they storm you. If you want to buy a shoe, they'll take your shoes off of your feet. They absolutely won't let you think or look around. Truly awful. This guy lived in South Tyrol, y'know, he was extremely rich, I had everything, I had all I wanted after all, I had an amazing car, things like that, so... There's stunning things out there, y'know? I went to the service once because my car broke down, and what did I see? They dump two-year old cars. They rot there in the parking area, y'know, eaten by rust. They'd been in mint condition. Truly awful... All this hustle and bustle, you see, we used to travel a lot, I always had to have dinner with him, and... y'know, that I don't... I'm basically like a stay-at-home. I couldn't stand that kind of thing. Additionally, we've been to Venice. I refused to go anywhere else with him? you know him, y'know, everyone goes to Venice. I thought I'd take a look around. It's a very famous city after all. I went to Venice, y'know, I could hardly move around. We wanted to eat an ice cream, but the place was so packed that we couldn't sit down, y'know. It was so dreadfully dull I thought I'd be smothered by the crowd. It was full of tourists, horrendous... And that other thing, y'know, Well, y'know how much I loved living here. I was so scared of this departure. I don't know how charming this man was, who could persuade me to leave, but I for one know how much I missed these... circumstances at home. I absolutely loved being at home. I miss the town hall where I used to work, I miss my colleagues, the good old eight-hour workdays, my monthly salary of 3200 forints. I was absolutely satisfied with it. The streets, let's say the Red Star Tractor Works on Red Army street. I absolutely loved being here, you see. But in Italy you enter a store, you don't even know where to go next, you have no idea, you don't understand the language... Utterly stunning. I didn't like being there. That guy was pestering me all the time, he went to a Hungarian tutor; I didn't even have to work, you know? I was at home all day, sitting in the apartment, watching videos, I was sick and tired of it, you know? Csilla? Pinch me! Dear Csilla... Unreal. - How did you end up here? - I arrived yesterday. People say things have changed. Really? To some extent. They say everything is fine. Well, I'll try and find out whether it's true. Tell me more about yourself! Now that I can see you I feel all right. Me too, I haven't seen you for such a long time... I'm speechless. It was such a long time ago. Listen here, shouldn't you be thinking about... starting this whole thing over again? That would be very difficult now. Listen, that's everything I've been hoping for, that I'd come home to be with you. New vistas opened up for me. I don't have to roam or wander about the world aimlessly, but... And I go home and we start anew. I didn't think I could see you again in Hungary. Do you believe me? That it was very difficult? Life is like that. I've got you! It was ages ago! Take a look at this. You're with me too. You're always by my side. Eotvos Lorand University Stalin. Comrade Stalin is omnipresent wherever the decisive battle of the socialist industrialization is fought. The frothy waters of the Dnieper generate electricity for Soviet power. Ordzhonikidze, Kaganovich, Kalinin. Voroshilov, Kuibyshev, Kirov. On the path of socialist economy. At the first meeting of the shock worker collective farmers, Stalin said: "In the kolkhoz system the farmers work for themselves and for the benefit of their kolkhozes." Each and every nation of the Soviet Union consider Stalin their leader. In 1937, the Soviet people elected representatives to the Supreme Council. Comrade Stalin talks about what the true representatives of the people should be like. The people, the voters, expect the delegates to fulfil their duties diligently, not to be philistine politicians, but to work as conscious political workers and to be resolute revolutionaries like Lenin. A huge, liberating mission is being accomplished by the people. We must be worthy of this honour. Men in White Yugoslav-Soviet Treaty of Friendship. Here's Comrade Stalin. We have no more doleful news to impart: Stalin is no more. The miners commemorated the great one with bowed heads and heavy hearts. His body may rest on the catafalque, but the Leninist-Stalinist party lives on! His companions, his faithful disciples bid him farewell. Comrade Rakosi, who was set free by him, brought all our sorrow to the catafalque. ...into a happy tomorrow. Because we fight for Stalin,? Our country was mourning too. and Stalin is peace, and the world will be a better world with Stalin! This is what happens to every AVO member Mindszenty has returned. Don't you have something to say? What do you mean? I mean I've had an inkling for quite some time that you, well, have someone in your life. You're not disclosing that, even though we had an arrangement whereby... when somebody else... comes into our lives, a new flame, one of us informs the other. - Are you pulling my leg? - No. I think you're just not honest with me. You don't treat me like you used to. You're someone else completely, you've changed. You look like a different man. What are you saying, Chip? What is it? Nothing. I recall the outset when... you were still loving me. I felt like being loved, anyway. I remember our first night together. I remember when you held me in your arms. You took me upstairs, into the bed. It was so wonderful. Supper, everything. No more. Don't be silly! What is it? Sorry, but... I'm a bit upset. What? What have I done? Nothing. You've forgotten me. A fat lot you care! Don't cry, don't be silly! Tell me, what is it? Please. I have to admit something horrible. Tell me. I cheated on you. - What? - I cheated you. Let's go. It's green. - Hi! Is Rambo here? - Hi. I'll go get him. Get here immediately, you've got a fiery guest. Don't you get offended! You hear me?! Answer then! What is wrong with me?! Listen, didn't I phone you one hour ago? That I'm coming? That I'm almost here, and you should wait for me? You're building an enormous house. Hi. Hello. How was your trip? It was fine. And how did you spend your time? I was working. Where? Have you found a new job? No. I spoke with Laura for a while after work. Her new boyfriend left her. Again. - I had to listen to her pep talk. - How unlucky! - Where was Rambo? - Rambo? He's here. - Oh, he's here? - He's just been eating pickled fish. - He hasn't been here recently. - He probably went to the market. No, thanks. I don't need it. Don't you get offended! - Do you hear me? - I hear you. Answer then! I don't get it, what is wrong with you? What is wrong with me?! What have I done? Did I hurt you? Listen, didn't I call you one hour ago? - You did. - That I'm coming? That I'm almost here, and you should wait for me? - Huh? - Yeah, I'm listening. What if an important client had come, - what would've happened? - Waiting. Okay. You can't do this. We had an arrangement in the beginning if I'm not mistaken, didn't we? We did. Don't you talk to me like a jerk! Do you hear me?! Come out of the kitchen! - I hear you. - Come out! How dare you? Listen here, don't start to peel vegetables while we're talking, okay? You're not even at home at all! I'm not your slave, pure and simple. What? You heard it right. What was it? I'm not your slave, pure and simple. How do you know? - How do you know? - I'm not your slave, there, I said it. Are you sure? It is not true that I don't mind being rich. I'm not saying it right. That is not what bothers me. I like being rich. What bothers me is that I like to deem myself superior, and I do deem myself superior. That's why I'm rich. I didn't inherit my wealth. That's why I am what I am. And the ideal status... would be... I don't know what would be ideal... So my ideal is that I could enjoy my possessions, my fortune, my power, my life but at the same time I'd be dead certain that I could abandon them whenever I wanted to, that I can live without them. And I'm not quite sure about this. Theoretically, yes. It's not only a question of wealth, but a question of difference. I'm a bit ashamed to confess that. But I'm not a hypocrite. A lot can be said about me, but I'm no hypocrite. I don't like people. I don't like these people. These bacon-eating, stew-smelling, pickle-gobbling ordinary men walking in coats with mothballs. I'm very sorry for them. But I don't like to travel on the subway. I hate grocery stores. I haven't been in any for years. I'm sick of these filthy, congested streets, standing in queues, and I wouldn't like to relapse. I wish these things didn't exist. This is why I'm willing to do whatever it takes, and if I don't deceive myself I supposedly do take measures to protect myself. I don't... I don't like to mingle, though. 1.7 billion years old cliffs in North America in the bed of the Colorado river. The continents had been drifting for millions of years before they reached their current places. Having just fast-forwarded the geological eras, we can see that the North and South American continents had been shifting before they met. The northern continent was covered by a shallow sea where the Grand Canyon spread across one of the huge, arid islands. The Atlantic Ocean did not exist at that time. Things that represent some kind of value get suppressed anyway. You can't collect them. What exists, means something, and is worthy won't be hyped, it remains a secret. They hide it. What you collect is not exactly full-value material. You know this too. Why should they have full value? What am I, the Almighty? Why would it... Why, what you advocate, is that of full value? Just because you want to make a film about reality, it becomes "full value"? Capturing reality is not the work of a solitary cinematographer. There's something more to it, Frankie boy. This whole "My Hungarian Camera case" deals with this. The matter at issue is, what I'm saying, our labour of love somehow, can't be done by either a solitary actor or a documentalist ?do you see what I mean? What I say is that we need something ?this would be the Hungarian Camera? which would be accessible for anyone. Got it? It ceases to exist when what's-her-name Juli Kudlik appears on screen and tells you what's the deal, what is reality, while me, the viewer is listening. What I do with video: don't you realize, that ?I mean, uh, pardon, with the video-lexicon, the whole research? the moment when someone has a video, it can't be only my privilege ?it is mine at present? but there will come a time when those will be copyable and recordable. So according to me, video, the Hungarian Camera would not revolutionize cinema, contrary to what some believe, but it could revolutionize the fountain pen. Get it? - I understand, but? - Everyone could write, pure and simple, everyone could shoot, i. e. everyone could speak. That is the point. Not that you, like er... a new Jesus Christ, set out for Golgotha with a camera, which you cajoled out of me. Why did you break off your development work? - While we're on the subject. - What do you think? Why? Because it couldn't be developed. The whole conception is still valid, though. I think what the video can and will offer, and in what respect it will change the importance of communications? Narrative communication is a thing of the past. Things have become much more dynamic. Movement, events... Something simultaneous... People are overwhelmed by information. But at the same time it might endow viewers with a false sense of reality, so... I think I'm there, although it's not really me and those eyes are not mine which choose what I want to see, what I notice in that thing, but it's the choice of the eye of someone else's: the camera's. It is rather obvious that a camera position, an optical illusion, the reporter's, the cinematographer's own point of view enters my home, ?PAKISTAN: The impending tempest? comes up on my screen in a terribly powerful way, and I'm inevitably beginning to see things through his eyes. This is not the fault of the technique, or the medium, so to speak. This medium can be used in lots of different ways ?CHILE: Black Septembers? and is used in multifarious ways indeed. For example, when... It is very common that demonstrations are covered by the news media. Quite simply: On which side of the camera am I standing? Demonstrators aren't usually angels. They are usually hot-blooded, wrathful, they protest against something. If I'm opposed to them, then they might be projecting an obnoxious image on screen, especially when a fight ensues and I see them as being aggressive. When I stand on the other side, I probably witness police brutality. Where does that come from... Private sector. You? I worked for a company, wait a minute, I earned 7000 forints per month. Half of my salary was deducted. - I can't get by on 3500 forints. - Give me a break! I worked for a fucking company, and what did I get? - The same thing I got. - Listen. It got a lot better... - Insurance company? - Did you build a house? the bank, and two families. So what? - Gyula, listen, dependents? - Me too, I'm separated? Don't have a home, a job, nothing. I can't even count how many... How many of them I have to pay... You're better off than me financially, huh? I'm in a private enterprise. I earn more. - You earn more. All right. - And I don't spend that much. I have some pending matters with the police so I have to work in a state-owned company. - That's different. - I have to. You know what that means? If I find employment and earn, let's say, my nominal salary. Seven? - Yes, 8000 forints. - Jeno, shut up! - 8000? - You earn ten thousand. Ten. So? - Average? - Yeah. - In Hungary? - Why not? You can make a living. - 7000, 7000. - Listen, listen, I... - Taking the piss... - In 2500-2800 ?F... I've been a boilermaker, forklift operator, everything. I'm a fucking iron founder, listen here. Cheers! You know what? Don't drink! - Your family is likely to get more. - It's private sector, so shut your gob! You know what? Pubs should be closed. You work in the fucking private sector. Close the pubs! I won't drink then. Or smoke. Wait a minute! Stop! The notice on this Labourer pack says: "Smoking may damage your health." On every pack. Why are those in circulation? Cigarettes should be made illegal! I wouldn't smoke. Smokeless Symphonia has been invented. They should sell those, not these! Are you a labourer, or not? - What? - Labourer, or not? I am a labourer, yes. Sorry. I have to leave early. For Munich. I've just received a phone call. I can't attend your birthday party. - You have to? - Uh-huh. Postpone it! I can't. - I'll make it up to you, okay? - When? Three days approximately. Marx's remarkable Feuerbach thesis says that "Philosophers have hitherto only interpreted the world in various ways; the point is to change it." I think that these these theories are unable to accomplish what reality can accomplish by itself. What love can harmonically... okay, "harmonic" is an exaggeration, but what can be accomplished by love, what is singular in love: sensuality and paradise, heaven and earth, body and soul... These are separated only in theory. This dichotomy, through and through. To the very end... an attempt at appropriating one of them, either the sensual or the celestial... an attempt at defending them, or rather the unification of these two things, is capable of merging completely contradictory theories, extreme realities, emotional conditions, and that is reality itself: love. So it is not theory but reality that helps us out. Chip Chip is the proof of this in my life. Chip is the one in whom all sorts of mutually exclusive, astoundingly contrary opportunities existed, and still exist somehow... Chip was... once upon a time... before I got to know her was this girl. This girl could've become anyone. She could've been the greatest woman in the world. When I became acquainted with her, she was already somebody else, immersed in a different world. Beauty determines us as we know it, and it determines in the wrong direction. Chip... ??? She's missed the boat. This intrigues me the most in our relationship, actually. That... somehow, by my intervention... Anyhow, due to our relationship she started pursuing good opportunities. What can be found in this photograph started to materialize. Sure, there's some Pygmalion effect in this thing, of course. I feel like Professor Higgins sometimes. Thus Chip is my work too. And I think the gist of this thing is this metamorphosis. During these couple of years, Chip was very? What are you doing? Stop! Open the door! You're crazy! Open it! Where are you going? Open the door! He locked the door on us. I'm going to kill you, you bastard! Why are you sobbing, woman? Stop it already for God's sake! Here's this creep again... ...Had she lived in the 18th century... ...the panic within... Because of the general outcry against hanging, the electric chair was the next step. Its premier was in New York during the year 1890. Larry DeSilva would soon join the list of criminals that have died in this fashion. It's time. DeSilva had read about the method. When asked if he was afraid, he smiled. When he was led to the execution chamber, DeSilva seemed nervous and totally disoriented. He was scared to die. When I asked him if he ever thought about the woman he had murdered, he replied, "All I wanted was her goddamn wallet and the bitch gave me a hard time." DeSilva's history in crime was a lengthy one. At 34, 17 of those years were spent in penal institutions. Beginning with petty theft, DeSilva finally committed a crime which would cost him his life. The process is simple. The victim is placed in a chair where electrodes are attached to his leg and head. These two areas are sponged down beforehand with a brine solution to conduct electricity. Strapped to a seat that you will never leave alive is a situation that I still cannot justify. A man on death row is in a continuous fight for his life. When finally tied to the chair, the condemned knows that death results. During the final preparations, one could feel the fear being transmitted from his body. Even though he committed an inexcusable crime, I began to wonder if two wrongs really make a right. His eyes are taped to prevent them from popping out of their sockets. The flick of a switch sends a current of 2,000 volts through the electrodes. Then the current is brought down to 1,000 volts after a few seconds. By this point, the man is unconscious and the whole process is repeated until the prisoner is proclaimed dead by the physician on duty. The room began to smell like burning flesh. The physician has them repeat the process. The trickle of blood marked the conclusion to this grotesque execution. If this is the only solution for certain problems, modern society will be plagued by violence. INTERMISSION This was the most important incident in the history of the royal family.

WHAT IS COMING? DOCUMENTALIST, Part II Yes. Understood. We've already discussed this, don't you understand? Yes, with you. I've talked this over with your boss. That's what I've been saying. We've negotiated with the Japanese. The co-operative would manufacture them. You ought to take charge of the commercial part, and we're ready. I don't get it. How can you come up with a new version? We had an agreement! Everything is fine. I've told you already. Now that everything falls into place you quit? What are you doing here? Why did you come here? Have you completely lost your mind? I've told you already. I can stand anything in the whole wide world except for one thing: that you kiss him in front of me. - I cannot tolerate that. - He's my husband, can't you understand? I don't care. Dump him! I still owe him something, don't you get it? After all he's done for us, you still ask why? I'll sell the house, as it is. Come with me. Leave him! - I can't stand him. Listen... - It hurts, stop it! You know it's very hard. Do you think this is easy for me? Please, cut it out, I beg you, stop doing that! You're insane. - Bye. - That's very kind of you. I love you.

You understand the context. The Iran-Iraq war, and these idiots with the peace treaty... Viz. the thing is ?No thanks. I don't smoke. When there's war, the dollar goes up, when there are no riflemen, it goes down again. And uh... I don't know what to expect. If this goes on, it means no Christmas for the children. I lost $700 last week. It's not that funny, you know. You think this is a joke, but every day at one o'clock when the Bundesbank determines the par value of the dollar, I turn on the TV immediately and I watch what will happen because it might go up. And the dollar went up for one day only, when the Iranians shot the Americans. And I thought I was not going to convert the dollar, because the Yankees might fire back, but they didn't. So as it turned out the next day, the dollar went down again seven pfennige. Seven pfennige. That means I lost DM 3500 that day. I can't foretell what will happen. So the only, uh... This tension every day; It depends on a stupid thing like that, when I can't do anything myself, I'm defenceless. One can at least do something here, but you're completely at the mercy of events there. So... Who the hell knows? What are you doing? Are you recording this whole nonsense? I work in the Ministry of Interior, you record this thing and want to screen it again? ...this ABC news special My father, Gordon MacRae, was one of the biggest musical theatre stars and an alcoholic.

The culture of democracy is not restricted to the political sphere, it has to pervade all territories of human relations. Our basic idea is that socialism is a society where people's opinions, social network and pursuits are more and more varied. Each man has his own social experience, level of knowledge, qualification, the unique perception of the developments. Hence the wide variety of opinions, convictions, assessments, which of course demand attention, accounts and the discerning of coherence. We are in favour of the diversity of social opinions, the abundance of culture. No need to be afraid of publicly addressing the arduous problems of societal growth, the criticism and debates. In fact, justice is established and right decisions are made under circumstances like these. Socialist democracy must fully serve the needs of working men. Comrades! The solid foundation of the accelerated progress can be secured on the basis of fundamental economic changes, moreover, even the reconstruction picks up only when it stirs up our economy thoroughly and that requires the radical alteration of the economic mechanism, the whole economic governance. The goal of the pivotal economic reform initiated in this country is to secure a transition in two or three years from the unduly centralized, domineering governance to the democratic system which is principally based upon economic methods: on the optimal coordination of centralism and self-government. It is a radical crisis. If the establishment can't be reformed, the Hungarian economy will be threatened by marginalization, the peril of a long decline. An imminent burst is an entirely different matter. There may be a chance of becoming insolvent, but it can be evaded. These are not high-probability odds. There's a serious danger that these unfavourable processes ?especially under highly bureaucratized governance? can become irreversible sooner or later, and are very hard to terminate. Amongst the consequences, economic problems might transform into social unrest or in any event, lethargy. In every notable group ?notable considering economic performance... in the state bureaucracy, managers, in every group participating in the preparation of the economic policy incredulity and distrust are widespread... There was a medium-term economic plan ?the first experience like that in my life? when the designers (including the monetary experts, not the Planbureau) didn't believe in the possibility of the plan reaching completion. This is the seventh Five Year Plan which is a symptomatic phenomenon when even those experts who were participating in the groundwork of the economic policy start to think that this whole process is a meaningless, aimless effort indeed. I find that an extraordinarily serious thing. It can extinguish the ethos and morals of any work; an outfit like that can become unable to achieve reform. The condition we call consensus according to the official political slang, is, as a matter of fact, an inactive condition. The essence of this was that, after 1956, the political power offered the population the opportunity of a modest pecuniary gain, and said that in turn they don't have to conduct political activity. And the populace, the free people loved this immensely after all. They didn't realize during their exultation that they couldn't have even talked politics. We are in need of a new consensus which is, based on the foregoing, in exchange of, and accepting that the introduction of consolidation and reform entail the decline of living standards, a reconciliation would be brought about with the society which states that the establishment accepts that the society engages in politics and tries to defend its interests, and the society claims that prerogative in return for the decline of living standards. The other delusion is that the deteriorating situation can extort the reform. I think our collective Central or Eastern European experience is that the deteriorating situation can coerce lots of things: political rabble-rousing, emergency... it can introduce lots of things. It can't coerce a reform. The Hungarian reform experiences also show us that the failure of reform ideas and ambitions can be traced back to the fact that there wasn't a social force behind the reform thought which could've forced out and implemented the reform even when the establishment was hesitating. There is a risk that the Hungarian society, which has no accurate information about the actual state of affairs, which thinks that this thing is somehow avoidable? Trouble will come, they said, but it can always be avoided somehow. We can't get away with the next couple of years like we did with the previous ones, so with the sudden dissipation of illusions a revolt without a plan wouldn't crop up, and a revolt without a plan is usually followed by retaliations without plans. ...the turn of the century ?it would be worth investigating, but I don't want to drag on about how many series of shocks and traumas struck the Hungarian society whose ultimate result was that they transformed it into a nation shaken and shattered in its moral position, awareness and national consciousness. From Trianon to the '56ers, these traumas had been piling up and not been resolved. After '56, due to this growth ?the country experienced this as individual self-realization initially, and later as national self-realization of a certain kind. When a Hungarian was asked what did being a Hungarian mean to him in the Fifties, what was he proud of, he replied: the Golden Team. When asked in surveys in the Sixties, or particularly the Seventies, the Golden Team still held the first place, or Laci Papp, and the second was that we're better off than the Polish and the Romanians. That meant that the national self-realization had one, or rather a sole dimension. A one-dimensional national consciousness has evolved, replacing a completely severed one. One-dimensional national consciousness. Our nation is going to lose this sole dimension in the next couple of years ?which I think is a great risk? so I think that a nation with a sound national consciousness can't be shaken or brought into an unstable plight by even bigger crises. When we think about '56, the establishment was astounded by the scale of this explosion, they didn't expect anything like that. Think about Karoly Kis in Csepel, 22 October, when he said that if anything happened, it would be over in no time, would peter out in about half an hour. And what happened? The administration was overthrown in hours. This shows that exactly these mechanisms and mental factors were operating which weren't accounted for by the establishment, and I fear that no one takes this into account again. We're deliberating about dimensions where these moduli were ruled out. And rightly so, we cannot treat society as mere manufacturers, consumers, tax-paying civilians, but as individuals who carry the national consciousness. And when a mass trauma sets in all kinds of absurd things can happen. I'd like this one, please. 2000 forints, Sir. Good afternoon. One moment, please. - Shall I wrap it up? - No, thank you. Here's your video. See you soon! Good afternoon! May I help you? I'd like to talk to the owner. One sec, I'll get him. Turn off the TV, Miss! - Why? - I don't like it. - He's not here? - It seems like he's not here. I don't know. He doesn't answer. Let's go upstairs then! One moment gentlemen! What were you thinking? - Why? - The badge is not enough. - A document... - Show her the search warrant! - Is this sufficient? - All right. Let's go then! Let's smoke! This is about us. Uh-huh. Bela! Take this apart! I would like to have a private conversation with you. Send us another car! Bela, give me that TDK! Yeah. We need this. What the hell is going on? Boss! The sex life of the working-class woman. - Beautiful, isn't it? - Yes. Damn it. Disseminating culture, eh? Do you have matches? She has admirable breasts though. Look at this score! Caligula. Rambo. Have you seen it? I have the third film, but there's a fourth part, too. Is that a black woman? Look! Fantastic, but we haven't found what we're looking for. We're not doing what is really important. The schoolteacher hasn't been raised to the appropriate level. Thus, the guidance. Lenin continues: "Given the national budget's structure, if we want to implement a cultural revolution, we must expend the whole budget on school education." No one says those two can be realized simultaneously, but anyway, this guidance is brave, revolutionary and profoundly true. It is feasible, but the customs, everyday life, prejudice, bureaucratic routine and the spontaneous forces of servility militate against the feasibility. I consider myself superior to the average, and I do want to differ from them. I know that equal opportunities don't exist, and I know that my daughter's opportunities are unlike other average girls' opportunities, and I don't want to revoke these special advantages... the privileges. Exactly forty years ago at Cecilienhof, in Potsdam, after the victorious Big Three's first summit, Harry Truman, the new American president received a top secret radiogram about the birth of a so-called "baby". Truman knew that the message from the Los Alamos site was about the Little Boy, i.e. the first atomic bomb in world history, for which he immediately gave orders to deploy. We're walking under the flags. Our song promulgates the future. The people united will never be defeated! This is the first parliamentary election when 5-7% of all votes were cast against Ceausescu in the country's key counties. In the popular democratic electoral system, where a 99% victory is considered normal, 5-7% votes against him is like a loss. The Conducator, as they say, was deeply shocked by the election result. He felt personally insulted, but he receives the coronation regalia. This presidential sceptre, introduced twelve years ago is unique in the communist world. It symbolizes that Ceausescu doesn't only regard himself as the governor or party leader. Romanians are proud of their historic ties with ancient Rome. Ceausescu sets himself up as the guardian and conservator of this historical heritage. As the Conducator, he regards himself as the direct descendant of the Roman emperors, a latter-day caesar. The menace, which threatens the whole country didn't emerge from the dark wilderness of Erdely, but from within: Ceausescu's character. The carefree family scene is deceptive. It appears that Ceausescu is impelled by some kind of inner urge to compensate for the miseries and indignities of the previous years with something else besides sumptuous villas. He's not content with the power alone. He aspires to grandeur, fame, international recognition, greeted by rounds of applause, ovation. Whichever way he turns, he wants to "pick" panegyrics as if they were flowers. He'll be summoned for tomorrow. It was a breeding ground for both the Japanese and West German economic miracles. We've been defeated, but... the '45 structure is what we're referring to. In essence, it was the structure of the Soviet army's supply, to which the first three-year plan had already provided military capacities. There is no other way to imagine that the exact information Gero gave including how much coal and steel, tons of... it could've been determined differently, not with calculations made by Chiefs of Staff. At that time, however, Chiefs of Staff calculations were based on the technology of World War II, and our technical capacity assurance did not prove to be good enough, and what is not in the defence industry's budget, but... so it's not the Ministry of Defence? But in the defence industry's budget. We don't know anything about this. We know, workers say there are "chocolate factories" here and there, that's how they call those institutions? And if we don't have enough information... So much... balderdash! You see? ...and we can't provide an estimate, we can still make very close approximate classical calculations. Saying that if as much as about 2-3% of the male workforce are under arms ?since wartime economy exists, according to the first wartime economies,? it takes about 10 to 15 people in the hinterland to supply a single soldier. We know how to judge... the defense plans roughly, but... My assertion is, as it has been pointed out by other such statistics, that it is simply not measured because of the secrecy. They're not aware of the expenses. Once upon a time, in the humane, pristine era, when you killed your fellow human beings only if you wanted to when they fought man against man, so much to kill each other. Later, when the Romans organized legions and taught men the art of killing, then a man might have killed 10-12 men by the time he died. In the Second World War we got to the point when appr. an English worker's 2-3 month salary was the price of someone's life, nowadays we can kill someone without spending a penny. It would be nice if your husband showed up at our place at eight o'clock. Is this enough or shall I give it in writing? I would insist on the writing. I like it when formalities are adhered to. I would insist on the writing. I like it when formalities are adhered to. Certainly! Should I leave? I think so. Don't you have a better idea? I do. Five years. I'd choose this. You're cute darling. You're really cute. Bye, my darling. You didn't have Rambo handle this, which evinces mental subtlety. After five years, you deserve this. Thanks. Cinema is not about life going by. People don?t want to see that. Huh? Hollywood, Hollywood, never been a place people had it so good like Hollywood. I made ten movies, you know? What do you do with your days, my friend? About ten times, several times the same story I was saying. What do you do with your nights, my friend? In the beginning it was easy because I just went from shot to shot. - But now in the morning - ...with your wife, my friend? I'm scared. Now I know how to tell stories. - Unrelentlessly. - ...your life, my friend... As the story comes in, life sneaks out. Life sneaks out? What did they do with your head, my friend? Everything gets pressured into images. - When did you learn you were dead...? - Mechanism. Birth, as all stories can end, all stories are about death. The messengers of death. Death, Fritz. It?s what it?s all about. It?s the biggest story in the world. Second best only to love stories. Time for all good survivors to say goodbye, eh? - An Oldsmobile? - Yeah. What loony would get a huge thing like that in Hungary? An Oldsmobile? In Hungary? ...the significant difference is that during the stability phase, the chance of economic development is subject to strict conditions, the proportion of distribution is different and fewer resources are available to realize the objectives of the standard of living and social policy. The government's work programme should not aim at solving all accumulated stress, but it can help adapt to the new world economy, it can ward off the risk of greater disparity compared to developed countries and to take sides in favour of speeding up the predetermined economic and social reform processes. The Central Committee's decision of November last year and July this year, on which the government's work programme was established, is the continuation and renewal of a bold and progressive policy that lifted the country out of the tragedy of 1956, created socialist agriculture, announced and introduced economic reform and embarked on the path to develop socialist democracy. We desperately need to keep this spirit of the policy, to face the accumulated problems of the economy and the political institutions with similar candidness and to act with the same determination as in the periods of these great upheavals. This determination is necessary to overcome economic difficulties, the disruption of the society and its institutions, to do away with the depletion of ideological life and the uncertainty of the politicizing layers of society. Listen to me! Hey! Don't hurt him! Hey... The mouse scampers to Gorbachev and says "Gorbachev, gimme some vodka!" He says "I've told you, there's no vodka, alcoholism is no more"?
