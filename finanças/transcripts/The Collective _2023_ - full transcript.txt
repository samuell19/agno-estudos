[arrows whizzing] [arrow thuds] [uplifting music] [dramatic music] [uplifting music] [dramatic music] [bird cawing] [Neely] Please. [Neely] Help me. [breathing heavily] [Neely] Help me. [grunts] [dramatic music continues] [grunting] [cage rattling] [grunts] [mumbling] [mumbling] [Neely] Please let me, please let me out. [Neely] Please let me out. Please, please, please let me out of here, please. [shudders] Please help. [footsteps clomping] [Neely] What do you want? What do you want? [grunts] Yes, Mr. Neely, Mr. Neely. [cage rattles] Bet you didn't think you'd end up here, did you? No. Tell me about yourself, you're a world class hacker. Maybe a first rate... [Miro] analyst. A greedy analyst. What is it? What is it? What is it you do, Mr. Neely? Please, okay? I will cooperate with you. I, I will tell you whatever you want. Anything you want to know. [suspenseful music] I don't give a fuck what you know. I really don't. Means nothing to me. It's what you're worth. Hmm. Apparently, it's allowed you've made some powerful enemies my friend. [Neely] I'm, I'm sorry. Okay? I never meant to hurt anyone. -[Miro] No. -Okay, I just I saw the numbers, -they were off. -[Miro] The numbers. [Neely] And I just, I just. -[Miro] Were off. -[Neely] Mhmm. You're gonna make me a rich man, Mr. Neely. [Miro] Where was he? -He was at-- -At home. [Miro] You were at home? What were you doing at home eating popcorn watching... cartoon reruns? [chuckling] That's really stupid. [Miro] You're stupid. [suspenseful music continues] Stupid, Mr. Neely. A moron. [Daisy clears throat] Just a moron. The Collective are getting close to finding us. They're nothing to worry about for the moment. They only have one operative in Boston. [dramatic music] You sure he's the only one? Yes, I got into their system last night. Will they send more? [Daisy] If they do, I'll know about it. [dramatic music continues] We still have that apartment? [Daisy] Yes, sir. [footsteps clomping] Send them a bad tip. A set up, a meeting, a trap. I don't want to hear about him again. Nikita, can you set that up? I'll send some guys. [cage clanks] -[cage clanking] -[Neely] Okay, look. Send some guys. So what do I do about this one? This one? Mr. Neely. [exhales] It looks kind of cozy in there, actually. Like a little rat. A little rat, sort of whistleblower, isn't it? [lips squeaking] Little rat? Give the rat some cheese. -[footsteps clomping] -[Nikita] Coming right up. [cage clanking] [cage clanking] [dramatic music] [dramatic music continues] [dramatic music continues] -[dramatic music continues] -[birds chirping] [footsteps clomping] [birds cawing and chirping] -[suspenseful music] -[footsteps clomping] [gun clicks] [bird cawing] [wings flapping] -[suspenseful music continues] -[footsteps clomping] [footsteps clomping] [foliage rustling] -[suspenseful music continues] -footsteps clomping] [gun clicks] -[feet thud] -[guards grunt] -[silenced gunshots] -[bodies thud] [dramatic music] -[silenced gunshot] -[body thuds] -[silenced gunshot] -[body thuds] -[Sam grunts] -[gun thuds] -[body thuds] -[both grunting] -[gun clicks] -[silenced gunshot] -[patio door sliding] -[silenced gunshot] -[guard grunts] -[body thuds] -[feet thud] -[silenced gunshot] [duct tape stretching] [dramatic music continues] [boxes shuffling] [Sam breathing heavily] [dramatic music continues] -[silenced gunshot] -[body thuds] -[body thuds] -[silenced gunshots] [boxes shuffle] [silenced gunshots] -[silenced gunshot] -[body thuds] [Beard] Please. Please, please. Please, please don't kill me. I'll pay you way more than they will. -[silenced gunshot] -[blood squirts] [gun clicks] [camera shutters] -[hand thuds] -[garage door cranking] [dramatic music continues] Nice time. [Liam] The fastest I've seen. [Liam] Let's check your work. Dead. Dead. Definitely dead. Dead. Maybe. [silenced gunshot] How 'bout now? And the target? [Liam] Good. Very good. That's not so great. -[gun clicks] -Yeah, it's not fatal. Fatal or not. Could distract you. Could take you out of the game even for a second. That could be the difference. Otherwise, good job. All right. Everybody. Say hello to the newest member of The Collective. -[Liam] Sam Alexander. -[all applauding] Welcome. Sic casus praecipuus. May the privilege fall. [Liam] That's not just a motto. That's code. -Don't forget it. -I won't. [Sam] So, when's my first assignment? -Excuse me? -[Sam] Soon, or? [Sam] You know, because I could go right now. [Liam] Good. Glad to hear it. [Liam] You start in the office tomorrow. You still got a lot to learn about the organization. [dramatic music] [car door slams] [car door slams] [dramatic music continues] [Sam] This is it? This place looks like shit. -[dog barking] -[footsteps clomping] [door slams] [footsteps clomping] [Sam] Hi. -Hi! Name? -Sam Alexander. Do you have an appointment? -Yes. -With who? Dr. Casus. [keyboard clicking] Can I see your confirmation? [sighs] Yeah. [keyboard clicking] -Huh. I, um. -[keyboard clicking] I don't see you in the system. I'm new. -Um. -[keyboard clicking] [suspenseful music] Is uh, something wrong? [suspenseful music continues] [Liam] Oh, hey, Sam. [Liam] There you are. -He's with me. -[footsteps clomping] [Liam] First day. -Welcome. -Thanks. Well then, welcome to The Collective. We'll make him a file later, but go ahead and activate his pen. Sorry I didn't get you in the system yet. -You scared her. -Oh, all good. [Liam] You're lucky you got your legs. Oh, while you're in here, um, make sure you wear your pin. Because the doors have sensors and can read the microchip from inside. [footsteps clomping] And here we got the control centre. Each one of the controllers are the eyes and ears of every agent in the field. -[dramatic music] -[footsteps clomping] -Door on the left. -Hold on. There are seven guys on the other side of that door. -Proceed with caution. -Careful. There's an alarm. Let me just disarm it. [keyboard clicking] All right. [Liam] And this is where the collective decides which contracts to send up the chain. You'll start here. Doing paperwork? We all start somewhere, Sam. Good luck. -[dramatic music continues] -[footsteps clomping] [sighs] [body thuds] So you're the one that beat my time on the training course. You're a little old, no? [Robert] I'm Robert. And that's Barbara. [Robert] Not that you will, But if you need anything, we'd be happy to help. I'd be happy to help. Can you tell me how long I'll be staying in contracts? Field agents always start here. If you're desperate for some action, you can move to control. [sighs] Sorry. Didn't just leave my desk job so I could work another desk job. [folder thuds] Then you'll put in the time like the rest of us. What's your background? [gentle music] [sighs] [desk thuds] I worked for the DA. -[Barbara chuckles] -[Robert] Oh. Really? So you're an attorney? I was. And then I got bored. I don't see how that translates into wet work. You watch enough guilty people walk free and eventually you want to go out there and take care of them yourself. [Robert] Hmm. Very proactive. Look, I get that. But don't be so anxious to get out there. The training course is one thing, but the real world, would eat you alive. -I'm not so sure about that. -[papers shuffling] We'll see. -[Robert whispers] Barb. [dramatic music] [folder thuds] [dramatic music continues] [birds chirping] [Hugo] But if we wait, We're gonna miss our chance at getting Neely and all of his intel. Can't afford to lose you either. If we have the shot, we have to take it. Come on, Hugo. It's not Bin Laden. We're gonna get another chance. [Hugo] Yes, at Miro. But if we wait, we'll miss our chance at getting Neely. [sighs] All right. Well, give us a day to verify the reports, get a schematic of the building, and I'll hook you up with a controller. No, there's no time. Because we don't know how soon until he auctions Neely. [dramatic music continues] You know I'm right. Of course you are. It's an apartment building. [Hugo] With two elevators, two sets of stairs, and four escape routes. Can't be that easy. Miro hasn't been caught yet for a reason. Because I haven't tried yet. All right. You're too damn stubborn for this conversation to go anywhere. So I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. I will let you go in there, not because I want to, because I know you're gonna do it anyway. Anything else? Yeah. Do you want anything special said at your funeral? You're not invited to my funeral. Oh, I, I wasn't coming anyway. So, do we have a deal? [keyboard clicks] [dramatic music continues] -[footsteps clomping] -Hey, Sam. You got a minute? [folder thuds] [footsteps clomping] -[door knocks] -[door clicks] [Liam] Come in, Sam. Sit down. [door slams] Take a look at that file. I'd like to hear your thoughts. Out loud, please. Okay. Miro Lindell. He's a notorious human trafficking kingpin. He's in bed with billionaires, politicians, law enforcement, you name it. Basically untouchable. So is he? Untouchable? No. Nobody's untouchable. [Sam sighs] [Sam] If anything, seems a little too easy. There's no special security protocols outside of a detail. I mean, at most, you're facing guards at the ground level and at the apartment. All right, so what would you do? Are you asking me if I want this? I'm asking for your thoughts. I go in at night, late at night, when the least civilians are around. -[car whirring] -[dramatic music] [Sam] It's an apartment building, so. Ground level guards would be less conspicuous. [Sam] Lookouts assessing who comes and goes. [dramatic music continues] I'm somewhat of a master of disguise, so. Master of disguise, huh? Somewhat. Anyway, I walk right in without firing a shot. [dramatic music continues] [body thuds] [body thuds] [gunshots firing] [body thuds] [dramatic music continues] Okay. You're in the building now. What's next? Well, you need access to the elevator. Lucky for us, the controller could easily hack into it. -[dramatic music continues] -[elevator dings] -[Hugo grunts] -[body thuds] -[body thuds] -[guard grunts] [guard grunts] [body thuds] -[body thuds] -[Hugo grunts] -[body thuds] -[guard grunts] -[body thuds] -[guard grunts] Quick, clean, and simple. There would be guards in the hallway. I would keep my distance and, try and take them out before they engage. [guard chattering] -[gunshot fires] -[guard grunts] -[body thuds] -[gunshot fires] [dramatic music continues] [weapons fumbling] -[gunshots firing] -[bodies thud] I'd be especially careful about the guards located outside the front door. That's where I'd put my toughest guys. [dramatic music continues] [guns click] [door thuds] [gunshots firing] -[gunshots firing] -[bullets whizzing] -[gunshot fires] -[body thuds] [guard grunts] [dramatic music continues] It's all downhill from there. [folder thuds] It's a good plan, on paper. What does your gut say? [sighs] It's a trap. [dramatic music continues] [footsteps clomping] [both grunting] -[both grunting] -[body thuds] -[guard choking] -[gun clicking] [guard panting] [Hugo mutters] -[gunshots firing] -[guard grunting] [gun clicks] -[body thuds] -[gunshot fires] -[body crunches] -[Hugo grunts] [both grunting] [gunshots firing] [both grunting] -[body thuds] -[gun clanks] [body thuds] [gun clanks] -[gunshot fires] -[body thuds] -[gunshot fires] -[body thuds] [dramatic music continues] Field work is rarely simple. One has to be prepared to improvise. [folder thuds] That kind of training takes time. Well, how can I learn when I'm stuck here doing contracts? [tense music] Stuck? Sam, it's your first day. You want me on this assignment, don't you? I promise I can get it done. [tense music continues] [keyboard clicking] Go back to work. [keyboard clicking] [tense music continues] [door clicks] [door slams] [tense music continues] -[clears throat] -[keyboard clicking] [dramatic music] [car whirring] [dramatic music continues] [birds chirping] [sighs] [phone vibrates] Amazing. You're alive. He wasn't there. [Liam] Fuck. There were men waiting for me. Well, that means they're in our system. You're compromised. How can you let this happen? [Liam] I would say it was Neely. He clearly has more intel on us than we realized. We have to pull you out. No, not happening. Well, it's not safe anymore. [Hugo] We need Neely. Well, if he knows about you and he knows about all of our other agents, how are we going to get him if he can see us coming? Then what do you suggest? It's pretty obvious to me that we need someone that's not in our system.

Who are you? I'm, uh, Sam. Can I come in? Why haven't I seen you before? Liam sent me, I'm, uh, new. You, uh, gonna let me in or what? Grab the shit. -[bag thuds] -It's a nice place. This way. [door slams] [bag rolling] Put things in here. [bag thuds] [bag zips] I don't need guns. I got plenty here. Yeah, but I figured I'd be prepared anyways. [Hugo] What's that? Disguise. Handbook said to bring one. I'm Miami Vice, don't you think? [Hugo] You don't need a grenade. It's never good. Fuck around and blow up the wrong shit. I use it while I'm training. So, I just kind of figured it would be a... [Hugo] You heard what I said, right? [Sam clears throat] [Sam] Yeah. -[hands clap] -All right. So. When do we get started? Slow down. I don't know you. Okay. What do you want to know? All right, I guess I can just... [scoffs] From New Jersey. I just got this pin three days ago, so I guess you could say this is my first assignment. And I used to work for the district attorney's office. And now I'm here. So no military, CIA, special ops background, nothing? No. I mean, I trained martial arts. [clears throat] I did karate. [eerie music] Karate? [Hugo] So you're useless to me. [scoffs] Listen, you clearly don't want me here, but I'm here. I'm not on the books. So Miro couldn't possibly know about me. So, until I die, or Liam sends me home, I'm staying. [sighs] We both want the same thing. [Sam] I'm telling you, we do. You need me to take down Miro. Sic casus praecipuus. Let's make him fall. Do you even know what that means? Yeah. Do you? I made up the fucking slogan. Oh. [Hugo] You and your yellow belt. -Follow me. -My bad. Where are we going? [Hugo] This way. [footsteps clomping] [footsteps clomping] [Hugo] You've never seen this room. [Hugo] This is the war room. Liam and I, have countless operations, from here. Even toppling governments. Toppling governments? The CIA have a list of enemies that they consider untouchable. [Hugo] People like Miro. Liam and I got sick of ignoring the root of the problem. So we left. And started The Collective. [Hugo] Our targets think they are above the law. So we speak for the innocent. Judge, jury and executioner. And now we take down Miro. No. No? What about the apartment? I wasn't there for Miro. I was there to get Christopher Neely. [dramatic music] [Hugo] He's our target. He's an analyst. He's leaked information about billionaires buying elections. Now, Miro has him hostage. He's planning to sell him to the highest bidder. That's fifty million? Really? He'll probably sell him for more than that. Pissed off a lot of people. Okay, so why are we involved? Christopher is key to taking down the untouchables. All right then. Let's go find him. It's not that easy. We don't know where he is. I read Miro's file. -[board taps] -He would keep him close. He's constantly moving. He travels all over. [keyboard clicking] Hosting human auctions. [keyboard clicking] And only untouchables get invited. Okay. [keyboard clicking] [Sam] Maybe we can find one. [dramatic music continues] What are you doing? A little background research. Picked it up working for the DA. And this is the exact type of guy Miro would reach out to, George Lee. And he'd want revenge for Barry Vanderstorm's death. He'd pay about anything for it. [dramatic music continues] [keyboard clicking] And guess who's in town? I'm guessing the auction is somewhere around this area. Looks like we're going to the beach. [dramatic music continues] What? Why not? Well, if Miro finds out about this. Which he will. And you'll be made, too. Yeah, but we have to try. I mean, capture this guy and then get the auction info out of him. Then one of Miro's clients goes missing, and he knows It's not worth jeopardizing the mission. [sighs] What if the auction's tonight? You got a better idea? Give me your pen. [Sam] What? Give it to me. [Sam] Yeah. [dramatic music continues] [Sam] Are you, uh, controlling for me? I'm making sure you don't die. Thanks. -[Hugo] I'm gonna activate em'. -[device beeps] [Hugo] These are my eyes and ears. And when you get back, I'm gonna teach you the pistol puppet. The pistol puppet? Wear this. [dramatic music continues] [items clatter] Uh, one more thing. I'm gonna need to borrow your car. [Sam] I don't have one. -[keys thud] -[dramatic music continues] [footsteps clomping] [mouse clicking] [dramatic music continues] They're here. [door clicks] [door slams] Give me your thing, baby. Do your thing. That's it. [George] That is it. Yeah. Gosh, you're so hot. I should have brought two cameras. This is amazing. Look at you. [bird chirping] That is amazing. Yeah. Yeah, do this like, [blows] like that. [George] Shooting from the hip. Boom, boom, boom. [chuckles] Love it. [bird chirps] You saw how you could bring MySpace back with these pictures. [camera clicks] So what's your plan? I'm gonna get behind cover. Take the guards out one at a time. No good. [Sam] But it's clean. Right. So you shoot the first guy. They all notice. Then what? I take them out. You take them out. And you waste your time. So you want to just show up and start shooting? It's called an ambush, and it works. That's it. Beautiful. Now, can you do the thing where you turn around and like, look over your shoulder. [George] Oh, yeah, that's it. Oh, down from your knees. I like it. Look at you. [George] You're a pro. Wow. Wow. [Hugo] Walk on to the beach, then draw. I'm staying here. [bird chirps] Pistols are only good [Hugo] from a certain distance. [Sam] I'm going to get behind cover. [Sam] I'm going to take out the guards one at a time. Not accurately. [George] Hey. That was great. You're amazing. One, two. -Three. -[gun fires] -[body thuds] -[gun fires] [gun fires] -[bullet ricochets] -Dammit. -[dramatic music] -[guns firing] Should have been closer. -[guns firing] -[bullets ricochet] Not now! -[gun fires] -[body thuds] [dramatic music continues] -[guns firing] -[bullets ricochet] -[guns firing] -[body thuds] Get behind cover! -[gun thuds] -[gun fires] [guns firing] -[body thuds] -[guns firing] [gun fires] [Hugo] Sam! Sam? Sam? -[Hugo] Sam? -Yeah, I'm here. [George] Oh. What was that? [George groans] -[footsteps clomping] -[gun clicks] -[gun fires] -[George grunts] -[dramatic music continues] -[birds chirping] [Hugo] Flip him over. Oh, God. Please don't kill me. -[George whimpers] -Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! You understand? Need to hurry. Miro Lindell. You know him? -All right, okay, [shushes]. -[George whimpers] [Sam] I know you're here for the auction. What time is it? -Auction? -[gun clicks] -[body thuds] -[George grunts] -What time is it? -I don't know. -[George grunts] -[Sam] You see that? That's how you're going to look if you lie to me one more time. [George pants] [George] Saturday. -[George] Saturday? Six. -What time? Which six? Six a.m., six in the morning! -Please don't hurt me. -Okay, good. Where is it? [George] I don't know. I promise. I swear. I don't know. They, they don't send the address until an hour before. Just aim your camera so I can see into his eyes. [dramatic music] [Hugo] He's telling the truth. [Hugo] He's scared, but he never broke eye contact. You're going to have to kill him now. [sighs] What? He can identify you. Do it now. Don't overthink this. Wait, wait, wait, no! [gun fires] [Sam panting] Yep. That's what blood and brains look like. [Hugo] Take a picture. Short is a price on his head. And grab his phone. We got to be ready to attack the moment a text comes through. Time to come back. We got a lot of work to do. What the fuck is taking you so long? We don't know where he is. This entire auction is going to implode -if you can't figure out the-- -[Daisy] Found him. I guess the apartment ambush wasn't a complete failure. In Massachusetts, he goes by the alias of Mark Vorhee, or Vorhee. The CCTV captured him parking and walking into the apartment building. Where's the car registered? [Daisy] It's close. Good. I got somebody who knows what the fuck they're doing. Why are you still standing here? Go. [dramatic music] [insects buzzing] [footsteps clomping] -[glass thuds] -[Hugo] Top that off for you. [liquid pours] [glasses clink] How you holding up? [sighs] I lost control. [clears throat] That's never happened to me before. [Hugo sips] A hundred thousand for your first kill. Not too shabby. [sighs] I want to make sure I clarify something. Liam, he's a stone cold killer. Not to be fucked with. [Hugo] He would kill four or five people, and two hours later, we'd sit and eat dinner, and he's laughing like nothing ever happened. [gentle music] Fucking nuts. I remember back. My first kill. In the CIA. It wasn't the kill that kept me up at night. It was the sound of his fractured skull. That shit plays in my mind over and over and over again. But you'll get numb to it. -So it gets easier? -No. [Hugo] And that's why I live in the middle of nowhere. I find peace in isolation. You got to do what you got to do, right? [Hugo sips] To kill The Untouchables. Yeah. We're in a league of our own. -[dramatic music] -[insects buzzing] [dramatic music continues] I paid a lot of money for you motherfuckers. Don't make me look bad. [gun clicks] [engines rev] [engines idling] Don't send your men in unless I say so. [dramatic music continues] [glass thuds] -First team's in position. -[Nikita] Breach. [walkie-talkie static] Sam, get down!

[Sam grunts and pants] Yeah, I need an extraction at Hugo's house, now! [pilot] Echo sierra. Heading in for Tac Air South. Zero, two, three, four, formation alpha. E.T.A. nineteen minutes. Repeat E.T.A. nineteen minutes. [helicopter whirring] [faint radio chatter] Fuck. [panting] Hang in there buddy. [panting] -[helicopter whirring] -[faint radio chatter] -[helicopter whirring] -[faint radio chatter] [nurse] We got two stab wounds in the abdomen. We gotta stop the blood pressure, pulse is one twenty and threading. I want two large boards with saline... [Liam] Where have you been all week, Sam? How is he? He's in the hospital. He's lost a lot of blood. It's not looking great. [Liam] Tell me you've not been out there looking for Miro on your own. I'm sorry. [Sam] Trying to make up for my mistake. It's not your fault. -You guys were outnumbered. -[pen thuds] They took you by surprise. Hell, you were lucky to get out of there with your life. [Liam] This mission was doomed from the beginning. It's time to come home. Regroup. I called it off. Hugo's gone. And they know about all of our agents in the system, including you. [Sam] But the auction's tomorrow. [Liam] We have no idea where. You'd be going in blind. -But-- -[Liam] It's too dangerous. -We have to-- -[Liam] Our best bet is to use our internal intel network to track and see who's buying Neely. Hopefully, they don't kill him, and we can start over from there. We have to get Miro. Miro was never the target. But, we have to get him. It's not your responsibility. Sam, you did a nice job for your first time out, but I'm gonna be straight with you. You weren't ready. Yeah, yeah. You're, uh... [sighs] You're right. It wasn't what I thought. It's messy and ruthless and completely terrifying. But, um, I know that now. And if you give me this chance, I'll take care of it. They know we're coming. They suspect anything wrong, they'll move Neely, or they'll kill him. Then there goes all that intel right out the window. But they're not going to kill him because they need the money. You don't know that. So what? You're fine with Hugo dying for nothing? Sam, I appreciate that you've learned a great deal on this mission, but it's over. I've already sent a car for you. [Liam] You know we've been tracking you this whole time. No, I'm staying. I'm not asking, Sam. That's an order. You get your ass back to H.Q. I can get to Miro. Son, you're not listening. That is not possible at this time. [Sam] Whatever happened to taking down The Untouchables? -Goodbye, Sam. -[laptop thuds] Jeez, that was brutal. Sometimes necessary. You think he's going to go for it anyway? Well, see. [door clicks] [door slams] [Miro making monkey noises] [cage rattling] God, you fucking stink. When was the last time you took a shower? Christ. [Neely] Took a shower? I've been stuck in a fucking dog cage. He stinks. -Can we get him cleaned up? -[Neely] Please? Of course. [Daisy] Anything specific you want him to wear for the auction? Uh. Well, for the price that's on his head, I think we should put him in something nice. Maybe a tuxedo. -Yes, sir. -And Daisy, wait. -Yeah? -Uh... [chuckles] let's put a whistle around his neck. -I'm on it. -[Miro] How about that? [Neely] Oh, yeah. They're going to eat that shit up. Eat it up. [Miro laughs] I love it. The genius. [claps] Well? Hugo's dead. Good. There was another man. It was probably his controller. He wasn't a much of a fighter. And he ran away. He got away. [footsteps clomping] [Miro] On your watch. By the time he let's The Collective know, and they find a replacement and ship them out. [Miro] We'll be long gone. How many men did you lose? -[Nikita] A lot. -[liquid pouring] [bottle thuds] [Miro] Can you get more? -[Nikita] Of course. -[Miro] Good. I need more. [Nikita] Okay. [Nikita] Do you want me to go after him? No. I don't. I want you here, for the auction. Double the security. And Nikita, if you see anyone acting suspicious, just please, just take them out. Understood. [footsteps clomping] [Miro sips] [insects buzzing] [door clicks] [door slams] [radio stutters] [slaps face] [phone vibrates] [Sam sighs] Gotcha. [pin rattles] [engine revs] -[dramatic music] -[birds cawing] [footsteps clomping] [door clicks] [door slams] [people chattering] Shit. [gun clanks] [engine revs] Well, I see you don't have a date, young man. Would you like to borrow one? -What? -Would you like to borrow one? I'd go with the redhead, but don't let me influence you. [chuckles] I don't need a date. Thank you. Because I was planning on purchasing one myself. [chuckles] This guy. Hey, man. Terence Madsen. What's your name, my friend? -George Lee. -Lee? Well, I think I heard you. Oil, right? [Sam] Among other things. [Daisy] Name? George Lee. [Daisy] George Lee. I got you. [Daisy] Welcome. Name? [Terence] Terence Madsen. But you can call me any time. -[metal detector whines] -Wait. In your ear, what is that? Uh. It's my hearing aid. Hearing aid? Is she giving you a hard time, George? I don't know. Listen, I know him. He's cool. All right, I'm sorry. You can never be too careful. Enjoy your time, Mr. Lee. I will. Thank you. [engine revs] [Terence] Now, where were we? [dramatic music] [footsteps clomping] [people chattering] [people laughing] [people muttering] [patron] Now, that's how you tell a joke. -[classy music] -[footsteps clomping] [chuckles] George, you sitting with us, or what? Yes, of course. Well, let's go then. [classy music continues] So is this your first time at one of these? No, it's not. You? Well, I've been twice. Obviously. -[Sam chuckles] -[Terence] Still haven't seen you around. Who do you know here? I was, uh, I was in business with Barry Vanderstorm. Oh, shit. I'm sorry. You know, I really didn't know him very well. -It's okay. -No, no, no, no. It's fucked up how they got him in the leak. You must be pissed at Neely, huh? Yeah. You thinking of buying him? If the price is right. I should introduce you to Miro. No, that's not nece-- No, no, no, no. Listen. I mean, you were close with Barry, after all. That's not a problem. Come on. [Miro laughing] That's a good one. -You're killing me. -Sir. Yes. What? Yes. Terence Madsen. I have bought some of your finest. Madsen. Madsen, I remember you, Madsen. Good to see you, sir. How are you? How are they? They have never been better. [Miro and Terence laugh] This here is my friend, George Lee. Yes, Mr. George, I'm sorry. Yeah, I was a friend of Barry Vanderstorms. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm terrible with faces, but, um, yeah, it's good to see you. George is thinking of buying the whistleblower. Oh, well, why didn't you say so? Jesus Christ. That's interesting. He won't be cheap. I'll manage. I hope you do. I'll keep an eye out for you Mr., Mr.-- Lee. [Miro] I will not forget that again. Welcome. Welcome. Enjoy yourselves. Everything's on the house, buddy. Well, that went well. Show's about to start, Lee, so. You can head back without me. I'll catch up in a second. Thank you. [dramatic music] [cage clanks] [cage clanks] [chains rattling] [people cheering] [Miro chuckles] [Miro] Hey. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Thank you. Thank you. I'm so happy you all came tonight. I know you came from far and wide. We have some old faces, some new. [Miro] And it's great to see you. We have a wonderful, wonderful evening. It's a very exciting night. Very exciting.

How are you holding up? -[guns firing] -Yeah, I'm, uh... Pinned down. Running low on ammo. How many bullets you have left? [guns firing] Three. There's four of them. You know what you got to do. Pistol puppet? Pistol puppet. [dramatic music continues] [gun fires] [both grunting] -[gun fires] -[bodies thud] No shit. I told your ass. Oh, it's just you. Disappointing. Is that the knife girl?
