[MUSIC PLAYING] Bidding is now open. Too rich for my blood. [LASER SOUNDS] Ooh. I think I've had a little too much to drink. Woo! LANCE: Well, I don't know. Get on with it. Welcome to Blonde Heaven. A blonde on your arm, a song in your heart or your money cheerfully refunded. Brothers and sisters, I humbly request your assistance. No. I am high bidder. [LASER SOUND] Ah. We cannot permit this She claims every prize. Am I not within my right? It's not the prize for the strong. Is it not the law? Brothers and sisters, I humbly request your assistance. Let us join together so that I, your humble servant, need the combined strength of many to do what none of us may do alone. It is the law. It is the law. [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING - "MY HORSE IS A HARLEY"] (SINGING) I was born a hundred years too late. I wasted 30 years trying to compensate. I'll just accept my fate. It ain't fair, but that's the breaks. I'll be a 20th century man, if that's what it takes. Because my horse is a Harley. My gun's a guitar. I'm sorry. It's just you have such an interesting look. Are you a model? I'm an actress. Yes. Take my card. There's someone I think you should meet if you want to get ahead in this town. Is your friend an agent? In a manner of speaking. Call that number and make an appointment after work. You've got such a fresh look. I just know she's going to love you. Excuse me, ma'am. I'm looking for a young lady by the name of Angie, Angie Summers. Angie Summers the actress? - No. Angie Summers the pain in the ass from Peachtree, Oklahoma. Kyle, what are you doing here? Angie. What have you done to your beautiful hair? What's wrong with it? I thought you were perfect just the way you were. Right, and I'd be even more perfect barefoot and t in Peachtree, Oklahoma. I bleached it for a commercial. I didn't even get it. - I'm sorry. Angie, I want you to come home with me. ANGIE: We talked about this on the phone, Kyle. KYLE: I know, but I thought maybe if you saw me then-- I'd melt in your arms and give up on my dreams and go home with you to live in a trailer and make babies? I never said I didn't want you to have a career. No, you just want me to stay in Peachtree. I can't have a career in Peachtree, Oklahoma. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure that out. Is that why you ran out on me? What we had was good, Kyle. We kick up so much dust when we're together. I just can't see anything else in on the horizon. Sometimes I get so full of you, there's just no room for nothing else. That's the way it's supposed to be, Angie. There's no room in my life for nobody but you. My love's gotta be bigger than that, Kyle. Until I sort things out, can't we just be friends? Good to see you, Kyle. Real good. Maybe we can go someplace and talk. I got of room down the street. Guy that owns the place lets me have it real cheap. KYLE: How cheap? For crying out loud, Kyle, he's gotta be 80 years old. Let me find someone to cover for me. We can be friends. You know, platonic? Sure. I mean, the whole world don't revolve around sex. Think I'm gonna change into some fresh duds, too. ANGIE: This way we can concentrate on other things we have in common. If it were just for the physical, we'd have never stayed together as long as we did. Yeah, I think we can be friends. Don't you? KYLE: Yeah. I think platonic sounds nice. Real nice. Like you said, the world doesn't revolve around sex. How do I look? KYLE: You ain't no natural blonde, I'll tell you that. Yeehaw. Some things never change. Foreplay's for sissies. I have to admit. You can slow dance with the best of them. Megan will turn of you one day. Let her try. Locked in this stone is the accumulated life force of a thousand years, Vincent's and mine. No one in the coven could hope to stand against me. Yes, but if Megan ever managed to convince them that survival of the coven were at risk, well, they'd turn the combined strength against you. I am the keeper of the law. There is nothing that would make me break it. There is nothing that would cause me to threaten the survival of the coven. Nothing. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to suggest it. - It bores me. They all bore me. This is not the existence I chose. Vincent I chose. Vincent I loved. I chose to spend eternity with Vincent. On the very night he brought me into the coven, they found him, the vampire hunters. For 400 years since that night I've been alone. Always alone. Well, I think I've found someone who will take your mind off the law for a while. KYLE: That's a pretty dress. Pretty pitiful. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you. I have an appointment. An appointment? Christ, Angie, it's the middle of the night. Kyle, this isn't Peachtree. They don't roll up the sidewalks when it gets dark. From what I've seen today, seems like a damn good idea. And I didn't run out on you. I came to Hollywood to pursue my career. Trying to be a movie star ain't a career. It's-- it's not practical. I gotta go. Angie, I'm sorry. I didn't come here to fight with you. I came here to make you fall in love me again. Kyle, I never fell out of love with you. I just couldn't stay. [MUSIC PLAYING] Angie, I'm so pleased you could make it. It's not that your dress isn't lovely, Angie. I just think we'll get better look at you in something like this. Is this OK? It's the only thing that I have that belonged to my mother. Mm. It's lovely. I'll be outside. Making another music video? Just thought I'd check out the new recruits. It's your lucky day, sweet cheeks. I'm making a preemptive bid. You can't do that. Illyana-- Won't ever know about it. [MUSIC PLAYING] You should've warned me. Such a shock. I'm sorry. I thought you'd be pleased. I am pleased. Very pleased. Thank you. Gee, I don't know. An escort service? It's not what you think. You go with an individual, a gentleman, all of whom are very carefully screened by us. And you have a nice dinner, maybe catch a play. ANGIE: You don't have to-- you know. NATASHA: Angie, there's no sex involved. We don't make any extra money if you actually screw the guy, so why would you want to? Isn't that right, to Illyana? I'm-- I'm sorry. I've just had a major shock. ANGIE: It wasn't bad news, I hope. No. Quite the contrary, actually. NATASHA: You want to be a star, right? Right. You're an ambitious young woman and that's something to be proud of. But you've got to go for it. This is your chance to make connections. And that's what makes the world go round, connections. Now, the people we introduce you to are the creme de la creme-- movie producers, studio executives, high-powered agents, lawyers, and movie stars. Gee, I don't know. Take your time, Angie. Just think about it. There's no hurry. Well, I'm late for another appointment. Angie, it was a lovely meeting you. So you want to be a movie star. Why? I don't know. I guess it's a form of immortality. But you probably think that's pretty silly. No, the concept of immortality seem very seductive. It's more than that. Stars, real stars, they're like a separate breed. They don't play by the rules of ordinary people. I'm sure there's a flip side to that, though, too. It must get lonely at the top. No, not if you have that one special person to connect with. You connected with that special someone? I don't know. Do you have a picture? His name is Kyle. [MUSIC PLAYING] When the lady said au lait, I thought she meant, like, ol√©, there's going to be a shot of tequila in it or something. PLUTO: You must not be from around here. KYLE: Kyle Douglas, Peachtree, Oklahoma. Diesel mechanic. Pluto Amschweller, Hollywood, California. Vampire hunter. My day job is a projectionist at the movie theater next door. A lot of them come in here. Vampires. Mostly blondes. I haven't figured out why. Why they're mostly blonde or why they mostly come in here? Both, I guess. Thanks to modern technology, they can go into the daylight. Sunblock 2,000. And it gives them a reflection in the mirror. But sometimes they're not careful when they apply the sunscreen. - Does she check out? - A-OK. Must be a girl. Angie. She's pretty. I want her to come home with me. She'll come around. Just give her a little space. Whole damn state of Oklahoma ain't enough space for her? She's a blonde now, too. - Oh? It's the yin and yang. Huh? Male-female relationships are governed by the principle of the yin and the yang. You chase her and she pulls away. She chases you and you pull away. So what if we both chase each other? So who's the yin and who's the yang? And what the hell can I do about it? You got a couple hours? I've got the rest of my natural life. Ole. Kyle must have gone out. You see? There's no reason to hurry home after all. I'm not sure if I'm ready for this. Oh, nonsense. I just want you to have dinner with a friend of mine. Just be yourself. And when you get back, I'll give you $300. And if you don't like it, Angie, you can go back to waiting tables. Everything's going to be just fine, I promise. She's a cherry. I want you to give her an easy one. How about that production accountant Van Der Beek? The one that just likes to talk. Oscar Van Der Beek. I'll take care of it. [MUSIC PLAYING] ANGIE: I thought I was just going to dinner. Don't worry. You won't finish tonight on an empty stomach. I don't know if I wanna be here. Good evening, ladies. And welcome to my party. [MUSIC PLAYING] (SINGING) I gotta find some love some way, somehow. We're sharing a music video for our new album next week. And you've get just a profile I've been looking for. Amazing coincidence, the resemblance to Vincent. It's not coincidence. It's fate. Our love was cut short and our destiny unfulfilled. But now she is here to complete what was begun centuries ago. Why would you trust your destiny to a beast like Lance? What did you say? Viva took Angie and one of the new girls over to Lance's party over an hour ago. I'm sorry I thought you sent her. Would you like a drink? Just a [INAUDIBLE]. I don't know if I like this. Oh, come on. You've seen all those music videos on MTV. You know, the ones with the sexy rockers and the hot babes? Sure. Well, this is what happens when they turn the camera off. Anything on camera, I want to be paid extra. Thank you. [TIRES SQUEALING] [MUSIC PLAYING] I don't feel so good. Fast metabolism. You gotta move, girl. Come on, you gotta dance. That's it, Angie. Just let it all hang out. VIVA: She isn't ready yet. LANCE: We'll have some fun with Josephina first. It's only rock 'n' roll. [MUSIC PLAYING] [LASER SOUND] ILLYANA: Hey, I almost forgot. Your first date. And I wouldn't blame you if you never wanted to step foot in Blonde Heaven again. But I hope that you do. Why are you being nice to me? Angie, you have a lot of potential, and not as an escort. The right breaks and the right contacts, you could be a tremendous star someday. And I want to be a part of that. Besides, I like you. You remind me of somebody that's very dear to my heart. ANGIE: How's this for a couple hours of chit chat with a bunch of celebrity hunk rock stars? What did you do for these fellas that was worth $300? I don't know, but it's the easiest money I've ever made in my life. Men don't give this kind of money for making small talk. It's dirty money. It has to be. I didn't feel dirty, not until you made me feel that way. You see these? Phone bills, car insurance, health insurance, credit cards, parking tickets. I'll be living in my car before long, if they don't tow it first. You wouldn't need to worry about any of that if you'd just come home with me. I wouldn't have to worry about a career, either. I'm tired. I want to sleep. What's that? What? Is that a hickey? Don't be ridiculous. Some guy's done gone and put his brand on you. - Kyle, let go of me. - Let me see. Angie, I'm sorry. ANGIE: Get out. - I'm sorry. Get out. I don't know what come over me. I'm sorry. - Pack your things and get out. You're right. That's no hickey on your neck. Some critter's done gone and bit you. Get out. [MUSIC PLAYING] [PHONE RINGING] ANGIE (ON ANSWERING MACHINE): Hi. This is Angie. I'm not home. Please leave a message, and I'll call you right back. Get me out. A vampire's soul haunts his body in much the same way a murder victim's tormented soul haunts a house. Now, you separate a vampire from his rune stone and you break his spirit. I mean, it's like cutting out their heart. Now, there's a woman that could break a few hearts. Amanda Blackwell? The cannibal queen in "Eat the Devil?" Lola in "Love Amongst the Zombies?" A woman with no name in "A Fistful of Entrails." "Bloodsuckers of the Serengeti?" Sorry. [SIGH] You are in for a treat, my friend. You're in for a real treat. ILLYANA: Come with me. I have a surprise for you. And they're all your size. I don't understand. Angie, if you want the powers that be in this town to start recognizing you as star material, you have to start dressing the part. But I couldn't possibly accept all this. Oh, yes, you can. [MUSIC PLAYING] (SINGING) And I could say things that you're dying to hear. I could do that. Make everything all right, act so sincere, I could do that, too. Be anything that you want me to be because I can play the part so easily. There are so many things I could do, if I didn't love you. There are so many things I would do if I didn't love you. There are so many things I could do, like I could be tough when you're weak inside. Yeah, that could be me. Never see me cry. I'm the strong, silent type. That's my specialty. Be anything that you want me to be because I can play the part so easily. There are so many things I could do, if I didn't love you. There are so many things I would do, if I didn't love you. There are so many things I could do like I could be tough when you're weak inside. Have you thought about Mr. Missirian? You know, he is one of the biggest agents in Hollywood. Why not? Nothing ventured, nothing gained. ILLYANA: Good just remember to let Josephina handle all the heavy lifting. You're just there as an observer. So why don't you think of yourself as an anthropologist studying the unique wildlife of Hollywood. [MUSIC PLAYING] Is this how it ends for the great Al Missirian? Big game hunter, great explorer, philanthropist, husband, lover. This is how it ends for the great Al Missirian. I must accept my fate like a man. Time to move in for the kill. That's OK. Go ahead. He's all yours. OK. But if I'm going to do all the work, I want some of your money. [MUSIC PLAYING] KYLE: If a vampire chops on your neck, if there is such thing as a vampire, that's all she wrote, right? Wrong. That's a popular misconception. They don't bite you on the neck? Twice. You wanna run that by me again, chief? Over the centuries and through the process of natural selection, humans have built up a form of immunity to vampires. And the vampire has been forced to adapt. Now, look. In his first attack, the vampire's bite releases an enzyme that neutralizes those elements in the victim's bloodstream that the creature finds repugnant. He then returns to feed before the end of the current lunar cycle. If he waits too long, the blood becomes lethal to the vampire and the victim acquires permanent immunity. I don't know. This vampire stuff sounds awful far-fetched, even for Hollywood. Well, what if I'm right? I mean, what about Angie? Are you willing to take that chance? Something awful strange is going on at this Blonde Heaven place. Blondes. Vampires. Blonde Heaven. I don't even know where it is. Escort service. I have a friend who works for a limousine company. He may know where it is. KYLE: Let's go sneak in in the-- [MUSIC PLAYING] Hand me that screwdriver out of that glove box. They probably got some type of escort book. You see if you can find her picture, and that way we can find out where she's going next. What about you? I'm going to take a look around and see what's going on in this place. I'll go first. Maybe you better go second, too. Just keep a sharp lookout. All right. [MUSIC PLAYING] Natasha? Is that you? You're late. Well, we can't send you out dressed like that, now, can we? Take those off. Personally, I'm not sold on the idea of male escorts. Still, live and learn, I suppose. Oh, that's nice. Everything, everything. We like to dress our people from the ground up. [PHONE RINGING] Yes, he's here. Yes, I will. I'll, um, take care of him. Thank you for calling. And thank you for using Blonde Heaven. Bye. Well, that was the client. And they just canceled. I know where I'd like to hang my hat, among other things. [MUSIC PLAYING] Just so the day hasn't been a total loss, come up here with me. It's, um, private. Oh, I can't. I have a girlfriend. - Oh, do you? - I think. Oh, how nice. - She's [INAUDIBLE]. - Yes? Is she? How very interesting, that. Why don't you just take your hat off and stay a while? I always did like doing it under the stars. Well, personally, I wouldn't have it any other way. Now, I think it would be fair if we give this male escort thing a chance to prove itself. Don't you? We need to talk. We've got to go into their nest and wipe them out. Just cool your jets, chief. Before you go shish kabob-ing folks, I want to make sure Angie's not on the spit. I think we should set Angie up with one of those studio executives tonight. They spend so much time talking about the deal, they never actually do anything with the girl. Illyana, Megan set her up with Carl Bibbs. That bitch. CARL BIBBS: Now, here's the deal. Now, you break into the crypt and I'll come out of the coffin. You scream, I chase, but not too far. And then I rip off your dress and release 3,000 years of pent-up sexual mummified frustration. I don't think I like this. CARL BIBBS: Ah, yes! Death to the defilers of [INAUDIBLE].. But first, you must pay homage to the snake god [INAUDIBLE].. - [SCREAM] Ah, ah, ah. There'll be no notifying your grave-robbing compatriots. Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. The mummy will have his way. [SCREAMING] Kyle, what on Earth? Have you been following me? And a good thing, too. I thought you said foreplay is for sissies. I guess I'm going Hollywood. [MUSIC PLAYING] [SCREAM] Damn, Angie. That dress don't leave much to the imagination. Imagine this, cowboy. No panties. Angie, we gotta talk. [MUSIC PLAYING] [HISSING] ANGIE: You've been acting awfully strange lately, Kyle. Angie, that wasn't me last night. I'll say. I wasn't there, goddamn it. You were playing kissy face with some goddamn pervert vampire trying to look like me. I'm going to live forever. And when you're so old and wrinkled and the only good sex you can get is from a blow dryer, I'm going to be up there on the movie screen still young and beautiful. [MUSIC PLAYING] (SINGING) When you feel funky inside and you have to [INAUDIBLE]. Experience the eternal motion of your funky emotions. She can be your downfall or your salvation. She can be your groovalistic sensation. The bitch with the [INAUDIBLE]. Ain't nothing like the taste of the bitch. With a universal funk she will cure all of their inhibitions. testifying before the cosmic court of her judicial decree to set the funk free. Set the funk free. Ain't nothing like the taste of the bitch. Every motion has an equal and opposite groovalistic emotion. That's the law of funkativity. That's the law of funkativity. Ain't nothing like the taste of the bitch. Hi. I decided to come back here and talk to you. I only have nothing to say to you. Good. Because I didn't come here to talk. [MUSIC PLAYING] [SCREAM] Hello. Die, vampire fiend. Miss Blackwell? I'm your biggest fan. Pluto Amschweller, vampire hunter. The pleasure is mine. PLUTO: But you're just a movie vampire. I should know. I'm the president of your fan club. You're that Pluto Amschweller. PLUTO: Uh-huh. AMANDA BLACKWELL: I had to get an unlisted phone number because of you. And a post office box. And a fistful of restraining orders. Get a life. Just like in "Brothel of Blood." I'm sorry it has to end like this. You turkey. You've already been prepped. Is there a pop-up thermometer in your butt that lets me know when you're done? [GRUNT] [SCREAMS] PLUTO: I got this idea from one of your films, "None But the Depraved." Of course. How could I have forgotten? But I'm surprised you didn't recognize this. Of course. You wore this in "Diary of a Mad Hussy." Oh, it's seared into my memory. "Torture Garden," "Sex and the Single Vampire," "Lust in the Crypt," "Vampire Screen Test," and of course, "Vampire Sluts of Sodom." [GRUNTING] [MUSIC PLAYING] Brothers and sisters-- Sorry, sweet cakes. Megan wants you in one piece. Release her. I said release her. That's for Megan to decide. We've elected a new leader. Meet the newest member of the family and my producer. Relax. Blondee Heaven is getting out of the escort business, and you're going to be a star. Kyle. I love you. Forever and ever. I love you, too, forever and ever. [MUSIC PLAYING]
