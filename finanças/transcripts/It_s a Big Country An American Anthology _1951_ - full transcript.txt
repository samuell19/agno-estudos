- Subtitles - Lu?s Filipe Bernardes It's a big country. America, that is. A mighty big country. And we might as well start in with the biggest city in this big country. New York, NY, a wonderful town. Tall buildings, elevated highways, vessels from every port in the world. New York, NY. Like the song says, the Bronx is up and the Battery's down. Millions of people come in and go out... day after day from the east, west, north, and south... ...they come to this metropolitan Mecca. All kinds of people. People such as these on a transcontinental train. Excuse me, are you saving this seat for that fellow? Excuse me, are you saving this seat for that fellow? No, no. Looks like I'm in luck, huh? I saw that fellow get up and I said to myself, kid, when opportunity knocks on your door, don't leave it standing outside, drag it into the living-room. Right? - Yes. - Yeah... Looks like I'm the early bird alright, aren't I? You like to read? - Yes, yes. - That's a coincidence, me too. But I never seem to get any time for it. Always interruptions, interruptions. Is it that way with you too? Yes. I don't guess I've read a whole book in years. Care for a smoke? No. Takes all kinds to make a world, huh? Do you mind if I do? Excuse me, do you mind if I smoke? - No, no. - Thanks very much. Well, this is living. A comfortable chair on a train, a good companion. Cigarette. This is living. What a day, huh? Some day. Oh, yes, yes indeed. Ah, it's wonderful. What a country. Just a great country! Uh? Yes, sir, this is the greatest country in the world. Sure we've got our problems, but we'll lick them. Me I'm just a guy who loves America. Every part of it. Don't you? - Which America? - I beg your pardon? I asked which America? I don't think we're connecting. I'm afraid I don't know what you're talking about. I'm simply asking you to which United States you were referring. Look, um... let's suppose we're up on a plane, right? - Hm. - Right, now... Canada's that way, and Mexico's that way. Atlantic Ocean, Pacific Ocean. Right here in the middle, this is America. The United States, that's what I'm talking about. Oh, well, that's... that's very clear, very. Well, that's what I mean. Of course, by the time that plane landed, the America that you saw from up there would be a different America. - How's that? - In the same way... America yesterday and America right this instant are not the same. What happened to it? What happened to them? My friend, if everybody in the world... tried to measure everything that changes in America in just one minute, they'd fail completely. - Is that so? - Yes, that's so. You see, there are all kinds of Americas. For instance, there's the political America. The Declaration of Independence, the Constitution. The Congress, the laws, all ever changing. Political parties, the Courts. The relationship of management and labor. Foreign policy. That's the political America. Part of it. Then there's the historical America. The land and what's happened to the land. The people and what's happened to them. The Pilgrims, the minutemen, the Battle of Concord. The pioneers, the opening to the West. The Civil War. I've got a friend whose grandfather was in the Civil War, he told me the greatest... Then there's the America as part of the World Community. The America of WWI and WWII. The America of the United Nations and a dream of world peace. I was in a convention about two months ago in Minneapolis... Then, the American personality. The Americans whose fathers' fathers' fathers were born here. And the Americans who have come here from every country in the world. The Germans, Greeks, Irish, Jewish, Italian, French, Spanish, Swedish, Dutch, Chinese. All the Americans. I've got a friend whose sister is half Indian. Yes, and let's not forget the American Indian. All kinds, all sizes and shapes of Americans and America. And that includes Texas, if you don't mind. Oh, no. The America of the deluxe hotel suite, and... running ice-water, the America with more bathtubs, automobiles, telephones and radios than any other place. America, the conscience, the heart, the will. And so I ask you, which America? What America? Precisely! Which America? Or, if you prefer, what America? Let's just skip it, hm? Oh, it's been a very interesting little talk. Very. - I think I'll go get my lunch. - Oh, certainly. Um, perhaps we can take it up again later. Oh, sure. - Do you mind? - Oh, no, of course not. - Beautiful day, isn't it? - Oh, yes. I love travelling on a train, don't you? Oh, I do indeed. You know, I've made this cross-country trip seven times and I never get tired of it. I enjoy travelling across this wonderful country of ours. The more I see of it, the more I love America. I'm proud to be a part of this America, aren't you? Lady, which America? Yes, many different Americas and many different Americans. For instance, an American like Mrs. Riordan, an elderly Irish lady who lives in Boston. Boston, a city of great American tradition. One of the birthplaces of American Freedom. The city of Paul Revere and famous tea parties. The city of Oliver Wendell Holmes, of Ralph Waldo Emerson. Boston, beautiful, historic and busy. Meet Mrs. Riordan, a lady who keeps her own little world... ... in the big world that has grown around her. - Good morning. - Good morning. Could you tell me, please, who wrote this? I guess several people wrote that. Oh... Well, I'd better be seeing the manager. You mean the managing editor, that's Mr. Callahan. Did you have an appointment? How could I be having an appointment... ...when I never heard the dear man's name until this minute? Well, Mr. Callahan hasn't come in yet. Oh, well, it's a matter of some importance. I'll wait. Callahan's gonna love this. Oh, let her wait there till she gets tired and goes home. - Good morning. - Good morning, Patrick. Good morning, Mr. Callahan. Are you Mr. Callahan? There's something I must tell you. It's very important. I've come all the way from Winston Street. Well, um, um... Come in, ma'am. Right this way, lady. Here, this will do fine. My office is clear down at the other end. There you are. Now then, ma'am. What a mad, busy place it is. Well, we've got a newspaper to get out, you know? A newspaper to get out every day. Yes, ma'am, every day. Today too. Mr. Callahan, I like the Morning Post very much. Thank you, ma'am. I don't know what I'd do without it in the morning. Well, thank you very much. Uh... is that what you came here to tell me? No. No... I came because I thought... - Sit down, Mr. Callahan. - Oh, yes, thank you. I came here because I thought you might do something about what's happened. - And what was that, ma'am. - Well, to be more accurate, - What's not happened. - Well, tell me about it. I'm Mrs. Brian Riordan, of 2427 Winston Street. Oh, I see. I hope I'm not keeping you. Well, as a matter of fact we are a little rushed today. This problem isn't something that can wait? No, I'm afraid not. You see, it's in reference to this. Oh, this is the census report. Yes, the 1950 census. - Says it's finished. - That's right, ma'am. I'm not so sure of that. - I don't understand. - You see, I live alone... ...in a district where I have no neighbors. Most of my friends are dead and... my daughter's married and lives far away, so you see... Well, I'll be glad to do anything I can if you'll just tell me what happened. Well, you see, it says here, there are 151,669,275 people living in the country. - That's right. - I'm afraid it's not. You see, I wasn't counted. Oh... you mean the census taker never came to see you? No. And you can imagine my surprise when I saw this... ...and saw that it was all finished. I suppose they forgot me, do you think? Well, it would, um... seem that... I... I would like to be in the last census. Well,, this won't be the last census, Mrs. Riordan. I'm 74 years old, there won't be another census for ten years. I hoped you could do something about it. It isn't a matter I could take up with Father Reilly. Well, as a matter of fact, ma'am, I'm not sure what I can do about it. You see, the census is all finished. But there must be some provision for a special case like yours. I'll tell you what, I'll just take down your name and address... ...and see what I can do about it. Mrs. Brian Riordan, 2427 Winston Street. It's been a pleasure to deal with you, Mr. Callahan. If ever you're in the neighborhood and like a dish of tea, well, you call on me. Thank you very much. Oh, Jimmy! See Mrs. Riordan to the elevator. It's been a pleasure to deal with you, Mr. Callahan, that's the truth. Very funny. Go out and get a Sunday feature out of this. "Bureaucrats versus People". Or better still, get a big book, fix it up to look like a census book and make believe you're the fellow. Ask her all the questions. Here's the address. Get a gander on the place, find out how she lives, all the details, you know. And look official. Wear a hat. Oh, how do you do, Mrs. Riordan? - How do you do? - I'm from the Census Bureau. - I've come to ask you a few questions. - Oh, come in, young man. Oh, thank you, thank you. Uh, Mr. Callahan of the Post called us and told us there'd been a little mistake. I've, um... I've come down to correct it. - Sit down, young man. - Oh, thank you, thank you. These, uh, these oversights do happen, so I'll just ask you a few questions and send this down to Washington... ...and you'll be in the final report. Now then, um... where were you born? Birthplace? What is your name, young man? Michael Fisher. This isn't very nice of you, Mr. Fisher. You're not a census man. I saw you not two hours ago in a big room at the Post. I think this is a sorry joke to play on an old woman who has done you no harm. You'll excuse me now, please. I liked Mr. Callahan, but he needn't make me feel more useless than I do. I'm not blaming you. I didn't figure it myself. But I felt like a dog. I never kicked an old lady in my life. Alright, alright, you told her you were sorry, didn't you? How do you say to a nice old lady, "Madam, I'm sorry, but nobody knows you're alive."? It's a fine way to run a country. Can't even count the people. Get me the Census Bureau, right downtown. I'll tell those guys a thing or two. They'll count every cluck, every heel, every gangster, every lazy no-good, but they haven't got time for a nice old lady who never did anything... but raise a family and mind her own business. If I had... Hello! I'm sorry, nothing we can do about it. Well, if you don't get on it right away, I'm gonna call your boss. Okay, if that's the way you feel. Too late now. I wish I could help. I'm sorry. He's sorry. Operator. I'm awfully sorry. This guy is awfully sorry. Operator! Sorry. Sorry, sorry, everybody's sorry but nobody'll do anything about it. Operator. Hm-hmm. All alone and nobody in the whole world even remembers she's alive. She's got no family, no friends, no neighbors, no identity. Now even the government forgets about her. She's a citizen, she's a member of the community, she just wants to be counted, what's wrong with that? Well, you count her vote all right! The power of the press! Eddie, get out the last edition. Say, if you want company, I'll buy the second round. Come on, we got something else to do. Mr. Callahan. Mr. Fisher. I, um... I wonder if we could just have a minute, Mrs. Riordan. We, um, we won't take much of your time, Mrs. Riordan. We just wanted to say how sorry we are and... ...and to tell you that we meant no harm or disrespect. Excuse me, gentlemen. Mrs. Riordan, I'm from the Census Bureau. I'd like to come in. I have a few questions that I'd like to have you answer for me if you will. Is this another of your young men, Mr. Callahan? - Oh, no, I... - Callahan? - Are you from the Post? - Yeah. Boy, you sure built a fire under our office. - They called us from Washington. - We take care of our subscribers. - The power of the press. - Sure, sure. - Lets get on with it. - I'm not quite certain, young man. The United States Government. Sit down. Name of the head of the household? Mrs. Brian Patrick Riordan. - Birthplace? - Limerick. Where's that, Massachusetts? I'd rather not surprise you thinking half the county moved to Massachusetts, but the time I'm speaking about was in Ireland. Fine, when did you come to this country? Well, it was Uncle Timothy's 30th birthday. I was a child at the time. There was Uncle Timothy and Aunt Margaret... Yes, yes, yes, what year? Well, I'm telling you the best way I can. You're doing just fine, Mrs. Riordan. Now you tell it in your own way. And don't leave out any of the details. We've got all afternoon, ma'am. Yes, ma'am, we've got all afternoon. Yes, all kinds of Americans. Axe in the air and anchors aweigh. Annapolis cadets in that first moment of triumph... when the diplomas are handed to the graduating class... ...and midshipmen become ensigns. And with diplomas are the girls, and why not? Uniforms look awfully well with girls and girls look awfully good with uniforms. But not all men in the navy are ensigns. They're the sailors who have to learn signalling. Who have to learn the problems of an obstacle course and stretch those muscles. But from these ranks other than Annapolis also come officers. Then there are the other Americans training in the WACs, ready to take their places alongside the rest of the men and women... ...who believe in the heritage and glory of America. Paratroopers representing one of the elite corps in the American military. And here is Brigadier General Benjamin O. Davis... ...greeting some nurses in London. And here's the fighting son of that fighting general. Lieutenant Colonel Benjamin Davis, who commanded the famous 332nd Fighter Group in Europe. Yes, all kinds of Americans who sail the seas and fly the planes. And who know something about baseball. Men like Jackie Robinson of the Dodgers. And remember the wonderful stride of Jesse Owens, arms and legs going like pistons and a heart pounding for his country? And the Brown Bomber, the incredible Joe Lewis. And that rifleman of the ring, Sugar Ray Robinson, the champ of champions. Other Americans too, such as Levy Jackson, captain of the Yale football team in 1949. And here is the glorious-voiced Marian Anderson. A great artist and a wonderful woman. The American Empress of Song. The vivacious and beautiful Lena Horne, who does wonderful things... ...with the jump beats and the offbeats. And the incredible Ethel Waters. A woman who demonstrated that through hardship one may find the heart. The titled gentleman of swing, Duke Ellington. And the gravel-voiced horn-tooting Louis Armstrong. And Andie Anderson, who make Rochester mean more than a city in the State of New York. And the nimble-limbed Berry Brothers, all these Americans... ...who've entertained us and thrilled us. But there are others, like Justice Francis Rivers of the City Court of New York, And Judge Jane Bolin of the New York Court of Domestic Relations. And here is Dr. Benjamin W. Anthony, noted radiologist And the Congressman, Adam Clayton Powell Jr. of New York. And then the Right Reverend Bravid Harris, a bishop of the Episcopal Church. And Irvin Mollison, appointed to the Federal Bench. Pauli Murray, former deputy attorney general of California. And here is Mr. Paul Williams, famous national architect. Designer of over 2,000 homes in Southern California, and one of the architects of the new $8,000,000 hospital project... ... that will house contagious and psychopathic diseases in Los Angeles. And here is your 1946 American Mother of the Year, Mrs. Emma Clement of Louisville, Kentucky, the mother of seven children, all of whom are college graduates. One of them is President of Atlanta University. In 1950 another American won the Nobel Peace Prize. Dr. Ralph Bunche. Here he is at a United Nations dinner. A much honored, much respected, a very great American. "In equal rights and self-determination of people. in respect for Human Rights and fundamental freedoms for all peoples, without distintion as to race, sex, language or religion. In human brotherhood. These are the indispensable fundamentals for a just and peaceful world. And here's the late George Washington Carver, distinguished scientist whose outstanding research... ...turned the peanut into a $60,000,000 industry. And in New York University's American Hall of Fame... ...are the figures of many great Americans of the past. And among them is the imortal Booker. T. Washington. Yes, all kinds of Americans. Residence, U.S.A. And the America too of the farm and farmer. The far fields of green, and yellow, and tan. Of the small town and the small people who are the big people. People such as Zsabo, who puts up paprika and tries to raise his family. A family of lovely girls. Meet Mr. Zsabo, another kind of American. Children, breakfast is already cold like ice. Stop pushing, get off my heals, will you? - That's my slip you're wearing. - It is not! - Everything I put on you say is yours. - Everything you put on is mine. Oh, quit arguing, come on. - Good morning, Kati. - Good morning, Papa. - Sorry I'm late. - Yes, you are late. Wait, wait a minute! Candies makes bumps. A scientific fact. - Oh, Papa. - Papa, Papa! - Stop pushing! - That's my belt you've got on. - It is not. - Good morning. - A "gut" morning! - Very funny. Also very dowdy. It's time this poor thing end, God. Jaj, Mama, Mama! Now... You slept good? Make a smile on the face, darling! Good morning, sweetypuss. Before breakfast she's making eyes already, this sweetypuss. - Good morning, Papa. - Good morning, Rosa, all is well? Wonderful. - It's the first real day of summer. - Yes, first real day of summer. Children, what for do you have to be late? And fresh, with ribbons in the hair and bumps on the face. So Papa has to start the day by being mean. Oh, Papa, you're not mean. Morning! Good morning, Sam, darling. Uh? Candy before breakfast? Such a bad girl. Come. Now, nobody has a good morning for the baby? She's dressed like a pig and you don't say she's dowdy. Eats candy before breakfast and you think it's cute. - Comes in late and you don't say anything. - Really, Papa, you know we all love Sam, but it isn't fair. Fair it is not, but different it is. Because some is luckier than you. Sam is ugly. Would you be happier, Papa, if we were a little homely? Oh, no, no. I am also liking to look at you. But there is no peace for your Papa till you are all married. If you're so anxious for us to get married, why did you turn down five proposals for Rosa this week? - Yes, why? - Why, why, why! Were there proposals from Fodors, or Karpaths, or Attilas? No! From Smiths, Coles, O'Reillys, even. Buzzing like bees around my house, they are. - Who, who, who? - Who, who, who, what, owls, you are? Foreigners they were, Hungarians they weren't. Papa, you're awfully prejudiced. I... what does it mean? You think Hungarians are better than anyone else. What? Me, your papa, I am not better than a Greek? Oops, we're back on the Greek. Better you should dance on the stage with kicking your legs... ...then you should talking to Greeks. - Why? - What's wrong with the Greeks? Why, Papa, you never explained why. Why? For five hundred years, maybe even a thousand, Hungarians are hating Greeks. - Could it be for no reason? - Don't get excited, Papa. All right now, Papa. You should excuse me for yelling. Now listen to me. I will find husbands for all of you. Each in her turn when we are working this summer. Kati babyminding, Lenka and Yolande working in the fashion store, Margit waiting on tables and frying fishing. And Roska in the business college to learn to be a typewriter. You should act like fine Hungarian girls. You should be proud. - Unless we meet a Hungarian. - Unless you... Now, up from your seats! Late you are already, let's go. We're going to be late! Roska, my darling, you are the oldest. How you go, so will the others. When your mama died, women said to me, you can't bring up the girls alone. And I said, Mama and Papa will I be, and I will bring them up. Roska, you must show me I was right. Oh, don't worry, Papa. - Don't worry. - Your mama named you right. A rose she called you. Like a rose you are. Pardon me, I... I see you are walking. - To the Danbury bus. - No, I... I mean... I too go to Danbury. I'm going to Bedford Avenue. I too. To the Business College. - To learn? - No, to hire. A stenographer to help me in my business. I'm going to be a stenographer. I started there last month. - When will you finish? - In five months. Then I'll wait for you. - What kind of a business do you have? - Ice-cream. Sodas. I have the largest marble fountain for may hundreds of miles. If you let me drive you there, I could make for you a hot fudge sundae. The greatest. Thanks, but... I'd be late. Regardless, I could drive you to the business college. I don't see that there'd be any harm in that. What harm could there be? Is something wrong? Excuse me, but I've never seen anyone so pretty. I have four sisters, all pretty. To see you all together must be more than a man can stand. I have a homely sister too. The youngest, only ten. But she's really clever. You have no need to be clever. I think it would be nice. Help me be a better stenographer. What a waste... for you to be a stenographer. Oh, it's only until I'm married. You see, Papa's afraid that if I have nothing to do with myself, I'll... ...fall in love. Do you... fall in love easily. Often? Oh, no, I never have. Hungarian girls aren't supposed to. Not until after they're married. What about you? Have you ever been in love? Never. Never in my life before have I loved anyone. I'll be late. Thank you very much. Well... goodbye. You cannot leave me. I cannot wait five months for you to be finished, you're finished enough now. The rest you can learn on a typewriter in my ice-cream parlor. You mean you want me to come to work for you now? No, I want to work for you, I... I want you to come and marry me now. I think it's too quick. You don't know anything about me. You're a girl, aren't you? You're pretty, and good and modest. Can there be anything else to know? Oh... oh... yes, I... Regardless that I love you, it's possible that you do not love me. Oh, no! That is... It seems to me... this feeling that I have... What else could it be? But just because we're in love doesn't mean that we should behave foolishly. We'll do everything properly. I'll come to your store and help you. And we won't even talk about love again... until I've met your family and they've approved... A small brother only, he will approve. And until you've met Papa and he's approved. And my sisters, including the little one. And the little one isn't going to be easy to win. With banana splits and ice-cream sundaes I will win her. - You know something? - What? I'm glad that you're pretty too. It's twice as beautiful inside. Icarus... X-X-Xeno... Icarus Xenophon. Xenophon, Icarus Xenophon, that's my name. - What kind of a name is that? - Greek. It's a fine Greek name. Greek? Jaj, Mana! Oh, no, no, no, no! - No, no, no, what? - You don't understand. - What don't I understand? - I can't work for you, I can't marry you, I can't even let you drive me home. - Why? - You're a Greek. Well, you're a Hungarian, what of it? - Hungarians hate Greeks. - Hate Greeks? I can't help it, for five hundred years, maybe a thousand, Hungarians have hated Greeks. It's a scientific fact. Especially Papa. Rosa, listen to me, look me in the eye. - Do you hate me? - How can you be so stupid? Well, then all Hungarians don't hate all Greeks. It's impossible that this should be a scientific fact. Right? Well, it sounds good to me, but... How will it sound to Papa? No, it... it... Would I have to call you that? Icarus. Well, would you like Icky better? Never mind, I'll think of something later. Later. Then you won't leave me, Rosa? I would if I could, but... I know I can't. For three hours now I've waited for you, and since an hour more than I can bear. I haven't been able to stand it for two hours. - Rosa, we must get married. - Yes, my darling Greek. Guess this is the latest Rosa's ever stayed out. Don't be foolish. Doesn't she stay out sometimes till one o'clock, midnight, at Aunt Wilma's? Hm... of course she didn't say she was going to Aunt Wilma's. So she's visiting a girlfriend from school. - I was just wondering. - A pessimist you are, Sam. When time come to wonder, Papa will do the wondering. - Hello, everyone. - Hello, Rosa. Oh, I'm sorry I'm late, Papa. - I hope you weren't worried. - Not me, but Sam, she worries. - Where have you been, Roska? - Where have I been? Why, getting myself a position, that's where I've been. - Where is it? - Doing what? - What kind of a job? - Stenographer's job. - How much money? - Thirty dollars a week. - Thirty dollars? - A regular young lady job. And before the business college even finished you. My employer doesn't care. He says I can learn the rest from him. In his shop. Hm, hm, better he should train you himself, yes. Tell me, Roska, shopkeeper, what kind shop has this fine man? - Ice-cream parlor. - Ice-cream?! Not for you! Oh, Papa, if they hang around, I'll be finished. Once he sees there are five Zsabo sisters all wanting free ice-cream Mr. Xenophon will fire me! Mr. Xeno... Xenophon? That's a very strange name, Xenophon. I have heard names of this kind. Xen... What is it, Roska, a Turkish name? Oh, no, Papa, it's a Greek na... Jaj, Mama! My oldest daughter is working by a Greek? All day you were alone with a Greek? Oh, no, Papa, there are other clerks in the store. Hungarians they are, huh? Greeks they are! And his wife? He has a wife, this Greek? Yes, Papa, a very pretty wife. She works in the store, the pretty wife Greek? She'll be there all the time, Papa. That's different. It's not your fault that he is a Greek. After all, you are not his mother. No, Father, I'm not his mother. Oh, thank you, Papa! Where is that Greek? - We're all Greeks. - One Greek I want. Where is that Xylophone? If you mean Xenophon, I am Xenophon. Xenophon, Xylophone, I'm coming to tell you what you are. Untrue to her you are, untrue to your beautiful wife! That's a lie, I'm not untrue to my beautiful wife. That's a lie. That's a lie, that's a lie! ( In Hungarian ) I do not understand you, speak English! Of course you are not understanding me! When ever did a Greek understand a Hungarian? I... Oh... Oh, my. - You're Mr. Zsabo. - Yes, Mr. Zsabo, yes. - And you, you are a male wimp! - No, honest, Mr. Zsabo, I'm a respec... Every night my daughter Roska is coming home late. Every day you are forcing her to kiss you! No, I'm not forcing. You are not? Then it is my Roska's fault, no? - No, no... - You banana split, you... ( In Hungarian ) You... you perfume user you! Never in my life have I used perfume! Oh, all the Greeks are using perfumes! All the Greeks are vipers! Papa! Papa, Icky! - Papa, what are you doing here? - Look at her! I could weap for her! You wasp! There is nothing left for her but to take the veil. Oh, Papa, please don't be angry and watch your veins. I will not watch my veins. Where is the beautiful Mrs. Xenophon? I will tell her everything. The works. Papa, Papa, dear... I am the beautiful Mrs. Xenophon. Jaj, Mama! Icky, I want you to meet my sisters, this is Margit. Hello, Margit. Icky, this is Yolande. I'll teach you Hungarian if you teach me Greek. This is the beginning from the end. Papa, Papa, I want you to meet my brother-in-law, Theodore. Look at his muscles! Papa, you know something? I think I'm going to be pretty too. That's all I need. Oh, Papa, it isn't as bad as you think. You'll get used to him. You might even get to like me. Father-in-law, when my papa was upset, I used to make for him a cup of coffee. Never in my life I will again drink coffee! Never in my life! Oh, Papa! Then there's the America of fighting men and women. New uniforms, new units... ...with old traditions of courage, and American fighting initiative. All kinds of fighting men and women. Soldiers, sailors, marines, Air Force, Coast Guard. Men of different colors and different creeds... ...who have contributed to the heritage of American freedom. Men such as Maxie Klein, the soldier, home after the cold and blood of Korea. - Mrs. Wrenley? - Yes. I'm a buddy of Jack's. Oh, really? Well, come in, come in. Thank you. I'm so glad to meet a friend of Jack's. - Um... come in and sit down. - Thank you. - Of course you know that he... - Yes, I did. I'm awfully sorry, ma'am. - I don't believe you told me your name. - My name is Klein, Maxie Klein. What did you come here to see me about? Well, um... Jack asked me to stop in... Jack wrote me all about his friends and I... ...don't ever recall him mentioning a... Maxie, Mr. Klein. No, I... I see, - Did you know him long? - No, we were stationed in Tokyo together. I've saved all of his letters and... ...he always had something to say about his buddies. - He often wrote about a boy named JoJo... - That's me, Mrs. Wrenley, I'm JoJo. - Why didn't you tell me? - Why, see... Jack's the only one that ever called me that. Yeah, you're right. There, he mentions me here. What a guy. Oh, I'm glad you got that from the Department of the Army. Why are you glad? Why, he was a top G.I., he rates a citation and a Silver Star. Mrs. Wrenley, I... I received a letter that... Well, I thought you'd might like. It was the last one he wrote. Is there... is there something that I... I wonder what I did with my glasses. Would you like me to read it for you? This reached me in the hospital in Hawaii. Sit down. It was mailed from Taejon in August. The last place he wrote me from. Don't know what he was doing in Korea anyway. Oh, we were part of the 24th, ma'am. You see, the whole 24th... I knew that! Well, there's a lot of stuff here about... how sorry he was that I got hurt and... ...how he hoped I was feeling better now. He was always worrying about the other guy. Jack was like that. Well, I guess this is the part you'd be interested in. They really started pouring it to us last night. I guess nobody got more than a couple of minutes' sleep altogether. You know when you lay around like that trying to sleep and being scared, you really start to think. I suppose everybody does. You always get around to thinking what in the blazes you're doing here anyhow. A guy still has to figure it out for himself. You got to figure it out because up front... ...all you're really fighting for is to stay alive. And I think the guys right here have a better chance of knowing the score... ...if they live through it, than the people at home. At home it seemed to be just words, United Nations, freedom, democracy, tolerance. Nobody really got steamed up about it. Here, when you see us all together, the Yanks, Sorth Koreans, Turks, Aussies, Tommies, South Africans, the Swede medics, you know it's not words. Nobody tolerates anybody else, you need them. And if anyone of them weren't there, your own chances of getting a rumpful of lead are that much greater. I don't even know where I get off talking like this in the first place. I guess it's just that... for the first time in my life I got scared into... thinking and wondering what happens to all the people back home... ...who'll never get that scared. Or if they do, will it be too late. Still, I'm sure a few of them do know what these words mean. Mr. Bailey, my school Principal, Chuck Parker, the football coach, And I'll lay odds they mean something to my ma. Well, anyhow, like they say, et pluribus unum. And I won't bother you with that soapbox stuff again, like I promised when I said so long. But seriously, JoJo, if you get stateside before I do, drop in at my folks and tell them hello. They're your kind of people. Always your... your best pal. Jack. I'm awfully sorry, ma'am. That's all right. I appreciate your bringing me this letter. It was good of you. That's all right, Mrs. Wrenley. Well, I'd like to stay, ma'am, but... I've got a lot of things to do and I'm... I'm shoving off for the hospital near Chicago tonight... I just wanted to drop in and say hello. So I got off the train when we got to Jack's town. When you first came in, I... ...thought for a moment that you might be wanting to rent our... That is, Jack's room. It gets so lonesome having a room empty. I think renting it's a good idea. You'll have somebody around here then. If you weren't going home, I... I'd been glad for it to have been you. Thanks. I thank you for coming to see me, Maxie. You know, I'd like to write to your mother. And tell her what a fine boy she has. Oh, that'd be wonderful. Here, let me write it down for you. That's Mrs. Isadore Klein, 4910, Benton Boulevard, in Chicago... Illinois. I'll write her today. Goodbye. America of the wide, wide, open spaces. The mountains, the prairies, the ranges. And that of course brings us to the America of Texas, U.S.A. And, um, speaking of Texas... Wait a minute! Now just a minute, partner. I'm the one to tell about Texas. Fact is, folks in other parts of this big country got a lot of funny ideas about Texas. They say we roll our own cigarettes, wear big hats, high-heel boots, things like that. Well, I'd just kinda like to straighten 'em out. Now, where do folks get the notion that Texas is so big? A man's got to have a little room to stretch. Why, we've left plenty of space for the rest of the little ol' United States. No, sir, there's nothin' stingy about Texas. Another thing, the way people talk, you'd think the landscape... ...was just one darn oil well after another. Of course we got a few little ol' oil wells but, um... folks got to fill their cigarette lighters. oil their harness, slick their hair down, little things like that. But to hear folks talk, you'd think all you had to do to strike oil was to poke your finger in the ground. I met an easterner from Kansas City the other day... ...and he was talkin' about the size of our ranches here in Texas. Said he heard of a fellow whose gate was 100 miles from his front door... and was thinkin' about movin' back further so he wouldn't be annoyed... ...by passin' vehicles and peddlers. Now that's just plum loco. Well, I bet you it's not a foot over 93 miles as the crow flies. And I know what I'm talkin' about. How come folks exaggerate so darn much it just burns me up. Of course we do have a few little cows in our ranches. Folks gotta eat. I saw two myself the other day, or maybe it was three, I don't quite recollect. Now you take all this talk about our high, wide and handsome Texas hospitality. Now that's a lot of hogwash. If a neighbor happens to drop in around eatin' time, you just naturally ask him to sit down and take pot luck, that's all. Of course it won't be nothin' much, probably just a little ol' bowl of chili beans, or some stale corn bread. You know what? A travelin' salesman who'd... been all over tarnation, told me the purtiest girls he ever did see... ...was raised right here in Texas. Now, that man just don't know what he's talkin' about. Down here we pick'em for their cookin', not their lookin'. Don't any of them wear anything but Levy's and plaid shirts. Why, you wouldn't even know they was females unless one of them up and told you. Now, there's another misapprehension I'd like to clear up. Folks say Texans think they're independent of the rest of the country. Now, that's a doggone lie. Why, we declared War on Germany the very same day the United States did. Sent over our own Army too. Of course we do have a little different flag. We use one star instead of forty-eight. Why? Well, anybody with horse sense knows that Texans don't believe in overdoing things. No, sir. A Texan is not one mite different from any other hombre in this big country. He acts the same, he dresses the same, he talks the same. Why, would you believe it? A lady from New York drove through here the other day... ...and she told me she thought my Texas drawl was kinda cute. Now, what did she mean, drawl? Why, I talk exactly the same as other people. Takes a little longer, that's all. Well, I'll be movin' on now, and I'm glad I had a chance to straighten you out. Don't listen to rumors about Texas, 'cause none of them is so. Then there's the religious America, where people of 200 faiths live and pray in harmony. Different kinds of churches where different kinds of people... who believe in different kinds of things... ...go to pray to the one God in whom they all believe. Mosques, churches, temples, synagogues, cathedrals. Religion is part of the heart of American culture. And in that culture lived a young minister, a new minister, freshly ordained, who made his way one day in 1944 to a certain church in Washington D.C. St. Thomas Church, please. Naturally, the schedule of events during the week has been altered because of the war. But I can go all over those with you in detail tomorrow. I'll appreciate that, sir. And the Sunday congregation's been large? Yes, yes, yes, the services have been very well attended. Does the President appear regularly at the services? Hm, usually, when he's in Washington and his duties permit. But during the summer, the President spends some time at Hyde Park and... one week he was ill, and... ...he has been away on some conferences, as you know. But the President is in town this week and very likely... ...he may be at the services on Sunday. No, no, sit still. I don't mind telling you that coming here for the summer... ...to be minister in the President's church is a little overwhelming. Yes, yes, I can understand that. I have an idea for a sermon that might be interesting. So? My thought is to talk about the spiritual manifestations of our society... ..as they are reflected on the War Effort. I had in mind developing this theme... in terms of the responsibility that we all have to maintain our religious integrity... ...during these days of physical duress. I have enough time before Sunday to work out something... ...that I think might be of interest to the congregation. Well, I'll be here to help in any way I can be of service to you. - Thank you very much. - Now I'll show you to the rectory. I do hope it will prove satisfactory to you. Oh, I'm sure it will. And so, in these hectic days, we must all of us reassert the spiritual values... in order to better prepare ourselves for the lasting peace... ...that will come with victory. We must be conscious of the efforts made by our leaders and our soldiers... ...in hastening this day of victory. And we must realize the sacrifices they make each day... ...to win this peace. Well, about ready for another Sunday service? Everything is all ready for you. How did you like the subject of my sermon today? Um... well, I... I don't remember the exact title, My sermon today is entitled... The Philosophical Aspects of Basic Social Fundamentals. Hm. Well, I hardly know how to interpret that "Hm". Then forgive me, but I avoided being more explicit. Well, what do you think explicitly? - Do you really want the answer? - Yes. Well, I don't like it. Well, since I'm asking the questions, you don't think I'm doing very well, do you? I don't think you're doing as well as you could. You've been here five weeks. My impressions of you are that... you're very intelligent, you're very good. But you haven't been doing a good job. Why haven't I? I would appreciate knowing. Well, since you ask, I'll tell you. I don't believe you've been doing a job as a minister for the entire congregation. Each week you've been preaching to just one man. You haven't been talking to your flock. You've been talking to the President, who for reasons we all know hasn't been here since you arrived. I'm sorry to be so blunt, for believe me, Adam, you have within you the qualities for being a wonderful minister. But you can't address your sermons to just the President. You can't deal in subjects that have no real interest to your people. And I have a feeling that... ...your sermons wouldn't have to much interest even for the President. For the President doesn't hold himself quite as high over the heads of his people... ...as you do. I'm sorry to hurt you. But the truth can sometimes be very unpleasant for the one who tells it... ...and for the one who must listen. It's time. I was to preach to you today... ...on the subject: the philosophical aspects of basic social fundamentals. And I am terribly afraid that my sermon was to be as dull as it's title. I have also suddenly been made conscious of the fact... ...that all of my sermons to you since I have been here have been dull. But most important, they have been of no interest to you. And it is my fault. I have been talking not to you, but to one man whom I have placed above all others. And as a minister of a congregation, I have no right to talk just to one man, no matter who he is. I can only ask that you try and understand that this error... ...comes from my inexperience and my youth. Being the minister of a President has made me ambitious rather than humble. I can only ask you that you give me an opportunity in the few weeks... ...I shall remain here to really be your minister. I know I have the call within me. And I know that what I have learned here in the five weeks... ...must have been as painful to you ...as it now is to me. Again I ask for your forgiveness... ...and I trust I now can begin to function as a minister should function. To his entire congregation. Thank you for your patience... and for your courtesies to me. Well, that was a real sermon, Adam. I'm very grateful to you, sir. I only wish you'd told me this a couple of weeks ago. Yes, yes, I should have, but... you seemed so intent on what you were doing, it hardly seemed fair to destroy the illusion. Come in. - Reverend Burch? - Yes, sir? The President came into the church just as you began your sermon. He didn't want to disturb anyone, so he listened to it from the back. I didn't see him. But if I had, believe me, I would have said the same thing. I think the President understands that. He'd like to see you. - He'd like to see me? - Yes, may he? May he. Why, of course! I'll get my vestments off. I'll go right to him. No. The President said he's just one of the flock... ...and he'd like to come right in here to see you. The President of the United States. There's the America of the schools. Primary, kindergarten, grade school, highschools and colleges. And the America of the children who go to these schools. First, second, third generations. And immigrants. American schools such as this one in San Francisco. And of teachers and students such as these. ...divided by eight, Children! What's the answer? No volunteers, please. George Ellison. Do you know, George? I was absent yesterday. Sit down, George. And who else hasn't recited lately? Joseph Esposito. Well? I don't know. - You understand division, Joseph? - Yes, ma'am. Well, suppose you tell us about it. Well, you take the dividend, and go in to it by the divisor. As many times as it goes in to, that's the answer. Well, why can't you do the problem? The numbers are too small. Too small? Come up here, Joseph. Now read it. Two hundred and forty divided by eight. Answer, thirty. Frank Grillo, will you change seats with Joseph? Sure will! I'm afraid you'll have to get glasses, Joseph. - Eye glasses? - Hm-hmm. You stay after school and I'll write a note to your parents. Hi, four-eyes! And he cannot see too well... ...and should have glasses. I suggest you take him soon as possible to the op... - Op... - Optometrist, Papa. I never went to school maybe, huh? Optometrist, sure. He's the man who makes the glasses. Let's eat. - We buy the glasses tomorrow. - We don't buy, Joey don't need. He need, or else the teacher no say. Teachers are wrong, Joey see good as anybody. Sure I do. If teacher say you gotta wear, you wear it. Nobody in my family has ever wear glass. Nobody in your family. Concetta, you don't wear glass, no? - What for, Papa? - Emilia. You wear any glass? No, Papa, I see fine. Like I say, all the girls don't need, why my boy? - But the teacher said... - Teacher, teacher! - Read. - Dear, Mr. and Mrs. Esposito, - That's enough! - Papa, what do you do? You see him read, he don't need any glass. Papa, Miss Coleman wanted you to sign it. I gotta bring it back. I speak to Miss Coleman myself. Enjoy supper! - Miss Coleman! - No. - Miss Coleman! - No. - Miss Coleman! - Yes? Miss Colem... Oh! I am Joey's father. Oh, Mr. Esposito, how do you do? Please, nobody in my family has ever wear glass. All of my kids have got strong eyes. Joey don't need either. I'm afraid he does. Yesterday he couldn't see the blackboard from the middle of the room. Oh, it's nothing. Is no good for a boy wear glass. Is make him different from his friends. The kids call him four-eyes, sissy. Joey feel bad, he little boy, he come home maybe he cry. Only at the beginning, Mr. Esposito. As soon as they get used to it, everything's all right. We have other children with glasses and they get along fine. - I... excuse me. - Please, you don't understand! Nobody in my family has ever wear glasses. Nobody in my wife's family... I realize that, but I don't think you understand. - Joey's a very smart boy. - Si! But his schoolwork is suffering. That often happens when a child is handicapped. If they can't see, we try to get them glasses. If they can't hear, we take care of that too. - Can't hear? - Will you excuse me, I've got to see about the children. I'll write you another note. Good morning, Mr. Esposito. Now he's a deaf! - You hear that? - Sure. Turn around. What for? I didn't do anything. Do what Papa say, he no hit you. Listen. - You hear money? - Sure. - What it was? - A dime. Now this one. A quarter, I guess. That's right. Listen. - That? - I don't know. - It sounded like paper. - Like you say! A paper dollar! Why you tell the teacher you can't hear. - What? - Why you say you can't hear? - I didn't tell her anything. - No lie. I didn't say anything about I couldn't hear. - That teacher's crazy. - Oh, the teacher's crazy. She's a crazy... He's right! The teacher's a crazy. - Papa, I'll be late. - Is alright, Joey. Miss Coleman. Oh, good morning. Good morning. - Good morning, Joey. - Good morning, Miss Coleman. - Turn around, please. - I beg your pardon? Turn around. I no hit you. Listen. What you hear? - Nothing. - Look, it's a paper dollar, you see? Joey hear it last night, Joey hear better than you. - I'm afraid I don't understand. - Joey's ears nothing wrong. Of course there's nothing wrong, he hears perfectly. We were speaking yesterday of his eyes. Please, please, I was speak of the eyes, you speak of the ears. Sorry, you must have misunderstood me. - Did you take him to the optometrist? - No. - I think you should. - Miss Coleman, please. When I come to this country a young man, I work in a high building. Catch rivets. Now I'm a boss. You tell me, how I get to be a boss if I have to wear glass, hm? What's that got to do with it? Joseph may not have to be a riveter. Some very important people wear glasses. That's right. But a man with a glass is not so good as a man without. We just want to find out if Joseph needs them, that's all. If he does, if the optometrist says so, then we'll have to see that he gets them. Please. Even if it means calling in the health authority. That's good. You call them in. - I'll speak to them myself. - You'll speak to them? Is a free speech, no? Is a democracy. Everybody has a right to say what he thinks. - A perfect right. - Then why you don't listen? - I am listening! Mr. Esposito... - Please, please. You very pretty girl. You should get married, have babies... - I don't think that's any of your... - Meantime, if you want to teach, is alright, but you're no doctor. How you know he need glass? How you can tell... Mr. Esposito, please! I sent Joseph to the nurse's office yesterday just to make sure. He can't read the fourth line of the eye chart at 20 feet. Doesn't that prove something? - Twenty feet. - Yes. - Twenty feet. - Yes. That's all I want to know. 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18... that's good enough. Come. Read the letters. S-A-L-E-T-O-D-A-Y. Sale today. Next line. 2-0 % O-F-F 20% off, That's alright. Go ahead. E... N... - It's an F. - No, T, Papa. Entire. - That's right! It's a T, it's correct, like he said. ENTIRE. Eyes are perfect, just like am I. Now no more talk about the glass. What's the matter, Joey? - Nothing. - Why you do like this? Nothing. - I got a headache, Mama. - Headache? Thanks for the candy, Mama. You thank Miss Coleman for coming with us. - Thank you, Miss Coleman. - You're welcome, Joey. You behaved good at the optimist. You were a good boy as always can be. Hey, I can read the sign on our house now. - Kauffman's Liver Pills. - You see lots of nice things now, Joey. Gosh, when you first take them off, you can't see anything. Well, leave them on then, they're very becoming. You look like a professore, banchiere... Excuse me, professor, banker. Mama, Papa won't like them, He's gonna be awful mad. Glass is for the school, it's for the moving picture, it's not for Papa. We don't tell, huh? We no show Papa. We make a secret, you, and me, and Miss Coleman, uh? Hey, fellas, llok at Joey, glasses! - How do you see, Joey? - I see fine. - You look swell. - Hey, what you got there, Joey? Come on, fellas, let's jump off the fence! Come on, Joey! - Can I, Mama, can I? - You don't be late for supper! I won't. He's a fine boy, Mrs. Esposito. He's got a fine teacher too. Thank you so much, you... - How are you, Troy? How's it go? - Fine, Joe, fine. - Ah, Miss Coleman! - How do you do? - Any more notes, today? - No notes, Mr. Esposito. - Is good. What you do with Mama? - She's, um... Miss Coleman... We just happened to meet. I get my bus at the corner. Aha. - I'll be right up, Mama. - Where you go, Papa? - To drugstore, buy a cigar. - No, no cigar tonight. - Huh? - You smoke too much. We go upstairs. Please, don't live my life, I want a cigar, eh? Mille grazie. Arrivederci. Hurry up, you guys! - Come on, Joey, it's your turn. - Come on, Joey! Hurry up, come on! Hi, Joey! No! Joey! What's the matter? Joey! - Joey! - Mama... Joey, it's Mama, take away the hand. He took off his glasses. Why did he take his glasses off? Doctor say you sleep. Now, don't wake up so much, you hear? - Yes, Papa. - That's a good boy. 2806 and 24 one hundreds? That's right. You should stay away from school longer, you do better at home. - You finish? - Just about. Then you stay for supper, uh? I got a nice lasagna. - Oh, no, I don't think I'd better. - Oh, please. Joey like you to stay. - Uh? - All right. - Ever taste lasagna? - No. I make good. Joey say... Is my husband. Hi, Mama. - Good evening. - Good evening. - How is it, Joey? - I'm fine, Papa. Let's see what you did before I got here. Excuse me... excuse me, I go see about the lasagna. That's pretty good, Joey. But there's one mistake. Two times eight is what? You be nice to the teacher, you hear? She stay for supper. I make good lasagna. Everything should be nice. Sure all will be nice, you cook a good. I no worry about cook, I worry about you. - Hm? I got no manners, eh? - Shh! - My Papa he never teach me nothing. - Sometime I don't know. - Sometime the way you act. - Huh? No "huh", no "huh"! And you no say nothing about the glasses neither. You no make Joey ashamed no more, you hear? Is fault is with the eye, not the boy. And I no hear no more talk like you been talking! Enough! Who is the man of the house? - You, Papa, you! - I say what I want, I do what I want. Maybe I take hot soup and throw it right on the teacher, how's that? Papa, Papa! Che cosa ha fatto? Mama she kill me. Miss Coleman, please. Sit here, you be next to Joey. - All right. - Where do you want the bread, Mama? - Over there, Emilia. - I did my composition too, Miss Coleman. Oh, that's fine, Joey. - Mama? - There. - Very nice of you to have me. - Oh, no trouble at all. We have plenty for everybody... Miss Coleman, you like hot soup? Yes, thank you. Hmm... What you do, Joey, your lessons, eh? What's the matter? You never see a man with glasses before? We looking good, eh, Joey? Ah, Mama! Papa! Enjoy supper! Yes, it's a big, wonderful country. Proud of its past, strong in its present, confident in its future. A country determined and strong. Strong because of its people and its resources. America, the land where from each mountainside freedom reigns. America, the beautiful. America, one nation indivisible. America, land of the free and home of the brave. - Subtitles - Lu?s Filipe Bernardes
