(PROJECTOR WHIRRING) MISS CARMEN: Why should we care that you make it? I don't care if y'all don't care if I do make it. It's my journey. It's not nobody else journey. Nobody's gonna watch me walk with these shoes I got on my feet. Only one that can walk with these shoes is me. Simple. MISS CARMEN: You don't want nobody to walk with you? Of course. You can hold my hand. You can look back from a distance. You still won't feel what I feel. You still won't look at it from my point of view. When everybody got an opinion, judging me...

We're still completing your reunification requirement. -So... -So what? (PAPERS RUSTLING) You started this case plan a year ago. Now there's four months left, six if I ask for some more time. (GIA SIGHS) Ms. Jasmine, I'm here for every visit. I've passed every test. I've gone to every class you put me in. Gia, you've been late on several occasions. You've yet to complete a successful home assessment. And you've missed child support payments. Ms. Jasmine, I can't get any more hours with all of the courses y'all are making me take. So how am I supposed to pay for all of that? I'll try to ensure this child remains in the home, at least while you're breastfeeding. But unless you complete the program, I can't guarantee the child will remain in the home. Your children need stability and at the moment, we haven't seen enough. What more do you need to see? Have you finished the housing application? Not yet. Look, we're here to ensure the best interests for your children. All you need are three more signatures... I don't need no fuckin' gold star to tell me I'm a good mom. If the courts require us to intervene, are there any other family members that can look after this child? -Someone we could recommend? -So I got no choice, but to be a single parent. I'm getting punished for that too? Gia, I don't need your disrespect in my office. Now, if you don't mind? (GIA SIGHS) Oh. (EXHALES HEAVILY) I swear his little ass gonna come early. (TRINA CHUCKLES) Okay. How was it? Talk to me. It's draining. You'll get 'em back, G. That's not what my caseworker saying. Don't listen to what your caseworker said. Missy got her kids back after how long? Twenty-four months? Wouldn't you rather that than nothing at all? Sometimes that's just how this shit work. You got to play their game. And do what you got to do. -(CAR STARTING) -I got some tacos. (INDISTINCT CHATTERING) Hey, boo. WOMAN 1: Man, it's like 30 condoms in here. WOMAN 2: Well, well, well. TRINA: You real slick, Missy. Yeah. Thank you, Jesus. Miss Carmen, what you trying to say today? WOMAN 3: I mean, damn, how much fucking you think we about to be doing, Miss Carmen? -(LAUGHTER) -That part. No, maintain family size, remember that. I mean, I can try to help you get your kids back home, but I can't if you keep multiplying the household. WOMAN 4: Oh, okay, because... MISS CARMEN: All right, doll face, let's get going here. (INDISTINCT CHATTERING) MISS CARMEN: How do you think she feels, when you call her "Mom"? Can't tell if she's disappointed or embarrassed by me. She has that blank look on her face. Just ices me. It's as if me being there makes her feel worse about herself. TRINA: At the end of the day, that's my mama. And that's gonna always be my mama. But as you can't choose your parents... You know? So... it is what it is. MISS CARMEN: Do you think speaking to her about how you feel would help? No, I don't. She's busy. Her addiction created an anxiety inside me. And, um... That anxiety has been passed down to my child. And I don't know how to save her from it. I'm scared to lose her to it. Instead of healing, I ignored it. Covered it up. Used substances, so I wouldn't feel. I used so much that when I stopped, I had to learn how to feel again. It's not easy. Gia. What about you? MISS CARMEN: No? Okay. When you're ready. Well, we have someone new here today. Why don't you come up and introduce yourself? Hi, I'm... I'm Alexis. Um, I'm from Fresno, California, originally. And... (GIA SCOFFS) There's nothing like a rambling-ass white bitch to piss me off. TRINA: Gia, I don't get why you act like that. Act like what? You got to start speaking up in class. And pretend, like, you paying attention or these people gonna write you up. And you know that's the only way your court report is gonna change. I'm just trying to help you out. GIA: And you're not. (R&B MUSIC PLAYING ON CAR STEREO) (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) GIA: What are you smiling at? (SUCKS TEETH) Nothing. He's dumb. Nobody? No. Nobody. I don't know why you're being all shy. (SCOFFS) I'm not. -How long? -(CLICKS TONGUE) Uh, probably about 12 inches. I ain't even gonna hold you. (CHUCKLES) For real, though. How long you been talking to him? It's been, like, a couple of months. A couple of months and you ain't told me shit? Yes, a couple of months, two, I don't need you judging me. Whatever. Whoever it is, just make sure they don't leave you hanging like the last one. Damn! This is exactly why I don't tell you nothing, Gia. Because you don't trust nobody. You're right. I don't. Eventually, you're gonna meet a real one and realize not every man is a nigga. Right. I just think right now, you're just too tense. You just need to be gripped up, flipped over, clapped. -(BOTH LAUGH) -And thrashed. Like, relax. -No thanks. -(LAUGHS) I'd rather be single for the rest of my life. At least I know what to expect, then. (TRINA SCOFFS) Now, you and I both know that's some depressing-ass shit. Stop, please. -(LAUGHS) -GIA: I'm serious. It's the last mistake that I wanna make. Look, friend, it's not even a mistake. God was just looking down and wanted to bless your ass. But he need to be blessing you with a new car. -This shit raggedy as hell. -(LAUGHS) (INDISTINCT CHATTERING) TRINA: You ready? -(INDISTINCT CHATTERING) -TRINA: Three... MAN 1: Hey, man, check it out.

Why you actin' like you don't know nobody? -MAN 1: Kick rocks. -You know what? You're always talking a lot of shit for a bunch of little-assed niggas -who ain't getting no pussy. -Uh-uh. With them dusty-assed dicks. (ALL TALKING INDISTINCTLY) -MAN 3: She was talking to you. -MAN 2: She ain't talking to me. She talkin' to y'all. I don't know what you talkin' about.

Come. So in here. Do whatever makes you feel comfortable, okay? Why don't you just ask him? I hate begging. I don't think it's begging. I mean, you work here 15 hours a week. You should be honest.

Because addicts must recognize their triggers if they want to take back control of their lives. I've seen most of you here before. And some of you are new. And I've seen you make the same mistakes. But the truth is you won't be able to graduate from this program unless you start to practice self-control. Talia. Forty-six. -What's your name? -Gia Wilson.

And then, this bitch had the nerve to tell me to take the placenta and digest it as pills. WOMAN 1: The fuck? WOMAN 2: Oh. ALEXIS: Isn't it supposed to be good for your system? That's some white people shit. WOMAN 3: Well, I bet you all our ancestors did it. My nana told me to bury it outside the house. It's like getting rid of an evil twin or some shit. WOMAN 4: Do you hear this shit? TRINA: No. That is disgusting. (BREATH TREMBLING) Have you ever helped anybody with an open adoption? I have. And for some people, it's the best of both worlds. Finding a safe place for your kids and also being able to see them. But obviously, that's not a easy decision. No shit. And it can be difficult for some parents. You know, it's very hard to find parents willing to do them. -Why? -Hm. Um, okay. Nowadays, a lot of people go overseas. Over there, bam, it's guaranteed. They come back over here. Birth mothers, you know, they often back out last minute. But you don't need to make a decision straight away. You can see some of the family, see if you like 'em. (BREATHING DEEPLY) It's not that I don't want this baby, Miss Carmen. I know. I don't think you do. I do. -(SIGHS) -You do not have to tell me that, Gia. I love them. Of course, you do. I don't even know them yet. I love them. I really love them. (SIGHS) Hey. Why don't you meet some of the families, take a look at 'em? (FOLDER CLATTERING) (GIA SNIFFLES, SIGHS) (GIA SNIFFLING) They all white? (CHUCKLES) No, they not all white. Keep going. You know, we could choose a few and then maybe we could meet 'em in person. GIA: I don't know. It's kind of weird. (SIGHS) I'll let you know. -See you later. -MISS CARMEN: Mm-hm. (DOOR OPENS, CLOSES) What's up? I see you warmin' up to Miss C? Gia, listen to me. There's a lot of people expecting us to fail. My whole life, I had shit taken away from me. They tried to take our culture. They tried to take our homes. Tried to take our freedom. And you know they'll try to take our babies, too. Same shit that's happening to us right now happened to your mama, happened to my mama and it happened to they mamas. That's exactly why we can't stop fighting for our kids, G. It's our God-given right to have our kids. And I don't want you to allow anybody to convince you otherwise. I'm going to show you something. "For I know the plans I have for you,' declares the Lord, "plans to prosper you and not to harm you, "plans to give you hope and a future." How do you know? How I know what? How do you know God plans for all of this? 'Cause God gives his toughest battles to his toughest children. (CAR LOCK BEEPS) (GIA SIGHS) (BASEBALL ANNOUNCER SPEAKING ON TV) We used to be a team.

Maybe when you get back, we can go back there, okay? Okay. Where's your sister? In bed. Did you give her the ring? Mm. What color is it? I think it's dark blue or black. I'm not sure. It's okay.

(SIGHS) It won't stop kicking, either. I think I got an athlete in there. (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) -You play ball? -Yeah, but just JV. -What position? -Guard, but sometimes my coach switches me to forward, though. You play? I did. I just kept getting banged up. -(CHUCKLES) -So skinny at your age. I just ended up quitting. You don't mind it? I don't like it much either, but I'm just trying to do whatever to get me to SF State. -That's good. -Yeah. You always wanted to go there? Well, my parents went there, so... I used to want to go there, too. Why didn't you? I had my son. You could still go. Just got different dreams now. MISS CARMEN: So where are y'all from again? MONICA: We live in Novato now. Not far from the high school on Rowland Drive but, uh... I grew up in Emeryville with my grandma. And I lived not far from the North Berkeley BART station. We met in college. Were both dating other people, but soon realized they weren't right for us, didn't we? She didn't leave me much choice. (PAUL AND MONICA CHUCKLE) I got pregnant soon after that. We were young, but (SIGHS) we had our friends, people who took care of her when we couldn't. We always wanted Amber to have a sibling, though. So we waited. Wanted to be in a good position for when we had another. (CLICKS TONGUE) Then, when we were finally ready, I couldn't. (CLICKS TONGUE) I, uh, didn't realize how lucky I was to have Amber at the time that I did. MISS CARMEN: Mm. For the last four years, we've been trying to adopt. -It's a process. -MISS CARMEN: Hm. Always is. Did you want to show her the, uh... Oh, yeah. I don't know if Trey and Shaynah are too old for this, but... Well, we thought it might be nice for the next time you see them. Um... Thank you. I'm sure they'll love it. (MISS CARMEN AND PAUL CHUCKLE) PAUL: It was Amber's idea, really. MISS CARMEN: Mm. I would've loved to have an older sister like Amber. MONICA: So, you live nearby here? MISS CARMEN: No, not really, but... (MONICA AND MISS CARMEN LAUGH) You're kind of out here. MONICA: She's being private on that one. MISS CARMEN: Amber, how's school going? AMBER: It's going good. Yeah. MISS CARMEN: Really? You're just saying that 'cause they're here now? (MONICA AND MISS CARMEN LAUGH) Is she telling the truth? PAUL: She's great, I mean, she's a lot brighter than I was when I was her age. She must get it from her mama. MONICA: I don't know about that. -(SOUND FADES) -(INDISTINCT CHATTERING) MISS CARMEN: So... What'd you think? (SIGHS) I think they're great. Yeah? Amber, she's sweet. (CHUCKLES) So you wanna meet other families, or you... -No? Right. -I don't think so. Because, you know, we don't have to do this if it doesn't feel right. Nah, it's not that. (SIGHS) Maybe we can invite Monica to one of your doctor's appointments? Is that what's supposed to happen next? Yeah, sometimes. You know, we can play this however you want. There's no normal way to do this. When was your last checkup? I'm not sure. Maybe a couple months ago. Yeah. And they did the ultrasound? No, not yet. Don't you wanna hear the heartbeat? I do, I... I do, I just don't have insurance, so... No, no, I'll take care of that. We get you some Presumptive Eligibility. Yeah. We can go to our local clinic, you know. They take care of all my mamas. (CHUCKLES) I know, I know it's not easy. But I promise you, it's a lot better than not going. Gotta make sure this baby has everything it needs to be healthy. You, too. (CLICKS TONGUE) What if I can get you in this week? (INDISTINCT CHATTERING) -(LAUGHTER) -MEL: Are you good, ma? Yo, Mama, those were people around. GIA: What? The ones poking through the windows. CPS? I guess so. GIA: What'd they do? Just kept knocking. No one was home. GIA: Good. I don't need them coming in before my hearing. Can't your sister help or something? If they found out how she make a living, I might never see my kids again. -Want to go? -All right. (MEN CHATTERING) (CAR LOCK BEEPS) (WATER SPLASHING) I never knew this was here. Yeah. We got the beach on one side and the forest on the other. And don't nobody even come. Except people trying to disappear. -(CELL PHONE VIBRATING) -(CALL DISCONNECTS) Why you don't answer? Ain't she your best friend? I'm thinkin' of givin' my baby up for adoption. And Trina, she'll be on some, "You siding with the devil" shit. Why she so obsessed with God? I don't know. Make her believe in herself more. I guess. Like, the way I'm feeling, at least this way, I know where she's going. And I can choose where she's going. I don't have to see my baby in a agency office. If the village ain't right, you can find a new one. I just want my kids to remember me as they grow older. Of course, they will. I'm not so sure. You'll always be their mama. And, you know, y'all got a way of doing that, just being there, even when you're not around. They just say shit like that to make it hurt less. (SIGHS) Well, sometimes, uh, when I'm by myself, I feel a hand on my back. And I think I'm just tripping, you know? And then I realize it's just Mom's, you know, letting me know that everything gonna be all good. Sound like some God shit to me. Nah, just spiritual. -Same shit. -(CHUCKLES) Not at all. It's feelings, you know. Not some man-made law to live by. Does that comfort you? Yeah, somewhere. (GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING) GIA: Hey, I wanna hear the story you wrote. TREY: For school?

(GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING) (WIND BLOWING) (INDISTINCT CHATTERING ECHOES) MAN: Probably, like, you know, five years old when they came in here, raided my mama house and took us. Yeah. I'll never forget that shit. I ain't understand it. From then on, it was just from house to house, group home to group home. (MELANCHOLIC MUSIC PLAYING) You know, not having no stability. Really got to me. I might look tough, but you know... (MAN SNIFFLES) MAN 2: I remember it like it was yesterday. My mom was holding me and this car just pulled up. They had suits on. They just grabbed me out of my mom's arms. Didn't say what's going on. Just, like, snatched me up like I'm being, like, abducted or something. From that day forward, my life ain't been the same. In and out of foster care, different ones, you know, and just wondering what's going on, what's happening. How'd it go from me being with my mom to total strangers? I just feel like... It just basically, like, broke me into pieces, you know, like... And, like, the shit I went through in those foster homes really put me on a bad path. And to this day, that's a path I still can't run from. But even through all that, I never once blamed my mom, you know. (MELANCHOLY MUSIC PLAYING) -(TV PLAYING) -(BABY CRYING) (INDISTINCT CHATTERING ON TV) (BABY CONTINUES CRYING) WOMAN: (ON TV) After the child is born the umbilical cord is snipped and clamped. Over the course of the baby's first five days of life, the cord dries out to a hard texture and shifts to a dark brown or black color. It's extremely important not to interfere with this natural process. Do not touch, cut or pull at the cord... (BABY COOING) ...as it could potentially harm the child.

I didn't know what to do. I gave you options. How could I trust you? You get paid to sell kids. No. I get paid to do my job. Helping young mothers get out of a system that was created to hurt people like us. Do not put this on me. You told me you wanted to do right by this baby. I do. Then what is this? What are you doing? I mean, why didn't you tell me you still had a problem? I could've helped you. Not a problem. It was just the first time since... And it's always the first time. Miss Carmen, I swear.

You may step down. Sure. Thank you. JUDGE: Yes? I don't want my kids going through what I've been through. And what I'm going through right now. They deserve to see me. More than once a week, more than for an hour. Look, I'm committed to my kids. I've shown you that. And although you might not believe that I'm fit to parent them right now, no matter what, I'll always be their mama. So what I'm asking... What I really, really want is for you to consider more frequent, longer and unsupervised visitations with my kids. That's it. (SNIFFLES) Thank you. (MELANCHOLIC MUSIC PLAYING) TALIA: Sometimes I feel like I'm not enough. I... I just can't do enough. I don't know if I'm more angry at my mother for doing what she could with what she had. Or if I'm angrier that I'm doing the same to my children. It's so hard to explain to a child that you don't know better yourself. That you're learning. That each day that goes by, you're just winging it. I want to protect them like they need to be protected, but nobody was there to protect me. (WATER SPLASHING) (MELLOW MUSIC PLAYING)
