[PHONE RINGING] MAN: Netscape, a web browsing software developed by Sun Microsystems. It's the future of the Internet. Exactly the idea I've been waiting for to get you on the books. It's currently valued at 20 a share. Most of my clients are buying blocks of ten to 20,000. I'm not suggesting we jump in that big today. What I am suggesting is that we start small, and you can judge me on percentage gains. Yes, of course. I'll do that right away. Nadia, Mr. Wells on one. I could, Mr. Friedman, but look... Hold on, let me close the door. There are 15 brokers trying to overhear this. Now, look, what did you do with the last information packet I sent you? That stock went from 30 to 65. I suggest we step in and pick up 500 shares in Netscape at 20 a share. Mr. Thalberg, line one. Mr. Kent, would this account be individual, joint or corporate? Corporate. Congratulations. Mr. Kent. Be in touch. [ALL APPLAUDING] - Mikey Markovich, prince of the one-call close. - Thanks, Ricky. You could write a bestseller. Hey, I think I'll do that. Frank Watkins called. Oh, leave that. He's on his way up. - Cousin Alex? - Hey, that's Mr. Pushka to you. Put your clothes on. All right. Let's go, come on. I'll kick it off. I thought this was my pitch. I'll start and then bring you in. Which one do you think is the little spoon? [CHUCKLES] RICKY: It all starts with a shell company. Company X announces that it created a pill that cures the common cold. Stock goes through the roof. Then the FDA says the pill gives you AIDS or ball cancer or some shit. The stock drops to three cents a share. Company X closes its doors, but the stock still exists on paper. It's now a shell company. You follow? No one's buying the stock now because it's tainted. But with a little rebranding, no one will know. No one except for the Feds. [CHUCKLES] We have a plan for that, too. It's not enough to rebrand it. You have to start a new corporation. Simple, classy corp will do. And you find one of these shell companies and you buy their entire floater stock. Twenty to 40 grand should do it. The you file a form eight-K with the SEC, and you have yourself a publicly traded company that you control. It's called a reverse merger. Then you get... Then you get your soldiers out there and start pumping out shares of this new stock. Once the entire float gets snapped up, we stop supporting the issue. It tanks to zero, and we're on to the next. Why not just take the corporation public and avoid all this bullshit? What? Because, you fucking mook, to take it public, it needs a valid business plan. Right? Earnings to report, a product or a service to offer. We're not selling fucking sporting goods here. Let's get to it. Come on. So, what do you think? He is sharp. He is an important asset to my team. You're not on his team? Let's give this to him. I can headline this. Mike's savvy, but he needs direction. PUSHKA: I have something else for you. Michael. Ricky tells me you're doing well. He showed me a lot. How's your grandfather? I haven't seen him in far too long. Only guy I know who gets stronger the older he gets. Give him my regards. I will. Okay, I'll put you through to my secretary. WOMAN: Frank called again. What? [VIDEO GAME BEEPING] [KNOCKING] I've been calling you all day. MIKE: That's why I'm here. Sounded important. I'm pullin' out. Is there a problem? It's been two months and no returns. I understand. Frank, listen. Now's not the best time to clear your account with us. Okay, Mike. Here's the thing. I'm pretty sure you guys are into some shit over there. Maybe some of it legit, but not all of it. I've got mortgage payments, my son's tuition, alimony. I can't risk it anymore. I'm cashing out. All 85,000? All of it. Frank, come on. Just give me one month. - Mike. - Frank. Mike. I'll transfer your money tonight. Thank you. [KEYBOARD CLACKING] Let's go, you muppets. Time to shoot people. I got dinner at 8:00. - Pappy's cooking. - Wayne's closes in an hour. Let's go. Come on. [GUNSHOTS] Hey, how did things go with Frank? Uh, not so good. He's cashing out. Jesus, Mike. You're an evil shot. I love this Beretta. MAN 1: Nice show. MAN 2: Yeah, Mike. You shot him in the dick. The thing is when I went to transfer Frank's funds, - his account was empty. - RICKY: Whoa. Why are you transferring his funds? You should be down there trying to make him invest more. I mean, that's called your job. Are you mad at me 'cause you can't shoot? [CHUCKLES] [SIGHS] Look, I'm not supposed to say anything, but Pushka sees real potential in this new thing. All right? He's gonna bump me up, but I need to know that I've got guys I can rely on. Hey. You've got me. I'll look into Frank's account, must be a glitch. [DISTANT GUNSHOTS] Misha. [SPEAKING RUSSIAN] - Judi! - [BOTH SPEAKING RUSSIAN] STELLA: Come in. I have something for you. - This was Misha's. - JUDI: Aww! [GIGGLING] And these were Misha's. We're having a girl. They're beautiful, Stella. Thank you. - Ugh. - He's in the kitchen. [INDISTINCT CONVERSATION] [HUMMING] [WHISTLING] [SPEAKING RUSSIAN] Misha! [CHUCKLES] PAPPY: Just in time. Oh, great. Slice some bread. Eh? I still speak Russian, Pap. You are a practice for my English. Just "practice," no article. Hmm. Mmm. [CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY] You hear that outside? Cops. How do you know? They use .22s. That sound, I'm fluent. - [CHUCKLES] - Hmm. Oh. Thank you. Misha, come. [TOASTING IN RUSSIAN] - [BOTH SIGH] - Look at him. Like a boy with his mouth open. [CHUCKLES] In this country, people are children till 50. Not you, though, huh? [CHUCKLES] He'll get sicker. PAPPY: You know what? It is more money than we have when we left Ukraine after your parents died. But Misha, we don't need any more of these envelopes. You have a daughter coming. It's for Baba's treatment. CLINTON: [ON TV] It is because we have not grown. It is because of 12 years of trickle-down economics. We've gone from first to 12th in the world in wages. We had four years where we produced no private sector jobs. Most people are working harder for less money than they were making ten years ago. It is because we're in the grip of a failed economy here. This fish has tanked. We sold almost a million of it. - We should be getting a bigger cut. - Mmm. [PHONE RINGING] Profits. WOMAN: Hi, Mike. Ricky wants to see you. [KNOCKING AT DOOR] Mike, come on in. How's Judi? Bigger every day. [SIGHS] You know we're done with this stock. This shit's at zero. The next shell's gonna take some time to find. I can't have you sitting idle. I got a job for you... in LA. What am I doing in LA? Appointment with the Dentist. The Dentist? He's starting a business in LA. Needs help pitching the idea to investors. What kind of business? Uh, a real one. How long will I be there? - A week. Tops. - Shit. You know I got a baby coming in like two weeks, right? Can I pitch it over the phone? Oh, he needs you to train some of his guys. Judi will understand when you come back with a piece of the company. - Can I bring the guys? - You won't need them. Come on, it'll go faster. I'll just bring Boone. You'd have to share your cut with him. Better that than missing the birth. All right. JUDI: Who is this Dentist? MIKE: Not this Dentist. The Dentist. Guy's a legend. Pappy used to tell me about him. Why do they call him that? It's just a nickname. Uh-huh. And he wants you to do what? Same thing I'm doing here. Except it's a real company, and I get a percentage. Be gone a week. Tops. You are aware that this person comes out of me any day now. That's what this is all about. How's that? Things are slowing down at work. Plus, we got Baba's treatment, rent on this place... - I'm still working, remember? - Baby. I'm thinking long-term. I want us to move to the city. I even looked at a school on the Upper West Side. - It's called Ethical Culture. - What's wrong with Lincoln? It's unethical. [SIGHS] This is a step up for me. This is a legitimate business. I turn this down now, it might not come again. I thought this wasn't about you. It's about us. [WHOOSHING] [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] MAN: I don't know how you boys do it, living in Brighton. It's like Moscow in the '30s. That's what I like about it. MAN: Set you up very nice for the weekend. Which hotel? No hotel. Slava's place. We're on a bit of a tight schedule. We need to be back in NY after the weekend. Chill out, man. You're in California now. Hey, look, it's Cedars-Sinai. That's where, uh, Kurt Cobain's daughter was born. That's it. Boone has the right attitude. Yes, sir. Misha. ♪ Woman to woman ♪ Woman to woman ♪ Calling to party - ♪ Calling to... ♪ - [MUSIC STOPS] [CHUCKLES] You made it. - Mike. - Hey. - Slava. - Boone. Hi. Come on. Come in, come in. Yeah. So, gentlemen, make yourself at home. Nice. [CHUCKLES] I want to show you something. 400 years of warfare. So you know how strong a man has to be to use this in battle? Feel the weight, big bear. - Wow. - Huh? [CHUCKLES] Swing it. Go on, swing it. - [GRUNTS] - [LAUGHS] Imagine breaking a head with this. Difficult enough. - What the fuck is that? - Ah. 17th century. Yes. I call this one, "Shoot first. Ask questions later." Bam! - [BOTH LAUGH] - That's a good one. Is that a Beretta? SLAVA: The finest of its kind. Go on, pick it up. MIKE: Mmm. - Nice. - Damn right. Lunch? Bless you, Mama. [IN RUSSIAN] Mmm. So I bring you guys here to begin a special company. A real company. What's the product? Cafe. - What, like Starbucks? - Misha. Are you a person who says it's already in existence, or are you a person who says, "I want to be king"? King, I guess. Shall we discuss the terms? I come to this paradise for the sunshine. Outside, I have lemon tree, avocado tree, pomegranate tree. Come. Go ask her again. She doesn't interrupt when men talk. Okay. So, Mama is deaf. She won't hear the big bear second time either. So, simple job. One, raise capital and teach my guys how to pitch company. I invest seed money, but we're gonna need more. Two, send all paperwork to government. Three, go home with five percent. How it sounds? Sounds like a deal. We're going to make a lot of money. - Hey, you've got to spend it to make it. - Yeah. Hey, but, you know, I'm not like one of your "straight" clients. I, I don't hold my money in the bank or under the floorboards. Okay. So? My man Georgi holds it in a store in West Hollywood. So you and Ruslan go pick up the cash, bring it to the office. We go to work. Let's do it. Ruslan! [SINGING IN RUSSIAN] [MUSIC STOPS] - Can I help you? - Georgi. - Yes? - I'm Mike. Okay, Mike. - I'm a friend of Slava's? - Slava? What's he send you here for? He didn't tell you we were coming? He doesn't tell me nothing. - I tell him. - Maybe there's been some miscommunication. I'm here to pick up his money. Mmm. Who the fuck are you? I'm his business manager. No cause for alarm. See? I'm in investments. What do you call him? He's my driver. Mmm. Your driver is cause for alarm. Listen, I'm just here to pick up Slava's cash. He said you were holding on to it. If you want, you can call him. Why should I call him? Do you think he sent us down here for no reason? - I don't deal in hypotheticals. - And I don't deal in degenerate Georgian cunts. - Hey! Hey, hey, hey! - [GEORGI SPEAKING RUSSIAN] Is there a problem here? - Doesn't concern you. - Hey, this is my favorite poker machine. So I say it does. [GRUNTS] [RUSLAN GROANS] [BOTH GRUNTING] [MAN STRAINING] [MIKE PANTING] No! Fuck! Oh, fuck! Come on! Come on, Boone. Fuck, I'll check in the back. Give me the fucking car keys! [MIKE GRUNTS] Come on! Come on! [STRAINING] Right, right, right. Come on! [GROANS] [PANTING] [SOFTLY] Come on, come on... Fuck it! - [HONKING] - Hold on, Boone. Hang on, Boone. It's fine. Hang the fuck on, man. - Expect to be going home. - You're fine. It's going to be okay. [INDISTINCT] Just stay with me. Stay with me. [GROANING] [HORN HONKING] [TIRES SCREECHING] Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Come on! [GRUNTS] [BUZZER SOUNDS] Misha Yevgeny Markovich, 4917 Mermaid Ave., Brighton Beach. Married, no children. Sales associate of Jalem Investments. Sound like you? So, what were you doing at that pawn shop? I was shopping. This is what I have. Three dead bodies, including the man found in your car. - Mr. Grigory Boone. - I was trying to save him. What about the other two? - I don't know 'em. - Did you shoot them? - No. - So who shot Mr. Boone? I'd like to see my lawyer. That is your right. Before you do, I should tell you that the two victims in the pawnshop, Georgi Lebedev and one Anton Cherapakov, killed with the same gun. That gun was found at the scene. Your prints are all over it. - What? - This looks bad, Mike. Double homicide. Maybe you did it. Maybe you didn't. But I got this nagging suspicion there was someone else there, with you, besides Mr. Boone. Who might that have been? [BUZZER SOUNDS] OFFICER: In here. Ah! Uh, would you excuse us, Detective? [JACOB CLEARS THROAT] - Who are you? - My name's Jacob Strauss. I handle Mr. Pushka's legal affairs. District attorney has briefed me on the details of your arrest. So he told you my prints were on the gun? He did. - It's a lie. - Report is clear. I didn't kill anyone. You're charged with homicide. I'll convince the DA to take it down to manslaughter. Why would he do that? They have no witnesses, no motive. I mean, this is a case of whatever we tell the DA. Whom I know well. Now, with your permission, I'd like to plead this down to manslaughter. You'll be sentenced to a maximum of ten years. With good behavior, you'll be out in six. Mr. Strauss, I didn't do this. Slava sent me to that store. Ruslan killed those men. Are you prepared to testify to that? - [KEYS JANGLE] - [DOOR OPENS] [PRISONERS SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY] Coming out. [BUZZER SOUNDS] [ENGINE STARTS] You look like a man. I'm so proud of you. Practicing your articles, Pap? It's your daughter. [CHUCKLES] Six-year-old. But she speaks English like that. Six years, Misha. It's a drop, uh, in a bucket. [LAUGHS] You made a mistake, but you can still have a life. I didn't make a mistake. What do you mean? I didn't kill anyone. Hi, girls. Lana, this is your father. I thought he was away. I was, sweetheart. But I'm back now. For good. Go to the kitchen, Lana. We'll be right there. Is Uncle Ricky coming? Not tonight, sweetheart. You hungry? Why did she call him that? You know, he's been helping us out. Pushka's been helping us out. I didn't know Ricky was around so much. Hey, she's a kid. What's she gonna call him? Mr. Zhukov? She knows him better than she knows me. Give it time. You should have let her visit me. One day, you two will talk about it. The important thing now is that you're home. [BREATHING HEAVILY] RICKY: I got a job for you... in LA. We're going to make... a lot of money. - [LOADING GUN] - [GUNSHOT] Be good. I'll meet you here after school. MRS. COLE: Morning, Lana. LANA: Hi. MRS. COLE: Nice girl. Are you her father? - MIKE: Yeah. - I'm Mrs. Cole. Nice to meet you. Why haven't we seen you around here? I've been away. Well, if you ever want to attend a parent-teacher conference... might be good for you. Thanks. [MUSIC PLAYING] Has been good to see you out, Mikey. You too. MIKE: What's this? It's from me, Ricky, Kat, all guys in the office. Help you get on your feet. What about Boone's family? LENNY: We took care of him. Take it, Mikey. Buy yourself a fucking haircut. [EXHALES] Hey, listen. I got a favor to ask. Yeah, sure, Mike. You're still at the office, right? Yeah. Why? Can you check on something for me? [MUSIC PLAYING] [APPLAUDING AND WHOOPING] Hey, Mike. - Welcome home. - MIKE: Thanks, Ryan. [ACOUSTIC GUITAR PLAYING] [SPEAKING RUSSIAN] - [MIKE CHUCKLES] - [PASHA SIGHS] I miss you, Mike. MIKE: Me too. MIKE: Hey, Ricky. [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] Hmm. RICKY: [SIGHS] Welcome home, brother. It's good to be back. Join us. Hey, sweetheart. Get these two, whatever they want tonight. All right? Indeed. Looks like you're doing all right? The show must go on, right? - RICKY: Come, sit. - Ah. Be a minute. Bathroom. [PANTING] [GUNSHOTS] - [ENGINE REVVING] - [HONKING] [MIKE INHALES] - [MIKE GRUNTS] - [KAT GASPS] Misha... [SPEAKING RUSSIAN] Sorry, Kat. You all right? I'm all right. Not sure about you, though. Just trying to get on my feet. We'll figure it out. - [MIKE SIGHS] - Hmm? You're a talented guy. We missed you. Hey, put in a word for me with Pushka. Put it yourself... unless you see him. [APPLAUSE] [MIKE INHALES AND SIGHS] Check your mailbox tomorrow night. Thanks, Lenny. What's this all about? I'll tell you soon. [MUSIC PLAYING] PUSHKA: Michael. I'm glad you're home. Come join us. Sit down. PUSHKA: Tell me, what would you like to drink? Tito's. You lost your taste for native product? My cellmate smuggled a lot in. I also did six years... in a place called Kresty. It was the greatest experience of my life. Knowing the limits of our strength... brings us peace. You have suffered. But it's over now. Let it all go. [MUSIC INCREASES IN TEMPO] I wanna speak to you about getting back to work. I can't have you selling stocks because of your record, but I have something else. What's that? Italians are fucking with us in LA. - I heard. - Slava needs guns... wholesale, but they have to come from here in the States. What do I know about arms dealing? You're a resourceful man, and you know how to make a deal. I appreciate that... but I'm on parole. I understand. I thought you might be able to help me find something here. Hmm, maybe a waiter. [PUSHKA CHUCKLES] No. [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] We'll find you something better. Welcome home. No, thanks. I don't like caviar. It's $200 a spoon. Leaves a bad taste in my mouth. JUDI: Is this about Ricky? [MIKE BREATHING HEAVILY] [BOTTLE RATTLING] I know it was him. You don't know that. And you need to let this go. Let it go? How can you say that? I should fucking kill him. Mike... You were not the only one who went through those years. We all did it with you. Lana didn't have her father. I didn't have a husband. It wasn't easy for anyone. But you're home now. And we have got to move on. [MIKE INHALES] I am begging you... to let this go. You have to. Promise me. Say you'll let this go. Okay. Say it. Well, I'll be goddamned. Did I say you could sit? [EXHALES] MIKE: That's a start. I will get you the rest when I can. It's a little late. Ricky never delivered your payment, did he? FRANK: You're one hell of an investigator. When I went to get my money back, Ricky said you stole it and skipped town. He would say that. If you didn't steal it, why're you paying me back? Just trying to make things right. [KNOCK ON DOOR] I'm in. KAT: In for what? I thought you wanted to be a hairdresser. Looks like you could use one. [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] The guns. You have an idea? Texas. You know someone in Texas? MIKE: Remember the Tito's guy I told you about? Well, Kat will tell you what we need and when. [DOG BARKING IN DISTANCE] [SIREN WAILING] [DOORBELL BUZZES] Mikey fucking Markovich. - Randy fucking Rhodes. - Come on. When did you get out? Few weeks back. RANDY: Market close early today? MIKE: Hmm. Re-mark it. Consuela. MIKE: In the rag trade now? Oh, just renting a room. Right? How many? 30 in stock. And this one? Good eye. It's military grade. RANDY: This here is an AR/M4 carbine. Short barrel, front sight, rear sight... - charging handle on the back... - [CLANKING] forward assist, dust cover... magazine release... - and a bolt catch release. - [CLANKING] [LOADING MAGAZINE] How much for everything? Let's see. 250 per Beretta, 1,000 for the AR. So, 17,500. How about 15, I take them all? That works for me. I'm ready for you tomorrow. Do I need a background check? - [CHUCKLES] - [LAUGHS] I'll be a minute. Yeah, meet you outside. Kat... It's Mike. I know. It says on the phone. Oh... yeah. And don't use my name. Sorry. I just wanna let you know... I filled the order. The whole thing? Whole thing, at a discount. I'm impressed, Misha. Where's it going? KAT: To a friend in LA. He's got a warehouse in Long Beach. I need you there in three days. Got it. [GUNSHOT] Nice shooting. I'm getting there. Oh, I'd say you there. I like this one. Keep it, we'll call it a loyalty program. Thanks. Hey, listen... I gotta deliver these to LA. Can you come with me? Drive you there? It will be another five grand for your troubles. Who're you delivering to? You remember Slava? The coffee guy? Shit, Mike. The fuck you get me into? [MIKE CHUCKLES SOFTLY] You Mike? That's me. Who's this? That's Fred. [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] Okay, Mike and Fred. [ENGINE CRANKING, REVVING] RANDY: Well, they seem nice. Much obliged. Drop you at the airport? Mike? I'll get a rental. Gotta see an old friend. Thanks for the ride. Old friend, huh? Great to see you, Randy. I'll be in touch. [CAR DOOR SHUTS] RANDY: Be careful. - [DOOR OPENS] - [BELL JINGLING] Actually, we're open. Is Russell here? Can I help you with something? Best if I speak to the manager. Dad? Go in the back and do your homework, sweetheart. [RUSLAN SIGHS] Why so tense, Russell? Thought you'd be happy to see me. Yeah, I'm fucking delighted. But I'm not in that line of work anymore. So those are just flowers you delivered to Slava? His mother. That old bitch really loved him. So when did you open this place? About six years ago. [SCOFFS] And Slava just let you go? He agreed that if I did the Georgi job, he would. What's so special about that job? I thought it was just a pickup. - Turned ugly. - I remember. - So he let me go. - After the job? Yeah. You just said he agreed to let you go before the job. Did I? Yeah, you did. I did as I was told. [SIGHS] [CLICKS TONGUE] I'm not gonna beg you for my life. Your problem's with Slava. If you're gonna kill me, kill me. Otherwise, I have a volcano to go build with my daughter. I'm gonna go back there now, pretend I never saw you. [CELL PHONE VIBRATING] [TIRES SCREECHING] [MIKE EXHALES] Hello, again, Mike. Hey, Dima. Give me the gun, Mike. Come take a ride with us. I already have a car. [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] All right. All right. Machine Gun Mike. Slava. [SIGHS] How've you been? I've been well, thanks. I heard you go someplace for a little while. Six years. No biggie. Hmm. [CHUCKLES] So, uh, you like the smell of flowers? Just wanted to catch up. - About what? - About your coffee business. How's that going? Thriving? Misha, Misha. [INHALES] I like you. I really do. You just should have let it go. People keep saying that. Well, people are right. [GUNSHOTS] [SLAVA GRUNTS] [GRUNTS, GROANS] Oy vey! Ah, fuck! [SLAVA PANTING] So, about that coffee business. [SIGHS] Fuck you. Forget the coffee. What did Ricky pay you to set me up? [SLAVA GROANS] Georgi wasn't holding any money for you. Ruslan was there to kill him. It wasn't him. And that gun with my prints on it. That was from your collection. Nice touch. [MIKE GRUNTS] [GRUNTS] [SLAVA SHOUTS IN RUSSIAN] Old friends, huh? [PANTING] You following me now? [GASPING, GRUNTING] Fuck! [GRUNTS, SIGHS] I've got some gauze in the truck. [COUNTRY SONG PLAYING] - That ought to hold you for a couple of hours. - [MIKE EXHALES] - Thanks... for everything. - Yeah. Do you want me to take you to the airport? Or you got another friend you gotta see. Shit. - [GRUNTS] - Come on, bud. - [HORN HONKING] - [ENGINE REVVING] MIKE: From six years ago. Frank Watkins calls me, asks me for his money back. I tell Ricky. He sends me to LA to work with Slava. And I get sent on some bullshit pickup that gets Boone killed and lands me in jail. The next week, the same amount that Frank invested is transferred into someone else's account. Ricky was stealing from Frank, not just convincing him to buy shady stock. He was putting your whole operation at risk and I found out about it. Why would Slava get involved? Slava was in debt to Georgi and wanted him gone. The two of them cooked up this scheme and I'm the fall guy. You really made a mess. Slava's dead and my whole LA operation is compromised. He compromised that when he betrayed me. So you say. There's some other explanation? Is Slava not enough for you? Now you want to kill my top earner? What would you do? Michael... If you fuck with my business any more than you already have, it won't end well. Get the fuck out. He's right, you know? Get out. [SIGHS] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] - [YELLING EXCITEDLY] - [MIKE GRUNTS] I'm bleeding! It's okay, sweetie. It's okay. It's... It's you. - It's you, Mike. - You take her. You take her. Can you hold onto her for a second? - Let me look at it. - Don't worry. I got this. - Mike, let me see it. - It's nothing. It's no big... - Let me see it. - It's no big deal. [MIKE SIGHS] What the fuck happened? It's just a cut. Mike, I'm a nurse. That's a fucking knife wound. What did you do? I got mugged. - What were you doing... - Don't worry. What were you doing in LA? I told you, I was running an errand for Pushka. An errand where you got stabbed? [SIGHS] I already said, I got mugged. Why are you lying to me? - Is this about Ricky? - No. I'm gonna take Lana home. Just leave us alone for a while. Ju... Judi... JUDI: Easy. We're gonna head out, okay? - I'm gonna take her home. - Fuck! You're going to lose her, Misha. You keep this up... one day you come home... she will be gone. What am I supposed to do? Get the cognac. Oi, Pap... You sure this is still alcohol? [GLASS CLINKING] You know, I should probably get home. Judi will be waiting up. You hope so. [GUN COCKS] You should lock your doors on a stakeout, Boris. Toss the gun. Give me your phone. - Drive. - Where? You know where. [ENGINE CRANKING] Hey, Rick. Mike. Let's talk. I don't know how we got here. Should have killed me the first time round. We were friends, like we are friends. I didn't want you dead. Just distracted. You're out, Mike. Slava's gone. Things can go back to the way they were. What about Boone? You forget who wanted him there. I'm sorry about your friend, but he's not coming back. What do you want? Mike? Do you wanna come back to the brokerage? We could figure that out. Some money? [SIGHS] One last drink, then. RICKY: It's been six years, you little bitch. [GUN FIRES] NEWSCASTER: [ON TV] WIXA, Channel 16 News. We are here in Brighton Beach, outside popular nightclub Tatiana, where, just this morning, we received news that a body was discovered in the basement with a gunshot wound to the chest. Police have identified the victim as one Richard Zukhov, a 41-year-old resident of the area. Mr. Zhukov, a Wall Street broker and frequent patron of the club, was reported to have ties to the Russian mafia. JUDI: Mike. MIKE: Yeah? What the fuck did you do? Hey, sweetie, let's finish this game up tomorrow. - No. - Now, Lana. It's okay. [DOOR CLOSES] Mind telling me why you're losing your shit in front of our daughter? What happened to Ricky? MIKE: What do you mean? They found him shot dead near the boardwalk. You killed him. You fucking killed him. You need to get out. This is my house. Lana is in danger because of you. Now get the fuck out. I'm not going anywhere. We can talk about this after you've calmed down. Get the fuck out. Whoa, whoa. Jude, what the fuck? You're not gonna shoot me. Get out. Paps. Misha. What the hell are you doing? I've been looking for you. I came to say goodbye. I gotta disappear for a while. The men who betrayed me are dead. The accounts are square. Accounts are never square. Misha. Go, Misha, move. Paps. [GRUNTS] [WHISPERING] Paps. [SIRENS WAILING] Help! Help! [SPEAKING RUSSIAN] No. Help! I will take care of him. I will take care of him. You better go. Go out the back. Go out the back. [SPEAKING RUSSIAN] [SPEAKING RUSSIAN] I'm so sorry, Mike. [SPEAKING RUSSIAN] Come on. Let's go, Michael. Go where? Let's get a drink. You go ahead. You sure? Yeah. Just need some time. Hey, Ryan. Thanks for the soup. What are you still doing here? I didn't know where else to go. I am sorry about Pappy. I know how much you loved him. That why you came? To say sorry? No. Came to tell you we're leaving. Today. Right now. Judi. Pushka's men came to our house last night, Mike, looking for you. They threatened me. They threatened our daughter. I can't trust you to keep us safe. I don't believe anything you say. Pappy's death, all of this, it's on you. Where is Lana? She's at my mother's. Can I see her? No. I won't do that to her. We're going. And I'm not telling you where. And if you care at all about us, you won't try to find us and you won't call. [SNIFFLES] It's over. [DOORBELL RINGS] Who is it? It's Mike. [BUZZER SOUNDS] To your grandfather. Mike, I... He had nothing to do with this. I know, but you could have stopped it. What would you have done? I don't know. You believe me, don't you? I do. Then help me. You need to think this through. You're gonna have a whole army after you. Not if you're with me. [PHONE RINGING] Hello. MAN: Call Ruslan. Tell him to clean up his mess. I want him down tomorrow night. I hear he's retired. Retired. The man sells flowers. Call him now. Tell me when it's done. They'll be at the safe house? Yes. [LINE RINGING] [PHONE RINGING] Hello. Ruslan, do you know who this is? Yes. Cousin needs you in town tomorrow. I am retired. He knows that. Who's the guy? He visited you last week. Mmm-hmm. Send me the address. [DOOR CREAKING] [GUNSHOT] MAN: Don't fucking move. Told me you did six years in Kresty. [IN RUSSIAN] You wish you hadn't done it. Michael... You run as long as you can. But this is the beginning for you. Not the end. [TRAFFIC BUSTLING] So you turned down the MFI deal? Yeah. No good. How so? It's a chop. They want us to sell it for them. You get 20%. Chop's played out. The SEC is onto us. Too much risk. We have other deals. I have something for you. From Odessa. Thanks. The Italians attacked us again last night, this time in Sheepshead. Got two more of our guys. We don't have time to cook up new deals. We need guns. Now. - Talk to Randy. - Already did. He got picked up last week. He's out on bail, which we put up, and he's gonna need Strauss who we'll pay for. So I need you to call MFI and tell them we'll sell their shitty stock at 30%. We had a deal. I run finance. You handle other business. Mmm. Technically, Lenny runs finance, and you're the janitor. Technically. News of cousin's death has gotten around. And? And some of the older guys are not so happy about it. And they can't be too happy with you. Oh, what did I have to do with it? Make that deal. [DIALING] [LINE RINGING] JUDI: Hi, this is Judi and Lana. Leave a message. [BEEPS] Hey, Jude... It's me. Tried you a couple of times. It's over now, Jude. It's all over. We're safe. I'm back at the firm. I'm running it. Just like we talked about. Everything's gonna be great. - Everything is great... - [BEEPS]
