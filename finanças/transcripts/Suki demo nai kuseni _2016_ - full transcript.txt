This is the story of "Saint" Kotoko. You drink so elegantly. Thank you for the champagne. Hey Koto-chan, hey... I was wondering... who is this saint? Ah. The club gave me that name... because I am from Akita Prefecture... that's the image. Because women from Akita are beauties. Your skin is so white and soft. You're mysterious. I'm not. Koto-chan... you are so delicate. You're great. Oh, your hands are so soft. When did you arrive in Tokyo? It's been about 5 years. In 5 years, you've become number one, amazing. It’s great, I'm a big fan of yours. Drink, come on. It's a lot... Come on, drink. Thank you. Miss Kotoko, you are requested. Sorry, they are calling me... I have to leave. Kotoko. Hey. -Hey. You had to drink so much today. Yeah. The guests love to see you drink. Really? Of course. Because you're the Saint. Enough with that. But, still... you're so precious, men are passionate. Is that so? There. Thank you. -No problem. You look tired. Really? Your boyfriend again? What's his name? -Ah. Noboru... but it's over now. Is that so? Yeah, finally. He made a scene. Did he hit you again? No, he did not but... he was crying and begging. How pathetic. Kotoko... you finished work? We could go for ramen? I don't want to get fat. You just broke up, let's celebrate. What is it? You don't like Mr. Tohiko, right? It shows? Well, it showed on your face. It's tough being a hostess. Of course, there are good sides. I don't know how long I'll do it. You're learning a lot. You have it good, Goda. For you it's just a side job. How long will you do this, Kotoko? I badly need this income. It's tough to be a model freelancer. If I was an actress, I could earn enough. Now look... you broke up with Noboru... we should have a party. Good idea. Come drink with my LINE circle. That online circle you're moderating? Well, they're all college nerds... but some are handsome. Tempted? College students? Come on let's have fun. Forget the nasty old dudes. Good idea. Thank you all for coming, cheers. Have a nice evening. Enjoy yourselves. My name is Goda Genki, ​​pleased to meet you. I'm his friend, Sawaishi Kotoko. Pleased to meet you. Hey, she helped me organize. Kotoko is called 'the Saint'. Enough with that. I'm sorry. I spoke too much. Come on, we wanna know. Well, next... Riku. Eh? Stand up. -Stand up. My name is Kawano Riku. That's all? Come on, tell us more. I'm a model. There it is. Great. Did Goda invite him? He called many girls. Great. Ice-tea, please. Ice-tea, sure. A Gin Buck. -Gin Buck. Why do they call you a saint? What? What Goda said about you. There's nothing to it, really. Hmm? What is Goda to you? We're colleagues. Really? Colleagues. Riku, you're drinking? Yes, getting in the mood. Let's dance, come on. Come on, Riku. Sure, I'm coming. Come now. Yeah. Yeah. -Yeah. Guys, next club? I'm in. -Me too. Ok, let's go. Sorry guys. I'm not going. I have to study. Hey, hey... I'm won't either. -Me neither. Hey, come on, girls. Girls, we're here too. OK, let's take everybody's number. Yeah. -Good idea. What's yours Riku? Please, Riku-kun. Let's exchange by bluetooth. I got it. -I got it too. So handsome. I know, right? Too bad I was so drunk. He didn't notice you. He looked at me. -Message from Goda Genki- "Are you back home?" "Almost." "We could meet now." "Come back to the club." "I'm at the station." "I'm holding a seat for you." Kahlua Milk please. A coffee cocktail. -Sure. Sorry about that... They were just a rowdy crowd. Not at all, they were fun. Any boy you like? Let me see.. Riku, right? Yes. I see. I like the cool type. The cool type, huh. Did you get his number? No. Why? I was nervous, I couldn't talk. But with me you can. Well, yeah. I don't know how to take that. How was it with your boyfriends? With most of my boyfriends... I didn't really like them so I could talk. I see. They made me drink, came at me... I didn't say no. It's been like that with most of them. It's been like that? Yeah, basically. You don't know what you arouse in men. What? Nothing. That means... you don't care who it is. It's not that I don't care. What kind of boys do you date? Rather handsome, and... someone who makes me feel at ease. Kotoko. You want the same? -Eh? Drink? Well... I can't miss the last train. What? It is still early. Ok...another one, then. Are you OK? I'm just fine. I'll walk alone. Kotoko. What? I'll walk you home. No need. Easy there. You're so wasted. I'm telling you, I'm fine. No, you're not. I'm really fine. Walk straight. But seriously, I'm fine. No, you're not. -I am fine. Walk straight. -I'm fine. Thank you. You can go now. Really? "Really"? I mean, you'll be OK? I told you, I'm fine. It's still locked. I told you I'm fine. Let me make you some tea. Tea? Yes. I'll make it for you. Where is the tea strainer? Kitchen. Ah, OK. Hey, this is so cute. Did you fall asleep? Did you fall asleep? You're pushy. Sorry. Um... What? Don't say anything to Kawano. Of course. The zipper is stuck. Is it OK? Kotoko. I'm... going to... I am going to... Your skin is so soft. Is it? I can't believe... I'm doing it with you. Hey... Can I come again? But it was a one time thing, you see. Oh, OK. Still, call me anytime. We'll meet at work anyway. Right. Suki Demo Nai Kuseni (You don't even like me) Why did you leave your previous agent? How can I put it... I didn't like their methods. Then, what do you want to do? I can do acting, modeling, anything is fine. Well, 'anything' you say... you can't be choosy. Right. Though, you're maturing well. Anyway. Hello, director, thank you for everything. Yes. Right. Really? Yes. That's what he said, you helped a lot. Thank you very much. Right. OK. I'll do that. Goodbye. What is it? It's just, I know that person. What? You know Riku? How close are you? That’s great. He's a popular model. Is that right? Oh, you don't know him. Not that much. Riku. Oh. Good morning. What are you listening to? Here, listen. -Thanks. There. Nice song. You went to a party the other night. Yeah, Goda insisted. You should just refuse. I can't do that. You're being used. Goda found a job, he must have spare time. Looking for a job is so boring. What are you gonna do about the circle? You're busy modeling, right? If you quit, I will too. Ah, right. -Message from Nakata- Ah, excuse me. "Hey, it's been a while. A girl you know came at the office." "Who is she?" "Sawaishi Kotoko. She looked like she wanted to see you, lol." And she came. She came, it's creepy. And so? I like her. Hey, it's Riku. Welcome. No, no. Hey. Hey. Hey, the last party we had... the one you organized... you introduced a girl that day. Sawaishi Kotoko. Ah, that's right. Is she like, your girlfriend? What? -So, I'm wrong? She's not. I see, I get it. Something happened with her? It seems that she wants to meet me. I thought I'd ask you first. That's all, thanks. See you. Hey, Riku. What? You shouldn't see that girl. I'm saying this for you. Why? I heard she does it with anyone. It might damage your reputation. I wouldn't want that. Yes, right. More peppy. Yes, that's it, good… Wind. Good, yes. Oh, yes, perfect, perfect. This one's good right? Right, right? I don't know. This is... wait a sec. The light. -OK. Take this one. Ok. Pull it. -Friend request from Kawano Riku- "I'm glad you sent a request." "I heard you're working as a model." "Ah, yeah. Just small jobs." "You should've told me." "I'm doing a commercial." (bitter smile) "Really?" "But they're weird. And the cameraman is awful." "Lol, I make some calls for you, if you want." "Really?" "Let's go for a drink some time." Sorry for deciding on the place. It's ok. Welcome. Oh, Riku. -Oh. Hey. -Hey. Hey. -Hey. Go ahead. Are they models too? Oh, yeah. We have the same agent. You live in another world. Let's drink. Overseas? Yeah, a fashion show in Paris, not much really. Ive been working hard for that, though. That's great. What about you? I left my agent 6 months ago... so I'm a freelancer now. Ah, is that so? I'm doing haircut and magazine modeling... but nothing steady yet. Sorry, I'm killing the mood. Not at all. You're working towards a goal. I like girls with character. What kind of men do you like? Well... I like... a man cool at first... but who takes the lead. I see. That's not the question? It is. And, also... I like a man with character. Excuse me a moment. Are you OK? -Yes. You drank quite a bit. Because I was nervous. Let's go. Eh? What about the bill? I took care of it. You shouldn't... I invited you, it's on me. I live here. It looks good on you. Is that OK? -Yes. I'm glad we talked. I like you a lot, Miss Sawaishi. What about you? I like you. Please look at me. What's wrong? Riku... You don't need to be shy. It's not that. I can't have sex. What? Why? Because I like you. Right, precisely... No, I really like you. That's why I can't have sex. Rather, I don't want to. I can't have sex with someone I really like. People who like each other... I know. But after that... it'll just be about sex. Soon, you'll be fed up with me. That's not... Yes, you will. I've never liked someone that much. So... I don't want to have sex... I want to cherish these feelings. What is that? That's not true. But rejecting me... -Sorry, but stop. "Sorry" you say, come on... No. That's not right, I... like you. But... I don't want to have sex... I want us to be friends. I should go now. See you. "Sorry, Riku-kun. I really like you. That's why, sex..." Sex... 'Kawano Riku' "Sure!" 'Ozawasera' "For real? Then it's fine." 'Goda Genki' "Ok~" Kotoko. Are you OK? I'll make some tea. I don't want tea. OK. I want a drink. Ah. OK. What happened? I just left Riku. Eh? Riku? He invited me. We drank at Daikanyama... then went to his place. To his place? Riku said he likes me. Riku is so handsome... I told him I liked him too. One thing led to another... but... I couldn't... have sex. What? Why? Because I like him. What? Stop with the questions. I don't want to explain. Sex ruins relationships. Is that so? Yes. That's why... I told Riku, we couldn't have sex. Then his attitude changed. What should I do? I don't know... I really like Riku. But I can't have sex with him. Well, right... But, Kotoko... what's so special about him? What? What's so great about that dude. Well... I like his face... and I look up to him as a model. But you know, Kotoko... he puts up a nice guy act, with his modeling... but he's just a dog, prowling for sex. In college, the girls are all over him. He never stays with any of them. He's a dog obsessed with sex. What? Really? I'm telling you. To him, you're just another girl. He gave you this necklace, right? That's his usual trick. Forget him... date me instead. What? I like you, Kotoko. I'll treat you well. I'll make sure you're happy... sex will be fun. Goda. Sorry. Why? Don't fall for a guy like him. He's really a dog. Today he invited you... he lured you with his "I like you". He's heartless. He thinks I'm stupid. Goda, that's not... Yes, that's it. -I didn't say that. It's just that... I don't... like you, Goda. You're not my type. You mean, I don't have a chance. Sorry. Then why? Why did you let me have sex with you? What's up with that? People do that when they like each other. Then, let's have sex. What? Just let's do it one last time. Eh? Hmm... Ok, just once. Why do you do that? Isn't it what you want? -No. But you said... -No. It's precisely this attitude that's causing this mess. You don't even like me... why do you accept to have sex? You don't like me, right? No, sorry. I don't like you. Then, let's not have sex. No, that won't do... Just one last time. You don't like me, right? Damn it. It feels good. Do you really feel good? Can I? Can I? I'm... Can I be honest with you? Yes. I've never had sex this good. Sorry, I'm hopeless. To tell the truth... the way we are now... I feel like I could date you. But I've decided to stop doing that. "Don't have sex, if you don't like a guy." "Sorry about yesterday. Now, I know I really like you." Send. "I like you too." He really is a dog. Riku, It feels good. That's the spot, keep going. I'm coming. For real? Riku. -What? It was great. Yeah. Kotoko: "I really like you." Riku: "I like you too." Riku, are you skipping class today? Hmm, yeah, probably. Then I'll stay with you. Ah, the LINE circle is gathering. There's a regular meeting today, apparently. It's said like you MUST come. Hmm? Riku. -Uh? Let's go. Why not? -Come on. It's no fun without you. If you go, I go. So, what will you do? Let's start the meeting. OK. -OK. Let's go. -OK, I'm going. Really? -Great. Let's get going. -OK. This is the tennis circle... so... when playing on the court... we get to know people. Next year too... I hope that, with that in mind... we can make good business contacts. Hey, Riku... Yep. Could you put your phone down? I'm talking for you guys. Oh, OK. So. For the 4th year students, next year... I wish they bear that in mind. Put your phone down. Why? I'm done anyway. What's wrong with you? What do you mean? You have to be cocky? What are you talking about? You know what I'm talking about. It's about Kotoko. You knew I liked her. Why did you make a move on her? What are you talking about? Don't play dumb, she told me everything. No, no. Give me your phone. Stop, stop. -Calm down. Enough, I'm fine. I'm fine. Riku, who's Kotoko? It's fine, let's move on. What's fine? What got into you? Please stop this. You're embarrassing yourself. Bastard... It was supposed to be a regular meeting. And now... it's turning into an intervention. Shut up. You think you're something Mr. Model. You have nothing other than sex in mind. People like you are the scum of the earth. Please stop. You're so pathetic it's unbearable. Let's go. -Eh? Ah, OK. I had sex with her. I had sex with Kotoko. What? W-w-wait a second. What now? You did her? Yeah, twice. It was so good. Her skin is so white. She's so beautiful. I want to touch her again. And do her again. So please... stop seeing her. Please, stop. Stop talking with her. Riku, wait... Wait. Riku, I'm talking to you. I'm sorry. I'll go back. Eh? Koto-chan. You've gotten prettier. Eh? Because of a man? Come on... Let me in on the fun. You are wrong about that. Don't you think it's time... you gave me your phone number? Right? At least show me your phone. Eh? My phone? -Message from Kawano Riku- "What's up with you? I thought you liked me?" What is it? Oh, nothing. "I heard you did it with Goda." "Why are you ignoring me?" "You're the first girl to do this to me." "Answer me." "Bitch." Koto-chan... Come on. I don't know if I'm gonna tell you my number. I don't like talking to people my age. All they talk about is finding a job. So boring. They have no dreams. No goal in life. Riku. Riku, it's ringing. What do you want? It's late. I was at work. I see. So what is all this about? I don't get it. You say you like me... but then you do it with Goda. I don't get you at all. You're no different. Uh? I heard. You have all these girls around you... and I'm just one of them. I was told... and it was heart wrenching... but I like you anyway, I thought. So... what I sent you on LINE is true. I like you. Can we date? No way. By now, you must be aware... that I don't like you. Anyway... I don't do dating. I just want to have sex with you. So, I'll never date you. Where are you now? Huh? Daikanyama. Alright then. What's this. What's wrong? Nothing much. It's just that, on Twitter... lots of people are making fun of me. I see. That bastard. Nothing you can do about it, right? Well... here... We should go. Are you going? Well, yeah. Is it over there? Hm. To a love-hotel? Yeah. May I? I... like you. I'm... Me too. You see... I didn't really get it before. What is it? Why they call you the Saint. Ah. But now... I think... I get it. Eh? It's hard to put in words... but that was... You go over there, right? Ah, yeah. What's wrong? Ah, no... sex was good, I thought. Yes, it was good. So... ending it there would be... Say... can we met again... just for sex? Hm? Riku... We can't. You don't even like me. See ya. Let's just go. Ouch. Get up. -Stop. Another bar. -Come on Genki. Another bar, let's drink more. You have a message. "I want to thank you." "From the Saint" Hey. A message from Kotoko. Ah, what a coincidence. Oh, it's been a while. We're shooting a movie, there. It's taking forever. Is that so? -Hm. You're kind of... Uh? You look different. Ah, I'm not wearing much make-up today. Really? I wonder why... you feel different. Is that so? Yes, you're different. A man? No... -No? Ah... How about this. Right now... a friend is looking for a model for his magazine. A magazine? -It's called FLASH. He says it's a serialization project. The way I see you now, you'd be great for it. Interested? Yes. -Good. Ah, they're done. Sorry. Come talk about it at my office. -OK. Call me. Hey, by the way. About Riku. Isn't he in a tough spot? On Twitter... he was exposed for being a sleazebag. I heard. He fooled around too much. Probably payback from a girl he tricked. Do you know who she is? Well... I don't know. Kotoko. "Beyond the sky far away..." "we'll meet." "Even though you don't love me..." "you call for me." "Even though you don't love me..." "you are my..." "world in the mirror..." "singing in the forest." "The white dress singing in the forest." "Ah, if it's a dream..." "Ah, if it's with you..." "it's fine."
