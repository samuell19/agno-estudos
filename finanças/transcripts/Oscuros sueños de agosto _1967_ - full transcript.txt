You look like a dead. You are.... ...dead. Just like a corpse. You ain't got no solution. - She's late. - Don't worry, your daughter will come. She promised it to the doctor. Come on, drink this up. You'll feel better, quieter. - How is she? - Very worried, it's normal. If you want anything, I'm outside. Hello? Hello? Tell me? Yeah, O.K. - Is that she? Tell her to go up. Is she going up now? My god! She'll be better this way. Well... I'm leaving. Come in, please. This way. - It's that you, Ana? - Yes, Mom. Come, get closer. Sit down. How are you, mom? How do you feel? Forgive me. Forgive me... Let's not talk about that now, mom. Even if it weren't for care, do it for pity. Come, let me see you. Your eyes haven't changed. And the hair... No, don't look at me. I look older than I am. And that noise makes me nervous. That's it. So quiet, ¿isn't it? Ana, the day after tomorrow they're taking me to the sanatorium, have they told you? Yes. Do you know how many time will I be there? I don't know, a few time. Hey, wait, wait... I don't know which clothes should I take to the sanatorium, ...they haven't let me go shopping. Where did I put it? You know, I'd like to be pretty. And that you see me. 'cos you are going to visit me, ain´t so, daughter? Of course. Isabelita, my darling, where have you put it? - I'm sorry, time run out. - Daughter, who is with you? That's me, madam. You have to finish. Yes, yes, I understand. Just a moment, just a minute. Here it is, at last. It's always the same, ...the last place where you look for it. - Do you like it? - Very much. It's gorgeous. I bought it for you in Caracas, see? And it has Ana engraved. Only the date is missing. - Thank you very much, mom. Let me put it on you. I'd like you wear it all the time. Do you like it? After so many years, and they don't leave us alone. What a short visit! - The important is that you get well. That you get well soon. - Phone me every day. Alright. Goodbye, mom. Come on, madam, come on. Daughter, I feel lonely. So lonely. I've always been told my mother was a very beautiful woman, lively. And now... ...if you see her. - Did you remember her fondly? - Very few. Nothing at all. Imagine, I was only four years old. What worries me is that I have to leave now, abandone you. Me too. Are you leaving on the third? Yes, we already have the confirmation from Germany. - Will you phone me tomorrow? - Yes. Try to sleep. Good night. ¡Ana! Is that you? Yes, aunt. Why do you come so late? Have you been with her till now? - No, I was just a moment. - And why didn't you call me? We were worried. - Well... it didn't occured to me. You have some supper in the fridge, should I bring it? No, aunt. How's your mother, Ana? They'll take her to the sanatorium in a few days. There was a nurse. - Sure, now she plays the victim. If your father raised his head... Many times he told me, she'll come back, Mercedes, she´ll finally come back. And now here she is. Poor Arturo. Aunt, I don't care about what she did. She's my mother, do you understand? And very ill. - How long before we get there? - About 12 Kms, more or less. Vall is a place for resting. - ¿Cigarrette? Yeah. Listen, Ana, I don't see very clear what he pretends to do. Well, you know, that man, what's his name? Julio. It's better for you to stay away from everything. Be careful. What do your uncles say? The only one is aunt Mercedes. She's having a bad time. Carlos... Many times I wonder if I'm doing what I should. I'll write you. And if anything worries you, you just tell me. A month runs by quickly. - Where are you gonna be? - Near Hamburgo. There. - How much, mister? - Ten liters. - Do you wanna drink something? - Not now. I will, I'm thirsty. An ice cold beer, please. - Here. - Thanks. Excuse me, would you mind giving me a ride? I would like to but I only go to Valle. Me too. Well, get in. Do you know how's the stretch between the village and the main road? I have no idea. Aren't you from Valle? No. In January I passed through there and it was impossible. Ana, no charges, right? You have to pay in advance... ...and the customs. Everything is a problem. - Thanks. - Goodbye. - Goodbye, very kind of you. - See you. ¡Hey! You've forgotten this. - Thank you. - What a strange fellow, ¿isn't he? - Why, 'cos he hardly talk? Many people do the same, sometimes it's better that way. - Good evening, has it been a good trip? - Yes, thanks. Give me that. Where is the sanatorium? - That way, miss. - Thanks. Here. - Thank you. - You're welcome. What a banishment. I warn you that I'm not going to stay here, confined. You'll see how fine I'll organize everything. Ana... What were you thinking? That you ain't gonna have a shower, weren't you? It's fresh, isn't it? Good evening, miss. Come in, come in. We have just arrived. No, not that one. That one. I want one. Thank you. I'm gonna miss you very much, Sister Camino. Listen, Sister Camino, give me two more for my cousin. - She won't give her, she's well-behaved. - Yes. Mother, pray for my son, he has a lot of responsability... ...and an important position. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. How I feel your departing, Sister Camino of my heart... ...after all these months in which I enjoyed your grace! How I feel your departing, my dear nun... ...you consoled the pains and stired up my faith. Your swaying body of little steps, ...your caressing voice sharing the pain, ...I don't want them to be erased in my tired mind, ...in my life, which sometimes is also a fear. That's why, Caminito, nun of my heart, ...that with a very long kiss I say goodbye to you. Goodbye, Sister Camino. Goodbye. Goodbye, Sister Camino. Goodbye. Look out, they're coming. Swap this one. ¿You're Mrs. Isabel's daughter? We were waiting for you. ¿How was the trip? - Fine. Come in, please. - Hello. - Hello. ¿Who is she? ¿Do you know her? I don't like her at all. Dr. Segura told me he wanted to talk to you when you as soon as you arrive. Sabina, ¿do you know if Cus Cus has gone to the village? I had to comb my hair. - He was waiting for an hour. Sure, but I have to do my calesthenics, my yoga. - He's your uncle, ¿isn't he? - Yes, Julio was my father's cousin. Ok. Refering to the sentimental state of your mother, ...I think your attitude must be not avoiding it, ...neither provoking her. As if her relation wit him were something normal. It is in fact, too many years. - Eighteen years. Don't worry for me, doctor, that was my intention. Then I have nothing else to say. Just that I'm happy you came here to spend this month with us. Thank you. ¿Do you think she feels better? It's soon to say something. But you'll notice the change. Try to cheer her up, to make her recovers the taste of life. I'll do my best. We'll meet again. Anything you need, just tell me. Thank you. - Daughter, I'm just skin and bones. - No, not at all. It fits you very well. You will get tanned. - ¿Me, tanned? Just a little red, like a crab. I peel immediately, it's a disaster. The swimming costume is delightful, you have very good taste. - You look very fine here. - This place doesn't seem a sanatorium. You've to go very well-dressed to the dining room. Everybody is charming. It's funny... ...I'm so fine here that I have a feeling as if I have lived here... ...for the last 20 years, and it has been barely 20 days. - What's the matter? - Shut up. Just a moment. He's back. He's back. - Yes. He's back. What's up? - ¿Is your daughter? - Yes, she's my daughter, Ana. Pleased to meet you. Come on. You'll see him. He's a very glamorous man, as the prissies say in Caracas. He's the son of a diplomatic, suddenly he disappears for two or three days, ...nobody knows where he is. Anyway, as always, he's back. Well, I'm ready. Very good. Shall we go down? There's no hurry, let's make them wait. To whom? Everybody know you've arrived. You are the novelty. Let's them suffer a little bit. Oh, Mario. We've been worried about you. - Thank you very much, madam. - Ana, my daughter. Pleased to meet you. Bye. - I already knew him. - Oh, did you? Yes. I'll tell you later. Do you mind waiting a little? - Shut up, there he comes. Excuse me, smile, please. Thanks. ¡My God! Double crime of passion. Biry! Biry! Please Biry, when Cus Cus returns from the village, tell him to comb my hair. - Aren't you gonna take a bath? - No, Pupy got a sunstroke yesterday. We're so tired. We haven't slept a minute. Don't tell me about tiredness. Look at me for example, ...I have high blood pressure and I don't care. Cheer up! - How's the water today? Very hot, like yesterday. No, instead of all, no. She's an actress, do you know? And she is.... - Good morning, Mario. - Good morning, my darling. Mario, come here. Yesterday you went to bed very late. You had the light on until late. You shouldn't do that. You're gonna damage your sight. - Thank you. - Where've you bought those glasses? - What? - The glasses, where've you bought them? - In Germany, from Altona. Are you gonna lend them to yours truly? Yours truly, it's funny. That's what my father's assistant always said. Hi. You look like Esther Williams. - What are you lookinf for, Ana? - A present from my mom. I must've dropped it while I was swimming. You came out this way. You came out this way. I saw you coming out this way. Mom. I've lost it. - What have you lost?. - The necklace. Oh, no. ¿How? I don't know. I realized it when I was drying. She was wearing it when she entered in the swimming pool. I think it's inside. We'll find it when they drain the swimming pool. May be, if it doesn't run by the drain. What are you waiting for, Marcelo? Dive into water, man. ¡Mario! What has he done? ¡Mario! Mario. Please, get out. He sure found it. It's no good diving into the water. I do know it. Lucky for him that he's a man. Are you alright? - Marcelo, let him your diving goggles. ¡Mario! Get'em. Don't you worry, Mrs. Balbina. I'll pray a double Our Father for turning it up. Our father, our father, ...who art in Heaven, who art in Heaven... Forget it, don't worry. - Mom, why don't we leave it for later? - No, we can do it now. I don't want you to take the trouble. Do you know what have I thought? I'm gonna make a pretty braid. Don't laugh, and listen to my advice: Comb your hair this way in your wedding night. - Mon, I'm gonna blush. - Do you start loving me? - Sure. Despite all the things your aunt says? Aunt Mercedes doesn't say anything. I can't believe that. She never liked me, as she didn't have children... She was always bossing about your father. But she didn't boss about me. Oh, please, leave it out. Why do you want me to shut up? That's useless. We'll be a little squashed but we'll manage. - That suits you fine. - Do you like it? When I get back to Caracas I'll send you one. Mine is too big for you. You're smaller than I. You're mine, blood of my blood, flesh of my flesh. You're part of me. You were inside of me. Then you were born... and I abandoned you. I behaved worse than an animal. Each time I think of it there's pain in my heart. My God, how could I do that? - Let's not start all over again. Let's not talk about that. You know you make feel bad. Yes. You're right. I'm sorry. Do you promise not to talk again about that? You have my word. Mr. Mario! Mr. Mario! Listen, that guy... ...the son of the diplomatic. - Mario. Yes. ¿What's the matter with him? He drinks. We don't know why. What a pity! He's so young. Do you know Carlos send you best wishes in his letters? Send him mines too. I'll introduce you to him when he comes in September. Does he love you? Yes. He thinks I'm gonna be very happy with him. He's like a child. Your father was a very serious person. Look, in his letters he says... ...that every night, before going to bed, he looks at my photo, ...it's on the bedside table. He covers it up in order that I don´t see him getting undressed. That's what I like the most. Besides he loves me very much. Light... Light! Light! Turn on the light. I'm afraid of darkness. I can´t sleep if the light is turned off. I can't sleep. If you weren't here I could have died. That's why I have this sleeping mask. I wake up and I touch it. I lift it and see the light. Have I scared you? Poor child. Forgive me. Now, try to sleep. Pili, don't go there! Bring that here. - ¿This? - No, that. You look silly. Here. Sit down. Pili. I'm not playing any more with you. Two against one isn't fair. Pili, do you know this girl? - No. - Do you know what's she doing here? - She's my friend. I'm playing with Pili. No, not you. Cover him. Cover him. Well, that's enough. Now I also wanna play. You've broken it. ¡Pili! ¡Pili!. Hell of a child. Where have you been? I've been looking for you... Come on, come with me. Don't bother any more. She's not a nuisance, she's a very nice child. Grandpa, no. I don't wanna go. If you don't come now tomorrow I won't let you go. So it's up to you. See you tomorrow. No, not yet. That's alright. May I leave now? We've arrived, Mrs. Martina. It's a fairy tale. The princess is sad, what happens to the princess? That's the mountain of the dead woman, where planes crash. - It isn't that mountain. - You have no faith. - Look, follow my finger, that's the face. - ¿Face up? Sure, who bury dead people upside down? Easy, honey. Those are the hands, crossed on the belly. The belly. You sure know how to talk. You're a little dimwit. It was ordered by Isabel de Farnesio, Felipe V's widow, ...she thought that the king, Felipe VI won't be allowed to live there... Long live the king! Dallas, where poor Kennedy was killed! You're always talking about dead people. I don't do it on purpose, I'm so happy. It looks like the Palace of Turin. The steps are of granite, and the banister of limestone. It looks like my nephew Pedro, take a look at his photo. The same double chin. - ¿Who is he? - I don't know and I don't care. Words, words, words. - Hold my hand, Mrs. Balbina. This is Lista, the Queen's favourite dog. It's a pretty dog, isn't it? Doesn't it looks like Pupy? - Hey, are you comparing? - No, just for the eyes. Why didn't Silvia want to come? - You know, actresses have their days. - Like everybody else. This is king Alfonso XII's office... Have you seen her? Ana, how pretty it is! Pool, upholstery, table and furniture from Isabel period... I go to the car for the guidebook, mom. With you I get distracted. I'll be back soon. - I got you! - Little girl. Come on. Hurry up! Mario, please, come with me. Be good. I'm gonna introduce Miss Cooper to you, she's from an university of somewhere. Miss Cooper, Mario. Our private translator. His mother was an english woman. An english woman! So many time that I didn't spend a day like this. Are you happy? - Yes, mom. - Really happy? - Sure I am. Río Frío, Río Frío, Snow White's palace, ...loneliness for crying your Alfonso, Queen Mercedes. I will always carry you in my heart... ...as a rose and a thorn, Río Frío, Río Frío. What a lovely day! What a joy! I feel so happy. Everything is unforgettable, what a lovely day. - Goodbye, Ana. - See you tomorrow. Bye bye, see you tomorrow. Who's given you that news? - It was the Tam Tam. - What nonsense is that? It says that Sister Camino threw herself into the convent well. - And she's dead. - Jesus Christ! What an atrocity! You're like children. Even worse. Would you like we phone Pamplona? So you'll be convinced Sister Camino is alive. That she is alright. Should we do that? Yeah, ok. Please, persevere. Pupy. Pupy, my love. What have they done to you, dear? Take away that mutt! And don't bother! Don't listen to him, my love. It's no worth telling him anything. Take a little of soup. Where are you, darling? What have the done to you, sweet heart? What's the matter? Come on, what's the matter? Who is creaming? I woke up and... Pupy wasn't in his cot, near me. Hurry up. Come with me. It was him. It was him! It was him! What's happened? She has lost Pupy. Hey, don't hurt her. It was him! Leave me alone. What's happened? What an annoyance, Carlitos, Pupy is lost. - Is Mario in his room? - Let's go and see. ¡Mario! ¡Mario! Get out. Get out of here. Come on. There she comes. Ana, Mario has run away again. But before that he killed Pupy. - An unnecessay cruelty. - Why has he done it? - He is so handsome. - Poor boy. I'm gonna see my mother. You tell me later. Sorry. Julio has came. It's gonna be awful for me. Good morning. The doctor asks for you. - You look very pretty. - I suffer but I don't show it. Yo don't have to worry, you're in good hands. - Well, it's a good day? - There are worse ones. How are you, Isabel? Fine. - And you? - My daughter, Ana. Are you ready? Can I stay, doctor? I would like to. ¡No! I prefer you don't stay, dear. I'd feel inhibited. Goodbye. I have never heard of psychodrama, I have heard of psychoanalysis. It's almost the same. The doctor uses the psychodrama in diagnosis and in the treatment. It's the same as in the theater. The patients are the actors and the play is each one's problems. You see. - Will they take long? - You never know. You can wait in the garden, right? I hide the note under the pillow when he came in. It seemed to me she moved so I asked her if she was asleep. Ask her yourself, please. Isabel, are you awake? Julio, Arturo has died. - How have you known it? - A letter from Madrid. But there was nothing written on it, just the note. It was dated two years ago. - It must have been a bastard. - ¿Why? - You have no need to know it. You already knew it? Why didn't you tell me? I don't want you remember things, don't want you to be sad. Besides, if he's dead, we don't care, do we? We don't care. Well, I suppose you don't care after such a long time. Go on, please. What did you say? Nothing, I kept quiet. I just wanted to cry. Why? He knew Arturo had died two years ago. He knew it, he knew it, he admitted it. But, why didn't he ask me to be his wife in that moment? And you? Why didn't you ask him? Me? Should I have asked him? I don't understand you, Doc. It's him. The man should be the one who make the first move. Easy, keep calm. Go on. What happened later? We were much time without saying a word. I closed my eyes. I couldn't sleep, neither did he. At last, I said: Julio, do you think the death of Arturo changes our state? Of course not, Isabel. We still love each other. As always, don't we? Me sentí herida, humillada. I felt hurt, humiliated. I felt like crying, but I didn't want him to see me cry. Then someone came to my mind. - Who came to your mind? ¿Arturo? - No. - ¿Your daughter? - No. I was thinking of my father. Just my father. How sorry he would be if he saw me this way. I had a boyfriend during the war, his name was Guino, he was italian. We used to walk by the river. Later, at night, daddy came into my room, ...he sat in my bed and tell me: Tell me, Isabelita. And I told him everything... I told him how happy I was. He smiled and always gave me a kiss before going to sleep. He tucked me in. I remembered him. I remembered daddy. And how sad we would be if he saw me so sad. So humiliated, so lonely. Then I felt Julio trying to hug me. Isabel, little babe, are you sleeping? Isabel, my love. Wake up. Julio, my love. Just one of you. Come on, come on, come on, it's alright.. Come on, be quiet. It's all over. How sick I feel! - Mom! - Leave me alone! Come on. Open the window. Get out, get out. It's all over now. - ¡Doctor! - Easy, don't worry. I saw her very sick. Ana, trust in me. Go to the village, be quiet and rest a little. - But Doctor... - ¿Will you? That's better. You can leave, I feel fine. - Good morning, Ana. - Hi. Ana, Ana, wait. Would you like a lift? Where are you going to? Where are you going to? - To the hostel. It's nearby. Besides, you and I must talk. Come on, get on. I feel fine. Washed-up. Ana, if I had to go, will you take care of Isabel? I'll send you dough, money, I mean. All the money you'll need. I hope my mother gets better soon. Of course, so do I. But in the other hand... Yes, I know what you're thinking. - What? - What? That I'm not being true. It's natural. I have the worst character in this story. Mine is the most snubbed one. And I'm not trying to apologize, not at all. But you should have been told such stories about me. Aunt Mercedes for example, your mother... No, Julio. You don't know me, I don't let myself be influenced. Well, well, alright. On the outside things look differents. I've been deep in love with Isabel, and I still love her. But you know, everything change. For better or for worse. Even this country has changed. If we have just been able to able to marry then... Years roll by and then, one day, they say you can do it. But then it's not the same. Things must be done straight away. You have to be brave to admit it. See your mother for example, always obstinated in the same thing. She insists and insists. - It's not so simple, Julio. If we have had children at least. It would also have been different for my mother. - I agree. - In that case... She wouldn't even have thought of me. She wouldn't care about me. Ana, you're a great girl. Hey, would you like to dance? Hey, cheer up! Come on. I warn you I don't know if I remember how to dance, in my times... And so? What do you think? I dance old style, don't I? - No, you dance very well. Do you know? First time I saw I said to myself: This girl doesn't looks like Isabel. She doesn't even looks like my cousin. I don't know... But now I'm sure. I can't explain it. It's something of yours. Something of yours that reminds me of your mother. Julio. ¿Uhm? I'm very tired. Would you mind taking me home? Hello? Why haven't you come yet? I've been waiting for you. - I went to bed very late. - You were with Julio, weren't you? Don't lie to me, I saw you. What has he told you? - Mom, we'll talk in a minute. I'll be there in half an hour. No, don't come here. I don't need anything from you. Not even from anybody. ¡Ana! Hello. - What are you doing here? Well... If you want I stay with you. - Do what you want. You're deep inside me. - Honey, what a way of talking. I'm very racial. Mario hasn't come yet. You like him, don't you? I feel it. What an imagination! We don't even know where he has gone or if he is going to return. He's very handsome. Do you think that Mr. Mario it's only an interesting person? May be, Mrs. know-it-all . May be you're right. He doesn't like me. I'm a big mouth, I tell everything. That's why he runs away.. Ana, do you think he likes me just a little bit? Come on, get up. What will the people think? Ten sentido, mujer. Be sense, girl. Don't worry. Everybody know there are crazies around here. We scare them, they run out... ...and we laugh. Do you know what are we gonna do? We'll write to the priest of his parish. We'll tell him we are Mario's girlfriends and need information. So we'll get informed. - You don't know what you're saying. We'll write on daddy's paper, he is a Colonel. Feelings and love, they all get messed up here. In the meninx, all around, just like a skein, one with each other. - Rita, what's the matter? - It's not my fault. It's my body. The little man I have here, deep inside. He forces me to do it. ¡Come here, please they're gonna kill themselves! Give it up, give it up. Someone separate them, they're gonna kill themselves. What's the matter? What's the matter? You're mad, all the evening looking for troubles. Look for one that likes you, you dirty. Come on, get away, you have had enough. Do you want some more? Come boy, you don't learn your lesson, you ain't got no solution. Do you know him? Is from the village? Where does he live? - He lives nearby. - What do you care? Who is it? ¡Mario! ¡Mario! What is it? A doctor! A doctor! - What's the matter? - Please, call a doctor. - Mario. - I need you, come with me. I'm here, with you. I know what you wanna tell me. Mario is a married man. - Did you know it? - No. I supposed it. But I wasn't sure. - Doctor, will he be O.K? - Sure. I think so. It depends on him. It's a pity he has started all over again. Here, Ana. It's good? Very good. I like to be the first one tasting my salad. He had made a satisfactory recovery here. Mario is a very sensitive person. And very intelligent. Very much. Now he's totally uncapable to face... ...life with responsability. He's a teenager, a misbehaved child. Demanding, selfish. And his wife? There's no solution for that. They were too young, had to get married. Two months later, Mario left her. He went to Paris and lived on his own. Now everything seemed to go well, an escapade once in a while. Then you appeared. You saw how he's now. Ana, I wanna ask you something. Are you in love with Mario? I don't know. But I'm sure he needs me. I hope you don't get me wrong. Mario is a sick person who carries a great sentimental frustration. If you wanna help him, don't be sorry for him. It would be awful. Why haven't you gone away? Leave me alone, I feel fine. Mom, that's me, Ana. And if you have to guard me, do it from there. Get in the bathroom and leave the door open. It's you. I thought it was that dumb. - How do you feel? - It's all over now. Don't you see it? The other day I just wanted to help you. I know it. Ana, when I was in Caracas and I saw girls of your age, ...I thought, that's how my daughter should be. And I was feeling a very deep emotion. I have also thought of you very much. There was no photo of you at home. Now we're together, but everything has been so different. Everybody have came to see me, they've told me about you and Mario. Be careful, my love. Tell me the truth, Mario. Do you love me? I've been looking for you, just you. Nobody else. You're trembling. Are you cold? I'm scared, Mario. I'm scared. Hello? It's you, Ms. Ana. Good morning. Just a moment, I'll call him. - Yeah, tell me? - Mario, I gotta go to Madrid Julio has come to pick me up. It's urgent. I'll go in his car. I'll be back late at night. ¿Mario? Do you hear me? Do you hear me? - I'll go with you. - What are you saying? I'll go with you to Madrid. We'll return together. But... Wait for me in the crossroad, I'll be there in ten minutes. What a bad luck that I've got to leave so soon. But you know, one is missing and everything is a problem. And I have expert people I trust, otherwise... The saying is becoming true. The master's eye, feeds the horse. The telegram was very clear, I'm really worried. At least you stay here. Well, the notary is wating for us. This is not only in my own good but also in your mother's good. Many of the issues are in her name. It also concerns to you. You're her daughter. ¡Mario! - I'm sorry. - Don't worry, young man. - Hello. - Hello. Julio, Mario. - How do you do? - Pleased to meet you. I've been late a little. - I'm picking you up at six. - Alright, I'll be waiting. - What's the number of the room? - 209. See you later. - Take care, Mario. - Ok. - Bye. - Bye. Hello? The lady, please. No, her daughter, Almudena. Yes, a friend. Thank you. Almudena, listen, I'm Mario. Almudena, wait, don't hang up. Almudena! Almudena! A beer, please. Fan yourself, honey. This is an oven... ...with air conditioning and things like that. There was no need you take the trouble, as I was saying, ...for empowering it's only necessary the owner's sign. 'cos you, little Ana, ...are the one with the rights in tis case. You have nothing to do here. When you have the power in your hands, you can do whatever you want. Moncho, how boring you are. There's no way to stand you. - If I bore you just tell me, Anita. - No, go on if you want. You've grown up, baby. Little Julio, please? That's me. What do you want? Bye bye, little Julio. Little Julio of my heart. Bye bye, little Julio. When will I see you again? Hey, Moncho, it's funny, isn't it? Clowns. It's always the same. I would like to have kicked them out When I had to go to Venezuela, none of them helped me. Now I have dough and they have a good position. Ana, I would like you to give this letter to your mother. - No, no. You can read it. - No, it's better this way. It's something private. - It doesn't matter. You know Isabel and... - You can go on. Maybe she doesn't want to read it. I want you to read it and that she hears it, do you understand? Well. I feel a weight lift off my chest. How pretty you are! Mom! Leave us alone, Mario. Don't make a scene again. - Wait, Almudena, wait. Dad! Chemari! Get out of here! I said get out of here! Leave me alone! You boozer, shirker! My God Chemari. He's mad. Next time I'll kill you. You crap! Mario, don't mess around. Go away. Come on, go away. You can't do anything here. Young gentleman. Young gentleman Mario. Young gentleman Mario, here. Come in here. Here you can loosen it, Maruja. - I thought you were dying. - Almost. This girdle is too small. - Do you have a lipstick? - Yes, in the handbag. Take it. What are you doing here, bore? Little girls are needed. You're not a shy one, are you? What a relief! Hello? Mario? Is that you? Anita, are you going away? Julio, I gotta go. Mario is not coming, he has phoned me. Have a good journey. - Wait, I'll give you a lift. No, don't worry, I'll get a cab You have guests. What a beauty, little Julio, where were you hiding her? Shut up! She's Arturo's daughter. - Goodbye, Ana. - Goodbye. Take care of your mother and keep me informed. Alright. - Mario, what's happened to you? - Just an accident. - An accident? Where? - In no place. - Where's your family? - On holidays. I don't know where. Why do you act like that, Mario? Is it worth acting like that? The other night, when you said that you needed me. I believed you. I'll have done anything to help you. But I was wrong. You don't need me, Mario. You don't love me. Shut up! What do you want? That I tell you my life? I've been very happy in this house. Mario? Mario. Mario! Don't worry. Help me. Do you want me to call a doctor? No. It will be over soon. Like always. There... ...the pills. Give'em to me. Here. Don't worry, I'll go to a drugstore to buy them. Don't move. Be quiet. Give me the keys. The keys, please. I'll be back right away. Mario. Mario! Mario! Look, there's no obituary in the newspaper. The family don't want it to be known. What a tragedy! To end like that. - Mom. - Tell me, dear. Julio has given me a letter for you. - A letter? - Yes. Here. No. No, no, no. I don't want it. - Mom, you must read it. - No, I don't want. I don't want. Tear it up, please. - Do you want me to read it? - No. Oh, come on. Let me read it. Dear Isabel: You can reproach me that I haven't been what you thought. I know it. But I can reproach you the same. Nevertheless, in some way, we've been very happy together. I'll never forget the way you treated me in... ...the worst moments of my life. Now I'm going away. You know, business... But I'll come back to see you. Once a year. And if I can, twice a year. No, you're lying, lier. You won't come back. Go on. Take care of yourself. I want you have anything you need. I know my duties, and if we're... ...lucky and you feel better, ...you can travel to Caracas if you want. Goodbye, Isabel. Julio. He won't come back, Ana. He won't come back. I know it for sure. I've lived and I'm lonely in the end. I'll come to see you every sunday. I'll never leave you. We'll be together. How good you are, dear. But this is not a solution. ¡Little Ana, honey! When is Carlos coming back? - The day after tomorrow. Great.
