HISTORY is the TRUTH they want you to REMEMBER. LEGENDS are the TRUTH pushed TOO FAR. MYTHS are the TRUTH that they want you to FORGET. TRUTH IS IN EVERYTHING Well, bring it. Come on! Come on here! What is it? What is? Come on. Come on, grab it. Yes, grab it. Come on! Come on! Hey! Where are you? Little one! Where are you? WOLF - HE WILL GET YOU What do you think about? Suspiciously calm. There are only a few people left in the direction of the Levante wind, it says at least. Well, one likes to hear that. The gods seem angry. Oh yes? It is cold, windy. Clouds never lie. Then the gods are probably always angry here. In any case, there are enough savages here that could show gratitude. An offering would be a start. At the end of winter we sacrificed three goats in Pescara. The hottest summer followed that even the elders had ever experienced. The wine of the year... How did I know that the story ends with wine? You know me almost as well as the gods. And that's why they sent me here. Stop! Let's have a rest here. I had a divine inspiration last night, Liviana. It can happen every day that I become a father. You will be there You are saying that as if it was easy. The further we march... We'll be back soon. I would not be so sure about that. Brother, we are persecuting four legionaries who have a message for the Pict King and his great army. It was said that he was camping somewhere here. The further we march, the less I believe that this army even exists. What does this mean? Four days' walk, and no human soul in sight. Now tell me that is not strange. No campfires, no scouts, nothing at all. Maybe lma just led us safely. Your job is either our missing men or to find their murderers, but not to ensure our safety. I would feel safer if a dog led us. With a dog you at least know that he is loyal. Where are we exactly? The main thing is there soon. It's a strange feeling to be so far from the wall. Me too. Since we have been in this country I don't remember where my head is. We are all alien to each other, have no horses, are poorly equipped... Keep an eye on the target, Aurelius. This is the land of great opportunities. And by that I mean the opportunity to leave a good impression with Domitius. When the men we're looking for are dead then there are two good positions to fill. Grackus and Nerva will not be promoted anyway, that's for sure. I made the crossing with them. No, no, neither of them has what it takes to be a centurion. Listen to my words: we impress Domitius! Domitius. How long should this go on? Until I am convinced that Rome has nothing to worry about and until we found our men. Do you have something to say? Four men are missing. Maybe they ran away? Roman legionaries don't run away. Especially not when they bring a message from Rome to the Pict King. We haven't even seen farmers let alone this legendary army. We are also not looking for farmers. Oh, maybe you don't. Where there are farmers, there are also pretty daughters. It's been four days. I'm almost ready to... You could still learn something. It would cut your eggs off. Keep your eyes open. Your relationship with Domitius is rather unusual. A man of his class makes a friendship with a former slave. I didn't want to get too close to you. But it is unusual. No trace of this "army". So it seems the advice was wrong. We should turn back, Domitius. You already miss your bed? I would be reluctant to report to your superiors have to mention something of negligent danger to your men. Every day we don't spend under the protection of the wall is another that brings us closer to that fate, which apparently has overtaken those we are looking for. This could lead to some displeasure. Almost sounds like Augustus has lost the Roman spirit. We stay here. One day more, then we'll travel back. They certainly would not have gone any further than this. You can thank Augustus for this. He doesn't make it any further. I thank you, gods. I am so hungry. Everyone has to eat something. I don't know anyone who eats as much as you do. I am a Roman. I eat like Caesar and I fight like Caesar. Excuse me, how was that? Eat like Caesar? Stop abusing his name. Not that the gods are still punishing us with snow. And while we're talking about food, Vinicius, take care of the fire. Liviana, prepare the meat, and, Nerva, get us wine. You seem to like giving orders. Only when it comes to wine. Especially when it comes to wine. I should go watch out. Better safe than sorry. It is still bright enough. You should be eating. I take some food with me. All right. -But not too far. -Yes. The hill over there I've often set up camp there. Maybe they're there. I will see it. And, lma... I thank you. Why don't we stay there? If our men were really captured, we do well not to follow in their footsteps. That's why we have a scout. Hey be careful. Now relax, brother. You confuse me. And how is that? You said we shouldn't trust her. We still have to take care of each other. Together we are stronger. She doesn't have much experience as a scout. She joined us only a few weeks ago. Sounds like you're more interested in them than in me. Know your enemy. Wait, are we still talking about Ima or your wife? It's enough for me, brother. After returning home I will be transferred to the training camp. Certainly? My son shouldn't grow up without a father. I want to be there for him. Like my father for me. If I were as skillful with your sword as you are, I would not be concerned It's not about fighting. I fear that Unexpected. Trust the gods. Trust the gods. Then let's make Bacchus gracious. More wine. Bacchus will be very happy with me if I... Get ready. What is it? Quiet! Augustus. Salvius. To me. Form! Salvius, look after Augustus. Form! To me. Come on. You're welcome. Let me live. You're welcome! Everything OK. Coming. We have to go back. Was that it already? Where they came from, there will be more. Then they should come, I'm not afraid. You saved my life. That's how brothers are. We should move on. Take only what you absolutely need. The less the better. That before. Something like that happened to my people. My mother. Another tribe had done it. I was very young. That's why my father joined Rome. So what is that? The less the better, he said. Oh well, that's it for me with the chain mail. Pict tool. Not that bad. I take whatever the gods give me. Hey should anything happen to you I have an eye on your shield. At Mars, what can someone do? -What did they do to him? -She? These were not picts. He is an elder someone who asks the Highland Winds for protection for their warriors. He didn't do his job too well. He did not deserve that. You disappear and we are attacked. Strange coincidence, isn't it? I am German, not a Pictin. For someone who is not one of them, you know a lot about picts. This man wasn't just killed. It was literally mangled. How could someone do it so quickly? Maybe it was more than just one. Maybe, but more of what? It doesn't make sense. There are footprints, but... But what? Footprints of animals, wolves, People. Do you now have an alliance with wolves? You can't trust a wolf. Neither a Picts. Or a German. It is enough. Whatever killed this man is a danger to all of us. You mean there are more of them? It can't be far yet and it must have left a trail of blood. Let's go on the search! The full moon is a good omen. The gods are delighted with the death of these savages. We should pursue this group of wolves and men. Maybe that was a rival tribe? Very unlikely. She tries to cover her again. If the Picts have wolves, they'll hunt us. It looks like this in the footsteps. We are Romans. It is up to us to hunt. Whatever it is, we have to see it. We have to find out what it is. Salvius, you and Augustus are waiting with Aurelius and Lucius. Keep the fire alive. I call that a good legionnaire. It never hurts to know where you are. But only swords. We have to be quick. When we get back I could go to the Council and have Nerva reprimanded. When you look at me, what do you see? I'm sorry, I don't quite understand. Oh yes, you do. Do you see a free person? A legionnaire? Or a slave? I just want to help you. Nerva may have many sides and there are bound to be moments when he sees me as a slave. But if we draw the swords don't worry, we'll be like brothers. I'm just offering you my help. We both know what you're up to. I'm just following Domitius' orders. Try your games with someone else. Now don't get so excited. We got something, but what should these savages say? There will be many ways for us to prove ourselves. And with Jupiter, when the opportunity is there, we take it. What was it? When they throw the Christians to feed the lions in the Coliseum, they sometimes end up like the poor drip there. Why should it tear him like this? For fun? Maybe rabid. Rabies or not. He should get to know me. Domitius! Grackus! What kind of animal was that? Looks like wolf claws. Something like that, but not quite. They are much too big for a wolf. And what kind of wolf runs on two legs? What do you mean by that? This animal, whatever it is, is walking on its hind legs. And how do you want to know that? No prints that overlap. Have you ever seen something like this? Maybe a bear? Not big enough. I didn't ask you. She is right. Too small. Do you think that killed the old man? See how deep the prints are. This beast, whatever it is, is damn fast. It is, um... What? Grackus! It resembles a person, but then again it doesn't. No. It makes no sense. Help! Help! Move. Move! I specifically said it should be quiet. Shields up. Keep eyes open. -What's going on here? - Something attacked us. Did you see it? No, it hit me on the floor. What did you see? I dont know. What do you mean you don't know? You called for help. It was so terrible and fast, everything was blurry. Where are the others? You chased him. Caution. I think I got it. We take this beast to Rome's glory. To our glory! It looked terrible. I don't understand, why didn't it attack? It did it quickly and violently. You fought back and Salvius landed a hit. Then it is gone. It hit me in the face with such a blow that I dropped the sword and shield. I was just able to pull my dagger and stab it. It cried out and ran away. Before I knew what had happened we were alone and he cried for help, the coward. Could you get over it? I guess so. It has lost blood. Attention! We have to go after him. If it bleeds, there is a good chance we will find it. What about the men They have to manage on their own. We have to help them, Domitius. I told them to stay here, Nerva. We fight together like a man. And we stay together too. And should this be a trap we won't just walk in there. Aren't we trapped long ago? Turn off the fire. -But we... -We follow Domitius orders. There it is! Lucius? It's just an animal, nothing more. An animal that mangled a man and gutted his gut before we even knew what was going to happen. Domitius is right. Maybe it was the savages. They want to separate us, they play with us. Whatever attacked me wasn't just a trick. Wolf packs often try to separate the weakest member of a group from the rest in order to hunt it better. I want to save men just like every one of you but Domitius is right. We have to stay together. Maybe that's the fate of the missing? Killed by Picts or lacerated by their beasts. But Picts don't fight like that, I think... You think? What? It is noticeable that we were attacked when you disappeared. So what do you think now, huh? Ima was looking for traces. I know exactly where she was and that was it on the subject. We're staying here tonight. We stay awake. And together. And in a ball formation. Certainly? The ball formation? -The bullet is... -I know its purpose. The sun will soon rise. Grackus Well, ball formation to me. To me. Your spear please. Wrong time, wrong place. The others just don't trust you. -And you? -You are alive. Without my trust you wouldn't be anymore. Taking my spear is like a death sentence. At least give me a pugio. I pray that we are wrong. You'll get it back tomorrow morning. Grackus? At your command. As soon as it gets light, we leave. Do you really think there could be more than one? I strongly believe that. Do not worry. Hunting is our specialty. Aurelius! Let's go back to the others. It's a wound, nothing more. I chased it away. Let's go, come on now. It is coming. Well, we're standing around in this stupid formation, aren't we? Concentration! May the gods give them protection. It reminds me of our first battle in the area. Then we showed it to the Picte King. They were hiding and then ambushed us nicely. The Picts were adamant. If we had had as many men as her, it would have been a tough fight. But so outnumbered, more and more stormed in on us. With their painted, teeth-bared faces. They killed one after the other. We didn't give up. But as more and more men fell in the face of this barbaric army, I didn't believe in seeing the next sunlight. Another legion came to our aid but they also suffered heavy losses. Our salvation was the ball formation. Ball formation! Ball formation! Ball formation! Come on! Come on. Come on. Come on! Come on! Ball formation! Come on! Come on! Come on! Fast! So, men, hold your positions. The gods are definitely laughing at us. The same thing again, just a few weeks later. We will toast to his honor. -In Rome. -In Rome. In Rome. Domitius, we shouldn't just be standing around here. We should be out there like warriors who hunt the beast and help our men. This somehow feels cowardly. He's right. We are Rome! We are Rome. And as Romans, we do as we are told. Exactly. Swords! What was that? Keep Calm. Reorganize. That is more than one. I could swear I got her but my blade is clean. There's nothing on mine either. Then aim better! Salvius, where did you hit it? I dont know. I just stabbed. Whatever it is, it's too fast. Not for me! Goes on the neck and under the arms. Nice on the soft spots. There! Vinicius! -Form! -Order. Liviana! Form! Liviana! Come back in the formation! Liviana! We have to help her. To Nerva. Stay together. We have no chance in isolated cases. Take it. Oh no. Form. As soon as the sun comes up, we are gone. Form. Three dead. One dead, two missing. Three dead. A little bit of snow and this thing is still out there. And the gods watch. Whatever that was. I swear I'll kill it. You do not take the oath alone. Why did it do it? Why did it leave him there? Without it, it can move faster. We fought back like Romans, it must have fled. Even rabid animals rarely fight. Then what did it want from us? What kind of animal is hit without bleeding? Not a drop? What now? We have seen enough. We have to go back to the wall. We won't leave him behind. Definitely not. He did not deserve that. He is dead. There is nothing we can do for him. -Or for the others. -What do you know? We have to burn it or bury it. The gods demand it. That is grotesque. We don't have time to worry about a dead man. -We should... -Then I'll just stay here and do it alone if need be. You're not alone. Domitius! -Liviana is right. -But... It wouldn't be very wise to anger the gods now, would it? I don't allow you to look for the others. But bury your friend. We have to get out of this forest as soon as possible. The beast could still be here. Nerva! Salvius! Keep watch. It was more than just one, with the gods. I'm sorry I couldn't save you. But I swear to you if I find whatever did that to you I'll etch a name in his chest forever. Good journey, my friend. We'll meet again. May Mercury guide you safely. May Minos, Rhadamanthys and Aiacus judge you fairly. You never thought that would be waiting for us, would you? What do you have in mind You immediately agreed to come along. You would do the same for me. Not a difficult decision. That's why I regret asking you. Domitius. You know something? What is it? Come on, come with me. We were ordered to find our men. The four messengers who had been sent to the King of Picts. Rome wanted to offer help to the Picts because we had learned of a plague that spread among her husbands. A plague? Ordinary legionnaires should never know. They are not ordinary legionaries. You are my legionnaires. Rome asked the king for peace, knowing that the plague would weaken her. That makes sense. You should have just let them suffer and then destroyed them. That is not the Roman way. We offer peace first, then war. Join or go under. We were at risk of infection if the plague were really that bad. Therefore, you are now the volunteers to find out how bad the plague really is. And why the messengers didn't come home. Maybe they fled? Antonius led the group. He is like a brother to me, a fighter as he is in the book. I assure you if the Council hadn't asked me I would have voluntarily searched for him. When we were attacked, Ima was where I suspected her camp was. I found nothing but this ring and blood. This ring belonged to Antonius. Much blood... It is Roman. That means they are dead. And that means we're in the middle of a trap. We were fooled. There is no disease. It was just a trick to lure us here. Maybe, maybe. Or these beasts are the plague. I've heard of similar illnesses. With Venus, you are about to say that wings are growing or something? We ran straight into the trap, designed by the King of Picts. So he forced us into open combat. Kings don't set traps. Well, kings don't live surrounded by sheep shit either. In my experience, they're more surrounded by smelly creatures like you, for example. So our men died in vain? Lucius and Aurelius may still be out there somewhere. Vinicius was the best fighter we had. If he hasn't survived... What you said earlier, Liviana, that we are surrounded may be true. We're either in the middle of a Pict King trap, or in the midst of a plague the animals are transformed into humans, or Or the other way around. We have to leave. The men on the wall need to know. And what do we tell them, Domitius? What we saw That the plague exists. That there can be no peace with these picts. So what! Finally reasonable words. Set out! Such a cold of pigs. What do you have? I thought there's something between the trees. Not really. I'm just irritable. Be irritable. That increases attention. I have an idea, that these beasts will attack us again. Probably at night. Just a hunch. What is your intention What do you mean? My intention? It is three days' walk to the wall. I plan to get us there as soon as possible. I was talking about the beasts. We keep moving. Keep us away as much as possible. Even if we can do it. So what? The ninth legion will come and take care of it. I think there is another alternative. And that would be? We catch one of them. What? We could take advantage of the plague, Domitius. These beasts, humans, whatever they are, think of the possibilities. Options? What if they went to battle for us, hey? They would frighten our opponents, you saw it! We would be the most powerful men. Even more powerful than gods. Fight fire with fire. Are you crazy? I may be the only one here who is clear-headed. This animal attacked us all, and it would almost have caught us. It is a gold mine. A powerful weapon of the gods, destined to destroy the Picts once and for all. Look behind me. What do you see? Just yesterday we lost three men. We wouldn't have the slightest chance. Certainly not. And not today. We march towards the coast and then to the wall. Wouldn't it be faster to go south straight away? Too obvious. And by the river we have to worry about one side less. Your idea? Well. Is it bad? No. You are getting slow. The gods seem angry. Stop! Here we take a break. Is that what you expected, Grackus? What? When you were told to go to Britain. It's almost like it was yesterday. I had just returned from the Germanic wars. I expected to be promoted and stationed in Rome, at least for a while. And suddenly everyone congratulated me. I didn't know what was happening to me. Oh yes, one by one. And then he comes to me and he asks: What are they all doing? So I say: congratulate you? What else? For what? And I just couldn't help it, so I yelled it out. Britain, brother. Britain. We are stationed in Britain. And I'm thinking about promotion. Then he said: When being promoted means being pissed off daily by the gods and going to the only place in the Roman Empire, on which there is no wine, then yes: you have been promoted. I was so angry. At Orcus, I said I don't believe a word but if you're right, I'll keep a beard And here we are. A very lonely place. Who would live here Someone who copes well on their own. Looks deserted. Well, there's only one way to find out. Who's there? -He is blind. -Blind. But not deaf. Maybe he has the plague. No disease, no. Just blind. We don't want anything bad for you. But something to eat would do us good. A little rest from the long journey. You smell strange. -We are Romans. -Ah, Roman shit. Careful, old man. Coming. Eat with me I don't have much. But I like to share. If it says "death or taxes" I choose taxes. I'm waiting out here. You lost men? How do you come up with that? Romans always travel in groups of ten, isn't that so? You seem to know your way around. A little. We were ambushed. He knows something. You bet. You have the key to conquer the plague with you, -which haunts my country. -What does this mean? I can only tell you what hungry scouts tell an old man in return for bread and shelter. I'm sorry about your friend. He was a good legionnaire. Just like the others. Did you know her well You only joined us last week. You should also wash yourself. Come on. The old man was right. We probably really stink. You should be eating. I will. I can understand that; that you don't trust me Beautiful here. Is not it? Beauty can be deceptive. This country is our enemy. At the time of the last full moon, a young man the son of a farmer in the area attacked and nursed back to health. But then he had a fit and started to change. Transform? Do something! I don't know how to help him. It became a beast. What a story. And you know how to kill them? I don't know anything, I only hear. Please continue. The farmer's son changed and attacked the workers. One of them had found a Roman dagger, a pugio, a few weeks earlier and stabbed the man with it. Where did he stab? In the chest? I can swear I caught one. What about your back That was my brother. It's complicated. I have a sister. We had so much nonsense in our heads. Say do you see your Bruderje? Can we go Not the "where" is decisive, but the "with what." A pugio? The blade is partly made of silver. The guy is lying. What reason would I have to lie? Anyway, this smells like a trap. He lures us here, distracts us with his chatter. Grackus, you calm down now. I say: let's kill him. Surely you haven't figured out yet that they get their power from the full moon. It is not clear to you that you are doomed to die. I will show you who is doomed here. Why are we sitting here listening to this chatter? It is enough! We thank the gods for your words, wisdom and your food. We have a beast to kill. -What are you doing? -I can smell it. What? Hope dies like vines in the frost. A scratch and a man's heart is contaminated. Evil comes from Germania, from the Black Forest. It was a curse on the son of a Roman who killed a wolf pup. Evil, it lurks in the Black Forest. It's still lurking there. It took my eyesight off. It made me listen to how the world screams in pain. What are you talking about? Curses? A black forest? This old man said he spoke to Picts. Maybe his story is the trap. Fighting beasts with daggers... You are probably used to smaller swords. What else did he say to you, Grackus? Just more old man's chatter. We should have killed him. Its very existence is punishment enough. Death would be a redemption for him. A life shrouded in darkness. Surprising words from a slave. Former slave. Words on a subject I have much more on I have to say as a man for whom salvation is nothing more than a jug of wine at the end of the day. I think she's confusing us. Do you need some water? Spare me your pity. Pity? I just wanted to help you. What in the world could you do to help me? Let's be honest for a moment, please. I do not belong here, I'm not one of those people and I am definitely not one of you. And why did you choose to be here? I have decided nothing. The council made the decision. I have expressed my reservations but I fell on deaf ears. I would have known what situation we would get into. What is it? Wait here. Are you crazy? It is probably nothing. But I have to be sure. -Then let's get the others. -And attract more attention? But what if it's the beast? My screams will make everyone know that she is coming. That is pure madness. What are you doing I'm waiting for Ima. She thinks she saw something between the trees. What? And you just let them go? All alone? She ordered me to. -What kind of man is she? -What's going on there? Ima thought she saw something between the trees and went to check. When she's gone we should better prepare for an attack. Grackus, are you still worried about the wound? Alright. It's just a wound. No need to worry. We better split up. We have to stay together. These beasts are out there. It's time to get rid of them anyway. Domitius, what do you think when we use our Pugio, instead of swords. As the blind man said If I ram my sword into one of the beasts and it doesn't die, then I use my pugio. Not a bit earlier. Let us trust the Pugio. For me it worked. If you say that, I'll do it for you. These beasts are so fast, it's up to us before we can change our minds, let alone the weapons. We should move on. And what about Ima? She shouldn't have gone away. May the gods watch over them. Swords! Forward march. Move. Move. Nerva and Grackus, is the rearguard. Shields! Run! Run! Run! Run! Runs Run! What now? The old man said you can kill her. If these beasts want a fight, they should get one. That was the smartest sentence of the day. -The night is coming. -Have you got a better idea? You can go if you want. -Salvius, sure you will... -Accept the others? Yes. Stay together! Keep calm. If they come, we'll fight. We should run away. Run for our lives and don't look back. 'Warning:' | ma? That was close. The screams can be heard all over the forest. He's right. -We have to do something. -Domitius? Maybe it uses them as bait. And when have we seen her fight? It is a trap. We need a decision. Summanus warns us of impending danger. We continue to march to the wall. Ima? I... Quiet! I have to get out of here. What are you doing with a picict? Shields. Swords. That is Augustus. Where is he? Dead. We cannot say that with certainty. That was the cry of a dying man. You know that. And I know it. We have heard such screams before. Too often. -Grackus! -What do you have, brother? Nothing. He was wounded when we were in the ball formation. Just like me. Do you remember what the blind man said about the farmer's son? If you are wounded but not dead, you change. Do you believe this blind fool? Grackus! We have to get to the wall as soon as possible. We all. We are being followed by at least two. I can smell it. We have to go. To the wall! You are not going anywhere. Running! We have to go. Run! Come on! Go on. Force me. Force me. Get out of my way, brother. Better think it over again. I don't want to have to kill you, brother. Follow them if you have to. I'll knock out as much time as I can Brothers. You were always the better fighter of us. And you the better man. If we find ourselves in the Elysium, Pour the wine with the least dead. Immediate death, the thought of wine. After that, we first need a good drop. They keep biting me. Why don't they kill us? Because they want us to change. Kill me, brother. That is the only way out. Kill me. Domitius! We have to make our way to the wall. -The wall is the only way out. -We will not be able to do it. But! Domitius, the wall is so far away. We will not make it. When night falls, these beasts will grow even stronger. We have to face them now. Together. Salvius is right. Neptune has blessed us. We can follow the river to the wall. But what now? If there are too many, we have no chance. But if there are only a few, maybe we can chase them away. We need to draw their attention to us so that we can fight them here and now. Form! Mars, god of war, Chariot leader with a golden helmet, armored in bronze, Protector of cities, Shield holder, with a strong hand, steadfast, powerful with the spear, Protector of Rome. Aurelius? Yes, that is him. Here comes another one! Blossom! That is for Vinicius. That is Lucius. Let's go. Grackus said two were going to chase us. Two are dead now. | times The sun will soon set. More will come. Your wounds, Domitius... You did well. Who are you? I am Eithne from the Attacotti tribe. Do you do anything together with them? We don't deal with wolves or beasts. You are not trustworthy. Just like Romans. Then Rome must earn your trust. May this be the beginning. You have to kill me before I change. Domitius... Can you make it to the wall? You have to be prepared. Show them how to kill this beast. It is time for me to go to the Elysium. Give me an honorable death, Liviana. The death of a legionnaire. Why was Ima with you? You saved me. -The beast wounded you? - women do not change. Your friend said she had been wounded many times. She is right, I saw the scars. We make it to the wall. I will guide you for sure. For Rome. For the end of this curse.
