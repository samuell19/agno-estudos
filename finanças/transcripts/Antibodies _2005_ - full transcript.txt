"IF THERE IS NO GOD... ...EVERYTHING IS ALLOWED." FYODOR MIKHAILOVICH DOSTOEVSKY The world is unfair. Even to people like us. Pedro Alonso L?pez, "The Monster of the Andes", committed 300 sex murders. Now, 20 years later, who remembers him? Not a soul. Jack the Ripper is world-famous, and for what? Five bitches. Five! And Charlie Manson? That hippie they called "Our Emperor", but he didn't even commit one murder himself. POLICE Hello? - Police. You called? - Finally! My God. Up there. That's where the screams came from. - Is Bosowski here yet? - Wouldn't you know it if he was? Make sure he doesn't show up too soon. I'll bet 10-to-1 that this jerk-off is our jerk-off. Move away, we're taking over now! Come on! Lights! Behind you! I got you, jerk-off. I'm innocent. I'm innocent. What are you doing? - Are you going hunting? - Why are you up already? What is this? You're 13 years old. - It won't happen again. - Finish up before your mom gets up. You said I could come. Not this time. Schimanski! HERZBACH A HAPPY PLACE ANTIBODIES Schimanski! - Who's that? - That's Holy Saint Michael. There you are, thinking there's no evil in the world. Stupid animal! Well? They're keeping out of sight. All right. Why are we here? I was talking to Rosa. I hate to see my daughter cry. I'm a good husband. Anyway, it's no business of yours. Wrong! Everything is my business. And you treat her badly. That's not true. - I can't imagine she told you that. - I have eyes in my head. Listen, boy. - I know Rosa is starting to show her age. - Is that why you wanted to talk? I heard you want us all to give saliva samples. - Who told you that? - Is it true? - It's an idea... - Oh, really, "an idea". How long will you keep telling people that there's a sick murderer among us? - Until I know there's not. - One and a half years without a clue. Now you crown your incompetence by planning to humiliate us all. - I'm just doing my duty. - Oh, we should be grateful that God sent such an upright person to our small community. It's too late anyway. I have authorization. The federal experts are coming next week. It's also an opportunity to regain the peace... Are you crazy? You should think it over again... Carefully. Schimanski! Schimanski! I'll have a look at what wandered into my sights. You twisted bastard! Sick swine! Asshole! You idiot! Stop it! Will you stop! Stop! Why did you do it? I don't know what you're talking about. It must've just wandered into my sights. No idea. Then it was an accident. - A hunting accident. Happens all the time. - You're sick. You're sick. Go on, bury your dog. Sarah, Christan, the bus is here! Hello, angel. Christan! I'll not drive you to school again. Great. Only hours ago, a breakthrough was reported in the serial murder case. "Crucifix," the special unit headed by Chief Commissioner Seiler, arrested a suspect in Berlin. The arrest ends the gruesome series of murders and the manhunt that had kept the police and the nation in suspense for over six years. Together with a team of experts, we drew up a suspect profile... Yes? I'm watching it now. No, he's out hunting with my dad. Bosowski? I don't even know where he is. Bosowski, there you are. Always at the ready. As usual. I wanted to congratulate you on your stroke of luck. "Luck and competence go together." Bugs Bunny. You think you're pretty smart, Seiler. - But I've been in this game longer. - What? - No rejoicing at the victory of the good? - You did me in once, but I'll kick your ass. Yes, I've heard that you swing both ways... You are flying high, Icarus. Let's talk. - On my terms. - Asshole! - You need me. - We have you. The forensic unit just left your place, and we can already prove you committed nine murders. I know you did more. You and I have lots of work to do, so stop jerking off. Get used to me instead. I'm the toughest gorilla in the cage, and there are no terms. School's starting soon. The kids will be buying their notebooks and colored pencils for the new school year. First-graders choose their rucksacks. They have no idea that life will only have shit to offer. - Don't assume that everyone is like you. - In the store, there's a display. That's where the fancy things are, the ones the rich kids buy to make the others jealous. There are La Strosse notebooks, bound in leather. Bound in red leather. That's what I want. That and crayons. So that I don't hurt myself. Those are my terms. - Crayons? - Yes. - A little red notebook? - By La Strosse. A red notebook. - That's it? - That's it. - No lawyer? - What for? That's what I always say. Once I have my red notebook, I'll tell you whatever you want to know. Then I am completely at your disposal. We're playing. Good. When did you murder the first time? It was him, Martin Saales. June 6th, 1996. He was a floating ray of light. Meiser? I need something from the stationary shop. A red notebook, made by La Strosse. And crayons. What's going on here? - Karl? What is this? - It was just on the news. What? They have him. They caught the swine. Who? You know who we mean. Now we'll have peace and quiet again. Let's wait and see. You've tested our patience for long enough. I won't hear any more of it. That's it. Or else what? Will you shoot one of my horses? Now let me through, or I'll arrest you for obstructing state authority. They don't understand. They think it should be over. - I don't understand either. - We still don't know if it was him. The Feds thinks so. Everyone thinks so. It's not over until he's proven guilty. Just believing in our innocence isn't enough. Faith is enough, even for God. God can see into our hearts. Who else can do that? The boy was beautiful. A little angel of darkness. He and his nasty friend inflated frogs until they burst. Ever seen how that works? You shove a straw in its mouth, so it can't shut it. Then they inflate more and more. Works with cigarettes, too. Makes a nice smoke cloud when it explodes. - I'll bet you know all about it. - I'm from the country. We all did it. We didn't have any gays to bash. Even more fun is tying two cats together by the tail... Martin Saales! I knocked him out with chloroform and dragged him into my VW van. I'd dreamt about it for so long. I couldn't hold back. I fucked him while he slept. Then I drove to my place. I chained him to the table, and he woke up. He spoke so calmly, asked me to let him go. Brave little boy. Naked and trembling all over. But he didn't cry. I took pictures. You know, crucifix pictures. He lay there, not really as innocent as I would've liked. But still, much purer than I. Next time I'd take a purer soul, a more innocent, a more worthy victim. I cut his legs open with a scalpel. He screamed. I was hard. I stuck my pulsating... Hey, are you jerking off? - You sick pig! - Hey! Pig! Is that a grave? Yes. Schimanski? Yes. Hunting accident. I'm sorry. He was a good dog. He'll go to Heaven. Should I help? No, go... Better go inside and do your homework. Dear God, we thank you for this gift, for always having enough to eat, not like the poor children in Africa, for having it as good as we do. And pretty please, let Schimanski into Heaven with you. Make sure that he can hunt rabbits there, but that they're faster than he is, for nobody should die in Heaven. - Amen. - Amen. People are pretty excited about the arrest. I know. Does this mean it's over? It's not over for the Flieders. - What, for their sake, you're... - Please, not at dinner. Your son has problems at school. - What happened? - I don't know yet. - Mrs. Wagner wants us to stop by. - The teacher said Christan's a little devil. What happened, Christan? Let's hear it from you. Did you get into another fight? Miriam said he showed her his penis. Is that true? - No. - Don't lie to me. I didn't show it to Miriam. Thomas dared me, so I showed Laura. But not Miriam. - Laura told Miriam, who told everybody. - He also wanted to see her vagina. - Not true, you tattle-tale! - You be quiet! If you behaved, your sister wouldn't be a tattle-tale. Why did you do that? Why did you behave so indecently? I don't know. You don't know why you showed Laura your member? What's so funny? Do you think it's intelligent to do something that gets you in trouble without knowing why? No. Do you think it was worth it? No. Then maybe you should learn to think before you act. And decide whether what you're about to do is decent or indecent. Yes. So? What is it? Indecent. And what should we do with you? Can you tell me that? After dinner, you'll get your notebook and write, "It's indecent to show my penis" 500 times. I'm going home. Bye. It's been like this for hours. He won't say anything. That's all for today. You are going to talk. You're going to talk. Michael, maybe we should talk to Dr. Kares. - Let's not read too much into it. - He just can't - cope with it. - It was one and a half years ago. You can't excuse everything with that. The boy... The two of them were friends. My God, Michael, we're not even over it. What do you expect of a 13-year-old boy? I doubt that exposing his dick is a sign of his sadness for Lucia! He's a boy, he's 13... He needs moral discipline. Moral discipline? He has that already. I won't let a psychiatrist ruin my boy. It might help if you just hugged him, like you used to do. Maybe it'd help you both. MISSING PERSONS REPORT FLIEDER, LUCIA LOCAL INQUIRIES HAVE SO FAR TURNED UP NO RESULTS Hey, what's going on? What happened? I just wanted to scorch it a little. That tattle-tale's always telling on me! I'll be watching you. I won't let you out of my sight! I won't let you go astray! Not my son! Not my son! Thus spoke the sinners. Let us lie in wait for the righteous, for he is inconvenient to us and opposes our actions, and reproaches us for sins against the law. He professes to know God, and calls himself a child of the Lord. The very sight of him is a burden to us, because his life is unlike that of others, and his ways are completely strange. Let us see if his words are true, and let us test what will happen at the end of his life. - It can't be true. - ...run away... Take the kids home. I'll be there for dinner. What is it, Esther? I don't know. Tamara's gone. - Wasn't she in her play group? - No, I thought she was sick. She never did that before. - Where are the kids? - Outside. They'll be back for dinner. - What's wrong? - Tamara Gabhart is missing. We're going to wait one more hour and then look for her. You think... She wasn't in her play group and she's not at home. She's probably out playing. Sarah! Christan! Sarah! Christan! Christan! Tamara! Tamara! Tamara! Tamara! Out! Out! I just phoned with Seiler. I'm going there tomorrow. To the city? What for? You think they need you? I need myself there. What about the harvest? It can wait. If I have to stay longer... The others will help you. - We'll share the harvest. - But we need it all. We have plenty. We've never had plenty, with the part-time job you have. - Without my father's... - This is a nightmare. And it'll never stop. Never! This town needs to regain its peace. And you can regain it? No. But he can. - Talk to your dad! - What the hell? You fag, I'll kick your ass! He hasn't talked in weeks. At first he wouldn't even stop to catch a breath. The psycho-quacks think he's manic and suicide-prone. I think he just wants to jerk off, while speaking. - When can I see him? - At 5:00. But I don't think it'll be any use whatsoever. At least I have to try. Why? The guy admitted to 14 murders, almost all of them children. He was in your area at the time of Lucia Fiedler's murder, - and it was his style. - Flieder! Lucia Flieder! - He only killed boys. - No. He only confessed to killing boys. You've never questioned a criminal, or a murderer. Let alone the biggest jerk-off in our united fatherland. I like you, farmer, and I think you did a perfect job on your case out there. But this plan of yours is a waste of time. Go sightseeing! Go to a brothel! We know it was him. I'll eat my wallet if he so much as speaks a word to you. Do you have a plan? - I have a stomachache. - That's normal. These guys can be pretty scary. Michael. Do you know the holy trinity of serial killers? Playing with fire, tormenting animals and bedwetting. Those are their common youth experiences. If he tries to make you nervous, just envision him as a bed wetter. Okay? - It helps, you'll see. All right? - All right. Okay. Your turn. The psychiatrist is done for the day. - Anything? - Not a word, in the last two hours. No idea why he insists on my visit. A waste of taxes. Who did you expect, Hannibal Lector? - Gabriel Engel, and who are you? - Knock it off. - Michael Martens. - Oh, an alliteration! I'm happy to see you've rediscovered your voice, buddy. - You and your hand not getting along? - Tell him to leave us alone. I'll tell you what you want to know, but only you. Send those fuckers away. Would you please leave us alone? Does he know we're listening? Yes. Let's hope he doesn't blab. Hey, that's my coffee! May I? So what do you want to tell me? What do you want to know? Did you kill Lucia Flieder? That's what you want to know? Yes. Is that all? Yes. If you want me to help you, you better not lie. - I'm not. I'm asking if you killed her. - That's not what you want to know. - I don't understand. - You're wasting my time. I thought you were different. What do you think I want to know? Why am I here? Do you think you're a good person? I'm not worried about that. Admit it, you do. Let's not start our relationship with a lie. You're good, I'm evil. Those are the roles. Did you kill Lucia Flieder? But what about when you fuck your wife? What goes through your mind? What do you think? Did you kill her? Do you think, "I'll fuck you till you burst"? You see her writhing and you think, "You nasty slut!" Is that what you think? Or is it worse? - Are you still really good then? - Did you ram that knife into her crotch and slit her open? - No, I didn't. - You're lying. You didn't come all this way from Herzbach to ask me stupid police questions. It's the easiest thing in the world to close a case. Easy. What's in us that lies, steals and murders? Who slit Lucia open and masturbated into her panties? Who fell upon the innocent girl, tore, humiliated, destroyed her? Who does a thing like that? It wasn't me. Her underwear was never found. Only the murderer can know there's sperm on it. I killed 13 boys and a cop. I did it, and I confessed. Compared to some, I'm just an average serial killer. - You know I'm from Herzbach. - How do you think I know? You reek of the countryside. You stink like law and order. Of course I know where Lucia Fiedler comes from. I've been interrogated often enough. What else do you want? Her name was Lucia Flieder. Your question isn't answered, is it? Yes, it is. It was you. You won't admit it. - You don't want us to have peace. - Come on, you never thought it was me. Maybe not, but now I do. I can answer your questions, Michael. I know who did it. Nonsense. What did you think when you came in? - I'm going to go now. - You expected a monster, right? You were disappointed. But I am a monster, we all are. We're the monstrosities of God's creation, his biggest mistake. Come on, what do you think when you fuck? Don't pretend you don't fuck! We all fuck! We're all fuckers! You were right, I'll close the case. The easiest thing in the world. Don't forget, I know. I know who slit open Lucia Flieder. I know, and I can prove it! Ouch! Damn it! What did you think when you came in? What's in us that lies, whores, steals and murders? ...slit her open and masturbated into her panties. What kind of person... You expected a monster, right? I am a monster, we all are. We're the monstrosities of God's creation, his biggest mistake. What do you think when you fuck? Don't pretend you don't fuck! I can answer your question, Michael. I know who did it. Can I lead you into temptation? Excuse me? You've been sitting here for 40 minutes. So either you like me, or you like my suits. Neither one. I was just sitting here. - That wasn't nice of me, was it? - No. A very big faux pas. - May I correct myself? - Just this once. I do like - your suits. - Nice. I haven't had a customer all day. - But I can't always afford what I like. - You won't be able to resist. Fits like a second skin. You can't tell where the suit ends and the man begins. It is very nice. But I... - I'm not big on clothes. - But you should be. They cover over 90% of your body. Whatever you think you may or may not be, you'll always be right. You are what you think you are. I hardly recognize myself. A successful, self-confident and stylish person, that's who you could be. I am having a drink with colleagues shortly. Cheaper than a weekend in Paris, and lasts longer. - I've never been to Paris. - You have a lot to catch up on. Yes. Is there anything else I can do for you? Hey, farmer! Finally! Nice outfit. Where is everybody? I thought we were all going out for a drink. Who else? Just you and me. We're going to have a good time. Alex! What will you have? Listen, your performance was sensational! Since that success, Bosowski's been spinning in circles. But be careful, he'll try to take the credit. - It's dog-eat-dog! But the glory is ours. - But I'm leaving tomorrow. - No, you can't leave! - Don't you think he's lying? He lies whenever he opens his mouth, but he opens his mouth. But he might accidentally - tell the truth. - There's no point. - And you were right, I'm inexperienced. - Hey, farmer, farmer! Please, keep it in perspective. You were good. Professional! Listen, he's into you. Nobody knows how these perverts think. But he wants to talk to you. Okay? Trust me. - He can't control himself. - Do you think he murdered Lucia? As sure as this is a brothel! Yes? Hi, boss. - It's late. - It's been a turbulent day. Have you been drinking? - Yes. - Did he say anything about Lucia? - He said it wasn't him. - So you're coming home. - They need me here for a while. - Who needs you? The Federal Police, Seiler... You should've seen it. After weeks of not talking, he talked to me! I'm not interested. You promised me something. I know. Why do they need you? The can make do without you. The harvest is going bad. One of our cows is colicky. They want me to continue. They said I was "professional". They're using you like everyone else. Really, he only talked to me. He knows who killed Lucia. Great! A lunatic who only talks to you. You can really be proud of yourself. I'll be home soon. Sure. Hello, Michael. - I don't want any company. - Don't worry, I'm not here for company. Hey, farmer, you're a real womanizer! It's all quality checked by the police. - Please sit over there. - Oh, what's wrong? Don't you like me? These are nice tits, aren't they? They're nice, but I'm married. - My friend is a little uptight. - That's okay, I have an idea. Michael. Michael. Michelle, come here. Sit down beside me. Come, sit down, come, sit down. It's not your fault. You really should get yourself laid. It's good for the soul. - I'm going back to the hotel. - I'll pick you up tomorrow. You're staying? I have my hands full. ...who turned away from Rome to found their own cult... Here, take one. I don't take medication. Fine, more for me. What do you think when you fuck your wife? - I won't tell you. - Why? - No need to be embarrassed. - I know what you're up to. You need a fool, someone you can impress. Someone to get you privileges. It's not going to happen. We won't develop any bizarre friendship. No relationship at all. - There are no privileges. - What do you think when you fuck her? Who killed Lucia Flieder? What do you think when you fuck her? How did you know the murderer masturbated on her underwear? What do you think when you fuck her? - Were you there? Was there an accomplice? - What do you think when you fuck her? - What do the squares mean? - What do you think when you fuck her? That I love her. I think that I love her! - While fucking? - Yes. You don't think, "You nasty slut"? No. You don't think about other women? No. - Have you ever cheated on her? - No. One more "no" and I don't talk to you any more. Okay? - Yes. - No more "yes" either. And no lies. What's the point? It's fun. A game. Another rule: no more questions, and stop being so polite. - I won't sit here, following your rules. - No, what you meant to say was, "Screw you and your rules." Am I right? I have Lucia's panties. What? I'd like to know how you... Tell me how you got Lucia's underwear. I was in your area for about a week. I watched the murder happen. - Then tell me who the murderer is. - Ever cheated on your wife? - I haven't. - She ever cheat on you? She hasn't. - How can you be so sure? - I just know. Do you play with yourself? - It happens. - Often? I don't know. - Do you love your wife? - Of course. Are they listening to us? Come on. It's a simple question. Are they listening to us? Holy shit. If you lie... They record every conversation. Shit. - Let's talk about Lucia. - How old is your son? How... - Tell me how you know about my son. - So you have one. Do you believe in God? - I do. - Old Testament or New? I don't know, both. I'll be in jail for the rest of my life. Three meals a day, books, TV, medical care. - I don't know what you mean. - What do you think about that? - You deserve it. - By doing what? By your crimes. I kill 14 people, and that's it? Is that justice? What about an eye for an eye? This isn't justice. - Does he look like you? - Who... - I don't know whom you're talking about. - I'm talking about your son. - He looks like me. - How old is he? Thirteen. - Just how I like them. - I ask you to leave my son out of this! You're being too polite again. - Leave my son out of this. - Do I scare you? - You do not. - Why not? - You're behind bars. - So why not talk about your son? Tell me about the murder. Do you have a photo? Come on. Do you have a photo? - In my wallet. - Show me. Certainly not. What does he look like? He lives. Let's talk about the dead. Is he pure and innocent, with parted hair and a Sunday suit? - Why are you doing this? - I'm sure we would get along. - Me... And your son. - No. No, never. You said "no." You lose! You can't do this. You promised to answer my questions! Where are the panties? Who killed Lucia? You wanted to talk to me. I know you want to tell me. Where's Lucia's... How pathetic. That's the worst attempt at an interrogation I've ever experienced. It'll be my pleasure to document this incident in your file for posterity. How could you put a village cop on this case, our biggest case in 10 years? We got results. I'll say! Thanks to your prot?g?, Engel now knows his cell's bugged. How idiotic! Let's not overdo it. With all due respect, your idea with the recording didn't lead to much, did it? At least Engel admitted he has Lucia's underwear. I would... With your permission, I'd like - to have a look around Engel's apartment. - Tell me, are you kidding me? - Why? I... - Mr. Martens. For strategic reasons, my office is terminating, as of now, your involvement in this case. Stay away from Engel's apartment. Stay away from my agents. You should just leave the city. - We're ignoring his instructions? - Bosowski will be fuming. Go ahead. Have a look around. I've been here often enough. - These pictures... - Sick shit. He painted with his victims' blood. Would you believe it? - Where are the originals? - They were taken in as evidence. Here's where they found the last victim. He killed the boy while the police were at the door already. That's from one of our guys? A cop. Poor bastard. - Why? He survived. - If you can call it that. He's still in a coma. What are you doing? All the obvious leads have surely been checked. So... - I'm looking a bit deeper. - Don't bother. - They used ultrasound and UV-devices. - Better safe - than sorry. - Right you are. In your interrogation, the jerk-off asked you what you think about his punishment. You know, an eye for an eye, and all that. What do you want to know? You think he wishes he were dead? If I could, I'd kill him. And you? These squares... There are 14 of them. And? 14 squares, 14 victims. Just like in his cell. He admitted to all 14 murders. In his cell, he had newspaper clippings pasted onto each square. Until the guard removed them. Among those 14, - is the dead policeman included? - Yes. Then there should only be 13 here. In jail, he knew about the dead cop. But here... Something's not right. Something's not right. - He pasted reminders into the squares? - Yeah, newspaper clippings. What are you up to? - And the apartment next door? - The whole floor's empty. What are you doing? A pair of underwear. A boy's. And full of sperm. Of course. Hey, Michael! Michael... This is girls' stuff. Lucia. Full of sperm, just like the others. Farmer, you just... Listen, we'll take all the boxes and get out of here. Farmer! You solved the case. The farmer. The farmer solved the case. You're good. You're professional. A professional. What do you think when you fuck her? Are you scared of me? No! No, I'm not! Do you play with yourself? What, you? I hope I'm not disturbing you. Go ahead, keep stalking me. I scared you. You startled me. How did you find me? I didn't. I waited for you to come home. - Are you some nut, following me around? - I don't know. Do I have to be nuts to follow you? I'm serious. I'm a policeman. I was in my hotel room, and I was proud and content. Because I achieved something that no one thought me capable of. I was in high spirits. I wanted to share that. Nobody was around. And I kept thinking about you. Come on, fuck me, cop. Come on. Do me. I'm gonna do you. Fuck me. What are you thinking? What is going through your head now? Nasty slut! - I'll fuck you till you burst! - I'll fuck you till you burst! - I'll fuck you till you burst! - You nasty slut! Stick it in my ass. What happened to your hand? Nothing. The suit's a bit much. It was on sale. Is it over now? Is the case solved? Yes. Yes. I'm so proud of you. - I'll take care of the harvest right away. - There's something else to tend to. That's Harro. Or what's left of him. Go upstairs. You should try checking the tracks. - It wouldn't be the first dog to attack a train. - He was on a leash. Someone cut him loose. I said I had nothing to do with it. He was hit by the train. I found him like that. I just wanted to help. Remember what I told you about evil? About the evil things people do? It starts out as something small. Exactly. Maybe just a lie. You might feel bad about it. But you get used to it. Why not steal, if you've lied? Why not burgle if you've stolen? Why not kill if you've burgled? Why not murder, rape and pillage? Why not kidnap 14 innocent kids, torture them, inflict suffering on them and their families... I wanted to help! Don't you believe me? Yes, my son. I believe you. It's so harmless at first. How long was the drive? Four and a half hours. Is there more? From the kitchen. Fresh? It's about the underwear. - Yes. - The test results. It's Gabriel Engel's sperm. That's sure. He also jerked off in Lucia's underwear. - And? - The problem is, he wasn't the only one. - What's that supposed to mean? - It means that Lucia's underwear has sperm from someone else as well. But she was only 12! - Exactly. - The way it looks, Engel could've gotten the object in question after the crime. - How can that be? - Coincidence. Or a fan sent him the box. Lucia never really fit his victim profile anyway. - Maybe he had a partner? - It's possible, but not likely. Engel is the typical loner. It was someone from here. - There's no need to get hysterical. - Nonsense. Nonsense! Who could it have been? Who? Show me who's capable. Look them in the face, your neighbors, relatives, friends, and show me who could kill a child! I'll vouch for every person here, even for you! If one of us is the murderer, he'll burn in hell. Since this happened, doubt hangs over us like a thundercloud. How much better could we sleep, if we'd prove that it wasn't anybody from here. This doubt is like a beast that gnaws its way into our guts. For you, maybe. But not for me. This meeting is over. Anyone who wants to prove his innocence can come by. Anyone. Hey, farmer! What does the village council say? I'm not sure if they'll come. They'll come. The innocent always do. Let them talk to their wives first. - And whoever doesn't, is our man? - He's at least a suspect. How long will you play this game? You're here for a long time. By not cooperating you're just making it hard on yourself. If you're waiting for your boyfriend... I know you have a thing for that village cop. If I were gay, I might like him, too. But don't get your hopes up, you won't be seeing him again. What do you two earn? You don't really think I'll answer that. And what about you? Oh, I forgot, it's not very German to talk about money. Why did you decide to talk at all? Who says I'm talking? I can hear you. You might hear the words I'm saying, but you don't understand them. - I'm doing okay. - You don't understand them, because they're not meant for you. Not? Then? For him? Are you talking to him? Maybe. But probably not. I doubt such a loyal warden is interested in a deal with a pervert like me. You're damn right. I have three kids. And do you fuck them? You sick pig! What kind of deal? That was it? Was that it? You have more to say. You do! You want to show me... You want to show me what a genius you are. - Is he here for the test? - Sure. You've mobilized the entire town. With him, we have all of Herzbach's male inhabitants. Except for one. - Sucharzewski. - That figures. And you, of course. Let's do it, then. Hey, that was a joke. You're not a suspect. Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned. - Speak, my son. - I was vain. I neglected my family to pursue my own gains. I had impure thoughts. Perverse thoughts. I cheated on my wife. In spirit or in the flesh? - In the flesh. - With whom? A city woman. And there's a man, an open ally of Satan. I was indecent with my wife. I'm infected with evil. Evil cannot enter a heart that's open to Christ. What about the dark, primeval desires, from when man was still a beast? Man was never a beast. He was created in God's likeness. - Then God must have a dark side. - That is blasphemous. Such are the thoughts in my head. They echo over and over, blurring the line between good and evil. - Everything is dissolving... - Were those all your sins, - my son? - Yes. ...full of grace... Ego te absolvo. Your sins are forgiven. - And my penance? - The Lord be with you... - Say 10 Our Fathers. - That's it? - This is justice? - The Lord be with you. - Is that it? - And five Hail Marys. Blessed art thou among women! Blessed is the fruit of thy womb. Pray for us poor sinners! Help me! Hello, farmer! Hello. - Yes, always working. - Hello, Seiler. - We got the test results. - So soon? We suddenly have highest lab priority. Thanks to you. What's the result? There's evidence of centuries of incest in your village. But back to the case. All negative. No match with the perpetrator's sperm. I'm running out of suspects. Sucharzewski. - It doesn't mean it was him. - He didn't take the test. I'll put him under surveillance, okay? I'm not talking to you. Unless you've found my dog. What is it? - Are you going to shoot me? - Why didn't you take the test? - I didn't feel like it. - You're the only one who didn't. - Everyone else is negative. - So what? I told you it's no one from here. I should've known. When you shot Schimanski. You're a sadist, a real cruel asshole! And you're an idiot. - You're going to take the test. - I am not. You've taken this far enough, boy. You'd do better to get out of my sight. Do you think anyone here gives a shit about you? Without me, you wouldn't even have a wife! But what have you made of your chances? You're a disgrace as a farmer, a husband and a father. Now you slander decent people. Nobody would've taken your test if it weren't for those city cops. You're a joke! A clown is what you are! You've been waiting for this, haven't you? This is your chance. Go ahead, Mr. Love-Your-Neighbor, Mr. Kind Policeman. Go ahead, shoot me. You perfect Catholic, always sitting in the front row. Right? You want to pull the trigger. Come on, I shot your dog. An eye for an eye. You! You slit her open and jerked off on her! You sick pig! No, he didn't. He can't. He's impotent. It's biological. I can show you the results. For how long? Thirteen years. I'm sorry. It's for you. Martens? - I hope you're doing well. - No. My investigation has hit a dead-end. Pack your things and wait outside. - I'm coming by helicopter to pick you up. - What happened? Gabriel Engel took poison. Will he die? In 48 hours. Here are files concerning the main cases that are tied to Engel. - We need confirmation of the crimes. - What if he admits to all of them? We've included some false leads, cases that have been solved already. - May I ask which ones? - No. - He's too crafty. - What does he want from me? We don't know. Does it matter? Heard about my time problem? Yes. - You wanted to see me? - No, you wanted to know something. - You're mistaken. - Stop, wait! I did want to see you. I had to kill myself to get my way. You succeeded. Here I am. Are they listening? Yes. No, they're not. How did you manage that? You know I have something that you don't want to share. No clue what you want from me, but if you don't get to the point, I'm through. But you do have a clue. A dark clue. They gave me this binder, full of murder cases. - Do you intend to comment on them? - No. That's what I thought. You're a smart fellow. So? Are you still so intent on being an upright citizen? A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things. And an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things - from an evil heart. - Well said. My evil treasure. I have an evil treasure that I'd like to bringeth forth to you. He's got to keep him talking. The poison might weaken his self-control, and he might confess. - Did you have an accomplice? - The whole world is my accomplice. - God is my accomplice! - Did God make you do it? Who do you think I am, Francis fucking Assisi? But if God created the world, he created me, too. Right? - And I'm at the end of the food chain. - You'll burn in hell. Like Emperor Constantine, who murdered his son, his wife, his brother-in-law and his nephew? Yet you revere him as a saint. How did evil come into the world? God created it himself. Why did he put the apple in Paradise? Why? He knew how it would end. He knows everything. I'll tell you, - God is mocking us. - You killed innocent children! You! - Who says they were innocent? - All children are innocent. Really? The sons of Judas are Ger, Onan and Shelah. Ger was evil in the Lord's eyes. So he killed him. I was never innocent. And the kids who would jump me, tear out my hair, force me to take their dick in my mouth, they weren't innocent. - Don't tell me about your childhood! - How do you measure a bad childhood? Is there a Richter scale for one's fate? Nobody is tested beyond his ability! Nobody! Your test is still coming, Michael. I... I will test you. - I won't allow that. - Too late. Evil is a virus. It's highly contagious, and you're already infected. - I'm just going to go. - You can't. Time is running out. For what? For your test? What about the necklace? What necklace? You know which one I mean. The one with the crucifix. Why didn't anyone ask me about it? - What? Where are you going? - Far away from that cell. - You can't do that! - This is futile. What necklace, Michael? - You're staying. You have a job to do. - Yeah? Like what? Like finding out where he got the poison. How's that possible, in a high-security ward? You won't believe it. Christan got an A in math. Yeah? Michael? What's wrong with you? I was just worried. About the kids? Yes. Talk to me. No, I... I really can't. God damn it! I hope you went to bed. I guess not. - Where is he? - He collapsed. He's in the hospital ward. I didn't think you'd come back. From Lord of the Flies. Psychobabble. - Can I speak to him? - I don't know. I've made no progress on the poison. Farmer, you remember that red and grey book. The jerk-off wrote in it every day. I got it for him. Yeah. It's gone, without a trace. Smuggling in a few drops of poison is one thing, but how can a big red book disappear? Did you ever count the squares? Why? There are 15. - I was in your cell. - Really? Who's the extra square for? For nobody. It's a joke, meant to confuse you. You're lying. Look at me. I'm on my deathbed. And you've got to believe a dying person, don't you? Did you murder Lucia Flieder? No. But now I'll tell you who did. You're ready! Fine. But it doesn't mean I'll believe you. That doesn't matter. Last year, on my tour of blood, I decided to avoid the big venues and play the small, trendy clubs. The cities had gotten too risky for me. Three days earlier, a mob lynched a death-metal fan who they thought was the Crucifix Killer. I arrived in your village. What a narrow-minded Catholic dump! I decided to take a local boy. But I would've attracted attention, so I kept driving. Then I saw you. You were like the kid who always plays the cop in cops and robbers. You wouldn't have been a good robber. When you came to my cell, I remembered everything, it all came back. I knew I had to tell you the story. You noticed me. Am I right? So I kept driving. 80 kilometers further, I had a lot of fun with little Philip Z?llner. Before long, I returned to your village. Without showing myself, I stationed myself in a pretty clearing. I began my hunt, got to know my territory, found out where you live. What a perfect family! Two kids, a dog and a garden. And you'd married your mother! Of course I wanted to kill your son. I stalked him for three days. To school, to his friend's house, to their secret meeting places. Then my love became too much. Passion swelled up in me. I wanted to thrust into him. That evening, he brought Lucia along. I wanted to wait until she left. But then he showed her his dark world. He leant over the animal, put his hand into the wound. He took the blood and drank it. That boy was raw. He was raw and wild and cruel. I loved him. I loved him like my own flesh and blood. - Christan, my son. - You're lying. That's not how it was. The boy was fantastic. I couldn't kill him. He was wonderful. You're trying to torment me. That little slut Lucia started crying. She didn't understand us, Christan and me. She didn't understand our dark world. My son and you... You have nothing in common. Nothing! He had a knife with him. He freed the lamb with it. For her. She wanted him to. Then they washed off the blood in the lake, with no clothes on. Naked. And, as they say, "They knew each other." The scene that I was treated to! The moon, these two naked kids, touching each other as they got dressed. Wonderful! You killed her. You let my son go, then you killed her. No, Michael, no. It was so typical. Your son's dick in her hand startled her. She got scared. It's understandable, she was only 12. She started screaming for her mom. She wanted to tell her mom everything. - You are lying! - When he plunged the knife into her, it was only to shut her up. But then... - You're just trying to torment me! - ...he started to have fun. You're Satan! I'll kill you! I'll kill you! Farmer! Farmer. They all want to know what he said to you. - Is he dead? - No, he's still alive. At least for a few more hours. He almost turned you into a murderer. What did he tell you? What did you tell him? Too late. There's nothing you can do. I've destroyed him. - What did you tell him? - You're all sheep. Sheep. Where's your book? Where is it? That's my evil treasure. My evil treasure! Come on! - He didn't say anything? - No, only insults and curses. - Why did you try to kill Engel? - Did I? Are you saying you can't remember? No, I... I mean, yes, I... I can't remember what transpired in that room. Except that he wanted to torment me. And? - He's bluffing, isn't he? - It's hard to say. Why should he bluff? - Maybe Martens knows the perpetrator. - That could be what he's covering up. Never! That's absurd. - Did he take the test? - Of course not. He wanted to, but... Now he will. Have a nurse take a blood sample. You're not a crazy murderer, are you? No. What about the necklace, the one Engel mentioned? No idea. You restored my belief in the good. If you turn out to be a sick jerk-off, then the world really is fucked up. - Thanks. - Don't mention it. It's your son's birthday. What do you think? Remember to be back in two days. I can keep quiet until then, okay? - I need to ask you a favor. - Consider it done. What is it? Do you still have priority in the lab? - Hi, Dad! - Hello, angel. - Happy birthday. - Thanks. There you are. Hurry or we'll be late. - Why did you let me sleep? - After all you've been through! Do we have to go to church today? - Especially today. - We'll celebrate afterwards. You can look forward to it. Isn't this a wonderful day? Chief Commissioner Seiler? It's me, Schmidtzen. Oh, yeah, I was trying to get in touch with you. That's a clear case of attempted bribery. Why didn't you report it earlier? We weren't alone. I didn't take it seriously. Besides, we were being recorded. I thought it'd be in the transcript. I read the transcripts. There's nothing in it. - Don't you believe me? - Yes, I believe you. Shit. That can't be. Then God looked for Abraham and said unto him, "Abraham!" And he said, "Behold, here I am." And he said, "Take Isaac, your only son, who you love, "and go to the Land of Moriah, and you shall sacrifice him "as a burnt offering on a mountain that I will name." - Look, Dad, it's just as good as yours. - Even better. - That's great. - Where's your dad's present? He'll get it later. Hold on, I'll get it. Bring out some more drinks. Yes? Okay, obvious things first. It's not you. Your test is negative. But the other sample... 99.9%. It's just incredible! Now just tell me you know whose it is. It's nothing new. Oh, that boy was raw. The holy trinity of serial killers, playing with fire, tormenting animals, bedwetting. Christan wet his bed again. - Where did you get the sample? - What necklace? What is he talking about? - Where did you get it? - Then he started to have fun. Who is it? I don't know. What? The sample is from Engel's apartment. No idea who it is. You have to explain that. - Tomorrow. - What? It's my son's birthday. I'll call you tomorrow. - It was for me. - Can I have your present now? Of course. Take your pick. Really? Wow! - I'll take that one. Is that okay? - It's yours. - Does this mean I can hunt with you? - Yes. Tomorrow morning. What is it? Shouldn't we answer? We're celebrating your birthday. - Seiler? Why didn't you call? - I did, but no one answered. Can I come in? It's urgent. Okay, what do you want? Hi, asshole. Happy to see me? Such an expensive hobby, all of a sudden? How can you afford it? I won the lottery. That uses a lot of electricity. May I? Sure. Schmidtzen talked about a nice little bribery attempt, which doesn't appear in the records. Can you help me out? No... Sometimes, if it's too vague... Or when the faucet's on... Could be anything... I'm usually very patient, but today I have no time for this. You supplied Engel with the poison! What else did he want? He offered me 50 grand to smuggle out his memoirs. - That's a lot of money for me. - Where's the book now? Bosowski. - Already dead. We just had a look at him. - Do you know a judge with insomnia? I need a search warrant for a publishing house. I'll see what I can do. But one other thing. Engel mutilated himself just before he died. - Mutilated? - He bit off a finger tip, and drew 17 squares in blood on his pillowcase. - 17? - Yes. Any idea what that means? 17 victims. No idea who he means. "Abraham rose early in the morning, "and saddled his donkey, "took with him his son Isaac "and cut wood for the burnt offering, "and went to the place of which God had told him." "The Memoirs of the Dark Angel." The world cannot hate you, but it hates me, for I am proof that it leads to evil. My work is now over. An innocent soul seldom ends up in these dark realms. And an existence without a cause is no existence at all. Last year, on my tour of blood, I decided to avoid the big venues and play the small, trendy clubs. So you don't forget me. - But you can't tell anyone. - Don't be silly. - I won't. - Then look away. I want to see it come out. I don't know if it'll work. - There, now we're even. - You've no hair! Just do it. Is it coming yet? How long does it take? - Yuck! It looks funny. - Christan! Go and hide. Christan! Are you in there? Come on, it's late. Go on! Nothing will happen to you. Engel tricked him! That dirty bastard! What a disaster. Seventeen squares. Three more victims. Lucia, Christan and Michael. Come on, Michael, don't make a mistake! Abraham lifted his eyes, saw the place from afar, and spoke to his young men, "I and the lad will go yonder. "And after we worship, we will come again to you."' Is it because of Harro? I didn't cut him loose. How do you manage to look so innocent? Dad, you're acting strange. How did evil come about? - It started as something small. - Exactly. It was still small. We should've nipped it in the bud! We never should've tolerated evil. - I don't really feel like hunting... - We're going to hunt. Go down. Why? Do what I tell you. Go down and... Over there... If you see an animal, drive it my way. I thought I could shoot today. You can. Now go. And Isaac spoke, "Behold the fire and the wood. "But where is the lamb for the burnt offering?" And stay clearly visible. Hunting accidents can always happen. Abraham answered, "My son, God will provide "a lamb for the burnt offering." Dad. It's you. Last year, the night Lucia Flieder died... Were you there with her? I... Dad, I wanted to tell you. But I was so ashamed. I thought nobody'd understand. It's all right. I understand. No lies. No hunting accident. Everyone should know. Everyone. And the Angel of the Lord called unto him, "Abraham!" Here I am. Here I am. Here I am! And the Angel of the Lord again called to Abraham and said, "I have sworn by myself," says the Lord, "Because you have done this, and have not withheld your only son, "that I will bless and multiply your seed, "like the stars of the heavens and the sand on the seashore. "Your seed shall possess the gate of his enemies. "In your seed will all the nations of the Earth be blessed."
