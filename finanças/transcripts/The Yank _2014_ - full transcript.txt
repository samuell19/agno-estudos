NICE TO MEET YOU. CHARMED. DID YOU SAY TIMBER LEG? YEAH, WE WERE GONNA CALL HIM TONY INSTEAD OF ANTHONY BUT HE HAD HIS TOES AMPUTATED, SO HE COULD STAND CLOSER TO THE BAR. PLUS, CALLING HIM TONY IS VERY, UH... ITALIAN, AND THERE'S NOTHING ITALIAN IN THIS HOUSE BUT YOUR MOTHER'S FAMOUS HOMEMADE SPAGHETTI SAUCE. SO GLAD YOU COULD COME. ANNIE, COME MEET THE GREEK GIRL. THANKS FOR HAVING ME. IT'S SO INTERESTING TO BE AROUND A FAMILY SO FOND OF THE PAST. OH-HO, I COULD TELL YOU A STORY. I GOT A SCAR HERE, I WAS STANDING AT A ROULETTE TABLE IN THE HOLY ROSARY CHURCH DURING THE FEAST OF ASSUMPTION. IT WAS 1973... SAY HELLO. UH, VANESSA, THIS IS MY MOTHER ANNIE. HI, PLEASURE TO MEET YOU. WELCOME TO OUR HOME. YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'RE GREEK. I'M A HUNDRED PERCENT. ACTUALLY MY PARENTS ARE FROM A LITTLE VILLAGE CALLED PALEOPANAGIA, RIGHT OUTSIDE OF SPARTA, GREECE. THAT IS SO CUTE. YEAH, I LOVE IT, I LOVE BEING GREEK. AND YOU'RE IRISH. ONE HUNDRED PERCENT. THAT'S SO CUTE. IS IT? WOULD YOU LIKE SOME MEATBALLS AND SODA BREAD? UH... OH, I AM SO SORRY. I DON'T HAVE ANY CUCUMBER SAUCE. OH, YOU MEAN TZATZIKI SAUCE. UH, EXCUSE ME, EVERYBODY, MY MOM NEEDS SOME HELP IN THE BACK MAKING SOME ICE CUBES. UH, STEVEN, COULD YOU GET EVERYONE SOME DRINKS? I DO LOVE YOUR ARCHITECTURE. ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET THE BRIDE-TO-BE A DRINK, HUH? MOM, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? THAT'S MARTY AND BERNIE'S FRIEND! I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT, BUT PROMISE ME, THOMAS, YOU WILL NOT GET INVOLVED WITH A GREEK GIRL. I PROMISE, THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN. I'LL TELL YOU ONE THING... IF YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS OF THAT, JUST REMEMBER, A GREEK GIRL'S LOYALTY IS TO HER FATHER, AND MAKING SURE EVERYBODY SEATED HAS MENUS AND IS FAMILIAR WITH TODAY'S SPECIALS. WE DON'T KNOW IF SHE'S LIKE THAT. MARK MY WORDS, YOU'LL FIND OUT. FIVE-FOUR-THREE-TWO-ONE... YAY! WELL, IRELAND WON AGAIN. I HAVE TO GET GOING. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR HOSPITALITY. OH, WELL, YOU'RE QUITE WELCOME. I HAD A REALLY NICE TIME. I'M GLAD. THANKS. 'BYE! I GUESS MY MOM WAS RIGHT ABOUT GREEK GIRLS AND THEIR FATHERS. WELL, I GUESS IT'S THE SAME WITH IRISH BOYS AND THEIR MOTHERS. WHOO-WHOO-WHOO! WHO WANTS TO SEE THIS ONE MORE TIME? I SWEAR TO GOD, PETER, HE IS GONNA MAKE ME GO GRAY BEFORE MY TIME. NO, NO, NO, ALL IN ALL, IT WAS A NICE EVENING. DID I NOTICE A LITTLE FRICTION BETWEEN YOU AND VANESSA? ABSOLUTELY, ARE YOU KIDDING ME? I THINK SHE INSULTED ME! ABSOLUTELY! SHE DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH MY SODA BREAD AND MY MEATBALLS. AND I AM A VERY GOOD COOK! MY MOTHER TAUGHT ME. HERE'S THE PROBLEM WITH TOM. HE'S THINKING WORLDWIDE. WE'VE GOT TO GET HIM FOCUSED ON IRELAND. AND THIS IS NOT HELPING. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? THIS IS ITALIAN FOOD. FROM NOW ON, NO FOREIGN FOODS IN THIS KITCHEN UNTIL HE LEAVES. AND I WANNA STRESS IRISH CULTURE. I'M GONNA TAKE HIM OUT ON A LITTLE WALK TO THE IRISH GARDENS. OH, THAT WOULD BE GOOD. I WISH I KNEW MORE IRISH HISTORY. BUT HE KNOWS LESS THAN I DO. WATCH YOUR STEP, SON. ALL RIGHT, DAD. I WANT YOU TO SEE THIS AMAZING PLACE. WOW, IT'S PRETTY. I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER BEEN HERE BEFORE. WELL, IT'S JUST BEEN REFURBISHED. BUT LET ME TELL YOU, EVERY NATIONALITY HAS A GARDEN ON THIS STREET. THIS ONE IS IRISH. IT'S VERY SPECIAL. IT'S A MONUMENT TO ALL THE GREAT IRISH POETS, PLAYWRIGHTS. CLEVELAND SETTLERS, WHO CAME ACROSS ON THE NINA, THE PINTA AND THE GOOD TIMES III. THAT'S RIGHT, THE GOOD TIMES III. GOOD TIMES I AND II WENT DOWN IN HEAVY SEAS. BUT THEY WENT DOWN HAVING FUN. LAKE ERIE'S TOUGH. ESPECIALLY THE CROSSING FROM TORONTO. SAMUEL BECKETT. HE WROTE WAITING FOR GODOT. IT'S CONSIDERED THE MODERN BIBLE FOR THE HUNTING OF FEMALE DEER. A CRUEL AND SENSELESS SPORT. THE VON TRAPP FAMILY SANG ABOUT IT. JAMES JOYCE WROTE ULYSSES, A DAY IN THE LIFE OF ULYSSES S. GRANT, THE GREAT GENERAL. WILL WE EVER SEE THE END OF WAR? HE WAS GOING TO BUILD A CASINO IN ATLANTA BEFORE SHERMAN BURNED THE PLACE DOWN. GEORGE BERNARD SHAW. HE WAS MUCH LAUDED FOR HIS WORK WITH PYGMIES. HE WAS REFERRED TO BY SOME AS THE JANE GOODALL OF DUBLIN. HE WAS A GOOD MAN. VERY GOOD, THEY WERE ALL GOOD FINE FOLK, BUT YOU DON'T HEAR A LOT ABOUT MANY OF THE FINE CLEVELAND IRISH FOLKS. SUCH AS, CHEF BOYLE O'DEE. THE CHEF WHO CREATED THE TECHNIQUE OF COOKING CALLED BOILING. HAVE YOU HEARD OF THAT? OH, I SURE HAVE. YOU SHOULD. IT HELPED MICHAEL SYMON BECOME IRON CHEF. AND PADDY "PAINT STROKES" MCGINTY. HE PAINTED THE FIRST SIGN THAT READ: IRISH NO NEED APPLY. HE WAS GOOD WITH A PAINT BRUSH. NOT TOO GOOD WITH STRUCTURING A SENTENCE. DO YOU KNOW WHAT ALL THESE FINE FOLK HAVE IN COMMON? THEY'RE ALL DEAD? WELL, UH, LET'S HOPE SO. BUT MORE IMPORTANT, THEY ALL HAD A GOOD, STRONG WOMAN AT THEIR SIDE. ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, DAD, I GET IT. EXCEPT OSCAR WILDE. HE INVENTED THE HOT DOG. I DON'T THINK HE WAS EVEN IRISH. LET'S TAKE A WANDER OVER TO THE WISHING WELL. I WANT YOU TO MAKE A WISH HERE, SON. DO YOU HAVE A COIN? I THINK I DO. GOT A LUCKY PENNY, DAD. OH, A PENNY, CAN'T BE TOO LUCKY. I WANT YOU TO TOSS IT IN AND MAKE A WISH. WISH THAT YOU FIND A NICE, STRONG IRISH WOMAN WHO'LL STAND BEHIND YOU, ESPECIALLY AFTER YOU'VE BEEN DRINKING. GIVE IT A PITCH. NOW LET'S GO GET SOMETHING TO EAT. YOUR MOM'S BOILING A TURKEY. YUM. WHILE I WAS GETTING MY PASSPORT, DAD DECIDED TO JOIN THE FELLOWS FOR SOME AUTHENTIC IRISH CORNED BEEF. THIS IS IRISH CORNED BEEF? HE HAD TO DO SOMETHING TO GET THE TASTE OF BOILED TURKEY OUT OF HIS MOUTH. YOUR FIRST TIME GOING OVERSEAS. FIRST TIME ACROSS THE ATLANTIC, MR. MURPHY. IT TOOK ME 30 DAYS JUST TO GET MY PASSPORT APPROVED, SO I'M WORRIED ABOUT THE PROCEDURES ONCE WE FLY OUT OF NEW YORK TO CROSS THE ATLANTIC. WHAT PROCEDURES IS THAT? YOU JUST GET ON A PLANE AND YOU SIT. WELL, NOT ANYMORE. YOU GO THROUGH CUSTOMS, THEN THEY HAVE THIS THING WHERE YOU STAND STRAIGHT WITH YOUR HANDS UP, AND THEN A SCANNER GOES IN FRONT OF YOU, ALL THE WAY AROUND. THEY SEE YOUR NAUGHTY BITS THROUGH THERE. IS THAT WHAT'S HAPPENING? AND YOU CAN GET A PHOTO OF IT BACK, YOU KNOW, AN EIGHT-BY-TEN, IF YOU WANT IT. YOU CAN HANG IT ON YOUR WALL. THEY SPEAK UH... ENGLISH THERE, DON'T THEY? AND GAELIC, MR. MURPHY, GAELIC. DO YOU UNDERSTAND GAELIC? A LITTLE BIT. I'VE BEEN RESEARCHING IT FOR THIS TRIP. I'LL THROW SOME ON YOU, YOU TELL ME WHAT IT MEANS. ALL RIGHT. YOU SOUND A LITTLE GERMAN THERE. I'M STARTING TO SLIP. I DIDN'T HEAR ANY ACHTUNG IN THERE. ACHTUNG! DID IT GO WELL AT THE CULTURAL GARDENS WITH TOMMY? I THINK I MADE SOME BIG HEADWAY THERE. HE SEEMED QUITE IMPRESSED. YOU KNOW, I'M A LITTLE FLIMSY ON MY IRISH HISTORY. BUT I PULLED THINGS FROM, I DON'T KNOW WHERE. AND IT'S A BEAUTIFUL SPOT. HAVE ANY OF YOU BEEN THERE? THEY GOT JAMES JOYCE. NOW I'M NOT SURE IF THEY WERE BORN HERE IN CLEVELAND OR NOT, BUT THEY GOT THE BEAUTIFUL MARKERS THERE, AND WHEN I FIRST GOT THERE I THOUGHT, GOOD LORD, ARE THESE PEOPLE BURIED HERE? BUT I DON'T THINK THEY ARE. I DON'T KNOW IF ANYONE IS BURIED THERE. YOU KNOW AT YANKEE STADIUM, THE MEMORIAL GARDEN? OH, SURE. I, AS A KID, I THOUGHT LOU GEHRIG AND BABE RUTH WERE BURIED THERE. AND I SAID, THAT MUST BE A GREAT PLACE TO BE BURIED. OUT IN CENTERFIELD. NO, IT'D BE HARD TO REST THERE. THE RIVER LIFFEY PRETTY MUCH BISECTS THE CITY OF DUBLIN. CAN YOU SWIM IN THAT RIVER? WELL, PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO DO THAT. THERE'S AN OLD TRADITION WHERE YOU GET IN, IF YOU CAN SWIM TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BRIDGE NEAR TRINITY, YOU MIGHT HAVE A SHOT THAT SEMESTER. A LOT OF TRADITIONS ON THE CAMPUS AT THE UNIVERSITY. THE BOOK OF KELLS? THAT'S WHERE THE BOOK OF KELLS IS KEPT. WHAT IS YOUR LEAST-FAVORITE WORD? MY LEAST FAVORITE WORD IS UNFORTUNATELY. MY FAVORITE IS CONGRATULATIONS. ANOTHER LEAST-FAVORITE WORD IS DUCK! WHAT ARE THE THREE THINGS IF YOU HAD TO IMPART ON THIS SCHMUCK WHO'S ABOUT TO GO DOWN THE AISLE OVER IN IRELAND, WHAT ARE THE THREE THINGS HE HAS TO WALK AWAY WITH, HANDS DOWN? WELL, OUR MARRIAGE STARTED OFF TERRIFIC. THEN AS WE WERE LEAVING THE CHURCH, I GUESS I SAID THE WRONG THING. AND YOU KNOW SOMETHING ELSE YOU HAVE TO TAKE PHILOSOPHICALLY IN YOUR MARRIAGE... IF YOU WEREN'T MARRIED YOU WOULDN'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL YOU WERE DOING WRONG. THAT'S WHAT A GOOD WOMAN DOES, TO POINT OUT WHAT YOU DID WRONG. I USED TO BE A SNAPPY DRESSER, BUT NOW ALL I HEAR IS YOU'RE NOT GOING OUT IN THAT ARE YA? YOU LOOK GOOD TODAY. THANK YOU. SLÁINTE. SLÁINTE, SLÁINTE. THE WATER'S LO-CAL, TOO. YOU ALL PACKED, STEVEN?

ALSO, DID YOU KNOW IN IRELAND THEY DON'T USE MILES, THEY USE KILOMETERS. YOU NEED ME. YEAH. I'M A CONVERTER, HUMAN CONVERTER. I'M STILL GONNA DO MILES. ME, TOO. YOU HAVE TO DO KILOMETERS. ALL RIGHT, BUDDY. COME ON, DON'T DO THIS. STEVE! LOOK AT HIM! STEVEN, YOU'RE GONNA WET YOUR PANTS AGAIN. YEAH. THAT'S BAD, THAT'S NOT GOOD. YOU'VE GOT A LONG FLIGHT. I DON'T THINK I CAN GO, YOU GUYS. DON'T FREAK OUT. IT'S TOO MUCH. I'VE NEVER BEEN OUT OF OHIO. HEY, COME ON, COME ON, COME ON, COME ON, WHAT ARE YOU... WE WERE GONNA GO TO MICHIGAN FOR A TRIP. BUT I HAD TO GET SOME VACCINATIONS, AND EVERYTHING FELL APART. HOW 'BOUT YOURSELF, YOU ALL PACKED? YEAH, ALL PACKED. HERE WE GO. OH, WHAT IS THAT? THIS IS MY LUGGAGE. YOUR WHAT?

DIRECT LINE TO THE OLD MAN. UH, RIGHT, THAT'S, I COULD PROBABLY USE THAT. AND I GOT A FOOTBALL FOR THE PLANE, TOSS THAT AROUND. THAT'LL BE FUN. I GOT THIS. I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT THAT. I'M READY FOR IRELAND, BOYS. LET'S HAVE A TOAST. ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT, I GOTTA GET GOING. I'M OFF TO THE AIRPORT. ALL RIGHT, SEE YA THERE. ALL RIGHT. WE'RE GOING TO IRELAND! WE'RE GOING TO, WE'RE GOING TO IRELAND! WE'RE NOT GONNA MAKE IT. WE'RE NOT, THERE'S NO WAY. THOMAS, TOMMY, I AM SO GLAD WE CAUGHT YOU. WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING HERE? SON, I AM PROUD OF YOU. WE BOTH ARE, AM I RIGHT, ANNIE? WAS THAT THE GREEK GIRL I SAW GETTING OFF THE SHUTTLE WITH YOU? SHE'S NOT WITH ME, HONESTLY. WE WERE ON THE SAME SHUTTLE BUS TOGETHER. YOU STEER CLEAR OF HER. SHE'S NO GOOD, TOM, NO GOOD, I TELL YOU. MOM, TAKE IT EASY. YOU SOUND LIKE BARBARA STANWYCK. WELL, I DON'T WANT HER TO SPOIL THIS CHANCE FOR YOU. WHAT CHANCE? TOM, WHAT YOUR MOTHER MEANS TO SAY IS, YOU'RE THE FIRST MURPHY SINCE MY GREAT GRANDFATHER WHO IMMIGRATED TO AMERICA IN THE 1880S... TO GO BACK TO IRELAND. IT'S YOUR ONLY CHANCE TO FIND A REAL IRISH GIRL. MAKE US PROUD. YOU'RE GONNA MEET A LOT OF LOVELY IRISH LASSES. SAVE ONE FOR ME. I MEAN, FOR BOTH OF US. UH, FOR CONVERSATION.

YOU KNOW YOU GET COCKY. I'M NOT GETTING COCKY, I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU. I MEAN, FIRST I'M A PIECE OF BLACK PUDDING AND NOW YOU'RE CLARENCE FROM IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE? WHY DO YOU CARE?

WE HAVE TO GET A GOOD JOB, WE HAVE TO MAKE OUR FAMILIES HAPPY. WE HAVE TO LOVE SOMEONE THAT THEY WANT US TO LOVE. THEN SOMETHING CHANGED THAT.

BROWN BREAD, HIGH IN FIBER, OKAY... TEA, COULD PROBABLY USE SOME WHISKEY BUT IT'S A LITTLE EARLY. WHAT DO YOU WANT? NOTHING. I WAS ON THE BEACH LAST NIGHT, SPANISH POINT BEACH. IRISH MOLLY, SHE KISSED ME. I WARNED YOU ABOUT THAT GIRL. I KNOW, I KNOW. BUT YOU REMEMBER THE TALK WE HAD YESTERDAY, ABOUT FINDING THE PERFECT ONE? I KNEW INSTANTLY IT'S NOT HER. IT'S SOMEBODY ELSE. WELL, GOOD FOR YOU. YEAH! AND THEN SHE JUST WALKED AWAY. SHE PROBABLY RAN HOME AND TOLD HER BIG BROTHER. OH, CRAP! YOU PUT BOTH FEET IN THE WOOD CHIPPER THIS TIME, DIDN'T YOU?

SPEAKING OF WHICH... HAS TOM FOUND HIS YET? NO. NO, I THINK HE'S A BIT CONFLICTED. WHY? WHAT'S THE CONFLICT? WELL, IT SEEMS HE FANCIES A LOVELY AMERICAN GIRL, BUT HIS FAMILY IN AMERICA WANT HIM TO MARRY AN IRISH-BORN GIRL. VERY BACKWARD LIKE THAT, THESE AMERICAN COUSINS OF MINE. MMM, NO MORE THAN YOUR OWN FAMILY WANTING YOU TO MARRY THAT GIRL YOU GOT PREGNANT. WHAT DO YOU WANT TO BRING THAT UP FOR? HAVE YOU BEEN AT THE COMMUNION WINE AGAIN? SHEESH... ANYWAY, SHE WASN'T PREGNANT. IT WAS ENTRAPMENT. LUCKILY I HAD ME SENSES ABOUT ME. OH, THAT'S RIGHT. BEGGING YOUR MOTHER FOR FORGIVENESS. WELL, I HAD TO, DIDN'T I? I MEAN, SHE IS ME MA. DIDN'T WANT TO BREAK HER HEART. THAT WOULD BE A SIN. THEN I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO COME TO MASS WITH YOU AND HAVE A PINT AFTERWARDS, WOULD I? COME ON. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
