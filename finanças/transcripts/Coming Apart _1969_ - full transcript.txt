Hello? Hello? Hello? Testing, one, two, three, four. Hello? Testing, one, two, three, four. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Testing. Testing. I am frightened and wonder to find myself here. I am frightened... I am frightened and wonder to find myself here rather than there, for there is no reason why I should be here rather than there now rather than then. Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Here. Be more comfortable. That better? Yeah. Tell me what you felt. What was it like? Like the burning of the Hindenburg. Be serious, Joe. How was it? When you do that to me... Great, baby. It's like a long trip into oblivion. That's the way it is when you do it to me, Joe. Next time, Joy. Huh, babe? Oh, I... I didn't mean... They could support the kid. What's the matter, Joe? What... what are they? I just told you. Will you tell me again? Cigarette burns... Cigarette burns. Is that really so strange? Haven't you ever done that to your girlfriend? Have you ever seen it before? I mean, with all the girls you must meet. Where'd you get them? I mean, who... who did it? A man I went with. I stopped seeing him a couple of months ago. He's kind of famous. If I mentioned his name, I'm sure you'd recognize it. Actually, you're... You're very much like him, that's probably why I find you so attractive. Why is this, uh, the triangular pattern, huh? Why didn't he burn your breasts? I didn't want him to. I... I was afraid of cancer or something. I don't know. No, thank you. Would you like to do it? Do you mean burn you? Mm-hm. Sure, why not? What do you mean "sure"? Well, I mean okay, if you want me to, I will. Well, do you want to? Well, not especially. I mean, if... if you want me to, I will, I don't mind doing it. Be very interested. But do you really want to? Well, I don't think it'd give me any particular pleasure. I mean, I don't care. I mean, I will. I, uh, I'm curious. No, no, if you, uh, don't really want to, if it... If it wouldn't give you a great deal of pleasure, it wouldn't be any good. Oh, listen, do anything you want to me. Just do anything you want, anything. Well, like what? Everything, baby, just anything. Anything you want. Yeah, well, what? Anything. Well, I mean, there's only three or four things we can do, right? Look, I... I... I could talk to someone on the phone while... while you were doing it to me. - About what? - Oh, any... anything you want. I could... I could tell her how it is. Is there anything else we could do? Anything, anything, anything you can think of. Uh... You know, I knew this girl who told me about there was a guy that used to pay her to, uh, well, he... he put a duck in a top drawer of a dresser and, uh, with just the head out. And then he put his, you know, in the mouth of the duck. And then the chick closed the dresser and, uh, the duck clucked with his beak on the guy's, you know? That's how he got his kicks. Would you like to do that? Hm? - Where would you get a duck? - Oh, I don't know, I'm sure we could find one some place. I don't even have a dresser. Well, I... I have one, we can go to my place. Oh, not today, my daughter will be home from school soon. You got a daughter? How old is she? Seven. Listen, I have a friend, she might have a dresser. No, listen, forget that, I was just kidding, okay? Uh, how 'bout your boyfriend, what does he like? Oh, he liked me to wear different things. Like what? Like, um, bras and garter belts and slips and stiletto heels, - you know, that kind of thing. - Okay, this sounds interesting. I guess we could do that, couldn't we? Yes, I can go to my apartment, I can get anything you want. Okay, I tell you, you go get some of that stuff and bring it up here and I'll pick out what I like. Like... like what? What should I get? Hm? Oh, you know. Mm. Anything. - Boots? - Mm, boots, boots. - Okay, okay. - And those, uh, stiletto things. Okay, okay. I'll be... I'll... I'll be right back. You like it? Hm? Yeah. That's nice. What you got in your hand? Oh, these shoes? Yeah. They're not, uh, they're too high to walk on, so, shall I put 'em on? Yeah, put "em on. Okay. You mean you can't walk in those? They're not for walking. They're for, uh, special occasions. Hey, you... you read the autobiography of Malcolm X? -Mm-hm, -Yeah, well, there's a... He talks about at dances all the bad cats would bring, uh, their sneakers to the dance in a paper bag. And then around midnight they'd go over to the dance and get really heavy. They'd take off the shoes and put on the sneakers. So, this is the, uh, stiletto heel. Mm-hm. You like it? Well, uh, are there any longer than that? How could they be longer? I mean, I can't really see much difference between them and the normal heel. No, I mean, uh, I don't see how they could arouse anyone. Oh, but they do. - Huh? - They aroused him. Don't you like 'em? Yeah, baby, I like 'em. I mean, I like the other ones too, I liked 'em just as well. I mean, I like, uh... I like to see you wobble when you walk. Listen, I'll... I'll put on something else. Just tell me. I can tell you're disappointed, aren't you? Huh? I'm not disappointed. Oh. Oh, now, baby. Now. Just... just... Oh, do it to me now. Would you help me with this? Huh? I, uh... Can we get rid of some of this stuff here. Yeah, just tell me what. What? Well, the stockings and the, uh, garter. Oh, sure, sure, darling. Sure, Honey, don't put your shoe on the sofa, please. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm... I'm sorry. I'm sorry, darling, I... I... Oh, you're raping me. Oh, you're raping me. You're raping me, you're raping me. Oh, hurt me, hurt me, hurt me please. Please hurt me. - Oh, any way. - Yeah, but how? - Please, please! - Dammit, I don't know what the hell I'm supposed to do! What do you want me to do? What do you want me to suck your tits as hard as I... What do you want me to kill you? Anything, anything, anything you want, baby. Tell me how, what. Slap my face, go on, slap me, slap me. Slap me, slap me, slap me! Oh, slap me! Slap me! Slap me! Slap me! Slap me! Burn me! I've said it, I've really said it. I feel good, I feel great. I know! Why won't you stop saying that? Yeah. Hi, are you Mr. Glassman? Yes. Oh, well, my name is Anita Spitzer and I live in the building now. - Uh-huh. - I'm a friend of Elaine's. Well, she told me you were a photographer. - She did? - Yeah. That's right. Well, if you have some time, I'd like you to look at my portfolio. - Are you a model? - Well, yes. I mean, I haven't done any photography for a while, but I'm trying to get back into it and... But if I'm interrupting anything... No, come in. - Are you sure? - Mm-hm. Uh, shall I leave this here? No, bring it. Excuse me. Gee, I hope I'm not interrupting anything. No. Um, I'm not sure I can do anything for you, but I'd certainly like to see your portfolio. - Come sit. - Okay, sure. Working? Listen, would you like a drink? No, no, thank you. Well, I'm gonna freshen mine up. Would you want one? Okay, what do you have? Well, uh, I got scotch and, uh... Water? Okay. What's that modeling that you do? Oh, I'm a... a color test model. A what? A color test model. What's that? Oh, well, on color television the colors keep losing their balance and they have to be reset. So, um, I have perfect skin. I sit in for Walter Cronkite. You have perfect skin and you sit in for Walter Cronkite? Right, so they balance the colors on me and then Walter comes in. How long you been doing that? For ages it seems, but I guess, oh, eight months. But I don't like it. That's why I want to get back into photography. Well, I'm not that kind of photographer, but I'd like to look at these pictures. Oh, what do you mean "that kind of photographer"? I mean, you haven't even looked at them yet. I, uh... I don't take pictures of models in set positions. I, uh, like to photograph things as they happen. I'm interested in reality. Oh, I see what you mean. Oh, that's a little modeling thing I did. I don't like that, I'm taking that out. I like it. I don't like it. Well, why do you do this, uh, why do you work? I mean, who takes care of your baby? Oh, well, my husband, he is in jail. - Yeah? - Mm-hm. What's he in for? I don't like to tell people. Sorry. What? It's nothing personal. Doesn't make it very easy for me. I have to leave the baby with my mother in Queens or... or Elaine, our neighbor, a sitter, or maybe even you some time. No, no. You know, you have a nice place here. You paint? No, that's... a friend did that. I hope he doesn't want to be an artist. Ahhh. - Oh, I'm terrible. - Oh, you paint. You got paint all over these pictures. - What is it? - Oh, it's oil paints. Actually, I'm pretty good. I just did a really good one. I don't like this either, do you? Oh, who's this? That's an old pal. - An old pal? - Yeah, met him in the flea market in Paris. You like him? Well, I don't think he likes me. Uh-huh. A little uptight. What's this? A kinetic art object. A what? A modern sculptury. Oh. Hm. You know, actually, I'm looking for someone to... To share an apartment with. Um, well, I mean, I can cook and, uh, you know, clean up and I'm a lot of fun to be with. - Yeah? - Mm. I'm a little blind. A little blind? - Hey, uh... - Yeah? Could I ask you something? Are these breasts really you? Are they real? What? Well, come here. Are these really your nipples? Well, last time I looked. I mean, the dark part of it covers the whole front part of your breasts. They're a very nice composition. - Yeah. - I mean, good photographer. Oh yeah, I can't remember what his name is, but, uh, - he was really good. - Yeah, there's... The way they got the guitar and the ceramics and the way... The shape of your... I never saw... it covers the whole front part of your breasts. The whole... It's real. Well, would you like to see them? I mean, I mean, it's okay because, like, if you were taking pictures of me you would see them, wouldn't you? Well, I, uh... Maybe I better not. I mean, uh... You're very handsome. Sorry. Why did you say that? Did you sleep with Elaine? No. I'll bet. Hey. All right, I'll show you my bosom, uh, but no kidding around, okay? Promise? Cross your heart? Well? What do you think? Are they, uh, made up? - They are real. - They are real, honey, you know it. All mine. Hey, why don't you put on some music? Do you like to dance? Ooh, boy. Well, stop sharing. Oh, that's good. You know, I was actually working for one those, um, topless places, you know? Why don't you take off your skirt? Oh no. Okay, but only if I can trust you. I mean, really promise? Okay. Hey! No, no. Uh, what's this? It's an automatic timer. Oh, so you don't keep it in too long? Well, it automatically turns appliances off and on. Ooh, that sounds exciting. Can I kiss you? All right, but nothing more. No. No! No. No! No! Nol. Is it worth $50 to you? What's the matter? Don't you think I'm worth it? I think you're worth $10,000. Uh-uh, no, no. No! No! Stop! I never did anything like this before in front of my baby. How old is your baby? Seven weeks. Two months. So young. I mean, you must be mad to do a thing like this. I mean, you're supposed to be a doctor. What do you want me to do, move out of here now? God, how could I ever get mixed up in a thing like you? Who would think of such a thing? - You only you! - Now, look here. This apartment belongs to a friend of mine. I borrowed it from him to work here. I do not live here. I live with my wife at home. How can somebody let you move into an apartment - that he's never even been in? - I found this place for him. Oh, yes, of course, and he has exactly your taste. You haven't seen me for over a year, that's all you have to say. You don't know about... About what? You don't know, you don't even care how well I've been doing. How would I know? Hm? I mean, how would I know? Everyone else knows it but you. What is they know? Tell me. That you're brilliant? I mean, everybody knows that you're brilliant. If you would ever straighten yourself out. Right. July's been terrible without you. I love you. I can't believe it, I just can't believe it. I don't tremble anymore when you're close to me. I love you. Darling. It's too late... It's too late. Why did you come to this place? Why did you have to come here, here to this building? I don't know. I feel less lonely here. I mean, it's just an incident that I happen to live here. Can't you accept that... That the relationship is over? Is it? Is it really? Yes, yes, it's over, you see, it's over. Would you like to try, um, to kiss me again? Come, kiss me again. - You love him? - Yes. Are you gonna marry him? Yes, I'm gonna marry him. Ah, shit. Ah, he's so fucking old. Don't talk about him like that! Don't you dare! I am so tired of your games. I want to be happy. I'm getting old. And I want to have children. I'll give you children. You... Well, really, Joe. Listen, why don't you believe it when I tell it to you? It's finished, it's over. Please, it's over. It's not the same anymore, see? Thank God it's not the same anymore. It's too late. It's just too... When do you get to decide on this? I love you. No, I said no, no! God, how could I ever have loved a man like you? Sorry, I don't get back at you. Find somebody else, hm? Your wife, she's a very nice girl... Oh, you, don't you say that to me. I'll ride on the elevator with... No, I don't need you. Thank you. Why don't you take off your coat? All right. Very happy to run into you. I'd forgotten, do you... you live around here? No. I was just running around taking pictures. You still have the same job. No. But I'm still a designer. You work for another architect? Yes. That sounds like an improvement. It is. Is today your day off? No. Okay, no more questions. - None of my business. - It's not fair. You can ask me about my life, I can't ask you about yours. Oh, that's an interesting problem, - isn't it, huh? - Mm. I was very sorry to see you leave. Why didn't you come back? Shouldn't tell you this, you'll be angry. Saw someone else for a while. Oh, angry? How'd it work out? I didn't like him. He's too square. Wasn't as hip as you. Can I come back now? I wish you could, uh... Actually, I'm... I'm cutting down on my practice. No, I wish you could. Uh... I wanna do some writing. I've been given a grant for a paper I did. Really? Can I read it? Mm, you don't read that stuff. Anyway, if I, uh, took you back as a patient I'd have to tell you to leave now. I don't wanna do that. Really? Why not? I feel like having company right now. What's happening with you? I mean, why aren't you working today? At this time of day. No, it's last night. Actually, when I woke up this morning, there was this guy. Well, I've never been to one before. Maybe I should. What's it like? It's... You know... In the whole group. Well... I mean, do you have the, uh, same partner all night? I mean, what do you do, you just screw? It's wild. It's wilder than you can imagine. Well, what did you do last night? I got so drunk I don't even know. I had, uh, seven, six. Some fat television producer was trying to, uh... You know, go down on me... ...all night. I wasn't interested in him. Wow. Why am I telling you all this for? You're not my doctor. I guess I trust you. If I don't trust you, who can I trust? I guess I'm just a whore at heart. I love to be called a whore. That's what Earl calls me. You still see him? I still live with him. We like... we just, you know... ...like sleeping together. I'm lonely too. You're the only one. You're the only one that was ever nice to me. I'd like to give you something. You're the only one. Only one that was... That was ever good to me. I wanna give you something. What's wrong with me? You're not supposed to do that to an analyst. I mean, you're not supposed to... Well, I hope somebody does. Yeah, I'm very tempted. Having... Having an affair with you would be fantastic. Yeah? You've got to go back to work and I have to go home to my wife. Wow. Mm-hm. You're married? Mm-hm. Wow. What? I'm glad you're married. I thought... I thought that you were a fag. Did you really? One thing though... I know I'm right about. What's that? You're a softie. - Oh yeah? - Uh-huh. Uh-huh. - All right. - Bye. - Dr. Mindich called. - Uh-huh. - Mr. Pell called. - Uh-huh. Ken Menenowitz. Please call back. Uh-huh. Mrs. Tenenbaum called. Uh-huh. We'll be in this evening. Okay. And your wife called twice. She said that it was nothing important. Oh, look, you better hold all those messages, okay? All right, Dr. Glazer. Goodbye. Is that why you're not working today? Yes, I'm really frightened, Dr. Glazer. What happened with Dr. Cohn? He said he didn't think he could help me. Why? Look, Mrs. Minkowski, call me in a few days. Uh, call me Tuesday morning, I'll have someone for you. Why can't I see you, Dr. Glazer? You really helped me. You really did. I was getting better. I can't see you, Mrs. Minkowski, I really can't. I've stopped seeing all of my afternoon patients and all my Monday patients. I don't believe you. You were my friend. Why don't you want to help me? If you think I would lie to you, Like this? No. No, it's not the same sound. I shouldn't tell you this, but Ted complains that I make too much noise when we make love. He says that I scream too loud and that the neighbors complain. You mind that? Joe? No, I don't mind. I mean, he's not very inspired. Sometimes I think he has homosexual tendencies. All right, all right, all right. I don't think anybody could be married to you and have... have homosexual tendencies. Oh? Well, what do you mean by that? Oh. You're really in torment, Joe. I'm... I'm really sorry for doing this to you. I really am. I wish I could do something to help you, but you are so hostile. You are. The minute someone reaches out to you to touch you, anything to show you love, you pull away. You get scared and you pull away and you get hostile, Joe. I mean, you must have had some mother, baby. You keep searching for your mother. You... you really need somebody, Joe. How do you know my own wife isn't the one? - Your wife? - Yeah. Well, I think that's obvious, and not just to me. But to everyone. It is? Hello. Would you like to support Senator McCarthy in his bid for the democratic nomination? Well, would you care to write to one of the convention delegates asking him to support McCarthy? - Like that? - We are just, um, wipe here in... What is so funny? Hey, listen, are you really Glassman? Yes, but, uh, disguised as a mild-mannered reporter. Don't worry, Glassman, we won't tell. You can trust us. You want me to pick out any name here and write a letter. Yeah. Hm. I think I'll write Theodore Sorensen. Dear Ted... Do you know him? No. But I think if we get his vote we'll get a few others. What's that? What's that? Now can I tell him how much I hated his book? No. What book? Well... Oh.. Did you read Kelvman's book? Uh-huh. Well, did you like it? It's a little better. Not much. Mm-hm. Lady, what's funny? Well, he's my father. I like the cover. I liked his other book. I like his column. Thank you. Will you let this down please? Mm-hm. Thank you. Look what he wrote. I summon you to your moral responsibility to these members of the new left. Hey, he's not Glassman, look at the signature. What, you don't expect me to reveal my identity to everybody, do you? I mean, how can I fight crime? Besides, as Glassman I'm expected to rise above political consideration. That's true. I'm sorry, Glassman. It's okay. Um, are you a professional writer? Maybe I should have been, but, no, I'm not. Uh, uh... Dear Miss Lonely Hearts, I am 16 years old now and I don't know what to do and would appreciate it if you could tell me what to do. You like Nathanael West? Yeah, well, I noticed that you had it over there. That's why I thought you were a writer. I'm a psychiatrist. Really? Say, maybe... Maybe you can help me. Uh, I think we better go now. I would invite you to stay for cookies and milk, but if the senator walks by when. - Bye. - Bye. Bye. Hope you win. Take off your coat. Want something to drink? Do you drink? Yes. So I guess you got caught in the big downpour? Yes. Wandering about all night, all day.. Ah... I guess you're gonna have to take off those things too. I've got a bathrobe. It's all right. I'll be fine. I guess you don't have much choice. You'll get a bathrobe and you can put it on in the bathroom. Hey. How you gonna behave yourself? Persevere in the presents. How old is Mary? Sixty-two. She was married when she was young. Well, who picks up her bill? Her union's medical plan. What does she do? She's a feather-paster. Huh? A feather-paster. She works for a milliner. Oh. She makes ladies' hats. Nah, John, I don't think that's for me. Why not? You have the time. I know, but your patients. You're kidding. What do you want, a young blonde? - Yeah. - So there. All right. I have a young girl, a high school teacher in her late 20s. - Would you be interested? - Yes. can't stand beneath their lies. I'd be happy to have a young girl. Okay. I'll send you the young girl if you agree to see the old woman. What kind of deal you making with me? Are you interested or not? I don't know. Why don't you send the old woman? 'Cause she's a patient of mine. I don't know, Jim. All right, think about it, will ya? Well, it's about time you pay some attention to me. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm glad you are here. Who was that lady? Who was that in the elevator? Uh-huh. Woman I know. Is that the woman you told me about? Yeah. How'd you know? How'd I know? My god, the two of you looked like you were gonna faint. Anyway, she had an accent. What'd you think of her? She's very hard looking. She's not nearly as attractive as you told me she was. - She's beautiful. - Wow. You're still in love. What'd you think of the guy she was with? You're with me now, remember? That's all right. I'm in love too. I miss Earl. You miss him? Where is he? He's in Brazil, you wanna go over his place? What for? I was just checking. She certainly isn't as beautiful as you. Yeah, well, I wish I could say the same thing. How are things in the bedroom? He is... his body is so much smoother, your skin is too tough. It is? He enjoys it more. You're both typical. Well? Let's make the best of a bad day, shall we? Uh-huh. I like technicians sometimes. Come here. Let me finish my drink first. -Oh, -Uh-huh. Oh. Where did you get the lovely tan? In St. Thomas? My boyfriend. He wants to go with me. Huh? I told you. He wasn't my boyfriend anyway. You are my boyfriend. Do it to me. Okay, now. You just stand there and face the mirror. Like this. Ohh! Oh wow. It's like an orgy. It looks like someone else, you're seeing yourself! Wow. Hey. Can we do it in front of the mirror? - You better believe it. - Shit, man. Hey, don't do that. Hey, put that down! Put it down! Don't get excited. Afraid I'm gonna blackmail you? Put that thing away. Coward. You... all right. Put it down! Dammit, put it down! I'm not taking any pictures, I'm looking at the camera. You're different than I thought. How's that? You really want me to tell you? Yeah. You're not as strong as I thought. What do you mean? Oh... Huh? You're... frightened. Frightened. You're weak-willed. There's no mystery about you. None. No. You're just gonna sit there? Ow! Fuck you! Don't do that to me! Get down on your hands and knees. Hello? Hello, how are you? For the past week, somehow, I just... I just expected you would call, even though you said you wouldn't, I... I guess I would like to see you again. Look. I can't talk now. There are some people here. Who's there? Joe, can I call you back? Well, I was just leaving for the weekend. If I don't see you soon, Joe, I think... I really think I'm gonna go out of my mind. I really don't know what to say. I can't talk now, you understand? I wish I could. I... I understand. I'm sorry for calling you. I'll talk to you soon, okay? All right. Bye. Dippy Doodle! Dippy Doodle! Hi, Dippy Doodle. Ah. Hi, Dippy Doodle. Hey. What are you, Springfield Sid? Hm, mushroom. No, I'm Mr. Blunder. I'm Mr. Blunder, dopey. You're a psychiatrist and you didn't even know that? That makes me sad! They feel sad. Sarabell, be kind. I wanna be Mr. Blunder. You wanna be Mr. Blunder. You want to be Mr. Blunder. Wait a minute.

I gotta get me some air. Easy. Don't disturb the Princess of Earth, Air, Fire, Sodie Water. - Wait, wait. - He's got fifties! Let him rap. Wait a second, Springfield Sid. Springfield Sid. Wow, Joe. - Your party... - I mean, I don't need this! You're Black. But we're the shadows, so you don't want to play with us, right? That's the way it goes. I'm sorry. Your time is up. Come back with somebody. It just so happens, and it's very unfortunate, but she thinks just the opposite. Right. Yeah, well, you have your theories, Ted, I have mine. That's what makes medicine. Obviously, I have more training than you have. Oh, come on, that was just... No, wait a second, wait a second, wait a second! Joel. This is free... This is free. Why don't you be the first to take off your clothes? I mean, if you were really healthy, you would. We're all waiting for somebody to be the first. Put on some music. - Springfield Sid? - Fuck you. Come on, put on some music. She wants to be first. What you want, baby? - Aretha? - Yeah. Something like that would just be really nice. Oh here, let me help you. Good, baby. I have something... Better sit down, sit down. Sarabell's gonna be the first. And wait until you see what I have. Oh, really? What is that thing, what is that thing? Oh my God. What is that? What is that? Wow. Oh, yeah, beautiful! Yeah! Oh. Oh yes. Come on, let's do a number. Oh yeah, all right! Aww, Joe. Oh, it's cool. Don't blow it. We need dope. Where are you going? Joe. Oh... Talk to me. Joe. Oh... I'm looking for the man. Oh! Go, Joe, go. Joe, go. I'm looking for the man on the moon. I'm looking for the sea of tranquility. Tranquility I lost. In the craters of the moon. We're looking for the sea of tranquility. Of tranquility we lost. In the craters of the moon God. Fucking incredible sometimes. Fucking incredible sometimes. They really teach you that in that, uh, fashionable finishing school? What are you, a longshoreman? Fucking... One of those cops beat you around the head, you smut-mouth. And I went out to the Cape? Yeah, I know, you told me, five trips. But why don't you wanna make love to me? Because... you're all tripped-out, queen of speed freaks. You're screwy, baby. You ever see the inside of a 24-hour cold capsule? That's what your chromosomes probably look like. If I knock you up, we'd probably have a giraffe. Do you really think that? You scared? Yes. Good... Good. Come on, baby. Look, Joe. Suppose my parents find out. Will you adopt me? Are you finished? Aren't you gonna fuck me anymore? - That's what I came here for. - Hey. I thought I could count on you at least for that. You know, you didn't satisfy me. Hey, hold it down. Noo! You're just gonna leave me like this? Please! I can't stand it anymore. What am I supposed to do? Shh! Goddammit. I can't masturbate anymore, it doesn't do any good. I'm leaving, Joann. Well, what do you want me to do? What do I want you to do? What do you think I want you to do? You can go. I'm not leaving, you're not kicking me out of here. I'm staying here. You don't know what you're talking about, Joann. I want you get dressed and I want you to just get outta here. I'm not leaving, baby. You got some place to go, you can just go. You're not kicking me out of here, not after what you did to me. What I did... What did I do to you? What did you do to me? You ruined me. I lost my job because of you. You'd keep me up all night making me screw your friends. Earl kicked me out because of you. What do you mean, he kicked you out? He kicked me out, I got no place to live. No place to live. I don't even know where my clothes are, baby. And you did that, you just take care of me, you fag. You think I'd come to you? You can't even fuck me if I could get anybody else. You are the bottom of the barrel, you're the last one. They all kicked me out, baby. I hate men, you understand? I hate men! They degrade you wanting to be female, just being female. You can't stay here. Why not, if you're not gonna be here? You're not gonna be here? You're not gonna be here... I got no place to go! You used me! You used me. You betrayed my trust. You exploited me, you wrote that... You wrote that about me. You better let me stay. You're not... no, I'm gonna report you. I'm calling your wife, you're not... No, you see, you ruined me. You better take care of me now. I don't give a damn what you do, I just want you to get dressed and I want you to get outta here. You don't even know what you're talkin' about. Why? Please let me stay. Let me stay, I got no place to go. I don't want you here, Joann. I want you out of here. I do not want you here! All right, I'm gonna ask you one more time. I'm gonna ask you, please, you're gonna get out of here before I kick you out of here. No, I hate you, I hate you. - I don't want you here. - I don't wanna be here! Don't you... Don't you understand? I've got no place to go. Let me stay here one night. Oh, you'll find some place to go, don't worry about that. I don't want you here, Joann. - Why? - Because you stink! You know? You smell, you know that? You screw everybody, you fuck everybody! Don't you ever bathe? Why don't you change your clothes? It's your fault that I stink! I've got no place to bathe, I don't even know where my clothes are, baby. All right, here they are. You just get yourself together and you get outta here. No, it's killing me! Don't! It's killing me! If I get pissed, you can be sure I'm leaving. I'm not coming back. You can beg me... you can beg me, you ain't getting it. You do to women what castrated women do to men. You don't castrate women, do you? You just give them hysterectomies. You just give me a hysterectomy. God. I'm leaving! Get out. Oh, I wouldn't wanna forget this. Oh, wow. Well, the odd thing is is that, uh... I can pretend that I'm there now, watching this, watching... all of the film so far so that I'm... look a certain way, move a certain way, and talk a certain way, and I... I'll never change. Don't you feel like we've done this a long time ago? If we did, it's something I would have remembered. But I do feel very comfortable with you. I don't mean that in any, uh... I know what you mean. Me too. My. What's the matter, Joe? Marilyn, uh, I have to tell you something. - What is it? - I lied to you. Uh, I thought you wouldn't like me if you knew the truth. Marilyn, I-I-I, I see what's happening between us now and I want you to... I wanna tell you. Sure, Joe. - Tell me all about it. - Sit, sit. Well, I... What did I... What did I have this... this machinery on for? Please. Don't run away from anything that isn't real. God! Please. Make me stop. Please. Aw, shit. It... Joe. Does anybody know that you're here? Anybody at all? So what are you gonna do? I mean, what are you immediate plans, as we say? Hey, Joe. You listening to me? This is Monica speaking. I came here to see you. I am Monica, do you know who I am? I'm going to leave very soon, Joe. However, I don't like to leave you like this. So if you don't want to tell me what you want me to do, then I'm gonna have to think of something myself. Did I do this to you, Joe? I mean, is that perhaps what you're trying to tell me? That I did this to you? I mean, are you doing all this to yourself only in order to get back at me? Hm? I mean, only to show me that this is what I did to you? That's pretty dumb, isn't it, for someone as brilliant as you. Joe. I know that you're listening, and I know that you're playing a game. So I'm going to talk, okay? I don't... see, I don't want you to haunt me for the rest of my life. 'Cause I haven't done anything to you. So I don't want that, you understand? I don't love you anymore. I, uh... I can't help that, can I? I mean, that's not really my fault. So... so why are you doing this to me? And I don't want you following me around for the rest of my life. It's as simple as that. So I want you to get out of this building. And I'm gonna see to it that you get out. And you're very sick, but... I'm sorry about that. But you see, I do have the right to live my life in peace, too. But you need help. Even if this is some sort of joke, I think you need help. You ought to be in a hospital, right? You should have somebody taking care of you. I'm going to call Noelle. Joe... what did you want? You must want something. I mean, you're not just throwing away your life for a whim. Please, Joe, tell me. I'm here speaking to you. Joe... I know that you're sick. Do you understand me? Joe, please answer me! I mean, give me a sign! Nod, yes, something! Oh, Joe, come on. I'm your friend. Joe. Joe... an address. Was there anything else on it? No. I knew what it was about the moment I saw it, Joe. I'm no fool, really. I knew what it was about the moment I got it. Who is Joe Glassman? You? Yes. Have you had... many women up here, Joe? Answer me, I know the answer, I just wanna hear it from you. Yes. Many. I want a divorce, Joe. Okay. Didn't you? Asked for one a long time ago. Not leaving me in the best of circumstances, you know. What would you do if I were poor, Joe? If I didn't ha... I'm sorry. I don't want anything from you. I know you've been sick. I know you don't have anything, not even a job. Job? New York? Far away. I may. You will. You're so conceited! I bet you think I could never forget you! Why do you have such contempt for everybody? Sorry. Spoken already to a lawyer. Hm. I hope things work out for you. - Is it on? - Mm-hm. - I don't believe you. - It's on. This is it here? Mm-hm. Can you hear it now? Can I see it sometime? - What? - The film. No. You mean I can never see it? Why do you want to see it? Because it's important. It was important; It's not important now. Are you sure it's on? I said it was. Can we leave it on? Yeah, we can leave it on, if you'd like. What shall we do? I feel strange, Joe. What do you feel? I don't know. Let's make a movie, okay? - About what? - About us. I already did, didn't I? No, about us now. Look. I really feel very, very strange. - Yeah? - Really. Will you turn it off so we can start again? No. Just leave it on. Oh no, turn it off. Let it run. - Why? - Why not? Well, this is our movie. Yeah? Our movie within the movie. Oh. - Please turn it off so... - Let it run. - Okay? - Okay. The electrical dust is starting to rust her trapezoid thermometer taste Find somebody to love Data control and IBM, science is mankind's brother. But all I see is draining me on my plastic fantastic. Plastic fantastic, yeah. Plastic fantastic Her neon mouth with a blinking talk smile is nothing but electric sign. You could say she has an individual style. She's part of a colorful time, yeah
