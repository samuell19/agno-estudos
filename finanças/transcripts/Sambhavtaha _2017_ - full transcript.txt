Welcome. Please sit. Vinoba... What's all this? Nothing much. Just curry and bread. And a lot of country! You have two sons right? No. I have two daughters. Do they go to school? Yes. And you must be the sole bread earner in the family? I was just ten years old... when my father passed away. I had to work as a tar mixer in a road construction company to make ends meet. Look at my blackened palms. Our father...just refuses to grow old! Because your father isn't a farmer! Cheer up Vinoba. Good days are just around the corner. Please eat. Cheers. What a good-looking onion. We call it the king of Laasalganv! Knife? What for? Makes you cry...our onion! Vinoba... Vinoba... Let's talk about your land. My wife believes... That I have an affair with my land because I spend most of my time with it. That I only come back to her in the night. She often tells me that I should sleep with my land only! Then why don't you? I do. Sometimes with the sugarcane spread in two acres, sometimes with the onions, and at times with the uncultivated. What pleasure do you get out of that? Dhere sir... hand me over that tab. Take a look. Vinoba. How's the project? Amazing right? Sir what do you call that game... where a bunch of players keep beating a ball with their feet? Football. That is what has become of us - a ball! Only the kicker keeps changing. A player wants to build a dam, he kicks us in the back and we land up in Aurangabad. Another wants to lay a broad gauge, so he rolls us far away to Shahpur! Now a new player wants to build a highway. So give us one in the backside again! You're about to make millions what's the harm in taking an odd kick in the butt? O onion... O potato... where do you belong? O onion... O potato... where do you belong? My daughter says They belong to the earth. It is their village, They belong to the earth. It is their village, their taluk and district. They remain the sons of soil They remain the sons of soil even after their umbilical cord with the earth is cut. even after their umbilical cord with the earth is cut. Jagan. Some more? No no. You planning to get us drunk or what? We have to go to the other villages too. Come on. Stay for a while. That's enough. Sir land isn't going to run away somewhere. And even if it does you will chase her down! Right. Take his signature. What? Make him sign. Vinoba... Sir I have an idea. Build the highway over my head! What say Jagan? Good idea right? I will stand like a pillar. Let the highway curve over my head. Dhere sir. I will convince all farmers. We will all stand stiff like pillars. And won't even move an inch. Build highway over our heads. Enough with your tales of woe. Let's get done with this. Fine. This file contains the signed documents of my land. Aye Vinoba. Where are you going? Vinoba. Vinoba. The government is giving a high compensation what else do you want? Why are you insulting sahebs? Aye leave him. Motherfuckers! Have you ever asked us what we want? Vinoba let's sit and talk. We won't take your land against your wishes. I told you all my documents are there in that file. But I have a condition. Aye I can fell sugarcane from a hundred feet away with this sickle. You better stay where you are. Brother... Let him go. What's the condition? One of you must hang himself right here. Commit suicide! Fucker why don't you hang yourself? You farmers are anyways used to it. Aye... Don't you dare hurt him he's my baby brother. Tell your saheb to hang himself then! Vinoba we are servants of the government Just following the orders. Good. Tell your junior to hang himself. Dhere sir... Are you out of your mind? You dimwit. Your brother is your business. Sir he will cut my brother's throat. Dhere sir. Sir the car keys are lying here. What are you doing? Leave me. What's the hurry sir? Drink it sir. Drink. Have your last one. Where were you going? Do you want to live for hundred years? You're retiring soon anyway let me retire you now! Should I? Let go. I've waited so long. Now let me sit on your chair for a while. Put the noose in his neck. Sorry sir... Let go. Click a picture. Closer. What? Go close! Go on. Show everyone... whose neck is in the noose now. Send this photo across to the world and whatapp me as well! O saheb... Don't forget to take my file. (NOTHING) My younger one sketches very well! Who was it? What happened? Dogs. Scared them away with the sickle! Can't cut an ordinary sugarcane and you are doing antics with the sickle! Go to sleep. PROBABLY
