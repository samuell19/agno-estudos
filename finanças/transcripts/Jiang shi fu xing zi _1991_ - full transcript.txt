Why are ducks making sound like gua gua Don't know Of course you don't but you'll know if I tell you Long ago, cocks did swim but ducks didn't One day, a cock was swimming in a river A duck was watching stupidly on the bank He wondered why a cock could swim So he decided to ask the cock Cock...why can you swim? The cock answered him like this Of course I can, I have balls - So I can swim - What are balls? - I'll tell you later - There are balls The duck couldn't understand Why can one swim if he has balls? I don't believe you can swim with balls Unless you lend me your balls I'll believe if I can swim with your balls Will you lend them to me? Think for a while, the cock answered OK, I'll lend you my balls Take my balls and you can swim Taking the balls The duck plunged into the water and he really could swim The duck said: I can swim with balls Then the cock said to the duck You now believe You can swim with balls Then give me back my balls The duck said: you are nut I can only swim with balls Why must I give you back? I am not so stupid Then he swam off...until very far away He then said: I can only swim with balls If I give you back, I'll be nut (gua gua) The cock was so angry but he could do nothing Cock could only stand at the back shouting: Give me back balls (ko ko) Since then all cocks make sound like ko ko... - And ducks make sound like gua gua - Ghost Ghost? I have a ghost story now Sit down... Sit down... Once... it's frightening I went camping with classmates But we were lost and it was so foggy And the sunning was setting We found and found - But couldn't find a way out - There's a ghost - Don't shout - We walked and walked Suddenly there was a thunder And then it started raining heavily We could only But walked in the rain We walked... Suddenly we came across an ancient temple We then rushed over we pushed the door... But however hard we tried, we failed We could only take shelter under the eaves We waited and waited but the rain grew even harder Suddenly the door opened We were all scared, we looked at each other Then the door opened all up all at the sudden We were all scared to a jump One of my classmate had big gut He went inside the temple and searched It was horrible inside Suddenly many bats flew about And even flew into us So we took up sticks to fight with the bats One of them even bit my colleagues' ear He cast the bat away with a stick What a pity, his ear was bleeding It's so horrible Before long All the bats flew away We wanted to leave too The moment we turned away There was a black shadow which jumped towards us Wife... Are you scared? Don't be scared It was a black cat Then we looked at the side of the black cat So there were several coffins there We got so frightened that we retreated My colleague were brave And wanted to open up the coffins with the sticks I warned not to do such a thing But they wouldn't listen, they were taking the clubs And walking slowing to the coffins Suddenly the saw the coffins opening up My colleague got so nervous That he chopped the club in the coffin What do you mean? What? You insulted my wife But she flew to me, it's not my business I'll never tell you another ghost story again What is it? Who wants to listen to you, shit Wife, let's not listen to him bullshit - There is no ghost in this world - There is There is? You are then the ghost Forget it Why are you so nervous? She is not your wife Wash you face Spirit up Want to go to toilet Make myself comfortable Something wrong What is it? Don't be like this... It's evil... How happens? What are you doing? What do you want? Are you nut? How come? I've lost control Why are you doing do? It makes me sick What's going on? Why? What do you want? How come? What shall we do?

I will, but you must come with me Anyone who stays behind is a coward OK, I'll go out too Let's go out together, remember to take weapons Take weapons Open the door Don't come near or we'll kill you Help ... What shall we do? Let's go and rescue him, he can't manage Why must we? The vampires are only biting him Not us They will come for us after biting him He will surely die if we don't rescue him Help... - What can we do? - Let's go out - Let's go - We'll go out I must kill you... Kill you... - Left fist, right fist - Don't fight You'll kill them if you beat them like this They are already dead Left fist, right fist. Be careful I think you shall take action Stop fighting... Why must we stop? They sucked our blood They are so pitiful It's not our fault The King of Ghost force us to do that If we don't suck blood for him He'll read spell to break our neck All we said is true Tell us where the King is? We'll go and burn him I know where he is I went there once Dare you go too? Let's burn him up We must burn him or we'll all die OK, we'll go burn him at once, Let's go We must go too, if you rid the King We'll no longer be controlled by him Ok, come with us But you must break this stuff of us What is this?
