The music. Would you turn the music down? - Our Father who art in Heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done. Give us this day our daily bread. - Okay, Capricorn. Be prepared for surprises today as your moon enters Saturn's path. Interesting turns of events may lie in wait. - Can hardly wait. And love from the past will come knocking at your door. - Only if I miss my monthly alimony payment. - Hey, you know what? You laugh at this stuff, Mike, but my horoscope is always dead on. - How can it be dead on when they just reshuffle the same stuff and print it over and over every few months? - They don't do that. - Yeah, they do. - No, they don't. - Romance was supposed to come knocking on Sagittarius' door two years ago in August. Last year it was Gemini in October, then Scorpio in November, now this month it's Capricorn. - So what, they sound the same. - Nope, same exact words. - What, you're memorizing horoscopes now? That's a little weird, don't you think, Mike? - I can't help it. Always leaving them on my desk. Where's that T. Jefferson file? - You know what? I'm starting to think that this isn't a photographic memory that you've got. More like one of those compulsive things. Here. Really should see somebody about it. - Yeah, sure. Yeah, homicide. Okay. All right. We're up. I see the circus is in town. - Tell me about it. Thought I'd give you guys a headstart on the ton of paperwork you're gonna be pushing on this one. - Well, thanks MacNulty. - Just you wait. This could make your career. - Sure. - You'll see. Aren't you the one that's always bitching about how everything's so boring? - That's Joe, actually. - MacNulty, wait. You must be suffering from early dementia. We're homicide, not arson. - Where's EME? Just been called. He should be here in 15. - Okay. - Neighbor on the first floor pulled the alarm about an hour ago. Fire department found his body still smoldering. Door was locked on the inside. The apartment belongs to a Peter McGarvy. What else you got, MacNulty? The manager heard a couple shots and phoned it in. - Say his angle's a little off. - Yep. Either that, or he wasn't a big opera fan. - The victim was a music teacher at City College. Doesn't look like robbery. His wallet's still here. It's filled with cash. - Window grate's still secure but the glass has been broken from the outside. There's fresh blood on the edges. Looks like he cut himself while he was firing from out there. - Doesn't look like anything's been taken. Soon as I saw the body, I knew you'd love it. You're still into the X-Files, right? - That's Joe. - That's me. - And you're right, MacNulty. This is not gonna be a slam dunk. - Okay, so what? He shoots him and then what? Takes a blowtorch to him? - I don't think this was a blowtorch. Blowtorch wouldn't be hot enough to do this. - So, what's hot enough to burn a body like this? - Well, crematoriums heat their bodies to 1800 degrees, and that's only hot enough to burn the flesh. Then they take the bones, they put them in a big giant paint mixer machine, three steel balls that spin around and grinds them up into a pile to mix with the ash. Whole process takes about an hour. - I knew I was right to call you. You're a real Mr. Science. - Oh thanks, MacNulty. My parents would be very happy to know that my premed and science studies were in such good use. - You know, it almost looks like one of those spontaneous combustion type things. Really? - Saw a special on that once. This guy's a real heavy smoker, right? And he lights his cigarette, falls asleep, and then bang, his whole body fat explodes. The guy's fried to a crisp. - I think we're looking for a ritualistic killer. It's the who and the what that's gonna be tough. One witness, a Mrs. Cohen. A neighbor. Hello, earth to Mike. - What? Mrs. Cohen, she said she got a good look at the killer. - Who? - Mrs. Cohen, the neighbor. - Right. Exactly, great. Yeah, she said he was wearing a black cape and red running shoes. This case is right up your alley. - Yeah, this is our lucky day. Thanks for thinking of us, MacNulty. Number three. - All right. I want you to give it another shot. I want you to take your time, there's no rush. - What about number two? - You have to tell us. - Well, it sort of looks like him. - Thank you, Mrs. Cohen. - Did I get it right? - You know what, I'm gonna have Officer MacNulty walk you out, okay? MacNulty. - Did I tell you he was wearing red running shoes? Yes you did, and we're gonna check that out, okay? Thanks. - Bye. - Bye. - Anything? - Nope, zero. She would've picked out all of them if I'd given her enough time. What about you, what have you got? - Time of the shots were confirmed but no one else saw the suspect. - Let me have anything on the victim's body. - Yeah, no trace of accelerants, no bullets in the ashes. There's absolutely nothing to establish cause of death. - Great. - Oh but Ballistics did confirm that the bullets dug out of the wall were the same type used in World War II. - World War II. That's good. The victim ID? - No, it's not confirmed yet. They got to do a DNA job on him. Oh but they said they're pretty certain that the skull fragments belonged to an adult male. - Adult male, whoa. Really nailing this one down. Six foot five, long red hair, wearing red athletic shoes. Consider armed and dangerous. Approach with caution. - 52, I have a positive on your APB. Repeat, I have a positive on your APB. Affirmative. Keep reading. Okay, there's the car that called in the APB. Must be following on foot. - I knew this was too good to be true. I've got a feeling. Do me a favor, head up Front Street. - Do you have anything to confess, my son? Fire, fire! Move, move! - Freeze, don't move. You okay? - Go, go. - Look out. Police, drop it. Drop the gun. Drop the gun. Drop it right now. Oh my god. Holy shit. - He's lost a lot of blood. What is it? - It's a bullet from a Glock. - What is that, Father? - A weapon used by the police at the end of the second millennium. - No. No Sam, don't. I'm sorry, what? No, no I'm not looking for miracles. I'm just trying to do my job, okay? No, why don't you pretend that you work for us, okay? This guy just killed a cop. No Sam, I heard what you said. The gun he used on us was an antique. I want to know if B and E has a record of any gun collectors being robbed. Yeah, you too, Sam. In a nice sort of way. How's Joe? - He's okay. Bullet grazed his shoulder. They're stitching him up right now. What'd the church say about the victim? Father Emmanuel. Hard to believe that someone would want to kill him. He was just a local priest. What enemies would he have? - We have to find out. It's ironic. - How so? - This was his last day. He was leaving for Rome tomorrow. New assignment. - Confirm the story with the church. Find out if there's any connection with him and the music teacher. - Sure, Mike. What you got? - Detective. I got a weapon that went right through his neck. Severed the main artery. Never stood a chance. - May I? - Of course. Looks like a reproduction of some kind of medieval knife or something. - Yeah right. Psych guys are gonna have a field day with this. Watch it, be careful. - Yeah sorry, sorry. I'm getting a little paranoid. It's the OJ thing, cross contamination. - Yeah, right. I understand. - Can I help you? - No thanks, no. I'm waiting for Mike. I think he's a little busy now. Sure I can't help? - I'm sure. Thanks. - You work in Vice? - Look, let's be discreet with this investigation, all right? I don't want to hear about it on the six o'clock news. May I help you? - I like the tie, Mike. What happened to that photograph memory of yours? You don't recognize me? - Lucy Gamille Hudson. You changed your hair. - Yeah, blue wasn't my color. - That the official dress code for the FBI? - Yeah, yeah it is. So. How's the wife? - Hmm, divorced. - Oh. Yeah that's right, I did hear something about that. Sorry. So, are you gonna keep gawking or have you seen enough? - Well, dressed like that, you must be used to it. So, you still doing that psychic friends network thing for the FBI? - Yeah, that's right. - So in the next five minutes, how many crazy things are you gonna tell me and how many am I gonna believe? - Bodies burnt to ashes, no chemical accelerants, no connections, no answers. See, we're already working on the same case. - You want to go get some... - Coffee? Sure. - So. - So? Let's start by you admitting that you know I have a special gift. - Uh huh. - I can't hear you. - Of course you do. You are the best damn psychic that I have ever met. - Oh, there you go. - Of course, you're the only one I've ever met. How many of these cases have you worked on? - I've seen 26 bodies so far. From big cities to little towns that you have never even heard of. The victims are from all walks of life and they have absolutely no connection to each other. Just really good people who will be missed. - Witness IDs? - Nope. None. No witnesses to the crimes. If they even were crimes. I have anonymous tips, hundreds of hours of interviews, even other psychic consultations. - Well. - So, I heard about your morning and I thought that we might exchange some information. - Change of info. - Unofficially, of course. - Of course. - All right. Each one of these deaths is a classic spontaneous combustion scenario. Too coincidental, I don't buy it. - No, neither do I. - Good, okay, great. Well, you were the first reliable person to see a suspect. So, help me out here. Okay. Hey, Joe. - Hey Michael, he's still alive. - Hey. - Hey bud. - You two dating now? - Well? - No not good, we got zero. Yeah see, it's your horoscope. Day of surprises, remember? What did I tell you? - Yeah, it's my lucky day. You remember the psychic from the FBI? - Chicago, right? - She's back. - No kidding. Hi. - Joe Pilton, this is Lucy Hudson. - Hey. - Nice to meet you. - Now you have somebody else to discuss the exact science of astrology with. With her study of the paranormal. - Really? You're a psychic. So what, you have like visions and all that stuff? - All the time, Joe. How about I guess your birthday for a buck? - No don't, don't tell her. - Come on, Mike, it's only a dollar. Go ahead. - Later. - Mmhmm. - Hey, you're gonna help me. See ya. - Did you tell her my birthday? - No, she works for the FBI. I'm sure she knows everything about everybody. Baltimore. Why were you all the way in Baltimore? - I spent some time there as a child. Can I get you a latte, an espresso or something? We've got this new machine. - I'm pretty old fashioned when it comes to my coffee. Gentlemen. You're late. - How's your detective? - He's fine. - So, what's our next step? - Well, I'm gonna need a little space. - She needs her space. - Ah lighten up, she's cool. It's a New Age thing, right Lucy? - Right, Curtis. - I was telling Wilcox here he's got to open up to new things, new experiences. He's a little closed minded. - She's got nothing. - Look, I need time to develop my theories. Interpreting the paranormal is an art, not a science. - This is ridiculous. If you think he's involved in these deaths, why don't you just bring him in for questioning? Stop the screwing around. - I said that I sensed he was connected to the deaths. I didn't say he was a suspect. I'll tell you when I decide what it all means, all right? - You don't call the shots, Agent Hudson. You take orders, just like the rest of us. We need results on this case now. - Really? And who's giving me the orders? You, Wilcox? - This isn't gonna be like New Orleans, Lucy. - Hey, buddy. Relax, it's cool. - I'm gonna keep your freak show on a very short leash, and I can pull you back anytime. Got it? - I am not your dog, Wilcox. I don't sit, I don't fetch, and if anybody's holding my leash, it sure isn't you, get it? - Let's go, come on, Wilcox. Forget it. - Look what she did to my wrist. - Let's go, leave it. - You freak. - Hey if you want to file a complaint, it's form 345. Don't forget your disguise, Wilcox. - You know, it's kind of hard to imagine you two actually working together. Who? - Who, who do you think? You and that Lucy. - Yeah well, the feds sent her to solve some missing persons case. Got stuck with her every day for an entire summer. - Oh wow, that's tough. - Yeah well, she never lived up to her billing. I was always pulling her out of trouble or she was testing me for extrasensory perception. Or reading my palms. Yeah, so what happened? - So I told the feds that I wasn't gonna cart around some flake with a deck of tarot cards. She was always second guessing me. - So you guys have a fling? - What? No. Sure, Mike. - What are you talking about? She's not my type. - Come on. - Besides, I was married. - Oh, so? - So you're wrong. - So. How come you don't talk about the Sixth Order anymore, John? - I didn't think you believed me on your last visit. Something's happened, hasn't it? - No. - Oh. It's started, right? No no no, of course not. No, but I do, I believe you. And I want to, I want to learn more. - Well it's very simple, Lucy. They are working on behalf of the Sixth Order. - All right, the Sixth Order. Who are they again, John? - They are an ancient religious order. How well do you know your Bible, Lucy? - Well let's just say that I read it. - These servants of the antichrist are best described in the Revelation of Paul. - Wait a second. There's no Revelation of Paul in the New Testament. - You're wrong, Lucy. Several books were omitted from the Bible. In one of the secret apocryphal texts of the New Testament, there's a chapter where Paul is brought to Heaven. Oh, there he perceived and saw a power as great and dreadful, full of wrath and through the mouth of them, a flame of fire. You see, the Mabus have a special voice. A voice that can destroy the human soul. Zap! Just ashes are left of their mortal bodies, as their souls are totally erased from time. We must be careful of their voice. - Okay so, the Mabus. Who are the Mabus? - No one knows for sure who or what they are, but they are helping bring about Armageddon. It's a battle they plan to win. A conflict between God and the Devil, the greatest fallen angel of them all. They travel through time on rings on silver. So you see, there is a war on Earth being waged right now for control of the future. They wish to control the very day of judgment. - It's okay. Yeah, so what if she had a thing for you? - I don't know. Jesus, what do I know? I think she's nuts. - Yeah well, speaking of nutcases, I've got something. Here. It's that ornamental knife. It's not a reproduction after all. 16th century, claim it's worth at least 100 grand. - A couple of days ago that would've surprised me. - Yeah so now, we're looking for a bulletproof vest wearing killer who spares no expense and has found some new untraceable way to fry his victims. At least the ones that he doesn't shoot or stab in pieces. I don't know Mike, this whole thing's getting a little too weird. - Yeah, I agree. Yeah, homicide. You're kidding me. Okay. Yeah, no, yeah. You can owe me though. Lucy's investigation has unearthed a new lead. - Great. - At County, the insane asylum. - Great. - See you later. - Yeah, hey Mike. Have fun, huh? - Yeah. - It's very simple, Michele. - Michael. - Michele. Their chant is so deadly that even the Sixth Order keeps them in captivity. - Sixth Order? - Yes, the order of the antichrist. They plan to bring about the battle of Armageddon, a battle they are confident they will win. The Order has a list. It's a list of people whose souls have to be destroyed. People like me. - Why do you have to be killed? - Because. There is a date as indicated by their religious text. Don't touch it, don't touch it. - When all the people on the list are killed, that will trigger the apocalypse. Evil will triumph. - John, where are the members of this Sixth Order? Where can we find them? - You can't. They haven't existed since the Middle Ages. But they'll find us. They'll find us all. They'll find you. I will praise thee, Satan, with my whole heart. For thou hast heard the words of my mouth. Your armies of the high place shall be cast down to Earth. Satan and the rebel angels will be gathered. We shall create an unparalleled upheaval lasting seven years until the return of Satan. - Amen. This will be of greater use to you. - I think this guy could be a real insight into our case. His doctors turned me onto him for some of my paranormal research. His visions are some of the most dimensionalized I have ever recorded. - Yeah well, I'm impressed but is John Doe aware that he is suffering from a very severe case of interlocking psychotic delusions? - Don't dismiss what you don't know about. I'm the expert on visions here. - You said it. Come on, is this what you do? This is how you investigate a serial killer, a cop killer? - I believe him. I believe that we are dealing with some kind of supernatural force. A demon, a soldier of the apocalypse. - See, here we go again. - It is obvious that this killer is not human. Open your eyes to the truth. - Okay. - Come on, you can't fool me. I ran those extrasensory perception tests on you years ago. You've got it. You've got the gift. - Yeah right. No, you know, maybe. I'm feeling something a little tingling here. - Stop it. - Come on. - Call it what you want. Gut, instinct, intuition, common sense. Use it. You know this case is all wrong. I know you're wrong. - Mike, you are not gonna find the answers in some police handbook that you have memorized. - Yeah well, if you're looking for somebody to believe in demon soldiers of the apocalypse, you definitely came to the wrong guy. - I thought we were working on the same case here. - I haven't made up my mind yet. Really, take your time. Hello there. - Hey. - Excuse me. - He's coming. Help! Down, everybody down. Get down, everyone. Get down. Get down, get down! Everybody, get down. It all happened so fast, Officer. I mean, the one minute... These two guys know each other? I noticed him coming in. Did you recognize him? Dressed in a lab coat. And the next thing I know... Did he say anything to you? There was fire and... - Nostradamus. So much for your theory that he wasn't human. Demon, I don't think so. Shame you were too late for this guy. - Yeah. - Are you sure that's the creep that shot Joe? - Yeah, I'm sure. That's him. - What a hunch you had. - Yeah. - This is the house of God, Mike. You don't need a gun here. You must remember the name Garamond. He is a medieval scholar and a cult authority. You must fear him. The uncovered secret documents hidden in the Vatican archives. Hidden since the Spanish Inquisition. A codex of time theory. - Codex of time? - Yes. The last book of Leonardo da Vinci. Confiscated by the Vatican. It contained plans for a time machine. The origins of this machine with its enchanted rings had been disputed for centuries, but it did exist. - Time machine? - In 1965, Garamond used it to travel into the past, erasing his very existence in the present. He traveled back to the 16th century. A time he knew the position of the planets to be optimum for time travel into the future. And now, he and his followers, the Sixth Order, they plan to alter the future, bringing about an age of darkness and fear, Armageddon. And you, Michele de Nostradamus, scholar, doctor, astrologer and prophet, you must stop the Sixth Order before they bring about the apocalypse. - Nostradamus, I am not Nostradamus. Who are you? Do you not recognize yourself, Nostradamus? - The Centuries by Nostradamus. Astrologer and seer of our time. Where's your tarot cards? - Thanks, I knew I forgot something this morning. You ever read any of his prophecies? No. - He fought the plague with modern methods. Interesting guy. Scholar, scientist, philosopher. - Yeah, wait a minute. He was that guy that they accused of witchcraft because his predictions were so accurate. - Yeah, yeah that was the guy. - Lucy really has had an effect on you, huh? - Never. - Come on, Mike, I know you. I see the wheels turning. - This is the one you want. - Yeah, thanks. - Oh my god. What the hell? - What is this? Where are his possessions, the ring that he was wearing? - Homicide requested them. Here's the evidence you ordered from EME's office. Thank you. - What's that? - Looks like the killer's things to do list. - It's like the son of Sam type thing. Let me see it. Homicide. Mike! - Stop it! - There's been a horrible mistake. Help me, quick. - Yes, my lord. What is your name? - Michael. - Why are you here? I'm a police officer. - How did you get the ring? - He was dead. It was the killer's ring. - He's died for our cause. The time machine. How did you discover it? Who betrayed me? - Time machine. This is crazy. It's okay. I'm not here. You don't exist, this is all in my mind. - Take the ring. I want him more talkative when I return. Michael. - This woman is next on the list. You must kill her while the stars are in our favor. The millennium is approaching. Who are you? - Joseph Mercurin. - Why are you help, where are you taking me? - You are Nostradamus. We've been waiting for you. Michele, drink this. - Your body's unaccustomed to time shifting. - He is regaining his strength quickly. - We are here to help you. Your system's still in shock. Adjusting to the new realities. Where am I? - You're in France, in the year of our lord, 1536. That's impossible. - Michele, I am Astrologer La Font. - Oh. - And your arrival here has been long predicted by the stars. - You're insane. You're a hallucination. - You have arrived on the day of Nostradame. You have traveled to us through time. - And our patience has been rewarded. You shall reveal the future to us. Your dream. - Michele, please, please. Sit. Michele. I wish it were a dream. But it is all too real. - No, no, no. - Believe. Believe it is true. Just as we believed in you. I'm afraid he's come too late to stop Garamond's plan. - Garamond? - The name is known to you. - Yes. It's from a dream. - And his plan to alter the future, to bring about the apocalypse. - Yes. Yes. A list of people to be killed. - You see? You are the one. - The name on this list is the last person to be killed before the stars deny them. Lucy Gamille Hudson. - Okay, okay. I will need your help. - Okay quickly, this way. - We must hurry. You have only until Mercury's rotation passes. That's 13 hours and 12 minutes before the machine returns you to us. - I plan to stay where I belong. Only the planets decide how long you can stay in the future. - I don't care about the planets. I am from the future, I will stay in the future. - I'm sorry. When the machine brought you here, it erased you from your time. - What? - You belong with us in the past. Listen to me. This ring, the machine will track you through time but you must be wearing this ring. Do you understand, or you will die and turn to dust. Do you understand? - Yes. - Then go quickly. Hurry! Quickly! We must hurry. Now! - Joe. - Yeah. Joe, it's me. - Who? - Look, Lucy Hudson is in danger. I need your help. Who is this? - It's me, Mike. - Who is it, what's wrong? - Who is this? - It's your partner. It's Mike Nostrand. - Wrong number, pal. Look, I don't know who you are and I don't know Lucy, all right? - Doesn't matter who I am. June 5th, 1994, you were working Narcotics with Mallory. Mallory lifted 5800 bucks from a coke bust. You refused to turn him in. - I don't know what you're talking about. - Yeah you do, Joe. And I can prove it. Now, unless you want me to go to Internal Affairs, I suggest you meet me right now. - All right sure, where do you want to discuss this? - Red Top Diner, half an hour. - I got to go. - Yeah. - What happened? Where is he? You helped him to escape. - You must be mistaken, Father. - We'll see. Take him. - Oh yeah, I recognize you, you creep. - What? - Just tell me how much you want. - Wacko. - I guess I shouldn't be surprised. You don't recognize me. - Yeah pal, enjoy it. - So then I don't exist in this timeline. - Yeah, whatever. Look, what's your angle? What do you want with me? - No Joe, I don't want anything from you, Joe. - Don't call me Joe, okay? I don't know you, Mike. And I don't want to. - I just, I wanted to see you face to face. Look at this, you and me, we were partners for five years, Joe, partners. - Nice try. You stole that. There's no Michael Nostrand in our precinct, let alone my partner. - Joe. - I didn't come here to play any games, okay? I came here to tell you in person to stay the hell away from me, you got that, Mike? - Look no, we have to stop them, Joe. Okay, I can't do this alone. Don't you see? - All right, who? Who, who do we have to stop? - It doesn't matter. Okay, look. They're trying to change the future. We have to get Lucy Hudson to safety. If we don't, it will be the end of the world. The apocalypse. - Okay look, pal. You're dusted to the eyeballs, okay? Go home, get some sleep. - Joe, I need your help. - Yeah, you're right about needing help. Rehab and a good shrink. Hey it's Lucy, at the beep. You know what to do. - Last night... - Did he get it? - Never stopped. - So what are you gonna do about this creep? - Ask me in two hours when I'm awake. - Well you can always just go to your supervisor. - He is my supervisor. Wish me luck. See you later. - Do I know you? - Yeah. I hope that you do. - No, sorry. I must be mistaken. I do feel that I know you, that we've met. Michele. - Thank god, I knew that you'd remember me. Thank you. - Okay. Okay. Although I am a psychic, I'm not a fool. - I know that. Are you on any kind of medication? - No. - Have you been in an institution? - No Lucy, I have not been in an institution, okay? - Okay fine, relax. Don't get all worked up, it's not gonna help. We in a hurry? - We don't have much time. - What? - Nothing. - Okay, let me see if I have this straight. No one knows you because... - Because I have been erased from this timeline. Which means that everything that I ever did, it never happened. Like being a cop, working with you. - And now you're stuck in Medieval France with this wizard. - No, not a wizard. La Font. He's an alchemist, an astrologer. They think that I am Nostradamus. - Nostradamus. - Yes. - The scholar. The one who predicted the future, who wrote the centuries. - Correct. - So, it was actually you who wrote those coded prophecies. I am impressed. You are a bestselling author. - Yeah well I haven't actually written them, not yet. Doesn't matter, forget about it. Are you still finding burnt bodies? Murders with no suspects, no explanations. - Yes. - Okay, okay, and is your intuition telling you that it's the supernatural? - Yeah. - Yeah. And you remembered my name. Okay. See, this is the time, this is the time right now, the one that they are altering. - The Sixth Order. - Yes, yes, these murders. They're part of a conspiracy to bring about the end of the world according to their religious texts. - With killer Mabus and time machines. - Yes. Lucy, they are killing, they are erasing innocent souls and... What? - Lucy. You're the last name on the list of the people that they need to kill before the planets move out of alignment. - Okay so, if they succeed in killing me, then what do you think happens? - No it's not what I think, it's what will happen. Okay, what will happen? - It will trigger the battle of Armageddon. It will trigger the apocalypse. - The Four Horsemen. War, famine, flood, disease. - God, don't you see? I have to protect you. - I'm flattered. - Your assassin. The assassin is already here. He is in this time. - I need some help, somebody. Yeah, I have been holding. Okay fine, hurry. Oh Doctor, what's the verdict? - This man you brought in. Has he been traveling in some isolated place? South America or Southeast Asia? - Not a clue, why? - Well, it really doesn't matter. I think we caught it in time so it's not contagious. A week on antibiotics and he'll be fine. - Oh, you didn't tell me what he had. - Yersinia pestis. - What's that? - Bubonic plague. It was very common in Medieval Europe, but it is not common nor is it deadly today. Don't worry. - Yeah, I'm here. No, I was just, I was trying to see if anybody knew who he was there. Okay, all right, oh thanks. Agent Hudson? - Gentlemen. What can I do for you? - Where is he? The guy you said knew all about our case. - The suspect? You know, our serial killer. - Oh sorry, right. Intensive care, that way. - Fine, we'll question him there. Come on, get up, we're leaving. - What did he say? - Come on, come on, up up. - What do I have? - Listen, in about four minutes, my associates are gonna discover that you're not in intensive care, get it? If they find you, you're gonna spend your future in the psych ward for the criminally insane. Come on. Oh and don't forget your pills, Nostradamus. You've got the plague. Come on, let's go. - Where is the police officer? - I am offering you a chance, Garamond. To choose a different path. To save your immortal soul. But you must repent. Garamond, you must repent. He has returned to his time. To save her. To save us. So, it's too late for you, Garamond. Oh god, it's too late for you. Oh God, please forgive me, God. - No one stop him, I want them killed. Ready the machine. - How's our plague victim? - Never felt better. So what's the plan? - Well we can't go back to my place, they'll be watching. And your place never existed, I guess. But I think I do know a safe place. - Great. This was my investigation. It's the same as it was in my case. The victim tried to protect himself from the voice of the Mabus. Mabus shot the speakers out. - You know, I have a stupid question. How does killing me help to cause the end of the world? - I don't know, I think it has something to do with reverse astrology. - So if the position of the planets and the stars affect people from the day that they're born, then if you remove certain people, you affect the planets and the stars? - Yeah, I think so. - So by destroying souls within a certain timeframe, you alter events on Earth. - And you can bring about the apocalypse. - Yeah well, we don't want that. - No. Do you know the name John Doe? The guy from County? - Yeah. Well, he was one of the murder victims that I've been investigating, but I never met him. - That's too bad. He had a lot of insight into this case. I think you would've liked him. You know, I'm sorry that I didn't believe you. - What do you mean? - You tried to warn me. - Well that never happened. In this time. - Yeah I know, but I just, you were right. You were right about everything from beginning to end. And I was stubborn. I was closed minded, and basically, I was a fool. - Okay, you were a fool. You forgive me? - Yeah. Whatever. - How much do you remember about us? - Do we have something special? - Yeah, we did. What? - I just, I don't know, I get the feeling that you didn't like me. - Oh no, I liked you a lot. - Really? - Yeah, really. - Well, you better lay down and get some rest. There you go, that better? - Yes, thank you. - You know. I do get the feeling that I've always known you. - That is great. There's the car. - Well, I guess this is where they've moved intensive care. - No, but I can take you there if you decide to move a single muscle. What is it? - I'm not sure. - Let's go out the back. This one. - Go, go, go! - Oh my god. It's true. You're not insane. Dead end. - Right there. Do you have your phone? - Check in there. Who are you calling? - I'm gonna convince Joe. - Good luck, he'll have it tapped. - Hello? - What is the greatest American car? - Hey, I thought I told you not to call me again. - I'm talking about Lisa at the prom. The girl that you married. I'm talking about the love of your life. - Mike, in here. Joe, you have to listen to me. - Wait, don't shoot. We're FBI. Okay, I admit, she's gone a little too far this time. - Shut up. Can we get these cuffs off? Ow! - 1961 Cadillac. Last great American car, not much of a backseat. - Joe, what are you doing? - Nothing hon, go back to sleep. - I got a weird feeling about this place. Get over here. - How are we for fire power? - Here, take the .45. I'll get the nine mil. - No, you keep it. - Don't be so generous, they're trying to kill you. - Good point. Okay. - Ready, go. Ready, one, two, three. - I didn't ask for this. I don't want the future of the whole world relying on me, on my survival. - It's fate. - It's not fair. - It's gonna be okay. - It's wrong. - It's too late. I want you to head out the back. Get to help. One, two, three. Hey, I got to get to Crawford Street. Ah, you passed it. Back two blocks. - Thanks, man. - Police, drop it. Michael. - Your destiny is to die today. It's time. Until next time. - I don't think so. - No! - You okay? I told you everything would be all right. - Yeah, there's one. - So, let's go. Let's go, come on, let's go. - Guy claims he was my partner. He is kind of familiar, actually. - Doesn't look all that dangerous to me. - I'm gonna miss you guys. - Oh you'll be seeing plenty of us for awhile. - Not where I'm going. - The only place you're going is away. Away for life. - Or longer. - What's wrong? - Nothing. Michele, you are safe. - We must destroy this machine, now. Come quickly, we must get the da Vinci book. This way, the book's in here. Come on, let's go, let's go. I will praise thee, Satan, with my whole heart. Thou hast heard the words of my mouth. The armies of the high place shall be cast down to Earth. Satan and the rebel angels will be gathered. We shall create an unparalleled upheaval. - I'll sit right here. - Sure. - Thanks. Michele. - Yes, Nostradame, you do remember me. - Of course I remember you. Nice haircut. How many chickens did that cost you? Come on, admit it. For a second there, I had you fooled. For a second, yes. - That medieval thing you've got going, it's... - Just trying to blend in. What about you? - Well, the agency took me back. They couldn't live without me. - I missed you. - I missed you too. - Well... Can I take that for you? - Thank you. It took us awhile to find a town where we could secretly build our time machine. - What's going on, why are you back? - The Sixth Order has risen again. They managed to rebuild their time machine. They have a new leader. - Quite a list. - It's a list of every soul the Sixth Order plans to erase. What we have to do is protect these people. - I'm still on it. Yes, you are. - So they still have to kill me. - We'll just have to stay one step ahead of them. I have three days, 20 hours and 13 minutes. Something to do with Mercury and Sagittarius. Where to, boss? - We have an S. Jones, Las Vegas, Nevada.
