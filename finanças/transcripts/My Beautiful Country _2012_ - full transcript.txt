Vlado! - Wait for your brother. - Why? Because I say so. Quicker! You are welcome! Mum, once again, he has no time to eat. Dano, write to NATO to wait until we ate. They know that not in the evening you should eat. Do not tell me! How many things do those know. Damn NATO! Good evening. Hi, Nana, how's it going? What's up? Nothing special. Has your Albanian returned? You really have a handsome father! He dumped you like a bucket of garbage. When are you two getting married? Hello, Albanians! Do you want our land? Then learn our dances! Ene, mene, mixed, he slams into the box. And you... six... out! A step forward. A step forward! One last wish? A request? A poem perhaps? Please don't do this. I have three young children.

Give us our bread today daily, and forgive our sins, as we forgive them to our debtors. Amen. I come! I know exactly where you are, Danilo! You fell for it again! You fell for it again! What should I do with Danilo? You should see it. In the choir everyone sings, only he keeps his mouth shut. Keep not talking. What are you watching? You promised to stay with me.

Why do you wear pajamas of the Albanian dad? I just lent it to her. Why did daddy die? Dad is not dead, he's in heaven. Come. Mom, will the Albanian kill us? Who knows if he will spend the night. What if it survives? Do not worry. Mom is careful. Sleep now. If the pilot had sneezed, the bombs would have fallen on us and we would all be dead! Who is the idiot who parked here your tank? They could all kill us. I suggest... to celebrate this day together from now on. Do you agree? Vlado, don't touch. Have you ever seen a dead man? Me neither. Where do they take it? By plane? Danilo! Let them play. I don't like when they play to war. They just pretend to play to war. Sorry. Danica ... - It's about your son. - Yes? He's a good boy, though ... I only took it because she asked me. Even if he doesn't sing, should at least pretend. It should open its mouth. To ... or ... i Do you understand? Danilo! Here is one more. Look. See how sharp it is? In this we see better. They look the same. What can it be? Belgrade announces a new bombing of NATO planes. There have been new civilian casualties between the Albanians and Serbs. Apparently, they have been used illegal ammunition. NATO has stated that i bombings will continue until ... Milosevic will not stop the repression of the Albanians. There was a big one like that! You fell asleep again with a cigarette? Where's the big fish? It is already in the Black Sea! I have to go. Thank you. But not for cigarettes! I quit two weeks ago! The money should have been here long ago. Belgrade no longer sends pensions. I'm sorry. What am I supposed to live with? I have kids. - I have a right, do you understand? - I'm sorry. We are all sorry. Mom, the fridge is empty. I know. Today I do the shopping. Good morning. I'm going shopping. I got the money from her purse. Here we go. Thank you. Stop! - Where are you going? - On the other side. - Don't go there. - Why? It is too dangerous. They will shoot you. Go back! I don't want to see you here anymore. Hi, Vlado. Hi, Fatso. What's new?

With butterflies. Thanks for not betraying me. Do I have to sleep in the kitchen? No, it's okay. My dad promised me a bike, then he died. I remember that... my father came back once from a trip. Sometimes he spent a whole month away. That day he brought me a pocket watch. That watch is the only thing that I have left of him. Flies should sit down they leave. Cows cannot sit. - Why? - Because they're stupid. What if they wear pants? Kiki, Bobo! Look who's there. Pap! Pap! - Who gave birth to you? - Dad! - Not mom? - No, dad! Good boy! Watch out for the kids. Who knows what they shot with to the tank. I don't want to see you with that anymore Albanian. - His place isn't here. - Patko, please! I don't want you to play war! It's clear? Say something! Where have you been so far? I'm talking to you! Vlado, come already! Danilo! Come to mom. What's wrong with you today? Why are you alone, Vlado? These are dangerous times. As you want! Why do you go on these broken roads? - Where should we go? - From another part. At the Tour de France. Let's count a little. They are not enough. And now? I will bring the rest. When? Tomorrow. Tomorrow is fine. Do you want a juice? I have to earn some money. Yugoslav experts say that NATO uses ammunition with depleted uranium, that, after prolonged exposure, they can cause serious illness. These dangerous substances are released at the moment explosion and scattered by the wind over long distances. Mom! Danilo stepped on a chicken. Why did you come to us? We don't have a cellar, we have to go to the neighbor. His Albanian stabbed Maria's cousin. Nana, come to us. Nana, your father kills people innocent? Shut up! Shut your beak once!

Thank you. My bag! So, boy? What's new? Do you have a cigarette? I? I do not smoke. Are you going to school? No. You can smoke and you can't go at school? We are teachers, you know. You teach biology and I ... French. Why French? Thank you. It would be so, if everyone did Comets. I mean nothing. I do not understand you. Do you want to sing or not? That's all for today. She has no idea. I find it right that you don't sing. As soon as you males open your mouth, you see how stupid you are. There is nothing you can do about it. What's going on with you? You are sad? What do we do now? Go turn up the volume. Goodbye. Do you want a juice? I'm in a hurry! Watch out! Do you remember when I jumped from the bridge? I was flying like a bird! It is a reminder of my grandmother. And was he a truck driver? This is worth nothing. I'm not a distributor of chewing gum! Can I have another one? Which? That. How do you intend to pay? With these and with those of yesterday. I don't know anything about it. I almost got it on. I don't know anything about it, really. I gave it to you yesterday. Certainly not to me. Why is he stupid? Don't scream, you're not in school. Get out! Give me my money back! Get lost! - Here's your money. - Fat pig! Vlado, look, they have this gifted the students. Why do they let you cross? We all love each other. There are classes on both the banks. Dad and I trained there for the Tour de France. I was also on the Tour. I was always everywhere. The French pay well. This is for you. For me? Come on, we're late. Hello. Did it simply appear? Yes, that's right. Where exactly? Near the bridge. My mother has a photo, the woman looks like you. It is on a box of chocolates. I watched her every evening. My first girlfriend! Put something on. I'm not cold. Where exactly do you live? - Do you know where the town hall is? - Yes. Close to the hospital? The third street on the left. My children were born there. I haven't been to the other for centuries part. You are married? No. Do you have any? No. And I can't swim. Really? Sorry. Dear Rosa ... Do not play with me. Open the door, Danilo! What's up? Let's try from the outside. Danilo! Come to mom! Come. Treasure. Vlado, I'll kill you! I think I saw Miss Pristina, and she saw me too. The conflict between the Serbs and the UCK (army Albanian from Kosovo) is tightening. The Albanians, lean on by westerners, they attack several Serbian emplacements. But the most violent clashes occurred on the banks of the Ibar. Where have you been so far? I was waiting for you. Sorry, I wanted to buy a bicycle. Such a beautiful river is not we will find nowhere else. We will miss you. Here is your bike. It is old, but the tires are new. It is a good bicycle. I am a danger to you ... and your children. The situation is increasingly dangerous. If I stay, they'll shoot us. - I'm cooking. You would have... - No! Do you know what my husband has never been? A coward. As you want. My father says you are an Albanian bastard. I don't know what it means. Me neither. Me neither. Come, children! So, children! Hello. Mom, look. Thing? - Did you get burned? - No. What is this? Come. We put ice on it. - It hurts? - No. - Are you sure? - Yes. According to reports from Pristina, two Serbian soldiers were killed, today and yesterday evening, about 25 km from Pristina. Two others were seriously injured. It is difficult to verify it. Journalists who were looking for to do research on the spot, they were stopped by men with black uniforms with the insignia of the UCK. Today we have heard of new strong gunfights with machine guns and various weapons. Mom! He didn't have the courage to come home. Were you in the tank? Take this out of his hand. Throw it away! Damn war! You men with your wars! A mother would not risk the life of his son ... for a piece of land. Hey, Vlado. Good morning. Good evening. - How's it going to school? - Very well. Tell me... Do you happen to have a new dad? Which is the best dad? The Albanian is not my father! Nana? Nana! Nana! Let me see. Treasure! Danilo, you can't come. Get off. Are you OK? Mom, look. What's going on with you? Mom, I have a headache. Don't worry, honey. Everything will be fine. We will be home soon. Hi, Cevapcici! Come on, Patko, it's hot. Patko, where are you going?

But who did I meet? Danica! Danica! Stay here. Hello. Hi, Patko. Neighbors say that hide an Albanian. Then they are more informed than I am. "Then they are more informed than I am." You know what happens, if not Are you telling the truth? Albanian! Let me go! This is my home! This is my home! Two things I can smell: the snow... and the Albanians. Sweetheart. Jelena! Come on out, old witch! Do you know why your husband left you? Because you can't have children. Come out, so I can see you! Where are you, old spy? Jelena! I thought you recognized the sheep. What about the boy? Boy or girl, I have no idea. Some children have crossed the bridge. I have not seen exactly. Ehi you. How are you? You look like your father. My nose is not that long. Are you drunk? Where's your brother? Danilo! A diplomatic solution It is imminent. Belgrade accepts the presence of UN troops in Kosovo. Although NATO continues to deny to have used bombs with depleted uranium, a fact contradicts it: A German UN soldier he said publicly to have received the order not to go near the tanks, bombed by NATO, because ammunition could be radioactive. The Serbian army claims that NATO has so far fired more 1000 missiles not allowed. There is much fear of the consequences on health, as already in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in the Middle East. You must be glad that you we found. We have to avenge our friends. One by one. Brother, I met a person. We will show the Serbs ... what it means to take revenge. The third street on the left after the town hall. His name is Ramiz Ferizi. I wrote it all down. It will be done. I am looking for this child. See you later, Ramiz. missing What do you do here? Are you sick too? Danilo? What would you say, if you, me, Vlado and mom were we going to live far from here? Wait here! Now we can cross the bridge to go back to your mom. Unfortunately I cannot continue. Go it alone. If they ask you questions, speaks. You're capable. See you soon. Say hello to your brother. And give your mother a kiss for my part, ok? A Serbian soldier. A Serbian soldier dead, I hope! Wasn't it Danilo? Mom! Why is it so dark? Where have you been, idiot? From Ramiz. My dear... I leave. Where is Vlado? I do not know. Vlado! Where are you going? In Paris. Where is it? In Paris! Did you sell your house? Danica, please! Don't you hate them too? You don't have time with two kids to hate.
