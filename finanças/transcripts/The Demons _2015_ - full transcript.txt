What is it, Sophie? Felix asked me for a pencil. No, it's out of the question. But what'll he do? He'll manage, OK? From now on no one lends him anything. Is that clear? Rebecca? Can I get a pencil from my desk? There's not much time, but go ahead. Felix? What? Can I walk with you? - No. Wanna come over? Are you OK? Yeah, I'm alright, thanks. Thanks. Mathieu, jeez! Mom likes to do housework naked. Want something? - No. Walking on the floor I just cleaned? C'mon, out of here. Felix, your parents are coming over. Yeah? Later, after your dad finishes work. OK, enough now. Beat it. Get out of here! Wanna watch one more? Mathieu? Where's Claire? She's tired. She stayed home. Your son's here. He is? - They're asleep. Want a drink? With pleasure. Has he been here long? Since this afternoon. Were they good? - I'm not sure what they did. You look well. Don't know why. Things are rough at work. How come? They want viewers, market share. Fine. But not all of us agree. Wait, I'll put on something. I found it... this afternoon. Who is it? Robert Johnson. Wait. Never heard of him. Very rare. I'm glad I found it. Blues, right! To cheer me up. Sorry. Really. Otherwise things are fine. It's complicated. What about you? Things are fine. I feel good, I'm dancing again. Great. - Yeah, I need it. Build up a sweat. Yeah, among other things. I should get some exercise. Say hi to Claire. Will do. And come again. Sure. Happy birthday to you Happy birthday, dear Francois Mom and I got you a surprise. Here. Of course you didn't expect it. Thanks, Dad. I changed the wheels. Thanks, Mom. With grip tape. And sneakers! Nice color. The cap, too! Awful! We also have a present for Fran?ois. - What? I got you this, Claire. - For me? How sweet! - It's nothing. It's Mara. It's great. I like hertoo. Thank you, I love it! I've something forMarc. Thank you. You buy presents for the parents too? I'm glad. - Thanks, let me kiss you. Course. As long as he doesn't kill himself skateboarding, it should be fine. He better take off the label first. I hope it's not an omen. You always do that. It blew its wad too fast. You idiot! Thanks. - Here. I just want to thank you all for coming. That's very nice. I hope the booze doesn't go to your head. There, happy birthday! Happy birthday! Sorry! - You're so ugly. You look like a pig. You're never here. - There you go... "Never here. Tired!" ...never go to the movies. Or the pool, even? - Sure, why not? I've had it! - What did I do? I'm fed up! - I never ask you for anything! You're always complaining. It's never ending! I can't take it. You're never happy. You're never around. I'm alone with the kids. Shut up, OK? - Screw you. Come here! - Fuck! It's too easy to just walk away. Dad! - Upstairs! Come here! I've had it. It's never your fault! Dad, stop! - Let go. Dad, stop! - Let go. I can't stand you! You drive me crazy! OK? I can't stand you! Stay here and talk. - Leave me alone. What have I done? I want you out of this house! But it's all your fault! You make me feel guilty for everything! I blame you? I can't say anything. - I never complain! I can't stand you. I've had it. Come here! - Stop! Come here! - Stop! C' mere, dam it! - Stop! Come here! Stop! - Dad stop! Stay here! - Get off me! Dad, stop! Let her go! It's over now. Let's go upstairs. Slowly now, OK? Who wants to play tag? Who's it? Who's it? It's me! Who's it? It's Felix! Rebecca, careful! OK, Felix. It's Rebecca! You OK? There. It's OK, I have a towel. You're cold. Yeah, thanks. OK, guys, time to come out. Felix, you have a visitor! What is it? What are you doing? Can I come up? No. What are you up to? I'm busy. Felix, be nice to your friend. He came here to play with you. Cool, Playmobil! Don't touch! It's mine! It's no fun playing with you. We could lie down, take a nap. We could play husband and wife. OK, but how do you play? You're my girlfriend and I'm your boyfriend. Wait, it'll be super cool. Here, put this on. How does it go? I dun no, but girls manage, so you can. But I'm not a girl. Like pants, I guess. Forget that, put this on. This, I have no clue. Forget it. Lie down. Really? Lie down. Your name's Rebecca, OK? Rebecca? What's your name? Rebecca. So she licks the envelope, and gets a tiny papercut. It hurts a bit, but so what? It gets better. But two months later her tongue?s enormous. Huge. It's gross. Like she has a steak in her mouth. Red meat. So she goes to the hospital. It really hurts. They do an x-ray. She has cockroaches in hertongue. When she cut herself, there were eggs on it. They got in her tongue and the wound healed over them. Cockroaches in her tongue! Cool, huh? Thanks, it was delicious! So she had an infection? Want us to help you clean up? Thanks, David. That's OK. Sure? - Yes. I like washing dishes. I used to hate it. A mystery how you could get satisfaction from chores. It's sad if doing the dishes makes you happy. But since Mom transformed me into a slave by whipping me, so be it. I like washing dishes. Seriously! You're off in your mind, not a care in the world. All words. Thank you! Super. Did you change your mind? Don't laugh. We'll do it together. What's the plan? Tonight, Saturday night. I want to do something, for real. Like what? I dun no. The Palladium? Where's your sister? My sister? No, Max's sister. Not mine. She's crazy. We know. It was a joke. Thanks. Since when are you interested? Since I saw her girlfriends. Forget it, you have no chance. - Me? They date college guys. Are you doubting my charisma? Hey ladies, what are you doing tonight? I don't have a car, but I've a shiny BMX. I can take you for a ride anytime. Like a lift? I'm there. Just call me, I'll come get you. What's happening? - Hi, girls. David was just wondering... What? ...if you'd let him go with you tonight. In his dreams. We're going to Alex's. Tough. You won't get home too late? Don't worry. Do I look worried? I love you. Bye. Have fun. Enjoy the ice cream, kiddies. Thanks, so kind of you. - My pleasure. Maybe it snuck in, or she put it in the can herself. It got her #2 million. It's very possible. - #2 million? That's real money. You know, the woman who was nearly raped? Where? On the tracks, right here. My mom heard screaming. She went outside. This woman ran by screaming. My mom let her in and... She'd almost been raped. The cops came. And? It was dark, she couldn't see. But I'm sure it was them... Those redheads for sure. Heard about the kidnappings? What? There's a maniac kidnapping and killing kids. Where? Montreal. They found two bodies. Near here. One in the river, and one in a shack in the woods. Horrible. They were cut into pieces and raped too. Gross. Who does the maniac kill? Little boys your age. Little boys your age. With jeans, a jean jacket, brown hair, brown eyes, named Felix, so... You know. There was a girl who died of that. What? She always ate her hair. It's not funny. In the end... - Intense. She had a hairball in her stomach. You can't digest it so she died. Seriously? Jeez. Weird, eating hair. My god, Denis Morissette. Denis Morissette! With the girls, as usual. He's best friends with all the girls 'cause he's a fag. Yeah, you said it. He still plays Barbie. Barbie? Denis! Cutie-pie! - He's coming over. Great. Hey guys, what's up? Nothing, you? The girls want to go to the Palladium. I'm not into it. Do you know Sandra and Julie? Hello. Hi. Well, see you later. - Ciao. Jeff saw Denis in the park at the marina. Where? - The Longueuil marina. Fags go to ass fuck in the bushes. Yeah, and on Mount Royal. Denis goes there? You bet Denis goes. Look at him. Denis goes for sure. Yeah, but what was Jeff doing there? Where? - At the marina. I dun no. - Good question. What's a fag? Afag's a guy who likes guys and sleeps with guys. Yet h... He's a homosexual. But if a guy has sex with a guy, and they keep their clothes on, is he still a homosexual? Good one. Yes, he's still a homosexual. Same thing. No diff. Hey guys, isn't that the redheads' car? He's over there. - Where? Near the tree. Hi, what's up? Nothing, why? You can hang with us. Doing anything later? - Why, wanna come over? Maybe, we'll see. We wanted to go to the pool with you. It's really hot today. Yeah, I guess. We don't play with you very often. That's true. So, see you later? - Sure. The town pool? - Right. Can you swim fast? Pretty fast. - Me too. Cool, we can race. Felix swims fast too. Right? He's coming! Alexandre! Well, I'll be going. See you, guys. What are you doing? What are you doing? Wrong door, shit. Alex, the exit's behind you. Yeah, in here. You sure? - Yeah, it's a door. Felix? Felix, let me out! Get my lock. Let me out! Quit it! Let me out! Felix, let me out! Let me out! That's enough. Let me out! What? I forget the combination. It won't be long, Alexandre. Alex? We're trying to get you out. Hurry! I'm trying. You OK? You're a jerk! This is my favorite part. Jump in the pool. Go on. It's one way of going in. It's very simple. You're going to take your board and hold it out front. And you're going to kick with your legs as straight as you can. Like this, with the board. Your board straight out, face in the water. And you'll turn to breathe. Got it? Looking good! Faces in the water. Arianne, Stephanie, Melodie, in the water. Anaelle, use both hands. Now swim back the same way. Guys? Want a lift? Sure. Keep going? Stop! It's the house here. - There you go. Thank you. - Bye, Mathieu. - Ciao. Bye Steph. Bye Ben. Felix. See you. Felix, you? St-Jacques Street. St-Jacques is... After Guillaume, right? Corner of Guillaume and Lemoyne? Great, here we go! It's not far. Do you know how to get there? Yeah. - Perfect. You must see Mathieu often. - Yeah. It's not your first time swimming with him? No. - Right. Did I scare you? - Yes. Did you find Francois? No, I think he gave up. Wanna check? Yeah. That's my spot. Watch it. Want some milk, Felix? Yes, please. Good night. Good night. Francois? What? Good night. Good night. Francois? What? Do you find it dark? A little. Wanna open the door? We could put on the hall light. OK, go ahead. Want me to? OK, fine. Anyway, I have to pee. Is that OK? Are you asleep? You really scared me. I totally didn't expect it. Good night. Good night. Francois? What? Is Dad back? I don't think so. He works late these days. Of course, he works for News TV.. He didn't used to come home late. What time is it? 11:30. Yeah, it is late. Good night. Good night. I'm going to talk about my position, I'm a defensive lineman. So my job is to tackle the quarterback before he has time to make his play. What I like about the sport is the contact and strategy. There's always a plan and if you fail, it can cost you yards or even the whole game. The reason I think I can play later is I think that... I run pretty fast for my position and I'm a good tackle. I love the sport, I think it's made for me. And I like it 'cause when you play, you travel a lot, which I like... Dear Rebecca I love you What was that, Felix? Go bring me whatever that was. Go on! And it's a lack of respect for Samuel during his presentation. I'm disappointed. Give it. Stay here. Sophie? Will you be next? I want to cure people who are sick and stop disease from spreading. I'd like to find a vaccine for a very serious disease called AIDS. What is it? AIDS is an incurable disease that kills. You never get rid of it. But drugs can help treat patients. But if you get it, you'll always have it. For the rest of your life. It's found in Third World countries like Africa, China and even India. Here it's more present in groups like heroin addicts, drug users, prostitutes, people paid to make love, and homosexuals, those who love... two boys... a boy and a boy, ortwo girls who love each other. And the first cases of the disease were found in homosexuals in fact. And then... Any questions? Very good, Sophie, but I want to rectify what you said. It's not just homosexuals. No, it can affect everybody. Heterosexuals and homosexuals. Yes. Other questions? No? Thanks for listening. I'm doomed. Hi! Something wrong? I'll go see. What's wrong? Nothing. Did something happen at school? What's going on? Let's make a deal. Anything you say will stay between us, OK? Won't you tell me? I think I have AIDS. Come on, Felix. That's impossible. You don't just get it like... Why do you think... Did anyone... I dun no, an adult... do something to you that makes you think that? No. So there's no reason to think you have AlDS. Even if I don't have it, I deserve to. I did horrible things. Come on, horrible things? What do you mean? What did you do? Go away. You know, Felix... Look at me. It's normal for kids growing up... to do stuff together. Like? - I dun no... Little games or... Like, touching each other or showing their bodies. It's normal, there's nothing horrible about it. That's not how you get AIDS, or anything else. That's nothing bad. Does that help? Coming out? I'm hot. Come on. I'll play you a song. Do you know it? - No. One hand here. One here. I'm sure you'll like this. Patrick? Recognize me? Probably not, huh? Last time I saw you, you were 3, always bawling. You were awful! I'm Sam. I'm a friend, well... your mom?s cousin. I'm visiting here. I just saw her. She's busy, she asked me to get you. Will you sleep over? Well, not just yet. We have other stuffto do first. Like what? What would you like? Go for a burger, or a movie, go swimming? You decide. C'mon, we'll decide in the car. Like music, Patrick? So-so? I have a killer sound system. Uh-oh, run! Aren't you having fun? With all the rides? Whatever you want, we'll do. I promise. I want to see mom. We can't, she's working. We'll see her tonight, I said. Want to call your Mom? You would. OK, come on. Hello? Yeah, it's Sam. - Let me! I'm with Patrick, having fun. He wants to talk. - Let me! You're too busy? He wants to talk to you, but... If you're busy... OK, see you tonight. Perfect. Bye. She didn't have time to talk, she's too busy. You'll see her later. Is everybody ready? In 3, 2, 1! You're so beautiful. Aren't we going? After you finish your pop, OK? You're really cute. Patrick, no, wait. Look at me, OK? Don't cry, I just wanted to give you a hug. I wasn't going to hurt you, just hug you. Don't cry. If you cry, I'll cry too. Everything's fine. Alright? We'll go home. I have a brainwave. A friend of mine, he says that over there, there's a treasure buried. We'll dig it up. But it has to stay a secret. Do you like secrets? Yes? Do you like secrets? Yes? We have to get it now. Or my friend will dig it up and he'll get rich. And we should get rich, not him. Wanna go look? Want to? Let's go. Do you want to play dodge ball? Yes! I'll be captain of the first team. We need another captain. You're going to have a great captain! Come here, Mathieu. I'll start. - OK, sure. So, my first pick will be... Mathilde, please. I'll choose Mederic. So we're team 1 and you're team 2. That sucked. We shouldn't have watched before bed. It wasn't even scary. Missing Child That film was lame. But I saw one recently that was really scary. About a woman scared that dead people will haunt her. The more she worries, the more ghosts do appear. And the worst part? It's a true story. No way. What's the film called? The Entity, I think. It said so: Based on real events. Why do the ghosts come back? She just thinks about them. She's afraid and that attracts the ghosts. No way. Good night. They write it's true to scare people. I dun no. Good night. Good night. Are you asleep? Francois? Mom? Dad? I had a bad dream. - Oh yeah? I had a bad dream. Can I sleep here? Marc? It's Felix. Felix had a bad dream. Good night. Good night, Mom. Good night, bunny. What's wrong, you're squirming. Can't you sleep? - No. How come? I'm scared. Don't be scared, I'm here. Nothing will happen. Go back to sleep. Think about... I dun no. Going to the lake this summer. Having fun with your cousins and Emmanuelle and Francois. Think of the lake. Summer vacation, the lake. Are you alright? You haven't said a word. I'm just tired. You haven't been yourself. What's wrong? Want to come in? No, I think I'll... I think I'll go home. Ben? Do you love me? Why are you asking? It's like you don't want to see me. Don't worry. Yes, I love you. Did you meet somebody else? Where could I meet someone? We're always at the pool. Sometimes we're not together. No, there's nobody else. Well, I better go. Hello? Hi, Nicole. Yeah, fine. And you? Tomorrow? I'm not sure. I'll ask Claire if she's free. Well, anyway, I'll ask her. Right. Sure. Wait, I forgot. We have something tomorrow. We're going to friends or they're coming over. But we're busy. Yeah, right. Sorry, another time. Bye. Everybody, listen up. Can you all hear me? - Yes! The clues are hidden in the woods around here. There are ten clues you need to find the treasure, OK? Is everyone on a team? Yes! - Not me. Not you? Alright, who... Is there a team of three? - Us? OK, so go with Fred. Here's clue 1. - Zoe, get down please. There's one clue per team, OK? Choose your captain. Here. You can start now. One per team. Here. Wait up, Rebecca. - OK. They run fast. I'm red. Firemen like me. I'm red and firemen like me? It's easy. Afire hydrant! Trees? All alone? - Yeah. Who's your team? - Sophie and Mathieu. Where are they? I lost them. When? - Awhile ago. Where are Sophie and Mathieu? Sophie and Mathieu were making love. - Yeah! They were necking. They were lying on each other. - Having a good time. They were lying on each other. - Having a good time. Don't you guys have a treasure to find? So let's go. Where are Mathieu and Sophie? In the woods back there. Let's go find them.
