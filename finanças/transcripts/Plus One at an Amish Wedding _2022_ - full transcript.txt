Espresso. Fat free double cappuccino. - Why is taking so long? - His frost machine's acting up. He can't get Mario, the repair guy in until this afternoon. I'm kind of a regular here. - I'm kind of late for work. Matcha latte, almond milk. - Sorry, that's my order. - Mine too. - I know how to solve this. I also ordered a. Cinnamon and raisin bagel. - So did I. - Go ahead? - No, are you sure? - Yeah, you're a hurry. - Okay, well, thank you. Thanks. - Thanks. - The feeling in your chest, would you describe that as more of a sharp pain, a heaviness or. - More of a tightness. It only lasts for a few minutes. And it usually happens right after I take my dog, Miss Lily, for her nightly walk. - Okay. Well, your cholesterol has cropped up a bit over the last few checkups. Now I hear you make a mean steak tartar. Your husband told me all about it. And blamed a lot of things on it. So I think if you can just make a few less dishes like that and make a couple other dietary changes, you and Mr. Beauregard should be able to enjoy many more healthy years together. Assuming you want to. I do. How are the grandkids? - The grandkids are wonderful. - Did you get to have that graduation party? - April. - Yeah, there were balloons and. - Why aren't you in room 223. - What's in room 223? - Your next patient waiting, patiently. - Mr. Shepherd. But I thought he wasn't in until 11. - I had it moved up to help you keep shorter appointments. - Just a second. I'm just gonna help Mrs. Beauregard schedule her EKG. - Reception would be happy to help you with that. That's why they're here. - Isn't he a charmer? - Sorry, Mrs. B. Dr. Schneider was just being himself. - Aunt April, Aunt April. - Oh, Zeke what happened? - Scout ran off and a car hit him. Can you help? - Oh sweetie, I'm not that kind of doctor. What you need is a doctor for animals. - There's a veterinarian up on 82nd, that's where I take my Miss Lily. - Boys, they'll get you a ride home, right over there, okay. - This way. - All right, come on Zeke, just this way. Excuse me, sorry, excuse me. Hi, I am so sorry to interrupt. My nephew's dog was just hit by a car. Is there a vet available that could help him maybe. - Oh, let me see what I can do. All of our doctors are with patients right now. Okay. - Not all of them. - You. - Come on back. Excuse me. He'll need to be in a cast for a few weeks, but after that, he'll be ready to rock and roll. - Hear that boy, you're gonna be okay. - Now, what is Scout's favorite color. - Dogs are color blind. - Humor me. - How about, Orange? - Orange it is. - Orange it is. - So mom, Scout will probably need some pain medication. - Oh no, not mom, aunt, Zeke's aunt, Scouts too, I guess. I'm April. - Jesse. Nice to meet you. - Hey Zeke, you should probably call mom and let her know what happened. How was your bagel? - Worth the wait. - I wanted to thank you for this morning and for squeezing us in just now. - No worries, just doing my job. - Speaking of, I should probably be getting back to mine, Beecher Hospital. - That's a wonder why we matched, again. - So, can I give you a card for the cast, X-rays and? - Oh, reception handles the payment. - Right, of course. - But I don't mind getting your phone number. - Hold up, love birds, no toasting without us. - Oh, go easy on 'em May. Remember when we used to be like that? - I still have the slow jam playlist, to prove it. All right, happy birthday to my old sister. Cheers. - Cheers. - Cheers. - Cheers. - Do you still need a few more minutes? - Oh no, I'll have the Bucatini. - Flounder for me. - Could I get this Florentine steak, medium rare? Oh, and I don't want the seared artichokes on this side. - I'll also take the Florentine steak, medium rare, but I definitely want the seared artichokes. - Ooh, could you put my artichokes on his plate? - Sure thing. - Thank you. - I love the way you think. - What's not to love? - You got yourself a good one, Jesse. And I have to say, I think April finally met her match. - Oh, thanks Rob. Well, you and May set a great example. - Oh, you didn't see us chasing Zeke and Scout at the house earlier. But we still make it work. - Oh and Zeke thinks you hung the moon, Jesse. I mean, he only talks about wanting to be a vet. - Yeah, did you always wanna be a vet? - I've always had a heart for animals. - Did you have many pets growing up? Were your parents like animal people? - I guess you could say that. Well, since we're all here. The gift. - Oh, show off. - April, since the day that you came into my office, you have made me the happiest man in the world, besides Rob, obviously. So. - Oh, Paris. - We leave two weeks from Friday, but we can transfer the tickets if you can't get the time off. - Are you kidding me? I haven't taken a vacation in like a year. Yes, let's do it. - Nice one Romeo. - How did I get so lucky to find someone like you? - The part of the date gets such sweet sorrow. - I can't wait for Paris. Thank you again. - You're working so hard. Your situation at Beecher isn't ideal and you've always wanted to go. You deserve it. - As usual, you've read me like a book. Just wish you were that easy. - What do you mean? - Sorry, nothing. Must be the champagne talking. Goodnight. Dr. Hardin. - Good night, Dr. Monroe. Anemia is super common, especially with new mothers. - I thought I was just tired from the baby. You wanna see some pictures? He's just starting to crawl. - Do I wanna see some pictures? Yes, please. Oh my goodness. He is so big. - I know. - April. - Thanks. - Thank you. - Next month. - Yes. - Don't forget. - See then, I promise. - Okay. What can I do for you Dr. Schneider? - We've discussed this already. Our doctors don't have leisure time to spend with individual patients. - I understand that, but I make better diagnoses when I get to know my patients. They appreciate it too. - April, we have quotas to fill. Our job is to treat patients not befriend them. Am I being clear? - Yes, Dr. Schneider. - April, I cannot go at this pace. If you had told me we were training for the Olympics, I would've worn better shoes. - Sorry, sis. - What's got you so amped up? - Dr. Schneider, He's on me again about patient turnover. - I guess first job's always stink, Even when you're a doctor. - He just treats me like I'm a part of a machine. I think the best way to treat people is to treat them like people. But that takes time. And I don't know. Maybe medicine just isn't what I thought it was gonna be? I don't know if I really belong there. - You do. You just have a big heart. I remember when you would bring home all of those strays when we were kids. Maybe that's why you're dating a vet. - Oh. - How is Mr. Wonderful, anyway? That was a pretty serious gift the other night. - He's great. He's better than great. For the first time, I feel like I'm with someone who really gets me. - But? - But, I just don't know if I get him. He hasn't told me anything about his past. I haven't met his family. - Maybe there's a reason he's not opening up. What's what I afraid of. - You know what I mean? Some people's paths are painful. It's not like everybody grew up in suburban New Jersey. I'm sure he'll open up when he is ready. And he obviously adores you. There's no mystery about that. - All right, break's over. Come on, you promised me two miles, let's go. Coffee at the end, coffee at the end. - Coffee at the end. - I don't know, maybe it is time for a change, but how do I know if a different hospital is gonna be any better? And if I do transfer this early in my career, what's that gonna look like? What do you think I should do? - Listen to your heart. - I hardly have time to listen to the new Taylor Swift album, let alone my heart. Hey, are you okay? You seem a little distracted. - We need to reschedule Paris. - What, why? - I got a letter from my brother. He's getting married this weekend. - Oh, wow. I didn't know you had a brother or any family actually. I mean, obviously you have a family, but. I'm sorry, did you say a letter, like with stamps? - There's a lot that I haven't told you about me. About my past. - Really? - I'm Amish. - Come again. - I was raised Amish in Stone County, Pennsylvania. My whole family, my mother, my brother and sister, everyone I grew up with, Amish. - That's unexpected. - I left home on Rumspringa when I was 16. That's when we decide between staying Amish or going English. I loved my family, my community, I still do. Part of me, really wanted to stay, but I wanted things that they couldn't offer. So I chose, all this. I need to go home. It would mean a lot to my brother, to me too. - I understand. And I appreciate you opening up to me about all of this. - You're not totally freaked out? - I'm pretty surprised, yes, but not totally freaked out, no, not yet, anyway. - Good. Because I want you to go with me. I'm crazy about you. And I would love for you to meet my family. - That isn't that weird, is it? - He grew up without electricity, in the 21st century. Lots of people grow up without electricity. Like? - Like all around the world. - He's from Pennsylvania. Sorry, sorry. He could have been hiding a lot worse than a butter churn. I'm just happy that he finally opened up. - I don't know if I can do this. - What, why? - I don't know the first thing about the Amish. What if his family, you know. - What? - Judges me? - Well, I know all about that. So does Rob. Won't be the first time you've had to help a family accept someone from a different background. It's not the same thing. I'm just trying to say that you have a good heart and Jesse's family will see that. - I guess so. - And as for the Amish and their ways, I'm sure Jesse will show you everything you need to know. And I might be able to help you a little bit. Well, like the Amish don't show too much skin. So I would go with more dresses and, dresses. - What makes you the expert? - Remember my quilting phase? Rob and I spent a weekend in Stone County a couple years back. We totally fell in love with the place. The Amish have their quirks, but they're are really nice people. It's a really tight knit community. - Good, well then maybe you can recommend a place we could stay? - Well, I have just a spot. We stayed at this adorable B&B and I made friends with the owner. We still exchange Christmas cards. I will text her. Don't be scared. You're gonna have so much fun up there. I promise. - Not bad, huh? - Beautiful. Oh. A horse and buggy. - Yep. Home sweet home. - Oh, this place is so cute. - I know right. - Hey Jesse. - Leroy. - How are you? - I'm good, how are you doing? - Good to see you. - Good to see you too. - Huh? Okay, no way are we just getting one pie. - These are whoopie pies. - These are coming with us. - All right, let's do it. - Oh. - That's a blueberry muffin. - I know what a blueberry muffin is. - If you wanna get really Amish, I would go with the shoofly pie, over there. - There aren't actually flies though in it, right? - Just molasses. - That's perfect. Ah. - All right. Can we get an apple crumb and a rhubarb too? Mom's favorite? - It's been a while since I've seen you Jesse. - I'm just back for Levi's wedding and for your pie, of course. - Do you know everyone around here? - Not everyone. - Jesse, hey. - Hey, Rebecca, good to see you. - You too, how are you? - I'm great, how are you doing? - I'm good. Good to see you, take care. - You too. Okay, almost everyone. It's hard not to in a small town. - It's adorable. Thank you. - Mrs. Fisher. Pennsylvania, Dutch, it means see you later. - Is there anything else you think I should know before I meet the family? - Most of the Amish don't listen to popular music. So they've never heard of Louis Armstrong, Elvis Presley. - Taylor Swift. - Yeah, exactly. Don't get your heart set on dancing to a love Song at the wedding. On the plus side, gonna be a lot of food to eat. - What else should I know? - Well, they don't really pave their driveways either. Okay. Is this it? - This is home, used to be anyways. Man, this place was my whole universe. Working the farm, going to church, reading by candle light, spending time with my family. Life was a lot simpler then, a lot easier. - I still can't picture you with one of those big hats and long beards. - Only bearded men work here. You should've seen my dad's though, looked like a member of ZZ Top. - What was that? Do we have a spare? - Must have. I'll take a look. You Englishers get lost? - You're responsible for the booby trap? - The booby trap? I knew I'd forgotten something. I'm sorry, Bruder. - Good to see you. - Good to see you. - Levi this is April, the girlfriend. - Please to meet you, April the girlfriend. I'm honored you can make it out to my wedding. - I'm honored to be here. You and Sarah must be so excited. - Yes ma'am, Sarah and I are very much looking forward to it. Jesse. - Rachel. Hi. April, this is Rachel, my baby sister. - Younger sister. - It's so nice to meet you. We brought plenty of treats. So maybe you can help me take on this whoopie pie. - Nothing from New York City? - Not this time. I'm sorry. - Rachel is just beginning her Rumspringa. She's very curious of the English lately. - So what if I am? - Easy, Schwester. It's great that you wanna learn more about the English world, but there's a lot of things that you'd miss here too. Trust me. - If you say so. - Rach, why don't you take April inside, Jesse and I can move the car from the driveway for the guests coming tonight. Yeah. - Why don't we take care of the car later? I wanna see mom. - Yes, well do not expect the warmest of welcomes. - She's still upset about Naomi Trotter. - Rachel. - Naomi Trotter? - Friend. We up to together. Amish mothers, pride themselves in their matchmaking skills. And Mom set me up with Naomi when we were basically still in diapers. But she's married, happily married. - No, her husband passed away last year. She's back on the market. - Oh, sorry to hear that. - So am I. - It'll be all right, April. There's a rhubarb pie in there, jah. - Jah. I mean, yeah, yes. - Good. As soon as Mom sees it, she'll forget Naomi, guaranteed. - That's true. Come on, whoopie pie. - Yeah, thank you. They're just back here, thank you. - There you are Rachel. I need you to start on the cabbage rolls. You said I could take a break. - You did, now it's over. What in heaven's name is that? It's a rhubarb pie from. - Jesse Hardin. - Didn't expect me to show up empty handed, did you? - Never know what to expect from you, boy. - I really should go grab that rake. See you all later. - You are too thin. Glad you've returned for some real food. - Mom, this is my girlfriend, April. April, this is my mother Esther. - Mrs. Hardin. - It's a pleasure to meet you, ma'am. You have such a lovely home. - Not quite, been working day night to get it ready for the wedding. Have sore joints all week. Wash those first, Rachel. - What are you cooking? - You'll find out it's supper. Besides I imagine my son hasn't taught you much of Amish cooking. - No, but he did tell me all about rhubarb pie. I've never tried it before. - What kind of woman's never tried to rhubarb pie? Mom. - I apologize. You must have much more worldly pleasures in New York. - I like to try everything at least once. - Of course you do. - Seems like you're pretty busy. So we'll settle in and I'll give April a tour. - She's not staying, is she? The house is completely full. - I have a room in town, at the Country Oaks bed and breakfast. Kinda figured, no girlfriend's allowed. I can pitch in, in the kitchen, if you want. Pretty good with my hands. - April's a doctor. - That's awesome. - Rachel, what have I said about English slang? - Beg your pardon, Mom. Your chosen profession is exceedingly commendable. - Thanks. - Thank you April but we will be quite all right. But should I cut myself, you will be first to know. - So do the Amish actually raise barns? - They do. And put one up in a day when the whole community comes together. This one, this one took us three. - Wow. You built this? - Oh, I held the nails for Dad. I was only about five-years-old. It's beautiful. - Last stop, Hardin pond. Levi and I used to go fishing here. Not much to catch, but once in a while we'd have something for mom to cook up for supper. I always felt bad for the fish though. - Born animal lover. - Strange being here without Dad. We never really got each other, but I miss the guy. I always hoped that we could make peace. Still hope that Mom and I can. - I'm sure you will. - Thanks, but our families are different. Yours gets along. - My family's had some hard times too. Rob and May got engaged in college. Neither set of parents was a excited about them getting married so young or being from quote, "Different backgrounds." - Your parents love Rob. - Well now they do. But it took a long time for them to open their minds and make some much needed apologies. Luckily, Rob and May found it in their hearts to give them a second chance. - I had no idea. - Well, there's some things from my past that I don't like to think about much either. But if my family can reconcile their differences, I have a feeling yours can too. - Jesse, April. - Hey, what's with all the celery? - Cream celery. - It's traditional at weddings. Like mash potatoes at Thanksgiving. - But much more delicious. - A celery garden can be the only way to know when a wedding's coming up. Amish couples are very secretive, which is why this one didn't write me until the last minute. - You know, I've never been one to break tradition. - Wow. It is just so beautiful out here. I could really get used to this. - Careful, pretty soon they'll have you up to milk the cows at 4 a.m. - Levi, Jesse, Mom says to bring what you have, we have to get ready for supper. - Already? - Amish eat early. I wasn't kidding about that 4 a.m milking. - Do you think I should have worn something a little more? - Amish? - I'm feeling a little out of place. - You look great. If it wouldn't scandalize my entire family, I'd totally kiss you right now. - You're the best. - Good afternoon, Levi. - Afternoon. - You must be Sarah. Blessing to meet you. - Same here. - Daniel Trotter, an old friend of the family. Didn't know we'd have the pleasure today. - Well, I suppose your mother didn't tell you. We only received a dinner invitation yesterday. - We? - Do you think I should ask your mom again if she needs some help? Jesse. Jesse. - Naomi. - Naomi, Trotter? - Jesse. It's been a long time. - I had no idea you were coming. - Your mother invited us. We've always been close, especially this past year. - I'm sorry about your husband. - Thank you. He was a good man. Dad, you remember Jesse? - I do, the young man who brought my daughter home from many frolics. - Frolics? - Daniel, Naomi, this is April. - The girlfriend. Hi, nice to meet you. - Of course, Mrs. Hardin's told me all about you. - Oh, none of it's true. - No. I've always gotten Mrs. Hardin to be a reliable judge of character. - Oh, I was joking. - So then all of it was true? - Naomi, there you are. Hello Daniel. - Esther. - I hate to interrupt this little reunion, but I need someone who's actually useful in the kitchen. - No problem. See Jesse, April. Some things never change. You were born hungry, Jesse Hardin. - They don't make food like this in New York. Pass the butter. - But of course. - April, tell me about yourself. What do you do in the English country? I'm a doctor. - That must be rewarding work. - It is. Feels good to help people. Sometimes it's hard, you know, when a patient isn't doing well, or when someone up to me at a dinner party and wants me to check out their cough for their weird rash. If one of you has a rash though. - No rashes here, but your offer is very much appreciated. - To be honest, we Amish, we do not put much stock in English medicine. - Some Amish. - The older, more stubborn ones. - Never seen a doctor in my life. And I've always been perfectly healthy. - Didn't you mention something earlier about having so joints? - You know, with the leaves turning color, the wedding should be beautiful. - We have natural remedies for such ailments. - Well, if that's not working for you, a doctor could probably prescribe something better. - We don't tell Englishers how to lead their lives. We are content to leave well enough alone. Would be nice, if they'd return the favor. We stay out of their lives. Why can't they stay out of ours? April. - Excuse me. Just. Come on. No cars available? This really is Amish country. - April. What are you doing? - I never should have come here. Nobody wants me here. - Hold on. I want you here. Mom's just, just. - Trying to make me look bad so she can marry you off to Naomi Trotter. - Seems like it. But don't worry about Mom. - She hates me. - She doesn't hate you. Okay, I appreciate that you're trying to make a good impression, but if I really cared what my mother thought, I never would've left. It's you I care about. - Really? - Come on, let's go back inside. - No, not tonight anyway. I still need to check into the B&B and I'll have a lot more energy for your family after a good night's sleep. - Whatever you want. - Just one problem, how do I get there? Oh no. - Oh yes. - No. - Aha. - No way. - Yeah. - Is everything all right? - Yeah. I thought this would be a little slower. - We're going pretty slow. - Okay. - Come on, it's not that scary. - Its not exactly a merry-go-round either. - All right, all right. Think I know a way to get us there a little bit faster. - You know a shortcut? - Nope. - Thank you. I could take it from here bell boy. It's getting dark, you should probably get back to the farm. - Oh, well, I guess we'll see you in the morning. Night Dr. Monroe. - Night. Dr. Hardin. Are you sure you're gonna be okay going back in the dark? - I think I'll be fine. All right. I'll see you in the morning. - Rachel. This is not the time to go off by yourself, we have too much to do. - Sorry. What is that? - Nothing. - Where did you get this? Did your brother bring it from New York? You tell me Rachel Hardin. - I bought it, in town. - Why are you so fascinated with the English? - Why are you so against them? - I need you to go to market. Take my list and some money. I need the receipt. - Thanks so much, I appreciate it. Thank you, thank you, I appreciate it, bye. - Is there any breakfast left? - You bet. Come on in. You're April, right? - Yeah. - Your sister May gave me a heads up and a history lesson. Sit. - Oh, thanks. - My husband, Bill, must have checked you in late last night. I'm Tabby we own the place. So how's your stay? - Perfect. I slept like a log last night. I don't think I woke up once. Pretty sure I could spend my whole trip in bed. - That's Stone County for you. Lots of peace, quiet and Amish furniture. - Plenty of Amish, that's for sure. - So not to pry, but how is it with Hardins? I am so sorry to hear that. Some Amish can be so stubborn about modern medicine, about anything modern for that fact. Frankly, I wish there were more doctors around here. - Thanks. - Yeah. - If only miss his harden felt the same. - At least you have Jesse. He's in your corner. Seems like a really great guy. - He is. Which is why he still really want his mom to like me. - The Amish are good people. They just don't take easily to outsiders. Just give them the little time, that's all it takes. When Bill and I first moved here, we didn't feel like part of the community for like ever, it seemed. Now we got a lot of Amish friends. Where do you think I got that pancake recipe from? - Oh, that must be Jesse. - Yeah. - Thank you for everything, Tabby. - Anytime. Go get 'em girl, you got this. - Hey stranger. Oh, Rachel, hi. - Jesse's helping the men set up for tomorrow. So we asked me to get you. We also have to pick up some groceries for Mom too. - Okay, sure. Okay. Okay. No offense, but are you sure you're old enough to drive this thing? - You don't need a license for a horse and buggy. - Oh gosh, maybe you should. - We just need to get a few things. Hey guys. - Hey. - I thought he Amish wore pants. - Rumspringa. - What's all the cheese for? - Macaroni and cheese, Levi specifically requested it. - The Amish eat mac and cheese? - As much as possible. - Wow, you guys are full of surprises. - So tell me about English weddings. - What do you wanna know? - Everything. Do the brides always wear those beautiful white dresses? - Most of the time. And the groom wears a tuxedo. There's usually a nice ceremony followed by a big party with lots of dancing and champagne and cake, with a little plastic bride and groom on top. Then later the bride will throw her bouquet to all of the single women and the one who catches it, supposedly, will be the next to be married. - You mean their mothers don't decide for them? Sounds amazing. - I bet Amish weddings are a lot of fun too. - They'd be more fun with dancing. - Jesse told me that most Amish don't really listen to mainstream music. - Well the church lets us bend the rules a little during Rumspringa. Me and my friends listen to the radio all the time. I love Taylor Swift. - Taylor Swift. Yes, girl. Fist bump. - She just sounds so full of life and so free. - I get that. I really do. But even in the English world, no one is happy and free all the time. Sometimes our world is loud, busy, crazy and crowded. A lot of times it's just downright scary. It can be hard to really get to know people where to find your place. But don't listen to me or your mom or even Taylor Swift. In the end, you gotta do what's right for you. - Thanks April. - Anytime. - By the way, what Mom said last night about doctors, I hope you know, she wasn't speaking for all of us. I like doctors, one, anyway. - Thanks Rachel that means a lot. - Anytime. Now onto much more important matters, ever try Amish rock candy? - No. - Okay, we're gonna need a lot of those. - Levi. Your mother's looking for you. You and Sarah need to go over the seating for the head table. - Well I thought we'd been over this? Is she in the kitchen? - Where else? It's been a long time since we've attended a wedding together. Eli and Emily Yoders, if I correctly recall. - I'm sure you do. - And you don't. No distant memories flooding back? - A few. - I'm sure you have a nice life back in New York, but, you'll always have a home here. - Excuse me. - Whoa, now I think we bought everything that they had in the whole store. I think we bought it all. I can't believe, I think we got it all than when she was like. Thank you. - As a doctor of veterinary science, I insist you take it easy on that horse. - He's just getting some exercise. - Don't be hypocrite. Rachel's not the only Hardin with a need for speed. - Fair enough. You guys get everything you needed? - And then some. April bought a pound of rock candy. - I did that. Maybe if you're nice, I'll share some with you. - See you inside. - Thanks Rachel. - See, told you my family would fall for you. - We had a great time together. She kind of reminds me of you. - Yeah. Don't tell Mom that. - Rock candy? - I pegged you for a city slicker April Monroe, but I have to say small town life's good on you. - Yeah, well, it's kind of fun to try on for a little while. - You think about this stuff, your wedding day? - No. What, you think every woman fantasizes about her wedding day? Okay, fine. I really want like a big Barbie Dream house wedding, white silk dress with a mermaid tale, jazz quartet that would obviously cover Taylor Swift songs. And next to the wedding cake, a giant tower of rock candy. Happy? - Good to know. - Why, is that something you think about? - April, I have a surprise for you. - Surprise? - Go ahead. We all have a little work to do out here still. - Okay. - Ta-da. - What's this for? - The wedding. Winning over Mom might be easier if you looked a little more like us. This is her old dress. Still in good condition though. - Oh, I would love to wear it, but you really think that would be okay? - Why not? She can't wear it. - Do you have a mirror? - The Amish don't use mirrors. - Oh right. Well how do I look? - Naomi Trotter's gonna be shaking in her prayer cap. - Rachel, are you up there? What are you doing with that? - Oh, Rachel was gonna let me wear it for the wedding tomorrow. - You absolutely cannot. - Mom, you never wear it. - Doesn't mean you can loan it out to just anyone. Kitchen now. - Sorry April. - Sorry, April? You should apologize to your mother. This dress was not yours to give. - I wanted to help her. I like her. - You like anything English. And if you continue down this road, mark my words, it will lead you trouble. Your place is here. - Well that's for me to decide now isn't it? - Mrs. Hardin, I didn't mean to offend you. Rachel was just trying to help me blend in. - You are English, we are Amish, you will never blend in. - I'm sorry. Mrs. Hardin, are you okay? - I'm quite well, thank you. - Come here, please sit down. Could someone please get her a glass of water? Thank you. Better? Have you had many episodes like this before? Lightheadedness, trouble breathing? - A few. - And when do these usually happen to you? - Around mealtimes, I suppose. - And did all of this come on around the same time as the sore joints? - I need to get back to work. - Mom. - Mrs. Hardin, I know you probably don't wanna hear this, but I think you could have adult onset diabetes. I'd recommend running some tests as soon possible. - I'm fine. - Diabetes can be very serious if you don't get it treated. Now, if that's what this is, a doctor's probably gonna tell you to make some changes to your diet. And I'm happy to make some recommendations as well. - April. I do not think I speak more plainly when I say, I'm not interested in your medical opinions or anyone else's. Do not bring this up again. Thank you for the glass of water. - Of course. - And April, you may wear my dress tomorrow. - Thank you, ma'am. Hard to believe, my little Bruder will be a married man this time tomorrow. - I'm glad you're here, Jesse. I know you have a busy life and well thank you for making the time. - I'm never too busy for family. - I imagine wedding bells aren't too far in the future for you either. - We'll see. - Be honest, Bruder, I've seen you and April together. What are your intentions with her? - I've been carrying this around for a while? Waiting for the right time to ask her. Might just be this weekend, if that's all right with you. - Of course. April is a good woman and you have my approval. Rachel's too, I'm sure. - Appreciate that. - You know, I must admit it's bittersweet. You and I starting these new lives. Soon we'll have children that could grow up running around together, well, if we didn't live so far apart. - I didn't realize how much I'd missed this place. I'm sorry that I haven't come around more often. I hope I can change that. - No, it's okay, Bruder. We're on different paths. We've always have been. It was a passing thought. - Thank you for all your help today. I have one last request. Finish up. There's dishwashing to be done and we all should be in bed early. It's a big day tomorrow. - I can take you back to the inn. Got a new tire this morning. - Oh, that's great. Just one thing. - What? - I kinda wanna go in the buggy. - I thought it made you nervous? - It does. But it's important to face your fears. - You're right. It is. You're doing great. Just keep it tight and steady. - Tight and steady. - I'm gonna let go now, all right? - Okay. Tight and steady, tight and steady, tight and steady. This isn't so scary. - See. Take the back route, it's just right up there. - You didn't say anything about steering. - It's okay. - The view up there is almost as beautiful as the view down here. You just never see stars like this in the city. - You know, I don't know if I ever realized everything that I lost by leaving. But I've gained a lot too. - I could see myself settling down in a small town like this, someday. - Really? What about New York? - Oh, shh, just let me fantasize for a minute. I could open my own practice, one without so many patients. You could open one right next door and then we could meet every day for lunch. And after work, we could go home to an adorable little house with lots of fresh air. - Does sound pretty nice. - This has been so great. Thank you so much for bringing me here. I never would've guessed this side of you, but I love it. - April, there's something that I've wanted to ask you. - Look, a shooting star. - No, that's an airplane. - That was my next guess. My eyes must be playing tricks on me. Guess I'm more tired than I thought. Well I should probably be getting to bed. Like your mom said, tomorrow's gonna be a busy day, right? What exactly is this schedule? - There's a ceremony for the Amish. And then the English guests join for the reception. Levi got special permission for me to attend, from the Bishop, so I'll pick you up after. - I'm so glad you're gonna be there for him. What were you gonna say, before the plane? - It can wait. - Okay. Night. - Night. - Bruder, how do I look? - Amish. - Yeah. - You look great. Very respectable. She's a lucky woman. - Not as lucky as I. I'm surprised you still have your old suit, after all these years. - I'm surprised it still fits. See you. - Naomi, Daniel. - Good morning, Hardins. What a lovely day for our wedding. - Mr. Trotter. - Jesse. - You'll sit with us, won't you? You're practically family. - We'd love to. - Jesse will show you in. You too, Rachel. In you go. - You're just as I remember. Almost as if a single day, hasn't passed. - I don't know about that. - Your being here means a great deal for Levi, to all of us. - Grateful to be here and for the Bishop granting permission. - I never doubted he would. Anyone can see you're still one of us. - Shall we? - Poor Naomi. This English girl has Jesse all mixed up. I wish there was something I could do to help her. - I advise against it. We have grown children now. And as much as I'd like to see them wed, they need to decide such matters on their own. - You are right, of course. But I'm not happy about it. - Let's forget about matchmaking for today. We have another couple to celebrate, do we not? - Marriage is a lifelong commitment. I vow a love and care for you as long as we both shall live. - Marriage is a lifelong commitment. I vow to love and to care for you for you for as long as we both shall live. So, I need a second opinion. - Yeah. Do I look completely ridiculous or just a little bit? - You look fantastic. - Yeah. - Yeah. They might have recruit you for the quilted circle. You know what? You just need one more thing and I hope you don't mind that it comes from lost and found. Here you go. - Oh my goodness. How do I do it? - Just, yep, just like that. Push. Yeah. Perfect. - Okay, you have to tell a picture of this to send to May. - Oh, she's gonna flip. And there. - Let me see and I'll send it to her. - Oh. She got it. She said blink twice if you need rescuing. - Oh my gosh. You know what? That sounds like an Amish prince. Here to get his Amish princess. - Thank you, Tabby. - Yeah. Go get him girl. - Who are you and what did you do with my girlfriend? - I was thinking the same thing, except you know my boyfriend. Oh, Tabby, this is Jesse, Jesse, Tabby. - Nice to meet you, heard a lot of great things about you. - Nice to meet you Tabby. You've got a beautiful place. - Thank you, thank you. - Is that Mom's dress? - It's a long story. I'll tell you after we take a picture. Tabby, do you mind? - Oh, absolutely. - Thanks. - All right. Ready? - Yeah. - Say buggy. Buggy. - Oh, you guys look great. Here you go. - Thank you Tabby. - Thanks Tabby. - It looks great. Oh. - You look absolutely beautiful. - Congratulations Mr. and Mrs. Hardin. - April, look at you. You look like a proper Amish woman. - She'll be coming to church with us before we know it. - Well, one step at a time. - Lovely dress, April. Not bad for an Englisher. - I can't take all the credit. Had a little help. Esther, is this your dress? - It is. And I believe it suits you, April. - Jesse, April. We need more players. Are you in? - Volleyball? - Traditional Amish pastime, especially at weddings. - Well, when in Amish country? - Yes. Jesse's on my team. He's my brother. I called him first. - Is there something you're not telling me? - They're just messing around. I'm not that good. - Not that good? Here we go. All right. Ow. - Get it April. - Next. Should we have April, serve? - I don't know if April can serve. They didn't teach me that. Okay. Here we go. - Oh. - Oh. - Oh, oh, oh. - No. Nice. - Awesome. We'll get 'em next time. - You want a rematch? - Haven't you had enough? - I'm just getting warmed up. Thanks. All right, let's do it. - Somebody's thirsty. - Oh, it's not all for me. It's for the game. Had no idea Jesse was so good. - There's a lot you don't know about Jesse. - Listen, Naomi, I know you and Jesse have a history. - We've known each other our whole lives. - I understand that. But Jesse and I are together now and I would appreciate it. - It wasn't until our teens that he began to struggle, to wonder if all this was enough. - Well people change. - But do they really? You can put on the dress, ride in a buggy, stuff your face with rhubarb pie, but it doesn't change anything. It doesn't make you one of us. You think changing what he wears, what he drives, where he lives, makes him one of you? He's happy here because he's one of us. Tell me you don't see it. This English life he's chosen, it won't last. Neither will you. - You're wrong, Naomi. - Even if I am, you'll never be welcome here. So neither will he. You'll only drive him further away from the people he loves and he'll only resent you for it. And it will end in pain and misery. - Naomi. Naomi. Hey, hey, hey, it's okay, it's okay. Naomi. Naomi. - I need you to describe the pain you're experiencing. - I don't know how. - Try. - It's a sharp pain, like a knife. - Have you experienced pain like this before? - It's gotten worse, all day. - Naomi, I'm gonna push down, okay. When I press, I need you to tell me if the pain gets better or worse. All right, ready? One, two, three. There's my answer. - What are you doing to her? - I think Naomi has a appendicitis. We need to get her to a hospital right away. Can somebody call an ambulance? - Yeah, I got it. - You're gonna be okay. - Good catch doctor. We don't get any calls from this part of the county, too few actually. Ms. Trotter's lucky you're here. - I think a CT scan's gonna show that she'll need an appendectomy right away. - Of course, she's in good hands. - I'm gonna go with her. My apologies for the disruption. - No, no, go, please. God be with both of you. - Is she gonna be okay? - Appendectomies are pretty routine these days. I'm sure she'll be just fine. - Some real superhero stuff. Proud of you. - Thanks. - Is everything okay? - Yeah. - I mean, I don't know. - Hey, thanks again for your help, Doctor. We're outta here. - Wait, do you think I could ride with you? - Sure, there's room in the back. - Where you going? I thought you said she's gonna be okay. - I don't think I can do this, Jesse. - What do you mean? - I don't belong here, not really. I'm just keeping you from all of this. Your family. - You're breaking up with me? - I just, I think we'd both be better off if this ended right now. - April, we can make this work. I love you. I wanna marry you. - You coming, Doc? - I'm sorry, Jesse. - April. - Did a fly land on that? I've never seen you take so long to eat pie. - I'm not hungry. You want it? - Where's April? I haven't seen her around all evening. - She left. - For the inn? - For New York, without me. We, she ended things. - So she's gone just like that? - She was convinced that it was bound to end so better sooner than later. - Well Mom's hospitality certainly didn't help. - Don't blame Mom. - It's not, not her fault. She had it out for April ever since she got here. All because of her obsession with Naomi Trotter. - Maybe I should've told April sooner. - Why didn't you? - It's complicated. - I'm not a kid anymore, Jesse. - It's because I was afraid that this would happen. Maybe April is right. Maybe the longer that love lasts, the more that it hurts when it ends. And if I just been honest with her from the start and scared her away, it would've stung, but it wouldn't feel like this. It feels this bad now, I mean, just imagine how it'd feel two, three, 10 years down the road. - But does it have to end, like this? Will it end like this for Levi and Sarah? Did it end like this for Mom and Dad? - Rachel, the English world is different. - So there's no true love in your world? When things get hard, you just give up? Is that the English way or is that your way? - Jesse, Rachel, up, up. We need your help with some cleaning. What's wrong? - April broke up with him. - Really? - Try not to sound so upset. - Watch your tone, Rachel Hardin. - Or what? I'm a little old to be punished, don't you think? - Why are you ruining this blessed evening? It is Levi's wedding. - You ruined it first. I'm getting my things, I'm not staying here anymore. - You know what, Mom, it's one thing to drive away everyone that you love, but everyone I love. - Can I help you? - I'm here to see Naomi Trotter. - Yes, ma'am, follow me. Naomi, you have a visitor. - Esther. - I'm sorry to show up empty handed, but with your stomach being afflicted, I wasn't sure what to bring. - Oh, you didn't bring anything, Esther, your presence is more than enough. - How are you feeling? - A little tired, but I feel much better. - The doctor says she may be able to come home as soon as tonight. - That's wonderful. - These English doctors, they work miracles. Makes one feel foolish for doubting their abilities. - Where is April? - It may please you to know, she's returning to New York, alone. - Before coming here, I had some words with her. Said some hateful things, lies. I was jealous of Jesse's love for her. And I'm afraid what I said made them quarrel. If she hadn't helped me, even after the cruel things I told her, who knows what could have happened. She saved my life. - Hey. I'll be right down. - Oh, come here sis. - Thank you, I needed that. Oh, thank you for driving all the way out here. You guys must have been up for like the night. - It was no problem. Zeke's at a friend's house, the neighbor's watching Scout. - And we'd go anywhere for family, especially Amish country. Now bring on the pies and pancakes. - Right. - Yeah, so then I took a taxi back from the hospital. Thankfully Tabby was around to put up with my blubbering, half the night. - Well a girl, can use a good cry, and you had reason to. - Rob and I are happy to take you home, but I'm feeling like you're gonna regret leaving. - You stood by us when our parents didn't accept us. You convinced your parents to change their mind and their hearts. And if you could change our family's minds. - I don't know. - Why is that? - Because the Amish don't change. It's kind of their thing. Family's just as important to Jesse as it is to me. I won't make him choose. - So you're deciding for him? - It's for the best. There's no point in delaying the inevitable. It's painful enough as it is. - See you see you later, Rach. - Rachel, wait. Please, Rachel, allow me a moment. You're welcome to go after that. - One minute. - I've just been to see Naomi. She is doing much better. The doctors say she may even return home today. - You can thank April for that. - I plan to. You asked why I dislike the English. Because they took your brother Jesse. And seeing interest in their world has made me worry that I would lose another child. But the fact is you are not a child and trying to keep you close, I have only succeeded in driving you away. The English never took Jesse. He chose his own path and I must admit he chose the right path for himself. I am sorry, I haven't trusted you to make your choice. Whatever you decide, I will always love you. No matter what. - Mom, you think I can get a ride back to the farm? - Of course my dear. You are so precious. - Come back soon, Bruder. - I will. We'll miss you, Jesse. - I'll miss you too. Mom. - From your dad. Something you should have gotten a long time ago. - "Dear Jesse, it's been a long time since we have spoken, "but I felt cause today "to tell you how proud I am of your accomplishments. "Mom tells me that you've started work "at animal hospital in New York. "You don't have to choose between us son. "Our love for you is endless. "And my prayer for you is "that you find this deep love in the English world as well. "Your Dad, C. Hardin." - I'm so sorry, Jesse. So sorry that I never told you how proud your dad was of you. How proud I was of you. I wanted you to come home and. I'm sorry for the pain I've caused you. Can you ever forgive me? - I can. But there's someone else you need to apologize to also. - I know. - Well, maybe we both need to come to our senses. - Well, the recovery process won't be super fun, but on the plus side, you'll be able to eat all the ice cream you want, assuming that's okay with mom, of course. - We'll get all your favorite flavors, sweetie. - Oh, can I get my tonsils on today? - Not today, my dear. But Margo down there in reception, she'll get you guys on the calendar right away, okay. - Thank you. - Okay. - All right, I'll see you soon. Bye, bye guys. Bye. See, it's a beautiful day. - You're right. Thank you for making me get out of the office. I couldn't really tell you what season it is. - Yeah, well that's what happens when you shut yourself back in your work office and pretend like you want heartbroken. Hey, you would've done the same for me, except you would've made me run, so. - Well, thank you for sparing me that. - Yeah, well I just figured you didn't wanna be all gross and sweaty, not with Jesse here. - Hear him out. - Hi. - Hey. - I can't believe I didn't chase that ambulance. The person that I am with you is a million times more important than anyone than I was before. And I'm sorry that I didn't make you see that. I love you April. - I love you too. And I'm sorry that I left the way that I did, but I'm not willing to be the reason you can never go home. - Wherever you are, that's home. - Even if you feel that way, your family never will. - I thought you might say that. We both did. - We Amish can be hardheaded people, none more so than me. I was a fool not to see that you are a lovely, noble hearted woman and an answered prayer. My son has need of a good partner. And from time to time, I'll have need of a good doctor. April, will you forgive me? - I know it's not really customary among the Amish, but is it a okay if I hug you? - I would like that. - Oh. - April, you are the love of my life. And being with you is what's most important to me. We can figure out the rest later. Will you marry me? - Yes, of course, I'll marry you Dr. Hardin. On one condition. - Name it.
