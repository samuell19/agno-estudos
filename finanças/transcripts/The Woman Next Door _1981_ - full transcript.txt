SIDE WOMAN It was still night when the police car pulled out of Grenoble. The village is 23 km away. They also called an ambulance, and he would be there by then. ... down the road from Chambéry. My name is Odile Jouve. And if you think I'm a tennis player ... ... you are completely wrong. My face appears on the camera, but if it goes away ... ... you will immediately be aware of the situation. Come back! You see! Let's just sit there. No, better here. I'm the manager of this tennis club ... ... and here come the Grenobleians in their spare time ... ... but not just Grenoble. Everyone here knows each other. ... and I know everybody. This lawsuit started six months ago. It could be said that it started ten years ago ... ... but no, it started six months ago. Sometimes a house is the protagonist of a story. But this time, there were two houses ... ... separated by a town street. Bernard Coudray, 32, lives in the first house ... ... his wife Arlette, 28, and their son, Thomas. They are pictured here ... ... but the photo never appeared. No big deal about the second house. As you can see, no one lived in that house ... ... when it all started. Hello how are you? How are you, Thomas? -Hello! -Hello. Need some help? No thanks. Have you rented a house? No, I'm a Grenoble house agency. Mr. Bauchard is a new tenant. Philippe Bauchard. Bernard Coudray. I'm going to call by phone. Sorry, but they won't be online until next week. Come to our house. -I don't want to bother you. -Please! Come on. When moving home, things are always missing. So, very quiet, e? That's ... Please enter. Thank you. Is this our new neighbor? Yes. It will come in ten days. With his wife? I don't know if she's married. Yes, she has a wedding ring! Then we will have new neighbors. By the way... ... we will have to be careful. The garden love sessions are over. Or we will have to act in silence. No! I finished my love sessions in the garden. Whenever we make it to the grass, I chill. I don't like that at all! I finish! Wait, Thomas! Did I bring you a suitcase? Yes, if you like. From there ... Can I leave my suitcase? -Yes, leave it there. Thomas! Where are you? She would go to a neighbor's house. -Good morning. -Also white. - Do you work? -No. He is having a good time. Thomas, a friend is waiting for you to go to school. It's weird then! They are both named Thomas. What a mess! Enter. Maybe you know the house. No. -Of course, yes. -What a mess! You need to know your wife. Come on! This is often the problem with rental homes. Must be confused with the things that bring it! Mathilde, my wife. Coudray husband and wife. -Hello. -Hello. Bernard. Hello. Hello. Go before you, I'll turn the light off. Behind the trace of Thomas! Like the Indians of Arizona. Lots of Indians! Show! -Don't you wake up? -No, it's rumbling. - Is he there? -Yes. They turned off the lights at the neighbors' house. They go to bed earlier than us. Do you think the pilot's wife is beautiful? He is not a pilot, he is an air controller. Yes, he works at Grenoble airport. I drive the boats, while he himself flies. Isn't his wife beautiful? It has a touch like no other. In my opinion, it does not perform well in the landscape. What do you mean We came here to live ... Earth, trees, stones ... There are real things here. What did this woman come up with? Yes? I know you are alone. Can we talk? We can talk anytime. Of course, but I didn't want to disturb you. You know what I mean. What did you say to your wife? Did you say we know each other? And you? Did you really tell her husband? Not yet, but I'll tell her. He trusts me, he understands everything. He is a great man. I'm glad for you. See you later. Do not cut the call. Just wait! Wait ... I'm waiting. Am I really changed? On the contrary, you are the same as before. You tell me with malicious intent. I'm not necessarily coming to your life. Phillip wanted me to buy a house by surprise. If I had already come here, I would have thought of removing it from my mind. But now that it's decided, I'm happy to be here. I have to go to work. Talk to me about you. I have nothing to say. I'll give you my number. Do you have any pencils? No. I don't have a pencil. I don't need anything. Bernard ... Bernard! What's happening? Can't sleep? I was hungry. -Don't you have enough dinner? -Yes. - Then? -Good hunger, though. Also, in the dark? I'll light up. What do you have, Bernard? -You seem worried. -No. I want to propose one thing to you. Will we go on a trip for a couple of weeks? With Thomas, all three of us, on the 8th of the month or? It is not possible. Thomas can't leave school. I'll bring you an apple. Also, I have a tax check in the lab. I have a tremendous job. No, it's not possible, Bernard. Don't eat salmon. Tori apple. - Salmon is for guests. -What to invite? Forget about saying it! I invite your neighbors to dinner tomorrow. Why? He shoots ... The wife is very sympathetic. Oh my! I thought you would like them! He shoots ... Want to choose another day? Maybe we can change the day. No, it's too late to change. There is a solution ... Listen! They are cats. They are fighting. No, they are making love ... ... like the savages! Goodbye, little one. What time do you come in the evening? At eight o'clock. Good morning! -Do you wake up now? -Yes. Don't forget to shop. They will have everything ready, but ... - Don't worry! -Do not forget! No, stay calm. Wallet! Bernard, portfolio! Are you going to work? Show! The lock is locked. The doors are locked! It is closed internally. Open the back door. I will. Wait, let's see. Go ahead and try to open the door. Move! Press the red button. Thank you. Get out, get out! I'm late. Move! Remember to shop! Yes! Here's my list! Do not forget! Come to dinner today. Fifth pier! What is Bernard doing? Tori. Thomas, wait! -You won't bother, will you? -Not that. Be a joke. -Bochard. - Call me Philippe. -Philippe, do you want to sit down? -No, I sit there all day. I'm going to the kitchen. I'll come right away. I don't know what Bernard is up to. I do not understand. She stays home for hours. Sometimes he has a work dinner. ... but today, no. Your husband works in oil, right? He is a teacher of heavy vessels. They have prepared a lake for heavy tankers. Bernard teaches the captains with the models. -Models? Like the kids? -No, indeed. They are not children's toys. They are large scale models, by themselves. Yes, 1/25 scale. It will therefore be the size of a barge. That's it. What will he do? It will be him! Yes Dad? Leave me. Bernard? What's happening? Oh no! You have to warn me. It's Bernard. Don't wait. It has a drawback. Try to come for dessert. Fine. We'll have dinner without Bernard. Come first. Yes. See you later. You must tell me to turn away, because I have lied to you. It's the brand then! Yes, I lied. I told him I was in the workplace. I'm not a fan of lies. It was very compelling. I can tell you everything now. Buy my silence with a bourbon. Fine. -What will you take? -I do not know. I'll see. -I will prepare you. -Yes, get out of here, liar. No, no, no. Well, I'll explain. They rented our side house. And Arlett, in a hurry, invites new residents to dinner. -You don't like it. - No, on the contrary! But I'm slow. Slow! I need time to get used to it. You know what happens: today for dinner at our house ... -... and then we go back to their house ... -The start of the gear. How do they work? Are they native? The man is an air controller at Grenoble Airport. He is a quiet man. Like a British patriot. And the lady? I don't know ... He looks like a dark person. One of those women looking for the moon at noon. Do you understand? No. If you don't have dinner at home, have a meal with me. No, no. -No one will ever come. -I just need a sandwich. Sandwiches as well! We will eat cooked beef. But first, I'll give Benito something to eat. Oh, Mrs. Jouve! -Did you take me? -No, but help me. Do you know that I have been successful with prosthetics? In Grenoblast, a man followed me. I changed direction on the pedestrian crossings. Finally, he spoke to me. I had to endure it for 10 minutes. -He was a fetishist. -I'm not surprised. I saw a movie about it. A woman feared men would embrace her. He couldn't bear that. To please him, a man cut his arms. - Both? -Yes. Well, I don't know ... one or both. In any case, he did it out of love. -I also did it for love. -Are you? Out of love? -I thought it was by accident. - "By accident" in quotes. Don't forget the quotes, young man. What did they tell you? That you fell from the 8th floor window. From the 17th floor! And, thankfully, a stained glass window seemed to slow you down. That's right. In the old part of Nice. Below was a workshop. If that window hadn't been there, I wouldn't be here with you now. These are old accounts. They will be 20 years old next year. The military struck Algeria at the time. As old as I am, I can tell you the truth, because you seem kind. I did not fall, I threw myself, like dirty clothes. -You were kind, at least. -Kena had nothing to do with it. I was disappointed. In love and disappointed! He went to New Caledonia leaving me there, waiting, you fool! I learned later that he was married. So neither one nor two, drum! What did he say when he heard that you did that? He was sure he didn't know anything, so much the better. Yes, it's true. People don't like to know things like that. Men are right. It was a tragic end to my story, but not a deadly one. Now I'm like Edith Piaf: "I'm sorry for nothing." What do we have? Have you left? No, no. I'm listening to you. I'm glad you came ... ... but I'm sorry Bernard wasn't there. It doesn't matter. It turned out very well. It's true. Next time in our house? Fine. Gabon, Mathilde. -Gabon, Arlette. -Gabon, Philippe Hello, cat. Will I put you in tight if I help you? I don't know about you, but I had a great dinner. Your wife made us an amazing dinner. We talked a lot about you, of course. Do you have a car in the parking lot? Good thing: this dinner was arranged without me asking. It may be, but we are now neighbors in a 7-8 home town. So anyways ... And besides, we're adults, right? You have a good boy, Bernard. It looks like yours. -You'll be happy ... -Yeah, I'm glad. I was glad until you suddenly showed up. We need to talk, Bernard. I don't want you to eat your guilt, but ... ... I can remind you that you passed me red. Come today, come tomorrow ... Come on, you can't bear me ... ... and after 8 days you couldn't live without me! I had the courage to leave you, because I would be mad otherwise. As we both have done well, be a better friend, right? Yes, you are right. I hate myself for the harm done to each other. Baboon! I'm glad you're doing well. I liked that. We invite you to dinner next week. So don't pepper. Do you speak to me? I speak to you. You will be there for me, little bitch. - Will you give me a message? -Yes. I want to ask you another thing too. Say my name when or where. I immediately noticed the hostility ... ... because you could spend the whole day without calling me "Mathilde". You won't remember. Mathilde. Mathilde! Mathilde! Can you drive? Look closely, Thomas. Look, Mom. When I see beautiful hair, I have to touch them. The tanneries in particular. That hair is too much. Right? In the club or in life? In both. It is for film and television. And because of the publicity, it has an unfortunate impact. -Do you come? -Hello, Odile. -Do you come by road? -Yes. -Will you stay till night? -All weekend. -I have taken a room in La Pérgola. -Did you go crazy? Call to cancel the room. You will sleep in my house. Fine. Jean-Luc, I have to call! That guy is pure treasure. Thanks for existing! It's a golden treasure! You don't know how much I owe you. Sorry, I didn't introduce you to each other ... ... I'm not aware of your name. Mathilde Bauchard. I'm Bernard's neighbor. Of course! I'm sorting it out in my head. However, you don't seem to be looking for the moon at noon. Why? -What do we have, Philippe? -Roland! Are you -I was in doubt because of his beard. -For the beard and the years! -How long? 4 years? -5, I think. This is wonderful! Mathilde! I will introduce you to Roland Duguet. We were in the same group at the Corsica Rally. -This is Mathilde. -Good, Miss. - Andrea. -It's my wife. There! Congratulations. I was playing with Mathilde. Keep talking. I'll be alone for a while. Isn't it difficult to be an editor on the provincial side? No. It has more advantages than problems. -I was born in Paris. -Don't talk to me! It's true. We were talking about it. I find it hard to talk. Mathilde is very beautiful. I thought he was Italian. No, it's French, southern. Seeing me back then, I realized it would be important to me. I have never sought the ideal woman. Not even looking for a woman. But knowing Mathilde, I understood that it was a kind of promise. No, without fear of saying a word. ... I thought it was his last chance to be happy. Mrs. Jouve, please. - Mrs. Jove? -He's there. -I'm looking for Mrs. James. -Ask the server. Mrs. Jouve, please? Mrs. Jouve? Thank you. - Can you help them? -No. You are so kind. I saw you and I was shocked. Yes! I received a dirty telegram. But I will do the ignorant. -Go. -If you can help me ... No. Come on, leave me. Go on. -If you don't need to say so. -Yes. As Philip told me, you say you make children's books. It's propaganda for me, but it's not so much. You are born, but you do not trust yourself. I wrote some texts, then drew them, but for mere hobbies. I would be interested. I want some books out. What kind of drawings are they? Without borders or ...? No, everyone has an edge, 2 or 3 points. I use Chinese ink and colored ink. But never more than four colors, so you can do it in four-color. Do you call it pure hobby? No. I took a 3 month course in Okapin, but a long time ago. I had to leave because I was sick. Things are so modernized in publishing houses ... Technique, yes, but well-told stories will always be needed. I'm very interested to see what you do. You have no players. Do you want to play a game with me? No, I hurt my wrist. Excuses. Are you okay? I am. Tomorrow at 6, Station 37 Street. Do not forget. At 37 Station Street at 6 p.m. I booked a room. I'm Bernard Coudray. Yes, room 18. The key is not in the table. You're waiting for someone. There! The first one? Sir! Here it is. Come on, sir. This is such a mess! I knew you were like this. -No, it was shorter. -No, you're smaller. No, fool! The fashion was shorter. You won't even remember our first reunion, right? Yes that's it. It was at your grandmother's snack. I came from the garden and saw you inside the house. From the window box you were preparing slices of bread. That's why I immediately fell in love with you. Suddenly! And to say you loved me, you got drunk. And you said, "I'm not drunk." ... as evidenced by the rigor of my reasoning. And forget to kiss and reason me! Ixo, Ixo. Slap me in the face. - Wait, wait. -I'm waiting. What is that? Do you think this makes sense? That's my point. It matters to you five, my friend! I am not your friend, but your lover, a former lover. When my lover had a spine, he had a spit. And when the shell was broken, it hurt Mathilda. It is true that I was a fool. For a long time, deep down. But not now. I have changed a lot. It's true. You have changed. It was too early. If we had come together now, it could have gone well. In fact, we have come together now! It's not the same. It's not the same. You are more beautiful than before. It's true. We were too young, but now we are fine. I don't think so and I'm not looking for it. -We loved each other! -I loved you ... ... you were in love. It's not the same. And you were too skeptical, always questioning me. Of course! You said, "I love you, because I love you." Isn't that a good enough reason? And you loved women too much, sir! I thought horrible things were going on underneath the skirts. And now what do you think? Sometimes. -You were crazy. -You too. - Wait, wait. -I'm waiting. Look! It looks like a battlefield. You have hair in your eyes. It is not true. I wanted to see you make that gesture. The first time you did that, I told myself ... "If I ask him to go to bed, I will say yes." I would rent this room for a month. For what? We can come whenever we want. I don't like making others love our bed. Air Inter 325, approaching from the right. To the B-1 parking lot. Mr. Bauchard, they are asking about you below. I have come to the aid of Mrs. Jouve, who must take the plane. So I brought this for Mathilde. -What is? -You were right. I will be playing tennis this week. I told Odile that I would take care of the place. It looks incredible! Odile goes to Grenoble for a few days. A big kiss to Mathilde. Have you heard? I'm not being polite. Give him a big kiss. Have a good time in Paris. I'm going to take care of your plane. Will you launch us? No big crap, please! Everything is well thought out. I would not be surprised if the text was also calibrated. I thought so, anyway. "Here again ..." Mr. Roland! The man at the bar wants to talk to Mrs. Jouve. I told him he was away, but he didn't believe me. -This morning came. -I will talk to him. I'll come soon. When I arrived this morning, it was already there. It seemed like something, I don't know what it was. It's a very strange thing. That man ... don't turn around ... ... Odile Jove is said to have come to see ... From where? Especially from New Caledonia to see Odile! Oh yes? From New Caledonia? He said he was coming. If so, Odile would not go out the same day. It's there. Do you all want coffee? No, not me. I don't drink coffee at night. Three coffees, Mathilde. Let's not forget the sugar. Come here. -Thursday at 6 o'clock in our hotel. -No. Yes. I need to be with you and talk to you. I told you no! Bernard, take the cups. There is coffee here. We'll sit there for coffee. -Get there. -Thank you. How has this room changed since last time. -We've had a little time. -The ground fire is excellent. Yes. The piano, on the other hand, bothers. In my opinion, no. Sugar. -What is that? -Your gift. -My gift? -After I wanted to give you, but ... Is this your birthday? You had to tell us! It's not my birthday. -No, it's a gift of separation. -Finance? I'm leaving for three days tomorrow and Mathilde doesn't want to come. The house is not supposed to be well maintained yet. What the heck he'll do! Put the piano on the first floor or! - For fear of opening the gift? -I'm eager. I guess that's what I guess. As we walked, Mathilde liked this dress. I pushed her into the store, she tried on the dress ... I saw that it was impossible to wear, at least not publicly. No! It's pretty cool. And it's not a shame at all. -No, it doesn't seem that way, but ... -Dress! You will have three opinions. -Good idea. Dress it up. -No right now. -Yes! -Do you want to help? - That's fine. -I'll help you. -Let's go up. - Fine. From here. Listening to Mathilde is a big thing for me. When I met her, she was just as beautiful now. ... but he didn't laugh; sometimes a smile. Now that's fine. -He is newly divorced ...-Divorced? Yes. Urgent divorce after a hasty marriage. -What's happening? Have you heard? -Yes. It's on the street, somewhere. Do such things happen frequently here? Sometimes. When a house is empty for a long time ... When I went, I would leave a light on. The neckline is fine. Transparencies, perhaps ... Oh, it's wonderful! I sure did. I told you so too. I'm the only one, somewhere, who doesn't look scandalous. Mathilde will wear it when you're not, Philippe. When he wants, he will wear whatever he wants and where he wants. I'm not a Spanish husband. Will you help me pick up the cups, Bernard? Yes Yes. Do you know this new store? In keeping with tomorrow. At 6am you will have me waiting for you. Hello. I don't see the key to the 18th. You are not the first today. You have to wait. What's happening? Come on. Come on. Listen, Bernard. You wanted to talk. We can talk below. No. Talk in the room. No, no. I know you and I know myself. I don't like taking advantage of Philippe being away. I'm looking for sugar. There is no sugar. - Are you looking for something? -No, no. Sugar! Will you leave me? Thank you. What is that marriage issue? Not with Philippi, with the previous one. -You left and got married? -Yes, to get rid of you. Forget about you. I decided to marry the first man who would ask me sweetly. And Patrick was such a fool. - Was he a fool, too? -Yes, a happy fool. Even though I knew it was a failure, I had to get married. Like the man in the story: He married the first woman he saw! I wanted to get married and get divorced the next day. But he introduced himself to his family, and I felt trapped. It took me six months to leave. Then I lived alone until I met Philippe 2 years ago. She has been strong, resourceful and charming. He knows how to wait and trust me. And then what did you do to the British phlegm? At first, he told me this about you ... ... - the truth is that he loves you - ... one of the things that stayed inside said to me: "Mathilde was in a hurry and badly married ... ... to forget a previous relationship ... " Listen to me well: "Relationship with a Cyclothymic and Violent Man." I am a cyclothymic and violent man. Is that how you talk to me about others? It has simplified it, it has messed up everything. -Simplified. -Simplified ... Let's forget this. Listen to me and look closely. Why don't we just throw everything in the air and make a leg up? We should be happy. 8 years ago, you couldn't see me in the eye. You fooled me. I loved you so much. But I was going to die before I pointed that white. Then why didn't you say anything? When I was pregnant, why didn't you want a child? You told me this was not possible! What you thought was wrong, you had to wait. I expected you to tell me the opposite. By all means, you wanted a child, but not with me. And you had a child with another woman. No, we better not see each other anymore. -Take me home. -No, Mathilde. I have no kisses. Will you leave me yours? Yes, tori. -No, it's dirty. -I love you. Leave me alone. Are you better? Don't you cry? Tori musotherapy. Now it's dirty. -Thank you, my dear. -What did I hear? Yes, you are my favorite. You will always be my favorite. Even if you don't want to. Slight. No, no. I liked it, but it won't be repeated again. Bernard, Thomas, for dinner! If the soup is hot, blow it away. Not too hot? -What did you do today? -Ixo! I hear nothing! What do you want to hear? It is a running engine. What did you do at school in the morning? I'm cold. I'm looking for a sweater. I saw one in the living room just below. Not here. I'm going up there looking for a sweater. Can you replace me for a couple of hours? -What do you have? -Nothing. -Are you sick? -No, but I can't stay. Put someone in my place. Hi Mr. Coudray. You were not signed today. It's taken 18th, but I can give you another one. -Can I call by phone? -Yes, from here. - Yeah? -Mathilde, I am. -Where are you calling? From the hotel. - From the hotel? -Our hotel. What are you doing there? I was in the car ... and I thought ... "Come here, Mathilde." I can't. Yes, come with me. Remember what I said to you in the car? Come, anyway. No, I can't. -Don't you or don't you want to? -No one and not the other. Don't you realize what we say to each other in discussions? We do not discuss it! We don't even have time to talk. -Are I free in the evening? -No, I can't this evening. -Is your husband back? No, what? -Where did you stay yesterday afternoon? -Yesterday evening? I used to do some accounting in my book. Do nothing by day, and work with your book at night! It was not at night, but in the evening. Don't tell me about it! At 8.10am there was a light in your house, at 8.20am you were driving. Yesterday afternoon I showed him drawings at Roland! Bernard, are you still there? Don't you answer? Won't Rolandez be jealous? She doesn't like women. -I don't believe you. -Do you not believe me? I can't believe a word! It is equally important to me whether you believe it or not. I don't want to see you anymore. -Mathilde ... -You are afraid. I would like an explanation. Now I fear you? Don't get it wrong. I said that because I was nervous. You asked for my phone because you were nervous. I begged you for your phone because of your drowning. You can't treat me like a cop and you're a thief. Don't stay there in a clash. Enter. Yes, you are right. We are talking about everything or nothing all the time. Sit down. With this fatigue, if I sit down, I will fall asleep. -There is something else. -What? What have I done to you? I hate the lie, but if we're together ... ... I live by lies. At first I meant everything to Philip, but I couldn't. I couldn't. You see we can't go on like this. Within a week, Philippe and I will be traveling. And that's why I couldn't go to the hotel. Remember what you said 8 years ago? Oh, what a shame you gave me when I said this: "Love stories have a beginning, middle and end." -It was true. -Yes, you're right. You are absolutely right. I'll calm down. You won't have to complain about me in the future. We will be friends, as before. Friends like before ... When before, though? I have to go home. What if Arlett sees you coming out of here? -I don't know .. I'll tell you ... -You fixed the fridge. Yes, I will say that. No, I'm going to say I'm better, I'm breathing! I'm taking a deep breath. Here's our Thomas! Wait, I'll swing you. -What are you doing? -What a question! In the kitchen. No, no. No kitchen tonight. Caroline will take care of Thomas and take you to Grenoble. Cinema, restaurant, party tonight! A cup of coffee, and a little pattar for me. I'm glad to see you relaxed again. I'm always quiet. No. These last few weeks have been tremendous. It seemed like you wanted to be alone. My mother called Thomas and I at Chambery. -You can calm down. - That's not it! All three of us go on vacation, that's what I want. A real vacation. Relax. Look at who he is. -Well! -You got out of the house! -How are you? -Well, what about you? Not to be in Paris 20 years ago! He is hell. People are hysterical. I will sit here, in front of Mrs. Jouve. -The chef is gone. -She says. Take out two salads. He is nervous. When he sees the suitcases, he goes crazy. -Our home away from home? -Yes, we went to the cinema. -What did you see? - "The Walking Dead." -It's about crimes. -I think I've seen it. She is from a jealous husband who suspects his wife. He suspects it in vain, because his wife is a mere saint. Quickly, but the young lover eventually kills her husband. No! Her husband kills herself, as if it were a murder. That's what I saw! He is also very cunning. Husband puts knife in front of door. And he puts a knife in his head. The knife falls into the living room and the corpse into the next room. So he knew his wife would be accused of being a murderer. -The first news! -Work in a room ... ... and the corpse in the other: it's a suicide in disguise. They explain it at the end of the movie. Haven't you heard? -Yes Yes. -You would think about the ships. He was losing attention, anyway. Need a drawing board ... ... as you become a professional. Roland mentions a man from Grenoble. Do you want to go? No, I'm gonna go. If your boy was yellow-haired, he would look like the boy next door. Mine has black hair. It's a weird thing, then, the picture! I want to throw all my own and keep yours. I am classified: school, institute, university ... Each photo brings me closer to you. Tell me, Mathilde ... Did you and Bernard know each other? - Look. -You are right. He is. I saw it once, the day they took this picture. I remember my cousin Bernard being crazy. And did Bernard love the girl too? Then why didn't they get married? The cousin's father loved his daughter immensely. When asked about Bernard, he told his daughter: "You see, but this guy is easy to reach and impossible to keep." Do you love me? Will you always protect me? Come to Thomas for the picture. Mathilde, put yourself in the picture too. Get close to Bernard. 773 Seeing? We are friends. We couldn't tell you first. Smile! Dear friends, listen to me for a while. Relax, I won't give you a talk. ... but I'll tell you why we met. In two hours, Mathilde and I set off for the sun. ... you know that, but you don't know it's a honeymoon. If we got married and came here, we couldn't do it ... ... that ritual that will make us a complete husband. That's why we invited you to this little party. It's wonderful. The two seem young in love. They will take off at 6 p.m. I'll take them to the airport. -Tori water. -Thank you. I'm depressed! - Sit down. -No, sit down. Let me sit on you for a while. Mathilde, you are very good at this photo ... ... but Bernard appears to be black. I want to take a picture of you with Philip, but he is not. Yes, it is there. I'll go find him. No, leave the camera and help fix the dress. -Do you want to help? -No, Nicole will come with me. I should have dressed this way, but I didn't think so. -Mathilde, the phone! - For me? - Yeah? There is none. -Yes, I am. I want to see you alone. We will meet at the hotel immediately. -It's not possible. -Yeah, in the car! I need to talk to you. That's what you always say. And then ... nothing! I don't ask for much! We don't have time to talk! -Don't talk so loud. -I'll talk as loud as I like! Don't go to Philippi today. Postpone the trip for a few days. I have to tell you one important thing! -Put off in peace! You are crazy! - Use it! Get out of here! Leave me, Bernard! You are crazy. Free me! I want to kiss you! Mathilde! Mathilde! It's crazy! Leave me! Leave me! You're angry with me, aren't you? You will hate me. No. I'm not angry with you. I don't hate you. It would take you a long time to get there. And yet I am inevitably jealous. I am jealous of Mathildez, for you, and especially for your suffering. In fact, you don't trust me at all. I don't know ... We had something to say ... Say what? What should I say to you? Did the neighboring tanner fool me 8 years ago? Why not? Because I thought I would be out of my head in 8 years. When they came here, I didn't think I'd see them so often. Seeing someone who has been important to us in life is no joke. Worst of all, Mathilde has always been angry with me. From the beginning I saw many things that I didn't like at all. I do not understand. No, I don't understand. Arlette, come to me, please. Yes, Mathilde was an eight year old girl. That girl and I have never been to each other. -We were bad for each other. - Damaging, not a few! Yes, harmful! I thought it wasn't worth talking about. And we won't talk anymore. It's over. I finish! 838 Arlette! Arlette! Are you sick? What do you have What do you have, Arlette? Guess. Yes. You've made tremendous progress in a few weeks. Thanks to Roland. You're talking about my drawings, but you have something else on your mind. Yes. I remember how we are going to live above all. I asked Mrs. Jouve to find a home. In Grenoble, perhaps. Mrs. Jouve is a complete benefactor. Do you know what he did last month? One of his former lovers lives in New Caledonia. ... he came to see Grenoble. Mrs. Jouve went to Paris to avoid being with the man. Because he did not want to appear old in front of the other. It is not true. It's a lie! This man from New Caledonia was Odile Jove's only love. He threw himself out the window 20 years ago. The man never knew what had happened. He did not know that Mrs. Jouve was disabled. Mrs. Jouve is an extraordinary woman. And this man has never understood anything. And I haven't understood anything. Men do not understand love. They are mere amateurs in that. I love you just like you, but I don't understand you. I never lied, because that is too complicated. And this is where I live with a liar ... ... I sleep with a liar, and I love with a liar. And I love a liar. Come on, Mathilde. - Tell me, what's my name? -What? -How's my name! -Philippe, have you gone mad? My name is Philippe? Why do you say another name while sleeping? Want to know what your name says at night? No. -Hello. Do you know me? -Of course. 18.a. Can I rent room 18 on a monthly basis? It can't be. It is a newspaper; otherwise, the hotel would be an apartment. -I'm sorry. -I understand. Sorry. Goodbye. You have reversed this drawing. It's a mistake. No. I did it deliberately. It will be on the right page. Suspension cannot be inward, but outward. - Fine, yes. -Are you okay? No? I'm tired. I really like your writing. If you make more books, I would like to print your writing. You might. -Sorry! - Don't apologize. We have a blood stain problem here. The boy fell. The drawing is very nice ... ... but the blood stain is too heavy for young readers. So I prepared a variant. You're wrong! I did this drawing to show the blood stain. Without a blood stain, this image makes no sense. You're exaggerating! That drawing is morbid. Look closely at the variant. It doesn't betray you. Fine. I'm tired. I have to go home. Goodbye. Then will I call you home? All right. -Hello, Thomas. How are you? -Well. I'm thirsty. Can I go home? -If you like, yes. -You will help me? Yes. - Can I give a forest water? -Yes. -You want? Are you not thirsty? -No. You have a beautiful home. What a nice kitchen! I would love to see your room. Will you take me? - Will you show me the house? -Yes. Where is your room? - It's nice. -Come to see my toys. What are you doing How nice this drawing is! -What is? -The wailing weeping. -Why is the whale crying? -She's sad. Do you know what sadness is? Is this the first time you have published a book? Yes, this is the first time. Well, no ... three years ago ... Yes, yes. -Is this your first book? -Yes. Nicole, are you there? Will you write me an offer for my niece Marie-Christine? He is very good. Too thin for children. What do you say then? You're exaggerating! What's happening? Don't stop here! Come with me! What happened to you? Oh my! Donuts are burnt to me! Do you know how to use it? -You got tired? -No, I'm fine. Wait. -You got dirty. -Here! Go clean up a bit. Jacques! What a treat! -I don't know what Marcel is doing! -If I haven't seen it in a month. Didn't you mention the yellow hair of his house? Yes, he was enthralled with it, and very fond of it. Now she wants to remove the girl. I do not understand you. What's the matter? He finds her every day in the elevator and needs to treat her sweetly. Now he understands that he should never go to bed. ... with the neighbor next door. Marcel demonstrates! Are you the lady who wrote the book? - Will you sign me? -Later. Look, I'm in love. Where is Mathilde? -Don't you see Mathilde? -No. Roland, haven't you seen Mathilde? I haven't seen it in a while. No, I haven't seen it. -You saw my wife? -He was walking. I'm looking for Mathilde. -Mathilde! -I saw it first! What's happening? Mathilde, what do you have? What do you have, nice? Answer me. Your husband will come to visit you. No. This cannot be continued. That he cannot continue to do so. To start, you need to eat. You've slimmed down. I'm slim, I'm ugly, I'm junk. I have to die. I don't know what happens to me. When you see your husband, you will improve. No. I would like to understand ... I would like to understand, understand! Unlike many people, depression is a disease. Healing is even more difficult if the patient does not want to heal. On the contrary. If your wife wants it, she might come out next week. But he doesn't want to. He prefers to be sick; made that choice. Then what will you do? I will prove this to your wife: Damage to the disease is damaging. Tell me: what or what did you notice, or ...? He hit the ground. There is no other word: it has hit the ground. There were some signs, though. There was a lot of traffic in Grenoble last week. ... and he repeated to me, "Where are all these cars going?" I'm coming at 6am to find you. Good to hear you, Thomas. - Sure. - Sure. Bernard! I want to talk to you. You know well that I don't like accessing accounts other than mine. But I have to talk to you Mathildez. No, I don't want to hear about that person. I'll talk to you anyway. I've been to the clinic with him. That guy is in room 36. It will be good to see you. Go talk to him. Heal that account. I've known Mathilde much more than you before. If anyone can help me, it's not me. You are wrong. You have done well, not himself. Okay, don't worry about it. -You called me? -Yes, you ask someone. -Who is? -I don't know, don't give me a name. I explained everything to you. You know how old I am. Do what you want. But when I knock on the door and enter his room ... ... just look at Mathilde's face ... ... to understand that it is not waiting for me. - Here it is. -Thank you very much. Good afternoon, Mathilde. Do you want to stay here? Do you want to go? Neither one nor the other. - Good afternoon, Thomas. -Also white, Dad. -Good afternoon. -Also white. Ask me why I'm late. Why are you late? Philippe Brouchard came to the lake. She told me to go see Mathilde again and again. He is in a clinic, recently released from a sleep treatment. Yes, I knew. Is it better? Doctors wanted him to have an electroshock, but Philip refused. He is right. It gives way to forgetful things, but leaves traces. It would be nice to see you, right? I tried to talk to him, but he didn't answer me. I told Philip that I will go again. But I don't think it's worthless. If I were you, I would go. In these cases, there is no knowing what is good and what is not. The man who loved him with great passion ... ... and when he learned that the man was going to New Caledonia ... ... he decided to wait all the time he needed. And then I decided to kill my mother! What? I wanted to make sure you were listening. I will start again with Mrs. Jove's story. When she learned that her lover was married in New Caledonia ... ... 7. he opened the window of the floor, and threw himself. It crashed through the glass window of the restaurant below. It was 20 years ago. Now he has a prosthesis on his right leg. What do you say about that? That lady was very lucky. -Do you call it fate? -Yes, it's luck. He has been lucky to live. Lucky to love another man, maybe. Life is more imaginative than we know. There may be many who are both beloved and lover. To be loved, one must be kind. And I am the next of the pure. There is something in me that scares people. Your husband did not scare you. My husband loves me. It's just like you. He pretends to be listening. He tells me to turn the page. Don't know if this page weighs 100 pounds! No, no one is interested in me. You, of course, are paying for it. If what the books say is true ... ... I was in love with you now. And yet, I don't feel any influence. The treatment must be worse. Silence, don't talk. Instead of the nurse, change the batteries to the radio. There are new piles behind you. Mrs. Bouchard, medication. These tablets are truly exceptional. This makes you hungry. This gives you 5 hours of sleep. The other one makes you happy. Take two, and you burst into laughter in bed. You should try it. No. I'm fine. Do you think that? -What is Mrs. Jouve like? -Very well. When you come to see me, you are suddenly bored. No, by no means. Radio is on. I'm glad you are interested in what's going on in the world. No. I can only hear the songs. They tell the truth and. The more stupid, the more real. By themselves, they are not stupid. What do they say? They say, "Don't leave me," "Your absence has broken my life." "I am an empty house without you, let your shadow remain." Or "without love, there is nothing." Come on, Mathilde ... I need to go. I'll be back. Don't worry, Bernard. You don't have to come. Say: "The task is over. The era is normal again." Thomas! Let's go home. -Good day, Philippe. -Also white, Arlette. -Have you found a home? -No, an apartment in the middle. -Mathilde is better? -Yes, much better. It has been revived. FOR RENT Hi Mathilde. Today is the big day. I have been to the doctor and everything is fixed. Fine. Do not forget about the shoes. -My favorite shirt. -It's torn; I bring blue. Even torn, I prefer to wear white. Because it's white. You brought me rain too. What do you prefer to wear a flat skirt or a flared skirt? I like the pleated skirt a lot. Take me, my dear. I need to talk to you. Wait. Come on. It was a clear day for police to arrive ... ... and the ambulance was already there. Anda carriers entered the house at two o'clock. The forensic doctor stated: We found the bodies of a man and a woman lying. Man on woman, legs on woman. Behind the ears, he has a bullet hole, with salt blood. The woman's face has an identical wound. ... made with a woman's arm still in her hand. The woman is lying on her back, her legs open, her skirts raised. His head is turned to the window of the garden. The death occurred at about 5:30 p.m. Given the attitude of their bodies, it is worth thinking about ... ... that they have had sexual relations beforehand. The bodies of Mathilde and Bernard will not be buried in the same grave. If I had to choose one of these two writing dead ... ... I would put this: "Not with you, not without you." But they will not ask my opinion. SUBTITLES: Jon Muñoz
