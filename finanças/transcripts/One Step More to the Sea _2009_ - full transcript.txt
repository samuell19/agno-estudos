This time it's class four. Yes. You didn't sleep in this class last time. What matters is that, I'm dead if I sleep during the college entrance exam. - Mom. - What? Can't you buy me a bicycle? No. Would you at least pretend to have given it some thought? How could you say no right away? It's not the first time you've asked. I'll ride it only to school It isn't that far away. Be quiet. Don't you know why I'm saying no? You're being over-protective! Study hard. - I'm going. - Bye! What bad luck in the morning. The map of the eight provinces written during the King Sejong period and the East Nation map written during the King Sejo period were made. What map is more important? It's The Dongguk-Yeojiseungram a geographical history book written during the King Sungjong period There are transportation routes topography and more... The Shinjeung-Dongguk-Yeojiseungram the revised edition, is more important. Concerning the Dokdo Island debate... The Sejong-Sillok map and the Shinjeung-Dongguk-Yeojiseungram both serve as historical evidence showing that Dokdo Island belongs to Korea. It became a model book of compiled geography later as the accuracy of the text, gripped each area's uniqueness and it mentioned industries intensively. During the Chosun Dynasty... Where did I leave off? Why, was the compiled map important? To develop civilization... Want a ride to the bus stop? No thanks. Okay. Good night. Good night, Mom. It's delicious, Madam Seo. I cooked it. Did you? Yeah, something was missing. Don't eat it. No, it tastes good. Our Mrs. Hong is fit to get married now. How dare you talk to your mother that way! Aren't I right, Madma Seo? You grow up first if you want to marry your mother off. Okay. If you press it like this... It becomes like this. Then scratch this... apply water... You can design whatever you want. This is the list of the group projects. Pass it around. For those who didn't sign up, I've assigned you anyway, so no complaining. For those who didn't sign up, Assigned you anyway, so no complaining. Report on sunrise & sunset Jung Ga-eul, Kim Won-woo, Kang Joon-suh. I can go myself, so why do you always pick me up? Who else would come besides your mother? Did you sleep at school? But you took your medicine in the morning... You didn't sleep well last night? It's not that. Do we have a camera at home? A camera? Why? I got caught up in a weird group project. Really? Shall I ask your teacher to take you off of it? No. Stop coming to school. It's embarrassing in front of everyone. Is Tae-young doing okay at school? She's excited about not hearing her mom's nagging that's for sure. Tae-young must be happy studying abroad. How is Won-woo doing? Is there any medical cure for narcolepsy? No. She's not supposed to laugh or run. No one knows the cause of it or any cure. It's so upsetting. Won-woo should go to a good university for the sake of her mom. I'm not asking for anything from Won-woo. All I want is for her to go to school as a healthy and ordinary student. Hey! Stop looking at him. It's embarrassing. Look at his butt. It's pretty, huh? What if it is? Are you going to touch it? I'd love to. A few days ago I saw my husband's rear in the bathroom and it was so saggy. Suddenly I hated the thought of living with an old man. You should be happy about growing old together. Living together with someone who remembers you when you were young is happiness. Hey, it's not easy for people to think that way. Do feelings change along with our bodies? I won't feel like an old lady if I don't look in the mirror. I wish I could date a young guy like that. Stop it! Did you drink a lot? You're a mother. Shame on you. Stop nagging me. I haven't drunk in a long time. What about Sae-young? I asked my mother to come home. Let's hurry. Yeun-hee, get in. I'll give you a ride. No thanks, it's the opposite way. It's close by taxi. I'll take you home. No thanks. I'm okay. - Be careful. - I'll come over with Sae-young later. Okay. You look great. I'm teaching photography class in the next room. Here it is. This place is as old as my house. This camera is very old. There's also film inside it, but it can't be used since it's old. This camera will cost a lot to fix. How much? About $300. Why don't you buy the latest digital camera instead? Yes, Mom. Where am I? I'm near your work. School ended early. Okay. Would you like something to drink? No thank you. Mom. You're here. Wait a minute. I'll go get my purse. Okay, hurry. Is that a digital camera? I have a digital camera and a film camera. Do you take pictures? No. Isn't that a camera? It's broken. Let me take a look at it. I'll check if I can fix it. This camera seems much older than you. It belongs to my dad. This is your last exam before you become a senior. Are you doing well on your group projects? Yes! Each group prepare well, and don't cause any havoc. That is all. Class president. - Attention, bow. - Thank you! Report on Sunrises and Sunsets. Here you go. Wow, it's entirely new. Do you know how to take a picture? Hold it steady with your right hand and use your left hand to focus. Try it. Turn the lever first. And then the object will come out clearly in the middle. Hold your breath. Press it. Is it done? Try once more. These were the photos inside the camera. Your father must have taken them. This house is too old. A lot needs to be fixed. It's too uncomfortable for us to live in. If we agree to the reconstruction, then we'll live in a nice new apartment. I'm not leaving. If you want it, you go on alone. Would you at least pretend to have given it some thought? You're the same. What? I don't get why people remember others' mistakes, but not their own. Don't interfere when grown-ups are talking. You always do what you want. Jung Ga-eul. This phone is turned off. You can leave a message after beep... - You can't go today! - Don't be ridiculous. Ga-eul! Stop where you are! Just download the information from the net! Damn you! Am I ridiculous now? Okay, let go of me first. Hey! Isn't that my camera? For someone who falls down a lot, why did you run like that? The first fairy prayed that the princess be full of intelligence. The second fairy prayed for her to become a beautiful woman. It was the third fairy's turn. But then, an uninvited fairy rushed in. She said, "The princess will die from the spinning wheel." And then she disappeared. Then the third fairy stepped forward and said, "I pray that the princess falls into a deep sleep instead." The King ordered every spinning wheel in the country to be burned. - Won-woo. - Why? It's boring? Then were you also cursed by a bad fairy? Princess Aurora grew up beautifully with the blessings of the good fairies. Since she was so nice and... - Sae-young, come over again. - Bye, Yeun-hee. Mom. Does magic really exist? What are you talking about? The Sunkyukwan, the central educational center, and the Hyangkyo, the district one, were national educational institutes during the Chosun dynasty. They will be in the final exam so write them down. Next. You seem sick, so go home early today. No, I'm okay. You come to school to study, not to sleep. Tell your mom to take you home early. Can you go to college like that? Where did I leave off? Are you okay? What? Your narcolepsy. Why? Did you really fall asleep all of a sudden? I wonder what would happen if I fall asleep now. Don't play around! But you thought I was playing around. Why isn't it starting? Why are you standing in the cold? Please wait inside my car. No, I'm okay. But I'm not okay. Please. You have to wait for thirty minutes. Why didn't you turn on the heater? I would've felt sorry for being warm here alone. It's not a question of being sorry, it's being naive. Do you know when this music was made? One hundred years ago. The beer tastes sweet. It does? You'll know why when you're all grown up. There is a day when it tastes sweet. Come on. Sounds like a dad saying "refreshing" to his son after a hot bath. Did something happen today? Huh? You're suddenly drinking. I just wanted to drink with my daughter. Is that weird? No. Just worried if anything had happened to you outside. You're mature now, worrying about me and all. It comes naturally. Mom. Can you buy me an MP3 player? Again? It broke. Why don't you go and sell your mom somewhere. How much is that bicycle? I don't remember. Why? Just asking. Do you know how to ride a bike? I rode a bike when I was a kid, but I've forgotten how to ride since it's been a while. Anyone can ride a bike well if they've ridden one before. - Is that so? - Yes. Do you want to ride mine? Wow! - Be careful. - Okay. Mom, aren't we going to have lunch? Are you going to clean all day? You finish it up. Turn off the TV and do it! Don't you listen to me? Okay, after I watch this. Won-woo! Let's go to a good place for coffee. Won-woo, I'm on my way now. Group project? With whom? Okay. Shall we go? How is it? It's nice. Why do you keep looking at me like that? How? You look at me as if you know me well. I do? We surely don't know each other, but you look at me as if you do. You're like a cat. A cat that will scratch me in no time if I step on you. How old are you? I can't see the sun since it's too cloudy. Have you ever entered the blog of a dead person? No. Have you? I randomly entered this blog once. The brother of the blog's owner had written that his sister died. I feel so sorry for that brother. He said that he was going to upload the photos in his sister's camera. They were probably last seen by his sister. I wonder how it would feel arranging the photos taken by a dead person. He said that he would use the camera because her soul remained in it. He felt as if his sister could see the world through the camera. Madam Seo, I'm home! Madam Seo! I think Mom's making potato pancakes. Perfect, I wanted to eat some. What is that? Pumpkins. Mom! What happened to your face? Do you want to try it, too? You weren't cooking potato pancakes? Potato pancakes? You want to eat some? Never mind. I'll ask Madam Seo. I'll be back. Eat some of this first. It's a dinner engagement. Tastes bad? Do you know what the best sound in the world is? What? The sound of my child swallowing food. Hey! It's hot. Be careful. The hot beans might burn your tongue. Is Won-woo sleeping? It's mom. Are you sleeping? I think my mom is dating someone. You don't like it? No. I don't know. Why? Because she's my mother. Mothers shouldn't do that. Why do you take pictures of their backsides? People can't see their back. When did you start taking pictures? It's been about five to six years. Did you take all these pictures? Those over there seem much older. Some of them are mine and some aren't. Who is this, in this picture? My older sister. She seems like the younger one. Who do you think the owner of this picture is? The person who took the picture or the one in the picture. Interesting. I've never thought about that before. Try it. Does it taste good? - Taste bad? - Yes. Really? You're far from ready to be getting married. You rascal. Which is worse? A lie or a secret? What are you talking about? You've been saying strange stuff lately. What? It depends. Did you do something wrong? What's the matter with you? Do you have something to hide? Did you lose your cell phone? No. Are you asking for a bike again? Will you buy me one? No way. When I say no, it means no. You got it? Why aren't you answering? Over-protection! Give it to me. Let me do it. No, I'll do it. Here. Did I ask you to do that? Hey! Kim Won-woo! Kim Won-woo! You know what time it is? You know how much I worried about you? What were you doing until now? Why are you late coming home lately? How dare you speak like that to me. It's because I grew up without a dad. Such a bad girl. Come eat! Give her a ride. Aren't you going to give her a ride? Does she have no feet or shoes? Dad. Aren't you going to do the group project? None of your business. You make me laugh. Not funny. Since you fall so many times, did something happen to your head? Maybe. Who did that? What's with you? What do you want from me? I'll kill you if you do that one more time. Sleepy head, then come take the ball away from me. Why? I'm hungry. Let's go get something to eat. Was it you? My dad taught me how to ride a bicycle. My dad was holding it from the back, but I screamed at him not to let go. Then my back suddenly felt bare. I turned around and my dad was far away. I was so scared that I couldn't press down on the pedal. Then I fell down right away. My dad picked me up and said to me, "If you stop, you'll fall down." What kind of person was he? He was just... He was very stubborn. He had a nice voice. His hands were very pretty. It doesn't seem true, but... I can't remember his face. Open the door! Hurry and open the door! Kim Won-woo! Open the door! Hello? Don't worry too much. Think it over and give me a call. Let's do that, okay? I'd also like for you to rest for a year. You can cure your illness and catch up on your studies. Sit up. Why didn't you sleep? Do you know what the most painful sound is? What? Hearing my child cry in pain. When I was pregnant with Won-woo, I took such good care of her. I'm not expecting anything from her. I just want her to graduate healthy and go to college like the other kids. But why is that so hard for my Won-woo? There isn't a single family with someone who is either deceased or sick. - Good-bye. - See you next week. Is something wrong? Please tell me. About what? Anything. I keep thinking about it. It spins around in my head over and over again. You must not be busy. I keep thinking about you. Turn it over. I didn't do my homework. Turn it over. I didn't do my homework. You're sick so it's okay. I said I didn't do my homework! I told you not to ride it! What the hell are you doing? Don't confuse making good dolls with raising your child well. Won-woo. Who asked you to raise me like this? When something breaks, it gets fixed. If not, then it's exchanged. If you had raised me like this, you should've fixed me. Even you can't cure me... What can I do if you prevent me from getting any worse? All you need to do is be careful. And not do anything that could be dangerous. Until when? Until when? Do I have to live being afraid of when I could fall next? How long do I have to be patient with what I can't do? What do you know? Won-woo. You did well until now. Who? Not me. I'm in so much pain. My heart is in so much pain. Although I got hurt a lot from falling, this pain is much worse than that! It's too painful thinking that I'm not worth anything. - Will she be alright? - She'll be okay. Thank you. When your grandfather passed away, I never saw your grandmother cry even once. At that time, I thought my mom was a very strong woman. Perhaps. I thought she might have not loved my dad. But, when your dad passed away she cried so much. When her husband passed away, she couldn't cry because she felt sorry for her little daughter. But when her son-in-law died, she cried a lot because she felt sorry for her daughter being left alone. Did you wait for me? Do you like my mom? Yes. I like her. Are you sick anywhere? Feel confident that you could live longer than a turtle? Where are you going? Ticket to Gangneung city. Sure that you can go alone? Yes. Then shall I go on a bicycle? Kim Won-woo! You deserved it. You're glad it, huh? Yeah, absolutely. Mom. Were you happy while raising me? No. That's why I could endure it. Thanks. Want to make a bet with your mom? What will you do if I win? What will you do if I win? It's nonsense. Madam Seo! Shall I major in photography? You do whatever you want except stealing. What is this? When you were young, your dad took your tooth out, and threw it towards the roof saying, "Give me a new tooth for an old one." It fell from the roof with the rain, and ended up in the kitchen garden. There could be more of them.
