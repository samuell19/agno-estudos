Blanca. Sister! Don't worry, I'll save you, Xian. JINSHAN TEMPLE, ZHENJIANG If you really insist on doing this, then you'll need your sister by your side. Let's destroy that temple. Vajrasamādhi, the power of stillness. All living things are within me. Leave! Take her! Sister! Aum mani padme hūm. Xu Xian! Xu Xian! Master! Master, please! You know she's not a threat. Master, you are far more powerful. Have mercy on her. Blanca! - Verta. - Hold on. All this was my choice. He's not to blame. That man isn't Xuan anymore. Why can't you see that? Verta, I believe you won't make things difficult. So please... deliver this child to his father. No! Verta. You must keep going! Sister. No! Blanca! Imprisoned under Hangzhou's Leifeng Pagoda, till the end of days. My... how sinful. Fahai, you're one to talk. Lust, murder... Your hands aren't clean either. What gives you the right to persecute us? Even men of faith fall prey to our base of nature. I'm human. I am not worthy. But Dharma is eternal, and far greater than I. I administer its justice as its servant. You liar! You hide behind Dharma. We were just living our lives. We were peaceful, harming no one. And you destroyed us. You're not more righteous. All you are is strong. You just abuse those weaker than you! I will not take it. You ought to leave. You are so useless. And you've always been useless. You just failed her... ...in every incarnation. You think becoming a monk frees you from your worldly attachments. I won't go. At least not until I kill you first! Tangled fortunes, lives of falsehoods. The pursuit of illusion... bars the way to Nirvana. Go seek enlightenment in a world devoid of one's self. Blanca... GREAT TREASURES SUTRA: EVIL OPENS FOUR PATHS. HELL, HUNGRY GHOST, BEAST, AND ASURAVILLE. ASURAVILLE, THE PATH TRAVELED BY THE OBSESSED AND THE QUARRELSOME. What is this place? Am I inside the Pagoda as well? Blanca! Blanca! Are you here? Fahai, you coward. Where did you send me to? Show yourself! My powers? Who's there? Answer me! Come on! I'm all out. What? Get in. Hey, thanks. So you must be new here? Name's Sun. Well, last name. - Come on. - Sun... M... Ms. Sun. Can you tell me where we are? This place? It's Asuraville. Asuraville? Hurry, we should get inside. Those damn Ox-Heads and Horse-Faces can't be far. The one who saved us, who was he? That guy? He thinks he's some kind of hero. But he's really not that strong. And he doesn't take any sides. Here, if you don't take sides, you die. Come on. This area's our home base. It's Octopus territory. - You saw how dangerous it is outside. - Please, I'm sorry. - It's way safer in here. - Keep going, huh? Stay. We're somewhat safer. Hey, what era are you from? - Um, what era? - Mm-hm. Uh, Song. Which dynasty are you from? Way after Song. By like a thousand years. It's not like you get it, okay? The folks here are from every era. Humans, demons, and those Ox-Heads and Horse-Faces. I actually haven't been here that long. I went rock climbing two months ago, then six feet from the summit, I suddenly slipped and fell. It went dark. Opened my eyes, and I was here. Demons and monsters actually exists. And there's also... Come here! So you see, demons and monsters aren't that tough. I mean, yeah, they're strong, but they can't shape-shift. And they have no magical powers like in the legends. I don't get it. What is Asuraville? Not heaven or hell, and not really the human realm either. But just like in the human realm, it's all about survival. And whether you're human or demon, only the strong survive. Oh, yeah, baby. That's how it works around here. Just like I keep telling you. Just be my girl and you'll be fine. Why risk it when you could be with a big, strong man like me? - Ooh, you've got a friend for me. - Get lost. Whoa! Why are you all so emotional? Maybe you really should think of my invitation. - Back off. It's mine. - Let's go. No, it's mine. - Give it to me! Just a little piece. - Got it. - It belongs to me. I saw it first. - Finder's keepers. - In here. - Stop! Soda? Let me show you some books. They'll give a crash course on the thousand years since the Song dynasty. Time jumping like that must be weird, right? I did it before. By 500 years. Really? This one's not bad. Have a look. This has some good stuff in it too. Someone saved a whole lot of info on it. You'll see what you missed in the last millennium. Okay. Maybe you didn't miss much. Here, try it. Wide stance. Line up your sights. Again. Hm. Yeah. The city is literally alive. Alive? And that's not the weirdest thing. Not by a long shot. I don't really care what it's like here. I just want a way out. I have to save my sister. Well, to get out you gotta survive first. Damn. All the Ox-Heads and Horse-Faces are here. Let's go. They wanna take over the building. - Why? - I don't know. But they'll kill every last one of us to do it. Hurry. This way's blocked. The roof! Come on! Bring it! Mr. Ox. Well, Simon. So we meet again. You know, every second since I showed up, I've been in danger. Staying alive this long... ...not easy. Indeed. You really wanna spend your time fighting, you wanna rethink that. They're already up here? Asuraville only needs one leader. Go! Go! Go! As you know, gang fights, they never end well. Just so we're clear, I'll be the winner here. I guess it's time we find out. After all, there's no time like the present. Got that right. Stay close. Ms. Sun! Go! Let's go! Huh? Let's go! Hurry! Get in. Why does he keep taking in strays? Seriously, what the heck? Who's side is he even on? These spirits and demons are out of control! When I first arrived, they'd appear maybe once a month. But no. Now, it's happening every few days! Yeah, Third Lieutenant. Whether of storm, fire, flood, or even poisonous gas. Every kalpas cycle brings more spirits and demons. They're cycling faster and faster. We're doomed. They'll destroy us all. We need to present a united front. It's our only hope. That's why we need to band together, instead of opening our doors to just everyone. That's right! 'Cause this is Raksha territory. You worthless humans and demons should leave. - Why should we listen to you? - Say that again if you dare! You think I won't kill you? Well, I'm not a Raksha, and I'm not some monster either. Yeah. If Simon hadn't come along, we Raksha's would've been wiped out. Or did you forget why we made him our leader? You all swore a blood oath. I expected way more out of you, Third and Fourth Lieutenant. We welcome all these... we can use. What about her? How is she useful? You damn little demon! Listen Raksha, you don't wanna try me. I'm not scared of a little mud, or you either. Or those Horse-Faces and Ox-Heads. Arrogant demon scum! You were the ones who made me your leader. And ever since, I've done what I could to keep you safe... ...and make you proud. However... things will happen no matter what. Evil spirits of pure disaster strike. But our priority is getting supplies. That's right. Thank you. We should have enough food, but our fuel is in short supply. At sunrise, when the spirits retreat, I'll hit up All-Good Market. All-Good Market? Oh... and this one's coming too. All right, Boss. If she can bring us all back supplies, then let it be settled. The Raksha will embrace her as our own. As soon as you're ready, we'll hit the road. I'll wait outside. It's pretty freaky when the buildings fall down. But in the rubble, there's cars, food, tons of stuff. A couple of fish get washed up after a low tide. Is this a punishment? Who ends up here? People who can't accept reality. Instead of being reincarnated, you cling to this life. Well, then... it's true of me. She knew she could rely on me. Then my sister ruined our bond by falling for a pathetic human. If she had to fall in love, then she should've at least picked a man who was strong enough to protect her. You're stronger than most, small pool. What's up with the Ox-Heads and the Horse-Faces? Oh, them? They're monster clans. Here, we have humans and demons, and the Ox-Heads, Horse-Faces and Rakshas are monsters. And those evil spirits? They were humans, demons, or monsters. Or at least we think they once were a long time ago. If they get their teeth in you, then you turn into one. Your driving really needs work. Everyone agreed that the area from here on belongs to All-Good Market. Neutral grounds. No one's turf. This place. The owner of this land, she's the one to talk to. Hand it over. Here. What are you doing? Stop him! Watch where you're going! Hey! Wait! You know that guy? When I first got here, he saved me. We have new guests, I see. Simon tells me you want to know the origin of Asuraville? Yes, I do. What exactly is this place? And why did I end up here? You can have this back. Since you know two of my old customers, and I feel generous today, fine, I'll tell you. The most agonizing feeling in the world... ...is an unfulfilled desire. Asuraville was created by the potent resentment brimming from all of humanities' unmet luck. No reincarnation. No. Not for you, time travelers. Your incessant obsessions landed all of you where you are. Obsessions? It's not what you seek and can't renounce. It's what tortures you and fills you with resentment. You're obsessed. When that desire is unsatisfied, it latches onto something material. A token. Everyone arrives here with one. And that token is a manifestation of your one great obsession. True. This medicine gourd has been a pain in my ass. Then, how do I get out of this place? This way. Since all obsessions stand from a lingering attachment of some kind, to release the obsessions hold, you must first release your hold on the attachment. The water before you is called, Release. Dive in and you'll escape Asuraville. It's that easy? Of course, silly. Impressive, right? However... ...everything just fades away when in these waters. That includes those little obsessions. They all hesitate before jumping. Every last one of them. See for yourself. Why do they pause? Because before jumping, the water confronts them with the very thing that torments them so. I don't accept this. I can't. I just need more time. I know I can pass the exam. I'll pass it for sure. I know I can do this time. ♪ So much sorrow ♪ ♪ Who can I tell ♪ ♪ A misplaced love and there I fell ♪ ♪ How to put aside ♪ ♪ Such a beautiful infatuation ♪ ♪ In the rain and wind ♪ ♪ I dwell ♪ Very nice! The Peach Blossom Fairy has freed herself! And there you have it. A piece of her soul was attached to that jade. Now, it's over. Easy as that. Both her obsessions and soul are gone. The water washed away all that tied her to this realm. Once unburdened, she was free to leave Asuraville. Why can't I see my obsession? How could you expect to? When you can't recall what it was. Verta. Blanca. Whatever he looks like, whether he remembers me or not, I have to find him. After all, I remember. Why couldn't you let go of him? Just tell me why! Tell me why! Just tell me why! Ready to take the leap? If you do, you'll finally leave Asuraville. You'll forget the person in the water. Forget everything and finally be free. Don't worry. It's hard. I knew you wouldn't jump in. I mean, if you're here, it's clearly 'cause you can't let go, am I right? Take care. Same to you. A kalpa! It hasn't even been 24 hours yet! Let's go! It's heading our way! Come on! - Get inside! - These kalpas, what are they? Calamity cycles. It's Asuraville inhaling and exhaling. Between breaths, it makes sure its work of eliminating those poor conflicted souls who refuse to leave. It won't hold! To the Pool! - Come on! Quick, hurry! - Get in! My brush! Ah! No! They're impossible to kill, unless you cut off their heads. Hm? Everything was burned! Guess we're walking! Are you all right? I'm fine. Simon, why don't we take him with us? The guy you saved just turned around and put you in danger. We're stuck in Asuraville. Do you think you're a bodhisattva or something? Do you have any other powers? You're nothing but a bad imitation. Good hearted yet weak, who hurts himself and others. I knew someone like that. But he saved me, so there's that. Let's take him back to Raksha territory. I'm not taking someone who won't even show me their face. Walk around here with a face like that... ...rather appropriate. Okay. I'll take him. Where did they go? Something's wrong. Let's go around. Go! Get out of here! - Retreat! - Leave! I'll take you all on! Let's go. No! You die tonight. It's the end of the Rakshas. Where is Simon? You missed him. Sorry. Don't worry, though, he'll be back for your head. Victory! Victory! Victory! A great victory over the Rakshas is thanks to your efforts. Laws of heaven and earth dictate, all must die and be reborn. So, like the city of Asuraville, all forms are temporary. Existence is short. Kalpas must run their course. Arise. For you are now Defenders. The moment has arrived. Reveal to them your new chosen form! Victory! Victory! Victory! This isn't the end. I'll make them pay. Run! Flood kalpa! Quick, that door. He's just dead weight. Verta, let's leave. Then we can live to fight another day. And together, we'll find a way to leave Asuraville. Don't worry about me. You should just leave. Simon, help us. - Simon? - I was wrong. Simon! Just like him... ...a dead weight I refuse to shoulder. Simon! All men are all the same, it turns out. Strong or weak. Whenever things get difficult, they fail you. Why did I end up in Asuraville? I've often struggled at death's door. So why do I fight? Why hold on? If I know one thing, it's that this is the way the world is. I'm sorry... Blanca. Verta. Verta. If I were to get bitten by these creatures, and fade into nothingness, that would be a release too. Verta! Verta! Verta! Look at me! Verta. You must keep going! You're her! You're Blanca! Watch out! Blanca. Look at that, it's another twilight. How many have you and I seen together? You have no memories of being trapped under the pagoda? How'd you escape? If you're her, then why are you in the body of a man? I don't know. I can't recall. All I know is when I tried to cross the street... ...the light changed back. And there was a truck. I flew into the air. It was as if time had stopped. What happened to me? Why was I floating there? I sensed someone was waiting. Everything stood still. I actually know the feeling well. Then I hit the ground. When I woke up, I was faced down on the concrete. There was fire. Fire was everywhere. And here I was. This bone flute was there as well. But I still can't figure out why this thing represents my obsession. All I know is I have to leave here... and find that person. The one whose face... I couldn't make out in the water. Asuraville. It's no different from the outside world. Only the strong survive. Even here, that's true. My sister loved a man who had a big heart, but a weak body. That's when I decided that one day, if I ever fell in love, it would be with someone strong and capable. One who, in times of trouble, would be able to protect me. I thought I found that when I met Simon. But he was also useless. In the face of danger, he betrayed me and left me to die. So maybe my sister was right. In love, strength doesn't matter. And so then, the only thing that matters is them having a good heart. You don't remember me. So when I got here, why'd you save me? I'm not sure. I just knew I had to. No matter how dangerous it was. Really, that's the truth. And you... felt familiar. Though you forgot the past... ...you still felt our bond. I understand. Blanca. All that matters is that you're here, and that we're together again. Just us. The owner of All-Good Market. Does she know of other ways to get out of here? Of everyone here, she can come and go of her own freewill. I'm sure she would know of a way. Would she help us? I heard she came here... because humans and demons all possess things she wants. She's a business woman. It's true, I'm a business woman. So you say you want to leave Asuraville, but can you afford to pay what it will cost? What do you want? Just say the word. Come. In the human realm, I run a small business, you see. It's actually a workshop. And this little workshop of mine has smelters are hard at working, which means the forge requires a lot of fuel. So I power it by deriving fuel from your little obsessions. The stronger they are, the more intense the obsession, and the harder they burn. So what I from you and you... ...are your obsessions. Just before you both got here, another disillusioned soul at its wit's end, quite coincidentally, came to conduct some business. He also wanted to leave Asuraville. Verta! Simon! Oh, that's awkward. Let me guess, Simon and you are having a little feud? No way. Well, Simon, have you thought about our deal? What do you wanna do? Let's go! If you desire to leave this place, there is another option. Via the Wish Bridge. It's harder, but the advantage is that you get to leave Asuraville with body and memories still fully intact. Simon's choice though was obviously this one. His obsession is quite fierce. It will make an excellent source of fuel. If I take away your pesky, little obsession, be forewarned, you'll then lose every last ounce of your will and be weak like him. Are you still interested? Weak or strong, it doesn't matter. As long as we can get out of here, and the two of us can be together. I'll do anything. And what does our other guest say? Yeah, it's a deal. Good, let's start. Watch closely. The layout of Asuraville is almost the body of a live serpent. See how its head and tail almost connect at that section there? The intriguing thing is that the tail is where all the evil spirits nest and congregate. Even more intriguing is that from time to time, the snake's tail grows a little bridge right off the end. That is the Wish Bridge. If you take a running leap off of it directly into the snake's mouth, you can then escape from Asuraville. If you want to jump off the Wish Bridge, you better be careful. The timing of it is crucial. What do you mean? Do you think I'm an idiot? I am a businesswoman. Once the deal is done, only then will I tell you. But considering we've met before, even if the deal were to fall through, sure, why not. I'll let you in on a little secret. Now, listen close. Why does the Wish Bridge grow? Remember that... Ox-Heads and Horse-Faces! They just killed the Rakshas, and that wasn't enough? Now, they need to smash my market? The iron chains! Let's go. Hurry! Hm? Cut the chain! Open fire on the fleas! Here. Forward! Fire kalpa, they destroyed our defenses. Retreat to the Pool? Go. Well, well, Simon, your old friend is here. What? What could he possibly want? I'd imagine he wants all of Asuraville. That was fast. What a shame. Looks like we're trapped. What do you do now? All right, Boss, it's been a good time, but I'm not gonna make it to the Wish Bridge. But I still need to thank you. After getting rid of my token, I don't have a care in the world. No need. It's just business. Verta, I apologize. Goodbye for now. Well, Simon, our little cat-and-mouse game has come to an end. To an end? No way. We're only just getting started. Simon! Watch out! Blanca! Blanca? Today marks the day I've conquered all of Asuraville. Tell me Madam Proprietress, how about you and I form an alliance? So do all those who join you need to wear an incredibly tasteless skin mask? As a matter of fact, do you care to venture a guess as how I found you so quickly? I know you're an intelligent woman, and it's common knowledge that by putting on a mask of this nature, you can change your appearance into anything you could possibly imagine. That's obvious, but... there's another use that very few people are aware of. It gives off a smell that's rather distinct. So it doesn't matter wherever you go, I can track you down. Indeed, I could smell you. There was no use in hiding. You did very well. It was definitely worth saving your life and giving you the mask. What's that mean? It was only after I've removed his skin mask was I able to put two and two together that this guy was your spy. Gotta say, Boss, you're really smart. You're not my sister? Then who are you? You betrayed me! How could I have believed you were Blanca? Now, select your final form. Do it. Rise and step into your role as a Defender. And like Asuraville, old forms are temporary. Old forms are temporary! My existence is short. Old forms are temporary! Kalpas must run their course. He changed to the same human face? That's not right. Did it now work? I just realized something. You lost face in more than one way. It must be so humiliating for you. Oh, a little word of advice. When the next kalpa begins... ...throw yourself in. A parting gift. Enjoy the water! Show yourself! Verta! Boss! We're drowning! Verta! Over here! Verta! Who are you? Who are you really? When I first got to Asuraville, all I had was a ruined face and no memory. The Ox took me in and saved me. I'm only alive... because of him. And then, the day I saw you, I don't know why, but I... In the Pool of Release, I saw that face. You called her Blanca. So while I was in the tunnel, I figured if I could somehow resemble Blanca, you'd listen to what I had to say... But you aren't her! You're right, I'm not. And it turns out I'm not strong enough to do very much, let alone help you. Strength doesn't matter. The strong can lie, then again, so can the weak. But you know what? I get it. It was my error. Why do I always rely on others? Whether they are weak or strong, anyone can let you down. And the way to avoid it is for me to get even stronger. So don't apologize. It's my mistake. I should've known the only one I can rely on is myself. So I won't let go of my obsession, and I won't rely on anyone else again. If I get stronger, then I'll be able to kill Fahai, topple that pagoda, and release myself from Asuraville! Back at the Pool, why'd you choose to keep her face? Well... Let's go. The fox told me what I needed to know. The secret of Wish Bridge. The thing that makes the Wish Bridge grow is Asuraville's black wind tunnel. And in that tunnel, they test your karma. If you somehow manage to survive everything that it throws at you, she said a path well extend from the snake's tail... and that is the Wish Bridge. We're here. This is it. Hurry! Get in! That fox loves butting her nose into things. All right... for her sake, I'll take you. Welcome aboard. Demon girl, know why you're in Asuraville? Could be karma or fate. Hard to say. But there's a reason for all your fear and loathing. And whatever it is, it's in that tunnel. Trial by fire, and I mean, literally. If you don't have what it takes, you'll be disintegrated. Hm. Do you still wanna go? My fear and loathing... I need to understand it. Hm. Sure. Well, good luck, girl. Thank you. Here I go. Verta! Verta! Are you all right? What was in there? Fahai. How long was I in there? A few seconds. Then you flew out. It's a barren void, and I was in there for two hours. Two hours? I'm going in. So, Little Demon, you've returned. You lousy monk. I have wiped out so much evil, yet a few always manage to slip through. You should release yourself from this obsession, Little Demon. You wish I would. You and the Ox are connected? It is the natural order for beings to reincarnate, not stay trap in their own resentment. This city shouldn't exist. I gave him a golden aura to help him conquer Asuraville. My desire was for him to exterminate all those there, one by one. So they'd be driven out. And be reincarnated. So he worked for you? What did he get in exchange? When he's task is complete, Asuraville would disappear. In exchange, I will spare him damnation, keep his body intact, and he'll go back to his world. Little Demon. You should release yourself too. My sole purpose is to ease others into their next lives. I don't need any help and certainly not from you! Aum mani padme hūm. Verta. Aum mani padme hūm. Stay back. I'm okay. Years have passed, yet still you keep fighting. When will you give up and let go? When you're finally defeated, and your tower lies in ruins! Verta! Verta! Verta! Here, hand it over. How's that? It's fine. It has been 20 years, Little Demon. And you have proven to be quite the annoying thorn. I told you I won't quit. Not until both you and the pagoda are gone. Dharma embraces all, though even it comes to an end. Not all is granted for that which is sought. So I'm not immune. I no longer possess the strength, so be it. This is for the best. Come on! Verta. You and I can leave Asuraville now. "When the next kalpa begins, throw yourself in." Twenty years in there is only one day here. You're karma free. Asuraville won't hold you any longer. Do your thing, Demon Girl. Mm. My aura's vanished. You lied to me, you wretched Monk! You lied to me! Huh? The Wish Bridge. What did the fox say? "When the kalpa begins, throw yourself in." You never told me your name. I don't know it, remember? Hey, you can call me whatever you want. It's just a name. Right. It's just a name. After I leave, I'm going to find my sister. And you can search for... the one you saw in the water. Let's go! Hurry! Huh? Hurry! Gas kalpa! Help me! Someone help me! Run! Jump! Let's go! The bridge is collapsing. I still haven't turned. Must hang in. I got to get out of here! Just to climb on the... No! I won't end up stuck here! Hurry! Hold on. I can go back. Just need to jump. I can still be saved. And I can finally go home. Quick! Why'd you let him bite you? You didn't have to do that. No! No! Wait! No! Don't do this! Go! Verta. I'm afraid that I can't leave Asuraville. Tell me why! It's not fair! That day, it was cloudy... but the air was filled with petals just like right now. I can see it... ...the blurry face in the water. Blanca! Come back! HANGZHOU I left Asuraville... and returned to the human realm. But I also left someone behind. It's impossible to go back. No one even knows where Asuraville is. And then, there's my sister. The Pagoda fell... but where is she? Are these new? - I haven't seen these before. - Yeah, you noticed. - Hey, let's take a selfie. - Sure. I'm so sorry. You always keep me waiting forever. Come on. Baby, don't be mad. Sir, is that Leifeng Pagoda? Huh? Why yes. It didn't fall? So then it's still standing? No. It was rebuilt. That's not the original. You must not be from here. Everyone here knows the story. The old tower fell centuries ago. Wait, it did? That's right. So if the legendary White Lady was trapped underneath it, she would have long been freed. Perhaps she cleansed her karma and reincarnated as a human. Who could really say though? She could be anywhere. Hey, if you can, try to check out the exhibition. After the pagoda collapsed, they found all kinds of treasure underneath it. You can see them on display. The colored patterns you see on the wall mostly used traditional painting method. The result is the great example of the simple elegance valued by ancient scholars. Gather round. Here, we have on display one of Leifeng Pagoda's little mysteries... Whoa! Is that a hairpin? Correct! It is a hairpin. But there's something rather unique about this one. You see, this one is not only incredibly ancient, it's made of bone. Legend has it, this item belonged to the White Lady. But what was it doing under Leifeng Pagoda? Why was it broken? Where's the missing piece? We may never know what actually transpired or how it ended up there. Blanca! You have no memories of being trapped under the pagoda? How'd you escape? I don't know. When I first got to Asuraville, I had a ruined face and no memory. There was fire everywhere. If you don't remember me, - so why'd you save me? - I'm not sure either. But I just knew I had to do it. When I saw you, you felt so familiar. And this bone flute, I don't know why it represents my obsession. Blanca. That person in Asuraville... that had to be you, right? You escaped the pagoda, and we found each other there. If you really insist on doing this, you need your sister by your side. Let's destroy that temple! Hold on! Blanca! Why can't I see my obsession? Find that person... the one whose face I couldn't make out in the water. Tell me why! It's not fair! That day, it was cloudy... but the air was filled with petals just like right now. I can see it... the blurry face in the water. That day it was cloudy, but the air was filled with petals. Blanca. The one you were looking for in the water... it was me. Verta... What do you want? Just say the word. Though you forgot the past, you still felt our bond. I understand. I have to leave here. I sensed someone's waiting. You never told me your name. I don't know it, remember? Hey, you can call me whatever you want. It's just a name. After I leave, I'm going to find my sister. And you can search for the one you saw in the water. Verta?
