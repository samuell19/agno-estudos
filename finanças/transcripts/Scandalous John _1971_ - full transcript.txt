?s aqui? Si, si, aqui ?s. I don't like this place. Mira, you ask about a job, huh? I don't like this place. The patr here, he will welcome you. He don't care if you are a wetback or a caballero grande. Adi?s. If the job is so good and there will be no trouble... why don't you keep it yourself? Caught you red-handed, didn't I? Now I got you, Whittaker! Now! No, no, no. I gotcha! Gotcha! Now I got you, Whittaker. Caught you red-handed, didn't I? Hold still, I tell you! Time! Whittaker, you mangy vagrant hound dog, I got you this time. I'm going to put a California double buckle on you, a real necktie-- McCanless, stop this, you hear? Ah, you stay out of this, Amanda! Whittaker, get back here. McCanless! That's a mortgage monkey, and he's going to do a Texas cakewalk today. Get over there! You aimed yourself under a cottonwood, and I say you're going to dance on thin air. McCanless! He's not the man! Can't you see he's not Whittaker? My, you ain't Whittaker. You're some kind of Mexican. Who are you anyway? Ah, never mind. Come on to the house and have some bread and gravy. Could have swore you was Whittaker. Just like him-- skulking around here disguising himself as a Mexican. Oh, you poor thing. Are you all right? Come on. No one's going to hurt you. Come on. Come on. Come on. Look, I'm awfully sorry about this. I'm afraid my grandfather mistook you for someone else. A bad person-- Un malo hombre-- that he was trying to frighten away. What's your name? Habla ingl?s? Come in the house. Look, let's iron this out. I'm Amanda McCanless, and that's my grandfather John McCanless. I am Francisco. Francisco Torrez Mart?nez. Mucho gusto. Put her there, Paco. Glad to meet you. Glad to have you with us. No, no, se?orita. Thank you, but I got to go. Get in here! I got to-- I got to meet my cousin. Come on. His name's Paco. What? Oh, yeah. I'll tell you what I need around here, son. Got to have a good all-around hand, see? There's not going to be too much for you to do: just doctor the stairs when they get wormy and pail up the cows when the weather pours, bust the green horses for riding, you understand, and I want you to dig a string of post holes on the ridge back there. No, it's over here. Never mind. And cook potatoes for me. I like both kinds: Mexican and plain. Both kinds, got that? What he means is you'll do the cooking and a few odd jobs around the house. That's all. I hope you ain't adverse to letting a little air into an interloper every now and then. I think he's just the man for the job. Yes, you'll do fine. No, thank you, se?or, but, you know-- Room, board, $20 a week. Not a dime more. Come on. This is the kitchen. This is the hallway. Long distance to walk. And this... is going to be your room. Not bad. I'm glad you like it. It's a good job. You have plenty of free time, good food, and you don't have to work hard at all. But what about he said I put air into people? What does this mean? Hogwash. Hogwash? He likes to pretend he's a tough old gunslinger. Once in a while, he does get sort of excited, but all you have to do is just stay out of his way. Come on, help me take the bed. Sometimes he does get sort of moody, and he locks himself up in his room. You make sure he gets his meals, okay? But, se?orita, you do not live here? Well, that's the problem, you see. I teach at the college, and I can't get out here every day. Comprende? Si. You can always reach me at the state college, Department of Animal Husbandry. I'll write it down. The main thing is if McCanless gets sick or anything goes wrong, you come and get me right away. You hear? But no tel?fono here? Well, we did have one, but, um, McCanless hated it. Says the Apaches cut the wires. You have Apaches here? Well, not very many, and they won't hurt you. Look, give us a chance. I think you'll like it here. Bye-bye. I'm glad you like it. House. Food. And $20. That's 250 Mexican pesos every week. Not bad. ...stream, not the river, but the stream Old hand's still got a tickle in it. Good thing, too. Never know when you're going to get bushwhacked these days. Interlopers. When are we going to eat? In a minute. Quit acting like a old woman. Told you I thought that Mexican was a land grabber. Yeah, he sure did look like a land grabber. Anyway, what if he had been? I'd have strung him up higher than a mountain goat. Then they'd have put you away for sure. I ain't in your behold, girl. I ain't behold to nobody. Well, you can't hang a paper mortgage. Got to do what I got to do. Whittaker's got half the land in the state all corralled and hogtied. Let him have his way... he'll flood the whole place, build up a big dam, make it into some kind of a fish pond for dudes. He ain't going to do that. He ain't going to turn God's good grazing land into that kind of a mess. First thing you know, there wouldn't be nobody here. No orchids, no arbors, no alleys, no trees, no people, no animals, nobody, nothing. Forever, all gone. Come on, sit down, eat your supper. I don't want no supper. Sick at my stomach. I ain't going to let nobody whittle me down to where I'm going to spook at my own spit. I told you before, I ain't afraid of no man. No man, no beast, no denizen of the jungle. I sure ain't afraid of no purple-tongued lawyer, courtroom coyotes, crooked bankers and politicians. Progress, they says. Gonna build theirselves a city. Ah, put up a great big beehive all made out of cement and glass. Neon signs, parking meters. Real estate developers, they call theirselves. Night crawlers and buzzards is what they are. Eh, insurance agents. Oh, I, uh, see you found something to eat. Ice cubes. The... in my town has one of these things in his house. Want some? Uh, no, thank you. Look, I have to go. Uh, his dinner's here. Would you see that he eats it? And don't leave him by himself too much. I'll look in on him Friday. Adi?s. You eat now, Se?or McCanless? The senorita says you have to eat something. Uh, you know how to play one of them things? A little bit. Come on over here and see what you can do, son. Here you go. You know "Poor Howard"? Poor Howard's dead and gone... Play anything. Play one of them-- Yeah. All right. You really move the mail on that thing, boy. You know any more of them pieces kicks up in the middle like that, packs double? Plenty, se?or McCanless. Well, we're going to have us some high old times, entiendes? Senor Juan, okay. Okay, hombre, okay. Senor Juan, where do you wish me to put this thing? Well, you put that thing anywhere you want. That's all yours now, cowboy. Go on and play it. Play all you want to. Well, think about a Western monument, an historical landmark to mark your father's project. Now, wouldn't your father be proud of a thing like that? McCanless, you've been living in the sun too much. What do you mean by that? I mean my old man won't buy it. As Whittaker International Incorporated's brand-new special representative in the New Mexico region, Mr. Power Elite's little errand boy, I know what I say. He should be here. Is el senor aqui? He's gone to ride the fence. He's coming back soon. This is Paco. It's nice, isn't it? I mean, sort of warm and rustic? Don't you think so? Too soon to tell. What do they say about us? The townsfolk? No, your papers and reports. Your grandfather's the son of old Pistol Pete McCanless, who carved out a cattle empire in the last century. He's a born pigeon, long on generosity. Tends to give his land away. Grub stakes every tramp looking for a handout, any neighbor who's in trouble. So lately no more empire. Also, he flipped out when he lost his wife. Still thinks he's bossing a big spread, fighting Indians. Flipped out. What's that, city lingo? Smart talk for a man who loves the West and gets confused because he's lonely? He married her when she was 15. You might flip out, too, if you'd lost somebody you loved. What's supposed to happen to him if he loses this ranch, too? Give me one reason why your property deserves special treatment. I'm not looking for charity, Mr. Whittaker. You still haven't given me a reason why I should try and sell my dad on your idea. I mean, in classic Western land foreclosures, customary payment for the burning of the mortgage is some measure of the victim lady's gratitude. Know what I mean? You've got to be kidding. Maybe not. Don't you feel the chemistry at work? Well, I don't know if I should shoot you full of holes or just run you off the place. Doing that would be the same as running your grandfather off, wouldn't it? Think about that. Hell! What are you doing in my house? Whittaker's the handle. Jim Whittaker. This is my grandfather. Whittaker? Ah, yeah. You're the sprout, ain't you? Well, this is old Judge Sam Walker here. Oh, I don't think things are that bad. Not yet. The little lady here and I have been talking. She's been telling me about a scheme of hers just might save your neck. She thinks my dad should turn what's left of this little spread of yours into the McCanless Western Museum. What? What? That's right. You stinking louse. A kind of monument, with you in residence to tend the place. A monument? You mean you want to turn my ranch into some kind of public picnic ground with a brass pigeon roost? I'd sooner get a tin bill and peck with the chickens. Ah, you tell your daddy he sends any more of his purple-tongues lawyers tapping around here, they're going to meet up with the old judge. Carrion pickers. Night crawlers. Ain't no toady going to turn my ranch into a dude-run. Mr. McCanless, you have 40 days grace when your time here's up. 40 days? That's all the time I need to turn my hidden assets right into coin. 40 days, you say? What are you cooking up now? In 40 days, I can get my top hands toughened up hard as horns. What hidden assets, McCanless? Take more than any land grabber to plow me under. Our office knows what shape your credit's in, sir. Miss McCanless' salary is your only income. Hmm, you're real tricky, ain't you? I'm tricky myself. See that? Curly Bill, we call it. There. Curly Bill. The road agent's spin. Ha ha! I hope for your sake that thing isn't loaded. How is that? Want me to dance now, right? Excuse me. Whittaker! I ain't through with you yet! I'm reloading, you hear? Here I come, Whittaker! And get off my land, you wet-eared whelp! Well, sir. Got some sand in his craw, hasn't he? As well as shifty eyes. What assets were you referring to in there, McCanless? Desert air? Desert air, yeah. They'll be putting that in bottles and selling it, too, if I let them. They ain't going to do it. No, sir. They ain't going to do it. Who's that? Hey, there, you belly-crawling son of a horse thief! Qu? pasa, hombre? Qu?-- All right, you red devils. You asked for it. Now you're going to get it! All right, you belly crawlers! Here I am! Come and get me! Ha ha ha ha! There you are, son. Take them guns, and we'll lift us some hair. What happened? Seen one right there a minute ago. I think I winged the gut eater. But that was me, Don Juan. Here they come! Apaches! But-- But, se?or-- - There they go! - Where? There they go right there! Thieves of horses! Let's go after them. No, no, no, no. No, hold it, hold it. No use cut and sighing now. We dig in, and they got to make the first move. Get down there. Get down. Will you? That was good shooting, compadre. Here. You can keep that. It's a good gun for you. Now, then... Have a little of that. Old Horse Hide. One good way to die. Don't try talking there for a minute till you get used to it. Hell, by the Billy-O, we fanned their tails, didn't we? Senor Juan, we scare them. Yes, yes. Yes, you're all bone, grit, and p'ison, ain't you? Come on in the house, and we'll do some serious drinking. All right. I ride an Old Paint I got ya! It's fun, ain't it? Sure beats playing Pee Wee golf and burning them Indian heads into them leather cushions. Here you are, son. Here, get going on that while I dig us out a couple of more here. Let's settle down, have us a good talk. There you are. Getting used to it, ain't you? That's a fine drink for a man. There. Look there. See them horns? They came off of old Blue Lightning. That was our first seed bull. Granddaddy to half the cows in the West. Had to bullfight. Oh, yes. Pert near broke my daddy's heart when he died. There he is. Pistol Pete McCanless. Greatest trail boss ever took steers and all to the rail head. Yeah. After old Blue Lightning died, my dad went and had this made out of a horn off one of the cows. He used to stand out in the pasture and blow taps. Tears rolling down his face. Oh, he was a great man, he was. He was a real man. He didn't spend his life messing around with women and books, the way I did. Nope. He didn't real full span and then look back over the long trail of life and see nothing but a lot of half-baked dreams in his day. Well, did he or didn't he, I asked? No, no. I don't think so. Ah, I bet he didn't. He had them all dancing to his tune in them days. They was all scared of them. Know why? Because he was crazy. Now, just between you and me, it don't hurt none to let them think you're a midge out of your head. They they stay out of your way. Savvy? There's a drink in there. There you are, boy! Let's shut off and start again. I took a liking to you. Listen, I'm going to reveal to you my secret plan which I ain't told a soul. You blather at your peril. No, thank you, Don Juan. I don't want to hear. Listen to me! I'm talking to you. Now here's what we're going to do. We're gonna go on a cattle drive, you and me. I'm going to take my herd up north, and I'm going to sell them, and I'm going to pay off the mortgage on this place. Now, that'll put us both in almighty King Whittaker's will, won't it? We strike the trail like in the cowboy movies? Yeah, No, you hit the trail. Hit the trail, amigo. We're going to hit the trail to Warbag. Warbag? Warbag. That's Blackjack Ketchum's home town, ain't it? Who is Blackjack? Blackjack, who is he? He's bad news, that's who he is! I never knew his real name. It don't make no difference no how. Everybody's got a Blackjack in his life. Me, too? Yeah, you, too. Everybody's got a Blackjack. It don't make no difference who he is. I owed that lizard too long. I surely did. I owed you too long, Blackjack, you lizard! You hear that? Oh, that-- that don't make no difference. You and me are going on a trail drive, my boy, and I got to get you outfitted proper now. Here. You got a pistol. Now, that's a real good one. That's a real Mexican pistol. And there's a chihuahue?o. How do you like that? Quiero no m?s. That used to belong to one of Pancho Villa's Dorados. The revolution? Left it right here. Now, tomorrow I want to get you outfitted with a real spirited mount and a saddle for you. And we're going to sing our way north, my boy, right under the stars, and when we get there, we're going to find us a heaven of tall green grass and clear, cool water and solid gold. That's Quivira, the golden city. What? The golden city of Quivira. Oh, Quivira! Yeah, that's what you fellas call it. I like the sound of that. Quivira, the golden city. All right. Well, when we get to Quivira, we got to grass-fatten the herd first, and then we'll sell them. Top market price, of course. And you know what we're going to do? We're going to get us a couple of scarlet sweethearts, and we're going to honky tonk with them till the sun comes up. San Anton, Virginia City, all them places. We're gonna burn down the notch house and tie a knot in the devil's tail, ain't we? And what day of the week do you pay me, Don Juan? Why? Why do you want to know? What's that mean? A full belly, happy heart. Fully belly, happy heart. I like that. That's got a nice ring to it. Those are words of wisdom. Ah, you don't have to worry about that, Paco. Why, you're going to get paid a thousand-fold... of gold, glory, everything you want. Know why? When we left that last dust storm behind, forded that last river, and we topped that final rise, and we look down there, what do we see, hmm? Quivira. Quivira! Quivira. No. I ain't going to spend it all just to move around towns, you know. I'm going to come back here, and I'm going to get this old spread working again. Herd me out a full crew. Get some real honest-to-God cowboys. Top hands. None of these truck-driving rodeo dudes. Feed them good, pay them good. Don't pay them too good. You pay them enough so they can stomp and jingle on a Saturday night, and they respect you, you know. Because they're going to respect me anyhow. You know why? Because they'll know. They'll know, boy, that you and me took that herd and drove it out over that dust-devil desert and up through them mountains passes where the chinook howl and over them swollen rivers and down through the blood-drenched state plains. Blood-drenched state plains! Hear that? Uh, hear that, Fern? Where are you? Fern? There you are. There you are, sweetheart. Now it's chow time again. I don't want you to worry none because I ain't going to be gone too long. Yeah. She was very beautiful. Oh, yes, indeed. Yes. I ride an Old Paint Lead old Dan Goin' to Montana To show a houlihan Yeah, right there. Right there. Yeah. Yeah, I seen it happen over and over and over a thousand times. You can't trust none of them! Not a one. They ought to be stomped out, men like that. Poisoned. Let me know the poison wells. Yeah. I seen their tracks. Think they fooled me. What are you doing laying in bed there? Come on, son, get out of there. Big round-up today. Big round-up. Got to raise dust and move beef. What's wrong with you? A little touch of Mahoney Brothers, have you? Oh, curse on gringo whiskey. Now, now, now. Just get a little hot sun on you. That'll liven you right up. There you are. Put your hat on now. Get sweat to rolling. It'll leech out the pain. Come on. We got to go check the herd. Come on. Catch up, hombre. Ah, let's get a look at them here. Ah. No, you ain't a bit wormy here. Yes, sir. No, they're all fitter than a fiddler's elbow, every one of them. Come on now. But, Don Juan, this is the herd? Oh, yes, of course. - The herd. - Come on. Yeah. Yeah, sure as my mood that every one of them is sound as a dollar. Old Whiskey Pete there, that's my personal mount, but I'm going to let you have this little mule. He's as gentle as a lamb, and he's a sweetheart. He's a mite peaked this morning. He got to eating some jimson weed. The only critter I ever seen to like it. - Well-- - Fine animal. Yes, indeed. And safe. Low to the ground. There we go, cowboy. Fit you on to that. Now you're going to be the first man to sit in that saddle since Pancho Villa fought the Battle of Torreon. Put it right on him, Paco. What's wrong with you? Get that saddle on there and round up. I better ride with the bare back, okay? Yeah? If that's the way you want to do it, all right with me. There you are. It's a mite old, but it's a genuine hand plaited in Mexico Peter Maggay. I use a Plymouth whale line myself. Got a hard twist to... V?manos. There, head him off. What's the matter with you? Get mounted up there. Get out of that barn, you poly longhorn! Quit going in there now. All right. I'm gonna catch you. Head him off there! Round him up! What's the matter with you, Paco? Get out of there. Ah, I'm going to get this rope on you. Wait! Heart-breaking rut wolf, you. Whoa up, you! Ah, you slick side-- Just for that, I'm going to bulldog you! You hear? What happen, Don Juan? You all right? Don't move me. Don't move me. I think I broke something. It's all right. Go and take care of your mule. Who's that laughing? Well, sweet Mary Ann. Looks like somebody's deck's shy a joker. Where did you get them chaps, off a dead dude? Something wrong with them? Nothing wrong with them. Looks like they weigh about 40 pounds with all that tin on them. Run you bowlegged just standing up in them. How do you like my hat? That what it is? I was hoping you might hire me up - for a cowpoke. Afraid I can't do that. Couldn't afford it. Folks would start to talk. Say old John's got a fella out there working for him. Got a suit of clothes that weighs more than he does. See you're packing a pig iron, too. Yes. Curly Bill. Look there, the road agent's spin. Doesn't work. It's a fake. Mighty pretty, though. What can I do for you? Got business with you. Well, hunker right down there, and we'll make medicine. Hunker right down there. Ain't too limber, are you? Have a little of that. Drink her right down, cowboy. It'll loosen you right up. Go ahead, drink her right down. Atta boy. Now you can talk. There. I plan to see your granddaughter, but I don't like getting shot at. Nobody does. - So, uh-- - What's that? What are you figuring to do? You think you can buy me off with money? Maybe. Uh, does she know about this? No, not yet. Oh, boy, you are a glutton for punishment. I got to tell you something. You picked out the meanest little filly this side of heaven string sweetie-pies. We had a rodeo fella come through here about a year ago. He was tooken with her like you, and he like to bust his back bull riding, just trying to get her attention. She wouldn't even smile at him. There was another one up there in town. He got to moon calfing her so bad, he swore he was going to hang himself. Tried to do it, too. Hung hisself. Of course we cut him down before he choked to death. Didn't do him no good, not a bit. Son, I'd say that you have put your stake on the wrong number. Sounds pretty special. McCanless women always was. Are you going to take this? I don't say it don't come at a good time. What do you want me to do for that? Just sort of ease back and give you a little room, see if you can rope her? Yeah, something like that. Something like that, huh? Yeah. What if I took that money and used it to fight your old man? Tell you what. Old Dad will be out in these parts - in a few days. - He will? Where? In the flesh. Santa Rosa, Four Rivers, Horse Thief Junction, and Warbag. Warbag? What for? He's got his own precious antique railway car full of tame politicians. They're coming out to look over their land deal before they move in for the kill. Yeah, I bet they are. I'll just take that, son. I'll just take that, and I'll use it to move me some beef. And barring an Apache raid and a stampede, I'll get my herd to Grillhead, and I'll sell him. I'll get me some real money, and I'm going to pay off that mortgage. It's just a loan, you know. I'm going to pay you back once I pay the mortgage to your old man. And it's going to tie a knot in his tail he ain't going to get undone in a hurry. All right with you? It's all right with me. I got my own plans. Have you? All right, son. We'll just have us a drink to the long trail. I'm going in town tomorrow, and I'm going to buy me a mess of supplies, and I'm going to drive that herd of mine right out across that dust-devil desert. clean up there in that blood-dripping Injun country and down through them mountain passes where the chinook howls like a banshee and the bones of the mountain men are stacked up like cord wood. Go on there. Drink her right down, cowboy. Go on, drink her right down. Now wait a minute. Here, here. Hey, John! Scandalous John! The only kind of human beings worth trusting, - every one of them. - Si. Scandalous John! Scandalous John! Long, long ago Here, that's what they want. Hey, little fellas, come here. Catch up here now. Everybody ready? There you go. Bye, Scandalous John! Hi, there, Scandalous. Ah, a pile of-- Dollars to doughnuts, they stole them ponies. Ah, right on in there. Whoa. Oh, it's you, Mr. McCanless. Well, it's nice to see you, Mr. McCanless. And how have you been, Mr. McCanless? I want a pair of boots for my friend here. Uh, this gentleman? Buenos d?as, se?or. Put that hat back on your head! You don't take your hat off to no man. I said boots. A plain pair of black leather boots. Go on, look around that dude stuff. Must have some honest boots in there. Well, I'm not so sure that I-- Quit that, Whiskey Pete. He don't like that perfume you got all over you. It's not perfume. It's Lilac Tweed, a man's cologne. Eh, it smells like geranium water to me. One of them sissies. The woods is getting full of them. Jump down there and get your boots, son. Come on, boy. All right, stick your feet in them. Ai, chihuahua. How's that? Pinch you any? Ahh, what's pain next to such beauty? Yeah, you're some apples now, lad. All you need is a red silk shirt with some of them silver doo-bobs on it, and you'll be better than any of them. Well, come on, amigo. Let's get out of here. Ah, there's a rare old echo in here. Yeah. To the river! Now, Paco, I want you to go down to the general store, just before you get to the corner. Give the man that list. Tell him you want everything on it. There you are. I'll meet you in an hour. A little business down the street here. Hey, what are you doing? I want these things for se?or McCanless pronto. McCanless? Oh, yeah. Yeah, this way, please. Louis, take care of this gentleman. I'll be right back. Did he say John McCanless? Si. You know, this Mendoza who work for McCanless before you. She says paper are no good. The law will catch him. You know where he live? The sun is hot today. I knew this Mendoza. She say Se?or McCanless is crazy. Perhaps you like being locked up in Fort McCanless with a madman. or perhaps you have some reason to seek such privacy. Peon, you talk too much. I need my stuff. Si, senor. Have no fear, my son, of Paco: the kind of heart, the doer of great deed, the friend of Don Juan McCanless. Let's have your name, chico. I'm sheriff of Delgado County, son. Hector Pippin is my name. Now won't you tell me what your name is? Francisco Torrez Martinez. Where are you from, chico? Abilene. Place of residence. What street? Main Street. They always say Main Street. I would like to see any papers you have with you. I want to speak with Mr. McCanless. Now, now. We don't mistreat wetbacks here. I'll process you, give you a few tests to locate you on the sociometric scale, fingerprint you, and set you gently across the line. No, no, no, no, no, no. You got business here, Pippin? Good afternoon, John. Hey, you old nickel-plated law, what do you think you're doing holding up my top hand and my supplies? Yo, get them things out there to pick up and deliver to my ranch. Come on, jump! Now, now, I know most folks around here are in your debt, myself included, but you're headed for the lockup or worse. Go catch a steer. As for your man here, I'm afraid you're going to have to find another. This one's got to go back where he came from. That boy ain't going nowhere unless I tell him to. That's the best man in my outfit. Rode fence with that boy. Fought Comanches with him. He's a wetback, John. Mount right up. Mount-- Get right on your animal there, son. You're out of touch with reality, John. You want reality? Just start slapping leather. You know perfectly well I don't carry a gun. I go unarmed in emulation of the London bobbies. Best watch out you don't get a hole in your emulation. John, I'm going to have to ask you to turn over your man here and give me all your firearms. You make one fancy move, and you're going to get dusted, fore and aft. You're making a mistake again, John. Don't come around saying I never warned you. Paco, v?manos. Well... we got John Law on us now. Looks like we're going to hit the trail tonight. I heard that. Why don't you come along with us, son? They got room out there for a man to breathe. Thanks, but no, thanks. I'll put my time in here. Maybe they just went out for a ride. Oh, sure. With a broken-down old longhorn? Old John's no fool. He won't be easy to track. Well, that's all the more reason not to stand around here talking about it. He may have his crazy spells, but on a trail-- I must ask you not to use the term "crazy" until I've had an opportunity to speak with him. Certainly, doctor. I want to give John McCanless the benefit of any doubt. A great name in these parts. And I do want to apologize for dragging you all the way down here from the county seat. That's what I get paid for. Now, Mr. Whittaker, you were here. Which way did he go? South toward the border. All right, let's see here. Doctor, you know these parts about as well as any-- Well, not too well. Well, here's my thought on this. You know why they never caught up with Mangus Coloradus, the great Apache warrior? Greatest escape artist of his time. First move, he always said, get your enemy afoot. Viva Mangus Coloradus. What are you doing with that red light and "sireen"? It were coming loose, and I didn't want it to fall off and hurt someone. Sure. Well, we'll just bury them toys in the desert where they belong. Look at that. They even got a machine for howling. You know coyote's the only one got a right to howl out here. Don Juan. Do you think the police will catch us? You think that wind-up sheriff can track a man that growed up with a Comanche? Ha ha ha! Cover our tracks. Hee hee hee hee hee hee! I'm sorry, Miss Amanda. I won't protect him any longer. It's up to Doc Kropak here and the state authorities. But he hasn't hurt anyone. Miss Amanda, you know I'm on John's side, but look at that. Taking my siren. Do you know how long it took to get a first-class piece of equipment like that out of Kansas City? Look, I promise you he won't cause you any more trouble. I can take care of him. Yeah, you promised that before. Good night. Don't you worry. We'll find him. All right, where'd they go? North, straight across the desert. North by northeast, actually. How could you let them just take off like that? A helpless, proud old man who thinks he's-- Come on, they're probably on a cookout. They won't go far. The days are gone when you can disappear in the trackless desert. Oh, that's what you know about the desert. Do they have water or food or anything? They packed, took the works. I grub staked them so we could have a little time for ourselves. You low-down, belly-rich snake! Hey, wait a minute. They'll come back. Look, at least wait until tomorrow. What, and let the sheriff's men find him first? Why don't you butt out of this? By now McCanless sees himself a hunted man upon a "Wanted" poster. One sight of a uniform, and the shooting will start, and it's the Alamo all over again. And it's your fault! Hey. Maybe I goofed. It's possible. Can I go, too? Cougar! A cougar out there! Get out of here! Head back to town, I tell you! He just frightened the herd. Get out of here, you! There's a cougar out there! I see him. Looks like he's all right there. He's settled down, and he's going to eat then corn things. Never mind. There's a cougar out there somewhere lurking around. Vicious "preditators," I tell you. They-- They can desecrate a herd. Well, and he's all right now. He's settled down there. Uh, finish up that song. My horn. We were just getting to the sad part there. Oh, yes. That was the cougar, Don Juan? Looked like a cougar to me. I swear it was a cougar. Go on. Report. What? What do you mean, what? I want a report. Ah, I got to learn you everything. All right, you're riding in position here. It's called a drag. I'm riding up in the front there. That's called the point. Every now and then, I'm going to ride back here and find out how everything is at the drag. All you got to do is tell me. Well? It's okay at drag. That's more like it. I wonder if you can help us. We're looking for Mr. McCanless, John McCanless. Has he been by here? John McCanless? No, he hasn't, but Lordy knows he'd be welcome any time. He's a regular saint on earth. Hold on. I'll ask my husband. Alvin! You seen John McCanless? No, he says he ain't seen him, but you tell Mr. McCanless he's to come by any time he wants to. Lord, if it hadn't been for that kind, generous man, we'd have lost this place long ago. Well, good luck to you, Mr.-- Whittaker. James Whittaker. Whittak-- Whit-- Whit-- Alvin! There's a Whittaker on the premises! You miserable wretch! You scabby-- You get out of here, you hear me? Go on! Get out! Get out! Out! Out! Sic 'em! Right in the middle of-- Welcome to the real West, pardner. Good morning, Mr. Whittaker. Hiya, Senator. Glad you could make it. I came the moment I got your message. I appreciate it. Come on. The others are waiting. Any problems? Nothing that isn't being handled. That's what I like to hear. Some poor homesteader had that band in his wagon. This is one of the stopping spots on the great trail, Paco. Regular monument to the daring and the brave. This is one of them places where tragedy struck over and over and over, just like at the Donner Pass. They had to lighten their load, you see? Had to leave their things behind. And sometimes they fell by the wayside theirselves, with Comanche arrows sticking out of them, buried where they fell. Covered over by the winds. Mingled their bones with the bones of their oxen. Well, what's that? Huh, what's this? Stay there. Why, it's a dainty little dancing slipper. Look there. Bright as a pair of laughing lips. Where is she now, you suppose, Paco? Who was she anyhow? Buried out there under the sand, more than likely, wrapped around in the charred tarpaulin from her daddy's Calistoga wagon. No. No, I think I can see her setting on a buckboard, bouncing over Raton Pass, gritting her pretty little teeth against the tug of them leather guidelines and cussing. Yes, sir. Ladylike, of course. But cussing the bad luck that made her leave her party things back here. Qui?n sabe? I didn't ask you nothing. What are you doing with that stuff? Put it down there. Shame on you. Ain't you got no respect for nothing? Why, shame on you. Oh, maybe she's got herself a new pair of red boots now, and she's strutting for 10 bucks at some tent honky tonk up in Carson City. Ah, no, maybe she's way up Sacramento way... sitting there all alone in some little cabin, waiting for her mining man to come home and take her out to the stomp and holler. here's to you, dearie, wherever you are. You and all them other brave little girls that come by here. All honor to you. Bless your little hearts. well... they're all gone now, them kind. Now a bunch of flappers running around... these days. Why, them bloodthirsty thieves. Look at that. That's a lady down there, standing her ground against a whole circle of drink-mad savages. Oh, ain't that a sight to make your blood run cold. Keeping that poor woman captive and force her to serve them the liquor. Forcing her. Well, she ain't so friendless as she thinks. Se?or McCanless, let's get out of here. No, Paco. I never invited you to this game. Never was a day when John McCanless wasn't a match for five drunk renegades. Whatever happens, don't let them take you alive. Charge! Don Juan! Stop! Who's the old nut? Search me. I'll tell you. Some of the dingalings that come through here sometimes. Are you okay? Yes, I'm all right. Gust of wind come along, tore my loop out of my hand, just when I was gonna fling it at them. All right, now you can tail me up here. Again? We're gonna get them this time. Don Juan, you will kill yourself. Shut up and push me up on my horse. Now come on. Atta boy. All right. Now, then, Whiskey. You crazy old coot! Don't you move. Time! Hey, Slugs, that old man is freaked out. Let's get out of here. Come on. What are you doing? Keep your iron on them. I'm going to see to the lady. John McCanless, ma'am, at your service. - You-- - Whoa, now. What do you mean service, you cr-creep! You ruined my place! Oh, my dear, don't take on like that now. I'm your friend. I'm here to help you. You just set right down there, and don't-- whoa. What do you mean, you old goat? Oh, what a terrible ordeal they put you through, haven't they? Don't you worry. I'm going to deal with these rowdies for you. Why, I-- Why, that-- that's Cochise hisself sitting right over there. He'll know what to do with them. Pardon me, ma'am. I'll only be a moment. I don't get it. You mean you don't know your own language, my brothers? Well, now listen, Chief, them braves there drinkum plenty fire water. Savvy? Get drunk. Do bad thing. Bad Indian. Now you takem back reservation, sober them up, be good Indian. Savvy? They not Indians. For Little Big Horn, okay. For massacre of wagon train, okay. But we no take rap for white weirdo. Well, I'll tell you what we do, Chief. There. Now listen, get them out of here. I don't want them bothering that plucky little lady again. Savvy? What are you going to do, scalp us? You can't do this to us. What's going on? You hear of civil rights, Sag? You're interfering with our civil rights! Run along. On out of here. It ain't your fault, my brothers. It's all ours. All ours. Never a cop around when you need one. You crazy old coot! Look what you done to my place! Now don't worry your pretty little head about your place. Here you are. I'm sure that'll pay to restore it to its former grandeur. But, Don Juan, that's our money. Mount right up there, pard. We got other things to do. I've got to bid you farewell now, little lady. However, I always want you to think of me as your personal protector. If you need me, all you got to do is holler. Just holler, and I'll come running. By your leave now. There you go. There you go, right around there. No one. Nothing but the desert. Man, I never knew it was that big before. I didn't think he'd go. Beat-up longhorn and a wetback for a saddle pal. He dreamed himself into a cattle drive. And he went and did it. When I was a little girl, his imagination was the best toy I had. He used to tell me all kinds of stories. And a lot of them were true, too. There was this little town... all deserted and falling down. He used to take me up there in a wagon. It was a real ghost town. We could climb out over those busted old wooden sidewalks, right up into the Red Dog Saloon. Then we'd kind of saunter on over to the bar, pretend like we were ordering drinks. And McCanless would twang like a banjo to the tune of "After the Ball." Sometimes I was the schoolmarm. And other times, I was the dance hall queen with a heart of gold. Then McCanless... would get those guns out and strap them on and pretend like he was having a walk-down on that... empty old street full of ghosts and lost dreams. Ah, you don't have to tell me McCanless was a great man, Whittaker. He is, in the eyes of a child. But we all have to grow up, don't we? For all the hurrah, he's just a lonesome, weary old man. That's all. He believes in what he's doing. And he has the guts to follow it to hell and gone. That's more than with a lot of us. All right, crank it up. Let's try it again. Paco? Hey, Paco. Come on, boy. Any life in you? Get out of there. There you go. How are you? Look there. That was a real, sure enough Oklahoma sandy. Rubbed everything real smooth. Here you are. Get your eye open. First I think I would not live. Second... I remember you do not pay me yet. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, I tell you. I ain't carrying anything smaller than a 50. That stuff clutters up your pockets, jangles around. Yeah, but-- Oh, listen, Paco, tell you what I'm going to do with you. I've been thinking about this. How'd you like to be a full partner? Share and share alike in the whole enterprise. I don't cotton to the idea of a man of your kind of caliber being a plain ordinary common employee, see? So what I'm going to do, I'm going to make you a full partner. We'll sell that herd, and we'll split the tally right down the middle, and we'll go on a real stem-winder. Just you and me. How'd you like that? Want to call yourself a rich man, huh? - Okay. - Okay. I like this fine. I like that, too. Shake on that, pard. Let's gather them up. Oh, thanks. Got to watch that there. Well, then, Whiskey. Get going. Move 'em out! Look, Don Juan! Don Juan, a city! A city, Don Juan! A city, a meal, and water! Look, Don Juan, a-- and-- and beer. Cold beer! Ain't nothing there, pard. That's a mirage. What? A mirage-- espejismo. Ain't nothing there. Just a trick of the imagination. But, compadre, look. Uh, it's one of the desert's most subtle tortures. Half optical illusion and half the deluded slaverings of the thirst-mad. You'd best get a hold of yourself, boy. They're going to be barring you for a hollow horn. Look, Don Juan, helado. Ice cream! Ice cream. Paco, I can't let you do it, pard. Sooner shoot you dead myself than set here and let you topple over the brink of madness. Now come on, son. Ain't nothing there. Espejismo. Si, Don Juan. Another mirage. Turn them critters! They're gonna fry themselves! Get out of there, you white-faced-- ah, you-- Get out of there! Let's go to the water! Yes, patr?n, that's our water! Ah, drink up, boys! Beef tea! Drinks is on the house! This is no mirage this time, huh? Each man Must find A pasture green Somewhere beyond The western wind Out where a man can hear Freedom singin' in his ear Where love, like lightning Touches him Some men were born To live each day Fenced in by pavements cold and gray But some men can never wait Locked outside freedom's gate They need to find A pasture green Some cool, gentle Pasture green All right, fellas, break it up. We got some live ones coming. Come on. And take off those Hush Puppies. Put on sandals. Now come on. Snap into it. There it is. Warbag, pard. Had some high old times here. Come the first time with my dad. The end of the trail, eh? Yes, indeed. I have an appointment here, you know, a long time coming, way overdue. Well, howdy, yourself. You nasty old Gomorrah, you. Oh, this is terrific. A real Indian. Ah, excuse me. Sorry. Keep your hand on your wallet. It's a raunchy-looking outfit they've got here. Well, now I need your poison, gents. Old Horse Hide, two of them, double. Old Horse Hide. Say, that's a pretty good name. I'm sorry I don't have it. I could let you have, oh, a Tom Mix or a Jack Hawksley or a Hoot Gibson. Or, if you prefer, a Boot Hill Belt, a Sagebrush Swizzle, or a Joshua Tree Julep. Heh heh heh. You're full of fun, ain't you? I said I want some whiskey, mister, straight whiskey now. Now you're getting it. Now, then, can you tell me when Blackjack's train comes into town? - Blackjack's train? - Yep. Well, the next train gets in at 5:10, if that's what you're talking about, but who's-- who's-- who's Blackjack? Don't go pretending you don't know who Blackjack is. Blackjack's got the whole town in his pocket, including you. Is that so? I'm going to bury the buzzard. Hello, there, cowboy. Well, hello, yourself, there, little-- Come here. What-- What's the matter with her? Uh, take it easy, fella. What do you mean, take it easy? I'd just like to remind you the girls here aren't paid. They're volunteers. What? Volunteers? They do what they do out of, well, social responsibility and civic pride. Worst-sounding thing I ever heard. Well, amigo, let's try bagging the tiger. Which way's the faro game? Pardon me. Help yourself. Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen. Place your bets. Lay 'em down and take a chance to lose and win as the case may be. Place your bets. Pardon me, ma'am. Howdy, cowboy. Howdy. I greet you with lion heart. Oh, do you? There. Well, well. Ha ha ha! It takes one to know one. I seen this article before up around Cheyenne, maybe Mile City. He's a shark. Watch him. He's fixing to copper me. Hey! Get your hands off of that pile. I know a rigged deck when I see it, slick. You been dealing brace, ain't you? Are you calling me a cheat, sir? Ha ha! Sounds familiar, don't it? You wouldn't shoot an unarmed man. Got a Hyatt, ain't you? Go for it if you got the sand. A Hyatt? Oh, you mean a sleeve gun. Yeah, well, uh...bang. Bang? Bang, is it? I'll give you bang. There's bang? How do you like that for bang? And bang? Hey, that's good. It's excellent. I've never seen the card game scene played that well before. Glad you liked it. Both of them have been smoking loco weed. Harry, go over the the prop shop and get a sleeve gun. It's those little details that make for a better characterization. There's the train, Paco. The big man is rolling into town. Where's that-- Get back here with that money, you! Give me that! Look out, lady! I'm trying to... Get back here! You card sharp! Stop, thief, stop. Paco, reload. What is this? What fool did that to my train? Blackjack hisself. Shh. Don't say nothing. I'm saving him for sundown. Over here, old timer. Let's go. Oh, don't worry about him, Sheriff. I took care of that card shark. He won't be back to bother you no more. Sheriff, take that old man in and lock him up. He's a menace to the public safety. Are you addressing me, sir? I'm sorry about your train there, but I happen to be serving the interests of justice, making a citizen's arrest, so to speak. Citizen's arrest? Let's go. You're another one of them flunkies for Blackjack, ain't you? Get your hand off my arm, boy, or one of us is gonna lose our dignity, and it ain't going to be me, either. McCanless! You leave him alone. Put that gun away. Now put it away. Where'd you come from anyhow? You look terrible, McCanless. McCanless? My name ain't McCanless. It's Slade. Slade, I tell you. Come on. Come on. Come on. No, amigo. Get out of here. You haven't done anything. All right. It's all over. I done something. Well, look who's here. Looks like the two of you might stop what was going to be in the report. I wish I hadn't. Might have been fun. Jimmy. Hi, Dad. I want you. Get in here. Listen, I'm just going over to the jail. I'll be right back. Now. Bit of excitement, eh, gentlemen? Well, remember you're in the Wild West now. I don't think it'll get much wilder. All right, as you know, due to the nature of our business, we've always been a closed circle. I'm going to presume on your good will and invite my son to take part in the proceedings. Are there any objections? If you say so, B.J. His generation doesn't think the way ours does. I know. I got a son of my own. That's your son, Murray. I happen to know mine. What I'm saying is that Jim, here, will be taking over some of my interests one of these days. He's been of great service in putting this project together. I'd just like to see him get his feet a little wetter. It's all right. Any observations so far, Jim? A couple. 200,000 acres of ranch land flooded out, two towns wiped out. Let's see. I... Six rivers gone forever. Personally, Jim, I want to commend you on the fine job you did in lining up those ranch properties down south. The price was right. I understand there's still one tough nut we have to crack, but we'll steam roller him. He's the man who shot up your train. That old saddle bum? It wasn't accidental. Is that what you're trying to say? No, sir, I don't know. I don't know what he might do. That's a fact. Gentlemen, the meeting is adjourned until 10:00 tonight. Thank you. Jim, stay here, will you? Why are you against me? What's your angle? I'm not sure. You win all the time. Maybe I'd like to see you lose just once. Me? You expect me to lose to him? I think you will. For three days on the trail, he did not eat. He was drinking Old Horse Hide, but he did not eat. I know, Paco. Stubborn old jughead. There's nothing anybody can do. Leave them boots alone. Oh, it's you. Well, as long as you're in town, Amanda, why don't you go over to the dry goods store with me and help me pick out some bolts of cloth for your grandma? And, uh, find that little gold chain she wanted, as slick as-- as silk. Go nice with that brooch of hers. Grandma would like that, McCanless. I'm sorry to intrude, Miss McCanless, but I really must get a couple of matters settled. I'm Barton Whittaker. I'm prepared to help you find a small home for your grandfather, some place where he can spend his last years confidently. I understand he needs medical help. Now, Miss McCanless, your property is vital to the Four Rivers Dam, a project that will bring prosperity to the people in this area, more industry, more jobs, et cetera. We don't want to have to have him declared incompetent. No deal, Blackjack. No deal. My name is Whittaker. Don't give a hoot what kind of alias you're using. You're Blackjack Casem. They told me the Daltons bushwhacked you outside Coffeeville. That was a dirty lie. McCanless, listen to him, please. Oh, Amanda, I told you you got nothing to worry about. I brung the herd up here. We're gonna sell them all. I've got bad news for you, Mr. McCanless, about your herd. Don't you tell me the price of beef's gone down because I won't believe a word of it. I have in my possession a report from the Health Department, dated today, late this afternoon. They made an inspection, and they found that your herd is tainted. Now, you're a responsible cattleman, Mr. McCanless. You can understand that. You've got me covered, haven't you, Blackjack? I'm not here to play games, McCanless! Stop it, both of you. I don't want you tearing around the country and tearing down your health and getting into trouble all the time. I love you, and I can't take what's happening to you, not anymore. The ranch is for you. It doesn't mean the same thing to me as it does to you. Well, I didn't know that. Well, let's look on the bright side. Getting rid of such a burden may help save your-- -- well, your reason. You think I'm crazy, do you, Blackjack? Well, I got you fooled there. That's a trick I learned from my daddy. He used to always tell me, "Keep them guessing," he said. "Keep them guessing." That's what I done, Blackjack. See? Hey, Walter Sheriff. Come here. Run all these people out of here now. I'm tired of all this talk. What kind of jail you running? I'll have my lawyer bring the papers by. What are you doing out here? It got so crowded there, I came out for air. You get back in there. Go on. Sheriff, keep them in there until I get those papers signed. I don't want him straying. Here's the key. They'll be here. Fine. Don Juan. Pss pss pss pss pss. I got them both. We go now? No, no. We'll go later on when it's quiet. Okay. Somebody's got to stop him. He'll grab up the whole world and pave it with cement. Why does it have to be McCanless? Because he's the only one with the courage to stand up to them. All your life you read and hear about men like him. When you don't come across them, it's very-- it's very easy to become cynical. I have, I guess. But there's hope, you see? Because there are men who are not phonies: John McCanless, for example. Oh, stop it. You're so hungry for something to believe in that you'd let him fight all by himself-- your father, the banks, the politicians, the government, the whole world. Well, he just can't do it. So it comes down to you and me. You and me, Amanda. But how? How? I don't know yet. Come on. What are you doing with our herd? Thieves! Stop! What do you mean, shh? That's our herd out there. It's going down the street with a bunch of rustlers dressed like mariachis. You say we are partners. Half of that herd is mine. They're not going to steal my half. Oigan! Savages! Comanches! Nice shooting, pard. All right, throw them guns over here. Get that door open. Whittaker has the key. McCanless. Oh, what's that? McCanless. What do you want? Shh! I got horses out here. Here. Help me put this through the bars. Think you know what you're doing? You're trying to tell the granddaughter of Scandalous John how to bust somebody out of a one-horse county jail? I wouldn't do that if I were you, Miss McCanless. Shut up, tin star. Whap-horse. There's your jail, Sheriff. Come on. They're getting away. There. - Jimmy. - I know. I turn off here to throw the posse off the track. Now you got the idea, pilgrim. Come on, Paco. Get on. Gotcha, pard. Good evening, gents. Gonna have to ask you to get over the side. Go on, get! You know how to-- to steer this machine, Don Juan? Why, shoot, anybody can drive one of these things. You get into trouble, you tie down the whistle. I'll come a-running. I'm going back in the boxcar now. Go on in there and drive it. - Me? - That's all. You can go to it. All right. Drink up. Come on. Don't be a party pooper. I guess he just doesn't like bourbon. Wait here. Here's looking at you. It's not that kind of a party. The olive is the best part, Wendell. Stick 'em up. Take 'em up, I say, all you dudes. Get your hands in the air. No, not you, muchachos. Just keep on a-playing. Set right there an keep playing, boys. Hey, yo, curly, What do you think you are, some kind of exception? Get your hands up in the air. Nicely staged, Barton. Only one thing. I don't think the old duffer's quite the desperado type. Get out of there, son. Aren't you in enough trouble with the law now, McCanless? Yes, I am in trouble with the law, Whittaker, trouble being I can't get none of it. What do you mean? What do I mean? Go on, play them guitars. What I mean is that's my herd right there. That's my herd, and I caught you red-handed. You rustled him, didn't you? Your herd is tainted, remember? Mr. Abernathy, Department of Health. How do you do? Yes, sir. It's all right here, right on that piece of paper. I'd be careful, Abernathy. Remember, I'm mentally unstable. Anybody will tell you that. I don't like to be crossed. Is that there herd diseased or ain't it? It wouldn't be sanitary to have him here in the parlor car if he was. I'll tell you what. Gather up your trinkets here, turn around, open that door, and jump off the train. Come on, do like I tell you. Now, go on playing, boys. Go right on playing. I could get killed. Go on, jump. That's the way. Here she comes. What are you doing? Get out of the way! Hey, that's Paco. Hey, Jimmy! Hey, Miss Amanda! Come on! Get a ticket! McCanless, you stubborn, muley old bull! None of you courtroom coyotes can sing worth a hoot. Just gather up your gear there and open the-- open the door there, barkeep. Just jump right off the train now. Go ahead. Do like I tell you! Oh, no, not you, muchachos. Now set down there and play us a little tune. That's the way. If that's the 12:02 from Topeka, she's two days early. Jimmy, he's gone. There's no one in the cab. Hey, what are you doing there, pard? How come you ain't driving the train? She don't need driver, Don Juan. She right on track. That's impossible. There's nothing due from your side for two days. I've got the next train from Albuquerque coming the other way in two minutes. Just thought you ought to know about it, that's all. Nobody ever tells me anything. The old mine switch. Oh, it's an awful mess. The line's broken in several places. There's no choice. Hey, Paco, go on up there and gentle her down some. There's Paco. Paco! Stop! Hey! What are you doing? Come on, get out. Hey! Get out of the way! He'll have to stop now. What if he doesn't? That. Much as I'm obliged to you, we've come to the parting of the ways. I've got some private business here with Mr. Whittaker. Here you are, sir. Mighty fine instrument you got there. Much obliged to you. Here you are. Here you are now. There you are, pard. Mighty beholden to you. Keep that door open there. All right, young fella. ?Muchas gracias! ?Viva M?xico! Well, Blackjack? That just brings it down to you and me, don't it? You ain't got your private army with you no more. Let's see what kind of man you are. Tell you what we're going to do, Blackjack. You and me are going to have a combat to the death. That's what them old Comanche chiefs used to do, just have it out between the two of them, see? That way, the young braves can stay out of it. They wouldn't get killed off. The squaws and the young'uns wouldn't have to starve for the winter. Makes a lot of sense that way, don't it? Don't you make any mistakes, McCanless. I don't bluff, and I don't scare. All right. There you are, Blackjack. Now stand up there. Get your hands over against your belt. Then we can play. You're even wilder than they say you are. Make a grab for it, you shoot it up, dude. Come on. Let's see if you got the guts. Where does this track end? At the mine. They should be getting there about now. Don Juan! Help! Don Juan. Don Juan! Juan! Don Juan! Don Juan! Yeah. Ah, Paco. Who did this? We ran out of track. I see. Are you all right? Sure, I'm all right. Look out. I got... unfinished business here. McCanless? Haah! Here I am. I'm ready when you are, Blackjack. Give me that pistol, boy. No, no, no, no, Juan. Give me that pistol now. Get out of here. Go on. Bullets are going to be flying in a minute. They're going to be shipping you home in a hog hide, Blackjack. Start slapping leather. McCanless, no! No, Wendell! No! - Don Juan! - McCanless! You fool! Looks like you win the pot, Blackjack. Why don't you pick it up? No. No, John. You can keep the ranch. I'm a mite trail worn for that now, Blackjack. Them two can handle that for me. And you, uh, Paco. You're the best partner I ever tied up with at drag. Look, Don Juan. We made it. Quivira. Sure. Why, it says... Why, that sure enough is, pard. It says Quivira. We-- We made it. - Yeah. - Quivira. The golden city. That's a-- Juan. Paco. Please don't go away, McCanless. Oh, please don't go... McCanless. I'm going to miss you. Goodbye, Paco. Be careful crossing the Rio Grande. Don't worry, se?orita. I could swim over, I can swim back. Good luck, compadre. Thank you for the animal. Bye. Hey, pard. Paco, how are you getting along back there? Is okay at drag! Everything's okay at the point. Now, Paco, tell you what we're going to do here. I'm going to cut us a notch in the wind. We're going to jounce this herd of ours down across that dust-devil desert. We're going to swim them across the Rio Grande, see? Clean into old Mexico. Then we're going out across them Sierra Madre mountains, get us a whole mess of tequila maybe a couple of them se?oritas, and dance with them till their eyes shine like diamonds. Tell them all kind of glorious lies about the gold in Quivira. You and me, pard. We're going to leave us a trail of houlihans what am. Yes, sir, pard, you and me. Each man must find A pasture green Somewhere beyond The western wind Out where a man can hear Freedom singin' in his ear And love, like lightning Touches him I know each hill Is high and wide But green pastures fill the other side And so I'll travel each trail And ford each stream And lie down in peace In a pasture Cool and green
