--== McEphie ==-- Put some more grass over there. Careful, careful! Take care of the cows, okay? Sure, boss. Leave it to me. Take care. Yes, boss. Thank you. All right. Go! Come on. Hurry up. Hey, boss! Sir Mando! Jojo! What took you so long? Sorry, sir Mando. We ran into a problem at the ranch. I had to fix it before I could leave. - Is that so? - Yeah. Are those the cows? Yeah, three of those are yours. There. They look a little hungry! You're seeing things, sir Mando! Look, they're sturdier than you are! Fine. Load them onto the truck. Where is your truck parked? Over there! Ah, okay. Boys, sir Mando's truck is over there. Load them up! Three of them. Double time! By the way, sir Mando. Three calves were born the other day. Luckily, the new pens were finished. There's so much space! Until next time, okay? Tell your boss I said hi. Sure, I'll tell him. Until next time! Take them there! Hurry up! - Jojo! - Yes sir! How much for a cow? They're at 70 thousand right now. Do you have any that's good for roast beef? At the moment, no. All these are for raising. Okay, thank you. Okay, next time! Hey, Sir Pedro! - Jojo! - I haven't seen you lately! You weren't here during the last sale! Sorry about that, Jojo. A storm wrecked the ranch. I'm actually here to buy new cows. Is that so? Come here, let's talk. How many do you need? I was hoping to get two. Two… 70 thousand each. Isn't that higher than before? That's the going price, sir Pedro. Alright, well I'm going to look around here. Come on, sir Pedro. Not so fast. Let's talk it out. Do you really need the cows for today? My truck is already here! Alright. 50 thousand. That's already fair. Come on, how about... give it for 30 thousand, so we'll be done here. You're a tough one to crack. But okay. I'll give it for ₱30,000 each… but you have to buy three. Sure, sure! Are we good? Yeah. But, is it okay if... I bring them tomorrow instead? Come on, Jojo. Why wait until tomorrow? Sir Pedro, don't worry about it! Just have your driver hang out for a bit. Tell him I'll meet him up before it gets dark. Okay, sure. Sir Pedro, wait a sec. What is it? Is it okay if... I get the downpayment? Here. Ten thousand. I'll give the remaining balance once you bring the cows to Batangas, okay? - I'll be waiting! - Okay! You can count on me, Sir Pedro! Alright! Take care, sir! Wait a minute, where are you going? To boss Antonio. Why? I'm handing over the money. He's at the firing range. Okay, boss. Thank you! Our buddy looks so young here! He'll be raking votes from the ladies for sure! Too bad we can't publish this yet. Why not? After he files for candidacy, we can. Perfect timing, it's his last term as congressman! Let's go sit down. How are our businesses? The recoil is strong! Excuse me, boss Antonio. Jojo! Here's the money from the cows. This is complete, right? Yes, boss! That's half a million. Good. Cousin! This is what we earned from the cows. - All of it? - Yeah. This is Jojo. Hello, Congressman. Thank you, sir. - Boss! - Karen, Yes, sir? Take care of this. Okay, sir. Go ahead. Congressman. Gentlemen. - Hey! - Oh, how are you! General, mayor... - How's it going, Cong. - Everything's good. Sorry, guys. We're just helping somebody out. You know how it is. We know, we know. Anyway, I have some news for you. I heard... They're passing the bill we've established at the Bicameral Committee. - The Ilaya International Freeport Zone! - Oh, wow! - That's great, right? - Couldn't be better! This is good news! - Tonio! - Yes, cousin? I'm recommending you as chairman for that! Thank you, cousin! - Hey, congrats! - Congrats, man! - That's great! - That's great! You know I've got your back, cousin. Thanks again! You really are the best. Hopefully the President can sign it before congress goes to recess. Congressman, are we sure that the free port's boundary will include the town of Santa Maria? General, I know what you're trying to say. I know what you want. Don't worry, - I'll make sure you're included. - Thank you so much, sir! The freeport is such great news, congressman! Especially for the farmers in Santa Inez. Mayor Bogs... you're right. You're absolutely right. I'll tell you what, there are plans to put up a food hub inside the freeport zone. So you may go and brag about that to your constituents! Thanks so much, congressman! Brag about it! I just want to let you know that... my vision for Ilaya will be impossible to achieve if... you guys wouldn't support me. - Well of course! - You have our full support! - I'll hold you to that! - Of course! - You've nothing to worry about! - We can't say no to you! Alright, Let's drink to that! Let's drink to that! Excuse me, there's an urgent matter. I need to talk to Nicole. Oh, sure. Cousin? - Yes? - Can you go with Nicole? Oh, okay! Come with me, girls! Come on. Watch your steps. Jojo! Yes, boss! Come join us! - Thank you. - Good afternoon, boss. Good afternoon. Let's eat, sir. Could you bring our visitors to the rest house? - Okay? - Sure thing, sir! Go on. Come on, follow me. Careful. - Sir! - Yes? I wanted to ask a favor. What is it? Could I go home immediately after work? Just need to settle something with the wife. Okay. Go straight home after bringing back the van. - Yes, sir. Thank you! - Here are the keys. Take care! Come on! Alright! Careful! Are you excited? A little. I promise, you'll enjoy it here! We're here, ladies. We're here? Yes, this is it! This is our stop. Thanks! Thank you! Enjoy! Come with me. I've got you! It's beautiful here! Here, this way. - Well? - Wow! It's gorgeous, isn't it? Yes! Come on, let's go here. Congressman's resthouse is so grand! It's a big property. I noticed. So... wanna go for a swim? Yeah, the water looks so good! Come on, let's get dressed! Let's go! The changing room's inside. Good afternoon, sir! Let's go. You don't have to follow me. Just park it somewhere properly. Yes, sir. Are you enjoying? Yes, it's so fun! I told you you'll have fun here. Karen! Yes, sir? Have you been waiting long? We just got here. Where are your guests? I left them with Antonio. He'll take care of them. It's not like they can do anything to you! Let's go. Let's go! How are you? How are you? I'm good! Alright. We're here. You drive fast, huh. Here, take this. Take care! Thank you! Hey! Have a seat! My wife's so pretty! Carmela, what's for dinner? Oh, wait. Let me prepare your dinner. Your food's here. Goddamn it, Carmela, this again? You didn't give enough money for the market. And I had to pay for electricity… Ouch! Jojo, you're at it again! Jojo! - Jojo, please! - That's what you want right? This is what you're good at! Jojo! Do as I say! It hurts! Jojo, please stop! Stop acting like you don't want it. Jojo! Stop, Jojo please! Son of a bitch! Stop fucking screaming. You know you want it! Jojo, stop it, please! There, you like that? You like that! Jojo! It hurts! Jojo! Jojo! Shut the fuck up, bitch! Jojo! Jojo, please stop it. Jojo! Jojo, that's enough! Shut up, you whore! Spread your legs! It hurts! It hurts! Fighting back but you're gonna cum anyway! Here! Get dressed! Hurry up, hurry up! Quickly, quickly! Hey! What's that! You fuckers! Stop! Fuck! Get down! Sir, please. - I have nothing to do with this. - We'll see about that! Get down! Sir, I've got nothing to do with this! - I'm just the driver! - Shut up! You sons of bitches. - Please forgive me, sir! - Forgive you? How long have you been doing this on the ranch? - Just this once! - You gonna to do this again? - No, sir, no!

Boss, please forgive me, boss! After I trusted you? I really needed the money, boss! Get in! Put him in jail! Sir, thank you. I catch you almost every day! - Here's the payment, sir. - Thank you. - Sir, - Yes, ma'am? did you catch anyone named Jojo Raymundo? Yes, how are you related to him? I'm his wife. Your husband's jailed inside. Just go up to the visiting area, I'll bring your husband to you. Okay, sir. Thank you. Alright. Raymundo! - Sir! - Jojo Raymundo! What is it, sir? Come here. Yes? You have a visitor. Okay, sir. Stand here. Okay, sir, thank you. Alright, come on. Here, here. Where to? Come on. Here. Thank you, sir. Carmela! What happened? Come on, Carmela.

Maybe you can talk to boss Antonio? Just ask him to get me out of here. I'm having such a hard time. Come on. Fine. I'll find a way. Sir, please look after my husband well. Sure thing, ma'am. Nothing will happen to him here. Take care of yourself here, Jojo. Yes, Carmela. I love you! I love you! You too, take care out there! How is it going over there? All good. My payment. Thank you! Sirs! Could I please talk to boss Antonio? Are you Jojo's wife? Yes. Get out of here. It won't take long. I just want to talk! - You're not allowed here! - Just for a bit, sir. I just want to talk to him! My husband is innocent! Are you going to leave or do I have to shoot you? You fuckers! You're all heartless! Whatever, leave! Don't forget, Fredie Ibasco! Alright, ma'am. Thank you! Drop me off here, sir. Here's my payment. Boss Antonio! Boss Antonio! Please have mercy on me! Please forgive my husband! Please, have mercy! Let go of me! Get her! Get her! Let go of her! Madam! Please help me, please have mercy on me and my husband! Please calm down for now. Give me a chair! Hurry up! Sit down for a bit, ma'am. Give me some water. I'm alright. No, drink some water first. Thank you, ma'am. What's your name, dear? Carmela Raymundo, ma'am. She's the wife of Jojo, the one who stole cows from our ranch. He's living with her. Both of you! Out! I will give you two five minutes to get the fuck out of my resthouse! If you don't, I will have you dragged all over Ilaya butt-naked! Out! You! We need to talk! What? Happy now? Are you proud of what you did? What about you? You're proud about what you're doing? Just so you know, I've been campaigning all day in every grimy corner of Ilaya for you! While you're just here befouling our rest house? Hey, hey! Calm down! Calm down? You don't even know our ranch is being robbed and you're asking me to calm down? What kind of leader are you? And you think you can run for governor? I talked to Antonio. He knows what to do. He can handle it. Now, what's your problem? Fred. I tolerate your womanizing in Manila. All I ask is that you stop it here in Ilaya. Give me some respect! If you can't respect me as a person, at least respect our standing in society! Listen. I don't display my philandering in public. I have maintained my image as a loyal husband to you. Now, if you can't stand my vices, that's your problem. I just want an open relationship. While I'm stuck with you? That's just your luck. You married a politician. Let's end this. What's so funny? Done. Wish granted! You're free. You asshole. Well, I'll be filing an annulment after the election. And don't worry. I'll pay for the legal fees to expedite the process. You asshole! Well, for now... you're still Mrs. Ibasco. Enjoy it. President Manuel Sevilla has signed the Republic Act 19123, or the Ilaya Free Trade Act. This aims to establish a Free Port area in the province of Ilaya. Present during the ceremony were Senate President Pacquito Meneses, House Speaker Amadeo Rodriguez and the co-authors, Alexandro Marquez and representative Fernando Ibasco of the third district of Ilaya province. Here, water. Your cousin's a fucking asshole! He can't even respect me! Amor! You were in Karen's position when he separated with his first wife! Just be thankful for where you are now. Madam! You can call me Mrs. Ibasco. What are you doing here, Mrs. Ibasco? Can I talk to you? Sure! Come inside. This way, ma'am. Sorry about our house, ma'am. Please have a seat! Have some coffee first. Thank you. Are you alone with your husband here? Yes, ma'am. Where are your children? Jojo is sterile. It's good that you were able to accept it. Being a mother isn't the only reason why a woman wants to get married. How romantic. Mrs. Ibasco? About my husband… That's why I'm here. What did Congressman say? Is he going to set my husband free? I appreciate your commitment to your husband, but unfortunately, my husband did not consent. Mrs. Ibasco… maybe I could talk to him. Please. I'm begging you. Wish granted. I can bring you closer to my husband, but on one condition. What condition? Have sex with him. What? For your first payment. I'll add more later. And you can set your husband free. Just make sure you make my husband happy. You can leave. Are you sure about this? Do you want your husband to rot in prison? It's hard to be alone, Carmela. No husband, no child… I have no time for your disgusting wiles. My appointment with you is done. You had your chance. Thank you for the coffee. Raymundo! Jojo Raymundo! Hey, Raymundo! They're looking for you! What is it? Get out of there! Okay, sir! Hurry, hurry! I was sleeping! Hurry! Okay, okay sir, I'm coming! Wait for me there. Yes, sir. Show me your hands. Here. Why are you putting handcuffs? Where are you taking me? Hey, Sir! What is this? No more talking! Wait, what is this? We're putting you in solitary! Sir, please! Please don't do this to me! Sir! Sir! Here's my fare. Thank you. Wait, wait. Sir? You can't visit your husband today. Why not? That can't be, it's still visiting hours! I'm telling you, no. Why, sir? Your husband's in solitary confinement. What? He was being a nuisance! Here. What's this? Call it. They might save your husband. Go on. You bitch! I wouldn't do that if I were you. What did you do to my husband? I did nothing to your husband. My husband is in solitary confinement! Well... It's his life. He could've been a bad boy, or perhaps someone else. Alright, Mrs. Ibasco. I'll do what you want, but please leave my husband and I alone. Yes, ma'am? Hello, Colonel? Please bring Jojo Raymundo out of solitary confinement. Okay, ma'am. Thank you. Wait! Get him out of prison! Not just out of solitary! My husband can answer to that, not me. Fine. Let's get this over with. Bring me to that damn congressman! Get in the car. Now. Wait a second. Why are we taking this route? - Carmela, take it easy. - This is wrong. - This is the right way. - Please stop the car! Stop the car! - Come on, please! - Go on, stop the car. Carmela! Where the hell are we going? To Manila. You didn't even let me pack? You don't have to! I'll buy clothes for you! Be honest with me, Mrs. Ibasco! Are you crazy or something? My husband is a sex addict. And it just got worse because of his damn secretary who whores girls out to him. And what do I have to do with that? When I saw you, I knew you would be my husband's type. Is that why you're going to whore me out to him? If you want your husband freed, you'll need to earn my husband's trust. Why are you doing this? Because I don't want to waste everything I've worked for! So you're competing with your husband's secretary? Is that why you're going to whore me out to him, too? Ten million pesos, cash. Are you crazy? You're disrespecting me, Mrs. Ibasco! This isn't about my husband's freedom anymore! So what I want is ten million pesos in exchange for my honor. Do you want me to have you killed instead? You can't do it. You need me. I could get someone else. Well, I guess, I'm going back home to Ilaya. Wait! One million, and I think that's enough. Two million. Fine. Deal. Get back inside. Let's sit here. Have a seat, guys. Oh my god. It's so early! What's this meeting about? Jake, this is Carmela. - Oh, hi, Carmela. - Hello. My constituent in Ilaya. Carmela, this is Jake Salazar, - my personal shopper. - Yes. And what is this all about? I want you to make her stunning! Enhance her beauty. Sexy or classy? - Both. - Oh! Why not? Reservation for Congressman Ibasco? Come with me, ma'am. Here's your reserved table. If you need anything, just call me. Where's my husband? Unfortunately, he will never be here. Please sit down, ma'am Amor. He wants you to sign this. But I want to talk to my husband. I'm sorry, Amor. Mrs. Ibasco. Mrs. Ibasco. What's the meaning of this? As I said, Congressman Ibasco wants you to sign the document. Tell your boss-- my husband-- that I'm not going to be insulted this way! Especially from some glorified whore like you! Excuse me. Welcome, congressman! I think we should listen to what our congressman is going to say. I think that's him. Good afternoon. Oh, good afternoon! - Hi, good afternoon - Congressman! Good afternoon. I'm sorry I'm late. - It's okay. - It's okay, Congressman. Guys, gentlemen, this is where we're going to build the free-port zone, as you can see. This is our zoning, our urban comprehensive, the aerial, the airport district, port business, and high-end manufacturing. - As you can see. - That's good. And here are our... - investors. - That's a lot! All of them. Okay, guys. I'll explain it to you. The Ilaya International Airport is expected to bring - 350,000 jobs - Wow! in just three years. Five million more jobs in the next ten years. Also, it will elevate the province of Ilaya from third to first class industrialized province. This will help our country. In order for this vision to materialize, I need your support because my competition in politics is using the Free Port to tarnish my reputation. Surely we're not willing to sacrifice the welfare of the people, just for someone's personal interests? We agree. Congressman Ibasco. What do you really want from us? Well, to tell you the truth, I'm planning to file my candidacy as governor of Ilaya. So guys, I need your financial support to run a campaign. What are we getting out of this? That's a good question. Free access to the Free Port. My cousin, Antonio Ibasco, will be the chairman of IIFP. And I'm sure he will be delighted to work with you guys. Antonio Ibasco? Isn't he facing tax evasion charges? Those are allegations only. But the lower court has already decided! There's no finality on that yet. Actually, he's still following up with the Court of Tax Appeals. Fredie, I hope you don't mind… You have an impeccable plan for your province. You just need to bet on the right people. Noted. Excuse me, sir. Your wife is on the phone. Gentlemen, guys, excuse me for a bit. I have important business to attend to. Okay, Congressman. What's the meaning of those annulment papers you sent me? That's it. Our agreement was after the elections! What do you mean after the elections? I sent it to you now, so you can sign them. You fucking monster! You're that excited to split up with me? Wait a minute, weren't you the one who threatened me with separation? This is what you wanted! Besides, this relationship isn't going anywhere! You're an asshole, Fredie! Go to hell! Go to hell! Where's my wife? She made me come here. Who are you? Meet my friend, Mela. Mela, my husband, Fredie. Hello, sir. Hello. Let's go home? Here's your coffee. Thank you. Good morning. Good morning. Come on, join us. Have you been together long? Five years? Please. Join us. Thank you. Do you have any children? I don't have any, by choice. But Fred's children are in the US with his first wife. How was your night? I don't know. I have no idea. Have you been doing this for a while? It's mine and Fred's first time having a threesome. Actually, I didn’t expect that Amor was that wild. Love, stop it! You should go to the office. Alright, love. You need to return to Ilaya. My presence needs to be felt there before I file my candidacy for governor. Sure. Use my driver, so you won't have a hard time driving. - Alright? Okay. - Thanks, love. I need to go. Nice meeting you, Mela. Nice meeting you, too. - Bye, love. - Bye. You can endure that? I worked hard to get to where I am today. And I'm not going to let that whore of a secretary to get what I have. I did what you asked. What about our deal? Don't worry. I'll send the two million to your bank account. That's not what we talked about. My husband's freedom. I'll tell Fred. That's going to be easy. And it seems like he likes you. Carmela? Can I ask you something? What is it? I saw the bruises on your body. I got into an accident the other day. Does your husband beat you? That is none of your business, Mrs. Ibasco. Amor. Call me Amor. I'm a woman, too. I know what you're going through. Then you shouldn't be dragging another woman through this shitshow for your personal gain! Ma'am, wait a minute. Wait, why? Boss said you should stay here. Huh? We didn't agree on this! Is this true? Yes, ma'am! Amor! We didn't agree on this, what now? Just a minute. Cannot be reached. Ma'am, you need to get going. Amor! I'm coming with you! Just stay here. I'm coming with you, Amor! Just stay here. I don't want to! - Amor! - Please. Just stay here! Amor! Amor, don't leave me here! Amor! Amor, I'm coming with you! Good evening, sir. Good evening. Park that. Is that how you greet people? To monsters? Yeah. Why did you imprison me here? I didn't imprison you. I just asked the security to keep you here until I came back. This is kidnapping, dipshit. Let's say... I just want to know you more. Okay. My name is Carmela Raymundo. I'm the wife of the thief who stole cows from your ranch. Your crazy wife forced me to have sex with you in exchange for my husband's freedom. Are we clear? You know me now? Please let me go, Congressman. I love your honesty. You and your wife are both crazy. Is that all Amor offered you? I'm sure there's more. Two million pesos. I can offer five times that. My husband's freedom is what I want. Wish granted. What do you mean? Your husband is now free. My job is done here. I'll give you ten million. Just stay with me, Mela. Jojo Raymundo! Yes, sir? You're free! I'm free? Yeah, don't you want to? I'm coming! Alright! Take care guys! Hurry up! I'm coming, sir! Hurry! Take care! I will, I will! Wait for me there. Take care, you guys! - Say hi to your wives for me! - Over there. Log out here. I'll go ahead, sir, alright? Yes, you're free now. I'm not going to do that again. Don't come back here alright? Never! I'm going to eat something delicious. Let's go, boss! Right there, sir. Here's my payment. Thank you! Carmela? Carmela? Carmela? Jojo? - Hey, miss Venus! - You got out! Yeah! Where's Carmela? Have you seen her? She hasn't come home for several days now. Is that so? Did she mention where she was going? Oh, no. And it's been a while since there was anyone in your house. Okay, I'll go. Thank you, miss Venus. Carmela, where are you? I wonder why the congressman called for us. Good morning, sir. Good morning to you all. I'll make this quick. As the 17th Congress draws to a close, I want to announce that I am laying off some people in Congress, including those in my own office. This means that only the transitional team will operate starting next week. The person I'm appointing as the interim Chief-of-Staff is Miss Karen Mendiaje. She'll be in charge of the transitional team. Don't worry! I'll find a position in my campaign for those who are laid-off. Because next week, I will file my candidacy for governor for the Province of Ilaya. So don't feel bad. I'd also like to introduce to you my new personal assistant. Carmela Raymundo. You may return to your tasks. Congressman, may I talk to you? Sure. In private. - Go inside the office. - Sure. Who told you I wanted to be the Chief of Staff for the transitional team? No one. I just said it. You didn't even think to ask me if I wanted the post? Wait a damn minute. Am I not in charge here? Fredie, my position is coterminous! If you're no longer in the chamber, I won't be there either! Are you trying to get rid of me? Is that what you're thinking? I think so! Because you've found a new personal assistant! Wait, wait… Shouldn't you just be grateful that I gave you work? A high position, at that! I should hear nothing but thanks. What about our relationship? What relationship? Fuck, Fredie! What are we? You are one of my women. My whores. Relationship? What relationship are you talking about? There is nothing between us! Now, if you don't want the position I'm giving you, you're free to go. You son of a bitch! My townspeople! My fellow Ilaoeños! I want to introduce to you the next governor of the province of Ilaya, Governor Fredie Ibasco! - Ibasco! - Long live Governor Ibasco! Long live! - Long live Governor Ibasco! - Long live! - Long live Governor Ibasco! - Long live! Gov, here. Thank you. Long live the Ilaoeños! This day was fated for me to express my love to my hometown. I wish to share with you that I started here as barangay chairman, went on to be mayor, and now currently as congressman. I was fortunate to have been able to pass a very important law to help raise our poorest from poverty here in Ilaya. This law will only gain importance if you elect me as your governor. Carmela! Next year will mark the enactment... Carmela! of Republic Act 19123, or the establishment of the Ilaya International Free Port Zone! Just think of the thousands of jobs that this will provide for our citizens right here in Ilaya! You're not allowed here! You're not allowed here! And I have more good news for you! I talked to someone with integrity a brilliant man, and I chose him to become the chairman of Ilaya International Free Port Zone. And it is none other than... Mayor Gerry Olivar! Let's clap our hands for Mayor Gerry Olivar! Gerry Olivar, ladies and gentlemen! Mayor! Until next time! This is Fredie Ibasco, your governor! Ibasco! Ibasco! Ibasco! Ibasco! Fredie. Amor, have a seat. Amor... Antonio's eyes almost fell out of his sockets when you announced that Olivar would be the chairman for the Free Port. I had to do what I had to do. The investors didn't like Antonio. You could have at least informed him in advance! It's the same, Amor! Remember? The document I was asking you to work on. That... needs your signature. But we're done with this, right? Did I say that? But... we've put this behind us, right? We're doing okay. You just need to sign! Fredie. Where is this coming from? Amor. Weren't you the one who threatened me with separation? You made me realize that I don't love you anymore. You monster! After everything that I've done to make this marriage work! Let's not make this difficult for either of us. I can blow your brains out right now. But I won't, out of respect for what we had together. So... choose. Very good! You know this isn't legally binding because you had a gun on me. Take it to court. That's if you live long enough. Cheers! Sir, ma'am is here. - Thank you. - Thank you sir! Good evening, Amor! Good evening, Antonio. Can I join you for a drink? Yeah. Sure! Help yourself. Thank you. Look at us. The loser's bench. Antonio? How do you tolerate Fredie's constant bullying? And you, Amor? How much longer can you endure his abuse? That demon will get what's coming to him. I am a much worse demon, Amor. What do you mean? When you're done moping, let's talk about how to get back at Fredie. - Cheers. - Cheers to that! For governor! - Ibasco! - Ibasco! Vote! Vote for! Vote! Vote for! - Ibasco! - Ibasco! Fredie Ibasco for governor! Not just for me but for the Ilaoeños, in the province of Ilaya! Carmela! Carmela! - Vote for! Vote for! - Carmela! Carmela! - Vote! Vote for! - Ibasco! Ibasco! - Carmela! - Ibasco! Ibasco! - Carmela! - You're not allowed here! Carmela! Carmela! Carmela! Carmela! Carmela! Carmela! Ibasco! Ibasco! Fuck, that's my wife! Carmela! Delicious! Hey, boss, what's going on? No more questions! Get him! Wait a minute! - Get up! - Get up! Enough with the questions, get him! - Boss! - Just follow us! Boss my ass! What did I do? Put him inside! - Hurry! - What is this? Boss! Boss, please! Boss, come on! Go! Boss! Boss! What did I do, boss? What have I done wrong? Jojo Raymundo, right? You're the wife of Congressman Ibasco, right? I'm going to cut to the chase. Your wife and my husband have a relationship. I know. I saw them during the proclamation rally. I had a hunch. Mrs. Ibasco, I tried to get to my wife, but I couldn't! My wife seems like a completely different person! You want to get your wife back? How? Give me the gun. What am I going to do with this?

Good afternoon, ma'am. Good afternoon, sir. Could we get a statement from you? It won't take long. Ma'am, did you know anyone who talked with your husband before he killed Congressman Ibasco? I don't know anything about that. The last time I saw Jojo was in prison when he got caught for stealing cows. Are you sure, ma'am? You haven't talked since then? Yes sir. I'm very sure. Okay, ma'am. My condolences, madam. I can't imagine what you're going through. Thank you so much for coming. - Help me find justice for my husband. - Condolences. Mrs. Ibasco, we'd like to offer our condolences. Thank you. Sir, ma'am is here. My condolences, Amor. I decided not to bring our children here anymore. But… we are truly mourning with your family. Thank you so much, Minerva. Do you want to see him? Yes, please. I remember so many good things in my relationship with Fredie. But most of all, he brought out the best in me. The night before he filed for candidacy, I remember telling him that I was nervous… The same nerves I had at the eve of our wedding. He even joked that maybe this was the sign that he should get married to the townspeople of Ilaya. So I am wholeheartedly giving my thanks for the unyielding support that you have for Congressman Fredie Ibasco. With so many of you who came to mourn with us, I know my husband's death was not for naught. So I shall make a promise to the Lord and to him, that I won't stop until I get the justice he deserves. I will make sure that the person responsible will be held accountable for my husband's death. Justice for Governor Ibasco! So I, Amor Ibasco, declare that I will run as governor for the Province of Ilaya. In place of my husband Congressman Ibasco. This is for you, my darling. Justice for Congressman Ibasco! Why did you bring me here? Go on, get inside. Ma'am is waiting for you. Who? Come with me. Follow me. Go on up. She's been waiting for you. It's over, Carmela. Amor, I don't want this anymore. You've gotten everything you wanted. Relax. I brought you here to help you. What's this for? We both suffered at the hands of our husbands. Now, we can get what we deserve. Are you asking me to leave? I just want you to relax, Carmela. Until the election ends. I'll take care of you. You abandoned me once before... when you left me with Fredie. How do you expect me to trust you? I couldn't do anything then. Like you, I was scared of what Fredie would do! Before he died, he forced me to sign this. He pointed a gun at me. I'm still scared about what could happen. Both of us are victims, Carmela. Fredie is gone! So is your husband! We're free! I will never abandon you. - Long live Governor Ibasco! - Long live! - Long live Governor Ibasco! - Long live! - Long live Governor Ibasco! - Long live! - Long live Governor Ibasco! - Long live!
