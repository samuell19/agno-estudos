How you doing, Loren? Great. What a great car! Thanks. What year is this? 1960. See, my theory is, 1960 was the prime year of our country. Kennedy was elected, Interest rates were four percent, And elvis presley was singin' "now or never." And no extravagance was spared on this here vehicle. Might not be new york city or miami down here, But it's got very strong points. And we're gonna have a good time. Great time together. That's our sign there, kids. Santa's Funland. That's where we're headed. Hi, darlin'! Hi. Hi. Hey, honey, come on over here. Look who I found. Hi, kids. How are you? Hi, sweetheart. Abby? Mm-hmm. Loren. I'm glad you all are here. I'm Fay. My gal. I-I'll get it. Charlie, why don't you, uh, show 'em around? I-- I haven't had a chance to finish your room, But, uh, well, we'll get to it later. That's all right. We'll take care of it.

The other goat over here, her name's helen. And this calf here... Her name's mathilda. Go ahead, introduce yourself. Look at you! What's the rabbit's name? I don't believe she has a name. Hey, baby. What do you think she is? Oh, molly. Definitely a molly. How do you like it? Well, it's something. Yeah. Well, I know it needs work. It took every penny I had to get it, But it's worth it. Little spit, polish and sweat, I can see hundreds of people amblin' down these streets, Money in both hands. What with disney world and epcot a couple hours north, This'll be the perfect place for people to stop en route. Little appetizer. Now, consider this. We're only 25 minutes away from the third-biggest interstate In the southern United States. Now, do you have any idea How many cars travel that road Each and every single day? No, sir. Neither do I. But you can bet it's plenty. Any market researcher could tell you that. And every one of 'em means money in our pockets. Here's where you'll be staying. Uh-huh. Hello. I know it needs a little work.

I think it needs a little work. Aah! Very funny. Hi, beautiful. Aw, you're such a hot dog. Ah! If x equals eight, Then y must be equal to what? Now, three times eight squared Plus one half y squared equals 264, right? And three times 64 Plus one-half y squared equals two-sixty-- Uh, david. Would you, please? Thank you. 192 plus one-half y squared equals 264. And one-half y squared equals sevent-- Would you kids, please? Y squared equals 144, right? What does y equal? Miss MacWilliams. It's okay, take your time. Miss MacWilliams? I can't say. The answer is 12. What was the matter? Didn't you think that was the right answer? I knew it was the right answer. Oh. Well, I bet it's tough comin' into a new school like this. No, I'm used to it. My dad was in the military, so we moved around a lot. He died? Both my parents died. I'm sorry.
