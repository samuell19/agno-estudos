This movie plays during June 1970. One of the hardest times for Brazilians. The economy indexes were over-performing. But politically the government was committed to fighting armed extremism. On one side, the left-wing subversion. On the other side, clandestine repression. Kidnappings, killings, excesses. Moments of pain and distress. Today, a page is turned on the history of a country that can not lose its future. GO AHEAD, BRAZIL is a claim against violence. Waiting tickets 48 and 49. - I have the 49. - 48 here. Damn, I went for a cup of coffee and almost lost the flight. Honey, can you get me two more seats, please? You'll need to wait for the next one. Miguel, please change with me. I have to arrive early in Rio. Take Marta with you, OK? Will you get upset? No. Thanks. Did you see it? Unnecessary jealousy you have. Do you still think that is necessary to pursue Jofre? This year Brazil will win the World Cup for the 3rd time. Yes, every time the team is booed indoors they end up winning outdoors. - Where are you heading to? - Hum? - Where are you going? - To the city centre. Want to share the taxi? Please get in. Last efforts to avoid the killing of former Argentine President Aramburu are in place. The president will be killed at any moment. He was kidnapped by the Peronist movement led by Juan Jose Valle. He was captured last Friday and found guilty for killing 27 persons in 1956. General Ongania government declared death penalty legal in Argentina. Carlos Lamarca was convicted to 24 years of prison for arms dealing. President Médici declared that people need to be aware the development of countries under a demographic explosion still needs to raise loans or international investment or to export natural resources to increase the national income. USSR deploys the Soyuz spacecraft. It's funny, we've been chatting but haven't formally introduced. My name is Jofre. Mine is Sarmento. I don't have a card. I'll find you later. Stop that car! Drive fast! - This is insane. What's happening? - Shut up and stay still! Pullover! Are you nuts? Stop with that! - Holy shit, I killed the guy. - Idiot! Here it is, the ratings champion radio show! Hello, fellow Brazilians! Today, 3 June 1970, the “little canaries” begin in Guadalajara the hunt for the third victory of the Football World Cup. After winning in 1958 and in 1962. Brazil is playing in the Group 3 against Czechoslovakia. Czechoslovakia scores! Everyone is already seat down! Thank you. - Has it started? - Not yet. Where's Jofre? Hasn't he arrived yet? He caught the plane ahead of me. The Brazilian squad enters the pitch. Félix is the goalkeeper. Carlos Alberto, Brito, Wilson Piazza and Everaldo. Clodoaldo, Gerson and Rivelino. Jairzinho, Tostão and Pelé. A crowd of 80 thousand on the stands. I wanted Saldanha to be the coach. The new coach knows nothing. Do you know what I've heard? They cuted Saldanha because he won't put Dario in the team. The orders came directly from the President... And how come that there was nothing in the newspapers? Come on, we are on guerrilla. The papers don't say a thing. Here comes Veselý. The winger is in a promising position. And Czechoslovakia misses a fantastic chance! The ball is with Jairzinho the “World Cup Hurricane”. Go Jairzinho, go! Here comes the King Pelé crossing the ball. But Clodoaldo misses the goal. Sir Geraldo! What a great opportunity the national team has missed. But we are creating lots of chances and playing very well. Brazil zero Czechoslovakia also zero. Mr Rubens get this table cleaned immediately. Are you all crazy? Sir Geraldo, the truth is we were only expecting you tomorrow. Very well, tell the employees that they can watch the game. Goal! Czechoslovakia scores. Petráš with the jersey number 8. You are all dismissed for the day. Bullshit, we didn't watch Czechoslovakia's goal. The Czechoslovakia goal hasn't demotivate the Brazilian players. Pelé is entering the box and he is fouled. It's a free-kick. Rivelino is shooting and it's a goal! Brazil! Gerson crossed to Pelé, received it with the chest, and he scores! Goal! Hello! Baron's Pub. Yes, he is here, I'll call him. Brazil! Brazil! Brazil! Hello Marta. How did you find me here? Have you watched the game? Call Marcelo! Botafogo! When are you going to support Botafogo like your dad? The game was all about Jairzinho and Pelé! During the Cup I support Brazil! Your daddy must be euphoric, can I spoke to him? Mummy he wants to speak with daddy. Go to bed, tomorrow we will see daddy. You are certainly better informed then me on the Jofre's whereabouts. What? Really? No, he didn't come to the office. Maybe he watched the game at someone's place. Marta? Are you going to cry because of this? Miguel, he doesn't love me anymore. - He stopped caring about me. - Marta stop. Jofre adores you. Martinha, go to bed. Maybe something happened and he'll arrive shortly. Tomorrow we'll speak again. Bye. I'll destroy this motherfucker. Look how his wife is hot. So, are you going to speak or not? What a piece of ass. What do you want me to speak about? Sir! Call me Sir Barreto and we'll get along better. Have you seen these legs? - Be respectful, that's my wife. - Lower your voice. - Tell me about Resende. - I don't know who Resende is. I don't know who Resende is, Sir. Barreto. I don't know who Resende is, Sir Barreto. Who was your friend in the taxi? I had just met him on the plane. His name was Sarmento. Don't you want to go home? I can help you, but you need to speak. - But what? - Everything. The truth. But tell me. I catch a plane. Then there's this doomed guy who offers me a ride. Saying that we are going to the same place. That guy is a thief, a terrorist, I don't know what he is. And I end up in his place. What do you want me to say? That I'm the guy? That I know the stuff on his head? I am not associated with any groups. I don't mess with politics. You are improving. Who spoke about groups? Who spoke about politics? Are you taking me for an idiot? This guy is a pain in the ass. Cooperate, damn! You have one minute to tell me everything. Please be calm, Sir Barreto. We will discover everything. It can be quick, or it can be hardworking. It's up to you. - Mrs Marta? - It's me. - It's the Police. - Police? Is your husband's name Jofre Godoi da Fonseca? Yes. What do you need? - Is he home? - No Sir. What do you want from him? Please deliver this document to him. It's an intimation requiring a testimony in the Police Station. Testimony about what? What happened? Tomorrow he will discover. Please warn him. If he doesn't attend things will turn bad for him. Honey, I want to request something. Don't call me again. Are you insane? - That's it. I don't want to see you again. - Why? Please, Miguel don't ask any more questions. Are you seeing someone else? No. It's your life, I'm OK with that. It's your independence and I accept that. It's your group meetings, right? You think you'll solve all Brazil's problems? OK, I do not agree but I keep my distance. - Am I bothering you? - Forget it, Miguel. You will not understand. The impression I get is that you want to live your life eternally as a student. Honey, I love you. I also love you, Miguel. And that is the problem. - You can't understand it, right? - Yes, I can't. It's nothing. I just want you to never reach me anymore. - But we were getting along so well. - Well, how? Things are awful. The school, the ranch, the farm, the children. Everything you wanted. - What happened to that? - It's gone. Miguel, we have the same beliefs. Our world views are so alike. But is not working. You think things change by themselves. - Bye. - No, no, no. I'm not a child anymore. I know that I'll never find someone like you. Then I'll need you to join. Come with me. Everyone has its time and its turn, remember? Sometimes that time brings us together. And others tear us apart. Please, Miguel let go of my arm. Please leave me. Stop that, Miguel. I don't like it. You should open the door. Marta? What are you doing here so late? Jofre hasn't arrived yet. The Police were searching for him. The Police? This is Mariana. This is my sister-in-law. - Hi. - Hi. They are looking for Jofre, Miguel. Have you met a friend of your husband. Or some colleague, called Sarmento? Never heard of that name. I'm so nervous, please tell me what my husband did. Yesterday a car crash happened in town. The taxi driver and a guy called Sarmento died. The evidence shows that your husband rode that taxi. Three individuals were seen. But the third disappeared. And how is my husband related? By coincidence, a business card of your husband was found in one of the bodies. Is that enough to incriminate someone? We don't know this Sarmento. But the driver has a criminal record. Problems with drugs. Did you knew that drugs are connected With the subversion movements? I'm not following you. My husband has no relation with either of those matters. So where is he? Why didn't he reply to the intimation? I don't know! He was supposed to have arrived yesterday. Officer something happened to him. We were in São Paulo and couldn't come together. He flew before me and I saw him entering the plane. Are you Jofre Godoi da Fonseca? I already told you that I'm his brother. Mr Jofre is obliged to be here in person. You can leave. If your husband is hiding and you know his location. Tell him to come here quickly because his situation is getting worse by the minute. And that's it. I'm almost believing that you don't know where your husband is, Mrs Marta. Please, this way. But we'll end up finding him. But write it down. Mrs Marta da Fonseca and Mr? Miguel Godoi da Fonseca. Attended this Police station. Answering an intimation to Jofre Godoi da Fonseca. Mrs Marta declared that she is not aware of her husband's location. Booked under that name we have no one. But in the ICU, we have two in a coma that were not identified. Fonseca? Today no one entered under that name. Yesterday neither. The day before... Also no. Not here. Thanks. Not here. Is it your father? It's my husband. Has he vanished? My dear god. This is madness. Have you ever been there? Do you know that place? No. I don't know São Paulo that well. How do you know it is São Paulo? Shut up. I don't know... it seems like it. Isn't it? And this lady? I don't know her. But she knows you. She saw you many times with Resende. It can't be. I only met him on the plane. You lie! It was here. You are that guy, right? I don't know that guy. I have nothing to do with Resende. You lie! Here you are, right next to Resende. - Isn't that you? - No. For God's sake, I want to leave. Let me leave! I don't have nothing to tell, damn! Respect me! I do not respect you! - Shut your mouth! - I won't! Respect me, you motherfucker. I will not respect you! I will not fucking respect you. You will respect me all right. - Hello? - Hello Marta, it's your mum. Hi mum, how is Friburgo? Has that rascal appeared yet? Mum don't say stuff like that. Jofre was always a good husband and father. There are no good men. You should already have learned that. We must always be cautious. He never fooled me. Too fake for my taste. - If you need anything, call me. - OK, I'll call you. No, it is nothing like that. It's much more serious. All right. By God's will everything will end well. I'll warn. Oh my god. What a nightmare. Something new? Until now, nothing. He hasn't been in the office. I've been buying the newspapers every day. How come that two people die and the papers don't say a word? Probably it is the Police that doesn't allow it. - And can they do that? - Censorship Marta. They say that they are preparing armed combat. Yes, armed combat. Why is this not published? Rubens, Marta thinks that we are in Switzerland. What do you mean by that? What has one thing got to do with the other? Nothing Marta. I'm just telling you that there is censorship. Dear God! What have they done to Jofre? Hello. Yes, it is here. It's from the Police? I'm her brother in law and his brother. How? They found someone similar to Jofre. How similar? Where? OK. I'll get there. Where? Forensic institute. No. This is curious, Mrs Marta. We being suspicious on you and you being suspicious of us. It's natural. There is so much banditry and violence. It runs in our blood. We were colonised by who? By gays, bandits and exiles. Mix it with Indians and creoles... That's right. I've never seen such a naughty nation. You for instance. You may have lived years with your husband but not know him. Brazilians... Mrs Marta They are no good. We will find your husband, Mrs Marta. We will end up finding him. Do you know how many fugitives we have in this city? Thousands. Condemned, thieves, terrorists. All loose on the streets. It's too much work. The Police can't handle it. But in what I can do to help, I'm at your service. Thank you. It's good to know that someone from the Police is interested. Don't you have an uncle who is a general? Maybe he could help us. Maybe he is in jail. Miguel, why would he be in jail? Today everybody is being arrested. Your uncle must know that better than me. That there are lots of persons in jail, everybody knows. I don't know anything. Come on Rubens. That's it. Maybe your uncle can locate Jofre. - Could you talk to him? - Yes, I could. But I don't have his contact with me. Rubens, be honest. Tell them that you don't want to be involved. Have you lost the number Olga? You have to reprimand the maid! Go fuck yourself. All right. I'll figure it out. What can we do? Olga cannot find the address book. But I'll speak to him. - What's that? - Boy, you don't do that you can get hurt. I wanted to speak to you. Want to grab a beer? And the fella that died? Who was he? No one knows. Fake ID on the name of a Mr Sarmento who doesn't exist. And the shots? How do you explain them? Shots? The Officer didn't speak about shooting. This guy is a moron. Do you think that you are a witness? Are you trying to appear on the newspapers? You watched them shooting the car? I did. Two machine guns fired the car. When the taxi stopped two guys picked the one who survived. Boy, stop telling the story! Are you crazy? Let's go, Mr Miguel. Many people watched it! Everybody is afraid of testifying. They're just scared of the Police. But I will testify if you want my friend. Mr Miguel, you will waste your money. Listen to my advice, let it go. Stay out of this, let us do our job. But how? My brother is missing and not even the Police know where he is. How can I let this go? Being honest I don't even know if this case will be managed by Rio's Police. Soon we will receive orders to transfer the case to the federal Police. Don't worry. They are really efficient. Let it go. Mrs Sarmento. Mrs Sarmento. Please sign here. Please deliver this to the clerk. - Are you his wife? - Yes. Just a moment. No. It's not him. Luís, who is she? She's looking for her husband Sarmento. But it's another guy. Luís, I think that the lady was already in here. Miguel, it's Marta. Thanks. Hello Marta. - Did you go there? - Yes. I was scared to death but I went. That Sarmento guy was killed. The story was not well told. I already knew that. He was shot with a machine gun. Yes, a machine gun. Miguel, someone is chasing me. Keep calm, it must be only an impression. Go to the Passeio sidewalk and I'll meet you there. Hello? Marta? You are arrested. So Mrs Marta? How do you explain this? The explanations must come from you. You told it was an accident and it comes out that the guy was shot. The pub waiter was the only one who wanted to testify and now he is missing. And no one can tell us even his address. You know quite well that my husband is not called Sarmento. But I wanted to be sure that you are lying to us, and now I am. I want my husband back. The Police are responsible for finding him! What happened to him? I was in the taxi union. I found out that the taxi driver does not have a criminal register as you said. So Officer, how do you explain this? I already told you that I'm the one making the questions. It's better for you to leave the investigations to the Police. Go home and stay still. Otherwise, things will turn really bad for you. Trust me. His profile is very god. The information from the Human Resources are great. But that security business nowadays is a really serious matter. You are insane. There's not a slight change that Jofre is involved with drugs. Even less with subversion. It was just a completely absurd hypothesis that I created. So we will show up. A man like you, so well positioned. Well respected within the Government and with the Minister. You can help. I can't use my friends to ask them for a husband who left home! For me, this subject is closed, Mr Miguel. Closed. Thank you, Sir Geraldo. Thank you for your interest. Please be calm. You must see that these are extraordinary times we are living. Sir Geraldo can't expose himself like that. Expose how? Imagine that you are right and he is subversive? He is not a fucking subversive! Mr Garcia, you can enter the room. Even if he were. He is my brother, your friend, your colleague. We must do something. Have you spoken to your uncle? No, I haven't found the number. I'll call him from home. Mr Rubens Sir Geraldo is calling. Keel calm honey. Don't be like that. I don't like to see you nervous. Sit down, Garcia. Please inform the Human Resources that Mr Miguel is fired. Warn him. And Mr Jofre, if he shows up, is also fired. If he doesn't show up it's even better. Now leave! Jofre! Are you going to speak now? Who are you guys? Who do you think you are? Now let's see if you'll spill it or not. The game already started! Cheer for Brazil boy. Mifflin in the left to Cubillas. Cubillas comes down the flank but loses possession to Carlos Alberto. Who do they think they are? Dear God, who do they think they are? What am I doing here? I was always neutral. Apolitical. Never done anything. Never harmed anyone. I'm not one of those who are against. I'm a regular man. I work. I have a job. Papers. I have a wife and children. I pay my taxes. No one has the right to do this to me. It had to be with me, damn. What about my rights? Stuff like this... It can't happen. To nobody. To nobody. I'm leaving, the game is already won. Who is that Garcia that sometimes is with Sir Geraldo? I'm angry with you. Two to one Brazil is winning in Jalisco. Jairzinho goes through the middle. Pelé tries to receive the ball, kicks it and it is in the net! Goal!!! Zé Roberto? Hi. Our comrades call me Tânia. What about Resende? Yeah, it's hard to believe that he has fallen. Such a good guy. Incapable of being mean. Always thinking about the others. They had no mercy. Gunned him down. Had they caught him alive... It would have been worse. Yes, you are right. Who was the comrade that was with him? Nobody knows. Brazil four Peru two. Goals from Rivelino, two from Tostão and one from Jairzinho. Mariana? It's a friend of mine. Go ahead I'll catch up. So nice to see you. I'm sorry Miguel but I can't talk to you. Bye. Why do you keep running from me? I can't Miguel, please. I love you. I love you too. Were you dumped? Help me, please. Sir Geraldo is an important person, highly influential. - Would you help? - Sure honey. - Sorry for bothering you. - It's nothing dear. Today at the office my brother-in-law was a bit nervous. And Sir Geraldo fired him. - Could you do something? - Well, darling... I don't mess with Geraldo's work. He knows what he is doing. By chance, he commented with me what happened, it's not his habit. - That he fired two workers today. - Two? - And don't you remember their names? - Can't remember... It wasn't Jofre. It was a Miguel, who should be your brother-in-law. And the other was a something Fonseca. But Fonseca is my husband, Godoi da Fonseca. Then I don't know. I can be wrong. Isn't Fonseca your brother-in-law? They are brothers, both are called Godoi da Fonseca. So the other one was not Fonseca. Well I can be wrong, I'm not sure. It can be Fonseca and not Jofre, right? It wasn't Jofre, of that I'm sure. - About Jofre, will you help me? - I'll speak to my husband. Pedro, calm down the dogs. Today the home security is a serious matter. I'm scared to death of Geraldo being kidnapped. They have a list, it's said. Please go, don't be frightened. Still. These persons who love to disturb the others... Why do you have to receive this kind of person? - Are you a moron? - What do you want me to do? These kinds of people exist! Yes, please. What's this? Who are you? Wait? What's this, my friend? It's a matter of habit Mr Miguel. Since Getúlio times that they have this custom. Since the Federal Police times they've treated people this way. Some are very rude, others are more polite. But you haven't seen anything yet. You know Mr Miguel, the country is passing some difficult times. I've noticed... Please, don't misinterpret my kindness. He said that the newspapers are being censored. Do you have access to the unpublished reports? Have you read the cake recipe of the "Estado de São Paulo" newspaper? Any of your friends is a reporter? Friend, no. An acquaintance? From which newspaper? "Jornal do Brasil" and "O Globo". Reporters? Columnists? Advertisers. Sometimes a journalist interviewed me about my work. What kind of work? Machines, motors. The company I worked for builds roads in the whole of Brazil. Roads... do they work with explosives? Yes. Do you travel frequently? A lot. What are you trying to say? What do you know about armed combat? Me? Armed combat? Nothing. Which terrorist organizations do you know? What the hell? What do I have to do with that? Some days ago you were saying that armed combat was being prepared! - Me? - Yes! And that the Police doesn't authorize for it to be published! When? Where? - Do you have lots of friends? - No. - I thought I had more. - Where is your brother? He's missing. Why? Do you know where he is? - Does your brother know lots of people? - The same that I do. We worked together. Has your brother ever shown interest in exotic ideologies? How would you define your brother politically? Apolitical, like me. Like you. You are so funny. I'm warning you that we are not joking. I'm well warned. Take care of what you say. You may not know but we're at war. And our enemies speak Portuguese. Don't have accents, don't have another race. Are like us, from here. Brazilians. But traitors. You're free to go. You can't leave town. If you hear from your brother let us know. From now on, we are also looking for him. The bridge between Rio de Janeiro and Niterói will be finished ahead of time. The German ambassador kidnappers reveal the name of the hostages. And demand boarding in 36 hours. The government has accepted the prisoners exchange. Main suspects are Carlos Lamarca, Joaquim Câmara Ferreira "The old guy". Hey Marta. Miguel where have you been? I've been looking for you. Went for a spin. I know you... what have you been up to? Have you spoken to the wife? What did she say? That she would try to help, but only regarding Jofre. As of me, she wouldn't mess with the husband's business, right? He will not move a finger. I know that son of a bitch. Sorry, now it is fashionable to curse in front of women. Do you think that a terrorist group kidnapped Jofre? Are you crazy Marta? Since when Jofre is important? For you, he is the most important person in the world. She told me that was scared to death of Geraldo being kidnapped. And as Jofre works with Sir Geraldo... Sir Geraldo is one thing and Jofre is another. One is the boss and wealthy and is deeply involved in this shit. The other is only an employee and broke. How many persons were fired yesterday? As far as I know only me. She said two. The other was also called Fonseca. It's not possible - Have you spoken to Rubens? - No. - Hello? - Hello Olga. It is Miguel. I wanted to speak with Rubens. Is he there? Rubens? Yes he is here. Just a moment. - Hello. - Hello Rubens. - Have you spoken to the general? - No. All right. Thank you then... Miguel, what will you do? Look for Jofre, and now for a job also. It's hard... Didn't you think it was a little harsh of Sir Geraldo firing me? You were rude to him. - And it wasn't the first time. - Just because I spoke about subversion? I told you that they're renewing the staff. It's just natural that they sack the ones who don't respect the boss. And what he has to do with subversion? Why did he fire Jofre too? Who told you that he fired Jofre? Miguel, the general is out south, I couldn't reach him. I must leave now, I'm late. All right... all right... But Sir Geraldo fired me just because I mentioned subversion! Miguel why do you have to say such things over the telephone? Rubens is a pussy! You will die with no friends! You're hiding something from me. I was arrested yesterday. Questioned all night. Some bullshit I said and someone exposed me. - Rubens? - I don't know. It was nothing. They questioned and let me go. It is not related with Jofre. They also don't know where he is. So Jofre is also unemployed? I think so. My dear God, what will we do? I just wanted to know how Geraldo is involved. What is Sir Geraldo Braulen doing? My friend, you can't touch that. I wasn't touching it, only opening it. You can't do that either. Suddenly there's a malfunction and the whole-building loses the telephone line. - What's your apartment? - 201. It's working, what's the issue? Nothing, there was this thing but if you say that it's working it's fine. What is that wire? - Which one? - The brown. Did you gave an extension to somebody? No. - Not even to another building? - No. Your telephone has an extension. Was it approved? There's another device connected to your telephone. - This is forbidden. - I didn't give an extension. What's your name sir? Miguel Godoi da Fonseca. Either way, I will have to notice the company. - Hello. - Hello Marta, it's Miguel. You were right. My telephone is malfunctioning. It's affecting the whole region. If something pops up please find me at home. My darling, the subversion matter is very serious. In this case, I'm perfectly sure that the Senator wouldn't lift a finger. Even for his own son. Dear God, who told that my brother-in-law and my husband are subversive? Who said that he abandoned his job? He vanished, it's different! Something happened. Some kind of mix-up. Maybe he was arrested but I'm sure that he is innocent. You are being so naive, honey. If he suddenly vanished it's because he is undercover. He must be robbing banks and kidnapping ambassadors. No! No! My husband is not like that. You're only saying that because you don't know him. Your husband may be a monster without you knowing. Subversive people are that way. It is said that they have lists of important people to kidnap and kill. I don't even want to think about that. God forbid if something happens to someone from our group. But my husband pertains to your group! He works for a company of this group! Unfortunately I can't help you. We've just finished watching the most difficult game of Brazil here in Mexico. All of us were thirst for revenge after the defeat in 1950 in the World Cup Final to Uruguay by 2-1 in the Maracanã Stadium. The German ambassador returned home at 23h28m. After an abduction that lasted 123 hours and 28 minutes. We hope to achieve our final goal by winning the last adversary. Now everyday is this shit? We can't even work! You over there! Pullover. Officer, I'm in a hurry. Haven't had a client today. Other taxis can go through. Come on! Rio's cost of living increased 1.4% in May. Taxis can go through! Bullshit! As if I was not already suffering from bad luck! We cheered when Clodoaldo draw the match in the first half. Tânia? They shot Parelho! I was wondering if you could pass. What happened? Are you hurt? Gunfire outside the bank. Let's go, let's go! - Mariana? - Her arm. If Brazil wins it will be the tri championship! After the wins in 58 and 62. My god... what have they done to you? It's my sister-in-law. There is no danger. Try getting rid of her. Fast. I'm going. Miguel, I'm so tired. I will create a scandal. I will speak to all the newspapers! I can't stand it anymore! Nobody helps us! They think it is the subversion and are frightened. Always talking about a list and getting terrified. What list? Of deaths and kidnappings, I don't know. Geraldo's wife had already mentioned it. Sir Geraldo Brauleo, that motherfucker is involved in this! Go home, Marta. I'll meet you there later. Come on Miguel, let me rest a bit. Do you have coffee? I'll make one. What's this Miguel? Blood? Stay still. Turn the pillow around. I'm sorry. We had no alternative. We'll leave tomorrow. - What time is it? - Almost midnight. Miguel, soon they'll think that I also vanished. Can you tell them that I have to leave? Otherwise, the kids will get crazy and will search for me here. The lady will remain here. Until we leave. Wait a bit. She needs to leave. She won't leave. Listen up, my friend. Having problems with both sides, it's too much! Let hear leave Zé Roberto. It is dawn. This time I won't let you leave. Let go of my arm. Are you aware of what's happening to our country? Of course I'm aware. Do you think I'm blind? That's even worse. You got too comfortable. Do you think that is right to fight one dictatorship to fall under another? What's up? Our group... the ones that didn't fell, left. We'll have to form a new command, but for now, we won't work together. Wait, you're implying that I should stay? - Are you? - Bye. I'll not quit fighting. Stay here to hide for a while, all right. But find me another place, OK? I'll come and get you. Is it really fine for me to stay? I think yes! Well I don't know but not for long. Soon we'll find another place. I hope that you won't regret it. We can have a real-life together. We can't Miguel. I'm not Mariana anymore. And your brother, are there any news? Has he fallen? I'm starting to like you boy. Hurry up or we will be late and your aunt won't like it. Mummy will you be sad if I'll support Botafogo as daddy? My love. Calm down! Just a moment, I'm coming. What's happening here? - Wait! - Fast! Don't you bother me! Wait be calm. You don't need to push. You stay here! My wife is inside. I've already seen women before! I'm not scared of them. All right calm down. - Call the uncle. - What's this? Rubens do something. It's all right. I'll handle it. What's this? Don't push, damn! You don't need that tie! You know with who you are dealing? My uncle is a general. I know everyone in the Police Department. Let's go, let's go! - Good morning Sir Rubens. - Good morning. Who are you? Drive. This is an absurd! Where is this going to stop? Where's Olga? What happened? Honey what has Rubens been up to? Is there any explanation for this? No uncle. None. - What's up? - It's Jofre. Marta's husband. He also disappeared. No one knows how. I'm sorry I have an appointment now but I'll call you later. Her husband, do you know him well? Why didn't Rubens informed me? Do you trust him? Couldn't he be subversive, for example? Uncle no, for God's sake. Rubens didn't want to compromise. But Jofre is a moron just like him. Marcelo! Fernanda! - Hi Marta. - Hi Mariana. - Where's Miguel? - Not here. Went to Rio. Let's go, let's change those clothes. - Hello? - Geraldo? Oh my God, I'm so worried. With what honey? A bomb! That voice again... Saying that you're going to die. An awful thing. Saying that they will plant a bomb in your car. Answer me, honey! I thought that I was never going to see you again. You vanished. Verinha, who's that Garcia that lately was visiting Sir Geraldo? Who? I already mentioned him. He was there when I was fired. As far as I know, he is not Sir Geraldo friend, client, or seller. What the hell does he do there? I don't know Miguel. I know nothing. I thought that you were interest in seeing me. Be calm, I was only curious. Sit down. Thank you very much for your company but I must leave. - I'll take you there. - There is no need. Bye. - Miguel, you're hurting me. - Tell me what you know. I know the same thing you do. He's not a friend, a client, a seller, he is nothing to Sir Geraldo. He goes there only to receive cash. Now, let me go. If your life is complicated don't start complicating mine! Don't be scared. I came to ask you a favour. - I want you to help Me? - You? - What made us that familiar? - Yourself. You will book an appointment with Garcia and I'll go with you. Do it! - Hello, Mrs Vera? - Place a direct call! I want to talk with Mr Garcia, please. No, it's nothing... please tell him that Mr Geraldo called. Yes, himself. Garcia is not there. No problem, I'll wait. I can't meet Garcia. I can't go to his office. - I will be signalized. - Signalized how? Speak up or I'll shoot you in the mouth. I didn't want... - I don't do this because I want to. - This what? - This... give money To Garcia. - Money for what? To fight the subversion. Worm. Why do you do that? - Is it a governmental institution? - No. - It's groups. - What groups? People... volunteers... Why do you do that? For what? I am obliged. There are lots of highly influential people who contribute. And I can't be excluded. Why? I lose credit... I lose competitiveness. I would be persecuted... the company could be bankrupt. I am obliged to contribute but I swear that I don't like to do it! You... And Jofre... You are a communist, right? You crazy faggot! Communist my ass! Are you going to kill me? The telephone is ringing. Hello? Garcia? Geraldo, did you called me? Yes, I want to talk to you. All right. Tonight we have a session, wanna come? - Well... - What session? They happen sometimes. Some of us attend. - Attend what? - Questioning. - Today there's one. - Say that you'll go. And that you'll bring a fellow businessman who wants to join. Speak! Hello Garcia. Sorry, it's a mess here. My secretary entered the room. All right... can I bring a friend? It's a friend who's a businessman. He also wants to contribute. If you trust him there's no problem. - Bye then. - Bye. You won't do that with me, right? You will stay calm and smile. You will be really nice. Otherwise, I'll blow up this. You know the damage this generates, right? He must stay up without sleep. Translation to Portuguese. Translation to Portuguese. Translation to Portuguese. Translation to Portuguese. Translation to Portuguese. Translation to Portuguese. I'll stay here. You have until tomorrow to find my brother. But how? Find a way or I'll kill you. But I didn't do anything to arrest him. - Nothing. - Yes, you did. You're a friend of them. You support them. You're just like them. Next time the gun will be real. I hate blood... before it was worse. I used to vomit. - What's up? - Nothing. I want to see your prisoner. - Which one? - The one who knew Resende. This man is almost dead. You irresponsible moron. Now that he is almost speaking? I catch him, soften him and you take the credit? He is really hard you know. He says that he doesn't know Resende but I'm sure that he even knows Lamarca! And you won't take him because he is mine! He is mine! Let go of me! And he will stay here until he talks! Let go of me! You can stop it! So... you want to take him? I would kick your ass to death if you weren't so well connected! Don't you know that this man is important? You can take him. But I want to see you taking something from him. Go ahead and speak up that today I'm feeling impatient. Speak what? Everything you know about Resende. - For God's sake! - Fucking speak! I already said that I don't know any Resende. You know! Tell us about Resende! Listen Geraldo, don't try to trick me! Such a piece of information... how am I gonna get it? I know that you do not pertain to any groups. Miguel listen to me. Let's forget this. It's better to quit while you have time. Let's forget it all and I'll let you rejoin the company. Sir Geraldo Braulen! Your time is up! Start running! For me, you are a dead man! Wait! Wait! - I know... - Spill it! He... he messed with a guy called Resende. What's that? I don't care about Resende. Jofre... is dead. Yes Miguel, dead. Where? - Where is he? - Somewhere in São Paulo. Miguel please, I don't know anything else. They just added... that it is a lost of time to even search for the body. Not even the body? You killed Jofre and aren't even going to deliver his body? Yes. They make the corpses vanish. Miguel, you understand my situation. For God's sake. I won't move a finger against you. I don't have any power. I'm also a victim! Miguel, please say something! - They will retrieve Jofre's body. - That's foolish and childish. You would call it politics. You are being passionate and that is not politics. Yes, it has. I'm not the idiot you think I am. Wait you can't go. You must stay with Aunt Mariana. Miguel, Miguel! Let's go, it's time to eat. You didn't walk away from the car for a single moment right? No madam. Dear God that bomb thing happens every day, we just don't know. Bombs and shootings... Dear god. I hate New York in June, but with this situation is would be better to be there! Shut up! - He is with his wife. - I'll take out the driver. Stop! I forgot my watch on the bed. You two leave now! Mind your own business. This motherfucker is one of the responsible for torture in Brazil. - Get out! Fast! - I'm trying! Leave by the other door that the guy is demanding! Some shit happened, don't stop. You go home! Let's run man. It's Zé Roberto! Hold it. Come with me man. Follow me. You are over exposing yourself! It will end badly. Hey man, so good to see you. This guy is Ivan. Great guy. Hell of a shooter. He is a Revolutionist. Managed to escape the government forces. The command was reduced to just the two of us. But the fight continues. Did you knew that Izael Gomes was captured? Edgar was shot in a Police station. Remember Jaime? He is enjoying smoking weed in Paris. He turned hippy and plays a little flute all day. He was going to shoot me! Do you think I enjoy killing? Listen, Zé Roberto, do you know who Garcia is? This that your feeling in your stomach is a gun. Hug me, smile to your mates and come with me. - Are you going to kill Me? - I want my brother. Miguel Godoi da Fonseca. - So it's you... - I want my brother dead or alive. You're insane boy. You know that when someone is captured this way he doesn't come back. He's dead. Let it go, boy. There are no more complications with you. - And where is the body? - I can't tell, he'll kill me. Lower your voice! We can kill you too. - Who's he? - Barreto. Sir Barreto. He's also looking for you. It checks out. He's on the list. A cold torturer. See... let me go now. And you, how many have you killed? - Garcia? - Here! - Garcia? - Shut up! Let's go, mate. Here. You are shitty bodyguards. The national team without major issues questions the grass height. Brazil proposes an agreement against terrorism. Two subversive Brazilians arrive to Chile and request political asylum. Guanabara representative is elected Miss Brazil. Roberto and Paulo César are the coach jokers. Brazil and Italy meet today fighting for the World Cup. Look here Marta. Thanks Mariana. Take care of your sister. Don't let her get dirty. I have some money. To live with the children, I can manage... I can also find a job. Marta this money is precisely for people like you. I don't want it. Thank you. Fernanda? Mummy is calling you. She's right Miguel. The best that she can do is leave the country. And you should also go. You know that I won't leave now. Why does it matter who Barreto is? What's the use of killing him? It won't solve anything! The problem is way larger. I don't want you to die. If you leave I'll join you. I fixed fake passports. New names, new life. Come on Miguel. Who knows if the school, the farm, it would work out. Let's go... Zé Roberto thinks the same. He and Ivan. They know that it's impossible here. We need to leave Brazil now. In the future, we can return when the situation has improved. And we could change everything, all of it. Are you all right? What an ugly guy! Marcelo! Fernanda! It's him. - They found us. - I think he spotted me. We have to call the others. I already know. Take the children to the bedroom. We can't leave or they'll escape. You don't want me to wait for backup? Not now. Let's try by ourselves. It's him. - What happened? - Nothing. Everything is all right. I'll stay here. We should protect the back. Calm down. No one shoots. I want a gun. Keep calm. I'll try to dialogue. When you're shooting, aim for the ball sack to hit the head. Those guys don't want to chat. Shoot first and then come bank inside. Sir Barreto? There are children inside. You don't need to shoot. I'll go outside. All right you can come. Hand's up! Let the children and my brother's wife leave. One of the men you killed. What was that? Nothing... stay here for a while. It's better to let the children leave. Stop jabbering. Everybody outside. Let's go, big boy! Cover me and I'll get the gun. Come inside! Zé Roberto! It's OK Mariana. I fought for liberty. I was ambitious. Don't you think that I'm right? They will call for backup. We must leave now. We have to run. I'll take you to the airport. Come with me. Hit the gas. Mariana! Goal! Brazil! Goal! Carlos Alberto! Jersey number 4! The events depicted in this movie are fictitious.
