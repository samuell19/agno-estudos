Excuse me. - Please buy your tickets - I'll sort it out at the back. You want to sort him out at the back? Don't say those inappropriate things. Don't pretend to be a lady, Peter Pan. Let's go. Stop talking nonsense. Big head, no brain. Forget it. Sorry to trouble you, nine people. Let's go, let's go. What are you looking at? Let's go. Only thirty dollars, that's all I have. I only have this, it's okay. Give it to me. Is that OK with you? Don't be like this. Let him be. Take a seat... Really cool. Hey. So handsome. Like a country bumpkin. Good brother. Ah Ying. I told you to call me Dream Poetry. Is Ah Ying a bad name? I don't like it, it's too common. I like it when people call me Dream Poetry. Do you think we're making an art film now? Am I not qualified? Just wait and see, I'll be a star one day. I've already thought of a stage name. It's "The Pillow Sisters". Yes, just this name alone can make us famous. Let me ask you, are you really sisters? Came from the same womb! Great, two young girls. Good quality, can make money. She's a hostess, don't you know? Hostesses are great, amazing. If she likes you, she'll be with you for life. Everyone says that. Do you work in this industry? You're just a hair salon shampoo boy. Don't argue, we can pick up a few of them. When the time comes, we can be their pimps! Have you got your ID card yet? You can mooch off a girl for a while. Ah Ying can work at nights. Peter Pan is still a juvenile, even if she gets caught, she won't be in much trouble. Think about it, we can make a fortune. Where did you buy this ribbon? Do I look like a macho man? Is it handsome? So tacky. I'll show you a magic trick. - Give me the ribbon - Get off! We'll give it back to you later. Look, there's nothing in my hand. It's very mysterious. Watch closely. Pay attention. Don't blink. Change. It's gone. Great trick, really amazing. Awesome! It's too dark here. They're bullying us because we can't see. Show us again. I said it's gone, it isn't there. You really think it's there? Any more ribbons? No, just this one. Don't be so stingy, you're so cheap. Hurry up, hand it over. Open your eyes and look closely this time. Nothing in my hand. Look closely, it changes quickly. Look, it's very clear. Change. It's gone again. What is this? Hey, what are you doing? Ah Sai, wake up. What are you doing? Ah B, isn't that Lawrence? Introduce us. No, introduce yourself. I don't want to overshadow him. Didn't you promise to pay me back just now? Forget it, don't be so stingy. They helped us out on the last issue of Disco. Forget it. Cream, not going to dance? May, let's go. Look at his smug face. Where's my ribbon? What ribbon? Why don't you look for it? Go find it yourself. Will you return it? Why are you holding onto me? Stop it, don't fight. You little brat. Hit him! Kill him! Quick, give it back to me. It's up your ass. I'll count to three. Here. Ah B, the hairdresser, I know him. Every time I get my hair washed, he always asks me for my autograph. These are the editors of Youth Magazine. Ah MAY. We brought them here to interview you. I'm called Peter Pan. Have you seen their magazine? It's selling really well. Our pictures were on the cover. People recognised us on the streets. Do you want a few of my modeling photos? I can give you some to publish. What does dancing mean to you? It's tiring to dance too much? What is your dream? To become famous and earn more money. That's my dream too... Look at that effeminate guy. Thinks he's John Travolta. It's crass to act like that even if you are successful. Big brother. Are you alone? No, my brothers are all downstairs. It must have been stolen. Didn't I tell you not to steal? Did you go to rob someone? No. Never do that. If you're going to do it, you have to make big money. Did you look for a real job? What can I do? I didn't study much. Do you want me to do manual labor? Find a legitimate job. Listen to me, for once. It's for your own good. We can't keep fooling around. How long can it last? Taxi. I'm off, catch you later. What are you doing? Here, put these on. Cream, where did you go? Come on, let's dance! What's so good about dancing? If you want to dance, be a stripper and earn some cash. All you ever think about is dancing. What about tomorrow or the day after? What if dancing goes out of style? We'd be screwed. Not that we aren't now. Let's go, let's go. Why are you walking so fast? Are you crazy? Cream, make these two girls earn money for us. Dream on. Where to? To get Lawrence's autograph. Is his handwriting pretty? I'll sign it for you. Too bad your name isn't worth anything. I could get famous by taking my clothes off. Really? Take them off and let's find out. - I'm not afraid. - If you have the guts, take it all off. - I'm afraid of scaring you guys. - I'm not afraid of you. Old lady race! Wait for me. Let's get out of here. King Kong. King Kong, tell your brother not to make a fuss. King Kong, tell them to shut up. I'm going back first, you two carry on. I'll pick you up tomorrow. May, how many pages are left to paste? There are still a lot, don't mention it. Looks like we'll be working overnight again. Just try to stay positive. It took me all day to finish three pages. And you, hurry up and finish writing that article. We have the whole night, what's the rush? Get working. Good for nothing kids. Where should we go to have some fun? - Let's get some snacks. - Let's go for a swim. Okay, okay. Are you guys planning to have group sex? Watch your language and show some respect. Do you think you're Miss Hong Kong? Let's go to Tsuen Wan, drive faster. Can't hold it in anymore. Come on, let's go... Don't hold us up, be quick about it. Ah B, do you have any money? - Are you kidding me? - Who's kidding? Be quick about it, take out everything you have. Always so distrustful. This is all I have. Enough? - What about King Kong? - He's even worse off than me. What should we do then? That's all we have, we're broke. We spent it all at the disco. We're in trouble now. I want to make it clear, this isn't our business. Yes? Cream, what should we do? Run? Why run? We just won't pay. Friend, fill it up. Also check the engine and fill it up with oil. Are we just going to drive off? - King Kong is in the bathroom. - That's his problem. Cream, what do you think? What do we do? Come over here... What? You want to rob them? What are you doing? Quiet! King Kong is coming out. King Kong, come over here... So stupid. This is our chance. - A fat hog ready for the chop. - What are you doing? You guys are crazy. Why me? Can't Ah Sai go? I'm not doing it. It's always me. Okay, let's decide with rock-paper-scissors. What a beauty. So cool, really stylish. Like a great white shark. Point to the thief, point to who will be the big thief. Wait, let me tie my shoelaces first. Get on with it! Be quick. Are you done showing off? What a pain Come on, let's do it again. Ah Sai, put it at the bottom. Next. Who's the thief? Who's the thief? Okay, you go. That's not right. You can't count from the bottom up. No more excuses. Hurry up and go in... Go in. You go, go. Don't move. Do you want money or your life? Do you want money or your life? What's wrong with you, kidney problems? Why is it taking so long? Maybe he's slacking off in there. They must be playing mahjong. They've already played several rounds. What's going on? Are we going to let them get away? - What are you doing? - What about you? Is this your car? How much is it worth? Loser. What do we do now? There's nothing we can do. Get Ah B. Hold on. That was pathetic. We should have known he couldn't handle it. One, two, three. Hey, want some soda? Over there. There's nothing good. Ninety dollars. Ask my brother for it, the money is with him. I'm here, I won't run away. Let's go. Did you piss yourself? If you're so capable, then you go. That fat guy's legs are thicker than my neck. What about King Kong? Friend. Wait a minute. Mum, I'm not coming back. I'm with my friends. Soup? Keep it for me to drink tomorrow. Don't page me if there's nothing wrong. Friend. What? Your brother asked me to get money from you. What for? For the gas. They're joking. Want to leave? It's not my car. Where are you going? Damn it, you back-stabbers. Pay up! Get lost! If you don't have money, don't try to get others to pay. You guys are really going to ditch me? Drag him inside. Punk, show me your weapon. Third robbery this month. Let's see if you dare to do it again. Beat him up. Go die. Don't move, I have a gun. Go inside. Don't move. Move again and I'll turn your body into a beehive. Be careful, if you pull it again it will tear. Sister, look. It stinks, take it off. What stinks? Don't move, put it down. Hurry up. Turn your head, don't move. Don't move, do you want to die? King Kong... Ah Sai, slow down. Step back, are you itchy? Help him up. Grab the money. Don't move, stand still. Cream. Open it. What are you looking at? Go die... Don't do it... You stinker, go die. What's wrong? Ah Ying, let's go. Cream might be hurt. That's why we need to go now. If you want to go, go by yourself. Ah Ying... let's go. Ah Ying, don't go in, let's go. Ah Ying... let's go. - Come with me. - I won't go in. Let's go. What are you doing? Let go, don't do this. It's pitch black, are you crazy? Let's go? Don't do this. Let go, you're crazy. If you don't let go, I'll hit you. Come and help. Help, Ah B! He's pulling my hair! Get his hands off me. It hurts, let go! It's too tight! Ah Ying, Peter Pan, come help us! Let's go, forget about him... Ah Ying, hurry! Ah Ying, let's go... Let go... let go of my foot. Let go. What are you doing? Come back. Let's go. Come back, you can't leave. - Come back... - Let me go... Ah B, go inside... There's a police car, a police car is coming. Cream. Cream, come in quickly, there's a police car coming. Cream, what should we do? Why are you laughing so much? Remember yesterday when we took the minibus? We happened to pass through Temple Street. There was a group of women dressed up and standing there. A child in the bus asked his mother, "Mum, what are those women doing?" His mother replied, "They're just taking a walk." Who knew the driver would interrupt and say, He said, "There's no need to lie to children. They'll understand sooner or later. Those are hookers.'" The mother was so angry she was fuming. The child continued to ask, "What's a hooker?" Guess what the driver said? "They're women who get paid to sleep with men." The child then asked, "Mum, do hookers have children?" Guess how the mother responded. How did she respond? She said "Of course!" "When their kid grows up, they become minibus drivers." I need to go to the bathroom first. Officer, working late? Officer, just started your shift? Officer, need your engine checking? Whose car is this? A customer's. This kind of car is very dangerous. A fire hazard. The license has expired, they won't renew it. Really? Been drinking? Where's the driver? Officer, let me get your gas. Fill it up? Officer. Officer, I understand. Are you new here? You don't know what a police car is? What is this red stain? Your clothes don't look like they fit you. What's that? Your heart is beating so fast, what have you done? Who's inside? No one, just my friends. No one? Don't move, show me inside. Want some soda, officer? Quit it, let's go. Don't make a noise, you stay here. It's so dirty, how did you stir it? Sorry, officer, let me clean it for you. Sorry, officer. What's wrong? Nothing, just got his boots dirty. Sorry, officer. It's okay, it's no big deal. Let me clean it for you. It's okay, forget it, don't clean it. Sorry, officer. Sorry, officer. Sorry for the trouble, officer. Let's go. Good omen, fortune is coming. Sorry, officer, take care. Twenty-six rooms searched in the villa, A crime scene, calling for backup. Should have closed earlier. The streets and alleys are like Wudang. She held onto me and wouldn't let go. Why is no one answering? Do it yourself, I need the bathroom. I'll go with you. I'm dying, I've needed a piss for hours. Did your mother teach you to say "piss"? So vulgar. My Mum taught me to say "pee-pee". What are you doing? Look carefully. This one is yours, that one is mine. Good thing you looked. Stop, stop. Something's not quite right. What do you mean? Why would someone be painting at this time of night? Forget it. He cleaned your shoes, right? Let's go back and take a look. What's up? What's happening? Go! What is that? Be careful, don't hit it! Number 55, come on! King Kong, King Kong. What do we do now? Do you have any ideas? What do you mean by that? Are you saying we will betray you? Hold on, I didn't say that. If you don't want us to report you... The money in the safe belongs to me and Ah Ying. What? We didn't kill anyone, think about it. Women are nothing but trouble, like I always said. Can you take us home first? Where are you guys going? King Kong, King Kong. Cream, it's serious. What's the matter? He's bleeding non-stop. - Let me take a look. - How is he? - Should we send him to the hospital? - Let me see. Are you crazy? They'll call the police. King Kong. Watch out! Go to hell... Go to hell. What should we do? Help him down first. Is this enough? It's enough, too much. Ah Ying. King Kong, what's wrong with you? Get lost, you bunch of bastards. Did you pay for the gas? King Kong, you're hurt. I wonder why? Get lost. I can walk by myself. Ah B. Go to sleep already, why are you still making a noise? I have to go out. It's so late and you still want to go out? Go to sleep first, I still have something to do. You always sleep so late, no wonder you're so skinny. Don't do that, we'll wake up the children. They're all asleep. Come on. Ah Ying, help me out. Hurry up. Ah Ying, give me a hand. Ah Ying, help me move the safe. Who's that? What are you doing in my car? Ah Sai, come help, hurry up... What are you doing in my car? Thief! Thief! Some delinquents are stealing cars. Get in the car. Want to run? You delinquents. Get in quickly, let's drive. Hurry up and drive. Why is it taking so long? Don't grab my hand. Hurry up and drive... Come out. Just go, drive! What are they doing down there? Ignore him, Cream. Just drive! Cream, don't. Why are we going this way? There's a police station over there. How do we get back then? We can't go back now. Got it? Why are you so aggressive? What's the big deal? Stealing a car, driving without a license, rob, kill... ... running over an old man, you'll be in jail for life. You have a problem with what I'm saying? You want to fight? Am I wrong? You don't like it? - Say it again if you dare. - You want to fight? Let's fight. What do you mean? Afraid of me? Ah Ying, what's going on? No, Cream, what are you doing? Get out of the car, both of you. Who are you to tell us to leave? We're not leaving. I'm sick of carrying that stupid safe and sick of you. Get out of the car, get out... What's your problem? Ah Ying, Ah Ying. Just go away. Cream, let it go. Please give the phone to Ah Wing. Who is this? Big Brother, it's Cream. Big Brother, we're in trouble. What happened? We killed someone. What? Who? How did it happen? An attendant at the gas station. We were fooling around and a fight broke out. I fought back and he died. Big Brother, I want to come to you now. How could you be so reckless? What about the others? Ah B ran away, King Kong got hurt. Big Brother, this time we really need your help... You guys should lay low for a while. Wait until things calm down before making any plans. We'll think of something. Where should we go? Let's go to your place first. Come here? Ah Wing, are you okay? Okay. Okay, wait for us. I'm coming. Cream. Ah Lo, pour the tea. Are you done yet? Coming. Ah B. Big Brother. - How did this happen? - What happened to the others? I told them to hide and not show their faces. I didn't mean to run away, Big Brother. I was scared to death at the time. What do you want to do now? I want to sneak back to the mainland tomorrow morning. Okay, when things calm down, you can come back and find me. This world is still yours. But if things go wrong, don't mention my name. Why? I'm not afraid of you dragging me down, but it might lead the cops to the others. Oh, okay. Remember. Okay. Do you have any money? Just a little bit. Take it for now. Thank you, Big Brother. How much is there? Three hundred dollars. Let's take a look. What do you want, kid? How much to spend the night with me? Don't get the wrong idea, I don't have any girls, just me. I'm asking you how much. You, I'll give you a discount of 20%. So how much do you want? How much do you have? Fifty dollars should be enough. Let's go... Give it all to me. Are you kidding me? This is robbery. I'm taking a risk here, I could get arrested. - Give it back - Can you get it back? - What are you doing? - Let go, give it back. - You brat, let go or not? - No. Give it back, let go... Are you letting go or not? Rape! Rape! Get lost, go away. - What's going on? - He went that way. Chase. Don't run! Don't run! Don't run! You can't run away! Help! Help! Save me! I'm falling! Hold on, pull him up! Hold on to me... don't let go, hold on to me... Hold on tighter. No, hold on tighter. Use your handcuffs. Can't you hear me? Now for a news flash. - Brother, be careful. - Tonight at around 12:30am, - Keep your mouth shut. - Six men and women aged 16 to 20, Robbed the gas station with guns. The two employees of the gas station resisted fiercely. One of them was stabbed in the throat by the robbers and died on the spot. The other was severely beaten. After the robbery, the robbers escaped by car... Keep quiet What happened? How's your big brother? What happened? What happened? How's your big brother? He betrayed us. He really betrayed us? What do we do now? There's nothing we can do, get in the car. What big brother? What? Get lost. Undercover police. Why so much blood? Did you get into a fight? No, it's just a joke with some friends. Quiet down. Give us a chance, officer. Don't move. What are you guys doing? Where did the safe come from? Officer, it was him. He did everything. It's not my fault, he's the one who killed... Shut up, shut up! Don't make a sound. Don't move, don't move. Officer, help, help! Let me go! Don't speak. Want to run? Still running? Don't! You want to run? Don't run! Help! Still running! Peter Pan, are you crazy? No, you're crazy! Betray us? Let's go, Cream. There's another hole in my ass! King Kong. Are we staying here tonight? What? Yeah. Is there a phone here? What for? I want to tell my Mum I won't be home for soup. Okay, I'll do it for you. I thought you guys betrayed me. Cream, there's water. There's a tap over there. King Kong's awake. Forget him, why bother with him? We're almost there. Great, it's open. - Open it... - Let me do it... What's wrong? Are you scared? My hands are shaking, let me open it. We're gonna hit the jackpot this time! Big money, let's go! What is this crap? Lousy safe, piece of shit. Stupid safe. Her brain's fried. Get lost, it's all because of you. You're a bunch of lowlifes, dragging us down. What? Say that again. I will! Following you won't lead to anything good. Listen, you won't have a good ending if you don't follow us either. Cream, watch your mouth. What, you got a problem? Do you think you're a lady? Next time, try acting like a lady. Alright, Cream, don't push me. What, are you afraid of me now? Are you angry? Do you want to go nuts? Bastard! Sister. Stop fighting. Stop it, you guys. Stop fighting. Stop it... don't fight... Don't fight... You ruthless bitch. I'll strangle you... you bitch, die... Let's go. Die... You bitch, I'll strangle you. Sister. King Kong... King Kong, wake up. Bright streetlights in the fog. Long night, cold and desolate. Firelight ahead illuminates. Chased by shadows from behind. Night car races nowhere. There must be a way up ahead. Who is willing to speak their mind? We are all scared. May the light inside our hearts shine through. Sing together in the wind. That star in the sky. Shining in the distance, I want to run towards it. But I am powerless. That day will come, I can finally find my way. We're here. Get out. Why aren't you going? Leaving us after you've had your fun? What about the breakup fee? We're just a bunch of single guys wandering around, we treat the world as our home, we know many women, but I've never heard of a breakup fee. Why are you talking so much? Drive. Think it over. Stop talking, are you going to drive or not? Alright... thank you. We've recorded everything you just said as testimony. You can go now. We'll be in touch if there's any news. Chief, we've caught a thief. Wait a moment, that's all. It wasn't my fault! I didn't do it! Let go! Hurry, hurry! Don't move. It's not my fault... I didn't do it... Cream killed him, it's not my fault. Ah Sai, King Kong killed him. Cream used a knife to kill him, it's not my business. I didn't take any money, it was them... Ah Sai, King Kong... Are you crazy? What do you mean, crazy? They killed someone... I can't do it. Do you really think he will lend it to us? Aren't we waiting for him to come back? No wonder no one reads this magazine. There's no fashion, no love letters, not even horoscopes. And they call it a magazine for youth. Do they even know what's going on? What happened to Ah B? Cream, I want to wash my face. What? I... I want to wash my face. Go ahead. Don't mess with us. Search everywhere. You said Cream was here. He lives here, officer. Then why can't we find him? How would I know? Cream, is everything okay at home? Cream. Don't run around. Mum, do I still need to go to school today? What did my brother do? Officer. Have you thought about the future? I have no idea. I really don't know what to say. It's Ah B, Are Cream and the others there? Ah B. Ask him where he is first. Tell him he's dead if he betrays us. Where are you? Mr. Leung? Listen carefully. We are the Hong Kong Royal Police. I am an undercover police officer from Kowloon Headquarters. Belonging to the Homicide Division, code name DC.666. Stop talking and answer me. I want to know if Cream, King Kong, and Ah Sai have come to see you. What did you say? Say it again. Don't think I'm afraid to shoot. Did you hear me? Can you hear me? One by one, one by one. One, two, three. Three, two, one. Two, three, four. Four, three, two. Did you hear me? Did you hear me? Call again. Wait. Is this Youth Magazine? Cream, help me... Don't shoot. Let go, let go. Are you crazy? You lunatic. It was crawling up my leg, how can I not be afraid? What did Ah B say? He said he's coming and to wait for him to leave together. Did he say where he is now? You guys were yelling like pigs, I could barely hear him. Why are we waiting? That punk could call the cops on us and turn us in. No he wouldn't do that. We should wait for him, right? How do you know he wasn't caught by the police? With a gun pointed at him, he would say anything. Cream. If it were you... he'd wait. Oh yeah, didn't you say you were waiting for Ah Tim to come and take you to the house in the New Territories? Isn't he almost here, Ah May? Don't be smart. Kowloon Homicide Division paging station. Address is 15A Wu Ham Street. Repeat, Kowloon Homicide Division paging station. Address is 15A Wu Ham Street. As soon as I see him, I'll kill him. Give me the gun. Let go. Let go, let go... isn't it too late? You killed people, do you want to kill more? It wasn't our fault, they beat up King Kong first. Don't always blame us. Am I blaming you? I'm just stating a fact. What did he say? He told you to think carefully about what you want to do. Reading my horoscope? Sounds like a social worker. I hate social workers the most. They persecute people for the government. Do you know what the government is? Have you seen a social worker? No, but I bet they're like him. You should be ashamed. Don't read books, don't work, worse than street dogs. Aren't we working now? Moving and carrying things around all day, We've been labouring all day long. One day of labour is better than ten days of your work. Right, what's the point of studying? My older brother graduated, he's just an errand boy now. Only 500 dollars a month, doesn't even cover his bills. What's the use of studying if you have natural talents? I can earn $200 just by letting someone touch my body. But I look after my body, otherwise, I could earn more. Right? Underestimating us? Ah Ying, let's go back and work hard, Make 3,000 dollars a month and treat ourselves to some cold noodles. Why hasn't he come yet. 15A Hunan Street, this is it. It should be correct. Is it Hunan Street or Wu Ham Street? I clearly heard it was Wu Ham Street. How can there be a 15A on Wu Ham Street? It's a dead end alley. Let's go back, it's a dead end. Stupid brat, he said it was Wu Ham Street again. Stinky kid, he said it was Wu Ham Street again. It's what he said, not my fault. Help! Robbery! Quiet, we're the police. - Why would the police arrest me? - Don't go in there. Police! It's not my business, not my fault. Help! Someone save me! Someone save me! Ah Lee! Are the hostages okay? What hostages? Slow down, is there anyone upstairs? Captain, wait. Really, no one? Is it them? Didn't they say there were three editors? Please help, he's passed out. Oh, please sit down first. - Where should we put him? - Right here. Don't be nervous. My name is Wong. - What's your name? - My surname is Leung. Leung what? - Leung Fan - Leung Fan? Are you deliberately teasing me, Leung Fan? He's making fun of me. - It's L-e-u-n-g F-a-n, Jellyfish noodles? Struggling Fan? What about you? Your name isn't Liangcha, is it? Leung Fan? Liangcha? My surname is Guo. - Are you the editors of Youth Magazine? - It sells pretty well. Something's not right, do artificial respiration. I can't, I have a beard. Ah Ming, do artificial respiration. Isn't that like kissing? Mum said I shouldn't. Got it, there's a way. Open his mouth wider. You're Guo Anna, he's Leung Fan. Hold on tight, we'll pull you up. My shoe! Don't let it fall and hit the cops. Take it slow, slow down. What's up? - Why was it so noisy on the phone? - The chair fell over. The chair fell over? Go in, quickly. Look at her shoes, take them off first. Send some people up the stairs. It's too crowded, get out. Why is it so noisy? Cream. What's going on out there? Mum, don't interfere. Go inside and read the newspaper. What's going on? Where's everyone going? It's the police. Let's go see. - The elevator is broken now. - What happened? I told you not to let so many people in. The suspects have climbed up to the rooftop of the building. Send men up and surround them. Let's go. Okay. Why are there so many people? Don't look, Mum, let's go back. Cream, use your gun... Are you guys filming a movie? Any big stars in it? Mother, are you OK? Hurry up. There's nowhere to go, what do we do? What do we do, what do we do? Cream, it's locked. Get down. Listen up, you're surrounded. Put down your weapons and surrender. Cream, Cream. Get out of here. Go to hell. Peter Pan. Peter Pan... Ah Ying. Did you hear me? This is your final warning. Put down your weapons and surrender. Ah Sai. Ah Sai... Go to hell... Ah Ying, Ah Ying. No, no... Bright streetlights in the mist Long night, cold and desolate Ahead, a fire illuminates Chased by shadows from behind Night car speeding towards nowhere There must be a way ahead Who is willing to speak their mind? Both of us are also frightened Wishing to reveal the light inside our hearts Singing together in the wind That star in the sky Shining in the distance, I want to run towards it Regretfully, I have no strength to climb up On this day Lost and directionless The night car races towards the unknown There must be a way ahead Gazing at the wild fire, creating illusions
