"He's giving us a long face as we ask for raising our salaries." "You're really dreaming." "That's the way it is, we have to work the hell out." "That's the way it is, it's something just won't happen." "That's the way it is." "Dare you rob or not!" "Don't expect to get in full" "for what you did." "lt's now hard to make a living."

What's your name? l'm Akiho Yoshizawa. Nice to meet you, and yours? l'm Yoshino Taro. Mr. Yoshino! Yes. You like MJ? MJ? No. But l just saw you do the Moonwalk with them. No, l stepped on the faeces! Faeces? Yeah, l just felt that l stepped on something, then l took a look. lt's faeces! Then l was trying hard to rub it off... Then l took a look again. My right foot had stepped on the faeces too. Then l tried to shake it off. Did you shake it off? l did. Thanks. Thank you. l gotta go. Bye. Miss, you're back. - Dad, l'm back! - Honey! You're back?

He never did a single right thing. l'm eating in my room, save some soup for me. Honey, l don't understand. Why do you have to be like that every time? l don't understand either. . . why do we have fries, wieners, luncheon meat for dinner. . . ls this a fast food? Why do we have to do that for him? Just eat out! You have to pay after selling Hong, you bastards get the hell out of here. What would l do? Don't be afraid, we'll protect you! Hello, everybody! Honey. . .

Thank you, l knew that you guys could protect me. Right, how should l repay you? Marry me. Marry me! Marry me. Bro Kin... Come... Bro Kin... You never pay attention to me when you come. You always rush into the washroom, what are you doing? lt's nothing. The soup is ready. Really? Bring me a bowl! Who would drink in the washroom? Smells good, what is it? Chicken feet with peanuts. Great! You have some too, you need that. You're making fun of me. Don't you like it? Thanks. Hong, you look bothered. Bro Kin, actually l don't want to tell you. lt's okay, go ahead! l'm gonna tell you then. l'll be gone soon. What? What's wrong with you? That's not what l meant! l'm going back to my hometown soon! l already got a job there. Your hometown? What kind of job you have? l'll be a principal. You have your own school? l have been sending money to them every month to set up a primary school. lt's almost done now, so l'll be the principal. That's really amazing. l just hope that they could learn more Mathematics. l don't want them to be like me! l used to be dragged on for my debt. Come visit me if you have time. How could l? lt's so embarrassing! How do l explain? l'm her client, huh? You're the director though. You know what? There are 2 classrooms, a sports ground, it's all on you. - You didn't know - l would have such achievement. l remember when l started selling mobile phones, My master told me that you have to win regardless of how many people die. ln order to deal with the opposite store, we have to introduce promotion. lt's "Mobile Massage" l've been explaining and demonstrating the whole orning, do you guys understand? We do. Bon voyage. Let's work on it. $30 for a month, lDD all you can dial. Madam! Would you like to check out our new mobile phone? Do l need to buy it here? l'd better buy it in Shenzhen.

Thanks, l'll get the things ready. Boss! Looking for mobile phones? Do you have thunder display for your phones? You've come to the right place. Caller display has been developed for more than ten years. All of our phones here have caller display. This is our newest mobile phone. lts cover is made from deodorant-metal, with ultimate 3D vision... Listen, l said thunder display. . . Like this one, it shows when there will be a storm... when it's gonna rain or thunder. This one then, you can use it to call the observatory. You can check whatever you want. Back to this phone, it has MP3,... Thanks. Boss. Your phone is ringing and flashing, what's up? lt tells me it's gonna rain soon. You speak Mandarin. Right. Actually, l know it's gonna rain soon.

Wait, you have something in your mouth? No, this is how it is when you speak Mandarin. Yeah? Yes, Hong Kong welcomes you. Bye. lnteresting. Boss. Boss, good news from Tokyo. We took over the major spot for mobile phones in Tokyo, Shinjuku. Sai Yeung Choi street. . . would be the last one in our plan. Make it quick, go for it! Uncensored porn movies, good stuff for you guys. Hey man, it's good watching porn movies more often. . . Raise rent again? For how much? Triple! When? Now? There will be interest for late payment, what the hell? We have to discuss this together. Let's hold a meeting! Why did you change your voice? So as to go with the mood. Everybody, we've been running our businesses here for so many years. The landlord raises the rent every year. At the time of the financial tsunami, he's raising the rent triply. That's really too much. He's sucking out our blood. We need to stand out to be against the increase of rent! Against the increase of rent!... l agree! Chun, you don't have to go so far... for smashing your own head. lt's paint, if l didn't borrow money from the loan-shark, how could l pay the rent? l was late for two days, they splashed me with paint. l told them not to splash on my store. lf they did, how could l keep my business running? He said, "okay", then he splashed me on the head. How could l afford such an expensive rent for my book store? l started off on the ground floor, then moved to 2/F, and from 2/F to 8/F. l'm gonna have to move to the roof soon, l'm gonna die. My comic store won't last too long. Astro, really? You have foot massage and Lolita at your store, it's so crowded. But l can't stand that anymore. Cosplaying all the time. Not long ago, "Death Note" was so popular, l had to put on make-up to be the Death. l got a skin allergy from that. The worse is "Fullmetal Alchemist" The armor is damn heavy, how could my back stand that? l'm no better! Such a small unit, with a rent over $300,000. l have to sell thousands of sport shoes to cover the rent. lmagine, l have to serve thousands of customers and smell their stinky feet. Now l can't smell anything at all. l have to sell several tens of thousand of fish-balls to cover the rent. That means. . . l have to make a few hundreds of thousand of fish-balls! Just imagine. What's the big deal? We're the worst for selling porn movies! We stay up from day till night. l have to deliver leaflets, filling up the rack, taking care of the cashier and do the promotion. And l'd be the one taken away by the customs. l'm so pathetic. . . Come on, your rent is the cheapest one! BT downloading sucks, it gives no respect to copyright. Everybody is downloading porn movies through BT! There'd be no room for us. We're talking about opposing the raise in rent! Just sit down! Against the raise in rent! Feeling thirsty? Have one, my treat! What's this? lced lemon soya drink. What? lced lemon soya drink. lced lemon soya drink? Will l get diarrhea from this? Everything comes out eventually. Lemon is served with everything now. l'll have 24 herbs with lemon, herbal jelly with lemon, everything will have lemon in it. Business should go with the trend. Okay, l got it. Just like "Milan Station". You trade in your used bag and get a new one, what a bargain! We'll do the same. Porno, you'll let your customers exchange their old movies with new ones... along with our "Ultimate phone" coupon. Fishy, you'll do it the same way, as long as it's alive, it goes along with our... "Ultimate phone" coupon, ok? Used shoes are stinky and worn out, no one would buy that. Just wash it beforehand. l gave all the used shoes to Kin, he likes to wear my used shoes. Luckily l know kung-fu. l'm talking about our welfare, - Our welfare? - but you're talking about personal resentment. Our welfare is just giving out your own coupons? l'm trying to help each other out, ain't l? Come on, it's just helping you though. What do you think then? Your store sucks, it's pulling down the average. What are you talking about? Do you think it's the HKCEE? Did you take that? You didn't complete your primary school, say "try my best". Grab your breast! lt's try your best! l grab your breast! lt's try your best! You try and grab Chun's breast then? Come on! You dare not! Do you have the guts? You don't know English! And you're so rough! You're not educated! lt's just a waste talking to you! Excuse me, who's Mr. Chan Bai Xiang? l am, who are you? You haven't paid your rent for 3 months, here's a warrant from the court. We have to seal up your store. Please leave the store immediately. Bro Nat! You're bluffing the hell out but you haven't paid your rent for 3 months? You know. How much l earn and l have to pay that all to him. lt's much worse than working for him. So l stopped paying him the rent and l put the money towards investment. l do have money, l can pay him anytime. You think he'll seal up my store? Do you have a friend called Pang? Yes! We played in the same band since we were young. l taught him to leave home and that changed his whole life. We've checked with the bank. You guys bought "accumulator" for a few tens of millions and it's all gone now! Even if you sell out all your assets, you still owe the bank 60 million. Pang left with OK already, you'd better... claim for bankruptcy. l've been hanging out here for so many years, and now it's gone, l will have nowhere to go. lt's closing down, what a pity! Wait, l need to get my stuff back. Sorry, Mr. Chan. Everything here is no longer under your possession. lt's nothing valuable, but it means so much to me. l see nothing. Thanks. Knocking off. Bro Nat's face seems purplish, he's got 7 moles on his foot. . . He wears a Buddha bracelet on his left hand and holds a lighter in his right. He's born to be a king. He's born to have a good life but his restaurant still has to close down. What should we do then? Check this out, it's just in today. The one you're looking at. . . is our best seller. Returning the battery? l'm afraid you're too nervous. ls this your store? l run it with my friends, let me introduce them to you. Certified. They're experts in assembling mobile phones in Mongkok. They're working on it, don't interrupt them. Monitor. Speaker. Wipe the sweat. Wipe my sweat Okay... Done. l-phone lu cover, Nokiano system, LG lu keyboard, and... Sony Ericsson's lens. Okay. Lucky, go ahead! Got it! Awesome? Awesome. Who is this? My friend, Yoshizawa... l'm Jade. Jade Yoshizawa, wonderful. lt's just an eye wide shot for me. You guys are really experts. Jade! Witch? Haven't seen you for years, you're still the same. Keeping in good shape. Not like you, you used to be so fat. This one is okay. . . Yeah. She's much more beautiful than Akiho Yoshizawa. . . ls she more experienced than Akiho? First impression was bad, l stepped on faeces. lt's hard to turn back. That's hard, women don't like shitty stuff. Yeah. Then you have to think of a wonderful idea now. So as to make her hold your hands. What idea is that? Okay! Go and ask her, can l hold your hands? Okay. Go ahead! Excuse me, there's something l'd like to. . . How could you guys be such good friends? Your father, Kin, and your father, Kung, are feudists. How could you guys be good friends? Your father, Kin, and your father, Kung are... feudists. Kin and Kung are feudists! Your father. . . Kin and Kung... They shouldn't be coming after us. What kind of place is this? What do you think about this place? Okay. lt's been so many years. Yeah, l can't recognize you. You used to be so short. lt was years ago. Just like your brother, he's still the same. Yeah. lt's really weird. Your father and my father have been feudists for years. But they seem to be so close. Of course. Friends and feudists, it's hard to tell sometimes. Do you think they will be friends again one day? lf they knew we were having a private talk here, will they lock us up the next morning? You nuts! You do have an interesting mind. No wonder your store is so weird. But... lt's okay though. Not really, it's far from what l expected. Come here, let me show you something. This would be my dream street. After the reconstruction, Mongkok will be the most flourishing, advanced shopping paradise. lt'll be much better than Tokyo! Are you a fan of Sora Aoi? That's good. You know Sora Aoi? Of course, l've been in AV filming in Japan. Which one though? Couple of hundreds! What? l'm the assistant director. l've been so curious why the AV culture... has such a big influence in Japan. Once l graduated, l joined the AV production. At first l just wanted to have fun. Then l found out how professional they are. We should learn from them. l do have a dream! My dream. . . is to produce a local gospel AV. Gospel AV? What is it? l hope those who have watched my gospel AV won't watch AV anymore. l'll be the script writer and the director, but not necessarily be the actor. But. . .gospel and AV, it's hard to link them up. Someone threw out acids Bastard! Sorry! The place we're standing is the spot where the acids were thrown. We're lucky to be in this spot. lt was late in the night when the incident happened. No one was passing by, otherwise it'd be a tragedy. Mr. Law, what do you think about this incident? l suggested long ago in installing the CCTV. But the government. . . has been dragging it on. lf no one reported this, then no one would have known. Of course l worried about this, my face could have been disfigured by this. Luckily no one got hurt this time, might not be as lucky next time. l really need to raise my complaint! Pearl bubble tea got no pearl, curry fish ball got no taste of curry... dirty noodle is not dirty enough, how could l eat that? The police department will try every means to get the suspect. Bro Kin... We'll get the job done! Bro Kin... - Boss... - Dad... What are they doing? Are you okay? Still playing this at this age? Why do you think you can do that? Why can't l? l turned yourself from a scum into a man. Now l'm just turning you back into a scum, why not? That's enough for you guys. We even saw you guys on TV last night, isn't that enough? lt's all because of you, you keep saying that you want to see your son more often. He's now here for you until you get fed up, okay? He's your son, not your voodoo doll. l don't care how you're messing with Kin. Please don't drag your son in. l just won't let him hang out with them. Not even a glance, that's it. lt's been so many years, is there gonna be an end? Son, is your interceptor done? l'm sure there would be no reception here. What about the lnternet? Once it's on, it will explode automatically. All our stuff will be blown though, punk! The lSP will be blown off instead. Daughter. We have a couple of TV sets, you don't even need to switch channels. And we got 3 computers too. For those Japanese magazines, it'll soon be delivered to you by air. Your brother will fetch you meals everyday. There are different cuisines for you to choose from. There will also be Palestinian cuisine on Sunday. lf you need to buy anything, just yell. Your brother will deliver it within 3 minutes, anyway. . . don't even think about seeing that bastard again. - Dad. - What? Just lock me up then. Honey, be generous. Everyone here knows that l'm the most generous, he's the one being petty. You know what? He's been trying to break us up for years. But he's in vain because we love each other so much. Well, he's now trying to let his daughter seduce our son, and when you went to the store, he kept staring at you and he's trying to rape you visually. You think l don't know that? From now on, when you see him, just walk the other way out. He's a moron, don't know what he's gonna do. You are nuts! l'm not cooking tonight! l'm just telling you the truth, you think l'm nuts? Madam Ha, you're not cooking tonight? You're so nosy! Wonton noodle with veggie, no green onions. lt'd be two orders. Who's so picky about this? What's the big deal bumping into old lovers? Whatever, just pretend you don't know each other. Pretty, that's my tea. Thanks. Thanks... Stretch your leg under the table and see what you get. Don't you get it? Are you dumb? l better come over to teach you. lnsane...Problematic... Bro Kin, what a coincidence? Having noodles? lt's rare for you two sitting together, but one with fluffy hair and looks so miserable, while the other one looks so pale and seems to have not eaten for days. What a perfect match. Madam Ha, you got beaten up? My eyes are sore... l'm not eating anyway, l gotta go. Hong, well done. That's good, Hong! Bro Kin, why are you here? You have friends here? No. Why are you packing up? l'm leaving tomorrow. You've come at the right time. Then l can say goodbye to you in person. Hong, l'll miss your soup. Now, l should tell you the truth. l never made any soup at all. You bought it? lt's by Madam Ha. Hong? l'm gonna tell you the truth. On that day, Madam Ha found out that you came here to my place. l couldn't possibly not tell her. Then l told her that he's kind of weird. He only came to chat with me. He would even eat here to chat a bit more. After she heard that, she brought soup here the next day. She said it's your favorite soup. She told me not to tell you about this. And you came here more often once you drank the soup. She loves making soup and you love to drink. So l didn't tell you. Stop that, l gotta go to the washroom. Hong. Bro Kin. l've been loving you for so many years, don't you know that? l know that. l know that too. Besides loving her, l can also take care of her... forever and ever! What do you mean? l can bring her happiness for a lifetime. Both of you saved me, you two are nice guys. Let us help you choose. We are good buddies and we can share anything except Hong. Same rule. Ready! Right here. Go ahead! Stop fighting! We're not fighting, we're competing for pee in distance... in time. . . in darkness. . . Best of three. How can you do that. . . to me? Take back. Let's do it by coin tossing! Heads l win, tail you win. Bastard, you're using a fake coin. Good that l also have one! Tail! l'm destined... to take care of Hong. Bro Kin. You're good! Of course l'm good. l'll remember you. l'll love her for the rest of her life! Bye! Bro Kin, mopping the floor as usual? For the last time. You need not dress up again. Hong. lt's been tough for you for so many years. Bro Kin... This is the letter of appointment for you to be the director of my school. Thanks. Take care. Granny! How could you do that... to granny? Granny, are you okay? Have you paid protection fee yet? No. No? How can my buddies protect you then? Go ahead! Yes! No!... What are you doing? No! Bastards! l tried so hard to step on it. Don't pull it back! Give it back to me! What are you doing? Stop that! Who's talking? l told you to stop! lt's you. You have to call my name though. l'm Bro Laughing, G, O, R, okay? Do it again. Okay. Come on. . . Beat him up! Help!... Stop that! One more? l want ten. Ten? l only have eight. . .whatever! What are you doing? Fight! Who are you? l'm just a Chinese. Who's your master? lp man? No, it's Donnie Yen. Bullshit, run! l said run, not crawl. Are you okay? l'm okay. l was just playing dead. Why are you so nosy? Shorty, you cried for help, so l made my move. Don't you have any ideas of your own? Will you kill yourself if l told you so? You shorty! Granny, let me help you collect those cardboards. No, l have my own sky eye. Madam Garbage, there're some cardboards at NO. 270. Roger, l got it. Punk, you got a great collection, check this out. Why do you peep at my bro's stuff? No, l just want to take a look at his so called paradise. What kind of person he is? He's got a big collection of these kinds of photos Your bro is really something. Stop pretending. Mongkok Paradise, here it is. What the hell is this? No, my bro's project is a great one. What? Going to Mongkok means going to heaven, that's inauspicious. And... Why are there so many people around with bouquets? lt's the grand opening of a new shop near the MTR's exit, they're selling mobile phones. Selling mobile phones? He's copying my bro's idea. Today l could have my own shop, there's a person l have to thank, he's my father! My son! l'm so proud of you! So proud of you. Shorty! l shouldn't have saved you. Why did you copy my bro's idea? What do you mean? We all sell mobile phones. You can't say The Departed... copied lnfernal Affairs. Wrong! That's a remake, you have to pay the copyright. What the hell is wrong with you two? My bro has been treating you guys so well, why do you betray him? Your father doesn't support your bro though. We are just helping him to fulfill his dream. Right, Taro is so creative. . . But the 4 great inventions were not developed by foreigners. Right. Now we work for this foreigner, no one would criticize about this. Right? Touching. . . Yes. Good! l do want this project to be fulfilled, So l will let Kin take care of the design. With his vision, he'd appreciate this. Not like you! You bastard! l helped you to pay the MPF, allowance, and you... You're less than human. Yes, l am. But l'm good. So l could choose where to live. Are you done? Take them away, l'm holding the scissors. Cut the ribbon or them? Please go back. The neighbors are here, go! . . . Find someone to burn up his store Hong Kong people like to be outstanding. Kid, l know you are mad at me. Well, l used to be the one talking, not you. l admit! About your Paradise Project, l didn't read it seriously. The CG that you made, as l entered it, it's turning upside down, it's so fussy. And the color is too rich, l just don't get it. lt's different this time, they made a real store now. Everything would be seen so clearly. You are really talented. Come on. lf you want to praise your son, you'd better tell him directly. How could you two talk over the door? No one is getting the door? Son, where's the maid? She's preparing the meal. There are so many dishes, it'd take at least an hour. Why is the door unlocked? Where's my daughter? She's jumping off the building. . . Dad! Sis fell! Daughter! . . . Dad! lt's over. . .over there. . . Go, let's talk about it when we come back! What do you mean? You sealed up the door. Right! How? Bastard, being so risky for getting out. You go out and look for him, see how he's doing? Daughter. . . Son, why does she look like that? Looks like a maid? No, she's the maid. Miss told me to do so. Sir, l'm sorry. Can l spare you some time to do a questionnaire? Miss, can l have a minute? l'm busy. ls your mother a male or a female? What about you? Miss, as you're in such a hurry, you must be rushing to find your man. ln fact you don't have to. You're the main actress, if you observe closely, the main actor would be the wandering soul right in front of you, that's me. ls your brother a boy or a girl? What do you think? lnsane! Sir... Before you find out how match we are, our parents are man and woman. We are doing this show in such unison. The script is not important, it's your. . . body Body your hell. . . Trying to fool around! Get lost! Someone threw out acids again. Jade, how are you doing? Jade! - Where did you get hurt? Let me check... - lt hurts... Please call the police and the ambulance! Honey? Are you alright? Still painful? l told you not to go out! lt turned out to be a big mess. Don't be mad at dad, dad is trying to be good to you. Smile, you used to smile a lot when you were young. lf you really want to see that bastard, l'll get him to see you. . . Excuse me, the doctor is waiting for you inside. Have a rest. Dare you come, bastard? To see your daughter. . . Should l call the police and accuse you of kidnapping a minor? Dad, sis has grown up long ago. Accuse you of kidnapping a grown up girl. Get lost, or l will let my dog bite you. Bastard! Why are you following? To see how she's doing. That bastard is here. You stay at the door and let no one go inside, go! Doctor, are you okay? lt's okay. . . ls my daughter alright? She's fine. l checked her retina already and it's fine. Why does she keep saying that she can't see anything? This is "Trauma Sequel" Once she calms down, she will regain her vision. Maybe, should l refer her to a psychiatrist? No, can we do anything for her? Support! Encouragement! Thanks, doctor. Thanks... Doctor, are you okay? lnsane! What's up? Sis seems to listen to what he says more than us. Just check it out. Don't be afraid, the doctor said you'd be fine. Once the bandages are taken off, you'll be fine. What if l still can't see anything? lf l can't see, l'll have nothing. At least you have me. l know that you've been dreaming to become a director. lf you can't see, you will lose all your hope. l'll be your eyes from now on. l'll help you do the casting. l'll help you check the monitor. l'll watch over as you litter. l'll wipe for you after you eat. l'll help you take good care of our child. l'll never let go of his hands. l'll never let go. Being together l can see! l can see you... "Passing through cheer and laughter, live and death." "Being together, through generations and generations." "l will never leave you, you are my eternal love." Dad. Stop imitating Jacky Cheung, you don't sing like him. Who said that? Everyone says l sing like him. Just like playing the disc! Because you're really playing the disc! The real Jacky Cheung is like... "Being together, until the end of the world." "l will never leave you," "you are my eternal love." lt's really alike! You are better than him! Tell him if you ever see him. Son... Thanks... Raising the rent, throwing out acids, that sucks. And we have to eat such bitter stuff? My herbal jelly doesn't taste bitter. Alright. . . Boss, it's not bitter. . . lt's for free, of course it's not, right? Yeah... This psycho. . . is throwing a bigger one every single time. What'd we do? Do you think it's that easy taking such a big one up to the roof? Who would it be? Who cares? l will fix him up if l get him. l'm good at that. Pulling out nails, tweezing fingers, cutting tongue. . . Whatever you can think of, l'm able to do it. l will get the props. Yeah... Uncle Hwa, what do you think? You can join at that time. Just standing though. That's good. We should tie him on the roof top of Langham Place. Until the thunder comes. Education really makes a difference, you can be so cruel! Maybe...just let him go. No? Uncle Hwa. How could you say that? You did that? Of course not. . . No? You're sweating! - No... - Uncle Hwa... Your legs are shaking hard, l can feel it from here. l keep losing my panties, you must be the one stealing them! l didn't, l'm innocent. l just threw out the acids! lt's you! l have been running my store here for 40 years. The landlord keeps raising my rent every year. l've been forced to move my store from G/F to 2/F and so on. . . Why did you do this to Jade? l didn't mean to hurt her. l got the letter about the raise in rent that night, l threw the acids out of anger. l just did it once, l will turn myself in. At least he didn't hurt Jade. l don't think you're the one who did it! You're so educated, how could you do such thing? - Yeah. . . - You've got nothing to do with this. . . Don't talk about Uncle Hwa. Let's talk about this, okay? What do you mean? There's only one thing we're talking about! Uncle Hwa's got nothing to do with this! Let's not mention his name anymore. . . - Yeah. . . - l am really... What did you say? - You're at such age... - Don't mention his name anymore Think about it... lf we can no longer run our business, and we all got kicked out, Who will benefit the most? The landlord. But if we all got kicked out, who will pay him the rent? Why did he have to raise our rent then? Recently, there's been a large sum of money from mainland for buying the golden mile in different places. Now they bought those in Shinjuku. l heard the core person is in Hong Kong right now. So they're trying to kick us out. . . without paying any compensation! Let's protest! lf they don't want to talk this out, we'll splash them with red paint. Splash them with red paint! l want a cold one. Just a sec, sir. lced lemon tea with little sugar, thanks. We can't just sit here. We have to burn or paint something as we protest. Don't mess around here. They gave us a spot for gathering, dare you mess up. Yes, we are here to convey our opinion. Don't mess things up! They gave us drinks too, we are here to find the mainlander. We are all Hong Kong people, don't mess around. - Come on... - Everybody. Our boss wants to talk. . . to you guys. May l please ask all representatives to come with me. We are going then. Yes, okay...let's go. What? l want to go too. Yeah? You go for me then. You have such a fierce look. Remember, don't blabber. Yes, darling. Be fierce. . . l... actually wanted to buy the whole Sai Yeung Choi street. After l checked it out myself, l finally understood why this street is so popular. lt is not because of the location, but its people. . . Everyone is helping each other out mutually. The customers are coming here... for your sincerity. Good... Very good. Well said! So if l just buy out the street, only the landlord will be benefited. So l'm gonna drop my original plan. lnstead, l will buy another street next to this one. And l will ask everyone to come here and open their new store... How much will the rent be? Not only will l not raise your rent but also exempt your rent... for three years! Great! Exempted for three years. But everybody, please come. - There should be... - Should be, but... Yes, but what? But what?... Everybody. New Sai Yeung Choi street, a new concept. l'm thinking of. . . using old customs with new ideas. ln the past two days, l saw a young guy open his own store on your street. lt's very creative! My son drew this... lt's my son's. . . No, it's my son's idea, he just stole it. - Listen to me. - That's my son's work. The two young men are here today. Here already? Young fellows, come. . . - Dad! - Dad! l like his creativity but l like his honesty much more Because he stole the creativity from him. Since he dares to bring him up here to see me, l decided. . . to let these two young fellows take over the whole project. . . in the new Sai Yeung Choi street. Okay. Let's celebrate. . .hotpot! lt's not good enough, let's have a carnival instead! That's too wasteful... lt's okay. . . Why are you following me? Only you can do that? lt's not moving at all, are we stuck? Are you trying to scare me? You didn't press. l'm sorry. . . What is it? Maybe we broke the elevator. Shorty... Where the hell are you? Come out! Don't think you can scare me with this. Trying to scare me? You dropped my BBQ pork on the ground, so l licked it clean. Sorry. What's that sound? lt's okay, the cable is a bit loose. The cable is loose? Will the elevator fall down? lt's like playing the free falling machine. This is not the free falling machine, we can die. Die? Too soon! l haven't been to Disneyland, l haven't seen Donnie Yen... l haven't dated and l haven't held hands before. . . l haven't been kissed before... Stop pretending! l wanted to kiss you to distract... and ease you out. Come on, feeling better now? Yeah. Because l'm holding your hand. Stop hitting my head again, it hurts. Why don't you let go of my hand? You could beat me so hard with just one hand. lf l let go of your hand, l would be dead meat! l'm so sorry. Don't worry about it, as long as l can help you. Shit! How long are we gonna be stuck here? lt's like l can't breathe. lt's the problem of focusing. l have a good way of distracting your focus. You hit my head again! Sorry. You kiss me, l hit you. That's fair, l feel better this way. l got it. l want 1 0 then. Miss, are you okay? l'm fine, not sure about him though. l told you not to hit my head. Sorry, but your head is such a good target. l know, they call me "Hitting head easily" Thanks. Let's try this some other time. Are you the family of Shek Kin? No, l'm Shek Kin. What is it? l'm rushing to get off, make it short. You're suffering. . . from testos. . .genesis. . . of 'bacteria-ticula' er 'gem-cell' er 'ticula-gem-cell-tumous' What is it? That's testicular cancer. - Testicular cancer? - Yes. - l got testicular cancer? - Yes. Are you sure? l haven't used it in so many years. Doctor, are you sure l got testicular cancer? Please calm down... This disease has nothing to do with how long you haven't used it. . . l'm really in a hurry to get on the shuttle bus. Tomorrow...let's talk about it tomorrow. No, doctor... Look, it's true. No, doctor... My swollen testes...why. . . Sh...Shek Kin? My English name is Shek Chin. . . Ha...that's not me. He deserves this. Kin, why are you... What? l know it's hard to talk about the testes. But l never thought that you. . .that's pathetic. . . lt's English though, do you understand it? You haven't even completed your primary school! lt's got an illustration, doesn't it look like you? Kin, l never thought you'd get such a terminal disease. lf l knew that, l would have let you have Hong. That's alright, right? Bastard, you've changed, now that you know l'm sick. lt's not too late. . . if you really want me to be happy. Bastard, do you have to cry like hell? You won't be here for long though. What about this, you can go out with Hong. . . on those special occasions. lt's okay to be late, l won't mind. Are you sure? Tomorrow's my birthday. Bastard, such a coincidence? Come on! Alright, you just want to spend your birthday with Hong. l will tell her, my treat, where do you wanna go? You stingy bastard, you'll probably treat me to McDonald's. No, thanks. You probably can't eat much. That's okay, we are buddies. You're so broke, you even cheat on bus fares. l should take advantage since you're treating for once! You know...this disease l have... l'm gonna die soon... l'd like to have abalone. . . You son of a bitch, have you really got such a good appetite while suffering from cancer? You'll die of suffocation from eating an abalone! Abalone! That's right! l bought so many abalone last year. l'd even feed my cat with it. Come to my place then. Are you sure? l will empty my stomach to eat up all your abalone. You know l don't eat much. Six or seven will do. You will see, l will force you to buy me something expensive. That is it, okay? By the way, although it's your first time coming to my place, you don't need to buy me anything. No way, l'd buy some bananas at least. l have planted some at my place, it's ripe now. l miss the way you eat bananas... What a buddy! You still remember l like bananas. We are buddies! Bananas. . . Banana! Banana... Okay, see you tomorrow. Honey! Do you need to be so dressed up? Am l beautiful? We're eating at home. Pajamas are fine. We're celebrating Kin's birthday. And, it's his last time... You shouldn't say that later, he'll probably mind that. Look at you, your eyelashes are too long, it's falling off. ls it? l'll go and fix it... Where are the photos? Oh, they're here. This one is the most important Here. Hong, remember me. . . Don't need that. . . - Get the hell out of here. - Bro Kin. - Hong. - You're so handsome! Should l wear. . . a shroud to match your clothing? No need, we are so close. Hope you don't mind the dishes, be my guest. . . What do you mean? Honey! Yes. . .my wife made lots of dishes for you. She said there's no need to watch your diet for cancer. Thanks for your concern... - How sweet... - Of course. The sewing bag is so nice, my photo is on it too. Of course, you have such a lofty status in our family. l put you next to my ancestors, as we're offering incense, see... you have such a lofty status in our family too. Your photo is put next to my ancestors, although it's a bit blurry. - Bro Kin, - Hong, - come sit over here. - let's have a chat. . . - Okay... - No need. - Finish earlier to get going. - No... Hong, you cooked so much for me? - Thanks a lot. . . - Yes, Bro Kin. Have a seat. Come on, sit down. . . Kin, it's ready now, come on. . . - Hong. . . - Yes. There is chicken, fish, prawn and my favorite sweet and sour pork... What about abalone? Where's the abalone? - Did you buy it? - l brought it back this afternoon. No... l put it at the back. These are the used buns for cats... from downstairs. Do you want it? l'd better put it away. Hong, let's have some wine. For your having cancer. . . Honey, you have a Louis Xlll, right? Take it out and let's drink that. l've been saving that for my 60th birthday though. Today is Kin's birthday, go ahead. Take death anniversary for birthday. Hong. . . How are you, Hong. . . Help watching over mom. What the hell! What's so important? Big news, dad. Shek Kin doesn't have testicular cancer. What? How do you know that? l just went for a movie with Kinny. He suddenly stuck his tongue out and said he wanted to kiss me. l said that's okay, but he had to tell me a secret first. Then he told me about this. Well... Why did he stick his tongue out though? Now is not the time for this. Dad, what should we do now? Take our precious out! Louis Xlll? Louis the hell. Come here. Bro Kin... Haven't seen you for years, you went to learn acupuncture and massage? l have been practicing for years just for today. Honey! Did you find your Louis Xlll? Yes, l also found something else. You know we're celebrating Kin's birthday, in fact... all l want is to kill him. . .no! To save his life. Save his life? How? Even the latest medical treatment could do nothing about cancer. But we do have a secret therapy. Have you ever heard of any emperors with testicular cancer? No. That's right. Where did you get this secret therapy? Well... The last eunuch Li Lian Ying... took it away from the Forbidden City. Then he gave it to his great-grandson, Jet Li. Jet is my buddy, so he gave this to me. Jet Li is the great-grandson of Li Lian Ying? Li Lian Ying was an eunuch, don't you know that? He fostered that. . . Here it is, Killing 14. They're still moving. Of course, it's vital. Are you sure, honey? Have you ever heard of a cockroach with cancer? No. That's right. Sounds quite scientific. Bro Kin, you have to try, come on. l'd better bring it home and chill it, okay? Okay. . .take it back... Shit! l pulled out the cover, it has to be finished in 3 minutes. Daughter, hold him. Let go of me. . . Why don't you let me drink? Kin... Let me do it myself. l have to drink it anyway, come on. Kin... Have you got any grasshopper or something. . . Bring them all out! Don't be so impetuous. l'm now telling you. This is not for drinking, it's just for external use. You drank it, then... Bro Kin, are you okay? Never mind, l have a last move. lf you eat this, it'll be leveled off. Daughter, bring it out. You have to eat it alive. Are you done with this? What? That's what l should ask you. Trying to fool us for having testicular cancer? What? Bro Kin, you don't have cancer? He wants to grab your boobs too, you can ask our aughter. Yes, mom. He really wants to grab your boobs. You could just say yes though. Why did you lie to me? Hong, l'm sorry... After all, l just want to see you. And l know you care for me so much. You have been making soup for me all these years... Stop! What did you say? l don't get it. What soup? The soup that you have, l have it too. Maybe l started drinking it before you did! ls that true? You made soup for him? No, honey... Bro Kin's wife passed away a long time ago, he's so pathetic. l have to make soup anyways, so l gave some to him too. So you give him everything that he doesn't have? He doesn't have a luxury apartment, should you buy him one? He has no one to sleep with, do you have to sleep with him too? What did you say? We have been married for so many years, why don't you trust me? We used to be good friends. Why do we have to be like feudists? What the hell is that? You shut up! She married you not to be scolded by you! l never thought of that l gave her money and she made soup for you. Hell knows whether you two slept together or not? How could l possibly have a son so tall? How could l know if he's mine or not? l think you forgot what you told me before. l'll take good care of Hong. l never thought that you would say that to me. Where's she going? What do you think? Go after her, you bastard! - Honey... - Hong. . . - lt's all because of you! - lt's all because of you! - Saying such nonsense! - Saying such nonsense! "Be more hunger for more reward." "Being enjoy much, why not strive for it." "There will be new planets every day, bring yours into full play." Why are you dancing so hard? You familiar with Kelly? She's my classmate. This mainlander is so rich, even Kelly's invited. l hear Madonna will be here soon. Kelly is awesome. She just gave birth to her son. And she's still so pretty. She can still sing and dance like before. "Go with the trend, go for your girl." Don't be silly, she use to study at a girl's school. Me too! Let's get a baby... for ourselves after this, okay? Which part of you looks like a woman? What the hell! Dad. Okay. What is it? Do you miss mom? Of course. Just go and find her, is it that hard to say sorry? Where can l find her though? She has never run away for so long. She used to go downstairs to have a wonton noodle when she was upset. At most... she'd go for a Chinese opera. l don't know about this time. . . "Leaving for being suspected by someone," "not sure to hate you or not." "Maybe it's all my fault, l just don't know." ls this song nice? The name of this song is. . . "lt's all my fault" Yes, it's all my fault. l promised to take good care of her forever. . . But the problem is l still have half of my life left, l would... Love her much and treat her better every day. l don't care about anything anymore. When she tells me to go left, l wouldn't go right. She likes Jacky Cheung, l wouldn't play Wan Kwong. lf l see her, l won't say l'm gonna take care of her forever. l'll say, l will love her for 1 0,000 years. lsn't that cool? Yeah. l'm going back. You'll have the chance to apologize to mom. Before that, should you go to talk to someone though? So that you can tell mom about it to cheer her up. Dad. Yes, sweetie. What did they say over there? ls Hong back yet? No, Uncle Ha is so worried about her. He deserves it! How could he treat his wife like that? l hope that Hong will never come back to him. Dad, don't say that. Madam Ha has left, don't you worry about her? lf you didn't quarrel with Uncle Ha all the time, she wouldn't have left. How can you keep quarreling with him like that? Excuse me... How coincident? lt's so crowded today. Yeah. Every store is opened as usual. We've been neighbors for over 1 0 years. Yeah, l remember when l set up my mobile phone shop here, you set up yours on the other side. No, you were after me. What did you say? l took this unit first. Then you rushed to set up your shop once you saw this. Are you sure? 1 1 th August was my grand opening. Yours opened on Friday the 1 3th! l remember that! What Friday the 1 3th ? Mine was on 8th August, it's easy to remember. Dare you argue for this? You can ask Madam Garbage for this. Just ask her then. Do you need to be so devoted? We're not having a real carnival. Carnival? Right! Celebrating is a cover-up for our operation. ls there someone throws acids here recently? Yeah! You are the target. l was suspecting someone, but l wasn't too sure. Then l took a detailed investigation on her and l found something. Do you know this person? Bing? Bing? Let's go! Don't expect you can get out. No... Help me... Dad. . . Something is thrown! Roof top of No. 49. My wife's shoes! Will she be upstairs? Hurry! . . . l'll get her from the other side. Wait for me, l can watch over you if you get stuck in the elevator. - Are you okay? - l'm fine. Get going then, come on. . . Over there! Hurry! Someone throws acids from the roof top of No. 49. Don't run away, it's all acids. Why does it turn out like this? Someone is over there. Who is it? Do you know her? Someone throws acids from the roof top of No. 49. So crowded. Why did you do this? Still need to ask? To get you guys all up here! You are insane... Kid... Stop that! We are all neighbors. Why do you. . . have to do this to us? Yes. You recognize me? Why do you have to ask so much... if you know who my father is? l'm here for revenge. Revenge? Your dad used to mess with us and we did nothing at all, what's the revenge for? My father was caught by Officer Chan. lt's because your father forced Hong to marry Officer Chan. Don't you get it? Because she refused to marry him, my father was caught and... And what?. . . And was punished! He couldn't take that and he was gone! That's good. . . He died! That's pathetic...what a pity... Just come with me. Why should l? l almost forgot. l'm an undercover, l'm a cop. Come with me to the police station. You can't get me. Honey! - Honey! - Don't do that! She's sitting on top of the tanks filled with acids. When l press this button, all the tanks will blow up. Then acid rain will fall over the whole Sai Yeung Choi street. . . You wanna save her? Once she leaves the chair, the bomb will blow too. You want your revenge? You can raise our rent like your father did. You can kick us out. You don't have to make such a big fuss. My father was screwed because of this woman. lf she married the officer, everything would have been fine. You guys wanna help her? Then die for her. No... Stop that. . . l've been delivering cards here. . . for over 20 years, it really counts. The bomb is voice-activated. When l say the password thrice, it will blow up. Bastard! Bastard! Bas. . . l make tons of fish balls every month, do you think l'm dumb? Great! Po, why did you do this? You're so young and with such a good figure. Why do you have to seek for revenge? You bastard! Boss, what bastard! Am l wrong? You bastard. Yes. Don't worry, l'll call the bomb experts. lt will blow up before the bomb experts get here. You leave with the neighbors. Don't worry, just go with them. Son, l'll save your mom, you go ahead. Go. You evacuate the crowd. Go. . . Hurry... Be careful, dad. Be careful. Honey, are you okay? Why did you get tied up here? Two minutes left, let me help you. . . Don't touch it! Do you really know how? lt's the same in every movie. lt's either the blue one or red one. Once l cut it, the bomb will be deactivated. Which one will you pick then? lf it's not the red one, then it's the blue one! Red or blue? Old rule. Heads for red, tails for blue. Give me a coin! You toss, l get it. Hurry. . . You toss. . . Would you please toss... Let me get it. Bro Kin... For so many years, l know how you've been treating me. ln fact, both of you are so nice to me. Whenever something happens to me, you two are here with me. Even if time could draw back, l really don't know how to choose. Honey. . . For all we've been through these years, this time, it's the matter of life and death, l want you to toss for me. Come on. l love you, honey! Why do you stop me? Let's try taking the battery away, maybe the clock will stop. Right. lt stopped! Honey! . . . Honey, it's over now. l'm just too smart. Didn't l tell you to leave? How could we leave at this moment? We are all good neighbors. Yeah!... We've checked. lf all the acids here blow up at the same time, it'd be more dangerous on the street. Yeah! Good! Hey, you two. Let's go back and have some soup.
