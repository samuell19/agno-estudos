Everywhere, and ever since that day, I've never been able to look at, other gingerbread house the same. - Thank you, Ms Howard for that brave for telling me. Next time on Christmas holiday, we'll be hearing him. - Oh my God. - Hey baby. - There's so much to do. - Anything I can help with? Maybe I can go clear up the spare prop area. - Yes, there's all this stuff from the feminist show. - Okay. - That is probably Lloyd, can you let him in, but don't let him talk to me yet. - I'll see what I can do. - Lacey, Lacey, Lacey, hey Lacey, so I, don't hate me, but I have some changes I'd like to go over with you. - No. - But, all right, I'll just go over with the actors then, right? - No, no changes. - But-- - It's the morning of... I told you. - But-- - Hey, uh, what can I do with this? - Put it in the back. - Argh! I'll have to deflate it. - No, he almost broke last time, just put him in the back. - Baby, I don't think there's going to be room. - Make it fit. - Alright. - Okay, but anyway, during the last course of Merry Christmas, what does it mean? I want the angels to drop to an A, instead of maybe what the-- - Lloyd. - What? - I don't care, no! - But what, what, let me just talk to them-- - No. And we'll see what they say, right? - It's the morning now, you're going to confuse them, no. - But can we just see what happens? - Damn it! No, no, Nope. - I'm talking alone. - Hi, my name is Lacey, and I am the manager, at the little stage theater here in Fort Scott, Kansas. We are so excited to be running for this state grant. I mean, out of all the other great arts organizations here in Kansas, just to be considered as such an honor. I mean, my parents ran it for a while after that, but now here I am, myself and my boyfriend, friend, boyfriend, we live together, Christmas. What does it mean is an original piece, by one of our very own playwrights Lord Schumer. And we are all very excited, and obvious a little nervous. - Terrible idea, but I've passed the theater onto, my daughter and I don't say anything. Nobody asks for my opinions, so I don't give them. I can be humble. - The tour of the little stage. And this is where the magic is conjured. - Lacey, my name isn't printed in the program. - I just stop by, from time to time just to, make sure that everything is going well. Just in case I need to take the reins back, momentarily. - Look alive Clementine. - Jingle bells, you're looking swell. Unlike this backdrop. Hey Olivia, can I get another pen? - Six hours 'til show time, people. Get into costume, I want everyone on stage. For our first talk through in 15 minutes, okay? - Andrew couldn't watch Henry tonight, So he's got to park it in the green room. - Okay. Anyone have eyes on my - Hello, hey, look at you. You look beautiful. - I look like my mom. - I know, your mom is beautiful. Wait-- - Lloyd. No not like that, not like that, oh God, damn it, bullshit. - Anyone have eyes on my pillow? - Where is my beard? I left it right here next to my Clippers last night. - Sorry Chloe, I just wanted to be prepared, in case something happened to you on the way over. Not that I thought that it would, but-- - This is not all about Eve. - I got it warm for you. - Uh, hey, I am Amy, do I talk to... You can talk to me, yeah. - Okay. Hey, hey, I'm Amy, I'm the understudy for everyone. And as the understudy, I take my job very seriously. So if anyone is late or is looking a little ill, I just have to be on my A game all the time. Um, yeah, I've read the script over and over and over again. So I know everybody's lines, frontwards and backwards. You know, some might even they say that, I know the script better than the actual cast. - Hey, I'm Keith Solomon, I am Lacey's boyfriend, and I can't talk too much about the show, but she wanted me to definitely be sure to say that, it's going to be really great family entertainment. Oh, can you keep a secret? Oh, yeah. Wow. - Yeah. - Wow. - Hey everyone, how's it going? How we doing, merry merry, we're here to spread some Christmas cheer, right? Well. - Can I get anybody, some coffee, some water, anything like that? No. - Okay, okay. Well, let me know if you have any stage fright, or anything like that. I brought some toms toms with me, kind of subtle that tummy, you know? - How is everyone doing today? Merry Christmas, cheer. - Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. - I'm heading to the kitchen, can I grab anyone anything? - Hot, cocoa, hot cocoa. - Yeah, can I get like two of those also, like some super hot cocoa? - Yeah. - Cool, thank you. - Yeah, you welcome. - Yeah, yeah, appreciate it. What? - Stop! - What? - I'm Right here. - I know. Just, just cause I'm on a diet, doesn't mean I can't look at the menu, it's all good. - This is a real diamond, and it's white gold and it was my Nana's. She-- - Aaaww! - They were married in Europe. - Hey yo, Lacey, look. Hey, I'm so excited for the show tomorrow night. I can't wait to sparkle for you. I'm not going to let you down. - What do you mean? If it's tonight, tonight... - What? - The show us tonight, we talked about this at rehearsal every week, and I sent you a hundred emails. Do you not read the emails I send you? - You mean like, like Gmail? Like one that parents use? - Jo Jay is Sage's boyfriend, and Sage is our leading lady, who brings in half of our audience. So when she brought him into the audition, we thought, what could go wrong? - Those curl legs split like banana peel, looking like a Sunday. Thank God that ass is real. I make noise, Got the toys, like a happy meal. I beat the like I'm sponsored by badges seal. I don't rap. I just vocally lip smack get back, when I opened these up. In fact chipmunk, let you chop this, Quick that's what getting close to me does. Yeah, am make your girl twice, like Christ got the chocolate. I can stop vanilla ice, ice, ice. Cause then I'm lying on my spine. About twice my height I could make, want it to the right, right, right. Joe. - Yeah baby that was awesome. - Thank you baby. Jo Jay. - Oh my Gosh. - Jo Jay out. - Mmh, that's mine! - So the bottom line is, Sage said she would leave, if we didn't cast him. So here we are, we'll be fine. - Hey? - Hello, Most beautiful woman in the entire world? - How long until that's done? And have you seen Alexander or James cause, I need them in costume for rehearsal now. - Yes. - Where are they? - James said something about, documenting vocal warmups. - No, no, no, no, no, no. - Yep. - No. - It starts in the back of the throat, and then I move it towards the front, near the tip of my tongue. Then I'm going to swirl around in my mouth, like a bird, and then I let it take flight. Yes, just like that. Now this next warm up, it's very technical. Okay, don't try it at home without guidance. It's been perfected over the course of 30 years by monks, and I have been able to do it fast in six months. Goes little something like this. ♪ Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel, ♪ ♪ Born is the king of the... ♪ - When I say, get on stage for rehearsal, in costume in 15 minutes. What do you hear? - Sorry, we'll be right there. ♪ We'll be right there, we'll be... ♪ - Well get in the costume. It's healthy to invoke a little fear sometimes, my mother always says. - Uh, we were just, we getting into costume, and learning some lines. We'll get ready, sorry. - Angels do not have blue hair. - It, is a character choice. - I'm one of those actors, that just grew up with a natural ability for the stage. Has it been rough? Yeah, of course. The life of a servant is a tortured one. But I am so lucky to be surrounded by people who support me, and reminds me when I'm down that my talent, is a gift to the world, not a burden. - 10 Years, 10 thankless years. And I am only angel number one. - Yeah this is a piece of a... well I've been well been working on, for about five years now, and I finally said to myself, I said, Lloyd, it's time to let this baby birth itself. I got the idea from my two greatest inspirations, Charles Koski and David Mamet. It's very progressive and everything. Something how, a lot of people don't really seem, to understand around here. This is a musical. - It is, Yes, oh, you have no idea. I don't know if I even have an idea anyway, this has gone through about seven or eight different drafts, but the original one had more of a realistic sense, of what it is to be alone in the holidays. - So, it's, - Ta-ta-ta - Ta-at-ta right on feet - Now that's the canter. - Oh no, that's the canter? - We're doing the trot now. - Doing the trot? - Okay. - So the trot... - Do you know the difference between the trot and canter? - Yes. - Okay. Cool, then do it. Here we go, five, six, seven, eight and one, two, three. Ta-ta-ta Okay, yeah, that's I mean, hopefully we don't get like a horse knowledge audience. - Yes, of course, I think our sense of community, runs really deep here. I mean, there is only one thing, at the end of the day that can really hold together, such an intense art form for that long and... - Well, it ain't talent, I'll tell you that much. - Mom. - I'm just here to support. - Can I speak to you, off camera? This is my day, mine. You handed me the keys and I thought I changed the locks. - You really think that that old changing the lock thing, is going to keep me out? You need me Lacey, you know you do. If you don't get this grant, everything we have ever known about this family, is gonna be done. - You just think I don't know that? You being here is not saving anything. - Oh tell that to the bills that keep piling up. I told you not to have the air conditioning running, all day, every day. Oh, but the actors, they're getting so warm, in their costume... - I know mom. - And the catering, my God Lacey! - I know, I know we need the grant. - And why is Keith here? - Mom Haven't you told him... - Mom it's complicated, Okay? - Oh, what? You won't have someone to make you breakfast in the morning? Oh yes, that's very complicated. - I'm Catherine Bloom, and I'm with the state of Kansas, theater arts, music arts and dance arts board, which is a subcommittee of, the state of Kansas board of arts education. And I'm here to, to judge this production. You know, we have a new grant. We have a new grant this year, which is so exciting. And yeah, I'm here to judge this production, along with several others across the state, on how well they meet our grant criteria, which are Kansas inclusion, Christian values, sorghum production and diversity. - It would mean the absolute world for our family, it would literally keep our world together. The little stage theater faces the threat, of closing its doors forever. Well, I just can't imagine seeing it end like that, with, with the whimper. ♪ Angles sweet have had on high ♪ ♪ Sweetly singing on the play ♪ ♪ And the mountains in reply ♪ ♪ Echoing Joy's tray ♪ Oh it just, echoes off these walls. That's how you keep the lights on. - Yeah, I'm in the play. I'm not the lead or anything, but, I'm in it. Yes, I am Lloyd's longterm girlfriend. Relationships are hard, you know? And it's not always glamorous, being with someone in the business, but we make it work, it's special. - Yeah sometimes, I mean, it's been on and off, you know like, and when I say on and off, I mean, it's probably like three or four times a year, that we break up so... - He really has what he calls a vision, and he likes to do it, and I get to watch. - Yeah, we get along, for the most part. - I call him Ggoyd. Okay. - And he says, "stop it, stop it." And he likes to growl. - Everything, she's usually like, how you should probably, like calm down every once in a while. And I was like, well, I don't know if I need to. - "Stop it, you knock it off." "You keep calling Ggoyd" I do it for the growl. Okay, is this your first performance, with the little stage theater? - Is that where I am now? Yeah. - Yeah. Well, okay. Julie in there, honey? - It was my turn Lloyd. - Yeah, well we all have our turns in life, and sometimes it's just not our turn. - Are you high? - Well... - Great guys, for real, show time. It's getting close, we can all get out here now. - Do I have enough glitter on? I'm Karen Kane, that's my stage name. Um, and I have been with the little stage theater, for at least 10 years now, and it has been such a blessing. I mean, as an actress, it is just a gift, to have a place like this, where you could just flex your muscles, you know? I mean, in small towns, when you get tied, settled down and have children and your husband can't bear, the thought of being more than 10 minutes away from his mother, places like this are, a gift. - All right guys, lets keep going, oh, come on. - Yeah, Lacey I have some questions, about my solo performance. - What are you talking about? - From the new opening scene? - There is no new opening, and what on earth Chloe? - Wait, Lloyd said that... - Someone call for me Lloyd. - Wait, does this mean my new monologue is cut too? - Olivia, you are an angel. - So, there's no opening act? - How Lloyd, wait, where, where is Lloyd? There are no changes. The script is what we rehearsed last night, and the night before, and the night before, and the night before, someone call me Lloyd. - I'm on it honey cakes. - Chloe go change now. - Wait can I at least show you, it's amazing. - Mm, no. - It's like, ♪hulk, from the future ♪ - No. - I wanna be a girl. - Are you okay? - I'm fine. ♪ Oh holy night the stars are brightly shining ♪ ♪ It is the night of our dear savior's birth ♪ ♪ Lonely the world in sin and error pining ♪ ♪ Till he appeared and the... ♪ - Why are you looking at me like that? - What, what? - It's like we didn't, you're like now retaining, what we practice. - Bullshit, I'm just like looking for the cues, you know? - Yeah, like where are you right now? Where's your head? Do you understood - Okay. - Lacey, So I don't have to do it, with the Christmas tree either. - No, you were just the factory foreman, the coachman and the arborist. Please, please just stick to the script, we've been rehearsing for weeks. - Okay, fine I'm not upset that, I just spent an hour learning an entire song. I will use it to inform my performance, of the foreman's frail masculinity. - They are really looking at. - What? I don't have to conform to specific gender ideas. - We usually never have enough men, in the company for all the guy roles that are written. So I usually get stuck as the backup dude, which is great. I don't mind. What's one more for the patriarchy. Hey Sage? - Oh sorry, yeah sorry, coming on soon. - So tell us about this play. - Yeah, the play is going fine. I'm really enjoying the process, but you know, make or break my career One of my goals is to move to one of the coasts, and launch myself help podcast. Oh. - Yeah, transcendental, meditation, self realization, and manifestation is so important to me, and Kansas doesn't have what I need. Oh my God, can I tell you a Christmas joke? Sure. - Okay so how do we know for sure, that Jesus wasn't born in Kansas? How? - Because they couldn't have found, three wise men, and a virgin. Oh, seriously, I hate it here. - Probably the most challenging part of this, has been my choreography. - And a five, six, seven, eight. - You know it. - Yes, hello everyone, thank you. Yes thank you so much. We are the premier choreographer duo, in this town. My name is Savannah and this beefcake, over here is ex military, but active duty in my heart, my husband Benjamin. - Now, all do get in the circle, start running. Run. - Run. - Five, six seven, eight, jump. - Keep sliding, keep going. - Can we be cast this? Big smiles, like you've got Vaseline, in your teeth. Big smile, alright here we go. So turn around I'll count two and jumping on. - You're a genius, You're a god. Don't let them diminish your light, okay? - I'm a god, I am god. - Lighter, lighter, lighter, lighter, lighter. - I can't, I'm sorry, it's like... - And today to honor one very special person, for the most improvement in this session, I will be doing a ribbon celebration to Angelica. Please come into the middle for a ribbon celebration. Receiving blessing, receiving blessings. - I want you to stop. - Oh, okay, we're done, we're done with that. Thank you very much. - Do you know how to dance? - Uh, yeah. - Dance. - Keep your feet on the ground. - Okay. - Dance. There you go, there you go. - Oh yeah. - Keep dancing, stand up.

Great and... - What's your name? - And your name is? - Amy, you can call me something else if you want. - No, Amy really suits you. - Huh? - Amy, I was once a loser like you. I know it's really hard to imagine, but I had a lot of self confidence issues. Just like you have and I had a really like scared, stupid face all the time just like you have. - Oh, cool. - But there's so much hope for you. When I found ribbon dancing, or whenever dancing found me, I was able to take all the bullying, and the pain that I experienced in middle school, and high school and put it into the ribbon. Just put it into the ribbon. And when I did that, I won a silver medal, in the 2016 state championship... - Wow! - You can be successful like me, just stop being such a, fraidy cat little loser girl... - Okay, I'll try. - Get it baby, get it baby. - Thank you, thank you. - We ended up only having, one day of rehearsals. Turns out that Savannah was only out on bail, for a couple of days. Okay, once again, like I said, there are no deviations from the script we've rehearsed. So everyone in their places from the top. Stop, stop, stop Alexander, why you shirtless? - Oh, this is the scene where I'm shirtless. - There is no scene where he was shirtless. - Wait, if he's not wearing a shirt, can I go topless as well? - No. - Actually that's a good idea. - Guys! - I mean, have you ever seen a Trinium wearing a shirt, or a tree wearing a shirt? That'd be like a human, wearing clothes made out of humans. - Boom! - I'm gonna count to three, - Nooooo. - One, two. ♪ Yeah born again been given time to grow ♪ ♪ I was touched by Lord Christ, and that began to show ♪ ♪ Got the true Christmas spirit inside of me ♪ ♪ From root to stem and stem to leaf ♪ ♪ Today I'm call the small town tree ♪ ♪ But I don't belong to them they belong to me ♪ ♪ You see, I was here long, long ago ♪ ♪ Before settlers trains, farm towns and Brooks ♪ ♪So let me take y'all back, to a time before ♪ ♪I was visited by angels ♪ ♪ From the Lord, don't need no tensile at Christmas gift ♪ ♪ When Christ was born, I was part of this shit ♪ Jo Jay. - Jo Jay, hey? - Yeah? - Why aren't you in costume? - What do you mean? - Costume, where is your costume? - Like the tree?

Wait, besides I need you, I love you, and I believe in you. Please go put a tree on. - But, but I've got something really important, that I wanted to do tonight.

I'll go out there, and tell them how the ship will sail. This is the Titanic, on this maiden voyage. You are a virgin, on the high seas. - Lloyd, hey buddy. I can't have you go out there right now. I got to keep you out from, in front of the cameras. Can you promise me you'll just stay right here? - I was meant for the stage. I am a playwright. - Oh, for sure you are. Yeah, no, no one doubts that, but you just can't be one right now, okay. Just stay right here, be cool. - Okay, no, I will not be controlled... - Don't drink that, that's not for you. - I wasn't going to drink this. Why would I do that? - Hey, hon. - Hey Keith, I don't have time. Thanks for putting the Christmas tree on. - Oh yeah, Of course. I just want to say how proud of you, I really am. You know? - Thanks, that's really kind of you. - And I know you've been working really hard.

And so just exploring that, is something that, it gets me up in the morning. - Andrew doesn't do rehearsals, I mean, he nails it every time, so we just let him do him. - I'll start where it begins with a Christmas dream, like many before, but this one is special. Unlike anything you've ever heard, or seen. - When you start on that note, it throws everything off for me. - I'm on the right note, you're supposed to be harmonizing. - Not for this song. You got these confused every time. - You were a little off. - I'm sorry, did someone ask for your opinion? - Stop. - I didn't - Stop, stop, Olivia. From the humming please, okay? - Stop smiling. - Every time, Take five! - Finally. Yeah, she was flat. Okay, my mom was an opera singer, my dad wrote for the orchestra. I have perfect pitch. - Wanna hear my impression of Olivia? Sure. - Listen. - I'm a stupid little bitch. - But actually she has a pretty good range. We could all hear it, when she's, running lines with Jesse in the dressing room. - She concentrates better in the dark, a lot better. - This is my first like, professional job. - What's all this hoopla about-- - Angelica shut up. - Hoopla about Christmas anyway. - How do I look?

Just, as friends. - Hunter, that was wonderful, but maybe don't give it a hundred percent quite yet, like save some for the performance. - I wasn't. - Hunter is a good actor, I won't deny that. But there's a difference between being a good actor, being a good person, and his singing is, I'm not jealous. Hunter is good at what he does, but I think anyone would be good, if they were afforded the same time and privilege.

We are going to stir the primordial emotions, that live in the hearts of every one, of those audience members. We are going to create, Yes, you got this. - I'm truly proud of you guys too. - Cool. - All right, wow. - I'm gonna throw up. - Am gonna do that, what is it. - I'm very nervous, I mean, was Napoleon nervous about Waterloo? Was Nixon worried about Watergate? Of course I'm nervous. But the bottom line is, I believe in my team. And no good manager who cares about the craft isn't nervous. It's because we care, it's because we love, and that love, is gonna manifest itself, into the magic of the theater. - Hey, good luck, take your nails off. Hey, good luck. You got this. - Is anyone gonna frigging show up? - Trust the process Karen, it gonna be fine. And that's the power of manifestation. - No, but seriously where are all these people coming from? - Mama has fast hands, this ain't my first rodeo. - Lacey we've sailed so many seas together, and I've planted many seeds. No, if I'm a tree, maybe you could be my stone. No standing in front of a girl. Yeah, yeah, that's a good, that's better, that's better, Lacey you drive me crazy-- - I hate this place. - I'm so afraid, I'm gonna look like an idiot, doing something I'm just totally not prepared for. Argh, Nana's ring! - What's that? - Weed mint, you want one? - Why would I want that? I am a professional. I don't need to be high to be talented, Olivia. - Just thought you might want a little 'calm me' down. I don't need to calm down Olivia. - Okay seriously Karen, you need to relax-- - Don't, don't touch me, I am going to be fine. I am calm. - Mhmm. - What, what are you all looking at? Did you all talk about this? Is this is this what everyone thinks? Oh, let's just give Karen a little weed. Maybe it'll make our lives a little easier. You think this is hard? You think I'm hard? This is child's play, and you amateurs have a lot to learn. If you think this is a real theater. If you have only known what I have seen, in this world and survived as a human, and as a mother. You'd be crawling at my feet right now. I know you all think, I am some grachety bitch, who shouldn't be a mother. But let me just tell you one thing, I am a good mother-- - Mama - Shut up! - Can I have a mint? - Yeah. - I want two. - Have as many as you want girl. - I'm taking three. - You know frustrations is-- - Shut up Hunter. - We like to call it the pre-show Karen explosion. - Okay, everyone, we've made it this far. Let's just please make it to the show, okay? Hunter, fix your bender. Karen, get it together. Everyone, Let's get mind up. Amy, stop farting. - Okay, We can do this. - Hey, break a branch, okay? - Welcome everyone, thank you so much for coming out, to our show tonight. We hope you enjoy the very hard work, our young thespians have put into this play, and without further ado, the little stage theater proudly presents, Christmas, what does it mean? - To an outsider, mall town Kansas might not seem to like, the place to find the true Christmas spirit. You'd be more likely fun an abundant of sorghum crop, or a batch of Bessie's famous pepper nut cookies. But the truth is, Christmas is alive and well here. And it is in abundance. This is the story, about a town square Christmas tree. A story about good regular Christian folk. A story about a small town. ♪ Born like any other tree, but given time to go ♪ ♪ I was touched by Jesus Christ, and that began to show ♪ ♪ I got the Christmas spirit inside of me ♪ ♪ From root to stem and stem to leaf ♪ ♪ Today I'm called the small town Christmas tree ♪ ♪ But I don't belong to them and they don't belong to me ♪ ♪ You see, I was here long long ago ♪ ♪ Before settlers changed from towns and roads ♪ ♪ Let me kick y'all back to a time before ♪ ♪ when I was greeted by angels from the Lord ♪ ♪ Don't mean no tents or lie to you ♪ ♪ When Christ was born, I was part of that shit ♪ That was right. ♪ You've been chosen among your kid ♪ ♪ Especially for you to mark a world saved from sin ♪ ♪ Now Christ is gone, mother Mary's given birth ♪ ♪ From around the earth ♪ ♪ Christmas tree ♪ - Wow, a Christmas tree. ♪ I can promise you too ♪ ♪ Here and now ill share God's love whenever I'm firm ♪ ♪ A town will be build around the root ♪ ♪ I'll be here always showing the prove ♪ ♪ The people will come settlers arrived ♪ ♪ Oh God's love giving up his only son ♪ ♪ Celebrate, it's Christmas, Christmas ♪ ♪ I'm a Christmas tree ♪ ♪ I'm here for Kansas ♪ - And thus the young sapling, was made into this small town Christmas tree. Now this town, it went through its own trials, and tribulations, its own histories. Fields were sown, town square was built, houses resurrected, silos and barns popped up like Kansas milkweed, but that's a story for another time. Right now, we're gonna move forward to, a darker time in its history. We're going to move forward to the dust bowl years. It's the height of the great depression. And even then, somehow spirits are still high. It's the 24th of December, the town is just waking up. - Not gonna lie, it lifted my spirits event. It's good to know karma still works. - Bless his heart that had to have hurt, really.

It was a lot louder. - I was really nervous about that big opening dance number, my whole four seconds of it. - Please, alms please, alms for the poor, or ma'am don't you have any coins, for a poor old woman? - Ma'am we don't have any money, Ma'am we don't have any money, Ma'am we don't have any money. Say. - I can't offer you any money ma'am, but we can offer you some breakfast. - I would love that, to warm my poor old, cold old bones. - I like to prepare by really centering myself, in the character 'cause everybody has something in them, that we can relate to, you know? So like my character is poor. - What's all this hoopla about Christmas? I mean What are these foolish people, have to celebrate anyway? Why I can't they let me rest? - Turmeric, egg whites, lemon, apple cider vinegar, and a little dash of honey. Not a lot, start my day with that. And then I just let greatness ensue. Whoa, wow, Okay, but as an actor? - I learned it from my dad. Okay. - My dad died in a fire. - Good morning, sir. I'm glad to see you're awake. The rest of your kin are in the soup line for breakfast. - Soup, for breakfast? - It's all we've got. - Soup for breakfast, nothing for lunch, soup for dinner. - Please try to make the best of it, sir. Where's your Christmas spirit? - Christmas spirit? What a lack. If Jesus wants to save me, he can start by finding me a job. - Jesus does want to save you. - Yeah, Yeah, I heard all about that, every day as a youngling, and I'd never shantytown from here to Hooverville, and Georgia, it's a bunch of a lucky. - It is not, but I'm sure you'll find that out in time. If it's a job you want, I may be able to help you today. - How's that? - Well, fact is there's talk in town, that the tractor factory, is opening back up over in factory town. - Is that right? - That's a fact. And I know where it is. - Why are you so we get to help me? Why do you want to get out of here so bad? - As a volunteer, and a good Christian woman, it's my job to help the less fortunate. So let's get some soup in your belly, and get on the road. - It picks up in the second half. - Boy it sure is a brisk winter's day. It's a good thing there isn't too much snow, it's gonna make traveling easier. - Traveling's never easy, train, horse, a foot, it ain't never easy. - Why can't you ever see the bright side of things? Were you a drinker? - Yes, and I drank, but I never got ill tempered. - Did you gamble? - Yep I did my share of gambling, but I never cheated no one. - Oh the Lord doesn't wanna hear your excuses. And it sounds like your sister in law, didn't either. - Anyway, I can't afford to drink or gamble now, Only thing I've got from those days, is my brother's Bowie knife. Yep, argh, argh. - Oh, it's a lovely blade. - We almost had a props crisis, but fortunately Angelica pulled through, and had a switch blade on her, I mean, what are the odds? - I like to be prepared. - Yup, it's good for skinning a buck, shaving, fishing, or just regular plain eating. At least it was, back when I had some meat at supper time. Ain't much use on soup. - It reminds me of my father's knife. - Oh, my God. Did you. Yes, I called the power company twice, I. - So, how did you find yourself at the church? - Keith. Why aren't you married off? - Oh, - Give me the snow. - Okay. - I had a man once. - So what happened? - Just throw it, come on. - Are you sure-- - That's a story for another day. - Oh. - That's fine, I didn't mean to cry. - Oh boy, it's really starting to come down. - Ain't nothing for it, just kind of keep walking. - Oh, Antonio we're not, we're not dressed for a blizzard. We can't keep going on like this. - We can't go back, it's too far. Maybe there's a farm, if we just keep moving forward. - Woo, oh my feet hurt, it's so cold. - I may have something for them. Will not much, but maybe this'll help. I mean, I'm sorry I'm not prepared it's just, we don't have leather like this down in Georgia. - It's so cold. - But what can we do but keep walking? - We can pray. - Well, as long as you can pray, and keep moving, I'm all for it. - Dear Lord, We are two humble travelers, making our way to a better life, and to continue spreading your word, please on this Holy Yule tide send us help, so that we may spread Christ's love. If we are to die today, we understand that it is in your will. If it is not, please send us a sign, or a savior. - Well, that is a beautiful moment, I will never see again. - Well, that didn't work. Hark, do you hear that? - I can't hear nothing over this confounded, wind and the sound of chattering teeth. - No, hold on stop walking. - No, we can't stop walking. We just gotta keep moving. - Oh gosh, backstage is such a rush, you know? 10 seconds right before you go onstage it's like, it's like that super bowl moment, you know? Oh my goodness, It's like, you know? I'm addicted, okay, I need it. Yeah, you know honestly I want. So I want to know some more thespian life. What's going on here with this? - Wait, are we doing the canter or the Gallop? - We're going full canter baby. - Oh, yes. - Oh, I think out hear it too, where's it coming from? - Oh its coming from the yonder. - Oh, well, hello there. What are you two doing out in this weather? - We are f-f-freezing. - Well, I can see that.

Louis, as part of a Christmas celebration, for him and all the rich folks down there. Well, let me take me old girl out in the snow. But like I said, I'm heading to st. Louis, lucky for you I just so happen to have some warm, fuzzy, hot chocolate in the back. Where are you all going up? - F-f-f-f-actory town, but we can't afford to be picky. - Well, factory town Is just down the road. It's on my way, why don't you hop on in? - We can't say no that. - Its a Christmas miracle. - No, not yet. - It's a Christmas miracle! What do you think about the power of prayer now? - I have to admit, this is a nice surprise. Do you mind if I sat next to you, under one of those blankets? - Oh no, not at all.

Now quick, get out your resume - My what? - Your resume, get it out. - I don't have one. - Oh dear. - Who is there? - It is us, Anastasia and Antonio from small town. We've trudged through the snow to find work. - We don't have any work for you, move along. Wait, let me see your resume. Oh, that is good. As I said, we don't have any vacancies, but if you can scrubs the floors, we can give you three meals, and a cot to sleep on. Now, do you have any references? - You can write my aunt and Cedar Rapids. - Do you have any male references? - Well, my father has passed. - Mm. - Wait, you can write my husband into mine. - Your husband? - That is fine. What about you? Your resume? - You're married? - You can scrub the toilets. - How could you? - Nevermind, we'll take the girl. You can scrub the floors, and the toilets. - No let me in, please. - Antonio I'm so sorry I lied to you, I love you. - Hey let me in, please, what about me? What about me? - Sir there is a church in factory town, I believe they have a shelter. - No, no, Anastasia. Oh, no Am, a, don't make me cry. - Yeah, it's all symbolic, you know? I mean, if you even know what that word means, I understand if you don't, but yeah, this is looking at you baby boomers. - We read the piece of trash that he writes for us. And then we try to find ways, to actually make it function in the 21st century, with dynamic female characters and then Lloyd on it. - Let her out of there. - I'm not keeping her from leaving, do you want to leave? - No. - She doesn't want to leave. - Let me talk to him. - Fine, but just very quickly. - You're married? - Yes, it's a long story-- - I don't have time for long story. Do you want to sweep the floors? The floors are very dirty. - Can he come with me? - No, I don't trust his face. You look confused, should I inform your husband? - If I come with you, will you let me explain myself? - Oh, of course, of course. I'm sorry, I was just surprised. - So you are not staying to scrubs the floors? Well, thank you. This was very productive, good luck in the snow. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. - Well, I guess we should find that church South now. - Women also ran factories in the thirties, just but it's fine. - So, you're not a church volunteer after all? - No, I just had to get out of there. My husband was so beastly to me. And when he was gentle, he was rather dull. - Well, did you try to get a divorce? - Well, our town's pastor was his drinking, and gambling buddy. Once he turned to drink, he used most of our savings for it. I had to savage what little I could. - Oh, you stole that? - Well, I suppose I stole half of it. The other half was already mine. - I doubt he sees it that way. - Well, it doesn't matter. It's only about $200 now anyway. - Well, I don't like being lied to, but perhaps we should keep looking together, for work, just as friends. - I suppose that's agreeable. - Goodnight. - Goodnight, merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. ♪ Merry Christmas what does it mean ♪ ♪ When no one's happy ♪ ♪ and there's nothing to celebrate ♪ ♪ Something you say to strangers on the street ♪ ♪ Flat boards a dinner with much on your plate ♪ ♪ The fire's burning low ♪ ♪ Much slower than before ♪ ♪ Most of my hope escapes a raging fire ♪ ♪ Now only a soft glow ♪ ♪ Merry Christmas what does it mean ♪ ♪ when no one's happy when no one gathers near ♪ ♪ Merry Christmas just memories ♪ ♪ I used to believe that there was nothing to fear ♪ ♪ The fire's burning low much slower than before ♪ ♪ Most of my hope escapes a raging fire ♪ ♪ Now only a soft glow ♪ ♪ Merry Christmas what does it mean ♪ ♪ It's not so simple to love your fellow man ♪ ♪ Merry Christmas worth trying for ♪ ♪ It's not so easy easy to say amen ♪ ♪ Is it really worth trying for ♪ ♪ It's not so simple to know that you can ♪ ♪ Merry Christmas what does it mean ♪ ♪ It must mean something when people still have love ♪ - Henry, what are you doing?

There's a little Shakespeare for you. We are a mighty force, I mean, we may not be the bravest or the strongest or even the most talented, but our little theater had a lot of heart. Why do I think we deserve this grant? Because we are the underdogs you root for him at night. We've got the little thespians who could, we are the misfits who want a hug. We are the no names of Kansas, asking for a name. - It Wasn't perfect, but we did it.

As we all know, Lacey has poured a lot of love, and I think it goes without saying maybe her entire heart, into both the show and this theater. And so I just wanted a really big way of expressing how much I love you and you see God, I'm so nervous. I'm Lacey's boyfriend. And tonight, I would love to be so much more baby-- - Oh for God's sake! - Lacey Francesca, will you please... Keep we can talk about this later and-- - No, I got this, damn, I just wanted to propose. - I know it was really something, but lets get you out of this-- - I didn't know they were dating. - I love Keith, I do. Are you gonna-- - No further comment. How could you do this to me? I mean, we haven't even talked about this. Like I have the grant people with me. - I'm sorry, I just thought maybe it would be like, one of those rom coms you like or something. - This isn't a rom com, this is theater. - So is that, is that a no, yes, no? - I can not talk to you right now. Please, just go. - Lacey, I'm just a tree standing in front of a girl-- - Keith, Keith I'm up for a job in Tampa. - You know I can't go to Tampa, my mom's sick. - Yeah, I know. - Yeah but they ticked all the boxes, even the sorghum production, which very few others have managed to do. - Oh, here she is, the lady of the evening.
