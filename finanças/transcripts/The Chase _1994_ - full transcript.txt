We've been patrolling these newport beach streets together for, what... six years? Six and a half. Six and a half. You know, when people think newport beach they don't think "crime." they think palm trees, the beach. But let me tell ya, we get as much crime here as in any other city. You know, proportionate-wise. Proportionate-wise, obviously. New York’s got, what, 10 million people. Twelve million. Twelve million people. So obviously there's more crime in new york than newport beach. Proportionately. What do you get here? Mostly domestic violence crimes and theft, right? Yeah, we get all that stuff. I see. But we get murder, we get prostitution, we get drugs. We get all that stuff.

We don't wanna get any innocent commuters hurt. We got a sticky situation. This girl's relying on us to rescue her safely. If I let this guy out of my sights, there's a good possibility that we will never see her alive again. If we can get him to a place where there's a minimum of traffic, on a back road or something, we can attempt to shoot out the tires. But the abundance of cars here makes that highly dangerous. Obviously, you always want to keep vehicular intercourse down to a minimum at all times. We don't want this guy spinning out and hitting a busload of nuns or anything. Bet you don't get this every day, huh? Listen, what's the thing you like best about being cops? For me, it's the respect and power that the position commands. I feel like a combination of bruce springsteen and sylvester stallone out there. I don't know whether I ought a be busting' bad guys or signing autographs. Kinda like being a star. I'm gonna throw up. What do you mean? I feel sick. No. Don't you dare. Don't you dare throw up. Breathe. Take in some air. Put your head out the window. Well, don't drive so fast. Don't drive so fast? What are you, mad? I'm being chased by the cops! When you're being chased by cops, you drive fast. Got it? Well, I get carsick! Well, then, put your head out the goddamn window! What are you waiting for? She's got her head out the window! What's she doing? Maybe she's trying to signal us. Can you tell what she's saying? No, I can't make her face out clearly. Oh! She's puking! Aah! - Gross! - Oh, god! - She's puking! - That will never make prime time. That is a lot of puke. I can't see a damn thing. Oh, god. Guess she wasn't signaling us. You okay? no. Do me a favor, will ya. Chew some gum or something. Your breath smells like my grandmother's feet. Where are the other backups? We only got one other car here with us. Unit 39, most units unavailable due to the funeral... of captain Lembeck in long beach. All remaining available units should be en route.

I do not run my division... on a shoot first, ask questions later philosophy! - Excuse me, sir. - Can't you see I'm busy? I think you're gonna want to know about this right away, sir. We just got a positive I.D. on that red BMW. Hold on to your beans, sir. It's registered to a Miss Natalie Nordhoff Voss. She's the young lady hostage, sir. So who's Natalie Nordhoff Voss? Voss, sir, like in dalton voss. No. Not the dalton voss. Are you saying that our hostage belongs to dalton voss? Yes, sir. His one and only daughter. Holy shit! Yes, sir. How many cars in pursuit? Two, sir. Two? There ought a be 20! Why are there only two? Uh, the funeral, sir. A third car is on its way. Three stinking little cars. Where's our chopper? We loaned it to that film company, sir. Well, why the hell did we do that? You approved it, sir. We haven't needed to use the chopper since that marin county brush fire, sir. This is a fine how-do-you-do. Get that chopper back now! Now, who's natalie voss? Only Dalton Voss's daughter. Dalton voss is the donald trump of california. One of the richest men in america. You guys really struck gold tonight, huh? Well, I gotta do what I gotta do. Get down to mexico much? No. Why? 'Cause that's where we're headed. I wasn't planning on company, but... oh, my god! Mexico? Oh, god, just stop the car and let me go! Just let me out! You are really starting to get on my nerves. I'm in a bit of a bind here, so put on your seat belt. We're getting on the freeway. Shit! This is bad! This is really bad! Oh, I can't say the "s" word on tv, can I? It's cool. We'll bleep it. All right, yeah. Why is this so "bad"? Taking the chase on the freeway heightens the stakes. It complicates things greatly. This guy's really pissing me off! Shit. And if you're traveling along the 5 into I.a., there's a slight bottleneck along the john wayne northbound. Yeah, it seems an overturned gravel truck on the shoulder is causing some slowing. Other than that, it's a pretty good commute into the n... whoa! Wait a second! Wait a second! I think we got a situation developing on the southbound lane. Yes, it appears we're picking up a high-speed pursuit. Bill and wendy, do you see this in the studio? Yes, byron, we surely do. It does appear as though we're watching a high-speed chase unfold live. Bill, I'm gonna follow this late-breaking story, see if we can get a little bit closer. Uh, andy, uh, take it down a little bit and see if you can stay with the red car. Three newport beach police cars are taking every precaution... so as not to cause any kind of traffic accident. They seem to be following at a safe distance behind what appears to be... a late-model bmw. Oh, yeah. They're after this guy, all right. He must've done something. Whoa! Ho! Did you see that? Oh, n... watch out. Watch out. Holy mackerel! That medical school truck is spilling out cadavers all along the freeway! That's repugnant! Gross! Aaah! Get it off! Jeez! Get it off! Eeeww! Now, that's disgusting. I'll say. Stay with him, byron. We're going to try to get some more information... from the newport beach police department... on this fast-breaking, exclusive channel 8 high-speed chase in progress. Oh, no! God! Oh, my god! Jesus! What are you trying to do, give me a heart attack? Rule number one is no loud screaming. I thought rule number one was no burning the guy with the gun. You might just be a little too feisty for your own good. Christ. Okay, rule number two is no loud screaming. Stop waving that thing in my face. Am I holding the gun in your face? I don't think so. You know, I can be a pretty likable guy when I'm not pointing a gun at somebody. I know you don't believe me, but it's true. You gotta trust me. Aw, shit! Why do things always go so wrong for me? Maybe you bring it on yourself. -Maybe you don't know what you're talking about! - Maybe I do. - Maybe you're a brat. Maybe I am. Please just stop and let me out. - I promise I won't let them shoot you. - Oh, you won't. That's nice. I appreciate that, but I can't do that. Not yet. So, seeing that we're gonna be traveling companions for a while, I thought we should get better acquainted. My name is jack. And you are? You can't do this. Do what? This! You c... you can't just kidnap somebody and threaten to kill them... and then expect them to be cute and nice. Why not? You just can't. Okay? It doesn't work that way. You are a terrorist. Why should I be nice back to you? All right, first of all, I am not a terrorist. Terrorists have ratty beards and blow up airports. Secondly, there are no rules on how to kidnap people. There's no rule that says you can't be cordial and nice. And quite frankly, for my first time out, I think I'm doing a hell of a job. Now tell me your name! -Only if you get rid of the gun. It scares me. Oh, right. I'll do that, you'll do something stupid, I'll crash the car. - I don't think so. - I'm not gonna do anything stupid. I just... I... I hate guns. There? Are you satisfied? I'm only doing that to ease your mind. Thank you. Now, as I said before, my name is jack. And you are? Natalie. Natalie voss. Natalie voss. That's nice. What, are you related to dalton voss or something? - He's my father. - Yeah, right. Get out. I-it was a joke. I was joking. I wasn't. This is insane. You're Dalton Voss's daughter? The dalton voss? Do you have any idea how goddamn rich that man is? Yes, thank you very much. He is my father, as if you didn't know. As if I didn't know. What? I just... this just... this just sucks! It sucks! Because now they're gonna think I kidnapped you because you're Dalton Voss's daughter. Why me? Why me? I go in for some cigarettes and a tank of gas, and I wind up kidnapping the daughter of dalton voss. - What are the odds? - I would say pretty good. - You were probably stalking me. - Don't flatter yourself, kid. - I was just passing through town. - A likely story. Jesus, you are a brat. This just in from the newport beach police. The owner of the bmw has been identified... as miss natalie voss, daughter of millionaire industrialist dalton voss. Police speculate the gunman followed miss voss... with the intent of kidnapping her for ransom. Well, it certainly is obvious, wendy, that this kidnapping was no happenstance. As you can see, police are taking a more aggressive position, tailing very close behind the bmw. Shit. Mr. voss. Mrs. voss. I want you to know, as far as we can ascertain your daughter is perfectly safe. "Perfectly safe"? She's being held hostage in the middle of a goddamn high-speed chase! How can you say she's perfectly safe? If she were perfectly safe, she'd be at home, locked up, where she belongs! Unharmed, sir, is what I meant. Uh, perfectly unharmed. Our officers are in diligent pursuit. Oh, poor little Nattie in her brand-new car. You look here, boyle. Stop trying to give me this bullshit! It was your incompetent officers that allowed all this to happen in the first place! I want my daughter out of this jeopardy now! I can assure you, mr. Voss, my main concern is your daughter's safety. C.H.P. has been notified and will be providing assistance from... just do your goddamn job the right way for a change. All right? Okay, okay, be cool, jack. Don't panic. Don't panic. Think, think, think, think. Breathe. Things are way out of control! You did not actually kidnap anyone. Oh, well, in case you've forgotten, you kidnapped me! I mean, I didn't intend to kidnap anyone. Pardon me, but is there a difference? Well, of course there's a difference, you moron! Intent means you planned something. I didn't plan anything! Oh, so somebody held a gun to your head and made you hold a gun to my head! In a way, yes. God, it's filthy in here. What's that stink? Step right over here, please. Give it to me quick, patterson. We got a beautiful shot, full on. Right... now. Let's see if I can get closer. Look at his eyes. Chilling. Yeah. So, who in the hell is he? Hammond, jackson davis. 28. "Escaped guards while being transferred from" san francisco county jail to san quentin... "after being sentenced for a 1991 armed bank robbery." hammond? Let me see that. We were notified yesterday he might be headed for mexico. You were notified yesterday and you did nothing? What kind of place is this? Mr. voss, I stress, we were alerted he... he might be headed this way. He could have been headed for vegas or utah just as easily. - we're cops, not mind readers. - Maybe you're not, but I am. And I can see quite clearly you're gonna be looking for a new goddamn job... if one hair on my daughter's head is harmed! Do you hear me? One hair! Get this out in the field. Take his picture off that monitor! I don't wanna see it! Attention, all units in pursuit of red bmw. Kidnapper identified as jackson davis hammond, age 28. Escaped prisoner convicted of armed bank robbery. Shit! Goddamn bastard! He's desperate. This is really bad. Things could get really messy now. An escaped con! This is great! Real-life human drama at its nitty-gritty best. We've been keeping a lookout, but you never know where a creep like this is gonna pop up next. We're going in close on the driver's side! This guy's a lunatic! We'll flank him on the passenger side, squeeze him in. Shit! What? What? This has just gotten way too hairy. What do you mean, "hairy"? I mean hairy! This is too good. Whoa! - holy christ! - Get that! Get that! Oh, my god! Did you see that? Those vehicles tumbled across the freeway like matchbox cars! This is truly dramatic footage! Byron, was that a gunshot we saw come out of the driver's side window? Yes! Yes, that's affirmative, wendy! It appears the assailant shot out the tires on the cop car, causing the catastrophe. This guy must be a sharpshooter to have such impeccable aim at such high speeds. Possibly an ex-marine. Holy shit. Did you see him flip over? I didn't mean to do that. Well, what do you think is gonna happen when you shoot a tire out at 80 miles an hour? I-I don't know. It just went off. I didn't mean to shoot him. What were you gonna do, squirt water at him? Shut up for a minute and let me think! Your voice is cutting through my brain like nails. What's that supposed to mean? What, I have a shrilly voice? Excuse me for not being the perfect hostage. I said shut up! This whole thing has gotten way too violent. I... i h... i hate violence. You hate violence? You are the epitome of violence! You're a gun-wielding, cop-shooting, maniac kidnapper. Now, that's violent. No, I am not! Don't tell me what I am when you don't know a damn thing about me! There is a difference in being violent and being driven to violence! I am not a violent man. God! - Well, then what are you? - I'll make it simple for you. All right? I was convicted of a crime I did not commit. The system does not believe me. Why should I expect you to? That's who I am. You're right. I don't believe you. Well, there you go. What kind of a crime? What is that? What's that noise? The phone. Not a word out of you. What the hell? Press the "send" button. Hello. Jackson hammond? Chief boyle, newport beach. Son, why don't you pull over to the side and let the girl go. What do you say we end this fiasco right now? I promise to help you any way I can. Nothing doing, chief. I don't give a damn about your hollow promises. I've listened to empty hype for two years. For god's sake, hammond! Aren't you in enough trouble? What's this gonna prove? There's no escape. Just let the girl go before she gets hurt. The girl is not gonna get hurt... if you tell your officers to get off my back. - I can't do that. - Get out of my way! Let me talk! - jackson hammond, this is dalton voss. - Daddy, help me! Do something! If you harm my daughter, I'll kill you myself, you stinking son of a bitch! You hear me? Tell him you're fine. Do it. Natalie? I'm fine. There. You hear that? She's fine. Well, dalton voss. This is truly an honor. Okay, hammond, cut the crap. How much do you want? How much what do I want? Money, you asshole. I don't want to pander to you. Just tell me how much you want, and it's yours. That's very kind, mr. Voss, but I'm really not interested in your goddamn money. Of course he's interested in your money. What else could he want? Don't make me lose my patience, hammond. Fifty thousand dollars. Fifty thousand dollars? That's all your daughter's worth to you? You're a billionaire! That's pathetic! All right, fine. A hundred thousand dollars, then? What the hell do you want? An airplane? What? I don't want your money. I don't want your planes. Come on! I didn't just fall off a turnip truck. Must've been a yam wagon. Your pop's got a good sense of humor. Let me talk to my daughter. - Nattie, honey? - I'm here. Your father and I will get you out of this, no matter what it costs. Understand? Be brave, darling. That man isn't trying anything... funny, is he? No, yvonne. He isn't trying anything "funny." natalie, your mother and I... - stepmother! - Natalie, don't start. Well, she isn't my mother, is she? Can we not go through this now? I'm being held hostage in a speeding car. Remember? Don't smart-mouth me. You have put me in a very touchy situation. I'm supposed to be on a plane for Paris, for Christ's sake! Sorry, daddy. I swear, I don't know what's gotten into you. It's been one headache after another. What is your problem? I've tried to give you everything you want. She takes you for granted, dalton. She's spoiled. Hey, hey, hey! What's the matter with you people? Your daughter is going through a crisis right now and does not need to be berated like this! - you listen to me, hammond... - No! You listen to me, Dalt! Who talks to their daughter that way? You ought a be ashamed of yourself. She's obviously fallen into an unfortunate situation here... and could use just a little bit of compassion! You think about it, asshole. No offense, but what a dickhead. Tell me about it. Hammond? Hammond? Goddamn it! As we continue our exclusive channel 8 coverage, looks like help is on the way. Three c.h.p. cars and two c.h.p. cycles... have just joined the newport beach police in pursuit of the bmw. So far this guy has managed to evade... the police's every attempt to put an end... to this heinous, runaway-train scenario. It never ceases to amaze me how many people try and run from the cops. I mean, what are they thinking? Ehh! Hello? I'm gonna outrun a policeman! What's going on in their tiny minds? Do they really think they're gonna get away? Like take this hammond guy. We're gonna nail him! This is a special edition of channel 8 news at 6:00. Tonight, terror on the freeway! Good evening. I'm bill cromwell. If you've just joined us, tonight there's terror on the freeway. As we follow live with exclusive coverage from skycopter 8, a high-speed chase is now in progress. Channel 8 news has learned that Newport beach millionaire Dalton Voss's daughter, natalie voss, is being held hostage by this man, jackson davis hammond. Wendy? Jack? Jackson hammond, also known as the red-nosed robber, was scheduled to begin serving a 25-year prison sentence... for an armed bank robbery in 1991... before he escaped just 24 hours ago. Oh, jack. Sounds pretty serious, bill. How right you are, wendy. Police are mum on Hammond's specific ransom demands, obviously trying to negotiate a safe end... to this horrific saga for miss voss. Jack, you idiot. Look at all those cops. Nobody has ever talked that way to my father before. That's because everybody wants something from him, including you. Me? I don't want anything from my father. Sure, you do. - Like what? - Like love, for instance. Respect. To be treated like a human being, like a woman. Not like some baby girl, which is obviously how he still sees you. Am I right? Maybe. I think I'm right. There's a big responsibility to being Dalton Voss's daughter. I never asked to be born to dalton voss. I just want to be like everybody else. - That's not a hundred percent true. - Yes, it is. You mean, you'd rather be driving around in a primered, used Chevy Nova... than this brand-new bmw? - Get real. - It really wouldn't matter to me. Whatever. It's true. Once you've had money all of your life, it's not that big of a deal anymore. Hey, honey, when you don't have money all your life, it's a very big deal. You guys ever been on a chase this long before? Are you kidding? We go on chases all the time. Never this long though. Not this long, exactly. But yeah, we go on a lot of chases. Do you ever get scared? This... this is off the record, right? Of course. Scared shitless. We're no wimps though. No, I'm not saying we're wimps. It's just that... we're just people, like everybody else. Well, obviously we're people. Standard issue street soldiers. Standard issue street soldiers. That's a great tag line. Thanks. Came up with that myself. So why do you hate your stepmom? What makes you think I do? - Just a hunch. - She's a twit. She obviously married my father for his money, but he's too stupid to notice. She tries to control everything and everybody, but she can't control me. Sounds like chaos. I should have gone away to college. Then I wouldn't have to listen to their bitching. What about your real mom? She lives in I.a. don't tell me. You don't like her either, right? No, I do. It's just that... she'd rather be my best friend than my mom. God, I get so frustrated, I just wanna do something. Like what? I don't know. Something! Something other than what I'm supposed to do. If you look now, you'll see how people are just opening up, allowing this car to pass freely. It's amazing that this far the police haven't been able to stop him. Oh, wonderful. Here comes the circus. What is she doing here? I happen to be the girl's mother, thank you. How's my baby? She seems just fine, mrs. Voss. - We're doing everything we can. - Ha. That's a laugh. What's the matter, dalton? Haven't you been able to buy things right this time? Dalton, don't listen to that. - the truth hurts, doesn't it? - Frances, I am not in the mood. Dalton, you were never in the mood. - I never! - I never did either, married to him. Folks, come on now. I know this tension is unsettling, but please. This bickering amongst yourselves doesn't get us anything. - Hodges, get the Vosses and Mr., uh... - Macenernie. Macenernie some coffee. Yes, sir. Chief, there's a mr. Ari josephson on the phone. He's Hammond's attorney from San Francisco. Why didn't you come get me? This is chief boyle. Talk to me. Chief, this is Ari Josephson. I'm Jackson Hammond's attorney. I just now found out about the predicament my client got into down there. I think I can help. If I could just talk to him, I think I can get him to listen to reason. - He listens to me. - Do what you gotta do. Only get him to let that girl out of the car or Voss'll have all our heads! Chief, I know jackson hammond. The girl is gonna be just fine. This is Corey Steinhoff standing on the shoulder of the southbound lane... of the 5 freeway just past the landview exit. Behind me, traffic appears to be flowing normally. However, in the next few seconds channel 17 hard-core news will bring you... the first live, on-the-ground shots of the hair-raising chase that jackson hammond... here they come. Here they come! Uh, byron, can you get us closer to that bmw? We want to get a glimpse into one of those windows, and maybe we can see if miss voss is tied up... or... or otherwise restrained in any way. Well, as you can see, from the angle that I'm at, it's, uh... it's pretty hard to get a look into the window. I mean, this baby is moving fast! - And natalie voss... - Hey, hey. You're on the radio. Are halfway to tijuana right now in her hijacked bmw. Dalton voss, you will remember, was recently the subject of public outcry... when he decided to tear down 14 blocks of low-income housing in east I. a... to build a mid-city commuter airport. ♪ Macho man ready to get down with anyone he can Hey!

Disappointed? How about destroyed, ari? How about devastated? Jack, this is not the way to beat the system. Screw the system. No, not screw the system. Massage the system, play the system, work the system, but don't screw the system because the system's gonna screw you more. I massaged the system. Didn't I? Huh? Didn't I do everything right? Yeah, you did. Yeah, damn straight I did. Where did it get me? San quentin. - You can't give up now. - What do you want me to do? Sit around and rot for the next 25 years while you come up with a better idea? Wait a minute, ari. Now I'm a kidnapper. I'm probably looking at life. Ah, forget it, pal. This just ain't my year. Look, jack, why don't you just let the girl out? Nobody's gonna hurt you if you just give yourself up. You'll come back, we'll talk, we'll figure something else out. Maybe we can get the public behind you. Public outcry against injustice is a very powerful tool. Oh, yeah, the public's gonna love my ass. The red-nosed robber kidnaps the richest girl in the country. Probably get my own sitcom. Don't underestimate the public. I ain't stopping'. I'm taking this one all the way to Mexico. I'm going Latin, chief. Jack, mexico isn't the answer. You're innocent. We'll get a retrial, get that blood test admissible. You'll eventually get out. So stop, give yourself up before it's too late. Ari, in case I don't get another chance to say this, I just wanted to say thanks for everything. You're really the only honest man I know. You did something nobody else ever did, ari. You believed in me. I really appreciate that. Jack, quit talking crazy. You're talking like it's over. Listen, I still believe in you. I'm still working hard. We can beat this thing together. I can get you out. I'm already out, ari. I'm already out. I don't want my kids to be cops. No, I'm out here every day risking my life so they can have it better than me. I got a kid who wants to be an astronaut. I'd like to keep it that way. Besides, being a cop messes with your head. How so? I mean, every day, day in, day out, you dealing' with the scum of the earth. The only people you come in contact with are dope pushers... and pimps and killers and child molesters. Pretty soon you start thinking that everybody's rotten. Ari, I told you that... Jack Hammond. Jerry Kunkle, channel 9 hard-core news live. While I have you on this channel 9 exclusive interview, let me ask you a question I know is on the minds of all our viewers. Just what do you intend to do when that car runs out of gas? That's the question on the minds of all your viewers? Whether I'll run out of gas or not? Tell you what, Jer. You let your viewers know... that I hope Miss Voss's fear and my desperation... are entertainment enough for them. After all, that's what this is all about, right? What makes for good television? The story as it breaks, live, coming to you from the bad guy himself? I mean, we wouldn't want your viewers to change the fucking channel, would we? What the hell's this world coming to? - Nice. - I'm sorry. I'll buy you a new one. Subject has just passed flower bowl. I'm about 30 yards back. Stay with him. I'm coming on your right. I can't see him. Where is he? He's in front of the pier one truck! All right. We just passed the Flowerbowl. They'll be coming up soon. So just slow down a little, dale. I'm pumped, man. Pumped! Stupid cops. Stupid! Couldn't stop a snail on a salt bed. You see him yet? No, not yet. - When you see him, tell me quick! - I will! - Now... - Yeah? When I give the order, you ram him hard into the guard rail, dale. - That'll stop him. - I'm a road warrior! I know you are, dale. I am. Time to stop those yuppie punks, dale! - Dude, are we gonna be on tv? - You know we are, dude. That's hot. You know we are. Did either of you ever actually kill anybody? Not yet. I did. How did it feel? It didn't feel like I thought it would. It felt shitty. It felt wrong. But what can you do? Partner, there's nothing you could do. That's what I keep telling myself. Of course I'd do it again if I had to. I mean, it's my job. - Hold that thought. I gotta change tapes. - This is great stuff, guys. I mean, really, really, really good stuff. Real true-to-life. I love it. Thanks. Thanks a lot. All right, come on down! Set it right here! That's good! Move, move, move! I want you over there. Hey! Watch it. We're up. Bill, wendy, tom capone standing here at the border between california and tijuana. As you can see behind me, the San Diego P.D. and the C.H.P. are working feverishly... to create an impenetrable wall of force... here at the gateway into mexico... in hopes of stopping this heinous chase from crossing the border. Is such a radical measure safe for the captive miss voss? The San Diego P.D. says yes, the critics say no, but only time will tell. Hello, san diego. Afternoon, newport. What are you doing? I was going to offer you a piece of gum. oh. What'd you think was in there, a knife or something? You could have mace. If I had mace, I would have used it by now. You're not a smart criminal. Thank you. That's what I've been trying to tell you. So are you gonna tell me why you're on the run? You wouldn't believe me. I'm not so sure I believe me anymore. - Try me. - Promise you won't laugh. Why would I laugh? Okay, two years ago, I'm sitting' at home, watching' a ball game. - Dodgers are losing. - I hate the dodgers. - You wanna hear this or not? - I'm sorry. At the same time, on the other side of the city, there's some guy robbing a bank, dressed like a clown. A clown? Yes, a clown. It seems that some jerk had knocked off several banks... in a clown outfit. The media, in all of their originality, picked up on this... and labeled him the red-nosed robber. So I'm coming out of Osco's a couple days later. There's two cops waiting for me. Bang, they haul me in. Why would they haul you in? Let me get to that. I was stuck in sonoma. The only job I could wrangle was playing' a clown at kids' birthday parties, which wasn't such a bad gig. Flexible hours, a lot of free cake. One of my neighbors, some old battle-ax, sees the story on the news. She calls the cops. They get a search warrant, crash down the door, find the costume. - It's all over. - Did you have to wear those big shoes? I knew you'd make fun of me. I'm sorry. I'm not. I'm not. Go on. So ari keeps saying, "don't worry. They don't put innocent people in jail." well, he was obviously wrong because they do. - What are you looking at? - I don't quite picture you as a clown. - So you don't believe me. - I didn't say that. They're here! That's them! - Ram 'em! - Time to be heroes! - Missed 'em! - Hey! Look out! I missed 'em! Adjust, dale! - jack! - What the hell is that guy doing? Okay! I got it! I got it! Back the other way! Whoa! Oh, no! Holy mother of god! You've gotta be kidding me. Oh, my god! Do something! Bill, wendy! Are you seeing this in the studio? Do something! Oh, my god! Astonishing and tragic imagery. A green monster truck, obviously an undercover law enforcement vehicle, made a valiant attempt to sideswipe the bmw, with disastrous results. Almost ready, mr. Josephson. That was a pretty dangerous and radical maneuver from the police, especially with a hostage at risk and that roadblock up ahead. - Wouldn't you say, byron? - Radical? Yes. But I imagine these cops are getting awfully desperate. Three, two. You're on. Randy, thank you very much. This is Paul Dandridge with channel 3's live, on-the-scene, exclusive interview... with Jackson Hammond's attorney, Ari Josephson. Mr. josephson, if mr. Hammond is innocent, why was he found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt by a jury? During the bank robbery, the actual thief cut his hand... on the teller's paper spindle. A sample of that dried blood was taken and tested... and compared with a sample of my client's blood. Jack's blood is type "b" positive. The red-nosed robber's blood is type "a." but because the evidence was collected improperly from the crime scene, it was deemed inadmissible in court. Thank you very much. Let's go back to the studio. Hey! Hey, look at that. You're a folk hero already. I don't care. If you ask me, I think your lawyer's right... you should keep on fighting. Almost sounds like you believe me. You don't strike me as the kind of guy who gives up that easily. What makes you think that? Ah, that. Yeah, that. I'm 28 years old, natalie. I got a lot of good years ahead of me. I'm not going to waste them away in some prison. Yeah, but... yeah, but what? While you're out getting married and taking vacations... and having barbecues in the backyard... and getting all excited about your kid's first tooth, I'll be in a concrete cell surrounded by murderers and rapists... large hairy-backed men who think I have a real cute ass. I am sorry, but it's just not my style. There's got to be something you can do. I mean, if the blood test proves it, why can't you just stand up in court and scream it? This is your life we're talking about. They've got all these little rules and precedents... and procedures and legal loopholes... and all these fancy words and books... all this crap that's more important than a human being. - So that's it? - Just about, yeah. When were you sentenced? Yesterday. - so that's why you ran? - Yep. And that's why you stole the car. Yep. And that's why you freaked out when you saw the cops and grabbed me? You're catching on fast, kid. I don't blame you. I do not know why, but... I believe you, jack. Thanks. That means a lot to me. And so to be able to almost bust someone before they do the crime, you have to be somewhat telepathic. So that's why I see myself as almost a prophet. A street prophet, if you will. I got to change microphones. What? I gotta fix the mike. It'll just take a second. I gotta get that... back off! Back off, will you! That's dangerous! Get-get down, you stupid little nothing! - What is this? - What? I don't believe this. This is Frank Smuntz, channel 12 San Diego evening news, riding in the thick of the police high-speed chase. As you can see, channel 12 is the first newscast to get a close-up look... into the face of this runaway horror. If we're lucky, we're hoping to get a visual conformation on the condition of the hostage. Miss voss! Miss voss! Can you give us a thumbs-up if you're okay? - Right here, pal. - Can we show that on tv? Uh, frank? Frank? Um, it appears we've lost our feed there from Frank Smuntz, riding right alongside that speeding bmw. Lolly. Thanks, steve. I think before we continue we should take a moment to apologize to our viewers... for that obscene gesture you just saw coming from the window of that speeding car. Yes. That's the risk we take with live tv, isn't it, lolly? That's right. We'll be back with more live coverage... of kidnapped at 100 miles per hour... after these messages. Oh, I've had my share of boyfriends. But they've all been losers. You know... boring. They'd have to be. My father had to approve of them all. Old dalt can't be that bad. He must have done something right. Why? Well, look how great you turned out to be. Oh, me? Come on. I'm a total basket case. You don't even know the half of it. No, no. My intuition about people is very good. I could tell right away you had your act together. Yeah? When did you decide that? In the convenience store when we shared that look. Remember? Yeah. Thought to myself only if life were different, maybe I could meet a girl like that someday. Really? Swear to god. Believe it or not, when I was holding the gun to your back, I couldn't help but notice how lovely your hair smelled. - You're crazy. - That would be affirmative. You know, you really hurt me with that gun. You didn't have to jam it into my back so hard. I'm sorry. About the gun, uh... - what? - It makes a handy weapon in a pinch. You kidnapped me with a candy bar? Well, you have to admit it was rather inventive. Oh, god. Don't be upset. If I'd had a real gun, I would have used it. It sure felt like a gun. I thought for sure everybody would hear the wrapper crinkle. Oh, god. I can just see the headline now. Hey. Hey, candy thief. "Kidnapper exposed when candy gun melts in hand." hey! Hey! Come on. Thanks. Thank you. If my father only knew you kidnapped me with a candy bar. Think of the embarrassment. Oh, god, what a jerk. You know, he's probably thinking right now about how he can use all this publicity, 'cause he wants to run for governor of california. Now listen, once this whole fiasco is over, I want you to get me and natalie on a.m. san diego... and all the national morning shows. Call ted turner. Tell him I'll give him an exclusive first once this insane thing is wrapped up, in exchange for some good publicity. He owes me one. Uh, you get to work. I'll call you back. - Mr. Voss? - What is it? Our chopper's back. Well, it's about time. Get me to that barricade. Thanks, rocky. This is paige grunion with channel 17 hard-core news. I am coming to you live on the shoulder of the 5 freeway. And standing here with me are will and dale. They are the drivers of the green monster van. Tell me, gentlemen... monster truck. Monster truck. What possessed you to take such radical and desperate measures... to stop the bmw yourselves? Oh! Dude! We are just doing our duty as americans. Right, will? That's right. And that's not the first time we've had to take matters into our own hands. Mark my words, they'll be pulling over soon. We really scared them. Didn't we? Didn't we? Did you see the look on their faces? Sure did. Whoa! And we'd be happy to tell anyone about it. Anyone. Anytime! On-on oprah. Or geraldo. Or sally jesse. Or any-any... larry king. Larry king. Yeah. Or any of those shows. That's right. And you can usually find us at Big Willy's Dirty Dogs. Most times. My name is will, and this is dale. And we've been through a lot of heavy stuff in that truck before. Monster madness, dude. Major monster madness. Gentlemen, please. What? But-but... we're not fooling around! We're not fooling around! Get in the back. Sometimes you got to take the bull by the horns! We're american citizens! And there you have it. Who says the great american hero is a thing of the past? Back to you, rocky... I hope you can see this, bill and wendy. It's like a circus down there. You know, byron, it's easy for us reporting this story... to forget there's a very scared little girl inside that car. We can only imagine, as this chase continues, the horror young natalie voss is experiencing right now. Oh, shit. Just-just hold still. It stings. Mm! I don't want it to get infected. I'm so sorry about this. As you should be. What are you doing? You're sweating. I've never met anybody quite like you, jack. I wish things were different. I'm really a pretty likable guy when I'm not a fugitive. I wish things were different too. Isn't it funny how people meet? I mean, they can come from two totally different worlds... and never even know each other exists. And then one day they meet and their lives are never the same. Are you married? no. Do you have a girlfriend? No, I don't have a girlfriend. And it's true that... you haven't been with a woman in a couple of years? It's true, yeah. If all this doesn't work out, you'll go back to prison, right? Probably. So it's conceivable that... you'd never be with a woman ever again, right? Right. What are you doing? Falling in love with you. Natalie, you can't... we can't do this. I can't help it. We may never have this chance again. Wait a second.

They'll never be able to get us. I'm your hostage. There's no way they could possibly think we're in this together. It's getting close. It's getting real close.

Take your stinking paws off me, you damn dirty ape! Monkeys. Fix this damn thing. Whoo! Hammond seems to be... bill, wendy, can you see this? Hammond is leading the pursuit in a giant game of ring-around-the-rosy. Jack, you anti-hero, if you're going to get away, get away now. Bill, this is really ridiculous. It's pretty clear now that this guy, jack hammond, is just toying with the police. I hope they put him away for a long time. You are dead serious about going with me? Serious as a heart attack. You are absolutely, positively, 100% sure about this? I have never been more sure about anything in my entire life. We'll be fugitives. Sounds exciting. You won't be natalie voss anymore. Who the hell is she anyway? I don't know. I don't know. But you're going to give up everything for me? Don't flatter yourself. I'm doing it for me too. Of course you are. This is it! Let go of the girl, hammond! What are you doing? Let's keep going. Look, natalie, if I had things my way, you'd be the girl I'd run away to paradise with. But I'm gonna be your hostage. Natalie, it's over. I can't let you ruin your life because of me. I think it's time for you to go home now. You can't mean that. You know, until yesterday... the worst thing I ever did in my whole life was cheat on a biology exam. And now I'm a car thief, a kidnapper, cop-shooter, police-evader. I can't do this to you. I can't make you part of this anymore. I care about you too much. Besides, I can't hold you hostage anymore. We ate the gun. But you have the real gun. Uh... real guns make me nervous. I do better with the candy ones. Jack, you're innocent. We can make this work. You... you're really something. You know that? Thank you. For what? For believing in me. Let the girl go now, hammond! It's been a hell of a ride, huh, kid? What say you, uh, step out of the car and walk away from me? I'll be fine. You come with me. You first. I'm right behind you. Miss voss! Miss voss! Okay, stay down. Oh, you're a lucky girl. You're a lucky girl. Just get behind the door there. Just get right behind the door there. We will take care of him. Don't worry.
