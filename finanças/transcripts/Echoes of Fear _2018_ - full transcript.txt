So, when are you leaving? Next week. I still can't believe he's gone. I know. He was the last one I had. He took care of everything after my mom died. You know your grandfather really loved you, that love doesn't just go away. Here, I want you to take this. Why? You know, it's for protection for the trip. Okay. So, is Brandon driving you down? No, he's swamped at work. He'll come down when he can. Why don't you wait till I can come? I can't. I've got to get it ready to sell before classes start back up. I can't keep it, not with the taxes. Are you sure you'll be okay all alone? I'll be fine. It's just a house. You okay, Twikie? Aww, let's check the place out. Damn it. First thing we need to do is fix these damn stairs. Are you okay? Nearly broke my damn ankle. That thing's a lawsuit waiting to happen. How was the drive? Pain in the ass. It took four hours to get through traffic in San Jose. That's creepy. It was my mom's. Oh. But yeah, it's a little creepy. It's too small. I'll see if I can find another one. Hello! Hello, hi! - Hi! - Hi. I'm David. - Alysa. - Oh. You're the new neighbor, huh? For a bit. We're selling it. Oh, well, you shouldn't have any problem. It's top of the hill, dead end street. Jimmy was real lucky to get it, yeah. Did you know him? He was my grandfather. Oh, well, I'm so sorry for your loss, yeah. You know, I don't recall ever seein' you around. He liked to come up and see me. Were you friends? As well as anyone in the neighborhood, I suppose, yeah. Alysa! I should get back to it. Oh, okay. It was good to meet you. - Nice meeting you. - Yeah. You all be careful in this heat, yeah. Do you know that this place has two addresses? Highland Park in the front and Eagle Rock in the back? I don't know why your grandfather would've closed off the front. Highland Park is so much hotter than Eagle Rock right now. I was thinking of giving half of the money from the sale to some of my grandfather's charities. You don't have to do that. If your grandfather wanted them to have half, he would have set it up. But he wanted you to have it. It's up to you, but, you're gonna need the money, like, to replace that clunker that can't make its way down here. Yeah. You shouldn't make snap decisions. I'll see you next weekend. It'll be here before you know it. Drive safe. And the snake wriggling down the rabbit hole. Hmm, well we're not gonna be able to get it done from here. We'll have to go under the house, find the main pipe. We'll get her cleared for ya. Here we go. And we got a winner. Stuff travels down and bunches up at a joist, sharp turn like right here? Now, we just get her in there. When we hit the blockage, we'll know. Bingo. There's your culprit right there. Stuff like that builds up over time. Let's get some more. Oh, there she blows. Okay, can you get a bucket? Yeah, I'll get it. You're gonna need that. Come on, you fucker, get out. You already done? Ah, I got an emergency call. You'll just have to put it back together. What do I owe you? Don't worry about it. Is everything all right? I'm fine, it's just... Creepy as hell being in that house alone? I gotcha. How 'bout next week? That'll be great. Can you come by when Brandon's not here during the week? And miss his smiling face? Steph! Okay, next week, girls' night. Great. - How are ya? - I'm good. Moved into the neighborhood. We're lookin' to flip the place, so. - This your place here? - Yeah. - Nice. - If ya know anybody. Hey, you should put those up for tonight when everyone comes over. Everyone? Neighbors? Your housewarming party? You're selling it? Yeah, but we would entertain some offers if you wanted to avoid an agent commission. There's plenty of room by the fire. Oh, yeah well, I best not. Oh, I was curious, do you know why your grandfather died? It was a heart attack. Jimmy's heart gave out because he stopped doin' what he loved. Ya see, there's a reason why all of us have been put here on this crazy planet. The first step is findin' out what that reason is. And the second step, well, is embracing it. Oh, and you never stop doin' it. Ya see, retirement, oh, retirement is death. Don't forget that, yeah. Well, with that said, I think it's time for me to go and retire. Yeah. Do you need help? No, no, I got it. Just slow and steady. 'Night. - We're selling everything. - Oh. Let us know if you're interested. Yeah, neighbors first. What's goin' on? Did you see it? See what? I don't know, someone in the room. There's no one else here. What'd you see? The curtain, it, it... It what? It went around me, I felt it. It's the wind. Come back to bed. I'm headed out early. You're leaving already? I'm moving our stuff into storage. What? I was able to get us out of our lease and I'm gonna crash with Jeremy to save us some cash. I'm thinkin' we sell this place, take the money, find a place of our own, kickstart our life together. I'm hoping that we can get this place ready by next week and get it on the market. See ya. This place is great. I love the high ceilings. Wow, he gave all of this to you. Yeah. Good God. He was a pack rat. More like a closet hoarder. There might be something down here. This should be a match. Spill it, what'd you hear? Come on, you're all alone. The house is gonna make noises, right? Probably lots of creaks and pops. Yeah, and a meowing cat. Your grandfather had a cat? Never. I think he was allergic. Maybe it was a stray. What? There's something up here. The bulb was just loose. Yeah, I'd say you've got a squatter. A squatter? Well, the place was abandoned for a bit, right? You probably scared him off, or maybe there's something else here. Do you believe in ghosts? Sometimes, late at night when I'm by myself. But I definitely believe in bad karmic energy, and that we can fix. What does that do? Cleanses the house. How long was it before they found him? A couple of weeks. I had the police check on him. Did he have heart problems? No, but he had a brain tumor. You never told me that. I didn't know, not until I found the medication for it. He was already dying. He had six months to live at most. But they're sure it was a heart attack? I confirmed it. I think he may have overexerted himself. I think they were the last things he wore. Maybe he was digging for something. The pipe was clogged with long black hair. There ya go. I just got here and within a week my hair clogs the pipes? Oh, okay, that's weird. There should be some of it around here somewhere. Wait here. What if he wasn't working in the yard, but here. It's the same dirt. What's wrong? You saw something? What? Like a shadow, and I felt something. Do you think he was trying to find something buried here? Maybe. Maybe he found it. We've gotta sleep in here tonight. Why? The answer will come to you, whatever it is. You are your grandfather's blood. It's in your veins. You have to confront this head on and I wanna help. Well, if he had a squatter, he's gone now. You found it in the attic? It was my mom's. My grandfather tried to save as much of my family's things as he could. Maybe it's your mom. What? The ghost. - Steph. - No, seriously. Maybe your mom is trying to reach out to you. Maybe you're supposed to find this or something else of hers here, something she wants you to have. Have you had any dreams? Unusual dreams. The only dream I remember is someone walking down the hall carrying a bag with a silver medallion on it. What happened? Nothing, I woke up. The photo, is that your grandfather? I don't know, he's so young. Steph, Steph. Wake up. Wake up. Wake up. What? I'm afraid we closed up the house too well last night. I think the paint fumes got to us both. Or the house cleansing. The photo? Where's the photo? I don't know. What's wrong? You're sure it wasn't a dream? I'm sure I got up. Something was there. You think it's in my head. Just 'cause it's in your head doesn't make it not real. That's where all reality is. Nothing's real until it's processed up here. If a ghost is tryin' to reach you, that's where they'll have to do it. I just don't know what to do until the weekend. First off, change all the locks. There was a squatter. You may have already run him off, but maybe not. And if it's not a squatter? Then it's a ghost, either out here or in your head. There ya go, all set. I'm just a phone call away. And I'm keeping a set of keys. You better call me. I will. It's just you and me, Twikie. I hope. Maybe you're imagining things. I've never seen anything in the house. You've barely been there. I know you feel guilty about your grandfather and the house, but he's dead. You shouldn't feel that way. You don't owe him anything. I owe him everything. You're just talking money. That was love, his love. I need you down here. I'll be there in a couple of days. Just sleep there tonight. You can go back to the house tomorrow when it's daylight. I'm not going back. You have to. Asshole. "I'm hearing things, seeing things. "As a doctor, I know that the tumor is causing "auditory and visual hallucinations, but it feels real. "Is it guilt for failing my sin? "My only solace is Alysa. "She knows my love and will remember me, "for all my fails and faults. "She is my legacy." I don't have a choice. I have to go back, find something. What? What happened to my grandfather. Find what he was trying to find, what happened there. He saw something, I know he did, like I did. It terrified him and caused his heart attack. You need to go somewhere safe. There's nowhere safe, not till I finish it, find it. Listen to me, you don't have to do anything. It's up to me or he won't be at rest. Basement. Stop! The voices in the house, it's in the pipes. It's in you. They're in you. Are you okay? Did you see him? See who? A man, he was hiding below the house. No, I didn't see anyone. My grandfather blocked off the front of the house, the garage. Why would he do that? I don't know, huh. Maybe there was someone on the street he was afraid of, he didn't like. He never talked to me about it. Are you okay? I'm fine! The squatter's still there? No, I ran him off. You can't stay there. I have to, I'm close. I know it, it's her. If I could find out a name or a date. I have to figure it out. Then I'm coming down. Stay in the house and keep the doors locked. Okay. "I can't escape the past. "Like the tumor, I wish there was a way to cut it out, "remove it completely, but it lingers hidden inside. "The only thing I fear is for Alysa. "The connection still exists. "She must sell this cursed home." Steph! Oh God. I'm sorry, I called. It went right to voicemail. I have to show you something. Are you all right? That's her? I'm sure of it. I found all this stuff in the crawlspace. This is what I saw. It wasn't a face, but a mask. And these were with it. What? It's nail polish. Bring all the bottles. It's the same. They're all from these bottles. It matches. Whatever all this is, it's way beyond ghosts. You have to come... - Shh! - What? It's the pipes. Let her out. That's where I found the mask and nail polish. There's nothing else down there. There has to be. What? We need a hammer. Wait, I see something. Gimme a boost. Lantern! What's in there? A suitcase. I don't understand. It's the same bag from my dream. How's that possible? Maybe it wasn't a dream. Maybe your grandfather was searching for something in here. It's solid rock. I don't get it. Maybe it was the bag it wanted you to find. You gotta be kidding me. My grandfather wasn't trying to find something when he died. He was tryin' to hide something. Oh. It's all rock. The house is built right on top of it. We've gotta be right below the master bathroom. That's the bathtub. Be careful. What is it? A dead cat. Shit. Why would he keep a dead cat? Why would he hide it like this? It doesn't make any sense. Let's get out of here. Watch out. I'm okay. How many cats did he kill? How could he? Steph! You can take off the mask, David. Our phones, you were jamming them. That mask, you're hiding behind it. No, that is the mask of sanity that I wear every day. The kindly old sick man. No, this mask is who I am. You killed them with my grandfather. He was my cousin. Oh, he was so clever, ever since childhood. He was my mentor. When the lot became available nextdoor, why, I designed him the perfect house. We became the perfect team till you grew up. Yes, he stopped because of you. When you grew up to be his pretty little girl. He loved me. He never loved you. He just fell in love with how you saw him. That's all he cared about when he was dying, how you would remember him, his legacy as a kind old man, a legacy of lies. I just didn't know where he kept all of his trophies, all that residual DNA. I need to thank you for uncovering them, forcing me out of retirement. Breathe, breathe. Breathe it, breathe it. Breathe. That's not how it's going to end. There's a way that it is done, a proper way that it's done. Together, Jimmy and I, we perfected the steps. In the beginning, it was always over too fast. And then we learned how to make it last. Aren't you missing a step? You're supposed to fuck her. What's the matter, you limp dick? Why don't you come over here and try to fuck me if you can. If you're man enough. What's your problem? Can't get it up without my grandfather around to give you a hand? Is that what you want, bitch? Breathe it. Aw, hell, Jimmy and I always knew how to deal with bitches like you. Alysa? Alysa, open the door. I'm sorry. Alysa. Alysa! (phone ringing through call box Alysa? Alysa. Hello? Is everything okay? Is everything all right? What the hell are you doin' here? Oh. I, I heard glass breaking, yeah. Where's Alysa? Oh, I don't know. I... I heard a commotion. I just came over to check on her, yeah. When was the last time you've seen her? Brandon. I don't know. A day or two ago, I think. Brandon watch out. I was worried about her, yeah. Worried? Yeah, yeah, she was actin' bizarre. Yeah, she said somethin' about wantin' to tear down a wall. Yeah, you haven't seen anything like that, have you? Yeah, she actually tore down a wall in here and then... No! No. No. You fucked this all up again, just like you did before! This bitch is the last one that Jimmy and I killed. It should have never ended with her. And it won't, not with her, not with you. Alysa. Alysa. Hold on, you're gonna be okay. Be careful. He's not getting up. So, I guess your house is no longer a crime scene. Yeah, took a while. I hired someone to clean it up and sell it. My share's gonna go to the girls' families. after they identify who they all are. Won't bring them back. I know. No good can come of that house. Something good did. My grandfather died there.
