Ouch. The animal is dangerous, huh? You catch them? Yes, Miss. - Close to here? The palangre, out there, on the other sea, they live, okay? Oh. - Okay. Are these the kind that attack people? No, the tiger shark gets mad. What do you sell 'em for? For eat. You mean you eat shark meat in the island? No, no, no, the shark the preparation. In Mexico they say it as... Which is the most dangerous kind? The one that bit you now, there's the tintorera. Tintorera, the Americans like you say, tiger shark. Tiger shark? - See you later. See you later. - Bye, adios. Put him in the main cabin, can't you see he's alone? In the main? Do you want something? Yes, whiskey. No, whiskey, no. What then? Sorry, there is nothing aboard, nothing, not even coffee but whatever you like, I go and buy. Patron, can I take the motor boat? Why? Because in the morning I come to go to the reef to pick up the sharks from the trap. Okay, you can take the boat but I want to see the sharks. You want to come along? This is my trap. Many people hunt sharks on the island? Only me and my brother but we only work in the season. The rest prefer different fishing, make more money. You're saying there are more sharks during a certain season. Yes, when the saris come in, the sharks will follow. Will you help me with this? What can I do? Help me pull up this line. The first one is coming up. It's dead but to make sure, I hit him on the head. Let's get the other line now. What happened? A big shark must've taken a bite. Tintorera struck us, only one bite and she got more than half. But tonight we'll trap her and tomorrow we get that bitch. Look what happened. I told you, it ate more than half. Maybe you hate them, but I feel sorry for them. But then that's life. Actually I'd rather hunt the tintorera in bikini that walks along the beach. The manager of the hotel extends his cordial welcome and wants to buy you a drink. What would you like? Vodka tonic, gin and tonic, rum and Coke, bloody Mary, daiquiris, zazi, lemon viraco. What's a xaxi? It's a Mayan word for scotch on the rocks. I think I'll have a vodka tonic. Vodka tonic. - Thank you. You're the manager of the hotel? Just a simple guest enjoying the scenery. Tonight I'm having a special dinner. Island lobster and French champagne. Would you care to join me? Who's the dinner for?

He said he wants to catch a shark. But they have gone up so much that they grabbed him and they started prying and prying and pulling him from his arm, from his head, from everywhere and we're prying and prying, he flew all the way. Good morning, Patricia. Hello, do you know Miguel? Miguel, this is Steven. You know, Miguel was just telling me about this wonderful fisherman, what was his name? Yeah, the name was El Venado. El Venado. - You know, when he died, this island lost... - Did you sleep last night? What? Did you sleep well last night? Yes, I did, go on, tell me how he died. Well, he died when a big whale came... You woke up early this morning. Yes, I got up early. Look, pretty boy. What happened to your friend? He's so aggressive. What's the matter with you, you stupid idiot? You have to use your fists? Stupid idiot. Can't see a thing. In my eye, right there. I can get 3.25 for a kilo of meat. And for the skin, gets 3.40 and seven pesos a kilo for the fins. Would you like to be a farmer? No way. Why not? Because it is hard and difficult work and besides they always have problems. It rains too much, it rains too little, really, I'd rather be a fisherman. The sea, it doesn't give too much but it always gives. Have you been to Mexico? No, never. Would you like to go? What would I do in Mexico City? Besides you are here because you need the rest. Just like everyone else who comes here looking for beach, air, sun. Since I was a child, I had all this. You know, we had a beautiful romance. Well, things get complicated when you start to feel something for somebody. And I think I was falling in love with him. And I think he felt the same. Well, I don't feel like spending the whole night listening to you talking about your brave Don Juan. So I think that maybe I better go on and bring him back to you. Then I'll have a chance to get him back. No, sit down, sit down. You're wonderful and I don't want any complications, that's why I'm here. Anyway, soon I'll have to ﬂy away and go back to my nest. Well, then... In the meantime, let's dance. Okay. ♪ Doesn't anybody want to join me ♪ ♪ Dance disco girl whoo hoo ♪ ♪ Doesn't anybody want to join me ♪ ♪ Dance disco girl shoop shoop ♪ ♪ Doesn't anybody want to ♪ Watch out, the wild man has arrived! You want to fight? Let's go to the sand and tangle out there or just go there and join the party. You always go around playing the part of a clown? I'm just a happy go lucky guy. Go on, sit down. There are plenty of girls here for both of us. Girls, this is my best friend. This is... Steven. Steve, Steve and I are very, very good friends but it happens that we have a different temperament. This is Kelly. - Hi. And this is Cynthia. - Hello. What's the matter? You seem upset. I'm not upset. Miguel. - Miguel. Right. - Right. Listen, we'll see you tonight, okay? Okay- Goodbye. - Bye. Bye, I'll bring Steve along, huh? Great. Patricia's not here. I'm not interested. You know, she was really crazy about you. I told you I'm not interested. You really behaved like an idiot with her. She made me feel like a damn fool. Well, I didn't make an impression. She took off, can you imagine? I had to pay the bill, me. I think she found a guy from her own country, maybe a rich one. She didn't make love to me. She was thinking of you. Twice she called me Steve. You're trying to make me feel good. So what if I am? It's a fact. But don't worry, I'll get even with you one of these days, you'll see. She was a strange girl. She wanted no involvement and ties of any kind here. I could kill you. Can you imagine? - Yes, truly. How horrible, look. Hey, where do you live? There. The boat. - So that's your ﬂoating hideaway, huh? Ooh, can we go? - Sure, it's ours. We'll take the rubber boat. No, I have a better idea. I think we should swim to the boat. Yeah, let's go swimming. That's the best idea you girls had so far this evening. . Whoo! Come on. Come you chicken! Come on, Steve, come on in, whee! You're gonna miss out, viejo! Come on. - Come on, come on, get in the water. ♪ Giving it everything ♪ ♪ Giving it every little thing I got ♪ ♪ Yes I'm giving it everything ♪ ♪ Giving it now I'll give it ♪ ♪I'll give it♪ ♪ I'm giving it ♪ ♪ Yes I am I'm giving it ♪ ♪ I'm giving it ♪ ♪ Giving it everything ♪ Let me have Steve now, you go with Miguel, he's fabulous. Bye. Hello, hello, sleepy head. BYE- — Bye bye. Come on, Cynthia. Let's go. - I'm coming. Miguel, what do you do for a living? I just live. How, from what? My body. Don't tell me you take money from women. Sometimes, yes, sometimes I pay. I tip, that's how it goes. But once in a while I get really involved, viejo and I pay through the nose, man. But naturally I try to avoid that. My hunting grounds are Acapulco, Vallarta, Xiuatanejo, all the Pacific Coast. Where the money is. ls that all you want to do? No, first I'm gonna get my clothes at the beach. Yeah but what about your future? My future. My future can wait until I get my clothes over there. How about a little bet? I bet you I can get to the beach before you do. Okay- What do you want to bet? I bet you the two girls. If you win, I give them both to you. And if I lose? Well then we'll both enjoy them. But you pay all the expenses as usual. It's a deal. - It's a deal, okay. On the count of three. One, two, three! You have your fins on. What fins? Those are duck feet you have on. All right, let's call it a tie. No, no, no, you're the winner, fair is fair. I'm drowning. - Come on, now, come on. Okay, come on, nobody with your big tits will have ever drown. - But I was so scared. No, open your mouth, that's it. Come on, come on. There you are, there you are, that's it. Viejo, how's life treating you, huh? Well, I can't complain. - Hey. Hey, I have an idea. There are all kinds of lux fish here. Groupers, yellowtails, hammer jacks, good to practice on. I bet I can catch the largest fish. What's that cartridge for? It's a surprise. When we are down below you better stay close to me. The current's strong, you'll see. Okay, now you're gonna be a great shark hunter. What do you want me to do? Just watch me and learn. This is like parachuting, the first mistake is your last. Remember, the sharks always go after the wounded animal. What should I do then? The ones you have to worry about are the tiger sharks, the black nosed ones. Are those dangerous? Now you have got only one chance. You have to hit exactly in between the eyes. And then you pull. Okay? You act quickly, viejo. What? - I said you act quick. Yeah. - That shot was effective. This is just the beginning, tomorrow, tomorrow the real hunt starts. Where are we going? We're going to the cave, to the cave. That's where the big ones are. Hello, beautiful lady. Are you waiting for some gentleman? Yes, I was, for one. Seems to me that two have arrived. I hope you don't mind if we sit with you, I know you don't. I just know. It seems you already have. Right. - Would you like a drink? Yes, tequila. My name is Miguel and he's Steve. Hello, Miguel, Steve, I'm Gabriella. Gabriella and tell me Gabriella, where did your parents have the beautiful idea of having you? In beautiful England. I love English ladies. Gabriella, what are you doing here? Looking. - Looking for excitement? - For fun. Fun is excitement too. Are you Mexican? We're both Mexicans. What do you do? We're shark hunters. ♪ I know I'll never find another you ♪ ♪ No one could love me half as much as you do ♪ ♪When you comin‘ home when you comin‘ home ♪ Mr. Shark Hunter. May I have the pleasure? ♪When you comin‘ home when you comin‘ home ♪‘ ♪ I see us walkin' ♪ ♪ We're walking hand in hand with my baby ♪ ♪ When I wake up ♪ ♪ I find your pillow empty in bed ♪ Ah, sweetie. You're crazy. Good morning. Are you gonna make us breakfast? What do you want, my love? Boiled eggs, fried eggs? Champagne, caviar? Scrambled eggs, please. Me too. An omelet for three. That's correct. Hey, come on, wake up, sleepy head. Let's go swimming, come on. Oh, no! Put me down, put me down, put me down! No, no, no, stop, stop! The natives are nervous tonight. You came in. - You're a chicken. Musketeers. I've been thinking about our relationship. I feel there should be an agreement, some rules. That's good, let us have some rules. What kind of rules? Well, number one. At no time, if any of us get jealous, no jealousy at any time. I'll drink to that. Me too. And number two. There should be no other women because I'm enough for both of you. Absolutely. " Yes? And lastly, most important of all, if there's any indication of love at any time, of any type, then the triangle is dissolved, terminated. Nobody falls in love. - Nobody falls in love. Right. - Right? Right. Musketeers. One for two. And two. For one. Hold onto this and don't let it go while you are in the water or you will end up in Cuba. Okay, it's over there. All right, what are you going to do? You'll see, take your visor. I don't believe you do this for a living. Good shot, Miguel. You must be sick in the head! Now it's my turn. - You're absolutely crazy! Here take this. You're crazy! A tiger shark, let's go to the boat. What happened? What happened? A tiger shark. You don't play around with that kind of animals. If you'd have had harpoon ready, you would've had a great shot. It's not true. You don't kill that animal just like that. You have only one shot, if you missed, you're lost. Oh, I couldn't believe you two today. That's nothing. When I say you're crazy, I mean, it. You wait until tomorrow. Doesn't this seem much more fun? So beautiful out here. And there are none of your playmates who I think are highly dangerous. I mean, I understand the challenge, sort of. But couldn't you do without it? Well, for one thing, I don't think my heart could stand it again. And I'd like to think that this relationship will last for a while. It will, it will. And I want you to know. I'm very surprised we're all coming home together. I'm worried about how this is going to end. I know it must end one of these days. It's been an incredible experience, really. I'm beginning to feel afraid of it. You're a worrier, don't think about the end. Don't limit yourself. Are you falling in love with Gabriella? What, you want it to be secure? If you like, I could leave, you might have a future with Gabriella. No, don't be a fool. You know what I mean. I just like it the way we are. Right. Then shut up and enjoy it. I guess you're right, I won't think about it. Good then I don't want to hear another word about the future, tomorrow or any other shit. All right, it's a deal, I won't say another word. Okay, let's forget it. Here we go. You know what? You came here for a change and we started out as rivals. But we're friends now. We're friends because we taught you how to enjoy life. As I'm doing it, while it's still a life. You seem to have the world in your hands. That's right. To enjoy life has been my goal. And, viejo, remember me that way. If I die tomorrow, you have a party for me. Thanks. Laugh and dance with women and song. I'll throw the biggest party you ever saw. I've had everything in my life. Never enjoyed anything, you know? You are making quite a big progress. I'm really proud of you. I understand what you're saying. And I'm starting to think that way. That's one thing I owe you. See, I'm a good teacher. Hello. - Wow. What did you do? I just got dressed up for a change. Let me see. As far as I'm concerned, you could always be undressed. Miguel gets carried away. Why, don't you like me dressed? I like you anyway you are. Gabriella, don't you ever think this will end someday? When it comes, not now. What about the future? I don't think about the future. I only think about today And today is full of love and happiness. I have one love divided into two. It's true, one love is for you. And the other part is for Miguel. Hey- To us. To our anniversary. Anniversary? - Sure, viejo. It's a month since we met and three weeks since we got married. That's right. - Really? I have a special present I bought for all three of us. Give me your finger. One. And two. And the little one for me. ♪ Take me ♪ ♪ Where our world is one ♪ ♪ Warm me ♪ You go first.

What do we do if a tintorera appears? We got to get out of the water. Besides, I don't think he would come back. Those monsters are always on the move. Except when they are eating human ﬂesh, then they come back. Barn. Steven, Steven, Steven! He killed him, he killed him! He killed him. I'm leaving this afternoon, Steven. Can we go somewhere else and try to forget? The memory of Miguel is never gonna leave us. I'm sorry. We are going to catch it. My men are doing their best to cooperate all they can with the fishermen. Because it's going to take everyone's ability to trap it. Look, there goes one, there. Let me take a shot at that monster. It's not the tinto but let's kill it. Let's kill it now! Caught another one. - Help me pull him up. It's not the one I want, I'm gonna kill him anyway. Stop it. I hate these bastards. Caught so many sharks by now that the big tintorera must be dead. To enjoy life has been my goal. And, viejo, you remember me that way. If I die tomorrow, have a party for me. Laugh, dance with women and song. Laugh, dance with women and song. Do you have a table anywhere? In a minute. - Thank you. Hello, do you think we could join you? Of course. Hello. - Hi. Thank you. I'm starved. Me too. What do you recommend? Depends on the way you feel. We're really hungry. Something that fills up your stomach. Of course, we have the best. Hello. - Hello. We're having a party tonight at the Amaca Hilton. You are invited. You can come too, friend. There we don't dislike anybody, amigo. Every night we have the best parties in the island. Tonight it's at the Amaca Hilton. Welcome home. Please make yourselves comfortable, whatever you want. El viejo, Steve, welcome home! Steve. Steve. Nothing makes me happier than getting an old friend back from my past, Steve. What is this? Nectar of the gods, drink and don't ask. Drink. Whoo, dynamite. It is. What is it? - Well, if you insist. It's a little tequila, little coconut juice and a little rum. And a little green tea for rheumatism. It was the favorite drink of Emperor Montezuma. What a mixture. It's an aphrodisiac. You'll need it later. Remember, there are two of us. And Mike, we're sorry. Let's not speak about it. Don't be sad, viejo. We're not going to share you tonight. We'll all go to my yacht tonight. It's a special party, the best you've ever been to. We'll take the rubber boat. No, let's take the boat. Hey, I got this great idea. Why doesn't everybody just take off their clothes? We'll go swimming! Bet you're tired. Oh! MY hair! Whee! The boat's over there. Get out of the water! Everybody out of the water! Why? - Oh, clear God, forgive us. Mr. Madison? - Yes. You're the man that called me? Yes, I'm Steve, do you have any luggage? I can't tell you how sorry I am. The accident happened here. Why weren't the beaches closed? Why were you all in the water if there was a killer around? Have they caught the shark yet? Not yet, all our efforts have been useless. It's still being hunted, it won't be long. How are they trying to catch it? There are hooks laid along the whole beach. They say that an incensed shark returns always to the scene of an attack sooner or later. When it comes back, I'll be waiting. 10 years ago, the mother of my daughter died. I didn't look after her, she left me and I lost her. Now I want her back. I wanna see Kelly Papa? - It's all right, baby. It was awful. It's all right, it's all right. I'm gonna take you home. Away from this nightmare. - Daddy, help me. These people, they can't do anything right. Okay, here are the new things, I hope they're what you want. . They came looking for you, they're gathering all the fishermen. Oh, there was another attack on the beach. Yes, I heard already, what a tragedy. It must be the tintorera. I have no doubt about it. Well, I'm leaving, I'm going to see the capitan. I'm going down alone tonight. If you go down there tonight, you are a dead man. You are crazy! - I'm going to kill it. Just watch me and learn. Your first mistake is your last. Remember, the sharks always go after the wounded animal. The first mistake is your last. One chance between the eyes. Got only one chance. You have to hit exactly in between the eyes. Exactly in between the eyes. ♪ Take me ♪ ♪ Where our world is one ♪ ♪ We'll always be ♪ ♪ Be a part of one ♪ ♪ Sharing ♪ ♪ Love forever young ♪ ♪ Together ♪ ♪ To the setting sun ♪ ♪ We'll drift on dreams that danced by ♪ ♪ We'll face the world with a sigh ♪ ♪ We'll be together ♪ ♪ Together until we part ♪ ♪ Together until we part ♪ ♪ Heal me ♪ ♪ With the love I need ♪ ♪ Caress me ♪ ♪ Like a summer's breeze ♪ ♪ Don't leave me ♪ ♪ With just memories ♪ ♪ Memories of dreams that once danced by ♪ ♪ Memories of love with no disguise ♪ ♪ Memories of just our moment together ♪ ♪ Take me ♪ ♪ Memories of just our moment together ♪ ♪ Until ♪ ♪ Goodbye ♪ ♪ Until goodbye ♪ ♪ Until goodbye ♪
