Seeing you suddenly, brought back old memories. Please, let it go. No. I'll never let it go. Let it go, Mom. Cheol-su is not a bad person. He's handsome and dashing. He may act strange at times, but it's not every day. He's righteous. I don't want to hear it. How could you leave me like that? I couldn't admit I was pregnant with Saet-byeol then. I had no choice but to move here with him. I'm scared, Mom. Can you help me when the baby is born? Please come? I'll make sure Cheol-su apologizes. DAEGU POLICE STATION When will you smarten up!

She can't bleed. But... Tight... Excuse me. Don't move, okay? Ready? No one in the family is a match for the transplant. It's best to find a matching donor as soon as possible. Where can we find someone like that? What's taking Saet-byeol so long? It's time to sleep. Do you know why she's not coming? Examinations take a while. - Examination? - Yes. She's sick. She should sleep. Excuse me. What... What examination is she having? She should be sleeping now. Well... - What examination is she having? - I'm sorry. Too many examinations can hurt. She needs rest.

Saet-byeol, I'm sorry. - Saet-byeol? - Turn it. Okay. Saet-byeol? I'm so sorry. I should have opened the can for you. You can't bleed. I'm sorry. It's okay. I'm all better now. Really? Wait! You can't go inside. Why? But Saet-byeol's finger… Let's just wait until Saet-byeol is all better. Then I'll give her blood now. The doctor said Saet-byeol can't take your blood. When we find someone else's blood, she'll come out. Don't worry. Okay? Why? Is it because I'm dumb? No, of course not. What are you... Stop it! Please! It's hard on me, too. What's wrong with him? I'm scared. Yeong-su... Why am I stupid? Saet-byeol, it's okay. I'll be back. - I'll talk to him. - But... Cheol-su? For such a big guy, you're so soft-hearted. What will you do when Saet-byeol gets married? Let's go. You have to be strong to protect her to the end. I just realized I haven't bought my son-in-law a good meal. Anything you want to eat? I know a good place. Flour is bad for you, but our noodles are yummy. Hi! Saet-byeol gets special treatment! The bed looks totally cool! Move over! Saet-byeol see these and cheer up! Saet-byeol. Hang in there. I'll buy you the coolest gift for your next birthday! What are you doing? Try it, mister. It's totally fun! Wow! Cool! There's a pig! Sir! Who are you? Do you remember me? No. You can't come in here, people. I'm sorry, sir. About what? Mr. Lee? Do you remember me? No. - Who are you, mister? - I'm sorry. About what? Let go. What are you doing? We saw the news. Mr. Lee saved all of us. Thank you. Thank you very much. I quit drinking cold turkey to give the kid clean blood. I brought my wife in case my blood is not a match. We'd love to help. Thank you. Saet-byeol. Looking good! Keep fighting! Keep fighting! What are you doing? You came to help, smile. I said smile! Daddy, you're the best. Really? Don't do that. Okay. Daddy? I admit you're far from the dad I imagined. A bit. Right. But Daddy... I can't imagine life without you now. I'm happy just being with you. And you? Me, too. Really? How much? A hundred! No. A hundred! And... No... A hundred! Saet-byeol. Are you crying? Does it hurt? No, I'm fine because I have you, Daddy. Saet-byeol. I have to go. I'm tired. What? Saet-byeol. You're pretty. Daddy likes you a lot. Don't be sick. Okay. Saet-byeol! Saet-byeol, wait! Saet-byeol! I told you not to come to school. You have no fear, don't you? The world is scary, you know? What if you walk alone and a man jumps out and says let's go somewhere? You're small. What if he says to come to him? Then you say go away, but he says no and... Wait for me! Wait up! Who's the boy back there? Your boyfriend? He looks weird. Don't be silly. What do you mean? You act so lovey-dovey with a boy and...
