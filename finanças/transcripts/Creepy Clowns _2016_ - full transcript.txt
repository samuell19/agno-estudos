(whooshing) (dramatic music) (somber piano music) (inspiring instrumental music) - That's what you fucking said the last time. - You're making a big deal out of nothing. - Oh, you can just go to hell, you motherfucker. - It's just Melony Proctor. She's a fucking whore anyway. It's her job. - How am I supposed to have a real conversation with you when you're dressed like this fucking Bozo? - Bitch, don't you ever fucking mock me. - Why not? Who else is laughing? Except maybe Melony Proctor. - You come back here and take it. Come on. So you think I'm a joke, huh? I'm the man around here. I'm the fucking man. Fuck. (somber music) What you doing? - Nothing. - I don't know. Doesn't look like nothing to me. Here, let me see. - Hey, give it back! - Wait. - Give it! - This ain't so impressive. (laughing) Calm down, why don't you? Just calm down. Wait a minute. Nah, this is shit. Don't get all weepy now. You don't want to be labeled a cunt like your mother. Do you? (laughing) What do you think, Larry? You think I'm funny, right? What's the matter with you, kid? You never laugh. All the times I've known you, I can't even get you to crack a smile. You must be as fucking dense as these ignorant pig fuckers around here. - You're the worst clown ever. - Really? Not funny? Not funny?! I'll show you funny, kid! - Let me go! Stop! (ominous music) - Give me that. - Let me go. - You want funny? You got it. (laughing) - Get off me. - Am I touching you? Am I touching you? Am I touching you? Am I touching you? Am I touching you? Am I touching you? Coochie, coochie-choo. Coochie, coochie, coochie-coo. Coochie, coochie, coochie-coo. You wanted funny! You got it! (laughing) Coochie, coochie, coochie-coo. Coochie, coochie-coo. I work so hard. I slave away for you bastards to get a descent wage. You'd think I'd get a little support. A little kindness? A little glad? (laughing) Look at this bullshit. I don't know what's going on here. What is this? (gasping) Hey, what's going on here? (gagging) There's something wrong with the kid! Lyla! - Larry! What did you do to my baby? Oh my god. God damn it, call 911. - All right. - Baby, look at me. Baby, it's okay, honey. - Yeah, is this the police? Yeah, this is Dale again. We've got a bit of an emergency. It's my girlfriend's kid. He's having a brainstorm or something. I don't know. Look, we need an ambulance. Maybe he's dying or something. I don't know. I told you before, the kid's a tard. Yeah. A few minutes? All right, I'll be expecting you. All right. (dramatic piano music) - Hey. I thought I'd try you one last time before I leave in the morning. I know. Peyton, I know. Would you cut me some slack? We're just chilling one last time before I leave in the morning. I'm flying out first thing in the morning. No excuses. (radio rock music) Hey, I gotta go. Yeah, I'll call you after-- - You ready to roll? - I love you too, bye. What's up, guys? - [Guy] What up, dude? - How you been, man? Good to see you. - Good to see you guys. What's up? - All right, before we go, I got some shit you guys gotta see. - He's been going on and on about this shit all day. - Well, what is it? - You know my cousin upstate? He's being paroled. - Paroled? - Come on, fucker, get to the point. - All right, don't rush me, Jesus. You're fucking up my story here. - Story? You're not exactly Hemingway. - Hemingway? Whatever. Before he got taken away, his crew they planted some shit out here, you feel me? Some good shit. - No shit. - No shit, indeed. - Listen, it's your call, college boy. You're the one whose gotta catch a flight in the morning, but if you say the word, we'll split. - Come on, man. Xbox and beer our last night? Fuck that. Come on, for old times sake. - I guess. Why bother flying if you can't fly high, right? (laughing) - That's my boy. Tony, you better be right about this shit though. - Follow me. (somber piano music) (enchanting instrumental music) Motherfucker. - What is that? - That guy over there. He's pissing all over the product. - Fuck it, let's just get out of here. - No, fuck that shit. That's your cousin's legacy, right? You're gonna let some asshole come out here and piss all over his legacy? - Fuck no. - Yeah, that's right, boy. You go get that shit and while you're at it, show that fucker who's boss. - Fucking right. Hey, asshole. What the fuck you think you're doing? - Taking a piss. - You asking or telling, old man? (ominous music) You ain't going nowhere. - I didn't realize you wanted to watch. I could try to take another pee if it'll make you happy. - You motherfucker. (intense music) - Tony, what the fuck? - You motherfucker! You fucking scum! Fucking ruined the fucking shit, you motherfucker! You fucking pissed on my shit! You hear that guy? He's a fucking fag or some shit. - Calm down. What the fuck is wrong with you? (intense music) (eerie music) - Whatever. When you two are done stroking each other's cocks. You know, fuck both you guys. - What the fuck? Fuck you. - You're fucking psycho. I didn't think you'd actually do it. - Did you hear? He called me a fucking fag or something? He's just a fucking old man. - You okay? (gagging) (ominous music) (screaming) (foreboding music) (laughing) (knocking) (coughing) - Fuck. (knocking) - [Man] Professor Hanson? - Be right there. - Sorry I'm late, professor. I was finishing that sketch last week. I have some cool stuff to show you. Check out this cool pen. Doesn't it look very Marquis de Sade? (ominous music) This sketch. (foreboding music) Nathan said that he was gonna come around six. Something to do with his mom and pills or something. Professor, what happened here? What happened to your eye? - Long night. (ominous music) (stepfather laughing) - [Stepfather] Think I'm funny now? I'm funny, right? You gonna laugh? You think I'm funny? (laughing) (foreboding music) - Professor? (somber piano music) (eerie music) Professor, are you okay? (ominous music) Professor? (eerie music) (exciting video game music) (knocking) - Go away. (knocking) Not coming. (knocking) It's open! Fuck! - All right, motherfucker. Where is he? - Good morning, Peyton. - Morning? It is five in the afternoon, dick fingers. (video game music) Where is he? - He, as in? - My brother. - Brad's gone. You know that. Now, you don't have to make excuses to come see me. He didn't get on the plane, he never called and he's not at school. So where the hell is he? - Your guess is as good as mine. - And your guess would be? That's what I thought. - You can't just. - We have a problem. - I guess so. Hey, where you going? - To Troy's. If anybody knows where he is, that bastard will. They were supposed to hang that night. - I'm coming with you. - Why? - You know. Protection. - Please. (ominous music) (moaning) (evil laughing) (moaning) (giggling) (groaning) (foreboding music) (groaning) (gasping) - Why are you doing this to me? Please stop hurting me. What are you doing? What are you doing? - Coochie, coochie, coochie-coo. (laughing) Coochie, coochie, coochie-coo. Coochie, coochie, coochie-coo. Coochie, coochie, coochie-coo. (knocking) - Help! Help me, please! Please help! - Coochie, coochie, coochie-coo. (groaning) (gagging) Coochie, coochie, coochie-coo. (knocking) (gasping) (reggae music) - Knock, knock. What are you doing? - Get the fuck in here. Close that door. What the fuck you two think you're doing busting into people's homes like that? - The door was open. - Where's my brother? - Shit. What makes you think? - Cut the shit, Troy. - What the fuck did you say to me, bitch? - What the fuck is going on? - You wanna see a bitch? You were with him last night and yet here you are. So where the fuck is he? I'm not gonna ask again. - Yeah? Then what? You gonna cut me? Please. You have no motherfucking clue the shit I've seen little girl. - Where is he, Troy? - Tony's in there. He was the last one to see him. You with her again? - Never kiss and tell, my man. - Yeah. (heavy metal music) (Tony moaning) - Come on, now. (yelling) Shit! Jesus Christ, get out! - Where's Brad? - How the fuck should I know? - Enough! Show me. - No, I'm ain't showing you shit. Let me go get my pants. - Professor. (foreboding music) Sam? Come on, is this a joke? Get up. Sam, come on. (foreboding music) - This is a bad idea. - Keep moving. - Tell us again about this killer clown, Tony. - Shut up, Conner. - Shut up! - All of you, shut the fuck up. When I find Brad, I am whooping his ass and then I am whooping all of yours. - Damn, girl. Fucking sexy. - Shut up. - There. - Okay. And? - That's where we last saw him. I'm out of here. - Wait. - What happened? - Just tell her already. - Well, we came here looking for my cousin's stash and there was this guy, this creepy motherfucker and he attacked us and we ran off. We left Brad behind. When we turned around he was gone. (ominous music) - Listen, you gotta understand. What we saw was... Crazy. We weren't thinking. - Yeah, he changed right in front of us. The way his hair, his eyes, I will never forget the look in his eyes. - Turned into a clown? - Call it what you want, man. - I'm calling it what you guys said. You did say a clown, right? - I never said a fucking clown. - You chicken shits. You ran and you left my brother to die so that someone wouldn't find your stash. - No. It wasn't like that. No. - I will kill you. If he is dead, you're next, motherfucker. You're both fucking next! (yelling) - Shit. There goes our ride. (intense music) - Shit. (somber piano music) - We're gonna find him. I mean it. - He's dead, Conner. (crying) - Come on. Don't say that. We can go to the cops. They'll have every officer in the city looking for him. - They know his history. They know his rap sheet. If he's dead, they're not gonna give two shits. They'll throw a fucking party. He was a bad kid. A kid. And this was finally it. Was finally his chance to get out of here and to make something of himself. I knew it. I knew I should've stopped him from going out. He was so fucking close, Conner. He was so fucking close. (crying) - It'll be okay. I'll help you out. - I have to go. - I'll come with you. - No. I'm fine, really. Tomorrow, okay? - Yeah. Sure. - Thanks. For everything. (car engine starting) Hey. It's me. I just need to freshen up. Be half an hour, all right? All right, I'll see you soon. - God, I need this. I really need this. - What is it you need, baby? - She's the only thing that calms me, mom. I can't help it. Whenever I'm with her, I feel so alive. (stepfather laughing) - I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but if this bitch is the only thing you need, buddy, you're more fucked up than we thought. - You shut up. - Or what? - Leave him alone, you monster. - Monster, aye? That's cute. Your precious baby boy kills three people in cold blood and I'm the monster. - I didn't do that. Did I? - Oh, you bet you did. Tickled them. Weird, right? Except for that first one. You ripped his throat out real good. Now that was a mad kill, if I ever saw one. - No, no, no. - Baby, calm down. Dale's just messing. Dale, tell Larry you're just messing. Dale. Tell Larry. Dale. - This can't be happening. Not again. - Oh it is. Over and over and over and over and over and over. - What the hell did you do to me? Answer me! (foreboding music) - I believe thank you is in order. - Stop it! Stop it! Stop! Please, stop it. Stop it! (somber music) - Don't act like you can't remember. You can fool her. You can fool yourself. But you can't fool me, boy. (laughing) - What am I? - You're a killer. (knocking) - Hello, Cherry. - Why the long face, baby? Let's get this party started. - I had this one student in art class. One day she wanted to be like Salvador Dali and the next day René Magritte and the next day she thought she was like Van Gogh. She didn't know what she wanted. - So that's why you quit teaching. - No, I quit teaching because she wouldn't drop my class. - You do some really great work. - Thanks. - I think when I quit teaching it really got my creative juices flowing again. I still teach. A few local kids from the neighborhood come here for art classes a couple times a week. Nothing that pays the bills, but at least I get to interact with people. - Not a lot of interaction in your life, Larry? - Sadly, no. Listen to me. I'm rambling like a madman. Tell me about you, Cherry. - Nothing much to tell, really. - Can I assume Cherry isn't your real name? - Next subject. - Sorry. It's just that I really care about you. You come here so often, I feel like we're more than just customer and client. I almost feel like we're... - Friends? We're friends, Larry. If you really wanna know. I recently lost my brother. The only family I had left. - What happened? - He was murdered. - Oh my god. - At least, that's the story that I'm getting. But the ones telling that story are a couple of burnout losers with a sketchy track record and an even sketchier relationship with the truth. - Did they tell you what happened? - Not exactly. Just that he was attacked in the woods by a guy possibly dressed like a clown or some shit. It's all fucking bullshit if you ask me. - A clown? - Yeah. Like I said. Bullshit. They did something to him. I know they did and when I find out what, let's just say... Fuck it. Got anymore? - Actually, that was my last bottle. Cherry, I hate to do this. I've been fighting a cold or allergies or something. - I get it. Let's do this another night. - Really? - Yeah. - You sure? - Yeah, no problem, really. - Okay. I apologize. - For what it's worth, I had a lovely evening. It was a nice distraction. Till the end, of course. Thanks. See you soon? - I'll call you. (somber music) - I told you. A killer. - What do I do? - Trust in me. (eerie music) It's the only way out. - What're you doing, Larry? Give me the knife, baby. (menacing music) - Very nice. (giggling) - Diablo? - My friends call me Diablo. You haven't paid me in two months. Name's Mr. Sanchez to you. - I'm on it. I swear, I swear. - You are a nice piece of ass. Why do you mess around with that old fuck? - Larry's a nice guy. He doesn't need sex. We both win. - You're not here to win. You're my whore. Whores fuck. Start fucking him and stop fucking me. I want my money. You get it from him or you get a bullet to the brain. (foreboding music) Tomorrow night. (exciting video game music) (knocking) - Yeah, coming. (somber music) What're we doing? - Don't make me beg. After all the shit I've been, I need to feel loved again. Just one night. Can you do that? Good. Now shut up. (somber piano music) - Good morning. - Morning. - Some night, huh? - Yeah, I'd say so. - I love you. - Conner, this isn't. We can't do this. - This is what you wanted. This is what you asked for. I'm here. I'm right here, Peyton. - I wasn't thinking last night. Shit just got out of hand and I needed someone. - And I was there. - Exactly. And I still need you, Conner. I need you to help me find Brad. - And then? - Then, I don't know. - That's not a no. - It's not a no. But... - But? - I am in big fucking trouble, Conner. Big fucking trouble. - Go on. - No, fuck it. I've got it, really. - What? - Hey! - Who's Larry? - Fuck you, Conner! - It's Diablo, isn't it? He's got you again, doesn't he? (dramatic music) Spend the day with me. Tell me everything. I'll just shut up and listen. (crying) It's gonna be okay, Pey. But as punishment, you're gonna be second player. (laughing) (reggae music) - Hey. Go get us some food. Come on. - Fuck you, pot boy. You get us some food. - Fuck you. Go get food. - Fuck. - Make it snappy. - "Make it snappy." (reggae music) - Ah! (somber music) (phone chiming) - This is your big chance. Take care of her, that's one less loose end to worry about. - She's not a loose end. - She starts playing Scooby-Doo, the cops get involved. The cops get involved, we're fucked. - I suppose you're right. - Yeah. I'm always right. You know what to do. - I know, I know. - Just make sure you get rope. Nylon. Not that cheap kind that sheds shit everywhere. And tape. Lots and lots of tape. Duct, not masking. - Why would I get masking tape? I'm not a complete moron. - Really? Where'd you stash the bodies, Larry? - That's a valid point. - After we take care of your little fuck ups, we hit the road. New town. New identities. New kills. This time, we'll be unstoppable. (somber music) - Shit! Shit! Shit! (engine puttering) Fuck! Yeah, motherfucker. I know who you are. No, you ain't getting in here. Fuck! (engine puttering) Fuck. (ominous music) (coughing) (foreboding music) Fuck! (eerie laughing) (yelling) (eerie laughing) What the fuck? - Coochie coochie. Coochie. Coochie Coochie coochie, coo. Coochie coochie, coo. Coochie coochie, coo. (laughing) (foreboding music) - Is that all you got, man? Holy shit! (laughing) - Coochie coochie, coo. Coochie coochie, coo. (laughing) (eerie music) (gagging) (somber music) (Dale laughing) - Get the address. We need to check the place. More loose ends, I'm sure. (eerie music) (foreboding music) (screaming) - Who are you? What the fuck? Let me out of here. Fucking kill you. Let me go. Just stand there, you fucking freak. (creepy laughing) What the fuck are you doing? What is that? (creepy child-like laughing) Shit, man. - Coochie coochie, coo. Coochie coochie, coo. (laughing) Coochie coochie, coo. Coochie coochie, coo. - Stop! Please. Stop, please. Please. Please, cut it out. Please, stop. Stop. Stop. Stop, please. (gasping) - Coochie coochie, coo. Coochie coochie, coo. (intense music) - What the fuck? Stop. Stop! I swear. Stop. Let me go, you fucking freak. (eerie laughing) (intense music) (gasping) What the fuck? I'm gonna kill you. What the fuck? Put that down. No. Oh, fuck. No. Please, no! No! Oh god. (intense music) Fuck. (laughing) Oh, Jesus Christ. Oh my god. Oh fuck. (booming) (ominous music) - Now, the girl and we're home free. (laughing) (somber music) (video game music) - You're going down. - I gotta go. This isn't up for discussion. I have to, Conner. - Why? Why can't you just stop? - Because if I don't get him his money, I will have bigger problems than Tony and Troy. You know how serious he is. - Let me take care of him. - And do what? Kill him? His people will find you and it won't end until we're all dead. Or I can end it now. I can get him his money and I can get him out of my life. - You think it'll be that easy? - There are no other options for me. - I love you. I've always loved you. But I can't let you kill yourself for money. - Bye, Conner. (somber music) - Wow. You look terrific. - Thank you. - You know what to do. The bitch dies. - I know. - I'm sorry? - Nevermind. I was just thinking of something. Sit down. Well, here we are. - Here we are. - Can I get you something? - Just these clothes off me. - I thought you'd never ask. Let me get the room ready. I have a surprise for you. I want this to be special. Make yourself at home. (dramatic music) - You really like the moon. - You're wasting time. (foreboding music) (ominous music) - Brad. (gasping) - Get her. (yelling) - No! No! (intense music) Get off me! - You let her go, we're done for! (screaming) - Peyton! - No! No! No! Conner! (booming) - Shit. (tire screeching) Stop it, please! - Shut up! - Let me go! Let me go! - Sit down. - Diablo, wait. - Hands behind your back. - Let me go and I will get you your money. Let me go, please. - It's too late begging. - Let me go! Diablo! Diablo, please. I will get you your money. I will get you your money. - All right, bitch. You die. - Let me go. I will get you your money. - Too late, bitch. Now you'll know the fires of hell. - Diablo, listen to me. Listen to me. Just let me go and I will get you your money. Please. Don't do this. Just let me go. - Shut up, bitch. - Just let me go! You let me go! Let me go! - Burn in hell. I'll roast marshmallows on your tits. - Look at me. Don't do this and I will get the money. I will get you more than your money. I will get you so much money. I will be your best girl. - You die! - No! No! (screaming) Stop! Diablo! - Burn, burn, burn! I smelled a cunt. Dirty whore. No one messes around with Diablo Sanchez. Shit! Forgot my matches. Sorry, I'll be back. - Help! Help! Help! - Hey! Hey! - Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up! - I'm moving. I'm moving. (creepy laughing) - Larry. (eerie music) - What the fuck? - What're you doing? - I love you. - [Peyton] What? (intense music) (eerie music) (intense music) (creepy laughing) (exciting music) (intense music) (yelling) - What? (carnival music) (foreboding music) - No! (gasping) (somber music) What do you want from me? You wanna kill me? You wanna fuck me? Do it, Larry. I'm tied up. I am a helpless little girl. Yeah. Oh yeah, that's what us whores like. - What are you doing? This is no time to fuck with her. That guy's gonna come back in here again any minute. Could be another loose end. Do you want another loose end? - Come on! What are you waiting for? I'm here for the taking, right? (crying) Abuse me. The others did. (laughing) (dramatic music) I hate you.
