- Hello? - Hi, good afternoon. Can I speak to Mr. Washington please? - Speaking. - Hi, Mr. Washington. My name is Amanda Barnes. I'm calling from the credit check and safety board. Sir, do you currently use a credit card? - I do, yes. - Did you misplace it recently? - I don't think so. Why, is there some kind of problem? - There might be. Your account is showing a series of very expensive purchases made across the country. - Oh dear. Well, I'm quite certain my card is in my wallet. - Do you mind checking for me? - Of course. Hold on just a moment. Hello? - I'm still here, Mr. Washington. - I have my credit card. - Excellent. Can you confirm the number for me, sir? - 4-1-2-4 - 869-227 - 140. - And the expiry date. - 07/23. - And on the back of the card, you should find a three digit number. - Yes, it says 3-2-2. - That's great. Thank you, sir. Now with your permission, I'd like to cancel the card. Just to be safe. - Yes, please do. - Excellent. In the meantime, I wanna make sure you're not missing any essential payments. I'd imagine a man of your age is taking one or two medications? - I wish it was only two. - Hmm, I hear you, sir. I'd be happy to set up a direct deposit with your pharmacy if you like. - I would be very grateful for that. Thank you so much for your help. - My pleasure, Mr. Washington. Would you happen to have a copy of your latest prescription handy? I am the master of my own fate. I am the champion of my own cause. I am queen of the jungle. Woo! - Yeah, it's a DSLR. Yeah, it's... 899? It's brand new. Yeah. All right. Yeah, best quality. All right, I'll send you a photo. Yeah, it's the last one I got. All right, cool. Thanks a bunch. Perfect, yeah. All right, 599. Sold. First things first. Let's get basic terminology out of the way. Green versus red. Bear versus bull. Long versus short. What does it all mean? If you're buying a stock, you're betting that the share price will go up. This action is called going long, and it makes you a bull. But what goes up must come down, and you can bet against a stock by taking out a short position. This is being a bear. Bulls, they wanna see green. And bears, they wanna see red. Don't let greed and fear drive your decisions. Play smart, play long. Let value accumulate. Manage your risk. Limit taxation. Diversify your portfolio. Above all else, remember, luck will always be a factor. No matter how much you study and learn and think you know... You can't beat luck. - Emily Ross. - Hi, hi, Miss Ross. It's Debbie Harris calling. We, we spoke over email. - How can I help you, Debbie? - I noticed in your book you mostly focus on long-term retirement planning, five, sometimes ten year growth, and I'm just wondering why you didn't talk about short-term investing. - You're talking about day trading? - Yeah. - Well, day trading is nothing more than a get rich quick scheme. The very concept spits in the face of healthy financial growth. - But some people must be successful. - Oh, what people? - I don't know, I guess, I just, I see these guys online and I just -- - Oh, right, right, and in the history of the internet, no one's ever lied before? Yeah? No one's ever pretended to be something they're not? - Well, when you put it that way. - Look, you called me because you wanted the truth, yeah? So here it is. A million suckers walk into a casino, they feed the same machines and they chase the same jackpot. Who walks out the richest? - The casino. - Boom. Any way you slice it, the house always wins. Imagine volunteering for solitary confinement. That's what being a day trader is. You do not eat, you do not sleep, and you don't even blink because the action never stops. The game never stops. Does that kind of life sound appealing to you? - Relax. Gather your senses. Get your bearings. You know this place. You're safe here. This is your mind, and your mind is your temple. And now it's time to get to work. - Okay, today we're talking about bullish indicators, AKA technical signs that a stock might go green. These are the hammers, the flags, wedges. Three white soldiers. As always, I talk fast and I talk smart, so pay fuckin' attention. - Did the stock close near its high of the day? ...what's the reason... ...up consistently... ...short term catalysts... ...heavy resistance, parabolic... Is it healthy pullback? Higher lows leading a staircase ascension. Or is it genuine short interest? - Now that you know the fundamentals, you need to practice before you can preach. Pick up a pen and paper and take the market for a test drive. - I don't give a shit whether you buy long or you sell short. Just make sure you understand one thing. You're not an investor, you're not a guru, you're not a prophet, you're a player. - The sooner you all wrap your heads around that, the sooner you win. - Dear Lord, thank you for giving me the strength and will to carry on. Thank you for gracing me with the drive and determination I need to survive in this cruel world. Deltaprex Pharmaceutical recently completed a clinical trial testing their new anti-cancer drug on over 200 patients. Today is the day they announce the results. I am betting everything I have that their stock will fall today. - I am the master of my own fate. I am the champion of my own cause. I am the queen of the jungle. - Piece of shit is tanking. Fucking bears win again. Weak hands are dumping here. Don't sell now. Same old biotech trash. Fuck these asshole shorts just banked. Last time I ever hope for a cure for cancer. Hello Bob. - Talk to me about Deltaprex. Why did you think they were a great short? - Pharmaceutical companies usually go green in advance of their clinical trial results. This one's been red all week. I thought that was odd. - Well, most of the speculators on Market Mouth say that's because traders are afraid to hold through news. - With all due respect, speculators on Market Mouth don't know what the fuck they're saying. - I agree. Keep talking. - The downtrend can only mean one of two things. Option one, insiders knew they were holding legit cure for cancer. They drove the stock to premium prices and accumulated in the run-up to the good news. - And option two? - Insiders knew they were holding a turd. Either way, it's all corrupt. - I see. Why did you go with the one where the cure fails? - I don't believe in miracles. - Hmm. Did you pray today? - Sorry? - Pray, pray. There's nothing to be ashamed of. I pray every time I make a big trade. - I prayed. - And what did you pray for, Daisy? Was it a miracle by any chance? - That's between me and God. - Okay, fair enough. So how does a fast learning, hard working motivated person such as yourself stay so focused? You taking anything? - Only a shitload of stimulants. - Okay, good. Now listen to me. You wanna add a little bit of coke to your diet, all right? There's no better focus than a sweet-ass line of blow. - I'll get some tonight. - Good. What else are you up to tonight? - I'm thinking after I get off the phone with you, I'll light some candles and touch myself. - Well, that sounds fun. - It usually is. - Do you mind if I offer you another piece of advice? - It'd be my pleasure. - Every so often, what you should do is send me a few pictures of your tits. I got a feeling it's gonna remind me how much I fucking love the sound of your voice. - How about I trade you for them? - Hmm. What do you want in return? - I want you to think about me when you jerk off later. I want you to think about how much money we're gonna make together. I want you to think about how good it's gonna feel when we put all that cash into a great big pile, and I fuck you on top of it. - Would you like to hear a secret? - I'm dying to hear a secret. - I really am a broker. I work for a world-renowned private equity firm. - Now, why would a real broker hang out in a place like Market Mouth? - Why do you think? We can talk about technical analysis till we're both hard and wet, but the truth is, the market runs on fear and greed and hype. Don't buy the hype. Create the hype. Start the fire yourself and you'll never get burned. - I want you to imagine that you're on a desert island. You have no food, no water. You're the only living creature for miles. You feel the dry leaves with your brittle hands. Your exhausted feet drag with each heavy step. You nearly succumb to the despair of your loneliness and isolation. Then you hear it. The treeline gives way to a small freshwater spring, and you move toward the soothing sounds of the waterfall. But you know where there is water, there must also be life. The great lion roars. The water is his territory. The king stands between you and your survival. Do you turn tail and run? No. You plant your feet and you get your ass ready for a fight. You are master of your own fate. Champion of your own cause. Queen of the motherfucking jungle. Now show him why. - In the pharmaceutical sector, every clinical trial is a catalyst. And every leak on the dark web gives you an edge. So you design a few dummy accounts to create a buzz, and you stir the Market Mouth pot with some bots. He'll have no choice but to keep you close. - There are riots in the streets. What stock do you buy? - The company that makes guns. What about an epidemic? - Anyone that develops vaccines is in play. The lower the float, the greater the volatility. - And how long do you hold? - I don't. Get in before the pump. Get out before the dump. - Can you feel how deep I am? - Fuck, you're so deep. - Are you close? - I'm so close. - God, I'm so fucking deep. You want me to fill my cum up inside you? - I want you to come inside me. - Yeah. Oh fuck. Oh fuck I'm coming. - Oh God, me too. - Ohhhhhh! - And just like that, you tame the lion. Now that it's safe, you reach out, you plunge your hands deep into the water, and you take what's yours. Today, you may be red, tomorrow you may be green, but you're not a bear. And you're not a bull. You're an entirely different animal. And you're hungry. - This isn't about the money. This is about what money can buy. Money buys more. More freedom. More power. More. MORE. MORE! Why do you look familiar? - Hello everyone. Thank you for joining us. My name is Patricia Sawyer, CEO of Clean Therapeutics. I'm here today with the Board of Directors and we are thrilled to announce the official commencement of phase two of our Clean PTSD study. PTSD, of course, stands for Post-traumatic Stress Disorder, a mental health condition triggered by a specific event. The symptoms include vivid nightmares, intrusive flashbacks, and crippling anxiety. But there's yet to be a proper pill tailored for this condition, and that's where Clean PTSD comes in. Moving into phase two, enrollment is now up to 300 patients, mostly ex-military and victims of abuse and assault. We now begin to examine the effectiveness and safety of the drug, with a timeline of eight to ten months for the initial data. - What are you wearing right now? - Maybe I'm not wearing anything. - Are you being a bad girl? - Actually I was just thinking how you still haven't introduced me to your boss. - Funny, I was just thinking about how your webcam's still broken. - I kind of like it that we keep it to the phone. It's like my body craves your voice. My nipples get hard every time I see you calling. - Jesus. - Do you wanna finish, or should we talk about tomorrow? - Come on, we've talked about it enough. You know your targets. - 9:45. You tell your sheep you're going long on BPMQ. We scalp the pump for 75%, then we use my bots to short the selloff. - And what about Synthro Biogenics? You're certain they're announcing the offering tomorrow? - My contact at the pharma council is positive. My only concern is that the fundamentals are solid. - Nah, fundamentals don't mean shit to a horde of panic sellers. - I'm just saying, I'm not so sure the offering will crush it the way you think it will. I have been trading this stock for two years. What were you doing two years ago? - I don't like looking backwards. - Humor me. - I was a sex worker. - Interesting. Are we talking escort, stripper, rub and tug? - No more, more like sex trafficking. - They branded all of us with a barcode, rented us out to the highest bidder. - Look, I didn't mean any of that. - It's all right. When I got out, I knew I never wanted to be that desperate again. I took every cent I had and I found my calling. - Well, I'm glad you did. Some men can just be complete fuckin' animals. - At least you're one of the nice guys. - If I set up a meeting with you, me, the rest of the firm, can I count on you not to embarrass me? - Every time you ask me that, I always say the same thing. Yes, and it's not gonna change. - Okay. Okay, okay, you come through for me on BPMQ tomorrow and I'll speak to my boss, yeah? But there is one more thing though. - What? - That first day we spoke, you told me you prayed for your short on Deltaprex. What exactly did you pray for? - Why do you wanna know? - You went from a penniless hooker to a six-figure trader. Whatever you said to God, it must have been pretty fuckin' convincing. - Dear Lord, thank you for giving me the strength and will to carry on. Deltaprex Pharmaceutical recently completed a clinical trial testing their new anti-cancer drug on over 200 patients. I am betting everything I have that their stock will fall today. And so I pray to you, Almighty God, benevolent creator of all the heavens and the Earth. I send a prayer back in time, back to the day that trial started, and I beg you, please do not let this drug succeed. Please let the cancer eat those patients alive. Let it consume their organs, and fill their lungs with malignant fluid until they choke on their own blood and die. Please Lord, grant me this good fortune. Amen. - Good afternoon, tech support. Can you confirm your account number? - 082792. - I see you're having some trouble connecting to your network. - No shit, I have no power. Is it just my account, or is there an outage in the area? - Just a moment, I'll check. Okay, it looks like the storm knocked out a power line. If you have to get online, we can set up a data plan. Do you own a smartphone? - It needs to be charged. - And you have no power. I hate to say it, but I think you may be out of luck. - You wanna explain to me how I'm supposed to pitch you to my boss as some kind of market messiah when you can't even wake yourself up for the goddamn bell? - I told you, I lost power. - And you don't have a fuckin' laptop? - I haven't used it since I upgraded and the battery was dead. I assure you this won't happen again. - Let me ask you a real question. Why the fuck are you so calm right now? - I made peace with the fact that today was outta my control. - Oh, you made peace? Oh you made peace, that is nice. That's so nice, 'cause while you were busy making peace, I was busy getting fucked in the ass. Who do I blame for that? - I take the blame for BPMQ, and I swear I will make that one up to you. But I warned you about Synthro. - Excuse me? You warned me? - I did. Maybe you should channel some of your frustration into your own shortcomings. Like a man. - Wow. We're done, bitch. - Oh, just like that? - Yeah, just like that. - Who knew you had such thin skin? - Oh, fuck you. What, you think you're hot shit 'cause you wrote some code and programmed a few bots? You're playing games at the kids table. I sit at the high rollers table. I sit beside the best. - I know you do, Bob. - You embarrassed me today. - And I apologize. Like I said, I'll make it up to you, but I can't do that if you don't give me a chance. - You better call me Monday with the ultimate stock tip. Or you can start looking for a new pimp. - Ahh! - You got three seconds to tell me who you are and how you got this number. One, two. - I need some inspiration. - Holy shit. I never thought you'd actually call. - Yeah, well can you help me or not? - You said inspiration, yeah? - I did. - That mean what I think it means? - It means what you think it means. Don't tell me you've actually grown a conscience. - Nah, nah, nah, just -- I just didn't figure you'd want to go down that rabbit hole again. Hallucination leaves scars. Know what I'm saying? - Well if you can't help me, I'll gladly buy somewhere else. - Hey, hey, hey, pump your brakes, mami. Just gotta make sure you won't hold me liable, you feel me? - I promise I won't sue you. What do you got in stock? - I got it all, baby doll. LSD, PCP, DMT, ketamine, mescaline, salvia, bath salts, mushrooms, acid. - Do you have anything new? - It's dangerous. - These are illicit, mind-altering drugs, they're all dangerous. - Nah, this one's different. They call it the Bloody Sundae. Supposed to be a new kind of trip. - Have you moved any yet? - Nah, nobody wants to risk it. There's this whole protocol you gotta follow if you take it. - Explain it to me. - All right, look. Says here you get a 30 CC syringe. 99% solvent, 1% drug. You gotta do 10 CCs with breakfast, 10 with lunch, 10 with dinner. - Why drag it out? - I guess it's like extended release type shit. - Have you heard of any ODs? - My boy sold some to this guy a few weeks back. Took 20 CCs with lunch, dropped dead five minutes later. You sure you wanna do this? - I'll take it. - 10 CCs with breakfast, 10 with lunch, 10 with dinner. - Master of my own fate. Champion of my own cause. Queen of the jungle. Master of my own fate. Champion of my own cause. Queen of the jungle. Master of my own fate, master of my own fate. Champion of my own cause, champion of my own cause. Queen of the jungle, queen of the jungle. Master of my own fate! Champion of my own cause! Queen of the -- - Stop! I want you to imagine that you're on a desert island. You have no food, no water, you're the only living creature for miles. - And that is where Clean PTSD comes in. And that's where Clean PTSD come in. My name is Patricia Sawyer. ...the symptoms include... ...up to 300 patients... ...intrusive flashbacks... ...abuse and assault... ...crippling anxiety... CEO of Clean Therapeutics. Now we begin to examine the effectiveness of the drug. - Don't buy the hype. Create the hype. Start the fire yourself, and you'll never get burned. Bang. Ahh! - You better call me Monday with the ultimate stock tip. Or you can start looking for a new pimp. - Relax. Gather your senses. Get your bearings. You know this place. You're safe here. This is our mind, and our mind is our temple. And now it's time we get to work. - PTSD, of course, stands for Post-traumatic Stress Disorder, a mental health condition triggered by a specific event. - A mental health condition... A mental health condition, a mental health condition... a mental health condition triggered by a specific event. But there's yet to be a proper pill tailored for this condition. And that's where Clean PTSD comes in. And that is where Clean PTSD comes in. And that's where Clean PTSD comes in. We now begin to examine the effectiveness and safety of the drug, with a timeline of eight to ten months for the initial data. Found you. - Yeah? - Is this Mrs. Hamilton? - Who the fuck wants to know? - Mrs. Hamilton, my name is Mollie Reid, I work for a law firm that specializes in wrongful death litigation. - Good for you, I'm hanging up now. - You don't even wanna ask why I'm callin'? - I don't need to ask. It's the same reason every other vulture's been callin'. All you parasites tryin' to make a buck off my son's death. - Ma'am, I promise, money is not my motivation. I'd just like to know more about what happened to your son. - Why? So you can build up a case in the name of good old justice? I've heard that one before, too. - John's passing was an injustice. The amount of people murdered by police every year -- - Those cops didn't kill Johnny. They might have pulled the trigger, but they didn't kill him. It's that drug company that did it. - Tell me about Clean Therapeutics, Mrs. Hamilton. - My baby boy comes home after two tours, tells me his hands won't stop shakin', says the nightmares won't leave him alone. Says he can still hear the bombs and bullets. - John had post-traumatic stress disorder. It wasn't his fault. - I tell my other boy Jack to look after his little brother, but Jack don't listen to me no more. One day I get a knock at the door. Sheriff comes by, tells me Johnny caused a big scene down at the mall, says my son took his clothes off, and then he starts tellin' everyone that the devil's gonna rise up from hell and burn it all down. I remember when he was five years old, Johnny was a cowboy for his birthday. That's the first thing I saw in my head when they told me. Do you have any children? - I have a three-year-old son. - Oh, do you love him? - With all my heart. In fact, I'm lookin' at his beautiful face as we speak. - What's he doin'? - He's playing with his favorite toy. It's this little brown horse. I think my boy might wanna be a cowboy, too. - I just want my son back. - I know, I know. And I wish I could give that to you. But maybe I could give you something else. - I never got it the way Johnny did. Half the time he was livin' in another world. - Yeah, I could tell. He wouldn't look me in the eye, you know? It's like he was just lookin' right past me. Like he was seeing something that wasn't there. - My mother used to say the same thing. Then she forced him to sign up for that damn trial. What made you volunteer for it? - Nightmares. Plus they were payin' and I needed the cash. - You still having those nightmares? - Yep. Already spent the cash, too. - Fucking economy. Bleedin' this country bone dry. - Amen, brother. You got people on the street, not a dime to their name, and those big pharma fuckers, they're burnin' billions. - Billions? It's more like trillions. - It's fucking disgusting is what it is. And the worst part? Nobody gives a shit. They all sit at home on their fat fucking asses, playing the stock market, profiting at the expense of the people who fight and die for their freedom. - I take it you were in the service. - I was. Johnny told me you were, too. - Field artillery, three tours. You? - Intelligence corps. - You miss it? - Every goddamn day. I was really tight with my unit. At the end of our last tour, we uh, we hit up this shitty little tattoo parlor and we got these barcodes on our wrists. - Why barcodes? - We wanted people to know, know that we're all just products of war. A war bought and paid for by the pricks more powerful than us. Do you ever get angry, Jack? I'm talking like real anger. Rage. - That's all I ever feel. Sometimes, sometimes I just wanna hurt someone. - You should. - Are you sayin' I should feel like hurtin' someone? Or are you saying I should hurt someone? - Both. - Lobby has three access points. Seven floors, five fire exits. Conference room on the top floor. One security desk, four staff. Guards armed with semi-automatic pistols, 40 caliber. - You are the master of your own fate. You are the champion of your own cause. You are the queen of the goddamn jungle. And you're about to show them why. - Jesus. Fuck. It's 3:30. - You told me to call you on Monday with the ultimate stock tip. It's Monday. - Okay, hold on. Let me just put together a coffee. - Clean Therapeutics, symbol is CLN. - Let's see, uh, ah come on, that's a $25 stock. - Yes, I'm aware. - Well, we can't manipulate a $25 stock. - We won't need to. - Up or down? - Up. - How do you know? - My contact at the pharma council leaked me a copy of their results. - Well, I'm gonna need to see this leak for myself. - Already sent it to you. - Good, good. Okay, when are they announcing? - It's on Friday. - Okay, look, obviously I need to verify everything with my people, but if we like what we see, we'll get the firm on board. - And you'll tell your boss about me? - My boss? I will tell him everything. - We're in. Long on CLN at 27.25. - How many shares? - One million. I spoke to the boss this morning, he gave me the go-ahead to buy throughout the day. - So when do I get to meet him? - If all goes well on Friday, he wants to see you here next week. - Welcome to Colt Creative Capital, the world leader in finance. Please state your business at the tone, and we'll match you to the appropriate department. - I would like to speak to Mr. Colt about his daughter Sydney. A spot at the abortion clinic just opened up. - How did you know my daughter was pregnant? - The internet is a very educational place if you know where to look. - Well, if you really knew where to look, you'd know that another tabloid scandal is a mere flesh wound. You want to blackmail me sweetheart? You'd better go for the jugular. - I have no intention of blackmailing you, Mr. Colt. I just needed your attention. - Mission accomplished. Now what? - You employ a man named Robert Webb, AKA Bob the Broker. True or false? - True. - Earlier today, Bob suggested you take your firm long on Clean Therapeutics. True or false? - True again. - Did he tell you it was my idea? - Honey, I don't have the faintest fuckin' clue who you are. - That's what I thought. Mr. Colt, I'm the reason why Bob has had his most profitable quarter since he first started at your firm. You're wealthier today than you were yesterday because of me. - That's a bold statement. - By all means, feel free to refute it. You're clearly entitled to think Bob is a decent broker. - Bob's a jellyfish. He happened to come along when the chat rooms got hot and we've been exploiting his following ever since. You gonna tell me what the fuck you want? - I want Bob's job. I want a seat at the high rollers table. - Sometimes I forget what it's like to be on the outside looking in. - In my day, it was the era of the analyst. The analyst says jump, the retail investor says how high. Couple decades go by and we get the dorm room douchebags, masquerading as message board fortune tellers. You'd think everyone would wise up when that bubble burst, and yet here we are, another stupid fucking generation who can't seem to grasp that arrogance and ignorance are the same thing. You can sell your vanity to the online circle jerk, and I will sit here and applaud you for recognizing them as the brain-dead sheep that they really are, but don't you dare try to suggest that you have any level of control. You don't and you never will. - I disagree. - You really believe you're special? You're the one who's gonna change the game, sweetheart? - Anyone with a computer and a little bit of ambition can do what I've done. I'm not the future of this game. - So who the fuck are you then? - I am the game. - Fuck me. Now I'm curious. - Did Bob show you the trial results my contact sent me? - Bob said he secured that leak. - I bet he did. What do you think of the data? - Personally, I wouldn't be surprised if Clean saw $50 before the closing bell on Friday. - And what if I told you Clean's gonna hit $3 long before it hits 50? - Did you say $3? - I did. - Are you telling me you think they're gonna drop 90% in a single day? - I don't think, I know. - Well shit, I gather you've been shorting. - Every day this week. - So you're betting against Clean, even though you found the data, the very same data that says it's going sky high. Why are you so certain Clean's gonna crash? - I can't give you that answer for free. - Name your price. - I don't want your money. All I'm asking for is your faith. - Well, in that case, I believe my firm and I will be sticking with our long position on Clean Therapeutics, one million shares at 27.25 per share. - Well, in that case, you can call me back at 4:01 on Friday, and let me know how it feels to get stung by Bob the jellyfish. - You said $3, right? - You know what? Make it 2.99. - 2.99 it is. Good luck with that, sweetheart. - Thanks. Enjoy the show. - This is the moment we've been waiting for. ...anyone got the link... ...I posted the link... What time's the conference call? ...it's at noon... ...pretty sure it's 12:30... This drug is gonna change so many lives. ...Patricia Sawyer cares... ...best stock ever... I love Clean Therapeutics. This could be the biggest trade of the year. Market opens in five, four, three, two. - Hello? - Mrs. Hamilton, it's time. - I keep saying there's something wrong with my boy. I keep telling 'em their pill's playing tricks on his mind, but they don't care. - Is this legit? ...gotta be fake... ...are people selling? I think CLN's going red. ...it's fake news... ...Hamilton bitch is lying... This woman is a hedge fund puppet. He had a mental breakdown, so what? Where's the proof? It's clearly a fake document. - I just couldn't keep quiet no more. No way. People need to know the truth about this godforsaken company. - What the fuck? Why are we already down 10%? I'm down $2,000, should I sell? No, buy more. It's gonna go back up. Fuck it, I'm selling. Sometimes I just hate this game. - You should see an old lamp post with yellow graffiti. It's coming up in about half a klick. - I see it. - Turn left at the stop sign. You see a warehouse up ahead? - I do. - Pull your vehicle to a stop beside the dumpster on the south side of the building. - Copy that. - Well done, soldier. You've successfully reached the ammunition supply point. Exit the vehicle and secure the package. - Package secure. - Open it. What do you think, Jack? - It's beautiful. - I'm glad you like it. Now put the car back and drive and proceed to target. - Hello everyone. My name is Patricia Sawyer, CEO of Clean Therapeutics. Before we begin our conference call as scheduled, I need to address the false claims lobbied at our company this morning. Let me be clear, we have never had any communication with this woman. And her son John, never participated in our Clean PTSD clinical trial. The documents she shared online are 100% fake. Cheap forgeries designed to suggest that her son was on our patient enrollment list and that we doctored our own trial results to cover up his adverse reaction to the drug. These are all lies, and we will press charges against all responsible. Justice will prevail. - I'm in position. - Lock and load. Talk me through the layout. - Seven floors, five fire exits. - What about security? - One desk, four staff. Guards armed with compact 40 cal. - And the conference room? - It's on the top floor. - That's where they are, Jack. Safe and sound in their ivory tower.
