Is it music? I told you to only peddle the cycle. Did I tell you to play music? Stop your singing and ride fast. - Oh... Stop...stop! Stop! Get down. Is it only till here? - Yes. Should I walk from here? - Yes. What attitude is this, Gopi Chetta? I gave you free lift till here, isn't it? From here on you can walk. I'm healthy like this because I walked in the past. Hey kid, stop there! Is it readymade? The cut is not good. - I'll bear with it. But I won't bear it. Dear Madhuri! Sister, what is she doing? Madhuri! Can't you hear Gopi chettan calling? Allow me to get ready. She is getting ready. Then I'll sit down. I need not stand and get tired. Did you meet the agent? The boy is working in bank. - He belongs to which place? Ettumanoor. Dear! Dear! You do me a small help. A small one. It's Palampadam Kariya advocate's younger daughter's marriage. For the party of that, I need to stitch 20 blouses. I took the full contract of that. Good! Are you going to restart tailoring? Not me. You. - Me? Dear! You can do it yourself. Oh God! That is not possible. You know it, isn't it? The minute I hold scissors, my hand shakes. I come at night tired from my job. In-between that don't come with such ideas. I took advance. - You return it. I spent it. As an offer of gratitude to your teacher, you must do this to me. Isn't there a limit to gratitude? It's how many times since I have shown gratitude? By 6 pm we'll go and take the measurement. How is that possible? I can't leave early. Please! I have promised them. Christmas is about to come, isn't it? This is the last time. I promise this is the last time. - Okay. Wait. I have my cycle. I'll drop you. - No need. We'll divide equally the tailoring charge between us. - Okay. If you say like this, I won't talk to you in future. Madhuri is coming. I'll call you later on. Don't hang up, dear! I dreamt, that we both are travelling in flight to Srilanka. Why don't you dream about Malaysia or Singapore? From long back I don't like Srilanka. For your sake I'll dream about even North Korea, okay? Is North Korea a tourist spot? Is there a lot of place there for sightseeing? Of course! We'll die of taking selfie. She has reached the junction. To where? - Chetta... You overtake that vehicle. Go fast. Go on...go... Stop here. What did you do this? Why didn't you call me? You are not 'Madhuri', you are 'Oru madhuri' (a peculiar type). Even if I call out to you, will you hear? Are you not standing in North Korea? Seeing you coming, I was standing ready. My starting went wrong. If you stand with two mobile phones, not only starting, even finishing might go wrong. Dear, if you plan to sell your plot on the south, let me know. There are many good buyers with me. My dear Varkycha! I told you so many times I'm not selling that plot. - Dear... It is my duty to ask you. It is your duty to say 'no'. Right, dear? The bus is here. Karukachal...Karukachal... Is there a Kunachettan, who has to get down in Karukachal? I think Varkychan will take away my plot by constantly eyeing it. If he again repeats this, I'll abuse him. Do you see that new bus cleaner? He looks so handsome, isn't it? See this. Do you see this? - Take this. Oh God! - Brother... Tell him to drive slowly. Women and children are there in the bus, isn't it? Shouldn't he drive carefully? Isn't it, brother? - Yeah! Chetta, you move to the back. Is your husband coming on Sunday? - Yes. Is it okay dear? -Yeah! Come. One minute! Let me arrange your hair. Good! How is it? My Goodness! Molly Kutty has got totally transformed. - Right! She looks beautiful! - Hey, look at Molly. Thomacha, I'll call you later on. I'm hanging up. She is standing in a sleeveless dress. Are you not ashamed? Bringing dishonor to the family. Change it! Then walk without clothes. She is revealing underarms and standing. - Hubby... Come. Are you crying for this? Crying is old style. We must be strong. You are beautiful to look at. - Don't you have to leave? It is awesome to wear such clothes. After completing studies and getting a job, you buy such beautiful dresses and wear. Okay? If you cry, not only collyrium, but this beauty will also go away. Go. Hey, go and ask. I'll ask. Hold this. Shall I leave early, today? If you come late, how can you leave early? Morning I was late by only 3-3.45 minutes. I swear it was the fault of the bus. Allow me to go. - You get sir's permission. Ask him. Shall I leave early, today? Do you know, how much is the share of our life in a universe? Do you know, Laila? - I know. But...I won't tell. In that case, I'll tell. From Madurai I came to sell loin. I climbed up with the help of that loin and built this company, which comprises of you all and me. This is not like a government office, where you can come and leave as you feel like. Isn't it, Laila? So, you can't leave early, today. You can go. What? What did she do now? It is black magic. I'm sure about it. You call her back. Oh God! - Madhuri... Tell me the truth. What did you say to God? I told God to forgive you. - For what? I didn't ask permission for one hour to attend party meeting or baptism function. - Then? I want to attend prayer in Lord Muruga's temple. I prayed to God to forgive you for not giving permission for even that. Madhuri, why didn't you tell that? Oh God! I didn't know that. You go and worship. Instead of this, if only you had peddled that sewing machine how good it would have been! You won't do that. Why are you silent? Do you have the tools with you? I have told them, you are highly talented. Am I not? Yes...but I did tell them. Here... It is that girl, who is going to design the wedding dress. Look at this. Isn't it good? - Don't select a common one. Make it something different. For the party, won't it be blouse and 'mundu' for everyone? She has come to take the measurement for the blouse. Aunt, I'll select the material. Don't leave it to them. She'll give the pattern. You stitch accordingly. After 2-3 days, from U.S.A and U.K. some of our cousins will be arriving. You must come to take their measurements also. I'll be leaving the shop late. Is it okay if I come after that? Is everything okay? Shall we leave? Don't we have to go? Get the cycle. I can't ride. If police catches me, I'll lose my license. You can ride. Shall I tell you one thing? - How many pegs did you have? What? I have told you many times to stop this act. Else, I'll stop this. Are you not drinking enough from the morning? Do you have to drink here also? Hop in. Now you don't like whatever I do. Yes, you are highly irritating. When you were born in the hospital, it was I, who picked you up first. Do you know that? - Were you the head nurse there? Stop getting emotional after getting drunk and sit in the cycle. Else you can walk home. Who took you to the first grade? Who taught you swimming? Who took you to watch cinema for the first time? My dear Gopi chetta! You did all that. Will you please stop this? Just now you asked, isn't it? Instead of peddling this cycle, why can't I peddle a sewing machine? My wife eloped with a construction labor. After marriage, my daughter also left me. To me... if I keep peddling a sewing machine, I feel my life has become stagnant. This way I feel my life is moving ahead. That I why I leave with this in the morning. Leave it. Come and sit in the cycle. You are a trained martial artist, isn't it? Can you jump and sit? Change this mood and sing a folk song. You caught it, isn't it? What else? Let me get rid of it immediately. Can't you prepare 'dosa'? Oh God! - I just can't eat this. Did you kill it with one hit? Even one hit was not required. It died for a half hit. I know... - What do you know? What is it? - Get that newspaper. The boy is good. He is employed in a bank. His native is Ettumanoor. No dowry is required. He likes you. The boy will come tomorrow morning. I can't deck up and appear. Don't tell him to come tomorrow. I'll inform after 2 days. Will you inform after 2 days? Don't keep on pestering me saying this. It is the bank manager. Please sit down! - What is your plan? People won't come to pay the debt incurred by your father. Do you know how much is the arrears? Isn't there a plot bought by your father? Sell that and pay off the bank dues. Do you both have any shame? All these days I kept silent. Next move it will be confiscation. You both, mother and daughter will come to the road. Else you'll have to hang and commit suicide like your husband. Let us go. Why don't you ask for some more grace time from that manager? Chetta! My dear Chetta! Should you defecate only in my plot? In this way... I can feel the breeze, hum a song... Your eldest son is in army, isn't it? He can get fan from army canteen for a cheap price. Install one in your toilet. Else I'll buy one for you. Then you can get breeze and sit as long as you want. Okay. - What okay? Okay...okay... Leave it. - You go home. I'm mad out of tension and his okay... - Okay...okay... Is there no alternative other than selling this plot? Ticket...ticket... Where are you going, sister? Chetta, two tickets for Kottayam. Get down...get down fast. 'Don't the farmers need to live in this country?' 'What can we do for our fellow people?' 'Without them how can we survive?' 'They are all suffering now'. - How much is this? 10 rupees. Where did you go? What happened? Tell me. - A fellow groped me. Then? - I couldn't catch the fellow. Did you recognize him? - If I see, I can identify him He is a vegetable vendor in the market. Is this enough or do you want to see some other color? This is enough. Okay. Hey, you can take leave by saying you are not feeling well. No need. I'm alright. You go. What did that manager say? Tell me what he said. We'll have to sell the plot in the south. Mom, get me some medicinal oil. Shall I prepare tea? I don't want tea. Why don't you want tea, today? Otherwise you drink so much of tea as soon as you arrive. I'm telling you I don't want it. Why are you sitting in the dark? What happened? Nothing. I fell from the bus. - Then? Nothing happened. You give that to me. Actually what happened? An elephant attacked me. Are you satisfied? Gopi has brought the fabric from the marriage house. Switch off that light. 'Shantha, you b***h! 'I'll burn you alive.' 'Then I'll marry again and she'll give birth to hundred children.' 'Women is a curse on this earth' 'All of you are a curse' 'Who'll live with a useless like you?' You are a corpse. Where are you going? Women will line up in front of me. Hey, you jackfruit buffalo! 'Shantha, scumbag!' I'll show you that I'm a man. Stop! Dear...how did you address me now? How can you call me with disrespect? I'm your Chandran Chettan. I have carried you. If you touch sister Shantha again, I'll dig a hole for you. I have stopped. I have put an end to everything. Shantha, if you serve dinner, I'll eat. 'You won't get any dinner today. - It is okay.' What is this? It's Appuchettan who, said you are here. Why did you arrive so early? I want to hit him. Madhuri, you leave that. He is the type who hasn't attended church or school. He can't get admission in school at this age. But without a church or congregation, I'll give him a mass. Get down...get down... Madhuri... - Sister, get in from the front. Today, for a change I'll board from this side. All of you give way. A sister is coming. What happened? - He is not there. Thank God! You don't walk so fast like P.T.Usha. Stop! Do you need to go to the shop so fast? What will they think if you reach early? Who is going to the shop? Directly to the market. Have you decided to teach him a lesson? He is the guy. Hey, come here. Do you want to beat him? He'll thrash you. They are just criminals. Do you want to attack me in the dark? Now you attack me. Attack me! Tell the uniform wearing police officers to come in person. I'm not 'Antappan'. I'm 'Aanappan' (a man). I'm enough in this market. Madhuri, you leave that. A fellow groped me once in a festival. I lost my breath. What do they get by groping like this? Is the bite over? - How will it end? It'll be there till they are alive. I was talking about 'Ethakka Appam' (banana fry). From today onwards you carry a pin in your hand. I do only like that. Don't pay heed to all this. I told her all this. She is not listening. This is your first time. I have suffered a lot like this. Leave it. I feel afraid hearing all this. Just by the swinging of his hand, you'll die. I also have got fear. How can I remain silent saying that? Let him kill if he wants. But before I die, I'll surely hit him once. Did he come from the back? He'll tremble to stand in front of a brave woman. Will you spare him? Leave alone sparing, hereafter I won't allow him to do anything. I heard that he is in hiding. It's okay. We'll find a solution. Why are you so much interested in this? Chetta, a guy created ruckus here in the morning, isn't it? Where is he now? Is it the one who received or the one who gave? The one who gave. - Hey, did you see Antappan? He is near the toilet. Go straight and turn right. Did you guess who it is? - Is it Antappan's mistress? Majid, this is different. It is lady police. I can smell and say that. You are not meant to be a betel leaf seller. You were meant to be born as a sniffer dog. Shuck! Born in a good family.. - Oh God! Hey! I feel afraid. This is the right place to shit out of fear. You can fear confidently. Let us go back. If you back out, I'll stick knife in your belly. Chetta, is Antappan there? Who is that inside? Is it Antappan? No, it is Babu. It is not him. Where can he be found? Who are you to Antappan? - I'm his worker, sir. He is a bigger worker than you. Where did he escape? The mobile is switched off. - If we don't get Antappan, we'll take you. Hey, Robin from Thiruvalla. All those who have tried to oppose Antappan have paid for it. He'll be in 'boat jetty' (harbor). Where are you going, sister? Tonight, you won't get any boat. Only tomorrow it'll ply. Get down. Come here. - Let us go in auto. You come here. You leave. I have stopped performing in auto. Rent a room. - I won't. In spite of having a vehicle of your own, you haven't stopped travelling in bus, isn't it? You sit in the bike. Hey! Hey! Hey! You come. Why are you so late? Do you know how many times I called you? I couldn't get Rosamma also. What has happened this girl? She is neither eating nor drinking. You go inside. Why are you making your mother suffer like this? Why can't you call and inform her? Gopi Chetta, I can't stitch that dress. What are you saying this? Did you hear what she said? She won't stitch that. Something has happened to her seriously. You ask her. It is difficult to hold on any more. You contact a real estate broker and fasten up the dealing. I'm asking this because I know you from childhood. Is there any other problem? He said wrong. If you can't tolerate the song, there is a solution. If a punch is given in the jaw, he'll buckle up on the ground like a chopped off plantain. Repeat it.- Is it to apply it against me? By folding the hand like this, in this spot... Why are you asking all this unwanted things? You try to complete that tailoring work. I'll arrange for the money that you took from them. She is worried about losing that plot. You don't ask her anything for the time being. Tell her to inform the date, when we can ask the boy to come for match making. You know, Gopi, isn't it? If I die, she'll become alone. Forget it. If I leave, you'll also become alone. What is your plan? I'm traveling alone, isn't it? That's all. 'The number you are trying to reach is switched off.' It is switched off. - Then we'll go back. Not only that. We heard that he is in hiding, isn't it? Then we won't find him in the house. 'The number you are trying to reach is switched off' What is wrong with that sweeper woman? She only got his number and address. Why should she take so much trouble to get all this? It is not trouble. It is sincerity. What is so sincere in sending a person to get beaten? I'll deal with her later on. Are you particular about beating him? Why not advise him saying, 'Don't behave again like this with women'? Isn't that decency? - I have got lesser decency. In that case I'll tell him. You are frightened, isn't it? - Not that. What if he does something? I said due to that. I told you hundred times not to come. You planned to go with that sweeper, isn't it? Then she'll give a new idea of dropping a bomb. Out of tension I want to pee. You wait here. I'll go and return. No use of my waiting here. He is sure to thrash you. That time only I'll have to come to carry you. So it is better that I come now itself. What a talk of self-respect! You find out the way from someone. Do you know which is Antappan's house? What? Sister, where is vegetable vendor Antappan's house? If you take the right turn from here, it is the first house. Thanks! Don't call me as 'sister'. I'm younger to you both. No use of wearing silk sari. You should learn decency. I'm sorry, younger sister. Due to lack of culture we said so. Hello! - There is a person ready to give 25 for a cent. What do you say? Just because I'm in urgent need for money, don't try to rob me. Don't quote such a low rate. Shuck! There are people waiting to cheat another person. Who is it? - I came to meet Antappan. He is not here. - When will he come? You didn't tell who you are. - I have a necessity to meet him. What for? I'll tell that to Antappan. I'm Antappan's wife. What do you have to tell him without my knowledge? For the time being you need not know. It is not a good matter. What is the bad matter, that you wish to tell my husband? Your husband's behavior is not good. That is the matter. Shameless woman! What is wrong with my husband's behavior? He groped her buttocks. That's all. If you swing your buttocks in front of men, any man is bound to grope. There is nothing to fuss about it. For him to grope, you get women from your family. Are you justifying your husband's atrocity? Daily police is frequenting in search of him. Now women have also started to come. What kind of life is this, Jesus? Now I'm leaving. But I'm sure to take him with me. Children, don't come here in search of Antappan. If he was there, you won't be in a condition to even scoop and carry in a basket. There is a friend of mine. A dance master. He is waiting for me. I mean the master who said, 'He'll teach me dance'. Shall I go? Instead of this, tell Antappan to send some Gods pictures. Then you need not see. - Hey, I was saying gospel. You show us. Not one but many screws of that sweeper woman is loose. Listening to her words, you stop searching for Antappan by today. What if I don't stop? Hide the mobile. - What is it? Lady police. They are coming in search of Antappan. Isn't he that guy? Vidya, you, your iron rod and cement will be in lock up. Escape! Hey you! - Madhuri... Madhuri...stop there! Madhuri, stop! Where is Antappan? People are watching. You leave him. Tell me. By 10 o'clock he said, 'he'll come to the goods shed'. You go to the shop. - Why? Within an hour there will be a conclusion. So you need not come. You need not decide that alone. We'll take the decision together. It is more than one hour. Will he come after this? By now that boy would have informed Antappan, isn't it? Sure. I'll buy a water bottle and come. He is still alive. Finish him. Start the vehicle. Don't stop the car. - Chetta, please stop! Please stop the car! Did you do this? Don't stand here. Come...come... Chetta...Chetta... - What? - There... Who is he to you? - Nobody. God! Protect him. Careful... - Lift him. Slowly. Move...move... Move away... Hello! Yes. The person whom you called is now in the Medical College Hospital. If possible, come soon. Let's go. Chetta, how much is the amount? - I don't want any money. Do we have to wait here? - You can go. His friend will be arriving. On the way, we'll give the blood stained sari for dry cleaning. You say something. - No need for that. It needs to be burnt. - Shall I ask you one thing? Why did you save him? If he dies, how can I hit him? Keep it with that carton. I heard he is dead. Did you hear? Antappan was butchered near goods shed. Women should be like this. Tell me the truth. How much did you give? Is it 1000 rupees for one slash or 500? Madhuri! Are you hiding here? There is a person there to meet you. Call that Rosamma also. Sir, this is Madhuri. Did you take a person to the hospital, who was slashed? We want details about that. Both of you must come to the station. I'll leave them now itself. Should I send them with you? No need. They can come later on. What is this? When a person was about to die... - Don't help. If needed, you can take a selfie. This is the result of helping. Now you'll have to frequent the station. You should have allowed him to die. Now your life is also in stake. Do you understand? What should we do? Didn't you hear what that policeman said? Go to the station. Hey, I like selling uniform. But I don't like a policeman coming to my shop in uniform. So, tomorrow onwards you both need not come. Sir... What is the name? - Madhuri. Rose. Are you visiting a station for the first time? How are you familiar with Antappan? We are not familiar with him. Then why did you take him to the hospital? We found him on the road lying in blood. So we took him. Did you pass that way just like that? We went to a shop there nearby. Do you go out like this in the middle of the working time? No. Morning we didn't go to the shop. Is it right to leave a person in hospital and escape? Driver chettan told us to leave. So we left. Do you know who attacked Antappan? No, sir. - Okay, I'll call you again. You must come. Okay, sir. Hey, wait! Uhm... You...you wait. You leave. You come. Did you have any enmity with Antappan? No. - He'll die any moment. If some miracle happens and he is saved, we'll get his statement. In the statement he'll mention the name of all his rivals. Even if he didn't mention them all, he'll mention about one person. The one who was searching for him from one week. Whom do you have at home? - Only mother. Usually we policemen frequent the house and conduct the investigation. In your case, that won't happen. For that, we didn't... - I know you didn't do anything. I was talking about the method of investigation. You do one thing. Give your phone number there and leave. Hello! 'Policeman talking on walkie talkie' - Fine. It was Sheeba's call. She told us to come to the toddy shop immediately. Shall we take an auto? - Yeah. I suspect they are trying to frame us in this case. What did we do? We can't say what policemen will do. Is there any policeman in the list of your lovers? Any contract killer? No. For that, I'll have to romance someone. Won't that be difficult task? - No... Hello! - Hello...I'm Sreenath. Save this number. Okay, sir. - Okay. It is the Sub Inspector. What happened? - Not a problem. This is Chacko. He was a side kick of Antappan. Not now. I got married and became a family man. Chacko, you tell them the matter. There is a talk in the market, the quotation to kill Antappan was given by two women. But, the actual work was given from somewhere else. From where? Can I trust them? If you trust me, you can tell them also. The job was done by labors out on parole. Who? Is it the construction labors? The oldest criminals in the Central Prison are addressed as 'mastery'. On whose order? - Who else other than the SI here? Didn't Antappan thrash a guy in the market? He is SI's extortion collector. In the present condition, Antappan would have over powered the market. If he takes over the market, SI and his team won't be able to frequent there. So, they planned to finish Antappan on the road. For that only the criminals were set free. Even if chopped into 10 pieces, Antappan is the type to join up as one. If he remains alive, all those who attacked him will get killed. It's for sure! Doesn't this Antappan have any companions? As all the old criminals have been offered money, the full team is on UG. - UG? Underground. - Chacko... What should they do now? Whoever asks you, say you don't know anything. That's all. If Antappan dies, you'll escape. If he doesn't die, the matters will proceed according to his statement. Mostly he won't record his statement. According to his nature, he won't give. He'll wait till he becomes healthy. What for? - To attack with double force. You take care! What for? - Hey, girls... Why are you afraid if you haven't done anything? We are not afraid. We didn't do anything. This is the procedure. You need not know anything. The case will fall on your head. Else, a swing will come from somewhere and you'll be beheaded. That's all. You don't scare them unnecessarily. You proceed, I'll follow. 'I'll leave. - Keep this bag also and go' Why did you taunt them? That girl Madhuri... I doubt if the quotation for Antappan was given by her. Don't talk nonsense, Chacko. I did ask her casually, but she is not that type. According to her body language, I said so. Hey, once Antappan got laid, are you happy? Are you happy? Sister, don't shout at her when she arrives. Dear, why did police arrest you? Did they beat you? Don't create a commotion and gather the people. Come here. My daughter... Some time back, Bose came from the shop and told us. He saw a girl resembling you in the station. Is it true? Why did the police arrest you? Mom, one day a guy groped me in the bus. When I went to beat him, a gang slashed him. I took him to the hospital. I was called to the station to enquire about that. Women are bound to get groped in the bus by men. We must ignore that. I can't tolerate that. I'll decide who must touch my body. What are you saying this? - You won't be able to understand. I'm sure that I'll beat him one day. I'm waiting for him to come out. - Who are you to beat him? Red Salute, Comrade! - Very Red Salute! What happened? From yesterday night onwards I have been calling you. But couldn't reach you. Because of the nuisance of the SI, I switched off the mobile. Instead of crying, you tell me what is the matter. My life is finished. What are you saying this? Everything is over. People will say all sorts of things. Our life won't end due to that. Not that. My marriage has been finalized. When? It is not just like that you are crying. Where is your mother? For my immediate marriage, she has gone to give offering in the temple. Who is the boy? My Mom's distant relative. What is wrong, if the boy is good? His name and the place where he is working is not good. His name is Happymon. He is working in Saudi Arabia. Why are you silent? Is he in a good job? He is an engineer. You are a 10th grade fail and you are getting an engineer. Think about that. Go and get married. Then you change his name and call him with the choice of your name. Then you go with him to Saudi. My dog will go to Saudi. Saudi is not like before. It has changed a lot. Can I wear a low hip sari there? You are saying it has changed. You do what you want. Not that. You say something. I'll follow that. Hey... There is another matter. Yesterday night itself I got rid of 4 of them. But one fellow is not backing out. He said, 'Early morning he will come to meet me'. I'm totally tensed. Somehow you must get rid of him. Were there 5 boyfriends in total? Are you a 'Panchali'? Where is he coming from? From Chellanam in Ernakulam district. What is his name? - Nonnappan. Good! Different name. What is his job? - A marriage DJ. Oh God! He is calling. You attend the call. Tell him to come. Will you talk to him? - You can talk to him. Hello! Yes... Come...come... Come on man! Behind CMS College there is a cemetery. You come there. Are you going to bury him there? To get rid of this evil spirit, I want to pray to grandpa. It is so many days since we met, dear! Why are you here? - It belongs to my grandfather. Grandfather... Hey! - Yeah! This is Madhuri. Your friend? - My friend. What a friend! Wow! - Oh No! No need? What did you say yesterday, Rose? Should we get separated? What will happen to our dreams? Don't you want to see our children playing around? How can we get separated, Rose? Not that, dear? - If you plan to ditch me, I'll lie with these people here. I swear on our children! Don't say like that. I'm in a big trouble. Whatever may be the issue, I'll solve it. You tell me what it is. Madhuri, you come here. Tell him the matter. We are involved in a police case. What is there in that? There are 5 cases on me in Kasba station and 8 cases in Ambathur. I have got an advocate. I'll take care of it. You can go and slash a judge. Won't I get you released? This is not a decent case. It is a very cheap case. She got arrested from a hotel. For what? - That one... What? The other one...women... Women? - Trafficking. Trafficking? One minute. Rose, is she telling the truth? I don't have any job like before. We can get married and carry on with your profession. We can go ahead with our life like that. I won't have any problem. Neither you nor others will have any problem. What do you say? - Shameless bum! This is Kottayam. I'll chop you and feed the dogs. Get me? Rosamma! Did you hear what he said? You leave. Don't stand here anymore. Come here. There will be problem, if she loses her cool. You go. Chechi, is it the bus or train that is better to go to Ernakulam? There is a ship leaving now from harbor. You'll reach soon. Thank you! Hey... Think before getting rid of him. It's a great family. Daily you can go to station with mother-in-law. Hello! What is it, sir? What happened? It is the SI. He wants to meet me. It's Happymon. Do I need to come? No need. - Hello, Happy! 'From so many years he has been saying the same thing.' 'It's not possible.' Will his father pay the interest amount? Take him away and call me. Move. Hey, Antappan has regained consciousness. But...he is not fit to speak. After 4 or 5 days, his statement can be recorded, is what the doctor said. Then...there is another problem. If he gives statement against you, there will be a problem. - But I haven't done anything, sir. I know that. If he did say anything like that... is what I meant. Can you recognize the ones who slashed Antappan? Is there anyone among them? Who gave you this contract? We demanded 50,000 rupees. After bargaining, it was fixed for 25,000. Who bargained? Sir, not me. She owes us 5000 rupees, sir. - Shut up! What is he saying? Is there any truth? I swear on my mother! I don't know anything, sir. She'll swear on her mom and father. She is lying, sir. All of you go out. If they say like this, it'll be a problem. You need not be afraid. I'm there. As long as I'm there, you'll be safe. Isn't that enough? Why are you switching off your mobile at night? You keep that switched on. Do you know how many times I called you yesterday night? Sir, don't believe what they say. I have got no connection with this. What they said is enough to charge a person with a case. You don't get tensed. Then...there is a case against Antappan in the market fight case. If at all he gets bail... you take care. The minute he gets bail, he'll act. Then it'll be difficult to lock him. Aiya....are you scared? He won't get bail. I'll arrest and bring him here directly. Am I not there? Shall I give sweet? - We couldn't hear. Shall I give sweet? - We couldn't hear. Shall I give sweet? - Give it. What did you do this? You should have tried to get a job somehow. I... Will anyone give you a job if they come to know you are involved in a case? Instead of knowing later on and dismissing me, it is better they know now, isn't it? That we can see later on. Hello! - Hello! Where are you? It is my friend Rosamma's betrothal. Is your friend leaving you alone and going? Don't you want to get married? Tell me. In a way it is good to remain unmarried. You'll lose your freedom. Then...today I'm on leave. We'll go to the town. Don't bother that it is night. I'll send car for you. Why are you silent? There are people all over here. Say that. I'll send you a message now. It's a document most important for our case. You have a look and bring it. Where is Sreekanth sir's quarters? - Go straight and take right. Who are you? - I came to meet sir. There is a person here. Who is it? The thing that you asked yesterday, I have come to give in person. You can give that in station to some constable. You wanted it directly. Then how can I give it to a constable? You go and prepare a coffee. Prepare 2 dosas also. I feel hungry. No WhatsApp and no calls. I'll stop everything. Instead of troubling us tell where is the weapon with which you slashed him. Don't increase our work. Look at this as a rehearsal. We'll return. By then you keep all the weapons ready. How did this happen, Antappa? Does anyone have enmity with you? Can't he talk? He can talk but in-between it's not clear. Somehow tell us what happened. Do you know who slashed you? No. A girl was searching for you, isn't it? Did her men slash you? That...I don't know. That is the news. Do you suspect anyone? No. Then you don't know the person. I know, sir. But I have no complaints. Has the old criminals returned to the prison? - One guy returned. Satish has got one more week for the parole to end. Where are they now? - In Kasargod. Tell them to return before the parole time ends. Antappan has said, 'He has no complaint'. That means... he has got complaint. Leave that. You need not beat anyone. In that moment I said something. You don't get involved in anything. You don't know. You'll get killed. Hey, the one standing there is Gopi. I can't go alone. You also come. Is it Gopi chettan? Yes. - We are from the town. Studying in college. Some boys from Puthupalli beat him up. We want to give it back. We want to meet Madhuri Chechi. The sir in the station told us about Madhuri chechi. We all of us together have collected 15,000 rupees. Can you fix one meeting with Madhuri Chechi? We want to give it back to them today itself. Now itself we can give. You wait a minute. He is angry. Let's go. It's Kannadasalai. Get down. Now do you believe that Gopi is the agent for hooliganism? I heard he stole from the shop. After you left, 2 more police officers came. Now, two youngsters came to fix a meeting with you. Dear, life is not something for any stranger to interfere. Your mother is still alive for your sake. Why are you making her suffer like this? It's better to kill her. This can't be left like this. That day you were told about a boy from Ettumanoor working in a bank. That boy and the agent have come to the house. In the matter of women entering the Sabarimala temple... We must take a stand, right? I have seen you before, Madhuri. I know about your family condition. Your family is my family. You need not sell the plot. Your father is buried there and you have that sentiment. It's okay. We can pay off all the debts. We can pay off all the debts. What do you say? Before that, I want to do a small thing. What is that? - I want to whack a person. Why? - He groped me in the bus. Is that all? Thinking it is something else, I got scared. This is usual. I have no problem that a guy groped you like that. But I have a problem. In first night itself, Rose kept talking about you. She kept praising you. You eat. There is 'Achappam', 'Mixture'. You eat this. Here comes tea. Madhuri, she doesn't know how to send even a message in mobile. Leave that. She doesn't even know what is WhatsApp. Even present day children know about it. Oh...she doesn't know all that. You can teach her all that. I teach her everything. I can tell this only to you. She is a very shy person. Even to eat together... You be silent, Monu. You eat 'Mixture', Madhuri. This Sweetipie... You go from here. Allow me to talk to her. You come. He believes you a lot, isn't it? - Yes. Sometimes I feel sad. Then, thinking that it is for a good family life, I'll continue to act. What happened in the bank matter? After pleading with the manager I have got some more grace period. All those, who come to buy the plot are quoting a very low price. Are you looking out for any job? I'm looking out. But I must get, isn't it? If you won't create a commotion, shall I tell you one thing? Gopi Chettan called and told me about the boy, who had come to see you. If he is ready to solve all the issues, why don't you say okay to him? All your problems will end, isn't it? Hello! It is Sheeba. Antappan has got bail. He was put in your mercy, isn't it? Got punished him for his sin. You leave that now. That was given by God. I haven't given. Antappan is in which room? Is it Antony Joseph? - Yeah. Is it the slash case? He got discharged and left. The tenants here have left. SI sir said he'll call me, but he hasn't called till now. Madam, it has been a long time since I have been sitting here. Why can't you sit? Do you have piles problem? What is it? - She can't sit anymore. Then tell her to go inside and lie down. Sir... Two of the old criminals got slashed in Kasargod. They were found from the jungle. It looks like they'll die. Next it might be you or that girl, who'll get attacked. Sir... I'm not here. I'm on leave. Girl, Antappan's men have descended. They'll enter your house and kill you. Before that, I'll enter his house. It's an old man of 80 years. He may grope you. You just adjust. Sorry! You tell me, madam. I haven't come to book for a home nurse. I had gone to the boat yard to know about Antappan's whereabouts. It was Srank who told me to meet you. That shameless bum will say so. I don't have any connection with Antappan. I can't tolerate hooliganism. I'm a person of peace. SI Sreenath sir said, 'Sheela, don't have any connection with him'. That very minute I cut the connection. Antappan doesn't keep any dues. Does he owe you anything? I owe him. Chetta, is someone following me? A jeep is standing. A girl is pointing you out. Is she the one? Don't leave. Follow her. The minute she enters Antappan's house, you enter and kill Antappan. She'll get implicated. Antappan's men will take care of her. Okay? - Okay, sir. Chetta! Do you know where Antappan is? What about the boy with him? He won't get up in this birth again. He is paralyzed below the hip. It is because you were there that day, I got him atleast like this. What is the use of crying now? I told you so many times not to go for such work. Did you study completely? It is exam time, isn't it? Give it to me. Is it right to make her angry like this? What happened? Do you want to squeeze her? Forgive him. What did you get by doing this? Come here. How dare you do such a thing? - Leave me...leave... Stop! Where are you escaping? You! Leave me. Antappa...Antappa... - I'm not Antappan. I'm Satish. Antappan and Satish are the same. Rascal!
