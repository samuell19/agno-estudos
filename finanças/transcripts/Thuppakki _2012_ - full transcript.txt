'...12 men who have been shot are all sleeper cells' 'Neither the police nor the defence have announced their role in this' 'For the 1st time-' 'Each of the victims has been identified as terrorists' 'And there are bombs in each of their bags' 'The location of the mobiles used by sleeper cells...' '...cannot be traced even with the help of satellite' 'Sir, today our biggest threat seems to be sleeper cells' 'What are sleeper cells? Who are they?' Wherever terrorism exists they are found in abundance We'll never know where they are These 12 men blend and lead ordinary lives They are frustrated and want to take revenge on the Govt. They've been cultivated and their grudge misused by the terrorists After 9/11, no major terrorist attack has happened in America Only country that has found all sleeper cells and uprooted them The following men are the most fearsome feared terrorists Mummy...daddy 'Afsar Ali' Mummy...daddy Look, my daddy - Who did all this? - We don't know as yet Even able the police are puzzled! Any clues? The police have taken over all the evidence of the sleeper cells But the assassin seems to have taken the phone of one of our men Whose phone? Afsar Ali who was shot in Dhobi Ghat l don't know who you are Where you are You've killed my 12 men lncluding my brother l'm coming for you But once l get to you... ...l will kill you l'm waiting - Hello? - Come to Lakeview Cafe lf 'Sir' finds out, it will be misconstrued, madam Your 'Sir' is only calling you Come soon Why are you standing all by yourself? Where's 'Sir'? - Look there! - That's funny! Wow! Super! He got himself another girl? Hey! Shut up, da He's fixed that girl for you For me? He's already a problem on my head And now he has become a 'peddler' for you You can't say such awful things! Respect his age and marry him! - Come! - Where? Hi! Come...come Good morning, sir - Jagdish - Hello - Jagdish, this is Swetha - Hello Jagdish also came to 'bride-hunt' for himself But it didn't work for him Fate! We are in the same battalion He's my junior only But more like extended family l'm like a brother to him, no? No...no, l'm beyond that l'm like his 'uncle' (flesh-peddler) l referred you to him in the same way just now Really? Wow! Oh sorry! l forgot to introduce her to you...Nisha...my fiancee! - Boxer Nisha - Oh...hi l've seen you somewhere Correct! You've seen her somewhere is what you wanted to say, no? Even l had the same doubt the first time l saw her Then l remembered Jagdish How can l be his 'uncle' and not even do this for him! Exchange numbers Talk to each other See if your Biology works out Not Biology...Chemistry Whatever it is! lt's all Science, no dear? l need to talk to him alone Nisha! They should be talking You should talk to only me alone That is logic l want to persuade him about that girl Okay...okay Carry on! l get it Are you coming? Sir, she's calling me while you are here! There's nothing wrong with that, Jagdish She only called you when l was here lf she calls you when l'm not, that's when it is wrong That's when you shouldn't go Okay? Now, go! What you are doing is really wrong! The 2 of us are just starting to talk And you mustn't try to butt in and ruin it Do you know who that girl is? - No l don't...why? - She's a 'matter' What's a 'matter?' You don't know what a 'matter' is? Does your phone have internet? Yes Now what are you going to do? l can't go against my senior's wishes - He'll feel cheated - So, you are okay with her? Okay Jagdish...another 'matter' Another one? Talk to your family about this 'matter' as soon as you can and get fixed Then all 6 of us can marry on the same day That's my wish - How high is this wall? - 6 feet They are good jumpers - How fast did this bus go? - Maybe 70 km / hour They are good runners and expert swimmers as well All 12 of them were shot in the center of their foreheads A moving bus, a dark theater, a crowded market place Even if they were 200 meters away, it was a sure-shot from all of them They are trained shooters But they aren't policemen Any other similarities? No There's 1 more point But it's of no use All 12 of them were in formal suits when they shot our men What did you say? All 12 of them were wearing formal suits at that time You should have told me this first l didn't think it was a big deal lt's not a big deal if they were in America But in lndia, it is a significant detail So they were in suits They could be working in a hotel or businessmen at a board meeting Or software engineers at a seminar Advocates, or guests in a wedding l want a list of the seminars and weddings that took place... ...on 27th where people were in formals all over Bombay city You think you are a smart alec! Why didn't we capture those 12 men? lf we had them alive, we could've got so much information from them We wouldn't have got any information Because they'd have been completely in the dark! Also, none of them would've known that 12 others existed - ls it so? - They are all sleeper cells Their head...1 or few of them together have planned this Those who carry out their plan... ...even give their lives are these sleeper cells Even if we had caught 1 man we couldn't have got any info So until they get their order, do they lead normal lives? Yes...they might even wait for years There's no way to completely uproot them? Not completely but we can stall them lf we wipe out their head, then they'll wait for the order... ...all their lives and do nothing on their own That's okay but how will you find the leader? l don't need to go behind him l've made him come look for me l thought he'd come and attack me if we went and killed those 12 men l was right Wretched fellow! But how will he find you in such a big city? While killing those 12 people, we'd have left some kind of hole or clue He'll find out what that is lf we find out before him what that is... ...then we can get him before he gets us So think which route he'll take to find us Think! You have that strange colored box that you keep turning... ...like a coconut scraper Use that and think! Jaga! Don't pick it up lt must be her Jaga! Don't pick it up Promise on me- Hello? l have some shocking news for you You've started again? Not me, your senior officer has summoned us to his house...urgent l'll be right there Jaga! What you are doing is wrong! So much is happening and you're running behind a girl Jaga! Sit and think here l'm going to tell you both 2 shocking news First, Jagadish Swetha said she doesn't like you - What happened? - He's shocked it seems! Okay...okay...okay Before l tell you what your shocking news is... ...you must meet someone Wait a second...l'll be back Why are you laughing? l escaped from that 'matter', no? That's why l'm laughing Why did you laugh? Even a 'matter' said she doesn't like you, see? Chitra...! Come Wonder which website this girl is from?! She's my cousin My mom's brother's daughter Loved me since we were children But l didn't know about it Now she found about our engagement And suicide attempt Sit Then she was admitted in the hospital And it became a big issue l took a decision l'm so sorry l've decided to marry her l know how shocking this must be to you But it was my mistake for having encouraged you This is common in life Okay, now l want to ask you both something You came to Mumbai with the intention of getting married You wished to marry a military man So why don't you both get married to each other? - Siiiiiiiir! - Jagdish Don't misunderstand We were in love, yes But l haven't touched her with even my little finger Have we ever touched? No, we haven't Ask her! l know forgetting me will be tough for you lt was my mistake for being born this handsome Nothing, nothing - You are right, sir - This boy always does this Okay Nisha, all the best! - Bye - Bye Nisha? Just because you didn't get me... Don't do...what she did - Promise? - Promise Okay...bye!

Truly, the army is great For the next 11 months... ...you'll be holed up in a small tent in some snow ridden or desert area Sitting under the lamplight, thinking ofwhat happened these 40 days... ...looking at family photos over and over again...is your life, right? "Dear heart, bid farewell gently These fond memories weigh heavily" "Mother Earth, we bid adieu A distant place we trudge to" "Bonds that bind and separate ln me pain that pleases infiltrate" "We trudge, we track to a remote barrack" "Ties that bind...leaving behind" "Emotions in my soul enshrined" "See you...ciao?" "Friend's face walks on my heart's space Love's breeze also wafts with grace" "ln this journey precious thoughts will haunt me" "Trekking through hills and forest bonds of love will slam my chest" "New born to cuddle fondly l yearn avidly" "Waves a 1000 fold Memories in our hearts untold" EncOd3D By Ch3kUtHaN
