Hello, Mr. CEO. I got the gas tanks out of the flames. The factory's safe. No, no, no, no need to thank me. The job is its own reward. It always has been. What do you-- what do you mean two gas tanks? I know we don't make a face, Frederick. Now, hold it. Out of my way. Ahh! My ice cream! - No stress, people. - I got it covered. Whoa! See you. This is Super Lion. Whoooaaaa! His identity is a secret. No one knows who he really is, except for me because he's my dad. And this is me, Hedvig. For the umpteenth time, Hedvig. This here is not the bus stop. OK, from now on, I'll start getting my act together. Right, I've heard that one before. Well, my bus pass is in here somewhere. I just had to clean it. I got Nutella on it and some fish paste. Not from the same sandwich, of course. Though, the combination would be pretty interesting. Just take your seat, Hedvig. Hey, Thomas, we got a new follower. Really? Yeah, look. People really want to watch us play. Never thought that would happen. Wow. The other furdison from Iceland. Just what the world needs, more mediocre losers expressing themselves. Here's your pacifier. All right. No! Stop! Stop! No, no, stop! Whoooaaa! Ahh! Stop that stroller! What was that? Someone needs help. Runaway stroller. Child's play for Super Lion. Help me! Oh, look. Hey, it's Super Lion. No sudden motion in the back, please. Help's on the way. Whoa! Shortcut. Hm? Need this. Hey, I need that too. Oh no. Attention all passengers, this bus is about to take off. Repeat, takeoff. Someone needs a pacifier. It was my pleasure. Pleasure's all mine. Don't even mention it. This is a better angle. How about a group photo? Come on, folks, gather round. He's the best. That looked easy peasy. I could be the next Super Lion. Yeah, I could too. OK. - I - wish I could tell them. It's actually true. I will be the next Super Lion. The job of Super Lion gets passed down. My grandmother had it. My dad has it now, and I'm next. I may not have been born a full-fledged superhero. My mom always told me not to stress about it. I'd be ready when the time was right. A lot of things would have been easier if my mom was still around. She could have reminded dad about all that, and we'd still be a family. But mom's not around anymore. She got sick, and me and dad ended up alone. Dad doesn't talk much about mom anymore or about me being Super Lion one day. But when the day comes, I'll show him that I can do it. One day, I'll be the next Super Lion. From fish to lizard, from lizard to ape, from ape to human. Isn't it marvelous? And how do we do it? I'll tell you right away, by elevating the very best among us and weeding out the losers along the way. Like that. I'm fine. I dropped my book, and the chair was a little shaky. Thanks, Hedvig. That's enough. Now, what does it say on the board, huh? Yeah, uh. Tat lens. It says talents, duh. OK, let's settle down. Where was I? Right, to prepare you all for the Darwinist nightmare that awaits you all in the grown up world you're all approaching, the so-called life, we're going to have a-- ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba-- a wonderful talent show. Yes! The winner will get a trophy, right? And flowers, right? And chocolate, right? And lots of fame. I'll tell you what you can do right now. You can start out by checking if you have any physical talents during gym class today. Gaming is a talent, right? Not according to dad. Huh? Well, what do we pick then? Ahh! It's just so crazy that he's your cousin. What do you mean? Don't you find it a little odd that you're both family? Yeah. That was excellent, Adrian. You made me almost not regret becoming a teacher. OK, who's next? Thomas? Huh, huh, huh. Why are you laughing at me? He's got a hemp allergy. His throat blows up like a giant airbag, but it doesn't protect him. Oh, no, far from it. It actually-- Just stop talking right now, OK? You're up next, my dear little Hedvig. Oh, OK, it's easy peasy. I'll start with the ropes. On your feet, Hedvig. Come on, Hedvig, show us what you got. Oh. Let me just-- Thanks, Hedvig. That's enough. It was better than last time. I know, right? We can safely say that your talent won't be found in the gym or possibly any other place that we know of. Did you see Super Lion? Now, that person's really someone to aspire to. Today, Super Lion averted a gas explosion down by the docks. Not a bad day at work, huh? How was your day at school, Hedvig? Uh, just super. Glad to hear that. Do your exercises and read the manual? I'll call you when dinner's ready. Hey, everybody. Hello, here's a brand new episode of Heddy and Mr. T. And today's game is Skateboard Pig. Just remember to leave us a big fat thumbs up so we can keep on playing for you. Come on, Hedvig Wow. Pig's eye. Whoa. Jump over. Now, jump. I'm going to get it. You can do it. I got it. Woo! Hedvig, you get paid to do the laundry, but here you are again stuck to the screen. I just thought that maybe I'd do a quick workout first. Hedvig, come back to the game. The world is waiting. What did I say about gaming? Wait, a little bit, people. No, no, no, I will not wait. No, no, I will not wait. What's going on, Hedvig? Nothing. Just, just wait a minute. What? Why did you-- but you can't. The laundry, Hedvig. Now. But we have our followers. Four people are watching us play. Well, four this morning. Only three now, for some crazy reason. You have to think about the future, Hedvig. I mean, if you're ever going to be Super Lion one day in the future, you just can't keep doing this. But it's so far away. At your age, I ran an hour every day at the break of dawn. I mean, I ate three raw eggs each morning. Then went to school on a bicycle with one wheel missing. The seat was actually an old mop. I simply don't understand why you can't just go for a run. Just go for a run? What for? No one's ever regretted going on a run, Hedvig. You just saw one now. Hidey ho, brother. Hidey ho. We bought a delicious Muenster cheese. Mmm. It'll go perfectly with some shaved truffle. Oh, hey, I bought some fish fingers. Oh, that's just great, Leif. You can just eat them tomorrow. Hedvig! Adrian's here. Yay. Mmm. Have you visited mom lately? Well, I, uh, um, no. I've been very busy lately. Hey, there she is. We heard about the talent show. We're so very excited. There's a talent show coming up? Why didn't you tell me? Well, it didn't really seem that important. Ha! Talent isn't important? That's like saying water isn't important or money. Well, I'm off to go shopping now. OK, but how will you pay for it? Ah, with some rocks and pine cones. I really think it's high time that the school starts supporting all the kids that are really worth supporting instead of always conforming to the slackers. Adrian's only problem is choosing which of his talents to show. Which one will you choose, the violin? Yeah, or I thought maybe the piano. Rachmaninoff or Ravel, perhaps. Or one of your own brilliant compositions. Or how about acrobatics. Or naturalistic oil painting. Or even one of your magic tricks. Or a nice round of Halling folk dance, ending with a 7-foot high hat kick. The joy of talented kids. What will you be doing, Hedvig? Uh. Uh. Drumming. But you, you don't even know how to play the drums. Yeah, it's one of my games. It's so much fun. You get some flaming drumsticks and mega drums. And you start going boom, boom, boom! You mean a computer game? Are you still into that stuff? But it makes you lazy, sluggish. Our entire house is a 100% gaming free zone. Oh, it's been crucial to Adrian's results. What's going on here? Oh, so you like playing the great Super Lion, Hedvig? Mm-hmm. Time for you to go. Now, just calm yourself down a little bit, big brother. No need to get upset over a silly Halloween costume. If you're working too much lately and you don't have time, you can always get yourself an Au Pair. Out! Get out! But we all just got here. No, you're leaving. Now! Au Pair. No, no, no, no, no. No! You've shrunk it. You know what you did? This suit here is hundreds of years old, Hedvig. It's been handed down for generations. You don't have another one? No, no, there are no other suits. There's only this one single suit. Everyone's gotten used to Super Lion saving the day. The town can't survive without me. It won't. Everything will collapse. But look. I think it'll fit me. Don't touch it. Why not? You have pretty much sealed the fate of this town by, by just doing the laundry. But you always told me that I could try it when the time is right. Yes, when the time is right, which isn't now. Nothing at all about you indicates you're ready for this. Hi, Conrad. Have you seen grandma? Previously on Pensjonest Hotel. Agnus was the one who stole my waffle recipe. That's why I boiled her knitting. Hey there, Hedvig. Grandma. Sit down and I'll make you some nice hot chocolate. So, tell me what happened. That stupid Super Lion suit. I just shrank it. What? What? It's really ruined? I think it actually fits me. But dad says I'm not supposed to touch it. Hmm. But I'm supposed to be the next Super Lion. Why is he always so strict? Nothing I ever do is good enough. Oh, it's my fault, you know. That he turned out that way, your father. Why is that? Because that suit is a mixed blessing. It enhances your strong characteristics, but your bad ones too. If you're too hungry for attention, it can be a slippery slope. So that's what happened to you? Mm-hmm. I became too full of myself and I revealed my hidden identity. So I had no choice. Someone else had to take over. And Leif was the next one in line. Poor little Leif. He was only 13 when he was sent to Tibet. You sent him to Tibet? But what for? He needed some good old fashioned guidance. And unfortunately, I had been declared unfit. So we had to go to the Secret Super Lion School way up high in the mountains. It was a difficult time. And he never forgave me for it. That's how it goes, Hedvig. You get dealt some blows every so often. It's just the way life is. You just can't eat your cake and play bingo all the time, you know. But it ended well. Your dad grew up to be one of the very best Super Lions this town has ever seen. You think I can be one, a Super Lion? Well, I don't know. What do you think? What, what are you watching? Nothing Oh, can I look? Those people, they're not real. What we do is something very different. We? Since your mother passed away I've only focused on the job. And I guess, I guess that's why I never prepared you. I thought we had all the time in the world, which I thought until your mom got sick. Yeah. Do you want to try it on? No, there's no point. You know I'll just fail, right. No way. Look, the suit enhances the wearer's strengths. And unfortunately, it also enhances their weaknesses, which is why all the Super Lions have been extremely different. A lot of us get stronger. But my great grandmother, Albertine, got a lot smarter. Your great, great, great grandmother, Joann, got faster. And old uncle, Arnie, became spider-man. Well, he thought he became spider-man. Your mother always said that, that you'd surprise me, once I gave you the chance. Daddy, I promise you that I'll be the very best Super Lion you've ever seen. Get some sleep first. We'll start tomorrow, OK. Hey, Daddy, time to get up. I'm up, I'm up, I'm up. Now I'm awake. Now, pay attention. The Super Lion cave is activated. Wow. Oh, how I'll really miss you like crazy, my old friend. We've been through so much together. Dad! Yeah, here you go. I'm, uh, Super Lion. Mmm, yeah. Hey, ho, ha, ho! Incoming missions on Super Lion, Super Modern Fax Machine. All right, today's missions are coming in now. OK, a large great white shark has been spotted near the beach. That's a job for Super Lion, just not today. We'll save it for another day. The warship being at Hallstat, has run aground and is taking in water. The Navy will have to deal with that on their own. Uh, mmm, too difficult. Just too dangerous. Just flat out irresponsible. Hey, look, this one's just perfect for you, Hedvig. Tell me! A lemur has escaped the zoo and is causing a whole bunch of trouble downtown. This is the perfect first case. Well, I'm ready. Shouldn't we first practice a bit? Huh? No, no, no. Lemurs aren't at all difficult to deal with. Not at all, not in the least. Don't worry. They're just like cats, you know. Yeah, or baboons. Huh? Oh, you'll be just fine, Hedvig. Now, trust me. Any idiot can catch a little lemur. Remember, superheroes have to make a proper entrance. Woah! Hey, ho, ha. Huh? What do I do now? Go catch it. Mmm. Hedvig, go get it. Catch it. OK. I'll go and catch it. Fly! I don't think this suit even works. It does. You just can't fly with it. What? But why not? You couldn't fly in normal clothes, right? So you can't fly with the suit either. Then what's it good for? Look, mom. Who are you? I, I, uh-- Well, look at that. The town is safe. A new and slightly smaller Super Lion has come to our rescue. Someone shrunk Super Lion. Is that a Super Lion? It looks like a Super Chihuahua. Oh, there it is, that darn little rodent. Ha! Ah! The suit enhances what your best at. So what's the very best skill that you have? Oh, gaming. Yeah, OK. But besides that? Live streaming. No, I, I mean. Clicking like. Super Lion is not inside a computer. It's the real world that counts now. Huh? Uh, what? What's going on? Something weird is happening. Look, Hedvig. You've got it. Hi, cute little lemur. Come with me and I'll give you-- a banana? Now, go with me now! Ha, ha, ha. I gotcha! Ahh! Ah! Well, uh, let's call it a day, Hedvig. It's not going well. What do you mean? One needs a certain disposition to be a Super Lion. Not everyone can do it. Uh, but I only just started trying. Yeah, I know. But this was just a lemur. What if this was something really super dangerous? I have to find someone that I believe in. You can't expect me to succeed on my very first try. I didn't even get to practice. If the suit worked differently and granted everyone powers, then maybe. But that's not how the suit works. The suit just bases everything on you and your strengths and then enhances them. So I don't have any strengths then? Yes, of course you have strengths. You're just no superhero, Hedvig. Game Over. What's wrong, Hedvig? Are you upset? No, it's just-- Why am I so bad at everything? Why do you say that? You're good at so many things. No, that's not true. I really suck. At what? At everything. But you're not afraid to try. Not like me, at least. Yeah, but it doesn't really help me that you're so afraid to try, Thomas. I just suck as much anyway. Huh? Stowing away Super Lion suit. Alarm! Danger! Emergency fire! Tonight, Super Lion announced that he will retire indefinitely. Nobody knows the exact reason why he chose to do this right now. The problems are mounting in our formerly peaceful town. People are reacting with fear and anger. I'm furious! A house is on fire and the helpless owner can do nothing but watch it burn down to the ground. This would have never happened if Super Lion was here. As if our town didn't have enough problems, Little Troll Peak has started to shift. For the first time in her life, old Hjordis may have to move. How will our town avoid complete destruction without Super Lion to save us? Let's check in with our local reporter on the scene. Hey, wait for me! Huh? Stop, let me on. Look at this, Hedvig. I'm thinking of buying a webcam. Now that we're really going for it, we need to-- Look at that. Someone broke the Super Lion statue. I hope they catch the ones who did it. Hey? Hey, Adrian. There's something that I'd like to discuss with you after school. Could you drop by later today? Sure, see you after school, uncle Leif. Whoa! Your Super Lion? But why didn't mom and dad ever tell me? Uh, they don't know, Adrian. And they must never know that I'm asking you this. OK? Not keeping Super Lion's identity completely secret is reckless and really dangerous. OK? Do you think that I can really do it? Yes, I'm sure you can do it. Super Lion has to be quick, agile, strong and wise. You have everything that it takes. I know you can do this. Huh? Oh, Yes. Yeah! Great. Try something that you're usually really good at. Hoo, ha, hoo! Woohoo! Wow. Ha, hoo. There you go. Whoa. Whoa. Great, Adrian. But what about Hedvig? Thought she's the natural heir to Super Lion? Yeah, she just didn't work. That's no surprise. She's completely hopeless. Grandma. I raise you four pink ones and a purple. So bring it on. Hedvig? You have to help me. Don't worry, it's fine. We can trust this guy. He'll have forgotten everything by tomorrow, anyway. Hey, can I borrow $1,000 from you, my friend? I'll pay you back tomorrow. You know how the suit works. Can you train me? Oh, I swore to myself, I'd never touch that suit again. But you won't have to. I'll be the one wearing it. Mom thought that I could do it. She said that I'd surprise dad and the whole world, if I only got the chance. I just want to show him that she was always right. What about your father? He won't even find out. He's training Adrian. Adrian? That stuck up little whiny brat. That does sound dangerous. So that means that we have to find out when Adrian will be wearing that suit. Then we have to make sure that Leif doesn't realize you're gone. Oh my, oh my, Hedvig. This will be extremely difficult. Now, when do we start? Oh, thank you so much, Grandma. First things first, we have to attach a tracker to the suit so that we know when Adrian's using it. 1,9,9,4. Now, where are you? I know you're in here. There you are. There you are. Hi there, little mug. I thought I left you somewhere. I can't get through the day without you. Huh? Hey, there. What? Grandma. Now get on up. I didn't know that you had a motorcycle license. Well, I don't. Hold on tight. Here we go. Woohoo! Out of my way, you pesky brats. Before we can find out what you can do with the suit, we're going to need to discover exactly what your strengths and weaknesses are. Huh? Conrad, you keep watch, OK? Come on, Hedvig. Hmm. Where have all the good men gone? And where are all the gods? Ouch! You emptied the bedpans, right? Isn't there a white knight upon a fiery steed? Late at night, I toss and I turn. And I dream of what I need. I need a hero. Come on, a 1,000 more. Yeah. Woah. Adrian, that'll do now. Just calm down, OK. Conrad, attack! I need a hero. I agree, Conrad. It doesn't look so good. But don't despair, it's time to use our brains. You obviously don't have very many physical strengths, but everyone's got something, right. One thing that they're truly passionate about. OK, so what do you really love to do? Well, gaming. Uh, gaming? Woohoo! High score. What happened? Uh, I just finished the game. I've been trying for two months. And now I did it and hardly broke a sweat. Wow! Is this is your first time playing with a suit on? Hedvig? What's going on in there? Uh, I'm just doing my homework. This is just wonderful, Leif. You have to see this, son. What was that? Is Grandma with you in there? No, no, it's just me. I'm just a little hoarse. OK. Yes! What happened, Hedvig? Just tell me. I realized I can predict what will happen in the game. Uh, and even how to respond to it. So that means the suit lets you predict outcomes. That's just fabulous. You see both dangers and solutions. Yeah. So I think we have found your superpower. Want to do a new episode today? I don't think I can, Thomas. I have to help my grandma with something important. Today too? It's a little demotivating that you'd rather hang out with a 75-year-old woman. Sorry. Hey, losers. We only have two followers left. I really think we need to do something now. Show them we're a force to be reckoned with. Uh. Guess you're right. We can play Skateboard Pick together after school then. Yes! Uh oh. You ready? Let's go home and live stream. I'm so excited to show my new webcam. Hop in, Hedvig. What's up? I just heard on the police radio that there's a wild animal on the Trollfjord train. And no one can catch it. Yeah, yeah, sure. What about the new episode? It's really not that big a deal. What isn't? Gaming. But I thought we were going for it. You can't see the real world on that screen, Thomas. The action is out here. There's only one thing left to do, Hedvig. Burn rubber. Hey, wasn't that just my grandma? Watch where you're going! Calling all cars. We're following an old lady suspected of stealing a red sports car. Isn't this a red sports car? Focus, Hedvig. Focus. This mission is perfect for testing your newfound superpowers. Oh, no. Not a lemur, again. A lemur is nothing to be afraid of. Just some sort of cat or baboon. Any idiot could catch a-- Could catch a lemur. Yeah, yeah, I know that. When you're gaming, what do you do when you keep losing? Restart. Reboot. Reset. Anything, but give up. You can do this. OK, you little rodent, don't get comfortable because I'm coming for you. Can you keep the car steady? Well, what kind of idiotic question is that? Oh, come on, Hedvig. But who are you? I am the new Super Lion. You did it, Hedvig! The new Super Lion is born. The town is considering a full evacuation after fresh cracks around Little Troll Peak was discovered. Just wait until the new Super Lion's ready. Over to Trollfjord, where a smaller version of Super Lion has been spotted. Huh? Today a devastating train accident was avoided. Thanks to the actions of this little Super Cub. He introduced himself as the new Super Lion. I don't know if he was, but he did save us. As if a copycat could ever really replace Super Lion. It looks like we have a replacement for Super Lion. He can never be as good. And just as good. The talent show is fast approaching and it looks like it'll be the best ever. I hope you're all ready. I heard a rumor that Thomas will be playing the recorder. And Adrian will excel on his violin. I'm certain of that. Oh, and tuba Terry, he'll play the tuba, of course. What about you, Hedvig? What will you play for us? Well, Hedvig said she's playing the drums. You play the drums? Then we look forward to a fabulous drum show on Friday. Listen, we don't have to go to this thing if you don't want to. We both know that Adrian's going to win the talent show. Well, I'm ready. Right. Thank you for bringing me a long, Leif. Don't thank me. It was Hedvig's idea. Come on, Grandma. This is going to be great. Hidey ho. Hidey ho. A warm welcome to each and every one of you. Welcome! One of the most important things you can do as a teacher is to have faith in your students, and I do. Because talent can appear where you least expect it. So stay on your toes everyone and enjoy. Oh, it's so beautiful. Divine. Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. The joy of talented kids. Oh. That was just amazing Adrian. Who wrote this wonderful piece of music? Oh, I did it myself, just last night. I just threw it together. But I think I did catch a certain unpolished tenderness, reflecting the brevity of the moment in contrast to the transience of life. Mm, my thoughts exactly. I especially like the brevity part. Who gives this talented boy 10 points? 10 points! It looks like Adrian just mop the floor with the rest of his class, once again. Yeah. Including you, Tuba Terry. Terry, you can take off the tuba now. I can't. It's stuck. And it looks like we have a winner of the show. And it is-- Oh, right. I forgot about you. Everyone it looks like we have one more contestant. One more? Oh. Hedvig, are you sure you want to do this? Mm-hmm. OK, well, isn't this lovely. Wow, Hedvig, you really do know how to play the drums. Not only that, but you're super talented. Oh, listen to the audience, Hedvig. They really, really love you. Well, now, folks, I think we have a winner for tonight's talent show. There's no doubt about it. That's my girl. She cheated. I don't know how, but she cheated. You're a cheater! Ow! Can't believe this. I'll get you. Ow, give me the suit. It's mine. This is really exciting. So very avant garde. Be strong, Vera. You can do anything, remember that. Well, ladies and gentlemen, tonight's winner is-- Thomas. Huh? Let's hear that wonderfully winning tune again. Have the two of you lost your minds? What? Why did you bring the suit here? Huh? Don't you even understand what's at stake here? What were you thinking? Answer me. I wanted you to think I was good at something. What'd you say? I just wanted you to think that I was good enough. Well, no, I don't think that. The only thing this proves is that I was right all along. You're hopeless. I never should have let you try on the Super Suit. Hey, you just calm yourself down, Leif. You expect way too much of her. She's just a child. Yeah, look who's talking. I set the security level of the vault on max. So you'll never get your hands on that Super Suit again. Just forget that it exists, you understand? That goes for grandma, too. She can't leave the nursing home anymore. So stay away. With the sole exception of school, you're going to be grounded now. All right. If mom was still here with us, everything would be different. I, I wish you were the one that was gone instead of my mom. Not today. What are you doing, Hedvig? New high score. Hmm? An enormous amount of water is currently causing Little Troll Peak to shake and rumble like crazy. It could fall any moment and smash our little town to pieces. Without Super lion we're doomed. Our residents are panicking. Adrian? Yeah? It is time. Whoa. Hey! Will you stop showing off. We have a job to do. Stop being such an old fart, Mr. Leif. We have to get rid of that huge rock. No, duh, no, duh. I'm on it, yeah. Good. Wee! Woohoo! Hey, did you send out a press release about me being the new Super Lion? Uh, no. What? Why didn't you? What's the point of wearing myself out if nobody knows it's me. That's not why we do this, Adrian. Not to be famous. Uh, yeah, it definitely is. Super Lion's identity is and must stay secret. I told you that a million times. That's just ridiculous. No, listen, grandma's unhealthy need for attention led to her being declared unfit to be Super Lion. You know what that means? Get going, Adrian. We have a job to do. That rock could fall at any time. Hey, I have a giant scoop for you guys. Come to Little Troll Peak and you'll find out who the new Super Lion is. Come on, Adrian. What are you waiting for? Hey, there he is. Look! Ha! I am the new Super Lion. It's me, Adrian Bon-Hansen. Our town has a new Super Lion. He's introducing himself on Little Troll Peak, right now. Woohoo! What are you doing? Giving the audience what they want. That's enough. Adrian, come on. Stop it! That's dangerous. Adrian! You know which one I like best? This one. No, this one. The one with you in it. Really? Hedvig, you don't have to be a superhero to be super. Never forget that. Promise me. We're broadcasting live from Little Troll Peak. The new Super Lion is giving his audience a tremendous show we'll never forget. Is that thing safe? Relax, Super Lion knows what he's doing. Huh? Let's get out of here. Forgive me, Adrian. Of course you should have definitely won the competition. Forgive me, Adrian. Of course I would change everything if i could go back. Woohoo! What is he doing? I'm really on a roll now. Stop, Adrian. It's not really you talking, it's the suit. Woohoo! Yeah! Look at me. Grandma, are you all right? Yeah, I'm doing just fine, but Adrian's not. He's out of control. What? He's going to bury the whole town. We have to stop him. It's the suit that's making you act like this. You're a really good kid deep down inside. Please take it off. You're nothing without that suit. I am Super Lion now. Look! Look up there. Hang on tight, Hedvig. You little-- you better stop this nonsense immediately or-- Hey! Get off him. What are you doing here? What were you thinking? You didn't think Adrian would tell us about this opportunity? The kid's loyal. More than I can say about you. Mother? Just how could you? Carsten, just try and let me explain. It's just that-- Uh-uh, were any of you people ever going to tell me anything, at some point or ever? Yeah, did you think he was too dumb to understand? Yeah. So I've had every reason to feel really proud, but I didn't even know about it. Just think of all the friends who would have finally shown me a little respect. Oh, I would have told you if only I could, Carsten. Yeah, yeah, I'm sure you-- No. Adrian, my boy. You may be going a bit far now. Oh, please put Leif down, son. Just put him down. Stop it, Adrian! Stop! No one will ever stop me from being famous. I'm the best. Daddy! Daddy! No! Daddy! I just wanted everyone to think that I was good. Uh? The tracker! The tracker on the suit. He's down there. Let's get him. I'll come down. No, Hedvig, wait. It's too dangerous. I have to help him. No. Daddy! Wake up. Oh, you came for me. Come on, Daddy. We have to climb back up. It's about to fall. You're coming up. Hedvig! You find him? Yes. Oh, you found him. You, you saved me. Look, it's yours. You've proven yourself, Hedvig. What are you doing? No. I don't even want it. Why did you do that? It's gone, Hedvig. Super Lion is over. I totally suck at school. I'm even worse in gym. I'm as far from a superhero as you can even get. But you know what, that's just fine. I don't even want to be Super Lion. I just want to be me. Of course you do. Of course you do, Hedvig. I'm not quite sure what to do now. You can just be my daddy. That's all I ever wanted. Forgive me, Hedvig. Please forgive me. Oh, Daddy. Oh. Oh, no. It's going to break! We're going to die! Help, help! Oh, not again! What if we push the avalanche out of town? But how will we do that? How would I know what to do? Thomas, are you there? Maybe. OK. Now, look, our actions can save our lives and everyone who lives under the peak. Together we can do it. OK. Now what do we do? We'll just play the Skateboard Pig. A video game? Seriously, Hedvig? I just have to get in there. I'll send some pics of the mountainside. I got the pics. There's a diagonal rock right underneath you. Help me push. Come on, Hedvig. Do you have any idea what you're doing? She does. Come on. Push. How does it look, Thomas? A bit to the left, right there. Oh, it's all over for us. Thanks, everyone We're definitely doomed. You can do it, Hedvig. Woohoo! We've all been saved. Huh? We really did it. Come here. The Super Lion suit disappeared in the mountains that day. We decided it should stay there. Whoa, woah. And that there shouldn't be a Super Lion anymore. How's that? The time had come for the town to protect itself. And for us to protect each other. It was all a day's work. Having to be super all the time will wear you out. And besides, you can be super without being a superhero. Dinner's ready. It's fish fingers. You can simply be just super. Where have all the good men gone and where are all the gods. Where's the streetwise Hercules to fight the rising odds. Isn't there a white knight upon a fiery steed. Late at night I toss and I turn, and I dream of what I need. I need a hero. I'm holding out for a hero till the end of the night. He's gotta be strong, and he's gotta be fast, and he's gotta be fresh from the fight. I need a hero. I'm holding out for a hero till the morning light. He's gotta be sure, and he's gotta be soon, and he's gotta be larger than life. Larger than life. Somewhere after midnight in my wildest fantasy, some are just beyond my reach, and some are reaching out to me. Raising all the thunder and wrangling with the heat. It's gonna take a super man to sweep me off my feet. I need a hero. I'm holding out for a hero till the end of the night. He's gotta be strong, and he's gotta be fast, and he's gotta be fresh from the fight. I need a hero. I'm holding out for a hero until the morning light. He's gotta be sure, and he's gotta be soon, and he's gotta be larger than life. Larger than life. Before the mountains meet the heavens above, the way the lightning splits the sea. I could swear there is someone somewhere watching me. Through the wind and the chill and the rain and the storm and the flood, I can feel his approach like a fire in my blood. I need a hero. I'm holding out for a hero till the end of the night. He's gotta be strong, and he's gotta be fast, and he's gotta be fresh from the fight. I need a hero. I'm holding out for a hero till the morning light. He's gotta be sure, and he's gotta be soon, and he's gotta be larger than life. Larger than life.
