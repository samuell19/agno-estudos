Oh, Dear... Fix this dress tie on me, please, will you? If I were a commander in the Navy, I'd be ashamed to admit I couldn't fix a dress tie. Says my beautiful wife. Now, dear, if you're going to stop us, we'll never get to the banquet. Why do we have to go to these dinners anyway? That's the penalty you pay for being important. There. Thanks. Just the same, there are times when this hero business is debunked. From my last night, too. Why don't they stage these fool banquets a week ahead? Because it wouldn't read so well in the newspapers. Commander Hall was honored at the banquet a week before his departure for the South Pole. It sounds flat. Oh, I don't know. Commander Hall spent his last evening at home quietly with his wife. Sounds rather nice to me. [Knocking on door] Lieutenant Armstrong is downstairs. Tom. Yes, I asked him to come over and go with us. Oh. Tell him we'll be right down. Yes, sir. You don't mind? Mind Tom? Why no, of course not. You know, I wouldn't be half as keen on this trip, if it were not for Tom. He's as excited about it as a school boy. What are you talking about? Evening, Tom. Good evening, Commander. Good evening, Miriam. Good evening, Tom. You look perfectly beautiful tonight. I don't know whether I like that or not. You put too much emphasis on that tonight. To me, you're always beautiful. Leave it to Tom, to always say the right thing at the right time. It's a gift. [Laughs] Aren't you thrilled at the thought of actually starting tomorrow? I'll say I am. Let's take her along. As a mascot? No. As guardian angel. There you go again. I told you it was a gift. [Music] Ladies and gentlemen, I wish to propose the final toast of the evening. A toast of God's speed to the officers and crew of the expedition through the person of its gallant leader, Commander Donald Hall. Commander Donald Hall. [All] - Commander Donald Hall. Thank you. And now, if I may, I'd like to propose a toast. To the real heroes of this expedition, the courageous wives and sweethearts who remain at home. [All] - To the wives and sweethearts. Commander, we are all in this. Hall. Yes? How do you feel when you face an expedition? Is it something of the gambler's fate in the turn of a wheel? Well, frankly, when I think of Peary and Amundsen and Andre, and compare their attempts with this expedition, I feel rather humble. Humble? Absolutely. Consider what Peary faced. The odds against him were overwhelming. That's true. When you consider the modern inventions that we have at our disposal, this expedition seems like child's play. Child's play? Well, I should hardly call it that. No? Well, by way of comparison. Once those men started, they lost touch with the outside world. We have the wireless and base camps equipped with aeroplanes. Commander, if you could make a survey of the morals of the natives at the South Pole, -I'm afraid there are none, Doctor. What? Morals or natives? Good news, Sir John. Tell me, is it true your men are sewn up in their furs, and don't take them off until the end of the trip? Very nearly true, Sir John. My word, sir! Then how do they take a bath? [Laughter] With anything which is wet. [Music] Anything. Tom, tell me the truth. Since the plans were first made a year ago, Donald has insisted that there's not a bit of danger involved. Is that true? Why... Why, yes. Yes, of course. But there is danger, isn't there? A great deal of danger. You're not going to get frightened the last moment. I don't know. See, those women seem to be sympathizing with me. They made me realize that they were frightened. And that frightened me. Now, I wonder if I may be excused? See, I haven't much more time with my wife. Why Miriam, you're trembling. I am frightened. Frightened? I was sort of feeling that... Miriam... Oh, my dear. I'm sorry. Please forgive me. It wasn't your fault, dear. I couldn't help it. I forgot myself. It was my fault. I don't know how I could have been so clumsy. I'm delighted it happened, Commander. How I could... Everyone will be wanting a piece of that vase as a souvenir. Why, I'll be quite the most popular woman in Washington. Well, that's very charitable of you, but still I... And now I'm going to insist that you autograph every fragment before you leave tonight. Well, very well then... If someone will lend me a pen, I'll get to work. But at least take my mind off. Do you think it's hard? Has anyone a pen? I have one. Thank you. Mommy? Thank you. Oh, Commander. I love you. I love you. Thank you. Oh, that's enough. Isn't that enough? I didn't know you were getting me. Oh, that's enough. I didn't know you were getting me. I didn't know you were getting me. Good night, Commander. Good night. Good night, Lieutenant. Very glad you came. Mm-hmm. Well, best of luck, Commander. Thank you. Sit beside Miriam. What a come down. What did you say? Awkward, I mean, wasn't it? Breaking that vase? Why I wouldn't let that bother me. Well, it does. One awkward gesture, then smash. Well, your future isn't ruined with smashing Mrs. Talon's vase, I'm sure. I'm not so sure. Don't be silly, Donald. Awkward position to find myself in. There I was, the guest of honor. Lionized like a little tin hero. Taking it rather gracefully, too. And then smash. And that vase scattered in bits all around me. It was just one of those things that couldn't be helped, Donald. Nevertheless, one can't go to someone else's home and break a thing of value and not make restitution. Is that right, Tom? Right, Donald. Well, here we are. Home. Good night. Oh, not yet, Tom. Come on in. It's late. Let's all have a nightcap. I think I better be getting on. Tom, it's our last night. Come on in. Miriam, you insist. Yes, come along, Tom. Oh, Tom! How will you have it? Tall glass or neat? Neat please. I know what Miriam wants. He saw us. I hope not. Everything he said had a double meaning. You imagine that. I tell you he's playing with us. Oh, Miriam. He knows! I tell you. Here you are Dear. Well, here's to the three of us. What's the matter dear? It's my head. I'm sorry. Too much excitement. I'm afraid so. Let me get you an aspirin. Oh, will you? It's in there. I think the second shelter in that medicine case. I'll hurry. I can't stand any longer. Now Miriam, we're not sure. Oh, he knows I tell you. He knows. Then there's only one decent thing for me to do. Tom... What do you mean? Oh, you won't do that. Promise me you won't. I'm sorry, Miriam. Did you ask him, dear? Donald, why do you go on pretending? Pretending? Oh, why don't you come out with it? You saw us in the conservatory, didn't you? Yes. I knew it. I knew it. Now, Miriam. Donald, you must know the respect I have for you. You would never let me be guilty of doing a cheap thing. What happened tonight had to happen. Tom and I were helpless. Oh, won't you believe that? We, we were swept away. It's all my fault, Donald. I was a cad. My dear chap, I've known you all your life. And I have never known you to do a dishonorable thing. I'm sure it must have been something pretty big. To make you forget yourself this time. And now I think we'd better forget it. This is the last evening that Miriam and I will have together for a long time. Good night. Good night, Miriam. Shall we go upstairs, dear? But there's still something you don't understand. My Dear, I think I understand everything. Oh, no, Donald, you don't. I told you this was no mere flirtation. Do you think what you saw tonight could have happened if it were only that? Do you think I could have let Tom take me in his arms and kiss me? Of course, my Dearie. The emotion of saying goodbye got the better of you. No, Donald, it wasn't that. It was because I loved him and he loved me. Miriam! No. Now you understand. Well, what do you want me to do? I want my freedom, Donald. What freedom? You mean a divorce? Oh, my dear, I'd rather die than hurt you this way. Divorce! You mean that should you and I... -After what I told you, what's left for us? God, what's left? What's left of five years of hopes and plans and efforts... all rooted in my love for you? What's left of anything now? Oh, don't, don't, please, don't. I can hear that vase crashing about me again. Only this time... it's the world. It's falling about me in pieces. You think that the ice will affect it? Oh, I think not. Here, let me show you. Goodbye, Miriam. All luck to you, Tom. Thanks. Time to take off, Miram. I want you to be happy. Everything will be all right, and sure... --Oh, darling. I called up my attorney this morning. Anything you want done... They'll do. Come on, man. I've got to take you in my arms, dear. The whole world's looking on. Goodbye. - Ready, huh? - All right. Ready, Ron? Stand by the way off, ship. We are, we are. Stand by the way off, ship. - I'm picking up the Explorer, George. - I've established communication with the Explorer, sir. - Very well. - Hi, hi. We have interrupted Professor Jones' concert in order to give you an announcement eagerly awaited by millions. Dispatch from the dirigible Explorer. Now en route to the South Pole, carrying a band of intrepid men under the leadership of Commander Donald Hall. Dauntlessly roaring through uncharted skies toward the land of eternal ice and snow. The giant silver dirigible sends back word that all is well. The dispatch reads as follows. On board the Explorer, Thursday, August the 4th, 4:22 P.M., Eastern Standard Time. Confirming position recently reported, we have just passed over the Coco's Keys in the southern Caribbean Sea. Visibility splendid, motors functioning perfectly. Optimistic of complete success and expedition, signed Hall, Commander. Professor Jones' orchestra will now continue. - Oh, there, didn't I tell you? They're going along splendidly. - Yes. - But why are they flying over the Caribbean Sea? - They're going to the pole. - They have to fly south to get to the south pole. - South Pole? - I thought they were going to the north pole. - But then I never did have any sense of direction. - Got him, George. Must be heavy weather on that balloon. Sounds like the 4th of July. - Who is it? - Sam, Madam. - Yes, Sam. What is it? Beggin' your pardon, Madam. The cook and I thought you would like to know. They are broadcasting a message from the Commander. We heard it over the kitchen radio. - Thank you, Sam. - Yes, ma'am. In a message sent by wireless from the control room of the dirigible Explorer, the dispatch reads, "On board the Explorer Thursday, August the 4th, 11:51 P.M. Eastern Standard Time. Cannot confirm position last reported. Have been fighting terrific tropical storms since 5 P.M. Visibility very bad. Motors running full speed to offset heavy headwinds. Have not seen land for two hours. Signed Hall, Commander. Wait a minute, boys. Hold everything, please. Station W-I-T-I. Stand by everyone. Here's a news item just flashed by the Navy Department from the dirigible Explorer. Pass through terrific storms. Two motors disabled. Right fin damaged. Proceeding slowly south. Signed Hall, Commander. Got Gleason. Huh? Got Gleason the Explorer. Oh, he's early today. Must be way down the end of South America. Wish I was aboard. Yes, you and my mother-in-law. [laughs] Pass the base tank. Remarkable. In 15 hours, they'll be over the Pole. Wonderful. Boys, there we are. We're over the Pole. We're over the Pole. What did you get then? Just 4 words, sir. Snowstorm, bearings, unable and blind. Unable to use sextant. It looks like, sir. [phone ringing] [Knocking on door] Mrs. Hall. Yes? They're going to give a message from the Explorer. Yes, yes. Oh, yes. It's just coming in over the radio, Captain Russell. Thank you. Incomplete because two-way communication was not established. The message is, have been flying through blinding snowstorms for 11 hours. Apparently still over ice pack. Unable to use sextant or take observations. Ship losing altitude due to weight of snow and ice. Hoping for storm to abate, but in the meantime can do nothing but maintain full speed. Will keep radio operator sending steadily. Hoping you get all or part until situation alters here. Signed Hall, Commander. ♪ For I'm just a bubble of trouble and care ♪ ♪ ... that I'm getting there ♪ Sam! Bring some coffee to the living room. They're falling! Falling. Weight of ice on envelope too great. Despite full speed ahead, ship losing altitude rapidly. Only 300 feet above ice pack. Can see ice peaks plainly. Falling. Falling. Falling. Stand back. He's gone. I can't even get his carrier wave. ♪ A night of bliss ♪ ♪ But when the dawn is breaking ♪ ♪ A memory, that's soon to be forgotten ♪ Gleason's off the air entirely. Attention everybody. We've just heard from the Navy Department. Message has been received from the dirigible Explorer. She is apparently... Wait a minute. I'll read the message. It's incomplete. Falling. Weight of ice on envelope too great. Despite full speed ahead, ship losing altitude rapidly. Only 300 feet above ice. Can see ice peaks plainly. Falling. Falling. Falling. We're about to crash. [indistinct chatter] The Navy Department reports that the utmost measures will be taken immediately to ascertain the location of the lost zeppelin. And Commander Hall's base camp will be ordered immediately to explore the Antarctic for the survivors, if any. We are warned, however, of the extreme difficulty because the Explorer was not able to locate her position for the past 12 hours. We will now continue our station program. ♪ To have, to hold, ♪ ♪ To live for just a moment ♪ ♪ In ecstasy and then to be ♪ ♪ forgotten. ♪ Bob, drop your ladder. Aye, aye, sir. All right, men, stand by. Everybody. Aye, aye, sir. All ashore. I don't know where I'm at. Stand by, Mr. Cooker, as it comes down, boys. Careful. Watch out. Don't step on that ice. Join the Navy and see the world. I've seen a lot, but never anything like this. Hey, look at that ice. Just turn your eyes on it. I'll load the ship. Better get that radio out of her before she breaks her back. Yes sir. I've got just up along, boys. The gas is gone, sir. Four compartments torn wide open. She'll never rise from this ice, sir. How about the radio? The radio went out of commission, sir. Long before we crashed. Have it repaired at once. Very good, sir. Captain. Commander Hall's wife is on the telephone again, sir. Very well. Hello. Captain Russell? Yes. You haven't heard anything yet? Oh. Thank you. I'm trying not to worry. But if I don't hear from you, may I call again? Thank you. Goodbye. And the minute any word comes through from the Navy Department We will broadcast it to our listeners in. Thank you. All right, boys. There. The repair job is finished, sir. Can we get the base camp now? Yes, sir. If our batteries are strong enough, we can get them just as soon as our tubes warm up. We got them, sir. Look out. There go your tubes. And those are our last ones, too. And no hope of repairs here. You can't repair vacuum tubes here, sir. There goes our last chance of help by radio. Any orders, sir? How much food have we? I've cut down on our rations. We have enough for about eight days. We will split up in separate groups and go out over the ice in different directions. I'm sure the base camp will send out searching planes. It will make it easier for them to find us. Very good, sir. Try and cover as much territory as possible. Will you, boys? We'll do our best, sir. Good luck to both of you. Bye-bye. So long, boys. Now, then, Bozo, be a good dog and stay here until I come back. Bob will take care of you, won't you, Bob? Yes, sir. I told you, Bozo, go on now. Take him. Goodbye. Come on, boys. Let's go. So long, Bob. Hey Bozo, what's the big idea? Go on back. Go on, back. Why did you stay back there with Bob like I told you to? Go on, back. Go on. Beat it. Oh, very well then, if you must, come along. I know I'm right. I remember this place. When we came out, on Wednesday. Thank you, I got it. Ow! You all right, Joseph? [indistinct chatter] Bob, go on. Get up there. What was that? What was what? I thought I heard the sound of a bullet. It was just your imagination again. No, no, I tell you, listen. Look. Oh my God, he's going past. Stop him, stop him, I tell you, he's going away. Steady, Tom, steady. That that won't help you any. Watch him. He's going to make a landing. It was just a miracle that I found you here. I was just about ready to turn and go back to campus. Where are the others? Gone. Gone? We're all that's left. Oh. -- Commander Hall, and I'm Tom Armstrong. >> Lieutenant Wallace, sir. Well, I guess the first thing that you're interested in is some food. Think of it, Donald. We're going home. People, streets, lights, music. As far as I'm concerned, I'm ready to go now. I'm ready. Pup, we're going home. I'm afraid, gentlemen, I've got some bad news for you. What do you mean? My plane can only carry one passenger. You mean that one of us must remain here? I'm afraid so. It's up to you which one I take. The long straw, Tom, goes back. Your turn. Take him back. No, no, I tell you I won't. I'm still the head of this expedition, and I command you to go. But Donald, you don't know what you're asking me to do. Asking you to do. I'm not even thinking of you. I'm only thinking of Miriam. Her happiness is all that counts. She wants you, and you're going back. >> Don't worry, sir. I'll come back for you. I know you will, if it's humanly possible. There's food here to last for a week, sir. Thanks. Goodbye, sir. Goodbye. Oh, wait a minute. He won't take up much room, will he? No. Lieutenant Armstrong is now being officially welcomed by Admiral Townsend. Please stand by, and I'll ask the lieutenant, if he would come to the microphone. Lt. Armstrong, will you please say a few words over the microphone? Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, the hero of the hour, Lieutenant Armstrong. [SOUND] Ladies and gentlemen, the real heroes of the expedition are back there. 14 brave men who died in the frozen south. The last and greatest hero is Lieutenant James Wallace, who single handed, came to my rescue, and later returned for Commander Hall and perished in the attempt. So if there's any glory attached to this expedition, it really belongs to those men. I thank you. There he is, boys. >> Come on, I'll bring the bomb out of you. >> Now, easy. >> Come on, bomb. >> Give me a hand with your light. [SOUND] [SOUND] Why Master Tom, I sho' is glad to see you, sir. I sho' is. I'm glad to be back too, Sam. Is Mrs. Hall in? Yes, sir. She sho' is. Tom. - Miriam. Oh, I'm so glad you're back. I'm glad to be back, Miriam. Come. Sit down. Now, tell me, tell me just what happened. Everything from beginning to end. Please, Miriam, I can't go through all that again. Tom, you must. I've got to know. Well, we started off all right. And then we got into storms and snow. And the ship got overloaded with ice. Yes, I know all that. I read it in the paper. I heard it over the radio until I almost went mad. What I want to know is what happened when you and Donald were alone. And that aviator found you. Please, Miriam, not that. But Tom, I've got to know. The newspaper said that when Lieutenant Wallace found you, there were only two of you left, you and Donald. He told you he could take only one passenger back. Is that right, Tom? Yes, Miriam. But why, why all these questions? I want to know, Tom. I've got to know. What, Miriam? How it was decided that you were the one to come back. We were going to draw straws. And did you? Please, Miriam. Did you? No. Why? Why didn't you? Please, Miriam, don't ask me to tell you that. Was it because Donald wouldn't let you? Was that it? Yes. Why? Why didn't he want to gamble on a chance to live? Why? Because of me. Because he knew I loved you. That was it, wasn't it? He wanted me to be happy. He sent you back because I told him I loved you. I told him that myself. Oh, Donald, Donald. If I could only make you hear me. If I could only make you understand that it's you I love. That I've never stopped loving you. Oh, Donald, Donald. Miriam. Friends of Radio Land, stand by for the greatest news of the day. Where it has just been received at Lieutenant Wallace, whose reported loss has returned to base camp number one. Bringing with him the leader of the Antarctic Expedition, Commander Hall. Commander Hall's condition is serious, but it is believed with a couple of weeks of careful nursing, it will set him on his feet. On this auspicious day when Washington celebrated the return of Lieutenant Armstrong... - Did you hear that? Donald's alive. Alive! Give me Central 2-4-0-1 please. Captain Russell? Captain Russell, this is Mrs. Hall. Could I send a message to Commander Hall? I want to tell him that... I love you. I am wating for you. Miriam.
