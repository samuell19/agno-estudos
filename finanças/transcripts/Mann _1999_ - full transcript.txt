'' Who neither have any self respect. . . . nor know how to respect anybody. I hate your face. I hate the sight of you. Forgive me, please. I am very sorry for what happened last evening, Priya. Actually. . - Excuse me. Why are you telling me all this? I don't want to talk to you. Okay. Actually, I got carried away because of the situation. And that lentils, rice, Manchurian on your dress. That's why I have brought this dress for you. I don't need this dress of yours. Stop bothering me, please. Look, I will never bother you again if you take this dress. I promise. Okay. Then today evening at 7 o' clock in your room or mine? What? Then today evening at 7 o' clock in your room or mine? 7 o' clock in my room. You better believe that I'll be there. Good evening. - Hey, look that's Dev. Stop it. Let's go. Come. Hi. Beauty is like the moon, and youth like a lotus. Seeing you I will recite a nice sonnet. Oh, this fair body is sculpted out of marble. People who see you think they are looking at the Taj Mahal. You have recited a nice verse. - Thank you. It seems you have told it to a lot of girls. And you have also been very successful with it, right? What are you saying? I thought of this poem right now, just by looking you. Swear on you. It seems you are in a great hurry. What can I do, Priya? The ship is moving very fast. And time is moving faster than that. We shouldn't waste a single moment, Priya. We shouldn't waste a single moment. Come. Let us merge within each other. Elder brother? Father. - No. Uncle. Absolutely not. My future husband. He is alive. He is alive and also healthy. And if he sees you in such a condition. . . . it may be fatal for your health. Is it? I am sorry, but it seems like a good fit. Hey. - Well, this is my opinion. Keep your opinion to yourself. Everyone seems to think that it's a perfect fit. Do you understand? I have nearly understood. Have you ever cheated. A small mistake maybe? It took three or days, maybe three or four hours. No. I haven't. And I have no intentions to either. All right. Typical Indian woman. Yes. What did you say? No, no, I wanted to say that. . I am very happy to meet an honourable Indian woman like you. Good night. Jai Hind. Where are you going? We were about to spend the entire evening together. I was thought so, but I suddenly remembered my mother. And I want to sit in front of her picture and cry. Was it your mother or your grandma? What did you say? - I said, so sad. Come I will see you to the door. No, no, I will manage. - How can that be? It is the duty of every host to see their guest till the door. Come. Come. Come. Come. Okay, good night. Sleep tight. You got into a no entry zone. Come on, Dev, take a U-turn. You're game plan isn't going to work here. Did you get hurt? Is your small ego wounded, Mr. Dev Karan Singh? Oh, no, no. I enjoyed it in fact. For the first time I have met someone equal to me. Shall I tell you one thing? - Yes. Can we at least be friends? I mean to say that no hanky-panky, no pranks. Only hundred per cent pure friendship. Pure friendship? I swear on all the pretty ladies. Agreed? Agreed. Friend, I am very hungry. Will you treat me to dinner? Why not? My pleasure. Interesting. Very interesting. Dev, the way you talk about woman. . . .I don't think you respect them. - Wrong, absolutely, wrong. Trust me. I respect women a lot. I keep them here, up. That means you hang them in the air. No, no, up on the throne. But as I start getting to know them. . . .the throne slowly starts coming down. Yes, then it starts shaking, shivering. And then it falls down and turns into pieces. Right? Absolutely right. You could break someone's heart because of these pranks? Yes, many hearts have been broken. What can be done now? You have called me a friend, Dev. So can I tell you something for the sake of friendship? You win people's trust and then you break it. It is easy to win someone's trust. It is even easier to break it. But it is difficult to keep that trust. A true man doesn't breech trust, but insures its existence. Don't you think so? Excuse me, sir. May I repeat your drink? No, thank you. - Okay. You didn't answer my question, Dev. We have talked a lot about me. Tell me something about yourself. We will talk about me, tomorrow. Why tomorrow? We have the entire evening. We also have the whole day tomorrow to do just that. Good night. Good morning. - Morning. How did you spend the night? - Nicely. After you stopped bothering me. Yes? What? - Did you say something? Oh, no. But you were about to say something about yourself. By the way my story is not as interesting as yours. Well. I was 2 years old when my parents died in a car accident. I was raised in an orphanage in Pune. And when I grew up I started teaching. . . . music and dance to the children there. One day, he came as a chief guest to one of our charity programmes. Who is he? That person in the photo? Yes. After our programme he proposed. . - What? In the first meeting. . .that we should open a music academy in Mumbai. - All right. And I accepted. Then after a few days he proposed marriage. I even accepted that. That's it, Dev. My life is now an open book. Hey. That's just one page. Yes, Dev. It's a one paged book. Hold it. Hold it. Statue. Smile. Dev, stop him. Thank you. - Hi, Black Beauty. Hi. - Your camera is very nice. It is imported. Made in Singapore. It cost me $500. It takes good pictures. Let me see. - Yes, look, look, look, look. All right, how does it open. Look here. - Like this. Okay. - And the roll comes out like this. Hey, there is nothing in it. - There is. . There isn't. Hey. You have thrown my roll. I should have thrown the camera too. - Yes. No, no. Yes, I know, I know why you have thrown my camera. So that people shouldn't get to know that. . . .you're the two of you are having fun surreptitiously. But I will tell everyone about your four-day interlude. Hey, watch it. Hey, fool. - Don't come forward. Come on, move it. I won't spare you. I will defame you. I will tell the whole world. I won't spare you. - Hey, Priya, where are you going? I have seen what happens with you. But Priya, we are just friends. Mr. Dev even if you sit with a glass of milk at a bar. . . .the world will think that you are drinking wine. That's why I will go my way. And you go your way. But Priya. - Dev, please. Dev, go your own way. Wow. I have found my path. Hi. Hi. - I just remembered a sonnet seeing you, madam. Beauty is like the moon, and youth like a lotus. Seeing you I will recite a nice sonnet. Oh, this fair body sculpted out of marble. People who see you will think that they are looking at the Taj Mahal. What did you think? By the way, I am known as Dev Karan Singh. I know that. - By the way what are you doing in the evening? Nothing. - Very good. I have got something that you will enjoy. Is it? - Actually. . Hi, Dev. Hi, beautiful. How are you? Kamini, looking at you I feel that after you. . . . God stopped making beautiful girls. Thank you. My God, how I've missed you. Now you will have to see from afar. And now that rascal is tweeting with a cuckoo called Kamini. My Popat had decorated such a nice nest in his dreams. Yes, Popat's mother. Where daughter-in-law and me, and three, four more parrots. . . .would have stayed happily. But this foolish girl left this parrot and went with that crow. Yes and that crow pecked at her and flied. Stop it. What nonsense are you saying? Look, nothing has happened between me and Dev like you people think. Oh, yes. Every girl says the same thing after being dumped. Stop it. You don't believe it. I will just prove it. Yes do, do it. Dev. Dev, please come down for minute. No, right now. I am little busy now. Dev, listen to me. I have talk an urgent matter with you. Please. - I told you I am busy. Shall we go to the restaurant? Okay. - Come on. Let's go. Dev. He will not listen. He will not listen. Now that smart crow won't listen to your twitters. The poor girl has no other way besides drowning in a river. May her enemies die. I will marry her. - Yes, daughter-in-law. Take this Rs. 1 and 25p and accept my son. Hold on to it. . . .otherwise this might pas you by as well. The poor girl is eating her food alone. Priya ! Hi ! Priya. Priya. Priya, listen to me? You are running away from me, as if I am a ghost. You are worse than a ghost. You are danger. Danger. And I want to stay away from you. It has become difficult for me to leave the cabin because of you. People are saying terrible things about me. Forget about people. Listen to me. Come, sit here. Sit. Bring two coffees. - Yes, sir. Look tomorrow morning, the ship is going to halt at a beautiful island. . . .where there are flowing streams. There are fragrant valleys and it is very picturesque. So you want me to come with you there, right? Who is talking about you? I want to take Kamini there. So? Take her. Why have you come to me? You want my permission. Darling, I need your help. Kamini's younger brother has revealed. . . . my plans to his mother. Why did God create children? Why doesn't he send them directly as adults? Well, now her mother has stopped her from going anywhere alone. So, how can I help you in this? You have to fool her mother, and. . . . bring her tomorrow morning to the island. And you want me to support you in this evil prank of yours? - Yes. I am sorry. - Hey. Priya. Look, Priya, don't say no. Only a friend helps a friend. Friend ! Get lost. Please, Priya. What are you doing? Leave me. I won't leave you. - Dev, everyone is watching. Let them see. Dev, I have already been defamed. Leave me. I won't leave you. Till you don't say yes. I swear on our friendship, I won't leave you. Yes, I will do it. Leave me now. First swear on that person on the photograph. I swear on the person in the photograph. Leave me now. Yes, thank you.

I lied to you. But why? Because I wanted to amuse myself. And you would have left me after you were amused. Yes. You cheat. You bluff. I liked watching a great dacoit turning into a saint. And you have also seen the result. I have done this for the first time. - Yes. And I don't know why I did it. Maybe your talks are affecting me a little too much. That's why madam, you go your way. And let me go my way. Thank you for saving my life. Wonderful. Very good. Wow, Priya. You set the stage on fire today. There bound to be a fire with this fuel around. - What? What did you say? I was saying that we're stopping at another island tomorrow. Have you chosen anyone among them? No, Priya. Someone is waiting for me on the island. All right, so there is a girl at every port. No, no, actually tomorrow I am going to meet my Grandma. Ladies and gentlemen. This man, Mr. Dev Karan Singh is going. . . .to meet his grandma on the island tomorrow. Why are you joking, Priya?

Wait here. See, this is Dev and Priya's love story. Dance on the boat. One photograph free for every two photographs. - Absolutely free. Pictures of Dev and Priya's love story. He has come. Run. Run. Leave my collar. Leave my collar. - It was his idea. It was not my idea. - It was his idea. I will beat you, if you lie. - Shut up. Bring all our photographs. . . .otherwise, you clown, . .I'll put an end to you act. And listen, you fool. . . .I am not worried about my honour. But Priya is a very decent girl. I respect her a lot. Nobody will be worse than me, if Priya is defamed even a little. Now keep these pictures here and run from here. Come. Come. Dev, did anyone tell you that you look great in anger. By the way you look great even like this. Look these pictures. They are so nice. Shall I keep it? You are amazing Priya. Till yesterday you objected to be seen with me. And today you. . - Dev, people talk when I'm seen with you. . . .they talk even more when I'm not . So it's good that I am seen with you. Isn't it? Now, can we go to meet your darling grandma? Grandpa. I wish you would trust me some day, Priya. To tell you the truth, Dev. I have started to trust you a little. Can we leave now? Let's go. Come, Priya. Grandma. Grandma. Grandma is at the temple. Wow! This place is so beautiful. It's peaceful. It's so still as if it is some pretty dream world. This is the dream world, where my grandparents live. Both of them have came here to spend their honeymoon. That's when they decided that they will make. . . .a small house here and spend the last years of their life. Together. Grandpa passed away 2 years ago. And since then Grandma is waiting for that day. . . .when she. . Grandma. Grandma. My dear. My lovely child. I have seen you after so many days. My sweet little baby boyfriend. My sweet little old girl friend. I am so happy to see you. She. . She is my daughter-in-law to-be? No, no, grandma. It's not her. She is my friend. Come. I will introduce her to you. Come, Granny. Careful. Granny, this is Priya. And Priya this is grandma. Live long, dear. Grandma thought that you are my future. . Actually I wanted to say that you are very beautiful. Grandma, this place of yours is beautiful. I feel like spending my whole life here. Don't say that, dear. This place is great for reminiscing and relaxing. But you have to cerate memories before you come here. Grandma, your temple seems to be very beautiful. Can I go and see? - Why not, dear? Go. And you, Dev. . . . how many years has it been since you visited a temple? Granny, I. . - Go, God will not eat you up. Go. 'So much innocence. So much simplicity. ' 'It seems as if some fairy has come down from the sky. ' Yes, did you say something? No, no. That. . Pray quietly. Coconuts from the farm, ma'am. - Leave all that. Do you know who has come? - Who has come, ma'am? Dev, dear has come. - Dev, dear. Hi, Ajinomoto. How are you? - I am fine, sir. And how is your family planning? It's not family planning, Dev. Say upbringing. Is it? Why? - I will tell you. It's the same Indian hypocrisy here. They consider girls to be goddesses. In spite of that boys are always preferred. For one boy, they had 1 1 girls. Even this time? - Twins. Well done. Grandma, I will go and meet his family. You guys chat. Come, dear. - Come on, Ajinomoto. - Come. Come. Grandma, Dev painted this? Yes, I remember clearly. While giving me this painting. . . . Dev narrated a story as thought I was a small girl. . . . he was my Grandpa. Give it to me, Grandma. I will apply it. - No, no. Of course, not. No. Give it to me, Grandma. When will I get such a chance again? Give it to me, please. All right, here. Spoil me. . Take. Grandma, shall I tell one thing? - Yes. I was surprised to know that Dev knows so much about the scriptures. Is it? - Yes. Then you will be more surprised to learn that. . . . Dev writes very good poetry too. He always excelled in studies. It was his bobby to learn new languages, meet new people. Is it? - In his childhood he used to amuse everyone. . . .with his tactics and skills. That's it, dear. The problem is his mind wavers a lot. It doesn't stay put at one place. . . .with one thing or one person. It seems like he is searching for something. The path that he's on scares me. When life claims its debts, Dev won't be able to pay up. But my heart says that if he gets a girl. . . .who would love him truly. . . .show him the right way. . . .then my Dev can change. Things can happen for him. Isn't it? Yes, Grandma, these anklets of yours are very beautiful. You like them? - Yes. One day I will send them to you. No Grandma, there is no need. . - Why not? I gave you a chance to serve me. Why won't you give me a chance to shower my love. Sorry, Grandma. I made a mistake. Now look, don't move. Here, Dev has come. Come, dear. Come. Come, come. We were not talking anything special. Granny was relating stories from your childhood. - Is it? What did you say, grandma? Grandma was saying that when your wishes were not. . . .fulfilled in your childhood then you used to. . . . lie on the ground and make your face red, crying. - Is it? And what did you say? I was saying you don't do this now. Now, when your wishes are not fulfilled, only your ego is hurt. Right? Ego is hurt? What do you mean? Nothing, Grandma. She's in the habit of talking in riddles. Now leave and take this. A small gift for you. No, dear. It's not my age to accept gifts. Just accept it, Grandma. Your youth will return. Is it? In that case I will have to accept it. Let's see. This is his Grandpa. His face is so bright. How did you make this picture? The face was in my mind, I just put it on canvas. I told my Dev is very skilled. Tell me the truth, Grandma. How do you like this picture? Dev, if pictures could speak, then this picture would smile. Priya. - Yes. Let's leave Granny alone with Grandpa for a while. - Sure. Come. Was it necessary to pull my leg in front of Grandma? I was not pulling your leg. I was pulling your ear. I am sorry. If you felt bad, I'm sorry. By the way, may I say something, Dev? The first time I met you. . . .I took you to be a crook. You don't have a heart in your chest. I used to see only darkness in you. But. . But after coming here. . . .and getting to know you. . . .I can see a flame of goodness inside you. . . .which is burning. It is bright. A flame doesn't burn on it's own, Priya. There has to be someone to light it. ''Life tolerates joy and sorrows, but still she keeps quiet. '' ''Up till now nobody has been able to figure out the meaning of life. '' ''She tolerates joy and sorrows, but still she keeps quiet. '' ''Up till now nobody has been able to figure out the meaning of life.

'' ''But still she keeps quiet. - But still she keeps quiet. '' ''Till now nobody has known. - Till now nobody has known. '' ''What life. . - What life speaks?'' It is time for you to leave, dear. Don't be sad, Grandma. I will come back soon. Granny, if you came to my wedding. . You know my dear. . . .I don't leave this island. But my blessings will be always with you. Granny. May God give you every happiness in life. Give you your chosen life partner. Keep you away from every evil. Keep you away from every evil. Fill this vermillion. . . . in the parting of my future daughter-in-law's hair. See you my sweet little baby boyfriend. See you my beautiful old girl boyfriend. Grandma, I don't feel like leaving this place. Everything is so beautiful. So beautiful. Do you know why this place is so beautiful, dear? We was designed from the heart. Here. . We had dreamt to make our small world here. When we thought about it, we thought it to be impossible. But my heart said that this dream will be fulfilled. And it was fulfilled. Shall I tell you one thing, dear? This mind can confuse us. But the heart, the heart never cheats. Always listen to your heart, dear. You will only achieve happiness in life.

Where will you go for your honeymoon? Wherever you go. Don't do this. Otherwise your wife will think that you are following me. You followed me that day on the island. Why did you follow me, Priya? Answer me, Priya. Tell me. Priya. I'll wake up tomorrow and it won't be like this never existed. I want to make this moment the most important one of my life. I want to make you mine, Priya. Right now. At this moment. In the middle of the sea. The moon and the stars will bear witness. The waves of the sea will bless us. There will be nothing for miles. . . .except the emotions of 2 lovers. Their infinite love. No. No. No. Listen to me, Priya. I want to tell you something. I don't want to talk to you.

I am surprised why it took you so long to tell me what is in your heart. The wedding celebrations have started. Are you mad? Don't you understand that my happiness lies in yours. That's why without telling you, I have invited them here. What? Look there. Hello. - Congratulations. Priya, you've proved to be very selfish. You have forgotten us after you have met Raj. Or what? - Or what? Raj came to the orphanage and invited us for the wedding, isn't it? Yes, Priya, I can never forget the respect and honour. . . . Raj has given us. The way you have treated people from the orphanage. . What are you saying, Mrs. Patil? You are Priya's family. And Priya's family means my in-laws. And I can't get married without the bride's family. Hey, you. . . .why are you missing a chance to make your brother-in-law dance. Uncle. - Quickly take your brother-in-law to the floor. Quickly. - I am coming. I am coming. ''Meets in dreams.

Before taking any decisions. . . .you should meet your childhood friend, Madhu. Madhu? But she is in Bangalore with her husband. No, she has come back to the orphanage forever. Madhu. Madhu. I am Priya. Priya. Yes, I am Priya. Aunt, what has happened to her? Someone saw her wandering in Bangalore station. Reported to us. We went and brought her to the orphanage. But her husband? Her in-laws? Her husband left her for some other girl. The doctor says she has completely lost her mental balance. She has even tried to commit suicide many times. If you sacrifice everything for somebody. . . .and suddenly he comes and tell you. . that he's leaving you forever. That can make anyone crazy. Even you. Even Raj. Take her away. You want to break the wedding. But do you know the consequences? Will Raj be able to bear this shock? You want the same thing to happen to Raj that Madhu went through. He should also die several deaths thinking about you. Piya, I agree that your joy lies in your love. But don't you think that. . . . it is duty to sacrifice your love. . . .for the sake of Raj's happiness. Now you have to decide. Do you want to side with love or duty? Remember one thing, dear. If you leave Raj. . . . no decent boy will. . . .dare marry a girl from the orphanage. He won't dare. 'Dear Dev, forgive me. ' 'Because I won't be able to come to meet you. . . .as promised at the Gateway on 14th of February. ' 'Don't think that my love for you has ended. ' 'But I won't be able to pay Raj back my entire life. ' 'For a girl, her husband is God. ' 'But I am going to make my God my husband. ' 'Forgive me. ' Dev. Dev. Dev. Dev. - What happened? I have sold your woman, for 50,000. Is it? And what about the other one? I will sell her too. I will take a total of Rs. 100,000 for that damsel. Shameless, rogue. Broker. Hey, why are you slapping him ? People should break the skull of a person like you. . . .and make skull park. Skull park. If you sell the woman again, I will put all your teeth in your hand. Understand. Scoundrel. Rogue. Come, Sheru. He is ruined. You are. . Why are you laughing? I am going home. All right, go. Why, friend, why are you staring? Selling woman means, he has sold a picture of a woman. Picture. That means you are a painter. - Yes. Then what are you doing here? - Earning money. I paint paintings all night at home. And paint hoarding all day here. When do you sleep? I was sleeping till now, friend. But I have woken up now. Either you are mad or a lover. I am both. A mad lover. Now I understand. Raj. You are here so early in the morning. Not early, but at right time. Come, sit here. Priya we will become husband and wife in the next two days. We will be married to each other. I want no secrets between us. If we get to know about things later, it may cause us pain. Now listen properly to what I am going to tell you now. When you went to Singapore. . . .I met Maya in one of the seminars in London. In the first meeting became friends. And I don't know when, but gradually friendship developed into love. And when I felt it, I remembered you. I said, I am going to get married to you and. . I told her to forget me forever. Hearing this, Maya's heart broke. But. . Priya, was what I did right? No, Raj, you didn't. If you love Maya then you should go to her. You should carry on your love Raj. . . . because nothing is greater than love. Then why are you coming to marry me and turning down Dev's love? Thank God, Dev doesn't live at this address anymore. And this letter written by you came into my hands otherwise. . Are you mad Priya? The man who left the entire world for you. . . .you are telling him to forget you. Why, Priya? Why? Why? Just because you think that I have been good to you. I am sorry, Priya. I am sorry. Even though you regard me as God. . . . in reality you don't even think of me as a friend. No, Raj, no. I. . - What no, I? Priya, friends never bestow favours on friends. You have built this academy, this house. . . .everything with your own ability. You have insulted your art, your skills. . . .and even our friendship by calling it a favour. Even if the world says that you are bound by favours. . . .even then your goal is only Dev. Because really there is nothing more than love. 14th of February, right? You will surely go to meet Dev on the 14th of February. You will certainly go. And I will be bid farewell from here. Raj. . I. . I. . Your favours. . Wow. You made it, friend. You made it. See this. Your own, your own house bought by your own earnings. It's unbelievable. Friend, It's unbelievable. Today I have realised that true love has great strength. I am proud of you, my friend. I am proud of you, my friend. That's why, we have given him the tile of The King of Lovers. Sir, do you recognise me? No. Moon TV, N . D. Shrivastav. Interview. Interview. Singhania's punch. Remember. Remember. You remembered me now. Sorry. I need an interview from you. Look, I don't want to do all this. No, sir. Please, please. Don't say no, sir. All the lovers in the world look up to you as their idol. Tomorrow is the 14th of February, Valentine's day. What is Valentine's day? It's the Id, Diwali and Christmas for lovers? Sir, if you give a small message on this auspicious day. . . .everyone will be happy sir. Sir, please, please. - I am sorry. Hey, speak, speak. - Move your hand. - Sorry. Dev, give him the interview. He will keep on speaking if you don't. All right, ask me quickly what you want to ask. Thank you. Thank you. Camera. Quick. Quick. Look, oh sorry. Look, consider the camera to be on when the red light is glowing. The red light is glowing. - Oh, yes. The red light. Thank you. Friends. Today on eve of Valentine's day, we will make you meet. . . .the renowned Casanova, who turned sincere. Mr. Dev Karan Singh. Mr. Dev you have achieved your dreams in these six months. Now what do you want from life? Tomorrow we will become one forever. I just want her to bring a lot of love for me. Even the shadow of sorrow should stay away from us. Only happiness and happiness. And now Mr. Dev tell us the name of that lucky girl. . . .who will be bringing happiness to your life. The name of that innocent girl is Priya. I love you, Priya. I love you. I love you too, Dev. Wow, teacher said, I love you. So what? My papa also says I love you every day. To your mother? - No, to the aunt next door. Hey. Teacher, teacher, what is love? The thing which happens to a 16-year-old girl. . . .when she sees a 1 7 year-old-boy. That's known as love. Teacher, teacher, make me 1 7 years old too. I want to love too. With whom? With Madhuri Dixit. Why? Because she dances very nicely. Shut up. Teacher's heart is thumping today. Tomorrow is teacher's wonderful day, isn't it, teacher? Yes, children. Tomorrow is the biggest day of my life. Because tomorrow I am going to meet my Dev. 14th of February, here I come. ''Tinak tin tana, play that tune?'' ''I dance dhinak dhin.

'' ''No matter what punishment this life gives. '' ''Why doesn't the one who goes far, come back?'' ''Someone tell me why does this happen?'' Grandma. Grandma. Dev dear, forgive me, we couldn't wait for you. Because it would take four to five days for you to come. No problem. I understand.

Sunny is singing the wrong lyrics Sing, hope is on your mind. What does mind mean? It's a place where feelings are hidden. We hide a lot of love in there. . . .for our mummy, our papa. But you don't have parents, so is your heart empty? No, dear. There is someone else. Whose love I have hidden in my heart. Who is that someone? There is a prince. A very adorable prince. Prince. A prince like the one in the tale of Cinderella. Yes, absolutely like that. All right, so you are Cinderella. Then in the end you will eat, drink and be merry forever. If God wishes. No, teacher you won't live happily forever. Why? But how will the prince recognise you. . . .when he will bring your lost shoe? You don't even have legs. Stupid boy. You have hurt the teacher. I am sorry, teacher. I have hurt you. No, Jay. You are right. I will never get my prince. No, no, you will get him. You will surely get your prince. We all will pray. ''We will be successful. We will be successful. '' ''We will be successful, one day. '' ''We have belief in our heart. We have total belief. '' ''We will be successful, one day. '' Hello. - Dev sir, this is Jaspal speaking. No, no, not Jaspal Bhatti, Jaspal Sandhu, your agent. Yes, tell me, Jaspal. - One of your paintings, Mann. . . .a girl wants to buy it. You know that that painting is not for sale, Jaspal. Sir, I explained it to her, but she's insisting. She is sitting and praising the painting. She says, this is not a painting. It is moment. I don't know, she said it's a relationship. And I don't know, what she was saying. Yes, it is the picture of someone's love. Who is this girl? - I don't know. It is some lame girl. I think, she doesn't even have much money. I will do this, I will quote a high price. She will run as soon as she hears the price of the painting. No. Give her the painting. Give her. For how much? No, don't take money from her. Just give it away. For free? - Yes. And tell her the painter has said thank you. At least there is someone. . . .who understands the emotions hidden in the painting. All right. As you wish. Okay. Dev. See this. See, what is in my hand. Two tickets of a super hit drama. It is a drama which will do away with all your problems. Come. Come. Come. Come. Get ready quickly. No, I don't want to go. Is it? Then take, tear the tickets. Nattu. . - No, no, tear them. Who I am to you? Why will you come for me? I am not your friend. I am your secretary, your servant, your crony. You will not come to see a drama with me even if it pleases me. Let friendship go to hell and these tickets too. You will be happy if I went along? - Very much. Then let's go. That is the spirit. Come. Let us get ready quickly. We will go quickly. Suraj, I know that it will hurt if you hear what I have to say. But destiny has decided. . . .that we should get estranged forever. Get separated for ever. Kiran, either you say that you will never leave me. . . .or tell me that I should die. Because I cannot live for a single moment without you. Why don't you understand, Suraj? Our union is impossible. But why? What is the problem, Kiran? Is something lacking in my love? No. Then why do you want to go away from me. Why? Don't ask me anything. It will pain you when I tell you and it's painful for me to narrate. Forget that you have ever loved someone. Forget that you ever felt true love for someone. Forget me, Suraj. Forget me. ''I have loved you. I will love you always. '' ''Even if I die, the love in my heart won't lessen. '' ''I shed tears when I remember you. '' ''Every time they say, that we will be united. '' ''What is this life? It is just your story. '' ''It is just your story. This life of mine. '' ''I have loved you. I will love you always. '' ''Even if I die, the love in my heart won't lessen. '' ''Those talk of yours. Those customs of affection. '' ''Were the promises and all were false?'' ''Darling, is it true. Just tell me that. '' ''The moment of love should not break. '' ''Give me some return of my waiting. '' ''I have loved you. I will love you always. '' ''Even if I die, the love in my heart won't lessen. '' ''I am only yours. '' ''Take whatever promise you want to. '' ''Oh my darling, give me your sorrows. '' ''I will have to tolerate the grief of separation my whole life. '' ''My goal has been lost on the roads. '' ''My problems will end only with me. '' ''I have loved you. I will love you always. '' ''Even if I die, the love in my heart won't lessen. '' ''You are in front of me, then why is this distance?'' ''How can I tell you my problem?'' ''Is this a life? Only shedding tears. '' ''Only shedding tears. Is this a life?'' What is the matter, Priya? Shall I bring you some water? No. - Sure? Hello. Raj. Priya, I will tell Dev everything, today. No, Raj. You will do nothing of that sort. I am sorry, Priya. I won't stay silent now. I will tell him the truth. - No, Raj. Raj. Raj, please wait. For God's sake don't do this, Raj. Listen to me, Raj. Raj. For God's sake don't do this, Raj. Raj, please come back. Raj. Raj, listen to me, Raj, Priya. Priya, Priya are you all right, Priya? You will never tell him. You have taken an oath. You have taken an oath on our friendship Raj. Please Raj. Please Raj. You are angry with me? Oh, no, I am fine. I am your friend. Your oath has silenced me. So now I am silent. Now I don't want to argue on this. It's over and done. Shall I ask you one thing, Raj? May God forbid, if this accident had happened to you. . . .what would you have done? Tell me, Raj, what would you have done? You would have allowed yourself to become. . . .a burden on someone? I know, Raj, you are upset with me. But no problem, if not in this birth. . . . Dev and I will surely meet in our next birth. The world is based on hope. Isn't it? Dev, all this. . Where are you going? Grandma's house. - For how many days? Forever. - What? Have you gone mad, Dev? A new life is inviting you in and you. . Dev, now you have become a great artist. Well-known art critics don't get tired of praising your art. Success is kissing your feet, my friend and you. . You are talking about leaving everything and going away. Don't do this, friend. Don't do this. Nattu. When a man loses his eyes. . . .even the light of a thousand lamps is useless for him. This fame, this name, this honour. This was just a way to reach my goal. And now that there is no goal. . . .what shall I do with the path. Take care of yourself. ''Life tolerates joy and sorrows, but still she keeps quiet. '' ''Up until now no one had been able to deduce the meaning of life. '' Very good. Very, very good. I believe that we will get the first prize in. . . .the All India Musical Competition. Yes, but you won't come with us to receive the first prize. Sister, do come. We only have to go till Pune. I want to, but the doctor had told me not to travel far. Teacher, I will look after you. You cannot look after yourself. You relieve yourself in your underwear at your age. I do it my underwear and not yours. You do your work. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Children, do you all want your teachers condition to deteriorate? No. Then come back after winning the first prize. Okay? Okay. - All the best. Thank you teacher. Bye, bye. - Come on, let's go. Bye, bye. - Come one. Let's go. Come on, come on. - Bye. Good luck. All the best. Happy Diwali, teacher. Happy Diwali, sweetheart. Do you want anything else, sister? - No. Sister. Shall I say one thing? - Yes. You are alone on Diwali day. I don't like it. Come to our house. No, Sharda, I am fine. Thank you. All right. I will leave. - Yes. Sister, if you need anything. Then ring the bell and call me. Yes? - Is this Priya Verma's. . Dev? Hello, Priya. Hello, Dev. May I come in? Yes, come in, Dev. How are you, Dev? I am fine. May I sit? - Yes, yes. Come, come, please. How are you? - You have asked once. Well, how are you? I? I am fine. I am okay. Your face is saying something else. Yes, that. . I am not well. . Maybe I have fever because of the change in the weather. Don't worry. I won't take much of your time. No, no it is not like that. You're probably wondering what I'm doing here. Yes, I was. To say sorry. Sorry? For what? For not keeping my promise. I didn't come to meet you that day at the Gateway. You didn't come there? Yes, that's why, even though it's a bit late. . . . it's necessary for me to say sorry. So here I am and I am sorry Priya. I am really sorry. It's okay, Dev. It's okay. No, it's not okay, Priya. It's not okay. What I did was very wrong. To break a promise means. . You might have felt very bad that day. Yes, I have felt bad. I thought, what is this? To make someone wait like this. And that also till late at night. By the way, how long did you wait? I mean to say you must have waited long. Isn't it? Yes, I waited long. Around 12, 1 o'clock. . Till morning 5 o' clock. Till morning 5 o' clock. What did you do after that? I was very angry. To be waiting alone at the Gateway till 5 in the morning. . . .with a car decorated with flowers. . . .and all the arrangements for marriage. Look everywhere like crazy. Is she there? Or is she standing there? She will come. Will she arrive with stubbornness. Truly, Priya. It was very bad. Shouldn't have behaved like this. At least a letter explaining why you weren't there. Maybe she didn't know which address to the send the letter to? It's not so difficult to find an address? Now see. I found you by searching your address. You can even find God, if you search for him. You find everything. Except for one thing. True love. You will also get true love, Dev. That means your love was false? Why didn't you come, Priya? Why didn't you come? You have promised that you will come. - Dev, please. We have also decided that is if one cannot come. . . .then the other won't ask questions. - I know why you didn't come. Because there wasn't any true love in your heart. Why are you asking questions, if you know the answer? It is easy to win someone's trust. It is even easier to break it. But it is hard to carry the trust. You have said so to me, right? I can't believe that. . . .the very person who has advised me to sustain trust. . . . has broken my trust today. Well. . Leave love, you didn't even carry your friendship. You didn't invite me to your wedding. I will invite you, when it 's confirmed. You mean your wedding is still. . Forget about me. Talk about yourself. What is happening in your life? I have heard that you have become a great painter. Yes. And this also proves difficult for me sometimes. What difficulties? People see me and say that there goes the crazy painter. . . .who says I love you to every girl. He says, where will you meet me after six months? And the girls come to met you. - Of course they do. Everywhere. Taj Mahal. Red Fort. Charminar. This crazy person calls them at different places and makes them wait. And what does he do himself? Wait. Waiting for someone else. Dev, why do you want to ruin your life? You will surely get some good girl. Don't worry, Priya. I have chosen my life partner. My memories. And today I am leaving this city forever with them. Oh, I forgot. I wish you a Happy Diwali. - No, Dev. I can't take this gift. This is not from me. This is Grandma's gift. Her last wish for me to bring these anklets to you. That's why I didn't get the answer to my letters. No, no. I will wear them myself. Don't worry, Priya. I know my limits. Good bye, Priya. Good bye, Dev. Do you know Priya. I painted a picture. You and Grandma. Do you remember that moment of love when. . . . Grandma had told you that she will send you these anklets. I had imprisoned that moment in a picture. My friend Nattu used to say that that is my best painting. And I had decided that I will never sell that painting. But last week my manager called me and told me that. . A girl has come to the showroom. Who has liked the painting a lot. She saw such details in that painting. . . .which I had always wanted you to see. I told my manger to give that painting to her. Because she didn't have money and that poor girl was lame. . 'No, no. I will wear them myself. ' Do you know Priya what she said when she saw that picture? She said, this is not only a picture, it a moment. A feeling. It is the picture of some love. Don't stare at me like this, Dev. Don't stare at me like this. Why did you hide this from me? Why didn't you tell me? Why didn't it happen to me, if it has to happen? No, Dev. It was my fault. I was running to meet you. When I opened my eyes. . . .there was no land beneath my feet. I have lost my feet, Dev. I am not like you anymore, Dev. I am not like you. Yes. . . .you have become very selfish. You wanted to take all the problems all the difficulties. I only asked for some happiness. You didn't even give me your sorrow. I hate you, Priya. I hate you. Priya. Don't leave me again now. We will laugh and face all our difficulties. Do you know, Dev? Whatever happens happens for good. Now if you return home late at night after marriage. . . .then you won't be able to whack you with my shoes. All the best, Dev. God bless both of you. Now the bride and groom stand up for the rounds.
