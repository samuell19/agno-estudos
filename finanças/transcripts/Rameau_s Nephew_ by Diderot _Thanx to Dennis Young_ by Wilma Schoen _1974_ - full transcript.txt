Did that coffee cup speak? My God! What's so amazing? Not only coffee cups speak. Holy smoke. The voice came from this lightbulb. Yeah, and it's pretty hard to keep me in one place. I swear your pen spoke, Abe. That isn't the only place I can be. How about this? This is unbelievable. That piece of cheese spoke. What's so unbelievable? How about this? Or this. Or this. Or this. Or is this more convincing? It's that portrait of Winston Churchill. Yes, that's right. But where am I now? Those icebergs in the snow scene on that calendar on the wall spoke. That's right. Woops! - Oh, oh oh! - Aagh! Where am I? Camera I may be putting words in your mouth, but... Quote Life is a pretty strange business. But who are we to comment on... Well, I can't think of anybody better qualified. It's not possible... Four... one of us to be objective. There are three ones. One, one and one... We're not in the medium, we are the medium. Is that what you meant? If I see you, I see what you mean, but I need to be seen. You are Alf, I don't understand what you mean. Some creature from somewhere else would have to give an opinion... Can't you see, Natalie? I see Debbie. So do I, but that's not the point. Well, I'm Debbie and I don't see her very well, so what's the point? Nobody knows. But, they think what they can think. Some people claim to know. Would you agree, Alf? Don't you agree, Alf? I don't know. Why not? I changed my mind. To what? It doesn't know. Why don't you let it speak for itself? Mine senses an added complexity to what I think you meant, Alf. If there were a commentator or observer from elsewhere we'd both need an interpreter as well. Dolphin All right But I don't get it. What's the meaning of it all? I've got more to say. And me. What were you going to say? Listen would you like some tea? Where'd you get this? Where did you get this? Who? You mean what. No, I mean who. I think Harry meant me. Alf. That's right. Or do you get what I mean? I don't remember. Pay attention. I'm trying to remember what I thought you meant when you said, if I remember correctly, that it's impossible. Four. One has to be objective about life. Well, I disagree. Now? Now? Now? Then you don't understand what I meant. Explain again. You can't explain now. You'll have to explain later. Try again. Now? Well, I can't explain it. But it means, another time, what's more. Right. Again? Right. Why can't you... Right. Why can't you explain now? I just did! You'll have to explain later. Again? Right. Only upon arrival. God oh... What's going on here? Oh, it's just some people acting up. Do you want some tea? I'd rather... .. sink my tongue... .. in your pussy. Go as you will. Well, we'll have... some tea later. Now it's later again. Probably. He did. He didn't. She does. - He said. - He said. They say. - He said. - He said. They say. - She said. - She said. We say. - They did. - They did. He doesn't. - I do. - I do. - I don't. - I don't. - I did. - I did. - They do. - They do. We did. This entire conversation seems to be so monosyllabic. Doesn't anyone know some compound words like pre-sufalution-less-ly? Yes, I've heard that be. Four. You can hear it again. No thanks. I'm leaving. When you said... one of us, supposedly quoting me... did you mean one of us, here on the screen? Are you... We don't care. Now that's plain talk. I said it. And at the time, I meant of... .. all of us in this room. Where? When I originally said what I said... I said us, and I meant, I recall... humans, all humans. But ti-times have changed. You are all ambitious. Youth wants to know. I'm on a different plane than you. Everybody always knows everything. But they have to uncover it. It's covered. And it takes more time. Than anybody will ever have to uncover it. What good is knowledge, anyway? It makes you bitter. Knowledge is quote power, unquote. And quote power corrupts, unquote. Not only are there many words... you have... heard... but, there are... many combinations... of the ones... that you have heard, which have never been made. Such and such... So and so said. Such and such... Did you hear that? So and so said... such and such. Excuse me, I wasn't listening. Where did you hear that? I'll make some tea. I don't know what to say. I'm so moved by what you said, Charlie. What did you mean by that? Even him... I'm at a loss. Four. Words. This conversation seems to be descending. I think it's going nowhere. Oh, well I thought it was going to... That leaves me speechless. Something's on the tip of my tongue. Keep it to yourself. What's the use? You can't believe anything you hear. (muffled) Oh, that's enough of that kind of shit. We're not hungry, but if we were, we know we could eat, so that's why we can talk this way. How about some tea? Sometimes you say the darnedest things. A lock of pain frees the mind. Count your blessings. This may seem too obviously structural, but I can't stop thinking about what I think you said, Alf. But, I have it mixed with the tea, though. Leave mine alone, please. No cream, no butter, no sugar. I just say what I'm told. Edna, that's a... little... cute remark. Harry, explain. Oh, don't. Don't explain now. You'd fall for miles. For hopes, one shouldn't go further than meaning one of... Fourteen. People, when one says one of us, it's hard enough. Four. Cas... .. one of us to discuss the implications of what you probably said, Alf, - without trying to speak. - Four. Several million people who can't get in the camera today. Four. .. one reason or the other, and who if they could, could perhaps, unlike us, speak. Four. Themselves. And... four. .. midable statement. I think I'm going to cry. Okay. I'll make the tea while you make the tears. What kind of fucking music was that? Train song. No, it was trumpet playing. By the way, why is black music so popular? I give up. Because you can't see white music on the page. That was a refreshing interlude. Now, I'll... It's hard to believe we're miles high over the Atlantic going nearly a thousand miles an hour. I'm hanging on every word you say. I often talk to myself. What was that again? Has this been written? Once. That's enough. It seems overwritten. It needs... editing. It's one thing after another. It wouldn't work, if you ask... More vibrato. We want something. Is that the same we as me? Four. It was what we were, when we were what we are. I agree with Betty. Alf, you are too ambitious. Four. .. your own good. I got this in Mexico. Are you sure it was you, and not some other human? Someone else may have my memory. I'm trying to remember. Just try to imagine something that is impossible to remember. I drove to Mexico in the fall of 1966. With Lewis Hoffman and, and my aunt Naomi S. Welch. In a 1968 Pontiac coupe with a tape deck. We crossed the border at El Paso and were immediately arrested. Lewis and Naomi were beaten by a band of Mariachis. And I stayed out with the great Mexican muralist who was in jail at the time. After the release, we had the car painted changing the color from maroon, male, to cream, female. And drove swiftly to acupuncture where we drank tekweela, swam, sketched, ate pot, peyote, slept, I hate Mexican food. Thought, washed, walked, laughed, rode, rolled, read, jumped, kissed, pissed, reminisced... Did you do anything else? Yes, the boy had me shaved. What white's it? White enough. It covered my chest at its whitest. It sure is at its best when it covers a chest, a breast or... two. Sometimes I feel your mind wandering over my body. It's very gentle and it feels very nice. Thank you. That was my line. Do you mind? I thought Debbie meant Alf, too. This is my line. Hey, that's nice. Now I feel his eyes fucking my ear. What a sight. I don't see what you mean. It's all in your mind. Hmm, it feels like it's all in my mind. Well, you heard what they're saying. Oh Alf, you really are ambitious. Where's the tea? Is that right? Perhaps. Maybe it is, maybe it isn't. I don't mean to lean over backwards, but it seems to be being revealed to us, and perhaps others... Or perhaps the other is here and there, and now and then. But you are, and perhaps were, very ambitious. My inclination is to say what's wrong with that anyway? It's a good and natural thing to want to better one's self. But you don't care who you step on on your way to the top. I just want to go to the bathroom. Too much tea. Here's a new slant on it. Perhaps you Alf, are an objective observer from elsewhere. I'm inclined to believe that what I'm saying is as plain as the nose on your face. I feel the inclination. That tea will be cold. You're not the interpreter we need, are you? Ahem, pardon me. What's your name? Where are you from? What do you do? I am posing as the intent to provide the benefit of one more mind that solves some of the problems that have been troubling you. It's just Alf's mind that's been troubling us. It's mine. I want one too, but who am I? What's mine is mine. For example, this is my hand. Well then here, give me a hand. Have a heart. I'm all yours. Neither my heart, nor any part of me belongs to anyone else. What about your mind? Where are we? I'm lost. Know where you're from, seen or heard. - I'm touched. - I'm touched. I give signs of delight and comprehension. Where is the tea? - What more evidence can there be - What more evidence can there be - than the evidence of the senses? - than the evidence of the senses? I was a catholic. We had an arguments against that. I forget it. - Catholicism wasn't that bad. - Catholicism wasn't all bad. Oh, there was Giotto, Bacione, Peche... Gesualdo, Parrinello, Caravaggio... Palladio, Miconi, Morandi... Paruso, Lasomini, Molinari... Donatello, Paganini. And Dante. The only good Catholic was an Italian. - Vivaldi was a big influence on Johann Sebastian Bach. - Vivaldi was a big influence on Johann Sebastian Bach. - Music is holy. - Music is holy. I think we all agree. Music is frozen... Fucking is music. Music is frozen fucking. Holy fuck. This is something I read and remembered. Music is now in the position of literature. After the invention of... Talk is cheap. Whatever you say. What, if that's... Or is... - We're being seen, we're being deluded. - We're being seen, we're being deluded. We're pro...

I can't wait. Why was I left out? I'm one of us. You're one of a kind. They broke the mould when they made you. I'm the original. Some day my prince will come. - He says. - He says. - She says. - She says. Remind me, Alf. The miracle of reproduction. I don't know why. But, I'm very interested in... women's legs. Perhaps because... With some... they go right... up to their ass. When you're feeling down I mean when I, or some a woman thinks of... dolls men often being told as they say about why I've done that I always do it it's hard to resist It's hard to be good to be good The inviting pro por tion invites and leaves the invited and pleased ge ni tal mind it goes one two four eight to speak of one leg only Rhonda I don't like being described unless it's flattering I'm sure they're doing their best it's a long drawn out process with many variables You know Debbie, you have a well lit beautiful nose I hope I'll be able to see it I know that the nose...

In answer to your questions, one, that remains to be seen. Then two, there's no telling where these remains may go to. So I hear. By the way, there are four '2's. The numeral 'two', the number 'two', the preposition 'to', and the adverb 'too'. Oh, that light is too bright. I think there's something wrong with my two eyes. I notice it especially when I'm being read to. I got (muffled) too. It's hard to make that out. That's nice music. - What music? - That's a nice typewriter. What typewriter? Paul, would you please play a record or say something? I'll say something first. I can't hear. What did you say? I'll play a record. Maybe you'll hear that. That's so haunting. You're not listening. It's one of my favorites. Mary, you do have a way with words. Let's not talk. Let's listen. What iridescence. Let's (muffled) from the start. I'm back. Mary is naturally a very quiet speaker. It's very delicate. Where did you hear that? My voice is what we hear here now. Let's hear something else. And right here, right now. That's nice music. It's polyphonic. You shouldn't read now. How can you listen and read, too? I'm listening. (muffled) Do I have eyes on the back of my head? That's a nice tape recorder. What tape recorder? Hello? Hi, is this Mary? Who's this? Janet, don't you recognize me? No, but he left... No, I have a sore eye. Stage left one. How did you get that? From a movie. It's not my idea. Well, what did you call about? What's happening? I'd like to come over. Where are you? What difference does it make? Sounds like you're having a party over there. It's no picnic. I don't want to read. I want to talk. Well, is it okay if I come over? Sure, and bring anyone else you want. Who is he? Is that Lonnie's voice? Yes, it is. And there are others' voices. I don't see eye to eye with Paul. He's gone to the store. But, bring the others' voices over. Bye now. I don't want to eat, and I don't want to fuck, but I would like to hear. - I'll read to you. - I'll read to you. Thanks Paul, but I'd rather listen to that record that was interrupted by that damn phone call from Mary. Do you wanna hear something else? Oh, it's all the same to me. Okay, here we go. Where are we going? But first, where are we? And second, where were we? In answer to your question... ... that remains to be seen. ... there's no telling what ... may go to. So, I hear. - By the way, there are four '2's. - By the way, there are four '2's. - The numeral 'two', the number 'two', - The numeral 'two', the number 'two', - the preposition 'to', and the adverb 'too'. - the preposition 'to', and the adverb 'too'.

It's not loud enough. That's nice music. What music? That's a nice tape recorder. - What typewriter? - Music. Hi, I'm here. Paul, would you please play a record or say something? - Something first, what would you like to hear? - I can't hear. What did you say? Read it me again. Did you hear that? Now I put on the record. That's so haunting. Is it too loud? 'Piano' by Jean-Philippe Rameau 1683 to 1764, was played quietly when the parts were... (muffled) the piano. - I didn't hear any piano. - Was that the phone? You're not listening. - It's one of my favorites. - It's one of my favorites. Mary, you do have a way with words. Let's not talk, let's listen. Did I say that? Where's Janet? She's gone to the store. I'm back. Mary is naturally a very quiet speaker. It's very delicate. I hate the sound of my voice. Where did you hear that? Speak up. Mine is what we hear now. Well, now that you heard it. Do I have eyes on the back of my head? It's hard to make that out. That's a nice tape recorder. What tape recorder? Is that that damn phone again? Hello? Hi, is this Mary? Who is this? Janet, don't you recognize... Janet, don't you recognize me? Could you speak a little louder, please? Well, I've got two eyes. Stage left one. How did you get that? Well, what did you call about? What's happening? Where are you? Did I miss anything? Sounds like she's having a party over there. I don't wanna read, I wanna talk. Sure, and bring anyone else you want. Is that Lorrie's voice? Yes, it is. I don't see eye to eye with you. I've gone to the store. Bye now. - I don't want to eat, - Fuck. - and I don't want to fuck, - Hear. - but I would like to hear. - Eat. - I'll read to you. - I'll read to you. Thanks Paul, but I'd rather listen to that record that was interrupted by that damn phone call from Mary. Do you wanna hear something else? - Oh, it's all the same to me. - Oh, it's all the same to me. Oh yeah, play that again. Okay everybody. I think there's something wrong with my two eyes. That's enough complaining. Not loud enough. It's hard to make that out. What music? That's so haunting. Is it too loud? 'Piano' by Jean-Philippe Rameau 1683 to 1764, I didn't hear any piano. You're not listening. You can say that again. Did I say that? Where's Janet? She's gone to the store. I can still talk, right? I'm back. You do have a way with words. Let's not talk, let's listen. Did I say that? Where's Janet? She's gone to the store. I'm back. Speak up. It's hard to make that out. I'm not talking anymore. I feel like I'm some kind of puppet. Where are you? Speaking technically, but not aesthetically, one can make the case that there has always been a demand for more and more quote realism unquote, for more and more convincing verisimility in representational systems. In other periods lifelike painting and sculpture, and more recently film and television with various more three-dimensional illusion systems being prepared. There is no doubt that technology is expressing and answering a human desire by working towards systems of greater and greater three-dimensional illusionisms. It is easy to project this to arrive at stages of representation, of absolutely convincing illusion till eventually the difference between subject and facsimile may be eradicated. There are two three... The species thus gives evidence of a need to observe the self. To be able to separate the viewer from the participant. To obtain a state of objective spectatorship. This species' narcissism seems to be an evolutionary force. In a parallel way, consider the evolution of machines, which though not always based on models, as openly as in the specific representational medium, do attempt to present activities, such as flying and sinking. It seems as if we are in the crude stages of creating new life. At present, these new species, machines are characterized by their hardness. This will change with man-machine symbiosis, cloning, and synthesized organic structures. Eventually, the machine mind may be self-sufficient and self-reproducing. Like us in those respects, but unlike us in many others. Perhaps a similar supervised will towards independence accounts for our own distance. Some stage of the future may prevent the line of the species man has created living with man, and also if absolute mirror image would otherwise indistinguishable representation.

All right, don't say it. You filthy minded bastard. It's too late. The time is ripe. All you said was that you wouldn't say that it was unnatural. You didn't say it, and that's only natural. Does it embarrass you? There are some things better left unsaid. But you can say whatever you want. That's easier said than done. It's about time I had the floor.

Both hands are at the right edge of the table. The right hand is reaching for the black rectangle which is near the left hand. Both hands are now turning it around so that it faces the other way, and are putting it back down in the same place. The left hand is reaching to a metal, black thing near the front and with the other hand is turning it around and putting it back in the same place from which it came. The right hand is now turning a white column at the upper right. There's a blue disk next to it; it's being rotated. Near, is a dark green pen and the same hand is also turning that around and replacing it. The left hand is moving to the green plastic scotch tape dispenser picking it up and turning it around. The right hand is reaching for a brown jar red and white label, and is turning it around. Near, is a tiny brown book and it is also being turned around. Another bigger book, a pocket book, near the small book is also being turned so that it's facing opposite to the way it was. At the extreme right a pair of scissors is being turned around, and likewise, for a plastic ballpoint pen near the scissors, and now also another ballpoint pen with a red top next to it. The left hand then the right hand reaches for the black circular shape at the bottom corner and turns it around on the same spot. It's a reel of videotape. The right hand is now turning in the same way a light brown ruler near the black rectangle and the and then rotating, for the second time, the blue disk at the top. Near, is another ruler which is also turning and being replaced, then likewise for a red pen near it. Now both hands are reaching for, then lifting and turning and replacing the typewriter in the middle. Now both hands are also picking up and turning a large black and white photo of hands on a probably piano keyboard. The hands are moving away then going back and are slightly readjusting the photo. There's a pause with both hands at the edge. Now they're reaching for the black rectangle and they're turning it over and putting it back down the same place. The wooden ruler next to it is now being flipped to its underside. The left hand moved to the green scotch tape dispenser and is turning it upside down. Now both hands are revolving the lightbulb near the tape dispenser. The right hand moved to the green pen. Both hands are grasping some white papers at the extreme right, lifting them and are turning them over leaving a yellow piece of paper now on top. Both hands are now reaching for the white, for the videotape reel and turning it over, and moving it back up and turning over the white column near the top. The blue disk next to it is being turned over and now a yellow pencil and and now the metal ruler and also being reversed. The right hand is reaching down for a whitish cup at the extreme right corner. It's turning it around and its contents coffee upside down, replacing them on the surface. The left hand reaches for and is holding a green edged circle at the corner of the typewriter. It's lifting it and turning it over. It's reaching now for the rubber cement jar, turning it upside down. Both hands are moving to the photo of the hands at the keyboard, and turning it over on its face. They now are reaching behind the typewriter and also turning the pocketbook over so its black back is now showing. Something at the top is being reached for and turning upside down, turned upside down dropping what were its contents, pens and pencils mostly. Now both hands are reaching for and grasping the typewriter, lifting it and replacing it upside down. They're adjusting it a little and moving off. One hand is putting, is put on the yellow paper. Now they're both reaching for the typewriter, lifting it and carrying it off. The right hand is returning with what is apparently the envelope, which is being set in the top of the typewriter. They're not turning over something white. They're revealed... they're revealed as Canadian postage stamps. The right hand is reaching behind the rubber cement jar and is bringing back to the left a yellow pencil and placing it beside the first. It's going back to the same spot for another yellow pencil, and moving it onto the yellow paper. Now it's going even further to the right side to a small yellow object, picking it up and placing it in the same place on the paper. It's reaching into the group at the top for another yellow pencil, placing it with the rest. Back near to the same place for another and placing it on the paper. Back to the accumulation at the top for another, moving it in the same way. Then, from the closer to the pa... Then, from closer to the paper it's moving yet another yellow pencil to beside the others. Back again from the group at the top there's another one moving to join the others. The right hand is now moving to one of the five yellow plastic Kodak 35 milli... millimeter slide boxes, picking it up and placing it over the yellow pencil. It's reaching for another yellow box and placing it on top of the first. Reaching back and placing yet another on and at right angle to the second. Reaching for a fourth one and putting it on top the other way like the first two. Reaching back and taking the last one and placing it across the next to the last. The hand is reaching for one of the two dark paint jars with yellow tops. It's placing it on top of slide boxes now getting the other, it's placing it beside the last. The left hand is now reaching for what is called a core. It's yellow plastic with 16 millimeter film on it and putting it on the top of the jars. The right hand is now placing a small white rectangular something with yellow and red on it on top of the film core. Now both hands are being placed at the top. The right hand is at present reaching for the white envelope in the center and is turning it over. Then shifting it a bit. The same hand is placing a red pencil along the red stamps on the envelope, then moving another red pencil from the right top and placing it in line with the stamps and the other red pencil. It's reaching for and picking up a red label can of metal hydrate. It's being placed flat on its side now on top of the envelopes. At the right... the right hand's picking up a red pencil and placing it across the side of the can. The same hand is reaching to near the black rectangle and is picking up another red pencil and placing it beside the last. Near where the last one had been, the left hand is picking up and placing a white pen or pencil with a red top beside the other. The right hand is reaching behind the stack of yellow things and is placing the clear plastic ballpoint pen with the red top beside the others. Now the left hand has picked up the upside down rubber cement jar and is placing it behind the metal hydrate can. The right hand is picking up something at the extreme top. It's a glass bottle of red ink with a white top and it's being placed on the rubber cement jar. The left hand is placing the green ring on the stamps then the left hand is shifting the green scotch tape dispenser to beside the ring, and now it's moving a bright green pen from the upper area to beside the tape dispenser. The right hand is lifting a darker green pen from behind the predominantly yellow stack and placing it in line with the previous green pen. It's reaching to the far left top corner and placing a small green and white box beside the end of the pen. It's going back to the same place and placing another of the same kind of box, only open, next to the other. Back to the same general area for another little box placing it after the second one. It's readjusting it into one position, now another. Now it's moving away to nearby again, picking up a larger similar style box, placing it after the last one. The left hand is moving into and both hands are opening the top of the box. The right hand is removing from the big box another small box and is putting it beside the big box. Then another one is being taken out and being placed beside the last. The right hand is reaching into the big box for another little box, placing it beside the last one, going back again into the big box for another little box, and placing it similarly. The other hand moves in to assist the right, removing another little box and placing it in the same way. And again, both hands are removing yet another little green box and the right is placing it beside the last. From above, the last little box placed on the table, the right hand is moving just, yet another little box to the end of the line. The same hand is moving back to the same area and carrying a thin dark green line to the end of the row. It's a small oil painting bristle brush. Now the right hand is going to the white top of the red ink bottle and turning it around and showing its green label. Both hands are being rested on the extreme right edge, but now the right hand is moving to the top. It's picking up something and placing it on, on... on top of the red pen. It's a pink eraser. The right hand is dropping behind the yellow things and carrying over a little blue circle, placing it down in the center between the red things and bright green pen. From the same area the same hand is moving a blue rectangle and placing it on, no... in the blue circle. It's a matchbox. The hand is continuing to the far left and picking up a blue pen and laying it across the other two blue things. To the top left corner the hand is moving and is picking up a blue pencil and is setting it alongside the blue pen. Then moving it to behind the open box and picking up another blue pencil and putting it beside the others. Moving to the top again, finding yet another blue pencil and is moving it to beside the other blue things. Back it's going to the same area picking up a small paint tube, and placing it on the blue pens and pencils. One of it is rolling away a little. The hand is picking it up and placing it back on the pile. Moving to the right top corner it is carrying over another blue pencil, and is setting it with the rest. Going to the top left, it's swiftly picking up and carrying over a golden, probably brass, something, of course it's placing it beside the yellow slide box, et cetera. It is rolling a little and now the hand is pushing it back. Now both hands are again being placed. They're resting on the edge. The right hand is reaching over the objects to the metal and black thing. It's a rubber roller and the hand is moving it to behind the yellow stack. Holding it there, it's now moving it to the left, down to beside the metal hydrate can. The hand is now pushing the roller and all the red objects across to the left. The right hand is moving the rubber cement jar and the ink. Now both hands are pushing all the various objects to the top and bottom. The right hand is moving to the two masking tapes at the right... top right, and is swinging it across the black videotape reel in the corner. It's raising it across and putting it down in the center. The same hand is moving back to the two masking tape rolls lifting them and depositing them on top of the videotape. It's moving back to the edge of the table then over to the green ring, which is a green cloth tape roll. Carrying it over and dropping it into the larger masking tape ring. From there the hand is moving back to the yellow core on top of the jars. Both hands are picking it up, but the right hand is placing it also in the masking tape circle. Then it's picking up the white column at the right, at the top right, and holding it while the left hand is picking up the green scotch tape dispenser and is setting it on the masking tape ring. Now the right hand is putting the white thing... it's a roll of mailing stickers beside the tape dispenser. Both hands are again resting on the edge. The right hand is going to the rubber cement jar, placing it beside the tapes. From the right corner, it's placing a glass between the jar. Behind the jar. From the same corner it is moving the inverted cup behind the glass. The metal and black roller is being put behind the cup. The hand is moving forward, picking up the blue plastic cap or cup, and is setting it on the jar. From the top left, it's carrying over a pocket watch placing it beside the jar. From the same area, it's carrying something small placing it, it's a coin, a penny, beside the watch. Back to the same place, it is bringing out and placing beside the coin a small brown thing; it's a button. Going back to the same area, it's placing a thin metal ring beside the button. The hand is wavering here and there on the right edge. And now it's going back to the same area and removing another bigger coin to beside the ring. Now both hands are picking up the two yellow top paint jars and placing them beside the last coin. The left hand is now moving to the center and pushing all the assembled objects to the top. The right hand is taking the watch and placing it on the top and replacing it with a white circle, a string, then pulling that immediately back. Now both hands are disappearing. Now they're coming back and placing the typewriter on its side, in the center. They're steadying it and now they're picking it up again, turning it and placing it on its other side. Both hands are being removed, leaving it standing. Both hands are grasping the yellow slide boxes, putting them behind the typewriter. One hand is scooping up the yellow pencils to behind the typewriter. It's gathering the oil brush and something else to behind the same thing. Both hands are gathering the green pens, et cetera, and moving them behind the typewriter. Both hands are picking up two pens and now all the red things on the metal hydrate can and putting them all over and behind too. Both hands are gathering various objects at the right, gathering behind again. Now some smaller objects on the left are going behind. The big cardboard box is being moved behind, followed by a little box and paint tube. Other objects in the upper right are being placed behind. The wooden ruler is moving, being placed behind. The black rectangle is being moved. Some things are being shifted in the corner, and now the hands are dropping them behind. The small bar from the upper right is going behind. Some previously unmoved white envelopes at the right edge are being placed behind. The stamps are being carried there. The orange and grey-green file folders in the extreme foreground are being picked up and carried across to behind the typewriter. The upside down keyboard photo and other papers are also being placed there. The pocketbook is going too. The envelopes, one in each hand, and other papers are being dropped behind. The right hand is brushing a white something off the table to behind. The hands are pausing on the extreme edge. Now the left hand is reaching out and picking up a black and white rectangle and placing it behind the typewriter. The hands are being placed at the right, at the edge again. One of them moves to behind the typewriter and hands out to the other a large watercolor brush. The other hand is reaching in and handing out another smaller sable brush. Bigger than the last but smaller than the first, and putting it between them on the surface. The right hand again is passing out another smaller brush. This one is with a dark handle. Both hands are now resting on the extreme edge. Now they're moving back to the right and away. Izmar begat Rumar, and Rumar begat Izzibar, and Izzibar begat this other bloke. Is that begetting. So everyone begat each other. For document's sake. You know, everybody know uh... That sorts it out, didn't it. George Major May begat Dapply Major begat uh Fred... and so on. 'Course you know, you can trace it all back to Adam and Eve. - The first two. - They are the first two. How are two people... so many millions of different colour, race and creed. You mean how did Adam and Eve have all this children of different colour? - Yeah. - Yeah, well the point of that Dad is that Genesis isn't true in the literal sense. It's analogy. Genesis is analogy of (muffled) It's about the whole lot of human race. Adam and Eve aren't just Adam and Eve. They're the human race personified, that's what I say. All happy like that. Do you believe in God, actually? Well, I pray. When I'm in a tight spot, you know. I say uh, Uh, God please help me out if you're there. If you do help me out I'll believe in you. And uh, thank you very much. I know you're there for future reference. I have a similar attitude. Whenever I feel ill, you know I got a dose of flu, I say a little prayer. I say, "Dear God in heaven, "if you're there, heed my prayer." "If you're not there, don't take any notice." "If you are, make me better by Tuesday, "at 12 o'clock and I''ll know you've done it "and I'll promise to be good forevermore believe in you." Of course, when you get better you don't know whether it's because God's done it, or whether you would've got better in any case. There's no real way of telling what he's up to or where he is. No, you can't tell. I often wish he'd manifest himself a bit more. You know, up in the sky. Yeah, it'd be nice if every now and again he'd part the clouds and golden burst of sunshine gives us a way. "Hello, I'm here. You can believe in me." "Hello, believe me, I'm God." He'd know where you were. I asked the Reverend Steven about this, Father Steven. And he said, much as God would like to keep manifesting himself, he doesn't because it debases the currency. He can't appear more than once every few million years. He can't go around the football matches and places and everything, It debases himself. So, once a million years if we're lucky. I often wish that I'd never been told about God at all. 'Cause it means you can't get away with nothing. I mean, you're told about him, you know he's... And you can't very well, you can't really mess about, can you. - You can't. - No. And what about them people who haven't been told about God. Well, I asked the Reverend Steven this, and he said, if you haven't been told about God that's enough If you don't know good from evil, then you're away. You can do anything you bloody well like. These people in New Guinea for example. They wander about with nothing on. And they commit adultery and steal and covet each other's wives that everybody wants to do. As there aren't vicars about to tell them anything, they can't be got at. So they go up to heaven whatever they do. This means all these (muffled) are going up to heaven. And perfectly decent blokes like you and me aren't going. Adultery, never even committed, we still can't get up there. We're being kept out by these Guineans. I think in that case, it'd be a crime to tell people about God. Well, I never told any about God. - I haven't told anyone. - I haven't mentioned him to a soul. Actually, I'm very fascinated by some religions that say you come back in a different form. - Reincarnation, reincarnation. - Yeah. Buddhism. Oh yes, buddhists believe in that. Coming back as a different creature of some kind or other. What would you come back as? Well, I think if I had a choice I would probably come back as a as a royal corgi, I think. And I would go sitting around the palace, you know. (muffled) improve your status. Yeah, come up a pace. Of course, you could come back as something terrible, couldn't you really? I mean, suppose you come back as a humble mayfly. Well, of course, then you'd only live for six hours, wouldn't you? - Yeah. Well, they have a futile life, don't they. Only live six hours, as soon as they're born, they're worried about old age. By the time they're three hours old, they're feeling middle aged, they can't run like they used to, they got grey hairs all over their legs. And then they die. A dreadful business. - You know Mr. Hobert? - Yeah. - At school. - Yeah. - He's a buddhist. - He's not. - Yeah. He's a buddhist. - Is he really? Yeah. He's a buddhist. He's got this blue bottle in the bathroom. He thinks it's peach. Thinks it's a pirate peach, really. So, keeps going in the bathroom, taking in marshmallows and marmalade, the blue bottle, oh it's getting very big and fat. Horrible thing, he puts out bits of paper hoping it'll complete some poem. He's just got a lot of blue bottles, so far. He still frames them, though. Probably means something to another blue bottle. Well, to a blue bottle, they'd understand it. I'd like to come back as a sparrow. So I could see down ladies' blouses. Well, there wouldn't be much point in that. If you come back as a sparrow, you wouldn't want to look down ladies' blouses. No, you'd just want to look down sparrows' blouses. You'd be interesting as a sparrow. If I had my choice, I'd like to come back as Grace Kelly. Why's that? I've always wanted to know what she looks like in the bath. I've always been fascinated by her glacial beauty. I've always fell for that. In the end, it's a bit of a toss up as to which religion is right, isn't it really? You don't actually know which religion is right. Well, you can't tell with millions of religions, it might be tree worship, it might be buddhism, it might be christianity, - you don't know we're going for, frankly. - No. I mean, you might be a perfectly good buddhist all your life, get up to heaven and there'll be the Reverend Stevens. He'd say, "Get out. Ha ha ha." "Buddhism is wrong." "We're right. Get off with you lot." Or you might be a very good christian, church of England, get up there, there's Buddha. Laughing all over his face, sends you back as a worm. There's no way of telling, really. I think the best thing to do is remain agnostic. Hey, do you think God's been listening while we've been talking? Well, if he exists he's been listening. 'Cause he's omnipresent. He's heard every word we've said. Well, we'd better look religious then. It's no good just looking religious. God, he can see through that. You have to be religious. My dear wife told me that my aunt Rhoda told her that my, that her... My dear wife told me that my dear aunt said that her father... My dear wife told me that my dear aunt told her that her father my dear grandfather said before he died that she'd probably live to see... It's pronounced... I thought it was... I think that's the right pronunciation. Well, we've had enough time to try to pronounce it anyway. It's always nearly over. Yeah, that's a mouthful. Armagedoon. Arra nigadon. Armagideon Arma, armaget... Armagiddon Armageten You took the words right out of my mouth. Aphasia, do you think it's nearly always over? I don't know. Couldn't say. No, it's me that couldn't say. All right, I don't know. I can't say. Say it isn't so. It's not! I'm not at home in time. I don't care if you're late for supper. I love you, Leon. I'm not at home in time is what I said last time. This time we are in a hotel room in Belgrade. Maybe that's what's making you trieste. Talking about it doesn't help. There's lots of time. No, there isn't. There's not enough. You said that just in time. We are floating in the river of life and time is the current. There are rapids and falls. The current is failing. Currently. Sara, you have more of a front than a back, and more of a past than a future than I have. We're all the same here. Uh, can I tell you a story? Is it a love story? It's a Arabic Arabic It's a about about marriage.

Okay, now watch. It's interesting to sometimes try and trace back the evolution of a conversation and see how it got to where it was when we decided to examine it. It's so hard to get the conversation to life. It's best to look at them when they're asleep. They're more relaxed then. I've never spoken in my sleep. How do you know? No sleeping companion has ever mentioned it to me. - Maybe they were asleep at the time. - When? When they were speaking to you. Where do correct ideas come from? Do they drop from the sky? No. Are they innate in the mind? No. They come from social practice and from it alone. They come from three kinds of social practice. the struggle for production the class struggle and scientific experiment. It is man’s social being that determines his thinking. Once the correct ideas characteristic of the advanced class are grasped by the masses these ideas turn into a material force which changes society and changes the world. Idealism and metaphysics are the easiest things in the world because people can talk as much nonsense as they like without basing it on objective reality or having it tested against reality. Materialism and dialectics, on the other hand, need effort. They must be based on and tested by objective reality. Unless one makes the effort one is liable to slip into idealism and metaphysics. Cut. Watch this. That's hard to believe. What's hard to believe? Does anybody want something to drink? How about some oxo? Oxo. Oxo. Oxo. Have you noticed, Have you noticed that the unexpected happens when you least expect it? Do you want to smoke some dope? I'm afraid to smoke that on the scene. It's like smoking in the bed. The screen might catch on fire. Or the screen might get arrested. The picture's trying to get away right now. Hey, wait for me! It can't go anywhere without us. Anyway, do you want some firewater? Oh, please. I think I'll get a bit dizzy. Gee, I wonder if I'm in the audience tonight? Impossible. Well, if I am, "Hello, me." Gosh, what's wrong with my eyes? I can't see straight. Where the hell's that table gone? It was here a minute ago. Here's your drink. Whoops, I'm sorry. It went out like a light. It did not. There's another side to every story. I'll get you another drink. Looking back is depressing. I suppose you all think there's a bed there. Of course there's a bed there. Watch this. What the hell? Well anyway, I have found the table. Here it is. Keep your eye on it. What's on TV, Leon? Have a look. Here's another drink for you, Jacques. Don't put it on the table. What table? This is kind of relaxing. When are we supposed to be back on? Have you seen this entire film? Yeah, this is really hard on the eyes. Ouch. These are really sharp. Make sure that the table gets around. It doesn't need any help to get around. I've missed the bed much more than the table there. Have you been in any good movies lately, Ray? Have you seen any good movies lately, Ray? One question at a time, please. Just another few feet to go. There. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Back in the picture. Well, did you like the lovemaking scene In Nadia Jerkoffski's Stalichnya Makovska new film 'Suck Fuck'? No, it was lovely. Wasn't Sally the little Danish girl with long blonde hair exquisite? Yes. She was so beautiful. So round with a lovely arse. When she rolled over into the bed and opened her legs by first sliding one against the other wasn't that beautiful? Her lips were pink and moist and her luscious thighs revealed in that great closeup her curly blonde cunt hair were all dewey. Her big brown eyes were lovely, too. She really seemed to feel it when the German guy Karl slide his long cock into her. You could read in her eye how good it felt moving in. She moved her breasts in a way just seemed to tell a story. And what breasts... and shoulders oh, and arms! When she turned over, her big breasts and the pink nipples on top just slide to the side with such... what's the word? comfort. Oh yeah, I wanted to touch them and in the movie lucky Gunja Jinn, the Pakistani guy did caress them, kissed them, sucked them, licked them. And she made such a beautiful sound of pleasure. A figure of speech. Seeing is believing. That's what they say. Seeing is necessarily a belief, an act of faith, but to me the phrase should really be "Touching is believing." I'll demonstrate what I mean. Gee, my hands are dry. I've been washing clothes all day. Sara, you got some of that hand cream stuff? Yes. I've got some right here. Try this. Okay, you demonstrated what I meant but I'd like to show you my way. We all suppose... here it's a bed, and actually exists. Of course, I slept there last night and had wonderful dreams. All right. Watch, all of you now. Well, that proved that this was a dream and that that's a comfortable bed. Who said that? Well, we usually use a table to demonstrate reality. That's because a table is more real than a bed at dinner time. What time is it? Time for bed. But what was her role in the film? Well, I'm gonna prove that table's a very table table. If I can get to it. And on the way walking will be believing. Each step is Re-al-i-ty. I don't believe it. You don't believe what? That there is a bed there. It's time to doubt the table. All right. I don't believe it. You don't believe what? That there's a table there. Where? There. Okay, I think I've got enough to work with. In regard to that old saying "seeing is believing" which we will soon be discussing, I think that "hearing is deceiving" is a more accurate way of saying it. I'm not sure I heard that correctly. The sound from outside is so interesting. That's a sound from 1940. It is said that that anything that happens to one of us is recorded in the grave. After death we can all see-hear our lives' sound-movies in their entirety. First, we'll have to see it all from the beginning. But then you can see parts of it as often as you like. Can we get to see other peoples' life-movies too? Yes, anybody. Will my father and mother come to the theater to see me? Oh yes. Will they be like it? Oh, couldn't be truer. (UNINTELLIGIBLE) Well Well, you're right. There's no table there. Isn't there something familiar about that table? What table? Where's the hammer? Maybe it's a multiplication table. If it is a vege-table, we can prove that "eating is believing." And that is what I believe. I'll set the table. I give up. I don't believe in anything. I'm hungry. I'm horny. And now, "Lying in Bed" I am not in bed. Sara, hearing you lie in bed like that makes me even hornier. I suppose you all don't think there's a bed there. Of course. I slept there last night and had wonderful dreams. Which reminds me, I woke last night thinking that my watch was gone. Was it? No. But, it was going. Ha ha. Now watch this all of you. Gee, my hands feel soft now. Mauve yellow red magenta orange blue green midnight blue purple pink aquamarine amber sky blue Where was the bed? To oblige you I will try to believe almost anything. but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this. For were I persuaded that Charlotte had any regard for him I should only think worse of her understanding than I now do of her heart. My dear Jane Mr. Collins is a is a conceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man You know he is, as well as I do You must feel, as well as I do that the woman who marries him cannot have a proper way of thinking. You shall not defend her, though it is Charlotte Lucas. You shall not, for the sake of one individual, change the meaning of principle and integrity nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me that selfishness is prudence and insensibility of danger security for happiness. "I must think your language too strong in speaking of both," replied Jane. "And I hope that you will be convinced of it." "by seeing them happy together." "But enough of this." "You alluded to something else." "You mentioned two instances." "I cannot misunderstand you, "but I entreat you, dear Lizzy, "not to pain me by thinking that person to blame, "and saying your opinion of him is sunk." "We must not be ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured." "We must not expect a lively young man "to be always so guarded and circumspect." "It is very often our own vanity that deceives us." "Women fancy admiration means more than it does." "And men take care that they should." "If it is designedly done, "they cannot be justified." "But I have no idea of there being so much design "in the world as some people imagine." I give the earphones to you, Eva. And you put them on the table. And then Leon says, "If that table could talk." If that table could talk. It only remembers the pain. Maybe the pleasure was all ours. I wonder what it would be like not to be able to read or write. Everything would be different. The name of a thing sits in front of the thing. Everything that you know the name of. The world will end when everything is named. Helen Keller would disagree. (muffled) What do you think of this? What do you think, Ray? Helen Keller had a lovely voice. Sara? I felt the pianist has a nice touch. Leon? It was touching. And you, Aphasia, what do you think? I don't understand why it was put there. It would have been better... after the conversation about the Indians. Or uh... just after Ray smashed the table. I thought it fitted very well. This sentence in its entirety was replaced by trumpet music. I didn't know you could speak trumpet. Can you guess what I said? Aphasia can guess till the cows come home. You can guess till you're blue in the face. That's strange. That's what I was just gonna say. Aphasia can guess till the cows come home. You can guess till you're blue in the face. That's strange. That's what I was just gonna say. You can guess until you're blue in the face. You can guess till you're blue in the face. You can guess till you're blue in the face. You took the words right out of my mouth. You can guess till you're blue in the face. You took the words right out of my mouth. Ah, I give up. You always have the last word. I bet I just look like I'm talking. I'm just looking. Did you read that article about illusionism? It said things like this would get more and more realistic until you wouldn't be able to tell the difference between me and the movie of me. Before that happens we'll destroy everything. Love is the only hope. The only hope is art. Is this film art? No, this isn't art. It was once, but now nature is art. I wish I was a 12th century Kwakiutl Indian. I would rather be one of the "Suck and Fuck" Indians. Anyway, they (muffled) compared to ours. The Kwakiutl Indian might've wished to be you. No. He'd have known better. They knew some (muffled) we don't. Wind, temperature, moisture, plants and animals were all like parts of them. I think for the Kwakiutl Indians, life was difficult (muffled) diseased. And that all the women were like slaves. Maybe. But there must have been some happy women. And we diseased (muffled) And at least, their danger was noble. Not like the danger of being hit by a bus. It's safer on the screen than on the street. The Indians wouldn't have Chinese food. And we modern day people can go anywhere and fast. And out of this world too. They'll soon be colonizing Mars. (muffled) Mars Anyway, space travel is just another TV show. Just because we can go anywhere every place is more and more of the same place. All the cities are like zoos, of us and for us. All we ever do is look at us and things we've did. And all our so-called entertainment is just of us and by us. All we ever do is look at us and what we did. And then we talk about it. Well then, what did the Indians do then for entertainment? Finches, hawks, warblers, owls, jays, cormorants, snipes, quails, ptarmigan, gulls, falcons, swallows, herons. Are there as many different kinds of birds as there are departments in the department store? The eagle isn't extinct. Maybe the (muffled) death of the (muffled) That article said we're inventing a new species. What I think we're doing (muffled) gradually mixing it all up. (muffled) Parts are still visible. But were all life to become just one big grey changeless substance, the globe would be a ball, dead, durable (muffled) That's a sad note to end on. Is this the end? It's very close.
