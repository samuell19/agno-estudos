This is me. Name's sayan. Born in 1970, almaty. My parents are regular folks. They didn't spoil me. Parents tried to give me ordinary Soviet education. My childhood was serene and happy. Move it! Hold your stance! I was twelve when father took me to box trainer. I remember his words: Son, you must know how to defend yourself. Can't say I immediately liked these training. But I tried not to miss any of exercises. Roll it, roll it. Work with your hands girls doing push ups on their palms. Doing push ups on our fists. Legs higher, pull your fingers. Ok doubles. Good. Work it with doubles. One two breach! Sayan, hold your hand higher. Left fist higher. And do not blink please. Ok. Good. Move it, move! Right. A bit faster. Time has passed. I began participating in competition. Winner by knockout is bekkerimov sayan! I became the city's champion. And the winner by points is bekkarimov sayan!!! I became the Republic's champion. But mom wasn't impressed much with my accomplishments in boxing. He must think about his education! Have you ever thought of who you want to become? And you! Have you seen his pupil's Mark book? Well. Pupil's Mark book was not good. Nevertheless I finished the school. When I finished school dad find me a job. I was a courier at local administration office. It was drudgery. I was running carrying letters... From one office to another. But I prefer to remember teenage communications. Pashka, give me smokes. Almost every evening me and the boys were sitting near the actor's academy. We started fights after salute on old square. We took things from weak boys. Disco was a good place too. After I failed to pass university exams mom was very disappointed. Father couldn't do anything. That Autumn I went to army. Squad! Get up! Two years passed like a long day. After army I finally entered university. Dad, look! Timur, he's a student! Honey! When Soviet union fell apart my father became jobless. Mother also become dismissed and started to sell things on the streets. Hard times came in. But I never stopped boxing. To be honest... I was always good with my fists. Box! Stop. One, two, three, four... I guess that was the day they noticed me. Five, six, seven, eight, nine, out! They came to my gym a week after. Sayan! Sayan, there are people calling for you. How are you, lil'brother? - Ok. - What's your name? Sayan. You're doing pretty good. I'm trying to do my best. Do you want to meet worthy men? We can find a job for you. You'll earn a good money, buy yourself a car. Well, I must think on that. Ok, make your choice. We will accept your decision. And I began thinking. I made my final decision at assel's courtyard. Asselya! Hello! Hi! Sorry, sayan, I cannot go with you today. I am invited... Assel are you coming? On a birthday party. Got to go. Bye-bye. Don't be insulted. - Who do you need? - Ruslan. Ruslan, big brother, it for you. Oh, lil'brother! Come in have a seat! Next day I was sitting in a back seat of a BMW. Sayan, you see that boozer? There's a back entrance. The owner is abu. Go to him he'll give you money. If anything happens don't talk much with him. Let him know that ruslan sent you. You got that? Ok. How much is his debt? - Quite a debt he has. - I see. Hold it! - Where's abu? - He's busy. Hey, look! Wow, he beat them alll he's cool! You're abu? - I get it. Please don't hit me. - Ruslan sent me. Give me the money! In a second. Here you go. Mister! - Brother! - Asshole. Can you do it faster? Beer. Now. What? - Give me the beer! - Here! You did pretty good, lil'brother. Here's the money. Now he's your client. Meet him once in a week. Take the stuff. Half is mine, the other half is yours. Here. Take it. Let's go. And so I began my visits to ab... Oh, sayan! Come in, dear. That is how my new life began... I spent almost everyday with my new family. Now I had my elder brothers and big' bros. This is our eldest brother ruslan. Let me go! Ahh! When he was student, he was strongest in all nearby dormitories. Bastard! This is body. He's a Republic's champ at free style wrestling. Now he's a champ at beating out the coins. These are asan... And eidos. Reliable good fellows you can always count on. Wait, he's trying to tell something. I'll give you everything please don't kill me. And this is aman. Respected among others. Don't make any noise if you want to live. Daring raids and robberies are common practice for him. D years ago there was a scandal story about jewelry shop hijacking. Stand still bitch! So. He was one of the hijackers. I left my university. Everyone around me was making money. We were no exception. I guess we were the last who still played with thimbles. I came from the us on my green bike. The bike got broken and I am here with you. Come my good men, feel like home. Find the ball, win you day. I am not enforcing you to play. Hey, give me the money you owe me from yesterday. What? Shut up! - Go to hell! He came to make demands. - What happened? - He's an asshole! - What do you want? I overreacted that day. That guy was in hospital with head trauma for two months and I had no choice but to run away. I spent six months in kustanay till cops got calmer. That wasn't a boring vacation locals were funny guys. Time passed merrily. When I came back to town brothers already took control of one bazar. Look the racketeers. Yeah, they are every where. Goods from Poland, China and uae flooded our markets. Merchants and bazaars had their income in tons of usd. Ruslan couldn't miss his chance to participate in that. - Bake, how are you? - Dear, ruslan. Come in, brother! Wait here. That time we also began protecting specific enterprising businessmen. Sometimes we even did it in motion. Hey, wait! So, guys, where are you from? - That person was your chief? - Yeah, so what? - Looking for somebody, young men? - You. What do you mean? I mean - you. You have started your own business. Yeah I did. So? Who is your partner? "Who is your partner?‚Äù. I work alone. It might become hard to work alone. You're driving a cool wheels. Bad guys might see that and think that you have a lot of money. Et cetera. Understand? But if we work together bad guys will won't think anything. You got my point? It's ok, go. Well, I think I understood. And our next song is for ruslan and his friends is presented by brother serik. Ruslan! Cheers! Money was flowing to us by themselves. We earned honor and respect. Bro that's from me. We were having a good time that years. Bro that's from me. That's from constantine. - Yes! - I won! That suits you very good. Do you like the suit? I became close friends with aman. He always told me right things. I learned a lot from him. Brothers. Pubs and girls will do us no good. We might become relaxed. We got things under control, bro! Everything's under control? That is when jan appeared. Enterprising businessman. How much? He was making money 24 hours a day. 5 thousand. He had special relations with ruslan. Excellent! Of course by prepay. They want to kill me! Don't worry I know them. We'll solve that issue. - Who's that? - Jassyk. Name's jassyk. They are... real bastards! Can you imagine? In the daytime in my courtyard... They came to push on me. We know where you live. Your wife's office. We know how much you earn. You shit. Pitiful huckster. You owe us a quarter understand? If you do anything you're dead. I'll give you a couple of my boys. - They'll be with you. Guarding. - All right, good. We'll take care of that. Let's go. Bye! Who chose the meeting place? They did. The thing is jassyk knows that jan is our businessman. He wants to screw us, you'll see. Aman. We must finish this matter. Well, I think we can solve that. We'll talk. What are you saying? I do what I want to do. Do you want to protect the huckster or you want to pay his debt? Huh? I repeat: Leave our businessman alone. You man. That's not going to happen, told you. Why are you nervous? Who are you to forbid me to get nervous? Who are you anyway? You came here and telling me all this shit. Huh? And your ruslan has no weight for me. You got that? Talking is over. Look! Look! What the helll go to him! Drive! Let's go! Eventually cops sniffed a track of aman. He was found and imprisoned. He didn't sing for cops and went to jail alone. Jassyk's murder cost him 10 years. Defendant, get up. Defendant is found guilty in crime mentioned in article 88 part "b" of current criminal offence and his punishment is determined as 10 years of imprisonment. Look there he is. Brother! All right, let's go. Ruslan tried to pull aman out. But all his attempts were unsuccessful. No. No way. Too late. Let's go. Book it on us. We also helped his mother. Mam. That's from aman. All these events regarding jassyks murder has increased our weight. Oh ruslan! People began talking about us and considering our words. Hello, big brother ruslan. How are you, kalyshv? How goes your business? Everything's okay? Yeah all goes well. I just came to relax here. - Hi, bodya. - We'll stay here. Time was passing. Life was changing to something better. Jan expanded his business. Asan and aidos parted ways with us. And body... bodya got married. Aman came to islam. Ruslan has become really powerful. What about mev I am always near ruslan. You tell him that. I'll tear his ass apart. Annoying bastard. Let's move. Even in that rare occasions when I came to parents, I never had normal family talk. So what kind of job you have? You don't return home for days. Do not think of me. Think of your mother. - Well it's kind of a job. - What kind of job? Show me your job contract! Sayan, finish your meal. Greetings. Glad to see you. We'll find you the best table. No need. We are invited. O! Here they are! - Ruslan! Glad to see you. - Hello, how are you. Looking good! Guys, please come. Have a seat. I want to raise this goblet... For my friend. My brother. For ruslan. This man helped me a lot. He even risked his life. I... think. I hope... that he does not feel regret about that. And thanks to that, today we live better than yesterday. And tomorrow we'll live better than today. Ruslan, if my business goes well you'll be well too. Humm.. Or vise versa. If you are okay, then I am okay too. That is because we are in one boat with you. In a submarine. Cool! This song is a present from brother jan to brother ruslan. You told me that you have connections in Moscow. Listen. If we force this matter through Moscow we'll have a good profit. Just two years... and money will flow to us by themselves. And you know there is no factory like that. That evening I met assel. I'm thinking about this for a long time. We have to start production, you see? - I'll be in a second. - Can you imagine? Only two years. I told you. - Hello! - Hi! Mind if I join you? No, not at all. You came at a good Tome. This is my friends Lena and roza. Today is her birthday. - Grats! - Thanks. Congratulations. Happy birthday! Grats! This is my favorite song, let's dance. - No, I'll wait here. - Come on. Come on. Hey, come on. I don't know why, but I was glad. I got divorced. What is the name of your company? Ruslan & co You know my parent's are not at home today... Maybe we'll come to my place. We'll drink some tea. Let's go. Tomorrow's 8th of march. That's for you. Ahh. Thank you! - What is it? - Look. Wow! We became a couple. This is a dream, handsome. - Tough huh? - You're a tough guy, huh? Do you want me to pick that star for you? Ok, get it. I can't. - Never smoked marijuana? - No. Try it. How should I hold it? Like this? - Correct? - Pull the smoke. One day I met my old school friends. Sayan! Glad to see you, friend! - Hello! - Watching soccer? Greetings, sit please. Oljas, ask for a stool. - Yeah take it please. - Girll waiter! Sayan, this is iskander. We were studying together in us. - Sayan. - My pleasure. - Assel. - My pleasure, vlad. My pleasure. Me and oljas with sayan from the same form. Goal! I see. And you oljas what do you do? I'm in a bank. Chief. Got wife, kids. All that kind of stuff. Don't you know? He's one of the best bankers. Quit talking. And you? What do you do? Working in a company. Ruslan & co iskander do you remember that fishing im Miami? Actually we had nothing to talk about. They had their lives and I got mine. - Hello! - Hi! I don't have any place to go. Well come in. That time I already lived apart from parents. Assel has moved to me. This is volodya. His guys are from Moscow. They came to town for a very serious meeting. - It's getting stuffy. - Yeah a bit. They solved their problems through ruslan's connections. When we were at Moscow they met us worthily. Now they are our guests. Look, volodya, there's a one matter in the Moscow. What kind of matter? Tell me numbers? Give me the pen. We also did our business along the way. Can you contact this man? No problem. We'll find him. Hi! - Hello. Ruslan's there? - There. Jan came. - Jake how do you do? - Fine, and you? Hi, ruslan! This is volodya and this is our friend jan. Jan. My pleasure. Volodya. Greetings. He'll tell you the details of our yesterday's talk. Sasha, go for a walk. Listen. We became known not only in Moscow. Other people also wanted to meet us. Stay were you are! Everybody don't move! - Don't move! Don't move! - Do not drop anything from hands! Hands! On the ground! Legs wider! Keep your hands behind your head! I said watch your hands! Kiss the wall! Legs wider! Keep your hands behind your head! Lay down. Nobody moves! Lay still! We were registered in police as an organized criminal group extorting money. And when anything noisy was happening in town we were the first to be summoned to police station. They didn't kept us long if we had nothing serious. It was like a "job's features". I didn't use my fists all the time. That time our primal activity was debt collecting. We were returning money from debitors, for a share. And we were helping our partners. Hello, guys! Where's your chief? Are you trying to scare me? I was frightened a lot! Return the money. I don't have the money. I already told him. I'll cover my debt when I get money. You are free to go. Wait, bastards! Stay! Is that your white camry? You can stake it. Is that fair for you? Sonny, please let me go. How can you hold me for so long? Old man, we're telling you. Take the credit in a bank, return the debt and be free. He doesn't return money to our man for a year. - Sonny, I told you. - Wait. - And we didn't hurt him. - Wait, who is your partner? I am murat. Asylkhan's brother. Asylkhan's? Wait a sec. Hello, tayr, how are you? Here's murat came for talking. So, you know about it. How should I treat him? Ok. Bye. Here's the story. The old man gives you a quarter until the end of month. End of story. Or you might not get anything at all. Deal? Deal. Hi, jan. What? Where are you? Are they close? Tell them to wait. I'm on my way. Guys, let's go! It was jan. Just as always he needed ruslan. He and his wife had conflict with cafe owner. Owner called his guys and jan called us. - So? Where's your friends? - Jan, don't do that. Are you afraid to wet your pants? Then go to toilet. Shall we cut his head off, guys? Yeah we can do that. Don't do that, jan. Ruslan! And now bastard you'll ask me and my wife for forgiveness. Don't do that, jan! Right hand meanwhile jan's factory project has. In the same evening he invited ruslan for celebration. - Jan, stay close. - I'm coming. These are all ours. Everybody, in your own time. Good evening ladies and gentlemen! I am sorry for this little inconvenience. - What? - This table is reserved. There was bajyk in the club. Brother of jassyk, killed by aman. Thank you very much for understanding, please forgive us. Thank you, sorry. Clean the table. Quickly. We'll do our best for a guest like you. Please, have a seat. Next time please call us to make an order and we'll make your evening excellent. Thank you. Say hello to your chief. Come in. How do you feel? Hello, what will be your order? Please bring us 2 bottles of Remy marten... - Bajyk is here. - I know. Strawberry. Strawberry? Of course my sweety. My golden girl. And bring the menu please. Ruslan, we don't need the menu. Come to the club and wait downstairs. Just in case if anything happens. Sayan, name your drink for today. What's your poison? - Orange juice. - Orange juice? Are you kidding me? We have Moscow matter solved. Factory's matter solved. Rus, you tell him! Jeke it's all right, relax. Well then orange juice. No two of them. He's a sportsman what can I do. Having fun, guys? You have forgotten about jas don't you? Do you think he has nobody to avenge his death? What do you want? What do I want? Take the knife and let's go outside if you're a man. Be quiet. Let's go. Jan, wait here. - Let's go outside. Move it. - Take your hands off. It's ok. Relax. Move it. - Move it. Move it. - I said, take your hands off. - You're making me mad! - I am going to kill you right here. Don't move. Aman will pay personally. - You wanted to ask from me? - Yes! - Eat this! - You're so tough, guys? Fighters huh? Ruslan! Stay where you are! You're gonna die, punk! Take this one with you. Quickly! - Brother, what should we do with them? - Nothing. Let's move. Damn it. Listen up, jan. You haven't seen us. You don't know us. Got that? It's necessary. Talk things with administrator. Tell your girls to shut their mouths. Otherwise I will shut them. Nobody never find baijykburied by our brothers in the steppes. We never lookback. Ruslan only gazed forward. - Kurmagazy? - Yeah. Sad music... It's not sad, it's serious. And we also have to start doing serious business. Serious business. Serious money. Soon jan finishes his factory construction. We'll visit him there. And so on. Yes, lil'brother? And how is your family? It's ok. In the end of 2003 aselya gave birth to my son. Hello! Yes dad. It's ok, I am at maternity hospital. Weight and height is okay. She feels well too. Don't worry, when she leaves hospital, we'll register our marriage. Bekkarimov? I'll call you back, dad. - You're the father? - Yes. We did what we could. Unfortunately we couldn't save the baby. I am sorry. My son didn't live till the end of the day. Medics told me that he had no chances. - Wow. Bravo. Cool! - Good shot! Sayan, you're super best. It's nice here. A day is fine. Sayan is like legendary voroshilovsky strelok. - Sayan, do you want to eat? - No. Yeah... Your fans calling you? Before I forgot... Can you imagine? We have a rival! He wants to build a similar factory. I met him. I told him that 2 factories are too much for our market. And you know what? He doesn't listen. And even more he is making problems for us. He surrounded himself with shady people. He says that he is going to crush us. - Give me his name and address. - Ok. - Jan, let's go home. - All right sweetie in a second. Let's drink! Sayan, for you! We disinclined that rival to do any business. And in the beginning of a summer jan has finally opened his factory. Thank you. Everything went smoothly before one day. It was unexpected. He's in the office? Let's go to his place. Now. - Ruslan! - How are you, jan? We'll talk later. Glad to see you, my dear friend. - I told them you are busy. - It's ok. - Have a seat. Tea, coffee? - No need for that. Jan, where have you gone? Look, ruslan. I'm a busy man. I have meetings and most of them important. And during meetings I cannot talk by phone. During these two months you couldn't find a minute for a friend? To call me. To ask how do I do? To know how do our business goes? By the way how about our business? You mean your share of the factory? Precisely. You know a lot happened, something's changed. It's hard to work now. Well long story short my partners said, I cannot help you. What partner? I wanted to tell you. I have a partner. Very powerful man. Jan, I do not understand what are you talking about? Ruslan, I expected that you might not like this. I think it will be better for three of us to meet and talk things over. You'll talk with him and find a compromise. You're such an asshole, jan. You thought that I'm going to leave all this? After all I have done to you? What are you thinking? Not at all ruslan. We're friends. Who's that partner? Arrange a meeting with him. I want to talk to him personally. You'll tell me when and where. Understood? Rus! Well I get everything, but I had to start talking. Bro, what happened? That jackal promised me a share in this factory for our Moscow business. And now he's acting shady. Shall we punish him? First I want to see his partner. Then we'll see. Speak. Jan, quit shaving my brains. Leave the talking for tomorrow. Tomorrow. Fatman's place. 9 pm. Next day. 9 pm we were sitting at fatman's restaurant and waiting for jan's partner. There's a slight complications. Look at this numbers. I guess he came. Look here, contractor made us problems. 20 millions loss. And he covered it again. You see? He arrived, I'll meet him. How do you do, make? You look very good. Nice suit. - Where to? - There he is. - Tea, coffee? - No. Ruslan. Make. Yes, I heard of you. Make I have just explained rustam our situation. I hope ruslan understand what we are talking about? Yes, rustik, you deserve a lot. You did very good for the factory. I must reward you. Take this. - What is this? - Your share. 200 thousand. Hey, who do you think I am? I'll talk with you in my way. You got that? Ruslan! Let's go! Bro, who was that? Just some kind of guy, he says that he is a businessman. But trying to look like he's mafiosi. So jan jumps off. He wants to screw with that old man. - We'll do it. Do it hard way. - Bro, should we stay with you? No need, everything's going to be fine, lil'brother. - Just come earlier tomorrow. - All right. Yes. He was murdered? How? Where are you? I am on my way. Something happened? No, nothing really. I lied. Someone shot ruslan at night. That was hard to believe. Thoughts one after another like a kaleidoscope passed through my mind. I really wanted this to be untrue. Hello! - Tell me what you know. - I couldn't get it myself. A rumors appeared. All casino was in schock. We tried to get information. Sent boys to the place. There was cops everywere. Guys from TV. They've made a show out of this. They say he was shot point blank. In his own apartment. Who was the first to know? Neighbours. Entrance door was opened wide. Oh.. Man. Something's going to happen. Today they'll drag our guys in. In the morning I was sitting at investigator's room. - Hello! - Hi! - Some gang leader was killed huh? - Ruslan was killed. He met his fate. Yeah. Control shot. All that stuff. Assassin did that. Where is alimov? - He'll be late. - Let him come in. Ok. So bekkarimov you are saying that you was home that evening, you can prove that and you don't know anything? I told you that I do not know anything. Sign this, you are free to go for today. We'll call you again if it's necessary. Actually I did known whom should I search. Marat, go to upper town, I will be there soon. Leave it, thank you. Malysh, take the money from tolik, go to bazaar. Buy some tea, candies, nuts, dried fruits. A lot of them. Then take it to ruslan's home and take control over situation. Meet people there, take people home. Ok? I'll do that. Here, take my car. I think, jan did it, and I want to kill him. You know where he lives? I'll do that. Only now I finally realized that ruslan is dead. The ground brake under my feet. I didn't knew what to do. The only thought that kept me alive was revenge. I wanted to tear jan apart. That was the first time when I made decision without ruslan. Next day - Malysh, have you seen jan? - No, he wasn't here. - Hello! - Hi! - So you're still in that job? - Yeah still. You can see it by yourself. How are you, bro? How is your family? It's ok for now, alkhamdillya. When I was released it was difficult. But I got used to it. Parents helped me. I am sorry for what happened with ruslan. Yeah. Let's go to restaurant? Brothers gather out there. I'll take you on my car. Well talk by the way. - I have to stop at mosque to pray. - Ok. Follow us. Good. Ruslan was a worthy fellow. Everyone is going to pass to the other side. Sooner or later. Life is short. Happiness, wealth and beauty is a gift only few can get. And death my dear brother is something that makes everyone equal. You know aman ruslan was very disappointed,.. When he couldn't set you free. Believe me, he tried to do everything. It's ok, sayan. In this life I do not owe anything to anyone. And I think that anyone doesn't owe me anything. I stood my ground when it was necessary. I did what was needed to be done. Do you feel sorry for these 10 years? Not that much. I find something in exchange. In this life you shouldn't lose yourself in the first place. One day I just realize that everything has it end. And my sentence too. You know I've met many people in the jail. There was an old man. He told me many things. He taught me to endure and to treat life as it is. With contentment. You know, every man has a bowl over his head. Bowl fills with all injustices that person does. Someday that bowl might overflow. And all that evil will pour out on that person. Response action, huh? You can call it that way. On cemetery you heard imam quoting quran. It was chapter regarding power. It says that Allah has created life and death to test us. To see whose acts are better. And he will ask from us for our deeds upon our return to him. Trust me. His questioning will be not like anything in this life. Where is that businessman jan? Creeping somewhere that bastard. He even didn't came to funeral. Now he has his wings spreaded wide. Last time he had misunderstandings with ruslan. A word of advice, lil'brother. Be wary before taking any action. Do as you think you should. If you want to do reverse action or no. Mind that nobody is going to blame you for anything. Sayan, big brother, it's for you. Hello. Yeah. Wait there, I'll be on my way. Here take this. Bro, we have unfinished business. I'll finish it see you tonight. Take care, lil'brother, call me this evening. - I was glad to see you. - Me too. - See you. - Bye. While we was talking, my boys find jan. He was at his concubine. He loaded his Jeep with a couple of cases and moving in direction to airport. Yes, he's driving to airport. We'll meet him at parking exit. Ok. It will be ok. Excellent. Good. I have arranged that. You're the best! - Lil'brother, is there a parking for me? - That way, sir. All right. No, it was not for you. Speak. I'll call you upon my return. For a week. Ok. Bye. Guys. Guys! It's a mistake! Guys! Guys, please don't do that. Let me go. Where are you taking me? Take him over here. Let me go, guys. Please let me gol! Let me go, I have a child! Guys, what are you doing? - Sayan, is that you? Sayan! - Shut up! - Sayan, it's him! - Shut up, you shit! - It was him! It's my partner! - Give me the gun. It's him. He told me that he'll take care of things. It's not my fault. Bastard! After all ruslan has did for you! Please don't do that, sayan. I have a child. I didn't do anything to you. It was not me! I didn't. - It was not me! I didn't. - You will tell me where to find him. I know why I didn't pulled the trigger today. Jan couldn't keep his promise to ruslan. I guess the thing went not as was expected. He needed money. Then the partner appeared. Jan lose control over situation. And ruslan didn't wanted to accept that. But I want to repay for ruslan. They will try to find me sooner than I do. Anyway it has no big meaning for me. I won't hit the ground so easily. And I won't hide. - Malysh, you also don't know "qto"? - Nope. It's "quit that, ok?" I wanted to talk with aman, but he was out of reach. Bro, what should we do? Rent an apartment and prepare your guns for the morning. - But now go home. - Shall we go with you? No, need for that little brother, it's ok. All right. We should't say farewell. Hi, assel. I'm on parking. Going home. Sayan! Run! That's it. That's my life. Nothing special. If I had a chance to live it again would I chose another path? Anyways it was too late to change anything. I guess my bowl was over flown. Sorry for my mother. She'll cry. It's getting colder... I'll close my eyes and...
