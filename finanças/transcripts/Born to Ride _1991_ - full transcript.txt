The United States army welcomes you to fort Manning, Kentucky, home of the 30th division of the first mounted cavalry, where the historic formation of this legendary unit took place. Colonel's daughter! Today the 30th division is to be awarded the merit of excellence medal, bestowed upon those who have excelled in the service of the United States army. Sorry I'm late, daddy. If you showed up on time, we'd all have to reset our watches. I hope Jack didn't notice. I'll never hear the end of it. With us from Washington, D.C. to present the medal is general Thomas chaffee and our own commander here at fort Manning... colonel James e. Devers. Today we honor a loyal friend who so valiantly toiled for us in the Mexican border revolt... nazarro, the mount of captain Jack hassler. And rusty, who, at the forefront of our military effort, helped to protect U.S. interests in China. Dismount. These magnificent animals must make way for the inevitability of change. What you're looking at is the wave of the future. These machines were designed specifically the toughest, most dependable military vehicles in the world. Very impressive machines, Jim. Yes, they are. Is the conversion of horseflesh into horsepower, of America's first fully mechanized cavalry unit. Well, I think you'll be very happy, tom. Captain hassler reports a very promising first week on the motorcycles. Start your engines! Hey! Move out! That's enough, cartucci! Move that bike out now! Hey, you! Stop! He's crazy! Who the hell is this guy? He knows what to do with a motorcycle. Yes, he does that, doesn't he? Move it! Hey, wait a minute! Hold it, you! Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo! Hey, boys! Hi, grady! Come on. Come on, Dixie. Come on. There we go. Let's go. Come here. Grady. Hey. You had a visitor. She leave her name? Yeah. She left her name... sheriff greaves. I hope this don't mean I need a new mechanic. Ah, don't be such an alarmist, Gus. Ah... Ow! Danny. Hey, Danny, wait up. ♪ They can't give me a family ♪ ♪ no more, no more, no more ♪ ♪ where I go I go, and I don't pay ♪ ♪ I need a new job about every day ♪ ♪ it evens out something that I don't do... ♪ Yeah! A small token of our appreciation to grady westphall, the best damn racer of the county... today. Thank you! Thank you very much for this most prestigious award. I'll keep it in a place of honor. Willis, your ma's on the phone. Hi, charlene. It's real nice to see you. Mind if I cut in? Heck, sheriff, I thought this was our little secret, but... Excuse us, charlene. I've been trying to nail this boy for years. He causes a heap of trouble around these parts. We got him good this time... trespassing, destroying U.S. government property, assaulting the army personnel. One year ain't enough, if you ask me. No, sir. You got a visitor, westphall. Now, if you army boys ever need anything, you just let me know, you hear? You know, you ride that motorcycle like most people walk on two feet. Too bad you didn't appreciate it. Oh, I did, I did. How long you been riding that thing? Hmm. Well, let's see, now. Actually, it was 1923. I remember, because... you got quite an attitude, boy. No offense... But I don't like people in uniforms. Well, how would you like to wear one yourself? It's real simple, westphall. I need somebody to train my men how to ride them machines. You're the man can do that. The dream department's down the hall. What I saw of your boys, they wouldn't know a clutch from a horse's ass. I want you to listen to me real good, son. I come down here to offer you a deal. You can spend the next year of your life in the army's fresh air and sunshine, or you can rot your ass right here in jail with your friend the sheriff. So why don't you make your pick? Me, in the army? You got to be kidding. All right, gentlemen, are we feeling lucky? I'm putting down $1.00. What do you have? ♪ You're too modest and just too very, very... ♪ Cut the corn, cartucci. ♪ Webster's dictionary ♪ Happy days are here again. Ah. Amen. No more shoveling ground biscuits and getting kicked for my trouble. And the smell. Your horse said the same thing about you... I think it's great we're the first motorcycle unit. Homemade cookies. Want one? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Me, me, me, me. I'll take one. Doesn't he just scream army material? So this is your bunk? Listen, if anyone tries to mess with you, you let me know. I'll take care of them. There are some open bunks down there, corporal. Yeah? Whose is this? It's, uh, mine, sir. Now it's mine. Hey, jailbird, rumor has it you're partial to convertibles. Forget about it. He don't stand a chance in hell. Need a hand with that? I can manage, thanks. Oh, it's you. That was quite a show you put on last week. Thank you. And I see you've joined up. Well, I got the sudden urge to do something good for my country. Well, you must be such a brave young fellow. I'll take that, corporal. Looks like the fun is about to begin. I won't be able to join you, beryl Ann. There you are. You're a lucky man, Jack. It's captain to you, corporal. Right. Captain. Sorry. I'm still new at this... Captain. Does he make you call him captain, too? I'll see you tonight. Yeah, let's go dancing. Dancing? Dancing sounds like fun. Ten-hut! Stand at attention, soldier! Hands out of your pockets! Hands out of your pockets! Heels together, back straight, chin up, and wipe that stupid grin off your face. Ha ha ha ha! You've been talking to the colonel's daughter? I know you think you're quite a star, corporal westphall, but in the army, the only stars we've got sit right up here. You understand that, soldier? Permission to speak... Sir. What is it, corporal? Between you and me, I find a shameful lack of privacy in the latrine area. Actually, this morning I found this... a shell in my scrambled eggs. Fall in line. It ruined my whole day. Come. Captain hassler with corporal westphall, sir. At ease, gentlemen. Corporal westphall, I thought we ought to have a little chat before you get started. The army has its own way of doing things, and you'll be expected to adhere to the regulations governing this base. Listen to me, boy! You foul up, you go awol, you so much as scratch your ass with the wrong hand, you're going to land in leavenworth. That's the army's idea of prison. You got a job to do. Anything you need to get it done will be supplied by the army. Any questions? There's a motorcycle race at Daytona next week. Maybe I could take a day, two at most... dismissed, corporal. So that means no, right? Wait outside, westphall. Begging your pardon, sir, but corporal westphall's an insult to army standards. I couldn't agree with you more, but I need him. That being the case, sir, I respectfully request transfer back to a horse outfit. Request denied. You keep him in line. To make better soldiers out of your men. Yes, sir. Attention! At ease, gentlemen. You've all met corporal westphall. You're aware of his skills on a motorcycle. The same way he's caught your eye, he's also caught the army's. He's going to be training you. They're all yours, hotshot. Ecchh. Just out of curiosity... How many of you have been on a motorcycle before the army got this little bee in its bonnet? We're expert horsemen. That's what we've been trained for. Is that a fact? What's your horse's name, pal? Clementine. Clementine. That's cute. From here on in, this is Clementine. What... what is this? That's underbelly armor, corporal. We jump off the bikes and lay them down to deflect the bullets. First learn to ride them before you jump off them. All right. Throttle, brake, foot clutch, shift. Let's ride. That's the wave of the future? Get a horse! Got to hand it to you. How'd you convince the army to get you out of prison? Just told the colonel the truth... he needed me to train his men. You got the gift. Indeed I do, Willis, my boy. Sam, these are on the army. Ok. The army let you buy drinks? How did they put it? Anything I need, I got. They love my ass. All right, boys. Now it's time to play a little game to test your dexterity. And here we go. All right. It's hot, and you're thirsty. Pull this off and you drink. Who's first? I'll give it a try, corporal. Right. You're up, slick. All right, Brooks! Whoo! Yeah! Come on! Yeah! Yeah! Go, man! All right, who's next? All right, you. You! You! You, you're next. There's one thing I forgot to tell you... if you do blow it, you lose a piece of your uniform. No way. I'm not taking off my shirt, pants... nothing. Come on, Maguire, let's see that poolroom tan. Take it off, boy! Take it off! Off! Off! Off! Off! Off! Off! Off! Off! Off! Off! All right. A pretty fair test of balance. There goes my pants. Do you know where westphall is? All right! Let's see, we've tested your balance, your dexterity... What about their balls? Attention! Jack, grab a beer and join us. Do you have an explanation for this, westphall? Sure, Jack. I'm training the men. You're off base without permission, these men are drunk in... And out of uniform in the middle of the day, and you must be pretty God damn stupid, too, because I warned you... this is the army! Get them out of here. Get back in uniform now! I told you they love my ass. That's mine! Tom, you old skunk, down here twice in one week. Can't stand the heat back in Washington? It's hot there, all right, but it's not the weather. Arthur Bridges from the state department. Glad to meet you, colonel. What's going on, tom? I've seen that look before. Arthur will explain. The girl is Claire Tate. Her father is Dr. Philip Tate, the leading authority on atomic research in this country. The bomb? We're not the only ones working on it. So are the Germans. The Tates have been kidnapped. Our sources in the Spanish underground inform us Franco's negotiating a trade for them with Hitler. We can't let that happen. We believe the Tates are being held here, in an old fortress. There's only one road in, a narrow horse trail. It's completely inaccessible by car. We can't parachute troops in. The only way out is on foot. It's a three-day walk to the border. I see. You want to send in the cavalry. Not exactly. We can't send the cavalry without creating an international incident. But this is the perfect opportunity for your mechanized unit. Motorcycles? There's a big international motorcycle race coming up in bilbao. The course winds through the cantabrian mountains not far from the fortress. Your men will enter as civilian racers. We couldn't ask for a better cover. And when does this motorcycle race start? Two weeks. Two weeks? Two weeks? These men have never seen action, let alone on motorcycles. They're expecting a miracle. That's exactly what they'll get, but not with westphall's ass in the brig. I want him training those men. Captain, I don't care what it takes to get this done. Yes, sir. Mind if I borrow that? You got lucky, westphall. Don't tell me. The army wants to cut me another deal. For some reason, the colonel likes you. The colonel's not my problem. Well, that's what I'm here to talk about. How would you like to walk, westphall? No jail, no army, just roaring down that open highway going nowhere like before? Christmas in July, Jack? What's the catch? The catch is... You got to get past me. All you got to do is whip my ass, and you're out of here. Nice try, Jack, but I ain't buying it. I take a poke at an officer, and I go up the river. Forget about rank. Is this for real, Jack? You bet. I'm going to kick your ass. Yeah, right. What? Devers ok this deal? Signed, sealed, delivered. If you want these back... You know where you can get them tomorrow morning. Let's go, corporal. ♪ You're just too marvelous ♪ ♪ too marvelous for... ♪ You're in over your head now. I'm shaking in my boots. I'll see you around, Jack. Fight! Fight! Come on! Come on! Sorry to interrupt you, sir. Begging your pardon, ma'am. What is it? Who's winning? You keep me posted, sergeant. Daddy, what's going on? Nothing that concerns you, beryl Ann. Soup is excellent tonight, Elizabeth. Come on! Come on! Let's go. Come on. Jesus, corporal, what are you fighting him for? He's the armed forces champ. Now you tell me. Give it up, westphall. Save yourself the humiliation. Where I'm from, this is fun on a Saturday night. Excuse me, Mrs. Devers. Well? Hmm. Keep monitoring the situation. Yes, sir. What are the odds? 6-to-1. Put me in for 10 bucks. Hassler 6-to-1. Make it 20. Your hat, sergeant. Begging your pardon, Mrs. Devers. Daddy. Carry on, sergeant. You ready to quit? Hell, no! I feel like a million bucks. Throw me back in. They still at it? If you'll excuse me, Elizabeth, I think I'll check the horses. I'll go with you. You help your mother, beryl Ann. Captain. Sir. What the hell's going on here? I was just discussing the motorcycle project with corporal westphall. Sir. Sergeant. Yes, sir? Get these men cleaned up. I saw that flame through the window, and I thought there was a fire in here. What happened to your face? Cut myself shaving. Oh. So did Jack. These things just don't look that hard to ride. They can be full of surprises. So surprise me. Take me for a ride. Hey, maybe you could show me how. I doubt it's possible for me to fall any lower in your daddy's graces, but that would do it. You wait much longer, I'll have to find somebody else to teach me. Aah! All right. Be careful! I am. Now, I'm going to give you a very important lesson in riding a motorcycle. You accelerate with your foot, see? With your foot? Yeah. Right. See, like this. Oh, my gosh. Ok, you have it? Yeah, yeah, I'm ready. You sure? Yes! This is what you do. Let the clutch out. All right? You ready to give it a try? Yeah! All right, get off. Now, you sit on there. Got it? Good. Put your foot on this. This is a foot clutch. When you let the clutch out, give it a little gas. Ok. Ready? Go! Ohh! The brake is on the right! Oh, wait. Wait. Oh, shoot. Ok, bring it back. Where are you? Come back! What? Look out! Oh, shoot! Ohh! No, wait. Come here! Whoo-hoo! You got it! I'm pretty good at this! Right through here. Look out! Whoa! Whoa! I'm going to hit you. Come back! Aah! Ha ha ha! Whoo-hoo-hoo! You got it! I'll be damned if I didn't pass on the gift. I got it! Oh, my God! Aah! Oh, my God. Ain't that hard to ride, huh? Oh, full of surprises. Oh, gosh. It's getting late. I guess I'd better be getting back. Come on! Come on, just... What does this have to do with motorcycle riding? Whoa! Whoa! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo! Ow! Riding a motorcycle is lots of fun, right? Wind blows through your hair, girls like it. You could also get killed on one! Get back on that barrel! Ride it like you mean business! Damned if you ain't starting to sound almost army. Watch your mouth, novak. When will you let them ride? When I think they're ready. I think they're ready now. If you don't like my training methods, let's kill this romance right now. Let's take a walk, corporal. Let's go, Brooks! Take a break, men. At ease, westphall. Have you ever heard of the campeonato del mundo? Toughest road race in Europe. Why? The army wants six of us in that race. I said it's the toughest road race in Europe. You guys don't stand a chance. Why would the army be interested in the del mundo? What I'm about to tell you, westphall... Could get me court-martialed. When we cut this deal, nobody said anything about suicide. This isn't an invitation. You'll do as ordered. I'll get your boys up on motorcycles, but I ain't going to Spain! Not hungry? It's the finest milk-fed veal. The colonel brought it from Germany. Perhaps it's the company she finds distasteful. I apologize for the primitive accommodations. Fortunately, it's only temporary. Who the hell are you? Colonel muhl, ss. You have nothing to fear from me, doctor, as long as you cooperate. I myself have daughters, and I will never let any harm... Come to them. You're up early, Jack. I never went to bed. Where are these bikes you're taking to Spain? They've been ordered direct from the factory. Isn't that just like the army? Entering a world-class road race with stock bikes right off the showroom floor. What's wrong with that? Every racer blueprints his engine. Speak English, westphall. It means to modify your bike. Beef up your engine. Put your personal stamp on it. How long does blueprinting take? If we start tonight, we might make it by race time. Tonight? That's impossible. The bikes won't be here till next week. Bust a goiter, Jack. I can handle it. It's going to take persuading on my part and cash on yours. That's not a problem. How are you going to explain it to the colonel? I'll just tell him it's part of your little program. Hell, he already thinks you're a screwball anyway. All right, Willis, what you got on your bike, let's see. I don't know, 800 bucks? If you were to sell it, what would you sell it for? I wouldn't sell it. Come on. Sell it for what, $100 over what you got invested? My girl maybe, but not my motorcycle, colonel. Captain. Whatever. It's kind of like cutting off a right nut. You know how it is. It's not just a motorcycle. It's your best friend. It takes you anywhere you want to go, understands your problems, keeps you company, and it don't talk back. So say you'd take... 800 times 2? I knew you'd understand. $1,600? Sold! Pay the man. Next. To be a good biker, you got to know everything about them. Gus and I will teach you how to tear them apart and put them back together. You'll know every square inch. Pick your bikes. Mine. I got a driving permit. This is too easy. I'm telling you, with this new scope, I could see a nose hair at 500 yards. Why are they showing us all this new equipment? A soldier never questions why, a soldier's job is do or die. I got to test detonators tomorrow. You really think we're going to see some action? Let's go, brother. Yes, sir! See that? Whoo! All right! Want one? No beer for you, Gus. You're underage. Here, buddy. Thanks, grady. Not so tight, Maguire. Now here. Yeah. Thank uso. All right. Hey, hey. Captain, buy you a beer? Thanks. I'll be damned. You're human after all. Don't let the grease stains fool you. Jesus, ain't she a peach? Never thought we'd actually make it. Well, we did, Jack. All right, gentlemen, let's take 'em for a ride. Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

Good job, boys. Drinks are on me. You're on your own now. These men are going back to base. Move out! Are you ok? I'm sorry. I didn't mean to run you off the road. Crashing's getting to be a habit with us. You know, if you wanted to ask me out, I do have a telephone. This is going to need a tow truck. Come on. I'll give you a ride. Let's go, young lady. Young lady? Don't even think about it. You're on the back. Dixie, go get it. Rog, it's grady. There's a convertible stuck out route 2. I need a tow back to base. All right, thanks. Bye. Looks like you're moving up in the world, huh? You stay away from her, Gus. I saw her first. Last installment from the army. I do appreciate this, grady. Gus... What's the toughest decision you ever had to make in your life? Whether to marry my wife or her sister. I'm serious. Well... when a few fellas wanted me to team up with them in a motor parts business, but, uh, I decided I wasn't the partnering type. Those boys made a bundle. Do you regret it? You kidding? Give up all this? Anyways, that was a long time ago. A man shouldn't cry in his beer, grady. Why do you want to know for, anyway? No reason. How you feeling? Mmm, I'm fine. What are you doing? Listen. Mmm, and it's such a wonderful night. Feels like we're the only two people alive. I know a place where we can be. Is it far? This is a beautiful lake. Yeah, it is. Only problem is the sharks, but other than that, it's... it's a beautiful lake. No, I'm serious.

I don't like to be fenced in, either. No, it's... it's not like that. It's... This is about me, facing my responsibilities. Yeah. Yeah. Beryl Ann, I... stop before I say something you'll regret. Bye. What's going on here? Beats me. Orders are to load them. Load this one, too. Ok, corporal. Grady! I'm glad you made it back. I didn't think I was going to get a chance to say goodbye. Could you do me a favor? Mail this to my mother if I don't come back? You'll make it back. I'll make sure of it. Let's go. We're moving out. Jack, you win. I'm in. Wrong. You lose. You're out. You didn't want to be part of this mission, and you're not. Come on, Brooks. Jack, you need me. We'll be fine. Captain, what's holding us up? You're sending these men on a dangerous situation on motorcycles. I should be with them. I can ride better than them. If something goes wrong, I can fix it on the spot... Sir. We can use all the help we can get. Mount up. Come on, Jack. Let's get it done. What's slowing you, westphall? Come on, grady! Forgot my... you lost something? Yeah. I forgot something at the base. Let's go, grady! Come on! You joining us, corporal? I said I would, didn't I? What's holding you up? Think that engine's ok? What, are you scared of flying, westphall? Bullshit! Let's go then! Come on! Let's go, son. She knows she's not supposed to be here. Let's move it out! At the starting line, set your odometers to zero. You should hit the turnoff between 60 and 61 Miles. You all right, westphall? From here to the fortress is a half a day's ride. Now, the approach is not heavily guarded, but be careful. Brooks, pick off any guard on the roof. They'll never know what hit them. Novak, locate that receiver and take it out fast. Broadwater, make sure nobody gets in his way. Maguire, lay charges on the trail in case they chase us. Cartucci, westphall, you stick with me. We'll locate the Tates and hightail it out of there. It's 40 Miles to the French border. We'll be waiting for you right here... At valcarlos. Any questions? I take it you don't care much for flying. So will it bother you when we have to parachute out? Ah, just kidding! I couldn't resist. Parachute. Hey, the beer's good. Uh-oh, trouble. What's he doing? He's looking at the bikes, that's what he's doing. He's coming over. No problem. We don't sprechen sie. Guten tag. The harley-davidsons... I was admiring them outside. They are beautiful machines. Thank you. Tell me... What kind of fuel will you run? What kind of fuel? I'm curious. I do a little racing myself. 72 octane. Now you can sleep tonight. I know harley-Davidson very well. Some of your modifications seem rather extreme. For instance, fly wheels. Why did you make... That's privileged information. We don't want to give away all of our secrets before the race, now, do we? Perhaps you're right. Auf wiedersehen. Careful, westphall. Told me to act like a racer. I was acting like a racer. Know what, Jack? I could win this race if I wanted to. But I guess you won't know till I get to the church, now, will you? Hey! Those guys are good! No kidding! Broadwater, have you seen grady? Ah, he's way up front. Beats riding ponies, don't it? Whoo! Whoo! Where's westphall? He's not here, captain. I knew we couldn't trust him. Evening, girls. I got to tell you, there's nothing I hate more than being talked about when I'm not around to defend myself. I was in the lead, Jack. Jackpot. Everything's here. Wrench. 7/8. This is going to hurt me as much as it hurts you, baby. Say goodbye to 14 coats of the finest hand-mixed lacquer money can buy. Ah, it's easy, grady. Just like this. Easy. Brooks, come on, let's go. Let's get the armor on. Broadwater, you got any pliers? And a hammer. What the hell are you doing? It's rugged terrain out there in those mountains. This will give us extra traction. You don't see any spare tires around here. Be careful or we'll all end up walking. So quit barking in my ear. You're spoiling my concentration. You know, westphall... Beryl Ann is a very special girl. I'd hate to see her get hurt. Good night. Those Americans with the harley-davidsons, have you seen any of them pass through? Not yet. Shoo! Why don't we just ride down the side of a house? Motorcycles weren't built for this shit. We don't have time to ride around this Mountain. I didn't say we weren't going. I just said motorcycles weren't built for this. Whoo-hoo! You ok? Aah! Let's bring those Spanish dames in! Whoo-hoo! Where are those Spanish dolls? Wait! Wait! I smell gas. Oh, God. Get off your bike! I don't like this. It's too quiet. No need for you to go in, westphall. Try and stop me. You know how to use that thing? Please. All right. Let's go. Padlock. Look out. What's the matter, don't they teach this in the army? Let's go. Oye, Raul. Cigarillos tambien. Did you have to kill him? Sorry, Raul. Real good army rescue... they're gone. I got eyes, westphall. What's the situation? German equipment, German code book. The Tates... where are they? No tengo armas. Mira, no tengo pistola. Do you speak English? Raul. Raul habla ingles. He's saying some guy named Raul speaks English. Just tell me where they are. Tell me where the Tates are. ¡Santa Maria! ¡Santa Maria! Great. Now he's praying. Estacion. Estacion. Show me. Show me where. Se ido a Santa Maria estacion aqui. They're in Santa Maria? Si, señor. Train? Si, señor. God damn it. Come on, we got a train to catch. Let's go. Shit! Did I hit anything? Go! I owe you one, grady. Come on! God damn it! We got to catch that train. Westphall... You come with me. The rest of you give cover. Catch up at the train. Let's go. Great. How we getting out of this? We'll work around them. No time. I got a better way. All right. You really think you can hit it from here? Not from here, westphall. We're going to get a lot closer. Nice shooting, Jack. You been practicing? All right, Jack. Now it's my turn. Grab my bike! What? Grab my bike! Got it. Don't do anything crazy. You might fall. Wait for me! The train is slowing down. What the hell? Is this a trick? Do you take me for a fool? Aah! Don't move. What took you so long? Quiet. Who are you? They tell me I'm the army. They're on to us. Move. You ok back there? Put your arms around my waist. You'll be fine. Lean into the bike. Hold your knees against it. There they are, boys. Brooks, broadwater, double up with the Tates. Good luck, captain. Get them to that plane fast. Westphall, you stick with me. We'll ride rear guard. See you in France, captain. Move out! We've got company! The fun never stops. They're coming around. Let's split up. Let's take cover in the trees! Flare out about 100 yards, cut a hard "u," and ride straight at me. Pass me on my left. Go! Aah! Yaah! Yaah! Bikes on the left side. They made it. There's a girl. They got the Tates. They did it. Where's the others? Last thing I saw, they were behind us. Load up. Let's go. I'm picking up German on the radio. We can't wait any longer. There it is. Last one there buys the beer. There they are. There they are. Aah! That Nazi will cut us to pieces. Take off! He's going back! Those are my men out there. I'm sorry. The Tates are my first priority! Take off now! Let's play chicken. Get going. Hang on, Jack! I think Claire Tate's got an eye for you! Well, if she does, westphall, you stay the hell away from her. Come on, grady! Come on, boys. This man's hurt. Grab my hand, captain. Come on! Let's go! Get in! You know how I feel about flying. Get in now! There goes a perfectly good bike! Are you back? Did you doubt it? New bike? It's a long story. Oh, yeah? Well, I got time. Oh, yeah? You got time for a swim? You read my mind. Don't even think about it. You're on the back. Of the horse? Now don't you tell me you can't ride a horse. I can ride a horse. It's just that... I'm a motorcycle rider, you know? Horse is a piece of cake. Oh, yeah? Well, come on. All right. Go. Come on. Whoa!
