Walk Cheerfully This man has stolen my wallet. You shouldn't steal. Give back what you took. I stole nothing and I have nothing to return Can we check him? In my opinion, he should let us. I have nothing, see? And you calling me a thief. You shouldn't participate. Take care! It came out well. With all those people around it's been difficult to hide it. That's a pretty car, one day I would like to drive one. It's a beautiful ring. Shut up, I'm not interested in the ring. Wouldn't you like a ring like this? If you marry me, I will give you a ring as nice as this. Tea. How stupid, to get angry for such a small thing. I'm not as unashamed as you. Let's beat Chiha, he attacked Gunpei. It's not me who should avenge Gunpei. Kengi is always strange when he meets a girl. You should be careful because he can find another girl. Chieko, be calm. I'll do my rounds now. For me its better to live with a girl like you. - Let's go play golf next sunday. - I must work. Maybe the boss was joking. You should be more patient. Your works helps us live. Sunday It seems easy. I'm going, see you in the next hole. Here comes, be careful with your driving. Sorry, may I accompany you to your home? No thanks, it was just a scare. I'm sorry I ruined your pic-nic. I'm sorry you took the trouble of taking us home. I saw you before in Ghinza, while you bought a pretty ring. I was just making a delivery for my director. I couldn't afford something so expensive. He can do anything he wants. Shut up! I'm thinking! Six can very well beat a weak one. There's no effort. Give us the wallet. "Kengi the knife" you're courageous, we aren't that persuasive. The Next Sunday I'm sorry to have bothered you. Last sunday I ruined your pic-nic I would like it if you pardon me. I'm glad to have met a girl like you. Me too. Its the first time I feel safe, protected. My colleagues are all arrogant and improper. The girl has got the boss. She is pulling his hair. You're lucky, Yasue. You've found a good man. But beware, they call him "Kengi the knife". He's dangerous. Don't say foolish things. You're deceiving yourself. If you don't believe me, look at the tatoo in his wrist. Do you have a moment? Director, I know you like Yasue. Director, I will make Yasue yours. Tonight I'll send her to the hotel "The Moon". You can tell me the truth. You're only wasting your time with that girl, right? I've really fallen in love. When I'm with her, I try things I never did before. Love is not a problem, but you shouldn't be that bad. To fight and steal is to be ok? Shall we just have fun that way? Sorry, Senko. Right now I'm like a stranger. I don't want to see her. If she comes, tell her I'm gone. I don't know, he went out this morning and hasn't come back. He is still with that girl? Poor girl, she will become our boss. I made a joke on her. I've send her to the hotel "The Moon." A little gift to our boss. What does the girl has to do with the hotel? I'm doing it for you, because I love you. Forget her, I beg you! Don't touch me, I won't allow it. I'm not good, but my heart is true. I love you truly. You only like your type. You are so selfish you can only love your type. I will only see you again when you are honest. Just after you left, Chieko came desperate. Look what she did. Since today we end this kind of life. I wish to work honestly. I no longer wish to live this horrid life. It would be better for you and Yasue to work and live honestly. Aren't you a little selfish? Instead of giving me this stolen stuff, why don't you give me a way to change my life? If you are sure of your decision, look for an honest job. To not be a mute, don't shout. Are you kidding? I'm not shouting. Senko, are we ok? Boss, will you give me some money? I don't have money for you, I can't give you anything. If you have money for Senko, why not for me? Besides the time you've spent with that chick, think in those who work for you. Now you don't have the strength to defeat me. Are you betraying me? Dismissal note for the lady Yasue Sughimoto. I will have to search for a new job. Yashue and Kenji are now looking for work. Nice car, right? I now work in "Okazachi Building" Now you are working for a good society. You've must have had a lot of preparation for that work. And you? And finally Kenji's work... How brave, will he get to finish that job? Calm down, they've assumed it. They've assumed it after having to tolerate my chat. It's been a long time since you see Kenji. You should call him from work. Everybody talks well of you. That I owe it to you. Now that you are honest you should consider seeing Yasue. Not yet, I must work more. The next work must be important, but it can't be too tough. You always talk about Kenji. I would prefer if you forgot him. The present is more important, forget the past. He's found a humble job, and if we called him he wouldn't come. I don't think so, we are all ambitious, he also want to improve. Please, can you give us a hand? We used to be friends. It's a big job, we'll all win. I've already told you no. I hate when you are around me. Go now! I wouldn't believe both of you were so blind not to see a good business. Remember that the crystals you clean up there, never become diamonds. You've offended him. I don't think you can understand our reasons. I wouldn't imagine you would cure me. I also wouldn't imagine you to take such a job. I would had prefered you saw me when I had a better job. You shouldn't be ashamed, it is an honest job. They've come. I'll figure it out, you escape now. Do you know Gunpei and Chieko? You must come to the police headquarters. I haven't hidden it just to escape. You'll tell it all in the headquarters. I'm sorry this happens the first day we meet again. If you take him, then I want to come also. He's crazy, don't hear what he says. If you abandon me now, I will hate you forever. I want to clean my past and live peacefully. Senko is right, we first must clean our past. Then I will come to you. It isn't too bad. It is like if we went out a little at a time. Cure yourself, I recommend it. I will be waiting for you, cure yourself. Some Months Later. Soon I will be free, I can't wait... You are always in my thoughts, Kenji. It's useless to read it so many times, he'll come today. Thanks. Finally I'm free. The End Thanks to Gandalfmetal and Ketamino for the spanish subs. Translated to english by RaulQ
