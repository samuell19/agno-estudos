You're late this morning. You almost missed the kids. Here's your breakfast. Oh what are the headlines? Let's see who did what to whom today? - Is Benji here yet? - Yes Benji's here yet. - Cindy he's here. - Well he won't be for long if you don't stop that yelling. You know what happens if your father walks in. - I don't think Daddy understands about us and Benji. - I don't think you understand what an understatement you've just made. - What does understatement mean? - It means don't yell down the hall. - Where's Benji? - And don't yell in the kitchen. Do you want your father in here? - No but he's coming anyway. We've gotta hide Benji. - Oh phenomenal. - Quick he's right behind me. - We could put him outside. - No he's not through with his breakfast. He'd just stand there and scratch on the door. Here give him to me. Bring him over here and we'll put him on my lap, come on. That's it, come on. Good boy Benji. Down, okay. And stay balanced, it could mean your neck. There. The bowl, get the bowl. - Paul, Cindy! Come on kids, time to go. Okay, what's going on? - You heard your father children, it's time to go. Don't forget your books Paul. Now you kids run along. When your father says, it's time to go, it's time to go. - She's right Paul, it is time to go. - [Paul] I guess so. Bye Mary. - Bye Paul. Have a good day, do good on your spelling test. - Bye Mary. - Bye hon, and don't forget we want you to look real pretty at the recital this afternoon so don't get that dress messy. - I won't. Come on Dad it's time to go. - I believe I asked you a question now. - What was that Dad? - What is going on in here? - He's right Paul, I remember him asking that. - All right gang now your hiding something from me. What is it? Starting with what you've got under that table Mary. - Yes Doctor. - What's that? - It's a bowl. - A bowl? - An empty bowl. - I know it's empty Mary. What was in it? - A snack. - A snack. Mary how do you think we're ever going to get them to eat a decent breakfast if they know they can come in here afterwards and have something they like better. - Well I never really thought about it that way. - Well try to think about it will you Mary? No more snacks after breakfast all right? - You're right, absolutely right, no snacks. I'm sorry kids, no snacks after breakfast and that's final. - I'll guess we'll just have to grin and bear it. - Sure is gonna be hard to give up. - Get to school. Didn't you hear your father say it's time to go? (laughing) - See you later Mary. (sighing) - Well Benji, I guess between the two of us we got you another reprieve. (barking) I'm glad too. (laughing) Okay, down you go. It's a shame we have to go through this because he's really a nice man. (barking) He's just a little stubborn on some things. (barking) Oh gonna eat and run huh? One of these days I'm gonna follow you just to see where you go. (laughing) you've got more independence than most people and more charm. Have a good day. We'll see you in the morning. (upbeat music) (cat screeching) (barking) (groaning) (clapping) - Stop it! Stop it, you leave my Sweetie Petey alone. Oh, you primitive uncultured cur. I'm gonna tell her to go for you one day and she'll do something dreadful. Then you'll be sorry. You have no decency! He was late today. (upbeat music) (barking) - Hey Butch. Come here boy. (barking) Come on boy, come on. Hey. Look I saved you some popcorn. (barking) I saw some kids by here earlier. They wanted to see you do some tricks, but I'm sure they'll be around another day. Here. Go get it, come on pick it up. You lazy thing you. Hey guess what, Nancy and I set the date. In two months I'm gonna be a married man. (barking) Yeah, well your day will come. Some cute little Pekingese will come along and sweep you right off your feet. Climb on up here and let me tell you all about it. (barking) Suit yourself. See you tomorrow then. (barking) Just remember when she gets you I tried to give you a little advice. (upbeat music) - Oh hi Sam. Hey where've you been? You let me sleep too long. I ought to been in there getting ready for the rush. Today's a home cook stew special and you know how long that takes. (barking) (laughing) You and Margret. She used to say to me, "Bill the whole world ain't "gonna fall down if you miss the rush one day." Still if she happens to be wrong I'd better get a move on. I'll get your pay, it's right inside here. Here you are. (barking) You're welcome. Be on time tomorrow, it's meatloaf day. (upbeat music) (barking) (upbeat music) (rustling) (metal grinding) - [Henry] I thought you said you could pick it. [Riley] It didn't work, but this will. - [Henry] How are we gonna lock it when we get inside? - [Riley] Why lock it? Nobody in their right mind wants in this place and I might want out in a hurry. - [Linda] Won't you go any faster? Somebody's gonna see us. - [Henry] You got it, try it. (door squeaking) Well go on in. - It was your idea, you go first. - I can't. - How come? - [Henry] You're blocking the door. - Oh for goodies sakes I'll go first. Let's just get inside before somebody sees us. Shut the door. - [Henry] This is really nice. - You got weird taste Henry. - It's hard to believe nobody's even been in this house in over 40 years. - Except old man Powell and his lovely wife's head. - Will you leave the haunted house stuff to the kids? - I was just joking. I hope. - Hey. Look at this. Isn't that nice? I'll take this to my girlfriend, it's great. - This whole place is great. It's perfect, I think Mitch will like it a lot. This looks like a good room to set up in. - [Riley] I don't know Linda Sue, seems like we're right under the whole town's noses. - [Linda] I told you not to call my Linda Sue anymore, it's just Linda. And especially don't call me that in front of Mitch. - [Riley] I'm sorry. - [Linda] Now look I think if we're careful we can go in and out through the back with almost no chance of being seen. - Well at least it's got a roof over it. That beats being out in the woods with a bunch of chiggers. - If it's all the same I'll take the chiggers. - Well I think Mitch will like it and he'll make the final decision. I'm glad you thought of it Henry. Come on let's go. - All right. - Just for the record I ain't glad you thought of it Henry. This place gives me the screaming creeps. (barking) - Oh yeah? (mischievous light music) - He doesn't look like his feeling's are hurt to me. - Well they are. I can tell. He's just too polite to say. - I don't think he cares where he eats as long as he eats. - But he's always eaten inside with us. - Well I'm sorry kids but yesterday scared me out of 10 year's growth. Do your realize what would've happened if your father found him under that table? - He'd have fainted. - He would've fired me on the spot. - Oh he'd never fire you. - If he did he'd have to fire us too. - Well that's very nice but it's a bit impractical. - What does impractical mean? - It means that this is the best solution to the problem for right now so let's not talk about it anymore okay? - Couldn't we explain to Daddy and make him understand about Benji? - [Mary] Honey to your father Benji's just a stray. - But he's not I mean not really. And even if he is, what's wrong with that? - Just because Uncle Chris got bit one time. - [Mary] Your Uncle Chris almost died that one time. - But this is different. - Yeah Daddy says we shouldn't think all teachers are bad just because we don't like Miss Guildy so why does he think all dogs are bad just because one bit Uncle Chris? - Kids, if he thought it was the best for you your father would give you the shirt off his back. His shirt. (gasping) I forgot to iron his shirt. Now I'm in real trouble. Now don't you stay out here too long. - We won't. - Is she gone? - Yeah let's do our plan. - Okay, I'll hold Benji and you go get it. - Okay. Hurry up with that, we've got a whole side to go and she'll be back any minute. - I'm going as fast as I can. You want it to look good don't you? - Of course silly, but I want my side to look good too. - We may not even get to your side today. He's got terrible tangles. - Benji what have you been into? - I think it was a fight with a giant wad of chewing gum. - Okay kids you better get on up front before your father comes back here looking for you. Well what is this? - [Paul] Close your eyes. - Now that's very clever. I catch you into something, I close my eyes, and you get rid of the evidence right? - We're not doing anything wrong. We just want to show you something. - Please close your eyes. - Okay but hurry. - [Cindy] Turn him around, he's the wrong side out. - [Paul] I know, I know. - Come on Benji. - Now stand right there. - Okay Mary. - What do you think? - I think... You're gonna have to give me a hint. - You meant you can't even tell the difference? - But you've gotta, it's important, look. Come on Benji, turn around. This is before, and this is after. - Oh you brushed him out, sure. But you should've showed me before before you showed me after. No he looks real nice on this side. - We didn't have time to finish my side. - Does it make him not look like a stray? - I never really, oh now I see. This is for your father's benefit isn't it? - We figured if we made him look real nice then Daddy would like him. - We even bought a real dog brush with our allowance. - Kids I'm afraid the problem is a bit more complicated than just making him look nice. - It'll help won't it? - Well-- - What else do we have to do? - Daddy is wrong isn't he? - Now Cindy I never said-- - We have to be right, 'cause you're on our side. - And you always say right wins over wrong. - Oh boy. - [Dr. Chapman] Paul, Cindy. - We'll finish this another time. Now you better get back there before he gets out here or there won't be another time. Go on. - See you later, bye Mary. - Scoot. - Bye Mary. - Bye bye. - Oh here, you wouldn't let him spend a whole day half and half would you? - Sometimes I wonder who's in charge around here. Me or them? (barking) (cat screeching) (barking) (groaning) - Get away from her, get away from her you commonplace barbarian! Sweetie Petey's going to get you one day and I'm going to let her because you're nothing but a ruffian and you're not nice. He looked like he had a good brushing - Well I can tell you've given some thought to our little talk yesterday. Got yourself all dolly dooed up and slicked down. (barking) Oh don't tell me, I know when a guy's out looking. When you find one you like you gotta bring her by here so we can go through some of your paces. Show her how smart you are. That'll impress her. Roll over. That's a good boy. Oh now look what you've done. Got you all messed up. Can't have that can we? It's all gone, see? Besides I think you ought to get on with the search. Some lovely young thing's out there just waiting for you. (upbeat music) - Hey. Oh hi Sam. Sam you're gonna have to start looking for another client. I made a big decision last night. I decided that I'd worried enough about this place so I'm gonna shut her down. (barking) Well I can't say exactly when yet. You gotta take these big decisions one at a time. I figure a week or so or two until I make the decision, but it'll probably be next year or the year after before I close her up. I don't want to rush into anything. Here you are. (barking) (laughing) You're welcome. Hey you look different this morning. What'd you do fall in a lake or something? (laughing) (upbeat music) (barking) (calm music) (barking) (upbeat music) (barking) (upbeat music) (barking) (upbeat music) (barking) - Benji is that you? (barking) What in the world are you doing here at this time of day? Well well, what do we have here? I believe you've found yourself a girlfriend. Fine thing. I risk my neck feeding you breakfast every morning and what do you do? You go out and find another woman. (barking) Oh I guess there's no hard feelings. You look as if you need a good meal and a good brushing and I just happen to have the materials for both. And don't you sit there so smug looking as if you didn't plan it that way. Oh sure. You have to watch him, he's a sneak. I'll be back in a minute. Well Benji I'd say you've got a mighty highfalutin looking girlfriend here. You're not over your head are you, hmm? (laughing) Dumb question. Well if you're gonna be a regular we're gonna have to think of something to call you, but I don't know what it'll be. Now he was easy, he looks like a Benji. But you, you look like Park Avenue and I'm just not up on high class names. The closest I ever came to Park Avenue was when George used to tell me that some day he was gonna make enough money to take me to Tiffany's and buy me anything I wanted. Say we could call you Tiffany. To me that's about as high class as you can get. (barking) Then Tiffany it is. Now you two be on your way. I'm one feeding and a brushing behind on my chores. (barking) Life is just full of decisions isn't it? (barking) You're welcome, have a nice day. Hey you forgot your... (calm music) (barking) (barking) (barking) (upbeat music) (barking) (upbeat music) (barking) (rustling) - This place bothers me man. - Why? - [Riley] There really might be an old head floating around. Who knows? - [Henry] Do you think we ought to wait for him out here or go on inside? (barking) - [Riley] What was that? - [Henry] It was a simple question. Should we wait for him out here or should we go inside? - [Riley] You go on in, I'll stay out here for a while. Then again maybe I'll just mosey on home. - No don't be silly, come on. - [Riley] I'm not being silly, I heard something. - Maybe it's Mrs. Powell's lovely head rolling down the stairs. - That did it. - Oh come on. Look, Mitch and Linda Sue are gonna can us right off this thing if you don't start acting like you got some sense. - I got plenty of sense, it's guts I'm short on. I don't think I like this Mitch character anyway. - Well for the kind of money we're getting you don't have to like him. - Well I still if that's the best Linda Sue could do in the big city she should've stayed here at home. Hey wait a minute. - [Henry] What? - Come here Henry. Look at this. - What about it? - That sack wasn't dumped over like that yesterday. - Ah come on Riley I told you to knock that stuff off. I'm gonna go upstairs and take a look around. - Well you can walk calmly saying knock it off if you want to but where's your pudding cup? - My what? - Didn't you leave a pudding cup sitting on this chair? - I don't know, I probably took it with me. (door creaking open) - Yeah they're here. - [Riley] Hi Mitch. - Hi. Well this'll do fine. - I knew you'd like it. (chuckling) - Kind of looks like an old haunted house out of a movie doesn't it? You sure nobody ever comes here? - Just look around, nothing's been touched for years - Except your pudding cup. - What? - I said I think I'll eat a pudding cup. - Come in here Mitch. I thought this would be a good room to set up in. What do you think? - Yeah. This is great, it's shut off and we can use the light at night and nobody will see it right? - I thought you said we'd be through before night. We're not gonna be in here after dark are we? - I'm just covering all the bases Henry, you know? - Did I hear somebody mention night? - [Linda] Mitch look at this table. - Now don't go getting in a nervous fidget. We're gonna be out of here before dark. At least that's the plan. - I bet this is over 100 years old. You know the stuff in here must be worth a fortune. What's out there? - A sun porch. - Come here. - What for? - Plan or no plan I ain't staying in this place after dark. How many pudding cups are in a carton? - What? - How many pudding cups come in one of those little cardboard cartons? - How should I know Riley? - Well you bought it. Think about it, it's important. - Four I guess. - That's what I thought. There's one missing. - What do you mean there's one missing? - Okay, you ate one yesterday and I'm eating this one so there ought to be two in the sack right? - Right. How many Riley? - One. - One? Maybe they shorted us at the store. - No, you'd have noticed it. I'm telling you there's something with this place. - Don't be silly Riley there's a logical answer to all this. - The carton was short, it fell out of the sack, something. Don't bug anyone about it you hear? (rustling) Would you sit down, look relaxed, be quiet. - Do you want to see the rest of it? - No no this is all we'll use. It's perfect, just perfect. - This is definitely the place huh? - Yeah. You've got the time and the schedule right? - Right. - I'm going back to the city, I'll see you boys tomorrow. Come on. - Bye. - [Mitch] I want you to go back and stay with your parents. I'll see you in a couple of weeks. - I'll miss you. - Yeah. I'll miss you too but it's gonna be worth it. - "I'll miss you." Come on let's get out of here. - I can't think of anything I'd rather do. - Note, I'm leaving it right here on purpose. - And I'm sure it'll be there tomorrow on purpose too. Now come on let's go. Unless of course Mrs. Powell's lovely head gets hungry. (grunting) - [Riley] I really wish you wouldn't talk like that. (growling) (yelling) Come on cut it out Henry. - I got you didn't I? - Yeah you got me-- (calm music) - [Paul] But Daddy why? - [Dr. Chapman] Because that's just the way it has to be son. We don't know what he gets into, what germs he's carrying or really anything about him. He could be picking up diseases all over town and bringing them here. - But Daddy he's not, we know. - Honey, you never know. You can't see a disease. Believe me I've been there. It's just not worth the risk to the family. I'll tell you what, I'll get you any kind of dog you want and we'll build a fence in the backyard and-- - We don't want any kind of dog, we want Benji. Why can't we build a fence for Benji? - Well Mary and I talked about that. - I said I thought it would be cruel. - [Cindy] Why? - Honey. Benji is a very special kind of dog. He's been on his own a long time now. I think he'd very very unhappy if we penned him up. That's the hardest part about love sometimes. Doing what you know is right for the one you love even though it hurts you a whole lot. Now that's what your father's trying to do for you and that's what you should do for Benji if you love him. - It's just not fair. - [Dr. Chapman] Paul please try to understand, huh? - [Paul] I'm trying Dad. - Well maybe you'd better go look after your sister. Come on. Mary how do you know when you're right or wrong? Am I really doing what's best or am I just being a rotten heal. - [Mary] No sir, and yes sir. (dramatic music) (barking) - Come on let's get to school. A few minutes with Miss Guildy can take our minds off anything. (upbeat music) (meowing) - You... Well, is he ignoring you? (meowing) Oh. You come right back here this minute and chase my cat you inconsiderate irresponsible, oh. Do you want to give her a complex? Oh. - Well Butch you sure move fast. (barking) You sure got yourself a pretty little thing. Okay. Now sit up, sit up, come on, sit up, sit up. Hey, that's a good boy. Now she's trying to hide it, but I can tell she's impressed. (laughing) - Of course you realize I mean no offense to your young lady friend here, but I've felt with my many years of experience that I should tell you to think long and hard about this thing for a woman surely ties a man down. Of course as I recall, they usually make it worth while. And another thing, it's all bunk that old saying that two can live cheap as one. (upbeat music) - [Riley] I told you it wouldn't be there Henry. I told you that pudding cup would be gone and I'm fixing to be gone with it. - [Henry] Will you knock it off? You've said that three times. Now just shut up and keep writing. We're running late. - [Riley] Well you just tell me where it went. - How should I know? Maybe we got trained pudding cups. Some kid probably found that door unlocked. - You find me a kid that'll even walk in this place and that ain't the kid that's gonna do absolutely nothing but walk off with one half eaten pudding cup. - Would you write Riley? - [Riley] This would be hard enough to do if I was safe at home but it's practically impossible under these circumstances. - It's working though. - What do you mean? - I mean it's working. Doing it with the left hand so you can't trace the handwriting. Look at that you can't even read it so how can they trace it? Get out of there. - I'm sorry Henry. I don't like this place. I don't even think I like this deal and I'm just nervous that's all. - What's there to be nervous about? The pick up should've already been made. And Mitch will be back before long. Come here look at this. Huh? Your problem is you don't concentrate. You worry more about pudding cups. Okay. We gotta get you in position. You know where to go. - Yeah. I'll trade this place for a phone booth any day. What time? - In 45 minutes if you haven't heard from me make the delivery okay? - Okay. (laughing) (suspenseful music) - [Mitch] Hurry up. Come on move it. - Mitch this is wrong. - Shut the door. - [Linda] This isn't the way we planned it. - Stop squirming and get in there or someone's gonna get hurt. - Hey what is this, what are they doing here? - [Mitch] Just shut up. Linda take them in the other room. - No I won't shut up. They were supposed to be out in the country looking at a horse. Now what are they doing here? Linda? - [Linda] I don't know Henry, I promise I don't know. It's Mitch. - Well Mitch has got a lot of explaining to do or he's gonna have this whole thing in his lap. I bargained for a simple con game, not kidnapping. - Well you've got kidnapping, all of you. Henry you and your buddy wrote the note and you made the pick up and nobody in this town has ever even seen me. You got the picture? Now get those kids in there like I told you. - You don't have to shove them around. Come on kids. - And don't take your eyes off them. Put them on the sofa over there so we can see them from either room. - Can I take their gags off? - Yeah, one sound and they go back on. Where do you think you're going Henry? - Look I don't like this whole setup, but what's done is done. Now if you want that ransom I have to phone the delivery signal to Riley. - Henry, Henry! Have you forgotten this is my plan? No signal means deliver. - Well we changed it just in case you had a flat tire and you couldn't make the pick up. - Not true Henry, come on back. - No chance. - Hold it! I'll shoot. (suspenseful music) Just relax until Riley gets back, come on. In a few minutes that note will be delivered and we'll all be in this together. Come on in here and sit down. Henry. (suspenseful music) - [Linda] Mitch? - [Mitch] What? - Why didn't we do it the way we planned it? - [Mitch] 'Cause it wouldn't have worked, there wasn't enough time. He couldn't raise $100,000 in this hick town by seven o'clock if his own life depended on it. - [Linda] But you said he could before. - [Mitch] Well you wouldn't have done it otherwise, none of you would've so I did you a favor. - [Henry] Don't do many anymore. - [Mitch] Well I'm gonna go see what kind of groceries you've got in the sack out there. And no clever ideas out of you Henry. (clanging) (suspenseful music) (energetic music) (barking) (dramatic music) (phone ringing) - [Ted] And do you know whether they usually take the same route every day? - [Mary] If their pockets are empty they'll take the quickest possible way home to get a snack. - [Ted] And the quickest possible way home is what? - [Mary] That would be straight ahead to 18th and over Ridgewood-- - 18th, yeah. - [Mary] Or Mill Valley across to Tennessee. - [Ted] I see. - [Mary] Of course if they've got some money it's straight to Bessel's store. - Did they have any money this morning? - No I don't believe they did have. - [Dr. Chapman] Yes as a matter of fact they did, I gave them some to soften that business about the dog. - Oh. - Oh you did huh? - [Mary] Would you excuse me? - I hate to keep belaboring this but it's terribly important. I don't have to tell you, if there's anything at all you haven't told me. - Benji, what are you doing in here? I'm sorry Doctor, he's never been past the kitchen before. - Floyd maybe you better hold this. - Bad dog. Shame on you. Now you run along, go. (barking) No I don't have time to mess with you, now go on. (barking) Look Benji I know you can't understand but we've got an awful lot to worry about in here and I don't have any time to play and we don't need any other problems okay? (barking) That's a good boy. Bye bye. (barking) (phone ringing) (dramatic music) - [Ted] Doctor why don't you just relax for a few minutes, huh? Until the FBI agent gets here. - Yeah I understand. - Yeah. Floyd, got any word on that FBI guy yet? - Just that there's one on the way. - Oh boy this time of day it'll take him forever to get here. What about the patrols? - Nothing. - And the phone, what does it take to get those phone people moving? We gotta free that line. - They're working on it, shouldn't be long. - Why don't you go out and use the radio, huh? Until they get in. - Okay. Yeah Fred, go ahead. - [Ted] Any word? - Yeah I think I've got it all worked out unless they want it in special denominations. Then we may have a problem. - What kind of problem? - Nobody? - Well you see it's a matter of time. If we have to wait for them-- - Yeah okay. - To get in the bank in the morning-- - Thanks. Nothing on the people, so far nobody's seen anything. - Oh boy. (doorbell ringing) - I'll get it. - [Ted] No no Mary I'll get it. Yeah? - [Payton] Payton Murrah, FBI. - [Ted] Oh hi, Ted Samuels, Silver Creek Police. Come on in. You must've been halfway here when they called you. - [Payton] I almost was, I live out this way. - [Ted] Right over here. Dr. Chapman this is Payton Murrah of the FBI. - [Payton] How do you do? - [Ted] His attorney Mr. Bob Fielding. - How are you? - Mr. Fielding. - Housekeeper Mary Gruber. Mary also has been acting as sort of a governess for the kids since the doctor lost his wife. Doctor's sister and brother-in-law, Mr. And Mrs. Harvey. Officer Tom Hatcher, Officer Floyd Dillons. - Mr. Dillions. - I suppose you might as well start right at the beginning and work ourselves up to what we've accomplished so far. Boys where's the note? - [Officer] Oh I've got it here. - [Ted] This is the ransom note. There weren't any fingerprints and we haven't heard anything from handwriting yet. - [Payton] How was it delivered? - [Ted] Well Doctor would you mind going over it one more time please? - [Dr. Chapman] Yes I got a call at my office supposedly from Cindy's school that she had been in some sort of accident. They asked if I could come right over to the nurse's office. When I went to the parking lot to get in my car I found this at the end of the visor. - [Payton] I see. And have they called you? - [Dr. Chapman] No. - [Payton] Has there been any attempt to get ahold of you at all since you've gotten the note? - [Dr. Chapman] No we've had a little trouble getting the call. - The note, the note! - Benji, what are you doing Benji? - Stop that dog. (yelling) - Benji! (yelling) Benji! Benji, wait! - Got you. Do you realize how much trouble you could've caused us if you'd have gotten away with this? - He'd have been gone too if you hadn't been here. - Mary what's the deal with this dog? Does he belong around here? - No not really. - Do you want us to call the pound? - I have half a mind to say yes but I don't think I will. Just leave him alone. - You're sure? - Yeah. - Okay, all right, come on Floyd, okay. - [Floyd] I can't understand why he'd take it like that and run off. - What's wrong with you? You act like you've gone crazy. Look I don't like to be mean to you Benji but I'm gonna have to if you cause any more problems. Now go on home, well wherever you go. (dramatic music) - Hey Tuttle, have you heard about the Chapman kid? - Yeah that's really a bad scene. - Yeah, are you working on it? - No the lieutenant's handling it himself and he's got Floyd and Tom working on it. - [Man] Why Chapman? How much could they expect to get from him? - [Tuttle] I don't know. - [Woman] Yeah. - [Woman] Old man Benson's really been on a tear. - [Woman] Tell me about it. This is the third day in a row we've had to work late. - Hey come back here. - Oh leave him alone, maybe he'll hide in Benson's office and bite him in the morning. (laughing) - Will Benson be in in the morning? - Yeah I hope so. Go ahead I'll get it locked up. - [Tuttle] All right. (barking) (dramatic music) (energetic music) (barking) (energetic music) (barking) (barking through speaker) - What the devil are you doing in there? (energetic music) - [Mitch] Will you sit those kids down? - They're restless, they need to move around. - [Mitch] Well move them around some place else. That pacing back and forth is about to drive me crazy. - Would you kids like to go upstairs? You're not afraid of me now? - [Paul] I don't think so. - But we're afraid of this house. - Well there's no need to be afraid of it. - Uh huh. There's some old lady's head in here. - I told you Henry. - Shut up. Both of you shut up. All of you just shut up! You know, I have got you people in the middle of a $100,000 split and all I hear is moaning about being involved in, and talk about some fool head floating around. Well I want to tell you I'm sick of it. I am sick of it. Do you understand? So will you all just can it? - [Riley] I understand that's how it all started. - [Mitch] What? - With the head. Mr. Powell tried to can it. - You be funny on somebody else's time or that head's gonna have company. What's that? - It's a dog. - Benji! - It's the kid's dog. - Hey he's got the ransom note. - What do you mean he's got the ransom note? How can he have the ransom note? - It was a sloppy try, it was the first one. I threw it away. - Come on dog, come on give me the note. Come on, come on. Come on dog. Come on give me the note, give me the, I got you. (barking) Ow, what the, what was that? - Where'd that one come from? - Why you little mutt it'll be a cold day before you bite anyone else. (dog yelping) (thudding) (dramatic music) Well don't just stand there, go get the other dog! (energetic music) - [Henry] There he is! (energetic music) Get out of the way. - It's stuck. (groaning) - Ah come on. (energetic music) - He jumped down from out there. - Let's go downstairs. (energetic music) - Where'd he go? - How should I know? There he is, get it. (panting) - You don't think he knows what he's doing do you? - No, but I'm not gonna give him a chance to prove me wrong. Come on. (dramatic music) - I just wanted to come by and see if there was anything I could do. Oh look. - There he is, that dog again. - Isn't he cute? - [Man] Is that the note, the ransom note? - Come here little doggy. - [Dr. Chapman] Mary will you please get that dog out of here? - Come on. - [Mary] Benji come here. - Let me see what you've got there. (barking) - Benji what is the matter with you? Stop that this minute do you hear me? I'm ashamed of you. Now be still. - [Linda] Somebody's old grocery list. - Benji hush. (barking) - Well I have to be going. - Well I'll show you to the door. - Thank you for coming Linda Sue and I'm sorry about this dog. - Don't worry about it. - It was nice of you to come over. We all appreciate it. - Well I wanted to. (barking) I wasn't even sure whether you'd remember me but I still wanted to. (barking) - Of course I remember you. A few years wouldn't remove a pretty face like yours. - Stop it. (barking) - Thank you. (barking) Well again if there's anything that we can do just let us know. There's always someone around the house. - [Mary] tell your mother and dad hello Linda Sue. - [Linda] I'll do that, they send their love. (barking) (yelling) - What's the matter Mary? - He bit me. - [Dr. Chapman] Hold it. (suspenseful music) - Come back here dog, come back here! - Benji! - Give that to me. - What is wrong with you? - Please, that's mine, give it to me. - Or I should say, what's wrong with us. - Please, oh please. - Dr. Chapman. - No! - Lieutenant Samuels. - No please, no! - Look at this. - No, no! - It's another ransom note. Payton are you sure you've got the original? - Right here. (chattering) - Where's Paul and Cindy? - I don't know. (barking) (crying) (suspenseful music) (energetic music) - Guys slow down. (barking) - Somebody get a hold of him. (energetic music) - Benji! - Should've done like I said and been out of here an hour ago. I say we don't wait any longer. - We're gonna give her 10 more minutes so sit down and shut up. - In 10 minutes it's sure gonna be dark in here. (energetic music) - [Ted] Don't let that dog get away. (shouting) (energetic music) - Didn't work Mitch. She's not coming. We better find a safer place, now. - I'm for that. - Sit down! We stay. (energetic music) - [Mary] Benji! (shouting) - Don't let him get away. Tom get him on the walkie talkie, tell him where we are. He'll know where a cage is. (shouting) Keep up with him. - [Mary] Benji! - Forget it, we're gonna leave right now. You better use your gun or come with us. - All right we'll go but we're not going half cocked, we're gonna plan it out. (energetic music) Are you sure? - Positive. And there won't be anybody there this time of year. - Pack 'em up. (energetic music) - [Ted] Stay with him, don't let him get away. - [Man] Wait a minute. (energetic music) - Don't move a muscle. Now let 'em down nice and easy. Right over here. Move. - Here I'll get these for you. Are you kids okay? - Mm-hm. - Did he hurt you? - [Ted] All right hands on your head. Both of 'em, move. - Well we'll take care of them where they won't bother you again. - [Dr. Chapman] Cindy, Paul. - Daddy. - Daddy. (laughing) - Are you all right? Everything's all right now. How are you? (laughing) Benji found you. - Oh thank you. - [Dr. Chapman] All right out you go. - You should've seen her Daddy, she was really brave. - So was Benji. - We owe them both a lot, no doubt about it. - [Cindy] Would you say they're kind of like heroes? - I'd say they were definitely heroes. - You left the light on. - Oh. - Well if we owe a lot and they're heroes it wouldn't be right to send them out in the streets would it? - Especially when one's a wounded hero. - I don't know, what about that Mary? Have you known of any heroes being turned onto the street. - Not too many. - Then can they go home with us? - Please Daddy just 'til Tiffany gets well. - No I'm afraid you'd grow to attached to them by then. I think we better plan on them staying for good. Unless of course they get tired of us. - Oh thank you Daddy. - Oh boy. Thank you Daddy. - Thank you Daddy so much. - [Dr. Chapman] All right, all right let's go. - [Cindy] Did you hear that Benji? Come on we're going home. - [Paul] Do we have to build any fences? - [Dr. Chapman] No, no, no fences. - [Paul] What about all those germs and diseases and stuff? - [Dr. Chapman] Oh well let's just say Daddy's values got shifted around a bit. - [Cindy] Do you understand that Paul? - [Paul] I think it means he made a mistake. (laughing) - [Mary] I have a feeling Benji will be sticking pretty close to home now at least until Tiffany can travel better. - [Cindy] By then we can love him so much he'll want to stay. - [Dr. Chapman] I can't think of anyone more qualified to do that then you two. - [Mary] See Benji, I told you he was a nice man. A little selfish sometimes but never as bad as a rotten heel.
