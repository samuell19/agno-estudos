'Makal' 'Daughter' - Listen. - Yeah. I don't think we can trust America anymore! What happened? They don't have a consistent stand. Look what happened in Afghanistan? They orphaned and left them suddenly, right? Many people lost their financial stability because of that. Look at my plight! I lost a lot of my share value in the stock exchange. It's not childish anymore! That's why I said, leave aside all these shares and focus on Gold. Gold is risky. You need to be a little courageous on our profession. I am brave enough. But I am unable to recover properly from an occasional blip. - Just turn around then. - Alas, Oh my God! What happened? Why did you ask me to turn around? I was asking you to shift from Gold to digital. Goodness! I got scared. Didn't you see that police jeep pass by? Why don't you calmly give me advises? So, what I was saying is, Everything is digital now. 'Work from home'. 'Work from home' is risky for us. Everyone is awake during midnight. All of them are online. They then sleep during the day. - It's useless for us. - That's true. That's why I pick uninhabited homes for robbery. But it's thrilling for me to rob a habited house. You are an adventurous guy. There's no adventure here. Just an innocent mother and her school girl. Her husband is working in the gulf and hence no risk. - You're going that side, right? - Yes. I am going this side. An American has gone for a vacation there. There's no dog there. So, it's safe. - See you tomorrow after work then. - Alright. Do well. All the best. [Phone rings] Shit! My dear Shoshamma, haven't I asked you not to call me during duty time? Listen, it's our uncle's daughter- Chinchumol's birthday today. Did you wish? Won't tomorrow morning do? No, it's significant to wish at midnight itself. Please leave a WhatsApp voice message. Alright. Our property deed is with him. Don't forget that. Alright, please cut the call. Uncle... Birthday wishes to Chinchumol on mine and Shoshamma's behalf. Kisses. Kisses are for Chinchumol. Uncle can give it to her when you get time. Mom. Mom. Yeah. I may have heard some noise. Keep quiet and sleep. We should have returned our gold to the bank locker. It's at a safer place here, than the locker. Which is that safer place? There's a container of rice in the store room near our kitchen below, right? Yeah. I have immersed everything inside it. Nobody in the world can possibly discover that. Mom, you're so smart. Go to sleep then. Goodness! Oh, my God! [screams in pain] Yes dear. Is it? Oh, I see. I am on a ride to the airport. I shall drop them and reach there soon. You just inform Bobby sir too. I have informed Bobby uncle. Yeah, he will reach soon. Alright. Why do you need to gather people around? I made a mistake, and I am sorry. Oh my God, this burns. If you release me, I will leave instantly. I won't be in this area after that. Sister, can't you forgive me? You can! I will forgive you. Let everyone reach here first. Let them come. I am in no rush. I shall wait here. You're still using this hand grinder, is it? It's good because it gives the food a special flavor. Hand grinders are available in Amazon now. There are plenty of 'offers' too. I was going to order one for my wife. But she needed a mixer grinder instead. I somehow got one last week. You get all these stuffs without spending anything. Sister, I am a family man, right? But both of you bluffed me so smooth. Sister, please don't create a scene. I am an innocent guy. - Where? - In the work area. Didn't you inform the police? I thought I will inform them after Bobbychayan reaches here. No need of police sir. We can sort this out like gentlemen. You're right. Police isn't necessary. I am enough for you. You will rob the house where there are no men, is it? [screams in pain] Sister, please call the police. Police is better than this. I will beat the bones out of you. Hand me the sanitizer. Move aside dear. - Bobby sir reached? - Yeah. - So, he's the guy? - Yeah. [Hindi] - Where did you come from? - From there. He's a Malayali. Oh, I see. Where are you from? Moolankuzhi. - Where in Moolankuzhi? - Behind the prawn factory. Behind the prawn factory? What's your house name? - Chembarathi... - Chembarathi? "Chembarathingal" How are you related to Anthony chettan of Chembarathingal? I am his son. - What's your name? - Solomon, my church name is Shalomon. - Incredible name you have. - Do you know him? I know his father. He was working in the harbor. How did that poor soul possess such a wicked son? So pathetic! - It's my social situation uncle. - What? Social situations. - I am going to kill you today. - Bobbychaya, let us call the police Social situations it seems! Anyway, nothing harmful happened, right? I will take care of him. Don't take the risk. He's going to be a headache. - Let me try. Walk. - Get moving. Uncle, I didn't take my tool kit. - What? - My toolkit. Sir, can you please take that bag? Take it. God bless you sister, you are bold. - You too. - Get moving. Compliments it seems! - Please drop me at the nearby bus stop. - You're not going anywhere. If I ask you to come and stay at my house, you won't listen. 'An adventurous mother and her daughter.' Please don't say about this to Mom now. If I tell her this, she won't let you stay here alone. - Shall I make tea for you? - Now? No need. Appu, you have the mock test for the entrance exam next week. - Are you studying? - Yeah, somewhat. The exams in our coaching center are not like the one in your schools. It's going to be so precise and definite. I prepared the questions myself. Uncle, why don't you give me the question paper then? Let me just flaunt. If you come unprepared, I will roast you badly, understood? I shall leave then. Lock the doors properly. Don't call me at midnight again! Appu. Wake up. - Wake up Appu. - Yeah. - Betty Aunty is here. - Yeah fine. She has brought a gift for you. - What gift? - Go and see! Wow, so cute. - Do you like it? - Yeah. When the next thief comes, he will warn you. Thank you, aunty. What's its name? You only name him. - Cookie. - Nice name. I am leaving then. I have got a meeting. Had your breakfast? I don't have time dear. The workload is huge. - Just wait for ten minutes. - No, I am running out of time. I am envious of you sitting jobless at home. Let's go. Is this what I taught you? Ma'am, we have modified it a bit according to the situation. I didn't choreograph this dance for you to change it according to your wish. Who made the changes? Who did this? It was Aparna who suggested to make these changes. She said that you will like it. Are you more experienced than me? To design all the programs for the youth festival, including this, the principal has assigned me. So, you better follow what I teach. Start the music. Saw that? You have to do like this. Eyes and face should possess expressions, understood? Sorry ma'am, my face won't possess such expressions. - Aparna, what's this? - Appu, wait. Why are you early today? Hello, cool down man. Your period dates for this month have approached, isn't it? Yeah. That's the reason for these sudden bursts of irritation. If you didn't like teacher's choreography, you don't follow it. But when you overreacted and walked out, didn't your friends suffer? Why don't you understand that? You should have some tolerance. Sorry Mom. That's okay. Patch it up tomorrow. - That's how it is usually, right? - Yeah. Take a bath. Let's go for a drive to the grandma's place. Is bathing necessary? I won't let you enter my car without bathing. [Friendly chatter] We are lucky that the thief was a fool. Otherwise, your 'Home alone' adventure would have flopped big time. Haven't I asked you to come and stay here in the night at least? Don't you know that Nandettan doesn't like it? And if I wish to come and stay there, Bobby doesn't like it. So, the problem is solved. Nobody needs to shift anywhere. If it were a flat, at least the apartment security would have been there. 90 percent of the people here still live in homes on the ground. That security is enough for us too. That's not what I meant. Either your husband should come and stay with you here, Or he should take his family to Dubai and settle there. Your 'workshop mechanic' husband however can't possibly afford it. Bobby! I just expressed my concern when I see her struggle like this. We don't have any struggles Bobbychaya. The workshop mechanic is struggling enough in Dubai so as not to make us struggle. We're very happy. The brother- sister fighting has begun, has it? Brothers all over the world express their love by irritating their sisters. - You also reiterate the same way. - Correct. Julie, please stay longer. I just got a call from the hospital. Two of my patients were directed to the labor room, before I came here. Get them delivered fast and come back. - Will you be late today? - I will check and call. Okay. It's a good thing that you brought the bag. People still get furious if we don't pack it in plastic bags. Hello Nandetta. Just give me a minute. Please take this brother. Hello. What? I can't hear you Nandetta. Can you call me after five minutes? What happened? - My daughter was here. - Okay. Appu! What's this? I moved the car a bit for the auto to pass through. Move aside! Won't you get the license in a year? Can't you wait till then? Hi Nandetta... I was in the market. I couldn't hear anything. Is it? Alright Nandetta. Will you call tonight? Okay. What's the matter Mom? - Your Dad is coming. - Nice. Cookie. Why aren't you happy about Dad's arrival? Who said that? I am happy. He lost his job. - He won't go back again. - Oh my God! - Why are you worried about that? - Nothing. We must keep a check on our expenses. You should be more careful Appu. Will my pocket money be scrapped too? Perhaps. What happened? A few of my friends' fathers behave like 'Hitler'. Will my Dad also end up like them? I have no clue. You better be nice to him. It's a little strain to mollycoddle one more person. Is it? Will he be a 'thorn' in our freedom? [Both laugh] Close the door. [Entrance Coaching Class] What will be the mass of an electron? Aparna? [Aparna answers] [Class continues] It will come around... Good morning, Sir. The rules and manners here aren't applicable to you, is it? Was it deliberate not to ask permission before entering the class? - When I came, you were a little busy. - Pardon? When I came, you were a little busy. So, I thought it's better not to disturb you. It's been half an hour since the class has begun. Actually, I was ready for the class much earlier. But my bike had a starting problem. So, my Dad offered me to drop me here, on his way to the court. But my Dad got late. Naturally, I also got late. [Everyone laughs] These excuses won't be valid when your entrance results come out. Also, this is your third attempt. Don't forget that. [Class continues] - Got it? - Yes Sir. - All of you? - Yes Sir. Okay. So, we will go for the next. Oops! - You only clean the board then. - Me? - Don't you know how to clean it? - Yeah. Okay I will. - Sir, I have cleaned it up. - Okay. Where are you going? Stay right here. Attend the class from here. You will be more focused then. Okay? Now, let's solve another problem. To find out the kinetic energy of an ejected electron, okay? Got it? Then, what does 'h' stand for? What does 'h' stand for? Is it 'height'? Height? Go and sit there. No, it's okay. From here, I can focus better. That's enough. Go and sit. Once your Dad comes back, your lonely adventures will end. How was he in his childhood? Was he innocent? Innocent? I used to beat him up regularly. Was he that naughty? He wasn't naughty. He was stubborn. If he wanted something, he needed it then and there. But he was very lazy in his studies. He had the consideration of being a teacher's kid in the school. He would just exploit that. He just about cleared his tenth standard. That's why we directed him to a vehicle workshop. But he was smart enough to win my Mom's heart over. His humor sense is incredible. That's how your Mom fell for him. Eat it up fast and give this to your grandfather. If we wait for his consultation to end, he may not have this coffee at all. Extend your tongue. Lift your hand. - Come on. Lift a little more. - It's a little difficult doctor. - You should control your diet. - Yeah. Haven't you heard learned people say.... "You may eat everything that you desire for... But that doesn't mean, you may eat the whole of it". Doctor, the diet is really controlled now. How come your body is like this then? - Have your medicines on time, okay? - Okay. - Should I button it for you? - No Doctor. It looks like you got busier after your retirement. A few of my familiar patients still visit me for consultation. It's not possible to reject them. Were there entrance, NEET exams during your time too? No, all the admissions those days were purely based on merit. Even though I had the marks to join MBBS, I took up Ayurveda. I am fed up with these classes and coaching. To be honest, I don't want to become either a doctor or a collector. But Bobby uncle is so persuasive. He wants me to achieve all the degrees, that my mother couldn't possibly get. Doctor. Greetings! Look who's here. Why are you alone? To visit you, I don't need anyone to accompany me anymore. That stage is long gone. All thanks to you. - Who's this? - She is my grandchild. Listen dear. Your grandfather is a genius. My children took me to a lot of prestigious hospitals and doctors. Not one of them could cure my illness. But he cured it. He's such a legend. You're able to sleep well, right? Of course, I have no issues now. I can manage all the home chores too. That means, I am completely fine now. I wanted to thank you in person. That's why I came here. See, this is the best compliment a doctor can ever get. - I am not wasting your time anymore. - Alright. For being kind to helpless souls like us, may God bless you abundantly. Alright. Also, if you can make calls to my home occasionally and seek about me, I will be happy. You can call me too. Doctor might be busy, right? I don't want to disturb you. If it's inconvenient for you, then it's fine. There's no inconvenience. Please note down my number. Dear, please note down the number. There's country code and all, is it? 222...222... What did you just say? - 222...222... - Okay. You write it down. 22....22... 00...00... 555...555... 99...99... 52527...72721... Mom is here. Come. - Mom, please come with us. - I don't want to come. Sorry doctor, we have been searching for her for a long time. [Randomly rambling the phone number] Mom, please stay silent and get into the car. Let me finish saying the number. - Genius! - Shut up. Is Dad going to sleep in this room? Not him. You're going to sleep here. Me? Why should I sleep here? Why can't we all sleep together in a single room? Just ask your friends, Whether they are all still sleeping with their parents or not. Such a fool. - Are you asleep Mom? - Yeah, I am asleep. Why's Dad coming now? What's your problem? I just need my Mom. The problem is that her friends are with her all the time. If I propose her now, will they tease me? For sure, they will tease you. This guy has amazing dedication. He is still checking you out. The guy standing next to him looks good. Yeah, he has nice hair. - Oh shit! Are they still looking at me? - Yes. - Is it? - Yes. Every one of them needs just me. - The one stalking you is an idiot, right? - Yeah. Yes Mom... Reached? When? Yeah, I am coming. So, I am going, bye. Please pay mine too. - Bye. - Bye. Didn't I tell you? She can't resist when she sees me. - You please move away. - What? - We need some privacy. Please. - Okay. Dear... I don't know how to begin. Aparna, don't leave. I haven't begun yet. - Hey... - Yeah? - What happened? - She said that we'll meet in the evening. Okay. What's this Appu? I was expecting Dad to open the door. Why are you late? Dad was waiting for you till now. He wanted to surprise you when you come from school. Only when you started getting late, I called you. Where's he then? He just got out now. He might be there at Lorens Uncle's house. Break it into smaller logs. Only then, we can use them in the cooking stove. Ok uncle. - Hi honey. - Hi darling. Hi... Haven't you finished this yet? You must clean the water tank after this. I will do that for some time then. I am bored of this. That's fine. You finish this first. Let him finish this first. Tank is here only. It's up to you. You need to pluck a few coconuts from the coconut tree on the backyard. Before you do that, clean my car as well. Finish this first. You haven't let him go yet? He is my "genie" now. He does all kinds of work. Otherwise, he is going to the jail. Also, gas cylinders are expensive now. Did my Dad come here? He came here. But we couldn't talk much. Madhavan Kutti Menon came and took him along. - He will be there. - Alright. You have got better at this. Damn. Dad. Appu. Oh goodness. Have you come from Dubai to repair this vehicle? Menon Sir was a regular client in my old workshop. It seems, this vehicle has been out of order for five months now. Have you come in search of your Dad? Have this. - Shall I take juice for you too? - No thank you. - She will have this. - No, you have it. - Have it. - I don't need it. - Sir, please start the vehicle. - Okay. Hold this. Is it okay now? I knew you could easily repair this. An outside mechanic will prove to be expensive, right? - Shall I push off? - Alright. Come. You didn't take bath today, right? [Both laugh] Oh my God! It looks like the whole of Kerala is on the table. That's because this is the first day. Don't expect this every day. What happened? No nothing, I just got reminded of my 'Khuboos'. If you are that sad about Khuboos, we can get that from our nearby supermarket. From tomorrow, we can make Khuboos and curd to be our dinner. I fondly remember the delicacy of your cooking and somehow eat that Khuboos there. What's this? You should not drink water along with the food. It badly affects our diet. Either one hour before, or one hour later. We should have liquid only like that. There should be discipline in everything we do. - But Dad... - Yes... How about those having soup and starch water? Won't they have this liquid problem? That's soup and starch water. This is rice. That's the difference. Do you understand now? Yeah, I understood. Do you understand, Mom? I understood. How many grains of rice have you wasted here? It's said that every grain has the name of the person eating it engraved on it. You should respect the food. Sorry Dad, I will be more careful from hereon. Okay. P G Nandakumar - this grain has your name engraved on it. Brilliant! Do you have tissue Julie? You can forget the tissue and Khuboos now. There's a little one roaming around here. Let her comprehend the love her Dad has for her mother. There are a lot of mosquitoes here. There isn't any in Dubai. All the mosquitoes in Dubai have landed here, right? It's very peaceful to sit here. Have a little sweet too then. Pudding it is. Appu has a great sense of humor. It shows a healthy mind. Healthy mind is questionable. At times for her tantrums, I really wish to slap her. It's difficult to handle a teenager alone. To manage her, you need to be her best friend. If you behave like a 'headmaster' instead, kids will turn rebels. You managed it well till now. I wasn't lucky enough to witness her mischief or any other happy moments. She will provide you a lot of such moments. There's a lot of time for that. Since you have decided to settle down here, what's the plan? We have to find an earning, right? Don't worry about that. We have lived honorably so far, right? It will be like that in the future too. The practical experience and the professionalism that I have achieved from abroad, will be put into use precisely. I have planned some projects too before boarding the flight. We will think about that later. For the last 10 -15 years, there's a life that we were unable to have... We're going to start that now. - Are you scared to sleep alone? - Yeah. Come. Here's your bright and brilliant girl. Sleep. We can start the life tomorrow. - Do you have pain here? - A little. - How about here? - A little. Sit straight then. - Does he eat well? - He doesn't eat much doctor. Leave it alone Nanda. It's almost 5 to 8 years old. Your Dad has decided to buy a new one. Only expats had this habit of disposing the things that got damaged, and buy new ones instead. If you give it for repair, it will cost more than a new one. The mechanic is here now. Let me try. Okay. I have changed the medicines a bit. Have them on time. Okay. Always remain positive and keep your spirits high. Okay doctor. - Wow, this is working now, is it? - Yeah. So, this will live for some more time. Like me. You're in top condition Dad. A lot of patients and lots of money. I have enough money. But both of us have planned a world tour with it. Oh, I see. You've such plans in your old age, is it? Yeah, there is a plan like that. There are parents who force their kids to take care of them in their old age. We don't belong to that type. We need neither your money, nor your protection. Kids should take care of their affairs. Please don't disturb us. How's that possible? It's a father's duty to take care of his kids. Just because you have turned old, there's no relaxation to that. Oh, I see. Since you've decided not to relax one bit, I can relax a bit. No problem, you may relax. Are you free today? From now on, I am fully free. I got a call from Madhavan Namboothiri. He's sick. - Let's go there. - Okay. What's your actual plan now? I would like to start a business. Is it a workshop? Like before? No, that's not ideal anymore. I would like to start a unit of organic curry powder. Let's see. I do the world tour through the 'safari' channel already. I can also raise some money. You're my strength Dad. I don't need money Dad. You just be with me always, healthy and energetic. You don't need tobacco, right? What's the point without tobacco? To have the full effect of chewing betel leaves, tobacco is essential. Okay. Please take this inside. If the doctor sees this, then we will be in trouble. Go inside. Make it fast. You said that you aren't well. You seem to be fine. Only if I say I am sick, you will come here. You seem to have not lost the art of bluffing people. I wanted to see you. Also, I have a few inconveniences too. Weren't you in Dubai? I came back. From now on, I will be here only. That's good. You can support your Dad too. What's your problem now? I have indigestion issues. Also, appetite is less. Urine is slightly yellowish too. - Let me see. - Okay. Okay. - Nanda... - Yes. In the northern part of the compound, there will be 'gale of the wind' plant. Pluck 'Punarnava' too. Is 'Punarnava' necessary? 'Gale of the wind' doesn't allow that or what? [Nandan laughs]. The main problem is not that now. Then what's the problem? - My grandkids had come from Calcutta. - Okay. When they were playing, - I took the bat and gave a few hits. - Okay. On my third attempt, I felt something in the back. It's very painful and I can't even move it. - There's no shortage of mischief then. - [Namboothiri laughs]. Just stand up. - [Namboothiri groans in pain]. - Like that. Isn't this a mechanical injury? This 'mechanic' is enough for this. Nanda...Please check. Can he do it? - He was with me for a long time. - Okay. - Sir? - Yeah. - You said the pain is here, right? - Yeah. - Stay like that. - Okay. Oh my God! - How's it now? - I am fine now. - Is it? - Yeah. The 'mechanic' is good. [Everyone laughs] - This mill was in great working condition. - Okay. The competition was huge and we couldn't keep up. So, I had to give up. The machines are still in working condition, right? Of course, when the demand was high, the machines were running 24 hours. There is no problem at all. Full guarantee in that. I don't come here often. Ramankutty presided over the entire unit. He has two saw mills too. He devotes his entire attention there. That's how we had to close this. But because of that, I suffered. I had been working here for 30 years. I won't get sleep if I don't get the smell of coriander powder and chili powder here. Ramankutty is also in great working condition. If you are buying this, take him along too, for free. Come. The packing machines are on the other side. I will show you. It's been only 5 years since we had installed this. - Okay. - We maintain it well too. Alright. Listen, did you come from Dubai to run this powder mill? My uber is better than this. Lorens, it's not going to be like what you see here. Once we take it up, things will change. It will be a lot more pleasant. In my mind, the machines here are up and running already.

Happy birthday to you, Happy birthday to you, Happy birthday to you, Happy birthday dear Ammachi, Happy birthday to you. [chatter] Tomorrow's duty should be covered properly. Yes Sir. The full strength should be assembled on time. Yes Sir. If there's anything else, I should be informed. Yes Sir. Can you come soon? It's time to give this gift to Ammachi. - You carry on. - Yes sir. A gift to Ammachi, from our side. Italian massage chair. Wow great. You don't need to exercise daily anymore. Just sit on this chair for fifteen minutes. It gives full body massage. You knee problems will vanish soon. This is our gift to Ammachi. Isn't it time to change your specs? From now onwards, use this. When I was studying in Maharaja's college, I had a friend there. Every Sunday, he used to wake up early, take bath and get ready. Then he finds the auditoriums in Ernakulam, where grand weddings were held. He would have the sumptuous meal there, blesses the couple, and even hands them a gift before leaving the hall. Only when they open the gift in the evening, they would realize the truth. It might be some frivolous stuffs. [Everyone laughs] When I gave the gift, you remembered this story, right? I remember him whenever I see someone gifting something. Okay. I think he's now in Canada or USA or something. Let's have dinner then. Yes, for sure. Come Nandan. Come Ammachi. Ammachi may sit here. - Aren't you having dinner? - Yeah, one second. - You also sit. - Yeah, I will sit. Give me a plate. Hello. The phone was in silent mode. I didn't realize it. When? Oh my God. We will be there soon. What happened? Lorens's wife got burnt in the kitchen. Oh my God. Come, let's go. They will manage it. Have your dinner and leave. We will eat later. Come Appu. All of you have your dinner. I am sorry. Poor soul. She burnt Lorens's wife for nothing. He remembered his old 'fraud' friend when he saw my gift. If I had stayed there longer, I would have to hear more of his boasting. It's not like we were desperate for the food there. Your Mom is very smart. Even though Bobby says all those, he is a good person. Since the smartness in her reacted like this, I lost a nice Christian feast. This is fresher than that. Also, it tastes great too. Exactly. As usual, mother- daughter is one team now and I am out. Excuse me, where can I find the 'Pravasi' masala powder? Sir, the masala powders are in that section. There? I need that specific brand. Pravasi masala. It's very good. - Let me check then. - Okay. The listed stock should be lined up in front. Excuse me, where can I find the 'Pravasi' masala powder? Pravasi? It's new to the market. I have used it and felt it to be original. So, I prefer that. Sir, here it is. Oh yes. This is it. Oh this? First time, I am hearing good things about this. Sir, you should buy this and use it in your home. Pravasi masala powder is the best among the lot. - Oh, is it? - Thank you. Okay. Where's the manager? - He's there. - Okay. Sorry, I wasn't careful enough. You should be careful then. Okay, sorry. Bloody stranger. - Good morning. - Good morning. I had kept some of my products here last month. I would like to get the payment for the same. What is your product? Sir, you haven't recognized me yet. I am Nandan - Pravasi curry powder's... Yeah, alright. In the last one month, one piece got sold, that too today. That's not possible. We are receiving great feedbacks. But people need to buy them first. You should give good publicity. The competition is very strong. All the other products are adulterated. Sawdust in Coriander powder. Brick powder in Chili powder. My product is entirely organic. But we don't necessarily need organic products. You may add sawdust, brick powder or any adulterant you wish. But people should buy it. We can't make the payment without selling them. Here you go. My marketing proof for the day. Also, I present it nicely to the passengers boarding my car. How's that? I begin with the normal pleasantries. Gradually, I will land the discussion on Pravasi curry powder. Lorens, it's a humongous market. Your small techniques won't be enough there. Don't discourage me man. Let me do my bit. It won't matter much. Please have it. It's not fair that Nandan is having this orange juice. Especially when we sit for a drink. There is some exquisite wine. Shall I take it? - No, this will do. - Okay. The manager in the supermarket says that we should give good publicity. If someone whom the public trusts well, explains about our product, I think that will work. Exactly, like celebrities, film actors... I don't have the budget to do publicity with the film people. Isn't Sreenivasan, the film actor, a staunch supporter of organic food? Right, why don't we try that? That's a possibility. Besides, when he had come for Pravasi association program in Ajman before, I was the one who welcomed him then. He might not have forgotten that. Good morning sir. Good morning. I am Nandan. Nandakumar. I was working in the gulf. Do you recognize me? 10 years ago, you had come for a function in Ajman. I was the one who welcomed you. Do you remember me now? Oh, how can I forget a person who welcomed me in some function, 10 years ago? I was thinking about you today morning too, at 9:30 a.m. I mean, I have left gulf for good. I have started a business here- of the organic curry powder. Aren't you an ambassador of that? I don't endorse anything. I just wish that people get to eat unadulterated food. That's my intention too. Take a look at this. It's 100 percent organic. If you have any doubts, you can take this to the laboratory in NASA and get it tested. - Where? - NASA laboratory in America. Nandan, do one thing then... Take these powders to the NASA, get them tested and bring back the results. Sir, I meant...It's very authentic. Pravasi- apt name for masala powder. Isn't it better than the 'Dakshayani' biscuit in the film Midhunam, Sir? Yeah. I was very active in the Pravasi association. Hence, many people address me 'Pravasi Nandan' too. That's also a reason for giving that name. Nice. I am keeping all these here. Please request your wife to use them and give me feedback when I come again. - No need of all these. - Let it be there. I am not wasting your time anymore. - You may resume the writing. - Okay. - Did you click this picture? - Yeah. From what you've said, this smile is special. Yeah, it's special, right? Even I thought so. But considering the exaggeration you normally possess, This is a normal smile. Girls have a natural ability to pose candidly in photos. No. With the help of my associates, I spied on her group. And? Apparently, she has once said, "Rohit is very funny." - Really? - Yeah. Despite that, if she has removed me from Instagram, it says a lot. It just meant one thing- 'cut' Give it to me. Enough. I don't need a sister's support in this. We will elope. Elope it seems. You will be out of this house then. That will be alright, when we have kids. [Both laugh] May your Dad also know the joke? Has the legal age for marriage been reduced now Dad? For whom? You or him? She has found someone Dad. She's saying that she will elope with him. The restlessness to answer quickly is proof enough. You're the culprit. That's it. First you clear your entrance exam. If she starts being a little soft to me, I will latch on to it. She knows it well. That's why she's still staying 'out of coverage'. Come on... Pass pass pass... Pass the ball. [chatter] Pass the ball. Hi, can you come a little forward? I am not a moron. What? I mean, I am not a moron. My Dad is a busy advocate in the High court. Even though Mom is a homemaker, she has completed B.Ed. I have one elder sister. She will be a doctor in two years. Why are you saying all these to me? I was just describing my family details. Since I am from such a family, even if I try, I can never be a moron. I swear, it's a fact. Sister, can you please move a little? Sister, you too. Aparna, please don't move. Since your uncle is there in the coaching centre, I can't talk to you from there. Since I have completed my plus- 2 three years back, school isn't safe either. I can get caught anytime. Besides, these people will believe that I am an ogler. However hard I try, I can never be that. - Hey. - Yeah. Are you studying in this school? I told you know. They caught me. No Sir, I was around. So I just got in. - Get going then. - Okay. All the girls come down. Girls, go fast. Speed up. Aparna, can you add me in Instagram? I will think about it. Okay, that will do. - Get out. - Yeah, I am leaving. Just remove the grass. Don't disturb the stems of the Chinese potato. Okay. Good morning sir. Got into the garden so early in the morning? I was planning to call you. You don't need to test them in NASA laboratories. The turmeric powder, chili powder every one of them is top class. It had a homemade feeling. Even my wife, Vimala, liked it so much. It's God's blessing to receive such a comment from you. Don't credit God for that. It's the result of your sincerity. Completely unadulterated masala powder. That's what I felt. Sir, can you repeat this on the phone camera? My wife and factory workers will be so delighted. - Is that necessary? - Please sir. We, Malayalis, have been eating poison, instead of food for years. Mostly, they import this poison from Andra, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu and force feed us. The significance of Nandan's Pravasi Masala powder lies there. I am saying this only after using it and is completely convinced about its quality. I wish that the Pravasi workers can retain the same honesty in their business. Great, this is the advertisement we need. But there's no point if you keep that video on your phone. People should watch it. When someone of Sreenivasan's stature speaks with such sincerity, People may get excited. They will come in search of Pravasi curry powder. That's right. If we do that, there will be an uplift. What should I do now? Leave it to me man. This video should run all over the social media. - Digital marketing is the trend now. - Okay. We need to edit this video and make it 'viral'. I will take care of it. It's an enquiry from a supermarket group in Dubai. They have around 30 outlets. The purchase manager is an old friend of mine. If an outlet can sell 5 pieces a day, 150 pieces will be sold every day. If people start recognizing the quality of our product, the narrative will change. May the narrative change. Let Pravasi Nandan become a big shot industrialist. The guava is good. Did you give it to Appu? I will give it to her. Come then. Cookie. Cookie. Don't bite me. Appu. Have some of these. What's this? Why are you playing with it on the dining table? We eat from here, right? I will remove it by then. It's biting the banana. Take it away. Haven't I told you not to bring it inside the house? Dad, isn't it a living being like us? Like us? It's a puppy. The cage is built outside, especially for it. Yesterday, it was lying on the sofa and its fur was all over the place. Also, a pungent smell. Dear, please take it to the cage outside. And wash your hands and body with soap. Go, make it fast. Yeah, take it and go. Good girl. She is very obedient. Hey. Wait. What's this? Why are you going upstairs? I will take it to my room and play with it. Appu, why are you so stubborn? Take it to the cage. Appu, take it to the cage. Listen to what your Dad says. - Go. - This is sad. Yuck. [Indistinct chatter in a film shooting spot] Hey Sethu. How do you do? What? Advertisement? I haven't acted in any advertisement. No, that was not meant for an advertisement. Let the video go 'viral'. I don't care about that. Sethu, do one thing... Forward that to my WhatsApp number After the 'Sreenivasan' video, there is a definite upsurge. Let there be further upsurge. - We should increase our production. - Yeah. Oh my God, Sreenivasan sir... Sir, I was just talking about you. Today evening? Oh yes, I am totally free. Alright. [Malayalam Song] "Blossomed are the coral jasmine, long into the blue sky" [Malayalam Song] "The hour of purity when the feathers of love have smiled" He just called to see you. He is not offering you a role in a film, right? You never know. He has just invited me to his home in the evening. Anyway, he has genuinely felt some attachment to me. You know, grand tales of great friendship begin like this. Sreenivasan is the only celebrity from the film industry, whom I wanted to meet in person. Then you also come. Not just you, let Appu also come. He might not like it. You go and meet him. Sreeniavsan is a completely different person to what we see on screen. He is extremely friendly. Get ready. Why are you taking all these plants? Those people interested in organic farming, like getting stuffs like these. - You drive the car. - No need, you only drive. See, that's your Dad's ego. The false pride is due to the fact that my family gifted me this car. Not at all. My Indian license got expired. Besides, if you want to transfer the Dubai license to India, There are a lot of formalities in the RT office. I am just waiting to get some free time to do that. I don't have any ego otherwise. Yeah, you wait and see Appu. Until he buys his own car, he won't renew his license. You drive. - Greetings sir. - Yeah. You may receive a legal notice soon. I called to inform you that. Goodness, what happened sir? Who gave you permission to misuse my personal statement? and use it as an advertisement for the masala powder? Sir, I didn't advertise it. I just shared it among my family and friends' groups. You can say all that in the court. I am going to file a cheating case against you. As per IPC 420, you may receive imprisonment for 3 to 7 years. Add the cyber crimes along with it, you may get another two years. Then you can process your masala powder inside the jail. Sorry Sir, I will delete it now itself. I was not aware of all these. Sorry. - Sir, they are my wife and daughter. - Okay. Both of them like you so much. So, I took them along. - I may delete this now. - Alright. We were friends in Ajman earlier. Hence, I was just pulling his leg. Goodness, I got really scared. Hello Hello. Hello Lorens. The line got disconnected. When I get him on phone, I will delete it within five minutes. There's no need to delete it anymore. Everyone has seen it already. But never compromise on the quality. That will never happen Sir. Pravasi won't produce a single adulterated product. - That's enough. - Okay. Sir, can we have a selfie? - Sure. - Come. Let's take a selfie and have some coffee too before you leave. - These are a few saplings of pepper. - Okay. Is Nandan not a part of this family? Yeah. It will be over soon. - Nothing to worry. - Okay. - It's done. Good. - Okay. - Thank you doctor. - Okay, Welcome. Come dear. - Get in here. - Come dear. Come. You lost your job in Dubai, right? I didn't lose it. I left it. Oh okay. - Is Vaccination done for Cookie? - Your Dad has taken it to the clinic. - Didn't he take the car? - He won't take that car, you know. Sad. Where is Cookie? Here it is. Where did it go? Did you throw it away? What? It was here only. Where did it go then? I had stopped at the junction to give directions for a car. It might have jumped out then. I will bring it back soon. Don't stare at me. I will bring it back for sure. Get changed. It won't be lost. Auto? Auto? Auto? Auto? [Nandan makes noises] [Nandan whistles] Hello, is it Pink Police? Appu, eat something. If you don't eat anything, will you get 'Cookie' back? I was a little careless. I am sorry. It's just a puppy, right? We can buy a better one. If you lose me, will you buy someone else and give to Mom? Are you like a puppy to us? Cookie is as important to me as I am to you. You don't get it. Nonsense. It was an innocent mistake darling. I am sure that he purposefully did it. He used to say that he would throw it away, right? When he got an opportunity, he just did that. Oh God, why did I take it out now for the vaccination? Julie, I just stopped for two minutes to give directions for a car. Who would expect it to jump out by then? Why did you take the scooter? Wasn't there a car here? You won't take it. Ego. It's Mom's property know? Stop it. You have been blabbering for some time now. I am already running around, trying to meet ends. In between that, her obsession for her puppy. I don't like it. Miserable being. I threw it away. - Yeah, just admit it. - Yeah, I agree. Please stop this. I was about to share a happy news. I wanted to make it a surprise, in everyone's presence. That's when both of you are fighting like wild animals. I am not saying it anymore. What's the matter, Julie? If something makes you happy, it should delight me too, right? I got a memorandum from the PSC today, to join for the job. You should have told this first. Where's the posting? Wayanad. In the collectorate. - But I am not going. - Why's that? If you both are fighting like this, even in my presence, how can I possibly go leaving you two here? - That's just a... - I have decided that I am not going. It was my biggest dream to get a government job. It was a proud moment to prove to my family that my choice of life is correct. Probably, I am not destined for that. Julie. Is my silly fight with Appu a reason for you to give up your job? You were humiliated a lot, just because you eloped with a workshop mechanic. This appointment is a last chance in the PSC rank list and it's like a lottery. This is an answer to all those. It's not just that Nandetta. All the while, how many days have we lived together? If not now, when are we going to do it? More than the job, I value the security we have now. I value our small world the most. That's enough for me. That's true. Don't see this job as an extra income. It's the result of your hard work. It's your pride. The only issue is that the job posting is a little far, right? But if you get transferred here, the problem will be solved. Come what may, I won't allow you to let this job slip away. [Bus annoucement] I am rich enough to hire a taxi. It's still not late. Why do you need a taxi when there is only one person travelling? Besides, this is safer. Still, such a long route and you're all alone. Appu has exams, right? As and when I reach there, Xavier uncle and Aunty will be at the bus station. Don't worry about that. If your Dad fights with you, just pick up your phone and leave a voice note to me. Even if I am far, I am still capable of handling your Dad. In the name of the father, the son and holy spirit, Amen. Let's pray. Dear God, the most powerful and benevolent. Bless us with the bountiful life. Dear God, by dissolving the holy spirit within you, The one who rules and lives as the God, Through Jesus, the son of God and our lord, Please accept our prayers that we present before you. Amen. Our father in heaven, hallowed be your name. May your kingdom come... May your will be done, on earth as in heaven. Give us today our daily bread. Forgive us our sins, as we forgive those who sin against us. Lead us not into temptation. Mom, I called you a lot of times. Appu, I can't even breathe properly, forget picking up the phone. There's no office time as such. At times I work till dusk. Weren't you saying that Wayanad is such a serene place? Yeah, 'serene' it seems. I can't even get to see the sky here. Time ticks like the clock that's attached to the time-bomb. We can't relax one bit here, like you normally associate with a government office. Enjoy your dream, Mom. Yeah. Who will drop you home after the prayer? Dad said that he will come and pick me. - He won't eat from there. - Madam. But he won't have any apathy towards Christian food. Ask Grandma to pack some food for your Dad too. Grandma has already planned that. Will you call me at night? Yeah, I will call you. - Juliet... - Yes Sir. Every one of us here has a mobile phone. But we don't use it during the office time. - Sorry sir. - Yeah. Listen. Better be texting on your phone. He will be noticing you, only if you make calls. Hey....Hi... Didn't they understand? With these prayers and other Christian rituals, Will your Mom's family finally baptize you? The deal between you two is to let me decide, once I reach 18 years, isn't it? So let me decide then, whether to be a Hindu or a Christian? That's correct. But from my observation so far, Christian rituals are classy and elegant. Goodness, our rituals are much more beautiful. Once you take bath, apply bindi, light the lamp and stand in front of Guruvayurappan, The peace and happiness that you get, when you pray to him, is indescribable. Oh Lord! What an act of canvassing! For that, you need to bath first. Please make a special tea now. Let me test your skills. There won't be any specialty when someone who doesn't bath makes tea. So, make it yourself. Lazy fellow. I have a lot to study and write. When will I complete all these, Oh my Jesus! - I am sorry Dad. - It's okay. - Dairy milk. - Okay. Have you changed the phone pattern? Why? I want to call a friend. She blocked my number, unknowingly. - Make the call through WhatsApp then. - I am blocked there too. - Instagram? - There too. - Understood. The 'other' girl. - Yeah. Shameless fellow!. Don't go behind someone when you are blocked. - There's no enmity here. - Really? When we were chatting, I unknowingly said 'I love you'. - Unknowingly? 'I Love you'? - Yes. - Tell me the number. - 9895133776. What's this? Say it slower. 98..95..13..37..76 Have this. Come. Come...come... Have it. Hello. Hi Aparna. I am Sangeetha, your huge fanboy - Rohit's sister. Please don't cut the call. I will give the phone to him. I promise that he won't go overboard. - Keep decorum. - Okay. Hello. You're getting the family involved, is it? When you blocked me, I felt so helpless. So, to solve that... Don't waste your time, Rohit. I am a little old school. Old School? Yeah, this is a waste of time. When it's the right time, my parents will consider my tastes and give me a lot of options. Then I will pick the best from them. Pretty simple, right? What if I am better than the best? My parents also should feel that, right? Alright. Today onwards, my efforts to impress them have begun. If you need to impress my Mom, you might have to go Wayanad. My Dad is here. Superficially, he may appear like a soft person. But he is a tough person. We can soften him. I will be that special son in law that any father-in-law will dream to have. Okay Son in law, carry on. I have a little work here. Please don't cut the call. I may not get my sister's phone always. She's a little arrogant. So please, can you unblock me? Let me think about it. Yeah, it's better now. I didn't expect such a fast growth in very little time. Malayalees always recognize the good ones, Sir. - We just have to be a little patient. - Hey Nandan... Do you have Pravasi coriander powder? Hey... - I had communicated to Arun. - Okay. Once I get a little free time, I will come and visit you. - Alright Nandan, see you. - Okay. Where can you find the Pravasi chili powder? Yes Rametta. They left? Why can't they wait till I reach there? Yeah, it's okay. Let them go. Shift Murali from dispatch to the packing section. Okay. Ungrateful fellows. What happened Sir? Without any notification, a worker in the factory just disappeared like that. People nearby were employed in the hope that it would benefit them. But nobody is sincere enough. - We mostly employ outsiders here. - That's good actually. If any Bengalis or Biharis come here in search of a job, - Please direct them to my place. - Okay. Sir, here's the pravasi product you asked for. Pravasi? Which Pravasi? I didn't ask for it. Keep it there itself. - Akshaya Supermarket? - Irumbpalam. - Irumbpalam? - Alappuzha. Alappuzha. Where are they- Rajiv and Suraj? Both are on leave today. Apparently, it's their friend's sister's wedding today. So, the load to Alappuzha won't go today also. Why can't we employ people who don't have these kinds of friends and sisters? I was going to tell you that. A Bengali guy is waiting outside, in search of a job. - How's he? - Looks good. - Okay, how is your Hindi? - My Hindi is poor. Even my Hindi is poor. Anyway, call him. There's a guy standing outside. Call him inside. [Bengali theme music] [Bengali theme music] He's the owner of this place. - Greetings Sirji. - Yeah okay. - Please give me your blessings. - No need of that. [Broken Hindi] What's ...my name? [Hindi] My name? Rabindra. Rabindra Chadopadhyaya. [Hindi] There's a lot of work here. [Hindi] Yes Sir, not a problem. - [Hindi] - I... You... - What? - How do you say it? - What? I know a little bit of Malayalam Sir. So please don't worry. Oh, that's nice. You don't look like a laborer at all. Actually, I am a student. - My ambition is to become a doctor. - I see. I am repeating the medical entrance now. [Hindi] My father works as a security in a shop. [Hindi] He has very little money. To pay the fees and all. So, I badly need a job Sir. Good. Very good. - I have many further dreams sir. - What are they? After completing the MBBS, I would like to crack Civil Service. Your dreams are ambitious. I have even bigger dreams than these Sir. What are those 'bigger' dreams? I will reveal that to you once I crack MBBS and IAS. Yeah, let the MBBS and IAS dreams happen. If you are dishonest in your work here, you will regain consciousness only after reaching Bengal back. Understand? - Understood Sir. - Yeah good. - What's your name again? - Rabindra. Rabindra Chadopadhyaya. Please show the work here to Mr.Chadopadhyaya. - [Tamil] Come with me boy. - What? Tamil? For anyone who doesn't know Malayalam, Tamil is the best medium of language. - Okay. - [Tamil] Come boy. Wait a minute. - Now you may leave. - Okay Come. - [Tamil] Listen... - Yeah... - [Tamil] First you must pack all these. - [Hindi] Ok Sir. Are you studying and sleeping together? I fell asleep involuntarily. Have the juice. You will feel better. We should go for an India tour next year. - Where? - Not to any tourist place. To understand how students in different places are toiling hard, to earn their living and education. Today, a Bengali guy joined for work in the factory. Not just to earn a living for his family, His ambition is to become a doctor. He works hard and earns the expenses for the same. If you give me pocket money, I will also work after my class. This is funny for you. My eyes almost welled up when I heard some of his stories. He wants to try civil service after completing the MBBS. He studies in the middle of turmeric powder and chili powder, in the limited time he gets between work. Desires are the biggest ambitions of human beings. From his face, one can safely predict that he will conquer places. [Bengali theme music] - What's his name? - Rabindra Chadopadhyaya. He hails from Tagore's place, right? Might have been named after him. He has that positivity. Have your drink and then study. Why are you coughing and sneezing all of a sudden? I don't know. It might be the stress of the entrance preparation. Yeah. After this, have this dried ginger coffee. Okay. I will have that. - Go to bed early tonight. - Okay. Hello. [Bengali] How are you? What? [Bengali] How are you? Doesn't Mr. Chathopadhyaya understand Bengali? Yeah, I understood. I have been sneezing since noon. At least learn enough Bengali to scream out loud, when you get beaten up. Nothing like that. Father-in-law is a very nice person. I have powdered tons of love for him today. So, do you intend to live as a Bengali from here on? For a while. There will be a moment when he wishes 'what if this boy was a Malayali'. I will reveal the truth then. Most probably, that will be your last moment too. Don't try to scare me. Chathopadhyaya won't falter one bit. Sorry. I just sneezed. Alright. If you remain alive, see you again. Goodnight. - Rametta... - Yes... Please check the packing section. I will handle this. - Please tighten both the nuts. - Sure. Sir. Have some water. Okay. - Alright? - Yeah fine. - May I come in Sir? - Yes. You're late today too. - [Hindi] I had a lot of work. - [Everyone laughs] - What? - I had some work in the house, Sir. Okay, let's continue. Given, the mass of the planet is three times the mass of the Earth. Hey, Silence. If you come in, I shall make a special 'Dubai' tea for you. Have the 'Dubai' tea yourself. I have a cab booking. See you at night. At least take a break in one of the Sundays. I took the entire last week off. [chatter] This is my Dad. - Hi. Hi uncle. - Hi. These are my friends. Manasi - best friend. But that doesn't mean that rest of them aren't my best friends. Each of these are best friends only. If you had mentioned earlier, I would have bought food from outside. That's okay uncle. We ordered the food. It was a small house party. We were having combined study. We have an exam next week. We were preparing for that. Okay. You guys carry on. Let me just... - We are leaving uncle. It's late. - Is it? - Bye. - Bye. - Please take my bag. Bye uncle. - Bye. - I am taking this uncle. - Yeah Okay. Okay. Bye - Let me know when you reach home. - Yeah Sure. - Bye Uncle. - Bye. These days, it's common to have combined study and meet ups among kids. Why are you panicking for that Nandetta? I am not panicking. Still, I don't think it's necessary to have such intimacy with boys. Kids these days are much more progressive than us. They behave with so much freedom because they aren't fake about it. That's true. I really got scared when I saw the continuous missed calls. I was held up in packing. I left Xavier uncle's place. Oh, I see. By the time I reach back from office, Aunty would have made dinner and cleaned the kitchen. I was unable to help her even one bit. I was more like a guest there. Yeah. Fathima's roommate shifted out of the room at the correct time. So, I packed my bags immediately and came here. Alright. I was planning to call you once I get settled here. To be honest, I am fed up with this busy schedule Nandetta. I miss you and our home. But parents should keep an eye on their kids' affairs. All of a sudden, why are you installing the CCTV here? It's for our security Appu. If this was installed here on the day the robber barged into our house, I could have seen it on my mobile from Dubai. Big deal! Were you going to sit in front of this at midnight sans sleep? Even if you had seen it, you would have just panicked about it, what else? Now I am here only, right? Whatever happens here, I will be watching from my factory. - Rametta... - Yeah... All these bills are computerized, right? - Yeah. All of them are digitized. - Okay. Listen. Come with me. - What? - [Hindi] Is that your daughter? - Yeah. - She's very pretty. So? [Hindi] If the Dad is this handsome, daughter will also be pretty. Carry on with your work. Go man. When you reach a turning, you should put the indicator. - Understood? - Yeah. Just like that. Make the turn and drive smooth. Okay. So, this is the reason you are taking her out, in lieu of buying ice-creams. Are you in your senses Dad? If you let under-aged kids to drive, parents will be penalized. - But she drives well. - Yeah yeah. Didn't Mom ask you not to drive until you get the license? Why are you so stubborn and disobedient? You come inside. I have prepared special food for you. All of you have pampered her so much and have spoilt her. You stay silent. Nothing has gone wrong now. Didn't she drive with an aged person like you alongside her? If she had crashed somewhere, who would take the responsibility? Hey...Stay here. Appu... Dear, here's your ice-cream. Go and bring her back. - Hop in. - I shall walk. I said, hop in now. Please do it softly Appu. Teenage is the time when your character gets molded. If you don't control the unnecessary stubbornness and disobedience now, then even you may not be able to correct yourself. I had no issues before you came here. - I see. So, it's my problem? - Yes, may be. All those punishments that I have not given you for the last 14 years or so, Looks like, you are going to get them all together. I am not having dinner tonight. Goodnight. Appu. Appu, you haven't taken your lunch box. Here it is. Yes? I am thinking of going home this weekend. Okay. If you can grant me leave on Monday... Not just Monday, no one's going to get leave even this Saturday and Sunday. Each of you is assigned duty in the relief camp. I haven't been separated from my daughter for this long. Sir, that's why ... Why couldn't you stay home and look after your child? Did anyone of us mandate you to work here? This office is also an emergency center. Please remember that. Please come inside. You've got the Tahsildar's signature, right? Yes sir. Don't go back to the company now. Take the vehicle home and bring it tomorrow. - Okay Sir. - I shall inform Ramettan. Why are the lights not turned on? Appu. Appu. "The number you have dialed is currently switched off" There were a few guests here. Also, Nandan didn't inform me that you would be late today. So, I didn't go there. I can't get her on the phone too. She might be there at some friend's place. Yeah obviously. Please inform Lorens when he comes home. When your Mom walked out of this house, leaving all of us in utter dismay; There were many who suggested us to react strongly. The Commissioner and the MLA at that time were our father's students. We could have just informed them. But do you know what our father told us that day? "We shouldn't do anything that might hurt her" That's the culture of this family. Culture and legacy of a family aren't born in thin air. Fundamentally, one needs to be well educated to achieve that. You already know, we are the children of Professor Varghese Kurian. Your Betty Aunty entered the service as soon as she completed her MTech. Now, she's the executive engineer in the water authority. Look at me, I am a double post- graduate and possess a PhD. You mother was also brilliant in her studies. But she could become just a graduate. Who's responsible? Your father. When I speak about your father, I can't help saying this. He just completed his tenth standard. Then he arranged a certificate from ITI or something, and then fled to Dubai just a mechanic. So that culture difference will be evident in his character and parenting. Nandan is here. But you should understand something. Your father has the heart of gold, filled with love. He is scolding you and advising you, only for your good. You're lucky to have such a father, right? You have a long life. I was telling them about how a father should be. Yeah. That's good. If you were coming here, why didn't you just call and inform me Appu? Did she come here without informing you? Dear, that's really bad. Come. Let's go. Let her stay here tonight Nandan. I will drop her home in the morning. No, that's not necessary. It's not that late too. Pick up the bag. Come. Dear, go with him. Your father is calling you, right? Go with him. Appu... Appu... Nandettan is getting worried for no reason. I was with her till now, right? I know her. She has none of those problems that you are worried about. At times I feel, I shouldn't have come back home. Please Nandetta. Teenage brings about such changes. A few of them will have such mood swings every month. At that time, they will get angry for no reason. Talk without any control. But that will change soon. If you handle her softly, Appu is such an innocent girl, isn't it? She just needs to know that you love her and you care for her. She's a nice girl. She's our daughter, right? You just calm down. Yeah. You go to bed. "Oh my darling" "You're always my little one" "My unquenched sweet little dream" "When you sing, my mind is moonlit" "When you droop, my mind is in pain" "For the smiles to return to her lips," "Like a flower so soft" "I will stand beside you always, like a night that never blinks" "Oh my darling" "Oh my sweet darling" "Long are those eyes," "Adorned beautifully" "To tie the hair long," "For you, my sweetheart" "You are the sky that is spread around my life" "You are the rhythm that resonates in my soul" "I shall caress you, my little one" "Like a soothing breeze" "Be the shade that embraces your journey" "Oh my darling" "Oh my sweet darling" I miss you, Mom. I want to see you, Mom. I just need you, Mom. Don't cry Appu. I will come very soon. Be a good girl and don't cry. Please. "In the distance so far, without seeing you" "All those tiny moments these days" "Burned and bruised is my mind" "In the heat of this pain, deep inside" "In the deepest wounds of my mind, you are my source of solace" "Like those tiny droplets of honey" "You are the spring in my treasure, that never fades away" "My heart is filled with the scent of rose water" "Oh my darling" What happened? Vehicles can't go through, the mountain pass has broken down. "You're always my little one" "My unquenched sweet little dream" "When you sing, my mind is moonlit" "When you droop, my mind is in pain" "For the smiles to return to her lips," "Like a flower so soft" "I will stand beside you always, like a night that never blinks" "Oh my darling" "Oh my sweet darling" Today's Sunday, right? Please stay ten minutes more Fathima. No. Shall we go and have a cup of Horlicks then? This is a hostel. Rest of them are already teasing me. - Okay. - Do one thing. When you come for the next surprise visit, come with a Horlicks bottle. Leave now. Please. How was your husband's surprise visit? He is one of a kind-one who adds 'sugar into the sugarcane juice' kind. What's that? The kind of deep love that may ultimately destroy us. He will call a dozen times every day. We only get an off day on Sunday and we have lots of errands to meet, right? That's when he comes all the way from Kozhikode, on his bike. My entire day is wasted. Didn't you have a love marriage? I was so naive then. Now I feel, I should have delayed my marriage. I am kind of getting bored of him. Your case is entirely different, right? I was just 19 years old, when I walked out of my home to be with Nandettan. We haven't even proposed our love for each other until now. Then? There came a moment when we couldn't live without seeing each other. We were not brave enough to disclose it to our family. I got confused. Then Nandettan told me, "We won't be able to convince them. We can only live happily and show them that." The very next day, I got out of my house. Well, I can't blame you. Anyone will fall for that dialogue. Initially we couldn't even take our eyes off each other. Then our daughter was born. She became the center of attraction then. Nandettan was everything to her. He took care of her like a mother. He just handed her over to me, only for breastfeeding. That very person... He went to Dubai for 15 years, to provide a better life for her. Everyone sees an expat's wife in a strange and funny way. But only those who suffer that feeling, understand the real pain. The life we dreamt together, we started living it much later. That's when I had to come here. So please inform your 'sugar cane juice' to add a little less sugar. After a point, you will be missing his impromptu bike trips the most in your life. He just sent me a picture of the Horlicks bottle. Let me just call him. He might not have reached far. Listen boy, do one thing. - [Hindi] What sir? - Oh No! - [Tamil] Sir will be reaching now. - Okay. [Tamil] You know the table on which the computer is kept, right? - Yeah. - [Tamil] Clean that fast. - [Tamil] I have a little work outside. - [Hindi] Okay Sir. Rohit: I see you. Rohit: I see you. Rohit: When I look at you like this, I can't see anything else around me. Rohit is typing... Rohit: Never mind, a little chili powder had gone into my eyes. That's why! Appu: [Angry smiley]. Rohit: Just kidding. I will go to any extend for you. Appu: My Dad will be waiting for you there. He will kill you in one knockout blow. Rohit: I don't care. Your Dad isn't a concern at all. Dear Chathopadhyaya. [Hindi] Your garden is very beautiful. I was looking at that flower. [Hindi] I am sorry Sir. Oh sorry. I am sorry Uncle. I am not a Bengali. I am just a Malayali from Vazhakkala. My father is an advocate, mother is a housewife. My sister is an MBBS student. I have been repeating entrance exams for the last three years. Apart from this, I don't have any other liability. Aparna and I are at the same coaching center. But I am elder to her by three years. By the by, I love her a lot. I would like to marry her. But when she said that she won't consider me unless her Dad likes me, I thought of this idea. Please don't kill me. Carry on with your work. You don't leave. You sit here. Sit. Dad... Don't complaint about me not getting into the kitchen anymore, alright? I have prepared a superb vegetable biriyani. Of course, I checked the YouTube. Yeah. What happened? Not in a great mood? Come and sit here. Today, I fired Rabindra Chathopadhyaya from the factory. He's not like what I thought. He is very cunning. Didn't you say that he was very smart? He's smart. But he's a little too smart. Just like you. Both of you made a fool out of me. Don't blame me for that. It was his sole idea to impress you by working there. Is spite of knowing that, why didn't you mention that to me? I thought it was just a funny attempt by a friend. How can I betray him then? What's so funny about making a fool out of your father? Why are you so serious about this Dad? He is not a harmful person at all. Appu, you have every freedom to express anything to us, right? Like...about this guy who is stalking you. Or the masquerade he was doing... Can't you reveal it to us? We also might have enjoyed it. But this was a total mockery. You seemed to not trust me at all. How do I trust you, Appu? Didn't I directly introduce him to you at the factory? Both of you acted well in front of me then. This wasn't a one odd day kind of joke thing, right? Didn't you guys chat today? Show me your phone. Let me check who your friends are and what you're chatting with them. Nobody has the right to infringe into someone else's privacy. This isn't anyone else. I am your father. Appu, I am asking you to leave it. Leave it to me. Appu. Hey... Appu. Where are you going? It's difficult for me to stay with a person who doesn't trust me. Appu, don't take the car. I don't need your permission to take this car. My Mom's family bought her this car. Appu. Appu, stop. Hey Appu...Appu... - Are you alright dear? - Yeah...but... - But? - There was someone in front of the car. I saw him fall off after the crash. - Goodness! - Appu... Dear, please hold this. - Appu, get into the car. - Dad, where are we going? First, let's take him to a hospital. Come. It will be a Police case then, right? I don't have the license. You were not driving. I was. We should say like that. Come. But do you have the Indian license? - It's Nandan. - Okay. Hello... What? And? Don't panic. You go directly to Simon doctor's hospital. Yeah. If they can't recognize you, just introduce yourself. I will call and talk to them. No. Don't worry. I am coming there. I will take care of it. - What happened? - Take my shirt. There is no internal bleeding or any such complications. Lucky. There's a ligament injury in the hand and has bandaged the same. We shall observe him for some time and then you can take him home. Uncle, you are also a doctor, right? Just take care of him. Doesn't your Dad come here? Yes. He has OP in the morning and leaves after that. After that I manage it here. - Okay. - Thank you. Thank you doctor. - He's happy. - Yeah. [Everyone laughs] - Why's he laughing? - I have no idea. Please forgive us. We have no idea who you're and where you're from? It was a mistake. Please forgive us. We shall do anything for you. [Speaks Kannada] What? [Speaks Kannada] Kokila? [Speaks Kannada] [Speaks Kannada] [Speaks Kannada] [Speaks Kannada] [Speaks Kannada] Doctor. He's conscious now. But he talks gibberish. That too in some other language. Don't worry about that. Scans are all normal right? This is a post-concussion symptom. There will be a slight memory loss. But it will be fine anytime soon. Wait for another two days. If it's still a problem, contact me then. Alright. - Okay? - Yeah. [Kannada song] [Kannada song] Dad. [Kannada song] [Speaks Kannada] Okay. Yesterday...The hand... How's the pain? [Speaks Kannada] What? He's saying he doesn't remember how this happened. - How did you understand that? - Google translator. Oh okay. [Kannada] Kokila, my dear. Please go make two cups of tea for them. - [Kannada] Come and sit. - No, I will come. - [Kannada] Come and sit. - Yeah, I will come later. - [Kannada] She will make the tea. - Just a minute. - [Kannada] What happened? - We will come now. When did he wake up? He woke up long back. I checked on him when I repeatedly heard him calling 'Kokila Kokila'. He asked for a tea then. He was rambling on since then. - He's saying, I am his daughter - Kokila. - What? Kokila. Go to him. Damn. What do we do now? - Nanda... - Yeah... - Let's do something. - What? Forget it. Dad, he needs another shirt. A shirt of this size? Give one of my shirts. Okay. - Dad. - Yeah. Come here. Is he crazy? Anyway, let's not take the risk. It's better to inform the police. We have done everything that can be done, right? It will be completely chaotic then. If this becomes a case, every one of us, including Appu, will be in trouble. If this is a memory loss like the doctor said, we shall wait. Once the memory returns, we can handle him somehow. - Dad. - Yeah. I got this from his shirt's pocket. It's a bill from a wine shop. Meghna Wines. Arthanahalli. [Kannada rhyme song] Sir, Greetings... [Kannada] Greetings. Do you want the banana? No thanks. You may have it. - Karnataka? - Hail Karnataka. Yeah. Hail Karnataka. A place in Karnataka. Arthanahalli? - Arthanahalli? - Yeah, Arthanahalli. I told you know. We can crack this. In Arthanahhalli, how about wines? [Kannada] Oh alcohol, is it? I am always ready. - Listen, I shall buy some brandy. - You stay silent Dad. I wasn't talking about having liquor now. I was asking about Meghna Wines in Arthanahalli. [Kannada] What are you saying? I don't understand anything. How will I make him understand this? Bullshit. Meghna Wines in Arthanahalli? [Kannada] Tell me the rest of it, you idiot. [Appu laughs] - Stop laughing and bring my phone. - Hey... [Kannada] Do not raise your voice at her. She's my daughter. Please give me my phone. Can I click a picture? - [Kannada] You want a picture? - Yeah. - Selfie? - Yeah. - Dad? - Yeah, my Dad. Give it to me. Come Dad. Very nice. [indistinct chatter in Kannada] - Arthanahalli? - [Kannada] Yeah. Do you know him? [Kannada] I don't know. [Kannada] I don't know. Wait. I just want to know whether he's from this place? - [Kannada] I don't know. - Brother. Wait. What's this? [Kannada] Sir, please come. Do you want tea or coffee? Do you know him? [Kannada] Sir, we are poor people. Please don't bother us. Kindly go away. Not that. I just want to know whether he's from this place. [Kannada] Sir, please leave us alone. [Kannada] I have no idea who he is Sir. [Kannada] Please leave Sir. I am getting scared. [Kannada] He's not a good guy. Please go sir. [Kannada] Please don't trouble us sir. Please Sir. - [Kannada] I beg you. Please leave. - Okay. Brother, can you please tell me who this is? [Kannada] Look man, don't spoil my mood in the morning. Please go. Hey brother. Come. Thank God. He's a Malayali. - What do you want to know? - I want to know about a person. No one is helping me out. - Sir, are you Police? - No, I am not. Do you know who this is? This is Garuda Naik. He's the biggest gangster in Arthanahalli. Oh my God! Even the Police is scared of him. Do you want to see the fight that happened in this market last week? Come. I will show you. - The Police only installed this here. - Oh okay. - Can I get a soda? - Yeah. He had a good job in a company in Bangalore earlier. Then he lost his way. Now his main job is to take contract to kill people. He receives such contracts from Kerala and Tamil Nadu. He does all these single handedly It's been a while since we have heard about him. God knows where he is. After Julie has left this place, nobody waters the plants or cleans the area. Both the father and daughter are useless people. Where's he? He has been playing with Appu since morning. He's her new father, right? He is tying a swing for her behind the house. You have left her alone with him, is it? What's this Dad? Please hold this. [Kannada song] Appu, go inside. [Kannada] How many times have I told you not to yell at my daughter? - My hand hurts. Please forgive me. - It's okay. Nonsense. You come with me. Why are you scared like this? He's an innocent guy. A very normal person. No, Dad. He's a bomb. An atom bomb that can explode anytime. Come. [Kannada song] How did it go? I have given the sleeping pills. There won't be any issues till morning. Why did he come to our place? His job is to take contracts for killing, right? He might have taken up some jobs here. That's not the issue now. We should somehow get rid of him. Think of a way to do it. He can regain his memory anytime. If his memory returns, then there's nothing to worry. How's that? He won't spare any of us. Oh, come on. Don't be so scared. We, Malayalees, are not that futile. After listening to the anecdotes about him by the people there, my hands haven't stopped shivering yet. - What's the name of his place? - Arthanahalli. You just mollycoddle him and get him into the car somehow, Then you take him to some area in Arthanahalli and dump him. Never turn back after that and come straight back home. Just like how we dump cats at some places, Do the same thing. Are you ready? I am always ready. It's really an adventure. Okay. Let's do that then. [Kannada] Where are we going? - We have to go to the hospital. - [Kannada] Why? We should change the bandage. [Kannada] This isn't a problem. Doctor will cut and remove this bandage. - Remove it? - Yeah. - [Kannada] That's good. It itches. - Yeah, itching itching. Let's go. [Kannada]Dad, I will go to the hospital and come back. Okay. - [Kannada] Who's this? - My friend. Okay. Be careful with your legs. I didn't expect to cage him this soon. - Yeah. Arthanahalli is near to Mysore. - Yeah. It's not possible to go there and come back in a single day. Okay. Since Appu is alone, let Mom sleep alongside her at night. - You people take your time. - Yeah. But be careful. Don't halt the car, until you cross the border. I won't apply the brakes until we reach this 'Halli' place. Okay. Kokila. Come. Kokila will stay here. [Kannada] If Kokila doesn't come, then I also won't come. Once we remove the plaster from the hospital, we can come back soon. [Kannada] Call Kokila. You people leave. Kokila and I will come in another vehicle behind this. [Kannada] I will come in that vehicle. The girl can't come to the hospital. [Kannada] If I punch you, you will be stuck on the wall. Dad, I will also come. Appu, Arthanahalli is very far from here. That's okay, let's not cancel the journey because of this. Appu, get into the car. Get in fast. [Kannada] I am here for you dear. Don't worry. You've been on your phone since the time we got back from office. What happened? Both the father and the daughter are not picking up the phone. I haven't talked to them properly for the last 2- 3 days. When I called yesterday, one was fully engrossed in her studies, and the other was fully engaged in meetings. They might be held up. Yeah. But we get tensed if we don't get them on phone, right? The Superintendent isn't giving me leave either. Once they are free, they will call back. Take a bath. - [Kannada] Are you hungry dear? - What? - [Kannada] Shall we eat something? - No. [Kannada] Stop the car in front of that Dhaba. - [Kannada] Let her eat something. - Okay. - [Kannada] Kokila... - Yes. [Kannada] Dear, don't hesitate to eat whatever you want. okay? [Kannada] Hey man. Garuda is here. [Kannada] Yeah. [Kannada] - Do you want this dear? - No. [Kannada] You should eat vegetables. [Indistinct conversation] - Dad. - Appu, move away. Lorens. Karate? I have not been practicing it for a while. Now it's fine. [Indistinct laughter] [Indistinct laughter] Appa. - [Kannada] Mom? - [Kannada] I am coming dear. Kokila. [Kannada] Come on. [Kannada] Come on. - Where are you going? - What about him? Didn't we come to dump him? - Come. Let's go. - Appu. Come. Get into the car. Appu. [Kannada] You're not my Kokila. [Kannada] But you've the same eyes. [Kannada] the same smile. [Kannada] the same mind. [Kannada] Everything is the same. Where's Kokila? [Kannada] Here (in my heart). [Kannada] Kokila was a very good daughter. [Kannada] But I wasn't a good father. [Kannada] You're a very good daughter. [Kannada] Your Dad is a very doting father. [Kannada] Be happy my dear. Bless you. Appu, please don't shout like this. I will handle your Dad. I will come today. Please be patient till then. Pass the phone to your Dad. Nandetta, how many times have I told you to leave her alone? Why are you still fighting with her? Isn't she a child? If she says something wrong, we should forgive her, right? Please Nandetta. I will reach there tonight itself, whether I get leave or not. If it's for the leave... It's not for the leave. This is my resignation. I don't need leaves anymore. I don't need the job either. Wait. Listen. Don't lose your job, I will sanction the leave. That's up to you Sir. Hey. Why are you running so fast? Why are you staring like this? I am confused whether this is a dream or not. Don't get confused. It's a dream only. For certain dreams to be a reality, we might have to patiently wait for some time. Mom, come. There are a lot of stories I need to update you with. Come. - Dad. - Yeah. Rabindra Chathopadhyaya. - Who's that? - That's one of the stories. [Daughter]
