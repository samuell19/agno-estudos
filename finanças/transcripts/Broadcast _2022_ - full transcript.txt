- Having fun, sweetie? - Yeah. At the time, it seemed like our story was predictable, calm... safe. And here at Paragon Council Industries, as the worldwide leader in biomedical sciences, we are proudly developing a sustainable treatment regimen that's been producing incredible results. Combating debilitating fear in individuals. You all being here means a lot to us. We are aware of how much of a commitment this will be. However, please know that I'm equally committed to you and your treatment. This place is the ideal environment for us to take a very deep dive into your conditions. You're in good hands. I think you will all be pleased with the results. You sound very certain of yourself. I am. Let's for a moment try to imagine a scenario where you no longer have to suffer. That is the beautiful reality I'd like to expose you all to. And I look forward to getting to know each of you - over the coming weeks. - Well, wonderful. If you'd all kindly follow me. Let's take a tour. Welcome to PCI. Don't even ask. I wasn't goin' to. Good, because you know what the answer would be, Bob. We're not meeting on dry land, because I don't wanna be in the company of those who seek solid ground beneath them. I know. Good. They're beneath me. So what's up? How's everything in my company, Bob? Everything's okay. New batch starting today? Yes. What? The new guy, Meredith hired. I don't know. You don't know what, Bob? I heard him rehearsing his lines. It... it's not good. Oh, rehearsing his lines. Well, Meredith hired him. He has no tact. She's your right hand. I don't know what to tell you, Bob. This guy... I don't wanna hear this, tell it to her. Okay. Full report. Two males, two females, as requested. Uh, cleared 100%. They're at their orientation as we speak. Excellent. And they met all the requirements? They all have extreme cases of thanataphobia. Let's hope the rest of the world does, too. Cheers to job security. What was the name of your childhood pet? Spork. I don't make the rules. Next! Yeah, I'm just concerned. Good. Look, Vivian's right there with him. She's solid. Careful. So you've all had an opportunity to see our operation and meet with key staff and... May I ask? The nametags. You said you wanted to get to know us, but I don't see how calling us by... I realize that this seems a bit unorthodox, but it is all with intent. There is a reason for everything that we do here. Your conditions are extreme. And thus, to a degree, our treatment methods follow suit. Now, there are a few other, perhaps, unnerving elements of your stay here. Until further notice, you all will be wearing specially-fitted suits. They will cover you from head to toe and will be worn at all times. They are tamper-resistant, only we can remove them, and we will do so at the appropriate time. How are... how are we supposed to take a shower or a... Uh, here you are about to enter is one of the cleanest environments in the world. Um, I don't consider that an answer. What about, when we gotta go? Any and all procedures will be explained. I should have asked you to record it for me. I feel like I'm missin' out. Yeah. I told you when I came up with it, right? Yeah. I'm sittin' there on the throne, just pops in my head. Sittin' there laughing hysterically, Bob. Had to be for ten minutes. I'm laughin' my ass off. I'm glad this is all so amusing. Well, it is. I'm the one that's gonna watch it. De-familiarization stage, Bob. It's so funny to me. Stupid, but fun. One more item I'd like to share. There will be no reflective surfaces anywhere in the environment. Until further notice, you will no longer be able to see yourselves. Without going into detail, a separation from your familiar selves, at this crucial time, plays a vital role in your therapy. This is called the "de-familiarization stage". It is important to remember that all of this, everything that we do is for your benefit. It's been a long day for all of us. Get some rest. We have a lot of amazing work to do. My parents met the Lloyd's on vacation one year. I'm glad they did because Olivia came into my life. Hey, Jade, come on in. - Hi! Hi! - Jadey, I missed you! Hey, your school break couldn't come at a better time. My God, I got so much goin' on at my office. Wow! And you know, how busy uh, Meredith is. It's just crazy. We're gonna have lots of fun, bugger! Yeah. Cool. Well, look, I know it's late. I am going to get ready and head to my office. Try to get some work done while it's quiet. - You good? - Yeah, I'm here. Good. The guestroom's all set. Uh, we got you a flatter pillow. Thank you, Mr. Lloyd, and thank you, dear Olivia. Hey, and I you know, I don't know when Meredith will be home. What can I say, you are a lifesaver. - Give me a hug. - Hmm. - Goodnight, Mr. Lloyd. - All right. And I won't let her stay up too late. Don't worry. Hey, why're you here? It's late, my friend. Look at this list. All of them. Gone. You're acting like I didn't tell you a month ago this would happen. - How is this not... - Brady, relax. I got something I wanna show you. Is that what I think it is? But first, Brady, may I say that your daughter is a gem. Come on. Olivia just adores her. All kidding aside, you've done a wonderful job raising her all these years yourself. It's almost done. Whatever happens here, we'll be fine. Wait. Hidden in plain sight. Brilliant. But Myles, you know how things are. Since, I mean, artificial intelligence, it brought the world to the brink. It's harmless. They'll allow it. This is our ace in the hole. Okay, time to get ready for school. People, the time is now, and you all know it. - Meredith. - Bob. Everything is a go. There are people downstairs right now. They are living proof. We've been at this same point for what, two months now? We've done it. We cracked the code. We found a cure for death itself. Revolutionary doesn't even begin to describe it. All we need now is for the vote to be ratified by us. By you. All of you extremely important individuals here in this room. Today your board actually voted? You're playing God. You wanna talk about playing God? Your game, your kids' game. You're solely responsible for putting every kids TV network, the entire industry, out of business. No. It doesn't compare. What I'm doing is simple progress. And so am I. You can't be serious. Meredith, hasn't PCI caused enough pain? This time around, everything's just gonna go exactly as planned? You're gonna make people live forever? Come on. So... how did Meredith do this morning? Good, they're voting in favor of the next round of trials. I put up a good front. Made us seem reluctant. I... I... I think you would have been impressed. I am impressed, Bob. Not that I'm not actually concerned about things, of course. That's what I pay you for. What else? We took off the suits. They saw their gray skin. Well, it's for the best. Why keep them in the dark any longer than we need to? Soon. I've been hearing that for months! This wasn't part of the deal. I wanna get out of here! I hear you loud and clear. We're just asking for a little more patience. A little while longer and you get to go home. And don't forget about the compensation. It is a lot of money, and we all do really appreciate that. But what about this? We're working on that. I'm goin' to the office. Of course, you are. The thing is uh, because we've kept them here longer than we said, they're starting to get restless. Oh, are they now? They're anxious to leave. Bob, do me a favor, and grab your phone. How many subjects, since day one, Bob, how many have we paid? Uh, uh, uh, I don't know. Yes, you do, Bob. You know precisely how many. Including this batch of four uh, 41. Okay. Let's do some simple math here. What would you say is the average amount of money we paid each subject? The average. Probably around a million. Bobby, Bobby, Bobby. Let me help with this one. The average negotiated price, the going rate, has been 1.2 million. 1.2. So multiply 41 times 1.2 million. What you get, Bob? 49,200,000. Okay, good. Now, divide that by four. 12, 300,000. Good, good. Okay, so here's the deal. Because I have received zero return on my investment so far, I'm into these current four subjects for $12,300,000 each, Bob. Each! Do you really think I care if they're getting restless? Input object. You lied! We've been over this, yes? But that's so wrong. You had no right. You signed the papers. Oh, but that was more of a textbook. You... you cannot have expected us to have read all that. That's exactly what we expected. You're cured of your fear now, aren't you? Well, obviously. But I know what you were doing. The nametags, and the suits, and... and not bein' able to see ourselves, that wasn't part of any fear therapy. That was just a big distraction. When you came here, you were at complete odds with yourself, remember? The fear of death paralyzed you. You don't feel that way now. All you're feeling now is anger, and maybe a bit of betrayal. Those are two emotions that dissipate, clinically proven. And don't underestimate the importance of your role here. You and the others will be revered. Is that all? - Boo! - Oh! What are you doin' up? You need to get back to bed, monster. Raar! ♪ Think you're so cruel ♪ ♪ No, no, no ♪ ♪ Acting more like a fool ♪ ♪ I know you think you're clever ♪ I call Olivia "a bugger", because, she just loves ladybugs. Whenever she plays her game, the story always has to be about ladybugs. Hi! I'm Polly. What's our story gonna be about today? - Hello. - Hello. Input object. Where's Polly?

These gray aristocrat statues in their interminable bliss, all fawning over their fashion and indulgence, while those who chose differently, ephemerals... are left in the streets. This wasn't the kids' game. This console was different. I remember the day the world was introduced to all of this. It was at Townsend's General. There was a crowd of people fixated on the TV screens in the storefront window. What's this? What are they sellin' now? Paragon Council Industries claim was that their new drug INOC would make us live forever. So, how's Amber? She saw her brother like this and flipped out. Oh, she'll be fine. So don't overreact. My transmogrify only took me four days. I mentioned that, didn't I? Can you believe it? How lucky was I? You know, it takes time, but once he gets through it... Oh, let's have tea! Charlotte. I know I sound like a broken record, but... Here it comes. Well? I know, I just... I'm contemplating, that's all. That's all? What is there to think about? It's amazing! What we have now, this gift, it's wonderful! Oh, you. Sweetie, your name is on the list. They'll call you soon, you'll go down, you'll get your INOC. It's a little shot, in and out. I just... I... I don't know what I want, I guess. Charlotte, what more could you want? What? You know, my mom never thought this was a gift. - It seems unnatural to me. - Maybe. Unnatural? What is more natural than being here and happy with me, forever? And what about that daughter you said you always wanted? I can still have a daughter. I know, sure, but she's just going to die eventually and what is the sense in that? I mean... time was always the problem. There simply wasn't enough of it to get the full experience, that is. And now? You never run out of it. It was so surreal. Looks like you have goodies for me today, Bob. Yeah, there's a lot here. The pre-launch. Going well. The uh, pharmacies are already setting up the health screenings. Uh-huh. And these pharmacies... Legal has already vetted them thoroughly. All signed off. They know they'll lose their bonus. We're only working with pharmacies that are struggling financially, just like you said to, so I'm sure they'll... The power of money, Bob. Yeah. He wants to know if you're on the list. I am, but I'm not waiting. I've been on the list too long. Can you do it? Olivia. Your game. What did you do to make that story? I didn't do anything. - Olivia. - What? I didn't do anything. It's just not fun anymore. I don't wanna play it anymore. Well, you know what, bugger? I don't feel like making lunch anymore, how about that? Feel like going out? - What? - Um... I'm on my way out. What? - They... - They? They said it isn't feasible. It is in fact, impossible, as they see it. We can figure out how to live forever, but we can't figure out how to not have gray skin? What is it? The gray. Look, I could figure this shit out, but I'm not gonna do it, I'm not goin' back in the lab. Did you know... after you cook a lobster, if the meat is so gray, that means it's been dead too long? No, I didn't. You gotta read more books, Bob. Well, I don't really have the time. Let me think about this. Let me think about this. Let me think. I didn't know you liked it that much. You're not the only one allowed to have fun. My game isn't fun anymore. Yeah. Well, I'm gonna go upstairs right now and fix it for you, okay? I told Olivia that I would fix her game. Truth is, I just hooked the new game up in her room and I took hers. This way, she could play her game and... And I could keep watching the story. Hi, I'm Polly. What's our story gonna be about today? Olivia! - Did you talk to Amber? - No. They'll pick us up off the ground one day, too. Okay, Ro, don't get yourself all worked up. You're stupid. You're crazy. Yeah, that's like it. Gentlemen, please, careful. Right on the gurney if you would please. I'm gonna make you look regal. Here we are. This will do just fine. You are a dignified gentleman and you will look as such. Fine gentleman, I will be right with you. Please stop! - What are you doing? - We need to dig up our boy. - What? - We need to bring him back! Forgive me, what do you... Wait, I know you folks. I know you both! I provided the service for your son some time ago. I'm... I'm sorry, but what are you doing? We ca... they... they can bring him back. I would help you dig if I thought it would help you bring your son back. We miss him so much! I know you do. Why don't you come back with me, dry off, and maybe have a drink or something, okay? They wanted forever with their son, but now they'll never have that. You see, my friend... I believe they would have, had they simply lived their lives and died naturally. Like you. Now reunited with your loved ones. Forever requires faith. I've seen you before. You get your papers out of the dumpster. The whole world is fallin' apart. That's for you. Thanks. You poor thing. It's so sad. They give me the creeps. The story went everywhere, all because of a few dolls and Meredith's brochure. Hello. Yes? See anything that tickles your fancy? Anything but these. These are mine. Yes? Ah! - Mom? - Charlotte. Sweetie... you can't. What? Accept what they call their gift. I miss you, mom. There's my sunshine. Mmm, warm. Helps my brittle bones. What do I do? When you make promises, you're going to keep them. That's everything. Mom. My pretty girl. I love you so much. So, when you're making these calls, it is very important that you sound convincing. No need to set off any alarms. Just tell them that you know, your treatment is going well, and that your trial's been extended, and uh... and that uh, you'll be in touch with them soon. What if they get suspicious? I know my family's worried. I wanna say this in the most sensitive and delicate way possible. PCI cannot afford a scandal or even a hint of impropriety. It simply will not do. It's in everyone's best interests to keep your loved ones at bay at this time. Whoa. That sounds like a threat. What can you do to me? You told me I can't die. There's nothing that we can do to you. It's your loved ones you should all be thinking of at this time. What do you say we make those calls? Hi kids, how're we doin'? You need to stop pickin' up strangers. Hello. What's your name, young man? I'm Dr. Calvin. Would you like to come in? It's okay. My name's Daniel. Okay, Daniel. So, when did you get inoculated? They just stuck me here. Did you get inoculated at a clinic? An actual INOC clinic? Ladies. Hmm. Okay, Daniel, try to stay with me, okay? Lovely, lovely lady dragonflies, and they float around my head, and they're all naked, and none of them have heads. So, I still hear them talk... even though they don't have mouths. Okay, so Daniel, I can deduce that you didn't actually get your INOC from a certified clinic. And you're certainly not in the reticent state. Daniel, that's bad. Daniel, listen to me now. I think that I can help you. I'm a doctor. I mean, I... I was a doctor before they closed the hospitals down. But I would like to try to help you, Daniel. This drug that Meredith's company is making... is this what it's going to do to us? Change everything? It made me think. Hi, honey. How was your day? It was great. I served old men coffee all day while they made their usual disgusting comments. Honey, I told you, I'm gonna go down there and put an end to all of that! Oh, that's a great idea, dad. Go down there and make a fool out of yourself. Get me fired. Then who the hell is gonna take care of us then? Take care of you? Honey, come on. When mum went away, you had tons of money. Honey, I'm tryin'. You're trying? You really wanna try, dad? Then try telling me what happened to mum. Why she ended up in that hospital? Not that again. Yes, this again. Honey. Just another secret, right? It is a gift, and by our divine clarity, we praise its nobility. Inherent, with unwavering commitment, vos shall see in all the beauty of the infinite, for our neoteric dawn will triumphantly continue within us. Keep its glory as we reside here forever. Be virtuous through endless days. Gather faithfully and committed to power. Jade, when I got home, I went to my office and I noticed that my console was missing. I can't believe you would take this without my permission. No, Mr. Lloyd, I... I didn't, honest. I mean... I mean, it's a long story. I... I have no idea how that happened. Olivia told me that... that her game was acting all... Did Olivia play this game? Did she see any of this? No, I took it from her when I... when I saw... Tell me she didn't see what I just watched. No, I took it from her right away and then I bought her a new one at the store. Okay. Okay. It wasn't enough to progress mankind. No. We had to reinvent it. What arrogance to think we had the right. Before all of this, anyone would admit that we were holding on by a thread... but at least we were holding on. Holding onto hope. To be decent. To be better... but this abomination took away that hope, and it took all the things that made us human... away forever. You need to show this to Bob! You're absolutely insane. I'm not showing my boss some stupid kids' game... This is not a kids' game. So that he can pull the plug on my project. This is not a kids' game that I'm talking about, Meredith. This... this is. Right. An AI something or other. Meredith, you know what I do. This other version that I created, it's limitless. It has... It has infinite intelligence. So what you're telling me is you brought a highly illegal piece of technology into our home, - with our daughter here. - Meredith. Something we could be arrested for, or worse. You don't understand. You don't understand. The console knows everything. Really? Maybe it knows where you went wrong with us. Meredith, just watch it. You'll see! If you do what you're plannin' on doin', it... it will destroy everything. Please, Myles. I'll bring it to your board myself, tomorrow. That's not a game you wanna play, Myles. You shouldn't have even let me know you were playing it. Daddy! Wait in the car. - Meredith turned me in. - What... what's going on? - Meredith turned me in. - What do you mean? Look, they're... they're coming for me. - Who? - Look, just... just listen. Just take this, okay? - They're coming for me. - Who? Look, I need you to take my daughter. Just take my daughter. Take her far away from here and keep her safe. Keep her away from Meredith! Away! I can't trust anybody. If they ask you, tell you that I... tell them that I told you to... I gave you permission to... to go on a trip with her. And uh, just keep Olivia away from Meredith. - Away, you hear me? - Yeah, okay. And take care of her. Promise me that you'll do that. I promise. I promise! I couldn't believe it. It was actually happening. ...encrypted code for his modified game console. It has been determined that the learning algorithms are leagues ahead of even what the government has ever seen. The fear is that technology this advanced, if in the wrong hands, could be catastrophic. After a month, Myles Lloyd still awaits trial. Additionally, there has been no new information regarding Lloyd's daughter, Olivia, who has been missing since the day of the raid. The A.I.D.A continues to urge the public to contact local authorities immediately with any information on her possible whereabouts. Get another lead. Time. It's a novel concept, I know, but I still keep track of it. It's been over two decades that I've been living down here, isolated from the madness up top. That's an unrecognizable place now. While the infinites enjoy their timeless days in grandeur, there are three sets of ephemerals enduring this new world. Those who are on the list, desperately waiting for their names to be called, those who are deemed too sick to receive their glorious gift, and those who think it's all an atrocity. Those are the ones who end up abandoned. We found her here last night. This is so sad. So, you're telling me, that Meredith's daughter is literally on the run with the daughter of one of the past subjects? This may hinder Meredith's performance, right when we need her the most. We should go now, Sarah. Come back for her. Perhaps no one will show, but someone may. We always have hope. Right to the end. Do excuse me for one minute, please sir. Sarah, what is it? Amber. Sherman, we need to talk about the gray skin. I got it all figured out. You do? Yes, I do, Bob. Okay. We'll all have the same color skin. So now, I'm gifting the world with more than just longevity, Bob. Think about it. - Sherman, that's... - I know it is. So what? We... we just run with it? That's why you're the face of the company, Bob and I'm the brains. Yes, we just run with it! Sherman. It's the water, Bob! The water! The reason I can think so clearly is all the time I spend on the water. Her name was Amber. She was a sweet young lady. The kids brought her to me, too. Those kids. They found her crying on a park bench. She said her parents threw her out of the house because she wouldn't take INOC. She knew she couldn't do it. The minute she saw her older brother after his visit to the clinic, sittin' there in this bedroom, just starin' out into space... the whole thing just scared her. There she is. Just... just seat yourselves right there at the table, boys. Uh, there. Just make yourselves right at home. Thank you, ma'am. We're from... Oh, I... I know where you're from. Finally. I... I've been waiting. Oh. I'm sorry. I... I... I... I'm just... I'm so excited. Uh... And here you are. Well, thank you for the... No, thank you. Thank you. So, we've come a long way to talk to you. Oh, wait, biscuits. I insist. They're from scratch. They're from scratch. One minute. Hey! Join in on the fun. Oh yes, we are going to have some fun. Boys, um, do you think that I should change? Ma'am? Um, well, this is just such a special occasion. If I had known... I would have done my hair. If we can get started. Could you tell us exactly where you were. And also when. It was clearly daytime but an approximate time of day would be very helpful. Uh, boys, I would like to play for you my favorite song, because this is such a special occasion. Wait. There. Ma'am, your... your music. Isn't it glorious? Can we kindly see the image on your cell phone? The print came on a bit grainy. Yeah, it... it would help if we could just see... Tho... those things? Boys, I tell everyone if you want to talk to me, you know where I live. We would like to see it anyway. Oh, I do have a spring dress. I do. It... it's... it's got polka dots. It's pink and black. Ma'am, we're here about the girl. Girl? The Lloyd girl. The missing girl. You sent the pictures from your cell phone. I told you I don't have a cell phone. You know, boys, I... I'm... I'm ready to go now. Ma'am, I'm sorry, there's some confusion. No! I am not too old! And I'm not sick! Boys, you came here, you came here to take me to the clinic... Ma'am, ma'am. We're not here for that. We're here to find the girl. I am the girl. I'm the one! I'm the one that you're looking for! The healthy girl! You'll see. They... when... when they see me at the clinic, they will know I am the healthy one. They will accept me. Oh, they will definitely accept me. When they see... when they see how able I am... When they see how able I am, they will... they will accept me. I'm... I am healthy. Watch. See, I can do jumping jacks! I can do jumping jacks! Ma'am, I'm sorry. We should... Look, I can... I can dance, too! Watch. Um, I can dance. I can dance. I can dance. This was a mistake. - I can dance! - So very sorry. Oh, please, I can dance! I can... oh, I can do jumping jacks. Watch. Have a good day, ma'am. Oh, I can do dance. I can dance. I can dance! Look, Jadey. Cool! I like it here. I wanna stay. Yeah, I like it, too, bugger. Then can we stay? I don't wanna keep going to new places all the time. You really wanna stay? Definitely. I love it here. Tell you what, we'll stay as long as we can, okay? Yes. You want to say somethin'? Say it. Why haven't you taken it? Hmm. You see that it works. Their DNA is regenerating perfectly. I will soon. I just have to wrap up my affairs and then I'll be takin' it. Why would you need to do that? Well, Bob... what if after I take it... things are different? Not following. You are followin', Bob, you always follow. You're just not listenin'. What are they now Bob, the four subjects? We know they were people who knew they're going to die. Now they believe they won't. Will they? Does it work? How do I know? You said it would. You're askin' me, Bob, and I'm really moved. But you're asking me if I'm so brilliant, I can create a new genus, Bob. At least I believe that's what you're asking me, right? Of course not. But that is what you're askin' me, Bob! Gender, male. Average lifespan, 79 years. Gender, female, average lifespan, 82 years. That's what I'm up against, Bob! But you hold me in such high regard. It's kind of embarrassing. The data says it works. The data. The analysis has been spot on. Yeah, so what? So, it works. Look around, Bob! I can't guarantee a win here! She's a tough opponent, the bitch mother nature. So, we launch INOC, knowing it might not work? Sometimes, Bob, the things you say. What are we doing here? It's just another promise! What? Bob, everything for sale is a promise. And it's so easy to embrace a promise. It's a promise. They're so fucking cute. Promise me you won't say anything. Promise. Promise me, promise me. A promise isn't good enough on this one, Bob. We need to sell hope. You with me? Hope. Do you know why? No. Because there's more money in hope than any other intangible commodity on Earth. Money? Oh, that's rich, Bob. You know, my grandfather, for years, told me that lobsters lived forever. He promised me that was true. And as a kid, I believed that. But let me ask you this, even after I found out that it wasn't true, and my heart was broken truly, and I knew it wasn't true, what was I left with? Hope. Hope! Sometimes, that's the only thing left behind from a failed promise, Bobby. That feeling of hope. It never fades, not even false hope. Don't ask me. Sherman, if we don't even know if it works... I never said it doesn't work! It could! But because you asked Bob, we're makin' money, that's what we're doin'. You don't need any more money, Sherman. You have enough to last a million lifetimes. The irony in what you just said. Sherman, at the very least, you figured out a way to slow down aging. - I... I mean that's... - That's what? Why don't we just pitch it that way? So we don't get torn to pieces? INOC is a drug that regenerates DNA. It prolongs life. I've thought about that, actually, but it's not enough! But if that's what it is, then... We don't know what it is, Bob! And you're forgetting about choice. What? Hasn't it crossed your mind that the world would need to make a choice? Every human being will have to choose between living forever... ...and good old Mother Nature. So curiosity? That's your motivation? Yes. It's everything, all of it. Okay, the way I see it, there are three likely outcomes. First, INOC prolongs their lives. We told them it would make them live forever, but we came up a little short. But they'll still line up to get it. Second, INOC doesn't work at all, makes people go insane or something, destroys humanity, whatever. We're not too far from that now, are we? Third, INOC actually works. We don't die. Their DNA keeps regenerating. I'm... well, at that point, I would be what? More than a messiah. I don't know what to say. Don't say anything. Whatever will be will be, Bob. The only difference is how I pitch it and I've decided to pitch it like this. The greatest invention for mankind and the greatest experiment on mankind! Not bad, huh? and it's all because of me. They said I wasn't gonna be around much longer. I... I figured that was it, Daniel. I'm not ready. I know. I know, Daniel. I know you're not ready. But no one really ever is. But it can't be changed. The world outside is trying. It won't work. Every story... has a beginning... and an end. You still up, bugger? Yeah. You okay? I hope dad's okay. I know what Meredith did to my mother and you let it happen. All right, time to go to sleep. It's me. It is you. It's so good to hear your voice. What is it? What do you need, honey? For you to listen. Okay. I mean it. Honey, what? I know what happened to mom. I know where you got all that money. I know everything. Dad? Yeah, we took a risk by going to town. We just felt like getting some ice cream. I figured who's gonna find us out here? In the middle of nowhere. I miss my dad. What about mom? Well, you know... I promised your dad that we would stick together for a little bit... and I made a promise to someone else about keeping promises. So, bugger, you're stuck with me. But you did find us. You mentioned this game. The console Olivia's father built. That's how you... That's how I know Meredith killed my mother. She can't hear us. I'm sorry, I sent you all those pictures. The old lady and the cell phone, how did you do that? Well, I just went online and I found there... a random name and address of someone who lives far from here. And then I went to a cell phone store. When the guy behind the counter asked me for my ID, I uh, I told him that I lost it along with my phone, and that's why I really needed one. I guess I flirted my way out of that and walked out of the store with a new phone in her name, and then I sent you the picture. How did you know I was looking for you? I saw Meredith's post about the reward she was offering for information on Olivia, and... and... I saw your contact information there. Well, for the first time in my career, I won't be delivering for a client. Mrs. Lloyd. No, used to be. Recently divorced. So, tell me you found them. No, sorry. I scoured the entire town. Showed the pictures to anyone who would give me the time of day. Went to the local police station, everywhere, and it's a small town, not a thing. Maybe the information you received was flawed. It happens. Maybe. I expect you'll keep looking. Of course. So, there is another matter I need to discuss with you however. Okay. It has to do with unauthorized human trials resulting in death, or some might say murder. We are back again, outside the now vacant Lloyd residence. Today, marks one year since the raid on this property and the ongoing saga continues. As has been highly publicized, Myles Lloyd has been without... Um, has been sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole, while Lloyd's daughter Olivia is still yet to be found. However, the story has now centered around Meredith Lloyd. Authorities have confirmed that four individuals were discovered at PCI and reportedly have been held there against their will. Each of these four individuals claim that they were initially recruited to be part of a clinical study pertaining to a medication that was supposed to help them with their phobias. They've all stated that instead they were given a drug called "INOC". A drug that they were told would make them live forever. Make them live forever. Forever. Well, that sounds absurd. Multiple sources speculate that the upcoming release of this drug is in fact, the catalyst behind the vast number of pharmacies providing free health screenings. Authorities have determined that Meredith Lloyd, without knowledge of or approval from PCI, has in fact performed unauthorized human... and is seemingly responsible for countless number of deaths. Clearly, this story isn't going away anytime soon and of course, we'll be right here to bring you the latest. This family. Uh, yeah. So, what are we just supposed to believe that PCI had nothing to do with this? That's the real story here, don't you think? I doubt that'll happen. Why not? We're one out of like a million subsidiaries that are all owned by, take a guess. Of course. All right, teleprompter rolling. In five, four, three, two... Dad? Honey, it was punishable by death. Then I'm all she has now.
