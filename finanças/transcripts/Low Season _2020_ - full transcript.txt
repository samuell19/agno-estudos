For a temple fair? A funeral. My cousin. Drowned in the canal right over there. Hear the water? It took us a whole day to find his body. He was all bloated and rotten. The smell was insane. Thanks for the details. I'm going to go to my room. Have a good night. Thank you. He went toad-hunting. Swollen as a toad himself... Lin! What's up? What took you so long to call? Sorry. Is that your room? It's pretty rustic. From the look of it... I bet someone died in there. Stop it! You're scaring me. Shit. I forgot my Buddha amulet. What should I do? Watch The Ghost on TV. To keep you company. You bitch! Bad reception here. Lin! Good luck, my friend. A funeral. Drowned in the canal right over there. Bloated. The smell was insane.

You should have told me you prefer sleeping outside. Rainy and cool. Outdoorsy girl. Hi, Pud. How was last night? Did you sleep well? Didn't sleep a wink. I was up all night. Someone turned up the TV so goddamn loud. Young people have no manners these days. Loud means the TV is working... You're talking about me? Look. Just say it. No need to be sarcastic. Right, I mean you. I walked through the rain and knocked on your door -to tell you to keep it down. -Was that you? -Damn right. -Why didn't you wait? I came out and saw nobody, so I thought... it was someone with bad intentions. Couldn't sleep all night. Neither could I. Good. We're even. -Even how! -Well. I couldn't sleep. You couldn't sleep. We're even. Don't be so daft. Have a light breakfast first. This will keep you slim. The weather's nice, calm yourselves down. I'll sing you a song. Easy-peasy, we Thais are so cheeky Take it easy, don't have to be nosy Pud! Taking a dump? Not a good time, there's no water. Watch your skirt, lady I don't want to be nosy Watch that skirt, don't be cheeky Watch carefully, I feel so lucky Easy-peasy, we Thais are so cheeky Hi, I want to go to Kew Mae Pan. Good luck, girl. Can we go now? No, we can't. I'm picking up that young man. Over there. Is there any other transport? Nope. Look... I... Hi Om, I'm waiting for you. What? You're not coming? Okay, fine. Look, I'd like to go to Kew Mae Pan. Can I ride with you? You sound desperate. Yes or no? Two thousand baht. -One thousand. -Two thousand. Final price. Cheap ass. Why are you in such a hurry! Damn. Pick up your trash. Take my jacket. Thank you. Warm enough? Lin. I love you, babe. Romantic crap. I wanna puke. I'll never forget the sparkle in your eyes. Asshole. You. Hey. How could you do this to me? -Calm down. -Why are you doing this to me? -Take a deep breath. -I'm not going to cry anymore! Then stop. You're embarrassing yourself. How did I get to this point? BE MY GIRLFRIEND BUT YOUR MOM DOESN'T LIKE ME! Seriously, what's wrong with seeing ghosts? You told him you could see ghosts? I did. How many guys have dumped you because of this? It creeps them out. From now on, keep it a secret. This is Gett, my best friend, who furiously protects my interest in everything. Look... I think... Don't tell anyone you can see ghosts. Okay? That's right. Life was easier after I followed my friend's advice. Until I met him. -What are you doing here? -His name's Tor. He's a senior at my university. The hottest guy on campus. You don't have to do this job. Shit. Help. I want to go home. Babe, I love you. Cut, cut, cut! So fuckin' good! He made my heart swell every time we were together. They already said cut. Oh, wait. It's overcooked. Just a bit, I don't mind. Come on. Move already. I'm starving. For you. Nice and yummy. I went to take a shit and the catering girl took my role. -Tor. -What? That hug scene was written for me. Right, I'll give you one. See you. When we're done, let me drive you home. Who would have thought that the hot guy would dig me! We were together for three years. After graduation, he became a superstar. With millions of followers. And me? A hundred people call me every day. How can I help you, ma'am? Shit. Are you cold? No. Damn it. Every day, I felt more and more uncomfortable. -Because I kept seeing ghosts. -Lin. Lin. What now? Tell me what’s wrong? I can't tell him, can I? You've been acting weird. I'm sick of it. Tor! Then again, what difference would it make? Who's she? My sister. Ah, your sister. Sister my ass! Scumbag! What are you gonna do? TOR'S AFFAIR WITH HIS CO-STAR Come on. It's not your fault. Tor was a nobody when he started dating you. Cry your heart out, then toughen up. Don’t let him know you're not okay. Are you alright? EIGHT WAYS TO FIX HEARTBREAK So? End it where it started. And that is... San Francisco. Lin. You've never set foot outside the country. Get real. Tell me where. Your stop. Okay. There's no need. Look... -Where are you going next? -Me? -I'm-- -Let me come with you. Let's go, driver. WE NEED THE SYNOPSIS AND CHARACTER SKETCHES BY TOMORROW! Open it. Are we almost there? Why? Sick already? I'm cool. For motion sickness. A bandage? Don't you know? Tape it over your belly button and you won't get dizzy. Nonsense. What the hell. Suit yourself. Hold on. A tree's blocking the road. We need a hand. Got it. -Alright. -Take that side. YOU WON'T FEEL LONELY, BECAUSE I'M RIGHT HERE WITH YOU. Together. Drag it over there. Take this. -See you. -Bye. Let's go. Give me a sec. Just a few cans and you're sick as a dog. Can you walk? Up. -We're ready! -Wait! What now? There. Father and son. Where? Ride with us. Plenty of room here. And your son. Cute kid. Let's go now. What? You're so heartless. Mean guy. Leave them out in the cold. Hey. What's your name? Lin. Why? Okay, the female lead is called "Rain." She arrives in the rainy season. She's 24, from Bangkok. Cute, but a real piece of work. A blabbermouth who gets on your nerves when drunk. The way she dresses is... a chaotic mismatch from head to toe. Bottom line: An eccentric woman. Eccentric and gullible. Another wreck. Tell me again if this is a camp or a rehab. A wreck still brings you money. The real problem is, we've arranged for a group of six but she's the only guest. Hey. Happy with your room? Yeah. Good. Listen up! Listen up, guys! Tomorrow I have some weaving to do. Feel free to cook for yourselves. I'd rather sleep. Noon, get your lazy ass up. Sleeping too much will tire you out. You have to get up and relax. Hair of the dog. Omm, here. -Returning? -Yes. -This too. -Ah, right. -Pud. -Yes? You're a rich boy. With a fancy camera and pricey laptop. But you have to borrow my soap, shampoo, and toothpaste. All my personal stuff. Fine. Next time you can go pick up the guests yourself. I won't do it anymore. And build a roof for God's sake. It's so damn hot. Hmm. Dig in, sis. Everything served here is organic. And tasty, because Aom is such a fine cook. Yep, because I sprinkled MSG in every dish. What? MSG? Of course. Why do you think it's so tasty? So the food isn't organic? It is organic. MSG is made from cassava. Cassava is a plant, so MSG is organic. God help my soul. No wonder my hair's falling out in clumps. Don't be so dramatic. -Would you two stop so I can eat? -It's okay, Pud. My mom said arguing while eating will get you a pretty young girlfriend. Then go eat somewhere else. No. I want to eat with you. -No. -Fine. Be nice. This one is undercooked. Guys... -What? -Where are we? Whoa! A head case. Pud, she's your responsibility. The girl's in serious condition. You look after her, Pud. Is there no reception here? There is. Just some networks. Definitely not mine. All done. Thank you. Come on, spill. What? Ugh. Only the heartbroken go on a trip alone in the low season. Thank you. Take that sleepy-looking guy. He said he came to find a place to open a café. One night he got wasted and confessed between sobs. His girlfriend of seven years dumped him for his best friend. Poor thing. He cried so hard his face started twitching. And that handsome artsy guy? That's my husband-to-be. Name's Omm. A computer programmer from Bangkok. He and his ex worked for the same company. Then she was sent on a business trip abroad. But she mixed business with pleasure. Got herself a white boyfriend, bam! He was so hurt. I came all the way up here and opened this camp. Luckily, he met me. Even luckier that I'm such a charming young lady. So we cure each other's blues. Without me, he would have gone south. Right. Come sit here. Maybe not everyone here is a wreck. Everyone, believe me. Look. That guy over there. The one with sad eyes. His ex is an indie film director. He's a screenplay writer. His script won her an award and they became a couple. But somehow the director ended up banging her actor. Don't tell him I told you. He got so hurt that he went mainstream. Came here to do research. He wanted to write a horror movie. Come on, he didn't have to come all the way here for that. His ex is scarier than any ghost. He didn't talk to anyone when he first came. The heartbroken are all the same. Listen. This chick right here... This one... is as beautiful as Elsa. She just dyed half of her hair. And wields a knife. She's a normal person. -Keep chopping. -Want more? Yep. To quench your thirst. -Ready? -Ready. Here we go. One, two, three. King! I got a king! Hey. That means I can give an order, right? Bring it on. Okay. Omm, be a girl. Hey! You are crazy, bitch. That doesn't make sense. A macho guy like me? Come on. Go! Do it. Be a girl. That's not girlie enough. Sluttier. Noon! Watch me, I'll be your bitch! Alright, Omm. That's enough. I can't stand it. -One more round. -One more? -One more. -Come on. Here, here. One each. Hurry up. Alright. You're the last. You are a hairy girl! I'm sexy and I know it! Alright. One, two, three. You're screwed, Noon. It's about to rain. Let's get inside. -It's raining already. -Wait. I got a king. We're staying here. Why would I do that? I'll let you all stay a month for free. I'm in. I don't think that's a good idea. You'll get sick. None of your business. I'll play. Okay. Bring it on. What's your order? I've got an idea. I order you to fill your mouth with rain, then fill up a glass. Hey, I won. Noon, drink it! C'est la vie. Nothing much to do here except hang out with crazy people. It's okay. That is fine with me. I think Noon has been in the toilet for too long. Has she? She's just taking a dump, Vittaya. You're being paranoid. What's wrong with her? She looks sane enough. Sane? You don't know shit. There she goes. I smell trouble. Let's take a look. Help me! Anyone? What are you doing up there? Get me out of here. Here's the door. I want to get out this way. Help me. I'll help you, Noon. Help me, new girl. Wait a sec. If you wreck the door, how are we gonna use the toilet? Squeeze more. You guys are useless. Bring me a chair, Vittaya. Out, out, out. Poor Elsa. Hold your breath. Take them, Vittaya. That's all it takes. Now pull back. -Here you go. -She's out. That's it. Now open the door. Asshole. Seriously, why did you put a ladder in the toilet? What ladder? It's a clothes rack. And the Oscar goes to you, for best dumbass. I don't want an Oscar. -Sure? -I want Nat. Stop it. Everyone, go to bed. I'm leaving now. Please don't, Noon. Vittaya, handle it. -How? -You are a scumbag. You prick, you surprised me on my wedding day! In front of everyone! You humiliated me in front of everyone. You're drunk. I'll take you to bed. -You fucking dumped me, Nat. -Come on. Let's go to bed. Yeah, let's go to bed. Good night, Omm. Is this camp only for the dumped? Yeah. Including you? WHERE'S THE SYNOPSIS? I NEED IT NOW! Shit! Wea a koh wea er jae Wea a koh wea er jae Your meal. Lin. What are you mumbling? Have your breakfast. Aom... Wea a koh wea er jae What does it mean? Make an offering for me. Who said that to you? Eat and wash your dish, okay? Wait. Where's... everybody? They left already. Want to come along? Or you can stay here by yourself. Whoa. City girl's never ridden a bike, eh? All the time! Hey. Be nice. I am. It's bumpy. Sit tight. You ride carefully. Wanna do it yourself? I don't know how. -Watch out! -Ugh. Slowly. You're wasting my time. You asked me to come along. Holy shit. Damn it. Pud. Hey. Are you okay? I can't get up. Sorry, sorry. Let's do this. Easy, Lin. No, no. Are you hurt? I am. My helmet! It's a rare item. My God. I'm fine. You're okay, Oldie? My goodness. Hey. Be careful. Lin. I'm screwed. Omm's going to kill me. What now? We have to fix it. Scrub it. Inside too. And the top. -Okay. -Then dry it. Eight times already. Come on, Oldie. Come on. -Not working. -Of course not. It's beyond repair. Hey. Where are you going? Wait for me. Where are we going? Just follow me. Is this a hiking trip or what? What's he doing? Climb over. Give me your hands. Which way now? That way. It's slippery here. Oh, shit. Is this really the time? I'm helping you. -What's with the smile? -Nothing. Watch out. Follow me. Don't fall again. You'll ruin their crops. Are we almost there? Karay's house is just over there. Everyone's moved out to live near the road. Except him. He's free-spirited. Karay! Are you okay? No, I can't do this! Damn it! Go clean up. I'll check the house. Karay! Karay! -No one's home? -He's probably gone to town. What do we do? I don't know. Why do you want to see this guy? He can see ghosts. Perfect for my research. You can ask me. You can see ghosts too? No. What did you see this morning? -Nothing. -And yesterday on the truck, whom did you wave to? Don't remember. I was drunk. Stubborn. If I told you, would you believe me? I've never seen a ghost. Seeing is believing. You can only see them when they want you to. They'll love a big mouth like you. Oh really? Think I'm scared? God damn it! Tough guy, it's only a rooster! Wait till you see a real ghost. Ooh, taking a dump. Where the hell did it come from? Here. Take a shower and get changed. Are you sure he wouldn't mind? No worries, Karay's a nice guy. Move over. Don't peek. What's there to see? Smart mouth. You look bright. You mean beautiful. These are kids' snacks. Come on. They're quite filling. It's not a real meal anyway. Have some of this. Do you have a signal? Yeah. Can I use it? Yes. I'M SO HAPPY TO BE WITH ALL OF YOU. Hey. -What are you doing? -Swatting a mosquito. For real? Of course, think I'd slap you? What's that? Nothing. Nothing? That's my picture. What are you doing with it? A reference for my lead character. Let me see. What's this? Your female lead is super unpleasant. I borrowed your personality, didn't change a thing. I'm deleting it. No! See? Deleted. -What's up? Need to drop a bomb? -No. That fart was quite a blast. Want some company? No. -Do you now know where the toilet is? -No. Where is it? It's nowhere. They don't use a toilet here. You dig a hole and drop your load. -So it's bursting? -Hell yes. -You're sure you can go alone? -Shut up. A hoe. A hoe. Pud! Pud! -Pud! -What happened? It's stuck? I don't understand. Hello. This is Lin. Lin, this is Karay. Girlfriend? Hot dick, eh? Always different birds. Last one had short hair. Your joke is so predictable. You're saying I'm an old fogy. -Maybe. -So where did she go just now? Oh... she went to drop her custard. Probably stepped on her own poop. Not her poop. You stepped on... Right? Where were you? We were waiting here all day. I was at the cemetery. -To pay respect to your ancestors? -To receive people's offerings. Of course not! Who would do such a thing! I got something to do there. Like all dead people do. What did you say? You're acting weird. -Because he's a... -A what? It's cold out here. Let's go inside. Come on, Lin. I'm glad you came. Hey. This way. Is your girlfriend okay? -Fire! Fire! -Just kidding. Come this way. Come, come. Follow me. This girl is wacky. I didn't know you liked weirdos. Here, here. Behave yourself. This... reminds me... of my wife. This dress. I weaved it myself. So where's your wife? Dead. Holy Buddha. It pains me to think of our last day together. How did she die? Got run over by a truck. I'll never forget what happened. That day... our four kids were sitting in our truck. We got a flat tire. So I told my wife to change it. While she was doing it, I put the gear in reverse. By accident. On purpose. Now I miss her. -By the way... -What? Don't worry about the dress. I already washed the blood off. -I'm taking it off. -No, no! You'll only make me miss her more. Pud. Ask him what you want to know, so we can go back. Back where? We'll spend the night here. What? What's wrong with you? I want to go home. Have dinner first. Natural produce. Looks good. Crickets and eels. Give me your plate. No. I'm not hungry. But you have to eat, or he can't eat. Local customs. The host has to let the guest eat first. I thought he had to burn incense first. Nonsense, he's not a ghost. Just kidding! You scared me. Hey, I have an amulet. He was teasing you. And now, to honor our folk tradition. Hmm. Cheers. Cheers. Don't insult what you don't believe. You are the perfect subject for my research. Your story is so vivid. Sure. Karay. Tell me another ghost story. How about your own story? Okay. It's a true story that happened in this village. There was a group of local kids. They ran deep into the woods. And they dared to defy a local belief: "Never whistle in the woods." Because whistling is how the spirits call out to each other. Now the children ran and ran, whistling along the way. They kept whistling until they found it. -Found what? -A mouth without a face. -A ghostly mouth whistling back. -What about the kids? All gone. Only the mouth without the face. See? This is what you get when you're disrespectful. Now I get it. Love your story. I have to write it down. Are you okay? Let me help. -Hey. -What? Your eye. Oops. What now? Let me help. Are you okay? -Karay. -What? This girl can see ghosts. -You. -What? Tell me. -Are there any ghosts here? -Yes. Really? You see them, right? Who are they? Pud. Let's go. You've got enough cases. Why are you so restless? -I have to pee. -What? -I gotta pee. -You just took a dump. Alright. I can come with you. It's alright. Let's go. We'll be right back. Don't come out again. Go on then. -I lied. -Huh? I was trying to tell you that... Karay is... Watch your mouth! Talking behind my back again. I'm not. -So beautiful. -What? What are you saying? The rice field is so beautiful. I devoted my life to it. Tomorrow. when you go to the market, tell the guy at the veggie stall near the temple... tell him, when the rice ripens, to bring people to harvest it. Then distribute the grain to all the villagers. The rice here is chemical-free. I want them to eat clean and healthy rice. Why don't you harvest it yourself? I can't. Why? I have to join my family. Oh. That's a shame. Right. It's a shame. Please do as... I've told you. He said thank you. Alright. You sleep here, Pud. She's over there. What about you? I'm good, don't worry about me. Okay. I want to sleep here. Karay. Will the ghost be offended if she sleeps here? No, it's fine. Come on. If a ghost said it's fine, then it's fine. Just go to sleep. Sweet dreams. I beg you, please stop. Karay. Lin. Karay. Karay. Karay. Karay. I'm out of here! Karay. Pud. Over here. Run. Run. -Karay... -is dead. Huh? Did you know? -Why didn't you tell me? -I tried. "Karay, long time no see. You're even funnier. Karay, I love your ghost story." Don't gloat! Let's run! Don't freak out. -Just a tree. -I think he's been dead for some time. -Can we discuss it somewhere else? -Why? You two were buddies, weren't you? Don't leave him alone. -Karay! -You're too much! Go now! This way. Wait. Hurry up. Hey. Stay close to me. Ouch. Watch out. I'm tired. Let's take a break. Thirsty? Thanks. We ran out of water. No problem. We'll find a stream. Hear that? Be careful. There it is. Be careful. Hey. -Don't move. -Why? A leech! There's one in here! Where did they come from? The whole clan! Help me! They're draining my blood! -Don’t hit me! -Stand still! On my nipple. -All gone. -Give me the stick. -Take off your top. -What? I'll get rid of them. Don't look. And how can I get them off? I'll do it myself. Hey. More leeches in the water. Shit! Hey. Where are you going? Fucking leeches. They're still on me! Still! Stupid branches! Take your bag. Wait for me. Be careful. Pud! I can't go on. Are you hurt? I'm hungry. Oh. What the... Okay. I'll help. Bend down. One... two, three. Grab the branch. I'm falling! Hold on. Lin. Lin. My legs! My legs. Again. One, two, three. Shit. Lin. You're such a wimp. And you're damn heavy. Try again. Look, that's a whole lot easier. That one's not tasty. This one's the best. But they're riper. You're not supposed to eat them ripe. They're too soggy. This is better. Yummy. You've got juice all over your mouth. This is what we fought so hard for. Leave those bananas for wild animals. Well... we've covered a great distance today. I could be a marathon runner. You're pretty tough. Well... Sorry for putting you in danger. It's fine. I had fun. Wanna run some more? Just kidding. Lin. Lin. It's dark already. No way I'm spending the night here. Let's get out of here. This way. Someone's coming. What are you doing? Someone's whistling. Don't you remember? The whistle story? -Karay's story. -Never whistle in the woods because that's how spirits call out to each other. Why can't you leave me alone, Karay? Go, Lin. Running again! Not this way. Watch out! Be careful. I think it's this way. Why are you running? Is that a ghost? What ghost? Why are you running away? You whistled, so I whistled back. I thought you needed help. He's not a ghost. But what are you doing here? Picking bamboo shoots. The main road is that way. I'm going home. Mom's waiting. Thank you. Thank you. Take care, kiddo. You're welcome. Wait up, Boonrod. You know Karay, right? Yes. Tell the village chief to go to Karay's house tomorrow. Don't forget, okay? Okay. Let's go, Lin. Yeah. Lin. A car's coming. Look, a shooting star. Whoa, I just missed it. Thank you. Thank you so much. Pud! Where the hell have you been? Everyone's worried sick. They went out looking for you. I know you can manage on your own. But why did you bring the girl along? Look at the state you're in. Been to hell or something? We had a little adventure. I'll tell the story when they come back. Probably not tonight. They've stopped looking for you and gone out to watch the stars instead. -Thought they were worried sick. -I have to go. To see the stars? -No, to watch a Korean series. -Oh. -Bye. -Yep. You go this way. Oh, right. Bye. This one is so realistic, Ann. And if you knew how I came up with the plot, you'd be shocked. Yeah, sure. Whistling ghosts, seriously? Give me something more realistic and send it by this weekend! Okay, Ann. Shit! It's me. What's up? Can I use your phone? I want to call my mom. My phone has no reception. Sure. Thank you. Hi, Mom. No need to yell at me. I'm in Chiangmai. Don't sit on it! What? Moisturizing facial cream with natural extracts. Your beauty secret. Your lead girl is a beauty blogger? No. So what's this? I wrote it. Wow, I've been hanging out with a beauty blogger! That's my main source of income. Hey sis, my skin is so dry. Do you have any recommendations? Hmm. With that face, I recommend you cut your head off. That's not nice. Put it down. Listen, sis. This is the best. It's a new medical serum. A solution for all skin problems. Just one drop on your ring finger. It helps tighten your pores and reduces the appearance of dark spots. My special treatment just for you. -Did you wash your hands? -No. -I'll poke around. -Huh. Whoa! You've got lots of movies here. This one is ancient. I like it. Very funny. An indie movie? Never heard of it? Hmm. Maybe I saw the poster at an art house cinema. Yeah, it looks familiar. -Did you write the script? -How did you know? From your big smile. Yeah, I wrote it. The director's name is so big. The scriptwriter's name is very tiny. You need a microscope to find it. A magnifying glass will do. I heard the director is pretty. May I? Sure. And this. -To keep you warm. -Here we go again. Why not? So, since when? -Since when what? -Could you see what you see? Since I was born. Oh. It must be tough for you. Why are you smiling? No reason. Nobody's ever said that to me. They usually think I'm weird. Because they don't see what you see. And... when you see ghosts, why do you put your hand up like this? I feel safe when I touch my amulet. But I forgot to bring it. So it's just my instinct. I see. Music? Why do we have to come out through the window? It's faster. Hey. What song are you looking for? Let me find it. You wouldn't know it. Look, Pud. The sky is full of stars. Wonderful, isn't it? This is so nice. STOP WORKING, WHEN CAN WE HAVE DINNER? I’M NOT LONELY IN THE MOUNTAIN BECAUSE OF THIS HOT GUY! So heavy. Did you sleep well? Uh-huh. -You tossed and turned in your sleep. -Me? Time for breakfast. Wait. If we show up at the same time, will they get the wrong idea? Of course, they will. And you, do you have that idea? Omm. We have to pay the utility bills. They're higher than last month when we have fewer guests. Hi, there. Where were you? -Miss me? -A little. So? What's up? -Long story. -Long story? Spare me. I don't want to hear. Okay. Aom, come here. Where was Omm last night? He didn't come to watch the stars with us. He probably spent the night in Pai. I think he has a chick there. I can hear you. Omm, you can talk to me about anything. Oh yeah! My Oldie. Where is it? Oh. Don't oh me, you two. -It'll come back soon. -All by itself? Don't worry. I'll make sure it will. But can I borrow Youngster today? -I want to take my guest for a ride. -Who's your guest? Here. My oh my, Pud. Got your heartbreak fixed? A guest, come on! He got dumped for sure. A hundred percent is sure. Forget him. How about these two? Do you guy like each other? A hundred and ten percent sure. Come on. Welcome to my office. I'm jealous. Everyone is. Tell me about the script you're working on. It's a brand-new genre of film. See, there's a couple who's been in love for a long time. -But love always comes with obstacles. -I guess. One day, the man discovers that his girl removes her head from her body at night. Then her head floats around and feeds on chicken intestines. Sometimes she even feasts on human feces. Now I'm getting hungry. Crazy. How about this story? It's really unheard of. There are a guy and a girl, sitting by a pond in the woods. They're enjoying their conversation so much that they have no idea there's a woman eavesdropping. But the woman can't hear a thing. So she moves closer and closer. Now she's standing right behind the guy. Her face almost touches his. -That's enough. -Sounds so real. -Hey. -Scary. Wait for me. Hey, sit tight. The air's so fresh! Yeah, it's really fresh!

What's this? I'll tell you. It wasn't here before. It's called A Memorial of the Romantic Wreck. It's just trash, really. Last month someone left behind a couple of toothbrushes. So Omm imagined a sob story about them. Like, they're relics of lost love. Since then he's been telling the guests to leave some personal objects behind. Interesting. You think it's nonsense. Feel free to stay somewhere else. Aww, don't be hurt. Where's everybody? Everybody who? Yeah, who do you mean? Let's get our stuff. Do we have to carry all this? -Take this. -Okay. Yes, ma'am. Under the shadow of the stars There’s only us Omm. Need help? Whoa, you're wearing this dress? You know what it means, right? Only virgins are allowed to wear it. Who said I'm not? Omm, it's been too long. I don't want to wear this dress anymore. Alright, Aom. Come here. -Omm. -Before I change my mind. Get inside. Omm. I'll be waiting here! Hey. Vittaya!

Traffic, you know. What traffic? We're on a mountain. I'll call him again right now. No answer. It's okay. You're alright? -Sure. -Good. What did you throw? My necklace. Why? It's handmade and hard to find. Sure. Hard to find when it's down there. Too bad, it's a powerful amulet. Not as powerful as me. Agreed. Yes, it is. Let's get out of here. Carpets of stars roll over the night sky Shining so bright inside my mind Hurry up, Noon. We're out of here. So lonely inside Wish you were here by my side Oh, shit. Together we could watch the stars So bright Oh, how I've missed you You brought bad luck! The rain came with you. It's rainy season! Can't stop thinking of you Your face's stayed with me Since that first day Why did you come here? If I want to understand ghost-seers, I have to be where the ghosts are. I guess so. -Here. -What is it? An appetizer fit for our first date. Grilled tree frogs. -Where did you get them? -Right in front. Caught them as they were hopping about. Maybe you've stayed here too long. -I have salty grilled bats too. -I don't want any. -You don't? -No. Pud! That's my house. Now I can't even go in there. You... You bastard, Pud! I'll come and spook you. BASED ON A (ALMOST) TRUE STORY You missed the cushion! I almost flipped over! Like this? Right. I'll jump first if something happens. Sure. I'll make sure she's safe! Shit!

I almost got killed the other day. -But you're dead. -What did you say? This girl is something! Say it out loud. Loud and clear, girl! Look on the bright side, if we hadn't run away from leeches and ghosts, we wouldn't have found the banana trees. Sorry! No! You sat on it. One more time. Sorry, I wasn't looking! This one is powerful. You won't have to be scared of ghosts anymore. ...scared of ghosts.
