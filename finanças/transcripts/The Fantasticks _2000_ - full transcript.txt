(ROOSTER CROWS) (MUSIC PLAYING) Luisa. Luisa, are you coming down soon? "Kiss number 60. "The kiss upon the eyes. "The eyelid kiss is said to produce "a unique sensation of an unworldly nature, "running from the base of the spine to the knees." BELLOMY: Luisa. What you been doing up there, dear? Studying. Well, that's good. What's that for? Number 26. Kissing a parent. Where are you going? Town. Before you go, would you do your dad a favor and come over here a second, let me see how this fits? I always look like a sick turkey. Ah. (GROANS) The neckline is too high. Be careful... Where did you get that? That's your mother's necklace. I found it in a box of old letters. You gave it to her, didn't you? I can't believe you were ever that romantic. Ha! Did you stand outside her window and serenade her with love songs too? Mmm. (GARGLING) I guess not. There are other things in the world as important as love songs, you know. Like what? Like work songs, that's like what. Like hymns, anthems, marches. Dirges. Never mind. (SIGHS) Papa, I've got to take wing. Be careful, it's duck season. I don't suppose your wings are going to carry you anywhere near that carnival, are they? What carnival? Luisa. You look nice in the necklace. (HAMMERING) Hi, Mr. Hucklebee. (MOUTHING WORDS) Luisa? How many times, since they moved in, have I told you not to talk to that idiot next door? Couple of hundred. A couple of hundred times you told me not to talk to his son either. Good for me.

Keep your crud on your own side! You keep your face and your damn bricks out of my side! Or you'll be wearing brick earmuffs. Thief! Murderer! Lunkhead! Fuzz bucket! He's out of his mind with love, that son of mine. Nothing sets the heart a flutter, like a good old fashion feud. What do you think will happen when they meet on that road to the carnival? I don't know. But they'll never suspect we planned it. That son of mine, he's fantastic. My daughter is fantastic too. Just think if they knew that we wanted them wed. A pre-arranged marriage?

Kids. Won't it be nice, when our kids are married so they can drive each other crazy, instead of us? Right. They're nearly there. There just one thing missing for our hero and heroine, a climax. You watch what you say, you are talking about my daughter. And speaking in theatrical terms we have to find some way to end the feud without them knowing we made the whole thing up. Well, how do you propose we do that? That's the problem. Wait a minute. You see? Whenever you got a problem the United States Postal Service comes to the rescue. Yeah, they run a tight shift. Let's go, Bellomy. Let's have a talk with this fellow... Are you crazy? We can't go to the carnival, the kids will see us, they'll think we're looking for them. Instant heat. I seem to remember that's good for romance. Isn't it? Uh-huh. Uh-ah! Fuel to the fire. "Specialists in dreams come true." "Family feud settled." What are we waiting for? (PEOPLE TALKING INDISTINCTLY) (PIANO MUSIC PLAYING) Romeo, Romeo! Wherefore art thou, Romeo? MATT: But soft. What light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.

It's a century till moonlight. I'll never wash this hand again. What the devil... At your service. Wait, you the famous El Gallo? El Gallo. Oh, yeah. See, we got your advertisement in the mail and we got ourselves a little problem. A love problem. You two have a love problem? And you seek sympathy from our little band of outcasts. What would you two be willing to do in front of an audience? No, wait a minute... We are not talking about us. We're talking about our kids. Who happen to be a boy and a girl. Less challenging. Follow me. Although we are not yet fully prepared the official opening of the entire carnival, I think we can proceed with our business here. One moment, I'll check my files. I'm sorry, what did you say your names were? Hucklebee. Bellomy. I do beg your pardon, this is "N" through "Z." Yes, there we are, "A" through "M." Oh! How did you do that? It wasn't easy it took months to set up these files. Oh my... (WHISPERING) Quiet. I'm beginning to get a picture. You said you had a daughter? Yes. I see a girl. Is her name Luisa? Is that your daughter's name. Yes. That's her. Oh, look. She is standing next to a young man who must be, who must be... Quick, before the image fades. Matt. That's it. You're amazing. They seem to be happy enough. What about the feud? Of course that's there, I said "seem." Obviously your children are feeling a great deal of torment. Uncanny. And you've come to me for some kind of magic, eh? You're in luck. Ooh! Frankly, we came to you to find out how to end this feud. Many paths lead to the summit. Follow me. You know, we kind of thought it'd be a good idea if my mild-mannered son was turned into a rip-roaring hero. Really? Well, yes, that would be the first thought of a common rural mind. And by an amazing coincidence, it's also mine. Ah! Boy, are we lucky. Of course to have a hero, you must first have a villain. That makes sense. But who? Let's think, the young lady knows both of you, so that wouldn't work. What about you? Me? Oh, I couldn't do it, for free. But for a small donation to my favorite charity... Yeah. Yeah. (BOTH CHUCKLING) Would $60 be an insult? Yes, but I'm used to abuse. Oh, yes. I see it, I start to kidnap his daughter, your son runs in to save her. Then a battle. I allow the boy to defeat me, your son becomes a hero, the parents relent, the feud is over forever. She melts into his arms. How much for such a drama? That, senor, depends. Depends on what? On what else. The quality of the rape. Rape? No! No rape! Oh, very well then, the abduction. The rape, the chase, the kidnapping. Call it what you will, from the Latin rapere.

First class it is. Now, let's see. What else should we use? Do you want Jo-Jo the Chicken Lady? I don't think so. I know, the Bavarian baby. I've got one who is very talented, he can swallow a sword. If you throw in $4 extra he cleans up after himself. What about that act? Which? "Shakespearian company, direct from London. "Theatre Royal, Drury Lane." No. No, you don't want that. Now, instead... I think Shakespeare is a great idea. After all, my son thinks he is Romeo. My daughter would be a perfect Juliet. Really, gentlemen, I assure you it's not a good idea. Now, for a first class abduction... Let me see. BELLOMY: But Shakespeare, that's real class. I was in a Shakespeare play once. HUCKLEBEE: Really? Uh-huh. My daughter would like Shakespeare. So would my son. Likes that I am the Pantomime whatever. And with Shakespeare, it's sure to be done in good taste. Sir, the players have arrived. Thank you. But your services will not be necessary. Now or ever. Back in the trunk. These men are from London? Straight from Theatre Royal, Drury Lane? Absolutely, one long, straight ride. Down. Don't see us as we are. Gentlemen, please. Remove ten pounds of road dust from these aged wrinkled cheeks. See make-up caked in glowing powder pink. Imagine a beard, full-blown and glowing like the whiskers of a bear. Imagine hair in a box, I have all colors. Please, I beg of you, imagine hair. And not these clothes, dear God, no, no. Not rags like every beggar has. But see me in a doublet. Mortimer, fetch the doublet. Thank you. EL GALLO: Gentlemen, if you insist on Shakespeare, my advice is, don't over-rehearse. Say a cue, you'll see, I'll know it. Go on, try me. Friends, Romans, countrymen. Is what? Friends, Romans, countrymen. No, no, no. Don't tell me, I'll get it. You'll see. Oh, yes, of course, of course. Why, that's easy. Why didn't you pick a hard one? Now, here, watch this. Friends, Romans, countrymen. Screw your courage to that sticking place. And be not sick. And pale with reef. For thou are handmaidens. But far more fair than she. Is. How was that? Do you think he can do it? The chicken lady is cheaper and you get to keep the eggs. I got faith in the bard, let's sign him on. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Allow me to introduce myself. I am Henry Albertson. BELLOMY: And who is that? HENRY: That's Mortimer. He has been with me all his life. He does death scenes. Would you like to see one? He's an expert. Mortimer, die for the gentlemen. (CHOKING) (GROANS) And that's the short version. The Indian is out of the question. Besides, I think he is dead. Oh. Too bad, 'cause they're a team. Inseparable. So what could we use instead? How about Siamese twins. Two for the price of one. Nah, we're gonna stick with Shakespeare. Yeah. It'll be a lifelong memory for the children. Lifelong memory it is. Still not sure about the Indian. Gentlemen, we must hurry. We have an abduction to stage. This very night. Here, you two had better go home and rehearse your parts. Parts? We're not actors. This is too much to memorize. Not actors, you say. Very well then.

After all, you can't run away and stay at home at the same time. Well, who cares if we never see this one goat town again. We can drop by in five or six years to see if your father is still alive. What? The world is waiting. I wonder if Matt... Matt? Never mind. All right, go. Get ready. See if you can borrow a little money while you're about it. Kiss me first. No matter what happens, I'll never, ever forget that kiss. A unique sensation of an unworldly nature running from the base of the spine to the knees. (LAUGHS) Wait. Give me a trinket to pledge that you'll come back. That necklace. It was my mother's. Good. It will service your pledge. I will leave you my mother's necklace because it is my favorite thing. Guard it. And I'll go pack. I won't be long. You're really taking me with you? Would I lie? I won't be long. You will be here? I promise. All right, move it out. (EXHALES DEEPLY) (EXHALES SHARPLY) Ah, the prodigal son comes out from his trip around the world. Allow me to say, you look much wiser but less well groomed. Leave me alone. Fine, I'm in a bit of a rush, anyway. Where did you get that? Oh, this? It's just a souvenir. It's Luisa's. You stole it. Please, she gave it to me. Not that it's any business of yours. Now, as I said. (GRUNTS) (GROANS) All right. Move it out. El Gallo. El Gallo! El Gallo? El Gallo! (SOBBING) EL GALLO: There is a curious paradox that no one can explain. Who understands the secret of the reaping of the grain. Who understands why spring is born out of winter's laboring pain. Or why we all must die a bit before we grow again. Matt. What happened? You look awful. It isn't worth tears, Luisa, please. Did you find the money and the beautiful women. I can't remember, I... I was drugged or hypnotized or something. There was this funny light and mirrors. I know. And there was this music. Strange music and people turning and spinning and... Wearing masks. I remember crying out. But no one came to help you. I'm sorry, Matt. No, I... It's all right. I deserved it. I've been foolish. I have, too.
