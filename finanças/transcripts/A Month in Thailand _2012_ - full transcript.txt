With the support of Written by A Month in Thailand Did you find it? Yea, it was in my pants. We have to buy a bottle of wine, too. Like from last time. I'm gonna be a while. I'll take a shower, then take as much as you want. What's up? Not much. At home. No... OK, so Mega it is. Come on, it's too far and too crowded. You wanna shop for a whole year? OK. OK, at a quarter to, then. I'll shower, then I'm coming over. No, it's fine, don't worry about it. OK. Bye, bye. What did he want? Alex. Wanted to go to Cora. If you're gonna go, will you get an after-shave, or something? An after-shave? Yea, I know he needs it. Don't you wanna get something more special? - Doesn't he have any hobbies? - I know him. That's what I always got him. Whatever you say. If it's no use to him, he doesn't like it. It's how he is. I got you something, too. What's the occasion? 31st... 9 months since we've been together. Oh, yea. Thanks. - I didn't get you anything. - Doesn't matter. It's for the both of us. You like it? I like it. I love you, guy. I love you, too. That's enough. Mick! I have to take the dog out. - I can manage. - Let me help. I'm not crippled, you know. OK, suit yourself. We have to go to my place, to get changed. OK. Anca's not back yet, is she? She gets back on the fourth. No, no! Get down, you can't do that! Mick, no! You can't! Down boy! Here! Here! Sorry. Come on! Home! Bad dog! It's gonna be cool. The place is good. Yea. After that we can go and get hammered, like good people? Obviously. I gotta see about Adina. Make it up to her. Why? You get into a fight? On the contrary. She spoils me. Over here. Get her a pig. - What? - Yea, a pig. Guinea pig? No, pig-pig. I know someone who got one. No joke. Alive? Yea, a normal sty pig. It's clean, and all that. And next year you can eat it. Yea... I was thinking about a trip to Thailand. Or Thailand, that's what I meant. What's this about Thailand? Just like that. It's cool. Yea, it is. You're too good for the commoners now? Busteni, Poiana Tapului... An all-inclusive at Geoagiu Bai... Plane ticket's the expensive part. About 1000 euros. But, over there you can live for a month in one of those beach homes for 100 euro. Cheap food... I heard the women are cheap too. - Dude, where are the almonds? - What? I have to get my mom some unroasted almonds. That way. We passed it. Near the sweets. Hold on. Take care of this. Where'd you disappear? Here... Here where? I was looking. Someone could've gone off with this. - Who the hell would steal your plant? - I dunno. Plant thieves. They smoke 'em afterward. I don't know what to get. I dunno, but get something. Look at the line! How can you get an after-shave as a present for someone? It's ridiculous. Ready. Stay here! What? Thanks. For? For the present, and for coming with me. Yes? Yes, mom, it's us. Hello. Happy new year! Happy new year, cheers! Come on, the meat's getting cold. Sorry, we went to Cora, it was crowded. What do we have here? Just break the wrapping. And tear such a nice wrapping? It was Radu's idea, so you know. Thanks. Thanks, children. Leana, wanna get crushed at backgammon? I though you played chess, not backgammon. When Doru comes over. But I'm an ace at backgammon. Hadn't had time for it, but, in my time, I beat the best of 'em. Come, come on in, take a seat. We haven't decided yet. We might be tired after the restaurant. We went to Caciulata once, for New Year's. You remember? In those times, it was a big deal to reserve something for the holidays. We're going to Thailand in March. A present from Radu. What's gotten into you? Why? We'll go on holiday. Why all the way to Thailand? She means "careful with your lives there". Forget it, nothing's gonna happen. Let the children go. It's far away and dangerous. Why don't you go to Greece or Turkey? It's not. A lot of people go. So why do I only hear about disease and starvation... That's not their problem. It's a happening destination now. It's very beautiful there. - Isn't it expensive? - On the contrary. Cheaper than the local attractions. The plane ticket's expensive. About 1000 euros. - Even if you buy in advance? - Doesn't matter. I'm getting another one... You can get it 2 days in advance, same thing. They have an offer now... - That's good, thank you. - Come on, eat. - Here you go. - Thanks. I'm surprised Adina wants to go to such an exotic place. She didn't want to go to Singapore, let alone... What do you mean? Temasek, Tomasek, that Polytechnic of theirs... They accepted her for a Master's. A professor advised her. He told her to apply, she was a good student, had good grades. - It was simply a grant. - Yes, a 5 month grant. They accepted her. - What was it, 2, 3 year ago? - 4. She'd've had everything. A house, meals, money. Hundreds... thousands of dollars per month. - Millions. - Whatever. The dollars they have there. Just to go there and study. - So? - So, she didn't go. Someone else got to to. "What do I need an international diploma for?" - The South Pole was the next stop. - They had some accommodations... Pools, volleyball courts,... tennis courts, the chance to travel and learn. I wasn't gonna go tramping about who knows where. It was not just a professional opportunity. She'd've seen the world, how other people live. Like I'm dying to see how the Chinese or whatever live. I told her she'd miss out, but... Adina... She's into concrete things, not trifles. As long as she doesn't regret it. She must want it, not us. We like to have her close to us. - Have some more peas. - No, thank you! A little bit. There we go. No, thanks. I always forget I locked twice. It'll just be a second. Are you getting changed here? I'll take the clothes to your place. What's the use? We're wasting time. Weren't we staying here? Oh, we're staying here? I'll get changed then, it's gonna take a bit. Did you hear about Smara? No. What? She broke up with Vivi and hooked up with her brother. - No way! I don't believe it. - Really. Wasn't her brother with that, what's her name? I thought so too, but he's not, apparently. Are they coming together tonight? No. Maybe they're ashamed. - So how are they getting along? - Don't know. I'm curious too. - What did you get? - A little cupboard. I got it for us. To keep my clothes in, when I come over. I brought it when you were in Sibiu. With all the Christmas stuff, I forgot. What about mine? There's no room to throw a pin in your cupboard. But it's not like you have that many clothes. That's exactly why not. I don't have a place to leave them. Gotta decide where to put it... I don't know where it could fit. It fits near the desk. I measured. Cool. We'll take it tomorrow, when we leave. Bring me the eye shadow from my purse, please. Better yet, just bring me the purse. You know... - About what you dad said, the scholarship. - What about it? Why didn't you go? It didn't enthrall me, that's all. How so? It just didn't seem so important to me to go to Singapore. Why do you ask? No reason. You were with Robert back then, right? Does it matter? Couldn't you both apply for the same grant? Yea, but he found something here, and didn't wanna go. That's why you didn't go? Not just that. I'd've gone by myself if I were you. Yea, I'm sure. Meaning? You could've gone by yourself. Not me. - You didn't wanna leave Robert by himself. - Yea, fine. It was that, too. I don't see the purpose of this discussion. So that's what it really was. I don't know if it was that. There's no point talking about something from ages ago. Still, why was leaving him home so bad? It was just 5 months. Who knows what he'd've done, left alone for 5 months. What would he have done, alone for 5 months? I can imagine what. Thanks. That doesn't stop you from having them. You won't spend your life in that 2 room apartment. You have to plan. I have all sorts. Just wait 2-3 years. Raluca will start up, and you'll see. No, I won't. You're starting to irritate me. My grandma has a house in Rahova. It's a shack, but the land's valuable, and the area's growing. And how much from there to downtown? Let him tell you. Depends on the traffic. It's not that long. Take T. Vladimirescu, then 13 Septembrie. - Without traffic, you can be 5 minutes. - And with? Then you stay home. Get a pool, and hang around all day. You're gonna build a pool in Rahova? There's room for a small one. - You'd say no to a pool in the summer? - Like that's all I needed. If you don't mind the neighbors seeing your ass in the yard. Just build a tall fence, and no one will see you. This is like the jerks moving to Popesti-Leordeni, to live in a mansion. And have a nice view of the cornfield. Not like they have much to see. Big problem. If you don't mind living like in a prison. You can even put up some nice pink barbed wire. Hey! What's wrong? - Girl! - Call an ambulance! - Someone passed out. - Are you alright? Come fast! - Is there a pulse? Is she breathing? - She's coming to. - It's probably an epileptic seizure. - Bite her finger. No, she'll be fine. You can't do anything. She'll come around. My friend's calling now. Easy... - Oh God! - Hurry up! Come on, wake up! Don't be scared. You smoked. Just one cigarette. Are you OK? Yes. You? 15, 14,... 13, 12,... 11, 10,... 9, 8, 7,... 6, 5, 4,... 3, 2, 1,... Happy New Year! Happy New Year! I love you! Nadia! Alex and Raluca asked if we were joining them. You want to? Do you? You know I'm not thrilled about that. I was just thinking it's New Year's, and we should celebrate. And you can't do that with me? Of course. Don't start. You can go. I'm going home. Please, don't start. Then let's have a good time together. We'd be together at the party, too. - Everything OK? - Yes. Have some of this, it's great. - It's got celery. - Thanks. I can't enjoy myself in a place where I'm not comfortable. You don't even know where it is. You won't know if you don't even try. Is it so bad that I wanna spend time with you, and not in some club? - OK, but you don't even wanna try. - There is nothing to try. I want to enjoy this time just with you, am I asking too much? No. - We could make it... our night. - If you don't like it... You won't regret it. No. You sure? Super. What are you doing here all alone? I just went out for a bit. You said you weren't drinking. I'm leaving the car here. Come on, you know how hard it is to get a cab at this hour? We'll find one. What's wrong? Nothing. What? I say something I shouldn't? Come on, I can tell you're upset. I'm sorry if I upset you. - If you want, let's go to the party. - We're not going to any party. I don't want to continue like this. What do you mean? I mean there's no point in us staying together. It's not enough for... ...us to stay together. What do you mean? You're wrong. There's plenty between us. I love you. We have no reason to break up, what's gotten into you? We love each other, but you don't realize. It would be foolish to break up. I'm sorry. I care for you, but... I don't think it's enough. I didn't want it to happen like this. Not here, and not now. You have no reason to want this. - I gave you all, I did everything for you. - It's not about that. Then what? About nothing in particular. Just that... I think it's best for both of us. I know there hasn't been enough time, but you'll see. You'll realize we're made for each other. Don't ruin it now. Give me another chance. Did I do something wrong? Tell me! Did I? I said something I shouldn't have? Then why? And why today? Please, Radu, think it over. Don't ruin everything! There's nothing to think about. I told you... I care about you... In a way... ...yes, I love you. I thought we were right for each other, but... ...I don't think I still feel what... ...I used to. It's more fair this way. Fair?! This is what you call fair?! Did that retard call you? She wants you to fuck her? - Calm down, no one called. - I saw you look when that guy yelled. You think I'm stupid? - I didn't look. - Who are you fucking? - No one. - No one... You don't wanna fuck her, but you want to break up, you motherfucker! You should be ashamed, you asshole! Are you OK? Hello. Can you go with Adina to the bathroom? I'm not going to any bathroom! Get the hell out of my life and leave me alone! I don't wanna see or hear from you! What's with the face? Give us a moment, we're busy. OK, bro. Where's Toma? - I don't know, bro, go look. - You're such a hater. There's Frost! Ducu wants you to come, too. I get you, really, but cut it out. It's New Year's. Yea... I mean, it's no like... ...I don't care about her, or... Just that... I don't know. You could've waited a day or two, and not fuck up her year from the start. Yea, I know. It was an impulse. She was pissed at me, too. - Yea? - Yea. When outside, I looked over when someone called out to a Nadia. She saw me looking. - Was it Nadia? - Obviously not. I kept saying things would change by themselves. It's not like it's perfect between me and Raluca, but you have to bend at times. You do, obviously. You want a lady in the streets, a perfect cook, and a freak in the bed. No use. She doesn't exist. I know, but... I was hoping for one more... ..."chill", I dunno. That doesn't consider every little thing 1000 times. You know best. Come on! We'll go to the party, and it'll be fine. Yea... I don't... I'm not in the mood. Jesus!... You know it? With that guy who wins the slot machine. We won't fit in a single cab. We'll take this one, and the losers take the next. Ducu, you come with us. It was one of those old Dacias, no ABS or anything. I hit the brake and the hood stood up. They're backwards on the old Dacias. The hinge is in the front, and I opened it to let the air in. So the hood went over. I mean, the car stopped, it didn't. Ripped his windshield to shreds. A new Dacia. Convertible. - Who's that? - I don't know her. Stop it! Your folks cleaned you out, huh? Rise and shine! I was thinking about Ducu's hood. - Should I go up that street? - Just leave us at the roundabout. Roundabout, roundabout... How is it? - Fine, you? - Fine, too. All alone? Where's Adina? Yes. How so? You broke up... Kind of. I'm very sorry. But maybe it's for the best, no? What do you say? Don't be sad. Do you mind? If you mind, tell me, and I'll get up. How much longer do I keep rubbing against you, for you to notice me? We're not doing anything. I know, but... ...now is not the time. I'm sorry. What's up? That's it. I'm going. Don't be a wanker. No use. I'm not in the mood. "The night is still young!" Yea, I know. I'm fed up, and I'm going home. Come on, it won't be much longer. The crowd's breaking up. What? Still thinking about Adina? So what? You made a decision. Yea... It's strange. Hearing her name just then. - Who's? - Nadia. Someone called her at midnight. I told you. Yea, but, there must be other Nadias in the world. Nadia Comaneci, for example. I thought I saw her at Cora. No shit?! Nadia Comaneci? Maybe it was Nadia Comaneci. Could've got me an autograph. I tried to call her. Her phone was off. I'm sure. Maybe she's sleeping, all the way in America. Actually, no. Still early there. She's getting dressed for New Year's. You realize it's still last year there? - Forget it. - OK, sorry. Tell me about Nadia. I thought I saw her at Cora. I thought maybe it's a sign. Of what? That, I don't know, maybe... ...I shouldn't have given up on her. Her who? Nadia or Adina? Nadia! I called, and her phone was off. What can you do? We'll go to The Ark. Take your mind of this crap about signs. I have to get through to her. Get through how? Tonight? What did you take? I'm asking because I want some. You're something else. She won't answer anyway. I'll see you. Excuse me! Take me to Cosbuc instead, please. The flower market. Actually, no. Strike that. To Popa Nan. Sorry. Can I go in and look for someone? You have to pay. - How much? - 100. 5 minutes. I won't stay in. - Have you seen Nadia? - Who? Nadia! Don't think she's here. I would've seen her. Everything OK? Happy New Year! Radu! - What's up? - Having a smoke. You? - Changed your mind? - Yea. Didn't want to be alone on New Year's. They say how you spend this night will show your whole year. Exactly. - Alex, Raluca? - They're downstairs. We're coming too. Why don't you answer your phone? I called. Raluca was around, too. With Miruna. They went to the bathroom. I can't find them. Hi. It's Radu. Happy New Year to you too! At The Ark. I know. Alex told me. I didn't catch you. Hey, is Nadia with you? Can you put her on, please? Her phone's turned off. Yes. No. Would you mind letting her decide that? I think it's her business if she wants to or not. Do you feel well? - We're going to "The Factory". - There's a lot of us though. We need... how many of us are there? 4, 6, 9... Stop laughing! So, 3 in a car. Are you coming? Don't start again. You said it's New Year's, and you wanna party. OK, I'm coming. Atta boy. So, what's the deal? No deal. So, what's with you? I blew it. Yea, but... - You yourself said you didn't love her anymore. - No, with Nadia. I blew off the only girl I was OK with. Piss off! I called Miruna and she hung up on me. I really have to get in touch with her. Are you kidding me? Man, I understand, really. But think about it: maybe she's with someone. Why now? Not like you're getting married today. I don't know. That's what I feel. Give it a rest. Mark my words: I'll give you Nadia tomorrow. I'll take her and bring her to you. But just forget her for a few hours and enjoy yourself. You're incredible. Break it off with one, get back with the other. All in one night. Like a soap. I don't think so. Come on, are we going? We're gonna walk. Come on, friends! On Mythbusters... - They re-did the whole film-set. - Give me a break. All these shows, on Discovery et al, are just propaganda. Yes, they're... ..."The right arm of the Party". Give me a break. I only see counter-arguments. There was no moon landing, that I can guarantee you. It was all scripted. So, it was... It was made in a studio, right? Yea, they got Kubrick. So that means that Kubrick was an awful director if he allowed all that shit to slip through. He made mistakes, so... And then he died mysteriously. Dude, here's the best argument, you think... - I spoke to her earlier on the phone. - And? She didn't say much. You can imagine. Crying, not feeling well. I told her I wanted to drop by. She told me no, she wanted to be alone. Sagittarius. Some combination. Not that it's bad, but... weird. - You know about ascendants? - No. I wanted to ask. They say that, after 30 years, the ascendant becomes more important than the sign you're born under. I mean... ...you're influenced more by... ...Capricorn. It's somewhat backwards. - How do Sagittariuses get along with Virgos? - Virgos? I don't know it by heart, but I can tell you these are very different signs, too. Sagittariuses are... - Hi. - Hi. This is how you party on New Year's? Yea. ...that's the difference... Emilia. - Radu. Pleasure. - A pleasure. I'm Cristina. I'm such a cow. I forgot to introduce you. They're my colleagues. Well,... they're my friends. It's so cold! And Virgos? - Where are you taking us, beast? - To the beach in Vama Veche. Be careful, it's slippery. - This song's stuck in my head. - Can I have a cigarette? - What are you doing? - Hold on! Are you serious? They're fucking! - Where? - There, at the window. Oh, yea! There're people fucking at the window. Are you crazy, there's 3 of them! There's two chicks! A man who can party on New Year's. What's that supposed to mean? You know what I mean. We all know what you mean. Tell it to Raluca, too. Keep trying, maybe you'll succeed. It's all your fault. You aligned your chakras so they'd turn off the light. Why do you all wanna have it with two girls? - No man wants it the other way. - You ask too many questions. Men want women to sacrifice themselves, because they're selfish. Where's women's emancipation, then? Raluca, if you ever break up with Alex, I'm willing to sacrifice myself. Actually, you don't have to break up. I like his soft white skin. Ducu? Hold on, I forgot... I wanna say that I don't think she knew all these things then. So, she acted as she thought best. She was in love. Yes, but, someone in love must think of the consequences, too, no? Her parents, for example. From what you're saying, it would mean that one who loves should sacrifice himself for the other. What I mean is if she did all this stuff for this guy, she probably did it out of love. And it probably wasn't easy. Yes. Not too complicated. She let herself be fooled is all. I don't think so. She could've had an abortion, but didn't. She didn't, because she loved him. It's obvious it was much harder for her to keep the baby and raise it alone. If she'd let herself be carried away, like you say, she would've aborted. It's like saying that... all the women who ever love should sacrifice themselves like... ...fools, for men. Yes, but this goes both ways. It happens to men, too. This whole love thing, it's like crap in your brain that doesn't let you think. What matters in a relationship is respect, and getting along with them. I don't know if that's true. In my opinion, love doesn't happen daily, so you shouldn't be losing your mind every which way. Yea but, you wanna tell me that, if you fall in love tomorrow and he says "Let's go to Patagonia", you just go because of love? Not necessarily. It depends. If I really love him, and it's mutual, sure. In fact, I did do this. - What do you mean? - I mean, this happened. Or... something of the sort. When I lived in Berlin,... I met a Spanish guy, and, when he had to return to Spain, I left everything. I dropped school and everything and went with him. I wouldn't have thought I could do this. - When did you go to Spain? - Last summer, to Barcelona. I had no idea. How long? Not long, 2-3 months. Things went bad pretty quickly. Rather, he got bored pretty quickly, and I became a burden suddenly. - At least you didn't get pregnant. - No, thank God! Not that it couldn't happen. She's crazy, I'm not surprised anymore. In love, more like, otherwise I have all my marbles. Seriously... I never did this before, and I didn't think I could. Why did it go bad so quick? No reason... First, the guy was kind of special, he was a sort of - ...Buddhist monk, he'd go to monasteries... - Hold on, what do you mean? In Berlin,... I was friends with other artists who were squatting. That?s where I met him. Anyway. In Spain, we'd live where we could. His friends, his family. Once, we stayed in a monastery. You went there while having nowhere to live? Not only that,... ..but I spent all my Erasmus money. I went there through them. So I was broke. We went out every night, and I had to return alone more than once, because... -...he would find some girl. - No way! - And you gathered your toys and left. - Not really. At first, I said... "OK, I don't care." "He wants to keep things open. Fine." "I will try and understand him, and offer him the freedom he needs." Only that, gradually, he started disappearing more and more. What'd I tell you? Something about dicks, I dunno. It became clear we we were done with each other. At least, he was with me. So, I got pissed and told him right off: If he wants to call it off, fine. Only he has to give me ticket money, because I had nothing. And that was that. He got me the money, end of story. And, the cherry on top: On my last night I slept on a bench in the station. No way! You slept in the train station?! And you say you've got all your marbles? Gemini... Yes, well... It's not a thing I'm proud of, I know. - From Santa. - Thanks! I did what I thought I had to. We all make mistakes. We do, but you were asking for it. You could say that. I probably lack the dumb enthusiasm from a year ago. But I don't think I'm more pessimistic. If it hadn't gone like this... maybe it've been more "safe". But I've always asked myself "what if?". I mean, I don't know, seems absurd to hang on to illusions just to avoid getting hurt. I prefer my illusions to sleeping in a train station. Yes, it's not so great. I seemed like a good idea at first, but you probably didn't think it out. Probably. I want to tell you something. I can't tell you here. Not here. Let's go outside. Really, I don't see why you're doing this. I want to talk to you. I think we've said all there was to say. I won't hassle you, I promise. I don't see where you're going with this. - I think I... - Is Paul here? Paul? Paul. He was here 5 minutes ago. You think I did this because I was bored? I don't know. Frankly, I don't care. I'm telling you: no. Like I said: I don't care. The sun'll rise just the same. I did have something important to tell you. Maybe. But what's it got to do with me? Please, come outside. I just called you. Your phone was off. I told you... It was that dead period nothing was happening. If I didn't get that pitch, I'd have to move back with my parents. There were times when I had other priorities. You saw I didn't have time for anything. I barely managed to... finish in time. - OK. So? - So... - You had the association... - I don't see the point. You had all these ideas... What's the assoc. have to do with it? Nothing. I think it does. You had your affairs, and... I thought I'd let you finish everything. Are you joking? This is all in your head. The only "affair" was spending time with you, that's it. I was kind of out, myself. I got the idea we were ignoring each other, and routine set in. I don't remember it like that, but whatever. Sorry, did you call me here to tell me how much our relationship sucked? No. Then why tell me this? I didn't consume myself enough? That's not what I meant. Tell me then. Why did you call me here? - I called you to... - To justify yourself?! Thanks. No need. The moment has passed. It's not about this. Then what? Seems like you want to dig up the past. - No, I just want to explain... - Explain what? Isn't it a little late? We gave a lot of explanations. What?s left? I was trying to... ...say something that... ...I really wanted to say to you. What? Why I did what I did. Why? I was wrong. You were wrong how? I was wrong, and... I don't know how I can... How I can change it. Change what? You're gonna call me an asshole. But I didn't realize then. What do you mean? I mean... ...the fact that... ...you're the girl I felt the best with. The happiest. Excuse me? That's the truth. What do you mean "the truth"? Do you realize what you're saying? Are you mocking me? No. Then? I can only say that... ...I realized that... ...it's you I need. - Really, you're talking nonsense. - I'm not. Then how can you talk like this? I was sure that... ...the past is past, but... ...I realized that... ...I need you. No shit? So this erases what happened? Of course not. I broke up with Adina because I was thinking of you. I realized I needed you, not her. I'm being completely serious. Do you realize how selfish you're being? You talk like the planets revolve around your whims. I know I wasn't fair to you. But... - I thought I was doing the right thing. - It wasn't fair... I'll tell you what wasn't fair. It wasn't fair that, months after, I thought it was me. That I did something. That I'm not good enough for you. That I'm too ugly, or too skinny, or not smart enough or I was boring you, or whatever the hell. That wasn't fair. I didn't want to give this impression. I told you then... ...what I thought was true then. That what's between us isn't enough, and... -...there was routine, and... - The routine was our problem, right? We barely had two years together. Can you get bored of someone that fast? I think your selfishness was the problem. It's all bout you. What can you do to satisfy yourself. I can't believe your nerve. What seemed true to you at the time... How quick you are to change your mind. You realize how much I went over what you told me then? That you didn't think you still loved me? Do you know the hope you saying "I think" gave me? It left a small window open. A weak chance that perhaps you do love me. Perhaps. Do you realize how much it took me to realize you were being polite? You don't. How many times I awoke crying, because we weren't together anymore. That you won't be with me anymore. That I love you, and you could care less, and that's that. And now you're at a different stage. You've reached a different conclusion. I don't give a shit about your conclusions. I don't need any conclusions, thanks. Do you think you could still love me? If I could still love you?! Selfish, go to hell! I don't wanna know you, leave me alone! I love you. Take your hands off me! Leave me alone, seriously! Forgive me! I thought I saw you at Cora this morning. - At Cora? - Yes. I haven't been to Cora today. No? No. I thought it was you. Today, for sure? Around 11. I went shopping. I must've been wrong. Get back here, bitch! I'll bust your head! Hey... What's the deal with monks? What monks? I mean, what are these guys into, what's their deal? Why, did you see one? Just asking. I don't know what they're about. Thinking of becoming one? No. You want to become wise, and don't know how. I was curious. These monks... What their deal is. I mean, their rituals. You're stressed, and want to relax by practicing Zen, right? Forget it. What am I, Wikipedia? Not much's changed. Sorry. I've been gone and... It's alright. You know me... Really, it's OK. I have this from Robert. Robert who? I guy I hooked up with last summer. Robert Dumitrescu? No. Who's Robert Dumitrescu? Doesn't matter. I have a surprise for you. Oh, my. Really? Pleasant, I hope. This you'll like. What would you say to going to Thailand for a month? How about it? - I don't know. - How's it sound? How could it? Are you crazy? You were into this stuff. Well, yea, they do... You always wanted to travel. - I still do. - So? I can't take a month off work. He'll kill me. Won't even give me a week. I said it was because of the association. And, for the pay you get, I wouldn't give 'em a second thought. Take a vacation. Maybe not a month. Two weeks at least. They'll survive. Maybe. I'm thinking about the money, too. It would be cool, but... No, it's a present from me. And it's not so expensive. On the contrary. The plane ticket's more expensive, that's all. You could do something worthwhile with that money. Well... I want to take you to Thailand. That's worthwhile. I'd like to, but... I don't know... I think it's not the time, yet. The right time is when you say it is. We could go to the seaside. Or to the seaside in Thailand. Come on... We could go to Vama Veche. Oh boy... Or to Portita. I've never been, I heard it's cool. To Portita... Yes, to Portita. Are you sure? Yea... We can go to the seaside. We don't have to go to Thailand to have a good time. You see?! And we don't have to decide now, on the first day. No. Portita is cool, indeed. It's better than Vama. Let's go to bed, I'm beat. We have to make the bed. I'll help. Funny how we just got back together and we're making vacation plans. Subtitle made by fuzzy @ KG
