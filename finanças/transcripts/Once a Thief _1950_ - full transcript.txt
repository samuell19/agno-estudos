Is this the one? Yes. According to these records, your conduct was excellent. Won't you give us the motive for all this? I had a reason. Please, don't... don't ask any more questions. Miss Foster, you must understand. We have to know everything behind this case. Now, you arrived in Los Angeles when? A little over a year ago. And you came here from San Francisco. What did you do there? I had a job in a factory for four years. When the plant shut down, I started looking for another one. I wasn't particular. I tried everything I knew to... ...to find any kind of decent work. The little savings I had had just about gone. I was finally down to one meal a day. When I met Pearl. Alone? When I told her the position I was in, she laughed. So you're hanging on by your eye-lashes. A pretty gadget like you. Look, kid. Life is just one big merry-go-round. And some day you're gonna land something great. You got nothing to worry about. Just stick around me. They're all so lovely, it's hard to decide. Take your time, madam. - Um, pardon me. - Excuse me just a moment. Do you have oyster forks in a blueboy pattern? Sorry, but that pattern has been long discontinued. We have something very similar, would you care... Um, no, I wanted them to complete my set, thank you. Here it is. You're getting the touch, kid. And you sure have good taste. That was how I enrolled into the school of shoplifting. I couldn't have had a better teacher than Pearl. She showed me all the usual tricks. And sometimes she invented new ones. Hey, lady! Miss. What kind of sandwich you got? Bacon and tomato, lettuce and tomato, double eggs, avocado, salame, Denver, hamburgers... chopped liver? Gimme a ham on rye, beer, please. Hey, Margie, do you mind if I wait on him? Sure, you can wait on him. He wants a ham on rye with beer. One Max Factor on rye, Eddie. In Los Angeles I turned over a new leaf. My boss Eddie was wonderful to work for. I liked my job, and I never gave my past experience a second thought. It was on that day that I became concerned about a girl. - Anything the matter? - Oh... no. But your food, you haven't touched it. Let me warm it up for you. No, thank you. Are you feeling all right? Yes. It's just that... well... I can't pay for this. Oh, I see. Flo, are there any more of my things in there? And would you bring a hanger or two, please? Thanks, something over there needs a hanger. Gee, I hate to put you out like this, Margie. Oh, it's no trouble at all. I was on the same boat myself a year ago. Only one thing, I hope you don't snore. Don't worry, I don't. How long have you been in town? Oh, I left Spokane about six months ago. Like a lot of other girls, I was stagestruck. Boy, I sure got out of that in a hurry. Then I tried modeling. And that's when your problem really begins, if you know what I mean. You couldn't think you'd have any trouble getting a job as a model. I certainly did, a lot of it. I floundered around for a while and... ...then my father sent me enough money to come home. If I hung around, I figured I'd land something. Where are you from? Me? I was born in a farm right out in the middle of nowhere. Say, I don't think these are any good at all. - Check them for me, will you, honey? - Hm-hmm. How long have you been working at the restaurant? Let me see now... it's over a year. I've saved a little money. I've got this elegant apartment to live in. And you couldn't find a sweeter guy than my boss Eddie to work for. Gee, I wish I could land something like that. - I got a hunch you can. - Do you? Sure, specially after that smile Eddie gave you. One tuna on white. Oh, Margie, want something? - Is my wimpy working, Eddie? - No, why? When you and Flo get together, I have to send up a smoke signal to get an order. I said a wimpy on a bun and hold the violins! - I'll get right on it. - One tuna on white. Margie, Eddie and I are going to a movie tonight. - Why don't you come along with us? - No, thanks, I'm always tagging along. Besides, I've only got a couple of hours to get some shopping done. - Oh, hello. - Hello there. Is my dress ready yet? I don't think you gave me a receipt. Oh, you don't need no receipt, lady. There it is. That yellow one with the paisley on it. - This one here? - That's right. - How much will that be? - That'll be 75c. Here you are, 15, 25. - Right? - Uh-huh. Put it on my arm, will you, please? Thank you... Wait a minute! Wait a minute, what happened here? It must have been like that when you brought it in. Oh, no! No, sir, it was not! - Now listen, lady, I'm telling you... - It was not! I paid $25 for this dress and... Twenty-five clams for that old sack? Yes... just a minute! Oh, for Pete's sake, look what you've made me do now. I'd like to see the manager. I'm just going to tell him about your attitude. I'm the manager. Something wrong, miss? Thank you. Well, it's just that my dress is damaged and this... This person here refuses to do anything about it. - So there's a little rip in it... - Alright, Gus, alright. Okay! You'll have to excuse him, miss, he isn't very bright. You know how it is with the help these days. Sure. Well, I guess I'm making too much of a... Oh, that's okay, you may be right. Let's see. This could have happened at the plant. Yeah, a mending job would show. Well... Miss, I'd say you're in for a new dress. I don't expect a new dress. That's alright, that's the way I do business. Say, there's a little dress shop up on 3rd Street. Would you mind very much if I went with you and helped you pick one out, Miss, um... Fair enough. Foster, Marjorie Foster. - But you needn't... - My name's Mitch Moore. - How do you do? - How do you do? Well, if it's okay with you, shall we go now? - Alright then, if you say so. - Sure! - Oh, excuse me a minute, will you? - Okay. Hey, Gus, give me twenty bucks. - Oh, I got it, but I gotta use it... - Shh! - I got it, but I gotta use it to pay off. - Come on, come on. What am I going to do when them guys ask for their dough? I'm sick and tired of covering up for you. Come on, let me have it. Tell them I'll square up tomorrow. - Oh... - Come on, come on! You ought to be able to handle simple things like that. You're being so generous about this. Honest, I'm ashamed now of making such a fuss. Well, I always like to make the customer happy. - Okay, let's see what they have. - Look, this is a pretty one, isn't it? - Yeah, it's alright. - You think so? Well, I don't know. Don't you think it's a little too gawdy? - Looks kinda... kinda cheap. - I guess you're right. Yeah, I can see you in something different. - Um, what's your size? - I'm a twelve. Twelve, that's what I thought. - Let me try and find something for you. - Alright. Now that's what I call a smart-looking number, don't you? - Yes, it is pretty. - You said it. Plain but rich-looking. Try it on. Well, this is the one you like, sure I will. Sure I will. And? So I just sort of went steady with Harold. I guess that's about it. Anyway, I'd rather talk about you. Well, I used to know a few girls. Lately I'd been going with the... ...the daughter of a big stockbroker here in town. You'd know him if I mentioned his name. Yeah, the old man had great plans for me. He was going to set me up in business. But I turned it down. That's not for me, having things handed to me in a platter. So I broke the engagement. - And the girl's heart at the same time. - Beyond repair. And ever since then, I, um... I play women from a distance. Uh-huh. How do you know when they're closing in on you? I can tell. Radar. And bringnig things up to date, what's your side of the story? - Me? - Hm-hmm. Oh, I'm still single. Well, that's a nice arrangement. You, uh... live alone? - Uh-uh. I share my apartment with a girlfriend. Her name's, Flo. Gee, I'd like to have her meet you. Why, sure, I'd like to meet her too. So, you're running that shop now. Yeah, I have been there for a couple of months. Oh, thank you. Well, let's get out of here, what do you say? Sure. It's beautiful. Really beautiful. Isn't it? - Yes, you are. - Oh... Honest, If I'd known something like this was going to happen, I would have torn that dress myself. I hope you don't please all the customers like this. Oh... oh, I'm sorry. Oh, it's all right, it's just that I'm allergic to lipstick. - You are? - Hm-hmm. Oh... gee! It is like being right up on top of the world. - What are you so happy about? - I've met him. First he bought me this beautiful dress. And then... Listen to me, Flo, listen. - Then we went to dinner, and then... - What time is it anyway? Oh, Flo, wait till you meet him. Alright, you don't have to listen. But I have to tell. Such a beautiful, big car he drives. I never saw anything like it, and his clothes! Oh, and he's so, so elegant. You ought to see the size of the tip he left. We don't get tippers like that down in our place. It's a silly thing to say about him, I know, only... He's so perfect. - How about a little liqueur? - Yeah, that'll be fine. Sure, ooh, special occasion. Oh, gee, I'm awful glad you could make it tonight, Mitch. - I knew you'd like Flo and Eddie. - Oh, they seem like a swell couple. We have an awful lot of fun together. - Coffee, folks? - Oh, sure. Let me help you. Thank you. Say, will you girls excuse me a minute, I want to talk to Eddie. Hey, that was quite a meal, Eddie. I'd kind of like to take care of it. - Oh, no, this is my party, forget it. - Well, thanks very much. Some night we'll all go out on the town, then it's on me. - Okay. Cigar? - No, thanks, I don't use them. Flo, what do you think of him? - Things are a little slow, aren't they? - Oh, about usual at this hour. We do most of our business at lunchtime. Oh, I see. Quite a game this restaurant business, isn't it? - Yeah. - You know, a while back I was interested... ...in opening a place on the strip. I could have handled it too. But by the time I built a stage for the entertainment I wanted to put in there, why, I figured I might as well build a new place. I found out you got to give people a little class. Now, I could take a place like this... Say, listen, why don't I come over some afternoon and have a little talk with you? Maybe we can work out a little deal. - Okay. - Alright. Oh, excuse me, will you? What's up, Gus? I come to talk to you about that Nicky girl. Why come down and bother me about her? Can't you see we got a party going on? Yeah, but this is serious. She wouldn't leave, I tried... ...and she was hollering and screaming. I was scared the cops were gonna come. - What did you do? - I called a taxi and sent her home. Then you got nothing to worry about. If she comes back tomorrow... Yeah, but you don't realize, she's off her beam. - She's liable to do anything! - Oh, let her. Let her? You remember the last time something like this happened. She cut her wrist. Well, if she's carzy, what can I do about it? Well, you gotta come and see her now. - Look, I'll call her tomorrow. - No, you gotta come and see her now. Are you nuts? I'm with these people, can't you see? Mitch, you'd better come and see her now! Okay, okay. Well, wait a minute, I gotta tell them something. Say, I'm awfully sorry, but I have to go back to the plant for a few minutes. Nothing's the matter, is it? Let me go with you... - No, no, no! - Give me a second to change. Oh, it's nothing serious, just a little mix-up and Gus wants me to straighten it out. - Duty before pleasure. - Yeah. - You won't be gone long, will you? - No, I'll be right back. Oh, um, don't be talking about me while I'm gone. Alright, come on. Nicky. Nicky. Nicky. Nicky! "Mitch, life without you is not worthwile. Nicky." Okay? She did it. Gas. - You mean dead? - Yeah. I don't know what gets into a dame like that. You better drop me off at the house. - No, you're staying with me tonight. - Oh, no, I can't do that. You're staying with me! Hello, Mitch. Gee, I'm glad you're back. - Everything alright? - Yeah, sure, everything's fine. Are your ears burning? - You know Gus here, don't you? - I sure do. Alright, it's all forgiven, Gus. What's the matter with you? Oh, I'm okay. - Come on, I want you to meet Flo. - No, no, I need a drink. Come along. - Set them up, Eddie. This round's on me. - Okay. Say, you whip up a mighty fine meal, young lady. Well, a girl should have something in her favor to attract a man. If I remember, you were doing okay before I ever met up... ...with your lamb chops and mashed potatoes. You know, Margie, there's nothing like a home cooked meal to break down the resistance of a single man. Oh, go on, that sounds like a line. Tell me more. I'm serious. You always struck me as the carefree type, with no strings attached. Well, it's the old story. A guy plays the field and... then something extra special like you comes along. Am I to gather from this that... I'm the number one girl in your life? If you want to know, yes. - I didn't want to tell you like this. - But why? Gee, I don't care how you tell me. I think it's wonderful. Only, I want to know why. 'Cause as much as I go for you, I can't do a thing about it now. I don't understand. I... I think it's only fair to let you in on something. I can't afford to get too serious. - I'm about to lose my shop. - Lose your shop? Well, things have been bad. I owe a lot. Like a chump I bought some equipment and got in over my head. Unless I pay up I'm going to close the joint. Oh, poor darling. Yeah, this has always been a tough town for me. So I'm going back east and try it there. You mean... you mean you're going away? Well, I've got to unless I get the money. Too bad it had to come at a time like this. Just when things were working out so well between you and me. Oh, Mitch, I'm sorry. You're not going to have to leave me. Not ever. - Boo! - Oh, you caught me. Oh, that old thing. You like it? - Uh-huh. I'll get you a better one. Give me the genuine article every time. Oh, I'm sorry, darling. Say, that was a very worthwhile kiss. Yes, sir, as a matter of fact, I think that kiss was worth roughly $1,000. Holy... I'm sorry I'm late, darling, I had to stop at the bank. Why, it's just like you said, Margie, where did you get all that? Oh, I had it saved up and then Flo lent me the rest. Flo? She has money? Oh, she has a little. I helped her save her pennies. You didn't tell her you wanted this money for me, though, did you? Oh, of course not, silly, I wouldn't do that. - Here, I'll give you my IOU. - You will not, it isn't legal. Why, don't you know that a... prospective wife... can't testify in court against her prospective husband... You know what I mean, silly. You know, Margie, you're a lot different from the usual run of girls a guy meets. Most of them are all out for what they can get. But with you... - Oh, Mitch. - How's it going, Gus? Oh, terrible. Hey, what's this with the new sport coat, and slacks and shoes and all that? Yeah, how do you like it? Got me a couple of new suits and some shoes. More new clothes. What are we going to do about the rent, the bills and all the other things that we owe? Oh, I'll take care of that. - Holy mackerel! - Any more new questions? Where did you get that wad? Take this down to the finance company for the car. Now here, buy yourself an ice-cream cone. Hey, who are you working on now, that Margie girl? - What gives you that idea? - Oh, I can add, can't I? You've been dating her, and now you show up with all this mazuma. So what's eating you? - Oh, you're asking for it. - What are you talking about, I've been all through this before and still no scars. Why do you keep working on them poor little working girls? Why don't you find yourself a rich widow? Or maybe they're too smart for you, huh? Listen, I only play the sure thing. - Oh... - What's the matter? I've been putting sugar in the salt shakers. I have an idea a lot of things like that are going to be happening... ...around here until Friday. Oh, Margie, I'm so happy for you. There's just one thing that bothers me. I'm going to have to desert my favorite roommate. Oh. I sure wish a guy like that would enter my life. Well, you've got Eddie. Yeah, and he's a great guy, but... I don't know, he's sort of the common garden variety. Eddie's alright. My goodness, who else would close this cafe all day Friday... ...so that you two can stand up with us? - Well, kids? - Got a heavy date? - I hope so. - Have fun, Phoebe, have fun. - Good night, ladies. - Good night. Uh-oh! Business is picking up. Never mind, dear, I'll get it. Hey, girl, is this table reserved? - Pearl. - Margie! I haven't see her since we were out in San Francisco! Pearl... let me get you a table in the back? I'll talk to you later. It's nicer back there and there and the jukebox is in there too. Okay, Margie, you fix us up. Come on, everybody! This is like old home week. Swell kid, that Margie, a swell kid. Even if she gets a little on my nerves. Hey, are you sure we're still in the same restaurant? Well we always see our parties back here because there's more room. - Pearl, sit down, please. - Margie, I want you to meet my friends. - Hey, um, this is, um... - Charles. - And this is, um... - Jack. Well, what are you going to have? - Two beers. - Scotch and water. - Scotch and water for me too. - And Pearl? Strength! Did you notice that blonde that came in with the other people? You can't miss her. She's the last person in the whole world I ever wanted to meet up with. - Ever! - Why? I'll tell you about it later. Sure is a noisy character. Certainly is. That's how she is when she's drinking. Flo, do me a favor, will you? Mitch will be by any minute to pick me up and I can't have him meet her. What's he got to do with it? Well, nothing... Honey, will you ask him to meet me at the apartment? Tell him... tell him I ran into a friend from home. Sure, honey, I'll cover up for you. I'll catch him at the door. - Here are your drinks, Margie. - Alright, Ollie. I'll stay back there and try to keep her quiet. Alright? Thanks. Hey, Margie, sit down and join the party. We oughta have one for old time's sake. You know, when you left me, I went over to Oakland... Pearl. Please, do you think that I could see you over there alone for just a minute? Sure! Excuse me, we got a lot of things to talk over. Uh-oh... wait a minute. - Oh, hello, Mitch. - Hiya, Flo. Margie had to leave a few minutes ago to meet a friend of her mother's. Oh? Now, don't be jealous, it's just a girlfriend from back home. And what gives you the idea that I'm the jealous type? Now, you don't have anything to worry about. Margie told us the good news about Friday. Congratulations, Mitch, you're getting a swell gal. Friday? Oh, yeah! Well, thanks. I guess that'll be happening to you and Eddie one of these days, huh? Oh, I don't know. Eddie and I have run around together, but it's not that serious between us. No? Well, I just wanted to make sure. No, Eddie's not for you, you can do better than that. - You think so? - I know so. Well, Margie said she'd meet you at the apartment in about an hour. You know where she keeps the key. Say, um, how about me hanging around and driving you home later, huh? Well, thanks a lot Mitch, but I'll be here for quite a while. Besides, Eddie will be here any minute. Eddie, eh? Well, so long. - There's a note. - Oh. Oh... He says he waited around for an hour and then he gave up. Well, you can hardly blame him. How about some coffee? Sure, I'd love it. Flo, you really think I shouldn't tell Mitch. I wouldn't if I were you. What happened in San Francisco is in the past. You might just complicate things. San Francisco. The mention of that town scares me to death. Well, maybe you're right. Only I'm glad I told you, I had to tell somebody. We never had any secrets. Still can't believe it. You being a shoplifter. Well, I was, Flo. You know I still have something left. - I'll show it to you. - What is it? - It's a watch. - A watch? Honey, don't you think you're taking an awful chance keeping it here? Chance? I don't know, I... I don't know why I kept it any more than I know... ...why I did such a thing in the first place. I know I've got here it among my things somewhere. Oh forget about it for now, Margie. Come on, let's have some coffee, hm? - Hi, Milton. - Hi, Mitch. Uh, just a minute. Well, well, well. It's been a long time, Mitch. I've been wondering. What are you going to do about the gold earrings? - Oh, forget the earrings. - Well, I've had them for a long time. Well, sell them. What do you think of that? - Hmm... nice watch. - You said it. What can you let me have on it? Not much but, um... Just a minute, I got to see something. Let's see the number... the number of this watch. Hm, there it is. Where'd you get this watch? Never mind, how much? Can't touch it. Why, what's the matter? This is a stolen watch, Mitch. - Stolen? - Yes. How can you tell? We get lists from the surety company every day, look. It says right here in this book this watch was stolen in San Francisco. How do you like that chiseler owing me dough and trying to pawn it off on me. You guys ought to be careful about stuff like that. I really should be calling the police. Now look, Milton, forget about the whole thing, will you? I'll be seeing you. Flo? Flo? Why, Mitch, darling, I didn't expect you so early. Hello! I'm awfully sorry about last night. That was a girl I used to... Oh, that's okay, I had a few things to take care of anyway. Ah-ha! So the bridegroom has last-minute things to attend to too, hm? Well, Margie, that's why I came over to see you. I'm afraid we're going to have to postpone the wedding for a while. - Postpone the wedding? - I can't even think of getting married. I'm in debt, I can't afford to get married yet. Well, I thought when I gave you the money... Look, if it's the money you're worried about, I'll sell my car and pay you back. Please, darling, I don't give a darn about the money, honest. Sure, what I borrowed from you helped me a little, but... But as for getting married so quick, I don't go for living in a cheap apartment, what kind of a marriage is that? Well, maybe we could live her, Flo wouldn't mind, I know... Oh, you don't want to stay here. We want a place of our own, a house, a few bucks in the bank besides. Sure we do, and then we'll have all that in time too. - Meanwhile... - Look, I've made up my mind. I'm gonna wait until I get on my feet first. Mitch... please tell me the truth. Is it something I've done? No, it's not that at all. What's all the hurry for anyway? It's just a matter of waiting. Waiting. People spend their whole lives waiting. Mitch, are you sure it's just the money, because if it is... Sure I'm sure. Look, as soon as I get squared away, everything will be okay. Isn't that fair enough? Besides, I may have to get out of town for a while. Well, then take me with you. I'll go anywhere, I don't care... I got a proposition in San Francisco and... - San Francisco? - Yeah. What's the matter, don't you want to go there? I realized that things were really bad for Mitch. I was discouraged. I had to do something to stop Mitch from going... ...to the one place to which I could never return. Hello, room 412, please. Hello, this is Margie. Yes... Oh, I'm feeling fine, thank you. Look, I'd like to ask a favor of you. And I was back in the familiar routine. I felt uncomfortable in the elegant clothes Pearl gave me for the occasion. Everything went according to schedule. Suddenly a cold chill came over me. My calm turned to fright. I knew Pearl had seen what had happened. If the jeweller did, he didn't show it. As I dismissed myself, Pearl remained. I couldn't arouse suspicion by taking her along. Marjorie Foster? - Yes. - Have you ever lived in San Francisco? - Yes. - Recognize this? You're under arrest for shoplifting. Come on. There was no use denying my guilt. And so, instead of a wedding ring around my finger, I would up with a handcuff on my wrist. My honeymoon was a dismal trip to the penitentiary. I knew they got Pearl and she must have given me away. Margie! Margie! It's me, Pearl! Margie! Margie! Hey, Margie, what are you doing? Get away from me. If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't be in here. Why, you dimwit! I like a chump helped you and that man. - You're the one that fouled things up. - Alright, but you didn't have to mix me up in it. Me squawk? Listen, you numbskull! You can accuse me of anything, but don't accuse me of ratting! Kids, Stuber! Stuber! Stuber... What's going on here? I'm sorry, Lieutenant, I slipped. Get back to your cell, you too. - Hello. - Oh, hello, you're Flo, ain't you? - Yes, that's right, is Mitch in? - Sure. Hey, Mitch! Thanks. - Hello, Mitch. - Hey, hiya, Flo. Boy, am I glad to see you. I just about gave up calling you anymore. I'd have come over to see you, but you're kind of a hard... I've been terribly busy, Mitch. With Eddie? Say, you're looking swell, kid. What did you really want to see me about, Mitch? Oh, I just wanted to talk over a few things with you. Now that Margie isn't around. You didn't even show up at Margie's trial. What would I do there? Can you blame me after all that... This thing that she did up in San Francisco was just unfortunate. Yeah, now she's gotta pay for it a year. Eddie had his lawyer try to look after Margie. But when she confessed, there was nothing he could do to even get her off in less time. Well, that doesn't surprise me. Eddie probably had a no-talent lawyer that knows from nothing. Well, if you knew somebody better, why didn't you do something? It's a little late now. Will you have a cigarette? No, thanks. I'll think it over, though. Maybe... maybe we can fix something for her. You'll be going up to see her Thursday. Me? Why should I? But it's her first visiting day. Are you going up? Okay, I'll tag along. I'll take you up in my car. Oh, that's good. I know once you see her, you'll feel differently. Hey, what's the matter, Flo, you look kind of worried. Oh, it's been a hard two weeks. Well that what I've been trying to get a hold of you for. Maybe it'll do you good to go out with me tonight... ...and paint up the town. We'll have a few laughs, what do you say? Thanks, Mitch, but Eddie and I have plans for the evening. Eddie, Eddie, Eddie! What do you see in that guy anyway? Why don't you give yourself a chance? I'd better be starting for work, I'll see you Thursday. Okay, Flo, okay. So long, Flo. - I'll pick you up at one o'clock. - Okay. Margie, you're wanted in the visitor's room. Thank... thank you, warden. - Come along, Margie. - I will, I will. - Margie! - Flo. Mitch... Gee, it's good seeing you. - Hiya, Margie. - You're looking good, honey. - How are you feeling? - I'm alright. How's Eddie end everybody down at the place? Oh, they're all fine. They all send you their love. Everything's the same. I see you two want to be alone, so I'll cut it short this time. I'll see you real soon. Is there anything special you want? Oh, no, thanks anyway, Flo. Nothing, just Mitch. Well, he's all yours. So long, honey. - I'll wait outside, Mitch. - Okay. Bye. You don't know what it does for me seeing you again. When you didn't write, I was worried. I thought maybe... Well... it's hard to know what to say in a letter. Mitch, I didn't tell you about myself because... I was afraid of losing you. Now you know why I was so miserable when you said you were going to San Francisco. Yeah. But this isn't going to change anything between us, is it? No... we'll... we'll pick up right where we left off. Oh, that's... that's what I wanted to hear you say. I know it's selfish of me to want you to wait. But if I thought I wasn't coming back to you when I got out of here, I... Oh, keep your chin up, everything will turn out. Alright. Now, tell me, how are things at your place? - Oh, a little better, it'll pick up. - Well, that's good! I've made up my mind to make the best of it and... ...maybe I'll get some time off. For good behavior. Your time's up. Well, I guess that's it. You'll be back soon? Aren't you glad you went up to see her? No. She and I are through, I told you that. - Why make her feel different? - I can't understand you. I'll do eveything I can for her because you're such a good friend, but that's where it all ends. You know, after I saw you the other day, I, uh... I even went after a big lawyer for Margie. You did? Did you tell her? Well, no, I didn't want to raise her hopes too much. Anyway, I pulled a few strings... ...and I got her one of the biggest criminal lawyers in town. You think there's a chance he'll be able to do something for her? Oh, yeah, sure. The only trouble is with a guy like that... ...before he makes a move he wants to be sure of his money first. Well, if it's any help for Margie, let's not worry about the money. That's easy to say. Hey, Flo, did Margie ever mention to you, uh... ...how things were going with my business? No, why? Well, lately I've had a streak of bad luck and... Well, I just about lost the place. I didn't know. So when this lawyer started talking money, - It was embarrassing. - I can understand. How much does he want? Well, first there's a retaining fee of... oh, about $200. And for him that's cheap. I can manage $200 if that's all it takes. Well, that's enough for him to get started. The whole cost won't be out of reason, will it? Oh, no, I lay the cards right on the table. I told him there wouldn't be too much in it for him. - What's the matter? - You scared me. It's so high up here. Look at that view. Nothing like it in the world. It's very relaxing. You know, Flo, you're okay. - Thanks. - I mean it. I've felt that ever since the first time we met. I've often wondered what things might be like if I'd met you first instead of Margie. Have you ever thought of that? Yes... a girl considers all the possibilities. - I had a hunch you had. - Mitch! You're not cheating on Margie, I told you she and I are through. Mitch, I... Flo... Flo, you remind me of a girl... A girl I used to go around with. She was the daughter of a big stockbroker here in town. You'd know him if I mentioned his name. - Well, right on time. - Hello, Mitch. - Here, let me help you. - Thank you. - I didn't see the key under the pane. - I think it's safer in my purse. Thank you. There you are, the money for the lawyer. Good. A hundred and fifty, two hundred. I'll see that he gets it first thing in the morning. I may as well tell you. Eddie doesn't hold out much hope for Margie getting an appeal. Oh, for the love of Pete, Flo. Must you drag that guy in every time? What does he know? Take him away from his bacon and eggs and he's lost. Oh, don't say that. Eddie does okay in his small way. Excuse me a moment. I want to put these away. Well, I see you've got things to do so I'd better shove off. I was just going to fix myself something for myself to eat. I'd ask you to stay, Mitch, but... I don't think it looks nice the two of us being here. What are you worried about now? - After last night? - Oh, that? Oh, Flo. Believe me, I'm harmless. Yeah, like a bear trap. Here, let me slip into an apron, I'll show you how handy I am around the kitchen. You sit down, you're rocking the boat. You know, Flo, there's nothing like a homemade meal to break down the resistance of a single man. Funny, a guy plays the field and... ...then something special like you comes along. - Good morning, Margie. - Good morning. Hello. The girl that's been helping Dr. Gordon has been discharged. Starting today, you'll be the doctor's assistant. The doctor made a request. Oh, thank you, thank you very much, Doctor. Being a trustee, you'll be accorded certain privileges. Report to my ofice in the morning and you'll be given further instructions. - Doctor, here's the list of new arrivals. - Thank you. Good luck. Margie, you can put on the other smock and have the first patient come in. Here's the list. Mamie Johnson. - What's the matter? - I'm looking to see if this thing is wired. Don't worry, sit down. Watch this, Margie, so you'll know how to do it. Yes, ma'am. Take it easy, will you, doc? I'm the sensitive type. Wait a minute, what are you doing there? - Put those back. - I got a headache. If you've got a headache, go to the infirmary... Stop beeping, I always get these here. Well you're not going to get these here any longer. Oh, teacher's pet. This is going to make you very popular with the rest of the guests. I don't care! It's much more important for me to keep my record clean and get out of here. Now go on! Go on, you heard what I said, get out! Joint's crawling with squealers. Like that sourpuss sitting at the trustees' table, see? - Third from the end. - That's Margie, I used to work with her. - You did? - Yeah. Well, for my dough she stinks. I need something to quiet my nerves. So the crackpot tells me to go to the hospital. I don't know what's got into her, I really don't. She used to be a swell kid. Coming, Mitch? - No, I told you I'm not. - Come on, don't act like that. Okay, okay, I'll tell her it's all off. You'll see, I'll get it over with once and for all. Mitch, no, no... Better let me tell her. The mood you're in you'll only hurt her. Hello, Margie. Isn't this something new? Yes, they gave me stripes and made me a trustee. Flo. where's Mitch, he's coming up today, isn't he? I don't know. Does his lawyer have anything to do with this? Lawyer? No. A big lawyer was supposed to have got in touch with you. Are you sure? No, sure, I haven't heard anything about a lawyer. That's funny. I understood that he... Well, you'll probably hear from him. You may be out of here sooner than you think. Oh, I hope you're right. Flo, I haven't heard a word from Mitch not since that day when you two were up here. Margie, I hate to tell you this this way, but... For your own good I think you ought to forget about Mitch. - Forget Mitch? - I mean it, Margie. Flo, what to you mean, what are you talking about? You've got to tell me, what is it? It's just that... since all this happened, you're being up here, I mean... Well, Mitch feels differently towards you. - I know. - No, he's going to wait for me. - He told me so himself. - I'm telling you this, Margie. Mitch wanted to tell you himself. It's just that he didn't want to hurt you. Hurt me? - And he asked you to tell me this? - No, but I felt I should. Thanks, Flo, for telling me this. I know it wasn't easy for you. Please don't go yet! Margie. Margie! Well, you didn't take long. Margie says she hasn't even heard from the lawyer yet. She will, get in. Perhaps while we're here we should talk to the superintendent. Maybe she's heard from him. Look, these things take time. A guy's got to get papers ready and... Well, are you going with me or not? It's over two weeks since I gave you the money for him. Two weeks and she's all excited. Do you think that's all he's got to do? Maybe if I went with you and we both talked to him, where's his office? Terminal Building. What's the matter, don't you think I can handle it myself? Margie, you're back early. What's wrong? No, nothing, Dr. Borden. Still no visit from your boyfriend? But if he's half as wonderful as you say, I'm sure there's nothing to worry about. See you Friday. I couldn't believe what I saw. Flo and Mitch together. Let us bow our heads while we pray. Oh God eternal, be merciful unto us and grant us thy grace, amen. The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want. He makes me to lie down in green pastures. Pearl. Pearl, please, you got to listen to me. I'm sorry, I was all wrong about you. Yeah? I know now who turned me in. I gotta get out of here. I want to see her. Who was it? Remember Flo? You know, the girl that worked with me at Eddie's. Yeah. My friend Flo turned me in. Just wanted to get to Mitch. Mitch, that's the guy you're so crazy about, isn't it? Flo was the only one I ever told about myself. Shh! Please, Pearl, you gotta help me, you've gotta help me get out of here. Quiet! We'll talk about it later. Jane, I gotta talk to you about Margie. That jerk, what's she done to you? Nothing, I know you don't like her, but listen. All right, girls, break it up. Yes, ma'am. Alone? Yes. Here. Hide it. A gun? But where did you get it? Don't ask any questions. I squared you with the girls... ...and you're breaking out with two of them on Easter day. - Now here! - But it's liable to be found and... I told them you're a regular guy. Well, thanks, Pearl. Who are the other two? What difference does it make? You're all set, that's what you wanted. - Yes, only Easter, it's so far away. - Don't be impatient, kid. - Now go on, stash it! - I don't... - I don't know... - Go on, get rid of it! I'd been counting the days. Seemed like Easter would never come. That day the monotony was broken by the rain. Oh, doctor, let me help you there. - What a rain. - Yes, I know. - Thank you. - That's our list for today. Oh, thanks. Margie, wasn't this bottle full just the other day? We've been very busy. Margie, what's been going on with this alcohol? - I said we've been very busy, doctor. - You're shielding someone, who is it? - I'll have to report this. - Doctor... Yes, Margie? Hello. The captain, please. Have her call the dental office. Thanks. I'm sorry to have to make an issue of this, Margie. But after all, you're responsible for this office. And it's up to you to keep track of things and... I've had faith in you and I've trusted you... Florence, your hair again! Go into your cell. Dr. Borden. Dr. Borden. Dr. Borden, please. The Captain would like to see you. Just a minute. Bye, Doctor! - Let's see those slips. - Sure. # Uncle Jake was third. Hot Toddy, ridden by Sea Stork paid 40/40 to win. # # 9.40 to place and 5.60 to show. # Where's the rest of them? # Nighttime paid $6 to place and 3.80 to show. # # Uncle Jake paid 5.60 to show. # # In the sixth at Arlington, Dusty Rose was the winner. # Pretty good day, huh? #...and Satchel was third. Dusty Road ridden by...# Look, Barry didn't pay up either. You let him get away with that? Oh, he's been having a tough time. When I need it, I get it! Oh, don't call him at his office. You'll only lose him his job. - I doubted she'd head for here. - Well, you never can tell. Well, let's get a load of the guy she's been running around with. Hey, where is everybody? What do I care about your car, just get that $18 over here. - Hey, what is this? - Nothing. Just looking around. - Hey, what do you think... - Take it easy! You might get hurt, bud. Interesting, a bookie joint. Belmont, Eleganza, Sad Emir. Well, you had them all. This wasn't what we had in mind. But the trip wasn't for nothing. Come on, let's get going. Let's go. Come on, get going! Get out of here. As I was approaching the of the heart of the city, the rain had stopped. It never rains in Los Angeles when you want it to. Hold them both. Bail $200 each. Charge: bookmaking. Another thing more. What do you know about this Margie Foster? - Margie Foster? - Yeah. Nothing much. I knew her, just a girlfriend, that's all. We know she was your girlfriend. What do you know about her being sent up? Nothing. What's your phone number, Moore? Rennick 4157 I mean where you live. Kennedy 5358 That checks. The tip we got on this girl stealing a watch in San Francisco... ...was traced to your phone exchange. So you don't know much about her, huh? Okay, fellow, I guess you'll need me, I'm a bondsman. Sure, shoot two birds with one stone, set it up. Not you, I'm talking about him. Sign here, will you? Why, he and I are together. Yeah, I know, Moore, but from what I just heard, you're a bad risk. What's the matter, we're both in on the same charge. Yeah, sure. Sergeant, I'll sign for this fellow. Okay. Right here. Hey, Gus. What's the matter? So it was you that squealed on Margie. You dirty no good... To think that you'd take her money and then do all that... Now wait a minute, there's more to it than that. Sure, sure. And on top of it all you tried to double-cross me! You and me are through. I'm sorry, Gus, I didn't mean it, I lost my head, that's all. Don't be mad now, wait till I get out of here first. Here, take my car. - Car? - Yeah, take my car. Oh, yeah, the car. You know you can't get a nickel on it. Remember, the finance company? Yeah, I know, but drive over to Eddie's cafe. See Flo there. Don't say what we're in here for. Tell her I got in here by mistake, tell her anything, but I know she'll bail me out. Yeah, sure she will. Yeah, hurry up, will you, Gus? Wimpy on a bun! Flo! Margie! - Honey, how did you... - Get your hands off me! One word out of you so help me, I'll... come on! We're going out the back way. Come on! Margie, are you out of your mind? I'm gonna kill you! Kill me? You put me behind bars so you could get to Mitch, didn't you? But now you never will, never! Stop it, Margie, you don't know what you're saying. I don't care what you do to me, but you got to listen. - Shut up! - Mitch was going... Shut up! You can't put the blame on him. I risked my neck to get here. It's gonna cost me plenty to settle this, but it's gonna be worth it. - Hey, where's Flo? - Oh, hello there. Flo? Oh, she's back there somewhere. What do you want? - Hello, boys. - Where's the boss? Right back there. The man with the pipe. What's the matter? You had a Marjorie Foster working here? - Yes, I did. But now she's in... - She was. She broke out this afternoon. Have you seen her? No, I haven't. How did she do it? We figured she'd be showing up around here some time. - Are you sure it was Margie? - Positive. We'll make a routine check-up. If she shows up, we'll expect you to report to headquarters immediately. Yes, ma'am. - Give me $200. - What is this? Come on, come on! No, 200, that's all I want. You have a Mitchell Moore, booked here? Mitchell Moore, Mitchell Moore... Yes, we got him. - I got his bail money. - Bail. Two hundred dollars. Wait a minute. Your receipt. Thank you. - I'll wait outside in the car. - Jailer! Flo, honey... Margie! - What are you... - Get in, Mitch, hurry. When did they let you out? I broke out. You broke out? Holy mackerel, Margie, you're going to get me in a jam. How did you get my car? I ran into Gus. He gave me the car. And he told me about the trouble you're in. Yeah, those stupid cops got me mixed up with somebody else. I'll straighten it out, though. I'd better get out of traffic before they spot us. Sure, you can't afford to take any chances, can you, Mitch? Say, Margie, I've been wondering, um... Where'd you get the money for my bail? I help up a liquor store. - You held up a liquor store? - Sure. You know there's nothing I wouldn't do for you, Mitch. Thanks. How much money did you get? - Two hundred dollars. - Two hundred dollars, is that all? That was the amount of your bail, wasn't it? Yeah, but you went for the wrong door, baby. You gonna take a risk like that, you might as well go all the way... ...and pull a worthwhile job. You mean like a payroll, or a bank, or... Yeah, with a lot of dough you and I could go away together, change our names, go across the border, we could live in style like I've always wanted you to, baby. - Where would you take me, Mitch? - Oh, we'd go to Mexico. Acapulco, it's beautiful down there, right on the ocean, we can have our own little cottage. Wait a minute. - What's wrong? - My lipstick, you're allergic to it. Tell me this now, Mitch. If I went, went all the way, and then I did what you ask, where would I come in? Honey, this is for you and me. For you and me. You mean... ...you'd take the money and give me the brush. Oh, baby, no, not me. Why, Mitch you'd be the first one to tell the cops. Just like you did before. Margie, who's been telling you things? I know all about you. You don't leave any loose ends. - Oh, Margie all this can be... - I was just wondering how far you'd go. Flo was wiser than me, wasn't she? Good for Flo. She's gonna be pretty happy now. She's gonna marry Eddie. - What did you bail me out for? - I'll tell you. I could have taken care of this with a three-cent postage stamp... ...or a five-cent phone call. But somebody's got to tell you off. Nicky can't, can she? And all those other girls whose lives you messed up, they can't, can they? - You're rotten, Mitch! - Rotten, am I? Why you cheap little two-bit crook, who do you think you're talking to? - I ought to... - Look, Mitch... look! Go on, keep talking. Tell me more about Mexico. Tell me about that little place... ...we're going to have together and all the other plans you've got for me. Why, Mitch, it's turning yellow. Don't worry, I'm not going to kill you. I never had any intention to. I'm in this too deep already because of you. Besides, they all waste bullets on dirt like you. Mitch, don't! No, stop! Mitch! No! Margie... - Subtitles - Lu?s Filipe Bernardes
