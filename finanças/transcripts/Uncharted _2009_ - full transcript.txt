Oh yeah I forgot you were here. Gettin' it, huh? I can't believe I just did that. We have a mayday, mayday. No, no, no. I need to take a dump. I need to take a piss. All right. Come on, Lane, Laine started this, she wants us to do this, take the camera. Javi, I don't care what Laine started, all right, man? I don't want it, I don't want the camera. Hey Christy? Don't go out there too far, all right now? Oh you worried about me? Yeah, baby I am, you know that. I always am. Michael grab this camera please. Javi, hey, no comprende my friend, don't know what you're sayin', I'm not taking the camera... What's your wife up to? Christy. Hey. Christy... What is it Michael? Christy. What is it Michael? Dude, she's gone. How can she be gone, what do you mean? I mean she's gone, man. We were just like, we were there and then she just disappeared. Something got her. Okay. Maybe there's something on the tape. We gotta find her. Maybe something on the tape that we missed. What? On the tape... Yeah check the tape out, dude. Hey. What are you doin' up? How you feelin'? What happened? How's your head? Uh, stopped the bleedin' earlier. It's not that bad. Not like South Africa bad, huh? Not even close. How long was I out? I don't know, 'bout five, six hours. Where is everybody? They went looking for help. And the pilot? He was the first one to leave. He took off by himself and he didn't look well. Was he sick? Hey look, I have some aspirin in my camera bag. Let me get you a couple. No, it's okay. Did the pilot radio for help? He tried but he didn't get a response. Did he say anything about this island? I'll be back, Greg. Where you goin'? All right, but you be careful. Those rocks look nasty. Nastier than Peru? No. Are you sure? Identical, Greg. We're just gonna get a head start right now, that's all. Hey, are you all right? Look, Laine, why don't we just wait for the rest of the crew to get back? We could but I just wanna take a little peek. Get a little head start, come on. I got a bad feeling about this. You trust me, right? Yeah. All right, so uh, you just wanna get some cut away and B roll stuff, right? Oh, I hate that thing. Put it in your bag. Come on, safety first. Hey, take it easy on that water. You think the two cases we have is gonna be enough? We don't have a choice right now. Food's gonna be a bitch. What is it? See something? It's nothing. You just did all that staring for nothing? You know what I really dislike about our job? Is that no matter how much we research and no matter how much knowledge we have, we always find out how little we researched and how much knowledge we don't have. That's the fun part. Oh yeah. Do you see that? You know these cats aren't rare, but the fact that they're on this island is. We just need to take the precautionary measures that we would normally take. Mm. Like the one in Guadalajara? That wasn't my fault. What? You're crazy. I couldn't feel my left arm for two days. You should've seen Michael when we got back home. That was funny. Man, I'm hungry. I can't wait to get back to the plane and get in my beef jerky that's in there. There's food on the plane? Well, just some snacks. Not much. That's all? Didn't plan on crashin'. How good is the mic on the camera? This is the moment. A moment of discovery. A moment of wonder. This is the moment that will now be revealed but remember, if you want the moment to last, it's still a perception. Discovery, wonder, maybe nothing. Let's find out. Laine. Did you see it? See what? This is not a good way to start a project, Laine. I mean, the plane crashin'. It's only an ankle sprain. Where's your camera? What? Where's your camera? Come on, you know the rules. Rules haven't changed. Seven years, seven. It's that feeling I get. It's that same old feeling. Now you know I trust you, it's not that but every time I feel like this, somethin' happens. Did the crew ever mention what time they were coming back? So how many days do we have left with food? Not many. The pilot has a crate of beans in the back of his plane. I got my snacks, but that's not a lot. It's what, beef jerky, some chips, crackers. The others take some food? Very little. All right. I'm gonna go plan my shot list for our next round in the jungle tomorrow. Cool. I'm gonna hit the hay right now but um, first I'm gonna review the tapes, make sure they're not damaged. I'm working. Okay, okay, okay. My name is Javier Nunez and I am the key grip, gaffer and sometimes I do Craft services for the team. Okay, how's that? Am I done now? We're good? This is my truck. I'm not an actor. Hm, vulnerabilities. Here's my vulnerability. How's that, Greg, you like that? And my strength, yeah. And when it does, I'm gonna buy that wife of mine that house she's always wanted. I love you, baby. Black jaguars, here we come. You scared? You know, you shouldn't be. Jaguars don't like fire. Nah, it's not that. It's just, I've been freezing my ass off every night and I can't sleep. Take a drink. It'll warm you up and put you to sleep. That stuff actually helped my headache. Ah. You don't sleep in the nude, do you? Not unless you want me to. Goodnight, Greg. Goodnight. Yo, Laine. Hm? I'm sorry about today. I mean with the camera and all that. It won't happen again. Thank you. And thanks for saving our lives. Ah. Mayday, mayday, this is 201, can you read me? Over. This is 201, can you read me now? Over. This is, Nancy 201, Jackson Mary, I repeat this is Nancy 201, Jackson Mary. We have an S.O.S., mayday, our plane has gone down, do you copy that? Yes, very, coordinates... I don't have our exact coordinates. We're somewhere off of Gabriola Island. I repeat we are somewhere off of Gabriola Island, do you copy that? Yeah, Mary, and we should be there shortly. Over. Do you copy? Copy that. What are you doin'? No, you did not just talk to someone on the radio. They'll be here shortly. Nice, nice. At least you learned something from Jeff. I'm sorry. Don't be. Let's get to working. We don't have a lot of time. Extinction comes to all. You still have that feeling today? I'll be all right. You know, I think we have something here, Greg. Something special. I trust you. Okay let's go. Oh, hold on. What are you doing? Bum knee. Old high school football injury. You never played football. '93 marching band. I accidentally got tackled. You know, Laine, what if our producers got it wrong? I mean, what if what's out here isn't really a jaguar? I mean, you yourself said, "How would they get here?" Then what is it? I don't know. Maybe some like new breed or something. Could be. I mean living in this ecosystem can change an animal. Especially if it's not the normal habitat they're used to. How much more footage of these trees you want me to get? You know, I saw something earlier. Eyes. Saw a pair of eyes. Eyes? Yeah, but there was something different about them. Something intelligent. Something, I don't know. We just need to be careful. No, no, no, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. You can't freak me out with a story like that and end it with, "We need to be careful." We are always careful, Laine, but for you to say it, okay, now I'm worried. Why? Instincts, instincts. Follow it, follow it. Wait, wait, wait. Laine, Laine, wait a minute. You can't just take off and run like that, you oh, god. What could've done this? This isn't a jaguar, Greg. Then what is it? This is a family of jaguars. Um, let's head back, all right? The rest of the crew's probably waiting for us. Come on, Laine. Laine. I'm just worried, that's all. Maybe they're already saved. I mean, them getting saved and finding us can be the difference of a day or two. They're coming for us. Soon. Look, I don't wanna sound like a pussy or anything because we've been in worse situations and in nastier places than this but I feel naked out here. Sounds funny, but I don't feel equipped. It's just because we didn't prepare for this, Greg. We're good, though. Believe it or not, we're not that bad off. Can I tell you something about Jeff? Will it make you feel better? He said no one could make Laine happy. What does that have to do with our situation? Nothing, it just stuck in my head, that's all. So, what do you think about those guts on that rock? You know, I'm not afraid to talk about him if that's what you wanted to know. Do you wanna talk about the divorce? Let's just talk about the jaguar. Do you think they led us to that rock? I mean, I don't know if they're capable of doin' something like that but somethin' tells me they wanted us to see that. Those cats are cunning. Smart. Maybe. Let's go back tomorrow and find out. Then it's a date. I'm gonna go get something to show you. I'll be right back. What the hell is your problem? Did you see the others? Maybe, maybe not. I don't see anything. Is this the right spot? What happened? I don't know. I want a shot of those trees and then I want you to come down and follow it to where the blood trails were at and stop at the rock. I'm gonna squat down in frame, say my little thing and then exit into the jungle. Hey, let's not stop until we get something to take back home with us. Something good. Yesterday it looked like a bloody massacre. Today just an eerie aftermath. A sequel that leaves even more unanswered questions. Somewhere out there lies the truth. Explanations to questions that maybe, just maybe, should be left unanswered. Let's stop asking questions. All right that was good, I think we got it. Let's get back. Anything else? It was probably just the wind. I'll, I'll get some rope, I'll tie it down, don't worry, I'll take care of it. I need this, Greg. We need this. It was just the battery. I can't afford another loss. You're Laine Wells. With your name and reputation, backing's not a problem, distribution's not an issue. Look, listen to me, once we're rescued, we'll regroup with the others, we'll fly back here and get all the pick ups that you need. You know our producers will give us the budget and the extension. But we lost money on the last two films. This... Don't even think about those. I need you to focus on this one. Laine, you've never let me down. How many batteries do we have left? Um, I just have a couple, like, can always charge them in the plane, but, but I'll have to use the plane juices. The small generator, the gear, I sent it with the plane that's probably already at Gabriola. Where's the pilot? He's not there? John Andrew? Hey, John Andrew. He's probably out drinking. Yeah, probably. I mean where'd you find that guy? He couldn't be our only choice. He was our only choice? Yes. Because of um, time or budget? Both. Forget about it. I trust you. Gettin' that, huh? Oh, you mean like this? Oh god. I can't believe I just did that. What you doin'? I just showed my boobs. Let me see. Oh yeah, I forgot you were here. So what's goin' on? What are we doin'? Greg, I'm not really a very good on the spot talker, you know that. I'm a sound guy. I am uh, one of the fantastic five on team Cinema Verde original uh, members assembled uh, back at Cal State University North Ridge. Whoa, sea sign. Whoo hoo, sea sign, yeah. Um, I don't, I don't know what to say. Come on, tell 'em, why don't you just tell 'em? Okay. That's not all I do. I'm also production manager and accountant and I Have a big pimple on my face and I would really appreciate it if you got that camera out of there. That's all I have to say. So, honey. Why don't you get us when we're drunk or like, when we're movin' around. Uh, it'll be a lot... Honey, I'm just warning you, Greg's out here. Huh? He's out here again. Let's just give him what he wants. Okay, well I'm not addicted to the pain killers anymore and in two months I'm gonna give one of my kidneys to my sister and I love my wife very deeply. Ooh. And I love my husband and I love my new boobs. Whoo. Oh, why do I always do that? She bought those a long time ago. Greg. Greg is that you? Can I help you? Were you just throwing rocks at me? Why, should I? Why didn't you tell me you were sick? I knew. You could've killed us. Are you hearing me? You could've killed us. I'm grounded, I was suspended. You knew that when you came to me. Remember saying, "Hey John", don't tell 'em I could." Remember that? Yeah well, I didn't know that you were drunk that day. Drunk. You thought I had speech problems? Hey, hey, what's going on guys? Nothing. It's nothing. Hey John, do you know anything about Gabriola? Yellow. Carbs and high in fiber. No, Gabriola the island, I'm trying to figure out where we're at. Oh, I don't even remember... When I talked to the rescuers on the radio earlier, they said they'd be here shortly. Why does it seem like they're having trouble finding us? Yeah, John, I mean, why don't you call 'em, tell 'em where we're at, it's not like they can't see the plane from the sky. I think there's a reason why I can't answer your questions, right? Why? Ask your boss. What's that supposed to mean? What the hell is your problem? Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, John, John, please, please. Hey, Laine, please. Come on, come on. What's that all about, huh? Dang, girl, you been working out, you're a beast, look at that. Girl, you got muscles. Help! Hey. Hey... Help! Hey! Help! Hey! Rescue team should've been here by now, huh? I'm going to take your advice. We can wait on the footage. I think we should look for the others. I mean we should at least check the southwest parts. Can I ask you something? How come you never talk about your divorce? 'Cause I don't really think I ever had a marriage. I liked Jeff, you know? I mean, before. He was like, one of those perfect good looking guys you just wanted to hate but you couldn't. I could. I don't blame him for cheating on me. No, no, no, no. Nobody deserves that. Yeah well some people do. Did you ever wonder, you know um, we should maybe get some rest. You ever think we'd make a good couple? I don't know. Maybe. Maybe not. Goodnight, Laine. Goodnight. Michael! Christy! Javi! Michael! Christy! Jav! Michael! Christy! Laine! Laine! Laine! Laine! Laine, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Laine, Laine, it's okay, it's okay, you're safe now. You're safe, I'm here. It's okay. What happened? They were chasing me. What? Are you okay? I need a drink. Let's uh, let's get back to camp. Whoa. What's wrong? Greg? It's okay. They would've killed me. Did you see what they looked like? No, but I could hear them breathing. I nearly saw it. The growling. They were that close? I could smell them. Greg, they're toying with us. Yeah, let's um, let's get back to camp. Okay? I couldn't find him anywhere. Who cares? He's a big boy, he can take care of himself. Here. Take one for the team. Come on. Nice. Ugh. Okay, this one. Here's to not being rescued. Do we have any more food? 'Cause I'm kinda hungry. Not for tonight. We only have enough for two more meals, so, I'll give you something in the morning. You think the others are okay? What are you looking at? Nothing. No, yeah, they're fine, they're fine. I mean, come on, big Javier, who's gonna mess with him? And you know Michael. Oh yeah, Michael. He's a wilderness guy, all right. You're crazy. Hey look. I found it in the airplane when you were looking for John. Hm. Batteries are old, but it might last us through the night. Later on we could turn it up. You know those kitties hate noise. Oh hey, about that, you know, I'm really sorry I didn't get to you fast... Are you still in love with Jeff? I divorced him. Are you still in love with him? Did you know I took belly dancing classes for him? Yeah. How? Did he tell you? No, actually, I told him. Remember that job we did in Hawaii? Afterwards, you guys had a few drinks and you started to dance for him. He passed out. I saw you from my bungalow. So I suggested it to him in the morning. Well then it's only fitting that I give you the first one. You never danced for him? No. That ugly pilot isn't around is he? No. Oh my god, I can't believe I'm gonna do this. Okay. All right. I hope we get off this island soon. Get a search party and come back for our friends. I'm gonna get back on the radio later. Maybe they're close to finding us. You know you hurt me last night. What? Yeah. When you laid me on my back and you got on top of me and rode me, got a rock in my butt. See that's what I'm talking about. Laughter. We have to keep each other smiling. What's the difference between a white owl and a black owl? A white owl goes, hoo, hoo. A black owl goes, who dat, who dat? It's not good. All right, my turn. Oh, I gotta hear this. Um, okay. How does a blonde part her hair? You're crazy. You are crazy. See, I can be loose. Yeah, yeah, I know, I know. It's nice to see you smiling like that. I haven't seen that in a long time. Yeah. You know I meant what I said last night. Which part, the uh, or the um, "Goodnight Laine." No. Yes. When I said that I can make you... I, I know you can. Gunshot? John Andrew has a gun. John is that you? Greg come here. Holy shit. John Andrew what are you doin'? What's wrong? Hey what's wrong? Did you see something? I saw a body. A girl's body. Where? About 20 yards down that way. We have to go check it out. I shot one, it was by the body. Will you help me take Christy's body back to camp? Have you seen my wife's purple shoes? Okay, well that's easy because there's nothing bad to say about Laine. Oh get out... Come on. Baby, we're all gonna say it. You're not gettin' off that easy. Come on. Okay, okay, fine. If there's one thing that's bad to say about Laine is that, sometimes she's too ambitious. I think everybody thinks that. She's a little over the top ambitious-wise but that can be a good thing, but it's just, you know, I personally, I'm not that way and I don't know, anyway um, so, Javier, I think it's your turn next. Well, I'm gonna keep it short and sweet. I love Laine. The greatest thing about her is that I met my wife through her. Aw. I love you baby. Um, she has very strong convictions. Like if she sets ff to do something, it's gonna get done. Um, with our help of course. She's very uh, trustworthy and truthful, well trustworthy. I'll go with trustworthy, yes. Those are good things, right? Yup. Those are good. What am I going to tell her family? I mean, what about the rest of them? Where's the rescue team at? Where's the help? I don't know. I don't know. Bad news. Help ain't coming. What do you mean help ain't coming? They having difficulty find us. What do you mean difficulty finding us? We're near Gabriola Island. I'm not sure we're around Gabriola Islands. I think we might be uncharted. Uncharted? Doesn't mean they can't spot us. They can rescue us in few hours or a few days. Days? Days. On the tape... Yeah check the tape out dude. Wait, did you hear that? What? Michael did you hear that? What? Come on Michael, this is it. Javier, wait a minute, wait a minute. Let's move. Dude, hang on. Javier! Man. Michael! Javier! Michael! Javier! Oh my god. They're coming for me. They got Christy, oh my god, it's right behind me. Somebody help me. Somebody help me. No! No god no! Laine! Laine! No! They took her. Son of a bitch. I'll be back. I'm going with you. Me too. No, okay what if help comes? Stay in the plane and lock the door. Let's go. This is it. It's as far as we can go. What? Well maybe a mile or a mile and a half. That's it... Come on, John. I need to find my friend's body. I don't know what's beyond this point, Greg. I need to find Christy. You may not like what you find. Think my other friends are still alive? Let's hope. Not the answer I was lookin' for. So how'd you get a name like John Andrew? Born Andres Gregorio. Huh, yeah. Long time ago, I heard something. Things about the islands on the Gulf of Mexico. What kinda things? Things you don't wanna know. Great. That girlfriend of yours is a real piece of work. Oh she's not my, my girlfriend. I used to have one like that. Back in the days. Yeah? What happened? This what happened. What do you think our chances are of getting off this island? Fair. Just got to be smart. Greg? Is that you? Do you ever feel scared? Me? A guy like you? I'm scared right now. Um, let's uh, let's go that way. Looks like there's less stuff in our way. I hope you have your gun ready. Do you really think there's jaguars out here? I don't think they're jaguars. Then what are they? Open up Laine, open up! Where's John? Greg, where's John? They got him. Oh fuck. They got him. Those things. Those beasts. They got him. They got him. They got him. They got him. My name is Laine Wells and I'm the leader of, I'm the leader of the Cinema Verde Documentary Group. I'm not sure what fate has in store for me but should it be what I think is going to happen then, I only hope that someone finds this tape. I was told that no one could make me happy but they were wrong. I was um, thinking about... I'm sorry. I'm sorry, guys. What are you doing, Laine? I'm so sorry. What? I'm sorry I killed everybody. What? No, no, no, no. Don't, don't say that. Don't say that. Look at me. Don't you quit on me, Laine. Don't you dare quit on me, you hear me? I need you. Please don't leave me. We can't just sit here. What else can we do? Remember in Rio de Janeiro when Javier ate those burrito looking things? He must've went to the bathroom at least eight, 10 times. I know he stained his underwear that day. Javier never wore underwear. Rollerblading in Spain. Remember Christy's dress flew up? Beaver shot. Why doesn't anyone in our crew wear underwear? I'm gonna get the flare gun. I can't see it. Wait, wait, wait, wait. If something happens, you run back here and lock that door, you hear me? What do we do? I'm gonna shoot the flare. No, no, no, wait, wait, we only have one flare. This is our only chance, we might not have another one. What if they don't see it. What do we do? I don't know, I don't, let's think about it. I'm gonna shoot the flare. No, no! I had to. You all right? Thank you. For the seven best days of my life. Let's go flag it down. I'll go. You stay in here. I'll protect you. Promise. Greg! Greg! Greg! Greg! Greg! Laine. Get on, no, they're pulling you. Let go, Laine. No. No, let go, let go. Lock the door. Lock the door. Oh okay. I know that we're gonna need a lot of luck, so, rub my boobs for luck. Okay. Whoa, whoa, whoa, we don't need luck, okay? We got Laine. Laine, Greg likes you, he always has. Shut up. He always has. Don't say that. He's just too big of a pussy to tell you, that's all. That's all, what, what? Don't move, you're hurt pretty bad. What do you think happened? I don't know. Heard stories about these islands. About people eating people. What? I never believed it. Laine. Where's Laine? He's, he's asking about some woman. He was on the beach by himself. Don't move. We're gonna get you some help, you're gonna be okay. Do you think it's possible? Cannibals? I hope to god, not. Kevin, I'm scared, get us out of here. Okay.
