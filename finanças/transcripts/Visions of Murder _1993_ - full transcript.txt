[eerie orchestral music] [phone dialing] [phone ringing] - [Answering Machine Voice] Hi, this is Katherine. I'm sorry I can't take your call. Please leave me a message and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. Just wait for the beep, and have a great day. - [Woman] Katherine, I got your message. I'm coming right over. Now don't give up, we can get through this. Hang on, just hang on. [dramatic orchestral music] [phone ringing] [car horn honking] - [Voice On Answering Machine] Hi, this is Katherine. I'm sorry I can't take your call. Please leave me a message and I'll get back to you as soon as a can. Wait for the beep, and have a great day. - [Woman] Katherine, please pick up the phone. It doesn't have to be this way. [dramatic orchestral music] [tires screeching] [tires screeching] Will you let me in, please? Thanks. - [Man] What's going on? - [Woman] Excuse me. Katherine Hopkins' apartment. - I don't know. - [Woman] Katherine? Katherine, open the door. Where's the manager? - He doesn't live here. - [Woman] Do you have a key to this apartment? - No. - [Woman] Do you have a hammer? - [Painter] Get out of here before I call the police. - [Woman] I already called the police, where's the hammer? - [Painter] Whoa, where are you going with that? - [Woman] Katherine? Katherine? Oh I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. [siren sounding] - How did you know she was in trouble, ma'am? - She left a message on my machine. - And what's your relationship? - I'm her therapist, Doctor Jesse Newman. - [Woman] Good morning, Jesse. - Good morning. - Your three o'clock canceled, and you have a new patient at 10. - Oh Stacey I can't take any new patients this week. - Well, I tried to give her to Phil, but she said it had to be you. - Did she say why? - Her name's Gloria Hager. Doctor Singleton wants to see you as soon as possible. Jesse? I'm sorry about your patient. - There you are. - Ah, good morning, Gwen. - Good morning. Exactly what did you think you were doing last night? Jesse, suicide requires a response team. Now, what if you had found her holding a 45 to her head, and what if she had turned it on you? - She was in so much pain. I couldn't help her with it. - Jesse, it's okay to identify with people in pain. That's what makes you a good therapist. - Not good enough. - Jesse, you're only human, you can't save the whole world. You rose above your own pain, and you turned your life around. I admire you for that. You've got patients who need you. - Thanks, Gwen. - [Woman] You'll have to bear with me Doctor Newman, I'm a little nervous. - Why don't you call me Jesse? And I'll call you Gloria. - All right, Jesse. - Do you mind if I tape our sessions? - Why? - Sometimes it's helpful. Our sessions are strictly confidential. - Okay, I guess. - [Jesse] Is this your first visit to a therapist? - [Gloria] Yes. - [Jesse] Was there some reason why you requested me? - Ken Koplin recommended you. - [Jesse] Who? - Ken Koplin, he's your lawyer. - I don't know him. - He referred me to you. - Well, why don't you tell me something about yourself. - This is difficult. My husband just got a big promotion, he's under a great deal of stress. I love him very much. He loves me too, it's just, he likes to have everything under control, but sometimes he loses control. Oh God. - [Jesse] Is he physically threatening to you? - It's not me I'm worried about, I have a daughter. If something happens to me, I want to make sure she'll be safe. Can you keep her safe? Can anyone keep anyone safe? I'm so sorry. I've told you too much, already. I deserve whatever I get. - No you don't. - I made a terrible mistake. He's be furious if he knew. If you knew everything, you'd hate me. - [Stacey] What happened? - Did you see Missus Hager? - She flew through here like a bat out of hell. [phone ringing] - Hello? - [Jesse] May I please speak with Gloria Hager? - She's not here. - [Jesse] Will she be back soon? - [Man] Who is that, Kimberly? - I don't know Daddy. - Hello, who is this? - [Jesse] Jesse Newman. - [Man] Gloria isn't here right now, may I help you? - No, thank you. Just tell her I called, please. - [Man] Jesse Newman called. Who is that, Gloria? - [Gwen] Seven o'clock. You're gonna burn yourself out if you're not careful. - I'm almost finished. - I'll lock up on my way out. - Goodnight Gwen. - Goodnight. - Who's there? Gwen? Gloria? [eerie orchestral music] [phone ringing] - Counseling center. - [Man On Phone] Jesse? - Who is this? - [Man On Phone] How many ex-husbands do you have? - Hal, it's been a while. Is everything all right? - [Hal] That's why I'm calling you. I saw your name on a police report. The Katherine Hopkins... - Suicide. - [Hal] Yeah, I thought maybe you could use someone to talk to. - Oh, that's sweet Hal. I'm fine. - [Hal] Well, I need someone to talk to. Can you meet me an Blackburn's? I'll buy you a coffee. - Okay. [crowd murmuring] - You haven't changed. - Your hair's different. That's life, I just cut it short. - It looks great. - Thank you. - Two more please. - [Jesse] So how are you? Keeping the city free from crime? - I'm trying, I'm trying. They say you found the body. You're not blaming yourself, are you? - No Hal, I'm fine. - I never liked the way you say fine. - I never lost a patient before. Can we change the subject? - You like to talk about everyone's feelings but yours. - As I recall, you didn't like to talk about feelings either. - It doesn't mean I don't have them. I think about us sometimes, Jesse, what went wrong. Maybe if I'd been more open with you, maybe you wouldn't have had your depression. - You mean breakdown. I was a little nuts. - Nuts? That's a clinical term they taught you in graduate school? I'm proud of the way you pulled yourself together, Jess, went back to school and all that. - You've done all right, too. - We should have been there for each other, not withdrawn and gone crazy by ourselves. - You didn't go crazy. - I lost you, Jesse. That was crazy. - Hal, please, it's been eight years. Let's not look back. - I want you to know I'd handle it differently today. I'd be there for you. I just wanted to tell you that. What's wrong, Jesse? - Nothing. I thought I saw somebody I knew. I was mistaken. [phone ringing] - Hello? - Gwen, did I wake you? - [Gwen] No, Jess? - Go back to sleep, we can talk tomorrow at the clinic. - [Gwen] No no, I'm awake now. Um, what do you want? - What do you know about hallucinations? - Jesse, are you still working? It's almost midnight. - Well I'm worried about one of my patients. - Jesse, I told you this morning that you are getting too involved with your patients. If you get too obsessive, you're not going to be of any help to anybody. Okay, what are her symptoms? - Hallucinations. They only last a couple of seconds, but they're so real, she can't tell the difference between the hallucination and reality. - [Gwen] What about auditory hallucinations? - No, only visual. - [Gwen] History of drug abuse? - None, whatsoever. - [Gwen] Okay, well you may be looking at some sort of psychosis. - That's what I thought, too. - Suggest a complete physical, and a chemistry panel. Sometimes these things can be controlled with medication. Jesse, if you don't stop taking your work home with you, we're gonna have to hospitalize you. - I know Gwen, goodnight. - You can't force feed therapy. If a patient walks out, you've got to let them go. - This woman is in real trouble, Gwen. Her body language, her speech, the look in her eyes. She is terrified. It's like she's calling me. - Do you need a vacation? - No. No, that isn't necessary. I have things under control. [dramatic orchestral music] [engine starting] [slow moody jazz music] [crashing] [siren blaring] - How are her vitals? - Her pulse is good. [Jesse gasping] - Relax, relax, relax. Pulse 88, blood pressure 125 over 80, respiration normal. - Looks like we have a small cut on the left side of her scalp, a little bleeding. No broken bones or fractures? - Not that we can see. - [Jesse] Everything, man, man. - Was there someone else in the car with you? - [Jesse] No, yeah he was there. Man in the back. - Is she DUI? - We'll close the cut and do a toxicological screen. Restraints. - According to witnesses she drove her car straight into a barricade. [eerie orchestral music] - You should be in bed. Come on. - Where am I? - You're at Saint John's Hospital. It's okay. - What are you doing here? - You still have me down as who to call in case of emergency. Scoot over. To tell you the truth, I'm flattered. - Why are the doors locked, Hal? - Jesse this is the psychiatric ward. They lock the doors at night. - Gloria. - Who's Gloria? - I have to get home. - As soon as you're feeling better. - I'm fine. - Jesse, you're not fine. - They think I'm crazy? - They think you may have tried to kill yourself. - What are you talking about? - The police report says you aimed your car at a barricade, and gunned it. You're lucky you're not seriously injured. - You don't really believe I tried to kill myself? - You did before. - I'm a different person now. You can't believe I'd do that. Not now. - You are under a lot of stress, maybe. - What are you doing? - This is just something to help you sleep. - Oh Hal, I have to stay awake, I have something to tell you. - Jesse, please take it easy. - This will take effect very quickly, and you can stay if you like. - Yeah, please. - Hal, you have to listen to me. There was a man in my car, in the back. - Jesse, there were witnesses. No one was in your car. - I've been seeing him, and Gloria. Gloria is my patient, she, she's been hurting. I know... - [Doctor] Has she ever had delusions before? - Yeah, once before. 13 years ago, when we lost our baby. I mean, it was a born dead. She kept imagining that she could hear the baby, crying for her and, the doctor said it was just grief and postpartum depression, all that. They said she'd get over it. - And then what happened? - She tried to kill herself. - [Nurse] The doctor should be in sometime this morning. He'll want to take a thorough look at you. I'm sure we'll want to keep you here at least a day or two. We want to make sure you're good and healthy. - [TV Reporter] This is a KNBS news break. Newly appointed Admiral Truman Hager, commanding officer of the San Pueblo Naval Station, reported his wife missing to the naval investigative service. Gloria Hager apparently disappeared from their home late last night. Stay tuned to channel 15 for new developments. And in other news, flood warnings are still in effect, and the Coast Guard has issued small craft warnings along the coast of the entire bay area. We've just received word from the US Weather Service concerning the storm, and we have issued a small craft warning now, from the Oregon coast south to Monterrey Bay. - San Francisco Police, Officer Glennon. - Detective Hal Winter, please. - He's out. Should be back in about an hour. - May I leave a message please? I think I have information about the missing woman, Gloria Hager. - Can I have your name and address? - Why? - We'll send someone out to take a report. [dial tone] - Where are you going? - [Jesse] Out. - You can't leave. - Yes I can, my observation time is up, and you have no grounds to hold me. I'm not a danger to myself or anyone else. Now, if you want me to stay, I suggest you get a judge and a psychiatrist down here, but I don't think you want to do that. - Oh please. - [Cop] Can I help you? - Jesse? Jesse, how did you get here? - I rented a car. - No no, I mean, what are you doing out of the hospital? - Can we talk up in your office? - [Hal] Where did you meet Gloria Hager? - I already told you, she came to my office a couple of days ago. - And where did you say you saw her fighting with this man? - I was at the restaurant with you, but I'm not really sure where they were. - Jesse, what kind of drugs did they give you at the hospital? - What does that have to do with anything? - [Hal] Probably everything. - [Jesse] She's not just a missing person, Hal. I think she could have been hurt. Would you check it out? - Check what, check what out, a bad dream? Jesse, you were in a car wreck, you hit your head. Honey, you're confused. - Hal, I saw Gloria fighting with that man, before the crash. - You know how crazy that sounds? - Yes. Hal, I don't know what's happening either, but Gloria Hager is missing, that much is real. - I'll see what I can find out. But I want you to do something for me. Go home, get some rest. - How are you feeling? - I'm fine. - So how long have you been having hallucinations? - Not long, a couple of days. - You weren't calling about a patient the other night, you were describing your own symptoms? Okay, you've got two weeks accumulated vacation time, I want you to take it, starting now. - Oh, but Gwen. - No buts. And I want you to let me know if you have any more of these experiences. - So you can assess me, huh? - So I can be your friend. - Gwen, what do you think about ESP? Do you believe it's possible? - Carl Jung did. There is a professor over at Berkeley doing some advanced research in that area, George Brenner. But frankly Jesse, I think your problem is stress. - What about this woman I've been seeing, this Gloria Hager? - Now wait a minute, wait a minute, before we jump into parapsychology, let's come up with something obvious. - She's missing. - Losing your first patient was extremely stressful for you, but you need to let it go. Rest, come on. Don't think about anything connected with work, including Gloria Hager. - Thanks Gwen. - [Gloria] He likes everything under control, and sometimes he loses control. It's not me I'm worried about, I have a daughter. What if something happens to me, I want to make sure she'll be safe. Can you keep her safe? Can anyone keep anyone safe? - You must be Kimberly. You must be Kimberly Hager. I'm a friend of your mother's. - You've never been here before. - No, no I haven't. Are you all right? - Kimberly. - You better leave. I'll get in trouble. - [Admiral] I told you to stay inside. - Are you nuts? If I can be so clinical. - The same man, the same dock, I saw in my mind last night. I'm seeing things that are real, Hal, things that are actually happening. It could mean, Gloria Hager's body is in the bay. - Jesse, the police are working with Naval Investigative Services. If Admiral Hager had something to do with his wife's disappearance, they'll find out. - I saw them fighting. - Well maybe they were fighting. That doesn't mean she's dead. - I saw Hager dump something in the bay. It could have been a body. - And it could be your imagination. - Gloria was frightened of him. She said that sometimes he lost control. - Hey, we all lose control sometimes, including you. It doesn't make us criminals. - They have a child, Hal. - And what's that supposed to mean? - It means that if I'm right, at this moment, that little girl is living with a killer. - All right, I'll talk to someone with Naval Investigations this afternoon. - Then you believe me. - I believe you're seeing something. Don't ask me why. - Thanks, Hal. - Gotta go. - Are you all right? - I saw him. - Who, Jesse? - Hager, he was in this room. - It must have been a bad dream. - What are you doing here? - Well, your phone must have been off the hook. I came to tell you that I talked to my homicide captain. The Naval Investigator will call you tomorrow. Are you gonna be okay? - Yeah. - You want me to stay? - No, I'm fine. - Well, I guess I'd better get going. - Hal? How did you get in? - You want it back? - No, keep it. - Call me tomorrow. - I will. [dramatic piano music] [phone ringing] - Hello? Well yes, of course I'll come out to the base. - [TV Reporter] With still no word on his missing wife, Admiral Hager held a press conference today, offering a $10,000 reward for any information leading to her whereabouts. - Yes, I'm here. Tell Mister Peterson I'll be there at noon. [dark jazz music] - [Jesse] Mister Peterson's office please. - Yes ma'am, right around to your right. - So you are going to file a report. - Of course, we confirmed Missus Hager went to see you. Everything checks out. - Has anyone questioned the daughter? - Naturally, she's distraught. Of course, she believes her mother will return. - I really hope I'm wrong about all this. - Would mind telling me again how you persuaded Captain Armstrong to contact us. Your ex-husband is a policeman? - What does that have to do with anything? - I have to get the details right to file my report. - So you are going to search the bay? - I know you think you saw a body, but isn't it possible you're jumping to conclusions? - Isn't it equally possible that I'm right? - Perhaps not equally, I'll give you possible. - So you will search the bay? - We'll investigate the possibility. Thanks for taking the time to come out here. We'll take charge from now on, Doctor Newman. - It's up to us now Kimberly. We just have to believe that your mother is coming back. - I do, sir. - If we let her down, by thinking for a moment that she's not coming back, then she might not. You know she's all right, don't you? - Yes, sir. - We have to think positively for her sake. Now, tell me what you know in your heart. - She's coming back. - Yes. - It's starting to happen sir, the reward's starting to bring people out of the woodwork. There's a therapist, a Doctor Jesse Newman in San Francisco, Missus Hager went to see her? She said she had a vision of you throwing what appeared to be a body in the bay. - What? That's absurd. - Well, of course it is. The point is, we can't discount the possibility that some harm did come to Missus Hager. - Oh God, Peterson. - I know how you feel about Missus Hager, sir. - I want her back. - We all do sir, but right now I'm concerned about you, sir. - Me? - If Doctor Newman talks to the press, if she convinces the police to regard you as a serious suspect, there may be questions, especially given your recent promotion. - They never leave you alone, do they? - No sir. The press will launch an investigation, the question of the use of unnecessary force in the death of the midshipman may come up. - Naval court ruled that an accident. - I know that sir, I'm just trying to prepare you for the worst. - You said she went to see this therapist. Do you have any idea what they talked about? - No sir, but we'll keep an eye on Doctor Newman. Maybe she's psychic. Maybe she's crazy. But maybe she knows more about your wife than she's telling me. [sharp noise] - I'm sorry, I knocked this over. Doctor Newman? I'm Truman Hager. - What do you want? - Funny, that was my question. What do you want from me? - I want you to leave. - Did Koplin put you up to this? - I don't know what you're talking about. - I'm a decent man. I love my wife, I love my daughter. I would do anything I could to make them happy. Gloria saw you just before she disappeared. What did she tell you? That she loved me, didn't she? I made her happy. Please, I need your help. - I can't discuss Gloria's session with you. - If it was something that I did, I could never forgive myself. This is a very difficult time for me, my wife is missing, there's been no word. Do you have any idea what kind of hell that is? - Of course. - Then why are you making it worse? Don't you realize what you're doing to me, to my daughter, by making these accusations? - I didn't set out to accuse you of anything. I'm only reporting what I saw. - What you saw? What you saw in a vision? In a dream? This is my life you're toying with, my reputation, my little girl. - I'd like you to leave, now. - You can't possibly know how I feel. - I'm sorry about your wife, Admiral Hager. - Then please stop harassing me. - I don't want to harass you. - Then we understand each other. - I got here as quick as I could. - Hal, he was really here. - The other night when you said he was here, he wasn't. Remember, Jesse? - I know he wasn't. That was a vision, this was real. I know the difference Hal, I talked to him. - Then why do you think he came here? - The INS told him what I said. What kind of an investigation is that? Can't you do something? - Well, what can I do? He didn't break in, he didn't hurt you, he just wants you to lay off. I can't bust a national hero for that. - Hal, his daughter is in danger. That's why Gloria came to me. - We need evidence, hard evidence Jesse, evidence from the physical world. - Drag the bay. - You don't ask easy ones do you? He knows where you live. You want to stay at my place? - Oh, I don't think that would be necessary. - Yeah, I know. You don't need anybody to take care of you. - You didn't let me finish. I have a couch, Hal. That's what I was trying to say. - So you do. Did I tell you, that I learned to cook? - Hal, I'd like you to meet Jim Peterson from the NIS. He's here about the Hager disappearance. - We've had an interesting conversation with your ex-wife, Detective Winter. You know she's making some strong accusations against Admiral Hager. - Maybe you should drag the bay for a body, and eliminate that possibility. - I've known Admiral Hager for 10 years, and he is devoted to his wife. You don't mind telling me a little more about your ex-wife, do you Detective? - Of course not. - Did she ever discuss a patient of hers, a woman named Katherine Hopkins? - She never discussed any of her patients. - Katherine committed suicide last week. - [Hal] What's that got to do with Gloria Hager? - Maybe nothing, except Missus Hager was also a patient of Jesse's. How long has Jesse been obsessed with Gloria Hager? - I wouldn't say she's obsessed. - Well, what would you call having hallucinations about someone, convinced you had witnessed their murder? - Look, Jesse was in an auto wreck, maybe she's confused. - According to her, her visions started before the accident. We know that this isn't the first time she's exhibited signs of mental imbalance. Well, thanks for your help. I'll be in touch. Oh, that's the funny thing, I was working on this case a few years ago, and this psychic volunteered to help. She led us straight to the body within eight hours of her coming on the case. You just never know. Good day, gentlemen. - How could you do that? - Just protocol Hal, nothing personal. - I call it covering your ass. You don't think I'd help him nail her? - Yes, yes, if she's involved in this. But you don't think she is, do you? Where was Jesse the night Gloria Hager disappeared? - With me. - All night? - I see you've already made up your mind about this. - Jesse implicated herself. She's the one who went to the NIS and told them she knows where the body is. Maybe you'd better back off. - Since when does this department take orders from the NIS? - Personal feelings cause errors in judgment Hal. - Look, if Jesse's committed a crime, I'll bring her in, but she hasn't. I'd bet my life on that. - Well I hope you're right. [dramatic orchestral music] - Ah, glad you could make it, Detective. - I wouldn't miss it for the world. - Remember that case I told you about, the one cracked by the psychic? I didn't finish the story. The woman who led us to the body, we didn't believe she was a psychic, hell we knew she was a kook. But we took her seriously, then we convicted her, on first degree murder. - The current's fast here. The body wouldn't be around long, unless it got hung up on a pylon. If they haven't found it yet, there's nothing down there. - Then I really am crazy. - Jesse if the body turned up where you said it would, they'd think you were guilty, not crazy. Come on, let's get you home. [yelling from the water] - Hal. [dramatic orchestral music] - I'd like to ask Doctor Newman a few questions. - I've got a personal stake in this case, Russ. - Not anymore. We found this earring on Hager's dock. It's not his wife's, she's a brunette. - Jesse didn't kill her. - The coroner's report fixes the time of death at eight o'clock last Friday night. - Jesse doesn't have a motive, Russ. - Why'd she run Hal? - I don't know what goes through her mind, I never did, but I do know Jesse could never kill anyone. - Hal, two of her patients turn up dead in a week. The way I see it, that's mighty lethal therapy. - Look Russ, the way I see it, a woman's been murdered. Jesse Newman didn't do it, that means somebody else did. She says it's Admiral Hager, she's been right so far. I'm gonna believe her. - I admire loyalty in a man Hal. A man that loyal to his ex-wife, is a man who's gonna be loyal to his job. When you talk to Jesse, advise her to come and see us. Take this earring back to forensics. - Well, if you hear from her, Doctor Singleton, have her call me. - [Cop] One earring. - Jackpot. - Gwen. - Oh Jesse, what the hell are you doing? You almost gave me a heart attack. - They found Gloria Hager's body exactly where I told them they'd find it. The police want to question me, they think I did it. - And you ran? You want them to think that you have something to hide? - I'm sure Admiral Hager killed her. He's setting me up to take the blame. - Okay, come on, let's get you inside. Jesse, the right thing to do is to go to the police. - Kimberly Hager is in danger, and Gloria Hager asked to see me, Gwen, not some other therapist at the clinic, me. Tomorrow I'm going to see that professor you told me about. The parapsychologist. - George Brenner? - Yes. I need to know more about Gloria. I need to know what she meant, not what she said, but what she meant to say. - You're psychoanalyzing a dead woman. - Yeah, in a way, yes I am. So there's no logic or pattern. The visions appear anywhere, any time. What I'm looking for is a way to control the visions, so I can understand what they're trying to tell me. - I'm afraid it doesn't work that way. - Well how does it work? What are the rules? How does something like this happen? - When did these appear? - In a vision. Admiral Hager grabbed my arm. - Extraordinary. - But what does it mean? I mean is Admiral Hager a ghost, who can transport himself physically into my life? - There's a phenomenon known as interpersonal resonance. In folklore, it's known as the calling. It usually occurs between twins. - Cases where one twin will manifest the physical symptoms that his or her sibling is actually experiencing. - They can be in different rooms, or countries for that matter. They can be totally ignorant of one another's circumstance, but still respond physically to one another's pain. - But I don't have a twin. - I am merely suggesting that when Hager grabbed you, he was really grabbing someone else. - I'm seeing through someone else's eyes? Gloria's? - Possibly. - But why wouldn't the visions stop when Gloria died? I barely knew Gloria. And what you're talking about happens between people who are related. - Usually. Sometimes telepathy is triggered by a physical or an emotional trauma. You recently lost a patient to suicide. It may have made you susceptible. [phone ringing] - [Voice On Phone] Hello? - Gwen, I need to talk to you. I'm coming right over. - No, I'm afraid I can't see you this evening. - Is someone there? - Yes, right now. - All right, all right, I'll call you later. Hey Gwen, thank you. [eerie orchestral music] - Kimberly? - It's all right, Daddy. I'm not gonna cry. - [Jesse] Kimberly, July 13th, 1979. - [Jesse On Tape] Is this your first therapy session? Was there a reason why you requested me? - [Gloria] Ken Koplin recommended you. - [Jesse] Who? - [Gloria] Ken Koplin, he's your lawyer. Ken Koplin, he's your lawyer. [dramatic orchestral music] - Mister Koplin? Hello? Oh Hal. - Jesse, are you all right? - Oh no. - I told you to stay inside. We have to stick together sweetheart, especially now. - Who would have wanted to kill her? - There's a woman, some woman the police are looking for. - Why would she do it? - I don't know. She must be very sick. - But, if she killed Mom, why did she tell the police where the body was? - I don't know, I don't know, I don't know. We just, we have to leave that up to the police now. - But she seemed so nice. - When did you see her? - Just the story in the papers. - Outer burns on his head, the gun's in his hand. - Do you think it was suicide? - Someone wants it to look that way. Jess, what were you doing here? - Was Koplin ever your lawyer? - No he wasn't. I'm gonna have to call this in. - Well, when Gloria came to see me, she said she was referred by my lawyer, Ken Koplin. I'd never heard of him. - Jesse, what are you doing? - Hal, he was an adoption lawyer. - Don't touch anything. - I've got to check something out. - Jesse, listen to me. You're only making it worse for yourself. They already think you killed Hager's wife. - You know that's ridiculous. - Jesse, they found your earring on Hager's dock. - I've never been on the dock. - Then how did it get there. - The night Hager came to my apartment. I always leave my earrings on the table. He must have taken one. Hager was here, everything under H is missing. - Jesse, why would Admiral Hager kill this guy? - Look what was written on the back of Kimberly's baby picture. Kimberly was born on the same day our daughter was. - Oh come on, this is insane. - Cooper, Cooper, Cooper was Gloria's maiden name. It was on her patient information form. - July 13th, the day our baby died. This is impossible, we don't know this guy. - Look under your name, Hal. - Our baby's birth certificate. Copeland must have arranged black market adoptions. He could have been blackmailing Hager. - Gloria's last words to me were, if you knew everything, you'd hate me, I'm sorry. I thought she was apologizing for bolting out like that. She was apologizing for something she'd done to us. I remember everything went wrong that day. I was in the doctor's office, and the labor started. - And I was on my way. - He said the baby's heartbeat was dropping. There was no time to get to the hospital. It was just me and the doctor. He gave me a shot, he put me out, and he never showed us the baby. - He told me it would be too traumatic. That you'd get over it faster. Your depression, your breakdown. - All that time I heard her crying, calling to me. - She was. - She's alive, Hal. - My God, Jesse. We have a daughter. - You ever see her, anywhere, you must tell me immediately, do you understand? Let's go back. I have to be able to trust you, Kimberly. We have to share all our secrets. Don't ever let me doubt you. We'll go away for a while, just the two of us, until this is all over. - Kimberly's in trouble. We've got to get to her. At the funeral, she looked at me, and we connected in a way I can't explain. I know Hager has already killed two people. If he thinks he's losing Kimberly, who knows what he might do? - Your mother used to pack for me. It'll be your job now. - Daddy, I don't know how. - Sweetheart it's very simple, everything in its own compartment, lights to darks, Mondays to Fridays. - What if I make a mistake? - If you get something wrong, then you just start over again. I'm gonna go get our passports, I won't be long. You're my big girl, now. - [Hal] The police talked to Kimberly a dozen times, I don't understand why she didn't speak up. - Children often don't. They prefer the hell they know, to the fear of the unknown. - By now they've lifted your prints from that earring. Not to mention, they already want you for questioning in Gloria's death. - Oh please Hal, as soon as we get Kimberly out of there, we'll hand the whole thing over to the police. She's scared, Hal. She's really frightened. [car starting] Let's go, Hal. We don't have much time, we've got to get her out of there. - Are you sure you can get her to trust you? - I hope so. - Okay, I'll watch your back. [door buzzing] - [Kimberly] Yes? - Kimberly, it's Jesse Newman. Please, may I talk to you? - [Kimberly] I'm listening. - I need to talk to you, face-to-face. - My Dad says not to talk to you. - Oh please, Kimberly. You don't know me, but I know you. And I know this sounds very strange, but I've known you for a long time. - You shouldn't have come. - Your mother came to see me on the day before she died. What happened that night, Kimberly? - I don't remember. - Please, try. - I can't. - I know some of what you saw, because I saw it too. - I don't want to see it. - Kimberly, it would be all right. I'm here with you, we'll face it together. - They were fighting. My Mom was really upset. - [Gloria] How long as this been going on? - [Truman] Since I made Admiral. Koplin saw my picture in the paper. - [Gloria] He's been blackmailing you. Were you gonna pay the rest of your life for your dirty secret? - [Truman] Just a holding move, Koplin is a reasonable man. A hundred grand ought to get him back on his feet. - The problem isn't the money, Truman, the problem is what you did. - What I did was make you happy, Gloria. You wanted a baby more than anything, and I gave you a baby. I'll give you anything you want, you know that. - But to steal another woman's child? - What do you care about some woman you never met, until today? You and I and Kimberly, that's all that matters. - It's all built on a lie, and I can't be part of it anymore, and neither can Kimberly. - Did you just get promoted to Admiral? Are you gonna start giving me orders now? - No, but I'm through taking orders. Kimberly and I are leaving. Go to sleep, sweetheart. Momma will be okay. - I shouldn't have left her alone. - Oh no, no no no. How could you know what would happen? - I saw them later. - You are not going to take her. There's nothing left if I lose you. - Truman, stop. - I will not let you leave me. - I never saw him so mad. It was the same thing, the next night. They started fighting again. My mother disappeared that night. - I'm sorry, honey. You're all I've got. I couldn't bear to lose you. - He was crying. He didn't mean to do it. They were fighting over me, it's all my fault. - No, it's not your fault. - He's not my father. She isn't my real mother. - She loved you very, very much. Let's go upstairs and get some of your things together. - Why? - We're gonna take you some place that's safe. Hal? - Good evening, Doctor Newman. Go upstairs Kimberly. - No. - It's for the best, princess. - Go upstairs, sweetheart. - No, I'm not gonna leave you alone with him. - Please, the admiral and I have some things to talk about. It's all right, go on. - Why couldn't you just leave us alone? - Kimberly is my daughter. - How did you know what happened? - I saw everything through her eyes. - Are you a psychic? Can you read my mind? - Kimberly said you didn't mean to hurt your wife. - Gloria was my life. I would have done anything for that woman. - Gloria told me she loved you. - It's all such a pity. - You can go to the police and tell them the truth. - The truth is you're breaking and entering in my property. The truth is, this is classic self defense. - I'm not alone. - Oh, I'm afraid you're very much alone. [alarm blaring] Kimberly? Kimberly? Kimberly? - Kimberly? Kimberly? - [Truman] Kimberly? - I know who you are. - Oh, come on let's go. - You're beginning to get on my nerves, Doctor Newman. Kimberly! - There's another way out, come on, this way. - [Truman] Kimberly! - Hal? Hal? - Step out of the car please, doctor. - Daddy, daddy. - Don't do this, Hager, for her sake, as well as yours. - It's a little late for that. Don't you think? - Daddy no, don't hurt her! I'll go with you. - Hager, it's over. [sirens approaching] [thunder] [sirens approaching] [dramatic orchestral music]
