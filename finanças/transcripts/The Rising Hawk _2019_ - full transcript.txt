Rest, honey. Let's save this. Quiet. Maksim. Yes, mother. I have a gift for you. Wow! It is the same as Ivan's. -You like? -Yes. It is the symbol of our family. Learn to be like your father. Become a good hunter. And bring me something for dinner. Why are you so happy? I've let you win. I already know it. Petro. Petro. What do you think of this? Good quality, huh? Sharp. Lasted. Yes cool. Yes. We will go hunting after the holiday. Okay, next time. Yes. In addition to killing my sheep, his men set fire to my stables. This lack of control has to end. Tugar Volk... You must leave our lands. I can't expel Tugar Volk without first convening the local assembly and listen to what he has to say. Will not show up. He thinks he is above us. I know that you and he are not from Tukhlia, but you fought alongside that man in Kolka. Why don't you make him see reason? That was a long time ago. He is no longer the same man he was then. Maksim. Yes father? Tugar Volk needs a guide to help him hunt a bear that they have seen near these lands. You will lead the hunt and ask him to come to the next assembly. Do it in a way that you agree to come. But, father, I am not the most suitable person for that mission. -Why doesn't Ivan go? -He speaks better than me. It will be done as I say. You will leave in the morning. They say that Tugar Volk's daughter is very pretty. If he is like his father, he will have a face that will frighten wolves. Then you will make a perfect match. Ivan! You talk too much. You will go with him. We will find out together. Aren't you going to ask him? You are going to ask him. I want to see if you are capable. This is very extrange. They don't recognize your authority but they invite you to take them on a hunt? We are disunited. We have lost the union. I will teach you how a leader commands. Stop, stop. We better keep walking from here. I could be hungry and go for the horses. Look. -In the trunk. -Bear scratches. Tell her. Here. So a face that will scare the wolves huh? Run! I'm going for the rest. You're good? Yes. What is your name? Maksim. And you? Myroslava. Are you the guide that helps my father? I'm actually helping my father. We need Tugar Volk to attend our assembly. In Tukhlia. Tukhlia? Maksim? We are fine, Ivan. -You first. -No. Please. Maksim. Thank you. Myro! Myroslava! Where is my daughter? Myro! I'm fine, calm down. You don't touch her. Please help him. Come on, put it down. Let's go. Come on, that's it. If it wasn't for Maksim I'd be dead. -Who? -The. It is called Maksim. Maksim? And what does Maksim want as a reward? -I don't want a reward, sir. -Very good. -We're going home. -Wait, he wants something. Let him say it. What do you want? I ask you, as a man and as a warrior, Attend the Tukhlia assembly on the next full moon. The neighbors there want to talk to you. Why would I go to a commoners gathering? We are free just like you. If you think you're right, come on and show it. There is no reason to hide. I'm not going to take my eye off you, bastard. Father! I will go to that village meeting, because I decide to go. All right. The hunt is over. To home. Sometimes I think God gave me a son. Gard. It seems like a good way to impress him. Well done. Where the hell do you think you're going, young lady? I was going to pick berries. That's what the servants are for. I wanted to take them myself. No way. I can never go anywhere. I haven't even been to Tukhlia, I think it's called. Those people live submissive. Myro. Those people are fighting against me for our lands. They don't respect me. And if you turn your back on those people, -They will stab you with a dagger. "And why did one of them save me?" My daughter is not going out to pick berries! Get yourself another hobby if you want to do something! In bed, young lady To the bed. I love you No no no no! It's me, Maksim! Sorry, Myroslava. But have you gone crazy? I almost died of fright! I didn't know how to mislead your servants. Come on down. It was the only way to enter. -Myro! What happened? You're good? -Is nothing! -I've seen a rat! -Open, the guards will kill her. No, no, it's already gone! I'm going to bed! Goodnight! -Sure you're okay? -Yes, sure! -Goodnight. -Goodnight! -What are you doing here? -Invite you to our holiday. Tonight. -A holiday? -Yes. It is a celebration in honor of Perun. It is the biggest party we have. We will sing and dance and there will be mead and exquisite dishes. And we will build a huge bonfire that... You have to see to believe, but you can see it from all over the valley. Sneaking in here to invite me to that is stupid. I do not know what I was thinking of. Sorry for bothering you. Is this going well? Yes. Everyone will look at you. Very good. Very well, are you going to come? How do you plan to get out of here without my father seeing us? Mother father. This is Myroslava. -Myroslava, this is my mother, Rada. -Nice to meet you. Equally. - It is a pleasure that you are here. -Thank you. -And this is my father, Zakhar. -Nice to meet you. Your son saved me this morning. So we have three things to thank the gods for: Maksim's heroism, the festival that has begun -and your life. -She killed the bear. -And this one here is my uncle Korhun. -It is a pleasure. Is beautiful. Yes, she is beautiful, Uncle Korhun. Like you, yes. Why don't you go for more mead? Yes, mead! Where have they put it? My brother has to be around. Do you have brothers? I wish I had them. There is. I remember seeing him on the hunt. Sometimes he punches me but for my own good. I don't know what I would do without him, honestly. It reminds me of a party my father threw for my mother when I was little. Everyone sang and danced. My parents danced all night. My mother was wearing a white dress and flowers in her hair. What happened to your mother? Sorry. Nothing happens. I didn't want to make you feel uncomfortable. Let's go? Where? To dance. Come on. Look. -Are you having a good time? -If much. Be good to my son. Is beautiful. It is an offering to our guardian. The Sentinel Rock, do you see it? -It is a giant that protects the valley. -A giant? -That's what the legend says. -What is the legend? Well, long ago, good giants ruled these lands, and the goddess of death, Morana, cursed them. Made everything in the water die and all the life of the place disappeared. Animals, trees... Only the rocks remained. The mighty king of giants, seeing him, he took a huge mallet and hit the rock causing a huge bang that tore it apart and broke the spell. And life arose again. Of course, Morana was enraged. He let out a piercing scream who turned the king of giants to stone. But, whatever he did, I could never reverse the beauty that had sprouted. So my ancestors decided to live here. Now I do see it. And if Morana returns one day, the king will awaken from his torpor and will protect us from his anger once again. You have a deep love for this place. And I understand why. I have to return. I'll be back soon. - Take care of yourselves. -We will do it. It was a joy to see you, Uncle Korhun. Have a nice trip back. Good luck with your sister. You know how much he likes to talk on trips. I heard you. Do not worry. I have plenty of mead to soothe my ears. Goodbye. It was a pleasure to see you! Done. Have you seen Maksim? There it comes. -Mother, sorry for being late. -I hope you had a good time last night. -Buchon, say goodbye to your mother. -Sweetie. Goodbye my love. -It gives memories of me. -I will do it. -Take care of your brother. -I will do it. Good trip. See you soon. Goodbye. Than? Than? Oh yeah. Hunt. Yes, yes, we will go. We'll go. Yes. Yes. No, I am not hungry. Its busy. Occupied. Yes, busy entertaining a girl. There is nothing here. Let's go. Oosta, Oosta! For! What do you do? It's me, Maksim. Nothing happens. -Maksim. -Yes, it's me. -Nothing happens. -Nothing happens. There is no danger. What happened? Got damn. Demons on horseback. What the hell? And the others? When we reach the town of Korhun, everything was devastated. There was nothing left. I narrowly escaped And I couldn't see what happened to your mother or your wife. Sorry. Do you think you can go back to Tukhlia alone? Go and tell my father what you have told us, understand? Come on, go. Run. Uncle Korhun! Ivan! Your mother. Rosanna. -They've taken them. -Who took them? No. There is no time to bury them. The gods will understand it. -What are we waiting for? -Be patient. There are two guards guarding the town. We will enter from the east. Just swords. Fast and noiseless. Let's go. You have to choose. Who is going to die? The? Me? Me first, huh? I first. Do not be afraid. I've already been dead. You just have to aim well. It touched you, how lucky. You beat me. You won, very well. Go ahead, young man. Hurry up Let's go. Leave them alone. -Rosanna, protect the others. -It's your turn! -Do not touch me! -No! -Rada! Leave her, please! -Shut up. Please! -Shut! -We have not done anything! Maksim, you go after our mother. Petro and I will help the others. Let's go. Let's go. Come here. Come. Hey, I propose a challenge! Hey? I want to tell you something. Do you accept the challenge? You are one of those who tried to kill me and you all failed. It could be you. You could be lucky. Quick, Petro. Come on, accept the challenge! Kill me first! Kill me! Do it now! Come on! It is weak to kill a woman! Cowards! Be a man! Go with Petro and be safe. Let's go. Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Let's go! Do it! -Mother. Don't worry, we're already here. -Come on, help me. Come on, lend me a hand. -You're good? -Come on, let me go. -Thank you. -Here, huh. Let's go! No! -Mother, are you okay? -You have to go for the others. We have already done it, they are with Petro. -It was time. Come on. -Shut! Maksim. Run! -Let me see. -No! We don't have time, we have to go. Take her to our den. I will save time. Run. -See you in the caves. -Go away. -I stay with you. -Let's go. We are almost there. Keep going. Go with my family. I am coming right away. Here! What are you doing? I'm going to hunt Mongols. What do you say? There are many. It would be suicide. You know what? I do not care. This must be finished properly. If you go out, you will endanger those of us here. -You can't stop me. -Please. Maksim, quickly, your mother. Come. Maksim. What happens? I can't stop the bleeding. When we arrived he was already dead. Sorry, my Khan. Leave me. Do you smell that The stench of pagan pigs. Villagers of Tukhlia, I have come here today, but... not because you called me. I came here, -for own will. - Be that as it may, we celebrate your arrival. I'd tell you, I'm glad to see you, Zakhar, but we both know it would be a lie. If I imagine it. Look, that's the writing that your leader designates me. I am the lord of all these lands. Do you think that parchment will make us respect you? You are forcing us into an agreement that we have not accepted. Don't you think it would be wrong that, without asking your permission, I will snatch the sword from your hands and give it to my children? The Mongol army is coming upon us. I'm here to give your people the protection you couldn't give your wife. I leave you here to your own luck. In front of the Mongols. -Let's go. -Let the gods decide. If you win, you can stay in Tukhlia and we will obey your laws. You will obey them. But also... your children... They will serve as slaves in my house. But when we win, you will go to Gallich and recruit more men to fight shoulder to shoulder with us against the Mongols, as equals. Do you accept I agree. Gard! Father, I know you will choose Ivan, but please take me. -Are you sure what you do? -Let the gods decide. Ahead. Use his size against him. Done deal. What do you say? There is no deal. I have shed blood across these lands in over twenty battles. And do you think I'm going to abide by an agreement of commoners? The warrior I knew would never allow his honor to be lost. You're a liar? And a coward? The warrior I knew wouldn't spend the day cleaning shit like a farmer! I'll bring you an army from Gallich and we will fight shoulder to shoulder. If you still can, old man. Get up! Thank you, Tugar. Bring provisions! You have to be prepared for what is to come! It wasn't as impressive as beating a bear but you didn't count on my help. -You've been here the whole time. -Yes. They told me about your mother. I am so sorry. I'm glad you met her. Your mother was like mine. Good and loving. Bring me the weapons! I have to go before my father sees me. See you soon. For all we know, the safest path in the west is here or here. We are short of supplies and reinforcements. The mountainous area is difficult to cross for us. However, if we cross the valley, we will not find resistance. We believe that the amulet proceeds from one of the towns from the mountainside. We will cross... the mountains. -Merke. -Yes, my Khan. Recruit your men. Register those towns. Find the one responsible. Tugar Volk. -What happened? -The Mongols are approaching. Tugar Volk and Myroslava resist, but they won't last long. -How many? -About twenty. Maybe less. -Myroslava. -Find your brother and go. Where are everybody? They were here when I left. They must be inside. -Ivan! Too many! -Get in the house! Come on, quick! To the house! Bohun, stop! Calm him down! Take cover! Lock the windows! At least here we are comfortable. Better to die like this. Listen to me! You are warriors! And you have proved it! But you have killed the only son of the Khan! Will not stop... even see you dead. Sacrifice yourselves... and you will save your families. I beg you. There is no time left. And I swear that I... I will protect the people of Tukhlia. Die, you traitorous pig! Burn them. They want to get us out. We have the wind in our favor. Let's use the smoke to attack them now. Maksim is right. Prepare yourselves. -What do you do? You are ours! -I'm not one of you, paleto. Die bastard! For! Stop! You and your men are from Tukhlia. Fight with us. Maksim. Maksim! You are injured? Here, your ax. Let's go. Maksim, no! My special arrows. Go for those men! Kill them! Play. Take the archers. -Bring the heads of those assassins. -Yes, my Khan. Follow me! Shoot! High! We have killed most, my Khan. And the two brothers? I will bring my entire army to the top of the Carpathian Mountains. I will burn everything that is valuable to you. You will guide me. So maybe it won't end your miserable life. My dear daughter. Tugar Volk has allied with the Mongols. -They shouldn't be too far away. -Ivan! Quick! Let's take it inside. It is the effect of some kind of poison. My son, my son. Petro, his son Bochan. Come on! My wife. I'm so sorry, my son. Don't suffer, father. The gods will welcome me. It has been an honor, brother. Live your life. It's your turn. What happened? Ivan. Nerd. Do not suffer, my love. -Do not suffer. -My love. Do not leave Me. -Please. -I promise... that we will see each other... in the other world. Bochan. Don't cry, my son. Do not Cry. Be strong. Protect your mother and our family. there is nothing more important. Do not suffer. I will always be with you. -Maksim, wait. -How?! How could you have spent your whole life without knowing what your father is like? How do you want me to trust you? Years ago, a man turned up at our home in Gallich. I have never seen my father so scared. I didn't understand then, but today, Noticing its horrible stench in my house, I have known. I know it was him. Burunda Khan. Our mothers deserve the fight. My brother would have wanted this to be yours. He was a man of honor. I didn't want this to happen to my family or yours. You have already fulfilled. Your family needs you. Go back home. To home? I have no home. You know? My precious woman and my daughter, only seven years old, they are already living with the gods. So before I meet them, I will finish this mission. We'll both finish it. Dear friends and respected neighbors. There's very little time left, our watchers have confirmed that the Mongolian army rides towards us. They won't stop until they've killed us all. They outnumber us, there are thousands! We have to run away! It is the only way to survive. Even if we were already leaving, his horses would overtake us. Then what? I have a possible solution. We can take it all and leave Tukhlia on the other side of the mountain. When we have all crossed it, we will tear down the Sentinel Rock and we will break the dam to create a water barrier between us and the Mongols. And where will we get the time? They are too close. A group of us will contain them. The entrance to Tukhlia is narrow. If we gather all of our warriors at that point, we can stop the mongolian army and buy time for others to escape. Now you have to choose. Abandon who is next to you and save you or stay together protecting each other and fight for what really matters. -We will fight! -We will fight! We will fight! -We will fight! -We will fight! -We will fight! -We will fight! I haven't thanked you. Why? For saving my life. For the second time. You didn't give them to me the first time either. It is true. Thank you. Myro, Since the first time I saw you... It will be a privilege to die with honor. And if we are to die today, we will do it as warriors. -It will be a pleasure to die for you. -Yes! Drop at my signal! Already! Tear those assassins apart! Attack! Now! Withdrawal! Bohun. Bohun! -Have we already won? -You're good? Did you think those Mongols were going to be able to with me? My Khan! Each villager fights with the energy of ten. We must modify the plan and withdraw from the mountain. Play. Take command. I want to destroy that town before dark. -We are ready. -Notice the others. We will prepare the dam. There is no one left in Tukhlia! We have to go! Maksim! Run! Take her. Run. Run. Come on, go away. Destroy the dam. Very good. To your posts. For Maksim! I will find your loved ones and you will see me butcher them as if they were cattle. And so, you and I will share the same pain. Merke, Burn it all! Take my personal guard and go ahead. Find out how many villagers are left. Let's go! Let's go! Don't let those villagers throw the rock. Kill them! Pull! Pull! I'll be right back. The rock! Run! Quick! You have done this! Wait! Above. Zakhar! We want you to make way for us. And I will forgive your son. Myroslava, give me your bow. Kill him! Father! -Father. -Son, I knew... -that you would get it. -Don't waste your strength. Our town is safe. Your mother would be proud of you. And I also. Myroslava, take good care of my son. Ivan and Mother are waiting for you.
