FATHER OF EDUCATION RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEATH OF 40 CHILDREN Sir, why did you publish this news? The entire town knows that they're very dangerous. Sathyamoorthy, you've published plenty of breaking news. But I'm quite scared about this piece of news. Don't forget that you have a family to look after. Why can't you just publish gossip and simple news? Ravi, people don't believe no matter what anyone says. But they believe when a journalist has something to say. It's our duty to respect people's trust. Give the shutter keys to the guard. -Don't worry. -Inform him about it. -Quickly load them all. -Did you lock up the gate? See you tomorrow. Sathyamoorthy, one minute. -Tell me, sir. -In life, diplomacy is important. We can't deal everything in a straightforward way. Sometimes, honesty can be your biggest enemy. Please be careful. It's for your own good. Mom, my baby sister is saying something. Maara, there's a baby boy just like you in my womb. Mom, it's a baby girl. Hey, I want another handsome son like you. Dad is here. Let's ask Dad's opinion. Go ahead. Dad! Mom! Mom! Ask him. -Wait, I'll ask. -Come on, ask him. I will! Dear... Listen to him what he has to say. Maara, what's your problem? Dad, Mom says it's going to be baby brother. But I wish for a baby sister. So, you tell me what you wish for. Why do you wish for a baby sister? I am like you. We need a baby sister to be like Mom. He has got a point though. -What do we want? -Baby sister! Maara, bring me your plate. Maara, don't eat. Hold on, here I come. I got your favourite, chicken fritters and gravy to have with the rice cakes. Now that's what you call the love of a maternal uncle. Just being a sibling doesn't make one a good maternal uncle. Come on, don't start again. Amudha, same goes to you. Sit down and eat. -Here you go. Have this! -Brother, you too join us for dinner. No, dear, today is an auspicious day. I have many clothes to press. I'll take my leave. Listen, an important thing. Today, I took Amudha for a check-up. The doctor said she might go into labour anytime. So, take a break from saving the world and tend to your household duties. As you say, Mr. Astrologer. You always keep pulling my leg. I'm taking my leave. -I have a lot of work. -He left without having dinner. Dad! Dad! Dad, you chose baby sister for my sake, right? No, son. Dad, what are you thinking about? Come on. Maara, I'll ask you something. You have to answer. Sure, Dad. There's an uncle who's not an honest man, and because of that 40 children just like you are dead. Only I know the truth about the case. If I hide the truth, only that uncle will benefit from it. But if I expose the truth, it'll benefit everyone. Now tell me what I should do. You have to speak the truth! That's what I did. -Morning, it'll be in the newspapers. -Awesome, Dad! Maara, bear this in mind. It's important to stay righteous in your life. But being smart is the most important thing. The righteous path you choose might put your loved ones in danger. Only your smartness will save them. I want you to be not just righteous but smart too. -Will you? -Definitely, Dad! Is this Dina Anjal reporter Sathyamoorthy's house? -Where is he? -This is his house. His wife went into labour, so they just left for the hospital. It seems they just left. We can easily catch up to them. -Start the car! -Who are you people? Oh, God! Hey, it's an emergency, and you've blocked the road. Step aside! Just because you gathered evidence doesn't make you a big shot. Where is the evidence? You can't write whatever you want! Where's the document? Please listen... We're running out of time. She's in labour. No one can leave without giving up the document. Please step aside and let us go. Kumaresa, please take Amudha to the hospital. -I'll handle them. -Sathyamoorthy, hear me out. They have a problem with me. I'll handle them. You go. I'm coming, dear. Maara, come with me. No, I won't come. I'll stay with Dad. Maaran and I will come home safe. Go! Okay, be careful. Fine, drive, let's leave. Brother... I can't bear the pain! Hey, where the hell is the document you took from the school? Let me go! No! Brother, please let go of me. Sir, you're blessed with a baby girl. Dad, behind you! Dad! We tried our best, but we could not save the mother. Oh, dear God! MAARAN Son, please drink some water. How long do you plan to stay like this? Please drink some water. -Aren't you hungry? -Let's go, Maara. Maara, you know that your aunt has no child of her own. She has asked to adopt your sister. Since your uncle is not well-to-do... they could afford to raise only one child. I'll take care of you. You can stay with me. You see... the two of us are not capable of taking care of a child. Uncle, this is my sister. She's like my mother. I'm going to be her mother and father. I will raise my sister! ♪ You are like a mother's lap Singing lullaby to your brother ♪ ♪ You are a lovely flower Who is dear to me ♪ ♪ You are like the moon Cannot miss seeing you ♪ ♪ Years may pass by You speak the language of a kid ♪ ♪ Have I been lucky to see Your twinkling eyes? ♪ ♪ The life I have got Is the only for you ♪ ♪ I call myself your guard And walk with you ♪ ♪ But in reality You are my support ♪ ♪ Beautiful flower you are My dear ♪ We've placed a plate inside your sister's arm.

Greetings, Chief! As today is an auspicious day, I went to file the nomination. But you summoned me out of nowhere. We've gathered here to discuss if you should contest in the elections. Chief, what's happening? Earlier you were infamous among the press. But now even the public doesn't like you. It's an embarrassment if the ruling party loses in by-elections. Do you even know the person who made the by-elections happen? Only the chief and I are aware of it. You mentioned a journalist with an audio evidence. You told me you'll handle everything and there will be no problem. -Now the party is in trouble. -Chief, there won't be any problem. Chief, this is my own constituency. My self-respect is at stake. If I don't contest in this election, my political career will end. I will win this election and prove everyone wrong. I will make sure I don't bring down our party's name. Trust me. Hey, you! You keep hopping from one party to another. How dare you question my integrity? I'll handle you after I win the elections. I'll take my leave, Chief. They're here. Sir, someone else has been chosen to contest in the elections. Then why are you here to meet the chief? Sir, why did you return half-way without filing the nomination? Sir, what's your opinion on journalist Maaran's tweet? Is it true that you were part of the voting machine scam? -Don't ask unnecessary questions! -Calm down. The party has chosen me to contest. On the way to file the nomination, I stopped to get the chief's blessings. This is the truth that you need to publish. -They'll change the tone of it. -Let's go. -Sir, sir, sir, please answer. -Publish as told. -Sir, please. Sir, please stop. -Hey, step aside! -Sir, please answer. -They've become a nuisance. -Step aside, damn it! -Sir, please stop. -Step aside! -Sir, please. - Sir! - Brother... a drunkard journalist's news has created a huge problem. If we stick to the Chief's principles, we won't survive. We'll recover the evidence from Maaran and kill him off. Hey, start the car. Where is he? Look, he's right here. Hey, get up, damn it! Hey, wake up. Wake up! He's not responding. Bloody hell! It's not working. Give me that bottle. Hey, where's the evidence? Hey! Hey! How dare you beat up a police officer? Take him away! How dare you get drunk and beat up a police officer? Peg yourself to be a big shot, huh? Wait and watch what I do to you. -You'll never do this again. -Bharath, stop it! What are you doing? Do you even know who that is? He was drunk and beat up a police officer. Shut up! Maaran! Maaran? Maaran! Maaran! I will sue you. I will bloody sue you! Hey. Hey... Maaran! Maaran, over here. Over here. Maaran, what happened? Maaran, what happened? Maaran! Maaran, what happened? Maaran! -Hey, auto! -Help! Call that auto. Get him over here. -Hurry up. -Help! Maaran! Hey... Hey, Maaran. Maaran! A FEW MONTHS AGO God, my brother is a lazy goose. Pegs himself to be a genius but an utter fool. Please help him to get a job this time. Dad, you left me with a good-for-nothing. Bloody buffalo, wake up! You have an interview in an hour. You can't stick to one bloody job. You were fired 10 times already. There's no point in being honest. -Get lost. -Oh, God! I don't write for the sake of it. I write to bring a change. Your dad used to say the same thing. Remember what happened to him? It's scary whenever you speak this way. If something happens to you, who'd take care of me? Oh, really? Be a good sister and serve your brother. Understood? Fine, go take a shower and get ready. -Don't you have a business to run? -I do, and you better mind yours. Uncle, would you like to have breakfast? I'll have it later, dear. I knew that you came to eat. One stop shop for exercising needs... Acme Fitness! In just 12 days, we guarantee a reduced waist size. All you need to do is very simple. -SMS 57676 and place the order. -Disgusting! Hey, Maara, stop right there! All the best. If you get this job, I can finally buy the earrings I wanted. Right! I'm attending interviews to buy you earrings. It's better you control your diet. Bloody glutton. Can't believe you're modelling. -Bloody pig! -Bloody drum! Why do you bother yourself with these things? I don't mind. -Here you go. -What is this? -Pocket money. -Oh-oh! -Here you go. -What is this? Your pocket money. Just because you're grown up, you don't need it? I was a child back then, but now I'm grown up. To me, you're always a child. It's better that you take care of my sister. I know what to do. Off you go. Off I go, sir! Just like his father. -I sent the photos. Please follow up. -Okay, done. -Hey! -Don't you have any sense? Don't you have any manners bumping into me like this? Just kidding. Beauty married a beast. Lucky guy. You should be saying what he said. Okay, the name is Rajesh, right? Send him over. I'll sort it out. Okay. Do you have a bubble gum? You don't understand Tamil? Bubble gum. Bubble gum. Maybe she's hard of hearing. Mr. Mathimaaran, please come in. -Good morning, sir. -Hi, please sit down. Thank you. -Meet Mr. Kesavan. He's the M.D. -Hello, sir. -I'm Aravindhan. Senior Journalist. -Hello, sir. Mathimaaran. You're too young. But you've already worked 7 different jobs. Sir, how do I say it... I write the truth as it is. I don't care for authorities. And that makes many uncomfortable. Eventually, I get fired. His arrogance is toxic. If we hire him, we'd end up with legal issues. Sir, we've been sued many times. -Aravindhan... -Sir! Okay, there are 3 topics on the screen. If you were to publish, which topic would you choose? Instagram star trolled by netizens. Ex-minister's controversial video leak. Popular actress pregnant before marriage. Sir, I wouldn't choose any of it. Oh, you say that nothing is interesting? No, sir, they're all very negative. It's imperative to publish negativity. Negative news has to be published. A heroine goes on a vacation abroad. We'll have to pap them and post pictures. Any kind of romance should be projected as an illegal affair. The news might be positive. But the caption should be negative. Only then the public will click on the link to read. Your idea of positivity... Sir, by publishing negative news all the time... we've turned the world into a negative place. Actually, if we report the right things and publish honest news, people will like it. Positive news work too. Yes, sir. -Listen... -Yes? I'm going to pick one among the three topics... -and tweet on the company's site. -Okay, sir. The positive reporting you mentioned... Pick one of the topics and tweet on the company's official site. 15 minutes time. I'll get 10,000 likes for the post. If you get 5,000 likes... you're hired. If you don't... You questioned my seniority, right? Apologise to me and leave. -Aravindhan. -Sir. It's unnecessary. Sir, he has a point. Before you hire me, I should prove myself. Okay, sir, let's do it. -Live-stream both the tweets. -Okay. -Here, use my laptop. -Thank you, sir. Your hands are shivering. Yes, sir. I'm nervous. Okay, fine. Guys, something about our college has been published. Hey, did you check out Maaran's tweet? Go to the reception. There'll be a person called Rajesh waiting. Okay, sir. Sir. Your hands are shivering.

Chittu! Where were you? I got promoted, so I threw a party. How did you manage that? I didn't have any money, so I used your savings. Do you have any sense? My dear sister! I'm your brother, not some random person. I raised you like a mother, dear. -I am your mother. -I was saving to buy earrings. Okay, you were saving to buy earrings. It's not like you were saving to buy a house. I'll buy you earrings when I get my salary. Why are you making a fuss? I want it today. Can you do it? I can't. You're a fool. Your savings turned into booze. Are you my father to question me? Tell me? Are you my father? That was my money. Not yours. It's good manners to ask before you take someone else's money. I was just pulling your leg. But you went overboard. Eat. Here you go. I bought this bike for you. So, you were saving to buy me a bike? That's why you were upset. Okay. Thanks for standing up for me. I was waiting for someone like you. What? For this office... we need someone like you. -Hello! -Hello, Maaran. This is Arjun. -Hey, Arjun, how are you? -I'm fine. It's been long. After college, we never met. Are you free? Maaran, I need to meet you. -Can you come to T. Nagar in an hour? -Okay. I need to discuss something important. I'll share the location. -Okay. -I'll see you there. Okay. Hello, Inspector. It's been long. How are you? Don't call me Inspector. Address me as you did in college. In college, I used to... -Dude, stick to Inspector. -Thought as much. -Who is this? -She's my assistant. I need to speak in private. Brother, leave and keep a lookout. -Off you go. -Oh? Come on, go. Be prompt with work. -No, I quit. -Okay. I've been closely following your work. You're bold. You're gutsy. You keep publishing the truth without fearing the consequences. -I respect that. -Thanks. I'll get to the point. My friend is a police officer too. He shared information that an ex-minister is about to pull off a huge scam. After a week, he went missing. We looked for him. But he vanished. Maaran, I know he's in great danger. And maybe it's already too late. See, my point is, after that, I started following the minister. A meeting is about to take place at his hotel tomorrow. I got intel that in that meeting, to discuss the scam, a broker is arriving from North India. Okay. What do you expect me to do? I want you to do a sting operation and help me expose what's happening at the hotel. Cigarette. You're from the police. Why can't you do it yourself? The answer is in your question. I'm from the police. It's not easy for the police to get closer to the politicians. I have to follow a lot of rules and protocols. But you don't have to. I'll tell you what. We'll work together. I'll provide you with all the intel you need. And you get me the evidence I need. It's a huge risk, Maaran. I can understand your intention. Enthusiasm comes with being young. But I'm concerned. Sir, we have to do it. Someone has to do it. How long do we let the authorities oppress us and blindly follow whatever they say? Sathyamoorthy lost his life to journalism and truth. Your father. I had interviewed him. You remind me of him a lot. That's why I'm very scared. What's the plan? Yes! -Dude. -Tell me. I diverted all the calls from Pazhani's room to yours. Okay. Now all the calls from that room will be received only by you. Very good. Awesome. -Now it's your game. -Shut up and hang up. Greetings, sir. -Sit down. -Sir. -Is this the machine? -Yes, sir. Hello, room service. I'm calling from room 1107. -One chilli chicken. -One chilli chicken. -One French fries. -One French fries. One full bottle of Jameson whiskey. One bottle of Jameson whiskey. -Your order will take 30-45 minutes. -Okay. Hello, room service. -Thank you, ma'am. -Okay. Maaran, take care, okay? Stop right there. I'll take it from here. You may go. -I asked you to leave. -I have to go this way. -Hey, ask him to leave. -I'll take it from here. Sir, it's manufactured in Mumbai. Sir, the technology has advanced a lot. Even if it's complicated tech, we can manufacture it in India. -At present-- -I've heard enough. They say tampering with the EVM machine is not possible. Everyone has the same opinion. I shouldn't look like a fool. Sir, we cannot tamper the machine that is used. But if we insert a microchip in it, we can control it externally. That's what we're going to do. I'll show you a sample, sir. Hey, no need. It's better for both of us to not know more than this. The payments I made earlier were only an advance. If you prove that it can be tampered, I'll give you the contract for the Parliamentary elections. -I guarantee it. -Sure, sir. Sir, as we said earlier, the machine is our responsibility. But please be careful to pick the right person to switch the machines. Sure, don't worry about it. Can we trust him? We can trust him. He'll do it promptly. He's wearing a hearing aid. Okay, pick it up. Don't be in a hurry. You better give it a thought. We're reporting the truth, so there's no room for doubt. Today's headlines. Early this morning, near the R.M. Nagar bus stand, -fake EVM machines were found. -Increase the volume. As the elections are around the corner, this incident has caused a frenzy among the public. The day before yesterday, following the news published by The News reporter Maaran, Rangaraj Pandey is live with us to talk about the incident. Greetings, sir. Electronic Voting Machines can't be easily tampered. It's similar to a calculator. Whichever number you click it'll display that number. Many politicians and technicians have challenged to tamper it. But it has been proved in the Supreme Court that it can't be tampered with. What the hell is happening? I thought you were experienced. You may have lost in your own constituency. I thought you'll use by-elections to your advantage and win. But you've been clowning around. Chief, don't get me wrong. I have nothing to do with it. Who are you trying to fool? Who the hell is Maaran? He claims to hold audio evidence. He's a two-cent journalist. I'll get the situation under control. Many countries, including those in Europe, have failed to do it. Bharath Electronics Ltd., an Indian company, has produced the Electronic Voting Machine for the Election Commission. It can't be tampered with at any cost. Sir, you explained it in detail with much clarity. Thank you very much. In the coming days, updates from Maaran of The News will definitely attract public attention. Dude, you nailed it! -Yes, you nailed it. -Okay, chill! Thank you. Yes! Yeah, yes, yes! Come on! -Congrats, bro. -Thanks, bro. Thank you. -Thank you. -Sir, you were awesome. Sir, thank you, sir. Don't get too excited. It's not good for you. Sir, I just started dancing. I didn't earlier. Look, I'm dancing now. -You'll realise one day. -Oh, is it? What would that be? Sir, please tell me. Sir! He got mad! He got mad! -Wassup? -What are you doing? Cardio. An upcoming actress has hired me for a photoshoot. -Okay. -It's a small portfolio. It's nearby. Could you help me with it? I don't know anything about photography. I won't be of help. Like, carrying the lens bag... holding thermocol or reflectors. I'm a popular writer. And you want me to hold reflector. Not a chance. -Is it? Okay. -Hold on. You came to me for help. I always help when someone's in need. Let's go. Where's the actress? She's nowhere to be seen. She should be here any minute. I'm a successful writer. But you've brought me here and wasting my time. Nonsense! Wow, such a shameless show-off! It's wrong to stay modest. It's wrong to show off too. I'm finding it hard to understand people. It's not wrong to show off talent. Here she comes. -So, she's the actress. -Yes, do you know her? I don't know her. I was just enquiring. Cool! -Hi. -Hi, ma'am. -All ready? -Yes, ma'am. Everything is ready. Keep it glamorous. Only then it'll attract more likes on Instagram. Yeah, of course! Maaran, get the things out. Hi, madam. -You! -Do you know him? No. I was asking if he's your assistant. Yeah. I'll pay you Rs. 5,000. Please co-operate. Maaran, hold the reflector close to her. The face should look brighter. No matter what I do, her face looks the same. -Maaran! -Hey, the breeze was strong. It was not intentional. I couldn't help it. Sorry. Sorry, madam. Listen, have you acted in films or series? I don't remember seeing you in anything. I have done a lot of ads. I watch a lot of TV. But never have I seen you. Perhaps I never appeared on your TV. Oh, really? Maaran... Are you crazy? Don't be disrespectful. Please behave yourself. Awesome, madam! SEMMOZHI POONGA Madam, I have a sister too. A complete glutton! She eats all the time and has turned into a drum. On top of all that, she wishes to be a model. -Once I get home today... -Sorry, bro. ...she'll be in for it. In the morning, I asked you for money to pay for this shoot. Had I asked, you may have not approved. That's why I lied to you. Where's the money? This is my brother. What the fu... Once paid is paid. I've clicked pictures. Non-refundable. I can't believe that you are siblings. -I feel that way too. -Excuse me. Step aside. We need to talk. Being a celebrity writer, I have to deal with all of it. People keep asking to take pictures. Come back later. It's not that. You better step aside. Are you here to fight? I don't have to do anything to show off my grit. They always take care of it. Come, buddy, let's play. Hey, you've gone overboard. You keep writing as you please. You have locked horns with big shots. You have important evid-- Start the fight, you moron! Your brother knows to fight? He raised me. To protect me during our childhood, he learnt to fight. Brother! Let go. Let go! -Shwetha! -Oh, God! Hey, Shwetha. Are you okay? Come on, guys, let's go. What happened? It's just a small injury. Don't move your hand. Keep it down. Is this why you called us a million times? Clean the wound and put a bandage. Let the doctor say it. No need. A tetanus shot would suffice. No, no, let the doctor say it. -You don't prescribe anything. -I said the doctor is busy. Listen, who gave them a wheelchair? What's happening? Doctor! Doctor, this is my sister. Her hand is injured. Okay. During childhood, she fell down and fractured her hand. There's a steel plate in her arm. She doesn't get it. Okay, I'll check. Please come, ma'am. Let's go. -She has a plate-- -I said I will check. What kind of hospital is this? They don't even ask for the patient's medical history. Don't worry. It's a small injury. She'll be fine. I think no one gets what I'm saying. It's better I check out myself. She's not the only person who got hurt. Look even I'm hurt. Hey, don't compare yourself with her. There's a full-size plate inside her arm. She can't even bear the burn of an antiseptic. You have no idea. Only I know because I raised her. Enough worrying about me. They came to beat you up. Do you realise that? Let's go. He'll be ranting nonsense. What did the doctor say? Do you need to take pills? Uncle, I'm very scared. I've heard bad things about Minister Pazhani. Today he sent his henchmen and it became an issue. Maaran doesn't seem to understand. Why don't you speak to him? What do I tell him? He's just like his father. No one can control him. If a person makes a mistake, we can reform him. When a person does the right thing, how could we call it wrong? Perhaps if he gets married, his wife can straighten him out. I think a girl at the office likes Maaran. A girl loves Maaran? -What's wrong with my brother? -Nothing, my dear. -Nothing! -She's coming home tomorrow. Let's wait and watch. Thank you. Who are you? Are you here to meet someone? Mathimaaran. I work with him. Oh, this is his house. Please go inside. Hi. Hi. -What is this? -A gift. Do you think liquor bottle is an appropriate gift when you visit someone's house for the first time? It's okay. Come in. Are you in love with my brother? -Are you in love with my brother? -Yeah. -Have you proposed yet? -Not yet. We're going out of town to cover an event. -I'll tell him then. -Oh! -What if he turns you down? -I'll move on to another guy. Brilliant. See, I have some questions for you. If you answer them correctly... I'll think about letting this nonsense happen. -Okay? -Okay. Question number 1. Your father is not well. At the same time, my brother is sick too. -Who will be your priority? -My father-- Your brother. Your brother! Question number 2. -Superstar Ajith or Superstar Vijay? -What? What has that got to do with love? Just answer the question. I'm not answering this question. Clever. Question number 3. You must've noticed that he does all the chores. Once you get married, you'll have to take over the chores. Okay? Won't you do the chores? Hello! You're getting interviewed not me. Okay. That's our father. He exposed a huge school scam, so they killed him. It's my brother who raised me. Just like the heroes from old movies, he completed his education while working. He also provided me with education. A hero indeed. Hey, I've been calling you to dry the clothes... -Hey, what brings you here? -Hey, get lost! -Hey, she's my colleague-- -I said get lost! Off you go. Get lost! Tara. If you hurt my brother, I'll hunt you down and I'll kill you! We exposed Ex-Minister Pazhani with our sting operation. We are holding evidence, but our boss is refusing to publish. What are we going to do with the evidence? We should get him arrested right away! We should not wait. -You want something, sir. -No thanks. Whiskey, large, neat. -Repeat. -Sure, ma'am. Whiskey, whiskey. Maaran. Big celebrity writer Maaran. I like you. But I like your sister more. Basically, it's a good set-up. Set-up? You're average looking. I look like a supermodel. You're dark-skinned. I'm light-skinned. You're brilliant. I'm... brilliant too. Oh! -Don't you see it? -What? We're a perfect match. Listen, if you're going to give me a hard time, I'll move to another seat. But whatever it is, no games! Be straightforward. Move to another seat. Maaran, because of you, the ruling party has filed a defamation case against our channel. I told you people a million times not to publish this news. We need evidence to publish news about an ex-minister. -Maaran... -Sir? Are you absolutely sure about this scam? I do, sir. The proof is safe with me. If you're ready to publish, I'll definitely hand it over. Why are you scared of publishing it? Please explain. Be very careful. The truth will make many uncomfortable. I know, sir. My father died because he made many people uncomfortable. I'll handle it, sir. Thank you. Hey, this was not an easy task. You sent amateurs to handle him. They got beaten up. Instead, you should've gone. Don't bother. I'll handle it. Don't you have any sense? Bloody fools! You guys got beaten up! Get me some water. Aren't you ashamed? My political career will end, damn it! It's a serious issue. It needs to be handled seriously. He should rue the day he messed with us! Listen, you guys don't do anything. You'll mess it up. Hire someone from out of town. Hey, Maaran should tremble in fear. Why do you suddenly want to meet me? Okay, shall I come to the coffee shop by 7:00 p.m.? -Hey! -I'll call you back. Go down and look after the house. I'm heading out. Hey, I'm heading out to meet Tara. I'm also headed out to meet my boyfriend. Boyfriend? Stop kidding around. You don't have a boyfriend. I'm telling the truth. I too have a boyfriend. Bloody brat! I share everything with you. But you kept it from me. Had I told you before, you would've done a background check and then he'd have run for his life. I'm going to meet him now and tell him you're a possessive brother and ask him to be prepared. I can't accept this. I should accept when you have a girlfriend. But you won't accept when I have a boyfriend. I'll be back home by 9-9:30 p.m. Hey, wait. I was waiting to give this on your birthday. Here you go. -Today's a good occasion too. -What is it? Take a look. Hey, when did you buy them? Today. Wear them. Does it look good? Okay... Thank you! Chittu, go safe! Okay, my dear brother. Bye! Dear, where are you headed? I'm going to bring home your son-in-law. Oh, really! Maaran. I'm speaking to you about an important matter. You seem kind of lost. Why? Listen, before I got here, Shwetha sprung the news that she's meeting her boyfriend. I'm not able to accept it. Why do you have to accept it? It's her life, and she's free to choose at her will. Don't you want her to get married? No, you're absolutely right. But I was under the impression that she'll be with me forever. Only when she mentioned about a boyfriend, it struck me that she'll get married one day and leave home. When she stepped out of the gate, it seemed like she's leaving after marriage. I was taken aback. First, I need to find out who her boyfriend is. And then find out if he's right for her. Maaran, watch out! Kill him. Hey, kill him! -Get in and leave from here. -Maaran? I'll handle them. -What about you? -I said leave. Hurry up. Ex-minister Pazhani sent you, right? You got lucky twice. Let's see if you can escape the next time. Just you wait! Shwetha's phone records. You were the last one who spoke to her. That makes you the last one to see her. Sir, I didn't. Hey, I'm investigating here. Shut up, damn it! Tell me. Sir, I... -She's my girlfriend, sir. -Okay. In the afternoon, I spoke to her over the phone. After that, I don't know what happened. After that, I didn't speak to her. I came to know only when I saw the news on the TV. I hope you're aware that withholding evidence is a crime. Sir, trust me. I'm not lying to you. Until the investigation is over, don't leave town. Understood? Okay, sir. -Okay, sir. -Okay, you may leave. This is Shwetha's post-mortem report. Getting drunk won't resolve anything. I need to ask him a few questions about her sister. Please call me once he's sober. ♪ Who hurt you, my darling? ♪ ♪ Why this silence, my dear? ♪ ♪ I will tell you stories ♪ ♪ That will end your pain ♪ ♪ Close your eyes slowly ♪ ♪ Find your peace in the dark ♪ ♪ My dear sparrow ♪ ♪ My dear sparrow ♪ ♪ My dear sparrow ♪ Maaran, it's hurting to see you like this. Please let it all out. Cry. -Please cry! -I can't. I just can't. I feel like my sister is still alive. So, I'm not able to cry. ♪ I miss your loud voice ♪ ♪ Miss your playful pinching fingers ♪ ♪ Miss the brat Who spoils my sleep? ♪ ♪ Miss your tender hands That massages my legs ♪ ♪ The sky looks dark Even after dawn ♪ ♪ I am here as a broken wall ♪ ♪ My blood will search for you ♪ ♪ You lost your body ♪ ♪ Thinking you'd come back alive ♪ ♪ I'm holding on to hope ♪ ♪ My dear sparrow ♪ ♪ My dear sparrow ♪ ♪ My dear sparrow ♪ Brother... My parents asked me not to destroy my life like you. But I left them behind and came to live with you. Maaran, if I could share your pain, I'll definitely do it. I too miss your sister. Someone has killed her. One of your enemies has killed her. But what are you doing? All you do is drink and pass out. Don't you want to find the person and avenge your sister's death? You have been destroying both our lives. Aren't you ashamed of it? You are the best investigative journalist here. So, get up and fucking investigate! If not, let's both drink until we're dead. Be very careful. The truth will make many people uncomfortable. You have important evid-- I'm also headed out to meet my boyfriend. Boyfriend? I'm telling the truth. I too have a boyfriend. Brother, brother, brother... Why were you running away? Why are you scared? Look, when my sister left home, she said she was going to meet you. But I never met her. Are you lying? Right in front of my eyes, she was burned to death. Tell me the truth. I was afraid! I feared my life would get destroyed if I got involved. Please forgive me. I never expected this to happen. What happened? I went to meet her. When we were walking on the road, someone attacked me from behind and pushed me to the ground. When I turned around... I saw him take Shwetha in a blue-coloured Fiesta. Sorry, I couldn't do anything. I abandoned her. How did he look? I didn't get a look as he attacked from behind. Did you note down the number plate? I didn't notice. But he was wearing a hearing aid. I only remember that detail. I abandoned Shwetha. I was not able to do anything. My sister's post-mortem report? I gave it to Tara. It must be at your house. We can trust him. He'll do it promptly. He's wearing a hearing aid. Okay, pick it up. I don't know what to say. We can't conclude and arrest someone with just a hearing aid. Just a hearing aid? You have visuals of a guy who has motive and wearing a hearing aid. A guy. A guy. Not exactly this guy. Ex-Minister Pazhani has a strong motive. His PA owns a blue-coloured car and wears a hearing aid. What else do you need? -Do you think it's a coincidence? -What if! What if it is? I can understand your anger and frustration, Maaran. I can't arrest an ex-minister based on a coincidental evidence. Arjun... every single day my rage to kill my sister's murderer is growing. But I am the son of Sathyamoorthy. I fight for justice through legal means. But don't expect me to stay the same, Arjun. At least investigate the minister. I don't know what I'll do-- Sorry, Maaran. I can't investigate without concrete evidence. Sounds like you work for him. Hey, don't talk nonsense! Maaran, this is wrong. Just because you're my friend... and I'm also guilty of my part in it, I'm ignoring what you said. Forget about it and see what to do next. And I'll see what I can do with these clues. Hello? Hello, Maaran, can you get to the station right away? -What happened? -Meet me in person. I'll explain. I got a call from the police station. I'm leaving, Tara. Thank you. If not for you, I would've been totally shattered. Thank you. Be careful. -Hey, just confess, damn it! -Sir, I didn't do it. -Whack him! -Sir, I'm telling the truth. Sit down, Maara. -You better confess. -Sir, please trust me. Why did you call me? Did you find any clue in my sister's case? Just like your sister, another girl has been kidnapped. How does it matter to me? And why am I here? The kidnapper has demanded to talk to you. Talk to me? Why? -Hello! -Has Maaran arrived? -This is Maaran speaking. -I killed your sister. -I've kidnapped this girl too. -Tap the call. If you wish to see the girl alive... bring Rs. 1.5 million and come alone to the place I mention. I'll share the other details during the next call. Why should I get the money? My sister-- At least save this girl, please. Don't let her die like my sister. Maaran, if the kidnapper's motive is money, we can easily catch him. He won't kill that girl. In your case, unfortunately, it was never about ransom. City Centre Mall, 8:30 p.m. -Bharath, are we ready? -Yeah, sir, we are ready. If you order, we can jump into action. No, Bharath. The kidnapper asked for Maaran. So, I want you to wait and follow him. -Understood? -Okay, sir. Sir, Maaran is here. Merry, merry Christmas! Merry, merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! Arjun, I don't think his motive was money. What makes you say that? If he's after money, he won't make me wait like this. Hey, are you okay? Hey! Hey! Hey, are you okay? Hey, stop right there! Stop! Hey! Don't be scared. You are all right. Nothing happened. You're safe. Breathe. -Do you remember anything else? -I don't know. He blindfolded me and took away my phone. No, sir, we couldn't get him. Where is Maaran? I went through the exit gate. He escaped in a blue Fiesta. I've took down the number plate. TN-07-N-6377. -Check whom it's registered to. -Okay, sir. Not just that. I saw that he was wearing a hearing aid. Sir, that car is registered under Ex-Minister Pazhani's name. Sir, it's registered under Ex-Minister Pazhani's name. Hello. Sir, this is Arjun. I need to investigate Ex-Minister Pazhani with your permission. I'm holding strong evidence. I'll follow protocol. Yes, thank you. Thank you, sir. You can't go inside, sir. I can't work at your will. Hey, how dare you barge in? I'll speak to your higher-ups. Search warrant. Maaran, stay here. I'll go inside and meet him. -No, I-- -I know this is personal for you. It'll become an issue. Let me handle it. Such arrogance because he's a former minister. What happened? He's okay if I search his place. If I find anything, he asked me to get an arrest warrant too. He asked to speak to you in private. Sit down. I killed your sister. Fucker, what can you do about it? I can shoot you now. I'll say I shot you in self-defence. You can't do squat about it. Thinks himself a hero. Listen, I didn't kill your sister. I wanted to retrieve the evidence you were holding. So, I tried to kill you, but you escaped. That's about it. I'm not a person who goes around harming family members. I will return... after the elections. That's about it between us. Don't waste my time. Go. What happened? What did he say? He didn't do it. Maaran, what are you saying? You gave me the evidence. He didn't do it. -Brother... -Keep an eye on him. Don't lose him. The state he's in will work to our advantage. Okay, brother. Hello. Sir, the Minister's PA has been using the hearing aid for one week. I checked the medical reports too. -I'll file the report at the station. -Okay. I'll hand over the details to Bharath, sir. -Okay, sir. -Yeah. After all, it's the truth. The Minister's PA started using a hearing aid recently. So, he's not the person your sister's boyfriend saw that day. Then who was wearing the hearing aid inside the hotel room? What? I mean... is it possible to get the CCTV footage from the hotel? If you really need this... for your sake, I'll let you watch it. Dude, you were right. There was a 4th man in that room. Check out this CCTV footage. We can see him removing his hearing aid. -But... -The blue Fiesta can't be found. Am I right? You're absolutely right! He wouldn't have parked the car inside the hotel. Check the exit gate camera. Check if can see the number plate. I need the address of its owner right away. -Maaran, where are you? -I'm out. We caught the accused. Come to the station right away. Come on, Maaran, look for yourself. You're in for a shock. Hey, Maara. Take your hands off him. Let him go! Shut up! You made us run in circles. Was it you who did it? It was you who said that you saw him wearing a hearing aid at the mall. Only you saw the car that no one else saw. And you gave us the number plate. He escaped. But I took down the number plate. TN-07-N-6377. We found while investigating the kidnapped girl that she's a professional stunt artist. See, Maaran, that's where your story starts to fall apart. I killed your sister. I have kidnapped this girl too. Bring Rs. 1.5 million and come alone to the place I mention. You made us go to places to misdirect us. You made us see what you wanted to show us. You made a fool out of me and made me run behind you like a rat. Awesome. At least you were able to crack this case. That's right. You're a rat. You are a rat. If you were a tiger, you should've snarled. If not, both have 4 legs and one tail. Maara, don't tell them anything. I never said anything. They don't have any evidence against you. Maaran, you've committed a serious offence. I found out details about my sister's kidnapper, connected them to the Minister's PA, and told you that he has a strong motive. But you don't bother to even investigate. Fear. Fear of politicians. Stop blabbering! The evidence you've gathered is wrong! He has nothing to do with this case. Whatever you did is a waste. He would've destroyed us. Only after I cornered the minister, I came to know about the 4th person who was wearing the hearing aid. I traced the number of the blue fiesta and found his address. His name is Parthipan. -He's a-- -Sir, he's gone mad. To him, everyone is his sister's killer. Hey, take your hands off him. What's wrong with you? Maaran, that's enough. Stay away from this investigation. -Let us do our jobs-- -You didn't do squat! -Uncle, who's behind all this? -I did it. Right now, I'm leaving. I am going after him. I dare you to stop me. Hey! Bharath, find out about the man he mentioned. Send a search team to that address. Find him before Maaran does. -Tell me, Tara. -I got Parthipan's details. Age, 46. He has been a corporation driver for 15 years. Using officers' contacts, he brokered small deals, conducted kangaroo courts, et cetera. There are many cases against him. But nothing was proved. Not just that, he has a 21-year-old daughter studying in college. She's a Student Chairman at YMR College. My goodness. That college has India's youngest political party. If we follow that sector, we can find him. I don't think we need to go after him. Not sure why, but he has been tailing me for a while. Maaran! Maaran, just listen to me. Maaran-- -Hello, Arjun. -Yeah, Tara. -I think Maaran is in danger. -What? I just got a call from Maaran. He said that Parthipan has been following him. But the call got disconnected. -I'm really scared. -Okay, I'll check on him. Sir, his name is Parthipan. He's a corporation driver. There are a few criminal charges against him. Doesn't make sense. This looks more serious than we thought. -Track down Maaran's number. -Sure, sir. Check if there are other cases filed under Parthipan's name. Yes, five years ago he was booked for illegal liquor smuggling. Similarly, there are a few cases of kangaroo courts against him. But nothing was proved against him. Maybe he's a well-connected guy. Not just that. He has not reported to work for the past 3 months. Beyond this is forest area. It's a dead end. You can't go beyond it. Give me details on any abandoned buildings and factories in this area. Yes, sir. With what we've gathered, it looks like Parthipan is leading Maaran somewhere. You were not looking for me. In fact, I came looking for you. I'll leave only after killing you. Are you trying to scare me? I'm already a living corpse. My life ended long ago. Go ahead burn me down, but your sister will still remain dead. I know that my sister is not dead. You picked up a random corpse and meticulously matched all the DNA samples. She has a metal plate in her arm from a childhood accident. You were not aware of it. In the post-mortem report, it was clearly mentioned that no plate was found in the body. Every moment since she died, a voice inside me told me that she's still alive. That's when I truly realised that she's still alive. Every minute she must be expecting her brother to come and save her. Where's my sister? Tell me! Where's my sister? Worried about your sister? It's not just you with a family. My sweetheart... My daughter. Do you know what happened to my Suja because of you? Suja was my only daughter. Her mother passed away when she was an infant. I became everything to her. Just like every father I wanted to provide her everything she wished for. I was a criminal, but I was always a good father to her. Just 2 years... she agreed to get married after completing M.Phil. I was going to quit illegal activities once she settles down. Can we trust him? We can trust him. He'll do it promptly. But the one news item you reported shattered all my dreams in just one day. We entrusted you, but you betrayed us. -I didn't, sir. -How did the bag get over there? -I had nothing to do with it. -We're under a lot of pressure. -I'll fix it. -Don't think you can get away with it. -They'll find you and kill you. -I'll fix it. Suja. Where are you? Hey, Suja! I kept a bag over here. Where is it? I know. It's the black bag, right? Dad, what was inside the bag? That doesn't concern you. Where's the bag? "Are the politicians who are supporting advanced technology "also resorting to tampering EVM machines to win the elections?" I asked where the bag is. I did what I felt was right. I was getting paid Rs. 1.5 million to just replace the machines. To prove your honesty, you threw it away. Dad, would you do anything for money? You're punishing me for your sins! Dad, I thought you were a good man. See, they've started to chase me. Now they won't let us live in peace. Pack up everything. We have to leave town. Dad, when Maaran tweeted about our college's political party, I was happy to share that with you. -Suja, you're talking unnecessarily. -But now... that same Maaran has reported news about you... I'll be back in half an hour. Be ready. Why should I run and hide? I didn't commit any crime. You're naive. You don't understand how the world works. I said leave. That's about it. I'm not leaving. It's you who has committed a crime. Listen, your mother died right after your birth. To give you a good education, I began driving a liquor truck. Then you wanted to do Ph.D. How do you think we could afford it? This is how I can make it. So, you're saying you did it all for me? That's right I did it for you. Don't blame me for your greed. Suja, this is not the time for argument. The issue has gotten out of hand. I'll be back soon. Be ready to leave. Brother, hurry up! Suja! Suja! Suja... Suja! Suja! You reporters write whatever you want. You report news as if you've done something great. You don't think for a moment how it affects a family. The pain that family has to endure. Have you ever given a thought to the loss that family has to bear? Do you know how it feels when you're burned to death? My only child, and she is gone now. I'm hiding in fear, wondering when someone will kill me. It's all fucking because of you. You asked for a reason, right? I wanted you to go through the same pain. That's why I did it. You will publish news and become popular. But people like me are left with no choice but to die. -I published the truth-- -What truth? Fine, use the truth to find your sister. Sir, my sister is innocent. -Why, sir? -Why? I'll spare your sister. Take out your phone. I said take it out. When it happens to you, the fear kicks in. "The news I reported until today on EVM machines is a lie." "The news about Pazhani were all rumours." Publish it, saying you reported it to gain quick fame. Tweet that and go to prison. I will spare you sister. Don't think too much. Only if I go, your sister will be fed. If I don't, then only her bones will remain. Publish it. Maara, your crying is not going to change anything. Publish it. What is it? Publish it. Publish, damn it! Bloody incompetent scum. I'll come to you after I kill him. Hey, is it him? Look properly and confirm. Yes, that's him, sir. He turned a small job into a huge problem. I'm going to kill him right away. Hey, look, I have no issues with you. Let go of the recordings, evidence and him. I'll let you live. -Hey! -Maaran, drop your gun. Put down your gun. Please hear me out. Bharath! It's important to stay righteous in your life. But being smart is the most important thing. We should save our loved ones from the dangers that arise due to the righteous path we choose. My sister is not dead. He kidnapped her. Hey, I don't even know who your sister is. The other day I told you, right? He helped me find her. That's why he shot him. I was trying to save him. Hey. -He's lying. -Bharath, get him. Sir? Sir? Hey, take your hands off. I'll come. -Sir, let's go. -Hey, call the Chief. I said I'm coming. Hey, take your hands off me. Sir, please co-operate. Sir, please let me go. Check his pulse. Sir, his pulse rate is low. Quickly take him to the hospital. ♪ I miss your loud voice ♪ ♪ Miss your playful pinching fingers ♪ ♪ Miss the brat Who spoils my sleep ♪ ♪ Miss your tender hands That massages my legs ♪ ♪ The sky looks dark Even after dawn ♪ ♪ I am here as a broken wall ♪ ♪ My blood will search for you ♪ ♪ You lost your body ♪ ♪ Thinking you would Come back alive ♪ ♪ I'm holding on to hope ♪ ♪ My dear sparrow ♪ ♪ My dear sparrow ♪ ♪ My dear sparrow ♪ ♪ My dear sparrow ♪ This morning, in the cases related to the EVM scam and attempted murder, former Minister Pazhani has been arrested and presented in court. Parthipan, who was an accomplice of Ex-Minister Pazhani, confessed to his crimes and turned into an approver. This incident has created a sensation in the entire nation. -Hello. -Tell me, sir. What happened to Shwetha? And how is Maaran? Maaran is fine, sir. But Shwetha has eyesight damage. She was locked up in a fertilizer warehouse. Because of phosphorous content exposure, she lost her sight. Oh, no! What did the doctor say? Sir, the surgery is about to end. The doctor said she will definitely get her eyesight back. Okay, stay there and take care of them. If you need anything, give me a call right away.
