(suspenseful music) (heavy rock music) (laughing) - (laughs) Hey Yuri. (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (suspenseful music) (water bubbling) (gun pops) (groans) (gun pops) (groans) (hook clinking) (gun fires) (groaning) (gun fires) (screams) (explosion booms) (gun fires) (groans) (radio buzzing) (speaking in foreign language) (suspenseful music) (speaking in foreign language) - Com radio. - Com Nine, this is the XL. - [Com Nine] Sir we've intercepted a ship to shore radio transmission in the area. Definitely Russian, appears to be a may day. - Have your linguist translate it and bring it to me immediately. - [Com Nine] Aye sir. - Captain, sonar. We're getting weak tones to the south-west, definitely propeller cavitation. - Surface or submerged? - Submerged. Range approximately 75,000 yards. I've run a database search, but it doesn't match any contact on file. - Very well sonar, record the contact for further analysis. Com out. - [Officer] I've got that translation sir. - This is the XL, get Ops up here asap. Stand by for a flash burst transmission to the Pentagon. And wake the captain, this is big. (explosion booms) (metal clinking) (explosion booms) (suspenseful music) (rotors whirring) (engines whooshing) - [Burns] How much is President aware of at this time? - [Woman] All he knows is that he wants to keep it out of the press. - [Burns] That's exactly why this should be an FBI matter. - Have you seen his poll numbers? - Yeah, he's kind of weak. - Alright people, let's bring this meeting to order. I have to meet with the President in one hour. Thank you. Alright you all know Rear Admiral Todd, Chief of the Naval Intelligence Service. I have asked him to begin the formal briefing. - Gentleman, the nightmare scenario is now a reality. Last night a Russian Federation transport ship was attacked on the high seas. It was carrying spent nuclear fuel to a reprossessing plant in Taiwan. The attackers got away with 20 kilograms of weapons grade plutionium. - Which is enough to make several crude but effective nuclear devices. - Director Burns, what's the FBI's take? - We're afraid the plutonium may be sold on the black market. It could end up in the hands of any rogue state or terrorist organization and be used in an attack against the United States. We believe this may be the work of an international crime organization run by a terrorist who calls himself, Darian Cane. He's a former Soviet Special Forces Colonel, his real name is Vladimir Litkovsky. He's a modern day pirate and absolutely ruthless. Supplied the weapons for several attacks against US installations abroad. - So what are you going to do about it? - I intend to track him down, apprehend him and drag him back to the United States for trial. Is that good enough for you Admiral? - You are way out of your league. - The FBI has a clear congressional mandate to pursue them to hell and back if necessary. - Gentleman let's not work at cross purposes. You both make valid points on the issue. - Alright. I'm going to propose to the President a joint task force. Half FBI, half military. Your mission is to capture Darian Cane and retrieve the stolen plutonium. - Excuse me sir but the FBI's idiotic rules of engagement could get my people killed. I don't want anything to do with that. - Nor do I, bring the military into this they'll kill everything in sight. I need live defendants to bring to trial. - Director Burns, the Admiral's Spec Ops team will get your men in to make your arrests. But more importantly, his team will make sure your men and their prisoners get back out in one piece. - You two are just gonna have to learn to live with one another, is that clear? Now pick your best men and be in my office in 90 minutes. Meeting adjourned. - Well, if you have to plot cot, you have to play cot. Get Webb Buckley in here to see me ASAP. (suspenseful music) (engine whooshing) - Hangman this is Bad Dog. Hangman this is Bad Dog. - I read you five by five Bad Dog. - Don't you think what we're about to do is a little crazy for a couple of old guys like us. - It's like riding a bike. - A 50,000 pound bike, full of JP4 moving at Mark 1.8. - You want out? - You wish. - Then hold onto your hat. (engines whooshing) (computer beeping) - [Frank] Not bad Hangman. - Just watch me. Feeling a little heat there buddy? - Nothing I can't handle. - You're toast man. - No one ever said it was gonna be easy. (engine whooshing) - What the hell? Godammit White, where'd you learn that trick? - Something I keep up my sleeve to bail me out of a dicey situation. (computer beeping) - Ah shit. - Hey consider yourself lucky. You can walk away from this one. - Yeah Frank, eat me. (radio beeping) - [Enterprise ATC] Hangman this is Enterprise ATC, they want back in Oceana pronto. Break off and bring your bird in for a refuel asap. (suspenseful music) Hangman your three quarters of a mile out and on the flight path. Hold steady. - [Webb] Roger, Hangman has the ball. (suspenseful music) - Webb. - Admiral. I hope I didn't drag you away from anything important? - Can it Webb, I've got a mission for you. - I'm all ears. (engine whooshing) - Here's the situation we've got to find-- (Admiral drowned out by whooshing engines) - Joint task forces are fine Admiral. But sending Special Forces teams in to arrest people. It's 10 times more dangerous than just killing 'em. - That's why I want you there Webb. Now you've had time on the ground behind enemy lines. You can fly anything that's ever been made, fixed wing or chopper. You interface well with Special Forces, you're a pain in my ass Webb, but you're the best. If this mission is gonna be successful I need you at the helm. - I got one question. What ever happened to Bone Conn? - Okay amigos, up until now I've just been your friendly American military advisor. This raid changes all of that. Starting now it gets real, very real. Vincente, tell the men who we're going up against. - Caballeros, the glory road guerrillas, like sisters with ties to the cartels. They've been holed up for three days following a violent bank robbery. - So they're desperate. If you have to shoot, shoot to kill. (speaking in foreign language) - Alright let me hear it. - [Together] Hoo ya! - You guys sound like the Vienna boys choir, let me hear it. - [Together] Hoo ya! - Now you sound like Seals. (rotors whirring) (suspenseful music) (gun fires) (guns firing) (groans) (gun fires) (screams) Is this what you want? (gun clicks) How about now? - Hold him. You bagged yourself a bad guy. (rotors whirring) So that's the deal. You in or what? We could really use you. (melancholy music) (explosion booms) (rotors whirring) (suspenseful music) - [SHN] Control this SHN. There's a Bomb Disposal Unit standing by. - [Command] Roger SHN. Keep them back for now. Snipers move into position. Spotters prepare to fire. - I'm Special Agent Murphy, you guys must be the grunts. - Commander's Buckley and Conn. - We've had some hot intel on a domestic terrorist cell. Looks like they've got their very own bomb factory in there. My partner Agent Daniels is on the assault team, we're about to take them down. You gentleman can have a ringside seat. - Cool. (suspenseful music) - [Command] All agents surround all exits. Shooters identify your targets. All units move into position. All units prepare to initiate assault on my mark. Roof units rappel into position. Snipers keep them covered. (door bangs) (gun fires) We are facing fire. - [Agents] Freeze, nobody move! (guns firing) - [Command] All units prepare to intercept. We have suspects in flight. Suspects are in flight. Heads up people, I want agents covering all exits. Shooters, identify your target. Sniper teams move into position. Spotters triangulate your fire. (suspenseful music) (man shouting drowned out by suspenseful music) - Should I take him out? - No, hold your fire. Agent Daniels is giving the signal to wait. All units hold your fire. Repeat, hold your fire. Careful. (suspenseful music) (groaning) Yes! - [Radio] Control we need paramedics on the second floor rear. Control we need paramedics to the second floor rear. - [Control] Roger that, medical team is on the way over and out. - Agent Daniels good work. Meet Commander's Conn and Buckley. They're our military counterparts. - Special Agent Morgan Daniels. - I'm confused. I wasn't aware that Agent Daniels was a woman. - Is that problem? - [Murphy] It better not be a problem. - No disrespect intended, but these are gonna be extremely dangerous operations, not exactly the place for a woman. - I do okay. Or did you have your eyes closed when I took down that scumbag? - Oh no I saw. And I think you exercised extremely poor judgment. - I think your man is just getting a little out of line-- - No, no no, it's okay. I wanna hear it. Go ahead, enlighten me. - You had snipers in position. You should've allowed them to neutralize your target instead of taking the risk that you took. - I'm a Law Enforcement Agent, Commander Conn. I don't kill people unless I have to. - Excuse me Agent Daniels, but that's not how it works in the field. We're going up against extreme international terrorists on their turf. And they play rough. - I play rough. - Not rough enough. Listen Daniels these people aren't like us, they're animals. - Murph, don't tell me I have to take crap from this trained monkey. - Morgan, Morgan. Special Agent Daniels has been assigned to this unit by the United States Justice Department. Her assignment has been approved by the Attorney General and the Department of Defense. If you have a problem with that, perhaps you should take it up with them. - Commander Conn does raise an interesting point though. - The top of his head does not count. - These are gonna be tough operations, maybe tougher than you're accustomed too. So we have to work together as a team on Special Operations techniques. - Sounds like fun. (suspenseful music) (rotors whirring) - [Soldier] Go, go, go! - Those are Seals in action. You're gonna be learning some of those techniques. (men shout distantly) - [Soldier] Move your ass people. - [Soldier] Move it, move it. - I don't see any women out there. - Submarine operations are inherently the most dangerous that Seals conduct. The sub will take us to within striking range of our objective. Then we lock out while the sub remains underwater and undetected. - Key concepts are as follows. Take a deep breath, clear the hatch, slowly blow it out as you ascend. But do not ascend faster than your slowest bubble. If you do, you die. - Since these concepts are so important to your survival, Seals have developed numerous exercises designed to make you more comfortable with underwater operations. - Okay, shall we. - I don't like the look in his eye. (water bubbling) (gasps) - Having fun yet? (water bubbling) (gasps) Pathetic Daniels, this is a little kids pool. - Bite me. (water bubbling) (gasps) - Oh no a wave. (water splashing) Come on Daniels. (gasps) (coughing) - You sadist. - Listen lady if you can't-- - What is your problem Conn? You get beat up by a lot of girls at elementary school and taking it out on me? - I'm trying to make sure you don't get yourself killed. Or kill a member of our team. Because this isn't a game. (sighs) If you think today was tough, wait until you try in the middle of the North Atlantic. - Thanks for the warning. - You're not going on this op if you're not mission qualified, and I don't think you'll make it. - Oh I'll make it, will you? - What are these? - Homework. For you and your buddy. Justice Department procedures including the Congressional Statutes we operate under while chasing bad guys on foreign soil. I suggest you read them carefully. You're responsible for knowing all of it. Good day Commander Conn. (suspenseful music) - Prepare to transmit. (radio buzzes) (speaking in foreign language) Comrades. Welcome to today's auction. Uplink to my private satellite. It is totally untraceable. You have my guarantee. On the block today is 20 kilograms of weapons grade plutonium. The bidding will start at three million dollars. I have three million dollars, I need five. Five million? I have five million dollars. 10, 10 million dollars. Ah it seems bidder number four is getting impatient. The bid is now 50 million dollars. Do I hear 55 million dollars? Be careful bidder number six, I know your organization does not have this kind of money. Do not play with me. It could quickly turn dangerous. The bidding is at 50 million dollars. 50 million going once, going twice. Sold to bidder number four for 50 million dollars. Congratulations you are first to own private atomic bomb. - We finally got a match on the USS Hertford's tone data. You're not gonna believe this. It's a Soviet Foxtrot Class submarine, early 60's vintage. - It makes sense. The sub shattered the freighter. Cane's men pulled a classic submerged lock out. Took down the ship then dove back to the sub for a getaway. Slick. - How the hell did they get a submarine? - You boys wouldn't believe what you can buy on the international arms market. - A Foxtrot is a diesel boat. That means a short cruising range. - Cane's gotta have a base nearby. Admiral can you have your intel boys go over all the satellite data for the East China Sea? Say going back a week. - That's affirmed. Alright Webb get your team on a priority transport to Guam. We've got to be pre-positioned to move on this thing as soon as possible. I'll update you with any intel as it comes in. Good hunting. - Aye aye sir. (engine whooshing) Alright, got our op order. Looks like the intel folks found our man. Okay, these are satellite images of an island in the Formosa Strait. Notice the abandoned oil facility. Look carefully at the dockyard facilities. That's our rogue sub. Okay the State Department says the ownership of the islands is in dispute between Taiwan and Red China. - That means we have to get in and out without being detected. - Precisely. That's why our launch platform is one of our own subs. - A submarine, great. - Commander Conn, I wondered if I might have a word with you? - Cold feet already? - Commander Conn let me be blunt. I know about your wife. - What are you talking about? - 1990, Subic Bay. A terrorist bomb at the O club. Your wife is killed. They never catch the bomber. - Okay, you know. So what? - So you declared a one man war on terrorism. What's your body count Commander? - You don't wanna know. - You're a loose cannon Conn. I'm afraid you're going to do something stupid, like kill Darian Cane. - I will perform my function within mission parameters Agent Daniels. However, if unexpected circumstances should arise I will do what is necessary to protect myself and my team. Understand? - This operation is of critical importance to my organization and to me. I've been chasing Darian Cane for six years. Bring him back alive and we can squeeze him for intel on every terrorist group in the world. You screw this up and I'll guarantee you a stretch at Leavenworth. If I don't shoot you first. - You do what you have to. (engine whooshing) (suspenseful music) - Afternoon gentleman, I'm Judge Swaggart of the Fifth Circuit Court. Will you two raise your right hands please? - What's going on? - Didn't you read that crap they gave us? - Yeah, some of it. - We're being sworn in as Federal Agents. - Federal Agents what the hell for? - The statutes we operate under only allow members of the FBI to participate in operations on foreign soil. - Sending soldiers could start a war. - Stick 'em gentleman. I, state your name. Do solemnly swear. - I, John Conn - I, Webb Buckley - Solemnly swear. - Solemnly swear. This is so embarrassing. (suspenseful music) - [Com] Com Sonar. - Sonar this is the Captain, what is it? - I have a contact sir, sounds like a Chinese Acula, range 50,000 yards. - Designate contact Master One. XO, get our visitors down here, I need to have a word with them. - Aye, aye sir. (suspenseful music) - What's up Captain? - We've made contact with a hostel submarine. Now the Chinese have a picket line of boats guarding their waters. I'm just letting you know if we can't slip past, this op ends here. - Excuse me Captain, but our orders come directly from the National Command Authority. - Understand this. We are a naval vessel at sea. I'm responsible for my crew as well as 24 nuclear missiles. I will not take unnecessary risks for some dubious cloak and dagger show. - Understood Captain. Permission to remain. - [Captain] Why? - Because I wanna be here when you snooker that chump out of his socks. - (laughs) Granted. Attention all hands. Man battle stations, rig for quiet ship. Helm take us under the layer, steady as she goes. Make your speed 10 knots. Do not cavitate. Make your depth a thousand feet. Cross your fingers gentleman. - Closing on contact, 20,000 yards. 19 nine. Eight. Seven. Six. (machinery buzzes) - What the hell? Engine room report. - [Engineer] It's a build pump sir, it must be a faulty relay. - [Captain] Well shut it off. - [Engineer] We're working on it sir. (suspenseful music) - [Engineer] Com, engine room. Pumps been shut down sir. - Too late Captain. Master One's coming about. He's got us pegged. - That scotches things. Guess we better break off and make a run for it. - The Texas does not run mister. XO, what do you think Captain Kirk would do right about now? - The Corbomite Maneuver. - Very good XO, we might make a skipper of you yet. Torpedo room. - [Torpedo Man] Torpedo room, hi. - Tubes one and two. Do not load torpedoes, open outer doors only. - [Torpedo Man] Tubes one and two. Do not load torpedoes, open outer doors only, aye. - Won't they hear that? - They damn well better. - Torpedo room tubes one and two, fire water shots. - [Torpedo Man] Aye. (water bubbling) - [Sonar Man] He's turning sir, making a run for it. - Weapons com, launch a noisemaker bearing 221. - Master One is coming around. Going full speed after the decoy. Oh yeah. He is so out of here. - Snookered enough for you? - One question Captain. How do you get cojones that big down the hatch? - (laughs) All in a days work gentleman. Helm, ahead one third. Now you two get your team together. We're dropping you and getting the hell out of dodge before our Chinese friend realizes he's been duped. - Aye sir. - Aye sir. I'm last out. See you on the surface. Commence flood. (pipes squeaking) (water bubbling) (suspenseful music) (gasps) - Where's Bone? - I don't know he didn't come up yet. (water bubbling) (gasps) - I am supposed to be grateful now? - Just doing my job. - Good, 'cause we've got a long swim ahead of us and I don't wanna hear any whining. - Well tape your mouth shut then. (suspenseful music) (phone ringing) - [Frank] Frank White? - [Admiral] Frank, it's Admiral Todd. - [Frank] Hey Admiral long time. - A set of orders came down for you. I need you to grab a Hornet at Miramar, and fly out to the USS John F. Kennedy. We're on station in the Pacific and we're going to monitor Webb's mission with a CIA spy satellite link up. Good flying Frank, see you in a couple of hours. (suspenseful music) (engines whooshing) (suspenseful music) (radios chattering) We should be ready nearly. Down links coming online now. Here's the real time satellite infrared feed. The teams moving into position now. - Okay, here's how it goes. We hunker down and lie low all day. Get a read on their security and possibly Cane's location. Nightfall we infiltrate, two teams, make the snatch. - What if we hit opposition? - [Murphy] Neutralize them. - With non lethal means. (rotors whirring) (suspenseful music) - Okay, I got a chopper in bound. It's a Hyde. Admiral are you getting all this? Okay, choppers down. Got three passengers disembarking. They're in uniform, possibly middle-eastern. - I concur. I also know that helicopter rotor isn't idle. - The damn buys going down. - We've gotta move now. - What about the plan? - Newsflash, forget about Cane. Those guys in the chopper are gonna buy the plutonium and get away with it. - He's right. We need to prioritize. - Don't sweat it Daniels. No plan ever survives first contact with the enemy intact. (suspenseful music) - Ah, our mysterious bidder number four. No introduction please, let me guess. Boman Ali Mohamed, former Iraqi Deputy Defense Minister, now working for some of Jihad. - You've done your homework, I'm impressed. - This makes one of us. You have money? - Of course. (speaking in foreign language) - We count now. - I see two guards, they seem alert. - Confirmed. Wait a second, what the hell is that? To your right, three o'clock. - [Webb] It's the chopper pilots. - Something smells funny. (suspenseful music) - The buyers are double crossing Cane. - [Daniels] We have to move now. - Wait a minute. Just stand down, let 'em waste each other. Even out the odds. - Including Darian Cane? No way. - I agree, we go now. (exhales) - Nobody move! - Put your guns down. - Put your weapons down, put it down. - Well Mr. Cane, if you please. My materials. - You cannot get away with this Mohamed. - Oh I think I will. - [Together] Freeze. - Lower your weapons. - [Webb] Put your weapons down. Now. (gun fires) (groaning) (guns firing) (screaming) - Cane's getting away. - He's heading for the sub. Webb hold them off. - Are you nuts? - That psycho will kill Cane. (gun fires) - Looks like it's just you and me. - Who has more fun than us? (guns firing) - Full speed. Full speed! Full speed. Full speed. Prepare to submerge. Get this bucket of bolts on the way now. Full speed, now, now! What a day I have had. (suspenseful music) (guns firing) (gun clicks) (guns firing) - Any good news? - No. - I've got an idea. - Great. (gun fires) (groaning) - So much for not lethal. - Freeze! On your feet Cane. Hands in the are. - Not quite done 'ere. First this idiot Iraqi, now you. Who are you? - I mean it Cane, on your feet. - You told me to freeze. American Law Enforcement? DEA? FBI? I'm getting warmer huh? - Don't make me do it Cane. - If you wanted to kill me, I would be dead now. - Cane. - You need me alive, or you would not be here. - I swear it Cane, I'll kill you deader than hell. - I don't think so. And now we have Mexican stand-off or as we say Chechen stand-off huh? You will not shoot me. - She won't, but I will. - Who are you? - Ever heard of the Navy Seals? - Commander Conn put that gun down. - Sorry Daniels but Mr. Cane will drop his weapon or I'll autograph that wall with his brains. - Put it down Conn. - You failed, my turn. - I said put that gun down right now Conn and I mean it. - You'll have to shoot me. - Dammit Bone. - How about it Cane? Wanna roll the dice on me. I'll tell you what. I'll count to three. One. - I will shoot her, right in the head. - Two. - Back off Conn, now! - If it's all the same with you Cane, I'd just as soon you didn't drop your weapon. (suspenseful music) - I do not think she will shoot. But I think you would. So, I throw myself on the mercy of American justice system huh? After all, you have no gulags. - That's the last time you'll ever hold a gun Cane. As for you-- - Maybe I was bluffing. - Hey people, time to exit. Let's not stick around for the real bad guys to show up. - Take care of our package. - I've got him. (melancholy music) - Nighttrain this Airwax Control. I'm patching you through to Director Cunningham. - [Nighttrain] Roger Airwax. Attention passengers we have an incoming flash burst transmission from the Pentagon. I'm connecting you via satellite relay to Director Cunningham in the NSA situation room. - Team, this is Cunningham. Good work on your first mission. We have a new situation on our hands. The State Department has received intel that Islamic extremists are planning a major terrorist attack on a US military target sometime in the near future. I have to meet with the President in one hour and I'm going to give him my strong recommendation to continue our joint task force concept. So don't pack your bags for vacation just yet. You're going to have to remain on full alert. Cunningham out. - Great. (engine whooshing) - You can do this. - I can. - This is the explosive lock. This the timer and detonator. I've set the timer for 9:00 p.m.. You will have two hours to swim to the field depot at the American Naval Base, understand? - I understand. - Your reward will be eternity in paradise. (suspenseful music) (water bubbling) (explosion booms) (suspenseful music) (engines whooshing) - Webb. - Murphy. - Three days ago there was a terrorist attack on an America Naval Base in Turkey, leaving 17 of our people dead. - We've traced the suicide bombers movements, he was not acting alone and was most likely trained at a facility in central Afghanistan. The base is a kind of terrorist bootcamp run by a man we know only as Kamal. - National Command Authorities decided to deploy your team to Afghanistan. There you are to find the base camp, snatch Kamal and bring him back to the US. - Where he'll be tried on 17 separate counts of murder. - It's not gonna be that easy getting into Afghanistan. Since the end of the war the Soviets have been fighting among themselves. Right now a group called the Taliban controls most of the country. - We're aware of that. Taliban are the most extreme of the Muslim fundamentalist groups. The Taliban are being propped up by a host of other radical Islamic nations, striking the West is probably their way of carrying favor with their patrons. - We've gotta move fast on this. Kamal is a clever bastard. To confuse our satellites he's moving his camps around on a near regular basis. - So I guess it's about time to call out the troops. - You'll be deployed to the USS Enterprise. There Commander Conn along with our two agents will attempt insertion by fast tag vehicle and make the snatch. - Excuse me sir, what about me? - You're gonna stay on the USS Enterprise and fly the extraction helicopter. - Sir I should be on the ground with my team. - Technically you're a Federal Agent on a mission of international law enforcement. If you get shot down, it'll be easier to explain than if you were just a military pilot. - I got a bad feeling about this. - Son, if anything goes wrong out there I'll back you 100%, even if it costs me my job. But you know that. - Yes sir. Thank you sir. - Then get to it. (suspenseful music) (guns firing distantly) - [Sat Com] Snakeeater this is Sat Com Relay Station 11. Now patching you through to the USS Enterprise. (suspenseful music) (guns firing distantly) (camera clicking) - I have the target in sight. Not a very friendly place. (engine revving) I count about 50 men, a number of support vehicles, and some armor. This is not gonna be an easy one. Commander Conn, how's it look from your position? (guns firing distantly) - [Conn] Large troop movement. There's enough stuff here to take out an entire army. If we don't strike fast, he's gonna move his base of operations. - How's the mission going? - Sounds hairy. - Someone's coming. (goat bleating) He's a civilian. (yelling) (shouting in foreign language) (guns firing) - Abort, we're aborting this mission. Do you copy? We are aborting. - Damn it, here they come. (guns firing) (suspenseful music) (guns firing) - [Webb] We got another pilot for that extraction chopper? - [Admiral] I know what you're thinking Webb and I don't like it. - [Webb] I need you to authorize a fully armed Hornet for me. - [Admiral] Kamal has Triple A set up all around that base camp. You'd be flying in with no fighter escort and no jammers. A suicide mission? You think you're up for that? - [Webb] That's affirmed. - [Admiral] Good hunting. (engine whooshing) (suspenseful music) (guns firing) - We're trapped, we'll never make the extraction point. - Just keep shooting. (guns firing) (engine whooshing) What now? (explosions booms) Woo hoo, I'll be damned if that ain't Webb Buckley. (engine whooshing) (explosions booming) (men shouting) (engine whooshing) (rocket whooshing) (computer beeps) - I hope that's not an American stinger. Another brilliant move by the CIA, giving missiles to those guys. Define irony? Being shot down by one of your own missiles. (computer beeping) (explosion booms) - Damn it. - Do you see a chute? Yeah, he popped a chute. (engine revving) We're in trouble. (gun firing) - We're out of here. (guns firing) - We can't leave the rendezvous point until Bone gets here. - If we stay any long we're dead. We're the only ones in the world who know what Kamal looks like. If we don't get those pictures back this entire missions a failure. Now come on. (suspenseful music) (engine revving) (men shouting) (guns firing) (gun fires) (engine revving) - Where's Bone? - He was on a recon, never made it to the rendezvous point. - It was too hot, we had to get out of there. (guns firing) - That sounds like the one man army now. Alright you guys go the extraction point, I'll get Bone. (engine revving) (guns firing) Come on Bone, time to move out. If we don't make it out of here alive, this missions a failure and we'll be dead. (guns firing) - Go! (suspenseful music) (rocket whooshing) (explosions booming) (screams) - Someone's coming. - Bone's dead. (melancholy music) Here comes the chopper. (rotors whirring) Let's go home. (melancholy music) (upbeat music) ♪ Hey now baby, what time you get off work ♪ - To Bone. ♪ I just wanna jam in my shirt ♪ Meet me at six o'clock - This is wrong. He shouldn't have died. - What were you expecting Murphy? We're invincible? This is war and people get killed. Next time it could be me, or you, or Morgan. Bone was a warrior, he played a rough game and he lost. I just wish I was on the ground with you guys. - It wouldn't have made any difference we were completely outgunned. If you hadn't come in with that close air support when you did, we all would be finished. We all would've died. - What the hell kind of Irish wake is this? Sit down, sit down, at ease. Well, I do have some good news. The Joint Chiefs and the Attorney General beat up on the White House. They secured permission for the team to go back after Kamal. I know that's what you all want. - Alright, let's go. - If we go in again, I wanna be on the ground with the team. - I understand. Now if you gonna go in, we're gonna need a new man. I was thinking about Frank White. - Good man. Not a barrel of laughs, will he do it? - It can't hurt to ask. (suspenseful music) - I got you in my sights now. It's all over for you my friend. (camera clicking) (bird tweeting) Summerhorn sparrow, very rare. At last. Last time I checked this was private property. What part of no trespassing don't you understand? - It's all those big words you use. Next time try "keep out." - Webb Buckley of all the low down dirty fly boy tricks. Who's the suit? - I guess I'm the bait dejour. Special Agent William Murphy FBI. - The Feds are working with us on a little project. - It's a unique team, a co-operative effort from Justice and the Department of Defense to apprehend international terrorists. - We get to go to foreign locales, meet exotic new people and arrest them. - Sounds like it's up Bone Conn's alley. - Bone's dead Frank. - Really. - The last mission was um, problematic. - We want you to take his place. Interested? - Beyond interested. (suspenseful music) (gun firing) - [Daniels] Dammit Webb. - [Webb] Maybe she was a collaborator. - [Daniels] This is serious Buckley. - [Webb] Give me a break I'm a pilot. - [Murphy] Why not Morgan he-- - [Daniels] Stay out of Murph. - [Murphy] What's gotten into you? - [Daniels] No, what's gotten into you. - What am I running a team here or a day care center? I know everybody's on edge, but the reason we're training together is to function as a unit. So let's just dispense with the blame game and see if we can get this together. It's the only way we're gonna survive this little adventure alive, do you understand me? - [Webb] If you're really good it's milk and cookies on me. Now come on. - You guys through? I'd like to get back to it. - We have 48 hours, are we gonna be ready? - I don't know man. (engine whooshing) (suspenseful music) - Hey Murph, I'll trade you ham flavored shoe leather for your dog food a la king. - No, I'll stick to dog food. - Suit yourself. - You'll get used to it. - That's what Bone used to say. You were his CL, his death must've been hard on you. - Actually I'm surprised he lasted as long as he did. - How so? - Bone was always borderline. His wife's death put him over the edge. - But he was good soldier. - In some ways. Strong yes. Fearless absolutely. But he was also stupid. - I don't follow. - Bone was always controlled by his emotions. Let his passion get the best of him. - And you? - I'm a professional Murph. - Don't you feel anything? - Bone and I were in the Seals, that's a bond you'll never be able to understand. We were together for five years and I spent every one of those years preparing for his death. Now it's here. - If you don't mind my saying so Commander White, you are one cold son of a bitch. - Thank you Agent Murphy, glad you noticed. (suspenseful music) (engine revving) - There's a lot more armor down there than the intel boys said there'd be. - He's linked up with the Taliban army division. Must be about time for him to move his camp. (suspenseful music) - Yeah we can't risk a direct confrontation. We can't do jack against that Soviet armor. - Listen up people, our op plan is out the window. We gotta start from square one. - It's too bad we can't just pop him from here. - That contravenes our orders Morgan. - The tactical situations changed, we have to adapt. - That's not adaptation, that's assassination. - Let's face reality Murph. They're not just gonna hand him over when we flash our badges. - Take it easy you two. There's gotta be a way we can do this within mission parameters. - Um, people, I think the question has become academic. (speaking in foreign language) - Okay, now what? - Just chill out. I don't think this guys the Taliban. I think he's Mujahideen. - How can you tell? - Look at the guys footwear, American sneakers. Taliban would never wear that. They despise everything western. - Let's give it a try. Do you speak English? - [Gunman] You are American? - You are Mujahideen? - You are invading our homeland, what is your purpose here? - We're here to capture Kamal. - The trouble with you westerners is you all look alike. So hard to tell an American from a Frenchman or from a Russian. - Sorry. - So tell me which American President was assassinated in 1901? - McKinley. I saw it on Jeopardy. - The question is how did he know that? - I know America. I'm going to travel there to attend dental school. - Would it be possible for us to meet with your leader. - [Gunman] I'm certain he would be happy to talk to you. - What is this some kind of Chip and Dales thing? - There are many prying eyes around. Best for you to look as local as possible. Now come, we go to my village. (suspenseful music) - I did not know American combat teams brought their harems with them. - We are a joint task force sir. Agent Murphy, Agent Daniels are members of my countries Federal Bureau of Investigation. They're Law Enforcement Agents. - Why have you come? - We came for Kamal. We have orders to capture him and bring him back to my country to face trial. - What crimes has he committed in your land? - He bombed an American Naval Base, 17 servicemen were killed. - Of course, we kill each other no one cares. But now that our war has touched you. - He's training terrorists, that's everyone's problem. - I know. And it weighs heavily on me. What must the world think of Islam? All it knows is the evil a few extremists do. Islam teaches peace, but there are those that will twist out teachings and use them to murder innocence. - We've identified the bomber. He was teenage boy named Bahman Ibrahim, have you heard of him? - He was my nephew. - He was from this village? - Kamal recruits our boys. He fills their heads with lies. The last time I saw Bahman he was a stranger to me. Kamal filled him with hate and sent him into the world to murder. - How many more recruits does he have? - Dozens. Maybe hundreds. - He's creating an army of suicide bombers. - Can you imagine the damage he could do? He could kill thousands of innocent people. - Gotta stop him. - If you kill him, you will make him a martyr. - That's ridiculous. - You speak only when spoken to. - How dare you? I'm a Federal Agent of the United States of Amer-- - Quiet. When in Rome Morgan, understand. - Got a minute? - I'm not going anywhere. - I've been partners with Special Agent Morgan Daniels for six years now and I was just wondering what happened to her? It's Bone isn't it. - I'm afraid Murph. - [Murphy] Of what? - I'm afraid Conn might have been right. About me not being able to cut it with the team. - That's nonsense. - Is it? Remember when we were under fire at the rendezvous point. We left him. I left him. - And you were right. We had to get back with the photos or the mission was a total bust. - That's what I said. That wasn't it. I got us out of there because I was afraid. I was afraid and I didn't wanna die. (suspenseful music) - So how do we get close to Kamal? - We need a diversion. - Are your people ready to fight? - We are Mujahideen, we are always ready to fight. - But Kamal fights with rockets and tanks. An attack would be suicide. - Not necessarily. What if we staged an attack on Kamal's forces when he's moving his camp. Attack at night. Do your people have RPG's? - Of course. - Alright we take out the lead and last vehicle in the column. Create as bottleneck with no chance of retreat. If we can identify Kamal's command vehicle, go in and make the snatch during the confusion. - It is possible. An attack on his armor would never be expected. And with Kamal removed, his organization would wither and die like a headless snake. - Once we have Kamal, your men can retreat and never be followed. - There is a problem with this plan. - And what's that? - It calls for us to retreat after we have snatched Kamal. - So? - We are Mujahideen, we do not retreat. But this time we make exception. (engine revving) - I've got a positive ID on Kamal's vehicle. When the fun starts follow me and move fast. Let's move to our positions. (guns clicking) (suspenseful music) (rocket whooshing) (explosion booms) (suspenseful music) (guns firing) (yelling) (rocket whooshing) (explosions booming) (guns firing) (engine revving) - Get out! Hold it Kamal, you're under arrest. (speaking in foreign language) Put it down Kamal. Out, out, out! What did he say? - I only took basic Arabic at Quantico, it was something about our positions. (rocket booms) It was "quick fire on my position!" - Get down! (explosions booming) (screams) - I got him. I'm gonna drop him. - What are you doing? We're bringing Kamal back alive. (whistles) - You guys lose something? This is bad. We might as well of stuck a firecracker in a hornets nest. Taliban are wigging out. Alright, there's our primary extraction point. Taliban are crawling all throughout this sector. - We're gonna have divert to the secondary. It's gonna be a long hump across enemy territory. We're never gonna get there alone. We need an escort. - No problem, I've cleared it with Akhbar, he'll give us some men. - Good, right through here. - What's wrong? - It is Abdul. - Is he dead? - No, not dead, not yet. But he is taken prisoner. He won't last long. I am going to save him. - That's suicide. - I have no choice. And you are coming with me. - Wait a minute, what the hell is going on here? - No no, please it is alright. I do not fear the words of a woman. But the four of you have brought this fight to us. Abdul's fate is linked with yours. And if you wish my help in reaching your extraction point, you will help us. - We'll help you. - This is crazy. - It's our only chance. I'm going too. - No Frank, you still with Kamal. I'll take Murphy. - Should we not take Frank? He is a mighty warrior, no? - Murphy doesn't look like much but actually he's the most courageous man on the team. He's killed over a dozen men with his bare hands. - This is good. - I still think this is crazy. We should just go with Kamal and take our chances. - Listen Daniels, we wouldn't have Kamal without these men. They risked their lives for us. I consider them part of the team. - We go. So Mr. Murphy, these 12 men, did you throttle them or merely snap their necks? - Um, that second one. - You ready for this? - Born ready. (suspenseful music) - There is the fort. - Okay, here's the plan. Murph take a position up there on the high ground. Cover the guard tower. Anybody moves, taken 'em out. - What I don't get to go in and snap any necks? - Maybe next time. (suspenseful music) - Abdul, Abdul. We have come for you. - He's gone. - I know. (melancholy music) I thank you American. Few would have the courage to come with me. - I'm sorry. - All men live, all men die. But Abdul has won an honored name. This will never die. Now I will return to my people. As is tradition I will lead them. On this day I have become a man. (guns firing) - You go, we will handle this. - Are you sure about that? - Do not insult us. Take this dog and go. - You heard the man. (guns firing) I'm gonna get some shut eye. You take the first watch. - May I ask you a question? What is it you are doing here? - Isn't it obvious by now? - My men will not give up. You will not leave this country alive. - Don't try and predict the future Kamal, it has a way of making a fool of you. - Fire is beautiful is it not. I like the way the light plays on your delicate skin. - And my eyes are Olympic pools, right? - What if I told you you didn't have to die? - I'm not planning on it. - Suppose you are right, suppose you escape, return to your country. Where the very fact that you are a woman will prevent you from achieving the success you crave. - What would you know about it? - I've seen the way your team treats you, they do not show you respect. - Right. I forgot how your culture respects women. - I am not like those savage Mujahideen. I would give you anything. Money. Jewels. A life of a Queen. Ah but these things are no interest to a modern woman? You want power. A word for me would install you as the head of the Afghani Secret Police. The whole nation would fear and respect you. You would have the power of life and death in your hands. - Hmm. Tempting. And what do I have to do? - One simple act of courage. Release me. I would even kill that one for you. I know you do not like him. Make the coward's choice and you die. Make the brave choice, the world is yours. - What do you think Kamal? That I'm one of your teenage boys waiting to be seduced with dreams of power and glory? All you extremist types think American's care for nothing but greed. Well I didn't join the FBI for money. So I'm not about to sell out to the likes of you. - (speaking in foreign language) You disappoint me. - I wouldn't have it any other way. - This is the rendezvous point. - The only question is where the hell are they? - Alright people that's the extraction point. I say we get the hell home. (suspenseful music) - The extraction points right over the top of that ridge. - I concur. What's the status of that chopper? - It's 10 miles out. Listen up people, the choppers gonna be low on fuel this far away from the carrier. We have a minute, maybe two. Get ready to move out. Whoa, whoa, whoa, we've got company. - I hate drop ins. Alright people lie low, they'll pass right by us. - One sound Kamal and your skull gets a very short physics lesson. (suspenseful music) (smoke hissing) (coughing) (yelling) (guns firing) - [Webb] There's the chopper. - Ha, it is too late for you. My men have seen you, they will slaughter you like dogs. - You get Kamal in the chopper. I'll take the rear guard. Morgan you're with me. - [Murphy] Morgan. - Get to the chopper go. (suspenseful music) (guns firing) (rotors whirring) - Commander intel says this area is a minefield. We're gonna have to extract you via spy rig. - I just ran across a minefield? - At least you didn't find out the hard way. (guns firing) - Commander we have to go now, where is the rest of your team? - They're coming. You will wait, that's an order. - You know how to use tear gas? - Duh. (gun fires) (smoke hisses) (coughing) (suspenseful music) - [Evacuator] We have to go commander. - [Webb] You'll wait til I tell you. - [Murphy] There they are. - That's the rest of team. Quick, come on. Okay guys clip in, clip in. Let's go. (rotors whirring) (coughing) - Hey Daniels. You did a good job back there. - From one professional to another. - Absolutely. - Is there a movie on this flight? (uplifting music) (rock music)
