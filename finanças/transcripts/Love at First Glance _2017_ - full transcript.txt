Mr. Kramer. I don't know if you remember me. I'm Mary Landers, reporter for The Bugle. I remember. Did you happen to see my article in The Bugle of the incursion of chipmunks in Hidden Hollow Park? Must have missed it. Well, with my investigative reporting, I exposed that the chipmunks are disturbing all the biological balance of all the fauna in the park. It's true, the squirrels are really upset. You interviewed squirrels? Well, actually, I interviewed a world renowned behaviorist from City College that did confirm that the squirrels are exhibiting signs of depression. It's all in the height of the tail. I'd love to come talk to you about some articles I'm thinking about. Keep up the good work. Thanks, sir. Have a great day. Well, at least he knows who I am. - Hey, Natalie. - Good morning. - Hey, Todd. - Good morning, Mary. - Morning, Sharon. - Hey. Keeping busy? Emergency closure on South Temple. They need to remove a dead tree. Stop the presses. What's wrong, Mary? I can't do this anymore. I'm going mad. - What are you talking about? - I can't write about this anymore. I can't write about yard sales and spelling bees. We all gotta start somewhere. We've been doing this for six years now. Okay? I went to journalism school. I hardly think my professors thought my big breaking story would be writing about a sign on Gino's Pizzeria that's keeping the residents awake at night. The neighborhood was very grateful. Besides, I thought you were gonna talk to Jack Kramer over at the Gazette. I did. And? Let's just say he's not overly impressed with my investigative reporting on chipmunks. It was a story that needed to be told. I am dying here. I feel like I'm standing still. What do you say we... we go out tonight? Have some margaritas. Who know, maybe we'll get lucky, and we'll witness a robbery or something. You'll be off and running. Can't. Going out with Carl. Said he had something important to tell me. I bet he's gonna propose. - You think so? - Well, I mean, it's been five years. - And he's not gonna do better than you. Oh, Connie. I want you to go talk to the washroom attendants at The Drake. They still have washroom attendants? Yes, and they're very upset. Go on, I know you have it in you. Make it special. Mary. - Yeah, Wally. - I have a special assignment for you. - Really? - This is gonna be front page stuff. - Really? - It's for our Valentine's Day issue. Really. You look disappointed. It's just that does the public really need to know that candy corn Cupids are gonna be all the rage at Taffy Town? No, I'm thinking more of a meditation on love. Give me your take on the true meaning of love. You want me to write about the true meaning of love. In 3,000 words. - But, Wally, I... - Go on, I know you have it in you. Make it special. Okay. I don't know why I bother to look at this menu. We always order the same thing. Cheese ravioli for two. I guess you could call us boring. Set in our ways. Right, Carl? Never mind. Hi. I know what we want. We're gonna get the cheese ravioli, please, and, I... I would love a little bit more water. Actually, I'm gonna have the chicken risotto. And, tiramisu for the lady, please. Thank you. - What's going on, Carl? - What do you mean? You just ordered the chicken risotto. We always get the cheese ravioli. Yeah... I think I can explain. Look, I want to tell you something that happened last week. Does this have to do with the chicken risotto? In a way, yes. So, Tim Wood came in. You know who Tim Wood is, right? - He's one of your customers? - Yes, a very good customer. Every three years for the last 15 years, he's leased the same car from me. A four-door, kid friendly, brand new navy blue sedan. Every three years, same car, same features. But last Thursday, you know what he did? I haven't the slightest idea. He bought a brand new convertible sports car. Just like that, he walked in and... and just... and just got a red convertible. What does this have to do with the chicken risotto? It has to do with change, Mary. It was in that moment, that very moment, that Tim Wood bought that convertible that I had my road to Damascus moment. Road to Damascus? I remembered then what my father used to say to me. If you don't like something, change it. Not quite Mark Twain, but okay, fine. Get your risotto. I don't think you understand, Mary. I'm sorry, Mary, I just don't think that we should see each other anymore. Sorry. What'd you say? There has to be more to life than cheese ravioli. I don't understand, Carl. We've been together for five years. You've always loved cheese ravioli. I'm bored, Mary. I need... I need some excitement in my life. What are you saying, I'm boring? No, I... Call me crazy, but I'd like to date someone who didn't know what they want to order without looking at the menu. Fine, I'll change my order. I'll change. Okay? Where's the waitress? I'll have the manicotti. This is bigger than manicotti. Look, you... you're a great gal. I just lately have been thinking that I need something different, something less... predictable. Predictable? I just wrote an investigative piece on depressed chipmunks... Squirrels. Squirrels. Don't tell me that is predictable. Mary, I need... I need someone that when she walks in the room, I get butterflies in my stomach. But we live in the same building, Carl. Don't you think it would be awkward if we broke up? Yeah, you're right about that. I think you should move. But it's almost Valentine's Day. - Here you go. - It'll... Hi. We're actually gonna get that to go, if that's okay. Thanks. Aviation Way. Next stop, First Avenue. Wait! You forgot your phone. Sorry. Shoot. Excuse me. I'd like to turn this in. Lost property, form F2108. It's not a lost property. I found this phone, and I just want to give it back. Yeah, we don't have a form for that. - What do you mean? - Look, lady, I work for the transit system. People don't just turn property in around here. - Well, what is all that stuff? - Every night, we clean the train cars. And every night we find phones, keys, baby bottles, you name it. What can I say? It all ends up... Here. You know what? Never mind. I'm gonna take the phone and try to find him myself. - What's wrong? - Carl broke up with me. Yes! I mean, no, no, no, that is so bad. - Man. - You hated him. I don't hate him, I just... I think you can do better. What happened? He said he wants something different. What am I supposed to do? How am I supposed to be any different in my life? Well, you could start with changing those shoes, they're horrible. He says I'm predictable. Am I predictable? Predictably wonderful. You're so sweet. You always say the nicest things to me. That's because you're a good person, Mary. Hey. Hey. You're a good person. I am a good person. - Yeah. - I am. I do really nice things for people, like... if somebody's checking out, I'll let them check out in front of me at the grocery store with one item. And I donate all my clothes to Goodwill. Connie, she sends me all these videos, thousands every day, and I always tell her thank you for them. And you probably don't know this, but I put nickels on the sidewalk just so people can find them. Is that why Mr. Gilbert is always looking at the ground in front of the building? Who am I kidding? Who's gonna fall in love with me? Really? Hundreds of guys. I mean, there's thousands. Name one. Okay... Mr. Vornado. - My dry cleaner? - Yeah. He's always had a thing for you. No, no, no, I'm not crossing that line. He is the best dry cleaner in the city. Do you know how hard it is to find a good dry cleaner? - I mean, that guy is a genius... - Fine, fine, fine, fine. You're never gonna find love ever again, and you're just gonna live alone with cats the rest of your life. Congratulations. - Will I? - Seriously really? You know what? Jack Kramer, he just needs to give me that job at The Gazette, and then my life will be changed, and I will be different. What, no, no, what are you doing? You are not texting the guy that broke your heart. - No, no, give me... - No, relax, it's not... it's not my phone. This is... I found this on the subway. This guy... I just want to find his contacts so I can give it back to him. - The security code. - Try 1234. How did you know that? 'Cause it's everybody's security code. It says if you find it, contact James Fielding. He's on South State Street. 555-0127. Give me your phone. Okay. Hey, it's James. I'm out of the country, so don't leave a message. I will see you after my latest adventure. My latest adventure? Who is this guy, Marco Polo? I mean, look at him. Look. He dives with sharks. - Whoa. - He... He jumps off cliffs. He runs with... He runs with the bulls. This is the perfect guy for you. Victor, my boyfriend just broke up with me. This might be a crazy idea, but... do you know who he's the perfect guy for? - Who? - The Gazette. The Gazette? Wh... The Gazette is always looking to find new interesting people to profile. I could just write a story on him. That would be a good way in. Did you not just hear the part about him being out of the country? What if he turns out to not even be an interesting person? Is that a real lion? Yeah. It's Mr. Gilbert. - What is he doing? - He's looking for nickels. Is that my future? Looking for nickels in the junipers? He texted. What do I do? You sent an emoji of a pumpkin? He's gonna think I'm a total lunatic. Yeah, or festive. "Yes, I have your phone". "Are you the girl on the train?" He remembers me. "The one with the red shoes eating dessert?" Please tell me you were not eating cheesecake in public again. It was the tiramisu from Nino's Amore. I couldn't resist. Give me your phone. He says he's in the airport heading to Paris. He says he uses it for international travel. This guy's like James Bond. He says he wants to meet me. What do I say? "Yes, I can meet you. When?" "Back on February 14th". - Valentine's Day? - Yeah, what do you care? You're not gonna be busy. He wants you to hold onto his phone until then. Uh, "where should we meet?" Question mark. - "Kimi's, 9 p. m". - Kimi's, Kimi's. Kimi's? Yeah, the place by my old apartment. Yeah, yeah, I love that place. Okay. What are you typing? I'm asking him if it's okay if you write a story on him. What's he saying? He wants to know what kind of story. Okay. Tell him I'm a very important reporter working for an internationally recognized newspaper, and I write profiles on interesting people. Pretty sure the staff of The Bugle, circulation 142, is gonna believe that one. Just type that. He's saying, "What makes you think I'm so interesting?" "Just a hunch. "I would like to get to know you better to make sure". - No. - Send. No! Don't send that. Victor. That is so embarrassing. I'm just gonna crawl in a hole and die of embarrassment. "You have everyone I know in your hands. Go for it". "Go for it"? Hey, Mom. - There you are. - Hi. You're an hour late. Hey, where's Carl? - We broke up. - I'm sorry. You career girls, all work and no time for romance. - Carl broke up with me, Aunt Pam. - So, are you seeing anyone new? It's been less than 24 hours. Hi, Uncle Bill. Hi. She got dumped. She's single. Still single. Happy birthday, Dad. Thank you, sweetheart. - Are you okay? - Yeah. Why? Just surprised about you and Carl, that's all. You know, I think... he thinks I'm boring. - Why, that is ridiculous. - No, I think he's right. About being boring? I think I'm bored. But I'm gonna do something to change that. Like what? I'm gonna find a great guy. And then I'm gonna be everything he wants in a girl and more. And we're gonna fall madly in love. - And then what? - What do you mean? You become the girl that this great guy of yours is looking for, and then what? Well, we'll live happily ever after. So, this new guy of yours gets the girl of his dreams. What, Mom? You're doing that... that nod, that... You have that look. It just seems to me that in your happily ever after, you lose. Lose what? Yourself. Who you really are, what you really want, what you really need. To find real love, Mary, you have to love yourself first. It will come to you. But true love doesn't fall for disguises. It sees right through them. So you just be your authentic, wonderful self. And it'll come. - Now, come on. - Okay. - Happy birthday to you... - Happy birthday to me... - Happy birthday to you - Happy birthday to me Good morning, sir. So what I want to do is I want to paint a portrait of a man by interviewing his friends, family, co-workers, acquaintances, see him through the prism of their eyes. - Sounds like an obit. - No, no, no, no, no. No. Well, think of it like a living obit. Living obit. That's original, Landers. And trust me, sir, this man who I want to write about is very much alive. Very, very much. Here. That a real lion? I think this piece would be really great in your new millennial section. What do you think? Don't you have another job, Landers? Yes, I do. I work for The Bugle. And I am working on an article right now on the meaning of love. Let me guess. The Valentine's Day issue. Okay, then, thanks for your time, sir. Landers. Follow me. Look at that photo. What do you see? He didn't have as much gray hair? No, look. Go on, get closer. I don't know what you want me to see. Hunger. That's what I want you to see. Hunger. Look at that guy in that photo. Does that guy look like he would take no for an answer? - I really want to do this story, sir. - Oh, for cryin' out loud, Landers. You gotta fight for it. I really, really want to do this story, sir, and prove to you that I can work at The Gazette. Jeez Louise, you call that fighting? Go on, get out of here. Does that mean I can do the story? Yeah, yeah. Go ahead, write it. See where it goes. Thanks again for meeting me. May I? Thanks. So, like I mentioned, I found your number in James' phone, and I'm trying to interview everyone who knows him to see what kind of man he is. And does James know you're doing this? Yes. In fact, he told me to go for it. That does sound like James. He's a very generous person. An extraordinary man. And he has the potential to be a great tango dancer. So James is a dancer? Actually, he's a photojournalist. He came here to do a story about the tango, and quickly became enchanted with our world. So, what makes James a good dancer? The tango is a game of allurement. It begins in the eyes. In a glance. The dance epitomizes the dancer's loneliness and secret desires. Tell me, Miss Landers, have you ever danced the tango? Me? No, no, no, I don't dance. Everyone must dance. Everyone has a dance inside them. Honestly, I have two left feet. I don't... I... Last time I danced was at my cousin Ronnie's wedding. We did the line dance from "Footloose", and they actually asked me to leave the dance floor. Once in your lifetime, you must dance the tango. Cesar. Come. - What? - Yes. Come, come. No, I think I should go. I don't think so. - Oh, my... - Don't think. Just feel. Oh, my gosh, what is happening right now? Just fall into my arms. Just so you know, I have a 4:42 train to catch back. Nothing else matters. Because tonight... we have the tango. Mary, you are a natural tango dancer. - I am? - Goddess. Powerful. Graceful. Beautiful. Let's tango! Hey, Carl. Seriously, Victor, Carl's face was amazing. I was doing this tango move in the elevator, and the door opens, he's just standing there, I'm, like, "Oh, hi, Carl". And the door closes before he can say anything. Oh, man. Green. - Pink. - Thank you. - So, how was it? - What? - Running into Carl again? - I don't know. It's strange when you see someone every day for so long, and then suddenly you don't. But it was okay. I was okay. I think. I'm not sure I was ever in love with him, Victor. I'm not sure I've ever been in love. But isn't it funny that Wally's got me writing this story on love? I mean, what if I find it? That will be news. Especially to me. - Green. - Yellow. Guess what? I got another lead - ... with the Gazette story. - Who? All I know is her name is China Howe. China Howe. She sounds like a spy. Look. Mystery girl. - Spy. - Spy. She said she had a complicated relationship with him. - And the plot thickens. - Yeah, let's hope so. Quiet down, guys. - Boy, you have a lot of dogs. - I know. You like dogs, right? I never had a pet growing up, so honestly, they are... they scare me a little. Oh, no, they're not gonna hurt you. They're nothin' but love. Give me a kiss. Dogs are my life. You know what? Dogs saved my life. - Actually, James saved my life. - When did you meet? Five years ago. Okay, medium rare hamburger. But I ordered a mushroom omelet. You... you did. Okay. I will fix that. One second. Okay? - Where are my... - Okay, just give me... Just give me a second. Okay? - I ordered a tuna sandwich. - I'll be right with you. - What else can I get for you? - I haven't actually ordered yet. Just admit it, I'm a terrible waitress. No, you're probably just having a bad day. No, I'm just really bad at this. You know what? I hate it. I dread coming to work. Tell me something. Do you know Confucius? Yeah, he was a regular, and then I gave him a milkshake, so now he goes to the bagel shop down the street. - You're funny. - They think I'm a riot. No, Confucius said, "The man who finds a job that he loves "never works a day in his life". So, what do you like? What do I like? No, no, what do you love more than anything? Toast. Okay, I don't really see a career path in that, but toast is good. I like Monopoly. The yellow properties are the best because nobody ever lands on them. - Have you noticed? - Wow, that's an interesting strategy. I love dogs. That's what I love more than anything. Am I crazy? I've gotta get somebody's scrambled eggs. I'll probably mess it up. Hard to mess up scrambled eggs. Watch me. What can I get for you? - Cup of coffee would be great. - Okay, one iced tea coming up. - China. - Hot chocolate. - Really? - Sorry, Bill. You said James rescued you. How did he do that? He just knows how to see people for who they really are, and it's enough. He taps into all those places in your heart that we just long to have touched, you know? - Hey. - Hey. - What happened? - I got fired. Something about messing up a patty melt. - That's rough. - It's not the first time. Yeah. What are you gonna do? Find another crappy waitress job. By tomorrow. Come with me. I want to show you something. Let me take you somewhere. That same day, James took me to a place that changed my life. Within a week, I had traded in first acts and scrambled eggs for something that became my life's passion. How do you even know about this organization? I had a girlfriend once. Needed a dog. Thank you, James. Why did it end with the two of you? Carey. I think to really understand James, you have to know what happened with Carey. Who knows? Maybe if James and I met now instead of then, we'd still be together. Don't get me wrong. I love him. I always will. He's the one who led me to what I love in life, and really, isn't that what it's all about? I can't believe this is all yours. I couldn't have done it without James. He likes you. You guys are meant to be. Come on, baby. - Mary. - Hey, Carl. Hi. - What's wrong? - Whose dog is this? This is my new dog. Boyfriend. - Boyfriend? - Say hi to Carl, my ex-boyfriend. Hi. Hi. Okay. I'm really confused here because you always said that you hated dogs. When we were together, I always wanted to get a dog, and you would always say "Over my dead body". I'm sorry. Yeah. What can I say? Ready to go? Ready to go home? Okay. Come on. Come on. Here we go. Say goodbye to Carl, Boyfriend. Bye, Boyfriend. Dad, what are you doing? It doesn't need to be so perfect. This is the way I like it. I like it just in nice lines, clean, symmetrical, so it's all going in the same direction. They're just leaves, sweetheart. We sweep them away. Some blow back. More fall off the tree, and then we do it all over again. Life is messy. By the way, how's work going? I'm supposed to be writing a story on the meaning of love. You know, in the last few weeks, I've realized I have no clue what love means. Maybe you just need to change the way you look at things. 35 years ago, my car broke down, and I went into a dress shop to answer the phone, and there was your mother. Unexpected. Love is just that way. Unexpected. It's from James. "Greetings from Paris where it is beautiful and romantic". Isn't Paris always romantic? "Ever been"? No. I've never left the U.S. But a girl can dream. "What's in your dreams?" God, what is it about this guy that makes me want to tell him everything? James and I worked in a photo lab. Back then, I barely left my house. I just went to work and came home and played video games. Then one day, James brought me up here. He told me I needed to step out of my comfort zone. The guy showed me how to love life, and look at me now. Shall we? I don't think so! I'm scared! - Come on! - I'm just scared of... - Goggles, goggles. - Goggles, goggles. - Hey. Really? - Yeah. - Oh, my gosh. - Come on. Oh, my gosh. All right, here I go. I love James. - Thank you. - You're welcome. I don't see him enough. He's always off somewhere on some great adventure taking pictures. - How did you meet James? - We were neighbors. You know, back then, we used to help me around the house... you know, little things like carry in the groceries or fix a broken faucet. He liked my son Daniel. When I met James, Daniel was only 8. Daniel used to love to play this old keyboard. He used to play the same songs over and over again. You know, some nights, when I had to work late, James would look after Daniel, and he would listen to him play this keyboard. He loved it. You know, the truth is he saw something in my child I didn't even see. One day I came home from work, and Daniel was sitting at this beautiful piano. It was a gift from James. No one had ever done anything like that for me. You know, what kind of man cares for another's child like that? James used to sit right here and watch him play. And before you knew it, my child got pretty good. Okay, now leave some gaps and spaces so you can do something unexpected. Not quite that unexpected. - What's wrong, Daniel? - I can't do it. - Do what? - Be great at this. I want to be the greatest there ever was. Do you know who Ralph Waldo Emerson is? He was a poet, a writer, a great writer. You know what he said? Nothing great is ever achieved without enthusiasm. Show me some enthusiasm. Huh? Show me some greatness. That's it. Now take it from the top. 5, 6, 7, 8! Go! Ha ha! There you go. Yeah. Now we're feeling it. - So where's Daniel now? - He goes to Julliard. And next month, he'll play a concert - at Carnegie Hall. - What? James said he would be there. Wow. Oh, gosh. It's just so funny because I don't even know him, but everyone in James' life makes me love him more and more. - It's crazy, right? - Not really. Every day I just want to hear more about his acts of kindness, his sense of adventure, his total fearlessness. You know, the one thing you'll learn about James is that it all comes from a place deep in his heart. And for me, it wasn't about him buying a piano. It was about the time that he spent at this piano with my child. It's about the groceries he carried on. It's about him teaching us the truth about living a worthwhile life. That love is everything. - Hi. - Hi. I've separated out the green ones for you. This is why I love you. - You working tonight? - Valentine's Day sale. -40% off everything in the store. - Are the sandals I love on sale? Literally, the only pair of shoes in the store not on sale. How is a girl supposed to live? - Want to have lunch tomorrow? - Can't. I'll be out of town. - What are you doing? - The James story. Well, actually, I'm going to meet this girl Carey, but the funny thing is, when I called her, this guy Matthew answered her cell phone and said he'd explain everything when I got there. - Alan broke up with Sharon. - I heard. The latest bid for the dress on eBay: 38 bucks. And Natalie from accounting is getting married. You're thinking about Carl. No. Actually, I'm thinking about what he said when we broke up. He said he wants excitement. He said he wants to feel butterflies in his stomach when the girl of his dreams walks in the room. Mary, in the last week, you've jumped out of an airplane, danced the night away with some Casanova, and got a dog. Don't you see? You're not the girl that Carl broke up with. - You've changed. - I know. Trust me. No matter how much I've changed, nobody's going to feel butterflies when I walk in a room. You're the one that needs to feel the butterflies. All that matters is what you feel. And when you feel that crazy stirring inside you... you'll know. You'll know you've finally found the right one. Here. I got you something. For me? "For the girl who always picks out the green candy hearts". - Aw, thank you. - Don't get too excited. Between the 40% off sale and my employee discount, it was practically free. Thank you. You are such a prince. Thanks for meeting me. Always happy to help a fellow journalist. May I? - Please. - Thanks. So you're a journalist, Matthew? I'm a nurse, but I cover Pee Wee football for the local paper. Do you work at a hospital? Center For Brain Injury and Rehabilitation at Castle Rock. - And where did you meet James? - At Castle Rock. You said on the phone you haven't seen him for a while. We text, but I think, at the end of the day, it's still just too painful for him. James hasn't had the easiest life. James' mother was very devoted to her son. For Diana Fielding, the son rose and set on her only child. Make sure you get glue all over the heart. Okay? - Then the glitter? - Then the glitter. Hello. Hey, buddy. Look at that. That looks fantastic. - Hi, sweetheart. - Hi, babe. Nice to see you. I'll make a quick call and be back. I'll be right there. You're doing such a good job. I love you. Mama, will we keep this forever? Every year on Valentine's Day, we'll put it on the mantel for everybody to see because it is the most beautiful valentine I have ever seen. And then, when you're all grown up and you fall in love, you can give it to the person you love. What do you mean? Well, some day, you're going to fall in love and get married, and you'll have your own traditions, just like we have. Good job, James. Let me get some more milk. - I want to come with you. - You've got to stay here and make sure Daddy doesn't eat all of our cookies. Daddy's here. Come sit over here. Work on your valentine. I'll be right back. Okay? James. I'll love you forever and ever. Those words, "forever and ever", stayed with James his entire life. James' mother died instantly, leaving behind only James and his father Marshall. That is so tragic. Their lives were forever changed. James' father Marshall was a successful businessman. He worked a lot of long hours, leaving James home alone to think about what had been lost. May I be excused? Finish your dinner first. For many months, James felt very alone. That was, until he met Carey. - What's wrong, James? - Nothing. Don't you like making valentines? That's all right. You don't have to. We can just sit here. Besides, I like Easter much better than Valentine's Day. Don't you, James? On Easter I get to wear my big straw hat and eat lots and lots of chocolate and paint eggs every color under the rainbow. Tell me, James. Tell me you like Easter best of all. - Tell me, James. - I like Easter best of all. - Louder. I can't hear you. - I like Easter best of all. I can't hear you. I like Easter best of all! After that day, they were the best of friends. - They were rarely apart. - That's sweet. Seems like he was lucky to have her. You know, I think that's the wonderful thing about love because it's just a great a gift for the giver as it is for the one who receives it. Their lives were never the same. They went to college together. Then, after four years, they moved back into the city, rented a little house. I remember James was a portrait photographer back then, and Carey used to bake and sell pies for the local restaurants. They were very much in love. They talked about getting married. And just one day, everything changed. - Slow down, Carey! - Come on, slowpoke! Here I come! Only 2 more miles! Only 2 more miles? You're killing me. Come on! - Come on, James! - Carey! Come on, James. I believe in you. Carey! He never left her side. For the first eight months, he was there day and night. But the Carey he knew... was no longer there. Come on, Carey. Tell me you like Easter best of all. What? I can't hear you. Come on. Tell me you like Easter best of all. Tell me you like Easter best of all. After a while, she started to walk again, but the damage was done. The doctors said the traumatic brain injury she suffered caused retrograde amnesia. She remembered nothing about her life before the accident. I was her nurse. We worked hard to get some of her memory back. But those past memories only seemed to agitate her. James was a stranger to her. After a while, she told him he didn't need to visit anymore. So he stayed away for a few weeks, but on the day she was released... So what's the first thing you're going to do when you get out of here? Go to the movies. - The movies? - Yes. You promised me when I took my first step you were going to take me to the movies. That I did. So I'm going to hold you to that, Matthew McGuire. It's really the first thing you want to do? A scary movie. Okay. Now I don't know if I can handle that. Don't worry. I'll hold your hand. Come on, Matthew. I promise we'll have fun. On that day... he let her go. He loved her that much. Her just let her go. After that day, his heart shattered into a million pieces. He was fragile for a long time. But I like to think that James is the man he is today because of that broken heart... never sitting still, always looking around the corner for that next adventure. Running from the pain? Maybe. Has there been anyone else for James since Carey? No. No one serious. For a long time, I just don't think he was ready. But lately I've noticed something changing in him. I mean, call me an old-fashioned optimist, but I like to think that a broken heart can be healed and that a healed heart can love deeper and more fully than ever before. I'm going to show you something. Here are some photos that James took recently in Paris. Maybe it's just me, but this looks like somebody who's ready to love again. Come on. I want you to meet Carey and our son. Hey, sport, come here. - Hey. - Look at him. He's a good-looking kid, right? - How's the soccer going? - Great. - Come on. - Hey. - Hello. - Hello. All right, let's see what you've been learning. Okay, Bobby. Nice kick. I guess I haven't been much help with your story. We have a saying with writers: what you leave out is as important as what you leave in. Well, in my case, I didn't choose what to leave out. It was just taken from me. People tell me... James and I were close once. I suppose it's true. Sometimes, really late at night... or early in the morning, I get this... I get this sense of... of something... something... like I have this one brief memory of a Valentine's Day with James. I woke up really early that morning, and James had made me pancakes and coffee. And there on the mantel was a homemade valentine with lots and lots of red glitter all over it. It was like a child had made it. And on the valentine were the words "I will always love you forever and ever". And I remember I... I really liked it because it felt so special, so important. But then I don't remember anything else. I just don't remember. It's just a sample of how the piece is going. I mean, obviously, I have a lot more work to do, but I think it captures the essence of... Sorry. The meaning of love. Mary, I feel your heart isn't in this one. That's not true. Mary, do you remember when Natalie in accounting cried over that article you wrote about the beauty contestant with the broken leg? Everybody liked that one. Well, her talent was tap-dancing. It wrote itself. But what we need to find here is a little heart. Ask yourself this. What is it about love that unlocks the mysteries of the human heart? I want to tell you a story, a story about love. Please, take a seat. Once, long ago, when I was about your age, I had two girlfriends. Wally. Yes, it's true. One you know: my lovely wife Ann. But there was this terrific girl Barbara who I was also seeing at the same time. And on one Valentine's Day, Barbara came over and gave me a gift. It was a very expensive cashmere sweater. And she wanted me to wear it to her parents' house that night. But I knew I could never wear that sweater. - Why? You didn't like it? - No. It was a lovely sweater. But it wasn't really for me. It was for Barbara... to make her feel better about herself. Later that same day, my beautiful Ann came over with a plate of homemade cookies, just like these. And you know, it was at that moment that I really understood the true meaning of love. It was a girl who put so much care and love into what she did for me that I could finally understand this simple truth. At the end of the day, what gives our lives meaning is how we are loved. You need to tell your story, Mary. Tell a story about how someone or something changed your life and made you reject that cashmere sweater for something much more. Please help yourself. Thanks. Amazing. You married her after eating these cookies? I know. She can't cook a lick. But boy, she loves me like no other. - Hey, Dad. - Hey. I just love this smell. Well, you've spent more than one Saturday afternoon in here playing with your dolls. Is this for Mom? My valentine, always and forever. Hand me that piece of glass there, will you? Thank you. Careful. That flower's older than you are. Really? Remember I told you how I met your mother that day. My car broke down? Well, that day, she gave me this flower. She gave you a flower? Your mother was never the shy, retiring type, not then, not now. She saw something she wanted, she went after it. I was lucky my car broke down that day, and I was really lucky that she liked what she saw when I walked into that dress shop. Dad, you're going to make me cry. What is that song? I love that song. We used to dance to this when you were about that high. You put your little feet on top of mine, and off we'd go. - Dad, you want to do that again? - Sure. Now be light on your feet. Here we go, got it... Hey, Mary. Hey. Excuse me, I need to... Yeah, thanks. Mary, wait, this isn't your floor. Wha... Don't need any of these anymore. Time to move on. Clearly, you're my only boyfriend. Goodnight, boyfriend. Butterflies. I see you're enjoying James's photography. Yes, very much. He is a very talented young man. That's taken from a series in Africa. He travels the globe and he always comes back with the most wonderful images. Here is when he was driving through the Masai national reserve. Notice how the color here depends heavily on the angle of the sun and the perspective of the photographer. He took this in Paris. You're familiar with this photograph? Yes. A friend of James' showed me this recently. It's one of my favorites. It's entitled, "Hopeful". Would you like to see some new works from James? Sure. This one's called, "Girl with Red Shoes". Perhaps it should be called "Hopeful". Well, to answer your question, I spent 35 years in corporate America. I missed seeing my son grow up. So when I finally retired, I discovered my passion. I like to get on my hog, and hit the highway. You know, just ride. And I found out that it was a fantastic way for me to bond with my son, because James loves to adventure. I love adventure, so on the weekends, we take our bikes out, and we ride. We ride for hours. And its a great way for us to catch up. Do you regret the years you missed watching him grow up? Once, when James was, like, 20, and I'd been absent for years, I called him one night. I was sick, I had a fever, some kind of a flu, and I needed someone to come over and take care of me. He showed up. Wow, you don't look so good. All right. And that was the night that everything finally made sense. There you go. Drink up. That he had real faith in our future together. Well... it touched me. It touched me immeasurably. And so to answer your question, no. No regrets, but... Lessons learned. You're a natural. Here we go. - That was fun. - It was a great time. Great ride. Next weekend? - Sound good. Night. - Goodnight. - Thank you. - You bet. Hi, Carl. Really? A motorcycle? Nothing. Hey. Don't you just love this place? Well, um... I suppose. Look at this sea urchin, it is so tender. Naw. No. What happened to your love of cheese ravioli? I'm good. Well... like you, I had my Road to Damascus moment. Say, did you hear that Tim Wood returned that red convertible I sold him? No. Yeah, he said, he said "I don't know what I was thinking I'm a blue sedan guy". Mary, you can't... No, I'm good. You can't imagine the amount of paperwork I generated to return that car. Let me tell you, we're talking loads and loads of forms. First I've ever had to return. Although this one time I did have a customer, Garfield, I think was his name. He... - Carl? - Yeah? I used to have dreams about us. I had so many ideas of what our future would be like. But knowing what I know now, and knowing who I am now, I just, I just can't figure out what that future would be like. What are you saying, Mary? Is it, is it over between us? - Yes. - I mean, like, really? I guess this means you're going to want me to move out of the building now, right? No. It's okay for you to stay right where you are. The end. Night, Mary. Leaving? - Yeah. - Where you heading? I'm getting ready to spend another Valentine's day alone. You? - You seem surprised. - Well, I am. It's been the same thing year after year. I think the last time I got a valentine was in the third grade. Night, Mary. Wait. Happy Valentine's Day, Connie. Thank you. Thank you very much. Happy Valentine's Day, Mary. I love those balloons. Can you believe tomorrow's Valentine's Day? Tomorrow, I meet James. You nervous? - A little. - Don't be. He's gonna love you and he's gonna love the article you wrote about him for the Gazette. Didn't I tell you? I wrote it for the Bugle. Finding the phone on the train changed my life. I realize I was only with Carl because it was comfortable. And everyone expected Carl and I to be together, to get engaged, to get married, to have children, and I just figured since it was expected, it was right. Don't get me wrong, I like Carl. But, it wasn't love. Love isn't always comfortable. It sneaks up on you. Sometimes when you're not even looking. It's unexpected, like what my dad said. Speaking of unexpected, did you know that Connie at your office told everyone on Facebook that you gave her a valentine? Box of chocolates. You gave her the box of chocolates? I was really looking forward to that nougat. Seeing how James lived his life made me want to live mine differently. I don't want to be comfortable. I want something... - Unexpected? - Unexpected. Yes. Is that the Bugle? "And love is opening our hearts to any possibility, no matter how unexpected". Oh, man, I wish I would've found a phone on a train. - I'm proud of you. - You're proud of me? Someone said to go for it, and you dove in and you went for it. Thanks. Was it finding the phone? I think it was the butterflies. That was a close one. What are you doing here, Landers? Shouldn't you be in the park chasing a squirrel for an exclusive? Did you happen to read my article on the meaning of love? - I did. - What did you think? Don't take this the wrong way, but I hate your style. How could I possibly take that the wrong way? Just too rainbows and fluffy clouds and cinnamon scones for my taste. You know, all that touchy-feely crap. Okay, so you hate touchy-feely. That would be incorrect. I loathe touchy-feely. You hated my article that much? Come on, Landers, I didn't say that. The whole things works. It's the kind of thing readers will eat up. Sid Kaplan at my feature desk... is moving to Florida. Are you offering me a job? Did I say that? Yes, you did. You're offering me a job. What do you think? The woman who sold me this said that I look like a strong, independent woman. You look like a strong independent woman who ripped down her drapes and cut out a dress. It's 8:35. You're gonna be late. - It's effortless. - No, absolutely not. Why? You can't wear ripped jeans on the first date, babe. It's technically not a first date. It's a date. Please tell me this works. You look... perfect. - Really? - Yeah. Yes. It's 8:44, you gotta go. - I have to go. - Bye. - Have fun. - Thank you. Hi, I'm going to Kim's on Third and Temple. Can we hurry? I'm sorry, I'm already running late. Thank you. Can you go any faster? I'm so late! All right, you know what? I think I'm just gonna get out and run the rest of the way there. Oh no, I'm too late. I missed him. Excuse me. Where is the guy that was sitting there? I don't know, lady, we get a lot of people in here. Think. What happened to him, where did he go? There was some guy there. I don't know where he went. What did he look like? - He was wearing pants. - Wearing pants? Was he handsome, did he have really pretty blue eyes? - I don't remember. - Don't remember? Listen, that guy is the reason that I found myself. Before I met him, I lived a life of caution. Always second guessing everything. I was a girl whose idea of a fun, wild night was sneaking a wine cooler into a 4 P.M. showing of "Eat Pray Love". - I love Julia Roberts. - Everybody loves Julia Roberts. My point is, because of that amazing, handsome, loving, generous, kind man, I dance the tango. I jumped out of an airplane, and I got a dog. Oh, geez. You just let him walk out the door and walk out of my life. This is all my fault. - You know what my problem is? - You like to talk to strangers? Don't you get it? After all that searching for the story of James Fielding, the story I actually found was my own. I found myself, I found my strength, I found my happiness. And I found the man for me. Lady, are you gonna order something? I know what you're gonna say. James Fielding doesn't even know you exist. What's wrong with Carl? Carl wants you back. I should've just gone back to Carl. Carl is the place to go, right? - I don't know a Carl, sorry. - I don't want Carl! Okay, lady, please don't cry. The truth is, I've fallen in love, and found out sometimes you fall in love with the most unexpected person, at the most unexpected time, and you do the most unexpected things. You know what I mean? I mean, I already have a girlfriend, her name's Marisol, and she's really jealous. So I really don't want any trouble. You know, at the end of the day, I've come all this way, and I've finally found myself. And I'm left with the scariest part of my journey. Am I bold enough? Am I brave enough? Am I crazy enough to fall in love? I think we're both crazy enough. Valentine's day is almost over. No, we still have 10 more minutes. - I have a present for you. - For me? It's what I've always wanted. Take a look. I have something for you, too. Close your eyes. Okay, open. Happy Valentine's Day. Happy Valentine's Day. You asked me a while ago what was in my dreams. I think it was this.
