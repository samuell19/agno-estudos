Oh, shit. Beth, you scared me. -I told you not to come up here alone. -Why? I knew what I was looking for. I was just trying to save you some time. -I know. I just-- it's-- this is... - What? -It's my home, okay? My things... -Well, these aren't. These are all of ours. - Fine, but it's just... It's not that safe up here. I know what I'm doing, you don't so... -Oh, my god. I'm-- I'm not-- I'm not here for your wine collection. I... I came to look at the trunk, get the things. I was closing it and you came up. -Yeah. -What is your point, Beth? Because you always have one. -Just that... it's my house. You should let me do it. I know where things are. -Okay. Shit. Whatever. -And can you not swear around my daughter? Please. -She's not even here. She's not even in the house. Didn't Trent take her to his parents' house for the weekend? -Yes, I know, but you do. I mean, you have in the past so I'm just saying, in general, please refrain. -Yes. Yes. Are you coming? -Yeah, just want to straighten this out. -Straighten what out? -Just... the mess you made. -Oh, for fuck-- Cool. You do that. I'm gonna go get the... It can be a body thing and a face thing. - But also... - Yeah. Yeah, like the face thing is. Yeah, I've heard about that. That's actually a good name. -Hi. -Hi there, guys. How you doing? -We're good, Tess. How've you been? -Good. Everything's great. -Yeah, Beth said, uh, what chip did you get? How many months was it? Was it six or nine? Six? -What? It's... it's a good thing, right? -I'm sorry. Was it a secret? -No, it's not a secret. -No, it's a good thing. And yes, it's been six months. -She's teaching a defense class... in Hollywood at the Y. Isn't that awesome? -I'm not teaching in Hollywood at all or at the Y. But I am teaching at Baldwin Hills. It's an elementary school. It's fun. I'm like Mister Miyagi with tits. What's not landing for you? Miyagi or tits? One's from The Karate Kid and the other one's... you know. -You got 'em, you know. -Uh, well, we're gonna go freshen up before we hit the road, if that's all right? - Yeah, of course. - Cool. -We'll leave soon. -You invited them here to the house? -Yeah. -I thought we said we were going to drive together. Alone. -We-- we can. I just said they could go with us in one car to make it easy, but if that's not okay, we can just-- -God... - What? -Nothing. You just never do what you say, that's all. -Oh, please... look who's talking. The flakiest flake in fucking Flake Town. -Oh, oh, Beth. We can't swear. There's children. -The farm is in the middle of nowhere. -Really? -Yeah, it is. Okay? -Hm. -I don't even know why Rose wanted to go there but she did. So I said, "Great. Okay, fine" and made it happen, but it's not exactly some fun little getaway. Can we not fight about every single thing, please? -Sure. -I mean, who cares? It's-- it's just a-- -I care. I don't like them. -You don't like anybody. You hate my friends and Rose's friends. You don't have any friends of your own, so no luck there. Who is it that you actually do like, Tess? Remind me. -I don't know. I think I used to like you, but that was a long time ago. -You can be such a bitch sometimes. -Thanks. Right, who's driving, you or me? Just remember, it's not a race, all right? Please don't lose them the first chance you get. -Oh, them? No. I promise. -That is bullshit. He's crazy. I never said that I would do that. No, I didn't. No, I did not. Okay, maybe I did. But not with him. -Do we want vodka, too or...? -Yeah. Duh. I mean, it's a party. Somebody's gonna want vodka. What? No, not you. I'm talking to Esther. My best friend Esther. -Who is that? -Can I just finish? No, no, no, that's Jasmine. My other best friend. No, this is Esther. No, you haven't met her. It's-- seriously, it doesn't matter. Sebastian, can I just please... Oh, my god. -Hi. Oh, my gosh. You guys look so great. Yay. What's up? Nothing. Just getting supplies. Just like you. Whoo. It's wine o'clock somewhere, am I right? Come on! It's a party. -Is it though? Have you seen where we're going? It's in the middle of nowhere and it's-- no offense, but it's a kind of a dump. -No, it's old. It's charming. Rose and I used to go there as kids like all the time. Almost every summer. -Yeah, but who has her bridal-whatever-thingy at a farm in the desert? I mean, come on. -Excuse me. It's not a bridal-whatever-thingy. It's a bachelorette party. There's a huge difference. -Yeah. Duh. What's the difference? -Ummm, no grandmas or little kids and shit. Okay, this is what Rose wants. Just us having fun and getting wasted. - Yeah. - Yes, yes. - Sorry. Cleanup on aisle four. -I see Mia hasn't changed much. - Yeah, pretty much. But she'll be fine. I mean, she's better when she's a little drunk. -Or high. -Or just been fucked. What? I never fucked her. Uhhh... -What? I didn't. I mean, not since school. -I knew it. I knew it. -What? -I knew it. -Ladies, snacks? Esther, come on. On chips. Whoa! -What's gonna go with mac and cheese? Hey, cutie. Need some help with that? -Yeah, you know, if you want a ride, our truck's right outside. -Come for a ride. -You know, thanks. We're good. -What about you, sweetheart? You looking for something special? -No, I'm-- I'm good. -I don't think we got one of them international aisles here, so. Oh, and then there were three. -You boys just taking a break from getting shit-faced or are you excited to look at someone other than your sister? -Well, there's no harm in looking now, is there, sweetheart? Hm? -Depends, I guess. -Yeah, well, we're not looking at you. So why don't you move on? -For sure. Hey, you should take that cap off if you didn't serve. And I know you didn't. -I did. I served. I gave it to him. -No way. Where'd you serve? -Ramstein. 86th Airlift Wing. -Oh, I thought you said you "served." My mistake. -Fuck you. I bet you don't even know where that is. -Not exactly, but I-- I think it's in southwestern Germany, right? About 15 clicks east of K-Town and three clicks west of Landstuhl? Oh, I know why you look familiar now. Are you one of the guys who changed my bedpan when I got medevacked there? I almost missed it. -Bullshit. -Bullshit? -I was an MP, for your info, all right? That's Military Police. -Wow. -Where you medevacked from? -Fallujah. That's, uh, that's in Iraq, for you boys. -Nah. No fucking way, you're too young. -No. Third battle. 2016. -No, because we didn't have any troops in that, bitch. -No, we had advisors from 2014 on. Who do you think was protecting them, asshole? People like me, who were in the actual shit. Not people like you, who were skipping around Europe enjoying Oktoberfest. -You better watch your fucking mouth. -You're probably right. -You think you're tough, huh? -I mean, I'm tough enough, I guess. -Yeah. Why don't we find out how tough? -Tess? -You know, I would love to. I just... I gotta get to a party. So maybe another time. We'll see you there. Okay, great. I'm surprised they even had wine. Hey, do we even know who the caretakers are anymore? I don't. -Me either, but I called and left a message like we're supposed to when we use the house. -I thought it was an older couple. A man and a woman. No, that was... is it? Dad keeps losing people so I'm not even sure. I think these guys have been here for a while now. I'll walk down later and introduce myself. -Or I can. I know you want to get started with the party. -Either way. Maybe better if it's me since I'm the one who contacted them for the party and everything. Uh-uh. -I love it here. Great vibes. I told you so. Yes, you did. -Look at that. -I'm looking. I bet you are. Mm-hm. Or you don't have to wear a push-up bra. That's why I got. There's only 150 since. -Oh. -Come on, bitch. Let's have some fun. -Oh, this is me having fun. -Oh. - Sorry. I'm just daydreaming for whatever reason. -Oh, it's okay. Hey, it's... it's really good to see you. -You too. -Okay, who wants me to do a reading? Oh, me! Aahh. Come on. Let's pull a card. No. No, thank you. Sorry, no, thank you. -Hey, Tessie. Who's your favorite sister? Come on, say it. Hey. -You are. Hey, middle sis. -Hi, little sis. -Thanks for coming. I know this isn't your kind of thing, so thank you. Honestly. -Of course. -Hey, Tess. You still out there making America great again? -Maybe. You still out there letting third graders do your hair? -Braids are very in right now. -I mean... -I like these. -Bitch. -How's life? -All good. Working, partying. -This is gonna be fun, right? -Oh, yeah. Yes, of course. -Okay. -Look at you. Bride-to-be. Could you be cuter? Look at your body. -Ugh, no. Look at you! You're fit as shit. Seriously, Tess. -Well, yeah. -What the hell? -One addiction for another. -Come here, you fucking cutie. - Beth! - You fucking cutie! -Hello! -Hello? -No. Seriously, let's get it done tonight. It's what we said we'd do. It makes me nervous if we don't... got too many guys we've been using lately, too many big mouths, plus, we got those new people moving in come Monday. Let's get it out of there tonight or move it at least. -Fine. -Shit. I gotta run back into town, grab some trash bags. You wanna come with? -Uh, yeah. Start the truck. I gotta take a piss. -All right. -Who's this? Oh. Yes. Sorry about that. Yeah. Hello? Hello? Yeah, I hear you. Sorry, the reception is bad here. No, we got your message about you and the party. Is everything okay? That's great. Your sister? No. Nobody has been down here today. Not that I know of. Uh, if I see her, I will. I'm just heading into town. You-- you ladies need anything? No? All right, have fun. You too. Take care. "Take care." Shut the fuck up. All right. Oh, my god. -Have you given a hand job to someone who you were not very attracted to? Why would I? No. -Who are you? -I'm sorry? -Who are you? -I'm the chef... for tonight. -A chef? Yeah. Okay. That's fine, I guess. -You guess? Oh, my god. - You are a funny one. -You have no idea. -Tess. - Hey. -Where you been? -In here, giving me the third degree. -That's not true. I was asking him who he was. I didn't see him when I went outside and then I come in and there's these knives everywhere and... yeah. -Can I talk to you for a second? -Please. -Okay, I'm on my way. I'll just prepare in here. - Shot! Oh, my god. What, um,. What-- what do you think you're doing? -What does that mean? -I come into the kitchen to check on the chef, and of course, I find you in here in conflict with him, like with every other man walking the face of the fucking planet. And because why? -I'm sorry. I... I came in here and-- and I didn't know who he was and so I asked. That's it. He wasn't here when I left, all right? -Right. Yeah, yeah. Uh, left to go where? -You know where. -I said I would take care of it. But no, you had to go down there, didn't you? -So what? -Because I said I'd take care of it. -And? -And? And guess what? Everything is fine. -No. There's something strange about those guys. -Oh, oh, really? Really? What's... what's strange? -Well, I went in, um, and, uh-- -Sorry. You went-- you went in-- in their house? -Not their house. It's our house. Our property. Still. But I'm sorry. I had to. They're suspicious. -Says who? - Says me. - Okay. So, um, I called home and they're the guys who were hired last year to help with the handover of the property, okay? So not murderers. -Wait, you spoke to Dad? -Mm-hm. -How did you call him? There's no landline here. It isn't working. I checked. -You are fucking insane, do you know that? I leaned out the window in the upper bedroom like we always used to do. -Right. -Listen to me. Just listen. Please listen to me. Seriously. Your sister, our sister, is trying to have her bachelorette party and this is what you want to do? Try and-- try and scare people? I'm sorry. But maybe you should relax and... have a drink. Maybe that'd help. -I'm sorry, what? -You heard me. A little bit of alcohol. -That's a real shit thing to say to me, you know that? Just, uh... just call 'em like I see 'em. Thanks for dressing up, by the way. It's really nice. There she is! Okay, okay, okay. Have you joined the Mile High Club? Oh, she has. Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh. Okay. -Have you ever had sex on a carnival ride? Oh, my gosh. Duh. Have you hooked up with an unattractive rich guy? -Um, yes! -Fuck it. Yeah, not today. Not today. Shot! Shot! Shot! Shot! Shot! Shot! Shot! -Ladies. - Oohh! -Hello, hello, hello. My name is Alfonse and I've got some treats for you ladies to get you guys started. Oh, my god. They're tiny little dicks! Yes, they are. Yes, they are dicks. Yes, they are. Thank you. I think you should have two dicks. -I'll have two dicks in my mouth. -Two dicks in her mouth. Now, I'm not sure how much you ladies know about this evening but we are going to have a great time. I promise you that. I've got some beautiful sea bass croquettes along with a few other treats and that's not even talking about dessert. You know what I mean? -I hope you're dessert. -Oh my, my, my. Aren't you the naughty little girl? -Fuck yes, I am! Yeah, she is. -As luck would have it, I'm a naughty little boy. So things might get a little interesting. Oh, my god! Whoa! -Hey, middle sis. -Hey. My baby girl. -What's going on? -Hey, I'm sorry. I'm not trying to ruin anything for you. -Oh, no, no. It's fine. -I just need a little space. -You're just missing the stripper, that's all. -The what? -The stripper. -Oh shit. The caterer guy? Oh, god. -Exactly. He is also the entertainment. - So gross. - Yeah. I was very happy to get out of there and let the others take a turn. -Good girl. -So... what's happening out here? -Nothing. I just... just feels weird being back here, that's all. -You sure? -Yeah, why? -Do you want to talk about it? -No. It's your night. Oh, boy. -Rose, I'm sorry about this. Sorry, Rose, that I even let you invite her. It's cold out. Come back inside. You don't have to comfort her. It's not your job. -We're just talking, Beth. -Yeah. Yeah, like sisters do. -Do you mind if your fucking sister goes inside and enjoys the rest of her fucking party that I put together for her? Or do you want to keep making this all about you? Huh? Rose? Open the door. -Beth, open the door! Beth, go! What's going on? What's happening? - Oh, my god. Wait, what's happening? -Beth, close the door. Beth. Oh, my god, Rose. Is that blood? -Tess, what the fuck is going on? Who the fuck is out there? - Oh, my god, Rose. - Beth. Beth, Beth. I need you to get your phone. Beth, look at me. I need you to call 911 or Dad. Whoever you can get a hold of, okay? Beth, look at me. Go now. I'll go. I'll go. I know the trick. Out the window, right? -Yeah, yeah. -Rose and I used to do that and I-- -Go, go, go, go. Be careful. - Tess, what happened? - What is happening, Tess? -Okay, okay, okay. Ladies, don't be afraid. This is what we are going to do. Tess, what's happening? What are we doing? - Tess! What the fuck! -Shut up. What the fuck. Oh, shit. Okay. -Oh, shit. Okay. All right. We got to get the rest of these doors locked, okay? Pull some shit up against them. Make sure they're blocked. All these lights have to go out. Unplug every single thing you see upstairs and down. If they get in here, it needs to be pitch dark, okay? Stay low. You guys start in here. I'm gonna get the kitchen. -Esther's upstairs trying to call out. But I need all of you to do the same. Grab your phones. Call the police. Call 911. Call anyone you can get ahold of, all right? Do it now. Who is it? Why are they doing this? -I don't know. Not yet. I-- I-- is it someone's boyfriend? O-- o-- or? Hey, what's going on? -I don't know. Stop asking me. -I'm sorry, but they're trying to fucking kill us. So that's why I'm asking. -Screaming is not going to keep us alive. Listen to me, and maybe that will. Now get on your goddamn phone. -I've got nothing, no signal. It's not working. No signal. - Me neither. Shit, shit, shit. -All right, we need to get prepared for whatever those people are going to do next. In fact, you guys, we gotta start gathering weapons. - What? - All right? - Weapons? - Yes. Anything that can hurt or kill someone. Just anything, okay? Knives in the kitchen. Scissors in the drawer or the fireplace poker. -This is a farm. You don't have a gun or something like that? -My mom hates 'em. We don't keep them in the house. - What the fuck. -My dad has a bunch of shit in the shed but it's out by the orchard. His guns are in there too. But I'd have to... I'd have to go get it. First things first. We get ready to fight in here. -It's okay. It's okay. They're just trying to scare us. -Yeah? It's working. -I know, but... I think they're trying not to draw attention to themselves, trying not to alert the neighbors. That's why they're using bows and arrows and not guns. -It's got to be a mistake, right? I mean, why else would they be doing this? -I don't know. I honestly don't know. Shit. -Let me check the cars. We can't just sit around doing nothing. -Who's out there? -I need one of you to run upstairs and warn Esther. She's at the back of the house. She's not going to know what's happening before it's too late. And what are you going to do? -Someone out there is slashing our tires so we don't leave. I'm going to try and stop 'em. What? How? -How do you think? Divya, I need you to open the back door for me, okay, and then close it behind me. Lock it. If I make it back, I'm gonna knock twice, and then once. Don't open it unless you hear that. Two knocks followed by one. -Are you fucking kidding me? -No, I'm not. Let's go. -But if you don't come back, then what do we do? -All of you do anything to survive, and I mean anything. -Tess, this is insane. -I know. Let's go. All right, come on. -Hey. -What happened out there? -I got one of them. Dead. Mia's car is still okay. -Look at your hands. It's fine. No, it's not. -You're bleeding. -No, it's not mine. We don't have time to think about this. They're gonna come after us when they find out what's happened. I didn't see anyone else out there but, I know they're wandering around trying to figure out what to do next... Oh, these are great. Thank you, guys. -Got it. -Each of you, you need to grab one thing from this pile. Be ready to use it. See if you recognize this guy. I don't. -No. -Take a look. -Jackass. -No? All right, I'm gonna go upstairs to try to help Esther. Two of you, keep your eyes on the kitchen. We're gonna get out of here but we have to do this together. Okay? - Tess, I'm scared. -Me, too. I just... I just want to see my little girl, and that's all I want, okay? To be with my family again. -You will. And... -Hey. I'm sorry that we're always at each other's throats. I know it has a lot more to do with me than it does with you. -I appreciate you saying that. Even if it isn't true. -I'll be back. -Okay. -Any luck? Oh, fuck. Esther! Come here. I need to-- oh, shit. Damn it. -What happened up there? -Esther, she was... -What? -She leaned out too far and... I couldn't-- I'm sorry, Mia. I'm s... I'm so sorry. -She was trying to save us. Oh, my god. They're gonna come in here and kill us. I know it. -Stop it, okay? We're safe in here for now. Stop saying that. -That's not true. There are people out there. They killed three of us already with arrows. So how can you say that? -I'm saying it because I believe it. I'm saying it to all of you because I believe it. -Yeah. Well, Esther believed you too. When you told her to go up there and make a phone call? Maybe you should have done it yourself if it was so dangerous. -Divya. That is not fair. -I don't care. I'm not being fair right now. I'm calling Tess out on her decisions so far, that's what I'm doing. -That's fine. Yeah. Fuck it. I'm gonna sit right here and you're going to tell us what to do, Divya, since you have such a big fucking mouth. You're going to come up with a plan for our survival. Evening, ladies. How's your party going? -We've called the police. They're on their way right now. Bullshit. There's no signal out here. We're in the middle of fucking nowhere. And if you had called, your friend wouldn't have been hanging out the window back there trying to get a few bars. I tell you what; let's get this shit over with... Because if you don't do that, try and do something smart, like, get away, I'm gonna set my guys loose on you. And you're not gonna like that. Not one bit. I promise you won't. And after all, that fucking and killing, we're still just gonna get what we came for. So why don't you make it easier on everybody and come outside? If you do that... right now, and this is the only chance I'm ever going to give you, I will let you go. You got my word on it. Open up that front door and walk right out. Leave your car. Run down the road to safety. Right now. You got no idea who we are and all we want is what's inside that house. -What is it? What's inside the house? -What is he talking about? -What is it they think is here. -I have no idea. -Please, Beth, you got to tell us. -That-- there's-- there's nothing here. -Please. -She said she doesn't know. He is a liar. -Tess, honestly. What's in here? -Nothing I know off. -Oh, come on. Even criminals don't just attack for no reason. -Yes, they do. All the time. You know what I mean? He said he wants what's inside the house. Why would they say there's something here? Why would they go through all this if there wasn't anything to gain? -To draw us out, to get-- get us out of the house? I don't know. The only thing I know is there isn't anything of value in here. He's tricking us. -He sounds serious to me. What the fuck is taking so long? -I don't know what's happening here? Why you think we have anything of value? But we don't. This is our parent's place and they don't have a safe or antiques or anything like that. And if somebody told you they do, they were lying to you, okay? So please, please, please just leave. Please leave! Not what we heard. Why don't you open up that front door? Let us come inside and take a look around. If that's true, we'll walk away. And you all make it through the night. It's up to you now. But this is my last offer... before bad things start to happen. And I mean really bad fucking things. -I know who that is. I know that voice. -Who? The guy from the store today. I had words with him. He must have gotten his friends and-- and followed us or something. -Yeah. The one who was talking to us. -Someone you just met, huh? What happened at the store? What exactly did he say? -What did you do to them? -Nothing. They were just being dicks and I got into it with them. Then tell them you're sorry. If it's true, and that's why they're here, just tell them you didn't mean it. -No. No, it can't be. -He said we could leave. He said it. -No. Everything he says is a lie. - Tess. - Oh, my fucking God. Listen to this bitch. She's gonna get us killed. I'm serious. -Well, I'm not gonna open this door and let them walk in and hope that nothing bad happens. -You really want to play that game with these animals? He said he would kill us. -I know what he fucking said. -Well, you are the soldier person. So why don't you save us? I would if I could. Go on war hero. Do something. -Bridget, stop. Don't be an idiot. -What? Fuck both of you! -Stop being an asshole, Bridget! - God. All right, ladies. Time's up. You've made your choice. I don't care how long it takes. We're gonna pick you off one by one, and we're gonna fucking enjoy it. -Shit. -Get to the middle. Get in closer. Come on. -Billy is dead. -What? -I thought we hadn't heard from him for a while, and then Cody found him over by their fucking cars... They stabbed him. -Fuck. -They stabbed him. Okay, okay. You know who it was, right? It was that fucking army bitch. Okay, that's how she wants to play? that's how we'll play. -Dude, are you sure about this? -Dead sure. -They fucking killed him, man. He's dead. All right? Dead. -I know. I heard you. And now they're gonna pay for it. I promise. -Can't we just bust in there... -No. -And get the fuck-- ? Come on. -No, no, no. At first I just wanted to spook 'em. I just wanted to scare 'em a little bit and make 'em sweat. Now I want to toy with them. Now I want to have a little fun because that's what they deserve. -Okay. Okay. It just seems... -What? I planned this for six months. We already started, and we're not stopping now. I'm not gonna let some shitbags ruin it for us. -It's just, it's getting kinda a little bit more than we bargained for here. -Listen to me. You heard what those guys said, right? This place has been sold. They were packing up and moving on. The time is now. This is it. Guys like us are never gonna have another shot at money like this. Not ever. And I want it. I want what they got in there. I want what they got in the house, and I want to kill that bitch as well. I'm gonna find her, and I'm gonna stick my knife right through her fucking skull. -Shit. What the fuck are they doing? Why are they just sitting out there? -Look, I'm sorry about Rose, you know? I'm just... fucking scared. -I understand. I have to be honest with you, guys. If they get in here, we don't really have a chance. So we have to do something drastic and we need to do it now. We need to do something that they don't expect. What if we all just took off running across the fields in a bunch of different directions? -They have weapons and trucks. -Still. Three or four of us could make it. -Okay, how you guys feeling about that? A mass run out the door, see what happens? -Guys, it's better than getting killed in here or worse. Tortured, raped. You know? Guys, come on. -I don't think I'd make it 50 yards. -Yeah, me neither. Look at my shoes. I'm gonna get far barefoot? - Same. - Fine. It was just an idea. -It's not a bad idea, Divya. It just won't work. But something like it might. Something more strategic. We need to attack. We need to bring the fight to them or at least be prepared to fight if they get in here, and they will get in here; it's only a matter of time. If a couple of us take off running, we could have a chance. -Then what? Leave the rest of us behind? -No, no. Just like I did before, but to arm ourselves. I have to get to the toolshed, Beth. -Let's all go there, then, and lock ourselves in. -No, we wouldn't make it. Not all of us. -Fucking hell. I'm just being honest. We wouldn't all make it but I could make it. I could get there, grab some ammo and some rifles, get back here so that we possibly have a chance. That's-- that's the good news. My other idea is the caretaker's cottage, just down the hill. It still has a working landline. But the problem is the caretakers. We don't know if they're in on this or-- or if they'll be there. Or what? I mean, we have no idea. But one of you needs to race out there, draw some attention to yourself, break in, call 911, and then take off and never look back. -You mean, that person will get away? I mean, after they make the call or whatever? -Maybe. Means a lot of "maybes." A lot of things have to happen for them to get away. But there's a chance, yes. -It's not a terrible plan. -But I have to tell you, I will be using you as bait. I want them to chase you. It's not a suicide mission exactly, but it's not great. Hey, get over here. Hey. -If we're gonna do anything, we need to do it now. Anyone? -I'll do it. -What? Mia, no. That is insane. -Anybody else run track in school? I didn't think so. But I did. I ran track and I was fast. I was really fast. So... it makes sense that it's me. And if I make it, then I will see you ladies at Denny's tomorrow morning for breakfast. And if I don't, then... -You can have my car keys, if you can use them. Does anybody have a hair tie? -Yeah, I do. You need to go out the kitchen door. Okay? Make some noise. I want them to see you. - Okay. - Run as fast as you can. Get to the house, call 911. I'll do the rest. -Okay. Um... Um... Beth, can you hand me those sneakers? I don't think he's going to use them anymore. -Ten seconds after she runs out of that door, I will follow her. -God, you really were in the army, weren't you? -I was. For a long time. Remember, it's two knocks and then one. If anything else they get in here, you run, you fight to the death, whatever you have to do to stay alive. I will find a way back inside to get you. Okay? Okay. -I'll see you bitches at brunch tomorrow. -Let's do this. -Come on. Let's go. -Thank you. You're really fucking cool. -Thanks. Hey, um, full disclosure. I always wanted to ask you out. I never had the guts to do it. Just so you know. Yeah, big crush, all this time. Okay. -Good luck. -Thanks. Hey! Assholes! Go fuck yourselves. -You got this. -Where's it? Where is the phone? Where's the fucking phone. Come on. Come on. Come on. No! No, what? -No, no. No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no, no. -Was that it? Is that...? Is that Tess? -It can't be. -That's Tess. -She said she would come in through the back door. -No. -It's the front door. Why does she need to get in? Why does she need to get in? She said, two, then one. -It was two and one. That was two and one, right? We can't leave her out there. - Divya, just wait. We cannot leave her out there. Come on. - Divya, just wait. Just wait. Divya. But what if it's her? What if it's her? - Tess? Tess, is that you? Seriously, is that you, or? Oh, god! Oh,god! Spread out. Find them. They're here somewhere. So find them. No, no! Help me! Help me! Aaaahh! Oh, shit. Shit. -Tell me what the fuck is going on! -I can't. I can't. -Talk to me! -Can you untie me, please? Please untie me so-- -Why are they after us? Why? -I-- I don't know. -Bullshit. Tell me. Now! -Okay. Okay. Because we... we-- we told 'em about... -What? You told them what? -About the money! The money. -What are you talking about? -Please untie me so I... -You'll tell me what the fuck is going on or I'm gonna leave you here to die. Okay, okay. Okay, okay. These local guys, we used to push products sometimes. They-- they found out about the cash that we've been storing in the house and they broke in here and they said they were gonna kill us, so... we told them about you guys at the house. We-- we told them that you're with us. That you were our girlfriends. -What? -We were just trying to stay alive, that's all. I-- I swear. -Oh, shit. I'm gonna cut you out. and you're gonna help me, do you understand? -Yeah, okay. -Where are my father's guns? Where are the guns? -Fuck this. -You fucking killed Billy. You should have run when you coulda. -I don't do that. The fuck? Well, well, well, look what we got here. Little girl gang. Potato peeler? really? Look at these little bitches. Scared shitless. Where is she? You know who I'm talking about. You remember me? Any of you? Y'all too busy buying Haagen-Daz and shit today? -I've... I've never seen you before. -No? You didn't stop in town at the little store they got there? -No. We just... we came straight here. For the party. Right, right. Well, too bad for you then. -I remember you. -Good. I've shown you my face. -You understand what that means? It means none of you are leaving here alive. Unless we come to a deal. You got that? Right now. We come to an agreement, and you stick to it and so will I. -What do you want? -Hm. That's funny. You must be the funny one. I like that. Can you believe these chicks are drug dealers? I mean, it's a bit of a stretch, but. What? Drug dealers? What are you talking about? That is so... We came here for a bachelorette party and you attacked us. Please just... -And I'm sure you know nothing about the cash they got up in the attic either, huh? -There's no cash. There's no cash. -Where's the army cunt? Where is she? I will fucking kill you right now if you don't tell me. -She's outside. She ran out to try and make a call or-- or help or get guns or something, anything she could do to help us. I-- I am telling the truth. She's outside, I-- I promise. -Hear from Cody about the other one? -Uh-uh. -How about Dick? -Mm-mm. -Look, maybe there is money here or whatever, okay? But we don't know anything about that. We are just guests. Maybe Tess is mixed up in all of this. I don't know. I mean, I wouldn't put it past her. She's been really fucked up since she came back from the war. But that is not us. That has nothing to do with us. -Shh. Bridget, stop it. Stop talk-- stop telling them shit. -You really gonna listen to Black chick tell you what to do? Come on. Be your own woman. All right, You done helpin' me out? -I guess she is. -Mother fucker! -Oh, shut the fuck up. You two, asses on the couch if you want to live. Right now. I'm going to the attic to check it out. If I find the cash, I'll let you know. We'll start hauling it down. -Hey. You think maybe we should get the fuck out of here? We already got all the stuff from the shed, ain't that enough? It's a lot of meth. I'm just sayin'. -If it was, we'd be gone already. You understand that? This is money. Cash money I want it all. I want the money, I want the girl, so shut your mouth and do what I say. That chick's coming back here, and when she does we need to be ready. So you find her, you bring her to me. Till then watch them. Kill them if they so much as sneeze. -Can we fuck 'em? -When we're done, yeah. -Not until we get what we came for. Got it? -Got it. -When it's time, which one you want? -I don't care. Either one. The black one, I guess. -Oh, look at you. Fucking dark horse is what you are. Hey. You want to fuck me? -What are you doing? Stop. -Go ahead and do it. I won't scream or anything... if you let us go after. - Shut up. - No. Let her talk. You'd do what? Say it again. -Fuck you... or suck your cock. -Oh, you little piece of shit. You would, wouldn't you? -Of course I would. I want to live. So... please... let me do that. -He said to wait. -Fuck it. I'm not gonna stop her if she wants to put my dick in her mouth so badly. You go ahead. -Okay. Then you let us go. -Let's see how you do first. -Agh! -How many more? -Just one. Upstairs. -Gun? -I didn't see any. -You do what you want to that one and then you run and don't look back. -We'll take care of this one. Don't you worry. -Oh, come on. Oh, I want it all. Oh, come on. -No rush. You're the last one left. Wow. That is a lot of money. -Yeah. You're one tough little shit, aren't you? -I am. -Which one was your boyfriend? Not that it matters, they're both dead, but still... you were really fucking slumming it, weren't you? Must make you a nasty little junkie. -You still don't get it. It was just a party. -Oh, fuck. My bad. Just wrong place, wrong time for you girls, huh? -I guess so. -Just turn around and walk away. You do that right now, and I won't follow you. I promise. -I can't do that. I'm gonna kill you. - Holy shit. I'm giving you an out now, so take it. -I don't want it. -Motherfucker. -We don't need to do this shit anymore, all right? So let's come to an understanding or something. Wow. Silent treatment, huh? -Why do women gotta be so fucking difficult? Let's go. -You fucked with the wrong girls. -Oh, fuck it. -So... why don't you tell us again... what happened? Real slow, so we can all follow along. -I'm sorry, that sounds like an order. I thought this was an interview that I granted you. -Please. -Okay. Which part? -The attack part. The attack on all you girls at your daddy's house. -It's my parents' house. My father and my mother own it. -Mind if we record this? -I didn't think it was that kind of a meeting, Frank. -It's not Bev. Just asking. Then I'd prefer you didn't. -Fine. -Now, you said before that you tried to keep these men out of the house by blocking the windows and locking all the doors, that kind of thing? -Yes. -But that at some point they overpowered you, and they took you all hostage inside the main property. Inside. -Correct. -I believe she already covered that in her initial statement. Well, that's good. That's good, because now she won't have any trouble reviewing it again a second time, will you? -No, I don't. But I do have a problem with your tone, Sheriff. I'm not the guilty party here. None of us are. We are the victims. And if nothing else, we'd like your sympathy. -You're telling me that these guys came in there, took over, killed a whole bunch of you ladies, and then once they got what they wanted, turned on each other and started killing themselves instead. Meanwhile, outside, up at that tool shed you got on the property, out on the lawn, up in the attic, a fucking bloodbath. And then, at some point, at some point, the three of you overpowered two of these boys, and then you killed them in self-defense with fucking potato peelers and garden shears and shit like that. And then, you escaped on foot, undetected by anyone, and made it all the way back into town. Is that what I'm supposed to believe? -That's right. -Well, I don't. I just do not. -Well, I'm sorry. That is what happened. -Horseshit, young lady. Horseshit. -I'm sorry, is that a question? -You know exactly what that is. -I see. Is there anything further you need from her at this point? -No, I guess not. I mean, I got a shitload of questions. But I think I'll save 'em for another time and all those lawsuits I know will start coming down your way. I will tell you this though... I hope I never see you or any of those girls up in these parts, not ever again. You understand what I'm saying? -Yes, that's very clear. And just to be more clear, you're telling me that you and your sisters had no idea what was going on out there with those caretakers and their meth lab and all that. That you just happened to come up there that night for your little party, and all this shit came down by some very strange and almost impossible goddamn coincidence? -Yeah... Just wrong place, wrong time, I guess. What'd they ask you about--? -You okay? -No, but I will be. -Let's go.
