It was a dark and stormy night out on the open sea. The legendary ship, The Shiny Cutlass, was still in trouble. Admiral Boggs was worried. With a tangled topsail the ship was bound to run aground. The crew's only hope was... Captain Trumpet-Tooter! Nicely done, Trumpet-Tooter! Ahoy! Pirates! Using his trusty spyglass, Trumpet Tooter spotted the pirate ship. If he didn't act fast, it would surely catch them. Whoa! Our map! What shall we do now? Trumpet-Tooter didn't need a map. A sailor goes where the wind takes him. But what if the wind takes us straight into that? Everything's getting wet. George! Too much splashing. Look, I-- I know how excited you get by these Trumpet-Tooter books, but now it's bedtime. The whale can wait. We need a good night's sleep, because tomorrow is our vacation to Coddington. Got a second, George? These are my souvenirs from when I went to Coddington as a kid. Oh. It was my favorite vacation ever. And I now want it to be yours's too. Ah! My napkin from the Codfather restaurant. Oh, best spaghetti and codballs you'll ever have. Whoa! Cod light from the Coddington Museum. Pretty neat, huh? And best of all... Cod Fest. The day when the whole town becomes a carnival. There are rides, games, balloons. Oh, and not only did I put our whole schedule on this handy-dandy card... I programmed it into my watch. I'm setting the first alarm for dawn. We'll get there early and spend the day at the beach. Okay, one more chapter, just to help you sleep. "The whale was headed straight for Trumpet-Tooter. But he knew... just... what to do..." Aah! George! We slept through our alarm. We are behind schedule. Uh. Flip-flops! Uh, beach toys. Floaties! George, the floatie doesn't need to be inflated yet. It's not going to fit. George! Aah. * Racing along don't ever care * * Sun in your face wind in your hair * * Humming a song and feeling so fine * * What could go wrong * * In the sweet sweet summertime * * Everything's cool everything's fine * * Don't need a nickel to have a good time * * The days are bright * * As a shining new dime * * It's all going right * * In the sweet sweet summertime * * Curious delirious * * There's just no way you can be serious * * It's such a great sensation * * We're going on vacation * * No need for worries * * No frowns or frets * * Wherever you are is as good as it gets * * Like a balloon * * That's starting to climb * * Happy today * * In the sweet sweet summertime * * No clouds in sight * * No sigh of rain * * When things are so right, no need to complain * * Me and my pal * * Rocking the rhythm in life * * Everything's great in the sweet summertime * * Anticipating that sweet sweet * * Sweet summertime * * What time is it? * * Sweet summertime * * What time is it? ** Hey, look. We finally made it, George. The Comfy Cod Bed and Breakfast. * Up and up * * And down down down down down down down down * * And back up again * * Up and up and up and up * * And the ship sank down * * Diddly-down down down down down * * And down down and up and up and up * Uh, uh. Hello? Uh, uh. Ahoy! I'm Captain Elmer. Come in, come in. Ooh. Oh, here. I made you a welcome snack platter. Uh, mini-marshmallows with cheese balls? Also a great bait for fish. Hm. I'm sorta new at this Bed and Breakfast stuff. I'm usually a fisherman. Fisherman. Never would have guessed. Ooh, that's a hook remover. Yeah, yeah. Found it with my trusty metal detector. Along with all these little treasures. And there's more where that came from. The ocean's full of treasures, mysteries, and adventures. Ever work one of those before? I knew straight-off you were a sea monkey. Uh-uh. Now let's see how you cast. This monkey's a natural. Now reel it in. Uh, take in the slack. You hooked something. Maybe it's a flounder. Or a... My niece Emma? Hello, Hello. Oh, sorry. You must be the new guests. Ted... and George. I thought I'd make your guests some healthy welcome smoothies. Uh. A nice fried codfish is what they're wanting. Can't stop dreaming about cod, can you, uncle? You can take it from here, uncle. Well, bye for now. Oh! Time to check the schedule. Bedtime. Oh, guess he runs a tight ship, huh? Well, your bedroom is just this way. Oh, hey look! You can see the lighthouse from here. Ow! Hm. Yup. Looks like we missed everything on today's list. But we'll find a way to squeeze it all in tomorrow. See you in the morning, George. Huh. I wonder who that is with Captain Elmer. She looks familiar. Uh, no, no, let me show you just one more, Gertrude. I-- I found it last Tuesday. Ta-da! Looks historical, doesn't it? Good enough for the museum? Not even close. Good day, Elmer. Ahoy! Oh, hey, captain, who was that? Gertrude St. John. Head of the Coddington Museum. The museum? George, we're going there this afternoon. Oh, I hope it hasn't changed too much since I was a kid. What? Changed? I don't know if it's even been dusted. But hey, how about a tour of Coddington Bay in the Happy Clam? Huh? What do you say, George? Would you like to be my first mate? Oh, uh, boat trip is scheduled for tomorrow. We're actually supposed to be building sand castles now. Oh. Well, I guess if we move this here, and this here... we can squeeze in a quick boat tour. Oh, that's herring. All fish love it. Seals too! Well, I think the engine's in order, so... Stand at the ready, helmsman! Oh! I coulda sworn I'd fixed this thing. - No. - It's okay, George. We're still on time for sand castles. Permission to go ashore granted! Oh, but, George, if you're gonna be my first mate, you'll be needing this. An official Bosun's whistle. Oh. Well, keep practicing and you'll get it plenty loud. Ah. It gets louder? I did not get enough sleep last night. Okay, let's get started on that sand castle. * Take a good look * * At this extraordinary day * * So many new things to do * * Wonders and mysteries are swimming your away * * To open up your eyes for you * * And all of a sudden there's a brand new sea * * Shining under the sun * * Something that you've never ever seen * * Looks like a whole lot of fun * * And it makes you wanna bounce * * Like big bunch of bubbles * * Flap your flippers and fin * * Down down down * * Go your troubles * * As a brand new adventure begins * * Just like wave on the ocean * * Laughs when it meets the sand * * You might need a newfangled notion * * You might find * * A newfangled friend * * Just by keeping your eyes wide open * * You might win the prize in the end * * You'll find a new kind of treasure * * When you find * * Your newfangled friend * * You might find * * A newfangled friend ** Yikes. George? Ah! George! It's time to go to the museum. George, if we don't stick to the schedule, we'll miss out on everything. I don't remember Coddington being so quiet. Oh! They must all be out getting ready for Codfest. Well, hello there! Name any animal, and Rocco, balloon-artiste, shall make it. Okay, if it's quick. A seal! Coming right up! Dadgummit! Oh, it's my trusty fish-hook hat. I used to be a fisherman, but you know with the cod being... Dadgummit! Okay, hold on. This for the tail, twist that, two flippers, and, here you go, one seal! That's a seal? I'm still in training. Oh, hello! I'm Gwen! "Trumpet-Tooter Meets the Crumpet-Looter." Yours for a dollar. Okay. Here you go. Hey! A pop-up Cod Cookbook. Made it myself! Wow! I bet you'll sell a hundred of those at Cod Fest. Come on, George, the museum awaits. Ah, Codfest. If only. Here we are, George, The Coddington Museum! Plenty of fish for chowdah there, Sam. Really! You say you were here as a child? Ah, yes. Ted. The boy who ruined the Humpback Whale exhibit. Just had to climb over the barrier to see what blubber feels like. You can still see your handprint. Gee... I forgot all about that. Is that what I think it is? Are you a Trumpet-Tooter fan? "A sailor goes where the wind takes him!" "Never mind the gale! Climb the mizzenmast and find us land!" Oh, my! What tales! In fact... Did you know that Trumpet Tooter's ship was once spotted in Coddington Bay? You mean Trumpet-Tooter is real? He is! And so is his ship. The Shiny Cutlass! Legend has it that pirates stole the Shiny Cutlass and then strayed off course to Coddington... They say a whale startled one of the thieving pirates and it caused him to drop Trumpet-Tooter's spyglass, somewhere in the Bay. Has anyone tried to look for it? The story's probably just a legend. But it's fun to think of Trumpet Tooter's famous ship right here in Coddington. It had an extraordinary figurehead! A Hippocampus. Half-horse, half-fish. Trumpet-Tooter had it on all his belongings. Nice shell. Hm-hmm. Do you still sell those codfish snow globes in the gift shop? Right this way. Hey, have you thought of updating some of your exhibits? Think I'm stuck in my ways, do you? The Atlantic Cod! Growing up to 200 pounds. That's a lot of fish sticks. Your monkey is in the cod school. In the what? The sign clearly states "No Riding the Mechanical Cod." Oh, dear. Uh-oh! George? I don't blame you. Anybody raised by this one is bound to become a troublemaker. I'll of course pay for any cod and blubber damages. Follow me to my office where I will figure out the damages. Why don't you wait for me here, George. On second thought, how about I meet you back at the Comfy Cod, okay? Okay. Hm. Well, a whole day treasure-hunting and just a horseshoe to show for it. Oh. I guess Emma came back to make more healthy smoothies. Hmm. Hi, George. Hm? * And the smoothie went down * * Diddly down down * Mouthwash! Great Neptune's Knickers! Uh! Oh. Hey, George! Uh, did you bring this seal here, and make a fish-bait smoothie? What do you have there? Wow, the horses' heads do look similar. I found this washed up on the beach years ago. George, look. Could this be the lens cap for Trumpet Tooter's spyglass? If it is, then maybe the spyglass itself is still somewhere in the Bay! Yes, George, crazy amazing. I always dreamed of finding a truly amazing treasure out there. Where did you find this? Well, where did you find it? The lens cap was hanging from that? Well, that's a tracking device. It tells scientists where the seal goes. And I bet I know who put it there. Wow! Come on. We have to get to the COW! Cow? The COW is our nickname for the "Cape Ocean Wildlife Institute." I bet they glued the tracking device on the seal pup. Do we know that octopus? So you're an octopus and head scientist? Well, we're short staffed, which means I have a lot of shoes to fill. And tentacles. Uh, so, Emma, George found a seal with a tracking device, uh... Okay, uncle, uh, in a minute. Yes, you're right, it's lunchtime. He did. Every time I visit the seals, I ring the bell to call them over. So now the seals ring the bell when they want me. Shall we feed them? Just toss 'em into their mouths. * You might find * * A newfangled friend * * Well it makes you wanna bounce * * Like a bunch of bubbles * * Flap your flippers and fins * * Down down down go your troubles * * As a brand new adventure begins * * Just like a wave on the ocean * * Laughs when it meets the sand * * You might need a newfangled notion * * When you find * * Your newfangled friend ** Your little friend has a knack with seals. Oh, he sure does! And he found a seal pup. I think it's wearing one of your tracking devices. Wait, it was a seal pup? A young seal? Sure was! Gee. He's still alone? Okay, uncle. Let's see what this little guy's been up to. And see where's he's been. So maybe we can find that spyglass. Uh, spyglass? This line shows us where the seal pup has been. Huh? It looks like he's traveled all over the cape. That's terrible. It's gonna take us years to find Trumpet Tooter's spyglass. Okay, uncle. Enough about the spyglass. I think we need to find the seal pup. See? There's the seal pup now. Oh. Heading to Seal Rock. Oh, he's probably going to his mother. If I plug his location into the satellite network, then maybe we can see them both. Yup, there's Seal Rock. It's home to hundreds of seals. Let's zoom in even closer. We might be able to spot the pup. Good eye, George! And that must be the pup's mother. Well, looks like she might be tangled in some fishing line. I don't know how we can help, George. When people approach, the seals tend to panic and flee into the water. Some can even get hurt. Oh. Ah, it's time for the early bird dinner, George! Tell you what, George. I'll keep trying to think of a way to help the seals and if I do, I'll call you. Okay? George, you are in for a treat! A Cod burger from the one and only Codfather Restaurant! Or maybe we should get the codballs. Or the Codaroni and Cheese! Ah, heck, let's get it all! And here we are! I-- I don't understand. Closed! Yeah. People came to the Codfather for the cod, but the cod aren't biting like they used to. Well, they better start biting. Cod Fest is in two days! Oh, but surely you've heard. Cod Fest was canceled a month ago. Canceled! I'm afraid you can't have Cod Fest without cod. It's in the name. The cod's been overfished. So for now, no one's fishing. Hopefully, that'll bring the cod back. But-- but this is Coddington! I mean... without Cod Fest, why'd we even come here? For the balloons! Hmm. George, when the going gets tough, the tough get going... To another town. We'll leave in the morning. Oh, I'm so sorry. I thought you knew Cod Fest got the heave-ho. Don't worry... I-- I worked up a new schedule last night. Portotuna has a Tuna Carnival, and it's just five hours north. But-- but we're so close to finding Trumpet-Tooter's spyglass. George, I promised you a great vacation, and that's what we're gonna have! Ooh! I had high hopes for Coddington. But it's just not how I remembered it. Emma will make sure the seal pup and his mom are alright. She doesn't need our help. Hi! I need your help! So, are you ready for your trip? Yup, we're all packed, and we'll still make Portotuna by nightfall. Huh? No-- no, I mean your trip to Seal Rock on the Magellan. Trip to where on the what? Our research ship, The Magellan. Oooh! Argh. George, the pedal! Um, do I have time to change my clothes first? Sorry, Ted, we gotta go now. * When the sun's in your eyes and the wind's at your back * * And the salty spray is flyin' * * There's a smile on your face a skip in your step * * And you know there's no denying * * The sea is always changing * * She's ancient and she's new * * You're bold and brave as you sail each wave * * With your hale and hearty crew * * Hey ho the wind does blow * * It sets the seas in motion * * Nothing's fine as the briny brine * * And a day out on the ocean * * Sailing on the ocean * * The sky above is truly blue * * The sea below is too * * The fish's roof is the sailor's floor * * And so let's sing this song once more * * Hey ho the wind does blow * * And if you take the notion * * To spend some time on the briny brine * * You'll have fun on the ocean * * The mighty brine * * The ocean * Uh? George, are you okay? It's best if we keep those tanks secure. They hold compressed air. Air, George. For breathing underwater. It's okay, George. Nothing got broken. Look! We're almost to Seal Rock. Oh, wow. Remember I told you how the seals here panic when humans get too close? Uh-huh. Well, George is so good at entertaining seals that I thought we could reach the seal pup's mom without scaring the seals into the sea. But it's gonna take all three of us. What size are you? Uh, size? Sometimes I wonder why I bother to make a schedule at all. That's the spirit! Hmm... If only I knew where that Seal Pup was... he could help us find his mother. Ohh! I knew bringing you along was a good idea. George. Ahh. You keep the seals entertained. Ted and I will follow the pup to its mom. [whistling "Strauss' The Blue Danube Waltz"] That's one amazing monkey. You have no idea. Let's go. Follow the pup! This way. And try not to call attention to yourself. Yeah, how do I do that? Act like a seal! Flop! More flopping! Oh, hi there, momma. That fishing line's bothering you, isn't it? Don't worry, we'll get this off you. Uh, Emma? I think they like your herring smell. That's good. Keep them distracted. Yeah, but there's a lot of them. Okay. Come on! That tickles! Oh, stop! Oh! Oh! Careful. Stop! Stop! Whoo! [George chattering the tune of "The Blue Danube"] We'll keep her at the COW overnight to make sure she heals okay. But thanks to you two, she's going to be fine. Hey, watch your fish-tossing! Ahh. That'sa submersible. It's an underwater vehicle. I collect plant samples on the sea floor with it. Ahh. Uh, George, I don't think you should be in there Seatbelts! Bye! We'll track 'em, catch 'em and reel 'em back in... I hope. Woo-hoo! * My my oh wow * * Look at where you are right now * * A place you never thought you'd be * * Right in the middle of a mystery * Let's quickly fire up the sonar... This will only take a second. Uh. Don't panic. It's probably just like driving a submarine. I wish I knew how to drive a submarine. Ohh. * Hey there ho there * * Everywhere you go there * * You're moving fast and floating free * * Right in the middle of a mystery * - Sorry! - Ta-ta! Yes! Gotcha! Let's go get 'em! Hang on tight, guys. Here we come! * Everyday that dawns is an open door * What is that? * To a world that you never knew before * * Everywhere you turn * * There's something new to understand * * Nothing like your plan * * Ain't that grand? * Oh, dear, they're headed for the edge of the continental shelf. It's a mile drop straight down! We got this. * All the mysteries * * Full of curiosity * Oh, boy! * There's no better place to be * * Than right in the middle * We can't stop! * Smack-dab in the middle * Whoa! . * Way down in the middle * * Of a mystery * poof Oh, wow! I guess when the vehicle gets too deep, it triggers safety balloons. Hah! Who knew? Ooh. Wow! What? What? Oh, good. Bet you guys had an amazing adventure. You saw a horse? I know. A seahorse! Boy, you are reallyexcited to pack the car and get to Portotuna, huh? The museum? Oh, no George, Gertrude St. John will never let us back in there! Hmm. George! You gorgeous simian! Look at this! Captain Elmer? Well, since that spyglass hasn't turned up yet, I figured I just had to show Gertrude the lens cap. This certainly is Trumpet Tooter's lens cap. And I believe Trumpet-Tooter's spyglass is out there too. Oh, my God! George, you're not saying Trumpet Tooter's whole ship is out there, are you? Wait! You saw thisfigurehead? Uh-huh. Underwater? We, um, did have a little underwater adventure. Is it possible the ship actually sank here? Well, the legend only states that after the ship wandered into Coddington, it was never seen again, so... So the Shiny Cutlass could very well be at the bottom of our Bay! George, if you're right about this... Coddington will become a destination again. And thrive 'til the cod come back! Do you think you could take us to that same spot tomorrow? Wait... Tomorrow? But that would mean... I guess it means I don't need this schedule because "This sailor goes where the wind takes him!" Let's go find a ship! Oh, yeah. Of course... Let's head out! Wow. What are all these people doing here? Oh, guess word got around... We may have made a few calls. This is all for us? Good luck, George! You can do it! Oh, my. Look, George. There's our buoy. And that's near where you spotted the hippocampus, right? Uh-huh. So are you boys ready for another adventure? This certainly wasn't on the schedule. Lead the way, George. Gee, when you're not in a runaway submersible, it's actually kind of nice down here. Oh, I see something. Is it the hippocampus? The mythical sea-horse! Well, it isa seahorse. Sorry, George, but this must be it. There's nothing else around here. Come in, Happy Clam. Did you find the ship? Negative. Just a towel. Oh, it's okay, George. Anyone can make a mistake. You did everything you could. It's time to say goodbye to Coddington. Poor Coddington. * Wish I could find * * Something better to say * * This isn't the way we wanted today * * To end * * Oh, it's hard * * Saying goodbye * * To a friend * * Trying to smile but it comes out sad * Oh, George! * After all the fun times we had * * To spend * * It's so hard * * Saying goodbye to a friend * George! * When summer is new * * Everyday seems to last and last * * Then you turn around * * And somehow summer is passed * * It all goes by so fast * * And though it hurts having to part * * I know in my heart * * We'll find ourselves here * * Oh, yeah * * But until then * * Guess I'm saying goodbye to a friend * * And it's hard * * Saying goodbye * * To a friend ** Thanks again for your help with the seals. And sorry the shipwreck didn't pan out. At least you gave us all quite an adventure, George. Thanks for everything! Let's go, George! Bye! What is it, George? Okay, George, we have a long drive and it looks like a storm's coming. George! George! George! What is it? Ah. Let me see. It looks like our seal pup is ringing the buoy bell. It sure seems to want something. You're right, George. He needs our help! Well... better safe than sorry! Um, where did all those boats come from? When the alarm sounds, all of Coddington comes running! George, wanna take the helm? Hold her steady. Point the bow at the buoy. Hey, you two! Yes, George. Something isgoing on down there. Let's drop a camera down and take a look. Right, George. There they are. Yes, George! The whale needs our help. Ahoy, Magellan! This is the coast guard. Everything okay? A humpback whale is trapped under a collapsed reef. Oh, dad, it's a whale! Oh, man. He needs our help! Copy that. And I just wish I knew what to do. The whale can only hold its breath for 45 minutes. That's right. Whales need to breathe air like monkeys and people. Wait, could we use the submersible to move the collapsed reef? It's not strong enough. And we're running out of time. George, what are you doing? Are you trying to give air to the whale? I'm afraid it doesn't work that way! Whoa! Oh, no! George! George! There she blows! My word! I've spent my life here looking for a single piece of treasure, and this little monkey visits and finds a 300-ton ship. George! How do you do these things? What do you say, Gertrude? Good enough for the museum? I can't believe it's been a whole year, George. - - Gah! Of course, I remember your bosun whistle. And your spyglass. Yeah, that seal was really something. George, I so wanted you to have the same Coddington vacation I had when I was a kid. That's right. You created new adventures for both of us. Oh, we gotta go! * Racing along * * Don't ever care * * Sun in your face * * Wind in your hair * * Humming a song * * And feeling so fine * * What could go wrong * * In the sweet sweet summertime * * Everything cool everything quiet * * Don't need a nickel to have a good time * * The days are bright * * As a shining new dime * * It's all going right in the sweet sweet summertime * * Curious delirious * * There's just no way you can be serious * * It's such a great sensation * * We're going on vacation * * Whoo * * No need for worries no frowns or frets * * Wherever you walk is as good as it gets * * Like a balloon * * That's starting to climb * * Happy today in the sweet sweet summertime * * No clouds in sight no sign of rain * * When things are so right no need to complain * * Me and my pal rocking the rhythm and rhyme * * Everything's great in the sweet summertime * * Anticipating that sweet sweet * * Sweet summertime * * What time is it? * * Sweet summertime * * What time is it? * * Sweet summertime ** * My my oh wow * * Look at where you are right now * * A place you never thought you'd be * * Right in the middle of a mystery * * Hey there ho there * * Everywhere you go there * * You're moving fast and floating free * * Right in the middle of a mystery * * Oh the mystery * * It's as cool as cool can be * * All the wonders you will see * * Right in the middle * * You're right in the middle * * Of a mystery * * Right in the middle * * Everyday that dawns is an open door * * To a world that you never knew before * * Everywhere you turn * * There's something new to understand * * Nothing like you think * * Ain't that great? * * My my oh yes * * What comes next you'd never guess * * Happiness is yours for free * * When you're right in the middle * * Of a mystery * * Oh the mystery, full of curiosity * * There's no better place to be * * Than right in the middle * * Smack-dab in the middle * * Way down in the middle * * Of a mystery * * My my * * Oh wow * * You know you're right in the middle * * Of a mystery **
