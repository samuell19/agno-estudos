Legally she's not even a runaway and it's obvious she's with this guy voluntarily so-- (tape recorder bangs) - John, wait a second. - What do you care? You don't even want her back in the first place. - That is a damn lie. - She disturbs your precious peace. - Oh don't you use that against me, don't you dare.

Come on, get out, Keep Watch. - For what? - Just get out. Now honey, a gun is just a tool. - To kill people. - Only if they're trying to hurt you or someone you love and only if it's loaded. Now Stace, Stace. Would you take the damn gun. - You, you, you're hurting me. - Don't make me hurt you more. Now take the gun. Take it.

He said you'd try that too. - All I want to do is get out of here. I want to go to Vegas but not with Richard. With you. Please. Come on. We can go, please-- - Do you think he just went through the drugstore to get some aspirin? What if this is a test? Huh? What if he's right outside that door, he could kill us both. - Maybe you're not so dumb after all. You okay? (Stacy crying) I keep telling ya, there ain't nothing to worry about. As soon as we get to Vegas we'll get married and everything will be okay. Okay? Stace? Okay? - Maybe before we get married, maybe I should go home. - Home? You are home with me. (Stacy crying) Aren't you? Aren't you? I love you, I do, but you're scaring me. - Come on now, don't cry. I can't stand to see you cry. What'll make you feel better? Hm? - Can I please call my folks?

(Stacy crying) - Oh, well I've been thinking, I've been thinking, the only, the only reason we can get in trouble is the checks, right? - What if I was to tell you I figured a way not to write any more. Hey, get some money so we can throw those checks away. Would you like that? - Yeah. - Good, good, good. Okay here's what we're gonna do.

Yeah that's right, all night while you've been boozing and sleeping I've been headed to the last place they'd ever expect us. (upbeat music) ♪ Oooh ♪ - Just feel like I should be here. - Yes sir. I understand that but just hanging around makes you tense. Now it'd much better if you just go about your normal routine. (phone ringing) - Hello? - Put your wife on. - Becky. - Just keep him talking. - Hello? - All right you listen and you listen good. You got the money? 30,000, we don't-- - Maybe you could ask that rich mom of yours down in Florida. Maybe she could sell one of her thoroughbred. - [Becky] Please don't-- - Just get it. I'll call tomorrow night and tell you wear to deliver. (phone beeps) - Why did she tell him about Florida? (somber music) - Home sweet home, honey. - Please just let me go. (traffic humming) Dad! (Stacy screaming) - Stacy? Stacy! (tires squealing) - [Stacy] Dad! (horn beeping) (tires squealing) - Stacy! Oh god. - You're here? - It's just that they caught some guy who claims he was with Brown and the girl. - Yeah this guy, Eddie Lowell, street kid from Newark. He was with brown when he picked her up. - What do we got on Brown? - Uh, he spent his childhood in a foster home, since then in and out of mental hospitals and jail, drugs and assault. The man is unpredictable, we assume he's dangerous. - Do we tell them that? - No, not unless it's absolutely necessary. Family's under enough strain as it is, well, with John losing his job and everything, all right? - Right, okay. - Let's go. - Please, please just let me go. I won't tell anyone, I promise you can just disappear. - I plan to, out of Miami, down to the islands. There's still time. You can still change your mind, come with me. If you love me, if you ever loved me-- - I loved you. If I loved you, you're the one wanting to leave, desert me. - How can I marry you? When they catch you they're gonna throw you in jail or... - Or what? - I don't want you to die. I don't want anybody to die. (somber music) - Well you see then, it could have been Stacey that John saw yesterday. - It's possible. - Well what do we know about this Richard Brown. - We're still checking on that. We know he's a trucker. The Oklahoma State Police found his rig parked at a truck stop just where Eddie Lowell said it would be when they picked him up in Texas. - Would he really hurt her? - Look, uh, we always have to be prepared for the worst but the good good news is from what we know now Stacey really wants to come home. (phone ringing) - Hello? - Don't talk. You so much as breathe wrong, she gets hurt. You double-cross me and she dies. You got that? - Yes. - [Richard] You got the money? - Not yet, the banks won't loan it to us and my mother-in-law has to sell something. - Yeah, well you got less than 24 hours, after that she's dead. - What do you expect us to do? - (sighs) You deliver the money, alone, to the Golden Waffle in Great Plains, Kansas, 8:00 a.m. tomorrow and remember Daddy, I know what you look like. (suspenseful music) - When do we leave? - We don't, Mr. Sapp. Now I understand how concerned you and your wife are but we can't put anyone else at risk here. - But you heard him. He knows what I look like. If you try to use one of your agents, he'll know. - If you can't keep your head and follow orders that's a risk we'll have to take. (suspenseful music) (kitten meowing) - Aw. (gun clicking) (cat meowing) - [Agent] The most important bit is going along with the plan. - But what happens to Stacy if he finds out you don't have the money? - Won't get that far, son. As soon as the FBI sees him, they can grab him. - Yeah they won't do anything to put her in danger. - Yeah right. - Look Johnny, I'm not gonna lie to you, okay. Things could go wrong but Mr. Harris and his agents are doing everything they can to make sure they don't and what I need from you is for you to stay here with your mom and be strong, okay? (somber music) (Becky sighs) - Told you, put the damn cat outside. - Please let me keep him, he'll make me happy. - Like I don't, right? Come here, come over here. (cat meowing) Not gonna hurt you. You know, all I ever want, all I ever wanted is to make you happy and you could be still. Stace. (cat meowing) Come with me, please. I love you. Please. (gentle music) (birds chirping) - Hey Johnny, wake up. - Becky, there's nothing you can do there. - If you were me, where would you be? At home, waiting for the phone to ring or with your husband and your daughter? - At least leave the boy. - No. - No, can't do that. He already feels responsible and well if anything were to happen he should be with his family. Look I know you're just trying to do your job, okay, but feeling for people isn't that part of it? (gentle music) - Let's go to Kansas, step on it, will ya? (diners chatting) - Here you go. (ominous music) - Ever read Romeo and Juliet? Forever, even in death but don't worry nothing's gonna happen but if it does, I promise I'll kill you first. (cat meowing) Come here. Come here. (cat meowing) Is that him? - That's him. (suspenseful music) (phone ringing) - Careful, could be watching you. - Golden Waffle. Who? If your name is John Sapp, there's a guy on the phone who wants to talk to you. - All right. (suspenseful music) - There you go. - Yes? - [Richard] Sapp. - Now what? Now she dies, I told you no cops. - What cops? There are no cops. - Yeah there better not be. - Look please for God's sakes, can we just get this over with? - Patience Daddy, patience. - I see him. (suspenseful music) - Can you get a shot? - Negative, he's using the girl as a shield and he's using binocs. - Miss. - Look Jed, we gotta move. Brown's expecting Sapp to walk out of here right now. - Hold, hold. Where's your restroom, Miss? - [Richard] Come on Daddy. - Look, what are you doing? He's already suspicious. He'll know. - We got to move. We can't risk any more lives. - Put this on, take your shirt off. - [Richard] Where are you? Come on, come on. - John, now look at me. You carry the bag out in front of you so Brown to see it. You take the stairs over there. When you get to the top of the stairs he can't see you anymore. That's where Don here is gonna take your place. - Now go. - No he'll see it's not me. - It'll never get that far, never get that far. Our snipers will take him out before then. - But look, just let me do it. - Look Sapp, I'm gonna say this you as straight as I can. Either do this my way or we're gonna get somebody else. Okay, button your shirt, come on. - Come on Daddy. (suspenseful music) What took you so long? - Everybody take position but be careful he's watching. Team two you get a shot, you take it. (suspenseful music) Come on Daddy, come on baby. Come on, come on. - He's starting up the stairs now. Team two. - He's pulled back. - What's wrong? - Wait till he sees me and I'm gonna over run 'em. - Don't do it. No, he's following orders. He's bringing the money, you don't have to hurt him. - A woman shall leave her father's house and claim onto her husband. - Oh no. - Forever. - No. - Give me the bag. - You're sure? - I'm sure, Mr. Sapp. - No don't kill him, no, Daddy. (Stacy screaming) - Stacy! - Watch out, Daddy, it's a trap. - [Jed] Damn it. - Let me go, let me go. - We got him, get him up. - Come on, let's go, let's go. Come on. - [John] Stacy! (police siren wailing) (suspenseful music) (glass shattering) (gunshot ringing) - Pull back! (glass shattering) (gunshot ringing) (diners screaming) (gunshots ringing) (diners screaming) - Hold you fire right there. Hold your fire. (police siren wailing) (gunshots ringing) (people screaming) - [Police Officer] He's got a second car. - [Police Officer] Get in the car. - [Police Officer] Get down, get down. (gunshots ringing) (Stacy screaming) (Officers shouting) - [Police Officer] Get down. - [Police Officer] Hold your positions. - [Police Officer] Stay there. Get down! (suspenseful music) - What the hell is happening? - We're still status quo sir. (door knocks) - Mr. Sapp, I brought you. - [John] Oh, thank God. I'm glad you're here. - Is Stacy okay? - What's happening - Mr. Harris is assessing the situation. We have a right to know. I'm sure they'll communicate with they know.

We have you surrounded. - Let her go, let her go. - [Stacy] No, he's hurting me now. (gunshots ringing) (suspenseful music) - [Dispatcher] One down, 29. (Dispatcher speaking faintly) One, three, four, One, three. - Look all we want to know is if she's okay. Oh God. - Now the truth is at this point we're not sure what happened over there. - So she she could be. - But we're not jumping to any conclusions. - Oh my God. - Now look, we'll be in this next room right over.

Will you do that for me now? - They want to know if they can pull out of the parking lot? - What will they give us? - How do I know? - You hungry? So am I, tell 'em. - He said he'll let you do it if you bring him some food. - All right, you tell him he's got a deal. - They said it's a deal. - One more thing, tell 'em, they screw up I'm gonna have to kill you.

Eat, go on eat. Eat! Give some to the cat, too. - Aren't you hungry? - Just keep eating. You have to eat to keep your strength up. - How much energy you think dying takes? Go on. (somber music) - Well they've sent in the food and they've established contact. - So they can negotiate? Right? - [John] That's right son. - I want to pray. (peaceful music) Um.

(crickets chirping) (suspenseful music) (phone ringing) - Did you really think I'd fall for that? (gun clicks) (gentle music) (people chattering) - Details are still sketchy about the hostage drama that has been unfolding the past 12 hours at this downtown motel. Neither police nor FBI will comment but KCRP has learned that the gunman is believed to be a criminal with a history of mental disturbance and that he has allegedly kidnapped an Illinois girl and is holding her for.

When you come out the door hold the kitten in both hands but hold it out away from your body, okay? (Becky and John sigh) (gentle music) - What do you want me to tell them? - Tell 'em the truth, tell 'em I loved you. - Remember, what you told me? Never let the bastards grind you down. Oh God, I wish I could take all your pain away. Please, please don't die. (gentle music) (cat meowing) - Here she comes. Get her downstairs, everybody else hold your positions. If that man makes a move you take him out. - [Don] My pleasure. (gentle music) - Let's go. - Go, go, go. Come on, go, go. - Walk fast. - Come on, come on, your free.
