(dramatic music) (gentle music) (monkeys screeching) (monkey chittering) (dramatic music) (gentle music) (monkey chittering) (speaking in foreign language) (splashes) (monkey chittering) (chimps chittering) (monkey chittering) (suspenseful music) (panther growling) (speaking in foreign language) (melancholy music) (dramatic music) (panther growling) (screams) Well, this makes twice in three weeks that one of our sentries has been attacked. Aye, poor fellow. Something else you hadn't counted on when you signed up with that agricultural development commission, eh lad? Have the men take care of the body, Eli. Notify his family. Tell them we'll do everything we can to, well, to see that they're all right. Yes bwana. (speaking in foreign language) Tell the others to get back to work. (speaking in foreign language) That includes you too, you know. This isn't a holiday. No bwana. You're paid to work, you know. Chop. Dig. Cut down trees. Yes bwana. [Rob] Well then why don't you do it? Yes bwana, no bwana. I don't think you even know what you're saying. No bwana. (scoffs) Eli, Eli, where are you? [Eli] Over here, bwana! Can't you make your men understand these tools are not meant to lean on? Have told 'em bwana and they don't seem to understand. Well they better learn. Otherwise we'll have to find a new crew. Have told 'em that too, bwana. They say fine, you do that. Well, um, keep after them. Yes, bwana. You're government commissioner of this territory. Isn't there something you can do about getting me more men? At least some men who are willing to work. There are superstitions about cutting down the trees, Rob. They say it'll make the jungle spirits angry and bring bad luck. When I signed on to turn this bit of jungle into a mechanized plantation, I had no idea that we'd have such trouble with our workmen. The few that we have won't even clear enough ground for my sister's vegetable garden. And now we have to contend with this, this killer beast. Your sister won't have to worry about her vegetable garden for long, I'm thinking. Oh? I don't follow you. The girl doesn't belong in a wilderness of this sort. It was a fine bit of foolishness to bring her. Best send her back, and the sooner the better. Judy'll be all right. My one main worry is when do I get more men. Well, one of my boys is out recruiting for you now. You can expect about 20 men sometime today, and about the same amount tomorrow. 20? (scoffs) I'll need at least 200 working full time to complete my schedules. That does call for a rare bit of patience, I'll admit. Calls for revision of these antiquated methods of operation. In Africa, that's gonna take a great deal of doing. Had you anything special in mind? Yes. Now look, for one thing, why do we have to cut the growth? Why can't we burn it, burn it as it stands? Holy cow, man! Have you ever seen a forest fire? It's hard to start, but once out of control you'd burn up half the continent. How could it possible get out of control if we backfire? This tract is situated on a huge bend on the river. This plantation is actually an island. Island or no, with the wind behind it the river would be no barrier. Nor would a backfire. Forget that idea. It'll take months to clear this island. It'll take time, you can resign yourself to that. Resign myself to it. You have no alternative! You can't remake Africa overnight! I think I'll make a try at it anyhow. That's what I was afraid you'd say. (light music) (suspenseful music) (screaming) (gun fires) Bomba. Luke rest, Bomba fix. Cat hurt friend Luke? Yes, jump from tree. What kind cat, panther? Big panther. Why cat leave Luke? Noise of gun scare him away. Panther black? Yes, black. Not leave Luke alone, please! (gentle music) Tis very nice of Monsieur Barnes to let us stay here at his station until you can have a house of your own built at the plantation. Mademoiselle, I'm finished with the first one. Mademoiselle, we start a new one, I'm finished. I'm sorry Losana, I'm afraid I wasn't listening. Perhaps mademoiselle finds her new life a little boring. Well I suppose it has an advantage over being buried alive. I think Monsieur Barnes and your brother are coming. (light music) We'll finish this later, Losana. Oui, mademoiselle. - Hi. - Hi yourself. Did you have a busy day at the office? Wish I had. Oh, would you mind pouring us something cold to drink? Oui monsieur. And don't spare the ice. Of course, monsieur. That's something else you must go easy on, Robbie. Too much ice doesn't mix well with the sun. Sometimes I think you must be joking about all these prohibitions. I'm only trying to make you realize, Robbie, that Africa resents intrusions. You must educate her slowly, and in a language that she understands, otherwise you'll never make any progress with her. Lots of men come, bwana. (bird calling) I don't hear them. Well if he says they're coming you may be sure they are. I think I heard something. (suspenseful music) The recruits I was telling you about. - Bring 'em in, Eli. - Yes, bwana. (speaking in foreign language) Hm, ambitious looking boys, aren't they? Oh, but the usual. Probably don't know one end of the shovel from another. They will when I get through with them. These men come work for you. This one head man, name Moki. Oh fine. Tell 'em this Bwana Maitland, their boss. You might add that I'll be paying them to work, not sit in the shade and smoke. Oh Rob. (speaking in foreign language) Where are they going? Stop them, Eli! Where are they going, Eli? Sorry, bwana, Moki say no like number two missy. Say got evil eye. Go inside Losana and quickly! (speaking in foreign language) Moki say got spirit of jungle cat, maybe panther, not sure. Oh no. Can't you stop them? Tell them if they stay, we'll give them salt. (speaking in foreign language) Moki say how much? Oh, double handful to each man. That oughta do it. (speaking in foreign language) Moki say men stay. I go with them now to get food. (speaking in foreign language) What was that all about, Mr. Barnes? Oh, the natives believe that a soul of a dying animal sometimes takes refuge in the body of a human being. (scoffs) You're joking. Well, I won't argue the point with you. Incidentally, who is this maid of Judy's? How did you come by her? Oh we found her when we got off the boat. Or rather, she found us. She asked for the job, and well, I felt that Judy could do with the company of somebody her own age out here in the bush, so... (laughs) She says she's French. Aye, French no doubt. And Portuguese, and Italian, with a dash of Arab most likely. A rare combination. Well, I'm going to freshen up before dinner. Oh, I nearly forgot. The mail packet arrived today. You both have letters inside. Oh, fine! What a shock! First time in four years it's been on schedule. (dramatic music) Well, that's about it. Mr. Barnes. - What is it? - Come here. It's Luke, and Bomba! This way Bomba, bring him in here! Eli, Losana! Easy now. Here, over here. That's it, easy does it. Easy, Luke. (mysterious music) You called, monsieur? Oh, get water and towels Losana, and a first aid kit. Oui, monsieur. Quickly, Losana! How did this happen? Bomba, tell me what happened? Bomba find Luke hurt. Say panther jump from tree. Amazing. A thousand miles of jungle and you just happened along. Not happen, Bomba track panther. Black cat is killer. Black panther. Do you suppose that could be the one that's been attacking my men? It's possible. Woods are full of cats. Most cats kill for food. Panther kill just to kill. - Must die. - I hope so. My men may walk out on me if it strikes again. Well don't just stand there, lend a hand! Oui, monsieur. Who is this fellow? He's not a native. Oh, he's one of those African legends. You wouldn't believe. His parents must have died somewhere in the bush when he was a baby. He was taken in too by a half-deaf scientist named Cody Casson and lugged into the wilderness beyond the great rift. Casson's been dead these 13 years. How the boy managed to survive is a miracle. [Rob] Amazing. There, that'll do for the time being. You know, this might work out fine. Look, I'd like to introduce myself. My name is Rob Maitland. I Bomba. I was wondering if you'd like to sign on with me. You could be a tremendous help in my work. Work? What is work? Mr. Maitland is tearing out the jungle, cutting it down so that he can plant some new trees. Cut down trees, then plant more trees? Why? Does sound a bit silly when you put it flat like that, doesn't it? Not to me, it doesn't. The point is, will you help me? No. Why not? Bomba hunt panther. Well that's exactly what I want you to do. I'll pay you well. Pay? What is pay? He means he'll give you some of these every day for helping him. - Eat? - No, no, you don't eat them, you buy things with them. Buy? Doesn't the boy understand anything? He does, but not the things you do. Buy means that people will give you things for those coins. (sighs) Clothes, for instance. Mine better. Well you can get a rifle with 'em. Not need rifle, have (speaking in foreign language). He's incredible. He doesn't understand the most elementary things. You're wrong, Robbie. It's you who don't understand the elementary things. Who was that I just saw leaving? One of Africa's legends. A chap who lives beyond the rift. They tell me that he... (gentle music) I Bomba. Soft. You help work? Well I don't exactly chop trees if that's what you mean. Miss Judy has to learn her way around the jungle first. Good, Bomba stay. Show jungle enemies, show friends. There's real merit in that idea, laddie. You know if Miss Judy could see the country through Bomba's eyes, in good time she might come to like it. Monsieur, mademoiselle, dinner is served. You'll stay and eat with us Bomba of course? No. Bomba get own food. Well, independent seems to be the word for Bomba. Well maybe he can help us get rid of that cat. You like swim? Why, yes but I... (light music) You say you like swim. You not like swim? No monsieur, merci beaucoup. Bomba not understand what she saying. She speaks another language. She said no, but thank you very much. Why she come? She not like swim. You'll have to ask my brother, it was his idea. (suspenseful music) Monsieur! Mademoiselle! (jaguar growling) (buffalo lowing) Down. (cats growling) (suspenseful music) Let's get out of here. Buffalo make good fight. That was terrible. Buffalo not like leopard. What sort of an excuse is that? You think better run from things you not like? Of course, why not? Bomba not like panther hurt Luke. You think better Bomba run? I don't know. All I know is I hate this country and everything in it. It's brutal and ugly. Bomba see many things not ugly. (light music) Oh, better start burning that, Moki. Understand? Fire. Kerosene? Yes, I'll send you the kerosene. (suspenseful music) Eli. - Eli! - Yes bwana. Send the kerosene in to Moki, he's ready to start burning. Yes bwana. Hello Mr. Barnes! Antelope for dinner, Robbie. What's come over your men? Some of them seem to be working for a change. Well, I've decided to introduce a little efficiency into Africa. Oh? How? I divided the men into squads and promised prizes to the ones doing the most work. Shaving mirrors and old dinner bells and such trinkets. I see. Well you don't have to be so disappointed because I've solved one of my problems. No, laddie. Only when you distribute the prizes I would suggest that you give some to all the men. Yes, but that would destroy the spirit of competition I hoped to create. Maybe. But if you don't, you're going to have some rare cases of mayhem and larceny on your hands. (suspenseful music) (panther growling) (screaming) (speaking in foreign language) Oh! Oh he's gone. If you hadn't got in my way I might have had him. (speaking in foreign language) Moki say not plain panther, that taboo cat. You not hurt him. Poor devil never had a chance. Eli says that's a taboo cat. What does that mean? Oh, some sort of evil jungle spirit no doubt. Something to be feared but not molested. But he's got to be killed! He's a menace to all their lives! Easy, lad. If you or I try to kill it, every native will walk off the place. Better let Bomba track it down without anybody knowing it. (speaking in foreign language) What prompted her to show up just at this moment? Bwana, men go away. Call them back! Tell them I won't give them the salt I promised if they leave. Yes bwana. Is something wrong, Rob? Panther just got one of the workmen. The natives called it a taboo cat. Sort of a jungle spirit. Getting even for cutting down the trees. Panther killer. Same cat Bomba track. Same cat hurt Luke. But the natives seemed afraid of us. Not you, Losana. They think she's some kind of a reincarnated cat, remember? A cat, monsieur? But that is too funny. I have been called kitten before, but never cat. I must go talk with them. You'll do nothing of the sort. Moki say men stay, but must keep number two missy at station. I won't give into their superstitions! You'd better. Moki say no like Bomba this place too. Say not let Bomba kill taboo cat, bwana. Bomba is only gonna drive it away. In the meantime, Losana'll go back with me to the station and stay there. Eli, get the men back to work. Yes, bwana. Look Rob. Why don't we give up this whole sorry business and go back where we know our way about? You mean give up just because the going gets a little rough? That's exactly what I mean. (scoffs) You're joking. I'm not. I'm just being realistic. You're not fitted for this job, and I wanna go back home where life means more than just heat and insects, superstition, and certain failure. I would have expected something better than that from you, Judy. (sighs) (speaking in foreign language) (suspenseful music) (lion growling gently) (light music) (suspenseful music) (arrow thwacks) (dramatic music) (gentle music) We'd better start back now. Why? It's getting late and Rob'll be going back to the station. (speaking in foreign language) Oh, animals afraid of man. Yes, I know. You not be afraid of Bomba. (ax thudding) See what I mean? Cut it slanting, not straight in. Now, you try it. (ax thudding) Oh, do it your own way. Maybe sometime you'll break the confounded thing. Yes bwana. (murmuring in foreign language) Well. You're certainly not afraid of work. You'd fall right to sleep beside it. Why haven't you set fire to that pile? I gave you matches. Oh no, this can't be real. It's some sort of conspiracy. Eli, Eli! Eli! Eli! (murmuring in foreign language) Eli, Eli. Yes, bwana. Why haven't those men lighted the brush as I ordered? Say not cold, bwana, not need fire. Do they think I'm doing it for their comfort? (speaking in foreign language) Why are those men laying down their tools? Not work anymore. Not work anymore? What's wrong now? Say you not keep Bomba away like they ask. Bomba's not here. Was here. Went that trail with Missy Judy long time. (sighs) All right, call your men back to work. I'll keep Bomba away. Yes boss. (shouting in foreign language) This is where Rob intends building our house. We'll clean out the cave and put a door on it. Live in cave? No, we'll keep our food in it. Plenty of food in trees. Always fresh. I don't mean that kind of food. The kind we'll store is... Judy! Judy! He that way. Oh, I thought I heard voices. I was hoping I'd find you, I... Where's Losana? We left her home on account of the natives and that evil eye business. You shouldn't be wandering about this way, Judy. Oh, don't be silly, Rob. There's nothing to be afraid of. Nothing hurt Judy. (speaking in foreign language) It won't do, Bomba. The men object to your remaining here. They say that you're to blame for the panther stalking the camp. Bomba not afraid of men. Bomba stay. Kill panther. Of course, it's a menace to us all. I'm afraid you'll have to go. The natives don't want to anger the jungle spirits. Bomba not believe in jungle spirits. Only believe in... (panther growling) (suspenseful music) (gentle music) You'll admit, lass, it has a beauty all its own. I'd be the last to deny that. And yet your mind's a thousand miles across the sea. Listening to small talk in some snug little Canadian parlor. Is there anything wrong with that? No, not wrong. But foolish. Foolish to mourn over things that are gone. Since when is it foolish to wanna be happy? Happiness doesn't lie in having the things you like, but in liking the things you have. That's a neat trick if you can do it. Ah, it isn't too difficult. Just look about you with an honest eye. You'll find things with a great deal more purpose than golf or tea or bridge. There's real work to be done here. Guess the trouble is I haven't the character to... The trouble is you're lazy, lass. You want to accept everything that life has to offer without lifting a finger to earn it. Mr. Barnes could you come in here for a minute. Coming, Robbie. You've character enough, Judy lass. Thought it might take a tidal wave or an earthquake to bring it out in you. Would you mind taking a look at the plans for the house? Ah, not bad. Not bad at all. A wee bit too pretentious in spots, but on the whole it's very sensible. One thing, though. Don't forget a good, tight root cellar. I plan to use the cave you showed me on our first trip around the tract. Ah, perfect. And with a good stout door opening outwards. Why opening out? So that the wind pressure'll keep it shut rather than blow it open. You know, we have an occasional windstorm of sizeable proportions from the village. Tornado? Oh, not as bad as that, but a wee bit too stiff for comfort. (gentle music) (suspenseful music) (gentle music) (hooting) Oh, oh. It's only me, you silly bird. (gasps) Well. So nice of you to drop in. Go home. I beg your pardon? It's bad enough taking order from Rob without... Bad be in jungle alone. Bomba take Judy home. I know my way back if I wanna go. Go now, taboo cat this part. I don't believe there is any taboo cat. (panther growling) You hear? Judy go! (gentle music) There, once we get this acreage burned out it'll... Robbie, Robbie... Rob, Mr. Barnes! Judy, what's the matter? The panther, it's out there, I heard it! Well, there's nothing to worry about. We'll just leave it there. But Bomba's trailing it, and with nothing but that spear! In the dark? He'll get himself killed! Oh I doubt that, but we'll better take no chances. (suspenseful music) What you do here? What you do here, monsieur? You follow Losana, no? Bomba follow taboo cat. You follow taboo cat and you find me. (laughing) That is very funny. Not funny. Panther close by. I'm not afraid to see panther. Please, you will not leave me alone in the wood. You're not afraid panther. But I am so lonely and you are (speaking in foreign language). Ah well, (speaking in foreign language). And they'll never be so young again. Where's Bomba, what happened to him? Don't worry about Bomba, he's in good hands. What do you mean by that? That panther he was chasing turned out to be Losana. But there was a panther, Rob, I heard it scream! One'll get you 20 that Losana's taking the night off. Maybe you're both right. You know what the natives say about her. The less you see of your friend Bomba, the better. - But I... - Well we better get some sleep, goodnight Robbie. - Goodnight Judy. - Goodnight Mr. Barnes. I'll see you tomorrow. - Goodnight. - Night. (gentle music) You home, Bomba go. It is early to retire, and it is much nicer here in the moonlight, no? Losana! Losana! Coming, mademoiselle. (speaking in foreign language) What does mademoiselle wish? Oh, my negligee please. Where did you leave it? On the bed like always, mademoiselle. I do not know what could... There it is, mademoiselle. Well I wonder how it got under there. I was wondering the same thing myself, mademoiselle. Losana, did I actually see you kissing that, that jungle boy? May no, mademoiselle. But you would have in another minute. In fact, I thought that was why you call me. Why on earth should I care what happens to you and Bomba? (speaking in foreign language) Mademoiselle, but that is question only mademoiselle can answer. Naturally, I'll stay in today if you think it best, Rob. But really I think you're making a mountain out of a molehill. It's only a precaution. After all, the boy is a stranger. Well it's bad enough to even be here without being confined to quarters. It won't be for long. I've decided you're going home on the next packet. Oh Rob, you don't mean it! Why not? We may as well face it. After all, you really don't belong out here and (laughs) well that's all there is to it. Oh, hello Bomba. Thought you'd left by now. - Soon. - Good. Everything set, Eli? Yes, bwana. Got nuts, got food, got matches, got salt, got kerosene. All here, bwana. Make very happy. Now Bomba, would you mind lending a hand? - Where Judy? - Inside. She's not going with us this morning. All right Eli. (gentle music) You go jungle this day? No, I'm afraid not, Bomba. Bomba show lion cubs, two! No thank you. I've got some letters I ought to write. Judy like write letters more than lion cubs? No, not especially. But it has to be done, you know. Next day, maybe. I don't think so. You see, I expect to be busy here at the station for the next couple of days, Bomba. Judy not speak true. I beg your pardon? I'm not in the habit of being told... Judy not speak true. Judy not like Bomba. Bomba go. (monkey chittering) Hm. I think I want to go to the clearing after all today, Bomba. And I don't think I should go alone. Not with a taboo cat on the prowl. This girl like Bomba. That doesn't concern me at all. Do as you please. (gasps) Well, goodbye. (fire crackling) Well, we'll never get anywhere this way. Tell your men to pile the brush among the trees. We'll try burning out a small section of the jungle. Don't you understand what I said? I understand, but Bwana Barnes said... I know what he said! Suppose it does burn off half of Africa. Huh, small loss if you ask me. Yes bwana. (speaking in foreign language) Brother work that way, not far, you find him. I find him? Aren't you coming with me? Brother not want Bomba. Oh, that. What's over that way? River. Let's go have a look at it. I've never seen the entire island. Brother not like. Oh who cares? This'll probably be my last chance. I'm taking the next boat back home. You still not like this place? I don't know what I like anymore. Anyway, Rob's already made the decision for me. He thinks I'm a softy, and so does Mr. Barnes. They right. You soft. Well that seems to make it unanimous! (laughs) (suspenseful music) Not go river. What's the matter, is something dangerous? Ugly, not like. (gasps) Do you suppose there are any on this side? Not know. (gasps) (thrashing) Why doesn't he run? He'll be killed! Buffalo not like crocodile. (buffalo lowing) (dramatic music) Why does he wanna fight everything he doesn't like? Not want to, have to. Got little one in the brush. We go now, not pretty. Isn't there something we can do to help? Buffalo not need help. Come. (buffalo lows) You can tell the men to pour this in the brush pile among the trees. (speaking in foreign language) Moki say men not help you burn jungle. As long as they're working for me they'll do as I say. (speaking in foreign language) Moki say you burn jungle, they not help you, they go home. They can do as they please, but I'm gonna burn the jungle. (speaking in foreign language) You'll get no salt! They think that scares me, they're crazy. We'll spread the oil ourselves. - What is it, Bomba? - Taboo cat. Fresh tracks. Go that way, not far. Come on, let's get outta here! What are you standing there for? Come along! Judy go. Bomba not run away from bad things. (fire crackling) We'll start at opposite ends of the brush piles and work toward the middle. Bwana Barnes say not do. Well there's nothing to be afraid of. I'm going to light a backfire first. Eli very afraid, bwana. Eli very afraid. Well then go on back to camp! I'll manage on my own from here on. Yes, bwana. (wind whistling) Taboo cat close by. Judy go? No. If it's got to be done, let's get it over with. (birds flapping) What is it, Bomba? Not know. Animals afraid. (cats growling) (monkeys chittering) (elephants screeching) Look Bomba! Air bad, bwana. Heat bad, think storm come. Ah, I noticed it myself. Does seem a bit muggy. What's that you say, a storm? Not know, bwana. Feel same way like before. By the saints, it does. There's no pressure at all! It's just like the... (crashing) Quick bwana, go to the cellar! (wind whistling) (dramatic music) (fire crackling) Eli, Eli! (crashes) Bwana! Eli! Where's the ax? (ax thudding) Fire! (fire roaring) Get rocks, make door. (thunder rumbling) (rain pattering) (spear snaps) (dramatic music) Panther in cave. (panther growling) (panther roaring) (screams) (breathing heavily) (gentle music) Well at least there's one thing to be thankful for. At least Judy and Eli and Bomba didn't pay for my stupidity with their lives. How one man could be so many kinds of a fool. Now I suppose you're ready to pack up and leave. On the first packet downriver. I just don't belong. As you pointed out from the first. I'd have expected something better than that from you, Rob. Personally, I can't see giving up a fight just because the going gets a little rough. Do you know what you're saying? I think I do. I'm saying let's stick and see this thing through. Yesterday you wanted to quit. That was yesterday. Today things seem to be a little different somehow. I knew you had the spirit Judy lass, I knew it! (smacks leg) Oh Rob, I'd suffocate back there under all of that, that stuffiness. Life isn't something to be absorbed, it has to be lived. Judy. (gentle music) Bomba go now. Bomba, you can't go now, our work here is just beginning. Bomba's work done. Panther dead. Goodbye. Sometime Bomba come see friends. There goes the lad you said had no understanding of the elementary things, Robbie. I'll miss him. (mysterious music) (dramatic music)
