(Ominous instrumental music) (Tiger growl) (Ominous instrumental music) (Aggressive yell) (Growl) (Ominous instrumental music) [Man] Ah! (Growl) Ah! (Growl) (Growl) You're late. So what? Whose the gorilla? Chong. I wouldn't get too close if I were you. Why? He just spent nine months undergoing a psych evaluation. Tomorrow at trial, he's gonna plead insanity. He's not crazy. Hey, scumbag, that bother you? What are you, deaf? Oh, so I've gotta teach you some manners, huh? Give me the keys. Fred, I don't think we should —... Give me the keys. Hear me? Don't ignore me when I'm talking to you. You look at me, or I'm gonna smash your face. Aargh! (Cell door closing) (Sirens wailing) (Dramatic instrumental music) Your weapons will be delivered as promised. I see no reason to negotiate any further. Time to, as they say, put up or shut up. (Metal clanging) (Guns firing) Freeze! Don't move. Drop it. We've been set up. (Gun cocking) (Gun firing) Stevie, Stevie. My own people, Steve, huh? Victor, I didn't know she was a cop, man. I didn't know. We go way back, huh. We've know each other since we were kids. Listen, Stevie, listen... (Intense instrumental music) I'm okay. I'll get them. [Tarek] Victor! Waste him. (Guns firing) Drop it. I got him! (Gun firing) (Tires screeching) (Gun firing) (Loud explosion) (Loud explosion) (Sirens wailing) Hands up! Keep 'em up. My partners been shot. Call an ambulance! Now! Was that your partner, Richards? If I knew that, I would have shot her in the head. Get out of the car. Let's go. (Automatic gun firing) (Gun firing) I'm actually glad you guys were late for our meeting. Thank you for the help. Don't thank us. Thank dai lo fu. Okay. This should change my mood. You guys must think I'm as dumb as you look. You know, I like to think of myself as having a pretty good sense of humor, but right now, I'm not in the mood for stupid games. Now, where's the rest of my cash? Where are the weapons? Don't you worry about your weapons. You'll get them delivered when I get paid in full. You'll get the rest when we get the weapons. That was not the deal. Deals change. (Speaking in Chinese) Enough with this Chinese bullshit. Come here. I tell you how it's going to be, not the other way around. Do you understand that? Now, I would like to go and see your dai lo fu face to face. Dai lo fu's in San Francisco. Oh, isn't that convenient. That happens to be where your weapons are coming in. Let's take a little trip. Let's go see dai lo fu. [Patch] Before we go, we have to pick someone up. (Dramatic instrumental music) Thanks for the ride, Harry. How about dinner? No. I told you, I don't date partners. What does dinner have to do with dating? It's just as well. You'd probably be in body bag, anyway. What's that suppose to mean? You didn't hear? Your ex boyfriend's new partner just got killed in a shoot out. Is tarek okay? You're gonna have to call down to the station to check it out. See ya. Thanks. Yah! Yah! Yah! (Telephone ringing) Hello. Hi tarek, it's Linda. How are you? [Tarek] It's nice to hear your voice. I heard about your new partner, I'm really sorry. So am I. She deserved better. Is there anything I can do? [Tarek] I'm not sure. Well, I'll tell you what. I'll fax you my new address and I think you should come to San Francisco and visit. You'd really like it. Yeah, maybe someday. You take care of yourself. Okay, you too. Bye. Yah! Yah! (Intense instrumental music) Judgment day. Richards, the trial starts in 10 minutes. If you're not there, the captain is going to have a fit. Copy. (Siren wailing) (Intense instrumental music) (Woman screaming) (Guns firing) Dai lo fu sent us. He needs you. Sifu choy is dead. How? I don't know. [Radio] All units respond. Precinct one, gunshots fired. I'm on my way. Lock all the exits. Don't let Chong escape. (Guns firing) So, you're the famous death dealer. Death dealer. Who is he? Mr. Chong, meet Victor. He'll be traveling with us to San Francisco. We need to get rid of this Van. [Radio] Richards, we've just found a body. I think you should have a look at it. East side, Brooklyn bridge. Copy. Tell them not to touch a thing until I get there. [Man] Haven't touched a thing. Dai lo fu. Sifu choy. So, what do you think? This guy was a fighter. (Telephone ringing) Hello. Hi, it's Linda. I need your help. [Tarek] What's up? We've just found a victim that has tiger claw markings. Do you think it's a copy cat? I think it's something bigger. We just had the same thing here. Did you hear of Chong's escape. Linda, Linda, talk to me. [Linda] Do you think it's Chong? Probably not. The victim's face was slashed by a killer missing a finger. Could you run a search on two names for me? Sifu choy and dai lo fu. I'll check in to it. I'll call you back. [Tarek] All right. Bye. (Intense instrumental music) What's the problem? Can you fix it? I think I can fix it. I need a screwdriver. Hey, where are you going? Cops! I left my gun inside. (Knocking on truck) Get rid of them. Give them whatever they want. How are you doing? I'll have a belly buster and a large coke. I'll have one of those double deckers and a sprite. I see you've got a problem with your truck. Ah, let's have a look. That ought to do it. Yep! Hey, I think we've got a problem here. Yeah, look at this. I don't see a problem here, gentlemen. Do you? Boys. (Guns firing) Get in the truck. Well, if we don't have any more screwups, we'll be at the airport in an hour, San Francisco by morning. (Telephone ringing) Hello. Good news. Master choy lives here in San Francisco. At least, he did. But my Chinatown connection says that he's missing. Dai lo fu actually means "big tiger," but it's also the name of choy's student, who now runs his business. What business? It's a martial arts school that's now a restaurant. I think I'll accept your invitation after all. See you tomorrow. (Intense instrumental music) Hi, tarek. Hello, Linda. (Intense instrumental music) I would like to keep the San Francisco police out of this as long as possible. It's a personal thing. Well, the da feels that we don't have enough evidence to move in, anyway. What about you? I'm convinced. And I just happen to have a few days off, so I'd like to work with you. It's a personal thing. What did you find out? We've had reports of some known underground fighters arriving in the city. And the mysterious dai lo fu is hosting a tournament on new years Eve. Where? We don't know. Fighters don't even know that yet. Let's find out. (Intense instrumental music) Why don't you sit down, have a drink. I'll tell dai lo fu you're here to speak with him. She'll take care of you. Hi. How are you this evening? Very well, thank you. Come this way, please. Your waitress will be right with you. Thank you. (Intense instrumental music) We can't go in right now. Besides, if Chong sees us, he'll run. He might not even be here yet. Let's go up there. You always do pick the classiest places. Don't I? Hi. I'd like a room. Cash only. How much? Hundred bucks. I hope you're worth it. Well, lets find out, handsome. Very nice. It'll do. I've missed you. I've missed you, too. To work. (Camera shutter clicks) I'm glad you're here. (Ominous instrumental music) My apologies for not being able to speak with you sooner. So much to prepare for. It's good to see you again. I was not surprised by sifu's death. He was old and it was his time. He asked if I ever saw you again to give you this. What does it mean? We will cross paths again. Not in this world. Since our teacher's death, you're the only family I have. Master choy taught us we are brothers of the black art. Do you remember when we were young, the ancient stories of the sacred tigers? Stories. Not just stories. Myths. Master choy's dying request was that you and I reunite for this event. You must agree to be part of this. Tomorrow marks the turn of our century. It's our only chance to prove the stories. If we miss this chance, it won't happen again for a hundred years. I must have time to think. Don't take too long. (Camera shutter clicks) Let me take over for a while. Good luck. Hello, Victor. Take good care of my guest, here. Anything he wants is on the house. I'll have a scotch on the rocks, please. And make it a double. Why did you come to see me? I thought we made a deal. I give you the money, you give me the guns. Well, your boys changed the deal. They only gave me half. Perhaps they wanted to keep the other half for themselves. My people are loyal. Well, maybe you're the one trying to rip me off then. How soon can I have my guns? As soon as I get my $250,000. Your money will be here in a few minutes. (Drums beating) So, what's this? Celebrations. And what are we celebrating? I'm hosting a martial arts tournament on Chinese new year. This year is exceptionally special. It's a centennial year. (Drums beating) (Audience applauding) [Victor] It would appear we have a deal. I'll have my two disciples accompany you. Just make sure you don't have any further misunderstandings. It's Victor. (Camera shutter clicks) I'm going after him. Okay. I'll wait here for Chong. (Intense instrumental music) (Metal grinding) Yeah, this is the one for Tony. Right here. Yeah, see, this one. [Victor] Escobar. Hey, Victor. Good to see you. Good to see you, too. California life has treated you well, my friend. You're looking good, too. These are our clients. You took care of that business we spoke of? Yes. Good. Perhaps we could show them a sample. Okay. To your satisfaction? Okay, let's go. Load it. You know, you boys really need to learn how to relax. Sit down. We'll have a drink. Live a little. We're like a family around here. A toast to new acquaintances and old friends. Boys! Aah! Richards! (Guns firing) Go. I'll take care of it. (Guns firing) Give it up. Drop the gun. (Gun firing) Ahh! (Sirens wailing) Thanks. His story checks out. [Cop] So, what do you want to do with him? Let him know we don't like New York cowboys. Where's Masterson? I work alone. Hey, come on. What do you think, we're stupid? I don't particularly care if you're a cop. My advice to you is go back to your hotel, pack your bags and make tracks. No problem. I know it's not a problem, 'cause we'll be checking in on you. Count on it. Hey, there you are. I was looking for you. We want to see your spirit in fighting form. Is it? Perhaps a little workout would be in order. As a token of your appreciation for my getting you out. If you would be so kind as to accompany these gentlemen, I'm sure we'll know soon enough if you're still in fighting form. - |'|| try. Leave me alone. I told you I have no money. Since dai lo fu took over, Chinatown is hell. What was once a respectable place is now a disaster. Think about what he's done. The once beautiful fu jow school is now a restaurant front for his mob. All he thinks about is money and power and now, he controls everything. You better tell me how much money do you have. I told you, I have no money. [Goon] You know what to do. No. You've just made the biggest mistake of your life. Sayonara! Why have you come to see me again? I want to discuss doing some more business together. Our business is over, my friend. You should leave. I've other pressing matters to deal with. You're wrong. Our business is over when I say it's over. I see. Perhaps we should talk. Then talk. I would like to enter your tournament. I want to be a competitor like Chong. You know I have the skill and the power to win that tournament. At which time I will gain the confidence of your men, and then I will train them in using the weapons which you purchased from me, and you and I can become an unstoppable force. I am not looking for any more competitors or partners. I don't care what you're looking for. I'm in whether you want me in or not. You must first qualify. No problem. Tarek, I followed Chong to this restaurant and I saw him turn on dai lo fu's men and save a cook. I'm not surprised. Why? Chong is an honorable man, but what connects him to dai lo fu... that's a mystery. Dai lo fu just bought a truckload of weapons from Victor. So, now what? Tomorrow's Chinese new year. I'm sure dai lo fu's up to something big. I have to get in there. Count me in. I hope you slept well. When I asked you to accompany my men last night, I wanted to see if your spirit was in fighting form. You demonstrated it is. Unfortunately, my men failed in their mission. This must be dealt with. Incompetence bears a heavy price. (Maniacal laughter) I don't trust Chong. Why are we having this tournament, anyway? Why not just have the ceremony to open the passage? Patch, I don't trust anyone. The tournament is part of the tradition. He's not stupid. You should understand, sifu's death is a chance for both of us to become leaders. Remember the chi kung prayers. The key to unlock the sacred tiger passage. We will be able to bring modern medicine and knowledge back to help our ancestors. We will be their heroes and protectors. Hey, that doesn't go there. That goes in aisle 20. (Whistles) Hey, you shouldn't be in here. (Yelling) I welcome you all to this evening, which will be for all of us the most important event in our lives. Tonight marks the beginning of Chinese new year, the key to the future and the past. Tonight, we will once again be able to control our destiny. To prove to our ancestors that we are worthy to meet them, we must first prove our skills. So, we have invited some of the greatest fighters to join in our tournament. Let us begin. Not yet. Richards, what a surprise. Still the strong, silent type, huh? Boy, you sure had me fooled with that. Looks like a real screamer. I should kill you right here and now. A friend of mine from the east coast. Honor us by joining our ceremony. You've got to be kidding. If I win, you'll let her go? Of course. Take her away. The tournament will be concluded at the fu jow temple. The four finalists will join me in the opening of the passage. Richards. Good luck. If it's games you want, I'll play. Have fun. (Maniacal laughter) (Ominous instrumental music) Thanks. Make a wish. Why? Ahh! Sounds deep. You are dai lo fu's prisoner, aren't you? He's going to kill you. I don't think so. Dai lo fu is not a person to be taken lightly. Well, neither am I. There's no way out. Or do you think I like it here? Who are you? An old man who made a mistake. Allow me to explain. Many, many years ago, the grand masters of the fu jow temple created a time corridor so that the worthy martial arts students of the future can return to the ancient temple for their final grading. Until this century, students would return to the temple every 10 years, but then, the chain was broken. The passage can only be reopened on the first full moon of the centennial new year. That moon is tonight. Well, if I were to believe in this ancient, secret passageway, why does dai lo fu need Chong to bring Victor's weapons into the past? Dai lo fu is the north wind and Chong is the south. Both are needed to open the corridor. How do you know all this? Both were my students. Dai lo fu has betrayed me and Chong has disappeared. You're master choy? Chong is here, and he's helping dai lo fu out because he thinks you're dead. Now we'll determine who will be the four finalists. (Intense instrumental music) (Bell clanging) Hi. — how are you doing? Good. How's the family? They're good? Your wife's okay now, right? Last night, there was a guy here with dark hair like mine. And a lady with blonde hair, very beautiful. I need you to tell me where they went. I didn't see anybody like that. You didn't see anybody? Hey, if we want to, we can tear apart this place, room by room. I told you. Nobody here. [Cop a] You know, honesty's always been a part of our relationship. I don't understand this. [Cop b] Hey, don't bullshit us. Let me help you remember. Ah, you remembering? Now, I remember. Good. Goddamn. This is unbelievable. What? What? Yeah, what? What are we looking for? We're looking for anything that can get us ahead of tarek Richards. Why? I mean, he's out of his jurisdiction, right? Exactly. We get ahead of Richards, we bust Chong. We bust Chong, we're ahead of the game, buddy. I'm pretty good at this. Voila! Now, let's get out of here. It's useless. Wait. I have an idea. Give me your hands. Whoa! Now try. (Clapping) Congratulations. The four of you have reached our finals. Let us proceed with the opening of the passage. (Dramatic instrumental music) Open the passage. Dai lo fu. You have betrayed all that I have taught you. Master? If you remember my teachings, then you understand why the tigers will not accept you. You are not a true master. To be a true master, you have to become selfless. Dai lo fu, you have failed. Sifu. (Gun firing) [Tarek] It's over, Victor. Get in there and help your boss. Linda. Don't worry about me. I never have. No! Yah! You should have known better. Come on. Yah! Chong isn't here. Spread the word. Find him and kill him. (G rowl) (G rowl) Big man with a little stick. (Laughing menacingly) (G rowl) Aah! You're nothing, Richards. You're just a public servant who bit off more than he could chew. Bite this. Take me back home. I would like to die in the old land. What about Chong? Let's go get him. (Growling) Wait. Let him go. He's paid his dues. What just happened there? I don't know, but we have nothing else to do here. (Sirens wailing) You have a lot of cleaning up to do. Later. (Gong clanging) We have been expecting you. (Brooding instrumental music)
