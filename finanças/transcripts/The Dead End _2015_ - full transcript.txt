Everything has a beginning. Seven years ago, in Xilong, Fujian, there was a multiple murder case. A family of five was killed. The parents, grandparents, and a girl. I want to go back. Go back? You want to fucking go back? You've ruined us all. Fuck! Fuck! You want to go back? You fucking ruined everything. That's enough. Fucking ruined. I want to go back. Feng, I... There's nobody to blame but yourself. In short, These three major crime perpetrators have been hiding for seven years. There's an old saying, "justice is blind." In seven years these three men have become legit. Time has shed their skins, and made them human. From afar, nobody can tell the difference. Are you okay? Fine. Here? Here. Where are you going? I haven't paid. Move... Blood... It's okay. Are you alright? Tie him up. Everyone, move away. What goes around, comes around. They hope to start anew. But we all know, it's not possible, Lift your leg. Password. It's... I'll do whatever you want. What did you do that for? Password. Give me a second. It's... 8 8... What's going on? I couldn't find any change. Why did you park like this? The road is slippery. Getting off here? Fine, I'll waive the fare. Just go. Go. Thanks. Thanks, officer. They are from my hometown. They never pay for the ride. Thanks. Drive slowly. Captain Yi, what's wrong? Let's go, I'll report directly for duty. But we wanted to hold a farewell party for you. We already made a reservation. Rain check. Thanks to the rain. I'd be screwed if it took longer. There's over 4000 cash. I was supposed to put in the bank, but I never had the chance. The bankbook's fine. That cop had piercing gaze. Did he get the plate number? Maybe. Not sure. It was raining heavily. Can I help you? Who's on duty today? Sergeant Zhang. Haven't seen him yet. Are you auxiliary officers? Yi Guchun. The new chief. You'll be working with me. All right, as you were. We'll catch up later. Where are you from? Xilong. That's where I was transferred from. Talk later. Damn, like a Hong Kong movie! Turning a blind eye. That's one way to go. It has to be like this. Princess Snow White. The Witch comes at last. It's Daddy Dao and Feng calling. Hi, Daddy. Chen is disinfecting the goldfish, When will you see me? I thought you liked the dorm. Why are you moving out? It should be here. We have a new chief. I don't feel right. Is the ground floor for rent? Only to good people. I've kicked out 42 tenants. They were all bad. We're good people. I want to make something clear. No bargain. Pay up front plus deposit. Sure. One year's rent plus a year's deposit. You know what? If I were an anxious man, I'd kick your ass. You could leave. Bread always falls on the buttered side. When two forces collide, things can never be the same. Now, lets get back to the story. Okay. You have yourself a deal. Turn it on when we get there. Okay. Why haven't you applied for civil service? How long have you been an auxiliary officer? Almost six years. What has been on your mind? I haven't thought of it. Hands above your head. Get out. Get out. Get out. Hands above your head. Down. Your head. Down. Freeze. Get down. Freeze. Don't move your hand. Down. Get your hands out of the bag. Get down. Hands above your head. Hands above your head. On the ground. Hands down. Feng. Yes? Stay down. Go. On the ground. You drew your gun just from a glance? Wouldn't you? You should take the civil service test. I'm not cut out for that. How could you know without trying? I just know. Auxiliary police is not a permanent job. I know it. I want to quit and find another job. I haven't talked to the sergeant yet. I won't let go. The cops are coming. Let's see. ﻿No resignation from you. ﻿At least not for a year. Really? Yi has nothing to do with our case. Will he be a threat? You have no idea, Dao. He is something else. He drew his gun from a glance. He's good. I have this bad feeling. So quit if you don't feel right. If you want to quit, Yi can't do anything about it. Right. The family called this afternoon. They like Tail, and want to adopt her sooner. Tomorrow morning, I'll take her to do a body check. Check on the dizziness as well. What's up? I need to run some errands. Like what? Pick up some goldfish. We have the operation tonight. Denied. What's in your hand? Nothing. Check below. Get up. Get up. Come here. Come here... Quickly. Come. What's up? Nothing. Picking up scrap metals. Where are your partners? Speak. Chief. Still fooling around? Come here. Come here. Freeze. Freeze. Freeze. Shit. Stop. Feng... Stop. Song, cuff him. Yes. Feng. Feng. Chief. Feng, chief, grab the pole. Move. Move. Hurry upstairs and shower. I'm fine, Take a shower. We'll go out and eat. Move. Is everyone out? Finished? Got their statements. 18 cases in 3 months. 700k in cash. These are pros. Where are you going? I need to pick up my goldfish. I'll be back for work in time. What's with these goldfish? Where are they? Jin Yuan Island. A hundred miles! Back to work, my ass. You drive. Get in. Move. There's an asparagus in Xilong. It's called Iusun, right? I thought the winter bamboo was good. But after I tasted Iusun, It beats winter bamboo. Hands down. The best kind is in Suan. I first tried it at my chief's home. His wife was from Suan. Got a bag of Iusun from their hometown. It's delicate. It gets chewy if you don't eat it fresh. Chief called up single guys like me. We had Iusun at his place. A great Iusun banquet. Delicious. The day after the banquet, There was a rape-and-murder case at Suan Reservoir. That was my first time with a big case. Chief took me to the crime scene. It was unforgettable. What I saw was carved into my mind till today. I couldn't let go, Didn't you see that dog crossing? What's with the panic? Cigarette. Bad habit. Haven't you heard about this case? I've heard. Family of five. The girl, her parents and grandparents. She was an art student. Went to do some nature sketches. Her grandparents came along. Their corpses were found decayed. Maggots crawling all over the place. Chief was an amazing detective. He figured the girl was the first victim. The suspects were up to something else. But they were attracted by the naked girl. The rape was spontaneous. She died suddenly. Autopsy showed it was heart attack. The suspects were brutal but smart. The parents' skulls were crushed. But not a single fingerprint was found. Their only mistake was the girl's necklace. Someone had touched it. Do you think it was a pro? Looks like it. People saw three young guys at the reservoir. One of them had a tattoo on his chest. An astronomy magazine was found by the victim's door. Some said the suspects were gay. But I think that's bullshit. Why? Would gay men rape a girl? So the case... It remained unsolved? My superior disagreed with his peers. The case was going nowhere. As cops, we believe in the word 'godsend'. I believe in fate. Heaven would give you another chance. Hello? Anyone in the car? I'm getting cigarettes. What's up? We'll talk later tonight. Something's up. Thief! Are you alright? You. Get in the car. Hurry. What do we do? He's got a knife. Watch out! Somebody! Help! Mugger! Who's the mugger? The one on the top and the bottom. Get some rope. Check your money. Blood... Go! So messed up. Hello? Brother! I caught two thieves. With the driver, who ran off. Could you look him up? What driver and thieves? Xia, I'm busy. We'll talk at home. Hello? Where's the fish? Dead. Dead? You didn't call ahead? What a freaking idiot. We drove for hours, for nothing. You seem smarter than that. Didn't you think to call first? Who was at the fishing hut? My friend, he works there as a guard. Why does he keep the goldfish? Who needs the fish? My daughter. You never mentioned her. She lives with my friend at the fishing hut. She can't live with me. She's his daughter too. The goldfish were her pets since 2 years. Whose daughter exactly? An orphan. She's an orphan. Still remember what the goldfish looked like? Sure. Tail named all of them. Turn left at the intersection. What happened to Calabash? That's not Calabash. It is, look. That one's Little Witch, this one's Snow White. No, it isn't. It is, look. The Suan Reservoir Murder Murder Mystery at Suan Reservoir Dao. Dao... Dao. Fuck... Dao... Dao... Dao... Dao... Fuck... Fuck... Hello? Tail fell. She's not talking. She peed, had a seizure. Is she dizzy again? Not dizzy. Seizure. Not talking. Not waking up. The doctor won't let me talk. You have to come. Stop yelling. I'm coming over. You have to come. Come now. Tail. Mister, you need DVD? I have the latest. Guy on girl. Mister. Two guys with three girls. Guy on guy. Mister... Fuck. Mister... Your intuition is right. About Tail... How much do you think Yi knows? The Tattoo. The magazine Chen discarded. And this. He noticed my habit of smearing fingerprints. Someone saw us at the reservoir. Can't be sure, if there's more. We can get away if we leave now. I'm checking out. We'll send Tail to that family ASAP. We'll leave Xiamen immediately. You got the body check report? We'll bring it. Feng. Feng. We need to let Tail go. I know. Cancel the account, withdraw all the money. Check-out. Yang Zidao. Don't wake her to change. Let her sleep. You think they'll treat her well? They like Tail very much. Will they spend money on her? Yes. They are quite well off. Would they spend a lot on her? Are you nuts? They are raising a child, not a money pit. Get in. Let's not do this, Dao. Xin Xiaofeng. Don't you dare get sentimental now! We're on the run, and you know it. I know. Stop talking shit then. Get in. Give me the child. Dao. Give her to me. Where are we going, Daddy Dao? Good girl. Go to sleep. Daddy Xiao... It's okay. Don't cry. It's alright. Don't cry. Daddy Xiao... Don't cry. Dao. It's okay. Don't cry. Daddy Xiao... Dao. Dao. What the fuck do you want? Sorry, I'm... Take a look. Take a look. What's that? Tail's medical record. The one I gave her new parents is fake. The doctor said without surgery, she won't last a year. Daddy Xiao... Why are you fighting? Dao, don't say a word. Don't say anything. Daddy Dao... Why are you fighting? It's fate. We have to get some money soon. I should have kept the money when that woman was robbed. I have never thought about saving money. All these years, I have never... Never expected there would be tomorrow. I'm tired. It's Yi. Hello? Chief. Hey, Oldie. Why are you here? Brother. Brother. It's the taxi driver I mentioned. The one chasing muggers. He's my brother. This is our chief. Hello. What a speedy recovery. Why did you get out so soon? Aren't you hurt? I am. Take a taxi back home. You come with me. Someone just jumped off a building. Go home. Get a taxi. I can't drive you. Brother. What? Let Dao give her a ride. Thanks. You're out working already? Do you need money that badly? Don't you want to live? Feng, be careful with Yi. He recognized me. Okay. Call me when you get there. Okay. Is he a cousin on your mother or father's side? Neither. We grew up together. And the one at the fishing hut? Him too. Three brothers. Interesting. You saved me. Your brother works for my brother. Admit it. You can never escape from me, Yeah. Why did he leave the hospital so soon? It's bad if the wound gets infected. He has to. He needs money. He's been working for two days. We were visiting our kid. She has a heart problem. Diagnosed as tetralogy of fallot. She needs surgery soon. They gave her an artery shunt. Pulmonary artery dissection. That costed us 40,000 yuan. She'll need another surgery. You stay here. Dao. The night I was robbed. You mean... He recognized me. He acted like he didn't. He checked you, then me. We don't have much time left, Feng. Talk to you tonight. I got customers. What are you doing? Who are you? You. Fuck. Don't fucking move. Don't move. Don't fucking move. Don't fucking move. Don't move. Give me your hand. Come on. Give me your hand. Come on. Your hand. Come on. Hurry. Come up first, alright? Come on up, Let's talk. That's insincere. It's not what you think. Let me ask you a question. Go ahead. You could have called first. All these coincidences could find him. Yi must be here to avenge that family. We can't wait until Tail's second surgery. We're not there yet. We're not destined to end like this. Our priority, is to raise money for Tail's surgery. When will the other shoe drops, we'll see. It's Tails bedtime. She'll worry if we are late. Let's go. Wait, let's clear part of the medical bill. It'll be New Year soon. The nurse has urged us repeatedly. I'll resume work tomorrow. Pay the bill. Hey, last round. Right. You asked me about the reservoir case. You may not know this detail. It seems the dead girl had a child. It's a rumor. The father was much older. But he's never been found. During my investigation, Nobody had seen that kid. Go home. It's late. You have a long drive. Tell me when you're sure. So I can have closure. I have this hunch. I know. Chief. The child would be 7 years old, right? At least. He's here to thank you personally. Officer Xin... Sorry to trouble you the other day. I just want to thank you in person. You're welcome. Have a seat. You too. I'll stand. I'm not an officer. Just auxiliary. All the same to me. I wonder if you are free tonight. A winery that I designed is nearby. I want to invite you for a drink. Officer Yi, please join us. I know nothing about red wine. Just hang out. I really... You saved my life. Give me a chance to show my gratitude. I can't today. Give me your phone number. When I'm free to visit, I'll call you. Well then. Alright. May I borrow a piece of paper, Officer Yi? Thanks. 1454 + 440 = 1894. Where's Tail? 1894 plus... Daddy Dao, I gave out balloons to everyone. Why are you here again? Tail. I asked her to come. Tail's so nice. Come and eat. Bijue, lunch. 3220 + 748. Eat. Come. 3968... Would you like to join us? No. The Chinese New Year Eve is in two days. Do you have plans for family dinner? 3220 + 748 = 3968. How about this? I'll ask the restaurant to deliver dinner to you. No. 3968... You don't have to yell. Give me twenty yuan. Why? Taxi fare. How did you come here? I told the driver a story. Thanks. Bye, Tail. Come back and see me. Bye. Bye. 4342 + 516 = 4858. 4342 + 516 = 4858. Is this Bed 408? Yes. Receipt. 4893 yuan. The girl just paid it off. 4858 + 35 = 4893 I haven't even ever talked to her. 4893 - 4893 = 0. Hello? Could you pick me up? Sure! Where are you? Here comes a taxi. Please stop. Taxi. Please stop. It's gone! Happy New Year, Oldie. Are you going? Why are you alone? Where is your family? They went home to watch TV. Why didn't you go with them? No seats left? Plenty of seats. I didn't want to. Patronizing my business? You only care about business. I wanna spend New Year's Eve with you. Happy New Year! Greetings to all! Hi, bridge. Oldie, let's turn around. Can you cross the bridge in ten seconds? The car has to fly then. How can I pay if anything happens to you? Pay with your life. Let's try. Are you ready? Turn around. Ready, go! Ten. Nine. Eight. Seven. Alright. That's it. Go back to your parents. I like you. Like this. Oldie. Alright. We'll hang out next time. Who is it? Food delivery. Buzz me in. That was quick. Police. Fuck you! Police. Gambling bust. Damn it! Hands behind your head. Freeze. Hands up and behind your head. Go. Do you know how big was the gambling pool? I know. Over 310k yuan. Wasn't it in the report? 312,600 yuan. A bit more, in fact. Drink up. What's bugging you? Nothing. I am really into law. It's the best thing ever invented by man. What makes a human? In my eyes, human is the combination of God and animal. We possess good beyond our imagination. And something too dark to fathom. There is no right or wrong to be human. The law can be so lovely. It doesn't care how good you can be. It only defines how evil you're allowed to be. Law is aware of the dirty secrets inside us. We can think, but we can't act. The law is the welfare system of humanity. It's forced discipline. It doesn't set a high standard like any religion. The law tells you honestly the least you need to do. It's very human but cruel. Fascinating, isn't it? I don't know what to say. I took the money. The pool should be 4500 more. I know you'd find out eventually. The police report is out. That's the final figure. I'll return the money when the time is right. I'll pay for it. Your salary is one fifth of mine though we share the same job hazard. I wouldn't tell you not to do it again. You don't have to follow me. You'll get it sooner or later. Dismissed. What's the hurry? Your house on fire? Feng. Move. Answer. Where is this from? Officer. Chief. Where's Feng? What's he up to? He's been elusive lately. He's been with that Taiwanese guy. Thanks. Working late? Writing a report for the bureau. I haven't seen you lately. I was sent to trim the trees. The sergeant wanted to trim every twig that hanged low. What's the hurry? Are you working on the money for that operation? No. Not that desperate. How much does it cost? Around 50k if things go well. There's around 10k in this account. I don't spend much. You take it first. No. I don't need it now. I will find a way. Take it. Not everything has an easy way out. I don't mean that incident. Are you gambling on soccer? No. Don't lie to me, Feng. Seriously, no. Good. Go now. Take the card. No. I'll let you know if I need it. Officer Yi. Follow that car. Don't lose it. Okay. Why did you bet on Inter-Milan? What's the big deal? What if we lose it all? 500k is no joke. Swipe it. Get in the game. It'll win. Swipe 50k with it. Sir. Who are you looking for? Sir, is there anything I can help with? Freeze. Police. Where are the two men? Which two men? The designer of this vineyard. The boss never lets us come here. Damn. When did you start to like it? When I was in high school. All three of you? It is your own business. Your own lifestyle. I... I can respect your... Preference. Preference. No pressure though. Work is work. It's the A-grade wanted list from the bureau. These two men look familiar. I've seen them. Gemini Building. Two Taiwanese. They didn't carry their IDs. Good. Stay alert. Hello? Chief, it's me. I got it wrong on the reservoir case. Wrong from the core. I'll tell you more next time. I just want to let you know that I give up. Sorry, Chief. It's fine. It happens. I know. Talk to you later. Does Yi still keep an eye on you? Not too much. Chopsticks. Feng... What's this? Eat your dinner. Who told you that? I told you. I saw it with my own eyes. Here? Let's make love, Oldie. Xia. Don't touch me. Hello? Pick me up at 10 am. Haven't you seen a girl before? I've hired you. You have to come. You're not. You're not gay. I want to know why can't you love me? Something must be wrong. I'm begging you. Tell me why. Tell me why. Just tell me why. End this for me. Okay. Listen carefully. You're forcing me... to give my life to you. Do you want it? Give it to me. What? Ask your brother. I've given it to you. Xia. What's wrong with you? What? Brother. They are gay. Crime scene photo You can't die. Hang in there, Fa. Hang in there. Hey, Dao. I'll wait for you at the foothill. Aren't you the ultimate weapon? Give me your hand. No resignation from you. She's an orphan. Found her at a church. She calls us daddy. All three of you? The are gay. Earlier that morning. Four men were seen naked in the reservoir, Doing funny business. We grew up together. Hello? Fuck! Dao. He is something else. He drew his gun from a glance. So quit if you don't feel right. If you want to quit, Yi can't do anything about it. If the other shoe has to drop, let it drop. Every year at this time, I will show them my true conscience. Yi knows about this. Mercury's retrograde... is caused by certain plane on the Earth... All these coincidences are with him. Certain angle with the Ecliptic... We don't have much time. Accidents happen with Mercury in retrograde. Yi is here to avenge that family. History returns for trouble. I can't let Tail go. Hello? I saw the two killers in Gemini Building. Chief? Okay. Wait for me there. How long has it been? 20 minutes. They exited the lobby when I saw them. This room. Hello? Room service. They'll be back soon. You guys guard the elevators and stairs. Song, you stay. I'll stay too. Hurry. Show me the pictures. Have you called the SWAT team? They'll be here soon. Block A... Shit. Zhao Call for an ambulance and back-up. Are you alright? I'm fine. Shit. Watch out. My gun. Come back. Get down. Freeze. Freeze. Don't move. Freeze. They'll go to the opposite building. We'll block them. Song, block this end. Yes. Be careful. Watch out. Watch out. Drop the gun. Drop it. Fuck. Freeze. Don't move. Get back. Don't move. Drop it. Freeze. Freeze. Freeze. Watch out. Feng. Feng. Hang on. Chief, hang on. Chief. Grab this, Chief. Song, go. Go. Feng, let go, Let them pass. Here they come. Feng, let go. Please. You should turn yourselves in. Let go. Let go. Fuck! Why pull a gun for checking your ID? Help me. Damn. Freeze. Drop your gun. Now. Is your landlord living upstairs? He has the downstairs bugged. Everything you said was recorded. It's on the table. The three of you. How come? I've thought about it. There's no such thing as good or bad people. Is this the place? Right. Go up there. Captain Yi. Wait. Give them a call. Feng. The other shoe dropped, Dao. Hello? May I have 20 minutes? I'll give you 30. Wait. Let us have a few words. I'm sorry, Feng. I have to do this. No need to apologize. Right and wrong. We all have then. I will let Xia bring Tail home. I'll take care of all the surgeries. Do you hate me? It's torture. In fact, we've been waiting for today. You wouldn't understand. Will you adopt Tail? If you agree to it. I beg you for a favor. Don't mention us to Tail again. Let her forget about us. The sooner the better. Please. Let's go. I'll take you. There's the surgery money for Tail. But not enough. Find her a nice orphanage. Promise me. Visit her often when you have time. No orphanage. I promise I'll never put her there. Come back. Xia. Come back. Xia. I'll pay for whatever the cost. It's not the money. I really love him. I know he isn't. But he did it for me. What isn't he? I asked him that day. Will you go on a date with me? I was trying to mock him. Do you dare? I promise you. I didn't expect he would really do it. I swear. Not at all. Not even that. I still don't understand. Why would he agree if he isn't? It's his first time. Such a pity. You could have been a great cop. Did you start in high school? No, you never were. Why would the Taiwanese park his car there every time? Because I can see that spot clearly from my office. To mislead me, you'd rather be gay. Being is safer than pretending, right? You've succeeded. All the calculation and courage. What a waste. Nothing in particular, Chief. We want to wait till Tail finishes her surgery. Then we can leave at peace. Calculation and courage, perhaps. But it was not for myself. Never. I guess this is farewell. Anything else? We... We're good fathers, I believe. Tail would often ask us. "Are you good daddies?" We'd always avoid her. Now, we could answer. "We're good daddies." Don't ask, Chief. It's better... to let this rot inside me. Fuck. Sir, preparation is done. Waiting for the execution order. Proceed. Yes. Proceed. Chief. Chief. What's wrong? The suspect for the cases in Shangxidi and Beipu. He's been arrested. He's also involved in other cases. All major ones. The guy knew how he would end up. He's confessed to everything. He claimed to be involved in the Suan Reservoir case. Except the girl dying of heart attack. The guy who lost money found me. If I got the money back for him, I he'd give me 20%. I agreed. Then, I went to Suan. I called Dao and let him know I arrived. Dao came to see me. He brought Feng and Bijue along. They came to hang out with Dao. We went to the villa. I searched around the house. I couldn't find any money. I went upstairs. I saw a naked girl lying on the floor. Crazy Feng had fucked her to death. He literally fucked her to death. The grandparents started yelling. I had no choice but to kill them. Who did it? I did. Then? We wanted to leave, but couldn't. We saw the wooden pole by the wall. I used it to finish them. Who did it? I did. They all chickened out. We went to the reservoir. I said, I didn't care who was helping whom. But they all needed to listen to me. They should do whatever I told them. Otherwise, my generosity would be wasted, If they disobeyed, they had it coming. They were scared to death. But they jumped on me. Those bastards were merciless. They thought they had killed me. Did you try to find them later? No. I thought it through. Don't you agree? It is a big deal killing the whole family. It's great that I stayed dead. Nobody would look for me, right? Feng and Dao had discussed it. Their statements matched. They both admitted the murder. But I still don't understand. Why did they want to die? The rumor. The orphan. What? There's a chance that Tail is not an orphan. Who is Tail? You heard a rumor that, the girl had a baby? That baby might have been in that house. It's possible. They saw the baby, but the suspect didn't. That house was well hidden. The baby would have died if she'd been left alone. So they returned to get the baby. I have to go back. They've been raising her. Then? The kid has been growing up. They know... They cannot hide it from her forever. If the kid learned the truth one day. It'd be the end of the world. All the nurturing and loving. The same people who let your family die. Who could endure it? As long as they were alive, it could have happened. Only their death could liberate the child. Could it be? They're murderers? You don't know, Chief. If so, Tail would be seven years old. Not five. Result. Bone age, 7.4 years old If the sentence were changed, it'd be also for Bijue. Perhaps he would recover? At least he could take care of Tail. It'd be a long shot. He's gone. We've been searching for days. We've asked everyone. We already reported it to the prison. They're also searching. When was he gone? Two weeks ago, I think. Perhaps he's not dumb. Perhaps he's living somewhere. I have an IQ of 163. If it happens, I could escape, I've really escaped. But I can't stand not seeing Tail, It's only been a few months, but I can't. I have to see her. I can't make it. Dao and Feng. Your stupid saying. You're both prophets. An IQ of 163 is not much better than 80 sometimes. Fine. I'm coming too. Let's leave her a carefree future. Vacation? What vacation? I'm baby-sitting at the beach. Tail, be careful. Tail. Alright. We'll talk later. Watch out for nails. -- Subtitles by AbK (subrip, resync, edit) --
