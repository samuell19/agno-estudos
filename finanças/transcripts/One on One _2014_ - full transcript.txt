A film by Ki Ki-duk. Shit. It's done, sir. Good. All right. Yeah? Okay. Good work. "ONE ON ONE." Cheers. How's your new job, baby? It's boring. How about you? I just do whatever I'm told. But what if it's something bad? I should still do it. The one who gives orders is at fault, not me. You'd be an accomplice. How am I an accomplice? I'm just doing what I'm told. People should stick to their values. So I should refuse? Know how hard it was to get in? It's my meal ticket. I should do as I'm told. Why you. So, what do you do? This and that. You never tell me. What kind of work is it? Trading. More details, please? Boring! Let's change topics. Aren't we dating? How come I don't know anything about you? Waiter! Are you okay? Yes, I'm fine. Wow! You're really fast! Oh, please. Watch it! Sorry, sir. Sorry? If I didn't catch it, it would've gotten all over her! -It's okay. -Please go. Sorry, sir. Stop it! I'd better go home. I love you. Call me when you get home. What the? Open up! You people out on training? Oh Hyun? Yes? Come out, fool! Come here, fool! Defeat communism! Defeat communism! I'll rectify it, sir! Ram your head! Yes, sir! Bastard! The world is at war and you're slacking off? I'll rectify it, sir! Snap to it! -Understood? -Yes, sir! Get up! Yes, sir! Sit down! Don't! Sit. Defeat communism! Oh Hyun? If you know my name you must know my job. You're making a big mistake. Who's in charge here? Remember May 9th of last year? This should help. Write down everything you did. Who are you people? If you don't wanna die, write it! If you lie, you're dead! Who's in charge? -We are! -Higher than you! There's no one higher! Write it! I can't. You bastard! How dare you! Hold him! Hold him! Hold him down! You wanna die? Hold him down! You shithead! Hold him down hard! -You fool! -Bastard! Dare try to fool me! Come here! You wanna mess with me? Okay. Just curious. Be honest. Why'd you do it? I just did what I was told. What? That's no excuse! Fool! It's the command giver's fault. When you get up high, you'll give orders, too! "I did what I was told." Will you say that then, too? Take what happened here to your grave. If you squeal, you'll die! Got it? Got it! Take him away. Yes, I'm home. I was sleeping. I'm going away on business. I'll be out of reach. I'll call when I get back. I love you, too. Good night. Over here! Joon! Like it? How may I help you? How's the necklace? Well, it's nice. What would you like? What are you waiting for in life? Pardon? What do you hope for? Well, what about you, sir? Me? Nothing. Life is so dull. I want to get abducted and get beaten to death. Really mean that? Bitter against the world? I'm kidding, boy! Who'd dare hit me? Get me a good wine and side dish. How about cheese? I'm a regular here, boy! Bring me the usual. Why do you keep calling me boy? So? You mad? If it's real, it's worth 200 million won. It's a fake, right? What are you doing? This is real. Have it. Cheese! Fools like him will never take it cause of pride. The hell? Wait! What are you doing! You fool! How could you! I'm sorry, sir. Learn to take it in, fool! Get a new one. I'm so sorry. What? He spat on the cheese? No way. Did he? Aren't you eating, dear? I've lost my appetite these days. You eat lots. You seem different these past several months. You look anxious and smoke too much. It's nothing. Don't worry. But I know you. Did something you hate, right? You hate doing things against your will. What happened? Nothing. Tell me! What were you forced to do? Tell me. I'll help you. I'll take care of it. Don't worry. Worrying's bad for the baby. Excuse me. What can I get you? More water, please. Enjoy your meal. I'm sorry, honey... But I gotta go. Don't worry. Bastard! Stay still! You bastard! Punch his lights out! -My turn! -Go ahead! Eat this, you shit! Hello, boss! Son of a bitch! -Quiet down. -Hello, boss! What's wrong with the late workout? Bring him. Get up. Get up, fool! You're Jung Yi-se? Who are you people? Bastard! Give me the file. Sit him up right! Look! Look familiar? You son of a bitch! Now, write down everything you did on last May 9th. Tell me who ordered this. Son of a bitch. No. Tie him up. Hey! Move! Will you write it or not? Son of a bitch! Won't write it? Bastard! Damn son of a bitch! You! Come here. What are you doing? Don't. Don't! Shit! Don't do it! Stop it! Stop it! What the hell! Do it right! Stop it! Fuck! Will you write it or not! I'll write it! Give me a smoke. Hey! What's wrong? Nothing. What's with her? Hey! Give me that. Should've wrote this in the first place, fool. Get your hand off! Did you do it too because you're ordered too? Didn't think it was wrong? Shameless bastard! And you laugh and eat out with your wife? You think you bastards won? Wait and see. Your hideous acts will all be revealed soon. Your baby's due soon? Aren't you ashamed? What? You're crying? Why're you crying? Think you did wrong? Looking back you regret it? Son of a bitch! You crying cuz you really feel guilty? I hope at least one of you bastards has a conscience, huh? Take him away. Get up, fool! You wanna ruin everything? Why didn't you do as told? I'm a girl. I never did that to a man! It fell like shit. You should've expected it. I did! But still, it feels like shit! Got a boyfriend? We agreed no personal questions. Right. So, you got one? He's a total bastard. I want to drag him here and torture him. I know fools like that well. The more you concede, the more they act up. Dictators aren't just for countries. There are ruthless dictators between family, friends, and lovers. Give up the sweets that you depend on him for. There isn't. Think carefully, there must be. Our reality's the same. We become enslaved by taking what they give. Being habituated, that's what's scary. I joined to punish them a bit. But it's become hard. I want out of this. No! Everyone stays till the end. If you leave, you'll end up just like them! So, don't get any ideas. You speak just like that bastard. Hi, So-yeon. It's Daddy. Be good and listen to Mommy. Put Mommy on. Honey. I'm so sorry. So sorry for everything. I'm sorry. Where were you? -Out for air. -With who? Alone. Alone? Don't fool me. Don't lock your phone! What are you hiding again? Unlock it! It's my phone! How is it your phone? I bought it for you. Unlock it before I kill you! Do it! Why you... Han Min-ju? Is this a man or a woman? A woman. Who is she? A friend. Where does she live? She died. She's dead? What did you do last night from 7 to 9 PM? -Watched a movie. -With who? You are driving me crazy. Who's the bastard! Tell me! Stop it! You crazy jerk! Who is it? Who'd you fool around with on my money! I didn't! I bought that bag. This costs millions? Luxury bags cost that much. Think I'm retarded? Call this a luxury bag! -I'm sorry! -I'm sorry! Where did you spend the money I gave you! I'm sorry! I lent it to a friend! She'll pay me back next month. Come here. Now. You really lent it? Yes. Such a nice girl. What will you live on? My payday is coming up. Stop working at the convenience store. Serving men all day. I'll give you money as always. You know how much I love you? You're all I've got. You can give money. Just not your heart. I can't take it anymore. Can't you let me go? Say that again, bitch! You wanna die? Wanna die together? No... If you say that again... I'll kill you. Come here. Like it? Yes. You're mine forever. If you ever leave me we'll die together! I'm sorry I hit you. It's because I love you. Crazy bitch. Do you really love me? Crazy bitch. Don't you know? Will you be good from now on? What did I ever do wrong? Want another beating! How much is a real one? About 200 million won? Probably 300 million. This is for food. You don't even thank me now? Thanks. No money or skills... What would you do without me? "Man shoots himself in car." Cheers! Congratulations, pal. Thanks. Such fast promotions. What's your secret? Just working hard, I guess. Shit! I do that, too! I do everything I'm told. You gotta do more than that. Figure out the job's key point. And? Do the work even without orders. And offer it up perfectly done. Right! I should... What if they order things you don't want? Then what? Do it! No matter what. Forget right or wrong or you can't succeed! The end result is what counts. Right. Who cares about that these days? Bad means or not, success is good! -Also! -What? If you're backed into a corner, you kneel and beg. Apologize immediately. I'll never do it again, sir! Isn't that stooping too low? Who cares? Just fake it. A total suck up. "Oh Hyun." What are you doing! Allegiance! Get in! Sit! You in charge here? Know who I am? Think you fools can get away with this? Remember last May 9th the horrible day? What? Write down everything you did then. How dare you! A mere cop telling me to do what? Grab him! What the hell! Put it up! What are you doing? What are you doing? Stop it! That's enough! Please stop... I'll write it. Write it good or you'll lose both hands. Why'd you come out? It's too brutal to watch. They're bastards! If we're not brutal, they won't fess up! Jung Yi-se killed himself. Saw it on the morning news. Handprint it! So? How do you feel now looking back? I'm so sorry. You mean it? Forgive me! What did you do wrong? Everything. You don't seem sincere! I was wrong. I'm so sorry. You're just trying to get out from a beating. I know fools like you well. Loyal as dogs, but gone when trouble strikes. Live right! Take him away. You stay. Take him away. Why'd you stop me? You were too violent. What? Those fools are violent! What are you doing? Want me to pound you? I hit it lightly and it kills. You're too emotional. Then, you can't do this. I'm not. It's human nature to feel pain. Anyone would become weak before violence. What do you do? I mooch off my big brother. Then, why take part in this? Cuz I'm mad I wasted my childhood. Studied like a robot? You can't speak Korean well. I even studied abroad on my brother's hard earned money. But that's all. I can't get a job. You are not the only one. And everybody is like fucking memorizing machine, you know. Well, now I am just a blood sucking miserable leech, that's spending all his money. And all his lagging and complaining makes me want to kill him. So that's why you joined us? To blow of your steam, huh? I thought it would be relieved, but beating other people doesn't solve anything. The further I go, the more I start pitying them. You're right. Pitiful. I mean, how much in life do they want to become such sneaky cowards. People become vicious. When they are greedy, you know. Especially these guys... I just cannot fucking forgive them. Why did you become so violent? That's good question. Why did I become so violent? I mean, you're a scary guy. But there's something sad about you. My future is gonna be sad. Leaders... don't have a long life. Did you know that Jung Yi-se committed suicide? He felt guilty, that's why he killed himself. No, we killed him. On whose fucking side are you? I don't know. If you are going far I might even report you. Okay, then I will have to kill you. -Honey! What happened? -Nothing. Are you hurt? I said it's nothing. No, it's not! What's wrong? Tell me. Don't ask anything. I need to get away for a while. Go where? Why? What's wrong? Please don't ask! Honey! Stop! Don't ask me! Honey! What's wrong? Stop asking! What's wrong? Byun Oh-go, Jin Ho-sung, Jung Yi-se, Oh Hyun. Where were you? Where did you go? I can take care of myself, bro. So, stop meddling. How dare you talk back! -What did you say, fool! -Honey! Stop it! Go on in. That fool! Since Dad died I worked hard to send you to college. I even sent you to study in the States for what? My friend's brother came back a professor! It's not about my money! At least get a job! You fool! If I studied that much, I'd work at Silicon Valley! What an embarrassment! When my friends brag about their brothers, I got nothing to say! I'm ashamed to meet them! Get a laboring job or something! Stop mooching off me! You bastard! Always on the computer! Like that pays anything! Think you can keep sucking my blood and inherit this later? I'm going to donate it all to society! I won't take a penny of yours! Don't worry! What did I do so wrong? I studied my entire life! I went to an Ivy League school! I graduated and for what? Nobody hires me! I don't know what to do! I'm a fucking cripple! Don't speak English! You're cursing me, aren't you! How dare you! So stop pressuring me! There's only so much I can take! I only studied like a robot with no rest my entire life! Fuck! Dare make a fist at me? Go ahead! Hit me! Honey! Stop! Go on in. Ungrateful bastard! Go out and croak for all I care! Go inside. I got something to say. Why do I have to work for two when I married one? Know how hard it is to cook and clean? Cook for yourself and do your own laundry! He's the only family you have. Your brother's not an investment! Stop acting like you lost money. Did you fund his education to brag? It's crazy how Korean parents force their kids to study. What do you think the kids will become? You're the same. Let him live his own life. He still has lots of time. Have some patience. He's smarter than you and is good at English. He'll find a job soon. What's this? Who are you fools! Let me out! Allegiance! Stop. Snap to it, fools! Yes, sir! -Stand straight! -Yes, sir! Did he really hit you? Yeah. Shut up, fool! Open up! Open it. Open up! What? Which base is this? Know who I am? Get him seated. What the hell... Last May 9th. Write down everything you did. We know everything. If you lie, you die! Why do you want to know? Huh? Begin. What's going on? Lights out! Son of a bitch! What's that? Bastard! Think I'm stupid! Lights out! I'll write it! I'll write the truth! I'll write it, I swear. -Do it right! -Yes... What do you think about what you wrote? Speak! The way it was done may be problematic, but I think it had a good purpose. Shameless bastard! Fine! That's your wrong belief. Did you work sincerely for this country? Isn't being loyal to the system good for the country? Not when you worked for a rotten one, fool! Shit. You just filled your stomach. What a cute daughter. Lay off my family! You bastard. You wanna die! Wanna live a happy life with your kids? -Huh? -Yes... Live quietly from now on. Don't act big and go crazy. Yes, sir. Remember to fear. Take him away. Go help him. You! Come here. What? Why'd you join in this? I thought it'd be fun, and it sounded good. You always smell like oil. Like car grease. You fix cars? No. Yeah, right. People are all the same. Half the world runs on laborers. Take pride. Try crawling under cars all day. See if that makes you proud. No matter what the job, don't stoop low. Those bastards are the ones who should be ashamed. Let's stick through to the end. So scary. No need to be scared. Educated big shots are weak to pain. After a few punches, they're nothing. Not those bastards, but you. I'm scary? They're the scary fools. Slighting laborers like you... They fuck with the world as they please! Why am I scary? So tiring! Good work guys. Who's next? Jin Ho-sung, the team chief. Isn't he dangerous? I'm kinda scared. What if we end up in jail? After giving them a scare the look on their faces, are no jokes. We're not kidding around. If we're clumsy, they'll catch on. Do it right! Isn't it about time we kill one of 'em? Shit! I'll do it! With this, hit here. Boom! And they're dead! Not there. It's here. Wait! Stop! Ready? Let's go. Why'd you hit me for real? That's the vital spot? -Hurry up. -Coming. Let's go! See ya! Bastards. It was all a show. Are you all right, sir? Who are you? It's me. What is it? Don't you wanna kill 'em? They got me, too. They're the ones who killed Yi-se! They're all fake, sir! They act like Special Forces! Cops, gangsters, agents! All disguises, sir! They abducted Chief Oh last night just like us. I followed them. They're just weak fools with big grudges. Cuz they're poor and unhappy! They threaten and hurt us to relieve their inferiority complex! Look, sir. They're nobodies dressing up in uniforms! They fucked with us! I was terrified at first, too. But when Yi-se died, I started snooping. Bastards! We have to get them! We should report them. We can't! Cuz they filmed us getting tortured? They're all fake. Nothing was recorded. Did you... Did you write it, too? Yes. So we can't report 'em. Then, let's get revenge! Pay them back for everything! Count me out. Why? I regret the way I lived. Are you serious? I was going crazy at first. I couldn't sleep. Made me shudder. But looking back at what I did. I lived wrong. Scared of retaliation? They're fake, sir! They're weak commoners! They're no match for us! We must get our confessions back! Why are they commoners? Why did Yi-se kill himself? Yi-se was an honest man. He struggled with it. He did it cuz he was ordered to... But repeatedly told me he couldn't do it. We only followed orders. Yi-se didn't die cuz he got tortured! He killed himself cuz of his conscience. No, sir! They killed him! Their beatings destroyed your judgment! You're just punishing yourself! They're terrorists, sir! We have to get them! Sir? Sir! It's me, Chief. Go away. Chief! Chief! Chief! Chief! Chief! Chief! It's Oh Hyun, sir! Come out! Those fools are fakes! We can get them! They're nothing, sir! Your friends in the prosecution can help us! Chief! Chief! How dare you! I'm sorry, boss. You lazy arse! You forgot to change the oil on the Korando. The owner was fuming! I was working on the Benz. When did you leave yesterday? Around 5 PM. I had to meet a friend. Brat! Think you can get paid for nothing! Go change the oil! Get to work, you stonehead! Coffee delivery! Come on in. Get to work, now! Have some coffee first. Forget him! Drink it while it's hot. Shoot. Look. He's a total brat. Stay away from him. I know. You're the only one for me. See you tonight. Okay. No! Why not! I'm dating someone. Who isn't! Anything but kissing! -Come on! -No kissing! -Hey! -I can't! Got no sense, fool! Let's go eat. -But the cups... -Forget 'em! That son of a witch! Hello? Working hard? Interested in lighters? No thanks. Just have a look. You can only get these in U.S. or Japan. How's this one? -No. I like this one. -This? Wow, you chose the best one! It's an American lighter. Nice, huh? -How much? -This is expensive. You can't afford this. How about this one for 50,000 won? How much is this! Are you slighting me? It's not that. I know how much you must make. This is too much. Why you... I'll give it to you for 40,000 won. This one's too expensive. How much? It's 500,000 won. 500,000 won? Take this for 40,000 won. I'll take it. Here! These are worth 500,000 won each. They're parts for really expensive cars. Two would be worth one million won. Take 'em to any other shop and you'll get 800,000 won. Okay then. What's wrong with this? Why aren't you working? Just came to get some parts. Darn witch just eats and goes. Hey! Where'd the two engine coils go? Didn't we use 'em on the Audi? We only have a BMW! Think I'm stupid? Fess up! They're worth your month's pay! I don't know, boss. What's this? It must be a customer's. Must've left it behind. It's a fake. It's yours, isn't it? Again? You gave the coils for this? You son of a witch! You stupid brat! You can't even tell from real or fake? You fool! Joon? Would you like to order? This is against the rules. So I wore sunglasses. You work here? Yes. There aren't any customers. Sit. -How's work? -Okay. How much do you make? I hate people meddling in my personal life. I'm not meddling. Just wanted to talk. What about parents? No comment. Got 'em, but don't care? I said, no comment! Unexplained anger is the scariest. Find the root of it. Did you find it, Chief? That's why I'm doing this. The world is seriously wrecked. That's why unexplained anger like yours is bubbling to blow. There aren't too many who wrecked it. Just a few bastards who keep wrecking it. We gotta destroy the seeds! That's what I'm doing. It won't work. You may end up dead first. I guess, if no one helps me. What can you do alone? Well, I'd better work. So, go. Okay then. See you at night. Come here fool! Defeat communism! Bastards! I'm Jin Ho-sung! Who's in charge here! Shut the fuck up! Defeat communism! Who are you? You're the one in charge? Don't you know me! You're Jin Ho-sung. How dare you call me by name! What agency are you from? Us? One that the President doesn't even know. One that will survive any government. There's no agency I don't know of! Isn't this the commie arresting agency? I'm not a spy! You're way worse! Know who this is? Last May 9th. Write down everything you did! What? You bastards! Cut the bullshit! Write down every bastard who plotted it! If you lie, you'll end up like this. Got it? Let me make a phone call. Electrical torture destroys the nerves. You can suffer for life. So, think! Will you write it or not? You bastard! I'll write it... I won't torture you. So, be honest. What do you think about your actions? You really won't hit me? Yes. Tell me. It was a justifiable act. I did it for everyone's good. For everyone's good? That's right. I did it cuz I was ordered to. But I believed it was the right thing! So... You'd do the same again? That's right. You evil bastard! You damn shit! Vicious son of a bitch! Chief! Let go! Seeds like you ruined the world! You evil bastard, worse than commies! You said you won't hit! Take him away! Get up, fool! You crazy? The hell are you doing? How dare you tell me what to do! What the hell are you doing? This isn't your revenge game! Why you! You're crazy! You bitch! Calm down! Don't get too excited. You heard what he said! For everyone's good! It could be from their point of view. People have their own values. Just like you! But you're also too much. Too much? Think of what that bastard did! Not me! I'm mad, too! That's why I'm in this! But I don't think this is right. Got any other ways to teach the fools a lesson? I don't know. But it doesn't feel right like at first. I pity them, too. That's not being sympathetic, but stupid! They use every mean necessary! Pity them and you lose like a fool. I'm no fool! Have patience, not to become like them! What patience! Listen up. It's the main game from now. Our next target is also an accomplice. We gotta scare him down good, or we'll end up in jail. If we get his confession, the top guy has no way out. Fine. But I'm kinda scared. What do we become next? How about gangsters? In nice suits! National Intelligence! That's cool! This is hard for me. -I want out. -No! What we do is meaningful. I told you I won't forgive traitors. What will you do? It's our free will! Try quitting! I'll show you what happens. How about a few drinks? Let's talk things through over a few drinks together. No! There are only two left. Once it's all over, we become strangers. Now, clear this place. What are you doing? Stop watering! There's no grass. Sit down, Mom. Have a tangerine. Not again! Just sit. There's nowhere to go! Sit down. Go inside and rest. Go in, Mom. That's good. Take a nap. Why won't you listen? How many times did I tell you to leave? What the hell is this? -So annoying. -Please. I'm sorry. Give me a few days. I'll get the money soon. A few more days won't solve this! We're tearing this down to build new apartments. What's all this? Sorry, we have nowhere else to go. Give me a few more days. What if an accident happens? That's your problem! If you don't leave now I'll bring in cranes and tear everything down! Got that? Shit. Young-min! What now? Open up! No! You'll hit me again! Just talk there. Give me my money back. I would if I had it. My wife took it and ran off to the States. What about this house? It's a rental. How could you! I know you faked a divorce and sneaked my money to the States! I'm begging you. I'm going crazy cuz of the bitch, too! I think she found another man. She won't even take my calls! Cut the bullshit! Give me just one hundred million won back! Let me live! Don't cause a scene! Just kill me why don't you! You lying crook! You call yourself a friend? Hey! Why you? What's your wife's address in the States? I'll get it myself! I don't know! Stop coming! Sue me if you want! Hey! You son of a bitch! Hey! You shitty con man! What? How dare you? Why? You fool! What's the meaning of this? Remember May 9th of last year? May 9th? Know who she is? Must be an unforgettable day for you. Write down everything you did that day. What did I do? You're an accomplice in murder! Fess up, now! I sacrificed for this country for 30 years. You're a corrupt soldier in a rotten ring! You've tainted the honor of real soldiers! If you are really agents, I demand to meet the director here! I know him well! What are you fools doing? You don't get it, do you? Begin! Stay still! What's this? What are you doing? Fools! Turn it on. You're inhaling very potent gas. Write it or spend the rest of your life hospitalized. More! More! Way more! More! Shit! Will you write it or not? Write it or not! -What's with you? -Move! -No! -I can't take it anymore! Don't do this. What are you doing? Stop it. This won't change the world. What the fuck! Keep writing. Who are you fools? You're not agents, are you? National Intelligence wouldn't do this to me! Whatever? Keep writing! I won't! Who are you? Who put you up to this? That's not important here! What matters is that you committed a crime! National Intelligence isn't sloppy looking like this! That gun is a fake. Son of a bitch! Wanna die? I dealt with guns my whole life. I can tell if it's alloy or aluminum! Think you can shoot me with this aluminum toy gun? Go ahead and try! Fuck! Who are you fools? Why do you want my confession? Oh you fools! Got grievances against the government? You fools are garbage that undermine society! No different than commies! Looks like you fools couldn't tell from crap and got caught up in this. Get him! If you wanna avoid prison, listen! I'll make sure you go free. Intelligence, police, prosecution, and the government! They're all my friends! Get him now! And release me! Promise to let us off? Yes. Fool! Don't fall for it! How dare you! Get him now! Shut up, you brat! Son of a gun! You're not worth that stars on your shoulder. This is fake! So what? Think it won't hurt? I bet it will! You jerk! It hurts, doesn't it! Any last words? You'll kill me with that fake gun? Shoot me! Are you sorry or not! I'm not! I'm a soldier who must follow orders! I have no regrets! Think this is fake? You fools are fakes! He's dead. He's really dead! How? He's really dead! He's dead? Why'd you kill him! Don't get excited. It's nothing compared to what he did. It's nothing? A man died! Freaking murderer. But... Why is your gun real when ours aren't? My gun was real from the start. What's your purpose? Think this will change the corrupt world? I feel worse! More miserable! You're the devil! I'm quitting this. Got complaints? Tell me! Don't give up or else we lose! There's only one left. It's cold. Come here. I'm fine. Come closer. Dang! It's so cold! We buried him good. No one will find him. I wanna quit, too. Killing a General means trouble. Who cares? We can do it. Let's go, Chief. Let's go. Ouch! The flames! Hey! We need to talk. I came to ask you. Let's see an end to this. I can't anymore. Kill me if you want! Allowing all the disrespect and violence, you disgust me. The more you bear it, the more they act up! You'll keep living like that? It's bearable. There are good things, too. Reporting me, huh? You're dangerous. I know. Report me. Go ahead. After this, I'm gonna kill myself anyway. Give me two more. Didn't you buy enough? Give 'em to me! Weird lady! Mr. Lee? Mr. Lee! Yes? Mr. Lee! One more week, please? Look, Mister. If I don't get paid, my boss will kill me! Just one week, please? Think we're a joke? See this? My boss beat me like hell cuz I didn't get your money before! So pay up, bastard! One week... Like hell! You freakin' crazy? Pay up now! He won't pay like that! Son of a gun! You brat! What's going on? Who are you? Son of a gun! Shoot! One more week! That's it! Are you okay? It's still okay. Eat it. The poor gets poorer and the rich gets richer. How'd you know I live here? Why'd you borrow money from them? My wife's in ICU. Is it cancer? She's on the respirator. They say there's no hope. I should decide soon. Betting hope on this crap! How sad. Why'd you come? Just passing. Want some? No. I don't eat cooked food. Eat up. Ramen noodles are weird. They're like staple food for the poor, but just snacks for the rich. Let's fight back the injustice. It's because I'm incompetent. No! There's a serious problem with the system we live in! Let's not give up. Help me to the end. I am thirsty. Could you spare some water? Save us, merciful Buddha. Wait! Excuse me? Are you Kim Young-min from Pohang Marine Corps? It is you! I'm Private Ma. Remember? Yes. You hit me a lot. Right... After military duty, I felt bad. It's late, but I'm sorry. I always wanted to find you and apologize. How did we meet like this? So cold! Hi, Chief! Get in! I came to say bye. It's not fun. I want out, too. Good luck. Anyone who wants out can go. We're all in! Let's go! It's the last day anyway. We won't see each other after this. Who are we abducting today? Byun Oh-go. That disgusting asshole. He's the brain who planned everything. I'm kind of scared. Don't be. We'll beat him like the others. What are we wearing today? No applause? Good evening. Who are you! Hey! What the hell is this? What are you cleaners doing? How dare you! I'm no garbage! Name your precincts! Call the one in charge! Now! I'm Byun Oh-go! Mess with me... And your whole family will die. So, untie me. Now! Why'd you kill her? No. I didn't kill her. The boys... They did it on their own! I didn't kill her! What? Shit! Don't kill me. I'll do whatever you want. Dear God! Lord, help me! Oh, Father! Help me! He'll die! Let go! If he dies, we'll be in shit! Let go, you bastard! That's enough! He says he's sorry! Bastard! Let go! Don't stop me! I waited for this day. Look at what he's done! Don't talk, look, or hear? Is that it? He should die miserably, too! You can't kill again! That's enough! He's sincerely apologizing! It's because of such leniency we ended up like this! He'll die! Stop it! Didn't you suffer enough? Stop compromising, forgetting, and laughing like idiots! Let go! Fine! But I quit! Me, too! I knew it. You're just like this bastard. If you don't stop now, we'll force you to! That's right! Try and stop me! I'm going to kill him! -Stop it! -Let go! Let go, bastard! What the... What's happening? Let go, you fuck! Let go! Uncuff me now! Done! Let me go! Fuck! Crazy bastards! We've done enough. Let's stop. I get it now. You deserve to get trampled on. You have no will to rise above it. You just wait for a big break to make it. If you make it up, you'd do the same as them! Don't treat us like them! We believe there's hope and are enduring it. Enduring what? When you lost your house to thieves! Fools! No matter how hard I try, it's no use alone. Why'd you bring us into this? You! Lured us with hateful comments on our posts! And we got sucked into this! You think that, too? That's right! At least we're better off than North Koreans! Shit. Why? Why didn't I realize earlier? People are so pitiful, right? You're pitiful! All human beings are so sad. Don't talk like you're God. Isn't life exhausting and hard? Like you're any different! I'm the same. If there are only loaches in a fish tank, they won't live long. If you throw in a snakehead fish, the loaches will run away become healthier, and live longer. That man... He threatens us, but he also makes us live. What makes us torture each other is the energy we live off of. Then, why didn't you just bear it! Because that's my role! Angry, hateful, and getting revenge! Then failing. I just made you a playground. A playground? Having fun dressing up and stuff. Wait. Looks like you have very different opinions. Doesn't mean we support you! Yes, I know. Listening to him. I see he's a smart but dangerous man. Everyone knows the truth. If everyone sticks by it, the world will end. Like he said. I just played the role of the snakehead fish. Thanks to you, it was painful. But I learned how I should play out my role. Your role is over now. Untie me. In my role! As a snakehead fish! Help me finish my part. I'm so confused! Let's talk outside. Where'd he go? What do we do now? Let's trust Byun Oh-go. He could be just saying that to get out of here. When he gets out, he can change completely! We have to choose carefully. He's Byun Oh-go! Helping him could be a big break for us. Trust me on this one. I'm so confused. Wait! Listen to me! Shut up! You traitor! Chief! Are you okay? I'll kill that bastard! Stop it! Why? Stop! Drop it. Just go back. No! I'll do it! Go back to your family. It's all over now. Go. Go now! Now, I think... Living could be hell. Your kids... Let them live well on your money and honor. That's my punishment for you. Who are you? I'm the one who did as you ordered. Then... You're under Jin Ho-sung? Yes. You stupid bastards! What the hell did you do to get me in this mess? When I get out, you fools are all dead. Hurry up and untie me! First, I have a question. You fool! Untie me first! It hurts! Why'd you order this? What the hell? How dare you! You wanna die? What reason, fool! Underlings do what they're told! Untie me now! Hey! What are you doing? For the last time, why did you do it! To live... That's right. I did it, so I could live. Or else I'd be killed by others. What about us who did as told? One killed himself out of guilt. The others have lost their souls. What about us! Why are you asking me? They're your problems. I'll give you a good job. So, untie me. What we did... who was it for? Who? Honestly? I don't know either. Then... -Your role is over. -What? What are you doing! "Who Am I?"
