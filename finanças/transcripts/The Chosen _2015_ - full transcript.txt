God, forgive me. Mom was right about you! You're insane! - You're my sister and I do love you! - What are you doing? What are you doing? No, don't do this. Only one more, baby. One more. Cameron, get up, I'm leaving soon. - Cameron, get up, now! - I'm up! Oh, great, oh, hi, you finally woke up, did you get enough sleep? - Morning to you too, Mom. - I've been planning this retreat for months, the least you could've done is gotten up early and helping out around here. - Calm down, Mom, what can I do? - Take over! Over here. Come here. What's up, Granddad? But, Grandma, I'm trying to help, he won't open his mouth. - I don't really care. - I don't want eggs. - Angie you love eggs. - Angie, eat it. What's up, turdburglars? My unemployment check is late. Oh, Joey, let me get my purse. I don't have time for this. - No, the mail-system sucks! - Beer for breakfast again? What a surprise. What about, "Hey, how's my favorite uncle?" "Good morning, Uncle Joey?" - Or, "hey, drop dead!" - Drop dead. - Fucking got to... - Ah, Jesus! - Jesus, Joey, take it. - Yeah, well, you're a dick. - You're a dick! - You guys stop, enough, take this. - You go over here. - You're such an asshole! Angie, go, go to your room and eat your food there, right now. You get away from me, you help me, right now, let's go. - Now, Cameron, I need help packing! - Oh, my God. Geez, why am I getting yelled at? Uncle Joey doesn't do anything around here. - What the hell is his problem? - Language, Cameron. I don't know why Nanny lets him live here. For the same reason she lets us live here, we're family. - You can't pick your family, honey. - Eliza! - One minute, Mom. - Eliza, I can't find my pills. Will you please help me finish packing? And get my sleeping bag from the cellar? Come here, I love you. Uncle Cameron, I have something to show you. Hi. When are we gonna see Mom, you promised. Shh! I told you, I'm working on it. Why doesn't Grandma like Mom? Hey, Grandma loves Mom. She just doesn't want you around her when she's sick. I made a painting for Mom. - Where is the baby going? - It's Jamie. I'm trying to grab his hand to stop him from going to heaven. Do you remember your twin brother? Only in pictures. Well, it's beautiful, and your mom's gonna love it. For the last time, I don't want Angie around her, move! Mom, she has the right to see her real mother. Actually, she doesn't, all right, the court has decided that when her mother overdosed, or did you forget your sister is an addict? - Did you forget you're an alcoholic? - Cameron. I've been sober for 12 years. Yeah, well, Mom, when you were getting sober you still had the right to see us. Cameron, I was drinking, Caitlin's a junkie! So those mistakes make her less fit to be a mom than you? Oh, that's it, move, this discussion is over. - Hey, someone's cranky. - Cameron. Listen, I pray for Caitlin, I do. But I lost one grandchild because of her, and I'm not gonna lose another, okay? - So that's it? - That's it. Listen, Uncle Joey said that he'd help with Angie, all right, so no fighting, promise? You trust douchebag Uncle Joey with Angie but not Caitlin? Stop in, and Aunt Jean is gonna come this weekend, check in, all right? - What am I, five? - No, you're not five, but Nanny would like to see her other daughter once in a while, okay? Besides, it'll give you the night off, okay? - You worry too much. - I worry too much? Come here, give me a hug, I'm an expert at it. I'll miss you, be good. Yeah, I won't burn down the house or kill anybody or anything, so. - I love you. - Sure. I love you too, Mom. - Angie? - Come find me, Uncle Cameron! Angie! - Hey, let me out! - Give me one good reason to let you out. Now, Uncle Cameron! Pretty soon you're gonna need a new hiding spot. When you go to college, who's gonna come find me here? Hmm... Looks like I'm not going to college. - Are you ready to go see Momma? - But Grandma said we can't go. Well, guess what. I'm in charge now, and I say it's okay. But if you say one word, though, lady. Go get your jacket. Okay. Where are you taking her? I'm taking her to the zoo. Don't come here no more, why do you keep calling? He is your son and you'll need to see him! You just want money, I ain't got no money. I don't want your dirty money. I know where you get your money. You have responsibilities... - Hi! - Mom! Oh... So tell me, how did you convince Mom to let you come here today? Well, Grandma doesn't know about this little adventure, so... - ...keep it a secret, right, Angie? - Mm-hmm. Oh, disobeying Mom, I approve. Well, she will kill me if she finds out, so. Not a peep. How you doing... you know? I'm good. Um, staying clean. Trying to stay on track and keep going to work. For you. - What's going on over there? - There's been awful fights all week. - It's just been terrible. - Did you call the cops? In this neighborhood, there's really no point. Around here, it's better to mind your own business. Uncle Cameron, don't go! Hey! Hey, what the fuck are you doing? - Get off of me. - No! - Get her away, man! - You're letting him get away. What the hell are you doing here? He was the last one! - What's going on here? - I'm here to help you, calm down, calm down! - I'm gonna call the cops. - What happened, just tell me what happened. I'm here to help! - Are you bleeding? - Stupido! - Who was that guy? - This is all your fault. All right, slow down, slow down. Tell me exactly what happened. - I can't believe you let him get away. - What's your name? She's coming, she's coming, I have to save my baby. - My sister is calling the cops. - I have to save my baby. - What are you doing here? - We're here to help! Let me help you! Tell me what happened. Calm down! No, no! - Angie! - No, don't, don't! Angie, Angie, Angie! My baby! No, he's gone! No, no! Angie? - What's wrong with her? - She'll be okay. What about the baby, was there not a baby? Listen, let's let the cops deal with this one. I called Dr. Mendez, he said he can come by the house in about an hour. What if she caught whatever that baby had? You better get outta here. - Just call me, okay? - As soon as I figure things out. All right, take her. Come on, baby. Bye, guys. Eliza! Jesus, Nanny, oh, my God. Where's your mother? Nanny, she went on a retreat. You know that. Let me help you. Are you comfy? Oh, not the comforter, it's too hot. - If you need anything else... - I want a good night kiss from Angie. She's sick, she's already in bed. Oh... Poor thing. She's so sweet. Hand me my book, honey. - Good night, Nanny. - Take care of Angie, Cam. You really just need to chill, it's probably just a little cold or something. Yeah, and you weren't there, I'm telling you. Don't be so dramatic. You sound like your mom. Hmm. Shoot me now, please, oh... I swear, I heard something coming up, like from under the bed. - Like weird breathing. - Oh, weird breathing? Yeah. - That's not funny. - It's funny. - No, it's not. - It's kinda funny. That's what you get for smoking this. Where did you get this stuff anyway? From my Uncle Joey's stash. Creepy Uncle Joey? No wonder it tastes so cheap. You know, this is kinda creepy to do with your sister and Angie watching. So, have you given it any more thought to going to college with me after summer? I've been a bit preoccupied around here. God, you're making excuses again. - Look, I told you I'd think about it. - This is our future, Cameron. - I know, Megan. - You graduated a year ago. You wanna end up like your uncle, or your mom? Come on, how long are you gonna wait to start your own life? Hey. Do you like it? - Angie, Angie! - What, Cam, what the hell? Jesus! Angie. Oh, you know you need to be in bed. I'm not doing this right now. Angie, come on. Get out of there! Oh, my God. Angie. I'm telling you, Caitlin. Something isn't right. You should've seen the look in Angie's eyes. Do you have any idea how insane that sounds? I mean, seriously, you probably just smoked something that you shouldn't have. Okay, can we talk about your hallucinations later please? Angie's gonna be just fine. The doctor said that I just need you to watch her, okay? Love you. See you later, let yourself out. I know you're in there. - Go away. - Come on. I gotta talk to you. Please. It's my niece. - I have nothing to say to you. - No, help me, please. Listen, whatever the reason is you hate me, don't take it out on my niece. She's just a little girl. All you need to know, is in here. - Who are these people? - They were chosen, so that a child could be saved. Their deaths were wasted, they always are. She dares you to try, but she knows. You will fail. Who are you talking about? She's the child-stealer, her name is Lilith. She was Adam's first wife. What do you mean, Adam and Eve, Adam? Banished from the Garden of Eden after refusing subservience to Adam, as God commanded, Lilith was punished. Her mouth was sealed. Her womb was cursed. She would never bear children. Lilith became a creature of darkness, making a pact with Lucifer to grant her unholy powers to steal the offspring of Adam and Eve. ...children for her. So what are you telling me is that Lilith has Angie? No, not yet. - There's still time to save her. - I should go. The cost of a soul, Angie's soul comes at a price. - Obviously you've been through of a lot... - Sacrifice, it's the only way. You need to offer six other lives to Lilith in little Angie's place, six lives from her bloodline, from your family. What do you want me to do? Are you expecting me to kill them? No. You... mark them. Lilith does the taking. You have six days to mark six members of the blood line. And if you fail, Angie will be gone. - Where is your baby? - I almost saved him. And then you showed up. - You let my ex-husband escape. - Okay. - He would've been the last. - Okay, okay. - I wish you were dead, and not my boy. - But this is fucked up. But I can't stand the thought of that little girl going through the same thing. I spent three days trying to understand this. I wasted time on doctors, PIs, paranormal experts. Everything I could think of to save my baby. Three of my six days, and now he is gone. You don't have time. - You need help. - I'm not the one who needs help right now. If I were to choose six people... - how would I choose 'em? - The first one is unbearable. And then it gets harder. Cameron! Oh, my sweet Angie. Nanny's here. Cameron. Nanny? Nanny? Nanny? Grandpa? Grandpa? Grandpa? Are you okay? Are you okay? What? Grandpa? Say it, say it. Jesus, Nanny! Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. I'm sorry, Nanny. Hello? Yeah, Mom, I'm here. No, no, no. No, Angie has just run into fever. It's nothing too serious. Yes, Mom, I called Dr. Mendez. She's in bed already. She took her pill. Okay, thank you, Mom, thank you. I gotta go. Okay, so what does this book mean? And where is Nanny, Cameron? Why won't you believe me? You need to trust me on this one. Okay, so, Lilith is a demon and you sacrificed Nanny to her? Although that bitch probably deserves it, I mean, come on, Cameron. - I'm not lying, Caitlin. - Okay. Caitlin? Caitlin? Caitlin? Caitlin! Holy shit! - Caitlin, it won't open! What the fuck! - Hey! Hey! I need a drink. Caitlin, that's not gonna fix anything. What we need is five more people, and we only have four days to go. - And what are you gonna do? - Well, I can't do this alone. Okay, well, how do we choose? - It has to be from our bloodline. - Well, who's gonna be next? Boo! Like a little girl! Pussy! That was awesome! What are you doing, dumbass? Uh, I'm grabbing this aspirin for Angie. Yeah. Whatever, man, just take it. Oh, Cameron. I just want you to know, uh, I hope Angie's okay. I checked on her earlier, she didn't look too good. You checked on her? Yeah, man. Yeah, I do care, okay? It's kinda hard to tell. I mean, we are family, right? Yeah, yeah. I guess we are. Yeah, we are. - Did you check on Nanny? - Aunt Jean has picked her up. - Without dad? - Well, yeah, they just went to dinner, so. She said she'd be back soon. Ah, whatever. - Shut the door for me, will you? - Yeah. Caitlin. It's done. We just have to wait a bit. Oh, shit. Hey, beautiful. Meg. - Where did you come from? - I missed you. Oh, I miss you, too. Why are you sleeping? I'm so tired. It's been such a long week. But you don't have time to sleep. Hey, hey, Cam, Cam, wake up! Hey, it's time. Come on. Caitlin, his arm, his arm. - So how do we do this? - You don't need to stay here for this. No, I... - I need to see this. - Caitlin, I'm gonna take care of this. Go! Damn. What the fuck... What the... Huh? Where are you going? What happened? - I'm sorry, I couldn't. - Hold still. He was just lying there, and he just woke up. - You still had time to make the symbol. - He was awake, Caitlin. We don't have time to wait for natural causes, I don't know what you don't understand about that. I don't see you volunteering to cut your finger - and eternally damn your family members. - I'm not gonna lose Angie, Cam. Since when do you care about Angie? Or didn't you think I would notice? - I'm gonna go. - Caitlin, don't run away from this. Caitlin! Wait, I forgot, it's not your fault. But you know what, it is. Okay, you have a daughter who loves and adores you. When Angie needs you the most, you're walking out. You know maybe Mom was right. Maybe you don't deserve Angie. Hey! You know what, maybe I'm a fuck-up, okay? But you are the one that brought this thing on Angie. You are the one who put her life in danger. You are the one who's gonna take care of it. Hey, Megan. - You're pregnant? - That's your reaction? It's been a fucked-up week. I'm sorry to inconvenience you, but we have some decisions here. - I can't do this right now, Megan. - What can be more important than this? Look, I know you don't wanna sacrifice your life for a kid. - Megan, you told me you were on the pill. - I am. It doesn't always work. Cam, we have to make a choice. It's life and death. It's not an easy choice. Yeah, well. I wanna keep it. I can't do this right now. I just need some time. Fine. You know, take all the time you want, it's not like we're on the clock. Jesus, Cam. You're good? All righty. You missed a button right here. You're looking sharp today, Grandpa. Granddad, you must be wondering where Nanny is. You know, I miss you, Grandpa. I really wish you were here to help me. What? - Can I help you? - No. But I can help you, Cameron. May I come in? Lilith... she's here. What do you know about Lilith? She took my little girl. A long time ago. Well, did you... Sacrifice anyone, no. I went through six days of hell not knowing. I had a way, a chance. Lilith was haunting me, mocking me, the whole time. That's what she does. She took Rebeca. Then I became a nun. - How did you find us? - The book. The book Sabrina gave you, I wrote it. I've been tracking her for years. Helping anyone I can. Trying to find a way to banish the unholy beast back to hell. Have you managed to offer her anyone? My nanny. My grandmother. She fell. So she was pretty much already dying when I found her. You got lucky. Or maybe you do have some stones after all. But three days down, you're gonna have to push harder. A nun is encouraging me to kill my own family? All of us are marked by years. By bad habits. Mediocre deaths and the ease of it come into our petty lives. But the children. They are Tabula Rasa. An empty slate. Greatness can be written there. There's no worse sin than letting a pure soul be a servant to that slut in hell. That still makes me a killer. - Aunt Jean, Randy. - Hi. - Hi. - I thought you guys were coming tomorrow. Hosting a women's luncheon, last minute, now tomorrow, so... as promised to your mother, I'm checking in. Is this a bad time? No, no, well, maybe a little bit. Where's your grandmother, upstairs? - She's out. - Out? Where did she go? The doctors. Yeah, they said she was gonna be a while, so I just came back home. Not gonna ask about my brother, but what about little Angie? She's sick and she's in bed. Oh, I hope I don't catch whatever it is she has. It's just the cold. - I am so susceptible to colds. - True. Well, I guess we'll just wait here until it's time to go pick your grandmother up, and then we'll get her with you. - Would you guys like something to drink? - A drink would be nice. Orange juice, some warm milk? Well, I don't suppose Eliza keeps alcohol in the house anymore. Uncle Joey has beer. - Shocking. - Whatever. Be right back. So how hard does it blow to live here? It's got this kinda like antique shithole vibe about it. If your mom would've married into money like mine did, you might better off, but my mom's a total milf, so. I don't wanna think of Aunt Jean like that. Oh, come on, your mom is totally doable. In that born-again Christian kinda way. - That is fucked up. - Yeah, it is. So must be tough getting laid living in your grandma's house. Well, I have a girlfriend, so, not really. You're straight? Hmm. Pfft, so what happened to your finger? I was... I was cutting up XTC. I was at a party. You know, and the razor slipped. What a noob. Have any extra, I'll buy it off you. - Yeah, give me a minute. - Nice! Sweet! - Cameron. - I'm in Angie's room. Hide your drugs in Angie's room? That's genius. I'll call you back. Randy? Cameron? Get up here. Look, man, it's nothing personal. Okay, well, you are a douche, but... it's just so convenient you came with Aunt Jean. You know, opportunity's knock and whatnot, so. Fuck. - Wait... - What the fuck's happening? Wait. Guys! Guys? If you jump out at me and scare me I will pepper spray both of you. Guys? Hi, pops. I swear to God, guys, one more time and I'm gonna kill you. Jesus Christ, Cameron! Are you trying to give me a heart attack? Ma. Ma. Ma! Cameron, stop! Randy. Help! - Hey. - Aunt Jean's dead. - Caitlin, I can't do this alone. - You're not alone, you're not. Randy's tied up in the cellar. W... what? It didn't work. She didn't take him. I should start figuring out how to do Uncle Joey. Don't do anything else, all right, just wait until I get there. I gotta meet with my parole officer, though, real quick, so let me do that, and I... and then I'll come. All right? You're tired, Gramps, aren't you? You'll be with Nanny. You'll be happier. Jesus, what am I doing. You're doing what's necessary to save Angie. Your guilt is the only thing that's stopping you from saving her! He'll understand, you know. This shitty life he has is no life at all. - I... I can't. - You have to. That's easy for you to say. You don't have to choose six people over one little girl. Don't ever tell me what I would or would not do to save my Rebeca. Lilith is a devil's whore! And you're a fool. A fool who's squandering the only chance you're ever gonna get. There is no good option here. Even God knows what you have to do. Your life is as you know it is over. There's no going back. So snap out of it, grow some balls and do what you have to do. Look... I know he's old. And sick, and he probably doesn't have much time left, but... he's still a good ma... a good man. Wake up. Don't bother screaming, nobody's here. Here, I bought you this, it's a protein shake. Drink up. - Fuck you. - Drink. Look, man. What you saw upstairs was a demon taking your mom. And I know you won't be able to understand this, but, I had to do it to save Angie. No, man, I totally understand. If you let me go I can help. Sorry, I can't do that. Come on, Cam, I'm getting dizzy over here, I feel fuzzy, I think I need to see a doctor. Well, I can't. People are gonna come looking for me, you crazy fuck! All right, and my mom, she's important, she's got stuff going on like every minute. You don't think people are gonna notice? You never shut up, do you? Angie, Angie, you're up? Angie. Angie, what are you doing? Angie. Angie, Angie. Oh, my God, oh... Are you okay? Come on, come on, come on. Oh, I didn't know you were home. How is she doing? - Better. - Good. - Can I go see her? - You know, I just put her to bed, so, you probably shouldn't just wake her up. Okay. I'll go check on Grandpa. I didn't think you cared. Well, that much I mean. Well, with your mom and granny out of town, he's probably pretty lonely. Well, Nanny will be back from Aunt Jean's tomorrow. That's funny, I called Aunt Jean. Nothing. You know Aunt Jean. Yeah, she's a wasp-y bitch, isn't she? - Are you good? - Ah, bet gone bad. - Looks like it. - Yeah. It helped me put things in perspective, though. You know, I care about you, right, Cam? You're family, it means something. - I just wanted you to know that. - Yeah. - Grandma Mollie? - Yes. This is insane, we can't just page through our family photo albums and figure out who should die. Okay, well, that's exactly what we're doing. - And what about Granddad? - Okay, look... Granddad is gonna be a natural choice. But he has to go after Uncle Joey. Or else Uncle Joey is gonna be way too suspicious, and I'm running out of excuses on why people aren't around anymore. I really don't think you need to worry about Uncle Joey, I don't think he's gonna notice or care. That's the thing. I don't know what's been going on lately... but he's a lot more... I don't know, like human than before. Which is kinda messed up because... it sure would be a lot easier if I still thought he was a useless asshole. Okay, so... we choose douchebag Uncle Joey, and Granddad, that's four though. Make a suggestion, okay, that's exactly what we're doing, we judge, and then we get to pick who lives and who dies to save Angie. What about Dad? He has a new life, and new children, and shit. Okay, yeah, Dad's already on the list, but he's out of town, and I don't have time to track him down. Okay, what about his kids? They're blood related to Angie. Caitlin, I'm not... I'm not killing kids. There's no way. Then who are the last two, Cameron? I think we got a problem. Holy shit, Randy? What the hell, man? He thinks that Angie is gonna be taken by some demon. He killed Mom. He tried to kill me. - What the hell are you talking about? - Get me out! Ca... Cameron... Randy! Hey! Hey, asshole! - What happened? - Stay back! What did you do? Oh, my God! Why? You cocksucker! Cameron! - Stop! - Cameron! You're gonna die! Come here, cocksucker! I'm gonna kill you! Cameron! Oh, my God! Shit! Come here! - Cameron! - Over here, dumbass! Cameron! Cameron! Cameron? Answer me! Cameron! Cameron! Hey! - Over here, Caitlin. - Are you okay? - Let me go! - Shut up! We can't just leave him tied up down here. - Okay, well, we are until this is all over. - He almost got away already. I deserved that. Cameron, I have a really big problem with this. Caitlin, I'm doing what I have to do to save your daughter. So shut up! Cameron, honey, I'm home! - Shut up, just shut up. - Hello? - Shit. - Where is everybody, Mom? Hello? Joey? Great. - Mom. - Hey. - You're home early. - Wait, what is this. You're bleeding! - I'm fine. - No, you're not fine. - No, come here! Come here! - What are you doing, let me go! Cameron, what? Honey, what's the matter? What's wrong? If you had to choose between Angie and Caitlin, one of 'em had to die, who would you choose? - What kind of question is that? - Mom, answer me. Caitlin. Hi. Hi. Is there something wrong with Angie? This sounds crazy, Cameron. I don't understand any of this. What's going on? Where's Nanny? Where's Uncle Joey? What have you been doing? What's happening. Mom, listen to me. There's no time! I made some awful choices, but it's because I had to. - This is all to save Angie. - Wait, what choices are you talking about? What have you done? Save Angie from what, Cameron? - Come here. Come on! - Ow, Cameron, Cameron, let go of me! If you think none of this is true, and I'm crazy, there should be no problem with Grandad seeing Angie, right? - What is he doing? What've you been doing? - Calm down, calm down. What are you doing? Stop it! Cameron, what are you doing? Stop it! - What have you done? Oh, my God! - Angie needs you, hold her! No! Let go of me! What are you doing? - Calm down! - Let go of me, no! Stop! Save her! Daddy! The devil has come to this house. This is my fault. I knew that I'd be called to the gates of hell one day for what I did. What are you talking about? When the twins were born Jamie came out with all those problems, he was so sick. If he had lived, it would've been a life of... illness and hospitals. Mom. He went so peacefully. What did you do to Jamie? I took his frail life away with these evil hands. - You killed my baby? - Oh, my God Caitlin, I'm so sorry. Get away from me. Get away from me! For three years you've had Angie because I was called an unfit mother. You don't understand, you were getting so high when you were pregnant, and... And you kicked me out of my home, and you wouldn't call me, you took my children, and you killed my Jamie! You... you know, you say that you love God and you preach all this bullshit, but you're just a murderer, you self-righteous bitch! I made the wrong choice, I'm so sorry. That wasn't your choice to make. - Caitlin, I'm sorry. Caitlin! - No. Wild cats and hyenas will meet there, and billy goats called to each other, Lilith the night monster will lurk there and find herself a place to rest. Oh, Angie! Angie, stop! Angie, no! Nanny gave this to me. I want you to have it. Caitlin. I know there's no way you're ever gonna forgive me, and I, Lord knows there's nothing I can do to make it right, but... there's something I can do for Angie. Mom. There's one more thing. What? - Randy's tied up in the cellar. - What, why? I tried the symbol on him, it didn't work. Cam, baby, Randy's adopted. Oh, shit, stay here. Oh, shit! Guys, guys, we gotta go. We gotta go right now. You promise me you'll finish what you started, okay? - Promise! - I promise, Mom. I love you so much, Cameron. I want you to know I always loved you. Take care of Angie. Okay, I'm ready, I'm ready. Oh, God. Oh, my... We have our last sacrifice. - Hi, Caitlin. - Hey. - Come in. - Where's Cameron? Over here. Oh, my God, Angie. Cam, what happened to you? - I need something from you. - What's going on? You were right. I wanna be a good father. And I don't wanna keep this baby. - What are you doing? - Shh, it's okay. Cam, you're scare... what, Caitlin? What the fuck, guys? - Sit down, just sit down. - Cameron, get her off of me! - Do it! - What the hell is going on? - Let me go! - Hold still! Caitlin, get off of me! Let me go, please let me go! - What the fuck is happening? - This isn't my baby, is it? Come on, honey, - let's just talk about it, okay? - Shut up, okay? Shut the fuck up. - Just tell me what's going on. - Shut the fuck up! How long have you been fucking someone on the side, Megan? Alright, that's it, get out of here. Go. Get out of here. - You guys are crazy. - You have no idea what you've done. I promised Mom we'd finish this. We are finishing this. - So maybe you... - Should do the same? She is your daughter! But you know what? You were never her mother. I am her mother. You're a murderer. Well, maybe you should take some responsibility. She deserves better! Oh, I can take care of Angie better than any murderer! - You can't even take care of yourself. - What are you gonna do for her, huh? You're gonna be put away, what are you gonna do for her? They'll find her a decent home. One with a mom who isn't shooting up. No, we might as well just let her get taken then. Because I'm not leaving her with you. Baby, come here. What makes you think... that you deserve to live and she deserves to die? I'm still here, and I have a right to fight for my life. Then fight for it! Mommy? Angie? Honey? - Are you okay? - I don't feel good, Mommy. This is the police! - Open up! - Here, come over here. Help me draw the symbol on myself. There is no time, come over here. Help me draw the symbol on myself. Promise me, promise me, that when they come you blame it all on me, tell him it was all my fault, I just went crazy, and you don't know where I went, tell them I made you do this. Tell me, promise me, Caitlin. I promise. This is the police, what's going on in there? Thank you. Caitlin, Caitlin, go! Leave her alone! Let's go to hell, bitch! No! Angie! - Mommy! - Oh, my God. It's gonna be okay. Okay, okay. Come on, Angie, we gotta get going, the movers are gonna be here any second. Ready to go, sweetie? Let's go, huh? Come on. Synchro: Peterlin
