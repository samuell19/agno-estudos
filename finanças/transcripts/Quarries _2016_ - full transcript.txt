[wind blowing] [birds chirping] [whooshing] Looking at myself, getting my angles and stuff. What are you doing? I'm taking mad selfies, bro, taking mad selfies. I think you've got a problem. I've never seen someone take so many selfies before. Dude, have you ever seen my following before? It is insane. - No, I haven't. I have... well, it's not insane. I have a huge gay following. It is. I want to make them happy so... Is that why you're wearing the pink pants? - Coral pants. - Coral? Coral pants. Yeah, whatever you say, man. Look, uh, you could be taking dick pictures for all I care. Just, uh, make sure you're tagging the trees. Dude, I am tagging the shit out of these trees. Look. Look. Nice. - Both sides? - Yeah. - Really? - I haven't been. I completely forgot. It was just one of these things. I... I tagged... You begged me to come out here. I completely forgot. I know. It's only two simple jobs. Yeah, they were not... they weren't all that simple. Tag the trees and check the GPS? And I've been doing that all the time, I swear to god. Let me see here. I mean, dude, constantly... Let me see that, man. Sorry. We've only got three miles left to the site, anyways. Let's just keep moving before it gets dark. Sure. Dude. This looks like a good a landmark as any. Tagged, bro. Dude, I am so tired. Dude, imagine living out here. It's beautiful, right? No, it sucks ass. I hate it. I hate this place. What is the most fucked up place you've ever shot? Abandoned subway station in New York, the place just felt like it was coming down on top of you. And there was a ton of homeless people in there, stirring shit around. - Homeless people? Dude, I hate homeless people. You probably don't even know how to shit in the woods, do you? I have no idea how to shit in the woods. I've never been here before. All right. [beeping] [gunshot] [gasping] [whispering] [stabbing] [gurgling] [crows squawking] [screaming] [music playing] MAN (ON RADIO): On the north side of the canyon... MAN: Nervous? MAN (ON RADIO): the smoke is just smothering the mountains there. It's like a, uh... MAN: Jesus, I hope this doesn't impact the trip. MAN (ON RADIO): a really bad version of the air we saw in the Sacramento... KAT: Can you turn that off? MAN: Did you break in your boots? KAT: Yeah, I'll be fine. MAN: You're gonna get blisters if you didn't. KAT: I know. MAN: Just... just tell them you were late because of me. Tell them we got a flat. KAT: No, I'm not gonna lie. Just can't stand that fresh air, can you? Relax. It'll be my last one for a while. What if they turn you away for being late? They won't. They won't. Well, um, you'll come stay with me and Bridget when you get back. Thank you. But you've got to promise me one thing. You don't ever talk to that piece of shit, ever again. You cut him out, for good. I know. OK. This is gonna make you regret smoking all those butts. I got it. It's all right. It's all right. Jesus. You want me to hang around for a minute? No. It's, uh... I'll be fine. I'll be fine. It's gonna be OK. I think this is gonna be really good for you, Kat. I love you. Just take some time. [music playing] [engine starting] [sighing] Fucking thing. MAN (ON TV): This is a very aggressive fire. What's so striking to me... and I've been through over quite a few fires this summer... uh, is how expansive the... The burning areas are. It's not like one concentrated area. It is really spread out up and down the canyon. Uh, we could see some spotting going on. How can they call this a touch screen? Do you want new school, or old school? Old school. Tough, you're gonna get both. All right, just put a pin in the GPS. Hello. Solar charger will take it from there, OK? You know I have no idea what that means, right? That's encouraging. Um, what's the verdict? Uh, the closure has put us about 100 miles off course. WOMAN (ON TV): It has now grown to 15 square miles. It's threatening about 2,500 structures and forced one local school district to cancel classes. A forest fire broke out late last night... So we go north. Yeah, or we could postpone. The checks have been cashed, and schedules have been cleared. And we have those permits. So I was thinking that, um, if you drop us right around here, then we can travel around these ridges, which will put us up on the trail, and end up at our destination here. You OK going somewhere you haven't gone before? Yeah. Yeah, I mean, we'll get to our destination. And we won't compromise too many miles. Um, I guess, just let the others know then because they're gonna love surprises. We don't have a choice, do we? Right. [knocking] I'll get that. Found our sixth member. Hi. I'm, um, I'm Kat. Yeah, I know who you are. You're late. Is there a reason? Yeah, my... my brother drove me. We ended up getting this flat tire. Then there was no cell phone service. Which tire? The left one... The front, left one. Right, and he left, your brother? Mhm. So now I'm... I'm stuck with you. I'm really sorry. Right. Let's meet everyone else. So basically, uh, everyone else has been staying down at the lower cabin. We leave in about 10 minutes. Uh, is there any chance I could get a shower in? Doubtful, we've spent the last two days learning to get to know each other and how to survive in the wilderness. So you, my friend, are going to have your work cut out for you for the next few days. Um, you do realize that your toes are going to be in hiking boots for the next two weeks, right? Yeah, I know. OK, this is Katharine. Hi. Hi. You can just call me Kat. Hey, do we have any bags or containers or anything? I made breakfast for everyone. Wait. We made breakfast. Is there butter? It's not my fault that the toaster is ancient. I thought I told you not to look at the setting. Well, I... whatever. Hey, guys, ladies, ladies, this is Katherine. She's new to the group. Be nice. - Hi. - Hi. - How you doing? - OK. - Cool, yeah. - We have to hurry up. Now that she's here, we're gonna have to leave soon. Well, I will. I had to shower. Yeah, you had to shower. Oh, where did you find that? Closet. You know you cannot take that with you, right? Yeah, but what if I run into, like, a fucking bear or something? Well, you definitely wouldn't use that. I think I could. Um, we're leaving. When? Now, soon, pack your shit. And, uh, don't forget to take the sheets off the bed, OK? Who's the punching bag? Wren, seriously. Hi. Bags are already by the van because I'm that good. You're awesome. Joy, Joy, Joy, hey. Can I talk to you for a minute? Sure. Wren went through my shit again. How do you know it was Wren? JOY: I mean, she... she rearranged everything, but she didn't take anything. - Uh-huh. Are you gonna do something about it? OK, how about this? Why don't you just be the bigger person? Breathe in, good. We have to go. Who's that? Kat. Hey. Hi. Joy, Katherine, Katherine, Joy. All right, people, five minutes, I suggest if you want to take a shower, that you do so ASAP. OK. Um, can you tell me where the bathroom is? That way. [music playing] [groaning] [knocking] I'll be right out. Jesus. Hi. Boots, Brit, boots. I know. I know, two minutes. Nice toes. Uh, listen up, guys. We have an update. Yeah, so the fire is, uh, still burning, and it's crossing our path. So the backup plan is about 250 miles north of here. 250 miles? I mean, we were supposed to leave in an hour. And now we're leaving in five hours? I mean, come on. So she controls the weather now? Listen. I just want to get what I paid for. Yeah, your parents' money. Ooh. Hey, guys, that's enough. You guys are here for an experience, not a vacation. Wren? I would also like to point out the fact that she did not go through the wilderness training, and I'm a bit concerned. That was cleared through me due to car trouble. All right? Any other questions? Good, no. Load 'em up. Wren, no. Come on. Get in the van. Let's go. Let's go. Thank you. You're a terrible liar, so don't make me do it again. What... what are you... what are you... I was just waiting to see if Katherine wanted the window seat. Or do you want to... Very sweet, very considerate. JEAN: We can escape the distractions of our lives and learn to live in the moment. I started this program to offer an approach that promotes physical, mental, and emotional well-being. Forming strong relationships with nature, one's self, family, community, and each other, these are the things that create profound change. The wilderness is not a luxury, but a necessity. The first time I went on one of these trips, I was 13. I was given a choice. I could go voluntarily or involuntarily. I came out of those woods a different person. Chapman has this quote. "The jungle is neutral." It builds on what you bring in. If you're weak, it will break you. Now get your packs on, and let's go. Please, just remember the GPS and lie to me and tell me that you fully understand how it works. I fully understand how it works. Perfect. Bye. Bye. All right, ladies, see you on the other side. See ya. Nice. Thanks. Hey, guys, check this out. Wow, this is so cool. What is that? 30 aught 6. 30 ought what? It's the range of caliber. And how do you know that? Because I've been shot before. Well, congratulations, your highness. Do you know what happens when you get shot? No, I don't. The round crushes everything in its path, sending shock waves through your whole body. And your bones? They splinter. And it rips through your insides like hot razors. Ow. What? Vicodin or Percocet? Uh, neither. [music playing] JEAN: Come on, guys. Let's go. Keep it up. That looks so dope. Gotta go this way, though. One step, take it one step at a time. I don't need your help. Come on, guys. Let's go. Guys, you go over there. Well, she won't help me. Keep it up. Go ahead. Hold on for stability, less chance of a slip. Wren. I've got you in the back. Go get 'em, son. Joy, let's, uh, let's park it up here for a few minutes, OK, guys? - All right. Take a five-minute break. God. I'm just saying, it's a lot of walking. JEAN: Get some water. Make sure you guys are staying hydrated, please. Brit, phones don't work out here. How, uh, how are you holding up? I'm all right. Are those new boots? Uh, yep. You're gonna get a lot of blisters. It's gonna hurt like hell. I can handle it. OK. You let me know if you need moleskin. How's she doing? Why don't you ask her yourself? Her face. Yeah, I know. Now are we gonna keep this direction? Mhm. Right now, we're heading, what, north about 30 degrees, northeast? I'll catch up with you, uh, in three miles. Seems like we might make six miles on the day. Joy, come on. We're gonna stick together. Yeah, well, I come out here to get a peace of mind, and I'm keeping my distance from Wren. Is this gonna continue to be a problem? Not for me. All right, you guys. Let's go... packs on, hydrated, phones away. [music playing] [horn honking] [motor shutting down] Hello? Hello? Hello? Seriously? [gasping] That's mine. Hey, Chris. Yeah? Put it in the garage. Shut the door. Hey, where's the fuel at? About half a tank. Drain it. [gasping] Holy hell. [laughter] How are the marshmallows? Hmm? Oh, would you like one? Sure. I will make you one. No, uh... Check this out. Shh. Uh, so how long have you guys been together? Um, two years. Wow, that's a long time. Congrats. Thank you. And how did you meet, where? She was my yoga instructor. Oh. Of course, of course, you do yoga. Good for you guys. Oh, thank you. Oh. Hey. Hey. Are you gonna get in there? I'm just kind of taking it all in right now. Husband or boyfriend? [owl hooting] Boyfriend. Is it done? Mhm. You know what I used to say when people would ask me? What? Everything is a mistake until it becomes a lesson. You OK? Yeah. Yeah? Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine. It's nothing. What is it? I just... Oh. How we met and Wren and... No, I shouldn't have said anything. I'm sorry. She makes comments about everyone. I know. But why did you have to tell her how we met? Because that just gives her fuel, you know? You're right. I shouldn't have said anything. I'm sorry. - It's OK. It's not your fault. When we were doing my tent earlier, I noticed that you have a tattoo on your... On your wrist. It's pretty cool. Thanks. I have always wanted to get a tattoo. But I haven't really been able to decide what to get. Is your... is your tattoo commemorating something? Yeah, it's, uh, my brother's birthday. Really? Mhm. That's so nice. That's totally the sort of thing I would do. But, like, that's... that's that's really loving. You must care about him. Yeah, I do, a lot. That's really special. Mhm. Um, what does... what does your brother do? Uh, he doesn't do anything. He's dead. Oh, god. I'm really sorry. It's OK. It's not your fault. It was mine. - I'm sure it wasn't your fault. - Yeah, it was. MAN (ON PHONE): It's me. I know I'm the last person that you want to hear from right now. But I just had to call you and let you know that I'm so sorry, babe. I started looking up those meetings like you asked me to. And I promise you, when you come back, I'll start going to them. Call me. I want to know where you are. [overlapping voicemails] Just fucking call me back. If they'd have just stayed out of our fucking business... It's driving me insane. I just want you to come home. Answer my fucking phone call now! You know I would never hurt you intentionally. Heavenly father, guide us from the hindrances and snares of executing your judgement so that we may dwell safely in your manifestation. Amen. - Amen. - Let him go. Go on, boy. Go on, boy. [music playing] JEAN: Hey. JOY: Hey. Look what I found. Wow. So much for the middle of nowhere, huh? Jean, can we go check it out? No, let's leave it alone. We'll go this way. You want to give me a piggyback? Hell, no. [laughter] I don't know why you have to ignore me. Can you please not do this right now? I didn't start it. Neither did I. Oh, my god. Hey, guys, remember, like, 45 minutes ago when you two weren't fighting? That was awesome. Can everyone shut the fuck up, please? - Thank you. - You do this. You accuse me of something where we can't talk about it. And then I have to sit with it. I... I didn't. You did. OK, you know what? Why can't you just admit it? Oh, I went for a walk this morning by myself. That doesn't mean I want to get away from you. Oh, so everything is about me, right? I think that's what she said. Sorry. - Oh, my god. - Excuse me. Excuse me. - Oh, my god. I can't. - Coming through. All right, so listen. Guys, listen up. We're approaching a ravine. It's going to be a steep, steep downhill climb. I want you to go slowly, carefully. If you need to stop, you need to take a breath, do it, all right? Oh, my god. Oh. It's OK. Come on. Come on. There you go, Jean. There you go. - Right here? Yeah. JEAN: Guys, stay up there. - No, no, no, no. - Fuck. - Don't... - Take my hand, Jean. All right, I can't put it back into place. I just need you to breathe, OK? Breathe. Got it? Are you guys OK? Squeeze my hand. Squeeze my hand. Breathe. I'm moving your arm. Relax. There you go. [groaning] There, there, it's OK. You're all right. [groaning in pain] See? Better. [groaning in pain] You want to try standing her up? - Ready? - Yeah. Standing up, one, two, three. OK, we're bringing her up, girls. All right, let's get this sweatshirt off of her. All right, guys, she can't carry anything right now. We can split her equipment up and carry everything. Yeah. Jean, are you all right? I will be, yeah. What do you think we should do? Do... do you want to just go back? Well, what about that clearing back there? It doesn't seem like anybody's home. Yeah, that's true. Yeah, guys, let's, um, let's divvy that stuff up. And we'll... we'll head back there for the night, OK? - Mhm. - All right, I got her. All right, ready? One, two, three. All right, I'm gonna grab my backpack. I'll get everyone started. You just take it easy. Come on, guys. Let's go over this way. Those look good. Right there. Where should I go? Brit, you're over there. Over here? Mhm. You done this before? Twice, yeah. How is it feeling? Like it's on fire. I feel like last time, it went through the, uh... Should we read the directions? No. I just want it to connect. There you are. Thanks. Here are the stakes. Yeah, I got this. You just need to let it rest. The muscles around the joints need to relax. And you know all of this how? I... I was a paramedic. I'll be right back. [sighing] Hey. What? What? I'm sorry. We just need to relax. It's... Yeah, it's... you're talking about me. I know. I'm trying. I just... I'm trying. That's why we're here. I know. Hey. Have you guys seen Wren anywhere? - No. - Hmm-mm. Wren? [ominous music playing] I need to know what you're taking. Vicodin? Jean is in a lot of pain. Is there any way you can spare one? 750s? You can cut them in half if they're too much for you. That's not the point. How many do you have left? I don't know. A few. Enough to last the whole trip? I don't know. Mind your own fucking business. You can't have withdrawals out here. That's why I'm asking. It will be on us to take care of you. What do you know about it? Hm? Not a goddamn thing. You don't. And you can tell Jean if you want. I don't fucking care. [spooky music playing] Yes, thanks. I should thank you. Yeah. [shouting] - Hey. - Hey. What's that? Uh, it's a GPS. No, what... what's this? That's a solar battery. Does it charge cell phones? Mm. [laughter] Yeah, I wouldn't know. My phone is out of power. Can I give it a... Give it a whirl? - You know what? - Yeah? Go crazy. Thanks. Ah! [gurgling] And, um, I... I've been meaning to say, thank you for your support... [gunshot] [gasping] [screaming] Put one, there. Make 'em scatter. [screaming] - Come on. [gunshot] [screams] [gunshot] Come on. Oh, my... oh, my god. [gunshot] [scream] Shit. Shut the fuck up, OK? Shut up. [gunshot] What the fuck? [gunshot] Hey, Chris. Stupid ass. Come on, guys. OK. We're going. [whimpering] Sh. Hey, don't worry. Yours is coming. What the fuck? OK, let me try and go. We'll go. - No. OK. [screaming] Get the fuck off me, girl! Yeah! Yeah! I'm gonna fuck you dead. [screaming] Yeah! No! [screaming] Come on. Come on. Come on. This way, it's this way. [music playing] How many? How many? [screaming in pain] How many were with you? [sobbing] Here, help me. Can we get down? Brit. I'm not fucking go down there, no fucking way. There's got to be another way. No, that's fucking impossible. We have to climb down this? We have to. No fucking way. It's a shame. She could have had a purpose. [gunshot] [gunshot] Go. Go. No. No. [sobbing] Zeb, hand me a knife. What the fuck? Make this right. Make this right. Go on. [grunting] Bow your heads, boys. We commit those who have died, beseeching you to receive their souls, oh, Lord. Let's go. Climb, climb. Wait. I need my hand. I need my hand. - OK, OK, OK, OK. Oh, my god, I can't. We've got to go back. Go back? Go fucking back? Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Oh, fuck. - OK. - Are you OK? Uh-huh. Oh, shit. [screaming] Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Fuck. Oh, my god. [sobbing] We've got to go, you guys. We've got to fucking go. The battery is fucking dead. Is it broken? I don't know, fuck. Take it. We'll go. Go. Come on. Come on. What are you doing? We can't just leave her here. - We have to leave her. Come on. - Say it tomorrow. Come on, guys. Come on. Wren. Wren, come on. Go. - Wren, come on. - I got her. Come on, Wren. Let's go. [panting] You all right? Yeah, I'm OK. What is it? What is it? Is there anything in there? What's in there? Open it. You guys, grab it. I'm fine. We've got to go, guys. - Come on. - Grab whatever you can. Guys, there's nothing there. Let's go. - Just grab whatever you can. - There's something. There's a pipe. - Guys, you guys, come on. Let's go. Come on. OK. [crickets chirping] [owl hooting] What? Did you hear that? Are you holding up? Not really. You? [inaudible] Why is this happening? We didn't do anything. They shot Jean. They shot her. That's crazy. It's crazy. It's ins... It's unimportant. Where do you think we are? I know where we are. We took a detour, and we went straight into someone's fucking backyard, right where we don't belong. That's where we are. They'll keep coming. They won't stop. We have to assume that. Yeah. Do you guys think Joy is dead? [crying] [music playing] [whooshing] Shh, shh. You let me fall asleep? Yeah, it's OK, though. I couldn't fucking sleep if I tried. It's gonna be OK. No, it's not. Yes. It's my fucking fault. It's my fucking fault. What's going on? I'm just trying to see if this shit actually works. I'm not going to spend another night out here. Did you hold it up? Yeah, I mean, it's in the sun as much as possible. Oh, oh, oh. Thank god. OK, it looks like if we go north here, we'll hit this area. Yeah, but what is that? I don't know. Come on. It could be a town. Great. Yeah, but what if it's just another fucking field or something? Do you have another fucking idea? No. OK, let's just be safe. We'll just... OK, guys, what else are we gonna do? [music playing] Are we stopping? I just have to take my coat off. I don't know. So give me the phone, OK. Just... you need to hold this. Hold that. Here, hold this. So hold that up. Yeah, hold that up, fine. Madison, Madison, Madison! [screaming] [screaming] [screaming] Hey. Hey. How are you? How is it? It's fine. We'll just...
