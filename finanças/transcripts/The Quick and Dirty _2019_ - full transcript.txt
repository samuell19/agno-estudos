I think someone's coming. Huh? There's only 300 people in this town, they're all at home watching Carson. Do you want me to leave my boots on? Yeah, yeah I do. These boots are made for... Hey, this is some ride. You've got some major perks. You have to unhook it from the back. Oh, yeah. Ow, oh... That's it. You must get a slice of the pie. I'm just the driver, I drop off and I pick up. I do what they tell me to. Yeah, I'm gonna tell you to do a few things in a... Oh, yeah. What are you gonna tell me to do? Yeah so, how much? How much is in that bag? - I don't know. Why do you wanna know so bad? I don't know. Did you mean what you said? About? You know, about me being... Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you're inequaled. Look me in the eyes and say that. I can't baby. Not right now. - Why? Wait, cramp, cramp, cramp, cramp, cramp, hold on. Okay, just breathe. - Okay, yeah okay, here we go, hey there, there it is. There it is. - There it is. Okay, okay, let's get back on that horse baby. Kick them boots. You're inequaled. Go get 'em boy. He cut to the left, stop! This way, he's over here. Down the slope! Over there. Okay, they got him, they got a scent. This way! C'mon we're losing him. He's definitely zigzagging. Which way? - We're losing him! - Why'd the dogs stop? - They got something. They smell something. Settle down goddammit. - Which way, which way? - Hey, to the right. Hands, lets see em'! Now! Shit. - Okay they got the scent. - The dogs picked him up again! - He jumped. Damn, okay let's go fish 'em out. - Hey stop! Help! - We got a deal? Shit! Phil! - Hey Mary, you know those things are gonna kill ya, don't ya? - I'm counting on it. - Bobby, now you know I've always had a taste for the high life. I think it's time I started living it so why don't you get me something off that top shelf. - Pay your tab, and I'll get the ladder. - Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, once again I must comment on your poor attitude. Now there's gonna come a time in the not too distant future when I decide who shall and shall not be rewarded and you my friend you're sitting on the precedence. - Precipice. - Yeah, and you're on it, Robert. My retirement is intimate. - Imminent. - Yeah, who? Yeah, he's here. This ain't your office. - Give me the phone. Who loves you baby? We got a big problem you and me he got away. - No, no, this is not our problem. I did my job, I called the guy, I sent him the package and I convinced him! All you had to do is was collar him, that's it. He lost his gun and he dropped his clothes to throw off my dogs. - So he's out there running around in his skivvies and you can't find him. What did you say to him? - I just followed the script. Did you mention his friend? - I mentioned him. Yeah, Nickel, Nickel Ride Mike or Mick or whatever. Yeah, I did my part. You're in deep shit if we can't find him. I need to know everything you said to each other. - Yeah, yeah, well if you don't get this cleaned up before the city finds out about it and comes down here it is going to be tragic. Tragic for you, asshole! - Piss off! No, not you. Look, he was supposed to call me here and then we're gonna meet up at the motel. You set up a meeting spot? - Obviously, it was never meant to get that far. You think he'll head there? - Well if you don't chase him out of town, it might still have to go that way. ♪ She was fine ♪ ♪ It was good ♪ ♪ He was in ♪ Look, I gotta go. Stay tuned. ♪ It was hot, they loved sin ♪ Is Mills okay? Yeah, but Bondy's pissed he got away. Bondy's always pissed. Hand me that, I'll take it to Bondy. And what entrance did he come in? You got here fast, with dogs. Photos. - One of my girls call you? - Must've. How much did he get away with? Chief. - Let me see. This evidence has... - Size 12, big dude. There's piss on that. - All right, log it. - His gun is still under my desk, if you wanna get prints. - He was wearing gloves. - Keep it, souvenir. All right, let's wrap it up. - You're done, that's it? - Sir. - We've covered this place. Plus I got a lead he's headed to the motel. Chief Bondy! - What? - He didn't have a bag with him at the quarry. - Get me the... - Megaphone! - All right, we're looking for... - A brown duffel bag. - We're looking for a brown duffel bag between here and the quarry. Half of you make your way down there. - No! Stay out of this. First and last warning. But Karl... Listen Karl, this is serious. I gotta get that money back. - What I need, is information. This is normally when I would ask you how much and you'd pull some bullshit tiny figure out of your ass. But that brand new Cadillac back there tells me otherwise. - 200K. - And I'd say, why so much lettuce on hand? And you'd say... - The migrant workers get paid monthly and they send most of it back home. They don't have bank... - Bank accounts. And then I'd say, are you cleaning money for the city? And you'd say, what? No! And it'd be at that precise moment that I'd smack you across the face with my open hand so as not to leave a mark. Once you composed yourself you'd open up, telling me they forced you to do it. Now that we're all past that Walter. Why didn't you bring me in? - What do you mean? - Just because I'm wearing a clown hat doesn't mean I'm part of the circus. I served as one of Chicago's finest for over 20 years and you wouldn't be in this mess with me at your side from the get-go. You need real protection. The bag will turn up. We got his ride, stolen two counties over. He's on foot, no gun, headed for the motel. I'll get 'em. And I'll get back what's left of the money. What's left? - There's always a little something off the top Walter and your friends in the city will never know how fragile you really are. Now we'll make a formal arrangement later. But the trailer's gotta be black, to match my truck. What is this? - Why would I chase scumbags the rest of my life when I could be chasing the horizon? Screw you Phil! - Yes you did! I thanked you for that. - I opened up to you. I was in. I was all in Phil. - That was just a flirtation. I'm sorry hon. Phil Pucksley is kinda like a lone gun just pickin' off the prairie dogs. You'll get what's coming to you Phil! ♪ That you are taking me down ♪ ♪ And I'm tired of the shit ♪ ♪ I'm tired of the shit ♪ Move over. - What do you want? What do you want? - Automatic? What? You're in over your head. My brother's gonna hunt you down. You've got his car, you've got his money, and you've got me, that's three strikes! Don't touch me. Get your hands off me! My brother will find you! Oh fuck! Grant Page? - Think you got the wrong number. Wait, wait, wait, we have a mutual friend, Nickel Ride Mike. - How do you know Mike? We played chess in the pen. - What's he up to these days? What? You delivered his eulogy, you tell me. Come on man, I sent you a package, photos, maps, everything. Did you get it? This guy's never gonna see it coming and he's screwing over the little guy. Isn't that what you're into, some sort of Robin Hood thing? I'm in the middle of something. I'm sure you've got bigger fish to fry but this, this one's really simple, 200K, 50/50. Are you there? Okay, okay, 60/40 but you gotta move on this right away. Come one, quick and dirty! Okay, so here it is. She arrives at 5:30 sharp just before they close up shop at the greenhouse. How do you know all this? - You got a real nice ride. You got a good thing going. - You gotta untie it from the back. Oh yeah. The drop off broad likes to go for a drink or three after she makes a delivery. She's my in, but she'd not involved. You can't make a move until she's back on the road. But from the moment she makes the drop you got a 10 minute window before the bag's locked up and you're moving while he's doing the count. He's got one heavy at the door, second office on the left. - And you're sure it's dirty money. Hey this guys hands are filthy and so is where our money came from. Did you catch that? Our money, you just gotta pick up his laundry. It's that easy. You in? - Man you're making a big mistake. Can I help you officers? There he goes! Get back here. - Stop! Halt! Police! He lost his gun! Freeze! Well, well, well, you all right down there? Let the dogs go! Watch out. Let 'em run. In the tunnel! Open this fucking gate! I'm giving you a gift here. You just gotta pick up his laundry. It's that's easy. You in? It's that easy. Drop the bag! - Mills, where is he? - Get out of the way! - He's in here, cut him off! - He went down that row. - Go to the left! - Check that row to your left! Fan out. I'll go this way, you go that way. Come towards the south entrance! Cover the doors! Which way, which way? - Up there! - There he goes! - Get back here! - Cut him off! Fuck! - Hey Bobby, any calls when I was uh... ♪ For the truth, he got burned ♪ ♪ He came back ♪ ♪ He came back ♪ - It is Phil, right? - Yeah. - You seemed surprised, to see me. - How did you get her... - Her coat. Picked it up on the highway, hope you don't mind. - I thought you were... - Call you. - Well, this isn't really the place to meet. - It isn't, dressed like this. - Especially when you're dressed... - I'm sorry. You don't seem comfortable. Is this making you uncomfortable? Let me take care of that. Bit of an improvement. - We still gotta go to the motel, right? To.. to split the cash. - You're right. Let's do that. - Yeah. But.. You wouldn't mind if we had a little drink first. I'm thirsty. What are you having? - Whatever you're having. - Two more Bobby. - Took you long enough. I was stuck here for almost an hour. I was 94 miles away. I arrived in 64 minutes. If you'd stayed in school long enough like mother had asked, you'd realize I averaged 27 miles beyond the legal limit to get here. Now should I assume this little caper was not part of your plan. - Of course not. Hold this. Well aren't you gonna ask me how I am? I was just kidnapped. - How are you? Fuck you. - Who did you confide in? - What? - Who in this tiny little hamlet, are you fucking? Let's go. - We'll take my ride. - What'd you do to her? - What I had to. - I did what I had to. He had me over the ropes man. I was looking at eight years. He told me to call you. - Give me a name. - What is this, revenge? You're stealing from your own kind man that's breaking the rules. Right? - Who? - Bondy, he set it up! Took the pictures, he made the letters, gave me all the questions, gave me the answers. You think I'm stupid enough to come with this all by myself? It was Bondy! - Grab your keys. - Page. He.. he runs this town. Just take the money. Go home! Where is he? You're gonna break my arm, ow! What are you..ow! Arrgh! He's at the motel, just go. - For you, me, there's rules! Why? Don't leave me here man. He set it up. You think I'm stupid enough to come up with this all by myself? It was Bondy. Bondy. I suppose that's Phil. - Phil - How did you fuck up something that was so easy? Thanks Earl, why don't you call it a night. Who the fuck are you? I warned you. Small caliber. Go home Walter. Hey, don't forget my fucking boat. - Oh, oh my... - Is he dead? - Not yet. - Separate the twenties and fifties. - He could have been the one. Do you hear me? - Who? - Phil. - He didn't seem like the marrying kind. Separate the hundreds. - You never met him. - True, he did however die in the parking lot of a low end bar, in a one streetlight town as a result of being an ineffective criminal so I do have some point of reference. - He was funny, that's more than I can say for you. - I don't see people writing songs about you. Hey wipe your hands before you get in here okay. - Your brother? He was an asshole. Phil was an asshole. You need to hang with a better class of people. What's your name? Your name. - Vera. - When you put your makeup on in the morning Vera do you use a mirror? You gotta look at yourself every day. Then you still got a chance. Get out. Get out of here. Get out! Hmmm. Miller Motel. Don't even think about it. - Well, well, it's Fat Tuesday boys and you're already loading up this week's fee. I like your initiative. Thank you boys. See you next Tuesday. Who the fuck are you? - Bag. Looks like you guys aren't getting the protection you're paying for. - This doesn't change a thing. You find a way of getting me my money. - Hold 'em boys. Your little stunt, our chance encounter took down my whole operation. It took me two years to learn how to walk again. I lost my job, everything. - You weren't even a cop. You were a hood, with a squad car, still are. All this to set me up for robbery. - You're going down for more than robbery. Who's gonna believe a thief? - You're both thieves. - Walter, it's about time you grew a pair. - Don't even think about it, you either. - You already figured it out. I wasn't in your place 30 seconds and the cops showed. He was setting me up and shaking you down at the same time. - That's my money. Walter, put the gun down. There's been too much work put into this for you to fuck it up right now! Mills! - Get on the ground! - What? - Now. - Give me that fucking gun and get the fuck out of here! You're in way over your head! - Our deal still stands. Thanks for the call. I'll hang it all on Bondy. It's time for you to go but not with the money. - Keep it. It's counterfeit. Only thing that got stolen was my watch. - Give me one good reason. - Every time you put your makeup on I'll be looking back. ♪ I'm driving out away from Illinois ♪ ♪ Thinking about, I'm just a boy ♪ ♪ Mamma I can still hear your voice ♪ ♪ Come good, come bad I've made this choice ♪ ♪ You say that life is beautiful ♪ ♪ I say, it's a cruel mystery ♪ ♪ Yes it is ♪ ♪ It's a cruel mystery ♪ ♪ Driving out into the sun ♪ ♪ Thinkin' bout how far I've come ♪ ♪ Thinking how I might end up dead ♪ ♪ With my hands on the wheel and a gun to my head ♪ ♪ Well you say that life is beautiful ♪ ♪ I say, it's a cruel mystery ♪ ♪ Yes it is ♪ ♪ It's a cruel mystery ♪ ♪ There's a way to hold your hands when you're ♪ ♪ throwing dice ♪ ♪ That guarantees that you win the prize ♪ ♪ And you're thinking how it paid well ♪ ♪ While you're sitting there in your jail cell ♪ ♪ Well you say that life is beautiful ♪ ♪ I say, it's a cruel mystery ♪ ♪ Yes it is ♪ ♪ Cruel mystery ♪ ♪ It's a cruel mystery ♪ ♪ Yes it is ♪
