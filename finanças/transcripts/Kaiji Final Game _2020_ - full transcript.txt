The year is 2020. The end of the Tokyo Olympics, which were held with great national fanfare, triggered the country's economy to slow down at a frightening pace. The national debt is well over 1.5 quadrillion yen, and prices are rising due to inflation. The unemployment rate is now 40%, and foreign investors are buying up exhausted and cheaply sold Japanese technology like vultures. Be quiet! Freeze! Now in this country, only the rich and powerful can survive, while the weak with no money are easily crushed. They try to stay alive by huddling together. Money. It's all because of money. Bring 'em over! Don't just stand there! We aren't done yet. Tsugii Daichi! Sir! Good work. Sugiyama Shihoko! Sir! Here. Good work. Itou Kaiji! Sir. Takahata Tsukasa! Is this all I'm getting? The hell? Why do you gotta take 70% of the money? We're the ones working here! Yeah! Shut your mouths! This is ridiculous! Hey, you okay? Sugiyama can't stop coughing for over a month now. She's not like us. She used to be a good watchmaker. A watchmaker? The store closed in a flash thanks to this recession... Take a break. My child is still young. And I have to take care of my parents. Now that my husband has died, I can't afford to fail here. That's all! Hey. Hey, wait a minute! You can't just let her die. She's an employee too! Help her! Don't make a scene at the company's door! What an ugly sight. It's President Kurosaki. That lady doesn't work for us, she's just a temp. Stop screwing with us. You exploit us way too much. You should help us a little when we're in trouble! Help you? I've been giving work opportunities to incompetent folks like you. What more do you want? You wouldn't have a job without us! Yeah! Then quit! Everyone who wants to quit should do it now. Leave. Leave. I said leave! What's wrong? Anyone who wants to quit should come forward now. Of course. None of you have any prowess or education. You lot don't have anywhere else to work, do you? You should hold nothing but gratitude for me. There's absolutely nothing to complain about. You bums should just shut up and follow suit. Go to hell... You're taking advantage of us! Hey, Kurosaki! Let me go! Wait... Shit... It's as if all of Japan is in Teiai's underground. Canned beer?! Beer, 1,000 yen Juice, 550 yen Chips, 600 yen Ice-cold stuff! 1,000 yen for one can? The prices are up again! Why's it so damn expensive? I'll resist. Ahh, so good! A single beer surely isn't enough! Long time no see, Kaiji. Foreman... Delicious! It's been a while since I've had corned beef. You could eat a whole bowl of rice with it. That's great. If you had the money, you could even have a set meal with grilled meat. Grilled meat set?! No way. It's not easy to earn enough for that in this day and age. That's not true. You could actually pull it off, Kaiji. Why don't you stop acting all pompous and get to the point? What do you mean? You went out of your way to see me and get me food. You wouldn't do this without a reason, would you? Actually, I've been thinking about partnering up with you. The Greatest Scuffle Ever Tower of Babel Tower of Babel... I'm told it's being hosted by an old man who has more money than he can handle. Not related to Teiai. I know. There's a big pole standing on a rooftop within the city, and people fight over the card stuck to the top of that pole, right? You know your stuff. In addition to this, they're holding various relief events around the country. They say it's helping to calm the riots of young people who are depressed and uncertain about the future. It's way too competitive for that. There's no way to plan a strategy in a game of luck where you don't know which rooftop the pole is on in the first place. Exactly. But on the flip side, if you know the place, you've got a chance of winning. You sound like you do know it. I got a tip that this game will have the pole on top of that building. Don't you think this is your chance to become a millionaire? How high is the pole? About eight meters. Fund me. What? You want me to join, don't you? Do you expect me to pay outta my own pocket? Very well. But I want 50% of my share when you succeed. 50 percent? What, you're taking half? Kaiji. Your employer Goodwill Industries ripped you off by 70%, right? Compared to that, 50% is downright charity. Damn... Tower of Babel Yokohama Pier 4, Warehouse 13 Warehouse 13? That's the warehouse! And here we are! The fifth youth relief event! This time we have Tower of Babel, held for the second time! The pole is erected at what used to be a popular dating spot for young people here in Yokohama! Ow... You dummies! Oh, go to hell! Ow! Hey, I think someone just tripped me! Isn't that against the rules? Ow, I broke my foot! I definitely just broke it! Ow... The participants have only one goal: the life-changing card attached to the top of the pole! The front of it is a calculator that only returns money for the numbers you type in. The max is a whopping 999.99 million yen! On the other hand, the back of it has the "magic key." It's said to yield top-secret, life-changing information, but no one knows the details as of yet! Idiots. That's not how you win. If you try going for it head-on, you're done for. Alright... Don't look down. Shit, this is just like the bridge I once crossed! Why the hell am I doing this again? Over there! Guys, shake them out! Outta the way! Don't you dare get up here! Buzz off! Fall! There's no end to them, Sugawara! Shut up! Do something! What's that? Whoa! Something just appeared up in the sky! What is it? A drone? Found the card... Piece of cake! What an idea! A manipulator that doesn't require climbing the pole to get the card! Somebody shoot it down! Use whatever! Ow! Throw at it! All right! Sugawara, look! Crap! Crap... Somebody stop him! Attention Point C standby. Enemy located on top of Yokohama Pier 4, Warehouse 12. Hurry! Alright, I'm here! The card is mine! Careful. Careful... Careful! Hey, stop it. That's dangerous! Fall down! Stop! I'll die if I fall! I said I'll die if I fall! Shake him! Don't hesitate, just drop him! Drop him! I'll die if I fall! Now's our chance! I'm gonna die if I fall! Don't shake me! I said don't shake me! Shit... Shit! And he fell! The young man tragically hit the ground! All right! I got it! Huh? Hey, turn on! It's broken! It's not broken. This card has a fingerprint scanner. It'll only respond to whoever touched it first. Whoever touched it first? Did he really... Ow... Who is it? Who won? You did! I did? He won! We have a winner! All right! That's what I'm talking about, Kaiji! Now, do you want to choose the front or the back of the card? Well, that's an obvious choice! Right, Kaiji? The back. Yeah, yeah yeah, the back! The back! The back, yeah! The back?! The top secret intel shrouded in mystery! He chose the "magic key"! Kaiji: Final Game Prime Minister Shibusawa should step down! Step down! You're responsible for the financial collapse! Own up to it! Money! Don't come! This is Teiai Land. The only amusement spot built underground that offers a brief respite from the bleakness of life outside. But even within the only place of entertainment, the gap between the rich and the poor is stark. Oh, there it is! I got it! Times 144 is over 200 million yen! In this world of monstrous inflation, cash is useless. Now convert 'em! Minister, Takakura wishes to see you. METI, Cabinet Minister Komiyama Shocking METI Scandal Gambling Frenzy With Public Expense Organization-Wide Cover-Up Revealed?! What's this? At a critical time when we're trying to change Japan, mixing up public and private affairs is a bad look. The same goes for you. The yen's slump was unstoppable and cash is now completely unreliable. It's a commodity that is diminishing daily. We need gold. If you say so, why don't you play rock-paper-scissors with me here? You mean that Gold RPS thing? Yes. I know. I hear you play it a lot for entertainment. A 3-round game. The rule is that you must hold this gold and play it at least once out of three times. In other words, you have to play Rock once. If you hold the gold and win with Rock, you can get that gold as a bonus. I know that! Let's fight! I don't need your money. Let's see... for example, if I win, how about you quit your minister position? Fine. Rock, paper... Breaking news! Komiyama Kimihiko, cabinet minister of the METI, has announced his intention to resign, citing poor health, as stated by government officials. News Flash: Minister Komiyama Resigns Mr. Komiyama... He only played Rock, it seems. What a foolish man. Mr. Takakura, it's time to attend the panel of experts. I need your honest opinions so we can rebuild Japan. I'm Takakura, Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister. Here's my idea of an emergency fiscal policy. We increase sales tax to 30%, cut pension benefits by 40%, and abolish welfare payments. Hold up. We only recently raised the pensionable age. That's going too far! The citizens wouldn't allow it. What will that do to the poor?! But Takakura... Is it really possible to rebuild Japan just by reducing social security payments? Do you know how much the entire country's worth of securities and insurances costs in total? 1.5 quadrillion yen, the same as the national and local debt. If we could tap into the assets of the people... Oh, isn't that curious. The country's debts would be wiped clean, wouldn't they? It's the only way Japan will survive. Namely... A "set-off." Is it here? I knew it! You got called in here too! Who're you? Kirino Kanako. What, you don't know? I won the second relief event held in Osaka with flying colors. Haven't seen it, nor do I care. Is money all you care about? Obviously. So why'd you choose secret intel over a fortune? The winner of the first event, who chose cash, is dead now. Prize Recipient Robbed And Killed Man Dies From Stabbing These days, if you win big, the whole country will notice and you'll never get away with it. So it's smarter to choose a magic key that has the same value as a fortune. Information is golden. And you can make a lot of money as a result. You think so too? Sure. We might have more in common than I thought! Right? Sorry for the wait. Were you the one who organized that event? So you're the secretary, huh? You're handsome! Kirino Kanako. In the second event, out of the thousands of cards falling from the sky, you've drawn the winning one. Winner of the Osaka Tournament I drew the right one! The Divine Trick Has Manifested (Self-Proclaimed) The Luckiest Girl (Self-Proclaimed) I did it! Right. I'm the lucky girl, after all. You are the duo with exactly the kind of luck and ambition the chairman was looking for. A billion yen wasn't enough to satisfy you. That's what ambition is. That's what I value. You can stop now. I've had to work very hard to get here. Tell us about this secret, life-changing information that you have. The government is up to something no good behind the scenes. The government? The deposit blockade. What's a "deposit blockade"? The government will restrict the people's ability to withdraw bank deposits and other financial funds that they have. We can't withdraw our own money? That's not all. Moreover, the government is trying to issue a new currency, the "Teiyen," at the same time as the deposit blockade. What happens if it's issued? They are using the public's wealth to "offset" the national debt. What about our on-hand cash and the money that's still in the bank? It will vanish. But, like, I don't really have any savings, and neither does Kaiji. The problem is that only an elite group of people can get that information before it's too late, and run while they're ahead. "Run while they're ahead"? The man at the center of this project is a former METI bureaucrat who is now Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister, Takakura. I know him! He's the one they call Shadow Prime Minister, right? But if what you're saying is true, why don't you escape while you're ahead? The chairman does not have long to live. Why run when I'm going to die soon? So I figured the one last thing I want to do is serve my country. Serve it? How exactly? I'll stop the deposit blockade before the Ceremony of Fate. "Ceremony of Fate"? The time limit is ten days before the meeting to decide on the deposit blockade. That's the Ceremony of Fate. No matter how excellent and powerful Takakura is, he doesn't get to decide on national policies. So you're going to bribe the politicians to nullify the bill. There are only a handful of people who could be the "key" to this deposit blockade. All it would take is an effective bribe to stop these people. However, I've only got 50 billion yen on hand right now. How much money will it take to bribe them? 100 billion. 100 billion?! No way, that's crazy! Are we going to raise 50 billion in just 10 days? The rest of the money needed for the bribe will be earned in a gamble. We need the two of you with your luck and ambition to help us win that gamble. So we can save Japan! For real?! Isn't that cool? We're gonna... Idiot. What's in it for us, anyway? Obviously I'm not asking you to help us for free. I'll return the favor in kind. I'm in! I mean, it's a heck of a project, right? And we're the stars of this project, aren't we? C'mon, let's do it, Kaiji! This might turn out to be the funnest thing you've ever experienced. Nines! What? You know, "to the nines" means "to perfection" and it sounds like "nice." Nines! Enough, stop. What's "nines" about this? I'm not doing it. Plus you're younger than me. Don't call me by my first name! Why not? Quit fooling around! I'm out. And if the opponent is from Teiai? Teiai? The chairman will participate in a gamble that takes place in Teiai Land. There, he and his arch-rival will compete for each other's assets. He's from the dispatch agency I work at... In just a few years, Kurosaki has risen to the top of the Japanese dispatch industry, and they call him "Japan's Dispatch King." You work for one of Teiai Group's businesses as well. So it's all Teiai's group... Kurosaki is another one of the elites trying to get away unscathed. Damn it! Okay, okay, I'll do it! But you'll have to pay me handsomely. I promise that. All right! Sounds like a plan, then! So what's the big gamble? How do we play? It is the cruelest gamble ever held in Teiai Land. Final Judgment: The Human Scale. So this is Teiai Land? Is this your first visit too, Kaiji? Haven't been here since it was built. Fame. Money. The winners will get all of it, while the losers lose it all. That's what Final Judgment: The Human Scale is. Final Judgment: The Human Scale That is Final Judgment. Final Judgment: The Human Scale The ultimate all-out gamble, No.1 Hostess Arisa, Kabukichou Queen where two matched-up opponents exchange all of their wealth for gold and compete to weigh it on a scale that serves as a balance. No.1 Host Boy Kenya, Prince of Shinjuku Host Boy King VS Hostess Queen This game is largely a battle between individuals. Two men with evenly matched holdings can fight each other. One will lose everything, while the other double their assets. You can gain everything! Winner takes all the gold! Also, this game's biggest feature is that you can attach supporters. "Supporters"? Family. Friends. Fixers. The decisive factor is how many supporters you can prepare beforehand, and how many of your opponent's supporters you can convince to join your team on the day of the fight. So you compete for your opponent's support too? Yes, but in the end, the winner will be decided by the "Fans" near the end of the game. That is, we're told, the audience in the hall. He said in bed all the time that it's easy to make a fool out of a woman! Just look at his ugly mug! What the hell? That's what his face actually looks like. Your face is a fake made to trick women. He's horrible! Go to hell! Please believe me! I'll pay you back tenfold! In the case of the "fans," if they bet on the winner, they'll get double the money back. Gimme some more! Throw more! More! Are the scales that high? The scales rise every hour. They'll be up to that height in about four hours. So, inevitably, the "fans" will compete by throwing gold coins instead of bars. The Winner Hostess Queen I did it! She earned 2.98 billion yen! You're next! Can we check the hall in advance? It's under maintenance right now. Due to repair delays, only authorized personnel will be allowed in until the showdown. Hm. I see. Y'know, you're so straight-faced all the time. Have you ever smiled? What's that? "Dream Jump"? Recruiting Suicidal People Dream Jump General floor users will be refused. Dream Jump Tickets available for VIPs only. A life-changing death gamble. All participants are suicidal, and nine out of ten of them will die. What the heck? Only the one who picks the single tied rope will survive. Just one person who jumps after their dream will win a fortune. "If you wish to kill yourself, please contact the staff." "This shall be your hopeful suicide." The game is about to begin. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1... Bungee! The wealthy enjoy guessing who the sole survivor is going to be. That must be the very definition of "sickening"... You like that gamble, don't you? It's delightful indeed. I am the one who came up with it, in fact. How well are the preparations going? Very well. I'm also hoping for your assistance. You can count on me. President Kurosaki. Yes? I heard there's a new man joining Tougou's side. Who is it? Itou Kaiji. Kaiji? We at Teiai have a history with this man... You exploit us way too much. You wouldn't have a job without us! Yeah! So that was Itou Kaiji? Let me introduce you to my younger brother, Yoshinobu. I own land in Minato. That land is already in the name of my daughter and her husband, who are married, so the enemy won't find out. What's it worth? About 5 billion. 5 billion! Sweet, we can bet that 5 billion! We really gotta win this, Gramps. I know. Is there anyone else? My brother's weakness is the "family" part. I'm his only family. You're not married? My wife left me over 20 years ago and I've been on my own ever since. What do we do? If we're struggling with "family," who's gonna fill the gap? This is the list of "friends" and "fixers" who have agreed to help so far. The chairman's biggest supporter is within the "friend" part. I know him! President of Doumoto Technics, Doumoto Masaharu. That famous IT company? It's apparently worth over 50 billion in total assets. He's my brother's best friend from school days. He came forward to support him for this game. But if they find out, they'll go after Doumoto for sure. Did you take care of that? We did. We have a safe place for him to stay. Mr. Kaiji... May I have a moment? Thing is, I couldn't mention it at the time, but the chairman had a long-time lover. Lover? They had a child together. You know a lot of personal things about him, don't you? Yes. I've been his secretary for three years now. I know everything about him. So what happened to his lover? One day he suddenly left her and her child, and sent a yet unseen painting as severance pay. Painting? He must have sent her a painting of exceptional value. So if we can get her to donate the painting to us, we'll have a significant advantage. Does the old man know where she is? Even if he knew, I don't think the chairman would want that. Why not? He gave it so he can cut ties with her. He wanted to break up from the mother and son forever. That's who he is. This isn't the best time for that, is it? We have to win this thing. That's why I want you to find it without the chairman knowing. Any leads? The place where people might know about the lover... It's the man sitting over there. No man was ever as greedy as Tougou. It wasn't until he met his lover, Hiromi, that he became sane. She was very old-fashioned, even back then. She treated me well too. But in the end, Tougou left her. Where is she now? She's gone. Heard she died from a sickness, leaving one child behind. I'm sure the kid hates Tougou. That's about all I know. To those of you who are lodging in Sunny Colony, please leave this area immediately. Here we go again! If you don't pay taxes, you have no right to be here! Please vacate the premises ASAP. It's the state guys. They're trying to get us out of here. If you do not comply today, you will be evicted. Takakura... I think that's enough warnings. Sir. Now let's begin. Start the purge! Come on out! Hey, what're you doing?! You can't force them like that! Wait! Some of them can't walk! You want them to just go out and starve to death? Let go! These people are just old farts who don't work and can't produce anything. If man will not work, he shall not eat! I'll be glad to see you die! It's in the best interest of our country's future. That's the way it is, Mr. Itou Kaiji. How do you know my name? Looking forward to "Final Judgment." Shit. No way... No way! No way! Watch out! What do you want? You're those Tower of Babel guys... Glad you remember. Why are you together? I've put these guys under me since then. Huh? We got an anonymous tip that you were carrying a fortune. Said it's best to strike now. I was going to use that money to reopen this factory. You ruined my chance! Sugawara was building robots for disaster relief here! He was a good engineer, unlike a bum like you! Now give me that money, Kaiji. I don't have any! You saw that I didn't choose money, right? But aren't you rich now? Not yet! Are you guys morons or what? What? You pulled a stupid stunt without planning ahead. Do you show your face when robbing people? So long as you don't kill me now, you can all be arrested! So can you do it? Do you dare to kill me? W-We'll kill you! What the hell? You're shaking like leaves. That's why you could never do it. You play by the book and can't come up with stopgap measures. You just go with the flow! You bums will never break out if you're glued to each other like this. In fact, with your kinda life, you'll just be bums again even when you're reborn. Bums! Bums! Bums! Just an endless cycle of debauchery, followed by death! Am I wrong? Sugawara. Yes, we're all bums here. We already know that! But you don't have to rub it in, man! I just don't want this factory my father left for me to go under! Yeah, that's it! If you need money that badly, you're gonna have to work with me. Mr. Takase! Please. I need a job. You again. Man, you're persistent. I'll do anything! Please! Please! Please! Can you do this, then? Stop asking if you can't even do it! Dream Jump Recruiting Suicidal People You don't need to do that. Kaiji? I have a job that only you can do, Sugiyama. Thank you very much! Folks. You've worked very hard today. The showdown begins tomorrow. Can't have you acting nervous now! It'll be fine. You've got this lucky girl by your side. Lucky girl? Yeah, right. Good luck with the show tomorrow. Ready, set, nines! Oh, would you stop that?! Gramps, can we talk in private for a minute? Sure. Oh, I can go on my own. I'm counting on you guys. Any objections? None! Final Judgment Thank you for your patience. The "Real Estate King VS Dispatch King" battle is about to begin. Let's welcome the two players. Well, if it isn't Kaiji. Is it really fine for you to take a break from your dispatch job today? Why you... Zip it. Just so we're clear, I won't go down like Ichijou and Tonegawa. Let's hope not. Almost forgot. I'll handle it. Please take your seats. Now for the rules of "Final Judgment." 1) The battle lasts for 5 hours; from 12:00 to 17:00. 2) All gold coins wagered within the time limit are valid. 3) The order of the three "F"s will be chosen by the roulette wheel. 4) At 14:00, 16:00 and 17:00, we'll reveal which scale is heavier. 5) The gold bars and coins that fell on the ground will be confiscated by Teiai. If neither player objects to these rules, sign this pledge and we'll be ready to go. I have nothing. Is that the gold bar exchanger? Yeah. You trade cash for gold there. One gold bar is worth 120 million. In addition to cash, there's also a state-of-the-art appraisal system that can convert valuables into gold bars and coins on the spot. It's begun. It's basically what I thought it'd be. The assets on that side amount to about 40 billion to start with. Our side has 50 billion. We are at an advantage. Due to preparations exceeding the scheduled time, the start time of "Final Judgment: The Human Scale" has been delayed to 12:10, and it will end at 17:10. Kurosaki, the Dispatch King. I used to work in a finance-related field. But lending money to people who don't have it isn't going to help them! Why don't we offer jobs instead of money? Don't you think that's the ultimate solution to the problem? So I appealed directly to Chairman Hyoudou of the Teiai Group about setting up a dispatch company called Goodwill Industries. I have sent hundreds of temp workers to this man's company, but he terminated all of their contracts due to downturns. The verdict? My valued temp workers have fallen on hard times, and some of them have taken their own lives. What are you talking about? That's not true! I've come here to avenge them! Look at him spill a bunch of crap outta his mouth. I've kicked a lot of people to the curb, and I've had my share of employees resent me for it. It is indeed true that I've never lived a life of praise. But right now, I can't leave this country on the brink of sinking! This man is taking advantage of the messy inflation crisis, and making temp employees work for unfair wages! The dispatch employees I had working for my company took their lives because of it! I'm the one who wants revenge here! Nice. Now on to the roulette selection! Stop! Good. The first F is "Friends." We'll have pals rushing in to support us with their own money. Friends. Bring them in. Thank you for coming, my friends! Now toss the gold bars onto the scale! Their age range seems all over the place to me. I'm glad you came, Michinori. Thank you, thank you! I didn't expect you to come, Shunichirou! I appreciate it. Thank you! They act too distant to be his friends... Are they really friends with him? No way in hell. He got these dispatchers in debt so they can come here with money. Otherwise they're fired. Good luck. Thank you. Sorry you had to come this far. Wish you luck. Not at work? Did you take a day off? My goodness! Thank you so much. That's not good. He's won the hearts of the "fans." Tougou! Now we're in business! I have come! Machimura! Sweet! We got a big one! Whoa! Who was he, again? His classmate from high school. Hey, man. Why don't you smile a little? Now is not the best time. Guys! Our friends here are well-known collectors of art and antiques. They provided a precious ivory and coral for this battle. Evaluation Complete How much is it? Did it hit 100 million? I am sorry, but this ivory and coral aren't registered. What? How's that even possible? It was traded illegally, wasn't it? You can't convert something obtained through an illegal deal. How's it illegal? That's what Machimura spent his pension on! Stand back! Let me go! Let go! I object! There's something wrong with the system! Call the experts now! Oh, please, it's a little too late for that one! The fight has already begun. Besides, didn't you sign a pledge saying you didn't object to the rules? Goddamn you. Why's he still not here? He's taking too long. I cannot reach him. Is he really coming here? Oh, dear... my condolences, Mr. Tougou. It seems like your dear friend has given up on you. Why, you may be my enemy, but it's heartbreaking to see you like this. You shut the hell up! He's here. Doumoto! I've been waiting. What's wrong? I'm sorry, Tougou. Why the hell? Why'd you betray the old man? This isn't what you promised. Oh, but there's nothing you can do about it, Kaiji. He noticed how well-liked I am, and that makes him want to bet on me, even if it means betraying his friend. That's all. He made a tough decision. Can you really blame him? Bastard... President Kurosaki came up to me the other day and told me to bet on him. That sounds like trouble. If the fraudulent accounting is made public, the company will naturally go out of business, won't it? Tougou, please forgive me. Kurosaki, how far are you willing to pull shit like that? You're asking me that now? That's just what this game is like. If there's anything you should blame, it's your own vulnerability. Folks! What a harrowing and grueling game this is! But I will certainly live up to the expectations of all my friends who believed in me and bet on me! Damn it. Time is up. Stop! Fixers. Bring them in. What's going on here? We're terribly sorry! Our company can only lend up to 30 million! Why?! That's not what we agreed on! Weren't you supposed to lend 1 billion? Lots of people have asked the old man for money in the past, and now they turn their back on him when he asks them for it? This isn't right! The higher-ups gave us an order! We apologize! Even the bank changed sides... It is now 14:10. We will now show how the two players scale. Please come forward. Since there is a weight difference of 8kg between them, we will add 8kg to the lighter player in advance. Now, observe! That's pretty bad. Ours started out with far more assets than him, and he's already caught up with us. Mr. Takakura, they've all arrived. The next one is "Family," which will be a true test of family ties. Now we got the most disadvantageous "F." Hey, Kuro! I've been waiting for you, my wife! Your wife?! We married three days ago. She's Reika, the daughter of a wealthy man from Shinagawa. Three days ago?! It's so obvious that he married her just for this day! How rude. What're you on about? We were meant to be. I'm sorry, Kuro. Daddy was only willing to pay a mere 11 billion! Check I don't think that's how you use the word "mere"! This is bad. I've got it, Brother! This is a deed to a plot of land in Minato. It's worth about 5 billion. They aren't fazed at all. A mere 5 billion doesn't shock them anymore. Evaluation Complete Evaluation is over. What's going on? Hey, isn't it worth 5 billion?! Ah, yes... yes, yes, that's right. I see now. Tough luck, Kaiji. It's true that the market value of that land is 5 billion, but that was only until just now. What do you mean? The price has plummeted, don't you know? Plummeted? Even I can't help but feel bad for you. The government just announced that a landfill will be built around that site. Did you really get the government on board too? Now don't start smearing my good name! It's no more than a coincidence. Thank you, Reika. You can go now. It was him... It was that man. Takakura. How did the information about his brother's land get into the hands of the enemy? And how did they find out where his friend Doumoto was hiding until the day of the fight? Is it possible that someone leaked our intel... What? Why? What is happening? Was it you? Were you the one who leaked our information to Kurosaki? Yes. What the heck's going on? And you were the one who got those Tower of Babel guys to attack me when you made me go out looking for the painting? What do you want? That one didn't work out. Why, Hirose? Could it be? Come on, show them what you've brought. There it is! The legendary masterpiece! I will never forgive you for leaving my mother. You have Hiromi's... Yes, I do. I'm the son of the lover you abandoned. I didn't even know what my mother looked like, so this was the only way I could feel her presence. I'll exchange this for gold bars and bet on Kurosaki. I'm going to destroy you! Tell me, Kaiji... What's this all about? A revenge tragedy if I've ever seen one! Hey, Tougou. When I was investigating you, I found out that the lover you left in the past had a son. That son approached you to become your secretary so he can get revenge on you. I know I could put him to use. This guy hated you with all his heart, after all. What a sad sight, Tougou. Letting your lover's... I mean, your own son pull the carpet from under your feet. Well, don't blame me. You got the wrong guy. What do you think, everyone? He was clearly asking for it, wasn't he? So, how much will this legendary masterpiece be worth? Is it Van Gogh or Da Vinci? Either way, it's surely no less than 10 billion! Evaluation Complete What kind of crazy price did we get? My victory's set in stone now. Um, actually, it seems to be completely worthless. Worthless? Of course it is. That's the old man's painting. What'd you say? Last night, I asked him about the painting. Tell him, Gramps. It was a gift from me when Hiromi was pregnant with you. My wife wasted a lot of money trying to conceive a boy. I was all about expanding my career, and money was all I had in life. Are you closed? It's alright. Welcome. Come on in. Hiromi Thanks for the food. It was then when I met Hiromi, your mother. She made me realize that there are things that money can't buy. Would you like another one? Shortly after, I found out she was pregnant. I decided to leave my wife and live with you two. That painting describes my vision of an ideal future. But when you were born, Hiromi passed away. She wasn't very resillient, after all. I've been looking for you ever since. You're lying. You're lying. Lying! That's gotta be a lie! That painting isn't worth a single yen. This is the frame's worth. Legendary masterpiece, my foot. Good job bringing me something completely useless, you deadhead. I don't need you anymore. Just get out of my sight. Time is almost up. You've worked as the old man's secretary for 3 years. Don't you know better than anyone whether what he said is true or not? In the meantime, if you wanted to take revenge on the old man in any way, you could. And yet you've done nothing. You were clearly no longer sure about that in your time spent with him. You weren't certain if he really abandoned you and your mother anymore. That's why you kept working as his secretary for three years, without taking the chance. Until Kurosaki found you. Quit standing around! Wage that broken gold coin and get the hell out of here! You're no longer useful! It's your choice which way to throw it. I've always hated you. Whatever the reason, it doesn't change the fact that you made my mother feel lonely... But... I'm sure that's what my mother would have done. Observe! I did it. I've caused an upset! He's finally overtaken us... Hm? What's with the glum faces? Where did all your energy go? Hello? Our assets are worth 50.1 billion. His assets are worth roughly over 60 billion. We're about 10 billion short. What should we do? We can't overtake him with that big a difference! It's time for you guys to be the star of the show! Next up is the final stage. The time for "fans"! Your gold coins you have on-hand are numbered. It's so we know who threw them into which scale. If you bet on the winner, you'll get double your money back! One gold coin is worth 300 grand. That's a lot of money for the broke folks. If it doesn't reach the scale, Teiai will confiscate it. Let's do it! Please go ahead! Come further in! Come on, don't be shy! Throw them all in there! Kaiji, we need to appeal to them more! No point. Money determines a man's worth. They'll all bet on winning horse. Basically, people will get drawn to wherever they're more likely to get money in the end. But still, if we don't do something... No one will reach out to the penniless. People without money are worth nothing. But, I don't want to accept that. I'll fight until the very end. We're here to turn this overwhelming defeat upside down. Gramps. Kaiji. Do it. Sugawara! Yeah! Get outta the way! Out the way! All right! What are you doing? The trump card I've been saving for this occasion: 1 billion. I got it just in case I needed to make money off a gamble. Gramps, can we talk in private for a minute? Sure. A billion? Yeah. If the worst should happen, I'm going to multiply that billion in a gamble for you. So can you leave it in my care? That must be the main reason you got me to join you in the first place. A mere 2-3 billion won't be enough to turn the tables, you know. Yeah, you're right. So in the next 30 minutes, I'll multiply it by 10 and come back here. Wait, I'll go with you! Hey, you're coming with us. Sheesh! Whose side are you on, anyway? You don't have to force yourself. Why are you all closing up? It's not over yet, is it? The VIP floor is closed today. Why's that?! Kaiji! It's no good, the gambling spots are closed on all floors. We're too late. Kurosaki took the lead! What should we do, Kaiji? You... I don't want to accept that people without money are worthless, either. So I'll fight too! So you're carrying on Tougou's work? But... What can we do in this situation? You're done? No way, there have to be other places. Wait, you're all closed? Endou? I thought I was gonna blow off some steam with a little gambling while on a break. It's your fault, Kaiji. Mine? Only the bungee jumping game is open right now, but everything else is closed. Kurosaki's orders. Go to hell, Kurosaki... It does seem like something that man would do. He wants you to go bungee jumping so he can kill you, doesn't he? Well, don't fall for it! That game has no chance of winning. Not unless you know the winning number in advance. How well do you know this place? Well, I am a former Teiai executive, for one thing. I think I know better than most of the others. We should get going too. Okay, I'll go to the dumps. I'll get to the engine room. Hold it. Huh? You mean me? I want to play here. I'm betting my entire 1 billion. It's not the usual Dream Jump, though, since no customer bought a voting ticket... The odds are one in ten. If I win, you'll give me ten times the money. That's my special rule. You were waiting for me to come here, weren't you? Go ahead. Dream Jump Choose one of these ropes for bungee jumping. The ropes extend from inside the black box. Only one of the randomly selected ropes is locked to the drum and will be the winning rope. I got the rules. Get it started. Pick a rope. The most recent game was at 16:30. Just as planned, Kaiji's will play the bungee jumping game. He's knowingly following his own doom. What a complete idiot. Hey, folks! You can stop now! That's enough. Don't vote for me. It's a done deal. Any more bets and my share will be reduced. What's wrong? Pick now! Hurry up, Kaiji! Foolish man. We can manipulate the winning numbers, so Kaiji has no chance of winning. What's wrong? It's not working. What'd you say?! I can't change the previous game's winning number! What should we do? Do we stop the game? Are you kidding me? Kurosaki has ordered us to kill Kaiji in this game. So what do we do? How's Final Judgment? It's hanging on this game's outcome... Then let's do it. What? If Kaiji loses here, we'll have done as Kurosaki ordered. On the other hand, in the unlikely event that Kaiji survives, Kurosaki will be ruined. In other words, one way or the other, it doesn't matter to me. So why don't we just do it? Excuse me. I left something in there. You can't go in right now. I left my wallet in there. Let me go get it, please. Hurry! What's wrong, Kaiji? Choose it now! Kaiji! Kaiji! Shit, she got caught. You don't have much time, Kaiji. Make your choice now! Hm? What is it? That mouth shape... is it ten or nine? 9? 10? Which is it? Hurry it up, Kaiji! Ten! I got it. Let's go with 10. Yes, sir. He picked 10. It's time to go! 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1... Mr. Kurosaki. Kaiji chose 10, the killing rope. Yeah! I win! I win! Victory is mine! Gramps! Everyone, move! Move, guys! Kaiji?! Hang in there, Gramps! You okay? Kaiji... I'm counting on you... Hey, somebody carry the old man out! I'm sorry I never realized it was you, Minato. Excuse us. Didn't you choose the killing rope? I switched it last minute. Damn. You've got the devil's own luck in everything. Moron! There's no way I'd pick a rope willy-nilly for that crazy gamble! There was only one way to win that game without fail. You have to know the winning number beforehand. Well, don't fall for it! That game has no chance of winning. Not unless you know the winning number in advance. That's why I asked my guy to cut the power for the black box. Then the winning number was unchanged from the last game. What's wrong? Then all I had to do was pick the right rope. In other words, find the only number that wasn't in the pile of busts. There was just one mishap. When I was told the winning number, I couldn't tell if it was 9 or 10. The "ooo" mouth shape she made could mean either "nine" or "ten" in Japanese. But then, for a moment, her gesture made me realize it was nine. You know, "to the nines" means "to perfection" and it sounds like "nice." Nines! 3, 2, 1... Wait, wait, wait! That's why I was able to switch just before jumping. Yeah! Dammit! You're too late now, though. The game is over! I'm the winner! Look at the clock. It's 17:10. It's over. Nope, the game's not done yet. Don't know when to give up, do you? I said it's over! We still have 5 minutes left. That clock is five minutes too fast. Look at your watch. It's true. We have five more minutes. Hey, show me your watch. Hurry! What's the meaning of this? The correct current time is 17:05. The game will only truly end when the clock reaches 17:15. We can still fight. What's the point of this? What can you do in the next five minutes? The scale is too high for you to throw those gold bars in! Plus it's time for the swing vote. You can't put them in. It's a win-win. For me! We'll see about that. Alright, folks! Make way, make way! Coming through! Since the gold bars are carried by these guys, it counts as a swing vote! We had already prepared for this moment by modifying the drones to move the heavy gold bars. That can't be! There's still time! Move 'em up! Okay! Watch out! Make some space! Nice, they grabbed them! Curses! Alright! Now's the time, guys! Throw all your gold coins to our side! What are you waiting for? The odds are with us now! Vote for us with all the gold coins you have! Vote for me, all of you! Vote! Vote! What's wrong? Come on, vote! I'll acknowledge your help! Hurry up and vote! Vote! If you vote for me now, I'll make all of you full-time employees of my company! Come on and vote! Vote! Vote now! Kaiji! You... I'm here to help you! Win for me. Ya gotta win this thing! Thank you, old man Sakazaki. Why are you guys just standing around? Everyone vote for Kaiji! He's right. Who would vote for Kurosaki? Down with Kurosaki! Go! Wait... Keep throwing! Throw to us! Don't waste them! Aim properly! Don't drop 'em! Yeah! Now's your chance! We're gonna win! Throw all the gold coins you have on hand to us! That's it! Just do it! Throw more! What are you doing? Go this way! I'm the winner here! Come on, keep throwing! Throw more, everybody! Throw them here! No way we're gonna lose to Kurosaki! Keep going! Executives. I'll turn you all into executives! Now vote! Vote! Damn! That's right! Everybody vote! Time is up! What shall it be? Who won? Gentlemen, place yourselves on the scale. I'll stand in for the old man. Frisk me and adjust for weight difference. The Human Scale Observe! We got it. The winner is... Kurosaki, the Dispatch King! Not yet. Hold up. Those gold coins are invalid! No! All gold coins wagered on time are valid! 2) All gold coins wagered within the time limit are valid. I won... I won! We won! Yay! We won! No way! Look. Take a good look at this! It was this broken gold coin that decided the outcome of the game! We've won with this chipped gold coin that you mocked! Why was the clock out of whack? What the hell were the maintenance guys up to? I made the clock go faster. You? No one would look at their watch with such a big clock in front of them. I exploited that fact. And since we were outperformed at the "Family" part, I was forced to gamble recklessly, but gambling for more money when push came to shove was on my mind all along. With five minutes left in the game, the scales are at their highest point, and you, in your ineptitude, can't just toss the gold bars up there. You can only stand still and watch! That's why I desperately needed to make the clock go forward. And that's why I asked a certain someone for help. "Someone"? Hey. Lower the scales. Who are you? The person you fired. Why's she here? I was hired to work here shortly after you fired me. Just as a mere temp lady. You sent a bunch of dispatchers to Teiai, the parent company, and made them work essentially for free! The scales were taking a long time to maintain. Only authorized personnel will be allowed in until the showdown. She was a former watchmaker, and I figured with that background, she could get a job maintaining the scales, which were lagging behind. That's why I went to see her. You don't need to do that. I have a job that only you can do, Sugiyama. Big Ben's pendulum? Shortening the distance between the pendulum's fulcrum and the center of mass will help the clock move faster. Hearing that, I sneaked Sugiyama into Teiai Land, and at the same time, started working with my partners. I'll multiply it by 10 and come back here. What a sad sight, Kurosaki! You've made fools of the dispatchers and trampled over them, only for them to pull the carpet from under you! You reap what you sow! Welcome to the life of the lower class you've been mocking this whole time! Die, you asshole. You piece of crap! Die! Just die! Go to hell! Damn it! Let go! Let go! Let go of me, goddammit! Chairman Hyoudou's orders. Let go! Let go. Let go of me! Come. Let go of me, please! Please, I'm begging you! Let go of me... Let me go! Kaiji, I hope you die! Okay, let's go! I really enjoyed this, actually. That was a very good game, indeed. Takakura... Just so you know, that's not going to stop the deposit blockade. The Ceremony of Fate just came to a close. It moved forward a day. Unanimously in favor, the deposit blockade is now in effect! I was well aware of your plan. We've taken steps to ensure that politicians aren't fazed by bribes, but you can never be too careful. So I pushed it back a day. No way... That was a good guessing game on my part. I'll be seeing you. Hey, Kaiji. Does it mean that we just... It's over. I see. I understand. I was told he just passed away at the hospital. Why? I can't believe Tougou of all people is dead! Damn it. That 100 billion we won could have gone to the politicians. I'm sorry... If I hadn't betrayed him, this wouldn't have happened... It's Tougou's phone. What? Well... he took it out when he was frisked before he went on the scales, so I kept it for him. Non-Disclosed Call Yes? What? You came for the gold? Okay, I'll be right there. What is it, Kaiji? Good thing you kept the phone. You really are a lucky girl! Huh? This way. First Code: Entrance Come in, everyone. Over here. Inside are suitcases with piles of new bills in them. I will now enter the second password. You don't have to tell us. Just open it. Second Code: Container Don't keep us waiting. Hurry up! If someone sees us here, we're in trouble! That's weird. Not opening? What's going on? I don't know. Both the container and entrance/exit codes show a password error. Password error? I'll call you back later. You... I had all the passwords changed. What's the deal with getting us here, Kaiji? The old man never planned on bribing politicians and bureaucrats. Yes. We'll use more effective measures. We got exactly 100 billion. Here are the access codes as promised. I slipped the cash to the string-puller for this scheme, the Printing Bureau, to prevent new money from going to politicians. And now that this happened, the politicians are like rats in a sack. Such foolishness... Takakura, we're done for if they find out about the backroom deals. Listen, if this goes on, we're going to have to cancel the deposit blockade. Hurry and do something! Yes, I'm on it. Please wait where you are. I have a suggestion. Suggestion? I have three envelopes. Inside are new passwords for the suitcases, container, and the entrance/exit. By the way, these only have the beginning of the codes, and the full passwords are in my head. Why don't we... Gamble for these? Gamble? RPS. That entertainment RPS you specialize in. What? What are you on about? He's notorious for his entertainment RPS. You can't beat him! Yeah! He didn't mean it! You two stay out of this. But just as they say, you're an expert at this rock-paper-scissors game. So here's a handicap: I win once, that's it. Then you'll have to cancel the deposit blockade. What do you think, Takakura? We tie, I win. If you accept that, we can play. You win if it's a tie? Obviously. Winning by beating me once is way too much in your favor. If you don't like these conditions, we won't play. Damn. Okay, then. Gold Rock-Paper-Scissors Kaiji! You need to calm down! Buzz off. Stay out of my business. What's your problem? I've been going along this whole time! Get ready. Rules are simple. You must hold this gold and play it at least once out of three times. In other words, you have to play Rock once. If you hold the gold and win with Rock, you can get that gold. You got it? Let me stress again. A tie means I'll win. Even if we both play Rock. Let's begin. First round. Tell me when you're ready. Kaiji... Playing Rock at the end of the game will put me at an overwhelming disadvantage. The first move would be to use up Rock, so the next two rounds are free game. Then it won't matter what's played. His first move should be Rock. He should play that one. Takakura will likely predict that, though. Does that mean Takakura will play Paper? Yeah. Takakura has to play Paper! He smiled? Of course. Takakura will win if it's a tie. So, Takakura doesn't have to dare to play Paper to beat Rock? If he wins with it, Takakura can use up Rock as well, and gain victory on top of that. It's Rock, Kaiji. Takakura will play Rock. Are you done? Let's do it. Rock, paper... Scissors! Ah, shit! Oh, no... He got him all figured out. You played too early! That was too soon! Dammit. The container code. Inform Nishino. Sir. It's no use, Kaiji. I know your moves like the back of my hand. The container is now open. Bad start, Kaiji. Since neither of us played Rock in the first round, surely it's tempting to play it in the second one. I'm gonna win this one as well. Rock, paper, scissors! He's in a bind now. Next is the entrance/exit code. Hey, Kaiji? Now your back's pinned to the wall. Let's get this over with. Last one. The third round. It's the final round. Takakura will win even if they tie. Now he's at a definite advantage. But still, how did Takakura figure out that Kaiji won't play Rock in the first round? Unless he figures out the trick to predicting the first move, Kaiji has no way to win. Takakura said he knows Kaiji's moves like the back of his hand. It's not like he can read Kaiji's mind, is it? Can Takakura use that to... What a silly man. Cluelessly challenging me to a gamble like this is pure idiocy on your part. Let's go. Wait, Kaiji! Keep quiet. I can tell. You didn't grab the gold, so you'll play either Scissors or Paper. I can lose to Scissors if I play Paper, but a tie means I'll win. That's why I'm going to end him with Scissors. Rock, paper, scissors! He did it. He won. Kaiji, you won! What's wrong? Why are you so surprised? You're notorious for your entertainment RPS. This stone is pure gold, 2.5 times heavier than ordinary metal. Whether or not you're holding that heavy pure gold will always show in the slump of your shoulders and arm swings. You used those movements to predict that the opponent will play Rock. You realized that. And so you'd also know instantly that they aren't holding the gold. The rule of thumb is that if they don't hold the gold, they won't play Rock, so you assume they'll play Paper or Scissors. That saved my ass. You're a simpler man than I thought. Now do as promised. Lift the deposit blockade right now! You really think you've won with this, Kaiji? True, you were the first person to play Rock without holding the gold. I believed that people had to be holding the gold if they were gonna play Rock. But! You ended up losing this gamble with me. What're you on about? For the suitcase code, they're set to unlock automatically at noon tomorrow. Are you kidding? That wasn't the plan! Meaning it doesn't matter if there's a code to the suitcases or not. All I needed was the keys to the container and the entrance/exit! I have won! Huh? What about lifting the deposit blockade? That's not necessary. Hold it. You have to keep your word! Don't touch me! You people always do this. The incompetent are quick to resort to force and violence. It disgusts me! I despise people like you! Just pack it up and get lost. You are the ants this country does not need. Go to hell! Takakura, you asshole! Hold it right there! Such a stupid man. Are you okay, Kaiji? Now it's really over... Kaiji, why are you smiling? This just in. The government has agreed to implement a "deposit blockade" and issue a new yen to prevent rapid hyperinflation. As of today, the old yen will be discontinued, Government announces implementation of deposit blockade and the new currency will provide a portion of the cash that companies and individuals deposited in banks and post offices based on their savings. Open up! I want my money back now! Hey, come on out! Can I pay you later? Three more days... just one day, even... Return our money! Requesting backup near bank! What are you doing? Third Code: Suitcases It's almost 12:00. Let's count down. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1... Welcome to a prosperous future! What is this?! What's going on here? They're all old notes! Prime Minister, this is bad... If we don't override the deposit blockade now, these will all be useless! What did you do? Didn't I tell you? I got some help from the Printing Bureau. I had them move the contents of the suitcases so that only the top ones had new notes and the rest old. I did more than just change the three codes. If the old man won Final Judgment, he'd have his bribed officials swap the suitcases with the new currency for the old currency ones, and arrange for the codes to the entrance/exit and container to be changed. I knew from the Printing Bureau guys that the suitcases would be unlocked automatically at noon the next day. I only had to win once, and take the code to the suitcases to keep you from knowing that they contained the old yen. He's notorious for his entertainment RPS. You can't beat him! He didn't mean it! You two stay out of this. So was that whole thing a farce? Yes. Correct. Knowing that the code on the suitcases is automatically unlocked, you'd figure that in the worst case, you could do without that password. That's how I knew the code to the suitcases would be saved for the third round. And that's why I gambled on winning once for that third round. I don't understand. Why were you so insistent on simply letting them take the suitcases? News flash: The government has just formally commented that there is no evidence of a deposit blockade in place. This vicious hoax has caused so much social upheaval that the government has made it clear that it will not enforce the deposit blockade and... News Flash Information on deposit blockade implementation declared a hoax Kaiji is really something. I can't believe he dared to let them take away the suitcases for this. We can't just stop the deposit blockade and be done with it. We're gonna expose everyone who tried to get away while they're ahead. And with all that said... Time to upload the video! And now we have some new information. Take a look at this footage that was anonymously uploaded on a video site. What the hell is this? Inside are suitcases with piles of new bills in them. You don't have to tell us. Just open it. Prime Minister Shibusawa?! Sorry to keep you waiting. Please take these suitcases. Prime Minister... Hooray! How did this happen? You son of a bitch! What's wrong? Don't you hate violence? Go ahead, punch me. I dare you. Why would you do something so stupid? Don't you understand? All you've done is ruin this country. You'll sink it! You destroyed the only way for this country to survive and thrive! The only path to Japan's salvation... Go to hell! Japan's salvation? Yeah, right! All you've done is throw the weak to the wolves! It's those weaklings that are eating away at Japan. Pensions, medical bills, welfare... they are all burdens that are sinking the ship of Japan! We have no choice! Some sacrifices are inevitable! I will do everything in my power to save Japan for the next generation, even if it means spilling some blood now... You're crazy! Look. Look at that! You were trying to save those people, not Japan. We're Japan! An overwhelming majority of us are! If the general public isn't Japan, what is? We're all in the same boat! Why don't we share the pain together?! Don't get the wrong idea! I didn't want to let those guys get away unscathed! I was just using them! I used them to make an ideal choice, to get rid of unproductive people like you, and build a new Japan with my own hands... Stop being so prideful. Who the hell do you think you are? It's up to you to decide who and what to bet on. It's the people who have to gamble that decide. Just get it through your head. You've lost. Lost to the ants you were trying to destroy. Time to say goodbye. That was kinda fun. It made me feel so alive. Yep. I never thought people like us could dupe the elites. Thank you, Kaiji... You're so quick to cry, man. Bye! Alright, Kaiji, which one do you want? You worked the hardest, so you get to choose. Can I? I'll choose the biggest one, obviously! You really like money, huh, Kaiji? Like you don't. You just smiled! You look better when smiling. And kinda cute! Bye! So? What will you do from now on? I'll re-evaluate myself. I've spent my life resenting people and society. But starting now, I want to live my life differently. For my mother... and father's sake. I see. Kaiji. Thank you so much. So good! Excuse me! Another draft, please. Don't worry, I've got plenty of cash! Huh? What the hell? Sorry for the wait! Took you long enough. I'm sorry! So, Kaiji chose the big one, huh? Yeah! Hold it. You guys didn't think I was gonna tell you this for free, did you? I want my share too. But there's only just enough for all of us... You have Kaiji's share, don't you? Give his to me. In exchange, I'll give him a chance. Let him choose between a small and big suitcase when splitting the take. Just a little gamble with me. I gave him a chance and everything. What a greedy man. He sure is. Guess I've won this one. So, what about your share? I took it out of the suitcase last night and put it in this bag. Well, you don't have to worry about Kaiji. No other man is more fit for such a low life. Are you kidding me? What is all this? What's going on here? I got your draft. Here you go. Damn it. I don't care what happens now! I'll drink myself silly! It's ice-cold! Absolutely diabolical!
