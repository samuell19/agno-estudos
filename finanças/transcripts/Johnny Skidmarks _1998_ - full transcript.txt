It busted through here, and it came down here like this, just like this. It's a tragedy, really. There's four kids, and not one of 'em belted. Daddy does brain surgery on himself with the steering column. And mama, she flies through the windshield. Face smacks into this goddamn tree doing about 80. What the hell is that in the bark? Is that a tooth? Oh, for Christ sakes, that's a goddamn tooth. Get a snap of that, will you? That it? Yeah, that's it, Johnny. Thanks, man. Look, so the thing is we need this ASAP, okay, Scardino? - Sure. - No, no, no. Seriously, man, we need it ASAP, really. Look, the insurance agency wants to nip this thing in the bud before it gets out of hand. I got the whole extended family holding a vigil in the kiddie ward with the one survivor, and it looks like they're going to need beaucoup bucks just to hire someone to wipe his ass for the rest of his life. So, you know, I mean, that's why the agency sent us out here, you know, to put our finger in it. I mean, that's why we need this ASAP. Hey, Johnny... Scardino. Johnny, huh, ASAP? ASAP. Yeah, ASAP. You want me to say it? ASAP. Okay? ASAP. See you, buddy. We sure appreciate this, Johnny. I know it ain't your shift. Earl's been out for three days now with his stomach. His sister had one of them Hawaiian cookout fetes at her house on the weekend. What do you call 'em? Luau. That's right. Earl thinks the seafood was tainted. "Tainted." 15 pounds of shrimp sitting in the sun all day. I guess it better be tainted, or ain't fucking shrimp, huh? Ah, fat fuck probably had more than his share, anyway. Come on. Come on. Hey, hey! Come on, you guys. A little respect here, huh? - Yes, sir. - Sorry, Sarge. These guys. Got everything? That's it. Attaboy. Skidmarks. Washawski. Thanks, Woody. Yeah. That poor bastard. - Earl? - Huh? No, no, the stiff in there. Looks like a snuff, right? No. Guy croaked himself. We found the note and everything. - Hey, Larry. - I'm just playing it safe, gathering the necessary evidence, just in case. Jeez. Stick a fucking plastic bag on your head and just lie there? Even when the Mrs. And I broke up, never got that low. Got to have a lot of despair in your heart. That's what the guy's note said, he had despair in his heart. Yeah. Well, I... I don't really think about it. What, not ever? You got to think about it sometime, you know, fucking humanity of it all. I just take the pictures. You know, Johnny, you got a coldness in you, don't you? Johnny Skidmarks. - I'll see you. - See you. What's the story with that one? Don't know. What's that, drunk driver? Yeah, I guess. I don't know. Too contrasty. The neg was thin. Now, Mike, I told you to push it wide. 'Cause you want grain like beach balls? I like the look. You like the look? Pictures of dead people, you like the... I'll redo it. Have your beach balls. C-41. Push in one, both rolls. Oh, and I need it ASAP. ASAP. Man: Okay, I'll see you. So, anyway, you know, she's acting all weird and everything, so then I tell her. I mean, I lay it on her. I am an entrepreneur. You know, I own my own business. So bring her by here, show her the new lamps, and, you know, like, all of a sudden, her eyes are big as gold ingots, and it's so clear what she's really after, you know? So, you know, I don't know about this chick, but... Oh, how's your Happy Burger? Is that cola okay? - Fine, fine. - Good. You know why? I've been adjusting the syrup mix, you know. Too much seltzer, you know. Some people don't like the bubbles, but... yeah. So... you know, so yeah. So, anyway, how's everything with you, man? It's okay. - You know. - Great. Good. Yeah. Well, so haven't heard anything from her yet, but when I do... and I will... I'll just have to make it clear that I'm the kind of guy who you can't... Up bup bup bup. Better get this. Yeah, Burger Clown. Happy food for happy people. How may I help you? Yeah, I need some Funny Fries... Okay, 75 cents Funny Fries. $1.75 for your cheesecake.

So is it going to be the Delmonico or the Ticktock? What's the diff? Eh, Ticktock's got cable. Woman: Hurry back, sweetie. Don't you worry. Right on the button. She's an artist. There you are. Oh, thank you, kind sir. You're welcome. Don't you worry. I never worry. Hey. Hey, now, kid. Where you off to? I'll just be a sec. What?

Knock it off, or I'm going to call the cops! Man: No. Going to be a while before we can use the Delmonico again. Sloppy. Very sloppy. Johnny, what'd the guy look like when you was popping him? I don't know. What's with the fucking chain lock, Lorraine? I took it off. He put it back on. What can I say? Look, bitch, you got two fucking jobs, slip off the lock and make a tit sandwich out of the guy's head. Plus slipping your fat ass the key. Okay, three things. Plus sucking the guy's dick. Maybe next time you want to try it, huh, Walter? Hi, Johnny. Walter: Nighty night. Go fuck yourself, Walter. Pig! So do you want to come up? Oh, yes. I mean, every time, and every time I say the same thing. Once, you didn't. Well, maybe once is all the pleasure I can take. We could just be friends, you know. I've got a Trinitron. There's a video store that delivers. We don't... we don't have to do anything. Oh, I got to go. Yeah. Did you see him, Johnny? That guy wouldn't stop crying. I never look at them, Lorraine.

Mike: More dead people? Yeah. Ah, Johnny, sorry. Sorry about the table, man. She came in when I wasn't looking, you know. Otherwise, I'd have saved it for you. 'Cause, you know, you're a regular, and, I mean, we're friends, you know. - We're good friends. - It's okay, Jerry. They're pretty much all alike anyway. Yeah. Two tits and an ass, huh? Right? I meant the tables. Oh, yeah, sure. Yeah, they're all the same, yeah. Jesus! More customers. When it rains, you know. Do you mind taking care of yourself? Welcome to Burger Clown.

You want me to leave you alone? No. Anyone ever tell you you're a brilliant conversationalist? No. I read somewhere those things aren't good for you. Yeah, well, it's a trade-off kind of a thing. What for what? You got a name? Yeah. You? So, hey, man, how's the Happy... Oh. Anyway... Everything's all right, Jerry. Boy, God. A guy can't get a moment's rest around here. He's... interesting. Former brother-in-law. You just can't quite let go. Hmm. Your wife. Jerry needs the business. What brings you here? Big clown out front. I like clowns. No, I just needed a cup of coffee. Coffee is very important to me these days. Coffee and cigarettes. Which step are you at? You want to see my place? You're rich. Trust fund. "Hey, sorry. Did that hurt?" Motherfucker says, "Yes."

His color's come back. Yoo-hoo, Earl! How's your tummy, sweetheart? Oh! Yeah, Earl's stomach thing really got out of hand. His wife had to put him in the fucking hospital for a few days. Fucking nightmare. Well, listen, I wanted to tell you... Remember that horrible freeway we covered the other night? The limo, the Jap car, and the truckload of bean pickers? Yeah, out on Highway 6. Yeah, turns out it wasn't an accident. Somebody cut the brake lines on the limo. We got it over in Homicide now. Turns out the rich old coot who owned the car, yeah, he was some big-shot nuts-and-bolts guy. 90 fucking years old, and someone still can't wait for him to croak.

Remind me not to drink from the tap the next few days. Jesus. Cuts right through, don't it? Yeah, you never get used to it. Larry: Go on, Doc. Ah, cigarette burns. Psycho? Someone looking for information. Give me a hand. Ah, Jesus. What'd they do to his face? Just some bad surgery, probably when he was a kid. Ernie the Wheel. Who? His name's Ernie Deemo. He's a driver. He's been in and out of the hole ever since he was a fucking kid. Jesus. Who'd want to kill poor Ernie? He was nothing. Mob guys. Probably did us a favor. Yeah, I guess. Take a snap, Johnny. This one goes in the ugly file. Hey, Helen, it's Johnny. Let me talk to Walter. Huh? Has he called in? Well, tell him... tell him to give me a ring when he gets in. It's important. All right. Bye-bye. Johnny! What the fuck are you doing? I was looking for the bedroom. How 'bout ringing the doorbell first? I didn't want anyone to see me. Lorraine and Ernie are dead, Johnny. I know. They killed Lorraine and Ernie. They left burn marks on Ernie's ass. They tortured him. They're killing everybody, the whole fucking crew, and we're next, man. We're next. Somebody's onto us, Johnny. We're dead. We're fucking dead. Maybe it was a coincidence. Ernie ran with mob guys. Who knows who he might have pissed off? He was an imbecile, Walter. And Lorraine, Jesus, they weren't after her. They were after her john, some big muckety-muck in the nuts-and-bolts racket. These are explainable things, Walter. No, no, no. You got it wrong, Johnny. They was murdered. I'm in the business. I know. One of our pigeons coming after us, I tell you. How many pigeons were they? I don't know. How many times we do the thing? How many pigeons? How many pigeons? I don't know. I got to find Lammings. - Who? - Lammings. Lammings. You met him the other day in the office. He'll know what to do. He's got the juice... courts, cops, juries. He's a made guy. I got to go. So do you remember that chick that took your table the other night? Yeah. Yeah. Well... when I came out from the back, you were gone. You were both gone. So? Well, then the next day, she came back. She started asking me questions about you. So? So I don't know. I mean, you know, I just... So? Hello. You've reached the office of Walter Lippinscott Jr. No one's available to take your call right now. If you leave your... Something wrong, man? Don't know. - Scardino. - Hey, Anne. Well, you ain't going to believe this. Wake up, Sleeping Beauty. You're a piece of work, Scardino. Oh, what happened? Well, you tossed your cookies all over the goddamn crime scene, that's what. Look, what'd you have for lunch, anyways? My stuff. Don't worry about it, Johnny. We brought in Tom Brini. College kid? Well, he's no Johnny Skidmarks. - I'll grant you that. - Here you go, sir. At least he ain't blowing lunch every time he sees a fucking used rubber. Hey, come on, Woody. Happens to everybody. Guy just found his limit, that's all. Last couple days would have been tough on any civilian. Had car crashes, mob hits, satanic sacrifices. Satanic sacrifices? What? Who you think cut up the guy in the hole back there? Like, fucking Santa's little helpers? It's ritualistic homicide. Cult types, John. Usually confine their aggression to barnyard animals. Ah, the humanity. As if there wasn't enough evil on God's fucking Earth, huh? All right, let's go, Skovik. He's fine. Yeah, yeah. In a minute. Go home, John. Take some time off. Every man's got his limit. Help! Johnny! Hi. Come here. Well, am I wonderful or what? I don't know what possessed me. I just woke up this morning, looked around, thought, "Fuck it. I'm moving in." I need to talk to you. You've got something, but you slept with me anyway. Then I forgive you. I'm the girl in the glass house, remember? Can help me if you want. It's kind of interesting. It's like getting presents from your great-aunt in Florida. I mean, you're happy she sent them, but you dread what's inside. Who is this? Me and my folks. Why? I better go. Hey, what's up? Hey, Jerry. What's wrong? Well... it's nothing, really. Well, good. Can I get a cup of coffee? What is it? Well, it's just... I guess she's your new best friend now, so... Who? You know. That chick, you know. Alice? Well, I don't know her name. I mean, you know, it's not like you been coming around here since, you know. You know. Jerry, I was just here the other night. Yeah, well... I mean, you were married to my sister, I mean, you know, before. - Yeah. - Yeah. I introduced you. Yeah. Yeah, well, I just think you ought to remember who your real friends are, that's all. I mean, you know, when Ruth died and you got all weird, you know, I didn't turn my back on you. I let you come in here and hang out, you know, even though it obviously keeps the customers away. And now it's like, oh, you meet this new girl who, you know, in a way, I introduce you to, 'cause it was, you know, in Burger Clown! Which is my place! And now you fuck me. Don't fuck me, Johnny! I don't sit around moping about who my friends are. I just get even, okay? Okay. Good. Now I'll get your Happy Burger. Hey, John. Sit down. Join us. We're celebrating the end of this pig-fuck week. - Woody. - Yeah. Everything okay? I don't know, Larry. Looks a little pale, don't he? Hey, Skidmarks, you been dating Earl's sister? Hey, come on, Woody. When are you going to let up, huh? Got a phone call for you, Woody. I think it's your wife. Jesus. So is everything okay? No. You can tell me about it, you know. I mean, anything, business, personal, whatever. All right. Ladies and gentlemen of the press, thank you for coming. I have arranged this press conference to confront a vicious and entirely unsubstantiated rumor concerning my behavior as a member of the California State Senate. John? Can you hand me those benches down there? I would like to take this opportunity... - Rick, turn it up. - to deny any and all - wrongdoing on my part. - Turn it up! That's as loud as she goes, Johnny. An extramarital affair with anyone who is not my wife. Kitty and I have been married... Whoa there. Johnny. Louie. That I have never, to the best of my knowledge, been anything less than faithful to her. I plan to continue along the noble, cherished path that is monogamy. My wife and I stand... So... you're home. How'd you get in? The door was open. How'd you find me? Looked in the phone book. Well, look, I... I really can't talk right now. What's wrong with you? Nothing. Look, I'm holding my own here trying to stay on track, and I don't need you fucking with my life. Fine. I left you something. Do what you want with it. Whoo!

His name's Walter, Walter Lippinscott. Lippinscott. The chopped-up stiff in the crater? The cult job? I-I don't know where to start. Well, Walter Lippinscott hired me... to take pictures of... guys in bed with a hooker named Lorraine. Um... I would bust in on 'em when they were going at it, and... Oh, Johnny. I took the pictures. That's all. That's all. No, I just took the pictures. Okay. Okay. So Lippinscott had a blackmail scam going. You were the hired lens. So go on. Everybody in the crew has been turning up dead. There's a woman I met around the time everything started happening, and, man... God, I can't be sure, but I... I think her father may be one of the pigeons. I mean one of the big shots that I took pictures of and then... But I... I mean, he looks like he could be. But I don't know. I don't know. She's unstable. Recently out of detox, and talk about unstable. Jerry is... Wait. Jerry? All I know is everybody's dead... except me. And... you know, there's this woman in my apartment, and I found Walter's head in my freezer. Johnny... Lippinscott's body parts are in the city morgue. I mean, she'd need a court order signed by a judge. The only one who could have pulled something like this off would be... Jesus, a cop. A cop. It could be a cop. It could be a fucking cop. Oh, Jesus. Washawski? Larry, do you think... Larry, you think it could be Washawski? Ah, Johnny, you're a funny one. Yeah, I wish you'd have come to me sooner, John. Maybe you could have saved your little blackmailing buddies. Nah, fuck it. It's hard to say. I mean, they were a pretty bad bunch, right, bad people. They stunk of badness. Johnny, when I got up close, oh, the stink was so bad, Jesus. All the Aqua Blue in the world couldn't wash it away. And, you know, I mean, that was before I killed 'em. But you, John... yours is the baddest stink of all. When's the last time you voted? Last time? Yeah, ballpark. When? Never, right? Am I right? The last time you walked past some homeless guy in the street. He's destitute, he's pathetic, he's broken, sure, but a creature of God's fucking Earth nonetheless. What did you do? Did you befriend him? Did you give him a buck, huh? You didn't do anything, did you? You just walk on by. You looked, but you did not see. You did not see the humanity before you, and that's... That's the whole thing with you and your whole generation, isn't it, John? You look, but you do not see. You've lost the ability to feel. You don't care about people! I was right there in front of you, John. I was naked on my hands and knees. I was calling you out by name, and you never saw me. You never heard me. You just kept snapping your fucking pictures. Every day for a year after, I kept looking for some sign, some little bit of recognition from you. But you never fucking saw me. My good pal Johnny. Oh, sure, blackmailing a guy like me is no big deal, right? Yeah, force him to go up on the stand and sing a crooked tune for Lamming's wiseguys, you know. Rob him of his self-respect. Destroy 20 years of marriage to a decent, boring wife. I mean, it's cheaper than buying a judge, isn't it, Johnny? How many harmless men out for a little fun have you destroyed? You know, John, I'm nothing much... just a dumb cop in a tragic, dirty town. Okay, smart enough to ferret out you and your buddies, but, I mean, still just a cop. But an honest cop until you took even that away from me. But I saw... What'd you say? Oh, God, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Take my hand, John. Come on, take it. I want us to pray together. Pray? Yeah. Pray. You know the Lord has his uses for everyone, John, and I've come to realize that his use for me is to bring forth a special message to you and your entire generation. It is a message as old and quaint as time itself, sent from Heaven on a carriage of a thousand wings. Please, Larry. By the way, John, I lied. I don't want to pray with you. Stop! Stop! - No! No! - Open your eyes. Open your eyes, John. Feel the humanity. Feel the humanity. Feel the fucking humanity! Ah, God! Johnny! Go ahead, Johnny. Shoot me. Pull the trigger. Do something with your life. Sergeant Skovik. Is everything all right? Nothing to worry about, Mrs. Starkey. Cat got out, is all. Jerry? Jerry. Johnny. Ow! What happened? Did you have an accident? - Yeah. - Oh, man. That's what I was gonna say, 'cause you look terrible. I got something in my eye, Jerry. Okay. Okay. All right. All right. I'm calling 9111. No. No, please. Okay. Just some tweezers, Jer. Tweezers. Oh, I don't have any tweezers. Johnny... oh, wait. I got some pliers in the back. - Okay. - Okay. Yeah. Just keep on... Oh, Christ. Ow! Yeah, that's right. Burger Clown on the northeast corner. And just ask for Jerry, and I'll be... Oh. - Johnny. - Yeah? - Are you okay, man? - Yeah. Okay, now listen.
