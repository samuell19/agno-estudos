You know, I went this morning. Got him a red boat. It's got this nice little sail on it. Should we do this? Oh, yeah. You want to blow that out? Happy birthday, Lucas. You know... ...guys at the precinct are supposed to see a shrink every now and then. I could ask for a recommendation. You can call me anytime. Take care of yourself, Claire. Effective immediately, your children will be placed in foster care until the requirements the court has requested have been met. You will not have visiting privileges. If you do not agree with the court's decision, you can appeal in six months from today's date. Your Honor, if I may. Ms. Diaz works three part-time jobs, she's a single parent, she's been diagnosed with depression. Taking her children away completely will only inhibit her ability to improve. Ms. Yang, you have provided substantial evidence against Ms. Diaz concerning her negligence of her children. Are you recanting the statements that you've made in this court? No, Your Honor. But I wouldn't want to deny her of her visiting privileges. I'm saying this, Your Honor... ...I'm saying it as a mother. Okay, I really appreciate it. Thanks a lot for the call. Close the door. Don't ever question the judge's decision again. Look, I've got an 8-year-old girl. School wants us to look into it. Mm, okay, I'll go first. Dewey. - Dewey? - Dewey. Are you kidding? Yeah, he's Donald Duck's nephew. He's the one... he's the blue one. I'm not gonna name our son after a cartoon duck. Okay, fair enough. Oh, I got it. How about, um, Peter Jr.? Mm. No, I think one of you is enough. Lucas. - Lucas. - Yeah. Lucas. You sure? Yeah, it sounds right. I just like it. I think it's a great name. ♪ Bring back my Bonnie to me ♪ Happy birthday, honey. I thought you weren't going to come home. I'd wait up for you. I'd wait up for you. Don't leave me! Look what you made me do. Look what you made me do! What? No. No, just... just set the meeting for tomorrow, okay? I-I need this to come in before the end of the quarter. Audrey, can... can you get that, please? Yeah, yeah. Audrey, c... Hold on. Hold on one second. Whatever you're selling, um, we're not interested. Thanks. I'm Claire... from Child Protective Services. I'm gonna call you back. Come in. Audrey, CPS is here. Can you get Sophie? Dinner's ready. Have a seat. What time does she normally go to bed? Um, around 9:00. Do you tuck her in? Uh, she prefers her dad. What do you do, Mr. Lang? I work at a mortgage company. And you, Mrs. Lang? Oh, me? Um, I'm at a travel agency, just part time. Uh, Audrey hasn't worked since we've had Sophie, but now that Sophie's older, we thought a job would get her out of the house more often. I get to spend a few hours a day with the real world. The scratch on her cheek... what happened? She fell off her skateboard in the driveway. I'll need to speak with Sophie alone. It'll just be a moment. Sure. I never liked cauliflower, too. Are you here to take me away? Oh, no. No, I'm here to help. There's a girl at my school. Her name's Jalen. Your friend? No. She had to go to a foster home. What happened to your cheek? I fell. What about the bruises from last week? Why don't you try skateboarding? You'll find out. I'll tell you two truths... and one lie. If you can't tell the lie, you have to eat one. The girls at my school used to make me do things I didn't want to do because I wanted to fit in. I'd go home and cry for hours. This must be a stupid game you play with your kids. I used to play it with my son. Yesterday was his birthday. We went to his favorite restaurant to celebrate. I'm always afraid. So I sleep in the closet. Only Harry Potter sleeps in the closet. That's a lie. Mnh-mnh. Yesterday would have been my son's 10th birthday. I'm sorry. What wa his name? Lucas. That was very brave. Your turn. I'm allergic to peanuts. Almost died the first time I tried a Reese's Cup. In the second grade, I blamed a fart on this bully. Kids at school still call him Fart Back Fred. The scratch on my face... It's okay. You can tell me. I didn't get it from a fall. Hey! You okay? We don't know what it is. When we first moved in, lights would turn on and off. I just thought it was an electrical problem, but then, things... furniture started moving on their own. We thought it was harmless. But then she started hurting your daughter. Wait, how do you know it's a woman? I can't take this case. This is Claire. Hi, Claire. Um, I was thinking, uh, maybe we could grab dinner sometime together. Claire, are you still there? Yeah. So is that a yes? No, no, I'm working late. Oh, yeah. Okay. Well, maybe... maybe next time. What time is Daddy coming? You just worry about finishing that chapter. I don't get this word. Sound it out. Glory... gloriump... Gloriumptious. Gloriumptious. Are you hungry? Yeah. Can we go get tacos? Hmm. Sounds good. Let me get my keys. Why does Daddy have to work on a Saturday? I don't know. Can you put on your shoes? Mom? Mom, what are you looking at? Mom! Mom? Are you okay? Hey. Got something to eat? I'm starving. Haven't had anything for days. I told you I wanted something to eat! Hello, this is Claire. Are you the CPS worker for Sophie Lang? I am no longer on her case. You're still listed as the CPS contact. We need someone here at the school immediately. I'll see what I can do. Can I get the Lang case back? Changed your mind? Yeah. You think that I'm hurting my own child? How many times can she fall off her skateboard? She wasn't wearing her helmet or her pads. Mrs. Lang, I am recommending Sophie to the child psychiatrist here at school. There will also be weekly and random visits by the CPS. Meantime, I suggest you and Mr. Lang seek counseling. If you need a recommendation, I know a few family and marriage therapists. We only want to create a healthy environment for your child. We bought this house the year we had Sophie. It was the first time it had snowed in 30 years. I remember thinking to myself... remember seeing the snow outside the window in the delivery room and just being alone, thinking, "God, what a perfect moment to bring a child into this world." Are you a mother, too? Yes. I was. I'm so sorry. I... Audrey, you have to do everything you can to protect your daughter. I am. I don't know what else to do. Sell the house. I can't. Everything we have is tied into this mortgage. You said it was a woman, right? How did you know that? I saw her. And I felt her. You felt her? What does that mean? I don't know how to explain it without sounding crazy. I see things that people aren't supposed to see. Do they hurt you? Sometimes. Sorry for, uh, coming by without calling first. What's that? Oh, I, uh, found some of your things in my storage. Thought you might like to have them back. No, your hand. Oh, a toolbox fell on it. And there's, um... there's something that's been bugging me. I've been... I've been driving around every night thinking about this. Do you remember our first date? Roberta's Café. I left $13 for the tip. That was all I had... $13. I drove across town the next morning just to give the waitress a few more dollars. Why would you do that? Somehow, I thought you'd be the one. And I, uh, didn't want to start us off with bad luck. Anyway, it's just, uh, something I never told you, so... Did you want to have dinner sometime? Sure. Yeah. Goodnight. Goodnight. Not afraid of you! Just leave us alone! Just give me back my daughter! We have walnut, mahogany, cherry, oak, pine, pecan. If you want a metal casket, we also have a wide selection with bronze and copper accents. Uh, yeah. What about, uh, that one there? Oh, that's a popular one. Uh, comes with a nice velvet lining. Uh, you can also choose the color. The package also comes with flowers. We work closely with our local florist to give you the best selection. You can go with lilies, carnations, chrysanthemums, orchids, roses. Our prices are competitive, so you probably won't find a better deal in town. Well, I'll give you two a moment to decide. So, um, what do you think? White lilies. Okay. The casket? Any of the wood ones. Yeah. I was thinking the same, too. How about, uh, pine? Were you able to decide? Yeah. Uh, we'll with the, um, wooden casket, pine. Well, that's a good choice. And, uh... for the flowers, um, we'll go with, uh, white lilies. What about the casket lining? I-If you need more time, you can take our catalogue, look it through, and... and call me back. But we do close 5:00 on weekdays. Yeah, my dad wants to have another kid. But my mom doesn't want to. What about you? Do you want another brother or sister? Sometimes I do. Sometimes I don't. Do you want to have another child? Are you a good mother? I don't know. How long is a person sad for when they lose someone? A very long time. When my son died... ...all I wanted was for the world to leave me alone. I even stopped talking to his daddy. Did he leave you? Sometimes when people are too sad to be together... ...it's better that they stay apart. I wish my parents could be happy together. Why would you say that? My dad slept with another woman while my mom had me. She never got over it. Is it true you can see ghosts? How long has it been hurting you? I need you to close the Lang case. - Sir... - I don't get it. You've never taken this long on a case. - I don't think it's the parents. - Well, the school does, and... and they've already reported that there's no bullying. I don't want to have another conversation with the principal. The school has no idea what is going on. It's not your job to decide who's right or wrong, okay? You just collect data, and we process it. I need a few more days. File the report. Are we always going to eat without talking? Well, what do you want to talk about? I don't know. Just anything. Don't you want to know about my day? Okay, Giles, how was your day? Well, Audrey, thanks for asking. It was good. I closed a loan on another commercial property. Congratulations. And you? Fine. How was your day? How... How's work going for you? What do you expect? I work at a travel agency. How about you, young lady? How was school? Boring. You're too young for school to be boring. Come on. Dad, can I go to my room? Finish your food first. Anyway, I'm thinking about, you know, putting the housing market. And why would you do that? I don't know. Just with everything that's going on, I thought it would be easier on all of us. Oh, is that... Is that how this works? Really? Giles, any time we just hit a wall, you... you just hit the reset button? Would you stop it?! Look, I don't care how this looks anymore, okay? We... We... We got to do something about this. We are taking you to the hospital. Come on, let's go. Audrey. Audrey. Did you ever bring her into our house? What? W-What are you talking about? Did you fuck her on our bed? Oh, my God. I... Baby, I thought... I thought we were over this. Audrey? Sorry for the late call. Is everything alright? Yeah. Yeah, no, it is. It's, um... Actually, no. Look, I need your help. It's gotten... It's gotten more violent. And I was thinking, you know, if you can... if you can see it... ...then maybe there's a chance you can communicate with it. I don't know if I can. You could try. Please. You could try because there's no one else who can help us. No one. I'll try. Ma'am, do you have a parking permit? Yes, it's on the rear window. Can I see your license and registration? What day is today? What day is today?! Aah! What happened to my hand?! What happened to my hand?! I'm supposed to be at my daughter's recital. It's tonight. What am I even doing here?! Did you do this to me? Did you do this to me?! What day is today? What day is today?! What day is today? What day is today? Lucas? Did you know that 70% of the Earth is ocean? Yes. Do you know what to do when you're in the middle of a storm? No. You have to push against the waves. That's the only way to get out. If you don't, you'll sink. I'm so sorry. When you're sad, it makes me sad. I miss you so much. Sometimes... I get so cold. Mom? Hi, honey. How are you? Your shift ended three hours ago. I just kept driving. I needed to... well, think. I missed you. I'm gonna go for a walk. How's the hand? It'll heal. Uh-huh. I put your pain pills in the cabinet. Why don't... Why don't you take off tomorrow? And I will to. I don't know. No. No, I'll be fine. You've been talking to that CPS lady, right? Um... it was, uh, Claire. Right? Audrey? This is really good. How'd you get the chicken so tender? Costco. Costco. And the potato? I baked them. Do you want some more wine? Sure. Thank you. Do you regret going back to tip that waitress? Why? Because we're unlucky. I took the third shift because I can't sleep at night. I don't even have dreams about him. Do you? Don't, Peter. We're just... We're just never gonna talk about it? You... You won't understand. This is not just about our son. It's like you have these walls around you. You know, there's no windows, no door, and I'm always trying to find a way in. I'm sorry you feel that way. No, Claire, you are notsorry. No, no, we are not... We are not done with this conversation, Claire. Okay? You're not just walking away again! What do you do with all the damage, right? How do you hold it all in? Because I can't do that. Please let go of me. What do you do with all the... the hurt and the anger, Claire? Don't pretend like you don't feel anything. Do you want to know how I got this? I got called on a 415. Okay? Some drunk raped his stepdaughter. He didn't resist. Okay? He complied, but I lost it. Do you know how hard you have to hit a man to break his jaw in three different places? Don't you have anything to say to me?! Do... Do you want me around? Or you... Or you don't want me around? Do you want a divorce? Just... Just tell me something! Just anything! Anything! I-I can't live in the gray with you! Do... Do you even still love me? - I think you're a coward. - Mm... Yes. I am a coward. Is that what you want to hear? I killed our son, Peter. Our son. I bury myself with the same scenarios you play in your head. What if you had picked him up instead? What if I had just called the school? What if he had stayed there just a little longer?! What if I hadn't taken those pills?! Yeah. Yeah. Claire. Why do you take those pills? When you're ready to tell me, I may not be here for it. So you've never done this before, right? No. - What if this doesn't work? - How do we know? Well, if it can do this to your hand, - what else can it do? - Giles, just let her try. - Should... Should we follow her? - No, no, no. Just stay. You have to go. You have to leave. You have to leave Sophie alone. - Claire? - Audrey, call 911 now. Claire. How long have I been here? You've only been here for a night. How did you know I was here? Well, I'm still listed as your emergency contact. Hey, hey. Let me help you. No, no. I'm okay. Got it. Um... do you... Do you need anything? No. I'm alright. Well... I'll... I'll be... I'll be outside if you need anything. Okay. Your husband? Yeah. Nice fella. He's been sitting here all this time just watching you sleep. I'm Ada. I can tell a lot about a couple by just listening to them. Sometimes we just have to stop pushing people out of our lives. Maybe. But it's not that easy. Oh, nobody ever said it was easy. Doesn't mean you don't try. Sometimes you can't live with things you can't change. Oh, girl. Had I learned not to beat myself every day for the things I couldn't change then I'd look 20 years younger now. It's not the burdens we carry that makes life hard. It's the refusal to let anybody else help us carry them. When my husband took his own life, I blamed myself. I'd been working two jobs. You come home to see the person you love dead. That's a place you don't climb out of. I blamed myself. Took me a long time to realize it wasn't my fault. I was afraid to accept my own life. Just because shit's bad doesn't mean things can't get better. Do you hear that crying? That's my baby. My baby! My baby. My baby. My... I can stand. I can finally walk. Ada. How long have I been here? I don't know. My son was supposed to pick me up. I'm so sorry. Maybe you don't have to be here anymore. Maybe you have a choice. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Hey, Claire, this is Lloyd. The school has filed a formal complaint with the city. I need you to close the Lang case immediately. I'll see you back at the office. The other day I was making dinner. And one moment, I was in the kitchen cutting vegetables, and the next, I was already out the front door walking. I just kept walking. I could have gone on forever. Anyway, yeah, Giles and I were high school sweethearts. We did the whole thing, you know? We went to college together, we got married, moved to the suburbs, and I got pregnant with Sophie. When I was pregnant, he... he was away a lot. With another woman. Sophie told me. He loves our daughter. He really does. That's the only reason he came back. Oh, God. I had this dream of what my life would be like. Do you have any idea what it's like to have no control over your entire life? I do. Sometimes the only way to make them go away is when I'm medicated. And that day... ...I had taken more than I should. I passed out. My son... He decided to walk home from school. Police thought he was kidnapped. It took us three days to find him in an empty field on the side of the road. It was a hit and run. And we never found the driver. So I know what it's like to not know where to put the blame. What do you do with it? You learn to live in its shadow. You're going to lose your daughter. Remember when I told you I was only here to help? I have to make sure you stay safe. No, pick a number. Six. One, two, three, four... Sophie, go stand outside. Now. They're gonna take her. But I haven't even filed the case. The hearing is next week. Please, Claire, don't you think you can just tell them the truth? I-I can't. I... You filed my case? I had to. I was handling it. Claire, you passed out on the job. You've been in the hospital for two days. And I don't know what's... Why are you taking so long with this one? Besides, the school called again. So I did what needed to be done. Look, it is not good for the girl. If anything happened to that child, we could be charged with negligence. Please, Lloyd, listen to me. Please do not do this. Look... I was gonna wait till the end of the day, but I guess... I should tell you now. I'm letting you go. Oh, baby. Where have you been, Mommy? I'm sorry. I'm sorry, honey. I'm here now. I'm here. Sometimes I get really cold. I get really scared. Me too. I get scared too, honey. Maybe... Maybe it's time we stop being scared. ♪ My Bonnie lies over the years ♪ ♪ My Bonnie lies over the sea ♪ ♪ My Bonnie lies over the ocean ♪ ♪ Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me ♪ ♪ Bring back, bring back ♪ ♪ Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me, to me ♪ ♪ Bring back, bring back ♪ ♪ Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me ♪ Hold these. I got to take this call. Sure, man. Hi. I wanted to ask you something. Okay. Were you ever prepared to leave? You can be honest. No, no. I wouldn't know how. Claire? I want to tell you everything. Everything? I want us to start over. Hey, Pete. You okay, man? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I'd... I'd like that. If you want to come over... ...that'll be okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. It's too late. Shut up! Baby, please. All these years, I tried to make it work. I know, okay, and it's all my fault. Okay, we can make it, but... no, I... I will make it better. - Please. - Audrey. What are you doing here? It doesn't have to be this way. Just put the gun down. I know what it feels like. I know what it feels like to feel something so wrong can never be right. You can still make this right. Audrey, you're sick, honey. - No! - No, baby... No, you did this! We can... We'll get you help. - No. - Honey, we will get you help. You took away the one thing in this world that I wanted most. A life. And once you lose that, you can't ever get it back. - Baby, what are... - I am tired of pretending. What... What are you talking about, honey? You know Sophie's bruises never go away? It was you? How could you hit her? - Do you feel that? - How could you touch her? Do you know how much it takes for a mother to hurt her own child? Do you? Do you feel that? Good. 'Cause now you know how I feel, and now you know my pain. And now... I have to take away the one thing in this world that you love most. Oh, no, God, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, Sophie, baby, I'm sorry about this. - Okay? - No. - It'll be so quick, honey. - No, Mommy, no. - Yes, baby. - No, Mommy. - Take me. - Mommy's gonna do you first. - No! - Shh. And then it'll be me and it'll be so much better this way. - I swear. - No, Mommy! - I swear. - Stop it! No! No! He was supposed to suffer! You did this. You took this from me! Oh, no. Sophie. Are you okay? Let me just check you. Okay. Okay. It's gonna be okay. I took $500 off the boys with hold 'em the other night. You should come by, come by Jim's one of these games. Take it easy on you. Uh-huh. I heard you lost $1,000 the other week. You know, you got to let the suckers think they can win once in a while. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Sounds like you have an addiction. Addicted to winning. We got a 10-71, multiple shots fired at a local residence on Crawford and Third. This is Officer Yang and Officer Beckett. We're on our way. Listen to me. We have to get out of here. You stay behind me, okay? Okay, Sophie, let's run to the door. Run, Sophie. Run. Sophie. Sophie... Sophie, get out of here. Get out of here. Get out of here, Sophie. Run. Get out of here now. Claire, you should have stayed out of it. You think you can fix us? All I needed was you to get rid of that fucking ghost. Help us. You have to help us. Help us. Help? Who's gonna help you? I got her. It's okay, it's okay. Everything's gonna be okay. Requesting 11-41. Female, non-responsive. What the...? Claire. Requesting 10-52 to 456 South Crawford. 456 South Crawford. Claire. Beckett! In the kitchen, Beckett! Claire. No, no, no. It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry for pushing you away. For everything. I understand now. How long have you had it? All my life. Why didn't you tell me before? I was afraid you wouldn't believe me. We heard that you may be able to help us. After the funeral, we started to hear sounds and the lights would flicker. People don't want to believe. How often do you... do you see them? All the time. My mom, she was really attached to this house. And... She was always really worried that I wouldn't be able to take care of myself, to raise a family. It's like they're stuck. Holding onto their pain. Reliving their past over and over. If she's still here, can you connect with her? What do they want? Someone to help them.
