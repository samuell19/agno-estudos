DIGITALLY RESTORED IN 2017 BRINK OF LIFE ACCIDENT AND EMERGENCY ADMISSIONS You may come in now. I'm Mr. Ellius. I spoke with Dr. Carlsson by phone 30 minutes ago. He said to call an ambulance and come in immediately. - Your wife is bleeding? - Yes. - I'm Nurse Marie. - Mrs. Ellius. - How are you feeling? - It really hurts. Does it feel like labor pains? The pain comes and goes. And I'm bleeding. The doctor will see you soon. Please sit down and wait. Be a brave girl and all will be fine. I'll be here whenever you need me. Remember, Cissi: "Ellius expects his wife to do her duty." Do you really want this baby, Anders? I have to know. I didn't want to before, but now I must know! There's nothing you or I can do about it right now. The doctors will do everything they can. If it's humanly possible to save the baby, it will be saved. Just place yourself in the doctors' hands like a parcel. A large parcel with a smaller one inside. Stay calm, Cissi. Everything will be fine. Your date of birth, please? March 20, 1930. Full name and maiden name? Kristina Cecilia Ellius, née Lindgren. Address and telephone? Cederdalsgatan 23. Telephone 20-18-79. Occupation? I work for the Board of Education. You can put "secretary." What day did your last period start? I can't remember right now. When the doctor said to hurry... The doctor will see you as soon as he can. We have to get you admitted first. June 27. - So you're in your third month? - Yes. The doctor's on his way. Ring if you need anything. Nurse! I'm losing the baby! - How's it look, Doctor? - We're giving you an anesthetic now. I mean... how is the baby? I want to know exactly. But I already know. I lost the baby. Yes. I'm sorry. But coming in earlier still wouldn't have helped. Something was wrong from the start. I understand. Could you tell what it would have been? No, it's impossible to say. Get some sleep now. We're going to do a D&C. To make it neat and tidy for next time. I don't think there'll be a next... The poor thing's in pain. I wonder if she knows yet. No need to pity her. She has it made now. Dear God, what should we do? Let's move you down a bit. The anesthetic hasn't worn off yet. Good morning. I'm Nurse Brita. You may feel nauseous, but it'll pass in an hour or two. It was wrong from the start. There should never have been any baby. You needn't say anything. I already know. You needn't console me. I don't need consoling right now. But I have to say this: I see clearly now. I've never seen anything so clearly in all my life. That baby wasn't wanted, you see. Its father didn't want it and its mother wasn't strong enough to love it on her own. That's why it couldn't be born... and just had to be flushed down the sink... or put in a jar for scientific purposes. I know. I've heard about such things. You've flushed away what would have been my baby. Serves me right. I wasn't strong enough. I didn't love it enough. No, don't go. You have to listen to me. I don't usually say much, but now I have to speak. I don't feel ill. I see with total clarity now. Such utter, astonishing clarity. I've always known... that I wouldn't be good enough, either as wife or as mother. Maybe some people are predestined not to be good enough. Don't you think so, nurse? And they know it from the start. I didn't see it as clearly as I do now. But now I think I've always known. When I found out I was pregnant, I couldn't really be happy. Something deep inside told me... that this baby would never be born. I knew that Anders didn't love me. He never said it, of course. He'd never say such a thing. But I could see it in his eyes... when I told him we were going to have a baby. It was nothing. It can't be anything. It's over now. And I won't die of grief either. I'll eat and laugh and sleep again. I've already been sleeping and laughing. Everyone will be so nice to me now, with flowers and books. I'm just that type, you see. I have my colleagues and my work and my friends and lots of lovely things. I do such beautiful embroidery! I'll have all that back as soon as I get out of here. Everything's so different here. I can feel it. People act differently in here than out there. Even I do. Poor, frightened little Cecilia Ellius. Perhaps it's not just the womb that opens up here... but the entire person. I'll never forget this moment. So close... I'll never get so close to life again. At least it ran through my hands, through my womb. But like water... like water that leaves no tracks. My mother always did this. It might not help much, but it feels nice. My mother did that too. It does feel nice. - Feel better now? - Much better. It must be the anesthetic. It probably hasn't worn off yet. I must have talked up a storm. I have no idea how I got in this bed. - You were like a floppy doll. - A floppy doll... Sorry. I shouldn't be so forward. Why not? My name's Cecilia. - I'm Stina. That's Hjördis over there. Your husband will be here any minute. Visitors aren't allowed during the day, but Nurse Brita made an exception. Hjördis and I could go out for a walk, if you like. That's not necessary. It would be better if I could cry. You were crying in your sleep. You just didn't know it. Tears streamed down your cheeks. I felt so sorry for you. I'm sure a lot has happened that I don't know about. Yet oddly enough it feels as if I've known all along. - Known what? - That the baby wouldn't make it. It's not uncommon the first time. It means nothing for the future. It happened to my mom the first time, but then everything went fine. She practically danced them out. Seven babies in nine years. I'll never have any more. - How are you feeling? - Better, thanks. Mr. Ellius will be here soon. How long will I have to stay? Three or four days, I should think. Nurse Brita, the diapers are all ready. If we postponed your delivery a bit, all the linen would be in perfect order. But it's against the rules. Patients aren't to be working. I need something to do! This boy who won't come out is getting on my nerves. - We'll call it "therapy" then. - Sounds awful fancy. Just something to keep you from climbing the walls. That would never do! That's what I thought. - What can we bring you, Mrs. Ellius? - Nothing, thank you. Yes, have a nice cup of tea or some soup. - He's here. - Your husband's here. Set up the screen, please. Hello. Thank you. - Very kind of you. - It's not "kind," Cissi. - Isn't it kind? - You talk as if to a stranger. Haven't you always treated me kindly, like a stranger to be kept at a distance? Please don't contradict me. Let me say what I want to say. I can only say it here and now. Thank you, nurse. Won't you have some tea? I'll try. I won't contradict you. Say what you need to. Just don't tire yourself out. I wanted to tell you that I know you don't love me. Cissi dear, can't this wait... You weren't happy about the baby. You're tired and upset. Be sensible, now. I've always been sensible and well-behaved. I wish we'd shouted sometimes... - Cissi, I beg you. Perhaps you imagined at some point that you loved me. Then we got married, and you were too considerate to tell me it was a mistake. And when did you realize this mistake, if I may put it like that? Yesterday... as I walked up the stairs, losing blood at every step. I was afraid. I turned around to look at you... and I saw the truth in your eyes. Oh? And what did the truth say? "I don't love you. Our marriage was a mistake. This baby should never be born." I've never given you reason to believe anything like that! - You can't deny it. - I can! I deny it most definitely! Perhaps I wasn't as happy as a man should be at the thought of his first child. I was worried for your sake, I must admit. And for my sake. For our sake. We were going to wait until my thesis was finished and things were more settled. I won't take responsibility for the death of the baby! Cissi dear... don't we have enough to deal with without taking on that guilt as well? And were you as happy as you should have been? Didn't you cry most nights? It wasn't easy to know whether to be happy or not. I was happy. Deep inside I was. I had brief moments of happiness. I'd think, "I'm going to have a baby." But I never dared show it. You were afraid I wouldn't share your feelings? Or you didn't dare show your happiness for fear something might go wrong? Forgive me. I'm being very clumsy. You don't love me, that's all. I'm a disappointment and a torment to you. I'm not what you dreamed of. I wasn't even able to give you a child. Don't you see what a horrible confirmation this is of my uselessness? I have to set you free. I want to see you happy. You want to see me happy? What about yourself? I'll be happy if I know you're happy. I like keeping to myself, Anders. I've always been that way. I'm not a very strong person. I'm not suited for life. Or in any case, for marriage. Are you saying you want to end our marriage? I want to set you free, Anders. I've known that for a long time, but I see it more clearly after what happened last night. And it's easier to do it here. And everything we've built together? Everything at home? The furniture, the books? Forget the worldly things for now. Leave all that for later. Later? What then? You have to give me time. - You don't want me to come here? - That would be best. Maybe I should take these too. I'd like to keep them. Please. Go now, Anders! Please go now! I'll take the liberty of calling the head nurse to inquire about your condition. That's very kind of you. You know very well it's not... Shall I leave the tea? No, thank you. Hello. I'm Dr. Thylenius. I have a few questions. Have you been healthy up till now? Have you ever been hospitalized? No, never hospitalized, but as a young girl I had a heart problem. Let's listen to your heart. That's good, thanks. No, nothing wrong there. When did you have your first period? Not until around 16. - Any children? - No. - Any miscarriages? - No. Any venereal disease? Gonorrhea, syphilis? No, nothing like that. Did you do anything to cause this miscarriage? Sorry? I didn't hear you. Did you do anything to cause this miscarriage? No, I didn't do anything. I really wanted the baby. That's all. Thank you. - Andersson's Sports. - May I speak to Tage? - Tage who? - Tage Lindin. Hi, Tage. It's Hjördis. Hi. How are you? Not too well. Things will be better once you get out. You'll see. Couldn't you come see me tonight? I can have visitors in the evenings. I need to talk to you. Are you crazy? In that god-awful place? All kinds of people come visit. Husbands, fiancés... I'm no goddamn fiancé! But you're the baby's father. I'll fix that when you get out. Not like last time, you hear? No, not like last time. I promise. What should I do? What should I tell them here? They ask so many questions. What have I done, what am I going to do... Their questions are driving me crazy! Don't say anything. Just keep your mouth shut. Hell, they're not using thumbscrews, are they? Cheer up. Listen, I can't stand here all day talking! Bye. Aren't they sweet? Let's talk a bit more. I have some time now. There's nothing more to talk about. Everything's fine now, according to Nurse Brita. The bleeding has stopped, and nothing else looks alarming. Have a seat. But... you don't seem too happy. Maybe you'd have preferred... You say that marrying the baby's father isn't an option, and you don't want to go home to your parents. They know nothing about the situation. But let me remind you of what I told you before. The situation for an unwed mother in Sweden today is entirely different from 30 or 40 years ago. Society today stands ready to help and protect the unwed mother as she fights for her child. There's maternity allowance and family allowance. There's free maternity care and social security. The rights of the child are protected by law. A social worker will help you and make sure the father pays child support... and so forth. There are also homes where you can stay before and after giving birth. Of course it would be better if you'd contacted your parents. You're... afraid of your mother, is that it? - I could call her... - I'm not afraid of my mother. Don't worry. We won't do anything you don't agree to. Please understand that society's views have changed tremendously. It's neither shameful nor misfortunate for a girl to have a baby now. You can call yourself "Mrs." and get yourself a little home. Where would I get the money? From the bank? You'll get a home loan and priority on the housing list. How do I pay the rent? You'd have to work, of course. And what about the baby? There are excellent day care centers with reasonable fees for low-income workers. What about nights? Or if I get sick? Well, some things you'd have to do yourself. But the joy of having a child... something to live for... Won't you try to look at it that way? As a gift you've been given. Something precious. Something not everyone gets, even if it's what they long for. There are women who can never have children because... You're trying to scare me so I'll cry. Not at all, my dear. I don't want to scare you. I'm not your "dear." And you do want me to cry, because then I'll go soft and not know what I'm saying. Then you'll trick me and force me to say things... I'd never force you. You want to talk me into having this baby! With all your talk of money and homes! And "aren't they sweet?" I think they're disgusting! Disgusting and repulsive! But what do you know, anyway? All you've done is read a lot of books. You've never forgotten your contraceptive! Never had a pair of tattooed arms burrowing into you! Whoa there! That was close. Nurse Brita, do you think babies are "sweet" too? Was that the argument? Do you think they're sweet? I see them every day, year after year, so I'm probably biased. Not exactly "sweet"... but there's something special about them. They have everything they need right from the start: lungs that breathe, a heart that beats, arms that wave, and hands that grip. I think they're little miracles. I think they're disgusting! I see. Nothing else? I feel sorry for them too for having been born. So what if they can kick and scream and wiggle their toes! It all turns to crap. Nothing but crap! Surely it's not all crap. I think it is. I wish I'd never been born. Oh God, how I wish I'd never been born! And not just now. I felt this way as a child too. And that's why you're so afraid to give birth yourself? Should I be forced to, if that's how I feel? Sometimes you have to do things without asking questions. I can't do it! Why does she have to torture me with "aren't they sweet"? She longs for a baby of her own, but she can't have one. After her last miscarriage, the doctor told her she should give up hope. Well, she doesn't have to fill my head with it. Let's see if there's any coffee left. I haven't had any yet myself. You were gone a long time. They said they're going to speed you up now. Really? Who said that? I bet it was just Thylenius. - No, the woman doctor too. I wonder if he heard that, the little one waiting inside, just sleeping and eating. Out you come, lazybones, so Mommy can get slim again! Out you come to the shirts and pants waiting for you. And to your father, who can't sleep at night waiting for you. Come out, you little rascal, you little scamp and mischief-maker! Come out and see your mother. You didn't pinch something from my medicine cabinet, did you? No, this is all faith, hope, and charity. Sometimes faith, hope, and charity need a helping hand. A beer? That'll be my first. You'll need it to get the other down. Castor oil? Then it's probably my last beer too. But down it goes! I'll drink it in little swigs. Come here. "One for Father and one for Mother... and one for our Father and no other. One for Gran who's never down, and one for Gramps... who lives in town. And one for Stina dear, so she won't shed a tear. And one for the little sailor boy... setting out on the River of Life, ahoy!" Have you ever had such a crazy woman in here? No, you're the worst case I've seen so far. I long for him so terribly. I'll go mad if he doesn't come out soon. What's wrong, Mrs. Andersson? Nothing. It was nothing. How does that line in the Bible go? "Then a sword pierced her soul." That's how it felt. I don't know where it came from, but suddenly I thought... "What if he doesn't come out like he should?" And it was like a pain shot straight through me. Why have I been joking and laughing so much? It's dangerous. "If you sing before breakfast..." But this isn't before breakfast. It's before dinner. Then it's all right. Then it doesn't count. Good heavens! Visiting time is in half an hour! Hjördis, will you comb my hair? Holding my arms up makes me so tired. Here. You should have been a hairdresser. You have just the right touch. It's not too late. You're still so young. Then you could manage with the kid on your own. My hairdresser is raising two boys by herself. You won't find two finer-looking boys in the neighborhood. How did you do that? I look fit for a ball! As my mom would say, you have the golden touch. My word! Shall I put on some powder? - Let's see what you've got. No, let me. - Your turn now. - I don't get any visitors. Sit here. Come on. You won't look as nice as me, but I can do a thing or two. You should look nice too, even if you don't have visitors. And how can you be so sure about that anyway? No, no. Keep your hopes up as long as you can. Let's see now. That's it. Now the other side. Stina's not as dopey as you might think. There you go, child. I certainly won't be having visitors. My husband was here this morning. - A little pampering is still nice, right? - Of course. You'll make a marvelous mother. So will you. Look, girls! Liver stew! Good-bye, anemia! And thyme! They actually used thyme! Yummy! Will you be eating here at the table, Mrs. Pettersson? Yes, thanks. The father reporting in. Did you go to the community garden to pick those? I happened to have the time. I thought you and the boy should have a greeting from there. No store-bought flowers, with ours in bloom when he's due. It won't be long now. They're giving him a little push. I had castor oil, and beer too. Imagine me drinking beer! I never could teach you the habit, but I guess he has. I doubt it will become a habit. The taste... ugh! This doesn't look too bad. Liver, right? That's right. Have you had any decent food, you poor thing? You should've seen the bacon I fried for dinner. Nice and crispy. You're here to see Hjördis? Hi, Hjördis. Hi. I didn't recognize you in that dress. - Please take this chair. - Thank you very much. Everyone in the department sends their regards. The flowers are from all of us, of course. I had to buy them on my lunch break and had nothing to put them in. They need some water. I'll tell the nurse. Can you do that? Just tell them? That's what they're here for. They get paid for it. I brought this too. Thanks. Now I have something to read. So you can be up and about? I'm not bleeding anymore. - You're not? - No. That means... You were bleeding so badly at work. The nurse said it wouldn't live. Well, it did! I was too damn conscientious. If I hadn't gone to work, I wouldn't be here. - You think you'd have lost it? - And good riddance! They gave me lots of shots and made me stay in bed. What had you done? The usual things. I took quinine, drank brandy, skipped rope. My God, how I skipped! And what are you doing now? Listen, Benke said Tage knows someone... What if I don't want to? If you stretch rubberized cloth over a frame like this and place it on top of the bathtub like this... then you needn't bend over so much to bathe him. They have rubberized cloth at the paint shop. I asked Nilsson. It's not too expensive. And you can get some plywood to lay across the bathtub, like so. Then you'd have all your creams and things handy: umbilical powder, bottom powder, hair powder, and whatnot. Not hair powder, you silly thing! But what if the board warps from the moisture? Not plywood, my dear. It's solid as hell. - Really? - It won't warp. You figured all this out when you couldn't sleep? I had to get up and make sketches. So I stood there a while sniffing your bathrobe too. Then I had to open the dresser and look at the baby's shirts and pants and all that. Then I went back to bed and slept like a log. You know what? You're as crazy as me. Visiting time is over. Well, bye. Bye, little mommy. You're crazy! Don't squeeze me so hard! Bye. Say hello to the little one. Well, time to take off the prettiness again. It was short but sweet. Mrs. Ellius, something to help you sleep? I don't usually take... The first night after something like this, it might help. Does it still hurt? - It's throbbing down there. - That's to be expected. I'll leave the pills here just in case. You don't look too happy. Dinner was good, but I could taste that castor oil the whole time. The end justifies the means. What beautiful flowers! From our own plot in the community garden. Now they're a welcome greeting for your son. That's right, nurse. May I put out the lights? Good night and sleep well. Good night. They're having their last feeding of the day. I have a pain in my stomach. Perhaps he's on his way tonight. He should be ashamed... disturbing his mother's sleep! But he's very welcome to. Tonight. I'm going to have him baptized in church after all... even if Harry isn't really keen on the idea yet. Harry... He's the best man in the world for me. But he doesn't really understand these things. Have you decided on a name? Harry, of course, after his father. No question. And then Konrad, after my father. Quite a name, huh? But that's a given too. And Torsten, after Harry's father. That's what everyone thinks we should call him. But I'll always call him "little Harry," of course. It will be so nice to sleep on my stomach again. I'm off to slumber land, ladies. "Slumber land" is what my mother would always say. Dear Mom... Good night and sweet dreams. Good night. Sweet dreams to you too. It's started, nurse. It's in full swing. Are they coming close together? Every five or six minutes. We'll move you to maternity. We're off now, ladies. I'm so happy. Dear sweet nurse... will you make sure my flowers are moved in the morning? They're from... Don't look so frightened, child. It's wonderful. This is life. I hope you can get back to sleep. Hello. I'm Nurse Inga-Britt. - Will that be his bed? - Yes, for your little crown prince. Slide over. Can you take a deep breath? I've been bragging that it's going to be a boy... but of course you're happy whatever it is. But I think... I think so too. And it's coming along quickly. Mrs. Andersson, this was quick. How are you feeling? It feels wonderful. I think the head has moved down. Is it pushing downwards now, during the contractions? I think so. Tell me when the next contraction starts. I think it's started. Take a deep breath and hold it. Push your chin down against your chest. Come on, push! That's it! Hold your breath and push! That's right. Is the contraction over? - I don't know. You can't sleep either? No. Not a wink. I'm wide awake. Me too. May I sit here a while? Pull this over you so you don't catch cold. God, I'm dying for a cigarette! Have one. What if someone comes? It's the middle of the night. No one will come now. I can't taste it! I can't taste anything! Probably the damn baby's fault! Don't call it a "damn baby." It hasn't done anything wrong. No... but I have. They all think I'm horrible. So do I. I think I'm horrible. I don't mean to answer back like I do. The words just tumble out of my mouth. I bite people's heads off even when I don't mean to. And at night, when I can't sleep, I get furious with myself and with everything. Everything just keeps growing and growing... and I always end up at the very bottom. No matter which way I turn, everything goes wrong, and I don't know what to do. Damn it! What a mess! I got ashes all over your bed! They'll know someone's been smoking. They can scold me in the morning. Want the light on? No, I found it. "If only things were different," you said. What did you mean? I mean, if I had someone who liked me enough to marry me... and somewhere to live so it could have a real home... then I'd be happy about the baby too. Not like Stina, of course... but still. In my own way. I always liked kids before. Before? When was that? A long time ago? I got tired of life back home. Nothing ever happened, so I just left. Won't your parents help you? No. Mother would never forgive me. Never! Those were her last words to me. She didn't want me to leave, of course. She was afraid I'd make a mess of things. "Don't you dare come home with a kid!" Isn't that what every mother says? But in the end she still takes her daughter in. Not my mother. She's always acted so haughty and superior, though Dad's just a common lumberjack. Dad... I don't think he'd mind so much, but Mother... What about the baby's father? He's not much of a father. He just wants to get rid of it. He's done it once before. You see... I didn't know what it was like. I didn't know anything. I just did what he told me. I'm never doing that again. Never! I'd sooner drown myself than go through that again. Why couldn't I have just lost it at the start? It feels like a big lump just sucking all the blood out of me. Though what you said is true, of course. It hasn't done anything wrong. I usually think that way too. I lie in bed at night and think... "It didn't do anything. It didn't ask to be born." Then I remember when I was little and wanted to run away. I used to think... "Who said I had to be born into this family? Who decided that?" And I had it good, compared to what this baby will have, without a father or anything. When he grows up, he'll come and ask me... "Why did you have to have me? It'd be much better if I'd died before I was born!" I still think you should talk to your mother. Mothers aren't always like we might think. They were young once too, and they haven't forgotten completely. Forgive me, Hjördis. The sleeping pill's starting to work. I took it after Stina left. Why don't you try to sleep too? I can't. I try and I try, but it just makes me more awake. I feel so restless. Did you get a sleeping pill? You haven't been taking your medicine? I couldn't avoid their injections, but I fooled them about the pills. That's one tough little baby you're carrying. He's standing his ground anyway. If only I knew which one was the sleeping pill. I'm sure it's this one. It looked like a little yellow rocket. - Maybe it will help me sleep. - It'll help. You'll see. Good night, Hjördis. I'm practically asleep already. He must be a whopper. Chin to your chest, hold your breath, and keep squeezing. A little more. Squeeze! That's it. That's it. That's it. Now rest. Just lie back and rest. That's good. Has it advanced that far already? - Any break between contractions? - Hardly any. - Is the contraction over now? - It still hurts. Dear God, I didn't know it would be this tough! Try to relax. Try taking deep breaths. - I'll go get Dr. Mellin. - Ask him to hurry. We're going to sedate you, Mrs. Andersson. - Is anything wrong? - It's a bit rough going. It'll be better if you drift off for a while. No forceps! Don't use forceps! You could hurt him! I can do it! I can manage! It's for your own good. Count with me, please. One, two, three... four... five... six... seven... Good morning. - Is it that late already? - I've been hearing them a while now. I wonder who's making all that noise. You needn't wonder anymore. This young lady will soon quiet down. My little sweetheart! Are you that hungry? Here you go. God, it's leaking all over! Go on now! Bringing flowers in already? You haven't aired the room yet. Just these. She especially asked for them to be moved here. - Did she have her baby? - I think so. It started late last night. She was in a different room before. No, no! That's not how a lady behaves! Just guzzling away without a thought! You hear? A little burp now, please. Nurse Maude. Excuse me, Nurse Brita. What happened? The baby died. I haven't seen the case notes yet, but they said her labor got too intense. She was so excited about the baby. You don't often see that. Does she know? I think so. I'm cold. I'll get you some extra blankets, Mrs. Andersson. What should we do? Nothing, Hjördis. There's no consolation that can help right now. It feels so awful... as if life itself had died. As if nothing will ever be born again. The doctors will be here soon. - How are you feeling, Mrs. Ellius? - Fine, I think. It still hurts a bit, of course. - You haven't been out of bed yet? - No. Try and get up a while this afternoon. I'd like to know why he died. I'm as much at a loss as you are, Mrs. Andersson. I'm truly sorry. There was nothing wrong with you... or with your little boy either, apparently. But it just wasn't meant to be... cruel as that may sound. That's all I can tell you. But... he was alive yesterday. I could feel him. Just last night. But he didn't survive the last part of labor. It seems it became too intense. There may also have been changes in the placenta, since you were so long overdue. But there's nothing to suggest it wouldn't go well next time. I think we can discharge you now. But please see the social worker first. She'll help you. Yes, it's in Room E. You can't bring them in now! - But they're hers! - Don't you understand? I'll ask Nurse Brita. Yes, X-ray tomorrow at 10:00 a.m. Nurse Brita, they were taking these in to Stina, but surely they mustn't. We'll put them here, Hjördis. You must be freezing, poor child! Go put some clothes on. You're going home today. It's awful in there... as if there were nothing but death all around. Nurse Brita... would you lend me some money to call my mother? Of course. Would you hold my hand? It won't take long. What's the number? Söderasen 975. Nurse Brita here, Ward 2. Could you get me Söderasen 975? Thank you. Ward 2, Nurse Brita. Just a moment. 975? Is that you, Mother? Mother, it's Hjördis. I haven't been well. I've been in the hospital. But I'm better now. Mother... I'm going to have a baby. That's why I haven't been well. I wanted to get rid of it, but I just can't. Mother, I want to have the baby, but I'll be on my own. Can I really? Even though exactly what you feared has happened? I'll be there tomorrow. I'll catch the train tonight. Bye, Mother. Did you hear what she said? "Come as soon as you can." I can't believe Mother said that. And I've been so scared of her. Do you have money for the ticket? No, I don't. What on earth shall I do? I can lend it to you. Perhaps Mrs. Gran will reimburse me from the social fund. How much is it? - 27.50. I have to write you a receipt. That's not necessary. I want to do it properly. Everything must be done properly now! Will 50 kronor be enough? Oh yes, as long as I get home. Will this do? If things work out well, it'll all be thanks to you. No, you had it in you all along. I just believed in it. Ward 2, Nurse Brita. I see. Very well. Thank you. I really think you and Anders are an exceptional match. As a confirmed spinster, I know I shouldn't meddle... But Anders is my younger brother, and you know what he means to me. - You of all people should understand. - Understand what? That women like me should never marry. We're independent enough to want to stand on our own two feet... but not independent enough to be of use to our spouses. Our only option is solitude. And what do you think solitude means? A cool tranquility? Inviolable security? That's an illusion, Cissi. Real solitude is an acrobatic act... with constant fear lurking in the background. Constant fear, Cissi. Are you cut out for that? - Despite all you say, I think I am. You're sure it's not guilt heightened by your current physical condition? It's precisely my physical condition that... I wanted to say good-bye. I'm going now. - But we won't get a chance to... - I'm going home. Home to your mother? Thank you for everything. You've been very kind. Stina's asleep. Will you tell her I'm going home? Of course. Good luck. Anyway, you two can't leave things like you did yesterday. Anders was devastated and couldn't understand. You two have to talk. Yes, we have to talk. Shall I tell him to stop by tonight? Ask him to stop by if he likes... if he can bear to.
