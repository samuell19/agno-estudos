We are born again This is your house... and I am talking standing before your house You used to stay here with your mom and dad, you remember? Afreen, please respond. I don't know where you are? Afreen... Please... What is this? What is this? This nonsense running on the TV... Here... Khan Sir, she used to say in childhood Mom... I remember something What do you remember? I was dead I saw it with my own eyes. She used to tremble and wake up from sleep so many nights Similarly, she used to sing songs she never heard But I never believed her. -But seeing all these... -You stop talking crazily We believe that a human gets just one life. Human is born once, dies once and if god wishes... ...he gets to heaven and the story ends -But seeing all these happenings, she... -Mumtaj, enough! Enough! What is all this? Did you ever meet this boy? Do you remember anything? -What I am asking is... -Come on... What would she say Khan Sir? I told you earlier that she is roaming with some guy in India. Control your tongue and speak Nadir, I am talking here -Afreen, what I am asking is... [groans] Nadir... Nadir, stop it Did only he remember the whole flash back or even you? Huh? Tell me... Nadir, what are you doing? -Leave her -Let go of her. Even he caught my neck like this that day. Who? Hawaldar Hey Indian... Since I saw you, I am gone sleepless in the nights from then You do not like me? You want that guy huh? You need him? Huh? Hmm... [gasps] [bullet chamber creaks] Say now, you need that fellow? [empty gun shot] [groans] You need him? [empty gun shot] [groans] If the bullet is shot this time, you are gone. I will not leave you, understood? I will not leave. I will take him for sure. I mean your lover... I will finish him for sure. What will I do? I will kill him. What are you writing? Diary. What is written here? I feel like killing all the Pakistan Military people. What have we done wrong to them? Are these humans or demons? Read this. I do not know even the name of that soldier. But when he was taking punishment for me, my eyes went damp. I then understood that... there are humans with heart even in Pakistan. What are you writing now? It would have been great if these borders never existed. It would have been much great if he was not a Muslim. Whichever may be the Nation, what more would be a greater respect than to love a soldier? Only the soldier has a heart to love the country. Enough to get even a small space in that heart. I will live on happily. Kill that rascal! [gun fires] [Arabic language] [The song is about self motivation & to fight for what you want] [gun shot] [gun fires] [arabic song continues] [gun fire] [bullet hits a metal] [gun fires] [gun cocking] [gun fires] [gun cocking] Sir...

Over [bullet shot] [gun fires] [fire crackling] [voice on radio] Kabir... There. What is this? I prayed God that nothing should happen to you in the war. Nothing will happen to me, because the war is over. Is the war over? What will happen now? We will leave. All these days, I was frightened about war. But now, I feel it was good if war still continued. Why? Because you will be before my eyes. War is over there, but the war has started here now. Because it is very easy to start love and a war, but it is very tough to stop that. It's very tough. I just understood how tough it is. I cannot bear this distance in between us both. You were seen very far away while seeing you from a distance and thus I used to come near you. Now though I am beside you, I feel to be very far away. My heart has no satisfaction however close I am with you. I am frightened. I too am frightened. Even to blink, because I may miss seeing you even for that one second. There are so many stars, so many planets, 200 countries and seven seas in this Universe. God gave you to me between all these. I will be grateful to that God for it. Not just for making us meet, pray your God to keep us together for lifelong. I cannot ask, Today is the last day. No idea whether we meet again or not. Tomorrow is the Refugee exchange. [Lag Ja Gale song from the film Woh Kaun Thi (1964)] No idea whether we meet again or not No idea whether we have another life or not It is just this night left out. I am dying... I am dying...

You have been screaming Kabir, will you go and meet him now? I can know seeing your eyes that you will definitely go and meet him now. That was all in that life and not in this life. You should love only me in this life. Nadir! Keep control Nadir. Mumtaz! Let us move fast and make arrangements. Take away her mobile phone and put her closed in the room. She will step out from the room only when the marriage band is on. Take her away.

We are not doing a marriage which she does not like. If that is true, ask her to say that in front of all here. We all heard it You are saying a lie. You are saying a lie. It is written even in your Islam, right sir? Any girl should be asked about her wish before marriage. You agree or no. This is the right of a girl sir. It is written in Quran and Shahi Muslim Hadith. Respect your Islam sir, respect your daughter. Know what she likes. Khan sir... Yes sir. You ask your daughter about what she wants. This is our rule. Khazi sir, this marriage is on with her willingness. Still, I will ask her once again for you. Afreen, you like this marriage right? No. Hey, she is saying a lie. She is saying the truth. What she is saying is true and do not get her married against to her will sir. Oh God! I will never get a marriage done to my daughter against to her will. But I cannot give my daughter even to a stranger like you. Why should I give? I am reborn again for your daughter. Is this one reason not enough sir? What is your profession? Captain, Indian Army. See, he is from Indian Military it seems. If we leave him like this today, he will come with a gun tomorrow and kill us all. -He has so much revenge on us. -Nadir, one minute. You are a Hindu and an Indian. Do you have at least a bit of respect on Islam religion in your heart? -I do respect. -Thank God. Are you ready to take up Islam religion for my daughter? Yes, ready. God is the biggest ruler. Then say hail to Islam once from your mouth. Hail to Islam... Hail to Islam! Hail to Muslim! Hail to Salman Khan... Hail to Shahrukh Khan... Hail to Aamir Khan... Hail to Abdul Kalam... Hey, this is not enough. He belongs to Indian Army. We should thus never believe this guy. Say now idiot, say hail to Pakistan. Hey, do not change the topic.
