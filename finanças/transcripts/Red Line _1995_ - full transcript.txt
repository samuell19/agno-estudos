It's all done. What do you think of those new shocks? A little stiff. So I take it you went for a drive in it? I drive all the cars I build. You uh... think I made the right decision with new shocks? You think those old ones might have been able to handle going over a curb? You'ld be alright... long as you knew what you're doing. I take it you do. is write your stolen That's right. You uhh... You ever stolen a car? you ask a lot of questions you a fucking cop? Ha ha ha. I doubt it. No this is just between you and I. I've been known to barrow a car now & again. When's the last time you borrowed a car? Well think about this & don't answer real quick. There's a difference between borrowing 1& test driving 1. What if I told you I was over a a liquor store near Bigs last night. I saw something real strange. Something real strange? Like what a fucking UFO? Yeah... A little red UFO. You ever think about a high paying driving job? I work alone. Not anymore. I want you to deliver that car to my house in an hour. Got it? Jim, I do not want you gettin' mixed up with this guy. What are you talking about? I'm talking about he's bad news. I get a funny feeling right here. And I do not want you to get in trouble. How can I get in trouble if I've never been out of it? Listen to me... I know I promised your father you've got a job here no matter what. But let me put it this way. Anybody who is on Keller's payroll... Is not working for me. Get it? Gonna get involved? You get involved and your fired. End of story. You know Jerry... That's the beautiful thing about this country... freedom of choice. [Hip, funky, traveling music plays.] Hey I like the way you do that. Kind of gentle but firm. Well you know what they say... a car is like a Woman. You don't know how to handle it it won't run right. Well hey I know how to handle my car. Oh well I guess you don't need me then. Oh, thaks. [Funky music starts up again.] This your car? No I'm just delivering it. Good. I picture you with something more sleek Really. Yeah. It's all in the eyes. You know how to read a person's eyes then you don't need words. Ha ha ha. Is that so? Trust me. Well I don't know you well enough. Then you need better eyes. [Distant motorcycle approaches.] Ahh, shit. Hey baby get on. I'm working. You're working? Looks like you're talkin' to an asshole. You can say that again. Get on the bike. Get on the fucking bike and stop your bullshit. You got something to say? I didn't think so. Alright so what've you got for me? Well the vette's still in impound. Oh yeah the vette. What's the fucking story on this kid? He's been in and out of juvenile correctional facility since his teens. He had his first Grand Theft Auto at 11 and then again at 13 and 16. Yeah? So he's never been in the joint. I guess after all that practice as a minor he got his act together. Record's spotless. Not even a speeding ticket. No rape. No nothing. He eventually lost all his sponsors so after dropping out of the Pro Nascar race circuit he became a DD expert. A DD. VD, DD what the fuck is a DD? Uhh... demolition derby. You know destruction derby? You know it's a bunch a junkers get together. About a dozen of them and they Ram each other till only one's left running. I guess that's the winner. And apparently the kids been undefeated for last few seasons. And? Not much. No record. No family. His Mom died when is was 5. His Dad got killed racing Nascar in some Raceway in the middle of nowhere about 10 years ago. And you know that guy Jerry? The fag? The hairdresser? Yeah... no no not the fag. The guy that runs the repair shop. Oh. That clown. He used to be on the old man's pit crew for years. sounds perfect [Funky, hip music starts up aging.] Bring my car? All finished. Let's talk business. I got a little job for ya. You do it and I'll forget about the liquor store the other night. What's the job? Not much. I want you to pick up this little red Ferrari and bring it to me. I'll give you four thousand dollars. Four thousand dollars? Here's the address. If the front gate is open you can just drive it right out. If not you might have to use some skill. A little repo job. No problem. When? As soon as possible. My driver will drop you off near the house. OK. You gonna send him to Larry's place? A little assignment before the main event. He'll never make it through Larry's security. You don't think so? Umm... we'll see. [Mysterious military drum music starts.] [Music stops.] [Birds tweat in the distance.] [Military drum music starts again.] [Music continues minus the drums.] [Sexual moans.] [Mysterious Music starts up.] [Louder sexual moans.] [Garage door opening noises.] [Tapping and dinging music starts.] What the hell is he doing on the lawn? [The Music is low but tapping.] Get the car. [Music slowly builds and picks up momentum.] [The music is fast and driving.] [Car wash machines can be heard fading in.] [Fade from bubbles and the car wash machines.] Wow, this your car? Hey. I never got your name. We should charge you more for this one. For what? Well cleaning cars is one thing but uhh... laundry is extra. Hee hee. You really should watch what cars you hang out with. A lot of rust and disease out there. Well I'll keep that in mind... Gem. Jim, well that's a uhh... That's a guy's name isn't it? Not Jim. Gem as in precious stones like diamonds emeralds. Well Gem, I'm Jim. Jimmy. As in the short crowbar used by burgalers. Right. Hi. Oh shit... Your boyfriend seems like a real dick. Well actually dick is his name and unfortunately his disposition. Excuse me I gotta make my great escape. Nice to meet you. Nice meeting you. See you around huh...? OK. [Distant Motorcycle approaches.] Where'd the girl go? None of my business. Hey aren't you the guy she was talking to the other day? No. My name's not asshole. Dick. Hey pal. Watch yourself or I'll be carving you a new one. Here's some good advice. You stay away from my old lady. [Funky music starts up.] So no problem? The gardener's gonna be a little pissed though. Ha ha ha. Larry will get over it. Sit down. I like you kid. I'd like you to drive for me. You just did use a driver like me. Ha ha ha. What I don't understand is... it looks like you could afford your own Ferrari. Well that goes without saying... You know that guy Larry and I... We were business partners. And there is still some unfinished business. That Ferrari is just sort of a means to an end. I still say that I like you kid. And I'd like you to drive for me but I'd like you to drive for me on more of a permanent basis. Well I don't like anything permanent. I like to keep moving. So that means you don't want to work for me? I didn't say that. I guess I could come on as sort of a ... temp. Or a specialist? Fair enough. Good. We got another car I want you to borrow. The cops took a car from me a while back. I need it. Ha ha ha. I don't borrow anything from the cops. Well, technically, wouldn't be borrowing from the cops. It's in a little tow yard. There wouldn't be any cops for miles around. Technically cops. That'll cost extra. Say... twenty thousand? Why? Let's just say it's my favorite car. I'd like it back. [Funky, hip music starts up again.] The car's in a tow yard up North. A town called Fresno. We're looking for a blue Chevy Corvette. [Funky hip music plays again.] They got it parked with a slew of other sports cars that have been seized. How fast can you hot wire a Corvette? What model Corvette? New body style. Fast. Look if it got towed last night it's here. If you want it you gotta come down with the money. Hey, how you doing? Good. Real good. I'm here to pick up my car. Got the registration? Fill this out. Got the 89 bucks? Alright. I'll be back down in a minute. Excuse me. Am I interrupting you? I got a fucking car in there. Look just relax. I'll get your fucking car. It's a black Cabriolet 911 Porsche. Its brand fucking new. It just got washed. I don't want your wop ginny grease anywhere on the fucking car. Shhh... Relax will you? You want the fucking car you want to drive around in a fucking VW like your old boyfriend? Then shut the fuck up. I know you fucking ginnys work. Alright. That's an enough. Diego prick. That's enough just stop. Black Porsche? Well I'll go get it for you. Black, shiny clean, tan fucking interior convertible 911 Porsche alright? [Mysterious music que.] First you shoot the dogs. There may be several blue Vettes. What you have to do is scratch the paint. Look at the coat undernieth the blue... The car I want's got white. [The mysterious slow music continues.] [Car alarm sounds.] [Dog barks.] [Dog barking.] [Sneaky music continues to play.] Hey. Thought maybe you left. Na. Will it start? What? Your car. You think it will start or do you need me to give you a jump? Yeah no problem. Alright. Here's your paper work. [Mysterious music starts up again.] [The music builds faster.] Ouch. Shit. [Skidding tires.] One black Porsche coming down. [Falling music plays.] [Fast music starts.] [Washing machine noises start.] Hey where's the girl that usually works here? She just left. With that sleazy rider jerk. [Loud car wash machines rumble.] What's this shit? Don't ya know what kind of beer I drink by now? Oh go to hell Dick. What do I gotta embarrass you right here? Get the right beer and lets get out of here. Screw you Dick. You know I've had enough of your shit. [Gunshot] Next one goes in your head. Let her go. [Ominous music que.] Go on... get outta here. Put all the money on the counter now. [Cash register ring's and opens.] Hey Pal this is none of your business. I deal with my old lady the way I want. Shut the fuck up and get down on the floor. Oh another tough guy with a gun. Why don't you put the gun down, we'll step outside and see what you're made of. OK tough guy... Let's go. Rule number one... don't ever trust anybody. [Ominious music continues.] Get out. No. Get out. I'm going with you. No you're not. Get out. I don't think so Jim. The eyes never lie. Remember? Look, this is your last chance. Once I get going I'm not stopping let you out. Now get out. Fine let's go. Hit it. Damn it. [Fast rock music plays. Police sirens in the distance.] [Slow mysterious music plays.] So... Where to now? If I get caught... You become an accessory. What are you talking about? I'm a hostage. Bullshit. I'm just kidding. Where's your sense of humor Jim? Yeah... So... How much did you get? More than I wanted. [Funky music plays.] Well I guess we'll chill here until nightfall. Alright. So if you want out now's your chance. And go back to what? I'm a drifter Jim. I'm gonna take a nap. Why did you steal this car? Same reason I robbed the liquor store. Oh, right. You're a real dangerous criminal. What? So armed robbery is small-time in your book huh? Only amateur punks knock off joints like that. Ohhh... My dad never sunk that low. Your Dad? Yeah. He's a real dangerous criminal. I mean he only pulled serious armed robberies. But he was also the best wife beater and child abuser in Arizona so... Believe me I've seen it all and there's nothing exciting about the criminal mind. So armed robbery doesn't turn you on? Well... It depends on whose doing it... and how armed they are. You know... I think I'm getting better at this eye thing. I know what you want. Really? You do? Yeah. I do. Food. You gotta be as hungry as I am. What? An apple? You thought my eye were saying I wanted an apple right now? Ha ha ha. Unbelievable. Ouch. I saw a greasy spoon about a mile down the road. Come on. Hey. I saw you looking at me. You know you want me. I wanna eat and I wanna sleep. You wanna have sex witth me. Admit it. Maybe later. Fuck later. That's what I said. [Slow romantic music plays.] We can't find a car. We can't find a stupid kid... Is there any damn thing we can find? Well he hasn't been picked up by the cops yet Boss and there's no reports of any accidents. And we went and saw his boss Jerry and well we kinda roughed him up a little bit. Look... this is a small town. How many places can you hide in that god damn place? You know I think we otta just uhh... lay low for a while. You know? Look it damn it. You just find that car... I don't give a damn you go door-to-door if you have to. You find the car. You hear me? Alright Boss. [Dial tone.] [Phone touch tone sounds.] [Ringing.] Keller. It's me. I uhh... I got your car. Well fuck me with a flagpole. You planning on keeping it? No. No. You bet your ass no. I want it and I want it now. There's just one hitch... The cops think I stole it... So they're watchin' my place. I want you to take it to a different address. You got a pencil? 740 Molton Avenue. That's a warehouse. Seven forty... Molton? Alright I got it. You run into trouble, you call me on my cellular. Alright? Yeah I got it. And Jim, don't run into any more trouble. [Dial tone.] That guy's macabre. [Phone rings.] Yeah. Check out time's soon. Who is it? You gonna stay another night? Uhh... Yeah. Yeah I am. You have to pay in advance again. Yeah, no problem. Bring some food. Hey but no more chicken or pizza alright? Sandwiches and fruit. Sandwiches and fruit. Alright. And more sheets. More sheets. OK. Thanks. [Mysterious and funky music cue plays.] So what's going on? You blackmailing the guy you stole the car from? No. Police had the car. I'm delivering it back to the owner. How much you getting? Twenty thousand. Twenty Thousand for delivering a car? Look I don't know. It's the boss's favorite ride or something. So where's it stashed? that was what's there any kind Where is what stashed? We need to find the shit. What shit? Look if they're paying you 20 thou for delivering this car there's gotta be something in here worth millions. Good point. [Slow deep ominous music plays.] Oh well now that's interesting. What? Nothing. Just keep looking. [The slow deep ominous music continues.] Look this is pointless. If the cops couldn't find it... how are we? So you have no idea what we're looking for? I mean... It could be disguised as part of the car. You know... In my opinion you're being screwed. They know you're a nickle and dime theif and they're exploiting you. Yeah well $20,000.... That's a lot of nickels and dimes. Maybe my friends can help. Wanna see where I live? Sure. [Sneaky Music plays.] Hey, is this where you live? Yeah. Why? It figures. You said you were a drifter. Hey. This is Jo my roomy and this is Kiki. Hey. Dick was just here. Well Dick and I are through. This is Jim. He's uhh... Driver's Ed teacher. Wow... sounds like another perfect match for you. Well if you're broken up you better tell me cause he's really pissed off. You tell him. He's your brother. Well he's your boyfriend. Well you introduced us so you break it off. Oh... by the way... If you two had your hands on something really valuable, would you give away for a little money or would you hold out for the big bucks? Well is there danger involved? Possibly. Go for the big bucks. Told you. Fixed vote. So what do we tell asshole when he shows up? Tell him... That she's with me. [Upbeat music starts.] Big gun. See ya. Bye ladies. [Hopeful music continues to play.] Keller? It's Jim. I got your car. You tell me that one more time and I'll shoot you in the fucking head I swear to god. Well it was a little more difficult than I anticipated. Where the hell are you? I think I'm going to need more bread. How much more? Well, a lot. You bring me that car in one piece I'll give you 40 grand. 40? No... That was way too fast. The shit must be worth millions. Shhh. Tell him to add a zero to your salary. Shut up and go over there. Let me handle this. If he doesn't cooperate tell him you're gonna take the car apart. go. I know what I'm talking about Jim. [Ferry horn blows in the distance.] I know that fery whistle Frank. The kid's at Fisherman's Wharf just north of Santa Barbara. Go get the Vette. and kill him. Listen Keller... You're going to have to add a zero to that 40. Getting a little greedy aren't you kid? Well possession is nine-tenths of the law. You've got something I want... and I've got something you want. I'm gonna want it in 20' & 50's. [Chuckles.] [Phone rings.] Well of course you do. I've got the kid in sight. Hey. Gene's got a visual on the kid. Let me give you some advice... This world is full of surprises Jim. I've come across my share. I mean hell. I know people. I thought I had you figured. But you managed to surprise me. And that's a feat in itself. But I've learned something... No matter how big the surprises is... it's over pretty quickly. A guy is walking down the street... Suddenly he gets shot in the head. Hell that's a surprise. A quick shock... and it's all over. You see Jim... I found it much more effective and painful if the person who's going to be killed knows that in advance and there's stress, anxiety, panic, Ha... Despair. Those are all the traits I look for in an effect hit on a person that I hate. And guess what Jim? I really hate you. Look if you kill me you'll never find a car. Oh I think I will. I've already found you. Panic is sitting in now isn't it Jim? Look around... My man is there at fisherman's warf. [Chuckle.] Feel that stress building inside you? He's gonna kill you Jim. And I'm really going to enjoy it. I can even feel your despair growing over the telephone lines. Well it's not over till it's over. Gem. Pretend like you're waiting to use the phone. This guy in the car back here... He wants to kill me. I'll meet you behind the restaurant. Alright. [Slow deadly music plays.] I don't see the car. I'm gonna have to Follow the kid. [Mischievous sneaky music plays.] [The music stops.] [The music slowly fades back up.] [Horns from oncoming cars honk.] [Faster more intense chase music plays.] Aaaahhhhh.... [Low ominious music plays.] [Screams as he burns alive.] [Tires squeal.] Ask for 6 figures I know what I'm talking about. Hey, I didn't know they were such creeps. How was I supposed to know they were going to try to kill you? They're organize crime honey. That's what they do. Well I didn't know that. You know I don't work for them. OK, I'll take the blame. You just figure a way out. Alright, I got a plan... A bit of a long shot though. OK. [Motor winding at high RPM.] [Military sounding drums beat.] [Intercom beeps.] Yeah? Yeah is Larry in? Larry's not seeing any visitors today. Yeah, well he will want to see me. Who are you? Tell him the guy that stole his Ferrari is here. [The military drum music plays again.] Well, what do you think? It's nice. Fancy. But it doesn't float. [The military drums continue to beat.] Not to question you're ability Jim but... I'm starting to have doubts about this plan of yours. Just keep cool. Have a seat. Excuse me. Have I see you two here before? I don't think so. Yeah likewise. Uhh... this happens to be my house. Can I help you? Will you shut up? Oh sorry bro. The best thing for you to do right now is just watch and listen. Don't get involved. You got it. So. I understand you're the man that stole Crystal's Ferrari. Is that right? Not the greatest news to get coming off a plane I must admit. If you still have it... I want it back. Well, that's not going to happen. But I got something you might like. What might that be? I've been working for Keller lately. Keller? Ha ha ha... Ha ha ha... Did you see his face? Ha. Ha ha ha ha... Kill them. Yeah. Does a blue Corvette mean anything to ya? [Mysterious music starts up.] Yeah... why? Well it just so happens that I have it in my possession. You do? I stole it for Keller but I'm thinking I might give it to you instead. Listen, I don't think this guy knows what he's talkin'... Shut up. OK. You wanna trade your lives for a Corvette? Well... I was thinking about something a little better than that. How about our lives and... 200,000 dollars? Ha ha ha ha... That's very funny... Why would I want to pay for something I already own? Cut the crap. We'll trade the car and the shit inside the car. The package huh... You know about that? Yeah... and I think 200 thousand dollars is fair. It's gotta be worth millions. I didn't get your name... miss... uhh... Well if you had my name you'd be my father. Ho ho ho... that's very funny. Larry honey? Yeah? I'm going for a swim. Wanna join me? In a minute. Meet the guy who uhh... stole your car honey. Kill 'em. Ha ha ha ha... You kill us... the deal's off. Uhh... Deal? Excuse me but... there is no deal. I'm not gonna pay for something twice. As long as I know the car is in LA... Well my men will find it. Not if Keller's men find it first. Keller's a little maggot, I intend to squash, very hard. You wanna know who runs this town? You're looking at him. So if you'll excuse me... I got things to do. Just kill them painlessly. I don't penalize stupidity. See, see he's a giving person and that's why i love him. Let me ask you something... If you run this town how come you can't stop your old lady from fucking everybody? Whoa... Excuse me? Now just what the fuck is that supposed to mean? You're lying. He's lying. Hey. Shut up. We've been having a good time up to now... You want to die rough... I can work that out. But you said the wrong thing. If you got anything to back it up... I want to hear it right now. Steal a Ferrari... and get a free sex show. Ha ha ha ha... Check it out. Uhh huh... Ha ha ha ha ... This isn't funny. I mean this is you know... I think it's hilarious. These are yours. Honey he's lying, I swear to god. Who was it? I'll throw it into the deal... 200 thou... you get the car and I'll let you know which one of these guys it was. Which one of these? One of these... don't look at me Larry I got my ball shot off in Vietnam. No no no no hold on... Whose been fucking around here huh? You can't listen to this guy. I mean these are your security. Listen... this guy does not know what he's talking about please listen to me... Shut up. One of you guys think it's kind of funny fucking around with the boss' old lady? Huh??? Please stop it. Please don't do this. Who was it? I don't think that it's possible. I mean you know these guys man. They're here every day. There's no way it's one of them. So who got through the fucking gate? Larry... listen who's going to get through that gate? It's got to be one of your guys from the inside. Somebody that knows where the cameras are where they aren't. Alright alright alright I want the car You get your 200 G's, but I want the name. I want the name. I want that name. I want it now. I'll pick up the car and I'll get hold of ya. And then I'll tell you everything I know. Don't make me wait too long. Nice way to treat your brother. Real nice. Will you guys get outta here please. Family upset now. [Mysterious music plays.] I guess Keller was right. Distractions do work with Larry. I can't believe you pulled that off. Well I guess I'm just a lucky guy. [A loud motor from another car.] What's going on? Who are these guys? Who do you think? Oh shit. [Spooky mystical music plays.] Hold on baby. OK. [The spooky mysterious music continues.] Shit. [The spooky mysterious music continues.] I know a back road outta here. [The spooky mysterious music continues.] What do you mean you lost him? What the hell is wrong with everyone? [Motor excellerates.] How much longer do I gotta keep running your guys off the road? Until you're fucking dead. Where's my goddamn car kid? Well as I see it, the car's not really yours. According to the registration Larry's the owner. And he's very interested in getting the car back. In fact he's willing to pay more. You made a deal with Larry? How much? 200 thousand. You know you're a fucking dead man. Larry's the biggest cutthroat Thief I know. Soon as you give him the car he'll slit your goddamn throat. He'll dump you in the sewer. At least I'd give you a goddamn proper burial. Well you're gonna have to do better than that if you ever want to see your Vette back. What are you doing? Shh... quiet. Jim, I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll give you 250. Half now... half upon delivery of the car. Yeah... and when I go to pick up the cash you'll have your men take me out. No. What you do is you send someone else. A third-party to pick it up. And when you think it's cool, you call me and tell me when you'll bring my vette down to the warehouse. OK, that sounds doable. Just tell me where and when you want the first half of the money. I'll be there. The alley behind the bank at 5th and Brooks. One hour. What about Larry? Watch. [Dial tone, phone beeps, ringing.] It's for you sir. Thanks Mike. Hey Mike could you get me a glass of white wine please. Hey what's your problem? Don't be telling people what to do.

Look if everything goes as planned we're going to be 225,000 dollars richer. You just made deals for 450,000 can't you count? Look these guys want to kill me... and eventually they're going to succeed. Unless they kill each other first. Yeah and where are we gonna be? Out of town hopefully. Oh. What about the car? We'll just let them fight it out. You're a smart guy you know that? Why thank you. So I'm gonna go, I'm gonna pick up the money... and I'll meet you back here in two hours tops OK? Alright. You be careful. I will. Oh... by the way... I think I love you. Ditto. [Reggae music plays.] Hey. What are you doing here? I got a favor to ask you. Yeah? Someone's looking for you. You didn't tell him? I did but he didn't take it too well. Jesus. Let's go. We're outta here. Look. It's over between us OK? It's over when I say it's over and not before. You need a clearer answer is that it? Is that clear enough for ya? Look, I'm sorry about that. I don't give a shit. He used to slap me around too. You think you can get off work for about an hour? Sure. What's up? I need you to help me on an errand so I can be in two places at once. You need to pick up a package & meet me back here in an hour. OK, I can handle that. Come on. Sam... cover for me. [The reggae music continues.] [Tense scary music starts.] Come on Gem. Where the hell are ya? [Dial tone, beeps, ringing.] Keller? It's Jim. What the hell happened? And where's the girl? And where's the money? I thought you were smarter and send someone you could trust? I trust her. What happened? 125,000 dollars is very tempting for some people. I guess it was just a little too much for your girlfriend. She wouldn't screw me. That's how I felt about you. But you never know these days. Where the hell is she? Look. She picked up the money and I had my boys follow her. Just in case. Went right to the airport and bought a one way ticket to London. I don't believe it. So you didn't plan on her leaving the country without you huh? She's skipping out on you Pal. No, I still don't believe it. You want my guys to take her down? Listen if you want me to stop her... You better decide fast cause her plane takes off real soon. No. Let her go. So you really do love her huh? Well that makes things easier. Make her scream. [Female screaming.] Gem. [More female screams.] Keller... You hurt her... and I swear to god I'll kill you. 740 Multon Avenue. I'll be there.

A fine chick. Well yeah. Well you see the way I figured it is... me and my brother were never very close so... if I was with his girl... maybe we could get a little bit closer family bonding you know that kind of a thing. Jim... Jim... Jim... How'd you get away from Keller? Keller? I never met the man. Well what the hell happened? Well I picked up the money from Larry's men. See. I had my friend Jo go to pick up Keller's money. And she was supposed to meet me back at the bar but she never showed. I wait for an hour and then I went to the motel and you were gone. s So I came here. He kidnapped the wrong girl. [The music picks up speed as they chase.] Who is that? That's Crystal's lover. Well lose the asshole. [The music continues to build.] Uhh... Jim... This isn't good. Aw... shit. Uhh... I think the bullet just grazzed me. No big deal. Look I'm going to shit can this car so we can get out of this alive.
