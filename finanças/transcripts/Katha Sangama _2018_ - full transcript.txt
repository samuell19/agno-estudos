Aren't you done yet Sathya? When Magic gets Real... (Radio) Pranava, you said something? No. I am not sure what I should speak about Huh? I can’t think of a thing to say in office tomorrow! What do I wear? Try my suit. What are you planning to wear? I can’t make it tomorrow, appa. And I’ve been saying this for a week now! I’ve to be in Chennai. But Pranava... Don’t you know it’s my last day at work tomorrow? Don’t be so immature, appa. What’s this “first day-last day” nonsense? If you could get permission… That’s not an option, appa. It’s an official trip. (Phone ringing) You can’t spare an hour for your father? Yes. Where are you? I am coming. Coming. Take Madhu or Prabhakar uncle along. And appa, be careful with my suit! Forget it. I dont need your goddamn suit. We will come for sure. What did Pranava say though? He brushed me aside asking me to take you guys along. Poor guy, who knows what his commitments are. Don’t be taking his side now! I’m not taking his side at all. I… Listen, I don’t care if you guys can’t make it either... What I meant is… Sathya? Hello… Sathya… Hello (Office Ambience) Good morning sir! Good morning SM sir. It’s your last day today, please relax. We’ll take care of all your files. Let them worry about it, sir. Sir, you’ve got your lunch along? What about the treat? Let’s do it anywhere else but Shanthi Sagar or Adigas. Is Nagarjuna okay for you madam? Yes, yes. Don’t worry, he’ll buy us. (Office Ambience) Good morning, Murthy sir. Here’s your tea. I don’t want the tea. I’ve made it specially for you, sir. No, I’m okay. Krishnappa. Sir! I had that Diwakar company’s claims file somewhere here. Did you see it? That new employee said he will take care of it. Don't be bothered sir. You just relax. You just relax. You just relax. Who the hell is he to take my file! And who are you to tell me to relax… Were you all ever concerned about me or my work in all these years? Nagraj. You want to take care of my work? I have had to correct more than 100 files of yours. They reek of cigarettes all the time. And Ms. Chitramani. I’ll buy you lunch today and tomorrow as well. But first stop sending those damn yoga videos on the whatsapp group. Bloody hypocrites. Why do you serve me this disgusting tea when I don’t want it! Go get the files from that guy. Hey Sudhakar! What is that video you have shared man? Like a yoga master. Krishnappa, please ask him to give me the files. Okay sir. (More indistinct chatter) Aren't you done yet Sathya? Murthy ji. Murthy ji! Sir?

Special arrangements for tomorrow. Nothing fancy about this, Krishnappa. The same old stage... Same shawl... Another bouquet... Another garland. The same samosa and tea for us too. SM sir is the only special person. Hello, Pranava! Tell me. (Over phone) Yeah, yeah. Sure sure, I’ll do it. Appa, I have a flight at 12 tonight. Rohan and I are coming over. hmm... Cook something for dinner. Alright… (Kannada song playing on TV) Hey,you! Yes. Tell me. Give me 1 kg sugar. 1 kg sugar… And a packet of vermicelli Okay And cashews. Yes, yes, yes. Give me 100 grams. Uncle, didn’t you ask for a broomstick last time? Try this new brand. It’s a good one. No , not today. You might not get it tomorrow. Just pick it up. Awareness alone will overcome illusion New memories arrive only when you forget the old The spirit-bird will fly away all alone The spirit-bird will fly away all alone Before realising that the world is a fair of illusions Hey! Where’d you find these things? This? At that site there… Hey…hey… Sathya! Wasn’t there a fair here yesterday? A fair? Since a year this construction is as messed up as a fair. Now get lost from here. How much is the ticket? It’s a free ride! Walk along… You’ll know exactly where to stop. Haven’t you been staring for a bit too long? Huh? I said you’ve been at it for a really long time… What should have I done then? Can I share a small story with you? Huh? Not so long ago... there was this learned man... hmmm... must be as old as you are… was travelling on a train... and then... the ticket collector came over and said... "sir..." "your ticket?" he asked. But the learned man could not find the ticket on him. He looked for it in his bag... his pockets... and searched all the suitcases he was carrying. Nope. No trace of it. He began to tremble. Perspiring... he began to fear. The T.C. then said... "Sir..." "You searched everywhere..." "but..." "you never checked that right side pocket." "Shouldn’t you search the pocket as well?" "You might find it there.” You know what the learned man said to that? What did he say? "Please." "Don’t make me search that pocket." "If the ticket is not there, then the hope of finding it is lost." "Let the ticket remain unfound." "But the hope, let the hope stay alive." "Please." Wha…what does that mean? It means… It’s time. Time for? Hmm? Shall we go? I must have been ten years old at the time. A fair, just like this one, had come to town. Free rides for all kids! I… I wanted to be there so badly… to take this ride... and fly higher than everyone else! But appa wouldn’t let me. I cried and threw a tantrum. Appa then thrashed me around. He said it was a bad place. He said that any kid who walked in, will get lost. I stopped crying. I yielded to appa. Then to my family. Then later, in the course, I listened to every nobody. And then at last... I had stopped listening to myself. I feel now, more than ever. I should have gone to that fair. At least for once... I should have just disappeared from everyone’s sight. One thing… All this…is real, right? Oh wow! What is all this? Artworks. My artworks. Hmm… You may call it tattoo as well. What’s a tattoo? Like an impression? You may say so. Permanent impression... Of one's life... On their own body. You know what my life would be? My lunch box... Office bag... Table and files. Now, take it easy, Mr. Sathyamurthy! Sathya… Sathya… Hey Sathya… Sathya… (Office invocation song) Sathya… Hey Sathya… What are you doing here? They’re waiting for you at the function. How long does this take... To kick in? (muffled distant voice) Now let’s invite SM sir onto the stage. Draw a tattoo on me. Your best artwork. Draw it on me. One thing... Is this all real? You’ve just opened your eyes to all this. Must be real. Isn’t it? [Devotional Bhajana Song] Where to? I've work to do. You skip bhajana group every Saturday. What now? Taking my towel for a shower at sea. Don't act too smart. Haven't you heard about Mohan anna? He went missing on a full moon like today. Remember? Mohan anna didn't go missing. Then? He couldn't bear his wife's torture and escaped Yeah, like that's true. -Of course it is. It's full moon tonight. Please go to the bhajana mandali. Take me on a bike ride please. This is mine! NO! That's mine. Go wear your shorts, I'll give it back. My brother has worn my shorts. Please give that back. Does the whole family wears the same pair of shorts? Only my brother and I. Dad's short don't fit us. Please give. Crazy family! You brat! Let's take this up tomorrow. Howdy? Hello. How are you? You love the beach, don't you? You're always half an hour early. I got late due of work. Did those guys trouble you? Those idiots are jobless. And you? Huh? Do you have a job? So, what next? We'll do whatever you like. Are you crazy? Do you have nothing else to do in life? What have you decided about our future? All you want is a secure future, right? I'll take care of that. How? -What do you mean? What are you going to do for a living? How are you going to fend for us? Bringing me to a secluded place for your shenanigans isn't enough. -How will you earn? I will do something. Please stop taunting me. Oh, why? So that you can start? You're an Δ$$λΘŁΣ! What is your problem? You can stay here if you like. Else you can go die, for all I care. Why should I die? I hope you die, Δ$$λΘŁΣ! All you want is physical intimacy. Since that's not happening, I might as well die, ain't it? Shut up! Get out of my sight. You get lost! Are you even a man? Go away! We are over! I'll slipper you if you pester me again. I won't even come to your funeral if you die. Is that so? You will not come to my funeral, huh? Fine then. Rashmi! I'm going to die. Rashmi! I swear, I will jump. Rashmi! I'm going to do it Rashmi! Rashmi! Hey you! Get the hell out of here. Vini, Wake up already! Don't make me splash water on you. Get me groceries from the stores. [groans in frustration] Oh, you're up already? I yelled at you for no reason. Go to the store and get groceries, will you? 100 grams of coriander should do. Don't buy more. Why are we shopping these again? Didn't I get them yesterday? What nonsense are you speaking? I had to borrow supplies from our neighbor. Move your Δ$$ and go buy them. Don't forget the change. -Okay. How much? -70 rupees. Sir, I don't have change. -What do we do then? You're giving me ₹2000 note for a ₹70 ride. Ask the shopkeeper. Shailesh Anna. The grocery list. I've a different brand. Is that okay? Shailesh Anna, -Yes. Do you have change for ₹2000? Oh, the big currency! Did you mint money in Dubai? You've to admit this note is a nuisance. Nonsense! Do you even know how many underprivileged have benefited from this? The underprivileged really benefited during "tiller is the owner of the land" reform. Your people trusts only that political party. Give others a chance and time too. Do we need to fight now? I've come home from Dubai after 3 years. Who's fighting? It's a healthy debate. Also, my passport is ready. Don't leave me behind. How can I forget you? -Hurry up! Even Raghu said the same before leaving to Dubai. When are you heading back to Dubai? In 3 months. -Alright. Shailesh Anna, if he saying he just got back, then who did we see yesterday? Who? Wasn't he here yesterday too, holding a ₹2000 asking for change? He is visiting after 3 years. What are you blurting? Still hungover from last night? Sudhee! Your wallet is here. Oops! Finders keepers, huh? Thanks brother. [Woman crying....] [....on TV] Pass me the remote. Don't you have anything else to do? You watched this already. What do you mean by "watched this already?" Didn't he die yesterday episode? Your jaw dropped. Give me the remote. What are saying? Is he going to die now? TV: These are my last words to you. You've given me everything, except love. You don't have to worry about me anymore. I be long gone before this note reaches you. Here you go. Dammit. They'll kill her next. [Devotional Bhajana Song] Where to? Can you take me on a bike ride? Please? Hello. So, what next? I'm leaving if you have nothing to say. We'll do whatever you like. Are you crazy? Do you have nothing else to do in life? What have you decided about our future? All you want is a secure future, right? I'll take care of that. How? Tell me! I feel like this has happened before. -What? Like a deja vu. -Listen. Don't switch topics again. You avoid it every time I bring it up. Now tell me.... What are you going to do for a living? How are you going to fend for us? Bringing me to a secluded place for your shenanigans isn't enough. How will you earn? -What is your problem? You can stay here if you like. Else you can go die, for all I care. Why should I die? I hope you die, Δ$$λΘŁΣ! All you want is physical intimacy. Shut up! Get out of my sight. You get lost! Are you even a man? Go away! We are over. I'll slipper you if you pester me again. I won't even come to your funeral if you die. Is that so? Rashmi! I'm going to die. Rashmi! Mohan anna? went missing on a full moon like today.

There's this beach You know.... the one with the rock If you jump off it, it's very deep It's dark with water all around When you open your eyes, you are alive I went back in time and life was waiting for me To jump or not to jump That's the magic So if I jump off that rock, the days starts again? Yup! I'd rather die than believe this. It's worth a try. Let's go home. Pradeep! [Phone vibrating] I'm leaving now. Where else. Near the lighthouse. It's a good place for him to have fun. Alright!

Is the water heated? Howdy? Hello. You love the beach, don't you? Those idiots are jobless. Do you have a job? So, what next? This journey is heading towards victory A journey that heads backwards shall not survive A new emotion has arisen A new beginning is here Oh you've left? Okay okay. I will see you here. Have they picked him up? Yes Sir. They just did. Good...and the students are all here? Yes Sir, they have all assembled in the auditorium. Look, ensure nothing goes wrong in today's event. Don't worry, Sir. It is all under control. Hey...Jacob Sir! Sir, excuse me for a minute. How are you, Sir? I'm doing good. I'm also really happy to see you. It had been a really long time since I stepped out of home. Since I read about this event on the newspaper... I immediately called you. Come on, Sir...let's have a cup of coffee and head to the auditorium. Okay. Sir, I'll just... Sure, go ahead. So... How come you guys decided to invite Mr. Parameshwar Rangaswamy this time? The students really admire him. So, we decided to invite him. So...Sir... How come you decided to show up at our College Event all of a sudden? No specific reason... I had read of Rangaswamy on the newspaper... and I was curious to listen to him in person. You must be getting late. You carry on. Tell me the way to the restroom... I'll find my way to the auditorium from there. Let's go? Who the hell has kept this here? Dude, what is this? Sir... I have kept the bricks there because it is windy. The latch on the door isn't working. If I close the door, it will get jammed...it is hard to open it if it does. I'm aware of that. Can't you think of a better way to fix it? I'll check, Sir. Quick! The guest will be here in 15-20 mins. He will be brought in here. Think of something and fix this before that. Have you reached and parked the car? Yes...yes...I'm coming there. Didn't I buy that for you last week? I'm not buying that again. No, sweetie. I'll be late. Sit with Mom and finish your home work. I'll talk to you later. Need to go. I'll talk to you later. Sir, Mr. Parameshwar is waiting in the boardroom. I'll escort him when it is time. Sir, what time will we wrap up? 40 mins of his talk followed by Q&A. Don't let the students irritate him with too many questions. Be mindful of that... ensure that he is dropped home. Yes, I am inside. Oh...is it? Is it time now? Can we go the auditorium? They will take atleast half an hour to open this door. Rajeev just called me. Yes...what happened? Yeah...he mentioned. Nonsense... What time is the seminar? You told me to be here at 11:00. I hate being late. I don't care! You think this is funny? You seem to be having fun. I'm sure it is a big deal for you... to be stuck in a room with me. You're homophobic, aren't you? It didn't seem that way with what you just said. Why are you messing with me? I was just pulling your leg... I'm not going to disturb you. Near the table... I have a new packet in my car. I can get it for myself. I quit smoking too...just a week ago... But this isn't as effective as cigarettes... This is the only option we have right now. Aren't you very active on Social Media? Why do you ask? Do you also follow me on Facebook, Twitter & Instagram? Oh God! No way! I couldn't get past the week. Off late, hasn't the term 'news' reduced to... (tries to recall the term) All you guys want is for the news to start trending, isn't it? I have absolutely no interest in having a conversation with you. Don't take advantage of the fact that I'm not saying anything to you. I didn't mean to offend you... I just spoke my mind... No thank you... Well, we have nothing else to do now... I want know your perspective on this too... Well, you are partially right about Facebook. FB gives everyone a platform to express their views. Right from... ...you can find an expert opinion on these on Facebook. However... If you think a media conglomerate banks only on FB shares to survive... I see no difference between you and those nitwits who post statuses. For a news channel to run...we need viewers. When an average guy... switches on the TV at prime time after a long day at work... he sees the news on it and is relieved that his life isn't as miserable as the ones shown on news channels. It is bloody easy to trigger their senses. ...that is human nature. And isn't the burden of social media or news channels. Mark Zuckerberg, the Founder of FB... started FB with one main vision. To connect the world. He wasn't bothered by how people were going to use that. News is just like that. We give the content to the people. How they choose to use it, is their prerogative. And these days... Which is why we package the news in a way that it trends. But the ones ensuring that it trends... isn't us. It is the viewers. I'm impressed with your confidence. Not just impressed, I'm also jealous. Listening to what you're saying... it makes me feel like the world is functioning exactly the way it should. Who are we to think otherwise? What you are saying... is correct. The power seems to have gone out. Just what we needed... Let me tell you a story? In the end of the story... I will ask you a question. I'm curious find out your answer. I won't take too much of your time. Besides, it doesn't seem like there is too much time either. Okay, tell me... not that I have an option. Even if I refuse, you will cajole me into listening to you. There was a boy... ...like... He was a star in all competitions and co-curricular activities. He idolised the Editor-in-Chief of a famous news channel... One night,... on the way back from a Journalism Workshop. While walking home after he got off the cab... he saw someone lying unconscious on the road. He went closer to inspect... it was a girl... I'm don't want to describe the condition she was in. He immediately took her to the hospital... he waited for her family to come there. Her parents reached. He explained everything to her parents and left the hospital. That incident wasn't reported in any newspaper or news channels. He felt the urge to do something about it. He went to the police station to file a complaint... the cops said they would file a complaint only if the victim lodged it. After giving it much thought, he decided to reach out to his favorite Editor-in-Chief. And...? What happened next? What do you think? The news channel got what they wanted... and everybody got a topic to debate on. Everybody passed their own judgement about that girl. Right from the panelists on news channels... to the people on social media. They even questioned the boy's character. That's when he realized... ...Everyone from the editor he idolized... to the 'average working class viewer'... ...saw the news on TV and wrote a status about it. He stopped going to college... refused to speak to anyone. He felt guilty about making her a household topic. He didn't step out of his house. What is that? What the hell is this? Oh! This is a prank show, isn't it? Where is the camera hidden? Sir, I'm talking to you! Put that away please. I'm talking to you! What the hell is this? Come, sit down. The story isn't over yet. That boy had a professor. Ever since his death... there is a question haunting that professor. I understand that you're upset. But think about what you are doing. Tell me your answer now. Whose fault was this? The news channel's... or his professor's? Or...? Is it theirs? Your answer will decide who should die. The survivor will stay trending on news channels for the next three days. Long live the revolution! Long live the revolution! isn't just a phrase It is an important chapter of the Indian Independence Movement. Every Indian's breath ! The dawn of the 19th century.

Destiny had written a gory fate to those who were imprisoned. The burning desire of the revolutionaries' vengeance was in lookout for the right opportunity. (Mahatma Gandhi's speech on Radio) Our people are caught. Four among them are dead in the forest. Welcome Sir, Please come in. Sir, please be seated. Give me a shave. It’s hot as hell! Yes Sir, today is the hottest day. Appears to be three days beard. He must have been in the forest. Face is also tanned. Sir ! I have not seen any officer in beard. Does your team also have it ? Yes. It must be same. Don’t worry, I will send them here for shave. We searched 3-4 days in the forest. We have caught the main ones. We killed few of them in the forest. Now, only few are alive. But soon they all will be dead ! How many did you catch Sir? We had to go pretty deep into the forest. Few are caught. The remaining few escaped. Not one comes out of this alive. Not ONE! People of Paduvarahalli must have learnt a lesson from what we did other day! Yes… Sir… How did you feel the other day? It was good. Wasnt it? Yes… Sir… It was good. I had never seen him this close. Once he had ordered the entire town to assemble at the ground. I remember only seeing his back. I could not see him properly as I was in agony of loosing my countrymen and close ones. Who else can do such barbaric act in front of the entire town? He is Kaalappa. One of our own but loyal to the company! He is the one who is killing all the patriots of Paduvarahalli ! I feel very tired. Wake me up if I fall asleep I have lots to do in the evening Are you planning to do something similar like last time sir ? Not yet thought about it? Suggest me something, if it’s good, let's do it. What do you say ? Sure sir. What if the group gets to know about his visit here? What do I answer them? This man is not aware that I am connected to the rebel group. He has killed my own and he is asking me for suggestions for today. Oh, he should not have come here. For generations our family are the best barbers in and around the town. We take pride in our work. I need to be as cautious as I am with any of my customer. This three days worth beard is a challenge to my skill. My job is to give him a good shave. Don’t forget to assemble at the ground at six in the evening. Did you decide what you will do with the captives sir? Not yet. However I will ensure not to disappoint anyone. How can someone be so calm when one hasn’t finalised the plans to execute. He has killed many of my countrymen. Now further plans to execute few more in the evening. God have given me a golden chance to stop him. My razor is responding beautifully today. Beard is coming off like butter. Even If I missed slightly, I could have made a cut. Its almost done. Oh! What am I thinking? To give a good shave to this monster who killed many patriots of Paduvarahalli ! I can’t let him go alive from here. This is my chance to take revenge on behalf of the martyer friends. Our fight is for the country and it’s freedom. Justice will be served if I kill him here. His life is in my hands now. It is very easy, just a cut near the throat and he will be dead. His death will be an example not just for Paduvarahalli but even for my country. No. Once I slit his throat, blood will spill all over. What if someone notices me? I will have to flee the town with my family before anyone notices this. I will be tagged as a coward who killed an unharmed person. I will be disgrace to my family and my profession. Oh God, what a moral dilemma? A duel mind cant kill a person. I am not a monster like him. I am just a secret informer to rebel group, not a murderer. He is my customer, giving him a shave is my job! This is the ethics of my job! Sir. Sir? Sir. Good shave. I knew you are one among the rebel group. I came here for shave to find out what would you do ? My team warned me that you would kill me. Listen carefully. Killing isn’t easy as one thinks ! I follow orders. I am just doing my job!
