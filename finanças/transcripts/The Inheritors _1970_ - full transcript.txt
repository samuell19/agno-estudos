THE HEIRS SAO MARTINHO FARM JULY 1930 Sao Martinho was the capital of the sesmaria. One time it was a guarantor to the empire when the emperor borrowed money from England. But then they abolish slavery. And managed to end the monarchy. Now I prefer to see our country suffocated by the rotten air of our warehouses than letting it fall into the hands of a band of irresponsible cowboys. The fuse is always lit, Senator. The devil lit it in the beginning of time. Did you already forget about 1917? The Bolsheviks! This crisis will end... If they let the reputable men take care of it. And you, Senator... You were elected with our money. You must remain faithful to the president we elect. It's your duty. It's time to listen to the practical men, Mr Almeida. The government will no longer buy your surplus of coffee. The president didn't quit! And the coffee will rot in the warehouses, unless... Unless what, Senator? Unless we change the course of history. The fuse is already lit. And the revolutionaries are committed to buying the Sao Paulo surplus of coffee. In return for our support... You came here looking for my support, didn't you? If Sao Paulo adheres to the revolution there won't be a single shot fired. The president is being pressured by foreign countries. We aren't the only ones who are dissatisfied. The landowners are out of work. The port is closed. And the people are impatient. It's necessary to suffocate the people's vocation for anarchy. If the revolution happens, Senator, the people have the duty to shoot you. You, me, all of us! Just like they did with the Tsar of Russia! No, this is a democratic revolution. They just want universal suffrage and a little more freedom. The adventure of power! They abolished monarchy and now they're going after the republic! They will never stop! Times have changed, Mr Almeida. I changed, Senator. When the empire freed the slaves they should compensate the landowners. But the emperor didn't care. The landowners used the politicians to create the republic. And the politicians thought they were the ones that created the republic. The senator thinks that if we aren't in favor of this revolution we will be destroyed. However, we are the blood that runs in the veins of this country. It will only happen if we want it to. But the fuse is already lit. And we still don't know whether or not it's worth letting it explode. The president will know how to keep order. We have to be careful. It's always hard to know exactly where our interests lie. Hey! They killed João Pessoa in Recife. The patriots of all states rebel against the assassination of a great leader of the liberal opposition... Asking the people to rebel... Electoral fraud... It's useless to run away I will love you I will love you until I die SAO PAULO TEN YEARS LATE The sacrifice of Joao Pessoa was in vain! The heroes of 1930 were betrayed! I hate those who gather in public. I hate those who forget they don't taste the blood of people. But Getulio Vargas, inspired by Nazi-fascism that dominates Europe, has become a tyrant! His New State's dictatorship persecutes, arrests and tortures those who have the courage to disagree with it. The police! Down with the fascist dictatorship of Getulio Vargas! The police's here! Help me, please! Let's go. You can drop me here. Thank you. Keep this. It's very instructive. PEOPLE OF SAO PAULO! ARM YOURSELF AGAINST FASCIST DICTATORSHIP! PEOPLE OF SAO PAULO! ARM YOURSELF AGAINST FASCIST DICTATORSHIP! They announced and guaranteed That the world was going to end Because of that my family began to play And they even said that the sun would rise just before midnight Because of that, tonight there was no music at the favela I believed in this mumbo jumbo I thought the world was going to end I began to say my farewells and without delay I began to enjoy myself I kissed who I shouldn't kiss I held the hand of those I didn't know I danced a samba wearing swimsuit But finally the world didn't end They found us! The police found out that we made the pamphlets and they closed the workshop! The party wants you two to split and leave Sao Paulo. I go to the south. The party is strong in Rio Grande, and you? I don't know yet. I don't have an agenda. The party needs people everywhere! I know I can be useful there! Useful? You can be useful everywhere too, Jorge. The party has an agenda. This is the "democratic revolution" stage. With our alliance with the liberal opposition and the progressive sectors of the bourgeoisie, we can start a national organization against Nazi-fascism. The country will enter the war. There will be elections and our party will win. There won't be any elections with Getulio Vargas in power. - But at least the war – - The great world powers are fighting for the right to colonize us. They fight for our slavery. Jorge... The party guarantees that there will be elections. We will have to present candidates. You can be one of them. So be careful with what you say, watch yourself. Me? You are a leader, Davi Martins. I'm not. To have integrity... is to have an agenda? Isn't it? "They put the rest of Brazil's monkeys in a cage." "The fountains fall like old men." "In the lakes, the snobs and the soldiers" "Weak generations" "Birds that no one sees in the trees" "Snapshots and cold beers" "Families" Shut up! "There goes a little boat loaded with adventurers" "There goes a little boat loaded with doctors" I can't continue If there is no booing. Jorge Ramos! You're under arrest! Who cares about this nonsense that you write! I want names! This "Leon", for example. Who is this guy that organizes meetings with students and workers? Mr Alfredo Medeiros, owner of the newspaper where you work. How are doing, my son? I came to get you out of here. When this war is over, the world will become very small. And in this corner of the world, there will be no place for those who think like your friends. Your cause won't be affected if one of them is arrested. Now, I... I don't belong to your group. if I disappear, My newspaper is over! Hundreds of people like you will be unemployed. The articles against fascism... Don't be a fool! If you don't talk, someone will! Why sacrifice yourself? "Leon"... Who is he? Come with me, Jorge Ramos. Come with me. You aren't like the others. I promise you. I know what I'm saying. Today you must bury... Here... Your youth! It's over now. The light on. What do you want from me? I want names. This "Leon"... We want a great future for this country! I promise nothing will happen to them. It's too bright in here. "Leon"... is our contact with the student organizations and the unions. He works... as a photographer... at the National Newspaper. His real name is... Davi. Davi Martins. Do you think you're responsible for the miseries of the world? More names. Jorge Ramos, you're not responsible... Give me more names! Sir, we only publish the truth. How much does a full page truth cost? The machines are new. The paper and ink are imported. Then there's the social security, the minimum wage... We will pay you anything. The newspaper has only to prove that my cousin Joaquim Campos de Almeida is crazy and leading Sao Martinho Farm to its destruction. Davi Martins was arrested. I already knew it. - But the sheriff promised me – - He gave me his word! What did you expect? It's done, get over it. Take care of yourself now! - If they find about it – - So what? You must have suffered a lot. See you soon Mr Medeiros. Remember, we will pay you anything. How about spending some time out of town? Today I wrote in my diary, "I found a friend among my collaborators." "A friend who will bring me joy." Joaquim Campos de Almeida? If they sent you here, I'll give you one minute to get out. Who's they? I'm a reporter from Sao Paulo. Jorge Ramos, I work for the National Newspaper. It's not them. It's getting dark. They won't come today. I'll travel to the south. To Parana. My newspaper wants a full report on the coffee situation. Sao Martinho is one of the oldest farms in the state, isn't it? The Campos de Almeida family has been the landowners for a long time. - Can I go inside –– - No! I wasn't expecting visitors. Maybe another day. I will ask they to clean it up. But you can have a coffee if you want. After all... I came because of it. I remember! I was wondering if we met before. You hid me from the police in Sao Paulo! In 1930, Getulio Vargas tied his horse to the obelisk. Then he entered the Government Palace holding the saddles. With the noise of the spurs. The smell of manure under the boots. Everyone has betrayed. The politicians. The farmers too. And they bought this country's conscience in exchange for the coffee. "The October's soldier brought in his backpack the roots of communism." Said the Archbishop of Sao Paulo. And I warned that Getulio Vargas was the devil that was going to turn our children into beasts! These are strange times, when one must shed blood for what's fair. One day the engineers came here to take some pictures. They wanted to examine the land. Because my family took legal action to divide these lands. They fled with bullets flyings over their heads! I closed Sao Martinho's doors and if they try to enter it, they will die! But they start to use an airplane. They take pictures from above. Late in the afternoon I heard the cicadas singing. Now it's the crickets. This country is doomed. Naked we came and naked shall we return. Naked we came... Do you remember that I... We buried our youth. You look beautiful. The loneliness… "To see the fields and the river, It isn't enough to open the window." "To see the trees and the flowers, It isn't enough not to be blind." "It is also necessary to have no philosophy." The angels protect us from the dangers of body and soul. They pray for us and exhort us to be good. On the last day, Christ will come back to judge men. To consummate the work of redemption. The good ones will receive the proper honor. and the bad ones the well-deserved prison. In times of trouble faith is our comfort. Please... They're here. For a long time... I'm going back to the capital. I'm going to write about you and Sao Martinho. I promise you they won't succeed. Don't! Don't tell them. Don't write about what you saw here. You need new blood around here. Someone to protect you and to take care of the farm. You said the police chief promised it! - He tried to escape. - It's a lie! You know it isn't true! He was murdered in prison. Murdered! The National Newspaper is unbiased! - I don't care! - What do you want from me? Get over it. Don't you understand that it's my fault? Don't worry. We quickly forget things in this country. His death will be forgotten with the New State. "I need to see you." "Come to the farm as soon as you can." "Thank you." The country is as rotten as my coffee! If they succeed I will burn the farm with me inside it! I've been summoned, Jorge. They don't have the right to do it and they don't deserve to hear me! I prefer death! They will see the flames from wherever they are! I'm lonely and tired but not afraid! Jorge. I can't forget what you told me. "New blood." If I had a grand-son as my heir... Maybe I could save the farm. Maybe they would... leave me alone. If they do, I could fix Sao Martinho. One day it will prosper again. I'm sure about it. Jorge. I'm asking you to marry my daughter. I saved some money, I can pay you for this favor. Just have faith and Sao Martinho will succeed again. And I'm not afraid either, Mr Almeida. OCTOBER 30, 1945 From the battlefields in Europe, OCTOBER 30, 1945 From the battlefields in Europe, our soldiers brought freedom with them. The dictatorship banished forever in our society... The president of the Supreme Court... was pressured by the provisional government... The constituent assembly secured the next general elections. The people on the streets celebrate the victory of democracy and tranquility reigns. Something is about to happen. Those who betrayed and those who were betrayed. They will come to me. And they'll tell me I was right. They will come and they will beg me to stay in Sao Martinho. Don't count on that, Mr Almeida. How so? Getulio Vargas was overthrown. He also belongs to the past. And Sao Martinho? Evil is fertile and this war brought us progress. Now the country will need steel industries, roads, oil and development. And what do you suggest? Make a deal with them and sell the farm. We use the money to invest in the industry. Did you came here for this? I gave you my daughter and I gave my name to your son. They will talk to me like they used to. They will come to me. "You fulfilled your years of purgatory in Sao Martinho" "and the death of Davi Martins was buried with the memory of the New State." "As you said in your letter," "it's now time to start again." "The job is yours." "You will move to Rio de Janeiro to work as a correspondent." "Your friend, Alfredo Medeiros." Tereza found this in your bedroom. Rio de Janeiro... This Davi... Did you come here because of him? Naked we came... Jorge, you gave life to the dead matter of my dreams. I gave you the heir you needed. You've betrayed me like everyone else! But you did your part. You will take from here what is yours. Rachel is your wife and you will take her with you! But your son will grow up here! And one day he will do what you couldn't do! I won't be alone this time! Go away! You don't see he's crying? Jorge! Your son will stay here and I will never be alone again! FOUR YEARS LATER There are beautiful beaches full of light Getulio had just been overthrown. Politicians were already asking for his support in the elections. But now he speaks as if he's from the opposition! Getulio's right this time. One day the ore we export will come back in the form of handcuffs. Take it easy, Jorge. I'm here to see this gringo. But I also need to talk to you. Something tells me that Getulio is coming back. I hope not, but... If he will come back... We need to stay close to his party. If the old man agrees to be a candidate, he will be invincible! - But I have other businesses with friends –– - And clients? And clients. That's why I want you to go there, Jorge. As a reporter, without drawing attention. If he will really run for president, offer him the newspaper in my name. Tell him that we support him! When? Now. We need to be the first ones to go to the other side. To the president-elect, Getulio Dornelles Vargas! It comes from a distant drumming sound A steady beat The baiana's way of walking Her movements and attitude All the grace of the palm trees Swinging, all tall and sleek The victory of Getulio Vargas is a victory for the National Newspaper! Even in this uncertain time, he had the courage to run again! For the great future of this country! A giant of the Americas! This was a victory for the people! And we're the people! Jorge Ramos! You are not like the others. Gentlemen! I name my collaborator and friend Jorge Ramos, director of the National Newspaper. Congratulations! See, I don't forget those who stand by my side. President Vargas... President Vargas, will come to power, to no longer compromise. He will rule with the people at his side. The real people. That's why he gave a radio station to some new friends. It will give him popular and nationalist support. I can't accept the position you've just offered me. Because I'm the director of the new People's Radio. My first meeting with him... The first interview... The decision to be a candidate... We've become good friends during the campaign. At his side, time didn't pass. So many hectic days... - Do you think that –– - Why didn't you leave already? Because I know you have something to say. My newspaper would be yours. You could do whatever you wanted with it. I was going to make you the country's most powerful man. The real people live in rural areas. They don't read it. Soon the television will be here. And it will control this illiterate country. Why have you betrayed me, Jorge? - You should have seen –– - Why did you do that? One day Getulio told me, "Jorge, they talk a lot about the people but they don't believe in them." "But I know they exist." "That's why they will never win." It's a lie! It's a bunch of lies! You don't understand and you never will. You know... we can be enemies tomorrow. Don't you? So? It's unavoidable. I'm not like you. Yes, you are! The people, the people, the people! Power is all that matters. And now it's in your hands, isn't it? I'm not like you! We're the same, Jorge. We worked together before. Remember? Yes, him... You and me... Together. We killed Davi Martins. Remember? The power, Jorge... I hope you at least know how to use it. One thing you taught me: It's impossible to change the world the way I wanted to. No one can clean a house from outside of it. But at my door... My door was wider! My door was safer! Much safer! Jorge! PEOPLE'S RADIO AUGUST 1954 Attention. You're on air! - Is he no longer coming? - Don't worry. He told you he would come. - Armando is always punctual. - I know, I know. But he's never been so late. - Something must have happened to him. - That's nonsense! But what could have happened? He said, "I spent time uselessly carrying water in baskets." "But now I'm ready for the mission that awaits me." "If the people want it." "Only love builds for eternity." And Getulio Vargas is moving the country towards eternity. What would be like Living without your love My mouth without your kisses My soul without your warmth What would be like Without the diffuse light of the violet lamp It would never glow again At nights like those ones Searching A new delusion maybe, I don't know Another home I don't want anyone else other than the one I dreamt My love No one would be happier than me If you love me again If we combine our affections What would be like Living without your love My mouth without your kisses My soul without your warmth Murderers! They are lying to you! They are the enemies of the people! MUD SEA They are the enemies of the people! MUD SEA We fight against this corrupt government! MUD SEA We fight against this corrupt government! They had the leader of the opposition killed! It's a lie! That's what your bosses want you to think. The murderers need to be punished. They betrayed the president with this crime. Those who try to deceive the people are traitors. Those who speak about cleaning the honor of the nation have always been exploiting the country. Don't you remember? He said" Today no one else can stop the march of this country. Nobody. It's time to lift the veil of truth and I can assure you, My duty is to avoid denationalizing the country. The newspaper was with the government! - And now –– - It was Medeiros! The only solution, the resignation of the man who has no more conditions to govern. Have you read this? It's about the radio and its deals with the government. Medeiros... Finally... The country is against the president! Even his friends! Medeiros, friend of the President? It's me who he wants to eliminate! He wants to take revenge on me, even if he has to overthrow Getulio Vargas. He said: "It's no longer possible to maintain a society divided between the small group of rich people and the majority of the country that's poor!" "To fight that, we only need our idealism and our mutual trust." "I didn't fail you!" - It's a lie! - Murderer! Coward! If only he'd said that before. They wouldn't let him be the president. Now for the first time he's going to have real enemies. Because he has chosen his side. Our idealism. Our mutual trust. "I didn't fail you!" The oil is ours. The old man's smile makes us work The old man's smile motivate us It's inevitable that we become enemies, Alfredo Medeiros. Because I'm not like you. I hid it for a long time. But now I vomit it on you. I see a future with him. And I want to know how far I can go. I'm too old to be demoralized. And I no longer have reason to fear death. My determination is to maintain order and to respect the constitution. Under these conditions I'm willing to step back. They will want more! Your resignation! Your exile! Your death! What I fear is... the impossibility of dying. It's always too late. "To the anger of my enemies, I leave the legacy of my death." I'm sorry for not having done for the poor, everything I wanted. What kind of people... I may be able to change the course of history. If the blood flows on the hand that holds the dagger and the key... Why the people don't see the truth? Does everything have to be done without them? If the birds of prey want someone's blood, if they want to keep sucking the Brazilian people blood, I offer myself in sacrifice. What kind of people is this! My sacrifice will remain in their souls. I accept my involuntary fate. What about me and the radio? Your friends will be eliminated by your vanity. Your resignation will be our shame. Serenely, I take my first step on the road to eternity. I leave life to enter history. It's a lie! We need to be alive to make history. What exists is us! The certainty of life! Jorge. Jorge. I called you here because you still have not betrayed me. Go back to your radio station and tell the people that I will only leave the office after I die. Then he said, "I will only leave the Government Palace after I die". Then I said that there are some faithful men at his side. And that if the people weren't able to understand it, we would make history without the people. But... He was lonely. And loneliness is terrible. He was alone and unhappy. Because he is the only one who's aware of what's happening. And he accepted his fate. This country is too lyrical for him, Eugenia. He lied. He also doesn't believe in the people. If so he would not give up! He would resist! Be careful, Jorge. You said yourself... his enemies are stronger now. Medeiros came to see me. He made me a proposal. Don't you understand what he represents? He sold our consciousness to all the corporations of the world. He said there are only two ways now. Resignation or impeachment. And when this government falls... they will drop the deals with the radio. But he wants to save us. He proposes that you change sides. You will stay on the radio... with him as a partner. It's a betrayal. You said that when the president decided not to resist, his friends would leave him. Isn't it a betrayal? Or do you choose to resist? Alone. In the name of what? You came early. Did you talk to Medeiros? - We have time for a coffee. - The president... Getulio committed suicide. What? He killed himself in the morning. A shot in the chest. The birds of prey. You'd forgotten that he was the leader of the people. People need to know why Getulio killed himself. He was good! Getulio was good! The birds of prey! People need to know why he killed himself. I see it now, my end is near They don't fight me, they slander me and for sure it's an atrocious persecution They don't give me the right of defense They need to keep me quiet They want to prevent me from defending the people Like I always did Compelled in my deep disgust I accept my forced destiny They don't want the people to be free They don't want the working class to be happy But the people, whom I have been slave of, - shall not be anybody's slave again. - It's him, Jorge Ramos. - He stayed with him until the end. - He's a nice guy. The country needs more people like him. I take with me one thing: I leave life to enter history BRASILIA APRIL 21, 1960 We built this road, this brave lion. To face the sun when it face us. We've made a wake-up call. And they came from the poor regions. From distant lands. From uninhabited places. God didn't build this city. How are you? How's it going? And you? I'm fine. Is everything ok? Jorge. Jorge. I've been waiting to ask you this for a long time. Did you meet him? Did you meet him before the suicide? I went to offer him the solidarity of the people. But he had already chosen solitude. My heart is in pieces It makes me anxious on this day Ah, this nation. It's something tragic amidst the joy. And this uneasiness of my soul I'm looking for a green parrot of the color of this country. Jorge, why are we not together? I don't get it. This television channel, for example. Why we fight? It makes no sense! If we connect our friends this concession will be immediately ours! Ours, Jorge. It wouldn't be the same thing. You can't keep avoiding me! It's people's fault, Jorge! When Getulio was with the people for the first time, he was abandoned! Your people make a lot of mistakes! What do they know about power? But even if they don't understand it, what has to be done has to be done. Then they will be strong and will continue alone. The people, strong? Be careful, Jorge Ramos. My friends advertise on your radio. I will think about it. I need time to think. He's figuring out that what it's starting to rise before us is the capital of a new civilization! Greetings to the atlantic capital! The capital of Brazil! The capital of hope! BACK TO SAO MARTINHO Davi. This is Joaquim. Your older brother. 30 years, Jorge. Disgusted by the air I was breathing. But at least I saw the demon die. And he died before me. Jorge... don't you want to know why I asked you to come to Sao Martinho after all these years? I have abandoned him many times. I didn't deserve to have him by my side any longer. Lord, deliver us from the evil and from the fire that consumes my father. I have abandoned him many times. And he was my father. Tomorrow, they will come to take the farm. They won. But they will only find the ashes of Sao Martinho. Mixed with ours. You're crazy! You came too late to Sao Martinho. Jorge! I give you back Joaquim. He will be my arm in this world! So everybody... They will see the evil they have done! Who remember, Jorge? I swore that if they took the farm from me, they would see the flames from wherever they were. May this fire spread through this doomed country! Goodbye! I'm the father... SOME TIME LATER "The anger of my enemies"! Alfredo Medeiros came one more time. But I wanted to stay with you all. And with Medeiros at my side, that would not be possible. 1st ANNIVERSARY OF THE PEOPLE'S TV THE CHANNEL OF PROGRESS Who can forget Getulio Vargas? The hero of the 1930 Revolution! Getulio Vargas, the man who gave Brazil the steel industry. The man who made possible the creation of Brasilia. Getulio Vargas, you were the father of the poor... It was always like this. Because you will live in the hearts of... Alfredo Medeiros. Getulio Vargas. My father. Davi. Davi Martins was his best friend. You said she wouldn't come. Marta's here. They don’t even smile They hug and kiss one another And go their separate ways Dancing and singing Love songs And yet, it’s necessary to sing More than ever, it’s necessary to sing But what are you doing here? Don't you talk? Joaquim, Amadeu is here. The president has been overthrown and has left the country. Congress is electing a new president and the governors have given their support. I came here to... Professor Maia will be arrested. Your father can help. It’s the people who dance Contented with life Happily singing Because there are so many serene things And such grand promises of light So much love to give That we don’t even know about How I wish I could live to see it And frolic in other Carnivals With the beauty Of those Carnivals of the past What lovely songs Professor, you were ruining everything we've patiently built all those years. You think the others are stupid! And now... I can't help you. Mr Ramos! Our ideals, Mr Ramos... Our feelings... The men who believed in you... Their families... We've made a deal with them. - What you did was – - A betrayal. What do you know about this? You should have stayed at home. Politics is for politicians. You see, Professor... Isn't nice to have the right and the left in the same family? Opposition and government under one roof. You lose, Professor. Start to behave like a loser. Excuse-me, are you one of Jorge Ramos sons? Why? I saw you with him here at the theater. No. I'm not. I'm Professor Maia's wife. We've learned that the police would come to get him. He knew that only Jorge Ramos could save him. And Jorge Ramos told him that he could do nothing. There was nothing he could do. Then I heard a shot and I saw the blood dripping from the open wound on his chest. My husband had killed himself. I'm the widow of Professor Maia. Did you... come to kill Jorge Ramos? No. It wouldn’t be fair. Could you please tell me if he is one of Mr Jorge Ramos sons? He's Davi. The beloved son of Jorge Ramos. So many people came to the funeral. People need heroes. Now they want revenge. Just like Getulio. The elections... - There's a seat for the Senate. - But I want to live. To live? We need popular politicians. To calm down the people. They'll support us. Because men like you... are on our side. Maybe I've waited too long. I'm tired of telling others what to do. There's a seat in the Senate. You're now... a popular hero, Jorge Ramos. Here lies Davi de Almeida Ramos. Martyr of justice and truth. And we are his heirs. Jorge Barros... a leader. It's been a long time... You got ahead in life. Did you really go to the south? Do you want to talk about your candidacy? What do you want? We have an agenda. They think I'm the guarantee of peace with the people. If I have the vote of the party... I will certainly win the seat. Your friends... You're all my friends. Your other friends. Do they know about it? They don't need to know. Your support will be spontaneous. How could they find about it if the vote is secret? You were not with us in 45, 54, 61, all these years. Jorge... The paths to power are tortuous. You don't get to it by a straight line. But we'll get there. Together! And we know what to do with power. You were always with our enemies. Intuition. No party can have it. So why do you want our support? To win the election. Without your votes, it will be difficult. And why should we do it? You, of all people! Because I'm the history. And you all live on the trail behind it. You're right. You're right, Jorge Ramos. But one day... The people! My land has palm trees, where the birds sings The birds that sing here, don't sing as they do there Our skies have more stars, our valleys have more flowers I ripped this city from the trees and the rivers. Now I'm welcomed back into its arms. Cement and stone. How much time wasted. This is my place. We will build the future on this city, ahead of the nation! - You can't prove it! - Jorge Barros was arrested! You've made a deal before the elections. We are not just removing him from office. Jorge Ramos. They closed the People's Newspaper. They seized the TV and the radio. They'll confiscate your possessions. You'll go to prison. Jorge Barros... avenged Davi Martins. He wanted to save me from hell. And that's why he decided to speak. It's the only explanation. Transfer your possessions to someone else, before they are confiscated. Leave the country. And come back later to start a new life. Isn't it funny... After all these years, Jorge Barros and I in the same prison. Poor Jorge... It's late. I can't be with you any more. Jorge. There's nothing else to do here. Jorge... I'm not used to losing, Joaquim. Take care of my possessions. I'm leaving the country. I will come back and... You don't care much about politics. Davi was different. But he's dead. And you're alive. - Let's sign the papers for –– - Who you will betray this time? What? To avoid prison. Who will you betray? No one, my son. There's no one else left. - Let's sign the papers. - I can't inherit my own shame. - What do you mean? - I'm not signing anything. What would I say to your victims? To the men you betrayed! To the people that you deceived for so long! What do you know about this country and this people? Oh, Davi, how I miss you... Which one? Davi. Martins? Davi Martins! My grandfather! Getulio Vargas! Medeiros! Professor Maia! Everyone you've betrayed! I'm not responsible for the miseries of the world! I couldn't bear the sumptuous impotence of misery. And because I couldn't face its crazy face... I took a risk. Whenever I could move forward. I had carefully planned my way. But we can't count on the weak. Like Jorge Barros. He was arrested because of me. I told them everything I saw. I'm the arm of your victims. I will live to remember the world of your crimes. My crimes are my victories! Joaquim, why are you killing me? The son must triumph over his father. So time can flows and history can be made. Joaquim! I'm the ghost of your father! Good evening! We're waiting for you. I'm disgusted with the history. How can we go on living? And you? What are you doing here? The first duty of a revolutionary is to make revolution everywhere! To have both the mystical shell and the rational core! I am the son of a mulatto, Aztec and warm continent My heart is bleeding From a continent that sings Blood cools the throat There's nothing to do! There's nothing to do. An open wound on the corpse of the tropics. But I can't do anything! Look at my hands! Anything! I can’t do anything. I can’t! So many times we doubt ourselves before the powerful men. And yet... On the right day... In the right place... The people … The people! Joaquim. Your father killed himself. He killed himself this morning. A shot in the chest. He left a will. You are the only heir. The sole heir. He took revenge on both of us. Jorge found a way out. His possessions are safe. It’s all over now. Goodbye. Goodbye. He laughs at our certainties and our illusions as if we're stupid. I saw him grow, ascend, dominate… But I also saw him weak. Afraid. Falling. I saw him die!
