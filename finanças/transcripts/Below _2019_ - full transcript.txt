What were you doing? They're internet shit, Satin road - or whatever the fuck it is... - Silk road, silk. With the drugs, whatever. Yeah well and that was misrepresented. That was for a friend. Do you know my mate Snout? Thank fuck no. What was the website? I had a dream, I had a dream that people came to my rave, but they didn't pay. They donated to the dream, a better way yeah? In rainbows yeah and people came. And people came. But you know just no on played a button and security role are pingers, so you know it got nicked. I can find my way out of a financial hole, so I got a hold of some software.

Charge viewers, income stream, you know what I'm saying? Income stream, that's gone. But it's stopped working. Markets flooded, celebrity face swaps, you know privacy is a dead business except for like kids and schools and nanny cams.

The golden leaves are falling. She leans into you, you know for warmth. Oh Terry, it's so wonderful. She's a wonderful woman your mum. I know. Everything, she saved my life. I'm not worried about outsiders finding out about the cage. The authorities will just brush it off to lunatics, hackers, bullshit whatever, but if you broadcast from here, that's digital terrorism. Oh Terry I'm living on five bucks a week. I'm swapping stolen cupcakes for smokes and every day in here is like a holocaust movie. Do you really want me here for a year? A couple more fights and I am done. Fuck. The economy's tanked, inflation, everything's Chinese, - property bubble. - It is what I'm saying.

Great, great. - Stick out your tongue. - Sorry? Stick it out. Stick it out, there's a boy, that's it. What now? Thank you, thank you. okay, sorry there's no tobacco, King Ciggy already cashed in all his coupons and Michelle shifted them all on, so there's a new consignment coming in soon, so there's gum. Blink, you blinked. Blinkies out out. You're out, I saw you get out. Thank you thank you, good things, these are good things. It's not me. It's him. He's earned them, the shah of New Haven.

Hook in the water. Really? We did shots. Yeah, I was networking pretty hard. You were indeed man, You also went quite the hack on the nibbly crisps.

No, what happened? Kids these days am I right? Hook number two. Hook number two. Terry said that there's a chance that in a year or two you know maybe getting into Somalia or no Sudan or whatever the fuck it is they call it. There will be no Sudan. I tried, I did try going the more direct route, - but you know... - What do you mean direct? Well I got a hack of personnel files in immigration. I put a couple dozen hooks in the water and I got a hold of this one drone. He's a real ambitious type and I'm working him up. Somebody do something. Oi! Hello. Oh. Spoiler alert. okay I caught a video of him going full choke hold on his chode with a home-made vajayjay, high as fuck knuckles. - What? - Yeah. I don't want to email the video to your mum, okay. I don't want to have to post it on Instagram, 4chan, Reddit. I've got your internet history right here, man. We could have been friends. I have friends at ASIO and in the federal police. Do you have any idea what will...? I'm sure they're as keen as the bomb we dropped on Iran to go through all of that, right. Courts are fun! Look, I'm just looking for you a little data nudge in the right direction. Everyone knows what hackers can do with VFX. Oh right because the Russian government's targeting you, right? Some clerk. 'Hey I didn't do it. It was hackers!' They're they're targeting me. They're looking for data entry, come on. okay yeah, I'll be embarrassed, but you, you'll be arrested for digital terrorism and blackmail. I'm just asking for a little help. Terrorism, blackmail of a government official. That's prison so do it. look please. Just do it. I thought so. You know I'm asking him for help? This will not work. I don't know man, I don't know. I think he might come around. I'm just asking for data entry, like a bit of cut and paste. For visa, you want cut and paste? - Yep - This is illegal. Azad, extreme measures, man. Yeah but nobody get in, understand this? We are buried. I know this. We are buried, living dead, buried under mountain of paper and law, this and that. - I know okay. - Hey. No one get in. The politicians they can't look. They're not to look. Even if they want, they can't see. You understand this? People don't want to see. But maybe I don't know maybe Australian people - Hey, this isn't Australia man. - maybe do something. What do you mean this is not Australia? This isn't Australia. They moved the borders. This land, this land is leased by Timor or Cambodia or Laos or by Piss Corp or Shit Corp or Fuck Knows Corp or whoever it is, they own and run the havens. okay This is the Cayman Islands via Lagos. They change the law man. They moved the line up the map. They changed the law. They changed. okay. This is what it is huh? This is what it is. Hey, hey. Yes. What's all that about then? It's good. It better be. Hey Popeye. - Yeah? - Are you ready for your closeup? Hey I'm not sure about everyone being involved. - Team sport is good. - okay. I see you benched Boner. He's too soft. Terry, here. I want a bigger piece. I do the best with what nature gave me. Whatever this video thing is. I know, eager beaver. - Yeah, I am so. - Me too makes two of us. Do you want to come along later to chill? Do I ever? Terry, good to go. I'm on it, Terry. Good, good, come on, good, you don't have a hood. Good to go. All right. I'm the drummer. I'm the unconscious male... You go. I'll take care of this. I'm wanna stay. I wanna do it. What are we gonna do? - Hitchcock to Patrol. - Boner, copy. Get down the gate, canteen East, There's a solo curfew breach. It's that little mute girl. Wristband please. We need to scan your wristband. Hey. Oi! Get her out of there, for fuck's sake. Don't rub your eye, you fuck. Process, protocol, policy, these are not empty words. Cognitive bias, group-think, reflexive behaviour, all to be addressed in the compulsory online workshop. In circumstances such as these, unfortunate, disappointing, regrettable, we are dealing with an explicit absconsion event. This is when the programmatic specificity that works across the havens throughout the special business zone, it really kicks in. Let's call this what it is, escape attempt. Escape to where? He would not just run off, he has a sister. Yes, I'm assuming full inquiry is underway. The deceased, MEG1583 was dosed on accelerant and had procured a blade. Are you saying he did both? I have a question. Mabel, the office kitchen leader, she's got a question. - Yes Mabel. - Mabel. This has nothing to do with us. okay, well sunlight is a disinfectant and I'd just like to add if an illegal media outfit seeks you out, report it to security immediately. I'm obliged to remind you, it is an offence to not do so. So what's the status with his sister, the girl? Is that addressed to me? No, I've got this. She's got guardians, immediate family, good people. That's not in her file. Ah, we didn't know. It's a cousin of her mother's sister-in-law. All the files were wiped when Iran fell. No documents. And there it is, anything further I'll take on notice and have a lovely day New Haven. Have a super great day. There is a girl at risk, young violently acting out, doesn't speak. Yeah, I want to expedite this too. Meaning what exactly? Culture, mentorship, operational matters. I am required to give you notice. My report will be fast tracked. It is going to the office of the attorney general. My expectation is that it will trigger an informal investigation. Perhaps you could post something on Facebook. Did you give her the soft toy? The kangaroo? I was told you did. Yeah. That was kind. Not really. Fucking Care Bear, probably got a picture of the Ndugu from Uganda on her fridge. Were you with him? No. So so Terry found him on his own, really? I don't know. You know the medical officers aren't available for interview. I didn't even know we had one. I don't know. I have signed statements saying there's a punishment regime around a fight cage. No one cares. She's gonna be okay, right, Zahra? You're gonna make sure she's okay? Sure, I mean she's just been scheduled for her contraceptive implant so all good. What? What? She's a kid She's 13. No birth certificate, that's the policy. I didn't know they did that. Ugh, ugh. - Dougie? - Yeah? Can you come with me? Why? Please, I need someone to come with me. I want to talk about the girl. She needs to be in with a family inside Australia, that's the law right? How many do I have to tell you Dougie? We're not in Australia. She's got a guardian. You know, that's bullshit. If we put that girl in protective care, every single parent will line up to suicide. - Are you for real? - If you showed them a path out, they're gonna take out. That's what we're here to stop. We are the plug up the ass of hope. There is no hope. So don't try anything stupid. Don't get on the leaky boat and drown and no. Don't kill yourself so your kids can get into Australia no. We are the only link in this chain That keeps people alive. Do you know want to see another boat of illegals drown again? The world's a fucked up place, Dougie. We can't always be Mother Theresa. Don't you get all misty-eyed on me. Pony boy. I do understand you know. I have made enough to pay off my debts on the last fight. I am clear. So I just want to go. I want to go home. I just want to go, so can you sort it? No, not yet. I can't stay. If I let you go now like this, you're just gonna fuck it. okay then I quit and I will pay my debts myself. I just need some transport or a vehicle. There is no vehicle. There is no transport. You are here and you can choose to be on the payroll or not. Up to you. Until when? Until I say so. - Listen to Terry. - I just want to go home. Stop Doug. He hasn't told you has he? I don't have to be here now. He surprised me. Here. What? Beautiful isn't it? Picking it up soon. What? Me and Terry, we're gonna go all around everywhere. Terry's so romantic. I wish I met him 20 years ago. Hey, do you know how he paid for it? We're just gonna head off, go wherever we want. - Mum, mum. - Listen to Terry. Do what he says. One of the prisoners died. You can't tell me any of that security stuff. He has a sister. You can't tell me any of those things. It's against the law. You'll be doing a crime. I'll be doing a crime. So stop. Stop okay? Have a look at the brochure. Do you want me to write something different? Yes, something free of ideology. Would you like to dictate it to me? That is exactly the lack of professionalism that has been flagged at the highest level. So what words are you gonna use to say it? Culture is a priority here at New Haven and language is integral. But I'm fired? Of course not. I'd imagine you'd prefer the generous severance package that comes with your formal resignation. Zahra, I have some chocolates and biscuits for you Zahra. look at all these. - The nurse came. - The nurse? I said she won't eat. She won't talk. Zahra. We try. But here. Are they shouting at me? Why are you pretended to be related to her? I try. I don't know. Zahra, I have a DVD player in my bunk, would you like to come and watch it with me?
