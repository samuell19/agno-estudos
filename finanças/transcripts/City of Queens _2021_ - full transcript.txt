[woman reciting] My son is gay. Stands out in a crowd. Does his makeup better than I. My son is gay and I am proud. My son is abused... [attacker 1] Back the fuck off. -[man 1] Back the fuck off. -[man 2] What am I doing? [woman] ...by individuals and crowds [man 1] Delete that. Are you fucking dumb? Delete it. [woman] My son is my son. My son has your spit on his face... [man 1] Back the fuck off. [woman] Your pint over his head. [man 2] Delete that, delete that! [woman] He walks head held high. My son is my son. My son bears the marks of your fists on his face. Carries the scars from your verbal punches. My son is my son and I am proud. This is what happens on a night out. [classical piano playing] [piano continues playing] [drag 1] It starts with getting stressed out about the makeup because the eye lashes aren't gluing down properly. With some disco music on and a bit of Prosecco. No, not Prosecco because I can't afford it -Ehm... -Five pounds from Lidl. What? You left this lidless. [drag 2] It's like a childhood dream basically living in a house where you just play dress up and have sleepovers. Oh, Disco! Beauty blender. Every fucking time. I'm Tommy, I'm 24 and then my drag name is Bimini Bon Boulash. And she jumps into the splits as well all the time. There's not much difference between her and her character to be honest. She's always on the floor, jumping into the splits, picking up honey like-- [laughter] No! Get in your bed. Stay! Yeah, so I had thyroid cancer when I was 17 and then again at 19. It did give me this attitude of ?I don't give a fuck anymore.? Don't care about making a fool of myself anymore falling over, or having one of my balls hanging out like, it's all part of it now. So I think it's given me that broader aspect on life that has allowed me to do drag. I started drag originally when I was selling underwear on Craigslist. And then I created this character called Chuck who was like a masculine character so I guess that was my first experience of drag, and then I kind of from that started from doing the lip sync... started developing a female character called Barbs. Oh my God, Disco's had that one. Okay. I'm Luke, I'm 26, aka Camile Leon. With the Camile Leon, it's like the two together combine to make this reptilian X-Men mutant thing that is my superhero. [laughter] She's loving, she's adorable. We've all got a completely different style of drag. It's amazing. [woman shouting] Oh ladies, don't leave! You look fantastic. [Barbs] We're always together which is nice. That helps the confidence a lot. When you walk out the house with five or six drag queens all stumbling down the road it's a really great way to build confidence. [drag] I never really felt like I belonged. So I just kind of like float around. I usually just get ready on my own. I go to the club with Vinny and Veto who I live with and they don't normally do drag. They do now and then but I normally just go in drag on my own and then I'll see people there. It's really taught me that you can express yourself and not be fearful about it and really be unapologetic. Because I was always finding faults with myself and finding reasons to be sorry for things I haven't done. And once you learn to let go of that you can really just be you then. The thing I've been so lucky to do and a lot of gay people and drag queens are the same you get to choose your friends and you get to choose your family. I think that's so important as well 'cause I just surrounded myself with creative people from all different aspects and walks of life. [drag] My name is Jack but wigs and duck tape later I am Jacqui Swallows. I am 21, I've been a drag queen for coming up three years. Three years, shit. I was an annoyingly cocky little kid. My sister used to go to ballet classes and I used to sit there in the show and be like, ?I don't think that was very good.? I was probably quite nasty, I would tell her I would do things better than she did. And then my mum said, "All right then." One day and she took me to ballet classes and then I was a ballet dancer for nearly eight years. I went to The Royal Ballet School and then I went on tour for a while. I went on tour with the Royal Ballet Company, that was cool. And so I've always kind of been a bit performy. So I guess drag was kind of my way back into performing. It still baffles me that my parents were shocked when I came out. [Jacqui] No, he's cute to be fair. He's got one of those faces that I'd ride like a stolen bike, ladies and gents. Aggressively and feet first. Jacqui kind of came about because... as an individual I've always been someone who enjoys... laughing and funny and that ridiculously dirty humor. I'm the one that sits on the Piccadilly line and laughs when it says the train's going to Cockfosters. Just because it's funny. So it kind of came about this kind of... this slightly larger than life old dirty mouth kind of Hyacinth Bouquet crossed with Samantha from Sex and the City. Which is kind of terrifying when you think about it but... it seems to work. [drag] Fat queer bearded Muslim... Child of migrants. I am The Nightbus, that's my drag name. I'm a drag queen based in London. I'm a storyteller. Initially they were stories to do with myself, whether it's to do with my identity or my mental health or how I felt about myself in perspective of the environment I was in. As I've gone on over five years it's more to do with telling the stories of other people who don't have an opportunity to tell their story. * Paki, Paki, Paki, Paki, Paki, Paki * [audience cheers] So there are so many things that I can say... in a feminized version of myself that I wouldn't be able to say if I was a boy. And that connects a little bit to also being a boy who is Muslim and brown and often labelled as a terrorist which has happened quite a lot throughout my life. So my voice doesn't matter as much as someone else's because people will dismiss me as being either a danger or a threat, or somebody that they don't want to interact with. However if you're in a feminized version of that they will listen to you. This is where it connects with the idea of misogyny because it's less threatening, because it's a female voice and I hate that idea but the only way that I can sort of embrace it is by championing it. -[soft piano] -[indistinct chat] [Barbs] Today we're going to King's Cross to play some piano. [piano playing classical music]] Classical music is still so inaccessible. In classical music we're still having the conversation about female composers and whether or not women can compose and I think it's disgusting. I mean I don't think classical music is quite-- the classical music scene is quite ready yet for drag, but I think classical music as itself has been quite queer for a long time. But it's not really anything that's addressed much. [piano continues playing] So I don't really know what to expect from today. I remember the last time I played on these pianos I ended up spending like an hour teaching 5-year old how to play ?Mary had a Little Lamb' which was really cute. So that may happen today, who knows. I don't know, hopefully they'll be like ?Ah that's nice? or they might think it's unusual because not every day you see a drag queen in a wedding dress playing piano on Sunday lunchtime. And that's the thing as well, I'm very used to being in the dark or being in a club setting so... And it's nice to show people outside that setting what we do and drag queens aren't just all vulgar people that make jokes and roll around, which is exactly what I do as well but we can do other stuff as well. And also I think it's quite fun because a lot of people don't expect a drag queen to be able to do that sort of things. Even a lot of my friends don't know I play piano, so it's always a nice treat when I can whip it out and show people. So I don't know what people will take from it but I think something positive hopefully. [drag] I always dressed up as a kid I was always very big on dressing up. A really significant moment within my childhood is wanting to be a witch, not like a vampire, and my mother dressing me up as a witch. I was very... just theatrical, a very theatrical kid quite introverted but really theatrical. I was just always felt much more... drawn or tied to the monsters. I thought they were cooler. They, they were more interesting and the costumes are better and I look back now and I know that the women were so much better. The villainous female was just so much cooler than the... the good getters or the heroines at least in my opinion. [Woman] What's your name -I'm Barbs. -[woman] Barbs? Yeah, like Barbara. [giggles] [man] I would think more like Barbarella. Barbarella, yeah that's it. That's why you chose it I assume? I love the name Barbara as well [woman] Do you want some help? I do costumes? -Oh, yes please. -[man] I see what-- I have ruined this dress. Thank you. Thank you. I'm gonna go to the piano if you wanna come see me play. Come see me, in the middle bit. I mean hopefully if there's a little queer out there I think they'd find it great because if I saw someone doing that when I was a bit younger and not out I think it would've been really helpful and quite cute to see as well. Especially as well, doing something like this it's like young people can't go to clubs 16-year olds can't go to clubs, teenagers can't go to clubs. So, often a lot of that culture is missed until you're a lot later and then the whole experience comes around of getting fucked or getting drunk. So it would be quite nice to have people who wouldn't normally see it. or even older generations of people who may really appreciate classical music but who have never really seen a drag queen. I think maybe it would be quite nice for them to experience too. 'cause they don't often get the chance to go to a gay bar every weekend and see drag queens. I think it will be nice a little Sunday treat. [objects ruttling] Okay, I'll do mascara last. [man] You're very beautiful Barbs and I am very much going to enjoy you playing [Barbs] I'm a bit nervous. For what? Why are you nervous? -[Barbs sighs] -[man] Just drama just adding to the drama. It's changed what confidence is for me. It's empowering, it's really beautiful. I have to look inwards for confidence not outward. I don't have to look for other people's confidence which is funny because drag is all about outward and people looking at you, and that's part of the big thing of it. But in fact it was absolutely the opposite. It was drag changing the inside and just the outlook of what I needed to be and what I wanted to be. You grow up being told you're wrong and then you're always going to have those inner clockworks that make you feel bad and mine are particularly nasty. I was just brought up by people who weren't completely ready to be parents or didn't have the best experience themselves of parenthood or childhood. I would never want a child, unless I was in a really good place to have a kid. But I think it's just the culture of that time just to have children. That's just it, if you get pregnant you just have the child. Which I find maddening but I'm a big sissy, you know, so what kid am I going to produce very shortly? When my stepfather came along there was a very big brother little brother relationship kind of I idolized him. He was cool, he had a motorbike, he was like a big brawny guy and my early memories of him are that and then they're two sided with his aggression and like him and my mother violently fighting. This is! I made this from scratch. This is, I had this-- I was listening to the song "Lovefool" by The Cardigans and I was like, "This is such a weird song." She's so obsessed with being this fool for this person. Then I was like, "Oh she's mad. Oh she's absolutely crazy, she's batshit crazy." And so I was like, "What if she's really crazy?" I was like, "What if... Leatherface didn't kill people but did drag instead and then later on killed people?" I wear this kind of like really wholesome '50s dress and I like drop it and then underneath it is this. And then... half way through the number I take-? I have a big dummy behind me and I take it off and it's like my boyfriend's face. One significant moment is that I heard them fighting and I heard a huge smash it sounded like somebody had been thrown into a wall and there was a lot of glass I could hear and I crawled out of my bedroom, which was next door to theirs and I picked up the phone and I called 999 and I didn't really know what to do. So I just put the phone down and then got back into my room. And obviously 999 called back immediately and... my mom picks up and she's like, "No, nothing's wrong." And the next day I was getting ready for school and she said, "You're never to call ever unless one of us has like fallen down the stairs" I think her example was. I remember being really confused because it was obvious that there was something wrong. It was just like, that was normal. That was just what was. Yeah, it was hard when you're in that situation and you feel like you're nothing and you're being told by your carer or at least you're being made to feel like a piece of shit by your carer. And that the other person, who is your mother hasn't got the tools to help you communicate what needs to be. But the end of it was, we had a massive row I was just at the end of it and I packed my car and I went to stay with my real dad, my biological dad. Two weeks later the SWAT team came in and raided the house and... that was when the court case started. [TV anchor] They both denied their guilt to the end. [reporter] You got anything to say Mrs Rogers? Anything to say to the victims? [Woman] They are not guilty. They were running a financial business which essentially was a loan business a finance business and they were loaning out money at very high interests in cash to people often people who were very in need of money very quickly who couldn't pay it back. Basically the violence that we were seeing at home was the same as what they were getting. Though the charges were rape there was... GBH? Grievous bodily harm? Yeah And my mother got dragged into it She was working for him and... she went down for blackmail I think it was. I witnessed some bad stuff he did to people. The way he spoke to people and the things he did. He was a bully. I'm just surrounded by a lot of kind of chaos. I think I'm always tied towards like... the dark or like monsters or just like anything that was different because we were different. They were different, I was different. The reason I'm so interested in... villains and monsters from an early age is perhaps I was trying to understand the kind of unusual characters I was around who might look like villains in some eyes. Ooh, didn't see you there. But it made me who I was. It made me really strong. I don't know many people as strong as I am. I might be an anxious mess. I might be depressed a lot of days but everything I have, I built myself and like where I am today in my career all the wonderful things I've done, I did myself. I did this. And I'm proud of me. [Chai Latte] We have talked about this so many times. [woman on phone] I know. I don't know where I came out of the tube so I got off at Seven Sisters [laughing] Well you got that far [woman] And I got out of the train station and got out into a place that I've never seen before and I don't know how I got there. Okay, all right well we'll see you shortly then yeah? Just knock on the door loudly. [woman sighs] [Matt] So your mum's never seen you in drag before. How are you feeling? Ehm, excited mostly. I know I'm not scared that much because I know she'll accept me for whatever. I feel like it's going to be a weight lifted because it's-- I've always had a bit of a distance between my drag and my mom. I've always kept that little bit of distance but it 's kind of exciting because a lot of my drag and my inspiration comes from my mom so it will be like... where the inspiration came from almost those two things coming together. So yeah, big deal. -[Chai] Hi. -[Alby giggles] I'm gonna cry. [Chai] Why are you gonna cry? [Alby] Look at you. [Chai] Ohhh. -How you feeling? -Yeah, good. You look great! I love your eyes. Can you do my makeup for me? Yes, I can make mamma a drag queen. [giggles] -Ah, you're going to smudge it. -I won't smudge it. [indistinct chatter] [Alby] I just want him to be able to find his niche. -Found it, being a woman. -So, yeah. So long as he's happy and excited and can express himself, in a way? where my baby feels happy then that's what counts, isn't it? Elric grew up watching "Priscilla Queen of the Desert." It's one of my favorite films [laughing] so yeah... [laughs] The inspiration for my drag comes from my mother because growing up seeing her in these massive platform tweeny shoes and big fluffy hats that had like tassels coming down them. Growing up and seeing my mom wearing that and watching her get abused like not physically but verbally from moving cars, in front of her child... So to see her doing that and to still go out the next day wearing an even more ridiculous outfit with bright pink hair or short black and green hair. To see that, that power and that not willing to give in, is what I draw on when I go out. What would mamma do? [Alby] I've been a firm believer of... not letting people put you in a box. So like he says, the more people shout at you the more I used to dye my hair and stuff and... wear my velvet flares and? -[Alby laughs] -I loved it. I forgot those. [Alby] It never affected me when I was being shouted at, I never had it to the extent that Elric says he had it. I always worried about the effect it had on Elric so I was always very conscious not about myself but the fact that people are doing that to me in front of my child and how he viewed or saw that and what he would take away from that. I didn't ever want him ever to growing up feeling that he had to be afraid of what other people were saying. So I just used to say that they were jealous [both laugh] ...because they didn't have the courage to wear what I was wearing. I said they probably looked at it and thought ?That looks really cool but I haven't got the guts to wear it so I'm just gonna shout at her?. So that's what I used to tell him and I hoped that that would help and sink in? -And now I'm a drag queen. -And now you're a drag queen. So it obviously did. Yeah, it did. I always wear football socks with my heels because... ehm... when I started I definitely didn't get paid enough to be spending a whole night in heels without any protection So I would always wear my socks and it makes the world of difference. I try to make everything as easy as possible for me in life and... So I just try and brand myself on being like a shit drag queen [giggles] where I don't really tuck or pad or... wear heels without sports socks and then try to make that my brand so that I can do-- Oh fuck! Look what I just did. I'll just cover it up with some brown. So as well yeah, it's a bit of a homage to my former life. When I was younger, when I was at Uni I used to sell used socks and underwear on Craigslist. I always thought, "there's money to be made and if I don't do it then someone else will and I don't care what they do with my underwear." And also I found it really really interesting being part of someone's most intimate secret and then for like ten minutes when I'd meet them and give them the underwear and then I leave, that's it. That's the only interaction I had with them. I found it really fascinating and I kept a little journal of all the interactions and people I sold underwear to. Taxi drivers, Uber drivers, teachers... I created this guy who was like super masculine called Chuck. So he was like my first ever... drag experience or my first time exploring gender in terms of performance. So people liked football socks or I'd tell people that I'd worn the socks in the gym for ages? which I hadn't. Yeah, that's what seemed to sell more so I was like "Okay, well I'll create this character." And then I became a drag queen. Because being more feminine is more fun than being masculine and the clothes are nicer as well. [Camile] Everyone is a chameleon. You know Camile is just my feminine subconscious that I bring to life when Luke's not always needed but she's given Luke the balls to do what he does as well because when I take this off that was all me you know, that was all me all along. Working as a hairdresser with clients how just giving someone a blow dry can set them up for a whole good day. Obviously your hair is the first accessory you wake up with every day so like being able to give someone the time and the effort to give them that kind of self promotion and look at themselves through that whole time and through this service and go "You know what? I'm gonna make it." Hairdressing grounds me because I can always relate to someone. There's always something that someone's got that is relatable. Doing someone's hair it's not doing the root of their hair problem it's getting to the root of their actual problem. The left frontal cortex holds a lot of emotions It's that why people recede, you know? Is that why people have emotional barriers? It takes a very special skill and that's my superpower at that root problem, at that hair and just make them feel beautiful because they are beautiful, everyone's beautiful. [gentle music] Throughout the past year drag has been a great influence because I didn't do any like dance training or like acting. It's nice to work on the aesthetic and its nice to work on what your face can do. I think it's a good form of escapism. It gets rid of those barriers, barriers that we put up on ourselves that we don't realize we have. Even if we wanna keep the barriers up let's just paint them, or decorate them. My aesthetic is to really feminize who I am as a person to show myself as a flip side, my masculine and feminine. I just put my dial all the way up to max and just go, "This is it." But some people only go to seven or three and that's fine. But I have had, I think, an argument with probably every drag queen on the scene. [indistinct chatter] Drag drama, which is a double D not for me. Margo was telling me the other day that she works very hard from Thursday to Sunday and gets to sleep Monday to Wednesday at least you know until 2pm in the afternoon [Camile] This bitch is-- Shut up! You're ruining my story, bitch. Okay, edit that bit out. And scene. I said some would call that depression but we just call it drag. Oh wait we, you know what? Something's wrong with this community and it's like we want to say that our lives are in the best places. At least we can say we do what we get to do-- Oh she's getting sentimental. We at least get to do what we really wanna do and enhance other people's like emphasis. We just emphasize, we just got the stereo player. Do you know what I mean? That's what's good, that's what isn't good-- I just love wearing no clothes. That's Margo hears walking down the street ?Fuck off Margo.? They hate talent, allergic obviously. Look at them all. You know what drag's taught especially me with Margo? It's that you learn how to build bridges because you love someone just as much as you hate someone-- [laughing] Are you listening to this? No, because it is... it is-- It gets me to relieve some of my sensitivity because I wouldn't have been able to hear that from anyone else's mouth. But I love it because it comes from an angle where I'm striving for every much position that we can just excel with each other. I got lost in that 9-year essay but-- -Ying yang! -...I loved it. Ying Yang, up and down, in and out. Just the way I like it. I'm here to support every single person because every person is unique. * Everybody have fun, Yeah, yeah * A lot of trans women would not like to be called a drag queen would not like to be put into the same category as a drag queen because we're very different but I want to prove that you can be trans and visible trans but also be visibly in drag as well. When I first started to transition I struggled with maybe looking like a drag queen or being confused as a drag queen because they are very different but as much as they're separate they can be intertwined and that's what I like to try and prove. I suppose I came on the scene still struggling with drag because I really wanted to do drag but I still felt that I had transitioned for a reason so why would I do drag? I was a freelance makeup artist at the time and I was bored of giving people the opportunity to be amazing and not giving myself that opportunity. So I assessed the situation. I had met drag queens and I decided to just say "fuck it" and go for it and do it. It was a total escape from my own gender and my own worries about who I am. When I'm in drag I'm really not worried about coming across as a woman I'm just there to have fun and sometimes before I did drag I felt like when I was going out I almost was setting myself a rule book. How I have to sit, how I have to talk how I have to present myself. Just because you are a man you don't have to be masculine, just because you're a woman you don't have to be feminine. You don't, you can do as you please. We are the voices and faces of the LGBT community and I'm proud to say that. [Envy] My drag character or personas will mix and fleet and the kind of Johnny character that has many faces can be any gender, no gender, can be an alien, can be a monster, can be just me wanting to dress up in some women's clothes tonight and act sultry. It's multi-gendered, if non-gendered, if anything that comes up in the future or anything I fancy doing it's all come like organically. Ehm... Sometimes I don't know. Sometimes I'll be a character and I don't know what the gender is. It's just how it feels. I think those would probably be more likely non-gendered. But the more I go on and the better skilled I become in drag the more I find I can do more feminine looks and so there have been more feminine personas or facets of this Johnny persona that comes on when I'm in drag. And I can create a feminine or hyper-feminine face. But I love to make something that's really sexy ugly or something that's really ugly sexy or... really blur. It's kind of like that blurring the lines. [screaming] I don't know how to take this anymore I don't know what to do. Oh my God! And then that's really fun to do and it also in? in a very small sense that might go "Wow that person was sexy, but was also kind of confusing." And maybe that's a lesson for them. [people cheering and applauding] [Camile] It was like when I was a kid all these eyes would look at me and go ?Oh, okay something's different.? When I used to play Tekken as a kid I used to love playing the girl roles. It was like they were amazing because they moved better. You know, the Tekken boys were just like "punch, punch." No, I wanna see some like... hair flips and like dodges, yeah? [Jacqui] It's sad that there's still such a weakness associated with femininity and embracing any form of femininity. We see the divide between gay guys, between... these camp kind of effeminate voguing round G-A-Y late twinks who are feeling their fantasy and the butch kind of gym bunnies that don't want to be associated with that because it infringes on the masculinity they think they need to perform and inhabit to be safe. But I think so much of drag now is... It's almost like a middle finger up at what everybody says you should or shouldn't be. It works, you know, because it's not conforming to a set of rules that people think it should be and that makes people nervous when you can't be put easily in a box. I think the moment I popped out my mom I was never going to be ignored and I would never allow myself to be ignored and school was no exception. I was lucky. Well my school was lucky to have someone like me there 'cause I definitely taught them a good many few things about being a young gay person but then also becoming a young trans person. I was very feminine. I mean I wore makeup since I was 13, I would say. 13, 14, pre-transition I wore makeup. Because I was back then a boy wearing makeup I stuck out like a sore thumb. However there was girls wearing makeup in my class, probably even more makeup than I was but because I was the boy wearing makeup I was the one, "Wipe that off your face now!" I was sent to like the headmaster's office because I was wearing a BB cream once, you know. I was sent off because I wore a little bit of blush turned into bronzer and then I had a full face and that was a huge giant explosion of teachers saying how wrong it was. And I just sort of walked in there and said "I don't have any expectations I just want a long and really big and birthday vibes." And they sat me down and they literally just did them and I was so happy with them. I mean my nails have always been extra but these are really fucking extra, they're really something else. Yeah. -[Matt] Who's birthday was it? -Mine. -[Matt] When? -Wednesday actually. -[Matt] Ah, happy birthday. -Well, yeah. When I had come out as transgender I was no longer allowed to go to the boys but they refused to let me go into the girls toilet. That made it really awkward for me because I could no longer comfortably just do something as simple as go to the toilet. I wouldn't take back all the hardships that I went through at school because they have made me the woman I am today. [Envy] When drag came along and I realized I had this platform to really expand on the ideas of what I do and I'm still doing it today I was able to finally play the villains and play the psychotic individuals or the twisted individuals I've always dreamed of playing. I always idolized in a sense. Being so overtly queer and so overtly what some people might call "wrong" I find really empowering and kind of anarchical and punk. It gives me a platform not only to do performances but kind of like explore anything within me that I might not be able to explore in my day to day with friends or on the street. Just anything that I wanna feel, I can feel in drag. I can draw it up and I can be it. Humans transforming into monsters or into something else. I think that comes through a lot of my-- especially makeup designs I've always had this really strong urge to kind of want to be something else. Well maybe as a kid that's what I felt and through this platform of drag I get to transform into whatever I want to be. I get to transform into something that's strong or better than life or better skilled or had a better shield of armor like any of that. [Nightbus] If there's something disarming about being feminine then that's great. I actually use that to my advantage because my drag can be quite glamourous or quite beautiful and you know I pad and I wear breast plates and you know have dresses made and stuff and people see that and go, "Oh my God, work." And then when I'm like, "Yeah, you know... Trump's putting in a Muslim ban." Or, you know, "32 people were killed this year who were trans across the world and that's just registered in the UK and the US." And I can do that on stage. So you're disarmed by the immediate presentation of something that's very feminine, which people see as being less of a threat anyway and then I think it has more of a real impact to go "This is the form that I am but this is the story I'm going to tell you." [Jacqui] There's something about being a drag queen that almost breaks the ice. There's something humorous about it anyway that kind of adds a bit of a diffuser I guess. There are so many things you can get away with saying as a drag queen. Part of our job is to poke fun at things kind of... maybe add a bit of humor to things that don't necessarily come with humor because what our community, I guess, is founded out of slightly is moving forward to a kind of equality and glum kind of feel. So it's nice to have something that's entertaining and a little bit different that you can make light out of situations. If I'm an asshole to you then it means we're friends. If I'm nice to you, fucking panic. It never ends well or it ends in sex which equally, doesn't end well. [audience laughs] Really it ends up in one of the two of us being disappointed. It's usually you. [Johnny] Okay, this is... my, ehm... Yeah, when I can't store anything on a shelf or on a rail, I shove it in here. So I've got wigs, like, schoolgirl outfit. Oh my God, yeah. Early like... Nineties school, little schoolgirl outfit that I thought was really cute. [laughs] Can't bare to let go and if anyone asks for a schoolgirl number I've got the costume, but no. [Carmen] Erm, it's just like really quintessential drag. It's a leotard so I can add things on top of that but it's just camp as tits, isn't it? It's got asymmetrical sleeves it's taller than I am and then it's leopard print and I'm not a fan of leopard print but there's something about that kind of? trashy? It's a trashy drag look, isn't it? My first ever dress was a wedding dress and I got it for a Halloween costume and was like, "Oh my God, I love it." And I wore it as a house dress for about two months afterwards and my housemates were sick of it. I was just constantly in this fucking wedding dress. It was like a dressing gown I wore it everywhere. Whenever I see a good wedding dress I'm like, "Whoe yeah I've got to have that" until I found this particular dress in Trade and I got it for eight quid or four quid or something ridiculous and it was huge and I had to have it. So I got it and it's been the best thing ever. Although I keep getting booked to wear it and it's really heavy and really awkward to carry around. I'm thinking... It's got lots of ruffles and it's long. And we're looking for? Well a starting point would be red anything red because... that's what the BAFTAs is all about. It's old Hollywood but I think you can tipple a little on old Hollywood as long as it's glam. You can't get more fab than feathers really, can you? A flap... a spin, wooh! Has movement. It's kind of hideous but I love it. [laughs] I mean, come on! I can hardly move, but why would you need to? [laughs] Something like that is all those layers and all that movement. I love chiffon, anything that moves all by itself with little to no effort. [music box tune] I always like the idea of a jilted woman or a woman who's had lots of husbands and has gained all of her wealth from them. I suppose that it's because I used to feel quite jilted in my past so I kind of relate to that. That would be perfect. It's like a little accoutrement to the dress for tonight. I can just imagine how many... how glorious it looked to have all the girls lined up in the same costume and they all look fab. This one belonged to Emily, it's in the boob. Why do one thing, when you can do lots of things? Especially with like style... and taste... like I can be a monster and I can be a full female bodied woman or as some might say a suspiciously large woman. [indistinct] [music box tune] Yeah. Unfortunately not. [tailor] I think I can pull a few more for you. Yeah, honestly, you're the expert here. I'm just the drag queen with the big eyes. [laughs] [tailor] Step into. [music box tune playing] [music box tune continues] [Matt] Do you do a lot of drag queen costumes? To be honest I have to say a lot of drag queens can't afford the price Yeah, it's not the most well paid industry. Which is why "Everybody is talking about Jamie" and RuPul is brilliant because they're now kind of getting more money into the industry, you know. Well, actually this would fit. [tailor] Let me have one more scower. Yeah, of course. Give this a go or is that too red? [tailor] If you saw the lady that this was made for you'd never know this would go on you honestly. [Envy giggles] Full of surprises! Oh that's perfect! -We do have to tuck, just so-- -[tailor] Yeah. [Envy] ...we don't have our little friend... Amazing! [tailor] That's it, that's your dress for the night. Yes. [lively music] [Matt] Filming with Shaz. [Nightbus] Fuck off, fuck off. Oh my God, you look so good! -[Envy] We're having a bath! -[Nightbus] Why? [Envy] We're having a bath at the BAFTAs. [Nightbus] Margo doesn't bathe. -[Bimini indistinctly] -Disco He's not listening, don't care. God you look fab. [Bimini] We've got the break now. [Nightbus] Until when? [Margo] What are you talking about? -[Bimini] I'm not in the bath. [Envy] Hiyaa. [Nightbus] Hiyaa. [all laugh] Full disclosure. Margo is just like * Only the crumbliest flakiest chocolate. * [Bimini] They are melting. You're all ridiculous. Where are you? I'm getting a cab. [Bimini] Tonight I'm performing a Tina Turner number "Private Dancer". Actually when I was younger I used to hate it because it was something that my parents would play and it wasn't cool, but I loved the song so much. So tonight I'm doing it at The Glory. It's actually the first place that I ever performed pole and it was actually the first place I ever performed and they're so great at giving drag queens an opportunity and a chance to get on stage and show their art, show their creativity so yeah, I'm looking forward to it. Disco, come on! I mean when you first interviewed me a year ago I'd only been doing it for about six months but I'd focused more on performing and started doing pole and kind of been taking that. And elevating and trying to evolve my drag as well. Kind of figuring out Bimini as a drag queen and as a character. When you first interviewed me I was kind of going through a bit of a rut social anxieties and kind of depression. I was teaching yoga and I had to stop teaching because I was going through a lot of mental health issues myself. To start with it was fine, it was just what everyone was doing. I'd moved to London and it was exciting. We were taking drugs. So I would take a lot of G, GHB, crystal meth, mephedrone, and just party for days and days and just keep going. You just get wrapped up in it, caught up in it and so many people do. So many gay people and queer people do. You grow up not accepting yourself and then you find acceptance in these people and people are doing these things and you think it's normal and then it's fun, but it's not fun when you're on day five and you haven't slept and then it's becoming a regular thing. I remember going to sleep and waking up every hour shaking because my body needed it, my body craved it. If I hadn't got out of it when I did and deal with the consequences which came after, yeah I would probably be dead. Come on. I witnessed people overdosing regularly. I used to go under all the time and I never took it as a big deal. I remember people were put off by seeing it and it never did for me, it just didn't. I just became... so used to being in the situation and relying on it in social situations to just kind of perk me up. And when I did decide to stop, my social anxiety was just completely awful. I used to walk in a room and think people were talking about me that people hated me. Now I don't care if people do hate me like whatever or people talking about me, but then it was such a big thing. With drag, when I first moved to London at 18, I started going out in Soho and I met drag queens in person for probably the first time and I remember thinking "I'd love to do it." And I did a form of drag but it wasn't anything I took seriously. When I first got back I think I was back for about a year before I was like, "No, this is what I wanna do and this is what I'm gonna do." Then that's when I started performing. [Jacqui] We're in my home town. We're on the Isle of Wight which is bizarre considering that, you know, I grew up here. I wouldn't say the Isle of Wight was stuck for a little while but I think we're now starting to see things move forwards on the Isle of Wight like accepting a big old seven foot man in a wig like me. Can you imagine a gay club in Camp Hill? It would be amazing So what kind of kick started Isle of Wight Pride was a local MP for the Isle of Wight saying something incredibly homophobic and disgusting and yeah, kind of pride came around in a response to that. It's nice that, as the only gay kid growing up in the village when I was growing up here, it's now nice that there's a huge celebration every year and that dogs come to my show. It's a rowdy crowd of 12 tonight, isn't it? Good Lord. I'm gonna draw this out. It kills five minutes of my hour showtime. Ladies and gentlemen! I just popped a bollock. Please welcome to the stage... Miss... Jacqui Swallooowwws! Turn it back up, dear! [audience cheers and applauds] [Jacqui] I think this kind of show is very new to the Isle of Wight, you know. It's different, isn't it? Different parts of the country, and well the world. They catch onto things at different times. I suppose after a drag race craze, or after any place where they are used to drag they have expectations, they've seen it before whereas on the Isle of Wight everyone thinks I'm great because they haven't seen any better. But no, they're great fun and they're always up for a laugh. It's nice. I have a bit of pride that it's nice to see my hometown going "Yeah, this is really cool and we want more of it." [Nightbus track plays] * Paki, Paki, Paki, terrorist, terrorist Paki... * [screams and cheering] [Nightbus] Yeah, so I've had abuse in drag on the streets from cars passing by but I also know that I'm quite ignorant to a lot of it because actually even in drag, although it's quite a feminine form like I do still look quite manly with a beard so I probably get away with a lot more. Also because I'm brown, people are a little bit... skeptical of coming and saying something to me which is quite interesting. I've had some abuse from Asian people in cars and it's been about things like, "Allah will punish you" and I'm just like... "We're not getting into this right now" because we could definitely have this conversation for days." And then I've had some really horrendous things said to me in Berlin when I lived there for a year. People asking me how... what proportion of the N word I am, which has been quite... sort of, "Did you just say that?" and trying to understand what that means. So the abuse has mainly come from being... brown and then there's an element of being queer in there as well. [Matt] And how do you deal with abuse when you get it? [sighs] I don't really rest on it. I think it's about looking at the wider picture where that comes from and where it stems from and why people say that. It's only when someone will outwardly say something and I feel comfortable enough to shout at them because what's the worst they can do. Even if you kill me that will be on TV and people will know about that and you will never be the same again so you can't do that. You're the one who's always gonna come worse off. I don't really shy away from having arguments but I don't like them. I'd rather have a conversation. But actually, to be honest, I find it exhausting, I find it exhausting trying to explain these things to people. I don' t need to sit there and tell you every day why I'm not a terrorist or why Muslims are not all bad or why queer people aren't disgusting. * Paki, Paki, Paki * [Barbs] Oh yeah, we got mugged. [Camile] We nearly got stabbed. -[laughs] -That was in view. That was well funny, we turned-- We used our drag to advantage because it actually scared them off. Yeah. We were rolling a jazz cigarette down the canal in Haggerston... These two people came up and was just like ?Give us your phone and money" and we were ?No, not giving that? and I had fifty quid cash in my pocket as well just did a gig at The Glory, so I was like, ?No, you're not having that.? And then he got this seven inch hunting knife out and it was like, "Eugh!" especially when you start seeing a lot more queer performance like things don't shock you as much and when he got this seven inch hunting knife out he's not gonna hack us apart with that. "No, still not giving you my phone and money" and then they didn't know what to do at that point. -Yeah. -The other one grabbed me and punched me in the face. And then we got up and he, the other one just threw me back. He'd opened me up and was like, ?Right.? All the prosthetic boobs came out, the fishnet leggings, the thong, he was like, "Oh my God, what's going on?" Now it's like bulge, bulge, bulge, bulge. [laughter] And then he tried to get on to Carmen and Carmen has this massive suitcase. -She was like "No". -He tried to grab her suitcase. It had makeup in it. Carmen, she's like 6.2 foot, gorgeous, just like picked up her suitcase full of make up and was like, ?Fuck off!? All her possessions. -And just pelted it. -Then all of a sudden they just started to run and we were like "You better run." -Yeah it was-- -Would you say that was a homophobic attack? Oh no, it was more of a mugging but they shat themselves when they saw us. [Bimini] I was in Ley Fest, it was down in Kent and there was a guy, I think he was coked up or he was on something and he was just like "What the fuck is that?" I was in a bikini, I looked great and he was like, "What the fuck is that?" He was all riled up and his friends were laughing and saying "just leave it" and it was, "Why am I ruining your festival? You're at a festival, just enjoy yourself. Don't see the drag queen and be like, "'what the fuck is that?' just because you fancy me?" It says more about them. It's like, "Okay then you have got a problem." You're meant to be at a festival to have fun. What's it about? That's all it does when people give homophobic abuse it's just like, "Look at yourself babes." And then genders very black and white and very well blue and pink I guess. Like you are told from a young age what you should do this is wrong, this is wrong, so when you do see someone playing with the boundaries I think it shocks a lot of people and intimidates people as much as they probably wouldn't like to admit that they feel intimidated by it. Our job is to then determine okay how do we seed that, where is that coming from? And I guess I do that outside of my job in the hair side of things as well like you see it every day people don't actually know who they're looking at when they see themselves. It freaks people out a bit but I think that's even more reason to do it to be honest. Every time I see someone getting attacked for homophobia it makes me feel... In a way it's a form of activism It's like I am here, I am doing this and you need to get used to it, kind of thing. I'm not going to stop doing drag because of it, if anything I'm going to put more lashes on, more blusher on every single time someone looks at me funny. I went to school where we were forced to pray to God every morning and it's like I'm not religious so you know, why is it that all of a sudden a child is exposed to drag and it's a bad thing? What is bad is teaching your children attitudes where you don't accept people a lot of the thing I've got out of doing drag is how lovely drag queens are to each other as well. Of course you have the bitchiness as well but in general we are a family, we are a family. I would much rather teach children the value of finding friends and family and exploring yourselves rather than teaching them to hate people and be ignorant. Of course, I don't think there's been one drag queen that's not had abuse whether that be traveling to the gig or going home from the gig or in the club itself. I think you've got to be doing something right for people to have a go at you and I've always believed in that. They might be across the road and shout at you but you walk straight up to them and they nothing to say to your face because they never do. Because they have nothing to justify themselves with. There could be a group of like what? Five young boys? But still five of them and I'll walk straight up to them and be like, ?What?? And then they go all quiet and they're like ?Oh well I didn't say it, he said it. Oh no he said it.? It doesn't matter which one of you said it, it was one of you, it was all of you probably, but now that I'm in front of you, you don't want to say anything, do you? You don't want to be put in that position you don't want the confrontation. I suppose when I'm in drag I'm more sort of like "Yeah, I am. I am a faggot, I am a tranny, I am this, I am that, because I'm in drag and those are my words and I'm not going to give you that power. The moment you say you are the words they're shouting you at you've taken, you've snatched that power away from them and you've snatched the opportunity for them to poke at you and to make that situation. Just don't whimper and don't panic. Because if you show them the weakness then they'll want it more and it's a drug to people like that and they want more and more and they'd want to see you get more uncomfortable and I'd just say, "Put your headphones in sit there like the bad bitch you know you are and just ride it out." A funny story, I was walking back home to Whitechapel, walking down one of the side streets I'm in half drag, I've taken a bit of my drag off I'm in boy clothes and... I've got my headphones in and I'm probably listening to some musical or some sissy, sissy something and I'm having a little jolly because I'm a little bit drunk and a car pulls up to me and I can hear something shouted behind me but I keep walking because that often happens or someone is shouting at someone in the street. And the car pulls up to me and I realize that they've been shouting at me and I pull my headphone down just to catch "What the fuck are you, you fucking faggot?" And, I am like... [funny voice] "Cool dude, yeah you caught me I'm a faggot, whatever." And he reaches down for something and I, you know, I tense because I'm ready for something to be thrown at me and he throws and it hits here and it's a chocolate cake. And it splats, it misses me and splats against the... the shutters next to me and I go, I'm just like aghast I was like... "You threw a chocolate cake and you missed?" And then it gets worse. He looks at me and then he's like... He reaches down again and throws another chocolate cake and misses again, and I'm like "You throw like a girl, you big faggot!" Obviously I don't believe in those things but, you know, I wanna twist his nipple I wanna twist his titty at this point. And his, I'm like, "You wasted your chocolate cake"? And he's just so angry with himself and is in such a spat that he drives off and speeds off into the night and I'm like [applauds] "Thank you for that, that really perked up my night? and then I turn around, look back and there's two splats of cake slowly slipping down like, you know, his sense of worth. [laughs loudly] Fucking idiot, what a waste of cake. [laughs] I've been abused I've been physically assaulted five times since March twice in one night. In nightclubs, outside of nightclubs getting into Ubers. I've had people spit on me, but I've faced them down every time and I win and I carry on and I get brighter and louder and er? if? [sniffs] if I stop doing it they win basically. That can't happen, that's not acceptable, that's not an option. So we just had a great night at Cirque Le Soir. It was such a good night, it was such a high. Everyone was getting along and then, I said goodbye to everyone I got on the bus I went up to the top, back, that's where I always sit, my favourite seat and as soon as I sat down there were three girls who started shouting so I put my music in, blocked them out just ignore them, hope it goes away... and it didn't. They started throwing stuff at me they poured Coca Cola on my hair threw chips at me. [attacker] Film me and see how that goes. Oh my days! It was the words that hurt it wasn't just being assaulted because I've got thick skin, I can take it. It was the words that they used. [Chai] Back the fuck off! [attacker 2] Are you fuck-- Pervert, pedophile... -[attacker 1] Chill, chill. -[attacker 2] Delete that. "You're a disgrace, abomination." [indistinct insults] You know horrendous, horrible, unthinkable... things and for them to see me on the same level for being positive and for expressing myself that was the one that shook me most. [applause] "Forty five pairs of eyes but not one statement from a witness all the footage is out of date because they acted too late so tell me how do I forgive this?" Well I've been bruised you know I've bled, that was the worst. As anyone does when they're attacking another human being they don't see beyond that, you know, that's someone's child they're attacking and that's the other aspect. Someone's brother, sister... They just see a target -and that's not what they are. - No. I would never not stand up for myself or my friends or my community and I feel, especially if you want to be a drag queen, that's what the essence of it, it's the core, standing up and defying odds and boxes and breaking down walls. So for me to run and hide would be to me defeat the purpose of a drag queen. So I stand my ground and then... I phone my mum... and cry. Because I'm just so tired of having to fight all the time to be accepted. There's relief when I know he's physically safe but I fear each time the phone goes. I didn't know. I should have brought a tissue. [both laugh] -You've got sleeves. -No, I haven't. I fear each time the phone goes that it's something worse. People say to me about having my son living in London we've got family in America and their fear is terrorist attacks and that's not something I ever worry about generally because my reality is the day to day fear that my son is going to be abused or beaten for who he is, not for hurting people, but for expressing himself in a manner that makes him happy and I fear every time the phone goes. But I don't want him to stop. [both laugh] I don't want him to stop because I don't think he should stop being who he is for anyone. Because that just makes the world a smaller and a sadder and darker place. Drag is definitely a protest. Ehm, it's a protest, it's subversive, it is... [sighs] I mean it feels so... trite to just say ?sticking it to the man? but it really is. It's a disruption that I think even in a microcosm like London we just take it for granted that people are liberal and understanding but actually... the people living in London are from so many different backgrounds where they haven't been exposed to even the slightest bit of queerness for them to even see a drag queen especially a brown bearded one who's fat and takes up space. I think that is a huge disruption for me. I do sort of toy with the idea of if I do want to perform for straight audiences. if I want to be doing something that's so mainstream because one thing that other people who are drag queens or work within queer circles would say is that actually sometimes it can feel like you're preaching to the converted. If you're queer and you're talking about queer issues to queer people then what are you ultimately doing? Yeah you might be queer but if you're white there is an element of privilege in that and I'm going to point that out. And that in itself is a protest, I think. Saying ?No, this is what your normal is this isn't the norm of everyone." Yeah, I would say it's a protest both in queer circles and outside in the mainstream. People walk away from my performances with their minds changed about something because actually that's the primary purpose I make something to make people change their minds about it. And at the same time it can be a desperate existence just doing this day in day out and thinking what is the fucking overall purpose of this? What am I actually trying to do? Am I just doing this because I want to be famous? Shockingly I don't really enjoy drag in the same way that I get a thrill from doing it all the time. I enjoy being able to be subversive with it. [Bimini] Yeah I think in the last year I've definitely evolved a lot. Grown to understand myself a lot more. I'll always carry that addictive personality but now I try to become addicted to things that I enjoy like yoga or pole dancing, or fitness and I become obsessive with it. For my drive and what I want to do and my ambition and my creativity it's done wonders for it. Disco, come on! Good boy. This year something just changed and I' ve really worked my ass off this summer performing... Done many festivals, done cruise ships and it's been amazing, and I'm so blessed to be booked and I'm blessed to be doing something that I really enjoy doing. So pole dancing is something that I've really always loved because it's always been... kind of soaked in this femininity. Dancers and sensual women, and... strong women as well, like you've got to be strong and you've got to really work at it to be able to build yourself up on the pole. I've always aspired to it. With yoga it helped, they kind of go together, even though they're polar opposites in what people would expect they really do compliment each other. I mean you don't often see people performing pole anywhere. I like bringing something a bit different to my performance. [dance music] [audience cheering] I don't feel the urge to do the things I used to do. I feel a lot stronger, I can say no. Yeah I can't ever see myself going down that path I think I've worked too hard to get to where I am now for me to slip back into my old ways. [disco music playing] It went really well. The first time I've performed it so it's gonna be my new number, I really had fun and I think everyone else enjoyed it as well which is always good to get good feedback. But it was very impromptu like no introduction just like walk on the stage and everyone's like everyone's looking, yeah, it was good. [disco music] [audience cheering] [music continues playing] The power of makeup. Then a little bit of brown. Oh yeah look, gone. [piano playing] For me being in school was never a place I could be queer. So for me to now be visibly femme and being in nurseries and schools is quite nice. I went to a really posh conservatoire and hated it. It was amazing and the education was amazing but it was just such an alien world for me. I love classical music but I'm from a working class family and like it's very, I was always the odd one out because I like classical music and it was really weird and I wanna make it more accessible and basically I just want all of the communities I've experienced and met through being part of the queer community and artists I've worked with drag queens, performers, poets, strippers, I want to include everyone within the medium of classical music. So it all kind of stems from that idea of taking things out of perspective and putting it into a place it wouldn't normally be seen. The classism and elitism and ableism around classical music. Ehm, I was getting frustrated so I started going to the cabaret scene out on the cabaret scene and I was seeing things like in pub basements that were blowing me away just made with cardboard and tinsel but the performance and the passion and the emotion behind it all was so overwhelming so I want to broaden the audience accessibility of classical music. It's so exclusive. So yeah I just want to try and change that somehow in my own little way and give people the opportunity to work in classical music, because I love it, and I want to share that as well. Please go mad for my very good friends one of the reasons that I'm here on the Isle of Wight so often. They're wonderful, they're talented if not slightly sagging from the waist down. Ladies and gentlemen, please go mad for the Camp Hill Coooookies! So this evening, some of my good friends from the Isle of Wight a group called the Camp Hill Cookies and they're burlesque chair dancers and they're probably the campest women I've ever met. They're ladies who-- Some of them have never performed in their life and they come and they do these classes, and some of it is about exercise and weight loss and all kinds. But they perform and they're absolutely amazing. You know if you'd have said ?Oh well there's a drag queen performing on Monday night? people would go ?No.? And if you told them there was a group of 15, 20 middle aged women performing burlesque routines in a social club next to a disused prison to have fun make friends, lose weight, you'd say exactly the same thing but it's amazing, they're so talented and it's lovely to see and I resonate with it I guess that look of pure joy of just having fun doing it and just thinking balls to everything else. [piano plays classical music] [applause] [Barbs] Oh, thank you. [man] Absolutely wonderful ma'am. [Barbs] Thank you very much. -I'll do another one. -[man] Oh, thank you very much. Ruining the illusion. [Matt] I thought it was all your normal hair. Oh really? I wish. -[Matt] It's getting there -It's getting there [Lucas] I was going to say the colors almost match. I know! I'm so lucky, because that's a really cheap wig as well. Yeah, it's like £8.99 each. I'm very low maintenance. -[Matt] Shit drag. -[giggles] Yeah, shit drag. -[Matt] Do you want me to undo it? -Yeah. [Barbs] I think it is... There we go, ta-da. [Jacqui sings out of tune] I should have been a singer. [woman sings more out of tune] You shouldn't of. There's nothing more than I love than a sing along up here. [woman] Can I just have a look at your makeup? You can, I've taken my eyelashes off. -[woman] Unfortunately. -I'm very sweaty. [woman] You look so gorgeous. [woman] Oh my God. [Jacqui] This has become some sort of weird family self help group. I'm certainly not being paid enough for this. [laughs loudly] I got grandsons in their thirties and yes, they talk to me just like that and I talk to them back just like that. [laughs] He uses all the swear words I do and... all the filth. I reckon he's gorgeous. I'm 76 and if I was younger I would go for it. [laughs loudly] We are the superfans. I'll give you my address so you can do the injunction when you need to. [all laugh] -She's not joking. -I'm not, I'm so not. He's probably the only one on the island that we've seen, ever. But it's amazing because we've got quite a closed community on the island so it's something different. The island is a bit reserved and the island needs Jack. [Matt] Do you still live with Tommy and Dan? No, I don't live with Tommy and Dan anymore. So many big personalities in a house. It was beautiful, we had all these ideas. Tommy taught me so much about discipline. While I was living there I just felt... "This is a really good opportunity." There's so many people that... have so many things around them that we can build on. But it wasn't really teaming. It was just like, you had a gig, this had a gig, Tommy had a gig, Dan had a gig and we couldn't live in a house together as well and not become family. Come on darling, come on Barbs, get that down. And that's where I learned, where my family weren't so supportive of the drag. They always have my back in some sort of sense. Whereas the drag family at 66 didn't always have my back but they were supportive of my drag and I had to balance that out between two families and it wasn't like Luke was in one place and Camile was in the other. Every time I go back home it's a little bit more warmer. Me, my sister... and my two nieces. It's like my sister doesn't want them to see anything that I do like that. I need to come as an educator if I'm going to do anything because when the kids grow up they're going to go to school with it, that, this, she, him. I don' t want them to feel like they're like I was very sheltered and very shelled, because it takes years and I think it's going to take a few more years until I can completely come out because its not just coming out as a gay sexual, bisexual or whatever I am masculine, feminine, trans, you know, "it", like this. If I can do it round them if I can be who I am around them then I can be myself around anyone. I would cry, it would overwhelm me so much. That's where I get to in my dreams if something makes me feel that much it means I want it that bad. It's just the fact that I want to be able to sing and be able to not be scared of this. This is the worst thing I fear and I have to get through it. If I don't get through it I'm not going to find that peace that I was looking for. -[soft music] -[car engine revs] [Chai] So we are at Byline Festival which is a poetry, literature and music festival. I've been partying doing drag, because I stopped drag for a little bit before the last interview due to the abuse I was receiving and it sort of gave me a refuel after doing this a year ago. Since then I've hosted at Homehouse which is the fashion house ball which I did for New Years Eve, and then Amsterdam and then we've done performances together as well spoken word which I've done in drag so yeah, this will be my first drag performance. -I think I've grown a lot. -[Alby] Yeah. I think you've become a lot more confident and I think you've learned a lot about yourself through drag. Who you are and the persona you want to present to the world and how you wish other people to perceive you. There will always be people who don't have the same opinions or perceptions, and that's okay for people to have that. It's when they attack your child multiple times. That doesn't leave you. [presenter] She is the most wonderful star sometimes called Chai Latte, sometimes called Skinny Latte, sometimes just Latte with Cream. [Chai] Bricking it mate. Oh my god, I'm shitting it. But I 'm also just so excited. This will be the first time I've rapped the poems. It's a pro-drag queen, pro-femme. It's about being different and not accepting the responsibility of other people's thoughts and views in their small mindedness. [soft music] [rapping] * Desert sands over London * * Cast a crimson sky * * I saw a mother pointing * * Covering her daughter's eyes * * I walked right by in my rose gold satin thigh * * Highs they, They said it was a sign... * [Chai] Fucking exhilarating and nerve wrecking and emotional. I can't describe the feeling you know, it was great. To be able to get to that stage of your life where you can get up on stage in front of people and perform your own work it's been like a five year journey that's culminated now and I can't describe how proud I am of myself. It's great. You've got to remember is gender is learned and what we're doing is un-learning it breaking it down. Making it what we want it to be and not what somebody tells us it should be If you're masculine you've got to be angry or if a woman's angry it's seen very differently It's in everything, marketing, advertising, it's male and female, it's split up so it's just getting rid of that. [Barbs] I often have people thinking-- mistaking me for being trans or something and it's like, "No, this is all a performance this is all a character" but it also allows me to go out of the house and explore my gender fluidity a bit more. It's a really great way to build confidence. You know it takes a lot of guts to go outside in drag in day time. I think it's very important to be visible. [Camile] A lot of people wear masks all day they work their 9-5, they don't come out of that mask. Even though you don't change people change around you because they have to adjust to what they see [Bimini] Putting on a wig and a heel you feel invincible. As ridiculous as it sounds but it's more like a mask [Camile] You go into it thinking that the fear comes from you, but the fear is coming from them. [Barbs] And it does have a benefit especially for 15, 16, 17, 18 year olds who grow up in small town and are not exposed to this. Especially to being queer which is different to being gay so you know I think it's really important in that kind of setting. I have a lot of hope for the generations below us. I think there's so much happening now already. [Camile] They're going to be like our X-men. [Barbs] Brilliant, so they're going to pave the way for the generations after them, It will always be changing and developing so I think in that sense it will always be relevant. We're all odd. That's what makes us all even. [giggles] Yeah, yeah.
