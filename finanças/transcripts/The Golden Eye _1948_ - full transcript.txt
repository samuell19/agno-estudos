WONG: Oh, Mr. Manning. - Much pleased to see you. - Hello, Wong. - How are you? - Good. Much wishes for the Happy New Year. That's right. This is the 12th of February. Chinese New Year. All wishes for happiness in the coming year. Have just received a very fine shipment of beautiful thing from the Orient. Nothing picked over yet. No, Wong, I'm not here to buy anything for the ranch. I came to see you because you're the only friend... ...I have in San Francisco. Wong much honored. There's trouble in Arizona, Wong. So? At the Golden Eye Mine? Not only at the mine, at home, on the ranch, everywhere. Someone is trying to kill me, Wong. You have told a policeman? No, Wong, this is no matter for the police. Either they won't believe or won't understand. This is a case for Charlie Chan, if I can find him. I'll gladly help. Chan at present time at Chan family on Washington Street... ...where he bring New Year's greeting to honorable cousin. Fine. Out in Arizona, they never figure that a Chinese might be a detective. - Where's your phone? - Right there. Miss Manning, please, 604. Hello? Yes, Dad. I have traced down Charlie Chan. I want you to go get him. He's at the Chan family society on Washington Street. Do you want me to bring him to the hotel? No, bring him here. I have been followed every minute since I entered Chinatown. All right. Goodbye, Dad. Tell the rest of the story to Wong. I fear someone very busy person. Yes. You stay here, I get you some tea. Oh, Mr. Manning, what happened? You hurt? No, Wong, but I've had another escape. Look there. - Oh. - And there. Let's get out of here until Chan comes. German Mannlicher bullet. Many of these guns now available in country... ...since recent unpleasantness with Mr. Hitler. As though they carved the nose of it. Yes, even so would have been end of you... ...except for bullet being deflected by window glass. How soon can you start for Arizona, Mr. Chan? Oh, well, that, uh, poses a little question... ...because my arrival in Arizona would give warning to enemies. But you must come as soon as you can. Someone is trying to kill Dad and I feel I'm in danger too. Bad sign for a New Year. - You know, Charlie, I have an idea. - Yes. The Lazy Y Dude Ranch is only a half mile from my property. You could arrive as a guest on a holiday, still be right at scene of action. Dude ranch? Heh. Well, that idea certainly appeal... ...to number two son, Tommy and Birmingham. BIRMINGHAM: [SINGING] Home, home on the range Where the dear and the antelope play Never is heard an encouraging word And the cloud stays cloudy all day Ha! A born cowboy, that's me. Two-gun Birmingham rides again. [GRUNTS THEN CHUCKLES] Hmm, what am I talking about? [HUMMING] [LAUGHS] Yeah, this gonna be a fine trip. [HUMMING] Well, now, where's...? Oh, now, wait a minute here. What's the matter with this thing? I know I had it right. Packing this baby every year. That's better. No, here, let's get along. Wait a minute. This old cowhide looks like it's got some live cowhide in it. Hi, Birmingham, how do I look? Tommy. Man, you're sharp. You gone. You mad. Hey... ...how do I look? I'll let Pop tell you that. I can't wait till I hit those wide-open spaces... ...the range, the little doggies, hit that trail, hit the leather. Wait a minute, you come over and help me hit this leather. Having trouble? - I think you got too much stuff in it. - No, the suitcase is too little. - There. - Yeah. Wait a minute now. Wait-- I did that before, you know, and it popped right up in my face. Well, that did it. Oh, you got stuff sticking out. We'll have to open it up. No, don't do that. We'll never be able to close this again. Wait, I'll fix that. Less trouble that I have around here. Hold it up there. Turn it up, I'm gonna fix it. [BIRMINGHAM CHUCKLES] We ain't going through all that trouble. I bet you this will do it. Mm. Ha! That will do it. Now lay it down. Easy, easy. Easy now. Hold it now. Ooh. Phew. Ha! That did it. Good-- What is the matter with this--? What is the matter? You can't do this to me. You just can't do it. I ain't gonna let.... [CHATTERING] WOMAN: Oh, my God. [WATER SPLASHES] [SLURRING] I wish the scenery would stand still so I can see some of it. Oops. Mr. O'Brien, you've been drinking. Oh, somebody must have told you. Old gossips. That's my business. - Have you any other kind of business? - No, that's none of your business. Oh, say, that's a pretty good one, ain't it? Yes, sir. Yes, sir--Yes, sir. I must be drinking vodka. I'm getting a Russian accent. Ha-ha-ha. Water. [O'BRIEN GRUNTS] Hello, pal. - How about having a drink on me? - Thanks, I already have one. My name is O' Brien. Vincent O'Brien from San Francisco. I'm down here trying to straighten up a little bit. Uh-huh. My name is Driscoll. Driscoll? I heard of that name. Oh, yes. You're the superintendent of that mine. That is-- That-- The Golden Eagle? No, that's-- The Nickel Plate. - No, the Diamond Horseshoe. - The Golden Eye. Oh, yes, the Golden Eye. Yes. - Driscoll, huh? - Mm-hm. Uh, Birmingham, please to take luggage to bungalow number nine... - ...and arrange accommodation for self. - Yes, sir. Where are you going? Well, uh, earnestly desire to have period of quiet contemplation by swimming pool. I'm gonna have a period of quiet contemplation by the pool myself later. Yes, well, uh, personal reasons for contemplation... ...differ from those of number two son. Heh, heh. Mining, that must be a very interesting business. Must be. You know, my father-- My father was a miner. Oh, he was a miner, way back in, uh.... Oh, no. No, I guess it was my grandfather who was the miner. Yeah, must be my grandfather. Excuse me, see, I got to see a book about a girl. Now, don't go away, I'll be-- I'll be right back. Hello, honey. What's you reading? - A book. - No. See, you know, it's very bad, a tree like this with a pretty eyes like you. Why don't you go over there where the sun shine and read the book? It's nice over there. Thanks, I think that's just what I'll do. Oh, now, wait a minute, honey. Please, I-- Oh, don't go away mad. Nice girl. [IN NORMAL VOICE] Hello, Charlie. Well, Lieutenant Mike... ...at first, question reliability of own eyesight. Vincent O'Brien, San Francisco playboy... ...slowly but surely reaching the ragged edges of delirium tremens. Uh-huh. Then, uh, working on case? Yeah. On leave from the force of the government. And I'm playing this thing for all its worth. I see. At first, think, uh, Lieutenant Mike giving prohibition party kick in teeth. Hello, Mr. O'Brien. [SLURRING] Well, hello, honey. Aren't you going in the water? Water? Oh, that's for codfish. [BOTH LAUGH] Goodbye, honey. Have a nice time now. Have a nice time. [IN NORMAL VOICE] Down here on something? Yes. Am, uh, endeavoring to unravel small desert mystery. - Yeah? CHAN: Mr. Manning, head of Golden Eye Mine. Manning, huh? You know, Charlie, I think we're barking up the same tree. I'm scraping up an acquaintance with Driscoll over there... ...superintendent of the mine. Where are you located? In, uh, bungalow number nine. Fine. I'll stagger over to see you after dark. [SLURRING] Well, that's my friend over-- Don't go away now, I'm coming right over. Oh, boy, that was a close-- Did you see that? I almost went in-- [LAUGHING] [GROANS] Cold. Cold here. DRISCOLL: Come on. Give me your hand. - Come on. RUARK: It's wet. Did you see who pushed me? I was minding my own business and then somebody pushed me. Come on, sit down. Yeah. It's a fine thing... ...out for enjoyment, everything's.... You must have seen him. He was stand-- [SINGING] Oh, bury me not on the lone prairie Where the coyotes wail And the wind blows free And when I die you can b- Come in, please. Hello, Lieutenant Mike. [IN NORMAL VOICE] Hello, Charlie. Well, Lieutenant Mike... ...you know, uh, I think you are overplaying your part of drinking man. In fact, I think might say, you go overboard. [BOTH CHUCKLE] I see what you mean. I have mouthful of news for you, Charlie. - Your man, Manning-- - Has had accident. Yeah, how did you guess it? Well, Mr. Manning have series of accidents... ...including two days ago in San Francisco... ...when bullet come through window of curio shop. - They nearly got him this time. - What happened? Fell down one of the shafts. Bruised head and shoulders, possible skull fracture. Oh, you have much news, Lieutenant Mike. The doctor from El Dorado stopped to have his car gassed... ...on the way to the ranch. I overheard him talking to the attendant. I see. Well, I think I better go there at once. - Tommy. - Yes, Pop? People who listen at keyholes rarely hear good of themselves. I knew we weren't up here on a holiday, Pop. Yes. Please tell Birmingham bring car around at once. Okay, Pop. Hello, Lieutenant Ruark. Hey, hey, young man, watch your language. Cut out that lieutenant. I'm Vincent O'Brien down here. Oh, boy, is this interesting. [RUARK CHUCKLES] Well, so much for so much. Uh, but, Lieutenant Mike, you have not yet told me why you are here. Well, we're not as interested in Manning as we are in the Golden Eye Mine. After many years of low returns, it suddenly turns out... ...to be one of the biggest and richest mines. I see. Well, uh, any news of discovery of new vein or lode? No, that's just it. And there's been no publicity on it. But the way the gold is floating... ...it's a bonanza and it's just too good to be true. Well, very strange coincidence permits itself luxury of occurring. Mine suddenly become worth very much. Owner's life become worth nothing. Heh. Well, I must go to ranch. You come with me? - No, I better stay undercover for the present. - Uh-huh. I got some of Driscoll's fingerprints off his glass. I wanna send to San Francisco for identification. Oh, good. Small things sometimes tell very large stories. - Goodbye, Lieutenant Mike. - Goodbye. Will not be long. Yes, sir. There's something phony, Jim. - I don't understand it. - Neither do I. Man's been down that shaft a thousand times-- [KNOCK ON DOOR] - Yes? - Am Chan, dealer in Oriental curios. Meet Mr. Manning in San Francisco... ...and have brought for him some objects of jade for his approval. - Uh-huh. Come in. - Thank you so much. My name is Driscoll. I'm the manager of Mr. Manning's mine. Meet my wife, Mrs. Driscoll, Mr. Chan. How do you do, Mr. Chan? - Very charmed indeed. - Mr. Bartlett, the local assayer. BARTLETT: How do you do, Mr. Chan? - Mr. Bartlett. Jim, I think I better be running along. - Tell Evelyn good night for me. - Okay. - Good night. - Good night. Mr. Chan. Mr. Manning can't see you just now. I'll be glad to give you a receipt for that jade. Oh, very sorry, but, uh, must deliver jade to Mr. Manning personally. That's impossible. He's had a serious accident. Oh, very unfortunate. Uh, perhaps other member of family present? Just a minute. Sit down. Well, thank you. Evelyn. - Yes? - There's a man out here, a Chinese. Says he got some jade for your father. All right. MRS. DRISCOLL: It's not so big compared to others here. CHAN: Oh, so? This is Mr. Manning's daughter, Evelyn. Oh, uh, greatly charmed. Regret immeasurably to hear of unfortunate accident to parent. Thank you. You, uh, have something for my father? Yes. Uh, your father very old friend of Chan. Many of these objects come from valued collection in San Francisco. - I've heard him mention your name. - Oh. If you like, I can take the jade. I'll see that he gets it. Very sorry, but, uh, promise Mr. Manning to deliver jade to him personally. - But that's impossible. - Well, also impossible... ...to give jade into other hands. But he's unconscious. He has been ever since his fall. Yes. Very strange accident. Uh, could possibly see father? Well, I guess it will be all right. - Come. - Yes. [WHISPERS] Quiet. [IN NORMAL VOICE] Dr. Groves... ...this is Mr. Chan, an old friend of Father's. - How do you do, sir? - How do you do, doctor? - Injuries are very serious? - Quite. Multiple contusions about the head and shoulders. It's impossible to tell just how bad without x-rays. CHAN: I see. Uh, have, uh, any idea how far Mr. Manning fall? - Oh, about 40 feet. - Forty feet. Anybody have any idea of cause of fall? DRISCOLL: None at all. There are iron rungs running down the side of the shaft. Mr. Manning has been up and down a thousand times. Oh, well, uh, perhaps a case of, uh, too much familiarity... - ...breed carelessness. - I suppose so. Well, I must be going. I've written full instructions and left medicine. I'll send a nurse out as soon as I get to town. That won't be necessary. I arranged for a nursing sister. Good. Nurses are at a premium nowadays. Mr. Manning will have to have opiates for days... ...as he recovers consciousness. I've done all I can for him at the present. Uh, doctor, will accompany you to car. Talbot had to go. He told me to say goodbye. You know, I'm going to have to rely on the two of you until Dad's better. You can depend on both of us. Thanks. CHAN: Well, young Mr. Bartlett... ...assayer of precious metals. Yes. And when did Charlie Chan, the detective, become Mr. Chan, dealer in Oriental art? [CHUCKLES] Oh, so? You remember Bartlett, uh, collector of customs in Honolulu? Oh, yes. Also remember young Mr. Bartlett... ...excellent first baseman who play with number one son on high-school team. What are you doing down here, Charlie? Are you after gold or after Mr. Manning? Well, young man seem to be very full of important information. Not much information, but an awful lot of suspicions. Are you after Manning? No. Chan, uh, not after Manning. Mr. Manning come after Chan. Very much afraid some enemy may be threatening life of same. - Oh, yes? - Yes. Possibility that fall down shaft of mine not accident... - ...but deliberate attempt at murder. - Hmm. Mr. Manning have several accidents... ...including someone shoot at him in San Francisco. You know, there's something strange going on at that mine. They're shipping an enormous amount of gold lately. Yes. Uh, appears as though Mr. Manning well on way to be large millionaire. - Exactly. - Yes, very interesting circumstance. Yesterday an old prospector came in, not a very honest or reliable one... ...with some gold ore for me to assay. I know enough of the geological formations in this part of the country... ...to know that ore came from the Golden Eye Mine. - Oh? You can be sure? - Yes. He confessed that he'd hijacked it from an old disused mine shaft... ...running from a trapdoor beneath his shack. I guess there was a lot of hijacking in the old days. And, uh, now? The mine hasn't been worth anything the past few years. But there are rumors that she's really paying off now. Uh-huh. Uh, what, uh, your assay show? I haven't finished it yet. I'll know more about it tomorrow. Possibly will pay you visit at that time. Fine. Well, I've got to be going along now. I thought some of that information might be of value to you. Oh, yes. Uh, information, heh, heh, very high-grade ore. - Goodbye, Charlie. - Goodbye, Mr. Bartlett. Hello there. Well, hello, Evelyn. - Drop over to have lunch with me? - At the Canton Cafe? Yeah, Ptomaine Louie's. [BOTH LAUGH] How's your father? Just the same. He's still unconscious. - The nursing sister get there yet? - Oh, yes, she arrived almost immediately. She's a weird character. You can hardly get a word out of her. Talbot, has it ever occurred to you there might be something peculiar... ...about the series of accidents Dad has had the past few weeks? So you've been struck by that too? Has someone else wondered about it? - Yes. Charlie Chan. - Chan? You mean, Chan, the Chinese curio dealer? No, Charlie Chan, the great detective. Oh, compliment very refreshing. Oh, hello, Charlie. - Come on in. - Well, thank you so much. - Of course, you met Miss Manning. - Yes. Had extreme pleasure. Honored father much better, I trust? No, he isn't. Oh, so sorry. Regret exceedingly was not present... ...when, uh, last unfortunate mishap occur. Yes. It'll be a miracle if he recovers. Yes, true. Uh, but in any case, Miss Evelyn be very wealthy young woman. Wealthy? What do you mean? Rumor say that mine now producing large quantities of gold... - ...in past few months. - That's ridiculous. My father would've told me if that had been the case. The mine hasn't paid expenses for the past few years. Well, uh, desert present many mysteries. EVELYN: That's ridiculous. Oh, didn't know you had company. I'll come back later. Wait a minute, Pete. What do you wanna see me about? Make an assay on that last ore I brought in? Yeah, it's nothing. It won't run more than $6 to the ton. That's impossible. That's supposed to be pretty high-grade stuff. Now, look, Pete, I know where you got that ore. Now, why don't you, uh, make a clean breast of it? How about Miss Manning over there? Anything I learn here will go no further. Uh, pardon, please. You gain entrance to mine... - ...through trapdoor in your shack? - Maybe. How do you know, stranger? Well, uh, small investigation sometimes brings large amount of knowledge. This, uh, ore is from new lode recently uncovered in mine? Hey, you're pretty sharp. That ore comes from the only new vein they've opened up in the past three years. Yes. And so far has proved to be most unprofitable. So Bartlett says. I don't figure it. Where is the gold coming from? So you've heard about that too, huh? Well, there's been whispers. So it's common knowledge now that the mine is a heavy producer. Well, some of the boys used to be, uh, pretty interested in the Golden Eye. Uh, have keen desire to gain access to mine through secret tunnel tonight. Well, I guess that can be arranged. My shack is at the bottom of Hay Canyon. But what's in it for me? You're lucky I don't turn you in for hijacking gold ore. Yes. Will be at your shack shortly after dark. Oh, all right. Please do let me know as soon as father able to talk. - Yes, I'll do that. - Thank you so much. I go now. TOMMY: What do you think you're gonna find? CHAN: Do not know. Many needles in this haystack. Seem nobody home. Well... ...strange. Prospector supposed to meet us here not here. We go on with investigation without permission. Tommy, light light, please. Now please remove rug. Will find trapdoor underneath. Gee, Pop, you're right. - You surprised? - Well, I-- Please open. This ain't my idea of evening entertainment. CHAN: Shh. Come, this way. All right, you go this way. I go that way. We meet back here. Mr. Chan, if you have to be a little late getting back... ...and don't see me, don't worry, because I'll be way ahead of you. - Come on, Birmingham. - Don't rush me now. Don't rush me. You're always rushing somebody. - Spooky, isn't it? - Shh. Don't say that word. - I mean, anything can happen down here. - Uh-oh. - Everything's done happened. - What do you mean? Look at that. There's shoes. Wherever there's shoes, there's feet. And wherever there's feet, there's legs. And wherever there's legs, there's a body. Sure looks like it. Gee, I wonder if he's dead. I don't know. Don't care. It'll always remain a mystery to me. - We gotta find out. - You don't have to be curious, do you? - Okay, you go and get Pop. - Yeah, I'll get Pop. Wait, you better come and go with me. - No, I gotta stay and watch him. - What for? He ain't going nowhere. - Okay, you stay, I'll get Pop. - Wait, no, you won't. You stay, I stay. - I've never been so undecided in all my life. - Make up your mind, do something. Do something? Don't tempt me, boy. You'll be left here alone. - We'll go together. - Go together. Wait a minute now. I'm going with you. TOMMY: Don't push, Birmingham. - Don't push you? Don't talk to me, consult my feet. It sure is dark in here. Don't tell me it's dark and you're scared too. Look at that light shaking. - That's your hand on my arm. - Oh. - I wonder where Pop is. - I don't know. He went there. - Mr. Chan. Mr. Chan. - He'll never hear that. Hey, Pop! [ECHOING] Mm. Somebody is in this tunnel. - Come on, let's go this way. - Just an echo. What does he got to do with it? Ain't nobody talking to him. Mr. Chan! Mr. Chan! [ECHOING] Uh-oh. Echo again. What's the man--? What is he trying to do, get me excited or something like that? - What is it? - Go away, echo. Oh, Mr. Chan. We found something, Pop. A dead man. - Yes? What the dead man look like? - Dead. Marvelous piece deduction. You show me. Uh, Mr. Chan, you all go ahead, I think I'll stay here. Ahem. What am I doing here alone? Wait a minute for me. - Here it is, Pop. - Yes. - Remove dirt from face. - Huh? You heard what your father said. It's an old man. Yes. It's old prospector... ...who was supposed to guide us through mine. - Murder, Pop? - Maybe. Possibly not killed here, but body brought here to be found. But why? Little knowledge sometimes very dangerous thing. Oh, Mr. Chan, you want us to move the corpse--? Mm. Why do I say the foolish things? Yes, willingness to speak not necessarily mean willingness to act. No, we leave body as we find... ...then not too many questions asked why we are here. As mentioned before, little knowledge sometimes very dangerous possession. Come. We go. Hey, Pop, somebody frisked the joint. Well, yes. [CHUCKLES] Looks like they're wise to us, Pop. Uh, correction, rather imagine intruder was looking for non-existent jade. Ha, ha. You know, good jade, uh, worth much money today. You straighten up please. [BOTH CHUCKLE] - Hello, Lieutenant Mike. - Hi, Charlie. What did you find out at the mine? Oh. Find dead body of prospector who was supposed to show us through. - Murdered? - Possibly. Imagine he was possessor of very dangerous information. And, you know, think very likely Charlie Chan might find self... ...in same unenviable situation. Yeah, I'm practically in the same boat with you. Oh, no. Wealthy San Francisco playboy on spree... ...much better disguise than Chinese curio dealer. Say, they really gave you a going-over, didn't they? - Yes. - Certainly did. Charlie, I'm gonna take a gander at that mine the first chance I get. Yes, uh, intend to make second investigation myself. Possibly tomorrow night. I'll go with you. Two heads are better than one. Well, uh, sometimes debatable point. Heh. However, will welcome assistance, which has been very valuable in past. [KNOCK ON DOOR] Oh, excuse me. - Oh, hello, Mr. Bartlett. - Hello, Charlie. Oh, uh, Mr. O'Brien, a guest here at ranch... ...and number two son, Tommy. [SLURRING] Pleased to meet you. Mr. Chan, I want you to pardon the intrusion. But at night, all the numbers look alike, every one of them. But I wanna say one thing... ...you got an interesting collection of jade. Very interesting. Very-- Excuse me, please. Pleased to meet you. [CHUCKLES] Come in, please. Number two son about to make self scarce. Oh, gee whiz. [CHAN CHUCKLES] Sit down, please. Well, Charlie, did you meet the old prospector, Pete, as you'd arranged? No, was not in cabin. Yes. There's a mighty good reason for that. His body was found trapped under a fall in the mine a few hours ago. Yes, uh, body was also discovered by Chan and associates. Oh, you were in the mine? Yes, but, uh, not make very much progress because fall of timber and ore... ...which suffocate prospector, also effectively block tunnel of mine. Why didn't you report finding the body? Well, thought perhaps presence of Charlie Chan and associates there hard to explain. By the way, Charlie, uh, just who are your associates? Oh, number two son, Tommy and chauffeur, Birmingham. BARTLETT: Ha, ha. - Yes. Uh, however, intend to make second investigation of mine as soon as possible. Tomorrow night? Possibly. Well, I got to be going, Charlie. Let me know what happens... - ...and if I can be of any more help, huh? - Yes. Thank you so much. But the whole thing is so puzzling, Talbot. Father should have regained consciousness by now. Skull fractures are like that, Evelyn. In fact, it's a good sign, if anything. It means perfect immobility and quiet. But I'm sure I heard conversation in that room this afternoon. Father must have been conscious. Well, why didn't you go and investigate? I did. Sister Teresa insisted that no one had been talking... ...that Father was still in a coma, and he certainly seemed to be. That Sister Teresa certainly is a peculiar person. You can't find out anything from her... ...whether Father is better or worse, whether the situation is dangerous or what. Have you told Charlie Chan about this? No, I haven't. Why don't you call him up and have him come over here? After all, you know, he was hired by your father to find out what this is all about. Yes. Yes, I think I will. That's gin. Again? Boy, you is the luckiest lad I ever did see. Hey, wait a minute. I didn't see you pull that king. [PHONE RINGS] Hello. Mr. Charlie Chan's bungalow. Mr. Charlie Chan, the great Chinese de-- Dealers in curio, jade, ivory and what-you-call-them masters. I'd like to speak to Mr. Chan, please. BIRMINGHAM [OVER PHONE]: Mr. Chan is not in. Oh. Would you tell him Miss Manning called and I'd like to see him as soon as possible? I'm sorry he ain't here, but I'll see that he gets the message. Yes, ma'am. There's a lady with a ranch who wants to see Mr. Chan pronto. Don't you mess with them cards because I'll be right back. [IN NORMAL VOICE] Somebody was watching your bungalow when I left this evening. And I have a hunch it was Driscoll. A-ha. Well, maybe so. Somebody seem to have great interest in activities of Charlie Chan. Yeah. Oh, yes. I received a telegram from San Francisco a little while ago. - Driscoll has a criminal record. - Good, good. Now we start to make progress. [KNOCK ON DOOR] RUARK: Come in. - Uh, Mr. Chan. - Yes. Lady at the ranch says she wants to see you right away. Oh, good. Thank you, Birmingham. Please get car. - Will be with you immediately. - Yes, sir. Well, more events may be taking place. By the way, expedition plan to mine tunnel tonight must be postponed. - Will see you later. - Okay, Charlie. Sit down and relax, honey, or we'll have to be getting a nurse for you. [KNOCK ON DOOR] - Come in, Mr. Chan. - Thank you. Mr. Chan, I just felt that I had to send for you. Oh, very much complimented. - Hello, Mr. Chan. - Mr. Bartlett. I can tell you what's bothering me in a sentence, Mr. Chan. My father is supposed to be still unconscious... ...yet I'm certain that I heard a conversation in that room this afternoon. Well, uh, perhaps, uh, guest in house? There's been no one here. Well, let us seize upon fact. Father unconscious, yet can talk. It looks that way. Perhaps you'd like to pay a visit to the sickroom. Oh, most admirable suggestion. All right. This way. Mr. Chan would like to take a look at Father, Sister Teresa. His condition is unchanged. Perceive, however, you have changed bandages? That was considered necessary. The doctor was afraid of germs. The interior of the mine was probably alive with them. Oh, yes, of course. Possibly you were anticipating tetanus. Tetanus? Yes, tetanus. Lockjaw. Oh, of course, lockjaw. - We have been afraid it might develop. - Yes. Uh, what doctor's opinion of continued state of coma? There's nothing to be done. - I report to him twice daily by telephone. CHAN: Hmm. Uh... ...perceive you have been injecting opiates into Mr. Manning. Why? If Mr. Manning should regain consciousness... ...he might become very violent because of terrific pain. Oh, so sorry. Oh, please pardon clumsiness. Very fortunately bottle not break. Thank you so much. Well, Charlie, what do you think? Well, much mystery here. Many questions only receive answer when Mr. Manning regain consciousness. - If that ever happens. - Yes. But I have feeling everything now running toward logical conclusion. But, uh, must go now. Much to be done. BARTLETT: Goodbye, Charlie. You know, he just doesn't seem to be getting anywhere. Don't be impatient, Evelyn. Chan never shows his hand till all the chips are on the center of the table. MAN: Hurry up. There's the shipment. Pedro, help me carry this box. [SPEAKING IN SPANISH] Hey, Pop, I got a message for you from the lieutenant. - Yes? - He spotted Driscoll in the bar. Then a man from the mine came in... ...said something to Driscoll and the two left in a hurry. Uh-huh. What the message? Lieutenant went up to do a little investigating. - He go alone? - Yeah. Oh, not good. Uh, Birmingham, we go to prospector shack at bottom of canyon at once. Yes, sir. That's all there is. Let's go. [CART BANGING] [CHUCKLES] What's the idea, bud? What are you doing down here? Oh, I thought I'd like to look the mine over. I guess I got lost. - Got lost, eh? - Yeah. - Well, get going. - Uh-huh. Copper, eh? "Lieutenant Ruark." I just conked a guy that was trailing you in the mine, a copper. - What? - Yes, San Francisco police. A Lieutenant Ruark. Come on, let's get this stuff loaded fast. On your way and don't stop for anybody. Now let's get in the mine and get that copper. He's heading for Pete's shack. Go around and head him off. We'll stay here and bottle up this end. [GUNSHOT] Come on. He's gone in the shack. Boys will take care of him. Look. [GUNFIRE] Lieutenant Mike. Guns. [GUNFIRE] - Don't give me no gun. - Take it. Okay, okay. CHAN: We go get behind them. [GUNFIRE] [GUNFIRE] - Lieutenant Mike, you all right? - It's nothing. I think I have the answer to my problem. Yes, sir. To me, it seems like, uh.... [RUARK MOANS] We must get Lieutenant Mike to doctor at once. - Quick, Birmingham. - Yes, sir. - Well, did you get them? - Woods and canyon were full of guns. We were lucky to get back alive. Sooner we get out and head for parts unknown, the better. Wait. We've got quite a slice coming to us in this operation. They're gonna close in on us, I'm in favor of letting the money go. [CAR ENGINE REVS] Who's that? [CAR DOOR CLOSES] - What's happened now? - Plenty. We caught a San Francisco copper in the mine. The boys had him holed up in the prospector's shack. Bushes became alive with guns. - Was he a federal man? - No, detective lieutenant. - Others? - We didn't have time to see. - Bullets were popping around us. - It's about time we get out of this joint. You can't go till second shipment comes in tomorrow. When that's gone, go as fast and as far as you like. What about our dough? You'll get it tomorrow night, and that's final. If that Chinese comes snooping around the mine... ...put a bullet into him. Ask questions afterwards. He's got no right on company property. CHAN: Well, uh, situation getting much more simple. Gold worth $7 ounce in Mexico... ...worth $35 ounce in United States. Case one very simply of smuggling. Gold is brought in from Mexico... ...delivered to mine office on United States' side... ...as product of Golden Eye. Oh, how did that explain the attempts on Manning's life? Well, uh, not know for sure... ...but whoever in charge must be very important person... ...certainly want Mr. Manning out of way. I've got a hunch it's Driscoll, the mine superintendent. Yes, uh, could be. Certainly Driscoll would have to know about operations. Yet he very tried and trusted friend of Mr. Manning. Yeah. Say, what about that nursing sister? Oh, have known for a long time that nursing sister absolute imposter. Oh, then you checked? Oh, yes, full staff of nurses in attendance, no Sister Teresa ever heard of... ...and incidentally, Mr. Driscoll never call nursing home for aid. - Well, all we have to do is move in on them. - No, no, much too soon. Too many questions must be answered before puzzling case are solved. Yeah, I guess you're right. I got in touch with Captain Gonzales of the Mexican border patrol. Good. He's gonna post men on the Mexican side. Find out how they're getting into the mine. CHAN: Uh-huh. Well, only wish, uh, Charlie Chan case as easily solved. Oh, cheer up, Charlie. The solution of one case may lead to the other. Yes, possible. But, uh, incidentally, think it very good idea if you go immediately to local police... ...and establish your true identity... ...because time very rapidly approaching where aid may be necessary. Say, I think you're right. - I'll do that right away. - Good. Lieutenant Mike, perhaps would be better you stay in car and cover means of retreat. I think you're right. I wouldn't be of much use with this bandaged flipper of mine. Right. - Let me go down first. - I ain't arguing with you. Why number two son so anxious to lead? I don't like the looks of this door. It might be a trap. - They might be waiting for us to appear. - Well, deer should not toy with tiger. But if number two son feel valorous, shall not deny him. Okay, Pop. The last couple of days, I've been under the ground more than a groundhog. Come. Not too much noise. Now, this, uh, where we separate. - Uh, Mr. Chan, did I hear you say separate? - Yes. - You take tunnel to right. - Okay, Pop. I go straight ahead. Birmingham, take tunnel to left. Uh, Mr. Chan, can we have time to argue that point? No, we cannot. We must cover all tunnels as quickly as possible. I'm very pressing because case now rapidly reaching conclusion. If you see something, call out. Call out? Whatever happened to yelling and screaming? Please commence. - Yes, I'll do it but my heart ain't in it. - Tommy. What am I doing down here? Why didn't I stay at home? Yeah, I'm all alone down here and Mr. Chan and them all gone and-- Good gracious, what am I doing in here? Mm-mm-mm. Oh, boy, a railroad track. Hope there ain't no train coming because if it do, it's gonna be a tight squeeze. Uh-oh, I done found another one. Mr. Chan. Mr. Chan. Mr. Chan. Mr. Chan. Mr. Chan. Mr. Chan. [ECHOING] Mr. Chan. Mr. Chan. Mr. Chan. This place is crowded. Let me out of here. Mr. Chan. Mr. Chan. Mr. Chan. Tommy. Good gracious, somebody, come here. Mr. Chan. Where's everybody? Where's somebody? - What's the matter? - I wanna see your father. Where's--? Stop it. You shout loud enough to wake sleeping dead. Mr. Chan, I just seen it. - You saw what? - A body over there. Draped down, pajamas all wrapped up... ...and ready to be delivered. Pajamas wrapped up? - Yes, all the way up to the eyes. - Good. You show us. Oh, yes, sir, I'll show you. Tommy, go ahead and show him. You got a better light than I have. Go ahead now. Come on, I'll show you. They're going down the south shaft. Let's cut across and keep an eye on them. There he is, right in there, Mr. Chan. Right in that cart. There's no time for foolish play. Where is body? Well, it's right in there. Uh-oh. Well, it was in there. You sure you saw it? Mr. Chan, when it comes to corpse, I do not make a mistake. Strange. Dead man cannot walk. Well, we can run. Come on, let's go. You know, I believe that dead man probably Mr. Manning. - The man who had the accident? - Yes. It necessary we immediately go to Manning ranch. There's way out this way. Well, that's the best thing that I can do is get out. Well, he was there. The cart, let's fill it up and push it down. Kick out that stop. Hey, Pop, look, there's a truck loose. - Let's go. - Move. Mr. Chan, you're talking about a shave, that's the closest shave I ever did have. - You said it, Birmingham. - Get Lieutenant Mike... ...and then go immediately to Manning ranch. Case rapidly approaching climax when attempt life of Charlie Chan. - And associates. - Yes. Come. Yes, sir. Wait a minute, Lieutenant Mike. Think it better if Charlie Chan go in alone to avoid suspicion. Will give signal if necessary. Okay, Charlie. I hope Pop isn't walking into anything. Don't worry, Tommy. Your father will be all right. Why put your head into a lion's mouth? EVELYN: Oh, come in, Mr. Chan. - Thank you. Any new developments? Yes. Have just come from mine. - Your father is-- - Yes, Dad's still unconscious. Pardon please. You say father still unconscious? I was just in there a moment ago. Oh, I know there isn't much you can do as long as he's in this coma... ...but is there no answer to this mystery? Possibly more progress made than can be imagined. Patience our best plan in matters of this kind. - I suppose so. - Yes. Uh, have very keen desire to see father. - Of course. - Thank you. [PHONE RINGING] - Just a moment. - Yes. Hello. Yes. Sister Teresa. Hold the phone, please. - Excuse me. - Yes. Sister. Sister. - You're wanted on the telephone. - Thank you. - Hello. - Please do keep eye on Sister. Yes, this is Sister Teresa talking. That Chinaman was in the mine tonight. They tell me he found it. What? I told you to be careful if something like-- Yes. I'm so sorry to hear that. [WOMAN SCREAMING] Get away from him. [WOMAN GASPS] Well, look like Mr. Manning suddenly get very long hair. TERESA: Stand back. [GUNSHOT] - That did it. - Uh-oh. Here we go again. [WOMAN GRUNTING] Come on, get up out of there. CHAN: Well, thank you, Lieutenant Mike. Arrive in nick of time as usual. Mrs. Driscoll. Yes, Mrs. Driscoll. Well, now can safely say... ...that proof of identity throws dazzling light on entire mystery. But what happened to Father? Where is he? I'm very sorry to have to inform... ...that honored father, Mr. Manning, no longer alive. Was found by diligent chauffeur of Chan in mine tunnel early this evening. But body spirited away by gang. Then Mrs. Driscoll impressed into impersonation... ...to make plot reach successful conclusion. Then Driscoll is our man. He's the head of the whole gang. [PHONE RINGING] Oh, Tommy, will you please answer telephone? I'm expecting important message. Hello. Okay, Captain Gonzales, that's fine. I'll tell him. Well, ladies, afraid masquerade party over. Sorry. RUARK: I better go out and round up Driscoll. CHAN: Yes, do so. DRISCOLL: Drop that gun. No, Lieutenant Mike. Drop it. Very clever, Mr. Chan. All right, Margaret and Jini, let's get out of here. Put them up. Thanks. Good work, number two son. Get over there. Go on. Captain Gonzales called. They grabbed the last shipment of gold at the mine. Good. And all evildoers now repose in arms of Mexican Border Patrol? - Yeah. - You're not gonna pin all this on me, Chan. Ugh! Where's that gun? I'll get that-- Here. [GUNSHOT] - See Driscoll? - Yeah. I shot him while he was trying to make his getaway. Well, that takes care of him. What happened to Mr. Driscoll? RUARK: Bartlett shot him while he was trying to escape. Tommy. [SPEAKS IN CHINESE] [SPEAKS IN CHINESE] RUARK: Well, that's that, Charlie. Looks like we wound up another case. Driscoll was at the bottom of the whole thing. Uh, contradiction, please. Sorry to disagree, but this are not so. Real murderer and brains of whole gang, our young Mr. Bartlett. Talbot. Yes. Mr. Bartlett only one in possession of real identity... ...of Charlie Chan from beginning. Very eager to help Charlie Chan. Also very eager to lead activities up wrong channels at all times. Mr. Bartlett number one suspect from very first. Also possess a very ambitious plan to wed Miss Manning... ...and thus gain control of whole Golden Eye Mine... ...after unfortunate accident to father. But that can't be true, Mr. Chan. Unfortunately, yes. Mr. Bartlett also murderer of aged prospector and partner Driscoll... ...whom he shoot in back. Ain't that something? Ain't that something? Good gracious of me. That's Mr. Chan all over. When you think it is, it ain't. And when you think it ain't, that's just when it is. [LAUGHING] [English - US -SDH]
