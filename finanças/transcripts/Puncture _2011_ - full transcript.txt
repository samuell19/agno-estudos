Mom! David took my hairbrush. David, give your sister brush back! Its alright. I got it One minute! Bye. Thank you, Mom. Quit it. You know the keyboard with type writes are like to crying... - 'Slow. Keep it down.' - Oh, yeah? Here we go! Dammit. Hold him still! My bad, sorry I'm trying. - Shit, shit, shit. - What? It got stuck. Oh, I got this. - What happen? - She got stuck. based on a true story - I don't give a fuck of that bitch. - She freaked out? Yeah. Is there anything more bored than patterns on hotel room? I know. Why they can't just use solid colors? Easier to hide the stains. That's so right. We gotta get the fuck off the stain. Who you waiting for? Hello, Mike. Can you turn off that goddamn music? Yeah, for most part, yeah. Yeah, I guess you can say that. So it's bullshit they fired a guy because of falsifying his resume... It because he exposed the work orders. It's a little late to change your tactic, isn't it? It's all warp out on the repairs. But it didn't matter because they never gonna do the repairs to begin with. Hey, lad, shut the fuck up! - Hey! - Mike, where are you? Just hanging out with some friends. You know what? You get some sleep, I got this, okay? - Hey! - Bye. Hi. - You still sleeping? - Yes. So you try to tell the juror the reason my client was fired... Was because his falsify his resume. Not because he went bob your head... And reported the trucks not getting fixed, and people are dying as result. Correct? Say yes. - Yes. - Now, you also already said... That you won't even re-review my client resume... After he went to the media, correct? - Yeah. - On, May 9th... Trucks went to the house Alex Foreman for the broken water pump. That's result on Mr. Foreman burning to death... On June 17th... Another house went to the house Crystal Dorgan... Also with the non-working pump also ending with Ms. Dorgan burning... - To death. - Is that true? - It is. - Not shit? - Damn. - He knew sent non-working fire trucks on the house on fire? - He says he didn't. - But you just say the trucks were broken... Because the work orders were deleted. Work order could be anything. It could be broken ladder... It could be tire alignment. It could be a tear on the fire suit fabric. But it wasn't a tear on the fucking suit fabric. The damn pumps won't work, right? So if the work orders were being deleted... And you didn't know the trucks need to be fix... They were never gonna be repair to begin with, were they? So... I'm sorry, after you realize the paper works system... For the work orders were so screw up... That you accidentally approved 2 fire trucks that didn't actually have... Working water pumps. Realizing this, by the way, because my client... Expose the fire department bureaucratic mess to the public. After you realize this, you felt... The best suggestive of your time... Would not be go back and fix the system... In an effort to prevent the death of more innocent people... You thought the first thing you should do... What looking for my client job application and resume... Even though he already been working for the department... For 4 years. - That maybe what it looks like... - I'm sorry, sir. To simple question, which is you look into first? The work order system that just cause death 2 innocent people? Or 4 year old job application of an employee... That just publicly humiliated you? And I remind you, sir, that you're under oath. I guess the application was first. No further question, Your Honor. You serious? In fact is... Fantastic. Come on, Mike. You should take this seriously. Then you should really have a drink, counselor. - We were celebrating. - I don't mind. Should I remind you that we won? Oh, damn. We won't stay long. 5 minutes, okay? - Let's get this. - Oh, no, thanks. - Have you seen my husband? - No. - You look great. - Thank you. - How's your baby? - Good. - Growing? Please tell me you're joking. No. He really hasn't change since 8th grade, has he? No, he hasn't. Do you see my fucking husband? I think he might be out back. Can we go now? You can't keep your case on class, the student have been complaining. Alright. We all here. For Christ's sake. Can you relax? No more talk about work. Everybody, no more talk about work! - This is a party. - Interesting party too, Mike. Hey, what's going on? - What the fuck is that? - It's an alligator. Hey, listen, guys. I can't keep having my front gave you work. - It's gonna take you twice long... - Twice long to find the... 1994 case King's County Vs. Stevenson? Which protects the right of people with disability... You used keep that best. Including animals use for emotional support cases like... Regardless on the landlord policy... Make the vision of your clients... Illegal. Ended up in the value of really nice settlement. You welcome. Thank you. You guys gonna see that nurse tomorrow, right? Alright. Alright. I gotta go. What you mean you gotta go? You just got here. I can't stay, man. My wife's probably in the crowd... Right now and your lizard were try to bite her foot. Don't go, man. You just got here. I got a waste of premises to find. I want you to say it now. - Is he serious? - It will be great conversation. Jamie, what the fuck? Are you nuts? There are people upstairs. They could've... In our bed, in our fucking bed?! You asshole! Jamie, we should talk about this. But this is not the way. Apologize. Apologize! I'm sorry. I want a divorce. I'll see her. Alright, everyone. Drama's over. Fuck. Why are you still have this piece of crap? I love this car. Okay, drive. That drink taste like one of your ass. Good for the body, good for the soul. All that soda? It's gonna destroy you. So you get your gun back? Not yet. You alright? She'll be back soon. So, after I got myself a bit. I decided to fight. Oh, thank you, sweetie. AIDS isn't a death sentence anymore. And the medicine gets better and better, every year. - Are you sure? Yes, of course. - This is all we had. - Leave it on glass. - That's okay. We're fine. Thank you, David. Of course, honey. Anyway, the day are set. If anybody could help, it will be you fellas. My friend Jeffry invented this after my accident. It is a safety needle. Can't break yourself. Can't be re-use. Safety needle like this, could prevent incidents like mine from ever happening. And hospital refuses to even look at it. Excuse me, so you were... Injured on the job, but you're receiving workers compensation? Yes, they kept up with end of it. Unfortunately I don't think there's anything that could be done. That's, all flaw are provides for and... This is really are all we can get you. But I don't want anything else. No personally, anyway. You see, my cases are not isolated incident. This type of thing is happening to frontline help care professionals. - All the time. - We're very sorry. We have to make them use this. The bottom line, is... The hospital are knowing putting their employee at risk. Letting them get hurt. People are dying. And then again I feel this tap. How often that needles really happen? Do you think it's like a daily things? Don't matter. It isn't a case anyway. Cause if we think the hospital negligence... Our clients could be every hospital work along the country. Mike, we can't afford on you on fishing expedition right now. I think we should go meet that guy. The guy who invented the safety needle. If you come with me to meet the invented guy, I'll give you 3 extremely focus... 3 extremely focus, 8 hours / day. Interviewing as many lines accident victims... Trying to squish their insurance company for an extra $12... - As you want. - Really? Deal. Give me that claim. Jeffrey Dancort. - That's me. - Paul Danziger. We're the lawyers from Danziger and Weiss. He a lawyer too? This is Mike Weiss for you. I was working as mechanical instructor engineer... When Vicky got stuck. So you guys met her? Yeah, we do. It's a terrible shame. We've been best friend since kid. That's really hit me. I spent a year working on... Developing the concept. And no one ever use it? St. Anthony's Memorial Hospital used it for 2 years. - How's that working out? - Not a single needle stick accident in 2 years. So there's no way you can get stuck with this thing? Can't get stuck with it. Can't re-use it. Doctors love it. Nurses were begging for it. Only St. Anthony's Memorial would buy it. Why? I hope you guys can tell me that. Okay, as start you should call 200 hospital in the next couple of weeks. Then let us know exactly what their response... - 200 hospital? - I know it sound like a lot, Mr. Dancort... But what we gonna do here, we need data... I already calls 2.000 hospital. What they say when you show them the needle? They asked me to leave. Is there any way we can sue a hospital for not... Buying something that saves people's life? He's good. He's very good. Can I talk to Karen Brown? Sure, no problem. Talk. On the phone you were aware of the high number of accidental needle sticks. How about 800.000 a year. - Is that an accurate number? - You don't believe me? No, it's not I don't believe you. I just... I wanna know it its an accurate number. I, Karen Brown, Texas Nurses Association District 5, do officially swear... That, that number is accurate. Better? Look, I'm just trying get better understanding here... Good. Well, here's what you need to understand. Right? The major cause of these diseases, Hepatitis B... Hepatitis C, HIV are affecting all front line health workers... Is because of accidental needle sticks. - Okay? - Okay. The reason I'm here cause my client is has invented a safety needle... That could prevent this from ever happening again. Then don't talk to me. - Who should I talk to? - The purchasing department. Of course it is. Thank you. - Mr. Weismann. - Weiss. - Mr. Weiss. - Mike, please. Mr. Weiss, I cannot and went out look at your needle. Why? Because of the purchasing contracts on the hospital house. Well, will you at least look at this data? - No. - Would you mind telling me why? I don't want you to show me your data... And I don't want you to show this product at my nurses. Because they'll want it. And they can't have it. What kind of shirt was it? Was it a nice shirt? Just Mr. Phoenix's Eagle. It was nice. Was it is a special shirt? Special? Maybe it was a gift? It was just a shirt. How much did you say it cost? - I don't remember. - Let just say $70. Sylvia, can you... Try Mike again please? Not if you wanna leave here with all that 10 tiny little fingers, young man. I just left him a 5th message. - Mike. - Paul, you're awake. Great, listen.

Like we agree upon things and we do them together. - I said I was sorry. - 22 cases... I'm sorry! Did you get the file I sent over? I got it. GOPs are being bribed to buy certain products for the hospitals. It's a fucking pay a lesson. I've sent to the damn court already. In the 80s these GOPs got so big till they manage to pass a bill in congress. Allowing them 3% commission from the manufactures... They're supposedly negotiation with. - We got a great case here. - Yeah, we do. I'm sorry, what was your name again? - Susie. - Susie, would you give us a second please? - Sure, I'll be right outside. - Thanks. Look. Mike, I think we had a great case here. Potentially really great. But I need you to be practical with me for a minute... Like hospital letting people died because safety point cause 5 cent when they break. I'm in, alright. It just if this thing get too big... You'll agree to bring another firm to help out. Trust me, this thing gonna settle by Christmas. Well, it might not. They could drag out for years. It is a monopoly case. And we're not mean to trust... We are any kind of firm we wanna be, Paul. Come on, this is the one. It's gonna make us. It could be break us. It's gonna be extremely expensive. Dancort cannot afford to pay us. And I can't do enough... Injury cases on my own. Paul, for fuck's sake. What do you want me to say? I'm sorry, alright. I'm sorry I missed the fucking mob online.

I trained some of them. they got this... crazy patterns on their shirts these days. suppose to calm the patients, but... ends up making you feel dizzy. so, you said you had something for me? you know it's true what they say about the stages you go through... denial... anger... acceptance... bla bla bla... but it doesn't happen as cleanly as pamphlets tell you. In reality, it's a stew. Everything happens all at the same time just because we can't really get over the dark parts doesn't mean you can't get to the good ones. Sometimes the brightest light comes from the darkness places. Here you go. Thank you. Where did you get this? Don't worry where we got them from. Hey. - Hey.

I'm sorry. it's not how I meant for it to happen. not how you meanted to happen, Kim is pregnant, Mike. Fuck. I don't see how we can possibly continue the case. no... - Mike... Paul, listen... - You agreed, we would drop this. - I agree to take this to another firm. I never agreed to drop anything. I've called 15 other firms and no one would touch it. I'm not dropping the case. well that's not your decision to make. so you want to call Dancort or should I? it's too big, Mike. I have Senator O'Reilly calling in from Washington DC for you Mike? hello. and then the GPO, in our case United Medical Health Supplies, will drop an exclusive contract with Thompson Needles, who in turn give them a kick back, for every needle sold. boxing out any competition regardless of how superior or how much safer their product is. if Thompson Needles gonna come out with an actual safe needle, they'd have to retool recast the molding, they have to replace their entire assembly line, like starting from scratch. obviously something that they're not interested in doing because of the high upfront ingenious. this is a tremendous innovation. as you know, I have been addressing safety issues for hospital workers for years. I'm intrigue by your project, Mr. Dancort, to say the least. thank you. this is a build proposal mandating the use of Safety Needles. we're in the process of circulating a petition in every single hospital across the United States so we can mobilized nurses union and association to help you lobby. - Right. we have some interest from some financial institutions regarding investments packages and we're gonna try and get them in every hospital across the country. Senator, you're giving us the impedous to save thousands of lives. That was great... - Great job. I want to go to the bathroom - Alright. excuse me, Mr. Weiss? - Yeah. may I speak with you, just a second? - Yeah. Senator. - Mr. Weiss. I want to let you know, how much I appreciate you and your colleagues... bringing this to my attention. as I said, the safety and wellbeing of health care workers have been high on my agenda from day one and we also agree that urgent action is what is called for. that's great. it's good to meet someone on board to fight the good fight. it would be honor to offer my support but only if you drop this case. and let Mr. Dancort team up with another firm. the cocaine, under your nose. it's a... I'm not judging you, Mike. you're not the first person to lobby a senator hopped up on narcotic and I'm sure you not even the first person to do so, today there is absolutely no way we can put you before the house committee let alone the senate. wait... my client has approached every other lawfirm in Texas. they all said no. he's broke. this is... this is a major anti-trust case. you know, the type of money and muscle that goes into it. Mr. Dancort does not have the money. to sit across from the receptionist at some of these firms my partner and I are the only one who are willing to take this risk. we believe in this case. we believe in it. give me a chance. I'll go back to Houston, I'll get myself clean up. okay. but know this, you'll only get one chance. don't fuck it up! understand. they're talking to fucking senators now. it is when you're around knocking on doors. chicken with their heads cut off. we need to fix this now, Nathaniel. I'll take care of it. - We're losing patients. just need a bit more time. I'll try. but you need to hurry. or it's not gonna be good for any of us. this is a waste of time. - Mike. show some respect, huh? I'll show some respect by working the case that put her in the ground to begin with. fuck this. fuck. come on... the reason you... the reason why you should invest in Safety Point because it safe... and it's effective. it's a life. . saving... it's a live saving device... it's a live saving device you're involvement you alright, Mike? yeah, I'm fine. you want some? I was always more of a thinker than a businessman. that's how I've... thought about myself anyway. my first office was in the corner of a bicycle shop. my first customer was an amputee with an artificial leg. hi... good evening. I'm Paul Danziger. and I like to welcome you on behalf of my partner, Michael Weiss, and of course the man who really brought us together tonight Mr. Jeffrey Dancort. I've been doing this a long time now. long... long time. when I've come to realize that there's people out there that all they wanna do is fuck you up. right? you know what I'm talking about. so on this one, I just decided to say "fuck it". cause you know what? a good idea is a good idea. we're talking about people's lives here. saving people's lives... this girl is dead. because of what we're talking about here. so who gives a shit about the bottom line? I'll tell you who gives a shit. the Goddamn miserable sorry ass mother fucker who won't let the hospital use my needles asses. none of us in here might even make a dollar. the point is, that it's the point of Safety Point and I want you all to... think about helping us out. it's just a good... thing to be part of and... thanks for being here. done. thank you very much for coming and... how you doing Mike? I'm sorry. oh shit, Mike. people don't bring checkbooks to these things. can't do this anymore. Paul, let's go home. hey Silvia. go ahead and tell them I need an expert cause all the tracks on. and I don't want the pill treatment. I want the implant under the abdomen, not the posterior. not the posterior. I don't want anything in my ass that doesn't have to be. collapse veins, infection of the heart lining involves few abscesses beginning of liver disease minor pulmonary complications, and what could be the start of pneumonia. typical. he's going to withdraw. I had no idea. I mean... I knew he's taking some pain pills for his... leg... but I didn't... he's a pretty heavy user. it's a good thing I reactivated the insurance. by the way, the treatments he requested is gonna run about 25. and it's not covered by insurance. just a heads up. great. damn. hey. hey, you got my clothes? - Yup. don't you want me to get someone to check you out before we leave? I should bell a nurse. that's a great idea... we're always underestimating nurse I'll be right with you, Mr. Weiss. I have a question for you. you wouldn't happen to be a member of the Nursing Association? I'm standing here in front of the Houston Community National Hospital with the few hundreds nurses and assorted healthcare workers in protest. joining me now, is Karen Brown. president of the texas Nurse... every needlestick accident caused the hospital thousands of dollars in follow up testing. if it's with infected needle, between five hundred thousands and one million dollars per case, now in this country, there are roughly one million needlestick accidents per year. think about that. you do the math. what we're fighting for is the right of every citizen to live in a country that values human lives over profits. Mr. Weiss, the hospital... Senator O'Reilly's office. this is attorney Mike Weiss, for the Senator. hi Mr. Weiss, she just went to a meeting. can I take a message? sure. why are these here? I thought they were supposed to go out yesterday. they sent it back. what the hell is that? we had a contract. yes, please have the Senator return my calls as soon as possible. regarding the St. Antonio Memorial hospital canceling their contract with Safety Point syringe she would be interested to hear that the CEO of St. Antonio Memorial Hospital been invited to sit on the board of United Medical Health Supplies... yeah, you think she'd like to hear that on the news or return my calls? please have her call me back. this is attorney Mike Weiss. about to book a flight to DC, this is bullshit. Senator's chief aid called us this morning, she's labeling this issue. labeling the issue? what the fuck is that mean? I'm going down there. United Medical Health Supply just made a very generous contribution in Senator's what's this? Kim gave birth last night, to a baby girl. 6 pounds 8 ounces... Sam... she's beautiful. congratulations. I'll be home with them if you need me. what are we gonna do about the Senator? Morris, sex therapist. I like sex therapy. creeps me the fuck out. we should say something, right? probably. you wanna be the one? no. me neither. okay, thanks for the repaying the place, by the way. I know we're a little behind it's okay... don't worry bout it. I know, I'm gonna check a few fax and show it to you. no, I mean we don't need it from you anymore. look, I didn't I didn't want to bring this up here, but... really sorry, my firm... won't let me sub contract any more work to you guys. not while you're working on the Safety Point case. you serious? I'm sorry. you can keep the retainer. I wish there's something I could do but... no no... I understand. excuse me. okay. let me talk it over with my partner and my client, I'll get back to you in an hour. alright. that was Price, he wants us to come out to his house, tomorrow. his house? why? you said we'd settled by Christmas, maybe you right. I gotta call Dancort. Mike! hand me that bag. Mike, come on. give me the fucking bag! gentlemen... thanks for coming out. give me a few minutes to wash up. I'll be right with you. Stephanie will show you where the library. if you need anything, she'll be happy to get it for you, okay? right this way gentlemen. dial 9 if you need to get an outside line and I'll be just down the hall there to the left. if there's anything else I can do? we're fine. thank you. you got any fresh squeezed juice? I can check. orange is fine, grape juice preferable. I'll see what I can do. where's your bathroom? it's right here. how long do we have to wait? gentlemen... it's nice, isn't it? all the fresh air... okay. let's get down to business. first of all, thank you for coming here. Much appreciate it. Our pleasure. - Now, putting aside... the fact that Safety Point syringes having finances difficulties... one of our manufacturing client is ready to put an offer for it which I think you're gonna find satisfactory. - Where's that girl that showed us in. I'm not sure, Mr. Weiss. waiting on some juice. sure she'll bring when she can. like I said, one of our manufacturing client is interested in your company. for quite some time. - This generous manufacture wouldn't happen to be Thompson Needle, well they would like to remain anonymous until there's an accepted offer. and this... anonymous client would then own the patent to Safety Point? that's right. my client is interested in purchasing the equity that comes from Safety Points there'll be a contractional provision guarantee in certain production an distribution of the Safety Point syringe? once my client purchases Safety Point syringes, we'll have the right to do it as it see fit. and what do they see fit? Mr. Dancort, my client is prepared to make a more than generous offer. this is great. you know, your client is in direct violation of federal and state antitrust laws? you damn well know you won't win this case if you go to trial. you are a brilliant engineer, Mr. Dancort. try applying some of that to your business sense. I didn't sacrifice everything because I was looking for a big pay day. I just want my needles in those hospitals. sorry, Mr. Dancort. I truly am. I won't take any pleasure in seeing you ruining it. that proposal is only valid for 3 days. no negotiation. now gentlemen, I have taken enough of your saturday. Stephanie will see you out. look forward to your response. we have to take it. excuse me? - The offer. we have to take the money. - What do you mean? it's not good for Dancort, it is not fair... they made the offer, cause they they can't they're not scared, Mike. they're scared we'll take it to trial. do you... even really care if Safety Point needles end up in hospitals? seriously... I'm asking you a question. do I care? yes! people are dying. - That's what you care about? people dying? really? we're taking the settlement. - No, we're not. you want Dancort to walk away from millions of dollars, and then what, huh? what happens to him when we go to court... years form now? and he has lost his business and his house, and then... then after all that, we lose the case... we won't lose the case. - Okay, fine we don't lose. how do you want us to survive until then, Mike? we are broke... broke... broke... we have three weeks of overhead left in the bank. and united medical health supplies has pretty much paid off or pressured everyone in the United States of America from giving us any new work. so, how you gonna go and... rally people behind Jeffrey in court when you don't have a phone to call them and to tell them where to show up. I'm ending this! I'm not ending shit. I'll take a loan out of my house you are so fucking delusional... and you're a big pussy... who rather chase ambulances then the lot to save people's lives. - So you... care about people's lives? - Yeah, I do. - Really, who revolving troop of hookers you paid to hang out with? Your wife? - Oh, fuck you Paul. Like you really give a shit bout those pathetic scam with their neck braces and crutches. not just the settlement they bring in, right? you are so full of shit. you just wanna win, that is all you ever cared! at least I have the courage... to lose for what's right! I'll call Dancort and tell him you no longer involve with the case. I'll walk from here. Hey man. - Hey man, how you doing? Thanks. - Yeah. excuse me... I'm all set, man. Mr. Weiss, I used to work for Thompson Needles Manufactures. then go fuck yourself. I was a friend of Vicky's. she asked to come talk to you. thought it might be helpful. you got a car? yeah. follow me. up here. you see, up until the 1960... needles syringes are made of glass. which hospitals sterilized with heat. Thompson Needle Manufacture refuse to switch to plastic needles, despite the money they make. because plastic needles can't be sterilized. founder of the company, James Thompson, he was quoted as saying... "we'll switch to plastic needles, over my dead body". sure enough, in 1966... the year he died, Thompson Manufactures switched to plastic needle. within 10 years, Hepatitis C, and AIDS were on the map. they knew that they'd be responsible for spreading epidemic around the world... this tape... has footage taken by peace corps worker in Nigeria. look, see those kids? children... they get paid pennies, to bring used needles and syringes to local pharmacies. clinics save unhealthy-care by reusing needles at 200 times. this is what's going on, everywhere. Thompson Needles Manufactures they're not only NOT acting on this, they're actually suppressing the knowledge of it. the plastic syringe is the root that AIDS epidemic all across Africa. and Russia, and lndia... sorry, they made an offer to buy Safety Point. we're advising our client to take it. oh Come on Mike! you know if they buy it, they're not gonna use it. that needle can saves more than nurses here. . it can saves millions of lives around the world. I'm just a personal injury lawyer. not exactly the best place to go around saving people's lives. you know something, Mike? sometimes the brightest light... comes from the darkest places. get it. before it wakes the baby. hello. Jesus Christ, Mike. you'll wake the baby. I'll hang up now, alright? we could talk about it tomorrow. okay, sorry. I like people who are nuts. keep things interesting. do you know anything about the original glass needle manufactures? or anything about plastic syringes? you know, Michael. everyone goes to law schools, to become the good guy. Fight the good fight, for justice. is that what you did? Yes I did. - How's that working out? do you remember the big... tobacco lawsuits? - Of course. 7 CEOs under oath, lying in front of congress and on camera. and every states in the union sued them, right? - Right. do you remember what happen after that? - Yeah. they showed out a 165 billion dollars settlement, that's what happened. no, nothing happened. cigarettes are everywhere. new teenager starts smoking everyday. billions of people smoking worldwide. millions of people dying, every year. nothing happened. big tobacco got a spanking. slap on the wrist. and they went right back to business as usual. I assume you came here tonight to try and... convince me to do the right thing. I look in your eyes, and... like oh my God, you're right! then what? guys like me are like cafeteria trays, take one of the top, there's another one right underneath it. I'll bet you spent your whole life, claiming that you... you were born to do something great. make a difference, do something special. important. well, Michael... this is most ordinary thought anybody ever had. I'll see you in court. that might be difficult, since your client and partner already accepted the offer. you right. you might have settled with them, but you haven't settled with me. I'm gonna travel the country and making every hospital worker who's ever been infected every mother that lost a child, every child that lost a parent, I'm gonna put them on the stand. and I'm gonna tell them that your client has a needle that could have prevented it from but keeps it locked up. Cause it's cost too much to make. Trust me. You're about to see just how ordinary I can be. Good morning. - Good morning to you. What is this? That is a bonus for the hard work you've been doing. - Are you serious? - I am. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Listen, there is a long rambling message on the machine from Mike. Figures. Here he is now. You're up early. Yes? You the partner? - Yeah. Died in his sleep. So, this is your partner? Michael Weiss? Yeah. He died alone? Detectives will be able to answer some of those questions. They wanna talk to you bout something. Have you seen these needles before? It's a safety needle. can't be reuse. that explain why there's so many of them. are you okay, Mr. Dancort? could we offer you something to drink, tea perhaps? no, it's alright. Mr. Danziger. sorry to hear about Mr. Weiss. we offer our most sincere condolences. so, since we're all here we should probably hey boy... hello Nat. it's been a long time. you and me... we're going to court on this one. looking forward to it.
