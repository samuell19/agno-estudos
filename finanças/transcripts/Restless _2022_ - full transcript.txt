[suspenseful music playing] [cell phone ringing] What is it now? [woman] Where's your locker key? The key's with me. I told you a million times, Naomi. What about the inspection? Things are tense here at the station. Where are you? I'm almost there. You gonna keep calling me or what? I don't give a fuck. Deal with Internal Security yourself, because I have nothing to do with your schemes. - Is that clear? - [sighs] How long until they show up? Do you know? We don't know. That's the point of police investigating the police. God, those guys are dicks! That's also the point. What are we gonna do, Lieutenant? Nobody touches any of my stuff, you got that? [cell phone beeping] Yes, Agathe? [Agathe] Mind telling me what you're up to exactly? We finished with the paperwork. She's been taken down to the mortuary. They've started putting her in the coffin! Everyone's waiting. Listen, I didn't have a choice. How is Louise? How do you think she's doing? [sighs] Aga... Agathe! Fucking hell! Can't my own sister help me out? Fuck! [sighs] [punches steering wheel] - Where'd that dog come from? - [honking] Move! Move! Whoa, hey... Move, move, move! Oh, fuck! [panting] Such a fucking stupid dog! - [grunts] - [tires squealing] [panting] What the hell was that? Oh, shit. [switches off engine] Sir, you all right? Hey, sir? Sir? Oh, no... Shit! 112 EMERGENCY CALL - CALL [line ringing] [cell phone beeping] Hello? [child] Daddy? Louise, hi, sweetie. Daddy, I'm bored here. What are you doing? [tense music playing] Daddy? Hello? - Can you bring me a toy? - A toy? Uh... Hey, sweetie, ask your aunt, okay? Okay? Will you be here soon? Daddy will call you back, honey. [grunting] [tense music playing] [vehicle drives away] [sighs] Fuck me. [organ music playing] Talk to Thomas? [exhales] - What happened? - Uh, nothing. What do you mean? Listen, he told me he wanted to do it himself. Goddamn. Did you insist? How long have you been his partner? Eight? Ten years? Twelve. So what? So you, of all people, should know what an asshole he is. God! [exhales] Goddamn! Bullshit! They're here. Okay. Okay, thank you. They just passed through the entrance. I'm warning you, I'm not fucking up my training because of you guys. Relax. It will be fine. If Internal Security asks me about Thomas, what do I say? Nothing. We don't rat out colleagues. 'Cause the police... is one family. You got it? [sighing heavily] Fucking idiots! [Thomas grunting] [Thomas groans] [clicks tongue] [tense music playing] [sighs] Fuck, what the hell is that? Goddamn! - [cop blows whistle] - Yeah, yeah, I'll stop. [sighs] No... National Guard, good evening, sir. Hi, good evening. Be careful. [sighs] Ah... Look, I can't find it, okay? - Turn off the engine, please. - I told you I'm police. That enough? Vehicle inspection. Open the trunk. This is bullshit. Can't you just let me go now please? Please exit your vehicle and open your trunk for us, sir. You need to stop giving me orders. Is there a problem? He says he's police, but doesn't have his badge. Also, he's refusing to open his trunk. He's acting suspicious. I noticed his car is damaged. He must've been in an accident. That warrants a breathalyzer. Don't you feel like you're pushing it a little? Hey, okay, okay. I'm sorry, Chief. It's a misunderstanding, that's all. Good evening, sir. Hello, Lt. Blin of the Criminal Division. I'm sorry. I forgot my badge at the hospital. At the hospital? Yeah. My mother passed away, and I was heading to the mortuary. I'm running late, so, please, do me this one favor, as a cop. I'd be willing to do you a favor, sir, but isn't the hospital... in the other direction? Please tell me your badge number. 811403. Hey, hands off my car, if you don't mind. Badge has seven numbers, sir. Listen to me, this really isn't a good time. Let's calmly sort this out in the van. Follow me. No. Do what you need. I'll be right here. Hey! I told you not to touch my car. - [Chief] Hey, calm down! - Sir, hey! What are you doing? Get him! Get him! [grunts] Chief! Chief! Whoa, whoa, whoa! [screaming] [all coughing, groaning] [Naomi] Thomas keeps his cash in his locker? Great. [Marc] Can you think of a better stash spot than a police station? [Naomi] In any case, he's fucked now! [Marc] Yeah, okay, all right. Now hurry up. - No messing around. Just toss it all. - Who do you think I am? But not too much at once. We don't want it to clog. I'm doing my best, okay? [groans] Jesus, it stinks! - Come on, come on, keep going! - I got it. Fuck. [unintelligible] I'm deeply sorry, Lieutenant. Hey, this stays between us. Oh, you can count on me. [cell phone chimes] MARC THEY'RE HERE. DON'T COME. Are you sure you don't want an escort, Lieutenant? [car engine starts] Three hundred kilos of cannabis. Hidden inside frozen prawn packages. Yes. The drugs were being transported using the rip-off method. The drugs were first loaded into a standard commercial shipment, obviously without the shipping company's knowledge, and collected at the port of arrival in refrigerated containers by complicit dockers. I don't know about Paris but... Sorry, Commander. But here, everyone knows what a rip-off is. It's "Madam Commander." [scoffs] Are you here to administer a police academy exam or... No. I'll be examining your conscience. Oh, what's this? This investigation report from Internal Security suggests that police officers belonging to your unit are suspected of looking the other way when it comes to fraudulent activities. In exchange for bribes, big ones. [tense music playing] Shit. Is anyone there? [whirring] Daddy, your foot! You all right, sweetie? - Yeah. - I'm back now. Give me that. - You're okay? - It's about time. Where were you? - Why'd you get her a toy like that? - Obviously, she picked it out herself. Like father, like daughter. Why did you just leave me hanging? I'm sorry, but I'm here now. But they're ready to close the casket. I'm not going back in there. I couldn't bear it. [melancholy music playing] Well... We're going to go get some rest in the meantime. Yeah, that sounds good. Give daddy a kiss to give him some courage? I want to stay with you. No, sweetie. It's better if you stay with your aunt, okay? - I'll see you later. - Hang on. She wanted to be buried with this. It's important to her. [Madam Commander] Oh. So alcohol is allowed in the station? A local custom, perhaps. You drove two hours to go through my trash? I'm not sure you'll justify your expense reports with that. This is why we're gonna keep searching. Are your staff's private cars in the parking lot? - Yes. - Very well. - Could you take my men there? - [scoffs] - Naomi. - Yeah? If you please. Go ahead. Commander, excuse me, but about the alcohol, it's... That was an exception to the rule. A colleague's mother passed away recently. We wanted to have a toast in her honor. - That's all. - You mean Lt. Blin, I imagine? Yes. And? And where is this orphan cop? At the hospital funeral parlor. All right. Don't tell me you're going to harass him at a time like this? Well. May we proceed with the closing of the casket? Okay. You may place personal objects inside, if you wish to, even valuable objects. The room is outfitted with surveillance cameras to prevent anyone from robbing from the deceased. Gentlemen. [breathing deeply] [cell phone ringing] [cell phone chimes] THEY KNOW WHERE YOU ARE [tense music playing] - [cell phone chimes] - Excuse me. I'm sorry. THEY'RE GOING THROUGH EVERYTHING, EVEN THE CARS, YOU'VE GOT NOTHING IN IT? Is everything all right, sir? Would you like to sit down? No, it's fine. Thank you. [hammering continues] [tense music playing] [sound becomes muffled] [sound reverts to normal] [tense music continues] - [metal scraping] - [Thomas grunting] Shit! [grunts] [tense music ends] Excuse me. Could I spend a few more minutes with her, if that's okay? It's just... We're already past our normal closing time. I understand. Here you go, for your trouble. You have until ten o'clock. Thank you. And... And what are those for? They're for my kid. [breathing shallowly] [exhales heavily] I'm sorry, Mom. [gripping music playing] Come on. Come on! DISTANCE OF USE 4 METERS [sighs] There you go. There... That's good. Good. Okay, that's good. [fires machine gun] No, no, no, no, no, no! [muffled gunfire] [silence] Come on. [whirring] Come on. [muffled whirring] [grunts] [grunts] [firing machine gun] I'm sorry, Mom, I'm a rotten son. [rattling] Is someone there? [toy soldier fires machine gun] [knocking repeatedly] [silence] Did you hear that? I'm not sure. I'm gonna go call security. - [video game sound effects] - [phone ringing] Motherfucker! Yo. - [woman] Security? - Hmm? I'm in front of Room 1. We can't get inside and we're hearing strange noises. Could you check? [exhales] The video's out. It's weird. Do you have the key? Uh, yes, but I can't just leave my post like that. Let me tell the manager. So what do we do? They said to wait. They're sending someone. Wait for what? Yeah, you're right. We got better things to do. [groans] Come on! [controller beeping] Shit! [organ music playing] Come on... [grunts] [panting] Stop right there! [whoops softly] [panting] [gripping music playing] [spluttering softly] [gripping music ends] [exhales] [muffled heavy metal ringtone playing] [ringtone stops] [softly] Okay... It's okay... [heavy metal ringtone playing] No... No, no, no! Please hang up. Oh, please, God. Please, hang up! Just hang up. [ringtone continues] I'm sorry... [sighs] Is everything all right? Well... It's time. Hmm? Of course. Um, sir. The... The balloons for your kid. Oh, yes, of course. - Thank you. - Sure. [breathing heavily] [muffled heavy metal ringtone playing] [men grunting softly] - [man 1] Is this thing heavy or what? - [man 2] Don't drop it, it might open. [sorrowful music playing] I'll be back, Mom. I promise I'll be back. [crypt closing] Thomas is letting me stay here until I find something else. I was living with Mom, but... I'm making more tea. You want some? No, thank you. So you're staying? Yeah. That way I can help him a bit with Louise. Things haven't been easy for my brother since his divorce. Yeah, I know. I don't know what's keeping Thomas. An emergency. I didn't understand. No worries. I'll just see him at the station. Louise! Say goodbye to your godfather. - Anyway, it was nice of you to come. - No, it's no problem. I wanted to go to the service this morning, but Vaubour called in a crisis meeting. I couldn't get away. Are there problems? [toy siren wailing] Whoo! What a spiffy little police car. Agathe bought it for me. That's pretty nice of Agathe. [Agathe] I didn't have a choice. The other night, at the hospital, some psychopath stole her toy. - What? What a jerk! - Hmm. Marc, when is Daddy coming back? [pressure washer running] [siren wailing] [switches on engine] Exit the vehicle, sir. Lt. Blin from Criminal. It's dangerous to park in the street like that, you know. [machinery whirring] So Internal Security didn't come to the funeral parlor to search your car? - No. - That's good. That means they didn't find anything. - What do you think they'd find? - I don't know... There was a pretty fat bundle of cash in there, huh. Almost like you wanted to get caught. I didn't have a choice. I had to toss everything. You did good. [chuckles] This must be your way of thanking me. We'll split my share. Don't worry. No need. It's fine. Come on, Thomas. Don't pretend with me. The in-home medical care, the hospital bed... All that cash must have helped with your mom. Does Valérie suspect anything? Sorry? How long has your wife been depressed? She shoots up every night you're not home. You paid a ton for her rehab in Switzerland. So what do you tell her? That the risk premiums have gone way up? That actually, being a cop pays really well? That it's worth putting her through hell until you retire? That what you been feeding her, Marc? Why are you bringing my wife into this? Why are you bringing up my mom? Sorry to bother you, but an informant gave us a big perpetrator and the boss is ecstatic. He wants us to raid his house. We gotta move! - I need some cartridges for the Benelli. - Yeah. What's all this gear? - This? - Yeah. These are C4 packages with time delay. [hisses] That's pretty cool! How do they work? Hang on. Look. This is the detonator that can be remotely triggered by Bluetooth. Yeah. This is the emitter, inside this plastic case. It's really discreet, like any key chain. - Yeah, cool. - After that, it's simple. You just need to push the button, here, the timer is preset to two minutes. Once it hits zero, boom! Are you done flirting, showing off your stupid toys? Hand me my vest and cut the chit-chat. A hundred bucks says this rots on the shelves. Couldn't we test it? You need training to use C4. Knock it off. You just press a button. We might need it to blow up a door. [chuckles] And us with it? No thank you. Nice try. Here. M3 will do fine. We're not dealing with Godzilla here. - All right, thank you. - See you. - See you. - See you. - He was hitting on you. - No. - Certainly is. - Absolutely not. [Vaubour] Meet your new girlfriend. Manuel Barcelo. Already indicted for drug trafficking, associating with criminals and pimping. And to top off that great resume, he's wanted by Interpol. If we catch him, it'll look good given our current situation, right? After that Internal Security bitch's appearance the other day, it'd be good for our image. - Do we have to say "bitch"? - Uh, well, yeah. Let's go. Come on, move it. Thomas, what are you doing? Yeah, I'm coming. [sighs] [tense music playing] - Anything? - Nothing. Where did that asshole go? [exhales] No one here. We're sure he lives here. I think he smelled a rat and took off. [Marc] No, he didn't smell anything. Someone snitched on us, that's all. What should we do? [Vaubour] We look for clues. He couldn't have just vanished like that. That's impossible. Come on, let's move it! Shit, we look stupid! [growls] [dog whimpers] Can I help you, sir? What are you doing here? Lt. Blin. - Brigadier Bertin. Hello, Lieutenant. - Hello. Somebody reported a car accident. It must have been here. Any injured? Yes, it was a hit and run apparently. Ah. - And who filed the report? - Anonymous call. Where did you go? Did you find anything? Yes, this gentleman. - Brigadier Bertin. Hello, sir. - Lt. Andrade. What are you doing around here? Someone reported a car accident on the night of the 9th. Really? So what happened? A reckless driver ran over a man, put the victim in his trunk and took off. [laughs] That guy has got some serious balls. - Do you have any leads? - Not yet. But I need to check the surveillance camera footage. [tense music playing] Ah, well, maybe we'll find something on our guy too. Yeah, could we look at the tapes or no? You want to see the security tapes tonight, Lieutenant? Not Lieutenant. I'm an officer-in-training. Well. Okay. See you later. See you later, Bertin. - I can take care of the video footage. - No, no. It's fine. It's fine. Thomas, you go home. Naomi, you can write up the intervention report. What? I did not sign up to be a secretary. I have to do paperwork again? I'll handle it, all right? Thomas. You head home. Hey, you need to take a breather. Go on, spend some time with your kid. It'll be good for both of you. Okay? - Marc, just drop it... - No, no, it's... Stop. Stop. Discussion's over. It's Marc who's going. All right. Well, let's go! Now! You guys piss me off. All of you. - And her. - [Marc] Come on, let's go. [Naomi] You're a pain in the ass. You and your reports. [Marc] Sounds like you're acclimating, Naomi. We've got it, Lieutenant. The recordings from the 9th. - Hey! - Surprise! What are you doing here? You're so fucking stubborn. I told you to just go home. I couldn't let you guys starve over here. - Oh! Fried chicken? - Yeah, on me. [laughs] Delicious. - Good evening. - What's up? Have any leads? Anything on the accident? It happened here, but we can't see well. The image is cut off. Yeah, the quality is pretty bad. Mmm. Come on, let's eat. Wait, wait, wait. One second. - Rewind a little bit. - What? I said rewind a bit. [tapping keys] Stop. Now go frame by frame. Pause. That's him. I'm sure. - Look at the brake lights. - [Bertin] So what? "So what?" All the cars drove by without turning on their brake lights, except for this one. That means, at some point, the driver saw somebody walk out onto the road. He hit the brakes, too late. And bam! He ran over the guy. Show me the photos. Oh, yeah. It fits. The skid marks, the brake lights, and the debris from the impact. Check out that dog. He's looking at the accident. It's gotta be there, for sure. Come on, back up a bit. That's a gray BMW. Just like yours. Yeah, looks like it. Zoom, zoom, there on the plates. What's the first letter? I see a "D." Yeah. Yeah, a "D," that's right. You agree? No, I would say that's an "O." No, that's not an "O." Hang on, let's see the second one. Goddamn! Aw, shit! Too blurry. We can't see a thing. Come eat. It's getting cold. Come on. [door opening] What's up. Hello. You good? When are they coming to take Mom's bed? Do you know? No, I've called them three times. Louise is in bed? Of course. Have you seen the time? Sorry, but I tried my best. You're not spending time with her lately. Would you rather I quit? Oh, hey. I wanted to ask you about Mom's apartment. Do you think I could move in there? It would be pretty nice for my yoga. And I wouldn't bother anyone. What do you think? I think that someone's renting it and they're on a lease. We can't just evict them. Well, you're a cop, after all. I don't get what you mean. [sighs] Oh, hey... Did you know she had a lover? - Who did? - Our mother. Our mother had a lover? What? Yes. Listen to this, at the end of yoga, I was laying in Shavasana. You know, it's the corpse pose. All of a sudden, I had a vision. A flash. Like I did with your divorce. And I was right about that. Yeah, great vision. So what's this one about? Okay, I saw a man close to Mother... lying right up against her. A younger man. I was shocked. [gunshots] - Come on, keep going. - Yeah. Okay. Here we go. Get in the right position. Widen your stance. Yes, Lt. Blin, Criminal Division. [man] I would like to report a man who's currently wanted by the police. Could you write this down? I'm out of the office. You'll have to check with one my colleagues. I saw Manuel Barcelo. What did you say? I said I saw Manuel Barcelo. Sir, if this is a joke, it's really not funny. What? Is it a crime to report a wanted man? - Okay, go ahead. - You have something to write with? Yeah, I'm listening. I saw Manuel Barcelo. Okay. You've already told me that. So where is he? I was just about to ask you. Okay, what kind of game are you playing? Tell me, Lt. Blin, where did you take him? What now? What did you do with him after you loaded his body into your car? - Into my car? - Yeah. Now you're just making shit up. A gray BMW. That's the one, right? Put up a new target and keep practicing. Okay, thank you. Thomas? Look. Three in the chest, one in the head, all 25 meters away. [phone ringing] - That's progress, huh? - Yeah, yeah. I'm going to show it to Marc. [cell phone ringing] UNKNOWN NUMBER You're not picking up? No, it's nothing. [cell phone ringing] Hello? Okay, I can tell him. This guy is saying he wants you to answer. [cell phone ringing] - Hello? - I think we got cut off. I haven't finished my deposition, Lieutenant. Who the fuck are you? Someone who knows you killed Manuel Barcelo. No, I don't understand you at all. Who are you? All right, Thomas, come on. This is getting embarrassing. No, sir, this has to be a mistake. It's a misunderstanding. Don't be so tense. After all, your car looks brand new now, right? My car? No, just got into an accident. A minor crash. It was covered by my insurance. So I'm telling you again, you're mistaken. [chuckles] That's so cute. You even thought of an alibi for your car. Well done. - Enough. Stop calling me, asshole. - [car brakes squeaking on phone] What if I told the police where you buried Manuel Barcelo? [car brakes squeaking in parking lot] That's it, I'm hanging up. Careful, Thomas. If you hang up, I'll have to give you up. Don't hang up. So you did kill him. - You fucking son of a bitch. - Calm down, Thomas. Calm down. Who the fuck are you? Where'd you come from? I'll let you think this over. Don't you worry, we'll talk soon. One last thing, don't try to outsmart me, you hear? You can't outsmart me. [mutters] [grunts] [exclaims] [panting] [dramatic music playing] [music stops] You okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Yeah. Where you going? Oh, well, nowhere. I mean... I just came down to get my phone, that's all. Hey. What happened to your car? It looks brand new. Got into an accident yesterday. I didn't tell you? No. That's all. They changed the entire front? Yeah, no, I don't even know why. Well, the important thing is you weren't hurt. Yeah, no, I'm totally fine. - All good. See you. - Wait up. The Marin Cemetery, that's where your mother is buried, right? Yes, why do you ask? Because I got some intel. Listen to this, it's where Barcelo's cell was active the last time. And? And, well, nothing. The area is too big. There aren't enough cell towers. It's impossible to triangulate accurately. - That really sucks. - Yeah, it does. - Okay. - Mmm. [cell phone ringing] - Your phone? - Yeah, my phone. You forgot it again. No, no, I got it this time. - Well, I'll see you upstairs. - Okay. [cell phone continues ringing] Hello? [man] For a cop, you really suck at car chases. What the hell were you doing? I was waiting for you. Well? Did you think it over? Can we talk now? Go ahead, I'm listening. That's good. You're beginning to see reason. - I just have one question first. - I'm listening. I was wondering how did you see me bury Barcelo in the middle of the night? Darkness is no obstacle, my friend. I'm like a cat. I've got night vision. Cat, my ass. You saw nothing, you know nothing. So listen to me closely. You can go turn me in now. I don't give a fuck. Dig anywhere, you're not gonna find Barcelo. So I'm going to hang up now and you can go fuck yourself, you fucking asshole! God! Fucker! Okay. [exhales] Tell me, does a surveillance camera record all vehicles entering and existing the parking lot? Affirmative, Lieutenant. All vehicle movements are recorded. Would you like to consult the list? Yes, I'd like to see all activity starting from this morning. - Is that possible? - Yup. UNKNOWN NUMBER [silences phone] Oh, no, don't send me anything. I'll come over to get them myself. Thank you so... Why aren't you answering my calls? Hey, whoa! What are you doing? Why aren't you answering my calls, huh? - Why aren't you answering? - What is this? [Thomas panting] Thomas? [man] A cop? What do you mean a cop? [Vaubour] What did you think? This is a police station. A robber. I thought he was a robber. You know him? Of course I know him. He's Lt. Blin. He's part of my team. - Do you have a problem with him? - Oh, no, no problem. Except that I guess I made a mistake. It's not him. So sorry. - I know striking a colleague is wrong. - Hmm. You won't believe me, but I'd mistaken you for someone else. A robber. Sorry. Are you okay? Again, my sincerest apologies. Lt. Blin, is that it? Commissioner Marelli. Miss, where's the bathroom? Do I look like the toilet attendant? End of the corridor, in our locker room. I just can't believe I got the wrong guy. I don't know how that happened. You know that asshole? I graduated the same year as Marelli, yeah. That's Antoine Marelli, head of Narcotics? Exactly, yeah. In the flesh. - [Marc] What's he doing here? - No idea. We should report this, right? No. No, we better not, no. That guy can beat up Thomas, and go take a piss and we do nothing? That's exactly right. We do nothing. We do nothing and we say nothing. Yeah. What? Naomi. But, Commissioner, your friend, your former classmate, he's a psychopath, he's bipolar. He needs to be committed. Firstly, he's not my friend. Also, I'd love to hear more of your informed diagnosis of personality disorders. Finally, he's the one who blocked the Internal Security investigation. What? Wait, how did he manage to do that? He couldn't stand that Internal Security was snooping around drug busts. It's Narcotics' territory. One phone call and everything's over. Anyway, he saved all your asses, didn't he? Oh, so we should be thanking him on top... Naomi, the police... ...is a family, I know. - Can I please take a smoke break, Chief? - Yeah. [sighs] Leave it. I can handle it. We'll have a calm discussion. [toilet flushing] You scared me. So you're a cop? [chuckles] That worries you, huh? The police always make one nervous, especially one with a guilty conscience. What are you saying? The universe mocks the morals of men. Honest people die in spite of being honest. Evil people thrive in spite of their sins. It's a shame but it's a fact. Especially for the police. Isn't that right, Lieutenant? - What do you want? - It's about time. That's the first relevant question you've asked. I want you... to bring me Barcelo tonight. And why? Ah, curiosity killed the cat, my friend. Just bring him to me and we're good. See, I don't know how that can be arranged. Because I have no idea where he is. [laughs] I don't think you and I are seeing eye to eye. [dramatic music playing] [groaning] [grunts] Get out! Get out of there! [grunting] [muffled shouting] Stop squirming around! Stop squirming around! Submerging the airways will lead to bradycardia. Your heartbeat will drop and continue to slow down. Come on, hold on! Hold on. [gasping, coughing] - Come back! There you are! - No! There you are! Look at me! Look at me! To avoid cardiac arrest, the best thing to do is to reduce your body's need for oxygen. - Yes. No, no, no! - Round two. Here we go. [muffled shouting] Limit any muscular strain. Remain completely relaxed! Stay focused on your vital functions. There you go! That's it, that's good. That's very good. That's quite good. There. That's very good. [gasping] Okay. I didn't hear. Okay, I can do it. Ah, apnea really has its benefits. Have I told you that? Good. Gotta go. Got other things to do. Besides, two guys alone in the bathroom for this long, people are gonna suspect things, don't you think? [panting] [water running] And don't forget. You'll bring me Barcelo tonight. I'll be in contact with you. [door slams shut] I'm sorry, Mom. MARIE-JEANNE BLIN MARCH 21 1930 - MAY 9 2021 - REST IN PEACE [grunting] Why the fuck is he looking for a dead man? Can you explain that? There's gotta be a reason. BATTERY LEVEL LOW What the fuck is that? Oh, fuck! What is this? [laughing] [chimes] SECURITY SAFE SERVICES PRIVATE VAULTS [heavy metal ringtone playing] [man] Fuck, Manu, I've called you 20 times. You could've picked up. I was starting to think Marelli took you out. Where are you now? Could you say something, bitch? Fuck! You're not Manu. Who are you? Shit, who are you? [line disconnects] [Naomi] The number belongs to Michael Bourgi, 38 years old. He was convicted several times for fraud and computer piracy. Basically he's a hacker. He grew up in the same neighborhood as Barcelo, and the two of them were recently spotted together. Track his location for me, minute by minute, and send the photos to my phone. You're asking a lot. We first need to get a warrant from a judge. Don't worry, I'll take responsibility. - Hey, was that Thomas? - Yes. - The fuck's he doing? - That's what I'm wondering. Goddamn. You're still working? Yes, and I have to deal with the team's reports. Well, I'll help you out. Okay... Hmm. [laughs] 120 km/h in a 50 zone. Shit, that's not a small infraction, huh. No shit. [tense music playing] [sighs] [exclaims] Hey, where the fuck do you think you're... Police! Move, move, move, move! Everyone, go. - Everyone! - I didn't do anything. My arm! Let go of me! - Okay, stay calm. - Motherfucker! That's right. There. Come here. Let me go! WE'RE OPEN SORRY WE'RE CLOSED [machines beeping] I don't know anything. - Sure you don't know anything? - Yeah. I told you I know nothing! Let me go. Please. Let's start with an hour of drying. What? No, no, no! Wait! I promise, I'll talk! I promise. Why is Marelli after Barcelo? - I don't know! - All right, I believe you. - Okay. - I swear I don't know anything! I don't know anything! I swear! I swear! [muffled screaming] Here's what we're gonna do. I propose an hour and a half at 60 degrees. I like that because it doesn't shrink the clothes. - Motherfucker! - Or maybe 80. I can't decide. Is that better? You decide. Eighty would be better? - [muffled] You fucking psycho! - I can't hear you. I'm gonna set it to 80. - Okay, you ready? - Just wait! Wait! I'll tell you everything! - What? - I'll tell you everything! All right, there you go! [panting] I'm listening. Marelli is trying to find a key. What key? The key to open a vault. And what's in this vault? I don't know! Hey, I don't know. - Fine, let's go. - I swear! Let's do this. Hold on to your head! - You're in for a wild ride. - Wait! - Let's go! - I'll tell you everything! - [panting] - What's inside that fucking vault? The money. The money from the drugs. What are you on about? Oh, fuck. What are you saying? Marelli, he took advantage of his position at Narcotics to stash some of the drugs he seized during searches. [organ music playing] Narcotics keeps these enormous quantities. They're supposed to destroy all of it. And that's where Marelli and Barcelo came in. They diluted the drugs in alcohol. They sold them in private clubs. [upbeat music playing] Business was great. Just one taste and people were instantly hooked. Marelli's network was expanding every single day. The Ukrainian Bratva, the Irish, the Chinese. Everyone wanted to go into business with him. Marelli was becoming a major player and he just loved it. But Manu, all of it kind of twisted his mind. He sold all the drugs to the Albanians behind the boss' back. Marelli was furious. - The guys were killed off. - What? They were found in a fridge hacked into pieces, stashed in the hull of a tugboat. The problem was that the drugs had vanished. Manu had taken the money to store it in a vault he had the key to. [Thomas] And where is this key? [Bourgi] On him. Well, inside him. [exhales] Goddamn, what the fuck am I even doing here? [squelching] [gags] Fuck me... Come on... [groaning] Thomas, don't move! Don't move. - What are you doing? - Marc, I'm not the one who did it. Drop the knife now. - Drop the fucking knife now! - Okay, okay! What the hell is that? Come on, toss it. I said give it to me! Listen, I can explain everything. I'm not the one who killed him. So what are you doing here? Now put your gun down and I'll explain. Are you going to explain this report also, huh? You're going to explain it? Your car had been damaged the day before your accident. I swear I'll explain everything. Just lower your gun! Marc, calm down. Take these. Put the handcuffs on. Marc, stop it. Put them on, I said! Right now. Marc, let's talk this over, okay? We'll talk this out. I'll tell you everything. Okay? - We're not perfect cops. - Okay. But this is crazy. - Marc, what are you doing? I swear... - Shut up! Homicide, hit-and-run, removal of a body, do you understand? Those all carry a life sentence with a minimum of 20 years. What the fuck were you thinking? You got nothing to say? Have you thought about Louise? Did you give a damn about her? How old will she be when you get out? Huh? And what will you have done for her in all those years? Nothing. Fuck, I would've given anything to be a father. And you... You're a fucking dumbass. What are we doing here? Why aren't you taking me in? Hello, it's Andrade. Are we meeting at the usual spot? Okay. [sighs] It's gone too far, Thomas. I'm done. I'm returning the money and telling the guys we won't cover for them anymore. Don't thank me, I'm not doing this for you. What is this? I'm being blackmailed by a cop. Which cop? Marelli, head of Narcotics. Shit. It's true, that day I hit a guy with my car. But he was already dead, been shot twice. - And when... - [cell phone ringing] - Hello? - [Marelli] It's me. Lt. Andrade is next to you, right? Yeah, why? - Is your colleague sitting next to you? - That him? Get out of the car. It's important. I need to talk to you. [sighs] Okay, I got out. Where are you now? Shut up. Keep walking. Do you see the sewer grate in front of you? Yeah. All right, take a few more steps. Okay, I'm there. Then don't move. Where the fuck are you? Hello? - Hello? - [line disconnects] That asshole hung up. No... [metal creaking] [cell phone ringing] UNKNOWN NUMBER [Marelli] Did you see that? My dock worker's got good aim. Very precise. [Marelli chuckling] Are you crying? He's crying. Don't tell me you're sentimental? - Why'd you do that? - All right, back to business. You had no reason to do it. I told you I was on board. Quit bawling. And bring me Barcelo in the morning. You know what? It's over. I give up! It's over for you too! You fucking hear me? I'm telling them everything. Oh yeah? You're gonna spill everything? [scoffs] Are you sure about that? Hang on a minute. [doorbell ringing on phone] [woman] Who is it? This is Commissioner Marelli. I'm the one who called you. Nice to meet you. [Agathe] Thomas isn't home. - Where are you? - [Marelli] I'm on the phone with him. - [Agathe] Come in. - Listen. Listen to me! Okay, okay. I'll bring you the corpse. Good evening, little lady. Good evening. - You must be Louise. - Yes, that's me. Hey! Hey, don't hurt them. I'm begging you. I'll bring you the body just don't hurt them. Don't hurt my daughter! I'm begging you! [line disconnects] [dramatic music playing] [honking] Louise? Louise! - Thomas, are you okay? - Where is he? Well, your friend said he'd come back later. He couldn't stay. Are you okay? I'm fine. I'm just very tired, that's all. Well. She wanted to wait. She just fell asleep. [cell phone chimes] UNKNOWN NUMBER NEXT TIME I'LL TEAR HER EYES OUT BRING ME THE BODY GPS: N 51"03"11 - E 2"18"40 - [Agathe] Why so far? - [Thomas] Be nice to take a trip, right? You decided this just now? You've been wanting to go on a trip. This is your chance. Sure you don't want to come too? No, I told you. I really gotta finish that report. I'll come after. I promise. - So finally gonna get Godzilla? - Yeah, that's right. You won't be disappointed. This is good stuff. - To trigger the detonator... - I press this button, right? - Yeah, that's it. - Got it. Still, be careful. Don't worry. [suspenseful music playing] There you go. You wanted the body, you son of a bitch, I'm bringing you the body. I'm bringing you the body. Here. [suspenseful music continues] [cell phone ringing] Hello? [Marelli] Don't come any closer. Stop right there. Bring the body. [exhales] [Thomas panting] Put it there. We had agreed no guns. Back up. [static] [beeps] It's my keys, okay? Turn around. [beeps] Nice and cozy. - The two bullets, that was you? - Yeah, that was me. I shot him and then you ran him over. So what do you think? Who killed him? You or me? You wanted him, you got him. You want a receipt? [chuckles] Okay, I'm out. [tense music building] Thomas. You're a little smartass, huh? I realized you wanted to use my service weapon to make it look like a suicide. I scheduled an email for tomorrow morning if you kill me. It's all in there. The seized drugs you stole, the hooker bars, how you murdered Barcelo. As well as Lt. Andrade. You killed my best friend, you motherfucker. I know it's just a fraction of all the shit you've done, but it's enough to get you life. Is that all? That all you've got? [laughs] What now? You want to kill me? Go on, shoot! Shoot and it's over for both of us. Come on, try me. Shoot! What, are you scared? Are you gonna shoot or drop the gun? Go ahead, I'll watch! [sighs] [car boot closes] [engine switching on] [quietly] Why is that asshole coming back? Hey, just leave me alone now. Here, take back your gun. A cop losing his service weapon looks bad and leads to an investigation, and that's never good. Fucking blanks, I can't believe it. Here. All right. - Thomas, come here. Thomas! - [sighs] Fuck this. - Thomas, come here. - What? Your little scheme at the docks, you deserve better. - You could make serious money with me. - Leave me alone! [dramatic music playing] [shouts] [grunts] [engine revving] [panting] Get out! You thought you could fuck me over? [grunts] I'm gonna torture you. [laughs] Huh? [clicks] [both grunting] [clicks] No! [fires] [wheezes] [emotional music playing] Okay, let's go. [Louise] You didn't forget to feed the fish? [Thomas] Yes, don't worry. Sweetie, I gotta hang up now, all right? Daddy's at work, but I'll call you back later. I love you, Daddy. I love you too. [car engine starting] [melancholy music playing] So to sum it up. Misappropriation and trafficking of drugs, killing a police officer, hit-and-run, corpse removal, theft and use of explosives. You're really gonna have to bury all this shit, Vaubour. - You able to do that? - Affirmative, Superintendent. If any of this gets to the new prefect, it'll be the end of us. Nothing will get out. Man's word. In the event that it does, Vaubour, you'll be taking the hit for it. Civil servant's word. What about Lt. Blin? I knew I'd find you here. Vaubour told me you were leaving the force. Sorry. I wasn't in the mood for going-away drinks. What are you going to do? You got any projects or... I'm going to try to be a dad. At any rate, it's great that you gave your severance pay to Marc's wife. It's not gonna bring him back but... No, it won't bring him back. Vaubour told me you passed your training period. Yesterday. Hey, bravo! Thank you. You're the future now. So don't be like us. Actually, Vaubour put me in charge of investigating Marc's death. After his body was transferred to forensics, we meticulously searched the vehicle he was in. What was left of it anyway. And so? And I'm of the opinion it would be best if nobody found this. Like that Internal Security bitch. Right? This is the last time I get involved in this. I just didn't want Marc's memory to be tarnished. That's all. Thank you, Lieutenant. "Madam Lieutenant." [melancholy music playing] Your pass? [tense music playing] Insert the key and enter your code. Thank you. Is this for a withdrawal? - Yeah. - How much? All of it. [beeps] SECURITY SAFE SERVICES Come on. [upbeat music playing] [melancholy music playing]
