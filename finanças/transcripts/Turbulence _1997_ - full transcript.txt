- Merry Christmas. - You, too. Thanks. Oh. Excuse me. Got him. Lieutenant, you were right. He was in the toy store... ...And he bought a stuffed animal. He's on his way to see a new girlfriend. How can you be so sure? I don't have to see her. I know Weaver. She's about 5'7 ", 5'8", blonde, not the platinum kind. She's about 125 pounds. Probably a college graduate. Definitely well-read. Weaver likes to talk, and he wants someone who can talk back. You see that Teddy bear he's carrying? What about it? Murder comes next. He's in the wooing phase. I spent the last two years of my life one step behind this son-of-a-bitch. He's a piece of shit. Don't you two ever forget it. Look, lieutenant, this isn't L.A. so just stay cool. Hold it. Hold up, guys. Coming! Merry Christmas, Laura. Oh, Ryan, he's so cute. Yeah, I thought so, too. I'm sorry about not getting it wrapped. I... I was just in such a rush to get it to you. No, you didn't have to wrap it. I love it. And I love you. Come here. Sit down. You're the best thing that's happened to me in a long time. You know that? Give me a kiss. Down! Get down! Police! On the floor with your hands behind your back! Give 'em to me. Give 'em to me. Roll him over. Over! What's going on? Take it easy. Easy. Hello, Weaver. What are you doing? Now, what the hell's the matter with you? 5'7" and blonde, huh? That guy's out of his mind. Come on, get him on his feet. Come on. Merry Christmas. Oh. Hi, ray. I was, uh, expecting Stephen. Mr. helfet, told me to give you this. Where is he? Ah, he didn't stay. Thank you, ray. I did not get out of control. They're exaggerating. I did not beat him. - I restrained him. - We don't need another problem with you, I've got enough to deal with here. No... there will not be an incident on the plane. Well, that's because you're not going. You're not going, hines. Alright. Alright, alright. I'm coming back. What are you, my chaperon? After what happened today? Yeah, lieutenant, I am. Lieutenant? Is that thanks to me? I'm going back to L.A. I'll be waiting for you on the tarmac. They won't let you fly back with me, will they? I don't want to wait around. You're always lying. You know, I think a little honesty would be good for our relationship right now. Don't you? You should tell me something. How'd you plant that evidence in my car? If it were true, what difference would it make? Knowing what you did? I mean, you're a cop. How... How do you look at yourself in the mirror? I like what I see. I'm proud I got you off the street. Is it fame? Is that why you screwed me? Did you wanna solve one big case before you retired? You got your promotion. You gonna write a book now? You didn't even make the evening news. See? You watched. I mean, this must really burn your ass. You go through all of this, you track me down for two years and you still get no respect. L.A.'s a tough place for a killer. You have a lot of competition out there. You should've killed a celebrity. I never killed anybody. And you know it. Yeah, right. Wow, look at this. Boy, somebody really got into the Christmas spirit. It's so pretty. Two crews made a bet over who could do the best decorations. - And this was the loser. - You're kidding. I'm so junior, I get all the holiday flights. Now, come on. Only five passengers, and we get to spend Christmas in L.A. Now, wait a minute. We may have our hands full. Yep, it's now 11 passengers. Ooh, six more. It's still a piece of cake. No. Six men. Faa 2-14. Estimated flight time to L.A. is five hours, 49 minutes. Could get a little bumpy along the way. So, who are these prisoners we're transporting? I don't know. One of them is a bank robber. The other one is the uh, "lonely heart strangler." Leave it to, Uncle Sam to cast a cloud on Christmas. Hi. No. When did that happen? I don't know. Did you flatten my coat? I didn't flatten your... No, no, no, no. Sit there. I wanna sit on the aisle. I like to sit on the aisle. I should sit on the aisle. Please, don't argue. Teri, I... I don't want to hear you say you were right all along. You said I was rushing in London. No, you know, look. At least you didn't do what I did and marry the wrong guy after a five-minute romance. You did that? I did it twice. I mean, I am just now getting over the need to make men happy. It's pathetic. You've got so much time. You've got your whole career ahead of you. You know? Really. Just wait for the right guy to come along. Whoa, whoa. Faa regulations. Please step off the vehicle. I'll stow it for you. You live in L.A.? My dad does. Seats and lavatories clear. Coming on board, now. Merry Christmas. Okay, you're four rows down on the left. I need a 28.8 Jack immediately after takeoff. Is that a problem? Hey, captain. You're late. I specifically requested you be here before the other passengers were on board. It was my understanding the flight was almost empty. I'm sorry. I think you'll find everything in order there. Okay. Four weapons. That's it? Nothing else? I carry a .38 backup. It's not on the manifest. Most pilots don't have a problem with it. I do. If it's not on the manifest, it has to ride up front with me. I'm afraid you'll have to hand it over. What are you looking at? Shut up. I want the restraints kept on for the entire flight. We weren't planning on taking them off. Okay, let's go. Come on. Don't fucking push me, man. Come on. Stubbs, any more verbal abuse, and I will gag you. Hi. Excuse me, miss. What's the movie? It's a wonderful life. Really? What's the name of that song that Jimmy Stewart was singing... Come on. With Donna Reed? They were walking down... Let's go. Main street. Boo! Cool it. Yeah, that place was great. I loved it there... medium long shot. I mean, you never push... Right here. Uh-huh. Middle seat. Middle seat. Can I take this one? Don't worry about the coat. Just sit down. Hey, you know, you really shouldn't do that. Shouldn't do what? Make eye contact with these guys. You never know what they could be up to. What did they do? You know the guy with the dark hair? The one who likes you? He's a convicted serial killer. Mmm-hmm. Are you kidding? He raped and killed five girls, one of the maintenance men told me. Plus, he said that some cops, 'cause his cousin's one, said that Weaver couldn't have done it. Hmm. A perfect argument for capital punishment, huh? He doesn't look like a serial killer. Did you ever see Ted Bundy? What he looked like? He was a real charmer. Mark harmon played him in the TV movie. Pennsylvania, Ohio, and the eastern portion of New York state. What's that? If it's not on the manifest, it's not on the airplane. I swear, those guys have seen too many dirty Harry movies. Checklist. - Doors? - Closed. Cabin preparation? Complete. Call for pushback. This one always sticks. Season's greetings from the cockpit. We will fortunately be leaving New York before this latest blizzard hits. We still face a rough ride due to weather. Flight time is five hours and 49 minutes. It's about 20 minutes longer than usual. The latest Los Angeles weather is overcast skies with rain showers. Welcome aboard. Hello and welcome aboard. Whenever we fly, wherever we fly, we at transcontinental take time to ensure your safety, we've posted the no smoking sign... Federal law prohibits... and lavatories. And now, please fasten your seat belts. Put the metal into the buckle and pull on the loose end of the strap to tighten... The 747200 is equipped... The cabin crew will now clean off... Trans con 47 heavy, you're cleared to take off on 31, left via the outer, hotel and zulu. Your sequence is gonna be behind the twa 10-11 on the hotel. Roger, cleared to 31 left, outer, hotel and zulu, to follow twa 10-11. Trans con 47 heavy. Flight attendants, please be seated for takeoff. Trans con 47 heavy, condition on hold, runway 31 left. I hate these icy takeoffs. Armed. Checklist is complete. You're cleared for takeoff, trans con 47 heavy. Trans con 47 rolling. Powers good, we have four stable engines. Trans con 47, contact departure. Have a good day. Roger, trans con 47. Thank you. I'll flip you for lower business. That's your section. Yeah, normally, but today's not a normal day. Those prisoners give me the creeps. I would've thought you'd take them as a sympathetic gesture. Yeah, well. I'm not as patient as you are. Heads or tails? Heads. It'll take your mind off Stephen. Thanks a lot. What would you like to drink? Heineken. Merry Christmas. Can I get you something to drink? Yeah. Orange juice, please. What would you like? What do you like? Weaver. I'll have the complimentary champagne. Like hell you will. Okay, I'll have a bloody Mary. Weaver. Hold the vodka, the celery and the tabasco. If you wanted a tomato juice, why didn't you just say so? What's your name? Hey! Teri. I'll have whatever you like, Teri. Okay? Apple juice. That would be great. Thank you. Make that two. Thank you. Coke, please. Okay, and what would you like? I'd like to nail you, baby. That's two strikes, stubbs. One more, and I will gag you. You got a short fuse, marshal. It's gonna be a long flight. Sorry about that, miss. He won't be bothering you again. Sir? Just bring me a coke. Buffalo gals! Huh? That's the song from it's a wonderful life. ¶ Buffalo gals, won't you come out tonight? ¶ Come out tonight come out tonight ¶ that was... that was... That was driving me crazy. I dated a criminal once. Only once? He owned a used car lot. They busted him for turning back the odometers. How could you trust someone like that? I figured I did the same thing when I told him I was 21. Trans con 47, heavy radar contact out at 7,000 cleared to 16,000 feet. Roger, out at 7,000 to 16,000. She is really cute. Yeah, just your type. I know it's meaningless to mention, but a detective planted the evidence that convicted me. You're innocent? Yes, I am. Duly noted. Are you married? Yeah, but I don't wear a ring because I don't like jewelry. You don't have to defend yourself to me. Was that a tough sell to your wife? The "I don't like wearing jewelry" bit? Weaver, I know you'd like to entertain yourself by engaging me in a challenging conversation, but I like to read on a plane. Okay. Duly noted. Hey, Aldo. I watched inside edition last night. How come you wasn't on it? Because I was doing Oprah instead. Ooh, Oprah! Didn't you get the message? What message? Hard copy called. They did? Hines, here. Coffee. Ah great, you read my mind. And served with such style and grace. Well, that's easy after a zillion Miles. Cream and sugar. Skim milk and saccharine. Oh, God. Why do I do this to myself? An old man trying to stay fit in a young world. Hey, you're supposed to stick up for me. I'm just looking at the clouds. We heading into rain? Yeah, three heavies in front of us. Reported serious turbulence. We're changing altitude and course, try to vector around it. May put us 10 minutes behind schedule or so. Better let the crew know. That is an easy order on this flight. Good evening, folks. This is captain Powell. We've had reports of rough air west of our position. We're gonna leave the seat belt sign off for the time being as we try to steer clear of the weather. However, I recommend that while you're in your seats, keep your seatbelts fastened at all times. Yes? I'll have the steak, please. Okay. Me, too. Ten to one, one of them has a heart attack before we land. And what will you have? What do you recommend? The Turkey. Turkey? Okay. If that's what you like, then that's what I'll have. You got it. But I'm a vegetarian. Turkey. - Okay. - I'll have the same. And what would you like, sir? I've got to hit the head. You went before we took off. I gotta go again. Let him go in his pants. Come on, he's a human being. He's not an animal. Turn around. Mind your own business. It's your call, Marty, but I say no. Give the man his dignity. That's not right. Oh, damn! You gonna behave yourself? Well, what am I gonna do with chains on? Marty, don't be soft. Don't tell me what to do, okay? You both go with him and stay with him. Shit. Come on, man. Move it. Here, Billy Bob. Alright. Good decision. Shut up. Oh. You know, I could go too, Marty. Okay, let's get this over with. We'll all go before we eat. Come on. Thank you, but I'm already potty trained. You're going to the bathroom, Ryan. I don't have to go to the bathroom. I'm fine. No, no. We're going, so you're going. This is getting silly. Now, I assure you, when it's time for my bodily functions to kick in, you'll be the second to know. We're disturbing the passengers every time we do this, so we do it now! What passengers? I'm not gonna tell you again, now let's go! Okay. That was the captain's seatbelt warning. You will all have to go back to your seats. Uh, we're not done here, ma'am. Well, from what I can see, nobody has to do anything. Now, the seatbelt light is on, and you all have to sit down. Okay, you heard the lady. Let's go. Let's go. Okay, come on, we gotta get back to our seats. Be right out. Come on. I'm washing my hands. This is captain Powell. We can expect a rough ride for the next 15 minutes. We turned on the seatbelt sign, so please return to your seats and fasten your seatbelts. What are you doing? Hillbilly Bob. Ah! Sir, you're going to have to take your seats now. Arquette, what's going on? Let's zip it up! Al! What is it, Marty? Stay where you are, Mike. What was that? Everybody down! Down! Weaver, don't get any ideas. I wouldn't think of it. The seatbelt sign is still on. Let him go! Back off! Back off! Now, you do what I tell you or I'll kill him. You do and you're a dead man. I'm a dead man already. Let him go! Marty... I'm sorry. This is really touching. You boys wanna hug each other? - Boo! - Oh! Now, let's get it. Better check it out. Get back! Oh, my God! Bastard! Cleveland, this is trans con 47 heavy. We are declaring an emergency. Losing cabin pressure, we'd like to descend immediately. Stand back! Stand back! Jet crossing traffic directly below you. Maintain your altitude. Flight attendant to flight deck. Flight attendant to flight deck, please! Verify your cabin pressure, if possible. Autopilot flight selected. - Autopilot disengage. - Autopilot disengage. - Cabin pressure. - Cabin pressure. Trans con 47, this is Cleveland, state your altitude. - Autopilot engage. - Autopilot engage. Trans con 47, how do you read? Watch it! Easy! Stay where you are... Oh, God! No! Drop that gun! No, marshal Dillon, you throw down your gun. Now you drop it, or I'll do her. Stubbs let her go. Weaver, you stay out of this! Let her go! Why? 'Cause she give you a fuckin' apple juice? Look, stubbs, you put a bullet through her head, by the time it comes out the other side, you're gonna have five in you. Is she okay? You alright? Bullshit! He won't shoot. He goes to the pistol range five times a month and practices on cardboard versions of you just for the hell of it. Look at his face. He wants to take you out, stubbs. Let her go, stubbs. We need a hostage. Wake up, stubbs. We have a dozen hostages already. We already have the upper hand. Don't do anything stupid and give it back. Take it easy. Got it? Give me your gun. Fuck you. Get him to drop his. Look, stubbs may be a moron, but he's a professional. He's not gonna let her go until you're disarmed. I'm not giving you my gun. Why not? I already have one. I didn't see the need to wave it around like an idiot. We seem to have a surplus of idiots on board already. You okay? You sure? You lost, Douglas. I'll take that, cowboy. See, I am a professional. Stubbs, listen to me... You're not so tough now, are you? Look at me when I'm talking to you. Stubbs... Okay. Let's have us a little skydiving exhibition. Stubbs, what are you doing? This motherfucker's getting out! You can't open the door during the... Shut up, Weaver! Don't touch that door! Sit down sugar. Okay, asshole, open the door. Open it and say Geronimo! Well, all right, you can say crazy horse. Just open the fucking door! No, she's telling you the truth! One, two, three! Shit! Carl, get in... Betty, follow me. We have to notify the pilot. Teri, get a pulse. Maggie, he's still breathing. Okay. He's alive. Betty, get a blanket. Bleeding to stop. We've got to get this open. What's the procedure here? The co-pilot would make an emergency landing. I'll go to the flight deck. You stay here and... I'll go. Pressure. Pressure. Wait a minute, you can't go. You're not in charge. Look, the most important thing you can do right now is save this man's life. You're trained for this, I'm not. Here, use this, now we've gotta work together. Carl, go with him. Give me the keys to the cockpit. Come on. Here you go, Maggie. It's fine. Could you help me with my wife? Please? Please? It's weak, but it's still going. Betty, get some water, please. We may need some more blankets. - American national 890, - Cleveland center, we've lost radio control with trans con 47. He's at your five o'clock, 15 Miles, opposite direction, 2,00 above you. Could you please relay to him to contact indy center now, on 128.3? He's in distress. American national 890. Roger, Cleveland. That's indy center on 128.3. Cleveland center, American national 890. No reply from trans con 47. Do you have another frequency you want us to try him on? Negative, American national 890. Thanks for your help. Cleveland, this is trans con 47 heavy. We are declaring an emergency. Losing cabin pressure, would like to descend immediately. Okay, we've lost all communications with trans con 47. The plane took a steep dive right after this recording, and it's since leveled off, and seems to be steady. And it's off the airway, and... They've got major storm activity ahead. We've identified its location on the map, and the scanners are indicating it's on autopilot. If it continues on its present heading. All right. Notify the faa and get me the uh... FBI. ...Fbi. Marcy, priority call. Go and check. Okay. How is he? Oh, God. This is bad. What did Ted say? He bumped his head pretty bad, but he's okay. He's got clearance, and we'll be on the ground in about 15-20 minutes. Jesus, God. What's the matter? Nothing. Are you all right? Yeah, I'm fine. It's a wonderful life. When we land, what happens then? I'll be transferred back to death row. And I'll wait in my little cell, until however long it takes. Have you ever been married, Teri? Teri? I was engaged. Was engaged? He broke it off. I always wanted to be married. Have a family... a kid. I always wanted a son. I don't know why I always do this to myself. Did you do what they say you did? No. No. I never killed anyone. Because what you did up here, is save lives. You saved my life. That's not going to mean anything down there. In fact, they're going to think I orchestrated the whole thing. It is gonna matter. You don't know the guy that framed me, Teri. Who's that? They give you a last meal. But you know what? I'm gonna ask them for a last song. Maybe if I keep a beat in my head, it will distract me when they strap me in, stick the needle in my arm and watch me die. We're not descending. Maybe he hasn't found a good spot yet. I'm gonna go up and check. I'll be back down. Okay. Trans con 47... Los Angeles. Do you copy? Please respond... Ted? Trans con 47, do you read? Please acknowledge on emergency frequency 133.75. I repeat, 133.75. Trans con 47 heavy, from company cmc, we're assuming lost communication. If you read, squack ident... Shit. 7-700. Repeat, 7-700. Trans con 47, this is the trans con crisis center... Once again... Trans con 47... Trans con 47 from cmc, we've lost communication... squack ident to transporter code 7-700. We show you tracking jet 146 out of... level 350, and we're protecting the airspace ahead. Ted? We're still not receiving your transmissions. Trans con four... ¶ deck the halls with boughs of holly... ¶ ...fa LA LA LA LA LA... ¶ ...Please respond... Trans con 47, if you read, acknowledge on emergency frequency 133.75. I repeat, 133.75. Trans con 47, if you copy, please acknowledge. Bingo! Someone just flashed his ident. Okay, trans con 47. We got you, we copy your ident. Please contact on emergency frequency 133.75. I repeat, 133.75. Brooks, what's the status on those two prisoners? Trans con 47, if you can hear me, squawk ident. Trans con 47, if you can hear me, squawk ident. I thought we had confirmation of a gunshot slaying. Are you positive? I saw it clear as day. Someone had to have hit that switch. Maybe it wasn't one of the pilots. Maybe someone hit it and didn't know what they were doing. What do you mean, not one of the pilots? Who the hell is flying the goddamn plane? Well, right now the plane is on autopilot. So just leave this to us. Maybe they're trying to communicate with us. Maybe they can hear the broadcast and haven't figured out how to work the transmitter to respond. We need an instructor pilot in type. Okay, I need a 74720 right now! Less than 500 Miles radius from that trans con. Tower air, 91, cmc, captain bowen, you are now linked for relay on 133.75. We'll by standing by. Trans con 47, this is tower 91 on trans con crisis request. If anyone can hear me, press the ident button on the far right of the center console. Repeat, find the ident button on the center console. Far right side about halfway up and press it. Trans con 47, we've got you. We copy your ident. Well done, tower 91. Roger, cmc. Good show, trans con 47. Now we're going to find the vhf-tuning panel on the middle left side of the center console. It has two small frequency windows marked "active" and "standby." The active frequency should read, 133.75 in green numbers. About four inches below that is a small switch marked r-stroke t-int. That's your transmit switch. Now, whoever you are, position your boom Mike in front of your mouth. When I tell you, push the r/t switch forward, keep it there and say your name, then let go of that switch to listen. Do it now. My name is Teri. Teri halloran. Very pleased to meet you, Teri. Captain Samuel bowen here. Now, remember, when you need to say something push the rt switch up, hold it there, talk, then release it. You got that? Got it. Trans con 47, this is Rachel taper from the trans con crisis management center. Are you a passenger or a... I'm a flight attendant based out of New York. My employee number is 1-0... We don't need that right now, miss halloran. What is the status of your flight crew? Dead. Both are dead. One of the prisoners escaped, there was a shootout. All the marshals are dead. It's a mess. What do I do? Teri, this is Frank sinclair, FBI. Who is actually flying the aircraft? Nobody. I'm up here all alone. Where is the rest of the cabin crew? Down below with the other prisoner. Ryan Weaver. Oh, my God. Try and keep her calm. Is this plane going to crash? No, you are not gonna crash. How do you know? Because we're monitoring your flight systems on the central maintenance computer. Yeah, but aren't we heading into a storm? Don't we have to land this plane right now? Teri, you've got to stay calm. The most important thing for you to do right now is to just stay calm. Okay... I'm calm. Now what? Whatever you do, don't touch the autopilot switch. I won't. Now the good news is that you are flying the most sophisticated plane that has ever been built. Great. But what if this sophisticated plane flies into an unsophisticated storm? I hear you, Teri, but this plane has a great track record. Patch me through on a call to the department of defense. Teri, we need you to stay calm. Yeah, calm. That's me. Hey Aldo, I gotta ask you a question. Go ahead. Internal affairs has been asking everybody whether we think you planted the evidence. What did you tell 'em? Well, I said no. Fuck no. I'd never tell 'em anything. We're partners. But I'm just curious. Did you plant the Teddy bear in Weaver's trunk? You're damn right I did. Hey, hines! You got a telephone call! Sure. Right after lunch. This is somebody out at the crisis control center at lax. About Weaver. Holy shit. - Cmc to trans con. - 47 heavy, flight level 350, tracking 245 degrees. Approaching an area of severe weather, enter 12:00, 200 Miles. At her present ground speed, we show her entering the weather boundary in two-three Miles. I'd like you back with the others. We're heading into a storm. And I'd like to hold on to the gun, if you don't mind. You don't like me, do you? We were seated in your section, but you made Teri wait on us. Didn't you? I thought it would take her mind off her problems. What problems? She ended a relationship recently. You're very smart. You didn't lie to me. You could tell I can tell when somebody's lying, can't you, Maggie? Can't you, Maggie? You're sharp. I noticed that. When? When did you notice it? Say it. Don't be afraid. When? Just say it. When... you persuaded the other agents to let the prisoner go to the bathroom. You were hoping something might develop. Come on. Everybody back into the crew bunk, please. What? Everybody back into the crew bunk. Round them up. Let's go. Come on, come on! Let's go! Everybody back into the crew cabin. Let's go. Come on. Come on. Open the door, Maggie. Go open the door. Excuse me. We can't all fit in here! We'll fit! All right. Keep moving. Do something. Yeah, do something. Come on. Carl, do something. You're the man. Tell him. Come on. Look, why don't we... Ahhh! Get up. Up the stairs. Okay! All right. All right. Get up! Move! Give me the key. Those people did nothing to hurt you. Why hurt them? What's your favorite book, Maggie? I read Stephen king. You're alone a lot, aren't you? What does that mean? Men don't look at you anymore. At least the ones that you want. Your plumbing's getting rusty. What do you have to look forward to, Maggie? You might be able to go for it, but then what? Can you kill? I started with squirrels and birds. And then I moved on to cats and girls. If you can kill me, Maggie, go for it. What did you do with Teri? I think it's you that you should be concerned with. Oh, God! No! I don't like you, either, Maggie. You rub me the wrong way. No! Get in! Okay, Teri. We need to get you up to speed on the operation of the autoflight system, specifically how to use the autopilot, before we can begin to discuss your descent. Discuss my what? Teri, this is Rachel taper again. Listen to me carefully. We think that you might be able to land this plane if captain bowen can talk you through it. I'm gonna go downstairs and get the senior flight attendant. Teri, no. Stay where you are. Why? We need you to program the autopilot so we can vector you around the storm front ahead. You've got a level six storm. Is that a six on a scale from one to 10? No, Teri. On a scale of one to six. I'm going downstairs to get Maggie. She can handle this a lot better than me. Teri, no. Stay where you are. Do not leave the flight deck. We have to stay in contact. Okay. I'm hanging. Cmc, Minneapolis center. We show trans con 47 tracking jet airwave 60. She's maintaining her preprogrammed flight path. Yeah, Los Angeles police department, please. Is this an emergency? Yes, ma'am. Rampart division. Lieutenant, I have a call for you. Yeah, I'll take it. Hines. Don't you mean, lieutenant hines? How are you, Aldo? Weaver. What's going on up there? Well, it wasn't a pretty scene. The other prisoner broke chains, killed the four marshals, and I came in and saved the day, and took care of him. Aldo? I heard you. You don't believe me? Where's the pilot? They're dead. Both of them. So, who's in charge up here? Me. LAPD. Come on through, sir. All right, Ryan. You, you, wanna... Whoa, whoa, whoa. Ryan. Now Ryan and not Weaver, huh? Well, that's an improvement, isn't it? You want to negotiate? No, I don't. I'm going to crash the plane. All right, look. If, if you land, we can talk. Listen to me! Both the pilots are dead. There's nobody flying this plane. It's not gonna land. Now, what do you want to talk about? What would you like to talk about, hines? Do you wanna talk about getting me a new trial? Huh? Do you want to talk about you admitting that you planted that evidence on me? Do you wanna talk about that? Maybe you'd like to talk to somebody else. Huh, Aldo? The FBI's here. Fuck the FBI! I'm talking to you. Where are you? Sin, can you get this call on the overhead speaker? Lax. Lax, that's perfect. What, are you the authority on me, now? Huh? Did you tell 'em what I'm gonna do next? Why don't you tell 'em? What are you gonna do? You're not listening to me, hines. You're not fucking listening to me! You don't want to talk to me, that's fine. Why don't you speak to one of the FBI agents... I'm not talking to anybody, because this plane isn't coming down. I'm 35,000 feet in the air with no pilot. And even if I did get down, what would I have to look forward to? Huh? All right, just, just a second... You'd have fucking 20 guns at my head you'd bring me back to prison to await my execution. No. I'm smarter than that, and I'm fucking smarter than you! But we all know that, don't we? We all know that because you couldn't get me without cheating. You fucking cops can't do anything without cheating and without beating. Well, we caught you, didn't we? No, you didn't get me! How did you get me, hines? I'm up here. I'm up here, and you're down there. How did you get me? How did you get me? All right, calm down. No, I'm not gonna calm down! You got me mad now! And I'm gonna go take it out on somebody! And you know what, hines? Her blood is gonna be on your hands. You got that? Do you wanna be famous, Aldo? I'm gonna make you so fucking famous, you make sure you're wearing something bright up on that tarmac, because you're gonna be the first fucking cop to die with a plane up his ass! Ha-ha... Hello, this is trans con 47. What's happening? Are you guys still there? Yeah, Teri, we're here. Just give us a minute, okay? Okay. Fuck! Teri! Teri, open the door. Teri! Open the door! Maggie's hurt, she fell during the turbulence. He's at the flight deck. What? She bashed her head, she's bleeding all over the place, Teri. She keeps calling for ya, she needs you. Teri! Teri, can you hear me? You've got to change your course. We don't care... Teri! He's right outside the door. He says my friend, the flight attendant, is hurt. Teri, if you don't want to come to the door, you gotta give me the first aid kit. It's right next to the bunk. Quick, it's by the bunk! It's your friend, Teri! - Teri, this is hines. - She's calling for you. Lieutenant hines. She needs you. I'm the detective who arrested Weaver. You cannot trust him. Hurry, Teri, hurry! Why didn't you tell me the co-pilot was dead? Oh, he died. You knew he was dead. No, no, I didn't, Teri. He was breathing when I put him into the bunk. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. I did everything I could. This is bad. This is bad. - Whatever you do... - Teri! Do not open the door. Remember when I was trying to tell you downstairs? You asked me what was the, what was the matter? I was trying to find a way to tell you how bad it was, Teri! Oh, God! You told me we were landing. I didn't know what to say to you! Okay, Teri, I didn't know what to say. I'm sorry. I mean, we've, we've been through so much... Teri, you must program the autopilot. I'm sorry, Teri. Teri, I'm sorry I lied to you. Detect the motions of the aircraft. Captain bowen needs to know them to be able to help you. Do you understand? Teri! Maggie's hurt really bad. I'm going to do everything I can. I don't know what to do, though, Teri. Teri! She keeps calling for you. Teri, are you there? She's your friend. All right, let her bleed. He says Maggie's hurt, and it looks bad. Now, I don't care how charming you think he is. He's a killer. But she is my friend. All right, listen. You could both be in danger. Get her to the flight deck, but stay together. Do you understand me? Teri? Teri, are you there? Maggie? Maggie? Oh... Oh! Please stop. Please. Trans con 47, this is... We will continue to monitor. Trans con 47, this is trans con crisis management center. Please respond. This is trans cons crisis management center. Please respond. What's faa procedure in a situation like this? I don't think there's ever been a situation quite like this. It's got enough fuel to carry it well beyond our coastline. If we were handling this, fewer lives would be in jeopardy. Meaning what, lieutenant? Just what I said. Here's who you're dealing with. Male, Caucasian, 35, well-educated. Raised by his aunt who mysteriously disappeared when he was 16. Has raped and strangled five women, escaped while being transferred to San Quentin two years ago, finally recaptured two days ago. Was being transported to California by four of your marshals. We already have a comprehensive interfax profile, thank you. All right, guys. Can we focus on the problem with the plane? We can't just let it crash into downtown Los Angeles. Look, we've got a level six storm ahead. It's a good chance everything else will be a moot point in about eight minutes. Miss. Will this storm delay our flight? Are we going to be a little late to the gate? Ooh. This is really something, isn't it? It doesn't look too good. Where is everybody? What? Where is everybody? You know, I was kind of wondering that myself. I don't know. They just disappeared. It's kind of creepy, isn't it? Why don't you sit down? Why? Why? Or stand if you want. I don't like guns. So, let me ask you something, what's your favorite movie? What's my favorite movie? Yeah, what... Look, don't answer a question with a question, all right? Only stupid people do that, and you're obviously a very bright woman. Now, what's your favorite movie? Gone with the wind. Gone with the wind. What's your favorite book? Is this a test? That's a question with a question, Teri. Come on. I just want to talk with you, okay? Now, what's your favorite book? Gone with the wind. Gone with... so, it's book and movie. Wow, you're a real romantic, huh? A romantic vegetarian who likes apple juice. Did you have pets when you were growing up? You like animals? Yeah, I had a dachshund. Dachshund? You mean one of those hot dog, dogs? Really? Why a dachshund? Because my father liked them, and they were good with kids. Huh... Don't give me an attitude. I'm just talking to you. So just talk to me normal. Okay? Gosh, a guy can't even have a conversation these days. Now, did you like your father? Did you get along with him? Why? Yeah, we got along great. Really? Is he still alive? Are your parents alive? Yeah. Oh, good. Mine aren't. Okay, um, here's a good one. All right. You're... A condemned inmate on death row awaiting your execution. What five albums would you pick? What would you wanna listen to? Or, just pick a song. I don't think I'd be in the mood for music. Well, I don't think you know what the fuck you'd be in the mood for. Would you? No. What would you spend your last moments doing? Uh... I, I... I guess I'd like to see my family and my friends. And what if they couldn't be here? Then I'd wanna make it right with God. What if you didn't believe in God? I do believe in God. You do? Do you believe in capital punishment? What they're gonna do to me? No. No. You wouldn't, though, would ya? What does that mean? It's not who you are. I mean, you're sweet. Dachshunds, gone with the wind. There's always hope, isn't there? What about sex? Huh? Would you wanna have sex on your last day? I'm not going to tell you that, because that's too personal. So is murder. Where's Maggie? Don't get adversarial with me, Teri. You don't wanna do that. Talk to me, Teri. Talk to me. I haven't had many partners. Don't lie to me. How old were you when you first had sex? Eighteen and a half. Did you like it? Yeah. Was that hard? No. No. Just simple little questions. Don't get upset. Everything's fine, okay? Here. Merry Christmas. Okay? Maggie's in the bathroom. She's in the bathroom? Yeah. Maggie's in the bathroom. Maggie? It must be the other one. Hey, come here. ¶ Dashing through the snow ¶ laughing all the way... ¶ ah, ah, ah, no. No, no, no, no! No! Come here! Come here! Teri, come on! Come on! Ahhh! Ahhh! Please hold the oxygen mask firmly against your face. Place the strap around your head. Teri, can you hear me? Is this stuff un-fucking amazing or what? Teri, you are one exciting first date! Are you all right! Teri, Teri, hold on! You're not having much luck with men lately, are you, Teri? Please, I'll do anything you say. I don't want to land. Got it? What about everybody else? I know you've got them somewhere. I don't want to talk about them. I really like you, Teri. Then help me try and land the plane. Listen to me! Listen! Let's enjoy our time together now, okay? Maybe we'll make it halfway to Hawaii before we go down. That would be romantic, wouldn't it? Wouldn't it? No. No, I think that would be a turnoff. Well, I didn't like gone with the wind. It's all subjective. You don't have to force yourself on me. You can have me. If you help me land the plane and let everybody live. So I spare everyone, and you give me a bigger bang than the one I get from crashing the plane, is that it? Yeah. We have a deal? Want me? Come on. You see, right here. This is what it's all about. This is what's it's about, look! It's the thrill of the kill for me. Just like the passengers. I killed them all. Go up to the crew cabin and look. They're all dead. It's a beautiful sight, Teri. Go look. It's time, Teri. Teri, trans con crisis, please respond. Cmc to trans con 47, come in, please. Teri, again. Trans con crisis trying to reach trans con 47. If you read us, please come in. Teri, this is trans con crisis management center, please respond. I'm back! He wants to crash the plane. He wants to go out in a blaze of glory! He's crazy. He killed Maggie! I think he killed everybody. Teri, do you have a weapon? Is there anything on the flight deck you can defend yourself with? No... But he's gonna kill me. That's what he wants. Teri, lock the door. Try and barricade it. Get that fighter airborne now. Yes, sir. We're gonna have to shoot it down over the desert before it reaches Los Angeles. What? You can't shoot a commercial airliner. Did you hear what she just said? He wants to crash the plane into lax. Now, do we have any other option? Teri, our monitoring equipment shows you leaving the west edge of the weather. We can begin to prep you for the approach and descent now. Your controls are going to need your immediate attention and execution. Please, we're all right here. The aircraft is doing fine, and so are you. ¶ buffalo gal, won't you come out tonight? ¶ Come out tonight Are you with me, Teri? ¶ Come out tonight ¶ buffalo gal, won't you come out tonight? ¶ Dance by the light of the moon ¶ Teri! Teri, what's happening? Teri! Okay. Who said this was a non-smoking flight? Ah... Honey! Is everything okay? Honey! Teri! Come out, Teri! Teri halloran, FBI. Are you there? ¶ Buffalo gal, won't you come out tonight? ¶ Come out tonight come out tonight ¶ buffalo gal, won't you come out tonight? ¶ Come out... ¶ come out, Teri! Oh. Oh, my God! She's got a fire. It's on the gaps computer. ¶ Buffalo gal, won't you come out tonight? ¶ Come out tonight come out tonight ¶ Buffalo gal, won't you come out tonight? ¶ Teri, we show you've got a fire on the upper deck. Can you confirm? Come on. Can you confirm the fire? Please respond. Come on. Trans con 47, do you have a fire? Come on. Teri, do you read me? Stay out of the cockpit! You hear me? Come on, get downstairs! Get downstairs! No! Get out of my way! Oh, Douglas' gun. Now, I'm scared. Do you have it in you to kill me? Huh? Don't wound me. Shoot me in the head or the heart! Come on, Teri. Shoot me. Come on, kill me. Come on. Give me the gun! Give me the gun! No, no! This is how you do it. Boom! Boom! Boom! Ahhh! No. Oh, God! God dammit! Boom! Bitch! Now, get downstairs! Get downstairs! Come on. Move, move! Ahhh! Ow! Teri! Oh, you bitch! Cmc, trans con 47, you got to talk to me. Excellent. Captain bowen's down and standing by. All right, Teri, I'm going to turn you over to control, who's gonna patch you through to captain bowen. Keep that f-14 on their tail. Teri! Oh! Oh! Teri! That's it. Oh! I'm never flying this airline again. Captain bowen, you are now uplinked to trans con 47. Go ahead. Teri, are you ready to come down? Absolutely. Okay. We're gonna land using the autopilot, you'll be glad to hear. It's just below the glare shield. It says things like a stroke t, arm, ias stroke mach... Got it. Good. Now, just to the right of your knee, you'll see a small TV screen with buttons on either side. That's the cdu display. We'll use that to input data into the flight computers. What does it say now? 47 progress, and a lot of other stuff. Excellent. We're going to be landing on runway 25 left. 25 left. Got it. Come on! Okay, this is the one good thing you taught me, dad. That fucking bitch! Now press the button marked depart/arrive. It's in the top row of buttons right in the middle, below the screen, and that will give you the arrivals for lax. Okay. Push the button to the right of klax arrival. Now push the button beside 25 left, and then push the button marked "execute." Done. - Very good, Teri. - Very good. Now I'm going to get you lined up for lax. Come on. Come on, son. Come on, son. Oh, oh, yeah. Oh yeah. Come on, come on. I'm a genius! Oh, oh... Come on, genius. Come on! Come on! Ahhh! That's it, that's it. Okay. Oh, my leg! On the left of the cdu screen, do you see a list of words? Yes. Those words are navigation points that define your path to the airport. Now, when you push the top left button... Look, can you talk any faster? Right, right. Push the top left button, then push the button marked "execute." Then the plane will start turning to line up for landing. Done! Tower air from Los Angeles flight tracking, we show her turning left on a preset heading for runway 25 left. Any sign of your friend, Weaver? Not yet. Okay. We're doing splendidly. Time to drop the landing gear. Now, this bit's noisy, okay? Forward center panel, right of center screen, the handle with the small wheel at the end, pull it out towards you and push it down until it locks. How long till we start our descent? You're approaching the marker. We'll begin it now. The autopilots will do the landing all by themselves, but you'll have to set them up. Okay? Okay. Find the switches beneath the glare shield labeled left, center and right and push the two that are not lit. Okay. Hand on the speed brake handle, that's the big chap next to your right knee. Pull it up and back just a hair. You done that? Got it. Teri, right above you, on the overhead panel. See the landing lights? Turn them all on. There's seven minutes to touchdown. Leave her alone, she'll do the rest all by herself. You're just 20 Miles out. Everything's looking rosy. Okay. Okay. Okay. Ah... all right, I need a volunteer for a dangerous mission. You, you, you. Okay, you. Ow! Ow! Whoa, whoa! Okay. You can stay. Sin, did you see that? Yeah, I saw it. Rachel... We believe that Weaver's gained access to the avionics bay. What's the matter? He's in the avionics bay, screwing with the circuitry of the plane. All right, what's the worst that can happen? Disable the autopilot. And then what? Hines. Did you wear something bright? Hold on. You still there? Listen to me. You listen to me. After you got me mad, I went and killed the crew and the passengers. So you better get to confession. The next sound you hear will be me kicking out the autopilot. I'll see you soon! Weaver. Weaver, no! No! Weaver! Autopilot disengaged. Oh, what happened? I'm falling! Help me! Teri, you have to abort. Repeat, abort! Find the two go-around switches on the floor, number two and three thrust levers. - Push them. - Twice. Repeat. Find the two go-around switches on the thrust levers. I can't find them! Yes, you can. She's gonna slam right into the crowne Plaza. And if she clears that, she's gonna hit the parking garage. I got 'em! - I got 'em! - Well done, Teri! Damn it! ¶ 'Tis the season to be jolly ¶ deck the halls with boughs of holly ¶ tra LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA... ¶ oh, my God! Oh, my God! She's cleared the buildings. There's just one problem. I think it's a Ford. Okay, Teri. The autopilot backup circuits should have cycled by now. Re-engage autopilot switches. Autopilot engaged. Okay. Teri! Cmc, flight tracking, she's losing altitude. Three hundred feet and sinking 500. The truck's dragging her down. You're stalling. Teri, reach over to the landing gear and pull it up. No, no! She can't retract the landing gear. There's a fucking truck caught on it. Forget the landing gear Teri. Do not touch the landing gear. Push the thrust levers forward. - Cmc flight tracking, she's. - 300 feet and climbing out. Patch me through to that f-14. Yes, sir. We can bring her back around and try again. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. You've got a 747 beat to hell by level six turbulence, your flight crew is dead, you've got an armed, convicted serial killer loose on board, eight passengers have disappeared, and your stewardess is locked in the goddamn cockpit. Have I left anything out? Don't forget about the truck. What's going on? Shouldn't I turn around? Cmc, flight tracking from moondog, I'm alongside her at 9:00. In tight. Distance, 200 feet. Speed to match. Roger. Hold your position. What's that plane doing out there? It's just there in case you need assistance, Teri. How could it assist me? Just a precaution, Teri. Don't worry about it. Yeah, well, fuck precaution and fuck you! Okay. Okay, first. My God, she's turning it around. How the fuck can she turn it around? She's only a stewardess for God's sake. She's a flight attendant. Cmc, this is moondog. Trans con 4-7 coming left. Moondog maintaining position. Okay, now listen up, everyone. I'm coming back into L.A. with or without you. So you got two choices here. You can either help me land this plane or you can prepare for one major crash. Notify the department of defense. This is it. Yes, sir. Wing commander, this is special agent sinclair. Arm your weapons and prepare to fire. I repeat, arm weapons and prepare to fire. Roger. Breaking left to rejoin. The pilot? The pilot that was outside my flight deck window? I don't know if you can hear me. I think you can. I... I hope you can. If you're supposed to stop this plane. I just hope you'll give me another chance. Target is in sight. Just one more chance to show you that I can get this thing down. Look, I know it's only one life up here against, who knows how many, if we crash. But I can make this happen, if you'd just give me another chance. Weapon systems are armed and ready. Standing by for further instructions. That's all I want for Christmas. It's all I want forever. Cmc from moondog. Reconfirm intent to fire. Now, you listen to me, son. None of us wants to splash that plane. But bringing her back in would be risking thousands of other lives. Now, you fire on that target, that's an order. My commander's gonna have to authorize that, sir. Target's approaching a populated area where debris could hit the ground. That's why it's important that you don't waste time. Fire on the target. Say your prayers. No, no, no! Moondog, this is commander rice. Fire. That's an order. Fire! Come on, asshole, get up! I dare you! Come on! No! No! No! You gotta love her! Oh, God. Ow! Oh, God! Come here, come here. You're not gonna kill me. You can't kill me. 'Cause you don't believe in capital punishment. I changed my mind. Trans con 4-7, your excess baggage has been claimed. You're clear to land. Oh, perfect. Rachel! Yeah, I hear you, Teri. Weaver is dead. Copy that? Yeah, Teri, I hear you. Can captain bowen hear me? - I'm with you, Teri. - Tell me what to do. Find that arrival switch again. Okay. Push it. I pushed it. Now push the button beside runway 7, right, and then execute. Okay, lax arrival's up. What next? Find those switches below the glare shield labeled lnav and vnav. Push them both. Just to the left of those switches is the airspeed control knob. Dial in the speed of 1-8-0. Done. Speed brakes armed. Armed. Reduce speed to 156. 1-5-6. Okay! All right, Teri, you're locked onto the glidescope. The plane should land itself now. Whatever happens don't touch the controls. Got it! Cmc flight tracking, she's intercepted localizer 7 right slowing to 1-6-0 knots. Everything's looking good. Yeah! All right! I'm down! I'm down! Teri... Set the parking brake, please. Merry Christmas, everyone! - Whoo! - Yeah! Red leader to team three, we've located halloran, she may know where the hostages are. We're en route. Miss halloran, I am lieutenant hines. You'd make a hell of a cop. No, thanks. Merry Christmas. You too. Captain bowen. Captain halloran.
