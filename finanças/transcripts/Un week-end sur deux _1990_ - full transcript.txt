Where's my coat? What are we gonna do with her? I don't want to go to the zoo like last time. Vincent. Vincent. Where's Vincent? Why didn't he want to go to the zoo? Are you hiding again? Vincent. Is Daddy taking us? Where are we going to sleep? Mickey Mouse, Mickey Mouse… Remember what she was singing last time? Vincent. Vincent. What are we going to do with her? Don't act like a child, I know you're here. Those expenses add up. Didn't you ask for a carpet for the entrance? Are we out of cookies? Here you go. Your round-trip ticket. I won't go. OK… You get an advance of 7,000 francs for your expenses, minus 1,200 francs on phone calls, the hotel in London from November fourth to November 12, and your bill at the King's Bar. Bali cocktails are pretty expensive. There isn't enough, I need more. Give me that. You won't get a cent more. It's your fault they took my checkbook. Mine? Isn't it your job to manage my accounts? I can't manage them if they're empty. I better go, Carole's picking me up. Finding a cab these days… That clock is broken. It's just like any other job. Nothing dishonorable about it. If you think you're above that, you'd be wrong, Camille. Anyway, the agency is tired of covering your expenses. Carry it with you, otherwise… it'll wrinkle. I didn't sign it, I'm not going. I signed for you. Precisely. What are you looking for? My cigarettes. When it suits you, you don't mind at all, huh? The guarantee for the bank, you were OK with that. What's this? Whose is it? Put it back where you found it. - Under the bed, then. - Yeah. Don't forget to change your voicemail and to leave the key to the concierge. And smile. You're pretty when you smile. I won't go. I don't want to go. You agreed to. I don't want to go anymore. We've discussed this. Come on. Come here, Vincent. Please give this to her. Good evening. Good evening. Vichy, this is Vichy. Can you give me your hand? Connection for Nîmes. Next stop for Lyon, Clermont-Ferrand, connections for Périgueux and Brive-la-Gaillarde. - Did you see her? - Yes, of course! …is arriving at the station. Miss Valmont. Raoul Jacquet, vice-president of the Rotary Club, my wife, Graziella, and our treasurer, Mister Lombard. We're honored to have you. Welcome to Vichy. Ah, yes, let's take a picture. Gaëlle! I didn't mean to do that. May I help you? - Are these your kids? - Yes. You were told, right? I mean… Not really, no. - What about your doll? - I left it in the train. Look, we asked you to book a room for one. I know, but… can't you see there are three of them? We need a suite. The suites aren't ready, sir. We need to charge extra. We can work it out. We'll find a way. Take something else out of her per diem. Talk to the manager. The gala will be held at the ballroom, I think it will be splendid. After the show, we're having a reception at the city hall, a very private affair. The mayor would be very pleased to see you there. Sure, with pleasure. - Come on, young man. - Pavillon Sévigné… It officially opens tomorrow, madam. Please call us back later. - Lombard! - Mister Jacquet? Ah. The keys and the papers for the car we put at your disposal during your stay here. I'm friends with the Hertz dealer. He'll be here tomorrow evening. You can thank him yourself. The manager is here, for the suite. My friend owns a perfumery in town and she would love to have a signed picture of you to put it in her window display. It would be good publicity for you. You were so good in that series you were in. Miss Valmont. You can have your afternoon. - Are you her son? - Yes. I wasn't told she'd have her kids in tow. Marie-Pierre, can you open room 40 for me? A book of tickets, please. A book or a membership card? - A book. - A book. What's a book of tickets? - Will I be able to come back? - Yes. - You can come back until… - Until Sunday. Hello. You wrote that you've learned how to swim. Show me. Do what I do. The breaststroke. Do the breaststroke, it might be easier. Come on. Let's go. If you want to enjoy the hammam, it's downstairs. Charles! We're closing, the schools are coming in! Vincent? Vincent? Vincent? Vincent? What are you doing? Are you OK? Are you coming? Yes, yes, I'm coming. Hurry up! Chop-chop! - And this one? - A dog. Why didn't you go to America with us? You couldn't come? Look at this one. What is it? A pigeon. At San Sun Beach, Auntie Jane had three dogs. Vincent always says he wants to go back. And this one? A rabbit. No, it's a hare. And now he lost an ear, it was blown off by a hunter. Which one do I sleep in? It's up to you. Good night. Good night, Vincent. Shit. I would like a Bali cocktail. The musicians are just rehearsing. OK, let's do it again! Please! Didn't we meet last winter at a recording studio? Perhaps. You were there to record a demo. So, what does your daddy do? He's in the import-export business with Eastern Europe. Oh, this one needs watering. We said 20,000. - They need… - No, my bad. 15,000. That's the deal we had with your agent. How many are there? But you must have a copy of the contract. We can surely come to an arrangement. Could you do a personalized announcement for each one of our sponsors… Manziano's auto-repair shop has been very generous… Or perhaps you could draw… the winning raffle tickets. I already declined. The raffle is being taken care of by my wife. Much to her delight, by the way. Miss Valmont! It's working now. For Manziano's repair shop, do we have a deal? You'll have memorized it by this evening. We are delighted to have you tonight for the opening of the splendidly-renovated Pavillon Sévigné. It was… Vichy's Rotary Club… I'm delighted to be here with you to launch this humanitarian campaign… To launch this humanitarian campaign… An initiative from your friends in the city… How will you be dressed this evening? - Sheath dress. - Me too. - I already wore it last year. - I want to thank the Cambos… - but with the creases… - I want to thank the Cambos. A big round of applause. Now I have a secret for you… Now I have a secret for you… The winner… Where will he come from? We need to test the lights. Please, Miss Valmont, can you come here? - Hello. - Hello. With my father. What are you doing here? I'm in charge of the actress's kids. Left, left. No, your left, not ours. Aren't you supposed to be following me? What about your mom? Does she live with you? Shut your mouth. Where is she off to? We're not done yet! Come back! It's sweet of you to come and visit. Vincent didn't want to come. Lights. On me, on me. Can I borrow it? Can I pet it? Why he is spreading his wings? To find his balance on your hand. It tickles. Don't touch that! You're gonna catch a cold. You're not having dinner? I can't right now. It's about to be at its brightest. - What? - A double star. Gamma, the brightest star in the Draco constellation. I need to adjust my telescope. Don't you want to come with me? You could watch the magician from the wings. All around this overhang, the sea stretches to the horizon… Come on. One last spoonful. For Daddy or for Nanny? It's up to you. Come in. Excuse me… You'll be up soon, miss. I asked for tartlets. Spurting water, white water, fresh and sparkling water from Auvergne's rich soil… The philosopher Gaston Bachelard deciphered the… There's a phone call for her! But also… buried water… Did someone ask for me? Yes. We insist. Take it in the phone booth. We, the people from the West who've been spoiled by History, know our… privilege… - Hello? - It's me. I can't hear you very well. What's with the big party in Vichy? A charity gala dinner. Listen to me carefully. You can chase after all the pathetic gig fees you want, and go wherever your sorcerer tells you to go but don't get the kids involved in that clown show. - You didn't even tell me! - I didn't… One weekend with them and you can't even look after them and spend time with them. You never found time for anyone! Anyone! I don't have to give you my schedule. Until six o'clock tomorrow, I get to do whatever I want. It's Mommy time! I don't want to talk to you. Get them ready. I'm coming over to pick them up. It's better if we don't cross paths. Where are you? First and foremost, I'll let you discover our surprise guest for yourselves. You know her, you've admired her… I'm calling over a lovely and very graceful young lady… Camille Valmont! I'm very happy to be with you this evening. This adventure that's only just starting, you're the ones who make it possible. Your donations will allow technicians from our region… From your region! Allow tech… Excuse me. Your donations will allow technicians from your region to travel to Africa to undertake drilling and irrigation works that will improve the locals' lives. I especially want to thank our main sponsors, the Bertrand drilling company located on route de la Croix Nivelle… Bédouin Transportation… - Bégouin! - Bégouin, for blazing new trails, and Manziano's repair shop. The raffle winners will be picked by Mrs. Jacquet. And now, it's time for the Cambos. See you soon. - Where's Vincent? - Next door, we had an argument. We're leaving. - Is the show over? - No… Yes! Get ready. Help Gaëlle get dressed. Why are we hiding? What about the book of tickets for the pool? They're good until Sunday. Gaëlle! Call her room! Her room! Don't yell at me. Let's move on to the raffle! We forgot our swimsuits. Naturally, you have no clue where she went. - Do you have hot chocolate? - Yes. - What's in the… - Breakfast. Can you give me a hand, Vincent? Do you want to play with me later on? I want to finish this before the wave comes. First of all, there's no such wave. That wave isn't even real! Feel warmer now? - Let's go for a run, shall we? - Yes. Do it again! Again! Again! Again! Ever since Nerfetiti Whoever said "All that glitters is not gold?" They are wrong, I'm telling you They are wrong Whoever buys me, I reject Everything's for sale I'm selling everything for cheap -I'm selling everything for cheap -Come on! ENTRANCE You can keep it. - Stay right there! - Are you out of your mind! Do you think that's funny? Whoever said "All that glitters is not gold?" Vincent? It's the mistral wind. - They are wrong. - It gets on everybody's nerves. Those little ants are following their daddy. Ants don't have a daddy. No daddy? There's a queen, and that's it. Remember the house we stayed at for the summer in Cassis? No. Come on… There was a patio. You rode your trike there when you were little. You remember, don't you, Vincent? So how are they born? From eggs. Yeah! You weren't there the day I was born, it was Nanny. Why weren't you there? Can you please sign this? My buddies recognized you. Thanks. What's your name? A little girl named Gaëlle, wearing a pink skirt and a yellow coat is lost! Her mom or dad can pick her up now. Somebody, at least! Whoever said "All that glitters is not gold?" Come on, I was nearby, I thought you were playing with your friends. I found her near the snack bar. - She told me her car had left. - Why are you soaked? - Thank you! - She's a sweetie, and I don't even like kids that much. And you! Buy them or get out of here! No touching! I'm selling everything for cheap Stop! Ouch! Wanna play leapfrog? Do you know how to play leapfrog? Go. Have you seen a little girl? Come on! - This way, this way! - What are you doing? Let them. Stop! Stop! She's my mom! Do it. You're not gonna chicken out, are you? That hurt! I just talked to your father. We'll see him on Tuesday in Perpignan for lunch. He'll take you back to Paris. You'll be in school on Wednesday. There's no school on Wednesday. Yes. I meant Thursday. Are you coming this evening? - Why are you leaving, Camille? - Did you see that? A shooting star. Quick, make a wish. What's a wish? When you see a shooting star, you close your eyes like this, and you think really hard about what you want and it'll come true. What's your wish? Ah, that's a secret. If I say it out loud, it won't work. Wishes are dumb. She must've caught a cold, but she has no fever. When did she get her last jab? When she was two years old. Yes, but, since then? Did she get the measles shot? Any illnesses recently? Chickenpox, I think. She got chickenpox in January. We both got our measles shot. She had her adenoids removed when we were in America. Are you the mom? Yes. Who's responsible for them? Me. Try the late-night pharmacy. That'll be 250 francs. OUR GALAXY ACCORDING TO ESTIMATIONS, THERE ARE 100 BILLION GALAXIES… EARTH'S ORBIT-SOLAR ECLIPSE I'M HERE Gaëlle, we need to go now. No, I want to see Nanny. You'll call her this evening. No! I want to see Nanny. Hello? Yes? How many guinea pigs are there? Seven, seven babies. Who would you rather be with? With her and with Vincent. And where are you? Where is that? At the hotel. Where is the hotel located? By the sea. But where, by the sea? - What's it called? - I don't know. Where are we? I can't hear anything. Daddy has a car like that one. Isn't that right, Vincent? Daddy has a car like that one. Why Perpignan? Huh, Vincent? Vincent! Vincent! Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Earth. Vincent! Mercury. Pluto. Uranus. On the night of April 21st, Earth will cross paths with this. It's a trail of asteroids from the Draco constellation. When they enter our atmosphere, the rocks ignite and become meteors. Meteor showers can only be observed on rare occasions. Americans have seen them in Palo Alto. The Japanese too, back in April 1956. And this is the year we can observe them. When is April 21st? The day after tomorrow. That's when it will happen. The meteor shower. But it's impossible to find out where. Where what? Where they'll fall. SHOP Excuse me, is this the road to Perpignan? Vincent! We bought you a rock! Last time it happened was on April 21st, 1956. That day, meteor showers were observed in Denver, Colorado, Hokkaido, Japan. And Erevan, Armenia Any showers nearby? I don't know. In any case, we can't really predict their location. Yes, you can. It's always over deserts, plateaux, isolated mountaintops. That's where you can observe them, where nights are darkest. You need to be patient. Sleep, the boat Top on the boat Top on, top on Sleep the boat Top on the boat Do you want a biscuit? Vehicle registration, please. I didn't do anything. You failed to stop at a stop sign. We got a radio call. Wait here. Stay with us. Vichy's office reported you. For being half-a-day late? - I'll rent another one. - Where will you drop it off? Perpignan. Your payment method? Check or credit card? Cash. Then I'll need 2,000 francs as a deposit plus 850 francs for the rental. Is that the car from Vichy? - Yes, madam is renting a new car. - Cancel it for now. We received a telex about you. Please wait here for a moment. Your address and phone in Montpellier, please? I'm just passing through. No address. There is indeed a minor issue. Nothing to do with us, of course. I got a call from Paris. Apparently, the weather's terrible. They're going to call you back. From Paris? Yes. Shouldn't they be in school? No. Hello, Camille. I'm glad we can talk, we were getting a bit concerned. We've avoided legal proceedings so far, but this is a serious matter. - Listen to me. - Yes? In Montpellier, there's a Sofitel hotel. Yes. You're going to go there, get a room and wait. Yes. I think Adrian will pick up the kids himself. Hello? Yes. Let me talk to the manager again. I'll put the kid's mattress here. No, closer to the bed. Can I have a bottle of water? Yes, downstairs. But the tap water's fine. - We don't have any sheets. - I'll ask them. This place is ugly. No, it's not ugly. Why didn't we take the car? I ran out of money. I left more than 2,000 francs at the dealership. It was your deposit, you should've got it back! Stop overthinking it, that's nonsense. I owed them that money. How are we going to get to Perpignan? To Perpignan? - By train. - Will Daddy be in Perpignan? Do we have enough money for the fare? Sure, we do. Where's my bag? Vincent, help me out, you haven't seen my bag? Excuse me, I must've forgotten my bag here earlier. Did you find it? No… What does the bag look like? It's a brown leather bag with a handle. It's got to be here. I didn't see it. Are you sure you didn't leave it in the coach? No way! Excuse me, have you seen a brown bag? - No, ma'am. - But, it was right here! It was right here five minutes ago! This is unbelievable! Someone must've taken it, with so many people coming through! Why do you have to make a scene everywhere you go? Look, Vincent, maybe I'm not the mom you wanted. I'm a mom who loses her bag and lies when she's confused This is who I am! If I embarrass you, do without me! - Dibs on the big bed! Dibs on the big bed! - Stop! - Dibs on the big bed! - Stop! Stop! Aren't you taking your bag? My son says you're an actress, is that true? Is she leaving? And why didn't she like her? Maybe Snow White wasn't that nice. She wanted to look pretty, she wanted everybody to like her. When the guard left, she was alone in the forest. She was lost. The night was very dark, she was very scared. And all of a sudden, she looked up and she saw… - The dwarves. - No. A star. It was really bright. It left a light trail in its wake, as if it were showing her the way. So she followed the star and was able to get out of the forest. The star was still there, but it had stopped moving. It was becoming bigger and bigger, brighter and brighter. It was a supernova. Denver, Hokkaido, Erevan. Spain. During the nights of April 20th to 22nd. Will you be in Paris as well? I don't know. Where would we have gone to watch them? South. On an elevated plateau with perfect visibility. Go to sleep. Go to sleep. I'll show you tomorrow on the map. Where is Daddy waiting for us? In a house? Maybe he brought the guinea pigs. Are you ready to order yet? - Are you expecting someone? - Yes. Ladies and gentlemen, I hope you are pleased. Very much, Albert, as always. - We haven't seen André today. - No, it's his day off. Goodbye, ladies, goodbye, sir. Goodbye. You're going to make a mess. - May I leave now, Mister Albert? - Yes, yes. Maybe he was held up. No. He wasn't held up. He won't come. I made it all up. And why did you do that? I really wanted to hang out with you. You had no right. You know, Vincent… when you left for America, I came to pick you up on a Wednesday afternoon. I rang the doorbell, the concierge broke the news to me. But this isn't the reason I did it. I'll bring you back to Paris. It hurts, -Come back, please, the girl cut herself! It hurts! It hurts! Excuse me… We're going to leave after all. How much do I owe you? Nothing, madam, the Coke and the napkin are on the house. This way, madam, this way, please. - Thanks. - You're welcome. What else do you have? The train for Paris-Austerlitz will arrive on platform one… - Stay away from the edge of the platform. - We're leaving. I kept one. That's my mom over there. All right, now go back to your seat. Hokkaido, Erevan, Spain. Piedras Caldas. It's right here. The plateau's highest point. Is it far away? No. A couple of hours' drive. What a mess! Don't pay attention to it. Had I known you were coming, I would've fixed you a tasty snack to celebrate. I rarely get to see you guys. Is he all right? And… You… Don't you want something else? Are you sure? Whiskey? Yes. He's doing OK now. He's at peace. Good thing my father found him that job. When he came back from Paris, he didn't know anyone here. He never should've gone there. That was my idea. I wanted him to get his degree. Yes, but it wasn't for his sake. He took up bouldering again. Did he tell you that? He never calls. Mireille! Check it out! Check it out! There she is. My sister-in-law. The actress. That's his car, he hasn't even finished paying for it. He won't let anybody touch it. Not even me! Anne-Marie? What's the matter? Come here! Here we go! Did you see this? They're doing high-tech pedagogical experiences. We're now connected to the regional education authority. Your mom and I wanted to see the Amazon. We wanted to travel upriver all the way to Manaus. It was the city of the big rubber boom in the early 20th century. We even applied to a crew exchange program, all because a girl we barely knew sent us a postcard from Brazil. You didn't go? No, she dumped me. That was the year she left town to conquer Paris. Being alone in the Amazon jungle… I never would've recognized you. Last time I saw you in Paris, you were a foot shorter. Don't you think he looks like me? You got the Fante eyes. Stéphane. Before you leave, take the car out of the garage. And just to let you know, all the doors are still open upstairs. Here you go. You can buy one of those… sticky hand toys. - Did you notice anything about Marie-Ange? - What? She's pregnant. You didn't notice anything? You could've replied to her cards. You're not trying very hard, are you? What are you doing on the road? I heard you took up bouldering again. Beach tournament final, Collioure, 1976. Competitor number four, Miss Anne-Marie Fante. Get in position! Alley-oop. Stéphane? Dammit, this thing never works. Stéphane, it's Marie-Ange! Yes? Is your sister still around? You can't let her leave. We got a call from a lawyer in Paris. The kids… She abducted them. You look stunning. So you came back for no reason at all? Nice one, Stéphane! Where are we going, Vincent? To Spain. Is that far? Behind the mountains. Will Daddy know where we are? Stop! Thanks. I want to see it! Show it to me! Show it to me! Show it to me! Show it to me! Show it to me! We can cross the border here. That way, we'll be on the road that leads to the mountains. We'll need gear, sleeping bags, if we'll be sleeping under the stars. Piedras Caldas… Right here. It's not indicated on my maps. - How far are we from the border? - 50 kilometers. Well, let's pass by... Let's go there. Stop! I come through here a dozen times per year! Jewelry! Papers, please. What else do you expect to find? - Are they your kids? - Yes. Do you have your family register? No, I don't. Do you have the boy's ID? I forgot it. Well, it's EEC policy. Kids aren't allowed to cross. I'll go and check. Please call your mutt back… I come through here a dozen times per year! Calm down, calm down! Come. Call Tonino! Joseph, Joseph! Call Tonino! Her! I know her! She knows what I sell! Ask her! Hey, you, princess! - Do you know her? - No. She knows what I sell! OK, here, go on, keep moving. Off you go! Hey, you! CUSTOMS I know that woman! Another beer, and another side of calamari. - And another one for the kid? - Yes. You'll see, it's really tasty. Stop it, Gaëlle! You're going to drop it. This is precision equipment. Precision? Far from it. It's not the most expensive lens but it's decent for watching the sky. That's what the salesman said. He didn't know squat. I hope the kid's OK. What's wrong, Vincent? I saw you. This is junk, second-rate, it's made of plastic! - Two sides of calamari. - Thanks I hate Spanish people. Why is that? I'm tired of being here. I want to go home. Didn't we agree on this? I'll be expelled from school, and it'll be your fault! I've already missed three days! That's what you wanted, it was your idea… We're almost there now. You're lying again. You knew very well it was impossible. Even Grandma calls you a black sheep! I don't care what she says. You're in no position to lecture me. Why? Because you left us. You left us. Stop this thing! You always draw attention to yourself, I hate you! No! Well, gentlemen… Vincent! Vincent! Miss, miss! The bill! Vincent! Come! He's wearing… a pair of brown corduroy pants, shoes with laces… With laces. And a shirt. What color is the shirt? Grey. Where were you? I went for a walk. - What did you do? - Nothing. But we could've lost you… Weren't you afraid? No. What if we'd never found you? I would've managed. How would I have managed without you? Can I go in front? I think we need to leave the freeway soon. Have a look. I'll be going to that mountain too. Right, Mom? I want to go there too. Yes, you too. See, Vincent? I'm also going to that mountain. Why won't you answer me? Don't you want to sleep with me? In your bed? Don't you want to have a look? No, it's cloudy this evening. Tomorrow evening, we'll be leaving around midnight. At one point, we'll leave the car and continue on foot. After we've crossed the stream. If we get cold while we're stargazing, we have blankets. Especially for Gaëlle, if she falls asleep. We won't necessarily see anything the first time. You'll help me. Good night, Vincent. Why don't we all live together? Vincent? Nanny, nanny! Oh! Down you go! And around you go! Daddy! Daddy! On the road, I met a guy who didn't look very happy. He told me to bring you this. Vincent, can you come here? This is for you. This is for the little girl. What's her name again? Gaëlle? This is for her. - Can you go and give it to her? - Yes. Aren't you going to open it? Thanks. The state of the roads in these parts! This morning, a herd of sheep suddenly decided to block my way. They were coming from everywhere and just stopped moving. I got out of the car, made my way through… the sheep, I hid behind a rock and I started bleating. Baa! Baa! Eventually, one of them started moving, and he was coming my way. But you know how sheep are. - Very dumb. - Yes. Sheep are dumb. - And all the other sheep followed it. - I know. So we were able to drive away. Take your bag. You guys aren't done traveling. We haven't reached our destination. I booked a stay in Séville. We'll spend eight days there. If you don't like it, we'll go further south. No, I'm not coming. Can I use your shower? What are you gonna do now? I'll probably stay here for a while. Or keep moving. I don't know. It's funny, during those five days, I was afraid at first, and then I realized it was an opportunity. - For whom? - For us. For us. I didn't do this for us. Don't be mad at Vincent. Kids need order in their lives. Good for you. My own patience was growing thin. I don't get it. Is it over? Yes. Say it again. It's over. Kiss me. Vincent? Vincent! Hurry up, miss. Vincent! Goodbye, Mommy. Vincent? Vincent! Goodbye. Goodbye. Subtitle translation by: Thomas Isackson
