Gorky Film Studio for Children and Youth Films. Screenplay by Viktor SHKLOVSKY. There was a man. He wasn't very happy. He was a big man, smart and strong. At first he was young. And in his youth, he had some misfortunes. Later on, he had more luck; he had some victories. He started to rise. To rise in his own way. Then, he called another man and said: "We've had victories but science hasn't been formulated yet. We have an empire, but we don't know where its frontiers are. We know the Asian continent. But we don't know if it is near America. Go and check". The other man was also not young. He wasn't old either, in our opinion. He was an ordinary man. He said: " I will". They gathered some young seamen and convict workers, and left. They went through the biggest country in the world, which had no roads. They took with them ropes, anchors and sails. They arrived at an unknown sea. The local inhabitants called it " Lama", which in their language simply meant " sea". They arrived onto the American shores and they established the boundaries of our northern frontier. They left a remembrance of themselves in the name of our great country. Every man, from the highest ranks to the lowest, who comes to serve in our fleet, must beforehand duly take an oath of his loyalty. Peter I Naval Charter. I, Dmitry Ovtsyn, swear to God Almighty to serve loyally. His Majesty Peter the Great, Emperor and Tsar of Russia. And everywhere and in any situation I shall guard and protect the interests of His Majesty and of His Nation. I shall notify him of anything adverse I hear, and I shall avert all that is harmful, and I shall do all that is in favour of His Majesty and His Nation, in good and Christian conscience, without deceits or ruse, as is required of a good, honest and loyal man. As one must answer for on Judgement Day. In this may God Almighty help me. He who takes a mendacious oath will be punished with the slashing of his nostrils and he will be condemned to the galleys for life. Peter I Naval Charter. Mitya. Hail, Prince lvan. His Majesty's illness is becoming worse and worse. He said himself that by his look one can understand how a mortal man is like a weak animal. I'm in a rush. I have to take care of some state affairs. You must not be late, Mitya. The Emperor calls for your masters' committee. Fyodor Matveyevich. My bad state of health forces me to stay home and to assign to other people important matters which are now too arduous for me. I have now recalled what I had been compelled to forget because of numerous other concerns. Abraham Petrovich. Bring the maps. You, Bering... You have been to India. You know the naval service. We need to trace a reliable route to our lands, to China, and to India. And this route will go across our Arctic sea. It is a great pursuit. But if such is your command, then firstly we must trace on the map the coast of the Arctic sea. You, Bering, will do it. As you please, Your Majesty. You will do it as you want. Try. You are a zealous man, Bering. You must do as I ask. Who made this map? Midshipman Ovtsyn. He's here, Your Majesty. Interesting. Skilful. Although you should not have drawn all these whales. A whale shouldn't be on a map. It swims away. So, midshipman Ovtsyn. You will go to the Arctic sea to draw a map and to check how your whales are swimming around. I will, Your Majesty! I will go by ship. You're smart. Who's your instructor? Of late it's been lieutenant Chirikov. So, do you have students? Do you beat them often? According to the law, Your Majesty, twice a week. But Dmitry Ovtsyn remembers his lessons very well. With a whip, he will remember them even better. - Isn't it so, midshipman? - Of course, Your Majesty. Abraham Petrovich, present him with my drafting set. Chirikov, before departure, gather a dozen fine young men like Ovtsyn from the Naval Academy. They will also travel to the Arctic Sea. And you, Bering, when you come back, you will speak of what you've seen. I hope I'll live to see that day. Your Majesty, your days will be long. But deep concerns and afflictions have wearied you now. Take these maps now and go. It's so difficult. I'm lying here and I don't know where the end of my own land is. Katya! Katya! It's so difficult. I can see the end of my life. I will send a letter with every dispatch. You will receive a letter four times a year. I understand now that we will never return to Horsens. Well. Once more, I will be waiting for you. Why did you ask to be sent to such an exile? In my heart, I will be here, close to you. Well, then, Mitya, I'm going. Take your time. Don't overindulge. Study. The Arctic Ocean will teach you what you don't already know. God be with you. Go! Peter. Forgive me, Peter. - You? - Me. You? Spare Aleksashka's life. Forgive the swindler. Paper! I will write his pardon! Give him everything. Everything. The Emperor has died. Everybody! Come here! The emperor is dead! What is this? What are we seeing? Who are we losing? What are we going to do? We are going to bury Peter the Great. Russia will continue to be as he has made it. He has made it the beloved country of good people. And it will continue to be beloved. He has made it frightful for its enemies. And it will continue to be frightful. He has made it glorious for the whole world! And it will continue to be glorious. And it won't cease to be glorious! Things that were unheard-of in this century have been accomplished in you, Russia. Construction, navigation, a new fleet! The whole universe is amazed. All paths to every end of the world are open to you. And your strength and glory extend to the ocean! A great man had disappeared. It seemed that everything had stopped, that everything would collapse. People sent by Peter the Great were travelling to determine the frontiers of Russia. Ahead were Tver, Kazan, the Urals, and Siberia. In the taiga, they chose the trees that would be the milestones and the masts. People would come to an unknown sea, to burning mountains, whose history would then begin. THE BALLAD OF BERING AND HIS FRIENDS Written by losif OSIPOV Viktor SHKLOVSKY. In cooperation with Yuri SHVYRYOV. Vitus Bering - Karl SEBRIS Dmitry Ovtsyn - Igor LEDOGOROV. Alexei Chirikov - Yuri NAZAROV Georg Steller - Valentin NIKULIN. Starodubtsev - G. FROLOV Tishin - L. KURAVLYOV Anna - V. ARTMANE. Lieutenant Ovtsyn. An urgent letter has arrived from Saint Petersburg. Peter I - R. TKACHUK Catherine I - D. RITENBERGS Anna loannovna - N. MORDYUKOVA Dear Sirs, Her Majesty the Empress Ekaterina Alexeyevna died peacefully on May the 6th. Princess Dolgorukova - V. YEGORENKOVA Prince Dolgorukov - O. BASSILASVHILI. With cries ofjoy and with the jubilation of the people, Pyotr Alexeyevich, nephew of Peter the Great, came to the throne of Russia. Hurrah! Emperors and empresses changed. Plans and decisions changed. In Saint Petersburg sovereigns changed and people were bustling. There was neither room nor time for the expedition dispatched by Peter the Great. The ships were sailing. They went through a channel that is now called the Bering Strait. And there, Commodore Bering saw ice floating towards him. It was moved by currents and winds from an unknown sea. Bering was dismayed by the ice and said: " We must go back". And they went back. But the American land was only 40 versts away, hidden by the mist. They sailed past the burning mountains of Kamchatka and arrived at the frozen coast of the Sea of Okhotsk. Lift up the stretchers, put them in front. Captain-Lieutenant Chirikov will lead the crew in a prayer to give thanks. They prayed to God, as Columbus' and Magellan's men did. It is a very old nautical tradition. Ahead was Siberia, the Urals, Kazan, Tver, and Saint Petersburg. Their expedition was successful, but it was recorded as a failure and they were told: "Go and do everything anew". So they had to repeat the feat. And it would take them 20 years. We need to go to the east, Commodore. I am sure that is where America is. Alexei llyich. America... Lord, there is only ice to be seen. A peaceful and prosperous life, health and redemption, triumphs in all that is good, and abundance of yields, oh Lord, give to the pious Emperor. Pyotr Alexeyevich. Tell them, Anna has come to the throne, Anna loannovna. Yes, I will tell them. Anna loannovna has come to the throne. Anna. Oh Lord, give a long life to the pious Empress Anna loannovna. Prince lvan Alexandrovich? How did you end up here? Jumping around until I jumped into trouble. I was an officer, an engineer, and then I was sent to Siberia. Now I serve the Empress as the main imperial courtjester. I've heard about you. But with your rank and title, how can you have become a jester? There is nothing offensive about it. Prince Bolkonsky is a jester, Apraksin is a jester. And there are vacancies. What are these? Whales. Of course. Whales give blubber. We need whale oil for lamps. We can sell it. We will make leather. But why is there so much water, such big oceans? For trade and glory, Your Majesty. Without water, there is no trade. What is your request? Our sailcloth is worn-out. Do you need a large length? Five thousand arshins. Herzog, do we have sailcloth? Yes. - Give him some. - We have sold it. To England, to Holland, to Sweden, and to France. They're all at war now. They all need sails. Fools. They should use galleys. Galleys have wooden oars worked by convicts. It's good profit. Listen, whose name is it, here on the map? Dmitry Ovtsyn. From the Ryurik family? Yes. Did you see him at the Dolgorukovs' Yes. He's confrontational. It would be better if he weren't alive. Bering, lvan lvanovich, where do you have him work? In the Arctic Ocean. On the Ob coast. Would it be possible to send him off a bit further out? Further there is nothing but ice. Mind now, Chirikov, that this Ovtsyn not work for you. Yes, Your Majesty. Well, Sirs, you may go. Herzog will write the paper and I will sign. Your Majesty, the document is ready. We need the sailcloth by tomorrow. I have sold it. I pay wages with pelts. But for sailcloth, I receive gold. You're a sailor. You don't know trade. Then sail. Russian people are brave. Now! Play something for our captains. Yes, Your Majesty. You can try to make complaints. It is not without reason that the empress remembered Ovtsyn. Mitya is thinking whether or not it is worth going to Beryozovo. Katya, the princess, whom I loved when I was a child. Katya, the former fiancee of Emperor Peter II, is now a prisoner. Katya is in Beryozovo. That same Beryozovo where Prince Menshikov died and was frozen like a mammoth. How could I not stop? Am I a coward? Or am I an officer? So he went! The prison. I didn't think that I would see you again. I thought about you all this time. Take this for good luck, Mitya. Now you will always be with me. Hello, Father. Hello, Major Petrov! And hello to you, Oska. Don't call me Oska, I am an official of the 13th rank. I am neither defamed nor under surveillance. Osip Mikhailovich Tishin, the departmental secretary. - Lieutenant Ovtsyn. - Major Petrov, governor. What is your news? Our news is nautical. We carried out a triangulation. We tried to go through the Aniansky channel. The Father says that there can't be any channel between Asia and America. It is obvious from the Bible. Which means there is none. Because it cannot be. How so? Vitus Bering saw it himself. He wasn't sent in vain, was he? Bering was mistaken. Such a channel cannot exist, therefore there can never be one. Even though the Father is in exile, he studied in Kiev, and not only Magnitsky's arithmetic. The channel cannot be, because man descends from Adam. In America there are people, and they could get there only by dry land and not through some channel which Bering did not go through. There's a mountain chain and it's impossible to go around it. Talking of the Aniansky channel is blasphemy and a detraction of faith. The emperor wanted to show this to the whole world and sent you fools. Well, we cannot say this. We will talk after a clarification from the Senate and the Synod. Young people, excuse me, I have a service tomorrow. It's late. Don't take offence. We're just having an informal conversation. Well, I'm going home. I'm going as well. After all, the ship has arrived, and documents need to be written. What's wrong? Nothing, Vanya. It's just that my stomach... aches. Has a midwife been called? I'll go. Lieutenant, you didn't offer your hand. I am the departmental secretary, On par with a lieutenant, according to the ranking chart. I see. I know that, although Ovtsyns aren't princes, they are Ryurikovs. Whereas I am a departmental secretary. But according to the chart, you have to offer me your hand because I am a noble. Ovtsyn navigates the sea, and you, Sir Tishin, bother Princess Ekaterina with ribaldry. And what if I offered her my hand and heart? You should consider who you are and who she is! She's a prisoner, though she receives a rouble a day for her living. And I have a 13th class rank. Another rebellious brood is being born. We must resign ourselves. If the fiancee of the Emperor had become Tishin's wife, it would be clear to all that the Dolgorukovs resigned themselves. And instead you worry about pride and channels. It's worthless. Listen, Tishin. The Dolgorukovs have many relatives. Don't mock the lady and don't frighten the prince. She is a prisoner, I supervise her. You're a scoundrel. You are a scoundrel and a rebel against God and the Sovereign. Why have you come to the house of betrayers? Everyone is a Dolgorukov here. So are you! Treacherous words! Loyalty to the Sovereign! Loyalty! Loyalty! Under the decree of the Empress Anna loannovna for those exiled in Beryozovo; Ekaterina, daughter of Dolgorukov, is to be sent to a monastery as it is wont. Prince lvan Alexeyev, son of Dolgorukov, as well as lieutenant Ovtsyn, are to be sent to Tobolsk and kept under the strictest guard. Hand it in. Our horses are out, Sir Chirikov, and there are no men available. And the document hasn't been compiled according to procedure. The name of the Empress is missing; it is not depicted in the signature. Which means that yours is not a matter of emergency. The document comes from the Senate. And you will give us horses. As for men, convicts will work for the naval service. And you will also hand over to us. Dmitry Ovtsyn. And for the trouble we will be... particularly grateful. There is a particular and extremely strict decree which forbids, and makes it a criminal act, to cast on the floor money with the effigy of our August Sovereign, lest they be trampled on by an impudent foot. Pick up the sacred visage of her Majesty the Empress! - How was it lying? - Face up. Tishin, did you do it for the purpose of stomping on them? Call the guard! This is betrayal! Osip Mikhailovich confessed. - To everything. - Hush! Scoundrel! Get out! Get out! Quiet, quiet, quiet! So, officer, am I really some rude fellow? I was just fanning myself. I didn't say I would not carry out your request. And apart from me, who else could hand Mitya over to you? You will give us horses. Make sure they're well fed. And some men from among the prisoners. Mitya Ovtsyn is a rogue and a scoundrel. On the rack, he was defiant. He's a qualified man and he's needed for government affairs. And the prisoners are intended for the expedition. Your fur coat is very fine. Well, if you want, we can exchange my sable for Ovtsyn. I've heard that Commodore Bering is exerting himself to release Ovtsyn. He will probably be set free. And you will be left with somebody else's ring. How so? Well, you'll have to give the ring to me. For the sable. Alexei llyich, how did you manage to set me free? With their own methods, I forced them to be loyal. Well, that, and I paid a ransom. Oh, and let me help you marry your poor unfortunate. What happened, Dmitry Leontyevich? We were arrested because of Tishin's slander. Major Petrov, the governor, and me. Prince lvan was chained to the wall and tortured. And under torture, he told such terrible things. His wife gave birth very unhappily. Major Petrov was beheaded. How about you? I stood my ground through several tortures and fire. I don't know what happened to Prince lvan. He was quartered. His body was put on a wheel. What about Ekaterina Alexeyevna? She's in the Voskresensky monastery, near Novgorod. Get some sleep, Mitya. More difficulties are waiting ahead. People kept going, according to Peter's will. The polar region was awoken from Archangelsk to Kolyma. Twelve fleet lieutenants followed rivers flowing north. And Dmitry Ovtsyn, a lieutenant in Peter's fleet and now a seaman, was among them. Here a port is being built. It will be named only when the ships are launched, Bering's and Chirikov's "Saint Peter" and " Saint Paul". Petropavlovsk! This is Steller. There is no record of his appearance. He called himself an adventurer, but he was a hero. He arrived in Russia when he was 25 years old. He was taught Russian by coachmen and convict-sailors. He wrote a book about Bering's expedition. He wrote and spoke truthfully about his new homeland. He was often arrested and often released. He died at 37 years, charged with protecting Kamchadals. What's there? - Am I speaking with Mister Bering? - Yes. Georg Steller, graduate in natural history. I am a botanist. For some reason I was sent to your expedition as a physician. Well, we need a ship's doctor. But I am not a doctor. I am a botanist. In any case the order is correct, and with all due respect, you will be our doctor. But if you reach and go through America, and have no scientist, then you will be like a needle without a thread. You will pierce the cloth but you will not sew it together. You will see nothing. You are not very polite to your superior. Commodore, maybe I should go and advise about the kind of wood we need in order to make good tar? I believe that is more important than politeness now. - Was he rude? - What? Was he rude? Was he offensive? - Who are you? - Savva Starodubtsev. It is me who provided you with a detachment of 20 carts and that Lutheran. Who is he? A German, a Swede, a Dutch? Who knows? He's a foreigner. From Yakutsk, nobody wanted to bring him here; they were angry with him. But God made me travel a lot and I was held captive. I taught him to drink vodka. I caught a rat for him, an ermine. It lives in his mitten. He became attached to me. He says I'm like a father to him. - He wrote an ode to me. - An ode? Fine. I'm like a father to him, he wrote a poem... Whatever... But here's what. If it wasn't for me, you wouldn't have those 20 carts. And I've also brought you a letter from Tobolsk. The messenger died on the way. Dear Sir and father Vitus lvanovich... Commodore, you're travelling to the edges of the world. Take me on. I don't want to go back. Why is that? I am wanted because of some matter of faith. Go to the quartermaster Savva, say I gave the order. It would be good if you could go on the flagship, Mitya. And why not with you? The Commodore will be able to protect you better. Mitya. The Commodore doesn't object to you being with us. Good luck. Let's go. In front of you is Delisle's map. This map is confidential and only now can you become acquainted with it. One of the members of our expedition is Delisle's brother; the astronomy professor Louis de la Croyere. Now some words from him. Everybody understands that firstly we need to head to the land which was once viewed by Juan de Gama. Having talked with my brother, I think there are many treasures there. The route is... South-east by east to 47 degrees of northern latitude. - There is no land there. - I know. Do you remember how we talked with Ovtsyn? Why are you just telling me? It will be useful to everybody to hear his opinion. Dear officers, please listen to Dmitry Ovtsyn's opinion. He's new with us. Today he's a sailor. But he used to be a cartographer serving Peter the Great's purposes. I hope, dear Sirs, that you will cooperate as best you can in order for Ovtsyn to be able to make his return among the officers of the Russian fleet. Speak, Dmitry. Mitya, careful. Dear Sirs. We need to think about our original plan. That land is just a fruit of imagination. Just as the questionable seafarer who allegedly discovered it. Professor, why did you nonetheless include this land on the map? This land doesn't need corroboration. It exists. There is evidence. Which evidence? Excuse me. What do you mean to say? I think that, in order to carry out the instructions of the Senate, it makes more sense to travel to America now and check this land on the way back. It seems that now sailors are allowed to dispute the opinion of the famous Delisle and the instructions of the Senate? Excuse me, Sirs. This is not the way to conduct scientific debates, Professor. Excuse me, who invited you here, Mister Steller? I am no seaman, however you could have invited me as a man of science. I am leaving. I am leaving. But remember this, Professor. In my field, we never make a record of a plant unless we have seen it with our own eyes. So you worked under the command of Peter the Great? It is a very good reference. You know, I would like to offer you something. Where did you study? At the Naval Academy. And you? I... I... I am an adventurer. I came to Russia not long ago to look for fortune. I learnt Russian with Feofan Prokopovich. - I worked for him as a doctor. - That's a good reference, too. Well, we'll be good friends. Where is that from? At the end of May 1 741 all the necessary arrangements for the expedition in America were ready. The " Saint Peter" and " Saint Paul" were able to leave the harbour and wait for a favourable wind in the roadstead of the Avachinsk bay. I was on the " Saint Peter". Its captain was Bering. It had a crew of 76 people; sailors, soldiers and interpreters. The other ship, the " Saint Paul", had an equal crew, and its captain was Chirikov. Lift the capstan! Ten, five sazhens! Clear the anchor! Fix the anchor to the ship. Lubbers, to your places! Take the helm. Keep it steady. On June the 6th at 9 o'clock, we finally set off on ourjourney. With propitious wind and good weather we left the Avachinsk bay and set out for the open sea. On June the 1 1th we already were at a distance of 150 Dutch miles from Avacha. Tell captain Chirikov to advance ahead of us. Yes, Sir Commodore. Launch the signal! Dmitry. I've just opened a letter. It says that I have to keep you under strict control. - Where is the letter from? - It's from Tobolsk. I am compelled to take on board a man who will ensure that everything takes place according to regulations. He will carry out the duties of a prison keeper. We should have departed earlier. Will they put me in chains? No. We must use you for the hardestjobs. I wanted to make you my adjutant. Well, go downstairs. Fire the cannon. Cannon, fire! Yesterday I verified the calculations! Since yesterday we've been travelling on De Gama's territory! There is no land! What should we do, Commodore? Continue on the same course! On June the 12th, in spite of all my reasons to maintain the course, the Captain made a turn to the North. That's when misfortune occurred. As a result of foggy and cloudy weather, we lost sight of the " Saint Paul" and were not able to find it again for the rest of the journey. Where the hell are you going? Furl the sail! Sir Commodore! Sir Commodore! - It's a catastrophe! - What? Kozyrev fell in the sea. Turchaninov abandoned the watch unauthorised. He left Ovtsyn alone on the sail yard, and Ovtsyn was hit by the sail. - What? Is Ovtsyn dead? - Thank God, he's alive. - Where is the deserter? - On the orlop deck. Bering is a state criminal! There! The cross! You shouldn't use such terms, deserter. lf, God forbid, Bering is slandered, you won't avoid my judgment! I am bound to condemn you, because I've seen people like you. Call the prison keeper. Take him to the officers' cabin. Pipe all hands on deck! You will be kept in chains until we return. Then I will send you to Saint-Petersburg. What are you doing here? Go back to the cabin. Sir Commodore, a current from the east has brought a herald to our ship from the American continent. Autumn will begin before we reach America. I grieve that we are alone now. Land! Land, land! Hey, get up! Land! Dear friends, land! There are no such mountains in Siberia or in Kamchatka. Maybe this mountain is being seen by navigators for the first time. This is America! Long live Commodore Bering! It's noon! Fire! 15-20. 15-22. Take the compass bearing. Captain Commodore. I've heard that you... have forbidden anybody to set foot on shore. I fear that you might delay us. The weather is still favourable... Any kind of weather suits me. Rain, a storm! Thunder! Even death suits me. I must go see this land, do you hear me, Captain? And spend there as much time as I need. I will publicly protest against you in the Senate! You betray the interests of the country you serve! You have the coarse soul of a mercenary! Put down your sword. There is truth in your words. And you will set foot on the shore. Don't stay too long. I can't see you well, Steller. Commodore, you're ill. It's scurvy. Work, and remember that I am not a priest who can forgive your and my sins. And take away your sword. Accompanied by only a Cossack, I got to the island and immediately directed my steps towards the far inland. After one verst, I came across traces of human beings. After 6 versts, I found myself at the foot of a cliff. I could go no further. The time spent in the exploration was inversely proportional to the time spent preparing for it. Preparations had lasted for ten years and the actual event only lasted for ten hours. A snowstorm rushed past. With God's help, we sailed where the angry sky was sending us. Half our crew was lying powerless. They prayed fervently. But the curses that had cumulated in the 10 years of our stay in Siberia deprived them of the possibility to be heard. Meanwhile, many in the crew were dying of scurvy. So fast, and in such great numbers, that we barely had enough strength to direct the ship or to change the sails. I am not overstating the gravity of the situation. The most eloquent pen could not describe our distress. Blissful assumption and eternal rest grant unto them, O Lord. To the departing souls of your slaves. They shall be justified in everlasting memory. It's me, sir. I've brought you a light and something to eat. Where are we? God knows. Why are they singing as if the Judgment Day had come? The drummer Osip Chintsov, the naval grenadier lvan Davydov and Father Illarion have died. The naval secretary is now our priest as well. Explain what happened on watch. Land! It's Kamchatka! My brothers, it's Kamchatka! Land! You can't go! It's madness! People with scurvy can't go out! Fresh air is like death to them! The sick can't go out! You will die! Congratulations, Dmitry! God sees everything. Our agonies have come to an end. Sir. Excuse me. Forgive me, Sir Commodore, but there is news! News, Sirs! Sirs. 55, 56 degrees of northern latitude. That is much further north than the Avachinsk bay. Is that so, Sir Ovtsyn? Precisely, Sir. Though I didn't do the calculations. The midshipman did them. - When did you do them? - At noon. The sun came out, but only for a moment. I did them very rapidly. Can we count on the precision of these calculations? Sir Ovtsyn taught me how to calculate fast. What's your opinion, Ovtsyn? Sirs, this is not a continent. It's an island. It may be very large, but it is an island. We need to move south, sail around the island, and then go west, to Kamchatka. I am certain that land is nearby. In 3 days all our crew will be dead. It's not enough that so many died! How is it possible to believe the calculations of a young midshipman! If only everybody followed the Emperor's charter as he does! When you're on watch, I always see a record saying that we can't determine our position because the sun is not out. And I saw such records even when the sun was out! Open the door. Drop the anchor. Help me, Sirs, help me see the land. Good. You took the straps on shore. We'll have something to live on. It's good not to torment people. God, look how he's fattened up. So, convict, speak. Why did you accuse an innocent man? Or I'll just leave you here forever! Come on, Savva, are you the secret police? What do you think, adjunct, is this Kamchatka? Well, there are a lot of sea animals, so food is not a problem. However, Sir Commodore, if we take into account all the facts, then, I think, this is an uninhabited island. It is not Kamchatka. It's too late to save the ship. Let's go. So, secret police, have you found out the reasons for the accusation? You scoundrel, I know you. You're a bloodsucker. He just wanted to escape hard work. He knew he would end up with me. And he was afraid to climb on the mast. If it had broken, he would have fallen into the sea. The man almost lost his mind. So, Feodor, you're loyal after all? Good. You serve His Majesty well. Only, you will have nobody to accuse in court. I'm dying. But when I die, you must tell people the truth. Do you promise? Unchain him. I revoke my order. An animal! A sea animal! Meat! What did you bring, Savvushka? I've cooked a seal. It's a bit fatty, but it's all right. The sailors are eating. - Steller has brought some herbs. - What kind of herbs? Curative. I chewed some myself. You see? There is no blood on my teeth. So, Savvushka, what's going on? Dear Commodore, I must tell you about my own guilt and my crime. What guilt, what crime? Who could you possibly offend here? I improperly ordered, without your permission, to have the ship taken apart and have a new one built. You're a fool, Savvushka. You'll never make a good " Man Friday". The ship is state-owned. We can't touch it. - Have me carried outside. - You can't go outside. Do it. Let me look at the world. God bless you! God bless you, dear friends! What did you say? The soil growled? It roared in horror. It's a volcanic land. So, well, I made a decision according to my foolish mind and without permission. You can cut off my head or throw me into the water. We had saws. We removed the masts. And in your name, I ordered to saw the masts into planks and to make a boat out of them. How did you dare? I had to because people are dying. Nobody wants to perish. Have you ever built a ship before? I have built huts. And I've seen how ships are built. Savva, how could you destroy a sovereign's ship against the law? It was terrifying. In your name, Mitya collected signatures. Everybody was scared. I know I'm guilty; we shouldn't have done it. But people... they look at the sea, they cry, they die, they're burying each other. I told them: Vitus lvanovich was a simple sailor himself. He used to climb up the masts, to weave ropes. - I did. - That's what I told them. Vitus lvanovich is a sailor and he sailed the whole world. I ordered to build. I commanded. - Did you think of this yourself? - I did. You're lying! Yes, I am. Ovtsyn told me to. Gather everybody. I will thank and give my blessing to the new ship and to Mitya! Dear shipmates, sailors, officers, and former subordinates. Adversity had made us equals. I order you to leave me buried in this earth that has covered me. It's warm. I choose this grave myself. Write this order. At the end, add that the responsibility for the order is mine, because I've discovered this island, which means that I rule over it. I will sign it. Shipmates, and you, officers, go and ensure your daily nutrition. And you, Steller, come here and open the Bible to the book of Job. Read to me. Even though perhaps I won't hear it to the end. Although affliction cometh not forth of the dust neither doth trouble spring out of the ground. Read about the sparks. Yet man is born unto trouble, as the sparks fly upward. Goodbye, Steller. You're a good botanist and a good friend. Dmitry. Have you marked out our island onto the map? I did, Commodore. The sun is good today. Preserve this map. And this as well. Goodbye, Dmitry. I want to... tell you... my last will. You haven't forgotten how to speak Danish, have you? Yet man is born unto trouble... Yet man is born unto trouble, as the sparks fly upward. Before the Commodore's death, Steller read to him from the Bible. With these words your father died on the island. I had never seen such a young commodore. Were you with him for a long time, Mitya? For a year, until he died. Did he die in your arms? - Was he buried without a coffin? - No. We found some planks. He had made them himself. As he was dying, he cried. He thanked you and asked you to forgive him. "Tell her to let my children become seamen for the Russian flag. Tell her to take them to Chirikov. They will learn naval skills. If he comes back. If he doesn't then find another vessel of mercy". I knew that you wouldn't come to me with good words. It's what he said. Mitya, do you remember what this room was like 20 years ago? We would drink wine, and dance. There were young officers. Cheluskin danced here. A beautiful person. And the brothers Laptev used to come here with their wives. So handsome! Pronchishev danced here. Sometimes even Vitus danced with an axe. He showed us how they used to dance on the shores of the West Indies. To Madagascar! Where are they now, all these men? Their names are on maps. Cheluskin. The most northerly cape. But he is dead. Pronchishev died. He was buried with his wife. There's a bay named after them. The brothers Laptev have perished. During the wintering. And Bering? Commodore Vitus... Now a sea, a strait, and islands are named after him. Islands... After the storm separated us, Chirikov went his own way. He reached America two days before us. He sailed past our island but didn't notice us. Did you receive the drafting set that the emperor had offered you? I had no time to. It's a pity. Go to the cabinet of curiosities where the emperor's belongings are. Bow in his memory. Do you recognise her? She was the fiancee of the emperor and your friend. She was an exile in Beryozovo, and then went to a monastery. Now she's the wife of General Bruce. This is my friend Dmitry Ovtsyn. He's returned from a great expedition on the American shores to trace the northern sea borders onto our maps. I've heard about you from my wife. You acted with childish intemperance and with knightly straightforwardness. And although it is not appropriate to act like that, and I myself don't act like that, I respect you. Your lmperial Majesty, allow me to introduce to you. Lieutenant Dmitry Leontyevich Ovtsyn who led his crew back from the islands now called Komondorski. Oh, now your cheek is disfigured. So, what do you request, Ovtsyn? Your Majesty, allow me to request to withdraw the fine on the Bering family. What was it for? - For handing out fells to the crew. - Wilfully. Your Majesty, he did it in the utmost distress. Are the islands rich? There live countless seals, beavers, and fish. - What about arable farming? - There is no wheat. There is no wheat. And what do you request for yourself? To serve, Your Majesty. Very well said. Stand up. - Were you tortured? - I was, Your Majesty. Documents about your case have been lying on my table for a year. But my life is so difficult; I have so much to do! Consider your seniority valid from the moment Bering delivered it. And take care of Bering's fine in my name. And now go. Dance! You're not on your islands. Mitka! Alexei! I'm late again. Go. Go to him. I will wait. I, Dmitry Ovtsyn, swear to God Almighty to serve loyally. His Majesty Peter the Great, Emperor and Tsar of Russia. And everywhere and in any situation I shall guard and protect the interests of His Majesty and of His Nation. And I shall do all that is in favour of His Majesty and His Nation in good and Christian conscience without deceit or ruse, as it is required of a good, honest, and loyal man. As one must answer for on Judgement Day. As one must answer for on Judgement Day. Directed by Yuri SHVYRYOV. Cinematography by Konstantin ARUTYUNOV. Art Directors A. DIKHTYAR, A. TALANTSEV.
