A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES Wow, Sinan, this place is incredible. - Oh, my gosh, is this your grandpa? - Yeah, his dead grandpa. [chuckles] Okay, then, Işık. You're the love expert. What do you got? I mean, love isn't all that complicated, really. All of us were born to fall in love. That's the shittiest philosophy I've ever heard. Can we just let her talk? I'm sorry. Please, go on. Well, just think of a movie you've seen. Love is that first moment. When two souls become one, and they fall into each other's arms, certain they were meant to be together. [sighs] So fucking boring. But love isn't boring at all. It's everything. It isn't just this stupid, childish thing you think it is. - Come on, we don't think that. - I do. - [sighs] If you're not gonna take this... - Okay, sit down. We hear you. All right, you need to hurry up and give us details. What do we do now? - We make it perfect. - Hm? Their first night together. We make things as romantic as possible. Like something out of a movie. Then I guarantee they'll fall in love. Just like that. I love it. Go ahead, tell me more. What does it look like? Candlelit dinner, pretty music, breathtaking view of the city. That's it. And you think that's all gonna happen over one meal? Look. Here's a candle and food. Are we in love now? I think we need to find something bolder. I'm thinking something that makes you feel alive, something exciting. That's a brilliant idea. - Sex can be exciting. - Mm. Sex is the simplest thing in the world. We just get them drunk, and they won't be able to keep their hands off each other. - All we have to do is set the vibe. - Make sure they're feeling groovy. Hey, hey, guys. All of this is just... This isn't love. Sex isn't the same thing. Seriously, love equals sex. Always. I mean, if two people screw and it's good, who can say they're not really in love? It's the fastest way to get them together. We need a place with atmosphere, tons of fun, alcohol... - Rock concert! - No! - I like it. - But rock music? Ms. Distas doesn't... She... This won't work for her. It's crazy! Let us handle that. [rousing rock music playing] Hold up, look! If you make a wish when the towers of the Ortaköy Mosque line up, it comes true. Do it again! There it is! I saw it! What'd you wish for? [screams] Istanbul, you're mine! ["Should I Stay or Should I Go" by The Clash playing] - Good morning, sir. Are you... - Don't talk to me. Excuse me. - Excuse me! - What do you want? I happen to be one of the vice principals here, and... Excuse me, sir. I don't approve of your behavior just now. An educator should know better. I'm not an educator, so who cares? Ah. Why don't you introduce yourself to the faculty, Kemal. Think I'll pass. Is he serious? Can you believe this guy? [clicks tongue] You have to admit he's cute. Well, that's your opinion. [scoffs] Found a band for Mr. Altuna. He's a big fan of them. - Make sure you get there early. - Wow. - Not gonna ask how you found out. - Now we gotta convince Ms. Distas. - I'm gonna go take a nap. - Seriously? Forget him. Bring that poem you wrote. Come on. - Işık, can I take this inside... - Actually, if it's okay with you... I was kind of hoping to hear your thoughts right away. Okay. - Is that him? - Yeah, he'll do. Do you think you can handle it? Just go ahead. Burak. Can I talk to you for a second alone? - Eda? Yeah, of course. - Okay, then I guess, uh... I'm gonna head out. Let's go. See you later. [Burak] Yeah, all right. - Um, do you wanna talk here? - Yes, right here. In front of everyone. I mean, it's just that... if I can't hide my feelings from myself anymore, why should I keep them secret from anybody else? [chuckles] No way, you can't be... You have to be fucking with me or something, right? Are you kidding me, Burak? I'm putting myself out there just by coming to you like this. - Maybe I'm making a big mistake. - Hold on, I take it back. Please... I'm listening. I've actually been feeling this way for a long time. Burak, I don't know how to say this... I mean... Your style... the way you do your hair... I think I really might... Get your fucking hands off my girl! [grunts] Boys, stop it! Stop it right now! Break it up! What's wrong with you? Break it up! You think you can take my girl? I'll kill you, motherfucker! [sobbing] What am I going to do? Kerem is going to kill him. He's going to get in so much trouble. I heard him say, "We'll settle this at the concert." What concert? What are you talking about? This concert. Everyone's gonna be there when it happens. [sobs] - Take a... - I'm so scared. Take a deep breath. Be sensible. You're safe here. What am I going to do? - Ms. Distas? - Huh? Do you think maybe you could come with us? Just to make sure everyone stays safe. They won't try anything if you're there. You separated them right away today. I'm sorry, Eda, but I don't know if that's such a good idea. Please, Ms. Distas. It would really mean a lot. Do it for me? [vocalizing] Oh, yeah! Dude, you beat the shit out of Burak. Had to make it real. [Osman] It's Mr. Altuna's turn. Let's make sure he gets his ticket. You won't be able to do it. But why not? It's insane to base this plan on what we think this guy will do because we don't know jack shit about him or how he's going to react. - This plan's fucked. - Like you have a better one? Well, if you ask me, I think they make a really nice couple because Mr. Altuna seems like a wonderful person. [knock at door] Yeah? Good afternoon, sir. My name is Kerem Öz. You're the guy they kicked off the team. I had a disciplinary problem, - but I was hoping that maybe you could... - Not my problem. I'm sorry? Your discipline problems aren't my concern. Get out of my gym. ["Should I Stay or Should I Go" by The Clash playing] ♪ Darling, you got to let me know ♪ He's a piece of shit. ♪ Should I stay or should I go? ♪ - Fuck! - ♪ If you say that you are mine ♪ Looks like it's my turn. - ♪ I'll be here 'til the end of time ♪ - Sloppy dribbling. - ♪ So you got to let me know... ♪ - Hustle! How are you doing today, sir? Could I perhaps interest you... Stop talking. And? We're screwed. What are we going to do? - Işık, come on. - You need me? Huh? What am I supposed to do? Sinan? Sinan! Hello, sir. I'm the student representative. - Congrats. Leave me alone. - This will only take a second. We're organizing an event for new teachers. It's a chance to meet everyone, to play some games... you know, just really bond. It's on April 17th. I think it'll be amazing! What do you say? I got plans that day. Oh, but it would be so nice if you were there. My apologies. [table banging] 17 APRIL How much for a ticket? Uh, it's 12.50. Told you I was busy. Looks like we're all set. [giggles] Do you think he'll really go to the concert? He doesn't give enough of a shit to lie about it. Since he likes the band, he'll stick around for a few drinks. - See you tomorrow, everyone. - Good-bye, Ms. Distas. [exhales] [gasps] Oh, my gosh, the birds! It's gonna happen, I'm sure it will! - What do birds mean? - Lovers attract birds! It's a good omen. [groans] "In the forest of the heart, a bird shrieks, warning us to run the other way, but love might catch us. When passion grows strong, only doves survive the storm. But I am not a dove. And neither are you." That was incredible. You ready? Let's bounce. [rousing rock music playing] [Işık] Sorry, guys but I can't go to the concert tonight. - [Osman] Why? - I'm not allowed. My mom says "things happen" at concerts. What kind of things? - You know, bad things. - Can you give me an example? The kind of stuff you guys do all the time. And what exactly do we do? [Işık] You know, girls with boys, smoking, drinking... - [Sinan] Who told you that? - [Işık] My mom. - And how does she know? - She went to high school, too. She knows what happens. So your mom went to a concert and fucked some guy? - Don't say that! - I'm just trying to understand. You don't have to do anything you don't want to just because you're at a concert. It's stupid not to go because what she thinks might happen. - Does she not trust you? - She's an adult, okay? - They know things. - Let's grab a bite. You shouldn't believe everything your mom says just because she's old. If she hasn't experienced it, then she doesn't know. My mother raised me to be a good person. Why shouldn't I do what she tells me? Well, in that case, we have to judge based on what kind of daughter she raised. It looks like she raised a blind follower. Therefore, she doesn't know anything. I'm confused. Are you insulting my mom now or just insulting me? He's insulting the way your mind works, sweetie. "If my mom says so, it must be true." It's a ridiculous way to think. In fact, don't think. Just get your opinions from anyone. Why read all those books then, huh? If you think people who lived before us don't matter? You never shut up about these writers. The jock wants to debate. I'm not saying they're right automatically. A little thing called "thinking for yourself." Heard about it? You're lucky my hands are full. It's like saying, "That's how my father always did it." You're better than him, too? It really means, "I'm a moron, and I don't have any ideas of my own." - Motherfucker. - Okay, chill. You have to be there for the plan to work. I'm sorry, I can't. I'm not allowed. Maybe we can do something about that. How are you gonna do that? This house is haunted. I'm gonna puke if I have to sit here any longer. Alcohol will do that to you. [Osman shushes] Thank you so much. Maybe we can help with the dishes. [Aynur] You stay right there, my dear. We can handle everything, can't we, honey? Oh, kids, I almost forgot to ask. What would you like to drink? Chocolate milk would be amazing, if you don't mind. Chocolate milk won't mix well with... Oh, he's... he's allergic. No... no chocolate for him. Oh, okay, then. I have plain milk, too. [Kerem] Careful. [Eda] We'd love to have Işık come with us. It's just a small group seeing a movie with people from school. [inhales deeply] So just a movie? Mm-hmm. I'm... I'm going to have to run this by my husband. [Osman] If I may... I assure you it's a youth-friendly event. And we got a great deal on tickets. - It's gonna be a night to remember... - I completely understand your concerns. We know there are troublemakers out there. They ruin this stuff for everyone. But if it makes you feel better, our teachers will be there chaperoning. And, do we seem like those kind of kids to you? Yes, you're right. You don't. I'm just not sure this is a decision I can make on my own. Aynur, without Işık, I have to stay home. My mom, she's only letting me go because she'll be there. Please let her go. I don't want to miss the fun. Well, I suppose. - [chuckles softly] - [Aynur laughs] Look, you all seem like such nice kids. But I expect you to listen to your teachers. Absolutely, Aynur. Whatever you think is best for your daughter. You must understand how I worry. It's just like how your families choose what's best. Every child is the most precious thing to their families. I'm just doing what any decent parent would do. Sinan. I need some air. [Aynur] Is he okay? Yeah, it-it's his allergies again. Fresh air helps him, I think. - Ah, can't be easy. - I think all parents would react the same. [Aynur] Well, you children mean the world to us. I'm sure you hear that from your own parents all the time. You can't blame us for loving you as much as we do, right? [Osman] That's right. What would we do without you? We don't want to take up any more of your night. Thank you for the snacks. [Aynur] You're welcome. Be sure to say hi to your parents for me. They seem to have done a wonderful job raising you. [barking] [man] Welcome, welcome. [heavy metal music playing] - Has the concert started? Are we late? - No, this is just the opener. - Işık, you have the tickets, right? - I do? I don't think so. Wait, right here. You need to chill out, or Ms. Distas is gonna think something's up. [exhales heavily] Where do you think they are? Oh! Kerem, Osman, right over there! - Sinan's not with them. - I bet he's passed out drunk. - Here! - Over here! - [woman] Tickets, please, ladies. - Hurry up! - Move your ass! - Coming! - Oh, come on, dude. We have to go. - Just give me a second. Hey, you gentlemen need tickets? - Can I get two? I can do 20 each. - Deal. This motherfucker just doesn't take a fucking break. - Enjoy the show! - Thanks, man! Thank you! Kerem and Burak aren't here yet? I don't know. You guys go look for some place to sit. I'll see if I can find them. - Okay, Eda. Just be careful. - Okay. Excuse me. Come on, Işık. Hey! Beverage alert. Do you really think you should be drinking? That's a good point. Why don't you take it? [rock music playing] Oh, Coach Altuna is here! Coach! Coach! Excuse me, we're over here! Keep it. What, no picnic? So, this is how an educator should behave. - These are unique circumstances. - Hey, I'm gonna go check on Kerem. - Come on, Işık. Come on, let's go! - Bye! Just like that. Have you gotten your new class schedule yet? That's what you wanna talk about? Why not? We both work there. I mean, what else do you expect us to talk about? I'm gonna head back to the bar, all right? What the fuck? Where are you going? Stay with her! You're up. All right, I'm up. Excuse me. - Coach, what a surprise. - You again? I was hoping you could do me a favor, sir. I think I have a shot with Eda tonight. But I won't get another chance. Ms. Distas has been with the girls all night. I was hoping you could keep her busy for an hour or two. Look, kid, I'm not a pimp. I'm not getting involved with adolescent hormones. Hole on a sec. I just want to get next to her and see what I can do. By now, she'll have had two beers, her cheeks will be red... She'll say the craziest things. She's just... She'll start laughing at the stupid things I say. In that special way of hers. If I'm lucky, she might tell me something she's never told anyone else. And I don't want to miss a second. - I'd rather sit here. - Fine. I'll leave you to it. - I should probably check on... - Please, stay. But, why? I want you to. Yes! [giggles] It happened? Hell, yes! This is amazing! I'm gonna dance. We fuckin' rule! Yeah, sounds like a great idea. Hey, where are you going? Huh? Os... Osman? Um... Hey, where have you been? Everyone else just left me here alone with these freaks. It's not working. Both of them are just sitting over there doing nothing. Maybe they need some encouragement from us. [man] Yeah, let's get a mosh pit going! Excuse me! Excuse me! Ma'am, I got into a fight in the bathroom, and they stole my phone. Hid it in a stall. I'm scared to go back there. Uh, Sinan, that isn't really... My parents will kill me if I lose my phone. - Okay, no problem. I'll go check. - It's in the middle stall. Okay. Uh... the men's room. I forgot to tell you. Excuse me. So sorry. [exhales heavily] Okay. Oh, so gross. - Hey, let me take care of this. - No, it's okay. I've got it. - Just leave it to me. - Should be be right here. [Burcu] Huh? - What was that noise? - Oh, it's nothing. They drank too much. Why don't we give them some space, okay? [knocking at door] [Burcu] Excuse me? Is anybody out there? Can anyone hear us? Open the door, please. - We're stuck in here. - Can anyone hear me? [pounding on door] Yeah. We're stuck in here. - Bathroom out of service, guys. - Oh, shit. OUT OF SERVICE - What's going on? - The lovebirds went into the bathroom. Are you serious? - Did you really get them alone? - You wanted me to get them together. So I put them into the tightest spot possible. I wonder what they could be doing in that filthy room. Someone has to come by soon. Makes sense, right? Any second. Mm-hmm. Fuck. - [door opens] - [footsteps approaching] I think someone's there. Excuse me? [both grunting] [man moans] Oh... - [woman moans] - [Kemal clears throat] [moaning continues] [clears throat loudly] [sighs] Oh, my God. - [man and woman continue moaning] - [thumping] [whistles] Stand back. Back there. [grunts] Let's go. Sorry for bothering you. Please continue. This is a disaster! Nothing's gonna happen between these two. Let's get out of here. [Osman] Yeah, let's go home. [Işık] But we still have her purse. That's good! Serves her right for being such a prude. [honking] Hey, wait! Stop! Hold up! Go, go, go, go, go! - Hey, driver, stop! - [whistles] Stop! Stop, stop, stop! Hey, wait! Stop! - Hey, hey, hey! - Hey! Hey, stop the bus! Stop the bus! We've got people here! Come on! Stop! [laughs] Come on. Grab a seat. I got a pass. [all sighing and panting] [pants] It's too bad we left Ms. Distas. How will she get home without her purse? It's an experience for them to share. A chance to get close. Sinan is right! We made it so they have to spend more time together. Mr. Altuna's a good guy. He'll give her a ride. Don't you think? Of course he will. If not, he's a dick who doesn't deserve to breed. Natural selection. - Guys, let's go to my house. - Why there? Well, Ms. Distas is my neighbor. We can see what happens next. We'll be able to see them come back and know for sure. If they hook up, we'll know about it right away. - That's a great idea. - Come on! I wanna know how it ends! Yeah, so do I. I can't believe I lost the kids. What if they couldn't find me, panicked, then left? I'm so stupid. [groans] And now you have to go out of your way to drive me home! It's no trouble. My car's over there. [screams] What the hell? Stop it! Someone turn that off! - [chuckles] - Open the door! Oh, my God! Open the door now! [Eda] You can keep your shoes on. Come on. Light switch is over there. Wow. Nice place. - [Işık] Which is your room, Eda? - [Eda] On the left. There. This is your classic social-climbing, middle class family. Their precious daughter, the center of everything. A nice summary of Eda's world. - You're a fucking asshole. - What, am I wrong? Your parents have plans for you. You can see it all around. They're saving up to send you to a good college. I'm guessing that's where you find a husband. You don't know the first thing about me, you psychopath. - Hold on, was he right? - [Eda] Forget it. Come on. Where do we sit? Anywhere you want. The bed, whatever. This is a surprise. Where are all the boy band posters? - I don't listen to that shit, asshole. - [Osman] A Pearl Jam fan, if I recall. - I sold you some tickets last summer. - Oh, my God. Are you a psycho, too? My business model depends on me knowing what people want. All right. Her place is over there. We have a clear view of everything. Unless Mr. Altuna's a total dick, they should be here soon. Thank you. What a mess. Oh... I'll just leave these right here. I'll take them. [groans] A little stuck. [chuckles] [exhales] This is not how I imagined tonight would go. But I'm not saying I regret anything that happened. I just... Never mind.

I'm out. - [Işık] I'll leave the purse here. - That's fine. - [Işık] See ya. - I'll head out, too. See you later. You coming? Uh, there's a road crew doing work on my street right now. - I'll wait until they're done. - [Osman] All right. Good night. [sighs] It's just here. Hey! Okay, it's really them this time! - Yeah, it is them. - Move, move! Come on! You're this close. Don't fuck it up now, please, man! He parked... Oh, shit, he's parking. Motherfucker's pulling into our driveway! That's him! Get out of the car. Yes! Maybe he'll just walk her to the door and then leave. Shut up. That's what I'm talkin' about, girl! Now go after her, don't just stand there! He needs to make a move or none of this will work. Oh, my God, this is going to give me a heart attack! Yes, man! Yes! He's going up! Wait, how are they going to get in? We still have her keys. Oh, shit! They won't be able to get in. [groans, sighs] There! The lights are on. She must have a spare key around. Now it's time to man up and kiss the girl before it all falls apart. Come on, man! Just do it! You gotta take a chance. - I think it's happening. - I just thought of something. Maybe he just needs to pee. What if he went inside to pee? You can't think like that. You're right. Positive thoughts only. Don't worry too much. It's been fifteen minutes, and he's still inside. It must have happened, right? I wonder what they're doing in there. There she is! She closed the blinds! I know what that means! We actually fucking pulled it off! Yes, yes, we did it! We did it! [closing music playing]
