Now, he's here to propose a risky project -- a modern art academy inside the world's most secluded country. [Man speaking Korean] Okay. So, you visited my country more than 11 or 12 or something. It's a good thing because then you came here not as a tourist, but you came here as a cultural exchange and mutual understanding between the countries. So, I sure appreciate your visit, but you should welcome our troops, as well, to other countries. You should be the introducer, introducing the Korean culture to the others. Traavik: I am the introducer. This is the reason why we are here, why we are having this meeting. You are aware that, in our part of the world, there is a lot of political negativity towards the DPRK. So, for each of the projects that we do together, we are like the drop that hollows out the stone, as they say. How to deal with it? What is your plan? The idea for this DMZ Academy is that by inviting artists from many countries and many continents, we are creating more and more understanding and more and more people realize that the DPRK is open. [Speaking Korean] Okay. So, according to these plans, step-by-step, that I hope to develop, improve and facilitate our cultural exchange between your country and my country.
