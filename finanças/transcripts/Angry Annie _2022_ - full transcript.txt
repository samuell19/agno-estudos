Ready to turn? Ready? – Yep. Pass the scissors. There! – Push. Pull. ANGRY ANNIE En 1973, le Mouvement pour la Liberté de I'Avortement et de la Contraception est créé en France. Il a joué un rôle fondamental dans I'avancée des droits reproductifs. Don't I have a book on order for you? Aragon, the poems. It'll be here Friday. Is that ok? Great. How much do I owe for this one? Good evening. 20 francs. Here. – Perfect, thank you. Thanks a lot. Bye. Goodbye. For books, you can talk to me. For the group, they meet in the back. Thank you, Ma'am. Hello! Welcome. Be right there. Hello. Come in, have a seat. Thank you. I'll sit here. Would you like tea? Coffeemaker's broken. No thank you. Let's get started. Don't worry, you're in the right place. We'll find a solution. I'm Monique, I work in a cheese shop. This is Hélène, she's a nurse. What we do here is illegal. But not secret. We want people to know women are aborting. There are 100 groups like ours in France, all working together. It started last year with doctors who used the Karman method. We started this group six months ago, thanks to Vivianne, who hosts us, and our two doctors. Have you heard of the Karman method? It's abortion by vacuum aspiration. The method comes from the US. It's quick and easy. 20 minutes, more or less. Do you know anyone who's aborted this way? My sister aborted with your group last November. She told me about it when I... Would you like to introduce yourself? Tell us more? There are few of us today so we can take the time. But it's up to you. My name's Françoise. I look after the kids. I've got six. The eldest is nine. We live on a single paycheck, so... I can't have this one. You don't use birth control? My husband's against it. He says I'll turn frigid and get fat. There's a lot of misinformation about the Pill. We'll talk about that later, don't worry. Do you know how far along you are? I'm a month late. You're probably at 6 weeks. We can go up to 8. Beyond, we must go to Holland or England. But don't worry, we'll go with you, we won't let you down. Françoise, have you ever had an abortion? Does it count if you do it yourself? Of course. How did it go for you? I was 17. It was the first time I had sex. And I got pregnant. I didn't want to tell my parents... Know what I mean? I had a friend with her own place. I asked if I could borrow it, she agreed. I told my folks I was with her, and gave myself an abortion. There you go. You knew you had to insert... Something into the uterus, yes. I knew that to get a D&C at the hospital you needed to bleed. Damage the egg. So... I took... I don't remember... It wasn't... I take this thing. And... I put it in. It hurts really bad. My friend finds me in a puddle of blood. I go to the hospital, and there... they give me a D&C, no painkillers. They call me a slut. "That'll teach her," they said. I'm sorry. Don't worry. What's your name? Annie. I work at the mattress factory. I have two kids, 16 and 9. I don't want any more kids. I'm done having babies. You don't use birth control either? No. We've always been careful. It usually works. But this time... rotten luck! And you? – I'm Marie-Pierre. I'm a teacher. And... I'm pregnant by a man... I'm really in love with! And... he told me he'd be careful. I believed him because he's older. At any rate, for the moment... he's not ready for a baby. Do you think you'd keep it if he were on board? Yes. Have you considered keeping it on your own? It's true that when I found out I was pregnant, my first thought was, how wonderful! I'm carrying his baby! But... when I saw his face... it wasn't wonderful anymore. Have either of you ever had an abortion? No. Yes. Once. From a neighbor lady. What did she use? Knitting needles. Want to talk about it? No. Rest assured, we don't use needles. It's completely safe. Does it hurt? It can. It depends on the woman. If you do feel pain, it doesn't last long. It's nothing like the torture of a D&C. Sorry, I was wondering... how much does it cost? Nothing. Just join our association. How do you manage? We're all volunteers. Those who can afford to may donate. It helps pay for equipment and our trips to Holland. Over there, we have to pay. I planned to pay something. If you can, that's great. How's 300 francs? Terrific. But you don't have to. And... How does it work? For starters, you need to see a doctor. First, to date the pregnancy. Also, to prescribe the medication you'll need before the abortion. We work with a doctor named Dr. Chevals. He sees our patients on Fridays. We'll meet next Wednesday to explain everything. The abortions will be the next day. On Thursday. Sound good? Yes. If possible, we'll do it at one of your homes. We can do it at mine. But it's not very big. That's ok, we just need a strong table. My table's great. Perfect. We'll give you the forms for Dr. Chevals, and Jacqueline's address for the meeting. Here. – Thank you. Thank you. Excuse me... Will I... still be able to have children? Of course. There's leftover potatoes. Oh, that's right. What's for supper? I'm starving! Cauliflower gratin. Don't you have any homework? Yes, but I already did it. Really? Sit up straight. What? – Sit straight, you'll cry less. It stings. Yes? Here, I brought this back. There was no rush. Want a cup of coffee? No thanks, my mom's expecting me. Hello. Do you want me to watch Pierrot? It's freezing outside. You don't mind? No. Someone will be thrilled! Right honey? Look who's here! The kids are upstairs, just so you know. Sure, ok. See you later. Thanks! – Off you go. See you later, Pierrot. Want to give him a kiss? Come, Pierrot honey. Paul, let's try it again. 6 x 7? When's Dad coming back? I told you, the 19th. Come on, 6 x 7? Hello? I'm waiting, Paul. I'll put her on. Bye Dad. Mom, it's Dad! You don't know your tables. Brush up, I'll quiz you. Dad! Dad! You'll talk to him after. Study your math. Go on! Hi. I'm fine, and you? I think I found a solution, but I want to discuss it first. Have a good day. – You too. Kids! Let's go! When will it be? Next week, Thursday. But first we meet up to talk. Talk about what? I don't know. Is it really free? It is? – Yes. But the best part is... real doctors do... the thing. Just be careful. Nothing ever comes for free. I don't see why it's free, especially with doctors. Annie, why didn't you come Tuesday? The shop delegation went to the boss's office. I'm not into all that political stuff! Why are you whispering? Look! These are for you. There's that sweater of Paul's you like, he finally outgrew it. And two nice pairs of pants for Remi. Thank you. My pleasure. – Look at this! Hi Annie, how's it going? Another gab session? You bet! Kids! Time to go! – Let's go, guys. Last one out is a rotten egg. Don't make a mess. Come on, chop chop! Relax. It's just as you said. You're about 6 or 7 weeks pregnant. You can get dressed. They explained, but I'll go over it again. Betadine is an antiseptic. Atropine keeps you from passing out. And Buscopan is a shot to prevent spasms. Norquentiel is the Pill. I prescribed it for a year. Oh, all right. Don't hesitate if you have any questions. I don't know. How many pregnancies have you had? I have two children, I had one miscarriage... and an abortion 7 or 8 years ago. How did it go? What? Everything? – Yes. Nothing special... Normal. I mean... For the rest... I don't know... Mom? – Yeah? Can you quiz me on my history? I don't have time. Please? – I haven't got time! I'm helping a girlfriend out, I'm not home tonight. Same thing tomorrow, remember? Move your notebook, I'm cleaning. You remember? – Yes, I remember. You need to fetch Paul at the neighbors'. Can I see Christiane and the baby? Yes, but don't stay late. So... we'll insert the speculum... You can touch it. Once it's in place, we can see the cervix. After that, we'll use the dilators to dilate the cervix very gently and slowly. There are several sizes. Here. How do you choose the size of the dilator? We go from smallest to largest. This one's in the middle. Not much thicker than the smallest. Once the cervix is nice and open, the cannula is inserted. See the small notches at the end? Then very gently, moving it back and forth, the egg is detached from the uterus. It's very flexible, so it can't harm your uterus. Go ahead and touch it. All the tiny membranes are detached little by little. Then we aspirate with the bike pump. Everything goes into the bottle. Then it's over. That's it? – Yes. You ladies want soup? There's plenty! With pleasure! – I'm good, thanks. How nice of you. Excuse me. – Yes? I don't understand. You aspirate with a bike pump? I'm sorry, I wasn't very clear. Actually, the bike pump sucks the air out of the bottle. We'll demonstrate so it's clear for everyone. I clamp here. Then I pump, to remove the air from the bottle. Watch. It needs to be there. A little more. Once all the air has been removed from the bottle, we unclamp, and suction. Hear that? Then, everything is gently removed. Do you understand? Watch out! Look at Paul. Honey, I need to go soon. Don't wait for me tonight. I don't know what time I'll get back. You can heat up the stew on the stove. And make sure Paul goes to bed early. What's wrong with your friend? Nothing, she's fine. I just need to help her with something. Listen... if I'm not back in the morning, go see Christiane. Why do you say that? No reason. I'll be back. Just in case. Off I go. Hello. – Hi Annie. Please, come in. Hello Annie! – Hi. Go ahead and join them in the living room. Come on. – Hello ladies. Hello sir. We'll make room. Hi, I'm Jean. A doctor for the group. I work with Hélène at the hospital. Ok. See you in a bit. – Sure. Come sit down. – Hello Annie. Hello. Have you met Nicole? – No. I've been with MLAC for 6 months, but missed the last meeting. Ok. Let's begin. Who feels ready to go first? I do. Let's go then. Aren't you hot? Yes, I am. Careful, here comes the jab. There we go. There, all done. Leave that here. It didn't hurt? – No, I'm fine. It's going to be fine. Hop up here. Got it? That's right, good. Can you scoot back a little? Here. There, that's good. Are you comfortable? – Yes. You need to scoot your bottom forward. Look, move forward. Right to the edge of the table. Like that? – Yes. Are you cold? – No. We do have socks. I'm fine, thanks. Don't worry, it's going to be fine. Can you open your legs a little? There, perfect. Are you ready to start? Yes. I'm going to insert the speculum. It's not pleasant but it's quick. Annie, do you know what your cervix looks like? No. Look, I'll show you. Take the mirror. Put it between your legs. Like that. There. See that pretty little pink ball? Yes. That's your cervix. That's my cervix? – Yes. Pretty, isn't it? – It is! It closed after fertilization. 2 or 3 centimeters beyond the cervix is your uterus. Can you picture it? Yes. I think so. We'll start with Betadine to disinfect. Breathe. That's right. Look at me. Stay with me. Have you been married long? Yes, 20 years. Sounds like true love. Oh, I don't know about that. I'm going to use the tenaculum to hold your cervix. Ok? Here I go. Focus on me. Breathe. Like this. Inhale deeply. Now come the dilators. Very good. Ready? Here comes the first dilator. Ok. Breathe in, that's right. Breathe. Look at me. Stay with me. Very good. Are things going well at work? Yes, uh... You're at the factory? Yes. – You're doing great. I have good workmates. That's important. – Yes, it's nice. Pass me the cannula. Will this hurt? Annie, I'm pumping now... like I explained. Removing the air from the bottle. Shall I sing you a song? Yes, please. I'm detaching the membranes. If it hurts, be sure to tell me. Ok. What shall I sing? Look at me. Breathe. It'll soon be over. Stay with me. Does it hurt? I'm going as fast as I can. Look at me, stay with me, breathe. May I continue? – Yes, you may. Breathe. Ok, it stopped. Can you sing some more? I think we're done. Let me check. Almost done. Does it still hurt? How do you feel? Just a little but it's not bad at all. Ok. – You can continue. No, you can sit up if you like. Is it over? Yes, it's over. Yes. – Oh wow! That's it. I'm hot. I'm so hot. Ready to get down? – Incredible. Lean on me. There, like that. Thank you. Thanks so much! Thanks, Doctor. Jean. My name's Jean. Thanks Jean. – Take this. I'm sorry. Don't apologize. It didn't hurt at all! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you for the song! If I'd known, I wouldn't have been so scared. Is this good, Marie-Pierre? Yes. We put everything else back too. Be right back. I'm going to check the pasta. It went well. Off I go. I'm on call tonight. Do I keep the suitcase this week? Yes. Ok. Bye everyone. Bye Jean! Pasta's ready. – Everything's here. Dinner is served! Thanks Nicole. – We're hungry! Hits the spot. Good pasta, Marie-Pierre! Thank you. What about the Pill? For me it was a liberation. Yeah, being able to have sex with no anxiety... It's amazing! But it's expensive. I asked my doctor about it and he sent me packing. Me too. – I didn't dare. Men have always had the power to decide if we get pregnant. Imagine if we women could choose. That's a revolution! For them, a woman who can fuck freely with no fear of getting pregnant is obviously... A slut. – Exactly! I'll get it. – No, I will. I never thought about things like that. It's Bernard, my husband. It went really well! Well, I'm going to go. Thank you so much. We can give someone a ride. I'd like that. Ok. – Girls... Observe your temperature and bleeding for the next few days. And remember your follow-up next week with Dr. Chevals. Yes, of course. Thank you. Bye girls. Goodbye. You're not alone tonight, just in case? No, my daughter's home, plus my neighbor. So... I don't know how to thank you. You could come back and help out. No, I wouldn't know what to do. Plus with work and the kids... I haven't been here long myself. Well, goodbye. Bye, Marie-Pierre. Bye, Nicole. Goodbye Annie. – Thank you. Hello? Yes! You're not bothering me, I wasn't asleep. Really? It went really well. I'll tell you all about it. The people were so nice. No, hardly at all! Mom? Honey. Aren't you sleeping? Was it fun with your friends? Yes. We left you some stew. It was delicious. You look tired. You're right. It's time for bed. Come on, I'll tuck you in. My sweetheart. Everything looks good. The MLAC team did a great job. Any questions? No. Thank you. Hello? Hello Ma'am. Yes. Of course. No. Calm down. Listen, come see me tonight. In my office. At 7pm, after my last patient. Goodbye Ma'am. Excuse me, Doctor. Why do you do all this? Why? Listen... I've seen many women who would do anything to end their pregnancies. One day a woman came to my office. "Doctor, I'm 38, I have 5 children and I'm pregnant." She put a probe on the table. "Doctor, if you put the probe in me, I'll pay you 100,000 francs." I told her I couldn't. I said she had to keep it. "You know the law, and what I risk." She was desperate. Two weeks later she killed herself. I should have been there. No, don't worry. I'm fine! Hold on, I've got something to show you. You'll see. What is it? See, that's the uterus. And this is called a cannula. It's flexible so it can't puncture the uterus, like knitting needles. Is that a syringe? Yes, it depends on the group. This group uses a reverse bike pump. A doctor did it? – Yes, a young one. So different from the ones we're used to. He talks to you. He explains everything he does. It's really clever. Plus I'm on the Pill. Really? You're on the Pill? I am. Now let's hear about your new boss. Ugh, let's not. Dad, show us the presents! Let's go! Well, well... Were you good? – Yes! Look at him! – Know your times tables? Yeah. – Here. Wow! Indians! Here, honey. Hope you like the color I picked. And a coffeemaker for Mom. This is a coffeemaker? – Yep. Like it? But mine works fine. This one's Italian, the best! Make us some coffee? Hi. – Hey. Did you know we were coming? – Yes. You know Gilles? – No. Nice to meet you. Hey guys. Hi Philippe, how are you? – Good, you? I won't keep you. I've got the union pamphlets. Let's talk. Ok. Life begins at conception "Abortion is the murder..." "of an innocent." "An innocent." Honestly, they're insane. Makes me sick. There's something else. Yeah, another article. There! Fifty abortions, wow. The right to life and the right to death "Hospitals host MLAC groups." "50 abortions in a family planning clinic." "Catholic family associations protest abortions." The Catholics are mad. Switzerland relaxes abortion laws, dividing the government and opinion Back to work! – Right. Wait. What bullshit. Come on. I see Christiane stopped by. I babysat Pierrot while she was out. That was kind. Here we go. Bean stew. Anybody home? Annie? Roger? – Annie, Christiane's not well. What's up? We went to one of those ladies. But it's not right. We heard she was good, but Christiane's in pain and bleeding. Let's get her to the hospital. Go get her! Get the van, we're going to the hospital. Quick! Christiane's got a bad tummy ache. We're off to the hospital, the kids are upstairs! How do I tell the kids, Annie? What do I say? I'll make some tea. I should have sensed it when she came yesterday. Why didn't she tell me? And I... Stop beating yourself up. If only I'd told her... Come on. Time to get some sleep. Hello ladies. Vivianne, I can't find the... – Hello. Oh hello! I came to help out. I brought a coffeemaker. If I remember right, yours wasn't working last time? Great! Are you alright? Yes. Finding everything you need? – Yes. I'll have the coffee right out. Great, thanks. I have a present for you. The Female Orgasm Thanks. – I saw you eyeing it. Anyone over 8 weeks, follow me into the shop. Don't worry, the shutters are down. We'll explain how the trips work. Let's go. Look, there's a spot over there. Help yourselves. Annie, here. Can you help them fill these out? Ok. Everything ok? Did you fill in the form? You can sit here. So... What's your name? Chantal. How old are you? – 17. Did you come alone? You didn't tell your mother? – No. Does she know you have a boyfriend? I don't have a boyfriend. Ok. Don't worry. Everything's going to be fine. I'm afraid it'll hurt. That's normal, I understand. But you'll see, it'll be over fast. Everything'll be fine. Did you do it too? Yes. Everyone here has done it. Now, Chantal... Can you tell me when your last period was? I'm sorry, it took me awhile to realize what happened. I'm sorry. – Don't apologize. Don't worry. – I'm sorry. We'll take good care of you. Nothing is your fault, ok? It's going to be fine. Come join us. We'll explain everything. You ok? – Yes. Howdy everyone! Richard, this isn't the market. Sorry. Seen the paper? – No. Great! This is amazing! "NO MORE SECRETS" – The Karman Method "NO MORE SECRETS" The Karman Method – Non-Surgical Abortions I'm so happy you came. Yeah, it's great. Thank you, I enjoyed it. Yes? It's good when there are lots of us. Shit, it's Hervé. Bye girls! Goodbye everyone. I'll give you a ride, it's on my way. I helped out. It was pretty easy! There were more women, so it's good there were lots of us. I discovered an incredible organization! The trips to Holland are really expensive. They negotiated a deal with the clinics there: 10 abortions for the cost of 8! Can you believe it? It's nuts! I was amazed. It's good you're involved. Speaking of which, today the boss came to see us. Wait'll you hear this. Thierry was with me... That's what I was about to explain. Today there are two groups. One with Jean, and one with Claudine whom you met earlier. It'd be great if you could decide together who's going first. We'll get started soon. See you in there. I'll go make some tea. You ok? I'm scared. Don't worry. See, I came like you asked. And I'll be here when you're done. I want you to stay with me. Please. Hello. Hello. Seen the doctor? I'm the doctor. I'm sorry, Doctor! It's ok. No need to be formal. – Ok. The girl wants me to stay with her, but I've never done it. Jean gave me an abortion a few weeks ago, I wanted you to know. It's great if you stay. Ok. Hello. I'm Claudine. – Hello. What's your name? – Chantal. I'll be giving you your abortion, Chantal. Everything's going to be fine. It's almost over. There we go. We're done. It's finished. You were great. Really great. Scoot your bottom up to the edge. A little bit closer. What's wrong? It's going to be fine, don't worry. It's not that. Tell me what's wrong? I can't. Can't what? This baby... Do you want to keep it? My husband says we can't... It's not your husband's decision. If you want to keep it, then keep it. Ok? Shall we take you home? Do you want to see your cervix? No! It's bad, what I'm doing is bad! It's ok. It's bad... – Breathe deeply. I'm going to dilate your cervix. That's good. – No, it's not good! What I'm doing is bad! Keep your legs open, please. What can I do? I'm exhausted, but I have no right. You have the right. Now I'll insert the cannula. The what? – It's almost over. The what? – The cannula. Remember? – Monique will pump... Breathe with me. Monique will work the pump. It's wrong what I'm doing. No it's not. I love my kids. – Of course you do. You love your kids. But I'm too tired. – Of course. I can't, I'm tired. You're doing the right thing. Relax. Just a little more. This can hurt a bit, but it won't last long. Almost done. – It hurts. Almost done. Breathe. I'm being gentle. This is bad. It's a sin. No. Now we're done. – Breathe deeply. We're checking now. – Good. It's over. It's all done. Can I see? Yes, you can see. Look. Is that it? Yes, that's it. See? It's not much. Did it go well? – Yes, and you? I'll tell you about it. This is lovely! – Beautiful. Thank you. How are you, Chantal? You're enjoying that! Tasty? This one's good, you tried it? It's all over your mouth. Well, I'm off. I'm on call again. Have fun, Jean. Bye. Bye everyone. – Goodbye, Jean. How many children do you have? Five. How old are you? – 25. Do you have children? Yes. Two. They're all grown up now. Two is nice. Two or three. My mom had eleven. Can you pass them out? Jean never hangs around afterwards. You stay sometimes. It's because he's not a woman. Know what he said before he left? "Who's sterilizing the tools this week?" It's just a question. – No! He's like a boss giving out orders. You're too sensitive. We're not his damn maids! You spoke to the young woman? Yes, I did. We spend our lives in silence. What we're doing here is wonderful! All those shameful topics are made noble. She's so classy! Why does she help you? We all have our reasons. Even the mayor's wife came for an abortion. No way! It's quicker and more private than a clinic. True. Céline doesn't just host us. She pays for the bus or clinic in Holland when we're short. She doesn't advertise it. You were amazing today. It'd be great if you could come again. Ok. You scared me. Sorry, honey. It's freezing in here. How'd it go with Paul? – Good. I taught him how to do long division. Poor thing, he was lost! That stuff's hard. Thanks, sweetie. You're amazing. Caroline? If you liked a boy, would you know how to protect yourself? Why are you asking, Mom? No particular reason. Sorry, maybe this isn't the time. My mother didn't tell me anything. I really want us to be different. If you have any questions, just ask me. I'm going to bed. Shall we turn out the light? Wait a sec... What is it? The Female Orgasm Have you got a "D" anywhere? I think so, yes! Sex shops, yes. Birth control, no. Long live hypocrisy! Oh yeah! Not too much paint. Make the first letters thicker. Good enough. I did what I could. Do you need anything? Need anything? If you need something, now's your chance. No one cares? That looks great! Looks good. But why did you skip the stencils? Because I feel like it. Ok, if you feel like it, that's your choice. You're coming along. Yep. – Nice blue. Hey everyone. Hello. This is Denis. Pleasure. Richard. Vivianne, the owner. And Alain. Are the others here? – Yes. I'll go, the place is packed. Headquarters is back there? Yes, I'll show you later. What are you making, Alain? A banner for the bus. – Looks huge. "We just had abortions... "in Holland." Like it? – It's 20 meters. Wow, amazing. Hi, everyone. This is Denis. An ENT willing to be trained. – Hello. With us two, plus Claudine, we can do 9 abortions a week. Great, but it's not enough. It's good, though. Remember, our mission is not to meet all the demand. It's to showcase the scandal. The abortions must be exemplary. Which women aren't "exemplary?" What she means is it won't cover all the women who come to us. It's hard to find doctors. We'll have to start doing it ourselves. Anyone got tape? – Over there. Sorry about the tense welcome. No worries. Everyone is exhausted. There's a lot of demand these days. I get it. It was just us two. – You're Claudine? She's a gynecologist. – Right. So I'll be training you. Bye. Richard? I'd like a poster to hang up at work. I'll get one. Can you hang this here? Sure. That's a good idea. BETTER TO BE BORN WANTED Hey, Vivianne... There's a guy out there, next to the blue car. He's been there for hours, watching us. Right, he's the cop from Intelligence. Intelligence? – Yeah. It's good. Is he still there? Yes. – Denis, come say hi to the cop. I feel bad for him. To change the abortion law, we need visibility. He takes notes, observes the women. It's good for us. He sees the scale of the problem. Exactly. A friend of mine said the Paris meeting last week had 300 women. Outside, in broad daylight. A disgrace for the government. They already look bad since the number came out. 5,000 deaths from illegal abortion a year. 5,000! – Some say 300, some 2,000. We can't be sure. In any case, it's far too many. Bye. – Bye, Annie! Need a lift? – Yes, please. Jean, can you take me? – Sure. Bye! How are you? – Good. How'd it go with the kids? – Good. Are they sleeping? Annie, I want no trouble with the cops. Don't worry. It's illegal, after all. Yes, but... It's illegal. Yes, but listen. Remember the 300 doctors who signed a manifesto declaring they practice abortion? Yes. 700 doctors wanted to sign! But only 300 did, so they wouldn't outnumber the 343 Sluts' Manifesto. The government is stuck now. They can't attack 300 doctors! After the last doctor was found guilty, there was such a big protest that they let him off! And we're up to 150 MLAC groups. They can't throw us all in jail! That many? – Yeah! They're everywhere. Exactly. And what we do... "Direct, collective action"... It's so beautiful, right? We'll make them understand they can't stop women from aborting. Once they see no one respects the law anymore, they'll have to get to work and change that damn law! So the boss took the poster down? He won't be taking this one down! We'll put 10 of them up. Is it true that it's free? Yes. Hélène said to tell you we need more speculums. She can't get any more at the hospital. She prefers the plastic ones. They're warmer. Can you order some? Sure, no problem. – Thanks. How's it going? Good. No trouble with the aspirations? Not at all. It's simple. Here. They're all signed. Thank you. You say it's simple... Read this. What is it? "Anything that transforms a doctor into a mere service provider "acting solely on the demand of the user "goes against the patient's well-being. "An abortion requested by a woman "and not decided by a doctor "becomes a strictly technical act, intolerable to the medical profession." The Medical Regulatory Authority wrote that letter. They say a doctor with years of experience must diagnose. And not simply cater to a woman's request to abort. If the law passes, it'll challenge their power to decide. And then if certain people say, "We can do it, it's a simple procedure." Just imagine. They fiercely protect their power. What a bunch of old pricks! Go get 'em, Annie! So... Here. You'll make these sausages. 15 minutes in the frying pan. That's a pot. This is the pan. Here. Use the pot for the rice. 10 minutes, once the water is boiling. 2 handfuls per person. Don't forget the salt. You'll be eating with Paul. Caro feels unwell, but save her some. I'm off to MLAC. – Again? Yes. – Will you be late? It's hard to say. You'll help me. And that's it. We're done. Thank you. Are you ok? – Yes. May I? There. Lie back. Nice and easy. That's right. It's going very well. Good. Good. You can relax now. Breathe. We're with you. Breathe. That's good, that's good. And we're done. I have to get up. Have you guys had breakfast? – Yes. Mom? A girlfriend of mine saw you. Why didn't you tell me? I don't know. I guess I didn't realize you'd grown up. Is that how Christiane died? What do you do there? Well... I welcome the women. Meaning I talk to them. We find strength together, because we find solutions together. We are together. And... I'm learning so many things. Like what? For example... The MLAC women showed me something. I'll show you. Come. What is it? So you can look at your vulva. No way, Mom! No, but... It's important, honey. We need to know our bodies. You'll gain from being less ignorant than your mother. Trust me. Understand how it's done? Yes. Pretty simple, as we said. Easy as pie. When will your group start? We don't know yet. We're looking for a location. But if the law passes, we'll be ready. Med school doesn't teach how it's done. Now we know the equipment. Any questions? Do you know how to talk to women? You mean "verbal anesthesia?" How can you concentrate if you talk? We manage. But I like to focus on what I'm doing. We have the room for 10 more minutes. Take off your pants. Excuse me. Get on the table. I'll take that. Put your feet in the stirrups. That's right, good. Here. Good. Come forward. See my hand? Scoot your bottom up to my hand. More, more... there. Good. Spread your legs. Abortion or not, we speak differently to a woman in this position. And you're in underwear. I understand. We see women who've had 5 kids and don't know what their cervix is. Some think babies and urine come out the same hole. All because doctors lay them down and do the procedure alone, in silence, content with themselves. Those days are over. – Ok. You must transmit your knowledge. – Ok. It's very important. Your turn. No, I'm fine. I got it! How can the Medical Regulatory Authority maintain such unyielding positions? You're awfully tired. I had a shitty day. Michel got injured on the machinery. No way! Nothing serious, but... the company won't cover it, so we called a meeting. Did you change something? New haircut? No. Is it your eyebrows? No! I'm gonna make some coffee. I know you won't let me say much, because, obviously, I'm in a separate studio. I'll just say what I have to say before I get interrupted. Philippe! Get the door, it's Hélène! All women know raising children is more traumatizing than having an abortion. An abortion done conscientiously, delicately... I forget who said it earlier, since I was not allowed to speak... Come quick! Someone said these are special cases, and they are. Every woman should abort the way she wants. In her own bedroom if she wishes. And the hospitals, as Dr. Netter says, do not have the capacity to handle all the abortions women need in France. So it stands to reason that we must look beyond hospitals to paramedical teams who are very capable of doing this. No need to be a member of the medical establishment to carry out today's simple abortion procedures. You evoked "vagabond sexuality." The minister evoked "vagabond sexuality." I find such words utterly contemptuous. Appalling. Women's sexuality is no more "vagabond" than men's sexuality. Young women should not be categorized as "vagabond" or "not." I find that absolutely revolting. Such terms should not be heard. You ask whether it's reasonable to "give freedom." You're all men. Millions of women in France, and you ask, "Can we give them freedom?" "Are they capable of being responsible?" Basically, you see us as silly, stupid little things. Puppies to take out for a walk. We're not given autonomy. Autonomy over our bodies. We risk our lives daily for our freedom. Women risk their lives to abort. I think that means we know what we want. You can't keep getting an abortion every 3 months. You need to take the Pill. No, I don't want to. Why not? I'd have to say yes to my husband every night, and that's out. I get a week's break per month. I'd die without it. At least I can say I'm ovulating. That it's a bad time. How do I say no if I'm on the Pill? Do I say, "I don't want you?" I can't do that. Your husband doesn't have to know you're on the Pill. Think it over. Come. I'll leave you with the others, ok? Let's make some room for you. Over there? There's a spot. Where'd you like to sit? – Anywhere. I'm out of questionnaires. Use these blank papers for now. Will that work? Are you ok? Are you sure? You seem upset. It's Hervé. He scares me so much! Oh honey! Did you hear Pompidou died? Hi, Monique. Serge, Monique... – Hi. A friend from MLAC. Awfully pretty, for a Red nun! Monique is staying the night. Here. Want a drink? Water? – Ok, be right back. Sorry, I'm going to bed. You don't look well, my poor Annie. I'm just tired, that's all. You picked the wrong fight with abortions. Seriously, screw you! We help women for real. We don't just run our mouths all day! You put up with that? Your wife is never home. Your son's on his own, out in the streets. Stop it, Serge. Leave us alone. We're all in the struggle. Anyway, it's late. Honestly, what's his problem? I don't like what he said about Paul. His outbursts aren't new, but in front of the children? It's freaking me out. I understand. Maybe he'll calm down now. Seeing you didn't come home and all. He knows I'll never leave the kids. This is pointless. No it's not! It gives you a breather. And shows him that there are limits, dammit! Don't worry. It'll be alright. See, you jab here. Aim for the upper right quadrant. I'm not sure. Here? Go ahead. I'm not afraid. Hang on. Look. Can I pull up my pants? – Sure, thanks. Practice on this, it's quite similar. Or I can show you the pelvic exam. No, no! Hélène, I can't. I can talk to women, sing them songs, hold their hands, but... I can't touch their bodies. I'm too afraid of hurting them. Don't worry, I understand. I can't do it! – I'd like to learn. So... – Yes... There. – Wait, it's difficult. Here's a pillow. Ah, right. – Yeah? Do you feel it? Feel it? – It's soft. Soft? Feel anything a bit rougher? Yeah, I feel a... a rougher part. That's your prostate zone. What? We have a prostate? – Yes! Yes. – Wow! Who knew? Yeah, well... Right, ok. So... It's so weird! When I laugh, it... It squeezes my fingers! It squeezes your fingers. That's your perineum. Right. – Understand? We have no clear political allies. As usual. Stay strong, keep the pressure on. Elections are a month away. Anything could happen. What about the bookstore? We're getting swamped. You don't realize, Denis. Our priority now is public outreach. There are over 200 MLACs in France. That's huge. We can't handle all the women. Then what do we do? We can't pick and choose Denis. That's rotten. And there aren't enough of us. I know. You'll have to explain it to them. Get them politicized too. They need a social conscience. As for the abortions, they can go to Holland. With what money? What about those who work or have children? You tell them! What can we do for these women? We need more volunteers. I may know someone, but no promises. I only just mentioned it. I'm training an anesthesiologist. Great! When will he be ready? Why don't you train me? You're not a doctor. But I'm a nurse. I'm here and I have experience. Does your anesthesiologist know women's bodies? Can he use a speculum? I can. I know you've acquired skills, working as assistants. Stop calling us assistants, we're not receptionists! It's a medical procedure. Doctors must do it. Absolutely. I won't risk training non-doctors. Seriously, what risk? What risk? Women will abort with just anyone, and we know how that ends. Exactly. Are you afraid of losing your power? This isn't about medical power, it's about medical safety. You're clearly unaware of the risks. No Denis, you can't say that. Sorry, I can. Go on, call us airheads! We spend our time telling women the method is perfectly safe. It's perfectly safe, but only for doctors? That's so contradictory! You fight the power at the hospitals but won't train the women in your MLAC? That's not it. That's exactly it! And dammit. We all know abortions are far safer than childbirth. And who delivers babies? Midwives! Exactly. They're not doctors. She's not wrong. If something goes wrong? We'll do as you do. If a woman hemorrhages, you go to ER. I'll do the same. Denis, I'm as capable as you are. I may not have your degree, but I'm all the more vigilant for it. And remember, we've had no complications. Maybe, yes. Jean, aren't you fighting the doctors' monopoly on power? Yes. This is the heart of it. What do we do? If you feel capable, you can do it. Did you tell Jean? – But! Not the same days as me, so I can help. Any doubts, go to the hospital. I'm ready, don't worry. – I know. Monique, you'll assist her. – Ok. Annie, you'll continue with me? – Ok. Everyone agree? Watch your head. – Careful of the suit. You smell good! – My dress... Watch your nylons too. Stay seated, Paul. Let's get this show on the road! Be right there! Claudine, what's going on? Monique's unavailable, Hélène's on duty. I'm on my own. I've got a wedding today. – I know. The woman's in a very complicated situation. Can't it wait until Tuesday? What's up? Hello. There's a woman... There's an emergency. Bad timing. – Yeah. I'll wait in the car. – Coming. I'm sorry, I'm with my family. C'mon, Mom! I really can't. Mom! Annie, you've lost your head! Your cervix is open. I'm inserting the cannula. Ok. Feel ok? There. Breathe. It's going very well. We'll start emptying out the air now. Ok. I'm starting the aspiration. It may cause light contractions. All good, may I continue? – Yes. Thanks. So, was it nice? Yes. Everyone sends their love. I'm sorry, kids. Was it fun anyway? Yeah, all the cousins were there! So... did Dad go out? He left you a note by the phone. I'm staying with Serge for a few days. So? – Great banner! WE JUST ABORTED IN HOLLAND Great! Where? – Anywhere. Perfect, huh? – Really nice. In general... there are more and more women. Around a dozen or so each time. Bye! So... that's the deal. I don't know if I can do it. Sure you can. Answer these questions, then we'll talk. We'll sit down and talk to each of you. Find out where you're from, whether you've been pregnant before... We'll give you information sheets. Hello. Monique, can I get some of those? May I have one? Wasn't there a form? – Here you go. Fill it out the best you can. Share your pencils. Hélène... There are so many women outside. What do we do? Ok, don't worry. Are there more outside? Hello. Take a form. Listen up, everybody. Can I have your attention? We can't take everyone. – What? We can only take 15 women this week. 15! I'm sorry, we know that's not enough. But there aren't enough of us to treat you all. The State lets us do all the work. They want to wear us out. We must stay strong. The press is covering us daily. We have no time! We must keep pressuring them. We must obtain abortion rights for all women. I'm sorry, as I said, we're doing our best. This week we can only take 15 women. How do we choose? I don't know how to choose. You're at 8 weeks? You too? Are you at 8 weeks? Women with means will come forward on their own. We have to trust each other on this. When was your last period? I don't know. Your last period? Can you remember? 2 months ago, I don't know! Stop fidgeting. Let your sister explain. Good evening. Good evening. How are you? I'm teaching him Crapette. I don't get it. I'll make dinner. Set the table, ok? Easy! Avoiding me? Not at all. I put Paul to bed, I'm doing dishes, I'm busy. Annie... Where do you want this? Here's good. Go to bed, honey. I've got this. Annie, I don't want us to be at war. So, for José's wedding... let's forget it. And no more talk of abortion in this house. And what's this thing with... Come. – What? Come! Caroline wants to start a youth MLAC with her friends! What's wrong with that? They're learning about their bodies, sharing their experiences. There's nothing wrong with that! I wish I'd had that at their age! Do you hear me? Do you hear? I'm sick of this shit! I want you to quit. Philippe, I can't quit. The girls need me, we're winning the fight! We need you! The kids! Get a replacement, you're not indispensable. Are you indispensable? No. – Yes. I get a replacement at work. I'm sorry, but you can't compare your work to our group. It's far less... essential. Sorry to be so blunt Philippe, but... Get a replacement. Listen... I'm doing abortions myself. That's why I can't be replaced. See? You're crazy. You've lost your mind. Who do you think you are? You can't enjoy this. You don't get it. I prepared a bag for you, my friend. Thanks. Wonderful. You seem well. I'm tired, but... I feel so useful. If I'd known, I'd have gone to school. But I had to work. How many are you now? Not enough. Claudine's stopping. You know she's pregnant, right? Have you found someone to replace her? Yes. I'm currently setting up a second suitcase. I see. I'll write you a letter. If anyone bothers you, say the suitcase is mine. ABORTION – CONTRACEPTION! WOMEN ALONE DECIDE! Hello? – Is it my teacher? – Annie, it's Monique. Monique, where are you? So glad I reached you. I'm leaving. Really? And the kids? They're coming with me. We're going to my cousin's in Paris. That's wonderful! Do you have enough money for the train and all? Yes, don't worry. We'll be fine. Ok. Can you tell the girls? I didn't have time. Yes, of course. In any case, I'm really happy for you. Give me news, ok? Yes, as soon as I can. – I'll call once I'm settled in. – Ok. Annie, I gotta go. Take care. You too, take care. Goodbye, speak soon. Is this one good? – Yeah, that's great. The flashlight! Get the one in the drawer. Check that it works. Good. Put the compresses in the box. Mirror. Good. Perfect. Thank you, my daughter. All good, girls? – Yeah. Bye, Caro! – Bye. Bye, honey. Off we go. I would like to sit down! Not that she's sick, but... I'll take your hand. It's a bit tricky for me, thanks. Shall we talk about Giscard or look away? In any case, I think it's good that he's young. Hang on, he says the Pill will be covered. That's huge. To free and unlimited birth control! Still a long way off in Spain. So now they'll cover contraception, but for abortion, the problem is they'll give us... the minimum! They won't do that. Abortions will continue even when women get the Pill for free. For sure. – 10% of women take the Pill. It won't magically rise to 80% overnight. The real problem is there's no sexual education. We need sex ed. We need to take more emblematic actions. Abortions aren't enough. Wow. Excuse me, Denis. Are you saying 300 groups in France aren't doing enough? The groups are essential, we all agree! But we must do more. Make them tremble at our disobedience! Meaning? Our radical doctor friends... You piss me off. Thierry and Philippe. – Exactly. They did an abortion in public at the hospital. How awful! That's absolutely not true. They didn't do a public abortion. They did it privately in a room. Reporters were outside. That's appalling! The reporters made it front page news! Imagine the poor woman! The point is it made news and advanced our cause. That's political. And what we do isn't political? The struggle is bigger. If we can heal without the State, we can organize without a boss. And govern without a president. Revolution! Right. So for you, abortion is a way to mobilize the people and overthrow the government? I'm saying the struggle is bigger. True revolution will be when women know their bodies and can choose what to do with them. That's true revolution. You don't understand a thing! My jacket. You're leaving? Yeah, talk it over and call me when you make real progress! And now... a certain Paul... will come and show me how he folds. Go on. Go on, honey. How do I do it? Work with your sister. Move closer... Making waves! Make waves, air out the sheet. Then you can do a clack! Clack! THE NEWS AT ONE – 24 HOURS ON CHANNEL 1 The bill to legalize abortion was voted into law this morning by a margin of 284 votes to 189. It was nearly 4 am when the vote was held. A victory for Health Minister Mrs. Veil, who declared, "I hope everyone will see this is the best solution." Thanks to the neighboring MLAC for attending this post-legalization meeting. The public authorities will now handle abortions. In theory, we're done. When will the services open? How many will there be? Giscard wants to demobilize us with this law. Stop the women's movement. Veil simply reestablished the social order. Aborting isn't an illness. Aborting at the hospital is just a way for medical authorities to maintain social control. They'll know who aborts, when and why. Once again, women won't decide. Doctors authorize the procedure, or not. Veil did say that only the woman decides. Without her husband's authorization, as in other countries. Isn't that good? But MLACs are closing. Where will women go? Until the law is enacted? It's a classist law. National healthcare won't cover abortion. Poor women won't be able to afford one. Immigrant women are excluded. And minors need parental authorization, so... Many will return to the backstreet angel makers! Exactly. Can't we celebrate just a little? Because abortions will be in hospitals? Women will be isolated. That's not what we wanted. So we continue. You're willing to be outlaws? The conscience clause is a problem. What if all the doctors play that card? The law won't be applied. Veil had to make concessions in order to get the law passed. I'd like to say something. I'm a gynecologist, like Claudine. I want to point out that the law is designed to protect women. That's what we wanted: for hospitals to do their job. We did it. So we stop. Now we doctors must fight. We need to get the services opened and make sure abortions are safe and well-covered. We fight now, at the hospital. That's important. Well... I'm afraid women will be facing their abortions very alone. They'll never find the solidarity we share. Will doctors care for women as well as we do? I don't know. My abortion with MLAC was more positive than giving birth at the hospital. That's not right. Giving birth should be beautiful. Is there tenderness at the hospital? Tenderness is political. And this isn't because we're women. It applies to all. There can be respect, at least. Yes, but... how will women be treated? I feel we're abandoning them. I think enough doctors believe in the cause to make it positive. But now that we're trained, why leave it to doctors? I don't know. We're going to lose our know-how. And in 10 years, 20 years, 50 years if a new government changes the law... we'll have forgotten how to do it, and then what? I want my daughter to be able to abort if she needs to. I want her to be able to give her friends abortions. I don't want her alone at the hospital with just anyone. And also, I mean... The thought of losing all we've gained together upsets me. For me, aborting with you all, and giving other women abortions, I found... strength, confidence, that's new for me. And I don't want to lose all that. All that tenderness, all that rigor. It really makes me upset. Where will you live? I told you, with my Aunt Gisèle. Then I'll be in a working women's dormitory. But why do you want to change jobs? Because I've realized there's so much I can do. And... I may even be needed. Would there happen to be a present for Paul in here? What could it be? What could it be? This will tell you the answer to 8 x 6! 8 x 6? 48. – 48! You still have to learn. I will, Mom. But when will you be back? Well, every weekend, and... maybe you'll come see me, too. Yeah, we'll see. But after you finish your school, you'll come back home, I hope. Yes. Your dad and I don't know yet what we'll do, but... We'll see in a few months, Paul. Come, Paul. Annie... Yes? I know it won't be easy between us, but... we'll see, ok? I love you.
