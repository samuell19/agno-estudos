Il vetro, pulire il vetro. What was that? The windscreen needs a wash. I know but the car's out of fluid. -Hello. -Hello. Can you fill her up, please? Wash the windscreen and refill the water spray. He came out of the woods like a mad man. I didn't have time to see him. Hello. Do you have two rooms in the name of Mr. Fontana and Mr. Meylan? Yes. Room 5 for Mr. Fontana and Room 9 for Mr. Meylan. Hello, madame. -Hello, sir. I'll show you the rooms. -Thanks. -Hello, sir. -Sir. I didn't imagine him like that, Fontana. Of course. On TV they only show their heads. What happened to him? An accident? You don't remember? Two years ago in Caracas? He was hit by a military truck. Everybody thought he'd had it. Ah yes, the putsch in Bolivia. Isn't Caracas in Venezuela? Where's he been? He's been gone six months. I think he worked at Radio Lugano for a long time. Come in. Are you playing the bagpipes? I'll explain. Look. Hang your shirt on that in the evening. And the next morning it's impeccable. Nice. Details. Detail. Pay attention to detail. If you don't, everything goes wrong. You'd be a model housewife. Shit! What's the matter? I forgot my razor. Everything going wrong? Do you want my electric shaver? No, I can't shave with that. Do you want some mustard? Missed, asshole. -Do you gentlemen want to eat outside? -No thanks. I'll eat tonight. I feel like a walk. -Do you want me to go with you? -No, no thanks. I need to re-read a few things… Don't you think his latest book is a little outdated? It's more than three years old. The statistics are outdated, but the analysis is still valid. -The meeting is at 4, isn't it? -Hm. Odette's. Closed on Mondays. Oh my word. That's Fontana! -Fonfon! -Where am I? Sorry, but Kremer's secretary phoned. He's sick, he can't see us today. Is it serious? I don't think so. Maybe he'll see us tomorrow. What impression did she make on the phone? I don't know… She was rather embarrassed. What a good start. On Sunday, at about 3:30 p.m. in the Auvernan woods, a car driven by Mr. Otto Schmidhauserer, a garage owner in Eviolaz they've spelled "Etiolaz" with a "v" hit a motorbike being ridden by Mr. Mario Ricci, a 32-year-old workman. Please may I have two beers and two sandwiches? -Outside? -Yes, please. The impact of the crash was very violent. The seriously injured motorcyclist has been taken to the Yverdon hospital. Poor guy! What terrible luck. How will you manage for the match? We'll go tomorrow to Bussigny to ask them for their center forward. On the building site they're saying Schmidhauseren was driving too fast. Schmidhauserer says he didn't ever exceed 110 km/h, but.. Puchal Pouilladier thinks he was driving at more than 130. -Yes? -A call for you, sir. -Ah, thanks. Pronto. Sì, Fontana. Good evening, miss. So you're saying you drive at 20 km/h in that straight through the woods? -No, but I'm careful. -Like hell! Of course, tomorrow then. Tomorrow 2:30. Yes, thanks. Good night. If someone comes out without looking, you have no time to brake even if you're driving slowly. Those crossroads are dangerous. Anyway, I never saw Shmidhaus drive at crazy speeds. You weren't there, were you? -Miss, could I have a mineral water? -At once, sir. -He broke his head open when he fell. -A helmet would have saved him. -He always wore a helmet. -That's not what the cops said. The cops came half an hour after the accident, you know? He was probably wearing it since nobody found it at work. What do you think, Gérard? Was he wearing it or not? I don't think so. And you, Ficelle, you didn't see anything either? I…I was sleeping in the car. You were sleeping it off. And Schmidhauser, what does he say? He says it happened so fast he couldn't see anything. And the young hairdresser, Sylvia? Did she see the accident? No, by the time she arrived, they had already taken him. -She had a meeting in the woods with Ricci? -I don't know, maybe. -They're all the same anyway. -How do you know, you had a look? That's not funny. -Strange we didn't find the helmet. -It probably flew into the ditch. At that speed anyway, with or without a helmet… -What do you know? -There were tire marks. That doesn't mean anything. If he wasn't guilty, he wouldn't have lost his license. You satisfied, you wop?! Nobody loved Schmidhauser on the site. Since the garage kicked them out on their ass, they can't go sniffing around his wife anymore. That's bullshit, Max. It's just malicious gossip. There's no smoke without fire. Go and tell Schmidhauser that. He'll be delighted. He'll thank you. -Pardon me. -It doesn't matter. You're here to make a film for television? No, not really. An interview with Professor Kremer. Do you know him? Yes, a little. He came to eat at the inn once. His secretary comes sometimes. Thanks. -Hello. -Hello sir. I'll only bother you on the days I forget my razor. You're not bothering me at all, sir. Hello Odette, hello sir. I'm sorry to disturb you. May I talk to you a moment? Of course. Will you excuse me one second, sir? What's the matter? I wanted to tell you: Sylvia won't be able to come in today. She's in Yverdon at the hospital, with Mario. -With Mario? -Yes. She didn't dare to tell you. Because she knew that Mario and you… It's nothing to do with you, anyway. Thanks for coming. Those birds you have here; are they red-headed Bengalis? They're splendid. Yes. Cathy! Where did you put the letter from Niroumbe? It's on the desk. No, it isn't. I don't know. I haven't touched it. But who tidies up? -You're lucky! -Yes. Yes. Shit. -You going? Come on. -No. Come in. Hello. -Henri! -Yes. The gentlemen from the television. -Hello gentlemen. -I'm Fontana. Hello professor. -Daniel Meylan, my right-hand man. -How do you do. -You've already met my assistant? -We have. -Come and sit down. -Thanks. What do you want to drink? I'll have some water, thanks. -And you, sir? -A light whiskey, with a lot of water. Do you like it here? It's restful. Ah yes, probably. But…don't you miss fieldwork? For a man of action like you. Yes, I do miss it, but sometimes… you need to make a break. How long has it been since your last book? Almost two years. Why? More and more people are starving in the world. 15 million children die every year worldwide. That's more than one every minute. But an investigator like you… in your field… does he have the right to give up hope? No… probably not. But still, the feeling of helplessness remains. You're not the only one. You have no reason to give up, Henri. You're invited all over the world to give your expert opinion. Governments invite me, but… they don't implement the solutions I propose. What… what should be done then? Sit down. Thanks. Excuse me. Do you want anything? No, thanks. He doesn't feel up to it yet. Is he writing anything? He tries. I think the best thing would be if he went back to fieldwork. There he'll feel fine again. Do you think he really wants to do this broadcast? Yes. He must do it. It'll be a very important step for him. I get the impression this won't be easy. She's a nice woman. Oh yes, the professor is a lucky man. She's pretty. -She's pretty in her way? -Yes. It looks like she has an iron constitution. Got a cigarette? Got a light? Do you think…? What? …they fuck every day? What do you think? I was just wondering. You want a drink? I don't want to come in. You want something anyway? A tea maybe. Two teas, please. I'm exhausted, I haven't slept since Sunday. They let you stay with him? Yes. What are the doctors saying? Oh, they don't want to say anything. I know perfectly well, he's had it. If I hadn't been late, it wouldn't have happened. You know you're not to blame. You couldn't do anything. It's not your fault, believe me. There were guests, a friend of my mother. I had to stay to give a hand. That's so stupid! Aren't you cold? I'm expecting a baby. -By Ricci? -Yes. Does your mother know? Attention, next Saturday, at the town stadium, football fair. Friendly match: FC Yverdon vs FC Etiolaz. In the evening after the match: a big dance with the group 'Blackstar', winter attractions, buffet lunch under the tent. How long have you known him? Two months. Why didn't you tell me? We didn't want to hurt you. You slept with him? Whore! We haven't done anything wrong. I'm such a fool! You probably had a lot of fun. No. He just didn't know how to tell you. Anyway, I'd never have believed you capable of such a thing. You're both bastards, that's what you are! Go and get the newspapers. Hello madame. It's the early-rising cripple. -Hello sir! -Hello. Mr. Bernard Fontana, aren't you? Edgar Simonet, deputy mayor. Ah, hello, excuse me. I saw you the other night at the Croix Fédérale, but I didn't want to bother you. -It's good to see you in our town. -Thanks. You're like an old friend to everybody. When we see you on TV, it's like watching a member of the family. That's my job. I've been told that you're preparing a report on Professor Kremer. An interview. And…may I ask what it's about? You know, Professor Kremer is a specialist on the problem of world hunger. I know. But what can one do? That's what I'd like to ask the professor. Some have too much, others not enough. One wonders what effect this will have. Yes, as you say. Hello, Mathilde! Hello, Edgar! -Hello, sir! -Hello, madame! How are you this morning? Fine, fine. Not very sunny today. It'll be better tomorrow. Has to be. Well, have a good day Mathilde. That poor woman won't last much longer. Tell me, Mr. Fontana. I don't know if you have time but we'd be delighted if you'd visit us at home one evening. Thanks. Whenever you wish. You already know my wife. She runs the hairdressing salon. Oh yes. See you then. Goodbye. Goodbye. Strange to think we won't see him again. He was a good player. Did you know he was getting engaged to the hairdresser girl? So I hear. It's the Italian who died on the road last Sunday. This one. He worked on the tunnel construction site. He'd just bought himself a motorcycle. The young girl's not lucky. They had hidden their secret well. He had to die so that it'd be known. Crazy, isn't it? Com'è tutto. -Buona notte. -Good night, sir. -Good night, sir. -Good night, sir. How long have you been painting? Since I arrived here. And…why painting? To keep the demons at bay. Turning towards the past? You know… A conscience about the past is not always a weakness, it's also a strength. A weapon which better equips us to… face the future. Yes, but between the past and the future… there's the present. Henri. Don't you think these gentlemen came to talk about the present? In that painting the notion of time doesn't exist. This isn't science anymore, one don't seep into the subject… one goes down… deep into oneself. But for a man of action, doesn't this mean… choosing inertia over change? At the moment you're choosing dreams over reality. You are the dream. Thank you. You were talking about inertia but… it's just a semblance of inertia. Let me show you something. What do you see in the reflection of this little mirror? A window, right? Switch off the light, please. Here. You see, the little mirror, so.. what can you see in the reflection? A window, isn't it? And in that window… we can see the town. In other words, we're traveling into the painting. So… there's no inertia. We see here… that the tiny… encompasses the large. Just as in physics. The infinitesimally small, the atom… contains the energy. You see then… that we're traveling through a world in which values are inverted. In that little round mirror lies the immensity of the city. It's an invitation to adventure; but it is motionless. And silent. Oddly enough, when I copy a Dutch master, whether it is… a home interior or a still life, I retrace the voyage of the artist and try to go beyond the experience sorry… the appearance… experience/appearance and find new energies. A return to basics. If I understand correctly, in moments of doubt, art rescues science. Don't get me wrong, I paint, but I'm not an artist. I just copy meticulously. -Hello, madame. -Excuse me. A telegram for the professor. It's a telegram for you. What's it about? It's another invitation to Ottawa's congress. You must go. I'm going into the village now. -See you. -Yes. Goodbye. Hmm. Professor Kremer, you're posing a serious problem for us. I don't know whether our subject should be Flemish painting or world hunger. It's up to you to decide. -Shit! -What are you doing? -Hello again! -What are you doing here? Cleaning it? It's the chain. Can we drive you somewhere? Yes, please. To the garage. Did your work session go well? I don't really know where we're going. But now anyway we know the Flemish painting a little better. Did he talk to you about it again? Yes. Like a master. Have we come at a bad time? No, on the contrary. It might help him. -Come back in half an hour. It'll be ready. -Okay. Thanks. The remains of my car. -Is it your car? -Yes. Mr. Schmidhauserer had an accident when he borrowed it last Sunday. Yes, I know. The motorcyclist is dead. He's dead!? Si, amico mio, I'm doing my best but we don't know now where we're going. We're beating around the bush. That's all. No need to send a unit tonight. Of course, we discussed this before. No, no. I.. We must try. The deadlock can still be broken. I'll call you tomorrow. Ciao. Miss Solange… You can rent the rooms tonight. My unit won't come before tomorrow. Good, Mr. Fontana. He likes Switzerland. He's already been here on holiday many times. I'd prefer to postpone the interview until Friday. I think it will be better for the professor. The producers didn't complain too much? They'll manage. I'm so sorry for the trouble. Oh, it's normal. The important thing is to end up with a good programme. He's going through a difficult time. Here, I thought he'd… feel better but.. in the end, the isolation's made him even worse. I have a feeling everything will be all right. You'll see. I hope so. Excuse me, I've got to go to the garage. -I'll drive you there. -Thanks. Assassino! Assassino! Sorry, sir. -Hello. -Hello. Odette isn't here? No, she's sick. -What's wrong with her? -I dunno. You're a brave girl coming to work this morning, my poor Sylvia. What a story! A Santal with added vitamins for dry hair, please. -Still 5.50? -Yes. By the way, how old was he? 28. That's not fair. How did the accident happen? Everyone's talking but, in fact, no one knows much. I don't know. I must go. Hang in there. Goodbye, sir. I hope the professor won't cop out again. The crew's coming tomorrow. I hope so. You see what they wrote? Oh yes, yes. They were the ones yelling last night. I didn't hear anything. -There was a shot too. -Really? They're going too far, aren't they? Yes. This country is at war. According to the World Health Organisation, 100 million people are suffering from bilharzia. In other words, 100 million people are pissing blood. 45 million Africans are affected by sleeping sickness. There are 11 million lepers. Of 120 million babies born every year, one in ten dies before his first birthday. In most cases, hunger is, either directly or… indirectly, the cause of this silent slaughter. And us? Us. In the meantime, what are we doing in the West? This winter, we're going to pay 30 francs for a kilo of beans imported from sub-Saharan Africa. The farmer who produces them earns 1 franc per kilo. The difference goes into the pockets of the middlemen; that is… the governments of the producing countries, importers, retailers, and… and, at the end of the chain, shopkeepers. As for the farmer: he's starving. I told you to… I told you to unplug it. Hello? No, il professore non c'è. Torna la settimana prossima Prego. It's about the Petition to Rome. They want your signature. I'm okay. You can call them. Good. When one listens to you, you don't seem discouraged. For 20 years I've kept repeating the same things. What's the use of talking… when one can't change anything? But you're still proposing solutions. To the problems caused by the demographic explosion, for example. Which are still in the boxes of governments. Ecco… The perfect time…for you to pull them out for us. Let's try. That was remarkable today. I just hope he'll be that good for the cameras tomorrow. -Is he used to…? -Yes, but he changes from one day to the next. Sometimes he loses interest in everything. He feels he's crying in the wilderness. Unfortunately, so are we. Goodbye. See you tomorrow. Ideally we'd be to go with him when he does fieldwork. Who'll pay for that? I know. -Hello. -Hi. Hey, Rosset, have you seen what those guys wrote on the front of the garage? Yes, I saw. Haven't they got some nerve? Ricci was their friend. That's no reason to call Schmidhauser a murderer, for God's sake! Let them go muck up the walls in their own country if they want, but don't let them fuck everything up here! Cut the crap, Edouard! They're in the fucking shit all day building your tunnel. It'll all end up badly if they continue to yell under his windows. Next time he won't shoot into the air. They'll calm down. Believe me. Sorry, I've forgotten the knife. Assassino. -Hello, sir. -Hello. You are Mr. Fontana, aren't you? That's because I've known you. With TV and all that, for a long time. What do you mean "for a long time"? You look so young. The first time I heard you was on the radio. Your program about Amazonia was really great. Do you remember that program? Yes, in '72. 1972. What a memory! It's easy for me. I had it taped. I received a cassette recorder for my tenth birthday. Good. Take care. Are you a student? I just finished technical college. Do you live in Turin? Yeah. I live with my father. He owns the sawmill. Assassino! They've got a grudge against the garage owner. Yeah. -Goodbye, sir. -Goodbye. If the Italians don't play, we'll get thrashed, no question. Not necessarily. We can find substitutes. Who? With two still on holiday, that's still five players short. We'll find some youngsters. Let Schmidhauser get his gun! Let him shoot them in the balls, the bastards! You're keeping quiet over there, Campana! When you're alone, you're a fucking babbler. Cheers! Watch out, you sneak! Tone it down, Francis. You, Barbezat, you don't care! They could spray your bistro with shit, and you'd still be a chicken. As long as you sell them your wine. Francis, you'd better get some sleep. Everything is for those bastards now! Goddamn it! Is this our country?! Yes or no?! Shit! It sure served your friend right, Campana. What? Forget it, Aldo. He's sloshed. -Francis, aren't you ashamed? -Kaputt! Let him come now. Watch him screw the girls! Cut that shit out! -Fuck off, you wanker! -Hey, fuck off yourself! -Enough now! -Fucking fed up with this mafia! That's all crap. What's it got to do with you? It's to do with the fact… it bothers me. Who is this moron? Just shut up or get out, Francis. Don't push me! I won't let this cripple fuck with me! Give him a strong coffee, it'll calm him down. Stop it now! -Get out now, Francis! -Don't touch me! You can call the cops! I'll piss up their asses. Okay then, tell them yourself. -Get out now, Francis! -Don't touch me! -Get out out at once then. -If I want! No one gives orders to Francis! Shit! What's happening in here? Why do you let him drink like this? Don't you know him?! -Never mind, Suzanne! Don't behave like an idiot, Francis. What's the use? Be calm, Francis, come on! Come. Lift up your legs. We're going to bed. Fuck anyway! -It's our country, yes or no? -Sure, sure. Come on. We'll be as well at home, won't we? Come on. Fucking damned bastard! I pay my taxes, Fernand! We know that, Francis. Bastards! I'll give you some assassino. He's tricky when he's drunk but… he's not a bad person. Well, I better go. They act dumb when they've been drinking. Francis is a special case. He never could hold down a job. Maybe that's why he hates everyone. He worked for while on the tunnel, but they fired him. Anyway, misunderstandings often occur on both sides. The tunnel workers are calling the garage owner a murderer. And they haven't got any proof. That's right. I'm tired all of sudden. Do you want a drink? I'd love a glass of white wine. I hope wine doesn't make you aggressive. I'm not quiet. If need be, I've got this to protect myself. I haven't had any news from my daughter for four years. Doesn't she ever write you? No. She's married to a French engineer, and they live in the north. She's leading her own life. She hasn't any reason to see me. She lives in another world. With my job, you know… What about her father? He was a truck driver. Always traveling here and there. More there than here? Yes. It didn't last long between us. He left after three years. Oh, he wasn't a bad man, not at all! He always paid child support. And he visited her every fortnight at her boarding school. And you? Do you see your children? They're adults. 21 and 23. But do you see them? They have their own lives… But yes, of course. Excuse me. Will you have a drink with us? No, thanks. -Good night. -Good night. -You'll have problems tomorrow. -Why? I didn't steal anything. I paid for the meat. Good night, Miss Solange. Good night, Mr. Fontana. Everything's okay, Solange? Yes, yes. I'm fine. Not everything's funny, is it? Why me? Because…I like you. Do you pity me? What an idea! They'd be really surprised to see us. Who? Everybody. Should we stop? No. We're in a hurry. In most cases, it's hunger, whether directly or indirectly, which is the cause of this silent slaughter. -By weakening the capacities… -Cut. -Uh, we're just changing the reel. -Okay. Is it going okay? So far… -He looks so young without his beard. -Yes. Thanks. -Is it going okay so far? -If it's okay for you. In fact, my feeling is that what's frightening… what scares us more than anything… is the realization that… absolutely everything's doomed to failure, even the most generous initiatives. And the fairest. Since we're still talking, I'd like to ask you if the investigators, the researchers feel responsible in some way for that failure? Of course they do. All I've done… leads me to better understand today what I haven't done or… couldn't do. Do you want a drink? At first, you don't notice and then… little by little it becomes so vast, it overwhelms us. It's true, I did everything I wanted. I published hundreds of articles, more than 20 books. My work's been translated into every language. It's true, I… how can I put it? the… the fame… The most important statesmen consulted with me. Shit. Nevertheless, my feeling is that I have totally failed. No, no. I have been wrong. I've deceived myself. And I've often deceived others. I've uselessly repeated… the same things. I'm finished. No. You're not finished! After 40 years of reflection, work-field investigations, daily struggles, relationships with the most wretched part of the world, one has to admit that… …nothing has changed. -That's not true, Henri. Most of my solutions haven't been implemented, or are no more than ideas. For those who have nothing, the situation has never been so bleak. Today… Everything… has to be done all over again. Everything needs to be… rethought regarding the relationship we have with others… and in my own life. And I'm unable to do that now. I'm living like a ghost, I… I'm playing myself in a comedy with the… Flemish painting. I'm losing contact. In fact, everything smells like hospitals or death. I thought I'd find peace here but I'm just… going around in circles, climbing the walls, I… I'm trapped in a tailspin. But… I'm going round in circles and there's no way out. You're not alone. You have people around you who love you. Stop, stop! -We're ready. -Thanks. -What do you want? -Nothing, nothing. -What's the matter? -Nothing, it's fine. -You're coming out, then? -No, no. You can't do this to them. Tell them to get out! Henri, open the door. No! No chance. Do you think it's screwed? What now, Fonfon? Are we going home? No, I'm invited to see the deputy mayor tonight. Ah! -Maybe we can get something from what we have. -Thanks, Roger. We've already heard his claptrap about hunger 100 times! Well, this'll make it 101 times. I recorded him when he began to talk rubbish. Give me the tape later. Solange is being given hell in the kitchen. I'm not sure but it seems she slept with a guest last night. Barbezat wants to fire her. He says that La Croix Fédérale is not a brothel. If we can't even fuck, what's left? Fonfon! Listen, try to calm down. It's Cathy. She'd like to see us. Hello, yes, I'm here. I've got a feeling she's drunk. What should we do? Tell her to come to the football field. We could meet you at the football field if you want. Okay. See you. Are you stressed? Yes, no… You are not going to freak out like Kremer? There are no bathrooms to escape to in here. You'll have to be careful with Cathy. Why? Because… she's not doing well at the moment either. Hello. He's sleeping. He's taken some pills. He's good for a 3 hour sleep. I've had it. I can't stay there alone any longer. -Do you understand? -Of course I do. I had to talk to someone. I couldn't stay there alone anymore. I've left everything for him. I thought I could help him in his work but I just get bored planting salads! I thought I'd be useful in other ways. All this for nothing. For nothing! He's so wonderful apart from that. Cathy, go for a ride. You'll feel better. Take the car, I'll walk back. And don't forget to bring me a salad. -Chi è? -It's me. Ah, come in. Were you sleeping? No. What time are we seeing the deputy mayor? Did you drive Cathy back? Yes. Has she recovered? Yes, no problem. You think she fucks every day? Don't start. Be careful. You'll kill this man if you steal his girl. I don't need a sermon, especially from you. And…even if I do sleep with her, -Isn't she old enough to decide? -No. If one day you have to do another interview with Kremer. How will you do it? Like that? You jerk! Your moralizing's pissing me off. 8 o'clock at the deputy mayor's. I heard you have some trouble. Yes, well… He wants to fire you? That's what he says. -I can talk to him if you want. -Certainly not, Mr. Fontana. It's not his business. Besides…he's yelling but he won't do anything. Don't worry. Mr. Barbezat… I'll keep the room another night. My assistant will too, I think. Very good. -Do you at least have a key to get in? -Yes, we have one. Yes. We're very grateful that you came, Mr. Fontana. We've had a wonderful evening. And our thanks to you, Mr.…? Meylan. I'm sorry. I haven't been on form. Everybody can be ill, honey. You have. Thanks. That was… more than perfect. That was… -Thanks. -Thanks. Goodbye. We are all… cuckolds. Yes! We're all cuckolds. We're all damned old. Yes, damned old. The Kremers, the professors… The children at the altars… you and me… the dear viewers… and every preacher… Why didn't you tell me Simonet was a cuckold? Because… you didn't ask. Didn't I? You could have said so anyway. -Come on. -Yes. The dissemblers, tutti gli sfondatori, gli… Eh sì! -I can't understand a word. -It doesn't matter, non importa. -Ciao bello. -Ciao. goodnight, my… Shit! Need a hand? -Hello, Sylvia. -Hello. Mario's brother is outside. He'd like to see you. -Hello, have a seat. -Thanks. Asshole! -Fuck, you're hurting me! -Sorry, sir. Excuse me. Hello, sir. Hello. Did they hurt you? You'll be in a fine state tonight if you go on like this. -Do you want a drink? -A cognac, please. Pardon me, miss, is the boss here? No. Why? My friend would like to buy the photograph of the team. He's Mario Ricci's brother. I don't know. The boss is at the fair. But… …his bus is leaving in minutes. Dice che non può farci niente. Il padrone è alla festa del paese, e lei non vuole prendersi la responsabilità. Take it, we'll see! Dice che puoi prenderla. Thanks a lot. How much? 50 francs? Thanks very much. You wanted to tell me something? -Yes. -Sit down. Thanks. So? Well, I… I wanted your advice about something… rather serious. Serious? Solange! Can I pay, goddamn it!? -Be polite, Jacky! -Yes, darling. Stéphane, what the fuck are you doing? -Come on, we're pushing off. -I'm coming. Excuse me, sir… I'll come back later. You were going to snitch, you bastard! Don't talk crap! -What's the matter? -Nothing, it's fine. -You coming out then? -No, no. You can't do this to them! Tell them to get out! Henri! Open the door. No. Come in. -Have you listened to the tapes? -Yes. We haven't even got 20 good minutes. There is perhaps a solution. We could complete it with other accounts. What do you think? We'll do whatever is best. They have some problems too. It seems that the Italians won't play because of the guy who died. What are you doing? Going home? Cathy told me they'd been invited to the fair. It'll depend on Kremer. You don't feel like going home then? Do you? Isn't that Kremer? He's a strange guy anyway. No. Maybe he's going to the fair too. The absence of De Bust is no reason to withdraw your support. I'm not withdrawing my support. But they'll hammer us! We'll look like idiots! We play for pleasure, Maurice. That's what matters. Don't charge the spectators then! And don't charge them money to see the new changing rooms. What do you want? To cancel the match? You certainly would have eaten 80kg of sausages! I would have made the bastards who got us into this shit eat them all. Can't they go into mourning for their friend? They can but they should have informed us first. They wanted to spoil the fair, that's obvious! Anyway, the fair is about more than just football. Hello, sir. You see that boy? He wants to tell me something but he keeps bottling it. Cathy! -Good evening. -Good evening. -Good evening. -Good evening. I won't be long. I just came to tell you that… I must go home. I have to be there when he wakes up. He's still in a state of… Sometimes. You have time for a drink? No. That's a pity. When do you leave? Tomorrow morning. I'll come and say goodbye. Goodbye. I'll walk with you to your bike. Can we talk now? I don't know, I… So, what is it? It's about Ricci's accident. The garage owner isn't guilty. Did you see the accident? No, I didn't. But I know. I was there. I really don't understand. You were there and didn't see anything? I didn't see the crash but I heard it. We were in the woods with friends last Sunday. We saw his bike by the path. We stopped to have a look at it. It was new. Ricci came running up. He told us off. Then a fight started. I tried to separate them. He took the opportunity to ride off. Then they chased him with the jeep. I stayed behind. Was it them? You're disgusting! Goddamn! -Shit! -Have you seen your friend, Stéphane Coutard?-No why? Because he told me something serious. Then he disappeared. What did he tell you? He told me about the ride you had in the woods last Sunday. Don't you think it's time to go and talk to the garage owner? What's it got to do with you? It's got to do with you. A man is dead. And until now only the garage owner has been accused. We're not guilty! -We had some fun, that's all! -No. That's not what Stéphane Coutard told me. What did he tell you? He told me you had a fight with the Italian and that you chased him. Prove it. Come, Gégé! We don't talk to cops. I don't know if I'm a cop, but I know that despite your big mouth and your big arms, you're a coward of a kind I've rarely met. You prick, don't push me! Come on, Gégé, we'll find that little bastard. You're going back? -You a goalkeeper? -Not exactly. -I have a message for you, Mr. Fontana. -Ah, thanks. Coutard's son left it here less than half an hour ago. I don't have my glasses. Can you read it? I betrayed my friends. You'll find me at the Pré aux Moines. Sorry. -Where is the Pré aux Moines? -I don't know. Do you know, Alex? I don't. Come on. -Do you know the Pré aux Moines? -Yes, sir. -Well, you're coming with me. -Yes, sir. Stay here. Don't mess about, Gégé, goddamn it! You'd better watch yourself! Are you sick or something?! You're crazy! That's enough! Stop it, Jacky! Stop! I'll kill you! Do it, then! We'll meet again. You're all against me. Is it far? No, just up ahead. How did it start? I had just got on the bike for fun. And when Ricci saw me, he got angry and he threw me to the ground. Where did Ricci come from? I don't know. Probably from the Pré aux Moines. At the beginning the fight was not serious. But then Vermot came. And Coutard? Stéphane tried to separate us. And Ricci took the opportunity to flee. And you followed him. Yes. That's where the accident took place. -You chased him? -Yes. That was just to frighten him. And then he died. Wait for me here. Coutard? Where are you, Coutard? So. You play at climbing? Do you think that'll help? So, come down! I won't spend the night here. I'm cold, I'm tired. Come down. Allora! Simonet! -Come and fetch him. -Yes, sir. Come, come. What'd be the use of topping yourself? He'll go with you. Both of you go and talk to the garage owner. Do you hear? Go together. Yes, sir. E basta! The young boy was lucky you were there, and you didn't miss him! He's stupid. You see? She came. Yes, I see. You're up early. I had promised. Sorry I look strange. I took a knocking last night. -Goodbye. -Goodbye. Kremer agreed to go to the Congress of Ottawa. Is she going with him? Yes. Look ahead.
