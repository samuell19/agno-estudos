[ Laughing ] [ Man ] Andre, you're mad! You're mad! Oh, Je-- No, no, no! No! No! No! Aah! Oh, shit. Oh, sorry, Captain. I didn't recognize you. Anything serious? Oh, usual business. Carry on. Suppose I'm the force now. [ Siren Wailing ] [ Boy ] Come on! ** [ Festive Pop ] Hey. Hey. Shh! ** [ Stops ] Come here, guys. Come, come, come. [ Clears Throat ] Andre. - Oh, no, no, no, no. - [ Men Shouting, Laughing ] Hold it-- [ Clearing Throat ] There you are. All right, um, I would like to toast my best friend, Andre... Yeah! Cheers. who has had the good fortune to marry the most beautiful woman in our country. In all Africa! Excuse me. Sorry. I stand corrected. He's had the good fortune-- - You've said that. - 'Cause it's worth repeating, you lucky bastard. - You get to marry her twice. - [ All Laughing ] Do not screw it up this time. Okay? You're getting a second chance at this. So just enrich our numbers with some new Stander blood! - Hip-hip! - Hooray! - Hip-hip! - Hooray! [ All Shouting, Laughing ] Yes! Oh, yes! You are bastards! Bastards all of you! Where are you, Andre? With you on a beach. But we're 18. It's America. Fort Lauderdale. [ Laughing ] Rock and roll is playing. We're running through the surf. And have you lost our hotel keys yet? I'm gonna take you back there. You're crazy. I will. You'll see. You're crazy. [ Shutter Clicks ] All I need is you. I want it to be different now, Bekk. I need you to help me this time. I need you to tell me I won't get sucked back into the muck. You can do it, Andre. Just promise me that whatever undercover crime-infested hippie drug den you find yourself in... that I'll be there. In your thoughts, I mean. Promise. Hah! [ Bekkie Laughing ] No! [ Both Laughing ] [ Squeals, Continues Laughing ] Hey. Hey. [ Grunting ] [ Siren Wailing, Faint ] [ Man Speaking On Radio, Faint ] [ Man ] Bad business, Andre. Single woman. She's about 32. Dead maybe 8 or 10 hours. It's clearly murder, but there's no motive we can make out. Wounds are vicious. Looks like a serrated edge. Think she knew the guy? There's no signs of forced entry. Not much of a struggle either. We'll need shots of the bedroom as well. And check the bathroom door and the taps for prints. Where's the child? She had a girl, maybe 5 years old. Any sign of her? That child was here last night. We have a murder-kidnapping. And if we don't move fast, that list will grow. I'll get you the reports-- You're in charge, Cor. Get used to it. I've got a date with my wife. [ TV: Reporter ] In the wake of rioting... which broke out in Soweto two days ago, violence continues to erupt in townships... with students organizing protests... against Afrikaans as the language of instruction. In Tembisa, a number of schools and administration buildings have been torched. Municipal beer halls and liquor stores have been burned down... and police have erected roadblocks at all township entrances. While the anti-urban terrorism unit continues to patrol the townships, all members of the police force have been placed on riot duty alert. A number of arrests have been made. What is going to happen, Andre? The Department of Bantu Education... has closed all schools in Soweto and Alexandra. [ Dog Barking, Faint ] [ Baby Wailing, Faint ] [ People Chattering ] [ Man Speaking Afrikaans ] Shotgun. What's this? Live rounds today, no extra charge. Courtesy of the general. Too many of you caught changing the rubber for D-cells anyway. [ Man Continues In Afrikaans ] [ Man Shouting Commands In Afrikaans ] I can feel it, Andre. It's a bad day. Don't, Cor. It'll be fine. It's Rita. If anything happens to me-- Of course. And you'll do the same for me with Bekkie, huh? Yeah. [ Man Shouting In Zulu ] Amandla!

It's all right! Come on! Come on! It's all right. It's all right. It's all right. It's all right. [ Coughs ] Harold told me you was coming. Why do the wrong ones keep dying, Pa? I shot a man today. [ Sighs ] [ Speaking In Afrikaans ] Speak English, Dad, please. If you hadn't shot him, what then? The riots would continue, sir. And then? Maybe they would take power. Eventually they will. They would kill us, those of us who stayed. Wouldn't they? Maybe they're not like us. This country would become like the rest of Africa-- impoverished, disease-ridden, corrupt. Popular leaders who murder their own people, steal millions from the treasury... and then go off to die of cancer in Swiss clinics. Our blacks have the highest standard of living on the continent. Son, you helped the Africans today-- By murdering unarmed men? Unless you call this a weapon? [ Man ] You can't avoid riot duty, Stander. No one likes it. Some of them do. Let them do it. You've discussed this with your father? He has nothing to do with this. Yes. Riot squad is an important part of your duty, like it or not. And asking to be relieved from it-- You're making a good name for yourself. You're the youngest captain in the force. You know what this will mean to your career. I realize what this will mean to me, sir. ** [ Man Singing, Faint: Punk ] ** [ Headphones: Singing Continues ] [ Sighs ] For God's sake. [ Loud ] * To you ** [ Stops ] Sorry. Didn't mean to wake you. Don't you do this to me. Don't you dare shut me out. It's me. [ Panting ] I wasn't defending myself. I wasn't defending my family. The only thing I maybe might have been defending... was my own-- What? Reputation. And even then, it's not mine. Saving Stander face. Holding up my end. Which is a bullshit excuse... for my shooting people, killing people. You've got to stop this. You know, the truly amazing thing is-- amazing-- don't even feel worse than I do. Please... just-- Don't. Please don't. Oh, for Christ's sake. Where the hell is everyone? They've all been called up. That bomb in Soweto. They have to enforce a curfew. And meanwhile we let everything go to shit here. You know, a white man could get away with anything today, while the police are too busy crushing the blacks! [ Ringing ] [ Door Opens ] Coming for lunch, sir? Terrifically busy. Thank you. [ Man ] Newspaper. Newspaper. Newspaper. Newspaper. Newspaper. Newspaper. Paper, paper, paper. ** [ Radio: Man Singing ] [ Woman ] Hey! Hey, excuse me! Did you see what he did? [ Cocks Gun ] He just comes barging in, pushing past. Jesus! I mean, we're a queue here. We are all waiting. You're not the only one in a hurry. What if we all did that, eh? It would be a bit of a mess, wouldn't it? I don't know. After all, this is a bank. - You're supposed to behave yourself. - [ Bell Dings ] Some gentleman! No. No. No, no, no. He was wearing-- wearing a blue suit... and, um, big sunglasses on his face, big sunglasses. He had big sunglasses and-- and a blue suit. Yes, I think-- [ Boy Shouting ] [ Shouting Continues ] You can drop these at lunchtime tomorrow. I'll be in meetings all day. And what are these? [ Gasps ] [ Chuckles, Laughing ] What's got into you? I blew off some steam. That's all I needed. It won't happen again. If these are to make up for a week of nothing but trouble, you can keep your roses. But it might cost you the Bolton. Oh, no. [ Both Laughing ] ** [ Man Singing, Ethereal, Indistinct ] [ Chuckles, Pants ] [ Man ] It'll only take two men. I didn't believe him. Only two men. He said, yeah, two men and a hundred blacks. [ Man #2 Laughing ] A hundred kaffirs. [ Laughing Continues ] [ Man #2 ] That's rich. [ Man #1 ] What about one man and 200 kaffirs, huh? [ Both Laughing ] Bring it in. We'll take care of it for you. - Thanks very much. - Thank you. Going around the corner! [ Children Shouting ] [ Pleading Shouts ] So, he showed the teller the gun, and apparently threatened to blow his head off if he didn't hand over the money. [ Stander ] Anyone else hear that? Uh, no. Apparently they were quite busy at the time. And then he exited through the front of the bank, went into the street. The security guard pursued him, but lost him immediately. Any description? Evidently the same good looker that hit the first bank. Put out an alert and stake out the downtown banks. All right. Thanks, guys. The '68 Nederburg. [ Sighs, Laughs ] All right. Go ahead. Oh! Oh. And two of them, Andre. It's beautiful. They're beautiful. We can't-- We can't afford these. There were old assets in my family. I decided it was time to cash in. Well, you certainly did. It's time you had something as lovely as you are. Tell me everything's all right. Everything's all right. Nothing solid. He keeps his head down, seems to know where the cameras are. Generic-- six foot, suit, red hair. Red? Probably a disguise. Yeah. Right. I know. It's been a bad day. You okay now? I'm sure, miss, you've been through this over and over, but could you tell me exactly what you saw? - You. - Me? I mean-- [ Chuckling ] I-I don't know what I mean. It's just he was, you know, like you. Want to take me in, Captain? [ All Laughing ] I don't know. Some kind of satisfaction. Fame, maybe? Well, he's got our attention. I'll give him that. He keeps pushing, raising the stakes, upping the ante. He's probably contemplating something daring next. Something big. The airport. The foreign exchange windows. Morning flight arrivals. A thousand foreigners, exchanging dollars, pounds, marks. The airport, really? That's a stretch. Maybe. But I got a feeling about this bugger. A very strong feeling. Take a team, Cor. Stake it out. Okay. Yes, that is a firearm, but I don't intend to use it. Give me all your money. Captain Deventer? What? Three? In an hour? [ Man ] We just got these in. [ Chuckles ] He's one smooth oak. [ Sirens Wailing ] Something on your mind, Cor? You know, Andre, if you want to get away, just you and Bekkie, just to let things settle away from this madness, I'll cover for you, as long as it takes. I'll keep that in mind. As a friend, hey, we all need a change of scenery. [ Rifles Cocking ] [ Cor ] Captain Stander. Sir, you are under arrest. I'll have to have your gun, Andre. We've had a 90-man team on you, Andre. What took you so long? I'm not as good as you. [ Sighs ] You've gotten better. [ Chuckles ] Could you please just turn around and put your hands behind your back, please? [ Handcuffs Locking ] [ Man On TV ] The state of bank robberies plaguing the Johannesburg area... could finally come to an end with a surprising arrest. The suspect in the so-called "White Collar Robber Case" has been captured. In a startling turn of events, an arrest was made of none other than Johannesburg police Captain Andre Stander. The extent of the captain's alleged involvement in the robberies on the Reef... is not determined at this time, though 28 charges are pending. Among them are several counts of robbery, attempted murder, fraud, illegal possession of firearms, forgery and pottering. More news after this. I have three sons who do motorcycle riding. Their clothes are just caked in mud. [ Man ] Does the defense have witnesses? [ Man #2] Uh, none. Then do you have a statement, Captain Stander, before I consider judgment? I'm tried for robbing banks. But I have killed unarmed people. [ Murmuring ] That is not the business of this court. Do you have anything more to say? No. "The court only attaches importance... "to the accused's reckless endangerment of innocent people... "that he had sworn to his country to protect. "No account is taken of his prior record and commendations. The court sentences former Captain Andre Stander to 32 years imprisonment." [ Spectators Murmuring ] Dirty fucking Harry. He won't last long. Really? Who's got the balls? You, Lee? [ Door Closing ] [ Lock Locking ] [ Lee ] Hey! That psycho kidnapper will be out before you. How does that make you feel, supercop? Lee McCall. I used to hit banks... back home in Australia. [ Man #2 ] You're not Australian, you bastard. Sing the national anthem, then. [ Lee ] * Wallaby and Kangaroo * Will ever runnin' be free and... true-- ** I'm fuckin' no Australian-- Lee McCall. You've been inside 11 of the last 12 years. Bad checks, stolen cars, credit cards. Small-time habitual. Hit the bank? You've never even had an account. Why, it sounds like you know me. Your file crossed my desk... once. "The car must stay full of petrol. "Ask my father to please empty my treasure chest and put the money in the boot, "shift the seat back please, Bekk, I may be handcuffed. "I feel like the lowest of the low for asking you these things. Or are you enjoying the adventure?" - How did he get it past them? - Oh, he didn't. A friend of mine slipped it to me before the press got hold of it. He's a flight risk now. One letter a month, no visitation rights. - Would you have helped him? - Of course. If he had been caught, the appeal would have been denied. Bekkie, I may be selfish, but that is the only hope I have of seeing him out before I die. Please. Don't encourage him. Oh, Bekkie. There are parts of Andre I'm afraid we'll never know. You didn't marry him twice. [ Stander's Voice ] My friend, Cor. After two years in here, I am an honest man. I no longer worry that I'm living a lie. I have more respect for the sorted criminals I find myself amongst... than I did for the cops I used to know. Thugs, bullies, cut-up buggers... smoking stolen cigars at my very own wedding. Robbed goods paid out in the name of so-called protection. I'd rather rob a bank than accept a gift that was given out of fear. Oh, not for me. I've got a half shoulder. Parachuting accident. Right. How do you spell parachute? Eh? I don't know. [ Man Shouting ] [ Stander ] Hey, asslicker! Brownnoser! I'm on to you. - I want to take a trade test. - Who gives a shit? On the 31st. Outside these walls. Outside. Really? You're soft. I think you've lost your nerve. I don't need to prove myself to you. I was robbing banks years before you. I robbed my first bank with my finger. With your finger? Yeah. Really? Really. You swine. See, I was born to it. Chaos. It's all I know. Well, Allan, when I get out, maybe I'll come back and get you. Thank you, but, uh, that's not how I see it, Andre. When I get out, I'll come back and get you. You hear that, McCall? What? - Heyl thinks he'll beat us to it. - Huh? - [ Chattering ] - Scrum up! - Engage! - [ Grunting ] - [ Whistle Blowing ] - Oh, God! Your mother balls! Fuckin' does cop broke my fuckin' arm! [ Groaning ] Get off! - [ Shouting ] - [ Whistle Blowing ] - [ Whistle Blowing ] - [ Shouting Continues ] Get off! Get up, boys! Break it up! Break it up! Come on, break it up! [ Groaning ] Let's check your mobility. Hey! I'm looking at 30 more years here. Do you think I care if I live or die? How about your friend? Does he care? Does his wife? His kids? [ Whimpers ] Come on, give me that! Give it! You too! Come on! You fat boy! Give me the gun! Lay on the ground! [ Lee ] Move! Now why don't you be a good ou and take these off of me. [ Stander ] Now. Tell me about your cars. Lee, come on. [ Speaking Foreign Language ] You did fine, son. Just fine. [ Speaking Foreign Language ] [ Foreign Language ] Is this yours, Granddad. This yours, is it? I'll take this. [ Sighs ] Nothing more up-to-date? [ Knocking ] Get in here! Thank you for coming. [ Siren Blaring ] Pull over! Pull over! Please step out, Miss. I didn't know about it! [ Groans ] This way. Is there a problem? No problem. I would have gone with them! Thank you for your cooperation. [ Phone Ringing ] - Guten tag. - [ Yelling ] It's Andre. He's done it. Good afternoon, sir. Good afternoon. Do you see that gentleman behind me? He's my second. He's here to make sure that after I leave, you don't do anything stupid. Fill it up. You're a lovely woman. * Well, I take whatever I want to * * And, baby, I want you * [ Phone Ringing ] ...previously convicted in a series of bank robberies, escaped today from custody. [ Ringing ] It is suspected that the precisely executed escape... was planned by Stander... [ Ringing ] with the assistance of Patrick Lee McCall. Both men were wearing disguises. [ Ringing ] [ Ringing ] [ Line Ringing ] [ Ringing ] If that is you Andre, then I trust that God will help me to do the right thing. [ Lee ] I'll bet they're pulling out all the stops to find us. I can tell you what they're doing right now. They're sitting in a meeting in Jo'Burg. Smoking fat cigars. Trying to figure out how to handle this without making themselves look... even more witless than they already are. Bastards. Oh, no, you can't be serious. You're next. Nah. There's no need. Cops have got nothing on me. No photos, nothing. You lying shit, man. [ Grinding ] Lie down! Lie down! Lie down! Allan! Allan! Outside the walls, Allan. Trade test is over. Let's go. Lee. Nice to see you. Whoo-hoo! [ Laughing ] I'm Peter Grey. I'm very pleased to meet you. [ Laughing ] Kenny Roberts. Brandon Clayton! Pleasure! You swine! Now, where to, my Chinas? Now what do we do? We fuck with the system, we crumble its foundations and capitalize on the new disorder. What the fuck is that supposed to mean? It means we rob every bank between here and the other side of Jo'Burg. - [ All Laughing ] - Whoo! Whoo! Sir? - It's empty. - Fill it. Fill it. Quickly. The bank's money or yours? [ Man ] Help! Anybody help! We've just been robbed! Careful they got a gun, eh! [ Shouting ] I think it is, eh? Do you-- Do you mean we've been robbed by Andre Stander? Uh, yes, sir. Oh! Hey! We've been robbed by Andre Stander, eh! [ Murmuring ] Andre Stander! Oh, that's something, eh? Yeah. We'll just need you to-- The rent will be collected on the first of each month. The water is included but not electricity. And we expect the house to be kept in a clean condition. Of course. Do you have any references, Mr. Clayton? How about 2,000 rand, cash? The best for my friends. [ Whistling ] Tell me, sir, uh, which side do you dress? Uh, well, I usually just pull them straight up like that. Jesus! We look like bank presidents, not bank robbers! Then, we'll need some wheels to match, eh! [ Alarm Ringing ] [ Shouting ] Wait! Stop! Extremely high-powered, more than capable of 180, not that I've tried it personally. But the Targa is the classic Porsche. There are only four in the country, Mr. Marshall-- It is Mr. Marshall, isn't it? This is the only one in this particularly bright, vibrant color of canary yellow-- Where the fuck are you going, man? I'm just going! Speed, man. That's how they got you. You pushed it too far. If you go fast enough, you can't see where you've come from. I just think treating him like any other criminal won't work. Any other criminal wasn't Captain of Detectives. If we act like we're desperate to apprehend Stander, it makes us only look like we're scared of him. Aren't we? He's one man. We're the damned government. Well, now he's three-- Well, whatever. Bring him in. Quietly. We are in control here, goddamn it! As you say, sir. Morning, cowboy. You're good at collecting money. Give us a hand, eh? Hi. Come on. Come on. Move it! Hey, lady. Sit down. Back off, huh? Thank you. Excuse me. Fill her up. - Oh! - That's good. Zip it up. Zip it up. Okay. Very good. Do they pay you much? Twenty seconds. Took 7,000 in cash. But I knew all about their other robberies, so-- There's 25,000 rand in there. [ Chuckles ] [ Woman On Radio, Indistinct ] A downtown bank manager has reported that due to his foresight, the gang missed a substantial sum hidden in a secondary safe. Oh! Allan. It's 52 degrees on the Reef. In case you have a short memory, this is a fucking robbery. Three banks were robbed in the Johannesburg area today. One of them, twice. Andre Stander, the mastermind, brazenly returned to the bank... and allegedly robbed a second set of its contents. Peace in Lebanon is up for debate as the U.S. and France-- It must be hard on you, boss? Yeah. It is. Very kind of you to ask, Harold. [ Woman On TV ] The latest on the Stander gang, is that Andre Stander look-a-like, Mr. Mark Jennings, has been arrested for the third time. Mr. Jennings spoke to our reporter today upon his release. I can't walk in the streets, I can't do my business. I've been arrested three times as a Stander and not one apology. Not one! Just this morning-- Oh, poor bugger. His 15 minutes used up. It's enough to drive anybody crazy. Do you fancy going out and stealing a car? [ Wind Chime Clanging ] [ Sighs ] - [ Giggling ] - [ Chattering Softly ] [ Woman Laughing ] Hey! Hey, Andre! Andre! She's cool! She's my woman! I love her! Every time you fuck you fall in love! You understand. You're one of us now. You fuck up, you give us to the cops, you're dead! Like that. [ Door Slams ] [ Sighs ] That was nice. She'll turn on us, she'll turn on him... the first time she's pushed. Hey, don't take any notice of him, huh? He's just jealous 'cause you're my chickie, eh? Come here, my little Talia. Don't worry. Come on. Tarzan take you back to bed now. Huh? [ Giggling ] I've been in twice. She's seen me too much. You do this one, you two. She has a lot of firepower at her fingertips, Andre. [ Stander ] It'll be easy. Lee, you distract her. Send her to the back for Beretta rifles. Allan, hop over the counter, ready for her return. Don't worry, Allan. I'll protect you. [ Chuckles ] [ Woman ] May I help you? Do you have any Beretta rifles? Uh, yes. Yes, we do. Would you like the deluxe or standard? [ Lee ] Right. And so, what's the difference? Well, the deluxe is checkered, the standard isn't. - Checkered meaning? - It's like an engraving. [ Lee ] Oh, is it? [ Woman ] Yeah. Well, I think then, uh, probably the deluxe is what I'm looking for. All right. Let me just check the back for you. Right. Great, thank you. Fuck! It's glass. Hop over the counter. Fuck! [ Lee Chuckling ] It's in the fucking details, Andre. What are you laughing at? My pants are too tight. [ Laughing ] [ Gasping ] Oh, shit! [ Moaning ] [ Moans ] Easy. Easy. Easy. - What-- - [ Woman Groans ] She had a gun, man! Why has she-- Why has she got a gun, huh? Just the heavy metal, Allan. Right. [ Groaning ] - Let's go! - [ Groaning ] "...says Captain Cor Van Deventer. He took an arsenal-- enough to blast a hole through the middle of this country." Can't believe the first time I shoot somebody, I shoot a woman. "Fear the Stander Gang." Gang? That's crass. "...are planning a new series of robberies, this time with deadly force." What other kind is there? "Victim identified the shooter as escaped convict Lee McCall." - Oh, fuck! - She's well enough to I.D. you. - I wish I'd killed the bitch. - "Police have set up a special task force." Gentlemen, we have graduated to task force. "A nerve center in Yoeville--" [ Stander ] I know this building. And you know what's right next door? That's completely outrageous. [ Chuckling ] What's so fucking funny? - They think scared, so they think we'll lie low. - [ Allan Laughing ] Fuck predictable. Let's do it. * Bo bo bo bo bo bo I feel free * * Bo bo bo bo bo bo I feel free * * Hmm mmm mmm mmm * Bo bo bo bo bo bo I feel free * * Bo bo bo bo bo bo I feel free * * Bo bo bo bo bo bo I feel free * * Bo bo bo bo bo bo I feel free * ** [ Man Vocalizing ] ** [ Vocalizing Continues ] ** [ Ends ] [ Tires Squealing ] [ Muttering ] Shit! Leave it, Lee. Isn't that the-the-- the bank robbers? Hey! What are you doing! Lee! Get out of the car now! Lee! Lee! Lee! He's cool. He's cool. [ Speaking Foreign Language ] [ Man Chuckling ] This is crazy. This is fuckin' crazy. I mean, what the fuck are we doing, huh? I mean, we're riskin' our necks when they know we are coming, and you're giving the fuckin' money away. - I mean, what's the point, eh? What's the fuckin' point-- - Shut up. [ Allan ] Take it easy, relax. It's cool. Take your time. Smile. Don't turn around. Don't look at your coworkers. Very good. Just keep filling the bag. [ Screaming ] Lee. [ Sirens Blaring ] What the fuck, Lee? We said no fucking shooting, eh? We said no shooting! - Fuck! - Just drive! - [ Allan ] Shit for brains! - [ Gunshots ] Gun! What the fuck? He's out of his mind. I can't do it. I'm not going to make it. Relax. Fuck him. They're so busy investigating the last three, they're stretched thin. Fuck you. Fuck you! I don't need to set a bank robbing record. [ Allan ] Leave him in the van next time. Fuck him. Lee. Don't need him. Lee. This is supposed to be fun, huh? [ Chattering ] You know it's not often that houses like this come on the market. He can't be serious. [ Woman On TV ] In our top story, police have deployed extra officers... at bank branches in the wake of five bank robberies, all last Friday, attributed to the Stander Gang. Here's what you had to say. [ Man ] You know, uh, he's just doing what a lot of people wish they could do. He's got nerve. I'll give him that. How about some personal credit here? -They even repeat the same bank. -We'll announce ourselves as the Heyl Gang next time. That would be very nice, Andre. And they have courage. And I think he's really inventive. You're obviously not the only ones who enjoy seeing the tables turn, eh? [ Woman On TV ] The Premier of the Soviet Union has died. Right, Allan. That's why we're bigger news than the head the head of fucking Russia. [ Gasps ] Jesus! You scared the shit out of me. Sorry about that. I had to make sure we were alone. [ Stander ] It's different now. I'm different. So I've read. Always different, never the same. What's changed, Andre? Money. Money solves a lot of problems, Bekkie. Got plenty of that. We can go anywhere. Anywhere in the world. Anywhere but here, right? What about my life? What about my freedom? Freedom? There's no freedom here. There's two choices-- either become them... or you live at odds with everything around you. I don't want that for you. We'll start over. America. New I.D. Your dreams can come true. I'll make them happen. Well, that's very glamorous, Andre. But unlike you, I look terrible in a black wig and glasses. I'm quite fine, thank you very much, in my quiet little life. I want to take you with me. I promised, remember? Don't start. You're everything to me. All I've ever wanted. I had everything I wanted. Everything. Bekk. The things they say about me-- I'm not stupid, Andre. There's not a thinking man among us... that doesn't want to blow this place to smithereens from time to time. But we don't. We find other ways. I won't make it without you. I need to be left alone. Oh, Jesus! You love me. We would be together. I know how this will end. Lauderdale, the beach. Remember? You come with me. I'm tired, Andre. Some things are done that can't be undone. I hate you. Are you coming to work today, Lee? Huh? I said, "Are you coming to work today?" - Morning all. - How is it? - Morning. - Would you like some eggs? Ja. Ja. It's been a long time since I've had a home-cooked meal. I'm glad you like it. [ Stander ] You wouldn't have any dust over there, would you, Shar? - Andre. - Lee. I know Shar's not your kind of woman, but she's the kind I dreamed of, right. Dream come true. I'm happy for you. You have plans? We should all have plans. In fact, I'm thinking of making a change myself. With my lady. Maybe the States. Lauderdale. Try something different. That's great, man. What about you, Allan? Me? Uh-- I'd like to go to Greece. Well, we got plenty of money. I mean, enough to last for a while. Get all the airline schedules. We'll plan it. [ Stander ] Between 3:00 and 5:00 on Sunday, two S.A.A. 747s, B.A., K.L.M., Air France, Lufthansa-- all coming in. They're already in. We want to go out. El Al to Tel Aviv 32 minutes later. You'll be on it. A Hasidic Rabbi on the way to a Talmud seminar with his niece. Or a wrestling coach on his way to a match in Melbourne. Shar, make us some tea, will ya? Okay. Enough to live good for a while. Why not forever? Rip off the fucking airport. Aw, fuckin' hell. You sly-- I might have known. We've written a pretty good story so far. [ McCall ] Are you joking? Why not a perfect ending? Jesus fuckin' Christ. Stander's last stand, eh? I think it's fucking great. That's fuckin' great, yeah. Pounds, marks, dollars. You can go anywhere in the world. - Anywhere in the world. - Right. Yeah. Okay. Right. ** [ Vocalizing: "The Blue Danube" ] Vienna, my boy. [ Woman On P.A., Indistinct ] [ Water Splashing ] [ McCall ] Spilled my champagne, huh? To you and to me. And to your lovely little breasts. Let's swim. Come on. [ Shar ] Swim? [ McCall ] Swim. Swim. You're warm. Look at you go, and your pineapple chunks. Trying to drown me, huh? [ Shar Giggles ] Right. Give me my champagne. And don't drown me. [ Chattering ] [ Shar Laughs ] [ Chattering Continues ] ** [ Man Singing In Foreign Language ] [ Chattering ] [ Yelling In Zulu ] [ Zulu Continues ] What do you want? A few years ago-- [ Speaking Zulu ] His name-- Mnguni. Robert. I'm looking for his family. Themba Mnguni. Themba Mnguni? Themba! [ Man ] Yeah. [ Speaking Zulu ] [ People Murmuring ] Fuck him and fuck you too! I was fuckin' ready, huh! And he fuckin' blows it! We were outta here! - You didn't want to do it anyway. - Fuck! [ Groans ] [ Murmuring ] [ Murmuring Continues ] [ TV: Female Reporter ] On the crime front, a report just in... advised that police have thwarted an alleged Stander Gang plan... to commit a robbery at the international airport. Police under the command of Cor Van Deventer-- [ Heyl ] Amazing. They would have had us. Even when he's wrong, he's right. Stander himself was spotted outside the airport terminal. [ Knocking ] [ TV: Off ] Give me that gun. Oh, fuck! Oh, my God! - Face it. You were wrong! - He'll try it again. I know him. That bastard is still running you. He's running the goddamn force! He has made us look impotent in our own country. What does this tell our enemies within? We want him stopped, Captain. Shot if necessary. Shot on sight. I understand. [ Line Ringing ] [ Bekkie ] Hello? [ Water Sloshing ] I'm sorry. I've let you all down. You'll have to go without me. Never give up, do you? Eh? I'll come soon. I'm not going. You'll find a way. You always do. I think I have the way. [ Man ] She's a 55-foot steel ketch. Perkins diesels. Solar panel. Long range fuel tank. She's got a range, under power, of about a thousand nautical miles. All the best equipment. [ Chuckles ] I used to have a water bed, but the rolling got a bit much. I could recommend a good chef. - Cheers. - Cheers. She's valued at £148,000. Who was the Lily Rose? A wife. Considered bad luck to change the name of a boat... even when you change your woman. She'll go with the boat, all right. But that's her negotiation. Now then, what did you have in mind? [ Laughs ] No waiting for the check to clear then, is there? Right! Fucking genius, eh! The high seas! [ Strains ] Madam, you better come with me. [ Deventer ] Hold out on me... and I swear I will charge you as a member of the Stander Gang. I can make your life hell. He knew the money was bent. Everyone's dishonest. Just a matter of degree. He would have taken less. Why hit the man when he's down? It would bring us bad karma in our new life. Had enough of that in my old one. Know what got me started on all of this? Are you saying it wasn't greed, Allan? It was a girl. A black girl. She wasn't mine, but... I loved her. I really loved her. I was a student at teacher-training college. I was full of politics, full of hope. She was pregnant, not by me. I shouldn't have been with her. But the fucking cops-- They came into where we were. They saw us together. They beat us. They beat the baby out of her. So I robbed a store to get her money to go to England. And it was easy. Too easy. Taking down those banks, fucking with those bastards. Thanks. The girl on the boat-- you think he was serious about her? Lee's got Shar. You've got yours. She is coming, isn't she? She's always with me. Always will be. One place I fucked up, my bro. Hey, give it another go. You've got a way now. It's different. - [ Chattering ] - [ Man ] Thank you. Move along. [ Man ] Thank you. Come on. Shar? Shar? [ Man Over Megaphone ] This is the South African police force! You are surrounded! Put your hands in the air, and stay where you are! Don't make any sudden move! Stay calm. Stay calm. Move along. You cannot escape. You are surrounded! Go on. Go on. Thank you. Keep moving. [ Man Yells, Indistinct ] [ Explosion ] [ Onlookers Screaming, Shouting ] All right. Okay. [ Explosion ] [ Man Yelling, Indistinct ] Come out with your hands in the air! You are surrounded. There is no chance to escape! [ Man ] Went out okay. Like Butch Cassidy. Like Bonnie and Clyde. Doesn't matter much. Out is out. [ Man ] Move along! Get all these cars out. Move along! Move along! What do we do now? Head back to the boat? They've got the mansion. Then they get the phone record. They'll make us in Cape Town. Hit it, Allan. [ Woman Over Radio ] All vehicles in the Johannesburg area, be on the lookout for a yellow 1983 Porsche Targa. License number-- [ Siren Wailing ] Shit. You think they'll catch us? - Speed of light, Andre. - Try the speed of darkness. [ Gunshots ] Are you out of your fuckin'-- Your car. Good. Hell, take mine. [ Yelling in Zulu ] Better stop the car now. Fucking bastards. All those guns to take out Lee. It was me who did this to him. I should've left him in jail. Ah, fuck that. You gave him the best time of his life. The last six months, he was somebody. Eh? The wrong ones do keep dying. I, uh-- I had a brother. But, uh, you two-- probably as close as anyone to knowing me. You won't make it with me. We've got this far, all right? We'll get another boat. Can't fool me, Allan. Can't fool yourself. Hey. I'll see you in hell, bro. Go. - [ Phone Ringing ] - [ Woman Over Phone ] Hello? [ Stander Over Phone ] Is this Mrs. Mark Jennings? Yes. Can I help you? [ Stander ] I'm from the office of the high court. We've managed to accelerate the review of your husband's case. So we'll be sending an officer this very afternoon to collect his documents... for the preparation of the trial. Okay. [ Stander ] In the case of false arrest or mistaken identity, - the court requires passport, - Passport. - book of life, - Yes. birth certificate and a fourth photo I.D. - All right. - All of which will be returned following the trial. These are mine. This is yours. Thank you. And that's everything in there. If you need an envelope-- Keep that someplace safe. Thanks very much. My pleasure. Bye-bye. [ Woman On P.A. Speaking Foreign Language ] Please proceed to Gate 3. Good afternoon, sir. I was hoping for-- Andre Stander! [ Sighs ] Not again. I am reaching for my wallet! I am already suing the Johannesburg police... and several of their officers personally for false arrest. And if you don't remove that weapon from my face, sir, I'll bring a charge of assault against you as well. It's a sad state of affairs when a man has to carry a library to keep from being arrested. Sir. He's been sighted. Where? At the airport. Come on. Let's go! Look, either use force to arrest me... or let me get on with my life. Sorry, sir. Sir, false alarm. Wrong man. No worries. I'll catch you later, huh? Thank you. Sorry, sir. Police! Keep it clear! No, no, no! Wait! Wait! Wait! Police! It's gone! Hold on! Hold on!

Hutch. With Starsky. Hmm. And if he commits them? Well, what kind of a TV show would that make? You're cute when you laugh. [ Man ] Hey, Cheryl! Sigma Phi's having a blowout at the motel! Free beer! Oh, my God! I am so there! A call for you, boss. Who is it? Ja? Jawel. Hello. This is Skolly. Remember me? I used to work for you, General Stander, sir. Ja, Skolly. How are you? It-It's good to hear from you. Oh, I'm fine, General, sir. I just called to say... you must not worry about Master Andre. You know he always tried to do his best. And I know he always loved you, sir, and respected you. And I know he always will. And he will-- he will always be my dear son. [ Stander ] I'm quite sure he'll do the right thing. Just lost his way somewhere. Yes, I'm quite sure he'll do the right thing now. And I know, General, sir, you always did your best for him. God be with you... Skolly. God be with you too, Dad. ** [ Disco ] [ Man ] Get out of the road, mister! [ Laughs ] Move it! [ Engine Starts ] [ Police Radio Chatter ] Hey! Hey!
