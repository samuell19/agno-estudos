What are you joking about? Wow, this is terrible! Wow, it's so dangerous, someone might die! So, let's take action. Hey, are you crazy? Hey, you brat! This is terrible! God seeks in return. It's so scary. Rise to action. Are you okay? ah, yes. I'm fine. Do you want to go outside for some air? Sure. Don't take pictures! Pork liver is a hidden menu item. They're enforcing strict rules now. Then I'll edit and post it on Instagram. That would defeat the purpose of posting, right? You're not smart. You're the dumb one. That's too much. Exactly! Hey, what's wrong with you guys? Oh, I'm taking her outside for some fresh air. Sorry is she okay? Doesn't look like it. What's the girl's name again? Listen, what's her name? Yuri-Chan. Call her Yuri-chan. (Little Yuri). Yuri-chan. She's a YouTuber right? Proof. Remember other people's names properly. Hey, you're not the one to say that. I just met her too. How would I know? I'm sorry. I have such a poor tolerance for alcohol and I drank so much. It's okay. I'm really sorry. I'm not used to these kinds of gatherings. Me neither. I was only called here for the sake of the business deal. Here, drink some water. What is this? It's too cold. What the heck? Although it's a serious turn. That girl is too aggressive. This one is also too cold. Is the host always like this? Proof. Then I can become one too. Successfully used one by one. Rock-paper-scissors to guess the source. Wait, wait, what about Senpai? Is it okay if he's not here? It's fine. Even without Senpai, he can't do anything to us with Tian's help. No, if Senpai isn't here, he'll be upset when we finish selecting. It's okay. Tamagomi-san is a god. He's very kind. It's okay. Is it really okay? It's okay, it's okay. I want Mizuki. I want a busty girl. So Mizuki-chan is that? That's why I said let's play rock-paper-scissors. Alright, let's go. Bring the girl home and play rock-paper-scissors. Rock-paper-scissors, to decide. ah! I want Satsuki. You're such a person. It's a misunderstanding. I was just joking earlier. let's go to karaoke. I'm going back. so dirty! Yuri-Chan! What are you doing? Yuri, let's go back. Bring this with us too. Let's go next time. Why wait for next time? Let's go now. why are you so angry? Stop talking. Are you okay? Can you please leave? Let's meet again next time. goodbye. Be careful for real. Successfully used one. I am Yuri-chan! Today, I want to completely recreate the final scene of the last episode of "Little Voice" that was aired last week. That's everyone's beloved Tsukishima Maiko. i want to be by your side, even if it's just for a short while. Hey Hey hey. What? This is company property. Did you get permission? No, I'm sorry. Your actions will cause trouble for us. I'll tidy up right away. Okay. What are you filming? Ah, um... Don't upload it online. Okay. It's completely under control. Apologies for not delivering on time. The shipping point will arrange the delivery in order. Yes, the fastest can be shipped the same day I'm so sorry that the item you purchased is... It's fine. Hello, I'm Tamogami. Thank you for your help the other day. I should be the one thanking you. I caused you a lot of trouble. No worries. Um, I just read the email. You said you have something to discuss with me? Well, Tamogami-san, your job is to handle various activities. But if I'm bothering you, it's okay to refuse... Ah, no, it's fine. What's up? I would like to borrow a costume for a video shoot. I don't know where to inquire. Ah, a costume? Yes, but I don't have much money. Ah, I see. Ah, if it's not possible, then forget it. Ah, it's okay. Let me ask around for you. The dance video for that song is really popular. So I want to try filming a video too. No one has ever recreated the PV of that song in a video. Really? If you film it, everyone will be surprised. But it has to go smoothly. Oh, by the way. Are there any cafes that sell large fruit parfait or something like that? Ah, a cafe? Oh, I know an ice cream shop, but it feels a bit different. Well... let's film here and see. Yes. It's completely different from this place. Where is this? Yes. Oh, I know an ice cream shop, but it feels a bit different. Let's take a picture here Really? Is it okay? No problem. Ah, this is what I want to recreate. It's completely different from this place. Where is this? Maybe it's in Hawaii. Hawaii? It's completely different from here. Is it okay? Well, let's try our best within our means. Ah, it's really suitable for filming videos. The weather is so nice today. This weather... Hahaha Alright, we're ready. Good. Let's start filming. Wait a moment. Okay, ready. Three, two, one, recording. Wait, sorry. Huh? What does this gesture mean? Ah, sorry. It's just my habit. Don't make me laugh. Ah, sorry. Then let's start. Get ready. Start. Sorry, this place doesn't feel like Hawaii at all. The rest are places like fishing ports. It's fine. This place will do. Really? Yes. And does it matter if we use this? It's dirty. It got dirty during the previous event. The company bought it. Ah, it's really cute. It has a bit of a Jacob feel. JACOB? I can't explain it well either. Anyway, it has a Jacob vibe. Is that so? Then I'll put on this Jacob mask. Oh, it's totally Jacob. One person. Hahaha, Little Jacob. Then please recreate the dance of this squirrel here. Huh? Do I have to dance too? Just do your best. How should I dance to this? Like this? Hahaha, yes. Like this? You're really kind. Yes. Ah, this is the last part. I'm going to release it. Three, two, one. Let's start. It's over. Did the dance look okay? Make the movements bigger, like this. Ah, thank you. Thank you for your help. Ah, what should we do with this? I don't need it anymore. Do you want to take it? Can I? Sure, but are you sure it's okay? It's fine, it's fine. Tamogami-san is really amazing. Ah, that's good then. Now I don't know how to edit and add subtitles. Make it look like a PV. Ah, I often do this kind of work. I can help. Really? Yes, let me assist you. I often make PVs for companies. Okay, can you do it? No problem. Hahaha, like a god! No, not at all. Because usually no one accompanies me during filming. But you even helped with the editing. You're truly like a god. Sorry. Thank you. You finished using the internet? Did you go to meet Saki earlier? Ah, well... Did you borrow money from him again? That's not good. Seems like he's not having an easy time either. He said it's the last time. He will definitely ask you for more money. He's a master of lies. He borrowed money before, claiming he was sick, but he actually went gambling. He's a worthless bum. That's right. He definitely won't pay you back. Well, there's nothing we can do about it. You're too kind-hearted. Oh, I just helped her with the final editing. ah i was just helping her with the final editing. Are you saying you two did something? How is that possible? Really? Oh, I did it with Mizuki the day before yesterday. Oh no. I said you could sit anywhere. Oh, well. There's still leftover stewed beef. Do you want some? Oh, I'm already full. It's fine. Thank you. It's really delicious. I'm sorry, this is all I can do to repay you. It's alright, no problem. I'll pour some barley tea for you. Thank you. It's rare to have you help me this time. But the reviews aren't very good. It's okay, it's okay. No matter what I do, I can't do it well. My mind isn't sharp, and I'm clumsy in everything I do. And on top of that, I have a face that's physically unappealing. Well, you don't have to pay attention to those weird comments. Besides, there are also good comments among them. The only good comment is "JACOB is ugly and shady," right? So next time, come back and shoot something with Jacob. Can you still help me? Well, I can do it when I'm free. Well, let's do something challenging together with Jacob next time. If we fail, it will still be interesting. Oh, that sounds fun. Will our fans increase? Definitely. No, for the sake of gaining more fans, I have to work hard too. Today we have to stay together until the end. Hey, Yuri-chan. Ah, Jacob, Jacob. We're almost there, just about a kilometer away. You're lying. I'm serious. You're lying. It's true, I swear. Liar. I'm going to set it free! The word "God" here just now That "ç¥ž" character earlier, can it be changed to yellow color with a glowing effect? Ah, yes, it can be done. Can I trouble you with that? Because Tamagami-san is helping with post-production, I have more time to conceive plans. And when I used to receive comments alone, I would easily feel discouraged. But now, with Tamogami-san by my side, laughing and not caring as much. Is that so? Ah, it's done. Ah, it's really great. Can we use it like this? Ah, it's really great. Can we use it like this? This is your channel, no need for my permission. this is your channel don't need my permission call No, it's thanks to Tamogami-san that we have achieved this success. I truly respect you. I'm not that amazing... we have advertising revenue now! Amazing! But it's only 1,500 yen. How should we split it with Tamagami-san? We've used the room. I hope there will be more in the future. Thanks. But what if we earn more in the future? Yuri-Chan, you decide. Alright, even though we haven't seen the shadow of the money yet, after persevering for over a year, we finally received 1,500 yen... Although we knew it would be like this early on, reality is truly cruel. This is really terrible. And without an on-site director, it's really difficult to handle. Ah, right. It's difficult for me to take charge of this. It seems that it will take a while before God appears. What did you say? I saw that girl's video. Yes. You don't show your face? Doesn't she want you to show your face? I don't have to work behind the scenes. Oh, I see. You're busy too. Ah, it's nothing. I'll handle it myself. I'm sorry for constantly troubling you. Alright, let's leave it at that. Don't... Necessary to determine 7 9? Hmm, you calm down first. I'm sorry. I should have listened to your plan beforehand. Well, I'm sorry. Tamagami-san is not at fault. It's just that I acted without permission No, because we were originally working together, right? But You don't have to take all the blame yourself, it's okay. I feel like I'm going bankrupt because of this. I'm really sorry. I'm really impressed. I only agreed because you said she was your acquaintance Regarding the website, there are four issues related to the sixteen ping pong... I'll take responsibility for the training. I will continue to work hard from now on. I'm really sorry. Alright, okay. Then it's time to edit and add subtitles. I'll hurry and upload it soon. Okay. I'm sorry, thank you so much. I already said it's fine. There are positive comments too, so it shouldn't be a big problem. It's okay on the store's end as well. Once things settle down there, let's apologize together. I'm sorry, I guess I can't do anything alone. That's not true. Hey, what's wrong with you? This is the only way I can repay you... Ah, well... Is this causing you a lot of trouble? Ah, not really, but... It really doesn't matter. I didn't help you because I expected anything in return. I really don't think I'm suitable for this. That's not true. No matter how hard I try, my fan base never grows. I just keep causing trouble for others. I'm really tired. Thinking of plans, shooting videos, it's all in vain. What was considered futile until the time of success When you succeed, things that you previously thought were in vain suddenly become important. Is that what Huang said? Did he say it on Kirby's channel? No, when I attended his lecture before, he said it. Is there really such a thing? Because I wanted to ask him if he had any secrets to gaining fans. I'm sorry for asking for so much help. Did you get any secrets then? Um, what he said was too difficult to understand. Next time, invite me to go with you, okay? yes. I'm really sorry, I haven't dabbled in this area either. Ah, let me confirm your request again. I'll reply to your call later. Okay. Because I think it lacks taste. The subtitles also look outdated. The BGM is too sudden. Beep beep beep. Can this really become popular? Ah Yuri. We're going to have lunch, are you coming? Yes. Let's go. Doodle-doodle-doo Ah, I'm sorry. I was still thinking about calling you back. Hello? I've been busy lately, running around everywhere this week. I think it's fine to keep it the same as before. Oh, really? I don't think we need to increase the frequency of uploading videos. Yes. But I feel like the views are lower than before. Is that so? Indeed, it's lower than before. Um, yeah, it's a bit... But Marlin, your experiments have always been a bit extreme... It looks painful! No, it's just normal. Then, Miles, who usually comes up with the plans? oh. Both sides do, right? That's right. We often change the planned videos as well. But recently, it's been mostly him suggesting the plans. So this arrangement was unintentional? Of course, it was unintentional. How can we make It less deliberate and spontaneous? Well, it's good to have some spontaneity. That's Yuri Yuri I'm Yuri I remember you. I watched your video. huh? thanks. Mr. Murakami? I am in charge of his activities. Didn't I return the ticket to you at the previous party? Ah that's great! Shall I introduce them to you? Abandon? Kirby and choryo? Yes. Right. just introduce water but... It's okay, let me introduce you Ah, I feel like today's age group is so tall ah yes? yes oh this is it Yuri-chan Channel Spin? The content is really boring! It's okay, just watch it once. It's terrible to cover. Very low playback volume! Ha ha Delicate cake stove haha japonica cake bad So I'm a little transparent The one in the doll costume is Tamogami-san, right? Yeah. Ah, I feel like dancing is too amateurish. Inside people are too stiff. How about a more fashionable and cute packaging? You are so cute. No no. But Mr Tamogami's taste is a bit old. Because Tamogami-san's work is also responsible for the activities of middle-aged and elderly people. Like this? No wonder it smells like an uncle. It would be nice to have someone with good taste to help. Ah, how about Mr. Murakami, the design sickness? Ah, Murakami can do it Then I will introduce him to you next time. It can definitely make you cute. ah do you need it. Being able to participate in this party is really like a dream for me. Are you free next week should be? I'm Kabigon. I'm Chorei. The best game. didn't we have been severely punished by Kimney before? Didn't we have been severely punished by Kemei before? wow that's terrible For details, please watch the previous Kimney video. Yeah so this time we want to give him a break! So this time we are for Brother Kimney So, we're here to introduce a guest who will be participating in this retaliation plan. And she is the blogger, Yuri-chan! With great anticipation, let's welcome Yuri-chan! Make your entrance!" Yuri-Chan. Toe-to-toe plan for the Golden Tour team! Hello, everyone. I'm Yuri-chan!" We're going to make paint Yuri-chan , are you not afraid? I'm Yuri-chan, and I won't make any mistakes! the plan to cover him in body paint! We'll have Yuri-chan do it first! It's about applying paint on the body to create clothing-like patterns. we've already made plans to meet Kimney tonight. We'll have Yuri-chan sit together with him. It's settled. It's really strong. I have a feeling that Kimney will have quite an interesting reaction. It should be quite exciting and intense. If his loyal companion, were to witness it... He will definitely be infuriated to the point of exploding. Wow, I'm really looking forward to it too! Let's start preparing right away! Great! I'll give it my best and make sure not to catch a cold! are you cheering for this! Isn't this a bit explicit? Ah, sorry about that. It's alright. I'll get you some clothes to wear right away. No, I mean "paint clothes" on you. Ah, right. Please wait a moment. Okay, let's start with the back first. Okay, we're done with the back. Now let's move on to the front. Let's begin! Aren't you the NG-free Yuri-chan? Ah, right... It's fine... Please don't stare too much... It's fine! It's art, after all. Yeah. Let's start! Now let's paint the front. We're done with that, right? Now let's paint the front. Start! We're done with that, right? finished! Body painting completed! finished! It's like wearing clothes, right? No, it's like being completely naked! Stand still, it's a little smudged there. CD JS in the middle of work. Tomoyuki. Please wait a moment. This person is today's client, Mr. Shimizu. Nice to meet you. Mr Tamogami. Nice to meet you. I'm really lucky this time. That video became the most-watched video on Miles overnight. I didn't expect to gain so many fans in just one night. Yes. There are many comments asking me to do body painting on Yuri-chan Channel. Did you see them? Yes. Should we try filming it then? I don't think it's a good idea. Is that so? But the popularity is high right now. I think doing that kind of content... Would be vulgar... Ah, but it's still quite interesting. But I'm worried that you, Yuri-chan, might be looked down upon... Ah, I'm sorry. I thought if the fans increased, you, Mr. Tamamori, would also be happy... - Well, that's good, but... - I was thinking that if the fans increased, you, Mr. Tamomori, would also be happy... Well, that's good, but... Then the next project will be done after Tamomori-San agrees with me. I've thought a lot about it this time... I'm sorry I'm going back to work. I've been thinking a lot this time... I'm sorry, but I have to go back to work. I won't be able to participate next time, but I can help you with video editing. Please send me the video then. Ah, why are you here? I just wanted to visit. Oh, really? Sorry for the late editing and the rough work... Tamogami-san. Mr. Shishita is calling you. Ah, okay, I have to go now. What? I'm sorry for taking up so much of your time all along. Next time, I want to collaborate with other people to make videos... Oh, really? Yes. This is Yuri-chan's channel. Just do whatever you like. Mr. Shishita is waiting, Just watch whatever you like. Mr. Shishita is waiting. Alright, I'll take my leave then. Yuri. It's... too long. Have you always wanted to try this? I've always wanted to... I've always wanted to try it! I've always wanted to try it! Always! Yeah, I'm a little surprised too. Yes, but it's also a bit of a surprise Very concerned Very concerned It's been a long time since monosilicosis, but I still feel a throbbing in my heart It's been a long time since monosilicosis, but I still feel a throbbing in my heart Change? Thatâ€™s the one, what the hell is that? What the hell is that? Is your uniform a bit tight? Mixed-- Is it very tight? When I put it on, I felt like, "Ah, it's okay." Ah, it's okay. Not really. Ah, it's okay. Not really. Ah, I was really surprised. It feels good, but I can't quite explain it. Oh, really? Thank you. But the promotional project that Yuri gave me before. When I saw it, I thought it would suit you very well. It's amazing. I think it's amazing. Oh, really? Yes. Yes. But I feel like the transitions in the visuals are a bit too fast, I can't keep up... Sorry, I'm currently with someone. But I feel like the transitions in the visuals are a bit too fast, I can't keep up... Sorry, I'm currently with someone. Ah, really? Sorry for bothering you while you're busy. Then next time... Oh, really? That's great. Um, when I was in New York, I specialized in handling information graphics Yes. And I also did some geometric design. I wanted to start with those aspects. Yes. Mr. Murakami, be careful of the mud. Thank you. Ah, I should also make a cup for Mr. Tamogami. Ah, it's not necessary. What's this? ah this is... The work uniform I use at my job. I made an extra one. ah Oh, I see. It's a bit embarrassing for a designer to see it like this. I'm sorry. It looks a bit outdated, haha. I appreciate your thoughtfulness. But if you have such an idea, I hope you can let me know in advance. Ah, yes, I'm sorry. I originally wanted to surprise you. It seems like it failed, huh? And regarding future work... Adding subtitles and special effects to the videos. I want to edit according to the plan Mr. Murakami prepared. Ah, really? The previous work was really good indeed. I'm sorry. No problem. Hahaha, I'm really looking forward to it. It's Ahai, right? Hai, yeah! I'm really looking forward to it. There's only one hole here. Is it that powerful? It's so noisy. It's really noisy. There's only one hole here. Is it that powerful? this is the foot. foot. this is the head. Ah, Mr. Tamogami. Can we let Chika-chan take the lead this time? Ah, really? I understand. That thing is placed here. This one, right? Hasn't it been washed? Yes. It smells so bad, hey. Will it be okay to wear this? Why not? But it really stinks. But it really stinks Who wore this? When was it last washed? Never washed. Come and smell it. Come and smell it. No, I won't smell it. Come and smell it. Come and smell it. No, I won't smell it. Put this on and smell it. No, I won't smell it. I think I can smell it a little. That's why I said it stinks. So I said it stinks Is it better to jump harder? And is it better to be more natural? The lovely feeling of Chika-chan has improved. OK. This one is also very cute. And then connect them like this. We're about to start shooting. Don't leave things there. And then connect them like this. We're about to start shooting. Don't leave things there. Okay, understood. Please put the items a little further away; they might be captured here too. Ah, sorry. Wait a moment. That person will also affect the shooting. Can you ask him to move farther away? Okay. Hurry up! The sun is about to set! Sorry, please wait a little longer. Um, sorry. We need to shoot the video here. Could you please...? In Section E, there's JJN. Could you please go over there? Sorry. Hurry up! Okay, hold the snow. Um, sorry. We'll finish shooting soon. Can you please move aside for a moment? Sorry, we'll really finish soon. Can you please go over there first? I'm really sorry. CD JS on the work in progress. Sorry, I can't borrow any money. Please, can you help me out? Sorry. Please, can you help me out? Sorry. Please find a way to help once more. Sorry, I really can't. Please find a way to help once more. Sorry, I really can't. Just a little bit, please. I beg you. - No, sorry, - just a little bit, please. Just a little bit, please. I beg you. - I'm sorry - just a little bit, please. Excuse me. I did not mean anything else. Mr. Tamogami, you may not like this approach. But Mr. Murakami said the popularity is still there, so we should continue. I understand that it's popular, but... Repeatedly appearing nude like this... Are you looking at this with biased eyes? Body painting is art, you know. Ah, yes, indeed. Renting this place also requires money. It's difficult for me if you say it like this now. Saying these things before the shooting also affects my mood... Ah, yeah, sorry. What about this? It's for painting on the back. oh! Ah, this one is good. Okay, great. No one has ever filmed a body painting video of themselves before. This is definitely going to be a hit. But can I paint well...? Ah, can you please move aside for a moment? ah? Ah, Yuki is about to undress. So, it would be better to have fewer people here. So, can those who are not involved in the work please go outside? Okay. Do I need a board to paint on? Then I'll try using a board too. Was this also prepared for this time? Ah, I feel a bit embarrassed now. Why aren't you wearing underwear? Ah, do I not need to be completely naked? No, just take off the top. Ah, wait, wait a minute. Where is my underwear? I can't find them. How did they disappear? How come they are gone? Sato. What's wrong? Did you see my panties? No. Don't you know? Look, is that person going to jump off the building? I hope not. Look, He's about to jump. They're definitely going to jump. Is it true? Wow, wait, He's about to jump! Wow, is it really happening? Don't jump! It's going to be a disaster. Is it really happening? This is terrible, he really jumped. Have you heard? He committed suicide by jumping off the building. Yes. Jumping off a building is really frightening. I regret it so much. If I had just talked to him as a peer, things might have been different. To be honest, I had some money prepared to lend him. Really? How much did you lend him in total? Forget it, it's private. Tell me, otherwise it will bother me. about 1 million. ah? I was the guarantor for his loan. And we still need to add that small amount? How much is it? Around 4 million. Really? If you act as the guarantor, would you still have to repay the debt if the person commits suicide? Yes. Are you okay? I do not know. It must be stressful. Yeah, I should talk to her about it. Oh, Yuri, she must have made a fortune. Really? Yes, she even appeared on TV before. Honestly, her success is mostly thanks to you, right? I never told you, but she used to say your taste was outdated. Your work is all aimed at middle-aged and elderly people, and you have an old-fashioned style. I felt really angry when I heard that. I really like working here. want to continue working here. But, sorry, the channel's popularity is too high now. It would be too much to handle two jobs at the same time. But you're really amazing, keep it up! Thank you, you also have to work hard. Goodbye! But didn't you say before that you would handle the income distribution? Ah, yes. So, it's not possible? That's right. Because it wouldn't be good to keep revising the agreed-upon terms, right? In terms of work, we should avoid such things, right? Well, can you lend me some money temporarily...? How much? I'm in urgent need. 5000,000 Sorry, I can't. I have already arranged my finances. Is that so? You must be busy with work too, right? So, I'll rely on my own people from now on. It's no use for me to come and help? I'm a bit busy right now, but next month... No, we have enough staff now. And we already have a perfect team led by Mr. Murakami. Will it be difficult for you if I join? Well, it would be a bit... It's because of your taste... Like dance moves, it's different from your taste, right. Yeah, that's true. I've always been thankful to you. This is Yuri-chan's new home. The moving company staff is working hard to create Yuri-chan's new home. That's impressive. Ah, sorry. Can you please move this sofa over there? Please put that sofa over there. Sure. I bought two large sofas. No one has sat on them yet. I'm planning to invite friends and have a big party. Hello everyone, I am Yuri-chan. This time, I invited someone I've always admired, the god of design. Hey, god! Hello, everyone. I'm designer Murakami Aaron. Mr. Murakami is truly a god. Actually, Mr. Murakami designed a special T-shirt exclusively for this channel. No time to waste. I'm going to change now. Ah, there's no way I'll change here. Sakurai, how does it look? Isn't it cute? Mr. Murakami really has great taste. Thank you for the award. He's truly a god. Sometimes we see very artistic designs, right? I have no design knowledge at all. I design based solely on my feelings. Ah, that's true... I really wonder how those designs are conceived. Don't they harm anyone's eyes? Lately, there have been people like that around, right? yes. Yes. yes Ha ha. How do they even come up with those things? How did you come up with it? I really want to know. I really want to know. I know you're busy too but can you please make time for it? This time, physically speaking, it's really impossible to make it on time. The budget and manpower can't be increased, right? At this time... that's it I'll think again if there's any other way. Ah, Mr. Tamomori. Why didn't you come yesterday? It was Yuri's birthday party. It's okay. Sorry about that. Pick it up quickly! Wasn't it you who dropped it? Pick it up, hurry! Hey, pick it up! I told you not to call me. Let's meet in person. That's why! It can't be explained without meeting in person! I really don't have much time. This is really abnormal, isn't it? ah? I've helped you a lot, haven't I? I know. I am very grateful to you. do you really know? I stayed up all night helping you with the videos! I know. I even borrowed a car for you and prepared the necessary props at my own expense. By rights... Sorry to bother you. What would you like to order? Add an unlimited drink. Okay. Don't you at least think about giving me some kind of reward? I couldn't even say it before. When the chicken shop closed down, I even paid for the settlement fee. ah? I don't want to make you sad. I've been supporting you behind the scenes to prevent you from being sad and worried. You definitely don't understand all of this, do you? But afterwards, I've thought about it carefully. Isn't it the shop's own problem? Providing illegal food. Huh? Because the shop itself provided illegal food to regular customers. I ate it without knowing. I should be the victim, right? You can, right? Huh? I know you are selfish! But you've gone too far in trampling on someone else's goodwill! Haven't I always been grateful to you? But instead, you're just seeking to repay the favor, right? Didn't you pretend before that you weren't seeking anything in return when helping someone like me? But this shouldn't be a case of repaying kindness with hostility, right? What I mean is, at least show some sincerity towards others' kindness! Is your idea of sincerity just money? Isn't that a form of compensation? Well, yeah. What I meant was, in difficult times, both parties should help each other. Okay, let's drop it. Ah, what should we do now? I've been stuck in my thinking for a while. How about trying cosplay? Sure, let's give it a try. We'll definitely earn from it. Definitely earn. What do you think? I think it's a good idea. But I don't know what you've been talking about this whole time... What do you mean you don't know? And also... look at this I forgot to mention. I paid for the accommodation during the hot spring shoot. I paid for the Shinkansen fare to Nagoya. The cost of 10,000 fireworks, the lighting expenses... What is this person talking about? It's scary. It's so disappointing. Poor you. can't believe he's like this. Sometimes people can be like that. Let me tell you, don't tell anyone else. He said that you would gather information and cling to others. It really made me angry at the time. I'm telling the truth. I'm so angry. Poor you. Omoi, Hi. Bring your seal with you next time you come. I'll talk to him next time. I think he'll listen to me. I'm counting on you. I'm good at influencing people's thoughts. I feel like I've always influenced the values of many people. I've always been interested in psychology. Because I've always been observing humans. Because that's my interest. And â™ª No, I didn't mean that. I'm not lecturing you... What do you want to do then? don't be so angry. What happened to the incarnation of God, Tamamori-san before?? Isn't God someone who doesn't seek rewards? ah?! That's not true. What kind of joke are you making? Of course, I should be rewarded! Isn't that how things should be? Yes, indeed. But that was also quite strange. Is she crazy or something? Yeah, next time I see her, I'll beat her up for you. And do you know what? That woman seems to be sleeping with a famous YouTuber.

Please stop this behavior of adding insult to injury. Anonymous Mr. with the handle GOD.T @@@@@@ Indeed, you did help me a little bit. But it's really nothing significant. Well, just someone who has a little connection with me. Today, to deal with such a despicable person, I'm going to talk about the Anti-Stalking Law! Applause, applause, applause. Mr. @@@@, you should study hard. Let's get started then. The full name of the Anti-Stalking Law is the Law for Restraining Stalking Behavior and Other Related Behaviors. Sorry to interrupt, I have something to ask you. Around last Christmas, was this car scratched? ah yes. Actually, it was a YouTuber named Yuri-chan who was filming a video here at that time. And she threw Captain America's shield onto your car. Captain America? Yes, Captain America's shield. It was a prop for the filming. When she threw it, it hit your car. Then she just left. I was there too, and I suggested she should go to the makeup room. But she said it was no big deal... SU and E How is this possible? It's really nothing! Bring that man here! Bring them to me! I'll bring them, really. Bring them to me! I'll bring them, really. I am Yuri-chan! Today, we have a fantastic group of guests! I'm Rio. - Leno. - I'm Rio. Together, we are RioLeno. So cute! I've always been listening to your songs. Thank you so much. We've also been watching your videos all along. You've been really amazing lately. By the way, GOD.T is really scary, isn't he? Yeah, he's really terrifying. But actually, GOD.T has said that he's a fan of RioLeno~! That's so creepy. The lock screen on his phone is RioLeno. be careful on your way home. Ah, that's so scary. It's really disgusting, dirty, and smelly. I can't stand the smell. Physically, I can't handle it. When he talks, his saliva flies everywhere. When he eats, he keeps talking and spitting. Such a shameless guy. Yeah, how can he be a man? His everyday clothes are ridiculously tacky, but he's extremely narcissistic. The messages he sends are like secondhand poetry. What kind of person is he? Do you want to see? Yes, yes, I want to see. This is the Line message he sent me earlier It's just a review of the movie that he unilaterally sent start reading Indeed this work has Academy Award-winning quality Every scene of the movie has its meaning and is very pleasing to the eye...- It occurred to me that if Yuri-chan and I were characters in the movie So which scene will we be in? Is it about to climax? No matter what difficulties we have, we will have a wonderful happy ending... no we don't end Because no matter how old we are, our journey will never end... Let it go, it's disgusting i can't accept. goosebumps every time You and I will not exist in any scene at all. This is my 8th time. How many times have we performed? Three times, I think. Let's do it more. Five times. Five times. What about Hu? It's the first time, right? Yes, the first time. What about Yuri-chan? it's my first time too. How do you feel right now? I never imagined I would perform here. It feels like a dream come true. I attended the previous events as an audience member. I happened to be in that position. But when there's a computer in front of me, I get nervous. I'm really nervous too. Nervousness is normal. Our conversational skills have improved significantly. Yes, because we've gained a lot of experience. Indeed, you've become an outstanding person. Yes, now I feel like I'm in a different dimension compared to before. Wow, you look handsome. Your words are different now. I'm in a different dimension now. Can you please stop bothering me? You're amazing. You've completely changed. I've grown too. Mr. Tamagami, you're still stagnant, aren't you? It's normal to leave behind people like you when I want to climb higher. So, you have time to hate on me instead. Why don't you think about improving yourself? Also, your videos still lack taste. I suggest you study more. Oh, by the way, how many followers do you have now? You are a jerk! Do you think it's over like this? I just recorded a video of you threatening me! Don't record! What are you doing? Then stop talking. You're causing trouble. Hey, stop it. Don't finish your sentence. This is the women's restroom! Who cares what kind of kitchen this is? It hurts. Hey! Here's 10,000 yen. Thank you. Your change is 2,008 yen. Thank you. Thank you.

They're probably recording somewhere over there. Yuri-chan's real name is Yuri Kawai. She called me here. She's here herself, on-site. You make it impossible for us to have a proper conversation. Anyway, you don't even know where you're shooting, do you? Can you stop acting like this? Anyway, you're only after money, right? How much do you want? I don't want money anymore. I want you to give me back the goodwill and effort I put in What? How is that even possible? And can you stop filming? Give it back to me quickly. Give me back the goodwill I've given!

Are you happy being with someone who has no substance? Huh? They're much better than you! Maybe they have more fans, but they only make childish videos and have a big ego. It's just like dealing with a child! By acting like this, you're actually looking down on content creators! I understand. We're just sensitive to being looked down upon. I don't look down on you. Isn't sympathy different from looking down upon someone? So, it's okay to just pretend to care, right? I don't think that way! Yes, you do! We're breaking our heads for this kind of useless content. When we're annoyed, we can't sleep. Do you have any idea? Of course I know! Then don't diss other people's stuff! Promote what you genuinely like to gain followers! Then you will know how difficult it is! You gain followers by relying on things that people mock. What is this? Is this your desperate effort? Huh? Stop bothering me. You're utterly insufferable! So annoying! I hate people like you too! You're disgusting. What are you filming? Stop filming. What are you filming? You stop filming first. Don't film. Seriously... It would have been better if we never met. What are you joking about? I've had enough! Save me! What? Save me! Sorry. You called me out on your own and now you want to end it by yourself! I know I'm not the key to your success! But... I can say I've been a part of your journey to success. You're Tamamori-san, right? Could you please give me your autograph? Ouch, it hurts! I am keimei.

The fence will look like this, Xiao Huai said Do we really have to organize the GOD.T? Why? Isn't that what you said? Yes but I want to do something else... But we've already placed the order for the fence, and the shed is being built. Is that so? Fine. Excuse me. If I were locked inside the fence, what would you do? I'm just saying "what if." Would that be more interesting? Not interesting at all. Yeah, not interesting at all. sorry not super If I were in a cage with body painting, wouldn't that be different? Indeed, that would be different, but what's the meaning behind it? If you find it interesting, please explain it to me. I'm sorry. I'll cover all the expenses!

But, it's not always something happy that you encounter. Is that so? So, that's the value I find in doing this. But it's not like movies or music, something that can be preserved in the flow of time. So, it feels a bit lonely. I don't really understand either. But is it really amazing if something can be preserved? I really like Yuri-chan's videos, I find them interesting. Could it be that this is the only way to end the game?" No Thank you. Thank you. Can I shake your hand? Thanks - I'll come again. - Thank you. I'll come again. Let's consider it as repayment. Yes.

If you don't behave properly, There will be fewer and fewer people around you. I don't want to be told that by someone like you. What you're saying is an insult to me. Being told this by me, you really are beyond saving. Are you not wrong? What does "beyond saving" mean? Then I'll go back first. I'm hopeless? Have you been waiting long? Is that GOD.T? Thank you for coming. It hurts. Hey, stop it. I'm sorry. what are you doing? - I'm sorry. - What are you doing? Hey! What are you doing? Hey! hello wait Heavens. it hurts! Hey!

Ah, so you guys care about it, huh? Isn't it tacky? But this kind of tackiness, isn't it cute in its own way?
