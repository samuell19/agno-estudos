... Clinking of cymbals and percussion Playful music ... Horn blows -Hello. -Hi my dear. It's okay ? -Well yeah. -So, this fake exam of philosophy? -I will do it. Well, they haven't returned it. You know the teachers, the less they do ... How beautiful you are, mom. Really, you're super beautiful. -Well, thank you. -No, I'm going to do it. - So much kindness ... Do you have something to ask us? -Non. Finally Yes. Do you know the number of plastic bags in the sea? He hesitates. -Non. -A new continent is being formed. -Is that so ? -Yeah. It's dramatic. It's almost the end of the world. -My God, the end of the world. That scares you. Go on, it's exciting. -I applied for the ecological expedition and they selected me. I'm going to Marseille in 10 days. -Excuse me, can you repeat what you said? -It's going to be the end of the world. -No, the thing after. -I will do an ecological expedition. Clean World is a serious association. I'm going in 10 days. -Your cruise will meet a reef. Does the bac remind you of anything? -Dad, it is useless that I pass the bac. I didn't give a damn about the year. I prefer to repeat and work next year. In "I tear everything day and night" mode. That's a great idea. outraged laugh - Yes, it's a great idea. -Ah, did you see? -Well yeah. -So ? -So, well, it's no. -Quoi, "no" ? -Well "no", negation adverb inducing a negative response. -But, to every smart idea, it's no ! -Good then, here it is. We wanted to tell you: we found a hotel, more exactly a hotel on a boat, The Divina, Mediterranean cruise. No, but a golden proposition. We can't refuse, we 've been unemployed for a year. You understand ? -Yes I understand. But precisely, you will be on a boat and me too. On the same sea. If it is, we can even meet. That's it, a modern family, in relaxation mode. -Listen, this is how I see "the modern family in relaxation mode": on the one hand, mom and dad work, and on the other, children go to school. -It sucks. Anyway, I won't have it. - Honey, you just have to get started and you will get it. Last year, you had great grades. -But that was last year. What do I do now? What is the story , actually? -Well, that's what we wanted to tell you ... So... To accompany you ... -Papi André. -Papi André? Camille laughs loudly. Papi André? It's funny. It's a good joke. -It's no joke, it's coming tomorrow. -I hate you. -Plastic bags, OK. Flashlight, its good. Calgon, textile stain remover, OK. First aid kit, it's good. Batteries... The batteries: then R6, OK. R12, it's good. Button cell, its good. And my steamer. Impeccable, there is more than. Here we go. Military march ... Call tone * -Hello, you're on Franck Morales' cell phone, * leave me a message after the beep. -Son, he's your father. To tell you that I'm taking off from Saint-Nazaire, it's 7:50 am, arrival on site planned around 11:12 am. There, report finished. He starts the car. Let's go. * -It is at 10am sharp that the President of the Republic will come * at the tomb of the Unknown Soldier, in the presence of the Chief of Staff * and the representative of the veterans association, * that we listen to on our microphone. -Go, my daughter! Stand up, there is a job! -What time is it ? -The time to tidy up your room, do your homework ... Come on. -What are you doing ? -I hand over the books offered by your grandfather: De Gaulle , History of France ... -Are you serious ? -It must make him believe that you love his gifts. OKAY ? -OKAY. You will tell him that I am over 15 years old and do what I want. -Franck, I'm handing over your father's lamps. And I took you out the T-shirt. Last year's gift. -Ah not ... -Ah well yes. -Fuck... It seems that it is the president who arrives. -Yeah, not far. - Old idiot in an old idiot car. To me, 40 years of police. -Hello anyway. -Yeah, hello, son. Driving cell phone, fishtail, Nobel Prize. - It's okay, Dad, there is no dead man. -If we wait for that to enforce the highway code, it's without me. It becomes anything, this country. Damn bullshit to have suppressed the national service. -Hello. I see that you are in great shape. -Yes, in great shape. -Leave it, I'll take it. -We put you in the guest room, you have your bathroom. -You see it looks good on you, this T-shirt. -I tell her all the time. -I was afraid of the size. Tell me, it is a beautiful house for the unemployed. -Yeah, we're fine. It's temporary. It belongs to Karine's father. He leaves it for us while we turn around. Are you going to stack again? -Non. I contacted the head of the departmental group of the gendarmerie. It's not far from here. And imagine, he served under my orders, younger. I'm going to bring Camille lunch to the officers' mess for her to see that. -She will love ... -Well I hope. Where is she, by the way? -went lokking for a wetsuit. It's his new thing, it took him yesterday. Suddenly like that. -Surf ? Well why not. If she works well in high school ... -Yes, it's not bad. But do not let go. -Do you know me. -If I can afford to, take it easy. She has her character. And then it's been a long time. -2 ½ years. It's not for lack of inviting you to come. Each time, you were taken. Does high school know that I'm taking over? -They have your contact details. -It's good, you are progressing in organization. Phone -You take, please? -Yes sir. -I did not understand your wife's message. -No nothing. It's just that Camille is over 15 and a half, it is in its "I rebel against the system" period. Be cool. -Do not worry. Since the death of your mother, I have relaxed a lot. - So much the better. - Let's move on to practical things. Insurance contracts, warranties and operating instructions for the devices and phone numbers important: EDF, GDF, family doctor, hospital ... The base, what. -Well softened ... -And now, supplies. -Franck. It's the cat, the cat, the cat. Don't worry, it won't stay long, 2-3 days. -He can stay as long as he wants. He is still at home. And I am delighted to meet your papa, my dear daughter-in-law. In 18 years, we have never seen each other. In any case, it must pay off, the trade cocoa. -Good, I still have to warn you. My father is a bit of a character ... -Particular. -Here. You may be surprised. -Surprised ? After 40 years of gendarmerie, nothing surprises me anymore. -NOT SURE. Klaxon original Jazzy music -Oh, ma Karinette! How is she ? He's laughing. -It's okay ? -Oh, how beautiful you are. But yes, it's fine, darling. And you ? -Yes. -Oh, I'm glad to see you. -Has my stepfather, haven't you forgotten? -No, I haven't forgotten. -André. -André, yes. -You're going easy, huh? -Ah, my favorite son-in-law, how is he? Tell me, it’s going up there. -Yes. -André, I present my father, Teddy. -Are you the famous André? Hi, André. -Good morning, Teddy. -I settle in, we don't waste time and we start the aperitif. And hop, hop, hop! I'm glad to be there! Happy, happy, happy. -Ben me, I will prepare the aperitif. -He is really nice. - At the bottom of this box Ah, we are so tight Ah, we are so close Hey, Dede! Dede! The bearded woman! He's laughing. (-The bearded woman ...) -I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming. Come here, my grandfather. It's happy hour. Oh, you're tired, huh? Hey, honey. She still collects them? -Dad, she grew up, she is over 12 years old. -It is not serious. Come on! He will stay there, my grandfather. He must be tired, the road has been long. Dad is coming back soon. I'm going to have an aperitif. Ah, the brothel in town, my André. You would have seen that ... They piss us off with their commemoration. -It is a historic day: May 8, 1945, De Gaulle ... -A historic day? De Gaulle ... He was the only one who stayed in London to resist. "Here London, here London ..." You mean something. He didn't wet the shirt much, cushy. Fortunately there were the Ricans to land on the beaches of Normandy. The great Charles ... Charles is waiting. Okay, come on. A little rosé, my Dédé? -No thanks, never drink alcohol at noon. I'm going to have a little lemonade. -It's public holiday. -It's not a question of the day. It's a matter of principle. And if you could stop calling me "my Dede", that would be nice. - At your orders, captain. Does it suit you ? -No more. André, it will be perfect. In addition, it's good, it's my first name. -Very well. Very, very, very well. So meet us, André. "Drink wine, you will have friends. "Health, but not feet." -I see that you have met. Muffled nods -I took you 2 months subscription, you can watch football. -You could have saved ... Soccer, I watch more. The players who contest the arbitration, that bugs me. No more. -Papa was an referee at the time. -Oh ok. You must have put red cards. -Some. -Hi everyone. Papi Teddy! What are you doing here ? -Return to the country, the holidays, my darling. What have you changed! How cute you are. -Thanks, that's nice. You have grown old. - Hey oh, say so! -I'm joking. Hi, grandpa. - How are you, my beauty? He is right. You have become magnificent. A pure Morales. Huh? Laughs -It's good, did you recover? -Yeah, great. -Are you ok? You didn't miss your arrival there. -You told me "discreetly", I arrived discreetly. They laugh. -It didn't last long, with your Mexican. -2 months, hey oh. It's not bad, 2 months. On the other hand, as a welcome gift, the energetic who serves as your stepfather ... I don't know where it comes from, but it's gratin. - Well, he leaves the gendarmerie. -Ah yes, okay ... I understand everything. -And I don't know how long you are going to stay, but try to be cool with him, huh? And then you have to know ... we always lied to him about you. -Why ? -Son, it's not going to be that simple, this cohabitation. Wait, the guy I just saw ... With his big motorbike, his big teddy bear on his back, who fucks a liter of red while drooling on the Republic before going to sleep in his trailer. I'm not sure if he's a specialist in the cocoa trade. Franck sighs. -Listen, be cool. In addition, he is at home. So put some of your own on it. You're here for Camille. The bac, the bac, the bac. -Yes I understood. But I prefer to warn. At the slightest hiccup, at the slightest lack of respect, it's back home. I didn't come here to sort the lentils, OK? -OK. -I understood, the bac, the bac, the bac. But I'm here to recharge my batteries, home. Then explain to the gendarme of Saint-Tropez, that at the slightest problem, it's back to the direct barracks. -My dear Karine, planes are not waiting for passengers to take off. In addition, the ring road of Bordeaux is red, so we hurry. -Ah ok ... "Gratiné", it's just the first name. -Oh, dad. Come on, I have to go there. -Yes. Hello, my love. -You promise me, huh? Papa. -I'm going to try. Horn blows -Do not make that head. -Well excuse me ... -The plane is at 4:45 pm, children, come on! -I love you. I love you I love you. -Me too. ... -go, go, go! -André, it's okay, I know it's 4:45 p.m. We are starting to know. Lounge music ... -Putain, two grandfathers and a bac, it's anxiety. I'm not going to have to piss me off. -And your 1st surf lesson? -I stop. It's finish. It's not for me. Neither do the surfers. How they hunt in the water, whew thing. -It's not only in the water. In the sand too. Since this morning, it turns. -Yeah... What is that ? Damn, it's heavy. I can't take surfing anymore. -Hello. -Ah, hi. -Are you looking for a board? You’re new, right? -Ah no, no. Not at all. I dream. I was looking for my board, this is it, the blue one. -OKAY. What's your name ? -Camille. And you ? -Paco. Are you going to surf? -Well yeah. Finally no, I'm finished. -It's not that great today. It closes, it sucks. -It closes serious. Serious. -This weekend, there are waves at Messanges, there is an east wind. -Ah yeah, the east wind. -East wind. -East wind. Ah, well yes, you're right. Exactly, I was planning to go. -Cool. Maybe this weekend, then. -Well yeah. To this weekend. -Uh ... So Camille ... -Yes ? -You took my board. -Ah... Ah, this is your board. It's a wack thing. In fact, you and I have the same. But yes, it's ... It's a wack thing. See you. (You're serious, daughter.) (You're ridiculous.) - "Drink wine, you will have friends." This is clever. - Hi, grandpa. Are you okay, my little girl? -Yeah. Well, check. -Check what? - Raise your arm, type. Here. -Check. He's laughing. -What do you do to eat? -So, salmon papillotes, steamed carrots, spinach and leeks. Only very good for your health. -I'm not sure. -What do you mean ? -Did you keep the packaging? -In the trash, yes. -I will show you. So wait ... It is an application. You take a picture of the barcode and it gives you the composition. -An application ... -Well yeah. So... "Raised in Norway, in the Baltic, "very polluted sea, "fed on processed flours." Great ! In fact, your fish is poison. -I've been eating it for years, I'm not dead. Go take your shower, we have to talk after. Come on. -Lussa! -Ah not. We say more "lussa", it's cheesy. -Oh yeah ? And wesh wesh? That's good ? -No more, but it does not matter, I will give you a speech. -André, what is there to peck? I have one of these tiles. -Stuffed salmon and steamed vegetables. -We're not in the hospital, oh! Let's see in there. Wow there ... Leeks, carrots, turnips, salsify. It still exists, salsify? Teddy rit. It makes you want to go straight to the restaurant. -It's for the little one. When you eat well, you sleep well and you work well. -Yes, but I spent 2 years in Mexico eating tacos. What I dream of is a good rib of beef and smelly cheese. -I see. In this case, you have to do your shopping yourself. - I count on that, my captain. -I don't know how it goes in Mexico, but in France, food stores are open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m., right in your sleep hours. It's not pratical. Funny outfit to sell cocoa. -Listen, my dear André, we're going to clear things up, definitely. I don't know what the kids said, but for 40 years I've been running night clubs. They pay me dearly for that. Thanks to this money, I bought this house in which you live today. -It has the merit of being clear. -Very clear. "Tata Yoyo" ringtone Hop, hop. Tata Yoyo! ... Business resumes. Yeah, Roberto. How is it going ? -Noura, I tried everything. "Paco surfer", "Paco beach" ... Someone knocked. -I can enter ? -Yeah yeah. (You know what, I'll call you back.) -You haven't eaten anything. -I'm not very hungry tonight. But worry, grandpa, everything is fine. -If there is an application which arranges the rooms, do not hesitate. -It's funny, grandpa. There it is stored. -Do you call that "tidy", you? When you have 5 min, look in the dictionary for the definition. -Ben OK. -What are you doing ? -Well I look. -What? -Google "ranger". So: "arrange things in a specific order". That's what I do. But it is I who determine the order of storage. -Okay ... -Good , papi. Tell me everything, I'm listening to you. -Did you look on your desk? -No. -Come see. So, here is the device: we have 41 full days before the start of the tests. This is the plan of attack. One color per material, the same colors as your notebooks. Right column, all the subjects of each subject. Left column, it's days. So listen to me carefully: if you work 4 hours a day in the order I wrote on each of the annals and if you check off the days as you go in the boxes here, the day before bac, you will have reviewed everything. It's automatic. Provided, of course, to start tomorrow. -No. No, please, grandpa, not tomorrow ... Give me another 2 or 3 days. We're going to Messanges. -What Messanges? Where does it come from? -My friends are surfing and an east wind returns to Messanges. And that will be "wow". -The east wind will return alone on Messanges, and you, you stay here. That's what's going to be "wow". -Well no, because grandpa Teddy told me yes. -Has he told you that? -Well when you were at the airport. -Camille, it is to me that your parents entrusted the mission. If you have claims, call them and see it with them. -Ah well, that's smart. -Camille, you have 2 months to give your all, afterwards you will do what you want when you want. -But papi, 2 months is forever. -It's like that, you have no choice. So I sum it all up: goal, strategy, timing. Why not mention it. -Yes... -Tomorrow, I accompany you to make a location. -No, it's okay. I can go alone. - I accompany you anyway. -Oh, anxiety. Latin music -A policeman, buddy. -A policeman ? At your home ? -And a real prototype of the gendarme. I want to piss him off. Having said that, I'm not going to be shy. -It changes you a little. Usually you sleep in their house. Okay, well. History that you are not on the street. That's nice thanks. And thank you for the bike. -With everything you did for me ... Come on, let's have a little. Mickey, two mojitos. And your Mexican? -shaved cleaned, a real tsunami. I fucked up. -I don't ask you how. -No, don't ask. -What will you do now ? -I don't know, I don't know. I'm tired, Roberto. I am tired. -Go. Here you are at home. You come when you want. -How nice. -Good, hey! At night and all that it destroys in us. - Yours, buddy. -Well. Excuse me, but there, dad is going back on track. Rose ! Tango ! Tango music ... -Oh fuck, Lily. ... Lily! Come back here! They laugh. There is a tradition here before leaving. You put yourself there and I take your picture memory. There you go, darling. Oh, you're beautiful like a heart. ... Come on, I'll take you home. They laugh again. ... How is he, captain this morning? -Very well thank you. He got up early. He prepared a breakfast for his granddaughter, he went shopping. A lot of things people do. -It's good, all that, it's very good. -You mix colors? -Yes why ? -Because not, it can rub off. -What counts in the T-shirt is the T-shirt, not the color. Let it become brown, yellow, green, I don't care, it's not going to change my life. I'm going to make my little machine at 95 degrees and everything will be fine. -Me, I would put a Calgon. The water is hard here. I know it's not going to change your life, but it will avoid buying a machine. Teddy laughs yellow. -Listen, thank you for your advice, captain, but i will make my machine at 95 degrees where I mix white and colors and without Calgon. You know why ? -No. -Because here, I'm at home. So I do what I want with my machine and my laundry. -What I'm saying is for you. -My dear André, instead of giving laundry lessons, avoid accompanying the little girl to high school. To be dropped off by your grandfather is shame. I say that, it's for you. I'm going to bed while it turns. Funny music Yes ? - Let's put the dots on the I and the bars on the T. First, what is most shameful: a caring grandfather or a grandfather who spends his nights in a nightclub? And I'm not talking to you this morning. Secondly, I was responsible for the "Camille's bac" mission. We agree ? -Yes. -So when you say "yes" to Camille, I would like to know before. -What are you talking about ? I said nothing. -And a liar too. I'm warning you, do not hinder the smooth running of this mission. Otherwise, I call your daughter illico and I go back to Saint-Nazaire. I'm not here to play bearded women. Received ? -Received 5 of 5. However, stop bothering me while I try to go back to sleep. I have a job. I don't spend my time checking who puts Calgon in the machine. Huh, Mister Helico! Imitation of helicopter blades (-But he's crazy, this guy.) -His program is hell. -I will make your notebooks. -No way. I will find a solution. -It's non-negotiable, I owe you that. And for Messanges, my father lent me his car. -Do you have a license? -It's unlicensed. How are you going to do? -I have my little idea. -You go there. Hello sir. -Hello Madam. -You look for ? -My granddaughter is passing her baccalaureate soon, I'm looking for books support, methods ... -Yes, yes. I have a great book on the method and psychology of approach to the bac exams. It's an old book, but ... It is very well done. What high school is she at? -Lucie Aubrac. -I know. I was the director of this high school ten years ago. Before working at the rectorate. Are you from the area? -No, I live around Saint-Nazaire. -Loire-Atlantique, 44. It's great. Ah yes. That's it, I have it. Corridor B, row 4, shelf 5. Come with me. You would not be a former soldier? -Gendarme. Captain of the gendarmerie, more precisely. And how... -The look, the frank look ... My ex-husband was a soldier, I spent my life in barracks, so ... So, row 4, shelf 5 ... Where are you ? Where are you ? You are the. So. The little exit voucher ... -What body was your ex-husband in? - At the start, it was the French Navy, but considering the number of times I've been cuckolded, it has been in many bodies. Here, fill this for me. Name, address, telephone number. My name is Viviane. -Nice to meet you. André. -André. Someone knocked. -Start, Camille, it's time! It's 6:45 am, we get up! The shower, the teeth. -The nightmare ! No ! -Go, France is waiting for you! Explain to me the difference between 6:45 and 7:00. All this for 15 min of sleep. -It's psychological, you can't understand. 6:45, and a 6 in premier. 7am, there is a 7. -Yes. -It's like the prices. A dress at 79 euros, you buy it. A dress at 80 ... You don't buy it. -I didn't come here to buy a dress. Let's go. She imitates him. Are there any other shopping carts? -No, it's that of grandpa Teddy. -No kidding... -It suits you. -Yeah... -Oh, my nasturtium! He's laughing. Daddy came back! Yes, come here, my heart! Nasturtium! At the foot! At the foot, Capucine. Come see dad! -It was missing more than that ... Magnificent, everything is there. If with that, you don't have a good grade in the bac ... I'm proud of you. Did you do that during the day? -Well yeah, in high school. And I did my math too. You want to see ? It's on logarithms natural. -No, it's okay, no. -Ah, and grandpa. Thanks for the book, it looks super interesting. -Yeah. -Yeah, really. -Here. -What's this ? -The drawings you did when you were little. I'll stick it on the wall, if you want. She laughs. -Ah yeah, damn. I was not good. Is it grandma? -Yes. -But how old was I? -7 years. The age when you were still cuddling me. -Papi, I am over 7 years old. Besides, I had mom and dad on the phone. I’m free, they’re on a too beautiful ocean liner. But like whew. Look. -They are good, both of them. That's why we have to work, if one day you want to buy yourself a boat. I hope you take me. -You will already be dead. But I'm kidding. The head that you made. But of course I will bring you. I will need a captain. Ah, grandpa. You have to sign a word. -What's this ? -The school wants to stop the canteen because of the exams. It makes no sense. -Yes. -There, the printer. -So... "Sir, madam ... "Due to an organizational problem, "the canteen will be closed ..." Closed, mascunile instead of feminine? He's laughing. -They are light in spelling. OK. Here. Here. -Thank you. Doorbell -Who is that? - Don't worry, it's for me. -It's a shame to order a pizza when there are lots of good things. -Sorry, grandpa, but I don't like carrots or turnips. I don't like spinach, and even less green beans. he sings "Tata Yoyo". Are you okay, grandpa? He nods. You look tense. -Not at all. ... -Hello everyone ! It's okay ? -What is the bag on the table? - Pillows. - Pillows? -Yes, that makes sense. A sleeping man, he buys pillows. They laugh. -Very funny, that one, my captain. I have one: Mr. and Mrs. Donctoilabas have a son. Eddy. Hey, tell yourself over there. They laugh. It’s good, right? Doesn't she make you laugh, captain? A good touch of red. are you ready for the baccalaureate ? -sure. Well. I didn't tell you, Camille, but if you need help, I'm here. French, math, I assure well, as you say. André mumbles. What? Yes, well ... Glue me a super complicated addition. We'll have some fun. -Well, OK. Come on. Randomly ... Randomly ... plus 594. -2 350. -Yeah, that's it. -Hey, she asked me the question. -Yes, but it escaped me. -You escaped it, yes ... Here, stick another one on me. You give me time to respond. -OK. Uh, 437 plus 941. -437 more 941. easy. So wait ... -Go, 1378 because it's too long. -Oh ... No, but it is too strong. -It's too strong, it's too strong ... -What is this mess? -What? What a mess? -I said, "The vegetables downstairs." -Ben me, I put them up, it does not matter. -If it's serious. Things are a matter of order or disorder. -André, from disorder, great revolutions are born. -But there, we are not making the revolution. We put leeks and sausage. Speaking of leeks, Capucine has more carrots. -Tomorrow morning you get up very early. You go to the market. A stand sells vegetables. It is next to the church, you can't miss it. There they sell carrots, about 1 euro per kilo. And in a kilo, there are 7 or 8 carrots. Up to you. -I'm dealing with a carrot statistician . -No, to a man who goes shopping. -It's okay ? Is it going well between you? -Ben... Impeccable. Huh, André? - Absolutely, yes. Embarrassed laugh - Why? -Like that. By the way, you two are wrong. Vegetables are not stored in the fridge. -How do you know that ? You hate this. -Google "vegetables". Just read. So... "Stop the storage of fruits and vegetables "in the fridge". It kills flavors. - Too bad you don't have your Google for the bac. -Ah, by the way, grandpa. Don't worry if I come home late, I'm going to work at a friend's house. -No problem Darling. - "Speak to the butcher, the andouille responds." -Sorry I did not understand. I did not hear. -I was talking to myself. Who is your girlfriend? -Noura. She is a classy friend. -Very well. Are his parents? -Has father, it's his week. His parents are divorced. -What is he doing, father? -He is a surgeon. -You will give me her number. -To do what ? -To call. -But papi ... You're not going to call him while he's operating. -Why do you always roll your eyes? It is crisp. -I have had this jerk since childhood. I can not do anything about it. I do that... All the time. And then, it sucks not to trust him. -I trust him, only one, it doesn't exclude control, and two, it's a matter of principle. I see it this way. -It sucks, grandpa. That's not cool. In addition, I do not stop working with notebooks. -It's true, she doesn't stop working. Hey, André, now, must let go. -Okay. Well. I trust you. I hope I don't regret it. -Oh, thank you, grandpa. -Say, hey! Would you like to take you to school tomorrow on a motorcycle ? -Grave, too good idea! -You're awesome ! Come on, check. Raise your hand. Bam. Kisses everyone and good night. - Wasn't it shameful that his grandfather took him to high school? -Not in Harley, you understand? -Non. -Don't forget the SMS, in 30 seconds, as we said. -It's a zebra today ... Tango music -She left ? -Of course, did you see the time? -You could have woken me up. -She drummed on your door. You were busy to something else. -Very funny. -She took her moped, I did not accompany her in Cactus. -And that, you explain to me? -I have an appointment for lunch with Commander Cousto. And between officers, tradition is the uniform. -Especially with Commander Cousto! -COUSTO. To avoid end of meal jokes. - I would not dare, my captain. Frankly, I would not dare. Notification Ah, a text. I don't know who it can be. My granddaughter, precisely. "My very dear adored grandpa, no big deal for this morning." There is nothing to make a cheese out of. "I'm waiting for lunch, I'll be in front of the school. "I love you." Well, there you go. My darling. Come on, have a good lunch, captain, with Commander Cousto. C-O-U-S-T-O. He's laughing. (-Poor boy.) -Sonia! My little snake, come quickly! Perfect. I drop you. Come on. My little snake. He imitates the snake. -A snake, now. It's not a caravan it has, it's a zoo. -I don't believe it, is it my grandfather? - Which of the two, that one? -It's papi the clown. Cathedral bell ringing And there, papi le relou. I don't know what he wants. Hello, grandpa. Yes, how are you, why? Tonight ? After school ? Wait, buy dresses? But grandpa, I don't have time for shopping. OK that works. See you tonight. I don't know what they have, but it's not going to be possible. -They are fighting for you. -I will settle that or it will be hell. Mouse. Hi, grandpa. -Are you ok, darling? -I'm fine and you ? -Very well. -It's Noura, my girlfriend. -Ah, Noura, nice to meet you. Salut, Noura. -A second time. And... -And there. Okay, is there anything else? Okay, very good. -Why are you there ? -I wanted to apologize for not waking up this morning. I don't know what happened. I turned on the alarm clock and ... Breakdown. -It is not serious. -If it's serious. So, I invite you to lunch. -Ah well, that's nice, thank you. What is that ? -That? A grand piano. Camille laughs. (Laugh, laugh.) (I told you.) -What did you tell him ? -Nothing. Thanks for the board. -You're welcome. It's the same as Kelly Slater. You're going to make waves, darling. Why are you laughing ? -For nothing, you make me laugh. Sonnerie "Tata Yoyo" Grandpa ! But papi! Change that! Please, shame. -What shame? It's all my childhood. Do you know Annie Cordy? Tata Yoyo, what's under your big hat? Besides, when I see the kids, all these little kids, there is not one with whom you ... Non ? -No, I don't have a boyfriend right now. You know, with the bac ... Papi's notebooks are hard ... -Whose fault is it ? Thank you parents. -Besides, speaking of grandpa ... -Yes. (-I can tell you a secret ?) -Yes. -You promise never to say I told you? -Your grandfather, it's a grave. -This morning, when you did not get up, he said you were a slacker, a good for nothing. And he added "with a big coat in the hand". -A slacker ? With a big coat in your hand? Outraged laughter No, but I dream. I'm going to party her, at the police station. He doesn't know who he's dealing with. Uncle Teddy. No, but I don't believe so. A bit in my hand, me? A door slams. Can I talk to you for a minute? -Yes of course. -How was lunch with Commander Cousto? -Very well thank you. And you, with Camille? -Very well. We laughed a lot. I love my granddaughter. -Our granddaughter, if you don't mind. -If you want, our granddaughter. Don't take it the wrong way, but I think she gets more from me than from you. -If I judge by his academic results , I'm not sure. -You know, you are wrong to take me for a fool. I know all the French words. Concupiscence, esperluette, gourgandine, ornithorynque... I was a Scrabble champion. It can't be seen, but I sent. Here, "zloty": Polish currency. ZY, you put that on a triple, it gives you 60 points at once. -It is not because we know words that we know how to make sentences. -In any case, I learned a lot during this lunch, on lazy people with big hairs in their hands. -I don't know what you're talking about. -Ah ... Ah ... Captain Courage, too. It rocks in my back and there, nothing. -What do I throw in your back? -I understand myself. Its good. And There you go. -Your pants, is it a heritage or do you really wear them ? -No, I wash them and I watch them. Of course it's my pants! These are my briefs for the week. Monday, Tuesday, until Sunday. -And at what 6. -The 7th, it's on me. It's his little brother, with the ears. Do you want to see the trunk? -It's elegant ... Braiments Ah, your friend is asking for her carrot. When we see you together, you make a perfect couple. On one side, there is the donkey and on the other, the hat. Forced laughter -Oh there, it's great comics in the gendarmerie. -We cling. (-Yeah, hang on. You're not done.) - Damn, it's shame. -Are you still on that? -Yes. -Stop, it's okay. Besides, I wouldn't have thought of revising that. So thank you, grandpa André. None of them will land? -We're quiet for today. There, it's automatic programming of the washing machine. Don't worry. I organized everything. Machine roar ... -What is that ? Rhythmic music ... -Yes that's why ? -You launched the machine? -No why ? -95 degrees, mixed colors, my underwear is pink. -I can lend you my pants, If you want. It's not me. -Ah, it's not you, it's Santa Claus. I see your game, you want me to go. -Do you think I have that to do? Go take care Camille's bac, don't bother me with your laundry. -Justly, I see your game with it, to give him gifts ... A surfboard, like it's time. -I am no longer allowed to give Camille gifts ? What is he doing there, captain? He forgot what I told him? Start by backing up. Where's my shaving foam? Here it is. Back up there. Back up, back down. Go ahead, again. Again and again. Here. There, it's perfect. There you go. At nine meters, Mr. Referee. Here I distribute the red cards. Consider yourself happy to have the rest of the house. I'm at home here! Hein ! (-You want war, my little cushy?) (Hey, you ran into a colleague there.) (You shouldn't have woken up Captain Morales.) Groovy music ... -It's him ! Noura! Come see. He's there. ... What should I say already? -Two tubes and a cut back, OK? They rehearse together. OKAY ? -OK, you go-y. -You are the best ? -I am the best. I am the best. Two tubes, one cut back. Two tubes, one cut back. -Hey oh, Camille! Camille! Hey ! Camille. Camille. -Oh, Paco. You're here ? -Were you able to come finally? -Yeah, waves like that, it is not missed. -I didn't see you surf. -Normal, I surfed everything there. -Oh yeah ? -I prefer to be alone. And I made two tubes and a cut back. -With these waves, you have to be balese ... -Yeah, well ... It was little tubes. You see, tubettes. - Tubettes ... He's laughing. And you surf in flip flops? -Uh ... Yeah, I feel better on the board. It is a new technique. -This evening, we have an aperitif, you want to come? We are making a spot on Saint-Girons. I invite you. -Yeah, but... If I'm not in the water, why not ... -No, you won't be there. There are more waves. Or just for beginners. -Well then, I'm coming. OKAY. If you insist. -Cool. See you tonight then. -OK, see you tonight. -But your flip-flops, my daughter! Your flip flops! Not possible ! Soft piano music * - Hi, community, let’s introduce someone. Frankly, it's a meeting animal. Noura, Noura. Her name is Noura. * This is the people who follow us. We're going to do an inventory, will you? -He looks funny, your cousin. -Doudou, it's a phenomenon. -You are going to do all the spots in Europe? -Well yeah. Relaxation, what. - Are you going to collect plastic? He hesitates. -No, no, not necessarily. -Well, it sucks. Waiting for the waves. I got a master's degree in international business. -Oh yeah anyway... - Suddenly, I am in quiet mode, rest. -Me too. I am at Sciences Po Bordeaux, 3rd year. -Are you at Sciences Po Bordeaux? -Well yeah. -And in addition, you surf in flip flops! -It's okay. It was to try. I have to go. -OKAY. Are you coming back tomorrow? -I don't really know, you know. Sciences Po, it's hot, there is a job. Soft music But if you really want me to come back, I come. Tell me, that's it. "Camille, I want to see you again tomorrow." It's simple. -But I dream! -Well go. I wait. -I want you to come back tomorrow. -Not too keen ... -OK, OK, OK. Camille Morales, I really want you to come back tomorrow. Are you ok? -Hey, well! Well done ! Oh fuck ! You are shy. Good after, I promise you nothing. I am responsible for families at the moment. I have to take care of my two senile grandfathers. It is awful to age. They can't do anything on their own. Roaring mower ... (Yelling) -Oh! Oh ! It's not over, this mess? Some are sleeping, shit! Oh ! (Quieter) I'm fine, I understand ... You'll see. The door slams. Snoring ... (The little birds, come.) (how, how, how. Whose Whose Whose Whose Which.) He whistles like a blackbird. Funny music -The little villain ... Shouldn't touch my Cactus. The car was not necessary! -Where are the two grandpas? -It is nonsense. I started to heat them and we are reaching new heights. We will be quiet for a while. (-Yes, go get your teddy bear.) (Come on, go to sleep, you can do that.) (Operation destruction, my little coconut.) The bike is struggling to start. -Why doesn't it start? ... Wheels on the ground Sugar in the tank? Are you sure, Roberto? Teddy laughs. The man with leeks ... Shouldn't touch my bike, buddy. To cunt, cunt and a half. You will see the policeman, your Cactus! Take it in your ass! And 5! 8 ! And 14! And bang! In your ass, the permit! -CHI-FOU-MI! CHI-FOU-MI! CHI-FOU-MI! -Bam, I won! Ah, I knew it. She laughs. -Good game. -I know, I'm too strong. -Ah, damn. -Do you have something in your eye? Don't put your hands. -Yeah, but it's there. Soft music ... It blows. -Its good ? -Yes. -I saved your life. How often do you hit the grain of sand? It's a surfer thing, that's for sure. -No. -At least I make you laugh. -I must tell you something. We're leaving for Spain tomorrow. -It's cool. -You can come after your exams. -Yeah... -We celebrate our departure tonight. We're going to the Excalibur. -I will see, I promise you nothing. -You still haven't told her anything? Are you serious ? -Did you see the cunt? And I'm not going there tonight. -If, you're going to go and you're going to tell him the truth. -Ah no, rather die. No no. Did you see the guy's profile? It will flash me in 2 seconds. I stop, it's shame. I pissed off everyone for nothing. Thank you. -What are you doing, Miss Morales? -You see, I am leaving. -You must stay. -Why ? -This is the regulation. -So we have to stay 4 hours when we don't know what to write? -Yes. -Well no. (-she's phew.) -Do you know where it will end? -I do not care. The door slams. -You fell out of bed. -I just got home. I slept, do you mind? -No, it's your business. Phone ring Yes ? Absolutely. No, Camille is not there. What do you mean "she left high school"? I arrive immediately, just the time to arrive. Okay, Madam. -What is happening ? -Nothing. -My granddaughter disappears, it's up to me! I will call her! -You should know that she doesn't have phone anymore. -that's small. -Where are you going there? -With you. -No, that's my problem. Huh, mister "you have to trust him". she got you. -Of course! I point out to you that the mission was entrusted to you. Open that door! Open that door for me! Tire squealing Do you want to play it like that? You'll see. Groovy music ... -Hello. Grandfather of Camille Morales, I come to see the director. -It is building B, ground floor. -Good, thanks. -Hello. Grandfather of Camille Morales, I come to see the director. -It's not possible, he just left. -But how many grandfathers do you have? -Well two. -That's it. The second one is there. Come on, hop. Oh, Morales. Did you mean to dump me like that? I know the shortcuts here! It's my country. - Take them back quickly to take care of your briefs. I'll take care of the basics, Camille. -I am also his grandfather! Put it in your head. -You know what I think, so don't heat me up! -I'm not afraid, sir "I put sugar in the tank". It's lousy to do that. -Put bread on the Cactus, it is not shabby? -You started. -No, it's you. Aren't you going to go see the director dressed like a clown? We are not at the circus. -A clown ? -Yes. Besides, where is your red nose? -You will see, red nose, he will stick you a live one! If you've never tasted my praline, I have a box. -Is that what you want ? -Yeah. Go ahead, put them on, your glasses! Come come ! -You want Mickey's head? Do you like mashed potatoes? Because you're going to eat it! -Oh yeah ? Mashed potatoes, me? You'll see ! Heckling ... Come, come. -Look at it, Bozo the clown! It's Bozo the clown. -You are the two grandfathers of Camille, that's it ? -Yes. Paternal and maternal. -And you fought in the yard? -Not at all. Not at all! We do that for fun , it was to amuse the kids. It's our thing, both of us. We play gendarmes and thieves. Right, André? -Absolutely. - To the gendarmes and thieves ... -Yes Yes. -And why not cowboys and Indians? sorry? I'm going to play the director and the two grandfathers. You are aware of the situation ? -Yes ... well, what situation? -Camilla Morales, absent 8 days out of the last 10, with words signed by one of you. A. Morales. -It's him. -It's me. -Is it your signature? Teddy acquiesce. -I can know why all these absences, Mr. Morales? -I will explain to you. She refuses. -I gave you the floor? -No Madam. -So you raise your hand. I'm listening to you. -In fact, we keep it at home to have it revised. And we put the package, I can tell you ... The bin, the bin, the bin, we don't stop. And it gives satisfactory results. We are amazed by the quality of his work, of the high level. -By his work? -Yes. -Before leaving, the parents did not inform you? -NO. -7 overall average in the 1st quarter. 5.5 to 2nd, rehaersal bac dismal. Already two warnings and a completely casual and sassy attitude . The board is black. -YES. -I will explain the rest to you, gendarmes and thieves. It's simple, Camille is excluded from high school. Definitely. This will save you from saying words to her. And I advise her to have her baccalaureate. Because if she doesn't have it, there will be no room for her next year. It's clear ? Ringtone "Les sardines" by Patrick Sébastien ... (-Here...) (It was Les sardines .) It's not my fault that it rang. Fortunately, I had changed the ringtone. -You tire me. Yes, son, you need to call me straight away. Here it’s not going well at all, at all. -And thank you for your help, not a word. I don't know what you were thinking, but thank you. -Do you know what I was thinking? We should never leave Saint-Nazaire. - Hello, excuse me. Can i talk to you? -I don't know about you, but there is no question of letting it pass. -For once, we agree, my dear Teddy. We're going to give him a booster shot. -Exactly. My father said: "To take us for trumpets, we harvest the storm." -If you come to yell at me, go. -What's it, don't you think? It's hard to pass, all of that. -A lot of trouble getting through. -I'm sorry. I lied to have peace, that's all. -You are all there: "The bac, the bac!" -Yes. -I don't care about the bac. -We understand for the bac, but for the rest, it is inadmissible! Huh? -Absolutely. -Your grandfather agrees with me. Because we... Camille, we're not at all happy at all ! But then not at all! Huh, André? -Affirmative. -Here. Affirmative. -Inadmissible... Have you seen each other? I saw your fight on Facebook! There are already 2 million views! I had to block mom and dad, it's so shameful. "Come here !" "Where's your nose, Bozo the clown?" Papi ? Did you put sugar in the tank of his motorcycle? -He started. -Not at all ! Oh ! -That's it. They look like 5 year old kids. So now, you better get along or I'm leaving. But really. Soft music ... -Hello. -Hello. ... -There was no wine, I bought some. It is said to be very good. -How nice. I bought you a gift. -To me ? -Yeah. As you like jogging, I took you a sweatshirt. I took green, it's more joyful. -How nice. It is very good. Very well. Thank you so much. *They speak. *... She sobs. * -You hurt my nose! *... (-I'll let you talk to him.) (I never knew what to say in those moments.) * -Ah, you're yucky! -Tell me, he's a handsome kid. - It's okay, it's good. Leave me alone. -You are crying and you want me to leave you alone? You are wrong about anyone. Phone ringing Excuse me. Your father. -Papi, please. Please. -Yes, son. Yes, I'm fine. And you too ? No, but I ... I was pissed off because the machine was down and I couldn't find neither the warranty nor the manual. No, it got better. It's finish. What do you mean, Camille blocked you on Facebook ? That’s Chinese for me. She is doing very well and she works very well. I'm not worried at all. Frankly. Okay, I kiss her for you. She loves that I give her kisses. It's good, goodbye. -Thank you. -My granddaughter, this is a funny number. -Ben, a pure juice Morales. -Yeah. Did you see, I put your drawings there, with granny's photo. -You know, it's horrible, but ... I don't have many memories with grandma. How was she? -It was a beautiful person. Soft music Courageous, loving, generous. A beautiful person. -How did you know her? -In a train. I was coming back from leave. She got on the train with her little suitcase, a little floral dress. It was the embodiment of spring. What is funny, is that I had the wrong train and so did she. Destiny. 6 months later, we were married. -6 months later? -Well ... when you are sure ... And there, beware, for 6 months ... nothing happened. Just love letters. Wasn't Facebook, Google or whatever. We were waiting for the postman. -She died of what? -Of a too long illness. Do you know what she said to me in the end? What was saddest for her, was that she would never see you grow up. Because your grandma loved you. It's like that. So the bac, what are you going to do? -Was... Papi, I'm in front of a mountain. It's in 20 days. I dunno. Find me a good reason to pass it when I can do it next year. -Pride, Camille. Pride to tell you that you have successfully completed a difficult challenge, that you hung on, that you fought and that you succeeded. Know who you are, what. It is not even for the bac that it must be done. It's for you. Just for you. So, what do we check or what? -Ok, you go-y, on check. OK, bam, bam ... Pow ! -It's complicated, your stuff. Do you have Noura's number? -Yes why ? -To find the one who makes Camille cry. -He will know that it's not just candies that make teeth fall. Tire squealing -In fact, it was she who stopped everything. She lied to him for fear of not being up to par. I just know he had to go to Spain. You don't say I told you that. -Do you have a small photo? -Yes. -I will put the colleagues on the spot and we will have news. - I ask again. What are we doing here? -And I tell you again, we're here to get some fresh air. -You criticized us for not being interested in surfing. Here we try, you should be happy. -You take me for an idiot. Yes Yes. -Never in life, Camille. What are you inventing ... André, do we choose? The card looks pretty good to me. -Vegetarian is fine with me. -As it is hot, I take light. I'm going to have a cassoulet with its sausage and its little confit. Here. -Perfect for you. -What is he doing there? -What's the matter ? -No nothing. Nothing. We have to move there. -Camilla, no. We did not order, nobody is moving. -We're fine here, Camille. Let's enjoy it. -Life is Beautiful. The blue sky... -Ah yeah, I got it. Oh yeah... We get out and you're going to pay me. -Camille, you stay seated. You're going to see him, you talk to him in the eyes and you tell him what's on your heart. Your grandfather is telling you. And André agrees. -Absolutely. -Well yeah, that's it. No way ! -What do you mean ? Of course you will go see him. Otherwise we do it for you. Not true ? -But you are eggs! And how did you know he would be there? Papi, did you investigate him? Oh, but I'm hallucinating ... I'm hallucinating . Anyway, I don't care, I like it better. He imitates it. -Are you seen? It looks like a carp looking at a piece of bread. -It's funny... I will not go. -My dear Teddy, our granddaughter is a coward. To imitate the signatures, she is there, but for the rest ... Nothing. -I agree. When you have to be clever, that's fine. But when you have to go to coal ... -You got drunk. -That's the proof. Do you know why she's escaping? Because the best way not to fail is not to face! -Here ! -Like the bac, by the way! -Like the bac, by the way! -Mademoiselle Camille Morales! -Mademoiselle Camille Morales coming down on the beach with a red dress! Not in the sand -hi. -hi. You haven't left? -Well no. I didn't want to leave without saying goodbye. I've been looking for you everywhere since the other night. -Listen, Paco ... How to tell you... In fact, I lied to you. I'm not at Sciences Po. I am 17 years old and I'm having my bac. That's it. I know, it's shame. And then... I said I could surf, but actually ... -I know. I called Sciences Po Bordeaux, no sign of Camille Morales. And then for surfing, worry, I quickly understood. But what then? Where is the problem ? -The problem is that I'm in love with you. But you're not a guy for me. You are ... You're up there. And I'm at the bottom. -Stop it a bit, please. You're the one up there. Look at yourself, you're a ray of sunshine. It feels good to see you. We're going to try something together. If it works, it's great. If it doesn't work, it's life. -OK, we're making a deal. -Well. Are we going to peck? -Yes. * -Hi, change of program. We're not going to Spain. * But hey, we adapt. Right, Pacolito? -Yes. -We are welcomed ... -Paco sleeps in his van. We don't come back to that. And you will say to the two, that at home, we follow the rules. -Yes, we follow the rules. And very strict rules. -It's good, you told me 10 times. -It's better saying it. -10 times. * -Two adorable grandads welcome us, * there is a former captain of gendarmerie, * I appointed Mister André Morales. * is it okay or not? *-Yes. -The second is Teddy, an elder ... -An elder. * -Here, he's an elder. Here. * Hi, Teddy. * -Hello, the community. -What is the story actually? -The story is simple. In the morning, you learn that by heart no more lessons, and in the qfternoon, the annals. -I'm dreaming. You're worse than my grandpa. -Doudou, is it going well for you? Not too tired ? -Yeah, fine. Your house is fresh. -26 degrees, aren't you a little chilly? -No, but "fresh" means "great", "awesome". Like your tie. -Thank you. Paco, I know what he does for studies, but where are you at? -I'm in my 3rd year. -It's good. 3rd year of what? -Sabbatical year. -What does that mean ? -I've been taking my baccalaureate for 3 years, I'm québlo. -Blocked. -Blocked for what? -Every year, the day before the exam, I have hot flashes, cold sweats, chills. I see guys who want to put me in a coffin. I tell myself that this is a sign. -You're afraid to takeit, what. -No, I'm not afraid to take it, I'm afraid to pass it. -To see her ? -Because you need to know what to do next. And I don't know, I want to do too many things. Become a researcher, find a vaccine. Or Wall Street, in a suit with girls. Anyway, as long as I don't know what to do, I don't take my bac. -It's hard for us young people. You have to choose a route when you don't know what to do. Suddenly, it scares us. You understand, right? -I have bad news. The neighbor is dead. Capucine is an orphan. -We will take it here. We are not near a donkey in this house. Forced laughter - Very funny. He's an elegant captain. He took out the jacket. Where is he going like this? -He is going to have dinner with colleagues. -Yes... Colleagues, yes ... He laughs. Lounge music ... -It's okay ? -Yes I'm fine. -You seem a little stressed. -Not at all. -We're taking champagne? -Of course. -A bottle ? -Of course. She sighs. Anyway, I love this place. I find it simple, charming. -Yes. -Did you see the shells? She nods. That's wonderful. She laughs. -It is true. -It looks like it's very good here. The buffet is unlimited. I came to spot before booking to be sure. -It is a very good choice. (And what's more, it's like a hotel.) -Is that so ? ... -Thank you. -And when the hospital calls you at 4am, it is not to wish you your birthday. -Can I ask you a question ? -Of course. -How long has it been since you last had dinner with a woman? -Alone ? -Yes, alone with a woman. -10 years. -Not even an adventure? -Non. - It's a shame, you're still a handsome guy. -Thank you. And you ? -Me, full of adventures. I'm on dating sites and I'm having fun. Tchica Boom, Tchica Boom Tchica boom, tchica boom He clears his throat. I'm fine, I'm kidding. It's just to see your head ... She laughs. Ah, finally a little smile. So what do we do ? Do we dance or take a room? -Ben... Latin music ... -Oh I love ! -Oh, Captain Morales in daddy's box! I can not believe ! Dear madam, delighted. Teddy Bardolino. Nice to meet you. -Viviane Flamand. -Viviane Flamand, it's cute. Tina! You take care of Viviane, please! I'm coming, I'm joining you. Go ahead, little flamingo. It's cute, all that. Ouch ouch ouch. The gendarmerie banquet went well ... Rather well-dressed. -Teddy, please. Be ... Take it easy. And if you could avoid your moments of euphoria: "Monsieur and Madame Thing", you see? -Promised. It touches me that you came to see me. Really. Come on, let's have a drink. Tina! Here we go ! Hop, hop, hop! Tchin. Cheers, girls. At the national gendarmerie and at De Gaulle. -Yes Yes. -So. Viviane, I have a very, very good one. Sir and ... -No, no! No no ! -Yes, André. -But leave it. -Viviane, she wants to laugh. Mr. and Mrs. Acoudre have a son. Mr. and Mrs. Acoudre. André. André Acoudre (word play). -He is funny. Come on, let's dance. -No, I'm watching. -But no, there is no observation. We are not at the museum. We're in a nightclub. Tchica Boom, Tchica Boom ... Viviane is holding him back. Slow music with Latin sounds ... -We are going to dance ! Lively Latin music ... Teddy imitates the cry of the donkey. ... Someone knocked. -National gendarmerie, standing in there. So ! How is my captain this morning? Huh? So say, when you are fat, you are not pretending. I have prepared a small tray for you. -What am I doing here ? -Well, we brought you back. It was better for the little one, in the state you were in. -What state was I in? -Do you not remember? -No, I don't remember. What's happened ? -You didn't want to leave anymore, I had to take your car keys. You called me my colonel and you absolutely wanted me to go to the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier with you. Cherry on the cake, you wanted to take pictures with the bearded woman. Hold. They are pretty, right? Look, it's really you. -And Viviane? -What "Viviane"? -Oh, more Viviane ... You were away for 30 minutes with her, and then you said to me: "I shagged her well in the Cactus, it was a treat." -Not ? -Yes. -I will no longer dare to go to the library. -You will have to. She brought us back and left with the car. -No, she kept the Cactus? -She kept the Cactus. André sighs. -What is all this? -That? My memories, my meetings, my travels. Yeah, you see there? It's June 1980, Corcovado. The meeting with my first wife. And then there. The New York City, Buenos Aires. 2002-2008. Thanks to that, I was able to pay for the house. Every object here, it corresponds to a turning point in my life. Anyway, short. You know what, André? When I come back with my big cats, as you say ... In fact, I don't do much to them. I bring them back to my caravan, I ask them to point out an object to me and I tell them its story. -What's your life, Teddy? -Oh, my life ... It's the circus. The Bardolino circus. I was born here. On this bed, in this caravan. My mother had contractions, my father was performing. Fortunately, there was a doctor in the room. -What was he doing, your father? -Papa... He did a little everything. He was a clown that evening. The first guy who held me , he is a clown. We went from city to city, we traveled all the time. I've never been to school, I haven't had this chance. My brother taught me to read and write. He even forced me to memorize the dictionary. And then one day, the drama. My father dropped him in the middle of a trapeze number. Since then, since... 50 years that I am afraid of falling asleep at night. It's like that. -And shit ... Damn, a brand new car. Throat clearing -Ah, my prince charming. Are you coming for your car? -Yes. -On the other hand, I'm sorry, I made a bad move. It is difficult to drive in reverse. -I saw, it's okay. -Where did I put them? Okay, sit down, because ... Where are you ? I had a wonderful evening. You're a funny number anyway. Do not promise yourself, to you. She continues to laugh. Key rings There you go, Captain Flame. -Thank you. -This gives rise to ... a littoralisation, demographic, urban and port concentration . Bam! -SH. Wesh wesh. -Where does that come from? -It's in the dictionary. -So Google direct. -Go, we go to math. -But you're not funny. -Doudou, you put the cart away. Vegetables in the basket. The cold cuts, 1st floor. Dairy products, below. Come on, hop! -L'unique solution, E2 = A. -Here, hop! The sandwiches for you. I don't want to see you before 8 p.m. I lock up. -But papi! What's wrong or what? -The bac, the bac, the bac, first! -Excuse me. This is ... What is this? She blows. -Yes, mom, it's good. Yes, I took everything. Yes, I have my identity card. Oh there, thank you, it's nice. No, no, don't pass me dad. He will stress me out. Kisses. -Did you see the time? In your place, I would be up since a long time. -No, but I dream. -Do you have everything: eraser, pencil? And the calculator. It is important. -Papi ! It's philosophy. Phi-lo. No need for a calculator. - Come on, it's 7 a.m. We get active. Let's go. Exclamation of opposition -But it's good. The test is at 9 a.m. We're not going to be there 1 hour before. -Your grandfather is right. We don't know what can happen on the road. -Do you have your identity card? -But yes, I have it! -Your calculator? I'm sure you forgot it. -Are you not going to get started too? -André, it is a test of philosophy. -You never know. -I should have gone there in Ciao. -Is that so that you have an accident on the road? -Camille, stop with your stress. Do you see us stressed? No ! So check! -You are in control! She will still not explain to us how we pass the bac! -No, but it's not going! Teddy's anguished sigh -WESH WESH, NOURA. -So ? -sucks, I knew I shouldn't have. -How does it "sucks"? A subject about lying, that should have spoken to you. -That's smart! I stop, it's dead. -No, let's continue. What is next? -English and eco sciences. -What? -English and eco sciences! - Eco science, it's coefficient 7, put everything on it. -But I didn't give a damn about this matter! You understand ? It's dead ! -Hey, talk to me otherwise! Oh ! And what do you say, André? -I say, "As we make our bed, we go to bed." -We're well advanced with that. I have a solution, come on. -Which ? -Viviane. -What, Viviane? -She gets out of the rectorate well? -So what ? -And then ... Viviane ... The rectorship. Laughing satisfied -Ah, I see where you're coming from. No way. In Morales, there is "morality". No no no. -Here I am. And so you happened to happen? -Yes. I was going shopping at the library. -And the little one, the philosophy, how did it go? -A disaster. -Oh no... Ah damn, no ... But then your mission is in danger? -Yes. -It can catch up in eco sciences, it is the biggest coefficient. -Also, she did not do much. - Well then, if it has not worked, it will be very complicated. -That's what I think. Besides, I was not tender. Then I thought about it and uh ... Okay, if it focused on 2-3 important topics, thoroughly ... -Yes, good ... 2 days before the event, this is the only method. -At the same time, these 3 subjects, me ... No matter how hard I think ... Unless... -Unless what? -Unless... How can I tell you that? It's not ... No need for lemongrass? -Not at all. -Because there are some. - Please, captain, tell me. He hesitates. -You have gone through the rectorate? You still have relationships there who could... -I don't understand, you ask me to give you the subjects of the bac? -Not at all. Viviane, c'est immoral, c'est not. More... (a trend...) (-A trend ?) (-Yes, a trend.) -I'll have to convince me, captain. -But yes. He locks the car. Well ... She didn't want to know anything. -Hop, hop, hop! Sit down, captain. Tell. What do you mean "she didn't want to know"? -Well ... What do you want me to tell you? -You caught it like a handle! I knew it, and you took the time! -Yes, but ... -Well, what do we do? We must choose 2 or 3 subjects. -Me, on my side... -You, on your side, Paco, take care of your potatoes. It is a family affair. - Earlier in the car, I thought about it. I have the intuition, is that intuition, not certainty, but I have the intuition that it will revolve around China. Here. Suddenly laughing - "Around China". -Affirmative. -It's a bit sharp, like intuition, right? -Well, it's sharp, but ... it's an intuition around China. Teddy rit. - Around China. Captain, around China, and ... Right around, right? ... -I wonder. Did you get your baccalaureate? -Who ? Us? -Yes, you. -Well... Nasturtium's Braying -Ah OK. I get it. -No, but it was not the same era. -Oh there, ouh there, no. It... This is not the same era. -Fuck... What the hell are they doing? - Go see on the Internet, you will know. -No. I'm too scared. - Sorry, sorry. Sorry, sorry. The little ones, sorry. Sorry, sorry. Is, is, is, is. Klaxon original It's okay ? What are you waiting for? -You think you're funny ? -Well yeah, I'm pretty funny. Tell them, I don't have the courage. -You got it! -We got it? We got it! Cheers We got it! We got it! We got it! We got it! "The More I See You" (Laura Casale) ... -You should have passed it. They give it to everyone. -Oh yeah ? -Go, bravo, girls! To those who have the bac and those who don't. Huh, Dede? They laugh. Horn blows -Who is it? -Will see. -Ah, you are back! -Oh my dear. -It's okay ? -That's why you didn't answer. -We weren't going to miss that! Have you all lived here? -Like a big family. -16 in eco sciences. I can't believe it. -big luck. Huh, André? -The Morales method is good. -Do not take it badly, dear stepson, but it's also the Bardolino method. I was there for logistics, organization ... -I don't know what you did, André, but I find you radiant. Yeah, another man. -Thank you. -Yeah, it must come from library stays . Nasturtium brait. Ah, my daughter calls me. No reason she shouldn't participate. Come on, honey. ... Laughs -Go! ... ... ... Long live the national gendarmerie! ... Thanks for dropping me off, André. I looked on the map, La Baule is near Saint-Nazaire. We will be able to see each other more often, every day. -I will need to rest a little, to recover my marks, we will especially do that. -As you wish. Here, meanwhile, you burned the red light. - You keep talking to me. It's normal. Whistle Oh shit ... -Francis, you check the license. -But I tell you, I passed with orange. -Yes. The car went orange. But the trailer, it went red. What is it, by the way? Horse ? -A donkey. -We're dealing with comedians. -Yes. -You are not improving your situation ... -OK. Well, it gets complicated. Your license is no longer valid. -How do you mean "no longer valid"? -14 speeding on the same radar, the same night, in 10 minutes, a month ago. -If your friend does not have a permit, the vehicle is immobilized. -No, you're not going to block us. We have the road, we have something else to do than wait here. Here is my license, and it's valid. -But what is this permit? -It's a Colombian license. -Colombian? -Yes. -Well, good. We're going to search the whole car. You make the joke and the mule. Especially the mule. Nasturtium brait. Happy music ... ... Groovy music ...
