THE MAGICIAN - Well? - What? - Find what you were digging for? - No, not a thing. You and your mandrake and your severed fingers... and other mischief. - That's right. Spirits used to howl so loudly in this forest that no one dared enter after sundown. I remember it well. You and your spirits! Albert, why do you keep Tubal on as your assistant? You should get rid of him. You hear what your grandmother's telling you? How would Vogler's Magnetic Health Theater manage without Tubal? I ask you. Who bailed us out in Copenhagen at night, and at risk to his own life, after our Danish tour went to hell? I ask, but no one answers. And who brews our potions? You'd have been strung up long ago if people found out what you put in them. "What's good isn't always tasty," Mother always said. In any case, I take the responsibility. And the profits. Careful, Granny. I happen to know something. You hear that? It was a scream. I heard it very clearly. That's a fox. A fox? A fox on two emaciated legs, covered in blood, with its head hanging by a few sinews. A fox with no eyes and a rotten hole for a mouth. I've seen them, and I know what I know. Damned if I'll sit up there with ghosts and ghouls howling around my ears! "Gash in the eye, blood in the mouth, fingers gone, and broken neck. He calls you down, he calls you out, beyond the dead, beyond the living, the living dead, with their upraised hands..." Good day, sir. My name is Johan Spegel. I am very ill, as you can see. Would you alleviate my suffering with a little brandy? For brandy is my infirmity but its remedy too. I am an actor. In fact, a member of the famous Stenborg troupe. But my illness has put an end to my career. Are you an actor too? Then why this disguise? Your beard is fake, and your eyebrows and hair are dyed. Are you a swindler who must conceal his true face? Let us rest a moment... and breathe. Twilight is falling... and this is the last day of life. I've always longed for a knife... a blade to lay bare my entrails... set my brain and heart free... free me from my substance... and cut away my tongue and my manhood. A sharp blade... that would scrape out all uncleanliness. Then the so-called spirit... would rise up from this meaningless carcass. What are you reading, sir? A novel about swindlers. - Colleagues of yours? - There are no swindlers here. No? An interesting book, in any case. "Deception is so prevalent that those who speak the truth are usually branded as the greatest liars." The author presumes there's a great general thing called truth somewhere out there. That theory is pure illusion. So much for your reading, Mr. Aman. Mr. Tubal shouldn't speak with his mouth full. I find this business about truth devilishly interesting. Yes, it's a beautiful passion. If I say one's rump is behind and one's head is on one's neck, that's an absolute truth, and I like such truths. One's rump behind and one's head on one's neck? A rather dubious truth. - I don't follow. It appears to be just the opposite in your case. You're very amusing. Almost a pity you're dying. You'll die too. You just don't believe it. A matter for the future, and the future interests me as little as the past. Can't you see I'm a lily of the field? He's dying. You want to record the precise moment. Observe carefully. I will keep my face open to your curiosity. What am I feeling? Fear... and well-being. Now death has reached my hands... my arms... my feet... my belly. I can't see anymore. I'm dead. You're wondering. I'll tell you. Death is... Most interesting and informative. Ruined financially, wanted by the police, and now a corpse in our carriage. We might have made a better entrance into the capital. Get inside. VOGLER'S MAGNETIC HEALTH THEATER All of you keep quiet. I'll do the talking. I must especially ask Granny to keep her trap shut. And another thing: Granny can make things jump around. Granny knows what I mean. Tables go flying, chairs fall over, lights go out. We all know Granny's tricks. But be good and behave... for all our sakes. I understand... perhaps. God, this old woman makes me nervous. Remember what you did in Ostend? No, I don't believe I do. Granny's tricks are out of date. They're not amusing, as they can't be explained. Granny ought to be dead. Ah, those were merry times in Ostend. I was thrown in the clink, Vogler was fined, and Granny was flogged in the square. Yes, those were merry times in Ostend! Perhaps we should introduce ourselves. Of course. I am Consul Abraham Egerman. Welcome to my house. I, and particularly my wife, have a great interest in spiritual matters, so we asked Police Chief Starbeck to arrange this meeting here. Frans Starbeck, chief of police. I arranged this meeting. I hope my men treated you with all due respect. Vergérus, Royal Medical Adviser. It's only proper that we introduce ourselves as well. First and foremost, our leader, Albert Emanuel Vogler, a big name on the continent. Mr. Vogler has ingeniously developed and perfected the science of animal magnetism. Most pleased to make Mr. Vogler's acquaintance. This is Mr. Vogler's young ward and foremost pupil, Mr. Aman. He's displayed the most remarkable gifts. This venerable old lady is Mr. Vogler's grandmother, once a celebrated opera singer. Who does not recall Countess Agata de Macopazza? I myself count for nothing here. My humble self has found its life's work in serving the great spirit bearing the name Albert Emanuel Vogler. Would Dr. Vogler object to discussing certain general questions concerning his activities? Well then... kindly be seated. Dr. Vogler, in our town's chronicles you advertised a performance promising all manner of thrills. "Sensational marvels never seen before. Magical acts derived from the philosophies of the Orient. Health-giving magnets, and spine-tingling thrills for the senses." Is that your announcement? Sir, these ostentatious formulations, offensive to any educated mind, are not the work of Dr. Vogler's hand. We'd be grateful if the doctor himself would answer the question. Mr. Vogler is deprived of the gift of speech. He is mute, gentlemen. Is Mr. Aman deprived of the gift of speech as well? No. You've said nothing so far. I haven't been addressed, Mr. Chief of Police. So you hold magic séances? - We didn't say that. - Your friend, Mr. Tubal... We use apparatus, mirrors, and projections. It's simple and perfectly harmless. Another question: Does Mr. Vogler heal the sick? We didn't say that. Mr. Vogler recently toured Denmark under another name, posing as a doctor and holding consultations in local inns. "Patients were placed in a dim room and magnetized following Mesmer's principles. This led to spasms and nervous attacks of various types. Some lost consciousness." Why ask if you already know? There seems to be a most remarkable dichotomy in Mr. Vogler's activities. What do you mean? There's the idealistic "Doctor" Vogler, who practices medicine using Mesmer's dubious methods. Then there's the rather less savory Vogler the magician, who performs all sorts of homemade hocus-pocus. If I understand correctly, Vogler's activities fluctuate unscrupulously between these two... extremes. Tell me: Does Mr. Vogler claim supernatural powers? This pointless interrogation is degrading to all parties involved. If we've acted unlawfully... That's precisely what we mean to find out. Forgive me. I didn't know. Come sit down, my dear child. Gentlemen, may I introduce my wife. Mr. Vogler, I'm sorry to say that what we've heard so far hardly inspires confidence. Bring that lamp over here. Hold it right there. Look at me, Mr. Vogler. Why such a furious look? You have no reason to hate me. I only wish to ascertain the truth. That should be your wish as well. Open your mouth. Stick out your tongue. I'm sorry, Mr. Vogler, but I find no reason for your muteness. Your advertisement further states that you can "provoke terrifying visions among your audience." Sir, that's our magic lantern, a silly and harmless toy. I'm not so certain a toy is the issue here. Can you provoke visions? - I protest. - Why, may I ask? Dr. Vogler is a great man and an eminent scientist. You're treating him like a charlatan. It's those around him that make one doubt his scientific merit. Do you provoke visions? - I protest... Silence or I'll ask you to leave! Well, Mr. Vogler? Yes or no? Yes or no? So it's yes. Can you induce this state in anyone? Me, perhaps? Let's conduct an experiment. I'm at your disposal. No, you mustn't. Why not, Mrs. Egerman? Forgive me. No other arrangements needed? No magnets? No mysterious dimmed lights? No strains from a glass harmonica hidden behind the curtains? What would you have me see? Something frightening or exciting? They must be weak vessels. Weak vessels and weak souls. You're straining. Careful. Try no more. You think I hate you. You're wrong. I'm interested in one thing only: your physiology, Mr. Vogler. I'd like to perform an autopsy on you: weigh your brain, open up your heart, study your nervous system... take out your eyes. Stop before it's too late. Too late? Too tedious, you mean. You failed, Mr. Vogler, but you should be grateful for your fiasco. You're harmless. Why are you lying? - I don't understand. - We can see you're lying. Something frightened you terribly, but you don't dare say what it was. Sorry, Mrs. Egerman. I have nothing to hide, no prestige to protect. Who knows? Perhaps I regret the fact I felt nothing. Everything's all right, then? Then you only need my permission to hold your "magnetic entertainment." But sir... Mr. Vogler will perform privately at 10:00 a.m. tomorrow in Mr. Egerman's drawing room. Just as a check. In broad daylight. Any objections, Mr. Tubal? Splendid. - Supper will be served in an hour. - It is a great honor... I'm sorry. Mr. Vogler and company will eat in the kitchen. Mrs. Garp will show you your quarters. Rustan, show our guests to the kitchen. Perhaps we'd prefer to stay in town. The police chief insists that Mr. Vogler and company be our guests. - Quite an amusing game. - What do you mean? Isn't it amusing to humiliate defenseless people? You don't understand. Mr. Vergérus and I made a wager on a question of great scientific interest. - A wager? - That's right. Your husband maintains that intangible, inexplicable forces really do exist. And you deny that possibility? To accept the inexplicable would be a catastrophe for science. A grotesque thought. By all logic we'd be suddenly forced to reckon with... - A god. - If you like. How out of date! Science today is better equipped than ever to penetrate all seeming mysteries. - Seeming? - Everything can be explained. - You're very optimistic. Think of electricity, steam engines. Then our wager stands? We shall see tomorrow. Your wife seems agitated. Is the child's death still... We're going abroad this fall, and I hope... Cheers, gentlemen. To Dr. Vogler and his magnetic troupe. A troupe with an exceptionally troubled conscience! We must be on our guard. They look ghastly. You're too young to understand, Sanna. The magician is mute. He hasn't said a word. Rustan says he's pretending. That's even worse. I'm so frightened. Anyway, they have no money. You need only fear the rich. It's ghastly that they're poor. What if they kill us and steal the master's money? Good evening... little maids. My name is simply Tubal, simple as a folk tune. Let's see now. That's Sara and this is Sanna. Is that so? Now I know. That's Sanna... and this is Sara. - You think so? - We'll find out. In a word, we're invited for supper. Here are the preparations, and here are the guests. Shall we sit down? My lady. Sofia Garp, the cook. I am delighted, flattered, and overwhelmed, not to mention captivated. Delighted. Charmed. Can Mr. Tubal tell fortunes? Mr. Tubal can indeed. Read my palm! My dear child, you're much too young and full of hope. I wouldn't want to stifle your curiosity, your joy in life, your childish faith. One can sense Mr. Tubal's supernatural powers. Yes, indeed. It's a wonderful gift. But heavy and hard to bear, Sofia. Gracious, Mr. Tubal! It makes one hot under the corset, yet cool at the same time. Dear Mr. Tubal, do tell my fortune. That's Antonsson, the coachman. At your service, Antonsson. We've met. Evening. Quiet. He's predicting the future. Quiet, quiet, quiet... I see a light. Now it's been put out. It's dark. I hear sweet words of love. No, I can't repeat them. My sense of decency forbids me. A young man rides at full gallop. It's beautiful. Sara, my child... before you go celebrate your feast of love, take a few drops of our love potion. Your delight will be multiplied sevenfold. It's a gift from Venus Aphrodite. Tubal is but her humble messenger. A love potion! - Is it expensive? - It is costly, for it's well-nigh impossible to procure, and only then under the greatest hardship. And yet you dared! In the name of science... and of love. Might I buy a bottle? Impossible. Your means are far too modest, Sofia. These potions are only affordable for princesses, countesses, and a leading actress or two. But for you, Sofia, because of your beauty, and your great hospitality and courtesy, let's say 13 shillings, or two bottles for 20. It smells so strong! It is the fluidum itself. Passion in material form, to speak scientifically. - Is it good for men too? - Not merely good. Venus Aphrodite touches their hearts with her fingertips and sets the devil loose! Dear God, if Mother was here! We're out of love potion. What now? Take this one, for colic and bunions. What matters is how the bottle looks and how the potion tastes. - You're a fraud, of course. - Of course, Sofia. But you must admit I have a certain something. I was just thinking that myself. You'd make a good preacher. - My faith is shaky. - Perhaps you're right. This calls for a private discussion. I'm going to my room. In a few minutes, go outside, then around to the right. There's a small door there. I'll let you in. You're a real woman, Sofia. Perhaps. My husband died eight years ago. Don't you want your bottles? Keep them. You can sell them again. Marry Sofia? Hallelujah, brothers and sisters. It's a possibility. The main thing isn't faith but power. Sofia felt the power. What can I get for this shilling? A night of love you'll never forget, you big dolt. No, that's rat poison. It won't kill the boy. Drink it in one gulp and enjoy greater bliss than Solomon frolicking with his thousand concubines. Why do you cry, my little ant? Are you a witch? Perhaps I am. I'm so scared of all that's happening, and you're so old and ugly. You'll be ugly too when you're almost 200 years old. - Are you really that old? - Yes, indeed. - Can you cast spells too? - On occasion. But nowadays no one believes in my secrets, so I must be careful. Tubal says you mustn't offend the new faith or you'll end up in a madhouse. How did you become a witch? I can't tell you that. Did you sell your soul? Yes, perhaps I did. Now I'm frightened again. There, there. Go climb into bed, and the witch will bring you a present. Do as I say, little ant. I only want the best for you. Go on now. What are you staring at? When I passed the laundry room, I peered into the darkness there. In the corner hung a body with a rope around its throat. I went closer to see who it was... and I recognized him. I'm not scared of you. It was a murderer hanging from that hook. Yes, that's how it is. One sees what one sees, and one knows what one knows. It just doesn't pay to talk about it. What a life you lead, Mr. Simson. Travel, performances, parties... a life of luxury. And you meet beautiful woman, of course. Women are drawn to magic, Sara. Especially beautiful, hot-blooded women of instinct. Sometimes we even have to fight them off. I remember a Russian princess with green eyes and a lily-white bosom. But let's change the subject. You come to know women. Just one glance, and everything is revealed. And to think I'm sitting here with you. You're cute. - You think so? - And I know what I'm talking about. You have a lovely mouth, beautiful eyes, and a very nice figure. Mother, help me! Why are you shouting? I don't know. I felt a strange feeling. Especially in my tummy. Maybe I'm sick. - It's the love potion. - You think so? What are you doing? Let's each take a swallow, and Venus Aphrodite will come and touch us. She's the goddess of love. Then everything will be bliss. "One does what one does, and one knows what one knows," as Granny says. - I think you're teasing me. - Not at all, my child. I'm preparing a wonderful amusement for us both. And the Russian princess? Is your bosom any less white? No, I don't think so. But her eyes were green. She used to close her eyes. You can do that too. Then let's drink. Now what happens? Now... we just wait. Here? Well, perhaps not right here. I know! Let's go to the laundry room! There are nice, big baskets there full of clean linen. Maybe... we should just wait here. For what? Mr. Vogler might want something. I think he... You've turned so pale. Don't you feel well? I just remembered that this potion can affect people very differently. It can turn some men into raging lions. At times I've almost ripped women apart. How dreadful! But I don't want to harm you. - I won't break. - I see. Anyway, it affects people differently, like I said. It can even make you nauseous. I've heard of people who've died. I think Venus Aphrodite just touched me the right way. Maybe so, but I'm a lot more sensitive. Don't be so afraid, little Simson. I won't eat you up. Look at that. He just trotted off with her. She's usually so standoffish. Drink. You'll feel better. It's so warm in here. Doesn't it smell nice? It's the freshly ironed linen and the apples stored for winter. There's a bird's nest in the window. Well, it's very warm. You're trembling. It's so hot. Then take off your coat. I see Rustan and Antonsson still sitting in the kitchen. And there's a light on in Mr. Aman and Mr. Vogler's room. Sara. Where are you? I can't see you. Here, in the laundry basket, where you said we should be. Well? Of course it would be easy to seduce you. - You think so? - Certainly. But the years make one older and more considerate, you understand? Yes, if I try really hard. One learns not to run around picking every flower by the wayside. You can at least smell them. I just bend over the fragile petals and then move on. Why do you talk so much? I'm afraid of thunder! - Calm down. You have me. That's very reassuring. What is it? - The love potion. Is the effect really strong? I'm sweating like a camel! More thunder! Hold me tight. This knot is so tight. I'll help you. No, don't look. Another button to undo? This is a lot of bother. You don't seem very experienced, dear Simson. Well, I've been abroad most of the time. Hush now. You mustn't be sad, little one. It will soon be your turn. But first Granny has a gift to console you. Is it an ear? Yes. Whisper all your wishes into it and you'll receive what you ask for, but on one condition. - What's that? You must wish for things that live, that are alive or will come to be. I don't understand. No, not right now, but it doesn't matter. Hush now, little one, and I'll sing you a song. The soldier stood with his gun In the howling wind and blinding sun It was war and by the enemy stalked On tired legs the soldier walked The enemy charged from the woods that day Our man stood in the thick of the fray Knives flashed and blood was spilled Many a warrior there was killed The soldier's face with victory was bright Heavy poured the rain that night The soldier sat by himself and wrote To his dearest a lengthy note Love brings solace Love brings rest Love brings strength To the weakest breast Love is one Can ne'er be twain Love is simple Yet hard to explain Did you hear that, little ant? I'm falling asleep. Yes... It's going to thunder. Far, far away. I'm not afraid of thunder. "I call you down, I call you out, beyond the dead, beyond the living, the living dead, with their upraised hands..." That Vogler... People like that should be flogged. There's something peculiar about conjurors. Their faces set you on edge. - Their faces? - That's right. A face like Vogler's makes you furious. You want to bash it in. Vogler's face... There's something peculiar about a face like that. Know what I mean, Antonsson? Someone oughta stomp on it. Faces like that... Vogler's... the old lady's... and Aman's... - A ghost! - Or the devil himself! Where's the brandy? The jug's gone! Is it on the floor? - No. - Where is it? The ghost took the brandy! What are you doing? Getting ready for the performance in the morning. One sees what one sees, and one knows what one knows. I don't like the smell of this. You have only yourselves to blame. I hope they fed you properly in the kitchen. I'll go unpack. Perhaps you wonder why I'm dressed in black. My daughter died this spring. Mr. Vogler... you must forgive them for humiliating you. They hate you because they don't understand you, but I do. Just who are you? I recognized you the moment I saw you. It unnerved me terribly. Forgive me for being so frank, but I so rarely speak. No, I won't cry. We have no time for tears. I've longed for you. My thoughts have been constantly with you. I've lived your life. Yet today's the first time I've laid eyes on you. Perhaps you're silently laughing at me. It doesn't matter. My love is strong enough for both of us. Now I understand why you've come. Feel how my heart is beating. You're here to explain why my child died. What God meant. That's why you've come. To ease my sorrow... and lift the burden off my shoulders. My poor husband doesn't know anything. How could he understand? Isn't it terribly warm tonight? I've felt such anguish. My husband will go to bed in an hour. He's a heavy sleeper, and I put a sleeping potion in his drink. Come to me at 2:00. I'm just across the hall from your room. Let me kiss your hand. No... I want to. Just be still. You hurt yourself. My husband and I have had separate bedrooms since our daughter died. I didn't really die... yet I've already begun haunting people. Actually, I think I make a better ghost than human being. I'm finally... convincing. Something I never was as an actor. A shadow... of a shadow. Don't be concerned for my sake, sir. I've already begun to decompose. I've prayed for just one thing in my life. "Use me. Make me your servant." But God never understood what a strong and devoted slave I was. So I went unused. That's a lie too, by the way. One goes step by step by step by step into the darkness. The movement itself is the only truth. When I thought I was dead... I was tormented by horrible dreams. You look pale around the gills. Seen a ghost? - Just a little tired. - Of course. I bid you good night. My respects to Mrs. Egerman. - Can you find your room? I've been the Egermans' honored guest before. Let's have another drink! Come sit down! When the police chief gives an order, you obey. What a singular magnetic marvel! Dr. Vogler's talents have my greatest esteem. I'm his wife. Then why the disguise? We're wanted. We mustn't be recognized. Why not leave the whole business? Where would I go? I'll tell you a secret. I've struggled all evening with an inexplicable sympathy for you and your husband. - That doesn't sound likely. - I took an immediate liking to you. Your faces, your silence, your natural dignity. I only admit the deplorable fact because I'm tipsy. Then leave us alone. - I can't. - Why not? Because you represent what I despise most of all. The inexplicable. Then you can cease your persecution. Our entire act is a fraud from start to finish. Fraud? Pretense, false promises, double bottoms. A miserable, rotten lie through and through. We're the most pathetic rabble you could find. Does your husband share your opinion? - He doesn't speak. - Is that true? Nothing is true. He has no secret powers? No, perhaps not. I felt nothing but a certain cool excitement. He failed. - It's meaningless. - So I can put my mind at ease? Yes, put your mind at ease. We can demonstrate our incompetence as often as you like. You seem to regret that fact... and wish it were otherwise. But there are no miracles. It's always the props and the patter that must do the work. The clergy's in the same sad boat. God is silent while men babble on. If just once... That's what they all say. "If just once..." For the nonbelievers, but especially for the believers. "If just once..." If just once... It's true. You say you're afraid? Of me too? - Especially of you. That's flattering. One can tolerate your manner and intelligence. Then what frightens you? Your smile. Your kindness. You're probably the only sensible one in the whole troupe. Why continue down this road to disgrace and prison? It hasn't always been this way? No. Perhaps you once believed... that there was some point, that it had some meaning? A long time ago. Why not stop while there's still time? It's no use. - You mean that your husband... - I mean it's no use. There's no way back or sideways. Not for us. Nevertheless, I have a proposition. When you tire of your magnets, you can look me up. I promise to help you one way or another. And my husband? I'm very grateful. I'm just leaving. One last question: Any more masks to come off, or has Dr. Vogler's Magical Theater exhausted its resources? You do me far too great an honor, Doctor. Your wife's faithfulness borders on madness. Go now, for God's sake. You think your husband wants to kill me? Do you want to kill me, Mr. Vogler? You hate me. I like you. Quite stimulating. - Won't you kindly leave. - I shall leave. Good night, madame. Good night, Doctor! Remember in Lyon when we earned lots of money, bought a country house, and intended to stop traveling? Then we sold the property and bought the carriage and horses. That's when you started acting mute. Remember the grand duke in Köten who was so taken by me that he promised to recommend us to His Majesty in Sweden? You thought I'd been unfaithful, and you gave the duke a thrashing. We sat in prison for two months until he forgave us. He was very magnanimous and promised to recommend us to the Swedish court anyway. Do you think he did? No, I don't think so either. I hate them. I hate their faces, their bodies, their movements, their voices. But I get frightened too, and then I lose my power. What if I left you? Go on, if you want. It makes no difference. Albert... Emanuel... Vogler. You came after all. What are you going to do? It wasn't my doing. It was him who seduced me. Are you going to strike me? No, you wouldn't dare. You're a coward. It's bleeding. Forgive me. I'm sorry. No. Don't go. We thank you for your applause and hope you're enjoying our little tricks. And now, for an unprecedented number that's won worldwide acclaim wherein Mr. Vogler's extraordinary powers give even more tangible proof of the diabolical powers behind our world order. Will one of the ladies step forward? A woman of pure heart and beautiful thoughts. Madame Chief of Police? This is the absolute and unprecedented moment of truth. Through the power of these magnets, Mrs. Starbeck will be freed of all pretense, and every word she utters will be the purest truth. Mrs. Starbeck, how much pocket money does your husband give you? I object to this prank! Just a moment, sir. Don't forget this is in the service of science. What year did you marry? I'm not married. How frightful! I'm far too young! - You're not married? - Mr. Starbeck is a carrot. Stop this disgraceful performance! He goes to a whorehouse every Saturday. He eats like a pig and farts at the table. Didn't you hear me? Stop her! He wears a wig. He's smelly and repulsive. Couldn't you at least think of our poor children? I've often wondered how many of them are really Starbeck's, though a few are indeed stupid and ugly. Mr. Starbeck is a pig! I must go home at once. I have a roast in the oven. You stay, dear. You need a little diversion. I didn't say anything silly, did I? These magicians are remarkable. You'll be home for dinner, won't you? I'm not a spiteful woman. You mustn't think that. I can see myself out. Our final number is called the Invisible Chain. Would one of the gentlemen volunteer? The stronger the better. Antonsson. - I'd rather not, sir. - It's an order. Bravo, my good man. Nothing dangerous, nothing harmful. Just breathe calmly. Antonsson is a colossus, but his physical might is nothing compared to Mr. Vogler's spiritual power. Assistant, bind that man in the invisible chains. Your hands are chained together... and your feet are also bound. And the chains are fastened to the wall. After him! The man is dead. No doubt about it. My report will emphasize that Antonsson bears little or no guilt in this matter. Nor can any penalty be expected, as no relative has pressed charges. Should that change, the matter will be carefully investigated, with special attention to any claims against Mr. Vogler in connection with his activities here, claims that could amount to considerable sums. Any objections? If no one finds cause to challenge the aforementioned report, the case will be closed. May I ask what all that means? It means that you can go to hell... if you so please, Mr. Tubal. I thank you for your advice, sir. But what happens to Vogler? Pursuant to the statute re autopsies in private and public institutions, an autopsy will be performed on the said Vogler in accordance with the decision of Medical Adviser Vergérus and myself. Said autopsy will be performed at once at the city's expense and in the service of science. We're very grateful. I thought you would be. Then it's time to carry Mr. Vogler up to the attic, where the autopsy will take place. For scientific reasons, Mr. Vergérus wishes to begin as soon as possible. Like at executions? Perhaps so. We can take him up in that black trunk you're sitting on. Should Mrs. Vogler have difficulty earning a livelihood, I can recommend an excellent house where I enjoy some influence. I appreciate your concern. My wife had some amusing ideas, don't you think? So we carried the coffin up to the attic. The medical adviser and the police chief came in and lifted Vogler's body up onto a big table and started undressing him. What are they actually doing? They cut up the body, pull out the innards, cut off the head, and peek into the brain. Blood gushes everywhere. Just think if he woke up, rose up from under the knife, got off the table, and came downstairs. Just think if he came in and looked at us with bloody eye sockets. There he is! - Don't say that! Don't be afraid, Sanna. I'll protect you. The best thing is to sing a song of trust in the Lord. You're so right, Sofia. What shall we sing? - Having second thoughts? - Second thoughts? I made no promises. You sure seemed eager last night. You trying to embarrass me? Yesterday was yesterday, and today is Sunday. "...and have not found, as a result of the autopsy, any physiological peculiarities or abnormalities, and must therefore characterize the phenomena that occurred in connection with said Vogler as incidental and meaningless, or at any rate of such little importance as to merit no further scientific attention." Is that all? Thank you for your help. I'll send along a copy as soon as it's ready. Are you coming? I'd like your signature on my report. - I'll stop by tomorrow. - Good day, then. Well, what's to become of old Granny now? Fat little pigs shouldn't grunt too loud. They could become bacon. I don't bear grudges, but I do have a good memory, especially for faces. "That was the first time the fly farted without losing its rump"... so my mother used to say. Careful. There are homes and institutions for riff-raff like you. You understand what I mean? - Oh, yes. My regards to your wife, by the way. Would you do me a favor? Please stop the clock. Hear how quiet it is? Yes... it's very quiet. Why did you let it happen? Me? You wanted revenge. I don't know what you're talking about. Vergérus surprised me. I had no say in the matter. You wanted revenge. A strange sort of revenge! Yes... very strange. Revenge! I can't bear it any longer. Manda? Don't turn around. Go and lock the attic door. Don't ask questions. Do as I say. It's hot up here. A momentary nausea. A tool of some kind... Either this is a dream or I'm losing my mind. Since it's inconceivable that I've lost all reason, I'll just wait till I wake up. Very interesting indeed. Leave him alone. You induced a momentary fear of death. Nothing more. Nothing else. - Leave him alone, I say. May I have a little money? We don't have a shilling. We're broke. At least a few coins for our performance. You stare like you've never seen me before, yet we were soul mates. I've never seen you before. I don't know you. I was in disguise. Does that make any difference? Ask your husband. We don't need a lot. Don't touch me! Mr. Vergérus! Will you help me? Convince the police chief to let us leave. I promise we won't come back. I'd like to know just whom I dissected. A poor actor whose greatest wish was to be cut open and scraped clean. So you were never dead... perhaps not even unconscious. Yes, it was a cheap trick. - Are you even sure you're Vogler? - I think so. Not some actor or someone else? Mock me if you like, but help me. You said you'd taken a liking to us. I liked his face more than I like yours. Put on your disguise again so I recognize you. Then perhaps we can discuss your situation. You are ungrateful, sir! Didn't I do everything in my power to allow you to feel something? It was a miserable performance, but of course you should be paid. Take a good look at that man, then tell me if I won our bet. You're right. I lost. Simson, go hitch up the horses. We're leaving. Would you help us pack, Mr. Tubal? I'm staying here. My path leads elsewhere. One should live for the hereafter, as Sofia says. A higher goal, you understand. More meaning and fewer apparatus. No, I'm not going with you. You're looking at my pouches and wondering, aren't you? Go ahead and look. There are 6,000 riksdaler here that Granny collected over the years and buried here and there. Granny's potions. People will pay anything for love. Didn't know that, did you? Good-bye, Albert. I'm off. I've always said you were a foolish and reckless man. One should know one's limitations. Help me down. There goes the rabble. I won't miss them. - Nor will I. - Me neither. - Come along, Tubal. - What? Again, Sofia? But... I'm coming, Sofia. May I please go with you? I don't know what's gotten into me. I must be crazy. It must be that love potion. I can't think the way I told myself to. Go get your things. Hurry now! Thank you so much! Simson, I'm coming with you! - I'll help you! What's taking them so long? We have to get away. If we can just get out of town. Too late... too late. You were lucky, Tubal. Who are you, sir? This is the mesmerizer Albert Emanuel Vogler, whom we thought we autopsied a few hours ago. Mr. Vogler deceived us in his own special way. I can't be sure, but it's probably Mr. Vogler who stands there, wrapped in a blanket. Congratulations. "I have the pleasure to inform you as follows: His Majesty the King has expressed his desire to witness one of Vogler's magnetic performances. I am hereby ordered to conduct the said Vogler to the royal palace so that arrangements may be made for the evening's entertainment. Issued at the Royal Palace, July 14, 1846. Marshal of the Royal Court." I trust you won't mention a word of what's transpired. For your own sake. It's high time you be off, Dr. Vogler. Gather my apparatus and send them to the palace. But be careful. They're very valuable. My darling Simson! Not now, for God's sake! Tonight!
