Hey! And how's our favorite customer? Oh, you say that to everyone. But with you I meant it. We've got fresh madeleines. Yum. Ah-ah-ah, your money's no good here. Amy got an A in history class thanks to your help so free treats all month. Thank you. By the way, how's the job search going? Well, I'm waiting to hear about a teaching job. Until then I'm tutoring and staying at my mother's friend Gabrielle's house. Oh, she's a nice lady. Mmmhmm. Oh, and I'm training her dog, Rose, too. How's your handsome boyfriend? He's still the most handsome gentleman in New York. It's Mr. Wonderful. Donovan wants to meet in the park for a picnic with the pups. Mmmhmm. I will see you tomorrow. Thank you. Love. Come here. Mr. Darcy? Miss Scott. I wish we could stay like this forever. Well, we'd get rained on. Mmm. If it's with you I don't care. Well? Open it. It's a new collar for Bliss. Bliss, look. It's pink. Wow! Love changes people. Loving you has changed me. You make me feel alive. Like everything before you was in black and white and now I can see color for the first time. I want to share my life with you. Elizabeth Scott, will you marry me? Is-is that a yes? Yes. Yes, yes, yes! Yes! May I? Yes. Do you see that, Bliss and Jax? I love it. I love you. Come on! Good thing you live across the street! Ahh! Come on! Oh, Bliss, awe, I'm sorry. Oh, I have to call my mom! Oh honey, I am so happy for you! Me too! Congratulations, Lizzy! You knew? Of course we do. Donovan called us this morning to ask my permission. Is he there? Let-let's see him. She said yes. Yaaa! Congratulations! I'm just so thrilled. I've been waiting so long to plan this with you two. In fact... Surprise! I have ideas. It's gonna be so fun. I'll come out to D.C. this weekend and we can get started. Oh, and I can't wait to see the new shop. I love you, mom. Love you, Jenna. Bye! Love you, bye! Love you! I am so happy that you said yes. Did you ever really doubt it? Are you kidding me? I never know what you're gonna say. It's one of the things that I love about you. You said yes! I told you. It was so obvious you'd say yes. But my big brother was a wreck worrying about it. Was not. A total wreck. It's wonderful. Your mother just called. I'm so happy for you both. That is the fastest call on record. Well, of course she called me. I'm her best friend, after all. And you're basically a niece and now you're a nephew. Congratulations. So, have you picked a date? Not yet. Probably sometime in the fall. We met in the fall. Mmmhmm. So that'll be nice. Yeah. Seven or eight months is not a lot of time but you can do it. We'll have plenty of time, and we're gonna have exactly the wedding that we want. This is a great revision on your essay. Thanks to your help. Hi, Jax, hi. Hi. Hi. Hey. We're just going over Zara's history paper. You know, Amelia Earhart used to be one of my heroes. What made you think of her? Aunt Violet took me to the air and space museum last summer. What did Aunt Violet do? You wouldn't talk to me about it. Well, someone was spreading lies about me and she believed them. She was just protecting your brother. She was trying to embarrass Elizabeth and break us up. Well, now everybody knows the truth and it's time for us to move on. You're sure? I think a wedding is the perfect time to patch things up. I'll talk to her. Ok. Alright, so, if we just condense the ending a little bit, It will structure everything nicely. Violet? Violet. Donovan. Oh, I'm so happy to see you. It's good to see you, too. When you didn't return my phone calls I was worried you were never gonna talk to me again. The thought had crossed my mind. I'm sorry for what I did. I have regretted it every day. You know, you really have Elizabeth to thank for me being here. Family is very important to her. Well, it is for me, too. I've missed you and Zara every single day. I know. I know. You've always been there for me and Zara and for that I am grateful. Oh, you're looking so well. I am. I am. I'm really happy. Maybe it shows. Go on. I've asked Elizabeth to marry me. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. Th... this is sudden. Well, sudden or no, I love her. You just need to get to know her better. I'm sure you'll love her as much as I do. I suppose I have another apology to make. I don't believe it! Aunt Violet just apologized to me. That's a first. And that's Violet taking it back. Hello? Hello, Miss Scott? This is Principal Spraker at the Van Buren Academy. Oh, hello. Listen, I'm calling because we've narrowed down the applicants for our ninth grade history teacher position that starts fall semester. I'd like to interview you personally. Would the 17th at 10:00PM work for you? Yes, yes. I will be there. Thank you. Perfect. We'll see you then. Bye-bye. They wanna interview me for that teaching job. New job? New husband? New life. Yeah. They've updated your CEO bio and you need to approve it. Donovan Darcy is the head of Darcy Enterprises, one of the nation's most innovative private investment firms. That's good. Um, have them include something about my work with the foundation. I never stress that enough. I'll make a note. What's next on the agenda? Uh, me. I'm sorry, who are you? Your best friend? Legal counsel? Incredibly good-looking man of mystery. Ah. I will give you two out of three. You get to pick the two. So I'm not your best friend anymore? That's the one you picked? Cool with it. Whaddya got? I have the final contract for the new rec center for you to sign. Mmm. Riveting. Speaking of, have you seen the new rec center? Nice. Personally I would have made it a little bigger. Well, at the ground breaking in June it probably will be. Ah. Brendan, please start a guest list for the ground breaking ceremony. Make sure my fiancé is at the top and make sure she has a car. Will do. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. You better ask her. Well, of course she's going to go. You can't just assume that Elizabeth is gonna do things. I tried that once or twice with Jenna, didn't go over so well. The Scott sisters should be involved in all of the decision making. Good point. Brendan, I'm going to ask Elizabeth if she would like to go to the ground breaking ceremony and I will let you know what she says. You sure it's alright if Violet joins us for dinner? Of course. She did apologize. Maybe we should wait for her downstairs. She could get here early. No, Violet is never early. She's always exactly 25 minutes late which she says is good form. Besides, I told Linus to send her up when she arrives. Oh! How did you get up here? Hi, Jax. Get up here, big guy. Jax is very smart. Well, not very trainable. No wonder he's the last of Figgy's puppies to go. Aw, you wanna keep him, you know it. In one month from now Jax will be a show dog. There you are, Jax. Aw, come here, baby. There you go. I knew Jax was smart but I didn't know he spoke French. I've been studying. My school's organizing a summer program in Montreal for French immersion. I'll end up trés fluide. Can I go? I'll think about it. That means no. No, that means I'll think about it. Merci, mon frère. That means "thank you, my brother". I know. That means "don't push your luck". Well, while we wait. Ah. Shall we? Yes. Aunt Violet! I'm so happy to see you. Hello, darling. Is she up there? Her name is Elizabeth. And yes, she is. You'll like her. I would have preferred Princess Lucia of Belgium better. Or at least that beautiful little debutant with whom you went to the Governor's Ball, hmm? Well, I'm glad he chose Elizabeth. And you'll be glad, too. ♪ Here comes the sun, ♪ ♪ You chase the thunder ♪ ♪ Here comes the sun, ♪ ♪ You're such a wonder ♪ ♪ You are my true love ♪ ♪ My whole life through love ♪ ♪ There go the raindrops, ♪ ♪ Here comes the sun. ♪ Hello. Oh, hi. Donovan, I've not seen you this happy in years. And you, thank you so much for accepting my apology. Of course. I brought you a gift. Oh, you don't have to do that. I wanted to. Open it. It was Donovan's grandmother's. And now, as Donovan's bride, it's yours. I love it. It's a small token to mark your engagement and to thank you for accepting me back into your life. It's a new beginning. And a wedding is a new beginning, too, isn't it? Yes. I want to help with the planning. Aunt Violet coordinates most of our foundation events. She knows everyone in New York. Oh, thank you. We just want a small, simple wedding. Right? I agree. My mom has a notebook full of ideas but we could use all the help we can get. Anything you want. It would be my pleasure. Mom, what's wrong? Planning your wedding, I couldn't be happier. Mom, there's a lot of time between now and November. Crying is fine but you have to pace yourself. Point taken. Well, to get us started then... Mom! A wedding planner? Thank you. It's to help us organize all the decisions you're gonna be making for your wedding. In fact, what kind of wedding are you picturing? I always dreamed of something small and simple, in a garden with family and friends. Mmm, then that's what we'll work towards. Ok. Would you like to try on a dress or two? We've got plenty of time for that, and I want Zara to be here, she's really excited about the wedding. Ok, well, whenever you're ready. Ok. Because your perfect dress is somewhere right here. Mom. It was nice of you to wait until Zara could be here to try on dresses. I wanted her to be a part of it and- I'm so sorry to barge in unannounced but I have wonderful news. You will not believe it. I had to pull a lot of strings but I managed to book you the Manhattan Grace Church for your wedding. They're usually reserved a year in advance. Well, what do you think? I think it's amazing. Grace Church is gorgeous. Four generations of Darcys have been married there, including Donovan's parents and grandparents. So? I'm in. Let's be the fifth generation of Darcys to get married at Grace Church. Wonderful, I'm so pleased. So which Saturday in November did you get? We would prefer early in the month but we're flexible. No, I told you it was wonderful news, I lied. It's actually a miracle. I got you the church for the third Saturday in June. June? As in a year from now? Uh, we don't wanna wait that long. You don't have to. The church is yours this June. Two months from now. Oh. Um... I say we go for it. Wedding planning in two months, I... You wanted it simple, right? Yeah. I will give you and your mother all the help you need. That's two months. Grace Church. What about a garden wedding? It's not the garden wedding I first thought but Grace Church is beautiful and it's a Darcy tradition. Hmm. Do you realize how large it is? I have done some research and they have small weddings there all the time. Hmm. Mom and Jenna are gonna come this weekend to check out Grace Church and I would love for you to come, too. I would like that. Thank you. Yeah. I love this place. You know, in China red lanterns represent happiness. Do you think they're glowing for us? Without a doubt. So how are things going with the recreation center? Good. Good. I'm really excited about it, actually. I spend most of my day on the business end of Darcy Enterprises but my heart is with the foundation. What good is all that money if it's not doing good for others, right? Why don't you work for the foundation full-time? It's what you're passionate about. I wish I could. I don't think it would be possible, though. Why not? Well, there's always been a Darcy at the head of Darcy Enterprises. Kind of a tradition. Well, there's a tradition of great men running charities, too. Fair enough. For the happy couple. Compliments of the house. Thank you, Evan. That is very thoughtful. So how's Oliver doing? Does he like the daycare I told you about? He loves it. Good. Thank you. Thank you. You are incredible. I have been coming here for years and I never knew he had a son. Oliver isn't his son, Oliver is his dog. I told him about a doggy daycare. He's really cute, too. Wow. I always loved these windows. It's magnificent. Someone once said, in 1860, to be married or buried within these walls was ever considered the height of felicity. I vote for married. What do you think, mom? Can we make this work for an intimate wedding? Well, I think that with flowers and candles to define a smaller space, it'll look magical. Have you thought about a theme for the wedding? Yes, because the church is very formal so it's all in the details. What about city garden? We can get all kinds of different types of flowers in all sorts of colors. Like they're blooming right here in Manhattan. I love it. Great. Perfect. And they say wedding planning is hard. Hmm. Gorgeous. Just stunning. I like the garden wedding theme, too. So what's next to be decided? The guest list. Tea and coffee for the most wonderful couple in New York. Awe. Thank you. Thank you. I'm meeting with Aunt Violet tomorrow and we're talk about it. Do you remember the first time that we ate macarons? Of course I remember. We had them for the first time when I took you to see the painting of Queen Victoria and her dog and you thought I was pompous. And you thought I was rude. No, I thought you were smart, challenging, and completely charming. And exactly the woman for me. How convenient, because I knew you were exactly the man for me. Ok, so... guest list, check. Thank you for having me. That's a beautiful tea set. It's a family heirloom. Donovan's great-great-grandmother received it as a wedding gift. Oh. I know that you and Donovan want to have a very simple wedding and I've been working on the guest list on the Darcy side and I've trimmed it down as much as possible. The final figure I've come up with is 400. 400. Are you inviting everyone Donovan has ever met? Heavens, no. The first version was almost 600 people, and there's simply nobody else we can cut. As it is, the French second cousins will never forgive us. All right. Hey. Branden said I could just come in. Of course. How was tea with Aunt Violet? It was eye-opening. When we talked about a simple wedding what were you picturing? I don't know, a simple wedding? Maybe 250 guests. Obviously I would take care of all the expense. Why? What were you picturing when we talked about a simple wedding? I was thinking like 30 people. Oh. Close friends, family, our loved ones, and the dogs, too. You remember I was young when mother and father passed and I took over the business and a lot of people took care of me along the way. A wedding invitation is a way to thank them. And I have to invite the foundation donors, they're nearly family. Wow. 30 people, 250 people, that's quite the range of simple. Yes, it is. Well, I mean, how do you feel about 250? Let the wedding guest auction begin. The high estimate is 250 but the lady's opening bid is 30. Going once, going twice- Ah, but the appraiser says that this will be the finest guest list in all of New York. After contemplating the fine guest list the lady's next bid is 75. Hmm. So this reserve is 150. She hesitates, she wasn't planning on going higher but finally she doubles her bid to 150. Ah, opening bid is 150. Going once, going twice, sold to the lady with the beautiful blue eyes. 150 guests. And you have to tell Aunt Violet. I would love to work here. Well, thank you, Miss Scott. Your credentials and references are good, but I'll be honest with you. We are seeing a number of other well-qualified candidates. I understand. So you're going to D.C. to pick out wedding dresses tomorrow? Yep. I'm flying in tomorrow, Zara's gonna be there, so is Aunt Violet. It was nice of you to invite them. I invited Zara. Aunt Violet invited herself. Don't let Aunt Violet complicate things. You just pick the one you want. Says the man who already owns the tuxedo he's going to wear. What's that? I'll show you. Oh. Hey. Well, I knew that you were having a stressful day so I wanted to cook you dinner. Awe. Oooh. Huh? Mmm. That smells amazing. I like to surprise you every now and then. Awe. Well, cheers to that. Cheers. Hello? Hey! Hey. It looks so great in here. Hi. Hi. Hello, Linda. Finally we meet. I've heard so much about you. I've heard a lot about you, too. Welcome to D.C. Thank you. And you. I have waited to choose your wedding dress for as long as you've been alive. Well, there's nowhere else I'd rather get it. Well, ladies, let's get to work. We don't have a lot of time, only eight weeks. I've already gone ahead and picked out some dresses that I thought might work. The first one has a classic, elegant, Grace Kelly kind of feel. It's beautiful. But it's not me. Not a problem. Alright, and the next one... voila. I'm not really a lace kind of girl. Ok. This last one, I don't know why, but as soon as I saw it I thought of you. Wow. I'm gonna try that on. This is the dress. You look amazing. Who's the designer? Sunlight Bridal. They're one of the best. An off-the-rack gown simply won't do. This is going to be the most photographed dress of the season. Well, this is exactly what I want. I have a suggestion. I know the designer Mariana Merel. Wait, what? You know Mariana Merel? Mmmhmm. Who's that? One of the most famous gown designers in the entire country. Mariana did my sweet 16 dress and I loved it. Mariana is truly gifted and we want you to be the most beautiful bride of the season. Lizzy, the dress you're wearing is beautiful. I know. So why do I need a designer label? Well, she's not just a designer label, honey. She does exquisite designs. They're works of art. You have an appointment Friday at 10:00. Oh! Given the tight schedule her staff is sending over the preliminary questionnaire. But I... Lizzy, sweetheart. You at least owe it to yourself to meet with her. I'll put the dress you're wearing aside and if you decide you still wanna wear it, it'll be here for you. Let me take off the dress and we can talk. I'll help you change. Thanks. Oh... thank you. Thank you. Oh... You are the bride, you get to choose the dress you want. If you want this one, wear it. I would have been happy wearing that dress but maybe it's not right for Grace Church. And there are gonna be a lot of eyes on me. Can you imagine 150 Aunt Violets at my wedding? "This off-the-rack dress simply won't do". Oh, heavens, no. I'll take the meeting with Mariana Merel but I get the final choice. I want a dress that I love. The decision is all yours. Good. Hi. Hey. Did I forget about a date? Uh, no. I did. There's a foundation meeting tonight and I forgot to tell you about it. Oh. That's ok, I'll just see you tomorrow. Yes, but you don't understand. You are now a member of the board. I am? It only meets once a quarter. And they expect me to meet tonight. Yeah. Donovan, the foundation is a big deal. You didn't even ask me- I realize it's short notice, but I thought you'd wanna be a member of the board. Well, I do. Come on. Hi, guys. Hi. Elizabeth? You alright? I'm just changing. You look lovely. I've been travelling all day. I don't look lovely. Well, did you pick a wedding dress? Not yet. Your Aunt Violet set up a meeting with Mariana Merel. Mariana's good. So she gets your vote for the dress? If you're happy, I'm happy. My fiancé, the quick change artist. Donovan, I'm happy that I'm being invited on the foundation board but next time can we discuss things like this first? Yes, I hear you. Ok. Well, let's go. So now I'd like to welcome our newest member, Elizabeth Scott, soon to be Mrs. Darcy. Elizabeth, everyone here is curious, what will your areas of interest be with the foundation? Um... it's an honor to be asked to be a member of the board and I'm excited to be here. Uh, I'm a teacher so I'm just gonna pretend you're all ninth graders and it's my first day of school. I- I don't know what my area of interests are but I do know that I am planning to go back to teaching once we're married. Um... but I'd love to work on educational projects. But uh, I'll keep you posted. To finish this off I'd like to say that I- I can't wait to get to know you all. Well, I knew you'd do well but you did great. Really? I was totally faking it in there. I thought you did amazing. Donovan, you have to realize that this is all new to me. You can't just throw me in the water and expect me to swim. I'm sorry. Next time I'll try and keep you on dry land. Good. You know, the foundation is so wonderful. I could see in the meeting how much you love it here. I give my days and my time to the company but my heart belongs to the foundation. I know you said there's always been a Darcy at the head of Darcy Enterprises but that can change. It won't be easy, but... Life is short. You should follow your heart. Donovan. I'm glad I caught you. I need one more signature for the Albany deal. At least for now my heart will have to take second place. This should just take a moment. Of course. I'll just wait for you here. Elizabeth? May I give you a word of advice? Of course. I don't know that you understand how important our board members are. They are some of the most powerful people in New York and you called them ninth graders. I was a little taken aback, and I'm certain Randolph Pack was. I'm sorry, that's not at all what I was trying to do. Yeah, I'm sure that you didn't know that you were offending them. And while we're speaking, I was surprised to hear that you've decided to return to teaching. Yes, I am. You're not going to have time for that. Not with your new social obligations and your board duties. You certainly don't need a job. Oh, well, teaching isn't a job, it's who I am. It's who you were. Now you will be Mrs. Donovan Darcy. That's a very important full-time position. Elizabeth? Is something the matter? Donovan, you know I'm gonna go back to teaching after we're married, right? Of course. Why? I just talked to Violet. She said I wouldn't have time to go back to teaching after we're married. I fell in love with a teacher and a teacher is who I'm gonna marry. I'll talk to her, ok? Ok. There is no need for Elizabeth to have a job. Elizabeth wants to teach after we're married and so she will teach. I have learned that sometimes you can't always have it all. I know how much you had to give up for us when mother and father died. You were living in London, right? Paris. But I was happy to come back and take care of you and Zara. All I wanted was to keep you two safe. You have no idea. The responsibility sometimes terrified me. But you two are the lights of my life. It's not up to me whether Elizabeth continues to teach. If that's the way you both want it then I suppose that's the way it's going to be. I appreciate that. Oh, aren't you just so handsome? They are gonna love you. Now, remember, you are a show dog. The entire world will be watching your every move. They will be judging you at all times. But you can do this. I can do this. Mom! What are you doing here? Surprise! You didn't think I was gonna miss your appointment with Mariana Merel? And... I'm here, too! What? And guess what? I am not leaving until we get you married. And I'm gonna be here for as long as you want me. And I am just their chauffeur so don't mind me. Aw, you're not just the chauffeur. No? You're also my handsome boyfriend. I got her wrapped around my finger. Oh yeah. Mmmhmm. Uh, and now, handsome boyfriend... Hmm? Would you please go to the car and get the bags? Thank you. I'm so happy you're here. Awe. Hey, bud. He's being a very good boy. Awe. I've gone through the questionnaire you filled out, and since there's only five weeks until your wedding I've already drawn up two preliminary sketches. You said you like simple lines. This first dress is sleek, elegant, classic. That is beautiful. That's exactly what I want. So beautiful. It's lovely. Very nice. The second sketch goes in a slightly different direction. Your wedding will be the wedding of the season. This first dress is beautiful but subtle. This dress will make you look truly magnificent. I have to be honest. It's simply stunning. Oh, Elizabeth, you are going to be the most magnificent bride in New York City. It's amazing, but Lizzy, is it you? It's your choice. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm not going to be any help at all. I love them both. Thanks a lot, mom. Uh, well, if I was getting married in a garden it would have been this one. But I'm getting married in Grace Church. So Mariana, this is the dress. Ah, excellent choice. How did the meeting with Mariana Merel go? Aunt Violet thinks I'll be the most magnificent bride in New York. And I'm sure she's right. Donovan, what if I can't be magnificent? What do you mean? When we're together it feels like everything is fine. But when we're apart there are all these expectations. Do you ever feel like you and I are just... so different? Well, we are different. That's-that's what I love about you. Are you worried? I guess I-I am. I think. It's just all the wedding planning is starting to feel a little bit overwhelming and the word "magnificent" is a little bit hard to live up to. Well, I'm sure that you will be the most magnificent bride in New York. Is there anything I can do? Well, there is a cake tasting. I will be there. I promise. We haven't even talked about our honeymoon. Where do you wanna go? Mmm, somewhere warm. I just wanna spend some time with you. You shall. Good job. See? He is doing much better. More focused, less distracted. Sit. Nope, not distracted at all. Good morning, Violet. Please come in. Hello, Linus. Oh, you're both here. Wonderful. Oh, Zara, darling. I have something very serious to discuss with you. Now, I realize that the wedding is in four and a half weeks and the invitations are going out in a couple of days and I've been struggling. With the addition of Elizabeth's family and friends I can't get this guest list below 200. But we agreed on 150. Come on, Jax. Let's go for a long, long walk. Elizabeth's right, we agreed on 150 and that's what it needs to be. I honestly don't see how we can cut this down any more. There would have to be some people we could cut. Elizabeth... Elizabeth, I'm sorry. These-these are all important people. I don't think I can cut any of them. I guess there's nothing wrong with having too many friends. Looks like we'll have to go with 200 guests. But with 200 we're gonna need a big reception space. It's a Darcy tradition to use the ballroom at the Greenmore Hotel. I reserved it several weeks ago just in case. You reserved it without consulting with us? It's just an option, honey. Did you have another venue in mind? Well, no. Then everything will work out splendidly. I know the wedding is expanding and obviously with such a short schedule certain things might be overlooked so I've given it a little thought and, uh, these are some of the things that remain to be done and I would help coordinate with you and your mother. Please, allow me to help give you a wedding you'll never forget. Well, what do you think? Sorry I'm late. What, do you think you're the boss or something? Something like that. I have decided to take a month off. What do I need to do to accomplish that? Oh, not much. Maybe clone a twin. Mmm. What's up? The wedding. The wedding's what's up. There's gonna be a couple hundred people everywhere, Elizabeth wants a small wedding so I want the honeymoon to be about Elizabeth and I. I want to give her the trip of a lifetime. I want to take her to see all these historical places. I know she's always wanted to see, and not for a week, for a month. Well, sounds fantastic. I'm sure she'll love the idea. See what she says. And I want to surprise her. Surprise her? When exactly are you planning on telling her? The reception. Really? Well, it'll be a surprise. I mean, you do know what a surprise is, right? Yes, because I hate them. Ah, well Elizabeth does not hate them. You should have seen her face when I surprised her with the ring. This is gonna be like that but times ten. I just have to work more, a lot more, before the wedding. Hmm. Thank you, Mrs. Darcy, for inviting me to your home today. The cake you made for the Vanlier wedding was sublime. I usually do a group tasting at my bakery but Mrs. Darcy explained with your tight schedule it would be more convenient if I brought the tasting to you, so voila. Excuse me. Hey, Donovan, are you almost here? I'm sorry, darling. I thought I left the office with plenty of time but the car hasn't even moved in 20 minutes. I'm not gonna make it. Is it alright if I give you my proxy for the cake? Well, we can wait for you. I'm not even close. Really. You should do the cake tasting without me. I'm really sorry. Um, ok. I love you. I'm sorry. Donovan won't be joining us after all. Not a problem. Let's begin. Warm up your taste buds, ladies. On your left there's our award-winning almond truffle raspberry fusion cake. There are so many words to like in that sentence. Wow. Mmmhmm. Mmm. Next we have dark chocolate with real gold leaf. Well, chocolate isn't traditional and the gold leaf is a bit gauche. Understood. Next we have vanilla buttercream with a white ganache drizzle. Double wow. No, double double wow. Mmm. Mmm. Lizzy? Wow. Mmmhmm. Donovan, what're you doing here? This is our spot. That's why I proposed here. So, what've you been doing all afternoon? Thinking. Just a little stressed out. I'm sorry, I know this wedding is expanding and I know that Aunt Violet is never short on opinions. She means well and I want her to like me. She knows a lot more about these kinds of weddings than I do. I've never been to a wedding like this let alone planned one. You're doing just fine. I'm just starting to feel a little bit overwhelmed, but this is supposed to be fun and I know it's just cake but I was really looking forward to picking it out with you. Elizabeth, I don't want you to think that this wedding isn't important to me, too. It is. It's my way of showing the world how much you mean to me. You mean the world to me, too. We'll work through this. So what kind of cake did you choose? Well, you weren't there so you're gonna have to wait 'til the wedding to find out. Oh, come on. Tell me. Please? Alright. I picked a vanilla buttercream with a white ganache drizzle. That does sound pretty good. It was really good. These invitations look beautiful. They better. They just went out to 200 guests. If that's Violet adding more guests don't answer. Hello? Principal Spraker. I would love to come for another meeting. I will be there tomorrow. Thank you. Another meeting is good, right? Obviously you didn't do as bad as you thought. He didn't say what it was for. Oh, stop it. You're gonna get that job. What do you think, Bliss? Hmm? What do you think? After interviewing all the candidates I'd like to offer you the job. You would? I love the story about the student who inspired you. You did? Everyone else talked about how they changed their students. You explained how a student changed you. Can you start August 26th? Yes. Thank you. Thank you. Yes. Donovan Darcy's office. Hi Brendan, can I speak to Donovan, please? Hi, Elizabeth. Let me check. Donovan? And that's the honeymoon suite, correct? I want a view of all of Rome. Sorry, he's not available. Ok, um, well, I'll just talk to him later. Thanks. I am so happy to be here today to discuss your wedding flowers. These cymbidiums would make an elegant display, especially massed. They're lovely, but I've seen them three times at a wedding this year. They've been done. Ok. Uh, what else can you suggest? Well, these white lilacs are exquisite. June is a little late in the season for them but I do have a wonderful distributor in Provence who can guarantee a delivery. I must warn you, though, they are quite expensive. Well, Elizabeth deserves the best. White lilacs get my vote. Are you sure you can get them here on time? The wedding's in three weeks. Of course. Not a problem. Wait. The theme is "city garden". I was hoping to have a little bit more color. I wanted to discuss that with you. It's a very formal wedding and I think colored flowers are so... informal. But it's what Elizabeth wants. Of course. It was just a thought. Lilacs are beautiful but I like buttercups better. Oh, honey, that's so sweet. Buttercups? Really? Am I missing something? My dad and I used to pick yellow buttercups on summer vacation every year. If we had them at the wedding it would feel like he was with me. I love that idea. I do, too. Well, we could put buttercups in your bouquet. I have a compromise. Buttercups in your bouquet and white lilacs throughout the church and at the reception. Or we could have white lilacs and buttercups together at the church. The hotel provides a selection of everything needed for the reception. All we have to do is choose. Oh my goodness. This seems appropriate. Ooh, I think that this looks better. I think we'll do the simple ones. So we're done, right? Uh, no. Now we need the stemware, the silverware, the linens, the chairs. You forgot the dance floor. Dance with me? Ok. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ I'm-I'm sorry, darling. I have to take this. Ok. Hello? I know you're with Elizabeth and can't talk but the Louvre might approve an after-hours visit for your honeymoon. The director must speak to you right away. I understand. Elizabeth, I need to go and speak with Brendan. It might take a while. You carry on here without me? Ok. Elizabeth. Before we move on to other choices, I'd like to revisit this china. Aunt Violet, believe me. I appreciate you helping us with the wedding but I don't need you to second guess me every step of the way. That wasn't my- I want those napkins, that stemware, this silverware, these candle sticks, and those chairs. I think we're finished here. Well done. Hey, Zara. What's wrong? Remember how I wanted to go to Montreal in August to study French? Mmmhmm. Donovan says I'm too young. I'm 17. I think he's just being protective. Overprotective. I know that's how it feels for you, but he loves you and he just wants you to be safe. Do you want me to talk to him? Would you? As soon as he gets here. Oh, hi, buddy. Are you the cutest? Are you the cutest? Oh. Thanks, Linus. I'm sure Mr. Darcy will be here soon. Hello? Hey. Hey, it's me. Look, I'm-I'm really swamped here. So I'm not going to see you tonight? I know, I'm so sorry. I know we were supposed to go out tonight to celebrate your new teaching job. I just have so much to do here and I haven't even started on the prep for the ground breaking tomorrow. Will you forgive me? Of course. I understand. I just miss you. I miss you, too. I'll see you tomorrow at the ground breaking. I love you. I love you. At least you like spending time with me. Do you want to come with me to the ground breaking tomorrow? I'll bring you. A puppy always makes everything better. On behalf of the Darcy Foundation I'd like to thank you all for coming out in this fine weather we've got and welcome you to the future site of our first after-school recreation center of Westchester County. When the center is completed it will provide the young people of this community with activities and programs that will enrich their lives. I thank you for joining us and I look forward to welcoming you back to the completed building. Kids, what do you think? Smile? Oh, you can do better than that. Let me introduce you to Elizabeth and Jax the wonder dog. I know he may not look like a wonder dog but he is. His superpower is that he makes everybody smile. Wanna see how it works? ♪ Row, row, row your boat, ♪ ♪ Gently down the stream, ♪ ♪ Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, ♪ ♪ Life is but a dream ♪ Look good? Alright. Thanks, guys. Hey. See? Jax is just what we needed. He's a sweetie, but I'm thinking of giving up on his, uh, dog show training. Can't force him to be something he's not. Plenty of show dogs in the family, he can just be a love dog and a singer. The foundation is doing so much good. I can see how happy you are here today. It makes me almost as happy as you do. Are you sure you can't do this full-time? Do what full-time? Oh, uh, the Darcy Foundation. I've been encouraging Donovan to take a step back from Darcy Enterprises to spend some more time with the charity. But there's always been a Darcy at Darcy Enterprises. Well, I think it's time that things change. You're not seriously considering this. You are needed. Henry knows almost as much about running the business as I do. So you have been considering this? You can't consider this. The good of the company is at stake. Well, I think this is about Donovan's own good. He spends his days and his time with the company but his heart is in the foundation. Violet, the decision isn't about you or me, it's about how Donovan is gonna spend the rest of his life and I'm gonna support him no matter what and I hope that you can, too. This isn't something that needs to be decided today, but it is something that I'm considering after the wedding. There'll be plenty of time to discuss it. Hello there, Jax. And hello, Miss Scott. We were very impressed with you in the boardroom. You were? I'm sorry I referred to you as ninth graders. My wife laughed when I told her what you said. I want to show you my rescue dog, Linnet. Awe. Yeah, I would love to have Jax over for a play date, after the wedding of course. That's in a week, isn't it? Six days. We would love to. Great. Right, Jax? Well, that went well. It did, didn't it? Wanna grab some lunch? I wish I could but I really have to get back to work. Do you really have to? We keep missing each other and I promised Zara that I would talk to you. Zara? It's about the Montreal program. She's really disappointed that you won't let her go and it's a really great opportunity for her. It won't hurt her to stay here one more summer. Besides, she's too young. She's 17. I went to a great history program in Boston when I was her age. You know, she's also not as grown up as she thinks she is. She is more grown up than you think she is. You need to encourage her to pursue her interests, not stop her. You need to take her feelings into account. Elizabeth, I really think I'm right about this. Let her stay here in town one more summer where you and I, and Aunt Violet, can look after her. I really do have to get back to work. I know I've been working a lot lately, but I promise it won't always be this way. Hey. Hey. Are you alright? Did something happen at the ground breaking? It went fine. Then what's wrong? I'm worried that Donovan might be pulling away. You know that's not true. I don't know. We used to spend so much time together. We'd walk the dogs, make dinner, dance... now I never see him. I'm afraid he's more interested in spending time at work than with me. Henry says he's super busy. Lizzy, Donovan adores you. What do you think, Bliss? Hmm? This is my favorite moment: when we see the bride in the finished dress. Oh, oh, Lizzy! Oh... Splendid. It's even more than I hoped. Wow. What do you think, Lizzy? It's something out of a dream. You look like a princess. Then why don't I feel like one? Oh, thank you. It's worth every penny. And I don't look anything like me. Elizabeth? Is everything ok? No. Can we talk? Of course. This wedding is starting to feel wrong. The guest list is huge, my dress is way too much and they're are all these expectations and I- Ok, ok. Just talk to me. Why can't we just be two ordinary people who are in love? That's what we are. We're two people with 200 guests at our wedding. Ok, so-so what're you saying? We can elope. We can get into a car and go to a justice of the peace and that way it's just about us. Just two people who are in love and getting married. No big church, no fancy dress, no fuss. We could do that. If you want. Do you want a-a small ceremony with none of our friends and none of our family? I don't know. I'm so sorry but they're getting restless in the conference room. I'll be there when I can. Look, I... I love you more than anything. Why don't you go back to your meeting and we can continue this conversation tonight? I love you. I do want to talk about this. I'll find you at Gabrielle's later, ok? Ok. Donovan? Hey. Henry just dropped me off. What're you still doing up at 2:00AM? I was waiting for Donovan. He just texted me. "Held up at work. Now it's too late." "Sorry. See you tomorrow." I thought I was marrying Donovan Darcy, not his work. Is it always gonna be "see you tomorrow"? I'm sorry. Elizabeth. I need to talk to you. Please, come in. Come and sit down? No. This won't take long. I've been up all night thinking... and I do love you and I know that you love me. Of course I love you. And in three days we're supposed to get married but... What? My heart is telling me that we might be rushing into this. So what're you saying? I don't know. I'm so confused. So sit and talk to me. I don't wanna sit! I'm sorry but I need time to myself to think. Elizabeth, wait. Elizabeth! Elizabeth, come on. I need to talk to you. Please? Elizabeth, I really need to talk to you. Elizabeth, come on. Please? Elizabeth, please talk to me. Elizabeth? Lizzy? What's going on? I told Donovan that I need some time to think about the wedding. The wedding is almost here. Elizabeth. Are you serious? Elizabeth, open the door. Please. Yeah. What's going on? Elizabeth says she's not sure about the wedding. Is she calling it off? I don't know. She came over, she said that we're drifting apart and that she thinks we're rushing into things. You've got to talk to her. I tried. She won't see me. Lizzy? I just want to be left alone. Ok. I'll just leave it here for you. Did you see this coming? No. No? Really? There was nothing? Uh, well, she was talking about how he was always at work and, oh, she was worried he was pulling away, but I didn't think she was this upset. Ok. He has been working day and night, but he's been doing it for her. He's been doing what for her? Well, it was supposed to be a surprise but he has been secretly planning a month-long honeymoon. Ok. That's really sweet. Completely misguided, but sweet. We have to tell her. No, no, no, no, no. This has to come from Donny. Henry! When we get married, no surprises. Yeah. Way ahead of ya. You've gotta do something. She will not talk to me. So try again. Buddy, she needs to know why you've been absent. What if it's too late? Donovan, how are you? I don't know. I don't know how I am. I- I... I'm always so sure of myself and now I'm not. Elizabeth has a good head on her shoulders. She'll come to her senses. What if she doesn't? Come in. Elizabeth, May I come in? I just saw Donovan. He's devastated. I'm sorry if I hurt him. I'm sorry if I've caused you any pain. It was from my manner and not from my heart. I appreciate that. I know I may have been a little pushy and overbearing regarding the wedding, but Donovan's like a son to me. I want what's best for him. You see him as a confident, successful businessman. I suppose I still see him as a heartbroken 19-year-old who just lost his parents. When I first met you I was worried that you weren't strong enough for him, but when you stood up to me about him running the foundation full-time I was impressed. You seemed annoyed. Well, I was at the time. I know you have his best interests at heart, as do I. You two will make a wonderful team. Thank you, Violet. That really means a lot to me. Lizzy? Hey. You're my beautiful, brave, headstrong, impulsive daughter. And if you decide you don't wanna get married I'll support that. But I wanna ask you a question. Do you really think you can live the rest of your life without him? "Dearest Elizabeth, I'll be at our spot in the park." "I'm asking from the bottom of my heart," "please come talk to me." So... what're you gonna do? Aunt Violet says that we are the two most stubborn people on the planet. And this is what I was being stubborn about, even though Henry told me I'm wrong. Remember when I surprised you with the ring? I wanted to surprise you with one more thing. I've been working night and day to give us a one month around the world honeymoon. I probably should have included you in that decision. That's why you were never there. I wish you would have told me. I should have. I was wrong. I love you so much. But we're just so different. Our weddings show how different we are. I... I wanted a tiny garden wedding. You wanted a wedding for 200 people. And neither of us is wrong for wanting those things. I'm just afraid that's what our life is gonna be like. That one of us is gonna have to give up what we want. Can't we have it all? I don't see how. I think our differences make us stronger. I think we're better together than we are apart. You made me see the world differently, about a lot of things. Even the foundation. Henry and Randolph Peck can run the business side of things and I've decided I'll spend all of my time with the Darcy Foundation. I'm glad. You know, for a while there we stopped communicating and that's where our problems started. Because we're always at our best when we're talking all the time and I love that. I never told you how important the garden wedding was for me. I just wanted it to be us and a few people that we love and I lost that. And I just wanted the big wedding so we could be surrounded by all the people who wish us well. And now we're back to where we started. I have an idea. I do, too. Mmm? What are you thinking? You first. No, you first. You first. I asked first. Ladies first. Hmm. We got a text from Donovan. We received one from Elizabeth. If they're breaking up I'll be crushed. Devastated. There they are. So what have you decided? I've got to know. I have decided that maybe you are a bit more grown up than I've given you credit for, and you can go to the Montreal camp this summer. You should be able to pursue your interests. A smart teacher told me that. She was right. That's great. But what about the wedding? Oh, right. The wedding. Well, Donovan and I decided what we wanna do and the only way we can make it happen is if everybody helps. We're all family now. We need to work together. Mmmhmm.

Because you've exchanged vows before God and these witnesses, and pledge your commitment each to the other, and declared the same by joining hands and exchanging rings, I now pronounce you husband and wife. You may now kiss the bride. Ladies and gentlemen, I am happy to introduce Mr. and Mrs. Donovan Darcy. I love you, Mrs. Darcy. I'll hold your hand today and forever. And I will never let you go.
