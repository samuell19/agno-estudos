You forgot to say 'Bismillah'. Classmates, today we will learn about energy Energy is represented by the letter E. The unit of measurement of energy is the Joule. Named after the British scientist James Joule. For physicists, energy is the capacity of a system to produce work. The different forms of energy are the following: Kinetic energy electrical energy and heat. In everyday life, energy is equivalent to money We all need energy We get it from the food vve eat. What do vve need to buy food'? Money We use money to buy food. That's how we obtain energy Money food, energy These three things constitute our life cycle. Lock your hands together. Follow the hammer. Tongue out. Show me your teeth. Arms out wide. Touch your nose with your index finger. Other hand. Open your eyes. - Do you sleep well? - Yes. You need a comprehensive examination. Take the lid off. Asian - Here for the medical exam'? - Yes. Give me your hand. No, the other hand. Wait there. Hello - laboratory here. Ever had an unwanted erection? Gotta out that out. Have you seen the fat doctor'? He's got a metal ruler. If you get an erection he'll smack you so hard. Your little fella will go floppy so quick. If you still have an erection, he'll hit you again. He struck me three times. And that hot nurse is sitting nearby filling out her report. You can see her nipples through her dress. 53. Stand here. 51. Do any sports? You should play a sport. - How much did he manage? - 42. - What about me'? - Look at the sheet. Can I redo it'? Same result again. No change. Any surgeries? Go see the doctor. Legs apart. Pull up your shirt. Trousers down, underwear off. Stand up straight! Hands on your hips. Hands on your hips. Are you deaf'? I said stand up straight! Dip it in the water. Otherwise, I can't examine you. Knock it off! Stop it, Max. Stop it. That's enough, Max. You're so embarrassing. If the doctor comes you'll get us in trouble. Max, stop clicking around, OK'? You're last, huh'? - I'm hoping I can avoid it. - No way You have to go to all the rooms. - You got a boner'? - Yeah. If the ruler doesn't work, he'll get you a glass of water. They've added drugs to it. Drink it, and your boner will go right clown. Legs apart. Pull up your shirt. Trousers off. Underwear too! Anyone still to come after you'? Stand up straight! That glass we all clipped our clicks in... That idiot's going to drink the water! How was your “cocktail”? - C'mon, tell us! - He liked it, the faggot! What an idiot. ...urinary tract infection... ...tuberculosis... hepatitis, intestinal parasites, etc. Japanese scientists have discovered that the active agent in stomach cancer, Heliobacter pylori, feeds on cockroach faeces. Scientists believe that risk of the disease is increased in homes where cockroaches are present. If anyone lends money to that idiot or even talks to him then you'll end up like him. You've been warned. Don't even say hello to him. You saw him drink that glass of water. Everyone understand? You can go. He's my eldest daughter's son. She left him with me. I raised him alone. He always washes himself before bed. Sometimes several times. He changes his clothes twice a day I've never seen him smile. He seems worried. I don't know what he's really thinking. Now it's my turn. Allah, please listen to our prayers. White lamb of sacrifice, if you carry the prophet's words, your words are sacred. Is this class 8B'? Hi. My name is Mirsayin. I transferred here from the city What's your name? Asian. What class is after this? History'? I came here this morning with my aunt to collect my timetable. I'm living with her until the end of the year. After that I'll go back to the city My parents are getting divorced. But I don't care, that's their business... You still use these? We use slide projectors now. What's this school like? Any cute girls? You got a girlfriend? - Who sits with you'? - I'm alone. Mind if I sit with you then'? If the teachers aren't okay they can move me back. Let me have a look at your lizard? - Do you respect me'? - We respect you. If you have a complaint, say so. I'm sorry brother. You're sorry? You think I'm your bitch? - How about you? - Bolat, I don't have a penny You don't get it... Do what you have to, I don't want any problems. Get it in your heads. You gotta pay on time. You don't even bring in 1,000. I brought my bosses 4,000 every day And you loaf about all day in the cafeteria. We know. - Is this going to happen again? - No, vve promise. I tell you, if this carries on, things are going to kick off here. Now get lost. And you, shithead. When are you gonna get it together? Where's this last weeks money'? Where am I supposed to get money'? Pull it out your ass, what do I care'? You've got arms and legs haven't you'? You've got a tongue'? Squeeze it out of the littler kids. They're too small. I'll get done. Madi, that's your problem. My little kids pay up every time. You don't bring in shit. I'm broke. I can't ask my mum for more. Poor baby Just put the squeeze on the kiddies. Please don't hit me, Bolat. It hurts, huh'? Get me my money Stop. My legs are black and blue already You can either suffer, or get me some damn money Gandhi during his lifetime received the honorific title Mahatma. He opposed violence. He believed that non-violence is the only solution to any conflict. Gandhi always said: treat your enemies with love, and you can resolve any conflict. India gained independence in 1947, leading to the Partition of India and Pakistan's independence. Gandhi believed in a unified India, and a peaceful coexistence between Hindus and Muslims. On the 13th of November 1948, he began a hunger strike in protest against the government's bloodshed and civil war. After 5 days, the faction leaders pledged to stop the conflict. Gandhi stopped his hunger strike. But 12 days later he was assassinated. Before he died, he forgave his attacker. In 2007 his birthday was declared International Non-Violence Day We will all go to jail sooner or later. Today is our turn, tomorrow it will be yours. Helping our brothers inside is our absolute duty Be charitable, brothers. Your heart will drive you to donate or not. No-one is forcing you. It's our own choice, but if it does some good... She was hot, the girl who owned this phone. Bolat. How's things? This is good, brother. It comes from the heart. Shokan, the guys are getting hesitant. They want to know where the money is going. - And do you doubt me'? - No. Today vve learn about shooting firearms. We'll cover the principles of the gunshot, the components of a weapon, and how to practise. This is a bullet. It consists of a slug, propellant and casing. The primer is inside the casing. The primer is struck, causing it to detonate. That impact ignites the propellant. The detonation of the propellant releases gas. The rapidly expanding gas launches the slug at very high speed. The guys want a word with you. - Mirsayin. - Bolat. Where you from'? Let go of my hand. You from the city? Let me go. I heard you've been extorting kids. We'? Some kid. Get back to work. Akzhan, we've discussed this before. Why won't you listen? - I cannot take off my headscarf. - Why not'? I am a Muslim. Akzhan, vve are all Muslims. But this is a public school. You must wear the school uniform. The school uniform does not protect me. Protect you from what? Impurity... and immorality The Koran says that women should not encourage the desires of men. The boys often stare at me when I don't wear a headscarf. They look at you because you're beautiful. Beauty is a gift from Allah so it's my duty to protect it. Isn't your mother a cleaner here? Yeah, it sucks. Everyone looks clown on me. Asian, I know you're a good guy but Bolat said we're not allowed to talk to you or to say hello. He said he'll kill anyone who dares talk to you. Last time Bolat kicked me so hard. He always goes for the same spot. It's been bruised up like this for over a month. Your shoes are falling apart. I have new ones, Nikes. We went to the city to buy them. But I don't wear them. Why not? I'll wear them someday I'm afraid Bolat will take them. I'd look after that leg. Well, I gotta go. If you need anything, you know where to find me. Never take this off. It will protect you. Why do you always bully the others? How many times do I have to tell you'? You were a long time in the bathroom. I want to make sure my body is clean. Tomorrow you're going to fetch water. You've used it all up. "The other day your face was like a full moon. Your beautiful eyes full of magic were like wild grapes. You were so pure, even the wind could not touch you. Your words could have healed a man." Asian, to the principal's office! Nice one. How are things here'? The kids are grumbling a little, but I can handle it. Takha, some of them are paying directly to Shokan. - What are they paying for exactly'? - For our brothers in prison. We've told Shokan before. Here, we're in charge. We have no brothers in prison. They are all on the outside. Remember that well, or you'll end up inside yourself. You want to go to jail? No. But if you were in prison, would you not need someone's help? We won't ever get caught. We have other plans. We'll soon have graduated. Then we'll leave this dump. But we'll be back from time to time to say hello. We're going to university But vve need someone to take our place. The bosses are looking for someone suitable. We'd like to recommend you. - I'd be in charge? - Correct. - The whole school? - Correct. Keep your troops well drilled. Maybe you'll even earn more than vve do. This school will be yours next year. You haven't been here a week and you're already fighting. And during a lesson, no less! And you've chosen your own seat. Is that how they teach you in the city? Go and sit down. Today we learn how to calculate the area of a circle. We already know, for example if a polygon is composed of multiple polygons then the polygon's total area is the sum of all the smaller areas. To calculate the area of a circle we'll draw a polygon A1 ALAS... Thanks. Great pencil. You can keep it. Who is that Bolat guy'? An asshole. The fight continues even if one of you falls. Blood is not a reason to stop. You will continue until one surrenders. Understand? Let's go. Come on Bolat, punch his head off. - Throw a hook at that ugly face. - Smash him, Bolat. "If a person's thoughts are vain, then he is weak and useless what is he good for then'? But if he speaks loudly and with spirit, and he is careful with his words then such a person is wise. If the child is a master who cares for the weak then he will grow into a fine person. People who never keep their promises are shallow people." I got a cramp and fell down. Max, let's try it! Just once! No way! You maniacs! - Are you going to stop ballbusting us'? - Let me go! Just let me do it once. Hold him. Just one time. Arsen. Do you know the city well? Before I came here I hung out in Happy/on. My mother loaded some money onto this card. You can use it with all the arcade games. You forget about everything in Happy/on. It's like another world. No worries. The people are all friendly and smiling. The girls are super hot. I'm going back to Happy/on next time I'm in the city Akzhan... Are you going home'? Yes. We're going in the same direction. Can I walk you home'? I know you're clever, but I don't know your intentions. Look, Asian! Remember the trainers my aunt bought me'? Well here they are. They're great for football, basketball... it feels like you're flying. You can go out dancing, in the evening. Everyone loves them. Check this out. I'll show you. The soles are really thick. Inside, it fits the arch of your foot. This stitching is hand-sewn. Real leather... Get lost. - What'? - Piss off. Fuck you, you weirdo. How were your lessons? Fine. Did you have lunch yet? Yeah. Grandmother, can a person live without eating meat? Maybe in heaven. Shokan! Asshole. We told you not to ask for money for the people in prison. Very good. You should consider entering the state competition. Physics is not a contest. What is physics for you'? Today's topic is electricity Electricity is a form of energy It brings light to our homes. The eye is the human organ of sight. The eye is built a bit like a camera... I changed my phone. Takha, brother, I didn't give him the money Cut the bullshit. He says you brought him the money in person. What did vve tell you'? Maybe you want to take your racket to other schools? - But Shokan went to our school. - What'? Listen to me. Shokan can go begging elsewhere. We don't give a damn about his prisoners. Nothing to say'? I made a mistake. It won't happen again. If vve see Shokan round here again, you've had it, Bolat. Understand? As long as we're still here, this isn't a charity for prisoners. Understand? And not a word to the bosses. Yesterday vve talked to them about you. They had no objections. But they don't want any problems. - Next time how much should I pay? - The more the better. - You know the rules. - Yeah. Do a good job, or you're dead. Understand? Now fuck off. Go. Madi was taken to the hospital. His whole leg is swollen. Was he in any trouble at school? He left for school wearing his new trainers. When he came home after school, he looked terrified. He was wearing somebody else's old shoes. He lay clown on his bed... and could not stand up again. The doctor took one look at his swollen leg and told me to take him to the city hospital. They may have to amputate his leg due to gangrene. They would out off his leg? Bolat, brother, you know Saken, a fifth grade kid'? He's blackmailing my sister. He dumped her in front of the whole class. She told the teacher he was skipping classes. He took my sister's books and threw them all in the trash. I want you to fix it so he doesn't go near her again. - Saken came to school today? - Yes. I'll talk to him. But tell your sister not to mess with boys' heads. Brother, do you know Aset, from fourth grade? He stole my winter gloves. He promised he'd give them back. But so far, nothing. - What season is it now? - Spring. So why the hell do you care now? It's a matter of principle. A matter of principle? A crappy pair of gloves and you want to talk about principle? - Please don't get angry - What is it'? I got a bad grade in maths. It will affect my average. So what? Try studying harder. Can't you talk to the teacher about changing my grade? Go home, school's finished. Come and eat. I made your favourite meal. Do vve have any potassium? What for'? For chemistry class. Can I have a go with those Nikes? Everyone's here. You all right guys? Today is a very important day Jump. Jump, l said. Breathe. Money comes to me or Max, as usual. Max will collect from the 6th graders. Any questions? No. OK then. Charles Darwin arrived on the Beagle in the Cape Verde islands. He started his research work, intrigued by the birds there. He observed that despite differences in appearance or species, all birds come from the same ancestors. So Darwin proposed his theory of evolution. Through an evolutionary process, all living organisms are subject to a natural selection. Survival of the fittest. And this evolution is hereditary Very good, you can sit down. We will continue studying Darwin's theory... Sit. Sorry to interrupt your lesson. Starting today Bolat will join this class. I hope you will all be a good influence on him. Bakitzhan, you will sit next to Asian. You will sit next to Akzhan. She is very lively and enthusiastic. I cannot sit with him. Akzhan, do not argue! What sort of behaviour is that? I have a right to express my wishes. You can do that when you are studying at a university Who taught you to speak to adults like that? And you call yourself a Muslim? Muslim women should not be so rude. Carry on with your lesson. To understand Darwin's theory let's do some practical work. You will each receive a glass. We will fill the glasses with water from different sources and add some mud to it. Using a microscope, we will observe the propagation of bacteria. Now, your class representative will hand out the glasses. Hey asshole! What are you doing'? - Get outta here! - Bolat, sit down. He's chucking up, look! Sit clown! He's spewing all over! Hey idiot... Bolat, I said sit clown! He's vomiting everywhere. Get him out of here. Get outta here! I'm talking to you! You deaf'? Hey asshole- You want to defend him? Everyone's supposed to ignore him. I said I'd beat anyone who didn't listen. And l will. I'm going to turn everyone against him. Don't mess with me. You're as dumb as him. Got any money'? Let's go to the city Go to Happy/on. We don't need much money Just enough for a round-trip. We'll take the bus. One change, and we'll be in Happy/on. You'll forget everything there. Everyone is warm, everyone smiles. We can ask girls to go to the movies with us. There's enough credit on the card for both of us. Shall vve go'? Come on I'll take you home. According to preliminary investigations, a demonstration bullet was found in your classroom. Also, our experts found traces of blood. I want you to recall what happened the clay before yesterday The day Bolat Nurbekov was murdered. He had just changed classes... during biology class Bolat started a fight. The investigators... also found fragments of pencil on the victim's throat. Students rarely use this type of pencil. Do you know who uses such a pencil? - How's it progressing? - Still interrogating people. - Which classes? - Third and fourth grades. Talk to the older kids too. From first grade to seniors. Especially the girls. They always notice things. So you carry no live ammunition? Only demonstration bullets. Where are the demo bullets stored'? In the utility room. Have you seen any students clown there? No, nobody It's off-limits to them. Shall I send them both in'? No, one by one. Mirsayin, go in. Asian, wait here. Asian, sit down. Did they already interrogate you'? What did they ask? What happened the day before yesterday I heard you were sick in biology is that true'? And you went home with Mirsayin'? Yes. Was the fight one-on-one or were there several boys'? I don't know. He didn't tell you anything when you went home'? I didn't ask. Did you have geometry class today? Yes. Let me see your workbooks. Show me your pencils. Not that one. The one you used for these drawings. Mirsayin, you can't find your pencil? Both of them have blood on their pants and shoes. Start an arrest report. - For both of them'? - Yes. I have to phone my parents. Empty your pockets. Jackets off. Faster! Nothing in these pockets'? Take your shirts off. - What's this? - My talisman. - Take it off. - No. Take off your talisman. Come on, take it off, I make the rules here! You don't understand? - Cell number 4. - And the other'? There was a brawl last night. We've no empty cells. So I put them in together'? No shit. You think I'm taking them home'? Come on. Let's go. The shooter didn't know it was just a demo bullet. It was a blank shell. He got scared, so he used a pencil to stab the victim's throat. Hit an artery Then he used a length of fire hose to tie the deceased up and threw him into the sewer. Very simple. We just need to figure out which one of them did it. They both had blood on them. Both their pencils were missing. They also both have a motive. Long story short, We have 48 hours to find out the truth. Did you kill him? No. Bolat teased him in front of everyone. I felt sympathy for him. Did you fight with Bolat or did they all set on you'? Bolat could have fought me without his friends. Asian said that he went home with you'? Yes. But vve split halfway Where did he go then'? To his home. Couldn't he have returned to school? No. I saw him go home. - Are you sure'? - Yes. Mirsayin, vve have a lot of evidence against you. The blood on your clothes, your missing pencil... Bolat was probably killed with your pencil. Everybody knows you had... a problem with Bolat. And you just said that Aslan returned to his home. All this can prove you killed Bolat. Write your confession. You'll go to the madhouse for a while and you'll get out on good behaviour. You can go back to the city on probation. Mirsayin, I can't help you much longer. So write. No, I won't write it. I didn't kill him. Bolat picked on you in biology class. Mirsayin defended you. Then Bolat and his pals beat Mirsayin up. Is Mirsayin really your friend? His parents came to take him back home. Did you know... in his statement, he hangs you out to dry He will testify against you in a murder trial. Write it all down. How you killed Bolat. Confess to everything and your sentence will be reduced. I didn't kill him. You killed him together'? Are you gonna talk'? I'm listening. He would give them money every week. He was collecting for his big brothers, right'? Yes. Do you believe in God'? This is yours, right'? Yes. Do you know what's inside? It's a prayer written on a piece of paper. It says: "Undertake all your actions in the name of Allah the merciful. For if you ask His forgiveness with a pure heart, you will receive it." Do this for your own sake, Asian. Your testimony about the racket will lighten your sentence. Admit to your crimes. I did not kill him. Arms up. Higher. Higher! Arms up. Higher. Higher! Even higher! I told you to hold your arms up. Arms straight. Stand up and start again. Faster. Arms straight. Straight out! Pick up the books. Arms straight. Straight out! I did not kill him. Then who was it'? There's a fat woman on the door, dressed all in white. Behind her there's a fountain. At night it's lit up, like all the trees around. On the first floor there are fancy shops. And great restaurants on the second. And I have the Happy/on card. You listening, Asian? Look at this. Get up, you're not at home! Hurry up and get down. Move it! This isn't a hotel. What if they really didn't kill him? This is just a job. Don't give it too much thought. I should have stayed a history teacher. It's in God's hands now. Get up. Everyone is waiting. Where's Mirsayin'? We don't have much time. You said that Bolat and his pals beat you up. - Yes. - Where'? Outside. Where exactly'? Behind the school. This is your pencil? Yes. Take a good look. It's mine. I must have dropped it. I need you to do one thing. The day of the murder, write that after Asian walked you home, he did not go home but returned to the school. This way you'll be free in a matter of hours. Okay? What were you thinking? Why put both of them in the same cell? What else could I do'? The cells were all full. I couldn't put them in with condemned prisoners. We have to find a solution. That little devil was always one step ahead of us. He out his own throat with a sharpened spoon. He knew Mirsayin would try to stop him. When Mirsayin tried to help him, Asian attacked him by surprise and smashed his head on the edge of the bed. Mirsayin died on the spot from a cerebral haemmorrhage. Just like with Bolat's death, Asian planned the whole operation to put the blame on Mirsayin and thus walk free. Same wound, same type of weapon. Asian is almost certainly the murderer. And you had to go and lock them in the same cell. You realise you're responsible for that? But there were no more cells! Our 48 hours are up. We need to make a decision. The first lizards lived in the age of dinosaurs. Their descendants are still alive today. Originating 250 million years ago, lizards have survived easily. Lizards are equipped with excellent survival skills. In the age of the dinosaurs lizards faced a variety of dangers. What now, Sir'? Go back to class. Did you tell them'? Yeah I told 'em. - Why aren't they here'? - How do I know? - You should have been more clear. - You got a problem'? Arsen, where are you going'? - Sanzhar Kalabayev? - Present. - Meruert Kudaibergenova? - Present. - Akzhan Niyazbekova'? - She transferred to another school. - Ardak Medetov'? - Present. - Chingiz Omarov? - Present. Guys, stop pissing about. Every Friday I need to have 5,000. Excuses like "I couldn't get it" aren't going to out it. Anyone who grasses is going to meet some mean dudes. They'll teach you a lesson in pain. Do you understand? I can't give you an answer. I must discuss it with my brothers. Where are your brothers? Go and speak with them, so vve can get this sorted. Be generous, boys, be generous. Who's taking over now? I forgot to give you this back. Asian, come and join us! Cross the lake. Come here! Asian, come and join us! Come with us! Do not be afraid, Asian. You can walk on the water. Do you hear me'? Cross the lake!
