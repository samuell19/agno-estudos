Okay, okay, okay. Please, please, please. The easy way? No, no, no, no. What are you... Or the hard way? Jesus. Please, please. No, no, no. No, no, no, no. Please, please, please. Please! I'm not going back to that place. This is Officer Harold, 101, officer down. I've been shot in the knee. Hey, Harold, was the girl armed? Hey, what happened, buddy? Harold? So the bullet entered the back of the leg. There is some cartilage damage, some muscle damage, some nerve damage. Luckily the bullet missed your kneecap, Officer. That's a wrecking ball at close range. He was with me. Mm-hmm. Right. She's scary. It'll be right up. I see you, Ray. What? Looking at her. Man, you tripping, Irene. I'm tripping? Yeah. I'm tripping.

But, like, you can just make them do whatever you want? You could control all the fucking pricks out there with just your mind? I mean, wow. I knew something freaky was gonna happen tonight. I can just feel it, you know? When it's a full moon, I, like, feel it in my ovaries, I swear to God. You don't really sound like you're from around here. I mean, you live in New Orleans? I'm not going back there. What, did you, like, run away from somewhere? I don't wanna go back there! I don't wanna go back there! I don't wanna go back there! Okay, it's all right, it's all right.

She's fine. She's freaking out. It's all right. Sit down. Come on. Come on. It's all right. Hello. Would you mind your own fucking business and turn around and eat your own food? Just eat your food. Turn the fuck around. Hey, you okay? Honestly, you don't gotta tell me nothing. It's none of anybody's beeswax, including me, all right? So just relax, eat your fries. Won't find a better place than Bourbon Street. Come on in, free jazz, right now. Come, come. Ass and titties, y'all. Ass and titties. Come in here. Ass and titties, man. Ass and titties. Yeah, man. Let's go. Come on, let's go inside. Ass and titties. Hey, baby. Hey, Snacky. Hi, baby. Hey. This is my new friend, Mona Lisa. Hey. Mona Lisa? I got you a strawberry milk shake and a Dr Pepper. I didn't know which one you wanted. Bye, Mona Lisa. Yeah. Ass and titties, y'all. Ass and titties. All right, fellas, give it up for La Porsche. You need those titties in your face, bro. Hey, look. Come here for a second. Get this douche some fucking shots of Jäger. Don't forget our three-dollar hot and spicy wings, four-dollar Jägerbombs and of course our ten-dollar hookahs. Get your dollar bills ready because next up on the stage, sweet as vanilla ice cream, the American wet dream, Bonnie Belle. Hey there, baby. Come on. Show us what you got there. We want to order four shots. Four shots for all. This is no bullshit. Hey, baby, how are you doing there? What you looking to get into? Hey, sweetheart, over here. Yeah, that's it. How much for your little titties in my face? All right, fellas, give it up for Bonnie Belle! Let's go. This place is a bust. Tipping for the stripping. That's how it works here, guys. 'Cause these ladies are making a living off of what you're giving. Like I said earlier, I want you guys to reach down into your pockets, grab those dollar bills, don't be shy. Here you go. Okay. And make it rain on these ladies. Thanks. Look, she's gonna have to work for that tip, man. Oh, my God, really? All right. All right. That's $40. Smack that ass, man. Yeah. Fuck, yeah.

And how about saying thank you? Now I can get that pack of gum I've been saving up for. It should've been you. You're supposed to hook this motherfucker up with that shit, huh? I think those kids have been here too many times, that's why. All right, fellas, give it up for Dice. Two dollars is two dollars. She's got an ass like a pumpkin, make you wanna put a face on it. I wanna thank everybody for coming out this Wednesday evening here at The Panty Drop, 'cause we've got a lot of ladies here for you tonight. Here. Next up on the stage... It's apple juice... put your hands together for Marguerite. I liked watching you. Yeah? You are pretty. Thanks, hon. What is this place for? What's it for? It's for guys. They pay to watch girls dance and take their clothes off and stuff. Why? 'Cause they like naked girls. Because you are pretty? Yeah. 'Cause we're pretty. Yeah. Because we're really fucking pretty, aren't we? This is Mona Lisa. I wanted her to meet you guys. Is that okay? Yeah, she... she's not our type. That's okay. She's never been to a strip club before so I was just explaining to her how it works. Like, naked girls are the best thing in the world, right? Your favorite? Yeah, I mean, I guess. Like, of all the pretty things on the entire planet, butterflies, waterfalls, rainbows, et cetera, naked girls are the best, right? What the fuck is she talking about? You got me. Remember when you tipped me two dollars? That wasn't enough, was it? Was it? So what you're gonna do is you're gonna go into your pocket and your wallet, you're gonna take all the money out and you're gonna hand it over. What? Yeah, to properly show me your appreciation. Nah, I'm not. Yeah, you are. Man, this chick's fucking crazy. Fuck that. Mona, you wanna help me out with this a little bit? Randy. Randy, what the fuck are you doing? Don't give her that money. What are you doing, bro? Giving me money. Romeo, take your wallet out, show your appreciation now. I'm not giving you my money. Yo, he's not giving you his money. What's wrong with you, lady? He said no. Bro, what are you doing? I don't know. I'm not doing this. I'm not giving her this money. Shit, I can't move now. Baby face, take your wallet out. I don't know how to explain it. Thank you very much. What's going on? You guys are the fucking best. You've made my night. This is so great. No, no, no. Thank you. Give us our money back, you cunt. Excuse me? You heard me, bitch. Whoa. You just called me a cunt and then a bitch? Fuck you. Give us our money back. Go with your goddamn bullshit. No, this bitch scammed us. Get the fuck... She fucking scammed us. Put it in our drinks. Get your fucking hands off me. No, fuck that. Get your fucking hands off me, man. Bye, boys. Wave goodbye. Bye-bye. You little shit. What are you doing up so late? It's 4:00 in the morning. I heard noises. This is my son, Charlie. Say hi, Charlie. All right, Mona, you can sleep here. And, um, this is the remote for the television. That's volume and the channel... There's, uh, juice in the fridge. Just make yourself at home, all right? Both the bowie knife and the tan to knife are forged in one piece... Float into a sprint to see if you can make it turn red. The secret is Waterpik's patented whitening infuser technology that... I don't have any clean shirts. Then you need to do your laundry. I don't have any money. Go get my purse. All right. So... that girl in there made Mommy a lot of money tonight. All right? Let's not fuck it up, okay? Okay? Don't fuck it up, all right? Be nice. I'm going to bed. You need to go to bed. It's super late. And I think you got school in the morning. Allow 30 seconds for the can to discharge fully, then unscrew the nozzle. According to the Pentagon... Weight Zone guides you through different levels of resistance to... We, in turn, would give them a degree of sanctions relief. That, to me, would be the possibility of real diplomacy. It wouldn't solve the problem. It might cap it or manage it. That would be meaningful. But what we saw the other day? No, that, in and of itself, is... ...highlighting the international nature of the Iranian threat. This was an unprovoked attack. We must be protected. What else can you tell me about her? Like, what kind of patient was she? Like having no psycho motor activity, no interaction with the outside environment, nothing. It's like being dead when you're still alive. And she's been in here 12 years? Twelve, I mean, yeah. She came here at ten, but that was before I was here so I don't know what she was like then. But for the past ten years, she ain't did nothing but drew. She asked you for chips and then you pressed the alarm? I pressed it then, yes. Then you walked over to the monitor, hit your head, knocked yourself unconscious, during which time she escaped from the building? You do know my drug test came back clean, right? I was not high or drunk that night. Something else happened that night, right? Something you're not telling anybody else about. I don't even know what happened. She was standing there looking at me. And I was staring in her eyes and she did something to me. It felt like a fever. Like a cold chill came down inside me and I could not move. But then I felt myself moving. She made me hit my head on the TV. I couldn't even control my own damn body. You know what? I can't explain it. Just know she was doing all of it. You think I'm crazy, right? That's what I would think, too, if I was you. You wanna know the truth? Well, I think that that girl is a demon. Demon? Yes, like a for-real-life demon. She possessed me. So what is it then? Do you think I was possessed? Look at you, dying for an explanation... ...trying to give everything a name, fooling yourself into thinking you're in control, boy. It ain't right. That's the fact. She can't be out here just running loose, something like that. That girl is the same as she was yesterday and the day before that. The fact is, the only thing that's changed is you. How do I stop her from doing it again? What makes you think I can stop her? Is there any way to protect yourself from it? Here, take this chicken leg, put it over your door. Matter of fact, there's a whole bunch of 'em over here. Take 'em. That's it? Talking a bunch of mumbo jumbo with a snake, trying to look all smooth. Some chicken feet? That's the best you got? Well, the best way to protect yourself is to leave her alone. Besides you don't pick voodoo, son. Voodoo pick you. All right, him. See that guy? Remember what I said, right? You remember? Now, come on. Hey, excuse me. Is that working now? 'Cause it ate my card a second ago. Yes, it's working. Aw, look at your cute dog. Do it now, Mona. Make him push the buttons I say. Withdrawal. What's happening? Be quiet. Savings. 500. There you go. That's right, Mona. Thank you. Hey, taxi. All right, let's go. Hurry it up. Come on. Get the dog. Let's go. All right, here, take the dog. All right, to the airport. Four different people, four different ATMs in the same day? I mean, something's up. A couple prostitutes scamming people in the streets is what's up. Surveillance video shows the whole thing. The guy literally hands over the money. He's just pissed he didn't get a blow job. One of the victims was a woman. Did she want a blow job? I don't know, it's a crazy world. What y'all talking about? So get this. A guy comes in here today and says that he got robbed by two women at an ATM. I said, "How'd they get your money? With a knife, with a gun? How'd they get it?" He goes, "They hypnotized me." And the guy looked normal. Complete fucking nutjob. I thought I was gonna have to tase him to calm him down. I mean, can you believe this garbage? Come on, it's New Orleans. People are out of their minds, drinking daiquiris at eight o'clock in the morning. Degenerates, drunks, and nutjobs everywhere. When was this? Earlier today. You wanna see it? Go into the system, pull up the case file. It's there about, uh, 2:00 p.m. Can I have one of these? Mmm. Did I say you could have one? No. Mmm. You're getting sleepy. I just hypnotized him and he's sharing his egg rolls. Damn it, Martin. How's your knee doing? It's got a hole in it. And the gun just went off, huh? You gotta be more careful. I'm serious. Hey, Pete, do me a favor. Pull up a picture of Mona Lee, the one who escaped from HOMIA. What you thinking, Harold? Is that the Chinese girl that hopped HOMIA a couple days ago? Mona Lisa Lee. She's not Chinese. She's Korean. Oh, I know that one. That's Bonnie Belle. She's a dancer at one of the strip clubs down on Bourbon Street. And how is it you know that, Martin? Oh, come on, me? I never forget a face. Which strip club? I can't remember which one. Put the blue one on. And then, like, put the orange glasses on there. The orange. Mm-hmm. Love that. Hey, where you been, huh? Walking around. Okay, well, I got you food and I saved you a fortune cookie. Why is she still here? Well, she's got no place to stay. I'm helping her out for a little while. Since when you do help people? Hey, what's the matter with you? Sit down, eat some Chinese food, relax. I'm not hungry. Okay, well, I'ma save you an egg roll. Mona, he's like on his period or something. It's loud. What do you want? What are you doing? Hashing. Do you mind? What is hashing? I don't know, it's like dancing aggressively. You know, like, to metal. Why do you do it? 'Cause I'm mad. I had a shitty day. Anyway, it helps. Gets the aggression out. You just freak out and it just feels good. So you don't stay stuck. I wanna do it. Show me. You want the space around. Let it all go. Let it go. That's Hellfire. It's one of my favorites. The world's burning, she's burning, but she's dancing. She never lets the pain show. Is that your only shirt? So how did you meet my mom? She bought me a hamburger. What do you think of her? Do you like her? Yeah. Yeah, she's pretty good at making people like her, if she wants. She hates me. Can you tell? No. She totally does. She blames me for everything, how shitty her life is, and, like, all the stuff she never gets to do. It's all 'cause of me. It's my fault. What happened to your face? Oh. Paulie Paulson. This kid from school. He's a total dickhead. What's a dickhead? A dickhead is, like, um, a totally lame person. They find what you hate most about yourself and make fun of you for it. Do you have any friends? Do you wanna go do something? What do you like to do for fun? I like to sleep. Yeah, sleeping's cool. What do you like to do for fun? You wanna see? No, don't move. Hold still. Don't worry, it's almost finished. It's the Mona Lisa. Ooh! Ah! Ooh, got one! Yeah, I don't wanna go to art school or sell my stuff in galleries, but I just like drawing 'cause it's soothing. I've been doing it all my life. Hey, loser. Shit. Yeah, I see you, you little shit. When I get you, I'm gonna beat the hell outta you. It's Paulie Paulson, that kid from school. I know you can't hide. The dickhead? Yeah. I'm gonna get you, you little shit. No, what are you doing? Wait. Move. Leave him alone. I said move. I said, leave him alone. Get out of my way. Look. What's he doing? Ooh! Whoa! Oh. No. Leave him alone. Do you understand? Nod if you understand. Let's go, man. Come on, let's go. Come on, let's go. What kind of a creature are you? Just a man. A man? Hello? Look at you two. Snug as a couple of bugs. I got pizza. Mom? Mmm. Yeah? Mom, I... I've gotta tell you something about Mona Lisa. It's gonna sound crazy. She has special powers. I'm talking, like, supernatural abilities. She could do mind control, Mom. It's amazing. I'm being serious. Hey. You didn't say anything to anyone, did you? No. Good. Wait, do you know about this? Yeah, I know. She helped me clean house at the club the other night. It was amazing. She's a little miracle. She's a fugitive, Mom. Don't you think we should help her? I am helping. You're not helping her. You're helping yourself. She was on the streets, okay? I took her in. She likes it here. Everything is fine, all right? And, hey, guess what? Who's the boss of this house? Me, not you. Quit bugging me. So what, she's gonna stay here and live with us? I don't know, yeah, for a while. Then what? Then, I don't know, Charlie, but, you know, maybe I can afford a nice car. Maybe I can get you really nice paints. Do you even realize how huge this is? The second I walk in the door, huh? You gotta do this the second I walk in the door. I mean, one good thing happens to us, one good thing finally happens, and you've gotta be a pain in the ass. All right, you ready to go? Get your shoes on. Let's go. Come on, here, put this on. We've gotta go. Put your glasses on too. She doesn't want to go. She wants to watch the movie. She can finish it later. You don't own her. I know I don't own you, all right? Just ignore him. He's being a brat for some reason. She's just using you to make money. Hey, quit it, all right? No, I'm not. That's the only thing you ever care about. Money. Don't act like you care about her. You don't give a shit about anybody but yourself. Okay, wait a minute. What's this about, huh? What's up your ass, honey? I can't wait to get out of this shithole and get away from you. Yeah, well, there's the door, all right? Knock yourself out. Do you even see yourself? Look at you. Look at your clothes, all that shit on your face. All right. No one should be around you. You're toxic. You know what? You're pissed. And you're being a jerk and you're saying things that you don't mean. I do mean it. I'm gonna let this one slide 'cause you're just a dumb kid. And as smart as you think you are, I'm smarter. No, you're not. Don't forget to lock this door behind us. Come on, Mona, let's go. Have a lot of fun out here, let's go. T-shirts, five for 20. T-shirts, five for 20. There they are. Hey, big boy. Excuse me. Do you know a dancer here named Bonnie Belle? Mm-mmm. No. Hey, you know a dancer here by the name of Bonnie Belle? Mm-mmm. ATMs are fast, you know, but they're high risk. This is so cool 'cause it's easy. And then we just switch between the two and lay low for a while. I'm just out of money, man. I'm tapped. Get the hell out of here, man. Why not, man? Sorry, baby, I've got nothing left. - Yo, what the fuck is going on? - No, I'm out. Y'all got some bad mojo in here. I don't know what the hell that was. Why did they all leave? What the fuck is it my fault if they leave? 'Cause I know you doing some shit. All right, come on. Maybe they just don't like you, Dice. You know what? 600. What? I ain't even tripping. All right. 'Cause karma's gonna fuck you up, bitch. Yeah, whatever. Yeah, whatever. Sleep with one eye open. Point your little watery eyeballs someplace else. Fucking cheap-ass lashes on my forehead. Excuse me. Do you have a dancer here called Bonnie Belle? She's blonde. Well, we got all kind of girls in there. Blondes, redheads, brunettes, corn rows, Afros, dreadlocks. Yeah, we got all the flavors of the rainbow. No, I'm looking for a specific person. It's a police matter. Bonnie Belle. That don't ring a bell. I'll take a look around, all right? Yeah, that's $30. Wait, I'm just playing. Come on in. Oh, shit. What the fuck is this? Shit, come on. We gotta go. Do you know where I can find Bonnie Belle? That tight-ass ho is back there. Don't lose me. Stay right behind me, Mona. Hey! Police. Stop! Oh! Shit. Hey! Just walk. Just walk. We'll lose him. Bonnie! Baby, look at that guy on the stilts. Did you see that? Stop! Stop those ladies. Two for one, right there. Stop! Hey! Stop running, Bonnie. Mona Lisa Lee, stop! Don't look back. Don't look back. Stop! Police! Stop. Stop now. All right, come on. Ow. Ah. Shit. Stop running. Shit. Shit. Here. Stop! Did you not hear me screaming, "Stop, police"? Huh? No, I didn't hear anything. So why are you running? I'm just late, that's all. This is 101, Officer Harold. 10-28, I need back up. I got eyes on escaped mental patient, Mona Lisa Lee. I'm at the south side of Bourbon Street at the alley behind Frenchmen. Send backup now. Ms. Lee, I need you to turn and face the wall. Now. Turn your eyes toward the wall. Can I... Can I go? Your eyes and your hands. No, you may not go. You turn around too. Okay. I'm just saying, I think there's been some kind of misunderstanding because I don't even know this girl. You don't know who she is? No. Did you know who she was when you were at the ATM machines robbing people yesterday? No, I... I... I have no idea what you're talking about. I don't. You can watch on the surveillance cameras then. Here... ...put those on her. Bend down slowly, pick them up, and walk them over to her. She came into the club a couple days ago. And, you know, I was being nice. So I gave her a place to stay and... Quiet down. Stop talking. I hardly know her. Listen. Put 'em on her. I got it. Then can I go? No. Put the handcuffs on now. I really think that you should do this, okay? I promise, everything is gonna be okay. I promise. Just put them on. Just put them on. What's the hold up? He's a cop. What do you expect? Oh, my God. What are you doing? Mona. I don't think this is the best idea. What the hell is going on? I don't... I don't know what she's doing. I don't think this is the right thing to do. All right? This is mine. All right. Stay back. Stay back. Stay away from me. Stay away from me. Stay the fuck away from me. Why do you think you're in charge? That's not gonna work this time. Because of this? Fuck, fuck, fuck. In a minute... In a minute, there's gonna be 12 cops around here. What you gonna do then, huh? Goddamn it, whatever this is, devil worship, voodoo, hypnosis, it's not right. You can't fix yourself by hurting other people. You like people? Do you like them? What? People, do you like them? Mmm? Do you like people? Yeah. I like people. Why do you like them? I don't know. I just like them. You like people, and you don't know why? Maybe you don't really like them. Because people are not so easy to like. I don't like you anymore. Where are you going? Shit. Hey, go get these keys off my belt. Here, help me out here. Come here. Come get these keys off my belt. Come here now. Help me with these cuffs. Come grab these keys. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Don't do this. Bonnie, don't do this! Come back here! Fuck! Yo, yo. Hey, hey! Shit. Ouch. Shit. I'm leaving. Why are you going now? They're coming. Who? Who's coming? The po-liss. The what? The police? Oh, shit. Where's my mom? I don't know where she is. I mean, this really sucks. I like you, Charlie. I know, I like you too. Then come with me. Wait. Like, come with you? Yeah. Like right now? Let's leave this house. Ow. All right. Where you going, honey? Come on. What's up, girl? What? What's up? Hey, hey, hey, where you going, baby? Yo, slow up. Remember us? Oh, right. Yeah. We want our money back, bitch. All of it. Oh, come on. Are you serious right now? I'm very serious. All right, relax a little bit. Take it easy, come on. All right, I got it. I mean... I might not have all of it. Oh, you don't have all of it? No, not on me. Come on. That's a big problem for you. Look, I'll give you... There's no hard feelings here, guys. Give me it. I'll just give you what I got, you know? I don't know. Count up this shit, bro. I mean, here's... I had more earlier. I can get more. This is not everything. I can go back and get some more. No, you ain't going anywhere. You're staying right here. All right. You got a light, then? Yeah? Yeah. So, you gonna fuck me? Should we get it over with? You know what I mean? Like, what is this? Man, whoever said anything about fucking you? All right, then what the fuck? I told you I don't have your money. Ah, fuck. Yeah, you like it rough. Don't you, bitch, huh? Take it easy. Bitch. What should we do? Okay, we need a plan or something. I have $2,000. Maybe we should, like, just stay at a hotel or something? I mean, like, lay low for a sec. What should we do? We need a plan. Like, where should we go? Yeah, man, we could do that. Yo, you wanna hit that spot? He was trying to look at my ass. Girl, I told you. Hey. Yo, didn't I tell you I was gonna see this girl again? Yo. Yo, ask him. Man, I knew you was gonna find me. You styling in my shirt. Yo. You know this guy? What's up, pip-squeak? My name's Charlie. I'm tired. Then sit down. So where do you guys know each other from? I'm pretty sure we're soul mates, homey. Are you a drug dealer? Now, why you gotta ask that? I don't know. You look like one. Well, I may deal some drugs once in a while, but that don't make me no drug dealer. I'm a deejay, baby boy. Don't call me baby boy. Well, don't call me no drug dealer then. Damn. So where are we going? First things first. Take the bag second. We have a new development in the search for escaped mental patient, Mona Lisa Lee. Lee and another woman, identified as Bonnie Hunt, an exotic dancer at The Panty Drop on Bourbon Street, were seen together late last night by a police officer in the French Quarter. Police believe that Mona Lisa Lee is traveling with a juvenile male, age 11, Charles, or Charlie, Hunt. Can you believe this? An Amber Alert has been issued for Charlie Hunt. We're on the news. Lee escaped from a maximum security ward. Yo. Hey, man, what's up? She's believed to be armed and dangerous. The Louisiana state police have launched a full-scale search for Lee and the young boy. Yeah? Any information... We'll be there in 15. Yo, you ready? Ms. Hunt? You're in the emergency room. You were attacked last night and badly injured. Two fingers on your left hand are broken and you have four cracked ribs. So it's best if you remain still, all right? Please remain still. Good news is there appears to be no internal bleeding. That's good news. And as soon as you're stable, we'll send you in to operate on the fingers. The CAT scan shows no damage to the brain, although you do have cranial swelling. My kid. And the pressure may cause some discomfort. Someone needs to call my kid. Can someone hand me my phone please? The police are here. They're going to talk to you about that. Officer? What the fuck? Ugh. This guy. What do you know about that girl? Any idea where they might be headed? No. You don't know where your son would go if he left home? Neighbor, relative, friends? Tell me something about Mona Lisa Lee. I don't know anything about her, all right? I let her stay at my house for a little bit. That's it. Do you realize I could arrest you right now, Ms. Hunt? Yeah, for what? Harboring a fugitive wanted for violent crimes, not to mention multiple robberies you are an accessory to. You can prove that? Jesus, your 11-year-old son is right now with a very dangerous person and you're gonna sit here acting like nothing's happening? Shame on you. Shame on you, young lady. Don't talk to me like that. Fuck you. No. Uh-huh. I'll talk how I want to talk to you. No. Your guilt trips are not gonna work on me, all right? I know you were with her. I saw you with her. I chased you down a goddamn street on one leg. Honestly, you look like a really decent guy, and stuff like that, but I'm... Shit ain't all roses in my life. Yeah, yeah, shit ain't all roses for me, okay? Look at my fucking face. What the fuck? I'm trying to help you. Does it look like my life is going pretty good? Huh? Don't you wanna find your son? What the fuck is your question? Do I wanna see my kid again? Is that it? That's your question? Yes. Do you want to see your son, yeah. Yes, I would like to see my kid again. I love him. And I'd actually like to see him right fucking now. That's what I really... Then help us! Maybe I don't deserve to because I'm a shitty fucking mother. Why don't you just go ahead and arrest me? All right? I'm all yours, I'm right here. I've got nothing else to do but have a couple of surgeries. Okay, people are gonna ask for your ID so you always have to have it in your hand. And then you have to buy tickets and go through security. You have to take off your shoes and stuff and put your bag in, um, this X-ray machine. Just follow me. It's easy. Then you have to put your seat belt on and just do what I do. It's not that hard. Yo, you nervous, homey? No. I mean, you seem nervous. Relax, yo. I can't help it. Y'all need those... Those chill vibes, you know? Yo... chew on this. Here you go. You know, if you, uh... if you look chill, you feel chill. And vice versa. You know, for example, if you're chewing gum, that's mad stylish, yo. I mean, look at you. Man, you ain't worried. You're just chewing, right? Right. Right. All right, y'all, we there. All right, party people. Hey, put these on. Now I put some music on here. Just some stuff that reminds me of your vibe. Man, I hate goodbyes, man. Get me all teary and shit. Can I get a kiss? Come here. Thank you, Fuzz. Hey, ain't no thing but a chicken wing. Hey, you listen to that first track real loud, all right? Yeah. All right. Yeah, I'm gonna see you in the sequel. Hey, little man. You got this. Later. Go on now, pip-squeak. Go get it. Hi, can I help you? What's the next flight out of here? The next flight? All right, let's see. I've got a Cleveland leaving at 8:45. I have a Tulsa leaving at 9:55. Oh, and here's a Detroit with seats available leaving at 8:35. Starts boarding in 15 minutes. Um, how much for two tickets? Two tickets? That's $883. Uh, in cash? Yeah. Okay. Okay. Um, I'm gonna have to see photo ID of both travelers. Would you like window or aisle? You like the window, right? Yeah. All right, great. And what about you... Wolfgang? I'll do window as well. All right. Here are your boarding passes. That is Gate A6, down the hall to the right, through security. Have a wonderful flight. It worked. It actually worked. Um, I just need to think for a second. Can you sit down? I don't believe this. This is... I... I just gotta pee before we go through security. You stay right here. Don't move. I'll be back. I promise. Don't worry, gonna be right back. If you look chill, you feel chill. Look chill, feel chill. Come on. Um, sir, can I use your phone? Sorry, I just forgot to call my mom. It's a local number. Uh, sure. Thank you. I think it's him, Harold. Give it to me. Okay. Give me the phone. Just one second, all right. Got it. Let me answer the phone, come on. Answer it. Put it on speaker. Hello? Hello? - Hello? - Mom, it's me. Oh, my God, Charlie, where the fuck are you? I'm not mad. I just wanna know where you are and I'm gonna send someone to come get you. Listen. I want you... to do all the things you want to do with your life. Promise me that. Charlie, what the fuck are you talking about, all right? You're freaking me out. You don't have to worry about me anymore, okay? I'm gonna be fine. Don't worry. Where are you? Just don't feel bad about anything. No, no, Charlie. All right? Charlie. Bye, Mom. Charlie, no, no, no, don't hang up. Don't hang up. I love you. Fuck. What you got? What the fuck? We got it. They're at the airport. Thanks. You're welcome, son. Good luck. You too. And we're en route to Louis Armstrong Airport, over. We're looking for an Asian girl and a 10-year-old boy. Brown hair, brown eyes. Put their pictures up in the system. Send all available units to the airport. Get them to check those departing flights. Let's not miss this one, guys, all right? Notify TSA as well. We do not want to miss this one, people. Let's move. If you see this girl, do not look in her eyes. I know it sounds weird. Just don't do it. Thank you. Glasses please. Thank you. All right, everyone, take off your shoes, put 'em in the tub. Yep, laptops, tablets, any electronics, put it in the tub. Make sure you don't have anything left in your bag. Let me get your backpack. Step through, please. Step through. Here we are, here we are, here we are. Let's go, let's go, let's go. Okay, come through. Step over here, ma'am. Raise your arms, please. I'm gonna frisk you. Hold out your arms. Check your pockets. Okay. You're going here. All right, check Dallas, Tulsa, Detroit. Check all IDs, everyone on board. Let's move. Yeah, we need an officer to check IDs on Flight 644 headed to Detroit. Sheldon here at Gate A6 to Detroit. I'm on it. Keep your eyes open for a juvenile boy. Copy that. We just need to ask for everyone's cooperation. Cooperation for what? This is a police matter. I think people have a right to know what's going on. It's a security precaution. Need to check the IDs of every passenger. Paging traveler Ronaldo Green. Ronaldo Green, please come to the Gate A3 counter, please. You've misplaced your boarding pass and it's been returned to the counter. I'm never doing this again. Okay, we need to close these into one line. One line, please. Make a path, people. Make a path, please. This is the final boarding call for Flight 644 to Detroit.

We're gonna fill out some paperwork. Gonna sue you, Pete, Sheldon... Then you'll be on your way. Whatever. It's not her. Where's the kid? Oh. Excuse me, sorry. Oh. Yeah. No, I can do this. You're in a lot of trouble, son. Some serious trouble. I know you two were getting on the same flight. Now, if you're smart, like I know you are, you'll tell me exactly what flight she's on.

Hear it click? Yeah. Pull it tight over you. Pull it tight. No, that's... That's tight enough. It's your first time flying, huh? Freaking stuck here because you can't tell the difference between two Asian women? That is so freaking racist. Like, really. I'm gonna tweet, Facebook, Instagram... Ma'am, I need you to calm down. I have to be somewhere tomorrow. Like, I need to go. We just did a sweep of the Tulsa flight... I have somewhere to be. ...and that's a negative ID on the Tulsa flight. All clear. So you're gonna lie to the police now? I... I'm not lying. What flight is she on, Charles? I swear, I don't know. Tell me what flight she's on, goddamn it! Take it easy, Harold. He knows. He's lying. What are you doing? You can't see that? I'm not. I'm not. Charles, tell me where she is. What are you doing, man? You think she's your friend? Well, she's not. Tell me the truth. Where is Mona Lisa?
