SCHOOL GIRL REPORT 10 Every Girl Starts Sometime Well, ladies, I admit that the word, "conventions"... ...is somewhat misleading. How else could it be described? Maybe as "morals"? Excellent! You see, the societal sanctions against the violation of morals... ...are considerably stronger. And the awareness of moral values... ...then becomes the basis for our laws. No thanks. You don't agree with that, Iris? No, I think the legal system and morality are two completely different things. But laws are based on morals... ...otherwise, they wouldn't be laws. You're both right. Awareness of moral values does indeed hold an ambiguous position. On one hand, legal standards are attributed to morals. And on the other hand, it can be carried too far. I'll explain what I mean with an example. It's an incident a friend told me about... ...concerning an examining magistrate. Doctor Hansel, you know there is a charge against you... ...brought by Mrs. Illiana Hofer regarding the abuse of her daughter... ...17 year-old Susanne... ...in accordance with paragraph 174 STGB. That means that you, as a teacher... ...are accused of having unlawful sexual relations with a minor. Furthermore, rape has been alleged. But, Madam Prosecutor, I am innocent! I don't understand why Susanne is trying to frame me. Is it true that Susanne Hofer was your student? Yes. Susanne, can I come with you? I'd like to treat you to a big ice cream sundae. Are you feeling warm, Bert? At this time of year? No, find someone else. But, Susanne... Goodbye. Ah, Susanne. Bert, please excuse us for a moment. I'd like to speak with Susanne. Of course, Doctor. Goodbye, Susanne. Goodbye, Bert. Susanne, I'd like to speak with your mother. You know that your grades are miserable... ...especially in Latin and English. If you think it will help, I'll tell my mother. Goodbye, Doctor. Goodbye, Susanne. So, a few days later, her mother came... ...during my office hours. She asked me to tutor Susanne... ...in Latin and English. I don't know. After all, Susanne is one of my students. I'm not allowed to tutor her. No one will hear about it from us, Doctor. Since my divorce, she's been very muddled... ...and I tell myself it's my fault that she's failing in school now. All right. In the end, I gave in. Then you admit it wasn't right to tutor a student... ...who was also in your class. My God, it's not expressly forbidden! I simply felt sorry for the girl and her mother. I didn't even take any money for it. No money... ...but you tried to reimburse yourself in other ways. That's a lie! Whatever the case, it is the girl's testimony. In the report, it states: On November 27... ...Susanne came to your home that afternoon... ...for the first time, as arranged. Is that correct? Yes. Well, hello. Shall we? Have a seat. First, put those books away. I made us some tea. You like tea, don't you? Yes, very much, Doctor. Shall I pour? Yes, please. Thank you. A real English "tea time". And it tastes even better with a little bit of rum. Okay, but not too much, please. Oh, come on! You'll soon see how much more easily your English flows. You just have to get yourself in the right mood. Sugar? Whew! It's strong! Yes, it loosens the limbs. Oh, leave the books for now. You'll learn English a lot better by practicing. - Yes, but... - No "buts". Do you know your mother is a very smart woman? My mother? Oh, yes. She's also the manager of a fashion boutique. No, that's not what I meant. I meant, because she sent you here. I'll try my best. I hope so. But you're not drinking anything. I feel so tipsy! Susanne? Aren't you a bit warm? And how! Then we can start with the lesson. Are we going to practice English now? Oh yes, we'll do whatever you want. And you'll see, you'll learn plenty! Yes! Soon... What is that? That is your right breast! What is it? That is my right breast! And this... ...your left breast! What is it? That is my... left breast! Listen, Susan... and what is that? That afternoon, you deflowered the girl. But none of that is true! It was just the opposite! She tried to seduce me... ...but I sent her home. Nothing happened. Absolutely nothing! That's what you claim. In any case, the girl came home in a desolate state. That's what her mother testifies. Child, you're drunk! Who got you drunk? - He did. - Who did? It was him, Dr. Hansel. Your teacher gave you alcohol? For Christ's sake! And it wasn't just that. He raped me, that disgusting man, with his big thing! He undressed me and then himself... ...and then he lay on top of me... ...and then he... Oh, mother! It was so terrible! Mrs. Hofer immediately had her daughter examined. The doctor confirmed that the girl was no longer a virgin... ...as well as reporting the presence of sperm in her vagina. That isn't possible. That just isn't possible! All right, I'll add that to the report. It looked bad for Doctor Hansel. I was drafting the indictment... Come in. Hello. Excuse me. I was sent to see you. And what do you want? I'd like to make a statement concerning my teacher, Dr. Hansel... ...before an injustice is done to hime. And you're just coming forward now? Then take a seat, and tell me. Susanne, I like you, and that's why I want to help you with English. I've told you many times. And I've rejected you every time. Try your charm on another girl. I don't understand you. If you fail again on the next test, it's all over for you. Let that be my worry. I've got someone now who's a lot bigger than you. He's tutoring me in Latin and English... ...as well as other things. That was the first time... ...that Susanne mentioned another man to me. I was boiling with jealousy... ...and so I followed her. I had absolutely no idea who this other man might be. That's why I can exactly recall that 27th of November. I was flabbergasted... ...as Susanne suddenly disappeared into Dr. Hansel's house. It couldn't be true! I snuck into the yard and went to the window... ...where I could clearly see into the room. I nearly went mad from excitement. I was so jealous, even though I really had no reason to be. But then I saw Susanne get naked... ...and I couldn't get that image of her out of my mind. A few streets down, I caught up with her. I acted like it was a coincidence that I was there. What are you doing here? You're the last thing I need right now! Get lost! And then, all of a sudden, something strange happened. Hey, Bert? Do you want to fuck me? If you want to fuck me, don't act so stupid! How about it? Can we go to your place? Come on! It happened up in the attic at my home. Neither of us knew what we were doing, but it was wonderful. Oh, you have a sweet pussy! Afterwards, we drank two bottles of Vermouth. And we swore to each other... ...that no one would know what we did. But now I have to tell, right? I can't let our teacher get punished for what we did. And Susanne... I can't understand. Well, this issue will have to be cleared up in juvenile court. The charges against Dr. Hansel were, of course, dropped immediatley. Well, I find it right that the teacher was acquitted. Of course! Morever, the law determined that Susanne wasn't entirely innocent. And the law only protects innocent girls. What does that really mean, "innocent"? It has to do with sexuality. What does that have to do with the law? Well, there are laws governing sexual offenses. Because the government meddles in private affairs... ...that are none of it's business. My classmates always teased me... ...that I was a flower that didn't want to be picked. But somehow, I am different... Inga! Look how you're sitting! Aren't you ashamed in front of your brother? What's going on? Nothing. You both should learn how to sit properly. If that's all, you don't need to yell. I'm just watching TV. Where are you going? To bed... I'm tired. Maybe it's due to a lack of parental understanding... ...that I've become this way. Someone once wrote that prohibition gives birth to sin. On that night, I noticed for the first time... ...that I loved my body. I imagined what a man would do with my body. Yes, touch my nipples. Touch my... Faster! Oh! I can feel you! Come, let's lie down! Come here. Oh, do it! Oh, yes! Shortly thereafter, I met Gitta's older brother, Max. I liked Max as soon as I saw him. I must have made an impression on him, too. I didn't know you had such a nice friend. How could you? You were in the army for two years. Exactly. And now I have a lot of catching up to do. By the way, my friend is throwing a party tonight. Would you like to come? Of course Inga will come. That's obvious! I don't need a guardian, but if you think so, I'll be happy to go. Then come on, let's go! The party was all right. For whatever reason, Gitta didn't come with us. Oh well, it was better for me. I had Max all to myself... ...and I didn't have to worry about his sister. Thanks. What did you think of the party? It was great, really. There were a lot of cool people. And you were the coolest of them all. Thanks. Hey, what's this? This isn't the way home. No, but it's the way to the seventh heaven of love. But this is... ...the most natural thing in the world. You like me, and I like you. So, why not? It's about time that we got closer together. Or do you think I had the reclining seat installed just for fun? What did my buddy in the army always say? Get her while she's young. That was the moment I'd been waiting for the whole night. But strangely, as it was about to happen... ...along with the desire I felt... ...I also had a vague feeling of anxiety. Yes, come. Come into me! But please be careful. It's my first time. What? Say that again. You've never done it before? You're still a virgin? Yes. Then we'd better stop. This isn't my thing. But Max, I want to! No, it's better that we don't. I want to have fun, but I don't want to break you in. You'll have to find someone else for that. Get dressed. You're mean! Should I drive you home, or can you find your way? The experience with Max was enough for me. Now I really wanted to know. Anyone who wasn't afraid to deflower a virgin was fine by me. I picked up a guy in a disco who was willing to do me. Get dressed. I'm done. That's it? Just a day after the flop with Max, I was no longer a virgin. And that was it. The great experience I was yearning for... ...well, that wasn't it. I had even worse disappointments with young beginners... ...than I did with those who had experience with fucking. What's wrong with you? I don't feel anything! I don't know. I don't know. It's just not working. It always has, but not now. Come on, already! Come on! It's not working! I don't know what would have become of me... ...if I hadn't met Freddie after all those unsatisfactory experiences. Freddie, had everything that... ...up to now, I'd searched for in vain. The strength and sensuality that I needed. I was very happy. You're finally going to get what you really need. Come on, give it to her! Finish her! Come on, doll. Freddie, help me! I'm sick of fucking you all the time! I can't stand you anymore! Get going! Freddie! Please help me, Freddie! Come on. That's enough for now. I don't remember how I got out of Freddie's place. I just got on a bus ... got away! I was finished. So finished that I had but one thought. It had to stop! I was so messed up that I saw no point in living. Can I be of help? Men are pigs! You may be right, but perhaps I can still help you. Leave me alone. That's out of the question. If you've already had such bad experiences with men... ...then it's time for someone to convince you otherwise. Where do you live? In town... Then how did you get out here? Problems? Well, for every problem there's a solution. You just have to be willing to give it an honest try. Come on. I'll take you back to town. His name was Rolf. He was a student. He let me experience... ...that love isn't just sexual gratification at any cost. But rather, when the body and mind are together... ...love will unite two people... forever. I'll tell you my story myself. My name is Kathy Dietz. I'm 17 years old... ...and a sophomore at the technical high school. It started with a harmless party. It was boring. Nothing was going on. It's too damned hot. I need to get a drink. What's wrong with you? Why are you so cold? - Don't talk nonsense! - But it's true. You're acting like a frigid virgin. Why? My God! I just don't feel like it right now. You don't need to get all crazy because of that. What a shitty party! Hey... Allow me to help. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Say... who's the hot babe? - My mother. - What? My stepmother. Wow! Your old man has good taste. And you obviously don't. Come on, I didn't mean it that way. You don't think I'm hot for your stepmother, do you? You're capable of anything. But she's too old for me. That may be true, but it wouldn't really bother you. Come on, Kathy. I care only for you. You must believe me. So... do you want to sleep with me? The questions you ask. Of course I would! Are you going wild for it? Incredibly! - And would you do anything for it? - Of course. What? Well... to earn it, so to speak. Certainly. I mean, it would depend, of course. It would even be fun for you. Now I'm really curious. It's simple. - Just fuck my stepmother. - What? - You have to fuck her. - And then... ? Then I'll sleep with you. I promise. And how should I accomplish that with your stepmother? You're so naive! It's quite simple. For example, do the following... Hello, stepmother. Have you been out spending money again? Oh, another new outfit! You have so few, right? Hello? - Is this Mrs. Dietz? - Yes. You don't know me. I'm calling about your stepdaughter. What is this about? She's been involved in some things... ...that you and your husband wouldn't approve of. Listen, how dare you, a stranger, say such things? No... I don't mean to impose. If you don't care what your child is doing... ...then let's forget it. I didn't mean it that way. When and where? - Tomorrow at 3:00, Cafe Krone. - Okay. A new admirer? The main thing is that you don't forget the pill. Oh, it's you. May I? By the way, my name is Frank. That's very nice of you, but the mysterious invitation and these flowers... ...don't seem to go together. Yes, they do. You may be thinking of a different circumstance. But everything is fine with your stepdaughter. I just used her as a way to get to know you. You know, I ought to slap your face in front of all these people. But to tell the truth, you amuse me. - And you seem to be a nice boy. - Thank you. - Hello, Kathy. - Hi, Frank. Go on, tell me! How did the rest play out? Splendid, of course. At first, there was a little anger, understandably... ...but I played being lovesick so convincingly... ...that she went all soft. As soft as butter. And then? What else? We have a date for tomorrow afternoon. Terrific! At the location we agreed on? - Exactly. - Oh Frank, you're the best! Goodbye then, and keep me informed! Just a moment, my Kathy. How about a little advance, eh? No! Please don't! Why not? You need to save your energy for my beloved stepmother. Don't be a chicken. Come on. Why should we wait? First, you have to fuck my stepmother like we agreed. Okay? Tell me, why are you actually doing all of this? Why is it necessary that I sleep with your stepmother? Because Angelika is taking my father to the cleaners... ...and I want to prove to him that she's a bitch! Where's your stepmother, Angelika? I have no idea. She doesn't share her sweet little secrets with me. Does she have secrets? All women have secrets. Do you think it's good to leave... ...such a beautiful, young woman alone as often as you do? That's a pretty dress. Hello, Angelika. No. Come. Come! Come... Thank you. That's enough. With those photos, it was now no longer a problem... ...to finally get rid of my so-called stepmother, the stupid cow. They were divorced, as I'd planned... ...and I soon had my father all to myself again. I thought everything was fine now. What's wrong? Why are you in such a hurry? Sorry, but I want you to leave now. It's nice that you kept your promise. What? You want me to leave? Yeah... I have company coming over. Company? Today? Just by coincidence, an old friend of yours. Your former stepmother. What? I actually found her to be a most charming woman. The real bitch, my dear Kathy, is you. Say that again! Get dressed and get lost. I don't want to see you again. By the way, she's infinitely better than you in bed. You still have a lot to learn. Bastard! Leave! Right now!! Oh, I'll show you! Stop! Cheers, Kathy. What's wrong? By the way, I meant to tell you, I got engaged again. What? Well... yes. I wanted to introduce her to you today. You'll like her. I'm sure you will. There she is now. Kathy, please be nice to her. Make an effort, for my sake. Will you promise me? Good evening. Please, come in. Kathy, this is Paula, my fiancee. - Hello, Kathy. - It's you, Paula? What? Why? Do you know each other? Of course. Paula's in my class. She sits next to me. And with that, my troubles began all over again. Now I'm wondering if it even makes sense... ...to turn my father against Paula. Otherwise, he'll surprise me with a kindergartner next. You see, there are many situations in life... ...which one might morally condemn... ...that aren't covered by our laws. Of course no one can be judged by the courts due to a lack of character... ...unfortunately. Often, what is initially thought to be worthy of condemnation... ...whether morally or legally... ...can seem quite different when you learn the actual circumstances. So you're correct, Iris. And some things that seem worthy of condemnation... ...are simply unusual, upon closer examination. So, where is our sunny country girl today? Does anyone know if Selfie is sick? Maybe she missed the bus. She lives so far out. Oh, yes. Selfie wasn't sick. Her absence was due to other reasons, as I later found out. What's wrong, Selfie? Your hands are cold... ...and what if someone comes? There's no one around. Hey, neighbor. Let me by, and then you can keep groping each other. I have to catch my bus. Oh Christ! My bus! Damned bus! Can't we be together one time without someone bothering us? Or without freezing our asses off? I'd like that so much, Karli, but it's not possible. My mother carefully monitors my schedule. How long school lasts. How long the bus takes. My God, what can I do? And I can't sleep at night because I'm thinking of you. What we need is a place of our own. And how would you pay for it? Shit! There's the bus! Damned bus! Can't you take the next one? Then I'll be late to school! That doesn't matter. - Goodbye! - Bye! - See you! - Yeah... Getting anywhere with your girl? Some... but her mother watches her too closely. If the two of us had a comfortable place to stay, it'd be a done deal! What are you reading? This is a good book - quite exciting. It's really scary! Scary? Nothing frightens me. I'll bet it would scare you! Yeah! It would scare me just to read a book! Don't talk nonsense. This is really creepy. You can borrow it! What's it called? "The Exorcist" "The Exorcist"? But don't wear out the book. Isn't this the book they made into a film? You know what, boss? I'll read this. There you go! Oh, Karli! Where will we finally do it? Not here, and not there. Not there, and not here. Where, then? Oh, Karli. Karli. It would be so nice if you were here. In bed with me. The two of us alone. Lying close together. Very close together. Very tight! Oh, it would be so nice, Karli. Karli! Karli! Karli... Do you understand the plan? I'm not sure. You'll be possessed by the devil, and I'll show up as Rasputin. There! I wrote it all down for you on that paper. Are you unwell, miss? Me? Why do you ask? Because you're going like this... I went like... ...that? Yes, you most certainly did. I'm sure. Don't make me laugh. You saw it too, neighbor. She did this... She's contagious! Hello, Selfie! Fuck me! Kiss my ass! Is that you, Selfie? Jesus, Selfie! What's wrong with you, child? This pussy belongs to me, and it's on fire! Are you sick, girl? Should I call the doctor? No! Call the fire department! My pussy is burning! My pussy is burning! What's wrong with the girl? What the hell? Why are you throwing the dumplings... ...and screaming like a sow? What's wrong with the girl? Has she gone mad? I'd like to know, too. Come on, fuck me! Fuck me hard! Yes... I'm a mare! Where's my stallion? What? What are you doing? Are you stupid, Uncle Alois? You see? It helped. For God's sake! What's wrong? Why are you looking at me like that? Child, what happened to you? What's all this? Well, we'd like to know, too! Don't you know anything? - Me? - What? Come along, Selfie, lie down in your room. I'll bring you something to eat later. What's going on? Tell me, Sepp, has she gone mad? Certainly. Most certainly. Oh my God, I think Selfie is possessed by the Devil. What devil? She told me I should fu... ...fu... ...fuck her! Hallelujah! Whoever touches the girl, I'm telling you now... ...I'll crack open his skull. What's going on? The girl is crazy. I don't know. I'm going to the tavern. You know what? I'll go with you. Let's both go. Just for a little while. But... My poor child! Look at that. May I sit... ...at this table? Please, go ahead. Have a seat, sir. Thank you. What can I get you? A glass of milk, please. Milk? What do you want? A liter of milk? A glass... of buttermilk. So, who are you? I am Horace, protector of the good. And you drink milk? Milk strengthens my divine mental powers. It is a mild refreshment for the persecuted and stricken. Are you a lunatic? Certainly not, dear sir. It's from milk that I draw my power to exorcise evil spirits. - An exorcist? - Yes. - Did you hear that? - Yeah, yeah. So... how much do you charge to perform an exorcism? For an exorcism? That depends on the severity of the case... ...and, of course, whatever you can afford. What do you think? Yes... but we can't afford much. - Should we do it? - Indeed! I have a case for you! Are you possessed? No, no. I'm not possessed! - It's a woman. - A maiden. She's young. And a virgin. Exorcising a demon is a fight between life and death. But it's agreed. I'll do it. Do you want... ? There you go. Do you want an advance? Is 100 enough? Are you trying to insult me? I do this only because of the cause. - You see? - Good. You don't need any devices? I mean, images of saints or something? Some incense. And candles. No. I'll do it all... ...with only my own powers, bestowed upon me by nature. Okay, if you say so. Now, take me to the girl, my dear woman. Yes, yes, yes. Come with me. Please! It appears to be a typical case of possession. Now, please leave me alone with the subject. Otherwise the demon will take possession of your bodies... ...when it escapes the girl's body! Will it take long? It's impossible to say with any certainty, but it will take a while. You people must leave now! Go! Yes, okay. We're going. How did I do? More demonic! I cast you out! Depart, Satan! You have to howl! I think it's beginning to work. Anyone who knows how to do is welcome to it. I feel a little queasy. I need something to drink. Go and get a bottle of Gentian, Sepp. Okay, I'll get it. Return to your birthplace! Fuck me! Fuck me at last! What happened? That stung! What was it... the Devil? Did it work? You're a genius, Karli! Beelzebub! For the last time, leave this innocent virgin! Depart from her and let the good spirit enter her! Here's the devil with his long tail. - Here's the Gentian. - Good. He can do it! He really knows how to drive the devil from a girl. Yes! - May I? - Sure. Well... if I didn't know he was exorcising the devil... ...then I'd say he's fucking her. - Sepp! Don't speak of sin. - No. Yes! Yes! What's going on? Nothing's happening. Move! Let me! Come! Are you finished, Mr. Exorcist? Patience! Wait! Where is she? A moment, dear folks. Is it done, yet? Patience, dear sir. The devil is not yet defeated. But soon! Good spirit... What that poor girl has had to endure! It's time for the devil to leave her. It can't go on like this much longer. It's terrible! Yes! Satan's tail is about to leave you... Leave it in. In! In. In. - Out! - In! - In! In! - Out! Out! - In! - Out! Is something wrong, Mr. Exorcist? Does the poor girl still have to suffer? The devil is out of her... at last! Here's your niece. She is forever free of the devil. Is that true, dear? Believe me, I haven't felt this good in a long time! It was a difficult struggle... ...but we eventually finished the job. In that case... here's your pay. It must have been exhausting. Yes, it was. It sucks the energy out of you! But I did it with passion and love. So, until next time. Goodbye. Just a minute! That's no exorcist! He just came to fuck the girl! Do you hear me? Never come near this house again! You'll get what's coming to you, Exorcist! When I catch you... ...I'll beat your backside! Oh well, God punishes our little sins right away. That's just how it is. Rules are bypassed or broken in every society. As humans, we're all different Otherwise, it'd be boring! That all sounds very nice... ...but if someone makes sure that it doesn't become boring... ...that person will be immediately punished or socially ostracized. Especially a woman. Yes, that's right. There's still no equality. But that's how it is. When a girl acts differently than expected... ...everyone gossips. You must be speaking from experience, Iris. Maybe. Iris. Iris, what would you say to a nice, strong coffee? I'm nearly finished. Iris, my golden angel. I'll be right there! Is this all right? You know my taste. Enchanting. Very enchanting. Really enchanting. Oh, it's time for me to go, darling. I have a meeting at 4:00. I wish I could stay with you. It's not possible. I have to go, too -- home. - Home? - Yeah. This is your home. All this belongs to you, my love. I can hardly believe it. You're too generous, Walter. Not generous, just grateful. When one is my age... ...one is grateful to have someone like you. By the way, I have tickets for the opera on Friday night. - La Boheme with Freni. - Lovely. - Are you happy? - Yes! You need to think about your meeting! That damned meeting. Every time I left the apartment Walter had given me... ...to go back to my parents'... ...I felt like my own double. No one knew about my love for Walter or my apartment. Is that you, child? Yes, mother. Your dinner is nearly cold. Where have you been so long? Babysitting, mother. I told you. Here, mother. For you. A hundred? Babysitting pays that well? It includes an advance. I have to sit all night on Friday. It would be better if you got a respectable job, instead. Leave the child alone. She's still in school. She still has to learn. Nonsense! At 14 I was already earning money. And your mother was a waitress at 15. And that's why we have such a small pension now. This isn't not my fault. It's what I inherited from Adolf. Let me through. What do you want with education? High school, university and then a doctorate, too? You'll be 30 when you're done, and then you'll be unemployed. I know the way it is with academics -- what crap! Do you have to start drinking so soon in the day, Fritz? Let him be, mother. You see? At least she has a heart for her father. Child, listen to me. Forget about education and get a decent job. The way you're built, you'll make a lot in tips. So that you can drink them away? Just leave the child alone. She has the drive to be something better. She had to be named Iris because that's what you wanted. I would have named her Emma. - You see? - See what? I'm right. On Friday night, after the opera, we went to dinner. That was really pleasant. Did you enjoy your meal? - It was an enjoyable evening, wasn't it? - Yes. Hopefully we aren't too late. I've been looking forward to a decent fondue all day. Look, Franzl. Isn't that your uncle? Indeed. Yes, that's my uncle. And with a young hottie! I have to say, the managing director has good taste. If Adelheid knew... My relationship with Walter Harden... ...the managing director of a chemical company... ...married, no children... ...had already gone on for several months now. He gave me everything I needed -- ...an apartment, clothes, books, money. I almost think I could love him. I'm Mrs. Harden, Walter's wife. Forgive me for coming here unannounced. How did you get in? With this key. How did you get it? That... doesn't matter. Please, madam, have a seat. You can take it from me, I'm not your friend. Please, no sentimentality, madam. That won't work on me. Don't worry, I'm not sentimental. Just logical. The three of us are stuck in an impasse... ...and so we must find a way out. You want me to end it with Walter. You want him back. I don't want him back. I never lost him. Are you so sure? My husband spoke with me. You can keep all this. He asked me to give you his key. Men always turn out to be cowards, don't they? Thank you. What do you want from me? Who are you? Harden. Franz Harden. Director Harden is my uncle. What do you want? To get to know you. I fear you've gotten your hopes up for nothing. But please, come with me. With pleasure. Would you care for something to drink? - Gladly. - Cognac or whiskey? Cognac. May I? My uncle's stuff is always especially good. You could have spared me that remark. - Yes. - It's over. I know. And so you think you can be next. That's up to you. You were in the restaurant the other evening. Yes. You looked wonderful! Oh, no! If you think I would have told on my uncle... ...I'd never do that. Discretion is a matter of honor, right? To tell you the truth, my aunt already knew for some time. - Is that so? - Yes. Oh, look here. "The Divine Comedy." My uncle loved this edition. Have you read Dante? - And in the original as well? - You have something against that? Why would I? I'm used to being underestimated. So, what are you waiting for? Well, isn't this what you wanted? To want nothing from you... ...would be an insult. You're lucky I like you. Yes... come! Yes. That's nice... So let me treat you to a terrific meal. No. I'd like to invite you to dinner. It's a tremendous honor to have you visit us, Doctor. Excuse me. A war injury. What kind of doctor are you? I'm a chemist. That's good. Yes! And he has a good chance of becoming the next director. His uncle will take care of him. I can take care of myself. And you know, that is good. A man should be able to do that if he ever wants to start a family. Forget about marriage. The Mark will be worth nothing when there's children running around. How can you say such a thing, Fritz? The doctor probably has a different opinion. Right, Doctor? Can I get you anything else? Really, no. No thank you. You don't always have to insist, mother. You can see that the Doctor has had quite enough. Excuse me. It's an old war injury. If you wanted to scare me away with that invitation... ...then you've succeeded. Yes, I wanted you to find out. Did you introduce my uncle to your parents? No. Then why me? Think about it. The hell I will. You're a strange girl. I can't figure you out. Will we see each other again? No, I don't think so. Goodbye. Just a minute, ladies. We got a little off track from the subject... ...but the question of government, jurisdiction and privacy... ...is an important one. Ultimately, this is an issue that affects all of us. So, goodbye until next time. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Are you coming over later? - When? - At 6:00. No, that's too late for me. Okay, then let's do it at 5:00. Hey, is someone trying to get our attention? Which of us is he waving at? Wait here. It's for me. I'll be right back. That's a nice car! And a good-looking guy! Bang! A home run! I've been thinking about you and me. I understand that your parents are a part of who you are... ...and you wanted to show me that. - You're very smart. - Thanks for nothing! In another time, you certainly would have made a great hetaera... ...or courtesan, but today... But today, such a girl goes to school, and then on to university... ...and then one day she'll earn her doctorate. So, what does one do with such a person these days? You can see yourself marrying such a person. Say that again! Marriage. No, it doesn't have to be right away. That would be nice. But first, I want to... ...finish school and go to university. And you should. So, what do you think? Do you agree? At some point I'll need a wife who can feed me later in life. Schoolgirls -- often berated, rarely praised... ...and mostly misunderstood. Young people in a new age... ...with the untamed urge for freedom and life. Only he who was never young has the right to condemn them. Better yet to help them in their self-realization... ...and the right to live their own lives.
