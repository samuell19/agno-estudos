Incident Command, this is Redding 5 approaching a timber fire off Route 16. We've got a high rate of spread on this one, with a line of cars that are blocking emergency vehicles, so we're gonna send in the jumpers on the left flank. Approaching drop zone now. Honey, it's really bad. I don't know when... We're trapped. We can't get out. What do we do now? We need a miracle. - Where? Oh! - Look! Where's my Redding Crew at? Everywhere! Road's backed up for miles and we need to get emergency teams in here. But right now our job is to keep that fire from those vehicles. Alpha Team, cut a line upslope and prep for a burn. Yes, sir! Beta Team, stay close to me. Love being close to you, Supe. In the words of Stormin' Norman Schwarzkopf, "If you can't take the heat, get out the kitchen!" Not even close. Let's disagree to agree, 'cause quotes are my thing. Oh! Fire's gonna do a 180 off the line! Supe! Laser! Alpha Team! Move! Move! It's getting real warm down here. Got me? Roger that. Two... One... Paint it pink! Whoo! I love the smell of PHOS-CHEK in the morning! Whoa! Whoa, whoa, you okay? I'm good. I'm good. Thank you for... You are the bravest man I've ever seen. - And the hottest. - Thank you, ma'am. But for us, it's just another day at the office. My husband sells insurance! Take me with you! I'm literally standing right here. Hey, hey, hey, guys! My dawgs, come on, come on. You crushed it out there, men. You crushed it! Man, I am so sorry, Supe. The guys were just blowing off steam. I apologize. There will be time for steam reallocation later. Our main priority is to get this depot tip-top. Gentlemen, you know how quickly things can go sideways. Heck, my dad was the greatest smokejumper ever to hang boots in this depot. Oh. Mmm, I don't know. Now I got it. Sliver! That is... That is in there. Gentlemen, we must be at our very best... ...every second of every day! Exactly. Now, where's my Redding Crew at? Everywhere! - Commander Richards. - Mmm. The way you and your men put out that fire today, it felt like it was really the work of superheroes. "Superheroes"? That's the Santa Barbara fire! No. We're just men with a lot a training, very strict exercise regimens, and first-class genetics. Now that I say it out loud, I guess we are superheroes. After a storied career as Division Commander, rumor has it you're considering retirement. - Care to comment? - The rumors are true. You should be the next Division Commander. You've been training for this since you were saving LEGO people from LEGO fires. It's what my dad and I always dreamed of. ...the ability to put a fire out. Commander Richards, are you afraid of anything? Uh, Supe? No, I'm not afraid of anything. Except for mice. They're a little creepy. - Supe. - What? Sorry, Supe. We're gonna join the Santa Barbara crew. We just want to be in the big leagues. What... You are so in the big leagues! Were you not in that fire? I just singed my eyebrows! Smell my beard, it smells like a luau. That was disturbing. Axe, you coming with us? Ha! Ha! Go! Go! Go, get out of here! Get out of here, you backstabbers. If you had a fraternity, I wouldn't even join it! Can you even step? Huh? We don't need you! We... don't... need... you! We need them. We need them, Chief. We just lost three of our best jumpers and our pilot. Come on, man. What's the backup plan? We're gonna do what we always do. Tidy up the depot? We stay vigilant. Rely on our training. Although, that's gonna mean that... I'm gonna have to fly. I don't know if I'm ready for that, I mean... I was much more comfortable being the backup pilot. I'm really not suited for a leadership role, - right at this moment. - Congratulations. You've been called up. But, Supe... Oh, man. Fire down by the lake. Relax, guys. Relax. They don't even need us. Local team says there's this massive storm coming here, and it's just gonna... Let it burn out. So there's no need to be nervous, or... Just relax, stay cool. Lieutenant, there's cabins down by that lake. I'm looking for the best of the best. Someone who knows what a fire's gonna do before it does it. If you're worried about it, we could just go down there and check it out, right? Whoever takes over the position is going to be almost as great as me. We need eyes on the ground. Call Dr. Hicks! Didn't you guys go on a few dates? Dates? No. There were two or three occurrences where we sat together for chow. - Oh, so, dates. - We're professionals. I decided that our spending time together - was taking me away from this. - Supe... - So I chose to press pause. - In the middle of our date? Dr. Hicks! What's the problem, Superintendent Carson? Why do you assume there's a problem? Unless you're calling three months later to apologize for going to the bathroom during our dinner and never coming back. Oh, no, she didn't. I am sorry. I will go over here. Okay, there's a problem. I need you to bring up your cameras. There's a fire down by the lake. There. Zoom in on that cabin. Right there. Oh, no. Oh, I see it. I see that the... With a storm coming in, there is no way the local depot is gonna make it. Get the chopper ready. - Where's my Redding Crew at? - Everywhere! Everywhere. Chopper flies in five. Oh, look, we're off the ground. So far, so good. All right. Deploying the Bambi... Now. Carson! All right, heads up, guys. Confirming fire structure. Three thousand pounds of water coming at you. Dropping the water... Now! Okay, uh, nice try. Can you try being a little more supportive? I haven't flown in a while, okay? Supe, you want me to double back to the lake? No, ditch the bucket. Give me a line. - Good? - You're good. Hold her steady! You're ten feet from there. Proceeding with room check. Clear! I love you. - Bunny! - I will get you another one. - Bunny. - Zoey... I got three civilians in the bravo side of the structure. - You hurt? - Are you really a fireman? I'm a smokejumper, which is like a firefighter, but way cooler. What does a smokejumper do? We jump into fires to fight them. Firemen fight fires. Yeah, but there's over a million firefighters, there's only 336 smokejumpers. A million's more than 300. In this case, less is more. Listen, stop! I don't have time. - Where are your parents? - They're not here. I can't get ahold of them. Okay, fine. I'm getting you out, one by one. - You first. Let's go. - Take Will first. No. Take Zoey, then Brynn, then me. No. Zoey, then you, then me. No. No, we do what I say and we do it now! Copy that. We're a go for extraction. No. Wait... Wait! Stop! - Wait! - The button, it's jammed. Release! Stop! Ooh. This must be why there are so few smokejumpers. All right. Let's try this again. Come on, come on, come on. - Oh, no! - Whoa! I'm gonna clip us all together, and we all go at once. Okay? Bunny! Go now! - "Now," now? - Yes, he said now! Well, he said "now" before! What if he changes his mind again? - He's not gonna change his mind! - Hey, guys, focus! Now! It's the Channel Six news team! Folks, we are witnessing a live aerial rescue. Take the children to St. Stephen's for medical eval. - Copy that. - But why? We're fine. Protocol. Hey, Supe. Storm's on top of us. Winds are at 20 knots. I need to set down, now! Fine. Head back to the depot. We'll evaluate 'em there. What the heck are three eight-year-olds doing alone in the middle of nowhere? Eight? I'm not eight. Hey! If he says you're eight, you're eight. Where's the pole? Can I slide down the pole? - Depot's one floor. No pole. - Do you have a hook and ladder? Hook and ladder? No. What kind of firefighter are you? I told you. I'm a smokejumper, which, again, is way better. Where are your parents? They went up the coast for a night for their 20th anniversary. And I'm extremely responsible. I've kept these two out of trouble their entire lives. - Hey! - Whoo! Yeah, I can see that. Put that down. No shenanigans on my watch! Yeah, no monkeyshines, tomfoolery, or hijinks. You finished? As long as there's not a hint of malarkey. Whoa! Now, if I didn't know any better, I would say that that was sarcasm. So why don't we just take it down a notch, sister, okay? Maybe a little gratitude would be helpful. Sorry, bud, we just don't speak oldsey-timesy. Oh, my gosh. But she's not stopping. It's just... That's just sarcasm, right? I mean, that's not just me, right? - It's just sarcasm. - No, it's not just you. I just... - I felt it now, little miss. - Wow! Gentlemen. I got this. My name isn't "bud" or "man" or "dude." It is Superintendent Jake Carson. But you can call me that. The whole thing. This is Captain Mark Rogers. Lieutenant Rodrigo Torres. And that is Axe. Hi, Axe. Does he always carry that axe? Yeah, 'cause he's always ready to roll. All right, all right. What's your mom's number? You can't just cold call my mom. What do you think she's gonna do when she sees the caller ID from a fire station and finds out her cabin burned down? - I'll call her. - Fine. Set it up, and you hand it right over to me. It's straight to voicemail. Hey, Mom, please don't worry. We're all totally fine... But I'm so sorry to tell you that the cabin burned down. We were rescued by these smokejumpers, which I've heard are actually way cooler than firemen. Apparently, there's only 339 of them in the entire country. Three hundred thirty-six. And this, when you do that... That's not helpful. So, we couldn't be in safer hands. I guess you can take your time. No! No, no. Hello, ma'am. Uh... Hello, ma'am. - Hello, ma'am? - It's still a voicemail. This is Superintendent Jake Carson of Redding Depot, Region Five. I have your children. They are physically unharmed, but I must say they are a bit of a handful. Please call me back ASAP to make arrangements to come pick them up. Thank you. Have a... Have a great rest of the day. That doesn't make any sense, unless... Oh, yeah... Lieutenant, how bad's the storm? Well, in the words of Mahatma Gandhi, "It's bad. Real, real bad." Nope. Not even one thing about that was right. Why you got to go and blow up my spot like that? I wouldn't... Can we make it to the police station? Chief, it's 90 miles. The roads are all flooded. You don't want to take the kids out in that. What about the Safe Haven Law? As first responders, we're legally bound for the health and welfare of the children until they're relinquished to a legal guardian. Of course. I know what the Safe Haven Law is. Well, see? See, it's a good thing the Alpha Team quit 'cause now we got all this spare room for the kids to sleep in. Huh? Yeah. Lucky us. Let's do this. Hey, guys! This hose can reach... Attention, everyone... Man down. I'm coming, Supe! Whoa! This depot is not a playground! "Got your message. Thank you. "There is really spotty service here. "We're stuck due to the storm, "but we will set out first thing in the morning. "Thank you again from the bottom of our hearts." That was a message from your mom. Mama! No hugs. I'm legally bound to take care of you, so that's what I'm gonna do. In turn, you're gonna ditch the attitude and be obedient, so we can do our job. Fighting fires. Why does it have to be "fighting" the fires? Can't it just be "containing" it or "resolving" it? Oh, my gosh! For crying out loud. I can no longer hold my tongue. So what needs to happen right now, like literally, this second, is you gotta watch your tone, little sister. Or what? "Or what?" "Or what?" Hot! "Or what?" "Or what?" Por que? I'm... Oh, I know what. Oh, Masher! No! No! Sit. Good doggy. What... What just happened? I think the baby broke your dog. Sparkle Pony. Her name's Masher. - Sparkle Pony. - Her name is Masher. Sparkle Pony! Okay... - Can you pass me the remote? - Hey. That's Supe's chair. Uh-uh, what? No, no, no, that's mine. - Good. - "Good"? What? This is the most amazing chair ever! That is not for children. - A chair isn't for children? - Nothing here is for children. Listen, Jake, it's been a long day. Why don't you just point me to the kitchen? I'll make 'em some dinner, and we'll stay out of your hair. Wait a minute, if there's gonna be any cooking done around here, it's gonna be done by moi. That's French for "chef," by the way. No, it's not. No, it's a great idea. Lieutenant, show her the kitchen. Rest of the depot's off-limits, are we clear? Crystal. Don't you touch that button. Don't you touch the... Don't you do it. Don't press it. I pressed it. Stupid Safe Haven Law. Redding Depot. Superintendent Jake Carson speaking. Hey, Supe, just checking to make sure you're okay. You look worse than you did after we spent nine days fighting the Gaucho fire. I'm fine. Are you sure? 'Cause you always tap your fingers like that when you're upset. Hi. There was just a couple other things I wanted to say about the fact that... Okay, call me again, and I promise I will come out there... Excuse me? What kind of way is that to answer a phone at a federal fire facility? Tell Superintendent Carson I need to speak to him immediately. Tell him it's Commander Bill Richards. Please hold. Superintendent Jake Carson speaking. How can I help you, Commander? I was working a Class F in southern Idaho, and someone forwards me a video of one of my smokejumpers being pulled into a Huey. Sir, about that... I apologize. For what? Being in beast mode on national television? Great optics for the department, Carson. All in a day's work, sir. I understand you're Dan Carson's boy. He was a world-class smokejumper. Died in that blaze in Yosemite, as I recall. No greater honor for a smokejumper than burning to a crisp. Would've preferred he didn't die, sir. As you're aware, I have to pick my successor. Mandatory retirement. But after last night's heroics, you've made my short list for Division Commander. That's fantastic, sir! I... It would be my privilege to carry on your legacy after you're gone. Say what? "Gone"? I'm not dying. I'm never dying. And if I do die, that's because everybody else is dead, too. But yes, uh, what I meant was when you retire. Slow your roll, cowboy! It's not your job yet. I'm sure you wouldn't mind me coming down there Monday morning and seeing how you run your shop. It'd be my honor, sir. I'll have my office e-mail the application. Make it official. I'll see you Monday. Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah! - Where did you come from? - Supe... This is huge! You are going to have every single depot under your command. Nothing's official yet. Big Dan would be so proud. Oh! No. Oh. I have to fill out the most important application of my life. Yes, sir! You kidding me? Hey. What are you guys doing in here? Admiring your shelving. Okay, well, anything in here is outdated and unfit for use. You mean like your fanny pack? This is a FUPA. Did you just say "FUPA"? "Fire Utility Pouch Apparatus." Yes. I did. Come on, don't play that. - Sheez. - Is this yours? This was my dad's. Used to play this thing all the time. - Man, he loved it. - Play! Pianos are not for playing. I got work to do. Please stop crying! Why are you just standing there? I've seen you wrestle a wolverine! - What is going on out here? - I don't know! She's broken! I tried everything. I mean, the thing she's doing... She's doing that! Problem? "Problem"? That. That's my problem. Make that stop. Zoey, you're okay, huh? It's okay. Maybe don't come at her all aggro next time. "Me fireman. Can't turn my neck." No. That was a good impression. Hey, guys! I found these cool Nerf guns! Reach for the sky, cowboy. - Those aren't Nerf guns! - Put it down! Put it down! Whoa! Ooh! Ha! You missed me! Crisis averted. I never imagined I'd have to tell a smokejumper this, but you know the correct way to use a fire extinguisher is you point the action end away from you, right? Dr. Hicks. What's your problem? Why do you think there's a problem? You always blink really fast when you're angry. I'm not blinking fast. But there is a problem. You dive-bombed my lab and scooped up water from Fisher Lake. That is a protected wildlife area. That kind of activity is devastating to the habitat of the Western Spadefoot! Forgive me if I'm prioritizing human life over a frog pond. - They're toads. - It's the same thing. Like firemen and smokejumpers? I have an agreement with Cal Fire saying that they are not gonna collect water from Fisher Lake for their dumps. And now it looks like you are gonna have to sign it, too. You know what? You're right. You're right, and I'm sorry. You are? - I admire what you do out there. - You do? You're so nurturing towards those frog... Toads. It's almost maternal. Wait, what's happening right now? Nothing. I'm just saying that caring for living creatures - is no small task. - Exactly. - Yeah. - Yeah. Dr. Hicks, have you ever felt a void in your life that could be filled by one to three small children? Wait, what? I just need your help with a big problem that I have. Them. Why is Pinkie Pie so mad at Rainbow Dash? She found out that Rainbow Dash was secretly throwing away Pinkie's pies. It was so shady and unponyish, I don't even want to go into it. How do you know that? In San Quentin, they only let you watch three shows. Cooking, history, and kids. So now I'm an expert in all three. Well, it all makes sense now. - Right? - What's San Quentin? It's a liberal arts college in Vermont. Wait. This was much worse a minute ago. Well, it seems like you've got it under control now. So if you could just sign that contract, then I can leave and you can continue watching My Little Pony with your friends. You don't understand. I am stuck with these kids overnight. I was hoping that maybe you would know how to take care of them. Because... Because I am a woman? No... No! No. No! You're a scientist who knows how to care for living creatures. So it's my scientific opinion you're looking for. - Yes! - Well, in my scientific opinion, you're a terrible liar. Pants on fire. Come on! I have devoted half of my life to my career. I am a well-respected field scientist! I am not some pushover that you can get to babysit for you! If you can survive in the epicenter of a raging wildfire for days on end, you can handle a few kids for one night. It's pouring rain out. Get inside! Hey. What were you doing out there? I saw the door open. I just was wondering where you were. I appreciate the concern. The outside, off-limits. - That your girlfriend? - No. She's an angry scientist I thought I could unload you on. - But you like her. - No, I don't. - She definitely likes you. - No, she doesn't. Wait... She does? Who cares? What? See? You do like her. - Do you love her? - Kisses! - Ooh! - Not funny! - I'm sorry. - It is not funny. All right, bedtime! Pick a bed. I forgot my jammers. Is that Dr. Hicks? Oh, sorry. That's mine. - Cool. - Oh, yeah, that's mine, too. - What's that? - Um... Oh, that's not mine. It's not mine. But I'll take it. We've recently had a few vacancies, so you can quietly stay here until the morning. Your concern for us is really touching, Jake. Superintendent Jake Carson. Alexa, play BTS. Alexa, play BTS. - What are you doing? - Your Alexa's broken. That's a clock. Go to bed. I don't want to see any of you until 0600. We're not in the military. Don't you remember what it's like to be a kid? Of course I do. That corner over there is where I did my first one-handed pushup. Learned to fold my dad's parachute in that bunk right there. Christmas intermittent fasting. Sprints till exhaustion. Speculating on banana futures. I've been training here since I was four years old. - Why does she keep doing that? - I don't know. Babies cry. I didn't cry. I never cried. - You've never cried? - No. And you're proud of it? I get sad... I just don't show my emotions with water dripping out of my eyes and making... Somebody quiet her down, for Pete's sake! Lullaby! Lullaby! It's weird. She usually only likes lullabies from our dad. Lullaby! Lullaby! It'll work a lot better if you do it. - Lullaby! Lullaby! - Okay! Uh, this... Lullaby, uh... I'm trying to think of one... Nope. No. There once was a man from Nantucket. He... That's a limerick. That's not a lullaby. I'm not gonna use that. There's got to be one up there. I got nothing. Yep. Mission accomplished. Good night. Who cares? We went on a couple of dates, and honestly, all he did was talk about fire, fire, fire, and smoke and jumping and blah, blah, blah. I mean, whatever. I'm over it. Why do I, Jake Carson, deserve to be Division Commander? He's gross. Unless you're into sort of a tall, like, really fit, muscly, like, sculptured face and clean-cut, kind of somehow-always-has-a-tan, guy-in-uniform kind of thing, which... I don't know, I'm not into that kind of thing. I'm just not. I never have been. Come on, Dad, what do you got? "Thankfully, that's an easy answer. "It was my dad's dream "for me to become Division Commander, "and I have prepared for that opportunity my entire life." Masher? The worst part is that he hasn't even asked to meet you two yet. Give each other a kiss. Traitor. Uh-oh. Whoa! - I made you tea. - Tea? How did you make... Lighter fluid! Again! Again! Mmm! Come on, are you kidding me? That's so good. Hey, Supe. You have got to try some of these pancakes Brynn made for us. Or you could try my SPAM cakes that nobody seems to want to touch. I don't care about the pancakes! Why'd you let me sleep in? We thought you wanted to sleep in. I never slept in a day of my life! Well, that's what we thought. But Brynn was... These aren't flapjacks. Those are distract-jacks. - Hold this. - Whoa... Um... - Here. Hold this. - No. No, I can't. I can't. - I have a condition. I... - Thank you so much. I would like to, but if I see somebody cry, I cry. Mark! Please don't cry. I beg of you, please, please don't cry. Don't cry. Wait, wait. I know. How about a little, um... SPAM brulee? How about a giant spoonful of happiness? I can do this. How hard can this be? Whoa! Hard! Very hard! What is going on in here? I thought I said no monkey... You got to let go! I can't get to the hose! She's so sad! - You gave her what? - I gave her my SPAM brulee. - I'm going in! - I'm right behind you! Bubbles! Where'd you go? Come back! Help! Help! Where's the kid? What a rush. My depot. Oh... - My truck! - Ooh! Look, I'm gonna take full responsibility for this. Own up to my mistakes. I feel like I've learned a lot from this experience. - Where's your sister? - Supe, she's on your leg. Bubbles! Not that one. Can I help you find something? Uh... I was just, uh... Looking for a pen. It's been a while since I've written in my journal. Got it. Did I miss something? Oh, yeah. The second I reached the end of my rope. Great. Your parents are on their way. Oh, good. I see you're applying for a big promotion. - Yeah. - Congrats. Seems like your dream job. Whatever it is, the answer's no. Boom-boom. "Boom-boom"? What's boom-boom? No more boom-boom. Looks like your sister needs an oil change. Great. Lieutenant! - Lieutenant! - He's not here. What's going on? Oh! Ho! That's a spicy meatball! Captain. - Perfect timing as always. - Oh! - Come with me. - Oh, I'd rather... If it's all right with you, I'd rather not. Yeah, yeah, that's not good. Okay, here. You think I'm gonna let this rattle me? I put out an entire canyon fire with my bare hands. That's right. Nobody handles poop better than Supe. That sounded a lot better in my head. Oh, Rodrigo's SPAM brulee! That is... Don't look at me. Don't do it, or I'm gonna... I'm good. It's not funny. - Hold down the fort. - Wait! No, no... No, put that... Put that down. You don't need that. You don't need that. Oh! Okay, baby with a nail gun! Nails hurt. Oh. Oh! - I'm going in. - Oh, it's all yours, Supe. I know you were asking for a little space lately, and I think now's the time I gave it to you. Sweet misery. How is that smell getting through an SCBA? This thing's designed to keep out nuclear particles! I need a towel. Masher, bring me that shirt. No, no, no. Whoa, whoa. That's my favorite shirt. Supe, please. No gloves? Oh! Right up the armhole! You know what? Keep the shirt. - Captain! - You need more soap. Got it. Wow. Jake sure has you at his beck and call. Well, it is my job, and he is my boss, so... Yeah, but do you ever want to do anything just for you? Okay, uh, let me explain something. Six years ago, I was working as an accountant, and I had to meet up with a client in Big Bear Lake. And we got trapped on the wrong side of a Category G wildfire. I thought I was a goner. And then, out of nowhere, comes Supe, a smokejumper. I didn't even know that was a job you could have. I was an accountant. My dad was an accountant, his father, my uncle... Oh, my gosh, my aunt... I think I have three second cousins... You get the point. And they're all heroes. To me. In their own way. But that day, I realized that my calling was not with the family business, and I started training. - What about you? - What? Do you have anything you love? That you do just for yourself. Oh. Art. I used to paint. That's really cool. You definitely should get back into that. And then, maybe you will find someone to inspire you the way Supe did me. I hope not. Look, I know you don't see it, but... Supe, he has a sweet side. Captain, get in here, stat! Or I swear you'll be on latrine duty for the next six months! Good talk. All right, little man, this is your mess, - but I ain't mad at you, okay? - Okay. As long as we leave this spotless, all right? The Five P's. "Proper Presentation Prevents Poor Performance." Okay. Let's clean this up real good, now. Come on. Whoa! That's awesome. What's in there? That's our fire training simulator. Tea? Whoa. So what do you think of the fire simulator? That's so cool. Tea for you. Tea for you. Cheers. Brynn, you want some tea? Sure, Z. Right now I need to show you something, okay? We'll be right back, Mr. Axe. Finally. All right, let's get to work. Smoke? What are you doing? Don't drink that. Trust me. Confirmed Class D forest fire. Reporting structures in its path. Requesting a fire line and suppression foam at my location. Copy that, little captain. Requesting a fire line... Wait a minute. Come on, how did you know that? My dad and I used to watch fire shows together. - Oh, yeah? - Okay, we've got two victims just half a klick away. Okay, two victims at half a klick. We got two victims at half a... Two victims? That's... That's a lot of victims here. Half a klick is pretty far, I don't know... I don't know. I... I got to call for backup. I need backup! No. No time for backup, Torres. It's up to us to rescue those people. Kid, we got to bail. We got to get out of here. We gotta go, I can't do this. Oh! Now, buck up, Lieutenant. I know you've never believed in yourself, but I do! And your team believes in you. And now I need you to believe in yourself! You got this. Yeah. Yeah, I got this. I got this. As Lance Armstrong once said, "That's one small step for man, "but you better watch out for the next one." It's Neil Armstrong. And that's not what he said. I'm gonna save those people, or my name ain't Rodrigo Alejandro Garcia Rosenstein Torres. Oh, hi, Supe. I was just showing Will here how to use the, um... Yo, yo, where'd he go? You got to be kidding me. Hey! What are you doing? She tricked us! Whoa! She took my keys! What are you doing? Yo! She oiled the driveway! Whoa! Whoa! - Hold on. - There's oil everywhere! Oh, nice split, Supe. It's too slippery! If you go, I go. Supe! You need a helmet! Supe? Did we kill you? Are you dead, Supe? Guess I forgot the parking brake. What are you doing? Why would you run away? Your parents are gonna be at the depot any minute. I was worried they'd freak out on me. They left me in charge, and the cabin burned down. I panicked. You did it this time, okay? My men can't even take the chopper to come look for us because they need proper authorization, and I'm the proper authorizer. We... At least a five-mile walk. Uphill! Guess your parents are gonna have to wait for their family reunion. Mama. Just tell him, Brynn. Look... Our parents are in Africa, getting an experimental procedure. Brynn. Okay... You can't tell anybody this, but our parents work for a secret government organization. Brynn! Spit it out! Our parents, they're not coming. Why? They died, two years ago. Who have I been texting with? I had no idea. I'm sorry. Why didn't you tell me? Because we ran away from foster care, and I knew you'd call Child Protective Services. A month ago, we found out that they're gonna separate us. Okay, look, it's... It's too dangerous to hike at night, so I'm gonna go find a place for us to hunker down, and... We'll get out of here at first light, okay? And trust me, you guys are in good hands. Gotcha. Who wants chipmunk? Nobody. Nobody in the whole world. Where'd, uh... Where'd all this come from? My backpack. And a little from your supply closet. Hot cocoa? Yes. Hey, Supe, where you going? Nature calls. Back in a few. Thanks. What is it? She's scared out here. She doesn't want you to leave. There's no reason to be scared. Bear sightings are pretty rare. Bears? Smooth. Trust me, Zoey, this is not a trip you want to join me on. I can't go with you looking at me. - Could you look away? - No. Fine. I'll look away. Okay, stop. Boom-boom? Nope. Not happening. No boom-boom. Bears! Stay behind me. Sparkle Pony! - Masher. - Sparkle Pony! Good night, Sparkle Pony. I got to say, your camping skills, they're on point. That's what the kids say, right? Something like that. You know, I lost my parents at a young age, too. I was too young to remember my mom. My dad died on the job when I was a kid. Sorry. Brynn, you gotta stop running. You should be in school. You should be making friends. Causing a different type of trouble. Trust me, you don't want to look back on all this and realize you never had a chance to be a kid. Sorry for all the monkey business. That's what the old guys call it, right? Apparently, we do. I know you don't owe us any favors, but it's Zoey's birthday in two days. I'd hate for that to be the day she remembers them splitting us up. I'll call CPS tomorrow, tell them to come Monday. Thanks. Good night. Good night, Brynn. No, no, I, uh... Yes, I completely understand. - What's he saying? - I can't understand. Just got off the phone with CPS. Looks like you're stuck here until Monday! - What? Oh, yes. Yes, yes, yes! - Yeah! Yay! Now, I have an application to fill out. And I'll need all hands on deck to get this place shipshape before Commander Richards arrives. - Where's my Redding Crew at? - Everywhere! My abuelita used to make the most delicious jalapeno chocolate cake you ever had. It's the secret ingredient. Jalapeno chocolate? Sounds weird, but when you taste it, it's so... It's so... I touched my mouth. My mouth is on fire. My mouth, it's burning! My grandma always said, never touch your face with... Now my eye's burning. My eye's burning and my lips are on fire! It hurts! It hurts! It hurts! Oh! Who wants SPAM-a-kopita? Nope. Come on, I made it with extra gluten. It's got spinach in it and everything. Hey, Supe. Supe. Is it supposed to smoke like that? Maybe the coals aren't hot enough, huh? Smells good! Dr. Hicks! "Teach a man to light a fire, and he's warm for a day. "Light a man on fire, he's warm for life." - Ben Franklin. - Oh, come... I hope this isn't my fault. I was just dropping off some puzzles for the kids, and... I was just very surprised to see you doing something so fun. - Me? - Yeah. - I'm Mr. Fun, okay? - Oh. - Yeah. - I feel like Mr. Fun would go by his first name and not "Mister." But I don't know, you know. I don't know. Yeah. I knew you could handle it. I mean, kids are like fires. You know, you can't... You can't control them, you just have to... Contain them till they burn themselves out. - That's actually right. - I know. I didn't know you knew anything about fire. Well, someone I went on 2.5 dates with talks about them a lot. Maybe I listened a little more than I let on. And here I thought all you cared about was the Western Spadefoot because their secretions smell like peanut butter and can cause sneezing. Somebody I went on 2.5 dates with talks a whole lot about toads. And I listen a little bit more than I let on. Maybe we don't hate each other. There's no way that can be true. - Mmm-mmm. - Be quiet. You be quiet. Don't say "act casual" when you're trying to act casual! - Well... - Yeah. Why don't you kids shower up, and I'll take another stab at getting that grill going, safely. All right, I'm gonna go, then, back to my trailer. My dinner's not gonna microwave itself. I'm gonna go. All right, bye. So organized. Bye. What? You're just gonna let her go? What a whiff. "Whiff"? How'd I whiff? Well, you were talking to her, and then she left, and it was a bit of a whiff. Open your eyes, dude! She's spending the weekend alone. In an eco lab. No kids. No crying. It sounds like a dream come true. J-Dawg, come on, man. That's mad absurd. People like being around people! "People who need people are the luckiest people in the world." Barbara Bush. So close. You should invite her back. Huh? What, here? No, "in the Kingdom of Equestria, where everything is 20% cooler." Rainbow Dash. That might be right. No. Nope. I told you, attachments, distractions in this line of work? No, it doesn't go good. Jake, you need to practice letting your guard down. I'm not good with any of that stuff. Well, this is my area of expertise. I don't know, Superintendent. What's up with you? That was quick. Okay, now we're gonna reply with something clever. I can take it from here. - What do I say? - It's easy. You just say, "Hey, baby. You, me, dinner. No presh." "No presh"? Yeah, no presh. He's right. 'Cause it's flirtatious, and yet not threatening, you know? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - I'm just gonna keep it simple. Dear Dr. Hicks, I am sending you this text alert... - "Alert"? Text alert? - ...to see if you are available - to convene for a... - Jake. It sounds like you're filling out your dull application. You don't say what you're feeling. You show it. "No presh"? Poop. Poop, poop, poop. Zoey, no. Wait. What is this? What are these... Chocolate-dessert-looking things... Ice cream, right? Yeah, that's what it is! It's chocolate ice cream! Great. Who doesn't love ice cream, right? Uh, yeah, don't do that. That's wrong, little man. - No, no... - Don't lie to him. I think you're good on the ice cream. - Supe, did you just send that? - Yeah. Mmm... "Dot, dot, dot." - What is dot, dot, dot? - That means she's answering. In Morse Code? The dots are gone. She hung up. Disappeared. That means she changed her mind. Supe, relax. All right, all right. Bit anxious, okay? I got a full audience watching me go down in flames here. Not good. Not good for morale, - not good for me. - Okay. She's taking her time 'cause she wants to get it right. - Breathe. - Right. Smiley-face icon? No, uh, "emoji." - Frog icon? - Emoji. Wine-bottle emoji? What does that mean? Means you got yourself a date, stud. Yay, Jake, you got a date. Yeah, Supe! Whoo-hoo! General Tso's chicken isn't made by a general. Coq au vin is not a vehicle. But it's... It's not chocolate covered? - Wag! - Look at you! Whoo-hoo! Surprise! We cleaned it up for you. To thank you for saving us. That's just where he had it, too. It's beautiful. - Thank you. - Knock, knock! - Oh. - Hey! - What a pleasant surprise. - So good to see you. Welcome. - Thank you for having me. - Yes, absolutely. - I brought cookies! - Yay, cookies! Maybe just one before dinner. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Can I partake? - Sure. Ooh! Oh! Toad cookies. These look toad-ally delicious. Do I detect a hint of nutmeggery? - No. - No? Really? Cimmanom? - Hmm? - Huh? - Comin' in hot. - Hi! Oh, wait. I have this all... - There you go. - Oh, presentation. - May I take your coat? - Yes. What a gentleman! - Thank you. - No. - Shall I put these in water? - Oh. - Yes. - Good idea. - Thank you. - Make yourself useful. - Right? - Rodrigo! Oh. I got to go. I think it's going well. - Thanks for coming, Dr. Hicks. - You can call me Amy. You can call me Supe. - Or Jake. - Yeah. - Jake's more casual. - "Jake." I'm gonna go put these on a dessert platter. Okay. Don't think we have a dessert platter. Okay. Truth is, I'm really glad he invited me. - Yeah? - Yeah. I mean, it's not just because I'm the only woman in a 100-mile radius, right? No. I think he really likes you. - Thank you, sir. - You're welcome, sir. Thank you! You're welcome. Bon appetit. - Okay. - Let's go. Thanks, guys. - This is pretty amazing. - What an exciting meal. Wow. I love a barbecue. Look at them. Oh, I sure hope they have a beautiful romance and live happily ever after like Romeo and Juliet. This is fun. Friendship is magic. These cookies are now open for business. - Oh, hello! - Yum, yum. Yummy, yummy to my tummy. Hey, Supe, why don't you play us a song? - You play the piano? - Not really. Plus, I know for a fact that thing hasn't been tuned in years. We're all set, Supe. Thank you, Captain. Come on, Axe. Let's go. Play! Okay, I'm a little rusty, so we got to keep it simple, but the request lines are open! - Ariana Grande. - BTS. Chance the Rapper. Drake. Post Malone. Kendrick Lamar. Wu-Tang Clan. Lil Pump. Okay, I'll be doing the choosing. But I hope your shoes are tied, 'cause your socks are about to get rocked off! ♪ I fell into a burnin' ring of fire ♪ - Johnny Cash? - Yeah. - Ring of Fire? - I know what it is. Okay, not the vibe of the room. That's fine. I'm about to take it from zero to a hundred. ♪ The heat is on ♪ On the street ♪ Inside your head ♪ And every beat ♪ The heat is on! ♪ Glenn Frey! Heat Is On! Nobody? Really got your finger on the pulse. Don't tell me you only know how to play songs that are fire-related. No. Yes. I grew up in a fire depot. Uh... Okay, it's late. You got to go to bed. You don't want to be tired - for your birthday, right? - Yeah! Yeah. Let's get you to bed. Let's go. Here's some water. Good night. - See you in the morning. - Um, Supe? No more songs, I'm all tapped out. Then how about a story? - Zoey's already asleep. - Fine. I want a story. I don't know any. That's okay, you can make one up. That's not really how I'm wired, bud. I just... I don't have... An imagination? Are you kidding me? You are the most creative guy I know. We would've never contained the West Fork Valley fire if you hadn't thought to trigger an avalanche. - Show us what you got. - Yeah, come on, come on. Show us, Supe, come on. Okay. Okay. All right... Once upon a time, uh, there was a Yeti. A brave Yeti. He protected all the other Yetis, and he had the most shipshape cave on Yeti Mountain. And one day the Yeti had a kid named Jake. And the Yeti had to take care of the kid all by himself. Now, the Yeti did the best he could to make that cave a home, but sometimes it was hard for the Yeti. But the kid loved it. One day, there was a fire on the mountain. And the Yeti went to go fight the fire. And he got distracted. Never made it back. Maybe the Yeti was thinking of the kid when he took his eye off the ball. The kid felt so guilty that he swore he'd never let anything get in the way of achieving everything the Yeti sacrificed for him. To this day, every time that kid sees fire he can hear the Yeti's voice. When you saved us from that fire, could you hear the Yeti? You know what, I could. Now get to sleep, or I'm gonna give Axe direct orders to eat that cake all by himself. - Um, Supe? - Yeah. Thanks. I haven't seen Brynn this happy in... Well, it's like she's the old Brynn. - Hey, Jake? - Yeah? I forgot. I found these outside the depot on the ground. Figured you might want 'em back. Yeah. Thanks, Brynn. Also, you should ask Amy to stay the night. That's inappropriate. Calm down, Romeo. There's like seven extra bunks in here. And you can't just let her drive home in the middle of the night. Besides, it's Zoey's birthday tomorrow. We want her to be here. Ah... Hey, Jake? Guard down. Is that your dad? Yeah. That's him. Carving the depot turkey at Thanksgiving and decorating the depot tree. You're really lucky to have so many memories in one place. When I was a kid, we moved around a lot, so I would have to find whatever lake or pond or stream was closest, and make all those critters my friends. Pretty lucky critters, I'd say. Whatever. - Hey, Supe? - What? I mean, what do they want now? It's just that those kids, those ninos, they're so amazing, you know? Yeah, they are pretty cute. We'll probably never see them again after Zoey's birthday. And we didn't even get any presents for her. - Not even a card. - Well, what do we do? The roads have dried up and the stores at the bottom of the mountain are open for another hour. I could copter us there if you needed me to. - Not gonna happen. - No, that's okay. No, no, no. We can make it, if we go full out. Listen, the kids wanted you to spend the night to go to their birthday party tomorrow anyway. Would you mind watching them for a little bit? And not because you're a woman. Okay. Thank you. Now... - Where's my Redding Crew at? - Everywhere! You know what? Let's get Brynn and Will some stuff, too. If we're gonna make it a party, we should make it a good one. We'll cover more ground if we spread out. - Move out! - Yes, sir! Hmm... Whew. Ooh, ooh, ooh! A drone. Do you know if this is a good toy for a three-year-old girl? Are you sure she doesn't want a drone? Is there any world at all where a three-year-old girl would want a drone? Okay. All right. Oh, gosh, yes, the bike! - Excuse me, I need that. - Hey! Equestria! Oh, you know it, girl. There she is, the birthday girl. Happy birthday, Zoey. - She's quick. - Are you bigger today? This is beautiful, Brynn! Wow. I love you. Yay. Cheers. Look at all these presents! You know, maybe one or two in there are for you and Brynn as well. Really? Why? Well, we didn't know if we were gonna be invited to your birthdays, so we figured, let's celebrate now. Go! Wow. I love it. Will, open this one next. Welcome to the team. - Thank you! - Oh! Hey, you ever need us, this will help us find you. - Is this a laser? - It is. Thank you, that's so cool! Oh, no. Oh, no. No, don't... Don't do that. No, don't do that. I got you something, too. I didn't want you to feel left out. Ta-da! - Whoa! - Ow! Ow! - I didn't even... - I'm just kidding. It smells a little like carbon dioxide, but it's legit. This means a lot to me. Well, I did it for the Western Spadefoot. I'll be sure to let them know. Hey, Supe, we got this for you. Um, it's from everyone. It's a... It's a T-shirt. That's Princess Celestia, the leader of the ponies. Come on. Try it on. Yeah, put it on, put it on! Something like this I should probably save for a special occasion. What could be more special than right now? - Mmm-hmm. - Fine. I'll try it on. It... It's... A shirt. See? It fits perfectly. - Oh, hey. - Hey, guys. Look at that. Look at these stickers on these helmets. Oh, look, you got... You got Rainbow Dash. - Known for her loyalty. - Oh, thanks, guys! Oh, no, you didn't. No, you didn't! Shut up! Get out of here! I got Fluttershy. - Known for her kindness. - Aww. Thank you, Zoey. Oh, wait, wait. Axe, you got... Pinkie Pie? What's wrong with Pinkie Pie? Nothing wrong with it. Just that Pinkie Pie's known all over the Kingdom of Equestria for her mad-infectious laughter. Oh, my gosh. What's going on? - Have you ever seen that before? - Never seen it before! ♪ My Little Pony My Little Pony ♪ What is friendship all about? ♪ My Little Pony My Little Pony ♪ Friendship is magic! ♪ You can make sound. He can sing! What's everybody doing standing around? Who wants to party? Whoo! Me! Watch it. Oh! Oh! Oh... Bring it! Come on! Ow! Hey, hey, hold it! You missed! You missed! Sucker! - Throw! Come on, throw! - I got it! Hey, Zoey. Zoey! I got you. Come on, hurry. Whoa! No, I'm fine. I'm great. Let's go. Here we go now! Don't drop it, don't drop it, don't drop it... - Don't make it fall. - Shh! - Shh! - Look out! - Easy! - Come on, man. - Don't mess up! - Okay, well, now it's over. ...the Jaws of Life. Wait, is that why it's called "the Jaws of Life"? They're gonna fall in love. Then they're gonna move in together. They're gonna rely on each other for everything. Who's gonna need me now? Don't drop it. Don't drop it. Supe! Supe! Supe! Hey! This is supposed to be a fire depot! Jenga! Commander Richards! You said you weren't gonna show up until tomorrow. Kinda takes the surprise out of "surprise inspection" to show up on the day I said. Besides, look what I would have missed. I can see seven code violations from where I stand. You heard the Commander! Who authorized putting this stuff up anyway? Um... Somebody? You tell that man to pack his bags and go! Um... Okay. Carson, who do these children belong to? Hello! Hello! Oh, great. Another party guest. Patty Welch, Child Protective Services. I take it these are the children we talked about. I thought you were gonna give us the day to celebrate together. I was. I told her not to come until tomorrow. I told you that! Oh, I'm so sorry. You see, CPS is not a fast-food restaurant. - You don't get to "have it your way." - Tea? We've been looking for these children for the past month. ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ Happy birthday, dear Zoey ♪ Happy birthday to you! ♪ No! I got it! Aw, Come on! I can't believe that you are Dan Carson's boy. Hey! You can't talk to Supe like that. He's right. This is what happens when you let your guard down. - Jake... - You don't understand. If I get distracted, I can't do this job effectively. Without this job... What am I? Now I think I've heard enough. Where are the kids? We had... Where's my Humvee? Do you have your keys? - No. - Yup, that's what she does. - We should... - Take your truck, right. - My tires are flat. - Mine, too! I got this. Brynn, what are we doing? I'll figure something out. - Bunny. - I'll get you another one, Zoey. - Bunny. - We can't! Bunny! I'm stuck. I'm stuck! It's gonna be okay, Zoey. Wait. I have an idea. You're breaking every protocol in the book, Superintendent. With all due respect, Commander, we will look for these kids until I know they're okay. I'm ordering you to turn this chopper around. Those kids are our responsibility. - If you want out, grab a chute. - What did you just say to me? I got contact on Will, ten o'clock! On second thought, - I'll grab it. - Wait, what are you doing? - Take Zoey and get out of here. - The door's stuck. Careful, Will. It worked! Jake's here. Brynn's stuck in there and she can't get out. Brynn! I'm gonna get a line to you! I can't secure the line and hold it. - Think you can get it to her? - Yeah. Zoey, sweetie, I just need you to go sit on that rock over there. Will, pass your sister this knife and line through the window. She needs to tie it around her waist, okay? You're good to go. Go. Hang in there, Brynn! Grab it! Will, what are you doing? Don't climb in here. Will! - Get out of the car! - Everything's gonna be okay. Jake! Come on. Good, good, good. Come on. That's it, I got you. Okay. I got you. You're okay. And you... Are my hero. You did great! My hero. Oh, man. Oh! - I love you. - I love you. I thought you never cried. Please don't tell anybody. - Here, take this one. - Okay, got it. - And this one. - Mmm-hmm. - Nice. - And this one. ...'cause the sun is really great. Yeah. I'm really impressed with how you took care of your brother and sister. Most people would not do that. You're... - You're awesome. - Thanks. All right, come here. One day, I'm gonna be a hero, just like you. You already are, little brotherman. You already are. Come on, put it right there. Ah... Yeah! Smokejumpers! I don't think so. Okay, she can hold it for a bit. - Thank you. - I love you. That's for you. Can you draw me something? Sure. I'll draw you with hair. Where's Supe? - Sir. - No. As you were. Look, Carson... You said earlier, if you had any distractions, you couldn't do this job. I don't think that's true. The people you care about and that care about you aren't distractions. They're the thing that keeps you going. I know we got off to a rocky start. But after seeing what you did back there, there's no doubt in my mind that you're the man for the job. Thank you, sir. Let me know. Oh, here he is! Let's wrap this up. Come on, guys, get out. It's all right. Okay, come on. Get out. Everybody out. Patty, are you familiar with the Safe Haven Law? That is a stupid question. Yes, of course I am. Children cannot be relinquished until the proper authorities are involved. Yeah. I am the proper authority. Don't leave. Stay. With me. You mean here? In the depot? I don't live here full-time. I have a house. You do? You do? Yeah... Hello. This is not how adoption works. Okay? First of all, there's paperwork, interviews, background checks. Yeah. Get it all started. I'm not going anywhere. And I have three children I am not relinquishing. What about your big dream job? Somebody told me once that kids are kind of like fire. You can't control them, you just got to contain 'em till they burn themselves out. That sounds like a dream job to me. Right? Oh! Come on, everybody, we don't have a second to lose. Let's do this. Okay, everybody, we gotta be at the courthouse by 1400... 2:00. Hey! What's up? Come on, man! Here we go! Ta-da! Here comes the bride. Alexa, play BTS. Burning Up Fire by BTS. Sparkle Pony! Sparkle Pony, hurray! All right... - Where's my Wedding Crew at? - Everywhere! Move out! You ready to be Mrs. Fun? That's Doctor Fun, Mister. Yeah, hit it, hit it. Hit it. Whoo! Look at that! - Look at that! - Oh, my God! Killin' it, killin' it! Don't underestimate the powers of the dark side of the Force. There's too much. That's not a real child. Look at me. Look at me. Stay with me. No, that's a... ...to collect water for the dumps... - For their dumps. - Yeah. I'm not gonna be able to say that line. You will not use Fisher Lake to collect water for their dumps. And now it looks like you're gonna have to sign it, too. ...to collect water for their dumps. And now it looks like I'm gonna have to... Does he always carry that axe? Why y'all looking at me? Because you're supposed to give an answer. Keep rolling, the same spot for John. And action. You were given a chance. You were given an opportunity... Did I get out of frame? I can do it better! Don't... I know I can. - I can't do it better. - I know he cannot. Millennials! Superintendent Jake Carson. And you can call me that, the whole thing. This is... - Uh... - This is Keegan. He left. Captain, did you... Excuse me... Sir. Hey, we made it. Let's go eat. Oh, my God, he would be so... Big Dan would be so proud.
