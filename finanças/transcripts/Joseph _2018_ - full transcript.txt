(Police march past in progress) Can you stop this music? What's this medal for, sir? Did you get the medal, sir? Hey! Look straight and drive. So sir didn't get the award? This is nof mine. It belongs to a friend of mine. Where is he? Abhidasan was caught while smuggling fake notes. To the latest breaking news... An old couple was found murdered inside their house, at Thodupuzha. Vazhuthala Palaykkal Kuriakose and his wife Eliamma, are the deceased. The brutal murder of the old couple was discovered only this morning. There was no one else in the house. Yes sir. - Didn't you see the news? Yes, sir. - You come here. I'll come. A E Sir. Shall we begin the inquest? I'll tell you. Who's he waiting for, without doing the inquest? I left home early in the morning. I couldn't even take a shit properly. Don't you knowJoseph, who retired some time back? He is waiting for him. Please move. Move! Move! Move. He has been waiting for a long time. Where is sir? Over there. Do a check quickly. It's already late. E a What are you doing here? Just like that. Did you find anything? This was lying here. We found one print. I think it's that way. Can I get a ladder? E1! Don't allow any media to enter inside, until the body is taken out. Will do, sir. Sir, the guy who came was definitely intending to steal. But he's not an Assamese or Bengali. Someone who knows them quite well, Someone who's quite healthy and fit. He hasn't broken the door open. How's that possible? Just because he didn't break the door open, it needn't be someone they know. What ifthey opened the door, hearing a knock on the door in the night? That's also a possibility, right? Ifthat was the case, the body would have been lying next to the door. There are all indications that the guy sat on that sofa. So? -You do the inquest, and send the bodies for postmortem quickly. Sir! Call for the ambulance. Sir! Their relatives? They have two daughters. These are their husbands. Who saw the crime scene first? My son, sir. He saw it when he went to deliver milk. They are his uncle and aunty. You carry on. A a It was around 5 - 5.30 AM, sir. Iwas the one who informed the police station. Did you hear any noise from here between 8 PM & 10 PM? I had gone for a movie, sir. Only mom was at home. And you? Mfiamflm pflna a Thrissur. Whatdo you do? Business. What business? Finance. Where were you yesterday? I was at a friend's place in Patthanamthitta. I was in the Gulf. I just came back to Kerala. I was at Ernakulam yesterday. Have you come back for good? - Yes. Get me a pen and paper. All your names and phone numbers. IE a Here you go. Take them inside. Come on. Enough! Move! Hey! Do you have any stuff with you, Sugunan? How will I have anything, sir? If you give money, I can send someone to buy it. What is this? Ijust need 2 drinks. M a Brother, is there any way to get 2 glasses? WEBER; E Let's go till there. - Okay. Hey! Sir and I have to discuss something. You wait here. I'll be back. - Okay. Check tower locations of all numbers. - Don't miss anything. Efimgw Okay! I'll buy. Brother... Hows the chit fund company of the elder son in law doing now? There's something fishy about him. That's true. - I don't know all that, sir. He used to create a ruckus asking for his share at times. But uncle & aunty said that they would give it only aftertheir death. A EU ammmflmg] Sir, you can sit inside. No, brother. Just get 2 glasses. What's the stuff? The stuff is superb. But it's local. Open it. Is it good? How do you even drink this? Drink it fast, sir. Hold it. Here you go, sir. Shall I fix the drink? Brother, can you buy some Pepsi or something to mix? Its E m? E M' mm! I need it. - Okay. Hey! - Sir. What is it, sir? Where did that Joseph go? He has gone to booze with the guy who came to take the body. Hello! Tell me. Where did he go, sir? He's not good company. SHEEN flmBflfiflté'? E Com e. He is the culprit, sir. It's notme, sir. It's notme, sir. It's notme, sir. It's notme, sir. It's not me, sir. - Brother... It's notme, sir. The fingerprints on the bulb that you removed and kept there, and the fingerprints on the glass that you gave now, are the same. And the hand-knife that you took from here... However much you wash it, the forensic department will find it. The calendaryou used to cover it. Wasn't it from here? - It's not me, sir. I don't know, sir. Sir.. - Isn't all this enough? Shall I leave, sir? Sir... Take him to the jeep. - Move this side. Sir, please. - Don't wobble! Sir.. - Get the handcuffs. Joseph! Move.. - Please sir. How did you understand that it was him? Sir, I understood that it wasn't done by a professional, since he left the bulb there, without breaking it. There are all indications of him hanging on to the sunshade, and climbing to the terrace, over there. Only a healthy and fit person can do it. He has tried to break open the middle pan ofthe door on the top floor. No professional would do that. They would always try to break open a corner. There are no marks or signs of struggle on the front door. The doorwas definitely opened by a person who was inside. If that's the case, the one who came there, was someone they knew. There were all indications of him sitting on the sofa. The cinema page ofthe magazine that was lying there, was kept open. The magazine's page, and his posture on the sofa, indicated that it was a young man. The tea vessel on the stove was fully burnt. The crime was committed when someone went to make tea, for the guest. I confirmed that it was a healthy young man from the locality, who is known to the victims, who committed the crime, from the crime scene. When I had called the relatives to question them, I had noticed Manu, who stayed away, with folded hands. According to body language, standing with folded hands, means that he's hiding something. And from the movements of his eye-balls while he was explaining things, I understood that he was lying. The one who lied about having gone for a movie in the night, was in this tower location until 9.30 PM. The Cyber cell confirmed that. - Oh no! My son! - Shalll leave, sir? A a Don't do anything to my son. My son! Manu! - Move away! _S°n! - Manu! - Don't take him away! - Don't take my child away! - Don't take my child away, sir. - Manu, my son!

Pathrose, get the glass. - Hey Joseph! Ever since hejoined the service, he has been sticking on to you. He studied as my daughter's senior. He's an engineer. He's wasting his life by working in the cyber cell. - Hold this. - Enough. We need to find some other pastime instead of boozing. I'm getting bored of it. - You stop it then. There's no other problem. The battery has to be changed. 5000 Rupees gone! Well, you have money, right? Shall I? - Okay. Well, the SP and DYSP claimed the credit for today's case as well, right? Even when he was in service, it was others who got the name and fame for the work he did. Right? What's wrong with him to go behind all this? - He's crazy. Dude, didn't we go behind so many cases and corpses for 30 years? Ijust keep whiling away my time boozing, and such chances come across very rarely. We shouldn't forget the job we learned, right? You and your... - Yeah right! What? Rag havan sir, shall we leave? - Okay. Keep this in the car. M; a Aren't you Nair, ofthat old vehicle theft case? Yes. - What are you doing here? Hey!

That was the only thing lacking! Hey! Stan the car! Okay then. Him & his rocket. - See you tomorrowthen. Dear... Your policeman is here. Don't fool around and listen to me. You should go to the Church on Sunday. You should confess, and accept the Holy Qurbana. You heard me? Ichaya, can you please apply this oil? Hey husband! Just come here! You used to be so affectionate earlier. Dear, take your Papa away. What are you writing so seriously? What is this, Papa? Shouldn't you knock the door before coming? I'm a big girl now, right? Big girl, it seems! Is it a love letter? Yeah right! As if love letters are written so openly. You write one, dear. Mommy didn't leave you for nothing! This is how you behave, right? Hey Papa! Don't be upset. I was just joking. Mom! The policeman is going away, all upset. Yes! You? Where the hell is your phone? Where is it? Hey! Stella had an accident. It's supposed to be quite serious. She is at City Hospital. I don't know anything more. You get ready quickly. Get ready, man! Com e. Let's go. Peter tried calling you many times. Since he couldn't get through to you, he called me to say it. Chetta, can you go and sit there? - Sorry. Peter. She has been shifted to the ICU now after the operation. Can we see her? I don't know if they would let you see her. Who is Stella's husband? It's me. What is it, Sister? - Doctor is calling you. What is it, Doctor? She is really scared. She's asking you to stay along. What happened? It's nothing. You'll be fine. Don't cry. You'll be fine! It's okay. 'My dear, I showered as a rain on the path where you were burning in the heat' 'Let the lullabies never falter, my sweetheart' 'To put you to sleep on my chest' It's a girl. We had a baby girl. 'You should grow as big as the rainbow on the sky, my dear' 'I shall wait to receive you like the waves of the sea' Herface is exactly the same as Stella. It's always better for girls to have the mother's features. She is definitely a Mommy's child. Dear... Enough! Give the baby back. You can play with her later. Careful. We know, sir. 'My dear, I showered as a rain on the path where you were burning in the heat' 'Let the lullabies never falter, my sweetheart' 'On a turfthat no one has seen' See! This is how you apply oil. 'I shall provide the rhythm of the song sung by the cuckoo' Can you get me the oil? Or should I do that too?

She had gone to the Church to attend the Qurbana in the morning. They said that somejeep hit her. Some other car which came after that, brought her here. Who is Stella's husband? Shall we go? Call us ifthere's anything you need. It's okay. Continue this medicine. - Doctor... I am Stella's husband. Yeah. There's an emergency with Stella. I have to discuss with you. Please come. Hey! Dude, if you loved her so much, why did you both get separated? Even after such a long while, I... Not just me... None of us have asked you about this. Let him say it, if he's ableto say it. Your son and family is doing good, right? - They are in Bombay, rig ht? They have reached Kerala. They said they would come. They will definitely come. Fmmafibm a You carry on then. Go inside. Efitsfilm Mammy? Awedding is going to happen here, and not much celebrations, huh? Have you bought some good stuff? - Of course! Com e, Achaya. Dad and son have come alone to celebrate, huh? Ask them like that, Father. It's your brother's daughter's wedding, Joy. C-mflzflm EEK; Glory be to the Lord, Father. Where's yourwife, and Lisamma? - All ofthem have come. Glory be to the Lord, Father. Now and forever. Glory be to the Lord, Father. Now and forever. Your daughter is all grown up, Joy. Shouldn't you get her married? It will happen this year, Father. Even Kurianakkunnil Kariachan was like this. He kept his girl at home saying he'd get her married soon. And now she's around 35 years old. Varkey, the motor is faulty. It's not pumping water. Call someone. Where did that Joseph go? - He was here somewhere. Joseph! Joseph! - There he is. Over here. Oh! You're over there? What is it, Achaya? Dude, the motor is networking. I'll get that sorted. Coming. Hold me. Let's bring the one from the field here. (flflmn a Joychaya, how are you? ER; It's a relief that he is here. Uncle, where is Minimol? E51 E Give it, mom. - Here. Father, shall we? When did you reach, dear? - Just now. Why? Didn't you go to get the motor? He has gone. So much attitude. Hey! Did you read the letter? Yes. Liked it? I loved it. Tell me. I loved it, dear. They are planning my wedding. Hey Joseph! What is it, Father? What are you doing there? - I came to pee. There? I was also looking for such a place. There are people at every corner. What can I do? Did you finish peeing? You both were acting very well overthere. Instead of making people talk by hiding here and there, go meet Kunjachan and ask him to get her married to you. You should talk to him and son it out, Father. Yeah right! As if my job is to fix your alliance! Father... My family is considering other proposals. Can you please talk to him? Now you get going. Go! Don't tell anyone, Father. Get lost. My dear Father... Isn't it better to drown my daughter in this lake, than doing that? Ajobless fellow! And he's going tojoin the police! Should I get my daughter married to a guy who just roams around boozing? You have your prayers and everything, right? You do that, Father. It's true, Joy. The father should decide what's good for his children. And not the Father ofthe Church. You're being reasonable now, Father. David! - Yes, Achaya. Wait. What's happening? - Doing good. When did you come? - I came yesterday. Hovv's the business going? - Going good. I shouldn't have. What did he say? It won't happen, Joseph. He won't get that girl married to you. First you find a good job. And when you get close orfall in love, it should be with people who are equal to you. Or else, you'll have to be disappointed like this. What happened? What did he say? It's okay. - Tell me. It will be fine. I will marry you. Then why is your face like this? Nothing. You carry on. Someone will see us. Em E Hey! I'm going to do the 'Margamkali' dance. Ask that man to get lost! Everyone in this town know about your relationship. Then who's going to marry her? - Leave that topic. I'll go to the kitchen & bring some munchies. - That will be great. (Traditional song for the Margamkali dance) 'The girl with dark blue eyes' 'The girl with rainbowwings' 'The girl who came with a blue pea flower mole, on her cheek' 'The girl who braided her hair, like beautiful black clouds' 'Why did you shoot an arrow with your eyes to my chest, one fine day?' 'Why did you shoot an arrow with your eyes to my chest, one fine day?' (Traditional song for the Margamkali dance) 'You're staying aflame like a ray of moonlight' 'Every moment, through the window of my hean' 'You are the life that beats in my hean' 'You are my trembling breaths' 'You set my veins on fire' 'My hean showers as droplets of snow, tojoin you' 'In your eyes that are endless rivers, lam like a clueless fish' 'Love is a wave of pleasure stroked by the feather of dreams' And then? You've never seen her afterthat? By the timel came back after my training, she was already married. Two years after that, I got married to Stella. Do you remember when we went for the Kaliyar inquest? There's no information about him, right? Yeah. Nothing at all. It was me who called you, sir. Is anyone staying here? No. Just a husband and wife. Children? - No, sir. He was a real alcoholic, sir. That girl is from a good household in Alappuzha. Because of his drinking, everything was ruined. They were staying on rent here. It's not locked. Member, we need a couple of witnesses. We've arranged that, sir. Call them. Member, get some gloves, incense, frankincense and what not. Go bring it. - Come. - Ratheesh, light it. - Sabu, go buy some incense sticks. Hey! Open those windows. Hey! Click from all angles. Take the measurements. Joseph, hold from here. M a 167 cm... Hold over there. M EM' So 61 cm... Now, cut the dress. Here. Keep it there. Give me the blade. We should have come after having couple of drinks. It must be at least 4 days old. Right? - Yes. Who is this? That's this girl's wedding photo. Wasn't it this girl who came to the station last week? With a complaint? Rig ht, sir? - Yes. That one. Hey Joseph! I had handed over a couple of cases to you last week. Did you open any ofthem? One of them was this girl's. Sir, we had two special duties last week. You know, right sir? Don't tell anyone about this now. What happened? Nothing. Shall I serve dinner? Aren't you having food? - I don't want to. Then shall I keep it back? Hey! I couldn't say anything to Stella. When she came next to me, I would remember Lisamma. Her rotten body... Then I won't be able to do anything. And to hide all this, I started drinking regularly. Stella wouldn't have understood anything. I was afraid to even talk properly to her. Ifl had told her about it, she wouldn't have left me. I could never be the same again. Finally, things happened the way I wished. I want to talk to you about something. Iam your wife! There's a limit in tolerating all this. If you have any other affairs, tell me about it. I'll move away. Howlong has it been since you talked to me properly? I can't tolerate this any longer. Let's get separated. I want my daughter. After two years, she got married to Peter. Ifl was here, I would have gone for herwedding. Whenever I went somewhere, I'd drop our daughter at her place. So I'll see her at times like that. Okay Papa. Good night. (QQFHHWQJQ Bye! Come! I'm really hungry! What's special today? After a long time, I told her everything. She must have told Peter. Peter didn't have a problem in us meeting. Call for you. Hello! It's Peter. He asked me to go there quickly. What happened? Doctor said that there's no point in keeping her on the ventilator anymore. The doctor asked whether we would like to donate any of her organs. How can I take a decision alone? Doctor is calling Diana's parents. It's been over 40 days since Diana has been on the ventilator here. The injury on her brain which happened when she fell down that day, hasn't been cured through surgery as well. The infection has also increased quite a bit. Her body is not at all responding to medicines now. Very sorry to inform you... Her life is being sustained currently, only with the help of the ventilator. Brain death has already happened. I know it's cruel to ask something likethis, atthis point oftime. But if you take a decision now, Diana will live through many others, through organ donation. I'm asking this because I'm a doctor. Please forgive me. You can decide, Doctor. Let our daughter be blessed at least that way. 'You are disappearing beyond the horizon' 'To unknown shores' 'As my palm joins yours' 'Have the seasons withdrawn?' 'Silence turns into burning ember' 'There is nothing left on this earth' mymw My dear people... Stella is leaving all of us. May God almighty reward her in heaven for all her good deeds. Let us console her family members who are grieving her demise. And let us also pray for the salvation ofthe departed soul. In the name ofthe Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit... Those who want to give her a last kiss, can go ahead. Is there anyone left to give her a final kiss? There's one more person. 'Whenl am alone, your memories would caress me' 'Droplets of your love shower gently on the pages of my heart' 'You should become half of my life, in our next birth' 'I can't do without that' mymw 'A golden kiss on your lips with tears' 'You have departed without seeing that' 'l'm covering your face, with the sand within my palm' 'You gave everything to me happily' 'Only that belongs to me' mymw Stella had the accident somewhere over here. Hello! Just a minute. Chandran, tell me. Which case? When I was in Muttam station, right? Okay. I remember. Those files are still there, right? Three... Three seventy six... Right? On what date? Hand it over to the guard. I am nearby only. I'll come to the station. Okay. Em mp? There's a trial for that rape case. I have to check the file once. Or else, thatjudge would rip me apart. Nam aste, sir. - Satheeshan! - Did Chandran give you something? Sir is inside. He hasn't left. - Then I'll meet him. They are doing good. I'll be right back. - Okay sir. So this was the vehicle? Do you know who has the case file? It's with Collins. She was said to be hit by a jeep. Her scooter skidded and hit a rock. Did you find thejeep? We didn't get the number. We are inquiring. Where all were the injuries? Injuries... There was one on her left elbow... And one cut on top ofthe left side of her forehead. But the cause of death is supposed to be through a deep injury behind her head. I need photocopies of all these. I'll give you. And if you have any photos ofthe accident scenes, WhatsApp them to me. I'll do that. Okay then. - Okay. Either side ofthe road, with Poonjar on the south and Kanjar on the north, at Muttam P0, Muttam Panchayat, Muttam village, belongs to the Government. The east side is a valley and the west side is a hill. Around 60 metres North of the temporary tea shop, situated on the East side ofthis road... Around 50 metres South ofthe PWD sign board situated on the North side... From the number-less milestone on the east side ofthe road, around 7 metres North-west... the west side ofthe road, is the exact spot. Nam aste, sir. Are you Xavier, son of Chacko, who has given the witness statement? Yes, sir. Howwas she lying here? She was lying... The head was on that side... and the legs were towards this side... And her hands? Her hands... She was lying on her back like this.. With her hands likethis... ls there any problem, sir? You go and get us 4 glasses of tea. Stella's death was not due to an accident. It's a murder. Hey! I noted the number, sincel hadn't seen the car earlier. Here you go, sir. Do you knowthe people who came in the car? - No. I know everyone in this area. I am a Local Committee member here. How many people were there in thatjeep? Two people. Did they look back after hitting her? Did you see something like that? Driver didn't look back.. The one who was with him, looked. Did the people who came in the car, make calls from here? Not from here, but they called someone after getting into the car. Around what time did the accident happen? The bell forthe 2nd Holy Qurbana had rung by then. That's at 8.30 AM. Call Sudhi and get the RC details of this number. Most probably, this numberwould be fake. Hello sir. KL 58 - 1290. A (flnéfiaflfls Just aminute, sir. Sir... Etsamm a The address is in Thalassery. I'll message it to you now. Okay. As you said, it's a fake number. It belongs to a lorry. Sudhi,just hold on. Sudhi... We need to do a mobile dumping. And when you come, bring the sketch artist Rajesh as well. Stella's accident was created deliberately. They hadn't intended to kill her. It was something else. Why do you feel so? Ifthey had intended to kill her, they could have used a large vehicle. Or they could have hit her into this gorge. If so, they could have hit her at a desened place, right? Why do they need to create a witness? They need a witness, Siddique. If there's no witness, the police would investigate the case. Ifthere's a witness, it will be registered under the accident case section. Usually, ifthe original car is not found, a case is registered with an available car and driver. To claim the insurance. For the relatives to get money... Be more precise... When she was hit by the car, Stella fell to the left side, on her hands. That's how she had a fracture on her left hand. That was the fall with the most force, in this accident. After that, she hit the rock, and there was a cut on herforehead. That's not such a serious injury. Only after that, she fell over there. According to the postmortem report, the cause of death is a deep cut behind Stella's head, by hitting on a sharp rock or something like that. Do you see anything like that over there? Even ifthere is something like that, if she fell on her hands, hit her forehead and fell there, would there be such a deep injury behind her head? That injury didn't happen over here. It was somewhere else. The shopkeeper said that the driver of the car which hit her, didn't look back. If it was an accident that happened unknowingly, he would have looked back. The person who was with him, looked back. That was to confirm Stella's fall. The carwhich came after them, came only to take Stella. The people in the car, are involved in this crime. The shopkeeper said that they were well dressed. Such people, wouldn't put a blood-soaked Stella on their lap and take her. If they had such a good conscience, they would have given their names & address at the hospital, and would have waited at least till Stella's relatives arrived. Sudhi already said that the number of their carwas fake. We should go to Peter's house. Come in. Sit. Was there any difference in Stella's behaviour recently? Any son of fear? I didn't notice anything special. But ever since her daughter died, she was quite depressed. Did she go for the morning Qurbana daily? If she didn't have any other troubles, she would never miss the morning Qurbana. I need to see her room and her phone. Did she have any disease? She was admitted once in the hospital with high pressure. So these medicines were given from there. Joseph... ls there any issue regarding her death? Okay then. We need to get the list ofthe people who accepted Stella's organs. From each ofthose hospitals. Let's meet tomorrow evening. I'll call you. Okay. What are you doing? Mobile dumping. After the accident, when Joseph sir's wife was taken in the car, that lady made a call, right? I'm trying to find that number. Sir, it's me, Sudhi. Dlmhflmu m tum Sir, I have 2-3 more sim cards. I'll call from them too. Please attend those calls. I'll call now, sir. Thank you, sir. How can you get that number, Sudhi? I called from a BSNL sim card. They can precisely know where this call came from, from which pan of which tower. Ifwe go to BSNL, on the day ofthe accident, that is 10/03/2018... between 8 AM and 9 AM, they would give us details of all calls made in this area at that time. Even other companies have almost the same process. So, won't there be so many numbers? No. It will much lesser com pared to the town. Not just that.. Since they are not from this place, it's possible that they would have made only that single call from here. Check.. ls it like this? Yeah.. Like this.. - Almost like this... (éfimm a It's done. - Okay. Do you have any idea which car it was? It was an old car with a boot, sir. Did you see its logo or emblem or something? Emblem... There were some running letters in English... Check if it's this one... This one? This one? This one? Yes. This is the one. This one. Sir, it's a Ford. Show him all the cars of Ford. This one? It was an old model car, sir. Yes. This one. This one, in black colour. Sir, it's a Ford lkon. Sir, our drawing is complete. Check if it's correct... Almost... Someone like this, sir. Hello! - Hello! Hello sir! Where are you? - I am at home, sir. You need to search for an old car. It's a black Ford lkon. The number is fake. Enquire at all places where cars are crushed. Workshops and yards you know. Call your old buddies. Make it fast. - I'll leave rig ht away. Sir, what happened at the court? It's a 4-5 year old rape case, right? How can we remember all that? I held on by blabbering something. Did you find out what I asked? We didn't find anything that we could relate to Stella's death. The organs were donated to four people. Three ofthem are really poor. The fourth person is a retired KSRTC employee. (mm They are people without any political grip. I gotthe numbers ofthe people in the car, and the ones who attended their call. Those connections belong to people from other states. Did you get other numbers called from their number? From that sim card, they have only made calls between themselves. They haven't called anyone else. Those two mobiles are always switched off. Do they call each other regularly? No. Very rarely. Acall was made to that lady's phone, the previous day. A 3 minute call. On the day ofthe incident, that lady has made a 30 second call to the other number. Their phone calls almost followthe same pattern. They call from different Sims inserted in the same mobile. Asim they have used once, has never been used later. These are the call details from last year, ofthe numbers & sim cards she used on that phone. It's Peter. What is he doing here at this time? Anything in particular? No. Nothing like that. I saw this only the other day. The policeman who had written Stella's case file, had called. There's no information about the carthat hit her. He's asking whether they can charge the case with some vehicle, to claim the insurance. I have no idea what to do now. The department usually does that. 'Diana will continue to live, through five people'. Stop here. Let's as k. Acigarette, please. Where is this Vishwan's house? The guy who used to do quotationjobs? The one who got his kidney transplanted last year. Yes. The same person. How is he now? - He is at home only. I heard someone whom he hun earlier, came and attacked him the other day. Where is his house? Don't think anyone can go back alive from here, after hitting me. What do you want? It was my daughter's kidney that was transplanted to you. Whenever any stranger comes to this house, we get scared, sir. Son... Who gave you the money forthe operation? The people of this town made donations and formed a fund... For the past four years, none of her children have come here. All ofthem are abroad. Even forthe operation, only I was there. We're leaving. You're listening to Superhits 93.5 Red FM. So next song is on the way. Is this Renuka's house? - Yes. She's my daughter. It was my daughter's heart that was transplanted for Renuka. Come, sir. I didn't recognize you. You can sit there. Sit down, sir. Isn't your daughter here? She is here only. You want anything to drink? No. Wejust dropped by when we went this way. Thought we'll see her... She is here. How are you now, dear? - What to say, sir? The operation was done with the donation fund formed by the people here. The money we make with so much difficulty, is not enough even for herdaily medicines. We work with ropes, right? She still has breathing problems often. With all the dust here... Sir, we don't need money. I don't have anyone else. Call me if you need anything, dear. Ifshe has breathing problems, there's a friend of mine. He's a cardiologist. Just go and see him. Don't worry about money and medicines. I'll talk to him. This is my number. Just call me. Shall I leave? Didn't Pathrose reach? He has high fever. He has been bedridden for 3-4 days. An email bomb threat at a famous hospital in the state, was found to be fake. Bomb squad and experts from the cyber cell, reached the hospital and investigated. The intention ofthe threat or the source of the email... Isn't that Sudhi? Yes. He hasn't brought back Diana's laptop yet. Yes, sir. - Hey.. Where is Diana's laptop? I've repaired it, sir. I'll bring it in the evening. Just come home. I'll be there. Token 10. What are you doing here? There was some money in Stella's account. I thought I'll withdraw it. I needed some documents for it. I'm planning to hold the 41st day prayer meet on Sunday. All of you should come. Days are passing by so fast. Shall I leave then? I needn't invite specially again, right? No. Accept this soul to the experience the endless joy humans have neverexperienced. To sing your praises happily along with your disciples, purify the hands ofthis soul with the Holy water blessed by You. Forever and always! Hello. Father, about the coffee. The coffee...

Still... So sad! What did the doctor say? He said there's nothing to worry now. You guys always hang out with him claiming to be his friends, right? Then where were you guys? Well, God saved him! Cross? It's been so long since I've seen you in Church! This is not a solution for anything! Suicide is Satan's job! You should beware!

A new sim has been inserted to that lady's mobile. And she has received a call on it as well. It's switched off now. Ifthat phone gets switched on again, mark its location. Ifthere's any change, inform me. Okay sir. I'll call you. Sir, the guy is here. Okay. Go and ask him. Give this there and tell him. Go! Majeed! - Yes. Tell me, Nair. What parts do you need? Let Sir see that car first. We'll say after that. - Then you go and check it. Nair, bring that bag. Here you go, sir. What is this, sir? Benzene. Understood? It's used to find blood stains. Did you see the blue colour? There were blood stains. Stella was taken in this car itself. Is this a stolen car? I shouldn't have a problem for buying the pans. My dear brother, this is the certificate to cancel the RC book &to crush the car. We don't deal with stolen cars. Did the owner bring the car himself? - I don't knowthat. I didn't see anyone other than the one who brought it. He left only after getting it crushed here. Is it him? He looks somewhat like this. Is there any problem, sir? Sir, Namaste. Nam aste. There was an old car for sale here, right? We needed such a carfor movie shooting purposes. We came to see it. It's already sold. Oh no! Do you have the number of the person who bought it? No. Did you give an ad on the newspaper to sell the car? -Yes. Do you rememberwhen you gave the ad? November, December... The last Saturday of January. Did anyone else call seeing the ad? - No. No point in looking for that car now. They would have crushed it. He had come again after taking the car. He said that there's some fault in the car, and it can't be repaired now. He made me sign the application to cancel the RC book & crush the car. Okay then. - Okay. People always come looking for something, only after it's sold. Stan the car. - Yes, sir. Sudhi.. - Sir.. It's an ad that came on Manorama newspaper on the last Saturday of last January. That a black colour Ford lkon car is for sale. Trace all the calls that came to that landline number that day. The number of the person we're looking for, would be among them. I need details of numbers from which calls are not made regularly. Okay, sir. I'll send it. Why did he ask us to come here? You know him, right? He said it's urgent and asked us to come here quickly. The people who killed Stella, will execute a similar accident, tomorrow How? Sudhi had collected the phone details of the lady who took Stella to the hospital, after the accident. In the phone with that IMEI number, a new sim card is used, every single time. According to the date and tower location in the call list given by Sudhi, whenever a new sim card has been inserted on that phone, an accident has happened in the next 48 hours. That means? That means... Within the next 48 hours, an accident similarto Stella's would happen somewhere. We should trace them immediately. Isn't it easy to find that car? I made an attempt in that route in the morning. After every accident, they have used second hand cars to take people to the hospital. Once they use it, they will get a written request from the owner to get it crushed. In the forthcoming accident, they will be using a fresh car. They had contacted the owner of the car in which they took Stella, seeing a newspaper advertisement. Sudhi has traced that address. It's an apartment. Riverdale. That's the only loophole we have so far. I've sent Nair with the sketch made by Rajesh. Nair knows the security guard ofthat apartment. Then... Why don't we tell the SP and initiate the arrest? The case won't stand, Rag havan. Even if we catch them, we have no evidence to prove why they did it. Then why... Yes, Nair. Tell me. Got it? I'll come there now. Com e. Okay then. See you. Sir... Sir, it's the same person. 2 days back, he had bought an old Ambassador car. A black colour car. All of you should wait here. Don't go anywhere. Inform me as soon as they come out. Follow them. Nair, you were here? - I was here. What's the status? - I've got the camera you asked for. Hand this over to Advocate Srinivasan at 9 AM tomorrow The number is written on it. This one, to the SP. Don't forget it, at any cost. Okay. No problem, right? Would they have known that we're watching them? Hold it. Keep it. For a confidence. He leads me in paths of righteousness for his name's sake. Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil, foryou are with me your rod and your staff, they comfort me. You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. What happened? - Nothing. They haven't come out yet. Aren't you coming? I'll go to the Church and come afterthat. Siddique! Siddique! They are coming out. Call Joseph. Start the car. - Okay. Drive! Followthem! He is not picking up. What happened? What is it, Pathrose? We will miss them! He is not picking up. Good morning, sir. - Morning. Good morning, sir. Writ petition 510/2018. Yes, Mr. Srinivasan. I am forthe petitioners, Milord! Joseph, a retired police officer, has revealed truths that would shock the world, connected to a private investigation on his wife's death. I am presenting the documents of the truths he found out, before the Honourable Court. From the initial investigation of Stella's death itself, I had realized that it was a murder. I went to Peter's house to find out if Stella had any kind ofthreats or problems. I did an investigation to find out ifthere was any connection, between Stella's death and her treatment in the hospital. I couldn't find anything unnatural. Since my wife and daughter had a brain death in the same hospital, I felt thatl should investigate my daughter's death as well, for a clarity. The girl who accepted my daughter's heantransplant; despite her living in a surrounding that may cause infections, and working hard without taking medicines correctly, she lived this long. I had a suspicion about that. That suspicion led me to my friend who's a cardiology doctor. Sister, give this to the pharmacy. - Okay, Doctor. You both can wait outside. I'll buy the medicines and come. - Okay, sir. Come, dear. I think your suspicion is right. Her heart is still in the same condition it was, before her surgery. Something has happened. Some hoax has happened. I'm wondering how that girl is still alive. Government has implemented schemes like 'Mrithasanjeevani', to avoid crimes that may happen in organ transplantation surgeries. But... it's the same seniority list that has become the reason for the rise in such crimes. For example, if a person who has been injured badly on his head is brought to the hospital, the hospital authorities perform all the tests for organ donation very quickly, and check whether they cross match with the Mrithasanjivani list. If there are people in other hospitals, whose organs match those ofthe injured person in the Mrithasanjeevani list, they would cause a brain death forthe injured person. That maybe through medicines, or by delaying the treatment. Why do they do that? Ifthey hold the injured personthere for one month and give treatment, they would get only 10 Lakhs, maximum. Instead, if a brain death happens, through organ transplantation, what happens in 4-5 hospitals, is a business of almost 1.5 Crores. We've always considered such news to be like movie plots. But by investigating the death of his daughter which was caused by delayed treatment, and the death of his wife, caused through a well-planned small accident that led to an organized brain death, what Joseph has given to the society, are shocking and horrifying revelations about... the organized crime syndicate in the medical field. According to the Government list, the girl from Alappuzha who was supposed to receive my daughter's hean, hadn't received it. Even though the surgery happened, that girl's hean was not transplanted. To know what happened to my daughter's organs, I needed the admission list of that hospital around the dates ofthe surgery, medicine prescriptions, the patienfs case sheet, etc. These are stored digitally in major hospitals. To find that, I sought Sudhi's help. Isn't that Sudhi? In the name of a fake bomb threat investigation, Sudhi got into the hospital. As you asked for, the case sheets ofthose days, the details of that operation, and the prescriptions of medicines given to patients, and the detailed billing from the pharmacy, I have copied all that into this hard disk. There's a separate network between multi-specialty hospitals. I've hacked it. So... you can know every update that they make there, sitting here. The day my daughter died, that is, the day the surgery of Renuka from Alappuzha happened, I found out from the records that the heart operation of a foreign girl called Anna, happened in the same hospital, on the same day. In the prescription in Anna's case sheet, there were medicines given to patients who just had an organ transplantation. It was 15 days after Diana had the injury, that Anna reached India, and got admitted inthis hospital. Claiming that it was being done forthe girl from Alappuzha, Joseph's daughter's hean was transplanted to Anna. The day the girl from Alappuzha came first on the Government's Mrithasanjeevani list, It was on the same day, that the hospital claims that Joseph's daughter's brain death happened. All these are mutually connected, Milord! I suddenly felt like checking the hospital network Sudhi told me about. That really shocked me. In that, there were records of tests conducted for organ transplantation, on each patient who came to the hospitals in this network, with minor diseases. Sorted according to each blood group, the details of people who had accidents, were being cross-matched automatically, with people who required organs on the Mrithasanjeevani list. I understood that there was an organized crime going on in this field. In this time period, I sawthat the details ofthose who had a brain death, were being cross-matched with the Mrithasanjeevani list. There was a requirement of a heart with the rare blood group, AB negative. I copied the details ofthat patient who needed a transplantation. Because, my blood group is also AB negative. When I also conducted similartests, and cross matched its results with the details ofthe one who needed the organ, I saw that it was a perfect match. Just so that my details would be entered in this hospital, I orchestrated a suicide drama, without informing even my friends. As I had expected, my details for organ transplantation were uploaded to this network from the hospital, and were cross-matched. Ever since I realized that my heart matches that patient's requirement, it was confirmed that I'm going to be their next victim. I realized thatthey were observing me. I organized ideal situations forthem to attack me, through my daily routine. I found out from this network that the person who had my same blood group on the Mrithasanjivani seniority list, had been admitted to the hospital. Ever since he reached first on the seniority list, I waited forthe phones of the people who were planning to attack me, to become active. Sir, a new sim has been inserted to that lady's mobile. Since I wanted myself to be their only victim, and since I wanted their plan to succeed without any obstacles, I avoided my friends deliberately. Closing all the loopholes, with precise evidence, to bring them in front of the law, I decided to make them recreate that crime. Sir, I will have an accident this morning. Ifl die, my organs would be donated. My hean would be taken as if it is for a person on the Mrithasanjivani list, at City hospital. But it will reach there for someone else. 24 hours after the surgery is completed, you should investigate about this, and bring the culprits before the law, with scientific evidence. I'm giving my own body as evidence, so that there's no lack of any kind of evidence in the coun. Joseph is a martyr. Every single one of Joseph's deductions were true. If one of us gets a kidney or hean transplant here, what's the guarantee for that? We have to trust what the hospital and the doctors tell us. That's all! The patient who apparently got a heart transplant, has not received Joseph's hean. This has been proved from the examination of expert doctors. It has also been confirmed that his heart was given to a foreigner instead. It's true that the local police has registered a case. And begun the investigation. But since such crimes are spread all overthe country, I humbly requestthis Counto order a thorough CBI investigation on the accidents that happened earlier similarto this case. By sacrificing his own life to bring the Court's attention... to a grave crime that is affecting the society, the effons taken by the retired police officerJoseph, are appreciated by this Court. This Coun orders the CBI to investigate... all the brain deaths that has happened in Kerala. QH@§@@[HJD§ flmfimahmms the inclusion of police forensic surgeons in the doctors' panel, to confirm the brain death of people who had accidents, the mandatory video recording of the organ transplant surgery, the conduction of mandatory DNAtests on the organs during postmortem, whenever a person who has gone through an organ transplant surgery dies, and the handing over of all these videos to Sub Divisional Magistrates.
