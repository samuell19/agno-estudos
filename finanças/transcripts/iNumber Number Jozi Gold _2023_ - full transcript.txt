[baby crying] This... is not gold. It's an iron called pyrite. - Fools Gold. - [traffic noises outside] [sighs deeply] [police siren blaring] [Brigadier] Gentlemen, you know what they say? "The peach that is delicious, is tasty, that is sweet, is the one, that has worms." Therefore, the Hyena Man will be released. - Why? - Why? Don't ask me why. Lack of evidence. That's why. I'm telling you we have footage of him taking the money. Hey! All you can see in that footage, is a cop trying to shoot and kill the accused, after this one was deceived by a big bag. Full of iron-pyrites-what-what, worthless rocks! Do you know how I got into this position? Youngest Brigadier in this building. And female. I see you that you think I dropped my panties. Not me. I... have the General right here. Me and no one else is taking care of his pockets. [laughing] Yes. This gold, I promised him a share. Now, I must pay from my own pocket. My own money or else I'm out on the streets. Do you see how you're costing me? Hmm? Seriously, do you see? It's been so long, my friends. So long... that I've been trying to get you an upgrade. Listen to me... it's for your own good. Hmm? [scoffs] But wait... I don't want to, woman. Well, in that case, Go to the basement. - Basement? - Now! [Shoes] With that old man Van Zyl? - [Chili grunts] - [Brigadier] To learn your lesson, with that "Black Danger". I'm not working with that Boer. Understood? If you're telling me you don't want to go down to the basement, - there's the door. - [tense music plays] - It's wide open. - [siren blaring in distance] [police badge slaps on the table] I'm out. Don't worry, Brigadier. I'll talk to him. Okay? - Hey, Chili. - What? - What? - What are you doing, my brother? That woman is sick. Hey brother, she's just doing her job, man. - What's the matter with you? - Wake up, man! What's wrong with you? Brother, I have kids. Please consider that my brother. I have mouths to feed. From now on, I'm no longer a cop. We achieve fuck all. - Chili. - [mmh] Moshoeshoe. Ma'am? Without that man out there, you are useless shoes.

Do you know them? - Yes. Yes! - Do you know them? Tell me one. - Yes, boy. - Don't steal. But what happens, - if they steal from you first? - [boy chuckles] Wow! Mmmh! Huh? Another one? - Yes, boy. - Don't sleep with your neighbor's wife. [children laughing] Then what happens... if her husband is deceased? Huh? Hmm? One more. Yes, boy. Do not kill. Do not kill. [Chili] That's bullshit! [children in chorus] Chili. God said, "Kill the Amalekites. Man, woman, infant and child. Kill them all!" [Priest] Context, Chili. Context. What about the fifth commandment? - Honor your parents. - [boys] No! Did they honor us? - Mine abandoned me! - They left me on the streets! I was born in a toilet. Why? - Is that respect? - [boys] No! Order. - Did they respect us? - Order! - Order! - Did they respect us? Give us moment. I need to speak to Chili. Be strong. You hear me? Alright. This building is dilapidated Look at the ceiling there. [Chili] Maybe you should get a new place. - [Priest] Get a new place? - [Chili] Mmm. [Priest] How? How will I pay for it? I do not get the money from the Council anymore. These people are corrupt. And I owe the bank a lot of money. - [Chili] How much? - [Priest] 15 grand a month for ten years. [Chili whistles] I'm going to close this place. - Really? - Yeah. What about the kids? [children playing in the background] I got a call from Shoes. [Chili mutters] Here we go. He said that you're resigning. - Chili? - Yeah? - Maybe I could work here, with the kids. - [children chattering in background] Uh-uh. - You're a bad influence. - Why? I want to show you something. - What now? - Come. Here. Do you remember this picture? You and Shoes, five years old. You went swimming. Hmm? You were drowning. And this fool was trying to save you, but he couldn't swim either. When I heard your screaming I came running. You never thanked him. Listen, Uncle. I definitely know I made the right choice. - We're making no impact. - [laughs] You became a cop to make an impact? - Yes, sure. - Don't talk nonsense to me. To make a difference for these kids. You became a cop, Chili because you wanted these kids to see you. Walk the streets like a big shot. [mimic gunshot] "There goes Chili." No, man. Come on. Do you know who keeps you under control? It's Shoes. Without him, you'd be in jail right now or dead. - You want to make an impact? - Sure. Then show these kids the power of love and friendship. Show them that you care. When they see you two as cops together, that is the impact. [children playing in distance] [kid yells] Chili! [sad music playing] [phone keypads clicking] [mobile phone pings] - [dogs barking in distance] - [door clicks open] Hey, man. I just got your message to come out. Do you want to work with this Boer? How will I work without you? Huh? [clicks tongue] - You should go. - [wistful music plays] Thank you for saving my life. I love you, boy. [chortles] [police siren blaring] [Jonga growls] [tires screech] [Jonga growls fiercely] [Jonga whimpers] [Van Zyl] Aaah! The lady of 12 ambitions and thirteen accidents. - [men laughing] - [Brigadier] Hey, don't just open your mouth and talk, Van Zyl. I'm not your maid. We've discussed this. I have no use for these men. [Brigadier laughing] No use? You know, Van Zyl, at the age of 16, I was forced into exile. - Oh, please. - [Brigadier] 11 years, I used a White man's face as my shooting target. [Van Zyl] Probably missed. When I was given control and power over this Afrikaner graveyard... Yes, graveyard. I was far from ecstatic. But then, I took a look at your conviction rate. 100%. - Correct. - [Brigadier]Yes, but it's been six months. [Brigadier] Six months! And if you, have nothing for me, it means I, have nothing for the General. You know I don't give kickbacks. Who said anything about kickbacks? Huh? Who? What I want to know is where the hell are my fucking arrests? How many targets has this gang hit, huh? Answer me. - We are building a case. - Ah, come on, Van Zyl. You? You're building nothing. Look at you. Because you light-skinned idiots sitting here, will never, ever know anything about a dark-skinned gang. [Chili chuckling] I choose my own team. [laughing] Let me be very clear. There is no floor lower, than basement. You are never going to convince me. Colonel? Brigadier? - Lieutenant. - [Brigadier] Yes, Shoes? Chili and I, we know this crew. The Gold Gang, famous in the township for giving to the people. Word on the street is that they heist gold, and then they disappear, like ghosts. Even the gold, is not seen again. Your point, Lieutenant? You have suspects, but always an alibi, right? - We can help you. - [Colonel chuckles] We can help you catch them in the act. Okay. So what does the street say about these? Krugerrands. Untraceable gold coins, hmm, - showing up all over Alex township. - [coins jiggling] So... the gang is, making these out of the gold they steal? How would they do that, Lieutenant? [men laughing] The thug, - Jonga. - [tense music playing] - Is he one of them? - Who? Him. The Hyena Man. Yes, I believe where he takes his gold to be refined, the gang takes it there too. Yeah, this gang hangs at this gangster club. We call it the Alibi Club. Gangsters commit crime, same night they go there to make alibis for each other. On what night did you say these targets were hit? Monday. Why? - Open Monday. - What? Open Monday. That's the only night the club is open. [clapping] Can you see? Just five minutes with us Blacks and more progress than the last 40 years. Cause I'm adding Apartheid. Oh, for fucks sakes. [Shoes] Colonel. Chili is well known at this club. He can infiltrate this gang easily. [man 6] Join them for iNumber Number. - Yes. - iNumber Number? A job. A heist. - Then, we take them red-handed. - [tense music continues} - [upbeat music playing] - [club chatter] [Gert] Tracker is active, Colonel. - Thank you, Gert. - [sniffs, sighs] [van doors click shut] Lieutenant. Sit with me. I heard about your partner. I know what people say about Chili but he's our number one undercover. Piet's police coffee. Coke. Grandpa headache powders. Yes, with a touch of brandy. That's it. You know, I used to have a corner office. Top floor. And when Apartheid ended, they sent me down. The basement. All the Black officers I trained, promoted over me. One of them is sitting in my corner office right now. Mmmh! You think it's fair? But I never resigned. [drink fizzes] I worked harder. They gave me the impossible cases. I solved them. That's my legacy, Moshoeshoe. Perfect record. It's all I have. We won't let you down, Sir. [club chatter upturns] [club chatters heard from the audio wires] - What are you doing, man? - What's wrong with you? Look at me. What is wrong with you? What will you do? What are you gonna do about it? Huh? - Hey get your hands off me. - Hey, what are you doing? What are you doing, anyway? And why are you grabbing me like that, man? Let go of me, now. [whispers indistinctly] [glass shatters] What the hell is he doing? He's getting their attention, Sir. Oh! Makaveli the Don. Tupac Shakuur. [cork popping] Last number. You see what I see? That piece of shit. Yes, in the right outfit, for sure. [sign language] Maybe he could work. Hmm! Let's test him. What you're doing is dumb. Aarrgh! My dog, touch my blood. Big man. Original gangster. Who's this fool? They call me Seeng. Standing over there, my sister, Dimo. My brother, Dikeledi. And you? What's your name? Chili. I'm Chili Ngcobo. Why did he use his real name? Less lies. Less ass-covering. Hey, my dog. I feel like the dog of all dogs. A real baller. Eh... Actually, I feel better than everyone. You're a big shot, right? - You throw money out of the window not me. - [Seeng sniggers] My brother. [Dimo] We're spreading love. That's all. [signing] We're wasting our time with this guy. You call it from the air? Eh? Traffic cop? - [Seeng] Big mouth. - You have a big mouth. My brother is Deaf. He might be Deaf, but he sees. I want to see you give this money to the needy, not these greedy crooks in the streets. Let me show you something. You see these kids? Kajama Home for abandoned children. Next time you want to show off, help these children! You grew up there? Yeah. My mother abandoned me. My old man didn't give a fuck about me. I grew up on the streets. [snaps fingers] He's got them. Where do you get your money? He wants to know if you're a dog or a fat cat? Come, let's drink. We don't drink. This is non-alcoholic, brother. [whistles] While fools drink, the clever get rich. Let it burn. Burn them all! - What did she say? - [shoes scoffs] She said, "When fools drink, the clever get rich." [Van Zyl] Ah, they're gonna do a job tonight. We've got them. Put the task team on standby. [man 7] On it, Colonel. Go! - [Colonel] Go, go! - Men, hurry up. [Colonel] Do your best! [upbeat music playing] [indistinct chatters] Let's go. [music heard from the audio connection] Sir, please stop it. [excited] [Shoes chuckles] Come on, Sir. Men, we must focus. [Colonel] Yes shoes [laughs] that's how we do it, men. [Van Zyl] No, no, no. We must... [in Tswana] Come on, sir. [indistinct chatters] [Man excited sounds] [Van Zyl laughs] - [music interrupted] - [microphone feedback] [Van Zyl] Hey! Whoa! [crowd yell in disappointment] Get lost! Hey, you broke bastard! - Asshole. Come here. - [whipping, swooshing] You're poking a snake in it's hole. Huh? I mean, who do you think you are? - Do you know who I am? - [crowd murmuring] [indistinct chatters] [whipping, whooshing] - [both grunting] - [crowd cheering] [voice in crowd] Yes! [glass shattering] Chili? Chili, we have to go. [men shouting] [man groans] [Dimo] Let's go! [commotion increases] [Colonel] They're moving. [notification tone dings] [Dimo panting] [Dimo] Come! Let's go. [Dimo] Hurry up! [dog barking] - [panting] - [traffic noises] - What's going on? Huh? [panting] - [dog barking in distance] Who are you? Are you some kind of gangster? - [sighs] - [car horn honks] Police. What? - [signing] He's a cop. - [traffic noises] He's reeling them in. Fucking hope so. Bastards. But not anymore. Not anymore. Guys, I promise you, bullshit procedure and corruption made me quit. But you. You... you are the gangsters. You need me. You need a guy like me. Why is that? Why? I know how cops operate. I know how they think, man. Dimo. - [signing] What do you think? - [dog barking in distance] - [sighs] - [dramatic music continues] My brother trusts you. Listen, we're not gangsters. There's a purpose to what we do. We've dedicated our lives to it. You can't come in here and mess that up. Understood? Sure. Okay, listen to me now. Take off all your shiny cloth. Tonight... you prove yourself. Listen, guys. He's in. - [tense music playing] - [traffic noises in distance] [Van Zyl groans] [flames burning] [Moshoeshoe] We've lost comms. Colonel, the tracker is also off. [Van Zyl] Where are they? Oh there. There! [Van Zyl] Come on, follow them! Go! [people cheering] [engine revs] [Van Zyl] Where the hell are they? Must be a jewelry store in the mall. [upbeat music playing] There! [Dimo] This crooked jeweler, works people in the township like slaves. They make fake jewelries and he sells them for a fortune. And he pays them a fuck all for it. - [clicks] - [unlocks the door] [Seeng] Five minutes. - Fuck. - [alarm beeping] [Dimo] These people, you know them? [man] Please. [Dimo] Open it. Take everything that is gold. Don't leave anything behind. Let's go! There! [jewelry clinking] - [chuckles] - [upbeat music playing] [Dimo] Shit! Cops! Let's go! - [Van Zyl] Go, go! No shooting. - [dramatic music playing] [Chili] Go! [Van Zyl] Go! Go! Go! - [Van Zyl] Gert! - [Shoes] Clear. [Van Zyl] Fuck. [Dimo] Give him your clothes. Goddamn it! Back to the van. Let's go to the van! [Van Zyl] Do you have any leads, Fanie? [Dimo] Small hills give birth to mountains. [yelling] Find them! [iNumber Number theme song playing] [theme song continues] [engine whizzing] [smooth Jazz music playing] [Dimo] Yeah! [Seeng, chili cheering, whooping] Yeah! Yes! [screaming and shouting] [Dino whooping] [laughing, whooping] [laughing] - [Dino] That's the one. - [laughing] [dramatic tune playing] [fire sizzling] [Chili] What is this place? Come this side. This is where we live. This is our crib. You guys are too clever. Huh? [Chili] And this? [Dimo] Come. [hot flames crackling] [mother] My children, I ask from the fires of hell, what the devil is this? Who is this lousy person? Answer! [Dimo] Mom, [In English] please before you get angry, take a good look at him. [signing] Do you see what I see? Mom, we'll finally be able to do this. [Van Zyl] Why did he dump his microphone and his tracker? Don't even answer that. Bastard. Lieutenant, [sighs] - [police siren] - [Van Zyl sighs] - your friend has turned. - No, Colonel. Don't use a short stick to scratch a big lion's balls. I know what you're doing. [jewelry clinking] What are we doing here? This is where we melt the gold. This old lady presses it into sheets of gold. And then, we cut it. Feed it into this beauty. 1970 SA mint. Then we make coins. [machine whirls then locks] Can you believe it was sold for scrap? Bloody idiots. We mint Krugerrands. 100% genuine. [chuckling] - [Dimo] That coin is legal tender. - The money is legit. You can walk into a gold exchange with one of these bad boys [Seeng] and they'll give you 20 grand, cash. No questions asked. [chuckling] But what I'd really want to know, what's going on with my face? Hmm? - You're protecting him. - No, Sir. Lieutenant, there's a culture of crime in this country, and your friend is feeding it. - I'll go to his place. - You do that, Lieutenant. And you find out what this gang is planning or I will arrest your friend. And I'll lay charges against you. [Dimo] Lerotholi Thoriso I, dictator of Lesotho, our home country. This is his son, Lerotholi Thoriso II. We call him Thor. Huh! Listen, I've met him. You're the same height. You even have the same swagger. If we use some pillows to give you a tummy, then add a cap - and sunglasses. You'll look the same. - And then? [Mom] Thor took control of our country's only gold mine. and promised to share the wealth with the people. Instead, he brings the raw gold to South Africa, for his own gain. The thief comes to steal and to waste it. [signing] Our plan is perfect. We will succeed. - [phone ringing] - Come on come on. Come on, man. Come on, Chili. Chili, come on. [sniffing][panting] So how long have you guys been thieves? [Seeng] Uh-uh [Seeng] We're not thieves, we're activists. - [Chili] Oh! - [Seeng] Yes My father started a resistance against the dictator. We left Lesotho after they murdered him. One day, I will avenge my late husband. Our mother is the best gold coin forger in all of Africa. She taught us the three most important things in life. Number one, take from the fat. You hear. - Number two. - Huh! [singing] Party like a rockstar. - [Seeng] Yes, yes, yes. - [Dimo] Oh yes! - Number three. [whistles] - Yes. - Give back. - Give back. You've seen our sacred space. Don't disappoint me. - [Mother] Amen. - [Dimo] Amen. [Seeng] Amen. [phone dialing tone] [groans softly] [sad music playing] My brothers give their share to NGOs and orphanages. And, this is my way of giving back. Let's go. [coin clinks] [laughing] This one is for you. So tell the truth... You're stealing this dictator's gold? Last year, he brought in over a ton. [chuckles] And you... can handle that? - I don't have to. - [Chili] Oh... They bring it to the Joburg Gold Refinery. They turn it into gold bars worth 500 million. That's what we want. Jozi Gold? [clicks tongue] You know it's impossible to break in there. - [Chili mmh] - [Dimo mmh] We're going to take that gold. - Return it back to Lesotho. - [birds chirping, cawing] [gym metals clinking] So this is where you hide, mister? [pants] Not here, man! - Come. - [dog barking in distance] Listen, this gang, steals gold, turns it into Krugerrands, then gives them away. They live in a scrapyard. They're thieves, these people. No, man. Bullshit! They're doing something good. When have we made any impact? Listen. The home we grew up in, is in trouble. Father Kajama only has six months and then he has to close. I want to buy them a new home. That thing is going to cost a lot. Okay, sure. This gang, they are busy planning the biggest job of all jobs. The mother of all heists. That could help us. Brother. Help me, Shoes so I can help them. Let's help the home that raised us. Shoes, just do one thing for me please. - Police stays out of this. - [tense music plays] - Let's go. - [Shoes breathing heavily] [Chili] Give me this one. Let's go. Give me this one. [baby crying] [woman] What if he gets caught? Won't he snitch on you? [Shoes] That man is my brother. We've come a long way. - He wouldn't do that to me now. - [baby whines] [woman] Look, Promise me one thing. As our kids are growing up, I don't want Chili to be their role model. - That must be you. - [baby whines] [door clicks open] [Dimo] Come in. There's someone I want you to meet. He has inside contacts at the refinery. They know when the gold is coming from Lesotho. Yes, sure. We need that. [hot fire sizzles] It's you, thug! [Hyena Man groaning] [metal rod clinking] What the hell?! - [Hyena Man groaning] - [Chili screams] [Dimo] What are you doing? That bastard ripped me off a 100 grand! Sold me fake gold! - He's a cop! - I was a cop! I was a cop! You can't trust this man. - [Chili] Let me finish him! - [Dimo] Chili!! - Chili, listen for a second. - Let me finish him! Listen, we need him. Okay? He knows when the gold is coming. - [Hyena man groans] - [Dimo] Chili! We need him, okay? Where is my hyena? - What? - Chili. I'm not talking, until Jonga, is brought back here. [groans] [suspenseful music playing] [Jonga whimpers] [gasps in fear] [Jonga growls] [guitar strings playing] [children playing in the background] - [cage opening] - [Jonga growls] [door bangs] Thank you, brother. So, what now? You're working with the enemy? Fuck, no. - I'm not. - Then what? - [car hooting] - [indistinct chatters] Jozi Gold Refinery. Jo'burg Gold? That corrupt place, allows dictators with their gold through the back door. This conflict gold is stolen from their people. This gang wants to give it back to them. That's their impact. And this? It's a tranquillizer. You'll need it. [car engine] [bottles clinking] Johannesburg Gold Refinery. Jozi Gold. Well done, Lieutenant. When? Hmm? Shoes, you need to find out. [keyboard clinking] [Dimo] On the day they refine the gold, he stays here, Gold Reef City Hotel and Casino. [Seeng] That's where we make the swap. Then we return to the refinery. Get "your" gold, jump on the plane, fly to Lesotho. You mean we will be in the dictator's plane? Do you have a better idea? Look, the dictator of Lesotho. [Shoes] He nationalized the only gold mine in the country. Very controversial. He also has a private jet. Lanseria Airport, landing request in two weeks. [signing] We must be invisible. They wont see us coming. I got you. [Brigadier sighs] [sniffs] Listen here. Don't you dare mess with me. Do you hear me? I owe you nothing. You would be rotting in jail, but who helped you. - [chains unlocking] - [Jonga growling] [baby cooing] Get out of my face. You disgust me. Keep quiet. You have no idea what I can do. The gang's best chance is to hit this refinery armored vehicle. My team will secure the airport. [Police] Come! We have no time. Let's go! [Van Zyl] My team will follow the gold. All right men let's go! I've put a chopper in the air. They don't stand a chance. - It's time. - [upbeat music playing] Good day, gentlemen. You are welcome. Come on! Come, come. Move! Move! There we go. Yes. The gold is on the move. Let's go. Copy that, Captain. - Gold is on the move. - [Van Zyl] Good. [in Afrikaans] Fanie, Ops. - Gert and I are on the target's tail. - [Van Zyl] Roger, Major. [car siren] [Helicopter sounds] [tires screeches] Casino! [Shoes] They are going to hit the armored vehicle when it leaves. Naturally. They want the certified gold bullion. [police] Ops, Fanie. The dictator is leaving the refinery. Should we follow them? Lieutenant, find out where they're going. Major, follow in one car. Gold Reef City. - Dictators love to gamble. - [upbeat music continues] Hey man, let us inside so we can see what's happening. Shit. Okay. Welcome, sir. We hope your room meets your expectations. Enjoy your stay. [sprinkler nozzle] [men grunt] - [knives grinding] - [upbeat music continues] - Lieutenant. Colonel. - Yeah? So I managed to hack the cameras for the casino. Here. - We'll see. - There. Pull that up. [sniffs] We've lost him, Lieutenant. [whistles] And now? Hey, my sister. You're not allowed to get in. [man groans in pain] - [cheering] - [upbeat music plays] [police siren blaring] [police] Fanie, the dictator is on the move. - Major, follow them. - [dramatic music plays] [Shoes] Freeze that. Colonel. Look, Colonel. [Fane] We're following. Fuck it. Shit. Get that finger now. [Fane] Colonel, the limo is back. Gert, get me a close up of the dictator. Now! - [grunts] - [door bangs] - That is Chili. - [Colonel] What?! How the fuck did that happen?! The swap was made at the hotel. How do you know that? The Hyena Man is my informant. - Your informant? - Yes. You see all these men here? They're my people. Welcome back, Sir. Here are your certificates of authentication. As we speak, the plane has already been taken. [police] Go, go, go! All my men are ready to pounce in. Go, go, go! Each of these is worth ten million. When that Chili, like a complacent fool that he is, gets on that plane, I'll grab him. Only him. You're going to steal the gold. I want to travel with my gold. He wants to travel with his gold. That gold, it's already stolen. Fuck that. Whoop! [sinister laughter] They're leaving the refinery. And we're right behind them. [Brigadier] Copy that. Keep your distance. When the van enters the airport, my team will take over. Copy that, Brigadier. Don't stress yourselves. Relax. If you behave yourselves, I might give you guys a piece. [police siren] Police coffee? [traffic noises] [police muffles] [helicopter whirring] [Fane] Hey! He's turning! He's turning! My dog! My dog! Go, go, go! All units, chopper. [captain] The van is changing direction. It's not going to the airport, over. What the fuck? No... - [phone ringing] - [chuckles] Fuck! Captain, get off that fucking plane and chase the gold! [Captain] Yes, Brigadier. Let's go! All units, chopper. The refinery armored vehicle has entered a warehouse. CBD, Carr Street. CBD, Carr Street. Over. Check the street. Fanie, van. We're at the warehouse.

Fuck, man! - [Van Zyl whimpering] What was that? - Gosh! There's no gold in the armored vehicle. Bastards! They made a swap. They must be somewhere around here. [grants] Shit! Where's the gang? Those dogs are gone. Shit! Those motherfuckers! It's impossible. [yelling] Fuck, man! Fuck! [van Zyl groans in pain] Fuck. [tyre squeeling] Shit.

He's not going anywhere without his hyena. He's married to it. Let's go. - Where to? - I know where he is. Don't make me shoot! Do it! [Dimo] Chili! [Van Zyl continues to groan] Hey, hey.

[groans] [groaning increases] [gun cocks] Hey dude, what are we doing here? Let's finish this. Let's finish this. I'm done with this. Do whatever you want to do. I'm staying right here with the gold. [gold clinking] [upbeat music] Jonga, it's feeding time. - Go! - [Jonga squeals] [Hyena man groans] [gun shots] - [glass shatters] - [whimpering] [continues to whimper] You missed, asshole!

[Dimo sobbing] - [somber music continues] - [Dikeledi sighs] My friend. [Chili] My friend. [car engine ignites] [vehicle accelerates away] [Chili exhales loudly] [wistful music plays] What do you owe me? When this goes to court, you're gonna need backup. [Van Zyl groaning] Van Zyl knows what you did. If you carry on like this, you're going to end up in prison. We made an impact today. Hey? Today we made an impact. - [Chili chuckles] - [Shoes laughs] Hey [giggles] [grunts] [sighs] - [Chili chuckles] - [lively music playing] [gold thuds on the table] [children playing in the background] [children] Shoes, Shoes!
