During the flight, you can hear Mr. Drucker's phone calls. It could be anything, since major mergers, even inside information of their sports teams. Regardless, we have the legal obligation to protect these things. What does this guy think? Is he the president? No, he considers it to be the second most important person in the world. Ah! Ooh, that's a big deal. All for a day of snowboarding? The blood test was agony. Seriously, I was screaming. She's just joking. Do not worry about it. This really does not hurt. Just press your thumb here. Right here? Yes, just like that. All done. I did not feel anything. You need to check your vision. Put the chin here. Look ahead. Right here? Mm-hmm. You test blood, to all your pilots? Pilots, drivers, assistants. Anyone who comes in contact, with Mr. Drucker. Hmm. All right, I press here? Yes. Is here. "PAST" Perfect, you two. After that, I'm going to the city. test a boss and two waiters. The pink copy of the contract is yours. I'll take the rest. Here we go. Have a good flight, gentlemen. Ta ta You know, I could take care of Drucker. This way, you could have time to get Oliver cloned. I'm not getting the cloned dog. I'll just take a look. I know, but once that you see, will say yes. I know deep down. You are sweet. Oh... They specifically asked for Adam by name. I know what it specifically means. I also know that the bodyguards can not tell the difference. They never received our names. Oh! That's true. I know that I go around a lot. But when it comes to flying, You know I'm serious. I could do this. Go enjoy your birthday. If you want to be me, try to act a bit more virile. Yes. Chest. It's ok? Chest. Stomach. There you are. Stomach. All right. Call me the house speaker. I want the speaker there.

Pete Hume talks a lot about you. He says that You know the mountains like no one else. Thank you. This is probably true for all except my partner, thank you. I'm looking forward to it. So, do we all define? Yes sir. We position our staff monitoring the rescue beacons... we do not need the details. All right! Your favorite snowboard is behind your seat, sir. Dave, look, we've done a lot. money for his campaign, not to mention what I paid for, to your law firm, So I'm counting on you. It's ok? Will you call me the orator? Good. So, Sally, who's next? All right, put it on. We just arrived You own the roadrunners, right? Hey, buddy, wake up. Wake up! We're here. Forest shopping. Oh, I was asleep. Welcome to the mall, of the forest. Over 1200 stores to serve you. Food court, at ground level. Stop cloning. Say no to RePeat. Stop cloning. Say no to RePeat. Stop cloning. Save your soul, man. God does not want you to go there. So God should not, have killed my dog. Atheist. Stop cloning. Say no to RePeat. We can clone your loved one. four-legged in just a few hours. How can we do that? It all starts with growth of blanks, drones stripped animals of all D.N.A. characteristics, in embryo tanks in the RePet factory. In the second stage, your animal D.N.A., is extracted from a wick of skin or drop of blood... and then infused into a level in the white space. In the final stage, using the process synchronization patented by RePet, all your pet's thoughts pet, memories and instincts... are transplanted without pain, through the optic nerve. Still can not decide, right? You lost a dog, right? Yes, daughter. Oh, that's disgusting. What did you say, his name is again Oliver. Good... Oliver is, with luck. We are having a special this week, 20% discount. When did Oliver die? Someday this morning. This is perfect. We can still do a postmortem recording. But you have to act fast. Cecause there is only one window 12 hours in deceased brains. I have a problem, with all this idea. I mean, suppose the clones have no soul or are dangerous. Pets clone are so safe, how much real pets. More... they are insured. If it is so safe, then why is it, against the law to clone humans? Because the human brain is very complicated, to synchronize. Now you remember that one. experience they did, right? Yes. That's why that did not work. Now it's illegal to even try. But with pets, is a proven technology. Your RePet, Oliver, it will be exactly the same dog. He will know all the same tricks you taught him, where the bones are buried. He will not even know he's a clone. And did I mention it? They are insured. I do not care about insurance. I worry if I can trust my daughter, with a large animal with sharp teeth. We can make it smaller if you want, with softer teeth. You can? We can even coordinate the color to match, with your decorating scheme. sim-pals, the best friend that money you can buy. Let me think about it. Treat your children to a sim-pals today. I may be back. You will return. Your daughter will think, That you're the best dad. My little sister has two these and she loves them. Oh good. Let's fix the collar. There you are.

We know. There was a violation of the sixth day. One human was cloned. This human was you. We can help you. Then get him out! But you will have to come with us. Look, I do not know.

Someone does something about that damn doll! I have a boo-boo. Not!... This is crazy. Why does someone want to kill me? He got home first. Have you seen him. He did not see you. You're screwed. He's going to live the rest of his life. boring and will never be the wiser. Ah... Your wife and daughter will see you. and he together, they will be killed. Wow!! Oh shit! Not! Ah! Fuck, Wiley! Son of a bitch! This is crazy!... Stupid! Blast your tires this time! Oh shit! Oh shit! Fuck! Yes! Hey... Oho... That was spectacular. Oh... Oh, you son of a bitch. Hold my belt. It's ok. Oh, ah... You got me? Yes. A little more. Oh... Oh! Holy God, you son of a bitch! Let's get some people, down the river and look for this guy. Go get the bodies of Wiley and Talia, take them back to the lab. Weir's Clinic, stay away! Hello, I'm dr. Griffin Weir. Welcome to the new home of Installation of organ transplantation from Weir... thank you for visiting technologies of substitution. We are in the business of life. Dr. Weir, demonstrators claim cloning of human organs... will inevitably lead to cloning of whole human beings. This is not only illegal, but we are years away, ability to do so. But a human was cloned, for over ten years, doctor? And we all know the result of this bizarre experiment. If you remember, the supreme court ordered, that the clone was destroyed, and I think... that under the conditions, was the human thing to do. This led to laws against, human cloning... and retracted the course of the research for many years. Mr. Drucker? Mr. Drucker? You gave $ 100 million dollars... This is dr. Weir's night. Dr. Weir, it is true that you are trying to repeal the laws of the sixth day? Dr. Weir is interested. in medicine, not politics. Mr. Drucker, the demonstrators outside, claim that you administer, RePet at a loss... in order to soften people, even the idea of human cloning. Now! You know, we should not forget this is not too long ago... literally there was almost no more fish in the ocean. And half of the world's population a very real threat of hunger. Our cloning technology helped to change that. The extremists They do not like to admit... who would prefer the world to pass hunger than to eat cloned fish. So, instead, they continue to screaming about human cloning. Do you think the laws of human cloning should change? Suppose a boy ten-year-old is lying down, in a hospital bed, dying of liver cancer. Thanks to dr. The work of Weir, We can save this boy. Now, in the next bed, is another ten-year-old boy... whose parents love him as much. Only this child has, an inoperable brain tumor. Now you can not clone a brain. The only way to save it would clone the whole person. As you tell this kid's parents, Can we save the first boy? But the research that would have saved his son, this was not done, because of a law, which was approved by politicians scared a decade ago? So what does that mean? Enjoy the party. Thank you! It looked like you needed to rescue. Yes, Michael, I did. Thank you. Weir's Clinic, stay away! No research on DNA! Weir's Clinic, stay away! No research on DNA! No research on DNA! Hey Boss! Johnny! How's my tactician? I'd say I was feeling, like a million dollars except, I would hate to have a cut on payment. Do not remind me, okay? This was an unpleasant blow, that you took last week. Be careful, son. We do not we want you to be dead outside. Katherine? Are you alright? I'm just feeling... as I do not belong completely. No, no. But I am fine. I really am. No, you are not. I should call dr. Stevens? No, no, no. No, no. I just I exaggerated, that's all. I'm going to get a car to take you, For home, right? Thank you. Mr. Speaker, thank you very much. for coming. Champagne? That was, quite a speech. Did you hear that? I did not want to get carried away. His words meant too much for me. Do you see, by any chance, I have a child with an inoperable brain tumor. Oh my gosh! I'm so sorry, sir. It must have been in my subconscious, knowing that you were here, but I never wanted you to hear. No, no, it's okay. It gave me a lot to think about. In fact, this gave me a different from the whole subject. Mr. Speaker... I could offer you a glass of cognac, In my office upstairs? I was 50 years old, when Billy was born. I did not know if I wanted Another child so late. But now, I love him so much. If there was something, that we could do for Billy, only it was highly illegal, Would you consider that? Of course yes. This is the same type of hypothetical situation... No, no, do not answer so fast. You would be facing a minimal sentence 40 years if he is already out. But would he be healed? He would be exactly the same as it was before. Perfect health. He would never have who know what happened. But if the secret has already come out with the law the way it is now, he would be put to sleep, like a rabid dog. He would be destroyed like a horse with a broken leg. What if he never left? Or if the laws were changed one day? Then Billy would have nothing, with which to worry. "POLICE" Department 7 Please, I beg, go to my house. and take my wife and daughter. Because if I go back there, they'll kill both of them. You have made a police report completely different an hour ago. No I did not. According to that, you did. And them checked their fingerprint. This must have been the clone. Look... I know, which sounds crazy. I can hardly believe it in myself. Was your car stolen or not? Yes. So you reported it? No. It was me who took it. Did you steal your own car? Hello. I am your virtual lawyer indicated by the court. You do not need to answer. My client is officially being accused of car theft? I did not steal. It's mine. He claims, that the report was archived by your clone. I understand. Carrying the virtual psychiatrist. Oh, Mr. Gibson. What seems to be the problem? You want me to go through, for the whole thing now with him? You seem to be avoiding talk about your parents. Imagine, two turtles, who are walking through the desert... Ah shut up! "ADAM GIBSON MEDICAL ALERT" Psychiatric Patient Hmm. "Hmm" what? Will you help me? Clear. Transmitted medical alert. Waiting for data. Just wait here. I'll get it as soon as we have some news. Clones! He gave a good laugh, when he read the story. You know, he saw himself in your house tonight. What was our mistake, not his? Excuse me. He's in District Seven. You could rush Talia and Wiley, please? I'll need both. "INFUSION SUBJECT! Wiley, P "TALIA ELSWORTH" Damn! Son of a bitch! Piece of shit, Wiley. I'll kill him. Where is he? He's still cooking. Son of a bitch. I look like crap. Do you have any idea how much they cost? my hair treatments? How much Gibson knows now? He knows he's been cloned. He knows we're going to kill. anyone, to see them together. What is it? What? Drucker knows what you're talking about. about killing innocent people? Relax, it was just a threat. Of course we would never do that. Try to have a good night. You do your hair. I'm taking Wiley and Vincent. I have to stick to my damn ears again. The authorities blame, the latest strike, of Players in the USA, the main league, now entering, in his fourth year, in the absence of identification of the fans with both teams playing in the series. Shit. Sit down! Oh no. What is it now? It seems tight here where, the tires run over me. You got hit by two cars. and his chest was crushed. Exactly. No wonder, right? It's on your mind. Completely crushed, as in dead... How do you have a chest? totally new now. So how difficult is it to breathe? Tell you what. Because you Do not stay outside, relax? Fresh air will do you good. Hey, government officials reject the proposal openly. This is equivalent to an attempt by Microsoft to buy a union state. Never!... there will be such cooperation... But if he quit his medication, paranoid illusions come back. Very sad, because in others moments he seems almost rational. Mr. Gibson? Gibson! Gibson! You're dead. No, you're dead. Try to stay dead this time. "POLICE" Hank, it's me again. What the hell happened to you? I waited for more than half time at Kelly's. It's now seven and five. I'm going home, okay? Whoa, whoa. He is fine. He is fine. He is our associate. Gibson must have stunned him. Did you drop him? He looks dead to me, Doc. No, his wrist is strong. He will be on top and in back in no time. We're just taking him to the hospital. Easy, that's it. Whoa, whoa. Ah... Let us know, if you find Gibson. Home Sweet Home. Honey where are you? Hi, sugar. Hello my love. Are you working out?

It did not look like that. She looked happy. Oh, you have no idea, of what it feels like to see her with him. I should have killed that son of a bitch, when I had the chance. It could have been worse. It could have been someone else. At least she's not cheating... Oh... Hank! Do not move! Tripp. I'm not after you. Step away. Get away! Why did you do that? Do not do anything stupid now. This is as far as you go. Is that you, Hank? Oh... Hank Hey, Adam. Hank is sleeping on the floor again? That's so cute of you. In the six... on the sixth day, God created man. On the sixth day... on the sixth day, God created man. God created man on the sixth day. Why the hell you? killed my friend Hank Morgan was an abomination, to God. He was a clone. Hank was not a clone. The true Hank Morgan died this afternoon. I know why I killed him... so I could kill Drucker. Drucker is not dead. It would be on all the news. Open your eyes. Drucker is a clone. Dr Weir cloned Drucker. Dr. Weir cloned his friend. Dr. Weir cloned you. They found us. They found us. Shoot my head. What the hell are you talking about? We have people in Weir's lab. I know who they are. If they scan my brain, they will be killed. Shoot me! God forgive me. Is no one else dead? Who are you? IDENTITY. Required. Please use the biometric reader, to verify the ID... or the alarm will sound in 10 seconds. Ten, nine, eight, he shot my leg. Seven six six Son of a bitch! Four, three two, one, hold. Let's go. Accessed systems. Gibson, Gibson! Please select the destination. Shit! You will pay! Those they were brand-new boots! Dad, you're coming, for my recital, right? I never miss it, of his recitals. I love you. You are the greatest father. Unless your infection, by pseudomonas disappear, I fear that there is nothing, that we can do. And D.N.A. Scanning? It came with cystic fibrosis. Cystic fibrosis? What is impossible, considering, which is a childhood illness... and she would be dead for 30 years. We are running, scan again. No, I'll do it at the clinic. If you could give us a moment, please. Thank you very much. Honey, honey. We're transferring you To my clinic, okay? No. I'd like to stay here. No, but I can help you at the clinic. If you stay here, There's nothing I can do. I know honey. I'm going to die here. Yes. Katherine, please. Please, listen to me. Do not. Katherine died five years ago. The feelings I have They are not mine, they are hers. Oh Katherine, listen. Now do not do that. I need you so much. I need you. I'm not afraid, Griffin. I wanna die. My time has passed. My love. What should I do without you? What... You just water my flowers, all right? Thanks for visiting, technologies. We are in the business of life. Welcome to the new home, of the transplant facility of Weir's organs, technologies. Excuse me sir. I have to check this out. Oh sure. Feel free. But you may want to use that. Because? What's in here? Lower Intestines. It's for dr. Weir, he is doing, a study of a meat-eating virus. All right, you can open it. Just try not to breathe. It's all right. Continues. You're clean. Thank you. "KATHERINE WEIR" and D.N.A. Scanning? It came with cystic fibrosis. Of course it's impossible... whereas it is, a childhood illness. She should be dead 30 years ago. So we're running a new scan. No, I'll do it in my clinic. It's ok. You had five extra years. since you cloned me. I value that. Katherine, please. No, I'm not scared. I wanna die. My time has passed. "JOHNNY PHOENIX" Complete analysis of free cancer, Clone detected by the genome RePet New Salmon. "NOW ORGAN" Can I help you? No, I just dropped my pen. I'm all thumbs today. Thank you. Are you going to cut it? This is driving me crazy. Excuse me, but I almost had it, my Head ripped and it hurts like hell. It's just psychological. Your neck does not hurt. Oh yeah? You would know better about it? Yes, he would, Wiley. It was his old neck, which was broken. This is your new neck. Take it? Give a break, I was killed. twice in two hours. We've all been dead before. Do you know what bothers me? I've never seen a white light. I've never seen any angel, nothing. Give me some time. "REJECTED ENTRY" I already have you logged in. What? When? Twenty minutes ago. According to this, you just entered, in a restricted area. The son of a bitch took my thumb. Turn off Talia, put a security alert and close Drucker's office. No. Come on. Shit. Can I help you? Yes. You can stick your thumb there. "OXYGEN" Thank God. More fundamentalists? No, Adam Gibson. We think he's in the building. Why was not he taken care of? You had all night. There are four of you and one of him. Well, two of it if you see, what I mean. He has a wife and daughter, right? Yes sir. Get them. We may need, of leverage. Yes sir. It costs me 1.2 million each time, that I clone people. Try to be worth the money. They will kill you for seeing this. They are doing their best already. Where is dr. Weir? Your lab is over there. Dr. Weir. Oh I know of the intruder. The office called. Everything is under control. It's not under control. You cloned me. Yes. Well, you cloned the wrong man. How did you do it? You had to have mine, DNA... what is your name? Your timing. Yes we did. Give me this. I want my life back. Here is your timing. How did you get this? I did not go... On here. The vision test. That alone did not test his vision. It took your sync... an exact image of your mind. And took a sample, of its D.N.A. With these two things, we can clone one person in two hours. We had you in the file, so that we could act quickly, when we were told, that you were killed. Said I was killed? Please do not drink and drive. Gibson family time... Clara's recital at school. This is Michael Drucker. A sync contains everything, in the memory of a person, This is what Drucker saw and heard just before he died. You do not become one of the richest men, of the world without making enemies, then... We support your mind religiously. Hey, you own the roadrunners, right? Among other things. Yes. You are fan? No, I'm a big fan of both teams. Well, I'll have to buy it, some tickets. You promise, right? Sure, I'll do it now. Sally, it's me. I remembered to buy tickets for Adam Gibson. He's my pilot today. Right. Perfect! On the sixth day God created man. No, I'm about to go up, on my snowboard. Hey! He has a gun! Hey. You're a fundamentalist. He just shot both of them. You call Marshall now, hunm. Do you hear me, sally? Marshall? No, you do not have to... sally! Hen... A fundamentalist anti-cloning, killed everyone on board. It should have been me. Well, we thought it was you. Drucker mentioned, his name. Then we use your D.N.A. and its synchronization, to clone you. To resurrect Drucker, we had cover up the accident. Keep talking. We cloned everyone. The moment we discover that you changed places, it was too late. "ASSE?O DENIED" They're trying to kill me. Because there are two Adam Gibson. And this is proof that humans are being cloned. What makes you so dangerous, for Michael Drucker. Access denied. Tell me why I am a threat, for Michael Drucker. Drucker was killed three years ago. We then cloned him and we cloned him yesterday. Like this? If that were to happen, Drucker would be destroyed in every way. A clone has no rights. A clone can not own anything. Drucker would lose all that. Because Drucker would be legally dead. Full Level Search seven to level five. See all the cameras. Hunm... hunm you can not, nor find a guy? It's there. I do not need, see where he is. We need to find out, Where is him now. Come on. Set the alarm. What is up? What area is so sensitive, we do not allow cameras? Drucker will do anything to destroy the evidence. And you are the evidence. That's proof too. Move yourself! Clear the way! Come on. No, no. She is rehearsing all week. I have to go to the bathroom. Be well, Clara. Someone else needs go to the bathroom? Oh fuck! Damn! Hey fuck! Why do you think, What am I telling you? I can not do anything to stop, what they are trying to do. There he is! Zone six, engineering corridor. Move yourself! Clear the way! And what they may be trying to do, with your family. What about my family? Drucker has to kill one of you. If he can not kill you, it goes to the other. And your family, can be killed in the process. Skirt! Destination "leave" not understood. Morgan Randall Elementary School. I'm sorry, sir. Dad! She should be there, up now, right? This is the... this is weird. I'll just make sure that all is well. All right. Excuse me. Clear. Clear. Oh my God. mom? Mom, I'm scared. I am here. I have you. Could you help us, please? What are you doing? Look this? It is the only thing that prevents, Let the dogs tear it. So be quiet and come with us. Hide and seek, As long as you want, Because that's how the teddies have their picnic. Not! Come on! Dad! Move it. Adam! Natalie! Do not. You reached 911, is police emergency. Your call is important to us. Yes I know. Your answers "yes" or "no" will help us, to direct the police to help him. Let's go! Yes. Are you reporting a crime? Yes. Thanks for reporting, a crime. Let's go. The crime is in progress now? Yes. Thank you. Is there any current danger of damage to you or to other people? Yes! No need be so angry! Forget talking to the police. I already tried that. Who are you? Who are you? I know, this sounds insane, but I'm Adam Gibson. What? We do not have time for you to be shocked. now because they have Natalie and Clara. And I need your help, to recover my family. They are my family. This was for sleeping, with my wife in the damn minivan. Your "yes" or "no"... and your report has expired or canceled at your request. It's him. Mr. Gibson, I believe you have something of mine Oh no. I have everything yours. I have the synchronization, which proves that you are a clone. And I have all your... his family in the palm of my hand. Should we negotiate? You read my mind. Just the highlights. All right. I'll bring the disk to the office double letter X at 10:00 tonight. Be there, with my family. Why did you have, Who hit me so hard? Well, I had to stop you. to talk to the police. Yes, this is good. That should solve. What are you doing? Testing this. Because I do not think that you have enough aluminum there. Are you kidding me? This is exactly the same amount, that they used in the war of the rainforest. You should not be talking. The mess you left trying to repair his garage. Did you see me working? in the garage? I saw you? I almost shot you. We will try. Wow!! Nice. Nice. You better be miles away. away when that happens. I'm more concerned with putting ourselves, in the building to find Natalie and Clara. I'm going to to risk coming out. Griffin Here. What are you doing? Yours, yours. Griffin, what's the problem? My wife, Katherine, is dead. Oh Jesus Christ Griffin, I do not know... Excuse me. Do not start with "sorry". Do not start! Do not start! I'm terribly sorry. Do not start with "sorry"! I know about the birth defects that you are incorporating into clone D.N.A. Has my wife Johnny Phoenix and the others. But Michael, because my wife. Because? You're right, Griffin. It is a security protocol, which I implemented. I did not tell you, because you would not understand. What should I understand? The only thing I understand is that you gave my wife cystic fibrosis. Griffin, calm down. Somebody made a mistake. This was never done, to hurt Katherine. Oh, that did not hurt her. He just killed her. Suppose we clone a senator who agreed to support us, but he take your word back. What is the point? Or Johnny Phoenix wants to double his salary. By giving them a shorter life, we our leverage. What is the point? The point is... if they betray us, They are dead. If they remain on the team, we cloned them again and no damage will be caused. And that is exactly what Let's do it with Katherine. She is being cloned while we talk. No, she is not. No, she is. Do not. Griffin, it was a mistake. If you are worried, with D.N.A., go through it herself, make sure it is clean. And of course there will be no no cost for cloning. Oh, no cost. Thank you very much. Thank you What you do not understand, is that she does not want to be cloned. So you do it anyway. Do this anyway? I understand. Let me explain something to you. It's very simple. I loved my wife very much. So much that I promised that never again, I would bring it back and I will not. If I can not bring her back, I'll never bring anyone back. That's how much I loved her. So it's over, It's over and I quit. Well, I can not. let you give up Yes well. I looked, to the other side many times and I justified a lot, then... I finished! Ended. You know what I'm going to To Do For You, Griffin? What are you going to do for me? I'll give you the biggest gift, that you could imagine. A gift? I'm going to save your life. I'm going to save Katherine. I'm going to save our friendship. And I'm going to save your marriage. Michael, what are you talking about? I'm going to kill you now. And then I'll clone you, using his latest recording. So I'm going to clone Katherine. using his latest recording. You understand? No. You see what I am doing for you? You and Katherine will be there. together again... and none of you will remember that you promised not to clone her. Or that she even died. And obviously you do not You will remember this conversation. You are welcome. All right. Now show me, my family. Bastards, I knew. Your timing is not here and neither is it. He was being taken by the remote control or something. You two come back here. Let's go. This is a private block. You can not land this here. Technologies only of substitution. I'm here to pick up, Mr. Drucker. On here. It's my letter contract. It's ok. Everything is normal, Mr. Drucker, but we will be alert. What time do you plan to take off? Take off No I did not... your pilot is, on the way to reception. Now you listen to me. Seal the building, full security alert. You find this pilot. He is armed and very dangerous. Take Wiley and some men, to my office now. Freeze the elevators and close, the parking garages. There on the monitor 12. Zone six, engineering corridor. Sector three. He's going straight to you. Turn around, turn around. Do not even try that. Take some people, on that stairway to the west. Team three and four shut down about it. Come on. He must have thrown in a box of strength. He is destroying the whole system. We caught him in jail. West staircase, between 13 and 14. Come on! Cover the doors, the stairs! Fire in front of him. Okay, you did very well. You cheated us at the airport. You managed to transform, this place in a mess. Want to get us there and kill you? Good. You're the biggest dad. But Mr Drucker would like to to talk to you. And of course, we have your family. All right. Go get him, go get him, go. Well well. Adam Gibson. I wish I could say, "the first and only". It seems that we both came back, at our word, was not it? You may think we have more, in common than you thought. Where is my family? Right to business. An admirable feature. There they are. All safe and sound. For the moment. And its syncording, it is not in it. It is not in your whisper. I knew you'd fool me, so I gave it to my clone. If something happens with me, or my family, Next time you see your sync will be in your judgment, for homicide. Dr. Weir did not tell you, did he? Tell me what? Adam, Adam and Adam. He is not the clone. You are. I want you to ask, to himself something. Do you remember anything afterward to be scanned by my bodyguard? I need to check your vision. Look ahead. Do you really remember to change places with your friend? Hey, buddy, wake up. We are here, forest mall. The seller of the RePet store found Strange, you come twice... asked the same questions, twice. Still can not decide, right? You lost a dog, right? Let me see your chin. Did you cut yourself by shaving? Your beard cut? Easily reproduced. Such was the scar of his old war wound. I know who I am. I know, you do. Talia, how many times Have you been cloned? I lost count. There is a way to say. Show him. It's the only way to keep up with the generation, which a clone is. Watch? Four points mean, that she was cloned four times. Let's go. Let's take a look at yours. Come and take a look in the mirror. Let's find out if you are, Who do you think you are. Just under your left eye. Kind of way out of grace of being alive, is not it? So you see, your family is not, really his family, they are his. Is that you... my friend, is exactly, in the same boat, as all of us. If Adam Gibson can do this according to the authorities, we will all be destroyed. If you really love your wife and daughter, You're going to tell me where Adam Gibson is. We'll get my recording. Back, let's get rid of him. Tell me where Adam Gibson is. We will recover my synchrony, we will get rid of it. We'll get my sync. Back, let's get rid of him. And they will never have, than to know that you are the clone. It is this or lose them, forever. You know, Adam. I am not doing this offer because I have to do. I can achieve everything, I need your memories. The fact is that we would like, that you understood, who would also be serving, to a greater purpose. In two years, three moles, I will control, enough votes, to change the laws. And then we will not have to lose our best people. We will not have, We miss our Mozarts. We will not have to lose our Martin Luther Kings. We will be able of conquering, death. We can finally conquer, death. And who decides who lives and who dies. You? Do you have a better idea? Yes, is it God? Oh, you're one of those. I suppose you think that science, is inherently evil? Not... I do not think science, is inherently bad. But I think, that you are. If you believe that God created the man, in his own image, then you also believe that God gave, to man the power to understand evolution. To explore science, to manipulate the genetic code, to do exactly, what am I doing. I'm just assuming, where God stopped. If you really believe that, then you should clone yourself, while still alive. And why this? So I can understand your unique perspective? No. Then you can, fuck off Now you're going to tell us where you are. put the recording of Mr. Drucker! You will not find it, In my head. I told him to hide, so I would not know where it was. Let's see about this, shall we not? Yes, we will go. Come on. Between here. Let's go! Come on! Let's go! All right, do it your way. Take a piece of me. One piece, which you can not see, Take a piece of me. What I will not give up. Go slow with me. It did not hurt so much, did it? Idiot. Let's go back a few minutes. Here it is, Drucker's recording. There's the other one. Keep this and wait here. If I did not return in an hour, you know what to do. Do not worry. Everything happens with you or my family I'm going to destroy Son of a bitch. Do you have the location? The airport. I was just there. He'll be dead in 20 minutes. Come on. Betrayed by your own mind. Wait wait! What? They staged this scene, for our benefit. The other was sitting behind him, so that we could not see it. Look. The bastard pretended, your own recording. The other was hidden, no whispercraft... and he avoided looking at it, so that he was not in his memory. You mean that the other is in this building too? Yes, that's correct. Now, let Vincent know. Put another alert. This is the deviation. It crushes all the cameras. He is captured. Meanwhile, the other is free to only stroll here and take your wife and daughter. Oxygen. Oh... Oh... Hey, come on! Idiot! Oh... Ah... Natalie! Clear! Dad! Oh my gosh! What is going on? It's me. Dad? Oh God! Do not worry, sir. Get up. Oh shit. Everything is fine now. I'm scared, Dad. I'm scared. Is not that because of the cigar? No, I'll explain later. Dad, I'm scared. Do not worry. He will not go, nowhere, sir. We'll get him. Come on. Wait! Talia, you will. You two stay here. Have them blocked, all exits. Yes, Henderson, come in. Select entire areas, of tank levels six and seven. I'm trying, sir. Give me a minute. And give us some, power up here. Do not move! My daughter is well inside that door. Now, I do not want to expose her, to any graphic violence. She gets enough of the media. Put your guns down. Legal and easy. Good. Now, when you Come in, you say... have a good flight. Have a great flight, little girl. Dad's friends. All right, let's go. Have a little flight, at midnight with Papa and Mama. Here we are. All right? Excuse. There you go, sir. Wiley, Go. All right. Wiley, wait a second. Not again! Oh... It's ok! And do not bring it back. Stupid bastard has opened a hole, in my stomach. Oh God! I'll be dead, in a maximum of 20 minutes. But what better place, right? Henderson? Where is my power? Relays are coming online now, sir. Get all blocked outputs. All exits! Shit! Go start to warm up, a space. I want a new recording. I want to, May my mind be by the minute. All right, here it is. This is a new one. This will be a synchronization. Is that Talia? Shit! Go help her. We'll find him. DNA absorption 60%, incomplete. Cellular growth incomplete 85% Skeletal growth check. incomplete 72%. Skin formation What did you get? Tanks three and four, nothing. All right, go. Take the way back. Not! "Impeccable" Michaele Drucker. Do not. No, no. Not... Oh God! Oh no. Take it to your mother. Stay there until I get you. I got her. It's ok. Come with us, Dad. I have to help a friend, It's ok? Goodbye. I love you. Wiley, you shot me! Oh okay. Was you. I have to dress. You will not even wait until... I die Or would you? Come on, take it off. Oh... Ah... Blood on the jacket. Jesus Christ. What? I... Oh... What? Oh... What? Look. Adam, we can Make a deal. You have absolutely no no reason to kill me. I did nothing to you. It was all him. Listen me. I can rebuild everything this in a very short time. I can still save you, Adam. Save me? We put defects congeners in the D.N.A. clone, to give clones short lifetimes. Do you want to know what you're going to die for? How long do you have to live? We can go upstairs, now and look up. We all have to die one day. We do not have to die. I'm offering you, the chance to live forever. Never getting old. Perfect in every way. Perfect. I like you? Look! Here is your perfection! Do not. No, no, no. Oh God, oh God! No need for panic. I can fix this. No, you will not fix anything. Ended. It's over. It's over! When I said, that you should get screwed, I did not want you understood everything literally. Oh! Go after him. Just get him. Check the roof. You, you, up there! Bastard! Let's go! He's coming up! He's climbing the stairs! Now. Get him! Let's go! I'll be right back! Can you fly this? Better than you. Good. Because your Shooting sucks. Let's get out of here. Oh shit! Let's go! Let's go! Try to get over me! Let's go! Hurry up! Shit! Let's go! Chair... Oh shit! "ADVENTURE PATAGONIA" You know, I continue asking me. Am I really human? Do I have a soul? Well, your A.D.N., scan returned normal. It was not Sim? With zero defects. Just like a RePet commercial. Well, if you're not human, do not you think that they would have mentioned it? All right, enough philosophy. I'd better go. I have three weeks, in the sea to discover it. You have to hurry. if you want to see Clara. Ah. Thank you for saying goodbye, from your family. Now wait. This is your family too. You were willing, to die to save them. Think about it while you're in the sea, wondering if you are, really human or not. Because if this is not being human, I do not know what it is. Thank you. Hello, everyone. Look, what I brought. A kitten! Oh... Sadie. Oh. I thought, um, Hank's cat was... she is. But you hate RePets. The mom. Well, I've changed my mind. You old softie. Can we have it? Please? Please? Clear.
