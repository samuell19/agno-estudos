The Lord did not come to be served, but to serve. Soon, I will have hooves. Water, quickly! If you have to fight, we must fight. With spades, guns, cannons, hammers. Fight to defend oneself. It's not a crime. What did you release? Seven poor devils. A madman, four forgers, a chicken thief ... - To hell with the prisoners! - We took the powder. Three hundred barrels for our rifles. Clemency! You lose your head? You, take care of your sisters. Go! We will run out of water. Place for my little Prosper! Pass the water and pass the fortune! Margot. It's good, Françoise. Go see your daughter. Paris will resist to the King's troops. Paris has brought down the Bastille! I was leaning over it. I had my penknife in my hand. The governor did not move too much. I felt a nudge and here is the knife who crashes into the governor's neck between two bones. - To others! - Song! You sliced ​​his head to the governor of the Bastille. Cook's word, I tell you, I reacted with a kick. Since the time that these infamous towers we freeze blood and bones! I do not deny it, you have been magnificent! Finally ! beautiful like men without god. So we decided that the Desnot, he would keep his head until morning. You know what he answers, the guy? Being married, if I bring the head any sticky governor at home, that might make a revolution with my wife. - What did you do? - Of the head ? Ben like you, you would have done. Do you want to see, Clemence? He had a hard head, the governor ! It's not him ! We just won the fort of the Bastille. Ah, the beautiful day! The beautiful day! Saint Anthony took These infamous towers. And I, Reine Audu, I can say, I fought. In time, everything will be done. Salt, bread we'll have. After the thorn, the flower will come Brandy at full pot. Hallelujah! Hallelujah. Breath. Breath. Breath. It's okay. Come to see ! Solange! This is the first time I see the sun in this angle of view. Francoise! Françoise, come quickly! Light! Come on, come here, you! See if it's not beautiful! Touch the sun and make a wish. Stop! Stop! Women of the Halles! Women from the suburbs, all of us! Listen! We want the King to leave Versailles. And his infamous court. We want wheat, bread and rights. We want the King to leave Versailles. In Paris in our walls. Freedom will give us bread and wings. We want the King to leave Versailles and his infamous court. We want the King to leave Versailles and his infamous court. Yesterday trampling the cockade, tomorrow the grape shot. We are going to Versailles look for our King. We are going to Versailles look for our King. We want wheat, bread. Bread and rights. All in chorus! May the King leave Versailles In Paris in our walls. May the King leave Versailles In Paris in our walls. Freedom will give us bread and wings. Freedom will give us bread and wings. We have things to tell you. Where are the rascals who granted the veto to the King? We are in the Assembly here. Make the flours escape to the hoarders and give us back. Make the cockade do not be insulted. Bread is rare. You have to get up in the night to hope to have a loaf. Bread ... and good laws, it's the same. It's hope. New rights. Legality. - Listen to us. That's what we want. I tell you one voice at a time. Who of you is speaking, please ? Citizen Maillard. Patriot and winner of the Bastille. Gentlemen. Gentlemen. Gentlemen, Paris suffers. Paris is hungry. How many bags are back in town during the last ten days? Fifty three. - Balivernes! Yes, gentlemen. 53 bags and 500 skewers of wheat. - Pure lie! For hundreds of thousands hungry Parisians. We are screwing our noses to the ground. We do not make bread with dust. Gentlemen. Do not you see that it is a maneuver? - We are tired. - We are hungry. We can do more. These women are manipulated by the Duke of Orleans. I am not Austrian. I am from the Halle. I am Reine Audu. And I have a stone in my stomach! And you feathered him, What's in your belly? Roast, guinea fowl? This washerwoman ... buried his baby six days ago. Tell them. They must know! President, are we obliged to listen to these people of little? Cum! - Rogue! - It's you, the little people! I remember you respect for this place. We have a constitution to write for France. What will save us is that the King come and stay in Paris. That he chases the hoarders and hungry people. The place of a king is not to be far from his people. Louis XVI in Paris! The King in Paris! The taste of freedom will pass to them. The King in Paris? Never ! The King's place is at Versailles. From your life, you will not see never the King in Paris. Gentlemen. Gentlemen. President. Let's go to the King, in delegation, bring to the castle the position so unfortunate from Paris. And we will get his signature for the decrees of September. The country is waiting for them and the country hopes for them. The King will be touched by these women. Let's get these signatures. Margot ! They come back from the castle. You scared me. I waited three hours in the living room of the bull's eye. Then a valet came. He accompanied me to the council room. The king... The king... Mr. Mounier, you have my acceptance. Thank you, Majesty. If your Majesty could give me his agreement in writing? Declaration of human and citizen rights. First article. Men are born and remain free and equal in law. Social distinctions can not to be founded only on the common good. Article two. Go to hell ! The goal of any political association is the conservation of natural rights and imprescriptible of the man. These rights are freedom, the property, security, and resistance to oppression. The principle of all sovereignty resides essentially in the Nation. The King has signed! Long live the National Assembly! Take good care from my poor Versailles. Well, here's the King Sapergue! Leave Versailles. To come to Paris straight ahead to settle far from the rabble. The Queen has come too accompanied by their children. Accompanied by their little ones. Seems he was refusing to come, And danced on our cockades. Then we had to fetch him and shoot down fifteen or twenty guards. At the sight of our guns, the King became as sweet as a sheep. The King became sweet as a sheep. Now that he's in Paris, And that he will drink the water of the Seine, The king all the time will make love to our sovereign. To put him, as the priest says, a choirboy in the holy water font. A choirboy in the holy water font. Our deputies also leave Versailles. The Assembly settles in the former King's Ride. Close to the Tuileries. Gentlemen. The constitution committee proposes you a division of the kingdom into 80 departments. I have the honor to observe that the cause that I defend ... touch so closely to the interests of the people that I have the right to all your attention. The census election mode that you defend is a crime. As it stands, political equality is destroyed. Take your eyes off this class. That we designate with contempt by the name of "people". - It's the people! - That's how it's called. - What is his name ? - I do not know. I only know Mirabeau. He is a lawyer. He defends equality. We do not know if it's Robespierre or Rabaispierre. You who degrade the greatest part of the human race by the words "canaille" or "populace". This multitude of men whom I defend the cause have rights who have the same origin than yours. Who gave you the power to take it away? Monsieur de Robespierre, you are a preacher of anarchy. Do you want an assembly of beggars? Orphans? Silence in the stands! They are idiots here. This is where we make the laws? Let Robert-Pierre talk, damn it! Silence in the tribune! There are no two ways to be free. It must be completely or become a slave again. You can give laws to citizens but you can not annihilate them. - Wise decision ! Return to Arras, M. de Robespierre. There are no two ways to be free. - There is only one. - Ours. My dear faithful, if I have gathered you, it is to speak to you benefits of the Revolution. In the old days we were captives. Shy. Weak as slaves. Today, incense and fragrance of our freedom ... are felt in the entire Europe. Yes. The name "French" ... will be desired ... of the entire universe. Yes, I tell you, my friends. In the name of the Father, of the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Amen. Forgive yourself. Forget offenses, remorse, regrets. And let's stop this time of quarreling and jealousies at the foot of this tree of freedom. There would be one more. What's your name ? Every man has a name. Even you. I am a donkey. Basil, you will remember that day. What are we accusing this child of God? He stole my watch. If this Basil works for you. What you will just consider accepting. Forgive me. Come on, Julien, forgive him. Clemency. It's freezing cold ! - Are you ok Tonin? - It's okay. And you Janis? Here is our Molière! So Janis, What have you done today. I did not leave and I washed my feet. To celebrate the new machine. Guillotin political doctor. Imagine a beautiful morning that hanging is inhuman and not very patriotic. Guillotin says: the mechanics fall ... like lightning. The head flies, blood flows, springs. The man ... is ... no more. Sacredie, you will never guess what they have just voted in the Assembly. The Constitution. When do we see it, our constitution. They work there, Gabrielle. They work there again and again. I know: the goods of the Church who come back to the Nation. Already done. - Citizen actors. - Already done. - Jewish citizens. - Already done. - Say! So ? - I know I know. Active women. Women who would be citizens. What, hollow head? She did not fall alone, the Bastille. - I was there. - We were all at the Bastille. Sorry, but I am active. It's heard throughout the yard. She's never tired, the Landelle! His Landelle, it is stretched like green wood. They voted! It's today, Saturday, February 12, 1791 that everyone is allowed in France to grow tobacco. Like salt, we can say "long live the free tobacco"! Sacredie, no? - Free tobacco! - Free tobacco, then. Why would Janis vote and not us? Té, because the actors have civil rights, now. Janis will never vote. He is too poor. What do you know, old kernel? And I am too much woman to vote! Too poor! Janis will be active ... those who pay taxes. The poll is the vote of the richest. They are scoundrels. Must change them! We have our nose in the dust. You have become not-big-things. But I believe it! What did you do with my kingdom? Majesty? It's you ? The Grand Louis? Still in your bed! Lazy ! You lost your rank, your place. Your people. What did you do with my kingdom? Answer your Sun King. I also hear that you have abandoned Versailles! Abandon Versailles? I was kicked out. - Wretched ! - Slack King! Do not you have other distractions to your troubles your pillow and your dreams? Let me explain, Henry of Navarre. They keep me at the Tuileries. The times are difficult. I do politics. You are especially ashamed! My ancestors. A veto? What is it what is this custom? A veto!? That's all I have left. - Enough ! Enough! - You afflict us! - You ruin us. - No ! So you did not learn anything? History does not make us. We make history! Do not brag about being a Bourbon! You're just a jester! - A degenerate! You ruin us. Louis the Dull! Louis the Zero. Ghost ! Farewell. Stay! Do not leave me! Only a burst of pride will save you. How? The war. The King fled! The King fled! What a coward! Leave us like this. It is shameful ! Rather die than suffer invasion by foreign troops! Long live the patriots! Loyalty to the Assembly. Loyalty to the deputies! Oh it'll be ok, I'll be fine despite the mutineers, everything will succeed. I swear fidelity to the National Assembly. Oh it'll be ok, I'll be fine despite the mutineers, everything will succeed. Only our deputies to defend ourselves. Must make alliance. - Like water and earth. Fidelity to the Nation! - Long live freedom ! - Long live the law! Loyalty to the National Assembly! Loyalty to the National Assembly! - Fidelity to the Nation! - Fidelity to our deputies! Long live equality! And when we hang them all, we will steal the straw in their ass. Ah it'll hold, it'll hold, it'll hold, and in two thousand years, we will remember. Look ! They arrested the King! The King is caught? They arrested the King! In Varennes. With the Queen. Sanson, our King does not flee! It's a big peccata! The king fled! - Hey, rascal! - Hey, the Revolution! I want to see my King again. You owe me another 50 days of chore. Stop. Wood. Eh, big Louis without brains, I have two poults for you. Your mouth, ignorant! We respect the sovereign. This fat fugitive pig. Do you want war? Do you want the torn Nation? - He does not want war. Without Louis, the whole building would collapse. Your calm, Barnave, astonishes me. Where are you going, citizen? June 25, all Paris is on the place Louis-XV ... to see the return of the traitor. French, take back your rights! Feel your strength! Feel your dignity! French, today it's up to you to dictate the laws. Even Marat came out of his hole. Here he is brought back to our walls, this crowned brigand. Perjury, traitor and conspirator! Do not let yourself be touched by her tears, nor to his promises. If he deserted his job once, he will desert him ten thousand! Now, silence for the traitor! Him ? Citizen? Eat, it's nice to see. Did not you see anything in Varennes? Did not you see anything in Varennes? Leave him. Eat. Did not you see anything? Do you know what's going on here? Do you know why the King left and why did we bring him back? You have a family ? Stop ! Stopped ! Do you have a bell tower? Here is the trouble, the hero! Grandma! What country are you from ? Leave him alone with your damn questions! That's not what he needs. I have no father, no mother. I'm going, I'm coming, I swallow the dust. I have no steeple. I have no-one in the eyes. So, he stays? He stays. Is the King a simple citizen? Punishable like any other? - He betrayed. - He deserted. A king is both a man, a citizen, an official. In the facts, the King betrayed. - He was kidnapped. - Yes, removed. Maybe not by ... a body constraint. We would have forced by a constraint of the mind. The King went to foreign lands to change our fertile plants in an ocean of blood. And you defend him? Silence, the tribune. Silence! President. A revolution must exist only through order. Disorder would annihilate it. The next speaker is Mr Prugnon. The day France will have perpetual representatives and no king ... will be the last day of freedom. All power almost always ends to corrupt men. The use of authority engenders the ambition of authority. The history of all revolutions, represents beings of power who end up to exercise the most terrible of all despotisms. He who wears the costume of freedom. When there is in a state a body that says "I want", you need another body who can say "I do not want to". If there is a meeting of powers in one body there is despotism. That's why we need and a King and an elected assembly. For the state to sit on both legs, standing, in balance. The Nation will grow. Well spoken, Joseph! Buy my ribbons! She is very good, the height. Here. Come and read. You take my hand. And your laundry? You laugh ? A long time ago that I do not laugh anymore with men. What are you saying ? I say : friend, I know some who took the Bastille, and I know one who will take Basil. There will be sequels. I do not like the chicken thief. Get out! It was before. They have no word. Emerges. Before, we heard forgiveness. Are you going with the night? No, I want my darling. I want my darling. I saw the sun. He touched my hand. I saw the King. He touched my head. One day, I saw the Queen with goblins. And she threw a handkerchief to the children laughing. Strange. Your lip. Basil! Do you think we'll succeed? Mr Barnave, it's your turn to speak. Gentlemen. Any government, to make the people happy, must make it free. Any government, to be good, must enclose in him ... the principles of its stability. Any change is fatal today. Any extension of the Revolution is disastrous today. Will we finish the revolution ? If the Revolution goes one step further, she can not do it without danger, because to prolong freedom, the first act that could follow ... would be the annihilation of royalty. Because to prolong the equality, the first act that could follow would be the attack on property. You are attached to the property like a slave to his master! Marat, calm down. Gentlemen, if the Revolution is made for the Nation, it must not touch the property. She must stop ... at the moment the Nation is free and where all the French are equal. Bullshit! The French are not equal! Silence! Silence in the stands or I interrupt the session. If the Revolution continues in the troubles, therefore, she is no longer than the advantage of a few men. Since then, she is dishonored and therefore we are ourselves. Today... Today everyone must feel that the common interest is that the Revolution stops! Listen to those who tell us from all sides "You have been brave, you are powerful, " "Be wise today and moderate. " "This is where will the end of your glory. " Yes, gentlemen. It is time to end the Revolution. It's time to finish with Monsieur Barnave! And this time has come, this time is today, July 15, 1791. Consequently... I adopt Mr. Salle's proposal, supporter of the inviolability of the King. Perjury! Gravedigger of the people! Gravedigger of the Nation! - Perjury! - Perjury! What does it mean, "Inviolability"? It means that they will do nothing against the King. These deputies are ... scoundrels. We swore allegiance to them and they let us go. They want us to stay children. Good children unable to understand. Just good to be without eyes, without memory. - How was it ? - Sad. But we will have them. We are back worse than in 89! A pact between Barnave and the Austrian! I have tears of blood. So what do we do ? We take another king? - I do not want another cape. For him to betray us too and league with Austria, Spain, Italy ... Say what you think, Citizen. I'm not a fly of Lafayette, I do not know anything about the laws. My job, it is to make verses. A poet ! Monsieur makes rhymes. Uncle, he makes glasses. Bottles for the wine. For drunkenness. Declare on the field that France is no longer a monarchy. To become what? A republic, as in Rome. It's going fast. That's what the Cordeliers spread throughout Paris. It's us, the Cordeliers. Cum! It's not your neighborhood here. - We petition. - We have tabled 17 petitions since June. Signed by 30,000 citizens. - And citizens. Yesterday again, we have been disowned to the Assembly. Republic is an abstract word for the people. I know some sans-culottes who will defend monarchy to the last drop of their blood. Defend the monarchy? Why defend the monarchy? It is the Revolution that must be defended. Sunday we call all sections of Paris to petition. In the Champ-de-Mars. Come without weapons. In family. It will be a beautiful day for freedom. In the Champ-de-Mars. If it's for freedom, you will see me there. The uncle. Antoine-François Momoro. Printer, engraver, bookseller. Varlet, Jean-François. Candole, Françoise. Margot Laforce. We too will see you there. - Which section are you in? - The Arsenal. St. Anthony. - Arsenal petitioned? - Had to cross the river! We are at the Cordeliers. There is no need for a map. Women are admitted. Especially pretty women like you. The Cordeliers. It's not a wedding club. Jealous people are also very good Republicans. That's what we are going to see. We were walking. Cockades were on all the breasts. We talked. We were good. When there was the red flag, the red flag of martial law. Spread! Martial law! Shoot me lead in the ass of this bitch! The weapon in your hand! The uncle ? The uncle ? Lord, give them eternal rest. And that on them endless shines your light. By the mercy of God. What rest in peace the souls of the deceased faithful. Amen. Amen. I salute you marie, full of grace. The Lord is with you. You are blessed among all women. And Jesus, the fruit of your womb, is blessed. Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us, poor sinners. Now and at the hour of our death. Amen. Angel of God, you my guardian, at all times watch over me, Night, day and morning. All my life, be my support. Keep me from harm and guide me to eternal life. Amen. Amen. We put them together in the box. Our father who is in heaven, Hallowed be thy name, Thy kingdom come, Thy will be made on earth as in heaven, give us today our bread today, forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive too to those who have offended us. Marat fled. They stop the Republican at arm's length. I saw Robespierre in a house in St-Honoré. Louis-Joseph Henri, said Uncle. Francoise Candole. Janis son of Nicolas Barrucan, actor. Damn you ! You are under arrest. Louis-Joseph Henri, said Uncle. It's me. Respect the dead. Janis son of Nicolas Barrucan, actor. Francoise Candole. It's me. Citizen. Did you go to the Champ-de-Mars Sunday, July 17, 1791? Yes. Like others. Appointed. Appointed. Tonin. Paco. Why did you go there? To sign the petition. Like any good citizen. We came without weapons. Without canes or sticks. She was talking about what, this petition? The wish of the citizens. Live freely. And not Louis XVI. So you signed for the decay of the King? I signed for justice. For the Revolution. Freedom ... or death. Freedom or death. Did you throw or see throwing stones? No. Are you a member of a club? No. Which newspapers do you read? I'm not those who can read. You counted how many, of our dead? Sorry, I ask the questions. 400. You threw 400 patriots at the Seine. What nay! From man's memory, have we ever seen police throw men at the Seine? - Marat says it. - Marat is a rat. I do not listen to rats. So why Bailly ordered to raise the nets of St-Cloud? So that the sea swallows all these deaths. That's what you hide. Enough ! Put that one back in your cell. I'm not done. Me though. The madmen tire me. The National Guard fired on the orders of Lafayette, no? The National Guard, are you citizens like you and me? Since July 14, the citizens defend Paris. So, tell me, citizen ... how citizens were able to shoot other citizens? For me, the word citizen has a value. There is no more loose, There is no more despicable treason. Lafayette you killed my sister Margot. Lafayette I will spit on your grave. The constitution guarantees as natural and civil right ... freedom to every man to go, to stay, to leave ... without power to be arrested or detained ... that according to the forms determined by the constitution. The freedom of every man to speak ... to write, print and publish his thoughts. The freedom of citizens to assemble peacefully and without arms. Kingship and the King. Article one. Royalty is indivisible and delegated hereditarily to the ruling race from male to male to perpetual exclusion women and their descendants. Article two. The person of the King is inviolable and sacred. His only title is King of the French. Mr Thouret brings us reading. Article three. The legislative power is delegated to a National Assembly composed of representatives freely elected by the people. Well, Ministers, we will read. Tuesday, September 13, 1791. Gentlemen, the King accepts. He will execute the constitution. The King asks a general pardon for all. This is the best day that France has known since 1,400 years it exists. Never the court, neither his servants, will not betray you in the rough and vulgar sense. They will deceive you. They will put you to sleep. They will exhaust you. They will betray you with art, with moderation, with citizenship, with patriotism. They will betray you slowly, constitutionally as they did so far. The seat of evil is not in Europe, in Warsaw or on the other side of the Rhine, the danger is two steps from here, he's at the Tuileries, he is at the Manège. The danger is also ... in the midst of us. Courage! Come on, scream, my daughter! Free yourself ! Coward! Come on, scream! You're right. It will be hot in my workshop. Free yourself. You are the most beautiful. Another effort, Françoise. Madame Sainte-Marguerite, worthy virgin of God, have mercy on us. Stay seated. Wood. This one, she did not pray. There you go ! God, Solange, it is you who is going to fetch the water! Come on, come with me, you. Basil, life gives to all men. Now take him to church. The country is at war. The friendly armies of the King threaten to destroy Paris if one infringes to Louis XVI or his family. The sections are in the highest fever. There are some who say that the healthiest duty, the most cherished faith, it is to forget the law to save the Fatherland. National Assembly debate and the enemy approaches. Citizens of the Paris sections, hit the colossus scary of despotism. Let him fall! It breaks apart! And that the sound of his fall makes him pale the tyrants to the ends of the world. Be together. Let's say a common agreement, Louis XVI is no longer King of the French. France does not know to live without a king So can there be other kings than this Louis, this traitor? Lafayette is preparing a coup d'etat. Yes, we are asking for a fee. The right to suspend the law, but it is to save the Fatherland. Why would members listen to you? Members are free to listen to us or not. - And after ? - You know the answer, citizen. It is written in the declaration rights where your children learn to read. Insurrection is a right which belongs to all. Let's not be surprised ... if our enemies invoke with so much ardor the constitution. You forget a little fast ... that all the despots of Europe have coalition to make war on France ... and save the cape. Marie, do not complain, complaint. - Big mouth ! - We can do it ! No, we can not. The constitution is sacred. You said that. Yes that's it. What are you afraid of? Speak! Here we are frank. No censorship. We all know what will be. Chaos and anarchy. I do not sign for chaos. Where will you stop, the Cordeliers? "Stop". You speak like the infamous Barnave. The idol is rotten. You have to reverse it, that's all. Quickly said. Better a caté king than a new tyrant. - He is right. - Damn, no. Never ! Listen to me carefully. The constitution is a contract like any other. The constitution puts us in danger. So we tear it up and we make another one, right? Where is the problem ? This is not anarchy, it's justice. Emile, sign with me. I am not afraid of chaos. From chaos are born great things. You add war to war. I do not sign for the civil war. When will there be more laws, what will be after? Life. There will be life after. You will have death. You see me ? Yes, we see you. - What do you want to tell us? - You see me ? Who's this funny? I'm signing. Look at all. Look at you. 1 hour of the life of a free man is better than 100 years of a slave's life. I sign. We slept too much For centuries. I sign. Freedom or death. Emile, sign! Emile, you're really a coward. Barrucan, Janis. Francoise Candole. Basil. Sit down there, please. Gentlemen, our one and only hope is only in the resistance to oppression. We ask that Louis XVI abdicates the crown. The lifting of 400,000 men to requisition wheat in the countryside. That it be made severe laws against any kind of grabbing. Wear, monopoly are moral assassinations. The people are tired. Citizen Varlet. You forget a little fast that the sovereignty belongs to a whole people, no to a section of the people. If justice and law are not done to the people ... by the legislature ... Thursday at eleven o'clock in the evening, the same day at midnight, the tocsin will ring. The General will be beaten and everything will rise at once. Silence! We will proceed to the vote. Sitting or up. Who supports the motion Mr. Lafayette's accusation? Who supports the opposite motion? - Shame on you ! - Perjury! You are all scoundrels! I think there is no place to charge against Mr. Lafayette. We are asking for the roll call. Paris... do not make the law to France, and will never do it. Louis is our wall. My friend, I am waiting with concern news of your health. We touch here at the biggest events. The Assembly yesterday absolved Lafayette. And everything seems to portend for this very night the biggest concussion in Paris. It's now. Wake up. Basil. It's there, yes. It's now. This is the signal. St. Anthony gets up. Saint-Marcel gets up. The 48 sections of Paris rise. Basil, the insurgency is not the day of national vengeance. Sans-culotte, citizen, it's simple. It will be freedom or death. You will know a day more terrible than all those you have known. Standing ! Training ! Freedom is not found under the hoof of a horse. - Go to your mother's place. - I do not have a mother. - At your father's then. - I do not have a father. Leave me alone, little one! Captain. The Val-de-Grâce opposes at the exit of the guns. Their section resists. I will be chopped into pieces but the guns will leave. - I do not want you to die. - And I do not want to lose my life winning it. I would rather get nailed on the walls of this palace ... than to take refuge at the Manège. Insurgents arrive by the thousands of suburbs. There is only security in the Assembly. But finally, sir, where are our troops? There are not enough men to guarantee your defense. Sire, this is no longer a prayer that we come to you. But a duty. Mr Roederer, do you answer for the life of the King? Yes. The Assembly will be your refuge. Is. Let's walk. Fidelity! Loyalty to our King! Loyalty to our Queen! Fire! We are all citizens. All brothers. Get away ! It burns ! Little Prosper. Louis XVI is in a cage Eat, eat cheese Like a wild bird It must be kept It must be kept Without letting him save As well as his female, Antoinette hypocritical and cruel Gros Louis without brains By her is caught By her is caught And the deceived people Get up and take up arms, to stop, to stop the alarms Louis in these din thought to be victorious Believed to be a winner But the henchmen without heart Basil. Basil. I ask that the National Assembly watches over ... on the safety of prisoners Swiss, thirty officers, putting them under the safeguard of the law and loyalty of France. President, this Swiss was my enemy. I want to lodge him and I want to feed him. Brotherhood! Citizen Clement, your name will appear in the minutes of the meeting. Let go. Make way. Square ! Citizen President, I ask for the floor. Legislator. Citizen. These are the new magistrates of the people who come to your bar. These are the new dangers of Motherland which caused our appointment. That traitors shudder in their turn. This day will see the triumph of civic virtues. First article. French people are invited to form a national convention. Article two. The chief executive is provisionally suspended from office. Until the national convention has declared on the measures it believes will have to adopt to ensure the sovereignty of the people and the reign of freedom and equality. Article three. The extraordinary commission will present in the day a way to organize a new ministry. Article four. The extraordinary commission will present also in the day a draft decree on the appointment of the governor of the royal prince. Article five. Courage, my daughter! Uncle is badly hurt. Basil told me so. - Did you see Basil? - Yes. What are our fights worth compared to our victories? What are our wounds worth? compared to our conquests? So far, we agitated the people. Because we had to give it the awakening against tyrants. Now, the laws must be so terrible against those who would undermine that the people have been by thundering tyranny. The laws must punish all the culprits. For the people no longer have anything to desire. We listen to you, O Danton. We must do justice to the people, so that he does not do it himself. That the law is terrible and everything will return to order. Citizens, prove that you want the reign of laws. And also prove that you want the salvation of the people. And especially, especially save the blood of the French. gentlemen, listen to this: "To see the tempering ..." "Most of the deputies to the National Convention, » "I despair of public safety. " "Fifty years of anarchy are waiting for you! " "O people bulletin board, if you knew how to act! " This call to crime is signed by Marat. Listen to Marat. So I have in this House a large number of personal enemies. That monster stop on the spot! I beg the Assembly not to to indulge in an excess of fury against me. I attest that it is written and done for ten days. Ten days. Even before the opening of the Convention. So I was indignant to see ... triumph this faction of the Gironde who is pursuing me today. A minority of these men. Yes ! I asked that the people was named a dictator. - Shut that rat down! - A military tribune. If the people could have felt the wisdom of this measure, everything today would be quiet. The traitors would have shuddered. 100,000 patriots would not have been slaughtered. 100,000 patriots would not be threatened with it. Streams of blood will make you one day feel your mistake. But... the incontestable proof I want to walk with you ... you real friends of the Homeland. This proof, here it is. The first issue of the newspaper of the French Republic. You would have seen him, And if, by a mad negligence of my printer I did not have this newspaper, what would you have done? Unbelievable. You would have therefore to the sword of tyrants? A wild beast. This fury is unworthy free men. And I do not fear anything under the sun! If the indictment would have been launched against me, I was burning my brain in front of you. Solange? So that's the result of three years of dungeons and torments wiped out to save the Fatherland. This is the result of my sleepless nights of my work, dangers that I ran. Well, I'll stay with you to brave your fury! I support Barere's proposal. Let's decree that the French Republic be one and indivisible. When I came back to me, I heard : It is decreed that public acts will now bear the date of the first year of the French Republic. Republic. The Republic. Here we are. They must listen to us, otherwise it's ... it is Danton who will be right. And tomorrow will be always more terrible. Head up. What are you doing, with the oven? The fool ? Marat is crazy, but without him the Revolution would be lukewarm water. I'm talking to you about the oven. It turns off. What do we do ? I'm not sure I'm the best to see in the future. What, God? Do you think God approves us? He would support tyrants and the counter-revolutionaries? These vermin who are plotting, put crushed glass in the flours and we are attacking the borders. Cum! Obviously that God approves the Revolution! He would not support equality, the new rights? Solange, you'll see. The intoxication of freedom will spread in all hearts. And the September dead? These, peace to their souls. I place the order for the wood. Approach. A. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. You are not ready. I thought you were harder. The floor is Saint-Just citizen. I say that the King must be judged as an enemy. That we have less to judge him only to fight him From people to king, I do not know of a natural relationship. Citizens bind themselves by the contract. The sovereign does not bind himself. For me, I do not see a medium. This man must reign or die. Think again, Mr. Saint-Just. Judge the King would be the least dignities. He oppressed a free nation. He declared himself his enemy. He abused the laws. He must die to ensure the people's rest, since it was in his views to overwhelm the people to secure his. One can not reign innocently. Every king is a rebel and an usurper. He is the murderer of the Bastille, of Nancy, the Champ-de-Mars, the Tuileries! Which enemy, which stranger hurt us more? We seek to stir up pity We will soon buy tears. We will do everything to interest ourselves, to corrupt us, even! The floor is for citizen Fauchet. Here I invoke, citizens, this same justice eternal of nature, whose laws are prior to all social laws. You promise us the rest of the Homeland in the national crime? Mr. St-Just, your homeland rest is a bloody infamous that would horror ... to all the earth. You must be able hold twenty seconds. Twenty seconds, what is it? Compared to your years Troll-misery? Twenty seconds to eat your hunger. Eleven. Twelve. Thirteen. Fourteen. Fifteen. Sixteen. Go drink. Citizens, the Assembly has been dragged away from the real question. There is no here trial to be made. Louis is not an accused. You are not judges. You do not have a sentence to render for or against a man. But a measure of public safety to take, a national act of providence to exercise. The trial of the tyrant, it is the insurrection. His judgment, it is the fall of his power. His sentence, the one he demands the freedom of the people. That he kills kings, but he does not set himself up as a king himself. Silence, Brissot's friends! Peoples do not judge like the courts. They render no sentence. They launch the lightning. They do not condemn kings. They plunge them back into nothingness. For me, you know, I abhor the death penalty lavished by your laws. I asked abolition of the death sentence to the Assembly which you still name constituting. And I do not have for Louis neither love nor hate. I only hate his packages. I regretfully say this fatal truth: Louis must die. - No, Mr. Robespierre! Because the country must live. I request that the National Convention declares him a traitor to the French nation. Criminal against humanity. I ask that, as such, he gives a great example to the world, in the same place where died on August 10 ... the generous martyrs of freedom. So ? What gives? It missed. Start again. Slowly. Not too much. Not too much, I tell you! And to know the traitors, because there are some in this assembly, Name them! And to know the traitors, to know them with certainty, I propose you an infallible means. It is that the death of the tyrant be voted by roll call. And that this roll call be published. The day of judgment is approaching. Have the courage to tell the truth. The truth burns silently in all hearts like a fiery lamp in a tomb. The roll call can begin. The question is asked in these terms : What a pain Louis, before King of the French, he incurred? The draw having decided on the letter G, it will be in the department of the Garonne to pronounce first. I believe that... the tyrant will harm us more by his death that by the continuation of his shameful existence. I conclude for seclusion until peace and for banishment at that time. Citizens, I go down in my conscience ... The people... is not allowed... to slaughter a conquered prisoner. It is said that the courts of Europe, the Austrians, Prussia, England, Spain, sent to Paris their most beautiful whores to bribe the deputies. Everyone is master of his bed, no one from his tomb. I would fear that Louis' head did not open by falling the abyss of passions and the volcanoes of ambition. I fear anarchy and that's enough to remove from my mind any idea of ​​death. Regular. Slowly. At ... a free and generous nation, death is an outrage to humanity. I have neither father nor son to avenge. But a hundred thousand of my fellow citizens. The death. To do something strong, solid, it takes better than time. It must be sweet. The sweetness of the gesture, you understand ? I do not like long speeches in the obvious questions. They are a sinister omen for freedom. I vote for death. I'm not from this crowd of statesmen who do not know that one does not compose with the tyrants. Who do not know that no one is hitting kings only to the head. I vote for the death of the tyrant. Death within twenty-four hours. Manuel in his opinion of November said: A dead king, he is not a man less. I vote for death. Too late, maybe, for the honor of the Convention. In the intimate conviction where I am, that Louis is the main author of the packages who blew so much blood on August 10th. And of all the massacres who have defiled France since the Revolution. I vote for the death of the tyrant within twenty-four hours. Only... concerned about my duty. Convinced that all those who have waited or will wait ... to the sovereignty of the people deserve death, I vote for death. - The monster ! - His godfather ! His own blood! The tree of freedom, said an elder, grows when watered blood of all kinds of tyrants. The death of Louis XVI is in my deepest conviction the tomb of public liberty. And the triumph enemies of my homeland. I vote for banishment. The death. Since Louis XVI was the enemy of the people, of his freedom and happiness, I conclude at his death. The penalty against the conspirators is death. This punishment is against my principles. I will never vote for it. I am convinced that Louis is guilty. But his death, though right, seems to me to have dangers that does not have its conservation. I vote for death, but by adhering to the stay. The vote is closed. We will proceed to its counting. I protest. Missing a member 370 votes for the immediate death of Louis. 319 for banishment. I declare on behalf of the Convention that the sentence she pronounced against Louis Capet is death. She is perfect. Here we are. We succeeded by God! Stop moving your tongue or I tear it out! Perjury! I pity your souls! Vermin! Veroleuse! Enough ! Enough ! You're going to shut up, yes? Come on, enough. Enough ! I pity your souls! Now who is going to wash the feet of the poor on Holy Thursday? We will all be Sans-culottes and without a head! The revolution give them hooves! The beautiful joke. You are monsters, criminals. Kill our King. But by what right? By what pride? What a shame ! How sad ! You deserve the rocking dance! Landelle, where is the evil? The evil is nostalgic. You? In a thousand years, you will repent of it again. Blessed be my rock! May he triumph, the god of my victory! This god who grants me revenge, Who submits to my power the nations. You deliver me from all enemies. You make me triumph over the aggressor. You tear me away from the violence of the man. So I will give thanks to you among the peoples. Lord, I will celebrate your name. Just run me as I am here. I fear the impossible thing. Pay attention. It slips. He's fat. He is tall. Where is my people? My good people? Shut up ! Shut up ! I die innocent. Executioner, do not tremble! The universe is watching you! Long live the Nation! It is too fast ! It was better before ! Before they would have crushed her bones. They would have thrown his ashes in the wind. For my last judgment. In the Republic, the blood of a king brings good luck. Marie. Maria Pique. Equality. A child of 92.
