We'll be in the mountains in 3 hours. Be there between 2 and 3 o'clock. Hey! What the hell are you doing? Death in the family, bro. License and registration. You made it? Ten by ten, or sixty centimeters? No idea. Come with me. - Milka! - Yes, boss? I'll be on my cell. A new group is coming on Sunday night. I'll let you know at what time. Buy yourself a wallet for fuck's sake! I can't stand the way you treat money. Good afternoon. Can I help you? I spoke with the owner. He told me you got some new tiles in, Italian. All the tiles in our store are Italian, sir. Yeah, sure. China is Italy in your store. For the kitchen or the bathroom? Which ones do you like? You seem to be an artistic type. It depends on the style of your apartment. European. Italian semi-porcelain. You can use them on the floor and the walls with these decorative... You're an Aquarius, right? No. I'm certain you're either Aquarius or Pisces. It's Italian porcelain, a 100-year warranty... Can you guess what my sign is? I don't know. Well, guess... How much are those? These are 63 euros. For a square meter? A piece. Listen, sweetie, the price is never a concern for me. Why don't we arrange for you come to my place and see which tile fits best? As an expert. I'll pay for the extra service, of course. I see. Let me check when my colleague's available. He's the one who provides that extra service. Have a good day. People, forgive me, but I have to leave now. I have a few more houses to go to. Bravo, Father! God bless you all! Love and prosper in this house! Amen, Father! May we all see each other again next year. Thank you, Father. God bless you. You always do this to me. You can't even come home on time for Observance Day. Laze, bro, sit over here, let's have a glass of whiskey. Cheers! So, how's work, bro? Mine sucks... I deal with controls and inspections all the time. Not enough passengers. It's really bad. - Soccer player, how are you? - Good. Tell your uncle where you're going. To a soccer camp. Next month they're going to Krushevo. He's the new Pandev. He's the most talented in his club. Bravo. Stop exaggerating, you'll spoil the kid. Here, nephew. Buy yourself something. Laze, please, there's no need for that. If he wants to give the boy something, he should. He's his uncle. What do you say? Thank you, uncle. Can I ask a favor? Sure. For Toni... Dani... I don't decide who gets to drive. I'm asking for help, not for mercy. - Buy you a drink? - No, thanks, I have one. - Another? - No, thanks. Hi, I'm Tegla. Kate's boyfriend. Do we know each other? Lazar. Why alone? My friends don't listen to this music. Oh, but you do? I knew you would be here. I wanted to see you. At least you're honest. Your boyfriend is really jealous. He's not my boyfriend. We grew up together. In that case, I'm jealous. Enjoy the music. I'd like to see you again. We'll see. - Good morning. - Good morning. Is it too much for you to stay home one night? Where do you even go every single night? Why don't you want to help your sister? Can't you see how she struggles? Don't you care? Or doesn't it bother you? You just take care of yourself. How can I help her? What am I, Prime Minister? Yes, you can. You can take Toni to drive with you. Toni... What's wrong with that? You should help your brother-in-law. You're just like your father. Don't be afraid! Go for the ball! Come on, Zlate! Go, son! Hold on to it! Come on, kick it! You're the new guy? Yes. I'm Tsona. Toni. Laze told me you're his brother-in-law. - Yes. - Great. Nervous? Yes. Well, relax then. The worst thing that could happen to you... is to suffocate... from the stench of those camel-fuckers! Listen... You just follow me... and do what I do. Move, move! Let's go. Go, go. Guys, this is Lazar. Hi, Lazar. I'm glad you came. Yeah, he'll make a good clown. Tegla! I haven't done this since I was a kid. Why? Okay, it might seem a bit silly but... You look great. Where do you live? At "Star Konak" with my mom. With your mom? I would have laid bets that you lived alone. I didn't want to abandon her. She must be very proud of you. I'm not so sure about that. Why? Because. Because of what? Just because. And your dad? My dad... He left for Germany... when I was 9. And when I was 12... he disappeared. What do you mean? He stopped calling. At that time, there were... no computers or internet. When you lose contact with someone... it's over. Then, a few years ago, a postcard arrived from Frankfurt. He had remarried. - For real? - Yes. He has a son. I hope he's happy. I'm sorry. It's okay. I can't remember the last time I felt like this. Felt like what? Different. Well, bye, Lazar. Bye. I think your dad is looking for you. Excuse me. What's up, kid? So, you're screwing the tile-ist? She good? Get in. I'll come by later. I said, get in! We have work to do. Go buy her another Coke and say you'll see her later. I gotta go. I'm sorry. I got the bill. Just go. I'll see you later. This Greek guy works with large numbers. 50, 60 people at a time, but it won't last. Greece is fucked up. They have more than a million down there. We'll need to score some vans. Vans stick out like a sore thumb at night. It'd be better with more drivers. You're right. Son, if we tie in the Greek, we're moving up to first class. Red... give us some ice, dude. Miki... Don't get me wrong, but I need to chill out for a bit. I need some time to get my shit together. - What's the problem? - No, there's no problem. I just thought we should train Tsona. He's a pro. Smart guy. Those are the worst. How's your mom? You give her money? I told Rocky to bring the Greek over tonight. So we get to know each other. Tonight? Here? You'll need to bring "the Party". Now? Make sure to be back by 10. Here. Take the Jeep. Laze... Hey, bro. Hey, Laze, care for a game? I'm not in the mood. Give me a tequila. - Where did you go? - I was in Sofia. I know a guy there who arranges everything for 500 euros. No muss, no fuss. His name is Gencho. I'll give you his number. Gencho? He'll take care of everything for a friend. Lazo, you okay, bro? - So? - I'm off to Denmark, bro. On a cruise boat. 2,000 euros per month. Republic of Bulgaria of the European Union. Always in some great unions, this mother Bulgaria. Go fuck yourself, Tsona! Eat shit, loser! Fucking nationalist. "The Party" has arrived! Call me when you are done. Stay! Don't even think about leaving. Hey, that would be a crime against nature. Right, Miki? Next time, Rocky. Next time doesn't exist. Rocky, don't fuck with me. I gotta go. Give me your hand, little girl. You have the right to remain silent. Don't be a pussy, stay for a bit, and I'll let you go. Miki is like a father to me. I told him I want to quit. But I have to wait till he finds my replacement. What do you do for him? Katerina... let's go away. Let's have a fresh start. Clean. I want to have a normal life. With you. I can pay for everything. Okay, and where will we go? Anywhere you want, Prague, Paris... And? And that's it. I'm sorry, but you sound like a 15-year old. So, what happens to my plans? To what I want? I want to go back to university and graduate. London, Paris, that sounds great. But what'll I do when we get there? And what do you do here? Sell tiles. Fuck you! Katerina! I'm sorry. Miki... I'm thinking of going to university. University? What university? Physics. Okay. And? Look, son, you and I make money with our balls. Right here, right now. We don't need to wander through corridors for 10 years. And then for another 10, through some other corridors. Only to realize in the end we can't pay our electricity bill. That's for pussies. You know what's ironic? The pussies that go to university think that they are smarter than us. But while we enjoy our lives right here and right now, they dream they will have a better life in some other time... which doesn't exist. So you tell me who's smarter. If you want to study, okay. You study. I'll pay for everything. But if you dump me for some bitch... you'll break my heart. The plant... How many girlfriends did you have? Not very many. How many? A few short relationships... and... And? And one big crush in high school. Why did you break up? I wasn't a good prospect. Actually, I fucked it up. And you? Me? Two serious relationships. The first one in high school. He dumped me two weeks after we had sex. The second one in university. He had a band. We were supposed to play together. I thought we had something special. But... But? But it turned out that he had something special with another girl at the same time. And? And I packed my bags and came back to Shtip. It's sad how much people are afraid to be alone... but they keep lying to each other, which essentially keeps them apart. I promised myself that I won't live a lie. What's wrong with your phone? I dunno. Must be the battery. I've been calling for hours, you son of a bitch! Who led the group to the border tonight? - Tsona. - And you? Bravo. A bunch of our men got busted. Euro police monitor the border 24/7 now. Internal Affairs is breathing down my neck. I called Miki right away to stop the transfer. He tried to reach you, but you were... I'll send two fuckers to your tile-ist. You'll find her in the hospital. You fucked us big time, Laze. Now they know where the crossing is. They put infrared cameras everywhere. Until when? You fucked up everything! If we stop now, the whole business goes to Albania. - What about the Vardar River? - Swim across? I dunno. Are there cameras there? I have no idea. I have to check. Check. Dobre will take them across. There's no turning back now. You have to send someone to help him. He can't handle it alone. When the camel-fuckers see the river, they'll shit themselves. - Of course. - Who? Your brother-in-law. You trust him? Down the river... In 5 minutes, Greece. European Union. Toni... Give them the canisters. Come on! Move, move! So, those are the Greeks, huh? No, that's our side. The Greeks are further down. Come on. You know, I've never been to Greece. No? To be honest, I've never been outside Macedonia. Not even Serbia? No. Once, me and my wife planned to go on a summer vacation in Turkey. But that year, I was laid off work. Some foreigners bought the factory for a pittance and more than 300 people were out! Fucking gangsters. Zlate! - Mom... - Yes? - Is Zlate home? - I think so. Zlate... Come see what your daddy bought. A new car. Come quickly. Go on, it's open. Let's take it for a spin. You'll have to pay the piper one day. What kind of man are you? You envy your own son. What's there to be envious of? If you had earned it, I might be envious. It breaks my heart that you'll only ruin the kid. Shut up! It breaks my heart that you've never said "bravo" to me for anything. Care for a ride? - I don't need... - Eat your words, old man! What do you think, son? Let's go for a ride. Listen to this engine. Hello, neighbor! Fuck your sister, bum. They're all suckers! Keep up the good work! Sorry-ass slaves. Hey warrior. - Zdravko, bro. - Hey Toni, bro. - How are you? - Okay. - Did they release you? - In my dreams. Guilty as charged. I'm filing an appeal to buy time, but I'll have to go to jail anyway. Son, go grab us some tickets. 5 years, bro. They repossessed my car plus legal costs. Toni, bro, I left my kids penniless. Son, go wait for me in the car. How did it happen? When someone's thinking with his dick... I'll do jail time. What about you? Whose car is that? Denationalization. Well, that's a miracle if ever I've seen one. Zdravko, I have to take the kid home. - Can I give you a ride? - No. I have nowhere to go. I sit here so I'm not at home. I can't look them in the eye. - See you again, bro. - Bye. Faster! Faster! Fuck! Is he okay? What happened? He dropped the canister. Toni, grab his legs! Dobre, give them the canisters! We're not taking him to the hospital? Toni, shut the fuck up! - Laze, what'll we do? - Shut the fuck up! Now what? If we take him to the hospital, we're fucked. They'll put us in jail. Hey, I have a wife and a kid. We're not doing time for a camel-fucker. Miki will kill us all. Laze... He's dead. Good. Hot air goes up, therefore the floors get cold fast. You burn so much electricity, but it's cold on your feet, too. And since I never wear socks in the winter, whenever I step on the tiles in the bathroom... Ouch! Open it. Thanks. When you take chicks out, you'll look like a gentleman. And not like some peasant. Let's get a drink. You're buying. Miki... I have to do some stuff. Errands for my mom. What do you need to do? I'll come with you. No need. It's for my mother. Is she okay? Yes, she's fine. Bro, where did you go? Your phone is dead. What do you want? You made us all worried, your mother, your sister, me... Laze, wait! What's going on? When do we drive again? No more driving. What do you mean? - Time for you to chill out. - What are you talking about? - Is there a problem? - No problem. Give your son a chance, get another job. Hey, leave my son out of this! Got a problem with me? Let's deal with it. Zlate's nothing to do with it. I want you to give me Miki's number. I told you it's over! I owe a lot of money. I have to drive. It's not for me. I'm doing it for Zlate. Please. How much? 12,000 euros. What the fuck is your problem? Why all this? 'Cause of the Arab? You're nuts. No one forced him to go down the river. He would've probably died in Greece anyway. He was dead when we pulled him out. No, he wasn't. I'm not good for you. I know what you do. It's sad how little you know me. It's all your brother's fault! How is it my brother's fault? I was always loyal to him, and what did he do? He fucked things up and ran away. And now I'm screwed! What're you talking about? Laze lost it. One of the Arabs drowned. Laze hasn't been the same. He'll betray us all. We have to call Miki... Are you out of your mind? D'you know who you're talking about? Lazar's like a brother to me. If you weren't his brother-in-law... I'd smash your head in. Do you think this is easy for me? Lazar is family. But he's not the same guy anymore. When was the last time you spoke to him, worked with him? How long have you been out of the loop? 2 weeks? 3? Is that normal? - Hello. Evgenij. - Lazar. Let me see. Good. This is for you. Read it very carefully. And most important: you claim your grandparents were Bulgarian. That's the most important thing. So? Where is Lazar? Where is Lazar? Toni Rozanovski! Lazar Jovanovski! Come on in. Take the elevator. Fifth floor. Office 744. Lazar Jovanovski. (Bulgarian dialect) Jovanovski, yes. (Macedonian dialect) When was your grandfather born? Where? - In Shtip. - Shtip? Is he Bulgarian? Yes. And your grandmother? Same. What countries border Bulgaria? Macedonia, Turkey, Greece... Romania, Serbia. Good. What are Bulgaria's national holidays? March 3rd... May 24th... You don't know them. Okay. What were the Bulgarian capitals throughout history? - Sofia. - Good. - Veliko Trnovo. - Very good. Ohrid... Skopje... Pliska, Preslav... Have you learned "I'm a little Bulgarian" by Ivan Vazov? I'm a little Bulgarian I love our mountains so green To be called a Bulgarian Is the greatest joy for me Come on, repeat after me. I'm a little Bulgarian... I'm a little Bulgarian... Katerina! Call an ambulance!
