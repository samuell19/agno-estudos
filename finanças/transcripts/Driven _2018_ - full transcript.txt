[instrumental music] Man 1: You follow the rules and we're through. Man 2: Let's go. Come on. Move back. Man 3: You're surrounded, fellows. [indistinct chatter] Man 3: When answering your questions, we've made a statement and you should need to be satisfied with that. Man 4: We all know of course that this case has had a great deal of publicity. The lawyers involved in this case... Man 5: Not a word! Man 6: You should bear in mind that much of what you see and read is propaganda from the prosecution. It's not a fair appraisal of what in fact occurred. Man 6: Some of it is downright false. [instrumental music] Benedict: Stay focused. Stay calm. Stay honest. Look them in the eye. Be polite. Be respectful. Listen to the questions. Think about your answers. Take your time, but not too much time. Give the detail... not too much detail, they'll confuse. Don't stare at the jury, don't joke with the jury, don't flirt with the jury. They're your mother, they're your father. They are your fucking future. [music continues] [airplane droning] [tires screeching] What is happening? Ellen: What is going on? Jim: I don't know. FBI, please vacate the aircraft. - What is going on, Jim? Jim: It's... I'm sure it's some sort of misunderstanding or-- - Mr. Hoffman, please vacate... - Why do you know his name? Benedict: Make no sudden moves. - Why do they know your name? Honey. Vacate the aircraft! We are vacating the aircraft, okay. Let them do their job. - I don't know. - It's alright. Maybe they're confused or something. Ellen: Probably just some accident. Jim: It's kind of cool. How old are you guys? Huh? - Kind of cool, right? - Babe. Benedict: Mr. Hoffman, you're under arrest. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in the court of law. Benedict: Any-- - What are you doing? Man 3: Anything you say-- - We are on vacation! These are my children! - If you need a lawyer-- - We're at Disney Land, asshole! Oh, fuck it, just take them away. What are you doing with my husband? Jim! [kids imitating gunshots] [Ellen sighs] So, tell me about them? [sighs] What can I say? They were a nice couple. A nice Christian couple. This nice Christian couple we can find no trace of? Oh, I can be held responsible for that now, can I? I'm a pilot, man. I make a living transporting shit. I-- it's all in the manifest. Sorry, I-- I don't know what you want from me here. Here's the thing, Hoffman. I meet scumbags like you all the time. You're the sort of guy if you could make a 1000 bucks honest or ten bucks doing it crooked you'd do it crooked every time. I-- I bet you, you'd fuck your own mother for a quarter. [laughs] If you're trying to charm me, sir, you're not doing a great job-- But worse than fucking your own mother you'd fuck your own kids? You take them on a drug run? - That is the lowest. - I took them to Disney World. - You took them to Bolivia. - To deliver Bibles. Okay, I thought they would have fun. Except it turns out that Bolivia is a shithole. So, we took them to Disney World on the way back. You took them to Bolivia as cover and you picked up so much coke you thought you'd celebrate in Disney on the way back. Okay, Ben, listen to me. Don't call me Ben. It said, Ben, on your badge. It says, Benedict J. Tisa, special agent in charge Federal Bureau of Investigation. Special agent in charge? I like that. I like you, you know. And I really like your suit. You look great, you're the best dressed guy here. You know that. Dressed for the job you want, right? Okay, look, special agent in charge I swear to you on my life I knew nothing about any of this. [intense music] Seems like you got a sweet family out there. Benedict: But you're not gonna see them for 30 years. So, do yourself a favor. [telephone ringing] Good lookin' fellow. I don't know who this other guy is though. You know exactly who it is, because Morgan Hetrick-- Man 8: Sir? [indistinct chatter] You landed in Pensacola, Florida. You subleased out your plane and it was out of your possession for three nights. Three magical nights at Disney World, yes. Are we done here? - So, that's it? - That's it, yeah. Yeah, I mean I had the paperwork, you know you can't argue with paperwork. Jim, some of those people that you work with I do not think have your best interest in mind. I agree, no, I-- I think, uh Bolivia was a pretty big clue, huh? - This is a wake up call. - It's a wake up call. - We need to start fresh. - Somewhere new, absolutely. This time I'm gonna pick where. - No, no, no, no. No. - Yeah. We'll put it to a vote. What do you mean we're gonna vote? We're not gonna vote. Yes, we will put it to a vote, we live in a democracy. No, no, no, no. No, you think you live in a democracy. All in favor of mom choosing where we live next. Jim: Oh, hey, guys, come on, think about it. We're gonna end up livin' in some dump. You know, your mom has no taste. She married you. [laughing] [instrumental music] [music continues] Yeah? It's a really nice neighborhood, honey. Yeah, don't worry, it'll be fine. Only the best for my family. Go ahead, door's open. Go in, check it out. Howard: Mr. Hoffman. Who are you exactly? - Well, I'm not really-- - No, no, no. Don't answer that, Mr. Hoffman. It was a rhetorical question. So, we're to find out exactly who you are, we're gonna find out what wasn't quite forthcoming with the prosecution evidence. Pauma valley, it's beautiful up there. Not cheap though, is it? Sorry, do you want me to answer that one? [crowd laughing] - Yes. - No, sir, not cheap. - You have a mortgage? Renting? - Renting. - And what's the rent like? - Sixteen hundred a month. [whistles] That's, uh, that's a lot of money. Why don't we take a quick look at your, your IRS returns, see how you can, uh, afford such, uh, a nice spread in Pauma valley. What would you say, at random, you filed for in 1980? I did not file in 1980. Did you file in 1979? - No, sir, I did not. - 1978? - No, sir. - '77? 1977? [crowd laughing] You think this is funny, Mr. Hoffman? [chuckles] No, sir. You do realize that it is illegal not to file a tax return? Yes, sir. But you did file in 1982. How come? Just tryin' to do the right thing. Well, there is a first time for everything. [laughter] [humming] Boy 1: You're in prison. Boy 2: Yeah, try to escape. Boy 3: Try to escape. Try to escape. Yeah, just keep distracting her. Hey! Guys, what's going on here? Dad, dad, o-- okay if we go play in their pool? - Please. - Please let us play. Hold on, buddy, I mean, these guys look like trouble if you ask me. - Mom? - It's time to go home. - Mommy. - Hi, my love. Cristina: Good, good, good. Hi, I hope they're not being a nuisance. No, not at all, no. More than welcome. Oh, we haven't had a chance to welcome you to the neighborhood. We're always coming and going. Cristina. Oh, I'm... Sorry. Uh, hey. Hi, Jim. Hi. Mom, can they come swim with us? It's alright with me if that's alright with their dad. Yeah, no, of course. They're very good. - Thank you so much. - Yeah, no problem. - Ni-- nice to meet you. - Let's go! Come on. Come on, baby. Mommy. Are we going? Am I gonna try on my new bathing suit now? Aye-aye-yay! [instrumental music] [engine cranking] Come on. - Damn it. John: That's a nice looking car. O-- oh! Yeah, thanks. John: 389 cubic inch V-8 engine. Three double barrel carburetors, speed, performance, handling. Back in the day... the girls loved it. Would you mind if I, uh... Yeah, be my guest. Yeah, there she is. Alright. Turn it over. Okay. [engine cranking] [laughs] How the hell did you do that? Ah, beginner's luck. And I designed it. You designed it? What, what, you designed what? What, you designed the GTO? Holy shit. Holy shit. You're John DeLorean, aren't you? [laughs] Amazing. Well, that, I... Hey, great job on this, you know. I mean, Shakespeare writes a play, he at least gets to put his name on it. Well, I might do that yet. Yeah. Uh... Hey, hold on a second, okay? Will you? I'll be right back. Don't go anywhere. Jim: Where are the beers? Ellen: In the fridge! Jim: No, I'm in the fridge here. Wait, wait, wait, wait. I got 'em. I got 'em. Thank you. - You a pilot? - Um... Here you go. - I-- I used to be. - Good. You know, it's been a long time since I got my hands dirty. Well, I mean, you know, if it's in the blood it's in the blood. Ha, John DeLorean! In my house? It's something else. Uh, so, I mean, what are you... What are you doing now? You-- you still over at the GM, yeah? No, I got out of that racket. Now, I'm working on something for myself. Um. Nice. Nice. Good for you. What, um, may I ask, um... She still doesn't sound right. So what, they, they won't let you do your own thing over a Pontiac? Oh, Christ, no. General Motors. Ford. Chrysler. There's hasn't been a single honest to God innovation in 20 years, all they do is tinker. They'll, uh, smooth a corner or automate a wiper and hype it as some great new model. Oh! Oh-oh. Better get that. - But it's all just bullshit. - Oh, where are you? Oh, here it is. Ah! Shit! Shh! - You alright? - Yeah. I cut myself. Fucking rust bucket. Take this. Oh. Thanks. I think you'll live. John: Rust. Every car in America is dying the minute it leaves the factory. But my car... now my car is... My car will be made of brushed stainless steel. Rear mounted engine. The underbody will be made of two large molded parts. uh, the frame and the body are one and it's made of of stainless steel, you see, so, it'll last forever. It'll be safest car on the road. - Mm. - And, um, and airbags, Jim. - Do you know about airbags? - Uh, no. I want this car under 2200 pounds. 0 to 60 in 8 seconds. 20 miles per gallon in the city, 30 miles per gallon on the highway. I want a suspension system that is designed by a computer. And the doors, Jim... The doors... Heh. - They're gull-winged. - Oh, yeah. - Right? - Look at this, they're some... Oh, sorry, um... Yeah, it's like science fiction or something. It's the future. - They lift straight up. - Oh. Right? You can park it almost anywhere. It's more expensive 'cause you've got to counter balance it against gravity, but it's worth it. Sure, sure, so, you just kinda come up with, like, uh an affordable anti-gravity device. And, uh... I-- I-- I don't know what I'm talking about. - Oh. - Ha-ha-ha... - Well, just you wait. - Oh, yeah. He-he. So what are you you doing on Friday? [instrumental music] So, guess what? We got invited to a party on Friday. - Oh. - Yeah. So why don't you... Um, yeah, get your hair done. - Whatever you say, Rockefeller. Jim: Ha-ha. ¶ Let your body go you know you can do it ¶ ¶ Like me ee meenie minie mo there's really nothin' to it ¶ ¶ Dance let your body go you know you can do it ¶ ¶ Like me ee meenie minie mo there's really nothin' to it ¶ ¶ You can do it and you know... ¶¶ - Hey. How's it hangin', Ben? - Don't call me Ben. Benedict: I'm Special Agent. Special Agent. Okay. You don't make your wife call you that at home, do you? You really wanna talk wives, Jim? I don't know why you bother with the charade, it'd be a lot less stress if you just told her what you're really doing to pay the bills. What doesn't pay the bills, Special Agent? Well, it's your choice if you want to live high end on the pay of a low end snitch. I'm not a snitch, you know? I'm a paid employee of the United States government. That's what I said. - Just coffee, thanks. - Okay. Um, I'll take half a grapefruit please. And the smallest scone you got. Alright. So, what's it been, Jim? A couple of months? Yeah, yeah, something like that. Yeah. Settling in alright? You-- you like the house okay? - Oh, I love the house. - Kids happy in school? Uh, I mean, as happy as any kid during school, right?. Getting along with the neighbors okay? Oh, yeah, getting along great. You know John DeLorean actually lives on our block. - All sounds pretty idyllic. - Yeah? Yeah. No, it is. It's pretty idyllic. Do you think something's missing missing from this equation now? Something a little... imbalanced? Yeah, I don't know. Maybe. I... Maybe? Listen. We're not in the business of arresting every street corner dealer that catches your eye. We've got bigger fish to fry. Uh, no. No, no, no. Hey, look. I told ya, I can't go there, okay? The guy'll kill me. Well, there's two versions of the Morgan Hetrick story. Version one, he's your pal, and yet he sent you to Bolivia and he hid a shitload of coke in your plane. Or you're in cahoots. Your buddy organizes more flights than Pan-Am. He flies in half the coke that comes into California. Your buddy, Morgan Hetrick, has millions sitting in the Cayman Islands he can't access and we'd like to get our hands on it. So, you have a choice. You work with us on this, we bring him in, you go free. You say no, we fuck you out of your nice house, you go to prison, your wife goes to prison as an accessory and your kids go in to the system. [dramatic music] Actually, you don't have a choice. ¶ I'm lucky so lucky ¶ Jim: Boy, look at this place. How is this house across the street from our house? Hi... - Well, not bad. - Jim. - Hi. - How are you doing? - Good. How are you? - Oh. - Great. - Heh-heh. Hi, I'm Cristina, I'm John's wife. - Ellen. - So great to meet you. You look so lovely. Well, let me introduce you. - Come on. - Okay. Um... - Ladies, this is Ellen. - Hi. Ellen's Jim is in the airline business. - Oh, neat. - Yes. We just moved in across the street. - Oh. - Oh, lovely. - Hi. Uh, can I get a drink? Man 7: Yes, sir. Um, whiskey on the rocks, please. [indistinct chatter] Bill: Ladies and gentlemen! Come out of the bar! Come out of the half rooms. Gather around. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to introduce you to a man who needs no introduction. The most successful auto executive in living memory. The youngest ever, head of a division at General Motors and now founder of the DeLorean Motor Company, I give you Mr. John DeLorean. - Thank you. - Glad to meet you. It's good to see you here. Oh, hey, thank you so much. Well, thank you, Bill. Thank you, all. Um... Boy, it's lovely to see you all here, um, but you know there's no such thing as a free beer... [laughter] So you'll have to listen to me bang the drum for our new car. [laughter] I know some of you haven't signed up yet, and I wanted to show you something I received in the mail today. - It's a check... - Ooh. From a new investor for $600,000. - Wow. - Yeah. And, uh, what's the name on that check? It's a Mr. Johnny Carson. [cheering] And that's all well and good, but I... You know I wanted to get serious for a minute. In the America I grew up in, a man was defined by the work he did. But there was precious little work to be had. Very few opportunities. [instrumental music] But that didn't stop me from dreaming. My father, oh, he knew hard times. But he was a smart man. He said, "It's okay to dream as long as you combine those dreams with hard work." When I was 14, he bought this battered down, old Chevy and took it apart into 500 pieces on our front lawn. He said, "Son, if you can put that car back together, then it's yours." And that's exactly what I did. Three days and nights it took me. I didn't eat or sleep, but I did it. And when it was done... that car drove like a dream. And that is my intention with the DeLorean motorcar, to build a dream car, something the great American public can aspire to owning. Ladies and gentlemen, it is my great pleasure to present to you the latest design for the DeLorean motor car. Uh, Roy, Bill. [dramatic music] [crowd gasping] [cheering] [all gasping] [cheering] We're going to design a car, we're going to build a factory, we are going to create 2000 jobs, we are going to produce 30,000 cars a year and we are going to do it all in 18 months. If you haven't signed up yet, what are you waiting for? [cheering] - Nice job. - Roy. You know that's so amazing... Everybody... [chuckles] You really think he can pull this off? - Oh, I know he can. - Yeah? How long you been working with him? Since the very beginning. John: Hey, good to see you. Good to see you. I want you take a look at that car. It's a good looking car. Thank you. [instrumental music] [inhales deeply] [sighs] ¶ Tu-ru-rut tu tu-ru ¶ ¶ Winner take all ¶ ¶ Winner take all ¶ ¶ Winner take all ¶ ¶ Winner take all... ¶ [both chuckle] Uh, what do you say we go home and see what happens? Yeah, it's starting to rain in here. Mm-hm. - It's the DeLoreans. - Okay, okay. [clears throat] Thank you so much for a lovely evening. Oh, thank you. It was lovely to finally have you over. - It's a beautiful house. - Oh, thanks. - Really. Absolutely. - Jim, right? - Yes, sir. - Bill Mercer. Vice president of whatever the fuck he has me doing next. - That's my wife, Ellen. - Hi. Why don't you join us downstairs? We're just lettin' our hair down, now that the pressure's off. Oh, yeah. Uh-- uh, that'd be great. - You're okay with that, right? - Yeah, fine. I'll see you tonight. [chuckling] That husband of yours is quite the charmer. Only until you get to know him. After tonight, we have 175 dealers signed up. That's $25,000 each, plus a commitment to take 100 cars in the first year. It needs to be 250, 300. We'll get there, John. It's a done deal. - Nice shot. - He-he-he. You serve. What so funny? Guys, I've been around, I know when I'm being pitched. Uh-- uh, look, I-- I-- I know I'm living in a nice house in a swanky neighborhood, but, uh, I'm behind on the rent and I don't know where next month's is coming from, so if you're looking for an investment from me, you might be, uh... Well, you're barking up the wrong tree. [tapping bat] Well, fuck you then. [chuckles] [chuckles] [indistinct chatter on TV] [all laughing] If you're runnin' low on cash, maybe you'd like to earn some. - Ooh. Ooh-ooh. - Oh? Sure, I'm always up for a little table tennis. You mean, ping-pong? Yeah. I call it table tennis. Jim, it's ping-pong. Alright. Alright, 50 bucks if you can take a point off me. Hmm, I believe I might be getting hustled here, sir, huh? How do you hold this thing? Is this right? - Yeah, exactly like that. - Am I doing this right? Stop fuckin' around, come on. Bill: Alright, John. Alright. [ball clacking] Ooh! [instrumental music] Uh-oh. Oh, no, John, John, come on. Don't worry about it. I mean, hell, it's only table tennis, right? Let me walk you out. You know, Jim, I'm sorry you're havin' a hard time. And if there's anything I can do to help, you let me know. Oh, yeah. No, I mean, I got a few things cookin'. But, uh, I mean, it should all work out, but thank you for the thought. Ah, that's what friends are for. Yeah. You know, the thing about ping-pong... When the game first came to America it was trademarked ping-pong by these guys, the Parker Brothers. And they kept a strict control over that name, but it still made it into the lexicon. It's not a car. It's not a sports car. It's a DeLorean. Hmm. Yeah. You don't hang out much, do you? Well, uh... [chuckles] - I travel a lot. I do. - Yeah. Hey, speakin' of which, do you want me to keep an eye on the house when you guys are gone? You know, like clean the pool or... This area probably turns into a jungle-- Well, that would be, um... Alright, I-- I can arrange payment. No, no, John, John, come on. You don't have to pay me. Really. It's okay. Thank you, Jim. Hey, that's what friends are for. I'm kidding, come here. There it is. Friends hug. Alright, uh, please tell Cristina thank you from both me and Ellen. [instrumental music] Check, check, check. Jim: Hi, I was looking for Morgan. - Who wants to know? - Jim. Jim Hoffman. I'll go check. [recorder malfunctioning] Check, check, check, check... What? - What's that? - Check. Please go check, yeah. Thank you. Alright. [dramatic music] [clears throat] - He says, come on in. - Oh, well, I mean, you know... If he's busy, I can always come back another time. Morgan: Get in here! Okay, yeah. Jim Hoffman. Hey, Morgan, hi. - Long time, Jim. - Uh, the place looks great. You know, so do you. Um, so, you still flyin'? Where's my three million bucks? Come on, Morgan, we talked about this, okay? - You know what happened. - Well, I thought I did. - And then you disappeared. - I... No, I... No. No, I didn't disappear. No, no, I-- I just, you know, I had to lie low for a while. But I'm not hiding. I wasn't, you know. We're in the phonebook. So, it's, yeah, at least had to go straight, you know for the... for the family, so... I'm-- I'm now doing some consulting work now with John DeLorean. You know, the car guy? So, he's makin' this amazing car. It's a car... It's got wings. A flying car? No, I mean, it doesn't fly, you know it's just that-- - A flying car that doesn't fly. - Yeah. Sound like a sure fire fucking hit to me, Jim! Jim: Yeah, I know it's a littl-- - A flying car? - That doesn't fuckin' fly. - What're you doin', Morgan? - Come on. - What do you think, Katy? Huh? I should just whack this motherfucker? Sure, why not? - Come on, man... - Hey, wait, Morgan. Stop. - Calm down, okay. - Calm down? - Yeah, I'm your friend. - You're my friend? - Yeah! I was at your wedding. - You know what? My ex-wife was at my wedding, Jim. She fucked me over, too! - Okay, that's a bad example. - That is a bad example. I'm gonna bash your fuckin' head in. Jim: Come on, Morgan, stop it. - Stop it? - Yeah. What the fuck are you doin' here, Jim? The FBI! Okay? They came to talk to me. They're askin' questions about you. - FBI? What kind of questions? - Yeah. Like, how we met, how long we know each other-- Morgan: And what did you fuckin' tell them, Jim? I told them the truth, okay? - You told them the truth? - Well, not everything. Obviously, but, come on, Morgan, look, look, look, look, look. I may be many things, okay? But I'm not a snitch. [instrumental music] [indistinct chatter] [grunting] [clears throat] Forgetting something? Oh! You're right, I'm sorry. Hi, how are you? Tape, the fucking tape. The tape, yes, right. Uh, I dumped it. I dumped it. I had to dump it. - You dumped it? - Yeah, the tape, the wire. The whole thing, I-- I-- I got rid of it. - You dumped it where? - In the trash. But, no, no, no. It's fine. It's okay. Don't worry. It's good. It's fine. - It's fine? - Yeah. So he just goes to take out the trash and he finds it. And then it just fucks our whole operation, but it's fine. I got nervous. I'm not Mr. Fuckin' Superspy. - Jesus Christ, Jim. - Okay, okay. But, hey, at least he and I are talking now. That's a good thing. I mean, we discussed, the-- the, uh, money in the Cayman's and how to access it. But we only have your word for it and that's worth shit. Look, from now on, every time you see that fucker you're wearing a wire. Absolutely. Absolutely. Wh-- which I, you know, I could say brings me to my second issue. You gotta be fuckin' kidding me. Hey, look, hey, hold on, okay, look, I realize that you and I, we have never, uh... We never discussed about my, uh, you know, my cut. - Your cut? - Yeah, my cut. My, you know, my percentage. Look, man, Morgan finds out what I'm doing, I'm a dead man. It's only fair that I'm, you know, entitled to a little piece of whatever you recoup from him, right? You know what, just maybe a little tiny piece. You know, something like, um... Well, I don't know what's fair. Ten percent? Ten percent? - Hm. Alright. - A little. Yeah. Just a sliver. - Entitled? - Yeah, yeah. Well, you see it's pretty simple, Jim. We have a way of working these things out. You get ten percent of suck my fucking dick! You're already a paid government informant. - Am I? Barely I would say. I-- - Jim. - What? - Must I remind you? I'm the only thing standing between you and prison. Your job is to hook Morgan Hetrick. Is he hooked? Isn't that why I'm here? 'Cause the last I checked, he was in the Cayman Islands countin' his fuckin' money. I told you it was gonna take... It's gonna take a little time for me to earn back his trust. I think you've been spending so much time partying with John DeLorean, you forgot what you're supposed to be doing here. I need less champagne... - More cocaine. - That's clever, you know. And if you've got some sort of misplaced loyalty to Morgan or you think you're protecting your family by fucking this shit up, you're sadly fuckin' mistaken. The next time you call me, it better be for a good fuckin' reason. Ten fuckin' percent? The FBI will never ever pay you ten percent. You owe us. We don't owe you. Your next check is gonna be short a 126 bucks, because that's how much those wires cost. Hey. I could probably get you a better deal on those, you know? [upbeat music] [children shouting] Hey, that's a groovy little camera you got. - Hello. - Betamax, man. Uh-huh. Any money you're not putting into DeLorean, put it into Betamax. What money? I don't know why she bothers with him. You know, he's chained by a grandmaster. Really? Oh. James Hoffman. What is that German? Yeah, I guess so. You know, Jim, everything is out there. It just takes a bit of leg work. But that's what I do. I gotta say, most people are kinda straight. But every once in a while, you come up against someone who's just 90% bullshit. Wants to hitch a ride. The thing is, I haven't been able to turn up anything about you at all. That worries me. Yeah, that worries me too, actually. Oh. - Hey, Ellen. - Yeah? Roy here thinks I'm 90% bullshit. Ninety? [chuckles] Howard: James D'Jong. Or is it D'Yong? - This is your birth name? - Mm-hmm. Is your wife even aware that you are James D'Jong? I mean, I think so. I-- I... I actually don't know if it's ever come up. And what about Mr. DeLorean, was he aware of your real name? Your checkered history? - I believe he was. - You believe? - You-- you discussed it? James: No, but I alluded to it. One of his executives had me background checked. Background check on a man who has no criminal history, never spent a night in prison, has only filed one somewhat suspect tax return in the last ten years? What background was there to check? James D'jong on the other hand... Well, one can see why you might wanna change your name. Hmm. Oh, don't worry about him. He's just antsy because we're stalled on the money. What're you talkin' about? I thought you guys were signin' 'em up left and right. Not gonna raise 90 million with penny antique car dealerships. GM thinks they've created a monster and it scares them. If Detroit is scared of you, so is corporate America. The fact is, I don't think I've got a chance in hell of raising 90 million. So take it somewhere else. Just like that, right? I'm being serious. Look, John... Roy digs deep enough he's probably gonna find something you're not gonna like. Truth is, I've flown all kinds of shit all over the world. Bangkok, Bolivia... There're all types of people. The one thing I've learned is that there is a deal to be made everywhere, always. Right now we might be livin' in, oh, sad cynical times, but you're the goddamn American dream, man. People around the world love that shit. So I say, you know, they don't love you here... just, uh, take it somewhere they will. Bring the American dream to them. It's an entire Atlantic ocean away from your primary market and it's in the middle of a fucking warzone. Do you know how many people were killed in Northern Ireland last year? Ninety. Do you know how many people were murdered in Detroit? Nine hundred! Do the fucking math. You'd be starting from scratch. The last thing they built was the Titanic. Man on TV: It's John DeLorean's new sports car, the DMC12. Thirty thousand a year, the production target for the Northern Ireland plant, with the first cars to go to dealers this fall. Oh! What's wrong? Is your little buddy in a faraway land and can't come out and play? Mm-hmm. It think it's cute how you always gets sad when he's out of town. Oh, come on. Man on TV: The British government spent $120 million for the plant. For John DeLorean, it's the realization of a dream that started a long time ago. Howard: So for 18 months, while John DeLorean was building his factory providing jobs, helping bring peace to a blighted country you barely heard from. No, you're not understanding what I'm saying, okay? Look, we'll... I will set up the meeting, okay? Jim: Well, I was tryin' to get Morgan Hetrick to part with his money. If we set up a meeting, you probably will. See, she's smart. Look, are you gonna call him or not? Morgan: I'm on it. Alright? The Dayglow Bank. [laughs] Howard: For 18 months, that is a... that is a very long time. Jim: Yeah, well, he had three million reasons not to trust me. Mr. Hoffman, we've heard of your escapades in the drug business. Yet, no jail time. We've heard of your dealings with nefarious criminals, yet still alive to tell the tale. Mr. Hoffman, it must be said you live a charmed life. Not sure my wife would agree with you. We never seem to really get ahead of ourselves, you know? - Mm-hmm. - Well, you'll get there. Now, just look at John, one minute he's tryin' to sweet talk car dealers. The next, he's got this office on Park Avenue. - Park Avenue. - Oh, my God, yes. You should see it. Marble everywhere. Marble. Fuck them and fuck their marble. What... What're you talkin' about? Who? Who? Who? - What's wrong? - John and Cristina. It's marble this and marble that. - Why don't we have any marble? - Hey! Hey! Hey! What are you doing? Come here. Here, look at me. Hey, marble's only good for two things, okay? Gravestones and marbles. You do know marbles aren't made of marble, they're made of glass. I don't know that. I had no idea. I-- I didn't... I didn't know that. What would I do without you? I would run around sounding like a dipshit. Hey, look, baby. You know, you got to realize something. In the America that I grew up in a man was defined by the work that he did. But it never stopped me from dreaming, okay? When I was nine months old, my daddy bought me a beat up, old Chevrolet. He broke it down to 42,000 pieces and I put it together with my hands and my tool. My tool! What? What? What? [instrumental music] John: I know it's incredibly complicated, but you just have to trust me. Molly: I do trust you, but then... you can't move money around like that. John: Why not? It's my money. Molly: No, it's not. Molly: Christ, John. If someone finds out-- John: Well, that's why we're switching... Jim. Ellen: Jim! What? Ellen: Hurry! Hurry! Quick. - Jim, come here. Look. - What's goin' on? I think it's clear what's going on. Jim: Oh, come on. They work together. Ellen: Something's going on. He's just trying to calm her down. I-- I don't know what the big deal is. Oh, my God, you think you're so good with people, but you don't even see when it's right in front of your face. What the hell is that supposed to mean? H-- He's so full of shit. - He cheats at chess. - How do you know? - You don't play chess. - And now this thing with Molly. Oh, come on, that's bullshit. John is as straight as an arrow, he is. You think that, but look at his chin. That's where the bullshit starts. Okay, I'm sorry, his chin? Wh-- what about his chin? Haven't you ever looked at those old pictures hanging in their house? He has no chin. Now he has a chin. Think about it. - Really? - Think about... - Hey, uh, I better go, okay? - What is that? What time are you pickin' up the kids from school? - Baby! Baby! - It's a button. What is that? No, no, no, no! This... [gasps] - What the fuck? - It's just a gadget that... - Oh, shit! Okay-- - What is going on? Jim: Let me explain, okay? I-- I-- I'll explain. - What's going on? - It's not a big deal, hon. Okay, here, look, look, look. Let's just sit down and I'll explain everything. No, no, no, no, no, you sit down and you tell me what the fuck? - Here, it's no big deal-- - Sit! Okay, okay, okay. Okay, look, I... Okay, no better way to say it than just to say it, right? You know, I can beat around the bush or sugar coat, I'm gonna-- I'm about to lose my shit right now. Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay! Look, I, um... I... I work for the FBI. - You're in the FBI? - Yes. I mean, no. No, I-- I-- I'm not in the FBI. I-- I work for the FBI. You know, u-- undercover, like a spy. - You're a spy? - Exactly, yeah. Or no! No, I'm not a spy. I'm... They would classify me as an informant. But I am part of, you know, President Reagan's War on Drugs, so I just never told you about it, because I didn't want you to worry. I don't understand. Well, that's because it's a lot to take in. No, no, no. I understand what you're saying. But I-- I don't understand what you're fucking saying. You're in the airplane business. Well, no, not anymore, but that's how this all got started. How long has this been going on? Ah, six months. Six months, that's it. I mean, three years total, I guess. Three years? Mm-hmm, yeah, that's all. - Three years. - Mm-hmm. - Three fucking years? - Oh, no, no, baby, baby. - Three fucking years? - Hey, listen to me. - You-- - Listen to me. We moved here to start over. You promised! - Hon, we did start over, okay? - You promised! - I know, we did. - You promised me! Look, it's all incredibly complicated. Remember the guy that I told you about Morgan, Morgan Hetrick? He's the one that organized our whole Bolivia trip. - He set you up. - Yeah, exactly. He set me up, okay? Baby, look, I... They caught me with a plane load of cocaine, alright? They were never gonna just let me walk away, alright? I have to give them Morgan, otherwise they will send me to prison for a very, very long time. Okay, and I know that it must be very upsetting to you to think about it, but-- but it is situation that we are in. - We? - Yeah, we. Why we? What's we? Because you were on the plane too. They've been threatening me with all sorts of stuff. You wouldn't even believe it lately. What they would do with you or where they'd send our kids. - It's overwhelming. - Oh, my God. I mean, I feel so good, I've been living with this burden for so long, it feels so good to finally share it... - No. Nothing to worry about. - Oh, my God! Honey, I'm not happy about it either, hon. Look, you really think I wanna take the government payin' our fuckin' rent. They pay our rent? - Yeah, they pay for everything. - They pay our rent? Yeah, but not enough in my opinion, but that's a whole separate issue. I could really use your help strategizing about it, you know. Hey, honey, look, look, look, look! Once I-- I get through with this, then we're home free, alright. I am doing this for us! Hell, I'm doing this for America! You are delusional! What the... We have children. - What if this-- this-- this... - What? Who? Morgan? - Morgan, what if he finds out? - He won't. He won't. He's not gonna. Hon, look, I've actually found something that I'm kinda good at. Fuck you! Okay, stop. Ellen, stop! Okay, where-- where are you goin'? I'm gonna go and get the kids and take 'em to my mom. No, please, don't. Okay, what do you want me to do? I'll do anything. What do you want? - What do I want you to do? - Yeah. I want you to just stop. Can you please, please just stop fucking up my life? Please. Every time, every time like a little piece of sunshine starts to shine, you just come and you stomp on it. What if this guy comes and kills us? [instrumental music] [Ellen sobbing] Man on radio: The DeLorean is the most awaited sports car in automotive history. Drive the DeLorean and live the dream. [screaming] Hey, is this him? That guy with the flying car? Yeah, that's him. Yeah. Looks like your buddy's flying car's really taken off. Yeah, you can say that again. Hey, you should meet him. - Meet John DeLorean? - Yeah, sure. Why not? In-- in fact, you know they're having a party this Saturday. You guys should go. Yeah? I gotta make a call. I'll be right back. Do you think he would mind? Morgan. Morgan. Morgan. Can we party with John DeLorean? Sure, we can. [upbeat music] ¶ Get down on it ¶ ¶ Get down on it ¶ ¶ Get down on it ¶ ¶ Get down on it ¶ ¶ How you gonna do it if you really don't wanna dance ¶ ¶ By standing on the wall? ¶ ¶ Get your back up off the wall ¶ ¶ Tell me ¶ ¶ How you gonna do it if you really don't wanna dance ¶ ¶ By standing on the wall? ¶ ¶ Get your back up off the wall ¶ ¶ 'Cause I heard all the people sayin' ¶ ¶ Get down on it ¶ ¶ Come on and ¶ ¶ Get down on it ¶ ¶ If you really want it ¶ ¶ Get down on it ¶ ¶ You gotta feel it ¶ ¶ Get down on it ¶ ¶ Get down on it ¶ ¶ Get down on it ¶ ¶ Come on and ¶ ¶ Get down on it ¶ ¶ Baby baby ¶ ¶ Get down on it ¶ ¶ Get on it ¶ ¶ Get down on it ¶ ¶ I say people ¶ ¶ What? ¶ ¶ What you gonna do? ¶ ¶ You've gotta get on the groove ¶ ¶ If you want your body to move ¶ ¶ Tell me baby ¶¶ Cut the music.

Johnny on phone: DeLorean, you sold me a piece of shit. [all laughing] Good joke, Johnny. How's it taking those corners? Johnny: God dammit, I'm serious! It broke down five minutes from the showroom. Johnny, you've got one of our first models and there's bound to be teething problem, so we'll send a new car out to you first thing in the morning. Johnny: You already did that and it broke down again, you fucking fraud! What the fuck! [laughs] Hey, that's why I used the number one talk show host in America, right? Alright, let's kick it! ¶ Dancin' dancin' dancin' ¶ ¶ She's a dancin' machine ¶ ¶ Oh babe move it baby ¶ ¶ Mmm bop doo wop ¶ ¶ Automatic systematic ¶ ¶ Full of color self contained tuned and gentle... ¶ Never take a call from that cocksucker Carson again. And never ever fucking ever put him on speaker phone unless you know exactly what he's going to say. You made me look like a fucking idiot! ¶ She's movin' she's groovin'... ¶¶ Roy: You've been flapping your mouth and you don't know what you're talking about. I know more about this than the lot of you put together. I would keep my mouth shut if I were you. - What, you now threatening? - Hey, hey, hey! - Get your hands off... - Hey, hey, hey! Everything okay here? Everything's fine. - You okay? - Yeah. - You sure? - Yeah. Mind your own business. There you are. I hear you're expecting someone. Oh, yeah, I hope it's okay, I invited a couple of friends, you know, I... People I wanted to... [chuckles] Uh... [giggles] - Hi. - Hi. - Nice to see you. - You as well. You know, it's important for us that our friends, um, share in our success and we wanted to give you something as a, uh, a token of our friendship. [cackles] I will be getting this in the divorce, anyway. [all laugh] ¶ Funtime ¶ ¶ Strolling in the sunshine... ¶¶ So, why did you come back? - The sex. - Oh! And I knew what I was getting into when I married you. You're not a bad man. You're just an idiot. [laughs] Oh, hell yeah. [chuckles] Whatever you have to do just do it, but finish it. Okay. Hey, Morgan! Hi! I-- I didn't think you guys were gonna make it. - Helen. Finally. - Ellen. We have heard so much about you. All lies I'm sure. I have a migraine, so I'm gonna go drive home and, um, I'll see you later. Did the FBI suggest you invite Mr. Hetrick to the party? No, that would've been my idea. Okay, why? Wha... He-- he wasn't an acquaintance of Mr. DeLorean. No, sir, not of John. Come on, uh, let me introduce you. Hey, John. John. I-- I-- I just wanna introduce you to a good friend of mine. This is Morgan Hetrick and Katy. Well, welcome, welcome. John, I'm hearing great things about your car. What then was the purpose of inviting a man who is the subject of a major FBI investigation to a social event w-- with your friend John DeLorean? Ah, well, I suppose in retrospect I was showing off for Morgan. At that point, you know, John was a pretty big deal. Let me get you some drinks. Come on. Cristina. Why did you bring that man here? - Who, Morgan? - Yeah. - Well, I... - Yeah, Morgan Hetrick. He's, he's a drug dealer. What? He is? - A-- are you sure? - Yeah, yeah. I know him from a long time ago. You wanted him to think that you moved with the movers and the shakers. - Sure. - And how'd they get on? Was this the beginning of the alleged plot? No, no, but, um, Mr. Hetrick certainly made an impression. [laughing] Are you fucking kidding me? This is the bedroom! Get out of here! - They're like Ken and Barbie! - Oh, you gotta be kidding me? - Hey, put those back right now! - Oh... She's just so delicious and elegant. We're gonna get out of this room. Get out. Come on. Let's go, guys. It's important. Okay? It's a... Can you put the dresses back, please? Okay? Can you put 'em back? Beautiful singing voice, alright? Oh, I would fuck her for sure. Oh, I know you would, baby. Come on, let's get out of here, please? - Jim, Jim! - Alright? Please? He said to make ourselves at home! - This is not what he meant... - No, he didn't. - But come here. - What? What're you doing? - Okay? I... - It's worth a blowie. Oh, my God! No, no, no, no, no. Clean this up. - Don't do this in here. - Oh, this ain't for me, Jim. - What're you talking about? - This is for you. Jim: No, I'm... What? No, no, no, no. I'm good, okay? I'm not gonna... What the fuck are you doing now? She has so many clothes. I just, I wanna see if she even notices. Yeah, she's gonna notice. Okay? Please, don't put that dress on. Morgan: Jim, I insist. If we are gonna work together, we gotta be able to play together. I'm not gonna do it, okay? - Jim? - I'm not gonna do it. Do it, Jim! Morgan: Do it! Katy: Do it! - Do it! Do it! - Okay. Okay. Okay, fine. God, this isn't funny. I'll do... I'm gonna do a, just a, a half a line here. [sniffs] - Okay? - Yes! Good? Good. Okay? Can we go now, please? Everybody? Let's go. [Morgan laughs] Oh, my God. Wh-- wh-- what is going on right now? What was that? What is going on? - Jim... - Oh, boy. What? We'd like to cut in little angel dust. - Oh, my God. Morgan: Dad's a little bad. Okay, I've noticed. I really-- - You okay, Jim? - That's not, that's not funny. I'm gonna be fine, but I need you to... Katy! Hey! Hey! ¶ Boogie no more ¶ ¶ Listen to the music ¶ Hey, what you're doing? - Ha-ha-ha! - Come on, now! [music continues] ¶ There's no time to waste ¶ ¶ Let's get this show on the road ¶ Mm! Mm! [gasps] Don't touch me! Yummy! Shit. Katy! [squealing] What the hell were you thinking... I know, I know, I just... [indistinct chatter] ¶ Listen to the music and... ¶ [moaning] She's wearing my dress! I've got it under control, okay? It's fine. Don't worry... Oh! [cheering] [laughing] Whoo! - Hey, lady? - Ah! Oh, my... Now it's party! [screaming] Hey! Come here. Come here. Come here. Come here. Give me your hand. Get out of the pool. Hey! Don't do that! Morgan! Morgan! - Stop it. Jim: Morgan! Are you fucking kidding? Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck! Hey. Hey. Hey. [screaming] [laughing] Goddamn it! [laughing] - I got you! - I love you, baby! ¶ Boogie oogie oogie ¶ ¶ Get down ¶ ¶ Boogie oogie oogie ¶ ¶ Get down ¶ ¶ Boogie oogie oogie ¶¶ John and Cristina are pissed. Whole night was a fucking nightmare! The only good thing about it is that you're back home. Oh, there's one other good thing. [laughing] Oh, that's right. Wait... But where's the key? What the hell's this? It's a coupon for 25 percent off a brand new DeLorean at our nearest dealer. - What the fuck? - What did you think? He was gonna give you a brand new car? Yes! Yeah! I mean, come on. The guy's got thousands of 'em. What... it's a lot better than this shit. Mr. Hoffman, did you expect to benefit financially from your association with John DeLorean? Uh, no, sir. You didn't repeatedly hint that a free DeLorean car might be in order? - No, sir. - Why not? You being such a important consultant. Uh, well, to tell you the truth, it wasn't a very good car. [indistinct chatter] Flattered to deceive. Jim: Uh, by the time it came to market everything original about it had been striped away. I mean, he just couldn't make the car he wanted to with the, with the money he had. I-- I-- I actually felt sorry for him at that point 'cause there he was schlepping himself around the world attempting to sell this, this dream he didn't even believe in any more. Well, that's quite an insight for a man with no experience. Well, I know cars. You know, John knows cars. Obviously, he... Boils down to the fact that the car wasn't good enough. - You know, just ask him. - Okay. - Mr. Hoffman, I don't think-- - Well, ask him. Eh, the car wasn't good enough, was it, John? Am I right? Uh, I mean, that's the problem here. - Not all this other shit. - Mr. Hoffman! [gavel thumping] Settle! Settle down. Mr. Hoffman, the car is not on trial here, and neither are you. I know. I know. Sorry. Judge Takasugi: Mr. Weitzman. - Y-- y-- yes, Your Honor. But we are getting to the crux of the matter. Mr. Hoffman, if cars are clearly your thing and the DeLorean was, in your eyes, such a disappointment, is this perhaps reason enough to betray your friend and neighbor? [phone ringing] [ringing continues] Oh, John, just this once. Alright, it's okay. Yeah. Fuck! John? Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! No. Don't you say anything. If it comes from anyone, it comes from me. That bitch! That fucking bitch! You were right. What about Belfast? Alright. Do that. Molly's gone to the fucking papers. - Fuck! - Why would she? [John sighs] I got to go to Belfast. - Now? - Mm-hm. I'll get your case. [phone ringing] Yep. Bill... No, I'm not gonna talk to every fucking... Yeah, I'll take the "Times." Patch 'em through. Molly. I told you. Hey, John, anything I can do? No. No. - Should we go? - No. - Just finish the caviar. Yeah? - Yeah. Yes, Jeff, I absolutely refute these allegations. No company in the world has been subjected to more scrutiny from you gentlemen in the press, from auditors, from accountants. [indistinct chatter] John: Look, Jeff, off the record... Okay. On the record, she's nothing more than a glorified secretary, and she wasn't even up to that job. Can we go, please? John: There are no such thing as secret Swiss bank accounts. Molly Gibson had absolutely no access to detailed financial records. That is it. She had access to everything. Fucking everything! Fuck! Mr. Hoffman, you are aware that these allegations of financial impropriety were fully investigated by the British government and dismissed. Dismissed. Absolutely. Ladies and gentlemen, the truth is that while John DeLorean was in the eye of the hurricane, so to speak, Mr. Hoffman's sole contribution was that of a glorified groundskeeper. Jim: That is not true. I cleaned his pool as well. [people laughing] John: Doin' a good job down there. [Jim laughs] Hey. What's up, John? I didn't know you were back. Got in last night. You want a beer? Sure. There was a moment there when it was absolutely perfect. [John sighs] I don't have the cash to make payroll. Renault is going to stop supplying our engines. Of the 8000 cars we've built, I've sold maybe 3000. I owe Bank of America $20 million, and they own every car on this side of the Atlantic. All of their loans are being called in. That facility is cancelled. Well, I mean, you know, things could get worse. [both laugh] It's over, buddy. Wait a minute. That's not... No. Uh-uh. No. No, no, no. I-- I-- I don't believe that. Not for a second. Eh, look... You're-- you're gonna think of something. You'll work it out. You always do, you know. You know what? This is a lot like that-- that... The car that your dad bought you. No, it is. Y-- y-- you got the whole thing laid out in front of you in a million pieces, and-- and what did you do in that situation? You put that thing back together. You know, better than new. Because that's... I mean, that's who you are. I appreciate your optimism, Jim. But it's no good. No, no, no. Th-- th-- this is not optimism. That's not what's goin' on here. This is fact. You are a remarkable guy. You're a force of nature. [chuckling] You are. Me, I'm full of shit. Alright? But I know I'm full of shit. So there's charm in that. You know? I think. I hope. Right? But, no, really. You, you actually get stuff done. Why don't you help me? Absolutely. Whatever you need. I need to raise $30 million in the next ten days. And there's no bank, no hedge fund, no investor who's going to lend it to me. But you know people. [Jim chuckles softly] I... [chuckles] Now I have a good business. I can make people very wealthy. It's a cash flow problem. Alright? I need to raise $30 million. And you know people. Bolivia. Thailand. All the rest of it. You know people. [chuckles softly] What are we talking about here, John? [exhales] That I need your help. I need this, Jim. There are 2000 workers in Belfast that need this. You know, the joke is, I could walk away now and still be a very rich man. But I can't do that. I'm not that guy. Can you help me, Jim? [intense music] [engine cranking] [brakes screeching] [exhales] [indistinct chatter] [upbeat music] - You're early. - Um-hm. DeLorean wants me to set him up with $30 million worth of cocaine. What? John DeLorean... $30 million. Cocaine. If I put him and Hetrick together, that'd be a pretty sweet deal for you, yeah? Wait, wait, wait. John DeLorean? Why on earth would John DeLorean-- Who gives a shit? Hey, you want a big name for President Reagan? You wanna stop drowning? I can give you John DeLorean on a silver fucking platter. And I'll do it. All I ask is that, my family and I go free, my record is expunged... and I get ten percent of whatever Morgan transfers to Davrow. What's wrong, Special Agent? This kind of decision outside your pay grade? I got to make a call. [intense music] [exhales] Jim: Look, we never thought this whole thing was gonna happen. John was looking for the funds legally but, uh, you know, this whole drug thing was a weird fantasy. Right. But, you know, then, once the FBI got involved, they got very excited about it. And that's when we decided to bring Davrow in. Ah. Davrow. Yeah, let's talk about Davrow. Jim: There's nothin' to understand. It's a road trip. Okay? The guy is under a lot of pressure. We're all under a lot of pressure. Yeah, no, I know. Okay. But his has a few more decimal points. Okay? I'm just introducing him to a banker right now. Bill: Budget Rental Car's talking about taking a thousand cars. They figure there are a lot of people who don't necessarily want to own a DeLorean, but they would love to experience driving one. John. - John. - I just can't keep doing this. They walk us up the aisle and fuck us before we take our vows. Alright, I got this other meeting to go to. - Are we set? - All set. - What other meeting? - You're doin' a great job. - Keep it up. Bill: Why with him? Why would you go to a meeting with him? [dramatic music] Hey, hey, hey. You built it. You drive it. [engine cranking] [engine revving] [music continues] [engine revving] Bill: ...specialize in building money in high risk, high yield investments. John: That just won't work, Bill. [engine revving] [tires screeching] [John chuckling] What? When I get this money I'm going right back to... [inhales] going right back to that sketch. [chuckles softly] I want that feeling back. And how it felt when you're driving down the street in the car you built yourself. And you know your dad's watching you and you just... swell up. [mellow music] [engine revving] You know, John, it's not too late to back out of this thing, right? Because these guys, I mean... they, um, they're not good people. And once they get their hooks in you, it can really-- There are an awful lot of families in Northern Ireland, who need this. Men and women not afraid to stand up and be counted. And if they can do it... goddamn right, I can as well. [music continues] Nice to meet you. James Benedict. Um-hm. Hi. [chuckles softly] I can't believe I'm here with John DeLorean. I saw you on TV. - Well, I'm on TV a lot. - I... - Coffee? - Black. Benedict: I'm not sure that, uh, TV is good for business. I don't exactly relish the spotlight. Well, the way I see it, the darkest dark is the dark besides the spotlight. You can do anything there and no one seems to notice. Benedict: I like that. The darkest dark... So, uh, John, I, uh, I like what I see of the, uh... It's funny, they call it the DeLorean in front of John DeLorean. But, uh, yeah. Great things. Um, I love the wings. They're futuristic. Maybe I'll get a car out of this. [knock on door] [door opens] John. [chuckling] I guess fate has dealt you a dirty blow. - Well, I'm still swinging. - Good for you. [John chuckles] - James Benedict. - Morgan... Hetrick. - Uh, coffee? - Nope. So, John. What's the story? The story is, the British government has written off two hundred twenty eight million dollars of our debt. But they won't pay us the 94 they still owe us. And that is exactly why I stay away from anything to do with governments. [all laughing] Morgan, I think we can all agree that this could be the start of a very good relationship. Mutually beneficial. Shall we? Jim. You're the point man on this. Do you wanna... Okay, well, we all know that John is one of the finest businessmen in-- in-- in, on this planet. Umm-- Don't need a fucking biography, Jim. What's the deal? Uh, you know, I'm not really sure where to start. Um... The deal is, my company's worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Anyone who's looked at our books agrees on that. But I've hit a cash flow problem and I need to plug the gap. I have two million, I need to turn it into thirty million within eight days, or we lose control. - Jim? - Yeah. So, uh, we need you to go down to Columbia and pick up the merchandise. I don't sell. I don't distribute. It's not my game. Yeah, we're not asking you to do that. We have someone for that. Who? - I don't like-- - His name is John Vicenza. This is what he does. He put a lot of money through this bank. A lot of money. So everything goes smooth, everybody gets their cut, John gets to keep his company, and, uh, we get an option to invest, to diversify. Because if you do too much here, it raises flags. Yeah, absolutely, nature of our business, we move money all over the world without explaining it. Okay. Got to admit. You make me nervous. [Morgan puffing] Jim. Jim. Jim. We have history. What kind of history? The wrong kind. Morgan: Look, I don't want any kind of thing structured where Jim here has a chance to fuck around. - Okay? - Oh, boy. I mean, what if Jim takes the monkeys. Jim says I'm going to my dealer. Jim comes back with some bruises. Jim says someone stole the monkeys. Benedict: That's not gonna happen, Morgan. First, Jim's money is tied up with me. He knows if he does anything funny, the money disappears. And second, Vicenza. Jim's head would be on a platter. And his wife's. And kids. So, there's no worries on that front. You trust him? [intense music] As much as any man here. [chuckles] [laughing] John: Alright, now, if the Brits make a move and, um, and the cash isn't in the bank, maybe I need some sort of promissory note I can present to them. Would that be doable? There's a lot of factors involved, but, uh... Yeah, we can look at that all things being even. Morgan? I guess we got a deal. [dramatic music] Well, that went pretty well. Morgan's a good pilot. And he's careful. And a contact for the monkeys. - Stop saying monkeys. - Morgan, he's-- Yeah, Morgan says it because he's a piece of shit criminal. Alright? He's allowed to say monkeys. You're not allowed to say monkeys. Stop saying it. You sound like a fucking idiot. [phone ringing] - Hoffman residence. - Hey. I'm not ready to go. But I ain't goin' nowhere without John's two million. - Any word? - Uh, no, but, um, let me... I-- I'll call you right back, okay? Hey, these guys do not hang around. Alright? You just get that fuckin' money. [phone ringing] [sighs] - Morgan, what? - Yeah, I don't think so. Hey, uh, don't worry. Everything's under control. Okay? I-- I just, um... Look, John says he has the money. Yeah, well, I say I have a nine-inch cock. It doesn't make it true. We need to show he's an active participant, not just a groupie. I understand, okay? You got to trust me here, okay? I... Hello? He... Shit! Shit! [phone ringing] - Hello. - John. Hey. Wh... Oklahoma? What the hell's in Oklahoma? Well, nothing, as it turns out. Has Morgan, um... Well, you know, I just got off the phone with him. Okay? So, he's ready to go. He's not going anywhere until you provide the finance. John on phone: Uh, it's coming. I have to be careful. Hey. You're the one with the, uh, the deadline, man. I know that. I... I will have the money. Okay. Alright. W... I just want you to understand. I mean, it's got to be tomorrow or-- or-- or the whole thing is off. Yeah. Tomorrow. Absolutely. Okay. Hey, John... John, just, you know, level with me here, okay? If you don't have the money, just tell me now. No, I have the money. Okay. Okay. [phone ringing] Oh, boy. - Hello. - I don't have the money. Goddammit, John! I thought I had the money. I don't have the money. Okay, well, what the hell am I supposed to do with that? Well, cash flow has always been the problem. No, no, no! No, John. No, you're fucking bullshit has always been the problem. Damn it. [phone ringing] - Now what? Benedict on phone: You tell me. [breathing heavily] John doesn't have the money. Yeah, I know he doesn't have the money. What do you think? I've been listening to the Bee Gees all day? So, fuck him, and fuck you! Wait, no, no, no. Hold on. H-- hold on a second. Okay? I'm... Look, I'm... Uh... We're not done yet. Okay? Benedict: How the fuck did you work that out? You... You-- you have to lend him the money. What? Well, Davrow has to lend him the money. Okay? It's an investment. Hoffman, let me get this straight... You want the FBI to lend John DeLorean two million dollars so that he can buy the cocaine that we're going to arrest him with? Yeah, that's right. You outta your fuckin' mind? No... [groans] God! Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. No, uh, Ellen, it's not what it... Morgan Hetrick, I get. John is your friend. No, no, no. He is not our friend. Okay? The guy waltz into our life completely uninvited. Uh-- uh, look, I like him, okay? And, yes, he's done some great things, but at the end of the day, he is as full of shit as the rest of us. - Don't you drag him down-- - Drag him? No, he came to me, Ellen. He wanted me to set up a drug deal... cocaine! Okay? He wants to deal in cocaine. I mean, how fucked up you have to be to think you can save your company with a coke deal. Huh? He's no better than Morgan. You know... You know what? Actually, he's worse. He is. He sells this dream to people, and it's all bullshit. Okay, look, if he goes through with this then you and me, the kids, we're home free. Okay? We get millions. Jim, what are you talking about? - Oh-- Ellen: Jim-- I have a deal. I have deal cut. Alright. Ten percent of whatever the FBI recovers. Okay? We're talking millions. You can have all the fucking marbles that you want. You can, yeah. And it is what you deserve. Honestly, it is. After all the bullshit that I put your through, all the-- all the, all the promises... - This is another promise. - No! No! Not... Oh, baby, no. Not this time. Okay, look. Listen to me... You have to trust me. Okay? Just trust me one last time, please. [mellow music] [inhales] [exhales] [music continues] [engine revving] Hey. Hey, where's Morgan? Oh, he's not here tonight. He's got a hot date. Hey, psst. Join the party. Go on. Thanks. Drink up. [instrumental music] [door creaking] Jim: I remember the first time we came here. And I remember lookin' at you and... thinkin' there was something different about you. I couldn't put my finger on it, but... But Ellen... Ellen was... She, um... You know, she spotted it right away. [snaps finger] You know what it is? It's your chin. [chuckles] You alright? See, 'cause in your... The old photos of you... you don't have much of a chin. Now you have a chin. See what I'm saying? It's no secret, I had a procedure. You're chinless. Alright, Jim. You're a fake. Because I had a procedure? Half of California has plastic surgery. No, no, no. Not because of that. Because you are inherently chinless. I don't trust someone who doesn't have a chin. Now, Jim, I've done everything I could to raise this money, but unfortunately, with the scrutiny I'm under, I've been unable to-- No, no, no. I don't think you had any intention. I think you're just stringing us along 'cause you're a fuckin' chinless fake. - Cut the shit! - Hmm? I was worried you would fuck it up. - Me? - Morgan thinks you're a snake. Morgan. Oh, yeah... What, you talked to Morgan? I talk to everyone, that's what I do. - Okay. - You fucked him over. Oh, okay. That's what he told you, huh? You guys have little chit-chats and everything now? That's good. Well, did he... Did he tell you about him and Cristina? - Did that come up? - Excuse me? Oh... Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. See. No, she... Well, Morgan used to work for this millionaire that, that Cristina used to, uh, see, like, date, or, uh... Or how do you put it? [groans] What the fuck are you saying about my wife? [phone ringing] I, nothing... Nothing. I... [ringing continues] John: Hello? - Uh... [sighs] Well, I can't thank you enough. John, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that. I... Well... It's probably for the best this whole thing's falling apart. That was James Benedict at Davrow. He's gonna loan me two million dollars. [dramatic music] Morgan just took off. [crickets chirping] Man on TV: With his firm, and all the remaining jobs that depend on it on the brink of extinction, DeLorean, a former General Motors executive vowed to fight on. John on TV: The company's going to survive as long as I have a breath left in me. [phone ringing] Man on TV: Up until now, the bank rolled DeLorean's plant here at Belfast... Hoffman residence. Yeah. Morgan. Okay. Yeah. No, sounds good. I'm on my way. Alright. Man on TV: ...whether they'll continue to bail out the firm that bears John DeLorean's name. Let it sink. [music continues] Morgan: You look nervous. Jim: Yeah, 'cause I am fucking nervous. Where's the stuff? I told you, it's in the car with Katy. Yeah, well, I hope, there's some left. You better hurry. Hey. Hey, gorgeous. [clears throat] Hey, lifesaver. - Hey. - Let's show him. Uh-hmm. - Holy moly! - Mm-hm. [Morgan chuckling] [engine sputtering] Holy moly! [tires screeching] [engines revving] [tires screeching] Morgan Hetrick, Katy Connors, you're under arrest. Morgan: Motherfucking mother fucker! - Step away from the car. - Morgan... How'd he... How does he... How does he know me? You fucker! - I'm going to fuckin' kill you! Katy: Get the fuck away from me! You're fuckin' dead, Hoffman! You're dead! [laughing] Oh, yeah! Fucked me twice... Fucked me twice... Ow! Okay, fuckhead! Yeah. You too. You'll pay, assholes! - Don't say a word, baby! - Don't push me. I'm going. Morgan: Don't say a fuckin' word! I thought you were my fuckin' friend. You're dead, Hoffman! [Morgan laughing] Oh, you, motherfuck! Watch the fuckin' hat! [car door closes] One down, one to go. Hey, Jim. You did good. [instrumental music] [birds chirping] [engine revving] [music continues] [sighs] [engine revving] [dramatic music] Hey, everybody, work quickly but cleanly. Okay, he's gonna be sitting there. I want to be able to see the expressions on his face I want to be able to see his hands on the coke. Suspect's in red vehicle heading north towards highway five. [engine revving] [dramatic music] What are you up to, John? You didn't actually rebuild that car on your father's lawn, did you? No. If I so much as stepped on daddy's lawn he'd have beaten six shades of shit out of me. Too bad. I like that story. My father was a born again alcoholic. He made everyone's life a misery. You want me to tell them that? History is written by the victors. I will be remembered. My car will be remembered. Our skuzzy coke deal will not. Ping-pong. [John chuckles] Ping-pong. [knocking on door] Ellen! [panting] Cristina: I know you're in there. Open the door! We have to talk. [instrumental music] [engine revving] Come on! [drill whirring] [music continues] Dammit! Now, what? Great. - John. - What the fuck's he doing here? Where are you going, John? Open the window, Jim. Open the window, Jim. Jim! - What do you want me to do? - Do what you have to do. Come on, Jim. You fuckin' piece of shit. Hey, what the... Get your hands off me. - You're coming with us. - I know my rights. [indistinct chatter] Benedict: Well, just make sure you've got him head to toe in there. Lift the glass up, please. [indistinct chatter] I've got the champagne. Has this been bugged yet? So, what are you gonna do if something goes wrong? It won't. John always has a plan. I've been down this road before and I love Jim, I'm never gonna leave him but if John is just your golden ticket then you need to have a plan 'cause you will be dragged down with him. [phone ringing] - Jim? - Ellen, it's Bill. I'm looking for John, do you have any idea where he is or Cristina or-- - Has something happened? - No. What do you mean? - What could've happened? - No, nothing. Sorry, Bill. - No, I don't know where-- - Oh, let me talk to him. Give me the phone! Bill. Cristina, it's absolutely vital that I speak to John immediately, we know he's in LA but we can't find him. You know where he is? [dramatic music] [indistinct chatter] Thank you. Well, you're moments away from being a very rich man. Howard: Okay, let me rephrase the question. Who first raised the subject of a possible drug deal? It's hard to say. It just kind of came up. H-- how did it just "come up?" Well, one minute it wasn't there and the next minute, it was. - Hurry up, come on. - They're in the lobby. Heading upstairs. Let's get everything ready. Okay. Got it. Agent 1: Hide that, hide that. Go. [intense music] Mr. DeLorean, excuse me, sir. Is it, Mr. DeLorean? I have a call for you, sir. I'll transfer the call to the house phone, right over there. So did he-- he just call you and-- and-- and say, "Hey, man, I need $30 million to save my company, let's do a drug deal?" Jim: What are we talking about here, John? That I need help. It's just not cut and dry like you want. I-- I-- it really isn't. That's v-- very different than suggesting a-- a-- drug deal, don't you think? Well, it is and it isn't. He may have alluded to it. You don't think that Thomas Edison... or Ford or Kennedy didn't cut a few corners every now and then for the greater good? Is any of this alluding to be found in the many hours of FBI tapes of your phone calls with Mr. DeLorean? Uh, no. This predates that. John DeLorean. John, we have a deal to save the car, the factory... - Everything. - Bill. Bill: Minit Financial came through with a 100 million but you need to sign it now, today, before the Brits get wind of it or there'll be no company left to save. - I have a deal here. Bill: No, you don't. You have a life sentence. You need to sign this. [instrumental music] - I can't do it, Bill. - Why, for Christ sake? This is what we've been breakin' our asses for. Because they'll own the company. At best, I'll be a figure head and most likely they'll push me out. Bill: You can't just throw it all away like this! So, basically, what it all comes down to is your word against his. The word of a man who even according to you is one of the most respected businessmen in the world. And that of a drug smuggler and government informant. [dramatic music] Okay, we've got about 30 seconds. [indistinct chatter] Benedict: Come on. You know the biggest mistake we made? [exhales] Making all the cars the same color. Sure, they're futuristic looking but... should've had a variety. Once we secure the company, we're going to come out with a whole range of colors and it's going to be amazing. Are you okay, John? [sighs] Sure. You know, I never thanked you properly, Jim, and I always meant to. W... Hey... [intense music] Don't do this, John. Just go home to Cristina. Work somethin' else out. I'll go in here alone and just call the whole thing off, alright? No, you're missing the point. John DeLorean always leads from the front. That's why he's John DeLorean. Right? Everything's gonna be fine. [knocking on door] John, glad you could make it. - This is John Vicenza. - Hello. Alright. - Heard a lot about you, John. Vicenza: Hi. Vicenza: Kind of a different world for you, huh? Well, you'd be surprised. I, uh, took the opportunity of ordering some champagne. Well, [chuckles] it, it seems like a day for champagne, huh? Benedict: Now... [DeLorean chuckles] Um, are the, uh, are the, uh, monkeys here? [chuckles] Some. Uh, the rest are downstairs. John: Mm-hm. [dramatic music] Oh! [laughing] We got a quite a party here. It's, uh... Go ahead, John. Pick it up. [dramatic music] Well, that's better than gold. Gold weighs more than that, for goodness sakes. [both laughing] So, here's to, uh, to a lot of success for everyone and, uh, for all those, those phone calls. Huh? Jim? Thank you. [mellow music] Hi, John. Jerry West. I'm with the FBI. You're under arrest for narcotic laws violation. [music continues] I, um, I don't understand. I'm going to advise you of your rights. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney. If you can't afford one, one will be provided. Do you understand your rights? [intense music] John Z. DeLorean, former top executive with General Motors more recently the creator of a slick sports car that bore his name, today faced federal drug charges in Los Angeles. John DeLorean, the flamboyant former GM executive remains in custody tonight on federal drug charges. Man on TV: They found several pounds of cocaine. Don Oliver on TV: The FBI would rather call it an undercover investigation but it was a semi-classic sting operation. The FBI agent said DeLorean had been under surveillance for five months. Man on TV: $24 million cocaine deal. The FBI says, he was the... [indistinct chatter on TV] Man on TV: DeLorean claims Jim trapped him in the drug deal, while FBI agents posing as drug dealers open a suitcase full of cocaine. They could receive federal prison terms of up to 15 years. Driven and finally desperate for success. Woman on TV: DeLorean himself is out of jail on bail in California. We have more on that from Dennis Murphy. Dennis on TV: Last night wearing the same suit he was arrested in eleven days before, John DeLorean walked from federal prison and embraced his wife. His travel is restricted to parts of California and New York. DeLorean 's next court appearance is in a week... [dog barking] [instrumental music] You fell for it. Fell for what? Jesus, John, what are you doing? I'd be within my rights to shoot you dead. John, don't be an idiot. Okay? It's only gonna make things worse. Just stop. [gun clicks] It's not really my style. [sighs] How are you, Jim? I'm okay. You? [chuckles] How's Cristina? Well, she's hired a designer to make her a new outfit for everyday of the trial. That's gonna be a long trial so... That's what we in the automobile industry call an exit strategy. Sorry to hear that. - John, I'm sorry about-- - No. Don't. You saw an opportunity and you took it. I trust you were amply rewarded. No. Boy, they always find a way to fuck us, don't they? Yeah. [intense music] Benedict: Stay focused. Stay calm. Stay honest. Look them in the eye. Be polite and respect. Howard: Mr. Hoffman, i-- it's quite simple, did John DeLorean suggest the drug deal? Because if he did, then he is a willing participant. But if he didn't, then he is the victim of an outrageous FBI entrapment. [dramatic music] So, which is it? Did John DeLorean suggest the drug deal? Jim: Well... [music continues] [mellow music] Can you help me, Jim? Well, it's hard to say. [indistinct chatter] [indistinct whispering] Judge Takasugi: Settle. Settle down. [gavel thudding] [music continues] [inhales sharply] "The United States of America versus John Z. DeLorean. We, the jury, in the above entitled case, find the defendant, John Z. DeLorean, not guilty as charged in count one. Not guilty as charged in count two. Not guilty as charged in count three. Not guilty as charged in count four. Not guilty as charged in count five. Not guilty as charged in count six." [indistinct chatter] Woman: Mr. DeLorean, will you plan to resume your career in the auto industry? Would you buy a used car from me? [all laughing] All you had to say was it was his idea. That's all you had to do. Well, you and your family can kiss goodbye to California. And say hello to Boise, Idaho. Because that's where witness protection is sending you. I'll make sure of that. It's been a long journey, but in the end, I think justice was served. Okay. Thank you, everyone. [indistinct chatter] [instrumental music] [phone ringing] Oh, that's a big help. Thanks. Ellen: Jim. The phone's for you. Can you pick it up? Honey? Babe, the phone's for you. Jim: Hello? Okay. Okay, leaving now. Alright. Bye. [laughs] [indistinct chatter] [instrumental music] Hello, John. How are you doing? My name will live in infamy. But I'm free. And single. I guess not everyone needs a DeLorean. [both laughing] Oh, that's good, that's good. Mm, so, wh... Now, what? What, uh... Well, I'm designing another car and this one is gonna have all the bits I was forced to leave out in the last one and it's gonna be... It's gonna be really special. Oh, you mean... something like that? [instrumental music] Figured I'd hold onto that for you on the off chance you might want it back someday. It means a lot, Jim. [music continues] Well, I've got to... [keys clanking] [music continues] Love this guy. [music continues] [engine cranking] [chuckles] Come on. Here we go. [upbeat music] You gotta be kidding me. [engine cranking] [sighs] [instrumental music] ¶ Oh ¶ ¶ Mama ¶ ¶ We're stopping at the green light girl ¶ ¶ Because I want to get your signal ¶ ¶ No going at the green light girl ¶ ¶ Because I want to be with you now ¶ ¶ You are my special ¶ ¶ You are my special ¶ ¶ You are my midnight midnight yeah ¶ ¶ So sweet ¶ ¶ So fine ¶ ¶ So nice ¶ ¶ All mine ¶ ¶ Mine mine ¶ ¶ Mine mine ¶ ¶ Ooooh ¶ ¶ Ooh ¶ ¶ Ooh ¶ ¶ Ooh ¶ ¶ Ooh ¶ ¶ We're stopping on the highway girl ¶ ¶ 'Cause I want to burn my gas ¶ ¶ There's one girl that I know I'm never gonna pass ¶ ¶ She is my special ¶ ¶ She is my special ¶ ¶ She is my midnight midnight yeah ¶ ¶ So sweet ¶ ¶ So fine ¶ ¶ So nice ¶ ¶ All mine ¶ ¶ Mine mine ¶ ¶ Mine mine ¶ ¶ Ooh ¶ [music continues] ¶ Oooooh ¶ ¶ Yeah ¶ ¶ So sweet ¶ ¶ So fine ¶ ¶ So nice ¶ ¶ All mine ¶ ¶ Mine mine ¶ ¶ Mine mine ¶ ¶ Ooh sugar ¶¶ [upbeat music] [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] [music continues]
