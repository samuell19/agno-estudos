Dumb bitch! Get off me! Let go of me! Stop moving! I told you shut up! You don't listen! You don't listen! Adrian get your head out of that cloud of smoke, son. You're finally getting parole, and now you're saying that you ought to stay? How am I supposed to face anybody? I'm going to leave here just to face people who think I should be in jail. Maybe they're right. No, that's wrong! Everyone deserves a second chance. God ordains it. Monica, it's not that simple. Forgiveness is that simple. It's people that make it complicated, so when you walk out of here you walk out of here with your head held high. And with me and pastor by your side we will get through this together. Only God can judge me. Tasha, we've got a million files on your desk right now. Let's just settle, throw in parole, and move on. You do realize that that's probably exactly what the prosecution was thinking when it came to my mother's murder? What? Yeah, my stepfather beat my mother's ass, was able to kill her in a fit of rage and call it a fight. That bastard walked after only seven years in jail. Jesus! Tasha, I had no idea. I'm so sorry, but this guy isn't your step-father and this isn't the same thing. The prosecution is doing the same thing. Come on in. Hi. Hi. You're Natasha Marshall, right? Yes, and you are? Attorney Joe Tucker. OK, well Mr. Tucker. Kara Baker. Nice to meet you. How can we help you today? You're representing, uh, Daisy Adams, correct? Correct. I have decided to represent her husband pro bono, and we're here to see if we can offer you a deal. What sort of deal? We'll settle for a misdemeanor, simple battery, and see if we can get him enrolled in some anger management classes. Simple battery? No way. This man put that woman in the hospital. Well, if you look at the police files you'll be able to see that-- I'm well aware of what the police file says, Mr. Tucker. OK, then you also are well aware that he was a victim as well. This was abuse. He received all kinds of injuries from this altercation, so therefore it would be unfair for him to receive any jail time if she doesn't. Mr. Tucker-- Joe. Please call me Joe. I'm not going to settle. OK, fine. Then I guess we'll just have to see each other in court. Thank you. Mr. Tuck-- Joe. Yes, Ms. Marshall? Or is it Mrs. Marshall? Honestly, I don't know because you're not wearing a wedding ring. Why did you take this case pro bono? I took this case because I wanted to be able-- No, let me guess. To make headlines? To make a great name for your new practice using the underdog? Oh no, wait. I'm sorry. To be the best DA the state has ever seen, right? I look at justice fairly, Ms. Marshall, from both ends. Sending Mr. Adams to jail for a few months is not going to rehabilitate him, but if he takes those courses that might just help. So, if you want to do probation, fine. We can do that for up to one year, but that's it. I don't believe in handing out simple punishment like giving people the death penalty, Ms. Marshall, or sending someone to timeout by just sending them to jail. It was a pleasure meeting you. I'll see you in court. Good day, Ms. Marshall. Watch your dress, baby. I can't believe we're finally doing this. My father is going to kill us! I mean, we're ready. Why wait? Listen. I want to thank you for believing in me. I can't believe we're finally going to be together after everything. But now it'll be forever? Yep. Forever ever. Forever ever. Forever ever, yes! But baby, you'll never get me out of your head. And why would I want to? Oh, sorry! Sorry. We're looking for the clerk's office. You know which way that is? Yeah, it's down the hall to the right. Thank you. Appreciate it. Baby? Ah, I'm coming baby! I'm sick and tired of this! Quit packing my shit! I will not have my girls growing up, thinking-- Bitch, shut the fuck up! Stop it! Packing my shit like I'm going somewhere! Get out. Get out! Get out! I ain't going no goddamn where! And we'll get that counseling you want, too. Shit! I don't want counseling. I want you to leave. I want you to leave me and my kids alone! They're my kids too! My kids don't need you! You're a monster. A sick, abusive-- What the fuck you say? Huh? You going stop packing my shit? Huh? Yes. And stop fucking crying. I ain't do nothing to you! Stupid bitch! I'm sitting here trying to work shit out, and you want to talk about fucking divorce? So you can fuck around with some other dudes? Fuck that! Here, show me where it says divorce! Show me where it says this. 911. What's your emergency? I just killed my girls and my step-kids. I think I'm about to murder my wife. Let's go. Brace yourself for this one. What's going on? Guy just shot up his family. He's waiting for us on his steps. Fuck. Let's get going. Joe? Yo. I just got an insane phone call. How much money are we talking about, Sheldon? Top dollar. So who got in trouble for touching somebody this time? Nowhere near that. Guy just shot his entire family for the second time. Twice? Yeah, talked to the mother over the phone. She's willing to pay anything. 50 grand for a detainer if we agree to take her son's case. So he killed his entire family? Crazy bastard murdered both of his stepkids and two of his own flesh and blood. Wow. And what about the wife? Tied her up and shot her. Made her watch. How the hell did this dude get out of jail in the first place? So, let me get this straight. 25 years ago this man stabs and kills his pregnant wife, does his time, is granted parole and let back into society to not only kill his stepchildren but kill his own children and damn near kill his wife? You can't make this stuff up, and he freely admitted to all of it. What? This is an open-and-shut case, Kara. Let me see the file again. Murder one definitely. Who helped him get out of jail? So, let me get this straight. So the woman who helped him get out of jail after he served time for the first murders is who he's with now, and he killed the kids that he had with her and his stepkids? Yep. Crazy, right? Him and his first wife went to the church where her father is a pastor. That's how they met. Wait, hold on. Are you telling me this dude found somebody to marry him after he killed his pregnant wife, and I can't even find anybody on this stupid ass app that I have on my phone that keeps telling me to swipe left and swipe right? And I'm swiping and swiping. Here's the file you wanted. Oh, appreciate it. This is the police file. Brace yourself. The pictures are gruesome. What kind of monster does something like this, man? Let's just work through lunch, and we'll look a little more closely at this. Yeah, that's sounds good. Tasha, it's not going to be murder one. Why the fuck not? He clearly did it before. He admitted to it. What more did they want to see? He's lawyered up. Of course he is. What snake DA is he working with? Good morning, mam. Joe Tucker, attorney at law. I want to let you know that I've been reviewing your son's case, and I think we'll be able to help you. I'm not surprised that someone like him would hire Joe to help him. I mean, Joe's entire motto is the devil has his story too. Damn Paradise Lost! So he is apparently trying to make bail. Bail? Yeah, OK. That's not happening. Bail hearing is tomorrow morning. OK, so the wife's family is going to be here then, too. Right? Yep. Tasha, we have to look at this entire case. I know you want capital punishment. We are going to look at this entire case closely, first. I just can't understand how a guy like this just murders his family. I mean, he should have never be released from prison in the first place. You know, situations like this make me sad for the children. Those poor babies, they didn't even get to live. And the mother? I mean, I don't see how she's making it. Didn't she get him out of jail in the first place? How do you invite a snake into your house? And then you're shocked when he bites? That's not fair. He must have convinced that he changed for her to risk her life and the lives of her children like this. There's no way I would ever let a monster like that convince me that he's not a monster. To put myself and children at risk like this. Mom! What are you doing? What are you doing? Adrian, don't! Not the babies. Don't hurt my babies, Adrian. What are you doing, man? They didn't do anything. They didn't do anything. I'm sorry. Adrian, I love you. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Adrian. No, don't. Don't hurt them, Adrian. My babies! Hello, Mrs. Brown. I'm Attorney Natasha Marshall and this is my co-counsel, Kara Baker. On behalf of myself and my entire team, we would like to extend our deepest condolences to you and your family. We're terribly sorry for your loss. Just call me Monica. Mr. Anderson, I was under the impression that Mrs. Anderson would be able to join us this afternoon. My wife can barely get out of bed. Of course. Understand. Well, I have reviewed this case and I can't tell you how disgusted I am by your husband. Monica, he deserves to rot in jail. He will pay for everything he's done to you and your babies. Please tell me he's getting the death penalty. Well, that's what I'm aiming for. Capital punishment. That's one of our priorities. We are looking to ensure that he receives punishment for his crime. Good, because I want to watch that nigger suffer his last and final breath just like my family is suffering right now. Well, we've charged him with four counts of murder first degree, torture, assault with intent to do bodily harm, unlawful imprisonment, possession of a firearm by a felon, and assault with a deadly weapon. Good. With all those charges he's definitely going to die now, right? Those are simply the charges, though. It's not the same thing as a conviction. What does that mean? Well, it means that the final verdict is what counts. What's important now is that you know that he has gotten an attorney. And a good one, too. We should focus on settling outside of court because he's-- I'm not settling shit. That son of a bitch killed my kids right in front of me. I know. I-- Mrs. Brown, I'm simply stating the facts. Monica, you should also know that he has a bond hearing later today. Bond? Why is that even an option? Mr. Anderson, it's just a hearing and we're going to plead to the judge to not allow him any bond. Let me get this straight. My sister's kids get killed, and you're talking about maybe letting him out on bond? And she said you're talking about selling out of court? What kind of-- Please understand that we're on your side but we have to look at the facts, and this is only a hearing for bond and the judge makes that decision. Not us. We can only plea that she doesn't grant it. Well, you better plea hard. Monica, I need you to trust me. I'm gonna get him. Now, I know that nothing can bring your babies back, but you can rest assured that his final days are now. I just feel if we present that evidence then we'll still have a case. You think so? Yeah. Baby. No touching. I'm Attorney Joe Tucker. I'll be defending-- I don't need no lawyer. Baby, please just listen to him! OK? Thank you, ma'am. You've been hit with 10 charges. Four of them are murder one. You're facing the death penalty. You think I don't know that? Look, now is not the time for you to play tough. Listen to the lawyer! Well, I feel that I can get you a lesser charge. What? Life in jail? I'd rather fry. Adrian, please! Why he ain't ask me if I did it? I don't have to ask you if you did it. You already admitted it. The bigger question that I have to prove, to keep you alive, is if you planned on doing all of it. No I didn't plan on that shit, man! Then that's the reasonable doubt I'm going to have to prove if we're going to court. The prosecution is coming for you, and I know the PA personally, she's going to want your head, man. What about you? What about me what? Don't you want my head? I don't want your mother to have to deal with burying yet another family member, and I would hope that you want the same thing either. She still feels that you can redeem yourself yet again. What do you think? It doesn't matter what I think, brother. My job is to plea bargain with the prosecutor to keep you alive and off death row and to close this case. That's it. Whatever, man. Oh, god. Your honor, I'm requesting no bond for Mr. Brown. He is facing five potential life sentences on top of death row. Your honor, if my client wanted to flee, why would he call the police on himself, turn himself in, and then not resist arrest? My client has been nothing but cooperative during this whole entire process, and we feel it would be in his best interest to spend the remainder of his time in his own home. I am pleading with you to deny bond to Mr. Brown due to the monstrousness of his crimes, your honor. Enough. I don't need bond. What did you say? I don't need bond. Then you won't receive it, and that wasn't in the cards anyway. But I'm glad to see that we're in agreement. Mr. Brown, do you understand the severity of the charges that have been leveled against you? I do, your honor. And how do you plead? Not guilty. You know what? Even for you this is low. Joe, why would you take this case? Why are you always doing this shit? Can't you be professional, Tasha? Stop fucking with me, Joe. I'm gunning for murder one. Murder one? Yeah. Come on, really? Yeah, this guy is clearly-- Excuse me. This guy is clearly guilty. You're not that hard up for money, are you? Money? Don't go there with me, Tasha. I take my hard cases for my own personal reasons just like you take yours. Yeah, but I take mine with a good conscience. You take yours with greed. How much are you charging this woman anyway? It's none of your business. Look, do you want to meet at the end of the week and we can see if we can come up with a deal? A deal? Yeah. Unless you're offering capital one, forget it. Capital one? Yeah. Come on, you and I both know this guy didn't plan on doing this. What I know is that he did it before. He clearly knew what he was doing and you know it. Where's the proof? OK, I'm not trying to say this dude is as a saint. OK, all I'm stating are the facts, and you and I both know he didn't plan on doing it. I'm getting murder one with capital punishment. You want to go to trial with me? I will if I have to. You made somebody a promise, didn't you? Yeah, you did. I told you about making promises that you can't keep touch, Tasha Marshall. Hello, Kara. It's always a pleasure to see you. Yeah, have a good day ladies. You all right? We're going to iron out this case and find every single flaw possible. You shouldn't have told the family that we could even touch murder one. Joe-- Maybe you didn't hear me, Kara. We're going to iron out this case and find every single flaw possible. Understand? Can you believe that Joe is actually trying to go for third degree murder for this Mr. "I want to slaughter my family"? Third degree? OK, whatever. He just wants to get his client off death row. No, he plans on arguing that his client was mentally distraught when committing these crimes. So now he's crazy? No, Joe is fucking crazy. Tasha! Proving beyond reasonable doubt capital punishment is just too risky. Look, these are the facts. He places those girls in a car and allows it to fill with carbon monoxide. When he knows that they're dead he places them in their beds, but here with the other two he clearly shot them several times to make sure that they were dead. But that doesn't show intent. Kara, we have Home Depot receipts from a week prior to the murder showing he bought identical piping to that what was found in the car where the girls were killed in. Right, but we still need more. The murder of the stepkids showed rage, not calculation. As for the stepkids, he uses their deaths, allows the mother to live to not only witnessed them dying but to live with the fact that they are dead. It's like he wanted to forever traumatize her, and that right there isn't premeditated? I see what you're saying, but-- He called the cops just like he did 25 years ago to let them know he killed his pregnant wife, but this time he killed his kids and was about to kill his other wife? Both reports state that he was sitting on the steps waiting for them and didn't resist arrest. This man admitted to both crimes. But does that constitute premeditation? Did he buy the gun recently? Do we have a web history showing where he researched how to kill with carbon monoxide? When did he get the box cutter he used to slash Monica's face? These are all questions that Joe's going to bring up at trial, and we have to be prepared to answer them. I'm fucking tired of Joe! I'm tired of this guy! This is an open-and-shut case, Kara! I know. I know it's shitty. Maybe if we take death penalty off the table maybe he'll agree to life in prison no parole. No, I want capital punishment! This monster needs to die! This monster is going to get what he deserves. Its not about what he did. It's about what we can prove in court. Tasha, you know this! I know that he is a killer, and I'm not going to let a killer walk! He'll walk if we go to trial for capital punishment. Joe will slaughter us. I am not going to let him get away with this again! Tasha, this guy isn't your stepfather. Don't you think I know that? I fucking know that, Kara! Did you see all his files that you just knocked over? Those are a bunch of people who need our help, and if we take this case to trial they have to suffer even longer and wait god knows how long on justice. Well, is it fair that he gets to live? Or walk! What if we don't win? Kara, we are going to win! Not murder one we aren't. God, Tasha, you got to take your emotions out of this and think! Reasonable doubt is all Joe has to create and we're done. Listen, I need to reach an agreement with you. OK, Tasha? Just so we'll be able to progress forward. I can't believe you had the nerve to bring up third degree, Joe. The death penalty is not going to do anything for his family. Killing him is not going to bring those kids back. Killing him will not heal anyone. And what the fuck do you know about healing, Joe? Adrian Brown is a calculated murderer, and he deserves to die. Do I need to remind you that it was your clients who got him out of jail in the first place? I'm aware of that. And you're also well aware that your client knew him well before he committed the first murders. I know that, too. And you know that I have multiple letters from Ms. Monica Brown, your client, stating that she knew about his mental state of health. Maybe a pending divorce or being kicked out of his home. Things like this could lead him to snap. These are words from your client. And what is your point, Joe? My point is, for you to be able to prove without reasonable doubt that he supposedly mastermind this whole ordeal-- Wait, wait. I'm sorry. So murdering two small children and two innocent teenagers is an ordeal? Really? I'm saying he didn't do it with full malice, Tasha, so can we please just settle? I'm thinking about second degree murder with the possibility of parole. Get the fuck out of here. Parole? Why? So he could just walk right out of jail again? No! Again, do I need to remind you that it was your clients who got him out of jail in the first place? Well, since your clients seem to think he can change why shouldn't we? I'm done with this conversation. You need to take the deal, Tasha. You do not want to go to trial, Tasha. Bye, Joe. So I'll handle the family tomorrow. What do you mean? Alone? Yep. No. I can't let you do that, Kara. It's clear you're too emotionally involved in this case. They cannot hear this from you. And why not? It's a Black thing. Well make it an attorney thing, because if you go in there tomorrow they will eat you alive. They need to hear this from me. Well, hear this from me. Stay home. I've got this. OK. Nice to see you all again. Mrs. Anderson, I presume? Thank you for helping us. It's my pleasure. It's nice to meet you. I'm Kara Baker, co-counsel along with Attorney Natasha Marshall. Yeah, where is Ms. Natasha? She is in court, so I will be updating you on the progress of the case today. We have agreed to a plea bargain with Mr. Brown's attorney. We've accepted a plea of second degree murder. You did what? Plea deal? This bitch ain't serious! What does this mean? He gets to get away with this? Absolutely not. It just means the death penalty is off the table because-- Natasha said that she could get us the death penalty. Attorney Marshall and I-- She didn't even have the nerve to come tell us to our face that she couldn't deliver! So she sent you? No one sent anyone. I'm co-counsel-- I don't give a damn who you are! He doesn't deserve to live. Mr. Anderson, proving murder one is not an easy task but we're-- Proving y'all are good attorneys is not an easy task! I don't understand. He admitted to doing this. He said he did it. Monica's a witness! It's not about witnesses. We need proof. I'm not agreeing to the plea bargain. We aren't trying to prove that he didn't do it. We need to prove that he thought these crimes through. Of course he did! We need more evidence, Monica. It's not that simple. Well, maybe he should just go kill six more people so you guys can find more evidence! It's about presenting the facts to the jury and eliminating any possibility of reasonable doubt. He shot me in the foot so I couldn't leave. He tied my hands so I couldn't help my kids. He shot my kids right in front of me. He tortured me! If that's not intent, what the fuck is intent then? We aren't saying what he did wasn't intentional. We're saying we cannot prove that it was premeditated. So, when he said I'd be sorry for trying to leave him, that wasn't premeditated? That was a threat, and threats do not equal someone who plans out murdering. So what does it mean? We are working to ensure that he never walks free again. Is that where Natasha is? Working on it? Walks free. At least he can walk. He'll get his meals, gym, TV, and everything else taxpayers pay for him. Books, health care. He'll get a second chance at life again, but you know who won't? My babies. They won't get a second chance to laugh, breathe. You said you were working on making sure he never walks free again, and now you're telling me there's a chance of parole? All rise. Court is now presiding. Your honor, all parties are sworn in. You may proceed. Everybody please be seated. OK, now that we have agreed on the charges, does the victim wish to make a statement? Yes, your honor, Mrs. Brown would like to make a statement. Is it all right with you if her sister joins her for support? Yes, that would be fine. Thank you. State your name for the record. Monica Brown. You may proceed, Ms. Brown. Good morning, your honor. I want to be clear that I do not agree with the plea bargain, but at this point nothing will bring my children back, so I'll never truly see justice. Six lives. Six lives. This animal killed two beautiful girls that just wanted to play in the park, an artist and a young woman getting ready to go to college. Generous, beautiful kids. My children were my world. My girls were always singing, dancing, and playing dress-up. My oldest daughter wanted to help people. She would have made an amazing social worker or a doctor. My son. My son wanted to be a writer and bring stories to life. Every Christmas they wanted to go to the homeless shelter to give toys to kids who had less than them. They went out of their way to help people, expecting nothing in return. They were angels on earth, and now they're angels in heaven. Adrian, my family and I took you in our lives and believe you changed, but you proved us wrong. You satisfy Satan's work, and for that he'll reward you in a place in hell. You said the day we got married that I will never forget you, and you have that. I won't, but you also said that dreadful night that I'll be in hell with you, but you're wrong. I'm strong enough to stand here in front of the man that brutally murdered my children and tell him that you did not win. Your honor, if the death penalty is taken off of the table so be it, but please don't let this monster out of his cage. Honestly, your honor, I can't think of much to say other than that this man is evil and disgusting. The plea agreement was not decided overnight and, although we did get much of what we asked for, parole is still on the table. Mr. Brown will likely not be eligible for parole until his late 80s. I urge the court to please see to it that that never happens. Thank you. Mr. Brown, do you have anything you want to say? Yeah. I know God still has my life in his hands, your honor. Something will come out of this. I regret this and I'm sorry for it. All I ever wanted was a family, your honor. Someone to support and respect me. I didn't get that, but I miss my girls and I'm sorry. Liar! Order! Only God can judge me. Mr. Brown, this court has seen a lot of cases but by far this is the worst. I don't believe you understand what a father and a husband is supposed to do. A husband is supposed to protect his wife and his children. Do you really believe that your actions showed that? Your inability to take responsibility for your actions is what bothers me the most. This case and the facts with it and the agreement. You will never be released from prison. The only reason I don't demand this to go to trial is because of Mrs. Brown. I don't want her to have to ever hear and relive all of this again. I agree to the sentencing plea. Court is dismissed. Adrian! Killer! Liar! Oh, god! I hate you, Adrian! Order! Eat something. Not hungry. The case? Yeah. I'm sorry, but she asked for it. That man had no remorse. You saw him in court! She didn't ask for it. Be real! He might have changed, but those demons inside of him didn't or they returned. Whatever happened 25 years ago returned with vengeance. Some women just don't want to be single. Maybe she was desperate and got tired of being alone, so she got with him. What she saw in him is what we all see in someone we think changed, a flawed person. Love is not that simple! Love is very simple. What complicates love are decisions, and her decision meant death. That wasn't Monica's decision! That was his! So she's innocent? Has no part in this? Don't shame her for falling in love. I mean, that's something we don't have any control over. She's grieving enough. I know everyone who's touched this case will forever be impacted, everyone involved in this case. Our lives changed because of this horrendous act. You tried your best, Tasha. So I've got to ask you, man-- Wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Let me talk to him. Why are you doing this, man? Because my mama sold her house to pay you? Yeah and no. I don't just take any old murder case, man. Your mother actually persuaded me that you were still human and not a monster who just murdered his kids, and tortured the only woman who actually gave a damn about your ass in the first place. Cool, so she just cut you a check. That's what I thought. I'm good, man. You can go. Wait, hold on. The only reason I fought for your life in the first place was because I didn't want your mother to deal with yet another death. You stole six lives, Adrian. One that never saw the light of day. The others were just getting started. Only God can judge me, man. Yeah God is judging you, man. Believe that, and if it wasn't for your mother I wouldn't give a fuck about what they did with your sorry ass! Think about that. I didn't want to hurt them. But you did. You murdered your kids, man. All for what? Because you got mad, huh? Because you found out your wife wanted to leave you? Nah, I'm not going to let them kill you. As a matter of fact, I'm going to make sure they keep you alive just so you can spend the rest of your life in smoke. Smoke? Yeah, in smoke, because in smoke you can't see nothing. Matter of fact, you can barely breathe. You don't know what's coming and what direction it's coming from. You are in hell in constant panic. May you never be able to see nothing but grayness and fog. May you to never be able to breathe the same. May you to never be able to see a future just like the lives you took can never have one. May you live the rest of your life and die in smoke.
