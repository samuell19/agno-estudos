THE GREAT FAMILY - My hair - Come on, Críspulo! Get up! Luisa, have you seen Anthony Perkins' last movie? - No. - Well go and see it. You brute. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Hi. Good morning, grandpa. - The water is freezing! I'm always late. - Good morning, grandpa. - Cue up. - Antonio, hurry up, you bore. - Hi, Mercedes. - Hi. - Good morning. - So, are you going on a trip? - I'm leaving this house. Everyone leaves sooner or later. But you've lasted less than all the others. I was afraid to go nuts. Look at this, ma'am. I'm growing grey hair. Don't worry. Dyed hair is in now. I can't stand another hour is this house! I don't know why. Críspulo! I've told you not to fire rockets inside the house. Yes, mom. You're such a beast You're going to burn us alive. What a beautiful spring day. That boy is a terrorist! A bomber! An arsonist! A guerrilla! Gustavo, you've got to put an end to this outrage! You're president of the neighbors committee. There's not much a president can do here. We would need a King. - Breakfast is ready! - Come on, get up. - Breakfast is ready! - Good! Breakfast is ready! Breakfast is ready! You know I'm starving? - Really? - Always complaining! Don't sit in my chair. I want it. - I'm sitting with Guillermo. - Okay. - Julio César. - Octavio Augusto. Críspulo. - Victoria Eugenia. - Sabina. - And you? - Mónica. Grandpa has come to investigate which one of you is the bandit who steals my comics to cover his books. You forgot again my cookies. There's only toast. ¿ You think my teeth are the same as yours? - Here you are. - Too far for me to reach them. You glutton, wait for your father. - Good morning, family! - Good morning, dad! Give me the sugar. - What a way to eat! - They're healthy. "Ookie". Chencho. "Ookie". Chencho. He says he wants a cookie. Well I'm not giving him one until he ask for it properly. It's not the cookie. I want him to learn. Cookie. Cookie. Cheese and quince. I don't like it, mom. - Then eat the cheese only. - Cheese is what I don't like. Then give it to me. - Ouch! Shoot! - Don't curse, you bad boy! This quince is stale, mom. Eat and shut up, you picky eater! And be a good girl. Or you wont take the Holy Sacrament. I'll be good. I promise. Are you going to bay me a dress - like Sofia's, the Greek queen? - Yes. With a very, very long veil? I want mine to be an admiral's, with lots of badges. You're already got one. Today I'll cook your favorite dish. By now I like everything. - Lentils and rice. - Very nutritious. - And meatballs with sauce. - Bocatto di cardinale. - Come home early. - You bet! - Dad, your pills. - Thanks, honey. Goodbye. - You're forgetting something. - Me? Nothing. - Me. Money, that green stuff. - My God! Take it yourself. We have to pay the pharmacy the telephone and the gas. Do you think I make this bills? I'm not such a good artist. - Lend me something for fuel. - Here. - Bye. - Bye I just baked those and those yesterday. No, no. You've got to learn our ways. First we put out yesterday's and when there are none left, we put out today's so the ones left from today will be available tomorrow. Otherwise, tomorrow we'd have to put out yesterday's and they would be the ones from the day before yesterday. Hello, godfather! Easy! Pirates! Bandits! Rascals! Don't you have breakfast at home? - Get out! - Goodbye, handsome. - Are all your godchildren? - Only 5. That would be a ruin. And it is, because in the end I act as the godfather for the whole family. A great burden, I see. Javier, what do you think of this bathroom? - Big bathtub, don't you think? - The best. 6 feet. So you won't have to bend your legs. Now I only need a sign on the door saying: "Only for me, exclusively private". - Is it for you? - I wish. No, it's for that big house in Corea's neighbourhood. Project Department. Foreman Alonso speaking. Yes, sir. Right now. I'll be right over. Bye. Hey, if the boss comes over cover me up. I'm going to deliver this. - Where are you going now? - First to one place and then to another one. Today I've only got two. You want a hand in here? It's ready. Otherwise I wouldn't leave. Second floor is finished. - Here. - Thank you. - And here we have the blueprints. - All off them? All except the penthouse. And don't worry, because I'm way ahead of them. - Anything else? - When will they be ready? In two days. If you have any doubt, you can call me in a while at the Ministry. - Thanks. Bye. - Good bye. If it was up to him, he would build Madrid's Tower. And he would fill it up with kids. You're late! Do you want to ruin the company? The workers are idle because they don't have a lousy blueprint to follow! Everyone is waiting for you! It's outrageous. Have you seen the traffic jam? Too many people in Madrid. We would have to build it again, but much wider. And besides, we have to expand. Satellite cities: Alcalá, Guadalajara, Aranda. What's that got to do with your job and mine? ¿And with theirs? Yes, sure. That's two different things. My job is done. Look at this. Look at the detail. I've solved the separation with an iron fence. And this? A small ledge. You told me: "That the side looks dull, think about something." And I've thought about a small ledge. I see you've thought about everything. Mr. Pedro, you gave me the whole project on the phone. Because I trust you. And that's why you have to be on time. And the facade? Where's the facade? The facade? It's not finished yet, but I've come up with a fabulous idea for the facade. Very good. We'll do the grand opening without the facade. - I've just haven't had enough time. - The only thing you don't have, time. All the rest? You have too much. Too many jobs. Too many kids. It's not my fault. Well, it is a bit your fault. Well, I would say so. Yes, sure. You're right, Mr. Pedro. The truth is that all that troop overwhelms me. You'll have to look for another foreman. No, I don't want another foreman, I want you, but I also want the blueprints, specially the facade. The facade? You'll have it. Father's word. I'll draw you a façade that you'll laugh at Burgos' cathedral. The tourist guides will include: "Mr. Pedro's facade". You'll see. Tomatoes. 12 pounds. Pounds. Nowadays anything is a pound. Ma'am, a pound is anything that has 12 ounces. I'm paying you with pesetas, which have 100 cents. Do you want some lettuce? They look gorgeous. And the heart? Where's the heart? Sure, down there, lost among the leaves. Well, how much? - Four. - My God! Lettuce is just something green that grows alone in the fields. And green beans? Very tender. Besides, just like telephone, without lines. - What shall we serve tonight? - Beans and tomato, mum. They've got more vitamins. - How much? - Five per half a pound. And 10 for the whole. It's outrageous. You only have dig a little hole in the ground, throw a bean inside and wait for the rain. - How many do you want? - Four. Four. And I'll also take 2 of bananas. Mum, that's only 17 we are 18. Then he should give us one for free. Sure. Kid, stop eating cherries. I can't make it for lunch. I'm the one who's sorry, but I can't. Mr. Pedro got stubborn as always and I have to finish the facade. Yes, yes, of course. But this time he's right. How are the meatballs? Save me some for tonight. No. I didn't forget my pills. Of course I'm going to eat. Bye. Bye. What are you doing here so late? I was finishing something. - The bathrooms, uh? - No. This is not for you. It's another thing, but I brought it over here because it was on my way. It's a project for the Bug. - What Bug? - Who else? The Bug. I'll start your project right away. This is done. I just have to put it in ink. And now your kid will be sucking his thumb. Remember when you brought me the blueprints for a cabaret wrapped in some diapers? Is this the Studies and Projects Department? - Yes, sir. - Well. You can keep the studies and the projects, but the Department is coming with me. Come on. Hey! Wait a minute! Wait! But Mr. José! The court again? Yes, son. This year's embargo. - Then I won't have my pay. - That's right, but don't worry, I'll fix it in a couple of days. A couple of days or a couple of months... or a couple of years, if it goes to the Supreme Court. - Don't be so pessimistic. - Pessimistic? I'm the king of optimism. But if I try to pay a debt with optimism they tell me that it's not a legal currency. I want something more trendy. A model Sofía. - Which Sofía? - The one from Greece from Athens. Don't tell me you don't know who she is. I know who she is. But she got married. And down sized it's for the Holy Sacrament, the dream of every girl. Why should I break my girl's dream? - Why? - I'm not saying anything. You call this an admiral uniform? That's how they're labeled. I'm not an expert. Always looking the other way. I think there's some stripes missing. And decorations. And golden cords with tassels. Do you think admirals wear that? Why not? They're the bosses. - Slow down, Mercedes. - Just in time. You like fishing, you should know about navy uniforms. Drop the navy, the whole fleet has sunk. - What happened? - The first torpedo has sunk - my extra pay. - They haven't paid you? I'm on the creditors cue. Well that's a conflict. We've lived through lots of conflicts. Compared to us, the Caribbean is a dead calm pond. Ma'am, what shall we do with the admirals? Yeah. Send them to the Sixth Fleet. Attention! Attention! Space rocket for the moon ready to launch! Martians! Prepare to die! - There they are! - Hi, dad. - Hi, mom. - Hi, dad. - Hi. - Hi. - Hi, dad. - Mom give me a kiss. - Hi, dad. - Careful, son. - And our uniforms? - Is mine pretty, mum? And it has a very, very long veil. - And some cords? - And some decorations? - Yes. - And a sword? Not a sword. You think you're going as the Cid? Well, that's enough. Forget that. We're about to reach Saturn. - That's the way to go. - Let's go to Saturn. And where are the uniforms? They'll deliver them later. Come on, go and play. - Let's play! - To Saturn. And say hi to Superman. - What's wrong with him? - Nothing, it's just a whim. Why did you tell them they'll deliver the uniforms? We always have to tell them the truth. It's the truth. They'll be delivered. They'll have to take the Holy Sacrament - with just a navy cap. - They'll take it the way they want. - I don't see how? - Me neither yet. I'll come up with something. I'm the one should come up with something, but I can't. Always trying to meet ends. Sometimes I fall in despair. Come on, honey. Yes. I always have the feeling to be the verge of being a loser. I haven't been able to give you what you wished. Look at me, I'm not even an architect. But you've made a future architect. You've given me not only your hopes, but 15 hopes. Yes, you're right. Even if we don't have money, we're the richest in the world in hopes, flesh and blood hopes. We'll have so much in the family! A doctor, a lawyer, a diplomat... A diplomat? Not Críspulo, that's for sure. He'll be something big, but never a diplomat. - Maybe one will make it to Minister. - Why not? And they'll call us their honorable parents. - You hear that? - That one is going to be a soprano. Such a vocal range! Such a texture! You get on with your things and leave it to me. What are you going to do? Use some hand me downs? I wish. Remodeled, dyed... What's left I use them as kitchen rags. This time we need another solution. Mum, I can't make her shut up. I've given her the fruit purée and nothing. She keeps crying. And think someday they'll pay millions to hear her sing at the Scala in Milan. Record. 26 minutes a round trip to Las Rozas. - Tomorrow in 20. - Someday you'll crash. I'll crash you if you don't shut up. Give me my briefcase. And I've been attending class in case the sergeant drops by. - Here. And you. - I smoke too. Come on, you have to rest from your trip to Las Rozas. I see you also smoke your classes. It was Physics. I always choke on it. It'll be worse when dad asks for your grades at the end of the year. I can't believe you... - Another lecture? - I tell you these things in case it does any good, although I don't think is does. Don't you like to have fun once in a while? Once in a while, yes. You live in a constant party. - Good bye, Antonio. - Bye. Tomorrow we have party and twist. We'll be expecting you. Not tomorrow. Sunday for sure. Bye, beauties. Hey, drop the sergeant thing. Save that for the army. They'll straighten you up there. We're going to the cinema, are you coming? - Bye. - Bye. - Bye. - Bye. - Are you going out tomorrow? - I'm not sure. - And if I pick you up? - Why are you so interested? Because I like being with you. Then I'll see you tomorrow. Ciao, Merche. - The engineer made up his mind. - Don't be silly. Alberto is a good friend. He's only Industrial Assistant. Maybe he's afraid of the future family. You'll have to walk, by your own means, the elevator is out of order. - What's new? - It's Mr. Críspulo's fault. He's always doing barbarisms. The last one: he has torn away the bell ring of the first floor. - What a barbarism. - And it doesn't ring? Well, it does ring, but who rings gets an electric shock. - That is, an electrolysis. - Electrolysis? Yes, sir. Exactly. Don't get in here. They're dangerous. - Lion. - Quiet, lion. Easy, lion! Easy! Don't bother the champ, he'll top off Di Stefano. He'll be the one supporting the family. - Come on, count. - Lies! It's all lies! Drop that, you insolent. Don't listen to him. About time. Give me a hand. This baby is leaking. Let's play the circus! It's going to be the best of all. - That's it. - Good. - Sorry. It slipped my hands. - Do you think this is the Bernabeu? - Daddy! - Hi, baby. - Hi, dad. - Hi. - Hi, dad. - Don't tell me! What if there's an urgent call? You've got "telephonitis"? She just doesn't stop dad. Well, you can tell me all that tomorrow. - Dad. - What, son? You look like a total clown. Well, isn't there anyone else he could fit in this hallway? - ¡Tamer! - Mum threw us out of the dining room. - Someone came to visit. - I'll be back. You and I will talk later, Mr. Ringbreaker. What a dream. The girl is going to look beautiful. And the only thing the boy will be missing is going to be a battleship. Oh, my! See? Everything is solved thanks to the godfather. Yes, who always has to put out the fire. Here you think I'm Rockefeller's grandson and Onasis' brother in law. I wish. We could use a godfather like that in this house. You think I'm not enough? You've got good spirit, but you're just average. - And you're on sale. - Goal! End of the first round. Always the same. Me? I'm throwing the towel. I give up. Sure. You were willing... to let your kids take the Holy Sacrament in T-shirts, like tourists. No, sir. That's why I'm here for. When I took them out of the baptismal basin and said all there is to say and that now I know by heart. And now I have to carry that burden. Well said. You have to meet your duties. And the godfather is the father's substitute. The substitute when there's no father. And here there is one, big and strong. But you only know how to do little drawings and scribbles. Well, if there's nothing else, I'm leaving, because I've abandoned my shop. And that's enough. - I don't know what to say. - Just say good night. If you want, I can go down to buy you some cigarettes. Don't bother to give me money, the Godfather is here. Yes, but be quick. Dad's coming. - Come on, come on. - Quiet! Quiet! There's plenty for everyone! Lemon! Coffee and milk! Be careful! NEWS Grandpa, if you eat so many sweets, you'll grow worms. This is the first one. And it's a mint, I don't like it. Silence! The movie is about to start. - Let's see which one is it. - I hope it's got gunshots. If it's not for kids, you're going to bed. Nor kids nor adults. The show is over. - What a drag. - That guy is heartless. Son, enough of that. Come on, everyone to bed. Come on. Let's go to bed. Come on. - Come on. - Come on Dad, why don't you buy us a TV set? Maybe if we win the soup coupons prize... You can buy it on credit. Buy whenever you want and pay whenever you can. That's the glitch. I can't. Bye, son. Dear little Jesus. - Dear little Jesus. - You're a kid like me. - Dear little Jesus. - You're a kid like me. - That's why I love you so much. - That's why I love you so much. - And I give you my heart. - And I give you my heart. - Cross yourselves. - Amen. - Turn off the light soon. - The tale. - The tale. - What is he saying? He's saying grandpa should tell us a tale before we go to sleep. - But a short one. - Yes. - Mom, come here. - Grandpa, hand me Whitey. No, grandpa. Today's my turn. She's right. It's an odd day. Here. Leave that. You're going to grow nearsighted. Grandpa asked me to sew him this button. Well, we can sew this later, okay? And what's wrong with you? Tell me. Don't let grandpa tell any tales. He scares me. And she has nightmares. The other night she fell off the bed. I saw a ghost in the hallway. Come on, ghost in this house? There's no room for them. Good night and sweet dreams. Mum, hang the dress so I can see it. Look, mum. Another half an inch. At this rate, you'll soon run out of meter. - Have you said your prayers? - Yes, mum. Say them again. I want to hear you. Mum, tomorrow we're going to have lunch very late. Why don't you give me my sandwich now? God, honey, it's like if you had a tapeworm. thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day, our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us. My, you have grown, baby. Come on, step down from those stilts. You don't know the suffering those torture tools give you. You'll have plenty of time to... What's that on your face? That's how you ruin the pillows. It's cream, mom. I have pimples. The woman's skin has only one good time, between pimples and wrinkles. - Is there anything you want to tell me? - The same as always. But what does that boy say to you? He talks to me about his things, sports, his works mates, engines... Specially about engines. I think he doesn't know to express himself. Tell me, mom, how did dad proposed to you? I only remember I said yes right away. I was so anxious. Me too. But nothing. Actually, men never propose themselves, we are the ones forcing them to do it. - Tell me how. - There are no rules, honey. It's intuition... It's been so long. Merceditas, honey, can you sew me this button? Not now, grandpa. Can't you see? Doctors only sew with gloves. - Hey, hubby... - Yes? In 2 days we've got the washing machine payment. Don't forget it. - How much? - Four hundred something. - Hey. - Yes? - And Monday the refrigerator. - That's still going on? There's 2 more including this one. 830 per bill. - Hey, hubby - Yes? I love you. I know. I love you too. Hey, son, can you spare me a cigarette? If I don't smoke, I can't get to sleep. Take as many as you want. Just one. Tomorrow I'll buy some and I'll give it back to you. Why are you sewing that, dad? If everyone else abandons me, I have to look up for myself. I'm less than nothing. That's what I am. It's the sad fate of retired people. Retirement is hell. That's the truth. They should only retire old people. - Hey, hubby. - I know. We love each other. A lot, yes. But remember also the books payment. Damned collection. I've been paying for 2 years. Each month they send us another volume. You're right. Everything for arts. It's so nice right now. Both of us alone talking about our things. Yes. It's nice to be like this. So quiet and peaceful. - Mum, water! - Mum, I've got to pee! I'm coming! I promise I'll be good and that I wont do another prank never ever again. More cream! Come on, the whipped cream cone, fill it up. See? You're not following the craftsman rules. - Don't squeeze so hard. - It's not pouring enough. But if you squeeze too hard... I don't want any stains. Be careful. Leave them alone. It's a special day. Besides, a little stain doesn't harm nobody. And you could give me a hand. After all, they're your kids. Not after all. They're mine all the way. Waiter! I mean, godfather. - What's up? - We could use a bit of champagne. Just a sip. - Champagne, uh? - Sure, Champagne for us. You're only serving cream pies for the kids. You're so handsome... What's my physical beauty got to do with that? - Hey godfather, and the cigars? - What cigars? What do you mean what cigars? The cigars. Those long chocolate coloured things you smoke? Sure. - Wrapped in plastic paper? - An usual. Or in crystal tubes, with a band and the fat lady's picture? - Those are the good ones. - Well there's no cigars. If you want to smoke, chicken sauce. - You look like 2 bankers. - I'm the banker. He's just a sponger. Stop growling. Thanks to this family you're going to be famous - You'll have a Minister for godson. - Which one? Anyone. And a Picasso and an ambassador in Egypt. I can see you bragging in Cairo. Don't joke about that. It many be true. We can use this for Sabina and then for Mónica and one day for Lutgarda. And if things turn out okay, maybe they also can wear something new. You mean if things turn out okay for the godfather, as always. - I'll get it. - Excuse me. Today's been a great day for us. Do you think it's proper to come home so late? I've been studying with a classmate. And what have you studied? "Stranger From the West" or "Death Ranch"? - Those are from the other day. - Really? They've got today's date. Your bad behaviour, your lack of study before a test is pathetic. But don't lie, son. Never lie. You have to face your acts with bravery. - But... - We'll talk tomorrow. Now go to bed. Be patient with him. One had to turn out a rebel. But he's a good kid. I know. But I have to punish him somehow. Don't be so strict. I know you. You think it doesn't hurt me? Yes. When you're right, you're right. Well, I'm going to sleep. You and everybody. Tonight I'm not working. - I'm going to sleep like a baby. - Mom, I'm very sick. Mom, come here. It's hurts, mommy. Come here. It hurts so bad, mom. Here. It's appendicitis. Don't be so exaggerated. - I'll prepare a hot water bag. - Mommy! I'm going to see what's wrong with the girls. Mom, it hurts. Mom, it hurts. - Me too. - My tummy aches. That's nothing, honey. Rub, rub and you're healed. - Are you feeling better? - No. It hurts more. Well, don't cry. It'll be over soon. - My tummy aches, mom. - You too? Carlos, they're getting sick all at once. - It must be something they ate. - The cake! The cake. Of course, your damned sweets. God knows the filth you use. Your pastries, your chocolates and those powders you throw in to give them color... - One day you'll poison them. - And now it's my fault. I nearly go broke and they compare me to Lucrecia Borgia. - I can't stand it. - Stop arguing and call the doctor. Okay, but don't worry, honey. 38.5. Always the same. Tell us, what is it? As a doctor, I'd say it's a "gastroenterocolitis". Get to the point. Speak clear and in common language. They're completely bloated. - And what do you prescribe? - As a doctor, "Sulfatalidín". As a friend, lemonade. Hey, doctor, tell me the truth. Can this be product of a couple of cakes? - A couple of small little cakes? - Sure. If they've eaten cakes - it's only that. I'm positive. - See? Double dose for him. He's the one in worst condition. - But he hasn't even blinked. - He's too bloated. Give your father "Sulfatalidín" every 3 hours and lots of lemonade. Prescriptions. Third grade Latin tests, room 8. Algebra and Trigonometry, room 12. You and you are done. Come back in September. Okay, you may leave. - Who discovered America? - Christopher Columbus. What were the names of the 3 caravels? The Pinta, the Niña and the... The Santa... - The San - The Holy Virgin. - Oh no, mister, the Santa María. - Mr. Luis, the phone. Don't move, okay? Silence! Who were the Catholic Kings? Isabel and Fernando. No, mister. Melchior, Gaspar and Belshazzar. Silence! You, who was the first man to travel around the world? - Juan Sebastián Elcano. - No, mister. Cantinflas. 8 in History and 0 in Behaviour. Let's see, miss. Tell us something about the Ebro. Ebro. The Ebro starts... starts at... At Rei... - no-sa. - Reinosa! Very good. - Province of San... - San Sebastián. Did she say Santander? I didn't hear that. Me neither. Santander, isn't it? Yes, sir. Santander. - Santander. - Very good. - And it flows into the... - Into the sea. Undoubtedly, like all the rivers, - but into the Me... - Di... - Te... - Rranéo. One last question. How many provinces does Spain have? I think around 40 or 50. Isn't it? That's it. Around that. Well, that's enough. - So cute! - Lovely! - Done! Relax! You're making me nervous. - Put yourself in my shoes. - I don't want to. I've got mine. I have 9 kids doing tests in 3 schools, 4 high schools and 3 specialized colleges. Even when I did my official exam I wasn't so scared. I thought eventually it would go away. It's getting worse. Since you don't have kids, no problem. I've got yours. No, it's not the same. Kids suffer a lot, but parents... - Look. - No. I know. Antonio worries me. Today's the last test. Don't worry about that. He'll pass. Trust me. Yeah, he'll pass. And in 4 years, architect. Something I didn't achieve. Can you imagine? Antonio Alonso, Architect. In big letters. And below, in small letters, of course, Carlos Alonso, foreman. And that in 1 fence, 2 fences, 20 fences along the new Gran Vía. - And? - Bad. I failed... - And the others? - I passed. Which one was it? Analytic Geometry, I know it. - No, Design. - Design? But that's your specialty. What happened? How come you failed? - I can't understand it? - Well I've failed. - One subject failed is not humiliating. - It is for me. I know you've studied hard and that you came well prepared. Every project you've helped me with have turned out okay, perfect. Come on boy. Cheer up. Life is grading you with a 10 everyday. Cheer up, up with that spirit, son. Let's thank God, He'll test all of us and He'll know who to pass. Come on. The baker has fooled me for good. If I see him... Come on, it's a very nice house. You'll see. This house is crazy. Look, mom! Stupid! Look at my grades! - What am I here for? - You don't know them all. - You could let in a stranger. - How many are you? A lot. You'll get to know us if you last long enough. Look, mom, with my picture. And a merit prize. Fantastic, son. Congratulations. Can I have a foie gras sandwich? Even two. You deserve it. - How about Críspulo? - Good grades overall. Sevens, eights, some nines... Except in behaviour. My teacher is obsessed with me. Really? Even Job would be obsessed with you if he resurrected. - Come on. - Dad! Mom! Dad! Look what I've got. What do you think? - Gym champion. - Very good, boy! That's how Real Madrid started. - You'll be world champion. - And the other subjects? An A, two B and the rest C. That's great, champ. You've earned a good vacation. You can learn how to swim. - Can I go to the pool? - Much better, to the sea? To the sea! Hurrah! The sea! The sea! What did you just say about the sea? Are you sick or something? Are you running a fever? - No. I'm fresh as a rose. - And why do you say that? Because we're going, Carlos. You need it and they too. - But with what? - I've got some savings. If they appoint you Minister of Treasury we would end up loaning dollars to the Americans. Everything is set. Look. Tarragona, residential city. Education for the kids and relax for us. - Look, look an those beautiful houses. - Yes, beautiful, but we've got to eat, and the sea breeze makes you hungry. Everything included: breakfast, lunch, dinner. Three courses: meat, eggs, vegetables. And you know how much it is? 35 pesetas. Seven duros each. Seven duros? It keeps on ringing. Awesome. They have them by pairs. Again. Well, who knows which ones are from this house and which ones aren't. - What about these ones? - Good. But there's something weird. Look. In Latin, Julio César, B plus, and Octavio Augusto, A. And in Math, Octavio Augusto, B minus, and Júlio César, B plus. Mysteries of scholar grading. The total average is B plus and 3 A each. Come on. Be brave. Let's see your grades. - What are you waiting for? - I haven't got them yet. But you do know them? - Yes. - Well say it. And? Well... - I've passed two. - Only two? You'll attend a boarding school the whole summer. You'll be alone. You've gambled with your vacations and you've lost. All of us we'll leave except you. It makes me very sad, but you've asked for it. It's going to be about a month. That is, if we finally leave. - Are you leaving or not? - I don't know... Things. - Is something wrong? - Stuff. - What kind of stuff? - The family, the kids... Don't keep asking. There come my parents. I'll call you later. And I'll tell you. - Good afternoon. - Hello. - Hello. - Hi. So, gone shopping? Yes. Some thingies for the summer vacation. - Did you say for the summer vacation? - Yes. We're leaving tomorrow. - Just both of you? - No. And the kids and grandpa. We're leaving the house empty for a month. - We're going to the sea. - Beautiful. So far away... - See you when we return. - Have a save trip. Thank you very much. Bye. Tomorrow you have to return our tickets. We're staying. The best summer vacation is at home and in peace. Surprise, kids! Attention, ladies and gentleman! Don't worry, there's plenty for everyone. One toy for you, another one for you, another one here, another one for you, one toy for you, another... Come on, what's up? Don't take it as a stand up, dad, but if Carlitos is not going, we don't want to go either. - This is your idea, isn't it? - It's everybody's idea. We've had a general meeting and we've made the decision. A unanimous decision. Isn't that so? - Yes. Everyone. - Yes. You do understand If one is missing, it's different. Let's confer. Now it's the Prime Minister decision. With this troop, you don't know what to expect. - What do you think? - They've given us the solution, because you and I were going to be the ones who'd suffer the most. But they'll have their way. They'll have our way, everybody's way. - And who's going to tell them? - You, naturally. - Me? - It won't affect your authority. They ask for a favour and you grant it. Seeing the voting results, the Presidency changes its ruling. - Kids, you win. - Yeah! - Let's go and see the sea! - The sea! Let's go and see the sea! - Let's go! - Come on! - So big! - So blue! - So clean! - So much water in the streets! I'm sure this can't be good for the rheumatism. This is going to be so boring. - We're going to have a blast. - It's beautiful. - There'll be beautiful girls. - And dances. Look, Chencho. Look how beautiful it is. That's Roger de Lauria, the great admiral. Even the fishes has to ask him to stick their heads out of the water. What a knowledge! He's going to be a scholar. Hey, dad. 360 miles in 10 hours and 15 minutes. Leaving out the stops, the average speed is 35. Yes, son. Exactly. Kids, let's go to the residential city. - Come on! - Let's go! - We're here! - Welcome. - The German group? - No, sir. From Madrid. A small town from La Mancha, understand? You don't need to tell me your name. I've figured it out. Mr. and Mrs. Alonso and family. Expected arrival. Everything in set. Here you have the keys. Houses 14 and 16. - Separate? - Coupled. You don't fit it just one house. - Arrange yourselves as you wish. - Thank you very much. There's two rounds for lunch and dinner. And one for breakfast. Please, follow that path and then turn right. - Very nice of you. - Never mind. Bye. Come on, kids. The safari! My legs are starting to ache. Madrid, should be nearer the sea but they built it right there and that's it. - Hey, look at that! - Hey, you. Up! - For me. - Give it back! Give it to me. - Bye, you guys. - Bye. Be careful with that ball, you may hit the baby. Or the big baby. You fools! Now I have to start again. - This one's blue. - I can only find white ones. - Go to deeper waters, you chickens. - I don't want to. I'm scared. Come on, scary cat. Hey, oars are for rowing. Go to lbiza and come back. You do that. Don't wet the baby. - What are you looking for? - The sea water makes me hungry. Even mineral water makes you hungry. Hey, mom, how would you writer dad a letter? With English handwriting, the one they taught me. - I mean what did you tell him. - Well, I don't remember. But I'm sure I didn't ask no one. I'm doubtful. I don't know if I should say "dear Alberto" or "esteemed Alberto" or "dear friend". Anything except "dear sir". - More water, grandpa. - Now we have to add the almonds. - Chencho play. - Keep Chencho away. - Chencho. Castle. Ugly. - What is he saying? He says the castle is ugly. I see here a small model of Sigüenza's castle. What's he saying about Superman? - Hi. - Hi. Do you want me to hold the mirror for you? No. I'm done. - You know something? - What? I've been wanting to talk to you since you arrived, but you were never alone and I didn't have the courage. I looked at you. - I didn't notice. - We live across the street - In the last house. - Sometimes you stroll down on your bike. - What's your name? - Luisa. - Pretty name. My name is Jorge. - Really? I thought Jorge was just a name for novels. - It's pretty common in Catalonia - What are you reading? Some Biology text. I'm preparing myself. This year I'm going to college. I'm going to be a doctor. - Really? - Yes. Like my father. - And you? Are you studying? - I just finished fifth grade. - Do you know how to ride a bike? - A bit. - We have 2 at my house. - Do you want to go for a ride? - We race in pairs. - With me you're going to loose. It'll be a way to win your heart. Do you want to start eating your food? - No. - Come on, open your mouth. - Chencho. - You'll talk later. Stop it. You're spitting at me. - Yeah, sure, tomorrow. - Chencho. My God. And Sabina is sleeping. Chencho. Don't insist, because without an interpreter, I can't understand. Shut up. Bye, grandpa. I'll be back soon. Great! Everyone living lives and I'm stuck here. Come on, we're almost done. - No. - Come on. - No. - Yeah, son. You don't understand me and I don't understand you. We're even. - Silly grandpa. - Grandpa? Hit grandpa? Silly grandpa. Bye, dad! Bye! - Look! Look! Look! - Wow! It's a scorpion! No way! It's a crab. Scorpions are evil. And how do you know this is good one? - You'll see. I'm going to tame it. - And if it stings you? Crabs don't sting. Ouch! And what was that? A little kissy? - It's nothing. - Attention. Please enter the dining room for the second round. Young men, try not to be so late. One day you'll come for lunch at dinner time. - But the water is so nice... - Control yourselves. One thing is to go swimming and another to try and grow scales on your skin. Look, dad. Julio César says this is a monocotyledon and Octavio Augusto says it's a dicotyledonous. - So what? - Tell us which one is it. Just great. So whenever you have any doubt, your father should solve it. Well I'm not telling you. Study it in your own books. Go on. - Can you believe it? - Is it so hard for you to tell them? Very hard, because I haven't got the slightest idea. The food is here! - Me. - I want salad. - Come on, serve us. - I want a double serving. This family is going to make me a nervous wreck. - I have 12. - And I have 15. - Because you took 3 from mine. - No way. I picked them up. Come on, don't fight over a couple of silly shells. A bug! A horrible bug! Don't be a chicken. His name is Teófilo and I'm taming it. I trade pastrami for sardines. I trade pastrami for green olives. I trade pickles for tuna. Tuna is bad for blood pressure. Pickles are bad for flatulence an look at her. - I offer Russian salad. - I don't want anchovies! Then give them to me. You just woke the baby. Less noise and more eating. Carlos, say something. They wont listen to me. You want me to lecture them. They're not exactly a bunch of scholars. Hey! Everybody, eat and shut up! It shows I'm not a sergeant, doesn't it? Well, well, look who's here. - Family! I'm here. - Don't argue. - Godfather! - Sweets! What a trip! I left yesterday and I've had 5 punctures, a broken exhaust pipe, two melted rods, my lights went out in the road and when everything was smooth I ran out of gas. That's because you're greedy. You should have a decent car. But since you drive an antique piece of trash... Sure, why don't you buy me one? It's about time you buy me something. Just a generous gesture. Don't start. Leave it for tonight, when it's not so hot. Waitress please. One more cover. If 18 people can eat, so can 19. Yes, sir. And 100! And 1000! And tomorrow I'm leaving for Reus! I can't stand it anymore! - I've only got 3 more left. - It's my turn. - Here. - And what's this? Don't touch that. A pocket is life a safe. Dad, the teacher has arrived late. - Well, she'll leave later. - What teacher? - The one who teaches Carlitos. - Every day. This is out of remorse. - A pardon is a pardon. - Then he should have passed. You want your kids to be the wise men of Rome. - Of Greece. - Rome also had it's wise men. I'm going to put and end to this right now. You hear me? - I hear you, but I'm not listening. - Why? - Because I don't feel like arguing. - Well I do. - Then argue with yourself. - You know what I'm going to do? Do whatever you want except ruining my nap. - Okay. Where's that teacher? - Over there. - Over there? - Let's go. Come on. Come on, come! A teacher! Some lizard! With the excuse of giving lessons she earns a free summer vacation. I'm going to kick her in... - And she's going to go... - Where? flying. I'm going to kick her out. Sodium chloride, potassium chloride and ammonium chloride. Sodium iodide, potassium iodide and ammonium iodide. And sodium bromide, potassium bromide and ammonium bromide. Enough with the carbide and the harmonic! So much potions and so much... My God! This is sweeter than my cakes. - Excuse me? - No, nothing. Just that all this is very healthy. Iodides and chlorates and all that. - Come on, kick her. - Shut up, girl. - What is she saying? - This kids always want to play ball. - I mean the lizard. - Shut up. That's that about a lizard? - A male lizard. A male individual. We were thinking about fishing some. I mean, to hunt some. Go on and when you have 10 or 12 you call me. I'm not leaving here. So, is it a very long lesson? - Two hours per day. - So brief? - We don't want the kids to get tired. - Yes, yes. You have a study. You have to learn all those things, maybe one day there's a tragedy and... One hour more. And I'll be here. There's always something new to learn. - Let's see... - Come on, it should be starting now. Lets see the movie because we have "Space War". This is one about rockets. Godfather, chocolate. Godfather is not here and they don't have chocolate here. Come on, if we miss the first part we wont understand the second part. - Hurry. - Chencho, faster. Listen, I can't let all of you in. It's not rated for general public? Yes, sir. Of course it is, but you have to pay. Do you thing that I got those tickets for free? No, sir, but here there's only 7 tickets and there's 10 of you. - Little kids enter for free. - For free? Little kids watch the movie just as adults do. Between all of them they use only 7 seats and here you have to pay per each seat, isn't it so? You want me to pay twice for the same seat. Look, I don't want any problems, so enter and let's forget it. But we've missed the beginning. Tell us about it so we can pick up the plot. Well, look, it turns out that at the beginning of the film, Martians invade Earth. And now they're going to invade Saturn. Has anyone died yet? All of them. Not one has survived. - The good guy? - Of course. It has to be the good guy, because he is good looking, he wears a nice shaves and nice clothes... In this films the bad guy always wear beards or sideburns. Okay, enough. Get inside, because I'm not explaining anything more. - Hurry up. - 10, 9, 8... - Quiet, kids! - 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0. CAPE CANAVERAL Attention, guards! Solid fuel is the most efficient one. Earth Control, the astronaut. Come on, Teófilo. And if the ship doesn't make it into orbit and he falls and dies? - That's why he's got the parachute. - Exactly. You're going to ruin my handkerchief. - Shut up, silly. It'll be okay. - You have to lend your handkerchief to a celebrity like Teófilo. Don't worry, everything is under control. He should land in Area Z. And if the falls in the sea, Juanito is patrolling to rescue him. - No news, grandpa. - There's no spies in sight. We have to prepare the launch mechanism with a remote control. We don't want unnecessary risks. So pretty in French is "Julie", uh? No. "Jolie" - Jolie. - Jolie. And very pretty? I mean very pretty? Here it is. Tres jolie. Only "three"? And four and five and a thousand times jolie. We're not advancing. This is no way of learning French. Each one learns what he needs to know. For example, how do you say... "I like you very much, I want to take you to dance this afternoon?" At this rate, the afternoon will be over by the time you learn that. I'll make it shorter. How do you say..."bonbon". Precisely..."bonbon". Lit the fuse! 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0. I said zero. - Zero my ass! - Drat! The wind put off the fuse. Kids, don't worry. We've failed like them, due to atmospheric conditions. Second test. Hurrah, grandpa. Thanks. That's what I call constructive criticism. Grandpa handsome. Lit the fuse! - Second test ready! - Let's save time. 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0. - We've failed again. - Watch out, grandpa! - It's off! - It's so high! - It's doing weird things. - It's because is entering in orbit. - Bye, crab! - Bye, Teófilo! Et vous ce'st pour moi le plus "dumarran". - What's wrong with you? - I'm about to explode. Gross! Get out, you vermin! I knew Berlin had to end this way. The baby's bottle is ready on the shelf. You only have to heat it up a bit. Yes, mom. I know. If she sleeps, don't wake her up until seven. And don't let the flies bug her. Come on, Mercedes. It's getting late. I'm coming. You really don't mind looking after her? Of course not, mom. You never go out. - Have fun. - And don't be sad. Maybe today you'll hear from your engineer. The mailman hasn't come by yet. Don't worry. I wont cry if there's no letter. From home! Alberto. Look, mom. He's come all the way here. I knew we just couldn't have the afternoon off. See? He's come to answer your letter in person. He loves me, mom. He has to love me if he came all the way here in his motorbike. He's not here to write an article about the town. Go on with him. The poor thing must be exhausted. This sure is fun. Well, pick up the baby's bottle and feed the soprano. Mom, dad, you can leave. - What do you mean? - I know everything. The baby's bottle at 7 or before if she cries. In bailed water, not to hot. And don't worry about the flies. - This is our chance. - Come on, my baby. Poor thing. You're very affectionate, hubby. It's been so long since we last were like this, together and alone. Oh, yeah. The twist. Well, let's get out of here. This can't be healthy. Come on, old man. Let's keep being alone, but more comfortable. This marriage thing is a great invention. It's like a world for 2. Everything else is left outside of it. You know the sun tan works very good for you? I'd say it makes you younger. Are you going to seduce me by now? And even more attractive. Well I find you more handsome than ever. Lately I'm feeling really good. Agile, fit... Actually, I just can't see no one I like better than you. Stop it. I'm going to blush. If you weren't my husband, I'd hunt you down. - With a rifle? - With a cannon. Do you remember when you were my boyfriend? Yes, but then you only had me. Now you have 15 loves and I'm the last one. - Look, Carlos... Look. - What? Look. - They're just a pair of brats. - How old were we when you first took me out to dance? - Those were different times - Our times. Now it's their times. At this rate, I'll stop being the mother of my kids to become the grandmother of your grandsons. What a grandmother! Like the ones of he American films. - The prettiest one in the world. - Mom! Mom, I'm very happy. He loves me. Do you want to meet him? Tomorrow baby. There's no hurry. I'm so happy! You tell dad, okay? There's no need. He can tell. See? What I see that we just keep meeting our kids. Do they all have to come here? It's their place, Carlos. We should leave it to them. Sure. You're right. When the mountain comes down on Muhammad, the best thing he can do is leave. Waiter! Come on! Him too? Have you noticed that being both from Madrid, we've met in Tarragona? It seems predestined. - Such is fate, Juan. - What did you called me? Juan. Isn't that your name? Yes, but since everybody calls me godfather... - Hey, Paula... - What do you want? - I want you! - So suddenly? Suddenly people fall in love and get married... - lf the girl wants. - Aren't you going too fast? No. It's this rhythm. Can you imagine us before the priest? Do you take Paula as your wife? Do you take Juan as your husband? Come on, answer. - Even Juanito! - It's natural, Carlos. Vacations, sea... It's time of love for them. See? They'll soon leave home. Don't think about that yet. Why not? It's a matter of a few years. We're starting to get... Don't say old. We're just grown ups. Even if we still love each other. It's been so long... No, Mercedes. Not so long. Just today, because each day I fall in love with you again. Nothing has gone by. Today we start again. - It's so heavy. - Be careful. Will you come back next year? I don't know. You never know with my family. If you do come back, you'll find me here waiting. - Luisa! - I'm coming, mom! I've been happy this summer, very happy. I'm taking with me great memories of this place and of you, Jorge. I've been happy also. I never knew I could be so happy, but neither I though I could feel so much sadness. I've got to go. - Bye, Jorge. - Bye, Luisa. - Maybe until next year. - Until next year. - Come on, you drag! - You've fallen for good, sis. - Brutes! Rascals! - Poor thing. She's fallen in love. - Very funny! - Don't push! MERRY CHRISTMAS "Today is Christmas Eve and tomorrow is Christmas Day". Hey, what is this? Come on! Wake up! You lazy kids! Come on! Today is the last school day. - One day doesn't matter! - "Bring out the bottle María... - because I'm going to get drunk". "Bring on the fight. Bring it on because today's Christmas Eve". - You need some room? - Never mind. I'll use the other one. - Good morning, dad. - Hi, good morning. Well, well. We should open a pool here. - My God! - Leave the water, Mónica. - Come on, lay the table. - Yes, mom. Baby! It's so cozy in here! Did you know the little one already says mom and dad? - Really? - That's what grandpa says. - Grandpa. - He's got witnesses. - I think soon she'll start walking. - Whereto? Like all the rest, up and down the hallway. Chencho is the one lagging behind a bit. He'll snap out of it. Shepherd in the field. - Watching the sheep. - Are you happy for something? I'm always happy for many things, but today I have a special reason. - Today is a great day. - Pay day. Several pays day. - Good morning. If I may say so. - Yes, it's kind of fresh. You must be from Burgos, where they say cold is fresh. Did you bring my letter? Miss, Postal Service never fails. - Thanks. - She's got it figured out. Tuesdays and Fridays. Love and order don't go together. Next summer seems so far away. I feel like it's never going to arrive. The moment when I'll see you, hear you, be with you. However... However the past is so near. Your wages and your points. With many people like you, taxpayers - would soon be bankrupt. - How many kids do you have? None. I decided to stay single. Well with many people like you, soon we wouldn't have taxpayers nor Spaniards nor nothing. You arrears with all the legal percentages. Well, it seems to me that there's more than... Well, in these cases, the one who pays is always right, but are you sure you're not mistaken? Yes. I've calculated the rations with the time due for your wages and I've added roughly your Christmas bonus. Roughly? This is great! It seems to me that you've been very kind. Well, now I only need to know when do we start working. - At the beginning of the year. - You're thriving here uh? Yes, things are going okay. After the next embargo, I'll have my own house. With so many bankruptcies, you'll end up a millionaire. Thank you very mucho, Mr. José. And Merry Christmas. - Likewise. Thanks a lot. - Bye. I'm horrified, Carlos. Everything is so... Yes, I know. Everything is so expensive. I know the first chapter by heart. It shows you're not the one... It shows you're not the one doing the shopping. Second chapter. - But I'm not meeting the budget. - In Christmas no one meets the budget. Thanks to that we thrive. Mysteries of modern economy. I'll give you a hand Mr. Carlos. I always end up paying for everything. What do you mean? I've just received a "lecturation". Because Mr. Críspulo has done another barbarism. He has ruined all the mailboxes in the entrance. Are you sure it was him? It's a supposition, a very "accusate" one. And that means problems. You go and "lecturate" him. - Why don't you do it? - I've got two construction sites left. - Give up! - Give up! Superman never gives up! We'll corner him with toxic gas! - Not that. You! - Go and get him! - What's going on here? - Help me. - Is the house on fire? - It's the remains of the battle. Superman has been defeated by Rin-tin-tin's band. - Did you bring cookies? - Yes. And get up. You're the most childish. And about you, we'll talk later, Mr. Mailbox. We were playing and playing is sacred. - Stop it! - I'm hungry, mum. Take this, it's very healthy. I'd have taken them to the movies, but I'm out of money. And my retirement payment is not due until tomorrow. Don't tell me about money. I'm desperate. And thank God we save some money in nougats. That's Sweet King's job. Beautiful. They're just beautiful. I never make money with these things, but... - They're so pretty. - But you're making money. With what's left I can make four or five more. - I don't understand. - Sure. Less weight and more decorations. - Then what do you think of this one? - You'll never learn. Less pork loin and more visual items. Why two hams? One and wrapped in tinfoil. - What's a ham? - A hog's leg. No offense. Exactly! Something gross. But wrapped in tinfoil it looks like a jewel. No cans. Four, but well placed. You don't eat the baskets, you watch them. And the receiver contemplates it as a work of art. He looks for the card to see who has send it, He replaces it with his card and sends it to another person. The delivery boys steal the items on the way over. You are smart! Together we can get rich in no time. How can I have lived so many years without you? - What do you think? - Perfect. - That is a real basket. - It's beautiful I just can't figure it out. When one of our kids gets appointed Minister or something, okay. But now, who can send us such a supermarket? - Maybe the godfather went nuts. - No way! The godfather sends lots of nougats and almonds. - There's 3 bottles of whisky! - Four of champagne! - Five! Here's another one. - And two hams. - And a turkey! - No, you silly. - Turkey. - Look what they just sent us. Look at that basket. Who sent such a cathedral? Mercedes says it's from the godfather. - Fool. - No way! - Look how many things it has. - Turkey. - Even one turkey with a tie. - And a bottle of vodka. Vodka? Maybe Khrushchev sent it. Excuse me for the inconvenience. There's been a misunderstanding. The delivery boys made a mistake. - It's for Mr. Beltrán. - I knew there was a glitch. So if you don't think it's a brag, - I must give it to him. - And even if we thought so. You take it and that's it. As you may infer, for me it's just the same. That is, I don't mind. But I have to take it over to him. - Yeah. - And the turkey. Hey, hey. This turkey is mine and only mine. Thin, but honest. - Excuse me. It's been a... - Yes, a misunderstanding. But if I'm not quick, I loose the turkey. - Here. For everybody. - Is it plastic? I wish. We could blow it up then. Rickety, meagre, but it's a turkey. There'll only be a bit for each, but it's a turkey. The extra cash. Yes, I know it's a drop in the sea. But the sea is made out of drops. Dad, this is for your expenses. I don't have expenses. I feed on the air. Críspulo! They're new. Give them back to me! Don't start. Bring the bag here. Don't touch the Superman comics. Hey! Give me one at least. What a day! With the Christmas bonus, the kids and the doorman. Mom, I was so anxious to get here. Look. - Is it raining money? - What's this? The first money I've earned. I've been working in the Cement Institute. You know with whom? With the teacher who flunked me. He said they were useful works. And that they deserved a reward. I thought it could help, even if it's not much. Well, here it is. See? It's the first money they've earned. There's another man in this house. Yes, mother. But don't cry. I feel these are going to be the best Christmas in our lives. Bell after bell, and then one more bell. Look out of the window, you will see the baby boy in the cradle. Bethlehem, bells of Bethlehem. Bells the angels are ringing. What news are you bringing us? - I've brought you your flock. - Look, Chencho! When are we sending our letters to the Wise Men? Now we'll go and see King Melchior. - Buy me a star. - We'll make one with tinfoil. - Buy a little donkey. - We have one. - It's one leg short! - And the ox's head is missing. - Mónica broke it last year. - Sure. Always touching everything. You don't respect anything. It's always the same. Bells the angels are ringing. What news are you bringing us? Bell after bell, and then two more bells. Look out of that window, because the son of God is just right there. Stop it, kid! Come on, get out of here! Antonio, would you give me a hand here? Look up the logarithm for 62.5. You can feed her now. - It's that clock on time? - Surprisingly it is. They are running too late. There are lots of people in the streets. I came back walking. The subway was packed. - Where can those kids be? - With the big kid. They'll want to see everything. Do you have it? Yes, dad. - Chencho! - Chencho! - Chencho! Chencho! - Where are you, son? - Chencho! - Where are you? - Chencho, answer me! - Chencho, son! - Chencho! - Chencho, my baby! Come here. Don't split. Let's keep together. We have to find Chencho. Please, lady. Have you seen a little kid alone and kind of lost? I told you I hadn't. Go and look on the other side. - We just came from there. - Thank you, lady. - And he wasn't there. - Come on. Let's go, boys. - Chencho! Chencho! - Chencho! Where are you? - Well, it's about time. - Mom! Mom! - The little kid... - Mom, we've lost Chencho. - Lost? Where? - There, by the Christmas crèche. - I lost him. - Carlos! Carlos, they've lost Chencho! What? How can he get lost? He'll be around there, with Eulogio. The poor thing is so dissolute. And you're out of this world! It's my fault for letting them go out with you! They don't have common sense and you don't even know the meaning. You're right, girl. I'm just a useless poor old man. Poor thing! My little poor kid! Someone will bring him over. Calm down. I'm sure nothing's happened to him. Come on. You must be brave. You've always been brave. They rely on us. Come on! Calm down! On to Bethlehem, shepherds. On to Bethlehem, kids. For here is the king of the sweets... What's going on? - Chencho's lost. - What? - When? - This afternoon. We were watching the Christmas crèche. - Suddenly he disappeared. - We have to do something. We can't just sit here. We must act now. - What can we do? - Turn the world upside down. I never knew how it's done, though. First the police. We've got to call 911. - Do you think the police? - I'll call. Wow! The police! - Let me go look for him. - I'm going too. No. You stay here in case somebody calls. Look after your brothers and grandpa. Come on. - Yes. - Hello, this is the Police. Yes. Two years old. At the Plaza Mayor? What? Chencho? Attention! Attention! Z-10. A two-year-old boy just got lost at the Plaza Mayor. He answers to the name of Chencho. Over. Z-10, we copy. Over. Come on. Attention, The Voice of Madrid Urgency Service. This afternoon, around nine in the afternoon, a two-year-old boy got lost. His name is Chencho. - What does Chencho mean? - Gaudencio. These godfathers... What does he look like? He's a normal kid. Blonde, blue eyes... He barely blinks. It's one of his rareness. He barely cries. On the contrary. He laughs at everything. And he sounds confusing. Not that he can't speak well. It's just that he goes too fast. He's a bit tall for his age. When he stops or when he's distracted, he turns his right foot inwards. - It's another rareness. - What was he wearing? Green sweater. Wool pants. Light gray coat with decorations in leather. And a black cap. A photo would be useful. We could publish it in tomorrow's newspapers. Look. No, it's not too clear. It's just a kid and nothing more. And nothing less! Hello? Yes, dad. Nothing. Nothing yet. We've alerted the night watchman. And mom? Take good care of her. He's the only one who counts now. Call once in a while in case there's any news. - Grandpa, drink this. - I can't swallow, honey. Try. We don't want you to be ill. Eat some cookies. Grandpa. Do you still have the letters for the Wise Men? I don't know, son. Look in my coat. Come on. Let's go. I told you it was useless to come here. - Who knows. - Maybe... The police have been here. Hey, good man. Have you seen by any chance a small boy alone? Thousands come here. Thousands. But not this late. - This one got lost tonight. - Maybe you've heard something. They always get lost. They call them out, some turn up. And some don't. They're so many. Who knows. But don't worry about that. It's not the end of the world. If they don't drop the atomic bomb on us... - You start pretty early. - And we'll end up late. There's only one Christmas Eve. We'll have some teas, please. - With liquor, so we can get going. - Yes, sir. Where are you celebrating Christmas Eve? With the family. The proper thing today is to gather all at home. Of course. And if we don't see him again? Don't say that. Someone will find him. And tonight we'll have him at home. You'll see. Spain's National Radio, late night show. The boy who got lost at the Plaza Mayor is still missing. Anyone who hears this message and has information on the boy please give immediately every detail you may know. Let's go, let's go, let's go... Poor thing. Where can he be? In this cold weather all night long. Let's go, let's stir up trouble, let's go, let's go... He's slept the whole night through. Look at him. And how he ate dinner. Such an appetite! He looks like an angel. - Don't even think to put on the radio. - No way. Maybe they won't say anything. Just in case. If you don't hear anything and you don't see anything... And when they bring the paper, don't read it. Tomorrow there's no paper. No one will know it. We haven't been able to sleep all night - thinking about the little baby. - Besides, with this quietness... Thanks for your concern. - It's natural among neighbours. - I wish we could do something. Dad, it was your boss asking if he could help. Why didn't you call me? I would've come right away. I can imagine what you've been through. This is time when we should be together. - For Miss Luisa. - For me? Cold or hot, winter or summer, your faithful servant brings your mail by hand. Except for the two pound packages, which you have to pick up. Well, all that about sadness and joy. - And merry Christmas. Thanks. - Thank you. Here. SO YOU'LL ALWAYS REMEMBER OUR FIRST CHRISTMAS Stories! News! Bulletins! We'll have the city on its toes. You interviewed us when we won the price. But besides interviews, us journalists do much more. - Which one is missing? - The little one. The smallest one. The one with the pacifier. The one who grabbed my pencil. We have to find him no matter what. We'll give it all we've got. You can count on me, the paper and all my workmates. - We'll surely appreciate it. - Dad, this man is from the police I have bad but relieving news. Neither in hospitals nor first aid centres or private clinics has any kid been admitted. And where can he be? Probably with a family with no radio. Or that doesn't listen to it. We'll get the news to them. Everyone we'll hear from us. I tell you. We'll use all the papers in Madrid. If someone asks, say I'm running an errand. - Where are you going? - That's my problem. Two columns. In bold letters and framed if possible. Hey, kid, don't skip the cue. Who do you think you are? Get out. This one is urgent. Are you in such a hurry to ask for your toys? I don't want any toys. Well, this year. Look, your Majesty, I was asking for a space helmet, a laser gun, a nuclear submarine and a bike. I ask for the bike each year, but it never comes. Your Majesty, everything is blotted. Don't pay any attention to the blots. - They always come. The rest, out. - What are you asking for then? It's written, but I've come in person in case you don't get it. - You see God, don't you? - Yeah, sure. Well tell him I just want my little brother to show up. He got lost yesterday. He's the little one. Mum is crying and I've never seen her cry. Tell that to God. Well, he knows. He must hurry up. He has to show up so we can all be together. Today is Christmas Eve. Will you tell him, your Majesty? I'll tell him. And tell him also that I'll be good. I won't ruin the elevator or the door rings. I won't steal grandpa's comic books. And, most of all, I won't skip school. - I'll tell him everything. - What a relief. - And don't forget it, your Majesty. - No. What did he say? If I saw God. I've seen Him in his eyes. - Everything is fixed. - What's fixed? Chencho's problem. I've fixed it. - What have you done? - Something. There's no way to follow this kid. Mom, stop crying. There's no need now. Dad, I've told grandpa. You'll see, tonight Chencho will have dinner with us. - May God listen to you. - Of course he'll listen to me. Good morning. I've come to see what I can do. I just heard. No news from the kid? Nothing. It's in the papers and they keep announcing it on the radio. Lately we don't listen to it. - With TV... - Sure. What? What did you just say? Say it again. I don't know. Did I say anything inconvenient? - No. - On the contrary. Convenient. It could be convenient you don't listen to the radio - but you watch TV. - Exactly. SILENCE - Hi. - Hey, where are you going? - It's an urgent matter. - Okay, but I have to call it in. This is no use! The cast is incomplete. Then I'm the one held responsible. They should know by now that they have to be on time. - Hey, please... - It's about time! - Come on! Now! - No, no. I didn't... For God's sake. Don't you have any sense of time? No excuses, come on. The beard! Come on, the lamb! If you can't remember your lines, you'll hear from me! - What lines? Hey! - Come on! - Everyone to the set. Come on. - No, I'm not... I'm not... Shut up! Come on! Music in! Come on, don't stop. Go with the others. What is this guy doing? And look at that beard! Now you'll let the lamb loose! Get this lamb out of here? Here. - I don't want any lamb. - Why are you dressed like that? - And with that animal. - How should I know. This guy is trying to get me in a Christmas crèche. - Why don't you explain it to him? - You do it. He won't listen to me. Me? I can't get this thing off and it stinks. - Do you like it? - Yes? - Cookie. Yummy. Boy. Cookie. - Do you like it? Chencho like. Chencho. Me. Chencho like. Chencho. - What does Chencho mean? - Who knows. Lorenzo? Inocencio? Chencho. Cute. Dada. - She's so cute. - And so nice. Ladies and gentlemen, Spanish Television has been asked to collaborate in an special case whose human interest is even bigger due to the date we're in. We bring to our screen an appalled marriage, parents of a numerous family, a great family, whose youngest child got lost yesterday night. We lost him. He is still so small. - Dad, mom. - We're desperate. Dad. Mom. Ma. Mom. Ma. Dad. We ask. We beg. So you see. Godfather, Chencho here. He can barely speak. Nor can I. If someone knows where our Chencho is, - please, call us. - Godfather. His parents and me also, I'm the godfather, all his brothers and grandpa... Well, we've many asking for it. - Dad. Mom. - Dad and mom. Damned TV! Why did we put it on? Dad. Mom. Dad! Mom! Dad! Mom! Dad. Mom. - They're over there. - There they are. - A picture, please. - Just a moment, please. Move right. Thank you very much. I know we did wrong, but he seemed so alone. He smiled at us and stretched his little hands. It was as he had fell from heaven. I know it's impossible, but you would make us so happy if you leave him here. You have so many and we're so alone. - He would have everything. - Yes, I understand, but he must be with us, with his family. I know they're lots of brothers, but that's just why they've got to be together. All of them. We would give him everything a boy can dream of. - He would have a better care. - Yes. Maybe. But it's not a matter of better or worse care, but a matter of being where he belongs, at home. Come, Chencho, come here. Come on. - Say something for TV. - No. - For your brothers, grandpa... - Come on, kid. - Say "I showed up". - Sorry. Just a moment. Chencho has showed up. Come on. They're watching you. - Chencho, Chencho. - Chencho, Chencho. Come on. This is for the kid who has become famous. Wow! Dad! Mom! Grandpa! Godfather! Kids! Come here! Wow! Wow! This is awesome. Get out. Look. Instead of asking for a ransom, they give you the boy back and they even buy you a TV set. You're one lucky family. No, we're a family with a fantastic godfather. - I didn't expect this from you. - No, Carlos, you're wrong. I didn't send over this thing. Dream on. "So Chencho can still have the TV set in which he saw his parents". - Hurrah! - Hurrah! Hey, this is heavy. Where should he put it? Wherever is fits. Not an easy task in this house. - There, in the dining room. - We'll tune it in no time. How much power do you have here? 220 or 110? Sometimes more, sometimes less. And when he have black outs, none. Merry Christmas, Jorge. Thanks for thinking about me. I think a lot about you too. No. Of course I'm not seeing another man. I promise. Yes. We'll all be at home, all together. Come on, come on. Carlos, I don't know how, but we have to make some room. - What? - Number 16 is on his way. - You're kidding! - No. And we won't name him after the saint of the day. His name will be Jesús, as a reminder of this Christmas Eve. Mercedes! I can see some lines! Look, Chencho! I can see some lines! You see how pretty it is? Look. I can see some lines. I can see some lines, Chencho! THANK YOU GOD Hallelujah. Hallelujah. THE END
