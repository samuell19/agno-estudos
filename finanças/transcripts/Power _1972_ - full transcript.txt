"THE POWER" "ORIGIN OF POWER" "THE STONE AGE" "LIFE WAS ROUGH, FOOD WAS SCARCE, AND THE TIMES WERE UNCERTAIN" (intense panting) T-the...ch...chic...chicken.... ...God of the fire... Fire... God of the fire! They are frightened... I am friend with the fire! I have the power to dominate the fire... But! The fire needs to eat... Ye shall bring me one chicken a day, and sometimes even a pig Woe unto you! If you don't comply Woe unto you... I, Muhammed, have the power to communicate with Allah Allah is your God, and I speak in his inspiration Allah requieres offerings, sacrifice the lamb and the goat But woe unto you! If you eat the flesh of the pig... Woe! Woe to you, if you eat meat on Fridays Woe to you, if you use the pill! "The Roman Age" Military, commercial and agrarian power The war against Carthage has provided us with plentiful fortunes, and a myriad of slaves Yes, but these slaves eat and don't work, we need to find a way to exploit them... Let's send them to the fields, farming has its costs Brilliant idea...but! - The plebeian tribunes will oppose -Yet, only one needs to be paid off -It’s more likely that the farmers will revolt -We will push back any uprising We have a strong army, more than capable to defend the nation Ave, Tiberius, ave! O' tribune of the people, Tiberius When we fought against Anibal, the nobility promised us fortunes and wellness And now, they kick us out of the farms, replacing us with slaves We no longer have our cows, bread, oil... -We only eat from the grass -Like beasts For months, I have been planning an agrarian reform I will ask for the public lands, owned by the lords, to be handed over to the farmers May the Gods protect you, O' tribune of the people The fight will be hard But with the help of my friend "Ser Agapitus" we will win against the hostility of the consuls and the Senate Ave Marcius! Oh, the people these days! Regrettably, the plebs only care about politics this day and age! Have you heard the proposal of tribune Tiberius? It is the end of agriculture, an outright disaster Yes, come forward...forward, death! Death! Ave... Lions! More milk, slave! Father, this milk doesn't have any fat! I wouldn't call this donkey milk Slave, it is required a better control over my donkeys Maybe, your slaves skim your milk, and make butter! If I find one, I'll have it killed by torture! Ave, Ser Agapitus! Are the reports wrong, or are you proposing a law to take away our lands? Oh, no! What am I hearing? It's just an idea from my colleague Tiberius Eh, tribune...if we keep this up, we'll end up cleaning our own backs, with dirty water nonetheless! Such frighten, my dears, do not worry No one will take away your lands. Or your slaves! I don't like this Tiberius fella, he is a buffoon, a revolutionary! He is turning the farmers against us! Fortunately...the other tribune is a true democrat! Of course! I, too, am a tribune of the people, but I shall never enable a law against liberty and right! Now THIS is a proper speech! Knock it off already with this "tribune of the people" nonsense Naive...I do this, for your sake! If you keep Tiberius at bay, I shall gift you with this slave Her skin, as soft as a rose petal And if you support the good and democratic ideas, we patricians shall be on you side as well And we can gift you fortunes For your people, but be wary! Do not lose your autonomy I propose that the lands of the state, occupied and exploited by the landlords, be given to the farmers Bravo! Finally! This way we can eat something! The constitution is offended, I protest and vote against! You traitor! Miserable wretch! Why, Ser Agapitus, don't you act for the good of the people, and the salvation of Rome? I, too, desire the salvation of Rome, but my opinions and my way to achieve said goals are different I have the right to use my vote against your proposal! Citizens, a tribune of the people that acts against the people... Deserves to lose his position Away! Away, Ser Agapitus, traitor! Away! The agrarian reform must be abolished! All it takes is the elimination of Tiberius Gracchus Of course... But if you want to better disorient the plebs, and to give a legal perspective to this assassination It's best if we have the Senate to make an intervention Nobile "patres coscripti", the tribune of the people Tiberius is driving us towards the madhouse To the madhouse, he takes us directly by our behinds In conclusion, what does this Gracchus want? -He wants our lands! -And what shall we eat? Stones? Fools You act witty as Tiberius plans to ruin you! You're right! He's right! -We live out of income! -Gracchus is a madman! What's on your mind, senator? Oh, noblemen, noble senators, why such agitation? Why all this fear for Tiberius Gracchus? Let him croak*, he will not be the one to deject Rome *(a wordplay on his last name, Gracchiare/Gracchus) Let's not take confidence, you never know the outcome! He wants to give the land to the farmers... Alright, alright. But it's in our interest not to exacerbate the plebeians What if we gave them a tiny lil'bit? -I won't give them anything -It’s a matter of principle! The right of property! You give them one finger...they'll ask for the whole arm! Death to Tiberius...! Tribune dead...delayed reform... And you? What do you think, Simplicius? Senators! Let's fulfill our duty! Let's break the bundles! Escape! Save yourself, Tiberius! The senators went mad! They are infuriated They're here to kill you! I am a tribune of the people Why run? Take care of my child... Go! "The Epic of the Far West" "When the power of the conquerors had to become an absolute, and they, the only masters of the land" The moan of the last bison... The earth cries Look at us... We are poor The government from Washington does not keep its promises And sells without any right, our most fertile soils The whites ravage our land And they kill the animals During the marches, we can't find animals, or wood, or water Disease is rampant, and medicine is lacking They push us towards the desert, where it's coldest We are forced to rob, because the invaders deny us mercy and the right to live Look at us... We have a head and a face like you do We are all part of one populace These savages threaten the cattle! They obstruct with commerce and business, and they interfere the construction of the railroad Let's make them slaves, it wou- Impossible! The Indians are not as meek as the Negroes! Then…let's destroy them! Provoking them, in front of the world, would turn the responsibility towards them We will instigate the colonizers, the pioneers against them! We shall violate them with our troops! We shall send our convicts Having them imprisoned is expensive, and there is much free space towards the West... Drop the anchors, and break the prisoners free from the chains! Dear prisoners, ye are now free... In the New World, you shall find peace and you will rebuild your once broken homes Rich mines await you! Fat cattle and fertile, virgin soils that will reproduce your seeds a thousandfold You miserable fucks will become the ancestors of the millionaires of tomorrow Go forth, and colonize! America will become your nation and your logical outlet Go! Pioneer friends, we sell everything! Rifles, shoes, brassieres... Pistols, ammo, gunpowder and more! That's the collection center for pioneers We also sell whiskey, liquors, hard drugs to resell to the indians, in conclusion, a bit of everything! Salutations, pioneers! Come closer, come forward and intertwine with us, because here we are all family, we are all brothers Good morning y'all, hello! How is everyone? I am very honored to salute the blossoming of Europe With your sacrifice, with your courage, you shall bring progress, freedom- -And religion! -And religion…into the new world! "O' merciful God, we turn our pitiful eyes to the sky, and your holy benevolence saves us in the glory of your Kingdom..." But in order to build a healthy and civilized country, we need to get rid of the savages -Holy words -And to suppress them, you need firepower! -…Right! -Bravo! -We need guns, we want gold! -Our lands! Calm down, calm down! You will get everything, here... This is the Winchester, a jewel of the American gun industry -Extraordinary… -Look! Fully automatic! Sixty hits per minute! I will kill 10, 20... 50 indians The railroad will pass through here, and the workers will need meat every day! With this rifle, you can kill hundreds of bison! And make yourselves rich... -All the bison are held in the indian reserves! -We risk our lives! I assure you this, I was told yesterday by a prominent figure in the government... ... That soldiers will be dispatched very soon to protect you! May the protection of the Heavens destroy the indians, and let us capture the bison, amen and so be it, in the name of the Lord If God is with us, who shall be against us? And for the most relentless red skinned dogs, this rifle, sixty dead indians per minute And whoever buys a rifle, I shall gift them a brand-new bible! Because, a bible and a musket make the perfect pioneer! The government has decided to establish agricultural colonies on your land Are the lands of the sunrise not enough? In my youth I have traversed them, and I remember they are beautiful Maybe they have become sterile? The government has decided to construct the railways in your lands The last treaty grants us with this land The government orders you, to sell your pastures and your forests You have always despised the accords, and you've destroyed our villages We forgot, and we gave you the land that was given to everyone But why?... Why do you want to take away this last fraction that barely helps us survive? The government will give you a reserve In your reserves our children go without meat, while you whites kill the bison and take only its tongue Stop it! The white boss sends you to take away our lands! But your colonizers and your soldiers robbed us before we made any deals! I shall speak no more! Threatened by violence, we shall defend this land with our sacrifice! Father, hundreds of palefaces march toward us with wicked cannons... Cannons, of the hundred blows... "Mother..." "We are about to die. Remove from our good people every fear, not for us, but for those that will remain..." It's skinny...so skinny... I can only give you one dollar -But you sell them for five dollars… -We have taxes and expenses to pay! And I'm full of chickens, come on... We can no longer live out of the land Uneducated...crude... “Bigger pays for the laborers” “Sharecropping doesn’t yield, the land to the farmers!” -Hey, Castaldo! -Yes, sir! -What is going on? -The farmers are on general strike, count Someone is turning them into hotheads... 5 dollars... 5 dollars for this bone of a chicken... With your income, we won't be able to eat "Stop to the underfed payments" They all want a raise, boss... Too much anarchy...too much freedom! This is the socialist's fault Socialist partners... We have another goal, to create unions To avoid the speculation on the alimentary products, and to stop the continuous raising of the prices! "SOCIALIST UNION" Place it on this hook, here "CHICKEN $3 That's alright These damn unions, and socialists... -It's a disgrace, the government should intervene -What government? Here, everything is a joke The "reds" are king! Good morning, I have a beautiful chicken, would you like it? With these unions around, we should close shop! I pay taxes! I am a fighter, I didn't fight the war for the "reds" to screw me over How dare you?! You dishonest- Thief! -Shame on you! Attacking a soldier… -The people lack patriotism! Let's hope, let's hope we don't get a revolution! My lands are in danger! Soldiers are insulted and beaten! They want to divide the fields! The socialists want to be kings! Or Rome, or Moscow! Down to the red syndicates! Down to the socialist union, and long live the army! Order! Order! Order! Order! Order! Order! Order! Order! (fascists chant in the distance) SIlence! Stop, stop it! -Who are you? -I’m unemployed Fuck it, let's get down... This is what the strikes give us! -To unemployment! -Right! -But he will now help us to reinstate the order! -Let’s hope… You understand? No farmers, no food -Which party do you support? -None -Good answer! -He is a free man! Good, you are a gentleman, I shall name you leader of the gang He will be one of us, give him the black shirt, c'mon! -Capital and work -Every social class united to defend the nation Let's embark on our journey, let's go! Slowly, dont push -Let’s do this expedition -And punish the reds! "The Head of the Fascists, was a certain Mussolini..." "He considered himself a Roman Duce, and a lord of the Renaissance" "The Queen herself observed, that he was also good-looking, with a vast and sharp sight..." "His big black, wide-open eyes fascinate and dominate..." "His forehead, always looking up..." "His squared outlines, reveal his will..." "Inside him, there is the aristocracy of the genius, and of the blood..." "No one is above him, in the world of the living..." The workers are still strong... The farmland is going bad as well The national spirit is nowhere to be seen... If these socialist ideals take hold... we won't be able to speculate any longer... Let's have the army intervene... We execute the hotheads, and in eight days, we regain control... To justify the violence, we shall take advantage of the confusion of that moment We need to pull the bourgeois on our side... The merchants, the intellectuals... -And also the workers -The agrarian workers! And the fighters, we need to defend the nation! We shall reinforce...the fascist squads! Money for Mussolini... "Circle of the Industrial and Commercial Interests of Milan" Comrades, we thank the industrial and commercial lords for giving us this beautiful room Our programme is simple, we want to govern Italy! Only one thing is encouraging, the hatred towards socialism! "Death to socialism, long live fascism!" We shall swear, that the struggle waged will only end in triumphal victory! I give the word to Benito Mussolini... You the town dwellers, the dominant class, are rightfully preoccupied by your interests You, agrarian! You need my help You, industrial, need my help. Everyone needs my help! You are in need, for the agrarian workers to remain calm! We prefer those that work hard, with determination and possibly, in silence! If you, town dwellers, want to keep your status as the dominant class... Then you have to make a national policy! -Long live the king… -The Republic is better! -Long live the king! -The Republic is better! Long live the King, long live Italy and long live the Nation! -Long live the Republic! -Enough, stop it! Silence! Mussolini, what should we do? The Nationalist ideology will help us maneuver the masses towards our goals Fortify then, the Monarchy. Sacred, glorious, traditional, millenary symbol of the nation The property is a currency, stitched together by hard work! And everyone has the holy right to transmit this right for the ones born after ourselves "NATION. FAMILY. GOD." What about religion? For religion, I already have my plan set I confirm, that the only universal idea is the one spoken by the Vatican Bravo, Mussolini! We will beat down the reds, we will eliminate every single one. We will stop the failures! -We need to burn down the unions -That won’t work… The need to occupy the farm lands! Our actions will always be successful! Death to the Reds! Death to the Reds! We need to burn down the unions! If we ever took a beating, it was because we were outnumbered! They shall not break us! That's why today we build the fascio* (*strongly held bundle of sticks) Even if we join forces, we are still outnumbered by the farmers and the workers! You, agrarian and industrialists have automobiles and telephones While the workers only have bicycles! Our squads will be mobilized throughout, we will always be one hundred against one!

Eleonora! I'm coming, my love! Eleonora! Eleonora! That Mussolini is a hothead, but...he works quite well... Let's conclude...do we give him the power or not? Will the King...be happy? Of course...this also benefits himself... I wouldn't want Mussolini to take advantage of us, once he takes the position of power -We need to take this risk! -Keep working with the populists and socialists… It's too risky for our affairs... What if we supported the liberals and the democrats? The liberals and the democrats are good people, but they are incapable of taking the matter to the squares And the revolutionaries fight on these squares! And so...let's send Mussolini to Rome! ...To Rome! Halt! Break formation Where are we? Do you have the compass? So...the sea is that way... The mountains over there, and the river over here... No, no, no...that's the sea, the mountains are that way and the river is over there -But…that’s what I said -I don’t think so What now? The North is here! We need a map!

Duce, the parliamentarians speak badly of you I respect the Parliament! But if the Parliament is against me, I will destroy the Parliament Long live the Duce! Duce, the workers and the farmers are protesting against their patrons I defend the workers But if the workers disturb the patrons, I will beat down the workers! Your Majesty, the King, is complaining We fascists have protected the interests of the King! In consequence, "Sciaboletta"* must bear with it! (Sciaboletta: Little sword, an insult to the King's small height) Long live the Duce! Duce, the Pope awaits you! I forgot! Good... Good... -How much do we have to pay? -Two billion Quickly, the money! Is it adding up? There's a million and a half missing... Give them the rest! One must be fair when dealing with finances Here it is -I think we can sign now -Alright Benito!~ Get out, it's cold!~ My body is trained for every sport Thank you Dear~ As I remember this beautiful day, you should gift me something to remind me of your love~ -Maybe a wild flower -Degenerate romantic!

We could obtain manufacturing contracts for bronze, steel...and even textiles... Contracts for the construction of streets... We will fund a great empire! By the merits of fascism, our army has become the strongest one in the world Magnificient.. And the most disciplined as well... -When do they start? -I don’t know There's the infantry! -Look at their beauty! -They are tough soldiers indeed Alright, hurry, take off your hats Now dress them as Alpine folk Good...

"MODERN TIMES" These days... These puppets are not helping us anymore Even the word "patriotism" has lost its effect We need to change tactics Let's give the power to the military! Not yet... We need to continue to take advantage and to speculate, under the wings of the Parliamentarian movement Taking profit from the Democratic laws! We will narcotize the masses with the press, with the false culture, with the television! -We shall distract them with sports! -We will calm them with consumer goods... We shall favor the aristocracy of the workers! I'm very honored, your Excellence!

The only problem is the over-abundance! We can't even sell all of these chickens Everything is automatic. This is the food, and this is where the eggs are stored The drinking water, all automatic, it's wonderful. We have a bathroom and a TV for the employee Everything! Because today, the employees want well-being, your Majesty! In our last working site, 7 out of 12 employees own an automobile! Very good! Thanks to Democracy, employees have well-being, jobs and liberty One time, the tides were on our favor, now it is only just that it benefits them as well...

And this, look at this wonder, it's the Super Egg! More than a hundred grams! It's crystal clear! Pretty, very pretty! Congratulations, I was skeptical at first... According to the last medical congress, the egg, because of its ease of digestion and it's proteins and vitamins, and it's lack of toxins... ... It's the ideal food for both young and old! Good! Excellent! Better than the countryside eggs Homo sine pecunia est imago mortis (A man without wealth is the image of death) But today, the great Roman orator would have said... A man without an automobile is the image of death Sacrifice your salary, get into deep debt, sign bills But woe unto you! If you don't buy the last super-light sports model Reduce our working hours! That's fair... I understand your demands...because I'm a true Democrat... To achieve an agreement, and to satisfy your needs, I have bought a new attacking midfielder for your team!

What do you mean? It's the Monblon -What does it do? -I don’t know, nothing. But it’s fashionable -That’s why you bought it? -It only costs five bucks, and $20 if you buy five -Today everyone has it! We can’t not have it! -Stupidity… You are always building luxury homes, while you never address the problem of the housing projects You're right! They're right...and I will always fight for my workers to have decent homes -We can find decent housings, there are plenty of them -But you need half of your salary to pay the fees! But why do you take it on me? I always defend your interests, you're talking to a socialist The houses of the laborers are inhabitable -There is no water! -And no toilets! The government has set apart another 500 billion for the construction of housing for the workers! -What else do you want? -Furthermore, the counties will organize and select the right locations "HOUSING PROJECT" The construction investments in the residential area have given me a net worth of many billions A billion of eggs, for two and a half dollars each, without the manufacturing costs, will give me several billions The sell of the Moblon, without the advertising costs of newspapers, radio and television, has given me a fortune The sell of the Super-Light Sport Special has given me incredible profits... Even from the industry, billions... Strengthen the fabrication of automobiles Less hospitals, less schools and more highways! -There are no more limitations... -The workers want everything now! Commitment is always dangerous! Only strong military power will reinstate order! This will be the last card drawn... But today, to keep the power, it's best if we camouflage ourselves as socialists... "... Who doesn't know, in these days, that every villain loves to strut in a red attire?" -Lenin
