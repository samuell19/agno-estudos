BASED ON WEBCOMIC OKSU STATION GHOST BY HORANG Got here just in time for the last train. It's so late that this place is deserted. What's up with that girl? This is why you shouldn't go overboard with alcohol. It's like she's dancing. That's hilarious. I'M AT OKSU STATION, AND A DRUNK GIRL IS STUMBLING, ALMOST HEADBANGING IS SHE PRETTY? I'll just take one picture. She hit her head. What? She's bleeding. Is she okay? THIS IS SCARY SHE'S BLEEDING, STAGGERING AROUND CALL 911. JUST CALL THE STATION OFFICE. MIND YOUR BUSINESS, GET OUT HOW CAN HE GET HOME THEN? HIS PHOTO LOOKS SO WEIRD IT LOOKS LIKE A GHOST PHOTO SHE'S NOT A GHOST, BUT A BLOODY HAND IS PULLING HER HEAD Why are they blabbering about a ghost? No way. Where did she go? What's that? The train headed to Gupabal is now approaching. THE GHOST STATION A MONTH AGO So you're saying that this person is a man? I didn't know. Who would mistake her for a man? The gender of this person isn't the issue at hand. The problem is the fact that you outed him without consent. I can assure you that I got his consent. Hello, I'm Kim Na-young from Daily Modu. Could I take some pictures and use them in an article? You're perfect for our "Summer It Girl." Thank you! The victim was drunk at the time. You can't call that consent, can you? You post fluff articles on social media and fake stories for some loose change. What would kids nowadays learn from that? What did you say? Please calm down. You can apologize and post a correction as usual, but what about the settlement? Settlement? How much would that be? - Fifty million won? - Yes. That's a lot of money, isn't it? Yes. Have you met the accuser? No, not yet. Why not? I don't have his number. How could a reporter not have her subject's number? I'm sorry. Is your family loaded? Pardon? Do you have money to settle? But my editor confirmed that article. So? Why should I pay... It was an unconsented photo. I did get his consent. Do you have proof? A recording or a consent form? Who takes the fall if one publishes an article based on false information? The writer. Have you read your contract? - Ms. Mo... - If I were you, I'd beg the accuser to retract the lawsuit or find scoops that'll get us more ads. You still don't get it, do you? It's your mess, so you clean it up. Hey, Choi Woo-won. Hi, Na-young. What happened? You said she was a girl, but she turned out to be a guy! What are you saying? The Summer It Girl I took photos of. They say she's a guy! - A guy? - Yeah! She was a guy. I was so sure she was a girl. That's my whole point. - Do you have his contact info? - What for? He reported me to the Press Arbitration Commission. He's going to sue me if I don't give him 50 million won. - Fifty million? - That's right. - So do you have it or not? - I don't have it. And as for that day, I only called you because you asked me for scoops. No? You're right, I did. But why did she have to be a guy? Anyway, if you ever see him again, keep him here and call me, got it? What will you do? I have to find new stories. Something that'll get a lot of clicks and bring in tons of ads. What am I saying? I didn't become a reporter to do this. My life has been a string of unfortunate incidents. Nothing's ever easy. At least you got a decent job and a home. My dad lent it to me, it's not free. I'll have to pay him back. Right, Na-young. Someone died at our station last night. What about that? I actually saw it on the news. The closed underground platform in Oksu Sation seemed worthwhile, so I mentioned it to my editor. But he said suicides are morbid and didn't want it. Na-young. There's more to it than just suicide. Hey. Stop. Why? Jeez, I don't even want to think about it. Why don't you tell her yourself? You witnessed it yourself. Witness what? Good evening, sir. What brings you here? Are you bored? Sir. Yeah? There's a man on the closed platform. Really? CLOSED PLATFORM What the hell? Shit, why is this acting up? Woo-won, could you go check it out? A deadhead train is en route, and he might get into an accident. Yes, sir! Sir! It's dangerous, please come up! What's that? - There was a child? - Yeah. Are you sure? I'm sure. Na-young, could this be the start of the Oksu Station ghost story? Well, I don't know. It's too weak. It could if there was someone else who saw the child. But him alone won't be enough to cut it. The embalmer saw him too. The embalmer? What's that? You must be really into shamanism. My father exhibited great spiritual connection. He should've been a shaman, but he didn't walk that path and ended up being an embalmer. So did you take over the job? I started embalming bodies with him when I was ten years old and Oksu Station first opened. So you could say I was his partner. You remember all that? How could I forget? The first body I ever embalmed was an accident victim right when the station opened. The body was missing all its limbs. I see. Right. I heard you saw a child at the scene yesterday. Come on, man. Go easy on the booze. It's not booze, it's coffee. Why are you there? What's your name? 1211? That's your name? - Hey! - What? There's a big one here. It looks like a leg! Okay. She said her name was a number? She nodded her head. Hey, so have you met him? Yeah, he told me the same story. I can tell this article will get a ton of views. I actually have a favor. Could you get me a copy of the CCTV footage? Why should I? Articles like these lose their credibility without photos. I'll make sure to protect your identity. Please, Woo-won. SEONGDONG POLICE STATION Detective. Detective! That case already hit the media after yesterday's briefing. Why are you bothering me over old news? There was no mention of a kid. The embalmer said he saw one. You believe that? He's always drunk. He was probably hallucinating. It makes no sense. The subway's public service agent who was at the scene saw her too. Look, stop trying to get people's attention with a ridiculous ghost story. Act like a reporter. Is someone inside? Is someone there? If you're sick or need help, please let me know. I can't just open... Did you get spooked? You did, right? Fuck. What the hell was that? Sorry, Woo-won. I just thought it'd be funny. Read the room, will you? 1013? What's with him? I'll be back soon. - Hello. - Hey. Good evening, sir. I see you often at night. I just feel a bit restless after what happened the other day. Are you doing all right? Not at all. Cleaning up the accident is always a major hassle. I had so much trouble writing the statement. COPYING TO USB DRIVE - Choi Woo-won! - Yes? Don't get caught up in this ordeal, okay? Stay calm and stick with books. Got that? I will. Thank you. COPYING TO USB DRIVE Damn it. - Oh, shit. - 0329... I'm sorry. 0329... This is confidential, got it? All right. Thank you. By the way, the conductor... What about him? He was roaming around the station like a lunatic. He's not a station affiliate. It just feels strange to see him around the scene of the accident. - Is he still there? - Yeah. I just saw him. He went towards the platform. Hello, I'm Reporter Kim Na-young from Daily Modu. Would it be okay to interview you? Why are you still here? It won't come off. What won't? That. That thing. Did you by any chance see anyone else at the scene of the accident? Was there only one victim? No. Two. There were two. 0329... 0329... 0329... Sir? Hello? Na-young, this story is incredible. Did you see the footage? Of course I did! How did you get it? Anyhow, Ms. Mo wants this story posted pronto. I need to follow up on one more thing. I'll post it by 3:00 a.m. at the latest. Okay, keep it up! Excuse me? Could you tell me the significance of the number you said on the platform? I have to say it. Say what? I have to say it. 1211? 1013? Will you say it? Sir? 0329... Say it. Sir? Are you okay? I have to say it! EXCLUSIVE - FOOTAGE OF OKSU STATION'S ACCIDENT THE SUBWAY CONDUCTOR SAW A CHILD TOO! The next stop is Oksu Station. Three, four! -Congratulations -Congratulations -Happy birthday, Kim Na-young -Happy birthday, Kim Na-young -Congratulations -Congratulations -Happy birthday, Kim Na-young -Happy birthday, Kim Na-young But today isn't my birthday. You're the reporter to reach 300 000 views in the shortest time. At this rate, the story will reach a million views by tomorrow! If this isn't your birthday, then what is? It's really not. Go on, blow them out. Kim Na-young. Did you really interview the conductor yesterday? Yes. What time was that? It was about 10:00 p.m. Is something wrong? He was supposedly dead by then. The conductor is dead? Yes, you punk! He committed suicide around 9:00 p.m. last night. Who the hell did you interview? PLATFORM MECHANICAL ROOM That's enough, please stop. You really messed up this time, Reporter Kim. I'll post a correction. Correct what? Did you really not interview the conductor? Well... If you've never interviewed him and fabricated a story, you should resign and quit the trade, shouldn't you? Ms. Mo. The sister of the Oksu Station victim is on the line and asking for Ms. Kim. Isn't that great, Ms. Kim? Scoops are rolling into your lap. What's with your clothes... Why aren't you going? Right, okay. Why did you want to see me? My brother worked as a chef, so I couldn't understand why he went down there in the first place. But I think he went there to find a well. A well? Apparently, there were many wells in Oksu-dong. But most of them were sealed during the construction of the station. Actually, my father died at Oksu Station. He fell off the platform on the opening day of the station. And even though my brother and I witnessed it, we have no memories of it. That's totally understandable. So I even tried hypnotherapy. But whenever I tried to remember something, I just saw the well. I worked up the courage to look down into it, but that's where it ends. My hypnosis always ended there. So I thought maybe I was the reason my brother went to look for the well. I see. Why? Why? Is it too far-fetched? Interpreting his death as such? Not at all. I'm sorry for screaming at you. But... I want to believe that he didn't die in vain. Right. There's no such thing as a meaningless death. I'm ashamed of myself, actually. The accident had cost someone's life, but I didn't care about him at all. I know a place that could help us. There's an archive with records that pre-date the Internet. OKSU ORPHANAGE REPORTER KIM NA-YOUNG Did you see the photo of the well? Yes, it's exactly how I remember it. What about the next photo? Do you remember the orphanage? I remember the well very clearly, but I can't remember the orphanage at all. Okay. Anyway, I think Oksu Station was built near the well. What if your brother's search for the well led him to the closed platform? Thanks, Woo-won. I was too scared to come alone. Of course it's scary. I'm scared too. That's why I'm thanking you. Don't worry about it. I needed to cool my head anyway. Nail scratches are quite deep, right? Nail scratches? Do you know why I'm allowing you to take pictures? No, I'm not sure. Over the 30 years since the opening of Oksu Station, most of the people who died there had these scratches. And you're trying to expose it to the world. I'm so thankful. MOON DUK-SOO HWANG GEUM-SUN My father said there was a big grudge welling up around Oksu Station. But why has the number of accidents increased lately? It's not that it increased. It's accumulated. Subway accidents are boring. If it's boring, people won't care. That's how it is. But... why are innocent people being the victims of the curse? Once someone holds a grudge, they will lash out at the one who harmed them. But if they think that no one will help even with the passage of time, their hatred will expand to anyone and everyone. They end up blaming the whole world. You wonder why innocent people get to be cursed? It's simple. Because they're unlucky. That's it. 1001, come here. OKSU ORPHANAGE 1001, come here! REPORTER KIM NA-YOUNG TOMORROW'S ARTICLE WILL BE MORE SHOCKING I'LL MAKE SURE TO WRITE ABOUT YOUR BROTHER SOON. NEW DEVELOPMENT OF OKSU CASE... CURSE OF THE NAIL SCRATCH? Hey, Kim Na-young! Get over here! Come! This morning's article already hit a million views! Oh, really? Yeah, you punk! Gosh, you're my lucky charm! I'm sure more selfies will come up. That means they're reacting to the story. Selfies? Come here. Look. Isn't this incredible? This one too. The Summer It Girl's selfie. I SAW 0106 AT OKSU STATION, AM I GOING TO DIE TOO? LOL The post got over 100 000 likes already. Do we just sit back and watch? If people keep posting these... Come on. This is why we do what we do. Posting selfies, mean comments... It's all for fun. What if they get into accidents? That will get us more views, more ads, and more money. Na-young. We're not an authentic news outlet. We're a gossip tabloid. Don't forget what our articles are all about. Ms. Mo wants to see you. Go on. Did you want to see me? Ten million won for yesterday's article and another ten million for today's. Hit the jackpot three more times. The company will take care of your settlement. Thank you. What follow-up stories do you have in mind? I interviewed the embalmer again yesterday. Over 90% of those who died in accidents at Oksu Station since its opening had nail scratch wounds on their bodies. Evidence? He has photos of it all. Wow. This is turning into a major epic. Good, anything else? I'd like to write about the victim, Mr. Kang Tae-ho. Why? He had a unique story for going down to the closed platform. He apparently went there to find an old well in Oksu-dong. I'm not feeling it. I met his sister, and... Oh, her? Apparently, she checks in and out of an asylum. She can't be credible, can she? - Really? - Yeah. This one feels off. Shelf this one. Got anything else? What the hell? Sorry. You're on the night shift, right? So I've been told. - What's this? - What? What's with the scratches? I don't know, it just appeared. Are you the one who posted the selfie? I just did it for fun. It's annoying to see it get worse, so I'm going to get it checked out on my off day. - Make sure you do. - I will. I won't die, don't worry. I wish you would, you punk. What? Woo-won. Isn't that the Summer It Girl? Shouldn't we grab him and call Na-young? Let him be. Her company decided to take care of it. Is that right? Good luck. Later! What the hell? How annoying. A complaint was reported. Please check. Unpleasant noises were heard from the women's restroom by Exit 3 and some of the stall doors are stuck. I'm just outside. I'll check it out. If there's anyone inside, please say something. I'm here about a complaint. If there's someone here, please knock. Excuse me? Hello? Anyone inside? WRITE A EVOCATIVE STORY AND HEADLINE! Sir, this is just wrong. This story blew up nationwide. You realize I'm at a funeral of a close friend, right? You had no problem taking pictures at the morgue, so why not this? Listen. If people aren't criticizing you, you're not doing your job as a reporter. FUNERAL HOME You're awfully busy. You even came to the funeral to do your reporting. I'm not here to do that. I told you not to write a ghost story for some clicks, didn't I? Don't throw accusations when you don't know anything. A conductor, a cross-dresser, and now a public service agent. How is it that anyone associated with you ends up dead? How could you say that? You're insinuating that I intended all this. Am I wrong? Creating an artificial buzz, having people mimic it, and making them face accidents. And yet, you walk scot-free. Woo-won. Woo-won. Na-young... Good luck. Later! That number... I didn't want to say it. But... it felt as though I was possessed. So I ended up saying it. The first victim, the conductor, the cross-dresser... and even Seung-joon... They all died after getting this scratch. I'll end up like them too, right? Stop speaking nonsense. Why would you end up like them? You won't. What do those numbers mean? That's not important right now. Woo-won, If you don't want to die in vain, get your head straight. Got it? Okay. Are you okay? Yeah. I keep having the same dream. What dream? A well keeps showing up in it. A well? Yes. My friend keeps having dreams about a well. He has nail scratches and saw a 4-digit number. So I wondered if it had anything to do with you. If not, why would he dream about a well like you do? Don't you think so? I was actually... considering reaching out to you. I was going through my brother's belongings and remembered something. Really? It's about the Oksu Orphanage. That place... My father used to run it. And those 4-digit numbers are the admission dates of the children. Those are the dates he got paid. Someone mentioned there was a big grudge welling around Oksu Station. Could it be about the children? I'm not sure about that. By any chance, was there a phone among your brother's things? It works. There's a video. This is Oksu Station's closed platform. If you follow the tracks, you'll find an old construction tunnel. It's a dead end. No way... Are these... I found it. I finally found it! Those are bones, right? The children... must have been buried there. Hey, the CCTV. I'll go first. Hey. Watch out for the camera. Crouch down. Do we really have to do this? We have to try something. Maybe they asked us to call out their names to reveal to the world the injustice they suffered. We, at least, should do that for them. Who knows? They might let go of their grudge. Fine. I guess it's better than just sitting around. Let's go. - What are you doing? - My goodness. I wanted to film it just in case. Hold on. Got it. What's wrong? There's something in front of us. Woo-won, are you okay? Yeah... I'm fine. Woo-won! Na-young? Woo-won! Woo-won! Are you okay? I'm not sure. I don't know what's going on. You kept walking alone. Don't you remember? I did? I think it was here somewhere. It's the same spot we saw in the video. How did they end up getting buried here? So it's you guys. I'll tell the world about your grudge. How's your wound? It's still the same. It's still a wound. So it'll take time to heal. Yes. Now I can... arrange a funeral for my brother. Okay. Go in. Why? Just go EXCLUSIVE - CHILDREN BURIED IN OKSU STATION WELL Did you sleep well? I just came from filing an incident report. And I was guaranteed an exclusive. Have you checked the article? Children who were only called by numbers, wrongful deaths, and truths covered up by Oksu Station construction. That's the gist of it, isn't it? Then again, I thought I asked you to drop the well story. And yet you still went through with it. It wasn't intentional. Did you think getting an exclusive was enough to get me hooked? I don't need disobedient reporters. Yes, Ms. Mo? Put Ms. Kim Na-young on suspension effective immediately. Ms. Mo. What's wrong? Do you need reasons? Should I list them? I'll decide whether or not to publish the article. So go home and think hard about what you did wrong. Get out! Has she gone mad? What's with her? Listen to me, she has a reason. When she was manning the city desk as a rookie reporter, she supposedly looked into that well. But the higher-ups quashed the story thinking that her findings could delay the construction of the station. Then you brought that in as an exclusive. So no wonder she went berserk. But still, how could she suspend me? OKSU Evening, sir. - Going home? - Yes. That's good. You went through some intense stuff, so go home and get some rest. Everyone must be tired. I've never experienced anything like this before. I'm going to sleep. Good night, sir. Wait. What? What's with you? Why do I still have the scratches? Why do I still have them? Yours disappeared. Tae-hee. Why do I still have them? It's simple. I transferred it to someone else. Why are you doing this? - Why are you doing this? - Repeat after me! 1211! No! - Repeat after me! - No. Please don't do this! For the last time... repeat after me. One. One. Two. Two. - One. - One. One! One. 1211. 1211! Appease the vengeful spirits? You thought such a deep grudge would suddenly disappear as if it was nothing at all? It won't disappear until they had their fill of retribution. Not until they're satisfied. If it was so easy... why didn't you... I mean, you could have done it a long time ago! Even if you know how, you must figure out the nature of the grudge first. But that woman came by today and told me everything. She wanted to calm her brother's spirit or something. And then... How did he find out how to transfer the curse? He did say his father was more or less a shaman. But I'm here about something else. I finally remember. 1211! Appease the vengeful spirits? It won't disappear until they had their fill of retribution. Not until they're satisfied. I'm scared. 1211... 1211, don't be scared. It'll be okay. Today is a civil defense training day. I will punish you if you even let out a squeak. Be quiet. 1001, you come up. 1001... When you go up there, ask him to call my name. It's really scary here. - Me too! - My name too! - Mine too! - Call my name! Be quiet. Those kids... still remembered... that they could live if their names were called like mine. That's why they wanted their names called. I heard that my brother kept crying, begging to get me out. So my father caved and called my name. So your father wasn't your real father? We were adopted later on. But why did he bury them while closing down the orphanage? I found this among my father's things. It contains surgery dates for the children. Surgery dates? That means... organ trafficking? He buried the children alive... to get rid of the evidence. All right. So... who will you pass the curse on to? Hello? Hello? Woo-won? What happened? I was worried and called, but you wouldn't answer your phone. What's this number? I lost my phone. I wanted to change my number with the new phone. How's the wound? It's the same. There will be a way. Let's figure it out together. Okay, thanks. You know, I'll give you my new number. Can you text me later when you can talk? All right. Tell me. 010-1764-0816. 1764-0816. Did I get that right? 0816? Yes, it is. Woo-won, what's wrong? Is something up? No way... I'm sorry, Na-young. The location isn't important. You just have to stay close. How could you... I'm sorry. I really want to live. But it's not as easy as you'd think. You need a strong will to pass on the curse to that person. Because that person has to die in your stead. Also, that person has to know about the children. It doesn't matter if they believe the curse or not. The catch is... if you know someone like that. EXCLUSIVE - CHILDREN TRAPPED IN OKSU STATION WELL MO DU-YEON AND SPECIAL INTERVIEW TEAM What the hell? Why is my byline missing from my article? How could you steal my article by switching the headline? - Hello, this is Manager Sung of HR. - Yes? Ms. Mo wants you to resign from your post. DAILY MODU Kim Na-young. RESIGNATION LETTER Is this what you wanted? Look at all the mess you made. If the cops link the killings to your articles, it's all over. And I barely stopped them from filing a case against you. But... if you keep acting up, I can't help you. I don't want a fight, so I'll bite. But let me ask you just one thing. You knew the truth when you covered the Oksu Orphanage, right? That they were trying to cover up organ trafficking. Shortening the construction period was just an excuse, right? What are you talking about? I came to resign, so can't you at least tell me that? Am I right? Someone who reaped the benefit pulled the strings to have the higher-ups bury the story. Kim Na-young. Do you think life is all that easy? I'm right. It's written on your face. Read this for me. Out loud. I've had it with you. What the hell are you doing? Please read it for me. Then I'll hand in my resignation letter and walk away, with no further comment. What is it? Who cares what it is? Read it for me. Then this letter is yours. 0816, happy? Yes, I sure am. That was easy. THE GHOST STATION
