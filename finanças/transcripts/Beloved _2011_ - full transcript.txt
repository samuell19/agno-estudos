If Roger Vivier had not designed shoes for Christian Dior, my mother would never have been a whore I like the word whore. It adds to the story of my parents. The mother never said that word. She says it was just something she did occasionally. She was always in formal employment. That prostitution was extra money. Good morning, Madeleine. Good morning, Mrs. Menant. Mme. Menant. That night as they went up the stairs My mother figured her potential turnover. Counted all the shoes and dresses that she'd be able to buy.

Good morning, my princesses. -Vera, it's ten to eight. I'm not taking you by car, I did warn you. Yes I'm ready. I need 15 francs. -For what? I need 15 francs, that's all. You irritate me. I don't like to give money that way. Go. Hello! Mother dear ... Go. Take your scarf. I'm staying at Hotel Camellia. 4 D'Arcey Street Room 17. Are you coming now? Alright. You're super late. You should not have come. I leave by plane tomorrow. It is a medical congress. And they let you out? Don't blame the Communists. I knew you would turn communist. I don't know a thing about politics, but it is very beautiful. Please. Really. Your second marriage is good. You can notice. Long live France! You wouldn't understand, Jaromil. -I miss you. -I warn you, nothing will happen. I always think of you. And what do you think? I dream I'm making love with you. Yes? And it's good? It's hard to say. Very well. Invite me to go to your room but promise to behave. -You are beautiful. -No. Men no longer turn to watch me. -They pass me by. -Is it serious? Before I was a mother they whistled. Yes, it's serious. Is life passing me backwards. -You being childish. -Do you see this wrinkle? What wrinkle? -It wasn't there last week. No? I was sure you'd would do that. Why did you call? Either way, I don't care. -No. -Yes. -No. -Yes. Yes. Wait ... Wait. Many people have died in Prague in recent times. All around me ... Derek, Peter ... They were run by the Communists? No, I'm talking about people who simply die. Because of the sadness. Despair ... It is a very sad life. And you ... You're not sad ? I keep thinking about me. And when I think of me, I feel my heart beat weakly. I say, "Madeleine quickly, Madeleine think of me ... " "Think of me ..." But my heart remains weak. So I start to scream ... "Madeleine ... Madeleine ..." "... Think of me." You must hear me because ... I feel my heart beating again little by little. Don't mess with me. There's something between us that ... no divorce can make disappear. So why are we divorced? It's a good question. Why you married a policeman, is also a good question. He's not a policeman, he's a guard. It's the same thing. He's the perfect man for me. I'd pay to see that! Tell me about Vera. She's not a good writer. Liar. She writes every month, I make her. Force you mean. She doesn't like writing, is that it? Yes, she's 14 and does not want to do anything, it's normal. She looks like you. You know what? That girl is really his daughter. She wants to see everything Paris is not enough She likes nothing and wants to make her big exit. The smell of the trains, the noise from airports. She can't be quiet anywhere I wonder if she is vain If she uses the mirror and abuses her beauty She doesn't like anything, except going out at night She gives her hand to anyone at random, To resume it later. Miss Is it ... As you told me before, tell me. The son of a fish is fishy! -Miss ... -What do you know? -Is she ... -You should see her. She is more like to you than you think The son of a fish is fishy! You know what? That girl is really his daughter. Her eyes are so black that they sometimes seem frightening. your skin.... I remember the smell and of your skin I remember the feel. My God I cannot lie I wonder if this girl is beautiful Without lipstick, or painted eyebrows ... As lovely as you so that all the others are jealous She has breasts beautiful as these her waist, say yes. Miss ... Is she ... As you were, tell me. The son of a fish is fishy! -Miss ... -What do you want to know? -Is she ... -You should see her. She is more like with you than you think. the son of a fish is fishy! I wonder if the girl is like you Without memories, selfish and worry Playful and joyful is it inherited? This happy amnesia that you are living every day. As if for the first time Miss ... Is she ... As you were that age. The son of a fish is fishy! -Miss ... Playful and lively, -Is she ... An idiot-happy ... Is that what you think of me The son of a fish is fishy! If what you think of me ... Son-fish, little fish is! -Shut up. You know what I think very well. Her power is crazy men desire her for their selfish joy. It's your fault. They say "ready", I am in love with an egoist. I don't understand what you are saying. You've lost much of your French, you know? Is it a compliment or a criticism that you're giving? Did you know that it's sad when a man needs to change his idea of love in the middle of a sentence? Because of lack of vocabulary. Yes, it was more a compliment. Thank you. I can get a visa, you know? They explained to me all the documents, procedures ... I'll stay. If you and Vera come with me immediately. Why do you always do this? I love you. Jaromil. Don't laugh. No one's allowed to enter here. Do you know ... Do you know that to seek political asylum I have to ask the police. Maybe I can address the problem, whilst you're packing your bags. I'm not taking a bag. And don't make noise, run. -Good morning. -Good morning. Stop! Quick! Vera? -Vera are you home? I'm here. It's Jaromil. Your father. No greeting? We're leaving. We are three, the family. Fran?ois Gouriot, Understand? Go pack your school things. Take some clothes and put them in the trunk that's in the hallway. The rest we can get later, okay? -Return to Prague? -No, no ... Don't worry. But you have to be quick, we don't have much time. It's Dad returning. He'll wonder where I am. Take him to your room. Hide under the bed. Go with her. -Dear. -Where were you? I said, I went shopping. I was looking for a desk for the lounge. Oh yes. How was it? I didn't find anything. I searched everywhere, I'm exhausted. -And you? -Had a good day? -But you have to go back? -Yes. You work too much, dear. Vera ... Vera, I won't say ... your mother has not be educated as she should But you lack, baby, a father's words. The authority ... Especially now you are 14. I'm not afraid to say unpleasant things. You are my daughter and must be worthy. Understand, dignity is the ... most important thing for me. It's the alpha and omega. The moral backbone is dignity. Vera. Believe your father, dear. It is important when we are front of the mirror every morning when shaving. we are not obliged to spit at our own face. I don't shave in the morning. -But if you put make up on? -I don't wear make-up. You're right, it's useless. But the idea works, work when you comb. Every day take stock of the previous day. and always before a temptation, say: no ... tomorrow morning when I shave I will not be happy. When I comb my hair? combing hair, yes. I think it's very clear. Where are you sleeping? In a hotel near the Place Clichy. Tonight that will be our home and tomorrow ... and tomorrow we'll go to the home of your aunt. You're really going to spend all of your life with us? What is your mother doing? You do not hear anything more. I don't think it's a good idea that you go out these. I'll be careful. You know, it was easy ... It was cowardly, what I did, leaving Prague ... escape. He said he wanted to stay, wanted to resist ... But would I resist? The communists? It was not my problem. My problem was you, You had a bright future. I couldn't survice alone in Paris. He doesn't understand. He always believed I'd be back. He never knew how difficult it is to get a corner of our own. I made a living however I could. Now, he's returned, he wants me... then he doesn't want me anymore. Your father is just a man, Vera. Your father is perverse. Your father is a bastard. Vera, where you going? It was the end of the Passer family. The end of the story the whore and the infidel. I am the sex life of my parents, it's just who I am. If I look inside myself, that's the story I see. I was in the street, it was cold. I no longer knew whether I was angry with them I just remember wanting be loved intensely that night. I wanted to understand what caused me much pain. Everything was so peaceful, everything is silent a dream at night that passes They talk about it, but don't look at me. They are no more than I How I wish How I don't want to know For a sigh, how many shots? Everything is so calm apparently a dream at night that passes When finally he just loves me But just not enough. Only it's a lot to me. How it makes me loved and alive For a caress, these scratches? Everything is so calm after the dance a dream at night that passes When you finally loved me You act so formally love I don't know How hard is it ... of cold beds For those screams a whisper? Everything is so calm, a great calm. a dream at night that passes When I finally love, that's it ... What grants me this offense the warm refuge of your arms As everything is past time yesterday For a summer, how many winters How many winters How many winters How many winters Here in London I'm calling, I don't know where. I must have confused fog with blur. It's the fog Or that I'm black? Here in London I'm calling for those who don't know no answer, taxi stand empty It's the Thames Or that I'm gray Here in London, I'm calling I don't know how long Big Ben must have melted, I don't know what time it is. It's Oxford Street or that I'm sad? This isn't the Hyde Park I can't find any signs Here in London I don't know how I call must be bored is still waiting for me Is it Westminster Or you that awaits me? -Cl?ment, what are you doing here? -What? Where were you? I was worried. You forgot your coat. Were you cold? Sir, madame What happened? What happened? Did he upset you? No, I'm so tired. I was sad, predictable. Nandita decided I should go to sleep. What a crazy psycho fuck. She thinks she's my mother. She wouldn't let me touch her breasts. That's not fair, your room is much bigger than the mine. I'll sleep here. I don't know. Promise to behave? Clement? I promise. No sex between us. Not even the idea of sex. Together. My belts stuck, it wonm't unbuckle. -Can you help me? -Yes. But what happened here? Pull the other side. Wait. Let's sit down, it'll be easier. Like it when I grab that? No. And when I give you a kiss, you don't like it? No, don't be angry. Wait. Who is it? Be careful. -No problem. Ah, yeah! I'm sorry. The beaver is sleeping? You know why they have a flat tail? It is because I have a flat tail that you're calling me a beaver? It's because they were sucked by ducks. 200 pages and that was more a documentary ... Then reread these 200 pages I threw away erased that I didn't like about the teacher. Perhaps to keep the teacher character as a novelist. It was fun. You don't do that. I asked you to be here. Got it? go away, go away. You don't know me, so don't touch me! -You don't know me. -Don't touch me. Got it? I'm not afraid of you, fuck you. -I'm not afraid ... Cl?ment-! -Come on. - ... I'm not afraid of you. You do not do that when I'm here. Do not be a whore when I'm here. And you stay here now. Come, Nandita. What are you doing here? You were due back tomorrow. Father, please put on some underwear. I didn't warn you, because it wasn't planned. you are beautiful, my daughter, so beautiful. 19 years I haven't not seen you. I never forgot that I had a daughter. I came back. I'm here and I'll stay. I am living in the home of your aunt. But I'll get a house. You are beautiful. So let me get this straight, you're going to leave Reims and come back to Paris? No, no, no ... Your mother will not leave Mr. Gouriot. No, no ... he's retirement. She needs him to have a more peaceful life. You won't understand. I was talking with your father ... -He began to caress me ... No, stop mother ... I don' want to know. We didn't want go to go to a hotel. I had the keys to your home. I wanted to see where my daughter lives. -Really? -Yes. -Why come back early? -No reason. Restaurant ... Let's all go out to eat. As a family! I can't, I have to catch the 7pm train. You don't have a choice, we're goiong out to eat. You only need to tell Fran?ois ... I want you to dine with me and take the last train. You are forcing me lie and I don't like it. What? -Nothing, nothing. -It's beautiful. What? To see the two of you together is beautiful. I feel sorry for Fran?ois. He's no saint. One day, I had sex with a man in the barracks. And I picked up an infection. I had to talk to him. It was like walking on eggs, I was so nervous. No sooner had told him that maybe had an infection than he dropped to his knees, dropped to the floor Saying that I should forgive him that this woman had bewitched him, but he wouldn't see her again. Such a drama! Do you really need to tell me this kind of thing, Mum? Just to give you an example. For you to know your mother is not the devil ... Francois and Gouriot are not saints. And my father, thinking of going back to see him? What do you advise me? Would you be happy? That's the question. This is something that'll only be known in time, It's not worth thinking about now. Yes .. So you're thinking of returning to see him. If he wants to ... Perhaps, yes. You'll be waiting by the phone, trust me. You'll keep me informed? -And you? And your love? No, shut your mouth! I can't ask? It's too much. I found a person in London, an American. What's he like? He's very cute. He's very seductive, he's perfect and he's gay. That annoying. I advise you not fall in love. On the other hand, it could be amusing. I wanted to please become A light-hearted girl To free myself My heart is heavy and the reason is that love is made of lead Everything weighs, everything stops. What is the weight of feeling This daughter, like mother So I'll stay A light-hearted woman To avoid A heavy heart and its mysteries love is like a bag of stones Everything weighs, everything that harms never be sorry, just be But, much as I try I just keep falling in love The light-hearted girl has a heavy heart A heavy heart always takes The light-hearted girls and one day We have this feeling of failure of being superficially abandoned A heavy heart, forget it! This superficiality, I offer you You know that it risks nothing Do you get superficially disappointed to please him I went back to play the light-hearted girl I tried But now my heart weighs a ton This superficiality leaves me it's an amazing burden That's the weight of feeling I heard you get up, my dear. I found the Jaquis, this morning at the bakery. He invited us for a Tarot session tonight. Very well. Want to go? Yes, I want to go. Well, I have to go. I know that you like the rest of the morning. But ... What are you doing here? I didn't satisfy myself yesterday. I'm coming. No, don't come in. Your ex-husband is here. Oh yeah? Yes. It's beautiful backyard! Did you plant it, Madeleine? -Yes. Really? The orchard, too? -The backyard is her kingdom. Truth? I'll drink more coffee. Mr. Gouriot ... I will explain the reason for my visit. I came here to ask for Madeleine's hand ... Madeleine But what is he saying? Madeleine. I want her to be my wife. As in the beginning. I ask you to give her a divorce. I don't know if Madeleine want's one, so I thought ... it would be better ... if you were to tell her ... to leave with me. My dear, you should dress. -Yes. -I will talk a little with Jaromil. When you were the Republican Guard riding a horse? Don't think I'm stupid. You know, I know what happened between you after the divorce. I found several letters. in which you asked her for photographs in which you told her to sleep with other men and then tell you. Madeleine always obeyed you. I endured it. However, during all these years it was a heartbreak. I suppose that since you are in Paris, she will want to see you. I won't fight it. It is up to Madeleine. But you can be sure she will never leave. Because I really love and respect her. You can not understand. You don't respect anything. So listen, I ask you to leave my house and never return. Please. Wouldn't you rather kicked me out on my ass? He's gone. -I swear I knew nothing. -I believe you. Want a divorce? No, why? I didn't ask for anything! -So I hear ... Never deceive me, I know that you will never change. I will forget all about your relations with her ex-husband. Sure He was very pleased to come up here for me give this great news. I heard nothing, I don't know anything. And I do not want anyone else, besides the two of us know that. Don't say anything to our friends. Don't tell Vera. Never talk about the subject. -Continue to be your wife? -I don't talk about it. Of course you remain my wife. Not if you don't understand we have more than sex. -I understood. -It's up to you. This man, in my eyes, does not exist. I'm going to Nico, shall I bring crayfish for lunch? A good idea, crayfish. Good morning, ma'am. -Good morning. I'm sorry. Can I talk to you a second? -What is it? -Damn, you scared me ... I thought you would not talk me anymore. One more. -Today is the day of presentations -Yes. It is the turn-of whom? It's not here. It must be here, look! She told me, "Kuntz" behind the "Gare de L'Est." -Look, "Kuntz". - "Kuntz." "Kuntz, Kuntz". It seems "Apocalypse Now", but in Alsace. Colonel Kuntz. What are you doing in there? My dear! Clement, I'm glad to see you. Me too, I'm happy. -And this meeting? I took advantage of the fact that she is in Paris for you ... and bought a birthday present. It is from me and your father. -Yes? We bought it together this afternoon. Open it, I'm on tenterhooks. He's staying on the second floor. He's sleeping, we shouldn't not wake him. Coming to the station? You're not staying? No, Fran?ois would be worried. No, I'm really here for your birthday. -It is a DVD player. -How kind. Don't be like that. We'll have a party on Sunday anyway. -You coming, Clement? -Sure I will. My father is staying in that hotel? It's very practical. I can come and go on the same day. It is somewhat my second home. Yes, but whoever has two homes, has lost their mind. If you could try not to have an opinion. Whenever I want to see him. It worries me to leave him alone in Paris like this. I need him. I need him so much. Good, but I will not bore you with that. But you'll have to decide. You can't hide forever. But why? We like it this way. I must go, or I'll end up arriving late. Could we stop fooling ourselves? -What did you say? -Nothing. Forget it. -Have a good journey. -Yes. -What? -I speak of faithfulness ... It's a good thing fidelity, when you love someone. -Are you serious? No, I'm tired. When I'm tired I'm sentimental. I'm very tired. Was that was picked out of love or because she's tired. Yeah, I'm encouraged to regain my strength. I prefer vitamins. A, B, C, D. Let's go to the pharmacy. -Want it? -Slutty. I would spend hours waiting in the rain I believe I cry But not cry water from the sky like a charm falls on my face destroyed A parody of tears Which doesn't fool you would pass without you would pass without you would pass without you would pass for better I would spend hours waiting in my bed Would you believe I was dying But I didn't die Is it just a dream. A dying dream I'll pretend that I'm dying hours will not believe would pass without you would pass without you would pass without you would pass for better I would spend hours Waiting for you anywhere Would believe that you love me But you do not love me For no matter how much I cry or die it doesn't change anything Our love is only my idea would pass without you would pass without you would pass without you would pass for better -The fish is for whom? Thank you It is for me. Thank you. -Enjoy. -This is good. What are you eating? You should not eat ... such sophisticated things. Enough already, don't start. That's a meal -French. -So go on attack. I was careless. You? No. It's your mother that is careless. You are brave. I don't see the courage to love someone who does not want me. You know what it is to be brave? You do ... whatever the cost even knowing ... that you'll lose. That's courage. Courage and caution are virtues fundamental. -Yes? -Yes. Our virtues, Your mother and mine are carelessness, pride ... pleasure, anger. Yes. -You never wear colorful clothes? -I don't look good in them. Come ... I want to buy a dress. No, you do not have a father. -No, c'mon, c'mon. -No. You can't ... I am your father and I will buy you a dress. You must be married to wear a sari. I've never heard such idiocy. Come on, come on. Go in. Choose. This pattern is beautiful, no? Try this, go into the changing room. 30 years of dictatorship leaves traces. You are very cute? This is not pretty for a girl like you. Go, go, hurry up. -I have an appointment. -The changing room is ... You have a meeting with whom? With a person I see in secret. No daddy, don't start. Shit. -800 Franks? -Yes. Thank you. -So? I do not know even how to put it on. You have to tie it. Hurry up. You have beautiful legs my dear. Until Friday, until Friday. Goodbye. Look out! Okay? Don't move, we should send for a doctor ... -A doctor, no. -You'd better sit down. I am a doctor, leave me alone. Jaromil ... You are the Vera-Passer? -Yes. Can you come with me, please. This way. Let's sit down a minute. I just saw the results of the examination done on your father. The strike caused a mild bleeding and a concussion. It is important with a blow to the head. Unfortunately, the lesions are too serious for us to operate. He's been hospitalized with the rehabilitation service. Can I see him? Yes, for sure. I'll go with you. The nurses are preparing him. Want some coffee while we wait? No, the doctor will see him? -I am the doctor. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. No offence. This way. I really liked the dress, you know. You're right, I look good in pink. -So? -We don't know anything yet. -Cigarette? -Yes. -It was nice of you to come. -That's what friends do. See how we can be friends? Finally, this is more like old times. No, come here. We were lovers 6 times a couple for four days and a half, and the 3rd night of the story we were almost parents. Yes, in the end just ... becoming friends, after completion of a transaction. It's not true. After sex there was a little tenderness. -A great tenderness. -A great tenderness? Yes, That now gone. I think we are too old for tenderness. You're not even 30. Yes, but it's all screwed up. In one or two years, students will call you "uncle." -You got a tattoo? Not real-shit. A girl who wrote this for me to remember her. I should have taken a bath before I came, I was stupid. -Not with anyone? -I'm with Henderson. How so Henderson. He came back to see you? No. I'm always thinking about him, it's pathetic. It's impossible to imagine you with another man. He's my imaginary husband. Yes, marriage is more abnormal since there are weddings. Do you believe in fate? I need fresh air. I have not found a girl who's neck I'd write on. Why not? It seems ideal for you. Where are you going? Don't you see that is my handwriting? Why did you do it? Cl?ment. We got lost. -Yes ... -Know where they put him? Yes, down the hall. Okay, Fran?ois? Vera? I don't understand. I shouldn't be here. I don't understand. Let's talk in French, then? -Try! -Okay. There is one thing I have to tell you I think I'm HIV positive. Yes, yes. I was super cautious. I was crazy in New York. Very crazy. One night, I found a man in a bar. I was drunk I do not remember anything. The next morning in my room ... Do not remember the sex ... but I knew I we'd done it ... without a condom. How do I cure myself of such stupidity It makes ... It makes me fear the worst I panicked ... I decided to leave New York. With this kiss I give you. You'll say I stole it I feel faint because it makes me feel good Say it to me rather than make me But our kisses are worth nothing which means they are priceless What good can you expect to come of it? What I fear is the worst Who do you love? This song that I kept for you Do you want to play the game? Who do you love? not answering, is killing me Let's stop playing games With my hand I reply to you I still say you're being rash I'm trying to be cautious I still say that you're a coward Give up, you barely know me I know enough and I still persist Someone else would be more convenient Other people are also sad Who do you love? This song that I kept for you Do you want to play? Who do you love? Don't answer, it'll kill me Let's stop playing games. I predict failure Only if you cause it I'm trying to curb our impulses I still say that you're mocking me. Why not, my angel? This love only raises questions In your opinion who is to blame? Who do you love? This song that I kept for you Do you want to play? Who do you love? Don't answer, it'll kill me Let's stop playing the game On 9/11, my daughter embarked on a plane to New York. She said she would visit her American. Who had returned to America. She said it was Henderson who asked her to go. he had left his boyfriend. And wanted to see her. European flights to New York were diverted to Canada. After the attack against the twin towers. Vera landed in Montreal All flights were suspended. Stuck there. Air France arranged this hotel. I don't even know what part of the city I'm in. Henderson will pick me up by car he has the address. Is Montreal near New York? Give or take, six hours. He should arrive tonight. You had told me that they lost your bags on the plane. They'll send them to New York. You shouldn't go there. You should return to France. Mother, there is no probability of that happening. You've driven here by cars An open grave, the night All was joy, nothing was right Like a drop of water, anything is possible Nows the end of playing games What became of your kisses? Youth passes And I accept Unfortunately my Summer was not a good one You danced like crazy lived madly, drunk everything You do can't touch the ground anymore But now you're on your knees the time for songs is over What became of your efforts? Youth passes And I accept Unfortunately my Summer was not a good one You've loved so many times You were beautiful, try not think about it Because that life ends here The bad times will come Who broke This line of flight? What happens next? Youth passes And nothing can be done Unfortunately September Has come... The French never forget to eat. Okay ... Don't start! Mathieu. How is New York? It's weird ... distressing, unreal ... Strange, a strong smell ... like dust burned. Sometimes smells of petrol You're Henderson's boyfriend? Yes more or less. I'll see if they're still serving food in the restaurant. Want something? Mother, did I wake you up? I'm sorry. No, it's okay, I'm fine. We leave tomorrow morning. I'm very happy to be with Henderson. Go back to sleep. I love you very much. What? Can't I say that I love you? Go back to sleep. Have they restored the networks? Do the phones work? I don't know, I haven't tried. -Am I bothering you? -No. I'm going to bed. -But that stupid. I woke you up? -Stop ... It's your room. Henderson is sleeping. Completely wiped-out. He's a heavy sleeper. I'm not sleeping my friends. Okay? Want a drink? Can you change the channel? Yes. Before leaving the room Vera stole all of Henderson pills. She went to the bar. And swallowed them all discreetly. The whole box. A lethal dose. Nobody saw her take the pills. People remember her dancing alone in a corner. People didn't want to look at her. My daughter who danced through the night. They were ashamed. And then ... those sitting at the bar... they saw nothing. We have just seen your mother, Cl?ment. Sorry you're sick. Your parents were never vaccinated? No, it's not worth taking, unless you're a child. I saw on the Internet that pertussis is infectious for 4 weeks. Yeah, I know. But I'm still tired, be careful. We should have called before, we apologize. We are ashamed to have guests, you are sick ... That's how we learned of the death a friend of Madeleine. No, but it was a good idea this invitation, I think that ... very good, for you to make a party. I will not lie, we wanted to see you. Madeleine has always asked me to invite you. You're the only one present she wants. -It's next Wednesday? Yes, lunchtime. There's a train that arrives at 12:13. I confess to being a little afraid of seeing them. I don't know if I can face it all. He is saying won't have the courage. What an idiot! He can roast and eat their balls, Can we count on you, Cl?ment. Yeah, I gotta go. I have ... I have to go, a kiss! -Okay? -Stop! You're crazy. What is it? Yes, Madeleine. I told your husband that I would. Is that clear enough. Kate ... I say that maybe you'll buy ... These shoes So beautiful and too expensive for me. Friday without fail, I will pay ... the bill. Saturday, go out with you. But next Wednesday I'm not going to Reims Moreover, no one goes to Reims There's nothing there, just cemeteries nothing and still less for me. I will spend the Sunday at home between four walls. Monday, I will go to the movies. Tuesday, I don't know, but the only thing I'm sure is that on Wednesday, I'll be here. Thursday, whatever. I'm not going to Reims Clean the grave, see the rocks bloom. After all, Wednesday If it rains inside The rain will clean the cemetery I won't do it, I have too much to do Promise I'll be sick, I'll catch a cold. that's what's planned for Reims on Wednesday The thermometer below zero, that's why Wednesday, I can tell you now I'm not going Reims Reims is quite depressing under the arcades Wednesday, it's certain that the trains to the region will pass winter without me. For Wednesday, I've decided I'm not going to Reims Where she nourishes the land My God, how I envy this land Which hugs your body in its arms It's Mireille. Come in, come! -Okay? -Yes. Everybody in the lounge. It's at the back of the house. -Okay? -We waited for you at lunch! Lunch was for close friends Coffee is for the neighbors. -Why didn't you come for lunch? The trains were on strike. Only running a skeleton servive, I had to wait ages. I spent the day at the station. No scolding, please. Thank you. Madeleine had a crisis because you did not come. She locked herself in her room. Didn't want to eat. I couldn't get her to leave the room. -A cigarette? -Yes. Thank you. Got a light? She's upset, you know. For weeks ... had been fine and then out of nowhere. She doesn't want to see anyone, won't speak to me. for days ... And then one morning, She makes coffee and laughs. As if nothing had happened. Yes, she lost her daughter. It's no small thing. -Now she's all alone. -All alone ... All alone ... Shit, what about me? for 34 years she's lived with me. She's not alone. But how stupid is that? If I stay, will she open the door. I've never done this through a closed door. What are you talking about? My dear. Cl?ment just arrived. He's here by my side. I'll leave you alone. Do something about it. Come in. Good afternoon. Are you alone? Yes. Won't you look at me? Don't you want to look at me? I'm ugly. I'm tired of crying. You never cried before. No, you're right. I never cried so much. However, sadness ... I was sad, but I could control myself. This is already happening. I can put up with ugly faces. It is not ugly, it's beautiful. He said I was depressed? No. He said you were not well. He says it to everyone. It's crazy, I'm fine. There are days when I ... I can not look at him. He's not guilty, so is ... You see, there are mornings when is difficult to say to someone ... "I love you" thinking, "I don't love you." Well, I think that's what happiness is. Don't make fun. I no longer think about happiness ... Not for a long time. It doesn't stop me from being happy. I trust in life ... but do not trust happiness. You are depressed. They are going to light the candles ... Want to go? Really? -Yes. Seriously. Go down for a bit. Blow out the candles and then come with me, okay? Come on. I'll wait below. Be quick. Happy birthday to you ... Happy birthday to you ... Happy Birthday, Madeleine ... Happy birthday to you ... Blow. Congratulations, congratulations. Where are you going? Clement wants to leave. I'm going with him to the cemetery. Let's look at Vera, before you catch the train. -Want me to take you in the car? -No. Let's walk, it will do me good, I drank too much. -But you're coming back? -Beautiful your new toy, Jackie. Bye, Fran?ois. Bye! Okay? Vera was a gift for you. You were never married, but were always in love. Don't say stupid things. -There are no happy marriages. -You don't say. She was never in love with me. -You think so? -You know. No, I do not know. Vera always managed hide her feelings. Well, I realized that she loved him. -I wouldn't call it love. -What would you call it? She dreamed of being Henderson's wife. If that's not love? -A melodrama. -So you're saying she never loved him. That man never loved her. You were the one who loved her. What is better, being the who is beloved or being the lover? His place. I would have given my life to be in his place. You're right. Cl?ment, catch the door. I'll explain. You know, I already know the story. How you fell in love with a client, a medical student. That didn't work, bringing him to your apartment. This part I also know. That Vera was conceived, that first time. Your freedom, his joy. I was not an easy woman, by any means. At the time it was easy, very easy. But Vera was not conceived here. I was just saying, I don't want to know. It was him who wanted me. Vera always thought that I was passionate about her father, but no. We spent the night together and then ... in the morning I sent him away. He didn't want to He wasn't working. I'm not your toy. Not my toy? So what are you? -A whore. -Madeleine, please. -I'm in love with you. -That's absurd. -You love all French women. -I'm not crazy about all French women. I'm not crazy about De Gaulle, just you. You're beautiful. Today finds me beautiful and tomorrow, who knows. Whether you'll fall for me? I am not indifferent to your Russian charm. I'm not Russian. What do you mean "indifferent"? You're allowed to love me. Thank you. -Go away. -Bye, Mrs. Whore. -Goodbye, Mr. Customer. Have you ever loved a man? You have to go. It's something that no man ever dared to ask you ... and are you ready to do it for me? I'm cold. I feel very cold. Love me forever. You're forbidden to love other men. There are some people who spend their lives. Who take so long to understand that ... freedom is the worst offense to love. Since the death of Jaromil ... I am not the same, and you've disappeared as well. That when he went so did I I no longer recognize myself. It's not pretty when you miss someone. Mother always said "It's not pretty when you miss someone." Thank you. I waited for you to detest me. Nothing, nothing more Of our love, what remains? So little meat and so much blood So little meat and so much blood you're no longer here, but nothings changed The problem remains the same I can live without you but ... What kills me, my love is ... That I can't live without love I waited hoping to be excluded Nothing, nothing do I feel As life passed quickly by. Like everything seems slower Like everything seems slower You're no longer here, but nothings changed The problem remains the same I can live without you but ... What kills me, my love is ... That I can't live without love I expected the flood Fire and torrential rains A torrent as a last wish But nothing comes and takes me But nothing comes and takes me You're no longer here, but nothings changed The problem remains the same I can live without you but ... What kills me, my love is ... That I can't live without love I can live without you but ... What kills me, my love is ... That I can't live without love
