Aah. Aah. - Hi. Good morning. - Good morning. I'll finish this up. I'm heading out, anyway. I have to meet up with Leo. - Have breakfast first. - Mm. The t-shirt suppliers are coming in early. Leo might get overwhelmed. I have to check the restaurant for the meet-and-greet with the governor. If I were you, I'd let Leo handle it. He's the public official, not you. Let him learn. But this isn't just for Leo. This event is important for me, too. I truly believe the governor is the hope of this nation. Whoever the hope of the nation may be, I'm sure they're having breakfast now. So you should, too. Plus, you shouldn't get too involved. These politicians, they're all the same. That's fake news. About Villanueva? I hope so. Hi, baby. Hi, baby. How was your sleep? Hmm? Baby... I know a most-important meal of the day. Breakfast. - Governor, may I ask a question? - Yes. We know you're running an anti-drug campaign this election, but is it true that Mr. De La Vega is your business partner, the one suspected to be one of the biggest drug suppliers in the country? We are not partners. Period. Once I'm elected, I will make sure that the De La Vegas face the justice they deserve... You monkey! You wouldn't be in your position, if not for me. Boss, I have a present for you. Boss, here is the present I mentioned. Boss, have mercy on us. Please have mercy. You two traitors, you've got balls. I'll give you that. But what I really want to know is... who's the real traitor? That's right. It's the end for you two. Look at these two... Kaleb and Victor. Always at each other's necks. Complete opposites. But one thing they have in common... they have loyalty. Right. We need loyalty. Loyalty? You backstabbing son of a bitch! You thought I wouldn't find out? Huh? You two. Girls. Boss, we gave you the names. Okay. Let's get down to business. Let's talk about Governor Villanueva. This guy talks too much. He's making too much noise. It's making our clients nervous. So, we've got to shut him up. - We need to do this now. - Easier said than done. If you'll allow me, I can bring my men there right now and take care of this. Handle it? Handle it the way that you handled Santiago? Listen, asshole, I completed the mission. Kaleb, are you fucking serious, man? Are you that dumb? We're all under investigation because of you. - You fucked up again... - Sir. - Okay. - Thank you, sir. Hey. Now make sure... that you take care of those crawling snakes. I want heads cut. Okay? Why? What do you mean why? Why do you let Kaleb go all around just to fuck shit up? Then I have to go out there and clean his mess up. Victor, Victor... In this world, everybody has a place. And in this family, I call the shots. Do you understand me? I want to hear it one last time. Do you understand me? Yes. - Bye-bye. - Bye-bye. Oh, baby, buckle up. - Ready? - Yes, Mom. Mommy, look. Wow. My baby's really smart. You got that from me. Hi, hon. I just picked up Min-Min from school. - Hi, Daddy. - Hello, baby. Did you have fun in school? Tell me about it later, okay? We're heading home. Go home early, please? Yes, hon. I'm fixing a few things here at the campaign. Then I'll be on my way home. Drive safe, okay. I love you. I love you, too. Bye. Mmm. Yum. Yum. Really? You guys are really alike. - Mommy, it's really good. - Both of you are always pulling my leg. It's good, right? Governor, can you say that the allegations that you're connected to the De La Vegas are all fake news? Of course. But let me ask you this... why is the media sensationalizing the De La Vegas? They're just making him look bad. You know, I still believe he's a good guy. He's the hope of the nation. Hey. What's with the face? What face? You're frowning. You look irritated. This is how I always look. Really? Through all our years together, you still don't know me? Yeah, right. You know what? Now that I think about it, the governor is truly inspiring. I really believe in what he's fighting for. He is really the only hope of our nation. Whatever. I'm just gonna take Min-Min upstairs. Hey. Lighten up. I'm just kidding. Security's tight. There are eight in plain clothing just outside the restaurant. Hey, uncle. - Leo. - I'll go ahead. Hi, auntie. Thank you so much for coming. Hey, uncle, you ready? Of course. How about you? You're nervous, huh? Not really. I think you're the one that's nervous. Me? Hey, mister, what's that? - Baby... - Ah, this? Didn't I tell you to stay close to me? - I'm sorry. - It's okay. I'm so sorry, officer. It's no problem at all. Babe, we're just going to go around for a bit. Okay. You can just wait here for your governor. Okay. - See you later. - Thank you. See you later. Bye-bye, baby. Bye, auntie. Bye. Do you just want to go and eat at home? Hmm. - This time, play it quietly. - Yes, sir. I'll be going out of the country soon with our partners. Once you're done with the governor, head back. Copy that. Sir. Out of the way. - Watch it. - Where is she? - Who, sir? - Her! Where is she? She just left. - Circle the area, all right? Find her. - Yes, sir. Let's go. We have to now look at laws that will make sure that the government... the government will not spend money uselessly. That we promise you. Believe that the government now, if you put me there, will be behind you all the way to help the small businesses. But... it's only up to all of us. It's only up to all of you. So, my friends, please don't forget this coming election... I was watching that. All you think about is the governor. You're already wearing his face and did your part to support him. Isn't that enough? Is it wrong to support an honest politician? - He is the hope of the nation... - Hope of the nation. I already know. That's all I hear from you. - And then what's the problem? - Nothing. Nothing at all. It's just that you've paid him more attention than your own family. I just want to help him win. By neglecting me and Min-Min? Ach. Please don't. Don't hurt me. Stop. Please. Please have mercy on me. - What do you want? - Status? Who are you to question me? Just trying to help. I'll send some men over. Expect them tomorrow. Listen, I didn't ask for your help, you asshole! Fuck! Hit him again. Stop. Look what you did. He's fuckin' passed out. Fuckin' monkey. Sorry about that. Can you wake up for me? Can you wake up? Wake up! Listen. No matter what you say... it doesn't fuckin' matter, okay. This whole thing... it's a big show. I'm gonna tell you what I'm gonna do next, all right? I'm gonna take that stick... and I'm gonna shove it right up your ass. Here we go. Holy fuckin' shit! Victor! I told you... to eliminate the snake. Has he given a name? I want a name. Nope. No name, sir. Unh. Hit harder! - I don't want this anymore. - What? Us? No. The killings. I don't want to kill anymore. You know it's part of our lives, something we can't escape. Especially you. Look. Tell you what... we have one more mission left. After that, I promise. I'll talk to him. Okay? You know I love you. Aah. Clean up this fuckin' mess. I'm not going anymore. I was thinking about what you said yesterday. So today... it's family time. I was also thinking about what you said yesterday. Because of me... you weren't able to meet the governor... and I know how important that was for you. So to make it up to you... I'm going to cook us a special dinner. So we're good? All right. I'm only gonna say this once. I don't care if Victor sent you. If you're here, that means you take orders from me. Got it? All right, good. The governor will be leaving today for his next venue. Miru, I want you to take five men. You tail the governor. If there's an opening, you take it. - Sir? - Something more important has come to my attention that I need to resolve immediately. So me and the remaining men will be handling that first. - Is that understood? - But, sir... Do as I say, Miru. Copy. All right. For those who are staying... I forwarded a picture of a woman, two men, and a child to each of you. Remember their faces. The mission is simple. You find them, you bring them to me. I will not tolerate any fuck-ups on this job. What the fuck you all standing around for? Go. I want you to keep an eye on them, huh? I don't trust that fuckin' Victor. You can really see that our campaign's gonna turn out great. Your uncle's amazing with all his help. - Yeah, I know. - What help would you need for tomorrow? What's our schedule tomorrow? - Do we need to do anything else? - Maybe the... - Nobody move! We need him. - Move back! Don't follow us. Tank. That's enough. - Tsk tsk tsk tsk. - What did I do wrong? Have mercy. Please. I apologize for the inconvenience. I do. I know you must be tired. But I just have to make sure I get everything I need from you. Anything. I'll do anything. Please just let me go. I don't want any more. No more. Please. No more. I know. No. Don't! Don't! Don't! Don't! Aah! No more! - Shh. - No more! - No more! - Quiet. Just stay quiet. I don't want any more! Please, no more! You're almost done. - This one's my favorite. - No! Don't! I'll do anything! Follow her. There! You had her, and you let her fuckin' go! This woman is more dangerous than all of you combined! Let these fuckin' morons be an example. You take caution! Listen up. I lead... you follow. Bert! Min-Min, Bert, we need to go. - What? Wait. Wait. Maria. - Take only the important things. We need to pack. - Hurry! I'm sorry, baby! - Mommy! Hey! What's going on? You're scaring Min-Min! - Maria, explain to me what's going on. - Bert. You're scaring her! Don't ask. Please just do what I tell you! Explain to me what's going on first! Slow down! Calm down! There's no time! Please, we have to go now! Baby, it's okay. It's okay. Mommy's here, okay. Mommy's here. Don't cry. Don't cry... Bert, please. I'm sorry. Who the hell are you? Mommy! - What do you want? - I want her. - Who are... - Drop the gun, Lily! - Lily? Who's Lily? - You know me. Drop it! - Just leave them out of this. - Put the fuckin' gun down, Lily! - Put it down! - Mommy! Mommy. Mommy. Mommy. Mommy. Leave my family alone! Don't touch them! - Daddy. - Min-Min. Min-Min! Aah! Min-Min! Now you know how it feels. Lily, finish it. They're not the target. You. No matter where you go, I'll find you, Lily. You hear me? You can't hide! Min-Min. - This is your fault, Lily. - Min-Min! Maria, behind you! What's the status? Is it done? - We got bigger problems in our hands. - What's going on? Everyone's dead. What do you mean, everybody's dead? - She's still alive. - Who's she? Lily. Lily's still alive! Min! Min-Min! Min! - Sir. - Fall back. - Meet me at the safe house. - We're not yet done here-- Now! Drive faster. - I'm done with the killing. - We have one mission left. After that, I promise you. I'll talk to him. You know I love you. Thank you. No matter where you go, I'll find you, Lily. You hear me? You can't hide! Now you know how it feels. Min-Min! What? I'm retired. There are others out there... who can do whatever job you may have. Oh, motherfucker. Sir Greg... I need a place to stay. Lily. Lily, there's lots of cheap hotels in the city. For only 180 pesos, you have a room with AC, - free breakfast... - Sir Greg. Whatever it is, I don't want to know, and I want nothing to do with it. The end. Please, as a last favor. What a pain in the ass. Can't I have some peace and quiet before I crawl into my fuckin' grave? Last favor? I thought the last favor was the last favor... and that was that. Look... I love you with all my heart... but my old ticker... isn't like it was before. Sometimes I just want to leave this goddamn country, away from that family... that syndicate... and everyone else who's involved with it. You were part of it. Today I am here reporting on the aftermath on what can only be called a massacre. A father and daughter dead along with an unknown number of men is all we could get from the police and investigators on the scene. What's the situation? Boss, reporters are at the scene. And some of the dead men here can be identified as your men. Fix it. Make sure this doesn't come back to us. Multiple armed dead men... plus a dead little girl. Didn't you hear what I said? Fix it or else. Yes, boss. I'll take care of it. Ahh. Aren't you... supposed to be dead? That was Lily. That's what I said. So what now? Are you supposed to be a zombie? It's Kaleb. Kaleb? A zombie? What's he have to do with anything? I'm going to kill him. Kill him? Why? Is it for revenge? Listen... nothing good will come from revenge. Nothing. If I were you, I'd pick a small town. You're still young. Look for a good man... raise a family... and live happily ever after. That's what I did. So... What the hell are you doing here, then? Go back to them. There, you've got... Kaleb murdered them. Ah... I see. Okay. Okay. You can stay here for now. Sir Greg. What is it? Lily is dead. My name is Maria. Lily. Maria. You can be the immaculate virgin herself... for all I fucking care. Is this a trend? Fine. I'll be Jesus then. I am cancelling my trip. Why? Guys, get out. What now? Would you believe... that that bullshit Lily is still alive. Kaleb. Kaleb, Kaleb. And to think, this whole time... we thought he handled that problem. First, the governor. Then the fuckin' traitors, and now... this. Listen to me. Take the trip. I'll handle this. Like I always do. What do you need? Finish her. Who's she? An old associate from Black Rose, like you. Maybe better. Location? Old man Greg. But our family has an agreement with him. We can't touch him. Do not let me down. Make sure he understands. Well, lucky me. Two gorgeous women with bangin' bodies in one day. You must be Kaleb's new girlfriend? You do know the agreement I have with his family. I do. Really?

Sorry, sir. Do you have a cigarette? Don't apologize to me. Apologize to Bogart. He's the one that got beaten to a pulp by a woman. I'm a woman. But seriously, Lily... I trained you to be better than this. Maria, sir. Okay. Well, fine, Maria. I still remember you as Lily. Lily's dead. Bert, we need to go. - Mommy. - I'm sorry, baby. You're scaring Min-Min! Don't ask. Please just do what I tell you. What do you want? - Who are you? - Drop the gun. Lily? Who's Lily? You know me. Drop it! - Just leave them out of this. - Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! Mommy!

But I still molded you into a killer. We both know death... all too well. We should be numb to it. And... when they put a hit out on you, it broke my heart... to have to be the one to put you down. Main reason why I retired... Thank you, Sir Greg. Pleasure's all mine. Just give my regards to Jesus... or the devil. She's dead. I turned my back to that life. The downside... I couldn't avenge you. Don't ever think nothing good will ever come to you again. Because as long as you're breathing... you'll always have the chance to find happiness. I'm going to need some equipment. Our factory is in ashes. I already know, Victor. We can easily acquire a new base of operations, so don't fuckin' lecture me! Okay, good. I'm taking over. On whose fuckin' orders? I can't allow you to continue to jeopardize... You can't allow me? Huh? Who the fuck do you think you are? I'm gonna say this one last time, Victor. You stay the fuck out of my way! There he is. Right there. Okay, pull the trigger. There you go. That's what I thought. You can't do it. Let me ask you this question. You know why Cain killed Abel? Because Abel was a fuckin' pussy like you. I'm gonna fuckin' kill you, Victor! You hear me? One day, I'm gonna fuckin' kill you! She was dead once. Let's make sure she stays that way. And, Miru, don't fuckin' fail me again. Investigators are yet to announce the cause of the fire that engulfed a factory late last night at Santa Cruz, Manila. But for the meantime, our sources do confirm multiple casualties. According to initial reports, the fire started past midnight... Wow. You're famous now, huh, dear? See. Headline.
