A Summer at Grandpa's Headmaster, ladies and gentlemen Headmaster, ladies and gentlemen All of my dear teachers And all students in campus Six years ago, as I first came into our school Everything to me was so fresh and interesting I didn't understand Why the graduates always cry at graduation Now I understand My heart is so heavy at this moment of parting Like a leaking faucet my tears flow Time passes amidst the laughter What left are the memories and the reluctance to leave We are about to part from this womb of 6 years Inexpressible feelings well up through the heart And an incomprehensible sorrow brings tears Yet I think of our completed education We are striding unto a new journey Toward more knowledge Excitement grips my heart and a prompting sense of uncertainty These 6 years We have cried, we have laughed, we have had fun We tasted the flavor of a beating Happy Physical class fascinating science Math riddled with puzzles Clashing and other noises making in music All, all this shall forever preserve and be printed in the mind So hard to forget Teachers, dear teachers! Under the beating sun, you led us in exercise Mom Hi! How do you feel? All right, sister? Chang-ming is here, too? Uh... this is Pi-yun...

Miles after miles, I bid you farewell Distance grows each day, While we are apart The road is long and winding, The day we meet again is far The Hun horses bathe in the north wind The Viet birds rest in the south trees Let her have the baby Poor child! It'll do her mental illness a lot of good I've already asked Mrs. Tren to take care of it Well How about having her sterilized after childbirth I'm concerned about the possibility that the baby will be born retarded just like her? That's right! Then it'll really be a pity No, it won't Uncle Uncle Uncle Uncle Uncle Don't be so loud! Where do you stay now, uncle? On the old street. Want to come over? Sure, just a second! What a naughty boy! Tell your girlfriend, I really can't go there Alright Pi-yun! Pi-yun! How do I look? Not this one! Your belly can be obvious! Why don't you wear that skirt as I told you?

We're both in a mess This is only for the time being All the stuff here belongs to the landlord Does Grandpa know you're staying here? No Her mother... thinks she can jump on the chance She thinks we are a wealthy doctor's family Wealthy! The money belongs to your Grandpa but not me She's silly, too Came to our house with her mother With all the make-up and everything! So, I told her frankly You want to get married? Fine Make one thing perfectly clear to your mom Don't ever think of getting a penny out of us! Even if I allow it your Grandpa won't I'm always a black sheep in your Grandpa's eyes anyway The grooms, the brides, ladies and gentlemen Today, Mr. Liu Chang-ming and Ms. Lin Pi-yun, Mr. Chen Wu-ling and Ms. Lee Li-chung are having notarial weddings in this court Marriage is the most important event in life Family is the foundation of our society Families are building rocks of a nation Our ancestors told us The order of the world starts from the order of a family Today, the court conducts wedding ceremonies for you newlyweds It marks the beginning of a new life for each of you I wish you would be in harmony Respect each other and trust each other Help each other and create a happy family It is the same effort you devote in creating a greater society Face each other Step back a bit First bow Second bow Third bow Dear Mom and Dad, The noise of the crickets disturbs me a lot Every time the train rumbles pass my window, I feel saddened I was the only family at Uncle's wedding Aunt Lin didn't have a wedding gown She didn't look as pretty as mom in mom's wedding album Poor uncle No one dares to mention his name in front of Grandpa I seem to have lost him all of a sudden If Grandpa and Grandma had attended his wedding Uncle would have been so much happier So many things happen each day that I can't keep tracks I'll tell you later if they come back to my mind I feel depressed today I'll stop for now Wish mommy recover soon Love, Tung-tung Doctor Liu! Officer Lee, have a seat! Thanks Officer Lee Sorry to bother you What's up? Remember the taxi driver who got beaten under the flyover? Do you have his address? I have to make a record of it Sure Ah-hung, get me the records Did you get those rubbers? Not yet. But we found out who they are and the news is in the papers Some other driver came to report a robbery saying... One of the rubbers hurt himself during the robbery It's in the papers Right here Uncle! Uncle! Who are you looking for? Chang-ming What? They are beating up Tung-tung by the creek! Big Head! Big Head! He's my nephew! Tung-tung He ran as soon as he saw us. He recognized us Your pictures are in the papers Who doesn't? Tung-tung, after you get back Tung-tung, don't tell anyone They broke the law, but we grew up together I must help them out Understand? The Old St., Fu-shing Rd. No. 3, My son's place Right... right... My grandson ran into them when he visited They really frightened the boy No... Have some tea Certainly... Certainly... Who? The landowner Don't move Since when did they hide at your place? Did they mention where they were going? Say something! Did they head for Taipei for Big Head's sister? Did they threaten you? Don't be afraid. Speak out! If you don't tell us, I'd just have to arrest you Speak up! Say something... You treat them as buddies, but they won't do the same Once they are caught, They'll drag you into this mess Say something Take the medicine at the pharmacy over there Tung-tung, Tung-tung Tung-tung, Tung-tung Be quiet! Tung-tung. Tung-tung Tung-tung. Tung-tung What? This little bird is injured It's dead What should I do with it? Throw it into the river. Let it be carried away Then it can reincarnate. Stupid! Hey... Wait a second Oh, Kwang-ling, it's you How could this possibly happen... Well... you take care of yourself Hwei-cheng became allergic to the aesthetic She hasn't waken up for 3 hours after the operation How could it happen? I haven't got the details yet Once he gets the news, he'll call me Wait... I'd better call the head doctor first Director Lin It's useless for you to go. You'll bother Kwuang-ling I just called the head doctor Hwei-cheng is too weak physically It depends on whether she'll come around this evening He'll phone us any time It will be better if there's extra helper Besides, if I stay here, I'll go crazy Well, you pack then... I'll tell Ah-hung to buy the train tickets My little bird is dead Tung-tung said it'll come alive if it is thrown into the water Go away! Don't you listen to me? Go! Go! Go away! Go! It's your fault Went looking for Dim-ma Now Grandpa can't go to Taipei to see mom Mom is seriously ill, you know? Where are you going? Don't you listen to me? Go to bed! Your mother is very disappointed at you, you know? Mom, I'll bring her to bed later I've never seen such a dogged kid Why are you sitting up? Go to bed! Don't sit here! I want to stay up for the call from Mom I'll wake you up when she calls, OK? Hurry up! Go to bed! None of you kids listens to the elders nowadays! Dear Mom and Dad... I fell to sleep when I waited for the call I didn't hear the phone ring Grandma promised to wake me up, but she didn't I was so angry! However, I'm happy to hear that Mom is getting well I wish Mom healthy and pretty forever Uncle got out of jail Grandma told me it was grandpa who bailed him out Grandpa is so weird. He never tells others what he did Auntie told me Han-tzu lost her baby Grandpa tried to save it... ...even when Mom was in coma But Han-tzu's father was mad at Grandpa I feel sorry for Grandpa Grandma said she's sorry for Han-tzu's father I really can't tell why It's better to have her sterilized this time Why don't you mind your own business! I'm grateful for your advice... But I'm getting old, I can't take care of her for the rest of my life Once she has a baby, she won't run around so often She'll then stay home and take care of her baby People like Han-tzu are unfortunate Perhaps she doesn't realize this herself Her father is even more unfortunate For her misfortunes stay with him as long as he lives No one can take care of his children forever The only thing a parent can do is to provide the children a sound fundamentality before they step into the society Teach them the basic qualities of becoming a decent individual I didn't quite understand what Grandpa was saying But I was sure Grandpa was referring to uncle Time flies. The summer is almost gone I'm homesick When will Dad come and pick us home? My hand is getting sore from writing I'll stop for now Love, Tung-tung Uncle! Uncle! Grandpa is here! What's the matter? He was operated for hemorrhoids It hurts whenever the muscle contracts Grandpa Papa Your sister had an operation The gall flew out It was very dangerous, but it's ok now Tung-tung will go to the orientation course in Taipei Think about when you can drive him home Goodbye, uncle Uncle! Auntie! Han-tzu! Ting-ting, hurry up! Get in the car, Ting-ting! Drive carefully! I know Be good Goodbye Grandmother Kuo, Trouble Lou, Goodbye! Bye! Bye! I'm leaving for Taipei. So long! So long! I'll be back. So long! So long! Dad, they are ashamed They all swam nakedly Really. I'll come back!
