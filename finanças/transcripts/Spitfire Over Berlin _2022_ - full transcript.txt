Hah, nice to see you too Jerry. How are you holding up, Georgie? I'll make this quick. You're not looking too good yourself. Almost there. Let's go! You up for a bit of fun, Georgie? Hang on. Charlie one niner niner two to Tower. Charlie one niner niner two this is Tower. Glad to see you back. Glad to be back. I see you've laid on some good weather for us. Ah, you know me, friends in high places. Who would that be? God or Churchill? That would be the FÃ¼hrer, one niner niner two. Making my final approach. Roger that. - Ed. - Afternoon, Stan. Good flight? Walk in the park, Lofty. But you'd know that. You must be able to see the Eiffel Tower from here. A little further on a clear day. 'Ey, enough chit chat, lad. Get under there and check those tires. And mind your head. You know, when the war's over, you two should think about starting a double act. The handsome bastard and the lanky twat. Augh! Group Captain's looking for you. The Group Captain? Yeah, he wants a word. He's waiting for you in the Briefing Room. Right... Well that'll be me in the shit again. Oh! Take a look at the camera system will you? It packed in while I was over La Rochelle. Yeah, will do! Sir. At ease. You wanted to see me, sir? I have another job for you. Sir? I know you've only just got back, but it's a big one and you're the only pilot available. I'm ready, sir. The Eighth Air force are planning a large-scale attack on an industrial complex here in West Berlin. They believe the Germans have a gap in their air defenses and if they strike tomorrow, they can seriously undermine German supply lines. But they're wrong. In truth, the Yanks are flying into a trap. And, if things are as bad as we're being led to believe, then tomorrow over a thousand airmen will fly to their deaths. With all due respect, sir, I don't understand. The Americans' intelligence is out of date. Sources on the ground report the Germans have poured Eighty-Eights into the area. But without concrete evidence, the Yanks are going ahead with the mission tomorrow as planned. That's why I need you. Fly in, take the photos and get the hell out. Questions? No, sir. Everything you need is here on this desk, so get yourself acquainted. Clock's ticking and we only have one shot at this. Be back by twenty hundred hours at the latest. Understood? Sir. Good Luck. Thank you. Took a look at the camera system, Ed. Everything seemed fine. Nothing out the ordinary. Alright, very good. See you on the other side. Charlie one niner niner two to Tower. Radio check. Tower to Charlie one niner niner two. I hear you loud and clear. Wasn't expecting to see you again so soon. No rest for the wicked. Same client as usual? No, Americans this time. Normandy? Somewhere new. Your friend in high places will know it well. Stand clear! The Berlin express is ready for takeoff! Roger that. You are clear for takeoff. Ready, Georgie? Christ! What do you think? Five and a half hours. That should work out alright. Have a coffee now, another in an hour, and then the rest on the way home. Ah, sod it, I'll just have a little one. Well, if I end up needing a piss, I'll just make sure I do it over Jerry. That hits the spot. You know, it's a pity we didn't bring any biscuits. Where did you pilfer those from? I don't mind if I do. What am I doing? I almost forgot to dunk. You know, you certainly know a way to a man's heart. Shit! And what are you looking at? You know the best thing about this job, Georgie? It's not the views at fifteen thousand feet. Or flying the most beautiful aircraft in the world. The best thing about this job, it's just you and me. No one else getting in the way. What is that behind us, Red Three? I believe it's Red Two, Flight Leader. Funny, you could almost mistake him for Jerry back there. You could, Red Leader. I would like to report a Spitfire on our starboard side, Skipper. Glad you could join us, Red Two. Tell me, is that your Spitfire? Service log read property of Edward Barnes, does it? No, sir. Then it won't be you paying for any repairs when you damage it, will it, Red Two? Another display like that and I'll pull you off my flight. Suits me. P-p-p-p-p-p-pedal? Um... P-p-p-p-plane? No. Right... P-p-p-p-parachute? I knew it! Alright, my turn. I spy with my little eye something beginning with C. Nope. No. Car? Oh yeah, look there's an Austin Seven. Uh, nope. Give up? Cowling. That's perfectly fair. Well I can see it right there. Alright, I'll give you another one. Something beginning with B. No. Nope. No. Do you want a clue? Three two eight one eight, this is Spitfire Charlie one niner niner two. Do you copy? Hello, Charlie one niner niner two. We see you. How are you holding up? Okay. She's a little beat up, but nothing we can't handle. What's your prognosis? I've seen worse. Good to hear. So tell me, what's a little Spitfire doing all the way out here? It's always about size with you Yanks. I'm on my way to West Berlin, what about you? We just came from East. Gave us a proper shellacking, but we softened them up pretty good. I don't expect they'll give you too much trouble. Good. Otherwise I'll be paying you a visit. Sure thing. How's your crew? Fine. How's your Rear Gunner? Three two eight one eight, can you hear me? He'll be okay. Where are you crossing? Didn't catch that, Charlie one niner niner two. Where are you crossing into England? I'll give you coordinates to the closest airfield. Thanks Limey, but we'll be alright. You take care of yourself. You too. Oh, shit! Fire! Fire! Extinguishing. Pull up! Bail out! Go now! Come on! Please, please, please, please, please! Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck! Please! Please, come on! Come on! Come on! Come on. I... I don't know. I didn't see any. No. No chutes. We should keep going. If someone got out, they'll be picked up. There's nothing we can do, Georgie! That's it. There's no second chances, that's how it works. And don't you bloody start. You've got no right. I'm going fucking mad. I'm going fucking mad. Three two eight one eight, is that you? Three two... Three two eight one eight, this is Spitfire Charlie one niner niner two, do you copy? Three two eight one eight, can you hear me? Three two eight one eight, are you receiving? Three two eight one... Control to Flight Leader. Control, this is Flight Leader. Alter heading to south, south west. You're to provide cover for our boys falling back to Dunkirk. Over. Roger Control, altering heading to south, south west. Out. Why only send a flight? I guess they're waiting until Jerry sets his sights on home. There's no point having an Air Force if there's no Army left to speak of. It'll be the Luftwaffe that'll come at us first and we'll need every Hurricane and Spitfire we can lay our hands on. I just don't see what use we're going to be. Any support we can give our boys gives them better odds. I don't like the look of those odds. It's not our job to make the decisions, Edward. It's our job to follow orders and make the best of it. So, let's make every bullet count and give our boys the best chance we can. Alright Red Section, radio silence until we have visual. Keep it tight. Softened them up, my arse! Come on. Useless bloody thing. Come on! Work, damn it! Will you give a man a break, Jerry! Work, damn you! That's it. That's it! Stay! Bugger! We haven't got a choice. We can't go back empty handed. If it gets jammed up again, at least we know we've done all we can. There's over a thousand lives at stake, Georgie, I can't have that on my conscience. We're here, we have plenty of fuel, we give it another go. No buts. We make the best of it. Don't! That's not going to happen to me. I'll make it through. Let's make this count. Ah, thank Christ. It's fine. We're almost there. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Okay. Okay. Come on. Come on. Come on. Stay awake. Come on. Stukas, ten o'clock low. I see them, Red Three. There's loads of the buggers. We engage on my mark. Remember, Edward, it's all about putting yourself in the other man's shoes. What would he do next? I know. This isn't the same as in training Eddie. The adrenaline's gonna kick in and its going to make you jumpy. Panic and you're gonna end up getting yourself or somebody else killed. Do you understand? Yes. This is life and death now, Eddie. The rounds in those machine guns will cut you in half. Alright boys, we've got enough fuel for twenty minutes. Keep an eye out for the escort. Let's make it count. Break! You can do it. Come on, girl! Pull up! Shit! Ready? One. Two. It's about that time again, Georgie. Or maybe not. Bleeding's slowing. So that's a good sign. Do you think they'll let me fly again? They let Bader with no legs... They have to let me fly, right? I can't lose my wings. I don't know what I'd do. Georgie? Georgie? What the...? I'm trying. What are you? One-oh-nine. Why are you not using your cannon? I think you're right. He's spent. He must've used it up on the Yanks. I think his machine gun's low, too. Nine, ten seconds left. I just need to keep you off our backs until you're empty. One. Two, three. Four. Four and a half. Five. I see him. Six. Seven, eight. I know! Let's see how good a pilot he really is. He'll pull up. Okay. I think we're good. Cheeky fucker. Georgie? Georgie! No, no, no, no, no! Georgie! You come to gloat? If only you were here, you would have done things differently. You would have known what to do. Of course you would've. I messed up. Is that what you want to hear? Because I've done quite alright without you. I always would have. I never needed you to fight for me, or make excuses for me. Not with Mum and Dad, not at school and not when I joined your Squadron. It's time you realize I can stand on my own two feet. But even now you've gone, you've still got to stick your oar in. Just like you did that day. Edward's big brother to the rescue. I had it covered. But you had to step in. The escort's arrived. Christ! Keep it together, Edward. Take it easy. On your tail, Red Two! I'm on him. There's one on you, Red Three. Hang in there, Red Three. - Bail out! - I can't. Bail out! I can't! I'm on fire! No! There's one on my tail! When I say, pull up. Now! Shit! I'm out. I'll lose him in the sun. What are you doing, David? Go! David? David, are you there? David. I can't, I can't, I can't. Good to see you, Limey. How? How are you here? Managed to right the old bird. We're a little low power, as you can see, but we're getting there. I saw you fall out the sky. Yet here we are. Wait, no. Don't you worry about how we got here. Just worry about yourself, Limey. How are things with you? Not good. How come? My legs are fucked. What are you gonna to do? I don't know. You gonna give up? No. I don't understand how you're here. From the sounds of it, you know what you're gonna do. - But... - -You're gonna fix yourself up, set a course for Fairmarsh, and land that son of a bitch. I can't. Sure you can. You've got all the help you need, Limey. Wait, how? How do you know where I'm stationed? I never said... Do you copy, three two eight one eight? Oh, Christ! David. I'm so sorry. It's been so fucking hard. You saved me. I know that. But not a day goes by that I wish you hadn't. Truth is... Truth is, I still need saving. I wish I hadn't shut you out. Christ. Okay. Okay. On three. One. Two. Three. Okay. Let's do this. Charlie one niner niner two, is that you? This is Charlie one niner niner two. Am I glad to hear you, Tower. A little later than expected. We weren't sure if you were going to show up. I ran into a little bother. I'm gonna need medical assistance once I've landed. Copy that. I'll let emergency crews know. You're clear for landing. Thank you, Tower. Tower, my landing gear won't deploy. Attempting to lower gear manually. Roger. Tower, can you see anything? Negative, Charlie one niner niner two. Shit. Come on. Why won't you lower? Come on. What is it? No, no, no! Please. Please. Tower, can you see anything? Uh, still nothing. Fuck. I'm out of options. Sorry, Charlie one niner niner two, can you repeat that? I'm coming in wheels up. Roget that, we're on standby. Good luck, Edward. Tower, I was coming in too hot. I'm going around again. Roger. Charlie one niner niner two, can you hear me? Charlie one niner niner two, do you copy? Edward? Edward, can you hear me? I'm here. I'm here. Hold tight. Emergency crews are almost there. Come on. It's jammed! Lofty, around the back. Come on, come on, come on! Stand back! Come on, Ed. Come on, Ed. Watch his leg. Wait, the film. No wait. - No, you're alright, you're alright, it's fine. - -Stop, stop. The film's still in the plane. - No, you're fine. - Stop, stop! Listen, listen to me! Ed. Ed! She is gonna blow! The film! It's still in the fucking plane. Go, go, go! Come on! Flight Lieutenant. - Sir. - As you were. How's the leg treating you? It's fine, sir. Ready to get back to work. Good to know. Those American airmen will never know it, but they owe you their lives. Well done. You and your family should be very proud. Yes, sir. I've put you forward for a DFC. Congratulations. Thank you, sir. Where are you off to now? Frankfurt. Try and bring her back in one piece this time, will you? Yes, sir. She's all yours. Charlie one niner niner two to Tower, radio check. Tower to Charlie one niner niner two, good morning. Good to hear you, Tower. I hope you put in a good word with your friend in high places. It's taken care of. Stand clear! How's the new co-pilot treating you, one niner niner two? Very well. Glad to hear. You are clear for takeoff. Thank you. You ready, David?
