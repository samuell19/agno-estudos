Let's go! Lift those knees! Lift those knees, everybody! You're not senior citizens! You're young and fit. Let's go! I see you in the back! Jumping jacks! All together! Let's go! You can do it! Pick up the jump rope in five, four, three, two, two, two, one... Jump rope! Like a boxer! That's it. Jump rope. Use your arms! Juliette! I'm talking to you! Arms, arms, arms! Drop the jump rope in three, two, one. Drop the jump rope. Football! Move those legs! Push! Push! Push! Juliette, I'm watching you! Let's go! JEUNE JULIETTE Don't you think that whatever people say is boring? Yeah, totally. All the time, actually. Who at school is interesting? You. Other than me and you. I don't know. Some of the teachers, maybe. Yeah, but if you had any ambition, would you be a teacher here? No. Maybe some of the seniors are cool. I think it's the opposite. The longer you're here, the dumber you get. - Fuck it, man! - Yeah, man! - Fuck French! - We're outta here! - No more shitty teachers! - Yes! "Class notes. Grade 9 French." They should wait till exams are done before tearing up their notes. They don't exactly seem like Einsteins. Kids will be kids. Five, four, three, two, one. - Hey! - Hey! I'm late too. Good afternoon, everyone! As you know, the countdown to the end of classes has begun. Yeah, yeah. OK! Much to the delight of some, including myself, the school year ends in 24 days, two hours and 59 minutes. On Thursday, we'll be hosting Grade 6 students for the open house. Don't forget, you were in their shoes not so long ago. Back then, my students welcomed you... OPEN HOUSE OPEN HEARTS ...with open hearts. You'll each be paired with a sixth-grade student. One of them is a bit different. He's a sweet kid. He just needs a little more patience and love. That's why, if she's willing, I'd like to ask our most mature student to look after him. You know who I'm talking about: our hidden gem, our national treasure. She reassures me I'm not teaching in vain. Yeah, yeah. Her last essay is etched right here. Juliette, would you look after this special little boy during the open house? - Sure. - Great! Let's get to it. For a hidden gem, you're pretty visible. Whatever. Hey. Hey! Juliette, you OK? I didn't do anything. Sorry. Here. Are you all right? Yeah. Well, bye. Posture, young lady! All right. Dig in, kids! Thanks! Are you liking your book, sweetie? - How was your day? - Good. I called about the truck. The price was decent. I rented it for two days. Perfect. We'll load it Saturday and leave at night. Yeah. - When? - At the end of the month. Wow, that's soon. Aren't you excited to get me out of your hair? No, not really. Then put your book down and take a good look while I'm still here. You can take the big room. I don't want it. Why not, Juliette? So he can have it on the weekends. I'll be two hours away. With school, work, my girlfriend... I won't be back every weekend. OK. Dad, you'll have to get his room disinfected before I take it. Yeah? You can disinfect it yourself. I have to go. - Where? - Out with some friends. You'll understand when you get some! I'm just kidding. Have a good night! Léane, please. Thank you. Yo! Spaghetti. You? Yo! Burger. Lucky! - Hey, what the fuck? - I don't know. - Does that happen often? - No, never. How long was I unconscious for? I don't know, like, 30 seconds. Did a lot of people see? Ten at least. What did Liam do? Who? Liam! Your brother's friend? Nothing. I think he was gonna say something important before I passed out. Lélé, come do the dishes! We have a connection. - Huh? - Never mind. - I have to go. - OK, bye. Why are you wandering around like a lost soul, sweetie? Want a cookie to go with your milk? No, I'm not hungry. This is the hottest June we've had in a while, huh? Do you have any plans for the summer? Like what? With your brother gone and me working, you'll be on your own. Yeah, yeah. I'll read and hang out with Léane. Do you want to sign up for summer camp? Ugh! Are you crazy? I was kind of a loner at your age too. Yeah, and you're so sociable now. You're always having friends over. It's dizzying. Dad? Yes? Do you think a guy could fall in love with me? Yeah, sure! What do you mean, "sure"? Well, one day, for sure. But not right away. I feel weird. How so? It's like I'm looking forward to something, but I don't know what that is. "Hi, Mom! "I hope you're doing well. I'm good. "Not much has happened since the last time I wrote. "School is still going well. I have good grades in all my classes. "Léane is still my best friend. "It's starting to get really hot here. "Dad says it's the hottest June we've ever had. "But I'm sure it's even hotter in New York. "How's work? I miss you a lot. "I was wondering if we could talk on the phone or on FaceTime soon. I love you. Good night. Juliette." Whatever. What do you know? Juliette, take that crappy Ed Sheeran song. You know how many times it was played last month? - Too many? - 21 times. That means at least once every lunch hour, except ours, and that some loser even played it several times in the same show. Wow! You're so clever! Read the request board once in a while. - Where are you going? - I forgot something in my locker. All right. Hurry up. Hurry! What are you doing this summer? - What do you mean? - I don't know. Are you going to camp or anything? - Are you joking? - Yeah. Did your dad get the trailer ready? Yeah. That's pretty much it for me this summer. I'll listen to music, eat and sleep in the trailer next to my house. - Sounds pretty nice. - Yeah. Are you gonna visit your mom? Yeah, probably for a couple weeks in August, as usual. Do you miss her sometimes? Not anymore. I did when I was young, though. What are you thinking? I'm wondering what would have happened if we hadn't become friends this year. It would have been hell. I probably would have dropped out. Me too. Hey! That's a bad sunburn! What did you do? We had gym class outside. Great! A little exercise is good for you. I'm going to see PL. Sorry, I thought you were studying. No worries. What's up? I skipped math and geography earlier. Cool! Can you answer the phone for the next 48 hours? Yeah. I'll answer. No problem. Sit down. - Really? - Yeah. Come on. Not so long ago, we were playing ninja. Now you skip class. You're all grown up. Not really. Seriously, PL. You have to get over that ancient movie! It's the coolest thing ever, man. You just don't get it. He's right. You have to get over it. Don't give my sister any. Of course not. You want some? Come on, man! You feeling better? Yeah. - Can I have a bite? - Yeah. Thanks. Munchies. "Dear Juliette, I think about you constantly. "There's something special in your eyes, "your face, your smile. "It's making me crazy. "I wish your brother and his girlfriend hadn't been there earlier. "I wanted to kiss you and touch you so badly. "Would you have let me? "You're not like everyone else. "I miss you already. Hugs and kisses. "I wish I could kiss you. Good night. Liam." - That's definitely him. - You're lucky. Seriously. He looks like the coolest one. Yeah, he's not uninteresting. Are you Arnaud? OK, no handshake? Great. I'm Arnaud. Arnaud Despins. You're Juliette Lamarre-Tremblay? Yeah. I play with this when I'm nervous. It happens a lot. You'll get a card at the beginning of the year. Grab some books, and I'll show you. Doesn't matter which ones. We're not really gonna borrow them. Go ahead. - Impressive! - Thanks. It's easy. You scan your card until the light turns green. Then you scan one book at a time and make sure it beeps. You're a little intense, aren't you? Yeah, I know. I can't really help it. I'm sorry. That's OK. I'll be more careful. So, one book at a time. Slowly. I like. Cool! If you want your own show, you have to sign up right away. It's in high demand. I don't think this is the kind of activity I'm interested in. Well, if you ever want to request a song, there's a board out there. It's kind of dumb, but there's an unwritten rule that you have to sit on the bottom steps. Only the older kids get to sit up top. - Hi, Arnaud! - Hi, Jessica! Your new boyfriend looks as cool as you are. Yeah, right. She seems nice. But why did she say that? I'm not your boyfriend. No, she's not nice. Why? What she's really saying is, one, I'll never have a boyfriend, ever, two, I'm not cool, and three, neither are you. - But why is she so mean? - Because people are mean. No. Everyone's nice to me at school. Good for you! But that'll change next year. So? He's a bit spacey, but he's sweet. Yours? She wants to start a cheerleading team and be on the dance organizing committee. She's already talking about prom. You know the type. Nice! Hang on a second. What's your problem? What did he ever do to you? He needs it! Take that! All right, what's going on here? Here. I'll never forget this. OK, get up. Juliette? This sauce is really good. Thanks. It's for me. Hello? Speaking. Absolutely. Yes. Yes, that's right. At the optometrist. Great! Thank you very much. Bye. - Who was that? - Julie. I'm going with her to her appointment tomorrow. It was the school secretary calling to see where you were Wednesday afternoon. You pretended to be me, and instead of saying she was in the park with Léane getting a sunburn, you said she had an appointment at the optometrist. Gotcha! I'm still your dad. How'd you figure it out? Years of practice. It's Friday, so I won't punish you. And you're such bad liars, it's almost charming. So, I met someone online. It's about time! - When? - About three months ago. I'm a better liar than you two, huh? Her name is Malaika. I might introduce you to her if you're good. Love the name. Yeah. It means "love" in Swahili. And as it happens, we're in love. Congrats! I think Liam is into me. Oh yeah? Why? I can feel it. - But you never hang out. - We do sometimes. Read this. "Juliette, I think about you constantly. "Can we meet up, just the two of us? "I want to kiss you, touch you. "Don't be afraid. I'll take good care of you. "You're so pretty. "You have the most beautiful eyes I've ever seen. "Kissing you all over... Liam." He's not as dumb as I thought. - You do have beautiful eyes. - Thanks. Didn't he repeat Grade 10? There were no mistakes. Impressive. I hadn't noticed. He's handsome, isn't he? He looks like a wilted onion. He's pallid. Who do you think is cute? No one. They're all idiots. 02:45. You could get dressed, you know. It's Saturday. - Hello! - Hello! Sorry to barge in. - Are you Juliette? - Yes. Good! Hi! You made a real impression on my son at the open house! - Really? Arnaud? - Yes. Would you like to babysit a couple days a week this summer? Go for it! It'd be a nice little job for you. Yes, I'm interested. Does it pay? Come on! How about $6 an hour? - That's perfect. - Great! Come by the house tomorrow at noon. I'll tell you all about my beautiful boy! The house across from the convenience store. $6 an hour! Soon, you'll be able to pay me rent. No. I can get whatever I want? Yeah. Your mom gave me enough money for both of us. So... You finally made a friend! That's right. What do you want, Arnaud? A small strawberry cone, please. Could you please use a clean spoon? That one's gross. Sure. I'll have a large chocolate soft serve dipped in chocolate. Not great for your figure! - What's up with his voice? - I don't know. I think he's turning into a monster. 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30! That's crazy! Thanks. Thanks, darling! I'd like to raise a glass to Malaika. Welcome to the family! Thanks, Papi! "Papi!" Come on! It's so nice to meet you all. I'm starting yoga. It's gonna work miracles. Malaika teaches yoga. Really? I'd like to learn. I'd be happy to teach you. Are you girls interested? Not really. It's not our thing. I teach dance too. So, Julie, you're dating Pierre-Luc, right? Yes. - For how long? - Almost two years. They're pretty serious for their age. And you two? What? How long has it been? We're not dating! Jeez! I'm sorry. I don't know why I thought that. I was trying too hard to be cool. We've been friends for a year. But it's been intense. I wouldn't say "intense." And you, Liam? No boyfriend, no girlfriend. I'm all by myself. Not even a crush? No. Is the water cold? No. It's perfect. I started writing back to Liam. Oh yeah? I'm gonna tell him that I want to be alone with him. - Do you love him? - Yeah. OK. See you tomorrow. See you. We've got French first period. Juliette? Juliette, I'm going to kiss you. Why did you do that? Because I love you. I'm in love with you. No. You like girls? Didn't you get that? No! Why are you doing this? You're ruining everything! I can't help it. I love Liam. I don't love you. I never will. - You OK, peanut? - Yeah. Hi, Juliette! Hi, Mom! I just wanted to talk to you. Your new house looks nice. It's an apartment. You like it? Yeah. What neighbourhood is it in? The East Village. I know where that is. Yes, we came here together. I was wondering if you got my email the other day. Of course I did! I was so happy to hear from you. I was going to write back this weekend, but I've been so busy. We have a big trial coming up. Really? What is it? It's complicated. It involves kids without papers trying to attend school in the US. You're helping them? We're trying. We're working hard, anyway. Oh yeah, I have a question. Do you think a guy could ever fall in love with me? Of course! Do you have someone in mind? No. Oh yeah, and... I also wanted to tell you that if I ever came to live with you, I'd be really good. I'd never get mad and I'd help clean the apartment. Oh yeah? Yeah. You wouldn't even know I'm there. Well, barely. I'd run your baths and rub your back to help you fall asleep. You're gonna make me cry, Juliette. You miss me, huh? Yeah. I miss you too. I'm excited for August. You? Yeah. I can't wait. Goodnight, Mom. Goodnight. Let's talk soon, OK? Yeah. Good morning! Looks like we're missing someone. Juliette, do you know where Léane is? No. Well, let's hope she's OK. Today, we'll do a review for your final grammar exam, which you'll all pass with flying colors, despite your numerous shortcomings. Sorry. My bad! Your fat ass isn't in the way. It's your book. Come on! Pick up your book, you fat cow! Lard-ass! Jesus! You're there? Sorry to interrupt. You're not interrupting. I'm glad you're here. This stuff is impossible. Malaika will be proud of you. That's the idea. Did you like her? She's fine. Dad... Yes? When did I get fat? Fat? Don't you mean "plump"? When did I get plump? You started gaining a little weight when you were 7 or 8. The year Judith left. But why? You were sad, and you ate too many cookies and... Now I think you've developed the habit of eating when you're sad. Why did she leave? She wanted to live a different life. It's not about us. It's about her. I don't think I realized I was fat until today. What happened today? Someone just told me I was. Thanks for coming with me. No problem. It's nice to have a friend. We're moving on to the dance competition, ladies and gentlemen! Get ready, the 8-to-10 age group will be performing on the main stage. And don't forget about the 50/50 draw! We've sold a lot of tickets already. Let's keep that momentum going! Everybody's really cool here. I know, right? But I don't approve of the video game competition. It's not very serious. I don't approve of any of this. Good luck! May the best one win! Hi! Hey! What are you competing in? I'm not competing. So you're here for your friend? He's not my friend. I'm babysitting. Like a summer job. He's here for the Rubik's Cube. Arnaud Despins. Cool! Here. - You're babysitting me? - Yeah. - My mom gives you money? - Yes. But... I thought we were friends. Are we gonna be friends when I get to high school? How should I know? I'm probably moving to New York soon, anyway. New York? Then who's gonna be my friend at school? Your friend? Enough with that! I get teased enough as it is. I'm not hanging out with a little retard! I'm not retarded! I'm the opposite of retarded! It's now time for the Rubik's Cube competition. Come take your seats. It's your turn. We'll be starting in less than ten seconds. Get ready! Three, two, one, go! An unexpected defeat for Arnaud Despins, the projected winner. He's freaking out! I hate you, Juliette Lamarre-Tremblay! I hate you! Arnaud? Stay there, Arnaud. I ran into him at the mall. He was all alone. Are you crazy? What were you thinking? You can't leave him alone. He could have followed anyone. The world is a dangerous place for him. You understand? Yeah. - So what's your problem? - He ran off. Then you should have run after him! Arnaud isn't like everyone else. He's different. I'm different too. How? Do you have Asperger's? ADHD? OCD? You think you're different? Ease up on the ice cream. It'll work miracles. Hey! Yes? Can I chill with you guys? Yeah, sure. What is it? I don't know, man! I can't stop! My jaw hurts! - Are you laughing at me? - Not at all. Go to bed, Ju. It's late. Ju! Ju, wait! Time's up, Juliette. Looking forward to reading it, as always. I couldn't really focus. I don't think it's very good. What's up? I have no friends and nobody likes me. I like you. - You like me? - The way a teacher likes a student, yes. Great! No one likes me, aside from my teacher, a lesbian and a 12-year-old boy. That's pretty good. Well, even they don't like me anymore. Learn to like the people who like you and stop chasing the ones who never will. You've got it all, Juliette. Here, here, here. You're not getting my pity too. Papi! Hey, kids! We're going on a yoga retreat in the Sandbanks this weekend. No! Not you guys. Just me and Malaika. Pierre-Luc, you'll be the man of the house. No problem. Juliette, you'll be the woman of the house? Sure. And, Juliette, Arnaud's mother called. Not your finest moment. He's the one who ran off. What did you do to make him run off? Nothing. It's not my fault he's a retard. Hey! And why haven't we seen Léane around lately? How should I know? Why is everything always my fault? Everything sucks here. It's suffocating. Our house sucks. Our stuff is ugly. We don't have any nice things! I still have a flip phone! We have no class! We always eat boring food. I've never even had an oyster! No one reads here! No one's heard of Dostoyevsky. No one's heard of Céline! Of course we've heard of Céline! Not the singer! The writer! I obviously don't belong here. God made a mistake or something. Everything is ugly and small. Our clothes are ugly. Our pool is ugly. The water is dirty. Mom left because we're losers. And Malaika's gonna leave too when she realizes we're losers. We're losers! - Where are you going? - Out! - Be home by 10:00, Juliette. - Fine. Hi, Juliette! Hi! Is Léane home? No, she went to a party. I thought you'd be there too. - Where is it? - At Vanessa's, down the block. OK, thanks. Move! - You OK? - Fuck off! Hey. Hey. This party sucks, huh? It's not so bad. Oh no! The fat cow is here! You're so ugly! What the hell are you doing here? Who invited you? You can't talk to me that way. Oh really? Just watch, you fat cow. Fat cow! Fat cow! I'm leaving. Have a good night! "Hi, Mom. "I'm going to take the train to New York as soon as school is over. "There's nothing keeping me here anymore. "I think I understand how you felt when you left. "I can't live here anymore. It's too small. "I've decided to lose some weight. You'll like the new me. "I love you so much. I can't wait to see you, Juliette." I'm sorry, Arnaud. Jesus! I just want to be alone. I had a bad night. Yeah, well, Malaika left. Where'd she go? To her house, I imagine. - You guys got in a fight? - Yeah. - Because of me? - Not at all. The world doesn't revolve around you, you know. The sooner you realize that, the better you'll feel, I swear. She was so cool with your tantrum, she wants to have kids with me. Jesus! You don't want any more kids? Why not? Because I'm old! You're not that old. Just tell her you might want more kids, but not right away. Yeah... I wouldn't mind having a little sister. I'd make sure she doesn't turn out as dumb as everyone else. It can be hard sometimes to take care of you two alone. But you love us most of the time? I love you all of the time. Do you think I'm a fat cow? Not at all. And I'll kill the little shit who called you that. Tomorrow. I've corrected your essays. Most of them were terrible. Still, most of you passed. Let's say you're being rewarded for your effort. There were exceptions. I'd like to read you a particularly lovely excerpt. Here goes... "I live my life like a caterpillar. "My food is bland. My colors are dull. "Mostly, I just stare at the ground. "You can't look up at the sky without a neck. "You can't look up at the sky without a neck. "I move slowly, "endlessly and absurdly bending my entire body. "I move without grace. "I slink along walls, foolishly hoping you won't see me. "I know I'm just asking to be crushed, with a horrible sound. And that's the end for me. That's the end of the caterpillar." What the fuck? If you don't understand, just be quiet. "But you won't get the better of me. "I tell myself you only knew me as a caterpillar. "Your eyes aren't ready to see me as a butterfly. "And throughout the world, "people will fall in love with my big, majestic wings. "My colors will be so bright, they'll burn your wrinkled eyes. Your wrinkled eyes." So, kudos to the person who wrote those lines. Yes, bravo! Thank you, Juliette. You can get down. Strike! Strike two! Juliette, can you at least try to hit the ball? No surprise there! Strike three. You have to aim for the ball. Anyway, let's switch it up! Come on! Léane? Yes? I'm sorry. Me too. Can we just go back to quietly judging everyone? Yeah. Let's go! That's it! Come on, girls! Pick it up! Juliette! Let's go! You OK, big guy? No thanks. I'm trying to lose weight. I think you look just fine. Thanks. I think it's fine that you like girls. But are we cool? I'm over it. I'd rather just be friends. You have some serious flaws, you know. I know! Have you told your parents? Yeah. They're cool with it. I'm more worried about school. Do I have to come out to everyone? We can just announce it on our radio show. Oh yeah! My dad is going on a yoga retreat this weekend. With the sexy bohemian? Obviously her idea. We could have a party while they're gone. Oh yeah? Who would we invite? I don't know. Everyone. I can say my goodbyes then. What? I'm going to live with my mom in New York. Live? You'd go to school there? Well, yeah. I'm not dropping out in Grade 8. When are you leaving? After our last exam. Is this for sure? Pretty much. I'll miss it here, but I think New York suits my personality more. It feels more like my town. OK, everyone. Here's an invitation you weren't expecting. A large soirée will soon be held at the Lamarre-Tremblay home. You're all kindly invited. We care little that you are all cretins. We wish for revelry! In layman's terms, party at Juliette and PL's, Friday night! Bring your own booze! I repeat, party at Juliette's! If you're not DJing, we're in. Cool! What the fuck? Are you crazy? Yeah. Hey! - Can you give me a hand? - Sure. Thanks for the other night. - What for? - I worked things out with Malaika. We're going on the retreat. Wow! You're really taking this to heart! I'm just happy for you guys. - So, is she pregnant? - No, no. I think that topic's off the table for a couple of months. You're pretty good with people. Thanks. - Shit! You look like a girl! - Thanks! You don't. I'm worried no one's gonna come. - It's lit! - Yeah! Yo, everybody! Welcome to the Lamarre-Tremblays! Tonight, the beat is gonna drop! I want to see you jump like fucking kangaroos! Pot brownies! Free pot brownies! Girls! Nice party, for real. Yeah. Have a beer! Are you OK? Yeah! If you're gonna spew, spew into this. - I found vodka! - Let's down it! Body shots? I don't know whose house this is, but it's nice! It's the fat cow's house. I wanted to tell you... that I really love you and your family. Thanks. I love you too. Please... You said you'd only touch me if I let you. No, no. Liam never wrote me any letters. I wrote them myself. Yeah, I know. You're not mad? No. You're my friend, and I love you the way you are. I like that you're kind of a fabulous liar. You can't spell "fabulous" without BS! Who was the girl by the pool? Just a girl. She's pretty. She seemed cool. We kissed last night. You and Liam? Yeah. We even slept in the same bed. What? Do you believe me? Yeah. It sounds true. Yeah. It is true. Arnaud! I'm so happy to see you! My mom says you're a mean and cruel person and that I shouldn't hang out with you anymore. Your mom's pretty intense, huh? But it's true that I was mean. Do you think you can forgive me? - I'll have to think about it. - I understand. Right now? Yes, I think I can forgive you. That's great news! But do you know when you're moving to New York? Well, now that I'm in a relationship, my plans are up in the air. You're in a relationship? That happened fast! Sometimes, these things happen fast. You'll understand when you're older. - Do I look OK? - You're perfect. Hi! Hey. I was excited to see you. Can I sit with you guys? Well, no. I thought we were dating. What? What are you talking about? This weekend, at the party... I don't know what you're talking about. But I love you. What the fuck? You're my friend's chubby little sister. I don't know how you could even think this would happen. Because I'm cool and smart, and I'm gonna have a good life. And you're gonna sling burgers at a McDonald's. Seriously, fuck off and die! What's going on, Juliette? I wanted to know if I should take a cab from the station on Saturday. Saturday? Yeah. I sent you a bunch of messages. All my stuff is ready. But, Juliette, I never agreed to that. I want to come live with you. We can talk about that happening sometime in the future. But this isn't a good time. I have to get back. When? I don't know! When you're done school, maybe. I can't do three more years at that school. It's full of idiots! Well, find the less idiotic kids and hang out with them. You take care of everyone's kids but your own. You're not my mother. Really? Do you know how much I send your father every month? Do you know how much money is in your college fund? One day, I'll pay it all back, so I won't owe you anything. What's going on? It's Mom. She sucks. You can't expect anything from Mom. Take what she gives you, but don't expect anything. OK? Take me with you to your new apartment. I don't like it here. Yes, you do. Growing up is scary, huh? No, it's all right. You coming outside? It's hot out. Welcome to ninja school, Juliette-san. You must complete three missions to get to the black temple of power. You know I'm not 7 anymore, right? The heart of a ninja never changes. Ten kicks, left leg, young Juliette. And never forget: Karate for defense only. Now. Harder. Harder! Yell. Nine more. Eight. Seven. Harder. Six. Harder! Five. No pain. Repeat after me! - No pain! - No pain! - No pain, Balboa! - No pain! No pain! - Come on! No pain! - No pain! No pain. Louder! - No pain! - No pain! Come. - What are you doing? - I'm done sitting down here. - Seriously? - Come! Excuse me. We want good seats for the show. - They're not very good, are they? - They're atrocious. I don't know what you see in him. Me neither. Léane, I'm going to kiss you, OK? Yes or no? Yes. I might not like you that way, but I like you a lot. And I want everyone to see. - To piss Liam off? - Yeah. Is that shitty? I think we're gonna do a lot of shitty things for love in our lives. Knock it off, you dykes! Get a room! - I like you a lot. - You too. Well, I guess I just came out. Thanks. Hang onto it, Papi. Easy there, kiddo! I've got all the weight. - Thanks, Juliette. - No problem. So, how many people came to your party last week, sweetie? My what? It was Léane's idea. Yeah... I'll propose a punishment soon. - How do you always know? - I'm a dad. I know everything. - Juliette! - What? - I'll miss you. - Me too. I've decided not to move to New York after all. Really? I think that's an excellent idea. So the three of us will be together at school next year? Yeah. - What made you change your mind? - A bunch of things. Obviously, my mom was disappointed, but I don't want to leave my dad. And I might have a little sister soon. She's gonna need me. This is where I belong, at least for now. But mostly, I want to stay for you guys. Next year, one step at a time, and we'll crush them all. THE END
