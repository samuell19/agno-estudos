(upbeat percussive music) (burgers sizzling) - Hold the ketchup and onion on that burger, medium well. - The ticket says well done. - He changed his mind. - I can't uncook a burger. - Table 12 is still waiting on steak fries. - AJ. - In the fryer. - Three specials. - We're out of the chicken salad. - It's still on the board. - Then erase it and push the steak. - Hey, Paul, some guy out front wants to talk to you. - I'm busy. Look, if it's a compliment, tell him I said thank you. If it's a complaint, AJ made the slaw. - You can't knock my slaw, dude. - Two chicken finger baskets, both with fries. - More fries. - Because they're the best. - Paul, your brother wants to talk to you. He looks upset. - My brother? - What, am I running a day care here? I got a dining room full of hungry customers, and this lump is blocking the kitchen door! - Lucas? - Get rid of him. - Hey, hey, you. Come over here. - I don't know how. - Just don't let anything burn. I'll be right back. Dude, what are you doing here? - Kevin's gone. I can't find him. - Gone? - He wandered out of the house. I don't know where he went. - Okay, how long has he been missing? - An hour, maybe two. Jordy was supposed to be watching him, but... - What's the matter with you? You never flipped a burger before? - No, sir. - Then why are you on my grill? And who are you anyways? - I'm Neil. You hired me yesterday. - Yeah, well you're fired today. Where's Royal? Royal! What are trying to do, burn down my restaurant, leaving Pampers here on the grill? - There's a problem at home. - Yeah, well, there's a tragedy at work. His name is Neil. - Am I really fired? - Just get back to the dishes, will you? - I'm a waiter. - I don't care if you're Mother Teresa. Do the dishes. - Look, I gotta go. My brother's in trouble. - The halfwit? - Don't call him that! - I'll be right back. Just call it my lunch break. - You're shift leader and cook. You can't take a break in the middle of a rush. Aw. - You go by True's and check Pine Street. I'll go by the garage and hit Penny Alley. Meet you back at Fifth. Look, I gotta go. - Yeah? Well don't bother coming back this time. (Paul sighing) (dramatic music) - Kevin! Kev? (dramatic music) Kevin! (dramatic music) Kevin? (dramatic music) (siren squawking) (radio chattering) (soft dramatic music) - Is he here? - [Paul] I don't know. - He ran right into me. - No, she swerved into my path. - No, no, no, no, no! - Kevin! - No no no, no no! - What is wrong with you? - Hey, hero, take it easy. - You just took off! (Kevin whimpering) How am I supposed to take care of you when you run off like that, huh? We're supposed to stick together. We're only safe when we're together. - One teaspoon baking powder. Two eggs. Sugar, sugar, we need the sugar. We need the sugar. I haven't got the sugar yet. - Hey, hey, Kevin, Kevin, Kevin, you're okay. Look at me, look at me. You're okay. You're okay, Kevin. - We're safe, we're safe? We're safe when we're together. - Yeah. Yeah, that's right. We're only safe when we're together. - We're safe when we're together. We're safe when we're together. - Come on, let's get you home. - We're safe when we're together. - You could have been killed, you moron. Stay out of the road! - We're safe when we're together. We're safe together. - You should put him on a leash next time. - We're safe when we're together. (door opening) - [Jordan] You found him? - One cup of butter. Sugar. We need sugar for the cookies. - Sugar, is that why he was out there? - He found Mom's recipe for sugar cookies. I told him we didn't have any sugar. - You know you have to be careful what you say around him. What'd you tell Mom? - Nothing, she's been asleep all afternoon. - Jordan is gonna make Mom's sugar cookies. - Take him up to the bathroom. Have him get cleaned up. You eaten anything? - Not yet. - [Rebecca] Mrs. Royal, this is Rebecca Howell, Jordan's counselor. I'm sorry I missed you at parent-teacher meeting last night. I'm really hoping we can reschedule. I'd like to talk with you about Jordan's focus in class. There are some issues that are concerning me, and I'm hopeful we can address them together. We can talk by phone if that's more convenient. (machine beeping) - [Woman] Yeah, this is Ronnie's Used Cars. Your check for the car payment came back for insufficient funds. I'll need the money order account no later than Thursday. (Paul sniffing) (Paul sighing) (jug thudding) - [Paul] Mom, you up? - [Peggy] Paulie, is that you? - [Paul] Yeah. - [Peggy] What time is it? - [Paul] It's about two. - [Peggy] In the morning? - [Paul] No, afternoon. - [Peggy] Oh, well how come you're not at the diner? - [Paul] Uh. It was slow. They let me off early. - [Peggy] Can you turn on a light? Get me my head pills, please, will you? They're in the bathroom on the sink. The red pills. (soft dramatic music) (footsteps padding) - [Paul] This one? It's empty. - [Peggy] Is there a refill? - [Paul] Yeah, there's one more. - [Peggy] Be a sweetie and take care of that for me, okay? - [Paul] Okay. Mom, Jordan's counselor called. She said she needs to talk to you. - [Peggy] Not now, sweetie, please. I have a terrible headache. Just, could you turn that light off? Oh. - [Paul] Mom, you really need to eat something before you take anything else. - [Peggy] Yeah, I'm not hungry. Just hurry back with those pills. Okay, sweetie, please. I need them. (soft music) - Royal, Peggy. (bell dinging) - This is the last refill on this one, and you'll need a new prescription to refill it again. Is that all? - Yeah. - All right, that's 20.25. - Our copay's only $5. - It went up last week. It's 15 now. (Paul sighing) - I don't have any change. I'll have to put the milk back. - I have a quarter right here. - All right. - Thanks. (bag rustling) (bell dinging) (Paul clearing throat) - What? - I'm sorry I took off. My brother, you know, he has some trouble sometimes. - Look, Paul, you been working here since you were what? - 15. - 15. And you've been a good worker. But lately, I can't rely on you. - Look, if you just let me, I wasn't trying to... - You're becoming a liability to me. And in this business, liabilities can cost you your restaurant. I mean, do you expect me to give up my restaurant for you? - No. - No, I can't do that. - Look, I need to be here. My mom, she can't work right now. So this job, it's all we got. - Okay, spare me the sad details. Look, I'll take you back, but as cook, not shift leader. - Cook? No, cook's get 12 an hour. I was getting 15. - If a cook has to leave, the shift leader can take over the grill. - I really need the 15. - What would the other cooks say if they found out you were making that kinda money? - I won't tell anybody. I swear. - It's cook, or nothing. That's it. Okay. You're opening tomorrow. Be here at five. - Yeah. - And don't be late this time. - [Man On TV] Get in the car then. You can't be late for your first day. - All right, show's over. Homework, then bed. Jordy, help me pick up these plates. Lucas, go check on Ma, see if she ate any of her dinner. - No, no, no, I need my plate. - Paul said we're done. - No, I'm not, I'm not done. I'm not finished with my dinner plate! - Kevin, you're finished. - Give it to me. - No, I need my plate. - You're making a mess. - I need. No, give it, give it, give it, no! - When I say you're done, that means you're done. You got that? - Stop it, you're hurting him! (Kevin screaming) (Kevin whimpering) - One teaspoon, one... One... one cup of flour, teaspoon of baking... - Kevin, Kevin, I'm sorry. - No no, no no. - I didn't mean to. I shouldn't have done that, Kev. - One teaspoon baking powder. - Kev. - One, no no. - Jordy, come back here. - One cup of sugar. - You can keep your plate as long as you want. - I need my dinner plate. - I'll clean him up. - No, I've got it. You go do your homework. (Kevin breathing hard) - One teaspoon. (Kevin whispering) (Kevin breathing hard) - For Ma? - She loves them. - Hey, where you going? - Study in the basement. Jordy locked himself in our room again. (Paul sighing) - Jordy, open up. - [Jordan] Go away. - What's going on with you? Counselor from school called, says you been acting weird. Look, if something's going on... - [Jordan] Quit pretending to be Dad. - We need to talk about it, Jordy. - [Jordan] I'm not talking to you. - Open this door, or I'm gonna bust it in. - [Jordan] Leave me alone. I hate you. - Jordy. - [Jordan] I hate this house and everyone in it. - No you don't. Don't say things like that. - [Jordan] I'm gonna go live with Dad. - We don't know where Dad is. - I'll find him. I hope he's on his way here right now to find me. Not you. Then I won't have to listen to you anymore. - You and me both. (phone dialing) (soft dramatic music) Hi, yeah, I saw you guys were looking for sous-chefs. No, I haven't been to culinary school yet, but I have been cooking professionally at a restaurant for two years. (soft piano music) No no, I know about the travel. That's what I love about it. (birds chirping) (soft piano music) (kids chattering) (horn honking) - What are you doing? - You going to the party at Trevor's? - Na. - You should. It'll be fun. - Come on, ride with us. Don't be shy. - Yeah, come on. We won't leave you all alone, promise. - I can't. I got stuff I gotta do here. - Well that's too bad. - Yeah, maybe next time. - Come on. Can't you believe what a loser he is? (girls laughing) (soft piano music) (birds singing) (soft piano music) (Lucas sighing) (soft dramatic music) (case hooks unlatching) (soft dramatic music) (Lucas strumming guitar) - C. G. (soft dramatic music) C. G. (soft dramatic music) (Lucas sighing) - [AJ] Hey, I just got it! - What did they say? - Dear Mr. Royal, thank you for submitting your application at Barton International Cruise Lines. We have reviewed your submission and would like you to come into the office for an interview! - Interview? - And they give a date and time, and some requirements for the interview. - Requirements? - You have to complete a pre-employment medical exam to make sure you're fit for duty. - Fit for duty. - You have to clear a background check, and you'll need a passport. - A passport, I hadn't thought about that. - Dude, you could end up traveling around the world. Italy, Greece, the Caribbean. - I'll be working with real chefs, man. And I can come back and open a restaurant with flavors from all around the world (laughs). - Yeah, just send me a postcard every once in a while, will you? - Hey. Hey, hey, why don't you come with me, man? You got the same experience as I do. What if we get on the same boat, huh? Think of that. Beaches and pretty ladies at every single port. - That sounds amazing, but I can't go anywhere. My grandma. - Yeah. Yeah, I hear you. You know, uh, Mom, she's feeling better. Soon, she'll be back up to work, and Luke is getting older, he can help her out with the kids, you know. I don't know, man. I can't keep doing this. I, I gotta get outta there. I gotta start doing something, you know? Passport, what do those things cost? - About 150 bucks. - Oh, you're kidding me. There's no way. I can't. - Don't sweat it. I'll loan you the money. And you can pay me out of your first paycheck. But in dollars, not in pesos or francs or anything fancy like that, Mr. International. - Dude. I don't know what to say. - Live it up for me, will you? - Is this really happening? I'm gonna travel the world. And then I'm gonna come back, and we, we're gonna open up a restaurant that's the best on the South Side. That money makes you a business partner, you know. - Never been in business before. - We gotta get back. After you, Mr. Rockefeller. - After you, Mr. Gates. (soft dramatic music) - Fender's always a good instrument to start with. You looking for something new? - No, I just need to replace a guitar string. - What kind you looking for, brass or nylon? - What's the difference? - The type of guitar you have, mostly. I got sets that run anywhere from eight to $26. - For just one string? - They only come in sets of six. - Oh, okay, I'll definitely keep that in mind. - You don't want them? - I just realized I forgot my wallet. I'll maybe come back later and get one. - Hey. What about this? Look, kid, if you got some time to spare, I got some cleanup I need done in the stockroom. Put in an hour of good solid work, I'll give you some extra strings I got in the back. - Well, that'd be great. - You know your chords? - I can do C and G. - It's a start. It won't get you far. You'll need this. It's the best chord book for beginners I've seen. - I can't afford... - Make it an hour and a half. Come back on Wednesday, and I'll toss in the book. Bring your guitar, and I'll help you restring it. But I want good hard work out of you, no messing around. - Yes, sir. I mean no, sir, I won't. - All right. Come on, I'll show you where to start. - Good morning, it's Saturday! - Morning, Belle. Ready for some toast? - No thank you. - [Man On TV] Hey, hey. Looks like things went well. - [Woman On TV] We have had a good day. - [Man On TV] Shoulda known you'd pull it off. - It's Saturday! - Great. Now move. - Get out of the way. - We can't see. - [Woman On TV] No, he went to Drake's this morning, but he should've be back by now. - Belle? Hey. Hey, what'd you guys do? - Told her to leave. - She got upset. - It's the 17th. - Jordy, go check on her, see if she's okay. - Next commercial break. - It's the 17th. - What? - It's the 17th. - Oh. Oh no, okay. Uh. Here's some money. Go get Belle a toy and hurry back. - Why? - It's her birthday, and we forgot. - $2 and 20 cents. - It's the 17th. We need a cake. - Okay, I'll work on the cake. - What am I supposed to get for $3. - Just go. - Fine. - And hurry back. We don't want her to think that we forgot. - We did forget. - Go. - Wait. - What? - I have an idea. - What are you doing? (upbeat music) - [Paul] One cup of sugar, half a cup of butter. - Two cups of flour. One teaspoon baking powder. Two eggs, one cup... - [Paul] No vanilla? How am I supposed to make a cake without vanilla? (upbeat music) - Vanilla. (upbeat music) - We don't have time to mess around. - There might be something good in here for Annabelle. - We're not giving her a banana peel for her birthday. - Look at the sign, will you? Score. - Nice. - Two cups of flour, one teaspoon baking powder. Two eggs. - Hello. Hey hey! (horn honking) Hey, watch out, watch out! (Kevin screaming) - Sorry sorry sorry. - Two cups of flour, one teaspoon, baking powder. We need vanilla. - Do you, do you live near here? - It's for the birthday cake. - Oh, is it your birthday? - No, it's, it's, it's the 17th. It's Annabelle's birthday. - Are you, you're going to get vanilla by yourself? - Two cups of flour, one teaspoon baking powder, three teaspoons of vanilla. - I, I have some vanilla in my house. Where's your house? - We need vanilla for the birthday cake. - Okay. Um, well, why don't we get you some? And then you can show me where you live. - Uh, the birthday cake is for Belle. - I bet your family is at home making a cake right now, and if we get you home... - No, no, no no no no, no. Paul doesn't make cakes. Paul makes messes. - I make cakes. - With vanilla? - If I help you make a cake, will you take it to Belle? Okay. (spoon scraping) - Hey, Paul, whatcha doing? - Nothing. I'm just cleaning the kitchen. Go to bed. - It's still morning. - I mean, go play in your room. - That's boring. - Then go play with Kevin. - Kevin's not here. - Sure he is, he's. Oh no. Kevin! - A cake. - What? Where did you get that? - I made it. - Sorry. It was the only way I could get him to show me where he lives. - I didn't know he was out here. I got busy with the... Thank you. (both chuckling) For bringing him home, and the cake, it's amazing. It's my kid sister's birthday and... - Oh, Kevin filled me in on everything. - Yeah. I'm usually pretty good about remembering this sorta stuff, but everything's been kinda crazy lately. - Oh. I brought this for Annabelle. Just some pink balloons and streamers I had in my closet. - Wow, uh, Belle would love this. Thank you. Um. - Oh, Jenny. - Paul. I don't know what to say. - I'm glad to help. - Wait, you're coming back, right? - Coming back? - To the birthday party. - Oh, no, I wouldn't wanna crash a family thing. - Crash? It wouldn't even be a party if it weren't for you. - I don't know. It might be weird for your little sister. - Tell you what. You come a little early, and you have a tea party with her and Mr. Crinkles, the bear, then you will immediately be her favorite person ever. - I do love a good tea party. - Okay then. - Okay. - Get the door here. Step down. - Kevin, Kevin. - [Brothers] Surprise! - Whoa, it's beautiful. - Come on down. - Come down, come down! (group laughing) - [Jenny] Here it comes, here it comes. (group chattering) - Wow. - Looks like a unicorn. - Almost there. - I made the cake. You're supposed to blow out the candle and make a wish. (Annabelle blowing) (group applauding and cheering) (soft upbeat music) - [Group] Oh! (soft upbeat music) (Jenny laughing) (soft upbeat music) - You can open your present now. (paper ruffling) - Whoa, a Pink Pony coloring book! - And you know what Pink Pony's favorite thing to do is, don't you? - She likes to dance under rainbows. - Don't just sit there, show us. (soft upbeat music) - Sorry your mom wasn't feeling well enough to join us. - It happens. - They really count on you for a lot, don't they? - I guess. What about you? You have any brothers or sisters? - One sister. Four years younger than me. I don't get to see her much anymore, though. - Too far away? - Uh, no, no, she lives on the other side of town, near my parents. - If your family's nearby, then why did you move in alone? - How do you know I moved in alone? - I, uh, I saw you the night you moved in. (Jenny laughing) - So you watched me carry all that stuff in and you didn't offer to help? - I, I, I didn't want to, you know. - No no no, it's okay, I see what kinda neighbor I have now. - I don't get it. How would someone like you be alone? - Actually, it's a long story. - I'd like to hear it. - Maybe some other time? - Sure. That's a pretty necklace. - Oh, thanks. It's my grandmother's. I've had it since I was a little girl, but I didn't start wearing it until last year, when I accepted Christ. Took on a special meaning for me then. - You're religious. - Yep, I'm a Christian. What about you? - Nah, religion's not really my thing. - You don't believe in God? - If there is one, our paths haven't really crossed, if you know what I mean. - Oh, I think the birthday girl's awake. - May I have some more cake? - No, but you can go to bed. It's getting late. Tell Jenny good night, and thank her for the party. - Thank you, Jenny. - You're very welcome, and happy birthday. - Can we walk you home? - I'll be fine. You guys go on. (school bell ringing) - There we go. - I look forward to seeing who signs up. - They're gonna be so good. (students chattering) (Lucas humming) ♪ And now I fear you'll never know ♪ ♪ All those times you smiled at me ♪ - Lucas is trapped in the basement. - [Jordan] No he's not. - He's screaming to get out. - [Jordan] He's singing. - No, we should let him out. - He's not locked in the base... Oh never mind. - Lucas needs our help. He's trapped in the basement. - He's all right, Kev. He's just practicing, that's all. Just nervous about that big talent show. - He should be. They'll shred him if he sings like that. He'll never be able to show his face in school again. - Hey, we can't talk like that. He's pretty good, it's just when he's nervous. That's when he's, um... - Terrible? Disturbingly weird? - Hey, come on, Jordy, your cooking's not that bad. Come on, Lucas, tell him. - His cooking stinks. - [Annabelle] Jenny has company. (water bubbling) - Hey, come away from here. Nobody likes a nosy neighbor. - Is that her boyfriend? - No, she doesn't have a boyfriend. I, I don't think. - Then who's that man she's hugging? - I don't know. - [Annabelle] Is Jenny okay? - Yeah, yeah, she's fine. I tell you what, when her guests are gone, we'll take the decorations back to her and you can see for yourself. - Okay. (footsteps fading) - Hi, Jenny. - Whoa. Hey, guys, what brings you over here? - Paul told me to ask you who your guest was. - No, that's not what I meant. - You said, ask her who her guest... - No, what I meant was, ask her how she's doing. - That's not what you said. - Paul didn't like the man giving you a hug. - Well, since you asked, that was Pastor Miller and his daughter Eliza. He's the minister at my church, and his family gave me a place to stay before I moved here. The Millers are like a second family to me. - Like us? - Yes, just like you. - Um, we actually just came over to bring back your decorations. - But you said to ask her who... - Kevin, will you take Annabelle home? It's time for her bath. - Do I have to? - Yes, you do. - Okay. - Bye, Jenny. - Bye, Sweetheart. - Jenny. - Paul, I think it's important that I be very clear about something. I think that you're a great guy. I really enjoy talking to you, but, as far as there being anything more than a friendship between us, I don't really see it happening. - Oh. - We're just in two really different places. - Look, I know I'm just a cook, but you know... - Oh no no, no no, that's not what I'm saying, no. No, what I mean is that, I'm a Christian and my faith means everything to me. And... - And I'm not. So that makes me not good enough. - No. Not at all. It just means that, there's no point in us getting involved when we're in two different places and the only way that we could bring those places together is if one of us changed, and I'm not, I'm not willing to change who I am for anyone. It's way too important to me. - I've never really thought about religion and stuff, but maybe I could change a little bit. - I mean, I wouldn't want you to. Not just for me, because then it wouldn't be real, and in the end you would just resent me for trying to be something you're not. (birds chirping) - So I guess this is it then. - Well, we can still be friends. - Whew, friend zone. Ouch. That's how you feel about it? - I really wish things were different. Goodbye then? - Goodbye. (vehicle passing) - Mr. Thompson? - Sorry. (light music) (footsteps descending) - [Lisa] Mr. Royal. - Yes, that's me. - I'm Lisa Guest, human resources. (upbeat music) - Hey. Hey, you get away from there! Hey, that's our car! Hey! Stop, come on! Get outta there! You can't. Ah! (birds chirping) (Paul sighing) - Mom, they repossessed the car. Didn't you hear them out there? Why didn't you call the police? They won't get far. The car will overheat on them in a mile or two. Have to call a tow truck. Serves them right. I'll call Ronnie's tomorrow. Maybe you can get the car back if we get a payment at the end of the month. Hope you're hungry. I brought that bacon avocado burger you like from Bo's. And Mom, there's something really important I need to talk to you about. Wake up, Mom. You need to eat something. Mom? (soft dramatic music) Mom? (phone beeping) - [Peggy] Paulie, I don't want you to worry, but I started having chest pains, and I'm at the hospital. Something's not right, sweetie. Everything's off. I just can't... It's, uh, it's the medicines. I'm taking too many of them, and if I don't get it straightened out soon, they said I could die. I spoke with some doctors, and I'll need to stay at a treatment center for about a month to get better. They say it's important to isolate, so I won't be able to leave or talk to anyone while I'm there, but it's the only way to get the help I need. - No, I, but I... - I couldn't tell them I had kids at home, Paulie. They wouldn't let me stay if they knew. - I can't. No, I can't, please. Don't... - And don't tell anybody what's going on - Don't do this. Don't do this to me! - [Peggy Voiceover] For about a month. They say it's important. I need you... - [Annabelle] Paul! Paul! - What are you doing? - What does it look like? - In the middle of the afternoon? - Where's Lucas? - He had to go get Kevin from school. You forgot to pick him up. (Paul sighing) - Look, I got an A-plus on my spelling words! I'm gonna go show Mom! - Not now, Belle. That's not a good time. - Where's Mom? - Mom had to leave to go on a trip. - A trip? - Yeah, her high school friend called her up and said she needed some help, so she had to leave in a hurry. - When will she be back? - She didn't say, but her friend's really sick. - So's Mom. - It might be a couple weeks before she comes back home. - Weeks? What about us? - I'll handle it! Everything will be fine. - No it won't. You fell asleep and forgot Kevin. - Jordan. Hey, kiddo. Can I see your spelling words. Would you look at that? You got a smiley face. That's really good. All right, everybody set? It's lights out. - Where does Mom's friend live? - We're not talking about that anymore tonight. It's lights out. - It is kind of weird, Mom taking off like that. She's hardly been out of bed for a week. - She's feeling better. And a trip like this might be just what she needs. You all set, Kev? - Night, Lucas. Night, Jordan. Night, Paul. - Night. (light clicking) (soft dramatic music) (Jenny gasping) (crickets chirping) (indistinct banging) - Hi, Jenny. (Jenny shrieking) Are you making a pie? - Oh. Annabelle. Honey, you can't be out here at night by yourself. - I had a bad dream. - Come on, let's get you home. - Okay, it's time for bed. - No, I want Jenny. - It's okay, I'll do it. Okay. You're not allowed to go outside at night by yourself. It's very dangerous. If you get scared like that again, you need to go get your brother, do you understand? - Mommy went away on a trip for a long time. I miss her already. - On a trip, huh? Well, I'm sure she wouldn't go if it wasn't very important. In the meantime, Paul's here to take care of you. - Do you miss your mommy sometimes? - Yeah, I do. A lot. I miss talking to her. - My mommy doesn't talk to me much anymore. She just sleeps a lot. - Yeah, well, she's been sick. I bet Paul talks to you, though. - Paul doesn't talk to me the way Mommy used to. - Well, Paul isn't like your mommy. He's like Paul. I bet he shows his love for you in a lotta different ways. I bet, when you need something to eat, he hurries into the kitchen and makes it for you, doesn't he? And when, you fall down, I bet he runs over and picks you up and tries to make you feel better. Okay, what you need to do is imagine that every time Paul does something like that for you, he's saying, I love you, Annabelle. Even though he's not saying it with his words, that's what he's feeling in his heart. - He is? - Mm-hm. Some people talk with their words, and other people are more comfortable talking with their actions. Okay, get some sleep. You've got school tomorrow. - Good night, Jenny. - Good night, Sweetheart. (crickets chirping) - I'm, doing everything wrong. Aren't I? - She just misses her mom. - I can't seem to do anything right. I'm a total screw-up. Kids. Job. You. - Paul. - I know. Different paths. You're a Christian, and I'm too... I don't know. Not good enough. - Okay, that's it. Come inside. (crickets chirping) - What's this? - My 18-month chip. I've been clean for 23 months. - Clean? You're an... - An addict? Yeah, I started in high school, and I was a junkie by 18. That's everyone I hurt because of my addiction. I'm trying to go back and make amends with each one of them. - I, I, I didn't know. - Those last three names, that's my dad, my mom and my sister. I've hurt them so badly I don't even know where to start. That's why they're at the bottom. - But you, you said you were a Christian now. - I am. That's what saved my life. When I heard God say my name, it changed everything. - God said your name? Nothing else? - Nothing else needed to be said. Everything was there in that one word, and I asked God forgiveness and trusted in Jesus. I never looked back. But none of that erases all the damage I did to everyone around me. And you've worked so hard to do everything you can to keep your family together. And I did everything I could to tear mine apart. And God has forgiven me. I'm just still trying to forgive myself, I guess. - Jenny, I, I didn't mean to... - I'm just, I don't think that I'm too good for you. I know that I'm not good enough. I didn't wanna tell you all of this, because usually, when I do, people just look at me differently. The way you're looking at me right now. - No, no no, I, I, I'm just surprised. That's all. Look, I, I want us to be friends. I wanna be more than friends, but... I see why that wouldn't work. So I'll settle for a friendship. If that's still on the table. - Yeah, even though I'm an addict? - That's past tense, right? - I'm not using anymore, but I will always refer to myself as an addict. - Okay. Okay then. I have an addict as a friend. (soft piano music) Might as well. I have one for a mother. - Your mom? - Yeah, umm. She didn't go on a trip. She checked into rehab. I didn't know what to tell the kids. I just, I don't want them to be disappointed if she comes home and nothing's changed. - Yeah, I get that. I didn't want my family to be disappointed in me either. That's why I haven't told them anything that's happened. I want them to see who I am now, you know, that I can be trusted. Actions speak louder than words, you know. - Yeah. Yeah, I do. (water pouring) (door opening and closing) - Jordan? You okay? - Yeah. - What are you doing up? - Drink of water. - Go back to bed. It's late. (drawer sliding) - Hurry up, Kev, we're gonna miss the bus. - I can't. I can't find my shoes. - [Lucas] They're by your bed. - No, no they're not. - You set them out there last night. - My shoes go right by my bed, next to my socks. - Did you move them somewhere and forget? - Are they in your closet? - No, I checked there. - Maybe in the bathroom? Hey, aren't you waiting for Annabelle? - No, I can't take the later bus. I have to meet with the teacher before first period. - What about your sister? - Lucas? - I'll take her. - I don't like you going by yourself. - I'll be late. - I can't go to school without my shoes. - Calm down, Kev, we'll find your shoes. - No no, somebody took my shoes! - The bus is coming. I'm gonna be late. - I can't go to class without my shoes. - Okay, go, but be careful. (birds singing) (siren blaring in distance) ♪ That's why what I dream ♪ will never be because ♪ ♪ I'll always be your somebody ♪ ♪ Else ♪ - So, that's it. What do you think? - It's good. - Really? - Yeah. You'll do great on stage tonight. Now, put these stools back in my office, will you? (Lucas sighing) I know they're old, but I just can't bring myself to take them down, too many good memories. - This, this band, you know them? - The Royal Henchmen? Yeah. We traveled the same circuit, did some shows together. What do you know about them, kid? They were before your time. - This one's my father. - Your name's Royal. - You know him? - Yeah. Yeah, kid, I knew Kenny back in the day. But, I haven't talked to him since the band broke up. - I really need to find him. Do you know where he is? - He and I were in a festival about six years ago in Florida, but, he said he loved it down there. I figured when he took off he moved there, but one of his bandmates said he'd gotten a job at a club in Chicago. - What was he like? - I'm sure you knew him better than I did, kid. - No. No, I didn't know him at all. He was always on the road. - Look, kid, I'm sorry. I wish I had better news. I knew he left a family behind. But I didn't know that... - No, it's okay. I had, I'd better go back and get ready. - Look, kid, for what it's worth, you've got his talent. Maybe even more. (bottle spraying) - Can't I just wear my hoodie? - No, you wanna look cool when you get up on stage. A tie would be better. - No ties, they feel stupid. - Okay, just... - So these are my best shirts. I only wear them when I wanna look really nice. - I am not wearing that. Ow! - Hold still, or you're gonna get a bald spot. - [Kevin] I like this one with my tie. - No. - Okay, Kevin, why don't you wear that one tonight? - With my tie? - Sure. - No, you've not seen his tie. - Maybe a tie would be a bit much for tonight. Do you have any other dress shirts? - No, I'll just have to wear my hoodie. - There's gotta be more here somewhere. Here, you keep working on this. Maybe in your parents' closet. Let me go see what I can find. (footsteps fading) (door opening) - Hey, there's the big star. How you feeling? - Like I'm gonna be sick. - Ah, so you're ready to go then? (footsteps fading) (door creaking) (soft dramatic music) Hey, Kev, you look sharp. Is Annabelle ready? - She's putting on her dress. - What about Jordy? - He's, uh, he's not here. - Not here? Lucas, where's Jordy? - [Lucas] I haven't seen him since he left for school this morning. - [Jenny] Hey, Paul? - Yeah? - [Jenny] Can you come in here? (soft dramatic music) - Hey. You okay? - Look at this. - I'm, I'm sorry. That shouldn't have been left out. I wasn't... - No, it's empty. They're all empty, even the ones in the bathroom. - No. No, that can't be right. - There isn't a single pill left in this room. - But there was. I mean, where... Jordy. - Jordy? - He's missing. - You don't think... - I don't know. Jordan! Have you seen Jordy? - No. - Lucas, check outside. We need to find Jordy now! - What's going on? - Just do it! - Um, what about the basement? - Jordy? Jordy? (soft dramatic music) (bag rattling) (soft dramatic music) - Paul Royal? - Yes, that's me. - Is this your brother? - [Paul] Yes. - We found him alone at Cedars Hospital. He was asking around, looking for his mother. He seems to think she might be a patient there. Turns out it's the third hospital he's been to today. He skipped school to take a tour. - I told him that Mom was going on a trip. I don't know he got confused. - You'll need to contact his school. We've already talked to them about the truancy. There's no further actions at this time. He's a little young, though, to be wandering around the city by himself. Don't let it happen again. - No, sir, I won't. - Good night then. Y'all have a pleasant evening. - [Jenny] Paul. - Jenny, will you take the kids up to the school? Jordan and I'll met you there. - [Jenny] Sure. Kevin, get the guitar. Let's go, Annabelle. - I don't even know what to say to you. - I just wanted to find Mom. - Mom's at a friend's. - You're lying. - Jordan. - You're lying about everything! Mom's not at her friend's. I heard her message on the answering machine. - You're right. Mom's at a treatment center. She's trying to get better so she can come home. - And you're leaving. - No I'm not. - I saw your papers. Everything you say is a lie. - Jordan, that was before... - You're just like Dad. - No, I'm not. - One day you just won't come home. - No. - You wanna leave. - And what if I do? Huh? What if I do wanna travel the world? What if I do wanna leave this house? Is that so bad? What if I'm sick and tired of going to that greasy diner every day just to come home for you to slam doors in my face and yell at me? Is it so hard to imagine that I get tired of that? So yeah. Yeah, Jordan, I've wanted to leave. But, Mom, Mom, she's gone. And I'm not going anywhere. You hear me? I'm not gonna leave you alone. You got that? - Promise? - Yeah. Yeah, I promise. - Is Mom gonna die? - No. No, Mom's just gonna be fine. She just had to, go away for a little while. So she could get better. It's you and me until that happens. But I gotta know something. Why'd you take these? - I didn't. - You went into Mom's room and you took these pills. Do you have any idea how dangerous these are? How many did you take? - None. I didn't take any. - Jordan. - I swear I didn't. I just hid them. - Why? - I didn't want her to come and get them and take off like Dad did. So I figured if I hid them, she'd have to come to me. And then I'd be able to make her stay. - Jordan. Jordan, Mom... Mom didn't leave to get away from us. - Dad did. - That's different. - How is it different? - Look, we're brothers, you and me. We're safe when we're together. No one's ever gonna change that. - Okay. - Now come on. Let's get ready. We've gotta be there for Lucas. (crowd murmuring) (crowd applauding and cheering) - Good evening, thank you all for being here tonight to support our students as they get on the stage. Our first talented young performer this evening will be playing his guitar and singing an original composition. Please welcome to the stage Lucas Royal. (crowd applauding) - That's you. You're up. (crowd applauding and cheering) - Thank you. (microphone feeding back) Sorry. Sorry. Let me try again. (soft dramatic music) I can't. (crickets chirping) - Lucas, what happened? - It's him. He's here. - Who? - Dad! He was right there in the back! - Are you sure? I didn't see him. - He came to hear me play, but I wasn't ready. I'm not good enough. - Lucas, I don't think Dad was here. - I choked. I looked like an idiot out there in front of everyone! He'll think I'm some kind of loser. He'd be right, you know. - Stop it. - Who'd wanna look up there and say "that's my kid"? Nobody, that's who, nobody! (guitar smashing) (crickets chirping) - Hey, hey hey, come on, Lucas. - It's not fair, Paul. I wasn't ready. - Hey, hey, look at me, look at me. Tell me, what did you see? - It was Dad. - What was he wearing? - Blue shirt and his hat. - Brown hair, goatee? - Yeah. - Lucas, that wasn't Dad that you saw tonight. You're describing that old picture that's in your guitar case. He doesn't even look like that anymore. - He was there! - Maybe you wanted him to be there, but he wasn't. - I saw him, Paul. I saw him. - Getting up on stage and playing his guitar won't bring him back. He's not coming back, Lucas. If you're gonna make music, do it because it's what you wanna do. - No. - Don't do it for him. It'll all be for nothing. It'll all be for nothing. (crickets chirping) (knocking on door) - Who is it? - I'm Pastor Nick Miller. I'm a friend of Jenny's. Paul? I'm Nick. I'm sorry if I caught you at a bad time. - Yeah? - Can I come in for a few minutes? I won't take much of your time. - Um. - Paul, this'll probably sound strange, but as I was driving by the other day and I saw your little sister, Hanna, is it? - It's Anna, Annabelle. - I saw Annabelle out in the yard playing, and God just spoke to me in that moment. He told me there was something I needed to do. I went back to... - So what, God, He talks to you, in your car? - Yes. So I went back to the church and told the folks there, and they put together some boxes of food and some money that they wanted to give to you. - Did Jenny tell you about... - No no, Paul, she didn't say anything. - So, God, He talks to you? - Not just to me. God talks to everybody. - He doesn't talk to me. - I wouldn't be too sure about that. When God calls out to you, it isn't loud or forceful like a TV or a person. It's often, just like a quiet whisper in the back of the minds, like, a gentle nudge urging you to listen to Him. God wants you to belong to Him so He can talk to you all the time. - What if it's not God talking to you? A small little voice, what if it's just you talking to yourself? - That's a good question. And the only answer I have is that it's different. When God speaks to me, it's bigger than me. And He often asks me to do things I wouldn't normally want to do. If it were up to me, I'd be at the coffee shop right now getting a double espresso. - Hm. - I better let you get back to what you were doing. And this is for you. I hope you can put it to good use. And I've got some boxes of food out in my car. You mind giving me a hand with those? - Um, stuff like this usually comes with strings attached. Sorry if that sounds rude. - All I can say is that God gives freely out of love. Whether or not you accept Him is entirely up to you. - Yeah. - All right then, let's get those boxes. (light music) - It needs something. - Salt? - Nope. (light music) - Basil? - Nope. - Hotdogs? - No. - No. (Jenny laughing) - Sprinkles! - Yeah, sprinkles! - We are not putting sprinkles in the spaghetti sauce. (light music) You two will not wear me down on this. (light music) (Jenny sighing) But we could make cupcakes. - Cupcakes! - Cupcakes! (phone ringing) - Hello. - Should we do chocolate cupcakes? - No, vanilla. - Hello. - Quiet down, guys. Sorry, what? - [April] Jenny, it's April. - April? - [April] Glad I found you. - How are you? It's so good to hear your voice. - [April] I'm fine. Mom's good too. But Dad's the reason I'm calling. - Dad? - [April] It's cancer. - How bad is it? - [April] He's in hospice now and keeps asking for you. Is there any way you can stay clean long enough to come see him? (Jenny crying) - Um. I'm clean now. I haven't been using for almost two years. - [April] That's great. Text me your address and I'll come pick you up in about an hour. - Yeah, or, uh, I could just meet you there. - [April] No. I need to come get you. - April, I promise you, I'm not using. - [April] I'll need to check you first. The last thing Dad needs is to see you strung out again. - Yeah. Yeah, okay. That's fair. Okay, I'll be ready. (Jenny sniffing) (soft music) - Well we need sprinkles. - Okay, change of plans, guys. (soft sad music) - Dad. (soft sad music) - [Woman On TV] Yeah, they've been at it for almost an hour now. - [Man On TV] No arguing and fighting. - Hey. What's going on? I thought we were eating at Jenny's tonight. - We were, but she had to leave. - Leave? - Her dad's sick. She went to stay with her sister for a while. - [Woman On TV] Good question. (people laughing on TV) I can't believe that really happened. - Mom's cookies. She didn't want them? - Um, I'm sorry. Kev. - I, I gave them to her. - She probably just wasn't feeling well enough to eat them. - They were right there the whole time. They might have made her feel better if she would have tried them. - Yeah. Yeah, it might have. - Jenny's gone. I miss her. - Me too. - Jenny talks to me. (crickets chirping) - I talk to you. - Jenny doesn't yell at me to wash my clothes. - We talk about other things too. - Jenny talks to me about God. (crickets chirping) - Yeah? - And how He made me this way. - What do you think about that? - It's okay. - No. It's, it's not okay. Amazing, the way you're made. Kev. You, you see things, important things. That I get busy and I forget about. You're not just okay, Kev. You're a gift. I wouldn't want you any other way. - Want a cookie? - Um. It's kind of... (crickets chirping) Oh. Mm. That's, that's really good. - That's terrible (coughs). Oh. They were better before. - Yeah. (phone beeping) - [Rita] Mr. Royal, this is Rita Sinclair with Second National Bank. Please contact us immediately. (phone beeping) - [Lisa] Mr. Royal, this is Lisa Guest with Barton Cruises. I'm calling to tell you we have an opening on a ship in our Caribbean line that we would like to offer you. We would you need you in our Miami office by the end of next week for orientation. Give me a call. I'm looking forward to speaking with you and going over your benefits package with you. (phone beeping) - [Rita] Mr. Royal, this is Rita Sinclair. We sent you an urgent letter that we have yet to receive a response to. You will need to come by our nearest branch today and make a payment to avoid foreclosure proceedings. If the funds are not received by the date on the letter, foreclosure proceedings will begin automatically. (phone ringing) - Oh, can I help you? - Yeah, my mom, she's here, she's getting treatment. I need her to sign this check so I can cash it. - I'm sorry, our inpatients are not to have visitors. - I don't need to talk to her. I just need her to sign this check. You see, it's in her name, and without it our house won't... I won't be able to pay the mortgage this month. - Patients are to avoid contact for the first three weeks... - Please! Please, please, they already, they already took the car. I really can't afford to lose the house. - I'll have to contact her doctor and clear it with her first. Why don't you leave the check here with me and let me see what I can do? - Can I wait here? I have to deposit the check before the bank closes and I have to be at work in half an hour, and if I'm late I'll lose my job. - Let me see what I can do. - Oh God. Please, please, God, please let them say yes. - Her doctor is off until tomorrow. But, I have another idea. Your mother is due in class in just a few minutes, and if I just happen to bump into her in the hallway, well. - Thank you. (soft dramatic music) - Peggy, my name's Ruth. Your son is here, and you need to sign this. Yes, so he can go to the bank so they won't foreclose the house. I got it. Oh (laughs), my. - Thank you. - Now, let's get you to the bank and to work. - What? - Well, you'll never make it on time if you have to wait for the bus. Come on. I'm on my lunch break, and my car's around back. (soft music) Come on. Chop chop! (Paul whistling) - All right, four patties, two medium well, one well done and one still mooing coming right up. - You're in a good mood today. - It must be a new girl. - It's not a crime to be happy. (phone ringing) - Hello, Randy's Diner. Paul, it's for you. - Take a message. - Can I take a message? - Table Four, food's getting cold. - I'm coming. All right, I'll let him know. Paul, that was your mom. She said to tell you that she'll be home about noon tomorrow. - Tomorrow? - Mm-hm, that's what she said. - Dude, you know what this means, don't you? You can still make it to Florida in time for orientation. - Yeah. Yeah, I can still make it. (spatulas clicking) (knocking on door) - Somebody get the door. - [Jordan] Kevin, get the door. - [Kevin] But I like this show. - Fine. - Mr. Mahoney. - [Mahoney] Hello, Lucas. - What are you doing here? - [Mahoney] Do you have a minute? - Sure. - Sorry to barge in like this, but you stopped coming to your lessons, so I was a little concerned. - Just been busy with school and stuff. - Lucas, about the talent show. - You came, didn't you? You saw what happened? - Yeah, I was there. - Then why are we even talking about this? It's a waste of time. - You had one rough go. - I blew it, in front of everyone. - Doesn't mean you have to quit. - Who's gonna take me seriously now? - I do. - I don't have it, Mr. Mahoney. I'm not my dad, and I'm not you! - Did I ever tell you why I quit music? - To start the shop? - The Melodies were offered a record deal. All I had to do was write two new songs, and we were set to go in the studio. - I didn't know you made a record. - I didn't. I couldn't write the music. I locked up. The pressure was too much. When the deal fell through, the band broke up and that was it. Don't leave it like this, Lucas. Don't let one setback shut you down. You'll spend the rest of your life wondering what coulda happened. I brought you something. - What's this? - It's yours. - It's beautiful. - But you have to promise, you'll play in front of an audience one more time. (crickets chirping) - Just one more time? - That's all I ask. (crickets chirping) - It's a deal. Thank you, Mr. Mahoney. - I'll see you in the shop Monday after school? For work? And lessons. - Yeah, sounds good. (door closing) - Paul just called. Mom's coming home tomorrow. (footsteps approaching) - Whoa, Kev. What's with the tie? - I wanna look good for Mom. - I think you missed the mark on that one, buddy. The shirt's nice, but maybe if we just lose the tie. - No no no, I look good in this tie. - What happened to you? Did you get hit by a laundry truck? - I look good in this tie. - Nothing looks good with that tie. Now go change, please. - What about these? - They're nice, Belle. Mom will love them. - Heard anything? - Not yet. - House looks good. Think we're ready. - This feels different. Will Mom be any different? - I don't know. But, I think she'll be better. (door opening) Whoa, Kevin! - Where are you clothes? - [Kevin] You said, nothing looks good with this tie. - That's not what I meant. - [Kevin] I look good in this tie. (car approaching) - There's a car. - Come on, you've gotta get changed. - [Annabelle] I forgot to put water in them. - [Paul] She's here. (knocking on door) - [Robert] Paul Royal. - Uh, yeah, that's me. - I'm Robert Style with the Spring Forest Counseling Center. May I come in? - Um, yeah, sure. - I didn't realize you had company. - We're not company. We live here. - Um, these are my brothers and my sister. - I didn't realize that Miss Royal had any other children besides you. I take it your father's not here? - Is Mom out in the car, or? - I think it's best if we speak alone. - What's going on? - Your mother never informed us that her treatment would leave four minors at home unattended. This puts me in a very difficult position, Mr. Royal. As a representative of Spring Forest, I have no choice but to report the situation to Child Protective Services. - Child Protective Services? Why? - If we don't report abandoned children as soon as we become aware of it, we risk liability. - Look, none of this, none of this matters anyway. Mom's home, the kids are fine. She's their legal guardian, so there's no point in reporting it now. - That's what I'm here to talk with you about. There's been a problem at the clinic. Your mother's been arrested. - What? - Last night, she broke into our medication storage locker. She's been charged with breaking and entering and illegal possession of stolen narcotics. - Can't you do something? Drop the charges? - It's a legal matter now. She's being charged by the state, not us. I'm sorry. I better be going. - No, no no, wait, wait. What about CPS? - I'll have to call them immediately. I have no choice. - Look, if they, if they come here, they'll take the kids, they'll split them up. - I'm really sorry. There's nothing I can do. - Let them stay here. I... I'll be their guardian. - When I make the call, the judge will move swiftly, since the children have already been alone for so long. You need to get custody of your siblings signed over to you. They'll only be able to stay with you, if you are their legal guardian. - Okay. - I'll buy you what time I can, but the police will likely be here by tonight. - Where's Mom? - I don't know. - Is she still at the hospital? - I don't know. - Is she okay? - I don't know! I don't know where she is, and I don't know when she's coming home! I'm going out. - What are you doing? - I gotta do something. - Wait. - What if he doesn't come back? - He's coming back. He just needs a little time. - What are you doing? - Paul, he keeps a bus ticket to Florida in here. - Florida? - He kept it in this bag. - Paul wouldn't just leave us like that. - We should call Jenny. - Can I help you? - Yeah, I need to get custody of my younger siblings. - Are there any biological parents who currently have legal guardianship? - Just my mom, but she's in jail. - You can file for a court hearing through family court, if she's willing to transfer custody. - I, I haven't really talked to her about it. - Have your attorney talk to her. If she's willing to sign over custody to you, then you can file for a court hearing and transfer custody. - How long will that take? - Six to eight months. - No, no no, you don't understand. I have to get this done today. - I'm sorry, sir, that's not possible. - They're coming to take my brothers and my sister tonight. - Sir, I'm gonna ask you to calm down. - No, I need you to get on that phone and and and find a judge or some paper pusher somewhere that can sign of piece of paper and tell me that I can take care of my family like I've been doing for years! - Don't make me call security. - Call them! I'm not leaving here until I get custody of my own family! - Sir, your attorney needs to cont... - I can't get an attorney! Don't you get it? I'm broke. I lost my car, I almost lost my house and now I'm about to lose my family! - Security, we have a disturbance in the lobby. - I'm good. I'm good, I'm good. Just, please, put the phone down. Put the phone down. I'm good. Look, if I can just explain everything to a judge. - It takes three to four weeks to get an appointment with a judge. - That'll be too late. I don't know where they'll be by then. What if I can't find them? What if I, what if I can't get them back? - I'm so sorry. (Paul exhaling) - Yeah. - Okay, thank you. Well, the mother is out of the picture. Peggy Royal has been arrested for some very serious charges. She won't be getting out anytime soon. - What happens now? - Without a legal guardian, CPS will have to step in. I'm sorry. - Is there any way we can stop it? - Not unless you know of some family members that can take them in. Grandparents, maybe. - They have an adult brother, but he's away right now. - If he's willing to take them, he could assume custody, but he needs to do it right away. - Right away? I thought it took months to transfer the custody. - He could get provisional custody, if his mother signed a consent form. Now, most people do not go this route, because it's only temporary, but once it's signed by both parties and notarized, it becomes effective immediately. - Does it have to be a family member? I mean, can the mother sign custody over to anyone, like a friend? - Well, it's usually a family member, but really, anyone who's willing. (keys clicking) Jenny? You're not thinking about taking... - I gotta go. - You're still recovering. Right now is... - Thank you, Aunt Judy, for everything. - Jenny. Oh. - Oh. - Paul. - You're home. - You guys made sandwiches? Guess I'm gonna have to eat this all by myself. - Pizza! - Does it have pineapples? - Of course. - Heard anything about Mom? - Uh, not yet. Say, um, before we eat this, I need you guys to go up to your rooms and pack up some clothes. - What's going on? - Just do it, okay? - Are we going on a trip? - Something like that. Now come on, before the pizza gets cold. - You dropped this. - You should be getting packed. - Not until you tell me what this means! - The CPS people will be here any minute. They're gonna take you guys and put you in separate homes. - So you're just gonna leave? - The job, in Florida, is the fastest way I can earn enough money to get custody and get you guys back. - I don't believe you! - What other choice do I have? - Jordy was right, you're just like Dad! - No, I'm not. I'm coming back to get you. I'm not gonna stop working until we're all together again. All of us. - [Kevin] You're leaving? (soft dramatic music) - Just for a little bit. We're gonna have to stay in different places until I can earn enough money to get us a home. - I don't want you to go. (soft music) - I don't, I don't want to either, Belle. But it's just for a little while. Then I'm coming back to get you. (soft piano music) - I was gonna save this for later. But I think you need it more than I do. (soft piano music) - Thanks, Kev. (soft music) Jordy, I... - It's better if I talk to him. You might miss the bus. (soft music) - Yeah. (soft music) Uh. When the folks come to take care of you, just uh, do what they say. Everything'll be all right. (Paul exhaling) (soft piano music) (door closing) - [Kevin] What do we do now? - Hey, Belle, is Lucas there? - I'm here. - Okay, I need you guys to get your stuff and go over to my house and wait there for me. Listen, I need you guys to be very quiet. I need you to turn off the lights, do not go outside, especially if anybody comes to your door. I've gotta take care of a few things, and then I'll be home, okay? - Yeah, we'll go right now. Grab your stuff. I'll get Jordan. (passengers murmuring) (soft dramatic music) - When I heard God say my name, it changed everything. - God talks to everybody. Whether or not you accept him is entirely up to you. - They were right there the whole time. (soft dramatic music) - [Jordan] Someone's there. - [Lucas] Is it the police? - No, it's a man and woman in a car. - That's them. Get away from the window. They might see you. They're coming. - Come on, we have to go. - Can I finish? - No, we don't have time. - Come on, we have to get in the back until they're gone. - I was coloring. - Come on, Kevin. - No, I was coloring! - Kevin, come on. - [Annabelle] Where's Mr. Crinkles? - I told you to pack him. - He's not here. - Annabelle. - I need him. - Keep it down. We're supposed to be hiding. - I want Mr. Crinkles? - Forget the bear, will you? - [Kevin] I need my coloring book. Where's my coloring book? - We're gonna play hide-and-seek. The people outside are it, and you and I are gonna hide. - Um. I like hide-and-seek. - Okay, come on then. We have to be very quiet, so they don't find us. - Um, I need my tie. - No, leave it. - No, no, I need my tie. I cannot go without my tie! - Kevin. (knocking on door) - [Gary] I'm Gary Shell with Child Protective Services Agency. - Kevin, come on, Kevin. Come on. - I need to speak with my mother. She's being held here. - Visiting hours are over in 30 minutes. There might not be enough time to call her up. - Please, it's really important. I need to talk to her. - I'll see what I can do, but if she's already down in the dining hall, then... - Please. It's for my family. - What's the name? - Peggy Royal. - Peggy Royal. She's already been called out by another visitor. She's in the conference room now. - Another visitor, who? - Paul? (soft piano music) - Jenny? What are you doing here? - I should ask you that. I thought you were on a bus. - I, I was, but I got off. What's that? - It's a release form for provisional custody. - Provisional custody? - Yeah, so your mom can sign it and give someone else temporary custody of the kids. - What are you doing with it? You were gonna get custody? How? You can't, it takes months to clear. - Oh no no, it's provisional, not full custody. So it's temporary, but it's effective immediately. - Today? - Yeah, as soon as your mom signs it. - I'll take it. (soft piano music) - Are you sure this is what you want? I thought you were going to Florida. - This is what God wants for me. Jenny, this is what He's always wanted for me. It was there the whole time. I just, wasn't listening. - It needs to be notarized. I'll go ask around while you talk to your mom. - Hey. You, Jenny Gardner, are too good for me. - Sorry, no contact. - [Peggy] Paulie. I'm glad you came. - Why'd you do it, Mom? - I'm so sorry. - We all thought you were coming home. - I know. I don't know what happened. I... I just... - Just what? Gave up on us? - No. No. I got scared. And I want to get better. I do. How are they? How are my babies? - [Paul] They're coming to get them, Ma. They're gonna take them and split them up. - Oh. Okay (exhales). Maybe that's for the best. - How can, how can you say that? - Look at me. I can't take care of them. - You always said that we're only safe when we're together. - Yeah. But, maybe, maybe this is good, you know. Maybe this is, this is a chance for you. Paulie, I got married, you know, so young to your dad. I was so young I didn't have a chance to, to start a life of my own. But you can. You can. - Mom, I have a life. And now I'm about to lose it. - We're so much alike. We are dreamers, you and me. We have to chase our dreams to be happy. - Don't you think I wanted to! I had a job, Mom. A really good job, traveling the world. (Peggy exhaling) I was gonna leave everything behind, the kids, you. - Why didn't you? - Mom, I know where I belong. It's home. Our home. - That's long gone, Paulie. We lost that a long time ago when your dad left. - No. No, no, we didn't. Things, things can change. There's always hope. - What? - I've seen it. Here. Sign this. It gives me temporary custody. - Custody? - Sign it, Mother. - You're, you're barely more than a boy yourself. - I stopped being a boy a long time ago. - You can't do this alone. - I was never alone, Mom. I know that now. - You're not, you're not like him. Paulie, you're not. You are so much stronger than he will ever be. - So trust what I'm telling you. Sign the paper. (soft music) (Peggy sobbing) (soft music) (Peggy breathing hard) (soft music) - How did we get here? - What are you doing with Annabelle? - My name is Lynne Womack. This is Gary Shell. We're with the Child Protection Agency. - She's our sister. - We're here to help you. - We don't need any help, thanks. - We received a report you've been living here alone without a mother or a father for some time now. - Can't we just stay here? We're not gonna bother anyone. - There is no way we can let you stay here by yourselves. - Will we be together? You promise we'll stay together? - I wish I could promise that. It's very unlikely that one family would be able to take you all in. - Stop. Let them go! Here's your paper, signed and notarized. Are we good here? - No. You may have this piece of paper granting you temporary custody, Mr. Royal, but I have a court order from a judge. And we are not leaving here until we've given you all the information about how we can help you with these kids. They seem like a real handful. - You got a deal. - Okay. Let's go inside. (soft music) (Jenny exhaling) (soft music) - Hey, if you didn't know you could get custody, why did you come see your mom at the police station? - I listened. - You listened. - Then I heard Him. - You did? We have a lot to talk about. - We sure do.
