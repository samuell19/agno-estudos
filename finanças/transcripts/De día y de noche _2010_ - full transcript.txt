The shelter of the dome continues to protect us. Perhaps in a short time there will no longer be possibility of life outside the great metropolis. I only hope that soon the balance of nature will be reestablished. The rules of the Headquarters were accepted by the citizenry. They are now carried on without discord. I dread to think of the future. Doctor Prol. 1600 days before the new order. I assure you that there is no antidote, that can counteract the enzyme. But you and your friend tried. Right? - Yes. - Was it worth it? I don't know. The important thing is to live to the fullest in our shift. Nature is... or should be... I don't know. I thought you were a sensible person. But if your answer is sincere then you ashame me. You act without even knowing your convictions. - Life... - Yours hangs in the balance. Now, how do you intend to find your colleague Dr. Prol? BY DAY AND BY NIGHT 20 seconds to enter resting state. 15 seconds to enter resting state. Record of children undergoing Headquarters training period. Citizen child Luna Pisis 432. No record. Doctor. Are you all right? I haven't heard about Luna yet. Maybe she was selected. That's what I'm afraid of. It's strange not having news from the Headquarters. You'll get them in due time. What are you afraid of? It's an honor to have our children selected. But I... I sense doubt. No. I don't know what I'm saying. It must be the loss. I still can't get used to being without her. Remember: Children have no owners, they're born free just like the rest of us. You'll soon get over it. 5 seconds to shift change. Temporary physiological check. Physical status: Optimal. Headquarters base. Shift 17,522. Biological report. Life expectancy: 145.7 years. In the outside life is extinguished quickly. Inside the great metropolis resources are increasing shift by shift. Help me turn it over. - Who is it? - We don't know. Look at his countenance. What about the death certificate? - Who received the body? - There's no record. I'll make the report. Before sending it to the Headquarters give it to me for review. As soon as I have it, I'll inform you. - Do you mind if I sit down? - No. Do you come to this park often? I used to come here regularly. Do you have a child? The parks are getting more and more deserted. They'll be gone soon. I would have liked to be a child caretaker. What about you? What's your specialty? Sorry? I apologize for my impertinence. I don't live much with citizens. I'm a forensic doctor. I work in that amphitheater. Very close. I'm used to do all my living in the same area. Like everyone else. So you're a scientist. That's right. What about you? I used to work in research laboratories. I don't work anymore. - You're also a scientist. - Yes. Why don't you work anymore? Actually, I do work. I've spent the better part of the last few years doing research, but on my own, which means that officially I'm not considered to be working. Research should not prevent you from working officially. On the contrary, you would benefit from the support of the Headquarters. Yes, I know. - Are you leaving? - I don't want to bother you any more. For the time being... Thank you. It strengthens the spirit. Overpopulation has been making productive work difficult. Today the resolution was passed to divide citizenry into day dwellers and night dwellers. I'm one of those entrusted by the new regime to develop the creation of the enzyme and to be able to subject the bodies to life shifts. Doctor Prol. 763 days before the new order. - Doctor, your presence is urgent. - What's the matter? I don't know. I've never seen anything like this before. Entering file. Urbano Libra: 113-393. Genetic evolution: Optimal. Authorization: Medical examiner. Domain: General. Unidentified bodies: 1. Doctor. - Any news about your child? - Nothing. Excuse me. I need to get some air. 5 seconds to shift change. Inhabitant: Luna, Pisis, 432. Implantation of CO2-Lucerin enzyme in system. Shift change: Done. As far as I can see the plan is still on track. I would rather not continue with this. It has gone too far. You went too far when you tried to counteract the enzyme and end the shifts. You know there was never an antidote. We only came up with a substance that changes the life shift. We need to find Prol to eliminate any vestiges of the dissenters of the past. Why jeopardize the welfare of millions? He represents the worst of human beings: Their selfishness. If I decided together with Dr. Prol to develop the antidote it was because we subjected it to ethical precepts that were considered important at the time. What were these precepts? Freedom, pleasure, pain. "Pleasure and pain." If you value your life you'd better shut up. Is your decision final? No. I wish to continue to collaborate with the Headquarters. What ethical principles you have! Any news on the whereabouts of your colleague? No, not yet, but I think I have gained the trust of the child's mother. "Mother"... Sorry, the caretaker. Just a reminder: Your time is running out. The test on the genetic experiment proved inconclusive. The enzyme reacted dangerously inside the organism. I've decided to conceal this breakthrough. I'm anxious that it may be used for other purposes. Doctor Prol. 250 days before the new order. Doctor Urbano Libra, did you return to the amphitheater yesterday? The girl's body disappeared. Because the body of the child lacks record I decided to deliver it to the Headquarters. Without prior notice? As you know, the law states that investigations that go beyond our specialty must be carried out only in the laboratories at Headquarters. Keeping her here would slow down our productivity. Would it be sacrilege to keep her here? - Did you prepare the report on the child? - It's finished. Good work. "Unidentified bodies: 1." Come with me. Have a seat. I have a game. That's the only thing I have left from my past. Watch. You try it. When the sticks move, your turn is lost. The one who collects the most wins. Try again. Is this game part of the training? The flower you gave me is still alive. In this times life, true life, manifests itself only at the instant when darkness and light meet. When the solar photons that control the enzyme disappear... What? Don't listen to me. I don't even know what I'm saying anymore. You were talking about the change of shifts? Of the eternal. But that instant doesn't last, it's barely perceptible. It doesn't matter. The important thing is consciousness. So, according to you, there is no real life? We only feel it in that instant, which, because it's so brief, becomes eternal. The extremes come together. Before, when we were not splitted into life shifts, we were complete. I don't understand your conclusion. Excuse me, it's the nostalgia of the past. Life was different. I have only lived in this one. Although I can also say that until a few days ago my life was completely different. What has changed? You can trust me. I'm running late. I imagine it must be difficult to tell your circumstances to a stranger, let alone someone like me. Not quite. In these times it is also important for me to find someone to talk to. I'm leaving. Let's hope we meet again. I promise to be more cautious next time. I'm a lucky man. My firstborn has just been born. I'll name him Urbano. He belongs to the last generation of births via natural procreation. Take care of rest time. It's the seventh day. Citizens stop working so they can go out and enjoy the metropolis. So you plan to take me out? We'll do it later, but we must walk at a distance. We can't be seen together. I don't understand. Did I do something wrong? No. You didn't. It's the situation. We're outside the rules. Do you remember what happened to you before you woke up? Some people picked me up in... Do you remember living on the day shift? Yes, I remember the sun, the things. - Now you live at night. - Yes, with you. Look. - We have the same scars. - What are they? The traces left on the body after it has undergone a life shift change. Luna, you weren't chosen to be trained. No? Then what am I doing here? When I first saw you, you were in a permanent cataleptic state. I don't understand. When we sleep we go into that state. That's why we can't wake up until shift change. You didn't wake up at shift change. Am I dead? You were injected a substance to change life shift, and it worked, just like it worked on me a long time ago. Who did it? I don't know. I was injected by my father. - I don't know about you. - Who? - My father. - Your "father"? There used to be fathers and mothers. They were the caretakers. - Do you remember your caretaker? - No, I don't remember her. It's the same for me. Do you think we will ever remember them? There's hope. Forgive my euphoria. You just trust me. You have my trust. Wait for me sitting there while I get cleaned up. Then it's your turn. What? - Then it's your turn to get cleaned up. - What? Then it's your turn... What are you laughing at? Well, you, who likes to repeat everything. As if it's the first time I've cleaned myself since being with you! - You're right. - And where do you plan to take me? - Do you like plants? - Yes. Fine. First we must agree on how we're going to move within the metropolis. I'm listening. Name: Astrophytum asteria. Family: Cactaceae. How does it occur to you to uncover your face? Look at me when I talk to you. Forgive me. An impulse. It bothered me. An impulse? Well. Try to control yourself. I assure you this situation will change. Don't worry. I know it will. We are 50 days away from the implementation of the enzyme. The propaganda of the Headquarters already convinced the whole of society that it's the only possible alternative. I have no expectations in human beings. Society was alienated, the concept of family buried in the past. The bonds of affection are about to disappear. Luna, no matter how hard you try, you won't be able to overcome me. No... No, no, no, no...! I understand your concern. The essence of the human being is found in the beings one loves. This is a mistake. Headquarters ethics bring peace of mind. Yes, but it annihilates the spirit, the capacity to be moved. And what should I do? You must find your faith. There are many other possibilities. The important thing is that when you get news about your child you do whatever it takes to bring her back to you. - What do you mean? - To be happy. And breaking the rules? Maybe I shouldn't confess this to you, but I was part of the team that developed the enzyme to enforce life shifts. And yet ever since the policy was implemented, I've had the desire to live under bodily liberty. - That's sacrilege! - No, it isn't sacrilege. What kills is what saves. If science put us in chains it can also set us free. Do you intend to alter the condition of the human being? I intend to correct a mistake. Again I'm making you uncomfortable. Yes. But at the same time I'm interested. Curiosity opens doors. I don't know. I'm Dr. Aurora Sagittarius, day shift. I'm aware that my actions have exceeded the civil codes. The reason for my behavior is I'm desperate because I know nothing about my child. I have not heard from the Headquarters. That's why I've decided to search for Luna on my own. It's of my knowledge that you, since some time ago, access my records looking for something within the files assigned to me. What relevance may have the unidentified bodies that come to the care of our shift? What is the cause that makes you trespass in such a way into my space? I'm puzzled. If I don't receive an immediate response, I'll have to do my duty and report the fact to the competent authorities of the Headquarters. Don't report me to the Headquarters authorities. My concern is personal. I know that what I'm asking you goes beyond the codes of citizenship and could compromise you, however, it's my priority to obtain from you all the information about the unidentified body I found in your registry. YOUR CHILD IS WELL Sending data on Urbano Libra, 113-393 to recipient Aurora Sagittarius, 118-432. Data transferred. Luna. How is it possible that you are in resting state? What do they want from you? Urbano, I know I have committed a grave sacrilege by entering here, but I want you to know that until I know what's going on I will not leave my child for anything in the world. Luna, try not to let misfortune invade you. I promise you that I will do everything possible for us to be together again. Urbano, I beg you to explain to me what's happening. My life is falling apart. Luna. She is your caretaker. I know she is. - Do you recognize her? - Yes. Outside. Locating coordinates. Located. I hope my mother agrees to go outside with us. - Your "mother"? - Do I have to repeat everything I say? Don't worry. I have a feeling your mother will be joining us. I have to go to work. It's important to keep up appearances until the day we leave. - Will you both be all right? - Yes. Are you sure? Don't worry. I understand that what I'm about to tell you may seem unthinkable, but events have forced us to make a decision. My father, many years ago, was forced to develop the enzyme that controls shifts. The Headquarters authorities knew that he was on the experimental stage to find an antidote. He, knowing he was being persecuted, decided to go into self-exile. But before fleeing, he injected me this unfinished substance in order to hide me, changing my life shift. I am sure that, for some unknown reason, they did the same to your child. And the only chance for you and Luna to get back together is to run away, the ultimate sacrilege. We must leave to the outside in search of my father. I'm sure he may have a solution. Departure will be first thing next shift. I hope your answer will be positive. What can you tell me about the outside? - It's been a long time since I've visited it. - I'm serious. What do you know about the outside? If I told you that life outside is vast, would you believe me? Is it? What I can tell you is that the Headquarters doesn't tell the truth about what's going on. Why is that? Because its perpetuity lies in the peacefulness, in human labor. Have you asked yourself what happened to all the resources from outside? I don't question the Headquarters. It's time to do so. I imagine that everything outside is still as beautiful. If I could... Are you being inconvenienced? We have been discovered. I must flee to the outside. I'll hide my son by changing his life shift. The risk of being outside is unknown to me and I could not expose my only loved one to such an unknown. Pain floods me with the certainty of never seeing him again. Doctor Prol. Eight years living in the new order. Apparently my child has taken a liking to you. I have to trust you. I find no other alternative. I hope you are aware that from now on you'll have to take care of both of us in the outside, as I will for you and my child... ...Luna. Look. It's really disgusting. Turn that off. I really had my doubts about your plan. I never thought it would work. You're very clever. Old feelings still linger. You just witnessed a dysfunctional episode. The disease of the mind lies in our desires. They can never be completely eradicated. Human passions were disappearing long before the enzyme was implanted. As you can see, they have not disappeared completely. Are you questioning the Headquarters scopes? Watch your words. I only ask you to grant me an answer. What will become of them? The outside will be their grave. As you know the enzyme becomes lethal when a body enters resting state twice in the same shift. Prol is no longer a problem. Nature will open its jaws. What will happen to them? You should be concerned about yourself, not about others. I did the job. Yes, you did, but you committed sacrilege. Will you break your word to let me live? We must eradicate your desire to live in both shifts. What do you mean, eradicate? We will blind you forever. From an abyss I gaze upon a world where the quest for perfection has splitted our souls, abandoning them in an emotional desert. Doctor Prol. First day of the new order. Approaching the territorial boarder. According to your will as a citizen you decide to leave the great metropolis. No return is possible. Do you like the landscape? Yes. I imagined the outside very different. So did I. Is it still a long way to go? Not far. Your mother will continue the trip. Will the three of us be able to live together? I'm confident we will.
