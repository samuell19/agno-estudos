And if my luck keeps holding true. The odds eight to five I lose. I've rolled the dice of love so many times before. And a mere broken heart ain't nothing new. I go to draw to an inside street. And it's one, two, three, four, oh you mother jazzer. Eight to five I lose, I'm bettin' eight to five I lose if I fall in love with you. And if my luck keeps holding true, then the odds are eight to five I lose. Eight to five I lose. Step right up, folks. I'm giving eight to five right over here. Stick around, everybody, we'll be right back, OK? We'll be back in a little while. ISABELLA: You were great. Oh, I've missed you. - Yeah, you do. ANGELO: You were great. So that's it. I'm not going to see you no more? Come on, now. Christmas is only three months away. Who knows, maybe we'll bring mom and dad out or something. You, take care of my sister. She's in good hands, Frank. Why Colorado? Clean air, snow, trees. No gambling. Yeah, that's right. No gambling. ISABELLA: Hey, don't you even think about it. I only see one of these on reruns of Vegas. Come on, give me a hundred. No, uh-uh. We have got to get home to Pat. Now come on. Well, we're going to make one more stop. I owe someone a grand. It's not like me to skip town without paying my debts. Who? ANGELO: Rico. [ominous music] Hey, Rico. And I thought you were leaving town with my credit. ANGELO: Not a chance. RICO: I'll tell you what. I'll give you a chance to get even. I'll give you two to one. Who do you like? Come here. What do you think? It's my last bet, come on. Huh? All right, put a grand on Al. On Al? You got to be kidding. He's no fighter. If he catches Fletch, he's going to squish in like a cockroach. You've got to be kidding. Al is no fool. Give me that four grand. No, that's all we've got. Three minutes, he'll turn it into 15, come on. In three minutes, we're going to be borrowing a quarter for a cup of coffee. The answer is no. Come on. Lover's quarrel? I've got five grand on Fletch. Let's see the money. Hey Fletch, this guy's got a class jaw. I've got a thousand bucks for every kick you land on the gorilla's chin. You set him up and you go for the jaw, you hear me? Thousand bucks. Yeah, that's it. Yeah. Get up! Get up! Yeah! Come on. Come on, come on. Come on, give me one more. One more. Take the shot. Come on, give me this one. Yeah yeah yeah! Yay! What'd I tell you, huh? What I'd tell you about [inaudible]?? You were supposed to win tonight, Al. Cheers. Now that we've got 15 grand, can we go? It's only 13, I owe Fletch two. You picking a bad time to leave town, Angelo. I got something big coming up. There's always something big coming up in Vegas. Yeah. It doesn't matter, actually. You wouldn't have a chance. Probably have to fight me. That's no problem. Right. That's why you're afraid to get in the ring with me. Hey, where's my money? I'll make you two to one dog against me. You're so full of shit. Tell you what. You don't even have to beat me. Still standing after 10 minutes, you win. How much? Angelo, no. Name it. Give me the money. Shut up. ISABELLA: Give me the money. ANGELO: Shut up! Let's do it. How much? 20 grand. You got the other five? Oh yeah, I got it. I hope so. I'll also have to take Isabella as collateral. Let's get in the ring, Rico. Because tonight's my lucky night. Why are you doing this? I'm going to win. Are you nuts? For crying out loud, you've had four drinks today. You haven't worked out in months. You want to leave this cesspool? Huh? Let's leave it in style. With 60 grand in our pockets. How do you figure 60 grand? I bet 20 at two to one. What if you lose? I ain't gonna lose. Angelo! Can't I talk you into leaving here in once piece? He's not even going to lay a hand on me. Come on, baby! You owe me $5,000. I gave you all of my money. I guess I get you too. He put you up as collateral. He bet me? Excuse me. [jazz music playing] (SINGING) I worry about you. What do you think? Let's use it, yeah? Yeah. Ang, What are you doing back here? Can I talk to you? That's it, fellas. Tomorrow. What the hell are you doing back? Jesus Christ. What happened to you? Got into a fight with Rico. Oh man. And that's not all. Isabella left me. What else is new? No, she really meant it this time. I screwed up big time. So what do you think? I don't know what to think. All I know is she didn't leave with me. So find her, that's all. And say what? Tell her the truth. Yeah, the truth is I had 15 grand and I blew it. 15 grand. Look, she's hot headed, she probably went to Doris's house, OK? Yeah. Yeah, maybe you're right. Hey, thanks, Frank. Where-- what are you doing? Where are you going? You got any money on you? What do you need? A thousand. You got it. Hey, I'll get it back to you. Don't worry about it. Crap table? Here. Sure thing. Sure thing. Dragon Room. Oh. Ang! RICO: Mind if I join you? It's your house. A gentlemen gentleman always asks. Angelo. What are you doing here? I want to talk to Isabella. She's not here. Come on, Doris I know she's in there. Please, let me speak to her. Angelo, I'm already in bed sleeping. - Where is she? - I don't know. You must know, you spend 40 hours a week talking on the phone, for Chrissakes. - All right! She's at Rico's. She went on with that asshole? - You pushed it on her. - I did, huh? Yeah, you did. Who's that? A friend. Where Bill? He went to San Francisco for a couple of days. I suppose Bill drove you into this. It's not what you think, Angelo. What is it then? Look, it just happened. Yeah, right. You're not going to tell Bill, are you? Angelo. Angelo! I really appreciate you taking me to pick up my stuff. You're welcome. You know, you should've left that degenerate years ago. I thought if I could just get him out of this town, you know? You can't change a person just by moving him to a different place. Yeah, I guess. Isabella. I've always thought you were the most beautiful woman to walk the face of the earth. You think that's funny? Well, it's quite a line. Too much? Yeah. A little. Yeah, well-- I mean it. Well, thank you. I should go now. No, stay. That's all right, I have a friend I can stay with. I have a guest room. You could stay there. Really? Sure. OK. OK. [sad music] Hey, Angelo. What happened to you? Bad day. [speaking chinese] You banking? No credit. Where did I inherit this reputation, huh? Did I say anything about credit? You have that look in your eye. I love you too, darling. So who do you like? The guy in the red. Good. I'll bet on the other one. That's it, get him. Yeah! Yeah! That's it! On the money, yeah? Was I right? Was I right or was I right? How about I fight? None of these fighters is going to beat you. I'll fight two guys. But you gotta give me three to two. If I win, I take a total of five grand home. What is it about you? You can never just take the money and leave? Come on, two against one, you'll clean up. You've got a bet. I'll go and change. Yeah! Go, go! [knocking on door] [knocking on door] Angelo, it's Charlie. Open up. [knocking on door] Who is it? Angelo, it's Charlie, open up. It's 6 o'clock. I've been trying to get in touch with you all day, but the phone's been busy. Figures. ANGELO: You got something for me? Yeah, I got something for you. ANGELO: How much you got? Five grand. Put it on the Rebels to win. Come on, you know what time it is? Yeah, I know what time it is. It's 6 o'clock. Yeah, and the game starts at 7. We only have an hour to place the bet. No shit. Listen, why don't you get the hell out of here? So I can make some calls. What happened last night? Nothing happened. Why? I heard Rico beat you out of a lot of dough and Isabella took off on you. What you talking about? It's what I heard. Yeah? Well, you heard wrong. Did I? Yeah, you did. Where is she then? We got into an argument, she spent the night with Doris. Did he beat you? Yeah, he did. Figures. What's that supposed to mean? It means he's a better fighter. He's lucky. How much he beat you for? 15 grand! Is there anything else you'd like to know, huh? Anything else? Hey, if I knew it upset you so much, I wouldn't have asked. Angelo, hurry up and make the call, would you? I'll see you tomorrow. You know what time it is? What is this, time conscious week? You want my money or I go someplace else? Hey, hey, what's with the sensitivity bit? Sit down, kid. I'm only messing with you. Count that, Johnny. Thanks. Hey. That's for you. Hey, hey, hey, excuse me. Be generous with your own money, all right? What's the big deal? It's a 10 spot. - It's a big deal. You can pop any bitch in this joint for 20. That's what I like about you. All class. He's short five grand. And you're short five grand. I'm good for it. You want 15 dimes on the rebels minus 7? That's a sick bet. Hey, they're going to win. I can feel it in my bones. I don't know, Ang. You got to do this from me, Greek. I need it real bad. You lose, you'll be here tomorrow with my money. I'm going to be here to collect. Hey, hey, what happened last night? I won. You won? Yeah. Yeah, I won. I heard you went busted. You heard wrong. [radio announcer] Everything OK? Hm? Everything OK? Yeah. [fight sounds] THUG: Hey man, you're breaking my radio. What? You know you're going to give it to us. Now you're going to have to pay us. You want money? Huh? I owe one guy $5,000. I owe my best friend $1,000. Last night, I lost $15,000 and my girlfriend. You want money? Huh? Eat this. Ha ha ha. [fight sounds] ISABELLA: Excuse me. Who the hell do you think you are? You're not going to keep me here. Excuse me. - Hey. What's going on here? You're not going to keep me here against my will. Keep you here? You're not a prisoner. You're my guest. Oh, yeah? Well, your goon here says I can't leave. It's not like that. Look. I've been here for two days. And everyone just keeps staring at me like I'm a piece of furniture or something. A fine piece of art is a more accurate description. Where are you going? To get my hair done. What the hell are you staring at? Here. What's that? A little shopping money. Enjoy yourself. No, thanks. Go ahead. No. Really. Thank you. - OK. Be back for dinner? Take her wherever she wants to go, Nick. [phone rings] Hello? CARLOS (ON PHONE): Isabella, please. She's not here. CARLOS (ON PHONE): This is Carlos. She has an appointment today at 11:30. I'm running a little behind. Ask her if she can make it at 12:00. Yeah. I'll tell her. [knocking on door] Who is it? Where's my money, kid? Something came up. Need a couple days. Oh, you need a couple of days. How come you didn't ask me? Or do you only come around when it's time to collect? I'm asking now. You pay the juice. I told you, I don't have it. I need a couple days. That's all. You know, anybody else and I have him put a bullet in their back. But you, you I like. I'm going to give you a chance to work it off, kid. Johnny here is a little short of help. His assistant called in sick. So you're going to help him out. Come on, Greek. I thought we were friends. We are. We are. This is strictly business. Don't make me change my mind, kid. OK. I'll give him a hand. Good. Lovely watch. Nice gift from you to me. Right? Come on. Let's go to work. I need to make a stop. Fine. I'll go with you. I need to talk to you. Give us a minute? Fine. Call me when you're ready. Listen. Oh, save it, Angelo. If I had a nickel for every time we made up, I'd be a rich woman by now. You know what's wrong with you? No. But I'm sure you're going to tell me, aren't you? I didn't come here to talk you into coming back with me. Good. Because you know what, Angelo? I'm not going back with you. What's with the smart answers. I'm not some asshole that's trying to pick you up. What are you here for, to see Carlos? Are you two dating behind my back? Can you just listen while I speak here? No. I'm not going to-- Can you just close that little yap of yours for a minute? I'm not going to close my little yap. - Can you shut up? - No, I'm not going to shut up. Shut up! Come here. Come here. Come here. I don't care if you stay with Rico. No. I do care. Get away from him. That's all I can tell you. He's bad news. Oh, really? Look. I've known you for three years. And yeah, I broke promises. And I lied to you. But I'm telling you this time, you stay with this guy and you're going to get hurt. That's not what I want to hear. What are you talking about? You know exactly what I'm talking about. One week. One week and I am leaving this stinking town forever. If I had a nickel for-- For every time I said I was leaving this town, you'd be a rich woman? I know. I'm saying it now. We'll get in a car and we'll drive any place you like, Seattle, Frisco, Colorado. You name it, we'll go there. Wish I could believe you. This time it's for real. Forget it. Won't be long before [inaudible] finds you. I like Rico. He's good to me. So why don't you just leave me alone? Have a good life. So, we got a problem with the broad? Nah, it's OK. So, where we going? - North. North. Can you be a little more specific? So, you're a big time gambler. Yeah, I do OK. What about you? You gamble? Nah. You don't gamble? No. What do you do for kicks? What are you, writing a book? Get in the car. I'll show you what I do for kicks. [doorbell] Wow. You look great. Well, thanks. I have a surprise for you. What is it? Well, if I told you what it was, it wouldn't be a surprise, would it? What is it? Open it. Oh, my god. It's beautiful. Let me put it on you. You go around the back. Give me about 30 seconds and then I'll flush him out. Thanks for the help. Well, what the hell took you so long? Come on. Let's get the car and get out of here. Thing's still alive. Can I ask you something? Hm. Do you have a wife or kids? You don't seem like the type to go to church on Sundays. I mean, what do you do for fun? I like to hurt people. I like to make them suffer. I dedicate this fight to you. [crowd noise] PATRON: Hey Johnny, how about another beer? You got my money, asshole? Here's a chance to earn your money now. Let's see what you can do. Here's your fucking money. Thanks for the help. Jesus Christ. Clean yourself up before you embarrass me. I know you don't love me now. But in time, you will. I need to go and pick up some more of my things. Give Nick a list. He'll pick up anything you need. I would like to go out and pick up my own stuff, drive a car, go shopping, go out to a restaurant by myself, thank you. All right. Go. You're letting me go? Here. Take my car. Alone. No goons or anything? Alone. Bye. Where you going? To take a bath. You're not going out? Not right now. I just wanted to know that I could. That's all. Hey. You heard from her? No. Don't worry about her. She's just trying to make you jealous. She's going to call soon. You know, she's doing a damn good job. Hey, are you OK? No. I'm not OK. I owe you. I owe the Greek. I owe the landlady. I owe everybody. Don't worry about me. I told you, forget about it. As far as I'm concerned, it's a dead issue. You always come through for me, Frank. It's an investment. An investment? One of these days, you're going to hit it big. You know why? Because you think big. Like when we first come to town, right? We walked into that hot crap game. You had $100. I had $100. At the end of the night, you had $30,000 and I had $120. Yeah. Three years later, I'm busted. What does that tell you? That 15 years later, I'm still singing in the lounge. Look. I saw you win $130,000 in one night. That's more money than any one of these working stiffs are going to make in a lifetime. What's it going to take, Ange? A million dollars. Million dollars. Yeah. When I drove into this town with Isabella, I swore I wouldn't leave unless I was a millionaire. You know what? You're not going to leave this town. You're not going to leave with $1 million, $2 million, or $10 million. You know why? Because you love the action. I'm leaving. I'm leaving as soon as-- As soon as what? Let me tell you something. You don't wise up, you're going to lose Isabella, too. Hey. A minute ago, you were on my side. I'm on your side. But she loves you. Don't ruin that. What are you talking about? She left me. So, go after her. Get her the hell out of this town. Build her dream house. Get her a couple of kids. Do something. She thinks I'm a degenerate. Maybe you are. [knocking on door] What do you want, Angelo? I'm sorry. I want to talk to Isabella. - She's not here. Come in. Want some coffee? Have you heard from her? Yeah. She still with Rico? Yeah. If she calls, will you tell her I need to talk to her? Sure. Hey. Thanks for everything. You're a good friend. I'm, I'm sorry. You know I, I like her. You like her? I love her. It's not enough. I didn't mean to hurt her. I just want her back. Angelo, why would she come back to you? Look at you. You're worse than you've ever been. You're a drunk and a degenerate. [music playing] Spring time, sunrise in a warm desert morning. I'll be your honey. You can be my hero. It's a been a while since the cards smiled. Now one fine day, I'll be heading down the road on the right side of zero. Well, there's a break even point, I know. And I will find it before I get old. But if you don't know where halfway is, well, how can you know if you're getting old? Spring time, sunrise in a warm desert morning. I'll be your honey. You can be my hero. It's been a while since the cards smiled. Now, one fine day, I'll be heading down the road on the right side of zero. Well, there's a break even point, I know. Just where it is, it's so hard to tell. But if you don't know where even is, how can you know if you're doing well? Before you disappear when I count to 10, I'll be your honey, you can be my hero. Til then, I'll be counting on you to tell me when. I'm heading down the road on the right side of zero. Well, there's a break even point, I know. Just where it is, so hard to tell. But if you don't know where even is, well, how can you know if you're doing well? Where's the ketchup at? How'd you get in here? I knocked on the door. Nobody answered, so he jimmied it. You do that again and I'll kill you. Look, you put yourself on the spot here, kid. And until you pay me the money you owe me, I own you. I own your freedom, your privacy, I even own your old lady if Rico hasn't already taken care of that. You son of a-- [gun cocks] Come on. Let me see how brave you are. One step, kid. You can do it. Yeah, I thought so. You're all a bunch of muscle-building fags. You like to get in a ring and play with each other, thinking you're tough. Well, you ain't nothing to me, kid. Yo, Lefty. Go get him. I got your money, Johnny. I just wanted to see you run. Funny, huh? [groans] Go ahead and shoot. Hey, Frank. How's it going? Hey, Ange. Good. Good. How you doing? All right. give this envelope to Isabella for me? What, are you leavin'? Yeah. Where you going? Atlantic City. Ha ha ha. Come on. Let's have a drink. - No. No. I gotta get going. Seriously. Where are you going? I got that cabin up in Colorado. You tell her I'll be waiting? All right, Ange. That's good. Take care of yourself. OK. I'll see you, Ange. Ange. Saved me a trip. I was just about to pay you a visit. You don't have to come looking for me. I'm right here. I owe you $5,000. You get it when I get it. I like you, Angie. You got a lot of balls, kid. I admire that. Sit down. - Can't. - What's your hurry? Where you going? I'm out of here for good. Not until you pay me my money. I told you, you'll get it when I get it. Hey. Suppose I found a way for you to pay off what you owe and make $100,000 on top of it? Keep talking. Rico's having a tournament at his place. Yeah? I'm listening. 50 fighters. $10,000 apiece entry money. The winner walks with half a million. Now, I'd put up your entry money for you. If you win, you get $100,000. Simple as that. What's the catch? The catch is that you have to win. Christine, coffee, black. Rico thinks he can't lose. If he wins, he gets the money. If he loses, he plans to send in three of his goons with shotguns and rob the joint. Now, if you can take care of Rico, I think I can take care of his three goons. Sounds good. Can you beat him? Think so. Oh, kid. You're going to have to do better than that. Let me ask you something. If I were you, and some guy was popping my girl, I'd tear his heart out. 50-50. 50-50? I beat Rico, I get $250,000. Absolutely not. Ciao. Angelo? What about Isabella? I get $250,000 and I tear his goddamn heart out. Now you're talking, kid. See ya. MICHAEL HORN: Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to the arena. I'm Michael Horn here live from KWAB Sports Radio, about to present to you a very special event. Now, tonight's total cash prize is half a million dollars. Strength, stamina, speed, and skill will decide tonight's victor in a kickboxing extravaganza of one-on-one direct elimination bouts. 50 hopefuls are out for blood tonight in a winner takes all competition. And make no mistake, all these fighters want to win badly, seeing as each of them had to put up $10,000 apiece to enter. Whoa. What a surprise this is. Angelo de Grassi blasts his way through big Hank Louis like he wasn't there. Absolutely astounding. Ladies and gentlemen, Killer Conroy stepping into the ring now, a fitting name for this particular fighter since he usually ends up mauling his opponents rather than simply beating them. During this competition last year, I believe Conroy actually shattered one opponent's knee. Needless to say, that guy no longer fights. And of course, Rico, our host. Here's a fighter who truly enjoys the combat. Angelo versus Hayes, now. Angelo steadily cutting his way through the competition. We'll see if he can sustain this remarkable performance. How we doing, Ange? If I win my next fight, I gotta fight this guy. Good luck. MICHAEL HORN: That's another one for Conroy. This native of Hell's Kitchen is truly a force to be reckoned with. MICHAEL HORN: Angelo de Grassi is fighting like a man with a mission tonight. And Conroy moves into the semifinals. Rack up another one for Rico. And he moves into the final round. Better place your bets now, ladies and gentlemen. The action's going to get hotter. Because it's Angelo and Conroy in the semifinal. The winner of this match goes on the fight Rico. And the winner of that fight gets-- yup, you guessed it-- half a million dollars. Your worries are over. I'll take care of Rico's men. You take care of Rico. What? You want some more of this, huh? Come on. [gunshot] Shut up. OK, boys and girls. It's time to pass the hat. All your money and your jewelry. Move, move. Pick it up, now. Don't even think about it. What? Out. Get out. - It was just a friendly game. - Yeah? Yeah. Matchsticks. We were just playing for matchsticks. Sure. Could have waited one more hand.
