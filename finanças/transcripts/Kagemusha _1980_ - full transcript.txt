I have impersonated you for a long time... but he is a miracle. Where did you find him? At the execution grounds. He was going to be crucified. I thought he would be useful as a double for you. What did he do? They found him sneaking around the grounds. He's a thief. A thief? And a tough one. Torture failed to make him talk. Possibly, aside from stealing, he's also killed. What did the prosecutors say... about his resemblance to me? Nothing. Only I, your brother, could see it from the first. His hair, Clothes, the way he talks, all so different. No one has the least idea of his resemblance to our lord. But I was surprised at the remarkable resemblance. Then we dressed him like you. It was amazing. Where is he from? As you see... he is very much like you. Our father might have had a son somewhere else. But do not fear. He is from northern Japan. He's not our half-brother. Even with this resemblance, Nobukado... he is so wicked as to be sentenced to crucifixion. How could this scoundrel be my double? I only stole a few coins. A petty thief. But you've killed hundreds... and robbed whole domains. Who is wicked? You or I? I was going to be crucified. My life could have ended this day. I am immune to threats. Boil me! Broil me! Very well. Say whatever you want. If you will not say it, I will. I am wicked, as you believe. I am a scoundrel. I banished my father and I killed my own son. I will do anything to rule this country. War is everywhere. Unless somebody unifies the nation and reigns over us... we will see more rivers of blood... and more mountains of the dead. It is cold. My old wound hurts when the air is cold. Nobukado, he has Spoken hastily. He might be of some use. Train him. KAGEMUSHA: THE SHADOW WARRIOR In the 16th century, Japan is torn by war. Warriors vie for the capital Kyoto, for the Conqueror will rule Japan. There are three rivals. Shingen, Nobunaga and leyasu. In 1572, Shingen marches toward Kyoto. 1573 We've cut the water\Nay into the Castle. The castle will soon fall. I hope so. We have had it surrounded for 20 days. I don't think the enemy leader will surrender soon. Someone plays the flute every night. And he plays well. Our men are impressed. They like to hear it at night. Listen! We must let my father know we've cut the aqueduct. Lord Shingen, your father, is here. Except for us chief vassals... not only the enemy, but our own men believe the lord is here. It is needless to send messengers to him. Sire, Masakage Yamagata is here. Send him in. Leave us alone. - My lord. - I'm angry. Asakura sent me a message. He is returning to his fief. His men are weary and it is midwinter. The enemy is also tired. If Asakura retreats... Nobunaga will reinforce leyasu and block my way. Asakura's retreat is treason against me. How old are you, sire? - Fifty-three, as I remember. - Why? And you still behave like a 5-year-old child. People gather, scatter. They go left and right following their interests. That is not surprising. But then I find you like this. With such a narrow mind, you must not dream of rulership. Go back to your own domain. You are a mountain monkey. You should be gathering nuts in the mountains of Kai! That's enough. What brought you here? We've cut the aqueduct. Will the castle fall soon? I wonder. There will be rain and snow. The Castle can stand longer. The garrison leader is a fine warrior. He lets us hear the flute at night. I heard about that flute. Will he play again tonight... without water? If we hear him tonight the garrison will hold. The Castle will not fall. But if we do not hear the flute, the Castle is doomed. Its fall is near. I want to hear if the flute is played tonight. Prepare my seat in the Castle. What? Shingen is dead? According to our spy, there is a rumor that he was shot. Stupid! It's just talk. Is he alive? Is he dead? That is the point. Bring a stool. There is only one thing in the world that can frighten me. That mountain monkey. He has bothered me. His death helps. I would go to Kyoto and take a nap. Discover the truth of his death. Understand? My horse! What? Lord Shingen is dead? A sniper shot him. He was badly wounded. Is he dead or alive? Either way it is a chance for our Tokugawa Clan. Be quiet. Even if he did beat me at the battle of Mikata... lam no coward. His death does not please me. As a warlord, he has been unrivaled. He is just over 50. If he really dies, it is a great loss. We have won many battles. Why retreat now? Strange. I heard this rumor. Our Lord's been shot. Open your eyes and look for yourself. Lord Shingen is over there. To occupy Kyoto... to put my flags in the capital... has been my long-cherished dream. But... if I die, we must forget it. Let it be a dream. Remember. My death must not be known. Keep it a secret for at least three years. Guard our domain. Never move from it. Do not move. If you ignore my order and leave to attack... our Takeda Clan will be no more. Note that, men. Consider it my will. Father. But I am not going to die. I said "if." I must prepare for the worst. But, no. I will not die. The lancet holes of the Castle were like this. And the target? Under the stone wall of the second tower. If I am similarly here... that pine tree is the same distance and direction. You saw Takeda's men make a seat there during the day? They put up three bamboo poles with white paper. I thought an enemy lord might go there to listen to the flute. Iset up my gun during the day. Do as you did then. I put the gun through the lancet hole like this. I steadied my aim and waited for the night. Shoot. Go ahead. Shoot. It was dark, at night, no bonfire. I could not see. Some time after the flute began... I pulled the trigger like this. Then what? As soon as I shot... noises came from the spot I aimed at, like now. Calm them. Now we can believe that Shingen was wounded. Not yet. If he was... the Takeda army would have annihilated the enemy. They would have tried to kill this sniper at least. No. They want to keep it a secret. They would not. They made peace when they had almost won. And they returned home. It is strange. A ruse, perhaps. Have we crossed the Seta Bridge? I can see Kyoto. Occupy it! Put my flags in the capital! Our lord? I cannot see him yet. What a sight. Beautiful. The invincible Takeda army. Keep your line! I don't think we can keep my father's death a secret. Some saw his body in the palanquin. I took care of them. They died. But there are spies from Nobunaga and leyasu. You must observe your father's will. We must try our best. Nobukado impersonated the late lord in battle. The enemy has never known. We must deceive our own men too. But Nobukado cannot do that. And the secret will be out. Exactly. I cannot myself deceive our men. But if there were another double of the lord... Another double? I have prepared for such an occasion. Take a look at him. Come in. Remove your mask. Where is the lord? You were born base! You cannot see a lord so easily. Make way for the lord! - You saw him? - Yes. I think it is Shingen. Let's have a closer look. It might be a double. - I'm sure it is... - Shingen. Ieyasu sent you? Nobunaga sent me. I don't understand. I found a guarded palanquin hurrying north. I thought Shingen was in it. A doctor was beside it. I thought Shingen was wounded. But look at that. Shingen was not in the palanquin. Listen. The party rested, then returned to the main force. And the doctor's servant was killed on the pass. It doesn't make sense. Why did they turn back? Why did the servant have to be killed? But it is Shingen. No doubt about it. That is right. It is Shingen himself. Do not push your luck! What if someone saw you just now? Impossible. He was dying before. Now he's healthy. You do not know the truth. Are your spies blind? Old? Deaf? Shingen had some reason to return home so abruptly. He must be wounded, or dead. If he were healthy, he would have surrounded us by now. Do not move! You've disappointed me. Of all things, you tried to steal and escape. I can play the role of his double from time to time. But not from morning till night. It is too much. Besides... the lord is already dead. You lied to me. You tricked me. Shut up. Do as you are told. You cannot treat me like this. Come, come. There is a good reason. We must keep the lord's death a secret, as he wished. What do you mean? We must pretend he is alive. But these three know. Those who were close to him should know. I was intending to tell you too. I want you to keep this role. Not anymore. I cannot. - Do not be obstinate. - It is not that. The lord is dead. I have no duty to anyone else. Listen. He wanted to hide his death. Because he wanted to live with us for three more years. If you have any duty toward him it is now. Perhaps you are right, but I had been thinking he was alive. Then I found him dead. Suddenly, it all seemed stupid! Hopeless. We cannot use him. There is no other way. Only he can deceive everyone. Listen. If you refuse to act as the lord, you will die. You saw the lord's corpse. But if you help us... you will be rewarded and released in three years. You owe your own life to Nobukado. He is asking you now. Enough! No matter what you say, he will never understand us. Mind you... he has nothing to do with the Takeda Clan. It is selfish of us to make him solve our problems. This role is for someone who can die for the Takeda Clan. Release him. But if he goes free, then everyone will know. There is no way not to. Tomorrow... we will bury the lord's body in Lake Suwa as he wished. This is no time for killing. Day after tomorrow... it will be a sad march home. Let us discuss it. What are they doing? What is in that jar? Strange. The jar is gone. What happened? I have it. I thought the jar contained a treasure, but I was wrong. They would not abandon that. And the Takeda warriors behaved unusually. I am sure the jar contained Shingen's body. The man we saw from the mountain was his double? Definitely. Three spies were in that hut. They saw everything. Send your men to kill them! We are going to tell our soldiers of his death today. Naturally, the enemy will know at once. Leave. What do you want? Payment for the information? No. Let me help you. I do not want any reward. Make use of me. I want to be of some use to him. Use me. I beg you. A jar of sake dedicated to the god of the lake this morning. What did it say? Now I'm disappointed. The jar contained sake. Sake? It was dedicated to the god of the lake. Is that all? Then is Shingen alive? Wait. There will be a Noh performance tonight. We will see if the lord is real. It is a lucky day. Boys' Festival and now the return of your grandfather. Will my father come home? But you are the heir. You will be the first to greet the lord. I know. He is the master here. And next to him, you. Why do I come before my father? I do not know. Lord Katsuyori, your father, is your guardian. You are his charge until you grow up. Hurry. The heralds are at the gate. Now go and greet them. The East Gate? No. You will see him in the Main Hall. The lord is back! First, enter the Bishamon Hall. Next, the Fodo Hall, then the Izuna Hall. And then the Main Hall. Understand? I have already taught you how to behave. Congratulations, my lord. No! He is not my grandfather. What are you saying? He's fought many months. His countenance may have changed. Besides, he suffered an illness during the battle. A serious illness can change us. Go closer to him. Have a good look at him. It's true. He has changed. I'm not afraid of him anymore. That's good! That was close. I should have thought of it. Children understand. But you treated him properly. Well done. I did not know what else to do. That is all right. The late lord was straightfonNard. He stepped straight into the hearts of the others. Remember that. Behave as your heart wishes. That is best. The hidden guard room. When the lord gives audience, guards are waiting here. Also, guards are here all night. The sutra room. The lord reads the sutras here. And this is the living room. The lord relaxes here. Beyond is his bedroom. These three attendants and two pages know everything. They will take care of you. One of them will always be at your side. Behave as they bid. You will not be suspected. These people know who you truly are. They are like your family. Be frank with them. I have chosen clever boys for you. I know it is difficult. I was for a long time the lord's double. It was torture. It is not easy to suppress yourself to become another. Often I wanted to be myself and free. But now I think this was selfish of me. The shadow of a man can never desert that man. I was my brother's shadow. Now that I have lost him... it is as though I am nothing. Well, you are going to meet the lord's mistresses. These men will teach you manners. Study the structure of this mansion. Don't get lost in your own house. My name is Tsuchiya, chief attendant. Amemiya is mine. Hara is mine. Amari is mine. Tomono is mine. Do not be too proud. What are you doing? The late lord never did that. How is this? Little Takemaru was a problem, but the horse is worse. It can tell. Only the late lord could ride it. If the double falls off, everyone will suspect. Lord Shingen has been ill. He must refrain from riding. Good idea. There are many other problems. We must be careful to keep the late lord's intentions. Tonight he will have to meet the late lord's mistresses. How will he be with them? Our master has been ill. He must refrain from riding. Where is Lord Katsuyori? With Takemaru. He is another problem. Maybe the biggest. He has never once smiled since his son Takemaru was chosen as heir. No wonder. He has won many battles. Now he is a mere guardian. He cannot be happy. And above that, he has to call a thief "father." As do we. Forget such personal feelings. We must be united. That is all. I will return to Suwa Castle. He is late. But we cannot go any further. I am worried. Nobukado is with him. Besides, even I cannot tell which is which. He will be safe. Will he? In bed? Do I look like a different man? You have not changed in appearance... but your voice has changed because of the illness. The way you talk too. A serious illness can change even a man's heart. On second thought, you do look like a different man. Very well. The game is over. Actually... I am not Lord Shingen. I impersonate the lord. You are joking. It is true. Nobukado became tired of the work and hired me. Ask him. Isn't that true, Nobukado? Look at me carefully. I am not your master. You are drunk, sire. It is late. Good night. The master will not stay with either of you. The doctor said he must not exert himself. You are the leader of the Takeda Clan. No one may deny this. You. The late lord destroyed Lord Suwa who owned this Castle. He loved Suwa's daughter and you are the result. You are Suwa's grandson. He could not appoint you heir. So he compromised and made your son Takemaru his heir. In his heart, he always thought the position yours. No. I was not a son to him. He always treated me as one of his retainers. No. He wished to be buried in Lake Suwa, in his armor. Do you know why? Because he wanted to be near you, to aid you. Since you live here in Suwa Castle... I believe this shows his feelings. He forbade me to use his banner... with the four letters for Wind, Forest, Fire, Mountain. It represents the head of the Takeda Clan. That banner represents your late father. He forbade you to use it because he wanted you to surpass him... to fly your own banner. My father's intention was to ignore me. His own chief retainers treat me with disrespect. Consider this, even if this was his plan... how could I call a thief my father, bow down to him? But now your name as a brave warrior is well known. The day will come when the retainers will kneel to you. Why are you called a mountain, Grandfather? Mountain? Everybody calls you that. "Where is the mountain?" Is it because we have that mountain in our garden? You know the master's banner. What do the letters mean? Swift as the wind. Quiet as a forest. Fierce as fire. Immovable as a mountain. The lord is that mountain. Both in battle and at home... he is steadfast, like a mountain. When his army moves... first, the horsemen attack as fast as the wind. Second, the lancers advance quiet as a forest. Third, the cavalry raids mercilessly as fire. And the lord is behind them, always watching over them... immovable as a mountain. That is why our soldiers... can fight so strongly. Immovable as a mountain. The lord is that mountain. So we call him the mountain. I see. Understand, Takemaru? The spies agree Shingen has returned home. There were no other reports. I don't understand. It was his Chance to take Kyoto. Nobunaga, his rival, is busy fighting other warlords. Shingen would not miss such an opportunity. Very well. Let's attack. Attack whom? Takeda's outlying Castles. Attack them and watch Takeda's reaction. Their reaction will tell us if Shingen is behind them. Messenger from Lord Katsuyori! What are you doing? Nobukado is coming. Be careful. They'll see you. Tonight, as soon as Lord Katsuyori arrives... we will have a conference of the entire clan. You will have only to sit with dignity and listen. The decisions will be made by the generals. Then I will say: "The discussion is over. Let us have your instructions." Then you will nod in satisfaction and say: "Well done. Thanks to you all." And then stand up and leave. Understand? Well done. Thanks to you all. And then stand up and leave. Do not try to put on airs. The late lord was like a mountain. Act naturally. Like him. The discussions are concluded. Let us make our decision. Ieyasu is unforgivable. We beat him once at Mikata. He did not learn and now he is attacking us. I will drive them all from our domain. Only one Castle has fallen. You need not go yourself. He must study leyasu's moves to understand his purposes. The Tokugawa army has burned Okabe Castle. Now they are surrounding Futamata Castle. We must counterattack now to save Futamata. The castle is protected by Anayama. It is impregnable. If it is in danger, he will ask the lord for help. Ieyasu does not move capriciously. He studies our reactions to his initial attack. He is young but very thoughtful, cunning. That's why Nobunaga trusts him. He frightens me. We must discover... what he meant by this attack. That is first. But it will be too late when we find out what he meant. Attack now... or wait and see. What does our lord think? Father, what are your instructions? Do not move. A mountain does not move. Well done. Thanks to you all. Lord Katsuyori behaved badly. He knew it was the late lord's double. But that man countered beautifully. We cannot approve. He shamed Katsuyori publicly. He went too far. I admire his wit, standing up like that. But sometimes a witty man depends too much on his wits. He must stay within the limits of his role. I know. Still, he impressed me. Even though he's tough... it must be torture. He must feel as if he were truly on the cross. What is it? A dream. A million enemies surrounded me. Tell leyasu this. While I fight Lord Asai... ride out and see if Shingen is really dead. Just asking will not help discover the truth. Amen. Noda Castle and Nagashino Castle have fallen. You're good, Grandfather. Another war? Are you scared? No. But you'll be gone. I'll miss you. Noda and Nagashino have fallen. Where is leyasu? He and his men have surrounded Futamata Castle. Katsuyori's gone to battle. What? Without a conference? On his own? Where did he go? Takatenjin. Takatenjin Castle? Not a bad strategy. If he takes the Castle, leyasu will be threatened. Only if he takes it. Even his father failed to take it. I do not think he can. Ieyasu has a Chance to attack him from the rear. You may go. We must send our troops to protect him. Shingen's banners will make leyasu believe he is there. That is right. The banners will frighten him away. May, 1574. The lord's banners in the rear. Do not move. No matter what. Understand? Not again. He stands behind me at every battle. He treats me like a child. Let him. We will take over this Castle with our own hands. Tell the men to break into the Castle. No, burn it. What is this? A group of horsemen are coming this way. Our side support? What flags? No flags. Ours or theirs? I cannot tell. Now I see! The enemy! Make walls of those lances. Battle formation. The enemy! A raid! Keep calm. Let them go! Come back! Enemy on the left hillside! Enemy on the left. Attack! Enemy's retreated! Back to first battle form! Look. They died protecting you. Imagine you are already crucified. Do not move. What is that? Enemy on the right. The banner is marked "Hon." it is Heihachi Honda, one of Tokugawa's bravest generals. Enough. Pull back. Do not move! But I still feel Shingen is dead. I do not know why. That is what I feel. Why? I do not know. I just feel so. We both hope Shingen will die. It would help us greatly. So we anticipate his death. We long for it. Maybe that is all. The color is like blood, but it is European wine. What is the matter? Do you not like it? Well... I'll stop those religious rioters in Ise. I'm quite busy. I've been too late to help you. This gold expresses my regrets. I will leave Takeda to you. Farewell. Nobody can deny that you took Takatenjin Castle. Even your father failed to take it. No! It is true I took the Castle. But the credit does not go to me. It goes to my late father who frightened the enemy away. I cannot escape from him after all. The chief retainers are to blame. They use the lord's double to make you seem small. The mountain? In the garden, with Takemaru. This will not do. I told you, one of you must be with him. I am sorry. He is now well used to living in this house. He has become sure of himself since Takatenjin. He is doing well. As if the late lord were inside him. And he's charmed Takemaru too. The child loves him. It makes me sad to see it. That is so. It is a cruel thing to do. Someday he will know. It will not be long. The third year is almost over, keeping this secret. When the day comes... it is not only Takemaru who is to be pitied. What will happen to the double? A double means something only when there is an original. When the original is gone... what will happen to the double? Where is the lord? He's great. Only he can ride that horse. Nobukado, he doesn't have the scar. The wound he got at Kawanakajima. So he is an impersonator after all. Grandfather! This man is not your grandfather. He's an impersonator. Grandfather! Grandfather! How stupid. He could deceive men, but not the horse! I was to blame. You have taken care so that we have done properly. We thank you for that. Lord Katsuyori has arrived. The play is over. Lord Katsuyori is our master now. From Nobukado. He appreciates all you've done. This is with the compliments of the other generals. Take it. Keep well. Go away. Get out of here. I want to see Takemaru and say goodbye. Takemaru? What impudence! How dare you? Go! April, 1575. What? They conducted Shingen's funeral? That is like Shingen. For three years after his death... he successfully deceived me. Even the 50 years of a man's life. Is shon* compared to that of this world. Life is but a dream. A vision, an illusion. Life, once given. Cannot last forever. Katsuyori has left his domain, with 25,000 soldiers... heading for Nagashino. The mountain has moved! My lord, what do you think that bar of light is? - A rainbow. - No. It is your late father's instructions not to proceed. He is telling you to stay in your domain, to guard it. Those were your father's last words. Do so. Then nothing can harm us. Harm us? Nothing could. Our ancestors never lost a single battle. We never retreat. Forward! May 21, 1575. Wind. Fire. This will be the end of our clan. Goodbye. I will go first. Wind. Forest. We will meet again where Lord Shingen is. Attention! Takeda will be no more. The mountain has moved. Messenger. Tell the gunners to shoot the horses first. The Takeda cavalry cannot fight without horses.
