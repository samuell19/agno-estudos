Since I was a little girl. I want to tell stories. Really? What kind? I don’t know. I guess... kind of personal stuff. You know, maybe about how a person feels because... their parents... are no longer around. Sorry about that. (horn honks) I miss them... a lot. Sometimes it hurts so bad, I don’t want to care about anyone again. You know what? You should be walking on this side of the street. Why? Is that some kind of macho thing? No, it’s just, you know, the gentleman should walk on the side with the traffic. That way, if a car, like, splashes mud or jumps the curb, he can push the woman out of the way.

I should have known better than to go to that party. Wait. You guys haven’t been here all night, have you? No. We just got here a little early. We didn’t want to miss goin’ to school with you. I see. Look, you guys, I don’t think you should go to school with me. I think people are getting suspicious. -Uh, well, that... That’s cool. -Yeah. Yeah. We understand. Um, is Lauri home? DORIS: No. She had an early class. Are you guys okay? You look a little... pale. A little washed out. Washed out? DORIS: Well, I don’t know. Anyway, if you guys get bored, there’s a park, like, two blocks that way. So I’ll see you later on. 2:30 p.m... Showtime. BILL: I knew it. She’s right. We are fading. FAT ALBERT: Stop worrying.

I’m on volume 22. But I thought you were dumb. Well, that’s when I was a cartoon. I’m actually feeling pretty smart now. And I bet I’ll feel even smarter without this dumb-lookin’ hat. Oh, you’ve got a nice face. I do? I do! I have a nice face! No. Shh. No! Everybody, look! I got a nice face! -No. I’m so sorry. Shh! -Everybody, I have a nice face! DORIS: No!

(chuckles) Hey, man, your colors. They’re fading. You need to chill with that bleach, man. I’ll see you later. -Oh, no. -What’s wrong? It’s gettin' worse. We’re not just losing our color. Look at my hand. I can see through it. It’s fading away. I’m scared. -I wanna go home. -Me too. (screaming) Oh! My goodness. Oh, my. I can see his behind. My behind? So that’s what one looks like. Looks like it’s broken. Let’s go. We have a problem to fix. Uh, surround him. We can’t let anybody see his behind. I told y’all. We gotta get back to where we belong. Let’s go. -BUCKY: Where are we going? -FAT ALBERT: To the junkyard. (panting) BOY: You come back here, you! Get over here! -I’m not done with you yet! -(grunts) (grunts) (shouts mockingly) Come out of there, you little thing, you! (growls softly) Okay by me. I can stay here until the show starts.

DORIS: What happened to his face? He always wore a hat in the cartoon, so nobody ever drew him a whole face. BUCKY: Put the hat on, Dumb Donald! Put the hat on! Ah, that was a close one. Well, well, well. -Interesting, right? -Yeah. All right. Well, who’s next? How about you? Oh, uh, I’ve decided, uh, I’m gonna have to stay. BILL: No, you’re not. No. You’re not. -Dori-- -MALE NEWSREADER: We interrupt this program to bring you a special news broadcast. No! You missed it again. FAT ALBERT: Hey, hey, hey. We can make it another day. And how do you know? Have you ever faded before? Oh, we’ll be fine. You don’t care if we're fine. All you care about is staying here with Lauri. Lauri is important to me. Maybe it’s time I started caring about myself. I don’t even know who you are anymore. Hey, hey, hey. I said I’m gonna stay. Hey, hey, hey! Friends don’t let friends fade away. Don’t use my lines on me. Besides, I haven’t solved Doris’ problem yet. But I don’t have a problem! Yes, you do! -No, I don’t! -What, you think I came all the way out of the TV -just for you to tell me you don’t have a problem? -I don’t have a problem. -You were just sittin’ there watching a happy, fun TV show. -I’m fine!

LAURI: I got some free passes for the fair tonight. Albert, do you want to go? That would be fantastic. How about you, Doris? Will you come? I don’t know. Please? Okay. FAT ALBERT: I just need tonight. Just one night. One last night with Lauri. Well, I’m gonna meet you at the girls’ house. I told Lauri I’d pick her up at the library. I feel really bad for him. Let’s make his last night here one he’ll always remember. How about one all of us will remember? BILL: You’re right. Well, we’re gonna need some wheels. I mean, we’ve got to ride to the fair in style. (tires screeching) (girls laughing) Ladies, your chariot awaits. It’s okay. Rudy, have you lost your mind? Albert... (chuckles) Let’s roll. Uh, you mean start it up? Yep. (Bill making engine noises) Doris.

We’re having a good time. That’s all I want to know. This is so much fun. And thanks for winning this for me. Hey, hey, hey. Anytime, any day. These have been two of the greatest days of my life. How come Fat Albert and Rudy have girls, and I just have you? Are you sure they don’t want something? Oh, they don’t eat. I mean, they don’t eat much. Albert sure looks like he eats. So, um... are you ready for the track meet tomorrow? Do you think they’re sick? They look kind of washed out to me. No. No, that’s just too much bleach in their clothes. Hey, Albert, if you like Lauri, you gotta take her on a roller coaster. That’s the best thing to take a girl on, because while the ride is goin’ on, they get so scared, they want you to hold ’em. And then when the roller coaster goes around the corner, -they fall up against you and everything. -(both laughing) Okay, watch me. Okay, say you’re a girl and you’re on a roller coaster. I’m not sayin' I’m a girl on a roller coaster. What’s wrong with you, man? Why don’t you say you're a girl on a roller coaster by yourself? I’m just tryin' to show Albert something. (indistinct chatter) RUDY: Where’d Albert go? Oh, he-- He’s with the girls. Lauri... you wanna go on the roller coaster? Sure. (giggles) Huh. (chuckles) Go, Albert. (all screaming) (whimpering) (muttering) (screaming) -Can I ask you a question? -Sure. (sighs) If I didn’t have to go back... I mean, if I was a real person, would you... Would I what? Would you go out with me? (chuckles) -You mean, like, on a date? -Yeah. But we are on a date. That’s right. Cool. You were so scared. I wasn’t scared. I just looked scared... -Mm-hmm. -...’cause my cheeks were wrapped around my ears, and my eyelids went up over my head and everything. Wanna go again? Um, you-- You go ahead. Mm. (giggles) Be right back. -You’re Fat Albert! -Hey, hey, hey. What are you doin’ here? You’re supposed to be on TV. These bad kids keep chasing Russell. He needs you. We all need you.

I know. Who’s Fat Albert? (jingling) I think this is the real thing. He’s charming, bright... a gentleman. And he’s the first guy I’ve met in a long time... I feel I can trust. The kind of guy that will always be here for me. (riders screaming) ANNOUNCER: Get one ring on the bottle, and you win a prize! Nobody’s a loser. Everybody’s a winner. (sighs) (groans) People wait till you get to the top of the stairs, then they knock. -Who is it! -FAT ALBERT: It’s Fat Albert. Yeah, right. Hello. Uh, I’m looking for Mr. Cosby. Are you his dad? Uh, I’m-- I'm Fat Albert. (groans softly) Whoa! Uh... Help! He-- I’m sorry, Mr. Cosby. I didn’t mean to startle you. -You okay? -No, that’s all right, son. Thank you. My boy, how did you get into this predicament? Well, I-- I-- I crawled out of the TV set. Crawled out of the TV set. Uh, well, how? I-- I crawled out of there because I heard her crying. -Who-- Who’d ya heard? -Well, I heard Doris. -Doris. -She was sitting on the couch, and she was crying. Doris who? Uh, Doris Robertson. Doris Robertson? Yeah. Do you know where they live? Uh, North Philly. Oh. Albert Robertson... is Doris Robertson’s grandfather. He died some time ago. I designed your character after Albert Robertson. And you heard her spirit... and you crawled through the set? I... I guess so. Well, that’s just fine, son. All you have to do is you just crawl back into the set. -We’re ready to go. -I don’t want to go back into the set. -Hey, hey, hey. -Yeah, hey, hey, hey. I want to stay! Oh, ho, ho. No, you can’t do that. See, you’re a cartoon. You’re a cartoon, and you have your fellas waiting for you to do more stories. Your fans are waiting to see you on TV so you can solve problems. Oh, no, I don’t want to go back into the TV. What do you mean, you don’t want to go back? -No, I want to stay here in the real world. -You can’t-- You can’t stay out here. You stay out here, you’re gonna turn into celluloid dust. (Fat Albert grunting) Lauri. Albert? What are you doing here? Uh, I need to talk to you. I’ll meet you downstairs. (grunts) (groans) Oh. Oh, Lord. (screaming) (muttering) -LAURI: Oh, my. -Lauri... (groans) (door opens) Albert? Are you okay? Hey, hey, hey. Fallin’ is easy. It’s gettin' up that’s the hard part. -Now just... Just roll me over. No. Don’t take me. -Okay. Grab onto my-- Oh! You’re tickling me. (laughing) (mutters) (grunts) Whoo. Ah. So, what’s this about? Uh, well, I came here to tell you that I can no longer be your BFF. I can only be your BFUT. BFUT? Yeah, "best friend until tomorrow." What are you talking about? All right, I don’t just look like Fat Albert. -I am Fat Albert. -So? -I’m really the guy in the cartoon. -Cartoon? The Fat Albert show. You know, "hey, hey, hey." It-- It’s a cartoon. See, when I told you I would stay forever, I didn’t know that I was fading. Now I’m this fading cartoon character, and if I don’t go back into the TV, I’m gonna turn into a big pile of powdered celluloid. You know, it’s almost funny. Every time someone says they care about me, they wind up leaving me. No, no, Lauri. Wait. No, Lauri. Lauri! You-- You can’t let fear keep you from caring about someone. -Albert. -Yes? Get some help. -Wait-- Lauri, wait-- -(door closes) How could you possibly believe that Albert’s a cartoon character? It’s all true, Lauri. Doris, no one came out of our TV set. Those guys, Albert’s friends, they’re very strange. I think they could be some kind of cult. -Someday you’ll understand. -What I understand... is that we have a track meet tomorrow, so let’s go to sleep. (applause) CHEERLEADERS: Go, AHS, yeah! (grunts) ANNOUNCER: Runners, take your marks! Set! (crowd cheering) (cheerleaders cheering) -Nice race. -Thanks. Come on, guys. Hurry up! The bad guys are comin’ back for a buck-buck buck-off!

Well, Doris, if I ever come back out of that TV, then, I’ll be calling you. I’ll be waiting. (zapping) FAT ALBERT: Okay, Bill, you’re next. (laughing) Arthur, learn the handshake. Why don’t you go first? I just need a moment alone with Doris. See you in the junkyard. (zapping) Hey, Russell, you know what? I’m actually happy to see you. Oh, yeah? Well, I’m still telling Mom on you. Well, uh, I guess I have to go back to the way I was. But if I could stay, I would be so happy to be the best that I was capable of being. It’s funny. It seems like I know you... have known you... for a long time. Maybe you have. Maybe you have. All right. Come on now. We gotta get you back to the track. (clears throat) You got a relay race to run. Go for it. Come on, Fat Albert! We need you! (indistinct chatter) -BILL: Come on, Fat Albert. -No, not yet. I finally understand why I had to come out here. Don’t. You won't be back in time. You cannot last another day. I have to help her. It’s time for Doris to believe in herself again. BILL: You’re fading, man! You cannot-- (TV turns off) Guys, listen up. Now, we win this relay, we win the meet. All right? -Yori, you’re first leg as usual. -All right. Lisa, I’m taking you off of third leg and putting you on second leg. -Okay. -BOY: Go, Lisa! Lauri, you’re third leg. And, Doris, you’re anchor. All right, come on! Let’s do this now! ALL: Go, Archers! COACH: Yeah, come on, guys! Anchor? But you’re always anchor.

If there’s any way that I can, I will. But in the meantime, we’ll always have North Philly. And I’ll always have my Big Al. Albert, wait! I finally figured out who you remind me of. You remind me of my grandpa. Hey, hey, hey. That’s a nice thing to say. I love you, Doris. (sighs) I love you too. BUCKY (on TV): What is that? A piece of paper? BILL (on TV): No, man. That’s a paper clip. I’ll see you girls through the TV. -BUCKY (on TV): Whoa! Yes! -(grunts) -(grunting continues) -We have ’em! We're the buck-buck champions! -We still have ’em. -FAT ALBERT: Okay, lift. Okay, now push. -Now push together. -(girls grunting) Fa-a-a-a-t Albert! He loves to hear us call his name. (loud thudding) Hey, hey, hey. Who wants to play? Oh, no! (all shouting) MR. MUDFOOT: Fat Albert, you got a problem to solve. I just saw Danielle. She said she was quittin’ school and running away from home. FAT ALBERT: Hey, Danielle. What do you want? -You can’t quit school and run away. -What’s it to you? Well, I care about you. Well, don’t. Every time someone says they care about me, they wind up leaving me. But, Danielle, you can’t let fear, um... He better not be doing this again. You can’t let fear keep you from caring about someone, because caring about someone is wonderful. A person you can think about, and they think about you, and you both know you’re thinking about each other. And it’s... It’s just fantastic to know that there’s somebody out there in the world thinking about you. (indistinct chatter) (jug band music playing) Hey, hey, hey! It’s Fa-a-a-a-t Albert! FAT ALBERT: Oh, my legs! (indistinct chatter) Hey! Hey! Hey! Let go of my legs! Grab his socks! Let go of my legs! I gotta help these people. Why, look at that guy. Ooh, look at his-- Yeah, you can’t tell me he doesn’t need my help. Check out that lady over there. Do I detect tears? Eh, you in the back! Where are you goin’? It’s not over! You gotta watch the end credits.
