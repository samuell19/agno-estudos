Man has always been arrogant. From the moment we emerged, evolved and standing upright... we became the masters of our destiny. With each step we moved on, ever forward. Seldom looking back at the destruction we left in our way. The answers would come tomorrow. Tomorrow. Always tomorrow. Somehow they seemed safer there. We stacked them up as if to protect us from the inevitable. But everyone forgot that tomorrow always comes. And when it did we weren't prepared. It swept through the land, toppling nations until... the world was awash in a great silence. Only then did we see what we had done. Only then did we see the price of our arrogance. Yet, the human race is best when things are at their worst. In our darkest hour destiny always forces someone to step forward. Even if he never planned to. Freeze! Having fun again? I told you to freeze it. - Do you know what that feels like? - It doesn't feel like anything. There's no physical interaction involved with holographs. Whatever. Run it back. I wanna see what he pushed behind the desk. The cameras were mounted diagonally. We can't include anything obstructed from it?s original view. The wonders of technology. Scott, you know Lt. Grier - You saw the tape? - Yeah. What do you think? I think he's dead. There's nothing funny about this. This is agent Walters. W.J.D. What does the World Justice Dept. Have to do with this? The victim was Dr. F. Reyna... - I know, Absolon. - That 's right. That still doesn't answer my question. The dept. Is very interested in seeing that the killer is found. This is a universal warrant, it'll get you in wherever you want. Put your team together and get on this right away. Prison entry codes are no longer viable. Override. Norman Scott. 2372. Identification confirmed. Proceed. You have one message. Mr. Scott this is the phone company. Please call us back. - You have one saved message. - Hi, baby it's me. I'm gonna stay for a few more days. I'll call you later. I love you. Neurological degeneration syndrome is a new... unknown medical illness. As it is air born... the infection will reach epidemic levels by the end of the year. The virus has two stages. Stage one consists of contraction and incubation. Stage two is a deterioration of the neurological pathways. Once stage two has been entered death follows within 2 or3 days. A virus living undisturbed on the floor of the rainforest for eons. When we destroyed the rainforest it was swept up into the air. What arrogance! To think we could change that which took millions of years to create. - Are you sure you want to do this? - Yes. I want it documented. I am born. Whether I shall turn out to be the hero of my life... or whether that station will be held by anyone else... these pages must show. In thinking of her, pointing upward. Pointing to that sky above me... where in the mystery to come... I may yet love her with a love not known on earth and... Sarah. Sarah! You have 147 seconds of hot water remaining in today's allotment. You are 7 hours delinquent from your Absolon schedule. Please initiate you weekly neurological analysis. Cell integrity is good. Neurological levels stable. Immunization is at 83% . Proceed. Dr. Frederick Reyna. P.H.D. M.D. And a bunch of other letters. Modern day saint. The world leader in botanical chemistry. He won the Earth Humanitarian award in 2OO7... for isolating the N.D.S. Virus. And again in 2O14 for his work on the Absolon project. After that there's not much on him. Maybe there is. I found this at Reyna. It 's encrypted, try to break it. Who's financing the guy? He got a grant from Unified Pharmaceutical Corp. Dr. Whitaker. I'm Dt. Scott... and this is Dt. Brian. We need to ask you some questions. - How well did you know Dr. Reyna. - He was my professor. He convinced me to go into research. - So you were friends? - I don't think he had any friends. Meaning? That He was brilliant but he wasn't easy to get along with. - What was he working on? - Nothing worth killing over. But your company was still funding him. You don't pull a grant from the man who discovered Absolon. Of course. We found an encoded disc in his study. - Do you have the key charge for it? - He was very secretive about work. - Give it to us and we'll decode it. - We have people who can do that. They could also erase very valuable data. Didn't you say he wasn't working on anything important? No, I said he wasn't working on anything worth killing over. All research data is important. You never know where it can lead. - We'd like to look at his lab. - It isn't here. He liked to work outside the corporate structure. Thank you. One more thing. Can you tell us where you were last night? I was here until 9:3O and then I went home. - Anything else? - Not for now. Thank you Doctor. Thank you. You account will be debited in fifteen minutes. Could we go somewhere where we can sit down? What? You don't like dining here. Dining! You call this dining? What do you expect from a guy who makes my wage? - A chair. - Touch?. - What 's next? - Reyna's lab. Hey, Mister. Could you spare some time. We can't help him. He's already stage two. Take a look around here, I'm gonna check out the rest of the place. My name's Scott. I'm a police officer. Daniel Heywood. I was Dr. Reyna's assistant. I know it 's a difficult time for you... For me! We will all suffer for his death. We'll suffer because things are gonna stay the same. - Just the way they want them. - They! Who are they? Do you know why he was killed? Because of this. - A garden? - It 's a pharmacy not a garden. To some it 's a cash register. N.D.S. Is big business. - We're all slaves to Absolon. - Yeah! - Without it we'd all be dead. - Good for you Mr. Police officer. You take your Absolon everyday. You go to your job. - You live your life. - That 's the way it is. They control us. Our currency is time allotments of life. 22 minutes for a loaf of bread. 8 hours for a bike. - You go broke and you're dead. - And Reyna wanted to change it. He never intended it to be used this way. Absolon was a death sentence. - He died for what we created. - I don't understand the connection. Absolon must be taken everyday to inhibit the diseases progression. He was working on a cure for N.D.S. Excuse me. Hey, Scott. Take a look at these printouts. We got this off Reyna's lab tape. Look at the killers face. It 's been digitally altered. Look at his eyes. - Maybe an imperfection on the tape. - I thought so too but check it out. It moves with the eyes... where as an imperfection would stay still. The medical examiner sent this over. - This isn't possible! - It 's not. - What do we do now? - Heywood. Wait here. Daniel, it 's Scott. We spoke earlier today. I know you're in there Mr. Heywood. - Ruth, keep your ears open. - I'm on it. I know why you're afraid. I'm not here to hurt you. - What do you want? - I want to help you. You can't help me, I'm a dead man. - I know that Reyna found a cure. - Then you're a dead man too. - What happened? - What is that? - It 's a radio link to my partner. - I'm not talking to your partner. Alright. I'll take it off. Ok. It 's off. I don't know how but they found out. - Who killed Reyna? - Unified pharmaceuticals. The government. Effectively they're the same thing. Remember when N.D.S. First appeared? Bodies in the streets. Governments fell and economies collapsed. Our economy is based on Absolon and those who provide it... won't allow it to become worthless. And the cure? Can't you just give it to people? No. We're complex. We're the same species but not identical organs. - I'm not a scientist. - What 's your blood type? - O. - I'm AB-. We maybe allergic to different things. We're not all exactly the same. It 's tea. Hydroponics. We used to grow it here. It 's good. - Where's the cure now? - It 's hidden. - Where? - In a safe place. There are two people passing the building. It's probably nothing. You have to trust someone. - I wanna help you. - Scott. There's nothing you can do here. Go home Pretend that you know nothing and maybe they'll leave you alone. - Are you OK? - No. - You did a good job tonight. - What are you talking about? We found this. It 's the gun that killed Reyna. - He didn't kill anyone. - Looks to us like he did. Maybe he wasn't working alone and the others thought that he'd talk. What 's going on here? - What do you think is going on? - I don't know but I will find out. Now if you'll excuse me, it 's been a long night. Go home and rest. Things will look clearer tomorrow. Wake up. You've used 8 hours 15 minutes of your sleep allotment. Scott! Can I have a word with you? - What are you doing here? - I need to speak with you. - You don't look good this morning. - I'm fine. I've got a headache. It won't last long. Get in! Get in if you want to live. Go! Agent Walters, return to Mr. Murchison's office now. I send you out to do a simple thing. A simple thing by definition... should not be difficult to accomplish. You have allowed that simple thing to become a complex thing. He was lucky. I don't believe in luck. I believe we create our own destinies. And you, through your inaptitude... have opened the door for Norman Scott to create his. - I'll find him. - I don't doubt that. But when will you find him. And how many people will he tell before you do? He won't go to the media. He knows we'll be waiting for that. I see. So you Would say... - that he's an intelligent man? - Yes, Sir. - Resourceful man? - Yes. And you have chosen him for this assignment! No, Sir. The W.J.D. Doesn't have jurisdiction over this case. If I'd interfered with this case it would have looked suspicious. Reyna's is dead. His assistant is dead. An attempt has been made on the life of the investigating officer. Things already look suspicious. This was supposed to be neat. Now it 's a mess. Clean it up. And do it quickly. - What is going on here? - They want you dead. That much I've already figured out. Why? Because you know. What 's happening to me? - You need to sleep. - No. I need answers. Did Heywood tell you he'd hid the cure. - Do you know where? - Yes. In you. What? You have all the symptoms. Fever, paleness, labored breathing. You have a headache, spasms. It began after your injection. - Your body's rejecting the Absolon. - What! I can't live without it. Take another injection and you'll die. Your blood is changing. Producing anti-toxins. In three days you'll go into stage two. Stage two is fatal. Then you need the second part of the cure. There's a second part! For safety no one person was allowed both parts. - One of Reyna's colleagues has it. - Where is he? He's in hiding. So I have three days to find him or I'm dead! You die and the cure dies. Primary satellite transmission in fifteen seconds. Target is locked. Up-link will last seven minutes. Why me? Everyone went underground after Reyna died. - Daniel had nowhere to turn. - He could have taken it himself. He new that he would be killed... and his blood was AB-. The host 's body's blood cells have to be type O. - A universal donor. - It was in the tea. - Why didn't you tell me before. - How? I didn't know you. Just knowing about this is a death warrant. - Who are they? - W.J.D. Watch out! They don't have to kill us you're gonna do it for them. Watch out! Please! - Give me the gun. - What? Give me the gun! Yes. Nice shot. Watch it! I'm afraid he's escaped and he has Claire Whitaker with him. Define "with him". She's helping him. Should have taken care of her when you had the chance. Hi, I just wanted to remind you about our lunch today. - Are you ready for some burritos? - What? Yeah I am. I'll see you in an hour. - All set. - Thank you. Her boss gets angry... - Whatever. - Yeah, whatever. Play it back. What? Yes I am, I'll see you in an hour. There's a high stress factor in her voice. Davis. Get on her and stay on her. They can't trace you on this one. - You look like shit. - Thanks. - What 's she doing here? - Helping me. - Walters tried to kill me. - Why? - Heywood hid the cure in me. - What do you mean in you? In my blood. I have three days to find the second half or I'm dead. - Can I come in? - There's a warrant out for you. For what? The two guys at Reyna's lab were undercover W.J.D. Agents. Bullshit! It was a set up. I know but I was out of contact and couldn't hear what was happening. - They say Heywood killed Reyna. - I know. It 's impossible his eyes don't match. Stay on the desk. Hold on. Try using binary codes to reduce the data table in the charts. OK. - Watch yourself. - You too. How's it going Ruthy? - How's it going with the photos? - Grier said the case was closed. What 's going on? All this business about the medical examiner. What business? He was found him behind a dumpster on State St. Somebody snapped his neck. Are these the autopsy reports? This can't be right. How did this escalate in to what it is, John? When Heywood died we thought it was over. Only after we tested him did we know he hadn't taken it. We didn't think he'd give the drug to Scott. When you think about it it was very clever. - Why did you suspect Scott? - Only he had contact with Heywood. And his blood type is O. Once Scott is producing the antibodies and the cure... is being given to others, will they be able to produce it. Only the host body can produce the antibodies. Then our course is very clear. Thank you for your help Doctor. Find him, and this time don't screw up. Kill him. - We think his partner knows. - Good. Then use her. It doesn't matter what she knows, Just what she can prove. And she can prove nothing. She's just a voice in the wind. - Hello. - It 's me. Reyna's autopsy has been changed to normal readings. They're trying to cover up. I decoded the disc. It 's a list of addresses and security codes. - Can you read them to me? - It 's not safe here. - I think I'm being followed. - Well then get somewhere safe. I'm heading home and I'll call you when I get there. Back up. Be quiet. Be still. - It isn't here. - Where is it? - Where's what? - What you printed off your computer. It was a shopping list. I threw it away. Cute. Listen to me very carefully. Tell me what I want to know. - Screw you! - Where is it? Where's what? I called Scott and read it to him over the phone. - What was it? - Some numbers. They were only numbers. They're with you. You're wasting your time. I deleted it. That 's too bad. - I want to speak to you. - Yes, Sir. What would happen if... Scott took the second part of the cure before he hit stage two? It wouldn't work. If we could get him and the second part of the cure... before he becomes stage two. - Could you produce the cure? - I believe so. Why would you do that? I'm only exploring options, our first priority is to capture him. But after that. If we could produce the cure It 'd be nice to have. - Wouldn't it be very dangerous? - Some risks are worth taking. Who would decide who gets the cure and who doesn't? I would, John. I would. - Anybody see anything? - Nothing. I want to know what the hell's going on? - You know as much as I do. - I don't think that 's true. There's more to this than just Reyna's murder. - I want some answers. - I don't have any for you. I know this is rough with one cop on the run and another dead. But I will do ever thing I can to find out who killed her. - You have my word. - We've got a pulse. - Captain, how is she? - She's got a good chance. We won't be able to talk to her for a while. - So I'll need your help. - Yes, of course. Were they working on anything outside the ring of murder? Not that I know of. Scott was so sure that Heywood couldn't have killed Reyna. Do you know why? - What color were his eyes? - Blue, why? Good job, Ruthy. It 's a list of safe houses. Reyna made it for situations like this. The second part of the cure is in one of these places? Let 's go! Freeze! Move! You pushed me off a bridge. - I would have jumped! - Good. What is this place? I've heard this is where stage two victims come. It 's called the boundary. You folks are along way from home. - We're lost. - I'd say. People around here call me Doc. - When's the next satellite pulse. - About three hours. There's a couple of spare cots. You're welcome to spend the night. Thanks. I hope you like my cooking. It 's good. - Are you... - Stage two? No, I've got Absolon. Why do you live here? For them. The care I give isn't much but it 's better than nothing. And the people who aren't stage two. - Do any get back to the city? - Precious few. Once you're that far down it 's hard to climb back up. It 's crazy that conditions like this still exist. We're supposed to be an evolved species. We haven't evolved. Technology has. It 's only took 2OO years to destroy what took billions to create. - You're against technology? - I'm against it 's consequences. - Every action has a consequence. - We're paying for our actions now. Do you think that N.D.S. Is an accident? Go ahead. It 's made naturally. You two get some sleep. I've got some choirs to do. Thank you. That 's quite a set up. - Sorry I didn't mean to scare you. - That 's OK. These are my boys. This is Adam and David. This is Claire. That 's all for today. Go outside and play. See you later incubator. I don't know about their parents. The woman who brought them here died... and so I decided to raise them myself. It 's very interesting isn't it? Dr. Whitaker. - How did you know my name? - This maybe the last frontier... but we do have television. That 's quite a reward they put up for you two. - It could buy you a lot of Absolom. - I thought about that. But I didn't know if you did what they say you did. What happens over there doesn't matter much here. I'd like to show you something. Do you know what that is? It 's the chemical structure of N.D.S. And this? The chemical structure of Absolon. - Incredibly similar, aren't they? - They have to be. Absolom is a mutated form of the virus. Correct. Now look at the gene 25 graph on Adams chart. I don't get your point. His levels are normal because... - the Absolon is controlling them. - Adam's never taken Absolon. - That 's not possible. - He's immune to N.D.S. Have you tested these results against any subjects? Over one hundred. A natural immunity! It 's there I just can't locate it. I was wondering would... - you like to stay and help me? - I can't. There could be something in him that could cure us all. - I'm sorry. I can't stay. - No harm in asking. - Good morning. - Morning. I think it 's starting. I don't think so. - I feel really stiff. - So do I. We jumped of a bridge into a truck last night, remember? Until you get the cure you will get weaker. Look. The list has eight addresses. - Sounds good. What 's first? - Randal St. Got it. Address located. We can be there in an hour. - Hi. - Hi. - How's it going? - Doc says I'm sick. I see. And I'm gonna die. - Did Doc tell you that? - He doesn't have to. I know what happens to kids when they get sick like me. Let me show you something. - What 's that? - It 's my good luck charm. I always carry it with me. Protects me where ever I go. - Did you ever meet him? - I believe in some ways I did. It was a different time. You know I think he's coming back. And you'll get to meet him. - Do you want it? - Are you serious? Sure. See you later, David. - Won't you change your mind? - I'd like to stay but... I can't. Straight ahead. Looks like you made a friend. - Time to go home. - Follow me. - We've lost the satellite signal. - Well get it back, now. It 's the old sewer. It leads to the city. Just keep to the left. - What about you? - I'll be alright. Good luck. Thanks. Do we have a problem here? Then step back. I need a fix on his last location. It 's starting but it'll pass, just try to relax. We need to go somewhere. You don't need Absolon, but I do. - Your right but where? - The dispensary. We can't use credit they'll find us. Then what do we do? Let 's go. Hi. - Better? - I'll need to get more. - What do you want? - Answers. - I don't have any. - You're disappointing me. And I'm not in the mood for it. How long have you been in Unified Pharmaceutical's pocket? I don't have to tell you what a cop makes. I don't want to retire counting my time units and wondering... If I have enough to buy Absolon for the rest of my life. - Why put me on the case? - Because you do a good job. Cute. Why not you? I don't do field work anymore. I would have looked suspicious. Which brings me back to why me? We had to do it by the book. Follow procedure. Walters wanted someone easily controlled. I didn't know I was easily controlled. Not in that sense. We knew that the investigator could learn about the cure. He might decide to try and help them. - Walters wanted... - Walters wanted what? Someone who had no life. No family, no relationships, a few friends. Someone who'd be easy to find if he ran. They'll find you. This is not like the alley. We're not playing with you anymore. How long do you think you can stay out here? - Alone. - Long enough. Authorities are still looking for Norman Scott... in connection with the murder of two W.J.D. Officers last night. A one year award is being offered for his arrest. Scott's partner was found at her apartment yesterday. The victim of a knife attack. She is in a critical condition at an undisclosed hospital. She's alive. She still has a chance. - Should I question your abilities? - I'll get him. - He's only one man. - A man who's a cause... to fight for that makes him very dangerous. When will he be able to take the second part of the drug? Tomorrow evening. Then how long before he can produce the antibodies? I'm not sure but I'd guess a few hours. I want him found. And Mr. Walters, I've changed my mind. I want him alive. - You have one message. - Hi baby, it's me. I'm gonna stay at my moms for a few more days. I love you. They found us again. They're tracking us somehow. You don't seem very concerned and that bothers me. I don't know how they found us and we have more important priorities. Take off your hair clip. Come on! And your watch. You could have a devise on you that you don't know about. Empty your pockets. Anything else? Strip. In front of me. This is a universal warrant. Wait. I'm sorry. - The next on the list is Wilton Dr. - Let 's go. Go out the back and I'll be right behind you. There on the second floor. Get moving. - I have the woman in the alley. - It 's about time. You sure have some nice toys. At least we can still track them. He found the device you idiot. She is weak. Her lung was punctured so it 's hard for her to talk. You have two minutes. How are you doing. - Scott? - He's alright as far as we know. Do you know what 's going on? Reyna. Cure for N.D.S. - He was working on a cure? - Found one. Who did this to you? Walters. We'll stay at this safe house tonight. They'll have Absolon here. There's something sad about you. Sad? I'm not sad. - Dying maybe but not sad. - I see you on your phone... when you call someone but you don't say anything... and just look sad. It 's my wife, on the phone. It 's my wife. She left one day saying she was going to see her Mom. She never came back. The message is the last time she talked to me. - She died, right? - Yes. N.D.S. I'm sorry. It was a long time ago. Some things are never a long time ago. You are exceeding your water allotment. Not anymore. I saw what you did for that little boy. When I was ten my father gave me that card. Maybe it was just my imagination but when I looked at it... I felt better. Stronger. I thought that kid needed it more than I did. Are we done being neighbors for now? No... we're not. I recovered the file. She only did a surface deletion. I'm sick of this man. Bring him to me. I want some of his time before I hand him over. What are you looking at? You killed Reyna. What are you talking about? The tape in Reyna's study. The killer wore a mask. We tracked in on the right eye. - It was brown with a yellow speck. - You think I killed Reyna? - How many people have those eyes? - Why would I? Don't you think that when Murchison found out about Reyna's cure... he would know that he couldn't have done it without my help. Reyna and his work are my life I didn't do this. They killed him and I was supposed to be framed for it. - Heywood was framed for it. - After they realized that... there were two serums not one. Do you believe me? Get dressed. We've got to move. The next closest place is Bridge St. Isn't that Reyna's lab? - They wouldn't be there. - Yeah, that 's not... In the car. You don't want innocent people to get hurt. Let 's check them. Hold on! Hey, you guy. Davis here. We've got them. You can call off the others. Excuse me Sir. Get out of the car please. - Is there a problem? - Get out of the car. - What 's your name? - What has he done? I'm not talking to you. White. Alan White. Do you have any identification? - I left home in a hurry. - What is this about? Come with me, Sir. - We have an important meeting. - It'll have to wait. - It can't wait. Officer. - Don't argue with me. OK. Let me. There's nowhere to go Scott. Come out now and I won't kill the girl. What took you so long? Watch out! Oh no you don't. Come on. Why did you bring him here? What the hell is going on. When Reyna started work on the cure, we new it could be dangerous. We planned. Made elaborate precautions but... After he took the second part he came here to tell us the results. He passed out. We ran some tests. They showed no trace of Absolon and no sign of N.D.S. The result were sent to Murchison. So they killed Reyna and took his notes thinking that would end it. But his notes said that he had made enough for two trails. Yours and mine. - I'm just a decoy. - I'm afraid so. - Do I even have the cure in me? - Yes you do. Don't minimize your contribution. Without you we wouldn't have had the time to work safely. - What happens now? - You've been given the second part. We needed someone with the ability to elude Murchison. Your medical records provided the rest. What if I didn't elude him? It didn't matter, they would have assumed the cure died with you. And we would have had enough time to run our tests. What does it mean? Your body isn't producing the anti-toxins yet. When it is, it'll turn blue. - What do we do? - We wait. We wait! We wait for what? Target is here. Check him. I have him. Alive. I can't say how disappointed I am. So I'll show you. No! He had the cure in him. Clever. I'm chasing Scott all over town and it 's right under my nose. He really did have the cure. Isn't it ironic that he dies while Scott lives. Come on! The clock is ticking and time is everything today. Test Scott. If you kill him you'll kill the cure. Well. I guess we've got some time on our hands. And after we've killed some time. It 's all lies! Reyna invented a cure for Absolon not N.D.S. Why? Because there is no N.D.S. Anymore, is there? The virus died out years ago. When someone goes into stage two they're not dying of N.D.S. They're dying because they can't live without Absolon. It just produces the same symptoms. Your disgusting! I'm a realist... and a pragmatist. Where did Stewart keep his notes? - You killed Reyna. - I beg your pardon. Oh no, actually Walters killed him. With my blessing of course. Lets get on with this... I don't want to educate them about the new world order. - At last, I believe it's time. - Who's gonna do the procedure? Don't be silly. You are. Or Mr. Walters is going to hurt you very badly. And when we're finished here... There'll be no trace left of this place. Now get on with it. We don't need his body, just his blood. Drain it. Time's up! What's going on? What the hell is going on? Walters! Don't you fail me again! Kill him! Kill him! - Kill him! - Shut the fuck up! Not for long, looser. So long. No one knows what happened to them after they gave the World the cure. Many still wanted him dead for the gift he gave us. He gave the world a second chance. I don't know if we deserve it but because of him we have it. Did you ever meet him? Just once. Just for a moment.
