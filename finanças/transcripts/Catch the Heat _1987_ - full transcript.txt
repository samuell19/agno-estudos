Number one. As promised. We only deal China White. Toss me the money, honey. Catch, honey. Where did you get the stuff? Little green elf. You know, I'm sad to say I never made it with a China chick. Neither have I. Let me make you a deal. $200 for 10 minutes of your time. Even plumbers don't make that. Honey, | don't do it for money. Let me make you another deal. Ass on the grass, baby. Gonna mow your lawn. Whatever happened to foreplay? Let's go to the truck. Okay. The rucksack. Strip! Come on, it's freezing tonight. Do you want goosebumps, or what? Now! Okay! Are you window shopping or buying? Let's get in the goddamn truck. -| guess they told you. -Told me what? About my oral hang-up. You think I'm stupid enough to buy that shit? Big Boy believes me. You figure I'll turn this dumb bastard on, and while he's huffing and puffing... you'll grab the gun, right? Where the fuck do you think you're going? Freeze! Make one move, and you're dog meat, fuckhead! Drop the gun! Very good. Turn around and assume the position, Danny Boy. -Now! -Shit! Spread! This isn't going to stick. You can't hang this on me. Isn't this what you call "entrapment"? Keep your goddamn mouth shut! Read him his rights. Button him up! Let's get a tow truck in here. Honey, are you okay? I'm glad to see you're so concerned. What took you so long? He had a gun on you. You could be a hostage right now. You could be dead. We had to wait. Time this just right. Yeah, yeah. Looks like your lawnmower's going into cold storage for a while. Is she one of yours? April fool, motherfucker! Fuck you! Eat that! Al right. Federal agents do not kick people in the head. -This scumbag tried to rape me! -You go home right now. I'll take care of Danny Boy. You go home and cool off! Shit! -You really won her over, didn't you? -Crazy fucking broad! What's her problem? I'll tell you. Some asshole like you raped and murdered her sister. And something like that has a long shelf life. What do you think? Bettman, give me the cassette. Everybody, give me some room. Danny and | are gonna talk. See that? She was wired. You're immortalized, Danny. That's not admissible evidence, Officer. You're very smart, Danny. You're very smart. We're gonna see just how smart you are. This is a hollow point. What's about to happen is gonna be my word against yours. I think you tried to escape... and | was forced to cripple you for life. Now the only thing that's gonna change my mind... is names, Danny. Where do you get the shit from? Now, Danny. Names. What the fuck are you trying to do, man? That was my friend you tried to rape. You give me names, or | give you a vagina. You choose, Danny. | really don't care which one. Thanks. Go ahead. You look very good today. You ever lose? Boots off, Waldo! | don't think there's a lot of use for that on the streets. It's kind of hard to get in and out of cars. Here, I'll help you out with this thing here. You know, I've undressed a lot of women... but this is new. You look good when you sweat. You even smell good. Did he talk? You know what it is with you, | think? You're scared to let yourself get started with me. You know why? Because you know that there's too much potential with me. -Did he tell you where he got the dope? -You know, if you do... you're gone, you know? You're just over the edge. Waldo, has this line... ever gotten you laid, even once? Never. That's why I'm laying it on you, right now. Let me tell you, lately I've noticed you've been coming on to me a lot. Thank you, Waldo, for helping me keep my hands off of you. | was ready to wipe my sweat... all over your magnificent body. Lost for words, Waldo? You should take a cold shower and calm yourself. Then I'm gonna let you drive me to the airport. Airport? -What's at the airport? -Airplanes, to take me to Buenos Aires. Danny Boy elected to talk. Yes, we have a suspect there. His name is Jason Hannibal. I have to go there. We know he's a talent agent... working out of Argentina. Before that he was in the Far East... mostly Thailand. Sounds like you're gonna need me. Come on, give me a break. | got to get down there, | got to.... Jesus! Who taught you to drive? First, | meet our guys at the embassy. They introduce me to local mobs. Then | just begin to work on this case. | send for you as soon as | know what your cover should be. Come on! So how long do | have to wait? I'll send for you just as soon as | can. Listen... try and be good without me, okay? Bye, Waldo. -Waldo? -Yes, hi. Thanks, Willie. | am Raul De Villa. De Villa? Welcome to Argentina. We took these as soon as your officer contacted us. You got right to work. Just another pretty face. You got anything on him? Do you have a record of arrests? Not even a parking ticket. What's a booking agent doing with three heavy-duty types like this? Are you quite sure of your informant in San Francisco? You mean the one that named Hannibal as the supplier? -Frankly, Lieutenant... -Yeah. ...our source sucks. He's a real tarantula. But it's a bent world. He's all we've got. | think we're gonna have to go right along with-- Slowly, please. In English, slowly. | say that we follow Hannibal, even over the Alps. -Wrong. -Why? Over the Andes. Nice to meet you, Lieutenant. Do you like cigars? This is great. | got a partner in San Francisco that hates them. You should have left that thing on the lawn where your dog dropped it. Don't you know that smoking is hazardous for your health? Al right. If there is any trouble, you get the green light to fire. -Okay, you're under arrest! -For smoking a cigar? For dealing shit, asshole! Freeze! Shit. You better buckle up, brother. No! Freeze! All right, spread them. -Are you ready? -Can you give me a couple of minutes? They just finally got me through to San Francisco. San Francisco, from my phone? Haven't you heard about our national debt? Heard about it? You owe it to my bank. I'll reverse the charges. Don't worry. Just give me a couple of minutes. Checkers, where have you been? I've been trying to run you down for an hour. Phone call. Buenos Aires. About time. Hi! Check, how are you doing? You know me, just hanging out. | just took my morning swim. | want you just as soon as you can get down here... but not as "Checkers." What? What do you mean? Why? This is the part you're gonna love. You are coming down here as a dancer. -You always wanted to dance, didn't you? -Yeah, yeah. You're coming down here as a "Cinderella Pu." "Cinderella Pu"? What kind of a cover is that? Cinderella Pu is coming to Buenos Aires... to learn the tango and break into showbiz, okay? No, | don't like that name. Let's change it. I'm sorry, it's too late. Your passport's already in the works. In fact, they want you this afternoon for a passport photo. | want you arriving in one of those slinky Suzie Wong dresses. You know, the ones | like. Sexy, cheap looking. You can manage that, can't you? One more thing, Check. For this one, you're gonna have to be flat-chested. Are you serious? | thought you were a trained observer. Going out there, Cinderella Pu? No way. Oh, boy! Who is it? Who is it? It's Mr. Hum, the friend of Mr. Walts. Cinderella all wet. It's good to know. May | come in? Waldo, thank God you're here. Could you please tell me why they shut the water off? What is today? Is that relevant? If it is Tuesday, they shut off the water at La Boca section. There's a water shortage on. What do you mean, "if it's Tuesday"? You know it's Tuesday! What about the soap in my hair? All right, listen, water or no water, this is home base. The local dope-busters picked it out for us. You got a better room than me again. Are they with us or against us? What kind of an operation is this if a person can't even wash her hair? Enough with the hair. We've got work to do. Take a look at this. "Castello Club, Jose Casaldo." Castello is a local showcase for new talent in town. Zaro runs it, but the important thing is our man, Hannibal, hangs out there... picks up his new talent. Plan A, we get Hannibal to come to you. You go there, you audition, and get a spot in the lineup. He sees you, and he wants you to sign up. This will work because the performers, the dancers, aren't that good. For us, that's great, because I've seen your dancing... and maybe you'll get a job in the chorus or something. Sounds promising. That's terrible, Reggie. Hold it! Not like that. How many times do | have to tell you? Come on, line up. Five, six, seven, eight. Excuse, please. -Mr. Casaldo? -Yeah. I am Cinderella Pu. | sing, | dance-- Yeah, okay, it sounds interesting. Reggie, let's see what this little lady can do. -Okay, Mr. Casaldo. -Come on, girls, clear the stage. -Check it. -You don't trust us? -How is it? -It's perfect. Okay, give him the money. Okay, good. We'll be back, two weeks. Bravo! Yes, that was beautiful. Fine. Now, what do you call that dance? Karate and dance, all in one. -What do you think? -Give me a couple of days with her. I think she can headline that new tango number I've been working on. Tango! Cinderella came all way from Hong Kong just to learn tango! Such good fortune! -How did it go? -I think he took the bait. Come in, Mr. Hannibal. Cinderella, you have an admirer who wishes to meet you. Mr. Hannibal. So honored. Girls here say you top agent in Argentina. You send many of them to North America to sing and dance. Can | tell you something? You remind me of someone... that | was very fond of. Thank you. Here. You call me at my office, and we'll discuss your theatrical career. So sorry. Astrologer tell Cinderella tomorrow day of ill fortune. He say, "Tomorrow, stay in bed all day." "Alone," he say. Alone. I'll tell you what. Would you do me a favor, if it's not asking too much? -When you wake up, would you call me? -Okay, | call. -Maria. -Yes? -Bon voyage, and good luck. -Yes, thank you. Sorry, Mr. Hannibal? | meant to tell you... that | cannot leave tomorrow. I'm sorry. Why not? My doctor says | have to go to the hospital in the morning. Maybe | can leave on Saturday? 1 will call you. -I've seen that chick somewhere. -She's not a chick! She's a Chinese girl whose name is Cinderella. | doubt if you have ever seen her anywhere in the world in your life. Yeah, Mr. Hannibal, but.... New York, maybe? No, she has never been out of Hong Kong. | had Casaldo check her passport. Are they having a party in there? Why is he taking so long? Remember the girl, Maria? Just make sure she doesn't get to her doctor. Maria, is anything wrong? | hear you tell Mr. Hannibal you go to hospital. You sick, Maria? No, I'm all right. Thank you. Then you go to party with Reggie, and all the dancers with Cinderella. | can't. Thank you, you're very kind. -Okay, | take you home. -You don't have to do that. | want to. Cinderella never do something she does not want to do. -You come with me. -Okay, this is so kind of you. There he is, with the heavyweights. Here she comes. She's going off with all those women. She's calling a taxi. | got to find out what went on. You would blow her cover. Blow her cover? That's very good. You've never seen my masher act. Watch this! You girls, take first taxi. Maria and | take next one. I'm in heaven! This is great! You! | saw you in there, you are wonderful! You girls go ahead. Go on, go. You know, you and me, we shine it on. | could make you very happy. Maria, you go in taxi. I'll handle this pig. Cinderella takes care of everything. | know little bit kung fu. You know Gung Fu? | know Mr. Fu! He does my shirts! We got to talk, you know? Ike, the driver, I busted him in New York three years ago for murder. What on earth is he doing here? I'll check it out. Do you think Hannibal knows who he really is? | don't know, but make a pass at me, Waldo, the girls are watching. Girls. I've been waiting a long time for this. You gonna kick me? Only punch you. What the hell was that? Just showing her affection. Okay, my friend... | take you to dinner. -All right, but this time | buy, okay? -Okay. So what do you want? Lobster. -You want what? -Lobster. "Lobster." Yes, lobster. Please, come in. -I fix you some tea. -No, I'll do it. No, you sit down, | take care of everything. Come on, here. This is a nice place you have here, Maria. -Maria, Mr. Hannibal-- -Yes? He looked so mean when you told him you not go tomorrow. Why? Because he spent a lot of time and money on me. You two lovers? No, | meant he bought my ticket for the States. | just wanted to wait to see my doctor first, that's all. I'll go then. Does Mr. Hannibal give you a gift to take with you on trip? Gift? What? What do you mean? You know, presents to take to the people at the hotel. No. Maybe he give you a nice suitcase to take on trip. No, nothing at all. | take you to airport, and I'll wave goodbye. You're very kind, Cinderella. Thank you. Okay, it's almost midnight. Cinderella must go, or taxi turn into a pumpkin. -I'll see you tomorrow? -Okay. -You feel better? -Yes, much better, thank you. -Be well. -Thanks. -Bye-bye. -Bye-bye. -Who is it? -Flowers from Mr. Hannibal, Maria. How thoughtful! Thank you, Dozo. I'll get a vase. Dozo, what are you doing? Dozo, let go of my arms! Dozo, don't! Dozo, stop it! -Hello, this for you. -Thanks. Please, | see Mr. Hannibal now? Do you have an appointment? Tell him my astrologer say he change mind. He say, "Okay, Cinderella, you get out of bed... "and smile at world all day long." -Mr. Hannibal! -Well, now. This is a surprise. What happened to your astrologer? Now he say is very good day. Good day? All right. You go inside. -You hold all my calls. -Yes. Sit down. Who are these? Those are all the winners and the losers. It's the boulevard of broken dreams. Take a seat. Come on, sit down. These are for you. Agents supposed to give artist big happy dream. You give chill down spine. You're right, | don't even know why I'm telling you all about this. Let's get down to business. Now, where shall we begin? All right, this is my big surprise for you. I'm gonna handle you. We'll take care of all your needs. Carla, have lke drive Cinderella anywhere she wants to go. Cinderella so happy. Mr. Hannibal make me a star. He asked me to drive you to wherever it is you're staying. No, | thank you. Cinderella has shopping to do. Look... Mr. Hannibal asked me to drive you, | drive you. Now, you get in the car. -Good morning. -Yeah, | hope so. All right, what do we got here? She's the one? Maria from the club? Yeah. Yeah, that's her. They mutilated her breasts. Jesus, God, who'd do something like that? What have you got? | bet you miss New York, don't you? New York? Yes, someday | go. You from there? Yeah... and | miss it. You like some watermelon seed? | could take that as a racist remark, you know. -What is "racist"? -Ain't nobody ever called you a chink? Everybody call me Cinderella. Yeah, and they call me Snow White. Try, maybe you like. You just put between the teeth... and you bite into the seed like this, and you-- Will you just forget about them goddamn watermelon seeds, okay? You no want to be Cinderella's friend? Okay, you loser, not me. Would you like to make some money for a little information? Just what | want to hear, perfect. Hello, in here! Why didn't you tell me that lke drove you home? That's pressing your luck, isn't it? Letting him drive you around like that? I had no choice. He comes up to me, right to my face, and he says: "Mr. Hannibal says you get in the car, you get in the car!” And I'm up at Hannibal's room, he says... Cinderella reminds him of someone he loved dearly. He tells me to my face. But | got good news. He's going to sign Cinderella... if she lives that long. Maria is dead. She was raped... then mutilated, right after you left her last night, near as we can figure. Her body just washed ashore a few miles from here. We went over her apartment, every square inch. Not a clue. Nothing. I'll be across the hall, in my room. If you need me, just whistle. We'll talk later, okay? | want to go over there now. Where? To her place. | want to go now. What for? I need to look around. I'll grab some clothes. Jesus, her body's washed up? | told you to anchor her, didn't I? Did you go to her apartment, clean everything out? No, you didn't do that. Did you burn her clothes? No. You can't even think, you big goddamn hulk! | want you to go over her apartment now, clean it out. | mean now! Stupid idiot! Okay? Anything different? These. -Those weren't here when you parted? -Not when | was here. Good thing you came over. All right. Flowers, she had time to put in a vase. No sign of a struggle, so she knew the assailant. The flowers arrive, she lets him in, they talk because she knows him. Okay. And then.... Or the flowers arrive... delivery boy goes, assailant arrives, she lets him in because he sent flowers. Or the delivery boy is the assailant, and she lets him in to give him a tip. Or flowers have nothing to do with anything. I'm going to sit here for a while. -What's a while? -More than a minute, less than forever. You mind if | write that down? Okay, we'll sit. -I need to meditate. -You want me to leave. | need to be alone. | know you worry about me. | get away with a lot of crazy stuff. | just want to sit here for a little bit... and try to recreate what happened last night. Maybe I'll flash on something. -You got your piece with you? -Whoever was here got what they came for. All right, but I'm leaving the heavyweight downstairs. His name is Ramon. And you see me when you get back to the hotel, okay, kiddo? Name's Ramon. Yeah, yeah. Ramon, she's gonna stay up there, okay? You're gonna stay here and drive her back, okay? Taxi! Keep your eyes peeled. Keep a sharp eye, okay? When you get back, you let me know if she's there. Okay. Hold it right there. -Give me bra. -Sorry, it's not your size. Don't push your luck! Everything okay, sefiorita? Everything's fine, Ramon. You might want to call the coroner's van. | left something upstairs. Where's Dozo? It's been a couple of hours. | don't care what it's been, it's been too long. Maybe our Malaysian friends are back in town. After all, we lit up five of their delivery boys. It could be they spotted Dozo on the street and took him out. Took him out? It could be. Took him out. I'll tell you what we better do. We better up-schedule the shipment. We take the Chinese girl, Cinderella, and use her as our last shipment... and we get the money from that, and we cut out. And where the hell is Ike? 91227 Okay. Here. -And how about Checkers? -She's with me. | just came from the morgue. That man, Dozo, who attacked your partner... looked like his head got caught between two freight cars. You're on the right track. She did it? She had a crush on him. -Can | talk to her? -No, later, okay? Right now she is upstairs in her room, winding down, you know. Resting her knees. "Needs"? Sounds like a country in Africa. Yeah, | knew it. You're Checkers Goldberg! That fucking Chinese Jew. Half-Heb, half-chink. You ain't busting me again! Shit! Come on, let's check it out. Shit! All right, come on, it's five floors. Let's see what kind of shape you're in. Easy. Nothing. Not here. -Freeze! -Shit! Come on, two more floors. Listen, bitch, | played hell getting out of prison. -And | ain't going back, you hear? -Then you're going down, lover. All right, go ahead, shoot me. Checkers, where are you? Shit! Damn. You're a lousy shot, bitch. No, it's okay, she can handle this. You're supposed to shoot to kill, bitch. Damn you! Shit! -Aren't you going to do something? -Are you talking to me? -No, she's talking to me, shit for brains! -Shit! Up. Are you okay? I'm fine, ask him. She goddamn shot me. Really? | can't imagine why, scumbag. Raul, why don't you take this piss-head out of here? I'll see you again real soon, bitch! Take a number and stand in line. All right, get him out of here. -Checked all the airlines? - searched every bloody one. We better put it out on the street that there's 60,000 australes... for any information they dig up on lke or Dozo. Mr. Hannibal? -Yes? -Cinderella is here to see you. All right, okay. Go on, you beat it. Vendor very mean man. He say no, and Cinderella got into fight. He say yes, so | get good price. -Flower for you. -Thank you very much. Amparo? Yes? -Could you take care of that for me? -Yes, Mr. Hannibal. You sit down, over here. Thank you. There's a lot of people in this office... who think you can go very far. But they also think there is one thing that is stopping you. And that's.... Look, | don't know how else to say it, | mean, it's.... It's your breasts. You mean, my breasts... not big like Maria's? What do you mean, "Maria"? She one of the girls | met at the Club. She says you send her to America. Yes. She had the augmentation. We changed her... and now she's on her way to become a big star. We think you'd become a big star, too. What mean "augmentation"? Augmentation. It's a term that they use in cosmetic surgery. What they do is, they make a slit, and then they lift up the flap... and then they put in the silicones. Relatively speaking, it's absolutely painless. | like my breasts. Not too big, not too little. Just right for Cinderella. What I'm trying to say is, from a business point of view... it would be better if your breasts were big... as far as working in the United States. What I'm really advising you to do is have the implantation. I think about it. | let you know. | ask fortune teller, too. Why don't you do that? Why didn't you turn the knob? -What is the matter with you? -| know how they've been doing it. -Who? What? -Getting the China White into the States. That's no reason to come in here and go bananas! They take girls who dream about being singers and dancers... and they stuff the dope up into their breasts! What are you talking about? I'm telling you, these girls have absolutely no idea what they're doing. They think it's silicone implants. | figured each girl must be worth at least $500,000 to them. But how do they recover it? Simple enough to make them check in to a stateside doctor. He tells them they have an infection, they need a repacking. They go in, cut them up, take the heroin... and put in the silicone implants, without the girls ever knowing. You say these girls don't even know? You sure of this? Maria was in pain. It had to be the surgery. She was going to see her own doctor before she left for the States... so they killed her. That's why they cut off her breasts. Jesus Christ, this is terrible. | was so mad at that Hannibal, sitting there in his office. | wanted to kill him! Talent agent? He's a monster! A rich monster. 56 girls that we know about this year. That's $28 million. That's all it means to you men. -Tits and money! -You calm down! Don't talk to me like that! Three years, you know me better! | watch them put the stuff into condoms and swallow it, stuff it up their ass! But using women like this makes me as mad as it makes you, all right? | say we go in there and we nail them today! Yeah, without proof? -We didn't get anything from them-- -Stop that! We go in there and take Hannibal's operation apart, we'll find proof. Hannibal wants Cinderella to have the implant. That'll be our proof. What did Cinderella tell him? She'd think about it. -"I'll ask my fortune teller." -You are not going to do this. It's the perfect setup. Sit down, right there. You listen to me! They march you into surgery, they start to prep you, Hannibal takes one look... he knows you've been fooling him. He won't ask questions, you're dead. Think! Stop making sense, or | won't go. I think | can stall them till you break in to save me. You're gonna stall them? | see that. -First question, where is the hospital? -Don't know. But don't lose track of me once | go with him. Nothing can go wrong there. Forget it, it's too risky. No, risky or not, ready or not, I'll go with Hannibal first thing in the morning. -No. -First thing in the morning. I won't let you do it. | can't let you. I love you, for Christ's fucking sake! Yeah, | said it. We're partners, | can't, we'd get each other killed, but-- No, don't play it again, Sam. You listen to me. | mean, from the day | first saw you in D.C. The super brought you in and introduced you to me. | knew right then | was had. No, Waldo. Please, don't say these things. Especially not now, okay? Listen, I'm not fooling myself here. You've got some of this boy-girl shit going, too... and I'm the boy in the lash-up. Come on, admit it. Just admit it. Yeah, yeah. Not till we hang Hannibal. Hannibal, you're a dead man. Cinderella get carsick. We drive too long. We get there soon, | hope? We'll be there in about 5 or 10 minutes. He said it's five minutes from here. | mean, what's five minutes from here? There is no hospital! There's got to be something, a clinic, a country doctor... a health spa, a fat farm, something. Wait, your backup cars are getting too close. They're gonna get spotted. Tell them to.... Okay? -Gracias. Okay. -You're welcome. Is hospital? It's on the grounds. What is this place, please? It belongs to a friend of mine. Why guards have guns... like in war movie? That's my friend's way, he likes his privacy. Must be very important friend. Okay, that's it. What is this place? You know what this is? The police can't ask any questions about this place. No questions? Why? Political reasons. Political reasons? That's just great! Jerks. -What's Hannibal going in there for, then? -1 don't know. We're gonna need more backup, and fast. We need a lot of firepower. -He must be so very rich, your friend. -He is. The backup is on the way. They need 10 minutes. -They make operation here? -Yeah. You know, we have to get in there before they start to prep her. Such nice equipment. -All for Cinderella? -Nice to meet you. Hello. Listen, it's breaking up here. | can't hear. Tell the pilot to move closer to the house. Please, doctor, not too big for Cinderella. Maybe this size are just like so-- You'll be fine. Don't worry about it, he's a specialist. He'll take good care of you. Then | become big star? -If that's what you want. -Yes. Good luck. -Where you go? -Right outside. No, don't worry, it's not at all to be concerned. Now you will go with the nurse... she'll put you into the surgical gown. -Please, go with the nurse. -Come, my dear. -Doctor. -Yes? -What is inside that, Doctor? -This is the silicone for your operation. All right, the stuff's in the room. We move! -And now, you go to the nurse. -Come. All that go inside Cinderella? All right, wait a minute, let's just stop all this right here and now. Wait a minute! Hold everything! Hold it all! All right, Doctor, you do as | say. You take your nurses, get out. You, out. Come on, get out, | said! Al right. -Come on. -Is everything all right, Mr. Hannibal? Everything is fine, you just do what | tell you. Go ahead. Nothing! | got nothing! Shit! Sit down. Years ago... there was a girl. Her name was To Ha. She was Vietnamese. I loved her. The only thing was that she betrayed me. So | shot her. That's it, we go! Get the guys to hit the gate! Then, they let us know, we land right in front of the house! -Okay. -Get ready, we're going! Brody? Keep her safe. Who are these guys in the white hats? -Definitely not on our side. -No shit. | hear pop-pop sounds. We go see what's happening outside. Go sit down. Okay. Will you count in Spanish or in English? -"10" is 10 in any language. -Just count! Just count! Count! I'm gonna take it away from you! -All right, 10! -Jesus Christ! With American grenades, | always count in English. What are you doing? Why are you doing that? You're gonna do a little dance for Brody? You're picking a strange time to do this. We're not getting very far, are we? -There is our pickup. -Just in time. I'll go back over with some of these guys. Juan stays here and fires, okay? Okay! Come on. You go this time! Shit! You're dead, fucker! Gotcha! Shit! What took you? They don't call me Speedy Gonzales for nothing. Yeah, well.... Shit! Come on. If Check is there, make a sound! Check, you there? Grenade. This is American? Throw the goddamn thing! We're gonna talk. Where's Hannibal? Don't know. The office is over there. They're probably getting the fuck out of here. You did very well. Good. Shit. Hi. You okay? Yeah. What? He said what? I'm telling you, he said he'd build me a palace. Yeah, well, the guy was obviously crazy. Yeah. He had to be crazy to love me. He was crazy to think he could take over part of the Golden Triangle. He was maybe crazy to love you, too. I don't know. We'll take off. I'm gonna leave it to you, okay? Okay, we have dinner, no? Yeah, before we go. We're gonna have your favorite. "Lobster"! For me? Lobster! Bye, Waldo. All right, tell me, do you want a ride or you want to fly? Who wants to ride when she can fly? Come on. Listen, in my back pocket there's a telex. Why don't you dig it out? It's for you. A little deeper, farther to the left. Waldo. It came in just before we took off. What? | don't believe this! Did you see this? | took a peek, yeah. What kind of thanks is this for all the work we've done? All those long nights, no social life, cold pizza till 3:00 a.m., crummy motels. | mean, why are they breaking us up? Come on! That's a hell of a step up the ladder, Check. | mean, they're putting you in charge of the whole western division. That's a lot more responsibility than tagging along with a guy like me. Anyway, how do you figure Washington? No point trying. You're behind this. What? You made them promote me. | can't make them do anything! | told them what a great partner you were. Have you forgotten what you said? -What did | say? -You said you love me! | did say that. Do you still? More than yesterday. What? Say again. | said, | love you more than | did yesterday. What took you so long? | expected you to fall for me. Didn't you? Yeah, yeah.
