We're getting into San Francisco in 5 minutes. Asta! My best Sunday-go-to-meeting hat! Dear, dear. Darling, don't you want to pack this? How they can expect a woman to still have any mystery left for a man after living in a place like this for 3 days, I don't know. Darling, you don't need mystery. You've got something much better, something more alluring. What? Me. You! Ha ha! It's all right. We're married. Darling, you've got to pack. That's right. Right, I must pack, right. Are you packing, dear? Mm-hmm. Yes, darling, I'm just putting away this liquor. Ooh! If you break that, they could sue you. Oh, baby, you know, I'm going to miss this little room of ours. It's left some lasting impressions on me. Dear, will you pack this? Yes. Delighted, delighted. You know, I sort of hate to leave this. Oh, don't leave anything. Well, are you, uh... You going to wear this dress, dear? No. You can put that in. Oh, that's fine. That's fine. Nick Charles in this car? Two cars back. Two cars back. Hello, Nick! Well, how are you? Are you going to play detective again? That's what we want to know. I'm through detecting for the rest of my natural life. Are you going to keep on with your detective work, Nick? I've retired. I'm just going to take care of my wife's money so I'll have something in my old age. You said you'd retire in New York, but I noticed you took that thin man case. That thin man was a beaut. They're still talking about it. Dig us up another thin man, will you, Nick? That was a great case, Nick. You'd take a case like that, wouldn't you, Nick? I only took that to please my wife. She wants some excitement. I guess she had it! Oh, it was wonderful. Two men tried to kill him. But he's not going to take any more cases. You can print that. That's my darling. Hello, Harold. Hiya, Harold. I'm glad to see you. So long, Nick! See you around! Excuse me, lady. Hello, fingers. Well, Nick, how are you? How's business? Oh, I quit that racket. Nick, Nick, look. My purse is gone. Oh, darling, isn't that too bad? Nora, I want you to know fingers. This is my wife. Your wife! Mm-hmm. Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Gee, I... gee, I didn't know you were married. Oh, yes, I'm married. Nick, what will I do? I know I had it. Don't worry, darling. It will turn up. Won't it, fingers? I certainly hope so. Well, Nick, am I tickled to death to see you. Good old Nick. And married, too! I didn't know you were married. Oh, yes, yes. Well, I'm glad I bumped into you. Well, good-bye, Mrs. Charles. Good-bye. Good-bye, fingers. Come on, dear. I just can't go off... come on, we don't want to embarrass him. What are you talking about? He's a purse snatcher. Think of his feelings. Well, then, he must have taken it. So long, fingers! So long, Nick! There you are, dear. Dear, you do know the nicest people. Hello, Nick! Hello, bill! Hey, you can start delivering again! And all the big kegs! Hello, Nick! How are you, boys? Where have you been, Nick? Have I been away all my life? Have you seen the kid? No. Where is he? He's staging a comeback Friday night. Hey, screwy, here's Nick Charles! Hello, Mr. Charles! Hello, Nick! How are you, kid? How's it going? Never better! Never better! Say, now I know I can't lose! You coming to see me fight? Mrs. Charles would never think of missing one of your fights. Mrs. Charles! Well, well, did you ever see me fight? You got a treat, then! I'm going to cut the guy up in ribbons, if I don't have him bleeding in the first round. You'll have him bleeding? Yeah. Excuse me, Mrs. Charles. If my legs will only hold out, I'll kill the guy. I'm going to knock... that-a boy, bump. You'll get him sure. Give it to him hot! Sure! Ok, Harold! Oh, hello, Nora! Oh, hello. Who's that? Oh, you wouldn't know them, darling. They're respectable. Oh... ♪ Home, home on the range ♪ Isn't it lovely? Home. So peaceful. So quiet. If anybody wakes me up for a week, I'm going to have the law on them. Oh, new year's Eve at home. Or would you know that this is new year's? I know. Oh. I suppose you got ideas, huh? Very definite ideas. I was afraid so. I'm going to lock the door, plug the bell, cut the telephone, and crawl into bed for a month. Oh, Nora, you're my favorite woman. Here, I'm going to be in bed at midnight, so happy new year. Happy new year. Come in, come in. Give me your hat and coat. Make yourself at home. It's our house all right. Let's go in. The man said it was all right. Yeah. Hey, the bar's right in here. Help yourself. Thanks. Ok. What's the celebration? We're giving a surprise party for Nick and Nora. Oh, Nick and Nora. Don't you know Nick and Nora? No. Neither do I. That's not going to spoil my fun. It's new year's. What's the odds? Go on in, fake it. It's a cinch. Well, thanks. Go on in and get some of that Napoleon Brandy before it's all gone. Now, listen, let's get together on this. This is supposed to be a surprise party. I'm acting surprised. Not bad, huh? Oh, no, not at all. How you doing? Anyone wise to you here? No. What did I tell you? May I have this dance? If I was in a fire on the third floor, would you save me? It's too late for you to be saved, baby. No, I mean it. How would you do it? Well, I'd just pick you up and put you right down there. Now you save me! You put her down and you save me. I'm on the third floor, too! Hey, I'll bet you can't do this! Watch me. Here I go. When I picked this big lug up, he didn't know a thing. I taught him everything he knows. Show 'em that new arm lock I taught you. Ok! Now show 'em that headlock! This will kill you. Show 'em how you throw them out in the aisles. ♪ Sing, sing, sing, sing ♪ ♪ Everybody start to sing ♪ ♪ Ia la ♪ ♪ Nyah nyah ♪ ♪ Now you're singing with a swing ♪ "Hello, Nick. Hello, Nora. "Welcome home. We are tendering this little surprise party for the..." You can't go through the kitchen! We're busy! Hey, where will I put this ice? Lay it down and don't bother! Put it in the sink and break it up. Where's the oil? There isn't any more! Where do you want these? Over here! Right down there! Come back from the store with some olive oil! Oh, my toast! I'll take care of that. Leave that alone! Oh, Mr. Charles! Hello there, Mr. Charles. I'm glad to see you. How are you, Mr. Charles? How are you, Nick? Oh, you're looking great! We saw your pictures in the paper! They said you did a good job in New York. I guess they'll be scared to death if there are any more murders back there. I've been scared to go down in the cellar ever since! Don't you worry, rose. If anyone murders you, I'll catch them. Oh, Mr. Charles, don't be talking that way. What do you think of the party they're giving you? Looks like we're giving it. It does that, now. That's probably your aunt Katherine, Mrs. Charles. She's phoned several times. She wants you to come for dinner. Good-bye, Mrs. Charles, I'll see you next year. She expects you, too, Mr. Charles. Me? There must be some mistake. She wouldn't want you. No. What excuse will I make? Tell her that I lost a collar button in New York and we've got to go look for it. It's your cousin Mrs. Landis, madame. Oh, thank heavens it isn't aunt Katherine. Get out of it, now. Don't worry. I wouldn't go through that again if you had twice as much money. Hello, Selma. Nora, I just wanted to make sure you were coming tonight. But you've just got to come. I'm in terrible trouble. Please! No, I can't tell you now, but you must come. I'm desperate! Selma! Whom are you calling? Nora. Oh, I told you! I can't help it, I... there are some pills in my bag. Take them. Oh, no, aunt Katherine, really... Take them or I'll call Dr. Kammer! How are you, Nora? This is aunt Katherine. Oh, you ought to know Selma well enough not to pay any attention to that. Well, you see, it's new year's Eve, aunt Katherine. The old battle-ax. Shut up! Excuse me, aunt Katherine, I was talking to the dog. But, aunt Katherine... give me that. Give it to me. Yes. All right, we'll come. Oh, Nicky, I'm sorry, but I had to do it. Selma's in trouble. You like Selma, don't you? Well, not that much. Family dinner, I suppose. Aunt Katherine... Uncle Willie, cousin Emily. Aunt Hattie, cousin Lucius... Uncle Thomas. Pour me one, too. Thanks. Hello, Asta. Why are you looking so down in the mouth? You got family troubles, too? For heaven's sake, do you want the servants to hear you? I don't care. I'm going crazy. I can't stand it any longer. I'm going to call the police! You'll do nothing of the sort! Haven't we paid out enough to hush up his other scandals? He never did anything like this before. How do we know... I told you I'd handle this. I can't go on! Quiet! Beg pardon, madame, but shall I remove Mr. Robert's place? Certainly not! Mr. Robert will be here. Very well. You know he won't be here. I know nothing of the sort! Now go upstairs and make yourself presentable. Go on! Hurry! Hurry now because everybody's waiting. Good evening, all. Good evening, aunt Katherine. I had a birthday last week, Katherine. I'm 83 years old! 83 years old! What do you think of that? That's fine, Lucy. Next year I'll be 84. Splendid. Now we're alone, I have something important to tell all of you. What did she say? Shh! Is that thing working, Hattie? This works beautifully! It's you... you mumble. What is it, Katherine? Nora and her husband are coming tonight. Katherine, after the last time? But, Katherine! Her husband? That person? But you said yourself you wouldn't have him again. I know I did, and my opinion of him and what he represents hasn't changed a particle. Then I can't understand why you asked him. I have a very good reason for asking him, which you'll know in time. That must be they now. Understand now I want you all to be pleasant to him. Of course if you say so... it's going to be very difficult. Poor Nora. My heart bleeds for that child. If that's Mr. and Mrs. Charles, show them right in. Yes, madame. What are you muttering to yourself? I'm trying to get all the bad words out of my system. Good evening, Henry. Is this the wax works? Sir? Nothing, Henry, nothing. I'll leave my things down here. Don't worry. It isn't catching. Thank you. Walk this way, sir. Well, I'll try. Nicky, pull yourself together. One squint at aunt Katherine would sober anybody up. Mr. and Mrs. Charles, madame. How do you do, my dear? Hello, aunt Katherine. You remember Nick. How are you, Nicholas? Hello, cousin Helen. How are you, you poor child? This is Nora's husband. I think you know everybody. Oh, yes, yes, I seem to remember the old faces. Oh, dear, I want you to meet uncle Willie. Poor Nora is so brave. Uncle Willie, my husband. Uncle. And, dear, this is aunt Hattie. How are you? Don't mumble, young man. Don't mumble. How are you? She's deaf. You're telling me. What did she say? When you hear the chime, it will be exactly... Oh, Selma! Oh, Nora! Selma, how are you? So good to see you. Hello, Nick. Thank heavens you came. Selma, what's the trouble? Tell me. Well, we'll postpone any discussion till after dinner. Where's your husband? Yes, where's Robert? Robert telephoned that he was unavoidably detained. So we'll start without him. Are you ready? We haven't quite men enough to go around, so, Lucius, will you take Hattie and Charlotte? Willie, will you take Helen and Emily? Burton, will you take Nora? Ahem! Ahem! Nicholas! You will take aunt Lucy. Come on, Selma. What was it you were going to tell me? Nora, come here! Just a minute, aunt Katherine. What was it? Robert has disappeared. Disappeared! Selma! Go on playing. I can't go on playing. Nonsense! Go on! I can't! I can't! What are you trying to do? Torture me? Selma! Nora! How can you act like this when you know what she's going through? Get Nicholas. You bet I will. No! Really? Well, you amaze me! Would you explain that point a bit further? Uh, well, I wouldn't go as far as to say that. What's that? Oh, uh, just a moment. Really? Well, surely you're not going to let that pass unchallenged, are you? You must have something to say to that. That's the boy. I knew you had it in you. Nick. Hmm? Come here. Oh, yes. If you gentlemen will excuse me. I don't know when I've spent such a stimulating evening. What is it? Aunt Katherine wants to speak to you. What have I done now? Do you know why Robert wasn't here tonight? Sure. Because he's smart. I'm not fooling, darling. He's disappeared. That's swell. Now if we could just get aunt Katherine to disappear. We're here. Oh, Nicholas, I'm sorry to take you away from the boys. Oh, that's quite all right. Well, how long has Robert been gone? 3 days. 3 days without a word. Did you notify the police? Certainly not! And we're not going to. Oh, no! Robert may have been kidnapped. He may be lying dead somewhere. But we mustn't do anything about it. Our precious name might get into the papers! Oh, don't pay any attention to her. She's exaggerating the whole affair. However, to please her, I thought you might investigate the matter quietly. With your experience as a... Flatfoot. Well, I didn't mean to be as blunt as that. What's the difference? It's all in the family. Have you any idea where he might be? Yes. He's with some woman. I know that. Selma, you know nothing of the sort. What about the vanity case they sent me from that Chinese restaurant? That was a stupid mistake on their part. Mistake! He's with some woman. You know it. Selma, you know Robert worships you! He wouldn't... how can you say such a thing when you know that he hates me?! He only married me for my money! He never did love me! Sometimes I wish he were dead! Well, I'm just a little confused. Do you want him back or don't you? Nick! Well, of course, she wants him back! Selma, don't! Please, don't! No. I leave this in your hands, Nicholas. If you excuse me, I'll go back to my guests. Don't worry, darling. It will be all right. Nick will find him. The one sure way to get him back is to cut off his money. I know. Well, if he doesn't show up before tomorrow morning, I'll go down to the police and see what I can do. Thank you, Nick. Mr. Graham calling, madame. Ah, David. Hello, Nick. Happy new year. David, how are you? Nora, it's nice to see you. Well, thank heaven you two are back. Selma, how are you, dear? Any word yet? I'll tell you what. What? Let's take David and sneak out. We'll go somewhere and celebrate the new year. That's a good idea. How about it, Selma? Come on, darling. It will be like old times when we were all engaged. Yes, before we made any mistakes. What do you mean mistakes? Oh, I was thinking of Selma. Come on, Selma. Thanks. I want to stay near a telephone. You know, just in case. But you go, David. No, not on your life. I'll stay here with you. Well, then, good night, dear. Try to have a happy new year. Happy new year. Very happy new year, Selma. Good night, David. Good night. We'll say good-bye to the family. It will be a pleasure. Look what I found. Iced and everything. Don't you stay here, David. You go out and have some fun. Don't be silly. We can have fun right here. What's the matter with me anyway? Why haven't I any pride? What can't I face it? Robert doesn't give a hang about me. You can't indefinitely go on caring for somebody who doesn't care for you, can you? Well, it's been done. Oh, David, I'm so sorry. I've been such a fool. You really ought to hate me for what I've done to you. No, now, don't talk like that. You get the glasses, and I'll try to open this thing. No! We're going out. This is a new year, the time for resolutions. I'm through with Robert. I mean it. I'm going to get my things. We're going to celebrate. We'll start the new year right. What is it, Henry? The telephone... has it... no, madame. It's Mrs. Forrest. She would like you to join her in the drawing room. All right, Henry. Guess it's no use. Please go, David. Oh, now, Selma. I'd rather you did, really. I'll go to bed. Dr. Kammer's given me something to make me sleep. All right, I'll go. Good night, Henry. Good night. Good night. Darling, you will try to find Robert, won't you? I didn't lose him. It will get you in right with aunt Katherine. That's what I'm afraid of. Oh, David, what happened? Selma sent me away. She wanted to be alone. I could murder that Robert. Well, wait till I tell you about the newest thing he pulled on me. Called me up several days ago and told me if I gave him $25,000, he'd clear out and leave Selma for me. Lovely boy. What did you say? Well, I didn't know exactly what to say. I asked him to give me several days to think it over. Well, 25,000 is cheap if he'll really go. Why don't you get up a collection? I know a lot of people who will be glad to contribute. Poor girl. Bad enough with aunt Katherine and Robert. Now she's got that Dr. Kammer. Who's Dr. Kammer? Oh, I don't know. He's some nut psychologist. Sits around and talks about her dreams by the hour. I get the creeps every time I look at him. Harold, we want to go someplace and get the taste of respectability out of our mouths. Ok, Nick. Well, I don't think I can go. Oh, David, why not? Got too much on my mind, I guess. I'm glad you're back, anyway. Happy new year. Happy new year, David. Selma was a fool not to have married him instead of Robert. They can't all be as lucky as you are, darling. What have you got to offer, Harold? There's Tim McCrumb's place, and there's the Lai Chi, and there's the tin Dipper. Is the Lai Chi a Chinese restaurant? Yes mam.. Me no looky for Robert. The Lai Chi.

I got a message for you. What is it? Your brother's looking for you. Well, let him look. So that's the way it is, huh? Now, Phil, don't try to start anything. I'm in a hurry. You've been in a hurry ever since I got back. Can I help it if I got to work? That ain't what I'm kicking about. What's going on with this drunk? Nothing. Oh, no? What's this? Give me that!

I can't cut you in. It's yours, ain't it? Yeah, but... but what?! Listen, Phil, don't spoil my makeup! I got another number to do! So that's the way it is, huh? You big lug! Now, how am I going to explain that? There are a lot of things you'll have to explain before I'm through with you. Phil! Phil! Excuse me. What are you doing? Shaking her down again? What's that to you? Why don't you lay off her for a while? She's busy. I know. What do you know? A few things that are going on around here. Smart boy, huh? You know things. When are you going to start shaking me down? When I want to shake you down, I'll... I put up with you because you're Polly's brother, but don't think you can ride too far on that ticket. Now, stay away for a couple of days. My, what big confetti they throw here. Get out of the way, you big clown! Ha ha! Well, that's more like it. Too bad we didn't bring aunt Katherine. Oh, Mr. Charles! How are you? Hello, dancer. Neat way you have of tossing your customers out. His sister works here. I just get tired of him sometimes. I felt a gun under his left arm. Just breaking it in for a friend. I want you to meet my partner. This is Lum Kee. Mr. Charles. And Mrs. Charles. I'm your friend, you bet you. You sent his brother up, remember? Lum Yunk. Oh, yes, yes. He was the one who spread out some tongue differences to include a bank stickup. You bet you. You catch my brother. You play trick on him. No play trick on him, no catch him. You bet you. Is he still in? You bet you... for 5 year more. Excuse, please. Is he a gunman, too? No, but you never can tell how close brothers are. Thought you might like to know. Thanks. He's a great guy to have liking you. This way, Mrs. Charles. Help Mr. Charles. Many customers tonight? Oh, yes. We always do a pretty good business, you know. Mm-hmm. Follow me. Nicky, there's Robert. Yes, I know. Why didn't you tell me? Robert! Why, Robert, where have you been? Well, fancy meeting you here. Why haven't you sent any word to Selma? She's almost crazy with worry. She ought to know better by now. Well, Nicholas! Oh! How's it coming? Fine, up till now. Sorry I can't ask you to sit down. Oh, that's all right. I'll ask her. Nora, won't you sit down? So... She sent the great big detective to find me. I have a table for you across the room, Mr. Charles. I think you'll be more comfortable there. Oh, I'm sure they would. I'll be over in just a minute. Thanks. Why don't you call Selma and tell her you're all right? Well, don't exaggerate. Just call her. Well, you can tell her... When you go back to report on me. Tell her I'm having a swell time, and I'm not going back unless I have to. And I don't think I'll have to. I'll be delighted to tell her that. Well, you'll forgive us if we tear ourselves away. Uh, dancer seems a bit anxious. Hello, handsome! Is he a friend of yours? On the contrary. A relation. Hmm. He's been hanging around here for 3 days, drunk. Got a case on our prima Donna. I wish you'd toss him out. His wife's going crazy. That's too bad. I'll speak to his girlfriend. Well, I've done my duty. I wonder what's up. Up where? Up there. Where? There. And it comes out here. Ah, scotch... Probably. Some of his relatives just flew in. What'll we do? Give the customers one more song and knock off for the night. Take him up to your place and keep him. Ok. Nicky, what time is it? It's 25 till 12:00, and our first new year's alone. Hello, Nick! Maybe I was wrong. Hello, Joe! Hello. Excuse me, lady. Say, Nick, Willie the weeper's outside, see? Oh. When did he get out? He got out this morning, see, and he's on parole, see? According to rules and regulations, he ought to be mingling with some respectable people, see? I thought you had a nice table here, see? Maybe, uh... Oh, by all means. Oh, that's fine. You're a gent. Hey, boys! Everything all right, Mr. Charles? Everything's all something. You needn't worry about Mr. landis. Polly's going to see he gets home all right. Waiter! No check for this table. Anything they want is on the house. Oh, I can't let you do that, see? Ah, but I insist. You're my guests. Come on, boys! This'll mean a lot to Willie, see? New year's Eve and everything, see? All right, dancer, if you insist. It's mighty wight of you. Meet the rest of my party. Hi. Gentlemen, be seated. This is Willie. You remember Willie. Well, how are you? Glad to see you, Willie. Likewise. I am honored to be at your coming-out party. Nora, this is Willie the weeper. Delighted. Likewise. And the boys. Hi. How do you do? Do you boys know dancer? I don't want to know him. Aw, he's a crumb. Don't say that, boys. He's giving the party. Everything's on the house. Yeah? That right? Well, that's different. Why didn't you say so? Drinks and everything? Sure. Champagne, boys. Me, too! Sure, champagne. Willie? Scotch... With a champagne chaser. Likewise. What do you say? Wouldn't take much to make me leave this town for good. We could have a lot of fun on 25,000. What's the use talking about that? You haven't got it yet. Don't worry, I'll get it. When did he say he'd let you know? Tomorrow. There's my number. I got to go on. Listen, go and call him now. Don't let anybody hear you. If he says he'll give it to you tonight, I'll go with you right away. We got time for one more song, folks, before the new year. Miss Polly Byrnes will sing a new number for you... smoke dreams.

I'll go on home. Selma will be tickled to death to see me. Hmm? I'm at the Lai Chi club. All right, I'll meet you there in a couple of minutes. Don't keep me waiting, though.

Do you think she'll really take him home? She'll take him somewhere, I'm sure of that. What do you mean? I mean, did I ever tell you that you're the most fascinating woman this side of the Rockies? Wait till you've seen me on the other side. And I said to him, "you ain't gonna give me a ticket, you big flatfoot, and you know it," I said. "I got a right to turn there, and you know it," I said. I said, "I ain't got all night "to be sitting here gassing, so go Polish your buttons and leave me be on my way, you fat palooka," I said. I know, and then you busted our crime. All right. Thank you, sir Galahad. You'll keep your promise? You don't mind if I go home for 10 minutes? What for? Don't worry. I won't see your precious Selma. I just want to get some clothes. 10 minutes shouldn't matter to a man who's waited as long as you have. Well, ta-ta. I'm worried. I'm worried! I'm going to phone and see if Robert got home! I don't care whose wife she is. I don't like a dame that gets noisy after she's had a few snifters. Don't you think I'd better? All right, but hurry. It's almost 12:00. I'll be right back. Here. Get on that phone and stay on it. Hurry. Well, that settles that. Never mind. They don't answer. I told her to take him straight to her place. Mr. landis? Yeah. I wanted her to get him in shape so he could go home. Mr. landis on phone. I hear him say he go home. Oh, he did, huh? Good. He's a relative of Mr. Charles. Felt sort of responsible. Oh, well... I think I'll go out and get some fresh air in one of my lungs. Be back in a minute. Robert! Hello, Selma. How are you? Where have you been? Oh, why do you do these things? I've been going crazy. There, there, darling. No, no. I won't this time. I won't forgive you. You're not going to make a fool of me again. All right, darling. I only came for a moment to get some clothes. Where are you going? A little trip. No, you're not! I won't have it! I won't! Ohh... Unh... Want to kiss me good-bye, darling? Thank you. Selma, Selma, what's happened? He was going away, and I tried to stop him. Now, Selma, listen to me. Now, listen! I want you to go back to the house. You've never had a pistol, you understand? Hear me? You've never been out of the house tonight. You don't know anything about this. Understand? Now, come on. Hurry. Happy new year! Happy new year, everybody! Happy new year, darling... uh... Oh. Excuse me. Ha ha! I guess there must be some mistake. Oh, no! Why, yes. In the dark... And my wife said that she'd be right back... Oh, yeah?! Uh... Hmm? Excuse me. Happy new year. Happy new year to you, too. Nora! Darling! Sugar! Happy new year! Nicky, you're bleeding! Hmm? Yes, dear. Oh, yes, yes. A little accident. I know. This new year's traffic is terrible, isn't it? Yes. You made any new year's resolutions? Not yet. Any complaints or suggestions? Uh-huh. A few. Which? Complaints. All right. Shoot. Well, you don't scold, you don't nag... And you look far too pretty in the mornings. All right, I'll remember. Must scold, must nag, mustn't be too pretty in the mornings. Happy new year, baby! Say, what are you doing here, anyway? Still trying to call Selma. Well, what... oh. Well, come on. I'll find you a phone. Hello, dancer. Come in, come in. Once a gumheel, always a gumheel, huh? And I don't like gumheels. But I thought you'd quit it when you married a pot of money. Did he call me a pot? You know, I don't like to be critical, dancer, but, uh... You know, it doesn't look quite right when you and your partner and your prima Donna and your best customer all go out at the same time. Gives the place a sort of vacant look. Have you ever been thrown out of a place, Mr. Charles? Let's see. How many was it up to yesterday, Mrs. Charles? Well, how many places have you been in, Mr. Charles? Hello. Aunt Katherine? This is Nick. I mean, Nicholas. What? Oh. Yes, I will. Well, now, if you're through in here... Ahh... Polly. Another of our travelers has returned. I've only... Ah... No sooner said than done. Quite a gathering of the clans. I wonder which one of you would be more surprised if Robert landis were to walk in here right now. Of course, you know that that couldn't happen, don't you, dancer? I don't know what you're talking about, and I don't care. Now get out of here. What is it, Nick? Robert's been killed. Killed?! Get out of here! Oh, no. On the contrary, we're going to have a lot more people in. Give me that phone. Certainly. See? You better go to Selma, Nora. She may need you. Hello? This is Nick Charles speaking. I want to get hold of lieutenant Abrams of the homicide squad. Why are you calling him? It's a cinch none of us shot landis. Maybe he'll explain how you knew he was shot. Hey! What are you doing there? How did Mrs. landis and her husband get on together? Any fights? Any arguments? No, sir. Mr. Abraham! How dare you question my servants? Lady, a man's been killed. I got to find out who did it. Surely, you don't think... how do I know what to think if nobody'll tell me anything? Did you hear anyone leave the house after Mr. landis left? Certainly not! Will you please let him talk? Mr. Abraham... my name is lieutenant Abrams! Well? No, sir. All right, I'll see you all later. Obviously, just a holdup. A holdup? With that bracelet and those bonds left on him? Henry, will you show lieutenant Abrahamson out? Lady, I'm not going till I see Mrs. landis. Now, look, I can't help it if you don't like me. I'm just doing my duty. I tell you, Mrs. landis cannot see anyone! She's under the care of a doctor. What's her doctor's name? Dr. Kammer. Dr. Adolph Kammer? Yes. Oh... So that's the way it is. Precisely. Sorry to inconvenience you, lieutenant Abrams. Ok, doc. Then you're willing to take the responsibility of not letting me talk to her? My dear sir, it's not a question of responsibility. Mrs. landis has had a very great shock. It was necessary to give her something to quiet her nerves. Could she talk to you in her sleep? When'll she be awake? Not for some hours. Do you often have to give Mrs. landis things to quiet her? Ok, doc, check that off. Then, is she crazy? You're insulting! Lady, I've seen this guy 3 times in my life, and all 3 times, he was on a witness stand testifying that someone was nuts. First it was that Mrs. Gerris. Then the Darryl woman. By golly, she shot her husband, too. Too?! What right have you to say a thing like that? In view of that very definite accusation, I think, miss Forrest, that you should insist that your attorney is present at any future interviews with the police. Anybody's tongue is liable to slip. Lieutenant Abrams! Hurry. Nick's waiting for you down at the Lai Chi club. He's got them all down there. What happened? I don't know. He knows. He'll tell you everything. I hope somebody can tell me something. Where's Selma? She's sleeping. She's not to be disturbed. I won't disturb her, but I'm going to be there when she wakes up. Well? I don't think that, as yet, there is any reason for alarm. Selma. Selma. They're... they're going to arrest me. They're going to arrest me, aren't they? No, no. Of course they're not, dear. They all believe I did it... aunt Katherine, the doctor, all of them. No, no, Selma. They don't think that at all. I heard them. I know. Now, darling... But I didn't kill him! I didn't... I didn't... I'm... I'm sure I didn't. You'll help me, won't you, Nora? Why... why, of course, darling, but you'd better lie down now and get some rest. They... they gave me some pills, but I didn't take them. You should have, dear. You need to sleep. No, no. No, I can't. I can't. I've got to think. D-David... David! What about David? He thinks so, too. He... he... he must think so, or he wouldn't have... he wouldn't have what? Nothing. Nothing. Oh... You tell him I didn't. Tell him I didn't do it. Darling, couldn't you telephone? No. No, someone might be listening. You go to him. Tell him I didn't do it. Hurry! All right, Selma, I will. This is your news reporter speaking. The old year was hardly out when death struck savagely in the slaying of Robert landis, wealthy young society playboy. Mystery surrounds the shooting... It's I... Nora! Well, hello, Nora. This is a surprise. Nick with you? What's the matter? Just let me sit down. Don't you know what's happened? No. What? Oh... Well, first, Robert was killed. He was killed?! Yes. We saw him at the... David, look! That's the brother of the girl that was with Robert! Don't let him get away. He might know something. I'll get him as he comes out the alley. Not so fast, buddy. Mr. law speaking. Get inside there. Who you got in there with you? Hey, you! Just a minute. Get out of that window. What are you trying to do? Make a getaway? I'm not trying to make a getaway. There was someone on the fire escape. Where is he? He's gone now. All right, then. Let's get going. Officer, this lady is... I know all about this lady. I been trailing her ever since she left the Forrest house. Come on, let's get together here. Where are we going? We're going to headquarters. There must be some mistake. I'm Mrs. Nick Charles. Yeah, and I'm mother goose. Step on it, girlie. Let's go. I've been trying to tell you for the last half-hour, none of us had anything to do with... shut up, dancer. If I want more of your charm, I'll ask for it. Let her talk. Now go on. I took him home, like dancer told you. Did you hear a shot? I heard something... like backfire from an automobile. It was foggy, and... well, I was too far away to see anything. I thought I'd better get out of the neighborhood if I didn't want to get into trouble. Aw, phooey! Why don't you ask her what she was too far away from? From wherever it was it happened. If I hadn't been too far away, I would've known what it was, would I? Well, I... I give up. All right, dancer, where were you? I went out to get some air. What city ordinance does that break? I went with him. Where did you go for all this air? Air pretty much same everywhere. We go in my car, ride around. Ask chauffeur. Riding around, eh? New year's Eve, the place is jammed, and you two are riding around. Phooey! You listen to me! You don't know who I am! I came here to see a client! This is very important business! No, you listen to me! You can't do this to me! Hey, hey, lay him down. Hello, Casper. He's our lawyer. I knew there'd be some shyster around. Well, well, what is this? Do I know? So a guy comes in and buys a drink. He goes out, and somebody kills him. What are we supposed to do? Give the customers insurance with the drinks? Not a bad idea. I didn't recognize you, Mr. Charles! Remember me? Floyd Casper! Oh, yes, yes. How are you? Always kidding. Why, Abrams... You don't think that these people would have anything to do with a thing like that! Why, I've known this lad since... save that for the D.A. You got a gun? Sure... And a permit. You? You! If you want to take those, we'd like a receipt. Tell your shyster of yours to shut up, or I'll drag you down to the hall of justice. On what charges? Witnesses. To ask them questions. You ought to know. Your clients spend 9/10 of their time doing it. Take these down and check them with the bullet that killed landis. Hold it a minute. You. You got a gun? No. What did you do with it? I never had one. Nobody has anything, nobody knows anything. All right, go ahead. Miss Byrnes has a brother who has a gun. And my chauffeur tells me that he hung around outside until just about the time she and landis left. If he was there, he was just hanging around waiting for me. He wouldn't kill Robert, Mr. Charles. He wouldn't have no reason! I'm not accusing anyone. I'm just talking. But I think you ought to find him. At least he might give his version as to why dancer threw him out. If that little rat tries to hang anything on me, I'll... you leave my brother out of this! Take it easy, take it easy! That's what they want. They want to get you at each other's throats. Just answer what you want to and don't let 'em get you. I can't stand that shyster! I was beginning to suspect that. You call me, Nick? No, not yet, Harold, but you ought to stick around. Outside. It's, uh... Very close in here. Where is this brother of yours that didn't kill anyone? He lives in a hotel on Turk street. I don't know just where. You don't know much of anything, do you? I honestly don't know which hotel! Phil's always moving. What's the matter? Does he have to move every time he don't kill someone? Don't be so funny. You got me in stitches. Stay where you are, everybody! Get that switch! I'll get them, Nick! Hello? Hello... oh. Hello? What? I can't hear you... so much noise going on around here. What? Oh, headquarters? Well, yeah, this is Nick Charles speaking. Hey, hey, take it easy, will you, fellas? I can't hear a thing. Look, dancer just got away. Yeah, have the boys pick him up, will you? It's all right, Nick, I got him. Wait a minute. My chauffeur thinks he's got him. I've got him! No! No, it's Abrams he's got. Harold, you better let him up. He may not like that. Say! What's the idea? Take it easy, lady. Let go of me, will you? What do you think you're doing? The lights went out. Do you want me to stand out there while Nick might be in trouble? What was the shooting? I guess it was me. Did you get him? I thought it was him coming through the door, but I guess it was only me in that mirror. And I want... and I want... I want to have a description of that brother of yours. What are you picking on Phil for? What about Mrs. landis killing him? Maybe she found out we was going away together. Maybe she found out about that Graham giving him the bonds. Don't talk till you get legal advice! You're their lawyer, not mine! How do I know you won't leave me holding the bag? Now we're getting somewhere. Pick up Mrs. landis, doctor or no doctor. Come on, all of you. We're going down to headquarters. You can't do that! Huh? Uh... All it sounds like to me is that they picked up my wife in a man's apartment. Say it again. That's it. That's what she says. I've never seen your wife myself. Let me talk to him. Graham. David Graham. Hold him? Ok. Why this is all crazy. That can't be Nick. It's him, all right. Tell him it's Nora. She says to say it's Nora, Mr. Charles. Nora? Nah... Sounds like a phony to me. Better throw her in the fish tank till I get down there. Right. Well? Throw her in the fish tank. What? Why... throw her in the fish tank. Why, of all the... Will you open this door or will I kick it in? What did I tell you about horning in on somebody else's game? All right, matron. How you do? I'd like to get this gal out of the women's tank. Oh, yes. Is this the one that was doing the fan dance? Fan dance? Yes. Well, if it is, she's been holding out on me. Hi there. Say, are you a lawyer? Hey! Did Mr. Fineburg send you? Who you looking for? Will I do? Bail us out of here! Do you see her? No, I guess she isn't here. Nicky, here I am! Excuse me! Wait a minute. Huh? Excuse me. Here I am. Uh, well... This is a fine way to start the new year. Nicky, get me out of here. How long has this thing with David been going on? Oh, stop that. Get me out of here. I've got something to tell you. About the case? Yes. I'll get you out on one condition. No more detecting, no more cases. Promise? But this is important. Never mind. Nick! Well? I promise. All right. Let her out. Come on. Are you Mrs. Charles? Yes. Lieutenant Abrams wants you for questioning. Questioning? Don't worry, darling. I'll write you every day. Were you and landis on good terms? Decidedly not. On bad terms? Very bad. You and Mrs. landis were once engaged. That's right. Until landis came along? Yes, sir. Ever ask her to divorce him and marry you? I may have. She never said she would. But you hoped she would. And you thought with him out of the way, she might. Now, look, I didn't kill Robert. Did I say you did? But you did pay him to go away. Yes. Yes, I did. Let them in. Will you please sit down, Mrs. Charles? I, uh, I have to ask your wife a couple of questions, Mr. Charles. I'm sorry. Oh, that's quite all right. Now, Mrs. Charles, why did you go to Mr. Graham's apartment? Why... Why... Well, perhaps I better leave. Why, Selma had a silly idea that David thought she killed Robert, and she wanted me to go and tell him that she didn't. Oh, now, wait a minute. I can't imagine her thinking a thing like that. That's ridiculous. I haven't seen her for two days. Will you come in, Mrs. landis? Selma... Nora. Dear, sit down. Oh! David, I didn't want you dragged into this. Mrs. landis, why did Mr. Graham think you killed... now, I never said that, and I never thought it for a minute! It's all right, David. He had every right to think I did it. He's just trying to protect me. He heard a shot... He came running up to me... Just a minute. What were you doing there? I wanted to make sure that he kept his promise to go away. Oh, ok. Go on. Well, he rushed up to me and found me standing near Robert with a gun in my hand. But the shot came from round the corner, from in front of me. You mean you didn't... No. Look at the gun, David. It hasn't been fired. Oh, Selma... Selma, forgive me. It's all right, David, of course I forgive you. Well, that's all settled. Come on, Nora. Good-bye, lieutenant. Good-bye, all. Now, wait a minute. Maybe he believes you. He's in love with you. But I got to have something more than that. Where's the gun? I've got to see that gun, Mrs. landis. I haven't got the gun. I... I gave it to David. David, where's... what is it, David? Selma, I thought you were guilty. I thought I was doing the only thing. I... I threw the gun away. You threw the gun away! This is the craziest case. But they can find it. I can tell them exactly where I threw it. I'll send divers down for it. Well, they've got to find it! Ah, phooey! She don't want that gun back any more than you do. Swear out a warrant for the arrest of Mrs. landis on the suspicion of murder. Here. Get some whiskey. Yes. For both of us. And that goes for you, too. Go on! What did you say? Hmm? Did you say something about scrambled eggs? No, darling. You must have been dreaming. Are you hungry? No. Why? Are you? You want some scrambled eggs, dear? 'Cause I can fix them for you if you want them. Oh, no, darling. I don't care for any. No? Sure? Really. Oh, well, good night, baby. Good night. After all, if I want scrambled eggs, I can get them for myself. Mm-hmm. Of course, I'm not as good a cook as you are. Uh-uh. Don't bother about me. You go right on sleeping, darling. I love to watch you sleep. You look so cute. Nicky? Have you any pictures of yourself taken as a baby? Hmm? No. No. Ah, that's a shame. I want to see what you looked like. Well... I'll have some taken in the morning. Poor Selma... Poor David. Nicky? Can you reach the water? Hmm? Can you reach the water? Mm-hmm. Oh, no, I don't want it. I just wanted to be sure you could reach it. Come on... I'll scramble those eggs. Now, if you can manage the bread, I'll whip you up some scrambled eggs that'll be a poem. I'm so glad you're hungry, too. Here. Chase this. Oh, no, no. This. Go get it. Now... Eggs, milk... Butter. Well... What's the matter? Oh, I'm thinking of poor Selma down in that jail. Now, don't worry, darling. Tomorrow they'll find the gun, and it won't have been fired, and Selma will be set free. But you don't really think she did it? No. Now, where's the salt? Over there. You're not saying that just to make me happy, are you? You really mean it? No. No, what? No pepper. Well, it's there, next to the salt. Oh, thanks. Then what? Yes, I mean it. Of course you're right. She didn't do it. She couldn't have done it. I don't think I'd kill you if you ran off with another woman. Well, that's something to look forward to. I might, though. Uh... You mind, sugar? Oh! Hey! Don't forget to shut the gate! Nick, what was it? Oh, it was a stone. Look! It's got a note tied to it! Ha ha! Silly little woman. I told her to stop writing me. Asta! Asta, drop that! Asta! Asta, drop that! That's a clue! Oh, he thinks we're playing! Nicky, Nicky, come help me! Look at him. Huh? Where is he? Over there. Has he got the... the n-o-t-e? Yes. Don't pay any attention to him. Just be nonchalant. Asta! Asta! D-d-darling, let me discipline him. Asta! Come here, this minute. You hear me? This minute! Asta! Asta! Ooh! Never mind me. Get him. Yes. Asta! Did you get it? Got the rock. Nick! Nick! He's eating it up! Asta... Here. Look! Ppp! Ppp! Pretty. Pretty. Pretty rock. Get the pretty rock! That-a boy! Asta, look, look! See? See the pretty rock? When he runs after the rock, you grab the paper. Get it, Asta. Get the pretty rock. That's a good doggy. I have it. "Mr. Charles, Phil Byrnes... "Alias Ralph west is a ex con... "And was married to Polly in topeker 3 years ago. He lives..." What are we supposed to do? Send him an anniversary present? Nicky, phone Abrams. And have him here keeping us up all night? Well, don't you see? If Phil is her husband, then he shot Robert because he found out about him and Polly. Nicky, you must phone. Well, just as you say. Here, you. Bad Asta. You swallowed that address. How could you? And I've been boasting about what a smart dog you were. Just for that, you sleep outside. Nicky? Paper! Paper! Extra! 10 cents a copy! Extra! I don't think Mr. Charles wishes to see anyone. You just tell Mr. Charles I'm here. That's all. Good morning, Peters. Mrs. Charles couldn't sleep, so I'm up. Good morning, Peters. Good evening, madam. Good evening? Well, it's only 6:30. Yes, sir. It's still dark. It's dark again, sir. You slept right through the day. Was it a nice day? A dreadful day, madame. The reporters and the police were trying to get up here all day. I guess we didn't miss a thing. Oh, quick, the morning papers. The morning papers are not out yet, madam. Not out yet? These are the evening papers. There you are. Well, it doesn't seem right, the evening papers with breakfast. If you hadn't wakened me, we'd have slept right through till morning, and then everything would have been all right. Mr. Charles, there's one of those policemen outside the door right now. What shall I do about it? Oh, show him in. He probably wants to question Mrs. Charles again. It doesn't say whether they found the gun. Oh, I forgot, I'm mad at you. Hmm! Look at him prancing around with that clue in him. Oh, hello, Mr. Abrams. Good morning. Good evening. Yes. Oh, yes. Good evening. Will you have some breakfast? Thanks. I just had dinner. Oh. I give up. Have the found the gun? No. Oh, Nick. Think you're gonna convict her if you don't find it? Maybe I do and maybe I don't. It's what the... it's what the D.A. Thinks. What about the other guns? Dancer's and Lum Kee's? They're .38's, all right, like he was killed with. But the experts say they're not the guns that did it. Oh. 50 will get you 250 that she didn't do it. You'd have to say that, being you're family. But that Lai Chi gang has got the best out in the world. They wouldn't have killed him till they cashed his check. His check? Oh, I forgot. You didn't hear about that. He gave Polly a check for $20,000 yesterday. $20,000? Robert never had $20,000 in his life. Yes, he did. I went to the bank to see about it. Here it is. His wife put this in his account just a couple of days ago. Looks all right. Have you got any of his checks? I got all of his, and they're ok, too. I just want the ones he gave to Polly. Well, here's the first one for $75. 75, that's better. And here's the next one for 100. 100? Going up, huh? Perfect. Forgery. Let me have the big check. Let me see! I've never seen a forged check. There you are. How do you have your eggs? Where's your phone? It's over there on the table between the bed. Well, I can't see anything. Mr. Charles, where is the rest of this phone? In the drawer. Hey, now, nice doggy. Will you tell him I just want to use the phone? Now, behave yourself, will you? Look out. Well, I don't understand. The signatures look exactly alike to me. That's just it. That's just what? Nobody writes this much the same twice. They traced these signatures from this first check. Oh... "Oooh..." Hello. Hello, Joe? Joe? Joe? Go down and pick up that Polly Byrnes for me. Ok. Say, do you want this thing back in the drawer? No, that's all right. Uh... Look, will you call this bloodhound off so I can get out of here? Asta! Asta, come here. Don't you know Mr. Abrams is on our side? What's the matter with you on this case? You're losing your grip. Get dancer yet? Yeah, he showed up as soon as it was light. Had a story about not wanting to be around when the shooting started, him without his gun. What about Phil? Found him? Nope. Somebody threw this through our window last night. Where's the rest of it? Asta ate it. Polly said it was a hotel on Turk street. That's right. Say... You want to give it a try with me? Yes, if you give me a couple of minutes to dress. Yes, you wait downstairs, we'll be right down. Hey, wait a minute! Where do you get that "we" stuff? I'm coming with you. Oh, not cured yet, huh? Certainly not. Don't worry, darling, I won't be in the way. Well, of course you won't, sugar. I just want to make sure. Nick! Nick! You dog! Let me out! You stay here, in case he tries to make a break. Is Phil Byrnes in? We ain't got no Phil Byrnes. Have you got a Ralph west? Yep. Is he in? I don't know. Any way of finding out? Walk upstairs if you want. Room 212. Get on the back stairs. Telegram for Mr. west. After you, my dear lieutenant. Dead, all right. Strangled. Beaten up some before the strangling set in. Someone's hair in his hand. Watch out. Pair of spectacles. I'll have the boys phone. We'll give this room a good casing. Here's another .38 for your experts to match up. I guess the heater is his, all right. He's wearing an empty shoulder holster... And I guess this is the key to that Byrnes girl's apartment. It's got her number stamped on it. Another good guess would be that Selma landis didn't do this. Fair enough. But he wasn't killed the way landis was either. I'd like to know what your laboratory says about that hair and those cheaters. Anything else on your mind? Yes. That key... could I borrow it for about an hour? Sure. How about your skeleton key just for good measure? All right. Say, what are you looking for? I haven't the faintest idea. Just a hunch. This is straight from the feedbag. They just found Phil's body, strangled to death. Say, that's tough. Polly's going to feel bad. Thanks. Polly in yet? No, police here, looking for her. Well, stall them. Keep them here. I'm going up to her place. Be back in a minute. Get out there! Wait, brother, wait. Say, what is this, bank night? Read all about the big murder! Extra! Paper! Read all about it! Flash news bulletin: A body believed to be that of the janitor was found in a hamper in the basement of 346 white street. Police linked this murder with the landis killing. Paper! Read all about the big murder! Murder! Murder! Murder! Sorry to have to ask you to come to a place like this. Is it Nick? Where is he? Is he hurt? No, he's all right. He's upstairs now. What I asked you down for is, we found a man's body here. He was a janitor in this building. Been dead about 24 hours. Shot near the phone there. Now the telephone company tells us that at about 7:30 last night... that'd be just before he was shot... someone here called up information and asked for Nick Charles' number. Now, Mr. Charles doesn't remember this "Pedro Domingues", and I thought perhaps you might be able... Pedro Domingues... He was my father's gardener... About 6 years ago. A small man with a mustache? Yeah, that's the one. Hello? Just a minute. Call for you, lieutenant. Would you mind going down and taking a look, just to make sure? Certainly, now. Would you take Mrs. Charles down? Right. Hello? Well, those glasses you found in Phil Byrnes' place... Are nothing but window pane. The hair is false, and the gun is not the one that was used on landis. Ah... You're a great help. Did you find out about the fingerprints in his room? Dancer's, eh? Well, that helps a little. No others? Ok. Oh... Get to work on this case, will you? And take a look at the bullet that killed this guy. Thanks. Funny you didn't recognize this Pedro Domingues. Why? Did Nora know him? Yeah. Used to be her father's gardener. Oh. Remember him now? Whoever remembers a gardener unless he squirts a hose at you? Here, hold this, will you? What is it? You'll see in a minute. Think Mrs. landis might know this Pedro? She might. And that aunt Katherine? Possible. What do you think you're doing? There it is. Hold that, will you? Well, what do you know about that? A ladder. Sure. And 50 will get you $2.50 that it just reaches down to Polly's apartment below... With this left over for good measure when he got there. Well, let's try it. Sure. This end first. How about it? You're right. Yeah. Now what'd you find out about the person who occupied this place? Not a thing. Not a fingerprint in the room, not a stitch of clothes, nothing. Anything in Pedro's books? No, just that someone named Anderson took it a week ago. Paid cash in advance. That's all, huh? Oh, there's a record of a new lock on the door. Bought it yesterday. Wait a minute. What does the card on the door say? That won't help you much. No, just Anderson. No front name. No Mr., Mrs., or miss. Isn't that just dandy? You know, I got a feeling if we could just find out who took this place... I took this. You took what? I took this picture. I found it in Pedro's apartment. I wanted to show it to you. You see, he was our gardener. These are the servants we had down at father's place. There's Pedro... And rose... And there's Annie... Oh, yes, darling, that's just fine, and I'm sure lieutenant Abrams will be very grateful. What do you think we ought to do? Bring them all up here, everybody that's mixed up in the case. Let's shake them all up and see what we get. Say, you're on. We're going to take him tonight? We're going to try. Come on, let's get something to eat. I'm thirsty. Well, how are you going to do it? I haven't the faintest idea. I'm just going to look and listen and pray that somebody makes a slip... just one slip. You get them all? They're coming. Selma... Take her upstairs. Nora, what is it? What does this mean? Darling, don't worry. Nick will fix everything. I wish I were as sure as she is. Figured out anything about the setup here? A little. What's your plan? Build up a case against each of them. Throw everything we've got at them and throw it hard enough to bounce. I'll make it bounce, all right. Hey, wait a minute... It's all right, let him in. What is it, Nick? Have they found the gun? Not yet. Selma's upstairs. Oh, she is? No talking, now. It's all right. I'll go with him. Oh, Selma... David! Now, none of that, none of that. No, no, sirree. Tom, what about a few more chairs? I'll keep my eye on them. Sure, Mr. Charles. Busybody. Thank you, Nick. This is outrageous! Bringing me to a place like this! Great. Oh, that's fine. Well, they're all here. Miss Forrest just came. Good. You didn't ask aunt Katherine? Oh, I thought we'd better return her hospitality, dear. We owe her something after last night. I'm going to get myself a box seat. Now, don't get so fresh! Take your hands off me! All right, sister, I just wanted to see if you had a gun. That's a new name for it. Just wait till you boys ask me to do another benefit for you. All right, inside. Say, is that Mrs. landis? Yes. Would you like to meet her? No, thanks. I've had enough of that family. How are you, Lum? I got restaurant to run. No time for this. If you're worried about the place, we'll have it closed up for you. Dancer. We almost ran into each other other earlier this evening. That so? Too bad I missed you. Oh, then it was you. Thanks, I wasn't sure. Where's Casper? His phone's out of order. Then why don't you send a messenger? What's the matter with you? Shut up, you! Cut out the chatter! Well, Nicholas? Ooh... I might have known that you were at the bottom of this. Come right in, aunt Katherine. How much more of this nonsense have I got to endure? We hope that this will be the last. Aunt Katherine, sit over here. Yes, uh... Oh, this must be Dr. Kammer. I've heard so much about you from David. Won't you come in and sit down? Just find a chair. I asked you all down here because we found another murder had been committed here. He's a man I think you all know. Pedro Domingues. Pedro? Killed? Yeah. Don't you read the papers? I was in the jug. Well, what do you know about him? Nothing. I only saw him a couple of times when I went to pay my rent. What about you? You're in and out of here. You must've known him. Sure, I known him. So what? And you? I never been to this house before. You? I have nothing to do with it. I'm here to attend Mrs. landis. You're here to answer questions. Did you know him? No. You knew him, Mrs. landis. I knew him? Yes, you remember him, Selma. He used to be our gardener at Ross. David, you remember him. Was he the man with the long white mustache? Yeah. What did you know about him? Well, nothing. That was 6 years ago. I haven't seen him since. What about you? I can't see what possible connection this could have with us! You don't, eh? Well, I'll tell you! Pedro and Robert landis were both shot with the same gun! Now, there was some monkey business going on down here that we want to find out about. You tell 'em, Mr. Charles. Yes, with pleasure. It seems that one week ago... Pedro rented this apartment to someone calling himself or herself Anderson. Did you ever see this Anderson? No. Ever hear him up here, above you? No. I thought not. He was rather clever and ingenious, this Anderson... Always wore gloves, never left a fingerprint. He intended, with the aid of this ladder, to crawl down into your place some night and Polish Robert off with this. Then he was going to climb back up here, unscrew the ladder... Throw it out that window on the dump heap down below... Then walk quietly out, leaving you holding the bag for Robert's murder. Now, do you know anyone who thinks enough of you to do that? Why... No. You're dancer's girl, aren't you? I work for him. That's not what he asked you. Well... We got an understanding. Did dancer know that you were going away with Robert? Why... Why... go on, go on! You told us before. You promised you'd keep that a secret! I'll never trust a cop again! Now listen, if you made her dicker with the cops, ok. But that ladder stuff is a lot of malarkey. No one did come down that ladder. And landis wasn't killed in her place. The only reason he wasn't killed in her place was that Anderson was found out. Pedro came in here yesterday to lay a new rug. He didn't like the looks of things, so he changed the lock on the door. When Anderson came in, he found that he was locked out. Then he heard Pedro telephone me downstairs... And he shot him. So what? So, who is Anderson? I'll bite. Who? Polly, Phil had a key to your apartment, hadn't he? Yeah. And so had dancer. Yeah. What about Lum? No, of course not. Anybody else? Nobody. Say, what do you think I do? Go around stuffing them under doors? He's trying to hang this murder on us to protect his family. If the janitor didn't think everything was on the up-and-up, why don't he call the cops? Why does he call you? Because it's a family affair! She knocked her husband off! Everyone knows that! I didn't, I didn't! Oh, yes, you did. Then you got that lug to throw away your gun. It isn't true! Now, that's a lie! Now, Mrs. landis... Mrs. landis... You knew your husband and Polly were friends, didn't you? No. But you knew there was a woman. Yes. And you knew this Pedro... Now, lieutenant... suppose we take up this check business... wait a minute, who's doing this, you or me? Well, it certainly never has been my party. Maybe this guy is right. How do I know? Were you ever in this room before? No. What about you? Why, of course not! What do you think... I'll tell you what I think! She had this room, and you knew about it. You knew she was going to kill her husband, and you had this Dr. Kammer here all ready for the nut alibi. I attended Mrs. landis just to make sure that she did not do anything desperate. Mrs. landis' mind is... Not balanced. Now, that isn't true. There's nothing the matter with her, it's you! You're trying to drive her crazy! There's another mental case, right there. Break it up! Wait a minute! Nicky! Nicky! Hey, what's the idea? This way, darling. Cut it out, will you? Darling, you have the nicest relatives and friends. Mr. Charles! Mr. Charles, don't walk off and leave me with this bunch. I wouldn't have said what I had if I hadn't been a little bit punchy. This gang has got me nuts! Aw, go on, Nicky. It's just getting good. Atta girl. All right, darling. Let me know when you've had enough. Now, take it easy. Well, suppose we all go about this thing quietly. Dancer? Uh... Oh, yes, there you are. You know, that check of Robert's for 20,000 was a forgery. So what's it to me? It was traced from another check. I still say, so what's it to me? Oh, just a minute, lieutenant... We'll handle it differently. Selma, did you deposit that check for $20,000 to Robert's account a couple of days ago? No. Oh, yes you did, Selma! I remember your telling me. Did you, Selma? Yes, I think perhaps I did. I must have. You think that Robert forged her signature, and you're trying to hush it up, aren't you? Aren't you? No. For years you've paid to hush up his scandals. Don't you see that that's just what they're counting on? Selma... is that the vanity case he sent you? Yes. And when you returned it, you sent a note along with it. Yes. You took a signature of that note, traced it on this check, and deposited it to Robert's account. Then you forged Robert's signature to the other checks and had Polly keep him busy until you cashed them. And then I suppose I knock him off and stir up all this fuss before I get the dough. What kind of a stumblebum does that make me out to be? You're the kind of a stumblebum that left your fingerprints all over the room when you killed Phil Byrnes. Phil's dead? Yes. Strangled. Well, I didn't do it. Then why did you go to his place? Because I thought he'd gunked my game. I figured he'd tried to hold up landis and had to kill him, so I pushed him around a little just to learn him manners. Ah, phooey! When I left him, he had a split lip and a couple of dents in him, but he was just as much alive as you are... If that means anything. Just a minute, lieutenant. Polly, who knew that Phil was your husband? What? You were married, weren't you? Yeah. So Phil was your husband? As if you didn't know. I didn't know it until now. I wish I had, baby. Didn't you ever tell anyone that you were married? No. Would Phil have told? No! He knew if dancer heard, I'd lose my job. Did you and Phil ever talk about it? Yeah. One night last week. But nobody could've heard. We were alone, down in my room. Oh. With these earphones, Anderson could hear everything that went on down in your place. Everything? Everything. Holy smoke! He knew more about all of you than you know yourselves. Dancer, you went to Phil's room right after you pulled the switch at the Lai Chi, didn't you? Yes. That was about 1:00. What time was Phil killed? About 4:00, as near as we can figure. At 4:30, Anderson threw this note through my window. He was beginning to make use of the information he gathered while he was up here. Dancer, how do you spell "married"? Get Casper on the phone. We're past that. Polly, how do you spell "married?" M-a-r... Um... M-a-double r... Y-e-d thank you. You see, when it comes to words like that, an illiterate person... what do you mean, illiterate? My father and mother were married right here in the city hall! Having a good time, Mrs. Charles? It couldn't be better. This note is a poor attempt at illiteracy. The easy words are spelled wrong, and the tough ones are spelled right. Like to see it, Lum? That was meant just to get me down to Phil's place... To find his body... And your fingerprints, dancer. Somebody's framing you. You say you don't know this Pedro. No. Well, there's a picture of him over here. Perhaps this will refresh your memory. Were you in on this check business? I know nothing about it. You lie! You were up here with those earphones on, listening to everything. You were sore because they weren't cutting you in on it. You followed landis that night and tried to stick him up, but something went wrong and you had to kill him! I do not kill Pedro. I do not follow Mr. landis. Ask dancer. I go with him to get air. So you're the one that's framing me, huh? You weren't with me! You can't use me for an alibi! You're dirt! Wait! Just a minute, please. All this time I've been waiting for someone to make a slip. Someone has made it. We've been wrong. This wasn't a killing for money. It was a murder of hatred... And revenge. Polly, what did Phil go to the pen for? Blackmail. Blackmail. Did you and Phil talk about that, too, down below? Yes. Thank you. David, when were you supposed to give Robert the money to go away? This morning. In cash? Yes. And when he decided to go last night, you had to give him bonds. Yes, that's right, Nick. But where did you expect to get cash on new year's day, a bank holiday? Well... Funny, I forgot about that. No, you didn't, David. You never intended to give Robert that money. You didn't want him to go away. You wanted to kill him. You wanted to get even with him because he took Selma away from you. Nick, please, I... Nora, is he fooling? Oh, no. But you were fooling, David, when you said that you hadn't seen Pedro in 6 years. You said that he had a long white mustache. Well, he has a long white mustache now... But look at that picture. There he is, 6 years ago... And his mustache is neither long nor white. You didn't notice him 6 years ago any more than I did. You remember him as you saw him last night, when you shot him. You killed him, and then you killed Robert. Phil saw you do that. That's why he followed you. That's why he was on your fire escape. He was going to blackmail you. So you killed him, too. And then you threw that note into my window, hoping to throw me off your trail. David! David, don't let him say those terrible things. Tell him it isn't true! Tell him it isn't true! Ask him why he threw your gun away, Selma. He knew that it hadn't been fired and that you'd only have to show it to prove your innocence, yet he threw it away. Ask him why he did that. David, say you didn't do it! Wasn't it because you hated her as much as you did Robert? Wasn't it because you wanted to get even with her, too? Wasn't it because you wanted to see her hang for Robert's murder? Oh, David. Tell her the truth, now, David. You don't have to pretend anymore. All right, it's true, every word of it. I've hated her, hated them both ever since she threw me over for Robert. I've been planning and waiting and watching for the time to come when I could get even with them for ruining my life! I killed Robert, but not the way I wanted to... it was too quick, too easy! I wanted to see him suffer like he'd made me suffer! I wanted to see you hang. I wanted to see you go gradually madder and madder and madder until the day finally came when you were going to hang! Well, I made a mess out of everything, all right! I don't want a single move out of any one of you. All right, Selma. I may not see you hang... But I'm going to see you die. Don't be a fool, David. Get out of the way, Nora. Nora, let me go. He will. No jury will hold you responsible. Dr. Kammer was right. I got 6 bullets in this gun. One for her, one for myself... Yeah, one for myself... And the rest are for anybody who tries to stop me! Get out of the way! Give me that gun! Get him up! Nicky! I'll kill her! Get him out! I'll kill her! Good heavens, I was right. The man is crazy. I can't believe it! David! Well, you certainly can pick them. Nice work, Abrams. Nice work. Oh, yeah? Come on, dancer! What for? For about 10 years for forgery. And not counting the potshot you took at Mr. Charles. Come on, get outta here. You, too, sister. Listen, this wasn't my idea. You were in with him, weren't you? Yeah, but... well, you're going to be in with him again. Come on! Nicky, are you sure you're all right? I'm afraid so. Nice work, Lum. And you sent his brother up. Sure, Mr. Charles sent him up. Number one detective. I don't like my brother. I like his girl. I'm your friend, you betcha. Here's to a very pleasant trip abroad. London, Paris, Vienna, and points east. Ah, splendid, Dudley, splendid. You're getting better every trip. The telegraph board at the last station said there's a lot of telegrams for Mr. Nick Charles. Who's Nick Charles? I never heard of him. That's what I said. Fine! Your room's ready, ma'am. Thanks. Well, good night, dear. Good night, sleep well. Don't worry, I shall. Good night, Nick. And thanks so much for everything. I want to kiss you. May I? Go right ahead. It's a hard habit to get out of. Good night, Selma. Nora! What's the matter, Nick? It isn't true. What isn't true? Shh! Pinch me. Why? Pinch me! It is true. What? We're alone. No family, no friends, no reporters, no police, no nothing. Good! I suppose we ought to decide where we're going. Why, do you care? No. But I haven't any clothes. Well, what's the difference? Saves you the trouble of packing. And I don't need anything in the world, darling, but you... And a toothbrush. What's that, hmm? Hmm. Looks like a baby's sock. Hmm. And you call yourself a detective. Why, Mrs. Charles...
