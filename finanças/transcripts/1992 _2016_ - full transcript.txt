You shoot movies? - Pretty much yeah. - Can I? You hold it like binoculars? Am I recording now? No, stop, I don't like it. I've got to get back to the school. Stay safe, have a rest. See you tomorrow. You didn't buy a thing. Can you tell me why? I forgot. You forgot? When I get home in the morning, I'm starving. - Can I count on you or not? - Yes, Dad. Watching TV all evening, are you? - Not got any homework? - But, Dad, please! "Dad, please!" Arsehole. What are you up to there? Oh, shit. That's good. - Two seconds! - Come out, now!

Walk right past me tomorrow. Why don't you just act like kids your age? How do kids my age act? They don't spend their days filming people. They don't follow guys down hallways. - They go clubbing, have fun. - I can't. It hurts my ears. You don't party, don't smoke. You're boring. That's right. When does your dad get in? 7:30. We've got two hours left. Stop! The Beautiful Ship. "I shall name for you, indolent sorceress, "The marks of beauty adorning your youth "I shall describe your beauty, childhood blended with maturity." Thank you, Aur√©lien. Now, Florine. "You sweep by in flowing skirts, "like a trim ship putting out to sea under full sail "and rolling lazily to a slow, easy rhythm." Come in. Sorry, the principal wants to see Martin Bouvard. Martin. Take your stuff. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Hi, Dad. - Martin, come here for a bit. What the hell's this? Can you explain? Are you on drugs? Martin I asked you a question, are you on drugs? No, it's not mine. You're losing it. Look. An empty fridge. I've asked you four times. What's going on in this house? What's up with you, Martin? Stop. Where are mine? At the back? - Want more? - All right then! It's good spending time together. We just cross paths all the time. Thanks. Here you go. And now you've seen what it's like. You can come work with me on school holidays. Make some pocket money. And it's cool, no worries, nothing much goes on at night. You know I was once your age, too. We've all messed up in our own way. But with everything on TV, watch out. Promise me you'll be careful. Martin? I promise. Oh, no. Act as if I wasn't filming you. If you film me, I want to get paid. I'm warning you, I'm serious. I'll pay you if I ever use it for something. Come on, put that away. Subtitling: TITRAFILM
