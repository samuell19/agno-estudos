KARAOKE CRAZIES Yes? I said you'll get it later! It'll be deducted from the deposit anyway! I'm cleaning up, let's talk later. Got a room? Just look at it, it's completely empty. Give me a room! Just go in anywhere. Let's say you caught a mermaid, is it human on top or bottom? Top! If it's bottom, spread them legs! Boss, bring us 3 helpers, and beers? 10 beers please. It's too remote for helpers... It'll be a sausage fest without helpers. Listen, why aren't you doing your best? Call some then, get us 1 young hottie. This is Addiction Karaoke on the way to the reservoir. It is indeed far. So it's not possible? DIRECTED BY KIM SANG-CHAN "UTILITY BILL PAST DUE" "SINGING HELPER WANTED, HOUSING PROVIDED" Come! Hurry up! Come here! Hurry! "SINGING HELPER WANTED, HOUSING PROVIDED" One, two, three, four! "Listen to the voices!" "Come this way, please come!" - "Be prepared!" - "For that day!" "The Rapture will come!" We sincerely hope that we'll all go to heaven together. You want us to die together? Amen Is this real estate office? I'd like to sell my house. I smoked only one from a new pack... Holy cow! This is the biggest room here, and the washroom has instant hot water. We get delivery food once a day, so you can eat with me, the rest is up to you, have ramen or whatever. You asked about internet, right? Use the router there. Washroom's in the lobby. Good night. Sir... The door... "SINGING HELPER WANTED, HOUSING PROVIDED" Don't just stand there, sit and eat with me. It'll stink up the room, so let's eat out here. Come. Eat. Got a helper? What? - Helper. - Right. This way. Is this your private room? Vase, and laptop, so cool. And you're wearing a track suit? Are you a helper? Who the heck cares. I only need to sing my heart out for an hour or so. I'm fucked. $15 for the room, $20 for the helper... What a shit hole, so hot here. Delivery! Food's here! Breakfast! - Breakfast! - Mom! Shut the door! What's up with the yelling? Did she just call me 'mom'? Put one in front of that room. Use the spatula! It doesn't grab well... Don't taint the soup with your chopsticks! Is there a room? In the week since you got here, 10 people asked for a helper. 7 of them complained and asked for refund. 2 of them said they'd never come back. The last one... slapped my face. What the hell is the matter?! Don't you know? Wash yourself for once! You always ask me to suck you off! Am I your bidet? Do something about your track suit too! You can't serve patrons like that. Let's go. I'm sorry. "RAMEN SEASONING POWDER" Did you eat ramen at night? Wait. There used to be a factory here, but when it shut down, things slowed down... I'm not doing this to raise you. Do you understand? I don't know what you do with your laptop all day, and I know you can't live without internet. Internet may cut off this way. Hold on. Hello? This isn't real estate office, it's a karaoke! What I'm saying is... This was always a real estate office! Whatever! So the real estate... Where were we? Dammit... Anyway, this can't continue, okay? Stupid real estate office! So sick of it! Will the internet really cut off? The thing about you is, you're more refreshing than beautiful! You got that something! Here comes the song! We're a dynamic duo! Come on out! You said you knew this song! We got to maintain this flow! I'm really sorry. Sir, I had fun. That customer... he had no complaints. What a mess. That was great. Good night. Sir? Have you had a lot to drink? You can go in now. WANTED What is it? Supposedly, he sprints 100m in 8 seconds. This man? Seoul's going crazy over that guy. Really? You don't watch TV or read the papers? No. Anyway, he's got an addiction, murder addiction! And rape addiction. Kids or adults, he only kills women. He stabs them with knives or shivs! Only if he came to our town... If you see him, call him in, there's a reward. See you. Also, I'm told he's a master of disguise. Bye. Your mouth hurts? Ventilation is bad in the basement, so the candlelight sucks the smoke. The smoke, it sucks the smoke... What else should I sing? Just cum please. 'Just Cum Please'? Never heard that song. Could you get on with it? Ejaculate! You're just a cocksucker, you can't tell me what to do! All right, let's concentrate. Concentrate... Sir! Sir! - You can't do that! - Who the hell?! Please come with me outside, we can talk there. - Let go! Let go! - Okay. Delivery! Let's eat! Haven't I seen you somewhere before? Where was it? Never mind, let's eat. Have some sausage, you asked for it. Saving it for later? Why didn't you do this before? Do you have 2 tongues? I think I'm addicted to you. Come here! Holy cow...Fine. I'm sorry. Do you ever wash up? We're in service business, you should clean yourself up. - Not even your face? - I brush my teeth. Your honesty is an assault to me. Don't be so confident. Your fart will begin to stink one day. Stop it! At least wash your clothes! Have the rest. Parcel delivery. "TO: LEE HA-SUCK" Take it down when we get customers. Your name is LEE Ha-suck? Washed your undies? So you got nothing on? Want some...coffee? Dress too short? Sit down. Here. Do you only watch porn? To be precise, I only listen. You fall asleep to it. Not that different from playing games all day. Do you even sleep? Now and then. We're strangely similar. You haven't gone outside in a month. Why not? People. But you get along with other gamers, right? I'm more comfortable with people in porn. When's Christmas? I dunno. You can't keep track of dates when you're down here. Game over. Your first month salary, minus the advance. I couldn't have predicted this. Good work. Not gonna count it? Feels good? How about a drink? Don't be that way, can't drink? Not exactly. Okay! It'll be fun to drink with a person for once. At this rate, we'll be the most popular karaoke in town! "We"? It's all thanks to you. Cheers, good work. You knew. Knew what? How I made this place so popular. You knew what I was doing, but why never mention it? So you could deny it when we're caught? Or... afraid that I wouldn't do it anymore? I thought you'd be... embarrassed. That's bullshit! Watcha looking at? You normally talk a lot. I have a question. Yeah? Do you think about it when you look at me? I am curious though. Then give me $20. Hey, hey, hey! Sons of bitches! I'll kill anyone who touches me. I got to quit drinking or something... You look... - really terrible. - You got that right. It's fortunate that you weren't hurt badly. "Fortunate"? I may have a concussion, do you even remember? I'm...sorry. You can hit me. My mother said to me, the worst kind of men are those who hit women. I wish she'd have taught my dad that. Hello there! I'm a 29-year old pro helper OH Na-ju. Still hiring? Without experience... What experience, first experience? Do I look like a virgin? One moment. Tada! Entertaining is my second nature. Does this body look inexperienced? - Sit down. - Okay. Having a nice body is one thing, but keeping up with the patrons... Don't you worry and bring on the patrons! - Married? - Very single. But... But why come to a small town when I could go anywhere? My specialty is salvaging dead shops. You should feel lucky. So lucky. I'll work hard. Which one is standby room? Wait... It must be that way. That fucking asshole... Why the hell is he taking off his pants? He says we do everything, what does he mean? Well... Hey! Why you little. Do you suck anything in sight? - Don't be like that... - I got things to say! Come here. Don't you hear me? Let go! She needs to hear this! What's with her? See that? She's a total bitch! Boss, is this a brothel? This is prostitution! It wasn't always like this... Fine, it was me. I can't sing nor dance, and I wanted to go back to games. Doesn't mean you have to. This isn't about me not doing it. If we're caught, I'm going to jail too! This place will be shut down! Don't you know? It's a small town... More reason to be careful! Words travel fast! That mouth is for eating. I got to shut that mouth up somehow. Emergency meeting later! Come in, welcome to Na-ju's room. I won't bite, come sit down. How is it that we only have snacks and ramen here? Don't get grocery? Think of it as my welcoming party. Drink at your own risk. Cheers! That's good, so good. I don't really say this because it creates confusion, but I majored in economics. Don't believe me? You said you did this since 17. I couldn't deny my true self, so I enjoyed night life since then. How could I deny myself? I'll buy. Another shot! Even karaokes have business principles. We need hook people for repeat business, but not with blowjobs. We had a few walk-ins. Don't you know it's a temporary solution? Hey! Hey! I'm talking to you! This is for your own good. Listen carefully. Post-discharge emptiness! Once a man orgasms, he feels sudden emptiness... throughout his body. They're simply done. Their needs are different before and after the deed. So what do we do? How do we use their desire and turn it into addiction? Tease and bait. You show, but barely, and never give it all! Understand? 'Is she into me'? Seed a fantasy in them. That's when he'll become addicted, and what comes next? Money, of course. It's called "added value", okay? You'll do what I tell you now. Cheers! Boss! 6 beers and fruit tray please! Okay! Where the heck is my pack? Whole thing's gone now. Is it a ghost or what? I can't believe it. If my customer went into yours, you should've sent him to me! You just sucked him off? I really didn't know! You deserve an Oscar for that performance. He said he asked for me by my name. Be the bigger man, she probably didn't know. What's the use of my lecture? A helper's job is to help patron feel happy with songs and dances. You're a perverted helper. You'll always lose to the traditional helpers like me! Sure, keep at it and you'll be a helper for life. You're a real pro. - Why you little... - Enough already. The regulars are the bad guys. This isn't an easy life for me too. I live because I can't die. Living is supposed to be harder than dying. "ADDICTION" You're like a little kid. Thank you! You'll get diabetes. Boss, isn't she a bit weird? How so? Why'd a young hottie like her hole up here and give blowjobs? I really don't get it. She's a mystery to me too. Shouldn't you at least know your employees? And she's a live-in employee. - 'Live-in'? - Totally. Hey! We're in the business of making men happy. Smile for once. Only the simple ones grin like fools. That whiny ass... Even the sluttiest girl can end up marrying a good guy. It's not too late for you! Do it right! And stop watching porn! Korean men are #1 only in libido! Boss? How about a drink? I got to make peace with her too. Let's do it next time. Fine, I'm off. Have a good night. Turn off the sign on your way out? You guys are like vampires! No one ever goes outside! How's that any different than being dead? How's that any different than being dead? How's that any different than being dead? Why did you call the cops?! Bring Min-ji back! Please! You're the one who left her alone! She was taken because of you! Am I wrong? Good bye. Very good. Sir, you could go in... Did you...pay? Was it the quiet room? Please. I don't think I saw him come in... How much longer? The loud room is not for a while. I said I want the quiet room! You can go in next. Okay- This is so confusing, quiet room, loud room... Why so soon... You can go in now. Okay, good. Weren't you just in the quiet room? What are you doing here? Sir? Sir? Sir? Just talk to me, have you been living there? It's pitch dark in there, are you a mole rat? He's got brass balls. He took my smokes, snacks, ramen and liquor. Since when have you lived there? Or did you just sleep there and leave for work everyday? Ha-suck's clientele is all the same. He's no client. I think he hid there and came out when it was busy, pretended to be a customer and got freebies. Judging from the trash, it must've been a month, right? You're not better! How could you have not known? Couldn't even imagine, that door was locked for 3 years. Hey, just get out of here. I'm gonna call the police. Trespassing, robbery, freebies with the helper! What crime is the freebie? Mister, leave! You're really in for it! It's all over! - Get out of here! - I'm calling! Big Mole! Big Mole! You already mopped here, so do it over there. Long story. Preemptive Merry Christmas! Season's greetings! I did my part. He works here? You know him? Of course. He lived near the station. Is he homeless? Of course not. He married a blind girl, even had a kid together. She took the kid to the market and barn! Hit-and-run, a drunken biker. Sliced in half. The motorcycle? No, his wife. Since then he's never been the same. He's been roaming for a long time. Anyway! I'm here because of that thing, that serial killer I mentioned before. He's after adult entertainment employees now. We're not adult entertainment. Karaoke's considered that, no mistake about it. Sexual stuff... Oral stuff. Like this? Report anyone suspicious! I'm off. Twice, maybe? He looked at me and left. Anyway... So you'll keep him? What can I do? Winter's coming. He's deaf, and a mute to boot. Ever get sick of it? Is it good? Delicious? Got a room? Boss! Ha-suck! Hurry! I always wanted to do this. Stripping at karaoke! Me too, dancing blues naked. Is this place making everyone so horny? Maybe just the perverts come here. There aren't any normal ones. It'd be so nice to go drinking on a rainy day like this. They're all hermits... You should wear more clothes, aren't you cold? Or wear fur panties, or leggings. Save amateurish advices for amateurs. People think I suffer from exhibitionism. But that's what's putting food on our table. Ha-suck! Chicken feet! How come she only wears that dress? Is that her uniform? And those flip-flops. When a girl can't attract a man's attention, she's done. Stop nagging her. Boss! Look at me. You think this is all me? Half of it is the dress. How do I look? Like a model, right? Porn is all there is to you. Aren't you the happy one. Do I look happy? What's with you? Getting drunk before sunset? No work today? Wait till I find you! I'll eat you! i got you! I found you! What do you look like? Let's see... Honey! Min-ji! Honey! Min-ji! Boss! Boss! Good thing that she switched your pills. We were all doing so well. It's all over when you're dead, you're being selfish. It is selfish. Very much so. .. wanted to die without a debt, and without harming anyone, so I started this karaoke. Did you know? How could you, I never told anyone. .. All my life, I never said anything bad to anyone. But... I told one lie... to the man who tore up... my life in pieces. One tantrum to a wife I loved! Those two things... completely destroyed my life. I'm selfish. My wife and my child, whom I loved, are gone, but I'm still alive. I still eat. I sleep too. I watch porn. I'm selfish. Why? Because I'm still alive. Welcome. I'm here to see Na-ju. Na-ju? She's not in yet. Do what you were doing. Very comfortably. So this is the famous quiet room. Very good. I hate singing. I don't need that. You got a painful memory. And you lost a loved one too. Mom? Yeah? I can see what troubles you, what you're thinking. I ran an antique shop and studied for 40 years. Look at it. You know this beautiful thing is the root of all evil. Are you still afraid? This is what will set your pain and suffering free, the candle of freedom. Feel this scent. Use your body to welcome new sensations. Okay- Very good. No, once more, louder! Mom! I'm sorry! Good, very good, doesn't it feel nice? That's it, trust me! I will now free you, very good. Now, stand up, stand up. You must shed everything, burden in your heart. You must burn everything. Your clothes are on fire, it's on fire! What do you do? You must take it off at once! Isn't it hot? Aren't you sorry for your mom?! Good, good. That's it. Stop! That's enough. I like it when it's slightly covered. Very good. Now come to me and tighten this belt. I'm begging you. Transfer all your pain over to me. Come on. That's it. Harder! Ha-suck! What're you doing?! Na-ju's scent, I love it! Feels good to be in hiding? You had to do it to that poor child? Child? She had melons for tits. Don't you have family? What if something goes wrong and you die? I got no family. How did you find me? There's nothing I don't know. Good for you. Must be nice to know everything. This room is by the hour, so either sing, or just sit there. I can never forget. Only you gave me the greatest pleasure. Open the bag, it's full of money you love! If you treat me good, it's all yours. “Nurse Che?' Na-ju? Hi! I'm okay to talk. Hey! Na-ju! No! Too loud! Na-ju! Turn it off! Move that mike! Someone help me! Right, you're deaf. Do you know what we have in common? We're all alone. That's why it's so painful. But you're better off... Without sound, I can't tell if I'm alive or dead. No, I just need to hear it. I just need the sound... Boss. I think it'll get warm. I think I'll sleep well. Boss! This is why they call me the pro. I'm a buried treasure in this shit hole. So, please come again. Don't forget good investment tips. Have a good night, thank you! - Don't come outside, it's cold. - It's okay, I'm hot blooded. Good bye, take care! Holy shit, it's cold! Hot damn! Wait until they're out of sight before gloating. You're all damn moles. Always ramen in the basement... I'm sick of it! Let's go! I'll use all my tips! You're all so pitiful, I'll spend my own money. Boss, Ha-suck, Big Mole. Let's go, drink, drink! Christmas is in 2 days. Right, Ha-suck? Think of it as a private bubble. It'll be just us. Let's get icy cold draft beer and steamy fried chicken! And sweet and sour snails too. Or barbecue eels and soju? Soju is best with billfish. Even better! Now we're talking! Let's just order in. Who delivers draft beer? It'll be flat, such a waste of money. Flat beer is useless like dry humping. Out! We could get supplies too. This isn't a bomb shelter! Boss, do you remember what fresh whipped cream tastes like? Do what I say! Just go out this once, and if it fails, you could dig a cave here! I won't ever nag you then! Christmas is in 2 days! Damn...l wasn't gonna say this, but... - today is... - Let's go. Must I buy my own birthday cake? At least she took the hint. Thanks, anyway. Chicken and beer here, then eels and soju, then cake back at the karaoke! All good? Okay? Over here! Happy birthday to me! Cheers! Boss, if something happens to me, could you do me a favor? What do you mean? Can you promise me? It's not like you. You deaf bastard! I caught the dog food thief from my shop! What's going on? Stop that! Just talk it over! It's not like he committed a sin! Wait, it's the pro helper. From the karaoke. The one with nice body! How much is the dog food? Is this enough? Go away. Now! Can we join you? We were gonna go to where girls are. We're having a private party. Don't be like that. How about we go to their karaoke now? - Let's go! - Stop that! You must be drunk, please just go. The sucker! She's famous! She was in that porn! The rape girl, gang rape! You sons of bitches! Did you know about her video? We shouldn't have left... We wasted money when we should be earning. It's okay! We can make it up tomorrow! You cheer up too. We can work hard after the holidays. You are terrifying...and merciless. What? So long as it's not you, right? How could you say that? You know I don't wish ill will. I know she's hurting. Let's drop it. No, I won't drop it. Go on, continue your tirade! Don't be so fixated on money, you look petty. Now you know about her, how could you utter those words? You knew what she was up to, but you turned the other cheek! We're the same! Don't pretend to be righteous! But at least I... Forget it, let's drop it. Why must we show that we're hurting? Why's it raining in the winter? Hey, honey! So pretty! Don't open it! It's for Ha-suck! I'll give it to her myself! Happy birthday. I'm sorry about yesterday. Forget it. I'm not proud of it as well. I'm sorry. I'm sorry too. - Boss? - Yeah? Do you remember our promise yesterday? What promise? About eating chicken, then eels... Come on... I know, about your niece. Adorable. Isn't she? Take it easy. The only thing you can do right now is cry. Everyone's spending Christmas with family. We'll set a record, not a single client. Speak of the devil! Sweetie, is it not fun? Not even a word. How bad was the accident? Did you get plastic surgery? Jaw alignment? Guys don't do that. Should I sing another? How about a carol? Hey! You can't do that. This is the loud room, you got the wrong room. The quiet room is out of service today. Tomorrow is Christmas, so... But promise me! Don't tell others. Not here. Baby... I missed you so much! What are you doing here? Jin, where's Jin? Why did you leave home? This was the best you could do? But I... needed to make a living and raise her. Of course you do. We all got to. Where's Jin? To her real dad? Baby, I'm sorry! Please forgive me! She's still at the shelter! The burn was so painful, please forgive me! Tell me which fucker it is, I'll kill him. How could I convince you, she's our child! Please believe me, she looks so much like you! Shut up, you bitch! Thought you could flee and start over? Is it fun? Was it? Help! Somebody! Ha-suck! Boss... It burned out. Where's that candle... Why am I always looking for it? Have a good night. What a weirdo. Why was he so startled? The candle... "WANTED" The day she died... No, on her birthday... she wanted to give you this. Of all people, why me? I couldn't bear just die... I can only think about it... I'm really sorry. To be honest... I've never... .. It was him, that infamous one! He actually came to this shoddy karaoke! Isn't that amazing?! That was my chance! Had I been here, I coulda knocked him out! He's identified now! Some time ago, he poured hot oil on his own kid. It was on the news. That fucker became a serial killer! His mom went crazy because she didn't know who his father was. Then his wife did the same, and he didn't want his kid to suffer. His past and reality crashed in his head. He hates all women, his wife or a bar girl, or even his kid, anyone for that matter. The thing about Na-ju was, she wasn't alone! Will he ever come again? I need your help. It was so hard tracking her down. This'll be better than the shelter. With her mother...gone. You're doing something good. She said it was her niece... Na-ju was her...mother? Yes, it's her daughter. Killer is her father. He's been killing people trying to find her. Her mom's now dead. Read the news for once. That's why she was so desperate to make money. Be strong daddy, I'm here for you. Your dad mustn't hear that. Here. We're closed! I said we're closed. We're closed! "GIVE ME A CALL" Hello? Hello? Goddammit, who are you? Why is my child with you? Are you someone special to Jin? Or to Na-ju? What do you want? Huh? Isn't that what I should be asking? You're asking the father of a kidnapped child what he wants. How could I respond to that? 'Kidnapped'? Enough of this, now you know who I am. I'll let everything go, so do as I say. If I'm the kidnapper, shouldn't I be saying that? So you wanna dance, eh? Please let me hear Jin's voice, I'm begging you. I'll give you all the money. Please sir! - Min-ji! Min-ji! - Is that what you want? Please let me hear Min-ji's voice! I'm begging you! I'll give you the money! I didn't call the police! No, I wasn't trying to lie. I didn't mean to deceive you! Please forgive me, you have to believe me! Daddy! Daddy! Min-ji! Min-ji! Hello? Hello? Why isn't he answering? Don't try to be a hero. Bring her to the reservoir. In exactly 30 minutes. No cheating. You cheated. I've never killed a man before. I don't get out much, I'm just winded. She's down there. What are you trying to pull? Are you a cop? Uncuff me. I said uncuff me. Do as you please. Stab me or cut me. After you kill me, will you drag my body around? Uncuff me! You asshole! Uncuff me! Come here, you bastard! Come here! You psychotic bastard! Let go! You crazy bastard! Where you going? You need to die! That's enough! What a nut job...Crazy fuck. If you want to die, die alone, asshole. That's weird... Why karaoke, of all places. Another person died at a karaoke in Seoul. I heard he owns a big antique shop. He was found naked with a belt around his neck. He was pretty rich too! You know that killer found dead in the reservoir? It's a murder. He was beaten to death, he was unrecognizable His hand and dick were severed. I'm so scared. Boss! Guess what I have here. I feel awkward about this... You know that new factory near the reservoir? We got a report from it. What report? That your helper gives blowjobs... Welcome! Father, this way. - Come in. - Hi, there. Good to see you again. Who the heck is making false reports? - I'm off then! - Take care. Here we go! It's going in! "BASEMENT RENT AVAILABLE" "FAMILY KARAOKE - 2F"
