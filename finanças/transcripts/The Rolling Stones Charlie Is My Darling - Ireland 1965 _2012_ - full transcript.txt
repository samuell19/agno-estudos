One's brought up to think that pop music is a very ephemeral thing and it lasts for nothing. So, when we first made a record and it got in the charts, we thought, "Well, it's good. We'll probably be around for a year or maybe a year and a half, and then it's all gonna be over." I like the fella that plays the drums. - Charlie. - Charlie. - You like him? - Yeah. I just took up the drums. I can't read. I'm not a musician of that caliber. Maybe it's just standards I'm looking at. Maybe it's just an inferiority complex you got. Maybe I'm great after all. And who do you like in the group then? - Brian Jones. - Brian Jones. - For what reason? - I just like him. Just plays it cool. Let's face it, the future as a Rolling Stone is very uncertain. My ultimate aim in life was never to be a pop star. I enjoy it...with reservations, but I'm not really sort of satisfied either artistically or personally. - Does anybody like Bill Wyman? - Yeah! I like his style. - His...? - Style. What do you like about Bill Wyman? I always wanted to be a musician. I always wanted to be in a band. And I knew it was so impossible and so unlikely that I would be that I just dismissed it. And suddenly, last year, I remembered, you know, after all that time, suddenly remembered that I'd always wanted to be and now I was, you know. It didn't mean a thing to me anymore. Why are you coming to see the show? Who are you going to see? - Keith Richard. - Keith Richard. - You don't think they're dirty, do you? - No. No, you like 'em. - I just like him. - You just -- Why do you like Mick? Because I just like him. - Everything. - Well, what's everything? Everything. What's everything? Oh, jeez. - I like his hair. - Just his hair? I like him. He's -- I just like him. I don't know why. He's very nice. - I love his movements. - What? - Hair. Do you like his hair? - I love his hair, yes. You think he's sexy? You're not the same person os stage as you are the rest of the time. What sort of person do you think you are os stage? I don't really know. I don't really know... what I am os stage. It's very different because you have to treat everybody differently. You have to be very, very, very egotistical 'cause that's -- I mean, you're acting. You're doing an act for them. It's not really you. What do you set out to do in your act? Entertain people. ♪ Heart of Stone♪ Greg, close that door. Step back. That was great! The Rolling Stones here in the car, they want you to give them a wee welcome over the radio here. And I've got the tape recorder going here. How's the size and welcome compare to the Beatles? ♪ Heart of Stone♪ - Do you play in a group? - Yeah, The Creatures. - The...? - The Creatures. - The Creatures. - Yeah. When did you first grow your hair long? - About 18 months ago. - Why? 'Cause I like long hair. Oh, I don't know anything about groups at all. Of course, if I was about -- What am I now? -- I was about 22 years younger, I'd have a little group of me own if I could. There's a bit of go in me, still, even though I am 40. Has your daughter got their records? No, not really. Only "Off the Hook". - Well, you've heard it? - Yeah, and "Little Red Rooster". - Are you going to see them tonight? - I can't, no. - You're not? - No. - Why? - Didn't get a ticket. - Did you try? - Yes. What a shame. Are you going to see the show tonight? - No, I'm not. - You're not? Why not? I just didn't have no tickets to go. Did you see them when they were in Ireland before? - You did. What did you think? - I thought they were fantastic. - You did? - Yes. Is that why you're going to see them again tonight? Yes. Don't put that in. No, just sort of hold it back there, you know? As far back as this. - This direction. - Oh, I see. - Do one more. - Finished? No. - Did it work? -It didn't work. I used to work with David Bailey, though“. ♪ Play with Fire♪ We want the Stones!

Any sort of physical contact. Touching you. Touching your coat, your hair, or pulling you or kissing you or whatever it is. Just to say, "I touched so-and-so," you know. A crowd always seems to make for violence, because if there's a center of a crowd, all the people os the periphery of the crowd are trying to get to the middle. All the kids in the front row can't see a thing, so they stand up os their seats. So, the row behind stands up and the row behind... And in the end, you've got everybody standing up, and they still can't see, and they start falling backwards, and, you know, the seats start getting broken, and the officials keep pushing back all the time, and the kids are not fighting the officials half the time. They're trying to see, you know. They tend to do it at everybody's show. I wouldn't say the Beatles were the symbol of authority -- anti-authority -- but when the Beatles went to Germany, for instance, the same thing happened.

Not only romantic in so far as every song's about boy-girl relationships -- which is romantic in one sense. But every song was just like -- just like romantic lyrics. Just all about things that don't really happen or don't really happen all the time. If you listen to all popular songs 10 years ago, very few of them actually mean anything or have any relation to what people are doing. They don't -- Songs didn't have any relation to what people actually spend their lives doing, like getting up, washing, going to work, coming back, and feeling very screwed up about certain things. They were just about being unhappy 'cause your girl had left you or being very happy because you just met somebody. That's all they were ever about.

In the last two or three years, young people have been -- this especially applies to America -- instead of just carrying os the way that their parents told them to, they've started a big thing where they're anti-war and they love everybody and their sexual lives have become freer. The kids are looking for something else, some different moral value, because they know they're gonna get all the things that were thought impossible 50 years ago. And the whole sort of basis of society and values which were accepted could be changed, but it's up to them to carry os those ideals that they had instead of just falling into the same old routine their parents have fallen into. So it's not until the people of 21 now reach the age of 75. Those kids actually have to be grandfathers before the whole thing is changed. ♪ (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction♪ We want Mick!

Has there ever been a time in the crowds and getting into theaters and away from them that you've really had the wind up your sails os occasion, that you really were going to be cut off from, you know, get caught in the crowd, virtually? - Last night was bad. - Last night's a good example. Was last night your worst experience? No, no, no, no. But it was pretty bad 'cause we all got pulled down at one stage or another. What was your worst? I think probably Long Beach. Long Beach, California. There were about 5,000 people around the car. The roof of the car was pushed in. There were police everywhere, there were about two policemen injured, and all sorts of dogs, and the car was wrecked. And we just about -- We had a helicopter waiting for us to take us to a TV show, and we just about got away in time. That was very dangerous. We knocked a policeman off his bike. - That was great! - Broke his leg or something. Yeah, he was very cool, wasn't he? He was very cool os his bike. - Until we ran into him. - Great, with guns flying everywhere. How many times have you done that with your coat? About 50, I suppose. You do it very well yourself.

There's a difference between acting and sort of get-- You sort of have to define acting. I mean, you could say that people in a club dancing or people in a dance hall dancing, you could ask, "Are they acting?" 'Cause they are. There's a difference between acting and not enjoying it and acting and just doing it the way you want to do. It's like getting into a part. Say you're doing a play. You just act it or really you get inside it. The most successful entertainers have always been the most egotistical ones onstage.

On the next house, we'll turn the screaming down. But did you enjoy the overall effect of it? On the whole, they're quite a good effect. It's the people themselves, I think, cause any immoral effect, it turns out. It's nothing to do with the Stones themselves as far as I'm concerned. But the Stones themselves I think are good artists. Better that they got all their high spirits out at the cinema watching an act. As long as they don't damage the cinema or the Stones. Right. I'll second that. Onstage, I suppose there's a sexual thing between the audience and the group. As far as lyrics go, sex doesn't play as important part as is generally believed.
