Why don't you clean it up sometime? Hey. I'm workin' on a new song here, I need your help. It's called Van Gogh's Ear. - Oh, a love song. - Yes, sort of. See, when Van Gogh cut off his ear, he was demonstrating the commitment you have to have if you wanna be an artist. You have to be willing to send, to cut off your ear and send it to a whore. - So, it's more than a love song. - I need to run, listen. ♫ When I think of Van Gogh's ear ♫ I know I don't have to fear ♫ Painted in the blood you read ♫ Just one ear is all you need Fuck. - Try this. Now I can hear with Van Gogh's ear. - That is it. That's the line. - Now you think we can work together on it? - Yes, that's profound, thank you. - Well, let's work on it.

What are you doing? - I thought you called me. You didn't call me? - I don't even know you. - I guess you don't know me. Let me introduce myself. My name is Tanas. Maybe you heard of me. I'm a businessman. You got an okay act, but I think you're going nowhere. - Oh. - So, if you want to be commercial, I think I can get some money behind you. - Tanas. I have heard of you. You managed the Red Dogs for a while, right? - [Tanas] Yeah. - They had a couple gold records. Then the lead singer was killed in a car accident. His girlfriend's head was severed or something? - That's a painful memory for me. - I heard they were trying to get out of their contract. - I never heard that story. - Well, I'm not sure we're ready for a big-time manager like you, Mr. Tanas. Maybe we should go it alone for a while. What do you think? - You don't want success, do you Lemmy? You just wanna hang around going nowhere. There's still time, Lemmy. There's still time left to make a deal. You can find me at the Bar Sinister. You know where that is. - I know where that is. - Tanas, I don't understand why you want to get involved with this rock and roller. Do you really think he's gonna be commercial? - You didn't hear his music. This is Satan's son, the devil's child. I'm gonna show him exactly what that means. See, I take this shit personally. - Well, alright, let's fuck him up. - No. Let's let him fuck himself up. (alarm beeping) (slow bluesy music) - Poor Joe Green. It's horrible. Who would want to do such a thing? (clears throat) - Mrs. Jones, it's apparently just a random drive-by shooting, mindless violence by those, by those gangs, the youth. - Just doesn't make sense. Weren't you involved in some kind of business deal with him? - No, no, no, not really. Well, I think we better be going. (somber organ music) - They did a good job on him. He looks better now than he did when he was alive. Don't you think, Mel? - Yeah, yeah, they did a good job on him. - You better hope they do just as good a job on you when your time comes. (drumsticks tapping) - Why are you guys not inside setting up? - We're locked out, man. They say we owe 'em too much money. - They can't do this. That's months of work. That's all the tapes we have. We were just starting to get good. People were coming to hear us. They cannot do this. - Well, they're gonna do it, man. - You're the only one with a job. You think you can handle it? - No, not this time, it's too much. - They got all the demo tapes, too, and they're threatening to erase them and reuse the stock. - We're fucked, man. - Yeah, fuck.

Fuck it's the ace factor? - I'm looking for Tanas. - So what? - Well, he said I could meet him here. I'm supposed to meet him. That door says, "Keep out." - Don't go through there. Forget this place. - Ptoo! (slow jazzy music) - Lemmy. Come on down. I heard someone was looking for me. This is a pleasant surprise. Please sit. I can see from looking at you that you're ready to talk business. Excellent. - [Woman] Sick! Sick! - What's the matter, babe? This is art. - Hey, Duke. Can't you see we're trying to transact business here? - She's flippin' out. - Give her her clothes. Give her her clothes. Excuse me, Lemmy. Don't mind the distraction. - [Woman] Pervert! Creep! - So what is it that you want to see me about? - Uh, we wanna do it. We wanna sign with you. We need a cash advance up front, show of good faith. - This guy's a loser, Tanas. All he wants is cash. - He handles my contracts. - What are you lookin' at? - This says in exchange for worldly success, you're going to have possession of my immortal soul. - That's my standard contract. - Is it a joke? All we want is a manager. If you can get some money behind us, I mean, get us out of debt, maybe get us some gigs, buy us some studio time, then we'll give you 10 percent. - I should've known. I get 15 percent and expenses off the top. - But this is just a management deal, right? None of this immortal soul jazz. - No, that was just a little joke. - Well, Tanas, I don't know what your trip, I don't care what your trip is if you can just get behind us, give us some positive direction, that's all that matters, yes? - You're in good hands, Lemmy. Let's shake on it. - Don't we uh, don't we need to sign something? - Uh, not for this one. Handshake's good enough for me. We can always close that other deal later. Of course, you and I don't believe in anything so medieval as an immortal soul, do we? But actually, between you and me, I doubt that any of this immortal soul stuff is even legal. Hey Lemmy. You mind goin' out that way, please? He's a fuckin' asshole. (tense music) - Jimmy, don't go out to the pool. Come on, can't out to the pool now. Come on, it's too late for that. There ya go, let's get you off and I know you don't wanna go to bed. Come on, let's go. (banging) Just what are you people doing here? I told you never to come around my house. That's my family in there. - Shut up, Mr. Jones. We gotta talk, Jonesey. Mr. Tanas is very concerned about the money. You've been a bad boy, Mr. Jones. Remember Joe Green? My friend Joe Green was a bad boy, too. - We're very concerned about the money, Mr. Jones. We're worried to fuckin' death. (ominous music) - Who were those strange people? - It was nothing. Just a bunch of weirdos, nobody. - But those men were at the funeral home. What are you mixed up in? - I'm involved in a deal and I expect to make a lot of money. - You're in a deal with them? Well, who on Earth are they? - They hang around this place, it's a bar, called the Bar Sinister. Guess they give these matches out as calling cards. Anyway, they're just, some sort of an association. They all seem to be working for the same person. The point is, they don't keep very good records, and in this sort of deals, a lot of money can fall through the cracks and I uh, I got my hands on some of that money. - Wasn't Joe Green involved in this before, before he got murdered? - Yeah, but, perhaps, sort of, but I don't think that his death was any way... - You were insane to do this. You're jeopardizing your family. I'm going to the police. - No, no, no, Sal, look, you can't do that. These guys, they own the police. But don't worry, alright? They're inefficient and that's my edge. We are going to be very rich. Sal, I did all this for you. (engine rumbling) (thudding) (groaning) - What the fuck's the matter with you? What the hell are you doing? - Just trying to get you in a conversational mood. - Man, I've got nothing to hide. - Where's our money? - Man, don't you know anything? Jones has got the money, Jones has... - [Spike] What'd you say, what'd you say? - Jones has got the money. - Why does Jones have the money? - Fuck, you're so stupid, man he... - [Spike] What? What did you say? - Jesus, he's the one who set up the whole deal. He's the one who's got the money and got the import finances. Once the dope was sold, then we had to pay off the investors. Now it's all tied up in some off-shore banking thing, I don't know. - Bullshit. - Hey, it's not bullshit, man. It's the truth, man, I'm telling the tr... Hey, that's my tailor. Can we stop over there? I got a real rip in my pants. What the fuck? It's true! Man, I got a rip in my pants, man. What do you want? Look, I want you guys to have the money. I mean, I really do and that'd be the best thing that could ever happen, but, man, it's all tied up in this banking thing. - Those bankers, a bunch of fucking crooks. (tires squealing) - Take a hike, Mel. - Man, I told ya everything I know. Jones is the guy you want. Jones is the guy you gotta deal with. - You've been very helpful and thank you, but get lost. Take a hike, Mel! (thudding) (groaning) - Bye, Mel. (rock music) (blasting) - Hey, what is that shit? - Sodium tetrachloride. Industrial solvent. - That stuff any good for ya? - You shittin' me? The stuff's toxic. Burns right through your liver. - Hey, where you goin'? We just came over to hear the tapes. Tanas got some ideas. - The engineer can play it back for you. We're leaving. Got a gig tomorrow night. - No, I think I'll stay. I'd like to hear 'em again. - Lemmy. These guys are fucked up. Let's leave.

You let loose a bunch of birds during one of your songs and just when everybody thinks it's some sort of hippie-dippie, love peace sort of thing, you take one of the birds, the dove would be nice, and you bite its head off. - You're fucking kiddin' me, right? - Well, think about it. It sure would liven up the act. - Lemmy. You should listen to Spike. - I don't know, man. - You gotta be open to new ideas, Lemmy. But don't forget, in a purely business sense, we own you. (punk music) - [Woman] Come on, lemme sleep man! - Go inside, they got beds inside. You can sleep there. - [Woman] I don't wanna go in there. - What are you doing after the show, Lemmy? Wanna come over to my place? Got a tape of Blow Up, have you seen it? - Yeah, I mean, I'd like that. Um, Tanas is having a little party after the show. I thought maybe we could go there. - Lemmy, that guy is a creep. I don't even know why we have to mess around with him in the first place. - That guy got us all the studio time we want. That guy gave us our freedom. - Lemmy, there's something wrong with this whole thing. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute. Now, all the things that we wanted, all the things that were just out of our grasp, our freedom, our money, studio time, rehearsal time... - [Angel] Lemmy, the guy is a jerk! - No, no, no, wait, listen to me, listen to me. Are you listening to me? Studio time, money, rehearsal time, exposure, you understand me? I can't go on, I can't go on. I can't go on. - Would you be serious? Cut it out... - All that stuff that... - [Angel] What is wrong with you, Lemmy? - It's because of him. It's within our grasp, now. We can get all that stuff. Tanas did that. - The guy is an asshole! Come on, Lemmy. - Yeah, say yeah. Say yeah. I'm so glad to be back on. - You're not even listening. - And what's your suggestion? - Look, just come over to my place, Lemmy. Forget him! Just come over to my place, please? - Let's go the party for a little while and then go to your place. (heels clacking) - You guys 'bout ready to go on? - I can't go on.

We wanna know. - The more blood, the more you can engage that certain je ne sais quoi that really makes a performance happen. There's somebody I want you to meet. - Ah! - Or maybe, maybe it's an ontological problem. - Lemmy, this is Mabel. - Michelle. - I'm sorry Michelle. - Michelle, Lemmy is a musician. Do you remember the Beatles? - No, I don't know them. - Well, Lemmy is going to be as important as the Beatles. - Okay, so the problem is not what can I be? But more properly stated the question should be how can I be? - Lemmy loves and desires you, Michelle, because you are beautiful, because you are perfect. - Action is the fact. Existence is the result. (rock music) That's the name of the game, being, not knowing. That's the false game. - If you really wanna see your mind, you gotta be ready to rip your skull open. - What'd he say? To see your mind you gotta split open your head? That's good. That's something I could've said. (rock music) (siren blaring) - What did you give me? - I think I might've had too much of that shit. (bottle crashes) - What the fuck were doing rolling around the floor with that girl like that? - It didn't mean anything. Don't you get it? - No, I don't get it. - It's like the ear, Van Gogh's ear, you see? - I get the whore part, I don't get the ear part. - Listen to the man's ear. Van Gogh's, he cut off a man's ear. - No, I don't get the ear! Fuck the ear! - You gotta be crazy. - Fuck you. - Hey, hey, hey, no. I love you so much. - You're fuckin' nuts! - I wanna be. I wanna be fuckin' nuts. (sexy jazz music) - Are you gonna do your vocals this time? Do you know how to count? One, two, three. Yeah, can you do it? (punk music) - One, um... Can you guys, like, leave so I can, so I can concentrate? Fuckin' split so I can concentrate, man. - Are we still a band or are we just sidemen now? What you're drinking cough syrup now? What the fuck is wrong with you? - I have a cold. (crashes) - What's wrong with Angel? She's more fucked up than you are. What'd you do to her? - What'd I... I didn't do anything to her. She's got her own free will. What she does, she does to herself. (thudding) Look, I made the deal, why are you... Would you just go on so we can concen... I, I, I love you guys. You know that, right? Excuse me. I fuckin' love you guys. I couldn't do it without you. You know that, but I'm, I'm self-conscious today. - Look at her. She's totally fucked up. - She's a little bit tired. We were out real late last night. It's okay. Come on, bye bye. It's okay. Bye bye, kiss kiss. Angel. No, come here, come on. Okay? Okay, (mumbling) Okay, roll it. (crashing) - Hey you guys, you can't bring those guns in here. Mr. Stalag wouldn't approve of that. - What are you gonna do about it? - Just don't bring those fucking guns in here. - Whoa. Lemme see (mumbles) those fuckin' bullets. (blasting) Whoo! (slurping) (tense music) - Hey, Lemmy. You gonna eat that burger or wear it? You're gonna wear it. - Looks like bright boy's been hitting a little heavy on the Robitussin. (drum beating) - Come on, Einstein, let's go. (phone ringing) - Hello? - [Spike On Phone] Hello, Mr. Jones. - Who is this? Who is this? - [Spike On Phone] It's your creditors, that's who. Where's our hundred thousand? - Look, you're gonna have to take that up with Mel. - [Spike On Phone] I can't take it up with Mel. That fucking guy's dead. - What? - Yeah, no shit. This guy's a panic. Look, you get us the money by tomorrow, or we'll kill ya. We'll kill your family, the whole thing. Goodbye. - Hello? (tense music) (phone ringing) - Oh he's making a phone call. Let's listen in. - Mrs. Jones, please. Hi honey, it's me. Look, I want you to listen to me carefully. I'm having a little more trouble than I expected. Yeah, it's about that deal. Look, don't panic, just listen to me. In our safe deposit box, there's a passbook for a numbered account in the Cayman Islands. Now, there's over a couple hundred thousand dollars in that account, now, if I'm not around, or if anything should happen to me, I want you to take that money... (clicks) Hello? Hello? Sal? (tense music) - What are you trying to do? You're a fuck up, Jones. (baby crying) Why don't you just give us the money? Look at your little boy. - You're not a very good father. It's way past his bedtime. - Let go of him. - Hey, hey. (baby screaming) - You have done something wrong. You've betrayed a trust, and I believe that when somebody does something wrong, they should be punished. Duke, do you agree? - [Duke] Huh? - Do you agree with me that people that do something wrong should be punished? - Yeah, sure. Why the fuck not? - It would appear to be self-evident, but Mr. Jones thinks otherwise. Mr. Jones believes that anything goes. He is amoral. You know what that means Duke. - Huh? - He thinks he's beyond good and evil. But I gotta tell you something Mr. Jones, you are fucked! You are in error. (blasting) (splashing) (tense music) (tires squealing) (gasping) - Oh my, oh my god. (screaming) Jimmy! Oh my god! Jimmy! Oh my god, Jimmy! Jimmy, Jimmy! (tense music) (wretching) - Did you have to kill the guy? - What the fuck were we supposed to do? He was trying to rip us off. Big fuckin' deal. - Don't try to separate yourself from this. You were there. Where do you think we get the money to buy your studio time? - Fuckin' A jack. Violence makes the world go 'round. Get into it, man. (tense music) - Hey. Wake up. These people are fuckin' maniacs. They just killed a guy. - Where the fuck are we? - Did you hear what I said? They blew his brains out. Angel! They blew a guy's brains out. - You've got blood and puke all over your shirt. What happened to you? You probably pissed your goddamn pants, too! - You don't even care that they killed this guy? - Hey, I didn't do it. You're the one that was there, not me. What are you trying to do to me? (thudding) Fucker! (chattering on police radio) - This is your gun or at least it was registered to your husband but we don't think it was used in the crime. - No, the gun is okay. See, parts of his skull and his brain tissue were scattered around the pool area but the larger portion of his cranial mass was left in tact, which tells us that that was a small caliber weapon. In fact, we found nine millimeter bullets. Thank you. Yeah, if it had been that gun, which is a 44 caliber, his head would have exploded like a ripe cantaloupe. - Hey, take it easy. Have some respect. - Oh, I'm sorry. Things get abstract, I lost touch. Please forgive me. - As soon as you hear from the kidnappers, give us a call. I don't think you'll be hearing from them real soon, but uh, I do think your boy's probably alright. Do you have a match? Oh, nevermind, I got one. Look, call me anytime, even if you just wanna talk. I know this is a, a terrible, horrible time for you, but it's the time when your faith in God can pull you through. - I was trapped. I was being manipulated like a herky-jerky puppet. I was, fate was pulling my strings. I was being told what to do. (smacking) (mumbling) - Angel! - Is that what you want? You wanna be loved? (tense music) - Hey Lemmy, what's the matter? - My head is fucked up. I have to straighten it out. - What for? Why do you wanna stop now? You wanna go back to the insurance company? There's nothing for you, there. That's slow death, man. The path of excess leads to the powerful wisdom. It's your choice, man. (train bell dinging) - I mean, it's 3:30 now. Do you have any idea when he's coming? - I don't know, how would I know? - Just figured you might know, is all. - Well, I don't. - I guess you don't, then. - Hey, hey, guys. Look, look, we're doing Hellbound Train, okay, and a hole opens up in the ceiling and Angel comes down hanging from a rope, and she's wearing a chain, like a dog, you know? And she gets down and Lemmy's leading her around the stage. Lemmy's being a real bad guy. He's being very decadent and this is a, this is a persona, huh? But then the tables are turned. Lemmy gets his come-uppance and he's in the dog collar. Angel gets him in it and he has to, there's this big scaffold of amplifiers and Lemmy is taken to the very top and then the rope comes down again. The same one like Angel was on, but this time there's a noose and Lemmy sticks his head through there and he keeps singing 'cause the band is still cranking this song on the stage. Wouldn't that be a kick to have a fat lady on the stage playing a tuba? Now, where the fuck was I? - The news? You're in the news? - I was in the news. I was in the fucking news? The news, wow. Fuck me. - How 'bout this? You puke in your shoes, then you put your shoes on your hands and then you crawl across the stage. - I get it. You guys are being facetious. - [Man] Hey, jump up your ass. (tense music) Get drunk and be somebody, brother. (uptempo music) - Oh, yeah. Anything you want, I got it. Come on in here, man. Oh, yeah. Super mondo disco nexus. - What the fuck is this noise? - Hey I bet I know what you wanna hear, man. I can play... (crashing) Man, what do you think you're doing?

Authorities still don't know the cause, but the fire is now almost under control. Now here at KX100, the hits just keep on coming. - Can I sit here? Uh, I'm wondering if you could help me? I'm in a bit of trouble. - Sure. Trouble is my middle name. - It's my car. It's just outside and there's something wrong with it. I was wondering, maybe you could listen to it and see if you could tell what's wrong. I'm, I'm just so helpless. It's this car right over here. I'll just start it, and see what you think. (engine stalling) So what do you think? - I know what's wrong. The thing won't start. - Uh, boy I really, I really am in a jam. (engine stalling) If I could just get to my motel. I have some traveler's checks. And I could get the car fixed. - Well, maybe I could give you a ride. - Oh, could you? That would be great. It's right down the street. (uptempo beat music) (crashing) - Hey, what the fuck are you guys doing? I didn't write that. - We're trying something out. We gotta check with you before we tune up? - Well, who do you think you are? You guys are the unlimited (mumbles) orchestra as far as... - Don't point that gun at me. - Orchestra as far as I'm concerned. - Are you ready to do the vocals now? - Yeah, man, I'm ready. - You realize you missed 'em the last two times? - Well, the last two times you, like, took me by surprise. (rock music) (blasting) - What the fuck? That kills it, I'm outta here. - Wait, where you going? That's gonna sound great. What the fuck is the matter with him? - Maybe he's got a low tolerance for gunfire. (sexy jazzy music) - Okay, it's this motel right over here. (sexy jazzy music) It's right up here. I'll be right back. (tense music) Purse. Oh God. Purse. - You looking for something? - Um, my purse, I left it here on this chair. - Put it on. The hat. - No, I think it's too big. - Put it on. - No, no, that's... - I said put it on! Looks good. It's right here, on the bed next to me. - I just need to get my lipstick out and just... Hold it right there! - Oh, I never seen a lipstick case that looks like that! - Don't try anything. Don't move, don't try anything. Don... - You must think I'm like a fucking moron or something. Oh, I'm so helpless.

Give me my boy. - I'm your boy. - I want my son! - I'm your son mama, here I come! (blasting) (thudding) - Oh. Oh, god. (jazzy music) - It's that bitch. She split. - Looks like he was beatin' the bishop at the moment of his demise. - Well, at least he died happy. - I hope she's a pretty girl. Hey, room 10. I got a hot date. What, I came all this way to fuck a dead guy? - Now, wait a minute. - [Jane] Do you have any idea what you're doing anymore? - I can't stop. I have to go. I'm going straight to the heart of darkness. - You're completely out of it, man. Your feet aren't even on the ground anymore. - Look what you've done to her. - [Lemmy] She does it to herself. - Are you coming, Jane? - I'm not leaving. If I leave her alone with him, next time we see her, she's gonna be dead. - Some chick blew Duke away. I guess she lured him there. I don't know why. - We gotta do something about the kid. He cries all the time. - I cry all the time. - What do you want us to do? - Get rid of the kid. - What do you mean? - Take the kid, put him in the car and you push it off the cliff. - What about the money Jones owes us? - Who gives a fuck? - Where you goin'? What's the matter with him? - I don't know. Okay, man, get the kid. - Me? - Yeah, you. Who the fuck else? (chime music) - I have great, wild visions and concepts in my head, and I can never remember 'em. - Yeah, you're too fucked up. - That is true. Everything has its price. - You makin' fun of me? Don't make fun of me. - What are you talkin' about? - Don't make fun of me! - Nobody's making fun of you. Will you, don't do that, okay? Would you, would you put that down? Angel, Angel, Angel, here, here, here. - It's okay. It's okay, baby. - Come on, come on, come on. - It's okay. - [Lemmy] Come here. - Everything's gonna be okay. - Angel, Angel. That a girl. (crying) No, no, no, come here. (tense music) (crying) Maybe I, maybe I came this whole way looking for you. (baby crying) (tense beat music) - Get up against the wall. - Looks like you've got something on your mind. - That's my boy's. - That's my elephant, but you can have it. - You tell me where my boy is. - How should I know? - I wanna know where my son is! - There's a saying, "Those who the angels love best die young." - Kid's alright. He's at the studio. - What studio? Where? - Starlight Studio, over on West. - What the fuck is wrong with you? - It's over, man. Can't ya see that? Tanas is sick. He doesn't even care about the money anymore. He's dying and he wants everyone else to die. You can stay with the sick man, but I've had it, I'm cashin' in. (crashing) (dramatic music) - [Spike] You're fucking dead, man. - Hah, what's he doin' here? - Search me, some guy dropped him off. Friend of yours. - This child is a reminder to us that life replenishes itself. But he doesn't belong here. We have to do something about this. Okay. It's gonna be alright. I'm gonna take care of this. Yes, the time has come for me to straighten this mess out. ("Daytripper", Beatles) (ominous music) - Hey, hey. (whistling) Hey, hey. I brought ya a new boyfriend. - Ah! - Give us a big kiss. (thudding) (ominous music) Hey, hey! Turn me on, dead man. - Hiya, Sally. I'm death. You hate me now, Sally, but you'll love me later. (tense music) (engine puttering) (rock music) What's up, Lemmy? You want a game? - That kid's down at the studio, the one you kidnapped! You gotta let him go. - The kid doesn't even matter anymore. I got something better. I got the kid's mom. She's tied up in the other room. We're gonna kill her, and we're gonna videotape it. You can get 20, 30 thousand per tape for shit like that. This video tape revolution, it's a gold mine. - Oh, you're sick. You're fucked up, you're fucking crazy! - You sure you don't want a game? I'll give you white. - I'm gonna set her free, and I'm gonna let the kid go. Ah! I feel like I been sleeping, I'm just now waking up. - If you're waking up you're dreaming, man. You're already guilty of murder and kidnapping. Can't you see what's happening? You're going around the bend. First, you wanna be the bad guy and then you wanna be the good guy. You don't know what you're doing. But it's okay. It's okay. 'Cause it's all the same. It's all the same fucked up-ness. But it's cool, man. Go with it. - No, I'm gonna do this, so don't screw with me. - I'm trembling. (thudding) I'm shaking. (jazzy music) See ya later, Lemmy. (engine rumbling) - You sure like to mix it up, Tanas, don't you? - Queen's gambit. - Queen's gambit? - Chess move. I used my queen to get his queen. ♫ Hush little baby ♫ Don't say a word ♫ Mama's gonna buy you a... (tense music) (creaking) - Jimmy. (baby crying) (blasting) - Stop it, what are doing? - Please, I wanna help her. (mumbling) she tried to kill me. She's trying to kill me goddammit! - Baby, stop, stop it, there's no one there. Come on, we'll go look. Calm down, we'll go look. (baby crying) See? It's okay. Now, give me the gun. (blasting) (dramatic music) - Angel. No! (blasting) (screaming) - You're dead. You won't get away with this. (moaning) (baby crying) - Everything's gonna be okay. You're gonna be alright. (tense music) Okay, okay. I realize now. Are you okay? (moaning) I'll get you to a hospital. Please don't die, Angel. Please don't die! Come on. (tense music) I'm sorry. I'm so fucking sorry. I blew it. (uptempo rock music) (sirens blaring) Ah! - [Cop] Hold it right there! Stop or I'll shoot! - Ah! (thudding) (blasting) - [Cop] She's dead. (tense music) (sirens blaring) (helicopter whirring) - I'm not sure, she should be here just momentarily. Oh, and here is our artist today, our lecturer, our speaker, a man who needs no further introduction. (clapping) (tense music) - Some, some, some of you might be wondering why I appear before you in such attire. The subject I would really like to address tonight is faith. (chatter on police radio) A man may be repeatedly called upon to make what the philosophers call a leap of faith. It looks very much like this. Ah! (crashing) (clapping) (clinking) (engine rumbling) (sirens blaring) (slow punk music) ♫ I'm the devil's child (groaning) ♫ I'm the ♫ Devil's child ♫ Yes, I'm ♫ Satan's son. (blasting) (gasping) (chatter on police radio) - This guy's a goner. We supposed to take him to the hospital or the morgue? - Long as there's life in him, you take him to the hospital. (engine rumbling) (sirens blaring) - This guy's so full of holes if he took a drink of water, he'd leak all over the place. - There's no way he'll pull through? - Him? Not a chance. Hey, what are we stoppin' here for? - Get out right now. Hi Lemmy. How's it goin'? You don't look too good. - You pissed me off, Lemmy. All of that phony Satan shit, that false devil worship. If people don't believe in me, I don't exist. You took my name in vain. - I got something for you to sign, Lemmy. Look familiar? - This is it, Lemmy. You're a dying man, but I can give you back your life. And what about the girl, Lemmy? What about Angel? She doesn't deserve it. You do, but she doesn't. So, I'll tell ya what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna give you two lives for one soul. Your life and her life for your soul. - Okay, man, you ready to sign this? You can just mark an 'X'. Let's forget that. How 'bout a thumbprint? Yeah, that's good. You even got it in blood. Of course, things won't be exactly the same. I mean, they will change a bit. You'll still be able to perform, but you'll be playing different venues. (slow rock music) - Hey, relax. Let's talk this over. - what do you have to talk about? - You've got the wrong guy. I'm just the flunky. Let me explain this to you. It's Tanas, he did all this shit just to get that kid, Lemmy. Tanas hates that kid. I didn't want to kill your husband, kidnap that little boy. I love kids. Tanas made me do it. He's the puppetmaster, I just dance when he pulls the strings. You and me, we're just pawns in the game. Evil is contagious. It's got you infected. You killed that chick and Duke. I bet that you got Lemmy, too. Isn't that enough bloodletting? Give me the gun. I'll get rid of it for you. Let's end all this. (clicking) Say goodnight Sally. (clicking) - I learned that from a friend of yours. - No, no, no, no! (blasting) (crashing) (melancholy music) (ominous music) - Hi Sally. I'm Tanas. You did a real good job. - How good? This good? (blasting) This good? (blasting) This good Tanas? (blasting) (somber music) I'll see you in hell, Sally.
