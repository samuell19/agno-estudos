THREE MONTHS LATER... Repeat the name, just the name! Volpone! Know him, boss? I've heard of him. What do we do? Ante up. Hi, Commissioner. I got nobody waitin' for me - That's it. - I got it. I been here a long time I got nobody... - Mr. Siffredi? - He's in the balcony. Thanks. Excuse me. I been here a long time I got nobody waitin'for me Lovers are passers-by to me To have me, just say the word Sailor boy, take me with you I hate my memories I spend my life lying If leaving is a bit like dying Then long live the ships and the sea Sailor boy, take me with you Like it? Nice business, Mr. Siffredi. If only Capella could've seen this. It was his idea. Speaking of your friend, I imagine you've been doing research too. - To no avail. - Really? Your police are better than mine. And often the same. They fished out an Italian today, beat to a pulp. Really? More and more Italians doing business in Marseilles. What businesses? All sorts. You know Giovanni Volpone? Heard the name. He's got a reputation. Isn't exactly empty-handed. He's a serious competitor. Why tell me? So you'll be careful. If you fall, I won't be there to catch you. You know me. I only watch and keep score. That's all... I can do. News, boss. We found him. - Where is he? - On the train from Paris. Francesco Volpone? Yes. Surprised to see me? I don't know you. Siffredi. Roch Siffredi. Francois Capella's associate. He was like a brother to me. You killed him. You'll get off here. You can't do this! My brother's waiting for me! I'll say hi for you. You'll pay for this! I don't think you know Mr. Volpone. Giovanni Volpone. You were on the train with my brother. I'm here to pick him up. See him? He didn't jump off. Who knows? Excuse me. Business calls. Yes, Fernand. It's war. A glass of champagne. The best house in France. They say Siffredi spent more than a million on this place. These are sacred spots. The ones in Paris were founded by St. Louis. Go on. There you go. Happy birthday. Will we be happy one day? Maybe... Sure. Happy birthday, Lola. You're crazy. Francois promised it to you. I haven't much to offer you It's four francs for a sigh But if you want to make me happy Don't forget my present, baby Sailor boy, take me with you After so long I've got nothing left I've left everything behind Mr. Siffredi. My heart and my youth All I had of value I'm from here and anywhere I lost my heart somewhere The dream ofhappiness I keep Is to sail away across the deep Sailor boy, take me with you And now, straight from Paris, the new joy of the Alcazar, the king of comics, Charly. Good evening, ladies, gentlemen and the others. Mr. Siffredi. Madame Lola phoned for you to come at once. There's trouble. My hat and coat. For my opening number... Good crowd tonight. I'll recite you... I'll recite a little poem by Victor Hugo. - What do we do? - I'll be back. Where's Lola? Remember Solange from Paris? She had a client. A crazy nut. What happened? I've done all I can. Two shots of morphine. She's not suffering for now. Acid. If she lives, she'll be blind and scarred for life. - Who was it? - He ran off across the rooftops. Lock up. I'll send Luke over to stay with you. Don't be afraid. Spada? Gimme. Lola's car? - It's on Rue des Dames. - To the club. See you at the Alcazar in an hour. I was at the Alcazar. They killed three of my guys and hit a gal with acid at Lola's. Your club's destroyed. They didn't miss a trick. Who's Volpone? Unlimited cash, backing from the extreme right in Paris, international businessman. You better stop him at once, or I'll do it myself. Do what you want, but I'm warning you. You're not out of the woods yet. We found the body of Volpone's brother by the tracks. Everyone's leaving. A bad sign. The world turns quickly, Mr. Siffredi. Too quick for loners. Where you going? On a trip. I was dismissed an hour ago. Sir, it's 1:00 a. m. The office is closed. This is my successor, Commissioner Cazenave. Mr. Siffredi. If you have any troubles, we'll be open at 9:00 a. m. Excuse me. I hope you have fun. Where you going? The Alcazar. You shouldn't. Tonight, there will be neither police nor justice in this town. Leave. Come back later. Sorry. I'm staying. Don't shoot! I want him alive. Hurry up. What do we do, boss? Take him for a walk. Sam? I came to this city with great hopes. You and Capella were nothing more than a pair of gangsters whose time was up. Capella's death was a warning. You misunderstood it. Your vendetta's old-fashioned. Killing my brother was a mistake. You've forced me to resort to your methods, and I know how. I trust you realize that. Anything to say? Kill me fast. That would be absurd. We've decided to purify this city. With police help, we'll discredit the underworld. You'll be an example. To work. CLOSED The commissioner will see you. What do you want now? Same as always. You really do love your boss. Asking the police to find him. He can't disappear like that. Things happen. But I'll find him. I've been ordered to. For me, nothing's ever really lost. Nothing! One more. No, I've got orders. No more credit. Just one. Nobody's gonna slam the till on my fingers. Roch. Eat, or ya won't last. I'd do anything for Roch Siffredi. Don't forget. I pass by here every three weeks. Thanks, I'll remember. We want work! Commissioner Cazenave is sick of seeing you. Eleven times in two months. Where are you taking me? To answer the questions you keep asking the cops. I got good news for you. Siffredi, who you whine after like a lost puppy... He's back. What'll I do, boss? Plow through 'em. - I'll hit 'em. - So what? Go see him. Boss. What've they done to ya? Another. Can ya pay? Get out. - Come with me. - Screw off. Boss, don't ya recognize me? He doesn't understand a thing. I'll pay. Leave the bottle. Just a minute. Be nice to this poor guy who's been so worried about you. Where you been? We found him wandering around the docks this morning. Ask nicely. Please... - Stop serving him. - Shut up. You can't. He's used to 10 bottles a day. Right this way, gentlemen. Come on. Get some good pictures. There. What a show. Step back. One more with the bottle. That tastes good. Stop! He's gone raving mad! He's hit his pal! It's getting bad. Call the police. "Siffredi Stricken With Insanity. " "The Downfall of Roch Siffredi. " An excellent example. And it's not over. STATE INSANE ASYLUM We want food! We want food! I'm leaving. Let me out! I'm not crazy! Doing okay? You okay, Roch? Three months on water's done you good. You look more calm. You know I'm not crazy. Nobody here is. They're just ill. Volpone owns the head doctor. Who'd believe that? The director wants you at Mass. Coming. They often die in here. Our task is almost finished. Law and order reign in Marseilles. Men are waging the same fight throughout the West. But Mr. Volpone, why Marseilles? Yes, why Marseilles? This town is the world's top market for our secret weapon. A white weapon, heroin. It'll put the decadent society on its knees. Henceforth, politics must reckon with chemistry. By drugging the sons, we catch the fathers. In Berlin, a new order is growing and taking form. A new world is coming that will dominate Europe! Here, if we do a good job... one day... our friends will take over without a shot fired. Fernand. Here are the measurements. Three coffins. They're good clients. Make a 4th. I got coffins to deliver. - They harmless? - They're not dangerous. Only three for you. You and you. Put it over there. Soup's on. Go on. This one's not for you. What is it? Sir, Siffredi escaped from the asylum. When? How? This afternoon in an empty coffin. Pretty smart guy. I underrated him. Who helped? Fernand. He prepared for six months by working for the asylum's carpenter, Commissioner Cazenave. Yeah, of the police. Commissioner? Roch Siffredi has escaped. Oh, you know it? Will you help me catch him? Get him and hand him over. It won't be easy. There are laws. Laws are for the poor. Where we going? Genoa. Seen Lola? - Where from? - Dusseldorf. Where to? Malaga. I'm glad to see that "Charity & Progress" has so many brave and devoted women with a sense of duty. I'm proud to award them their Diplomas of Public Service. Gentlemen. Nobody's lived in it for 20 years. But like Siffredi said, "In town, discreet, and no neighbors. " It feels odd to come home. When I was a kid, Marseilles meant easy living. Today I'm bringing back anger. - Everything okay? - Just fine. You guys on vacation? We're just killing a little time. Before he dies, he's gonna lose all this. There are ghosts in the night trains They smile at us as we cross the plains The night train is a domain With Paris at the end of the line Such tender memories Make themselves heard I hear an enchanting voice Singing in the depths of my heart I hear a ship's sad call And the song of a bird The sky is filled with white sheep The rolling sea troubles my sleep The city says good night to me And the station says farewell You meant what you said in Italy? What? You no longer like Marseilles. I've got nothing more to do here. Just a couple of things to settle. Maybe Volpone was right. It'll never be as before. Thinking of Lola? Yes, Fernand. I am. Liliane, room three. Lola, room eight. End of the hall on the right. What's your name? Luciano. You're Lola? You seem nice. Mr. Siffredi is back. - Roch? - Yes, Roch Siffredi. She's there. I saw her. Alone? Yes, I told her you're back. She cried. She said three clients per floor, the girls, the doorman... and six armed card-players. Volpone's men. Another. Later. Wait. It's me again. Quite a guy. It's over, Lola. Let's go. So sorry, I had mechanical troubles. My apologies, Consul, and thank you for coming. The honor's mine, Mr. Volpone. To your health. I don't know. For example, my... It must be him! He's back, and all over the place! He's dangerous to us both. I'll be there in 15 minutes. - The file, sir. - Later. What do we do? Three dead in a shoot-out, a casino burned down. - The chief wants you to call. - Tomorrow. - But, sir... - Tomorrow. GANG WAR HITS MARSEILLES AGAIN I'll be back. You'll drink less than I did... but I hope your livers are in good shape. Continue. They won't show up. They're all afraid. Yellow dogs all of'em. They'll pay. Sam and Cazenave are at the Marine Bar. Drunk. Viva Volpone! Screw the Socialists! Long live Germany! Bastard! Down with the bastards! Down with the workers! I'll teach ya to obey. Drunks! A woman's place is in the home. Why ya starin' at me? - No need to get angry, sir. - That's "commissioner"! What's all the racket? - Hey, what's this? - Uniforms. Commissioner, come on. Who says so? Been expecting you, Commissioner. The chief is waiting for you up there. Where? In your office. I don't have an office. The situation is serious. So I've read. A commissioner and a known gangster striking police officers. Will you restore law and order? Cazenave has my job. I was dismissed. I'm reinstating you. Cazenave's asked for a colonial post, Cayenne, Madagascar... doesn't matter where. Can I count on you? And your discretion? Volpone must be seen to, but carefully. Yes, sir. You'll have to set it up... so that I'm left with no choice. I think I have an answer. - I'm all ears. - Not to act. To do nothing. You think that will... It can and it will. Within three days. What the... I heard you were dead. I don't die easy. What do you want? To meet with Volpone on neutral ground. Interesting. Where? - Your office. - Well, is that all? Give me two minutes alone with him. Possible? Feasible. But if he kills you, I'll nail him. If you get him, don't count on me. - Still honest? - Yeah. Listen, Commissioner. You're wasting my time. Sorry, I can't find that testimony. Why did you send for me? It's an old case. Remember Francois Capella? Vaguely. Why? You're to see Roch Siffredi. What? From now on, it's the same law for everyone. A threat? No. You know me. I'm just doing my job. Mr. Siffredi. I think you've met. Sir, could I see you a moment? I'll be right back. You're not being reasonable. Your disorderly methods had disappeared from Marseilles. With a man like you... we could see eye to eye. Big changes are underway. But you wanted to see me. Will you say why? I will. I wanted to tell you to your face that I've come back to kill you, and I'm gonna do it soon. Why tell me? So you'll be afraid. Miss, get me 39-42. What nerve. - Sam. - Yeah? I'm at the police department. No, alone. Get the men together. Don't waste any time. - What do we do? - Wait and keep score. Where were we? Siffredi is gone? Yes, he left. Pack up. You're leaving. Without you? What about you? We're both leaving. For America. - America's so big. - So what? Let's leave at once. Impossible. I have one last detail to see to. Don't be afraid. Hurry up. Fast. Fast. Fernand. Luciano! Don't shoot. - Where's Volpone? - I don't know. Where? Leaving by train in an hour. To go where? Berlin. Call him. Why? Call. For you, sir. Mr. Siffredi. I forgot one thing. You'll die the same day as Sam. In Berlin, all will go well. I hope you'll return with better instructions. Don't worry. Time for you to go. The train's about to leave. See you soon. Is Volpone here? - What is it? - The warehouse is on fire. - And Sam... - What? They killed him. Do as I say and you'll be okay. - Tell me why... - Move! You've lost, Volpone. No regrets? I never regret anything. America's big. We don't know anyone there. I do. Oh. Champagne. Care to dance? Since when does a woman ask a man to dance? But, sir, this is 1937. True. TO BE CONTINUED...
