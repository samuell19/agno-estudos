Man: You think they have any idea? I mean, you think they know we're coming? Second man: Those people are paranoid. They figure somebody's coming. They just don't know when. I don't know. My gut says they got no idea. I hope your gut's right. Do you hear something? Do you hear them chanting or something? The freaks? I doubt it. We're a mile away. I've been having dreams about them. They've been chanting in my dreams, praying maybe. Only, in my dreams, it comes out sounding like that song you sexy thing by hot chocolate. Remember that song? You sexy thing. * I believe in miracles * * since you came along * you sexy thing * you sexy thing, you ha. Nah. Don't know that one. You think I'm crazy, don't you? Some nutty Mick from Boston. Shit gets heavy, we fall back to there. See it? The little farmhouse? That sounds like a plan, boss. Don't call me boss. You have a very closed personality, you know? Hasn't anyone ever told you that? That's my job. Your job, too, only you don't know it yet. Yeah, ok. Then I guess it's pointless to ask if you want to go get a beer. Tomorrow's a big day. You should try to get some sleep. Oh, forget it. I'm too jumpy. I'll watch letterman. My sister sent me this great videotape of hockey highlights. It's unbelievable. Bobby orr from beginning to end. It's... You're joking, right? You like hockey? It's--it's--it's-- it's out of this world. "It's orr. It's orr! "He shoots! He scores!" It's really good. See you in a couple of hours, Irish. Bama. If shit does get heavy tomorrow, watch my back, ok? I'll watch yours. You watch your own back first. Then you worry about everybody else's. That's what I'll be doing. * I believe in miracles * since you came along * you sexy thing * you sexy thing, you [Gunshots] [Shouting] Come on, guys! Let's go! Come on! [Shouting] [Gunshots] Move it! Come on! Move it! Move it! There's the house over the next rise! I see it! Let's go! Let's go quick! Move it! Bastards! Goddamn freaks! We can make it! Come on! Drop down! [Voices over radio] I'll bust the door. Hyah! Come on, Jamie! Bring him in! Do you hear me? Aah! Agent on radio: Fire, fire, fire, fire! Full fire! [Gunshots] Aah! All right! I give up already! Stop shooting. [Gunshots] Stop! [Silence] [Gunshot] [Gunshots slow down in distance] You get hit? Something in my back. [Gunshots] [Coughing] Ow. There. Now you got eight lives left. Ugh! I got way less than that. Oh, jeez! Ugh! Ugh! Buddy, can you hear me? Oh, man. Oh, shit! Gunshot, front to back. He's out. Kit. Oh, god. Muzzle burn. Somebody shot him up close and personal. They looked him right in his eye and capped him. Who would do that? A kid like this. I mean, they--they-- they just started shooting. Pressure. Oh, god. That was chaos. I've never been so scared in my life. I couldn't even get my damn legs to move. Federal agent, we have a warrant for the arrest of Thomas b. Fremont, a search and seizure order for the house, section 101.2b of the Texas penal code. Agent over megaphone: We are federal agents! I was way wrong. They knew we were coming. Yeah. Might as well have put an ad in the paper. Come on, pressure! His pulse is weak. We got to get him to a hospital. Negative. We stay put. Dressing. What?! He's going to bleed to death! I got news for you, Irish. We got a half mile between US and police lines. A half mile of open ground in full sight of their rifles. I can't see our guys from here. I think they set up a barricade down by that road. [Gunshots] This place is as safe as it's going to get. Now, seeing how I currently outrank you in this organization, my word is law. We're not going anywhere. Call in our position. Agent: I'm hit! Bleeding bad! On a hillside! Second agent: All units, fall back-- [indistinct voices] Agent: Can somebody please respond?! [Beep] Well, this qualifies as far and away the deepest shit I've ever been in. I got caught selling reefer in the boys' bathroom in 10th grade, but, uh, no, today-- today pretty much blows that out of the water, I think. Well, pray it don't get no worse. [Rifle cocks] I'm going to move the kid to another room, get him comfortable. You check out that east side. You see anybody coming over that rise from that compound, you take them down. Got it? No questions asked. Just kill 'em. Yeah, I hear you. Man, I hate Texas. [Door closes] [Banging] Bama. Bama, we got incoming! Bama! Bama! Shoot to kill! I didn't I.D. Him. They could be our guys. Which way did they go? What'd they look like? I don't know! I just saw shadows. I think there's 2 of them. Got 'em! Where? Where? I don't see anything. Oh, fuck! I think they're behind the-- they're behind the car. I don't see nothing. You sure you weren't hallucinating? [Crash] Freeze! Freeze! [Shouting] You're under arrest! You're under arrest! Drop the fucking gun! What do you mean we're under arrest? You're under arrest. You got that backwards, boy. We have orders to detain any persons inhabiting these premises. You're with the bureau? What's it look like, asshole? Bullshit! Prove it! You prove it! I don't know dick about you. You think we're here for our health? Where's your windbreakers? Where's yours? Shit! You think I'm going to run around in uniform and let those psychos pick US off like fish in a damn barrel? You guess again, nigger. Where's your windbreaker, buddy? I got shot. I took it off. You don't look shot. How do I know you didn't steal those clothes off some corpse? I don't recognize either one of y'all. And you recognize a nigger, right? Jamie: Easy, bama. Tell me one reason why I shouldn't blow both your fucking heads off! You won't live to see me hit the floor. Jamie: Ok. There's got to be a way out of this. Password. Tell me the password. No way. You tell US first. Don't you do it, Hank. They could be faking. It could be assassins. Imagine that. Assassins with the password. Ok, look. I think I got a solution, ok? I'm pretty sure you guys are ok. I'm pretty sure you're with the agency. We all have to be sure. We're going to say the password at the same time, ok? We're going to shout it at the count of 3. Jamie: Bama? Fine. Ok, so it's bama and--what is it--Hank? Yeah. Ok. Bama and Hank on the count of 3. 1... 2... 3. God damn it! I told you they was assassins! You lying sack of shit! I'm not talking first! I'm not saying it! You a dead nigger now. You're dead next, asshole! Drop the gun! You drop yours first! Prairie fire! Jamie: The password's prairie fire, ok? Yeah. Yeah, prairie fire. Prairie fire. Zeke. Prairie fire, Zeke. Bama. Bama. Prairie fire, god damn it! Hank magill, Washington office. How you doing? This here's my friend Zeke. Zeke Clayton. He's a local boy. Yeah! Whoa! Well, god damn it. Shit! That was close, wasn't it? Thank goodness for those passwords. I tell you. I mean--hoo hoo-- that'd have been something filling out the forms on that one. Imagine that? Filling out the forms on that. Shit! Trying to explain why we all just shot each other to shit. Ha ha ha! Don't think they have a code listing for that. No, I do not. Oh, god, I need a drink. Yeah. Here you are. Evian water. It's still cold. Thanks. That's ok. So, Hank, are you a group leader? Yes, actually, I am. I am indeed. Group 7, surveillance and tactical monitoring. Well, Hank, that puts you in charge. So what do we do now? Um... There's a wounded sheriff in the other room. Is his name Barry? A young kid? Could be. He's in the bedroom. Down the hall. Agent over megaphone: I know you're listening in there. Now, i'm moving up some men to evacuate the wounded. Now, don't shoot them or nothing, ok? Just don't shoot! Ok? [Gunshots] Listen, Hank? What? Listen, this kid-- I think we got to get this--this kid to a hospital. And to be honest, I think we got to get the hell out of this house. This place is a deathtrap. It's not real homey, is it? I can definitely think of some places I would rather be right now. How did you guys get here? We, uh... We crawled right through the grass. Crawled the whole way? Not happy about it, but, yeah-- look, you know, I think we got to-- we just got to get on our bellies and get the hell back to police lines. Right? No. No. We wait for choppers to evacuate US. That's standard procedure. Jamie: They've got a Cannon in that compound that takes a helicopter right out of the sky. I don't think they're going to be sending helicopters. Yeah, um... Well, let me just-- I'll tell you what. I'm going to run that crawling idea back to the guys back at the cars. Well, Hank, I think they have bigger problems right now. I mean, I just think if we're going to do this, then, you know, we just got to-- you just take the initiative, you know? And we just do it. It's your call. Ok. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe you're right. I don't know. Just, uh... Take the initiative and we'll go out there. They shot him. They gut-shot him! He went to high school with my cousin. Me and him play poker every Thursday night. How am I going to explain this to his wife? Those fucking crazy-ass, cult-suck, shit-religious bastards! I wish I had me one of them right now. I'd tear the life out of him! Listen. Hank was talking to me about all of US just getting out of here, and I think it's a smart idea. Hank. Hank? Group leader, right? Getting out of here. Yeah. We're going to work our way back to police lines back there. Ok? I ain't going without Barry. Jamie: Well, we'll take Barry, but we better leave soon before he bleeds to death. Zeke: How are we going to go? We're going to crawl. That's a long way. Ok. I can take him half the time. We'll switch off. Yeah, ok. Ok. You're ok, ain't ya? I mean, you're one of the good ones. All right. Let's go. Bama. Not going. Why not? They're waiting for US. Fuck him. Let him rot. Bama, why are you doing this? If we stay here, it's only a matter of time before a stray round catches one of US. At least let's try to get out. We'll look out for each other. We've done ok so far. Let me get this straight. Are you trying to tell me that what's happened today is ok? Man on radio: Can you, uh, you hear me out there? You policemen listening? I have something to say to you. "In the beginning, god created heaven and earth. "And the earth was without light and empty and darkness was on the face of the waters." I don't know. I heard they put assassins all over the place. Got them hiding out in the grass. What about snakes? They got snakes out there? Yep. Big ones. Look. Forget the wildlife and forget the assassins. Are you going or not? Shit. I'm game. Better than waiting in here to get killed. All right. I'm in, too. I just hate the damn snakes. Follow me. Can't see anything. Can you see anything? Shh! Bugs on me everywhere. I can feel them crawling on me. Shut the fuck up. Hank, get down! Hank! Hank, stay down! [Gunshots] Zeke: Sniper! [Gunshots] Man in distance: Hold fire! Hold your fire! Where's the kid? I left him lying in the grass. Agh. You're not going to-- hey! Shit. Jamie: Come here! God damn asshole! What the hell happened out there? They're still shooting. They're still shooting! You could've got US all killed! They're still shooting 'cause of you, you asshole! What's your problem, man? What's your problem? I got scared! Didn't go so good, huh? Zeke: Now, don't go jumping to any conclusions, but-- lookee what I found hiding in the basement. They're from the compound. Cult freaks. Followers of his holiness, the reverend butt wipe. Come on, girls. Introduce yourselves. Say howdy. Hi, there. Uh--ahem! You-- you're actually from the compound, are you? Yes, sir, I am. I've lived there for 5 years. No. 4 years? No, 5. 5? 5 years. What are you doing here? I just bugged out when they started shooting, so I just ran. I didn't know where to go. What's your name? My name is freebie. They call me that 'cause-- it's ok. Watch it. Tell US your name, girlie. Mary. Jamie: What are you doing out here? Same as you. Trying not to get shot. And you're from the compound? No. I heard all the noise. I thought I'd come see what the fuss was about. Why did you run? If you'd seen what it's like inside that hellhole, you'd run, too. They watch you all the time. You don't get a whole lot of chances to leave. I figured this was as good as any. Who told you we were coming, bitch? Huh? Hey! Hey! What the hell is the matter with you? All right, all right! She's an assassin! Probably the one gut-shot Barry! I didn't shoot anybody! Get a grip. All right. All right! I won't touch her. But if you ask me... I think we should interrogate the shit out of them. And if they don't say anything, then we should rape them, take them upstairs, and put a bullet in each one of their heads and say they got caught in the crossfire. No one will know the difference. I'm going to pretend I didn't hear that, Zeke. That's a goddamn breach of protocol. Protocol? Give me a break. In case you ain't noticed, Hank, we're in a war here, and they are the enemy. Well, if we're in a war, then we got the Geneva convention. This ain't Geneva. Where's Barry? He's on the porch. [Freebie laughs] [Hank laughs] It's true. Sometimes I eat strawberries. Hank: Is that right? Freebie: Ha ha! Hank: Ha ha. Listen, thanks for covering me back there. What you did was brave. Do it again, and we both get killed. I'm going to try to raise command on the radio. You talk to the girls. See what they know. Hank: It's kind of like, uh, like a free love kind of place? Is that what it's like over there? No. It's-- it's more like a big family. Oh, yeah? Yeah, it's nice. That's nice. Yeah, like, everybody's, you know, kind of like brothers and sisters kind of thing? Yeah, sorta. Ha ha ha. That's great. That's terrific. Yeah. That's great. Hmm. So, um, what do you guys do for fun over there? You know, all the sisters and everybody. All sorts of stuff. All kinds of stuff? Yeah. Fun stuff? Just-- fun stuff. Yeah? Like what? Come on. You can tell me. I won't tell anybody. You promise? My lips are sealed. Zip. Throw away the key. [Freebie and Hank giggle] Bama: Hey. When you have a moment, I need your radio. Yeah. Ahem! Here you go. Keep it, man. Did he hurt you? Not too bad. He got a little excited. It's--it's been a rough day. Yeah. For all of US. So am I a prisoner? I'm not sure really. You got a cigarette? So, if you don't mind my asking, what were you doing in there, in a cult? Norman, mostly. That's my boyfriend. At least he was until this morning. Crazy drunken son of a bitch. He went on the wagon when he met the most beloved son of god. Thomas b. Fremont. Turned Norman's life around. Put him on the straight and narrow. Quit the bottle. No more coke parties. I went along for the ride. I don't know why. I know it seems weird, but they seemed like a good group of people at first. Felt kind of safe, you know? I'm not sure why I do half the things I do. Anyway, Norman changed on the outside, but there was nothing that could change his true nature. Kept wanting me to have sex with all these other girls "for the greater glory of god." Of course, why god needed it on videotape I'll never understand. When I said no, he hit me. Same old Norman all over again. Can I ask you something? Why do men love to use their hands so much? Do they just get tired of talking and decide "what the hell, why not hit someone?" I'm sorry. I ramble when I'm nervous. How did you know we were coming? Me, I didn't know anything, but they've been drilling US for weeks. Fire! Mary: Really macho stuff, talking about the end times and how we had to defend ourselves, how the government was being run by Jews and freemasons, and they were all coming to get US. Everyone seemed to buy it. They had more guns in there than I'd ever seen in my life. Real convinced we could handle anything. Course, when it happened, all hell broke loose. [Alarm] [Screaming] Mary: I ran until I found this house. Here I am. What about her? I found her out in the field crying. A space cadet, you know? Not all there. No sudden moves, ok? Everybody's a little tense. Hey. Thanks for the cigarette. Man on radio: The beast I saw was like a true leopard, and his feet-- [click] Well, the girl says they kept her in the dark. You got any word? They must've taken a radio off one of our boys. Man on radio: "Upon her forehead was a name written-- "mystery, Babylon the great, "the mother of harlots "and abominations of the earth. "And I saw a woman "drunken with the blood of the saints and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus." [Click] That's revelations, the book of the apocalypse. The Messiah comes back to the earth and kills all the enemies of the lord. It's the beginning of the end of the world. Do you believe that stuff? You go to catholic school long enough, you start to think anything's possible. Command, come in, please. This is agent Ty Jones. We have a wounded agent at recon site number 2. Command, do you read? [Static] Agent on radio: We read you, agent Jones. We're sending help as soon as we can, but our res-- man: "Where they killed the burnt offering. "They shall kill the trespass offering. "And the blood he shall sprinkle upon the altar and the fat that covereth it." [Click] You don't think the girls are... Assassins? Could be. Might not be. No telling. What does your gut tell you? Well, you know me, Irish. I don't trust anyone. I'll tell you one thing, though. If she lives through this, she's going to jail. They all are. Excuse me. Uh, I have to go pee. Pee in the corner. Come on. She's a girl. Girls don't do it in the corner. Well, they do now. Actually she's right. You know, girls don't-- they don't do it in the corner. You know, maybe guys, you know-- rarely maybe-- I've never seen it. There is a bathroom down the hall. Come on. [Telephone rings] [Ring] [Ring] Agent over megaphone: If you don't start negotiating, Thomas, you're going to leave US no options! You understand? No options! Man: "And they shall make war with the lamb and the lamb shall overcome them!" [Gunshots] * and he smashed the spider * * and went crawling... * and he squashed [humming] Barry's dying. Zeke: I was thinking maybe we ought to-- we ought to give him some kind of last rites or something. You know? Any of you all know any of that kind of stuff? I mean, you know, religious stuff? Mary: I'm a minister. That is, I've been ordained in the church. A fucking whacko church! Barry's a southern baptist. You think I'm going to let him die in the hands of some freak?! I'll tell you one thing. Ain't no way your god is my god. No way. Whatever, but I was ordained in the church of universal hope. It's a branch of the baptists. I didn't spend my whole life in there, you know. It's tough, you know? A kid. I figured I'll stay upstairs and, uh... Keep an eye on them. You guys head down. Cool. All right? Yeah. Think she's gonna perform some kind of voodoo cult ritual in there? Well, if she does... Barry will rise from the dead... And y'all will be able to play poker again. You know... From the first moment I laid eyes on you... Mmm? I didn't like you. And it only is gettin' worse from there. Everybody downstairs. Man: It has become the habitation of devils and the whole of every foul spirit in the cage, every unclean and hateful thing to god. How long will thou forget me, o lord? Forever? How long will thou hide thy face from me? How long will my enemy be exalted over me? I'm not very good at this. Is there anything you want to tell me? Let's say a prayer together, ok? [Sighs] [Indistinct whispering] It's so sad. I can't believe he's dying. Sometimes... Sometimes bad things happen. People die. See anything? Grass, grass, and more grass. Clouds are pretty, though. If you see anything, you holler. You ever dream you're flying? What? I dream that all the time. I'm flying. I flap my hands like they're wings... Sail along... All the trees and houses... Tiny below me. There's this poem. An Irish airman foresees his death, by yeats. You know, William Butler yeats? I hate poetry. Pshww! You know, you are one strange yankee. "Nor law nor duty made me fight... "Nor public men nor cheering crowds. "A lonely impulse of delight "drove to this tumult in the clouds. "I balanced all, brought all to mind. "The years to come seemed a waste of breath... "A waste of breath the years behind... In balance with this life, this death." TV: He shoots! He scores! [Indistinct] ...in a tough backhand shot. [Continues indistinct] [Gunshot] [Girl screams] What the fuck happened? Aah! He got shot. No shit, Sherlock. Who shot him? He was by the window, and there's-- there's blood... [Sobbing] Then he fell down, and... We're all goddamn targets in here. Get the hell outta here. You take her. I got this one. Wait a minute. Take it easy! Uhh! Come on! Basement! [Sobbing] Please! Get downstairs. Shut up. Come on. Get down. Let's cuff 'em. How come you shot him? I didn't shoot him! Bullshit. His pants were undone. What the hell was that all about? [Sobbing] He did it. He wanted me... He wanted me to blow him. Oh, you stupid, white piece of trash, you! It's a goddamn lie. No, it ain't. I swear. I say we kill 'em, right here and now, get this shit over with. Fuck it, man! One of 'em shot Hank. For all we know, one of 'em shot Barry, too. Now, an eye for an eye is the way I see it. 2 of them for 2 of ours. That's justice. You're not shooting anybody. Doolin. Who the hell do you think you are, don't point that thing at me, man. Look, I'm sorry I hit you up there, ok? I could tell you were going to start arguin' with me... Start gettin' all philosophical and poetical about what's right and wrong. You know? I was just thinkin' now's not the time to be discussing things. I was just saving US some precious time. Now is the time for action. Huh? You're with me, right? No, I'm not with you. In fact, I'm against you. Unhh! Oh, come in. Damn it, doolin! You shouldn't have done that. You should not have done that. Leave him alone, Jamie. That's an order. Ahh, let him go. He don't scare me. Heh. See, I know what's up with him. Agent doolin here is a member of the lonely hearts club, isn't he? Huh? Took one look at little miss freak-o here, and... His heart went all pitty-pat with love... And the fresh scent of pussy. Son of a bitch! It's not worth it. Let him go. What's he gonna do? Kill me? For her? How's the bureau gonna feel about that? Huh? All right. I'm over it. Look. I'm cutting them loose. Can't let you do that. Bama. I am the ranking officer here. And nothin' happens unless I say so. Now, these two are prisoners, and I'm sayin' they stay put. Our assignment was to serve a warrant on the compound, to confiscate any illegal weapons, and to arrest Thomas fremont for possession of those weapons. That all changed once they started shootin'. We don't know that they've shot anybody. Bama, they were fleeing a battle zone! They're refugees. All I know is that people at that compound were shooting at me. And they're from that compound. That means it might've been them. Now, are we clear on this? Ok, fine. But we're not gonna execute them. I mean, Jesus, bama, we're not judge and jury. These girls are your responsibility. And I'm gonna hold you to that. [Static] Agent on radio: Agent Jones. Agent Jones. Come in. Jones here. Agent Jones, your direction. We have a code 114. Repeat--a code 114. Medic? Medical assistance call. Our direction. Send in a paramedic. Man: Numbers 1:14. Of the children of Joseph, of gad, of eliasaph, the son of duel, of naphtali-- [click] The kid. Is he still alive? I don't know. Command, this is Jones. Cancel... The code 114. I repeat-- cancel code 114. Too dangerous. Agent: Too late, Jones. The train has left the station. [Static] Numbers 1:16... These were the renowned of the congregation, princes of the tribes of their fathers-- if I ever get my hands on you, I'm gonna ram that Bible so far up your ass, you won't take a shit for a year, you scripture-quoting, cocksucking son of a bitch! [Static] Jones! Don't you think god is listening? The language of fornicators will not go unpunished. "Vengeance is mine," sayeth the lord. You know what that means, don't you, Jones? It means your time has come. [Static] Freebie: They're not gonna shoot US, are they? I didn't kill anyone, I swear. Nobody's gonna shoot you. Ok? What happened up there? I didn't kill him. Just tell me what happened. [Sniffles] [Sighs] I was giving the kid-- Barry--last rites. They were laughin' and gigglin', and I couldn't hear what the kid was sayin'. So I told 'em to be quiet or go someplace else. [Giggling] And the next thing I knew, there was a noise. [Gunshots] I checked his pulse. [Sniffles] He was dead right away. You believe me, don't you? I mean, what gun was I gonna use? I don't know what happened. I really don't know what to believe anymore. I do know that it'll all get sorted out somewhere...somehow. Thanks for being so nice. It's not goin' unnoticed. Hope they send US a tank. Flatten those bastards. Tanks are at fort hood. Won't be here for hours. [Sighs] Fuckin' government. There. Come on, man. Drop down! Drop down! [Whispering] Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. Stay low, now. Come on, baby. Come on, go! Go! Come on! Come on! Come on! You can make it. Go! You're here! [Gunshot] [Sighs] I was born and raised in this country. Been to every single one of the 50 states. Must've said the goddamn pledge of allegiance more 'n a thousand times. I've been married twice. And I've slept with 17 different women... Not including whores. Worked for the bureau for 8 years. And I've seen some lowdown shit. Pimps and hookers... Crack heads and killers... And knuckle-draggin' retards carvin' the shit out of each other with knives 'cause they were...Bored or just plain stupid. Ain't none of it made any difference to me because I'm a cool, calm, fighting machine. But this situation right here... This...is bad. Worse than I've ever seen it. It's downright UN-American. And we have got to do somethin'. We can't just sit around like little kids and cry. We gotta be men. We gotta act. This is the united states of america. We are government employees, and we have been severely fucked over! Well, I've made a decision. I am taking charge of this situation. It is time... For action. Aah! One down, one to go. Jamie: You son of a bitch! Bama: Stun grenade! [Groans] [Footsteps] Bama: Doolin. Come back here. Unh. [Groans] Ohh. Oh, you... Stupid redneck... Animal. Bama: I never met a white man so stupid. [Groans] Unh. You know what you've done? Do you know what you've done? You have executed a prisoner... Under my command. And we got 2 hostile witnesses that testify to that fact. That boy scout upstairs is gonna put US both in jail. Oh, Jesus. 12 years... 12 years I've been an agent. I got pension money coming to me. I got retirement. And then you went and... Oh, Jesus. If I go down for this, you're going down with me. What the fuck are you doing, man? Lord, i--i know you'll forgive me if I kill this stupid Texas cowboy. I know you will. No, no, no! Wait, wait, wait! Don't kill me, man. It's all right, lord. You don't have to answer me. Sometimes a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do. I'll get your pension back for ya. I swear. Just give me a second. Say good night, asshole. I can fix it! I can fix this! Mister? Hey, mister. You ok? Is she dead? Mary: I can't believe he did that. I mean, just to shoot her for no reason. Just 'cause he was mad. Jamie: Your people shot at US, too. Just because they were mad. Yeah. You're right. You're absolutely right. So why'd you pull me out of the basement? I've never been much for capital punishment. I don't get it. You're a cop. But you're the only cop I've ever met who's not into righteous justice. Have you met a lot of cops? They're always the same. Not you. You're not a typical cop. A typical cop would be my dad. What was he like? He was a red-faced Irish fuck. He was a sergeant with the Boston police department. Oh, man. He never met a bar he didn't like. He didn't have any friends outside the church or the old country. He hated blacks. More than blacks, he hated Italians. Really, he was... A living stereotype. Just right--just walked right out of a cagney film. But he was my dad. Is he still alive? I think so. Maybe not. I'm sorry. What for? What about? You don't get along. It's too bad. If I never set foot in Boston again, I'll be a happy man. Where you gonna call home? Actually, that's a nagging question. I bet you're a good cook. Do you like COD cakes? No, I hate 'em. Me, too, but I can make 'em. So it would just be... Beer and pizza, then. Sounds good. TV? Sports. Movies? Musicals? Yikes. Aw, come on. Please. Ok. After I'm asleep. I'm sorry. We shouldn't-- it's just talk. It's kinda crazy, huh? US here like this. I mean, the circumstances. Yes, it is. It's crazy. It's like fate or something. I think it's some really bad luck is what it is. Or good luck? No. I meant-- yeah, I know. Bama: Irish? Shh. Bama: Irish, you up there? You hear me? Now don't shoot me or nothing. I just want to talk to you. I never did nothing to hurt you, Irish. Now that's a damn fact. The texan. He was the culprit. Ha ha ha ha. You knocked him clean out with that hand grenade, though. Me, too. Hell, my ears are still ringing. Now I know this here is a bad situation, Irish. Shit is piling up deep. There's a certain... Tension in the air. That's stress. The stress is fucking with our minds. It's making US all wrong-headed. Made US make mistakes. And I know we got it in US to be more forgiving. To be more... Christian. Now, the way I see it you, me, and Tex, we're bureau men, first and forever. We took an oath, right? We pledged our lives. We're like a big family. We take care of each other. Everybody else in the world, they ain't with US. They're against US. There you are. Bama, don't move! Don't move! Now we make it out of here alive, we're all gonna need the same story. I don't know what your plans are, doolin, but if you think you're going to testify against me at some bullshit board of inquiry, I'm here to tell you that ain't gonna happen. Shit, I'll tell 'em you shot the girl. I will not be anybody's scapegoat. And they will be looking for them. First law of government, blame your subordinates. God damn it, bama. I swear to Christ I'll shoot you. Stay where you are. All right, easy. There's bodies laying all over this house. Now somebody's gotta take the fall for that. Zeke, he ain't interested. And it sure as hell ain't gonna be me. So that leaves US with you and the girl. Bama, you're not getting her. Now just go the hell back downstairs. Now you listen up. This here's the moment of truth. Big decisions got to be made. Life or death decisions. Irish, whose side are you on? Unh. Aah! Bama, you lying sack of shit, you were trying to kill me. Zeke: Oh, crap. I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry. Shit! Jamie: Mary, don't move. Don't let them know where you are. They'll kill you. Kill her? I'm gonna fucking cream her! [Gunshot] I blew out my knee, Irish. [Laughs] Bama: After all those years of football, I blow out my knee on a damn staircase. Come on, Irish man. Bama: This is crazy. We gotta talk this out. No more talk, bama. Like Zeke said, this is not a time for talking, it's a time for action. Jamie: You shouldn't have lied to me. Bama: I wasn't lying, Irish. I was negotiating. [Door squeaks] Zeke: Give her up, yankee. She's trash. She's cult trash. Zeke: Ain't worth the $5.00 you pay her to blow you. Mary, listen to me. Wherever you are, don't move. Don't move. She ain't gonna make it. I'm gonna whack her before she has the chance to talk to the goddamn police. [Floor creaks] Unh. I got no quarrel with you, yankee. Oh, I got a big quarrel with you. I've known you for one day, I'm already mad enough to blow your fucking head off. It's because of weak-hearted people like you that Barry had to die. And Hank. 'Cause you couldn't get your shit together and snuff the people that needed snuffing. Zeke: People who can't make up their minds are a danger to society. Zeke: Too much talk in this world, not enough action. Just fucking do it. Shit! Bama, you shot me. Where's Zeke? Jamie: Unh. I heard a shot. Where's the girl? Jamie: Fuck you! Fuck me, huh? Good riddance. Bama, call command. Call command and have them come get US. No go. Gotta get this mess cleaned up before anyone else gets here. You're not gonna kill anyone, bama. Sorry, Irish. I gotta do what I gotta do. I gotta watch my own back. Bama: Damn. You look pitiful. You can't kill me. Why not? Because i'm a federal agent. Are you on my side or against me? I'm on the side of right. Right is subject to interpretation. All you have to tell command is that she is an assassin. You want me to lie. I can't lie. I can't. Then I'm gonna have to kill you. You can't kill me. Which brings US back to my first question. Why... Not? Because... Because we're friends. Sorry, Irish. Ugh. Bama? Aah! Oh, Jesus! Jesus! Bama? Bama? What--what... He was going to kill you. I couldn't just stand here and let him kill you. Jamie: Oh, god! I don't know why you're getting so sentimental about him, Jamie. He was going to shoot you, you know. You killed Zeke. He was gonna kill me. You shot him? Yeah. And Hank? He was a real jerk. He didn't make it very difficult. You're gonna... Oh, god! You're an assassin. Assassin? No, I'm a soldier. You attacked my home. I defended it. I shot the kid, too. Barry. Ma'am, this here's a raid. You're gonna wanna go ahead and go back inside. [Gunshot] Hey... You didn't kill them. I did. You feel guilty, right? For taking my side. You're a good person, Jamie. You did what you thought was right. In the end, you were wrong. But that happens. How could you? Well, I'm a true believer. I'm not like you. I don't have any doubts. Whether you know it or not, Jamie, this is the end times. Look around. The signs are everywhere. Earthquakes, floods, riots, famine. This all points to an apocalypse in the year 2000. If you don't see that, you're blind. There are 2 armies fighting to the death. One battles for good, the other for evil. Thomas fremont predicted the dark forces would come, and he was right, Jamie. You came. So why didn't you kill me? You had plenty of chances. I needed you to protect me. They would have torn me to pieces without you. You used me. If you want to put it that way. You're breaking my heart. I'm gonna let you in on a little secret. You've got an easy heart to break. So I've been told. Come on, Jamie. That's not what this is about. Last-second heroics. This is about making peace with your life. And then meeting god. [Helicopters] They're coming. They're going to find you in here with all these dead agents. And they're going to put you in the electric chair. Oh, that's how it has to be? What you're doing is wrong. It's dead wrong. And if there is a god, and I'm not so sure about that anymore, you're gonna be punished. Mary, forever. [Click] I can see him. I can see god. He loves me. Man: Federal agent! You're hereby under arrest! Put your hands on top of your goddamn head! I'm with you. Hell, no, you're not! You're one of those scum-sucking cult pigs, and I'm gonna blast you to kingdom come! Go ahead! Shoot! God damn it, just go ahead. Shoot! Get your hands on top of your head! The fucking password's "prairie fire." I'm agent doolin from the amarillo division. Agent: That woman was an assassin. She was. Agent Jones? He's dead. She killed him. She killed all the agents. [Helicopters] Good god almighty. Radio: Choppers are up, command. Now listen, we're storming the compound. Agent: We're gonna bring all those wrongdoers to justice here. You able to walk? I think so. You be advised. This is a full tactical invasion. Are you ready? Yeah. Are you ready? Fuck, yes! All right. Let's go! Agent doolin, are you coming? It's the end of the world, isn't it? For some people, it is. Sure as shit. [Gunfire] Agent on radio: Returning fire now. I see a fire in the building. We're inside. You know, they got pretty far. But, you know, every night and day every day, getting love and satisfaction. And now you're lying next to-- givin' it to me. * I believe in miracles... You came along. * where you from * you sexy thing...
