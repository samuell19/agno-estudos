So Judith Hill approached me a few months ago. She was looking for someone to compose Balinese gamelan. -Hi! -Hi. -How are you? -Good, good to see you. This is Pak Wenten and Bu Nanik. -Hi, nice to meet you. -Nice to meet you. -Nice to meet you. -Judith Hill approached me and my wife to compose and to choreograph for her soul.

(laughing) I love it.

Pak Wenten had this idea of why don't we incorporate gamelan music into more of a funk setting? And that was something that we have to work in and get our heads around. And we're gonna just vibe it out and see what we can come up with, collaboration between a funk song and gamelan music. (laughs) ♪ (unintelligible lyrics) When I first played them my music, there was this like kind of shock reaction and then an immediate excitement of, "Oh, we can do this over here, we can do this over here." ♪ So today we worked on two different songs.

(melodic ringing) ♪ Over the years, I have collected many different sets of gamelan. ♪ (birdsong) ♪ So for this music video, my vision is to shoot it in a desert, and we chose Joshua Tree. ♪ There's a lot of challenges in the process of making this music video happen. First of all, gamelan is an ensemble. It's made up of instruments that's big and there's a lot of them, and you cannot just bring one and shoot it. You have to bring the whole set. In an orchestra, individuals own their instruments and they take them home. In a gamelan, it's really like it's one instrument. It's built together and it's tuned together. So you just have to know a little bit about the architecture, the structure of the music, to be able to listen to it. The sound of a gamelan is like a tree. The trunk of the tree is played by certain instruments. ♪ In a Balinese gamelan, there are two of every instrument, and they have almost the same notes except they're tuned just a tiny bit higher. ♪ And what happens is, when they play the same part, you hear this kind of beating. ♪ And that gives Balinese gamelan what some people call a shimmering quality. The branch and the leaves and the flowers are played by the Gangsa family. ♪ And then Kempli, the time keeper. (imitating beat) ♪ And then a small instrument we call Klenang. ♪ And the Ceng ceng.

I pray every day, play gamelan. ♪ I've been living here for 45 years. I tried to speak English, but I still feel... I'm Indonesian. When I first came to the U.S., I have two kids, daughter and a boy. The oldest was two and a half years. The youngest was eight months. I came here, I left my kids back home with their grandparents in Indonesia. The last time we saw my daughter, you hug her, you kiss her, you don't let her go, but then you had to. It's really, really, really, really hard. I feel kind of bad, but the long run, I think it was the right decision. Because we believed also that, before we bring our children here, they have to have a good background of their culture, so they should know Balinese dance. I based my life and my art, starting dance when I was young. ♪ (bird squawks) (insects chirring) (drumming) ♪ I feel the sound and the atmosphere, so unique in the temple. ♪ When you hear the gamelan playing... ♪ ...the audience reacts to your movement. ♪ That was the greatest feeling I had, even still now.

Since the moment I was born, music is more than just art and performances. ♪ In Bali, the gamelan is used for all rites of passage in one's life. ♪ From the moment we are born... ♪ ...to the moment we cross over to the afterlife. ♪ We have many uses for the gamelan's music and dance. ♪ It is used for special occasions... ♪ ...spiritual events... ♪ ...and entertainment. (applause) ♪ It is not only a big part of our culture but also our Balinese communities. These momentous occasions are not meant to be celebrated alone. ♪ Big events with gamelan are planned with the help of the entire village. These big moments and celebrations are what helps bring us together. ♪ Of course, outside Bali, the gamelan is most well known for entertainment. ♪ We have many traditional plays that use both music and dance to tell stories. ♪ Stories about love... ♪ ...gods... ♪ ...and ancient royalty. ♪ A vast majority of costumes and puppets are very intricately designed with the gold coloring to symbolize nobility and deities. ♪ The puppet in our play, I used to portray otherworldly characters that are within our Hindu belief and ancient stories. For example, the Barong Lion is the good king who fights against evil spirits. For example, the Rangda. (screaming) (bells dinging) ♪ For many events in the community, spirituality is infused with our gamelan and Hindu tradition. (dinging) (chanting) When someone dies in Bali, there is a moment of sadness, of course. But, we send our loved ones into the afterlife with a celebration. ♪ (cheering) (drumming) ♪ (cheering) When someone passes away in Bali, their body is buried temporarily up to many years.

(fire crackling) ♪ (birdsong) ♪ I just remember I couldn't take my eyes off of the dancer, 'cause I had never seen anything like that. I'd never seen how the eyes moved, and just the mystery just sucked me in. ♪ The dance is really old. The movement is like a mystery in a way. ♪ In Bali, people say that the movements are taken from nature. In rice paddy, the leaves are coming out, and the wind blew. The leaves are moving sideways. ♪ Sideways shake. ♪ Balinese women used to carry everything on their heads, and you see someone, it's hard to turn your head, so you use your eyes. You have the eyes to get the accent of the end of a cycle. ♪ So, the movement has that kind of lizard in the water. ♪ Because of her music, the movement will not be completely traditional. Well, I can do movement, but I don't ever shake with that, the music, so I have to adjust a little bit, her music. Hopefully I get it by tomorrow. Or soon. ♪ Yes. We should start the song like that, okay. So, I'm gonna record you, you could just play, like, some acapella. -Yes. -Okay, here we go. ♪ We recorded a bunch of different gamelan instruments, everything from the flute to the different percussions, to the different gamelan sets. It gave me lots of different options to work with. I think the biggest challenge with infusing gamelan into this song is the intonation and the tuning. We only get five notes in the gamelan scale, which makes it difficult to work into Western music, and sometimes things sound out of tune. ♪ Okay, cool, it's kind of hard, 'cause that's, like, in a totally different key. Given the nature of this song and that it's kind of like a quirky, unique-sounding song, I think that some of that dissonance adds a certain type of aggression, so it'll be interesting to fit both worlds together. I pitched it so that it-- it's in the key. -Yeah. -But, do you have that note? I thought--I thought one of the notes was in there. Yeah, and go doo-doo-boo. -Oh, okay. -Boom-doo, just like the octave thing. (dinging) I collaborate with other people. It doesn't necessarily change my way of playing gamelan. It's just to enrich my ability. I learn something new, musically as well as sound, how to make a new sound with the gamelan. It was really fun to play some of the stuff with Wenten. It's hard actually. It's just learning the rhythms, and really opens up a whole world of gamelan, and the possibilities are just endless. ♪ That was awesome, I think we got it! Incredible. (vocalizing) ♪ I think initially, the goals of gamelan programs outside of Indonesia was to convey traditional art. But, over time, the gamelan started interacting with its new environment, and people started getting creative with it. ♪ So, you have people like the guitarist Balawan. Even if he tried hard to be classical, his composition has that Western touch. ♪ So, that's why gamelan now mixes or combines sound using Western instruments, like saxophone. ♪ Or maybe guitar. ♪ I learned Western dance, modern dance, tap a little bit. My choreographer uses Western influence in it. ♪ Yeah! ♪ Thank you very much. (applauding) We love new sounds. The new generation needs to hear this different kind of sound. (birdsong) I was incredibly intrigued by both of them, and the collaboration of the two of them was just so sweet. It just made me want to learn more about them, and their culture, and who they are, and where they're from. ♪ When I see Pak Wenten and Bu Nanik working together, it's always really delightful, 'cause I feel like a lot of times they try to act like they're not excited to dance around each other, but there's no hiding how much they enjoy it. ♪ ♪ (chuckling) ♪ (applauding) ♪ The challenges of making this music video was that we have to make the music, we have to choreograph the dance, we have to shoot this. ♪ For something like this, two weeks is a very tight schedule.

(chuckling) (clanking) ♪ We're using Balinese traditional dance costume, which take a long time to change, because once you change the costume you have to change the makeup. My idea is to know this gamelan can be collaborative with anybody. So, we have to come out with a very precise idea. That is the most challenging thing. ♪ Scene two, take one. Indonesian dance is pretty complex. For me, it's very difficult, and I grew up in Indonesia. Just to do the eye movement, until now I cannot do it.

Scene three, take one. ♪ All right, one more time, that's a quick intro. Okay, okay. ♪ (unintelligible lyrics) The collaboration is a little bit hard. Six, seven, ooh, yeah, eight.
