(deep suspenseful music) Man: Every time it blows, I heard it last night. - Last night? - Mama, why did-- Man: I reckon when the moon's up. I don't know. Man: Yeah, you know where that gate's at? - Somethin's over there. - Right. (several people talking at once) Edna: Susan? Susan: Mama, I don't wanna. Edna: All right, you're disturbing your pa now. Boy: Well, I wish we could just pack up and leave. (creature howling) - John? - Hear it? (horses whinny distantly) Man: Lord, listen to that. Boy: The horses, Pa. John: Quiet. (wind whipping) (horses whinny distantly) (creature howling) Edna: John, it's back. Girl: Mama. Edna: Didn't you feed them? Girl: Mama! - John? - Mama! John: Little John, Stefan. - Yeah, Pa? - Yes, sir? Girl: Daddy? Edna: John Durand, you listen to me. John: Get out there. Turn 'em loose now. Girl: Mama. (cries) Edna: Susan, you hush now. Dorothy? Man: Those horses at the barn. What does it mean? John: Up in the hills. Man: Yeah, that makes sense. Edna: No. No, you can't! John: Edna. Edna: You can't. John: Oh, get going! Edna, stop it. Edna: John, that thing. Don't go out. Please, please, please. - Edna, Edna. (Edna crying) (door creaks) (wind whipping) Edna: Oh my, oh. John: Close the door behind us. Edna: No. Man: I'll go up there. Man: Don't (indistinct), dammit. (men yelling indistinctly) Man: Hurry up, hurry up. Man: Get back! Girl: Mama, I'm scared. (wind whipping) Boy: What are they gonna do, Mama? Mama: It's all right, don't be scared. Boy: What's gonna happen? What's gonna happen, Mama? (wind whipping) (creature roaring) (man yelling) Edna: Oh my god! (creature roaring) (Edna screaming) (girl crying) (creature howling) Oh god, father. Oh no. No! No! (screaming) (all screaming) (loud roaring) (loud exploding) (wind whipping) - Hey, John, how much further anyway? Man: Are you sure we're on the right road? - Are we? - Yeah, where are we, John? - John, come on, how much farther? John: We're just about an hour and a half away now. Man: Oh, my butt can't take two more hours of this. (all laugh) - Two hours? - I feel like I've been driving for about three days. - You guys wanted to get away, didn't you? - Yeah, but we wanted to get too. (passengers laugh) John: Look, we're nearly there. - Yeah. - I hope so. Woman In Car: Doesn't look like we're anywhere. Woman In Car: How can you tell? John: We're almost there. Woman In Car: Yeah, that's what you said about two hours ago, John. Man In Car: Hey John, turn the heater up, will ya? My, my hands are numb. Man In Car: So what's new? (all laugh) John: Here's the station coming up. Last stop. Man In Car: Great, I need to get-- Man In Car: John, where's the heat? Man In Car: Who needs something? I gotta go in. Woman In Car: Me too. (all talking in car) John: You guys need to get some water. The can's back there. Man In Car: This heater work? John: Yeah, yeah, it works. Man In Car: God, creepo. - Who's going in with me? - I'll go. - Nice place. - Come on, girls. Follow me. - Somebody wanna fill up the water can? Hey, Steve? Can You believe those guys? Steve: Y'all go on. - Come on, Steve, you-- - Go on. Look somebody's-- - Look at him. - Go. - Okay, you go first. - Hi. Can I help ya? - Yeah, fill it with a, premium please. - Nice van. - Thanks. - Fill her up, huh? - Yes, with a, premium please. - No problem. Say, where are you guys headed for, anyway? - Lake Durand. - Lake Durand? You're kidding. Nobody goes up there this time of year. (scoffs) (cash register rings) Woman: Wonder if this place has anything-- Woman: Let's get some gum. Woman: Sounds like a good-- Man: Harper, what kinda beer you drink? Harper: Lots of it. Get a lot. Woman: Sorry, you want some of these? Woman: Yeah, and let's get some chips. Man: Come on girls, come on. Woman: Hey, we gotta pay. (pigs squealing) (rhythmic banging) (pigs squealing) (horn honking) John: Come on, Harper. Come on, you guys. - Hey, come on you guys. Hurry up. Woman: What was that? Man: Get in, dammit. And sit down, huh? - How would you like to have him for a blind date? (passengers chuckle) - All set. Need anything else? John: No, how much? - Eight bucks. Man In Car: Everybody in? Man In Car: All set. Woman In Car: Yeah, come on. Let's get outta here. Man In Car: Come on. Harper: Yeah, come on, Jookie. He was just a big guy. Jookie: Harper, he was scary. - Check the oil? - Nah. Christ, it's gonna be dark before we get there. - Say uh, I guess you guys haven't heard about all the weird stuff that's happening up there at the lake? - Yes, uh, we have. Thanks. (engine turns over) (gentle music) (relaxed jazz music) Nobody comes up here much anymore, especially in the winter. The wind blows a lot. Used to be called Coyote Lake, in fact. The Indians named it because of the weird noises the wind makes up here. Pretty interesting, huh? It's kinda spooky sometimes. There're some great stories. Anyway, now they call it like Durand, which is pretty weird too. (relaxed jazz music) - Wow. - This is it? John: Sure. Woman In Car: How long since anybody's been here, John? John: Listen, it's been a few years, I guess. We used to come here every summer. Man In Car: Looks like quite a place. Woman In Car: Looks spooky. John: Watch it. Man In Car: How many bedrooms? John: Well, sorta spooky. - It is kinda creepy looking. John: Listen, it's a lot nicer than it looks. Man In Car: How many bedrooms? Hey Cal, wait a minute, will ya? Woman: Where do we go? - Right there. We'll have to go in through the back. (wind howling) Look at this. You guys are gonna love it. Solid as a rock. - Come on, John. - No problem. - Hey Harper, where are you going? Harper: Around the front? - There's nothing around there. - Harper. - Where the hell is Alan and Elaine? Jookie: Harper. (Elaine sighs) (birds cawing) - I found it. Nobody stole the damn thing. (wind howling) - God. Look at this place. Just look at it. And we're stuck here for the whole weekend. I can't believe it. Alan: Elaine-- - You dragged me into this, remember. John: Alan? - I won't forget it, I promise you. John: Will you bring some pliers? They're up in the front. - Oh, okay. I'll, I'll be there in a minute. I'm sorry, Elaine. (can clatters) (wind howling) (door rattling) - He's trying to get in a window. This place is built like a fort. - I think I've got it now, but... (door jiggling) Just won't give. (grunts) - Maybe it's jammed. (group laughs) - That's good. (eerie music) (Harper exhales sharply) (Harper gasps) (eerie music) (chandelier creaks) (bell chimes) (wind whipping) (John grunts) John: There, there. Woman: Oh, John. (group laughs) Man: Oh hell, John. Woman: Great, now what? Where is everybody else? - Where the hell is Harper? John: I don't know. (door squeaks) - Nice place, John. (all laugh) Man: How did you get in here? (man laughs) - Oh, there you are. We have to get some firewood for tonight. Sally's put everybody to work. Uh, you wanna come with us? - What about Steve? - Nah, come on. - Lauri, come on. We gotta do something to this place. - Okay. You two go on. - Where you goin'? - We're the firewood detail. - Well, that's more like it. Let's get going. - John? John? - Beautiful spot, huh? But, we oughta have some fun out here anyway. - Okay, okay. - Water detail. (Steve and Cal laugh) - Liz wants to come with us. - Well, let's get goin'. Cal: You guys be careful down there. (gentle music) You trust her with him? John: You wanna hear about this or not? Cal: What about the wood? John: There's some good stuff where we're going. Cal: Ah, unspoiled wilderness, huh? John: I guess. It's gettin' cold. (gentle music) Jookie: Something's funny about this place. (water plops) Harper: You uh, don't find this romantic? You, me, the lake, two buckets. Hey, don't get down. Okay, Jookie? We'll get the place cleaned up. We'll have a fire. Come on. - Some said they heard screams, howling, terrible noises. Wind blew like crazy. Place was a wreck. Parts of bodies were scattered all over the farm yard. They found the old man over by the barn. His head was ripped right off. Never did find it. They found one of the boys over near the edge of the woods. His body had been pulled apart like a wishbone. Man (laughs)-- - Okay John, I get it. All right? Where are we? - Eh, not far. Listen, they called it a natural disaster. They decided that a gas pocket underneath the cabin ruptured, ignited by the fireplace. (imitates exploding) So much for the Durands. - How about a tornado? - Nah, and there was one other detail that was unaccounted for. The midnight howling, it kept up. - Now John. - Scared the hell out of everybody. Cal: Maybe we better get back, John. - No, no, listen. It's not too much further. And you haven't heard the best part yet. Come on. So while all this was happening, the story got around. Supposedly, it came from this old Indian living back up in the hills here. Cal: An old Indian? John: And according to this Indian, everything that had happened was the work of the spirit. This thing called Shataba, a very evil, very powerful spirit. (wind whipping) (eerie buzzing) Legend was that it only came to life in the winter. It had been around forever, but this was its territory, and always would be. It chased the Indians' tribe off a long time ago, and ran off the farmers too. Was the spirit of the wind, that's what Shataba means, coyote wind. (wind whipping) (eerie buzzing) Come on. (wind whipping) (eerie buzzing) There it is. That's the Durand place. And that's the Durands. Pretty interesting, huh? - Why did you bring me up here? - So you could see it. - Okay. Let's go. - You're not even gonna look at it? - I've seen it. - Come on Cal. - Look, John, I know what you're doing. - Hey. Cal: This is your big one, right? - Listen. - And now I'm supposed to be in on it, right? Right? John: Well, not exactly. - Forget it. - Come on, Cal, somebody had to see it or it wouldn't work. - We better go find the others. - Ah, they'll be all right. Hey, Cal. Cal: Forget it. (eerie buzzing) Elaine: Oh! - What's wrong with you? Hey. - Steve. Come on, don't. Let go. - You didn't mean to do that. Did you? Hey, come on. - Why are you doing this? - How soon they forget. - Steve, I told you. Steve, don't. (wind whipping) John: Steve, where are you guys? - Over here. We uh, better get some firewood, huh? (wind whipping) Man: There were these two Jewish guys and then one of 'em said, "Hey look at Harry, he looks like a dead bird." And the other one said, "Where, where?" (man laughs) Man: The lake is incredible this time of year. I bet we could really catch some fish out there. You got rod and reels here? Come on, come on-- Woman: I didn't know we were coming this far. John: Cal, look, give me a hand with this door, please. (woman giggles) (group chattering quietly) (Steve and Sally laughing) Hey, Steve, Sally? They're counting the bedrooms. (group laughs) Hey, get in here you two. (group chattering distantly) (Steve and Sally laugh) (group chattering distantly) Man: Hey Harper, how many beers have you had already? Harper: Two. Man: You want another? Harper: Yeah. - Listen, Elaine, listen. About this-- - How 'bout them? - Boy, you guys don't waste any time, do you? Man: Here's to the weekend. - There you go. And to gettin' away from school. - And John's camp. - Yeah, that's right, John's camp. - Even if it is a little creepy. - A little creepy? - Oh, come on. It's creepy but it's cozy. Woman: I guess so. - All right, all right. - It has character. Creepy character? Woman: No, really. - Now what's creepy about it? - Everything's creepy about it. - Well, it's ours, anyway. - There you go. - It's nice, John. It really is. - Well, it's safe, that's for sure. - Safe? - And it's warm. - Yeah, unless you wanna get out in a hurry. - Safe from what? - Relax. - Harper. - Hey Steve-- - Cole Harper. I swear, Cole, if you start. - Okay, okay, I'm sorry. Come on Jookie. - You're sorry? You're always sorry. - Now look, I didn't do anything. - That's right. I mean, most of the time that's it. We scare ourselves. - Yeah, sure. Woman: Now wait a minute. - Or let somebody else scare you. - Are we starting in on this? - The movies are the worst, on television. Did anybody see the one about the guy with a sack on his head? He's going around town-- - You know, the news is the worst. - Mm-hm. - That creep up in New York, or in LA, that strangler business. - That stuff happens everywhere. - That's right. But it's crazy in those cities. - That's what I said. - Well, every once in a while somebody goes crazy in Podunk. - The guy with a sack on his head, just like that. - Yeah, you hear all kinds of stories. - If you listen. (Steve laughs) - That's right. - And most of the time, that's it, stories. John: Well, what do you mean stories? - Just that, weird tales. - Well, some of that weird stuff happens. - Oh, John. - Well, it does. - It did in his case, huh? (group laughs) - You know, people are always scared of stuff that they don't understand. - Heavy. - So we make up stories, right? - Based on some pretty creepy stuff. - Everything's creepy to you, John. (group chuckles) - Well, then on the other hand, they're not always just stories. Woman: Here we go. - Come on now, John. - No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Listen. Have any of you ever heard of the Moss Point Man? - The what? John: The Moss Point Man. - Oh, I've heard of that. - John. - That's right. And I know for a fact that it's true. - Is this one of those Bigfoot things? - No. - It happened near here? - Yeah, yeah, it happened down south, wasn't it? - Yes, near the gulf. It was in the paper for, for weeks. Lots of cops and all like that. - Yeah, had everybody pretty freaked out. - What happened? - You mean you guys don't know about it? - Well, let's hear it. - Steve. - You really wanna hear about it? - We're gonna hear it. - No. - Go on, John, tell 'em. - You're sure now? - Oh, wait a minute. I gotta get another beer. John: This is a really strange deal. - Harper. - Just goes to show you that some things happen that you can't even imagine. Weird things, things that come right outta the blue. You never know when these things'll happen, and you never know where. Now this particular thing happened a couple of years ago, There was this big party, end of school, whatever, some big celebration. And these two kids wanted to leave to be uh, well, well, you know, alone. So they decided they'd take a drive out to the sticks and find a place to park. (insects chirping) (twangy guitar music) Now the guy, Roger something, I can't remember his last name, had a great plan. He made one small miscalculation, he ran out of gas. You know, for real. Ordinarily, it wouldn't have been that big of a deal, but this guy, Roger, had also gotten them lost. They were miles away from any place, and didn't have any idea where they were. And plus, Roger was a little drunk and the girl had a curfew at midnight, so she was hacked off, right? Woman In Car: We're out of gas. How could you do this? Roger: Uh, eh, I, I didn't plan it. Woman In Car: (sighs) What are we gonna do? I'm supposed to be home by 12 o'clock. Roger: Look, I'll get you home, now just don't-- - Oh, great. - I'll get, I'll get a can out of the trunk. I'll, I'll get it out and I'll, I'll get some gas. - Well where'll you go, Roger? - Well, I don't know where I'm gonna go, but I'm gonna find a place. If there's a place to be found, I'll find it. Woman In Car: And what am I suppose to do, stay here? - You're gonna stay here and wait, right. Woman In Car: (scoffs) Oh, wonderful. John: It wasn't exactly your perfect evening, and it didn't get any better. He figured that she'd give in before she'd stay there by herself, and she probably never thought that he'd leave her there alone. - Look, just uh, stay put, I'll be right back. Well, what else can I do, huh? (insects chirping) (horn honks) - Roger! - What do you want, miracles? (insects chirping) (horn honks) - Roger! Roger, come back here. (insects chirping) (animal howls distantly) (tense music) (owl hoots) (insects buzzing) (mysterious music) (deep suspenseful music) (can clatters) (mysterious bouncy music) (evil laughter) (Roger breathing heavily) (deep suspenseful music) (Roger gasping) (object thuds) (insects chirping) (woman shuddering) (owl hoots) (tense suspenseful music) (woman crying) (deep suspenseful music) (object scraping) (woman gasps) (tense suspenseful music) (woman shudders and whines) (woman crying) (scraping and banging near car) (woman crying) (heavy dragging) (objects clattering) (car creaking) - Oh, no. Who are you? What do you want? Help me. Somebody. Please. Leave me alone. Somebody. (heavy dragging) (suspenseful music) (woman gasps) (woman sighs) (woman whimpering) (heavy dragging) (car creaking) I could be dead. (woman screaming) (scary piano music) (evil laughter) (scary piano music) (slow somber music) - The national park crew found the car the next morning. And they found the girl too. She was tied to a tree near the road. The amazing thing was that besides a few bruises, she was okay. Physically okay, anyway. There was one very weird thing. Bite marks on her legs. Human, you know? Well, in the papers that said the coroner said that it was uh, juvenile, tiny teeth marks. Man: You're kidding. - And on top of the car, small muddy footprints, no bigger than a child. - Well, what about the girl? - Yeah? - She was all right. Well, she got all right. She got a little (whistles). But she stuck to her story. The whole time she claimed her attacker had been a uh, had been a uh, a uh... - Well, what? Woman: Well come on, John. - A little person. - A little person? (group laughs) Oh for crying-- - A little person? - She was probably in shock, John. I mean, you couldn't blame her. - But, Cal then, how do you-- - Well anyway, it sure does give you the creeps. Can you imagine? - I wouldn't have stayed there. - Creepy is right. - John gives me the creeps. (group laughs) - Okay, but that stuff does happen. And not believing it doesn't make it stop happening. - What about the hook? Man: I've heard of that now. - Me too, I think. - The hook? - What's the hook? - The hook hangs around a lake or a lover's lane, sneaks up on kids in parked cars and slices them to pieces, which his bloody hook. (Harper laughs) (Jookie screams) - Stop it. (Harper laughs) - One time this guy was telling me that up in Arkansas, where he's from, this story about this old guy that was, oh, okay. Anyway, this story got spread around that a maniac was stalking the woods where everybody went parking, right? That got blown all out of proportion. There was absolutely nothing to it. But it just so happened there was an old guy living out there alone in a shack, an old bum, and he got wind of it somehow. Now obviously, he was a little strange to begin with. I mean, living out there alone and all. Anyway, he became the maniac. - You're kidding? - Wow. - Neat. - Well, he never heard anybody or anything. You know, he was a harmless old guy. But he'd prowl the woods at night, rattling chains, jumping on parked cars. Scared the hell out of everybody. - Really. - Power of suggestion. - Yeah, sorta. - Wait a minute. - Sure, that makes sense. You can build things up to a point where they really get crazy. - The Moss Point Man wasn't-- - Okay, John. Okay. - What he's trying to say is that people get ideas from things like TV. I mean, there are things like that, but (sighs) nevermind. - Oh, I won't let them get you. - Steve, don't. - You see what you're doing, John? - What are you doing now, John? - Yeah, what're we doing? - Oh, I told a lousy story, that's all. - No, you were right. - Would you believe they're arguing about spooks now? - Steve and Sally are at it again. - Watch it, Alan. - Personally, I don't know what she sees in that creep. - Well, anyway. - Uh, I think I'll go to the powder room. Sally? - Sure. - You got a hell of a big mouth. - Uh, would anybody else like another beer? - Yeah, me. You want anything, Lauri? - Anybody? - I think I'll have a beer. Alan, would you? Now Steve, you know, I was just kidding. But all this talk about ghosts and goblins drives me crazy. It's just plain silly. - We're just having fun, Elaine. That's all. - There are a lot of other things to talk about, aren't there? We talk all the time for god sakes, and never about that kind of garbage. What's the use? - Elaine, just knock it off, I mean, nobody wants to hear that crap. - Isn't Harper sweet? Such a nice boy. Cal: What, John? - I just wanna ask you something. - Are you drunk or what? - No, no. Listen, uh. What do you think about Liz? - Liz? She's cute. - Yeah? - She's lovable? - Be serious. - Why? - Well uh, I kinda like her. - Really? - Yeah. - Well take my advice then, John. - What? - Don't tell her about the Durands. - Oh, Cal. Listen, wait a minute. You wanna see something? - Like what? - Come here. Come here for a second. Let's see it's, right along here someplace. Ah, there it is. Read that. - You're kidding? - I told ya. Look at that picture. - John, this happened in the 40s, 1948. - Yeah I know, they lost a lot of equipment, and some pretty weird stuff happened to the crew too. Read that. - "Worst I've seen in 20 years working timber. Nobody can tell me a guy did that to himself with a saw. No way I'd go back in there." Now John-- John: Look at that truck. Wow. Cal: John, wait a minute. What does Shataba have to do with all this? John: What, what's happening, uh, uh there, look. Cal: No. It says here that none of the accidents were out of proportion, that they were unusual. John: A company line. That was the company spokesman there. Cal: Diehard. - Well, they pulled out, didn't they? - John, you know what I think? - Oh, come on (clears throat). - What's that? What are you doing in here? - Nothing. Dirty pictures, you can't look. - Cal. - Look, we'll be right in, okay? - All right, but hurry up. Everybody's already talking about you two guys. (Cal chuckles) - Well, it is pretty weird, John, I'll say that much. - Well, that's about it, and just between the two of us. - You sure? - Sure. Wild men and all that stuff is one thing. This is weirdness. Cal: So that's it, huh? - Well, there's another one along here someplace. Cal: You're kidding. - It's a disappearance thing. This family went out camping in 1959. Completely vanished, just like that. - John. - Pretty weird, huh? Man: There they are. Lauri: I told them about the dirty pictures. Woman: What were you doing? - John was giving me a tour down memory lane. - Well, come on. Steve's about to tell another story. - What story? - The green light, whatever that is. - Oh boy. Perfect. - I told 'em about my brother's school, where he went to college. Cal, my brother was a good friend of the guy that this happened to. You haven't heard it? Cal: I don't think so. - Well, this fraternity over there was pledging, you know? And they had these three guys, one of their brothers had been in before or something. Anyway, they couldn't get to 'em, you know. They knew all the tricks. So, they set it up for these guys to spend the night in an old abandoned hotel outside of town that was supposed to be haunted. (soft somber music) Well, it met all the requirements, that's for sure. It had been a real snazz place at one time, back in the big railroad days. But it had been shut down for years, and it got pretty run down and very creepy, All kinds of weird stories and ghost tales and stuff had been told about the place over the years, but nobody really knew anything about it. One very strange thing. The word was that every so often somebody would spot a real dim light moving around on the upper floors, moving back and forth. And they said, nobody had ever been past the first floor. So it was a perfect place, see, for hassling these particular pledges, to kind of straighten them out. Now, they knew what the deal was. So naturally, they were just a little bit nervous about it, but they weren't gonna let it get to 'em. (gentle somber music) Man: Come on in, they're probably watching us. Man: Just a damn minute, will ya? (object clatters) (footsteps crunching) Man: Quiet. They'd love to get us right now. - And have a big laugh. - Okay, okay. Jeez, this place is creepy. (grunts) Oh, Jesus. - Okay now, now the main thing is to keep cool, right? - Check. (man clears throat) (gentle music) Steve: The rules for the deal were simple. All they could take in were their sleeping rolls and one flashlight between them. They had to stay inside the hotel, till a car came for 'em at daybreak. And they were told not to go beyond the first floor, no matter what. - Hey. This oughta be all right. You did bring those matches and candles, huh? - Yep, got 'em right here in my gym sock. - What? - Yeah. This'll be just fine. We'll set up right here. (match strikes) Yeah, we oughta be able to see everything from right here. - Or hear it. Uh, we're just supposed to have the flashlight. (Darrell sighs) We're only supposed to have the light. - Look, knuckle brain. - Listen, Billy, anything goes here. If they stay outside like they're supposed to, they won't see it, right? - God. - Guys, just calm down. Settle back and relax. - It's gonna be a long night. - Still, uh, I don't know about that uh-- - One cruddy little candle? - Still, it-- - Still. Look, just figure we're beatin' the system, okay? - We should've brought some beer. - There you go. Or girls. - Yeah, this would be a great place to bring girls. - Did I ever tell you about Denise Reynolds? - What about her? - What about her? I took her out. - You're kidding. - Well, we didn't go to the prom or anything. John Ray set me up with her. Buck night at the drive-in. (laughs) Yeah. (mysterious music) (door creaks) - So then this big car drives up in the parking lot, and four or five guys in suits get out, right. So we tried to turn all the lights in the house out, but no. We heard 'em coming up the front. (laughs) There were people scattering everywhere. (door clatters) There was a stack of beer cans this high. (door thuds) Well, anyway, there was money scattered all over the place, and people were jumping out windows, man. Somebody even left their shoes. (laughs) - Wow. - But, but nobody got caught, nobody. - Oh god. You guys gonna talk all night or what? (groans) What's the time, anyway? - It's uh, almost 2:30. - Oh, Christ. Four more hours. - Well, the hard part's over with, Parker. Parker: Sure, sure. - You uh, you really think so, Ron? - Listen, let me tell you a little bit about this deal in case you-- (muffled banging) Scumbags, you've been talking instead of listening. - No, this is the first sound. I swear. We've been watching the door too, and it never made a sound. If anything, it must've-- (objects clattering) - That's it for me. You think, you think that's them? No. - Shut up, dammit. - Take it easy, Billy. (floor creaks) - What if it's not them? People have seen stuff, lights, stuff moving around-- - Wait a minute. We're working ourselves up into something. - I'm gonna work my fist into his face if he doesn't knock it off. - It could be an animal, sometimes they get into these old places. - Oh hell it's them, you know it is. - Damn. - Say Parker, why don't you just go upstairs and check it out? - That's not a bad idea, boy. - What? - Hey, come on, Parker. - No. No, think about it. They wouldn't expect it, see? We'll turn the whole thing around on those jerks. - Listen, you can't go prowling around in an old place like this at night. Place is falling apart. If they wanna scare us, let 'em come down here. If it's them. Well, I'm staying here. - You both stay here. But I'm not gonna sit here on my tail, waiting to get jumped. (distant booming) - Good Lord. - That's got to be them. - Well look uh, take the flashlight at least, huh? - No. - I've got it, bozo. Now look, both of you guys just sit still. I see anything, I'll holler. - Rats. Parker. - Oh, let him go. It's probably them. Besides, he's a big boy now. - He's an idiot. (tense mysterious music) (stairs creaking) - I'm cold. - Have you heard anything? - Nothing. He's been gone over an hour now. Look, uh, I'm leaving. I mean, uh, well this is ridiculous, Ron. I mean, they can take their stupid fraternity-- Wait a minute. That's it. - That's what? - We haven't heard anything. - So? - So if those guys had grabbed him, we'd have heard something. If anything would've grabbed him, we'd have heard something. - Well, I don't care what's going on, I'm leaving. - No, don't you get it. It is them. And now Parker's in on it. And now they think they really have got us. - Huh-uh. - No, listen. It's a test, right? It's a test to see if we have the guts enough to go up those stairs. - (groans) Ron. - Don't go past the first floor. Mm. - I don't know. - God, what a couple of dummies. They must be laughing their heads off up there. - I don't hear it. - Oh, come on, mate. Look, we'll go up together. If we back out now, we'll never live it down. - I don't like it, Ron. - Oh, come on. Don't blow it now. After all we've been through? Look, next year, we'll be the guys up there. Just think of the parties. The girls. Yeah, do it for the sweet young things of Sigma Sigma Sigma. All right? (mysterious piano music) - I must be crazy. Okay. - Great. - But together, right? - Look, this way, we'll never leave each other's sight. - I wish we'd have brought the light. - Look, I'll go to the top of the stairs. And then when I get there, I'll signal you, and you come up. They can't get us from behind. It's not that far. Look, see? I'm counting on you now. (suspenseful music) (Ron whistles) (mysterious music) (steps creaking) Careful. - Okay, okay, let's go. (mysterious music) (floorboards creaking) (door handle clicks) (Billy yells) (Billy thuds) Shit. Ron: Forget it. - What're we doin' here, Ron? - Look, there's one more floor left. I know they must be up there. Look, wait here. (Billy whistles lightly) - Ron? Ron: I think I found something. - Ron? Ron you, you better quit fooling around. I'm not kiddin'. Ron? Come on, Ron. Ron? (mysterious piano music) Ron? (mysterious music) Ron? (mysterious music) Ron, you better quit fooling around. (mysterious piano music) Ron? Parker. (mysterious music) Ron? Ron, come on. (mysterious music) (footsteps thudding) (door creaks) (deep suspenseful music) (Billy breathing heavily) (heavy breathing intensifies) Ron? (deep suspenseful music) Ron? Parker? (deep suspenseful music) (floorboards creaking) (deep tense music) (music intensifies) (Billy yells) (mysterious music) Oh! (mysterious haunting music) (dramatic chord strikes) No! Somebody help me, please. (crying) (Billy groaning) - Guys from the fraternity figured they'd be waiting at the door when they came to get 'em. They weren't. They found their sleeping bags. They combed the whole house from top to bottom. They called everywhere. No luck. Then, finally they found the door and the secret staircase and they found the two guys in the upper room. They were all scratched up. Bleeding, exhausted, circling around under an empty light socket, dangling from a tattered old pole, hopelessly insane. One of the guys never uttered a word for the rest of his life. They did get snatches of the stories from the other one. (slow mysterious music) - What? Well, what happened to the first guy, Parker? (John yells) (Jookie screams) - Wasn't that great? (Steve laughing) Steve: Did you see Jookie's face. (laughs) - Come on, Jookie. - Oh, it was really John's idea, man. He got us to the dorm one night. (laughs) - You did fine, just great. - Come on, Jookie. It wasn't all that bad. - It was just a joke, listen. - Could've happened to anybody, Jookie. He got a bunch of us in the dorm with it. (John laughs) - Yeah, that's right. Don't be such a twit. - It's perfect, don't you see? Somebody always falls for it and goes-- - Stop it! John: I don't know what you're getting so freaked out about, Jookie. - John. Just, just lay off, okay? - Harper. - He's right, John. Man: Okay, John. - Okay, okay. Well, excuse me. Jeez. - Well, I don't see what the big deal is either. - You wouldn't. - What? - Nevermind. - Oh, I get it. It's my fault now, huh? - Oh no, not you. You know, Steve, sometimes I wish-- - What? - Lauri. - Well what? - Steve. - Oh, what the hell? - Hey, come on everybody. Let's don't spoil everything. Steve. - Spooky Jookie. - Elaine. - And sweet, sweet Sally. Everybody's very best friend. Sally: Elaine. - Little miss popularity. - Have you ever wondered why you're not? - Good grief. What's with everybody, anyway? - It's my fault. - No, it isn't. - Oh, Jookie. - Well, I can't help it. I just don't like being scared, that's all. I don't mean to spoil everything. - You're not, Jookie. Harper, why don't you get her a Coke, okay? - You should get those glasses with all that hair on it. Then you get those (whispering). (John laughs) - We'll go outside. - What're you guys doing? - Oh hey, hi, Alan. - What're you guys up to in here? - We're not up to anything. - Just talking. Hey uh, what's going on in there? - Not much. John, you better go easy. - Oh, sure, sure. I will. Okay, now, how about another story? - Another story? - Oh, no. John: Sure. Who knows a weird tale? Man: John, let's stop for awhile. Steve: Nah, somebody has to tell another story. Woman: No, Steve. - I know one. - Harper! - Take it easy, Sally. - Oh, shut up. - Alan. Oh, I bet Alan has a good one. How 'bout a story, Alan? - What about you, Cal? (wind whipping) Liz: Oh great. John, what's happening? John: The lamps are getting low, that's all. - That's all? John-- John: Don't worry. Now, come on, what about a story? - What about the lamp? - We've got other lamps. - Yeah, the rest are fine. - There's plenty of light. Oh boy. One lamp flickers a little and every... See. - Now let's have a story. - Well, you're the storyteller, John. - Hey, I've got one. - I have another one, but I'm uh, I'm kinda saving it. - That's a good idea, John. - I know one. - What? - Nothing. - Now, come on. Lauri's got one. - Let's hear it, Lauri. Woman: No. - Lauri? - Do you really? - That'd be great. - Let her tell it. Come on. - Sure. Woman: Lauri, you don't have to. Man: What's it about? Man: What difference does it make? Woman: I can't believe you guys. - Give her a chance. - That's right. Well go on, Lauri. - Okay. (wind whipping) Well. (wood creaks) The little town I'm from is, is very old. It's one of the oldest towns in the whole country. Full of history, you know. Legends. Anyway, in the town there's an old Catholic cemetery where most of the people from back then are buried, except for one. Lorraine. She was an old outcast, lived alone in the woods near the town. Horrible looking, old. The Indians around there practically worshiped her. Not the townspeople though. Most of them thought she was crazy. They say she was a witch, and that they'd have burned her alive if it hadn't been for the priests. And when she died, the townspeople were able to force the priest to bury her outside the cemetery. I've heard all sorts of stories since I was a little girl about what happened. Whatever, something did happen, and it made those people believe that Lorraine's spirit was haunting the graveyard. Lorraine meant to have her place in the cemetery, that's what they said. She would, unless she was stopped. (cat meows) Of course, it happened a long time ago. But people in town still tell the story. (owl hoots) And just a few years ago, some kids from our high school were doing this project, digging for old artifacts near the cemetery, or something. What they dug up was an old, unmarked grave, empty. There was nothing in it. Caused quite a stir. The whole town was buzzing about it. Then it started to happen. People started hearing noises again in the graveyard, seeings things. And then one night, the cemetery was ransacked. Stones knocked over, old tombs opened. It was awful. (owl hooting) Vandals, they said. Kids playing sick jokes. That's what some people said. Other people said it was Lorraine. (wind whipping) (dog barks distantly) Boy: I don't know. Maybe there's nothing to it. What do you think? Boy: They said they saw something. Boy: Well, you know how girls are. Boy: Julie's not. She doesn't get bent out of shape over nothing. She doesn't see things. Boy: Okay. But we've been wandering around this place for an hour. It's really starting to give me the creeps, you know? (wind whipping) (brush crunching) Oh! - Sh, quiet. (wind whipping) (owl hooting) What the hell? Did you see that? - What? - Over there. See? - Oh, I oughta be home. - No, come on. Let's go take a look. (wind whipping) It was right about here. I'm sure of it. - It could've been a watchman. (scary music) Oh my god. (tense scary music) (ghostly groanings) - Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute? You're crazy. Maybe it's a trick. - Oh yeah? Well it's a good one. (both yell) (tense music) (scary music) - What? - Oh. (tense music) (boys breathing heavily) - I don't believe it. - We gotta get outta here. - Split up. I'll head for the west gate. - Okay. Listen. (ghostly groanings) (quick tense music) (boy yells) (boy thuds) (haunting music) (creature growling) (boy gasping) (creature growling) - Randall! Randall! - Steven! Steven! (quick tense music) (grunts) Ow. (Randall groans) (quick tense music) (suspenseful music) (Randall grunts) (tense scary music) Ghostly Voice: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. (Randall yells) (gate clatters) (metal creaking) (wind whipping) (slow somber music) - People heard the noise and came, but it was too late. Too late. They just had to go in there. They didn't prove a thing, you know? Nobody knows just exactly what. Somebody even said that they were the ones that... It's just so stupid. (wind whipping) (slow somber music) (wood creaks) (Lauri sniffling) - Is she all right? - Yeah, I think so. (wind whipping) - Pretty good story. - You think it's true? (wind whipping) - Listen to the wind. (wood creaking) - Hey Cal, the lamps are really gettin' kinda low. I know where we can get some more. There's a place not far from here. - John. - No. No, really. They're not open, but they live right there and I know them. It's not all that far. - They are nearly empty, Cal. - Sure there's no more, John? - Well yeah. I checked. - I don't know. - Look, I'm not up to anything. Go with me if you want to. - No. - Well, I'm not gonna go alone. - Goin' where? - Nevermind. - He's going to get a fuel for the lamps. - Oh, I'll go. - Go where? - They're going to get fuel. - Oh, sure, I'll go. - Where? What's going on? - Lamp fuel. There's some store down the road. - Yeah, I'll, I'll go. - God, let's all go, why don't we? Look, we can't all go. Steve. Steve and I'll go. - Let's do. - No, look, it's not all that far, and it won't take that long. - Let's all go. Let's leave. - Look, we're just gonna make a run to the store. Okay, Jookie? - We, we can't leave now. - For goodness sakes, Jookie. And spoil all this fun? What in the world is wrong with you? - It's okay, Jookie. It's all right. - Look, we're just gonna buy some lamp oil and some batteries for the radio, okay? - Look, we're completely out? - Yes. I checked. Now. Does anybody need anything else? - Money. - Money? - Oh yes, I forgot, money. - Money? - John. - I spent all mine on gas-- - Oh, money. I suppose that means me, huh? - Getting up here. You guys are just gonna have to pass the hat. (people grumbling) Well, gosh, sorry. Oh, nice. Real nice. Hey, thanks fellas. - I'll get the coats. (wind whipping) - Thanks, Alan. Woman: Be careful. - We will. Man: And if there's any beer, John, you wanna get some, please? - Okay. Woman: We'll have some food ready. (wind whipping) - Something's just wrong. (car doors bang shut) (car engine turns over) - It's this place. (wind whipping) It's this damn place. And John. I don't know. I almost wish we hadn't come. (light jazz music) Woman: All right! (light applause) Woman: Liz, did you find it? Liz: There's not any. - Anyway, you just have to know what they want. (wind whipping) (boards creaking) For the most part they're desperate or they wouldn't be teaching, right? (boards creaking) (eerie buzzing) Sally: (laughs) Get Harper to do it. Oh, and bring the pickles. - I guess she's just lucky. - Oh, I don't know. - Well I do, really. I mean, why does he stay with her? - (chuckles) They're both rich as a coot. - No. (sighs) I just don't get it. Now, Cal and Laurie, that's nice. - Mm-hm. - And you are too. Yeah, really. (wind whipping) (eerie buzzing) And you end up with Steve. (wind whipping) I'm sorry. I didn't mean it like that. - I know. - You don't know about him. Not really, I mean. Sally? (creature growling) (women screaming) Oh god! - Come on. - I don't see anything. What was it? Come on. (John and Steve laughing) - Hey, you guys. - Come on, open up. John: Come on, let us in. - Yeah, yeah, let's go around to the door. John: What's wrong with those guys? (wind whipping) (knocking on door) Steve: Hey, open the window. John: Hey, come on you guys, it's cold. - Open the window. John: What's wrong with you guys? - Harper. - Come on, come on. It's us, come on. (wind whipping) (Steve and John laugh) - Hey, what took you guys so long? - Pretty good, huh, Harper? Boy, you should've seen 'em. - It's cold out there, you know? - Boy, the wind's really blowing like crazy. Hey uh, hey, look at this. (Steve and John chuckle) (wind whipping) - What's the matter? - What's wrong with everybody? Man: Listen, you scared the hell out of 'em, John. Man: Yeah, us too. Man: Where's the van, John? - Up the road. We drove it up the road and ran back. But listen-- - Great, just great. - How could you do that, John? John: Well, we just wanted to liven things up a little. Steve: It was a joke, that's all. - A joke? (wood creaking) - Boy, winds uh, really blowing like crazy out there. Why, it nearly knocked us down. Elaine: I think everybody's letting their imagination run away with them. - Let's just forget it. - Elaine. Yeah, let's just forget it, huh? - Listen, Elaine. (several people talking at once) Woman: It's real easy for you to talk. - Well, it's true. Well, it is. I mean, here you are getting all worked up over some crazy stories about maniacs and curses and spooks and cemeteries, and Wolfman, or whatever that thing was supposed to be in the window. - If you had been there-- (all talking at once) - Now, wait a minute, let her talk. Woman: Real easy for you, sweetheart. - I mean, think about it. What are the odds of running into anything like that? John: Ah, the odds don't matter. - What I'm saying, John is that it's all a bunch of nonsense. Like flying saucers. - Now hold on, people have seen those. Elaine: No. - Well, they have, there've been dozens of them. - People think they've seen them, see? - Well, what about all the pictures people have of 'em? Elaine: Fakes, obviously. - Nah. - Look, what I'm getting at is this, dummy. The really creepy things that happen, aren't supernatural. They're human, very human. Man: Yeah, like John, right? - No. No, not really. Usually they're somebody you would never expect, actually. Somebody mousey, like our little Jookie there. Woman: I don't think anybody wants to hear about it, Elaine. - Or sweet, like Sally. Man: I wanna hear about it. John: Me too. Woman: Let's don't. - They're the people we never think would be capable of those horrible things they do. Woman: I'm not listening to this. Man: Clam up, will ya. Woman: Sh. - They go through their whole lives feeling ignored, unappreciated, belittled, used. One day, they're pushed too far and (fingers snap) something just snaps up there. They go berserk. They do incredible things. Everybody's caught off guard. Shocked, horrified, amazed, stunned. That little guy in English? You mean the girl right down the hall? You're kidding. I don't believe it. It couldn't be them. That's what's weird. That's what's really scary. I went to school with a girl once. I didn't really know her. She was a sweet little thing, apparently. Not overly pretty. (wind whipping) But very nice. You know, wouldn't hurt a bug. She didn't even date until we were seniors. No one even noticed her. She wasn't in any of the clubs or anything. Then a friend of mine decided to feel sorry for the poor thing. Badgered her boyfriend into lining up somebody to ask her out. So he did, but he picked the wrong friend. (mysterious music) After the briefest of preliminaries, this friend took her straight to our local lover's lane, up on a bluff near town overlooking the river. Very romantic. Man: You ever been out here before? Elaine: Since he gallantly offered to take the poor thing out, this creep decided she should show a little gratitude. Man: I'll hold on to you. Annie: I better not. Man: Ah, come on now, you'll love it. Annie: Well. - Tell me, is this your very first date? (Annie screams) Hey, hey, where you going? Hey, wait a minute. Look, look, I didn't mean it. Hey. Hey, come on girlie. Wait for me. (gentle music) No wonder you don't get any dates. Look, don't be such a turkey. Annie: I want to go back. - Try and relax a little. - No. - Come on, give me a chance. (fabric rips) Come here. I'm not gonna hurt ya. - No. Stop it. (Annie gasping) Stop it. (crying) Oh no. No, stop it. (man laughing) Stop. Stop. - Oh, come on. Don't fight it. I'm not gonna hurt ya. - Please. - Take it easy. - Stop it. (crying) (man laughing) (deep suspenseful music) Stop it. You better, you better, stop it. Stop it. Stop it. Stop it. (deep somber music) (Annie whimpering) (soft dramatic orchestral music) (Annie crying) (gentle music) - Some people picked her up out on the highway. She told them an hysterical story about some maniac who had attacked them out on the bluff. He came upon them suddenly, out of nowhere. Somehow she had gotten away. The papers ate it up. They never found the maniac, of course. He continued to terrorize kids out on the bluff. Everyone was sympathetic, for awhile. But she got very strange. She completely withdrew. We all took to calling her crazy Annie. Drove her right up the wall. (somber daunting music) So, when she graduated, her parents shipped her off to college in another state, so she could get away from all that. Forget the awful past, make new friends. She didn't make any. And she avoided men like the plague. Crazy Annie. (gentle orchestral music) Man: Take it easy. (people laughing) Come on baby give me a chance. That's it, yeah. (laughs) That's it. (laughs) (women chatting and laughing) - Listen, I'll see you tomorrow. I want to hear every detail. - Okay. - Bye. - Goodnight. What happened? Why? Why, I don't understand. - Isn't that mine? Isn't it? - You mean you did this because I borrowed your shawl? - Borrowed? You didn't borrow. You didn't ask. You took it. Where did you wear it? - What? - What have you been doing? You took it to the lake, didn't you? - Oh, for god's sake. - With that, don't think I don't know about that, what goes on down there. - You're kidding? - Look at this. In my shawl. - Well, wear it for good luck, who knows. - You're nothing but trash. - Trash? Because I date? Because I get asked out by boys? - Because of what you do. - Now look, I have had it with you, you little twit. In the first place, you don't know anything. And in the second place, what I do is my business. So butt out! - But don't you see that-- - Oh, shut up. Oh. - You're not even sorry, are you? - You are crazy, you know it? There's something wrong with you. - You're not sorry at all. - Just leave me alone. I mean it. - You will be. You will be sorry. You're going to be real sorry. - You are crazy as a damn jay bird. (slow somber music) (door bangs shut) Oh, it's you. Look, I'm glad you came back. I'm sorry. I, I shouldn't have taken it. I'm sorry, I really am. (scary music) Wait, wait a minute. (woman screams) (knife slashes) (jilted piano music) - The girl next door. The sweet little girl next door. It could be anybody. That's the scary part. It could happen anywhere. (wind whipping) (finger pops) (rhythmic clicking) - Crazy Annie. Weird John. Weird John. Warpo Harpo. Woman: Spooky Jookie. John: Spooky Jookie. (chuckles) - Spooky Jookie. John: Spooky Jookie. (people chuckling) (laughter intensifies) (rhythmic clicking) John: Spooky Jookie. (people laughing) - Stop it! Stop it, I mean it! (people laughing) You make me sick, all of you. Nobody even knows we're here. We can't even leave if we want to. (gentle curious music) I, I tried to get you to leave, but, but you wouldn't listen. There's something out there! Harper: Jookie, stop it now. It's all right. - Leave me alone. Get away! I mean it. Don't come near me-- - Jookie? - Please don't. Stay away from me, please. Oh, why can't we go? No! No! No! No! - Oh my god. (Jookie crying) Lauri: I think we should go. Man: No. Lauri: Why not? Look at her. Man: Lauri, it's too late. John: Yes, it'll be morning soon. (wind whipping) (Jookie crying softly) (eerie howling) - I think we should go. - Please. - Make John get the van, John-- - It's halfway up the road, Lauri. Man: Look, there's no reason to stay. - Lauri, just take it easy. Woman: John, please. Can't we? Woman: Cal? (wood creaking) (wind whipping) (eerie howling) (women crying and whimpering) - It's just a story. Woman: What story? - Nothing. (women crying) (wind whipping) Woman: What're you talking about? John: Nothing, it's just some crazy deal. - One of John's stories. (wood creaking and crackling) (women crying) Woman: Listen to that. What's going on out there? (eerie howling) - It's the wind. It's the way the wind does the trees. It's always like that. - It's that thing. (crying) It's that thing. He knows. - It's just the wind. - And what's howling? What, what is going on? Will somebody please? (wood creaking) (women crying) - It's a local legend. Shataba. (women crying) The wind. Woman: Please. What is it, Cal? - I don't know. John: It's just a story, for god sakes, I swear. (scary howling) (Lauri screaming) - What is it? (crying) Oh. (crying) (Jookie sobbing) - It's just a story. Jookie: How do you think those stories get started? (Jookie sobbing) Cal: We have to get out. John: Wait a minute. - We have to leave, now, all of us. It's our only chance, the hills. John: You're crazy. - I'm not going out in that. - Stop it. Now, wait a minute. - There's no time. - Cal. - John, for god's sake, tell them. (women crying) Listen, please, just leave. (wind whipping) (women crying) - Get up, come on. Jookie: Oh! - Get up. Cal! - You're crazy. - John! - You don't even know where you're going. - Steve, Steve, can we go, please? Steve, let's go. Please. (wind whipping) Lauri: But, Cal. - Just run. Don't stop and don't look back. Harper, come on, damn it. Harper! (wind whipping) Sally: Steve, please can we go? Please, Steve. - Elaine. (eerie howling) (objects clattering) (Elaine screaming) - Run, dammit! (wind howling and whipping) (glass shatters) - No! (screaming) (Steve yelling) (women screaming) (door clattering and banging) (fierce whirring) (woman screaming) (door bursts) (all yelling) (chandelier clatters) (wind whipping) (door banging) (wind whipping) (fire explodes) (wind whipping quietly) (fierce howling) (bold suspenseful music) (tense foreboding music) (wind whipping)
