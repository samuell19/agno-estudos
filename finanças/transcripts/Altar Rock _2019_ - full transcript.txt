(heart beating) (dramatic music) (heart beating) (people yelling) Attention please. Thank you, at this time I would like to turn this news conference over to FBI regional director of public affairs, James Gardner, who is going to give us more information on the investigation. Thank you. Thank you, Chief Oswald. I'll take a few questions in a moment, but please keep in mind that this is still an active investigation. I ask for your patience and that you would hold any unnecessary or inflammatory speculation. The suspect, Tador Bushati, 53, was killed in his Brooklyn apartment during an interview with the FBI investigating the New York city subway bombing this past fall. (dramatic music) Relax pal, put you hands in the air, real slow. (whacking) (crying out) The agent involved in the shooting at peregrine avenue and sixth street was following a lead when Bushati initiated a violent confrontation and was killed. (whacking) I want your contact and the money. I don't got it. Bullshit. (whacks) (Bushati cries out) (crate clattering) That's all we have for an official statement at that this time, I'll take a couple of questions. (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (crying out) What evidence connects the dead suspect to the subway bombing? I'm not at liberty to discuss any evidence at this time. (water splashes) (gun fires) (man screams) (dramatic music) Mother fuck. I want the names and the money. Fuck you. No, fuck you. (dramatic music) Give me your wallet. (dramatic music) Yes. Sir, a local police source reported no other firearms on the scene besides the loan FBI agents weapon. Suspect was armed with a butcher's knife. Chump change. Tador Bushati, your license is expired, imagine that (dramatic music) Your family, huh? Fuck you. I think it is, you know, I think I'll just keep this one. (Bushati yells) (gun fires) (Bushati thuds) Wouldn't you say that was an excessive use of force? Absolutely not, our agents are trained to respond with deadly force no matter what the weapon. That's all the time I have, thank you very much. (dramatic music) (reporters yelling) (dramatic music) Nantucket tower, this is twin Cessna November 247 echo fox, one mile from uptighed intersection 3,000 feet with information foxtrot. Heading 150 degrees. Twin Cessna November 247 echo fox, Nantucket tower. You're half a mile from uptight intersection, turn left at 080 degrees, maintain 2,300 feet. Intercepter replies you're clear for runway six approach. Rodger Nantucket tower. Hi, honey, we're about to lead in Nantucket. So we're a little bit late, I know. Here, nobody's more excited than Flounder. Say hi to baby. I'm trying to talk to the tower, keep my eyes on the numbers. Okay, all right, we love you, we'll see you soon. We're losing altitude, honey! Hold on! (alarms ringing) (plane engine rumbles) (plane crashes) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) Okay, everyone it's thumper time! (group patting) It's thumper time. (group patting) What's the name of the game? Thumper! Why do we play? To get fucked up! Please language, ladies and gentlemen. Oh shut up. Oh my God. Continue. (group patting) You fucked up, drink. I'll never keep up without Tillie. And where would she be? She's biking here. At night? A wise decision considering her license has been suspended. I've been sober one night this week and I'm driving. Oh great, you're my ride. So since her parents died Tillie's been drunk for weeks. Months, still counting. Tillie! Tillie my love. Hey babe. The night is saved. You had a head start. Yes. Oh. For dear Tillie I would alter my sexual orientation to whatever her preference. Oh you (scoffs). Niko. My man. Any success with your acquisition of contraband? Have I ever let you down? No. (girls laughing) Lou would go down for good weed. I genuinely resemble that remark. Niko, meet my two dearest flowers. Felicity going to Berkeley, and Tillie going to Columbia. Leave it to Oxford boy to introduce us by our lesser schools. I see you've found some more dearest buds. Nothing quite like the aroma of central Oregon. My immigrant compadre here is going to BC. Nice to meet you. Congratulations, Colombia, it's a really nice school. We haven't seen you around before. It's only my second summer on the island, but my first altar rock, thanks to Lou. Oh, and you're working for living that, that is, that is refreshing. You know, Lou here thinks that he's working class since he got a job turning on the sprinklers at the Nantucket golf club. It's true. Welcome. (Tillie puking) That's a disqualification before the first round. Such a pity. (people chuckling) (dramatic music) I think I need to go home. Would you prefer my escort? I'm sober, I can give her a ride. Till, do you want me to go with you? No, you just stay, have fun. Wait. Don't forget your mouthwash. (dramatic music) Whoa, you okay. Yeah, oh my bike. This man is a veritable stranger. He's your man, your compadre. You just introduced us. (dramatic music) You broke your bike. Yeah, I fell. Don't worry, I'll get it fixed for you. I've got some friends for that. An immigrant and a gentlemen. I understand him more than I understand you and your weird version of English. I can speak English properly, too. Okay? You boarding school boy, such pretentious bullshit. (engine rumbles) (dramatic music) What's up with the rain? Because it's Nantucket silly. So embarrassed. I'm used to it. What, people puking when they meet you? No, giving someone a ride when they really need one. You're sweet. You want? No, I'm driving. (engine rumbles) You okay? Stop the car. Huh? Stop the car. Here? Yeah, come on. Come on. (dramatic music) (water splashing) (dramatic music) Come in. No, I'm okay, I'm good. (dramatic music) (water splashing) (car door bangs) Here. God, you must be freezing. No, no, the water's warm. (dramatic music) Why didn't you come in? I can't swim. You live on an island silly, gotta swim. Yeah I know. Maybe you could teach me. I'd like to. (dramatic music) (engine rumbles) (Niko chuckles) Whoa, nice lights. Yeah, ready for the fourth. So all those guys at altar rock, are they all your friends? As long as I can remember. We're here every summer. Well, anytime you need a ride. I'll remember. Here's my cell. Call me so I have yours. (dramatic music) And I'll take care of your bike and call you when it's ready. (dramatic music) Wouldn't want to get you in trouble. No. (dramatic music) Bye. Bye. (car door bangs) (dramatic music) (engine rumbles) (door clicks) Where do you think you're going? I almost called the police. Come over here. Sorry aunt Jenny, I know I should have called. I was up at altar rock, there was no signal up there. I know altar rock, that's why I worry. You're not my mother. Jennifer is just as worried as your mother would be. Look, we just graduated, it's summer and we're all going to college soon so we went for a swim. You never heard of skinny dipping? Okay, definitely not something mom would say. What would she say about a DUI? I don't know, she's dead. Where's your license? Hey, just take it easy, all right? Go take a hot shower. That was Tramary by Shumont. Only two days left till fourth of July. Hope everyone up there in Nantucket has a happy independence day. (dramatic music) It's been every night now. You were like this when we met. Yes, but I didn't have to cope with losing parents. I'm really worried about Tillie. I know Chris, I've been there and she's on her way there. Here, I'm here for you and Tillie. Okay? Kay. (helicopter chopping) (dramatic music) (helicopter chopping) (dramatic music) Hi. I'm FBI agent Richard Cantrell. Phyllis, if you've got a moment, I'd like to ask you a few questions. For sure. According to my reports, this is the last airfield that the Gardeners flew out of on route to Nantucket, when plane crashed. Did you know them? James and Celeste? Bummer, really sucks. What we're doing is we're looking at the possibility of an aircraft tampering. Oh wow. So I'm going to need to see your maintenance logs and the hard drive to the security monitoring system. Well, yeah, whatever, have at it. Thank you Phyllis. Your a dream. (Niko knocks) Well, don't look so disappointed. She'll be down in a minute. Please come in. I don't bite. Niko. Jennifer Crane aunt Jenny to Tillie and her friends. Very nice to meet you. Oh, I volunteer at the battered women's clinic. I'm so glad I get the chance to meet you, close the door. (door clicks) Can I get you something to drink? I'm okay, thank you. So what do you do on the island? I drive a cab, saving for college. Tillie, Niko's here. That's a good thing, kids here, they just take Nantucket for granted. No responsibilities. Why'd you come? Eat. My mother used to work here a long time ago, Nantucket was her favorite place. Your mother has very good taste. She did. I'm sorry. Where are you from? Well, I grew up here, I mean in America, but I was born in Albania. Ah, that's where the good looks come from. Okay, let's go. Here let me help. Thanks. Niko told me he drives a taxi to save for college. Terrific. Later aunt Jenny. (foghorn blares) (people chattering) That looks beautiful. Good as new. I hope so. How well do you know Nantucket? I do drive a cab, but I don't get much time off. Oh, I'm going to have to show you around then. Now? Yeah, come on. (dramatic music) Come on. (dramatic music) So how about that swimming lesson? No, I'll take a rain check. (dramatic music) What are you going to major in, in Boston college? You know I'm not sure. What do you suggest? What do you think about engineering? I'm mechanical, I could do that. How about dentistry? No, I couldn't, no, no. Architecture. Yeah. I'd love to design and build houses someday. Single file, you rookie shit heels, single file. (bike clatters) (Tillie thudding) (speaking in foreign language) Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Hey, hey! You okay? I'm fine. Such a jerk. What did you say to him? I told him to have a nice day. Is that Italian? I took some in high school. It was Albanian. It slipped, people often mistake and we encourage it. Nobody wants to be from anywhere like Albania. No in America, it doesn't matter. My great grandmother, Matilda. She was a roma gypsy. You have gypsy blood. Well do like we do then, say you're from Northern Italy. (speaking in foreign language) (dramatic music) (key board clicking) (dramatic music) Thanks for the headshot asshole. (phone rings) Agent Hanley. Hey, Robert I've got the son of a bitch. You did? Yeah, he's headed to Nantucket. Nantucket? Yeah, look, this was revenge. James's, his daughter, my God daughter, Tillie lives on Nantucket. She could be next. I can't do this solo anymore. I need your help. Got your back. Thanks, just meet me there as soon as you can I'm on my way. (dramatic music) Good ride. Yeah. I hope you're legs okay. Oh, it'll be fine. You sure? Yeah, I'm accident prone. That's a beautiful house. Well, you just gave me the most beautiful day. (speaking in foreign language) Do I sense a new romance blossoming? We were just having fun okay? All right, the summer thing, before Columbia. Come on, let's walk on the beach. No more Columbia talk. All right, let's talk about Berkeley. I'm kidding. Jeez. Better be kidding. You know, I really would just want to hear about your new boy, Niko. Maybe. What, maybe? At some point. At some point? At some point what? Like where, when? Hey but you know what, I really, really, really excited for that fourth of July party. Oh yeah. It's gonna be so fun. It's gonna be good. Just before we have to go off and be adults I guess. We're hardly adults. (foghorn blares) (engine rumbles) Dock master to horn blower welcome to Nantucket. A light hand lizard on that position. (engine rumbles) (dramatic music) Marco! Look who it is! Holy shit, look at this boat. It's nice, right? Come on, come on, let down the gangway. Come on board, I'm coming. We need to celebrate. This is not a special occasion, huh? The two of us together again, after such a long time. Look at you, big, strong. Man no longer a child huh? I've been working hard. Working hard, that's good, good. You still in the same place or you move on? Yeah, everything's the same. Well don't worry, I'm here now. We're going to change that, want to drink espresso or what? Yeah. Come on, it's good to see you. So how did you like the truck I got you? I love it. All the guys are jealous. It's beautiful out. Yeah. So pretty. (dog barking) Nobody's more excited then Flounder. Honey, hold on! What if he's only using you for a green card? He's already got one, it's not like that. Niko's world is different. He moves inside it calmly. He's real, you know? I get that. But do you even know what country he's from? America. No, I meant originally. Northern Italy. Well, I mean, he is really hot so. You have my vote to let him in. Oh, thanks. (Felicity chuckles) (dramatic music) Hi sir, ticket to Nantucket? Yes sir. How you doing? Good thank you. 245 Cantrell. Cantrell? Yes sir. No charge, go ahead. (engine rumbles) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) Show me this video. I want to see this famous 4th of July Nantucket party. This is 4th of July last time summer. It was amazing. It was so much fun, we had a blast. You would love it. (audience cheering) 6,000 fat, rich, drunk American babies who are chanting USA, USA. Barking like dogs who think they own the world. Shut them up right. You did good my brother. Come here with our mother. Go to school, make friends. Learn to speak good English, you get the job and the green card. And when our father is butchered by the FBI you do not even blink. You do not forget but you don't blink. Like a true solider. He would be proud of you. Look Marco, I. No, don't talk. Just listen, come on. (dramatic music) It's nice to get here before the others. Yeah. You know I don't know anything about your family. Who do you have to endlessly nag you? Nobody. You say that so. I've been on my own three years. Your father, your mother? They all died. Oh God. I'm sorry. It's okay. Hey, it's okay, what's wrong? Let me show you something. Hi honey, we're about to land in Nantucket. So we're a little bit late I know, nobody's more excited than Flounder. Say hi to my baby. I'm trying to talk to the tower, keep my eyes open. Okay, all right, we love you, we'll see you soon. We're losing altitude. Honey, hold on! (dramatic music) God, that's horrible. (dramatic music) That was the last time I saw them. (dramatic music) See, we're both orphans. Only you're like a veteran at it. I'm still a rookie. Maybe three years from now when somebody asks me about my parents, I can be as calm and collected as you. No, no, I hope not. Do not participate in any lascivious activities without me. (dramatic music) What's up Lou? Oh, forgive me. How could you? I possess the liquid sex enhancers. Niko, my good man, are your herbal coffers sufficiently stocked? Of course, of course. Hey careful. It's just Lou, there's no one else here. Just old Lou. Fuck, fuck, this fucking hill. Oh and for edification Felicity has prematurely forfeited any duties as a designated driver tonight. Oh shut up, I'm perfect. Oh shit, fuck, this fucking hill. (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (audience applauding) I'd like to thank you all for coming today and sharing your stories with each other. I know this is a very difficult process, but remember our strength is in our group. Now, today is a very special day for one of us. It's the first anniversary for Jennifer. (audience applauding) Keep it up and give a hug to Tillie for me. Thank you pastor. I couldn't have done it without each of you. (audience applauding) (bell rings) Hey Jen. Oh my God, Richard. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to startle you. How are you, why didn't you call? Jen I has some disturbing news. The NTSB salvaged James's is the aircraft and we now have evidence that there was tampering with the plane. What? Do you remember a man named Tador Bushati? The suspect in the New York subway bombings last fall. The one who died in FBI custody? Yes. How does that relate to Jane? James was the public face of the FBI for television. Revenge? I believe so. This man maybe connected. Son of a bitch. We now know that he had unauthorized access to James's aircraft the day before it took off. Are Tillie and I in danger. Absolutely, that's why I'm here. Send that to me. Of course. How is Tillie. As well as can be expected. She's got a new boyfriend. Really? He's a hardworking kid from Eastern Europe and he's cute too. How are your sisters boys? Coping, thank you. It's been a nightmare since 9/11. Who knows what's next. (phone beeps) Did it go through? Got it. Okay. You know where to find me. If you see anything or you need anything, just call me. (Jennifer sighs) (dramatic music) (crowd cheering) Hey Joe, we got enough Triple A stocked? Absolutely. Great, great. Hey sweetie, can you push back those tables? We need to get ready for a big 4th of July party tonight, so let's just make some dance for our hot DJ tonight. (dramatic music) Some of the richest people in America live along this beach. You got all these mansions, soon enough they're gonna fall into the ocean. Climate change. It's so messed up. Multimillion dollar castles built on sliding sands. We created it. Yeah. (Tillie chuckles) (Niko coughs) It's all our fault. Hey, get off my beach. Get off my beach. Who are you yelling at now? Oh honey, go make another drink. I got a drink right here. Whatever. It's America, it's everyone's beach. Are you serious? You see the sand by all the grass? That's the high water mark. You're worried about sand? Yeah, my sand. Out there, that's public, that's their America. Where they're sitting, that's my America. They seem like nice kids. Oh, great kids. Okay, we're going. Yeah. You know what? Let's go somewhere else. Yeah. I'll show you my America. (waves lapping) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (upbeat music) (engine rumbles) (upbeat music) Your America huh? Yeah. The one place in the island I can't drink. What, why is that? My aunt and Chris own this place. God, I hope we don't run into them. Who's Chris? Her partner. (upbeat music) Hey, Rupert. (speaking in foreign language) Hey. Hey, roomie! What's up papa, hey! Whoa, wow, there's plenty of room back in the apartment for her. Not gonna happen Edwardo, not gonna happen.

Of course. What are you gonna name her? Right now? Yeah. Well I don't know. I got to know her better first. Don't worry, we'll figure it out together. I'd like that very much. Oh shit. Aunt Jenny doesn't do dogs. She wouldn't even let Flounder in the house, and now she's stuck with me. Don't worry I'll take of her until we figure that out. Don't forget I live with ten dog sitters. Thank you, I love her. (dramatic music) Thanks a lot. (dramatic music) See you. Bye. (dramatic music) (engine rumbles) (dramatic music) Tillie, thank God you're back. I didn't know how to tell you this over the phone. What is it? Your godfather came to see me today. Your mom and your dad. They were murdered. It was an act of revenge. Revenge? Richard thinks it was this man, have you seen him? (dramatic music) No, no. He thinks he could be a danger to us. (dramatic music) (car honks) (dramatic music) Ow, ow, ow, you're hurting me. Ow, stop, stop, stop, ow, that doesn't feel good, stop it. Oh shit, shit, sorry, sorry. (Marco chuckle) Get out. I need to get dressed. A woman like you has no respect for herself, therefore she gets no respect. Get the fuck out, Niko come on. Sit down, let's talk. You're a fucking asshole. Fuck you. Come on Niko, come on. Sit down, we good? Yeah. Miss. Get your hands off me! Take it easy, take it easy. Hey, I'm FBI. I'm not gonna hurt you. What is this, a bust? No, it's not a bust I just need to ask you a couple of questions. Okay, I'm no hooker so. No one said you're a hooker. Young lady, look I just need to talk to you about who's on board that boat. All right? What's your name? It's Rebecca. Rebecca. I need to talk to you about who's on that boat, okay? Okay. What were you doing on that boat Rebecca? The last thing I remember is being in the club and then I ended up with that foreign, hairy pig. Is this the guy? Yes. He told me at a nice boat and that is the only true thing he said to me. It doesn't make up for being a shit and an asshole, does it? No it doesn't. What about the other guy? No idea. He called him Niko. Niko, good. Listen, Rebecca, is there anyone else on board that boat? Not that I know of. Do me a favor and keep this conversation between us. I want to get those guys that I don't want to blow this bust, all right? Sure. No problem. Sober now, so won't be blowing anything. (engine rumbles) (gun clicks) Want a drink? (dramatic music) Who's this infidel bitch I see you with at the beach and the club? You were spying on me? Hey, I'm your older brother, look out for you. She's a risk, she could talk. Never, she'd never betray me. Why? Because she wants to screw you like all these fucking American whores? She's different. Maybe to you little brother. But to her, you're just another toy. Curious little boy to play with. So tell me, who the fuck is she? She's just a local girl. Good. Then she can take you to the fourth party with her friends and you bring the fireworks, yes? (dramatic music) Just make sure you bring the truck tomorrow. (dramatic music) I just finished a 24 hour shift, I need rest. (dramatic music) See you tomorrow. (door clicks) (dramatic music) Hi honey, we're about to land in Nantucket. I've been out of line. I'm sorry for being so hard on you. (water lapping) (flag rustling) You stop right there Romeo. Turn around. You think I'm kidding? Turn around! Move. (whacking) (crying out) (ax clanging) (crying out) (whacking) (crying out) (hammer clanging) (crying out) (crying out) (whacking) (hook clanging) (crying out) (dramatic music) You're little, I hate America jihad. It's over. (bone cracks) (Marco cries out) You fucking maniacs. You don't know when to stop. 9/11, New York, The Pentagon, now here, well whatever you had planned, it's not happening. No 72 virgins for a martyr this time asshole. James Gardner was a friend of mine. You made it look like an accident. No bullshit propaganda, no credit claims. It was personal. Hey, recognize this photo? It's from your father's wallet. I'm right I? Like father, like sons. You'll be glad to know that your father died the same way you will. (Marco spits) Mother fuck! It's personal for me too asshole! I'm here for justice. The subway bombing, remember? Your father. My sister was on that train. Obliterated, there wasn't enough left of her to bury. but there was something left. Four young boys without their mother, their father a broken useless wreck. I'm here for them. (Cantrell growls) Now where's the five million dollars your father was holding? Before you waste any more of it on infidel whores and big boats? Those boys deserve that money, not you. Fuck. (Cantrell grunting) Fine, you don't care about killing. You don't care about dying. James and Celeste Gardner, they got death. But you don't care. My sister, and 14 other people on that subway car got death. But you don't care. But you sure do care about the money. (dramatic music) There's something to admire about your brand of insanity. I could torture you, cut your fingers off. Gouge your eyes out, but you still wouldn't talk. But your little baby brother, Niko? I don't think he's so tough. I'll find the money. (Marco cries out) bomb making 101. That's primitive, but it's effective grant you that. My oh my. You have been a busy boy. That's just a little too obvious, but. (dramatic music) Huh? Yeah, it looks like we have a winner. Your father had the same kind of flash drive. Flushed it down the toilet, just before I shoved his fucking face in afterwards. (computer whooshes) (metal clatters) (dramatic music) Marco! Marco! Niko, Niko I'm down here! Marco, are you okay? Marco. Marco, you need a doctor. You bring the truck? Yeah. Okay, there's a knife up there on the table, get it. You need to cut me out. (dramatic music) Who's that? It's the FBI pig who killed father. He told you he killed papa? Yes, he was sniffing around for the five million. Five million? Father left it to me, money for the war. Marco you need a doctor, I have to take you to the hospital. No, no, no. Yes, my girls aunt has a clinic, I can take you. You see those two bags up there? That's the special surprise firework for the Americans. We have to put them in the truck, come on. (dramatic music) Help me. (dramatic music) (engine rumbles) Aunt Jenny. Hey Niko. I need your help. What's wrong, did something happen to Tillie? No, no. One of the cab drivers had a bad accident. He's a friend, he needs your help. Yes, okay. Do you need a hospital? We're pretty limited here. He's not legal. You understand? I see. Okay Niko bring him in, let's have a look. Okay. This is aunt Jenny, we can trust her. You'll find we have much better stuff for pain here. (phone dings) It's Tillie. Good, you go out and talk to her. I'll take care of your friend. What sort of accident did we have fireworks, right? Yes, fireworks. Maybe that's why they're illegal. Let's have a look. Careful. (Marco cries out) This is serious. You're going to need the ER at mass general. Oh no, no ER. I know you're illegal, but we're going to have to call an airlift for you. (phone tapping) (dramatic music) (bottle shatters) (dramatic music) (shelf shatters) (whacks) (Marco cries out) (head bangs) (dramatic music) (Jennifer banging) (dramatic music) (whacking) (crying out) (dramatic music) (Jennifer crying out) (whacks) (Marco cries out) It's okay Tillie. No, it's not okay. A friend of my fathers showed my aunt the picture of the man and he said he killed my parents now he's trying to kill us. He killed your parents? Okay, okay, stay where you are, I'll be there as soon as I can, okay? Okay, bye. (dramatic music) Wait stop, he's my brother! (dramatic music) Marco! (Marco grunting) She didn't do anything. She recognized me. She has a picture on her phone. She was a good woman. Are you fucking blind, this bitch tried to kill me. Is this how easily you deceived? Marco you need a hospital, we need a hospital. (dramatic music) No, we need to get back to the boat and get the money. We can't leave her. We only need one more day, come on help me. Help me. Niko! Help me! (dramatic music) (Marco grunting) No, wait, wait, get the phone. Get the phone. Wait. (dramatic music) What are you doing? Niko leave that bitch. Niko! Niko, we're running out of time, come on. (dramatic music) Hey Tillie, how would you describe this shade of red? Call it fuck me now, deep red. (Felicity chuckles) (phone dings) I think you got a text. It might be Niko. Did you figure out what you're wearing for him yet? Till? Whatever, new boy toy, I get it. [Answering Machine] Hi this is Niko, please leave a message. Niko, please call me. Please. (people chattering) (fireworks crackling) Oh. (door bangs) You're burning up. (phone vibrates) It's Lou, he's a friend. Everything has to seem normal. Niko, my man. Tomorrow promises festivities of epic proportions. And am I correct in believing I just witnessed you by Island Liquors? I'm stocking up on booze. And what about the uh. Yes, I have what you want. Yes. You are indeed the man. (engine rumbles) You have to take the money off the boat and hide it. Other martyrs will contact you soon. What? Marco, who? To Nantucket? Yes, Nantucket. The timer is set to go off 12 noon. You know what to do. (dramatic music) Whoa, pre fourth of July face plant already. A sad exhibition when a man doesn't know his limits. (engine rumbles) (dramatic music) (door rattles) (Tillie knocks) (door rattles) (dramatic music) You need a doctor. No. (phone vibrating) (dramatic music) Who are you calling? You should be quiet. (phone ringing) Hey Tillie. Sorry, I missed your call, my phone was dead. Is everything okay? I'm here at my aunts clinic, her bikes here, but the clinic's closed. It's not right. Where are you? I am outside Island Liquors. Can you meet me at the clinic? Okay, stay where you were, I'll be there as soon as I can. Niko, no, no. We need to get this boat back to the beach, I can't do it on my own, I need your help. I understand, but I need to go now. Everything I have done till this point cannot be for nothing, you understand that? Yes, I'll be back soon. Niko. Niko! Niko! (phone ringing) Her bike is still here Chris. She probably took cab. Listen, we're swamped here, I gotta go. (tires screeching) (dramatic music) Tillie. I'm freaking out. It hasn't been long, honestly, and there's so many crazy things happening before the fourth. I've called, I've texted, nothing. She wouldn't just leave her bike here. (dramatic music) Niko, do you know this guy? (dramatic music) No. Sorry to bother you. I know you have to get back to work. Tillie, it's no trouble, honestly. You just go, it's okay. (car door bangs) (engine rumbles) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) [Answering Machine] This is Richard Cantrell, I'm not available right now. Please contact my partner Agent Hanley at 555. (upbeat music) Spare no peperoni good sir. What, have we had enough of the tea and biscuits me Lord? Stuff it Henry. (phone ringing) Niko, my good man, about tomorrow. Yes, I told you, I got you covered. Listen I need you to do me a favor. Can you call Tillie? Can you enlighten me please? A boundless fountain of olive oil and vinegar. Her aunt is missing and she needs to calm down, okay? I have to work tonight. Oh yes, aunt Jenny, a previous source of numerous episodes of disconnection. Related directly to the effects of excessive alcohol. But no fear, I will find her drunken soul. Yeah, just call her, okay. Okay, bye. (fireworks booming) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) You okay? (fireworks cracking) Pretty good view for the fireworks, no? I'm okay, don't worry about me. You need to take the money and go. It's under there, under the bunk. (dramatic music) Father worked hard to raise that money for our cause. We owe it to those who gave to continue the war. Marco, you could still go away. No. She's father's final glory, you go. You make us proud. And when it's finished just disappear. You did not know this. Father was trained by the Americans to do their dirty work overseas. He fought his Muslim brothers on the promise of a visa. Better life, education for you. But they betrayed him. This so called nation of immigrants, they denied the visa. They sent our mother back home in shame where she was stoned to death. I wish that you had come with me and father to London, and not America with mother. But mama. So tomorrow you will remind them of the cost of arrogance and greed. And of what it feels like to have death come from no where. Is that all you feel now Marco? The need to hate and punish? We're not that different to them. And mama, she loved it here. She didn't go back in shame, she went back to get a legal visa to stay here. If only you could feel what I feel, but I had my America, and you never did. (dramatic music) Don't be a fool don't listen to their lies. Our course is true. Your family is through your brother, its true. You're legacy to this day and to me. That is your oath. (dramatic music) You understand me little brother, that is your oath. (Niko crying) You understand? Now go. Do your duty, go. (dramatic music) (bags thudding) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (fireworks cracking) (singing in foreign language) (bags thudding) (dramatic music) (phone ringing) (dramatic music) (waves crashing) (people chattering) (upbeat music) (people chattering) ♪ Been a minute, I got you ♪ ♪ Been a minute to miss you ♪ ♪ This going to get me back ♪ ♪ And while we're cracking loose ♪ (phone rings) Chris. I got back at three am, she still wasn't home. Okay. It's crazy, I can't get a hold of anybody at the clinic. No one is picking up the phone. I hope she didn't fall off the wagon. Called the police, they're over run with the beach party. I don't know what else to do. Thanks Chris. (upbeat music) Yeah, I just wish it was you and I. Not into big crowds. In fact when we get there can we just take a walk or something? Okay. (upbeat music) (people chattering) Niko my man. Hey. Are the goods in one of these oh so hipster, Yeti cooler bags? Now hold on, hold on, hold on. You gotta watch out for all the undercover cops around here. Don't want the party to end too soon now, do we Lou? Prudence is wise. Don't you judge me, to bring your delicate young canine to a beach prime for numerous loud explosions. Not so much. All right, I'll see you soon. I think Lou likes the puppy. Oh my God. Wait, who is this? Precious little thing. She's a present from Niko. Hi. Whoa, and I thought my outfit would get attention. This is gonna be ridiculous. I'm gonna get something out of the truck. Okay. What have we got here. A puppy. Can I pet him. Him is a her. She's almost as beautiful as you. Aw, you're charming. I try. (dramatic music) (phone tapping) So Niko, can you confirm who owns that glorious yacht off shore and explain why your dear friends have been denied access? Just a second Lou. What yacht? The same yacht I saw your Romeo escorting another fellow aboard last night. You saw Niko there? Entwined with a gentleman and instinctively navigating his way aboard as if returning home. I'm going for a swim. Tell Felicity to watch the puppy, okay? Shouldn't be a problem, hey, hey that's my board! (dramatic music) Has the hour arrived to spark up some fine central Oregon? Where's Tillie? Oh our dear flower impulsively decided to paddle toward your well endowed friends boat. Perhaps planning an offshore rendezvous. No, no. (dramatic music) Tillie! (dramatic music) Tillie! It's your friend isn't it? You lied to me! No, it's my brother. Your brother? (dramatic music) Your brother? Did he kill my parents? I don't know. (dramatic music) Where's aunt Jenny? Marco was hurt. I took him to your aunt. She was trying to help, I didn't know what he would do. Oh my God. Oh my God. Tillie, Tillie. (dramatic music) Marco. Wait. Please Tillie, you shouldn't be, you shouldn't be here. Why, why my parents? What did we ever do to you? When else were you and your brother doing? I had a family to, Marco was all I had left. Aunt Jenny was all I had left. You made me believe like I was getting my life back. Stupid, stupid me! What else were you doing? Marco put bombs in the cooler bags on the truck. No Tillie wait, wait, Tillie wait, just let me explain Tillie. (Tillie whacks) But. (Tillie whacks) Tillie, Tillie, Tillie. (Tillie cries out) (watch splashes) (dramatic music) Niko! (water splashes) (dramatic music) (Tillie coughs) (dramatic music) (watch beeping) (dramatic music) There's a bomb, there's a bomb! A bomb, move, there's a bomb! No bomb, look, just champaign and a little weed. Listen, ow officer, come on! He's right, he's right, no bomb. Just a cooler full of champaign. Tillie, I'm Agent Hanley. We found your aunt. I'm so sorry, thank God you're here in one piece. Now we got here as fast as we could. Where's the suspect? Dead on the boat. And your boyfriend? Bottom of the sea. Your godfather, my partner, Agent Cantrell? We got an anonymous call to 911 with his location. We found him at the marina on a small boat. He's in critical condition at Mass General. He just might make it. I'm sorry, excuse me. Sarge. All right, what have we got? Well both coolers are just filled with champaign and ice. Nothing consistent with an IED, we're all clear. All right. Let's leave the truck. (watch beeping) (suspenseful music) (boat booms) I'm sorry. (dramatic music) Holy shit. (dramatic music) Dear Tillie, I'm sorry I'm not gonna be with you for a while. I know I've made some mistakes, and I'm prepared to pay the price. I hope the explosion was far enough away that nobody was hurt. I took the FBI agent to the marina and called 911. I hope he's okay. I'm so sorry about aunt Jenny. She was so kind and I felt safe with her. Marco is my brother but I didn't see it coming. She was such a good woman. I hope you can find someway to forgive me. I'll work hard. I've decided to take your advice and major in architecture. It was always my dream to become an American citizen. It'll probably stay a dream considering. My father wanted us to use this money for war but we can use it for good. I know that's what my mother would have wanted. But I love you Tillie and I'm loyal to you and only you for the rest of our lives we'll spend together. I love you Tillie.
