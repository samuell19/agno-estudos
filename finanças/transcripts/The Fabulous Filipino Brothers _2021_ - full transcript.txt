It's a love story, kinda. It's their quest to get it, keep it, and maintain it. You know, that white picket fence thing. Or, in this case, brown bamboo fence? -Hey. Babe. -You're so late. -I'm so sorry. -That's okay, everybody's waiting. Okay, thank you. Thank you so much. -Pop! -Hello. Hey, you're late. I know, I know, I know, I know. There's just been, I have so much going on. [narrator] If you didn't get it by now, they're Filipino. Specifically, Filipino-American. In some ways, it's the same, and in other ways, very different. Generous by nature, Filipinos adapt to their surroundings more than most. I mean… I mean, it makes sense. They've been occupied by the Americans, the Japanese… Heck, the country is named after King Philip II of Spain. [woman] Hey! [narrator] It's probably why we say "bahala na" so much. Come what may. Anyway, point being, Filipinos are a weird mix. Like, they're Asians, but, like, the other Asians. Which is kind of fitting, since this story takes place in Pittsburg. The other Pittsburg, without the "H." Pittsburg, California. I know, I know, but I'm right on time. [speaking Tagalog] -You have your brothers waiting. -I know, I know. [narrator] And this tale begins at a classic Filipino tradition, a wedding. -All right, here we go. -[glasses clinking] -Let's go, it's a big day. -Cheers. Big day. [glasses thudding] -[sighs happily] -Ah! -Whoa. -Amazing. [narrator] Brothers have a unique relationship. Longest relationship most have in their lives. They know each other better than anyone else, but they couldn't be more different. [brothers chattering] Look, don't get me wrong. They're thick as thieves and they love each other immensely. But there are unspoken agreements that deprive them from fully developing that keeps them in their lanes. The reliable one, the lucky one, the funny one, the dark one. -[dishes clattering] -Hey, Pop. Good morning, everyone. [speaking Tagalog] [speaking Tagalog] [Emily] You can't speak, fool. Where are you guys coming from? -From church. -It's Friday. They go to church on Friday now. But I thought she went to church on Sundays and Wednesdays. -Yeah, well, she goes on Fridays now too. -Man, they be going almost every day. I think she thinks she's gonna die soon, and I think she thinks this is her ticket to get into heaven. -That's not how it works. -Oh, I know, I tried to tell her. [man] Hey, guys. Somebody has to take Lola to her dialysis later. [Doris] I got her on the way to work, but somebody's got to pick her up. -David, pick up grandma. -What? I um... You ain't doing shit, so you pick up Lola. Let me check my schedule. Pass the Ensenada. -What'd you say? -Pass the Ensenada. What are you talking about, man? This is called pandesal. -Same thing. -Uh, no it ain't. -They're bread. -Huh? -[man 1] Shut up. -[man 2] You shut up. Okay, okay stop it. Look. One is bread that's kind of sweet and has cheese on top. The other one is regular bread, all right? You take it, you open it in half like that, you put the longganisa inside, see? Okay, yeah, okay that's cool, but I want the Ensenada. Pass the Ensenada. Ensaymada. Ensenada is in Mexico. -That's what I said. -No you didn't, fool. [brothers' mom] Hey, boys, I just talked to Tita Flor, and they're looking for a new president for the Fil-American Association. Oh, Ma, work's been crazy. [Dayo] Yeah, Ma, the kids are doing a lot of sports. Hey, Ma, David would be good. -You think I could win? -David? No, no, no, David. -[brothers' mom] This is our community. -[laughs] You practically grew up there singing and dancing. A representative from our family would be good as a way to give back. As it is, you guys don't even Tagalog. I know, it's partly our fault. It's not our fault. They didn't wanna learn. [brothers' mom] You know, I just don't want you guys to lose touch. Okay? Hey, you will have to order the lechon. Hey, Mom and Dad can't afford to pay for all this. It's gonna be expensive. You know, I ain't got much, man, but I'm gonna be there. -Yeah? -Yeah, I'm gonna help out and whatnot. Hey, look, it's not that big a deal. It's just a little party. -It's a wedding, people have to eat. -Oh, and drink. -How many people we talking? -God, who knows? -I don't know who mom invited. -Um, everyone. -For sure. -Whoa, whoa, wait, so then that's like… -Uncle Jake, Uncle Dom, Uncle Boy. -And their wives. And kids. Then you got Auntie Dulce, Auntie Pinky, Auntie Barbara. -And their husbands. -And kids. That's Dad's side. Mom's side? Oh, then you got Auntie Bernie, Auntie Nita, Auntie Elsie, and Uncle Chet. [David] And? [woman] And their husbands and wives and kids, yeah. [David] Well then, damn, that's, like, over 100 people already. [Doris] And don't forget about her friends and family. Fuck, that's a lot of people. David, you gonna bring someone? You better not be bringing any hoes. Guess not. Okay, so we're going to need a lot of food. We're going to need two lechons. -Yo, let's just make this a potluck. -It's a wedding. We can't have people just bringing their own stuff. You don't know what the hell they're gonna bring. You know what? I got the food. -What? -No, no, no, no, we're all gonna chip in. Right? Right? Huh? No, no, no, bro. I said I'ma take care of it I'll take, I got you. No, I mean, it's gonna be expensive. I can help pay up for the food. -That's over 100 people. -[brother] It's gonna be a lot of money... No, look, I said I was gonna take care of the food. I'ma take care of it, all right? Period. That's it, I'ma do it. -I mean, that's hella food, man. -[loud slam] Dammit, David, I said I'ma take care of the food, okay? [narrator] Filipinos call the eldest brother "kuya." This is Dayo. You know, like the Harry Belafonte song. Filipinos have nicknames. His real name is Darius, although a White guy at work calls him Dale, like Chip and Dale. Dayo has always wanted to be the protector and in many ways he is, but the struggle is real, and his wife, Emily, isn't always the softest woman. Dayo, what the fuck? Why would you say that? We can't afford that. -I know. -Why would you volunteer us to pay? I didn't agree to that. Duke said he would help. He has the money. He doesn't have any kids or a mortgage or mouths to feed on a daily basis. I know, I know, all right? But Duke doesn't have to pay for everything all the time. Pay for everything? He doesn't pay for shit. I just need to do this myself. But it's not just yourself, Dayo. It's me and the kids too. Look, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I know. -[sighs] -I just have to pay for this, babe. No, you don't. I have to. I owe him. Who? All of 'em. But Danny boy definitely. Why? Look, not that I am complaining about this, but we are already letting him stay in the kid's playroom. I know. -For two years. -Goddammit, I know, okay? -[sighs] -I'll talk to him, I'll talk to him. But we're not like you. We're not Chinese. We're Asian too, yeah, but we're jungle Asian. -You know what I'm saying? -No. What are you saying? We're tribal. We live together. You know, growing up we never lived in the house by ourselves, just parents and kids. -We always lived with my grandparents. -Yeah, we still do. I mean, you know, at one time, I think we had like 21 people in the house. Three bedroom house, one bathroom. While you're taking a shower, someone's taking a shit. And what is your point, Dayo? Jungle Asians! But you know what? It was always a blast, it was. We always had a good time. You know, everyone was singing and dancing all the time... -Yelling at each other all the time. -Yeah, we're loud. But you know what? My mom and dad, they never turned anyone away, but they just made sure everyone was happy. I'm not talking about happiness. -That's not what this is about. -I know, but I'm just saying. I'm just saying it's a tribal thing, babe. I'm the oldest, my dad's getting older, and who am I to disrupt tradition? I don't want you to worry about it, but I have to do this. Remember when we first met, and you said that you'd always come through no matter what? That we'd never go without or hungry. Yeah. Go all in for us, babe. I'll get you the cookie jar money. Tell Fatso I said hi. Jungle Asian. ["7000 miles" by Ruby Ibarra playing] [narrator] There's nothing Dayo wouldn't do to take care of his family.

He loved his wife and his family fiercely and they loved him too. The wife never really did anything wrong. And yet he still loved another as well. You see, she is his childhood sweetheart. Though they never really got together until later in life. As they say, unrequited love never dies. You know the problem with loving two women? You can never be there fully for either. Yep, I'm just an old man. But if I could give you advice? Don't ever cheat on each other. If ever you fall in love for another, end it. And then you can go to the next and love her all you've got. But as I see it, I won't have to worry about you two. You know if my friend only looked at his wife the same way you look at each other… [woman speaking Tagalog] …he would have never had an affair with my sister. [mistress and wife speaking Tagalog] [both speaking Tagalog angrily] Excuse me.

Let's go. [electronic music playing] [narrator] The second oldest son is Danton, but he's always been called Danny boy. He's hard-headed. On top of that, he's brokenhearted. And for hardheaded folks, broken hearts are hard to mend. [electronic music playing] [speaking Tagalog] Doesn't he have any headphones? I've seen the headphones. Well, if we hear the music, at least we know he's alive, right? David, shut up. I'm just saying. -Guys I got to go, you got Lola? -[Dayo] I got her. It's been like two years. How long does it take you to get over something like that? Apparently, at least two years. It's true. I mean, she did leave him for another guy. Yeah, but they were kind of broken up already. -Yeah, but the kid. -The kid. I know. Leaves town, can't even be in his life? -Fucked up. -Fucked up. Okay, okay, geez, I know all this, but why do you have to agree to all of that? I don't know, she left him for your boy. Shut up. I think they're, like, in Michigan. I don't know what to do, man. You know? Try to leave him alone in his room where he doesn't bother anyone. But then, you know, he goes over there. Nobody sees him for days, and he's making music. Music, by the way, nobody understands. It's called electronic music. Yeah, well, it sounds like he's talking to the aliens. I know. Can we just... We have to find something. Maybe snap him out of it. I feel you. I think he's broken. I think he just has PTSD. What? Seriously, you know mental health is a big-ass issue. -Come on, David. -It's trauma. -David. -He's traumatized. Hey, you know what? He did it to himself. Sometimes things happen. Yeah, but he "happened" it. -I invited him to Burning Man. -David, I swear. -What? -Dumbass. He might be able to find himself on the Playa. I just don't know what to do to help him anymore. Kids, come eat some quesadillas before you got to Kajukenbo. -Uncle Willy still teaching? -Yeah, he's still teaching. He taught you. He taught me. [electronic music playing] [knock at door] Hey, bro, can you turn it down just a little bit? Hey, you good? Are you hungry? Hey, man, I lost my phone. Can I borrow your phone to call my phone? Fell out of my pocket. Thanks, bro. [electronic music continues playing] [David making squeaking noises] What are you doing? What are you doing? [electronic music continues] This. Hey, man, you are just listening to the same thing over and over again. Uh-huh. That's what I'm doing. Okay, cool. How's it going? Ah… You know I dig this shit, right? This is my kind of music, man. I can take some acid, I'll be out on the Playa. You know what I mean? All night long, but you, bro, you just… You are just in here. See, see here? Here, here, here, here. I'm just… If I could… See, there's all these things. All these things that I can… beat and time signature to fit with the n... If I can make it all sound… If I could make it sound the way it's supposed to sound, the way that it's meant to sound, then maybe I got a shot about understanding these things, these, man, I don't, I don't know. You are just going deeper and deeper into the abyss, man. Yes. Yeah, yeah 'cause… 'Cause t-that's where the answers might be, you know? [chuckles] Look, don't take it from me, okay? I mean, I ain't in here reading Nietzsche or playing with these computers, or, I don't know, meditating or whatever the fuck you do in here. But I gotta tell you something, bro. The answers ain't in here. I got you. I don't expect you to understand. It's cool, man. Fuck off, bro. Look, I do understand. But I just don't take shit so seriously. You know what I'm saying? I mean 'cause I looked for answers too, and I find it or I don't. You think I go to Burning Man just to be, like, partying all night and take hella drugs, but I'm finding myself, man. I'm finding myself. [sighs] I'm out there, man. I'm out there doing shit. Seeing shit. Fucking shit up for sure sometimes, but I am living. I know, I lost... I lost that. I-I don't have that. I… I'm not like you guys. Okay? I'm not... I don't have your heart or Dayo's strength or Duke's… What does that guy have again? Money. [laughs] Shit just works out for that fucking guy, man. I lost my heart. What do you mean, you don't have a heart, bro? You have the heart of a beast, man. Okay, you lost it. So fucking what, man? Go out there and get it back. Go assume the position or howl at the moon if you have to. [howls] Come on, man, do something. You gotta get out of this room and just... You know what? Say yes. Yes changes everything. It opens up possibilities that you wouldn't believe, man. Look, man, you're just… You're just a little down and confused, man, like your music. But you know what? You gonna get through it, man. I guess you're getting through it the only way you know how, bro. I respect that. I haven't lost faith in your heart.

You guys need to start supporting the Fil-Am. -Hey, Ma, I already sent a check in. -Yeah, for all of us, right? Look, it's not enough to donate money, okay? My generation is older now and the models are passing away. It's up to you guys to keep this going. I'm sorry, Mama, I got to… I can't make it I got a date. Oh, a date? Oh, I wanna know about that date. Tell us about it. -What'd he say? -I don't know. -Did he say he has a date? -I think he has a date. -Wow. -Yeah, wow. -This is good. -Yeah, it's good, but how? -I have no clue. -It's all good, baby. I found some more milk. Yeah, so, a date, huh? Yeah, she was… she… This girl, she wanted to meet up and she's really insistent. Oh yeah. -Yeah. -Hey, how'd you meet her? -Yeah, where did you meet this girl? -On my phone. -Your phone? -Yeah, it's an app. What, you're on a dating app? All right. How does that work? You know it's kind of like a… like a bar. Wait, a bar? -Virtually. -Yeah, virtually. Dude, it's like a bar, like, on your... You know how, like, a bar is like a watering hole, right? You go there, you meet people? Except it's on your phone. -Okay, a bar on my phone. -Is she cute? -That's good, right? -She's cute. Great, man, because you don't have to buy girls drinks. You just swipe, you connect, you know, you chat, you talk, you smash. I'm just going to go meet her. She wanted to meet? We're gonna meet. Okay, that's good. That's good, Danny boy. Getting out there, huh? Yo, David, you did this? It's cool, right? -It's hella cool. -Yeah, okay, yeah. I mean, it can't hurt. Help. That's what I do, man, help.

And I don't want to lie to you, which is why I didn't say it all on the app. I wanted you to get the full picture. -Okay. -Yeah. Okay, I see you. Yeah? You're beautiful.

You said you don't get out much. Why is that? I don't know. I haven't had the desire, I guess. Why? I don't know, to tell you the truth. You're depressed? Probably, yeah. Yes, I'm depressed. I'm… I don't even know what that means, exactly, but, yeah, I have been down for sure. Look, I don't mean to come at you, it's just… Fuck the small talk, you know? I'm trying to get to know you. Yeah, yeah, I know, I know. For some reason, with you it's all right, talking. I don't go for small talk either. Yeah, I could see that [chuckles]. [chips crunching] So what happened? I don't know. I got lost somewhere or just lost period, and I haven't found my way back yet. No, no, that sounds stupid. My girl fell in love with another man and she left me. She moved away to Michigan with our baby, Brandon. Made me promise to let her raise the new kid with a new man. He was one of my older brother Dayo's best friends, and he said he's a good guy, so at least there's that, right? [waitress] Are you ready to order? Could you just give us a minute? Thank you. I'm so sorry. That sounds terrible. I mean, you must be heartbroken. Broken? My heart is gone. I… Fuck my heart. I mean, I… I mean, I'd be fine, you know? If my mind and the rest of my body would just move on. I don't believe that. You're not the type to walk around in this world without a heart.

[soft music playing] Who are you? I'm just me. [laughs] Look, I know what it looks like, okay? But it was love, and sometimes love isn't supposed to last forever. Sometimes love exists just to create other things. Like life. Like new chapters. And, yeah, people can say what they want about me, but they don't know me. They don't know how it broke. How promises were… [sighs] And lies. And, yeah, okay, there's… It's "my fault," like, there's "my part," of course. But people, they don't know what really happened. And that's not what this date is about. Anyway, so. Hey, will you take me dancing? -Dancing? -Mm-hmm. -You wanna go to a club, now? -No, no, I don't, not really. I just… I… We're on this date, and I wanna do date stuff. I wanna go dancing. I can't drink, so I just wanna… Right. You want me to take you dancing? Yeah. Okay. Yeah? Cool, okay.

I know… I know I've been, I've been messed up in the head for a long time now, but, but… Dayo, you've been, you've been very kind to me, and I appreciate that, but I'm asking you, please, please be kind to her too, okay? Because… I fell in love with her. [Teresa giggling] Wow. -Okay. -[Teresa] That's sweet. This is awesome. -You motherfucker! -[mom screaming] -[Dayo shouts angrily] -Hey! -Wait! -[Dayo] Damn it! Goddamn it! [Mr. Abasta] What are you...? You guys are making fools of yourselves in front of this woman. That's okay, Mr. Abasta. When are you guys gonna grow up? Show some responsibility? I've had it with you guys. You boys think you rule everything. All I see is you running away. From your culture. From yourself. Do you think you have control over love? When it happens? Who it happens to? As if you have a say. But we know better, don't we? [laughs] Thank you. [sighs] He's a good man. A bit bruised, but he comes from good roots. You can't tell by all the commotion between his brothers, but if you can love him, who are we to judge? Yeah, bro, don't judge. [Dayo clicks teeth] -[yelps and groans] -[splat sound] [gasps] I think my water just broke. [groans] What? It's in my mouth. [Duke] She said she had Toni Braxton cramps! -Oh man, what are we going to do now? -Get Doris, she's a nurse. [tinkling upbeat music playing] These brothers, these fabulous Filipino brothers, are my brothers. Yeah, I'm the youngest, the sister. To which you say, "I didn't know they had a sister." And that's when I say, "Yes, story of my life." For a lot of families, especially Filipino families, it's all about the boys. And I admit, yes, in my life, it's been all about these boys. But while they're running around making a mess, make no mistake, it's the women in the family who hold it down. How far apart are the contractions? I don't know, I haven't been timing them. Ow! Ow! It's okay. You're gonna be okay, you just gotta breathe. -Okay, okay. -This is Teresa. I am Doris, I am the sister. Good one, David. Let's get her in the hospital. Get her up. Get her purse, David. [David] Why me? Why do I have to get the purse? -I'm not going to make it. -Stop, everybody. Turn it around. -On the table. -Clear the food. [Doris] Dayo, get the gloves! Danny boy, get some pillows! -Let's go. It's okay, I got you. -There's food here. [Doris] Slowly, slowly, slowly. There we go. There we go. -[Duke] Towels! -[David] I got the purse! -Here are the gloves. -You're late! -[Doris] Then you're gonna push. -[Teresa] Okay. -Here it comes. -Here it comes. -[Doris] And, push! -[all] Push! [all screaming] [soft music playing] [woman] Good job, Felix. [all] Cheese. [photographer] Okay, let's go, one crazy. [all cheering] [upbeat music playing] [inaudible] [all cheering] -Seven iron all day, I'll beat you. -David. -David. -What? -I'd like you to meet your cousin. -Cousin? Cousin's wife's sister on Tita Beverly's side. And she's recently divorced. What's up, cuz? ["All I need" by happy sad face playing] ♪ Do you want to make it better… ♪ [Berto] Where is my princess, my foxy princess? There she is, oh, looking like a Burmese Beyoncé, hey. -What the fuck are you doing here? -What do you mean? -Is that the way you greet me? -[second woman speaking Tagalog] -That's what I'm saying. -[speaking Tagalog] -I don't speak Manny Pacquiao. -Okay, Bert, come on, man. -[Doris] Excuse me, Bert! -[woman angrily speaking Tagalog] [Dayo] You said you weren't gonna be crazy. -Your breath smells like dolphin feet! -Shh! Grandma will hear! Dayo, you didn't ask your sister if you could invite him? [Berto] Oh, I thought it was cool. [Dayo] It's cool. Oh, hey, look, I got this for you. Come on. Oh, hey, look, I got this for you. Oh my gosh, is that circumcised? [Dayo laughing] Hey, Mr. Romance, how about a dance? What? Look there's something I have to tell you. Hey, hey, whatever you have to tell me, good or bad, Is it gonna make you a better father? Father? Oh. Babe. [narrator] Look I don't have the answers to what that brown bamboo fence looks like, or who gets to have it and who doesn't. To be honest, it's a bit too idealistic for me. I'm a single mom of two living with my girlfriend these days. Who would have thought? All I can do is keep following the example of Kuya Dayo, always taking care of his. Watch in awe as Duke becomes a father of his own, dance with David during a good family karaoke party, and see the rebirth of my brother Danny as a new sunlight enters his life. I said earlier that Filipinos are good at adapting. But now that I think about it, I think it's more about accepting. "Bahala na." Come what may.
