SPEAK CHILD, SHOW US YOUR GREAT LEARNING. MAMA... YOU HAVE NOTHING TO FEAR BUT GOD'S WRATH, MY LITTLE ONE, SO SPEAK. OUR FATHER... YES? THERE IS MORE. OUR FATHER, WHO ART IN HEAVEN, HALLOWED BE THY NAME. THY KINGDOM COME, THY WILL BE DONE AS IN HEAVEN, SO ON EARTH. GIVE US DAY BY DAY OUR DAILY BREAD, AND FORGIVE US OUR SINS: FOR WE ALSO FORGIVE EVERYONE THAT IS INDEBTED TO US... ENOUGH! I MOST SOLEMNLY FORBID YOU, CHILD, EVER AGAIN TO SPEAK THE CREED, THE LORD'S PRAYER, OR THE TEN COMMANDMENTS... IN ENGLISH! WE NEED HEAR NO MORE. THE MEN WILL BURN. BUT OF OUR GREAT COMPASSION AND MERCY, THE WIDOW WILL BE SPARED, TO PROVIDE FOR THIS BROOD - AFTER WE HAVE TAUGHT THEM AFRESH THE GODLY WAYS OF THE CHURCH. SEE THAT SHE IS SAFE HOME MOURTON. TAKE THE REST AWAY. WILLIAM, WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN, IT'S LATE. FORGIVE ME, LADY ANNE. THERE IS NOTHING TO FORGIVE - BUT YOU HAVE A VISITOR. FOR ME? COME AND SEE FOR YOURSELF. HE WILL BE DINING WITH US, AND FROM THE LOOK OF HIM, I WOULD SAY HIS APPETITE IS DULLED ONLY BY HIS EAGERNESS TO SEE YOU. A FRIEND? THAT I WILL TELL YOU, AND NO MORE. ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH THE NAME THOMAS POYNTZ? NO SIR. A MERCHANT IN LONDON, KINSMAN TO MY WIFE, A COUSIN OR SOME SUCH. NOW HE IS A MAN OF YOUR PERSUASION - TALKS ENDLESSLY OF ERASMUS AND LUTHER AND THE 'NEW LEARNING' AS HE CALLS IT. LONDON IS SOME MILES FROM CAMBRIDGE, SIR JOHN. I KNOW THAT... BUT THE WORLD GROWS SMALLER WITH THE PASSING OF THE DAYS, AND THE WORLD OF LEARNING GROWS LARGER WITHIN IT. WHY EVEN HERE IN THE COTWOLDS WE... JOHN! WILLIAM! AT LAST! INDEED 'AT LAST'. A MAN COULD DIE FOR WANT OF NOURISHMENT. LADY ANNE SAYS YOU WILL STAY TO DINE. AND NOT TO DINE ONLY, BUT ALSO TO LODGE A NIGHT OR TWO. SAY YOU WILL. I WILL. "BUT SIRE," I SAID, "YOUR HORSE IS THE LARGEST IN ALL ENGLAND. IF HANNIBAL HAD OWNED SUCH MOUNTS HE WOULD HAVE TAKEN ROME." TO ME IT WAS A JEST BUT TO THE KING A CHALLENGE. "VERY WELL, THEN SIR," HE BELLOWED, "WE WILL CHANGE MOUNTS AND RACE AGAIN." AND DID YOU? AYE, I MUST OBEY THE KING - BUT THERE'S THE RUB. THOUGH IT WERE POLITIC TO LOSE, OUGHT I TO LOSE ON THE FASTEST, FINEST HORSE IN ALL ENGLAND? WHAT SAY YOU? IF YOU WIN, YOU INJURE THE KING. IF YOU LOSE, YOU INJURE HIS HORSE. SURELY, IT WERE BETTER TO LOSE. AYE, WELL WE RACED AND I WON - AND THE KING CLAPPED ME ON THE SHOULDER AND SAID "YOU WILL BE MY CHAMPION." THOUGH THE KING WAS BUT SEVENTEEN YEARS OF AGE. AND I BUT TWENTY TWO AND HALF AS STRONG AS HE. WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE DONE WILLIAM? LOST OR WON? NEITHER ONE NOR THE OTHER. BETWEEN ME AND A HORSE, I LIKE A LARGE CART OR A LONG DISTANCE. (WILLIAM) HE IS A GOOD AND KIND MAN. BUT HIS CHILDREN HAVE NO NEED OF A TUTOR! (JOHN) PERHAPS IN YEARS TO COME, BUT NOW...? SO WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE ME DO? RETURN WITH ME, YOU HAVE MUCH TO GIVE, ENCOURAGEMENT TO OFFER. YOU HAVE FAITH AND WISDOM. WHY WOULD YOU ROB US OF THAT? WHY ROB YOURSELF OF THE FELLOWSHIP? AND THE WHEELWRIGHT? THE BLACKSMITH? THE PLOUGHMAN? ARE THEY BETTER ROBBED? WHAT OF THIS MAN HERE, WHERE WILL HE FIND CHRIST? WILL THE PRIESTS SHOW HIM, OR THE FRIARS? THEY ARE AS LOST AS HE, PRAYING TO THE SAINTS WITH WORDS BEYOND THEIR UNDERSTANDING. SO YOU WILL REMAIN? HERE ON THE EDGE OF THE WORLD, TO TEACH THE PLOUGHMAN? MOSES WAS 40 LONG YEARS IN THE WILDERNESS BEFORE HE KNEW WHAT GOD WOULD HAVE HIM DO. BEFORE I WOULD TEACH HIS WORD I MUST LEARN IT. AND THEN? IT WAS IN THE LANGUAGE OF ISRAEL THAT THE PSALMS WERE SUNG IN THE TEMPLE OF JEHOVAH. WHY SHOULD THE GOSPEL SPEAK TO ENGLAND IN LATIN THE LANGUAGE OF ANCIENT ROME? I SHALL BRING THE SCRIPTURES TO ENGLAND FOR ENGLISHMEN TO READ. AND THE LORD GOD SPOKE THROUGH HIS PROPHET JEREMIAH AND SAID THAT A HORRIBLE THING HAD HAPPENED IN THE LAND. THE PROPHETS PROPHESY LIES, HE SAID, AND THE PRIESTS RULE BY THEIR OWN AUTHORITY. AND THIS WAS ISRAEL, GOD'S CHOSEN PEOPLE, PLUCKED FROM THE BONDAGE OF EGYPT AND BROUGHT TO THE PROMISED LAND. THE PRIESTS RULED BY THEIR OWN AUTHORITY! AND WHAT CAN WE SAY OF ENGLAND, NOW? WHAT CAN WE SAY OF OUR COARSE MONKS, OUR GREEDY PRIESTS, AND OUR POMPOUS PRELATES? THEIRS IS NOT THE GOSPEL OF CHRIST BUT A TRADE - AND A PROFITABLE TRADE AT THAT! THINK OF IT. THEY WANT MONEY FOR EVERYTHING: THEY WANT MONEY FOR BAPTISMS, MONEY FOR CHURCHINGS, MONEY FOR WEDDINGS, FOR BURYINGS, FOR PENANCES FOR SOUL MASSES, FOR CHALICES, FOR BELLS... THOSE ARE FOR THE GLORY OF GOD. WOULD YOU SO CHEAPEN SALVATION AS TO OFFER IT WITHOUT A SACRIFICE? AS THE PSALMIST DECLARED, THE SACRIFICES OF GOD ARE A BROKEN SPIRIT AND A CONTRITE HEART. WOULD THIS MAN MOCK ME BEFORE THIS CROWD? YOU POOR SHEEP! THE PARSON SHEARS, THE VICAR SHAVES, THE PRIEST SCRAPES, THE FRIAR PARES... ALL WE LACK IS A BUTCHER TO TEAR OFF THE SKIN. WHY ARE THE PRELATES DRESSED IN RED? HUH? IT IS MEANT TO SHOW THAT THEY ARE READY EVERY HOUR TO SUFFER MARTYRDOM FOR THE TESTIMONY OF GOD'S WORD. FOR GOD'S WORD! IF ANY MAN HERE SO MUCH AS UTTER ONE QUESTION CONCERNING GOD'S WORD THEY ARE READY EVERY HOUR TO BURN HIM! HE MUST BE STOPPED! BEHOLD, THE DAY IS COME, SAITH THE LORD GOD, WHEN I WILL BRING A FAMINE IN THE LAND. NOT A FAMINE OF BREAD, NOT A THIRST FOR WATER BUT OF HEARING THE WORDS OF THE LORD. THEY ARE LOOKING TO TRAP YOU WILLIAM - AND THEY SHALL. YOU MUST TAKE CARE. YES. PEOPLE HAVE BEEN BURNED, WILLIAM. SIMPLE, GOOD, HONEST FOLK. BURNED. AND FOR WHAT? FOR TEACHING THEIR CHILDREN THE LORD'S PRAYER. IN ENGLISH! DOES IT NOT TROUBLE YOU? THEY SHALL HAVE A BETTER RESURRECTION. THEY TAUGHT THEIR CHILDREN THE LORD'S PRAYER AND WERE BURNED. YOU WOULD GIVE THE NATION THE WHOLE SCRIPTURE! WHAT WILL THEY DO TO YOU? DO YOU HAVE NO FEAR? YES, AND I MOST FEAR HIM WHO HAS THE POWER TO DESTROY THE SOUL. NOTHING I SAY WILL CHANGE YOU. I WOULD ASK ONLY THAT YOU WALK CAREFULLY. ARCHEGOS...THE FIRST ONE... THE BEGINNING ONE. THE ONE WHO MAKES IT BEGIN... THE BEGINNER. THE BEGINNER AND FINISHER OF OUR FAITH! (WILLIAM THINKING) IF I SAY BEGINNER AND FINISHER, THE READER WILL BELIEVE THERE IS AN ENDING TO OUR FAITH, WHEN TO OUR FAITH THERE IS NO ENDING. TELEIOTES IS ONE WHO COMPLETES, BUT NOT ONE WHO ENDS. TELEIOTES IS A FINE CRAFTSMAN WHO COMPLETES HIS WORK. A POET, PERHAPS, WHO HAVING BROUGHT HIS ART INTO BEING NOW BRINGS A PERFECT... FINISH...TO IT. AND ARCHEGOS? THE BEGINNING ONE... THE CREATOR? THE AUTHOR!! THE AUTHOR AND FINISHER OF OUR FAITH. LET US RUN WITH PATIENCE UNTO THE BATTLE THAT IS SET BEFORE US, LOOKING UNTO JESUS THE AUTHOR AND FINISHER OF OUR FAITH. WILLIAM... FORGIVE ME, I STARTLED YOU. YOU SEEM TROUBLED. I HAVE A LETTER FOR YOU. IT CARRIES THE SEAL OF THE ARCHDEACON. BAD NEWS? I WOULD THINK SO. FOR SOME TIME NOW THERE HAS BEEN CRITICISM OF YOU AMONG THE PRIESTS AND FRIARS. I FEAR WHAT JOHN BELL WILL HAVE TO SAY. LET US READ IT AND LEARN WHAT WE HAVE TO FEAR. I AM SUMMONED TO APPEAR BEFORE THE ARCHDEACON TO ANSWER A CHARGE OF HERESY. HOW WILL YOU ANSWER? MR. TYNDALE, YOU HAVE BEEN ACCUSED OF HERESY, IN ARGUMENT, IN LOGIC AND IN DIVINITY. AND I WILL ANSWER THE CHARGES IF YOU CAN BRING JUST ONE WITNESS TO SHOW WHERE I HAVE ERRED. I WILL TESTIFY THAT YOU DID SPREAD OUT THE SCRIPTURES NAKEDLY BEFORE THE PEOPLE. AND I WILL ANSWER THAT I DID EXPOUND THE WORD OF GOD THAT THEY MIGHT FIND CHRIST. THE WORD OF GOD! WHY EVEN WE ARE UNABLE TO EXPLAIN IT. HOW THEN CAN THE COMMON PEOPLE? IT IS A MYSTERY ONLY TO THOSE WHO READ IT WITHOUT CHRIST. THAT IS WHY IT IS AN OBSCURE BOOK TO YOU. NOTHING IS OBSCURE TO US! IT IS WE WHO EXPLAIN THE SCRIPTURES TO YOU. THEN YOU ARE WASTING BOTH YOUR TIME AND YOUR TROUBLE. FAR FROM EXPLAINING THE SCRIPTURES, IT IS YOU WHO HAVE HIDDEN THEM. YOU WHO BURN THOSE WHO TEACH THEM, WHY, IF YOU COULD, YOU WOULD BURN THE VERY WORD OF GOD ITSELF. ENOUGH! PLEASE! WE ARE NOT HERE TO DEBATE. MR. TYNDALE, IT IS WRITTEN IN THE SCRIPTURE THAT THE PEOPLE SHOULD BE SUBJECT TO THE RULERS AND AUTHORITIES AND SHOULD OBEY THE MAGISTRATES. WHAT YOU ARE DOING IS OUTSIDE THE LAW OF ENGLAND. IF YOU DENY THAT LAW IT FOLLOWS THAT YOU DENY THE SCRIPTURES. I WOULD THEREFORE ASK, FIRST, IF YOU OFFEND THE LAW, CAN ANY GOOD COME OF IT? HOWEVER WELL YOU MEAN? SECONDLY, I WOULD COUNCEL THAT THOUGH HE HAVE FRIENDS IN HIGH PLACES, EVEN SIR JOHN WALSH IS NOT ABOVE THE LAW. AND, THIRDLY, I WOULD CHARGE YOU MOST SOLEMNLY, THAT WHEN YOU GO FROM THIS PLACE, YOU WILL OBEY THE LAW - AND SPEAK NO MORE HERESY. NOW GO... YOU PRAY TO THE SAINTS. YOU MAKE IMAGES OF THEM. YOU LIGHT CANDLES TO THEM. IF THESE IMAGES CAN SEE AND HEAR, PERHAPS THEY HUNGER ALSO... AHH! AND IF THEY HUNGER, WHY DO YOU NOT MAKE THEIR BELLIES HOLLOW AND PUT FOOD AND DRINK INSIDE? JEST IS ILL-BECOMING IN ONE SO YOUNG. HIS MIND IS FULL OF INVENTION. AND PROFANITY. WOULD YOU MAKE A MOCKERY OF SACRED IMAGES? NO MORE WOULD I THAN DID THE PROPHET ISAIAH. HE WROTE OF THE MAN WHO CUT DOWN A TREE TO LIGHT A FIRE TO MAKE SOME BREAD. AND WHEN HE WAS WARMED AND FILLED HE TOOK THE REMAINS OF THAT WOOD AND CARVED AN IMAGE. THEN HE FELL BEFORE IT AND WORSHIPPED, AND SAID: YOU ARE MY GOD, DELIVER ME. DID ISAIAH LAUGH WHEN HE WROTE THAT? DID ISAIAH WRITE THAT? YOU ARE A PRIEST, TUTORED IN THE CLASSICS AT CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY. IF YOU, LEARNED AS WE SUPPOSED YOU ARE, SCHOOLED IN GREEK AND LATIN AND DIVINITY, PRACTICED IN THE ARTS OF DEBATE AND CONTENTION - IF YOU CANNOT UNDERSTAND ISAIAH OR THE SCRIPTURES YOU SO IMPRUDENTLY EXPOUND, HOW THEN CAN THE IGNORANT LAITY? THE BLACKSMITH, THE WEAVER, THE PLOUGHBOY? THOSE WHO COUNT UPON THEIR FINGERS AND LOOK TO US TO GUIDE THEM? ONE MOMENT, DOCTOR. AS OUR LORD SAID: 'HOTAN DE ALTHE EKEINOS, TO PNEUMA TES..." OH SPARE US, SPARE US! I ACKNOWLEDGED YOUR LEARNING. MUST YOU PARADE IT BEFORE US? I THOUGHT PERHAPS TRANSLATION MIGHT CAUSE OFFENSE. YOUR VERY PRESENCE AT THIS TABLE CAUSES OFFENCE - WHICH WE ENDURE FOR THE SAKE OF OUR HOST AND OUR GRACIOUS HOSTESS... IF OUR LORD SPOKE, WOULD IT NOT BE BETTER TO HEAR IT IN ENGLISH? WOULD THAT ALL ENGLAND COULD HEAR IF IN ENGLISH. DAMN YOUR IMPERTINENCE! WHAT DID HE SAY? WHEN HE, THE SPIRIT OF TRUTH IS COME, HE WILL GUIDE YOU INTO ALL TRUTH. AND THAT, YOUNG TYNDALE, IS WHAT THE SPIRIT DOES - THROUGH THE CHURCH! BUT THE CHURCH HAS SO MANY PERSUASIONS. ONE MAN FOLLOWS DUNS SCOTIUS, ANOTHER THOMAS AQUINAS, ANOTHER BONAVENTURE. IF ALL THESE LEARNED MEN ARE IN CONTRADICTION ONE WITH EACH OTHER, HOW CAN WE KNOW RIGHT FROM WRONG - BUT BY GOD'S WORD? GOD'S WORD SAYS "IF THINK EYE OFFENDS THEE, PLUCK IT OUT." GIVE THE SCRIPTURES TO IGNORANT MEN AND THEY'LL SOON BE TEARING OUT THEIR OWN EYES HITHER AND YON. WE'LL BE A NATION OF BLIND MEN. WITHOUT GOD'S WORD, WE ARE A NATION OF BLIND MEN. BUT WITHOUT THE HELP OF DOCTORS, GOD'S WORD IS TOO HARD TO UNDERSTAND. AND THAT IS TO MEASURE THE YARDSTICK BY THE CLOTH. THERE ARE AS MANY DOCTORS AS THERE ARE PIECES OF CLOTH, BUT ONLY ONE YARDSTICK OF SCRIPTURE. BY WHAT SHOULD WE MEASURE THAT? BY THE POPE! THE POPE, WHOM GOD HAS SET ON EARTH IN DIRECT SUCCESSION FROM THE APOSTLE PETER. THE POPE THROUGH WHOM GOD ADMINISTERS TRUTH AND JUSTICE! THE POPE! THE POPE! AND WHAT IF THE POPE IS AT VARIANCE WITH GOD'S LAWS? THEN IT WERE BETTER TO DO WITHOUT GOD'S LAWS THAN THE POPE'S. WELL, YOUNG SIR, WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THAT. I DEFY THE POPE AND ALL HIS LAWS. IF GOD SPARES MY LIFE, I WILL SEE TO IT THAT A PLOUGHBOY SHALL KNOW MORE OF THE SCRIPTURES THAN YOU DO. FORGIVE ME, LADY ANNE, I WILL NOT SIT AT TABLE WITH BLASPHEMERS AND HERETICS. NO MORE SHALL I. NO, PLEASE WAIT... I WILL NOT SPOIL THE MEAL. I SHALL GO TO MY ROOM. YOU WILL STAY WHERE YOU ARE. I SHALL CONDUCT YOU TO MY DOOR. YOUR HOSPITALITY IS RENOWNED, YOUR TABLE UNSURPASSED, AND WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR KINDNESS. TAKE HEED YOUNG MAN. THERE ARE FIRES ON EARTH AND THERE ARE FIRES IN HELL. TAKE CARE THAT THE ONE IS NOT NEEDFUL TO SPARE YOU THE OTHER. FORGIVE ME, LADY ANNE. OH WILLIAM... WHAT CAN I SAY? IF YOUR LIFE WERE NOT SO ABOVE REPROACH IT WOULD BE EASY. NO MAN'S LIFE IS ABOVE REPROACH. BUT I'M AFRAID. AFRAID FOR YOU, FOR MYSELF, FOR MY CHILDREN. IS YOUR POSITION NOT SECURE? JOHN IS A FRIEND OF THE KING. AT HIS CORONATION HE WAS HIS CHAMPION. BUT THE KING IS RULED BY MANY THINGS - HIS COUNSEL, HIS CHANCELLOR, HIS PASSIONS, THE SIGHT OF HIS FACE IN THE GLASS... NOBODY IS SECURE. WELL DONE YOUNG WILLIAM. WE ARE WELL RID OF THEM. IT WAS NOT MY INTENTION TO... DON'T TARNISH IT BY TELLING ME WHAT YOUR INTENTIONS WERE. YOU HAVE MORE LEARNING IN YOUR LITTLE FINGER THAN ALL THOSE DOCTORS COULD EVER HOPE FOR. I WAS MUCH AMUSED. BUT, THE FOX IS NOW AMONG THE CHICKENS AND SOON THE FEATHERS WILL FLY. THEY WILL NOT FORGIVE YOU, AND I CANNOT PROMISE YOU PROTECTION. SO, WOULD YOU HAVE ME LEAVE? NO, NO, NO. IF YOU CAN DEFY THE POPE HIMSELF, I CAN DEFY A FEW UNTUTORED CLERICS. IF YOUR GOD WOULD HAVE YOU STAY, THEN I'LL NOT BID YOU LEAVE. HOW CAN I HELP YOU YOUNG WILLIAM. WHAT TROUBLES YOU? THE SCRIPTURES SPEAK WITH ONE VOICE, BUT OLDER MEN THAN I, AND WISER, SEEM TO SPEAK WITH ANOTHER. THEN THEY ARE SURELY WRONG. BUT MAKE NO MISTAKE, NOT ALL WITHIN THE CHURCH ARE WRONG. ENGLAND HAS ITS WITNESS. I WISH THAT ENGLAND HAD THE SCRIPTURES. THEN DO IT. IT IS WITHIN YOUR GIFT. WITHIN MY GIFT, YET WITHOUT THE LAW. UNLESS YOU HAVE THE AUTHORITY OF A BISHOP. BUT WHAT BISHOP IN ENGLAND WOULD DEFY THE AUTHORITY OF THE POPE. THERE IS NONE. BUT ONE, AT LEAST, IS KNOWN TO HAVE BEFRIENDED ERASMUS. CUTHBERT TUNSTALL! GO TO THE BISHOP OF LONDON. IF GOD WILL HAVE YOU PROSPER THEN YOU WILL PROSPER. BUT TAKE CARE WHAT YOU SAY. HE HAS A BROAD MIND, BUT OTHERS HAVE NOT. IF IT IS SEEN THAT YOU ARE OF AN EVANGELICAL PERSUASION IT COULD COST YOU DEAR. THIS IS A LETTER OF INTRODUCTION TO SIR HENRY GUILDFORD - CONTROLLER OF THE KING'S HOUSEHOLD. IF YOU WISH TO MEET BISHOP TUNSTALL... SIR JOHN, I WISH FOR NOTHING MORE. IF HE WILL ONLY SEE ME AND GRANT ME LICENSE... SEE HIM YOU WILL, BUT SIR HENRY CANNOT MOVE THE BISHOP'S MIND - YOU MUST DO THAT. THANK YOU, SIR JOHN. THIS IS THE ADDRESS OF MY COUSIN, THOMAS POYNTZ. HIS HOUSE IS SMALL, BUT YOU WILL BE VERY WELCOME UNTIL YOU FIND ACCOMMODATION. IF THE BISHOP'S PALACE PERHAPS. YOU ARE VERY KIND. YOU HAVE BROUGHT JOY TO OUR HOUSE FOR THE PAST TWO YEARS. NOW IT WILL SEEM VERY EMPTY. GOD BE WITH YOU WILLIAM. WILLIAM, MAY I INTRODUCE HUMPHREY MONMOUTH. HUMPHREY IS A MERCHANT AND A SCRIPTURE MAN. WILLIAM WAS TUTOR TO MY COUSIN'S CHILDREN IN GLOUCESTERSHIRE. YOUR GOOD NAME HAS GONE BEFORE YOU. WHERE ARE YOU LODGING. WITH THOMAS AND HIS WIFE - UNTIL I CAN FIND A ROOM. THEN YOU NEED LOOK NO FURTHER. MY HOUSE IS LARGE - ANY MAN WHO PREACHES AS WELL AS YOU IS WELCOME IN IT. WE ARE MANY, BUT CAREFUL. THAT MAN THERE, WHAT DO YOU SEE? A MAN WITH THE STRENGTH OF AN OX. AND THE FAITH OF A LITTLE CHILD. HARRY! THOMAS TALKS OF YOUR PURPOSES - OF YOUR LEANING IN GREEK - THAT YOU WOULD GIVE THE SCRIPTURES TO ENGLISHMEN. IF GOD WILLS. WOULD GOD WILL THAT HIS WORD BE NOT READ? WYCLIFFE TRANSLATED THE SCRIPTURES, BUT FEW IN ENGLAND HAVE THEM. PERHAPS GOD WOULD HAVE US HUNGER FOR HIS WORD BEFORE HE FEEDS US. THE PEOPLE ARE HUNGRY NOW. LOOK... LUTHER. IT IS GOOD IT IS PRECIOUS, AND THE WORD IS IN IT, BUT IT IS NOT THE WORD. DO MANY BOOKS COME TO ENGLAND LIKE THIS? SECRETLY, AYE. BY THE SCORE. BUT I SAY AGAIN, WE ARE CAREFUL. MEN HAVE BURNED FOR LESS. MESSAGE, SIR. WILLIAM, IT'S COME - WORD FROM TUNSTALL. THE BISHOP WILL SEE YOU TOMORROW. THANK GOD! PERHAPS YOU ARE RIGHT, HUMPHREY. PERHAPS NOW THE PEOPLE ARE HUNGRY ENOUGH. AH, TYNDALE, COME IN, COME IN - SIT DOWN. THANK YOU, YOUR GRACE. SIR HENRY GUILDFORD HAS SHOWN ME THIS. AN ORATION OF ISOCRATES, TRANSLATED FROM GREEK TO LATIN. IS IT YOURS? IT IS, YOUR GRACE. IT SPEAKS WELL OF YOUR LEARNING. AS, INDEED, SIR HARRY SPEAKS WELL OF YOUR CONVERSATION AND GODLY MANNER. WHAT DO YOU REQUIRE OF ME? I WOULD ENTER YOUR EMPLOY, AS CHAPLAIN, YOUR GRACE. AND PASS YOUR TIME IN SCHOLARLY PURSUITS AND CLASSICAL TRANSLATIONS. YOU HAVE A GIFT FOR LANGUAGE I CANNOT DENY. WHAT MAY I ASK, COMMEND ME TO YOU? ERASMUS SPEAKS OF YOU AS THE FIRST ENGLISHMAN IN GREEK AND LATIN. IT WAS THROUGH THE GREEK TESTAMENT OF ERASMUS THAT I FOUND CHRIST. THEN ERASMUS SHOULD BE COMMENDED. TELL ME, IF YOU WERE TO BE FOUND IN MY EMPLOY, WHAT WORK OF TRANSLATION WOULD YOU UNDERTAKE? LATIN? THAT OF THE TESTAMENT, YOUR GRACE... FROM GREEK TO ENGLISH. AND FOR THAT YOU WOULD REQUIRE MY PATRONAGE, MY EPISCOPAL AUTHORITY. YES, YOUR GRACE. YES...MMM... A WORTHY WORK. NOT EVERY PRIEST HAS THE SAME GIFT OF LANGUAGE AS YOU AND I. AND MOST WOULD PROFIT FROM AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE SCRIPTURES. I WOULD WISH THE TESTAMENT TO BE READ BY EVERYONE, AND NOT BY THE CLERGY ONLY. IN TIME PERHAPS. IN TIME. CONSIDER THE SEASONS, YOUNG TYNDALE - HOW THEY CHANGE. WINTER TURNS TO SUMMER SLOWLY, THROUGH THE MANY SHADES OF SPRING. THE PEOPLE ARE HUNGRY FOR THE WORD OF TRUTH NOW. THAT SAME WORD OF TRUTH DECLARES THAT MEAT IS NOT FOR BABES BUT FOR THOSE WHO ARE STRONG ENOUGH TO BEAR IT. WHEN THE CHURCH HAS GROWN TO MANHOOD THEN SHALL WE FEED THEM. THE SCRIPTURE ALSO URGES THAT WE SHOULD DESIRE THE SINCERE MILK OF THE WORD THAT WE MIGHT GROW THEREBY. WE DO NOT STARVE A BABY OF MILK BECAUSE IT CANNOT EAT MEAT. YOU ARGUE WELL, AND I AGREE WITH MUCH OF WHAT YOU SAY. MOREOVER, THERE ARE MANY WITHIN THE CHURCH WHO WOULD, I BELIEVE, WELCOME A... GENTLE CHANGE. BUT... YOU KNOW OF COURSE, OF WYCLIFFE AND HIS LOLLARD FOLLOWERS? AND YOU HAVE CONSIDERED WELL HOW THE LAITY TOOK HOLD OF THE SCRIPTURE AND USED IT TO DISHONOR THE CHURCH? I DO NOT HOLD THAT THE SCRIPTURE... THERE WAS DISORDER, CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE AND GODLESSNESS. BUT THE APOSTLE SAID GOD'S WORD WAS QUICK AND POWERFUL - AND OUR LORD HIMSELF DECLARED THAT HE HAD COME TO BRING NOT PEACE, BUT A SWORD... I AM SORRY. MY HOUSE IS FULL. I HAVE ALREADY MORE PEOPLE THAN I CAN EMPLOY... HOWEVER, I AM SURE THAT IF YOU LOOK ABOUT LONDON YOU WILL NOT FAIL TO MEET WITH SUITABLE EMPLOYMENT. AH, NOW HERE'S A QUESTION... WILLIAM? WILLIAM, YOU MUST WORK. TO WHAT END? I HAVE AMUSED YOU? YOU ARE A MERE MAN. THAT IS GOOD. THERE HAVE BEEN TIMES WHEN I THOUGHT YOU TO BE AN ANGEL. WILLIAM...CAN THE BISHOP OF LONDON STAND IN THE WAY OF GOD'S WILL? WHAT IS GOD'S WILL? HIS WILL IS HIS COMMAND - AND HIS COMMAND IS THAT WE SHOULD PREACH THE GOSPEL OF CHRIST. IT AVAILS NOTHING IF THE WORD IS OFFERED IN A FOREIGN TONGUE. THERE ARE OTHER BISHOPS WITH AUTHORITY. EKKLESIA. THOSE WHO ARE CALLED OUT. YOU HAVE USED THE WORD 'CONGREGATION'. YES. YET THE MEANING WOULD SIGNIFY 'CHURCH'. AND 'CHURCH' WOULD SIGNIFY THE MULTITUDE OF SHAVEN, SHORN AND OILED, WHICH WE NOW CALL THE CLERGY. THE WORD 'EKKLESIA'... 'EKKLESIA'... IS COMMON TO ALL THE CONGREGATION WHO BELIEVE IN CHRIST. FORGIVE ME. WHERE ARE YOU GOING? TO SPEAK WITH HUMPHREY. HE HAS MADE APPROACHES TO CERTAIN PRINTERS. YOU WOULD PRINT WITHOUT A LICENSE? AFTER TUNSTALL THERE IS NONE WHO WOULD GRANT IT. SHALL A MERE LICENSE STAND IN THE WAY OF GOD'S WILL? I AM GRAVE, WILLIAM. I HAVE PASSED THE DAY TALKING TO PRINTERS, EVERY MAN IN LONDON WHO PRINTS. I HAVE BEEN A NUISANCE TO ALL OF THEM. ARE THEY ALL WITHOUT FAITH? BY NO MEANS. SOME ARE WITH US. BUT NOT A MAN, WILL PRINT THE SCRIPTURES WITHOUT AUTHORITY. AND IF THERE BE NONE IN LONDON, THERE IS NONE IN ENGLAND. THEN I SHALL GO TO GERMANY AND PRINT IT THERE. IF LUTHER'S BOOKS CAN FIND THEIR WAY TO ENGLAND, SO SHALL MINE. COME, WILL, YOU'VE READ IT A DOZEN TIMES OR MORE. AND STILL I AM NOT HAPPY. THAT IS BECAUSE YOU ARE OF A CONTENTIOUS DISPOSITION. AND BECAUSE YOUR TRANSLATION ARGUES WITH ITSELF. WHILST LIVING MOST AGREEABLY WITH THE GREEK. COME, PETER QUENTEL IS EXPECTING US. HOW CAN IT LIVE MOST AGREEABLE WITH THE GREEK - WHEN TO ONE GREEK WORD YOU ASCRIBE SEVERAL ENGLISH MEANINGS? WHY IN ONE PLACE, DOES 'IDOU' MEAN 'BEHOLD', AND IN ANOTHER IT MEANS 'LO' - AND YET AGAIN 'LOOK', OR 'SEE'? WHAT GREEK WORD WOULD YOU USE FOR 'BEHOLD'? IDOU. AND FOR 'LO'? WELL, 'IDOU', BUT... AND WOULD YOU CHOOSE DIFFERENTLY FOR 'LOOK', WERE THE SENSE THE SAME? NO... THEN THE TRANSLATION IS SOUND AND THE READING OF IT ENRICHED. IF WE ARE FAITHFUL TO GOD'S WORD WE HAVE NO CAUSE TO WEARY THOSE WHO WOULD READ IT. THE ENGLISH HAVE A LANGUAGE WHICH IS RICH AND BEAUTIFUL AND BLESSED WITH INFINITE VARIETY. WHY THEN CAN WE NOT USE IT ALL? GOOD MORNING, HERR QUENTEL. IF YOU SAY SO MR. TYNDALE. THOUGH I PRINTED JUST THIS MORNING THAT THE DAYS ARE EVIL, SO WE SHOULD REDEEM THE TIME. YOU READ MY TRANSLATION? I COULD SCARE PRINT IT OTHERWISE. IT IS AN AFFLICTION I MUST BEAR IF I WOULD PURSUE MY TRADE. MR. QUENTEL, EVERY BLESSING IS TO YOU A CAUSE FOR COMPLAINT. WHERE IS YOUR MORNING'S WORK? UNDER THOSE SACKS THERE, CONCEALED. IF YOU WANT YOUR BOOKS DISPLAYED, YOU SHOULD WORK IN HAMBURG, NOT IN COLOGNE... AND ROB YOU OF GOOD TRADE? OR WITTENBERG. THERE ARE MANY CITIES IN GERMANY WHICH WOULD WELCOME YOUR HERESIES. I STAYED NIGH ON A YEAR IN HAMBURG, AND WITTENBERG WAS WHERE I MET MY GOOD AND FAITHFUL FRIEND WILLIAM ROYE. GOOD DAY TO YOU, SIR. AND THE 'HERESY' OF WHICH YOU SPEAK IS THE GOSPEL OF CHRIST. SO YOU SAY, SIR. BUT I SHALL TRUST MY PRIEST. HE IS, LIKE ME, A GOOD CRAFTSMAN WHO CHARGES LITTLE. AND CHRIST IS THE MASTER CRAFTSMAN WHOSE WORK IS OFFERED FREE. ARE THESE NOW FINISHED? DONE BUT NOR DRY, SIR. OH... MMM...IT READS WELL: THOUGH I SPEAK WITH THE TONGUES OF MEN AND ANGELS AND YET HAVE NO LOVE, I WERE EVEN AS A SOUNDING BRASS OR A TINKLING CYMBAL. AND THOUGH I COULD PROPHESY AND UNDERSTOOD ALL SECRETS AND ALL KNOWLEDGE... YEA, IF I HAVE ALL FAITH SO THAT I COULD MOVE MOUNTAINS OUT OF THEIR PLACES... AND YET HAD NO LOVE, I WERE NOTHING. AND THOUGH I BESTOWED ALL MY GOODS TO FEED THE POOR, AND THOUGH I GAVE MY BODY EVEN THAT I BURNED AND YET HAVE NO LOVE, IT PROFITETH ME NOTHING. LOVE SUFFERETH LONG AND IS COURTEOUS. LOVE ENVIETH NOT. LOVE DOTH NOT FORWARDLY, SWELLETH NOT, DEALTH NOT DISHONESTLY, SEEKETH NOT HER OWN, IS NOT PROVOKED TO ANGER, THINKETH NOT EVIL, REJOICETH NOT IN INIQUITY, BUT REJOICETH IN THE TRUTH, SUFFERETH ALL THINGS, BELIEVETH ALL THINGS, HOPETH ALL THINGS, ENDURETH ALL THINGS. THOUGH THAT PROPHESYINGS FAIL, OTHER TONGUES SHALL CEASE OR KNOWLEDGE VANISHETH AWAY; YET LOVE FALLETH NEVER AWAY. FOR OUR KNOWLEDGE IS IMPERFECT AND OUR PROPHESYING IS IMPERFECT, BUT WHEN THAT WHICH IS PERFECT IS COME: THEN THAT WHICH IS IMPERFECT SHALL BE DONE AWAY. WHEN I WAS A CHILD I IMAGINED AS A CHILD: BUT AS SOON AS I WAS A MAN I PUT AWAY ALL CHILDISHNESS. NOW WE SEE IN A GLASS EVEN IN A DARK SPEAKING, BUT THEN SHALL WE SEE FACE TO FACE. NOW I KNOW IMPERFECTLY: BUT THEN SHALL I KNOW EVEN AS I AM KNOWN. NOW ABIDETH FAITH, HOPE AND LOVE, EVEN THESE THREE. BUT THE CHIEF OF THESE IS LOVE. SENATOR RINCKE, I FLED FRANKFURT BECAUSE THE HERETICS THERE WERE RUNNING WILD. FORGIVE ME IF I SEEM A LITTLE NERVOUS. NERVOUS? OF ME? I HAVE AN AGED MOTHER AND A SMALL NIECE STILL IN FRANKFURT. YOU NEED NOT FEAR FOR THEM. THIS IS COLOGNE, HERR COCHLAEUS. WE HAVE BEEN SPARED THE LUTHERAN MADNESS AND SO LONG AS THERE IS BREATH IN MY BODY, SO SHALL WE BE. NOW,TELL ME, WHAT IS THIS YOU HAVE LEARNED? TWO ENGLISHMEN ARE HERE IN THIS CITY. THIS THE WORK ON WHICH THEY ARE ENGAGED. FINE CRAFTSMANSHIP. WHAT IS IT? IT IS A LETTER OF ST. PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS. I FOUND THIS SAMPLE IN THE PRINTING WORKS OF PETER QUENTEL. BY CHANCE? BY CHANCE I SPOKE WITH CERTAIN EMPLOYEES OF HERR QUENTEL AND ONE, WITH A LITTLE TOO MUCH WINE, WAS INDISCREET. HOW INDISCREET? HE SAID THAT WHETHER THE KING AND CARDINAL OF YORK WISH IT OR NOT, ALL ENGLAND WILL SOON BE LUTHERAN. ENGLAND? NEVER! HE SAID THAT SOON EVERY ENGLISHMAN WILL HAVE THE SCRIPTURES IN THEIR NATIVE TONGUE. AND THEY WILL HAVE THEM FROM COLOGNE. THAT THEY WILL NOT! WHERE IS THIS PRINTING WORKS OF PETER QUENTEL? WILL! WILL! WE HAVE MINUTES ONLY TO BE GONE. AWAY FROM HERE! WHY? WHAT HAS HAPPENED? THEY HAVE FOUND US! HURRY! WE MUST GO! WHO HAS FOUND US? HERMAN RINCKE. THEN WHO BETRAYED US? IT MATTERS NOT. BUT THE BOOKS... THE MANUSCRIPTS. WE MUST GO TO THE PRINTERS... I HAVE ALL WE NEED. HURRY! THEY ARE AT THE VERY DOORS! THESE... OUTSIDE UNDER THE SACKS... AND YOU - DO THE SAME WITH THOSE. AND HURRY PLEASE. THERE ISN'T VERY MUCH TIME... THERE IS NO TIME AT ALL, HERR QUENTEL... PLEASE, LEAVE EVERYTHING AS IT IS. SO HERR QUENTEL, WHO COMMISSIONED THIS... THIS PERFIDIOUS WORK? HERR QUENTEL, IS NOT THE LOSS OF YOUR TRADE ENOUGH? WOULD YOU ALSO LOSE YOUR LIBERTY? PERHAPS... PERHAPS YOUR LIFE? HIS NAME IS WILLIAM TYNDALE. WILLIAM TYNDALE... HMMM. SUDDENLY, WOLSEY, SUDDENLY - NOT SUBTLY OR INSIDIOUSLY, BUT SUDDENLY - WE HAVE THE SCRIPTURES... IN ENGLISH...EVERYWHERE! SUDDENLY WOLSEY, WE HAVE A RAGE OF BISHOPS. SUDDENLY WOLSEY, WE HEAR OF THE WORLD'S END - AND I AM NOT TOLD OF IT! WHY? IS IT BECAUSE I AM ONLY THE KING? IS MY MAJESTY SO LIGHT A THING? WHO IS WILLIAM TYNDALE? SOME LOW-BORN PRIEST SIRE. AND IS THIS THE SAME 'LOW-BORN PRIEST' OF WHOM MY AMBASSADOR TO SPAIN WARNED ME TWELVE MONTHS SINCE? YES. AND IS THIS THE SAME 'LOW-BORN PRIEST' WHO, IT IS SAID, HAD UNDERTAKEN TO TRANSLATE THE WHOLE OF SCRIPTURE? THE SAME. AND WHERE IS MY COMMAND THAT HE BE FOUND AND STOPPED? I HAVE MEN EVEN NOW IN FRANCE AND GERMANY AND FLANDERS WHO HAVE NOT PAUSED IN THEIR SEARCH FOR HIM - WITHOUT SUCCESS. HE MOVES FROM PLACE TO PLACE. PRINTING THE SCRIPTURES ON THE BACK OF A TRAVELING MULE, PERHAPS. EH THOMAS? HAH! IT IS NOT A SUBJECT FOR JEST SIRE. YOU WOULD TELL ME IT IS NO JEST? WHAT BLIND, HALF-WITTED MAN HAVE YOU COMMISSION TO MAKE THE SEARCH? JOHN HACKETT. OH, JOHN HACKETT! AND WHERE HAS JOHN HACKETT LOOKED? WHEREVER TYNDALE HAS BEEN SIGHTED OR WORD OF HIM REPORTED. HAMBURG, COLOGNE, WORMS, MARBURG, EVEN WITTENBERG... WITTENBERG? YES. HE IS IN LEAGUE WITH LUTHER? WITHOUT QUESTION. THEN HE IS INDEED A HERETIC. YOU WILL FIND HIM AND YOU WILL BURN HIS BOOKS. YOU WILL ARREST HIM AND BRING HIM TO ME. COME, THOMAS. I WANT TO TALK TO YOU. HAVE YOU COME TO PLAY? NO ANNE, I HAVE COME TO TALK. YOU WOULD DO BETTER TO PLAY. YOUR BROW HAS A SOLEMN LINE TO IT. THE WORLD IS A SOLEMN PLACE. GO ON, GO ON, YOU PLAY. I SHALL WATCH AND BE AMUSED. HER YOUTH AND BEAUTY TOUCH ME. SO MUCH IS EVIDENT. AND HER NATURE TOO. HER SMILE.. HER LAUGHTER... HER INNOCENCE. THEY DO NOTHING TO YOU THOMAS? WERE I TO LET THEM. I AM A MARRIED MAN. AM I NOT? DO YOU SEEK TO REPROVE ME? IT IS NOT MY PLACE TO REPROVE ANY TO SAVE MYSELF - WHICH I DO OFTEN. I ALSO, BUT A SHIRT OF HAIR WOULD MAKE ME ITCH AND IT IS SCARE SEEMLY FOR A KING TO BE A-SCRATCHING. WOULD YOU REPROVE ME FOR MY SHIRT OF HAIR? I MERELY WISH YOU WOULD CEASE FROM SCRATCHING. IT IS NO MORE SEEMLY FOR A PRIVY COUNCILOR THAN IT IS FOR A KING. WHAT OF THIS MAN TYNDALE'S TESTAMENT, IS THE TRANSLATION SOUND? IT HAS ERRORS IN IT. TUNSTALL WOULD SAY THREE THOUSAND. HOW HE CAN TELL I KNOW NOT - HE DOES NOT HAVE SO MANY FINGERS. THE ERRORS ARE NOT SO MANY. BUT THE BOOK IS EVIL? EVIL WILL COMETH IT. WHY? OH, COME, THOMAS, YOU ARE MY FRIEND. I REPAY YOUR HONESTY WITH MINE OWN. IN MY IGNORANCE AND FOLLY I CANNOT SEE HOW A MERE VOLUME CAN CAUSE SO MUCH HURT. MEN WILL THINK, HAVING THE SCRIPTURES, THAT THEY HAVE THE TRUTH - BUT THIS IS AN ILLUSION. WILL YOU SAY THE SCRIPTURES ARE NOT TRUTH? AYE, THEY ARE. BUT THEY'RE LIKE A CHART. AND THOUGH A MAN HAVE A SEAWORTHY VESSEL AND A CHART IN HIS OWN TONGUE, IF HE DOES NOT HAVE A SAILOR'S KNOWLEDGE TO INTERPRET THE CHART HIS VESSEL IS LOST. SCRIPTURE IS A WEIGHTY MATTER. MEN NEED THE WISE COUNSELS OF THE CHURCH TO UNDERSTAND IT. BUT YOU READ IT, THOMAS, IN GREEK AND LATIN, WHICH ARE AS FAMILIAR TO YOU AS ENGLISH. DO YOU UNDERSTAND THEM? IN PART. IN PART! IN PART! BUT YOU ARE SIR THOMAS MORE! IF YOU SHOULD ONLY UNDERSTAND IN PART, WHERE IS THE MAN WHO WOULD UNDERSTAND IN FULL? PERHAPS THERE IS NO MAN, BUT THE FULL BODY OF THE CHURCH... I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH CATHERINE MY WIFE, WHO CAN BEAR ME NO CHILD. I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH ANNE BOLEYN, WHO CAN BEAR ME A SON, AN HEIR TO THE ENGLISH THRONE, BUT I CANNOT TAKE HER FOR WIFE... SUCH MATTERS ARE NOT WITHIN THE COMPASS OF MY SCHOLARSHIP. AND I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH MOSES, WHO WROTE, IN THE SCRIPTURE: THAT IF A MAN SHALL TAKE HIS BROTHER'S WIFE, IT IS AN UNCLEAN THING AND THEY SHALL BE CHILDLESS. WELL, I TOOK MY BROTHER'S WIFE AND I AM WITHOUT A SON. HOW WOULD YOU INTERPRET THE SCRIPTURES? I AM NOT A THEOLOGIAN. YOU ARE A SCHOLAR THOMAS, WHOSE LEARNING IS SECOND TO NONE. HOW SHOULD I... I INTERPRET THE SCRIPTURES? I WOULD COUNSEL YOU TO SEEK THE OPINION OF LEARNED DOCTORS, EVEN OF HIS HOLINESS THE POPE. THE POPE! HOW DO YOU THINK WILLIAM TYNDALE WOULD ANSWER? NOW THAT SIR, YOU MUST ASK HIM. THERE IS MUCH I WOULD ASK HIM. I WANT HIM FOUND. I AM A MERCHANT WILLIAM, MY BUSINESS BRINGS ME HERE. BY WHAT GOOD PROVIDENCE SHOULD COMMERCE BRING YOU TO MARBURG? I LOOKED FOR YOU, AND I FOUND YOU. AND IF I, THEN IT COULD BE THAT JOHN HACKETT AND ALL THE KING'S AGENTS ARE NOT FAR BEHIND. YOU FOUND ME HUMPHREY BECAUSE YOU ARE MY FRIEND, AND KNOWN AS SUCH, AND BECAUSE GOD WILLS IT. WHAT NEWS DO YOU BRING? GOOD AND BAD. THE NEW TESTAMENT IS SPREAD THROUGHOUT ALL ENGLAND, BUT EVERYWHERE IT IS BURNED BY THE EXPRESS COMMAND OF WOLSEY AND THE KING. IN BURNING IT THEY ARE DOING ONLY WHAT I EXPECTED, AND SO SHALL THEY IF THEY BURN ME, TOO. IF THEY FIND YOU WILLIAM, THEY WILL BURN YOU, TOO. FOR MEN LIKE US, ENGLAND IS NOT A HAPPY PLACE TO BE. [CHAINS RATTLING] COME ON...GET... JOHN FRITH, I AM UNHAPPY THAT YOU, OF ALL MEN, SHOULD TREAT ME ILL. LORD CARDINAL, IT IS I WHO AM BROUGHT FROM A DUNGEON. DID I TREAT YOU ILL, OR IS IT THE OTHER WAY ABOUT? I SET YOU IN MY OWN COLLEGE HERE IN OXFORD, TO WORK FOR THE GLORY OF GOD. AND BEFORE GOD AND THIS COMPANY I DECLARE THAT SUCH IS MY ONLY GOAL. IF SUCH IS YOUR GOAL, WHY DO YOU JOURNEY DOWN A PATH THAT LEADS TO PERDITION? LUTHER'S HERESY... TYNDALE'S HERESY. THE NEW TESTAMENT OF OUR LORD CHRIST IS NOT HERESY, MY LORD CARDINAL. IT IS A TRANSLATION! UNLAWFULLY MADE BY A POOR SCHOLAR WHOSE HEART IS FAR FROM THE GRACE OF GOD. IT IS A TRUE TRANSLATION, FAITHFULLY MADE BY ONE OF THE FINEST GREEK SCHOLARS OF OUR AGE, A MAN WHOSE HEART BEARS THE STAMP OF CHRIST HIMSELF. AND THIS YOU KNOW! THIS I KNOW. THEN SEEING YOU KNOW THE MAN SO WELL, PERHAPS YOU WILL PERSUADE HIM TO COME BEFORE US AND ANSWER CERTAIN QUESTIONS. OF HIS WHEREABOUTS I KNOW NOTHING, OTHER THAN THAT HE IS ABROAD. JOHN FRITH, ARE YOU AWARE THAT IN THIS REALM I AM THE POPE'S REPRESENTATIVE? THAT I MAKE ALL DECISIONS CONCERNING RELIGION AS THOUGH I WERE THE POPE? I KNOW THAT GOD HAS GIVEN US THE SCRIPTURES. DECIDE WHAT YOU WILL, MY LORD, BUT I SHALL STICK WITH THEM. TAKE HIM AWAY! I'LL HEAR NO MORE OF THIS. WOULD GOD THAT I HAD MY HANDS ON TYNDALE'S SCRAWNY NECK. IT IS EVERYWHERE. FROM THE HIGHEST TO THE LOWEST. THE MORE WE BURN, THE MORE THEY APPEAR. AND NOW THIS... 'THE OBEDIENCE OF THE CHRISTIAN MAN'. IT IS A PLAGUE AND AN INFECTION. YES. SO, IF FIRE WILL NOT DESTROY THIS HERESY THEN YOUR PEN MUST. YOUR GRACE, THE LAW WILL NOT PERMIT ME TO READ HERESY, MUCH LESS DEBATE IT. LET US NOT PLAY GAMES THOMAS. YOU WILL HAVE A LICENSE TO READ WHATEVER YOU WILL. MOREOVER, I MYSELF WILL PAY YOU - FIVE THOUSAND POUNDS TO MAKE AN ANSWER. FIVE THOUSAND POUNDS! WHY, I COULD LIVE LIKE A PRINCE FOR SEVERAL LIFETIMES. I SHALL SEE TO IT. NO. I SHALL TAKE UP MY PEN AGAINST TYNDALE FOR THE GLORY OF GOD AND HIS CHURCH, AND I'LL NOT TAKE A PENNY FOR IT. IF YOU BELIEVE THE PROMISES, THEN GOD'S TRUTH JUSTIFIES YOU, THAT IS, FORGIVES YOUR SINS AND SEALS YOU WITH HIS HOLY SPIRIT. IF YOU HAVE TRUE FAITH, SO WILL YOU SEE THE EXCEEDING AND INFINITE LOVE AND MERCY WHICH GOD HAS... ANNE...COME HERE. I THOUGHT SHE WOULD STAY FOREVER. RICHARD! YOU MUST NOT BE HERE! MY MISTRESS... AND THE KING IS WITH HER! THEY'VE GONE - THEY'VE GONE... BUT THEY MAY RETURN! AND IF THEY SHOULD FIND YOU... JUST ONE KISS, THAT'S ALL I ASK. BUT RICHARD...! JUST ONE KISS. AND I HOLD THIS BOOK TO RANSOM. GIVE IT TO ME! JUST ONE KISS. THE BOOK IS LADY ANNE'S. SHE... AND BE QUICK MY LOVE. GO! HIDE YOURSELF! NOW! COME, YOU MUST HELP MY DRESS. THE KING IS GOING TO TAKE ME RIDING. JOHN! MAY GOD BE PRAISED! COME IN! COME IN! HOW DID YOU ESCAPE? NOT ESCAPE, BROTHER. WE WERE SET AT LIBERTY, I, BETTS, SUMNER, RADLEY... OTHERS... SET FREE? HAS THE GOOD LORD TOUCHED THE CARDINAL'S HEART? WOLSEY? HE COULD NO MORE BEAR THE STENCH OF DEATH - AND HIS CAUSE IS DELICATE ENOUGH, THESE DAYS... SO I HAVE HEARD. AND TOO MANY SCHOLARS HAVE ALREADY DIED AT HIS HAND. BUT ENOUGH. I AM FREE. GOD HAS DEALT KINDLY WITH ME. TELL ME NEWS OF WILLIAM. YOU SAW HIM? AYE. HE IS WELL IN MIND AND BODY AND FILLED WITH THE SPIRIT. THOUGH ALL THE CONTINENT IT SEEMS, WOULD DO HIM HARM. AND THE WORK? GOES WELL. SOON WE SHALL HAVE THE BOOKS OF MOSES, IF GOD WILLS IT. I MUST GO TO HIM. NOW? YES, AS SOON AS I AM ABLE. IF YOU FOUND HIM THEN SO SHALL I. BUT WHY? THERE IS WORK YET TO BE DONE HERE. NONE THAT IS SO IMPORTANT. AND WHAT CAN I DO HERE? I DARE NOT UTTER A SINGLE WORD. WE MUST BE CAREFUL, AYE, BUT... CAREFUL! MEN, WOMEN, AND CHILDREN, ALL FROM THE HIGHEST TO THE LOWEST, ARE ARRESTED AND BURNED FOR READING AND BELIEVING THE TRUTH - MUCH LESS FOR UTTERING IT. WE MUST EXAMINE THE TEACHINGS OF THE CHURCH BY SCRIPTURE, BUT UNDERSTAND THE SCRIPTURE BY MEANS OF WHAT THE CHURCH SAYS. YOU ASK IF THE AIR GIVES LIGHT TO THE SUN, OR THE SUN TO THE AIR? IS THE GOSPEL BEFORE THE CHURCH, OR THE CHURCH BEFORE THE GOSPEL? IS THE CHURCH BEFORE THE GOSPEL OR THE GOSPEL BEFORE THE CHURCH? (THINKING) I TELL YOU, THE ROMISH CHURCH FROM WHICH THE LUTHERANS CAME OUT WAS BEFORE THEM, AND THEREFORE IS THE RIGHT ONE. WHO ARE YOU? WHAT DO YOU WANT? WHAT LETTERS AND BOOKS HAVE YOU LATELY RECEIVED FROM ABROAD? LATELY? NONE. VERY WELL, WHAT AID HAVE YOU GIVEN TO ANY PERSONS LIVING ON THE CONTINENT? NONE, FOR MORE THAN THREE YEARS. WILLIAM TYNDALE ABODED WITH ME SIX MONTHS - AND HIS LIFE WAS WHAT A GOOD PRIEST'S SHOULD BE. I GAVE HIM TEN POUNDS WHEN HE LEFT, BUT NOTHING SINCE. WHERE IS TYNDALE NOW? I DO NOT KNOW. IN THE COURSE OF TRADE, I MET HIM ONCE IN MARBURG, SOME MONTHS SINCE, BUT HE DEPARTED THENCE SOON AFTERWARD. SO YOU HAVE NEWS OF HIM? ONLY THAT HE WAS SHIPWRECKED AND ALL HIS WORKS WERE LOST. WHERE HE IS NOW I CANNOT TELL. AND MILES COVERDALE? IS IT NOT TRUE THAT EVEN NOW COVERDALE IS SOMEWHERE COLLABORATING WITH TYNDALE IN TRANSLATION THE BOOKS OF MOSES? I KNOW NOTHING OF COVERDALE. IF WHAT YOU SAY IS TRUE THEN YOU ARE BETTER INFORMED THAN I. AND WHAT OF THESE? THEY HAVE BEEN OPENLY ON MY TABLE FOR MORE THAN TWO YEARS. I HAVE NEVER HEARD THAT ANY PRIESTS, OR FRIARS OR LAYMEN LEARNT ANY GREAT ERROR FROM THEM. YOU CANNOT PUT A DRY STICK IN THE FIRE WITHOUT ITS BURNING, NOR CAN YOU NOURISH A SNAKE IN OUR VEST WITHOUT ITS BITING YOU. YOU STAND ACCUSED OF HAVING MAINTAINED THOSE WHO ARE TRANSLATING THE SCRIPTURES INTO ENGLISH, OF HAVING BOUGHT MARTIN LUTHER'S TRACTS, OF HAVING IMPORTED THEM INTO THE KINGDOM AND, LASTLY, OF HAVING SAID THAT FAITH ALONE IS SUFFICIENT TO SAVE A MAN. WHAT IS YOUR DEFENSE AND PLEA? NONE OF THIS WILL I DENY. I HAVE NO DEFENSE, BUT I WILL PLEAD. I AM A MERCHANT. WHAT WILL BECOME OF MY WORKMEN IF I AM CAST INTO PRISON OR BURNT. THEY MUST HAVE MONEY EVERY WEEK- AND WHOSE TO PAY THEM? ALSO, CONSIDER THAT MY TRADE BRINGS IN LARGE SUMS TO HIS MAJESTY'S CUSTOMS. IF I AM NOT HERE, THAT COMMERCE WILL STOP. SET HIM FREE. TRADE CAREFULLY MERCHANT. THE APOSTLES TAUGHT BY MOUTH MANY OF THE THINGS THEY DID NOT WRITE, IN ORDER THAT THEY SHOULD NOT COME INTO THE HANDS OF THE MOCKING HEATHEN... YOU ASK WHENCE COMES PENANCE. PRAYING TO SAINTS AND PURGATORY... (THINKING) I MARVEL THAT YOU SHOULD EXCEPT IT BE A PLAIN POINT THAT YOU GO STRAIGHT TO HELL. AND YOU SAY YOU LOVE THIS BOY? I DO INDEED MY LORD. THEN LET IT BE SAID, HER LOVE FOR YOU, TOGETHER WITH MY LOVE FOR THE LADY ANNE HAVE CONSPIRED TO SAVE YOU. FOR IF PETITION FROM EACH HAD NOT COME BEFORE ME, YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN NOTHING BUT KINDLING FOR WOLSEY'S FIRES. I AM MOST HUMBLY AND DEEPLY GRATEFUL, MY LORD. AND SO YOU SHOULD BE. NOW GO. YES, SIRE. AND READ NO MORE HERESIES! MY LORD. SO, THEN, WHAT THE VOLUME THAT SO NEARLY COST A BOY HIS LIFE? THIS, MY LORD. READ SOME TO ME. KINGS MUST MAKE ACCOUNT OF THEIR DOINGS ONLY TO GOD. NO PERSON CAN BE EXEMPT FROM THIS ORDINANCE OF GOD; NEITHER CAN THE PROFESSION OF MONKS AND FRIARS OR ANYTHING THAT THE POPES AND BISHOPS CAN LAY FOR THEMSELVES, EXCEPT THEM FROM THE SWORD OF THE KING IF THEY BREAK THE LAWS. FOR IT IS WRITTEN, LET EVERY SOUL SUBMIT HIMSELF UNTO THE AUTHORITY OF THE HIGHER POWERS. EXCELLENT! THIS IS TRULY A BOOK FOR KINGS TO READ - AND FOR ME PARTICULARLY. NOW WHO WROTE THIS? WILLIAM TYNDALE. THEN I SHALL READ IT AND WE WILL TALK SOME MORE. AH, TYNDALE...WOULD THAT HE WERE BY MY SIDE IN THESE TIMES. HE MUST BE FOUND. THANK YOU. YOU ARE STEPHEN VAOUGHAN? YES. AND YOU CARRY LETTERS FROM THE KINGS OF ENGLAND. WHO ARE YOU? I HAVE BEEN SENT BY SOMEONE WHO CALLS HIMSELF A FRIEND OF YOURS. SOMEONE WHO DESIRES VERY MUCH TO SPEAK WITH YOU. WHO IS THIS FRIEND? WHERE IS HE? I DO NOT KNOW HIM, BUT IF YOU COME WITH ME YOU WILL SEE FOR YOURSELF. WHY SHOULD I TRUST YOU? WHY SHOULD YOU NOT? WHY SHOULD I DECEIVE YOU? THAT IS A QUESTION I SHOULD ASK. YOUR FRIEND SAYS THAT YOU HAVE BEEN HERE IN ANTWERP FOUR LONG MONTHS AND ACCOMPLISHED NOTHING. HOW DOES HE KNOW THIS? HE HAS MANY FRIENDS HERE IN THE CITY. HE ASKED ME TO TELL YOU THAT YOU COULD STAY FOR ANOTHER FOUR AND TWENTY, EXCEPT THAT YOU FOLLOW ME. I HAVE NOT PAID FOR MY ALE. IT WILL BE DONE. DO YOU NOT KNOW WHO I AM? I AM WILLIAM TYNDALE. THE KING WOULD HAVE YOU RETURN TO ENGLAND. THE KING DOES NOT KNOW WHAT HE ASKS. I CAN OFFER ONLY THE WORD OF GOD - SMALL COMFORT TO A MAN WHO WOULD PUT AWAY HIS WIFE, BE HE KING OR COMMONER. BUT HIS QUARREL WITH ROME... IS NOT MY QUARREL. BUT IF YOU HAVE A COMMON ENEMY, WHAT DOES IT MATTER IF YOU HAVE NOT A COMMON CAUSE? SO LONG AS THAT ENEMY IS VANQUISHED? THE KING'S MIND IS FOR ROME. HIS HEART IS FOR ANNE BOLEYN. HIS QUARREL IS WITH HIMSELF. FOR ME, HEART AND MIND, I MUST CARE ONLY FOR THE WORD OF GOD. THEN USE THE OCCASION FOR THE WORD OF GOD! COME TO ENGLAND. I HAVE WARNED HIS MAJESTY OF THE SUBTLE WAYS OF THE CLERGY. I AM A LOYAL SUBJECT OF THE KING AND I WANT HIM TO KNOW THIS. THEN COME TO ENGLAND. HERE, I SUFFER HUNGER, THIRST, COLD, THE BITTER ABSENCE FROM MY FRIENDS - HARDSHIP AND CONTINUAL DANGER. BUT BELIEVE ME, THESE MATTER NOTHING TO ME IF I DO HONOUR TO GOD, TRUE SERVICE TO THE KING AND AM OF GOOD WORTH TO HIS PEOPLE. GOD KNOWS I AM NOT AFRAID TO DIE AND BE WITH CHRIST, BUT HOW SHALL MY WORK PROSPER IF I AM TIED TO A STAKE AND BURNED. YOU WILL BE SAFE. SAY AS MUCH TO WOLSEY. WOLSEY IS DEAD AND CROMWELL FAVORS YOU. AND THOMAS MORE IS CHANCELLOR AND WOULD GLADLY LOSE AN ARM TO GAIN MY NECK. ASK WHAT GUARANTEES YOU WILL, AND THE KING WILL GRANT THEM. SUCH PROMISES NEED NOT BIND HIM. THE CLERGY WILL PERSUADE HIM THAT I AM A HERETIC. SO YOU WILL NOT RETURN? I WOULD... BUT I CANNOT. IF I AM UNABLE TO PERSUADE YOU, WHY, THEN DID YOU AGREE TO MEET ME? TO PROTEST MY LOYALTY TO THE KING... AND TO ASK YOU TO GIVE HIM THESE, THAT HE MIGHT READ THEM. THE NIGHT IS DRAWING IN AND SOON THE CITY GATES WILL CLOSE. WE MUST GO OUR SEPARATE WAYS. SHALL WE MEET AGAIN? GOD BE WITH YOU. (THINKING) MY LORD SECRETARY CROMWELL... '...DECLARE UNTO YOUR MAJESTY WHAT, IN MY POOR JUDGMENT, I THINK OF THE MAN, I DO ASSURE YOUR GRACE THAT I HAVE NEVER SPOKEN WITH A MAN WHO IS MORE...' I DON'T WANT TO KNOW WHAT HE THINKS OF HIM, CROMWELL. VAUGHAN THINKS TOO WELL OF HIM BY HALF. I HAVE READ THIS, ALL. TYNDALE'S DISPUTATION AGAINST MY LORD CHANCELLOR, AND I TELL YOU THIS: IT IS FULL OF LIES, SEDITION AND CALUMNY. THEN YOUR MAJESTY HAS CHANGED HIS OPINION? MY MAJESTY HAS INDEED! LISTEN TO THIS...THIS... REPORT FROM YOUR 'AGENT' - THIS IS WHAT TYNDALE WOULD SAY TO ME. TO ME! THE KING! WHAT IMPUDENCE THE MAN HAS. "IF YOU WOULD CONDESCEND... CONDESCEND, TO PERMIT ONLY A BARE TEXT OF THE SCRIPTURES TO CIRCULATE AMONG THE PEOPLE, I WOULD BIND MYSELF NEVER TO WRITE AGAIN. I WOULD THROW MYSELF AT YOUR FEET, OFFERING MY BODY AS A SACRIFICE, READY TO SUBMIT IF NECESSARY TO TORTURE AND DEATH." AND AT LEAST HE KNOWS WHAT HE MAY EXPECT. BUT MUCH OF WHAT TYNDALE WRITES AND SPEAKS COULD WORK TO YOUR OWN ADVANTAGE. I WOULD BEG TO REMIND YOUR MAJESTY THAT YOU ADMIRED HIS SCHOLARSHIP AND WANTED HIM TO RETURN. AND NOT I WANT HIM TO STAY AWAY. HE IS A PERVERSE AND HARDENED CHARACTER WHO CANNOT BE CHANGED. I AM ONLY TOO HAPPY THAT HE IS OUT OF ENGLAND. I SHALL FIND ANOTHER SCHOLAR - ANOTHER HUNDRED, AND BETTER ONES AT THAT. IT IS A PITY, YOUR HIGHNESS, THAT JOHN FRITH SHOULD BE AMONG THE SECTARIANS. AH! JOHN FRITH. WHO ON EARTH IS JOHN FRITH? HE IS A MAN GREATLY DISTINGUISHED IN SCIENCES AND LETTERS. HE TOO, HOLDS CERTAIN OPINIONS WHICH MAY GIVE COMFORT TO YOUR MAJESTY. I WOULD BEG TO TELL YOU, LORD SECRETARY, THAT TYNDALE IS NO COWARD, BUT... YES, YES, I DO NOT DOUBT IT... BUT WHEN HIS OWN BROTHER IS PARADED ABOUT FACE ON A HORSE AND BRANDED A HERETIC BY NONE LESS THAN THE LORD CHANCELLOR... YES, YES, IT WAS IMPOLITIC, BUT... HOW THEN CAN I PERSUADE THE MAN THAT HIS SAFE CONDUCT IS ASSURED? A PROBLEM. OR THAT A RETURN TO ENGLAND WOULD BE TO HIS ADVANTAGE? VAUGHAN, LISTEN TO ME. THE KING HAS WEARIED OF TYNDALE. HE HAS? HE STRONGLY DESIRES THE RECONCILIATION OF JOHN FRITH. FRITH? WHO, HE BELIEVES, IS NOT SO FAR ADVANCED AS TYNDALE IN HIS EVIL WAY... EVIL? AND THE KING, ALWAYS FULL OF MERCY, IS READY TO RECEIVE HIM TO FAVOR. SO TRY TO ATTRACT HIM. CHARITABLY...POLITICALLY. INDEED... THIS IS A CAUSE FOR SADNESS, THOMAS. WHAT DOES YOUR RESIGNATION SAY TO ME? THAT HIGH OFFICE DEMANDS OF A MAN HIGH COUNSEL - WHICH I CANNOT GIVE. NOTHING MORE. I THINK THERE IS MORE. I THINK YOU WOULD TELL ME YOU ARE A MAN OF CONSCIENCE, AND YOU CANNOT SERVE TWO MASTERS. MY LORD, I REJOICE IN SERVING TWO MASTERS. I SERVE YOU AS MY KING AND I SERVE HIM WHO IS MASTER OF US BOTH. THOMAS...THOMAS, YOU CAN NOT AGREE MY DIVORCE FROM CATHERINE AND THIS IS HOW YOU HAVE CHOSEN TO TELL ME. AND HOW WILL YOU SPEND YOUR TIME - IN DISPUTATION AND WRITING? AND POVERTY. THEN GO. THOMAS... YOU'RE A REPROACH TO ME! AND WOULD YOU GO TO ENGLAND? YES. JOHN...THERE IS NO MAN ON EARTH I LOVE SO MUCH AS YOU. NO ONE IN THE LORD WHO CAN ACCOMPLISH SO MUCH OF WHAT I HOPE AND PRAY FOR. AND SHALL I ACCOMPLISH IT HERE, IN A FOREIGN LAND? JUST BE HAPPY TO ACCOMPLISH IT AT ALL, WHEREVER IT MAY BE. NOTHING AWAITS YOU IN ENGLAND... THAN YOU HAVE SUFFERED HERE. WHAT AWAITS ME IN ENGLAND IS NO WORSE AND NO LESS THAN YOU HAVE SUFFERED HERE. YOU HAVE BEEN HUNGRY, COLD, PERSECUTED - SHIPWRECKED EVEN... AND WITH ALL SPENT MANY YEARS AWAY FROM THOSE YOU LOVE. WHAT CAN ENGLAND DO TO ME THAT THE WORLD HASN'T DONE TO YOU? JOHN, YOU HAVE A WIFE HERE. YOU HAVE WORK HERE. YOU ASK ME WHAT ENGLAND CAN DO? ASK THOSE WHO CAN ANSWER NO MORE. ASK BILNEY, ASK TEWKESBURY, ASK BAYFIELD... YES, AND AS ONCE YOU SAID TO ME, THEY WILL OBTAIN A BETTER RESURRECTION. IF GOD GIVES ME STRENGTH I SHAN'T FLINCH FROM THE SCAFFOLD. WILLIAM I GO TO ENGLAND, NOT BECAUSE HENRY REQUIRES IT, BUT TO SPREAD THE GOSPEL OF CHRIST. AND HOW WILL YOU SPREAD THE GOSPEL FROM A SCAFFOLD? HOW MANY MEN WILL HEAR YOU? WHAT GOOD WILL COME OF THIS? I MUST GO UP TO JERUSALEM. AS GOD WILLS IT. (THINKING) DEARLY BELOVED BROTHER, BE COLD, SOBER, WISE, AND CIRCUMSPECT. KEEP YOU LOW BY THE GROUND, AVOIDING HIGH QUESTIONS. EXPOUND THE LAW TRULY, AND OPEN THE VEIL OF MOSES TO CONDEMN ALL FLESH AND PROVE ALL MEN SINNERS. THEN SET ABROACH THE MERCY OF OUR LORD JESUS, AND LET THE WOUNDED CONSCIENCES DRINK OF HIM. BELOVED IN MY HEART, THERE LIVETH NOT ONE IN WHOM I HAVE SO GREAT HOPE AND TRUST AND IN WHOM MY HEART REJOICETH. NOT SO MUCH FOR YOUR LEARNING AND WHATEVER GIFTS YOU HAVE, AS BECAUSE YOU WALK IN THOSE THINGS THAT THE CONSCIENCE MAY FEEL, AND NOT IN THE IMAGINATION OF THE BRAIN. DO YOU NOT HOLD THAT THE NATURAL BODY OF CHRIST, HIS FLESH, HIS BLOOD, HIS BONES, ARE CONTAINED UNDER THE SACRAMENT AND ARE THERE PRESENT WITHOUT ANY FIGURE OF SPEECH? NO...I DO NOT. (TYNDALE'S WRITING CONTINUES) CLEAVE FAST TO THE ROCK OF THE HELP OF GOD, STAND FAST AND COMMIT YOURSELF TO GOD. HE IS OUR GOD AND HIS IS THE GLORY... AS THE SHEEP BOUND BY THE HAND OF THE BUTCHER WITH TIMID LOOK BEGS THAT HIS BLOOD MAY SOON BE SHED, EVEN SO DO I PRAY MY JUDGES THAT MY BLOOD BE SHED NOW, IF BY MY DEATH THE KING'S EYES SHOULD BE OPENED. (THINKING) DEARLY BELOVED, FEAR NOT MEN THAT THREATEN, NOR TRUST MEN THAT SPEAK FAIR. YOUR CAUSE IS THE GOSPEL OF CHRIST, A LIGHT THAT MUST BE FED WITH THE BLOOD OF FAITH. YOU ARE NOT ALONE. FOLLOW THE EXAMPLE OF ALL YOUR OTHER DEAR BRETHREN WHO CHOOSE TO SUFFER IN HOPE OF A BETTER RESURRECTION. BEAR THE IMAGE OF CHRIST IN YOUR MORTAL BODY AND KEEP YOUR CONSCIENCE PURE AND UNDEFILED. YOUR WIFE IS WELL CONTENT WITH THE WILL OF GOD AND WOULD NOT FOR HER SAKE HAVE THE GLORY OF GOD HINDERED. AS OUR LORD JESUS WEPT OVER JERUSALEM, WILL HE NOW WEEP OVER ENGLAND - WILL HE WEEP FOR THOSE WHO KILL THE PROPHETS AND BURN THEM WHICH ARE SENT TO HER? WILL HE GATHER THE CHILDREN OF ENGLAND EVEN AS A HEN GATHERS HER CHICKENS UNDER HER WING? I'M NOT A SCHOLAR, WILLIAM, BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IN A GOOD FAMILY, THE CHILDREN TRUST THEIR FATHER - EVEN WHEN THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND THE WISDOM ONLY YEARS CAN BRING. AYE. AND SOMETIMES, MRS. POYNTZ, A GOOD MOTHER CAN SAY THE RIGHT WORD TO A FAITHLESS CHILD. WHO KNOWS, EVEN NOW, WHAT THE GOOD LORD PREPARES FOR HIS PEOPLE. YOU KNOW WHO I AM? YES YOUR GRACE. YOU ARE STOKESLEY, BISHOP OF LONDON. AND WHAT DO YOU KNOW OF ME? THAT YOU ARE WISE AND CHARITABLE AND... DO NOT LIE TO ME! YOU KNOW NO SUCH THING. TUNSTALL WAS WISE AND CHARITABLE, KIND AND GOOD. I AM WISE. CHARITY IS SOMETHING I USE SPARINGLY, AND NOT ON ROGUES LIKE YOU. NO, YOUR GRACE. NOW, I SHALL RECOUNT SUCH THAT I KNOW OF YOU. YOU ARE HARRY PHILLIPS, THIEF, LIAR, A VILLAIN AND A REPROACH TO YOUR FATHER. NOW, TELL ME, WHAT COMMON GROUND IS THERE BETWEEN US? THERE CAN BE NONE, YOUR GRACE, BETWEEN A ROGUE SUCH AS I AND YOUR GOOD SELF. OH, YOU FAWNING PITIFUL CREATURE. I SHALL TELL YOU. WHAT THINK YOU OF THESE... 'THE OBEDIENCE OF THE CHRISTIAN MAN', 'PRACTICE OF PRELATES', 'PARABLE OF THE WICKED MAMMON', 'THE NEW TESTAMENT'... IN ENGLISH? THEY ARE TO BE DESPISED, YOUR GRACE. AND THEIR AUTHOR? HE SHOULD BE PUT TO THE FLAMES AND BURNED. THERE! WE HAVE COMMON GROUND BETWEEN US. TELL ME WHY DO YOU THINK, DOES WILLIAM TYNDALE YET LIVE AND WORK AND INFECT THIS HAPPY ISLAND WITH HIS POISON? BECAUSE HE IS CRAFTY AND CONCEALS HIMSELF WELL. SO THEN, HIS CAPTURE REQUIRES A MAN OF EQUAL CRAFTINESS. YES, YOUR GRACE. SUCH A MAN ARE YOU. YOU WILL FIND HIM, ARREST HIM, AND BRING HIM TO ME. BUT YOUR GRACE... OR I SHALL FIND FOR YOU THE DARKEST, COLDEST, WETTEST CELL IN ALL LONDON, AND THAT IS WHERE YOU WILL END YOUR DAYS. YES, YOUR GRACE. THOMAS MORE... HOW ARE THE MIGHTY FALLEN. I AM AS NEAR TO HEAVEN HERE IN THE TOWER AS I WOULD BE IN MY OWN HOME. THOMAS, I AM YOUR FRIEND! AND THE KING IS A GOOD AND GRACIOUS LORD TOWARDS YOU. THAT HAS NEVER BEEN IN DISPUTE. THEN SAY AS MUCH. I HAVE, AND DO. THOMAS, AN ACT OF PARLIAMENT HAS PROCLAIMED THE KING'S SUPREMACY. HE IS THE HEAD OF THE CHURCH. I HAVE NOT UTTERED A SINGLE WORD AGAINST IT. AND NOT A SINGLE WORD FOR IT. YOUR SILENCE CONDEMNS YOU. THAT'S WHAT THEY'LL SAY. IT'S TREASON, THOMAS. IF I MUST DIE, THE EXECUTIONER WILL DO NO MORE THAN OPEN THE GATES OF HEAVEN FOR ME. I SHALL DIE FOR MY FAITH IN THE CATHOLIC CHURCH AND AS A GOOD SERVANT OF GOD AND THE KING, BUT TO GOD FIRST OF ALL. IN YOUTH, ALL THE DAYS ARE SUMMER. WE RODE TOGETHER AS BOYS, DON'T YOU KNOW. BUT NOW THE SUMMER IS OVER AND I CAN ONLY LOOK BACK FONDLY. YOU ARE A RARE AND TRUE FRIEND, JOHN. SO ALSO WAS THOMAS MORE. JOHN! NO, NO, LET HIM BE, PROVE MY POINT. WHO BUT A TRUE FRIEND WOULD BE SO BOLD? NONE, BUT A FRIEND OF ONE'S YOUTH. THOMAS WAS A FRIEND INDEED. HE LOST HIS HEAD FOR REASON'S OF STATE - BUT I LOVED HIM DEARLY. TELL ME, DID NOT WILLIAM TYNDALE LODGE HERE IN YEARS PAST? YES, A LONG TIME AGO. HE WAS TUTOR TO OUR CHILDREN. HOW WAS HE THEN? HOW WAS HE? WELL, I HAVE READ ALL THAT HE HAS WRITTEN. IT SEEMS TO ME SUCH WONDROUS WORDS SPEAK WELL OF THE MAN WHO WROTE THEM. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT YOU ARE AT VARIANCE WITH YOUR MASTER. SHE IS MY WIFE, DAMMIT. WHAT OTHER THAN THAT SHE WOULD BE AT VARIANCE WITH ME? WILLIAM TYNDALE WAS, AND STILL IS, A MAN OF COURAGE, WISDOM AND INFINITE KINDNESS. SO I DEEMED HIM TO BE. IS STILL, YOU SAY? YOU KNOW HIM STILL? BY REPORT. HE LODGES WITH A COUSIN, THOMAS POYNTZ. YOU KNOW THE PLACE? HE LIVES ABROAD - WE DON'T KNOW WHERE. MY COUSIN IS A MERCHANT, A TRAVELER. HE MAY HAVE SHARED A LODGING AT SOME TIME OF BUSINESS, BUT NOTHING MORE. YOU KNOW, I OFTEN THINK THE CROWN IS HEAVY, WHEN MY FRIENDS DO NOT TRUST ME. MASTER TYNDALE? ONE MOMENT SIR. PLEASE TAKE HIM. GOD BE WITH YOU. SIR? I AM HARRY PHILLIPS, SIR. COME TO ACQUAINT MYSELF TO YOU. PHILLIPS...PHILLIPS... I HEARD YOU PREACH THIS MORNING, SIR - A WORD, IF I MAY SAY, FULL OF TRUTH AND POWER AND MUCH TO THE GLORY OF CHRIST. THE WORD WAS HIS OWN. I WAS READING FROM PAUL'S LETTER TO THE CHURCH AT CORINTH. BUT IN ENGLISH! I AM A STUDENT AT LOUVAIN. THERE THE WORD IS HELD IN CONTEMPT. I TRAVEL HERE AS OFTEN AS I CAN TO LISTEN AND LEARN... YES, NOW I RECALL - PHILLIPS! THE MERCHANTS HAVE SPOKEN OF YOU, HIGHLY, AND OF YOUR INTEREST IN THE WORD. BELIEVE ME, MY BROTHER, I CANNOT BEGIN TO TELL OF THE JOY BROUGHT BY THE FREEDOM HERE. EVERYONE SPEAKS OF CHRIST WITHOUT FEAR. THE CITY PROFITS BY THE ENGLISH TRADE, SO THEREFORE WE ARE SAFE ENOUGH, AND LEFT IN PEACE WHEN CLOSE TO THE MERCHANTS HOUSES. AND WHAT OF LODGINGS? ARE THERE ANY NEAR THE MERCHANT'S HOUSE? WILLIAM! THOMAS! HARRY, THIS IS MY GOOD AND CLOSE FRIEND THOMAS POYNTZ... AND MRS. POYNTZ. WELCOME TO OUR HOME. WE HAVE HEARD MUCH OF YOU. AND I OF YOU. YOU ARE NO LESS HANDSOME A WOMAN THAN WAS ASSURED ME BY WILLIAM. WILLIAM! (WILLIAM) HER PRICE IS ABOVE RUBIES. (THOMAS) HAVE YOU BEEN IN ANTWERP LONG? JUST A SHORT TIME. I FIND THE CITY FULL OF ENGLISH MERCHANTS, ALL FOLLOWERS OF THE GOSPEL AND STRONG IN THE WORD OF GOD. AND SUCH A ONE IS HARRY - HIS OUTSPOKEN FAVOR OF THE GOSPEL GOES BEFORE HIM, THOUGH I FEAR HE IS RATHER MORE COURAGEOUS THAN CAUTIOUS. THE TRUTH DESERVES BOLDNESS - THOUGH IT SHAMES ME TO SAY SO TO SOMEONE LIKE YOU. WILLIAM, THESE HAVE ARRIVED. AH! THESE VOLUMES...! YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH THEM? AS WITH MY OWN FACE. BUT I NEVER THOUGHT PROVIDENCE WOULD FAVOR ME WITH KNOWING THEIR AUTHOR. IF I MAY MAKE SO BOLD, I HAVE PREPARED A MEAL - IF PERHAPS YOU WOULD LIKE TO COME THROUGH. MADAM, IT IS WRITTEN THAT ANGELS HAVE APPEARED IN THE GUISE OF MEN. I PERCEIVE THAT NOT MEN ONLY, BUT ALSO WOMEN. WILLIAM, HOW WELL DO YOU KNOW THIS MAN? WHY DO YOU ASK? I CANNOT SAY... CAN WE TRUST HIM? THOMAS, OF COURSE! HOW CAN YOU THINK ILL OF HIM? HE SEEMS TO BE A MAN OF QUIET MANNERS AND GODLY BEHAVIOR. LET US GO AND DINE. THOMAS, SPEAK TO HIM, TOMORROW. LET HIM EARN YOUR CONFIDENCE. [THUNDER] YOU DO WELL TO SPEAK OF THE DANGERS OF ANTWERP. A MAN COULD BE DROWNED AND CARRIED AWAY IN SUCH A FLOOD. AH! THE RAIN WILL STOP, BELIEVE ME. TOMORROW, IT WILL BE FINE. BUT THE ENEMIES OF THE GOSPEL WILL STILL BE WITH US. IF YOU ARE TO RETURN TO THE CITY, YOU'LL BE ADVISED TO TAKE A GUIDE. RETURN I MUST. I HAVE SEVERAL PURCHASES TO MAKE. BUT TELL ME, YOU SPEAK OF DANGER. DOES MASTER TYNDALE NOT FEAR THAT SOMEONE MAY BE BRIBED? A FRIEND PERHAPS? MASTER TYNDALE THINKS WELL OF ALL MEN. SUCH THOUGHTS WOULD FIND NO PLACE IN HIM. I HAVE MUCH GOLD. FOR WHAT? FOR MY PURCHASES. GOOD. OUR FRIEND IS MUCH TAKEN WITH THE CITY. IT IS OLD, AND THERE IS SUFFERING - AND ONE IS ALWAYS AFRAID THAT SOME NEW PLAGUE WILL APPEAR - BUT GOD IS HERE AND WORKING OUT HIS WILL. AND YOU ALSO. I SHOULD LIKE TO COME WITH YOU - TO WITNESS YOUR PREACHING AND MINISTRATIONS. THEN COME, THERE IS ALWAYS WORK. AND YOU THOMAS, WILL YOU ALSO JOIN US? TOMORROW I MUST SAIL FOR LONDON. MY BUSINESS WILL TAKE ME SOME TIME. THEN IT IS BUT YOU AND I, WILLIAM. WE SHALL BE ABOUT GOD'S WORK IN THE MORNING - AND THEN WE SHALL DINE - AND AT MY EXPENSE. WELL, IF THAT IS YOUR WISH. IT IS, INDEED IT IS. ONE MOMENT... HERE, MY FRIEND... THERE, IT IS LITTLE ENOUGH... WE OUGHT TO BE FOR OUR NEIGHBOR WHAT CHRIST WAS TO US. WILLIAM! HARRY - NOW WE THOUGHT WE'D LOST YOU. FORGIVE ME. I PAUSED ONLY TO PURCHASE THIS VOLUME - A GIFT FOR MY TUTOR. YOU SEEM TO KNOW THIS TOWN BETTER THAN I DO HARRY. A MORNING'S WORK DONE WELL, AND TO THE GLORY OF GOD. AND BY THE GRACE OF GOD. IT IS HE WHO DOES THE WORK IF WE WOULD BUT LET HIM. AND SO WE HAVE EARNED OUR BREAD. WILLIAM... I THINK I HAVE BEEN ROBBED! ROBBED, HARRY? WHERE? WELL, I DON'T KNOW. IT DOESN'T MATTER, I CARRIED ONLY A FEW SHILLINGS. EXCEPT, I WAS TO BUY YOU A MEAL. I HAVE MONEY, I WILL BUY THE MEAL. GOD FORBID! IT WAS MY INVITATION! PERHAPS YOU WILL LEND ME THE MONEY I HAVE LOST. I WILL REPAY YOU AS SOON AS WE RETURN. WHEN YOU CAN, HARRY, WHEN YOU CAN. I AM DOUBLY INDEBTED TO YOU WILLIAM. RUN, HARRY, RUN! SAVE YOUR SELF! YES, THIS IS THE MAN. TAKE HIM AWAY. WHAT HAVE THEY DONE? WILLIAM! AND YOU, MY LOVE, ARE YOU HARMED? THEY HAVE TAKEN HIM. HE SEARCHED. HE TOOK HIS BOOKS... I HAVE DONE WHAT I CAN. I HAVE WRITTEN LETTERS. BUT THOMAS, YOU HAVE THE KING'S EAR. HIS EAR! IT IS AS WELL THAT I DO NOT HAVE HIS GOUT OR HIS ULCERATED LEG. HIS EAR AT LEAST IS SOUND. I DO NOT JEST. NOR I. THE AFFAIRS OF CHURCH AND STATE ALIKE DEPEND ON HENRY'S MOOD - AND THAT ITSELF DEPENDS UPON THE PAIN HIS BODY BRINGS. BUT YOU CAN SPEAK WITH HIM. HE ONCE THOUGHT VERY HIGH OF TYNDALE. HE CANNOT SO EASILY ALTER HIS OPINION. HE CANNOT? YOU CAN ASK HIM. YES, I CAN ASK HIM. NO! NO, NO, NO! YOUR LADY ANNE REQUIRED THAT I SHOULD ASK. WHEN MY LADY ANNE SHALL DEIGN TO BEAR A SON, THEN SHALL I HEAR HER REQUESTS. TILL THEN, TYNDALE CAN ROT AND SHE CAN ROT WITH HIM FOR OUGHT I CARE. WILLIAM TYNDALE, THE KING OF ENGLAND HAS SOMEWHAT AGAINST YOU FOR CRIMES COMMITTED IN THAT REALM. THESE DO NOT CONCERN US. YOU HAVE BEEN ARRESTED AND STAND CHARGED WITH HERESY IN THAT: FIRST, YOU MAINTAIN THAT FAITH ALONE JUSTIFIES. SECOND, YOU MAINTAIN THAT TO BELIEVE IN THE FORGIVENESS OF SINS AND TO EMBRACE THE MERCY OFFERED IN THE GOSPEL IS ENOUGH FOR SALVATION. THIRD, YOU AVER THAT THE TRADITIONS OF MAN CANNOT BIND THE SOUL. FOURTH, YOU AFFIRM THAT NEITHER THE VIRGIN, NOR THE SAINTS PRAY FOR US IN THEIR OWN PERSON, AND FIFTH, YOU ASSERT THAT NEITHER THE VIRGIN NOR THE SAINTS SHOULD BE INVOKED BY US. HOW DO YOU ANSWER? I ANSWER THUS, WITH A CLEAR CONSCIENCE BEFORE GOD AND MAN, THAT I HAVE NEVER MAINTAINED, AFFIRMED, AVERRED OR ASSERTED ANYTHING CONTRARY TO THE PLAIN MEANING OF GOD'S HOLY SCRIPTURES. ON THESE ALONE, AND THESE ALONE, I STAND. WOULD YOU SAY, THEN, THAT FAITH ALONE JUSTIFIES, AND NOT WORDS? THE FRUIT THAT GROWS ON A TREE DOES NOT MAKE THE TREE GOOD OR BAD. IT ONLY MAKES KNOWN WHETHER THE TREE IS A GOOD TREE OR A BAD TREE; AND WORKS DO NOT MAKE A MAN GOOD OR BAD, THEY ONLY MAKE IT PLAIN TO OTHER MEN WHETHER HE WHO PERFORMS THOSE WORKS IS GOOD OR BAD. A MAN IS RECONCILED BEFORE GOD BY FAITH ALONE; AND WORKS SERVE ONLY TO MAKE THIS JUSTIFICATION KNOWN BEFORE MEN. SUCH IS THE CONTENTION FOR THE APOSTLE PAUL, AS IT IS WRITTEN: BY GRACE ARE YOU SAVED, THROUGH FAITH, AND THAT NOT OF YOURSELVES, IT IS THE GIFT OF GOD, NOT OF WORKS, LEST ANY MAN SHOULD BOAST. (THINKING) TO THE MARQUIES OF BERGEN. I BELIEVE, RIGHT WORSHIPFUL, THAT YOU ARE NOT UNAWARE OF WHAT MAY HAVE BEEN DETERMINED CONCERNING ME. WEREFORE I BEG YOUR LORDSHIP, AND THAT BY THE LORD JESUS, THAT IF I AM TO REMAIN HERE THROUGH THE WINTER, YOU WILL PERMIT TO BE SENT TO ME FROM MY GOODS, A WARMER CAP, FOR I SUFFER GREATLY FROM COLD IN THE HEAD, AND AM AFFLICTED BUT PERPETUAL CATARRH, WHICH IS MUCH INCREASED IN THIS CELL. A WARMER COAT, ALSO, AND A PIECE OF CLOTH TO PATCH MY LEGGINGS. AND I ASK TO BE ALLOWED TO HAVE A LAMP IN THE EVENING. BUT, MOST OF ALL, I BEG AND BESEECH YOUR CLEMENCY THAT YOU WILL PERMIT ME TO HAVE THE HEBREW BIBLE, HEBREW GRAMMAR AND HEBREW DICTIONARY, THAT I MAY PASS MY TIME IN STUDY. BUT IF ANY OTHER DECISION HAS BEEN TAKEN CONCERNING ME, TO BE CARRIED OUT BEFORE THE WINTER, I WILL BE PATIENT, ABIDING THE WILL OF GOD, TO THE GLORY OF THE GRACE OF MY LORD JESUS CHRIST, WHOSE SPIRIT, I PRAY, MAY EVER DIRECT YOUR HEART. AMEN. LORD, OPEN THE KING OF ENGLAND'S EYES... (NARRATOR) WHEN TYNDALE DIED, THERE WERE ALREADY TWO BIBLES CIRCULATING IN ENGLAND. EACH EFFECTIVELY CONTAINED TYNDALE'S TRANSLATION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT - AND MUCH OF HIS WORK HAD BEEN USED FOR THE OLD TESTAMENT. WHEN ONE OF THEM, COVERDALE'S VERSION, WAS PRESENTED TO HENRY VIII, HE WAS ASSURED BY THE BISHOPS THAT THEY COULD FIND NO ERRORS IN IT. THEN, IF THERE BE NO HERESIES IN IT, IN GOD'S NAME LET IT GO ABROAD AMONG THE PEOPLE. (NARRATOR) THE FOLLOWING YEAR, HIS MAJESTY AUTHORIZED A SMALL PHRASE OF IMMENSE SIGNIFICANCE TO BE ADDED TO THE TITLE PAGE OF THE ENGLISH BIBLE: 'SET FORTH WITH THE KING'S MOST GRACIOUS LICENSE'. ON SEPTEMBER 5TH, 1538, HENRY ORDERED EVERY CHURCH IN ENGLAND TO DISPLAY 'ONE BOOK OF THE WHOLE BIBLE OF THE LARGEST VOLUME IN ENGLISH'. THE WHOLE BIBLE, PRINTED IN ENGLISH WAS AT THE HEART OF THE REFORMATION IN ENGLAND; IT REMAINS AS A MEMORIAL TO WILLIAM TYNDALE AND AN ANSWER TO HIS DYING PRAYER.
