MORNING, MISS ELIZABETH. CAPTAIN PRITCHARD! CAPTAIN! GOOD MORNING, MISS WHITLEY. SOBER UP, YOU DRUNKEN HUNKS, AND GET ABOARD! BEAUTIFUL MORNING, ISN'T IT? I TOLD YOU TO STAY AWAY FROM MY FIANCE. BUT HE'S WASTING HIS LIFE HERE IN WAPPING, AND I NEED A GOOD SHIP'S SURGEON. STOP FILLING HIS HEAD WITH CHILDISH SCHEMES ABOUT SAILING AWAY TO MAKE A FORTUNE. NOW, DON'T FLAP YOUR SAILS. A MAN OF DR. GULLIVER'S KNOWLEDGE COULD BECOME RICH... BRINGING BACK DYES AND RARE CHEMICALS TO BE SOLD IN LONDON. OR BE BOILED IN A POT BY SAVAGES. THERE ARE NO CANNIBALS IN THE EAST INDIES, MA'AM, AND I'LL TAKE GOOD CARE OF HIM. HE'S GOING TO STAY HERE AND TAKE GOOD CARE OF ME! OH, GOOD MORNING, DR. GULLIVER. GOOD MORNING. THERE'S A BIT OF A HAGGLE GOING ON OUTSIDE. WELL, HOW ARE YOUR INSIDES THIS MORNING, MRS. DREWSBURY? OH, WELL, THANKS TO YOU, MY LIVER'S GURGLING WITH HEALTH. THAT'S WHY I'VE COME TO PAY. HERE. NOW THEN. OH, I'M SORRY IT'S NOT CASH MONEY, DOCTOR, BUT... YOU PROMISED TO MEET ME! CLOSE THE DOOR OR MY FEE WILL ESCAPE! WHOO! WELL, LOVELY AFTERNOON TO YOU BOTH. NO, NO, NO! DRIVE HIM TOWARD THE CORNER! MR. GRINCH IS WAITING AT THE COTTAGE. NO WONDER I LOVE YOU. YOU'RE ALWAYS SWEEPING ME OFF MY FEET. A FINE LIFE... CHASING CHICKENS. I'LL CHASE THEM FOR YOU. YOU TAKE CARE OF THE SICK. I'LL TAKE CARE OF THE DOCTOR. MY FEES FOR THE WEEK. I'D DO BETTER TO CLOSE MY PRACTICE AND OPEN A VEGETABLE STALL. NOT TODAY. WE'RE GOING TO SEE OLD GRINCH ABOUT THAT COTTAGE. YOU PROMISED! WELL, FOR A MAN OF NO PROMISE, I MAKE A LOT OF PROMISES. IF WE GET TWO SHILLINGS FOR THIS LOVELY CHICKEN, WE'LL HAVE TEN POUNDS EVEN TO GIVE MR. GRINCH. MR. GRINCH. THERE. I HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN, DOCTOR. I'LL PAY YOU BACK AS SOON AS I COME BACK FROM THE WAR. BUT THE WAR WITH SPAIN IS OVER. I'M OFF TO THE WAR AGAINST FRANCE. COME BACK ALIVE, HENRY, AND YOU DON'T OWE ME A THING. NOW, PLEASE DON'T JUDGE IT FROM THE OUTSIDE. WE CAN GET TRAVERS THE CARPENTER TO FIX THE EAVES AND THE SHUTTERS. HE STILL OWES YOU FOR THAT BUNION TREATMENT. TRAVERS IS IN DEBTORS' PRISON. OH. OH, HOW TERRIBLE. OH, WELL, WE'LL MANAGE SOMEHOW. AS WELL AS TRAVERS ANYWAY. I'D CARRY YOU ACROSS THE THRESHOLD IF IT WERE SAFE. GOOD MORNING, MR. GRINCH. MORNING. IT TOOK YOU LONG ENOUGH TO GET HERE. WHERE'S THE TEN POUNDS? YOU'RE SUCH A SENTIMENTALIST, GRINCH. I HAVE IT RIGHT HERE. YOU'LL FIX THAT DOOR, OF COURSE. IT WAS FINE UNTIL YOU BANGED IT. THE PRICE IS SET JUST AS IT IS: TEN POUNDS DOWN. I'LL HOLD THE MORTGAGE FOR THE REST. YOU'D BE SURPRISED WHAT BRUSHES AND A LITTLE SOAP WILL DO FOR THIS PLACE. HERE. ARE-ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? YES, I-I THINK SO. YOU'RE THREE SHILLINGS SHORT. TO THE DEVIL WITH YOU AND YOUR SHILLINGS! - SHE'S NOT GOING TO LIVE IN THIS DIRTY, MISERABLE HOVEL! - I'LL TAKE THE MONEY YOU HAVE. NOT IF IT WERE FREE! I'M NOT GOING TO LET YOU SPEND YOUR DAYS GRUBBING IN THIS PATCHWORK OF AN EXISTENCE. NOW, COME ON. BE CAREFUL. BUT IT'S ONLY FOR NOW. IF I STAY HERE, I'LL STILL BE IN THE SAME GRINDING RUT TOMORROW, THE NEXT DAY AND ALWAYS. - WITHOUT MONEY, NOTHING CHANGES. - MONEY... IS THAT ALL YOU CAN THINK OF? CAN'T YOU BE CONTENT WITH WHAT WE HAVE? WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING! WHY ARE WE QUARRELING... JEALOUSY THAT YOU LOOKED AT ANOTHER MAN OR I LOOKED AT ANOTHER WOMAN? NO, IT'S MONEY... THE WATCHWORD OF WAPPING. IT ISN'T IMPORTANT TO ME! IT IS TO ME. I AM A DOCTOR, AND I WANT TO HELP THE SICK WITHOUT BEING SICK MYSELF WITH WORRY AND DEBTS. YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE RICH TO BE A GOOD DOCTOR. YOU HAVE TO BE RICH AND IMPORTANT TO BE ANYTHING IN THIS WORLD. YOU JUST WANT TO GO WITH CAPTAIN PRITCHARD. THEN GO. GO! BUT IT'S OVER BETWEEN US. IT'S OVER FOREVER! ELIZABETH! IF THIS STORMING CONTINUES I'LL STARVE TO DEATH. WELL, WE DON'T USUALLY HIT A RIPPER LIKE THIS SO SOON. CHEER UP, DOCTOR. AN EARLY STORM MEANS A SUCCESSFUL JOURNEY. ELIZABETH! LET GO OF ME! WE FOUND HER HIDING IN THE HOLD, SKIPPER. A BIT CHEEKY SHE WAS TOO. THAT'LL BE ALL. ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? FINE, THANK YOU. A BIT HUNGRY. BUT THIS IS INSANE. YOU CAN'T COME ON A JOURNEY LIKE THIS. YOU'LL BE BOILED BY SAVAGES! THEN WE'LL COOK TOGETHER. I'D FOLLOW YOU TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH. THAT'S EXACTLY WHERE WE'RE GOING, BUT YOU'RE NOT. NOW, HOW CAN WE GET HER HOME. WE CAN DROP HER OFF AT THE CANARY ISLANDS. THERE ARE SHIPS GOING BACK TO ENGLAND. I'M NOT GETTING OFF! NOW, ELIZABETH... IT'S WET OUT HERE! YOU'RE STILL GETTING OFF AT THE CANARY ISLANDS! - I AM NOT! - YOU ARE. NOTHING'S GOING TO MAKE ME CHANGE MY PLAN... ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! GWENDOLYN? PLEASE STOP CRYING. I'LL THINK OF SOMETHING. IT'S NO USE. I'M NOT A LILLIPUTIAN ANYMORE. MY FATHER AND I HAVE BEEN BANISHED. WE HAVE TO LEAVE. YOU CAN'T ESCAPE TO BLEFUSCU. YOU'LL BE CAUGHT. THE EMPEROR HAS SPIES EVERYWHERE. WE HAVE TO TRY. BUT YOU SHOULDN'T RISK YOUR LIFE TOO. EXCEPT THAT I LOVE YOU. WE'LL NEVER BE TOGETHER. WE'LL NEVER MARRY. IT'S THIS WAR... THIS STUPID WAR! ISN'T THERE SOMEWHERE WHERE WE CAN GO? JUST HERE... HERE AND NOW. OH, PLEASE STAY, GWENDOLYN. GWENDOLYN! GWENDOLYN! I'VE BEEN WAITING AN HOUR AT THE COVE. THIS IS NO TIME FOR LOVE, AND MY DAUGHTER HAS NO TIME FOR A MAN WHO SERVES THAT TYRANT EMPEROR. MY LOYALTIES ARE NOT TO HIM BUT TO THE LAND OF LILLIPUT! RUN! HELP ME. AH, RELDRESAL, I'VE FINALLY CAUGHT YOU WITH THAT TRAITOR LORD BERMOGG! GUARDS, TAKE THEM!

WE COULDN'T BE SURE. YOU HAPPENED SO SUDDENLY. HE DIDN'T HAPPEN. OUR ENEMY SENT HIM TO KILL US. HE'S THEIR SECRET WEAPON. "WEAPON"? NO, A WAVE WASHED ME OFF A SHIP, AND... OH, ELIZABETH... I MUST FIND HER. NOW, LET ME UP. HE'LL BREAK HIS BONDS! KILL HIM! NO, PLEASE, I WON'T HARM ANYONE. I'M A CIVILIZED MAN... A DOCTOR... FROM ENGLAND. "ENGLAND"? WHAT IS ENGLAND? - THE PLACE I COME FROM. - THERE IS ONLY ONE PLACE... LILLIPUT. AND THE LAND OF BLEFUSCU.

I HAVE SOMEONE I LOVE TOO. I'LL TRY TO HELP YOU. THANK YOU. I'M VERY FOND OF BEEF. LOOK AT THE MONSTER! SINCE HE'S STARTED WORKING ON HIS BOAT, HIS APPETITE HAS DOUBLED. HE INHALES OUR FOOD! SIX BEEF ANIMALS, 30 SHEEP, TEN LOAVES OF BREAD AT A MEAL... THEY'RE NOTHING TO HIM. I CAN EARN MY WAY. I'LL WORK FOR MY FOOD. YOU'LL STARVE US TO DEATH! SIRE, OUR MATHEMATICIANS HAVE DETERMINED THAT HE IS EQUAL IN SIZE... TO 1,728 OF OUR OWN PEOPLE, AND HE EATS AS MUCH AS 1,728. I SAY POISON HIM. NO! YOUR MAJESTY, HE CAN DO THE WORK OF 1,728. THE MORE HE WORKS, THE MORE HE EATS! WE HAVEN'T ENOUGH LAND TO GROW THE FOOD FOR HIM. I'LL CLEAR MORE LAND FOR YOU... RIGHT THERE. THERE'S A FOREST YOU SHOULD BE GROWING CROPS IN. I TOLD YOU HE WAS MAD. WHOEVER HEARD OF GROWING CROPS IN THE FOREST? LOOK! THE GIANT MAN HAS ENORMOUS STRENGTH! I'LL LEAVE A FRINGE OF TREES AROUND THE EDGE FOR A WINDBREAK, AND ALSO SOME IN THE SOUTH QUARTER FOR A WATERSHED. MAKE WAY FOR THE EMPEROR! ALL HAIL THE EMPEROR! ALL HAIL THE EMPEROR!

I'M BIGGER THAN ANY FLEET, AND I DON'T EVEN NEED A BOAT TO GET OVER THERE. WHEN THEY SEE ME, THEY'LL BE SO FRIGHTENED, THEY WOULDN'T DARE ATTACK. NO, THEY WOULDN'T!

I HATE EGGS. - IT'S THE PRINCIPLE OF THE THING. - YOU CAUSED ALL THIS TROUBLE, ENDANGERED YOUR DAUGHTER'S LIFE JUST TO WIN A SILLY POINT? BUT YOU PROMISED THE GIANT WOULD SOLVE ALL OUR PROBLEMS. AND HE WILL. GULLIVER, YOU'RE THE BIGGEST AND THE STRONGEST. YOU MAKE EVERYONE OPEN THEIR EGGS FROM THE END YOU CHOOSE. NO ONE IS BIG OR STRONG ENOUGH TO STOP YOU LILLIPUTIANS FROM YOUR BICKERING. IT POISONS EVERYTHING YOU THINK AND SAY AND DO. THEN MAKE EVERYONE THINK THE WAY YOU DO. THAT'LL STOP THE BICKERING... AND THE WAR. NO, RELDRESAL. DON'T YOU SEE? THEN I'D BECOME JUST LIKE THE EMPEROR, AND SO WOULD YOU... MAKE WAY FOR THE EMPEROR! USING MY STRENGTH TO OPPRESS OTHERS. - TREASON! - FALSE PRIDE AND VANITY DESTROY EVERYTHING FOR LOVERS. OH, ELIZABETH WAS RIGHT. THE ONLY SAFETY IS IN BEING OBSCURE, IN BEING NOTHING. - DOWN WITH FORCE AND POWER! - KILL HIM! CALL THE GUARDS! PLEASE. I-I NEED YOUR HELP. HALT! I MUST SHOW THIS TO THE KING. WELL, SEE THE KING'S CHAMBERLAIN. WELCOME TO THE KINGDOM OF BROBDINGNAG, GULLIVER. DON'T BE FRIGHTENED, DARLING. YOU'RE SAFE. IS THAT HIS NAME... GULLIVER? YES, MY DEAR. HE BELONGS TO ELIZABETH. SHE'S TOLD US ALL ABOUT HIM. OH. ANOTHER OF THE PRIZED POSSESSIONS OF YOUR KING. ONE OF HIS GREATEST TREASURES. SIRE, I KNOW HOW HIGHLY YOU VALUE THESE LITTLE PEOPLE, BUT I MUST WARN YOU: LITTLE PEOPLE ARE SHRUNKEN PEOPLE, AND SHRUNKEN PEOPLE ARE DANGEROUS PEOPLE. MAKOVAN, SHRUNKEN PEOPLE ARE LITTLE PEOPLE, AND LITTLE PEOPLE ARE TOY PEOPLE, AND NO ONE IN THE ENTIRE LAND OF BROBDINGNAG HAS THEM, EXCEPT ME. ELIZABETH, TAKE YOUR GULLIVER INSIDE. HE NEEDS FOOD AND REST. AND THE COURT TAILOR WILL MAKE HIM NEW CLOTHES. YOU'RE GOING TO BE VERY RICH, MY GIRL. VERY RICH. - WHAT DID YOU SAY YOUR NAME WAS, DEAR? - GLUMDALCLITCH. HUH? THERE YOU ARE, PRETTY ONE. THAT OUGHT TO KEEP YOU AND YOUR PARENTS HAPPY FOR MANY YEARS TO COME. BUT I DON'T WANT TO SELL HIM. I ONLY BROUGHT HIM BECAUSE YOUR LAW SAYS, "ANYONE WHO FINDS LITTLE PEOPLE... SHOULD BRING THEM TO THE PALACE AT ONCE." THAT'S QUITE RIGHT, DEAR. ONLY THE KING CAN OWN LITTLE PEOPLE. BUT HE'S MINE! I FOUND HIM! NOW, MY DEAR CHILD, I'VE GOT A SURPRISE FOR YOU. COME ALONG WITH ME. WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THESE, HMM? YOUR KING'S COLLECTION OF THE TINIEST ANIMALS IN THE WORLD. THEY'RE VERY NICE. NICE? WHY, THEY'RE THE MOST UNUSUAL COLLECTION EVER GATHERED. COME AND SEE MY FAVORITE. SEE THIS TINY CROCODILE? HE'S THE FIERCEST FIGHTING FLESH OF HIS SIZE IN CAPTIVITY. WATCH. SEE HOW HE SNAPS AT IT? THAT'S WHY WE KEEP HIM ALONE. HE'D KILL ANY OF THE OTHERS IN AN INSTANT. NOW, AS A REWARD, I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU... ANY ONE OF THESE LITTLE ANIMALS YOU CHOOSE, EXCEPT MY CROCODILE. I DON'T WANT ANY OF THEM. I WANT MY GULLIVER. COME NOW, GIRL. DON'T BE STUBBORN. YOUR KING KNOWS BEST. HE'S A GROWN-UP KING FOR GROWN-UPS. CHILDREN DON'T HAVE A KING TO PROTECT THEM. I'M EVERYBODY'S KING! YOU TAKE THINGS AWAY FROM CHILDREN, LIKE ALL GROWN-UPS. THEY NEVER ASK. THEY JUST TAKE. WHY DON'T WE LET HER STAY HERE? SHE'S MAKE AN EXCELLENT GUARDIAN FOR THEM. ALL RIGHT, THEN I'LL DECREE THAT YOUR PARENTS ALLOW YOU TO LIVE HERE FOR A WHILE. SEE? I'M YOUR KING TOO. THANK YOU. I'LL PROTECT THEM WITH MY LIFE. COME WITH ME, DEAR. I'LL SHOW YOU YOUR ROOM, AND I'M GOING TO GET YOU A LOVELY, NEW DRESS. PAGES, BRING THE CASTLE. YOU NEVER SAW ANYTHING OF CAPTAIN PRITCHARD OR THE CREW AGAIN? AFTER THE ANTELOPE SANK, I WAS WASHED ASHORE HERE. LET'S HOPE THAT THEY WERE SAVED TOO. DARLING, I NEVER STOPPED BELIEVING YOU WERE ALIVE, NOT FOR A MOMENT. WHEN I THINK OF WHAT THOSE HORRIBLE LITTLE PEOPLE MIGHT HAVE DONE TO YOU... THEY WERE VAIN AND SELFISH. YOU'RE SO RIGHT, ELIZABETH. WANTING TO BE IMPORTANT AND POWERFUL IS MEANINGLESS. OUR BEING TOGETHER IS ALL THE IMPORTANCE WE EVER NEEDED. WAIT! ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? IT'S GLUMDALCLITCH, THE LITTLE GIRL WHO FOUND YOU. OH. HOW DO YOU DO? THANK YOU. YOU'RE WELCOME. I'M GOING TO SLEEP NOW. BUT IF YOU WANT ANYTHING, JUST CALL. GOOD NIGHT, DEAR. ISN'T THIS A BEAUTIFUL PLACE? AND NO MORTGAGE EITHER. IT'S A PARADISE COMPARED TO WAPPING. I DON'T CARE WHERE WE ARE, AS LONG AS WE'RE TOGETHER AND SAFE. YOU CERTAINLY GOT YOUR STRENGTH BACK FAST. GIANT FOOD AGREES WITH ME. NO, DON'T. WE'RE NOT MARRIED YET. ELIZABETH, OPEN THE DOOR. ELIZABETH! GLUMDALCLITCH! WAKE UP! GLUMDALCLITCH! GLUMDALCLITCH! WAKE THE KING! WE WANT TO GET MARRIED! MARRIED? NOW? BUT EVERYONE'S ASLEEP. FETCH THE KING! PLEASE! OH, ALL RIGHT. STOP SHOUTING. GROWN-UPS ARE SILLY, AND LITTLE GROWN-UPS ARE SILLIER THAN ANYBODY. WAKE UP IN THERE! WAKE UP! WHY ARE YOU AROUSING THE WHOLE CASTLE? THEY ONLY WANT A SIMPLE CEREMONY. WELL, IF I HAVE TO BE UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, SO DOES EVERYBODY ELSE. YOU'VE FORGOTTEN YOUR SLIPPERS! OH, NEVER MIND THE SLIPPERS! I JUST WANT TO GET THIS OVER WITH AND GET SOME SLEEP! DON'T BE SO GRUMPY, DEAR. REMEMBER WHEN YOU CARRIED ME OFF BY MOONLIGHT? HOW IMPETUOUS YOU WERE! HOW THE FIRES OF PASSION STIRRED YOU. WELL, I WISH THEY'D STIR NOW. IT'S COLD AS A BARN IN THESE HALLS. PLEASE, YOUR MAJESTY. YES, ALL RIGHT. WHERE'S THE BRIDE AND GROOM? THERE THEY ARE, KING BROB. OH. PAGES, GET THAT FIRE GOING! THESE STONES ARE COLD ON MY FEET! THEY'LL MAKE SUCH A DELIGHTFUL COUPLE. AREN'T THEY CHARMING? FORGIVE ME FOR DISTURBING YOU AT THIS HOUR, YOUR MAJESTY. QUITE ALL RIGHT. YOU SURE YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING? NOW, NONE OF YOUR FOOLISH JOKES. - YOU'RE MAKING THEM NERVOUS. - THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE NERVOUS. WHERE'S THE LICENSE? WHERE'D THEY GO, THE LITTLE LOVERS? FOR SHAME! SHAME ON ALL OF YOU! STOP THIS NONSENSE. MARRY THEM AT ONCE. YOU'RE RIGHT, DEAR. I'D BETTER MARRY THEM AT ONCE. I PRONOUNCE YOU MAN AND WIFE... BY THE AUTHORITY VESTED IN ME... BY ME. LIVE HAPPILY, LONG LIFE, LOTS OF CHILDREN, ALL THAT SORT OF THING. HMM? HE SHOULD KISS THE BRIDE. HE IS, DEAR. AND NOW CAN WE GO BACK TO BED? WAKE UP. WAKE UP, SLEEPY-HEADS. IT'S MORNING. NO. OH, DEAR! NO! GULLIVER! ELIZABETH! DARLING, IF WE'RE GONE TOO LONG, GLUMDALCLITCH MIGHT GET INTO TROUBLE. GLUMDALCLITCH IS A BIG GIRL... A VERY BIG GIRL. SHE CAN TAKE CARE OF HERSELF. NO MORE CARES. NO MORE WORRIES. NOT A ONE. ALL I HAVE TO DO IS KEEP YOU HAPPY, AND I'M GOING TO WORK VERY HARD TO DO IT. WORK? WHAT FOR? TO GET MONEY TO BUY FOOD. BUT WE GET ALL OUR FOOD FREE. WELL, THEN TO PAY TAXES, AT LEAST. BUT THERE ARE NO TAXES ON US. WELL, THEN TO SAVE MONEY FOR OUR FAMILY. THE KING WILL GIVE US ALL THE MONEY WE EVER NEED. YES, BUT... WELL, I GUESS SO. I SUPPOSE I DON'T HAVE A THING TO WORRY ABOUT FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE. GULLIVER? ELIZABETH? WHERE ARE YOU? ANSWER ME! ELIZABETH! HERE I AM! DOWN HERE! GLUMDALCLITCH, HURRY! OVER HERE! - GLUMDALCLITCH! - OH! THERE YOU ARE! - WHERE'S GULLIVER? - HERE I AM! DOWN HERE. GLUMDALCLITCH! DOWN HERE! DON'T EVER RUN AWAY AGAIN. THANK YOU FOR SAVING ME. BUT WHY DID YOU RUN AWAY? WE DIDN'T RUN AWAY. SOMEDAY WHEN YOU'RE GROWN UP... I-I MEAN, WHEN YOU BECOME AN ADULT, YOU'LL UNDERSTAND. YOU COULD HAVE BEEN KILLED. DEAR GLUMDALCLITCH, WE'RE SORRY. WE WON'T DO IT AGAIN. I LOVE YOU BOTH SO MUCH, BUT YOU MUST DO WHAT I SAY. YOU MUST BEHAVE OR THE KING WON'T LET ME STAY WITH YOU IN THE CASTLE. I HAVE TO TAKE YOU BACK RIGHT NOW. THE QUEEN IS TERRIBLY WORRIED. YOU UPSET THE QUEEN VERY MUCH. I MUST FORBID YOU EVER TO LEAVE AGAIN WITHOUT PERMISSION. WHERE DID YOU GO? ON OUR HONEYMOON. OH, YOUR COUNTRYSIDE IS AS BEAUTIFUL AND GREEN AS ENGLAND IN THE SPRING. BUT WE WON'T GO WALKING ALONG AGAIN. VERY SENSIBLE, TINY ONE. GLUMDALCLITCH IS HERE TO TAKE CARE OF YOU. I CAN TAKE CARE OF ELIZABETH. GOOD! GOOD! I LIKE LITTLE MEN WITH SPUNK. THERE, MAKOVAN. LET'S SEE THE COURT ALCHEMIST... FIGURE HIMSELF A MAGIC FORMULA TO GET HIMSELF OUT OF THAT. A CLEVER MOVE, SIRE. NO, NO, NO, MAKOVAN. HE'LL TAKE YOUR ROOK IF YOU MOVE THERE. - I BEG YOUR PARDON! - I'M SORRY. I SHOULDN'T HAVE INTERFERED. YOU PLAY CHESS IN YOUR TINY COUNTRY? QUITE OFTEN, SIRE. HE'S VERY GOOD. WELL, LET'S SEE HOW GOOD HE REALLY IS. TAKE OVER MAKOVAN'S GAME. - MAY I STUDY THE BOARD? - OF COURSE. I'M READY, YOUR MAJESTY. THAT'S A STRANGE MOVE. VERY. I'D LIKE TO KNOW MORE ABOUT HIM. TELL ME, WHAT WERE YOU IN YOUR LITTLE COUNTRY, GULLIVER? OH, I WAS A DOCTOR. AH! A WITCHERY DOCTOR. NO, MAKOVAN. A BODILY DOCTOR. I DON'T BELIEVE THAT BAYING AT THE MOON... OR WAVING A DEAD CAT OVER YOUR HEAD WILL CURE A BLADDER AILMENT. STOP THAT JABBERING. IT'S MY MOVE. RIDICULOUS. IMPOSSIBLE. BUT... NOW, I... I CAN TAKE YOUR... NO, NO. THEN YOU CAN TAKE MY... - OH, THIS IS AN IDIOTIC GAME! - YOU'D BETTER LET HIM WIN. YOU WIN! GULLIVER CAN'T HELP IT IF HE'S A BRIGHT LITTLE MAN. AND IT ISN'T LIKE YOU TO BE A BAD LOSER. HIS MAJESTY DIDN'T LOSE. HE WAS TRICKED INTO MAKING FALSE MOVES BY A WITCH. A WITCH, YOU SAY? OH, BUT I COULDN'T HAVE BEEN BEATEN BY SUCH A TINY WITCH. PERHAPS HE WASN'T ALWAYS THAT SMALL. A WITCH CAN MAKE HIMSELF ANY SIZE HE WANTS. OH! HAVE YOU SEEN THE WAY HE KISSES THAT LITTLE WOMAN OF HIS? WITCHES AREN'T INTERESTED IN... THAT SORT OF THING. PRECISELY. DO MARRIED PEOPLE KISS SO HAPPILY? ALWAYS? ALL THE TIME? YOU HAVE A POINT THERE, MAKOVAN. OH! OHH! MY STOMACH! OH, IT HURTS! MAKOVAN, GET ME SOME HERBS QUICKLY! I... OHH! THEY'RE ANGRY WITH US. IT'S PAST TEATIME, AND THEY ALWAYS INVITED ME TO TEA. IS THAT THE PRICE FOR THIS PARADISE, GIVING UP OUR DIGNITY? YOU COULD'VE LOST THE CHESS GAME. THAT ISN'T LOSING YOUR DIGNITY. IT'S PRETENDING TO BE STUPID. AND IF THAT ISN'T LOSING YOUR DIGNITY... AT LEAST YOU COULD TRY TO HUMOR THEM. I COULD DO MORE. I COULD EDUCATE THEM. THEY ARE SO BACKWARD, THEY'RE LIVING IN THE MIDDLE AGES. NOW, DON'T TRY TO CHANGE THEM. THAT'D SPOIL EVERYTHING. WE'RE HAPPY HERE. WE CAN'T BE HAPPY AS LONG AS WE'RE NOBODIES. YOU TRY TO BE THEIR EQUAL, THEY'LL HATE US. AND IF I DON'T, THEY'LL LAUGH AT US. AND IF THEY LAUGH AT US LONG ENOUGH, THEY'LL GET BORED WITH US. AND IF THEY GET BORED, THEY'LL STOP LAUGHING. AND SINCE THAT'S ALL WE'RE HERE FOR, THEY'LL GET RID OF US. SHH. THE QUEEN IS ILL. WHEN? WE JUST LEFT HER. I SAW THEM CARRY HER DOWN THE HALL TO HER QUARTERS. WHO'S TAKING CARE OF HER? MAKOVAN. THAT QUACK. SHE NEEDS A DOCTOR. NO, LEMUEL, PLEASE. SHE'S HEALTHY. SHE JUST EATS TOO MUCH. PLEASE! WAIT! GLUMDALCLITCH, TAKE ME TO MAKOVAN'S LABORATORY. OH, I CAN'T DO THAT. THE KING WON'T ALLOW IT. IT'S FORBIDDEN. DO AS I SAY, GLUMDALCLITCH! BUT IT'S AN EVIL PLACE, FILLED WITH MAKOVAN'S MAGIC. BUT I'M GOING TO TURN HIS MAGIC INTO MEDICINE. GULLIVER, NO! YOU'LL BE KILLED! DON'T WORRY. THIS IS OUR BEST CHANCE TO LIVE HAPPILY EVER AFTER, FOREVER AND EVER. GLUMDALCLITCH, TAKE ME THERE. OHH! THIS WILL SOOTHE YOU. MY SPECIAL FORMULA MADE OF SPIRITS OF THERIAC. IT'S TOO HOT, YOU FOOL! IT MUST BE HOT, YOUR MAJESTY! IT'S NOT HELPING HER, MAKOVAN. TRY ANOTHER FORMULA. KING BROB? PLEASE, KING BROB, LET DR. GULLIVER HELP HER. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? GO AWAY, CHILD. GULLIVER. JUST RELAX, YOUR MAJESTY. I'M A PHYSICIAN, A DOCTOR, AND I'M GOING TO HELP YOU. - I'M DYING. - YOU ARE NOT DYING, DEAR WOMAN. YOU MERELY HAVE AN UPSET STOMACH. BUT IT ACHES SO. I HAVE PREPARED A SIMPLE SOLUTION OF LAUDANUM, A PAREGORIC. DRINK IT, AND YOU'LL FEEL BETTER IMMEDIATELY. ARE YOU SURE, DOCTOR? I KNOW IT WILL CURE YOU. I'M STAKING MY LIFE ON IT. AS A PHYSICIAN, I WISH I COULD TAKE MADAM'S HAND AND SOOTHE HER. YES, DOCTOR. NOW, THE MEDICINE IS ON THE TABLE BESIDE THE BED. YOU'LL DRINK IT DOWN LIKE A GOOD GIRL. YES, DR. GULLIVER. SHE'S CALLING FOR THE LITTLE MAN. SHE'S LOSING HER MIND! NO, KING BROB. HE'S GOING TO HELP HER. HE'S A DOCTOR. HELP HER? THAT LITTLE WITCH? WHERE IS HE? PUT IT DOWN! NO, NO! GO AWAY, MAKOVAN. - ALL OF IT, MADAM. ALL OF IT! - YES, DOCTOR. IT'S WITCH'S BREW. HE'S POISONED HER! NONSENSE, MAKOVAN! SHE NEEDED HELP ON THE INSIDE, NOT THE OUTSIDE. THERE HE IS. CATCH HIM! STOP IT, MAKOVAN! AH. I FEEL MUCH BETTER ALREADY. - ARE YOU SURE, DEAR? - THE PAIN IS COMPLETELY GONE. YOU GAVE ME THE SCARE OF MY LIFE, DEAR. ALL OF YOU, LEAVE. I WISH TO CONSULT WITH GULLIVER. YOU MAY LEAVE TOO, DEAR. GULLIVER WILL BE SAFE HERE WITH ME. I SAID I'D LIKE A FEW MINUTES ALONE WITH MY PHYSICIAN. - YOUR WHAT? - MY DOCTOR. DR. GULLIVER. WELL, I... I CAN TAKE CARE OF YOU. GET THAT MAN OFF YOUR BED. YOU DIDN'T SAVE MY LIFE. HE DID. BUT I'M YOUR HUSBAND. I WANT MY DOCTOR. ALL RIGHT, THEN! I'LL TAKE MY DOCTOR! DR. MAKOVAN, COME WITH ME. I TOLD YOU HE WAS A WITCH, SIRE. SHALL I BURN HIM? IT'S NOT FAIR TO BURN A WITCH WITHOUT PROVING HE'S A WITCH. WELL, DO YOU WANT ME TO BURN HIM FIRST, THEN PROVE HIM A WITCH? OR SHALL I PROVE HIM A WITCH, THEN BURN HIM? BUT I DON'T WANT THE QUEEN UPSET. THAT'S WHAT I WANT. THEN I SHALL PROVE HIM FIRST AND THEN BURN HIM LATER. IS THAT WHAT YOU WISH, SIRE? MUST I ALWAYS TELL YOU WHAT TO DO, WHAT NOT TO DO? SHOW A LITTLE INITIATIVE. CAN I WATCH WHEN YOU MAKE HIM A WITCH? I'M NOT MAKING HIM A WITCH, SWEETNESS. HE IS A WITCH, AND DADDY'S JUST PROVING IT. CAN I WATCH? ARE YOU GOING TO BURN HIM AFTERWARDS? CAN I? WITCHES ARE ALWAYS BURNED AT MIDNIGHT, SHRYKE, MY DARLING, AFTER YOUR BEDTIME. I-I WAS TOLD TO BRING DR. GULLIVER HERE. YES, OF COURSE, MY DEAR. JUST PUT HIM DOWN ON THE TABLE. NOT WITH THAT CAT HERE. I'D BETTER KEEP HIM IN MY BASKET. THE THING'S A DOLL! YOU SENT FOR ME, MAKOVAN? CAN I BE OF SOME SERVICE? PERHAPS. OH, THIS IS MY DAUGHTER SHRYKE. DARLING, THIS IS GLUMDALCLITCH, GUARDIAN OF THIS LITTLE, UH... HE'S NOT A DOLL. HE'S MY LITTLE MAN. I MAY NOT BE BIG ENOUGH TO BE YOUR FATHER, BUT I AM OLD ENOUGH. HE'S SILLY-LOOKING, AND HE SQUEAKS LIKE A MOUSE. YOU'RE JUST JEALOUS BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE ONE. NOW, NOW, GIRLS, BOTH OF YOU GO OUTSIDE AND PLAY. KING BROB TOLD ME NEVER TO LEAVE GULLIVER WHEN HE'S AWAY FROM HIS CASTLE. OUT, I SAID. THERE WILL BE HONEY CAKES AND MILK FOR BOTH OF YOU LATER. IT'S ALL RIGHT, GLUMDALCLITCH. WE HAVE GROWN-UP, SCIENTIFIC MATTERS TO DISCUSS. WHAT SUBSTANCE IS THAT? AIR, WATER, FIRE AND EARTH. PLUS THE FOUR SPIRITS OF ANCIENT ALCHEMY: MERCURY, SULPHUR, ARSENIC AND SAL AMMONIAC? YOU KNOW ABOUT THEM? ANY CHEMIST KNOWS THE DEBT WE OWE TO THE SORCERERS AND MAGICIANS. THEN YOU KNOW MAGIC. THEY CALLED IT MAGIC WHEN THEY TRIED TO USE... CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS TO CHANGE IRON INTO GOLD, BUT WE CALL IT CHEMISTRY NOW. YOU HAVE THE SECRET OF MAKING GOLD OUT OF IRON? I THINK IT WOULD BE EASIER TO MAKE A SILK PURSE OUT OF A SOW'S EAR. YOU CAN DO THAT TOO? STOP THAT! GIRLS! STOP IT! STOP THAT, I SAID! EASY, NOW. DADDY LOVES HIS LITTLE BABY. THERE, THERE. DR. GULLIVER, MAKOVAN IS GOING TO PUT YOU INTO THOSE TANKS. YOU'LL TURN BLUE, AND THAT'LL PROVE TO HIM YOU'RE A WITCH. AND THEN HE'LL KILL YOU. DON'T BE ALARMED, GLUMDALCLITCH. I CAN HANDLE MAKOVAN. BUT EVERYONE HE SAYS IS A WITCH... THEY TURN BLUE IN THOSE MAGIC WATERS. WHAT DID YOU DO? YOU'RE NOT A WITCH, ARE YOU? NO, GLUMDALCLITCH. THERE, THERE, MY SWEET. THERE! NOW, YOU LEAVE HER ALONE, YOU LITTLE BULLY. NOW SIT HERE, MY SWEET, AND WATCH ME TURN THE LITTLE MAN BLUE. CAN I STAY UP LATE TONIGHT AND SEE THE FIRE? TURN BLUE? ME? AN INNOCENT MAN? ANYONE WITH A SHRIVELED BRAIN WHO CAN BEAT THE KING AT CHESS, WHO CAN CURE A QUEASY QUEEN, WHO CAN MAKE A SILK PURSE OUT OF A SOW'S EAR, MUST TURN BLUE. CLIMB DOWN INTO THAT PAN. THAT'S ENOUGH. GET INTO THE NEXT ONE. - CLIMB OUT, GULLIVER. - YES, SIR. HE DIDN'T TURN BLUE! HE DIDN'T TURN BLUE! INCREDIBLE! MERELY THE LAW OF PREDICTABLE CHEMICAL REACTION. THE FIRST BEAKER CONTAINS LICHEN, WHICH FEEDS ON ALGAE ROCKS. ANYONE STEPPING INTO LICHEN AND THEN INTO A BEAKER CONTAINING ANY ALKALINE COMPOUND... MUST TURN BLUE. BUT YOU'RE RED. OF COURSE. I CHANGED THE ALKALINE SOLUTION TO ACID. ACID WILL THEN TURN ANYTHING RED. AMAZING WITCHERY. IT'S STILL COLORLESS. IT'S THE SAME PRINCIPLE AS YOUR EXPERIMENT, BUT IT WILL STILL TURN YOU RED. NEVER. GULLIVER, THE CAT! MY CAT! YOU'VE TURNED HER RED! OH, NO! THERE, THERE, MY SWEET! DADDY DIDN'T DO IT. THE WITCH DID IT. NOW YOUR HAIR WILL TURN RED, MAKOVAN, SURE AS SCIENCE IS SCIENCE, AND I'M NOT A WITCH! IT'S TURNING! IT'S TURNING! IT IS, DADDY. IT'S RED. YOUR HAIR! LITTLE WITCH, YOU'LL MAKE A SHORT BUT COLORFUL FLAME! WHERE DOES HE GET SUCH POWER... TO TURN MY HAIR RED, TO CURE THE QUEEN? I SAY DESTROY THE WITCH, SIRE, BEFORE HE DESTROYS US! BUT IT WASN'T MAGIC! HE'S NOT A WITCH! INVISIBLE SPIRITS. EVIL SPIRITS! MAKOVAN COULDN'T HAVE TURNED HIS OWN HEAD RED, BUT YOU DID. ONLY BECAUSE I KNOW SCIENCE AND CHEMISTRY. THERE IS NO SUCH THING. IF THERE WAS, I SHOULD KNOW IT. NO ONE CAN KNOW EVERYTHING. WHAT MY SORCERER DOESN'T KNOW DOESN'T EXIST. BROBDINGNAGIANS ARE THE WISEST AND STRONGEST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD, AND I'M THEIR KING, DO YOU UNDERSTAND? NOW, ADMIT YOU NEVER BEAT ME AT CHESS. BY FAIR MEANS, I MEAN. IF I DENY THAT I KNOW WHAT I KNOW... AND SEE WHAT I SEE AND HEAR WHAT I HEAR, THEN I DENY ALL KNOWLEDGE, SIRE. WHAT HAPPENS IF THE QUEEN GETS A STOMACHACHE AGAIN? THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS. NOTHING! DO YOU UNDERSTAND? GET THAT THROUGH YOUR LITTLE THICK HEAD! DENY ANYTHING THEY WANT! SAY ANYTHING THEY WANT, BUT SAVE YOURSELF! I CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT YOU. OPEN THE CAGE. I'M READY TO CONFESS EVERYTHING. CONFESS THEN. I CONFESS THAT THE SUN GOES ROUND THE EARTH. I CONFESS THAT THE WORLD IS FLAT. I CONFESS THAT THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS MEDICINE... OR SCIENCE. AND ADMIT THAT IT WOULD TAKE A WITCH TO BEAT ME AT CHESS. IT WOULD TAKE A WITCH. NOW HE'S MORE GUILTY THAN EVER. HE ADMITS THERE WAS NO MEDICINE, SO HE CURED THE QUEEN WITH NOTHING. ONLY A WITCH COULD DO THAT. WE MUST BURN HIM AT ONCE. I'M AFRAID WE MUST. I'M SORRY. YOU PROMISED THAT I WOULD BE SPARED. YOU LIED! YOU WEAR THE TERROR AND THE FEAR OF THE IGNORANT. - WHAT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU WANT TO DESTROY! - BURN HIM. NO! WAIT. I HAVE A BETTER WAY TO DESTROY A WITCH. REMARKABLE IDEA, SIRE. THERE WON'T EVEN BE AN ASH REMAINING. NO. NO! GO BACK TO BED, CHILD. NOW, GO BACK TO BED. ELIZABETH MUST BE SPARED. SHE'S DONE NOTHING. THEY'RE BOTH ALIKE, SIRE. ON WITH IT! ON WITH IT! LEAVE HER THERE FOR NOW. OPEN THE DOOR OF THE CAGE. DR. GULLIVER, TAKE THIS. COME ON! COME ON NOW! HOLD HIM! KILL HIM! HIT HIM AGAIN! HIT HIM! SEE WHAT POWERS HE HAS, SIRE? THE STRENGTH OF A DOZEN HIS SIZE. BURN HIM! GULLIVER! ELIZABETH! AFTER THEM! STOP HER! DON'T LET THEM GET AWAY! THEY'RE COMING. WHERE SHALL I HIDE YOU? YOU CAN'T STAY ALONE HERE. THE ANIMALS WILL EAT YOU. YOU CAN'T DO ANY MORE, GLUMDALCLITCH. SAVE YOURSELF. THEY'RE NOT HERE! WHERE ARE THEY? WHERE DID YOU HIDE THE WITCHES? I DON'T KNOW! I DON'T KNOW! OH, LEAVE THAT SILLY CHILD ALONE! THEY'RE SOMEWHERE DOWN HERE. FIND THEM! THEY MUST BE SOMEWHERE HERE. WE CAN'T LET THEM ESCAPE! SET LIGHT TO THE BRUSH. BURN THEM! WE'RE GOING TO DIE HERE. OH, IF ONLY I'D LISTENED TO YOU. IF ONLY I HADN'T TRIED TO MAKE YOU LIVE MY WAY. NO. IF ONLY I HADN'T LEFT WAPPING AND WANTED EVERYTHING MY WAY. THERE THEY ARE! AT THE STREAM! HURRY! INTO THE BASKET! WHERE ARE WE? I DON'T KNOW. WAS IT A DREAM? AS REAL AS ANYTHING WE THINK. BUT THE GIANTS? WHAT IF THE GIANTS COME BACK? THEY'RE ALWAYS WITH US... GIANTS AND THE LILLIPUTIANS... INSIDE US. THEIR TERRIBLE WORLD WAITING TO TAKE OUR LIVES, WAITING FOR US TO MAKE A MISTAKE, TO BE SELFISH AGAIN. HOW CAN WE BEAR IT? HOW CAN WE LIVE WITH SUCH FEAR? WITH LOVE, THE WAY GLUMDALCLITCH DID. GLUMDALCLITCH. WHAT HAPPENED TO HER? SHE'S WAITING TO BE BORN. YES. WE'RE BACK IN OUR WORLD! PARDON ME, SIR. WE'RE LOST. PERHAPS YOU'VE HEARD OF OUR COUNTRY FROM A WANDERING SOLDIER OF FORTUNE... OR A SAILOR WHO TRAVELS THE SEAS. WE COME FROM A FAR-OFF COUNTRY CALLED ENGLAND. AND A TOWN CALLED WAPPING, BY THE SEA. ARE YOU BALMY, GUV'NOR? THIS IS ENGLAND! AND WAPPING'S JUST THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT WOOD. THANK YOU. THANK YOU, SIR.
