You go on up 43 and I didn't hear any, so I jumped let me know. Ten four. I just wanted to know if you should be put back 76 to Cabana Circle, or to the subject's address? Copy, 23 back on the Tom property on 66 on the Lade Road address? I'll see if I can find the address, Ten four. 4491120. No. Alright, 1.1 thank you? Ten four. We're in position, I repeat, we're in position, over. Go ahead and send them our way, boys. Over. Freeze! Don't move! Don't you dare move! On your knees! Now on the ground. On the ground, now! Hands behind your back. Hey boys, we got him. I repeat, we got him. The other one got away. They must split up. Grab him, we'll take this one back to the station. Over. Did you read him his rights? He knows them. This is Terry Miles reporting live from Wounded Knee. Pan Indian activist group known as the American Indian Movement, or AIM, has seized the town of Wounded Knee on the Pine Ridge Reservation. Twelve hostages have been taken including a Roman Catholic priest. The occupation follows an unsuccessful effort to oust elected tribal President, Dick Wilson, who activists accused of corruption and patronage. Dick Wilson and his brother have also been accused of stifling dissent through a private militia, known as the Guardians of the Oglala Nation, or GOONs. Besides his current troubles, the site has attracted national attention due to its symbolic value as the site of the now infamous 1890 Wounded Knee massacre. The past is not far from activist's demands either. Protesters have demanded the reopening of Treaty Negotiations with the U.S. government that ceded significant amounts of territory to the Native Americans. The Marshal Service, FBI, and other law enforcement agencies have closed off road to activists on both sides. Meanwhile, Senators George McGovern and Jim Abourezk will fly back from Washington tomorrow to negotiate a peaceful resolution to the standoff. Personal property? No, no watch. Nothing. We arrested you for disorderly conduct, however, you already have an outstanding warrant for aggravated assault. Do you have anything to say at this time? We have orders to keep you here until the trouble out there stops. Alright, stand up. Every trip was an adventure in those days, and one thing you could always depend on. I've got to go, Frank. It's your watch tonight. It's chilly outside. Goodnight, Frank. Hey... say hello to her for me, will you? How she doing? She's going to be fine, Henry, trust me. See you tomorrow. I'm sure the two of you have a lot to talk about. Hey, Marv, long time no see. Hey, One Bull. Did you hear the charges, Marv? How many times we got thrown in jail? Alcatraz... And DC. In fucking Custer. Now this shithole. Big ole mess out there. Love it. The standoff at Wounded Knee intensified after an exchange of gunfire on the reservation. U.S. Marshal Lloyd Grimm was wounded and remains in critical condition at the Fitzsimmons Hospital. What began originally as a peaceful occupation has degenerated into an armed insurrection, pitting 300 FBI agents against 200 members of the American Indian Movement. Representatives from the Bureau of Indian Affairs are frantically trying to find a peaceful resolution to the conflict. Fucking criminals. Oh, this will be over in a few days. You should not believe what they say on TV. Had we not had secret negotiations prior to the Soviet summit... Eat that. Had we not had secret negotiations over a period of time with the Chinese leaders... no China initiative, there would have been no limitation of arms for the Soviet Union and no summit. And had we not had that kind of security, and that kind of secrecy that allowed for the kind of exchange which is essential, you men would still be in Hanoi rather than Washington today. And let me say, I think it is time in this country to quit making national heroes out of those who steal secrets... Your lawyer is here. I'll call if I need anything. Hi, I'm Claire Chapman. I've been assigned to represent you. You were arrested and charged with disorderly conduct by the County DA's office. Let's go over this first. I assume it's related to Wounded Knee? Where'd you get your law degree from? University of Chicago. Professor Lebowski. Yeah, I studied under him also. Well, I've done a bit of initial research, consulted some of my colleagues and it appears that the authorities were arresting anyone who even came near Pine Ridge. They arrested them whether or not they intended to bypass the blockade. The second charge is more serious. You've been charged with aggravated assault against Mr. Gary Winston. I have the complaint here. This could mean significant jail time. I really need to hear your side of the story. Well... several witnesses claim that you accused the Winston brothers of ordering the murder of Anna Ward. My notes indicate she was a publisher and a noted Indian activist. She died in a car accident ten months ago. Naturally, her death aroused a great deal of suspicion. Mr. Brown... what was your relationship with Anna Ward? Well... now you have a charge against you, with witnesses. If you suspected foul play, why didn't you pursue the standard legal channels? You're apparently a well-known lawyer for the Indian cause. You have a reputation, some power. You think we can just go to the police and file a complaint just because an Indian was killed? You know how many of us are killed each year on the res, right under their nose? Yeah, but this has nothing to do with our case. Of course, it does. Anna was my cousin, and that guy you're talking to is her husband. I'm sorry. Your name's not... We never made it legal. It was a Lakota ceremony. You probably know... the DA has a weak case against you. We can get you out of here. What about those guys who killed Anna? How come they're out there killing people while we rot in jail? Those goons can look you in the eye and tell you how many Indians they fucked up last night. Everything alright, Ma'am? Yeah, I'm fine. We were just talking. Let me get to work on this. I'll be back in a few days. Officer, I'm ready to leave now. Hey, sorry bro, she didn't have to bring up Anna. I'm thinking about her all the time, anyway. Hey, Marv, it's kind of strange how we always get stuck together in the same jams, hey? It's kind of like a family tradish', huh? I wish I had a family. You're my cousin. That ceremony means you're a member of my family forever. That was the best day of my life. Anna was so beautiful. I didn't give her father any horses. I didn't give her the claws of a grizzly bear. On a spring day... the promise will be kept... until we meet... for starting them... Your song will be in them... Your happiness will come to me... We'll praise you... Hey, you know, marrying an Indian doesn't make you Indian. Pale face. Along with Dennis Banks, Russell Means has been the most prominent spokesman for the American Indian Movement during their occupation. So... How's Betty doing? She's stopped eating. They're trying to feed her with a tube, but she's... She's still under 80 pounds. She's talking a bit though. She still recognizes me. She's going to get through this, Henry, okay? Take care of yourself. Hello? This is Mr. Carson from the office of Indian affairs in Washington. Well, yes, sir. I'd like to come... Absolutely, sir. Tomorrow? It's no problem. See you tomorrow. Alright, inspection! Get up out of those beds and face the wall. Now! I said get up and get out of that bed. Face the wall. Drop the blanket. Alright, all clear. Drop the blanket. Drop the damn blanket. I'm doing smoke signals over here. Three puffs means something's wrong. Is something wrong? How'd you like three puffs of this? Because in here, this means you've done something wrong. You see this? Those that did it are no longer breathing. They're at the bottom of the Saigon River. You must be Mr. Brown? I'm James Carson, Special Advisor to the Nixon administration on Indian Affairs. May I come in? Have you been following the events at Wounded Knee? It's all over the news. It's dark on the inside here. There's no news from out there. Let me show you something. Our latest tracking poll shows that over 50% of the public supports the American Indian Movement. But the trendline is flattened since the violence at Wounded Knee has intensified. Now, strategically speaking, your interest group is losing momentum. It would be in their best interests to call off this siege. Honorably, but expeditiously. This is the best thing that happened to our people for a long time. If so many people support us then why should we fold? I agree with you. And the administration has gotten the message. Nixon is ready to negotiate. We'd like to invite your leaders to the White House. Yeah, let's just have a powwow in Nixon's tepee and sign another broken treaty. Same shit, man. Why are they keeping us here? This feels like a safe house. There are a lot of factions out there we don't even know of. If someone were to know that you were dealing with the government, your lives might be in danger. So, they want to negotiate with us here, in jail? There's an armed insurrection going on. You're safer here. You visit Wounded Knee? Not yet. So, let's go together. We can negotiate on the reservation. Marvin... This is an emergency. The authorities are gearing up for a raid, and I'm not talking about some local cops blowing off some steam. It's federal. M16s, tanks, air supported. Do you want a massacre? Another massacre? The President has a lot of problems in Vietnam, but Nixon... he really gets a bad rap. He's a pacemaker. How well do you know Nixon? Well, I have his ear. Is he insecure? Distant? - What do you mean... - Isn't it dangerous to have a president who bugs his enemies? Who's pathologically secretive? He fears his own cabinet. He's completely divorced from reality. He sent me here to help you find a solution. He sent you here on a political mission to score victory. What about you, then? I don't care much what happens to me. Well then, if it's all the same to you, perhaps you won't mind signing this petition. Let me guess. Sign this and the DA drops all charges. Case closed. It's a happy ending. Is this how justice works? Mr. Carson, are we in protective custody? For now. What do you think a judge will say? Throw us in here like a couple murderers. So, let's stay in jail. Face your contradictions. We have them. Oh, absolutely. How did it go? Splendid. Let anyone who wants to see these guys have full access to them. And as a goodwill gesture, we've agreed to give them some radios. Our office will send some in a few days. They need to hear what's going on outside. Sir, the helicopter's ready. The president appreciates your assistance and your discretion. Bye for now. I used to watch that stuff when I was a kid. I was always a cowboy. You kidding? I was always on the Indian's side. Gary Cooper and Jimmy Stewart. You'd never catch me being one of those stupid Indians. All naked and hollering around on those horses. They seemed like losers to me. When we played cowboys and Indians in grade school, I always wanted to be Geronimo Sitting Bull. Oh, gosh, do you remember that movie? Apache? Burt Lancaster played Geronimo. It was like casting a Japanese actor to play Roosevelt. When do you finally get back to your roots? One day I realized where I came from. How my people were cheated. That's why I created the Indian School. One day the government decided to shut down my school. Took all the kids... Took them to white schools. They cut their hair off. And they threw me in jail. They burned it to the ground. Go down with the shit. Every fight... Never criticize your neighbor. Live in peace. Everything on this earth has a purpose. Every disease, an herb to cure it. And every person, a mission. Right? Marv! Courtesy of Uncle Sam. A radio. Hey! Hey, wait a minute. Why does he get the radio, man? Carson said we both get them. Oh, as you said, can't always believe what you hear on the news. Fuck off. - What are you doing? - Get on the ground. Get down. I'm going to teach you to shut up. Let him breath. What? What would you say? Let him breath. He's got problems. Well, I guess everybody's got their little problems. Bud! You okay? Knock it off, white man. Did you notice the white van parked down the road? No. They're just sitting there on the shoulder. I didn't see it. How are the prisoners? Good. They're very good. Any phone calls? Oh, there was a phone call. The phone company was checking the line. It seems to be working. Everything's A okay. I have some news. Are you going to get us out of here, or what? Well, there hasn't been a formal ruling yet, but the judge probably wants you both to post C bonds. Fuck! Given your arrest record, it's probably 50,000 apiece. It doesn't make any sense. We've never had to raise that kind of bail. Obviously, we can file a motion to switch judges. You spent all that time figuring that out? Shit, I'm blown away. But the matter's probably academic. Somebody wants to keep you in here. Now, about Anna Ward... your wife... I think we both know what it's about. It wasn't an accident. Lebowski recommended a forensics consultant to review the photos from the crash. As you can see, the car was hit from the front and not from the back. And here, there's a second set of tire tracks. They're faint but visible. And here, there's some black paint by the license plate. Probably from the car that pushed her into the ravine. I was supposed to be in that truck. I got held up at a meeting. The GOONs had blocked off the road with a pickup. A black pickup. Anna was driving my truck. Her car was in the shop. They wanted to kill me, not her. After Anna's murder... The Wilsons kept harassing me. I snapped. And? Bud and I said we'd kill them at the tribal meeting. As a fugitive, I couldn't necessarily ask police to open up an investigation or Anna's murder. Yeah, but I could go to the coroner. You mean reopen the case? It wouldn't be easy. There are no witnesses, but... Officer! I'll be back in a few days. Faith in the democratic process has been maintained for almost two centuries by 37 men who have successfully completed the journey to the presidency. The Presidential candidates held such sharply opposing views on major issues. McGovern wants to end the Vietnam War immediately... Call if you need to. Hi. We worked together on the Food for Peace program, remember? I do. The Indians call you Great White Chief. You have their respect. Sometimes they tried to make fun of me with their nickname, Paper Chief. So, it looks like you're getting special treatment from Nixon's people. You're a hard man to find. You found me. So, I guess I'm not that well-hidden. What do you want? Have you been following the events at Wounded Knee? It there any progress? No one wants to be the first to blink. We're stuck... on it. Let's work together on this. We could both use a victory. And you want to victory against Nixon. I read they got in touch with you. James Carson, one of Nixon Special Advisors? Oh, Carson. He talks to everybody. Here and there, he has a lot of relationships. Not with much success, I suppose. See, times are changing. I want you on our side. Your side? Or the Democrats side? It's not the same thing to me. We need bold young guys like you on our team. You have the credibility to negotiate a settlement. What are you offering? Protection. I'm sorry about your wife, Marvin. It wasn't an accident. I wasn't in the truck that day. She was. I was the target. Maybe they hit the right target. You mean to tell me I wasn't the target? Well, now you are. You have information. Probably more than you told me. They'll probably want to cut away all the links. That's why I asked if you wanted to be on my side? I know you are a good negotiator, Marvin, I saw you also negotiate the Black Hills possessions. But this is different. Imagine... you're on the top of the mountain. You're going to fall. Now, which side you want to fall down on? This is where you are now. You have to make a choice. Contact me through your lawyer. This is not a game. Be careful. It's a sad day today, especially for the activists at Wounded Knee where tragedy has struck again. Frank Clearwater was mortally wounded by a stray bullet that penetrated the church where he slept last night. While federal agents have attempted to minimize casualties by waiting out the occupation their passive approach has failed to dampen the rising tide of public support for the American Indian Movement. Blah, blah, blah. They picked off a Marshall. We picked off a Redskin. The church is a sanctuary. You don't kill people there. And what about his pregnant widow? Don't get so sentimental, huh. Do you see the newscast about Vets? How these hippies are spitting on us after we come home? You know, they don't like us. So, fuck them. And some of these Indians served in Vietnam too, you know? So, you have to be an Indian to be on TV now? It's just people are finally learning about their mistreatment. These bastards just want their 15 minutes of fame. They just want to be part of this country which historically belongs to them. It's their land, Frank. You've changed, Henry. You've really changed. You know... Sheriff station. Hey, Tom, what'd you got? Well, send him right over. Thanks. Well, it looks like we have a new guest tonight. A nice underprivileged Negro got caught robbing a bank. But it was for the good of humanity, right? Put him in cell three and leave him alone. I'll take care of it in the morning. - Yeah, whatever. - Frank, I mean it. We don't want any trouble this time. Move. Shut the fuck up. All that moaning, you're keeping our neighbors awake. Here, let me help you. Unfortunately, the kids today... They prefer scum like you. That's just too bad. Hey man, are you okay? Get to sleep. Frank, I need to know. Did they bring him in like this, or did you do this? I have to call an ambulance. - How is he? - He isn't good. You need any help? Hey, man. What are you doing, man? He was in here moaning all night. I need you back in your cell. Frank, I can't cover this kind of behavior anymore. He tried to attack me. Self-defense. Don't play that game with me. This is unacceptable. I have to file a report. What exactly are you going to report, Henry? By the way, how's that son of yours? Leave him out of this. Oh well, I certainly remember him in a drug bust, and I kind of forgot to write a report because we were buddies. Right? So, tell me again about that report you're going to file. Don't be a rat. Hey... don't walk away from me when I'm talking to you, you son of a bitch. Don't turn into one of those liberals on TV, bending over for the enemy. Where're you at? Where's my old friend? You have a phone call. He didn't say his name. To celebrities like Rock Hudson and Marilyn Maxwell as they arrive at the premier followed by Doug McClure and Barbara Luna. Then all eyes are on the star. Marlon Brando was accompanied by producer director George Englund and his wife. It's a glittering night in Hollywood... This is the Trans-Lux East showcasing... Hey, Bro who was that, man? A friend of Anna's wants to see me. Shit, the whole world wants to see you, man. How in the fuck do they know where we are? Smoke signals. Hello. I'm the president of the Native American Liberation Committee. I'm here on behalf of Marlon Brando this evening. And he's asked me to give a very long speech. I cannot deliver it because of time, but we will issue a press statement after the ceremony. Marlon regrets he must decline this very prestigious award. His refusal is due to the treatment of American Indians in the media. I'm sorry, especially in regards to the recent events at Wounded Knee. I apologize if I have intruded upon this evening's ceremony and pray that in the future our cause will be met with your support and empathy. Thank you, on behalf of Marlon Brando. Marvin... I was a good friend of Anna's. I couldn't make the funeral, but I always wanted to meet you. I'm afraid I come bearing bad news about Wounded Knee. Things are heading down the wrong path. Some are saying it's a good time to surrender. And some are saying it's a good time to die. Anna was murdered, you know. That's what I heard that it wasn't an accident. Did she say anything important to you before she was killed? All I learned was that she was in... love with you. Did you have an affair with her? I was deeply in love with her. So we both loved her. I first saw her... at a demonstration in Los Angeles. She was speaking to a crowd. She was captivating. And beautiful. She planted a seed... right there. You know, for the first time in my life... she made me feel like I was... like I was a Native American. I'm sure you did a lot for her. She left this bag at my place a while back. It's got some of her personal belongings. You're going to get out of here. I promise you that you're going to get out. Sheriff? Hi. Mrs Frazier's nurse, please. Who's speaking? Yes. Her husband. Sorry, she's still in ICU. Sorry. Yes. Thank you. I've found something else. Anna had a friend named Sherry Summer. Did you know her? I've heard of her. She worked with Anna sometimes, yeah. Well, she went missing a few months before Anna was killed. I got a key to Anna's office at the publishing company. The files are a mess. But I found some memos written by Sherry Summer. About some power company. They strip mined anything and everything near Pine Ridge. Some company dealing with coal and nuclear power. It's up in the Black Hills. The reservation. Yes. But not only that, the Black Hills have rich deposits of weapons grade uranium beneath the bombing range. The federal government started moving families out, freeing up land to be leased. Supposedly for cattle ranchers. The feds were there long before the siege. And then they set those blockades up so quickly. This must have been planned. Yes. Not only that, they were under the table deals with the Winston brothers. They sold land to the power companies beneath market value and pocketed consultant fees. Okay, now we're getting somewhere. The same men who tried to kill you probably murdered Sherry Summer. And they wanted to murder Anna, not me. How do you know that? She was killed for political reasons. She knew too much. Where are the documents now? I took them to my office. Did Sherry have a name for the project? The Sacrifice Zone. The Sacrifice Zone Go back to the files. Look at everything. Get the documents, bring them here. We'll work on it. Claire left a message for you. She said she's alright. Marv, what's wrong? Claire's office was robbed. Most of the documents are gone. Well, she sounded fine on the phone to me. I'm having a friend check her place. It's lights out a few, guys. So hey, at least you have something to read now, right? What are you talking about? Well, your friends bag, I had to search it. It's full of books. Books? I need to call Claire. No calls right now. It's just me tonight. You can call tomorrow. You make the call. I need to see her tomorrow. Please. It's urgent. I'll do what I can. Hey, don't turn out the lights tonight. I haven't read them well. Hey, at least give me a book to read. They turned my office upside down. The documents are gone. There's got to be a leak. Who did you tell about this? The Senator? Look at this. Where did you get this? An old friend of Anna's. The U.S. Secretary planed to turn the Paha Sapa nation into a national sacrifice zone. The Zone would consist of a nuclear energy park with 25 reactors, as well as dozens of coal fired plants that would supply energy as far away as the Great Lakes region. The environmental consequences would be catastrophic. Besides rendering thousands of square miles of pristine wilderness uninhabitable, test drilling has already contaminated the aquifer, poisoning many waterways, ponds, and other sources of drinking water throughout the Dakotas. Nixon signed off on this? They went straight to the top. Everybody had their own agenda. James Carson was in those land deals with the Winston's. Chaos at Pine Ridge. He's involved. This is... dynamite. If you add this to Wounded Knee, things are going to blow up. The administration is going to come after us with everything they've got.

Okay. How much do you know about this? The Sacrifice Zone. It sounds like a thriller. Actually, it's non-fiction. It's in the index. You're mentioned on pages 20, 54, 97, and many others. In fact, there's a whole chapter dedicated to you. So, you've got a book. You know how many crackpots write books about us every week? The author was nice enough to photocopy all invoices, bank statements, checks to Shell Corporation. Now we can trace it right back to your name. And we still have a few documents that your operatives didn't steal. Like the sales commissions to the power companies, for instance. And it describes how many families were displaced. Homes torched. Missing persons. That's liable. I can sue you for this. I believe it's the other way around. We can sue you... For this. And much more. Like the break in to my office. Nixon authorized the Sacrifice Zone. Not me. You advise the president, don't you? I serve my country. Exposing the land to radiation. Polluting the rivers, the soil. Ordering sterilizations. And destroying the nation and its people. Taking away kids from their families. You call that serving your country? Tell me what you want. These are galley proofs. We can get this into bookstores within a week. The Democratic camp would find it very appealing. Get to the point. What do you want? I'm going to give you a way to really serve your country. We can give you a second chance. In other words, you're going to blackmail me? You will use all your influence to abort plans for the Sacrifice Zone on all reservations. The Attorney General will seek an indictment against the Winston brothers for the murder of Anna Ward. I haven't finished yet. Please... sit down. Also, my clients expect to be released immediately and legally. All charges invented must be dropped. And all wiretaps will be removed. Assuming you had a warrant in the first place. An official release will take me a few days... So... proceed. And if anything happens to my clients, or myself, this will be released. Just like that. You took us out of the game to find out what we knew about Anna. And we take you back in the game to live out Anna's will. With a big, long leash. Remember that one. That could be your Indian name. You'll get an official release soon. Sir, we really do need that radio back. We'll get that radio back. We don't want any leaks You're sure you don't want me to call you a plumber. What for? Well, you know, to help fix those leaks. Shut the fuck up! Come on. Today is May 8, 1973. The 71 day Wounded Knee Siege has finally come to an end, with the government making nearly 1,200 arrests. After several months of daily terror and physical hardship, tribal elders finally called an end to the occupation after local Oglala Lakota Lawrence Buddy Lamont was shot by a government sniper. Lamont was buried on site in a traditional Sioux ceremony. After the decision to disarm was agreed upon... They escaped in the middle of the night. In the dead of night, walking across... Cowards. The conflict saw casualties on both sides. Sherriff station. Yeah, hold on. It's the hospital. Yes. This is he. Henry? Betty died an hour ago. Oh, Henry, I... Henry, I'm sorry. Is there anything I can do for you? Hey, don't worry about this place, I got you covered. Let me show them to you. This will be funny. It's special time. Wake up. It's special time. Get up. This is such a cool place for a party. - Yeah? - It's so great. Do you usually only end up here? After the party. You're so... You are bad! - You are really bad. - Oh, my God. What a big handsome man. That's not even the Indian. That one's over here. Come, check him out. Hey! I prefer this one. Woah, hey, what about me, huh? Yeah, check me out because who's the boss here, huh? Are you drunk? Are you fucking crazy? Leave him alone. Hey, what did you say to me? No! Stop it. Take that. Who's the new sheriff in town, huh? One more problem to take care of. Do you what to see what used to do in Saigon? Kill me. Kill me right here. Who won the war? Who won the war? Hey, the show is over. You're insane. It's alright. I told you... How you doing? Let's get another drink. Bud, are you listening? No. Bud, can you hear me? Take something and wrap it... Cover the wound. Bud? You're going to be okay. We're going to call a spirit to your ancestors. Let's call them now, Bud. Let's call them now. Let's call them now. Chief Pale Face. Let's call them now. One Bull is not gonna die. I'm not going to die. - Oh, God! - How is he? He's breathing. Oh, God! Bud! Call an ambulance. Bud, stay with me, buddy. Cousin! We'll get you out of here. Bud! Don't fade, Bud. Stay with me. - One Bull, listen! - The ambulance is on its way. Let's get him out of here. How is he? He's fine. Your friend is in good hands. My colleague has been suspended for two days, so I'll have to run everything here myself, which isn't easy when... My wife is in the morgue. I didn't know. She just passed. She was strong to the end. I have to make some phone calls for the funeral. I'll leave the door open for now. They say you'll be released in a few days. And Henry... Sorry for your wife. The release will be here in a day or two. I'm proud of you. I love you. I love you, too. I'm thinking about the cabin we found. It rained for days. It could have lasted forever. I didn't mind. I liked it. - What's happening? - I got him. He was trying to escape. What did you do? What did you do? He was released today. Henry! What did you do? Officer down! I repeat, officer down! Send ambulance to the Sheriff's substation. The shooter is an escaped prisoner... who's also down. I believe dead. Situation under control. I am poor and naked, but I am the chief of a nation. We do not want riches, but want to teach our children right. Riches would do us no good. We could not take them with us to the Spirit world. Make my hands respected the things that you have made, and my ears sharp to hear your voice. Make me wise, so that I may understand the things you have taught my people. Let me learn the lessons you have hidden in every leaf and rock. Treat the earth well. We do not inherit the earth from our ancestors. We borrow it from our children.
