- Dionne, get in line. Come on, let's go. Are you ready, Stanley? Hit it. Work it. Good, good, hand! Side. And one. Lift it! Stanley get your leg up. (upbeat music) Open your arms! Now! Up! Good! Good. Smile. Yeah, right. Punch the air! Punch, punch, good. Up. Better, Anne, good. Smile, Bianca, yup. Come on, Charlie, get into it. Come on. (clearing throat) Stop the music. Can you take a break? Oh, this is the third time you've been late, Miss Ross. - I know, there was so much traffic and I couldn't find a taxi. - Excuses, nothing but excuses. Everybody else arrived on time. If you keep this up, I'm going to have to substitute you. - May I go change now please? - Okay, but hurry up. Because there isn't going to be a next time. - I promise there won't be. - Okay, can we start again? Okay, this time with energy, okay? Good. Better, good! (tense music) (upbeat music) Five, six, seven, go and one. Do a little leg, and... (tense eerie music) (upbeat music) (tense eerie music) (upbeat music) (gasping) Smile! Oh, god help me, god help me, god damn it. Get into it. Oh, god. Bianca, lift your face. Anna, what are you doing? That's very original, thank you for your improvisation. What's the matter with you, stop! What's the matter with you guys tonight? This show's gonna... Oh my, this show sucks. And the rate you're going, Charles, with the head down, I don't know, we might as well... it's never going on. I don't know what to do. Look, I'm really nervous. Okay. Okay. I'm gonna get her and uh, I'm a little nervous. You have to forgive me, please. Ugh! Go rehearse this without me. I'm gonna get Elizabeth. Can you please? Without me. (upbeat music) I am losing my mind, but I am fed up with these stupid little fake blond bitches who think they can do anything they want to. Miss Ross? This is really the last odd time. (ominous music) (shouting) (tense music) (choking) (croaking) (coughing) (croaking) (shouting) (thudding) (light music) (knocking) - Good morning, and this is for you, Clarissa. But you can't open it till Christmas. - Okay. - Okay. Oh, thanks. - I'll put it under the tree for you, honey. Say hello to Annie for me. - Oh, we will. Come on, dear. Bye! - Bye! - Bye! (upbeat music) - Bryka Chiraskovich is the fourth victim of the hooded psychopath. The woman was also repeatedly raped before being killed. (typewriter clacking) (phone ringing) - Hello? Hello? - Hi, hon. I'm all in a mess. - You're drunk. That's what you are. - I tried the other line but it was always busy. - Then you're drunker than usual. Both lines have been free all day. Anyway, Clarissa has gone to the country with Annie. Listen! I don't have anything to say to you except don't call me anymore! - Melanie. Melanie? Melanie! (shattering) (light music) - Well here you are, Melanie Beck. This is you. You have a daughter. You have a marriage on the rocks, and... nothing but gray skies ahead. (phone ringing) I told you not to call me anymore! - [Man] You're a fine looking woman, Mrs. Beck. Just made to be fucked senseless. - Who is this? - [Man] No, don't move. Stay just like that. Oh, yes. I wanna watch you. With you it'll be different. I won't kill you straightaway. First I'm going to fuck your brains out! (phone slamming) (tense music) - Virginia Beach Police Department. Officer Gabriel here. - Uh, yes. I just got a phone call from a guy spying on me. I think he was calling from the payphone across from my house. - Was it an obscene phone call? - Yes. - Did he threaten you? - Yes. At first he said, well, you can imagine. And then he said he would kill me after that. - Will you let me have your number please? - I have two lines. - Give me both numbers. - Oh yes, um... The first is, uh, 340-3661. And the other is the same digits but ends in 62. - Yes, Miss? - Mrs. Beck, Melanie Beck. - Listen, Mrs. Beck. Lock yourself in the house and don't open the door for anyone. I'll call you back in five minutes exactly. - Okay. - Now you know exactly what you have to do, right? - Yes. First I have to lock myself in and you'll call me back in five minutes. - Good, good, I'll call you back. - Okay, thank you. (tense music) (phone ringing) Hello? - [Man] Hey, Hello, Mrs. Beck, this is Sergeant Gabriel. - But you said you would call me back in five minutes. - I can't wait five minutes, Mrs. Beck. I'm too horny. It's the same for you too, isn't it, Mrs. Beck? Oh, that's it. You figured out where I am. And you've locked yourself in. Oh, that's good. That's very good. Yes. " No! No! Ah, no! Help! Oh, my god! - Come get them, lovely lady. Come on, I'm waiting for you. Oh, it'll be different with you, Mrs. Beck. I'm crazy about your body. I love your skin, your breasts. The way you smell. (phone ringing) - [Man] Yes, Sergeant. Well, when my wife told me, I checked it out right away. Yes, it's obviously some sort of sick-- " No! - [Man] Yeah, it's just as well I got home when I did. I was able to calm her down. Oh, but thank you for calling back, officer. Yes sir, goodbye. (knocking) - [Man] Open up. Open up, you bitch! Open this door! Don't act like this. It'll be all the worse for you! Open up, you whore! - Somewhere!? - [Man] This is only getting worse for you! Open this door! Now you've really got me pissed off, Mrs. Beck! Open this door! - Die, you bastard! (gun firing) (screaming) No! You were dead! - I was pretending. It's all part of the game. Now the fun's about to start. Now it's all out in the open. Are you ready to play, Mrs. Beck? " No! - That woman is our key witness here. She's the only one who's ever seen this guy's face, you know? She's the only one who can identify him. - Well, that's where you're wrong. Yeah, she did see his face but the trauma has completely erased it from her memory. She doesn't remember anything. She's even forgotten her own name. - Well, let's show her the mask. She'll remember this thing, won't she? - It won't mean anything to her. If she can't recognize people, she certainly won't recognize the mask. - Is it true she's even forgotten she's got a daughter? - Yes. We had the child brought in with the hopes that perhaps that will have an effect on her. - Okay, now if that doesn't work, let's just go ahead with the emergency plan. - No, no, no, that's sheer madness. - Well, what are we supposed to do then? Just sit back and watch while this guy goes out and notches up another victim? - Maybe the fact that he was not able to kill this time will calm him. - Yeah, or make him more determined to do it the next time. - We're ready. Come with me, honey. - Doctor, can we please go with her? - That won't be necessary. - But she's just a baby. - I'm sorry. She'll have to go in alone. - Don't worry, I'll be all right. (light music) (equipment beeping) - Melanie. There's someone here who wants to say hello. - Hi. - Hi. - How are you? - Fine. How are you? - When are you gonna come home, mommy? - Soon. Soon. - Clear the room now. We don't want to tire her too much. Well? - What a pretty little girl. - Is that all you have to say? - Yes. I'm tired. - [Old Man] Of course. - The fifth victim, Melanie Beck, the only woman to survive the ordeal has not been seen for the last 24 hours. - Yeah, okay. I'm the guy who saved her. Filthy animal left this little scratch for me to remember him by. - Now I understand that you are one of the key witnesses in this case, and that you could be instrumental in finding this mass murderer? - Unfortunately, I didn't get a look at his face. He came at me with that knife of his, son of a bitch cut my face in half before I laid my hands on him. - Well certainly, Mrs. Beck saw the man's face. After all, he had her in his clutches for more than eight hours. - That poor woman will never be the same again. She doesn't remember anybody or anything. My wife and I have been granted temporary custody of her daughter. This is her daughter Clarissa. - We've been the Beck's friends for the past six years and we always tried to do favors for them whenever we could, even after the divorce. - And Mr. Beck has not been seen around here since the incident? - The fist happy drunk? No one's seen him in God knows how long. Why Sherman and I have practically been raising Clarissa. She's been spending a lot of time over at our house. The Lord hasn't blessed us with any children of our own. - Just think about this. Her father was a cop before he got booted off the force. If I were him, I'd kill that psychopath with my bare hands, you got that? Come on Annie, Clarissa. (chill music) (revving) _ Hey, honey. Sweetheart, woo! Woo! Hey sweetheart, you wanna wet your whistle? (tires screeching) - [Melanie] Looking for me? - I came in here by mistake. What's with the gun? Anybody can make a mistake. - What do you want from me? - I wanna be friends. - You always try to make friends in the ladies' bathroom? - It can happen. - All right. Take off your pants. ' MY pants? - Uh huh. And your socks and your shoes. And now! (gun clicking) Or your career's over. - Okay. Okay. And now? - The shirt. - But what about these? - Throw them in the toilet. - What? - DO it! - And my shirt too, I guess. - You got it. Now flush it. - Flush it? - Flush it! (toilet flushing) Well, so long, friend. - Well, what about my clothes? - Just reach in and fish them out. - There? - Shouldn't be anything new for an asshole like you. You're full of shit yourself! (gurgling) (tense music) - Hey bud, what happened to your clothes? - I got molested in the little boy's room! (energetic music) (tires screeching) What in the hell do you think you're doing? - Committing suicide! - Well, you gotta drink seawater if you're gonna throw up all that shit you've been taking! - Are you crazy? - Drink! (coughing) (retching) (chattering) - You want me to go with you? Where? I wasn't born yesterday. If a stranger asks for something, there's a rat hidden somewhere. It's what my mama always used to say. But seeing as I could never stand the sight of the old lady, I'll come outwith you and risk the unknown. To hell with the old bitch. Here's to the unknown. (tense music) - God. Ugh! No. - Hey, this is incredible. What do you do here? - [Man] I'm really Santa Claus. And if you've been a very good girl all year, I have a big present for you. - Hello? What are you doing? - Guess. - Now, what are we gonna do? - Do you know the story of Little Red Riding Hood? - Sure. Ah, I get it. I'm Little Red Riding Hood and you're the big bad wolf. You know, I think I'm just a little tipsy. - Go on with the story. - Ooh, grandmother, what big paws you have. - All the better to hold you with! - (giggling) What a nutcase. - Don't stop! - Okay. Granny, what a big ugly mug you have. Well? Now you're the one who's stopped. Ooh, why grandmother, what a big schlong you have. I don't like this game anymore. Please, just take me home. (screaming) (grunting) Ah, no, no! (grunting) (ominous music) No, no! (tense music) - Yes, so beautiful, yes. Now. Now, we will make love, Red Riding Hood. Kiss me. " No! No, please open the door, no! No, no, no! - The door was open. Had your sweater and dress cleaned. Fried chicken and French fries. But I don't guess you're too hungry. Ooh, I almost forgot. Valium. Syringe- A gun. Barbiturates! Everything you always needed to kill yourself with but were afraid to ask for. - Just what the hell do you want from me? - I already told you, I just wanna be friends. - Why didn't you just let me drown? - Well. That would have been a hateful waste. - Don't touch me. - No, not again. - You don't seem to get it, Mr. Restroom Hustler. I'm already dead. - Doesn't look that way from here. - That's what you say. - It's a free country. Anybody who wants to kill themselves has the right to. While you shoot yourself... try to... I'm gonna eat. Nothing does it to me like fried chicken. Takes balls to kill yourself. And the only person with those around here in the right place is yours truly. - Oh, yeah? Well, I was doing just fine by the sea! - If I hadn't showed up you would've gone to ask for help. - That's not true! - You're a lucky lady. You've got somebody here to help you. I'll do it for you. (clicking) Come on. This is easy as eating a drumstick. - No. No. Please don't do it. - What do you mean don't do it? Isn't it what you want? - This is what I want! - Well then. Bye bye, sweetheart. (clicking) - (wailing) Just what are you playing at?! - I'm gonna kill you all right. But when I say so! When you least expect it. What do you say? Answer me! - Right. - In the mean time, I'm your master. You'll do everything I say. Is that clear? - Yes. - You know what this means? It means there's a pact. If you don't keep up your end of it, you're death is gonna be a hell of a lot slower than any bullet in the head! Now, I'm gonna go out and let out a little steam. And you're gonna stay right here like a good little wifey. This time I'ma lock you in. - No, no, no, no, no, no, no! Don't lock me in! No! No. (sobbing) (moaning) (wailing) - I have to go now, Miss Morrison. - Don't worry Frank, I'll lock up. But first I wanna check the overflow valve. - All right then. I'll see you tomorrow then, Miss Morrison. - Bye, Frank. Who on earth turned this on? (tense music) Who's there? Frank? (ominous music) (screaming) - Well. I'm the fish, and the fish too far away. Well, I need oxygen, oxygen to live. I want your oxygen. (laughing) (screaming) Oh, yes. (screaming) (tense music) (breathing heavily) (screaming) (lightly tense music) - Wake up. Wake up! I didn't work off enough steam. (tense music) (ripping) - The victim was found at dawn this morning by the security guard of the museum. Okay, here we go! (reporters chattering) Were you afraid it would be done, sir? Wait, did you know? - [Man] Come on, stay back, come on. - [Reporter] What was it about-- - Get back. Get back, get back. - How long has she been here? Did you know her intimately? Did you know her intimately, sir? Have you ever seen her outside the office? (siren sounding) (reporters chattering) - The maniac cut her into pieces and then fed her to the fish. It's enough to make my stomach turn just thinking about it. (reporters chattering) (siren sounding) - The young victim was an employee of the Oceanographic Museum, Pamela Sue Morrison, dead at the age of 25. Pamela Sue Morrison was the sixth victim of the masked maniac who has held our state in a siege of terror for the past six months. All of the victims were raped before they were tortured, mutilated and killed by the masked maniac. - Untie me. - Pretty please? - Untie me, you asshole! - Now. Is that any way to talk? - Okay. Will you untie me, please? - Pretty please! Would you untie me, pretty please. - Fuck you! - No cussing! (slapping) - Pig! Son of a bitch! (tense music) (slapping) - I told you not to use words like that! - Pretty please? Will you? Please now, cut this towel, untie me? - I beg you. - I beg you. - Please. Pretty please. I beg you. Kiss me. - Please. Pretty please. I beg you. Kiss me. (siren sounding) - [Woman] Detective Clark, Detective Clark! Detective Clark, can you make a statement? Is it true that you're in charge of protecting Melanie Beck? - Did you let her slip between your fingers? Do you think the slasher got her? - Listen very closely here, people. Melanie Beck is a free citizen. She's got the right to come and go as she pleases. - But didn't you assign her a personal bodyguard? - No, we did not assign her a personal bodyguard, we are keeping her under protective surveillance, that's all. - But isn't Melanie Beck the only person who can identify this maniac? - Melanie Beck has undergone a tremendous amount of tragedy. She doesn't remember anything about that night. She doesn't remember her own name for Chris-sakes. Look, if you wanna learn more about Melanie Beck, why don't you talk to Dr. Willow, he's been treating her. - How do we get in touch with Dr. Willow? - [Man] Dr. Willow! - Dr. Willow! Dr. Willow, can you make some kind of statement for us, sir? - Melanie Beck is living in a state of dissociative schizophrenia triggered by the trauma of the experience she was forced to undergo. The poor woman went through the most traumatic ordeal a human being can experience. A clinical examination of the patient revealed an inordinate amount of seminal fluid. The pure evil of the violence that was put upon her has unhinged her mind. The patient now has a very fragile grip on reality. - Hasn't Mrs. Beck made various suicide attempts? - Yes, yes. She swallowed a whole bottle of barbiturates and we saved her only by pure chance. - Why would she want to kill herself? - To punish herself. To expiate the sense of guilt that was tormenting her. You see, in those eight hours, the assailant vented all his sadistic rage on her. At first, she resisted him. But by the end she was completely passive. In the end, she accepted it. - Accepted it? - [Dr. Willow] The survival instinct. And paradoxically that's why she wants to commit suicide. To punish that part of her that passively gave in to the onslaught of the maniac. - [Reporter] There are those who believe that the maniac has kidnapped Mrs. Beck and that she is in grave danger. - I sincerely hope not. When I saw Melanie the day before yesterday she was still in a confused state. She might not recognize him immediately. - And what would the consequences be? - The man is an extremely dangerous psychopath. He most likely would put her through the same ordeal. The shock, paradoxically, will bring her back to her senses. But the moment she recognized him, he would kill her. (dramatic music) - How is your girlfriend? Bet she's got one hell of a hangover. - Oh yeah, you can say that again. (shattering) (knocking) - What was that noise?! A gunshot? - We broke the mirror. I hope you're not superstitious. - Listen, I don't want any funny business or I call the police, is that clear? - Don't worry, there won't be any more disturbances. - Hope not, for your sake, bud. And your girlfriend's. - Why did you take so long? Look. I made myself up. I wanted to be beautiful for you. Just for you. - Well. Do you remember? - Yes. I remember. You're the one who's gonna kill me. - Anything else? - Yeah, we found the car, checked the registration. Melanie Beck's all right. A woman fitting Melanie Beck's description was seen in a hotel a few miles from here. Now wait for this, according to the witness she was being followed by a half-naked guy in a jeep. - Yeah, no, I realize that. Okay. Yeah, yeah, this is good. Okay look, let me call you back. I'll call you back. (sighing) He's done it. He's really done it. - God. I hoped it wouldn't actually come to this. - What do we do now? - I don't know. - What do you mean you don't know? We had a specific plan ready here if the guy made a move. But thanks to your TV appearance a while ago you practically gave him the idea. - Don't be absurd. I was only hypothesizing. I didn't think he would really do it. - You're the famous shrink, the famous expert who shot off his mouth on TV with all those highfalutin theories. I'm just a cop, man, who wants to do his job. And I do my job with these! - Listen, you can't blame me for what happened. - I can blame you and I do blame you! Now if you don't do something about this, I'm gonna fix it with the press to make you look like the quack of the century! - All right, I'll speak to the press. - And you'll do it now! - All right, but I warn you, we are dealing with a homicidal maniac here. This could push him over the edge even more and cause more victims! - If we don't stop this guy right now, he's gonna kill again regardless of what we do. You do realize that, don't you? - Yes. (light music) - The police are now convinced that Melanie Beck has been abducted by the homicidal maniac who only yesterday reaped his sixth victim with atrocious brutality. - [Man] could end up, on the next plane back to Panama. John Zirella, CNN Miami. - [Man] We're expecting another briefing from the Pentagon any minute now, and we'll of course keep you posted. Other agencies had a brief interest in the Panama affair as well. The organization of American States is planning an emergency session with the Noriega delegate in attendance. - [Woman] We're expecting Dr. Wilford Willow, who will make a public appeal. Dr. Willow is the psychiatrist who was treating Melanie Beck. Good morning, Dr. Willow. - Good morning, good morning. This is an ultimatum for the murderer who's been terrorizing this county. Your time is nearly up. We are on your tracks. You made a fatal error in abducting Mrs. Beck, an error we were expecting. If you will call 555-7784 within 24 hours, if you will release Mrs. Beck and if you will turn yourself in, the police guarantee you no harm. - Police. - 274, dispatcher, suspect at 34th and Atlantic. Detective Mel headed my way, responding. (tense music) (siren sounding) - Why don't you go on back to the station, okay? Where are they? - They only sent one cop to take care of that maniac? - Hey, I can handle him, just give me that duplicate key. - It's room 70. Here. Wasn't there a reward? - You want a reward? I'll give you 10 seconds to get the fuck out of here or I'll rearrange that wack face of yours, you understand? - Sure, right. Anything you say! - Get out of here! (tense music) (bashing) - Sherman, what are you doing? - Going out. - With a gun? - That crazy bastard who cut my face up, he's out there roaming around somewhere. Now he's got our friend Melanie and he's holding her hostage. - But why do you have to go? Isn't what he did to you already enough? - Annie, I told you. I'm the only one who's seen his face. I'm the only one who can possibly identify him. Now I did just like you said, I haven't told the police anything. - Okay, Okay- We'll tell the police. But leave the gun at home, Sherman! - No, someone's got to stop that crazy bastard. Annie, take it from me, the police are groping in the dark! Now I'm gonna go out there. I'm gonna find that murdering bastard and I'm gonna plug him one right between the eyes! Annie, I'm going. - I'm not letting you go out this door! What about me? What about our daughter? - Our daughter? She's not our daughter. She's Melanie Beck's daughter, remember? - You know what I think? You wanna know what I think? - Oh, don't start this again. - I think the maniac should slit her throat from ear to ear. She's not worthy of our daughter, Clarissa! She's a tramp! She's been laid by everything in a 50 mile radius! Including you, Sherman. - Annie! - Isn't that right? - That's enough, you're out of your mind! - You didn't think that I didn't used to watch you. Your eyes bugged out of your head as she lied there drunk and nude... and practically nude... semi. - [Sherman] Dream on. - [Annie] She attracted that man to her house like a bitch in heat! - I want my mommy! I want my mommy! - It's all right, honey. Mommy's here, it's all right. - You're not my mommy! (dramatic music) - Just wait here a minute, I'll be with you in just a second. - Virginia Beach Police Department. It's him. - No way. That's completely out of the question. - Look, you're the ones who started all this! This time the ball's in my court. - Hey listen here, motherfucker! If you don't let her go right now I'm gonna make you wish you were never born, man. - You neck her? - Well? - Didn't get it. The conversation was too short. - Fuck! (intense music) (light music) (intense music) (honking) (tires screeching) - Melanie! It's me, Sherman. Melanie, Melanie, I'll take you home! Come on. Go, come on. Get in the car. Get in the car. " No! No! - Sit here, Melanie. Sit down. Don't worry about anything Melanie. I'll take care of everything. I'll call the police and I'll be right back with Clarissa. Melanie, Melanie, can you hear me? Okay. Lock yourself in. Don't let anyone in the house till I return, all right? (tense music) (phone ringing) - Hello? - [Man] Do you recognize me, Mrs. Beck? I'm back. " No! (phone ringing) He's here! - She's right when she says you're a bitch in heat, Mrs. Beck. - Now I remember who you are. Oh, my god, now I remember. - I was pretending, it's all part of the game! Now it's all out in the open. Are you ready to play, Mrs. Beck? The fun's about to start! - Sherman. - My wife's right. She's right when she says you attract men like a bitch in heat. Thanks to you, I'm going to be scarred for the rest of my life. You remember how it happened? You can't take it anymore, Mrs. Beck? You can't take it, can you? You want to die. You wanna die, Mrs. Beck. So, why don't you? Why don´t you beg me? Huh? I'll show you how. Sherman, please, Sherman. Please kill me Sherman, I want to die. Now I'll show you how, yes. I have an idea, yes. I'll let you do it. Yes, you'll do it! Just like this, oh, both hands. I'll show you how, yes. Yes, that's it, that's it. Well? Do it. Come on. Do it. You can do it. Now! (screaming) (shouting) (groaning) That was stupid of me. But for you, to think that you could get back at me, to think that you could kill me? That was crazy. (ominous music) No! No! (tense music) No sooner did I get the knife back, then there were people all over the place! - Axel! Axel! - Right. You and Axel. You two tried to set me up! But you didn't succeed. Goodbye, Melanie Beck. - Sherman. Why did it take you so long? I've been waiting for you to come back to me, for you to come back to me. I miss the way you touch me. (moaning) The way you feel me. - Melanie. Oh, Melanie. - My body... needs. I miss the way you touch me. To be with you. One more... real time! (screaming) (groaning) - Now you die, bitch. - No, no! (shattering) (guns firing) - [Melanie] It's... (tense music) - Oh, my god, Melanie. - Axel. Axel. - Hey, can you give me some kind of statement or some kind of story about what happened this morning? Were you first on the scene? Were you first here on the scene? Do you know anything at all? (siren sounding) Who's inside, who's inside? Dr. Willow? Dr. Willow! Detective Clark, can you answer a couple questions for us? Can you tell us what happened? Dr. Willow, weren't you treating the patient for a while? Weren't you treating Melanie Beck? Does this have anything to do with any of the slasher murders at all? Is this the maniac that we've been looking for? Detective Clark, Detective Clark! How did you know that it was Sherman Floyd's body? - We devised a plan together with Dr. Willow to capture the murderer. - Mr. And Mrs. Beck acted as, well, I guess you could say guinea pigs of a sort. - What do you mean by guinea pigs? - One was voluntary, the other involuntary. You see, Mrs. Beck had sublimated her trauma to the point where she couldn't deal with it. She had to relive the experience in order to overcome it. - Well, wasn't that a rather dangerous approach? - I must say that there were some differences of opinion between us and Detective Clark. However, you see it was just a theory of mine. The important thing is that it worked. - But wasn't it Sergeant Beck that was expelled from the force, Detective Clark? - Yeah, he was. But I can guarantee you that after this, he'll not only get his job back, he'll probably get a promotion out of this. - Come on. - A promotion? (reporters chattering) (tense music) - [All] Here's the church. And here's the steeple. Open the doors and there are the people. (laughing) - Mommy, daddy, can I go to my room? - Sure, honey. (whimsical music) Will you ever forgive me? - Forgive you? Of course. You did everything you did out of love. (light music) - I missed you so much. It was hell not being able to talk to you rationally. Not being able to touch you. - Aw. Don't ever leave me again, Axel. (whimsical music) - Melanie, I'm worried about Clarissa, scared. What effect is all this gonna have on her? - Wait, maybe she'll forget, in time. - Time heals. Maybe. (light music) - Do you recognize me, Mrs. Beck? I'm back, just for you. Just for you. (laughing) (light music)
