[discordant piano music] [film projector clicking] [water splashing] [tribal music] ["Hark the Herald Angels Sing"] [wind whistling] - Hey man, better flush your bud. They're gonna search this bus. - They're looking for someone? - No they're not. It's just the snow. - The snow? What snow? There isn't any snow. - The snow in the mountains. ["Deck the Halls"] Don't worry, the bus company will pay. - Yeah, but still, even a Super 8's gonna be 50, 60 bucks. - No, they won't pay for motels. If they can't get through, they'll just take us back to Las Vegas. - Back to, I can't go back. I just, I really have to get to Denver. - Oh Sylvia, come on. Please, Angel, don't cry. There's no way I could have planned for this. I told you that I didn't think I had a shot at winning this, but Scooter missed the Miller flip and I nailed my 540, so I had to wait around for the ceremony. - My girlfriend's getting married. - Oh, are you a bridesmaid? - Yes, yes, I am a bridesmaid. - Oh, that's so exciting. - The thing with the timing belt is true, so is the blizzard. You don't believe me, turn on the Weather Channel. The 15 is closed. They closed the 89 for everything but four-wheel drive vehicles. No, listen, you're missing the point. I have a four-wheel drive vehicle. I am coming. I'm gonna be in Denver by, no, that's not true, baby. Yeah, the dealership would've fixed my car for free, but that would've taken longer. I'm paying $200 out of my pocket. No, $220, out of my own pocket. Sylvia... [bangs table] Can I get the check? [clinking] - Attention everybody. Now I know it doesn't look bad here, but in the mountain passes, it's really coming down bad. And they say it's only gonna get worse. They told me I have to bring you guys back to Las Vegas. [groaning] I know, I'm sorry, but I have no choice. So let's eat up, let's drink up, let's make the memories, let's hit the road in about 15 minutes. - [Mrs. Barnes] Well, there it is. Guess we'll just have to make the best of it. - Excuse me, please. Hey, excuse me. Excuse me, I couldn't help but overhear your phone call. - Yeah, you and everybody else. No signal for two hours, and then right in the middle of a crowd of people, I-- - You're going to Denver, right? 'Cause I've gotta get to Denver. - Aren't you on the bus? - Yeah, but the bus is going back. Look, I heard you say that you're out $220, and I would give it to you if I had it, but all I've got is 180, and it's yours for the ride to Denver. - All you have is $180 dollars? - Yeah, I mean, that's all I've got on me, but I guess I could-- - No, that's not how I meant it. I meant that that must be very important to you. - It is. - Well, I can't take all your cash, but how about we split the gas? - Very cool, thank you so much. I'm Lisa. - I'm Brad. Why don't you grab your bags off the bus, and I'm gonna grab my car. - [Lisa] Okay, thanks! - You sure? You don't even know him. - He seems like a nice guy. That's it. - This it? - Yeah, the blue duffel, yeah. - [Driver] Okay, here we go. - Thank you so much. - There you go. - Thank you. - I hope you know what you're doing. God bless. - [Lisa] Thanks. - Have a nice time at the wedding. You'll make a beautiful bridesmaid. Drive safely. - Are you coming, ma'am? - Yes, yes. Would you help me get that license plate number? - Yes, I will. - 7452... - It's Q-E-S. It's Colorado plates. - Okay. [gentle music] - It's really her Mom. She wants us to make the big announcement at Christmas. - Christmas isn't for a week. - Yeah, but her big annual Christmas party's tomorrow. Oh, turn that up. - [Reporter] In Colorado and Utah. Except four to six hour flight delay to Denver International, adding strain to an already difficult picture for holiday travel. We'll be back in 10 minutes with more updates on this severe weather alert. [gentle guitar music] - Why don't they ever talk about the roads? - You love her? - Huh? - Sylvia. You love her and she loves you? - Yes. - Then don't worry about it. I'm sure the phone call was just for show. I'm sure her mom was like listening in on her end or something stupid. - Yeah, well you don't know Sylvia. [soft rock music on radio] [dramatic music] [skidding] [shouting] [crashes] [gasping] Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm okay. - [groans] I'm so sorry about this. Are you crying? - No, I'm fine, I just, I thought I was dead for a second there. - Nothing, why am I not surprised. Okay, I'm gonna unbuckle myself. I'm gonna try not to fall on you. Just be prepared okay? - No, I'm ready, I'm ready. Go ahead. [grunts] - Sorry. - [Lisa] It's okay, it's okay. - You sure you okay? - I'm okay, I'm okay. - You're pregnant. - Of course I'm pregnant, what did you just think I was fat? - No, I thought you had, your parka was... Nevermind, I'm just digging myself deeper and deeper. All right. They say you're supposed to stay in the car, but this is ridiculous. I saw a sign. So we haven't gone too far since then. Here. It's just in case we have to break in. [dramatic music] We made it. - We made it? Made it where? I don't see it. - Rosemont. I'm not exactly sure what it is, but it's something, and something is better than nothing. - Where do you think it is? - I'm guessing it's up that hill. Why don't we just, shh quiet! - I wasn't even-- - Shush! Snowmobiles. Yeah, yeah, yeah! - [Both] Help! Help! Help! - It's all right. It's not exactly our lucky night. - Let's just keep moving. I have a really bad feeling about this. - We don't have many options, unless you want to freeze to death. We just got in an accident, we need help. [gunshot bangs] - You should have thought of that before you went out joyriding and bothering people! - Here, you try and talk to her, I'm gonna-- - Son, drop it. - Get off of this property. And take your fat little friend with you. - I'm not fat, I'm pregnant. - She's telling the truth, we gotta let 'em in. - Don't you dare! Pregnant or not, any girl well enough to run around on a snowmobile is well enough to walk home. And I don't care how far that is! - We're not on snowmobiles, we just had a car crash. - Come on Josie, you know we gotta let 'em in. They're freezing out here. - You work for me, remember? Get rid of 'em. - Don't listen to anything she says, she's not gonna shoot. Come on, come on. - That's it. You're fired. - The next time that you fire me, I'm really gonna quit, finally get myself a decent job. You, come on in. Come on. For God's sake. [gasps] - Can I use your phone? My cell phone's been out of service. - Our phone line's been out for two days. It always goes out in these storms. - They can sleep in your room since they're your guests. You can set up a cot for yourself in the storeroom. - The sign says this is a lodge? - A lodge that's closed, shut down, locked up. You think I can afford to keep 100 rooms heated just in case some idiots come... [gasping] - Josie? - Am I bleeding somewhere or something? - No. - [Abe] Josie, are you all right? - I'm fine. Can't you see, she's not just pregnant? She's eight months pregnant, at least. And can't you see she's wet, shivering? Take them down to your room, I got in there today, at least the sheets are clean. And get my my nightgown, robe, and slippers, give them to her. They can strip off their wet clothes and the boy can bring them down to me here. - My name is Brad, and this is Lisa. - The boy can wear a towel until his clothes are dry, unless you want to lend him something. The girl should get right into bed. I'll have something hot in 15 minutes. Now, don't just stand there. Move! - Well, here we are. The place is clean, just like she said. Sometimes it takes me a week to find anything when she gets done straightening up in here. - We feel really bad about taking your bed. - Yeah, is she serious about a cot in the storeroom? - Oh, there's not much else on this end of the lodge anyway. I really don't mind sleeping on a cot, I've slept on worse. Bathroom is across the hall. Yeah. - [Both] What? - I almost forgot. [sighs] Want some? - No thanks. - I'm pregnant. - I'll leave you to it. - Wow. - Welcome to Bizarro World. So weird. - He works for her but she cleans up for him? What's up with that? - I mean, are they doing it? - Oh, ooh, trust me, not a chance. - So then what's their deal? - They're probably asking the same about us right now. - Not even, I bet you they're just taking for granted that-- - Yeah. I'm sorry about that. It's just I couldn't face them asking me, "Who's the father?" "Where's he at?" - Hey, I didn't think it was the time for explanations either. [chopping] [clears throat] - Just dump 'em on the floor, I'll be there in a minute. - And, here you are. And here you are. - Thanks. - Anything else you need? - No ma'am. - This is amazing. - It's just lamb stew. - It's incredible lamb stew though. - Then tell your wife to eat it. - Oh, she's not my wife, we're not even-- - No, I don't need the whole life story. [door creaks] [thudding] - Did you see that? She won't even look at me and he won't stop staring. It's so creepy, ugh. - Yeah. But this is great stew, you definitely gotta try it. - All right. - That was the best lamb stew I've ever had. - That was nothing. All she cooks these days is plain food. - Plain? That was incredible. - Don't get me wrong. It's great, but back when... [chuckles] You never even heard of the Rosemont Lodge, have you? - Nope, can't say that I have. - Well, it stands to reason, we've been closed for near to 18 years. You would have been how old? - I would've been seven. - I was 47. That was a long, long, long, long time ago. - So, you're saying the lodge-- - Oh, it was famous. We had presidents here. Well, none while they were in office, but we had Jimmy Carter's whole family after he was president, and the Clintons came when he was still Governor of Arkansas. - So it was a hunting lodge? - Hunting, fishing, horseback riding, ice-skating, sleigh riding in the winter time, golf, tennis in the summer. Did I mention the King of Spain? - No. - A fisherman. 3800 acres, with every outdoor activity that you could name. And do you know what the biggest attraction was? - Skiing and Snowboarding? - No. The food. Josie's cooking. She got written up in "Gourmet" magazine and such. That was the reason people came, that and the way that Josie made every night a party. [laughs] - No offense, but she seems like she's-- - I know, I know, nowadays you're looking at a bitter old battle-ax. [laughing] [thuds] - And that bitter old battle-ax is looking at a drunken old windbag, and a boy too stupid not to drive a pregnant girl out into a blizzard and dump her in a ditch. Did she eat? - Yes, and it was delicious. - I want the two of you out of here first thing in the morning. - That's what we want, too. - It's not gonna be that easy. There'll be snowdrifts up to 10 feet by morning in places. - We've plowed out our own road before. - Not in snow this deep, and you can't plow the highway. Last time it dumped snow like this, it took 'em eight days to get around to the 64. - Eight days? - You just want to keep 'em captive so you can talk their ears off. I want 'em out tomorrow. - No, it's okay, come on in. I'm still awake. As if I could sleep in this house with those two. - He's not too bad. She's crazy. - Really scary. - Yeah. It's funny, she cooks us a great meal, washes our clothes, and it's like she wants to strangle us the whole time. What is up with that? All right, look, I can sleep on the floor. - No, no, it's okay. There's plenty of room. At least they'll think we're boyfriend and girlfriend. - Never had a chance to say otherwise. All right. Ready for me to turn out the light. - Yeah, go for it. [gentle music] [both laughing] It's like the first night with a new roommate. - Yeah, or like the first night at band camp. [laughing] - Can you believe, this is still just the day I met you at the coffee shop while you were on the phone with Sylvia? - Sylvia, oh! God, she would go ballistic right now if she saw me. But yeah, it does not feel like the same day. - No way. All right. Well, good night. - Good night. [sighs] [both laughing] Stay on your side. [dramatic music] [gentle music] - [Abe] You're up awful early. - Yeah. - Can I buy you a cup of coffee? - [Brad] Sure, why not. - Black? - Yeah. - Came to see if there's anything I can do to help. - Well actually, there is. You feel like a little exercise before breakfast? - Wow. - Care for a little eye opener? - No thank you. This is sick. Do I get to drive it? - Do you know how? - I can learn. - Well, if you really want to work up an appetite before breakfast, take this flag down to the front gate. It's for snowplows, it let's 'em know to plow our road, and dear God, don't forget to take off the chain. - But what if they don't come for eight days? - They might come sooner, you never know. And it would a lot simpler if they'd plow us out, than us trying to dig our way out with this little guy. [dramatic music] [crows cawing] [door creaks] [thuds] - Abe? Girl? [knocking] Lisa? Lisa! Lisa. Where are they? - Well, I sent Brad down to the front gate with the snowplow flag. - Then where's the girl? Lisa! - Lisa! - Lisa! - Lisa! - Listen, you can go faster, go get her. - Lisa! Lisa! Lisa! Lisa! [breathing heavily] Lisa! - What's wrong? What are you doing? Where are you going? - Hey, let me go. - Look around you. Where are you going? There's nothing. What do you want, to kill yourself? - I don't know, maybe. - Just yesterday you were crying because you thought the car crash killed you. - I was relieved when I thought that the car crash killed me. I was crying because I'm still alive. - Kids, I'm old and I'm freezing. Can we please go back to the lodge now? - Come on. - Hey. [sobbing] - Come on. Come on. - Come on. - It's all right, it's okay. - Come on, it's okay. - Come on. [dramatic music] [gentle music] - There you go. [sighs] You rest. Everything will be all right. Now she has a fever. What in the world did you do to that girl? - Nothing. I only met her yesterday. - What? You're not her-- - No. She asked for a ride and I gave her one. - Oh, why didn't you tell me? - Because you never gave me a chance to. - You slept in the same bed? - It's not like I'm trying to fool around or anything. - Huh. How long to get that generator going? - Josephine, the generator has been running since the power lines were down. - I mean the big generator. - The big? Not long, half an hour. - Good. Once that's done, turn on the heat and the fireplace in room 133. We'll put her in there, he can have room 134. Abe, that rotgut you drink every day is ruining your brain. - Give me a hand. [dramatic music] - Wow! - Told you. - It's seriously gigantic. - I told you. Heat's coming on, and the place will look different with the fireplace fire going. [dramatic music] - Leave off doing that. The main thing is to get the tractor going. - Hey Brad? Feel like playing with the tractor? [fire crackling] - It's beautiful. - You just get into bed. - Thank you. I don't mean to put you through so much trouble. - No trouble, really. You just rest, try to get your strength back. - Why don't you ever look at me? - I'm looking at you, what are you talking about? - Nothing. - Abe told me what you said down there. Believe me, I understand wanting to be dead. But you can't think of just yourself. - I know, the baby. - Yes, and what about your parents? They'd be devastated. - They said they never wanted to hear my name again. - Okay. What about the baby's father? - Oh, he'd be devastated. - What do you mean? - They could order movies, pay-per-view, play video games, music, they can even surf the Internet, all from their remote. I mean, every good hotel has a system like that these days. - Sounds expensive. - That's the thing. These companies, they'll provide you the hardware and the software for free, and then they split the fees with you. In-room entertainment was the fourth biggest moneymaker at the Little Nell in Aspen last year. - You stay in a lot of nice hotels. - I work in a lot of nice hotels. I'm a snowboarder with no sponsor, meaning I'm a waiter. In the winter, these places are always looking for people, so I get to go to all the snowboarding events, and then I pick up work a week here, a week there, and that's what this place needs. - Waiters? - Snowboarding. You could design a really cool border cross-terrain, put in a half pipe, oh, it'd be awesome. - So you were 15 and he was how old? - 35? - There is a type of man who can very easily manipulate young women. - But it didn't feel like I was being manipulated. It was what I wanted, I was in love with him. And I went after him more than he went after me, and I know that makes me sound like such. - [chuckles] That does not make you sound like. - It did to my parents. They're very active in the church, and they kept saying I shamed them. So that's when they shipped off to boarding school, and Craig moved away. We didn't see each other for four years, and then when we got back together, it was like nothing had ever changed. And then of course, I got pregnant, and he said he still loved me. - Whose idea was it to put the baby up for adoption? - It was both of ours, I guess. Craig kept saying we could always start a family after I finished college. - You know how that sounds, don't you? - Like he was manipulating me. But it seemed like it made sense, though. He started talking about a couple that could give advantages to the baby that we couldn't. And that part was true, at least. And that's how all of this ended up coming out. - What, what came out? [beeping] - All right. Start it up. - All right. [engine rumbling] - And, when you're ready, like I told you, easy. - So, of course, Craig did all the talking with the couple. Apparently the lady wanted to talk to me, but he kept coming up with excuses, like I was out or sleeping or something. So one day he left his cell phone at home, and I answered it and it was them, and they were extremely nice. - What tipped you off? - Okay, so the wife starts telling me about how they'd give such a good home to the baby. And the husband says, "Yeah, that $75,000 "is just a token of what we'd be willing "to spend on the baby." And I go, "What $75,000?" And he says, "The 75K for you and your husband." - You must have been shocked. - Oh, so were they. I mean, first of all they thought we were married. And secondly, they couldn't believe I didn't know anything about the money. - What did Craig say about this? - I didn't want to wait around to find out. But I swear, until yesterday, I really thought he loved me. - Wait, this happened yesterday? - Feels like it was a week ago, but yeah. Yesterday. I don't know what I'm gonna do. I've got a girlfriend in Denver, but she lives with her parents, so I'm not sure how long they'd be cool with having a pregnant chick staying at their house. - Now is not the time to worry. The advantage of being snowed in is that there's nothing you can do about it, so you might as well take it easy. When is your due date? - They said some time around Christmas. - Don't worry, first babies tend to be late. Mine, mine hung on for two solid weeks. - Let's hope. - Yeah. [chuckles] [dramatic music] [knocking] - Yes, can I help you? - Hi, ma'am. I got your name from the bus company. I was wondering, have you seen this girl? She could be in a lot of trouble and I need to find her. - I thought so. You know, when I saw her, I said to myself, self I said, "That girl's in trouble." I wrote down the license plate. Wait here just a minute. - I used to have one of these when I was little. Now it just looks like a piece of history. - Great. Now I have to get a new one. I can't imagine how much that would cost. Under a thousand bucks, and it would be a million times faster than this one. - Under a thousand dollars? You're kidding. We paid three times that for this one. - Is this Josephine? - Yes. - And that's you? - Yeah. - Who are they? - Oh, now that's a long story. You sure you want to hear it? - Hey, I gotta show you this. - Okay, me first. Come here. - What? - Put your hand here. - Okay. Okay? - All right, now you have to be patient. What were you going to show me? - First, I know why this place is shut down, and why Josephine is-- - So strange and weird? - Yeah. Turns out she was married with a daughter who was like my age, and the daughter is married with a baby girl. - Okay, I'm with you. - And, oh! - You felt that, right? - Yeah, I did. Was that him kicking? - Yeah. How do you know this is a boy? - Because with a kick like that, it's definitely a dude. - You think girls can't kick now? - No, but still, I got 10 on it says it's a boy. - Okay, so back to your story. There's the daughter, the son-in-law, and the baby granddaughter. - Yeah. The son-in-law is a pilot, has his own Cessna. They were on their way flying back here when they got caught in a bad storm. - Sounds familiar. - Very familiar. They crashed, too. - Oh my god, were they okay? - The thing was is, nobody knew where it went down. They had searches all over Colorado and Utah, but they only found the plane a week later in a National Forest. Normally there's a lot of tourists there, but because of the storm, no one saw where the plane went down. - They were dead? - Yeah. And the worst thing was that animals had made it. They were just tough to identify. And the baby never got found at all. They just figured it got dragged away. - Oh, that's awful. - Yeah. So she shut down the lodge. - No wonder. - Then, that same year, her husband was killed in a hunting accident. - Oh, I wish I never said she was strange. - Me either. And I haven't even showed you the freaky thing. - There's something more freaky? I'm not sure I want to know. - Okay, so there's Josephine. - Yeah. - That's her husband, Kyle. - Mm-hmm. - That's the son-in-law holding the granddaughter. And that's the-- - The daughter. - Isn't it amazing? She looks exactly like you. - Well, I mean, kind of. Not exactly. - Are you kidding me, it freaked me out when I saw it. - Oh, let me have your hand. - Wow, what was that? - I don't know. I think the baby is shifting around or something. Oh! - Wow, that was a kick. You're definitely having a guy. How does that feel? That's gotta hurt. - It's just kind of weird. I don't know, it's... [gasping] - What's the matter? - Go get Josephine, hurry up. Hurry up. [suspenseful music] - Hey, where's Josephine? - Probably in the kitchen. - Kitchen? - I made a mess. - Out. - I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. - It's all right. It's perfectly normal. We'll just get the sheets changed. Okay, thank you, thank you. [chuckles] - Where did that come from? - I heard what happened. I'm so sorry. - That old drunk never learned to keep his mouth shut. Don't worry about it. It was a long time ago. - They're a hundred years old. - [Brad] They look strong, though. They're not falling apart. - Her water broke. - She's gonna have the baby? - I had 22 hours between my water breaking and the baby coming. I'm just gonna move into room 135 and leave the connecting door open in case she needs me in the night. - I'm gonna go for help first thing in the morning. - That's more than 20 miles. - I told him that. - There could be a complete white out. You've seen what the weather is like. You'd lose all sense of direction, you could die out there. - And I told him that, too. - I'm not gonna die out there, all right? I'm gonna be okay. Do you have energy bars? - Energy bars? - Yeah, you know, like something to eat? - I could pack some roast chicken and sandwiches. Just like energy bars, only made with food. - That'll work. [dramatic music] [Abe grunting] - [Abe] All right. - Wish me luck. - Good luck. - No, don't hold your breath. Breathe in, really deeply. [breathing heavily] In... [groaning] In, in, in, breathe in. Now, let it out slow, good. In, all the way. [slowly exhales] Good. It's good, good. [groaning] Okay. Okay. Breathe, deep, in, out. Don't push. - Don't push? - [Josephine] No, it's not time yet. - Oh, God. - [breathing heavily] Okay, I gotta move. - No, it's not time for you to go flat on your back yet. - I need to get up. - No, you don't. - I have to go to the bathroom. - It feels like you have to go, but that's just the pressure from the baby. Okay, [clears throat] I'm gonna check you. [dramatic music] Good, now do fast breathing. [panting] - Okay, if possible, place a folded towel or blanket under her leg to keep her from laying completely flat. - I want you to take a very deep breath and we're gonna push to the count of 10. Okay, push. [groaning] Nine, 10, okay. Relax. We'll push again when you're ready. - You do this part. - What does it say? - You read it. - I don't have my reading glasses on. - Well, where are they? - Abe, this is not time to get squeamish. [groaning] - That's good, breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe. - I can see the baby's head. It's not gonna be long now. [shouting] Push really hard now. - I can't. - Yes you can, push. Come on, push, push. - Okay, push, one more. Oh not, stop. Stop pushing. The whole baby's head is completely out. Abe, grab that turkey baster, use the tongs. Hold still, hold still now. I have to clean the baby's nose and mouth. Okay, what's next? - If the umbilical cord is wrapped around the infant's neck-- - No, it's not. Skip that part. - Okay. Place your hands on either side of the baby's head and gently guide it downwards while the mother pushes, until the top shoulder emerges. - Looks like the worst part's over. You ready to push again? Okay, come on. [shouting] [baby crying] Okay, I got the shoulders. [laughing] Oh, no. Here he comes. I got him. - Once delivered, hold the baby's face down and head down-- - I know this part. Okay. - All right. - [Josephine] Here he is. Just be careful, don't pull the cord. - Hi. Hi. Hello. - You got any cell phone service? - No, but get in, I'll give you a lift to town. - Ah, thank you. - Lisa, honey, we're gonna cut the umbilical cord. You can keep the baby right where he is. - Okay. - I'm just gonna grab the cord. Can you help me move it over here? Oh, come on, it's a placenta, not a rattlesnake. Okay. Ready? Come on. [sighs] Good work. Abe, Abe? - [Abe] Sorry, what? - Have you been drinking that rotgut of yours? - No, of course not. - Well, now might be a good time. [engines roaring faintly] - Snowmobiles. - I am gonna teach those little, to leave us alone. - No, no, no, no, no. They're coming to the front door. - What? Oh, well go, go. Lisa, you okay? - Yeah, I'll be fine. [engines roaring] - Doc, I am so glad you're here! Nice going, kid. Come on, come on. - Josephine. - If I'd known you were this close, I wouldn't have cut the cord. - Whoa. - The baby's born? - Yes! Lisa says to tell you, you won your bet. - Yes! [grunts] That means it's a boy. - Ah. - Would you take them into the kitchen, and we will go look in on the baby. - Hot chocolate? - Follow. - You rest now, hmm? Hey, psst. You did a nice job. - She lost a lot of blood. - She'll be fine. There's still some residual bleeding. I'm going to massage her uterus. That should take care of it. - Was that Agnes Donahue's boy, little Michael? - Little Michael's a Captain in the Marine Corp. That was Ethan, his brother. He wasn't even born when-- - When I became a crazy old recluse. - Your words, not mine. Long time no see. The place looks wonderful, everybody misses it, you know. - Who's the other boy? - You'll get a kick out of this. Richard Francis Garcia. - Velma and Hank got married? - Four kids now. - Well, what do you know? I'll be downstairs if you need me. - So is snowboarding harder or easier than skiing? - Easier. Do you think I can go see the baby now? - Sure, go on upstairs, just wait for the doctor to get finished with her. - Okay, thanks. - You look exhausted. Why don't you go lie down? - Sure thing. Boys. - Do you think I'm blind? You think I wouldn't recognize those snowmobiles harassing me the last two years? You do realize I could have shot you. What's so funny? - You had your shotgun filled with rock salt. - How'd you know that? - The sound it made. - And suppose I got sick of you two and loaded in real shells? - Well, you never really aimed at us anyway. [chuckles] - I'll aim this at you. Right now. Unless you want me to talk to your parents. And don't think I don't know who you are, Mr. Ethan Donahue. I know your mom, your dad, your grandparents on both sides. Well, you want me to talk to them? - No ma'am. - Maybe you want me to talk to Michael. He used to come here when he was little. You think he'd like the idea of his little brother bothering the old lady that used to give him cookies? Or, do you want to take this, like a man? - I'll take that. - Then, get up, lean over this table. Mm-hmm. - Dude! - Shut up. - [chuckles] Yeah, you think you're getting off scot free, don't you, Richard Francis Garcia? - Hi. Is it okay? - Yeah, you're good. - Okay. [smacking bottoms] - Hmm? [grunting] Huh? [groans] [squeals] - Hi. - Brad, come on, come in. Look. - Wow! He's so big. - Isn't he beautiful? - It was wonderful to see you again. You and Abe could put me out of business. - Thank you, Richard, I hope never to do it again. And thank you for bringing the doctor here. That was a nice thing to do. - You're welcome, Mrs. Sutton. - My best regards to your parents. [laughing] [coughing] You all right? - I'm fine. [gentle music] - Abe? [gentle waltz music] - Oh. [clapping] - Don't be sneaking up on me like-- - Come on, don't be mad at me, I've missed hearing you play. That was beautiful. [clears throat] - Help yourself to a glass of wine. Fill me up, too. [upbeat jazzy piano music] - Yeah! - Whoop. [clears throat] We did it. Although I did think you were gonna lose your lunch for a second there. [laughing] - So did I. - You should've seen yourself in those yellow rubber gloves. - And I'm not gonna forget about that turkey baster. - I am never gonna be able to baste another turkey again. [laughing] - It does my heart good to hear you laugh. There used to be so much laughter in this room. - Yes there was, a long time ago. - Do you remember when we had half the folks of Cedar Breaks up here hoping to get a glimpse of Sydney Poitier? [laughs] - I do. Martha Draper drove 25 miles to borrow a cup of sugar. [laughing] - You remember when Kyle had that bet with the King of Spain? [piano lid bangs] - I wish you wouldn't mention him. - The King of Spain? - Not funny. - Kyle was my best friend, and I think about him every day. - I try very hard not to. - Why? He loved you. - Then why did he leave me? If he loved me so much, then why would he leave me? [dramatic music] [sobbing] - So, why'd he leave her? - You heard that? - I think all of Southern Utah heard her. Who's she talking about? - Her husband, Kyle. - He left her? You said he was killed in a hunting accident. - A solo hunting accident. Think about it. - He killed himself? - I never known the term solo hunting accident to mean anything different. Would you like some wine? [exhales sharply] - You guys decided to celebrate. - No. [chuckles] That's just the everyday wine we used to serve. - This is an everyday wine? - We have some really good wines in the cellar. - Can I look? - Well, Josephine doesn't trust me with the key for some reason. - I can just take a peek. - This, all this, this is what we were drinking, right? We used to go through a lot of this in this weather, so many cases of the same thing. - How much did you charge for that? - 35, 40, under 50. - You used to sell a Heitz Martha's Vineyard 1993 for under 50 bucks? - Remember, it wasn't as old back then. - All these wines are pre-98? - Yeah, some of them are older than that. - Remember that restaurant I used to work at in Aspen? We had a Heitz Martha's Vineyard Cab on our list that we used to sell for $350, and that was an '09. - You're kidding. - Is that a Double-Magnum Petrus? - Yeah, is that good? - Yeah, is it a 1990? I mean, that's gotta be 10 or 15 grand for that bottle. - Really? - Mm-hmm. - You keep on looking, I'm gonna get a pencil and paper. - [Josephine] We'll miss you. - [Lisa] Thank you guys. - [Brad] I'm outta here. - [Abe] Say, buddy. [gentle music] [sighs] [sighs] - Abe, where's the car keys? [gasps] Will you close your mouth? You look like an idiot. - What do you need the keys for? - Lisa forgot her purse. Get the keys. - You're not thinking of driving? You haven't driven a car in 15 years. - You haven't been sober in 15 years. - I haven't had a drink this morning, thank you very much. - Just give me the keys. - Are you gonna be difficult about this? [baby cries] - You forgot this. - Oh, thank you. - Oh, you look a lot better. - [chuckles] Thanks. So do you. I didn't mean that the way it sounded. I just meant you look really nice. - Thank you. And so does little no-name. You haven't named him. - No, not yet. I never thought I would be the one to name him. - Think handsome, he's a handsome boy, needs a handsome name. - Did Brad leave town? - I'm sure he wouldn't without saying goodbye. Um, you haven't called your parents. The nurse told me that too. - You know what the situation is, I just-- - But I bet it's changed now the baby's here. - I doubt it. - Well, I don't doubt it a bit. And they should be informed. Look, I will call them, if you like. - If you want to, sure, I just, I really don't think it'll do any good. [engine rumbling] - Yeah, they say there's nothing wrong with it mechanically. No, we got lucky. Thanks, Dad, I just feel terrible about it. Hey, can I call you back? Love you too, bye. - Nice truck, yours? - Yeah. - Yeah. Up against the vehicle! Let's go, move! - What? - Spread your arms and legs, man. - What is going on? Sylvia, you're not listening. I didn't abduct anybody. I'm not calling with another excuse. I'm calling because I'm, Sylvia... I need to make another phone call. - One phone call means one phone call. - Well, can someone please call Josephine Sutton? - [Officer] There's a blast from the past. Don't think anybody's talked to her in 20 years. - But you can call her, though? - [Lisa] I didn't want to, that's why I left you that note. - [Craig] But you didn't give me a chance to explain. - Selling my baby isn't something you can just explain, Craig. - [Craig] Okay, it's our baby, and the money was for us. I just, I wanted it to be a surprise. - It sure was a surprise. - [Craig] How could you think that I could do anything to harm you or the baby? This is for the baby. - How? The money isn't going to the baby. - [Craig] It just proves how much they're going to love him. It's for a new life, for you to go to college, right? You can finally quit Wal-Mart. You can go to school full time. We can get you that car you've always wanted. - Craig, there's something I have to ask you, and be honest with me. - [Craig] Baby, I'm always honest with you. - Please, Craig. In the beginning, did you really love me? - What? Of course, I loved you then as much as I love you now. - You don't love me now. - Baby, I do love you, you know that. - I wish you knew how much I wanted to believe you. - Honey, every word I'm telling you right now is the truth. - I just can't anymore, I can't do this. [clears throat] - Do you know what? Just believe what you want then, but I am serious about the money. We'll split it halfway, 37.5 a piece. - I'm not giving up my baby. - No, it's our baby. We both decide. What are you gonna do? Are you gonna keep it? You gonna work at Wal-Mart while you bring him up? - If I have to, yeah. - You're thinking emotionally. You're not thinking about what is best for him, and you're not thinking about what is best for you. - Hey, keep your voice down. He's sleeping, okay? [exhales sharply] - Okay look, what if, what if I get them to come up to 100 grand, okay, we get 50 a piece? - You better go now. - Look, I'm not going to-- - Hey, let go, I have an IV in my arm! [thudding] - Take your hands off her. - [Craig] Whoa, what are you, lady... - All right, I want to see her in two weeks. Hey, hey! Josephine! - Don't mind me. - Call 911. [thuds] [grunts] Hey, hey, hey, stop that. [groans] - Do you want some more? [siren whoops] - Settle, easy, easy, come on. Hey hey hey, easy, come on. - That's enough, step back. What's going on here? - There's a mother and baby in there, and this man was bothering them. - I am the father. Okay, I have rights. - Let's see. You molested the girl when she was 15, and now you try to sell her baby? What part of that's gonna sound good to a judge? - Excuse me, ma'am, who are you? - This is Josephine Sutton, Officer. - You're Josephine Sutton? - Why? - Your phone lines are down, we just sent a car out to the lodge to ask about the man who abducted that woman. The one with the baby, him? - Oh, he didn't abduct anyone. The girl's right inside, you can ask her yourself. - Hey, you can't keep-- - Hey, settle-- - You can't keep me from my baby. - Is Lonny still Sheriff? - Yes, ma'am. - You tell Lonny that I'm going to call him in 10 minutes and I want to hear that this boy has been released. Are you still here? - You think you can get rid of me that easily? - Yes. Yes I do. - Wait a minute, she assaulted-- - Mrs. Sutton, if he gives you anymore trouble, let us know. - Okay, ready? - Okay. [camera clicks] [baby cries] - Oh. - Here you are. Here, let's get one of all of us. - Hop in. - Hi, shh, shh, shh, shh. - All right, ready? - All right, yeah. - Ready? [camera clicks] [baby cries] - Oh, okay, okay. Okay, we'll put you back. - [Lisa] Oh yeah. - Hi. - Hi. Yeah. - [Brad] Oh, shh, shh, shh. - [Lisa] Oh, yeah. - Let me see. Oh, that's a good one. - Yeah. - Mind if I make a print for Josephine? I don't think she has email. - Yeah, she'd like that. She'd like that. - Hi. So you're gonna be staying there when you get outta here? - Yeah, she said I can stay until New Year's. I don't want to wear out my welcome, though. - No you don't. She is something. They told me threw that guy out on the streets that was harassing you. - Yeah, scared him away. [chuckles] Hey, think about how much she used to scare us. - Yeah, no kidding. He is gonna be huge. - I know. - He's gonna be huge. Promise me you'll get him a snowboard when he's four or five. - I promise. [baby crying] Shh, it's okay. So the car's all packed? - Yeah, yeah, all packed. - No snowstorm warnings or anything crazy, right? - No, I'm all clear. [chuckling] I hate saying goodbye. - Yeah, I know, but she's waiting. - Right. Yeah, I better get going. Better get going. All right. [chuckles] What's the etiquette for a new mom? Do I kiss you on the lips, do I kiss you on the cheek? - I mean, we did sleep together, but still. - Well, I'm gonna get going, I guess. - Have a nice trip. - Yeah, I will. Okay, okay, I'm gonna get going. Take care of that big guy. - I will. - It's just that the building codes have changed, and we need new exit signs on all the doors leading to the outside. - Even if we're not open to the public? - Well no, but we should keep the place up to code. Just in case you change your mind. - This satellite dish for the internet, that's part of the building code? - No, it's not part of the code, but it isn't just internet access either. All the TV comes through the same dish, and then we put up a wireless system so that the guests can go around anywhere with their iPads and their email or whatever. - What guests? Just supposing that I lost my mind entirely and wanted to reopen this place, where in the world would I get all the money to do all of this? - You're standing on it. - I am not gonna mortgage this place, Abe, never. - I meant the wine cellar downstairs. Think about it. All that wine down there is from before 1995. Do you have any idea how much it's worth today? - No. Do you? - No. Not until Brad told me. Do you know that bottle of wine that we had the other night? That cost $350 today. Do you remember how much you paid for it? - Around $220. - That's $220 a case. - Isn't that what I just said? - This is $350 a bottle. Brad said that we could auction off half that wine down there, restock the cellar, and still have $150,000 to put in your pocket. And that's after paying for the exit signs, the whole internet thing, flat screen TVs, and the new phone system. - Abe, listen to me. You put this idea right out of your mind. And, you know, it's time to move the ladder. - Anything you say, Josephine. Anything you say. - He didn't really open his eyes much, but look at him. Doesn't he look so cool? - Yeah, he's cute. You said you came straight here. - I did. - Well, you had time for quite the photo shoot. - I didn't want you thinking I was making this up. - Clearly you weren't making it up. All you talked about at dinner was Lisa, Lisa, Lisa. - I didn't talk at all at dinner. - Now you were showing me pictures of a stranger's baby, and you're acting like it's your own kid. - She's not some stranger. I got to know her-- - Real well, apparently. - What's wrong with you? - You like her better than me, don't you? [contemplative music] You do. You love her. - I never meant to-- - Just get out. Go! - I still don't understand how you can say that. He is your grandson. [sighs] Well, how did that happen? She was how old? You have no knowledge of who left her there, or why? No, yeah, I'm still here. I do understand that you have strong religious beliefs. I am curious though, which religion is it that you... Really? Well, yes I am surprised, because the whole time that we were talking, you said nothing Christian at all, [clears throat] so naturally I... Goodbye, and Merry Christmas to you too. - I see the phone's working again. - Yeah. - Are you all right? - I'm fine. I'm fine. [gentle music] - Here we go. One healthy little boy, thanks to you and Josephine. I'm telling you, you guys were great. - All right, and here we are. Yeah, look at... [gentle music] It's beautiful. Josephine, thank you. Let's go to our room, yeah. - That's lovely. [clears throat] - Are you going to Benjamin's for Christmas dinner? - No, Ben's in Florida with his wife's folks this year. - Would you like to have Christmas dinner here? - Why, uh, thank you, Josie, it would be a pleasure. ["The First Noel"] - [Josephine] Did you know she was adopted? - [Richard] Lisa? No. - She was, when she was one year old. She's 19 now. Lisa is exactly the age that Linda would be today. Oh, I see. - [chuckles] Just stay, just right here, just for a second. I have to show you something. - [Richard] Sure. - Does anyone in this picture remind you of anyone? - Well, I already notice Lisa looks a lot like your daughter. - She does. But who else, who else, who else? Come on, look at her. My granddaughter. - Oh, if you say so. It's hard to compare a one-year-old with a grown woman. - She's 19. - Your granddaughter or Lisa? - Both. - I see. They would have been the same age, so Lisa reminds you of your granddaughter? - No offense, Richard, but how did you get through medical school? I'm not saying she reminds me of her. I'm telling you, Lisa is my granddaughter. - Oh. - Do not look at me like I'm crazy. Look at the facts. The plane crashed. Pam and Charlie were found with the plane, but there was no trace of Linda. - They said that the animals could have carried her-- - Animals, shmanimals, listen to me. Two months later, an unknown couple dropped off a baby girl of one year old. Baby girl, at the Salt Lake City Emergency Room. Salt Lake City is less than 200 miles from the crash site. - You're suggesting that somebody found Linda way out in the woods? - Well, it's a National Park. There are campgrounds all over the place. - And took the girl without telling anyone? - Maybe they wanted a kid. Maybe they didn't want to deal with the law. - And dropped her at an emergency room two months later? - Is that so unbelievable? I'll tell you what's unbelievable. A one year old baby girl goes missing in a public park. Two months later, an identical looking baby girl shows up in the emergency room only 200 miles away. Now, you're telling me it's more likely those are two different baby girls? - But you're suggesting that 18 years later, the very same girl gets caught in a snowstorm and winds up here. What are the chances of that? - What are the chances of winning the lotto? Slim to nothing, right? But, what are you gonna do, say to somebody that just won the lotto that they didn't really, because look at all those odds. - Is that how you feel, like you've won the lottery? - Yes, I do. I think some force, I don't care whether it's chance or fate or God, something brought her home, just like it kept me here. - Well, she sure as heck needs a grandmother like you. And maybe you could use a granddaughter like her. - It's not just that, Richard. She really is my granddaughter. - There's one way to be sure. All I need is a swab of her saliva and a swab of yours. [chuckles] - I don't need that. I know what's in my heart. - That's maybe for the best. [chuckles] - You go right ahead and believe whatever it is you believe. I am gonna go right ahead and believe what I know is the truth. - See, it's a Christmas tree. All the pretty ornaments. You're just sleepy, there's nothing you can do about it. - Go on, it's never too early to talk to the baby. - I can't believe this is the same room. Kinda looked like a haunted mansion before. - It did, didn't it? - [Lisa] Yeah. - Do you mind if I asked you a personal question? - No, not at all. - [clears throat] Did you know that you were adopted? - Yeah, my parents remind me every chance they get. - What do you know about your real parents? - Nothing. They abandoned me when I was 12 months old. - They didn't abandon you. - They dropped me at the emergency room and vanished. What do you call that? - All those years you growing up believing yourself unloved, when the truth is, you were the most loved little girl in the world. - What do you mean? - You can see it, can't you? How much your mom and dad loved you. - You really think this is me? That I'm really Linda? - I think you are really Lisa, but when you were little, and you lived here, your name was Linda, yes. - I... Is this even possible? - Not if you don't believe it's possible. But, whether you believe or don't believe, I want you to know that this is your home, to stay here as long as you like. - Thank you, thank you so much. [vacuum whirring] - Josephine, do not sneak up on me like that. Aww. - Hey, buddy. [Brad grunts] [knocking on door] - [Abe] Lisa? - Yeah, come in. - We have a little surprise for ya. - Yeah, look what the cat dragged in. - Hi. - Hi. - What are you doing here? - Mind if I borrow the baby for a few minutes? - [Lisa] Mm. - Sound like a yes to you? - Sounded like a yes. - Yeah. That was a yes. ["O Holy Night"] - [Abe] You look so serious. - He's fine. [laughing] Come on, sit. - All right. - You too, Brad. - Yeah. - Everybody's ears are red. What were you two doing so long out in the cold? - We took a long walk, halfway around the property, didn't we? - They found the perfect spot for a half pipe and a tabletop. - You could build a full-on terrain park here without even changing the natural landscape. - I'm lost. Terrain park? - It's for snowboarders. It's a place for them to do tricks and so on. - And why would we want that? - I know exactly what you mean. You're thinking, hey, this is a high-end place, what do we want to do with a bunch of snowboarder bums like me? Well, the only snowboarder bums that are gonna be here are gonna be the instructors. - Then who exactly would they be instructing? - The kids. - The thing is, that snow-boarding has gotten to be more and more of a family sport. I mean, even moms and dads are out there now. Kids of all ages are doing it, and even the kids that aren't doing it, want to learn. So, I'm thinking with the right design, some hard stuff, some easy stuff, the kids are never gonna get tired of it. I mean, you're gonna be turning away customers. - We are turning customers away quite nicely now. Thanks very much. - That's because you're not open. - Exactly. I'm going to make some more gravy. - What'd I say? - Nothing. - It's okay. - That kid's the one who has been filling your head up with all this about voicemail, and satellite dishes, and half-pipes, and I want it to stop. Do you understand me? - I'm the one who has been asking the questions. Someone has to make plans, and you're not doing it. - Well, there's a good reason for that. I have no intention of re-opening the lodge, not now, not ever. - I have put up with you for 20 years, but now I'm gonna tell you the truth, the truth about Kyle. - I don't want to talk about Kyle. - Oh, well I do. You have always felt that by killing himself, he abandoned you. - He did! - Well, what about you? You shut down this lodge, you shut yourself off from him and everybody else. That's not killing yourself? I don't blame either one of you after a loss like that, but the plain truth is, you abandoned him as much as he abandoned you. He committed suicide in his way and you did it in yours. - You have no right! - Oh, oh, oh, well then who does? Nobody. You've cut yourself off from everybody else. I know that you love Lisa, and the baby. So what are they supposed to be? The next generation of crazy hermits living way out here? [crying] [moaning] Aww, Josephine. [groaning] [sobbing] It's okay. - Maybe we should cover up these plates and keep them from getting cold. - Yeah, let's put 'em in the oven. - I wouldn't do that just yet. - I could maybe check on her. - No. Just, it's okay. [suspenseful music] - Here she comes. - How come no one's eating? Richard, would you pass the gravy around? Thank you. [uplifting music] - Who wants gravy? - Yes. - Would anybody like some more roast beef? - Some of these carrots would be healthy here, too. [Josephine sighs] - So... - So what, Grandma? - What is a half-pipe? [laughing] ["Hark the Herald Angels Sing"] [peaceful music] [logo chiming]
