The kidnappers said that they would, um, they would contact me via email, and they ha... No, I don't want you to come down here. I need you to stay there. I have a very good support system, Olivia is here, and, luiz, and Gustavo, and it's... I just need you to stay there, and... And hopefully this will be just, ver... Taken care of quickly. I have to, uh, go, because the police are here, and I need... I absolutely will, mom. I... I love you, and I will... I will contact you, okay? - Senora, I need you to sign this. - All right. What is this? - It authorizes us to investigate and negotiate on your behalf. - Okay, you've um, you've handled kidnappings before, yes? - Yes. Quite a few. - And you've always gotten hostages back. - Every time. - Good. Did you I.D. The cars, the vehicles? - As I said before, senora, they were probably stolen. - Okay, how can you know that they're stolen if you haven't I.D.'Ed them, and- and have you blocked the roads to Santa Natalia? - I assure you, senora, we are doing everything that we can. - [Stuttering] Excuse me for one minute. [Speaks Spanish] - All the gates are locked. The media's gathering. - I don't want to talk to the media, 'cause they're just gonna turn this into a circus. Look, the local police, they, uh, they want to handle the negotiations. - Are they qualified? - I've never heard of anyone being kidnapped in or around Santa Natalia. - Neither have I, and I gotta be honest, I don't know if I trust them. - Aren't there people who do this? Specialists? - Yes, absolutely. Eduardo had a friend, Jorge, who had a business partner kidnapped a few years ago, and they had a private firm bring him back. - Do you know how to reach 'em? - No, but Eduardo will know how. In his, uh... in his contact list, I'm sure I'll find it. Okay? [Whispering] I'm gonna go find that, I'll be right back, okay? - Okay. [Phone rings] - Hello? - Yes, this is senorseptien. - Hi, this is jayne valseca, I'm from Santa Natalia. I got your name from, uh, Jorge ramos. - I see. How can I help you? - My... My husband was... Was kidnapped this morning. Uh, about three hours ago. - [On phone] I'm very sorry to hear that. - I need to retain someone to help negotiate his release. - Of course, did senor ramos advise you of our fee schedule? - Yes, um, 2,500 a day, plus expenses. - Valseca. Publishing valsecas? - Yes, that's... That's right. - Which is why they targeted you, no doubt. - But that's crazy, because we're not rich. - Oh. Uh, have the kidnappers made their demand? - Not yet. I'm... I'm still waiting for an email from them. - Please, tell me what happened. - Um, well, there were four men in three vehicles. We had just dropped our children off at school. - Excuse me, you were with your husband when he was kidnapped? - Yes. - But the kidnappers didn't harm you. - No. - How do you know they will email you? - Uh, they left a note for me before they drove... Drove off with him. - Did they leave anything else? - Uh, no, I don't... Uh, yes. [Stutters] There was a... a... A hammer in the front seat. A new one, uh, the price tag was still on it. - I'm afraid we can't help you. - Uh, I'm sorry, are... are you not available? - I recommend you contact afi. - Afi. The federal police. I... why can't you handle this? - Afi will explain it to you. - [Sighs] But... - You know anyone in Mexico City? - My husband's... My husband has family there. - Have one of them go down to afi headquarters, fill out the proper paperwork. - To fill out forms? Okay, but... - It's almost noon. I suggest that you act quickly. Best of luck. [Phone beeps] - [Sighs] - Uh, he wasn't interested, I guess. - Why not? - I don't know. - What was he saying about afi? - That we should have them secure Eduardo's release. - Federales? - Wha... - Someone in Mexico City has got to go to their offices and [laughing] fill out forms. - Carlos is probably home, let me call him. - Okay. - Is that the kidnappers, did they contact you? - No, Olivia, they're going to send an email. - Oh. Yeah, right [phone rings] - Um, I'll get it. Hello? - Carlos, hi. It's your sister. Something bad has happened to uncle Eduardo. We need your help. Talk to jayne, she'll explain. - [Weeps] Jayne. [Cries] - Eduardo never registered these guns that he inherited from his father. The federal police are coming... - Senora, we can store them in one of the upstairs closets. - Okay. Gustavo, what do you know about kidnappings? - Not a whole lot, really, uh, just what I read in the newspapers or I've seen on TV. But from the ones I've read about, they usually demand a few hundred thousand dollars. - Well, we should be able to manage that. - That is awful, jayne. I'm calling up your accounts now. - [On phone] Between the checking account and the cd, we should have about 500,000, right? - [On phone] Yeah, a little more than that. Just under 550, almost all of it in the cd. - Good. That's good. - But you don't have access to it. - What do you mean? - The account is in Eduardo's name. You're not a signatory. - But I... I've... I write checks on it all the time. - On your checking account, which Eduardo funds every month from savings and income. - So I... I'm sorry, what are you saying? Are you saying that I don't have access to my own money? - Legally it's not yours, it's Eduardo's. - But we're married, and if I can't get access to that money... - I understand. Let me see what I can work out. In the meantime, is there anything I can do now? - No. Thank you. - Afi called. An agent is on his way from Mexico City. - Oh, okay. That's good. - He'll be here tonight. - Great. Carlos wants to know if there is anything else he can do. - Uh... - Mama too. - I don't think so. You know, not until we know what we're dealing with here. - Mama said she'd contact Eduardo's brothers and sisters and let them know what happened. - Yeah, that would be helpful. Maybe she could act as the point person. You know, to... For the extended family. - I'm sure she'd be happy to. It's almost 2:30, and school will be out soon. - Yeah, I know. - Why don't I pick them up? - No, no, no. I, uh, I always pick them up. I want... Them to have the same routine, things to be normal, especially now. [Sighs] - Listen, um, if things get crazy around here, the kids can come and stay with us. - I appreciate that, Olivia, just... I, uh, I want to have them close right now, I think. - When is he coming back? - Soon, honey, soon. - I hate it when daddy goes away on business. - I do too, honey. Why don't you go get your soccer clothes on, Maria, okay? - Okay. - All right. - Why are the TV trucks outside the gate? - Sit. Come sit down. Sweetheart, please, sit down, love. Sit down, honey. - Something happened to dad, didn't it? You weren't at school today, and teachers were whispering. - Honey, um, your dad, he, uh, he was kid... He was kidnapped this morning. - Is he dead? - No. God, no! He is not. Sweetheart, no. - If they killed him, I'll kill them. - They're not gonna kill him, honey. They're not gonna kill him. - How do you know? - Because I won't let them. We won't let them. All right? - We have to find him. We have to bring him back. - We will. We will, baby, I promise. I promise you. All right? It's gonna be okay, baby. It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay, sweetie. [Mouse click] - Jayne, why are you still up? - Oh, I can't sleep. - Can I get you something? - No, no, no, that's all right, thank you. Why are they making us wait? I don't understand. [Phone rings] - Hello? Yes, this is she. Okay, um, someone will there to pick you up right away. Okay. Uh, the afi agent is here. He's at the business station. - He came by bus? - Apparently. - I'll go get him. - [Whispering] Diego, sweetheart. Honey, why are you sleeping here? - [Whispering] Keeping her safe till dad comes back. - Well, good. That way, he won't have to worry about her, right? Sleep tight, baby, I love you. - I love you too. - Okay. - Senoravalseca. - Yes, I'm jayne valseca. - I'm Raul from afi. I'm here to help you negotiate your husband's release. - I'm sorry, I don't understand. Are you here alone? - Please, if we can talk inside? It's late. You're all in shock, and I'm probably not what you expected, I understand, but I can assure you that I am older than I look, and I've been doing this for a number of years. - Okay, but, um, we are in crisis situation here. No offense, you arrived by bus, and, uh, if I may ask, are you even armed? - Senora, I came like this for a reason. If I had made a more dramatic entrance, unmarked SUV, federal plates, lights flashing, it might have made you feel better about me, but it could have cost your husband his life, and put you and your children at risk. There's a way that these things work, and I can explain everything in the morning. - In the morning? No, no, no, we... We have to act now. This is... - Have the kidnappers contacted you? - No, not yet, they have not. - No. I don't expect they will, it's not their m.O. - But they could at any moment. - I doubt they will tonight. They're probably sleeping, which is what I recommend we do. - [Sighs] - But to be safe, if you can give me your user name and password for your email account... - And why? - We'll be logged in at headquarters. We have sophisticated software that can quickly identify the isp addresses that the kidnappers are sending from. - You don't just have me working on this with you, but you have all the resources of afi. - [Moans] [Keyboard clicks] [Sighs] - [Sighs] [Sniffs] Oh, jayne. [Cries] Oh, jayne. - There are many different types of kidnappings in Mexico. The most sensational happen in the drug trade, where the victims are never seen alive again, but the vast majority are for money. There are express kidnappings where prompt payment guarantees expedited service, but that's not what we have here. - How do you know? - Because it was meticulously executed by a highly coordinated group of men, who made themselves impossible to identify, and they left behind the hammer. - What does the hammer mean? - It's the calling card for the popular revolutionary army. - The e.P.R., but that's a... that's a political group, isn't it? - And they don't negotiate with private security firms like senorseptien's, which is why he referred you to us. - But what would a political group want with Eduardo? Why would they kidnap him, it doesn't make any... - To finance operations. But that's the good news. It's a business deal to them, a negotiation. They treat their victims comparatively well, and they never kill them. But it's not all good news. The ransom will be high, at least a million dollars. - We don't have that kind of money. - Well, obviously, they think you do. Another thing you need to know about e.P.R., which you're obviously learning, is that they move at their own pace. They control the negotiations. [Phone rings] - Senora, forgive me for being insensitive, but I need to see where you were attacked. - Uh, they... They, uh, they dragged Eduardo from the car to the Van that was right in front, and... I was over here, fighting them, [Laughs] Which is insane, I know, and I... [Sighs] Then I grabbed on to the wire and this... Then they pulled me into the Van with Eduardo on this side, and... They put something over my head so I couldn't see anything more. Not here, anyway. [Bar music and chatter] [Keyboard clicks] [Phone rings] - Hello, luiz? Okay, we'll be right there. It's the kidnappers, they emailed. - Yes, I know. I'm on my way to the situation room. [Overlapping chatter] Uh-huh. Yes. Okay. Um, yes, that's it. That's it. We got it. - Excellent. They're tracing the email now. - Listen up, everyone. - Eduardo valseca's kidnappers just contacted his wife. When we get a GPS read on the location, I want them to move. Stay on this. [Overlapping chatter] [Email alert chime] - In what American state did jayne and Eduardo meet? Oh, they know everything about us. [Sighs] - "Senorajayne, we hope you got home okay. "In all future communications we will write you by email, "and you will respond by placing ads "in the newspapers that we designate. "Place the following in the want ads section "of noticias diarias in the animals and pets section. "Buy chow chow dog Austin, vaccinated with complete pedigree, 8,000 pesos." That's it? What... What does this mean? - It means they're demanding $8 million for Eduardo's release. - What? [Gasps] - It's a big number, but the initial demand always is. Remember, this is a negotiation. - How can I negotiate that? And... and place ads in newspapers? Why can't I just email them like this? I don't understand. - They know we'll be tracing I.P. Addresses. They'll use a different one every time. Open up anonymous accounts, and then close it. We'll trace all of them, in case they slip up, but they'll send them from busy Internet cafes, where there are no surveillance cameras, and the customers pay with disposable cash cards. - Well, what does this mean, "buy chow chow dog, Austin, vaccinated with"... Austin. Wait a minute. Austin, the land deal, Cal. - Who is Cal? - Cal wimberley. He's a real estate developer in Austin. He's been talking with Eduardo and me about purchasing part of our ranch to build a golf course. He hasn't made a formal offer, but the number we've been kicking around is 8 million. Otherwise this land is just a beautiful piece of property. We can't even borrow against it. - Was this land deal common knowledge? - No, although Santa Natalia is a very small community. I'm sure that some people must know. - Well, that probably explains the size of the demand. - Maybe Cal is willing to buy now. - [Over speaker] Obviously, I'll do everything I can to help secure Eduardo's release, but you have to understand, I don't have the money. I'll need to secure a commitment from my usual financing sources. It'll take at least a few weeks, maybe a month. - A month? - And there's the same complication as with the cd account. The title to the land is in Eduardo's name. - But we can work around that, can't we? - Under the circumstances, a judge might Grant jayne power of attorney. - Of course he will. In the meantime, I'll move this along as fast as I can, jayne. I promise. - Okay, thank you very much, Cal. Probably at least a month. - Even if you get the 8 million, it wouldn't be smart to offer it to the kidnappers. - So how should I respond to the ad? - Let them know that you're concerned about senorvalseca, and doing everything you can to secure his release. - Concerned? I'm goin' out of my mind. - Hola, senora. - I have to tell Maria what's happening. Why don't you draft a response that you think is appropriate. - Okay. - You can do that? Take people for money? - These are very, very bad people, sweetheart. - Was one... was that man in the car with you one of the bad men? - No, no, no. He's, uh, he's trying to protect us. His name is Raul. - I want daddy back. - I know you do, sweetheart. We all do. "Looking to buy Austin chow chow puppy. "Vaccinated with complete pedigree. "The funds required not presently in hand, working to acquire same." Yes, and that's in tomorrow's edition? The animal and pets section? Yes? Okay, thank you very much. [Phone beep] Okay, now what? - If e.P.R. Is true to form, it won't be good. [Metal doors open] [Struggles] - Oof! [Groans] [Coughs] Oh! [Gasps] Okay. - "Must move, urgently. Or they will kill me." Keep writing! - "You must move urgently, or they will kill me, jayne. "Don't tell them the funds are not in hand, "we have the money, you know we do. "Why are you lying to them? "Have you abandoned me? "Have you become a cold, heartless bitch, who cares nothing for the man who loves her?" - We, uh, we have to make a counter-offer. - You can't. - We have over $1/2 million in the bank. - They won't take it, it's not enough. - I don't care! You read Eduardo's letter, they're gonna kill him! - They won't kill him, they're posturing. - And what he said, what Eduardo said, he doesn't really think that I abandoned him, does he? Please tell me he... - You know that's not Eduardo writing, it's the kidnappers. Their goal is to frighten you and bully you into giving them what they want. The most effective way to do that is through your husband. - How do you know this? How do you know this? - I've been in this situation before. - Well, this is not a situation for me. This is my husband, and they're torturing him. Luiz, I'm going to the market. - Senora. - Please, give me the bag, I need to get... - Senora, that's not a good idea. - Let's go together. - I need to get outta here and do something. - Raul! I think I found something. I found these this morning. Could those be the kidnappers'? - It's possible. - Can they help you figure out who they are? - They might. Good work. [Overlapping chatter] - All right. Muchas gracias. [Engine starts] [Engine starts] [Phone rings] - Senora? - I'm just leaving the open-air market, and I'm being followed. - All right. Where are you now? - I'm on my way home, I should be there in a few minutes. - Don't panic. Meet me at the gate. It'll be open. - Okay. - I need you to go inside. - Is something wrong? - Find Maria, keep her safe. Okay? - Got it. - Stay inside! [Tires screech] [Tires screech] - Where's Maria? - She's in her room. - What's happening? What is it? - Open the gate! Open the gate, just open the gate! - All right. [Tires screech] [Tires screech] [Tires screech] - Are you okay? - Um, yeah. - It's okay. [Sobs] - Are you all right? - [Sighs] [Whimpers] - Yes. It's registered in guanajuato so it could be local. I'll also be express-mailing you some cigarette butts we found on the property. They could be the kidnapper's. - Okay. - Thank you. - We need to I.D. These plates. One of the kidnappers followed senoravalseca home. Car's probably hot but who knows. Maybe e.P.R. Got sloppy this time. - So what was that all about? Are they trying to kidnap me too? - No. They're just trying to intimidate you. - Well, they're doing a damn good job of it. - Their goal is to wear you down until you give them what they want. - I can't give them what they want. Not until Cal comes through. - But what if they come on the property? What if they threaten the children? [Gunshot] [Gun clacks] - If anyone tries to threaten me again, or my kids... - I understand. - You should know that our guns are not registered. - I don't have a problem with that. - Good. [Gunshot] [Sirens wail] - That acknowledges that we are returning your vehicle. Since we haven't heard anything to the contrary, I presume your husband is still missing. - Yes, that's right. - How many weeks has it been now? It's too bad. We would have secured his release by now. - Thank you. - We'll let you know if we need anything else. [Whispers] Let's go. - [Under breath] Took them long enough. [Guns clicking] - Okay. Thanks. The car belongs to a woman in Santa Natalia. It was missing from her garage the time you were threatened, but she didn't report it because sometimes her nephew borrows her car without asking. - Okay. Well, could it have been her nephew that followed me home? - He's a junior in high school. [Phone rings] And we didn't find a match in our database for any of the DNA on the cigarette butts. - Of course not. Luiz, I can't talk to anyone right now. - It's Cal wimberley calling from Texas. - Cal! Hey, Cal. It's great to talk to you. Are we close? - I'm afraid not. - Oh. Okay, um... So, how much longer because it's... it's been almost a month. It's been over a month. - Jayne, I really hate to tell you this, but... The deal's not going to happen. - What? - It's just that money's gotten incredibly tight right now, what with the economy, and... Mexico's not considered a smart investment right now. - Cal, Santa Natalia's a-a great investment. It's... it's beautiful here. Our property is beautiful. - It's not the land, jayne. It's the violence, the crime. Well, you know, you've been affected by it more than anyone. - I need that $8 million, Cal. - I can't get it, jayne. None of my partners are interested. [Sniffling] - I counted on that money, Cal. I counted on you, Cal. - Jayne. I'm so sorry. I tried to convince him, but... - Money is tight for us too, and right now, it's just, with no guarantee of getting it back... - But Olivia, Eduardo would never renege on a debt. Olivia, you know that. Come on! - I know. But... - But what? Come on. - What if he doesn't come back? - What are you saying? That... - No. - That he's dead, Olivia? - Sweetie... It's... it's a possibility. - It is not possible! It is not possible. And I will never stop believing that Eduardo is alive, Olivia, never. - Jayne? - I wondered why you stopped coming around to help us, and now I know why, Olivia. I... now I know why. - We remain deeply interested in purchasing your chow chow. But there is no way on earth we can meet your price. We must arrive at a more reasonable figure. Please respond in good faith. - Yes. - Come on. [Blade unsheaths] - So... You wish to negotiate a lower price. There is no way on earth you can give us what we want. In that case, Eduardo is sending you an incentive to think otherwise. Take the highway west out of town. When you cross the arroyo, go north 5 1/2 kilometers. There's a turn on the road. Stop there. In front of the dead tree, buried in the ground, you'll find a gift from your husband. - [Screaming] [Grunting] - Would you like me to open it for you? - They're I.O.U.S. - I.O.U.S? - Signed by Eduardo, made out to local businessmen and friends. - I.o.u.s for what? - To advance me money that he'll pay back for his release. - That's a novel way to collect a ransom. - Well, it's worth a shot. - There's nothing I can do with these, jayne. - But... but this is Eduardo's signature. You know that it is. - But these are not legally viable instruments. Have any of the parties on these notes accepted that? - No. That's why I brought them to the... to the bank. I thought that if you could guarantee them... - We can't. - This is Eduardo's life, okay? It's his life. If these instruments are not viable, then I need access to our savings account, and I need it now! - I'm as frustrated as you are. - No, you're not! - [Sighs] Jayne, please. Things move slowly in Mexico. - Obviously. May I have my papers back? - [Sighs] I'm very sorry. - I am too. - [Laughs] - Get it! Get it! Kick it to Raul. - Pass it to me. - Otra ves. Pass it. - Pass it to me, Diego. - Kids! Go in the house now, please. Diego, Maria, inside the house, please. Now. Now! In the house, please. Is this what you do to get my husband back? By playing soccer with them? - Senora... I know you're frustrated. - No! You are not their father, okay? Their father is somewhere being tortured right now. - I know what you're going through. - Oh, geez, you have no idea what I am going through! What it feels like to know that my husband so desperately needs me... The father of those children... And everything I do to save him comes to nothing! That every day that he's not released brings him closer to death. And if he dies, I die. You have no idea how I feel. - [Grunts] [Horse neighing] - Beautiful animal, senora. It's a pity you have to sell it. Are you selling the ranch as well? - No, I'm not. - I'm in the market for a ranch in the area. I can pay cash. - I'm not in the position to sell. - No? - No. - I understand senora desperately needs money. - Are you interested in the horse or not, sir? - How much are you asking? - Uh, $10,000. - $3,000. I'll give you $3,000. - $8,000. That's the lowest I can go. - $4,000. I can't go any higher. - Cash? - Mommy? - Yes, love? - Here, take it. Give it to the bad man so daddy can come home. - Come here. Thank you, sweetheart. - Mommy? - Yes, baby? - Sometimes, I forget what daddy sounds like. - [Sniffing] I know, baby. I know. [Latin music] ♪ ♪ [Spanish acoustic guitar music] ♪ ♪ - Raising funds as quickly as possible. Still difficult. Again, request lower asking price. - No, wait. [Groans] No... [Gun cocks] No! No, no! - What is it? - "You do not take us seriously, senora. "Here is proof that you should. "If you do not respond with numbers that are satisfactory, we will shoot Eduardo in the other leg." - I know that it looks bad. I've seen them do this before. They're just ratcheting up the intimidation. Listen to me. They shoot through the muscle at close range. That cauterizes the wound. If they have antibiotics, which I promise you they do, other than the pain of that gunshot and whatever recovery time Eduardo needs, there's no permanent damage or loss of function. They're just doing this to get to you. - [Sniffs] - Stop! - No. - Always remember, he's just merchandise. They won't really hurt him. He's far too valuable. - It's almost like waterboarding, isn't it? Make the victim feel as if they're going to die. Pull him back from the brink, make him... Then do it again and again and again. [Sighs] And I'm the victim. - Only if you choose to be. - Mom, Raul. Come play. - Okay, let's do it. - Pass it, pass it, pass it. - Diego, no. - Okay. Nice, nice. Good, good. [Phone rings] - I need to talk to you. - Esta bien. - How much? - Excuse me? - How big of a service fee do I have to give you to gain access to my money? - Service fee? I-I don't... - Isn't that what you want, to free up my money, is a bribe, yes? - Jayne... No, of course not. - Then why won't you release our money to me? - Because I can't. - What do you mean you can't? Of course you can. - The bank won't let me. - Of course. Why disperse hundreds of thousands of dollars that you don't expect to get back when you can hold onto it and earn interest. - This is not my decision, jayne. - Then whose decision is it? - I apologize for this. I tried to explain to senoravalseca that... The banks' hands are tied... That there is nothing we can do. - I would like you to listen very carefully. My husband is being held in captivity and tortured. And for months now, this bank has refused to release funds that could free him. Money that is his. Money that you have no legal or moral right to hold on to. So this afternoon, I'm filing a lawsuit against the bank for misappropriation of funds and intentional infliction of pain and suffering. And if Eduardo is murdered or dies in captivity, I will make it a wrongful death action. Do you understand? - This is not what I meant when I said, "don't choose to be a victim." I meant "don't let them get to you." - You saw the photo... how much more can Eduardo endure? If I keep negotiating with them on their terms, keep selling off everything that Eduardo and I have, there will be nothing left, and it'll be too late. - You cannot give e.P.R. An ultimatum. - Yes, I would like to place an ad in tomorrow's classifieds in the animals and pets section. Account number 6-5-7-3-2. "We have funds in hand to purchase your chow chow. 600 pesos. This is our sole and final offer." - [Muttering angrily] - Well, that's all the money we have... every last cent. And they're not going to get any more. - You know how they'll respond? - [Sighs] Yeah. - And you're prepared for that? - I don't know. I hope so. - But if I don't fight to get Eduardo back, I won't get him back. - No, no... [groans] [Echoing gunshot] - All right. Okay, I have it up. - Everything's in place. - Okay. Keep me posted. - I will. Has senoravalseca backed down from her position at all? - Not an inch. [Phone beeps] An e.P.R. Defector contacted us. In return for his immunity, he's giving us information. He says there's a hostage being held in Angelica. - And it's Eduardo? - We don't know. But it could be. We're raiding the location this afternoon. - Read it. Read it! - "We have made our sole and final offer. "If it is unacceptable, "keep your chow chow. "If we never see it "or hold it in our arms again, so be it." [Dogs barking] - Shoot you, tell her your suffering will continue, and this is her answer? "Take it or leave it." How are we supposed to respond to that? - [Sighs] - What? - Believe her. [Quietly sobbing] - I'm sorry it wasn't Eduardo. - I'm just glad that no one was hurt. And another family is celebrating. - They are. But e.P.R. Held this man for over a year. - He's back home, but getting back to normal... It won't be e... - Raul, I understand that by giving the kidnappers an ultimatum, I am taking a huge risk, and it absolutely terrifies me. But Eduardo is my husband, so ultimately, it's my decision and my responsibility to bring him home safely, not yours. If I fail, I'll fail on the only terms that makes sense to me. And I will try to accept the consequences. Can you understand that? - Yes, I can. [Car door shuts] - Hola, senor. Gracias. Can I help you? Do you want something because I am right here! Hello, can you look at me? [Engine starts] - Hey! Hey! Hey! Talk to me! [Speaking Spanish] [Email alert chimes] - Mom, are you okay? - What is it? - [Softly crying] They accepted the offer. They're ready to release Eduardo. They're going to release dad. They're ready to let Eduardo go. [Crying and laughing] - Here are our instructions. Deviate from them in any respect, and you will never see your husband again. The ransom needs to be paid in unmarked, non-sequential U.S. hundred-dollar bills. [Zipper rasps] - You are to drive to Mexico City with an associate. Your husband has suggested Gustavo ortego. - Jayne? Hi. - Hey. - How are you? - I'm fine. How are you? - I'm, uh, disappointed in myself. Ashamed. You came to us for help and I... - You don't have to explain. I understand. - I do think Eduardo is still alive. I really want to. - I appreciate that. I'll call, okay? - Yeah. - Okay. Okay. - Good for you for keeping up with the yoga. You look great. - Yeah. - Do not bring anyone else. If we suspect afi agents or any other law enforcement officers are monitoring your movements, we'll immediately execute Eduardo. - They won't make it easy. - I know. - Remember, don't give them the money until you have the proof of life. Cuidado, Gustavo. - [Whispers] Be careful. - It's almost over. I'll be back for Diego's birthday. [Sighs] Thank you. Thank you. I'll be back. [Engine starts] Let's go. - When you arrive in Mexico City, check into the motel we have designated. Await our further instructions. We will contact you there. [Email alert chimes] Leave the motel now. [Knocks on door] Mark the letter "t" on your vehicle with duct tape. Drive to the bridal shop at the following address. Drive to the following address. There you will find a telephone where we have left instructions. Now, drive to the mercado at the address below. [Phone beeps] Now drive to the bakery at the address below. Now drive to the jewelry store at the address below. - Senora. - [Sighs] - This is... This is today's edition. He's alive. - "Here is your proof of life. Now, proceed to the following destination." - [Sighs] Okay. - Wait for our signal. [Engine shuts off] Do not attempt to get out of the car. And keep your hands visible at all times. We will be watching you. [Tires screeching] [Engine revving up] - Where's Eduardo? Where's... where's Eduardo? - No se, senora. - Where is he? - Where is he? Where is he? [Crying] Where is he? [Screaming] Where is he? I don't understand. [Screaming] I don't understand! [Screaming and sobbing] [Cellphone rings] - I'm here. When? - A few hours ago. We stayed, hoping they'd bring Eduardo, but... [Crying] But they haven't... - Okay, go to the motel. Call me as soon as you get there. [Cell phone beeps] - What happened? - They took the money, but they didn't release Eduardo. - [Softly] Oh, no. - Excuse me. - [Sighs] - [Sighs] - Raul? - This isn't how they work. Something's terribly wrong. [Email alert chimes] - "We have the money. "We counted it. "It is all here in unmarked bills as we have requested. You may return to Santa Natalia." [Engine starts] - Blow out the candles. Yay! Mwah. Happy birthday, honey. - I made a wish. I wished that... - No, don't say it out loud, sweetheart. - I want some cake. - I know you do. I do too. Let's do this. All right, get those candles out of there. - I'll finish up. - Thank you, luiz. - Nothing. - [Sighs] So they never kill their hostages. You told me that, right? - Yes. I did. - Then we just have to believe that this is... No different. We did everything we could, Raul. - I hope so, senora. - Senora. You realize that you have never once called me jayne. I don't think I ever learned your last name, either. - Actually, senora... You never really learned my first. - Hmm. - You can't do that. - Stop, Diego. - Only move to the sides. - Maria. - Keep it there. - You're cheating. - I'm not cheating. He's cheating. - Can't do that. - Yes, I can. - You can only move to the sides. [Water running] [Softly] - Eduardo. Eduardo? Eduardo! Eduardo! Eduardo. [Softly] - Jayne. - Daddy? - [Sobbing] - Daddy! Daddy! - [Crying] [Sniffling]
