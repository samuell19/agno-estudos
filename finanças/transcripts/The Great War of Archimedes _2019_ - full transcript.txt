All aircraft in attack formation. (April 7, 1945, Bonomisaki) Commence bombing run. (April 7, 1945, Bonomisaki) Okay boys this is! (April 7, 1945, Bonomisaki) Bombs away! (April 7, 1945, Bonomisaki) Bombs away! Right, hit the right! Shoot! Shoot! Left! Shoot! Hey, move fast! Hurry up! Shoot! I got it! (More than 3000 crew members dying in the battle) (12 years ago) In 1933 Japan was at the center of a tumultuous era. Tried to restore the country that was in decline as a result of the Great Depression. And the establishment of the puppet Manchukuo was proclaimed in 1932. Intensified the confrontation with the European and US' powers who also invaded China. Japan withdrew from the League of Nations that year. Japan was becoming more isolated from the world. The Great War of Archimedes Translation: neet21 [these subs may contain inaccuracies and grammar mistakes] (Navy First Air Force, Aircraft Carrier Akagi) (Commander-in-Chief of The Combined Fleet Yamamoto Isoroku) Get ready to take off! Get ready to take off! Take off! Take off! That's great. It's taking off. - It's working. It's working. - Great. That's great. Rear Admiral, all the planes made a successful flight. The Imperial Japanese Navy has conquered the sea and the sky. It's a great pleasure. I heard we're working on the world's large warship construction. The Imperial Navy will become more elite. - There's no need to build another warship. - What? There will soon be a time when more aircraft carriers will be needed. In future wars, the warships will no longer be used. Come in. Excuse me. (Major General Fujioka Shipwright) Fujioka, is it finished? I want you to take a look at it. This looks great. There's also military equipment for airstrikes. I'm sure this is definitely the new aircraft carrier you adore. That's a blessing, there's someone in the Naval Shipbuilding Department who really knows what I want. We already withdrew from the League of Nations. The Army will definitely act more boldly. So, the war with US and UK will also ... What do you mean? It's just a precaution. But, for one in ten thousand possibilities we have to cut some fixed spending budgets. But, conservatives in the selection committee are more powerful. It's not that easy to change their minds. And the tough one is still ... Yes, Major General Shimada from the Department of Army. Ah, Shimada ... If we get into a fight with him … (Ministry of Navy) I heard about that. Please help us. Leave it to me. Leave it to me. (Marshal Admiral Nagano Osami) (Marshal Admiral Nagano Osami) I can't let Shimada get what he wants. (Marshal Admiral Nagano Osami) I can't let Shimada get what he wants. This time, a new warship will be built to replace the old warship, Kongou. (The First Day of New Ship Review Conference) At this time, you propose to build an aircraft carrier. - What are you thinking about, Fujioka? - That's because ... I've said this many times. The aircraft carrier will be the main force in the future war. Is this another one of your aviation doctrines? (Admiral Shimada Shigetaro) But, never once it has proved successful in an air attack, has it? (Minister of the Navy Osumi Mineo) To sum it up, replacing Kongou ... with an aircraft carrier is not an option. VS Admiral Mineo ... I'd like you to consider the future war. If we want to focus on the future, the answer is clear. It'd definitely be better to build an aircraft carrier. What are you talking about? If we're going to build a new warship the most important thing is to build a great warship that symbolizes The Imperial Japanese Navy. A huge, elegant, and powerful warship. This is what the Combined Fleet really needs. Huge and elegant are no match for war. The aircraft carrier is the key to the future war. I don't know what you're talking about. Even kids know that naval battle is artillery warfare. This is the tradition of our Imperial Navy since the Russo-Japanese War! I don't think this is the time for artillery warfare. - So you are saying we don't need a warship? - Yes. We don't. What did you say? If we have a lot of budgets to spend just build more aircraft carriers. Attacking from the sky is the work of despicable people. It's a shame for the Imperial Navy that I'm proud of. The naval fleet attack is the navy's wish. And even if we send out hundreds of those flimsy planes they'll be shot down easily. You are so outdated. The aircraft has been evolving. In the next five years, the way we fight the war will change radically. If you really want to have a big gun battle you can do it with the old warship. What do you mean, you ... a navy officer insulted a ship. Do you know what a sense of shame is? And you have ... been such a pain in the ass since you were in military school. Wait up! What are you talking about? “Since you were in military school?” May I interrupt? As you please, Lieutenant General Hirayama. (Lieutenant General of Naval Hirayama Tadamichi) Actually, I have a proposal for a new warship. (Lieutenant General of Naval Hirayama Tadamichi) I've also prepared the model design for a new warship. This ... This is what we wanted. This is actually what we wanted. This looks so great. It's so beautiful. It's a huge warship that suitable for Combined Fleed's flagship. My philosophy is to show the majesty and demeanor of The Imperial Japanese Navy to the world. So, I designed this warship. That's great. I'm very honored that you like it. Minister, take a look from a different angle. It looks really great. What a beautiful curve. Let's stop enjoying the model. That's rude. We're now seriously reviewing the warship. What kind of reviewing? The design of the warship doesn't matter. Our mission isn't to build a passenger ship. Considering the future war, we should adopt Fujioka's design. What are you talking about? If there is such a magnificent warship the sailors will surely come. What are you talking about? The conclusion will be released at the decision-making meeting half a month later. Shimada and Hirayama ... I can't believe they did such a thing. So, what are we going to do? This time the new warship will surely be designed by Hirayama. - Honestly, I really want to avoid it. - That's for sure. How do you expect they will snatch this opportunity? What do we do, Fujioka? I think today's design is the best design I could think of. Do you really understand the situation? The Minister really likes Hirayama's warship design. - If you can't win the best design一 - But ... I know, I know. I'll leave it to you. Let's get our spirits up first. - Ma'am, ma'am! - Coming. - Are you calling me? - Yeah. I want to forget the boring world for a while, give us some glass of wine. Can you also get us three pretty girls, please? Well, that's ... What's the matter? I'm so sorry, all the girls are at the party. What? The next one is the chest. Who first? What do you pay a high price for our measurements? Will you give us kimonos? I'm measuring because I just want to measure it. As long as it's beautiful I want to measure it. That's very sweet. Here, excuse me. No way! Excuse me. Sorry to intrude. It's very disturbing that you've packed all the girls by yourself. Can we take a few? Would you mind getting out of here? You son of a bitch. He is Rear Admiral Yamamoto, watch your words. Why should I? Besides I'm not a navy. And I've always hated navies. How dare you! - So let's move on. - Let's do it. Okay. Why do you hate navies? You guys aren't beautiful at all. That's rude! But, why? Do you know Japan spends 40% of its national budget accounts on military costs. And it grows up every year. Navies and plutocrats are in the league. They keep adding military equipment that doesn't fit them. Therefore, ordinary people are being trapped in poverty and suffering. In other words, you're outraged at the plight of the poor. No, I don't have any interest in how poor people live. But, it's so out of balance, there's no sense of beauty at all. I don't like things that have no sense of beauty. - Now, throw that fan like you just did. - Okay. Beautiful! Perfect trajectory! How did you do that? - Dude, it looks like you know magic. - This is the first time I've seen such a thing. It's simple. Use math formulas to calculate the motion trajectory of the fan. And the initial speed of the fan you throw out is basically the same and then all you have to do is throw the fan from the calculated starting point. Because numbers never tell a lie. - You're such a genius. - That's impressive. Why are you still here? But also, I'm actually the same as you guys. I used to work as a tutor at Ozaki's family. Does the Ozaki family that you just mentioned refer to Ozaki Shipbuilding Company? Not only that, Ozaki's also made me study at Imperial University. I dropped out of the Imperial University because I did a thing that upset him. So, I want to run out of all the dirty money I've made there. That's why I'm so spendthrift. Well, then. It's been five minutes since you guys came into this room. Their prices are 2 yen 30 cents per person for an hour. So, five minutes cost you 19.2 cents, and there are eight people in total. You wasted 1 yen and 53.6 cents of my money that's not a small amount of money. Would you please go back right now? That's so fast. Of course. I was in the Department of Mathematics at Imperial University until this February. Where are the girls? We were driven back by a cocky student. - What? student? - Anyway, he's indeed an interesting guy. The Department of Mathematics at Imperial University. Mathematical calculations ... and number operations. Yamamoto, what are you thinking of? According to today's estimate calculation Fujioka's design costs 93 million. On the other side, Hirayama's design costs 89 million. These two projects are equivalent to 170 billion and 160 billion in the present days respectively. So, what's wrong? What do you think of Hirayama's design cost? What do I think of? Hirayama's warship design far beyond Fujioka's in any aspect. And they need to have a strong-armed force. That's not all it's gonna cost. - Maybe they lied about the cost budget. - That's what I also thought of. How about this. We calculate the cost budget of Hirayama's design. - Calculate? - Yeah. Prove that he lied about his cost budget to impeach him. If we could prove it, his design won't work either. Put forward such a ridiculous plan that's an insult and bad behavior to the decision-making meeting. It's a betrayal of the country, Japanese people and of course the emperor, too. If we confronted them with such a violent manner The Minister had to reject Hirayama's design. It's gonna be hurt, that's what we really want. Well, Fujioka, you do it. You mean it should be me? You're a shipwright, aren't you? Recalculating the cost budget of Hirayama's design is a piece of cake for you. Let me refute that. It's not easy to calculate the cost budget of a warship. Detailed design and a price-list of all kinds of equipment are required. And before you do that you need the data of how many laborers and how long the project will take. - You need more一 - All right. In short, you can't do it, right? It's not only me that can't do it. Even if you look all over Japan you won't find the one who can calculate the cost budget of Hayama's design in two weeks. It's beautiful. Perfect proportions. There's gotta be some kind of secret in it. Sure enough, this part has a silver ratio. Daddy? You still see this guy? - Get the fuck out of here! - Get out of here. Come here! How can you repay my kindness with this! Shameless! Shameless! I'm sorry I almost hit you on the face. We thought you'd be sleeping till morning. I'm sorry. Let's keep drinking! Ma'am! Bring the wine in, please! Come in. It's Tanaka, I'm coming in. Did you find out any information? As you speculated he used to be a student at Imperial University and he does have a brilliant talent. He's a high-profile young man for the future of mathematics. The only man who can compete against a physicist, Hideki Yukawa. People used to call him, a math genius. He even ever been called that? But he dropped out of Imperial University. I have already heard that. The problem is he dropped out of college. He's not only lashed out at Ozaki Shipbuilding Company. He's going after Ozaki's daughter. No matter how urgent this is, bring him to the navy will ... With all due respect, I strongly object. But, to solve the urgent problem I don't really care that kind of thing. They also say he had a snake in his bosom (treacherous man). There's a more powerful bug than a snake that trying to eat out the navy. I'm heading out. Kai! You ... You, come over here! What's going on? What to do? What ... wait ... I'm sorry I came uninvited. Even so, what can I do? In order to withdraw that ridiculous shipbuilding proposal we're going to expose the fake of cost budget they have made up. I'm sure you can do it with your math calculation skills. Pretty please. I refuse. I told you, didn't I? I hate navies. Besides, it's impossible. Why? - I'm going to US tomorrow. - US? All the admissions to Princeton University have been completed. That's the best place to study mathematics. Even so, can you reconsider? That's impossible. It's a great opportunity for me to come back from the dead. I won't waste this opportunity. So, please, go back. Kai ... It's about the fate of the whole country. I'm desperate for Japan and that's why I'm going to US. I have no interest in what this country will be. Asshole, are you even a Japanese? This radical method is useless. I've given up on Japan, can you go back? War will break out. What did you just say? I said the war will break out. Which country is Japan going to go to war with? At that time, I'm afraid ... US, a place you're going to go to will be our main enemy. Stop saying stupid things. Don't be silly, there's no way you can win. What makes you so sure? It's more obvious than seeing the fire. The industrial capacity, for example. It'd about 50-1 what US has. And the oil production is about 120-1. Fighting a country with such a wide gap even kids know it's impossible to win. Numbers never tell a lie. If you're that sure you should know how dangerous the warship they're trying to build is. That's the world's largest and strongest warship. The ignorant people and belligerent sailors they have the illusion that this warship alone will triumph over US. We must avoid that. That's stupid. Will you be able to continue your studies in US by then? How many times do I have to refuse before you leave this place? I lost my fingers in the previous war. War takes away everything. The warship they trying to build will definitely lead to war. We have to stop them. That kind of person. We don't want him in yet. He doesn't have the pride of being a Japanese. I still have hope. I've done enough to provoke his anger up. Anger? I'd like to introduce you to someone. Kai, come in. Excuse me. Who is he? He's a math student at Imperial College, Kai Tadashi. In the Department of Mathematics, he is called a genius once in a century. Although he's now my daughter's tutor but in the future, he'll be a guy who carries the whole of Japan. Would you please let him sit in? If you are a genius please let me have your opinion. I'd also like to have your advice afterward. I'll remember you. Then, about the huge warship we've been talking about can we get my company involved in the construction? This time I want to build the world's largest warship. That's good. It must be about 300 meters long? 300 meters? In that case, how about the cannon set with a 50-centimeter caliber? It will scare the shit out of both US and UK. You don't have to worry about the construction cost budget. Money, there's always a lot. I'm sorry to interrupt. But that cannon set with a 50-centimeter caliber how many hits does it have? Well ... if the enemy doesn't move I think it can hit one out of ten. It's just 10%? But on the battlefield, the enemy must have moved around, and there are waves, too. If so, the actual hit rate would be only about 1% or 2%. In bad weather conditions that's a much lower hit rate. The efficiency of naval warfare is not very high. Kai! No, I just think it's a little ridiculous. You kid, you know nothing about warships. I don't know much about warships, but I do know numbers. It's such a waste to build a vase warship. I think it would be better to quit. Shut up! I'll show you some respect. Get the hell out of here! Don't get any closer to my daughter anymore. Those stupid people squandered the state's property. The officers fight for power the plutocrats fight to enrich their own pockets. Build up unnecessary warships one after another. The growth of the military has given people an illusion of national strength. So, as to publicize the national prestige to the outside world. If it really got that far the war would be inevitable. It hurts! Watch your step! Sorry, please let me pass. Sorry, please let me pass. Kyoko? Kai sensei! What are you doing here? I heard that you are heading to US. It's all because of me, isn't it? You don't have to blame yourself. I'm the one who couldn't resist and measured you. That's all. Please forgive my father. Even if it's not now, there'll be a chance for you two to get better一 There'll be not a chance at all. It will only add fuel to the fire. There's no turning back. That's it. Sensei! How could it be? It doesn't make any sense in math. No matter what happens, going to US is the way I should choose. What's there to be hesitant about? That guy. He's really coming. As I said yesterday I want you to do your best to calculate the total cost budget of the warship. It's just ... we've only got two weeks until the next meeting. In two weeks? There may be a little bit of time but please do your best. That's why we're looking at your mathematical calculation skills. As for your rank, it'll be a Major, what do you think? A Major? Is he going to be an officer? Wait a minute. Isn't this an external mandate? If I had to become a professional officer, it's not the deal. If it's a Major, I'd like to say no. You bastard! Do you even know the meaning of a Major? He let you be a Major, it's a privilege. That kind of false reputation is just a problem for me. What's wrong with you? That's a Major. Lieutenant Tanaka. He has no sense of military ranks. Even so, that's too rude. Kai. Navy is a high-level organization. In many cases, identity is a passport. In military, with ranks all of the officers in height position get respects to speak in everything. In that case, we're trying to stop Hirayama's warship design. It's going to be totally impossible without it. So, I'm just gonna have to accept it, right? Yes. I'll send Tanaka to be your valet. What? He'll help you to look after your everyday necessities​ and take care of everything about ministry matters. Wait a minute, I will be his valet? Yes, please do it. No, that's... Please take good care of me. I'm just a Lieutenant. Your rank is now much higher than mine. Please don't honor me. So, this is the navy's building. Looks like it costs a lot of money. Of course, it's the navy's central authority. You'll take control of the navy's entire budget. You'll be assigned to the accounting department. (13 days before the final decision-making meeting) It's Lieutenant Tanaka, please let me in. Come in. So, this is you, the legendary genius. This is the first time I meet you, I'm Kai Tadashi. You finally came. I've been waiting for you. He is Lieutenant General Nagano. Yamamoto, this guy is a real talent, isn't he? Come on, have a seat. Excuse me. Yamamoto has told you about our plans, right? Yeah, I think so. Do everything you can. We want to prove that their cost budget numbers are all made up. And for that, I wouldn't mind if you can make it up a little. Nagano! He's a genius math at Imperial University. Let him use his ability. So, you're asking me to do something else? Kai, you don't have to. Nagano! It's just a joke to relieve tension. You don't have to stick to so many rules. We've set up a special accounting monitoring unit and you'll be the chief of the unit. The personal office is also ready for you to use as you wish. Thanks for taking care of me. It feels he's a bit stubborn. But it's also evidence that he's meticulous on numbers. I'm more interested in his math calculation skills than his personality. And ... Major Kai. Salute to the Chief. Can't you do it properly? It seems the navies are lack of discipline lately. No, because his major rank has just enlisted. Please excuse his rudeness. The newly enlisted major? I was appointed to become a navy major's accountant since yesterday. I'm Kai Tadashi. Did they transfer you from Department of Treasury? It's just that you're so young to be a Major. The military officer ranks are getting cheaper. He is Lieutenant General Hirayama, who is competing with Major General Fujioka for a shipbuilding proposal. So this is the one who's going to throw a thousand dollars into the shit hole. By the way, you have been warned yesterday. Would you stop using honorific to me? Please be considered for my position, too. This is such a dim room on the north side. Looks like I'm an uninvited guest to this organization. I'll take care of the hat and the belt. 1.45 x 0.85 1.241 sq.m What's wrong? Please don't mind I just doing my hobby. Honorific. Oh, I forgot again. This matter should not be delayed, Lieutenant Tanaka. Show me Hirayama's design. It's all here. What? Is the warship's construction proposal this thin? It was written by Major General Fujioka through his memories. It's not an official document. The information on the new warship construction plan belongs to the highest military secret, The Military Aircraft. The information is stored directly in the safe after the meeting. You can't get the original document. Then let's go and ask them, the so-called Military Aircraft to let us check it out. Only this information can be provided for you. We don't have the authority to check the Military Aircraft. So, you want me to figure out the total budget with that thin sheet of paper? Yes. Are you serious? What about Fujioka's? 93 million. And Hirayama's cost budget is 89 million. Is there less in Hirayama's? The Fujioka's design we support has a standard drainage capacity of 26,000 tons. The speed is 30 nautical miles because it's an aircraft carrier, so it's less weaponized. High-powered installations and aircraft carrier equipment, which the account for a large part of the budget. In contrast, the standard drainage capacity of Hirayama's design is 65,050 tons. Main gun caliber 46 cm, 3 in combination, 9 in total, speed 28 knots. It's a huge warship far beyond Fujioka's. So, it can't have less budget than Fujioka's. And to build such a warship, the shipyard has to be expanded. If you count these, how much will the cost budget reach? It's completely beyond estimate. So, the 89 million figure is a complete fluke? I'm afraid so. Do they have any plans to be so confident to implement this project? Or are there any other secrets behind it? Anyway, to figure out the exact numbers of Hirayama's cost budget you have to get me as much material as you can. I said that those kinds of documents belong to Military Aircraft. You can't make bricks without straw. Let's go. (Materials Management Room) I told you, we don't have the authority to access Military Aircraft. So, what exactly are we gonna do? Hey, wait a minute! (The Naval Technology Research Institute) It's me, Shimada. (The Naval Technology Research Institute) (The Naval Technology Research Institute) It's you, what's the matter? Someone is going to get in the way of our construction plan. Get in the way? The mastermind is Nagano but it's Yamamoto who is pulling the strings. In order to figure out our cost budget they have hired a math student at the Imperial University to be a Major accountant. A brash brat, Kai Tadashi. So, it's him? But, he's a math genius once in a century. On the other hand ... Isn't our cost budget a little bit lower than Fujioka's? If they figured it out ... Calm down, Major General Shimada. If you want to calculate the cost budget of a warship just two weeks is definitely not enough. Are you sure? You have my word. But, just in case don't give any data you need for the calculation to a guy named Kai. Even the price of a screw can't be disclosed to him. I have prepared for that. I see, just leave the rest to me. But if we go to Yokosuka by now we'll suppose to arrive before nightfall. I want to see how a real warship looks like. If I see it with my own eyes, I can really realize how much money is needed to build a warship. Use your own hands and eyes to feel it. Let's get in touch with it first. What? That's where Nagato (Japan's warship) anchors. Those all are warships. They are beautiful. Well, the warships are really beautiful. All right, let's get on board now. The heck? Are you kidding? How can we board now? You need to obtain prior permission. No, I will ask for permission, we're going to get on it. Can't you just stop thinking about it? It's a real warship, you can't get on it as you want easily. Isn't there away? It would have been impossible without Lieutenant General Nagano's arrangements. I heard that Lieutenant General Nagano and Captain Uno are very close. Your weakness is that you don't feel like you can do it before you even start it. It feels even bigger when you look it closely. This warship ... I think we've created some kind of sea monsters. It's completely dark. You can stay here tonight. (The Captain of Nagato Warship Uno Sekizo) Half the crew is ashore, so there's still room available. Nagano specifically asked me to treat you well. You can do whatever you like here. Thanks for taking care of us. I just got a bottle of scotch whiskey, I'll grab it. You guys just wait here for me. Lieutenant Tanaka, I'd like to see the design of this ship. Ah, that's not allowed. Hey, don't! There's no blueprint here. There are hundreds of blueprints that not usually placed on the ship. There's always a schematic diagram, right? It's possible that there's a schematic diagram If there were one, it should be in that closet, but ... Hey, wait! That's in the Military Aircraft, too. I don't think captain will show it to us easily. Then we're just gonna have to get him out of this room. What? - The heck? - We'll do it. In case we spy on the Military Aircraft without permission we'll be suspected of espionage. If it doesn't work out, you'll be sent out to a military court. We'll figure something else out. If you were afraid of everything, nothing could be done. Sorry I have kept you waiting. Let's have some drinks first. - By the way, Lieutenant Tanaka. - Yes? Shouldn't you send a telegram to Lieutenant General Nagano right now? I'm sorry, it's my negligence. Then, I'll arrange for someone to take you to the telegraph room. Captain, would you accompany me, please? Accompany you? There's something ... I'd like to ask you about some matters. Oh, I see. Then, you can enjoy yourself here. (General design drawings) Got it. Okay. Mastering the hull construction and configuration of various types of installations. I see, this is how a warship gets built. It's my first time I have tasted it, though. But I didn't expect that the authentic scotch whiskey would be so delicious. That's good. I'm glad you liked it. What? There ... What's wrong? You've become a Major, and you should've got to dress up like a Major. Thank you for your advice. What's he doing? I think we already got something last night. The whole ship was clearly shown on that sketch. I write down as much as I could during the time you took the captain out. You have crossed the line. What are you doing now? Don't you see it? I'm measuring this ship's size. Measuring? Are you trying to measure the entire ship manually? I've been trying to measure this ship since yesterday, and my hands itch like hell. The whole part of this ship? Want to measure beautiful things, isn't it a human instinct? Don't you want to measure the impulse of this ship? Not at all. You're such a weirdo. Isn't there something missing in you as a human being? You want to measure the size of this ship with a tape measure I think it's impossible. Even if it can't be measured perfectly the thickness of steel and the number of rivets can be counted. In short, write down all the data that can be measured manually first and then we can map this ship in numbers. The sketch I drew yesterday and the data we measured today. Although the information may be a drop in the bucket I want to use it to challenge the problem. And this warship is indeed symmetrical. As long as you measure half of it, you can get the whole measurement. Doing that ... is useless. Useless or not, I want to make my own decision after I trying it. We have to leave this ship by evening. There's not much time left for you. Just call me when the time is up. Stupid. Now, this is all I can do. Maybe this method is primitive and maybe it's trivial but there's nothing more to be done than this. If I wanted to do it, I had to do it well, even a screw can't be missed. It's almost the time to get off the ship. It's indeed really impossible to measure a ship in such a short time. Here you go. What's this? Here's some data that I have done my best to measure with my steps. One step is equivalent to 50 centimeters. If it can be any help, please use it. This is such a big help. I wanted to give you help as much as I can. First of all, we should draw out the structure outline of Nagato. What are you going to do with it? It's said that the size of the Hirayama's warship design is about 1.3 times the size of Nagato. Use the blueprint of Nagato and add up the size of the Hirayama's design we'll get a rough idea of the whole design. Have you ever drawn the blueprint of the ship? How could I have ever done it? What? So, you still want to draw the structure of that warship? You'd better not be kidding. Yes, it will be hard. But fortunately, there's a lot of reference books here about shipbuilding. I've read it all last night. This whole pile? We don't have much time. Let's get started. This guy really likes to mess around. It's a shame. Measuring Nagato with a tape measure? What the hell does that guy want to do? What's his purpose in measuring the hull of Nagato? I heard he was a genius math student at Imperial University. How could he be so stupid? As you can see, he is a fool indeed. I'm afraid it's because there's no access to any information and they're being forced into a corner. In the dilemma between expectation and reality he's about to collapse. The reputation of a math genius is so powerful but it seems he's just a freak. But, he behaves too badly, I think we shouldn't see down on him. I knew that. That's why I asked you to come here with all your busy schedule. I invited you over to discuss it. Well, then. About the previous proposal, is that okay with you? Well, just do as you say. This is the first time I meet you. I'm Lieutenant Takato. I'm Ozaki Kyoko. It's a gift from Admiral Shigetaro Shimada. Thank you. Do you need anything else? No, thank you for your time. Then, I'll take my leave. Speaking of which your former tutor has joined navy. Kai Tadashi. Is there anything you'd like me to say some words to him? No, nothing. Is there something between Kyoko and Kai? I don't know. I brought you supper. Thanks. How's it going? What, really? Oh, my. You've done so many. I think you're almost done. Ah, to be honest. I was still dubious when you said that you are going to draw the structure of a warship. But I didn't expect that you have done so many in just one day. Tonight, we're going to reproduce Hirayama's design based on this sketch. It's just that there's not enough data to figure out the total cost budget. I'll ask Major General Fujioka to provide us with more detailed information. Major Kai is so desperate here. Major General Fujioka should be willing to break some rules for us, too. We'd like to know further details about Hirayama's design. I know, but at least help us out. No, please, just ask for us, even if it's verbally一 Hello? Hello? Sorry. There seems to be no way to provide us with more detailed information. I knew that. What do you mean? If there were a layman who could figure out the cost budget within the deadline I don't think they'll be able to get off the stage. What? Are they just trying to save their faces? How could that be? It's a national matter. It's no use saying it now. I'll ask Commander Shigeoka to put pressure on them. It's useless. They will just use the Military Aircraft as an excuse. Even Lieutenant General Yamamoto can't do anything about it. I'm ready to fight alone. Let's recreate Hirayama's warship design. It looks like I'm going to stay up all night. Let me help you. No, you go eat first. Okay, I'll grab some food. (10 days before the final decision-making meeting) (10 days before the final decision-making meeting) I'm going to get breakfast. Okay. What kind of guy is he? Hey, look at that. (Kai Tadashi is a sexual predator he slept with Ozaki Kyoko) What's all this? Hey, what's up? What the hell is going on here? It says here why you dropped out. Because you had an affair with Ozaki's daughter. It's true I'm in love with Ozaki Kyoko. But the fornication, adultery, and those all nonsense are completely false accusations. It's all just her father's imagination. And put pressure on the university to drop me out. Don't pay any attention to this nonsense. That's ridiculous! In a place with a heavy responsibility for national defense how could such a foolish and shameless man stir up trouble? But now ... because of this we are completely isolated in navy base. What's the matter? It always feels like this part isn't perfect. Let me see. Actually, it's nothing. I just suddenly remember the data of the wave's swing. It has been concerned me all these times. I'm sorry. It's a blur to me. Yes, it's hard for you. Indeed. Never mind. Anyway, I'd better concentrate on finishing the drawings of Hirayama's design. There's enough space over there to put this down. Although it's still too early. But it's better to contact Shipbuilding Research Department. Yes, sir. (9 days before the final decision-making meeting) Have you finished? The enemies are finally beginning to show their true colors. A huge warship over 260 meters in length. Such a huge warship. It won't be possible that it's cheaper than an aircraft carrier. Well, yes. There's got to be something else. To expose the truth you have to go through the blueprint. And to recalculate the warship costs budget we also need to calculate the purchase price for each weapon and construction material. And of course the labor cost budget needs to be calculated, too. I need a price list of all items. But it's hard to do. I know, you're talking about the Military Aircraft again, aren't you? But I need it anyway. Is there any way to do it? If it's a private company it might help us. Private company? The shipbuilding operation is basically subcontracted to private companies. If we go to them, we might find some useful information. Sir, just give us a few minutes. It's about shipbuilding costs budget. Don't ask! - Sir, please have a moment. - Please go back. - Sir, please have a moment. - Please go back. It won't take you long. Just a few words. You guys are so annoying. I said no. Sir! We've been warned not to tell anything. Sir, please! Please! Just give us a little hint. I need your help, please! This is for the country. Sir, please! Although we've already expected this wouldn't work out. But I didn't expect the military to be so heavily fortified. It's so tough. They must have been pressured by Hirayama. We have to do something quickly. (8 days until the final decision-making meeting) You're Miss Ozaki Kyoko, aren't you? Kai Tadashi wants to see you. Sensei! Stop calling me sensei. I'm a navy now. You must really hate me, don't you? Why should I? Because of my father, you became... I have been playing with numbers and math formulas on my desk. But I realize that math has the power to change the world. It's all because of you that I feel that way. I don't hate you. You need a price list, don't you? Yeah, I thought maybe you could help me. I don't know about shipbuilding. My father never brought home the work-related documents. I see. Ah, that's okay. It's just my selfishness to ask you that. I just wanted to catch the last glimmer of hope and use it as an excuse. The truth is, I wanted to meet you. I'm glad you're doing this. I would do anything for you. I'm sorry I couldn't be of any help. I'll think of another way. Thank you for coming to see me today. Ah, I know. There's someone who might be able to help you. He had challenged the military headquarters and my father's methods. As a result, he has been prohibited to access the military. Who's he? He is Osato Kiyoshi. I heard he runs a small shipyard in Osaka. He used to come to my house a lot. When I was a little, he loved me so much. Thank you. This could be a big breakthrough for us. That's good. We don't have much time. Is it really okay to go to Osaka? Two days are wasted just on the round trip. It can't be helped. I'm afraid we can't get a price list in Tokyo. (7 days until the final decision-making meeting) It's right here. (Osato Shipbuilding Company) It's 6,000 yen, look at this properly. And it's the wrong date. Stop right there! what are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing? What's going on? These two just barged in. You are navy, what's your business here? Why are you making such a noise here? It's urgent. Please, forgive us for our rudeness. You are Mr. Osato, aren't you? Yes, I'm. So, this is what Miss Kyoko has told you. Yes, she said you might be able to help us. So, you want to know the exact purchase price for the warship's materials. And the labor costs budget of shipbuilding. We won't divulge the source. I'm sorry. I've decided not to have anything to do with the military. Wait up, Mr. Osato! The hopes are dashed. But there's nothing else we can do. In any case, we must convince him. Mr. Osato! What do you want? Sir, please help us! Sir, I've heard that you've been opposed to the redundant munitions industries and cut off from Ozaki's Shipbuilding Company, that's why ... That's why I ended up like this? I fought to death. That's why I know how terrible this country's military is. It will start the war. What did you say? After they have finished building that huge and magnificent warship it would cause many unnecessary misunderstandings if we let them do whatever they want. You know how this will end, don't you? These things have nothing to do with me. I'm heading out. Morning. (6 days until the final decision-making meeting) Morning. (6 days until the decision-making meeting) Whare's Mr. Osato? (6 days until the decision-making meeting) (6 days until the decision-making meeting) You two again? (6 days until the decision-making meeting) You two again? Why are you two so stubborn? He insists and doesn't want to see you. I advise you to give up. Please allow us to wait here. Give us a break. You look crueler. It's just a waste of time. I'm off work first. Thank you for your hard work. I'm off work first. Thank you for your hard work. We're going to close soon. Major Kai ... let's go back to Tokyo and think of something else. Just wait a little bit more. If it goes on like this every day it'll be too late. It's a shame. Let me in! Kyoko? I got here because I was so restless. I feel like I might be a pain in the ass, I hope I didn't cause you any trouble. Sensei一 Thank you. Having you is a million reinforcements. My name is Ozaki Kyoko. Please help me inform Mr. Osato that I'm here. I was so surprised by your presence. I knew you won't leave if you haven't had a talk with me. I'm so sorry. It's huge. Is it a warship? Yes, it is. Why did the accountant like you draw this blueprint? And it's a sketch, not a copy. Did you draw this? There's only one purpose. All I want to know is how much this ship really costs. Just for that? Yes. There are also constructs calculations. It's a prism dispersion curve. You even drew the hull's distribution weight. The buoyancy under the maximum waterline is also being reflected. Where did you learn how to build a ship? By February of this year I'm still a math student at Imperial University. No way. It's true. I just started learning to build a ship. You drew this blueprint. You are awesome. If that's the case he might be able to do what you said. He can change this country. I've always had a dream. Please tell me. If Japan wants to dominate the world we can't use warships, we should use merchant ships. In other words, to conquer the world with trade and economy. l got what you want to do. Let me give you a hand. I'm sorry to trouble you. This is rented as a warehouse. No one usually comes. The destroyer (the warship's name) alone has so many accounts. We finally got it! But I didn’t expect that there would be so many. While I was still working with Ozaki's Shipbuilding Company I had been received orders for various warships. It was requested by navy. A copy of the daily work and delivery desk. This ship took 600 days from the start to the completion. Let's not talk about the material's cost. Take a look at the labor cost budget. Labor costs? It costs so much to build a warship. I think that warship will cost dozens of times as much as this. No, it would be hundreds of times. There's no time to talk. Quickly apply this data to Hirayama's design. Even if you are a genius using these to calculate the cost budget of Hirayama's design it's going to take another week. So fast. I think we'll be here for two or three days. No need to worry. I've already made a report to Lieutenant General Nagano. Actually, they said the estimate cost budget of Hirayama's warship design is 89 million. That's bullshit, how could it be that cheap? As expected. My mission is to expose this apparently falsified shipbuilding offer. So ... You have to figure out how much this warship really costs, don't you? However, even if this plan is approved it should also cause a lot of damage to the Ozaki Shipbuilding Company. How exactly do you do to balance the account funds? I guess that's what they're doing. They're doing the placing. What's that mean? Yeah, that's what I have done all the time. For example, while ordering warships, you should order a few cruisers at a high price. So, the ship losses are immediately covered. So, Navy and Ozaki Shipbuilding Company will be having a closer relationship. More new orders will be received later. Is my father really doing this kind of thing? Maybe it's a little harsh for you. In this way, Ozaki's shipyard grew stronger. Excuse me, I have a telegram for Lieutenant Tanaka. Telegram for me? Thanks. It's from Lieutenant General Nagano. Major Kai. What's wrong? What's it say? It's about the final decision-making meeting. The date of the meeting has been changed. 11 a.m. tomorrow? It's not the deal! Eleven o'clock in the morning. What are we gonna do about that? It will be too late. In less than 14 hours. It was supposed to be next week. But why is it suddenly changed? The enemy is disturbed by our actions and trying to kill us first. Which means we're doing the right thing! Sucks! What's Lieutenant General Nagano doing? It's absolutely impossible to accomplish such a large amount of work in 14 hours. Not only that, but we also have to be back in Tokyo by 11 o'clock tomorrow. We have to catch the night train tonight. We're already out of ideas. How could this happen? His efforts so far ... it will be gone down the drain, won't it? Mr. Osato, what time is the last train to Tokyo? 10:40 p.m. There is one more hour. Even if you're a math genius, you just can't. You have already driven into a corner. I have an idea. We don't have to calculate the whole thing. Mr. Osato! The total amount of iron used by the previous warships and all the cost data. Do you have it? That data ... just look at the last page of the ledger. But what's the use of knowing that? It works out as I expected. What's he doing? I have no idea. This chart requires a second-order differential equation at most. Which means ... That's so fast. But what is it? Do you have scissors? Here is. Wait, what are you doing? Major Kai, this is ... What are you doing? Stop it! Based on this blueprint we can calculate the total amount of iron that Hirayama's design used. Only the total amount of iron used? What about all the other materials and the labor costs? All you have to do is know the total amount of iron you used. Can this alone calculate the cost of production? Let me explain this coordinate chart. (13 hours until the final decision-making meeting) Wait a minute. (13 hours until the final decision-making meeting) (13 hours until the final decision-making meeting) I'm glad I made it. (13 hours until the final decision-making meeting) I'm glad I made it. You haven't eaten since morning, have you? You can't fight a war with an empty stomach. Take this and eat it on the train. Thank you so much. Without your help there's no way we can make such progress this far. I put a bet on you. That's a bit much, Mr. Osato. Please, use your math to make this country a better place. If you don't, I won't forgive you. The function is done setting up. Is it finally done? Well, there's a little more to it. It's almost the 38th. I'm half done. That's fast. Well, I'm a businessman's daughter. Faster! There's no time. What's wrong? Ah, it's okay. I think I could really save the country with math. (7 hours before the final decision-making meeting) Tokyo! Here we are. Next is add up the numbers to find out the total amount of iron used on the ship. But it's only an hour. We're gonna have to give it a shot. Major Kai, let's go to the Admiralty first. Okay. Kyoko, thank you. I'll figure out the rest. Sensei! I believe in you. You're gonna make it. What are they doing? I don't know. But it looks like we better finish the meeting before they have done it. Time's up. Let's get the meeting started. (The final decision-making meeting of the new warship) In fact, the Army's budget appropriations are very competitive. (The final decision-making meeting of the new warship) In fact, the military's budget appropriations are very competitive. If the budget is too high it will be very difficult to negotiate with the Minister of Finance​. So, today's final decision I suggest we make a decision based on the most appropriate amount of cost. What do you think? I have no objection. Wait. I think it's necessary to discuss it again. The question is which would be more appropriate, aircraft carriers or warships? Both plans have their viability, it's a pretty big deal. Nagano ... your request only makes us think you're stalling. All right. That means everyone has agreed. First of all, we'll start with Fujioka's plan. You applied for a revision of the plan. It's the revised cost, isn't it? Yes. Try to lower the price. Based on the proposal we submitted last time, the cost price was 93 million and we have cut 2 million of it this time. It changes to 91 million. 2 million less? Don't mention it. It doesn't have much impact on the outcome of this discussion. How's it going? How much longer will it be? There is still seven left. One sheet takes one minute. It will take 10 minutes in total to finish it. 10 minutes? 10 minutes? 10 minutes is too long. I'll say it honestly, I think the estimated value of Hirayama's design for drainage is too low. If it costs 89 million to build that warship then I'd like you to present the detailed evidence. I just don't understand what's wrong with cheap offer. The most important thing for us now is to get the government to approve our plan. Which is to try to make the price of the plan's offer as low as possible. That's what I'm really thinking of right now. We are in trouble. They've already decided to adopt Hirayama's. Come on! Faster! The meeting's almost over. Nagano, would you please understand my difficulties? Ah, but ... Please look at me in my face. Minister, you go that far? The end has been decided. Well, considering the appropriateness of the cost Wait a minute. we'll adopt Hirayama's for the new warship to replace the old warship. Just a moment, please! What the hell are you doing? You don't have the right to intrupt the meeting! I'll buy some more time. You continue to finish the calculation. Got it. I can figure out the real cost budget of Hirayama's design. What did you say? What do you mean, real cost? You have to make it clear! I used the information I had. I have found that there is a correlation between the total amount of iron used and the cost of building warships. This coordinate chart can indicate the correlation between them. The total amount of iron used for torpedo boats and submarines are small. Which means to build the smaller ships are more complicated and the cost of construction per ton of iron will increase. It's the most expensive part. That's a submarine. That's why submarines are small but expensive. On the contrary, warships use a large amount of iron. But warships are easier to manufacture. And the construction costs per ton of iron can also be reduced. In this way, we can know from the coordinate chart. The cost of making submarines are the highest when the amount of iron is around 1,500 tons. What are you talking about? Here's the function formula to represent this coordinate chart. Through this formula as long as we know the total amount of iron used by a ship we can calculate the actual cost budget of that ship. If we substitute the total amount of iron used in Hirayama's design into this formula we'll know the actual cost budget of the ship一 It's so absurd. What did you just say? I said it was absurd. If there were a correlation between total iron consumption and cost budget it's impossible to work it out without the data of several ships. Of course, the formula is based on a large number of data. Ah, a new Major accountant. Don't you think what you're saying is weird? According to what I heard you have no access to the Military Aircraft and haven't read any materials. Didn't you make it impossible for me to read the data? Don't look for any excuse that doesn't make sense. May I ask? You have no access to the Military Aircraft then, where did you get a lot of data? Forgive me, I can't answer that. Just as I expected. So, this chart and the formula is all bullshit. You said my formula is bullshit? At first glance, his formula seems credible. And then put in the appropriate numbers to figure out the ridiculous amount. And claim it's the real cost budget. We don't have to waste any more valuable time dealing with such a crook. Crook? You just called him a crook? Well. If I can prove the correctness of this formula you'd believe it, wouldn't you? How do you prove it? Just pick a random existing warship. And tell me the total amount of iron it used. I can use this formula to calculate the correct cost budget of that ship. If you couldn't figure it out, you're done. By then, don't kill yourself. - Takato! - Yes? Go to the ship's headquarters and get the ship's database. So, calculate how much it costs to build this Chidori boat. Okay. The total amount of iron used is 400 tons. 400 tons. That's 2.22 million. How can it be possible? Awesome! I don't think he knows the cost budget of that boat construction plan but it's perfectly calculated. Which means it proves the correctness of the formula. It could be a blind cat running into a dead rat. Okay, next is ... Cruiser Myoko. Yes. 9,700 tons. 9,700 tons. It's 28.16 million. Good! So, how much does Hirayama's design cost? It seems it costs 89 million. I leave it to you. 175.64 million. It's the correct cost budget of Hirayama's design. It's almost double the amount of the cost budget submitted. This is a serious matter. Lying about a much lower estimate than the actual cost. It's a violation of this final decision meeting. We will not tolerate such conduct. Lieutenant General Hirayama. Can you explain to us why the cost is so much lower than the actual one? The mystery of super low price do you have a secret agreement with Ozaki Shipbuilding Company? A secret agreement? Build cheap warships and order cruisers at a high price in return. What did you say? It's dangerous to talk like that way. Your untruthful drivel. It's an insult to the senior officer. You should be sent to a military court. Major Kai is not the kind of fool who would make a joke at a defense conference. He's not like you. What did you say? Stop it! Everybody, please calm down. His remarks are not appropriate for this occasion, so... No, Minister ... we have every reason to doubt the existence of a private agreement. Lieutenant General Nagano! By this time ... even a little doubt should be thoroughly discussed. The actual cost budget of Hirayama's design is much higher than the estimated amount. It's a problem in itself. At the same time, general Hirayama himself doesn't give a clear answer. If that's the case it makes anybody wondering that there's an undercover operation. This has to be clear, right, Major Kai? As you say. How dare you say that, asshole? If you don't give me any proof, I won't let you go. But we indeed ordered some cruisers from Ozaki Shipbuilding Company. I didn't know that. Let me interrupt. What it is? Why did you conclude it was Ozaki Shipbuilding Company? Did you get the information from someone that related to Ozaki family? Who would it be? Is it the woman that mentioned in those anonymous letters? You're still hooking up. No, we're not dating. How could you believe what you hear from a woman on the bed? On the bed? Don't say such dirty words. The one who wrote those slanderous words was you, right? What are you talking about? Are you trying to frame me? Does it mean that a senior officer's subordinate isn't in a relationship with a woman? What are you trying to say? Do you have any secrets, Yamamoto? But, don't you have a second wife at Fukagawa? I can't believe you're talking something like that here. I heard you knelt down after your wife found out. Did you get down on your knees? Why don't you get down on your knees? Stop it! We're talking about warships right now. Back to the subject. We must verify the cost budget of Hirayama's design. It's not a false number. It's just based on speculation. Then again, it's ridiculous that the navy's plan is swayed by such formula. That formula is all farce. I don't agree with it. Numbers never tell a lie. Numbers are real justice. General Hirayama must have known it already. I think he already knew it's going to cost nearly 200 million. And he changed it into a fictitious number. He lacks honesty as a shipwright. So, his construction plan is unreasonable. Don't insult Lieutenant General Hirayama! He's well aware of the irregularities but he's still colluding with private companies to tamper with budgets. It'll eventually bring huge damage to the Department of Treasury. It's a plan to trample on justice. It's a manifest breach of virtue. What's wrong with that? I said, what's wrong with that? Did you lose face? It's all about protecting the country. To keep Japan alive, 100 million, 200 million is nothing. 100 million or 200 million? It's a tax that the people pay with sweat and blood. Even a penny is not allowed to be treated at will. If there were no country, there would be no citizen. Fujioka's project plan won't protect the country. Besides, you have no right to punish me. Even without power, it's my duty to find out the truth. The truth? That sort of thing doesn't mean anything. You're just judging things with your superficial sense of justice. But it doesn't shake the real world. Because there is pure justice. Indeed, I rely on the assistance of Ozaki Shipbuilding Company. And offer a much lower cost budget than the actual one. So, you admit that you did cheating, don't you? If I didn't we wouldn't be able to hold the secret of the construction of a super huge warship. Secret? If Japan were said to spend 200 million to build a new warship how would the rest of the world react to this information? No doubt they'll analyze the cost budget. Predict the size and performance of our warship. And then, to fight against us they're going to build a super bigger warship. That means to confuse the enemy the first step is to convince us. The construction cost budget must be made public to confuse the enemy? Yes, that's the point. To surprise the enemy let them fall into panic and lose the will to fight in the war. We have to build a super huge warship in great secrecy. That's a hell of a plan. Fantastic! I can't believe you think of it this far. Minister, please understand us. This fake estimated cost budget is for the good of the country. Please understand. I get it. I totally get it. The idea of using the open public warships cost to control the enemy. Well, the new warship construction plan will adopt Lieutenant General Hirayama's design. No objections, right? I'd love to accept it. Good! That's settled. I really can't reconcile myself. I was so desperate to expose the fake cost budget. It doesn't make any sense. Will this super huge warship be built in the end? Tanaka! Yes! Bring me all the pieces of my drawings. Yes! This is the plan figure and profile of the ship I designed. Why do you have this? I drew it based on Nagato's general deck map to speculate on your ship design. How can a layman like you can draw this blueprint in a few days. Who the hell are you? What are you guys doing, the meeting is already over. It's not over yet! There are major flaws in Lieutenant General Hirayama's design. What are you talking about? How big the high wave can your ship handle? High wave? In terms of the size of the typhoons that occur ten times a year predicting wind speeds of 40 meters per second is generally no problem. But in the case of low pressure the waves from all directions converge at once. In this case ... The wave height may develop beyond expectations. So, what the hell are you going to say? Be quiet, please! And what's more? If the typhoon develops to a speed of 50 meters per second the composite waves can be up to 30 meters high. The size of a typhoon that happens twice a year. Then there will be a huge wave that engulfs this ship. However, the design of this proposal has a huge impact on this level. There may be a lack of predictability in the shear force generated by the hull. What's the shear force? It's a force that causes the hull to snap out of shape. Although in this scheme the ship was covered with thick armor in the center but because of this weight distribution the bow and stern will be vulnerable. When the huge waves hit this spot the ship will crack and soak in water. The worst-case scenario the ship will sink. If that were to happen, it would be a disaster since the navy was founded. Even though we want to resist the waves of more than 30 meters it's impossible to avoid low performance. If we just focus on assuming a wave that happens once in hundreds of times no warships can be built. Whether it's hundreds or thousands of times it's the designer's responsibility to prepare for it. In fact, I've predicted a 30-meter composite wave to derive the formula for the optimal solution between the shear force and the equilibrium distribution of weight. Looks like I lost. Minister, please withdraw my design. You don't have to. I've missed a major flaw. As a shipwright, my proposal makes me ashamed. It's a stain on my life. If you withdraw my design, it will save my last pride. Then I'll take my leave. You did it. You have mastered the best solution formula. Hirayama's design won't be adapted. I think so. So, Hirayama's design was withdrawn. The new warship construction plan adopts the aircraft carrier proposed by Fujioka. What would Kai think if he knew the truth? It feels he's a bit stubborn. But it's also evidence that he's meticulous on numbers. I'm more interested in his math calculation skills than his personality. And ... if he revealed that Hirayama made up the total of cost budget Hirayama's warship design will be withdrawn. And we'll get a new large aircraft carrier. If our goal is to make an early peace of the war against US and UK then the first battle is important. I have a plan that will catch them off guard. Aren't you an anti-war activist? Of course, it would be better if we didn't start a war. But if war is inevitable we'll organize a task force unit to operate the new aircraft carrier as a flagship. and we'll destroy US flagship fleet at the start of the war with aircraft. Actually, we've got information about the new strongholds in the Pacific. Where is it? Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. If you knock this place down and shut down the Panama Canal the control of the Pacific Ocean must be in our hands. What's wrong? Nothing. I'm wondering if you were still a soldier. (A month later) You're finally here. What's the matter? I want you to see this. This is a 20-to-1 model. Isn't it beautiful? I didn't call you here for anything else. I want you to tell me the formula. How could I possibly tell you If I did that ... We'll be able to complete the design of this ship. Then, we can overturn the decision. That's what you truly think. What's with that nonsense? I've worked so hard to ruin your plan. Bringing it back to life is what I wanted? Kai, be honest. You have to make this ship. You have created this ship yourself. Well, you should be tempted to see this ship finished. No, I shouldn't. This ship should never have been built. Having the strongest warship will surely lead Japan to war. Don't make it incite the nation to war. A magnificent, elegant ship that everyone is proud of. It's just a curse for this country. Lieutenant General Hirayama! You must never create such a monster like this. Whether we build this ship or not this country is bound to go to war. The Eastern Army (Kanto Army) invaded China. Establishing a Pseudo Manchukuo (Japan puppet state). Withdrew from the League of Nations. The world's hatred of Japan is growing. When we forced to the brink and people had to acquiesce in the choice of war. Japanese people are still immersed in the victory of the Russo-Japanese War. This ship can't control the current situation. We have to take the lead. We? People like you and me. You and I just think of we're on the same wavelength. That's why I'm telling you this. If we made war with US Japan would definitely lose. That's what you think, isn't it? I think so, too. The overwhelming gap in national power is unimaginable. Japanese people don't know how to get defeated. No matter how dire the situation maybe Japanese people will fight to the last man. If that were the case, this country would be truly destroyed. But, then ... if there were a huge and magnificent warship that symbolized Japan What do you think? When it sinks can that sense of despair wake up this country? Does that mean you do it on purpose? Because this warship is beautiful and huge people believe it will never sink. Make people have high expectations and drive people go crazy. And it goes to a terrible end. This is the mission given to this warship. I want to build a warship that Japan can rely on. Rely on? Before this country is destroyed this warship is going to sink into the sea as a national perch. So, I gave this warship a very appropriate name. The name of this warship is Yamato (One of the another name of Japan). Yamato. Could you tell me the formula now? (Nine years later Two months after Japan attacked Pearl Harbor) Present arms! Why are you in tears? I ... From the hull of that warship, I can see the epitome of Japan. Yes, that's such a great warship. It's a symbol of The Great Japanese Empire. Translation: neet21
