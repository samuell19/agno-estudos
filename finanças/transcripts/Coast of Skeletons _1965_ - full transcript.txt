[MUSIC PLAYING] [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] -Well, I'm, uh, well, I'm sorry I missed the party, sir. [LAUGHING] -Uh, thank-- Thank-- Thank you, very much, sir. -Oh, it's nice of you to drop in Hamilton. -Yes. Oh, yes! Oh, there's a rhino making towards the waterhole, sir. He's bound to fall in the pit. You'll never stop him, sir! -No, but I can try to divert him. Tom, get the engine started. [RHINO BELLOWING] -OK, Tom. Well, that was a near thing for poor old Rodney Rhino. -Well, at least that's one rhino that won't finish up as a stimulant for some jaded oriental businessman. -Yes, there's be black flags in Hong Kong tonight. Oh! I nearly forgot, sir. -All right, [INAUDIBLE] see them back at the camp. -I would imagine it's from the high commissioner's office. That is the new minister for the entire area. Extremely new! Uh, orders, huh? -Well, yes. The final one for us, I'm afraid. Order of the boot. -Excuse me, sir. Aren't you Mr. Sanders? -Yes, I am. -I'm from "The Daily News". I'd like to congratulate you on your award of being vested here this morning. -Uh, thank you, very much. -Uh, may I ask, sir, do you think your dismissal from Ghandra was fair? -I'd rather not comment on that. -And what are your plans? -My major plans? Well, I'm going to Scotland to fish. -And after that? Retirement perhaps? -Hardly. I'll look for another job, I suppose. -In Africa? Preferably. -Then you do want to go back? -I'd always want to go back to Africa. -Thank you. -Excellent credentials. -Thank you, Mr. Spyker. -As I expected, you fill the bill perfectly. Are the conditions acceptable? -Yes, I think so. Um, I'd like to know more about this man, though. -AJ Magnus. He's quite a personality. Comes from Texas, I believe. Started [INAUDIBLE], respected for gold in New Guinea, and finally moved to Africa. This is where he operates. Here. -The Southwest coast of Africa. -Base of the South Atlantic Dredging Company. Magnus' Company. -Dredging for what, Mr. Spyker? -Diamonds. -Offshore diamonds? -Magnus has a concession along this strip of coast. The Coast of Skeletons. He uses a dredger. -I've heard of diamond dredging. How successful is it? -The answer's in the balance sheets. Dull things, Mr. Sanders, but necessary when a million pound project is at stake, and a large insurance coverage. -Insurance? -This office acts for Western Marine Insurance. AJ Magnus carries considerable cover with us, as he did in his first venture. -Also diamond dredging? -Yes. Ended disastrously. The dredger foundered and sank in deep water. Lost him lots. -To the insurance company? -Naturally. -Well, how does Magnus stand now? I mean with you people? -Delicately, Mr. Sanders. We paid his claims in full. And once Magnus found fresh capital, and fitted out a new dredger at the Cape, then he bought an escort ship, "The Tigress". Mr. Magnuss always was free with other people's money. -Well, what exactly do you want me to do in Africa? -First, protect my client's interests. Second, tighten security on the site. And third, find out what happened to that first dredger. -Well, as a security officer, I'll need some sort of cooperation from him. How does he feel about having me out there? -We're not deeply concerned about Magnus' feelings. In order to get insurance cover, he had to accept our terms. You are one of them. -Who's this Cornelius Van Houten? -Was, Mr. Sanders. Van Houten is no longer with us. He was Magnus' partner before the disaster. I'm afraid the old boy had neither Magnus' nerve, nor his collateral. And the insurance was a Magnus' name only. Faced with bankruptcy, he shot himself. -I see. -It may pay you to look up Van Houten's son, Piet, when you get out there. He knew a lot about the dredger. -Well, I can save time and shoe leather on that. Tom Hamilton happens to be in Johannesburg right now. -Hamilton? -My former assistant in Ghandra. I'd like to have him with me on this. -Hm, I think our budget could stand it. May I say, how relieved we are to have you watching our interests. -I'm interested, too, Mr. Spyker. Especially in Magnus, when do I get to see him? -That's already been arranged. He should be going on board "The Tigress" this evening. 6 o'clock, Top O'road Docks. Do give him my best regards. -Right, I will. Bye. -And where do you think you're going? -I'm looking for AJ Magnus. -He ain't here. -Well, I'll wait. -Not here you won't. No strangers allowed. -Where's your captain? -He's below, and the gangway's right behind you, mister. Use it. -Make me. -You don't have to [INAUDIBLE] [WHISTLES] Hey, Finn! [YELLING] [SPLASH] -Better fish your friend out. -Emil can swim. Can you? -That's enough, Finn. Stop it. Get him below. [INAUDIBLE] nothing. Get to your quarters. I'm Captain Von Koltze. Who the devil are you? -My name's Sanders. You've got a rough lot on this ship, captain. -I run this ship, I didn't choose the crew. Did you say Sanders? -That's right. I was told I'd find AJ Magnus here. -I'm afraid you won't. But he left a message for you, he asked you to join him tonight at, uh, 9 o'clock at the Dolphin Club. -I see. -A scratch crew. You may not think so, Mr. Sanders, but, uh, I once had a German Navy command. I could make some amends by giving you a drink. -Thanks, but I rather think I'd better go get cleaned up and changed. 9 o'clock, you said? -Yes, 9 o'clock at the, uh, Dolphin Club on the river. I'll be there. -By the way, who's Seton? Your [INAUDIBLE]? -Carlo? [LAUGHS] Thank heavens he's not one of my crew. He's Magnus' right hand man. Personally, I would rather trust a rattlesnake. -Well, there's no accounting for taste. I'll see you later. -All right. -So here's to your prospect, and prospecting! -What do you think of prospects, sir? -At [INAUDIBLE]? Excellent. Wonderful! You know, Sanders, I got a real nose for gold. -I thought it was diamonds you were after. -Hey, it is. And they're all right, but gold! It's something else. Do you have a tingling in your fingertips? Do you ever have a fever? -About seven different varieties, but never, ever gold. -When I was five years old, I was convinced there was gold in my back yard. I went out and I got me a little bucket and a shovel, and I started to dig. It took me 15 years to find out how wrong I was. Wasn't gold at all. It was oil. -Mr. Magnus, I'd like to ask you a question. -Go right ahead, and call me AJ. -Where does Seton fit in? -Carlo? He's been with me for a good many years. On Coast, it's Carlo that told me about the trouble we had. Are you really sore at Carlo? -No, I've an idea that he's the one that's feeling pretty sore. --[CHUCKLES] Yeah, you gave him quite a beating, I understand. It's all right. He's had it coming for a long time. What's his job with you? -Security, I suppose you'd call it. My security. -Well, just so long as he keeps to his own beat. -He's all right. Give him a little raw meat every now and then, he'll eat out of your hand. And what do you think of Von Koltze? -Seems a good type. But he puzzles me. He tells me he's ex-German Navy. -He is. War hero and all that stuff. I think that's part of his trouble, he never quite got over it. Can't seem to settle down. Got married not too long ago to a girl and she's gonna settle him all right. One way or another, you draw your own conclusions. Here she comes now. -Hello. -Well, glad you could make it, Helga. -Elizabeth, I hope you'll enjoy yourself. -I'm sure I will. Why, uh, Mrs. Von Koltze, I'd like to have you meet Harry Sanders. -How do you do? -Harry's a man they assigned to our ship to see that now one walks off with the illicit diamonds in their shoes, or anywhere else. -So you are coming with us to Africa? -We're all going together. And I think you're gonna find this is not too bad of an assignment. I'd like to have you meet Captain Von Koltze's sister, Helga. -How do you do? HARRY SANDERS: How do you do? -Of course, I've heard about you, Mr. Sanders. -Hm. Well, let's all sit down and have a drink. AJ MAGNUS: Well, we're all one big, happy family. All we need now is Janny Von Koltze. -No, he's got his hands full with that crew of his. AJ MAGNUS: Well, dredger crews aren't exactly picked for their personalities, Sanders. They're very touchy about strangers. -Good night. -Good night. What's your name? -Singer, sir. Charlie Singer. -Well, the bag is ship-shape. How did you get into this crew of misfits, Singer? -I just signed on, sir. -Glad to have got one abled seaman aboard. -Oh, I've been at sea for 25 years. -Ever been to South Africa before? -I think we've both been to South Africa before, Captain. -What's the word you'd give AJ Magnus? Impressive? -How about flamboyant? -Well, he certainly seems to have made an impression on your sister-in-law. -Are you glad to be going back to Africa? -That's my main reason for taking this job. -I know. Two years ago I feel in love with Africa. -As a tourist? -Oh, certainly not. I'll have you know that my photographs have appeared in the National Geographical magazine. -Tell me, are you the official photographer on this expedition? -No, just going along for the ride. Actually, I'm on a long holiday. But this chance is just too good to miss. -Here they are. -This man dances divinely. -Had to learn to be fast on my feet where I come from to dodge bill collectors. How're you making out, Sanders? If you smile just right, she may shoot ya. With a camera, I mean. [LAUGHING] -Here's Von Koltze. Welcome, Captain. -Sorry to be so late. -Nah, just in time. Waiter! Bring us some champagne! -Miss me darling? [SPEAKING GERMAN] -Hello, Helga. You look wonderful. -My favorite big brother. -AJ, tell him. -Tell me what? -Oh, we've had a little change in plans. You'll be leaving tomorrow with your shake down crew. -What's new about that? -I won't be leaving for about three days. I'll fly out then, and take Carlo, and Helga, and Elizabeth with me. Sanders will come along a couple of days after that. -Elizabeth is sailing with me in "The Tigress". -Janny, you know I've been dreading the [INAUDIBLE]. All that time on that old tub. -I know, darling. I know she's not a luxury liner, but I think she will be comfortable enough. -And you know I always get seasick. I want to fly! -But you always told me you don't like flying. -Don't you see? It would be so much better all around. And I could be waiting for you in [INAUDIBLE], at the other end. -Sanders, I hope you don't mind waiting 'til the end of the week. I believe you said you had some business you wanted to get cleared up here anyway. -I can get away by then. -Good. Well, get [INAUDIBLE] some dinner. Anything you want, you just ask for it. -The only thing I want is my wife to sail with me to [INAUDIBLE]. -I'm flying with the others. -Dance? -Yes, love to. -How about you, Elizabeth? Like to dance? -Mm-hm. Do you mind? -I don't mind. As long as you are happy. -One, big, happy family. At least you and I are good together. -The thought was very much in my mind. -Mr. Sanders. I'm Hajo Peterson. Mr. Magnus asked me to meet you. His plane's over on the private strip. -That's nice of Mr. Magnus. Let's get through the formalities shall we? -Tired Mr. Sanders? -No, quite the reverse. Too glad to be back. -Do you know this part of Africa? -No, my territory was further north. -Fabulous coastline, it's worth a look. Hundreds of miles of it, all the way up to Angola. The Coast of Skeletons. Can even see the bones down there. -Stranded ships? -Yeah. Most of them torpedoed during the war. The sea [INAUDIBLE] back a [INAUDIBLE] every year, leaving them high and dry. -That's a god-forsaken spot, all right. -Yeah, a man could be lost down there for weeks. If he lost it that long. -There's one. -She's a beauty. I've seen [INAUDIBLE] before, but never a complete ship. -Might be worth a closer look, sometime. -Not in my plane, friend. -You fly? -Yes, I used to fly one of these in Ghandra. We had a flying club in up there. -How'd you like to take this home? -Fine! -Uh, you got her. -Some girl. -Nice to come home to. -You bet! -I'll swap chauffeurs with ya. -No, not a chance. I'll see you later. Thanks very much for the trip. -Pleasure's all mine. -Hello. -Hello, there. -Are you going to hold that bag all day long? -Ah, it's good to see you, Helga. -It's good to see you, sir. I've got lots to show you. How about a cheap cook's tour? -I've had one, thanks. -Ours are different. -So are your guides. All right, I'll put myself in your hands. -Doesn't this all scare you? -Well, I'll hold tight. -I'll drive like a mouse. -You know, Carlo, I rather fancied her myself. -Well, stick around. You never know your luck. -Straight out of the Rhine Valley. -Well, it was a German Colony, you know. -Welcome, Sanders. What do you think of this? -Well, Baron Magnus got himself a pretty good check. -Are you trying to go one better than Texas? -I'm afraid nothing goes better than Texas. But seriously, I'm glad you could make it. Did it surprise ya? -Nothing surprises me in this setting. -Go on, I'll show you the rest of this ranch. -A bit early to be changing for dinner, isn't it? -I got a headache, I've been lying down. -You really like it hear, don't you? -Well, who wouldn't? If I had my way, I'd never go. -That sort of life wouldn't suit Janny. -No, I don't expect it would, but it suits me. I'm so tired of being a wife waiting for a ship to come home. As a matter of fact, AJ has invited me to stay here as long as I want. -On his conditions? -No. On my conditions. Which, for your information, is my business and not yours. But if you want to tell Janny, you may. -Better tell him yourself, Elizabeth. You see, I'm only his sister. You're his wife. -Ay, steady on course. -At this rate, we'll pick up Cape Constance around midnight. It's a piece of cake, sir. -[INAUDIBLE] in 48 hours. -Your wife will be pleased to see you, sir? I'm not a married man, myself. But I hear it, uh, can come out quite expensive. -What are you getting at, Singer? -At our age, sir, wives are a bit of a luxury. Even a man like you, sir. Captain of a submarine, decorated for bravery, a wartime hero. In peacetime, these things don't count much for the ladies, sir. -You seem to know a hell of a lot about me. -I made it my business to find out, sir. -Why? -I had good reason. That's why I signed on. -Well, now let's have it. There's been nothing since veiled hints since we left the Port of Lund. What's this all about, huh? -I was waiting for the chance to tell you, sir. But I had to make sure, first, that you'd be interested. -Interested in what? -In making both of us a fortune. -It's a beauty, believe me. She goes like a bump. Magnus says you're too use it while you're here. -I'm touched. -He's not such a bad chap, you know. Rather an odd guy, but a nice bloke to work for. -Would Van Houten's son agree with you? -Piet? I wouldn't take any notice of what he says. -Why not? He got to work for Magnus, didn't he? -He did. Until his old man shot himself. Piet was always rather highly strung, then he went, well-- -Well, I'd rather like to meet him, do you know where he can found? -I've no idea. Honest. I really can't help you, Mr. Sanders. -Can't? Or won't? [CAR REVVING] -You're meeting up [INAUDIBLE] aren't you? Want a lift? -Thanks, but I've got this. Compliments of Mr. Magnus. -Well, we are going up in the world. -Anyway, there's no room for three of us in that midget of yours. -No problem. I'll take this baby into town for you. Or better still, you take this one, I'll drive with Helga. -Oh, no, you take this one. -Race you! -Miss Magnus, he's dead. Go back to the car. Go on, go back. The steering had failed. Track rod was broken. Might be hard to prove, but I'll swear it had been cut through. Helga? Helga! -It was meant for you. -I'll have to phone the house, and the police. -Don't you see it was meant for you? -Yeah, I know. -Hello, Louis, this is Magnus. Has Carlo showed up around there? Go down to the dredge, see if you can find him. I know you're busy, so am I! But you get down there and find him, and have him call me right away! -I just heard about that nice Peterson boy, is it true? -Yes, it is. Killed himself. Went over the cliff in the car. Police are screaming about it. -Police? -Yes, Sanders called. When they got back to the car it was on fire. Must have started when he went out to call. -That's odd. -That's what the police captain said. Sanders had told them that the car had been fixed to where it would've deliberately crashed. The fire destroyed any evidence they might've found. Where the devil is Carlo. -What do you want him for? -Because he usually knows all the answers. [PHONE RINGS] -Hello? Carlo! It's you, Louis. I thought I told you to go down to the dredge and see if you could find Carlo. Well, you find him. I don't care where you have him, call me. -I'm sorry you're [INAUDIBLE] -Peterson, he was speed crazy. He was a very nice fellow. -Elizabeth, I've got a lot on my mind right now. Would you excuse me for a little while? -I'm sorry. I know how you feel. I wish there was something I could do to help you. -Hm, [INAUDIBLE] Um, what about the police? -I don't think we can expect much help there, not without more proof. -Oh, it's, uh, it's my round, isn't it? Helga? -Yes, please. -I [INAUDIBLE], this is better than selling encyclopedias. -Is that what you were doing? -Yes, I was. Yes. I was riding around in a very unpleasant motor scooter, trying to keep my bowler hat on. Um, same again please. -Why don't you have those on me? I think I owe you something for all the chasing around I've cost you, Mr. Hamilton. -How-- How'd you know my name? -I saw you last week in Jo-burg. You didn't see me. -I'm terribly sorry, but I don't think we've met. -At that miserable hotel on Brown Lowe Street. Too bad you just missed me. I'm Piet Van Houten. -Good lord! -I don't know what you were after, but I strongly object to people asking questions about me in crummy little hotels in Jo-burg. They're the only ones I can afford. But I've still got my pride. I think we've better have a little chat with, um, with Mr. Sanders. -I've heard about him. Policeman isn't he? -No, not exactly. -I've nothing to say to Sanders. Just tell him to leave me alone. -Do you know who that was, sir? Piet Van Houten? -Excuse me. Look after Helga, will you? -Yeah, well, be careful, sir. -Stop. Keep away from me. -Piet Van Houten? Hasn't Mr. Hamilton told you who am I? -Let's talk shall we? First I'll take that gun. -Ask Magnus to give you one. He'll give you anything you want. Even a partnership. -That's what I want to talk about. Your father, and his association with Magnus. -My father is dead. What are you looking for, Sanders? -I'm looking for the truth. And you can help me. -Help you? Help one of Magnus' people? -Look, I'm not working for Magnus. -[CHUCKLES] That's a good lie. -Well, you better believe me, for your own sake. Ah, let's start again, shall we? -My father was a good man. He was also a very foolish man. He trusted AJ Magnus. -And he lost everything, didn't he? -Magnus destroyed him. Look, my father had a fine name. He raised the money for Magnus in this country, mortgaged himself to the armpits. But the diamonds didn't come up fast enough, and the dredger went down and stayed down. You know the rest. -Yeah. I'm sorry. -So am I. Magnus will be sorry, too. -Now, look, that's not the way, Van Houten. -There's no other way to handle a crook like Magnus. A bullet! And even that's too good for him! -Look, I'm staying at the [INAUDIBLE], if you like talking some more about it, let me know. I'll come. -[INAUDIBLE] with old Sanders. -Done any more thinking, sir? -Get that teaming, well ashore. -I've told you all I know. [INAUDIBLE] It back. You and me and the whole wide world are the only one's who'll know anything about it. -Get back to your work. -In the midst of our lives, we can do just what we wanted to. [INAUDIBLE] thought in it. -We make good time! -Janny! [SPEAKING GERMAN] -Good. -Africa seems to agree with you. -Home is a sailor. Welcome to Luderich, John. -Thank you, Mr. Magnus. -You look beautiful. -Oh, John. -Oh! Janny! I-- I've just fixed my hair! -You're a diamond. -Oh, please Janny. Must you stare at me? -It's been a long time since we were together like this. -Will you zip me up, please? -Oh, stop mauling me! Now I suppose I look terrible! -No, you don't. You look beautiful! -Believe me, I know this part of Africa. HARRY SANDERS: How about quality? Are they as good as diamonds mined from the earth? -Better, I think. Providing you can dredge up enough of them. Here's a sample one. -My goodness! Gonna make a marvelous engagement ring. -Oh, Tom, I didn't know you were going to get married. -With a diamond lie that, you wouldn't need to get married. -That looks a beauty to me. -There's plenty more where that came from. -Are you dredging again tomorrow? -No, Von Koltze will. I have to go to Jo-burg. To keep the stockholders happy, you know? HELGA VON KOLTZE: Daddy, call [INAUDIBLE] up to go with him. -And, um, suppose I will tell you that you can't go? -Then I will tell you that you're an old, mean husband and that I don't love you anymore. -If you love me darling, don't go. -But why shouldn't I? -Because I forbid it. -Really, Janny? -Yes. I do not want you flying all over the country with that man. -Stop making a complete fool of yourself. I'm just going, and that's it. -No, we will have this out. -Janny. -Here and now. -But you are hurting me. -I'm sorry, darling. What's his attraction Elizabeth? Money, huh? -I am just sick of always being alone and broke. Why shouldn't I have some fun for a change and see some life? All you have got to show for your life is a sea chest full of souvenirs. And an empty bank account. -Is that what you really think of me? All right, Elizabeth. If that's what you want, I'll get it for you. Just give me a chance. And I'll give you more money than you ever dreamt of. -Really Janny, I nearly took you seriously! Really, come and let us have some more champagne. Hm? -OK. -Don't be frightened. I want to talk to Sanders. -He's inside. -Get him out here. Nobody else. Just Sanders. I'll wait over there. Please. -All right, I'll-- I'll tell him. -Van Houten! -He said he'd wait over there. -Carlo. You'll have to try to shoot me. He hasn't got to defend himself. -Well, you did a good job of it. You've broken his neck. I want a work with you. -We can make it later. -We'll talk now. -Now let's get one thing straight. That Carlo was just doing his job. -Does his job include killing Van Houten? -No, of course it doesn't. He's big and strong, and he thinks with his muscles. -Young Piet Van Houten, had a grudge, and from what I know, I don't blame him. He was after you, and you had him put out of the way. -That's a lie. Look, why are you attacking me? -I've done everything in my power to cooperate with you. Even giving me a car that was a death trap. -You don't believe that. I've been accused of everything else in my life, but I've never been accused of murder. -And Carlo? What about him? -Like I said, he's big and he's strong. And he's not very smart. But he looks after my interests. -What are you looking after? -Me. Number one. Like always. Is that being honest enough? This business is no different than any other. Somebody's gonna win, somebody's gonna lose. Gotta look after yourself. -Is that the rule you applied to Cornelius Van Houten? -No. No, I didn't have to. He was a born loser. I didn't have to push him. And you don't have to push me either. I don't like being pressured. -That's too bad. But I've got a job to do, too. What happens from now on is up to you. -Good. Now we understand each other. -I'll look after my business, you look after yours. -You all clear now on what you're supposed to do? We work our way up the coast, taking [INAUDIBLE] and samples, and, uh, lining the [INAUDIBLE] just south of Diamond Head. -That's it exactly. You know, Janny, we oughta make a mint together. Your knowledge of the sea, and my general know-how. There's a fortune to be had in this ocean. -So, I'm told. And that's exactly what I'm looking for. A fortune. -Good. We're both looking for the same thing, then. -Hardly, Mr. Magnus. Perhaps I'm looking for something that I know I've lost. What you are looking for you may not deserve to find. -Well, you just bring us back a barge full of diamonds. We'll decide at that point who deserve what. I'll fly up the coast and meet ya at the rendezvous point. [INAUDIBLE] -Same to you. Whose idea was it to bring Helga along? -Mine. A few pictures might come in useful. -I understand. Just remember what I told you, Sanders. You look after your own business. -That's just what I intend to do. -Get those mooring ropes lashed. -Time's running out. You'll have to make a decision. -You had better be right about this. -I am. I stake my life on it. -We'll see. -All set? -All set. -Trust me? -Mm-hm. But I don't think Janny does. -I don't think Janny should. I don't think you should either. -But I told you I do. -We're miles off course. -Are we? -From, uh, Diamond Head, here, we go north, along the continental shelf. -That's off the [INAUDIBLE]. -It's got to be somewhere along there. -Along the watershed [INAUDIBLE]. -Where the hell do you think you're going, Von Koltze? -I think you can safely leave the navigation to me. -We're too far off shore. -The last time you went out was on the old [INAUDIBLE], wasn't it, Seton? -What's that got to do with it? -A matter of equipment. We are not limited any longer in short [INAUDIBLE]. -We've got the echo sounder now, Carlo. -And how do you expect to find diamonds with that? -By prospecting and testing the seabed. And now get out of here and leave the running of the ship to me! -I still say we're too far out. -And I say we're going further! Is that clear? -Don't make an enemy of him, captain. -He's making the pace. But if he makes any troubles, leave him to me. -And Magnus? --[INAUDIBLE] has begun, listen for the echoes. I'm going up to the wheelhouse. -An absolutely marvelous day. Oh, well it's, um, a matter of opinion, I suppose. Oh, yes, um, knit one, pearl one. -Huh, what did you say? -Oh, nothing, nothing, no. Just a little joke. You know. You been on this coast before? -Once. -Oh yes, with the first dredger? -Who said I was on any dredger? -No. Um, no, I was just curious, really. Diamond dredging can be absolutely fascinating, can't it? -If you say so. -Were you on Magnus' first dredger? -No, I wasn't. -I'm sorry, sorry. No, I just thought perhaps you might have been. You know. -I never worked for Magnus before. Get the point? -Oh, yes. Yes, I do, rather. -What an old-fashioned sailor you are. Oh, well, off you go. Just continuing my investigation, sir. -Your judo is getting a bit rusty, Tom. You were about two seconds slow getting off the mark. -Maybe I'll get some practice. -Now don't look for trouble. -No, sir, I won't. -Nice chap, really. If you like the type. -Carlo's a bit worried about the course we're making. I wonder why. -Oh, I'm sure Von Koltze knows what he's doing. -I hope so. Rustle up some drinks, old chap, will you? -Yes, sir, something tinkling in the long glass? -That'll be perfect. -Jolly good. -How're we doing? -No problems. Everything's all right, sir. -When do we stop dredging? -When our equipment gives us the green light. -Do you, uh, plot a course before hand? -Naturally. -Carlo seems to think there's something odd about it. -Carlo had better learn not to question my orders on the ship. That goes for you, too, Sanders. -It's my job to question everything. -Janny? -Helga, you came on board against my wishes. Now, please don't bother me. -If you have something on your mind, you know you can trust me. Harry and I are on your side, and you can trust him, too. -I don't trust anybody in this Magnus set up. -But you're working for him, yourself! -Not much longer. -Janny, don't do anything foolish. -Don't worry, my [INAUDIBLE]. Why don't you go and take some pretty pictures? Huh? [DREDGER PINGING] [PHONE RINGING] -Captain. -Captain, I'm getting an echo, something big. -[INAUDIBLE] and standby. Standby to anchor! -Your instruments seem to have done the trick, Captain. Have you found what you're looking for? -Diamonds, Mr. Sanders. Yes, I, uh, I believe there may be a field down there. -Do we start dredging now, Janny? -Not yet. I'll need to make further tests. SAILOR: Captain! -I suppose, we seems to have ground to a halt. Is this Tiffany's? -Von Koltze, the joke's over. I don't know what your echo sound picked up, we can't dredge here. We're in deep water. -I am going to take samples. Magnus didn't order anything like this. -Now away your anchor, and get the hell outta here! -I've had about enough of you. Get below! -You! -Pack it up, Carlo! -I could have handled him. -I'm sure you could. But you know he's right about one thing. You don't find diamonds where an echo sounded. Signal the men up at the dredger, so they can roll over, and eat with the crew. -You don't understand, Mr. Sanders. We are trapping the seabed. Now, may I get on with my job? -A fixed position, Captain. Will be easy when we get back without this bunch. -Get the sampling gear ready. -Eh? I don't get you. -We'll run the gear down. -Chances are she'll foul. -That's exactly what I want. Don't you see, Singer, this will give me an excuse to go down myself to make sure it's the right wreck. -No, I read you, Captain. -Good. -I'll make sure she fouls. You get your diving equipment on. -AJ, you're very quiet, what's wrong? -Bunch of armchair tycoons, back at Jo-burg. -The shareholders? What happened? -They got scared, and pulled the plug on me. -Does this change things? -For me. Don't you believe it. I've toured my way out of more bare bits, than you've had birthdays. Besides, Janny's probably dredged us up a whole bucket full of diamonds by this time. -Anyway, I don't worry about you, AJ. I'm sure you'll look out for yourself. -We found something down below there. -Captain! -Let me help you. -It's no use, we'll only break the line. We're gonna snags it. CAPTAIN VON KOLTZE: Don't pull on the line. I'm going down. [INAUDIBLE] -Harry! -I've got to find out what he's up to, Helga. --[INAUDIBLE] hold up to something. -Captain. -I said, hold it up. We won't be dredging here. -What'd you find down there, Captain? -Water. Water and fish, and a sandy seabed. What did you expect me to find there? -Nothing. Let's go fishing for diamonds. -What happened down there? -Sanders saved my life. -Janny! Is he all right? -Don't worry, we'll be back. He is quite a man. -Captain! for god's sake, did you find it? -No. -But the [INAUDIBLE] showed a [INAUDIBLE] great object down there. -A wreck, but not the one we were looking for. -Are you sure it's the wrong one? Did you look around properly? These hogs are hard to identify. -This one wasn't. -Very good. All right. -Ah, I must go diving more often. -Janny told me. Where is he? -In the cabin. -Helga, how would you like to take some underwater photographs here? -What kind of photographs? -There's a wreck down there. I think it's Magnus' first dredger. Tom, I want you to take Helga and the equipment over to our own dredger and dive from there. There's nobody on board, and the fewer people that know what we're up to, the better. -Yes, sir. -What kind of pictures do you want? -I want to know how that dredger went down. Get me anything you think might help. Then I want comparison shots of the same equipment on board our dredger. Tom, you can row her over. -Yes. Actually, I might be better navigating. -Come in. -You are, Janny? -Well, it takes a crisis to make a man see clearly through muddy water. Thanks for what you did down there. -Oh, forget it. -I don't intend to forget it. I set rather a high value on my old hide. -How much of that wreck were you able to see down there? -I saw enough. -Enough to identify it? -I think what's down there is Magnus' first dredger. Am I right? -Could be. I'll soon know, and I'll know why she went down. -No wonder Carlo didn't want me to work in this area. He must have towed her out to sea, and scattered her. -We'll have to have positive proof. -I'd like I take a look at that other dredger. -To make comparisons? -Well, you'll also need to soundings. The position was fixed on the chart. Singer marked it. -Why? -Why? Because we were looking for something else. -And now that we're on the same side, can you tell me of it? -It's men like us who have the dreams, isn't it, Sanders? Not those who have, uh, families, and homes, and a steady job. I suppose we are all tempted at some time or other, like me. I thought I saw a chance to get rich very quick. -Because of Elizabeth? -I know she's, uh, I know she's spoiled. She's extravagant. Call her anything you like, but, uh, I love her. And, uh, and I will do just about anything for her. I was looking for a ship called "The Callidan Star". I sank her off this coast almost 20 years ago. -During the war? -Yes. -What sort of a ship? -An armed merchant [INAUDIBLE]. She was carrying war supplies, and freights, and, although I didn't know it, a half million in gold bullion. -Gold bullion? On a freighter? -Stolen gold. The proceeds of the [INAUDIBLE] Train Robbery. There were six men in it. They smuggled the bar gold in ammunition boxes aboard "The Callidan Star". All six men were in the crew. When she sank, five of those went down with her. Only one man survived. Charlie Singer. -The man with the deep voice. -That was a deep secret that he hid for years. Then he found me, the one man who might remember exactly where she went down. -Exactly? After so long? -I remember the night where we were. "The Callidan Star" strayed from her convoy, and, uh, when I picked her off, she was in shallow water. -Over the continental shelf. -Yeah. Now, I can't pinpoint her exactly, but it must be somewhere around here. -Wait a minute, we're off the Skeleton Coast, aren't we? -Uh. -Let's go and have a look at it. How far would you say we are from the coast? Half a mile? -Less. What are you getting at, Sanders? -I know how this coast shifts and changes. It's notorious. -I buried "The Callidan Star" down there. She's somewhere on the shelf between here and Diamond Head. -Well, she can't be. The sea's left her. It's receded. The seabed is are those sand dunes over there. And there are the bones of a ship there. I've seen it. I've flown over it. My guess is that your "Callidan Star" is now about eight miles north of here, high and dry on the sand. -If you are right, there must be a function sitting there. Unless somebody has got to it by now. -Nah, it's no man's land, Janny. Too desolate for anyone to find that ship by chance. CAPTAIN VON KOLTZE: It's Magnus. He is going to land on the beach. The arrangement is to send the boat aboard the shore. -Before he gets back here, I'd like to have a chance to look over that other dredger. -You had better take the dingy. -I'll take the dredger's, but I sent Helga and Hamilton over in the other one. -I'm glad she's out of here. -I'll get back as soon as I can. -Fine. -Carlo. -Jump in the back, Elizabeth. -Not the girl, Mr. Magnus. Just you. -What's the matter? -I'll tell you on the way out. -All right. Wait here, Elizabeth. -But I don't want to wait here alone. -You're gonna have to. -AJ! Will you hurry back? -You in? -Yeah. -Well done. How'd you get on? -Wonderful! Got some great shots! I've even got some shots of the sea cocks! -Good. You go and get changed. -She's the same type. -Same type as what, sir? -The dredger I found underwater. Mind you, she was helled over, as if she'd turned turtle. -Well, all the way to the top, with all of those buckets. -Yeah. -Perhaps she turned over because somebody pulled the plug out on one side. -That's probably exactly what did happen. -Yes, but I get these brain waves sometimes. -Let's check the sea cock, see how they work. -That's for being a wise guy. -That's enough, Carlo. -Well, Captain, looks like you've been making a few discoveries on your own. -That's my business. -Then you'd better stand by for a takeover. It seems that you've found what we want. -What? Is it Elizabeth? -That's part of the takeover. -You rat! -Put him over on the dredger with the others. Soon as we're clear, then we'll send this boat on back to Luderich. CARLO: I'll need some help. -Singer, you go with him. SINGER: It's a deal then, Magnus? -You've got a deal, we'll look out for you. All my life, I've looked for the biggest dragon. Well, this is it. Get him out of here. -You're a fool, Singer. You can't cross these two men. -You're the fool, Captain. You've just chickened yourself out of half a million. -On this side, those two valves were wide open. -Sanders, it's Seton, he's got a gun! -Janny! What happened? -It's Magnus. He's going after the gold on "The Callidan Star". -How did he find our? -Singer. [METAL BANGING] -It's no good, sir, it won't move. -He must have opened the sea cocks of the other hold. If he has, we'll sink. -Well, I'm afraid we're in a bit of a spot, sir. Unless anybody's got a tin opener. -Watch out everyone, I'm gonna try and blow the lock off. -Any luck, sir? -No, it must be bolted on the outside. -There might be another way out. If one of us could get up there. That is an emergency hatch. It shouldn't be passed down. -Well, do you think I could try, sir? I spent my last leave on the Alps, and I rather fancied myself on the Matterhorn. It goes a ways up. I'll be right back. -Well, it's going to be a long road. -We'll head straight for Diamond Head. And we'll circle 'til we see the [INAUDIBLE]. Come on, cheer up! Cheer up! -AJ, why did we change our plans? Where are we going? -Don't you worry your pretty little head about it. We're heading for easy street. -She's leaking like a sieve. We are lucky to make it. He is making for [INAUDIBLE] Diamond Head. -Well, if we're going to go after him, we'd better take the motor boat. -And besides the wreck, will he risk landing on the desert? -He'd risk it, for half a million. -There's lots of places he could land. After that, the border's only 100 miles away. That's why we've gotta be quick. I've got a score to settle with Mr. Magnus. -We don't know for sure that Elizabeth is with him, Janny. -I know Magnus. Hamilton, how's that boat? -It's no good, they've emptied all the petrol away. -Damn! That boat could've saved us a long walk. -Are you all right, Tom? -Yes, yes, I'm fine, thanks. Just the wind, I think. Um, what're we gonna do, sir? -There's only one thing for it. The safest way is to follow the shoreline round Diamond Head. The quickest way is to cut straight across the desert. -Well, we have no other choice. -Don't worry, Janny. -I'm sorry, Helga, to drag you into this. But I'll get you out of it. -There she is! -Better be sure about this, Singer. -Oh, I know it, Mr. Magnus. -All right, we're going down. -I'm all right, Harry. -I say, I think this coast is right for a spot of development, don't you? -Down here. [INAUDIBLE] Here's the cargo. -What's this? -What's it? That's [INAUDIBLE] my money. -What's this? 21 carat? -[INAUDIBLE] We've found it! We've found it! -AJ, when are we going back to the ship? -We're not going back. -But what about Janny and the others? -We're getting out of here for good. You're going with me. -But AJ! -Well, the sun is to the west of us. We must be on the right line. -I can practically hear the ice tinkling in that long, cool glass. -Oh no, Tom, don't. I can't bear it. -Sanders, I have to get Helga back. -Steady, mate. -I have to! Don't you see? She must be with Magnus. I'm going [INAUDIBLE], before they take off. -Hey! -[INAUDIBLE] -Tom! -What's up, Tom? What's the matter? -I'm terribly sorry, sir, but I think I-- I cracked a rib back on the dredger. -Oh, let me have a look. -Helga, you can you look after Tom? You two stay here. It can't be much further to go. Blast him! -Thank you. -Can you hurry it up a little bit? -The last one [INAUDIBLE]. -Hey, watch it! There's 20 year-old dynamite in there. Touch is a cranky one. -There's a couple more boxes of gold over there. -We're gonna have to leave it, I'm afraid. We've got a weight problem now. -Janny! -What's the matter? -It's Janny. -It had to be, didn't it? -How much do you weigh, Singer? -About 13 stone, why? -You're really worth your weight in gold, aren't you? -Helga, Helga, keep down! -Maybe Henry's hurt! -What was that shot? -I just killed a rat. -Well, we get real problems now. You try to stall them 'til we can get to the plane. Singer! Singer! We're running out of time! -He's trying to shoot Janny! -That was just a warning shot. You really do love him, don't you? -Yes, I do. -Then why don't you go and tell him that? -Good bye, AJ. -Good bye, Elizabeth. -This damn thing can't get the range. I'll have to go in closer. You wait here. -I'm going in anyway. -Don't be crazy! [GUNSHOT] [YELLS] -He shot Janny! -That'll hold him. -You stupid idiot. -Janny! -Let me go! -What the hell are you doing here? -Harry, I-- [EXPLOSION] -What will happen to the ship? -Well, she took 20 years to die, maybe they'll let the old girl rest in peace? -Oh, all that gold gone up in smoke. -Oh, gold's hard to destroy. So is the memory of someone you love. [MUSIC PLAYING]
