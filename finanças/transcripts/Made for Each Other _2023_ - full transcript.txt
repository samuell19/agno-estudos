This program is rated G and is suitable for general audiences. That's wonderful, Rachel. Who are you making? My husband. That's incredible. What's he like? Well, he's my best friend and he's always kind. And he knows I hate spiders and he cooks all my favorite foods. He's perfect! He sounds perfect. Do you want me to talk to your mom about getting you into some art classes? Yeah. Nothing is never perfect, is it? There's always something that ruins everything and then I'm back to square one. I got nothing. I don't suppose you have any ideas. Sorry for venting again. You're just so easy to talk to. Ooh! What have we got here? Oh... likes skydiving. Cool. Vegetarian... healthy. Makes a mean cheeseburger. Seems a bit contradictory. Not looking for anything serious. Well, that's kind of a relief actually. Rachel! Honey, are you in there? Mom? What are you doing here? Surprise! Surprise! - Hi. - Hi. I was in the neighborhood. Right. Mom, it's not a good time, I'm in the middle of something. So... Oh. Well, Ethel says that you haven't called her son back yet and he said the date went very well. I was worried. I hadn't heard from you. Yeah. Well, if you must know, he showed up 20 minutes late and did something very offensive. No. What did he do? Ordered for me. And not even something good. A beet salad. Well, you know, how these investment bankers can be. So, he was a little bit late, but I think he took initiative by ordering you something healthy. Right. Besides, when was the last time you had a root vegetable? You know, Ethel was very upset with me. Mom, how about you stop setting me up with your friends' sons and then your friends will stop being upset with you. Yeah, but you are just being so unreasonable. Honey, nobody's perfect. And you're not getting any younger. There it is. Alright. Mom, you know, I have a class in five minutes so, I'm gonna need you to... Are you making a new piece? No. Wha... ah... when do I get to see it? What are you doing? Mom, I'll call to you later. - Okay? - Okay. Bye. Wow. Beautiful, Mia. You know, this one might give you a deeper groove right through there. Try it. Thanks. Alright. Good work today everyone. I will see you all tonight at the showcase. Now don't be shy. Please invite your friends, your family. You've worked hard. Your creations deserve to be recognized. May I have your attention, please? Hi. I'm Rachel Becker. I'm one of the instructors here. I wanted to thank you all for coming tonight to our student showcase. These dedicated artists have spent weeks of their lives for this one short moment where they get to share a part of themselves and the way they see the world with you. And I could not be more proud of all of them. Hold on a sec, hold on! Hi! Uh... I just wanted to ask you, are you gonna be showing any of your own pieces here tonight? Um... Mom? What are you doing here? She is so talented you have no idea. I mean, her sculptures, it's like they are magic. They're just, like, they're so real. And you students, you have no idea just how very, very lucky you are to have her as your teacher. I assure you, uh, I am the lucky one. And no, I will not be, uh, showing a piece tonight. Oh, come on. Just bring out one thing. Show everyone what you can do. Okay. That's it for speeches. Please donate to the school and thank you. Mom, what are you doing here? Well, I just saw your poster when I stopped by earlier. Why didn't you tell us? Us? I paid for the parking and the machine ate my card. - Oh, no. - Yet, again. Guys, the poster said it's a student showcase. What are you doing here? Well, we're here now and we were hoping you might showcase a piece here too. And why would I do that, Ruth? Well, because I thought you were building something new. I told them you wouldn't but they insisted. Okay, listen to me. It has been so long since those horrible reviews. You need to start putting yourself out there and not just with your art. Wow. Where's Ben? Couldn't make it to the ambush? Oh! I would never miss a Becker family ambush. - Hey. - Hi. I hope you don't mind David's tagging along. We're gonna go see his show later. That is a lie. I never miss an art student showcase. Ben's actually tagging along with me. David's actually really funny. You should actually come to the show later, Rachel. Well, that's very sweet but I have a feeling Rachel will be having some plans later. What? What plans? What have you done? Nothing. You're up to something. You'll thank me later. Andrew! Oh... hi everyone. Judith, thank you so much for inviting me. Oh, of course. Everyone, this is Andrew. Oh, no wait a minute, excuse me, Doctor Paff. This is Andrea's son, he's a cardiologist. He knows a thing or two about the heart. Oh! So, that's funny. Can I steal that joke? He's new to the city so, I thought I would invite him to your show. I do hope that's okay. Again, it's not my show. But nice to meet you. You too. I, uh... Mom, a word? Oh, yeah. Mom, I told you to stop setting me up. I know but look at him. And he does very well for himself. Uh, Rachel, why don't you show Andrew... oh, I'm sorry, that would be Doctor Paff. Calling Doctor Paff! Sorry. Okay, good. You know, your mother's not entirely wrong. I do understand matters of the heart. Oh, you're... oh, you're serious. Follow me, doc. This is actually one of my favorite pieces. Look at the detail. Yeah. Can I ask you a question without being offensive? You can try. How is this art? This artist was never allowed to eat fast food as a kid so, she developed this kind of obsession with it, doing anything she could to get her hands on it. To her, a burger and fries was the epitome of decadence. She literally put it on a pedestal. It's amazing how something one person might take for granted can mean the world to someone else. She never heard of an apple? Well, I think it's going really well. I can feel the heat from here. I'm not sure what you're looking at. - It was nice to meet you. - Thank you, yeah. What just happened? Why is the good doctor leaving? Because I asked him to. Why? He's such a catch. He's a specialist! Well, let him specialize in someone else. Honey, your sister's getting married very soon. Wouldn't it be nice if you could have someone to escort you? I'm not sure that Rachel needs to start going out with someone she doesn't like just so she can have a date for the wedding. I am not trying to set her up for a night. I'm trying to help her set herself up for life. She needs to... to be happy and loved. Rachel is very particular, you know that. It has to be the right person at the right time. Enough! I know you mean well but you have got to stop with the set-ups and let me figure this out on my own or I swear to you I will adopt a thousand cats and never leave my apartment again. Okay? Mmmhmm. Wow. That was such a personal moment to happen right in front of me, I feel like I'm part of the family now. You know David, I bet you're actually pretty funny. And I would really like to come to your show tonight but I'm gonna go home because I suddenly have a headache. Are we still going for Chinese? Hey! Rachel! - Hey! - Hold on. Ming, Tyee, you guys are the best. And I'll see you at Burning Man! Wild night? Well... it's a full moon, there's a storm brewing and I couldn't waste it sitting home at night. It's not supposed to storm, Doris. Oh yes, yes, the elbow never lies. Hey, what happened with the showcase? Oh. Well, my entire family tried to ambush me and set me up with a doctor. Again, with a doctor? Yeah. Any chance you're up for a drink and a kvetch? Drinking and kvetching, two of my favorite hobbies. I've got a nice box of wine too. You know, I've never seen my parents fight. - Really? - Mmhmm. Well, that has not been my experience. They always got along, made it look easy. I grew up with that so I know it's possible. It sounds pretty impossible to me but I'm a skeptic. Nope. I just haven't found it yet. I've dated great guys before but they always end up disappointing me. Something's always missing. I wish I could just date Clay. Oh, who's Clay? He's a sculpture I've been working on for a while. Uh-huh. So, you wanna date a sculpture? No Doris, I'm kidding. But I have been experimenting with hyperrealism. I took the best parts of every man I could think of. I couldn't find a perfect boyfriend so I made one. I think I need to see this thing right now. Families are fun, right? Constant struggle between smothering love and crushing disappointment. You know, my family of course wanted me to be a doctor. But I rebelled against that Jewish stereotype... and became a lawyer. Then I decided to try comedy and whoo... really cross a line. They haven't returned my calls in a year. Huh, yeah. Thank you so much everybody. My name is David Cohen. That's my time. This bar is sticky, I'm gonna go wash my hands. Okay. Alright, let's keep it going for David Cohen. Buddy! Thank you so much for coming. I know you're crazy busy with all this wedding stuff. Oh, come on, please, that was funny. - Good. - Really. And let me tell you, it's nice to talk about something other than peonies. Orchids, hydrangeas, uh... jasmine, tulips, roses, philodendron. Oh, hi... love. I was just saying how you make looking at centerpieces for hours and hours on end seem like mere seconds, really. Nice try. What about you, David? Are you looking for someone to pick out flower arrangements with? Nope. Why not? Well, I'm, uh, I'm just focused on the work. You know, this is my time to get good and I can't get good if I'm arranging carnations and calla lilies. You don't have to choose between love and comedy. This makes me happy, stand-up makes me happy, and I'm finally getting good at it. If I just focus on it I could build a real career. But that could take years. You're not even gonna try to date anyone? That's right. You know, I think under the right light, in a leap year, Mercury is in retrograde, he'd really hit it off with Rachel. Are you done? I just hope you laugh that hard when I'm on stage. Tell me how you really feel about it, Ruthie. Sorry. It's not you, it's her. I love my sister but she's... - Oh, impossible. - Picky. Yeah. Yeah. Her ideal man is a complete fantasy. Yeah. Basically if you're human you don't stand a chance. Wow. I mean, you weren't kidding. I'd date him. Why'd you decide to make him life-sized? I don't know. I guess I just wanted to make him feel as real as possible. So, let me ask you... describe your perfect man. I don't know. - Um... kind. - Mmmhmm. - Smart. - Mmhmmm. - Loyal, dedicated. - Mmmhmm. Someone I could bring home to my mother. Oy. A hopeless romantic, always on the same page. No conflicts. A best friend. Oh, still going. Just perfect. That's a lot to ask for in a human man. Tell me about it. Ah... err... Alright. Come on, Doris, spit it out, what? Well, my bubbe used to tell me about the legend of the Golem. Did you ever hear about it? No. No, I don't think so. Oh really? It's Jewish folklore. Hundreds of years ago rabbis would create sculptures of men made out of clay. Then they would bring them to life to defend their communities and, you know, generally tidy up around the house. A sculpture that does dishes. A girl can dream. Hey, do you wanna see something... cool? Am I gonna regret this in the morning? Well... probably. But you'll get used to it. Oh wow, Doris. This looks like it's hundreds of years old. It is. It's an amulet. According to my bubbe, it can bring a Golem to life. And why are you carry this around with you? I carry a lot of things around with me. - Who knows where I'll end up? - Mmhmm. We should put it around its neck just to see if she's right. Doris... What? It's not gonna work anyway. So, why do it? It'll be like a manifestation exercise, you know. You think of your ideal man and then you put it around its neck and the universe brings you your ideal man. What've you got to lose? It would take you longer to put together a dating profile. Fine. - Hmm? - Yeah. Alright, now, you know, concentrate. Oh, manifest, right. Yes. Concentrate. - It winked. - No. - It winked, it winked at me! - No, it did not. It did, it winked! It's... it's alive! You're terrible. - Oh well, we tried. - Yeah, we tried. See? Storm outside. Told you the elbow never lies. Right. Let's go find a last call somewhere. - Okay, yeah. - 'Kay. - Or we could go home. - Yeah, we could. Parker... Parker. Parker! How many times did I tell you not to interrupt me when I'm in the zone? Oh, sorry for coming back to my house. No, it's okay. Enough about me... how was your show? Uh, yeah, it was good. It was good. I got some laughs. How about you, did you get to chapter 15 of the LSAT book? Man, chapter, shmapter. I'm all about the lick and riff. Can't you dig it, man? Dig this, man. Your mom is depending on me to help you with that book. It's the whole reason you get to live here in New York City. Why do you get to quit being a lawyer but I have to go to law school? That is a really good question. Thank you. I will redirect to your mother, my sister. Good luck with that. Are we clear? You tell me. Oh... Hello? Hello? Is somebody there? There we go. Mom? Wow. So glad to see we've established healthy boundaries. Are you just waking up? I gave you a key for emergencies. Well, this is an emergency. You're not eating so I made you a kugel. Mom, I'm eating. You could've just called. Who calls? Besides, I happened to have been out in the neighborhood. With a kugel? Listen, uh, I'm gonna be putting you at the singles table at the wedding but don't you get mad at me. What? I thought I was sitting with you and Daddy. Yeah, we've had to move some things around. We've got some people coming in from out of state. And besides, I found out that there's gonna be at least four very desirable men at that table. Oh, my gosh. Well, that is perfect because what I really wanted was to go on a quadruple blind date at my sister's wedding. Well, I don't know what you want from me, I don't make the rules. So, unless something changes and you do decide to bring someone to this wedding, that is where you're sitting. But Mom... I have to go. I'm sorry, your dad is double-parked. I love you. Stop screening my calls. Oh, and eat! Love you too, Mom. Okay. Find a date for the wedding. Let's see what we got. Too old. Too young. Hot yoga enthusiast, likes cold showers. Who are these people? Good morning Clay. It is now. Who are you? Rachel it's me, Clay. What? Oh gosh. Is this some sort of prank you guys are playing on me? Come out, you guys. You got me! It's a new TV show, right? Oh, right, right. So, nobody hired a model who looks exactly like my piece. Where is my piece? Alright. Come out, guys. You got me! Are you not excited to see me? What? Who gave you that? You did... with Doris last night. Doris is... is not here? Um... Do you think I could... I always put my initials behind... could I look at... just your ear? - Ahhhh! - Whoa! Whoa! I don't know. But I'm glad I am. It worked. Oh my gosh, it worked. It actually worked. I need, uh, I need a... Coffee? One stevia, quarter cup of vanilla oat milk and a light sprinkling of cocoa powder. That's exactly right. How did you know that? I've been watching you make coffee every day for over a year. You've been watching me for over... Uh-oh. I know how sore your feet can get walking on this hard concrete all day. Yeah. Wow. Um... that's the spot but you've... Uh... wow. Sorry Miss Becker. Is class about to start? Class... Good morning. Hey, morning. Hi. Class, yes. Today for class I want you to go on a journey of self-discovery in the city. So... you, uh, you want, you want us all to leave? I want you to go on a journey of discovery. This is a model that I am interviewing for a future class on the human form. Huh. Looking... forward... to that class. So... Yeah. So why don't you, um... go soak in the city. - Right. - Yeah. Okay. Thank you. - Right. - Yup. I am going crazy. I'm going crazy. That explains it. Oh gosh, I should call Doris. It's already dialing. Oh. Thanks. Doris... hi. Yeah, I'm gonna need you to come to my studio right now. Yeah. Oh, and bring clothes. Man clothes. Aloha! I can't believe this is happening. Oh, it's happening. Hi. I'm Doris. Now, let me get this straight, is he real, real? I don't know. I'm hungry. I've never been this hungry before. Oh! Hang on a second here. Would you like some chocolate rugelach, Clay? Sure. What, you just walk around with a bag of rugelach in your purse? I told you, I like to be prepared for any situation. Mmm! This is the most amazing thing I've ever had. Well, it's the only thing you've ever had. But I still take it as a compliment. This is crazy! This is crazy! What am I gonna do with him? At least you got a date for the wedding. What? That is even crazier. What's so crazy about it? Life is crazy. You made a wish for a perfect man, now he's here for real... Isn't that what you wanted? Yes. Ah... I rest my case. Okay. Okay. Say, say I do take him to my sister's wedding. Okay? There's a lot to figure out. What's there to figure out? Like who he is, where he's from, what does he do? What are his hobbies? Hobbies? That's easy. Just being with you. Well, you two seem like you're getting along. I guess this is my cue to leave. No! Um... that's very nice, Clay, but, um... I was thinking something more like fishing. For you I'll catch the largest fish in the world. No! A thousand of them! I don't think a freezer could hold a thousand fish. Okay. A thousand fish is a lot of fish. - That's right, Doris. - I'm just saying. - Okay. - Maybe a sub-zero. We get it, Doris! First things first... My mom cannot meet you in that. Uh, I can't get used to hearing you speak. Oh. I'm sorry. Should I stop talking? No. No, it's... it's nice. I like it. Phew. All this shopping made me super hungry. Should we get some more of that rugelach? You know, this is New York City. We can do better than that. Thank you. Best dogs in the city. These aren't made of real dogs, are they? Trust me. Mmhmm. You know what I do miss though, being a kid. 'Cause when you're a kid and you quit something you don't like, everybody's all, like, "aww he's just discovering himself". But when you're an adult and you quit something it's all, "hey David, you're ruining your life!" But enough about every family gathering I've ever attended. Thank you so much, everybody. I'm David Cohen, I'll see you next time. Thank you. David Cohen, everybody. How funny was that? Dude, that was so funny. It was so funny tonight. What do you mean, I wasn't funny before or...? No, no, no. I mean... I'm kidding, I'm kidding, I'm playing. Okay, okay. Buddy, I feel good. I feel great. - Let's... let's hit the clubs. - Yes. Let's make this a bachelor party, we can even invite Ruth and her sister along. Yeah, what? No. You don't... You want me to invite my fiancée to the bachelor party? You do know how bachelor parties work, right? - This about Rachel? - No. - Uh-huh. - Maybe. - Mmmhmm. - It's... - She's sassy. - Mmmhmm. And she's funny. Well, I'm just saying you don't have a chance. I'm really glad you're my best friend. I can't imagine what you might say otherwise. What? No. You, you are great. I love you. It's her. She's just really, really picky. But going out sounds awesome. Let's shake up the night! Yeah, ha, ha! Oh... So much for the shaking? I gotta go. Ruth wants to rehearse the first dance again. Have a great time. - Nope. - Okay. So, we'll say you're saving up for law school. My parents need to think you have a stable future. A lawyer is someone who argues for a living. I don't have to argue with you, do I? Because I never want to. No, you never have to argue with me. Okay, that's enough, um... for tonight. We'll cover more personal history tomorrow. I'm tired but... I don't want this night to end. We've had a big day. Let's get you back to my office. The couch opens up, you can sleep there. I've spent some late nights there making... well you. I still can't believe this is happening. It's like a dream. You're my dream. That was the best kiss of my life. Yeah. Not too shabby. Did you see Irving? He got so old. Where's Rachel? Oh, she'll be here soon. Did she find a date? What do you think? It is not a good sign when the younger sister gets married first. Maybe. But in the end, I'm sure Rachel will find someone who deserves her. Oh... Hello! Mazel tov! Well, if it isn't Don Rickles. Where's your hoodie? I dropped it at the dry cleaners to be pressed. Mazel tov. I can't believe it. I can't believe the day is finally here. Neither can I. Hi Daddy. Hi David. Rachel. Wow. Uh... you look incredible. Uh... Mom, Dad, David, this is Clay. My date. Date? Mazel tov on the big day. You must be so proud. Hey. Oh wow! Wow! That's quite a grip. You play ball? Oh, I'm capable of playing all the sports balls. Basket, volley, dodge, foot. That's a lotta balls, right? He's very athletic. Uh, so tell me, how did you two meet? It's a really cute story. Here it goes. I took one of Rachel's night classes and noticed her right away. Not only because of her beauty but because of her skill and confidence as a teacher. Sounds very romantic. He was having trouble with his vase, looked more like a plate. Oh. It's harder than it looks, but she makes it look easy. And I spent the whole class helping him and we finally got a shape that you could put flowers in. Oh, right. So, we got it in the oven and we stayed after class for hours, talking until it was ready. The next day he brought me flowers in that vase. Uh, blue peonies, her favorite. Then he asked me out. And the rest is history. Wow, that's quite a story. Yeah, you two packed in a lot in the last 48 hours. Well, I think it's very romantic and it is a dream come true. We'll have to reshuffle the seating arrangements, Rachel. Okay. Hey, you can join me at the kids' table if you want. It's full. I'm gonna make you a special place card, Clay. What's your last name? Um... Gold... fish...? Goldfish? Uh, sorry. Goldfisher. Wait, wait, wait. Does he have two last names? Oh, sure. Fisher is his last name and Gold is his stage name. For modeling. Yes. Those are his names. Oh, you're a model. Of course, he is. But just for now, just to save up some money. Uh, Clay is thinking about going to law school. Oh... I like that. Well, I'm sure that Ben will be happy to help with those LSAT's when the time comes. What are those? Well it's the test that you take to get in. To law school. Right. I know. I was the one testing you. Oh! Funny guy you got here, Rachel. Yeah. Hey! It's Sandy Weinberg. He's in advertising. You two should meet. He's got all kinds of connections. Sandy! Sandy! I've got the next Fabio right here. Let me do the talking. Oooh! Let's go and find our seats. Yeah, it's very nice to see you again. Oh, my goodness, he is such a keeper. Isn't this the most beautiful thing you've ever seen? It sure is. Mazel tov! Congratulations to the happy couple. Come on, everyone give them a hand! You can do better than that. So, dinner will be served shortly, followed by wedding toasts. And then it's Hora time! Ugh. The toast. Okay, I will be right back. I'm just gonna take one more crack at it. What should I do? Eat. Oh. I am going to keep going. Thank you, I appreciate that. - Keep them coming. - See you later. Hi, glad you could make it. Find that perfect person you can imagine spending the rest of your life with but Ruth wasn't even halfway through her first date with Ben when she texted me. When she wants something, she goes for it. Zero hesitation. I wish I was more like that but I... Ugh. Come on, Rach. You had weeks to finish this. But... But I couldn't choose between fish or chicken for this wedding. What? I wish I were more like that but I couldn't even choose between fish or chicken for this wedding. You gotta put some jokes in these speeches. It's important. I have jokes. Really? I haven't heard one yet. There's more to jokes than just words. Yeah, laughs. It's more about delivery. Look, all I'm saying is I'm happy to help you. This is, uh... it's kinda what I do. Thank you but I don't need help writing about my sister. Suit yourself. I hope you enjoy the sound of a single cough and waiters pouring water while you deliver your cut and paste speech. Wait. What was that joke you said? About the fish. Mom, Dad, you two have set the bar for the perfect marriage. Aww... And now Ruth, you really have found your perfect partner. So Ben, as you are opening your air fryer and monogrammed tea towels... Just remember, the perfect gift... is grandchildren. Your new mother in law has registered for three. L'chaim! L'chaim! - Love you. - Love you, sissy. Yes, that was funny. That was so great. Who was your writer? Thank you. I hate to admit it but that might've been the best sister of the bride speech I have ever given. Mmhmm. So... I feel like I owe you something. How about a dance? Oh... - We don't have to if... - No. Um... Mmm! Have you had the lox with the hummus? Not even on accident. Here. I've already had three. Uh... You... you don't have to. Okay, um... it was great seeing you both. Rachel, enjoy the rest of the wedding. It's great. Of course. See? Looks like the picky woman has picked someone. You gotta let it go. There's nothing to let go of. We just... we had a moment. Yeah, but I mean look at him, looks like a Greek sculpture. And Judith and Mark love him. You can't compete with that. Gee, thanks for the pep talk. Oh... you know what I mean. No, it's fair. You know Ruth has a cousin, Barbara. - Babs? - Yeah. We met. Remember? Oh yeah. Well, beggars can't be choosers. Look, I... I'm just gonna focus on the comedy. Love is a pointless distraction. You know you're at my wedding, right? - Yeah. - Mmhmm. Thank you for coming with me. I've been dreading this day for months and it's turned out to be just... Magical. Yeah. I don't want this feeling to end. I don't want this feeling to end. Okay. Whose idea was it to move to a three-story walk-up? Yours. Right, sorry. Yeah. Well, at least the exposed brick's worth getting a hernia over. - Hi. - Oh hey. Hi. Thank you so much for helping. Nice to see you. You brought coffees, you're a life saver, thank you. I'm sorry Clay couldn't make it. I made him an Instagram page and he's been booking modeling gigs left and right. He's a model, he doesn't have an Instagram page? He's an old soul. Doesn't believe in social media. Hmm. That's okay. We found an extra set of hands. Oh. Who? Your friendly neighborhood rugelach man! In the house. I thought you said you were bringing donuts. Rugelach are better than donuts. Glad to see somebody appreciates good food here. What is that? Fig and date. - Fig and date? - Mmm. - Seriously? - Whatever. Why not chocolate? Chocolate's boring. Everybody likes chocolate. Exactly, it's chocolate. Why not bring something everyone will enjoy? Well, everyone doesn't have to enjoy everything. That's why they make different flavors. You combine them... like lox and hummus. I'm sure they're not that bad. Eh? Let's go get donuts. Mmhmm. Donuts. Sorry. - Help. - Uh-huh. So, where's your boyfriend? Oh, he's shooting a campaign for a new apparel line, if you must know. Oh, I thought he'd be out dipping gefilte fish in peanut butter somewhere. I gotta write that one down. You know, it's always stressful testing out new material. It's like sure, in my head it's funny but you never know how somebody else is gonna react. Yeah, I can relate to that. Art is the same way. I can make something so personal and have it take so long only to have someone look at it for two seconds and say something like... Ooh, I don't know. An uninspired mish-mosh of ideas masquerading as art but really just a lifeless lump of clay. At least you didn't hang onto that. Right. Healthy. You know, I would love to see some of your artwork. There's my girl! - Hey. - Hey. I didn't think you'd be able to make it. You know, shoot ended early. They said I did so well that they didn't need the rest of the day so, I wanted to come help. And... I brought everyone a little nosh. Ooh la la! Chocolate rugelach, my favorite. Maybe overrated. Whoa. This is the best rugelach I've ever had. Where'd you get this? I made them. - You made these? - Yeah. How? Doris showed me. Oh, and these... are for your purse. In case of emergency. Okay, so this is the part where I leave. I gotta get ready for a show later. Okay. Bye. Oh... a show? Can we come? Yeah, you wanna come to my stand-up show? Sure. Plus, that's what friends are for. Plus, I've never been to one. You've never been to a stand-up show? I've never been to any show. He's kidding. Clay is like my personal stand-up comedian. Right. I've been to all the shows. Alright. I'll see you guys. Thank you. Okay. Bye. - Round two? - Mmhmm. If you don't know what Yom Kippur is, it's a day of atonement. It's a day where we starve ourselves and apologize a lot. Not eating sounds awful. Oh, uh... it's so you can focus on thinking about your life. I can do that while I'm eating. And my mom would tell us not to eat too much when we broke the fast so we wouldn't get sick. Then she would make us the biggest meal of our lives. Brisket, kugel, chopped liver, challah, matzo ball soup. And desserts... plural. Have you ever seen a starving 13-year-old exercise self-control? My mom did the exact same thing when I was a kid. I miss those meals. Oh, what did she make you? I'll make you a feast like hers only bigger. Okay, um... let's talk about it later. Okay? Technology has made it so easy. Now I just hop on social media and I post... Whoops! My bad. Hashtag Yom Kippur... and call it a day. Okay, um... you don't have to laugh if you don't think it's funny, okay? I guess somebody doesn't get out much. Sorry. I was pretending to laugh but I know now I don't have to when it's not funny. Oh, my God. Um... I can't see you but I bet I know who this is. Ladies and gentlemen, my friend's, thank you. And you can apologize to me for this moment next Yom Kippur. I'm David Cohen thank you everybody! That's my time. Let's hear it for David Cohen! - Hi. - Hi. I had no idea that you were actually... - Funny? - Yeah! That was really funny. It's nice to be pleasantly surprised. Thank you. Thank you. I'm assuming I don't have to ask you how you felt about it, Clay. Well, the seats were comfortable and the drinks are tasty. Good. Uh... comedy's just not Clay's thing, I guess. I never noticed that before. Ooh. But this is my thing. Yeah. He's hungry. - Always. - Okay. So, when does your ad campaign come out? Should be any day now. There it is! Wow! Huh. I thought it'd be a lot bigger than that. - So, it's an ad for... - Jeans. That's why I'm not wearing a shirt. Oh... right. Makes sense. So, did you enjoy yourself tonight? I enjoyed spending time with you. But did you have fun? I had fun watching you laugh. Your laugh is like music to me. Really? Even when I snort? Your snort's like beautiful thunder. You are unreal. Will I see you tomorrow? Of course. Just make sure to leave my office before the students get there. Oh, that won't be a problem. There's a pole inside the couch bed that wakes me up good and early. Ugh. Gosh, we really do have to find you a better place to stay, huh? Good night. Good night. Wow. He's perfect. That's my boyfriend. - Parker? - Yeah? What's going on? David, the most amazing thing happened to me. You got into Yale? - Better. - Harvard. I got into a band. Well, more of, like, a combo. But they're super talented and I'm going on tour with them. Isn't that awesome? What about law school? I'm not going! I already talked to my mom. I'm gonna follow my dreams, just like you, only younger. That's... that's nice. Hey, thank you, Uncle David, for letting me stay here and for helping me and for always inspiring me. I won't forget you when I'm the biggest thing to happen to the jazz flute. Alright. Stay cool. - It's dark outside. - I know. Oh boy. Wow! Yeah. The room is, uh... ready to be moved into any time. Uh, rent's due on the 5th and I... I like people to recycle. Uh... let's see. What else, what else, what else? Ooh! No musical instruments. Building policy. I'll take it! Really? This is the first one we've seen. Why would I wanna live with a stranger when I can live with my best friend David. Best friend? Uh... I don't know if we're there yet. - Settled then. - Okay. I'm gonna put this right here so that you are the first thing I see when I wake up in the morning and the last thing I see when I go to bed. That's very sweet. This looks great, doesn't it? Yeah. You got a great view. I know. I can't believe it's mine. Hey! Come on in. Hi... oh my. What happened here? Julia Child happened. Uh-oh. Oh yes. I hope you enjoyed those cookies. I am so sorry. Okay, let me... let me help you clean up. No, no, no. You don't have to do that. Please, I insist. Wow. Where is Clay? He got called in for some top-secret ad campaign. Oh. Top secret? Well, there certainly weren't any secrets on his last one. Oh! Adorable. Oh! I would stand outside that office building for a few minutes every day, just hoping that I didn't have to go inside. You know, the place was so... joyless, so serious. It's just not who I am. You know, I didn't know what it was, but the first time I tried an open mic I knew. I put in my notice the following week. It was the best day of my life. How did your family react? They were totally cool with it. They loved it, you know? No problem. Really? No! No! Not... not even a little bit. You know, at some point you just have to stop thinking about pleasing your parents and you have to focus on what you want. I thought you were Jewish. What about you? Are your parents, um... thrilled that you chose the stable and lucrative world of art? Yeah. That was a tough sell. But I was a lot more sure of myself back then. They insisted that I at least get a degree in it so I could teach if I didn't make it. Turns out they were right. I don't think they were. You haven't seen my work yet. There's this, um... this really famous painting in my dentist's office. It's just like, uh... just a bunch of colored lines. The original version is worth millions of dollars. It seriously looks like a child drew it. What's your point? It doesn't matter if it's terrible, it's all subjective, and if it makes you happy, you have to keep trying. Also, I bet you're pretty good. You cleaned up! I was gonna do that when I got back. Thank you. What's in the envelope? Right. Good news. I was so excited, I asked if I could show you proofs from the shoot. Oh. Oh. So... so, you're modeling shirts. Which is why he's not wearing pants. - Exactly. - Yeah. I knew you'd get it. Thanks for coming. Oh, no problem. Sounded like, uh, this called for a fresh box, so... I have never had anyone treat me so well before in my life. Yeah? It's like I can't do anything wrong, Clay loves everything about me. I still can't believe this is real. This sounds like a romantic fairy tale. Why do I get the feeling there's a 'but' coming? - But... - Oh. I just... I... I can't seem to stop thinking about David. Oh, the comedian? I don't know what it is. He's blunt and sarcastic and he doesn't care if he annoys me. He's the complete opposite of Clay. But I... like talking to him. He makes me laugh. Makes you laugh? You wanna laugh? Watch Seinfeld! Listen to me, I've been around. You wanna find men who annoy you, they're everywhere. Take a walk down Fifth Avenue, throw a rock, you could hit a dozen. But men like Clay, they don't come along too often, if at all. He's perfect. Remember, you wished him alive? And I don't think he would continue to exist if he was no longer was serving his purpose. Wait, so... if we're not together anymore then he goes back to being a... Exactly. Listen, Golems were made for a reason. You take that reason away, that Golem is gonna go away. Oh, to Rachel and Clay, the happy couple. - L'chaim. - L'chaim. Thank you both. I can't remember life before you. I don't remember life before you. Oh, that was so sweet! That's how I feel about my little schmoopy. Oh, Mark, not here. But we do have a couple of good ones, don't we? We sure do. Ooh. Excuse me. Oh, that is my school. I will be right back. So, Clay, how's it going with the application? Actually, I'm thinking about going to chef school. Chef school? I think he means culinary school. Culinary school? What happened to law school? I really like cooking. It's become my passion. Well, that's great. Rachel's been raving about your food. Yeah, yeah. Passion is very nice but duck confit does not pay the rent. I thought being a chef was a good job. Maybe, if you're on TV, but working in a restaurant is brutal. I mean, there are long hours, you're on your feet all day, sweating. Mark, is this true? In the beginning, sure. But you get out of it what you put into it. Okay. Cooking is a very nice hobby. Mark loves to make a good brisket but we would never have been able to put our girls through college, Ivy League schools. You have to think about your future. Isn't that right, Mark? Err... I don't know what to tell you. Just follow your heart. The money will come. I'm sure you'll make the right choice. I know I did. Sorry about that. What did I miss? Nothing. Okay, I'm gonna go pay the bill. Two entrees? That boy can eat. Come on. - Thank you, Daddy. - You're welcome, honey. Oh, Clay... You are a very good boy. And I happen to know you love my daughter very much. Oh, I love Rachel more than anything in this world. Yeah, we all love Rachel very, very much. I wanna show you this. This was my great-grandmother's ring and Rachel's always loved it. Well, you should give it to her then. No, that's for you to give to her... when you propose. Propose what? Oy... Marriage. Do you want to stay with Rachel forever? It's the only thing I want. Well then you need to get serious. So, you need to show us that you can take good care of her and I will give you the ring. I'll do whatever it takes. You're a mensch. Welcome everyone to our four-week introductory class. I hope you are all ready to get messy. What are you doing here? Well, you came to check out my work so, I thought I'd come check out yours. Is that a problem? Nope. Oh! Careful. Watch your step. As Michelangelo once said, within every block of stone there is a statue, and it is the task of the sculptor to discover it. So... what do you see when you look at this ball of clay? Like... maybe a dish for my remote? It's gotta be pretty big, I've got a lot of remotes. Uh... great, great. Okay. But it's clay, so the possibilities are endless. Let's try and dig deeper, find a bit more meaning. How about you, what do you see? Maybe... a bowl for my fruit. Healthy. Great. Love that for you. Okay. And you... what do you see? Um... I don't know. A dog maybe? Okay. Tell us why. Well, I always wanted a dog. And as luck would have it, I am extremely allergic, so, I was never allowed to have one. I didn't know that. Yeah and, you know, I just thought it would be cool to have, like, a make-believe dog. Is that silly? No. No, that is... is very sweet. Okay. Let's get started. What do you say? First things first... wedging. Take your ball of clay... Get out all those air bubbles. That's right. Great. No cracks. That's holding up nicely. Well done. Okay, what's going on over here? Ta da! Ah... I mean, it won't stay. Do I need it? Heads are overrated anyway. Here, let me help you. Do you mind if I...? No, go ahead. Okay. We need to score the bottom. Okay. If it's too perfect, it won't stick. Wow! It looks so real. Yeah. Where is everybody? Class ended, like, an hour ago. Oh no, I was in the zone. Yeah, I could tell. What am I doing? I can't be... I can't be finishing your piece for you, I'm supposed to be teaching you. Believe me, if I did it, it would look a lot more like a potato than a dog. At least this one I can pretend it's real. And you know what? I'm gonna name it Rugelach. I had no idea how good you were. It's really inspirational to watch you do your thing. Thanks. Here, come with me. This is amazing. What are you doing teaching? You should have your own exhibit. I tried that, remember? You got one bad review. More than one. Once you put it out there everyone's got their opinion. Who cares about their opinions? I do. I care about what people think. Don't you? No. No. If I cared what people think I would still be a lawyer, hating every minute of it. What's this? Oh! Center for Contemporary Art and Design. Looks like somebody was thinking about putting themselves out there. I haven't submitted anything. My piece got... unsubmittable. So, make another one. Why bother? I really like teaching. You like hiding. What? You're scared. I get it. Hey, being vulnerable is terrifying. I get scared every time I get on a stage. No, you don't. I do, really. But it is the good type of scared, the kind you grow from. You know what, David? Talk to me when there's more than just friends in your audience. Talk to me when there's an actual critic tearing your work apart. At least I'm trying. Oh... Oh, David. I made some sushi. We're out of soy sauce so I had to make it from scratch. It's actually pretty easy. I am not in the mood tonight, dude. What's wrong? Ah, it's just... Women. Did women do something to you? No, I just... I don't understand them. Alright, they... they think they have it all figured out and I'm the crazy one for chasing my dreams. But they're the ones who are unhappy in their stable, perfect lives. All women are like that? No. No, just some. Someone I like, unfortunately. You should find someone like Rachel. She's perfect. Nobody's perfect. Even Rachel has flaws. Stubbornness for starters. Objections! Slander. What? You're out of bounds. Rachel is perfect. She has zero flaws. Why are you talking like that? Anyway, it's not a bad thing to have flaws. We all have flaws. Not Rachel. Okay. Fine. Rachel's perfect. Everything she does is magic. You happy? I'll allow it. What are you doing with my old LSAT book? Oh. Rachel's parents want me to become a lawyer so I can be worthy of her. Seriously? What about culinary school? Well I can still cook as a hobby. Is that what you want? You wanna change who you are for her? All I want is Rachel. Let me know if you need any help with the book. Oh, thanks. But I already took the practice test and got a perfect score. Of course, you did. Hey... Sorry for my outburst. Have a sushi. I'm not... I'm not much of a sushi guy, but... - Mmm. - Yeah? Is there anything you don't do perfectly? He said I was hiding. That I was scared. How dare he. If I wanted to submit something I would've done it. I didn't ask for his opinion! What's Clay's opinion? He doesn't have one. Why not? Because we don't talk about that kinda stuff. And why is that? When we're together everything is so perfect, so easy. I don't wanna ruin it by talking about a bunch of stuff that doesn't even matter. If it doesn't even matter how come you're still talking about it? What were you, a therapist? Bartender? Yes. I'll come take a look but I'm guessing air bubbles. There's my sweetie! A dollar for your thoughts. It's a penny for your thoughts. Your thoughts are worth a hundred times anyone else's. What's wrong? There's this art contest I've been thinking of submitting to. It's a really big prize. But I've been staring at that application for months and haven't done anything. Now the deadline's coming up and all I feel when I think about it is... scared. So scared it makes me sick. Then don't do it. Really? Nothing should make you feel that way. I mean, that's how we feel when something's wrong, so submitting must be wrong. Right? Yeah. Yeah, I guess that makes sense. I suppose I should stop worrying about it then. Why worry about something that makes you feel bad? You should feel great. Because you are great. Thank you. That is just what I thought you'd say. Oh, gotta get going. Got a big sock campaign. Slowly simmer at low temperature. So that's how you separate the yolk. That's what gives it a lasting taste. Very often restaurants use recipes that are simple, with simple ingredients. Privacy violations add, two tablespoons of butter... Pff. - Hey. Great set tonight. - Thanks. I'm glad the new material's working. Yeah. So listen, uh... we're having a showcase next month for Laugh Fest. I think you should be on it. Seriously, you think I'm ready? Yeah, I think you should give it a shot. Just make it the best five-minute set of your life. And don't mess it up. No, I won't. Hey, I won't. Thank you. Hi. Hey, um... I'm celebrating some really good news. Would you join me for a drink? I heard it's bad luck to toast alone. Sure. ♪ Take my hand and come with me ♪ ♪ We can fly over the seven seas ♪ ♪ Feeling the wind against my skin ♪ ♪ I close my eyes and feel my heart beating faster ♪ So fun, Victoria. ♪ Ready to run Let's get that clay wet, okay? Now tuck the excess beautiful pie dough into the pan carefully around the edges. Once all the edges are tucked in... Hey David, how was your date? Great. Uh... amazing actually. She's, um... she's a special lady, very easy going. Sounds like a great fit for you. Yeah. I just need somebody I can just get along with. Somebody who's not so critical, you know? Oh, I do know. Well I'm glad both of us have found people we get along with completely. I completely agree. You wanna join us? It's pie week. No, no. I'm gonna... I'm gonna go work on my set. I don't wanna mess up this showcase. Showcase, what showcase? Ah, it's just a little comedy festival. But I thought you said it could launch your career? Wait, is this Laugh Fest? Yeah. You told me about this festival, that's a huge deal. How come you didn't tell me you were auditioning? Well, I didn't wanna psych myself out. You know, I feel ready but it's my first time auditioning. And I know comedians who've tried out for years and still haven't got in. You'll get in. We'll see. You can't win if you don't put yourself out there, right? Good night. Hey David... Banana pancakes tomorrow for breakfast? With syrup? Homemade. Mmm. Perfect. You got it. I can't wait for tomorrow. Jeez. Then reduce the heat... No, no, no. Don't take the pie out yet, it's not done! That's a soggy bottom waiting to happen. Oh, I am so proud of you, sweetie. The Center for Contemporary Art and Design. I mean, what an honor. When you're a big shot, remember who bought you your first tube of silly putty. Alright, alright, now eat. Gosh, I can't even believe I got in. I submitted so last minute. Yeah. Well, Clay, I think you had something to do with igniting Rachel's passion again. Actually, it was David. David? The comedian. Huh. What a great guy! We've actually become pretty good friends over the past few months. The plot thickens. It practically congeals. To Rachel. Yes, to Rachel! L'chaim, yay! L'chaim! Does it come in a box? That's the good stuff, I want you to know that. That's the good stuff. You want a little more there? Yeah, sure... Careful. Uh, I'm gonna go make a quick phone call. I'll be right back. [G] Thank you for meeting me between sets. I am trying to get in as much practice as I can before this showcase. Of course. So, what do you get if you win the showcase? Well, you get to perform at the comedy festival. Which can lead to more professional gigs. You know, uh... touring, colleges, even TV spots. And that's guaranteed if you go to this festival? No, but it's... it's great exposure. A lot of the greats' careers started at Laugh Fest. What's it pay? Nothing. Hey. Hi. Uh... how's it going? Hey. Uh... really great actually. Um... so, that art contest. Um... I actually submitted and I got in. Wow. That's, uh... that's amazing. Congratulations. Thank you. I mean it. I don't think I would've done it if you hadn't so annoyingly pushed me to. So, I just wanted to say thank you for believing in me. Yeah. Well, you're easy to believe in. The other reason I'm calling is because I just found out the art exhibit is the same night as your show. Oh. So, you won't be able to, uh... be there. Yeah. Yeah, it's cool. Um... it's no big deal. You know what? I'm... I'm sorry for not being there for your big night. Talk to you soon. Okay. Oh... oh, here. You can put 'em both here. Oh... there it is. You could do it at the exhibit. It will be so romantic. Do you think she'll be happy? Are you kidding me? With a face like that, you've got a perfect score on the LSAT's and you can cook? It was like you were made for her. I was. Yom Kippur. Yom... uh... Yom Kippur is a day of atonement. Are you nervous? Nervous? Why would I be nervous? It's only the biggest night of my career. We starve ourselves and apologize a lot. Come on! This is my favorite shirt. This is a bad sign. I've never seen you this nervous before. Why would I be nervous? It's just the opportunity of a lifetime. But you got in! Your work is in the museum, that's enough. You know what? It doesn't matter. Because people are always gonna criticize your work once it's out there. Yeah, but you got into the showcase. Doesn't that mean you're already good enough? There's so much that's beyond my control. Like... the scout could have a bad day. I could remind them of somebody they hate. There could be a heckler. Everything needs to be perfect. And half my invites aren't even coming anymore. I'm sorry I can't be two places at once. I wish David could've made it. He's the one that encouraged me to put myself out there again. Look, don't worry about it. She's your girlfriend, you should be there to support her. I'm hoping she'll be more than my girlfriend after tonight. What do you mean? Give this a peek. You still have feelings for David. I don't know why. Well, love doesn't always have an explanation. It just happens. I'm sorry if I made you feel like you shouldn't be following your heart. Anyway, it doesn't matter because David is seeing someone and I have the most perfect man in the world who I know loves me. And I would be crazy to mess that up. Yeah. That's, uh... that's a beautiful ring. Do you think she'll say yes? I think she'd be crazy not to. I am so excited! Alright. The level of detail is truly remarkable. What inspired you to create this piece? Well, I was remembering a time when I knew exactly who I was and what I wanted. No second-guessing myself or wondering if I was making the right choices. I miss that girl. Hmm. Don't we all. Well, I think you have a bright future ahead of you. I'd love to see more of what you can do. Thank you. Thank you so... Oh! - Hi - Congrats. This is amazing. Is she also gonna wake up? Um... this is Clay, my boyfriend. Nice to meet you. - He's always kidding around. - Pleasure. Idea... If she does wake up, let's adopt her and name her Claychel. Oh, look! My parents are here. Why don't you go say hi to them. Alright. He looks very familiar. Is that the jeans guy? It is. Mazel tov. I am so sorry. Who are you? I'm Rachel's cool neighbor and close, personal friend. I am Doris. Doris... Doris, hi. It's nice to meet you. Shouldn't you be at Rachel's exhibit? Yeah. Hold your horses, I'm heading there. I just thought that maybe you'd wanna join me. No, I can't. I... I have a show in a few minutes. Actually, I need to get going. Listen to me, David. I think you want to be there. Honestly, I don't. Okay? Clay is gonna pop the question. I really don't need be there to watch that happen. You wanna be there because you love her. What? No... I... No, no, no. She's with Clay, Clay's a great guy. Look! This may be your last chance. Just go there, tell her how you feel. Hey. You're up, man. You going up or what? Thank you all for being here tonight to celebrate New York's brightest new stars. These bold new voices reimagine the human condition and represent the future of art itself. And it gives me great pleasure to announce our contest winner... Rachel Becker. Please join me. Um... thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. This is really such an honor. My work has always been so personal to me so it's really a joy to discover that this piece resonates with so many others. I'm very humbled to be... What's... what's going on? Hopefully you can make two dreams come true tonight. I'm sorry. Clay, what are you doing? Oh... Rachel, you've made me come alive. To me you're absolutely perfect. Go, go! Hurry! All I wanna do with my life is make you happy. All I need to be happy... is you. David? No, it's Clay. What are you doing here? I came to see you. But your show. It can wait. This is more important. Rachel, I'm still down here. Will you marry me? I'm in love with you. You're what? You love Rachel? Yes. And I'm sorry to do this to you because you... you've kind of become my best friend. But if I don't take my shot, I'm always gonna wonder if what she and I had was real. Rachel... I don't think you're perfect. I think you're stubborn and picky and you care way too much about what other people think. Thanks... David. But I'm not perfect either. I'm not gonna agree with everything you say, I'm gonna challenge you. That sounds terrible. And I'm gonna keep pushing you to do the things that scare you. And I'll be right there beside you, scared outta my mind, but the good kind of scared. The kind you grow from. I wanna grow together. Do you remember what you said about your perfect man? Someone who accepts everything about you, who supports you unconditionally. I would never fight with you or try to change you. I would sacrifice everything for your happiness. Because that's all that matters. Rachel, honey... what is there to think about? There's a lot to think about, Mom. Everything I thought I wanted was... This is just so far from how I pictured it. Honey, this is your perfect man. Your perfect relationship Like, like me and Daddy's. Isn't that what you always wanted? Our relationship isn't perfect. I knew it! Shh! This is the most exciting exhibit we've ever had. What are you doing? I love you, Judith, and I always will but our kids are all grown up now. And I can't continue pretending that our marriage never had any bumps. We just never let you kids see any of our real fights and now I wonder if that was the right thing to do because it gave you an unrealistic expectation of what relationships are. Mom. Is this true? Oh girls, I am sorry. My parents fought a lot and all I wanted was for you to see what a good relationship could look like. Mom, people can disagree and still have a good relationship. Yes. But you deserve someone who is devoted to you. Who will sacrifice everything for you. Your father wanted to be a professional mountain climber. Clay is giving up culinary school to go to law school for you. What? And if that isn't love, I don't know what is. You're going to law school? I've been accepted to Harvard. For you. For us. Mom, you are unbelievable. You can't just mold people into what you want them... Clay... you are perfect. You're everything I thought I wanted in a man. But sometimes what we want isn't... Always what we need. I thought I wanted someone who... Would never challenge you. Who would always do what you wanted. - That isn't... - Realistic. And it's not fair. To either of us. No, I'm sorry. I'm more sorry. He's even perfect when she's breaking up with him. I know. Oh, I guess I should take off this amulet then. No! But my purpose is to love you. Then I give you new purpose; to do what makes you happy. To follow your passion and then see where it leads you. To love again. Oh boy. Elbow never lies. So, I don't have to go to Harvard, I can go to culinary school? Go be happy. Clay... I just saw Ian Dimmerman. He owns some of the most chichi restaurants in town and he's always looking for talent. I'm telling you, he's really connected. I'll introduce you but you let me do the talking, okay? Okay. Ian. Ian, Ian! I got the next Bobby Flay right here. I'm, uh... I'm sorry they're dead. I was in a rush. Well, lucky for you, I don't need things to be perfect anymore. Good. That takes the pressure off of our first kiss. Yeah, well... if you're a bad kisser... I may need to re-evaluate. Oh, boy. Yes! So, do you need to re-evaluate?
