(MultiCom Jingle) (dramatic eerie music) (light ticking) - Hello? (dark scary music) (light screaming) (bell ringing) I'll be right back, I'll get you some help. Help, somebody help! Help, somebody help! (evil laughing) (loud screaming) (chirping) (soft eerie music) - Well, there it is. - [Man] Home sweet home. - It's so suburban. - [Man] Wait until you see the school. - [Woman] Best in the state. - And this is supposed to excite me. - There's a huge park. - Just down the street, fresh air for miles. - You could take some amazing pictures. - Of flowers and birds. - Come on, give it a chance, honey. - We're gonna love it here. - Love it here, I highly doubt it. (birds chirping) Flowers and birds, just what I need. I think I need some friends, not birds. (light clicking) - [Man] Come on, come on! (exciting energetic music) (people yelling) (people cheering) (tense slow music) Hi, excuse me, could you tell me where homeroom nine is? (tense scary music) - Hi. I said hi. - Oh, hi. - I'm Mike. - Dawn. - So, what's your sign? (giggling) - [Dawn] Cancer. - Oh. - Oh, um, could you tell me where homeroom nine is? (deep scary music) - Excuse me, I've gotta go. - Watch yourself, new girl. - What's your problem, that hurt? - Accident (mumbles). (giggling) (people talking quietly) - Can I sit with you guys? - Sure. (soft peaceful music) - I'm Dawn. - Frannie. - I'm Flo and this is Mary. - So, you're new here, huh? - Yeah, yeah. Totally sucks. - Well, it could be worse, I mean, you could've lived here your whole life I guess. (light laughing) - So, where are you from? - Different parts of California mostly, LA for the last two years. - Cool, LA. - Was it like Beverly Hills 90210? - Uh, no, not at all. That show is unrealistic. It's more like Baywatch. (girls laughing) (girls laughing loudly) - You'll get used to her. - Who? - [Flo] Mercedes. - She just thinks she's all that. I mean, if you stay out of her way, it's really not-- - It's Dawn, isn't it? - Well, Dawn, I'm Mercedes. I'd like to be one of the first to welcome you to Pilgrim Town High. I see you found yourself some buddies. They can bring you up to speed on how things work around here. You can do that for me, can't you, Frannie? Oh and Flo... (tinkling music) Enjoy your lunch. (laughing) (simple playful music) (girl screaming) - Cockroaches again. - Oh, that's so not funny. (girls laughing) - Wait! - You witch. - What did you say to me? - You heard me, why don't you pick on somebody else? - My pleasure. - Oh no! - It's okay. - Oh, gross. - It's a fuzz ball. - Okay, it looked just like one. - How did she do that? Who has that many bugs at their disposal? - [Frannie] I'm so sick of Mercedes and all of her stupid pranks. - You know what, she probably spent like weeks crawling around in her attic. - No attic around here! (screaming) - What do you mean? - This bug is only found in certain parts of Eastern Europe. It can't survive in our climate. - [Frannie] Sometimes I wish you weren't such a damn brainiac, Mary. (bell ringing) - [Girl] I hope we don't have to run again. - [Girl] I know, I hate that part. (deep tense music) - [Teacher] All right, girls, come on, let's go, let's go. (deep rhythmic music) (girls laughing) - Looks like you put on a few pounds there, fatty. That's quite the fashion statement. - Shut up, Mercedes. (girls oohing) - Now, that's not very nice, is it, Dawn? I suggest you take a lesson from your geeky little pals and get in line. I don't know where you come from or who you think you are, but this is my school, not yours! You're nobody here, get it? Punch ball. (girls laughing) - Come on, Dawn, let's go. - Oh, Mercedes, why don't you keep this? Something to stuff your bra with. (girls oohing) - I cannot believe you said that to her! - The look on her face was like... - Guys, that sucks, I liked those clothes. My mom's gonna freak. - (mumbles) she'll never notice. - Yeah, but what am I gonna do until then? - We can hang out at my house. I have a cool CD collection. - Yeah, it rocks. - Really? - Totally, hang out with us. - Okay. (girls giggling) - What you smell is the formaldehyde. It keeps the specimens fresh. Although I can assure you these frogs are quite dead. (laughing) - Hey, Michael Charming. Who are you taking to the school dance? One of your little specimen friends? (girls laughing) - Let's see, dead frog, Mercedes. Mercedes, dead frog? You make the choice so simple, ribbit. (tinkling music) - [Teacher] Okay class, let's begin dissecting. (deep dark music) - [Man] Ow, that hurt! (dark scary music) Hey, (mumbles) to yourself. (dark eerie music) (loud explosion) (soft mumbling) - I think that's enough frogs for one day. Will somebody walk Mr. Charming home? - [Dawn] I will. - Thank you. Everyone else, back to work. - Come on, Michael, let's go. (soft relaxing music) - A hallucination of some kind. Maybe the light from the lamp reflected off the metal tray. Maybe the frog wasn't dead. No, that frog had a beating heart. I'm never gonna live this down. - It looked kind of cool. - Yeah? - Yeah. One minute you were standing there and the next, boom, you were on the floor. - Oh. - No really, don't sweat it, tomorrow it will be old news. - You think so? - Yeah. (soft peaceful music) You know what I don't understand? How is it that Mercedes is so popular when she's so mean? What's the deal with that? - I don't know, it seems like the Marie Antoinette thing. She rules through terror. - I guess, I know she has something to do with Michael getting all freaked out today. - How? - [Dawn] I don't know, I just have a feeling. - Michael Charming probably imagined the whole thing. - But it's not just Michael, it's like weird things happen to anyone who gets in Mercedes way. - Yeah, creepy weird things. - Guys, I say we start watching Mercedes closely, I mean her every move. (slow dramatic music) Between the four of us, we should be able to figure out just what she's up to. Who's up for it? Sweet, look out, Mercedes. - Yeah, more like we should be the ones looking out. I got a bad feeling about this. (giggling) (tense deep music) - Hey, you guys, you gotta check out Mercedes, she's doing her nails. Come on, come on. (intriguing rhythmic music) - Who's there? (scary deep music) The powers of dark, the powers of light, fill within me, strengthen my knight. Now, could you make (mumbles) fall in love with me? Make Mr. Brett change the math test Tuesday. (deep rumbling) (eerie soft music) Whoever you are, I will find you! - I don't know, she's got like superpowers or something. - Totally. - Okay, she's all ready got a hold over the school. I mean, who knows what's next. - The PTA. - [Dawn] We have to figure out where she gets her powers from. - Wicca. - Mary? - Wicca. It's the religion that witches practice. From what I've read, she fits the profile. Mercedes is a witch. - And we've got the proof. - Do you really think this is gonna work? - Why wouldn't it? - You know, maybe because of her evil powers, she can't be photographed. I bet she can't even see her reflection when she looks at the mirror. - She's not a vampire, Flo, she's a witch. - [Flo] Oh, right. (gasping) - Geez, Michael, you scared us to death. - Sorry, sorry. - Good one, Michael, now we're gonna have to reprint this. - Michael, what do you want? - I just-- - We're kind of busy right now. - Can I please speak to Dawn? Thank you. (mumbles) I just speak to Dawn. I've been trying to get you alone for the past few days but you guys always seem to be together. - We're doing a project. - Oh, right, cool. - What is it, Michael? - Well, you know the dance is this Saturday, and well, I was think (mumbles) checking it out. Anyways, I really didn't wanna go alone. I mean, I wasn't sure if you had any plans going on. Because, I mean, if you're gonna be there, maybe we could dance together. - Are you asking me out? - Mmm, yeah. - I'm flattered. But I don't think so. Well, I wasn't planning on going anyway. See, I'm a really bad dancer. - No, that's cool. - I'm really sorry. - No, whatever. I'll see you guys around. (laughing) - Frannie! - Sorry. (dramatic deep music) - Well, we have the picture. Now what? (simple rhythmic music) - Where are these? - In the basement. (loud banging) (coughing) In the basement stacks. - Let's go. (intriguing rhythmic music) (light coughing) - Find anything? - No, just some stupid potions. - Nothing in any of these about an amulet. - Geez, they were really into the eyes of newt back then. - Yeah, what's the deal with that? - Why don't we ask for help? - You mean... - Well, she is the librarian, right? (bell dinging) (eerie slow music) - Yes, precious? - I was wondering if you knew-- - Speak up, precious! - Do you have anymore-- - Shh! - Do you-- - [Librarian] Shh! - Do you-- - Shh! - Do you, do you know if there's anymore books on witchcraft? (light giggling) We've looked at all the books down in the basement, we're trying to find more information on this amulet. (light footsteps) (soft talking) That is one freaky librarian. I don't know what her deal is. (screaming) - Shh! You maybe in the basement, girls, but this is still a library. So, you want to know about that amulet, eh? I always wondered when someone would come looking. See, where did that get to? Pilgrimtown has a history of witchcraft, just have to know where to look. - That's it, that's the amulet. - The devil stone was said to have been born from the fires of earth by Satan himself. 350 years ago, the devil stone was under control of Aubrina, a vicious and cruel witch who terrorized the (mumbles) of Pilgrimtown for years. She tried to turn innocent village children into an army of slaves. But one day, the townsmen rose up against her and hunted her down. She used all of her powers to be strong (mumbles) and she could not (mumbles). Finally, when she had no escape, she vanished to thin air leaving behind the powerful amulet for the day when she returned. And she (mumbles) upon the people of Pilgrimtown. - There's a girl in school, Mercedes, she has part of the amulet, she can do things. - She's a witch. - Quiet, she's only have the witch she could be. (eerie dark music) - [Fannie] I knew it, who said small town rumors were never true? - Relax, you have nothing to fear from me, precious. I'm merely the keeper of the stone. An honor passed down through the ages. I only wish I'd found both halves to guard them from evil, but now, thankfully, I can bestow that honor upon a new keeper. - Whoa, wait, you don't want me to be the keeper. I lose everything, ask my mom. - My time is coming, I can't protect the stone forever. You must guard it now, guard it with your life. - But why me? - I've looked into your soul, precious. The amulet is safe in good hands. Now... Take this and go. - Don't we at least check this... (screaming) Couldn't we wait until morning to do this? I mean, there are animals and stuff out here at night. - Yeah, vicious man eating squirrels. We're in Massachusetts, Flo, relax. (yelling) - Gotcha. - Cute, so glad you've come out of your shell. - Guys, we're here. That's the tree. (soft dramatic music) - [Frannie] Now what? - I don't know, there wasn't much to it. - Well, what if we do it wrong, I don't wanna accidentally mess with (mumbles)? - Please, if Mercedes figured it out, how hard can it be? - SHe's got a point. - It says here that when a convent of witches has cast a spell, they have to all be touching so the spirits pass through them. - Is that what we are now, a convent? - I guess so. - Great, now everyone at school's gonna think we've gone goth. - Okay, um, everybody join hands and kneel. (soft eerie music) (owls hooting) Close your eyes and repeat after me. The powers of dark, the powers of light, flow within me, strengthen my night. - Powers of dark, powers of light. (mumbled chanting) - Ow, geez, Flo, you got like Schwarzenegger grip! - [Flo] Sorry, what do you want, I got scared! - Yeah, we noticed. - So, is that it? - I guess so. - [Flo] Thank god. - Look at my hand. We're not like lost, are we? This is a lot further than I remember. - I know, I'm beat. - Would you guys stop it and we'll be home before you know it. (loud rumbling) Ow! This thing's stronger than I thought. - It's totally amazing. - Yeah. - [Woman] Dawn, is that you? - Yeah, mom, I'm home. - Oh, hi girls. Have you been home long? I didn't hear you come in. - We just popped in. - Well, Dawn, dinner's ready in five. I'm sorry, if I'd known your friends were coming over, I would've made more. - That's okay, Mrs. Reilly, we were just leaving. - Mom, I'll be down in a minute. - All right then. Don't forget, dinner's in five minutes. (giggling) - Okay, everybody give me your hands, we have to make a pact. - Is this gonna be a blood pact? - Oh, Flo, you're such a wimp. - No, I'm not, it's just, I'm sanitary. - Just give me your hand, Flo, no blood. We can all trust each other, right? - Right. - Okay, we make a vow, a solid pledge that everything we've learned about, the devil stone, the magic powers, the book, everything, it remains a secret that never leaves this room. Agreed. - [Girls] Agreed. - So, where do you think we should try our powers first? - Boosters, we need more boosters. For those of you who don't know, the boosters are a very important part of the school. They help with fundraising and boost, if you will, moral at our football game. Well, we can't all be cheerleaders. - He's the only man I know that can actually bore himself. - Wake me up when this is over. - Dawn, why don't you try out some magic. - Yeah, this is a perfect place. - No, no, I'm not ready. - Who wants to be a booster? Let's get a show of hands. - Talk, talk, talk. - [Man] The freshman dance is this Saturday. - He could be a little shorter. (tinkling music) Did I do that? - No, he's on a (mumbles) diet. Of course you did! - What do I do, what do I do? - Make him big, make him big. - Make him big, big, big. No, make him the way he was before that. No, before that. Make the principal his normal size. - (mumbles) more interesting. - Only slightly more interesting. - Does anybody have any questions? (people laughing) (applauding) Thank you, students. Thank you for your kind attention. (kids laughing) - What'd I miss, what'd I miss? (exciting fun music) - I think it's time we try on Mercedes. - Turn her into a feral pig or something. - Okay. - Well. (mumbles) Bummer. - It's actually quite logical. It says here that the magic of the amulet is gathered by the wearers heart. If the wearers heart is kind, no evil will come from the magic. - Sorry, I can't help it. - Let me, I'm a Girl's Scout. - No, the librarian gave it to Dawn for a reason. - So, we're like the good witches? How unfun is that? - But we can still beat her at her own game. We'll just undo all the magic that she does. She won't know what hit her. - Oh, sorry, I'm very sorry. I'm sorry, I'm very sorry. (fast exciting music) (girls laughing) - The cheerleaders are wearing (mumbles). (fast rhythmic music) - You're in my way, freshman. (laughing) - Whoa, what's happening? (fast energetic music) (groaning) - Hey, Dawn, over here. (light snapping) - Oh, I almost forgot, you guys are all invited to my birthday party on Friday the 13th. Wear a costume. - Cool. - Well, well, well. It's not over yet (mumbles). Let's go. (high pitched eerie music) (laughing) I have a little something for you, Dawn. Consider it a birthday gift. - I'm not afraid of you, Mercedes. - [Mercedes] Oh, you will be, you will be. (light fun music) (loud knocking) - Hey. (owl hooting) (deep scary music) - Spirits of darkness, grant me the spell. The day is done, the sun is past. Let night fall on Dawn and deep and vast. - [Girls] Happy birthday, Dawn! (people cheering) - Happy birthday, Dawn. - Happy birthday. - [Flo] Don't forget to make a wish. - Right. (people cheering) (eerie dark music) I feel so tired. - Dawn. Dawn! Something's definitely wrong here. (dark scary music) (creepy laughing) - So, no cake? - NO, no cake! We gotta figure out what happened here because clearly Mercedes cast a pretty evil spell. - Spell? - It's a long story. This is no ordinary nap, Michael, trust me. We have to wake her up. (high pitched eerie music) - Dawn, wake up (mumbles)! (playful rhythmic music) - What are we gonna tell Dawn's parents? - We can't tell them anything. - Well, we can't let them find her like this. - Bring her to my brother's tree house. We'll leave a note saying we're having a sleepover at my house. - Let's change first. - Okay, come on. (eerie soft music) - Okay, Michael, stand guard, I don't trust Mercedes. And no sleeping! - All right! (fast intriguing music) - [Flo] She's not gonna be here, Frannie, it's past midnight. (loud knocking) (light creaking) - Go first, Mary. You can go first. You're next. (fast rhythmic music) - Hello. Mrs. Hatch! (deep rhythmic music) Hello! Hello! - Looking for me? (screaming) - You're getting really good at that. - Thank you, precious, I try. What can I do for you? - We need your help. Mercedes has put a spell on Dawn. - Yes, I know, the eternal sleep. The most vexing turn of events. Give me the stone. Give me the stone. Come with me, come with me. - Come on, Charming, stay awake. - Amulet of destiny, show forth, let us seize (mumbles) never be. (high pitched music) - Oh, I've seen this kind of movie before. He's gonna have to fight a dragon or something (mumbles). - Shh! - Hey, it's Dawn. (soft peaceful music) - Dawn needs the kiss of a brave and gallant fellow. And she needs it quickly. When did she fall under the spell? - At 9:00. - Then you have until 9:00 tonight to wake her. If she should sleep for a full day, she will sleep forevermore. - Brave and gallant? Have you checked out the guys in this town? - Well, you'll just have to conjure one up, won't you? - Of course. - Now, where did that get to? Ah, this is it. (coughing) Now, brave and gallant, brave and gallant. (mumbles) That's not it. Here we go, one brave and gallant fellow. Under the rays of the morning sun, concoct a brew of one eye of newt, two toad stools, three grasshopper wings and a little old spice. There, this shouldn't be too hard for you girls. - Couldn't you just conjure them up? I mean, you seem to be the most experienced witch in the room. - I'm not a witch, precious. Just a librarian. - Yeah, but how do you know so much about all this stuff? - Research. (soft depressing music) (fast intense music) (horse trotting) - Hello! Awesome. (soft enchanting music) - Hi. - Hi, you look just great. - Thanks. - Of course this is my dream, I wouldn't have you looking any other way. If a guy has a crush on a girl, he doesn't dream of her looking like a dog. Not that you look like a dog. I'll just stop talking now. - I'm glad you came by. - So, what are you doing here? - Waiting. - Waiting for what? - A prince, I guess, I don't know. Between you and me, it's getting (mumbles). - I saw a guy run by here earlier. (mumbles), it could be your guy. - Maybe. Personally, I prefer Leonardo Decaprio but what can a girl do? (mumbles) Cool. So, do you wanna play frisbee or something? - Can you play frisbees? I mean-- - It is your dream, Michael, dream one up. - Yeah, right. (soft tinkling music) (light laughing) (soft peaceful music) - Michael! Michael! Michael. Michael! Wake up, you're on guard, remember? What do you think you're doing? - Playing Frisbee. - What! - I'm awake, I'm awake. - All right, whatever, stay put and stay awake! Let's get cooking. (slow dramatic music) (light whispering) - [Girls] Bubble, boil, melts and mince, conjure for us a gallant prince. - Hey, guys. What? There's no sign of Mercedes and I'm getting hungry. What? - Okay, we're definitely doing something wrong here. - You know, maybe we should try mixing it in something else. I mean, the spell does call for a cauldron, not a crock pot. - You know what, that's just because when the book was written, they didn't have crock pots. Besides, my mother doesn't cook in a cauldron, sorry. - Hey, don't get mad at me just because you don't know what you're doing. - Oh, like you do? - [Flo] At least I read the stuff. - [Fannie] You know what, I read it, I just don't get all of it, okay, witch hazel. - Hey! Let's use him. - Him? - [Mary] He's all we got. - She's right, what do we have to lose? - What are you guys talking about? - Nothing, just stand still. Bubble, boil, melt, and mince, turn this geek into a prince. - What! How'd you do that? - Well, that's lame. - Give it to me. You have to wish like you mean it. (laughing) - [Fannie] Oh my god. - Could somebody please tell me what's going on? - Geez, Flo, ween yourself off the '80s MTV all ready. - I'm going home now. - No, you're not going anywhere. - Maybe we should just let him kiss her? - Me, kiss Dawn Hurley? (exciting fast music) - Hey! No tongue. (fast rhythmic music) Come on all ready! - Guys, we have a problem. I was here the whole time, no one went up. - Maybe she woke up, went home. - When? - Now we'll never save her. (laughing) - [Mercedes] That's right, Flo, give it up! - What'd you do with her? - Oh, don't worry, I made sure she's someplace that you'll never find her. In fact, it's a lot like Pilgrimtown only a little bit more rustic. (evil laughing) (loud booming) - All right, now will someone please tell me what's going on here? - Mercedes is an evil witch who's trying to take over the school so Dawn and all of us were trying to stop her, but Mercedes put Dawn into an eternal sleep that can only be broken with a kiss of a brave and gallant fellow who we have to find by the time the dance starts tonight or she'll never wake up. - Oh, that's what I thought. And am I that brave and gallant fellow? - I don't think so. - Why not? Just because I'm skinny doesn't mean that I can't be brave and gallant too. - Yes it does. - It doesn't matter, we don't even know where Dawn is. - Mary's right, I mean, how can we save her if we can't even find her? - [Michael] Another world, parallel universes. - What are you babbling? - Parallel universes. Mercedes said she hid Dawn in another world, right? One that was like ours but a little bit more rustic, older. She must've created a portal to a parallel universe and hidden Dawn there. - Yes, I understand. - No, no, hang on. In English, Einstein. - Okay, all right, just a sec. Okay. You see these lines, longitude and latitude, all in parallel to each other? Well, they're not really, you can't touch them. They only exist in space and time. Suddenly the (mumbles) between alternate universes, universes that coexist in the same timeframe, even share many of the same elements, yet never overlap. They all live peacefully, moving forward in time, oblivious to the parallel universes beside them. Somewhere in Pilgrimtown there must be a porthole! A gateway to these other worlds! - And who believes this? - [Michael] Well, my whole Dungeons and Dragons group, for one. - Please. - [Flo] No, it's true, I read about it in physics. - It's kind of like traveling to another dimension, Frannie. - Theoretically. - And you guys buy this? - You're telling me you don't believe Michael's theory, yet you accept the fact that we just magically turned him into a prince? - Again, she makes a good point. All right, well, what do we do first? - We have to find the porthole that Mercedes created. She probably hit it somewhere she's sure nobody's gonna look. (exciting low music) (horn beeping) - [Mercedes] Hurry up, we're gonna be late! (deep intriguing music) - Do you realize we're doing a breaking and entering? - So, don't get caught. (deep rhythmic music) (loud clanking) - What exactly are we looking for? - Just (mumbles). Anything unusual. - Hey, guys, check it out. Yum. - Okay, let's go find her bedroom. (deep rhythmic music) (eerie high pitched music) - [Woman] Welcome home, Mercedes. Ready to rock the universe, no one is (mumbles) than you, Mercedes. - [Michael] Oh, come on guys, how cool is that? - [Fannie] Keep looking. - Ah, guys, I can't get the mask off! Oh, just kidding, sorry. - Look at this, mean old Mercedes sleeps with a teddy bear. (deep growling) - Great, now the whole neighborhood will know that we're here. (deep growling) - We're looking in the wrong place, guys. I mean, where does Mercedes really spend all her time? - Cheerleading. - Of course. (deep growling) - Oh, shut up! (whimpering) Tough love. - Let's go! Whoa, I've never been in the girl's locker room before. - Hone your hormones, Michael, we've got work to do. - Okay, let's spread out and find Mercedes locker. (laughing) - Found it, subtle really. - Hear anything? - Can't tell, just a little hum. Just a sec. Stand back. - [Fannie] What are you doing? (loud banging) (loud whooshing) - Wow. - I gotta hand it to you, Michael, when you're right, you're definitely right. What do we do now? - [Michael] Jump in, I guess. (dark scary music) - Oh, he just worships me. (peaceful guitar music) (people talking lightly) (fun fast music) - Wow. (mumbles) - Something tells me she's not here. This place isn't quite rustic enough. - Michael! Come on! (dark scary music) (applauding) (screaming) (dark deep music) - Is everybody okay? - Yeah. - I think so. - Where are we? - I don't know. - Look at this. - Get down! (intense fast music) - Hey, that's the guy from my... - We should follow him! (strong slow music) - I'm tired, I don't see why we can't just rest a bit. - Because it's all ready 7:00, we only have two hours left! - We don't even know if we're in the right universe. - No, she's here, I can feel it. I don't know how but I've never been more certain. (soft enchanting music) Sweet. - That's the same castle (mumbles). This is definitely it! - Yes, let's go! (triumphant music) - Wow, awesome. - You brainiacs are a bit smarter than I thought. - Someone called us brainiacs. Watch your tongue with me, dweeb! (laughing) Is this the best you could do, girls? This is your prince? Oh, how truly tragic for you. But hey, I hate to disappoint you all but I'm just not a real big fan of happy endings! So, thanks for this, Frannie. Now the devil stone and all of its powers are mine! (evil laughing) (scary dark music) (screaming) (loud rumbling) (fast intense music) - Now what? - We've gotta find our knight. Don't they go together, knights and dragons? (deep rumbling) - We don't have any time. - We can handle this, ladies, we just have to use our heads. - This coming from a guy who faints at the sight of dead frogs! You do realize the dragon (mumbles). - All Mercedes needs is a little cocktail. (mumbles) Here's the plan. (eerie high pitched music) The giant (mumbles) ready. - Ready! - What can I say? I always cut shop. (deep dark music) You know, she actually looks better this way. Especially personality. - Come on, let's go. (fast rhythmic music) (screaming) (mumbles) last night, Mercedes. (mumbles) - (mumbles) a big world, isn't it? (deep dramatic music) Over here, zit face! You know, this is the best your skin has looked all year! (screaming) - Over here, you put on a few pounds, Mercedes! Or should I say tons! (growling) He's toast. - And she doesn't look the least bit tired. - Come on, Michael, where is he? (loud pounding) (screaming) - Not so fast, trampoline! (mumbles) come on. - Come on, Michael! - Come on, Michael! Do it, come on! (growling) - Turn around! - Can you guys get me here? - [Mary] Can I get some help, please? - Pretty awesome, Michael. - Thanks. - Quick, tie her up. You won't be needing this anymore, Mercedes. - Okay, let's go, there's not much time. (soft enchanting music) - [Mary] She looks beautiful. - I'll say. - Hey, stud, here's a big moment, don't blow it. - Please, I don't do well under pressure. (soft peaceful music) (laughing) - What a dream I was having. There was a witch, and a necklace, and... But... Where am I? - We're not in Kansas anymore, that's for sure. - Dreams aren't overlooked on. - I don't see why we just don't leave her here. It's not like she's gonna be missed. - We are going back, Flo, same way we came in. - And how exactly did we come in? - You remember Space Mountain, right? Same thing. - Oh! - Listen to me, it's very important. The amulet you carry must be destroyed, smashed into pieces. It's the only way to destroy the evil spirits. - She's really freaking me out here, can we just go? - Hey! (light neighing) - It must be destroyed! Must be destroyed! - Oh, oh. - Hey, hey guys. Come on, untie me, huh? I mean, what's a little joke among friends, right? - Friends? - Yeah, you know, you guys are cool. You're like the coolest kids in school now. All right, so, come on, what do you say? - Sorry, Mercedes, you're not our type. - What? You losers better untie me, now! Don't you realize there is two years left of school. I will make those the most miserable years of your life! (screaming) Get back here! Come back here! - Dawn, the stone! (loud banging) - You have something of mine, girl. Give it to me! I swear, it's always the kids! To think, 100 years I have to deal with little brats trying to (mumbles). Don't make me take it from you, dear, because I will take it! - You'll never get this from me. - So be it. (screaming) (deep dramatic music) - Go Dawn. - It's working, don't give up, Dawn. (mumbles) come on, Dawn. - Oh, those little brats, where did they get to? (crazy laughing) (laughing) - You did it! - No, we did it! - Everyone have time for the dance? - Let's go. - Wait, there's something we have to do first. (slow soft music) Let's make a circle. (loud wind gushing) (light giggling) Thanks, guys, for waking me. - You sure are a heavy sleeper. - Yeah, next time try staying in this dimension. - Come on, guys, let's go dance. We can make it if we hurry. - Dawn, couldn't you just-- - No, I like it the old fashioned way. I'm hanging up my broom. Now, let's go. - I fought a dragon today, I'm not running anywhere. Wait up.

(slow sensual music) - Thanks for asking me. (mumbles) You're a real prince, you know that? - I don't know I'm really classified as a prince. (mumbles) - Well, it counts in my book. Who needs Leonardo Decaprio (mumbles). - That dream, it was you? (slow relaxing music) Hey, what (mumbles) Mercedes? (loud banging) (dark slow music) - Nice dress. - Who dressed you this morning, Calvin Klein? (laughing) - Hey. Where are the cool people, you know, the cheerleaders? - Cheerleaders, you mean chess club, don't you? (simple rhythmic music) - Oh my god, oh, this can't be happening to me! No, no, no! No!
