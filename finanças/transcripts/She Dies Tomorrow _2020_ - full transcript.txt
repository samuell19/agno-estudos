I didn't know you very well. We only knew each other for a short time, but it was a really nice time. That period of time we spent together, it was a really nice time. Oh, my God. It's fucking over. It's over. It's over. It's over. It's over. It's over. It's over! It's fucking over! I'm fucking dying. You don't get it. You don't understand! I'm not fucking crazy. I'm not crazy! Please understand, I'm not crazy. We had a time. We had a time, but it's over now. There's no tomorrow. There's no tomorrow. I'm not fucking crazy! Hi, how's the new house? It's good. I think it's so great that you own a house. This is the best thing you could have done. - Yeah. - Yeah. It's... Hello? Wait, did you just say something? 'Cause I can't... Can you come over? Ugh, I can't. I'm supposed to go to my sister-in-law's birthday party, but I really don't want to go. I just really want to stay at home because she fucking hates me. Okay. What did you just say? Hold on. Are you speaking into the phone? I can barely hear you. Are you okay? Not really. Oh, shit, Amy. I'll come over, if I can, okay? Okay. Look, just pause. Don't do anything you might regret. Go for a walk or why don't you try watching a movie? A movie's an hour and a half. I heard hour and... what? An hour and a half... what? Are you laying down and talking into the phone? Hello? I cannot understand you. Can you talk into the phone? Oh, my gosh. Wait, I'm getting a text from my brother, now. Bring salad? Bring... I don't even want to go to this party. I'm just terrible at making salads. Look, they sprang this stuff on me at the last second and she doesn't even like me when I go over there. She's just mean to me. I don't know... I don't know what I did. Fuck. Amy? Amy! Hey, Jane. What is going on? Come on down from there. I was thinking... I could be made into a leather jacket. This used to be alive. And now I just walk on it and don't even think twice. But in death, it becomes useful, you know? I want to be useful in death. Here, drink that. I don't want that. But I am telling you because I want you to make sure it happens when I die. You are going to die if you keep relapsing. That's not what's happening. But I am drinking, so that's... technically a relapse. Yeah, but... it doesn't matter. Tell me you'll take care of it. Nobody is turning you into a leather jacket. You're not making sense. You're not thinking straight because you are loaded. Look at me. Look at me. I... am going to die tomorrow. - No, you're not. - Yes, I am. - No, you're not. - Yes, I am. - No, you're not. - Yes, I am. - No, you're not. - Yes, I am. - No, you're not. - Yes, I am. - No, you're not. - Yes, I am. - No, you're not. - Yes, I am. It's okay. No, you're not. It's not okay. It just is. So... Tomorrow is another day. I can't sit here and watch you get wasted. I won't be held hostage. So, I am going to leave and you're going to call me tomorrow. There is no tomorrow for me. I have to let go, oh, my God. You know this. There's a guy in Denmark. He's a leather worker, I want... No. Stop. Goodbye. Hmm? Hello? Hello? Hello? Was I dreaming? So, this is gonna be the spare bedroom, but I have to finish wallpapering. 'Cause the previous owners had it this sort of babyish blue nursery color. Extra storage. Good to have. And this is the bedroom... That's a big TV. What, about 50 inches? I don't know, it was the previous owners. They just left that TV? Yeah. You wanna watch something? I don't know if it works. You haven't tried to turn it on? No. I don't really watch TV. Fair enough. That's a big bed. You know, I actually do really regret not going to Majorca one summer because I was trying to win over an ex-girlfriend. Oh, that's sad. I had the whole thing planned out. That's actually a tragedy. That's a true regret, if we're being honest. That's bad. What about you? How you doing in the regret department? - Truth only. - Okay. Um... Go. I regret not knowing how to make an omelet. I wouldn't say that's a regret. I mean, I've tried really hard and failed really hard. Okay, fine. Next. Skip. It just takes a very tiny amount of my brain space, but it's something. I terminated a pregnancy when I was 22. Terminated? I mean, I had an abortion. I know, just the term. I didn't really... I hadn't thought about it until I bought this house. You hadn't thought about... what, the kid? Well, it's not a kid. It's a bunch of cells in my uterus, but... Um... Yeah, I hadn't thought about the kid until I bought the house. Do you regret it? Don't answer that. No, I don't. I don't regret it. I mean, I probably wouldn't have been able to buy this house if I'd had it. I don't know why I'm reacting like this. No, I don't regret it. What do you say we figure out that TV, now? Sorry. What? I thought you said you were gonna bring the salad? I know, but if I come, I'm just gonna be distracted and I just want to sit and play with these ideas. You know I can't control when inspiration strikes. I'm just gonna annoy Susan, anyway. Look, I'll take you guys to dinner tomorrow, or whenever. Tell Susan I said happy birthday, okay? Of course, I will. Will you call me tomorrow? Yeah, okay. Love you, bye. Oh, no way. No, no, hold it. Hold it. Got it. Wow. Wow, this is... Amy, are you there? Goddammit, unlock the door. All right. Amy, I'm really freaking out right now because all that stuff you were saying earlier. What were you talking about? And I can't... Like, now, I don't know where you are or what is going on. Amy? Hey, it's Amy. Leave a message or text if it's important. Yeah, hi, uh... I feel like you put this idea of dying in my head and now I'm paranoid and you're not calling me back. Can you just call me back? And I broke in your house. We're on vacation in the Keys. It's gorgeous and I'm in the water. I got the snorkel gear on. - We were on one of those - You okay? - snorkel tours... - I'm fine. and she refuses to get in the water. - She wouldn't come in. - No, I'm telling you, you guys, dolphins are down to fuck. - Oh, God, here we go. - DTF all the time. This is her new kick, okay? I'm curious what you think of it. I am obsessed with the idea that... Are you expecting someone? No, I'm not expecting anyone. Did you get me a stripper this year? I should have done that. Baby, one year you have to get me a stripper! He always threatens it... Hey. I thought you weren't coming. No, but then I decided to come. Okay. I missed you. Oh, I missed you, too. - No, I missed... - You okay? Yeah. No, I'm good. I'm good. Oh, you put these up. Yeah. Well, we love what you do. We love you. - I love you, too. - Why are you in your pajamas? Yes. Well, they're floral. I don't want to go in. Is your wrist okay? I gotta go see Madison. - I got to go see Madison. - Madison's sleeping. - She's always happy to see me. - Yes, but she's sleeping. - What happened to your wrist? - I don't know. I don't know. Hi, Susan. Hello, Jane. It's her birthday, so. Happy... Happy birthday. She just... She came. Yes, I can see. It's Jane. Jane is here, everyone. Jane, I'm so happy you could make it. Thought inspiration struck. Let's go in and say hi to everybody. Okay? - I'll go say hi. - You're just in time for cake. I do. I love... I love cake. Awesome, we're gonna have some. She loves cake. This is Jane. I told you about Brian and Tilly? - Hi. - Have a seat. Susan was just telling us about her fascination with dolphin fucking. Oh, where you going? Sit down. Take a seat. It's cool. Anyways, yes, dolphins are like sex maniacs. You guys, I'm not kidding you. Dolphins. They will fuck all the time. They fuck around with porpoises, with baby dolphins... Sometimes they'll just kill it. - I mean, it's wild! - Oh, my gosh! They've been known to trap other dolphins in caves to rape them. I can't even! Do you know, I just read the other day that they will bump into puffer fish because they'll get high. You can get high from bumping into a puffer fish. Wow. That's a new fun fact that I haven't heard. I knew their dicks could grab things, but I didn't know they get high off of puffer fish. You love that. No, they get high - off of bumping into things? - Yes! Yes, I'm saying that dolphins, they are, pretty much, just like us. Oh, Susan! They are! Okay, I'm sorry, that's not exactly what I want and how I want to live my life, but we have similarities. Right? It's human nature. Doesn't, Michael Jackson have that song called Human Nature? Yes, he does. Madonna... And Boyz II Men. Love Boyz II Men. Actually, I think it's really interesting, about the dolphins. I like you. She's great. She's great, Brian. Good job. Yeah, she's great. I didn't realize dolphins were so interesting. I know. I know! They are really humans without society. - Jane? - Yes? What's your take on the whole dolphin-fucking thing and how we're not so different than fish? - Uh... - No, baby, dolphins are not fish. Okay, so Jane and I very rarely agree on anything, but I actually think we might be on the same page on this one. You spend all your days looking deep into your microscope, looking at these small images saying, "Oh, this flower is a universe," and I'm just saying that dolphins are human-like and we're all the same, right? We're all the same. Humans are the only animal or creature that pretends to be what it's not. Albert Camus said that, I think. I Googled it. - I like that quote. - That's a good one. - Thank you, Jane. - Wow, we have a reader. She's something, huh? She is. I just... We're all gonna die. I just think we should be able to talk about it, right? I mean, I'm dying to know. She's funny, right? - Wow. - No, she's joking. - She's just joking around. - You don't have to humor her. - You're joking. - Well, it's like, I just have this feeling, the way that you know when you're about to get a cold the next day and it just hasn't hit yet? I know that's what is happening. I'm going to die tomorrow. But how do you know? I don't know. I just know. So, you know it or you don't know it? Well, I know that I don't know. but I know I don't want to be alone and I know that I'm going to die tomorrow. - Well, if you... - I know that I'm going to die tomorrow. But you don't know. I know that I'm going to die tomorrow. I know that I'm going to die. Okay, great. So, you don't know, right? I know that it's my birthday and I want to talk about dolphin fucking. It's all I want to talk about tonight. I don't want to talk about death because I am not that old yet. Okay. You know what? Why don't I go into the kitchen to get that special thing for the birthday girl? No, no, don't go now, Jason. Just stay, now. What? Go get my cake. I'm gonna go get the cake. Oh, my God. I'm sorry, Susan. It's just... something's just terribly wrong and I just have to say it. I'm going to die tomorrow. I'm dying. Jane, we heard you. - I'm dying. - I heard you! Okay? You are doing what you always do, which is make everything about you. It's all about you, Jane, all the fucking time. You sit alone in that room of yours taking pictures of God knows what, because you can't hold a normal fucking job. The only reason I tolerate you is to make Jason happy. And I pray to God, every fucking day, that my sweet daughter does not have whatever gene this is that makes you this way. ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ - I just thought for a second, - ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ when the lights went out, that that was it. - Do you know? Is that it? - ♪ Happy birthday, dear Susan ♪ - Did we... I think that it... - ♪ Happy birthday to you. ♪ Are we already dead? Did Jason ever tell you about the time that we had to take her on vacation with us? Uh-huh. Yeah. She didn't want to be left alone, - so we took her. She got lost. - It's okay. I feel that way all the time, like I'm going to die tomorrow and I got to get everything done today. No. I know. That feeling is just paralyzing. But it's really gonna happen for me. What are you talking about? You don't know that. Yeah, I do. I know it. I mean, just like I know if I drop this, it's going to break. For fuck's sake, Jason! Mom? I know she's your sister, but she has got to go! Mom? Get the fuck away from me, Jane! Jane, man. She's crazy, right? I don't think she's that crazy. She could be right. What? I mean, consider for a second that she's right. We all have to die at some point. Why not tomorrow? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Do you want to get a drink somewhere else? Yes, I do. Just say, for instance, that Jane is right. Why are you always making excuses for your sister? Just listen to me. I listened to you about dolphin fucking. Just listen. Fine. We're all gonna die at some point. Yeah, no shit. We are going to die. I'm gonna die. I could die tomorrow. I'm gonna die tomorrow. I'm gonna die tomorrow. I'm gonna die tomorrow. I'm gonna die tomorrow. I'm gonna die tomorrow. I'm gonna die tomorrow. Susan? Susan? - Susan! Susan! - Oh, God, I'm gonna die. I need to go to the hospital. I love you, Pop. - Hey. - Hey. - Mom? - It's okay. Dad? It's okay, it's okay. It's okay, everything's gonna be okay. Why are you crying? It's okay, it's okay. Are you drunk? Yes, a little bit. I'm gonna die tomorrow. And so is your dad. I should have done this for him sooner. I was waiting for him to die to break up with you. I mean, I was gonna give it three months. I didn't want to be an asshole. We weren't gonna last anyway. I don't want to die. Mom! Mom, I don't want to die now. She did this to us. Who? Your sister. Not only is she killing us, she's killing her. She's killing Madison. What do you wanna do? You know. Okay. There's no nd to leave a message. Amy, please, call me back. What the hell is that message? What are you talking about? I know you know what is going on and you've left me all alone with this. Please. Amy, please, please! You're my friend, call me back. Hey, it's Amy. I won't be around tomorrow. Or any day after that, but feel free to leave a message. Hey, it's Amy. I won't be around tomorrow. Or any day after that, but feel free to leave a message. There's no need to leave a message. All right, let's do it! Do I have to wear the helmet? Uh, yeah. Definitely very important to wear the helmet. You know, these things look like big toys, but at the end of the day, if you hit anything too fast and too straight on, this thing can flip right the fuck over. Well, I'm gonna die anyway. I mean... not here. I mean, not on my watch. Right. But I'm definitely gonna die tomorrow. Umm... I can't hear anything. Okay. But I'm dying tomorrow. Please. Look... I don't think that anything is wrong with you, but if you're worried about catching something, I could easily give you some antibiotics or... No, I don't need antibiotics. You know when you're on a highway, you know, and there's a semi truck up ahead of you and you know, I have to speed up and get past that before something really bad happens? That's what's going on. Or when you're walking in New York City... Have you been to New York City? Yes, I've been to New York City. Right, so in the summer, when you look up and there's air conditioners everywhere, and... you just know one of those is going to pop out and crash down on my head. Or like, when you lock up everything at night, I mean, you make sure everything's locked, but then you just know something really bad is gonna happen. And then you lay down finally to go to sleep, but then you imagine this guy, and his friends, and they're coming... not just to take everything that you have, but to rape you, and kill you. And not just rape you, but taunt you so, kind of, mercilessly that you're going to have to beg for your own... Do you ever ride a dune buggy? No. - You want to? - Yes. We could go now, you can make a U-turn. That's actually on the schedule for tomorrow. Oh, there's a schedule, that's very fun. A lot of people don't think schedules are fun, but I'm glad to hear you think they are, because to me, that's a big part of my life. We're in. Hey. Good job. This place is nice. Wow. So, this is your brother's place? Yeah, but he never uses it. It's great Back door, in case of an emergency. It's good to know your exits. I thought about buying a place out here like this, but I don't know, it felt too isolated. I like being isolated. I don't think you have a choice, 'cause you don't have any friends. That's not very nice. What's wrong with being isolated? Nothing. You know, I know you said you didn't like TV, so I went ahead and removed all of the televisions, in fact, all the entertainment options, so it's just you and me. That's perfect. You mind if I get more wine? No, of course not. No? I don't want to make you uncomfortable if you... That's fine, just 'cause I don't drink doesn't mean you shouldn't. Can't argue with that. Are those for show or do people actually shoot? We can shoot them. Do you like guns? Yeah. You wanna shoot some bottles? No. I don't like guns. Well, you don't have to. We can take that off schedule. Free up some time. To do what? Usually when I come out here, I just eat a bunch of mushrooms. Oh. I'd do mushrooms. Yeah? Just not alcohol. Okay. I like that. You like that? Uh, do you have any eights? Go fish. Do you have any fives? You got a lot? You gotta have a five in there, somewhere. - I don't. Go fish. - Oh, my God. Um, do you have any eights? Did I just ask you that? I can't remember. Do you feel anything? Mmm... I guess colors are a little bit brighter. But I don't, like, see anything. Do you feel anything? Um... I'm seeing a bunch of diamonds and hearts on these cards. I see them, too. - Pizza! - I'll get it. Don't cheat. I have extra cash if you need it. Is everything okay? Craig. Pizza! Is everything okay? What's wrong? November 25th. The day after tomorrow? What do we have to leave a day early or something? It's fine. It's fine, everything's fine. Want some pizza? I can't believe it. I know. You wanna make out? Okay. Ah, I can't do this right now. Okay. Fuck. You just think like, where am I gonna hide? Everything's closet space. I should have built a tunnel or like a lock or something. It's not really my specialty, but I could... I could refer you to... I could refer you to a psychologist. It's just not really my specialty. You all right? It's just, you're really handsome and I... - What is it? - Excuse me. Oh, God, I'm sorry. Wait, wait. What's happening? Oh, God, I don't know. What is it? Can I help? Oh! Oh, God! Oh! Shh, shh. My mother always used to hum to me, would you hum something for me? - Like that? - Mm, yes, yes. Yes, exactly. I... I need to... I need to go be with my wife. You need to... Go! Hi. Oh, hello. No. No, I missed you. I miss you all the time. Taken a long time... Is this how it ends? I just came back to see if this is real. If you were real. I still don't know if it's real. I didn't know you very well. We only knew each other for a short time. It was a really nice time. That period of time that we spent together. It was a really... nice time. What are you doing? The sunrise. It's beautiful. Do you feel different? After what we did? No. No, I don't. Are you mad at me? What do you think? Okay. But it doesn't matter anymore. - Right? - Yeah. I'll go make us some tea. I'm not mad at you. Kinda mad at myself for staying in this relationship for... I don't know, six months past its expiration date. You didn't even show up to my birthday party. My dad had a stroke. Yeah, I understand. I just feel like if you were really into me, you would have, like, texted to say you weren't coming. We can stop talking about this now. Should we wake her up? I don't know. No. No. It's better it happens in her sleep. All the stupid things they used to talk about. Stupid things to be interested in. It was a waste of time. I liked those stupid things you said. Should I open my presents? Yeah. I just wanted to connect to someone. Or something. Who do you think lives here? It doesn't matter. Platypus, platypus it's always so fucking cute. It's so cute. Hi, I'm Jane. I'm dying. Hi. I'm Sky. I'm dying too. Hi, I'm Erin. I'm dying, too. Hey, can I swim in that pool? Do you think these ants are gonna die? Of course. Everything is. Who's mowing their lawn right now? I think I just got my period. It's my last... It's my last period. The women back in the day used to sit in the streams. And the streams would take away all the blood. - For like the whole... - Tribe. And the women would get their period at the same time, too. And, like, so when the Spaniards came and would see the rivers of blood, they would think, "Oh, they're doing sacrifices." Weirdest thing. I love trees. I'm gonna miss them. I'm gonna miss trees, too. Excuse me? Um... Do you do custom work? Like, if I were to bring you... a... a mammal, could you make a leather jacket for me? I can assume that you know the smell of death takes a while. It's something that you learn. We do do custom work. You have to bring in the skin as soon as possible. It can't be rotting. And ideally, it would be good if it was warm. - Okay? - Uh-huh. If you bring the carcass in and it's still warm, I can skin it, and then I will cure it using a salt solution. When the salt solution is done, I will then take the hide and hang it out in the sun to dry. It's a very long process. And it's up to you to bring in the hide in the proper condition. Do you understand? Uh-huh. If you bring it in that way, we can make you whatever you like. What do you do with the rest of the body? I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm ready. I'm not okay. I'm not okay. I'm not okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. I'm not okay.
