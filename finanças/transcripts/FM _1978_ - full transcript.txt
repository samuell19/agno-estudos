Let's get this major piece of heaviness out of the way. Albert Driscoll, vice president of Billings Corporation... The name sounds familiar because you've seen it on your check every week... He's sending us a Regis Lamar. What's a Regis Lamar? A Regis Lamar is a brand-new flunky sales manager. Driscoll's sending him here to turn our ratings into dollars. Oh, man, not again? Give the dude a ride through Bel Air. Buy him a nice dinner. And get him so stoned he thinks he got laid. And send him home first class. Alright, look... I don't think we take it so lightly this time. The guy's got heavy credentials. He's also got big corporations, government, and I hear the army. - The what? - You heard it, the army. Driscoll's sending the dude here to get these big accounts to put spots on our station. Hell, Dugan. We've spent years trying to beat them. Now they wanna join us? If we let them get away with one, they'll start shoving them at us. They'll start overselling, over-commercializing, till they drive our goddamn station into the ground. What do they care about our audience? What do they care about music? All they care about is money. We gonna let them do this to us? - No way! - OK! Case closed! - Let's get onto some good news! - The dope is here. - Are you kidding me? - The dope ain't here. But what is here is a Linda Ronstadt concert that's happening. No way! Carlyle and KLAX have got that locked up. - Oh, they do, huh? - They do. They are sponsoring it. Well, I got a little idea about how we can steal that concert right from under Carlyle and broadcast it live. KLAX is gonna sponsor it and we're gonna broadcast it? - That is pisser. That is pisser. - That's a pisser. Not only that, we're gonna do it without them ever knowing about it. Shit! Listen, Dugan, if you do pull off that Ronstadt thing, I got dibs on MC! - I asked you first! - You got it, man! ♪ Time keeps on slipping, slipping, slipping ♪ Into the future... ♪ Doc, what the hell is the matter with you today?

Uh-huh, not me, baby. It is both carts gone. Well, get on the horn, tell everybody that the next hour is commercial-free. Just music. A present from the friendly folks at QSKY.

Messiah, come to make life perfect for all of us here at Billings Radio Division. Where have I heard that? Oh, excuse me. Eric, sweetheart, how are you? I've been trying to get ahold of you for two weeks. Are you still my agent? I was down in Palm Springs, I had to talk to the ex-wife. What a pain! I tried to call you. What's the problem?

You been sneaking that piece of crap to every station in town. - Come on, Jeff... - Come on, Izzy! - Go eat it, will you? - Funny! I got an appointment with Lt. Reach tomorrow and I need your decision. - Tell him I'm thinking about it. - You're thinking about it? You're thinking...? That account's worth $125,000.

I plan to talk to Reach about a package, putting those spots on all ten of our stations. What do you think? Thrilling, Regis. Maggie? - Maggie? - Hey, Dugan. How you doin', good-lookin'? - Haven't seen you in a long time. - I know. You look terrific! - Let's break this up. - Oh, yeah... Dugan, have you made the down-payment on your tux yet? Because if you don't have that tux, you can't get into my concert. Just think about it. Little Maggie has made this all possible. Linda Ronstadt, live in concert! It's gonna be a biggie, Dugan, and you're not gonna wanna miss it. Wow, Mr. Carlyle, this is a surprise! Can I have a minute of your time...? - I wanna talk to you about that concert. - What concert? Linda Ronstadt. You mean the one that Carlyle's putting on? That's exactly what I wanna talk to you about. - I'm sorry, I don't drink. - How about dinner? - I'm sorry I... - Don't eat? Regis, look, er... See, I make it a practice not to involve myself socially with anybody in this business. Things just stay friendlier that way, you know what I mean. I guess so. Well... That's what makes you different from the others. Would you close my door, please? - You really want it that bad, huh? - Yeah, I want it that bad. Now, isn't that just so, so hot? Yeah, this is Mother telling you, if you find it, or you got it, then you just better keep it. Now, what d'you think about that, hmm? Regis... I've racked my brains over this one, and I just don't see how those army spots fit on our station. But there is a way, if we produce the copy ourselves. Let our jocks cut it. I think it can work. I mean, dig the Prince... "Hey, brother, what's happening? "Now, what's the most important thing in your life? "A foxy lady. "Well, how you gonna get one? "With a nice new shiny uniform, you strut your stuff, man! "It's what it is." Or... Mother: "Hi. This is Mother talking to you. "Tucking you in, making you feel so warm and cozy. "You wanna make your Mother happy? "Join the army." - What do you think? - Terrific. - What about the schedule? - Huh... Well, I don't see how we can put those spots on twice an hour, prime time, and not sound like we're owned by the army. Hmm... Reach would never go for it, not without the schedule. And I wouldn't blame him. You're right, Regis. We'll have to let the army go somewhere else. Huh? We don't need 'em. We don't need Reach. Listen... Listen to that sound, huh? We got the best damn station there is. - That's not the point. - What did you say? - That's not the point! - Well, what is? Profits. - We make money. - Not enough. - Not enough for who? For you? - The company! Screw the company! I promised them a station not a bank. This deal's too big to pass up. I'll go all the way to Driscoll if I have to. Then you better get going. 'Stay tuned to QSKY, my little darlings, 'cos Mother's got a big surprise for you.' - And for Michael J. Carlyle. - Attaboy! If we don't hurry up, he's gonna be welcoming us. Don't worry about a thing, my little pigeon, it's all taken care of. Oh...

Good evening, television viewers, and welcome to "The Eric Swan Hour". Hi... I'm Eric. Just a short while ago, the Big Apple City Council voted their unanimous consent to a ballot referendum that would legalize casino gambling in the city... - 'Jack Rapp here.' - Hi, Jack. - It's Eric. - 'Hi, Eric.' Listen, what happened? Come on, tell me. I'm in a great mood. - 'Er... listen, Eric...' - Uh-huh? 'Eric, what the hell did you do?' What do you mean? 'Don't "what do you mean?" me! 'I mean, I got a call from Schuler himself, the producer, remember? 'He's screaming his head off, he'll never give me another drop of business 'as long as I send someone like you around. 'Are you trying to ruin me?' - Jack, I don't understand, er - 'Don't understand what?' I don't understand what you're trying to, er... tell me... - 'Well, you listen.' - ...or say. 'I have never been so embarrassed in my life. 'Now, Schuler said you would not take direction, 'he said you kept coming up with your own ideas, 'telling lousy jokes, not even relating to the audience, 'walking around as if it was the goddamn "Eric Swan Hour"!'

OK, just shush. What you were just listening to, ladies and gentlemen, was side one of Marcel Marceau's new hit single. Well, it's not a hit yet, but we think it will be. And don't forget, you heard it here first on QSKY-FM. Now back to something a little more traditional. This is Eric Swan. Alright, it was very good. I mean, it was very, very... It was brilliant! Thank you. - Bobby, I can only do that once. - Yes, I know that. - OK. And you can only do that once. - I hope so. - It really was good, though. It really was. - Thank you, thank you. Now do me a big favor. Send Cathy in here, will you? - OK. - Thank you. - Huh? - Bobby, it's not "huh". It's a question. Just have Cathy come in, OK? Well, she's not here. She left. I thought you knew. What do you mean? Thought I knew what? Well, er... she came in this morning and, er... quit. She said she got a better job. With, er... - With... - With who? With Jack Rapp, your agent. We all thought you knew that. Yeah, I knew that. I knew that. That's funny, er... sometimes... ...we file things, you know, and we forget them. - Sure. - I knew that. OK. Thank you. Bobby? Yeah? Erm... Where's Dugan? Well, he went out to lunch with Alice. It's her birthday. Laura and I are going over there now. That's great. OK... OK. - Eric? - Yeah. Are you alright? No, I'm fine. Thanks, kid. Oh, you know those D.J. tapes you did? I'm giving them to Alice. Laura, you know Eric doesn't know anything about Cathy and Rapp. - Is he alright? - Well, he seemed a little strange. Do you hear that? It's not what you think it is. It's a human heart. A very happy sound. You hear this? - 'It's an empty heart.' - See, it's just creative radio, Booby. It's a little strange for creative radio. Well, look, if it'll make you feel better, go get Dugan. - You want me to take him off the air? - Dugan makes that decision. I'll stand here, keep an eye on Swan... - And I'll go get Dugan. - OK. 'Tell me I can love you and you can love me, please. 'Can someone love Swan? Someone?' Come with me, and this'll be our song. 'There. Nice.' It's ours. Who are you? Call me. I don't know who you are.
