Portland's number one station for classic rock. 107.1. The Way Back. Oh, shit. This was my mom's jam. Were you sleeping? Sorry. Sorry. Hey! No, no, no, no. What are you doing? You're gonna kill us both. Oh! Yo. Thanks, babe. I asked for something vegetarian, but she just kind of threw a bunch of sides in the box, so... Hmm. Better have that thing memorized by the time we get to the trail head. Do you have it memorized? You bet your ass I do. Really? Okay. What's, uh, this one right here? That one? It's so easy. Uh-huh. Piccadilly sweet rose. Not even close. It's... Look, if I had it memorized, I wouldn't have to lug that thing around, would I? Mm-hmm. Hmm, looks like we have company. Hey, man. I could take your trash. Uh... Thanks, that's, uh... Yeah, we just started. So, maybe you give us, like, ten minutes? Jimmy. Can I get a hand in here, please? Did you see the red star come down? Okay, come on. What the fuck was that? Here we go. Ready? Mm-hmm. Yeah. It's... We can totally chill in the car if you need more time. I'm telling you though, once we get going, I don't think you're gonna be nervous anymore, okay? This is the fourth time I've done this trail. I promise, nothing scary about it. Okay? It's riskier for you to drive your car to work. Or surfing. Surfing's way more dangerous. You could break your neck, get eaten by a shark. You can... I know that it's different. I'm comfortable in the ocean. I've been doing it my whole life. I... No, I know, but you'll be comfortable backpacking after this. Right? Plus, when we're like 80 years old and we're looking back on all these adventures we had together, you know, Yellowstone or Kilimanjaro or Machu Picchu or something like that, you're gonna laugh about how nervous you were. Yeah. Okay. Yes! Thank you. Great. Here we go. You're not going to regret this. You might. Love you. I was, like, 13. What was her name? Belinda. Oh, my God. It was not Belinda. What? No, I swear it was. Belinda Caldwell. Yeah, on a trampoline in her backyard. Whoa! Yeah. So, who kissed who first? I'd say it was like half-and-half, you know? We talked about it for 20 minutes and it was all very scientific, you know? How was it? Oh! Not good. Just not good, you know? Pressed our mouths together and kind of moved them around a bunch. I do remember thinking, "Why are there so many teeth involved in this?" Like, "Is she gonna try to bite my fucking tonsils out?" Like the inside of my mouth... Shouldn't have... Hey, yo! Let's go. We're burning daylight. Hey, uh... How's it coming back there? It's bad. I mean, it's bad. Do you wanna help me, maybe? Hon, we're trying to attack this thing as a team, you know? I'm doing food, you're doing lodging. With our powers combined, we might make it through the night. Just come over here and try this, all right? We can deal with the tent later. Mm, that's money. Here. Just try it. Huh. Interesting. Is this the first of an eight or nine-course meal or... Let me explain a little something about the human body, okay? Hmm. It works most efficiently when you give it just enough fuel, right? 'Cause if you have too much, then you get sluggish and you can cramp. You wanna keep that needle right above empty. You know? Oh. Got it. Okay, so I'll just kinda eat like this, like... Yeah, you got it. What? What? You're looking at me like a weirdo. What is going on? I'm looking at you super regular. Hmm. How do you want me to look at you? Hey, if you wanna kiss me, just kiss me. All right. Love you. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. What are you doing? It's me, Belinda. I still love you. You know what? Belinda's a good woman. And while that is exactly what the kiss was like... ...she does not deserve this ridicule. And here I think I'm gonna get some tooth-free kiss of passion. Listen, you set up the tent, we can talk. Yeah? Hold this bowl. One minute. Time me. For the tent, not the sex. I'm telling you, this is gonna be, like, 30 seconds. Ruth? Oh, my God. You scared the crap out of me. Sorry, I just... I woke up in the tent and you weren't there. I didn't know where you were. Yeah, I was peeing and then I saw something. Yeah? What? I think it was a deer. Oh, fuck. I thought you meant, like, something scary. It was scary. It was staring right at me. I mean, that's kinda what they do. They just stare on. Are you done peeing? Yeah. Yeah. Almost there. Watch your step. Here we go. This better be good. Yeah, it's something, isn't it? Here we go. Hmm? Um... Uh... You know, six years ago, I just didn't know what I wanted in life. And I swear to God, I met you, and... well, it just felt like all that changed. 'Cause now I feel like I'm going somewhere, you know? And I don't even know where, but I just know I wanna go there with you. You're smart and you're funny. You're curious and, uh... I love you. I love you. So, um, I just wanted to ask if, uh... Will you marry me? Ruth? Ruth? - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. - Just stop. Stop. Harry, I'm... I'm sorry. Yeah, that's okay. That's okay. Harry, you know that it has nothing to do with you. It's not about you or, like... I know, I know. That's okay. No, I know. No. You don't have to say any more. I just feel like a fucking idiot. That's still a pretty damn good view. Shit. Harry. Look, we don't have to do this. I'm sorry, okay? Just leave it at that. It's just... Why did you do it? You knew. You knew how I felt about it. You said that you agreed. You said marriage wasn't a big deal. What do you want me to say? I wanted to scare you off? Isn't this good? I thought this was good. It is good. I want to be with you. You wanna be with me. That's all that matters. All that marriage does is lock you in and you can lose control of your life. Ruth, Ruth, Ruth. We're not your parents. What do my parents have to do with this? Are you kidding? Okay, fine. Um... I think your parents splitting fucked you up more than you'd like to admit. Wow. Nice. I'm not doing this. You're not my therapist. Yeah, right. Like you tell her anything. Excuse me? You tell her what she wants to hear, so you get your medicine. Are you kidding me? You've admitted that. Look, maybe if you were honest with her or you, I don't know, fucking tried, then you wouldn't be so stressed out around this shit. Around what shit? Oh, my God. Ruth, I just proposed to you and you had a panic attack. You're stressed out about commitment. You're stressed out by travel. That is not how it works. You're... I'm not stressed out. You don't know what you're talking about, so just shut the fuck up! Harry, I'm... Dr. Ledlow's office. How can I help you? Hello? Hello? What the... Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa. It's okay. It's okay. It's just me. Whoa. Hey. Hey, it's okay. It's just me. What's going on? Why did you leave... Oh. Holy shit. I was just walking and I found it like that. My God. What could've done that? I don't know. Jesus Christ. What's all that stuff on it? Looks like some kind of fungus, maybe? Is that the deer from the other night? No. No, no way. Do you know how many deer are in these woods? Jesus, you're shivering. Hey. Hey, hey, hey. It's okay. We'll go back to camp and I'll just make you some lunch. We'll relax. Yeah. All right. Jesus. Here we go. "Deer warts or cutaneous fibromas are caused by a papillomavirus. "They are usually temporary "and can vary from half an inch to several inches across." I guess that could be it. But whatever killed it is still out there. Yeah, but it's not gonna bother us. We're too loud, we wield fire. It's not gonna come anywhere close. Look... I don't know what we are right now. But I swear, I'm not gonna let anything happen to you. Okay? Sorry. Harry, you're allowed to touch me. Oh, yeah. No, I know. Just for everything, you know? Honestly, I never even thought about what would happen if you said no. Just how awful that would be for you to have to walk around in the woods with me and... Harry, I'd walk around in the woods with you any day. I love you. Yeah? Yeah, of course I do, you idiot. But... People change, and someday you're gonna change and maybe that new version of you will love me, and maybe it won't. But you shouldn't force anything. What we have is good. It's really good. That's why I don't want to get married. I don't want to mess it up. I've seen what can happen, you know that. I'm with you because I love you. Isn't that enough? Yeah. Yeah, it is. I was thinking of maybe just going for a little stroll. Yeah? You want me to come with you? No, you, uh, keep cooking. You sure? I can finish this up. I'll come with you. I'm going to the bathroom, okay? Oh. You're a disgusting monster. No way. Piccadilly sweet rose. Whoa. What the hell? Ruth! Ruth! Ruth! Jesus Christ. Hey! Ruth. Hey. Hey. Hi. Hi? You've been gone for like half an hour. I know. I was distracted. Thinking about stuff. Okay. I mean, you know, that's cool and everything. I just... You gotta consider the context. You did, like, disappear into the woods yesterday, so... I know. I know. I'm sorry. I won't do it again. It's okay. I'm not trying to... It's okay. Are you all right? Mm-hmm. Okay. Cool. Let's head back, huh? Before the birds eat our breakfast. Come on. Ruth? Ruth? Ruth? Ruth? Ruth? Fuck! Jesus Christ! Are you trying to give me a heart attack? What are you doing out here? Is that my knife? I thought I heard an animal. I mean, that thing's not gonna do much. Good night. You get some sleep? Mm-hmm. You know, Stevenson said he's gonna retire at the end of the year. So, I finish my master's in time, then I'll be on the short list for vice-principal. You know, there'll be other candidates, too, so... Don't get too excited. Should not be a problem for you. I'm sorry. What's that? I'm sorry that I was being weird last night. It's just... I haven't been feeling like myself. That's okay. You don't have to apologize. I know the trip got a little weird. Not what I intended, obviously. I've actually been thinking about that. I know this is probably gonna come out of nowhere. But I think I was wrong. About? About us getting married. Are you serious? Yeah. It's just... You were right. We're not my parents. Whatever their problems were, that's their story. But we should have a chance at our own. So, I don't know, I think... I think we should do this. Are you sure? 'Cause I just don't want to do it if you're not totally... Yes, I'm sure. But there's one condition. Okay. Yeah. I want you to ask me again. But I want us to pretend like it's the first time. Yeah. Yeah, of course. Okay. Um... Uh, yeah. No. Not here. What do you mean? It's so beautiful. Yep. Here we are again. Glad I didn't toss this. You ready? We're really doing this, huh? Ruth Miller, will you spend the rest of your life with me? Yes, I will. Damn, that looks good on you. That is the most incredible thing I have ever felt. I love you, Harry. I love you. No. No, no! No. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh. Viv? Vivian! Oh, my God. Are you okay? She's dehydrated. It's okay. Just take a sip. Mm? Now, what happened to you? I don't remember. I'll call 911. Shit. No service. You know what? We're about to set up camp. Why don't you come with us, huh? We'll get some food in you. Would you like that? Ray? Yeah. Still nothing. I know. Quiet as a mouse. I'm gonna give it another shot. Hey there, hon. You feeling better? We're gonna head back first thing in the morning, I promise. But you, um, ready to tell us what happened to you? I said I don't remember. Maybe you have a campsite close by? What about your gear? You didn't have anything with you. I mean, were you alone? You didn't come all the way out here by yourself, did you? You know what? Forget about it then. You'll remember when you remember. Let's talk about something else, huh? Um... What do you like to do, Ruth? You got any hobbies? I... ...like to surf. Oh! That's great. Us, too. You know, we used to lug our short boards out to the beach here, but the last few times we did, there were way too many sharks. Global warming pushes them all inland. So... Honey, are you all right? You know, I'm gonna go walk out a little further, and see if I can find some service. Get a call out. I think something's really wrong with her. Honey, I don't think we can wait until morning. Okay. Sweetheart... What are you doing with that? Come on, kid. Put that thing down. No. Hey. There you are. Who is that guy? Oh! It's him. Hey, Ruth. What the fuck? No. No. No. Hey. That's close enough. Who are your friends? No, no. We're right here, honey. No, we have to run. No, it's okay. Where are you going? Come back! Last time I'm gonna tell you, buddy. Just stay the fuck where you are! Whoa, whoa, whoa. You're being a little aggressive, dude. All right. You had your warning. Hey. Relax, man. I come in peace. Hey. Thanks for finding her. Ruth? Oh, God. What are you doing? We have to hide. Okay. Who is that guy? Is he your boyfriend? That is not Harry. Hello! Viv! No, no, no. Please. Please, no. Stay. Sweetheart, it's okay. It's just Ray. It's my husband. Over here. Thank God. Are you okay? I'm okay. Well... Well, what about that guy? Well, where's he? Right behind me. Come on out, Ruth. I'm gonna kill her if you don't. Hey. There's our girl. What did you do to her? Her? Oh, don't worry. I can fix that. Watch. No! How did you know? How? I don't wanna die. I saw where you took him. I found the cave. What the hell? Oh, my God. Harry. Oh, God. Oh, God. Ruth! Ruth! Ruth! Jesus Christ. Hey! I saw him. Fuck. The cave. I knew it was too close. What are you? I'm pissed off is what I am, Ruth. I'm a scout. I get to the planet first, then I report back to the others. What am I fucking doing? What am I doing telling you this? Goodbye, Ruth. No, no, no. No. Please. Please. What am I doing? Just do it. Just do it. Goodbye, Ruth. No, no. No. I don't... Please. Please. What the fuck is wrong with me? All the creatures I could stumble upon, I gotta be this guy. Okay. I was better off as the deer. Just do it! Just do it. No, please. I won't tell anyone. I promise. I promise I won't tell. I won't. No. Wait, what... Do I love you? Like, do I love you? Is that... Is that even possible? How the... I love your hands. What the... I love your smile. I love your laugh. Fuck! I love you. I love you, Ruth. No! Wait! Ruth! You don't have to worry. I'm not gonna hurt you. I love you! Oh, it feels incredible! Ruth, let me explain. Okay. I see that you're angry. Get away from me. Hey. Why don't we just calm down and talk about this? This is so us. Look, I understand why you're angry. I killed Harry. But, silver lining, I am Harry. No, you're not. No. I literally am. I'm an exact biological replication of him. All of his thoughts, his fears, his memories are my thoughts, my fears, my memories. Our first date was at the Sherwood Fair. I kissed you on the Thunder Bolt. What? Stop. Stop! Hey, Ruth. Hear me out. I've been so many different things. I thought I felt everything there was to feel, right? It turns out, I realized now, I wasn't actually feeling those things. It was just whatever I was that was feeling them. But for some reason, as soon as I felt love, all of a sudden I was feeling those feelings. And not just feeling the feeling of something else feeling those feelings. Do you know what I mean? What do you want from me? I... I wanna show you something. You know, the craziest thing is, love doesn't even exist anywhere else. It's a singularly human emotion. Like, of all the different things that I've been, none of 'em feel it. Isn't that nuts? Just tell me where we're going. What part of "it's a surprise" don't you get? All right, you know what? You've been patient. You ready? For what? It's a pretty sweet ride, right? Oh, my God. All right. Look, I know you love Earth. I just think a change of scenery could be really good for you. You know, just mentally. Obviously, here you've got a lot of triggers, a lot of stressors, but if we go someplace else, some quiet little planet, somewhere no one will ever find us, we got a fresh start. Bigger thing is, I really care about you, and I just don't want to see you get hurt. There are a lot more like me coming. They are gonna blend in and take over, and they are gonna turn this planet into a place that you don't wanna be. Trust me. I can give you an incredible life, Ruth. I really can. What do you say? Okay. Yeah? Yeah, you're serious? Yeah. All right. All right. That's what I'm talking about. You're gonna flip when you see the inside of this thing. I mean, it looks tight, but once you're inside, it's like a mansion. It's kind of hard... Oh, come on. Are we really gonna do this again? Just get in the ship, Ruth. Oh, God. You've gotta be kidding me. Ruth! Ruth! Ruth! Ruth! You're gonna drown. Come on! You're being ridiculous. Ruth, please! Ruth, what is the endgame here? Seriously. Oh, do not look at me like that. I'm just trying to help. Let's just head back and talk... Oh, my God. Oh, no. I don't understand, Ruth. Why do you keep running? I'm trying to save you. Don't you wanna be saved? You know, it didn't have to be this way. I just wanted us to love each other, Ruth. I was never gonna hurt you. It could have been so easy. But you didn't want that. So I found another way. An even purer form of love. What do you think love is, Ruth? It's desire. Sure, but for what? It can't be as simple as wanting to spend time with someone... Or have sex with them, or share your darkest secrets... Because you and Harry did all those things, and never once did his love weaken. But shouldn't it? Hunger passes when we eat. Exhaustion fades when we sleep. But that's not true for love. That's what makes it so unique. The goal is unattainable. It's two souls desperately wanting to become one. And that is a desire human beings could never fulfill. But I can. I've been longing to see inside of you. All the colors, the electricity, the passion. The love. You do love him. But so much pain. It makes so much sense now. I feel like I finally understand you. Don't worry. I won't let your pain hold you back any longer. I'm gonna live the life you always should have. I'm gonna make something out of you. Goodbye, Ruth. No. That's not possible. What's that? You said you won't let my pain hold you back. But that's not possible because you can't control it. The pain is a part of you. You can't separate it from who you are. If you try and ignore it, it'll just squeeze you even harder. You'll think about your future, but all you'll see is your past. You'll hear them screaming, glass breaking, everything falling apart around you. And you'll remember that's where it all leads. Mom never leaving the house again. Dad drinking himself to death. Which one are you gonna be? Huh? Huh? Stop. Can't breathe, can you? Feel like you're gonna die? Please stop. Stop! Why? I thought you loved being human. You wanna feel everything that we feel. Don't you? Don't you? There's none left. Nothing's gonna save you. You will always be broken. You're worthless. You'll never be happy. What's the fucking point of you? Stop, please. Please. I can't breathe. I can't. Please just stop. Please. Please. Please. It's... It's okay. Hey, it's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It helps to lie down. There you go. Just breathe. There you go. Jesus, Ruth. I knew you had issues, but wow. I didn't know you could be so violent. Do you really think that you can run? I know every last thing about you. You can't hide from me. Or from what's coming.
