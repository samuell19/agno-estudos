Nothing wrong here... Chung! Take a bath and get changed. Remember to lock the gate. Aren't you cold? I am freezing. Shall we go and watch the firework next? You are such a bitch. When will I see you next? Call you. Loser! Brother is leaving. Be back for dinner? Not if I don't tell you. What about sleep? He forgot to turn the hi-fi off again. Leave it, the music is good. But a bit odd, just like your brother. It is classical music. I know. It must be Beethoven then. You are such a genius. When should we go to the moon? When should we fly? When shall we copy the cat? When are we getting high? Climb... Climb up high... Climb... to the sign... Climb... fly me to the moon. Did you write the song? Yes You can go now. Not bad, right? Yes, but it is not where he belongs to. I have got insider's news. A new coach is coming from Taiwan. Sir Mak said he is pretty top. Whoever from Taiwan can coach us. Don't look down on yourself. I just tell the truth. He is here for the Asia Baseball Cup. Just a few months left. Not much he can do. Even Chung said so. We are hopeless. I just tell the truth. I have got insider's news too. A filmmaker is going to make a film about us. What kind of movie? Baseball, of course. What else do you know? Are you kidding? Who would watch a baseball movie in Hong Kong? I will believe it if it is a porn movie. Oh Yes! Your butt is cute, like a porn star. Your butt is more spectacular. Oh You are right. - Indeed! - And it is not faked. Look at your hairstyle. - An AV star's look. - Just like the famous AV star... Let's go to karaoke tonight. Good idea. Better than having buffet. - Ron! - What? Would you like to join? No, I got classes tonight Hong Kong is a strange city. Where you can find anything and everything. From historical relics to modern day gismos. Even Disneyland. However, hardly anybody can tell you... Where to find a baseball. This is a great field. Comparable to those in Taipei. It is newly built... and we have fought a long time for it. Can you see anything special? No spectator stand. It is not prepared for any spectator to come. Not even a homerun wall? There are hardly any homeruns. Besides, it is both a soccer and baseball field Hong Kong's soccer team sounds not bad. Not really. They just lost 0:7 in the previous match. It will make a huge difference if the government can treat us like them. It all depends on you now. When can I meet my boys? No hurry, take a stroll around first. You will meet them in the next session anyway. Alright Daniel! Ron. Hey! Long time no see. You are so handsome now. You look great too. What are you up to? Nothing special. And you? Baseball... Guitar with my band... Really? I am going now. See you. See you. It is your girl. Kevin, could you tell her that I got something urgent? Okay Sir, we have got a special offer for you... May I take your order, sir? Coffee and French toast. - OK - Thanks. Aunt, where is the butter? You are here for the first time? I don't think you are local. I came from Taiwan just 2 days ago. I just can tell you are a tourist. How long will you stay? - No. I came to work - Work? Let me guess. I guess you are either a coach or a model. Cool! I have been both before. I am a baseball coach. See? I see people from different walks of life here. You are seeing many men then? You are bad. The income for a tennis coach... should be cool. It is baseball, not tennis. I don't know there is a baseball team in Hong Kong. May I visit you? We train in a place called Blue Field. Should be there. It seems quite far away from here. We have session everyday, except Friday. You can come anytime. Fine Here is my number. Ping! Aunt is calling me. Get me the bill then. Just go to the counter. Rest in peace in my dream... Rest in peace... Rest in peace... Rest in peace in my dream... Climb so high... You climb so high... You climb up high... you climb up high... "East flows the mighty river. Sweeping away the heroes of time past." West of the ancient rampart is said to be the Red Cliff. Known because of General Zhou of the Three Kingdoms. Jagged rocks piercing the skies, furious breakers banging the banks. As if piling up a thousand snow drifts. The scene so spectacular, like in a painting. "In admiration, numerous heroes came to the fore" "See how the Yellow River's waters moving out of heaven." Entering the ocean, but never to return. See how lovely locks in bright mirrors in high chambers. Though black at morning have changed to snow by night. Let a man of spirit venture where he pleases. And never tip his golden cup empty towards the moon. Since heaven gave the talent, let it be employed. "Spin a thousand pieces of silver, all of them come back" You are white, why do you recite Tang Poems? You are Chinese, why do you sing English songs? Should I buy you some more liquor? Alright, I go to sleep now. Rest in peace you son of bitch. Hey. Boys. This is our new coach, John Tai. He is from Taiwan. Hi everybody. Let's take attendance Jose Au! He will be 15 minutes late. He is just getting off work. Isn't he the captain? Yes, and. He's also my brother. The baseball circle in Hong Kong is very small. Sorry coach, I am Jose Au. I am a bit late. Return to unit! Ron Heung! In a baseball match the willpower of the pitcher, the endurance of the catcher the explosive power of the batter and the competence of the outfielders are all very demanding. So we need physical training. Give me your glove. Everybody follow me. Open your legs. Lower your butt. With your glove in front. Step by step go forward. One. Two. One. Two. Three times around the infield. Okay? Okay? Okay? Cheer up, everybody. Lower your weight! Your glove in front! Hey! Your glove. Very good! Closer to standard now. Lower your glove. Your glove in front! Hey! Lower your butt. Cheer up. Good Coach! Sorry, I am late! Coach Tai, Ron Heung. Why are you so late? Sorry! I sleep late. We are almost finished. You can take a break this time. Remember to turn on your mobile. My mobile... Never mind, I will get a new one. Alright! You can go now! Lower your butt. He is crazy. I can't stand it. He is showing his authority. I don't care, as long as it works. You are serious. You can just be lazy... as Ron. Even if we win the Asia Baseball Cup we still need to find a job. It'd be so cool if we can get a decent job like captain's. You want to be me? I want to be you! You can take a rest after the training. You know how stressful it is working in big companies? He likes to show-off. Just like Chung. What he needs to do at office is surfing the net. I mean it. You won't understand, however. One... Two... I won it. One... Two... My turn. Chips. Julian. - So you know the game now? - Yes. Very simple. You start the game first. You can speak Mandarin. No need to speak Cantonese. Let's start with baseball terms. We'll let you speak Mandarin instead of Cantonese. Baseball! Baseball? My turn. Base hit. Coach. My turn. First baseman. Kenneth. My turn. Third baseman. Coach. My turn. Ball. Jason. My turn... Cheers! Thanks for coming to help us. Hope you can improve our team in... both their techniques... and physical fitness. Since all baseballers in Hong Kong are amateur. That boy is a high-quality player... but a bit arrogant. You mean Chung? He is arrogant... but very competent in match. The one with a hat is the catcher, right? Yup. He is Jason. He is intelligent and a good commander. He is able to lead the team to fight. Enjoy the party? It is cool. But the coach can't drink. How can there be a Taiwanese who can't drink? We are letting him drink one instead of three already. Did you play the game with him? His accent is so funny. Yeah, funny. "Stealing a base" becomes" sleeping a babe" He will scare away all parents. Hey. Look out! We have hit something! A mobile phone? I think I saw a girl. What should we do now? I really saw it. Attention It is raining! The best weather for mental training. Follow me. Mental power training is very important. Everybody call out loudly. Look again! See what he did. Everybody follow me. Very good. Start the game! One! Ready! Start! Two! Ready! Start! Three! Four! Ready! Start! Captain. Keep going. Why are you here? It is raining so heavily. It is raining and our restaurant got no roof... So I got a day-off. Why didn't you give me a call first? I am afraid you will hang up. You don't even know my name. I forgot to ask for your name. May I treat you to dinner, beauty? Let me see if there are better choices here. You should better go to the shelter. And stay inside. Keep away from the fast balls. They are at least 100 kmph. Alright What are you smiling at? Because I am taking the initiative? I thought Asian girls tend to know each other more before they... Make love? This is also a way to know each other more. We are seeking lovers, not servants. You are right. How much do you know about me now? What are you laughing at? Once more... Asian girls usually don't understand their partners. My grandmother's marriage was still arranged by a go-between. The first time they met each other was already in bed. The way you think is quite special. I don't know if I am special. I have no time to care about that. I wonder if I know myself at all. Why do you like me? A roadster attracts me. Your range is huge. You must have had many lovers. Not really. Just an Australian. But he is back in his homeland, after the return of sovereign. You are the third. Only three? Really? Of course. It is so tiresome to cheat. But one-night stands do not count. Aren't we one-night stand? I have missed you for so many nights already. Why do you always sleep during the day? I have to take courses at night. And do homework... And play music I understand. And sometimes... Sorry about that day. Dating with girlfriend? Just dumped by her and got drunk, so... Do you have to take up that much? You can't succeed in everything. But all those are my dreams I can't give up. What is your dream with playing baseball? I want to pitch. To pitch in an actual game I know Chung will be the main pitcher. But I am still not the next choice. Because I'm a junior member. It's all about seniority and it's not fair. How do you know you are better than the others? I don't know. How can I know if I am not given the chance? But I can see Chung is really talented. You have talent too I would like to challenge him. Go ahead. Why don't we go out for dinner for at least once, mom? Don't stop me from cooking. I have cooked my whole life. When I don't cook, I must be dead. Touch wood. It is your birthday today. But death is a certainty, you know? There is a shop selling coffins in Taiwan. With a banner outside saying You will be here one day. That is amusing. I would tell the owner. "I won't die for you" I am not young anymore. What else to care about? Actually, birthday means I am a year closer to death. Why celebrate? You are too much. Brother is coming with his girlfriend. He asked me not to tell you until the last minute or else you will arrange a banquet. There is not enough food then. Don't worry. He will buy some takeout. Hasn't he broken up with that bitch? Bitch? Brother loved her so much. Did you just say love? Didn't your dad love me? Or I wouldn't have you three. But then what? Don't say I am long-winded. Before looking too old and ugly. You should rush to find a rich guy who would marry you. Let him be old or ugly. Don't you ever believe a young guy will be successful and still love you forever. OK, mom, you know I am emotionally unavailable. You mean the bit actor? Bit? He is a pop star. Brother is back. Hey. Put on some makeup. Your brother is silky and you are sulky. You look even older than me. I am afraid they will mix us up. Happy birthday, aunt. She hasn't mixed up. Tits, oh sorry, sis, go put this in the fridge. Yup Mom, this is Meizi (Plum) Plum? The dish ribs steamed with plum? Yes. I am the "plum", he is the "ribs" - Take a seat - Thanks. Meizi is an exchange student from Qinghua University. So she must be very talented. Nope. Aunt you are flattering me Ron is better. I happen to know him. Quite a clever boy but a scatter-brain. His brother is better, graduated from the famous Hong Kong University. But, what a waste, he went on to be a flight attendant! All the men have flown away from this home. When you take Ron away, it will become a nunnery here. Don't worry madam, I can't take him away. I am too short to catch up... with his long legs. Oh, mom. Brother called from London. He ran out of leave for your birthday. He would only call you, as if I am deaf. I don't care if he is in Londra or laundry. He has never thought of coming back for me. I should just put his photo... next to his dead father. Makes no difference to me if he is alive or dead. Mom, you are cursing your son! So you want to be the next one? Or go get a man before I curse them all? One who should leave is staying. One who should stay has left. OK, I will move out once I am married to Daniel. We will get a maid to take care of you. And there won't be a wedding banquet. Don't talk nonsense. You are just an office girl in the record company. How can you compete with his super model girlfriend? I am not an office girl. I am an management assistant. Your sister got big boobs, a gentle heart and strong hands that no man can resist. You want to try my massage? Just regard them as some crazy neighbors. Bye Go get the wine. Almost forgot. Many happiness returns, mom. I would rather many money returns. So another year has passed? I feel robbed. I wonder who is the worse victim then, you or me? I can't understand... Hong Kong people's indulgence with city life. Isn't it nice here? Just the two of us. My friend said this is just like the shore of Australia. Your Aussie lover? He is a good surfer. Why didn't you go to Australia with him? My dad would kill me. He went back to Beijing though. What about your mom? Following her man naturally. Leaving you alone in Hong Kong? All because of my dad. He is proud and bad-tempered. He thinks that Hong Kong people look down on mainlanders. Why must we make a distinction between people? We are all just passers-by in life. Have you thought of going back to Beijing? Nope I am used to the beach front. Can't stand the sandstorm any more. "Once you've experienced the ocean, there's no flow that can be called water." "Once you've climbed Mount Wu, there's no smog that can be called cloud." Wanna do it again tonight? I have got training. Got to hurry back. Well, I will walk you to the station. Let's go to Taiwan. Nope. Only here can I be your first. What am I over there? Strange girl. To care about something like this. Well, I am going. I will call you later. Bye Hey. Why don't you knock? Sorry to catch you on bed. I will come back later 5 minutes enough? 10 minutes? How about 15 minutes? Half an hour. Alright. That will leave you 25 minutes for a smoke. Need a helping hand? Or mouth? Or I can keep my eyes on you. It will be more exciting. Go away. OK! OK! He is weird these days. Sometimes so hyperactive and sometimes just sleeps like a dead. I have found him pretty cute. Have you done that? Done what? The game we are playing now. Of course not. I am not a homosexual. I am not either. But I slept with a girl once when... I was in junior high school. How come? And then? Nothing Since she is truly a homosexual, she kept on with other girls. It is amazing that you would try something so bold. Don't you think that... boys or girls, as long as they are young and pretty, are all very attractive? When you are still young, Why not open up yourself to choices? If you don't even know what you really need. It will be a pity. I am your guinea-pig then? You are my object of research. We are an item then? Don't you dream! Actually, you are not yet qualified. Understand? Right, we will try harder! New mobile? Hello? I am sorry. I nearly hit you that night. I didn't mean to. I was drunk. But I insisted on driving. Are you alright? Actually, I would rather you hit me. You are joking. I really didn't mean to. I am serious. People named that the "Dead Curve" Too bad you still missed me. So you did that on purpose? You are lucky. Or I am lucky that I didn't hit you. I have a suggestion. Let's have a drink to celebrate. Don't bother. Keep it for me. I may call you Ron! Lift up your foot. Stretch out and step on the ground. Hurl the ball when your hand is in front. Not too high and not too low. Come on. Cheer up. Get up steam. Your girlfriend is here. Relax Good Everybody, don't forget I reserved a table tonight. Where? I will come too. - You too? - Yes. Can't I? - It is none of your business. - I don't care. Is this one good? No idea. Any pretty ladies? Manchester United v.s. Chelsea tonight. Will Steven Gerrard appear tonight? He is with Liverpool, idiot. He is the only socceror I know. Pineapple. Watermelon. Watermelon. Peach. Peach. Longan. Longan. Watermelon. Watermelon. Pear. Pear. Tangerine. Tangerine. Pear. Pear. Mango. Mango. Watermelon. Watermelon. Litchi. Litchi! Cool! My fault. Sorry. Continue Apple. Pineapple. Pineapple. Apple. Apple. Pineapple. Drink! I deserve it. Are you thirsty? Lychee. Watermelon. Watermelon. Lychee. Drink! Alright! Green tea. Come on! Oh so green. Apple. Watermelon. Watermelon. Tangerine. Tangerine... Whose birthday? Who? Big tits blow the candle. Especially for you. Happy birthday. Happy Birthday to you. Blow the candle. Why is your name "Big tits"? Everybody saw it before. Only you didn't. Let me show you. Shake it. She is so greedy. Chung is more than our pitcher. He is also a top batter. Do you want to see his big stick too? Show me. Come on. Watch out. Take it off! Come on. She is so eager. Have a look only. Stop it. Please, it is enough. - Enough? - Enough. It is enough. See? Your boyfriend feels inferior. I really don't mind. OK, next time then. Happy birthday! Happy birthday to you. Play again. Are you tired? No. Where do we go now? Happy birthday to you. Drink! Finished already. No more. Are you alright? Last one. Really? I will take care of him. You do. Don't worry. Go home, Mom. Chung is so serious when he plays baseball. I didn't expect he could be so funny. Yes. He is intriguing. He has guts. After all, today is his birthday. Mine too. Do you mean it? Yep. He turns 24 today. I turn 20. What a coincidence. It is like in a movie. Life is a play. Why didn't you tell me, baby? It is no big deal. After all, there is only one cake, and only one you. Me first. Five six pip. Seven six pip. Eight six pip. I said six pip and you follow. No six pip actually. One only. You two gang up. You owe me six now. OK. One more time. What are you doing? Watch out. Jason! Here. See? You just lucky. Again! Again! No look pass. You throw on somebody. You throw on me. - Hey you! - Hey you! You throw on us first. So what? Get away! So what then? So what? What do you want? Hey. Please don't. Want to have a fight? So? - Does it hurt? - A little bit. Here? - How about this part? - A bit. Let me check the other parts. Here? A little bit. I can't imagine we go to the Asia Cup without you. Or a Hong Kong team without Chung. There is no substitution. A very important person once told me: Chung, you have achieved nothing but baseball. That is the only thing I can concentrate on and turn out to be good. That person goes on saying that. If I give up baseball, what is left for me? A life spent in a garage? Only baseball makes me satisfied I have never thought of giving up too. Unless I can no longer move my legs. Even at 40 or 50, till I can hardly run. Even then I may not give up. Actually you are better. At least your family supports you. They always come to see your game. From your childhood till now. Actually, that VIP I mentioned is my mom. Who did you fight with? We don't know. Why fight with someone you don't even know? Coach, they hit us first. Sorry, coach. Wow. Hurt so badly. It is not your business. No need to say a word Ron, get me the captain. Chung is injured. He has to take a break. You come back to the team. And you will coach the lady's team for the time being. Coach you are so nice to me Ron, you practice pitching. Can Chung spare time to teach me? Why don't you join the lady's team, sissy? Resolve it among yourselves. Look carefully. Good! Make an effort to hit. Throw better. One is too much. One is too less. Chung, surrounded by girls over there. Yeah It is surprising that the captain hasn't turned into an eunuch. Does King Chung have time for me tonight? King Chung? Alright. If Concubine Ron needs me, I'll take half an hour to turn down all the girls. I will wait for you over there. Just kidding. No woman can bother men's work. But I need to check with Jason. He usually has something for me. I know I have to fight with him to get you Jason, what's up? You two have business. I leave now. Just the two of us. What should we do? Hurl, of course. You put your arm too low. Put it far away a little bit. Throw it when your hand is more in front. Too far back. Body leans forward, and hands still behind. Forward Relax your hand. I don't understand. Can never throw as fast as you can. So I throw more knuckle balls. That is clever. Your knuckle balls are good. Not easy to catch. I can't play as steady as you do. That is my secret. You treat me to dinner and I will teach you. I thought I had to sleep with you? OK. Let me show you. The secret is... Hero or zero. Want your girlfriend to join us? - You missed her already? - What are you talking about? I think the two of you suit each other. I don't want you to end up like me. All my ex-girlfriends left me because I didn't have time for them. They said that was fine. But the truth was it was not fine. I agree. She complains too. She says she will support anything I do. But she keeps complaining. Yeah. Women, all the same. Is your arm alright? It doesn't bother me at all. I am a right-hander. The stitches will be removed in two days. - Really? - Yep! You teach me how to play then. Me? You should ask him. Him! He is even worse than me. Come on, master. This way? - Bend down! - Bend down? Not this way. Relax your arm. Focus How about the head? Your chin touches the cue. Focus and hit. Right - You almost did it - Yep, almost. Baby, try again. - My legs are painful. - One more time. This one is easier. I understand why. The hair blocks your vision. Let me hold it up for you. Thanks Do it again 1, 2, 3... Too straight. Relax Why do you always pick on him? - Pick on who? - Ron. We are a team after all. Team? No one likes him. It wouldn't help if only I team up with him. We are just team members. I don't want to be his friend. You can teach him. Just need to communicate more. Teach him what? He wants to be a pitcher. You can teach him. I am not a catcher. I am not the one squat down to catch his balls. I can't tell the quality of the balls he pitches. I know. I started playing baseball when I was 10. I don't need you to tell me that. OK. You can talk to him face to face. I have asked him to come as well. Today? Yup! See? I am a bad mediator. I have found myself a loser sometimes. Besides Hong, Jose and you, nobody likes me Jason is a bit too straight forward though. May I take your order? Coffee, please. I envy him sometimes. He has a buddy like you. You don't understand. How shall I explain it? Like the competition in Guangzhou. I remembered that day. We won. Everybody went crazy. "Chung, you were great. Struck out a dozen players." But I know that, without Jason calling the pitches... we couldn't even win. We have been through... so many tough matches. I treat him like my brother. I want to have this kind of brother too. Hi See you. Stay with us. For what? A threesome? See you at the baseball field. - Bye - Bye. Take a seat. So many mosquitoes. Let's move inside. Why come so soon? Afraid of losing me? Look at the arrogant rookie pitcher. Nobody knows my pain though. Isn't Chung taking care of you? I think he is going to fall in love with you soon. I think you are falling in love with him. It is not his problem. Catcher Jason doesn't like me. Look at you big boys. I like you... You don't like me... If you are done laughing, I should go now. I have something to do, join you later. - You can go shopping - Sure. Your heart has gone somewhere else anyway. Go. Just leave. Hey For me? Yes - Thanks - Do you like it? My favorite design. And the size fits? How do you know my size? A woman's instinct. So is Ron aware of your instinct? Again Ready! Good! Once again! Sorry What are you doing? What do you mean? Forget it, just an accident... He did it on purpose. If I did it on purpose, you will be dead now. How can you quarrel at this stage? Where is the team spirit? Forget it. Tired? Yeah, so tired, coach Ron was sleeping on the side room again and daydreaming out there on the field. He shouldn't blame Jason when he was hit by the ball. Since Chung is not here today, he is losing his mind. Do you think... What are you looking at? Haven't seen one before? Go wank. It was your fault and you are blaming me? How can you fight now? Get out and run the field! Jason Hey. You have no clothes on. Pervert Do I like you? If I like you because you are good, what's wrong with it? You stayed in America for so long. Do you know anybody who changes his sexual orientation suddenly? When I was in the marines, some guys made love secretly. But they still kept their girlfriends' photos on their bedsides. That means: yes? You can say it was enforced by the environment. Like in South Africa. The zoo doesn't want to have too many lions. So they separate the male and female lions. And guess what happen? The lion kings fuck each other. Would you call that gay? When we make love, we don't necessarily love. When we love, we don't necessarily make love. I can't tell you can be so sentimental. I can't tell whether you are white or yellow gay or straight either. If you are less observant, everybody will look more beautiful. We should only care what we are. Even that is so difficult for me. Thanks for coming. I didn't expect you to come. I didn't expect you to phone me. So why did you come? I am curious. Want to know if you are alive or dead. What do you think now? Am I a ghost? I am not sure. You mean... I am half human half ghost? I better go now. Wait Human or ghost... I won't harass you. Bumping into each other is also a kind of fate. I will be traveling soon. - Where to? - For a Championship. I play baseball. - Baseball? - Surprised you? Not a popular sport here. I don't know any baseballers in Hong Kong. I don't know any suiciders either. Are you afraid to die? Yes I don't want to die before I have done all I want to in life. You are not afraid, for sure. I face it everyday. Everyday? Are you a killer? More unpopular. I am an undertaker. We're given a discount for our own funeral. An attractive incentive. So you want to die because it is cheaper? Everyone dies one day. Some die earlier. There are plenty of reasons. Breaking up, financial troubles, being cheated. But actually, only one reason will be enough. What reason? Can't find a reason to live on. - Don't you have one? - Do you? I do. Family, friends, baseball. Even baseball? Sure. Baseball is my life. I admire you. You can find so many reasons. Can you do me a favor? Please push me over. Push you over? That is murder. Who knows if I don't tell? If you are afraid of heights, lady, you can choose other ways. This is my area of profession. If one wants to die fast with no way to rescind... This is the best. You are absolutely wrong. What if you hang in the middle? Or even if you make it to the bottom, You fall on a fat lady. She dies, but you don't. Are you helping me or not? Yes I can't bear it any more. Why don't you help me? I don't understand why you have to kill yourself. I just want to find a reason for you to live on. You screw it up. No mood to die now. I said I am not going to die now. I will call you before I die next time, okay? Give me some time. I will find you a reason. Let's see. Don't worry. I will handle coach. You know Chung listens to coach. And Jason listens to Chung. No problem. It seems that nothing can bother you. You are right. Let me put it this way: The old problems, I have solved before. The new problems... are not yet identified as real problems. So the conclusion is: no problem. You are great. What about you? You've lost some concentration lately. What's wrong with you? I had thousands of problems in my life. Father said I have no plans. Brother said I have no guts. Girlfriends said I have no heart and the coach said I have no heart. As for the teammates... When I care, they say I am arrogant. When I don't care, they say I am lazy. I just want to follow my heart. Being true to myself and to others. Why does everyone just want to judge me? Maybe you should think this way: People are concerned about you because you're somewhat talented. If you are dumb, who cares what you do? You may be right. I just want to be a happy and ordinary person consuming my life to the full extent. That sounds contradictory to me. You are what you are. Why bother to force yourself into something great or ordinary? That will only make your life miserable. Look, in this city without baseball, we have played on for so many years and we are the delegation. That can't make us too ordinary, right? Now I know what makes you our captain. I am so relaxed after talking with you. Because you don't love me. Even you are teasing me. Bill, please. Old tradition, eh? Don't worry, dad. I will go with teammates. See you in seven days' time. Don't worry, Sir Mak. Hello How many days off again, Jose? From 7th to 12th, Mr. Kong. Bring back the championship this time. So that I have something to boast to our clients. No Problem. Take one extra day off. Just get the job done. Thanks, Stanley. I will. Thank you mom. A man needs a woman anyway. Although mom is the most reliable person for you. Thanks a lot. If you pay for my tickets and expenses. I can be your personal massage assistant. How about a wet nurse or sex slave? You shit. You have had a long day. We know why we are here. This Asian Baseball Cup is extremely important for us. It all depends on you now. We have trained so hard... just for this Championship. Let's go through the schedule. First round tomorrow against Pakistan. Remember how we lost last time? We were shutout, losing more than 10 runs. Got to be different this time. I don't know why the coach sent such a weak starting pitcher. We lost 6 runs right away in the 1st inning. Thankfully I got two home runs in the 4th and the 5th inning. Can't even believe it myself. Anyway we lost. What a pity. It was so close. We lost to them by a huge margin last time. I did not expect the boys would improve so much, so soon. I shouldn't have held Chung back and should let him and Jason give it a go. We could have won. How stupid! The coach didn't let me pitch even though Chung wasn't pitching. He has no faith in me. Forget it. Good morning. Cable TV installation. Oh my god he is a Daniel too. I will get killed this time. Do you play baseball? Me? I played when I was little. My brother is a baseball player. Really? See you. Bye. Mom, we can watch now. So they just swing the bat and the ball this way and that? What a child's play. Pretty close to the fact. Still looks like a naive game to me. Your son is not as mature as your daughter. So mature that no one has interest in. You are over-riped. Oh, they have to play like that? So close to stepping on the arm. It can be a disaster! I hope he lose the match and get back as soon as possible. Between you and me only. Don't let him know you have cursed him like that. The results in the first two matches are quite as expected. You guys did a reasonable job. We have big battles ahead. The match tomorrow will be critical. Take a rest after the breakfast. Prepare us the best to beat them. Okay? Curry day and night. Curry food and shit. Do I smell like curry? How can I tell when my whole body smells like curry too? You see. I can hardly swallow any more. I have cup noodles. Cup noodles? Great. We will boil the water right away. Cup noodles! Curry? Curry again? Curry seafood noodles? What country are you from? It is still noodles anyway. And their spiked-shoes. Unbelievable. With those equipment we are sure win. Right. We are sure win. What do you think, captain? It depends on you. Me? The next two teams have been champions before. But the coach seems to believe we could win. - You don't believe it? - I do. But remember how we lost last time? Last time? I still remember how we lost in all the previous times. But if we can win once... Just this once... We can wipe out all the loses. You are so determined this time. Of course. I am not young anymore. Close to thirty. I am not sure how long I can carry on. Sounds like you will retire after winning it? The future is hard to tell. As the saying goes, A gentleman has a lifetime's concern but no one day of worry. What exactly are you saying? It is Mencius. Told you to read more books. I read many comic books. We are going to win. Really? What's that? Congratulations. Hey! No... Congratulations. Got something to tell you tonight. Hey... Our efforts are paying off. Let's perform another miracle tomorrow! Beat the Indonesians! Why being so mysterious? Just want to congratulate you alone. Congratulate me? It is not all about me. It is the team and you are a part of it. I was like a prop. Didn't play much. Just got to steal a kiss from you. You overdid it a bit. All the guys were there. What if it was Jason who kissed you? What if it was Meizi? At last you are getting to the point. I didn't mean to conceal anything. I intend to have a talk with you after the match. That day Meizi said she has some kind of feeling for me. But I... But now the point is... both Meizi and I have feelings for you. You feel for me? Hero or zero, you taught me. No. I can't. You can't? You don't even know what it is about. How do you know that you can't? I know... I don't know. I cannot cope with that kind of thing. I have no idea. Then learn about it. What the fuck is there to learn? You pervert. No wonder Jason said you are sick Jason? You two walk together dine together play together drink together going to the men's room together and even dress the same. I just say a word about feeling for you. And you call me a pervert. How do you know Jason has no feelings for you? Sorry, I shouldn't say you are a pervert. Anyway leave Jason alone. As for you and me... Impossible. If you dare to say it again, we aren't even friends anymore. - About Meizi... - Enough said I got it. Go away. You still want to be a pitcher, right? Let me tell you: When I am on the field, I won't think of women. Not to mention men. Look at you. It is not the way to go. Chung I am sorry... Hey, you don't have to. Let's win the game tomorrow and talk about it later. Wake up, Chung! We are late. Chung! Wake up! It's time to go. We are late. It's time to go. We are late. Hurry up! It's time to go. Hurry up! This is the last match Sri Lanka is the weakest link. Never won any game from us. If we win, we will be 4 win 1 loss. At least the runner up and even the winner. That will be our best result of all time. We could even move up to compete in the A-League. Against teams such as Japan, Korea, China and Taipei. To many of us, It is a fairy tale and our dream will come true today! However... Take it easy. You have done your best and that is good enough. How is your foot? Alright? You are great today. A game is a game. Sometimes it is just out of our control Kenneth, don't cry for long. You are still young and have many chances. We will try again next time. All guys listen and remember. Pick ourselves up from... where we fall Jason, you are the one who work the hardest. It is me who disappointed you all. Where is Kevin? Moved out? He... Back to the States? He overdosed. No You are kidding. You got mail. "Ron, I am already too far away." Don't ever think of catching me. When I first tried it, it is only because of one reason: Lack of confidence. Then I realize that these are roads like mountain streams. One wrong step brings you to a point of no return. Hope you won't follow my steps. Using a big problem to solve a small problem. Live your life to the fullest before coming to meet me. "Well... You may just give it a try when your days are numbered."
