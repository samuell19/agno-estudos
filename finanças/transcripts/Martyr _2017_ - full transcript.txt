Nice. Come see your son. Yi! Hassane, get up you're late for work. Right... his work. Get up. May God help us. Get up. Get up! Easy on him, Abu Hassane! Get up, son. Get up. Tell us what happened. We're back to square one. Where am I going to find him work now? He can look... Yeah. You're so optimistic. You, get up... fix yourself up! I'll take you with me to see Hajj Mustapha. Maybe he can help. You want me to work for Hajj Mustapha? Not for him! But maybe he can help get you a job at the school cafeteria. Enough. I don't need his charity. - I'll look for a job myself. - Enough. He'll start looking today. Come have some coffee. I'll get you a cup. They were humiliating me. Son, you can't be that sensitive. Work is responsibility, not coquetry. You can't hide in your little group of friends every time you face something difficult. What do my friends have to do with anything? I'm telling you I can't stand the insults anymore. Ah, because you're the governor of the central bank, right? Your degrees are crowding our wall? You will never get any where with this ego! Let's go already, you've spent all our water. Your father went to see Hajj Mustapha. I'm making lentil stew today. Don't eat out. Finish your search and come back immediately. Batul brought us pickles. May God show you success wherever your turn. Where will you go first? To the sea. My son is going to the sea. Mama... Hassane, you're not a child anymore. You have to shoulder some of our responsibility. I know. By God, I know. Tomorrow I will start shouldering your responsibility. But right now I'm in a hurry. In a hurry, yes. I'm tired. You're making me tired. Go, do whatever you want. Leave me alone, mama. Seriously, let me be. This is exactly what I'm doing. Bye. Saying hello is an act of charity. Peace! How are you, Mahdi? Thank God. You? Everything OK? Do you need anything? No, thank you. We haven't seen you in a while. Have we done anything to upset you? Not at all, with all my respect. But I've been working, brother. It's OK, brother. Yalla, go have fun. But come back and see us tonight. You'll find us here, as usual. God willing... What's wrong? What happened? Nothing. I fought with the asshole again. Oh, man! You got me all worried. It's OK, we'll find you another job. I would ask my boss, but, I'm barely hanging in there myself. I'll be screwed if he found out I'm going to the beach today. Love you, Abu Hmeid, I have no one but you. Man, I'm really upset today. The salt water will melt all that away. Make me some place. What, where's your bride? Shut up, the police confiscated it yesterday. I barely escaped with my skin. Not worth your dick, Abu Hmeid. Let's move. Fuck our lives. Stop nagging, at least you have a job. You know what? Fuck my job as well. God, no one is happy. Look at that dick Khodor. He's cheating. The little brother of a whore! He may be small but he gets his way all the time. He's your upbringing, brother. True. I do love this kid. You love him? Or you love his mother? Hey. That's not proper, bro. Don't talk about her like that. Why? What am I saying? But fuck your life. She should have been yours. What are you babbling about? I was too young. She needed help raising her son. She needs a man, someone to pull her up. Not a guy like me. Really? So it's not because your family didn't accept a widow with a child? No, man! I would have quit my whole family for her. - Go. - Yeah, bite it. Go for it already. Are you seriously cold? This one. What, what, little girl? Hand off, wleh. Come here. Go crazy, jump! Go crazy, jump! Go crazy, crazy... What? Nothing. What's wrong? No. Nothing's wrong with me. I saw Mahdi today. I felt so bad for him, man. Mahdi!? Why would you pity Mahdi? I don't know. I saw the whole bunch of the them today. And it was like, I don't know, like they tough I was better than them somehow. Why would they think that? What am I better at? Have you lost your mind? Of course you are better. If my dad didn't pull me out of their midst, I would have been one of them. Then you should be thankful to your dad for that. Yeah, I'm so thankful. But I wish when he removed me, he'd put me somewhere else. He doesn't want you to be like them. You really think we're better? Look at our circumstances. True, we're not on the street, but we're not at work also. And what work! And then, have you forgotten your situation? Give thanks to your lord that you're not in jail today. And for what? For not affording a leg like. I'm not saying we have a great situation. Of course not, because it's maddening. Shut up, we're living like animals, man. Aren't you overdoing it a bit? And then, what the hell, Hassane, you sound like you are envying them. Yes for sure I envy them. Those people have conviction. There's no... Of course, there's no... Because there's no... Look, Mhammad. Just because you have personal problem with Mahdi... First of all, it's not personal. And then, Hassane, those guys are stupid. No, they're not. They're simple maybe. Or unlucky. Just like you and me. Brother, what's going on with you? Do you get scared sometimes? The one who would scare us can't be alive, my brother. Brother, I get scared. I'm always afraid. Afraid of work, and afraid of losing it. Afraid of going back to the street. Afraid for my parents, and afraid they'd never let me be. And you ask me I envy those guys? Of course I do. At least they're not afraid. How would you know? Brother, at least they have no worries. The guy's they're living day to day. Looking forward to a new war maybe, yes. Or to become a poster on some wall. Yes, maybe. At least they have something. What do I have? They have glory, and heaven. What do I have? My parent's living room? What do I have? And Samah's lentil stew. And Batul's pickles. So yeah... Nothing's wrong with me. Nothing out of the ordinary. Watch and learn, Ali. Get off my back. - Yalla. Jump! - Go. Come on, guys. So? Is it today? No, not today. Not ever. You're such a Beiruti. Eat shit, wleh. Beiruti has nothing to do with it. I just get dizzy at heights. What if we do it together? What am I, your girlfriend? If you were I wouldn't jump with you. Because you don't have one and you'll never have one. And you know, because you're the relationship expert, right? True. Why lie. Let's go. And you, come watch, maybe you'll learn. Why don't you dive, I'll stay here and catch you. I'm not going up. I want to swim a bit. Fuck you, don't come. I'll swim with you. Yalla, race? Get up, wleh. To the rock there, and back. Count it. 1, 2, 3. Where to? You're totally stupid. I'm not gonna climb this thing. OK get out of there, meet me on top. Hamada... It's too late to change your mind, brother. Is the package gone? - Is it still functional? - Shut up, wleh. You hero! So? Nope. Forget about it. So let me ask you something. How difficult do you think this dive is? OK... What if I start from here? Or... from here. Brainless. Someone please pull him up. He's drowning down there, someone pull him up, please. Hassane... Hassane... Hassane... Hassane... Get up, wleh. Enough fucking around, what happened? - Get up, stop fucking around. - Stop... What's wrong, wleh? Are you crying? Don't you dare cry! What happened to him? Toughen up a bit, what's wrong with you! Enough already, let's go. Get up, wleh, get up. Get up. Help me with him. I'll help. Yalla, lift with them. Easy on him! Slowly... Keep your hand there. Keep holding his head up. Take care of him. Someone hold him up, take my place. Frontally, turn around. Hand him over, guys. His arm, his arm. - Take his arm! - Oh, God. Easy. I got him. Easy, easy. Hand him to me. Yalla, 1, 2, 3. Let's carry him. Oh, God. Someone take my place. Lord, help us. Careful. Grab his arm. Come this way, this way. Raise him. - Oh, God. - Here, here. Raise him. - Careful his back. - Muhammad, get up there. Raise him. Someone take over. - Come this way. - Easy, easy. - Raise him up. - Easy! Raise him up! Slowly. Here, here, hand him to me. Watch his head. Easy. Say God's name. God! Careful. Are you his friends? What are you waiting for? Take him to his mother! May God be with you. - Where to? - Khanda' Al Ghamee' - You have to tell me how to get there. - I'll show you the way. Which way do I go? Stay straight. Straight. Up the hill. Keep with him. Stop it. Stop it. - Stop it, brother. - Take refuge in God. Stop it, Mhammad. Enough. Someone stop this guy. Don't let him jump. Stop it, my brother. - Go, go, go. - Red. It's OK, go. Turn here. Your left. Take that! Hassane! Hassane, what happened! What have you done to him? He drowned. God is greater! God is greater! God is greater! - Carry him, let's take him upstairs. - No. We will carry him. - Who are you, you dick? - Mahdi! I am Mhammad. - Don't you recognize me? - All right, all right, enough. Come, son, help me and let's all take him to his parents. Abu Hassane! Hadi, Hadi, Hassoona died. Hassoona died. Abu Hassane! Abu Hassane! Hassoona drowned and died. Abu Hassane! Abu Hassane! Abu Hassane! Abu Hassane! Abu Hassane! Mama... Mama, look at me. Look at me. Why won't you see me? This one's a martyr. Don't cry, Em Hassane. Oh, Mother... Crazy! You're all crazy! Everyone outside. Leave us alone. Oh, and Oh, and Oh. Over the separation of the young ones. Oh, and Oh, and Oh. Over the separation of the young ones. I would destroy homes, and build your lament. I would destroy the houses, and build your lament. Oh, and Oh, and Oh. Over the separation of the young ones. Oh, and Oh, and Oh. Over the separation of the young ones. Dark times, my son, - Dark times... - Hassane. separating loved ones. This is Hassane, mama. Dark times, separating loved ones. May God have mercy on his soul, and make his resting place in heaven. Alfatiha for his soul. (Reciting Alfatiha) The young men are Hassane's friends, Hajj. Come in young men. Grab t-shirts from the table. Abu Hassane, a person is honored with hastening his meeting with his Lord. Of course. May God reward you, Hajj Mustapha. Don't fret about a thing. I spoke with Sheikh Abdel Amir, and he is coming for the washing. But he's a martyr! A martyr is not washed! - He will bring everything for the washing. - But he is a martyr. Isn't he, Hajj? Yes... martyr. According to Sharia, he is a martyr. But... not a blood martyr! A blood martyr is not washed. Because, his blood is his witness on judgment day. But a drowned martyr... is washed, and perfumed, and prepared to meet his lord. Sheikh Abdel Amir will bring people for the washing. - Unless you would prefer to be there. - No. His friends. - But maybe Sharia doesn't allow this... - It's OK, Hajj! - Where from, by God's grace, are the young men? - It is OK, Hajj. The young men are his life's companions. - But... - Allow me this one, Hajj, may God keep you. Let them grasp at the meaning of life. Peace be upon you! And upon you, peace and honor. Welcome, Hajj. - Please have a seat. - May God Redeem you. The young men are my boy's friends. They were with him when... May God take him into his heavens. Good evening to you, whom on one has said good evening to... Are you still holding your promise? Or did others make you forget? If they cut me with a sword's edge, I will not forget you. Old friends, like brothers, you and I. Your mouth is like sweets; inside it, the honey is stored. And why, my heart's desire, are you frowning at us? Roses laugh for you and daffodils smile. Good evening to you, the first one to ever love me. You whose passion is my confession and your love is my religion. And I have prayed to my creator, the lord, to give me... sleeping in your arms, with your hands as my cover. Sleeping in your arms, with your hands as my cover. Strange. When I saw him this morning, I was looking right at him, and still missing him. I told him to pass by, and hang out with us tonight, but I don't think he wanted to. Yes, he did, he was talking about you all day today. You meant a lot to him. My son. My heart is spent on you, my son. May God help you endure his separation. God has honored you with a martyr. Martyr! My son is a martyr. What a I getting out of this martyrdom?! Let Him take it and give me back my son! Forgive me, Lord. But I don't want it. What would I do with it? What would I do with it? - I implore you, Lord. - I beg your forgiveness, God! Ask forgiveness from God, Em Hassane, you shouldn't go down that path. I implore you, Lord. Grief has taken over the city. And dressed its stones in black. Made its sky's planets disappear. And wasn't satisfied, so it took its moon. A human in this world is for safekeeping. Everything on this earth is decaying. The lion has left the den. But the jungle is still full. Grief has taken over the city. And dressed its stones in black. Made its sky's planets disappear. And wasn't satisfied, so it took its moon. In the name of God! Ali... This is Hassane. Get up, dear. I can't cry. Why can't I cry? I want to cry.
