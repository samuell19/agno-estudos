Claire, I'm sorry but we're not allowed to talk to motorists. Elaine, it's so good to see you again. By the way, It's my child's christening, here. Please come. Okay, I will try. You won't try because you'll come and I'll wait for you. Okay. Thank you. See you. [Radio chatter] Wait a minute. [Radio chatter] Brother. Lumen. What brings you here? I'll be bringing mom here tomorrow. What? Why? I can't take it anymore, brother. I give up. It's your turn to take care of her. Lumen, you know how poor we are. My wife and I are both working. But you have different schedules. She's here by day, and you can do the nights. She doesn't have a place here. What are you saying? Your place is bigger than ours. Brother. I'm tired. Should I be the one to always take care of mom? Give me some time off. You're out of money again, aren't you? Don't worry, when you bring mom over, I'll ask Elaine to give you some. Hi. [Our time now is six thirty in the morning...] Orly. You're here. We're like playing hide and seek. I'm tired. I'm not yet tired. What are you doing? Why? It's not waking up. Orly. Don't do it. Let's try again. Nothing. Tell me you want this. I want it. Tell me it's good. It's good. Tell me you love me. Orly. I love you. Lumen came here last night. Why? She plans to bring the old lady here. Another burden. Don't talk like that. She's going to be a burden for us here. Orly, she's still your mom. When will she arrive? Maybe later. I'll go. Take care, okay? I'm sure you'll be glad this time, Vivian. We're able to implement all the modifications that you suggested We're able to implement all the Demanded, not suggested. Of course, that's what I meant. Sorry, Roy. Sorry, Miss Dominguez. That traffic was terrible at the highway. Well... Perhaps, you should've left earlier. We've been waiting for you. Why don't you show Vivian to our penthouse? That's what I'm here for. Shall we? i just... love your hard hat. We've removed the supporting columns at the middle So that you'd have a complete view of the penthouse. Yes, this is exactly how my late husband envisioned it. Foreman! Yes, ma'am? Take your lunch break. - Yes, ma'am. Boys! Boys! Boys! There are also improvements on the next floor. - Break time! Break time! Inclined with your request, last meeting, two weeks ago. The soundproofing's good, the materials are superb, for the ceiling. What are you doing there? Sir? We'll be late for the delivery. You're too slow in loading up. There was just a lot to load. Excuses. You have too many excuses. Son of a-- Hey! You should drive carefully! You weren't thinking! Stop it! Stop it! That's enough! You're such an animal. Even Misis Dominguez fell for you. I'm juicy. But she's our client. You should at least treat her with some respect. You said, make our clients happy. Well, she's very happy now! Oh, Lumen, come in. Mom. Thank you. Bless me. God bless you. Mom. Be careful. Over here, mom. Here are her things. Thank you. May I have a drink? I will get you something to eat. - No, thank you. Nobody's looking after the kids. I'll go ahead. Take care of her. Lumen, just a minute. This is from Orly. Thank you. Take care of her, okay? Mom. Get along with them. Try not to be a burden to them. Yes, my child. Have you eaten, mom? Not yet. Elaine, I'm really sorry, if I'm going to be a burden to you and Orly, okay? Mom, don't think about that. The best thing is, I have somebody with me now. It's really sad to be alone. Orly. Mom is here. I was thinking... Let's put the bed here then cover it with blankets. Can you see any other bed here? Then we'll buy one. A mat will do, Elaine. I can sleep on the floor. Where are you going? I'm going out to buy a folding bed! What are you doing? It's late at night. I was looking for the bathroom. Why didn't you tell me? You know that you're blind. I'm really sorry Orly. I didn't want to wake you up. Let's go. Are you awake? Yes. Elaine's not here yet. I'll be late. Why don't you go ahead? I can't leave you alone? I can manage on my own. Just sit tight. Wait for Elaine. Don't worry about me, my son. I'm not worried about you, but the things here at home. I'm leaving. Elaine? Is that you? - Yes, mom. Has Orly left for work? Yes. He couldn't wait for you. The traffic in Sucat was terrible. Was he angry? My fortune plant's starting to wilt. I've watered it enough but it's still not growing right. Maybe... it needs sunlight. Why don't you bring it outside? Mom, if I take it outside the people around here will just ruin it, they don't care about anything. Well, instead of having it die here inside. Sorry, I don't have loose change, is it okay? Don't you feel sleepy at this time? A little. Hey. Sorry, Miss I can't help it. I'm Miguel. And you? Let us always remember that women should submit to their husbands. Elaine. And the husbands should... Hey. - is to love their better half. No matter how hard I try for our family he doesn't notice. Why? I'm also exerting effort. Let her talk. Sometimes I can't help but think. Of what? Whatever. That's one thing you shouldn't do, Melba. Or else I will kill you. Edgar. Listen to what Melba is really trying to say to you. She is seeking love from you. You know. We can easily give in to temptation. If we hide our frustrations. That is why communication is very important. But communication won't be effective if we can't learn how to listen, without passing on judgement, or without anger. I really don't know why we have to attend this. It's really depressing to hear other people's problems. Orly. Why don't we consult Pastor with-- What? What? Your problem. What's the problem there? You know, you have to watch porn to have an erection. What's the problem with that? That's what I prefer. What's your problem with that? Nothing, it's just that, You can complain if I can't satisfy you anymore. Okay? Sir. Hey, Jerry. Okay. How are your babes? They're fine, Sir. Your dad called yesterday. He was very angry. He's hypertensive. Miguel. You're not a teenager. You're a twenty four year old drop out. You need to learn about responsibility. One day, this company will be yours. Shut up. You're not my dad. But when your dad's still alive, it's my responsibility to train you. Just run the company and give me the profits. That's my only interest. Hi. Hi. You know, everytime I see you, you look prettier. You still don't want to tell me your name? Elaine. Elaine, finally! Nice to meet you, Elaine. Elaine? Elaine, is there something burning? Are you feeling sick? Oh, no mom. I'm actually feeling great. Take care of that. Please be careful. Miss, can I have a glass of water? Finish up then go right to the side. Thank you. Thank you. Here's your glass. Who do you think owns this? Maybe a government official. Or a drug lord. Or a mistress of the President. Orly. When can we have a house like this? It's really big. No matter how hard we work, we'll never have this. We will die beggars. Seems you're going home very late. I just woke up since I'll be sleeping late tonight. Why? Because I want to get to know you better. That's not happening. My work is until morning and we have a vehicle service. Just tell them that somebody's picking you up. There's another car behind you. Please? I don't know. I won't leave not until you agree. Okay, we'll see later. Please go. I'll wait for you at the parking lot. How's work? It's fine. You know, I was feeling nervous while waiting for you. Why? Because you may suddenly change your mind. I'm not used to go with... To go with strangers? Because you might think of something else. Do you really want to know what I'm thinking? What? That you're the most beautiful woman that I've met. Liar. That's true. In fact, I'm so happy that you are with me now. Miguel, I hope you won't think that... I know that you're not like that. Miguel. I'm already married in case you don't know. I know. Ever since, I've noticed. In that case, Why? Elaine, I just want to be close to you. I just want to know if we could have a chance to be friends. I don't know if I can do that. It's okay. I can wait. Son of a bitch. Four... Elaine? Mom? Elaine? Orly just left. He's angry again. Mom, I was stuck in traffic. Wait a minute, what are you doing? Because, I'm trying to memorize the area in my mind. So that I could do some chores. Mom. Don't mind it. I can do it. It's really hard to just sit down. Okay, Mom. Just don't get yourself overworked. I'll just prepare our meal. I'm leaving. Wait! Miguel, Miguel! Please give Marge her cellphone. She left it with me earlier. - What? It's out of my way. I'm on a different route. Come on, it's just fifteen minutes of your time. What's the big deal? Thanks. Are you going to eat? It'll be ready in a while. What time did you get home this morning? My son, You've just left then. You know, I'm always late for work since I'm waiting for you. You do know that it's traffic at the highway every Monday. Special delivery. My hero. Come in. - What? I still need to go somewhere, Marge. Don't be a stranger, have a drink. Come on. Yes? Honey, yes, he was here. Come home early, okay? Bye. Should I feel guilty to Roy? Why? You're doing it to me, not him. And we're so good. We're the same. Don't worry. I'm pregnant. No harm done. By me? This is Roy's. You're early. The driver was fast this time. You're just in time. The old lady's still asleep. Orly, please don't. Orly. -Come on. Orly. Orly, please I don't want to. What's your problem. Orly. You weren't like this. Orly please. Orly. That's enough. - This is what I want. It's degrading. Orly, that's enough. Please be still. Don't move. Son of a bitch! If you don't want to, then don't! I'll look for someone else who does! Son of a bitch! You son of a bitch! You're an animal! Bastard! Son of a bitch! You're complicated! Bastard! Has Elaine gone to work? Yes. My son. I really don't want to meddle with the both of you, But-- - Mom, if you're going to give me advice, forget it. I just wanted to help. You don't have any right to give us advice. Up to when should I pay for the sins I've done? Miguel. I don't want to go home now. Where do you want to go? It's up to you. Have you called her office? She left at five o' clock. Maybe she just went somewhere. She doesn't have friends. Elaine? Bless me, Mom. Where have you gone? We were so worried about you. I just went for a stroll. To cool down. Have you eaten? That shouldn't be there. - Yes, sir. That shouldn't be there. It needs to be taken out. Since we'll be finishing up next week. - Okay, sir. Do you still need manpower? Yes, sir. If you need it, get some more. Okay, sir. Roy, I'm sorry bro. Good morning, sir. - Hey, take this. Okay. Organize our equipment. Emergency with a woman? You got it, It's our first time and I can't let it pass. Where did you pick her up? She works at a toll booth. Who's next? Lady traffic enforcer? Street sweeper? She's different. She's married, but it seems like her first time. Extreme! You're not afraid to get caught by the husband? That's where the thrill lies. Let's eat. Call mom. Let's eat. What's that? You were absent last night. I can be absent anytime. Where did you go? Nowhere. Just places. Were you with someone? Elaine. Whatever your problems are, just talk about it. Mom, I don't have any problem. Hey! Pestering kids. I was seventeen then. Poor. But ambitious. I stopped dreaming when I met Orly. I decided... For him to be the only man... For me. My perspective... Became better... For two years... Content. I submitted to him. More than a cat would do. But now... I just want to be wild. I want to experiment. Tell me. This is what you want. It's what I want. Tell me it's good. It's good. We might crash. I know you can handle anything. You can't help it. That's right. We will be going to a Christening. Miguel, I'm sorry. Promise, I'll see you. Next time. Okay, bye. Mary, here's my payment. Thank you. Let's go, I'm hungry. Cutie, cutie. Just put it there. Elaine! Claire! - Hi, there! Congratulations! - It's great that you've made it. Hon, she's my high school best friend, the one I told you about. - Hello, nice meeting you. - Hi. - This is Abby. - Hello, Abby. - Look they're here for your party. Hey, Orly, their child is beautiful. Oh, this is Orly, my husband. Hi, Orly. [Claire] Excuse me, Camille! Camille! [Dad] Just a minute. [Dad] Hello. [Guest] She's so big already. [Guest] Let's go over there. [Dad] She's already three months. - Hi! Eat plenty so we could at least make up for the cost of the gift. Orly. I'm going to the rest room. Hurry up. You might run out of food. Wait! Wait! Somebody might see us! There's nobody here. Hurry. - Is it good? Sit down. Somebody's here. Sorry for waiting. What took you so long? I've been waiting for a long time. Why is your skirt wet? I'm having L.B.M. It got on my skirt so I had to clean it. You're gross. Maybe their food's spoiled. Somebody was having it too at the Men's restroom. Come on, let's go home. I might have another episode. Come on. Let's hurry. It's so hot here. The taxi terminal is far from here. We'd be taking the jeepney. It's too expensive to ride a taxi. Bro, it's Elaine. - She's flawless. -Beautiful. Bro. - She completes my sexual fantasy! - Great! Her complexion is perfect! - Yes! - She's like the rays of the sun! All of you... If you'll stare, just stare. Don't be vulgar and let me hear it. Just look. What? That's good for one week. And as for you, Tuknoy... Too bad your girlfriend doesn't have this. Looks like a baby's butt. Yummy. Hey, what should I do? Is it my fault that you weren't careful? Hey, my dad will kill me. Have it aborted. Mom. Yes? - I will just go to the mall. I will buy a radio to help entertain you. Really? Yes, mom. I will be back in the afternoon. There's food on the table. Okay, fine. Okay. Take care, Elaine. - Yes, I will. Thank you. Hey, Benjie! Come up here! You're drinking all the time! You're talking about women again. Come up here, now! You don't care about us anymore! You're always with your friends. What's wrong with you?! Damn this life! Come up here! - Son of a bitch! Those breasts! - She's beautiful! You're so beautiful. Thank you. Where have you been? Nowhere. Just went to Glorietta Mall. You've been doing it frequently. What do you want me to do? Lock myself up at home? If I ever catch you doing anything foolish i will kill you. Don't accuse me of that. I'm not afraid of you. You don't have anything to show for. Orly. Why were you absent yesterday? I wasn't feeling well. You know what our policy is, right? You should've called it in so we could assign a reliever for you. I was feeling sick that's why I wasn't able to call. Whatever your reason is, you should've called! I'll file it as A.W.O.L., it's not a problem. (Absence without leave) [ Radio chatter ] What are you doing here? You should go. - I wanted to see you. Elaine, who's that? Who's that? - My blind mother in law. Please leave. She's blind, it's okay. - Please leave, Mom, it's nobody. Just a fish vendor. Please, just leave. What's wrong with you? It's late and your fish aren't fresh anymore. [I give you the new commandment] Let's go there. [Love one another] [Love each other, the way I love you.] [If you do this, everyone will know] [that you are my disciples.] [That's true. What is the true meaning of this?] [The true meaning of this is that...] [Life is too short.] [We should show everyone] [how to] [be guided by the Lord.] [As we all are.] [Not to be exactly righteous] [but at least make the effort to do so.] [God will proclaim the honor of His children] [And He will do this immediately.] [My children] [We only have a short time to spend with each other.] [You will search for me.] [I'm telling you this like what I have told the Jews] [You cannot go to where you want to.] You're such a jerk. You did it in front of the old lady? You should try it. Extreme thrill! Hey, Isko, they've been looking for you! - Yes, Boss! What if the husband catches you? For sure, I'm dead! I've heard that the husband is violent. I think that goes for any man. No. There are men who doesn't have the guts. That's impossible. Do you know, if it happened to me Somebody fell! Step aside! Step aside! Lie him down here. Carefully! Hurry up! Hurry up! Boss, I'm sorry. He wasn't being careful. What are you looking at? Back to work! What?! Back to work! Show's over! Elaine? Here. For you. Thank you. I hope you like it. It's beautiful. Such a waste, Miguel. I don't wear these things. When I saw that I knew it suits you. Are you happy? Yes. Miguel. What is this? Love? Why did you ask? I'm afraid to lose you. It's like... I gambled everything. Now I just want to know for what. For me, it's simple. I just want the both of us to be happy. Hi! Do you mind if we join you? Have a seat. Okay. By the way, he's Roy, my manager. And she's Marge, his wife. Hello. - Hi. Hi. Hi. So, you're the reason why Miguel's been absent at the site. You're married, right? The movie we're seeing is about to start. I'm sorry but we have to go. Pay for the bill. Okay, bye. Okay. Marge, you're so tactless. What? Elaine. Do you want to attend the counseling with Pastor? I think Pastor can't help us anymore, Orly. You're really something else, bro! Cheers! Just this once! - You're really something! Cheers! Cheers! You're an animal! - Isn't it something, bro? You're awesome, bro! Damn, bro! She's really effortless! Where did you get her? - She's something else too! She's the girl at the toll gate. They're together for quite a while now. - She's something else too! They're together for quite a while now. She's the girl at the toll gate. Oh, damn! Is she the one? She's the--- That was a long time ago. I told you, I'm good at this. - That's a new record. If she has moves like that, she's the best, right? That's right. - Hey, it's finished. Please hand it over, please! - Wait, wait! Okay. Hurry up! Here! Your damn porn! Porn... Idiot! - Bro... What? -Let me borrow this. Do you want a private screening? Of course! Bro, the one with Elaine. Just for a day. - With Elaine? Okay, okay. But give it back tomorrow. Yes. - Drop it off to me at the site. I'll drop it off there. Drop it off at the site, okay? Yes, bro, I will drop it off there. There's no label so it's really a secret. Has the service gone? Yes, it has left. If you want, you can wait for Antigua. You can ride up to Alabang. Why weren't you able to catch them earlier? Please stop betraying Orly. What do you mean? I may be blind, but I'm not stupid. I know the smell of sex. Just like what you did with your man here. Look at me, Elaine. This is what will happen to you. If you don't stop lusting for other men. I've made a mistake before. I drowned in lust. I sacrificed everything. But... I had a great debt that I had to pay fate. Up to now... I'm still paying for it. Don't be like me. Don't let it reach its threshold. Aren't you going to eat it, Orly? I'll take it. It's going to waste. Viand. Let's share it. Are you feeling sick? You're like that for a whole day. Come on, eat. Maybe he's got a big problem. Roy, bro. - Why? What happened? Good news! It's okay. Vivian approved it. Maybe getting her to bed helped that. Yeah, right. And she wants more. So, I can take a one month vacation? One week. What? One week? I worked hard on this account. Yeah, sure. You're an asshole. Miguel, where are you going? My work for today is done! -Wait, Miguel! Miguel. wait! Miguel! Miguel! Miguel! Elaine. Whatever it is that I've done to you... please forgive me. I know my shortcomings. I'm doing everything that I can. We were happy before, right? Right? I'm just hoping we can bring that back. Elaine, I love you very much. I really love you very much. Elaine. I'm leaving. What are you doing here? Miguel, I need to talk to you. Why? What's the problem? Can we do that later? Is it important? I'm pregnant. Maybe it's your husband's. Orly and I have tried before. I'm sure this is yours. Does he know about us? No. But he's starting to suspect. Elaine. Maybe it's time we end this. I'm just concerned for you. It's gonna be big scandal once he finds out. It's not too late for the both of you. But, Miguel. I love you. I'm ready to leave Orly. We never talked about that. We were just after the excitement. But don't you love me even for a bit? Elaine. Love, sex, pressure. It's all the same. The important thing is, it's with different partners. Miguel. I need you. Isn't it important to you that I'm carrying your child? No. We will have it aborted. Elaine. Elaine! Yes, you're pretty. It's just you. You don't want to try to put on lipstick. - Hi, Elaine. Look at it. - I don't want to. It's pretty. -You're annoying. Come on, it looks good. - I don't like it. Elaine? Mom. Orly's hasn't come home yet. Mom? He just fooled me. I'm so stupid. What happened? Will Orly forgive me? My son loves you very much. Hello? One moment please. Orly! Orly! It's your wife. Get back to work! Hurry up! Be careful you might drop it. Toh! Help him. Assist him! And you, hurry up! Be careful with that! Be careful! Hello? Orly. This is Elaine. Elaine. Why? You didn't come home last night. Mom and I were worried. [ What time will you be home tonight? ] We have a surprise for you. What kind of surprise? Nothing. I just wanted to ask an apology for my shortcomings. Elaine. Whatever our problem is... Orly, there's no more problem. I promise. Just forgive me. Elaine, I love you very much. I love you very much. I thought I've lost you. I love you too, Orly. Please come home early later, okay? Yes. Just wait for me. Take care. Yes. Orly, let's go. Okay, I have to go. We need to get to work. Bro, Where does Elaine live? The one who works at the toll booth? Elaine? She lives at the second floor. Do you know her husband? Orly? Of course. He's my friend. - Please give this to him. Tell him it's from his friend. Make sure he gets it. I'm sure he'd be happy and would want to know where it came from. No problem especially for five hundred. Okay. You think I'd always fool you. Somebody wanted to give this to your husband. He should watch it. And would really be happy. Can I borrow it after? [ Radio chatter ] [ What's your name? ] [ I'm Mariel. ] Elaine? Elaine? Just a minute. How much do I owe you? - Seventy pesos. Elaine, what's that I'm hearing? What's that? Sounds like having sex. Orly, please give her seventy pesos. Thank you. [ He left me. ] [ He left his wife. ] You're wet. [ In our culture, our tradition...] [ And in our environment ] [ Marriage couples... ] Let's try it without. Okay. Marge. Elaine. Orly? Orly? Orly! Orly! Orly, I will explain. I don't love him. Orly. Orly. Orly. Orly. You son of a bitch! You're an animal! - No! Have pity on me! Elaine? It's so nice to see you. I know you'll miss me.
