(It can not be, the Germans they do not have all this fantasy.) - Pass the newspapers. - Which? Everyone, I want to know why I'm here, I have to acquire information. It can be a few days, as long as it does not empty the newsstand. - For whom did you take me? - Benito Mussolini. (Mussolini) (Apparently it's all true, the war has not been won.) (Man) (Anglo-American planes unload on Rome more than a thousand tons of bombs) (causing more than 1500 victims.) (Mussolini) (They humiliated me, shot and hanged.)

I understood everything. - I have risen. - Yes, here's another one. (Giorgio) Captain all of us. (Mussolini) Destiny he brought me back here. - Who else could have done it? - Line A of the subway. It is the providence that is giving me the courage to continue my mission. Providence is giving to me a second chance. - Bravo, yes. - There is no second chance. It is possible to do twice the same error. After this pearl of wisdom I greet you. Oh, Duce. - Hello, crumb. - Hello, pearl. - (Gianni) Tomorrow remember the paprika. - Yes, my mother with this paprika! (Mussolini) (I am a prisoner of two pederasts.) (Other than the Wehrmacht plan.) How much he likes paprika, it drives him crazy. (Mussolini) (I must remain calm, do not be intimidated.) (Bring them out.) I had confined them to the Tremiti, already inverted. "Frocio", today we say "frocio". So listen to me, Mr. Frocio. I do not intend to stay in this place a minute more, kindly show me the road to my house. - Yes, where do you live? - Villa Torlonia. - Ah, you must take a bus. - Where is it? Here, in Piazza Matteotti. (MAKES A VERSE) I rather go on foot. This work can no longer be done. (Andrea, PC) Tisha, listen to me, your people are very hungry. You're hungry, make me feel hungry for your people, ok? - But I've already eaten. - Go play, Tisha. It does not work, there is no poetry. - Ready, Uncle. - (Carla) Dada, sleep, it's late. Zitta, mom, we are working to win Berlin. It is already so much if we win Locarno. - But who is that strange guy? - That's me going. No, back there, that bald man, seems Bisio. No, I said my name, it's not good. The bio cam. (Andrea) And Benito Mussolini. (Andrea, PC) One, two, three, action.

(PHOTOGRAPHS) (Andrea) Excuse me, Did you see a Mussolini dress? - How did you say that you call? - Canaletti, Andrea Canaletti, and her? Mussolini, Benito Mussolini. But it never comes out of the character? It is brilliant. - Do you already have a program? - Of course yes. - On which channel? - On all channels. Especially on that of Suez. (ANDREA RIDE) A nation of 45 million souls it's not really true if you do not have free access to the ocean. But she has to do "Zelig", a comic monologue, it could start ... What do you know about Egypt, Canaletti? - Of Egypt? - (Mussolini) Yes. The capital is Cairo, there are the pyramids, Sharm el-Sheikh, the camels. Summary information, a schoolboy would respond better. (Mussolini) you only have 220,000 Men. Less than 30 days to conquer the whole country. Where will you attack from? How you will handle the situation with the British? I forgot, you do not care about the English, right? To you who? Canaletti, the password is only one, categorical and demanding for everyone. It already transposes and lights the hearts from the Alps to the Indian Ocean. To win. And we will win. (Mussolini) My goal it is to travel to Italy and to regain it. I'd like to confess something to you, Canaletti. It is the providence that sent me. Providence he sent me by his side. - He sent you? - (Andrea) I'm a director. - Oh, director. - (Andrea) Yes. Cinematography it is a very powerful means. - Very. - For the State. What movie did you shoot? - "Bronze sentinels" I do not think so. - No. "The path of the gods" not even. "Black Jungle". No, I did not make any films, I'm more a documentarist. - Documentaries. - (Andrea) Yes. - Niche product. Which? Still nobody, but a movie about her it could be a bomb. (Andrea) Tell me yes. Perhaps he did not understand that I take her around Italy, I follow with the camera, A story like no one has ever done we do one thing. - I like it. - Paid expenses, of course. (Andrea) Credit cards, everything. (together) To Italy. the Fiorino is not you soon, it's my money, I work there. I have to think about Dada, to the gym and to you! How much superficiality. - (Andrea) For a few days. - No. Please, if I win one of these festivals I get on the stage and say, "I love you." All right, but it's the last time. Swear to me, if this is bad you come to work with me. (Dada) The keys. (HORN) (INDOQUENT VOICES) - This is the vehicle? - Yup. This is not a vehicle, he does not even have his own armor. Come on! Why are you laughing, Canaletti? I should have you shot. It is yellow, tin. I do not get on a toy. Balbo, Rossoni, Farinacci, Comrades, where are you? Excuse me, you still have to pay. Coffee, juice and croissant. They are 4.40. Dear Sir, You have made it a great service to the motherland. Assist at the beginning of a business that you will tell your nephews. This is priceless. (ENGINE ROMBO) We will take Italy back, Canaletti. We will not fail this time, we will clear Italy from north to south. I would start with his uniform, it smells a lot. You keep telling me about her. A man who gives her appears submissive, bourgeois, servile. I you must be abolished by the dictionary. So you prefer if I give it to you? You are impertinent, Canaletti. But on one thing you are right. This uniform stinks like the latrine of a Jew. I have to wash this uniform. - Wash, do you also want to iron? - Also ironing. Your name? - Benito Mussolini. - Benito Mussolini. - Not the pants! - It's an order. - We were not wearing underwear, sir. "I'm not a lord, I'm the Duce. We did not use it for anyone. Please, you have to Iavarle, I can no longer put them in this state. Madam, you can not stay in the car, it stinks. - Mahadisha, were we wearing underwear? - No, we did not want to. - Wash your underwear. - We were not wearing underwear. - You have to wash your underwear. - We were not wearing underwear. - I said you have to wash your underwear. - But we were not wearing underwear. - Come on, come on, I'll wash your underwear. - And a plot, Canaletti. (Andrea) Dai. Sorry. (Andrea) Benito Amilcare Andrea Mussolini. The first marshal of the empire, the brand new Italian, the aeronaut of thought. Turn off that devilry, I do not want to be immortalized like this. He will succeed in refounding the empire ... Remove yourself from your mouth that light movie parody. to travel in today's Italy, not in yesterday's. The greatest responsibility he is a politician. He does not realize what a turn it is taking Italy. Heads of families it is what leads the family. At least I've been used to it. For me, Italy is a country for the elderly, not for us young people. (INDOQUENT VOICES) Duce. Here, now you are the head of government. What would you do? "I'm back", 1.1 before. I would remove almost all the parties. I would leave maximum one or two parties and that's it. - It's all a "magnamagna". - D'accordissimo. Then, do you know what the Italian people are like? You eat, you eat, you eat, I eat and we're fine, it would take the revolution. (Andrea) Excellent. Tax, from north to south, without paying taxes. - What are they doing? Anything. - Anything. They do not because they can not eat us. You have voted for these politicians. - No. - No, I've never Voted. I voted only once. What is the use of going to vote? (Man 2) They take us only for the ass. Would you agree on a dictatorship? A free dictatorship, however, a dictatorship not too dictatorship. - One party. - Maximum two. Fascistone, but not too fascist. (Mussolini) (The individual left alone, if he is not a saint or a hero,) (he always refuses to pay taxes, obey laws or go to war.) Are you still shaving? Cut his neck instead of his beard! We do not exaggerate, otherwise we cross over in what they did. Go somewhere else to shave! Gentlemen, let's talk about today's Italy and not that of yesterday, please. ln Italy does not work almost anything. Prisons, hospitals, everything. (Man 3) Before there were other types of politicians. There was always a "magnamagna", as we say in Naples. Then he also ate the people, now ending ... gutters, it is politics that we have to talk about. No more than anti-political or civil society, just political. (Andrea) Italians hate politicians. In fact, they do not have to love politicians, they must love me. We're doing great, the video of this morning stands at 12,000 Views. Comments are also positive. No, Duce, the minibar, no, I pay them for this. (Andrea) Woe to poverty. The potato no. - Does not television work? - Is this the television? And this is the remote control. (Man, TV) Private planes, luxury suites. Now I'm complete, first if I put myself a sheep I looked like an appaloosa horse. (Man, TV) Today Marco and Matteo have known the power of the storm. (SONG FROM TV: "FRATELLI D'ITALIA") What a powerful means of propaganda to regain this country. - Already done. - From who? Berlusconi. The onion is darkening ... (Man) Excuse me, the red team ... You do nothing but eat, in Italy. (Giorgione) We split in half zucchini. (Mussolini) Cooks. - (Cracco, TV) Fast! - Cooks. - Bread. - (Mussolini) Cooks. - (Woman, TV) Two seconds ... - Cooks. We can also salt the meat ... I want to send one of these idiots in a white coat in a field kitchen in Abyssinia. Come and talk to me of frittatina aI black currant. - (Mussolini) Are you married? - (Andrea) No. - (Mussolini) I imagined it. - What does it mean? To conquer a woman It takes courage, Canaletti, and that's what you're missing. Tell me something, will not you be a fagot? If the dictatorship returns I go to church every day and I go back to believing that there is a Christ, the Madonna 0 whoever she is. Because sheep they need a pastor. Sorry. (Andrea) At the end of the bridge on the left and we arrived. Canaletti, left never, let's go round. I take responsibility, Italian does not want to work. (Mussolini) (These people it does not need only a leader.) (These people need a father.) ! theme is that there are too many non-EU citizens. But this it does not have a particular meaning. (Man) We must see how They are welcomed. (Man) From what we see on TV many are on the phone, they are gymnasium, wearing the Nike jumpsuit. They have their own advantage, they bring 60 families, so ... This is the local chicken. I think that mixing the races it never works. I can? - Chianina is a pure breed, right? - Yes, it is a native, pure breed. Now, if you meet a Chianina cow with a Moroccan Cow that would come out? A tragedy would come out. The race is gone, and that's it that is happening in Italy, Canaletti. Yes, but people they are not cannon fodder. (Mussolini) Come closer, I do not feel very well. - What place is this? - And piazzale Loreto. What happens? What do they teach you at school? It is not right for me to find them inside the house. That take everything away. We have to shoot them before they land. I swear, you can not take it anymore. - What would be a solution? - Suppress them. Egyptians, Romanians, Albanians, etc. It has a ranking of the population that ... - A ranking? - Yes, which one is the worst? Right now I can not tell you because they are all the same, in my opinion. (Man) I think the big problem is the fact that someone is missing that you take on your shoulders the Italian people. - Are you read? - Very well. - Since when? - For a long time. Really? (Mussolini) (The identity of the nation it must be re-launched.) (People want answers, not just questions.) (Man) The teacher of my son He wants to remove the crucifix from the class out of respect for them? They came to us, Not the other! I would throw them all into the sea like dogs, those disgusting. You would throw them at sea drowning women and children? Yup. And you say it without being ashamed not at all'? No. Then fish feed on corpses and you would pay money at the restaurant for a bass pulled up to Abyssinian meat? - He's joking, obviously. - (Mussolini) I never joke. (man RIDE) (Man) Do you know what it would take? A revolution. It is the plow that traces the furrow but it is the sword that must defend it. The plowshare and the blade they are both of hardened steel like faith in our hearts. - I told you this. - Latina, 1934. My father had the record. Dearest factor. would you follow me? Would you fight in the front row for me? blentieri, however next week He marries my daughter, it's not a good time. (Man 2) Dad! - Pope! - And my son-in-law. (SONGS: "ITALIAN" BY TOTO CUTUGNO) (SONG FROM RADIO: "ITALIAN" OF TOTO CUTUGNO) - (Mussolini) What is this song? - And an old Italian song. (radio) "I'm an Italian", I like it. What is the name of the comrade who sings it? It's called Toto Cutugno. (radio) always in the right hand. A partisan as president, this southern has a sense of humor. No, it really happened. Sandro Pertini, he was the best of all. - (Mussolini) What's the car? - Nothing, all right. We hope, Canaletti. (Mussolini) (I who pushed to the victory the Seventh Army.) (I find myself pushing a van of Campania dairy products.) (Laura) Sorry. - This is a tribute to her. - (Mussolini) Ah. Gutters. Benito Mussolini, honored. - Laura. - Pleasure, Canaletti. Pleasure, he is Filippo, my jack russell. - (Mussolini) Filippo. - (Laura) Yes. - (Mussolini) You're English, eh? - Does it allow? - Of course. - He likes animals a lot. - How beautiful. Are you shooting a movie? (Andrea) More or less, it is a docufilm of which I take care of texts and direction. It's called "I'm back". - Congratulations. - Thank you. But he knows that my husband worked in Rai? - Ah. - Yes, he was a director's programmer. - Then he died. - I'm sorry. Filippo, what are you doing, do not you talk, do you shut up? Does the enemy listen to you? (DOG WHICH RINGS) Yes, we would like to present it at the Berlin festival. - Beautiful. - But we do not say: "Happy birthday." - It's bad. - I'm sorry. (DOG WHICH RINGS) What are you doing? Play, he's playing with it. (CANE THAT GUAISCE) - Excuse me but kicked him? - No, it's a game. - He fired. - (Laura) No, Filippo! - What the fuck are you doing? - Filippo! What did you do? Pardon miss. (Laura) Assassins! But how the fuck came to your mind? To acts of war it is answered by acts of war. - You are crazy. - No, it's Filippo who was English. - You're really crazy. - And the only language he could understand. Give me the gun, it's mine! (Andrea) You can not go around with a loaded pistol because you risk shooting to a Christian, you can not! Yes it can! What a madman. (ACOUSTIC SIGNAL) (ACOUSTIC SIGNAL) (MOBILE PHONE) Who's at this time? - Nobody. - (Mussolini) How nobody? - Come on, sleep. - Will not it be a girl, by any chance? Damn the misery, oh. Oh, you like the fat whiskey too, eh, Canaletti? - (Mussolini) What do you say? - Nothing, they have the wrong number. A female is never wrong number. - Oh, no, give it back, what are you doing? - I send a cable, you do that, do not you? (Andrea) Give me the phone. (ANDREA FA DEI VERSI) I can kill a man even without a gun, Canaletti. "My dear, I start by telling you, pearl youth you gave me ... " (Andrea, Francesca) ("What I love you as in 2015, 2016 ... ") (together) "In 2017 and 2018." "That's why I want you by my side, indomitable, now, now ... " (together) "Tomorrow." - Come on, what shape do I do? - The figure of a man, Canaletti. Madonna, what a shit figure, my mother. (MOBILE PHONE) - He answered. - Of course he answered. - What does he say? - "What are you trying?" (Mussolini) What does this mean? - What I'm trying with her. - What do you want to pair with? (Andrea) "Coupling" is used for the animals. This is because you have never paired. - (Andrea) What did you write? - I wrote: "Yes". (MOBILE PHONE) - "Come back soon", smiley face. - Congratulations, Canaletti. Madonna, but you are a genius! Asshole! Camerata Canaletti, attentive to syphilis. (Andrea) Yes! I recommend, always wear the bladder! (Andrea) How nice, I'll mate! All politicians, trade unionists, bureaucrats ... The school? Nothing for the boys, here. honestly, I would not change the country. Italy is a country of shit. I do not read anything, I do not watch movies, all day with the phone. Young people do not have to go abroad. Surely I will leave. If you do not know you can also have Whitney Houston's voice but stay home and sing karaoke. They have to get out of this country, I do not want to see anyone here anymore. If they come all here we go to Africa, there is space. They are not too many, they are never too many. Those I know they make an ass like that. Then there are also Romanians, what should we do? (SONGS: "ITALIAN" BY TOTO CUTUGNO) I'm here too. a slowly song. (SONGS: "ITALIAN" BY TOTO CUTUGNO) Land fighters, sea fighters ... Duce, alice, Duce, alle! What's this bullshit? It is strong, provocative, it hits straight to the heart, do you understand? You're crazy, you want to get involved a documentary on Mussolini? Yes, but look, He has made 1,700,000 Views. I just uploaded it, I also have other material. - How much it is? - 1,700,000. - (Leonardi) Did you talk to others? - No. Let's do something, leave me the shot and the contact then maybe I'll show up. (RINORE DI RIACQUONE) Canaletti, but this is not a circus, are you crazy? My grandfather was a partisan, fuck. (Leonardi) Stop this guy, he has not even washed his hands. (DOOR OPENS) Oh God. And who is she? Are we so desperate? The casting office is in the other corridor. Let's continue. On this I believe you are right. Mrs? Bellini, Katia Bellini. (BATTE IL PIEDE) Enchanted. What would I be right about? About the fact that this country He is truly desperate. (Mussolini) I have a proposal for you. - And what would it be? - Let's save Italy together. It's a great idea, now enough, the show is over, let's go. - Thanks, please. - Leonardi, a moment. How do you plan to save Italy? do you drink coffee? - (Katia) Only decaffeinated. - Sure. - do you drink coffee? - (together) Yes. - (Mussolini) The lady drinks coffee. - (Woman) Yes. Who is responsible for this coffee? Of the preservatives that put us in? Certainly not those who produce it. He delegates someone else that delegates someone else who delegates. It's called globalization, everyone drinks it and nobody does it. Exact. This also applies to politics. btate, Vote, Vote. How many times have you voted in these last years? But what's the use of Voting, if you do not have the slightest idea then of what the politicians do what have you voted for? (Mussolini) You need a boss that you take responsibility of the choices he makes. If Ethiopia is invaded Italians must know why. I read that our armies have gone to bomb Kosovo and Iraq. - (Mussolini) Do you know why? - Um ... It is a "peace keeping" operation. Continue to use foreign words. What is it, do you really feel so inferior? To safeguard peace. (LAUGHS) They told you that they are waging war to safeguard peace. Old trick that I used too and the world has happened. Who knows how long it took to prepare this speech. I do not need to prepare what I think, Donna Bellini. Leonardi, find a TV format suitable for this actor. - Comrade. - A format? But... - Immediately. - Okay... - (Katia) One last thing, sir ... - Mussolini. Yup. His satire is very interesting but I would not treat the subject of race. It's not funny. I would also leave Germany and Hitler outside. Could not agree more, they have already ruined me once, I will not allow it that they do a second one. - Leonardi, then, how did it go? - What? - (Andrea) In the office. - Ah, all right. - Sure? - Yes, yes. So am I back inside? I have a lot of ideas ... - Can I send them? - Yes, do well, send. Let's keep in touch, maybe done I live in six weeks. - Such as? - Yup. - (Mussolini) Leonardi. - Who is it? Can I talk to you a moment? Oh, holy God. (Leonardi) Here we are. Obviously Canaletti will be reinstated in the organic today. Obviously. ln a suitable position to his abilities. - Obviously. - Well. Well. (Man) The coffee, very great, even to her. - (together) Thanks. - You are welcome. Nice recommendation. Thanks, now I understand what you think of me and of our friendship. Camerata Canaletti. If you do not like the position that has been assigned to you why did not you rebel? - Who renounces the fight ... - And a son of a whore. - Waiver of life. - Excuse me, I remembered differently. Leonardi wants his coffee, it is the third Time that asks for it. Damn the misery. - Canaletti, and my coffee? - You take it alone. What the fuck are you saying, are you crazy? I'm a director, I want a more important role. - You are a director. - It's funny? - Yup. - I'm leaving today. - Yes, good luck for everything. - I also take Mussolini away. - Wait, Canaletti. - I'm here. - Do not be impulsive, what do you want? - The role of project manager. - Second production assistant. - First. - Third. - The second is fine. (Andrea) bglio stay in the same hotel of Mussolini. - Yup. - And I would like the bathroom in the room. For the bathroom Let's see what we can do. There's more? - No, at the moment it's all. - Ok. (Andrea) It will only be a temporary job, you know that my dream is to do the documentary on Mussolini. - I think it will remain a dream. - You will propose it to me. - Can I have my coffee now? - It's not my job. (Andrea) New color? Do not tell me anything. - "Negro di Notte in a Dark Lane"? - No, it's "London smoke." Do you like it? Very. Would you like to have a beer with me tonight? I can not tonight, damn, I have Zumba, now I have paid. (Andrea) Zumba? What a bullshit. You go out with me tonight, I'll tell you. - Are you feeling well? - No sorry. I was wrong, sorry. (MUSIC) No, he can not touch me like that. My ass touches me! I was interviewing an African child and used the subjunctive. He said: "If I had not been hungry ..." Instead we say? No, to make you understand, one that speaks our language well It means that it is integrated, which is Italian. (Andrea) Because one should insist by saying, "Do they have to leave"? An African child who ... Hey. Are you stupid? Come on. Have you ever put a bass in a black hand? No. They play, they put themselves there and they play. You put them on the drums and they play. Do you dance them? Your girlfriends Zumba would make a shit figure. ! your friend must be a good actor, he gave you a slap that looked like True. - It was True. - What are you saying? Yes, my head still turns. Really. - I was fine anyway, thanks. - Pur'io. - I arrived. - Ah, goodnight. (Francesca) Do you want to salt the kings? - At your place? - No, from the neighbor. - (Andrea) From you, then. - Yes but do not make strange ideas. I can not because tomorrow I'm full of things to do, really. But still for the documentary? No, the documentary it's a moment in brackets. - I had a promotion from MyTV - Really! It's one more reason to celebrate, no? Eh. - Yes, without kissing us, always. - No, but I would never kiss you. OK thanks. No, not even me anyway, I would never kiss you. Never. I'm sorry. - (Andrea) I'm a bit rusty. - (Francesca) Do not worry, I do. Ah! Oh, God, who is he? Francesca, who is this handsome young man? Nobody, Grandma, Go to sleep. Madam, I'm mortified, they are Canaletti, pleasure. - Pleasure. - (Andrea) Hi. But you did not tell me there was ... Grandmother. Quiet, so has Alzheimer's, in a while he forgets himself. How do you forget? He saw us now. Ah! Oh God. Francesca, who is this handsome young man? Madam, I'm the first one, it's always me. - Pleasure. - Pleasure. (Leonardi) Here, this will be his new empire. - You will have to do some training. - (Mussolini) I do not need it. Let's call it a strategy, alignment, is it better? Always use the language of war, then it makes you afraid to do it. She is the first time she makes TV, right? I believe he has no experience of communication. Believe badly, I invented the propaganda. The exhibition on the revolution of fascism of '32 was memorable. Without me Hitler he would not have become the Fiihrer. Even. I need a typewriter. We can do better. Please get up. - Sorry, why me? - (Leonardi) Be nice, Go. We can have them a company email, ok? - Francesca! Where is Canaletti? "Why do you ask me that, excuse me?" I can here Canaletti in 30 seconds, and this is an order. - All right, Mr. Mussolini. - Duce, you can call me Duce. - All right, Mr. Duce. - What are you doing? Pull that arm down. Do you want us all to go to jail? Go and call Canaletti. (Leonardi) Sit down. It's a mouse, it will look. Put it here, move it and the arrow on the screen moves. Try it yourself. Why mouse? Can not we call it "mouse"? - Let's call it "mouse", right? - (Andrea) So, look. Choose a name for your e-mail. - My name, Benito Mussolini. - And his name True? Not at all, my real name is Toto Cutugno. Kill, like the singer. It was a joke, Donna Francesca. Then, "Benito.Mussolini" is busy. - Someone stole my name? - No, it simply is not available. - Let's try with a nickname. - Try "Dux". "Dux" is busy but "Dux2018" is free. I'm not Dux2018. This typewriter does not work! - Have you tried with "Duce"? - Taken. - "The infallible". - No, got it. - "Messiah". - Taken. - "Superhuman". - (Andrea) No. - "Beam" - Taken. - "Camicianera", "Excellence", "He". I took this too. "The intuitive conscious extra that it has the extemporaneous sense of the present. " - It's too long, it does not fit in. - "Honor and respect." Lucky you, it's a fiction with Gabriel Garko, he is very present. And what a fuck. "Echecazzo" is free, password? - What is the password? - Password. "BOIACHIMOLLA" all attacked, all caps. Remember the username, This is the internet. "How to stretch your penis in just three moves. " Then let's do this, write a word here. - The first claws come to mind. - Here, go. "Claretta Petacci". (Francesca) Was she his woman? Kill, how beautiful. Wonderful woman. She died because of me. What are you crying, Mr. Duce? No. Look, a cat that launches from the balcony. How do you proceed with him? Well, apply, study, it's not a top but ... I recommend, I do not want jokes on Jews, Roma and homosexuals, clear? - Sure. - We leave outside the immigrants. - (Leonardi) Yes, dear. - Do not call me dear. - No dear. - (Katia) Leonardi. My idea, a little retro taste, do you like it? It makes shit. (Leonardi) Jews, foreigners, homosexuals, handicapped, we must target also the government. (INDOQUENT VOICES) Gypsies, minorities. Romanian, corrupt politicians, these are the good arguments. Finally a bit of freedom, good, Daniele. You have to get out of jokes though, of the gags, strength. You must not have limits. If you feel the limits you have to overcome them. I can be a racist. Excuse one thing, which means What do you want to be a racist? (Leonardi) What I said. Mussolini must speak like Mussolini, not like a Christian Democrat. (INDOQUENT VOICES) - Holy words. - (Man) I have it. You know how to save it a clandestine drowning? (together) No. Better! Well. (Leonardi) Even worse, good, guys. So, very well. More! Permit, then, how are we going? We are ready? Beautiful tonics. A little 'trick no? You look like a dead man, Mussolini. I do not ever trick. This is also an idea. All right, ready, let's go. (Mussolini) (Benito, you're on the scene again.) (Katia) Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with you you are blessed among women and blessed is the fruit of your womb, Jesus. Saint Mary, mother of God, pray for us sinners ... (APPLAUSE) For decades it has disappeared, now he's finally back. We welcome him, Benito Mussolini. (APPLAUSE FROM TV) Hangman who spring. (VERSI DI ESU LTANZA) (subheading) The hunchback. (subheading) Will it be wanted? - Is it a script? - I do not think so, not that long. So it's a blackout. Like Andreotti Dalia Perego. Do something, send ... No, let's give it time. You are all afraid of silence, eh? There is a man next to me with a sign that I should read. It's a joke about immigrants. (Mussolini, TV) Why do? jokes about immigrants? If you have mice in the house mica calls a comic, called disinfestation. - A little strong. - No, no, break. (Mussolini, TV) TV in my hotel is thin. A marvel of human ingenuity. What they show you in this wonder of human ingenuity? Shit. When the crisis makes people feel he needs not to think. blete laugh. That's why in 1940 we only produced comedies. But then it was right that way. You were a people of illiterates. After 80 years I come back and I find a people of illiterate there. (APPLAUSE) With his head bowed staring at the screen of a phone. In a state of perennial, depressive coma, that prevents you from looking what happens around you. You are without dreams. ln balia of social media that make you alone, envious and full of resentment. The newspapers say that the one against Islamic terrorism it can not be called a war of civilization. I agree, it's just a war. (LAUGHS) Do not laugh. The news is that we are losing it before even starting to fight. Child poverty, poverty among young people, poverty among the elderly. Unemployment. (Mussolini) Births they have never been so low. No wonder. Who would like to bring children into the world if then their maximum aspiration is it to become a cook? (LAUGHS) (Mussolini) We are running meeting the abyss. (Mussolini) You need of a WhatsApp message that warns you that we are sinking? (INDOQUENT VOICES) In my opinion, we split. You've got mail. that the hour is already approaching. - Mussolini has won! - Yup! (VERSI DI ESU LTANZA) (Katia) Yesterday we were the program more seen with 33% share and 60% in the youth segment. Not only that, we are the most tweeted program in the history of Italian TV. Great, even on Instagram they put a lot of pictures. - Also on Facebook. - (Andrea) And Instagram. ! our competitor Canal Più did less than half of our ratings, all this thanks to you. Because of you. From tomorrow I want Benito in all the spaces of our palimpsest. - If someone wants him as a guest ... - He must pay dearly. - (Katia) Bravo. - And our stuff. Italian will be sol. (APPLAUSE) (VERSI DI ESU LTANZA) Very well. We are going to have here in the studio, at the desk, what is without a doubt the character of the moment. Welcome him with a big applause. (Cattelan) I swear, I never thought to say it. Benito Mussolini! (VERSI DI ESU LTANZA) (VERSI DI ESU LTANZA) (Cattelan) Benito Mussolini. ! public loves it, apparently. Duce, what a country did he find on his return? (MUSIC) (LAUGHS) blete know it? - (together) Yes. - I would say yes, we are here for this. Northern Rhodesia, and I think I said everything. No, he really did not say anything. If I said Congo I would be clearer? Or should I say Nigeria? (APPLAUSE) Nigeria is fine. (MUSIC) Yes, they laugh, But I hope I do not offend it. His comedy seems to me to touch the belly of this country, if you will allow me, in the worst sense of the term. I do not think you will talk about comedy when there will be a bantu to take your place. With the Iabbroni, the nose ring ... (MUSIC) And all the rest. (MUSIC) (Cattelan, TV) Ok, so ... - Pleasure. - Pleasure. So you're telling me that has actually risen. It's a burden I have to bring. (LAUGHS) I do not think I would have sent her back, if I could have chosen, of course. And who would you have chosen in my place? (MUSIC) I hope for you he is not. (LAUGHS) No, actually not him, but maybe Marilyn Monroe? I do not know, how unista? (MUSIC) (Cattelan) He is not a communist. When do you think this will end? When will you throw the mask? Because she has a kind of surreal comedy and also interesting, mysterious. He managed to delete from Google all traces of his past. Everyone knows my identity. My name is Benito, Mussolini with surname. Okay, I would avoid the curriculum because that is known. He said something right this time. (LAUGHS) Um ... - Projects for the future? - Doing the empire. (LAUGHS) Yup. He has already tried us once and it did not go very well. I'm back to fix the shot. (IMITA LO SPARO) (LAUGHS) (MUSIC) (VERSI DI ESU LTANZA) You have a TV program, you are very popular on the internet, explain to me what else do you want? - bglio know my army. - What army? It's useless for us to go, those of the far right are four cats. Even in my day they said that we were four cats. - Look, those are dangerous. -I want to win back Italy. I'm not a coward like you, that just became second production assistant you hung a camera at the nail. However, also Scorsese he was second production assistant. Scorsese, what is it? It's a Chinese game, do you know that? It is not a national sport. (Mussolini) Who won the World Cup in '34? (Mussolini) And in '38? The problem of this country, Canaletti, it's memory. (Mengalli) What's up? Ah, it's you, hi, Mengalli. Mussolini. Yes, I know very well who she is, I always see it on television. - What do you want from me? - what can you give me? -What do you mean? - Do you have 500 men? (LAUGHS) Your comedy it does not make me laugh at all. instead make you cry, think about doing the revolution with the games of society. - And you taking the dead for the ass? - Leave the dead alone. You have no idea how you can communicate with the new generations. (Mussolini) As you think to conquer the country? Granted that you could do it once what do you plan to do to the government? Nothing, here's what you will do. You are too soft with the blacks. Look, go away, it's better. He is threatening me. No, he's not threatening you. It's better if we leave. He is threatening me. - Marching on Rome will not be easy. - No. Lord. It's true. In this city it is difficult get permission for anything, let alone for a march on Rome. Accom pay them off, goodbye. (Andrea) Let's go. (Mussolini) (The party of confusion dominates the political scene of the country.) You're right, Canaletti. Fascism is an idea, these have none. I never said it, goodbye. (Mussolini) (Politicians on the right they are afraid to call themselves right.) (Those on the left are afraid to say things left.) (Only I speak the truth.) (you believe me an actor.) (VERSI DI ESU LTANZA) (Mussolini) (I'll let you believe it.) (CANZON AND: "FACCETTA N ERA") Guys, if this video arrives to a million of Likes I will be bald, a bowl, shaved to zero, and I will scream from the balcony ... To win! And we will win! Many enemies, a lot of honor. But this is crazy, grandfather! Hangman who spring! (Sun) "Evolution" It seems like a nice word, "Authoritarianism" fascinating. A beautiful fascism that returns to make people feel the very smart fools illudendoli that there will not be a price to pay. (CANZON E: "FACCETTA N ERA") When he was there the tits were worth more. But if I shaved my hair to zero? (FIRE) (Cottarelli) What do you think? of today's Italian football? Presidents of Beijing, Indonesian balls, African soccer players, I would not speak of Italian football. Then the referees were more beautiful with the black jacket. Fortunately, the past he does not even come back for a joke. (VOICES IN DIFFERENT FOREIGN LANGUAGES) It is the most loved by Italians, with a scratchy and surreal comedy iI "Mussolini Show" it makes us laugh but also reflect. - (Woman) Let's talk about politicians. - They are like the subjunctive, disappeared. And you miss the subjunctive. (LAUGHS) - We are also from Mentana. - And let's go. - You should be ashamed. - Who, us? - And you. - Ah, and why? We hear you have to say. - Mussolini was a criminal. - Still with this story? In Ethiopia, the fascists killed 760,000 people, even with gas. - Children, women, men. - Honey, what's all this got to do with it? In Italy, 300,000 people died pearl of Russia. Well, you have to say that 300,000 is a nice figure. They are already dead, What the fuck has this got to do with it? Have you ever heard of comedy? Of fiction? Of character? People love it because they agree with what he says, not because he makes you laugh. - I understand, but it's also funny. - What are you saying? They believe he's right, it's absurd. Instead you do not give a damn. You do not make any moral scruples. What are you talking about? It's not my fault if you do not have irony. - No, this is not irony. - It's called satire. - It is not satire. - Do not argue. - The girl a little ... - Journalists love it. - Can you read? - (Woman) Of course, I am a mass of servants. I'm a bunch of balls. You should be ashamed. Now stop, I can not be insulted. - Look, go quiet, I'm going. - Out. You're sorry, you're a single person. Courage, Bellini, many enemies very honor, no? (Francesca) Leonardi. Leonardi. Excuse me, as I charge the dog, travel expenses or other? - Because you know, the mistress ... - The dog? - Yes, Mussolini shot him. - Alia mistress? AI dog, now that is pissed off black and He wants to be compensated. - I do not understand. - It does not seem difficult to me. - I'll take care of it. - OK perfect. Fabulous. - Thing? - Anything. Let's see now if they do not drive you away a kick, bad bitch. (Mentana) Good evening. He was born in Dovia di Predappio on 29 July 1883, he was a journalist and director of "Avanti", "People of Italy", he was the founder of fascism, the head of government, the Duce, the founder of the empire, the marshal of the empire. We thought we saw it for the last time that April day of many years ago in Piazzale Loreto in Milan. (Mentana) Instead, good evening, Benito Mussolini. I was also in charge of the Italian Social Republic. Yes, but she's here as a comedian, tonight. Some see me like that, especially at the beginning. - (Mentana) Then? - After they love me. (LAUGHS) Then to love, and what is your political project? First listen and then do. Not like that gang of criminals and whores you have in government that they do not do before and then they do not even listen. Look, satire is satire but defamation is another thing. I do not do satire, I prefer to make the revolution. (APPLAUSE) No. (Mentana) Here we do not applaud. However I'm sure that will not applaud when they will see this movie I'm about to show you too. It will not boast, look. (VERSES OF AMAZING) (PROTEST VOICES FROM TV) But is he crazy? Oh, sir. - What is it? - What is that? A murder. - Is this his revolution? - It was just a dog. - Why did he kill him? - Because he bit me. - First the calf, then a hand. - Do not you shame? Pagliaccio, at home! (Mentana) Sorry, there is no need. - Can you send the advertisement? - No, it's worse. Let's see what it means. (VERSES OF PROTEST) I transform this place of recommended, incompetent, in a desert. But stop it. How did they find these images? I burn it and then I piss on it. Here, this would be comical if it were not terrible. (VERSES OF PROTEST) (Katia) Congratulations, now you are the boss. But if I have done everything to defend you, treasure. - (Leonardi) I'm very sorry. - Who do you think you're gonna take your ass? He did not take it well. Dr. Bellini, I wish you the best as well. I knew it would not work, because people are tired of trash television. Now we do not exaggerate. Katia. Leonardi, knows how much they have done to share at the time of killing the dog? I do not say to kill a dog live every night ... But you would do it. A Canal More are waiting for me with open arms, best wishes. Mr. Canaletti, because he has abandoned the entertainment world? Well... (BELL) Andrea, could not you call me? Do you arrive like this, without warning? Only a few days, the time to reorganize. The house is small. (BELL) - (Francesca) Who is it? - (Mussolini) Il Duce. - (Francesca) Who? - Toto Cutugno. (Francesca) Ah! (DOOR OPENS) (Francesca) I'm sorry for what happened with the dog. (Andrea) We do not know where to go. Excuse us if we invade you like this. What's joking? For me it is a pleasure. I assure you that it was not for the Ethiopians. (Francesca) Give me the coat. (Andrea) Hi, grandma, are you all right? (Francesca) They come to stay a little bit from us, ok? What happens? I know who he is, I recognized him. - He will have mistaken it for Claudio Bisio. - Those eyes do not forget. You are Benito Mussolini. (Francesca) He is an actor, it sounds like him but it's not that true. No, it's the Real one. - Out of here, criminal! - Calm, grandmother. Grandma, let's do a satire program, he's a comedian. - Is not he. - Yup. 1024 people raked up like dogs in the ghetto of Rome. At dawn, because they were afraid that we escaped. They stopped at nothing. Women, children, brought to Auschwitz, killed in the gas chambers garzie to the racial laws of this scoundrel. Even then people laughed. (Lea) Even then they believed it was just a comedian. People forget, they still believe in the story that fascism was different from Nazism as if it could be more or less murderers, more or less cowards. (Lea) Only one woman is back from hell, a girl. She saved herself by pretending to be dead, hiding under a pile of corpses for six days. That child was me. (Lea) I was freed by the British. I was alive because maybe I was already dead. Not even those criminals they can kill twice. When I saw myself in that boy's eyes that pulled me out of that pile of rotting corpses I was afraid. (Lea) I was afraid of my anger. He did not come back, I came back, here, to look at him in the face. Get out of here! Criminal, murderer! - (Francesca) It's nothing. - Street! - He said to leave, go! - We're leaving. - Go away! Never again. - (Francesca) Come on, grandma. - (Lea) Street. - We have to go. - (Francesca) Do not worry. - (Andrea) Dai. (Francesca) Look at me. (Francesca) Nothing happened. I'm getting old, Canaletti. I should have fired on my head to that old Jew. But maybe it was better to save it. A politician must learn from the mistakes of the past. If I had executed her in front of her witnesses would have been a trouble. You saw what happened with the dog. Christ, at least once you can to take a break from the character? Porca bitch, hasta, that woman suffered. I understand, you're worried because Francesca is Jewish. Maybe you're lucky and only a small part of her is Jewish. The body can bear a minimum amount of "jew". And then they say that sexually the judges are very active. Confirm? - What kind of person are you? -I? A winner, you? No, you are a monster, you scare me, I do not like what you say. I do not want to see you anymore, you disgust me. Canaletti. The imprint you will leave on the photographic plate of history it is blurred. (THUNDER) Christ. (Andrea) It can not be. No! No! You are a mass of incompetent balls. Before Mussolini this TV existed or not? Yes, but people now He no longer wants the usual comedians. All right, let's spend more, we call a laughter star. - I do not want Iagne. - It would take Zalone. Maybe, we can not sell anymore advertising space. Idea, let's get back to him. But that he; Mussolini is finished. People will never forgive him. (Mussolini) (Providence he abandoned me.) (Governing this country it's not just difficult, it's useless.) (I'll go back home.) (SHOUT) (MAKES VERSES) (MUSSOLINI ANSIMA) (Mussolini) I died another time. The border was near. The disguise did not work. (Katia) Beautiful fright that you made me take. Claretta. Donna Bellini. - What am I doing here? - (Katia) Plan. Plan. Environmentalists, animal rights activists, neo-fascists they beat her at the best. Environmentalists, animal rights activists, neo-fascists, what a mess in this country. Good thing I'm there next to her. He must thank them. It will appear in the eyes of the nation like a Victim. What's on your mind? (Katia) Bring her back to power. times are ripe for the revolution. Are you alone, Donna Katia? We are all alone, Benito. Then we are there, a few minutes are left at the first episode of the highly anticipated show licensed by Canal Più. After the TV of pain, here is the TV of forgiveness. (Woman, TV) Katia, "I forgive you"? (Dada) Uncle is getting worse. I believe forgiveness both the strongest feeling, because it is born of love but it was nourished by hatred. (Woman, TV) Sometimes it's not easy forgive, we can not all do it. It takes a lot of understanding to accept human limits. (Woman, TV) Katia, it starts for you a new presenter adventure. (Katia, TV) So much shit, can you say? You can, who will be the first guest to ask Italians for forgiveness? you in a Old knowed ledge. Ready for live. Here we are, show the wounds, let's say clear and round that has been attacked. It must pity them. Make it work. It will work, Donna Katia. Though they will not forgive me, you have already won. How's your arm? - Luckily it was the left one. - (Man) On stage! They must not forgive it, it's the True one. (Woman) Two, one, acronym. (Katia) Ladies and gentlemen, Benito Mussolini is here with us. (APPLAUSES, FISCHI) (Man) Buffoon, Go away! Sorry, I can not do it, really. Laura, let's hear what he has to say, then you will decide whether to forgive him or not. We owe it to your poor dog, to Philip. For me it was like a child. That poor animal he did not deserve to die like that. - Not that way, at least. - (Man 2) You're a shit! But I can assure you he did not suffer, she died instantly, without a complaint. - It's an unforgivable gesture. - It's not the only mistake I made. Hey, where the fuck ... Comrades, friends, let's make death of poor Filippo was not useless. We build a kennel in his memory, and let's do it together. - Fermo, where are you going? - I have to get in, we have to stop Mussolini. - Do not think about it, we're live. - It's not a comedian, it's the real one! - (Man) Yes, maybe. - Ok. - No! - Stop! (Mussolini) We guarantee a better life for the foundlings who have not been lucky enough to find a mistress who loved them as well as ... (CRY) Sorry. Bring your faith to me, I will put them here, next to mine. (APPLAUSE) (Katia) Laura, what do you want to do? I do not know. Who is without sin cast the first stone. Think carefully. (Andrea) Stop! Do not do it, do not give him another chance! - (Man 3) He can not stay here. - Canaletti? (Andrea) You do not realize it, he is the real one! - You are the Duce. - I never said the opposite. - You want to take back the power! - I have no difficulty admitting it. Leave him. Please, a microphone. We have to stop it. And she is worse than him. Let's go along with it the visions of this boy or continue our shov fl What are you doing? It is the story that repeats itself! You're right, Canaletti, history repeats itself. So this country it was as ungovernable as now and do you know who saved him? No, you did not save it. I have governed it for 20 years with the consent, not with terror, Canaletti. This people loved me! Laura, if he forgives him it will be the end for us all. Donna Laura, You do not have to listen to this crazy person. - Democracy will die. - Democracy is already dead. Laura, there's no more time, what do you want to do? Do you want to forgive this gentleman? Mr. Mussolini, but she really wants to build a kennel and dedicate it to my Philip? He's a liar, he will not. No it is not true. (VERSES OF PROTEST) We will build it all together! (APPLAUSE) (SHOUT) OMG. (Katia) Calm, stop! Dada, Come on, let's go there. (Katia) Stop! (ANDREA ARMA LA PISTOLA) You will not shoot, Canaletti. You are a coward. I will do it, you are a criminal. If you kill me you will kill a part of yourself and all of them. I'm not like you! I'm not like you! The beauty of the live. (APPLAUSE) Well. Laura, to you. "I forgive you"! (VERSI DI ESU LTANZA) (BARKING DOG) (VERSI DI ESU LTANZA) (Woman) Duce! (Woman) Duce, a question, please. Mrs. Bellini, a question. (Woman) Mrs. Bellini! Mrs. Bellini, does not seem immoral to liberalize fascism in this way? It seems to me that talking about fascism after more than 70 years it is out of fashion. Thank you.
