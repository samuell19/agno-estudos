Last week I was totally voiceless and that day I got a phone call from a sex maniac. And he was talking dirty. As a sex maniac he was doing his job. But I tried to react, I went like... After a while he said, "Excuse me, did I call you or did you call me?" "I can't figure it out." As a child I used to hide inside a cupboard in the dark and imagined the mischief I made. In my memories, though, I pretended I was another child, with another face, so that all the trouble I caused, which would have been a lot, would have been blamed on her, the one with the other face. You see, doctor, I'm in the car, and a group of cows crosses the street in front of me. I know that now, so I stop and let them pass. When I explain this to the guy who rear-ended me, because there's always someone rear-ending me, "sorry, I just stopped to let the cows pass," he gets pissed off. The doctor shakes his head. "I have known you ever since you were little." "You are only..." "You only..." "...need a lot of affection." As I was saying before this lady interrupted me… Stop drinking, alcohol is dangerous. I know! It's flammable. How much did you drink? No, I fell on purpose. I still have to refine it, but it works. Maria you can't go on like this. Look at you. If you keep on drinking, nobody will get you a gig anymore. Not even me. Who is this? It's me Dad... I wanted to know how it went tonight ... Real well, they're still laughing. Excellent, I'm very happy. Also because I understand that things are no longer going so well ... No way, dad. There was also a guy from TV tonight, they might have me back. I didn't tell you because I didn't want to jinx it. It's a good thing you told me, so I can sleep easy. Don't get home too late. I won't. I love you, remember that. I love you too, dad. Bye. Here we go, good morning. Good morning. Thank you. This is for you. Thank you. - Good morning. - Hi, sweetheart. Look at this, Maria is on this. Well, she looks good, doesn't she? Not bad at all. I think she would have looked better in colour. She's supposed to be funny, and not make all men fall in love in her. You noisy people, I can't even sleep. Maria, meet Maria. It's not the first time I get an article in a newspaper. You two are always holding each other's hand. Well, she's my girlfriend. When I was a child I thought it was to keep you both on your feet. How romantic! We love each other, and every morning I have a rose for her. When I was a child I was a little weird. My parents worried about me and they took me to the exorcist. I'm still a little possessed because I keep seeing Jesus Christ. So they took me to this priest who lifted my eyelids and said "This child is possessed." And I said: "Is that right? And by whom?" I already was somewhat slutty. So are you, I gather, right? "Listen, kid" said the exorcist, "Do you ever feel something inside giving you pain or cramps?" I looked at him, I looked at my parents and said... "Did you have to take me to see this idiot so he could tell me I have colitis?" Today we're at the stand-up comedian Maria Rossi's house. Tell us, Maria, how did you decide you wanted to pursue this career? Well, you see, if you were born where I was born, these would be your choices. Prostitution, alcohol, stealing or drugs. I had an aptitude for all of the above and couldn't make up my mind so I said to myself I would be a comedian, which is a summary of all four. My parents will confirm it. You came back late last night, didn't you? I had a gig in Piacenza. You sure have a funny job. You're out every night. You know who is out at night? The bakers. On Via Emilia there are also a lot of girls who are out at night. Yes, but they're not holding a mike in their hands. Luigi! When you are out and around, do people recognize you from TV? The other day, on the bus, at a bus stop, the driver got up and said: "Miss, Miss, aren't you…?" I took off my shades and said: "Yes, that's me!" "You're the one who didn't pay the ticket yesterday!" Dad! She's on the paper! And I paid a €60 fine, I should know! "I saw you on TV!" Mom, aren't you going to say anything? Mom? Mom? - Aren't you feeling good? - Mom? Mom?! Come on, mom! Mom! - You're not feeling well? - Sit upright, mom, sit upright. Come on now, please! Call an ambulance! Get up, get up, please! Get up, get up, please! You have anxiety, you're looking for help. "Lady, I'm not breathing. Maybe I'm dying." And she worries. "Do you have the oxygen tank?" Yes, in my purse, with the diving suit and an harpoon, what the hell are you talking about? The keys... Do you know what time it is? It's late, I didn't want to wake dad up. That's why you're always bothering me. It's not my fault if I work at night. Well, I work during the day, and so does my wife, and our child is sleeping. - Can I come in and say hello? - Where the hell you think you're going? How much did you have to drink? I'll put my shoes on and I'll drive you. Drive carefully. I will. Drive carefully! Ok! I'm not a child. Elena. Dad, it's me, Maria. I was asleep. What are you doing in my bed? Don't you remember I used to come here all the time? Of course I remember. It's been a long time and you still do. We're really progressing, aren't we? Let's sleep now. Yes, sweetheart. I have to get your mother a rose. Are you coming along? Sleep, honey. What do you mean last night? Wasn't it on Tuesday? How do I know I have to let you know if I don't even know I was supposed to come? What do you mean cancelled? You bastard! Shit! Fuck you! Where the hell are you? You bastard! Hey, cutie. What's his name? Buddha. Buddha... You hit my car! What were you doing still in the middle of the road? You're drunk! I'm calling the police! Do that! Find someone to get me out of here! Hi guys. Is it an involuntary commitment? Yes, Rossi Maria. We're coming from the hospital, she had a car accident, light bruises, severe alcohol intoxication and psychomotor agitation. We're off to a great start, uh? These are her personal belongings. Thank you. My glasses, my glasses. Thank you, guys. Have a nice evening. Are you drinking? Yes, please, gin and tonic. We're not doing stand-up. Take a deep breath and tell me what happened. I had an accident. I hit a Chinese. I see here that you had five accidents in the last two months. Blame it on the cows. Were they driving? Look, you ask the questions, I'll do the jokes. - That's enough for me. You may go. - We're done? Yes. No! I paid for those. My glasses, my glasses... I work with those. You won't be working here. Here, take these or I'll make you take them. No... No... Come on. Here we go, we're here. There's someone in here. Unfortunately we're all out of single rooms and suites. No, I'm not going to sleep with a stranger. The guest you're hearing is alone in her room, if you like you can go there. Come on, put on your pyjamas. Nurse, nurse, I have anxiety. Nur... Nurse. Nurse. You should be in your room. I was looking for you. Can you give me something? Why are you so agitated? Because they took away my medication. What's your name? Beatrice. I'm Maria. Now that we know each other could you give me back my medication? They put them in the second drawer. I can't. Dad, turn out the light, I was dreaming a nice dream. Dad! Everything you say will be used against you! Who are you? Hey, that's my bag. Sorry, but you just got here and maybe you brought some food. No, I didn't. And you should ask before you steal. Nurse! I want to leave, where do I sign? Where can I sign to leave? I want to leave. Calm down. Good morning, Maria. You can't leave, you have to stay here with us. You're in IT. I'm in what? Involuntary Treatment. Basically, you' re staying with us until the doctor will allow you to leave. You're going out but I can't. Yes, if that's how you want, yes. Can you put out? I can light up. Sure, lighting up is easy, I can do that too. Wrong answer. You have to put me in another room, with someone normal because this is... You put me... She's out of her mind. What do you mean by "being out of her mind"? She has no sense of reality. And what is reality for you? You're not even listening to me, you asking me questions based on my last word. Ask me something about "word" now. Look, Maria, we're treating patients with addiction problems here, just like yourself. I'll see at group therapy. Meaning? Please, let my next patient in. No, I'll take care of myself, I do monologues, it must mean something. I won't be attending group therapy. Who wants to start? Me. Hi, I'm Rosa. - Hi, Rosa. - Hi, Rosa. My problems started with an eating disorder, I was always hungry. I even ate dry dog food once. Two bags. It's not bad at all. Then a friend advised me to take amphetamines. I lost my appetite but they caused me a lot of problems. Now I'm here to get treatment with plenty of good intentions. But now this lunatic comes along calling me a thief for no reason... I have nothing to do with your problems. I lived with the gypsies for six months, they taught me all of their tricks. If I wanted to steal from you, you wouldn't have noticed. Who told you anything about this? Everything you say will be used against you. Not again... Maria, Maria... Maria what? Leave me out of this. You are already involved in this, you nasty pervert. I didn't even want to come here! Do I have to stay here and be insulted by these crazy lunatics? - I didn't grant you permission to get up. - And neither did I to ruin my life. I know what you're thinking. Are you a mind reader? No, but I thought about it too a couple of times when I got here. Go through that gate... ...leave. And then what? Then what? They'll find you and bring you back here, or somewhere worse. Worse than here? I can assure you, I've seen a lot worse than this. Why are you here? What is your problem? I'm hungry, and I'm going to go eat. I'm a sincere guy... I'm a sincere guy... I'm a sincere guy... I'm a sincere guy... You can't sing his song. Salt is bad for you. It raises your blood pressure, 160, 180, 200, 220, 240. Stroke, cerebral haemorrhage. Salt is deadly. I will not be complicit in an assisted suicide. Alright, I only wanted to see what it tasted like, if you know it, you avoid it. Shall we patch things up? You're not eating that apple, right? No. No, don't give it to her, you can't. It's against the rules. Everything you say will be used against you. She was going to give food to a patient with an eating disorder. It's an apple. It's no small thing. The apple is the symbol of sin, of sinful women. You nasty pervert! I may be a slut but I'm honest and if I said I'd give her this apple I will. Hi. I'm Luisa. Maria. I was at group therapy... Never mind that guy, you know, he's got a few problems. Have you been here long? It's been a while. I noticed that you know that guy. Could you go tell him that I need to have sex with him? No, no, wait, wait, listen to me, please listen to me. I suffer from a compulsive addiction to sex, ok? Some people need alcohol, heroin. I throw a fit if I can't have sex. So you're the one who yells at night. Yes. With all the pills they have around here, didn't they give you anything? Don't they have an anti-screw? No, and even if they did they wouldn't give it to me. I'm begging you, get that guy to me. I'm afraid I'm going to throw another fit. How am I supposed to do that? The head nurse is here. Please. Just because I want to sleep at night. Do you know that blonde? That's the sex addict who was advised total abstinence in group therapy. I'm afraid she's not really following their advice because she wants... With me... with all the men who are here it has to be me. I'm a sincere guy, I'm a sincere guy. Well, it's no joke. She's sick, it's something serious. I know she's sick or she wouldn't be here. Ok, tell her... I'll wait for her, room 24. The farthest bed from the door. Mind you, not the other bed because that's where Giulio sleeps. That's Giulio, she better not wake him up or it will all go awry. Maria Rossi. I got some fruit. It's really nice here, I'm sure she will be fine. It looks like a five star hotel. Yeah, only you can't get out of here. Look at these two good looking guys. Hi. Hi. I told you to drive carefully. But I'm perfectly fine. As soon as you drop this addiction of crashing my cars I'm going to get a disposable one, or we could ride bicycles. Don't worry about a thing. We should all make sure he doesn't have to worry. It wasn't my fault, a Chinese hit my car. Sure, a Chinese hit your car, alright. Damn... Come on, don't fight. No dad, you know we only fight with love. Screw you, Maria... with love, dad. Listen, I brought you a change of clothes, mom would have done it better, but... It's perfectly fine. How are you doing here? The food is good, my room is clean. How are you guys doing? To distract him I took him dancing, and he ran away. You ran away! He took me to a nursing home full of old widows, horrifying. I was used to my girlfriend. The place was filled with old hags so I ran away. Good morning, Maria. It's time for your therapy. Well, go on, now, if you're busy we'll get going. I'm fine. Look, Maria, we're here for you, but stop your bullshit. I told you I'm fine, go. Bye. Who the hell are you? Giulio. Help, help, hel... Shut up. It's late. Go get some sleep. What's wrong? Everything I say will be used against me. Words of wisdom. If we're here... ...it's because we can't seem to forgive ourselves. Maria. What are you doing here? Put down that piece of glass. Put it down. Four. Four times? Brando is a real powerhouse. No, no... Claudia, Claudia, Federico called! You have to call the doctor at once, we have an emergency! But that's the night shift nurse, what happened? What happened to the nurse? She's not a nurse, she's not. She's a patient. I found her in the washroom. She broke a glass, she broke the mirror, she took a shard to cut herself up. Why do you have blood all over yourself? Where were you? Weren't you with... I spent two hours, two hours trying to convince her not to do it. She wouldn't listen to me, I'm useless, totally useless. I can't even save people. Everything I do turns to shit. I got shit all over myself! I've been having shit all over myself all my life, this is a shitty life, I can't take it anymore, I can't take this anymore, I can't! Let me go, let me go! It wasn't your fault, it wasn't your fault, come on now. I know it wasn't my fault, I did nothing! Plume in the summer wind, waywardly playing Never one way swaying, each whim obeying. Plume in the summer wind, waywardly playing Never one way swaying, each whim obeying. Next! Next! Maria Rossi. Did I tell you that I saw you on stage? No. That time when you fell off the stage. In what town? I did that gig a lot of times. Don't hide behind a joke. Some ugly things happen in here. Yes, I'm sorry you had to see that. But if you had stayed in your room to sleep you wouldn't have been involved. That girl Beatrice, I really thought she was a nurse. I'm so anguished. Look, this is the toughest time. It's the withdrawal syndrome. But in fifteen days you will be much better. All these symptoms, even anxiety, will go away. Fifteen days? You must be nuts too. Don't you know that one day in here is like one year? Listen, you should take this as a way to challenge yourself. Every night you should tell yourself: "Another day went by and I did it." What kind of challenge is that? I can't sleep, I'm shaking. When did you start drinking? Do you need to know the exact time or the day will do? When did you start drinking? About three years ago. And what happened three years ago? I'm not sure. No coat tonight. Why the uniform? I actually studied to be a nurse and I liked that. Then my daughter was born and I quit everything. Now they're taking her away from me. Who is? My husband and his family. They're a bunch of jerks. It figures, it really takes a bunch of jerks for protecting their grandchild from someone with a borderline personality, depressed, addicted, alcoholic, pathological liar and suicidal. Hey, whose side are you on? Watch it, everything you say will be used against you. - Hi, Beatrice. - Hi. During the day they don't let me do the cleaning and at night they send me to bed. When can I do it, if not now? It's the third time I get hospitalized and she's always here. The third time? Every time I slash my veins, yesterday was my fourth time. There must be something wrong in the way you do it. I can't function without my daughter. I can't function if I don't make people laugh. But one year from now... you will be with your daughter and you'll be a famous stand-up comedian. She always gets it right. Last time I got hospitalized she kept telling me "Troubles always come in threes." And here I am again. Plume in the summer wind, waywardly playing Never one way swaying, each whim obeying. Carmine, be careful with the blowtorch! Don't overheat the beam! Renato! Renato! Dad, what are you doing here? Nothing, I took the bus. Bus? It's a nice framework. All the industries of Reggio Emilia used to be here. - That's where grandpa used work. - Grandpa used to work here, I know. What are you guys building here? We're building a cultural centre. And for research. See that you do remember? What did you come here for? I'm a little worried about Maria. When you have time we'll go to the hospital, we'll sign and take her home. What are you talking about? Yeah. Look, dad, Maria must stay there and not only because she is legally constrained to, she's doing fine there. If you're busy, I'll sign, I'll take the bus with her and take her home. If you're busy, I'll sign, I'll take the bus with her and take her home. What are you talking about? What are you talking about? That's the right place for Maria, there's a doctor, a psychologist, a treatment. We couldn't do what they do. No, that's not a good place for her. Maria is not doing fine, they just repair stuff like you do here with a hammer blow. What if this should break Maria? Where would I find another Maria? I need a signature, please. I'll be right with you. Dad you stay here, it's dangerous to be moving around. - Hello. - Hello, good morning. - Here you go. - Thank you. Bye. - Here you go. - Thank you. Bye. - Thank you. - Have a good day. - Thank you. - Have a good day. Dad? Dad? Dad... Hi. I was in this area and I thought I would come and see you. You look good. Look at you! A leather jacket, you look like a fire-fighter, a T-shirt with a kingfisher, you really want to look like a kid. Since mom's gone you really seem lost. Yes. What a good looking gentleman. It's my father. Would you like a blow job? Don't get offended, but no, thank you anyway. I'm good at it, you know? I don't doubt that, at all, and I thank you very much, but as they say, we closed shop. I'm always available. She's very kind. She has a sex problem, she's here to get treatment. Yeah, but I think they gave her the wrong medicine. How are you dad? Are you eating? Maria... Do you want me to get you out of here? Hello. Good morning, can I help you? I'm Maria Rossi's brother. Nice to meet you, I'm doctor Brizzi. I think your sister is in the garden. I think your sister is in the garden. Thank you. Thank you. Let's go, come on. My daughter is with my husband and his parents. Yes, the lawyer is doing what he can but the problem is the more I act foolish the more I'm losing her and the more I'm losing her the more I act foolish. How is your husband? He's handsome and he loves our girl. And he loved me. I'm the one who did everything to drive them away, as if I was fleeing happiness, as if I didn't deserve it. A Russian spy told me something like that once. Rosa... Oh you're always complaining about everything. No, get off there, get off, get off! - What's her problem? - I think it's the chandelier. Her husband hanged himself on a chandelier. And she was there, but she was so stoned she didn't even notice. - Need anything? - No, thanks. That's why she went berserk. The guilty feeling. We can't seem to forgive ourselves. Yes, did you add up? No, I'm doing that now. It was in the summertime. We had just left a party where we drank a lot, but what else you're going to do at a party? We all drank except my girlfriend. I had a girl who didn't drink. She was driving and we were fine. We were. But not the truck driver who crushed us in a tunnel. My girlfriend and the other two died. I don't know why or how I survived. I don't even know if it's a good thing. The problem was that the flames, before I could extinguish them made a mess down there. I'm out of use. And sometimes I get furious, mainly against myself. And whenever I exaggerate they lock me up in places like this. What a waste. I'll never forget you. Are you crying because he's leaving? No, because I know that I will forget him like all the others, in a minute. I was looking for Beatrice, I thought she'd be here. No, she went out. She had the authorization of the court to see her child. Her husband came to pick her up. She'll be back in the afternoon. She must be so happy. That's good news. Thank you. Maria... Don't let yourself get too involved with Beatrice. My mother. I beg your pardon? You asked me when did I start drinking. When my mother died. Try to be in control. Last time Emma got frightened. There's a cuddly toy in here, it's a puppy. It's sort of a promise, tell her that when you'll feel better you'll get her a real puppy, ok? - When will she be here? - Soon. My father will bring her. I wanted to see how you were doing first. Don't worry. I need to go to the toilet. Thanks, dad. Sit down. So? I'm fine. How did it go? You look so pretty. Do you have any children? Yes, I have two. They live with my husband. Yes, I have two. They live with my husband. You split up. You split up. You know, he tried to help me at first but... Love is not enough. No, I also have one more problem. My glass is between my thighs, always at hand. At least you're not causing trouble. Yeah, I wish I was not. Last year at my children's school at the Christmas party... I screwed Santa Claus. Santa Claus? No... But that's not all. Do you know who was hiding under that beard? My father-in-law. Talk about trouble. You screwed your father-in-law dressed as Santa Claus? You need to get treatment. Why? Where do you think we're at? I'm smoking too today. I should have went with her to the toilet, I didn't think about it. Don't worry, we'll take care of her. I trusted her for the umpteenth time. Come on Beatrice. We'll take care of her now. Bye, see you soon. I'm not sure you'll be seeing me soon. I am a sincere guy... I am a sincere guy... I am a sincere guy... When I explain this to the guy who rear-ended me, because there's always someone rear-ending me, that I just stopped to let the cows pass, he won't believe me. Did I ever tell you I ran away after I was kidnapped when I was a child? I know you don't believe it. They had locked me in a cave, I was terrified, but I managed to get through the sharp rocks, and finally, even though I hurt myself, because I did hurt myself, I managed to escape. Maria, it's late, you have to go back to your room. In five minutes we're turning the lights out. And Rosa, you got that scar when you fell from your bicycle when you were a child. Your mother told me that. Good night. Get down, Fausto, I don't know what I should put out. Wrong answer. Can you put out? Can you put out? Come on, get down. You can put out? It's dangerous. Do it for me, do it for me. Good boy, good boy, come here, come see your friend Donatello. I was looking for my daughter, they wouldn't let me take her mouthwash. It probably had ethanol in it, alcohol... See how easy that was? Can you put out? Listen Mister Rossi, before I call Maria, would you like to talk to me about your daughter? Maybe in my office? Yeah, but we have this nice garden, why shouldn't we enjoy it? - After you. - Why not? Good morning Princess, no dark circles, no wrinkles, I want the sleep therapy too. What did I miss? The North Pole has melted, They've set up vending stands on the beach in Reggio. Everybody's asking me: "What about your friend?" But are we friends? My husband wrote me a letter, but I don't have the guts to read it. Would you read it? Are you sure we want to get into this? If we can't take the distress we might slash our veins. Maria, please, just read it. Dear Beatrice, the last encounter with our daughter was very painful. I was angry, disappointed. I didn't want you to see Emma anymore. Then, on my way out, I was stopped by a nurse. Someone who knows you well. She reminded me that everything you've been through as a child left you so fragile that you always feel unfit to deal with situations. And I realized that you drank because you couldn't stand the thrill of seeing your daughter after so long. That you just wanted to be at your best. I apologize if for the umpteenth time my weariness took over. If knowing that our child and myself will wait for you, can give you the strength to move on, I want you to know that we are here. We love you. Young ladies, what are you doing here? And no, you can't smoke in here. Maria, look, your brother asked if he could take you home to have dinner with your family. I said yes. It must be snowing, the doctor trusts me. I trust you... I trust your brother. But you must be back by 10pm, 10:10 at the latest, at the very latest. If she lets you go home so easily, you will be out of here for good in no time. Really... You think so? Yes. And you will forget all these lunatics. How will you remember me, Maria? As the idiot who couldn't even commit suicide? You are somewhat idiot. When did Lidia say that I will be a famous comedian and you'll go live with your daughter? Next year. Make ourselves a promise. What day is it today? No idea. - You're awake! - What day is it today? February 21st. If we don't see each other again, a year from now, on February 21st at 9pm we'll meet in Piazza San Prospero in Reggio. It's a promise. Cut. I have to get cigarettes, a carton, and some chocolates too, because it's so sad in here. But you're paying for it. Yeah, I'll pay for it, don't worry about it. And I also wanted to get a present for your daughter. I'll pay for that too, it's going to be an investment for the future. You're a real smart aleck, what happened? Mister Rossi, I'm sorry, I forgot, you're supposed to fill this form. I thought she wanted to get me back in. Hi, dad... Who is speaking? Here we go. When were you going to tell me that dad is in the hospital? It happened this morning, I was going to tell you now. We were at home and he tried to call you with the TV remote. What's this got to do with anything? His phone looks like the remote. That's what I'm saying, it's nothing. I just told him it would be wiser to have him checked at the hospital, that's all. Come on, let's go! Hi, dad. Why did you take her here? You were supposed to tell her I went to the beach. I don't like this kind of jokes. I feel stupid, like I'm being an idiot, I don't know, it's a little weird... I feel stupid, like I'm being an idiot, I don't know, it's a little weird... I'm here now, I'll stay with you tonight. I'm here now, I'll stay with you tonight. Maria, you have to go back to the rehab centre tonight. No, I'm staying here and that's that. - Maria, your brother is right. - No, no. Come on, you have to go home. No, I'm staying here. No, look, you have to go home, I'm sorry but you have to. As a matter of fact, where are my slippers? - Dad, you have to lie down. - Lie down. No, no, I'm going home too. - No, you can't go home. - I have to go home! Come on, you guys are so messy. Where are my slippers? Dad... I have to go home to your mother. - Come on, let me get up. - Dad, please. Get my clothes in there, come on get my clothes, dammit! Don't get upset, dad. Lie down. Doctor, I'm Luigi Rossi's daughter. When can I take him home? When are his tests over? When can I take him home? When are his tests over? No, look, I'm sorry, his clinical picture is really bad. No, look, I'm sorry, his clinical picture is really bad. His cerebral ischemia is constantly worsening. I'm afraid, you'll have to be prepared for the worst. His situation is serious. - What are you saying? - I'm sorry. What are you sorry about? Renato, prepared for what? What are you sorry about? Renato, prepared for what? He says I have to be prepared, but what for? Dad is just fine. He says I have to be prepared, but what for? Dad is just fine. - I want to talk to a doctor... - Calm down. - This guy must be the janitor. - They're really good here. No, I want to take dad to another hospital. Where did you leave your mop? - Don't raise hell in here. - Where's the head physician? He's the head physician! Maria! Are you nuts? I was worried sick, you are under my responsibility. You lied to me, you said he was just going to be checked. - Listen to me, have you been drinking? - No, I haven't, stop it. - The doctor already called me four times. - Who cares! - It should be her again. Here she goes. - Tell her I'm not going back. - Hello? Yes, we're on our way. - I'm not going back. I'll put her on the phone. I'm not coming back in rehab, I'm staying with my dad. - You have to come back as soon as possible. - No, I'm staying out. I'm going to make you come back if I have to send an ambulance for that. Send the police, send the fire department, send who you like, I'm not going back, I'm staying out. Yes, no, everything's fine, yes... What are you looking at? Where is that nasty... Where is she? Where is she? Stay calm, calm down. I was trusting you, you don't give a damn about me, you don't give a damn! Is your show over? I do what I like, you got it? Whatever I like. There's only one man who can still tell me what to do or not to do. And that's my father, you got that? Maria... Maria, your dad would be glad if we talked. Perhaps not in here, we have a beautiful garden. You never told me why you came to see my show. It was my husband's idea. I didn't feel like it, I was very tired that night, but I went. To go see a Maria Rossi show you really must be in love. Well, I actually did it for love. What does loving mean to you, Maria? I love my mother, my brother, my father, but I wouldn't know what love is. Do you know? Loving is complicated, but I think it also means letting people we love go. Your mother is gone and you have to have the courage of letting your dad go as well. I'm scared. I know, And so does your father. Your dad knows you pretty well. I'm going to the cafeteria, can I get you anything? Good morning. Hi. Are you staying in this 5 star hotel too? It feels good here, it's nice, the food is good. I'm waiting for my children. The boy is doing fine, but the girl gives me cause for concern. You worry about her? Her job keeps her travelling. She's always out, night and day. Sometimes she earns some money, sometimes she doesn't, most of the times she doesn't. Since her mom's gone, I only have her left. Maria, you're Maria. Oh my God, I really am turning stupid. No, you're not. No, you're not. I didn't recognize you, Maria. I didn't recognize you, Maria. Maria... You just woke up. How do you do? You're getting upset. And you also forgot to say that your Maria has a few problems. One day if I won't be around Maria might fall apart. I won't fall apart, dad. I'm in a rehab centre, I'm getting my treatment. I'll stop drinking. I can't promise you anything. Say it again, say that again. I can't promise you anything. You said: "I'll stop drinking." You've tied yourself to the mast, you can't drink anymore now. I'm screwed, uh? I love you very much, to death. If there's someone who should die that's not you. Stop getting in the way. Hi, I'm Maria. Hi, Maria. I'm an alcoholic and I also pop lots of pills. I thought I also had an addiction to my glasses,, but maybe that doesn't count. I noticed it at my father's funeral They all had glasses ... Bye, Maria! Ma'am, I brought your juice. Maria? Ma'am? Maria? Maria! Maria! The show must start now. I must come in, it's important. I must see Maria, it's important. Please, let me see her. It's 9 o'clock, please. The show is about to start. - One minute! - The show is about to start. God... God... God of the alcoholics, I know you're there to protect me, but who is going to protect the beers from me? No, no, God, you can take a break because my brother's here, he's going to protect me. The thing that will stay with me forever is that when I was discharged from rehab, the doctor said to me: "Maria if you get out of here" "you're either crazy or you're cured." I think I'm cured. Am I crazy? Maria Rossi, after 10 years of alcoholism, Maria Rossi, after 10 years of alcoholism, ended her rehab, to resume her life and her stage. ended her rehab, to resume her life and her stage.
