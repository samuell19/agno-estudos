- Hey, Emma, you already for break? - Mm hm. - Remember, dorms close tomorrow at noon. - Wait, I can't stay here? - Well normally you could, but they're replacing a furnace, so no heat. Wouldn't want you to freeze to death. - Okay. - Did you not see the flyers? - Oh, right, I did. - And you have a place to crash, right? Sam, Sam, we just painted those walls. Oh, Emma, merry Christmas, come on in. - Got you a... - You silly. Come in, come in. You remember Mike. - How's it going? - I have your notes, too. You lent them to me, for our early childhood class. - Oh, well, thank god I'll never have to take that class again. Um, I was just wondering if, um... Your tree's pretty. - We got it this morning. Mike got in last night. - Is Mike staying here over break? - Probably won't budge from this spot. - Except to help me cook and to go Christmas shopping for your family. - Um, well, I was looking for a place to... You know, the dorms are actually... - Oh, Emma. - Merry Christmas. - Hi, um, can I have some hot water and, um, a plain bagel? - Yeah. - Thanks. - No, Martha, this isn't gonna work. No, you are not hearing me. No, Martha they are not old enough to stay alone. Neither of them even has a driver's license. How the hell am I supposed to find somebody now? No, no, you know I have been going forever, you know that. And I am not going to stop now! Well, merry fucking Christmas to you, too. You know what? I want an Irish coffee. All right, a vente nonfat, no foam, no water, six-pump, extra hot chai tea latte. - What size? - Really? A large. Oh, Christ. Breathe. Breathe, breathe, breathe. God, what a nightmare. Who knew people would be so unreliable? Can't get good help these days. Oh, he likes you. - He's cute. Well, he's been driving me crazy all week. He just can't get enough attention. Did you just ever have a week where everything that could go wrong did go wrong? - Yeah. - I mean, is it too much to ask to just get away for a few days? I mean, that's all I want, you know, just a little sunshine, get away from my kids. Just a little me time. - No, that doesn't seem like-- - Martha can be so selfish sometimes. I mean, it's, we had it all set up. We do it like this every single year, and now it's just so last-minute. Oh, and now she tells me she doesn't wanna do it anymore at all. I mean, I'm leaving, like, tonight. What a nightmare. So are you a student? - Uh, yeah. - What are you studying? - Elementary education. I wanna teach math. - That's interesting. What year are you? - Senior. - Fun. So, what are the plans for the rest of your life? - Well, I'm gonna student teach in the spring and then hopefully I'll get a job after. - What about break? What are you doing for break? - I have a lot of work, so I'll probably just hang around here. - Papers and stuff? - Yeah. - Okay, here's a nutty idea, what if you stay with Ralph? And my kids, of course? Okay, all right. That's crazy, I mean, I don't even know you, right? Um, just forget I said it, it's just distress talking. Sorry. - Sorry. - Oh, answer it, answer it. You know, I'm not goin' anywhere. - Hello? - Emma, I've been trying to reach you. - I know. Just a minute, mom. Sorry. - It's really starting to get old, Emma. - Mom, I'm fine. - No, you're not. I called the school and they told me students can't stay over break. You lied to me, Emma! You come home. - No, I just have too much work. - That's ridiculous. Emma, I am trying to stay calm. - Mom, I told you, it's just not gonna work. - Emma, you're being silly. You know what the doctor said. - Mom, you're just gonna have to take no for an answer. - The grief you cau-- Well, here we go. - I, I have a place to stay. - Emma. - Mom, I'm fine. Really, don't worry. - Emma, it's just, you are pushing-- - Okay, bye. Hello? Hello? Hey, boy! Hey, Ralph. Hi, buddy. Wanna go outside? Come on, boy. Let's go outside! Hello? - So you're Emily. - It's Emma, actually. Whatever. I'm Chrissy, and I don't need your help, okay? I'm 17 years old and I can take care of myself. - Okay. Yeah, okay. - Oh, don't think so. You're upstairs. - Hi, I'm Emma. Are you William? Can I sleep up here? Thanks.

It's beautiful. - Just something I made up. Don't wait up. - What time is your bedtime, William? Morning, William. It's chilly in this house. Did you want a Christmas tree? We could go get one if you wanted. Chrissy. It's cold in here, right? - Yeah, sure. - Yeah, I think so too. Where's the thermostat? - Basement. Do you wanna know, or is this your pathetic way of making conversation? - Yeah, I was just gonna go check. You know, it's not that bad by the fire. - I'll be in my room. - William. I was just looking for... Let's go downstairs, okay? - So, Emma, you're like my babysitter. - Yeah. - And so that means you need to do things for me. - Yeah, sort of. - Awesome. I need a pack of cigarettes. - I'm not gonna buy you cigarettes, Chrissy. - Why not? - Because. Okay. I'll get you cigarettes if you help William and I get a Christmas tree. - Whatever. How come I didn't know about this? Yes, I wanna go. I can't right now, I'm getting us a Christmas tree. I promised this girl. What? Who told you that? No, she's not my babysitter, just some girl watching my brother. She's weird. I wanna go, though, I'm in. Yeah, I told you. Yeah, I gotta go. - Do you like this one? - It's good. - It's really cold in here now. Chrissy, please? - What? So turn it up. - William, can you start a fire? Chrissy. Chrissy! Ready, William? Chrissy? - Hey, it's Tricia, I'm not here, leave me a message. - Hi, Trish, it's Emma, your babysitter. Some weird stuff has been happening and, if you could just, call me back or just come home. And, I don't mean to pry, but can William speak? - What's up? No, I think I'm just gonna stay here tonight. Yeah. I'm kinda thirsty. Oh, they're stale. - Yeah, they are. - Milk's good. - How did you learn to play so well? - Just listening. - Do you take lessons? - When I was little. - Do your parents play? Your mom? Your dad? - Oops, did I do that? Hey, you up for some mayhem? Yeah, I'll be there in five. - Hi, Trish, it's Emma again. I'm calling because, um, Chrissy broke... If you could just call me, please. - William. William. Did you put those light bulbs in my room? - Hey, it's Trish, I'm not here, leave me a message. - Losers, I'm home! Oh, good stuff, nice! Oh, I'm sorry, did I embarrass you? - I'm hungry. - Large pepperoni, no mushrooms. - Hey. - She's got it. - How much? - 43.58. What are you, nuts? - What? - $17 tip? - Right, I know. - Merry Christmas. - Oh, yeah, it's gonna be really fun. Well, 'cause everybody that's gone, they said it's awesome. I just don't know how to get there, though, because no one's offered to drive yet. - What are you drawing? - Why would you suggest that? That is literally the stupidest thing I have ever heard. - Could you talk later? - Oh, Jane has a car? Awesome. - I don't even like pizza. - No, I know, everyone that I've talked to said it's like the coolest thing I've ever seen. - Could you guys just stop? - Yeah, definitely, just text me whenever. Give me my phone, freak show. Emma? Emma, what are you doing? Give me my phone! Give me my phone! Give me my fucking phone! - What? What do you want? - Shit. - Overdose. Overdose! Just send someone! William? William? William? William? William? William. - Emma. Emma! - Okay. He's, um... he's okay. All right, see you soon. Mm hm, bye. She's on her way. She'll be home in a couple hours. - We would always put the ornaments on the tree, one by one. We could never decide on what tree we wanted, we could never agree on the size. One year, at the mall, there were giant piles of snow and he just climbed on them and sang Christmas carols to everyone. On Christmas, he'd make us wait at the top of the stairs and he'd go and check and see if Santa came. I don't blame her. I think the hole was just too big. - I knew it. - Yeah. - English? - Hemingway. - How's it goin'? - You know, good days... - Mm, bad days. - Yeah. - Your mom? She's trying. No, really, she's trying. How was class? - They're loud. I'm nervous.
