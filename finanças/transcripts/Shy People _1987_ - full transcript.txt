Why don't you go, Larry? I don't want to get my head blown off by some old crazy Sullivan. If you pardon my sayin' so, ma'am. They do that stuff? Head blowing off and everything? Well, now, miss, uh... Uh, all the people back in the Bayou, mostly they're Cajun... peaceful people. So the stories are exaggerated. Well, now, ma'am, uh, the Sullivans areamong the few who aren't Cajun. Uh, it's different. Uh, hell, I guess I could say they were a little, uh, shy. Shy. What are you guys talking about?

Henry here, he'll take you. Why can't you take us? Don't worry. Henry know the way. I hate to take people like surprise this way. You know, I hope they don't think we're rude not saying we're coming or anything? They know you coming. They do? How? Look over there. I don't see anything. You don't see them. They see you. Should we take our stuff? Oh, I don't think so. You'll wait? You paid me for it. Mrs. Sullivan? Are you Mrs. Sullivan? I just came to ask a few questions. I won't stay very long. The IRS sendin' out some funny agents this year. I'm not from the IRS at all. Really. I'm Diana Sullivan, this is my daughter, Grace. Joe Sullivan was my great uncle. Really, he was. Nobody gonna kick us off this place! No IRS, no National Park whatever it is, no Audubon Society. No, look, look, look. Here, take it. It's a picture of Uncle Joe and my grandfather. You a Yankee. There ain't no Yankee Sullivans. There are. - There ain't. Joe told me. - Well, look, if you would just look at the picture. Didn't Joe have a birth mark on his right hand that looked like a rabbit? Goat. Give it here. The little one's Joe, the big one's my grandfather Michael. What you want? We wanted just to talk about the family. Mom, this isn't gonna, work. This is ridiculous. What is her problem? Mother, she doesn't wantto talk to you. You're making an ass out of yourself. Where you goin' so fast? She's just doing this to humor you. Henry, you go on. You pick 'em up in a couple days. Pauli, you go get the--their suitcases. She's making a fool of you. She doesn't want to talk to us. Grace. Look at this house. Look at this house! I don't want to stay here, Mom. Stop it! Come on, come over here, sit with me. Come on. Come on, Grace. - Grace! - Mom! Come on. Wipe this off. Chicken stuff. It's my son, Pauli. Joe's and mine. Don't let him scare ya. He ain't no together with us. Oh, I'm sorry. You're sorry. God made him that way and god sure ain't sorry. He's your and Joe's son? You seem so young to have been Joe's wife. I was and I am Joe's wife. Took me as his second wife when I was twelve years old. It was after Jessie and the kidsburned up in the fire back by the church there. I don't see any church. Well, how in heaven could you? It burned up! The whole town burned up twenty years ago. You sure are an odd one. Where you say you from? Baltimore? Oh, uh, New York. That your girl? Yes. Yes this is my Grace. Don't talk much. That's what you think. Go away. That one doesn't either. - My daughter in-law, Candy. - Hi. Well, you certainly have a lovely wife. He ain't my wife. That's my baby boy, Tommy. Where's he? In the tool shed. Why is he screaming? He can't get out. Why don't you help him? I put him there. Why would I help him get out? Mama! I'm hungry! Let-let's go on inside. What did your brother do? Pauli's got a button missing. Don't you understand that? Now, Tommy's trouble. You know what his trouble is? Memory problem. He forgets who's his daddy. Make yourself to home. You know, this is reallyfascinating work here. My God. It's like some... combination of Grant Wood, Grandma Moses and Salvador Dali. Look at this! It's Joe. Oh, yes, of course. You see, we had him made that way. - Lookin' right at us. - Uh, huh. So we can't forget him and all he gives us. Oh, it's very functional. We like it. It's his place. Not a day goes by we don't give our thanks to Joe. All we got is from him. I said, it's his place. He sit in it every day. It's his. May we help you? Can't see as there's much you can do. Here is my place. Looks good. Bow your heads. We thank you, Lord, for this our food. For our health. And Joe, I know you're watchin'these nice kinfolk who come to see us today. They say they're from Baltimore-- - New York. - A Yankee's a Yankee but we say welcome anyway. - Amen. - Amen. - Amen. - Amen. Amen. Hmm... this is really good. Turtle soup. I had a turtle once. Ain't him. Oh, my God. Oh my god! Look at those two heads! Incredible. - They're fighting! - They're jumping! They don't know which way to go! I gotta get this on film. It's weird! - Oh. - Strange. Can you turn them around this way? It's so sad. This is not exactly Cosmopolitan-- I never saw nothin' like that 'till the oil companies come. That's when it all started happening. Ma! Come out here! - How bizarre. - Uh, two heads! Excuse me, very much. See this? It's the third time this week. They stole my crabs, all my craw fish and all but those stupid crabs. What the hell am I supposed to do, Ma? They got them big boats and they come at night. What the hell am I supposed to do against that? You don't raise your voice to your Momma, Mark Sullivan. I'm sorry, Momma. And about the poachers. What you got to do - is you gotta find that-- - On the way here today, we met a man with a boatload of crabs. I think he's supposed to be a poacher. Who's this? Kin, from Baltimore. It's my big boy, Mark. What kind of man was it? He was big, um... with a very husky voice. - His name was Jake. - Jake, right. But of course you couldn't prove it. It's him. Outsider. Minute he come around there was trouble. You can take care of that. How? You just think of what paw would it done. Then you do it. Uh, can't the police-- I think you should go on inside. Somebody's soup gonna get cold. We be along soon. I understand. All right, let's just sit down. ♪ My days have grown so lonely ♪ ♪ For I have lost ♪ My one and only ♪ My pride has been humbled ♪ But I am his, body and soul... ♪ - Yeah. - You won't. - Who's that? - You know, that's my grandparents. That's, uh, Melrose, my grandmother. And that's Sam. Oh, she's got your jaw. She's Irish. - And then, there's Joe. - Great looking. - See him? - Oh, he was a scoundrel. Oh, I don't know about that. - There's Joe again. - Uh-hmm. - Good looking. - You recognize who that is? Oh, You were so pretty. Oh, I don't know about that. - Yup. - I don't look like that - no more that's for sure. - I know, who does. That's Mark. Do you mind if I ask you... who this is? My dead son. Why is his... He's a sinner. Went to town. That boy's dead to me. Did you mean he's nearby? - He's dead, that's all. - You never see him? He dug his own grave, he can lie in it. That's ridiculous. That's the way it is. You're with us or you're against us. He went against us. But it--it's your son! He needs your warmth and support. Oh, you city people. You--you're all warm like dishwater. That don't do nobody, no good. What do you mean? I mean, you don't run hot nor cold. You should be one way or the other, hot or cold, that's all. Feel this, Mark. Come here! Pauli, come here. Wait. - Did you feel it? - That's nice. Come here. Wild! God! I mean, it looks like a dinosaur could come out of here. Can we go in here? It's Joe's place. Now Joe, he spent some time back here. Why? Well, one day he had words with old Carter Atkins. And Joe, he had his rifle by, and you can guess the rest. Joe killed a man. Oh, that time it sure got him in a mess of trouble. 'Cause Carter's wife, she was never one to let things drop, and she got the sheriff out after Joe and they kept up on it, too, even though they knew it was a waste of time. And Joe, he had to keep on runnin' I only seen him Sundays when I bring a basket. Right here. You mean, you knew where he was? Well, everyone knew where he was. They just didn't know when he'd be there. 'Cept me. He come to me... every Sunday. 'Till he stopped coming. I used to wait right here, till I saw his lantern light. What happened? He just never come out no more. I come here every Sunday for a year. Then I stopped. Funny. You have a live son you think of as dead, and a dead husband you think of as alive. Things I show they is, that's all. That's all. Psst! Psst! Hey! Hi. What's them bug-ears you got on your head? You've never seen a walk-man before? Well, here. No, it's okay. Here, listen. Listen. There, just relax. It's Elvis Costello. Guess that's all right! He doesn't know we can't hear us. - Hi. - Hi. You want a turn, honey? No. Well... here. - You guys ever get out of here?-CANDY: Come here, pup. Momma says it's all hell and high water out there. Yeah. We seen what's in town. Yeah. I bet you'd get out of here if you weren't so scared of your mother. I mean, listen, I understand. My mother's a drag. Just nag, nag, nag all the time. And yours... what a killer bitch. Be sorry you said that. My dad is watchin' you. He heard that. Wait a minute. This is crazy. Isn't he dead? Why don't you guys wake up? You're like slaves here. Don't you know there are places like Sweden, where kids can sue their parents for fuckin' them up? And you're here afraid of your dead father! What did you say this record was? You! You get back up to the house. Hear me? Now! No, it's okay. Jesus Christ. I don't believe it. What don't you believe? These people. They're crazy. Can we get out of here, please? Well, they-- they are odd. But Henry won't be back for two days, so. Anyway, I'm finding out amazing stuff about Joe. What a character. Uh, this is going to be the best story. What about the kid who's locked up in the shed? That is part of the whole thing. The ignorance, the superstition. Maybe we can help a little by being here. You know, teach them something. Yeah, maybe you think so. But it's like South Africa here. But, it's not South Africa. Mother, that woman is a slave driver! Well, that's too extreme. No. She's... I don't think they've ever heard of fun. Maybe their fun is simple. I bet their fun is stupid. And you have fun in enlightened and sophisticated ways. Do you know what I mean? Is going out with a forty year old man sophisticated enough for you? Now, exactly what is going on between you and Andre Zimbalm? Oh god! What a choice! I don't believe your nerve. That slick, underhanded, phoney, flashy... Well, you certainly liked him enough to fuck him. Come on, I know all about it. He told me. We share everything. Including his drug habit, am I right? - You spied on me. - Hmm. I was looking for my belt. - Yeah, right. - Uh! Listen to me, miss. I hate to tell you this but all I want is to help you, help yourself. Right now, my opinion of you is at an all-time low. Here. Take it, take it from me. I think you should take responsibility for this yourself. You throw it away. I mean, how am I supposed to trust you? I'm sure you've got it hidden all over the place. Don't put the responsibility on me. Please, just take it. No, no, no. What about the next time? You know, you're gonna have to live without a policeman standing at your back. You're a free person! So I'm free, then. Free. I can do whatever I want. I'll kill myself here. I'll give you a secret. When I was a girl, I was like you. I wanted to go, too. But Joe, he wouldn't hear nothin' like that. And then, somethin' happened to me. You know what happened? I started havin' my boys. And honey, when you look at the world with a baby in your arms, it looks so different. But don't you see? We could all live away from here. We could all go to town. If Mark worked on a oil rig, we could have a car. We could have electricity! This is where I am. And this is where I'll die. But there's nothing to do here! There's no radio... no T.V. I hate here. - I hate it. - All right, you can go to town! First baby is a frightening thing. You go to town. You go have that baby in town. But then you come right back here. I know you wouldn't leave me without the comfort of my own grandchild. What's the matter, I give you my word. All right! We'll find you a T.V. What'd I say wrong now? I told you I was goin' to get you a T.V. Where'll we plug it in? God will provide. Well, I think... God forgot about this place. I need some form of entertainment. You will never take my son from me. You will never take my grandchild from this house. Never! Do you hear me? Uh-hmm. Come here. Yeah, yeah, you, come on. Come over here. Come on, I ain't gonna bite ya. Anybody around? Okay. Will you hand me that key right there? It's that key hangin' right on there. Oh, oh, okay. That's it. Come on. - Where are we going? - I'll show you. - Wee! - This better be good. Oh god. It's so far! No it's not. No it's not. Yes, it is. Wee! Here's the tricky part. Oh god. Just got to grab this rope, swing down. - You got it? - Yes, I've got it. Sit down. Here. No. Thank you for letting me out of that shed. It was nothing, really. Can I steal you something to eat, or something like that? I ain't hungry. Oh. - How can you stand that? - What? Being locked up like an animal? I'm no animal. I didn't say that. Don't you ever want to live in the city? No. Well, do you have a girlfriend? I don't need no girlfriend. You better lock me back up in the shed now. Why? I don't wanna make my momma mad. Pa? Oh, god. Hush now. You don't got to look so pretty, you already got a wife. Can you hand me the scissors? Swear I'm gonna kill that Jake. Hold his head. Yeah, looks like he came pretty near to killin' you. Can't even keep hold of your own boat. Anything I can do to help? Okay, I'll go to the police with you. No sheriff. Hang on, it's the last one. Here goes. Oh, god. Hold still. Ah, god damn it! Does it hurt? You've got to dosomething to stop this violence. You have a right to police protection. Don't you see I can help you? I'm from Cosmopolitan Magazine! Do you know what that means? The Press! The police don't want me writing that they're not doing their jobs. You can go now, I'm done. Candy, Candy, you dress it. If Joe was here, Jake'd never mess with Sullivan traps. Nobody messed with us.

And the man that said that he is invaluable or that he has no sin be the liar for we know that there are many, many people that lie, and they call upon the name of Mary. Oh, how blessed Mother of God, I tell you this morning, when you look into the scriptures beyond the birth of Christ and Mary's part, you find something there about calling on God and calling on the Lord but never will you find about Mary. But where is Mary when we come to prayer? Where is our most priestly father, ah, when we come to pray? It's not there. Somebody.... Ruth, I have to talk to you about this. About Joe. How he treated you. Michael told me. This what John said, "I'll tell you this morning--" Michael told you. You find somethin' there about callin' on God and callin' on the Lord and-- Why don't you take your family away from here? And where is the mighty, priestly Father when we come to pray? You don't really believe all that about his ghost in the swamp? To the book and God shall add.... I don't believe. I know. Where is Mary in the scriptures? Where is she? She is missing in the scriptures where they're talking about the Virgin Mother of Christ. Of the Gospel according to Matthew, Mark, Luke and... Ma! Momma! He raped her! - Her-she had to run away!-MICHAEL: No! I didn't rape her! That little whore was in there with him. He had her in there. I knew what they was doin'. Pauli could tell you! Come here. - Pauli, tell-- - No. No. No! No! Momma! She gave him this dirty magazine and he was-- Don't hit me, momma! I swear on the bible-- What are you saying? Where is my daughter? Mark? Tommie had that girl in the shed, Ma. They was up to no good. We saw 'em! No! You liar! She's my girl! You hurt her! Ma? What's he sobbin' about? Would you get in-the house, now! I wanna know, I wanna know! Where is she? Where is Grace? - Where is she? - She run off when her - and Mark were playin'. - Oh, God! Oh, God! Grace! Grace! Grace! Grace! Grace! Grace! I wanna know what happened here. I wanna know! Ma, that girl done it. She give us this drug and it made me go crazy. - Oh, god! - Look, she scratched my damn head open again! What was that girl doin' in the shed? Oh, can't you understand? - He raped her! - No! I kissed her! And then she scratched me like some bobcat and run like hell, but she done it! She crawled in there with Tommie and gave him drugs and they went all the way. Just ask him. What do you think... your Pa would do to you for this? Please! Listen to me! She's out in the swamp! Pa would be mad! Fuck Pa! He's dead, god damn it. Can't you understand? He died 15 years ago and rotted out there in the bayou! - Ma, Momma? - Oh, don't you get it? What's he sayin' about Daddy? Momma? What's he sayin' about Daddy? Daddy, he don't mean nothin'! Don't listen him, Daddy! You take that back, Tommie! The fucking asshole's buried under a hundred tons of shit! - Stop it now! - No! He's dead! He's dead! He's dead, and you're a stupid old woman! Tommie! You shut up! Pauli? I want you to go find the key. I want you to open the shed. Grace! And Mark! I want you to go inside and I want you to teach your poor little brother... to show some respect! - You son-of-a-bitch! - Good! Good! Come in here! I'm gonna kill him! I'm gonna kill you, you bastard! You fucking bastard! Okay. Now, come on. Come on in here! Fight me! Fight me! Come on I'll fight ya! I'll fight ya! I'll kill you! Don't say that about Pa! Mark! Dead! He's dead. He's dead! He's dead! My daddy's dead! He's dead. My daddy, he's dead. Daddy's dead. He's dead! Dead! - Dead! - No more. Momma, he's dead! Momma! I said no more! She's gone! She's gone. My baby's gone. Help me! Help me! Please, help me. Get some water and bandages. Now. My baby. Ah! Ahhhh! Ah! No! Grace! Mommy! Mommy! - Grace! - Mommy! Grace! Mommy! Grace! Grace! Mommy! Come! It's me! - Oh, Grace! - Please. Mommy! Oh, come! I'm here. My baby. I guess you ain't got too many nice things to say about us in that magazine of yours. Listen to me. I want to say somethin'. I wanna tell you what he was. Joe. I want to tell you how I hated him. It was more than Michael said. I'm the one that lived in Joe's hell. Me and my Paul. My Pauli, who he spoilt. He spoilt my little boy. On one night when even I believed the good Lord had forsaken us, the highwater burst the levery. Took everything, all the houses. It was 1966. I was carryin' Pauli. Sick as a dog. Scared. Joe come to the room, he pulledme out of bed by my hair. He was sayin' that, uh, if I didn't come out that without two more hands, we'd all surely die. But you see, I thought I was dyin' already. I begged him, on my knees, I swear, like I never beg 'cause I couldn't walk, I couldn't bend. So, he grabbed me up with one hand, and then I saw his fist. It was covered with mud, and he aimed it right here. This is where he hit me. It was right here. And then he hit me again. And I swear to God I heard somethin' go. I heard somethin' pop. And he dragged me outside and I worked. I worked against the water. And it wasn't 'cause I was scared the flood, it was 'cause I was scared of him. And I hated him, I hated him. How could he do such a thing? Because there would have been no child. There would have been no children. None of us. No nothing. If he hadn't a done it. You see, he was never a warm man. He ran hot and he ran cold. It was because of that he saved us. He saved us all. Now, you go home... and you write that. I'm not writing anything. I saw him, last night... - out there. - Joe? Yeah. The swamp makes a body see... whatever they wants to see. Do alligators actually eat people? I'm moving out. You're what? I'm gonna move in with Andre. He keeps asking me. No. No. What are you trying to be? Tough? I'll do what I want, remember? - Grace! - I'm busy! Grace, Open the door! I'm busy! Leave me alone! Grace! Leave me--shit! What are you doing? - I do what I want. - No! - I'm a free person. - That's over now. You! Bitch! I'm a free person! Oh! Ow! I'm the mother! You're the child! You're not ready for freedom! You know what I'm going to do? I'm having you locked up! You're going to be locked up with the junkies in detox! Excuse me, is everything all right? - Yes. - No! All right, go ahead and cry! Cry and think! And while you're there. I'll rent a house, a room, any kind of a place where I can see the gate, or see you in the yard or visit anytime they'll let me for a minute, an hour, anything, I don't give a damn! And when they let you out, I'll hold you in my arms. Oh, I'll hold you so hard... and so close and no one will ever take you away from me again. Or ever hurt you... because you're mine! You're my baby. You're my Grace. You're my Grace. I love you. Is the big deal behind Door number one, which opens up to reveal some bacon!
