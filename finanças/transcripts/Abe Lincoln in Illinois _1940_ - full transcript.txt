Snow all winter, cloudbursts all spring. Food just about gone. There's nothing in the ground coming up. If we stay here much longer. We'll starve. They're always saying the same thing Tom, no matter where we go. Pull up stakes and get gone, is all you think about. We got nothing to worry about, Pa. Rain don't last forever. Even if it stopped, you wouldn't notice it. Being as how you're everlasting got your nose stuck in some book. What you reading now? That book Squire Noble game me back in Indiana. It's called "Shakespeare". What in the name of tarnation mockery is that? Kind of poetry. Poetry? Hmm. My son. Maybe, if he ever gets time to get himself an education .. Maybe someday he'll write poetry. Over my dead body, he will. Well, it's settled. We're all ready to go. Go where? - Didn't Abe tell you? A boy named .. Let me tell the, John. You talk too slow. There's a trader named Denton Offut .. Wants me and John and Abe to take a flat boat of hogs down to New Orleans. He wasn't sure we was the men for it. But we convinced him. Good money? - Twenty dollars a month. Apiece. We're starting from a town called Springfield up the Sangamon river. When? - Right now. Come on, Abe. Yeah, if we don't hurry we lose the job. Who'd have thunk anyone in this family would ever make twenty dollars a month. So you're going, Abe? I guess I'd better do it, Ma. I know I can trust the old man to your care, Ma. And we can trust you, Abe. You're a good boy. I couldn't have loved you more if you'd been my own son. I'll always be thanking you Ma, for your great kindness to me. Wherever you go, whatever you do. You remember what the good book said: "The world passeth." "But he that doeth the will of God." "Abideth forever." I'll remember, Ma. Goodbye. Goodbye. Dear Abe. Last time I was down south they talked about an election in The United States. I tell you these suckers here don't know their own head from an ax handle. Why, I remember once when .. - There's a town over there, Mr Offut. Yeah. That's New Salem. A right pretty little place. Going to be bigger than Springfield someday. No, you don't. No, you don't. I got all my rag money and savings wrapped up in you little squealers. And I don't calculate to lose it in the Sangamon. Keel her over, Abe. Keel her over. Mill dam just ahead. Keel her over, Abe. Keel her over! Keel her over, boys. Keel her over. I'm a keeling. Never mind me. Get them pigs. My name is Abe Lincoln. And mine is Ann Rutledge. I .. I don't know the name of the pig. Well, where are you going with all those pigs? New Orleans. If we don't hit any more mill dams on the way. Do you live here, Miss Rutledge? Yes. I suppose it doesn't look like much to a travelled man like you. It looks like a fine place to me. Fine people. If you think I like to travel, you're wrong. I'm only doing it because I got to. Same as the pig. Hey! Hey! Oh .. I guess I got to be going. Goodbye, Miss Rutledge. I'm pleased to have made your acquaintance. Goodbye, Mr Lincoln. And good luck. 58 .. 59 .. 60. Looks like we got them all. Nice people them people. You know what. As soon as I get back I'm going to open up a store in that town. You think you'd like to work for me? Abe? Yes, sir? - Did you hear me? No, sir. I said I'm going to open up a store in that town as soon as I get back. Want to work for me? - Yes, sir. I sure do. Al I know about Denton Offut. I can bet you a coon-skin cap against your Sunday pants .. He don't show up in New Salem like he promised. Well if he don't, he don't. That's simple, ain't it. You got another interest in New Salem? - Nope. Don't know anybody. Well .. nobody excepting Ann Rutledge maybe. You know her? - Who don't. Her Pa owns the tavern. Where did you meet her? I was with a pig. She spoke to me first. They was pioneers in them days. And we didn't have no luxuries to live on like you got today. We didn't have no pickles and gravy and corn bread. No sirree. Prime salt pork was a Sunday dish in them days. What you eat on Saturdays, Ben? Beans? What's happening? - Election day. That's old Ben Mattling. He makes the same speech every year. But we didn't complain neither. We pitched in to the revolutionary war. We weren't no milksops like you are today. If the country is going to the dogs. Why don't you do something about it? I'm talking to you like a soldier. I have to plow this miserable country. Didn't you get no assistance from Washington and Jefferson? Shut up, Jack. Let him talk. Now what I want to know is this. How are you going to vote today? We'll vote as we gosh-darned please, you old windbag. Come on, boys. Let's go and get some liquor. Who's going to pay for it, Jack? - Who said anything about paying? In the year 1776 .. We stated the proposition that all men were created equal. And now look at us. You keep out here, you low scum, you. You'll get no liquor from me today or any day until you learn to behave yourselves. I believe I said we want liquor. Did you hear me say it, Mr McNeil? Now go easy, Armstrong. We don't want any trouble here. Oh? And what's more we won't have any trouble. Don't fight with him, John. No, John. Don't you fight with me. If you want to keep your health. Let him go I tell you. Afraid I might do something to that pretty face of your future husband? Never mind, Miss Annie. I won't damage him. If he is what you want, you can have him. As you ain't hospitality to invite us, I guess we might as well help ourselves. Come on, boys. The Cleary Grove boys are getting drunk. All of them. They'll break up the whole tavern. Can't anybody do anything? Can't you speak to them, Judge? I'm afraid Miss Ann, it wouldn't do a particle of good. You're right, Judge. Not a particle of good. I tell you, you all ought to listen to what the judge said. He's got a round belly but a level head. Nobody can do nothing with me without licking me first. If I was a might younger .. Easy, Ben. I'm the big buck of this lick. And any of you want to whet your horns, all you got to do is .. Give that hat a kick. Don't you dare to worry, Trum. Nobody will dare to damage it. You want a fight, stranger? Not particularly. Well if you change your mind, there's the hat. If I were a man, Jack Armstrong, I'd give you the thrashing you deserve. Well you ain't a man Miss Annie and praise be for that. You're a female and a pretty gosh-darned appealing one. Can't you see I'm the only man there is in the measly town? Leave go of me. I've changed my mind. Excuse me, Mister. But it had to be done. Better be careful, stranger. You're up against the greatest fighter in this town. Thank you, gentlemen. But we've all got to learn sometime. That's the spirit, Mr flop-ears. Shake hands? A pleasure. That was quite a hardy handshake. At least I admit it. When I was a boy I didn't like molasses and sulphur either but I .. Got so I could take it. Want another? Shouldn't be surprised. Watch out for his dirty tricks. Lick him stranger, and you'll be my friend for life. That's it. That's it, go after him. Are you satisfied? I'm satisfied. Also, I'm quite considerably surprised. So am I. It was an accident. - You didn't fight fair. Wrestle him again, Jack. - No, sir. No more wrestling with this long-legged son of vengeance. I'm here to admit to one and all. That New Salem has a new champion. Congratulations. Fine work. That was good work, Mr Lincoln. You're the man we've been waiting for in New Salem. Thank you for remembering my name. You've met before? In a .. sort of informal way. I hope you will be staying here - I hope so, Miss Rutledge. Looks like we must delay the voting. We haven't anyone to act as clerk yet. Here you are, stranger. - Oh, thank you. What's your name? - Lincoln. Abraham Lincoln. - My name is Joshua Speed. Glad to meet you. I'll introduce you to our leading citizens. Judge Bowling Green. How do you do. - Mr Mentor Graham, our schoolmaster. Glad to meet all of you. - Good afternoon. Can you write? I guess I can make a few hand tracks. Good. Then you can help tabulate votes. Give him the oath, Bowling. - Raise your right hand. Repeat after me. I, Abraham Lincoln do solemnly swear to uphold the constitution of .. Wait a minute, mister. What are you getting me into? We must put you to work for the government, Mr Lincoln. Oh no you don't. I don't want to be no politician. Nonsense. All you're going to do is to see that we get an honest vote. Come on now. Take the oath. Go ahead, Mr Lincoln. You're the only one those Cleary Grove boys will respect. Alright, mister ..? Gale. Seth Gale. Howdy. The same to you. I, Abraham Lincoln. Do solemnly swear to uphold the constitution .. Of The United States of America. Of The United States of America. Well, let's see now. I've got my hickory shirt. I got my pound of beans. And give me a pair of buckskin gloves. Ain't got no buckskin gloves but .. These are dog's skin. They only cost 75 cents. They look good. How do you know they are dog's skin? - I'll tell you how I know. Jack Cleary's dog kills Tom Watkins' sheep. Tom Watkins' boy kills the dog. Old John Morris tans the dog's skin. Sally Spears makes the gloves. That's how I come to know they are dog's skin. So that's how, is it. Well, I'll take them. But .. you'll have to trust me for the money. If anybody ever offered us cash in this store we'd drop dead. I'll remember that, Abe. When I trade here again. Abe. I'm a restless man. Got the soul of a gypsy. I feel the urge to pull out of New Salem. Why, I'm sorry .. - I want to show my appreciation. For the fine work you've done in my employ. No thanks are necessary, Mr Offut. I'm going to give you more than mere thanks, my friend. I'm going to make you a present of this store. Yes sir, Abe. It's all yours. Lock, stock and barrel. That's mighty generous of you, Mr Offut. - Not a word, Abe. Not a word. I'm making this gesture solely because that's the way I am. Goodnight, Abe. - But Mr Offut .. There is one thing that I hope you'll excuse me to mention. Just how much money do you owe here? I knew you was a smart man, Abe. Yes, sir. I've always been a shrewd judge of character. With your brain and energy you'll make a go of this store. And it won't take you long to pay of the sum of $1,500. Goodnight. Evening, Abe. Evening, Mentor. Let's see. Where were we when we left off? You said at this lesson we'd review the "moods". Ah yes, the moods. Every one of us has many moods. You yourself have more than your share, Abe. They express the various aspects. Now. Name me the five moods. Abe. Excuse me, Mentor. I asked you to name me the five moods. Oh. The indicative, the imperative .. Potential, subjunctive and infinitive. And what do they signify? - The indicative mood is the easy one. That just indicates a thing like "he loved" or "he is loved". The imperative mood is used for commanding, like .. "Get out and be danged doing it". Is that the best example you can think of? Well you can put it in the bible: "Wait until I go thou in peace" but it is still imperative. And the potential? Well, that just signifies possibility. Usually of an unpleasant nature like .. "If I ever get out of debt, I'll probably get right back in again." Debts keep piling up on you, Abe? I'm afraid it's my own fault. I'm my father's son. Give me a good steady job and I'll fail at it. You haven't been a failure, Abe. There's not a man-jack in this community .. That isn't fond of you and anxious to see you get ahead. I know it just like you, Mentor. Sitting up nights to give me learning just out of the kindness of you heart. And now Judge Green and Josh Speed. And a few others I owe money to want to get me the job of postman. Thinking maybe I can handle that seeing as there's only one mail comes a week. Well, Abe. There are always two occupations open to those who've failed at everything else. There is school teaching and politics. I'll take school teaching. You go into politics and you may get elected .. And then you got to go to the city and I don't want none of that. What did I say about too negative? - I meant any off that. What's your objection to the cities, Abe? You ever seen one? Sure. I've been down river to New Orleans. You know every minute of the time I was there, I was scared. I was scared of people. Did you imagine that they would rob you of all your gold and your jewels? No. I was scared they'd kill me. Why? Why should they want to kill you? I don't know. You are a hopeless mess of inconsistencies, Abe Lincoln. You understand, don't you, Ann? How long will you be gone, John? About 2-3 months. That's all. I'll miss you. Every minute of the time. This was my mother's. My father gave it to her when they became engaged. All you must ever think about. All I'll ever think about is that I love you. We are going to be wonderfully happy. Tell me that again. Tell me we're going to be happy. Hey, Abe. Have you seen this? The governor is calling for a troop of volunteers right here in New Salem. You'll be going won?t you, Abe? I don't know. It seems to me as if those Indians had a right to their own land. Yes, but if want to settle in Kansas-Nebraska territory .. And live in peace out there we've got to fight the Indians first. Just the way your own father did when he moved into Kentucky. What is it, Jack? We're all going to war, Abe. And we've elected you Captain. It looks as if they've made up my mind for me. Squad right wheel, march! Squad right wheel, march! Left .. left .. left, right, left. And they are known as Captain Abraham Lincoln's company .. Of the 1st Regiment of the Brigade of mounted volunteers. Yeah .. mounted volunteers. I'd hate to be a horse and have one of them galoots ride me. March! Jack .. I've forgotten the command that will take 'em through the gate end-wise. Don't ask me, sir. I'm only a Sergeant. Company, halt! The Company will break ranks and form again on the other side of the gate. Hey, Abe .. look! Anything for me, Abe? Yes, Seth. There is one from Maryland. Probably from your folks. 28 cents due. - Thanks, Abe. I'll pay you later. - Any time, Seth. Anything for the Rutledge family this morning? There is one for your Pa. Looks like a liquor advertisement. One from New York State for you. There is 34 cents due on it too. I haven't got my purse with me. That's alright, Miss Ann. The government can wait. Thank you, Abe. Very much. Good morning, Miss Ann. My, you're looking prettier every day. Good news, I hope. Very good, thank you. Ha! Catch me waiting two years for any man. I beg your pardon, Miss. Can you direct me to the home of Joshua Speed? Yes, it's the house up there with the morning glories. I think you'll find him at the tavern. - Thank you, Miss. I'm much obliged. Abe. Next to my old man, I think you're the homeliest critter I ever saw. There is a reason, Mrs Garn. When I was two months old I was the handsomest child in Kentucky. My nurse swapped me off for another one that was kind of plain looking. Hey, Abe. They wants you over to the tavern. Who does? Josh Speed and Bowling Green and one of them .. Dressed up fellows from Springfield. What do they want of me? - I don't know. But I can tell you this. I don't like the looks of it. But he's the best-liked man in this district. The very man we want. Maybe it will correct the public belief that .. The Whig party is composed only of the more privileged classes. Gentlemen. Abe, I want you to meet Mr Ninian Edwards. A mighty important member of our political party. Happy to know you, Mr Edwards. - Mr Lincoln, it is a pleasure. Sit down, Abe. We want to talk to you. Abe, how would you like to run for the State Legislature? When? - Now. For election in the fall. - Why? The Whig party needs a candidate from this district. You are the postmaster here which gives you valuable contacts. By delivering mail you can also deliver speeches and campaign literature. With which our headquarters will keep you supplied. Could you supply me with a suit and a store of clothes? Your candidate mustn't look too plain. And what's more Abe, in the legislature you get paid. Three whole dollars a day. Fine money alright. No denying that. I see what you're getting at, Bowling. I owe you a considerable sum. I'm not thinking about the debts, Abe. I know you ain't, Bowling. But I got to. I can see Mr Lincoln, that you're the type of man who can handle anyone. Hmm, even the Cleary Grove boys. Oh, I can handle them because I can out-wrestle them. But you can't go around Sangamon county throwing all the voters. You want to get an education, don't you, Abe. Well here is your chance to do it. In Vandalia you'll be associating with all the finest lawyers in this State. Important men like Stephen A. Douglas. You'll grow. I thought I'd growed too much already. Don't listen to 'em, Abe. Don't let 'em get you in politics. They'll corrupt you the same as they corrupt the whole danged United States. You are an honest man, Abe Lincoln. You're a good-for-nothing .. Debt-ridden loafer. But you're an honest man. Is that all you have to say, uncle Ben? That's all. And I hope it's enough. I kinda agree with him. Well Mr Lincoln, we don't demand your answer immediately. Think it over. Now gentlemen, if you'll excuse me. I have to put in an appearance at the torch light procession .. In Springfield this evening so I must be moving along. Just consider what it means. To be starting up the ladder in a nation which is expanding south through Texas. And westward to the empire of the Californias. It is opportunity, Mr Lincoln. Opportunity unlimited in scope. Goodbye, sir. Goodbye, Mr Edwards. A pleasant journey to you. Goodbye, gentlemen. - Goodbye, Ninian. Ann. What is it? That letter you got from New York State. What do you know about that letter? Well, I'm the postman. I guess I know more than I ought to about people's private affairs. But I couldn't help seeing that was the handwriting of Mr McNeil. Whatever the letter said it is no concern of yours. I know that but it makes me sad to think that something could have hurt you. If I could help you, Ann .. You know. When you're distressed about something .. It's a comfort sometimes even to have a pair of ears to pour your troubles into. My ears are big enough to hold a lot. You are a Christian gentleman, Abe Lincoln. No, I ain't. I'm a common sucker with a shirt-tail so short I can't sit on it. You can always something to make a person laugh, can't you. I don't need to say anything, a person just has to look at me. You were right about the letter, Abe. Tom says he doesn't know when he'll be able to get back to New Salem. By which, he probably means .. Never. I wouldn't say that, Ann. I would. Do you love him so much? I thought I did. But I guess I couldn't really love anyone who was as .. Faithless as that. You see. I can't help thinking what they're saying about me. All the old gossips all over town. Oh, just weakness, I guess. Vanity. Something you couldn't understand, Abe. Maybe I can understand it, Ann. I got a kind of vanity myself. I guess it's .. Nothing but vanity that's kept me from declaring my inclination towards you. I don't like to be sniggered at either. I know what I am and what I look like. I know I've got nothing to offer any girl I could be in love with. Are you saying you're in love with me, Abe? Yes. I am saying that. I've been loving you for a long time with all my heart. You see Ann, you're a particularly fine girl. But .. I don't want to worry you about it. I only thought if you'd do me the honor to keep company with me for a while .. It might shut the old gossip's mouths. They'd figure you'd chucked McNeil for someone else. Even me. Do you think I was too forward in speaking out as I did? No, Abe. I've always thought a lot of you. The way I thought you were. But the idea of love between you and me .. I can't say how I feel about that. But I can tell you this much now. And truthfully. If I ever do love you. I'll be happy about it. And lucky to loving a good, decent man. You will .. just give me a little time to think about it. You mean if you took time you might get in your heart .. Something like the feeling I have for you? I don't know, Abe. But I do know. You are a man who could fill anyone's heart. Yes. Fill it. And warm it. And make it glad to be living. What's the matter with you, Abe? You the guest of honor. Not dancing. I'd like to, but my feet won't work right. Ann Rutledge sure is acting gay as she knows. She is just trying to hide the misery in her heart. They tell me that locket is the one John McNeil gave her. She ought to forget him, I say. I reckon she wishes she could. Get some water, Abe. She's alright, Doc. The excitement was just a little too much for her. Here's the water, Doc. Thanks, Abe. She's be alright, Doc? Oh, I don't think there's need for any worry. Better be getting her on home. It's alright, Ann. I don't know what happened. I'm alright, Abe. I feel fine now. Ain't you noticed whether she's been ailing any lately? Well, she seemed kind of droopy, but we didn't think much of it. Why, do you think she's took sick? Oh, there is no cause for alarm, but .. Just to be on the safe side, I'll ride back with you. I was scared. You needn't be, Abe. I'm sorry I made such a fool of myself. You mustn't think of anything but winning that election. You've got to win, Abe. I'll be cheering for you when you do. Goodnight, Abe. Thanks. Goodnight, Ann. Goodnight, Abe. Down in Kentucky where I was born was pretty wild country. And wild people in it. I heard tell of a .. Woman who opened her door one day to see her husband grappling a fierce bear. It was a fight to the death and the bear was winning. The struggling husband cried to his wife: for heaven's sake do something. The wife asked: "What could she do?". Said the husband: "You could at least say something encouraging". But the wife not wishing to take sides in this combat hollered: "Go it, husband. Go it bear." Now that's the way I'll be if elected. I'll be like the man's wife. I'll cheer for everybody so I'm sure to be on the winning side. Where are you going, Abe? Come on, let's finish with the voting. We can't be all night about this. What does the doctor say, Jack? It's a brain fever, Abe. She's pretty bad. Thank you, Jack. Who are you voting for? - I'm voting for Abe Lincoln. That's good. Who you voting for, Trum? For Abe. Who? I said I'm voting for Mr Lincoln. You'd better. Therefore, his sister said unto him. Saying: "Lord behold". "He who now lovest is sacred." "When Jesus heart that." "He said." "This sickness is not unto death." "But for the glory of God." "That the Son of God might be glorified thereby." You have come to me. When I wanted you so much. Come close to me. Tell me we will be happy. We're going to be happy, Ann. I know I've got less than nothing to offer you. But whatever I am. Whatever I can be. My life belongs to you and it always will until the day I die. I love you. Oh, I do love you. I knew you would come back to me. Don't ever go away from me again. We will be happy. Abe carried New Salem by 205 votes to 3. My boys are out trying to find the 3 skunks who voted wrong. Get her tight, Fergus. Higher up Bob so we can see her. No you don't. I don't wear no soup kettle for nobody. You ain't no better than Abe Lincoln and he's wearing one. Alright boys, here we go! Down to Judge Green's house to pick up the new legislator. They are coming, Abe. "A large mass meeting in Boston Massachusetts." "Many orators paid tribute to the heroic memory of the late Elijah Lovejoy." "Thousands of New Englanders shouted .." "He shall be avenged." I wonder what the great Stephen A. Douglas has got to say to that. The great Stephen A. Douglas has this much to say. Freedom of the press is all very well until liberty becomes licensed. Lovejoy's life would have been spared if he'd listened to the dictates of reason. Instead of his own rip-roaring fanaticism. But .. Perhaps my good friend Abe Lincoln doesn't agree? I agree that Lovejoy should have listened to reason. If he had to be silenced I'd have preferred it had been done by the law. Instead of a crowd of bloodthirsty killers. Still straddling the fence, eh? That won't help you to get re-elected. I'm afraid nothing can help me. I'm not running. You are quitting the legislature? - Yep. Why Abe, I'm distressed. We'll miss you. Sorry to cause you distress, Steve. What will you do, Abe? Judge Stuart has offered me a chance to work in his law office in Springfield. Of course, I don't know much about the law. But there is one thing I've learned here in politics. That is .. Ignorance is no obstacle to advancement. In fact, in some cases it's quite an advantage. Good day everybody. Hello Billy Herndon. - Hello. Hello Billy. Nice day isn't it, Mr Herndon. Why, yes it is. Where have you been, Billy? I had to go downstairs about that writ in the Wilcox case. If you only went downstairs, why'd you wear your hat? As a matter of fact I stopped in at the Chenery House saloon. Careful, Billy. You got great fires in you but you're putting them out fast. Yes, sir. I saw Ninian Edwards, sir. He invited you to his party this evening. It's getting quite a habit with him. What's the occasion this time? He wants you to meet his sister-in-law Mary Todd, who's arrived from Kentucky. You don't say so. Well, I am becoming a social success. Yes, Mr Lincoln. You are. And I'm afraid you enjoy it. The Todd family are mighty high class people. They spell their name with two "D"s. Which is pretty impressive when you consider one was enough for God. Good evening, Mrs Edwards. How stunning you look in that magnificent new gown. A dress like that must have come all the way from Cincinnati. My sister brought it from Louisville. A present from my dear Papa. Good evening, Steve. - Ninian. Mary my dear, may I present our most eloquent citizen Mr Stephen Douglas. Mr Douglas, I am honored. - Miss Todd. Your brother-in-law has just now described me as eloquent. But alas I must now prove him wrong. Standing as I am in the presence of a penetrating intelligence. Such devastating charm, I am rendered speechless. I can hardly believe it. Ninian, I thought you were going to have that thing raised up. It wouldn't make a difference if he had. He'd have knocked over something else. Mr Lincoln is more at home in the backwoods than in the drawing room. How do you do, Mr Lincoln. Well so far, I haven't been doing so well, thank you. Never mind, Mr Lincoln. I'm sure the other gentlemen envy you being tall enough to hit the chandelier. Miss Todd, I want you to know that I resent that bitterly. Hello Abe. - Evening, Steve. Still got the same old coat, Abe? Got kind of attached to it. - Seems a little short. It will be longer before I get another. Abe is what you might call a self-made man. Well, I guess my parents ought to take some of the blame. When I first knew him he was behind the counter selling whiskey and rum. And intoxicating the customers with his own raw humor. You see Miss Todd, I was always behind the bar and .. Steve Douglas was always in front of it. Something tells me I shouldn't have started this. So I said to Daniel Webster. You may stand where you like in Massachusetts. But you'll meet your downfall out here in Illinois. I can understand why they speak of you as the little giant. Better be careful, Stephen. Mary is just as ambitious as you are. My sister has made no secret of the fact .. That the man she marries will be President of The United States. Well I'm delighted to hear it, Miss Todd. I've been looking for the perfect first lady as my consort in the White House. And now I've found her. Really? But you should give that out to the newspapers. "Stephen A. Douglas consents to become President." I .. Seem to need a little more refreshment. You are very sweet. Well, one night there was a gathering of all the grandees. You know, one of these high-toned shindigs. All the girls in town were there and the handsome widows .. And married women finicking about trying to look like girls. They were all tied together in the middle and popped out both ends. Like bundles of fodder waiting to be stacked. And wanting stacking pretty bad. And I'm hauling .. Well it started out to be a political story. And quite amusing too. Don't you think, gentlemen. But I think it is my turn to monopolise you for a while. Has Mary taken leave of her senses? Devoting herself to that Mr Lincoln. When we have most eligible gentlemen here to meet her. Perhaps Abe amuses her, my dear. My sister is a well-bred young lady. No. No, Mr Lincoln. I'm not laughing at you. I'm sure your mother must have been a wonderful woman. How old were you when she died? I was seven. The milk-sick got her. Poor creature. I helped Pa make the coffin. Whittled the pegs with my own jack-knife. We buried her in a timber clearing beside my grandmother. I used to go there often to look at the place. I used to watch the deer running over her grave with their little feet. I never could kill a deer after that. Once I .. Got a licking from Pa because when he aimed at a deer I knocked his gun up. This is no way to behave in society. Taking about the backwoods I come from. It is just the way to behave, Mr Lincoln. Please tell me some more about the lickings you got. [ Singing: ] "What has caused this great commotion? Motion, motion." "Our country through .." Notice the name, Billy? Here. Right down at the bottom. Boasting, huh? Bowling! How are you, Bowling? - Sorry we're late, but glad to see you. Glad to see you. This is Billy Hernden. Squire Green from New Salem. Proud to know you, sir. Mr Lincoln speaks of you constantly. Thank you, Mr Hernden. Are you a lawyer too? - I hope to be, sir. I am serving here as clerk in Judge Stuart's absence. So now you're teaching others, Abe? - No, just setting a bad example. How is that blessed wife of yours? - Nancy is as busy as ever. An more than ever concerned about your innermost hopes and yearnings. You can tell her I'm becoming a person of importance. Yes sir. If old Tippecanoe wins next fall .. I'll be a member of the electoral college. Is that the best you can do? You and Billy should get better acquainted. He's pretty disgusted with me too. Says I've no ambition. I associate with the wrong kind of people. He can't stand a man who keeps his mouth shut and abides by the constitution. If he had his way the whole Union would be set on fire. And we'd all be burnt to a crisp. Eh, Billy? Yes, Mr Lincoln. If you'll permit me to say so. I think you'd be more use to your fellow men .. If you allowed some of the same incendiary impulses to come out in you. You hear that, Bowling? I'm surprised at you, Abe. I thought you were opposed to slavery. I am opposed to slavery. But I'm even more opposed to getting myself into trouble. Why don't you run for Congress, Abe? - If I did I might get elected. I'd be in Washington. Then I might have to cast my vote on the terrible issues of war or peace. And what attitude would I take? The "liberal" attitude of course. And what is the "liberal" attitude? To go to war for a tract of land or a moral principle .. Or to avoid war at all costs. No sir, Bowling. I'm no fighting man. I found that out when I went through the Blackhawk war. And was terrified I might to have fire a shot at an Indian. Fortunately the Indians felt the same way, so I never saw any of them. Excuse me, Bowling. That's his trouble. Women. Well I should say that's the .. liberal attitude. I cannot and will not stand it any longer. All this ridiculous gossip must be silenced. Well after all, the gossip does none of us any harm, my dear. I ask you to keep out of this, Ninian. This is between my sister and myself. Nevertheless, Ninian is right. I ask you to deny once and for all that you've ever given one moment's thought. To the idea of marriage with Abraham Lincoln. Oh but I have. I've given many months thought to it. And I've decided that I shall be "Mrs Lincoln." Mary! Does it shock you so deeply, Elisabeth? And why not? Marrying him would mean life in a log cabin. With no servants, no decent clothes. You expect me to do precisely what you've done. Marry a rich well-bred gentleman like Ninian. Live in a fine house like this. A house with a fence around it to keep out the common herd. And also to prevent you from escaping from your own narrow life. Well, with all due respect to my dear brother-in-law. I don't want that and I won't have it. Never. In Abraham Lincoln I see a man who would split rails for other men's fences. But who will never build one around himself. You talk with a kind of irresponsibility that's not far from sheer madness. You've never made a move to change your condition or to improve it. You consider that it couldn't be improved. To you all this represents perfection. Well it doesn't to me. I want a chance to shape a new life for myself and for my husband. Is that irresponsibility? How far will you go with a man like that? Lazy and shiftless. Forever stopping along the way to tell jokes. He will not stop if I am strong enough to make him go on. And I am strong. I'll admit he seems to have no conception of his own power. Or if he has, he's afraid to face it. I'm not afraid. I'm ready to fight to make him fulfil his destiny. Even if you and all your world despise me for it. Ah, merely a small point Mary, but .. I suppose you've communicated your decision to Abe? Not yet. But when he comes this evening and he should be here at any moment. He will ask for my hand in marriage. After I've displayed the appropriate amount of .. Surprise and confusion. I shall murmur timidly: Yes. Oh, this is positively humiliating. Mr Lincoln, ma'am. Tell Mr Lincoln that .. I shall see him. Show him in. Will you step in, Mr Lincoln. Thank you, ma'am. Good evening, Mrs Edwards. Evening, Miss Todd. Ninian, good evening. Good evening. - Good evening. Glad to see you, Abe. And now if you'll excuse us. Elisabeth and I must hear the children's prayers and see them safely abed. I'd like to hear their prayers, too. Oh no. You'd only keep them awake with your stories. Come along, Elisabeth. - Well, kiss them goodnight for me. Mary. Won't you come with us to say goodnight? No, no my dear. Leave Mary here to keep Abe entertained. I don't blame Ninian for keeping you away from those children. They certainly adore you. You understand them. That is the important thing. But do sit down, Mr Lincoln. Here. By me. Thank you. I will. Happy new year, gentlemen! Happy new year! She's exactly like that, Billy. Whatever Abe lacks, she'll make up for. She has drive and perseverance. She'll make him fulfil his destiny. I'm glad to hear that, Mr Edwards. Here is to your health, sir. - To yours. Happy new year. How are you, Steve? Happy new year. Happy new year and give me a drink quickly, my host. That is spiced rum-punch or eggnog, Mr Douglas? I'll have a glass of some of each and then I'll make up my mind. Well Ninian, where is the lucky bridegroom? Abe? He wouldn't come here. Seems to be in one of his gloomy moods. Ah, just nervousness I expect. - Everything is ready for the ceremony. Elisabeth prepared a bang-up supper and the whole affair will go off handsomely. You will be there of course? - Ah yes. I am good sportsman. I'll swallow my mortification. And that's not all I'll swallow. To begin with. I ask you to join me in a toast gentlemen. To the fairest flower of all Kentucky. Miss Mary Todd. Who from this day on. Will be Mrs Abraham Lincoln. To Mary Todd! Happy new year, Mr Lincoln. Mr Speed. Happy new year to you, Billy. I've just been over to the Chenery House. They are all drinking toasts to your happiness. I wish to have a private toast of my own. Mr Lincoln .. when first I heard of your approaching marriage .. I confess I was afraid you were lowering yourself. Trading your honor for exalted family connection. I apologise for so thinking. I now believe that Miss Todd's ambitions for you are the same as my own. I believe that she will never stop driving and goading you .. Until you have reached the heights where you belong. I say God bless her and give her strength. And I drink to her. And to her husband, the future President of The United States. Put that away. Billy, I have a letter I wish you to deliver. A letter? To whom? You do it, Jack. You had no right to do that! - Maybe not. But it's done. And don't look at me as though you were planning to break my neck. I knew you could do it, Abe. But you won't. Mr Lincoln asked me to deliver a letter to Miss Todd, but I refused to do so. He was writing her to ask for his release .. From a marriage which would only lead to endless pain and misery for them both. If that isn't the truth, what is? And if that is the truth, tell her so to her face. In the manner of a man. I'd have to tell her that I have hatred for her infernal ambition. That I don't want to be ridden and driven onward and upward through life .. With her whip lashing me and her spurs digging in to me. If her poor small soul craves importance in life, let her marry Stephen Douglas. He's ambitious, too. I want only to be left alone. It would be more gracious to admit that you are afraid of her. Good for you, Mr Speed. - You'd better keep out of this. No, I won't. You are not abandoning Miss Mary Todd. No, you are only using her as the living sacrifice. Offering her up hoping you're forgiven for your failure to do your own duty. What "great duty"? Everyone feels called upon to remind me of it and no-one can tell me what it is. I can tell you. I can tell you what is the duty of every man who calls himself an American. It is to perpetuate those truths that were once held to be self-evident. That all men are created equal .. And endowed with the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Are those rights denied to me? Could you ever enjoy them while you realise .. That two million of your fellow beings in this country are slaves? When you look at that flag don't you ever realise .. That ten of its stars represent States that would destroy the Union .. Rather than give up their property rights on those slaves? Don't dare tell me that anybody in this world knows it more than you Mr Lincoln. You, who honor the memory of Elijah Lovejoy. And every other man who ever died fighting in the defence of freedom. I honor them. And envy them. Because they could believe that their ideals are worth dying for. Alright, Josh. I'll go up now and I'll take to Mary. Then I'm going away. Where, Abe? I don't know. [ Abe's mother: ] "The world passeth." "But he that doeth the will of God, abideth forever." Howdy, Abe. Hello, Abe. Well, well, Mr Lincoln. Glad to see you back. Thank you. Why Abe, when did you get back? How do you do. - Good afternoon. After his shameful treatment of Miss Todd .. I wouldn't think he'd dare show his face in this town. And going in the Edwards' home of all things. Right in where he's least wanted. Well, we can't say he lacks courage. Please come right in, Mr Lincoln. Glad to see you again, Abe. - Thank you, Mary. You may well wonder why I thrust myself on your mercy in this matter. I'm sure you're always welcome in Ninian's house. After my behaviour at our last meeting I haven't been welcome company for myself. Joshua Speed has kept us informed of your whereabouts. We've been greatly concerned. - You've been most kind. Now you return to your work and no doubt you will run for the assembly again. Or .. Perhaps you have larger plans? - I have no plans. I only wish to gain your forgiveness. There is no question of that. What happened between us was my own fault. I was blinded by my own self-confidence. I .. I loved you. I believed that I could make you love me. I believed that the fire of my ambition would burn in you. You would become a man. A leader of men. But. You didn't wish that. It is true Mary you once had faith in me which I was far from deserving. The time has come when I wish to strive to deserve it. I believe now that our destinies are together. For better or for worse. So I again presume to ask you to be my wife. I fully realize that taking me back involves humiliation for you. I've had humiliation already and survived it. But I promise you, Mary. If you will have me .. I shall devote myself for the rest of my days to trying to do what is right. As God gives me power to see what is right. Then. I shall be your wife. I shall fight by your side until death do us part. Abe .. I love you. Oh, I love you. Whatever becomes of the two of us, I'll die loving you. Slaves. Whether emancipated or not. They yet remain subject to the authority of the dominant race. And have no rights or privileges .. But such as those who hold the power of government .. Might choose to grant them. Are you John Brown? I am, sir. So what if I am John Brown? Don't try and fight them anymore. I place you under arrest for treason. For bearing arms against the government of The United States. I'd like to ask who is making this arrest. I am Lieutenant-Colonel Robert E. Lee of the 2nd Cavalry. Acting under orders from President Buchanan. It?s no use, Pa. You've got to give in to 'em. Somebody else .. Got to finish this job. Very well, Colonel Lee. I submit to arrest. Knowing full well I shall be hanged for this attempt to end the evil of slavery. But after I am dead the evil will remain. And you and all other patriots will come to learn .. It can be purged from this guilty world .. Only with blood. Goodbye, my son. Another fanatic has gone to meet his maker. Why can't these anti-slavery fools mind their own business. Senator Douglas! The message you've been waiting for. A telegram from Springfield. They've nominated Abraham Lincoln to run against the senator this fall. My heartiest congratulations. Lincoln? Who's he? What are they doing? Giving you the election? So Abe Lincoln has decided at last to come out and fight. The best thing that could happen to us. How does this Lincoln stand on slavery? Nobody knows. Least of all, Lincoln himself. He's the most undecided, hesitating-est critter you ever saw. We don't want that slave issue brought up in Illinois this year. You can count on old Abe. He's just what we want. A peaceful man. We'll start the campaign at once. I will return to Springfield. I want an unprecedented welcome when I get there. A brass band at the station. A big parade. And free liquor for all. You don't mean to say that you're afraid of Abe Lincoln? Why, the country doesn't know him. Maybe the country doesn't. But I do. All ready now. Keep very still. One. Two. Three. Tad, you are to keep absolutely still. You too, Willy. We will, Ma. Now please, one and all. One. Two. Three. Tad! If I have to speak to you once more .. But Pa keeps tickling me. I might have known it. Please, Mr Lincoln. Please bear in mind this picture was ordered by the Chicago Tribune. To spread far and wide during your campaign. I'm sorry, Mary. But I can't help thinking how foolish I look. Now I beg of you, no movement of any kind. This time we'll get it. One. Willy .. Tad. Come back here. Look, Pa. It's a great big parade. Douglas has arrived. Listen to them cheering for him. They ought to cheer him. He paid them enough for it. Old Abe won't have an answer for that one. You're a liar. We have now heard the leading argument. For the 2 candidates for the high office of United States Senator from Illinois. Judge Stephen A. Douglas. And Mr Abraham Lincoln. According to the usual custom of debate. Each of the candidates will now speak in rebuttal. Judge Douglas. My fellow citizens. My good friend Mr Lincoln has addressed you with his usual artless sincerity. His pure, homely charm. Hi perennial native humor. He has devoted a generously large portion of his address. To most amiable remarks .. Upon my fine qualities as a man. If not as a statesman. For which I express the deepest gratitude. But at the same time. I most earnestly beg you. Not to be deceived by his seeming innocence. His carefully cultivated spirit of goodwill. For in each of his little homilies. Lurk concealed weapons. Like Brutus. In Shakespeare's immortal tragedy. Mr Lincoln is an honorable man. But also, like Brutus .. He is an adept at the art .. Of inserting daggers between an opponent's ribs. Just when said opponent least expects it. Behold me, ladies and gentlemen. I am covered with scars. How dare they laugh. It's only a speech, mother. Any time you say, Abe. Mr Lincoln makes you laugh with his pungent anecdotes. He draws tears from your eyes. With his dramatic pictures of the plight of the black slave laborer in the South. Always, he guides you skilfully to the threshold of truth. But then, as you are about to cross it. He diverts your attention elsewhere. He never .. by any mischance. Makes reference to the condition of labor here in the North. Perhaps he's ignorant of the fact. That tens of thousands of workers are now on strike. Hungry men. Marching through the streets in ragged order. Promoting riots. Because they are not paid enough to keep the flesh .. Upon the bones of their babies. What kind of liberty is this? And what kind of equality? Right! Mr Lincoln harps constantly on this subject of "equality". He repeats over and over the argument used by Lovejoy and other abolitionists. To whit. That the Declaration of Independence. Having declared all men free and equal by divine law. Thus Negro equality is an inalienable right. Contrary to this is the verdict of the Supreme Court in the case of Dred Scott. Mr Lincoln is a lawyer. And I presume therefore that he knows. That when he seeks to destroy pubic confidence. In the integrity, the inviolability of The Supreme Court. He is preaching revolution. He asks me to state my opinion of the Dred Scott decision. And I answer him unequivocally. By saying I take the decisions of The Supreme Court. To be the law of the land. And I intend to obey them as such. Nor will I be swayed from that position. By all the ranting of all the fanatics. Who preach racial equality. Who would ask us to vote, eat, sleep and marry with Negroes. And I say further. Let each State mind its own business. And leave its neighbors alone. If we'll stand on that principle. Then Mr Lincoln will find. That this great republic can exist. Forever divided into free and slave States. And we can go on as we have done. Increasing in wealth. In population, in power. Until we shall become the admiration .. And the terror of the world. Listen to them yell, the empty- headed idiots. Yelling at empty words. He doesn't know what he's talking about. He never did. You're upsetting your drink. Mr Abraham Lincoln. Go get him, Abe! Judge Douglas has paid tribute to my skill with the a dagger. I thank him for that. But I must admit that he can do more with that weapon than I can. He can keep ten daggers flashing in the air at the same time. Fortunately, he's so good at it, none of the knives ever falls and hurts anyone. Now you heard the judge make allusion to those .. Who advocate voting and eating and marrying and sleeping with Negroes. Whether he meant me specifically, I do not know. If he did, I can only say this. Just because I do not want a colored woman for a slave .. I do not necessarily want her for a wife. I do not need to have her for either. I can just leave her alone. In some respects, she is certainly not my equal .. Any more than I am the judge's equal in .. Some respects. But in her natural right to eat the bread she earns with her own hands .. Without asking leave of somebody else she is my equal and equal of all others. Now you heard the judge speak about our own labor conditions. As an American I cannot be proud that such conditions exist. But as an American, I can ask. Would any of the striking workers in the North .. Elect to change places with the slaves in the South? Will they rather not say: The remedy is in our hands. And still as an American. I can say thank God we live in a system by which men have the right to strike. I am not preaching rebellion. I don't have to. This country with its institutions belongs to the people who inhabit it. Whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government. They can exercise their constitutional right of amending it. Or their revolutionary right to dismember or overthrow it. If the founding fathers gave us anything. They gave us that. The purpose of the Dred Scott decision is to make property .. And nothing but property of the Negro in all States of the Union. It is the old issue of human rights versus property rights. It is the eternal struggle between two principles. The one, the common right of humanity. The other, the divine right of Kings. It's the same spirit which says you toil and work and earn bread and I'll eat it. As a nation. We began by declaring all men are created equal. There's no mention of exceptions to that rule in the Declaration of Independence. But we now practically read it: "All men are created equal except Negroes." If we are to accept this doctrine of race or class discrimination. What is to stop us in future from decreeing .. All men are created equal except Negroes .. Foreigners. Catholics. Jews. Or just poor people. That is the conclusion towards which the advocates of slavery are driving us. "Let each State mind its own business" says Judge Douglas. "Why stir up trouble?" This is the complacent policy of indifference to evil. And that policy .. I cannot but hate. I hate it because of the monstrous injustice of slavery itself. I hate it because it denies our republic its just influence in the world. Enables the enemies of free institutions everywhere to taunt us as hypocrites. Causes the real friends of freedom .. To doubt our sincerity. And especially. Because it forces so many good men among ourselves. Into an open war with the very fundamentals of civil liberties. Denying the good faith of the Declaration of Independence. And insisting that there is no right principle of action. But self-interest. In his final words tonight. The judge said. That we can be: "The terror of the world". I don't think we want to be that. I think we would prefer to be the encouragement of the world. The proof that at last man is worthy to be free. But we shall provide no such encouragement .. Unless we can establish our ability as a nation to live and grow. And we shall surely do neither. If these States fail to remain united. There can be no distinction in the definition of liberty. As between one section and another. One class and another. One race and another. A house divided against itself cannot stand. This government cannot endure permanently. Half slave. And half free. "This government cannot endure permanently." "Half slave and half free." Here is the proof of your editorial for tomorrow, Mr Greeley. Scrap it. I'm going to write another one. About a man named Lincoln. Lincoln? Never heard of him. You will. Gentlemen, I beg of you. One at a time. If Stuart is nominated he'll want to emancipate all of the slaves. That would be the end of the Union. I tell you that Douglas will carry the South and the West. We've got to be sure of New York or we lose. And the only man .. - Stuart will never get my vote. Gentlemen, if you can't contain your tempers we'll never agree. We'll never agree on any of the leading candidates. That's obvious. What we need in this race is a dark horse. Yes, but what's his name? - Lincoln. Maybe you don't know it but there is a big country out west of the Alleghenies. With a lot of new States named Oregon, Minnesota, California. Which you seem never to have heard of. Lincoln is popular out there. And if we handle him right we can make him popular back here in the East. Anyway, I ask you gentlemen to look him over. Do you know him, Crimmin? I heard him debate with Douglas. And I can tell you one thing. He is a vote-getter if I ever saw one. No, they got safely to Oregon. Didn't you ever fight the Indians, Pa? Well not exactly. I was almost in a battle but I got lost from my men. Were you scared? That my boy, brings up a point of argument. When I got back to the camp the Colonel asked me if I'd run away. I said, no sir. But if anybody had asked me where I was going .. And I'd said I was going for the doctor they'd figure someone was almighty sick. Robert, you've been smoking again. - Yes, mother. I've told you that I will not tolerate tobacco smoke in my sitting room .. Or indeed in any part of my house. Come, come, Mary. You mustn't be disrespectful to Harvard man. Smoke it in the woodshed, Bob. - Yes, father. You children run upstairs. Get ready for your supper. Oh, Ma. Do as your mother tells you, son. Hello, Mr Speed. - Hello Tad, hello Sam. Say, Abe. That delegation arrived in town an hour ago. They ought to be here any minute. What delegation? Oh, some prominent politicians and ministers, several bankers. That kind of people. What are they coming here for? I don't precisely know. I presume it is to see if I'm fit to be a candidate .. For President of The United States. I guess they want to see if we live in a log cabin and keep pigs under the bed. And you didn't tell me? I'm sorry, Mary. It slipped my mind. You are being considered for the Presidency but it slipped your mind? Oh, if I had only known. If you'd only given me time to prepare for them. Now they'll see us as we are. Crude, sloppy western barbarians living in a house reeking of foul tobacco smoke. And your filthy old carpet slippers. I declare, Abraham Lincoln .. You'd treat me with more consideration if I were a slave rather than your wife. Go this minute and put some decent boots on. Yes, Mary. I know, Joshua. You think. Just as all the others do. I'm a bitter nagging woman. That I've tried to kill his spirit and dragged him down to my level. No, Mary. I think nothing of the kind. Remember, I know Abe too. He's always had some obsession of some future doom. And for eighteen years I've been trying and trying to stir him out of it. But all my efforts have been like .. So many waves dashing against the rock of ages. And now the greatest opportunity comes to him. Here, right into his own house. He must take it. He must see that this is what he was meant to be. But I can't persuade him of it. I thought that I could help to shape him as I knew he should be. And I've succeeded in nothing but in breaking myself. Mr Lincoln. - I've got my boots on, Mary. You can receive them in here while I try to prepare some refreshments for them. [ Door knocks ] How do you, Mr Crimmin. Glad to see you again. Thank you, Mr Lincoln. - Step into the parlor, gentlemen. Come on in, Josh. Oh no. You got to face this out by yourself, Abe. Good luck. Is it true that they're expecting to make Abe President? How many times have I told you to speak of your master as "Mister Lincoln"? He ain't my master any more than he is yours. Besides, I've known Abe ever since he wore pants that were nought but patches. The kettle is boiling Mrs Lincoln. President of The United States? If they get him back into Washington he won't never come out alive. I hesitate to mention such a delicate matter, Mr Lincoln. Please don't hesitate, Dr Barrett. There has been some grave doubt about your religious beliefs. - I know. They always called me an atheist because I've refused to become a church member. And why have you refused? I have found their articles of belief too complicated for me. But I assure you Dr Barrett that I will gladly join at any time any church .. Whose sole qualification for membership .. Is obedience to the Saviour's own statement of law and gospel: "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart." "With all thy soul." "With all thy mind." "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thy self." Well now gentlemen, if you will excuse me. I believe Mrs Lincoln is preparing a slight collation. And I must see if I can be of any help. Well gentlemen, what's the verdict? The man unquestionably is an infidel. And a radical. He's as much of a demagogue as Douglas. He is an idealist in a curious, primitive way. He's a rabble-rouser pure and simple. In my opinion this man Lincoln is not safe. What do you mean: not safe? - Just that. He's a radical. A man who devotes himself so wholeheartedly .. To currying favor with the mob, develops a mob mentality. And what's more, he evaded our questions. Now please gentlemen, I may not know as much as you of economics and theology. But I do know politics. And what is the essential quality that we demand in our candidate? It is simply this. That he be able to get himself elected. Well, there's something in what you say. And do you think he can do it? I tell you gentlemen, in that uncouth rail-splitter .. You may observe one of the slickest, smoothest politicians .. That ever hoodwinked a yokel mob. Of course he evaded your questions. You ask him about the labor question and he said: "I believe in democracy" You asked him about religion and he replied: "Love thy neighbor as thyself." Now you know you couldn't argue with that. Any of you. The voters will love him because he's just as common as they are. A plain, homespun American. His very name is right. Honest old Abe. He'll play the game with us now .. And he'll go right on playing it after we get him into the White House. He will do just what we tell him. Look, Mr Crimmin. Now gentlemen, if you will step into the dining room .. Mrs Lincoln will be pleased to serve you with a cup of tea. Thank you. - Well, this is most gracious. Bring your cigar with you, Mr Crimmin. Thank you. Thank you. Does Mr Lincoln seem to be worrying any? - No. He's in there reading a newspaper. Lincoln and Douglas neck-and-neck in Illinois. Maryland is going all for Bell and Breckinridge. Abe, you're not doing fair in Maryland. I see the New York Herald says I got the soul of Uriah Heep .. Cased in the body of a baboon. What does it say about New York? Douglas 117,000. Lincoln 106,000. He's winning over you in New York, Abe. Not yet, Mary. These returns so far are coming mostly from the city .. Where Douglas is bound to run the strongest. What's it look like in Pennsylvania, Ninian? There's nothing to worry about there, Mary. It's safe for Abe. In fact there is no need to worry at all. Yes, you've said that over and over all evening. There is no need to worry. How can we help worrying when every new bulletin shows Douglas ahead? But every one of them shows Abe gaining. Let 'em count all the votes in New York. You'll be on the way to the White house. Why don't they hurry with it? When do those returns come in? They'll come in soon enough. Telegram from New York. Mr Belmont states Mr Douglas has filed a majority 50,000 votes in New York City. Ah, shut up! The mob down there is sickening. Cheering every bulletin that's splashed on the wall whether good news or bad. And they cheer every picture of every candidate including George Washington .. With the same fine ignorant enthusiasm. Maybe they can't tell the difference. The reporter are outside, Mr Lincoln. They want to know .. What will be your first official action after you are elected. What do you want us tell them, Abe? - Say I'm thinking of growing a beard. A what? Whatever put that idea in your head? I had a letter from a little girl saying whiskers would give me more dignity. And I'll need it if elected. "Missouri. Douglas 35,000." "Dell 33, Breckinridge 16." "Lincoln 8." Mr Lincoln, you're being them beaten badly in Rhode Island. What are they cheering for? - They don't know. The Chicago Times says: "Lincoln breaks down". "His heart fails him, his tongue fails him, his legs failed him." "He fails all over." "Douglas skins the living dog." Stop it! I can't stand it any longer. Yes my dear. I think you should go home. I'll join you presently. I won't go home. You only want to be rid of me. That's all you wanted, ever since the day we were married. And before that, anything to get me out of your sight because you hate me. And it's the same with all of you. All his friends. You hate me. You wish I'd never come into his life. - No, ma'am. Will you all please step out for a minute. Why do you use every opportunity you can to make a public fool me and yourself? It's bad enough when you act like that in the privacy of our own home. But here in front of people? You are not to do that again, do you hear. You are never to do that again. You've never spoke to me like that before. You've lost your temper, Abe. You've never done that before. I'm sorry. I still think you should go home .. Rather than stay here and endure the strain of this death-watch. This is the night I dreamed about when I was a child. When I was an excited young girl .. And all the gay young gentlemen in Springfield were courting me. And I fell in love with the least likely of them. This is the night I'm waiting to hear my husband has become .. President of The United States. And even if he does. It's ruined for me. It's too late. Is mother alright? - Yes, son. She gone home. You'd better go with her. - Yes, sir. It looks like 74 electoral votes. Sure for you. And 27 more probably. New York will give you the election. Mark my words, Mr Lincoln. This election is wrapped up tightly in a neat bundle .. Ready to deliver on your doorstep tonight. We fought the good fight and we won. We fought the good fight. The dirtiest campaign in the history of corrupt politics. And if I win. I must fulfil all the dishonest pledges made in my name. You gentlemen have all been friends of our candidate for a long time. So possibly you can answer a question that has been puzzling me considerably. Can I possibly be correct in supposing that he doesn't want to win? The answer is yes. Well, I can only say that for me this is all a refreshingly new experience. Would you want to become President of The United States at this time? Haven't you read the newspapers lately? Why yes. I try to follow the events of the day. Don't you realize that they've raised 10,000 volunteers in South Carolina? They are armed. The governor has issued a proclamation .. Saying that if Mr Lincoln is elected, the State will secede tomorrow. And every other State south of the Dixon line will go with it. Can you see what that means? War. Civil war. He'll have the whole terrible responsibility for it. The man who's never wanted anything in his life but to be let alone in peace. Calm down, Billy. Go get yourself another drink. Mr Edwards, here it is! "At 10:30 tonight the New York Herald conceded that Mr Lincoln .." "Had carried the State by a majority of 25,000 and had won the election!" Listen to 'em, Abe. Listen to that crazy howling mob down there. That's all for you, Mr Lincoln. Abe .. get out there and make them a speech. No, I don't want to go out there. I think I'll go home and tell Mary. This is Captain Kavanagh, Mr President. I've been detailed to accompany you, Mr Lincoln in the event you're elected. I am grateful to you, Captain. But I don't need you. You had better have us, sir. Sorry. I don't want to be alarming. I guess you know as well as I do that threats are made against your life. Goodnight, Josh. Ninian, Mr Crimmin. Billy. Thank you. One moment, sir. With your permission, I'll go first. Steve, it's good of you to come. Abe, you and I have been adversaries for a good many years. We've indulged in mortal combat on every conceivable issue. But now, you are President of The United States. And I want you to know that I'm fighting with you. Steve, you're a good generous man. Speech! Speech! Say something, Abe. - Speech! They want you to say something, Abe. My dear friends, I have to say goodbye to you now. Leaving for Washington with my new whiskers of which I hope you approve. No, no Lieutenant! Let them come on. They are all old friends of mine. No-one not in my situation .. Can appreciate my feelings of sadness at this parting. To this place and the kindness of you people, I owe everything. I now leave not knowing when or whether ever I may return. It is a grave duty that I must face. In preparing for it. I have tried to enquire. What great principle or ideal it is .. Which has kept this Union so long together. And I believe that it was not .. The mere matter of separation of the colonies from the motherland. But that sentiment in the Declaration of Independence. Which gave liberty to the people of this country. And hope to all the world. We gained democracy. And there is now doubt whether it is fit to survive. I've heard an Eastern monarch .. Who once charged his wise men to invent him a sentence .. Which should be true and appropriate at all times and situations. They presented him with the words: "And this too shall pass away." That's a comforting thought in times of affliction. And this too shall pass away. Yet. Let us believe that it is not true. Let us live to prove that we can cultivate the natural world around us. And the intellectual and moral world within us. So that we may secure an individual .. Social .. And political prosperity. Whose course shall be forward. And which while this earth endures .. Shall not pass away. I commend you to the care of the Almighty. And I hope in your prayers you may remember me. Friends, one and all. I must now bid you an affectionate farewell. [ Singing: ] "Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord." Bye, Abe. "He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored." "He hath loosed the fateful lightning of H?s terrible sw?ft sword." "His truth is marching on." "Glory, Glory, hallelujah!" "Glory, Glory, hallelujah!" "Glory, Glory, hallelujah!" "His truth is marching on." "Glory, Glory, hallelujah!" "His truth is marching on." T-G o?
