May I have your attention. Parents of new elementary students, please submit your documents at the assembly hall no later than 11 a.m. Move, everyone. Let me through. This way, son. Oh, my god. Come here. Isares Arunvilai is number one on the waiting list. He's got 97 out of 100. How much did the accepted students score? Between 98 to 100. -May I see their names? -No, you may not. Thank you. So he's giving up his seat? No. I'm going to speak to the director. To hold his seat, you have to register and pay the administration fee. But you said he's on the waiting list. Four students who scored 96.5 are also waiting. All right. How much? A total of 9,800 baht. Ohm. If we have 25,000 baht and we pay 600 for the registration fee, how much do we have left? It's 24,400 baht. And if we pay an extra 9,800 baht fee to hold a place on the waiting list, how much do we have left? We'll only have 14,600 baht. Also we need new uniforms, new shoes, and a new school bag. Mom. I can't believe you only got on the waiting list. Just one more point, why couldn't you do it for me? Try harder next time, okay? I will, Mom. Ohm, come with me. Just one game, then study hard. Don't let me down. 8 YEARS LATER FEBRUARY 8 OHM'S SCHOLARSHIP EXAM "Today, students spend an average of five hours a day in their classroom." "Statistics also show that they spend 4.1 hours a day looking at their phones." "The number is likely to go up." "They prefer looking at their phones to playing sports." "So I'd like to propose a project called 'School…'" No, scratch that. "Phone-Free Classroom." "We must now realize that mobile phones are a major threat." Hello? Ms. Ben? My son won't need your tutoring services this month. His friend took an online class and got good grades. So my son wants to give it a try. That's okay. Bye. TUTORING INCOME -4,000 BAHT ELECTRICITY BILL -3,000 BAHT INTERNET BILL -1,000 BAHT CREDIT CARD BILL -3,000 BAHT WATER BILL -400 BAHT Your friend SonicFighter is back again. Hello, everyone. Triple Kill, I got you! That's it, boy! Here it is, attack now! Nice one! Tank? Take this! Arum, go! Go now! Easy, I'll go round. Yorn with low mobility! It's over! Shit! Why didn't you open the door? Sorry, Mom. I'm writing a speech. What speech? My speech for Mother's Day. I was selected to read it on stage. What's with the earphones? Well, when I need to focus, I always listen to music. Well. New computer set? Yes, Mom. It was Palm's. I sold my old PC and used the money to buy this one from him. Don't worry. It's a cheap outdated model. And this? What is it? It's a letter asking for your permission to let me enter a game tournament. Where will you find time for that? You have to focus on your studies. I have some free time when I'm not studying. Look, I'm always on track, right? It's just an online game. Please sign it. Have I ever let you down? NEXT MORNING INVITATION TO JOIN MOTHER'S DAY ACTIVITIES PERMISSION TO PARTICIPATE IN ROV TOURNAMENT Director, we must realize that mobile phones are a major threat. The Wi-Fi here is very strong. That means if our school's Wi-Fi is this strong, mobile phones must be unequivocally banned in class. Sir, she's right. Schools in France have already implemented this rule. I will push it through. Our school should've been stricter in this regard a long time ago. I'll send the two of you to other schools to study how they restrict mobile phone usage. That way, you can adapt it to our classrooms. From now on, our Ratpanyavittayakom School will become a model of excellence! All right, the Burmese attacked us from three separate fronts. From the North, in the town of Chiang Saen. From the West, here. Through the Three Pagodas Pass. And from the South, at Ratchaburi. King… Hold on. Right. King Bodawpaya split his last troops into nine armies and marched them toward Bangkok. King Rama I sent his three armies to halt the Burmese. But in a war, numbers aren't everything. What you need is a strategy! Holy crap! Just like playing RoV! Class, what's the name of the Burmese general? Another great battle is here. We're entering a new war! The Army of Valor marching into the jungle battlefield. The troop is split into three fronts. The five heroes must work together and marshal their forces into the fray. Their mission is to reach the enemy's Core. They have to rely on a combination of skills and talents to fight their opponents in this breathless battle. But in war, there must be sacrifices. But that doesn't mean defeat. The only way to win is to destroy the towers! For the glory of… RoV. Come and get me! See? Who's the boss now? I just saved you. All of you! March your asses to the Discipline Office! -Yes, sir. -Yes, sir. STUDENTS ON DISCIPLINARY PROBATION ACADEMIC YEAR 2019 DISCIPLINE OFFICE Kobsak, I haven't tallied your latest offense. But this is already your ninth. One more time and you'll be kicked out. How many times have I told you to behave yourself? Why can't you be like other students? All you do is cause trouble and play stupid games. You will have no future! All you do is cause… You will have no future! All you do is cause… You will have no future! KOBSAK WONGVIJITSUK Kobsak! Where are you going? Haven't you listened to anything I've said? That's a game-addicted teen for you. Aggressive. MOTHER'S DAY PADUNGKIAT PATTANA SCHOOL ISARES ARUNVILAI STUDENT OF THE YEAR Did you watch Ohm's gamecast the other day? RoV? Yes, I did. He was on a roll when his mom suddenly walked in. He lied to her without skipping a beat. Son of the year. His channel is "SonicFighter," right? It was fucking hilarious. Totally. Yes, nice one! You rock, Champ. Super awesome. Shit! Mom. Why are you doing this? Did your game addiction make you lie to me? I never taught you to be a liar. From now on, I'll limit your phone use. -Mom. -Not another word. Quit playing and resign from Higher. Next, Isares Arunvilai, Student of the Year 2019, will represent the class by giving a speech. MOTHER'S DAY Isares, please come up on stage. Isares, please come up now. Ohm! Come down, Ohm. Ohm. Mom, is Ohm there with you? Nothing. Hi, my name's Best. I'm the one who called you. Ohm. Come home with me. You're not competing. He could go home. But if you want him to quit the team, you're obliged by contract to pay compensation. The equivalent of his 12 months' pay plus allowance. What allowances? Do you really think giving your kid 100 baht a day is enough? Ohm earns several thousand a month by himself. You really have no idea? The compensation will be 675,000 baht. Wait a minute. What for? Why do I have to pay for it? Because you signed the contract. I didn't sign any contract. To terminate the contract, you must pay for the damages. My team has a sponsor. You can't ruin my team and get away with it. What is this, Ohm? Come home with me now. Yes, go home and talk it over. But while Ohm is still under contract, he must come and train with the team. We will compete in the national league to represent Thailand in a world tournament in Korea. On February 8. I ask for your understanding. Don't ruin the hard work all of us have put in. FEBRUARY 8: OHM'S SCHOLARSHIP EXAM Ohm. How long have you been playing? It doesn't affect my grades, does it? Answer me, how long have you been playing? Why do you care more about money than about your future? How much can you make by playing games? More than you. I don't even have to rely on you for money now. See? Games make you aggressive. You can make your own money, huh? Student of the Year? You forged my signature. I did ask you to sign it. But you kept saying whatever you wanted to say. Really, have you ever listened to me? FEBRUARY 8: OHM'S SCHOLARSHIP EXAM I'LL TALK TO YOU ONLY AFTER THE TOURNAMENT Ohm, have your breakfast. Ohm. I'LL TALK TO YOU ONLY AFTER THE TOURNAMENT But if you want him to quit the team, you're obliged to pay 675,000 baht for the damages. I've got all the documents for the refinance of your home. Your property is in a prime location. You've had it for three years. The value must have risen. Don't worry. I'll speed up the process and get back to you. We will compete in the national league to represent Thailand in a world tournament in Korea. We will compete in the national league to represent Thailand in a world tournament in Korea. If they lose, then they won't get to go. OHM, WILL TAKE HIGHER EVEN HIGHER THAN BEFORE WON THE CHAMPIONSHIP FOR THE SECOND TIME KOBSAK, MAPRANG, GUIDE GOT KICKED OUT Kobsak. What's up, ma'am? You know Higher Ground Thailand, right? You were on this team before. Why do you ask? I'm starting an E-Sports club. Sorry, ma'am, what have you been smoking? This Higher… Are they really that good? Their new gen is not bad. But the original members were a whole lot better. Then start a team and beat them. I'll be your manager. -Ma'am. -Yes? Are you kidding me? I already struggle in school as it is. I don't have time for anything else. If you win the national tournament, I'll help you graduate. How about this? You know the RoV website, right? There's an application form for the tournament there. I'll send you all the members' IDs. But one more thing, I get to choose the players myself. But I have to know their backgrounds, okay? I heard you had a fight with one of your teammates. No! Ms. Ben, chill. I'm not a thug. Now we are with Gold Cobra. They are our new champions! How do you feel? What's up, Kob? Guide, do you want to join my team? Hell yes! "Hell yes!" That's how a champion feels! SO WHAT SHOULD WE CALL OUR TEAM? I'LL TALK TO YOU ONLY AFTER THE TOURNAMENT FEBRUARY 8: OHM'S SCHOLARSHIP EXAM First, I play the jungler. My position is vital to the team because it decides victory or defeat. Without me, the first-gen Higher wouldn't have made it. Even now, people still call me "The Living Legend." This is my buddy, Guide. He's so versatile that he can play any role. But when he's the marksman, prepare to beg for your life. Once, he was so off his game that Best kicked him out. But now I'm ready to announce that he's back in top form. This is Bank. A famous gamecaster with a million subscribers. His family is loaded. He's our team's sponsor. Not a pro player, but he's a brilliant mid laner. He can save your ass anywhere in the game. This is Maprang, the former girl idol of Higher. Although Best used to keep her as a bench-warmer, don't underestimate her baby-doll looks. She's quick and sharp. A perfect roaming hero who keeps an eye on what happens to cause trouble for the enemies and to support the team all at once. That's our team. Why only four? Meet Max. Get the fuck off. Get off, you dickhead. Sure, dickbag. This little shit is Max. He's my neighbor. He may not look like it, but he's actually around my age. Max plays the solo fighter. Crafty and fierce. The only shortcoming is his potty mouth. Motherfucker. I'll smack your head right here. Bitch. I'm Ms. Ben, your team manager. A sub. The rule doesn't require a team manager. Besides the main players, one sub is allowed, but he or she must meet a minimum skill level. A rookie like you won't cut it. Just give me your ID, I'll handle the rest. The Core must be destroyed in three minutes! Hi guys, Winsy Mavin's here to welcome you to Road to Arena of Valor 2019. The match I'm doing a commentary on is between Ohmgaga and Beta Blue. Our main talking point is that Ohmgaga has three players who used to play for Higher. They are Maprang, Kobsak, and Guide, a veteran marksman who's making a comeback. Let's see if this match will really be settled in three minutes. I'm looking forward to an exciting game ahead! Breach their defense with Five Sisters Matrix. This complex maneuver by Ohmgaga relies on a tight interplay between Kobsak and Guide. They've unleashed non-stop kills from the first five seconds. -Awesome! -Awesome! Sweet dreams. What now, daddy? Next, we'll go for Tier-1 Tower. Let's do Looking for Trouble, okay? -Who will do it? -Not me, I'm pretty. I'm ready to sacrifice for the public good. For freedom. I'll return happiness to the people! -Fuck-a-doodle-doo! -Fuck-a-doodle-doo! "Looking for Trouble" is a plan in which Bank sacrifices himself as bait to clear the path for his friends to destroy the first tower. How generous! Without sacrifices, there will be no victory. No pain, no gain, right? Tier-2 Tower, Girls Just Want to Have Fun. This plan relies on a gang of "girls." Kobsak plays the seducer. His role is to lure the enemies in so the other "girls" waiting in the back, Maprang, Guide, and Max, can sneak an attack on them. Amazing! Smooth and swift! That's it! Let's end this! Or they'll hit our towers. When they're born, we'll kill them. What a savage little guy! -Always going for a kill. -Yes! -Come on! Let's kill them all! -Come on. Three minutes are almost over. Ohmgaga is raiding the Core with a huge advantage. They're also ruthless and sadistic! They're waiting to kill newborns in the tower! Man, what a bunch of cutthroats! -That's it! -Let's do it! Beta Blue's Core has been destroyed! It has now been reduced to ruins! Ohmgaga is through to the next round. I've never witnessed a game as exciting as this in my life! See, my plan always works. Awesome! Are you that hungry? Seriously? Look at him. Hungry online and offline. ORIGINAL MEMBERS RISE AGAIN AS OHMGAGA FOUR STRAIGHT WINS AMONG THE LAST 128 TEAMS OHMGAGA DECLARES WAR ON HIGHER You guys were phenomenal in the last four matches, what's your secret? I've studied the game's meta thoroughly. The secret is to pick the right heroes. Let me tell you, Ohmgaga is ready to take on anyone. PHONE-FREE CLASSROOM PROJECT A one-on-one match with Higher is coming up. Do you have any message for your rival? Go to hell, assholes. Do you want to fight one-on-one with me? What was that? With Kob and I on the team, we'll never lose. -Listen, Maprang. -Yes? Thanks for joining my team. I did it because you sounded desperate. If we win and go to Korea, will you still go to study in England? Let's wait until we get into the round of last 16 teams first. -I have something to show you. -What? My dad just gave it to me. Congratulations! Now you're a biker like you always wanted. I'm still missing a biker babe… Stop. Why? Thanks for the ride. ROUND OF 128 TEAMS Ms. Ben, are you free? What happened? Shit happens! Guide has dumped us! -How come? -Higher has bought him back. Because we can't pay him a salary. Goddamnit, he quit just before a match! Call him now! He won't come back. You're our sub. You have to play. I can't. You have to. Game starts in 15 minutes! MAP INFO: STANDARD MODE Ms. Ben, you have to play the marksman. Choose a marksman character, any of them. And please don't die! The marksman is squishy. Now tell me what to do. Dumbass. You're Yorn. Go to Dragon Lane. Who's the teacher here, stupid? Watch your language, kid! Don't follow me. Go to Maprang. Go! Get behind the tower. Hide! Just hit the right button. Don't let anyone get near the tower. Who's in there? I need to pee. Are you on drugs or what? She's playing like a frigging kid. Who's in there? I need to shit. Don't just stand there. Move around. Please check if there's anyone missing. We've been knocking but there's no answer. Maybe there's been an accident. Ms. Ben… MS. TOOM IS CALLING No answer. Can we just win it now? What's the hurry? Do you need to shit or what? Please stop at a gas station. It's an emergency. Yes, we won! We won! Without Guide, we should just quit. We won't be this lucky in the next match. I'm out. Come on. Relax. We've made it this far. We're going to be in deep shit. You guys just have to quit, but my reputation will be ruined. We played like rookies, it was embarrassing. Ms. Ben, do you really think you can fill in for Guide? Bank. She's a rookie. Don't pressure her. Sorry, ma'am. I have to speak honestly. You must try not to be a deadweight. What do you want me to do? From now until the finals, you have to play the game at least 1,000 times. Impossible, I won't have time for that. Just play 30 times a day. We'll play with you. What about the one-on-one challenge with Higher? There's nothing to fear when I'm right here! Listen up! Starting tomorrow, we all sleep here so we can teach the teacher. People keep asking me what the best strategy for a marksman is. The first thing you have to remember is who plays the tank on your team. Who is Tank? Is it a water tank? Or maybe "tank you"? No. Tank is the hero with the highest HP. The toughest, strongest guy who can protect you, because your body is squishy. Without cover you're dead. So you have to follow the tank of your team. YOU SHOULD EAT HEALTHY FOOD, OHM. You have to keep in mind who your Tank is. Or you're finished. Don't go at it alone, because you're squishy. Again, the marksman always follows the tank. Never let him out of your sight. What are you doing? First, you have to develop your skill Because the enemy will go for a kill If you're too thick to know the drill And so clumsy You'll be trapped and killed Boom! Pack it up and roll down the hill See, you don't know how to kite. You have to move when you're under attack. The marksman must support the tank. Follow him and watch his steps. Got it? Take him. Take him. Omen, a crafty warrior. Omen's first skill is hooking the enemies. The second skill is deflecting the damage. The third skill is imprisoning enemies, with a 40-second cooldown. Valhein is a marksman. Got it? You even know how to hit it? You keep missing! Having fun? HI, MS. BEN. YOUR LOAN IS APPROVED. PLEASE COME IN AND SIGN THE AGREEMENT WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. CAN I HAVE A LITTLE MORE TIME TO THINK ABOUT THIS? Now you attack. I'll show you how to kite. Okay. No! That's not it! That's fencing! It's not kiting! Take that! This is kiting! Kob! Take it easy. Does it hurt? Careful. -You're all bruised up. -Not so hard. Yes. -Kob should've held back. -That's right. I told him so. Ms. Ben, I told you, no pain, no game. Brush your teeth, Max. Hey, you. When was the last time you brushed? Fuck off. Do you want to fight me? Sure. Can you reach my face? -What? -Oh, my! Four in the mid lane! Attack Dark Slayer! All of you, come here! I'm dead! Ohm! I'm coming. I'm dead. We can still get it! I'm dead too, Ohm. Their jungler is dead. I'm dead too. Ohm, get Dark Slayer! I'm dead. Ohm, why didn't you come help us? I can end this myself. -Why didn't you come when we called? -I will show you. -You're the only one left! -Ohm, what are you doing? Don't fucking say "yes." Do you think you're the star player? If Violet wasn't so lame, you would've been crushed. Why did you hide in the bush? Why didn't you come out and help them get Dark Slayer? Had you come out sooner, no one would've gotten killed. Got it? We could've won more clinically. You think you're a hotshot? But… But what? I just won. But you did not win like a Higher member is supposed to. Since Guide left, we've played like shit. We're a joke. Our subscribers have left in droves. Maprang, you have to help us now. Do I have to do it? Come on, just like when you were with Higher. You did this before. Hi, today… Best forced me to do it then. Please, I'm begging you. Doll yourself up like you're in a girl group. It will boost our team's rating. Hi, today is a holiday… No way. Don't you think I look more like a boy? I'm sure you can do it. We have no other options. I'm desperate. Please help me. Or should I ask her instead? Need my help? -No way. -No way. -Go. -Go! Maprang, come play with us. -Nice and smooth. -Nice and smooth. Maprang. One down! Did you do your makeup without a mirror? Wow, cute. Thanks. So cute… because you put duct tape on your brows! Good one, man! I'm proud of you. Our ratings will go through the roof. I mean it. You're cute. Cute, my ass. Best, I think I'm a better player when I play in my own style. Only a good plan can make you win. Your relentless attacking has made you famous, but it's not enough to ensure our victory in a one-on-one with Kobsak. What will happen if we're over-confident and don't follow the plan? Ask Guide about it. If you indulge yourself too much, you'll end up like this team. This is an example of a dreadful, ad-lib play. This is Ohmgaga. What a shame they have our old members among them. Kobsak may be sharp, but he can't carry the whole team on his shoulders. This is Max, a clusterfuck in the making. The player True_Heroes still has a lot to learn. Maprang keeps running around fixing others' problems. But seriously, she's not useful to anybody except Kob. This is how you play with zero planning. Can you see how disorganized they are? They failed as a team. Their marksman is a disaster. Hey, Guide. And who's this BenJay? A teacher at Kob's school. Her real name's Benjamas. Hello and welcome to Garena Special Match 1-1. Kobsak from Ohmgaga up against Ohm from Higher. Both of them have to play Raz in this head-to-head battle. Will the upstart outsmart the pro? See you in the game! And who's this BenJay? A teacher at Kob's school. Her real name's Benjamas. Mom, you're playing for Ohmgaga? And the winner is Ohm from Higher! Ohm's plan was to let Kobsak come straight at him… Mom, when I grow up, I will take you to a mountain where there's lots of snow. What will we do on the snowy mountain? We'll go skiing. I'LL TALK TO YOU ONLY AFTER THE TOURNAMENT Kob, I want to talk to you about your grades. Do we have to discuss this now? Wait, it won't take more than a minute. -No more than a minute? -Yes. -One minute, right? -Yes. Fine. Is that really necessary? Yes, I'm timing it. Go! You got a C in social studies and a C+ in Thai language. D in math, D in science, and D in Buddhism. D+ in Thai music, D+ in computer studies, D in English, B in health education, A in PE. Bottom line is, you won't graduate high school. You have to do better in subjects with high credits. At least a C. For subjects with lower credits, try to get an A, like health education or PE which is your favorite. Put them all together, your GPA will go up around 0.3 to 0.5 points, which means you'll pass. But for math, I want you to get at least a C. With free electives, you can fail as many as you like, and you'll still graduate! Just 36 seconds. Badass! I have an idea. You will study hard? No, I have a better idea. Ready? Nakroth, 24 seconds. Tel'Annas, 35 seconds. Maloch, 40 seconds. Raz, 20 seconds. Nakroth Ult. Maloch Ult. Tel Ult. Raz Ult. Nakroth, 10. Raz, 15. Tel, 27. Maloch, 29. -Badass! -Badass! Not bad? ROUND OF 64 TEAMS Fight! We'll get to the offline round soon. -Of course. -Of course. All in the mid lane, go invade Red. Tel is alone, attack it. No, I don't want to ruin my nails. -Awesome! -Awesome! Maprang, cover Ms. Ben. Relax. Stay in the tower for now, Ms. Ben. Fourteen. Thirteen. And this one? Ten seconds left. Go for it. Kob, that one's got Ultimate, careful. Got you! Max, now! Got it. Take that! Nice! Their timing is perfect. Like they can read our minds. The screen doesn't show a counter, right? So how do they know how long until we can use our ultimate skills? -Kob, you've got five seconds. -Now! Maprang, you've got seven seconds. They will use Ultimate soon, go now! We're almost there. Yes! Yes! You're awesome. So precise like clockwork! You know the exact moments to attack or retreat. Sure. I trained her myself. If there's anything you want, just let me know. In that case, can I ask you something? Sure, go ahead. Now that our ratings have gone up, can Maprang stop wearing this cutie-kitten outfit? Please. If that's what you want, of course! Thank you. Just be yourself. All right. -Hey! -Wait! Don't just take your t-shirt off. Take everything off! You guys! Hey, Max! In your dreams! Let's eat. Actually, I like it all. How it was before or how it is now. This pork, I like it however it's cooked. Thought you were talking about me. I was talking about you. This one's for you. Couple of the year. How come I never knew? Why should I tell you? Peek-a-boo! Attention, today we will launch a new program. "Phone-Free Classroom" starts now. We request all students to leave your phone here and retrieve it during lunch break. Leave your phone here and retrieve it during lunch break. Stop! Leave your phone here and retrieve it during lunch break. Leave your phone here and retrieve it during lunch break. Leave your phone… Cellphones are great, but we often ignore their negative effects. Statistics show that 75 percent of Thai youths use mobile phones without limits. A total of 42.2 percent use their phones only to play games. That's why they suffer from a short attention span. Research shows that 85 percent perform poorly in English and mathematics. Thai students spend an average of five hours a day in class. But they spend 4.1 hours a day on their phones. And the numbers are going up. They don't play sports, all they do is look at their phones. So I'd like to propose the "Phone-Free Classroom" program. We must come to the conclusion… that mobile phones are a clear and present threat! Error Identification Exam guidelines… ROUND OF 32 TEAMS "Environ…" what? What "environment"? This is too hard for me. Get lost. I don't want to. Kob! What? I'll smack your head. Go on. But let me touch your brows. This is fun! Stop smiling. Sneaky punk. Sir, I was using it to review a lesson. Not for chatting or playing games. Ms. Ben sent me the review materials. Look. Stop lying, Kobsak. Ms. Benjamas will never allow her students to use their phones. What do you know? She runs the school's E-Sports team. She's not a dinosaur like you. Look, Kobsak. I'll never buy your lame excuse. You know why? Because the Phone-Free Classroom is Ms. Benjamas' project. Not so fast. Come and get it after school. I can't reach Kob. What do we do? I knew this team would never work! No, don't say that. You and Max wait here. We won't give up easily. The match starts at six. Six o'clock sharp! Hi, Ms. Ben. Mr. Tos caught Kob with his phone. The brat even used your name as an excuse. Hello, Guide. What's up, Maprang? Is Kob with you? No. Ask Ohm's mom. She teaches at Kob's school. What are you talking about? Oh, so you didn't know? -Your presentation was amazing. -Thank you. Let me take you to dinner. That's very kind, sir. But I've got something urgent to do. -Go on then. -Thanks! Ms. Ben, where's Kob? He's in detention. Damn it. Okay. You find a way to get him out. I'll find a room with Wi-Fi. You've become a very aggressive boy. LIBRARY Look at your penalty points. One more slip and you're finished. And you've got the nerve to use Ms. Ben's name. When I report this to the director, I wonder if you could still be so cocky. Hey, did you pay any attention to what I said? I feel sorry for your parents. They work hard to pay for your tuition. But instead of studying, you create trouble. DIRECTOR WISET'S OFFICE AVAILABLE NETWORKS: DIRECTOR'S OFFICE Why didn't the janitor lower the flag? How could he abandon his duty? Hey, Kobsak! Where are you going? Stop right there! Ms. Ben, I've got Wi-Fi. Come to the director's office. Kobsak! What a trouble maker! Hey, Kobsak! Wait for me. Gosh, it burns. Kobsak! Oh, shit. Password? I'm fucked! Shit. "Greg Norman"? No. That's not it! Maybe Norman Greg? Wrong again. Norman111. Goddamnit! Do you know the password? WisetNorman. Got it. I'm in. I'm in. Bank's in. Max's in. -Where's Kob? -Kob. Where the hell are you? Kob's in! Help me in my lane, Ms. Ben. Coming. Don't rush in, Bank. I'm dead! I'll cover you. Shit, my battery! Find a charger. It's in here. There it is. I'll cover you. Keep playing. Hey, I'm still in the toilet. I'm still here! -Oh, my god! -A blackout, seriously? I was in the toilet, why did you turn off the light? Who the hell are you? I'm the school director. Help me, Maprang. Give me a second. "Director Wiset Kasiwara." It's really you. I'm sorry. I did not recognize you without your cowboy hat. I'm really sorry, Director. My hat? Right, I must have left it in my office. Could you turn on the light for a minute? -Oh, my! -Oh, gosh! It's back on. Go! -Get Dark Slayer first. -Okay. You shoot, I'll tank it. I got it. Go! Yes! Good job, everyone. We won. Cool. Ms. Ben? What's going on here? Just playing games, sir. Kob! Maprang! Are you guys okay? Are you hiding something from us? This Phone-Free Classroom project is your brainchild, right? Yes. And Ohm? Is he your son? Yes. Ohm's your son? What are you trying to do? Why did you lie to us? Say it. I want my son to quit playing games. So you're using us? Ohmgaga, right? I quit. Kob. HI, ORN. I ACCEPT THE LOAN AGREEMENT. Hi. Hi, Best. I agree to pay the compensation. Have you eaten, son? Ohm? Have you ever asked me what I want to do with my life? Have you ever asked me… what I want to do with my life? STUDENTS ON DISCIPLINARY PROBATION KOBSAK WONGVIJITSUK Max! Max! Max! Who are you? Max's not home. -I'm a teacher, my name's Ben. -A teacher? Is Max in trouble? No! He's not in trouble. What are you doing here? What did you do, Max? Pain in the ass. Do you know where Kob lives? Follow me. No worries, he's not in trouble. Where is it? We're almost there. There he is. Why can't you leave me alone? Get lost now. I apologize. But please don't quit. Don't quit what? School or games? I suck at everything anyway. So what's the point? I'll quit every goddamn thing. You lied to me. You lied to your own son. You lied to all of us. Yes, I lied to everyone. I'm selfish. I'm a bad teacher and a worse mother. But I never lied about one thing. I was so happy when I played games with you guys. I think my son must feel the same. I've made up my mind. I want to play with you again. I will set up an E-Sports club. Mom, when I grow up, I'll take you to a mountain where there's lots of snow. What will we do on the snowy mountain? We'll go skiing. Welcome to the Round of 16… -of Road to Arena of Valor 2019. -Of Road to Arena of Valor 2019. From a thousand teams from all over Thailand, we are down to the last 16. Only one of them will get to represent Thailand in the world championship in South Korea. What are you doing here? I'm here to cancel the agreement to pay the compensation. You have my permission to let Ohm compete. I'm a man of my word, ma'am. I removed Ohm after you called me. And now I trust my first-team squad. But Ohm is your best player. I agree with you on that, but Higher is Higher because we believe in teamwork. And now I believe in my team. Please leave now. Don't make things worse. Go back to your team. My guys need to concentrate. SCHEDULE Let's start with Ohmgaga. They've been amazing, don't you think? Ohmgaga is impressive on every front. At the start, they ran into some trouble in the bottom lane. But with Nakroth's Split-Push, they turned the situation around and won the game. Kobsak was brilliant. His AutoQ11 has done a great job. The first team to go through to the next round is… Ohmgaga! Higher is the tournament's favorite. But the team missed Ohm SonicFighter in the first round, and things didn't run smoothly. They won but it was a narrow win. Let's see if they'll bounce back in the next round. In the quarter-finals, Ohmgaga played with such astonishing teamwork. Especially Ms. BenJay. A real ass-kicker for someone her age. Such incredible skills. That's why Ohmgaga is the dark horse of the season. -It's good! -Kill it! Can Higher go any higher? Their coach comes prepared with a masterly playbook. They're doing much better than we expected. All in the mid lane. Maprang, go. Got it. -That's it! -Now, Ms. Ben. Go! Unbelievable! Ohmgaga has made it to the finals! They've played with such flair and team spirit. Ohmgaga is playing in the final round! -BenJay! -BenJay! -BenJay! -Stop. SCHEDULE Destroy the tower! That's it! Now we have the two finalists! Ohmgaga vs. Higher. It could also be Mother vs. Son! BenJay up against SonicFighter. Let's see who'll come out on top. This is the final game you can't miss! Get the marksman first. Locked, three, two, one! Ohmgaga is going full throttle. They move smoothly as one, up and down. BenJay, their marksman, is improving every second. Her skills are still limited, but her attacking moves are so clinical. And watch Maprang. Her timing is perfect. She was a substitute when she was with Higher. How is that? She's better than their first-team players! -I agree. -That's it. Go in and attack. Yes. -That was easy. -The all-time favorite Higher has lost the first game to Ohmgaga. This is going to be epic! Higher will have to come back stronger in the next game. Higher seems a little tense. They aren't at their best. Perhaps it's pressure from having lost the first game. Or it's because they don't have their talisman, Ohm, known as SonicFighter. Lock it for me. BenJay's items are full to the tilt! They're ready to close the book on Higher! Go! That's nice, keep going! There's a fight here. Watch BenJay closely. Her Valhein has crushed 007x so forcefully. Look at that! Another one bites the dust. THE BLUE TEAM'S CORE IS DESTROYED! Kobsak's Murad surged past everyone to get to the Core. It's done! Ohmgaga is up 2-0. Yes! Ohmgaga is up 2-0. Will Higher find a way to come back? See you after the break. We're screwed. You have to let Ohm play. Ohmgaga knows all our moves. We can turn things around. You have to believe in Higher's system. We've come this far and we will beat them. They play purely by instinct. No fucking qualification at all. They've been lucky since the first match. They will slip. Slip? How? They play like they can read each other's minds. We're a total failure. We play like shit. You have to admit that Ohm is our key player. Our plans aren't working because he's not here. Do you still think he's dispensable? Go get him then. This is our re-match, Ohm. Our victory would mean something only if we beat Ohm. Ohm, you wet fart, prepare to die! You'll cry like a baby when we beat the shit out of you. Fucking loser. Get your hands off me. Now, this is exciting! Ohm SonicFighter is taking his seat. Let's see if Ohmgaga will take it home or if Higher will live to fight another round. I'm here, go on! This isn't good. Go back! Take out Dragon. Dragon! My HP is low. Stall it. Wait for me. Go back! All in the mid lane. All in. An eye for an eye! Thanks. Go. Protect the Core. Destroyed! That's it! Higher has outclassed Ohmgaga. Ohm SonicFighter has turned the game around. He was superb as Kriknak. He rescued his team from a crisis. We have to credit Best for his choice of players too. It was brilliant! Told you to let Ohm play. Ohmgaga opts to ban Kriknak, played by SonicFighter. He was so good that the character is now banned. We call it a respect ban. It happens when a team bans another team's hero out of respect for exceptional skills. Kriknak is now out of the game. But banning Kriknak means they've freed other often-banned heroes like Elsu. Let's see if this ban is the right move. Because Higher is the Blue Side and will pick first. Ohmgaga had no idea that Higher would play Jungle Elsu. But Ohm SonicFighter will have to play in a new style, because usually, he prefers to play the assassin. Now he's moved to play the marksman. Let's see if Ohmgaga will be able to handle him. Why did he pick this hero? Ohm SonicFighter is a genius player! He's just unbelievable. This Jungle Elsu is really something! Maprang with a great run here. Bank with a slam-bang Cataclysm! That was smooth. Bank almost got hit but he backed away. A chance to use Ulti anyway. Did Romeo get his target? It's his payback from the last shot. Well, now what? There's a duel happening. A duel between AutoQ and Enictuz. Can he handle that? A terrible miss! It doesn't look good in mid lane. Max in the top lane. But SonicFighter is ambushing him. Max is down. It's going to be a tough call from there. A duel in Dark Slayer… AutoQ bamboozled him. Dead on the ground! Higher seems to enjoy more and more advantages. BenJay is farming too much in the mid lane. KritNgi came in from the left and solo-killed her. That's bad. BenJay is the team's main attacker. Ohmgaga are being taken out one by one. Their backs are against the wall. Why didn't Ohm finish off Ms. Ben himself? Let's keep going. AutoQ up against SonicFighter. It's a duel. But no, he's out! Higher finally did it. They beat Ohmgaga two games straight. The score is tied at 2-2. SonicFighter was instrumental in the turnaround of the game. They have won two games in a row, and now we're going into the final battle. What the hell was that, huh? I paid a lot for this jacket! Don't worry. I have a plan for Ms. Ben. We're going into the do-or-die final game. The winners will be the champions of Thailand. Ohmgaga has picked Raz. I don't know what they're thinking. Will they put Raz up against Nakroth played by SonicFighter? It doesn't look good because BenJay will play Raz. Unusual, because so far she has only played the marksman. This game is going to be so unpredictable. Raz versus Nakroth! It's BenJay against SonicFighter. Higher are switching plans. They know we know their moves. I'm fucked. Top Lane! They're heading to our Core! I'll warp there. You can't! It takes time to recall! DarkBlood alone won't be able to stop them. It's relentless! AutoQ as Volkath comes charging in! But hey, look at this battle. SonicFighter and BenJay, the son against the mother! If BenJay can stop SonicFighter's Nakroth, her team will have a chance of coming back. Can BenJay stop her son? Go for it, Mom. Don't let me down. Go for it, Mom. Don't let me down. Finally, we have the winner! BenJay took down SonicFighter, but it was SonicFighter's trap so that he could send minions to the Core, and AutoQ couldn't stop them. The winner is Higher! I'm sorry. I really sucked. You beat your son to a pulp. It's all right, Ms. Ben. We got further than expected. Ohmgaga is the coolest team anyway. Was it fun? You're so awesome, for real. How many math teachers have ever been in an RoV final? Right? Thank you. Give me a hug. So tell me, what is E-Sports? Sometimes people watch us play and say we are stupid for choosing wrong characters or taking impossible risks. But the thing is we can always try to stick with our style and strategy, adapt to our opponents, or deal with whatever's in front of us. FEBRUARY 8: OHM'S MATCH IN KOREA But still, there's no guarantee that we're making the right choice. We may think that a certain plan will lead to victory. But even with the best plan, we can still lose. Actually, E-Sports is like life. Why do you think you've been named the MVP or the most valuable player in this tournament? Of course it wasn't just me. My teammates are valuable players too. We're different, but we're a team. STUDY HARD. OKAY? I'LL CALL YOU WHEN I GET THERE. We fight in different lanes, but we always support each other. COME BACK SOON. I MISS YOU ALREADY. Whether you win or lose, they're always there for you. I'm the MVP because of them. And who is your MVP? My mother. After ten minutes, stop playing. Leave your phone here and retrieve it after school. Leave your phone here and retrieve it after school.
