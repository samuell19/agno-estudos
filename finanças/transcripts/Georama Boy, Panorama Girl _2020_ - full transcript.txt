Where did you go to? Go have a bath before dinner. Here's the milk. Why is it open? Where are the snacks? I gave them to an injured person. Hey, Mom! Hey, Mom! I'm gonna do my homework. Did she say homework? Ow! Idiot! Ow! Don't press so hard! Call yourself a nurse? Want me to hit you too? No, I'm sorry! I was only joking! Something happened at school? No, nothing. So how come? Don't worry about me. I'm gonna think about what to do. You only live once. You know-- You up and quit school and then got beaten up? You up and quit school and then got beaten up?

You have to tell her. I know. Don't expect me to help. Just seeing your face pisses me off! That hurts! - Hey! - Hey! - Sorry Sorry! Don't! I'm clearing up! "Student ID" "Year 3 Class 7, Kenichi Kanagawa" Daiichi High. He'd be cute without glasses. Really? Maybe not! I can't believe you spoke to such a weird guy. He was injured. I couldn't just leave him there. Trying to be a hero? Let's go and see Kenichi Kanagawa. We'll wait at his school gates. Yeah! "Meeting again by chance"! - Really? - Yeah! You know, maybe he likes you, and he dropped it on purpose. That's right! So, watcha gonna do, Haruko? Watcha gonna do? Come on, it's fate! Fate? We'll make it fate! Gonna go see him? No! But-- Are you sure? - No I don't! - Yes you do! I don't! Class has begun. Sit down. Class has begun. Pass these handouts around. There are 3 sheets. OK? Your nose is bleeding. Really? I'm joking. You were thinking naughty thoughts. This guy looks like such a geek, but maybe, just maybe-- It's not like I like him or anything. Oh. What do you mean by that? Nothing. Stop it! A female high school student living in an apartment in Tokyo's Arakawa Ward... A female high school student living in an apartment in Tokyo's Arakawa Ward... was found lying bleeding by a woman who lives nearby. The unconscious girl was rushed to hospital by ambulance, and was pronounced dead on arrival. The girl had left a note at the apartment hinting suicide, and according to her family, she was dreading going back to school after summer break-- What am I doing? People risk their lives to go to school, and I just up and quit. I sleep for 13 hours until noon and eat instant noodles. Maybe I made a mistake. Only 17, and I've already screwed up my whole life! Damn! What do I do? I'll go back to school and beg them to let me back in. But after what I did, I'd be too embarrassed. No, it isn't too late. Mr. Yamagata is on my side. But-- Why are you crying? - Why aren't you at work? - I went clubbing. - Why aren't you at work? - I went clubbing. - Why aren't you at work? - I went clubbing. What, all night? I'm on night shift for the next 3 days. For a nurse, you're too irresponsible. The world's gone mad! Blow your nose. Or do you want some comforting words? I'm so tired. I'm gonna have a bath and sleep. I don't need anything. Hey, you haven't cleaned the bath! Wanna bath? Clean it yourself! Huh? That's your job! While Mom isn't here, I have to cook your food and wash your dirty underwear! I'm sick of this. I was gonna clean it! You say you will, but you never do! Watch out! You quit school and sleep until noon! Alright, alright! You always run away when it suits you! Shut up, ugly! Most 17-year-olds are studying hard for their future! Shut up! Alright, alright! I'm sick of this. It was still just after noon, so I went to practice skateboarding. I gave up, and played lots of games at the arcade. Then I went to have a gratin, some drinks, and a panna cotta. I still had time, and I wanted to see her again. I want to see him again. I have a feeling that us meeting like that.. has the power to save Earth from a terrible calamity or something. I guess it was fate. Come on! Slow down. Maru! Look, he has glasses too! And if you meet him? She'll confess her love, of course! - No! - "I picked up your student ID." that's a bit, you know, like, moving too fast. Really? Haru, relax, relax! Haru, relax, relax! Look, over there! That guy with glasses. Over there. Is it him? I wish. Let's go! No! We look suspicious! "Daiichi High School" - Maybe we should ask. - Go on, then. Bye! Hey. wait! Run! What are you doing? You said you're often here. I was waiting for fate to bring us together. I was waiting for fate to bring us together. Hey, wanna go get some tapioca milk tea? You think all girls love tapioca, huh?

No, a bit further. My building isn't as big as that. They freak me out, those buildings. When we met before. I didn't know where I was going. I was just walking around. I got frightened. Here it is. See you. See you. Kenichi, pull the sheet tight. Tuck it in, and pull. I see. Tuck it in, and pull. - Like that? - That's great. Thank you. You're in a world of your own. Thinking about him again?

You took your time! Tokyo. Tokyo, monorail The scenes from my window All scrap-and-build Buildings rise, railroads race Pop up highway, get Lost subway Happy young crowd way! Tokyo, Tokyo, dungeon Shibuya Red lights, crosswalk white stripes Swaggering neon signs, loudmouth sound trucks-- I'm nuts about all of it! This town makes me grin and do a little dance. See? Tokyo Tower's alight. Open sesame, Tokyo life. Beautiful. Beautiful, isn't it? Cool. Cool, isn't it? Seeing it gives me energy. To go for it. Yeah, to go for it. Feels like the end of the world is approaching. All those things being decided. I don't like it. Are you alright? I'm enjoying it. Are you angry at something? You look so grim.

It's a waste of time trying. Even I don't know myself. It's fucked up. What is? You know-- That's my business. It's nothing to do with you. - How much do you charge? - Why do you ask? I wanna buy you, to keep you all to myself. Buy me? For real? You're so funny! You know-- You wanna buy me, like everyone else. Sorry, I'm very expensive. I want you to quit. It's just sex. Selling your body is the same as working at McDonald's. No it isn't. It's the same. - No. - What's the difference? - You know-- It's sad. Why are you being so tiresome? What I do is my business. I just wanted to have some fun. I'm sick of this. l'm gonna go to sleep. By the way. My price. For people I like, it's free. That's all. Haruko. Haruko. Are you alive? I'm dead. You look awful. Your mom was really angry. What's up? Kenichi Kanagawa has a girlfriend. She's an adult, and cute. I can't compete. Oh, right. see. Why didn't I imagine that possibility? Anyway, I had my first drink, and my first kiss with a boy. You did what? Then I ran away, and here I am. Don't laugh Sorry! But I'm glad you failed to get a boyfriend before me. You're horrible It wasn't meant to be like this! It isn't even 6 AM yet. It seems so long since I was dressing up to see Kenichi. Like a zillion years ago. That sounds like science fiction. Sometimes I think my world is different to everyone else's. As if only I exist. My mom, my dad, Natsu, they're all just illusions. So I'm just an illusion too? Yeah. Everything's an illusion. Everything. If that's true, then what should I do? - Here! - That's cold Which do you want? This one. It's cold! Coldness exists. Maybe this is real. I'm glad! - Sorry! - Sorry! Wait! This feels great! Haruko! A cop! In a few months, we can laugh this off as a youthful indiscretion. We were arrested. The bike's registered to a male. - It's her brother's. - What's his name? They found out we'd stolen it, that we were in high school, and that I'd been drinking. Kaede got off with a warning, Kaede got off with a warning, but I wasn't so lucky. "Haruko Shibuya" I'm not sure I'll be able to laugh it off after all. I'm sorry. I said I'm sorry. It's too late. You were arrested. I'm really, really sorry. I know I lied, but every high schooler drinks, so what's the problem? Maru and Kaede's moms just laughed and forgave them It wasn't an illegal event. You get a 6 PM curfew, and no allowance until graduation. Huh? You can't do that to me! If you need to buy something apply in writing. - I'm going to work. - Mom! You don't understand me at all! I was suspended from school for three days. and lost my chance to be recommended for college. I was pissed off about so many things. and didn't know what to do. I haven't spoken to my mom since then. "Haruko, I've gone to work. Your lunch is in the fridge. Mom" No school today? I said my stomach hurt, and left early. Kaede! Still not talking to her? You know, she's-- i see. I wish she was like your mom. I wish she was like your mom. - Barrier. - Barrier, huh? - Barrier. - Barrier, huh? - No barriers! - Run, run! My mom's not so great. Really? You know Marukin Bakery? - Marukin? - Yeah. Their cream puffs taste heavenly. If you taste one. you'll forgive anything. All your anger disappears, and you don't wanna fight. All your anger disappears, and you don't wanna fight. But they only make 100 per day. so they sell out straight away. Give them to your mom. How about it? Alright. Let's rob them. Bakery attack! You're crazy! Barn burning? Go on a wild sheep chase? We'll go to the hard-boiled wonderland at the end of the world! Is it that way? - No, that way. - But it says it's over there. - No, that way. - But it says it's over there. It's this way. It must be here. I guess. Hi, Haruko. Bye. What are you doing? Looking for those cream puffs. Oh, Marukin? Yeah. It's gone. Redevelopment. We've found a great place. - Come on, we'll show you. - Yeah, come on. Come on! We made an empty apartment into our secret base! Is someone there? - The hall, on the left! - Go on ahead. Haruko! Kaede? Where are you? Where are you? Huh? Where are you? Haruko, this way! Kaede? Kaede? Kaede! We're so high up,. Yeah. What? You felt it? Did it feel good? I was surprised. Hey. How was the kiss? The kiss? It was just a moment. I don't remember. The kiss? It was just a moment. I don't remember. You wanted to kiss him, even though you had no feelings for him? Even though he wasn't Kenichi? I don't knew what you mean. You've given up on him? Well, I don't know yet. So you still like him? Why are you being so mean? Why are you being so mean? Why are you being so mean? I think I'm jealous. Of who? I envy him. Being loved by you so much. Bitch. I can't stand it. You have no feelings for me, but you did all that. You wanted to do it. Like everyone else. I'm not like that. That's what they all say. Who needs love? Just sex is fine. I'll put it on your tab. Thoy are criticizing the government's stance on the Florida Treaty... on the use of nuclear weapons against asteroids approaching Earth... as destructive to Earth and the human race. I'm hungry. I'll make ramen. In Japan too, people opposed to attacks on unidentified alien life forms-- Why are they so angry? Dunno. Oh. Put a soft-boiled egg in mine. These eggs are out of date. I'll go buy some. Want anything else? Honest words, piercing rhythm, a cloudless blue sky, hope, freedom, the universe. Can't buy those. Hey, wanna go steady? No, I have no feelings for you. That's right. That's right. I wish I hadn't fucked you. I don't want to regret not doing anything. I hope our actions will make our future, our world... change into something better. What? Huh? Haruko. you thought I was-- No! That's not what I thought. Be careful. Haruko, have you grown? I'm 1.5 cm taller than last year. You're still growing? Just a little. Hey, Mom. What? When you were young, did you imagine this future? I didn't think about anything. I was always getting scolded for doing stuff. By your mom? I'm home. Welcome back. Huh? Right, it's time to make dinner. Game on! - You win! - Yeah! Think Haruko still likes him? Think Haruko still likes him? Haruko likes Kenichi Kanagawa. Kenichi Kanagawa likes somesine else. And that someone-- Probably likes someone else. It's tiresome. Kaede. Kaede. Thanks for the record. Thanks. About the other day-- You've asked him out? No. How can I? Oh. See ya. Tomorrow's your 17th birthday. Oh yeah, I fergot. Let's celebrate together. Come on. Laterz. Laterz. Bye. Bye. What? Where's Mayumi? Why are you here? To see her. What is Mayumi to you? She's gone to Guatemala. Guatemala? Guatemala. I, Haruko Shibuya, and I, Kenichi Kanagawa, in this moment, we passed each other like this. in this moment, we passed each other like this. He didn't look down on her, and she didn't look up to him. He didn't look down on her, and she didn't look up to him. It was just something that happens all the time. Looks good, doesn't it? Well? Has anything changed now you're 17? Nothing at all. I see. I'm still me. I thought I'd be enjoying life more when I was 17. I bet you'll say that in 10 years too! - Yeah! - Hey, Kaede! Taira's here. He's here! What? That's Kenichi. It's me! - Here he is! - You're late! Come on, we're gonna surprise her! - Surprise? - A surprise guest! What's this? Haruko, congratulations! Mission complete!

Aaargh! Get out! Everyone, get out! Aaargh! Get out! Everyone, get out! You don't understand me! Get out! My 17th birthday, and it turns out like this. My hot love all melted away, and now it's evaporated. That's how it is. Completely crushed, all an illusion. I deluded myself. What am I saying? I wanna cry. But crying right now would be a cliche, so I won't. No, I will. No, there's no way I'm gonna cry. Sorry for bringing you. You should just go home. I'm sorry. What is all this? Of course you don't remember me. I mean, it's stupid. I know nothing about you, and I fall in love and delude myself. I don't know what to do. There's something wrong with me. I don't know what to do. There's something wrong with me. I love you. Your nose is bleeding. Let's go. That was hard work. I'm tired. Why did you leave on your own? Because it's morning. I'll take you home. Think the trains are running? No, not yet. I'm hungry. Happy birthday. I should've said it before. How about... we get the train going away from home?

Only joking! - I wanna go somewhere. - Where? New-York, Paris, Tsukishima. Tsukishima? It's just over there. Not far enough? The moon, then! The people, the cars, everything looks like toys. Yeah, like you could grab them. Look at that flash over there. - Where? - Where? See? Over there. Oh, it's gone. - Did you see it? - No I didn't. Who's that? They're kissing. Where? Over there.
