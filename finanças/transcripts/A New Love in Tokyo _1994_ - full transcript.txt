Let's hear you moan like one! Moan like you mean it! Come on, faster! Come on. I think that this is a special skill for middle-aged women. I won't do this to a man unless he pays. Come to think of it, this is what they're really paying for. I wouldn't do it even for Ken-chan. But maybe I will after we get married. Ken-chan... Ken-chan... Well, back to work... You're going to study? No, that. It's a thing. So it's a thing. Ronin: One who is studying to pass the tough college entrance exams. Ken-chan has been a pre-med "ronin" for three years. But he will become a doctor. His father runs a large hospital in the countryside. Ken-chan's hobbies are sex and these crossword puzzles. It takes him about a month to finish one. I get the answers before he does most of the time. But I don't tell him because I don't want to injure his pride. Seems Ken-chan's not so hot in the literary department. I'm going to marry Ken-chan. Shibuya Station Why don't we just go home? Why don't we just go home? Are you still saying that? Are you still saying that? But I'm sleepy. Are you still saying that? But I'm sleepy. But I'm sleepy.

Hey! Hey! What? Look at this. Look, look, look! What? Ta-da...! ¥10 million... wow! It says that the deposit was made by my Dad. I was so surprised, so I called Mom... ...and she said that they made the deposit to help with our wedding! I've been telling my parents about you, Ken-chan. I told them that were firmly engaged. They don't waste any time, do they? But since this is for our wedding anyway, maybe we should just blow the whole wad now. Cool. I made that deposit, in my father's name, from another savings account. Ken-chan's parents will be glad that his bride is from a financially stable family. Ken-chan's going to be a doctor, and I'm going to marry him. What are you doing? The time is 11:40 p.m. I guess you're still hanging out at the theatre. Must be a lot of work. Good night. That's right, it's a lot of work. Making costumes, looking for props, taking out ads, selling tickets... It's me. It's 12:14 p.m., I'm going to lunch. Are you gone already? Are you still sleeping?

Haven't we had this conversation? Do you have to interrogate me every time? That's not my intention. But I always want to know how my girlfriend feels about me. It's only natural, isn't it? Well, I guess so. This guy's tongue calls me his girlfriend. Something's definitely wrong with this picture. We've been going out for a little over three months. Maybe it's the longest yet. I'm going to find three or four more by Christmas. The more friends, the better. Hey! What's the matter? Hey! What's the matter? Taxi. So he's an “unhatched doctor“, huh? So when's the wedding? Me, I don't care when it is. Even tomorrow would be fine. Huh...?! That one's still moving! It's a lot of work being an “S.” You have to improvise the drama. It's a great learning tool for acting. I know. We have it easy. I know. We have it easy. No more bets. But you have to lie a lot, don't you? Yeah. Nothing but lies. So this is your first time here? Yeah. We came just for the heck of it. Are you single? Students? My, such obvious flattery. You think? But you're out so late. I'm a call girl. I'm a call girl. I'm a dominatrix. We actually should be working now. We're not in the mood for it, so stop it with your lines. Yes. You both have such nice jobs. Thanks. Thanks. “Sindbad on the beach..." We're all dancing for you, so sing better than that.

Let me tell you about my Boss, whom some of you have already heard of. Ri: Old unit of distance-measurement (equivalent to 2.44 miles). He traveled 20ri north from Edo, past Isshikimachi in the Odawara district of Soshu province... ...to the town of Aomono, where he was known as Toraya Tohenmon of Rankan Bridge... ...but ever since he shaved his head, he's been known as Ensai. This medicine comes from from his native country, and now it's available year-round. A long time ago, a foreigner from Chin named Uirou came to visit the Palace. The Emperor decided to keep Uirou's medicine locked up in the Palace. He kept it hidden under his crown, and would pick off a bit when he needed a dose. He named the medicine “Tochinko.“ Those characters mean “the aroma that goes through your head.“ These days, the medicine has become very famous, and is known to most as... ...Odawara's Tochinko, but there are copies, such as Haidawara's, Sandawara's, and Sumidawara's. But the medicine of Ensai is the only one that's inscribed with the name “Uirou“ in hiragana. If any of you are planning to go to the hot springs at Atami or Tounosawa... ...or if you intend to go to Ise Shrine, please make sure to get it at the correct shop. If you're going towards Kyoto, it's on the right; if towards Edo, it's on the left. The shop has eight gables, three in front, in the chinese palace style. The official insignia of the chrysanthemum and the trunk of the paulownia prove its merit. “I Embrace Your Situation” Here's the script for our performance. This is the legendary sword of honor. “The sword of honor?“ Indeed. Only heroes are able to wield it. Yes, you've reached Cat Call. Six months at a Soapland would cover it. How 'bout it?

Kazuo is addicted to playing video-games at home. Nakamura, an ex-colleague, tries to bring him back into the gaming industry. But Sawako stands in his way... ...and Nakamura is in love with her. So it's a love triangle... Hey, why are you still playing those old games? You're weird. Programmers aren't supposed to get entranced by their own games. Miss Sawako, it's your turn. Excuse me, but Kazuo-san is a genius. There are aspects of him that can't be measured by a ruler. Get a load of that! There's someone on this planet who still thinks you're a genius. Just come back to us. Your job will always be there for you. I'm no genius. You're all mistaken. The fact that he doesn't know he's a genius makes him even more of a genius. Take some responsibility. It takes a lot of energy to keep on telling you you're a genius. More quail. Like I said... Oh, got you... Like I said, just leave me alone. It's my hobby to care for you. Don't you have other hobbies? Don't you have other hobbies? I have no other hobby but you, Kazuo-san. Building plastic models? Canoeing? What? Canoeing? What's canoeing? Is that fun?

Come in making a ruckus. Yes. Let's take it from the preceding line. How would I know? It just popped out of my mouth, that's all. We're coming in! You can't come in uninvited. We invited ourselves!

The police are treating it as a murder, and are continuing to investigate. The police are treating it as a murder, and are continuing to investigate. I wonder if we're closing for today. The police are treating it as a murder, and are continuing to investigate. The police are treating it as a murder, and are continuing to investigate. It's going to be really busy today. It's going to be really busy today. According to what the employee reported... it's going to be really busy today. According to what the employee reported... According to what the employee reported... Huh? From what I hear, most places aren't opening today; it's our chance to clean up. Of course, she's young and has lovely skin... Yes, thank you very much. Nagisa, it's Mr. Suzuki at the Submarine, room 202... Hello, this is Club Culottes. Yes. Thank you very much. And her name? Oh, I'm so sorry, she's on menstrual leave 'till tomorrow. Do you have another preferred girl? One moment please. Club Poetrene. Yes, Mr. Sato. You don't know how to get to the hotel? Where will you be coming from? Ayumi. I saw the news. ls everything okay? Fine, fine. This is a chance to make a bundle. I hardly have time to go back to the office. You're tougher than you look. Didn't you know? Didn't you know? I knew! If I run into a creep, I'll beat him up. Want to borrow my whip? Could I? ls that okay? Sure. I've got tons of them. Looks like another call... yep... look... Unreal. This one really packs a wallop; one strike and they're down for three days. Really? Could I see it? Wow. This is fun! You're a natural, Ayumi. Thanks for this. Maybe I should change my line of work. Sure, you're such a liar. You think I am? You think I am? You're completely talented at it. Hey, will you buy a ticket? Oh! Come see it with that unhatched doctor of yours. These were just printed today. Rei, you're good at sales, too; you waste no time. It's the candy-and-whip principle. It's the candy-and-whip principle. Does that apply in this case? Please come in. Hello, this is Ayumi. I'm getting started. And can you order me a spaghetti dinner delivery for later? A spaghetti dinner? Okay. Good luck. Will you step over me? Our address is Dogenzaka 301, we'd like a delivery of three orders of spaghetti. Yes. Right. Wait. Cancel that! Cancel that! Cancel the spaghettis! Yeah? Yeah? Emergency! Ayumi called in a spaghetti! What? What? Should I call the police? Should I call the police? Idiot! Should I call the police? Excuse me, my name's Nakayama. ls Mr. Jiro there? I'll shave it clean for you. What? This thing's so sharp. Please, don't. Please, don't. Please... please what? Please stop... Yes? I'm from the front desk. What do you want? Will you please open the door? Coming! Coming! Wait... wait. Come back here! Hey! Manager! What's going on? What's going on? I'm from the Tendo-kai gang. Say, bro... ...I need your cooperation... ...to help make this a safe town for all of us. Yes. Ayumi, I'm so glad you're okay. Thanks for recognizing the signal. Yes, Club Poetrene. Yes. Umm... I'll go. Miss Sakuma? Miss Sakuma? Yes. Yes. This way, please. Yes. This isn't good. It might be gonorrhea. Let's check it internally. Take off your underwear and go there. You're going to check internally on this? That's right. Can I pass on the internal check? What are you talking about? You're sick. You've drunk a lot of my pee, haven't you? P-pee? Can't you just give me the medicine? A dominatrix could never let herself be seen in the stirrups. As luck would have it, the doctor I randomly visited was a client. Store Sign: “Dream Kiss" Store Sign: “Dream Kiss" STOP IT! Stop it! I'm not a braggart! Stop it! I'm not a braggart! What's the matter? What's the matter, Kazuo? Kazuo? Huh...? Hmm... maybe you've been playing your game too much. I'll go get you a glass of water. Oh, yeah... I've got to keep playing. Curtain opens. We have been waiting for you, Lord Kazuone. Why are you barging in uninvited? What are you saying? Aren't we fellow soldiers of Grizoridonia, who fight together? Where am I? This is the world that you yourself have programmed: The Magic Kingdom! I shall continue my divination. And who are you? Oh, look, Kazuone. See the princess reflected in Grizelda the Witch's crystal ball. Princess...? Sawako! Are you coming to swim with us today? Sure, but you guys go on ahead of me. Rei. It's my turn today. I'm sorry. I can't for a while. Huh...? Are you not feeling well? Venereal disease. Yikes! Spaghetti. Come to think of it, all of you should go get checked at the hospital. Take care. Group meeting! The issue here is that we have to trace Rei's infection, and how far it has spread. I think, firstly, that it might be from one of us... ...or a client, or Rei's lover, or someone of that ilk. Yes. I don't think that it's one of the clients. How do you know? Rei said that she lets her clients ejaculate but she never has sex with them. Could it be her lover, then? We lack information. We'll consider those possibilities, but... I... You...? To be honest, I've never been with any girl other than Rei. So... You're judged not guilty. I... lately I feel itchy. For about two or three days, it's been painful to pee. I've had something like pus on the tip. But I've heard that you could get that without having sex. Well, you can't say that public baths and pools are 100% safe, but... ...the pain and itching might be related to other physiological factors. Shouldn't they be concerned about finding out what kind of venereal disease it is? Anyone have a medical encyclopedia? Let's go to the hospital. It won't be as scary if we all go together. AIDS would be bad. Sign: “Hojo Medical Clinic" Sign: “Venereal Disease Department“ How did it go? How did it go? Was it AIDS? No way, I hope. Was it AIDS? No way, I hope. You're okay, right? Was it AIDS? No way, I hope. You're okay, right? You're okay, right? Was it herpes? Was it herpes? You're okay? Was it herpes? You're okay? You're okay? Syphilis? Syphilis? Are you guys okay? Syphilis? I better go buy some condoms. Hey. HEY- HEY- Hey. Gonorrhea? Hey. If all of us got treatment together, it won't be as scary, right? We're making lots of headway. We're making lots of headway. I don't think so. You think so? Maybe here? Hmmm... Hmmm... The yellow one. The yellow one. Yeah, because that's yellow. The yellow one. Hey, Toru. Hey, Toru. Hmm...? Should we have dinner after this? I want to finish the yellow pan first. Right now... I want to finish this fish pan. This piece? This piece? We'll have to find the fin. We'll have to find the fin. The fin... We'll have to find the fin. You need to get better at this. Toru is a literature major, but he's studying to become a lawyer. Toru's hobby is jigsaw puzzles. When I did it secretly by myself, I was able to complete it in a day. But working on it together, it's already taken us three weeks. Maybe Toru's not good with aesthetics. My dream is to become a lawyer's wife. It's finished. It's finished. I opened a new bank account yesterday. I transferred ¥10 million into it using my father's name. You're the one in charge? How do you do? Is that any way to speak to me? What way? What's with your attitude? I'm a customer. If you're here to kid around, you better just leave. I'm not kidding around. I'm just tired of regular sex with regular women. I came here hoping that a whole new world might open up for me. I feel that there's a psychological undercurrent to S&M... ...something more than the one-dimensional aspects of physical stimulation. To put it boldly, it takes on the appearance of sex, and yet... ...it's a kind of philosophy, or a kind of religion. Could you accommodate these ideas? Those things don't bother me. If that's what you want, I'll be your Sartre... or even your Jesus. Now that's the spirit. Anyway, just take off your clothes. Aren't you taking yours off, too? I'll do things my way. So you begin by putting someone in a restricted situation. It would be the correct introductory step. I see. Hey! This isn't what I ordered! Take these things off! Take the shackles off! Hey! Hey! This is what you need. I'm throwing your clothes away. What, you're finished already? Just taking a break. Huh...? I got a tough one to break in; it's been a while. Oh... Is it a Rei Special? Bastard! Say that again to my face! Get out of here! Just who do you think I am? Where's your sense of decency? Huh? Say something! Bastard! Moron CEO! Who are you calling a bastard? You're the bastard, aren't you? Enough is enough! Enough is enough! Enough out of you! Layoffs! Layoffs! Is that all you can say? Are we a company or a zoo?! What is this? What's this thing? Why's it all swollen? Explain yourself. Explain yourself. Mistress, it's Acme, Acme. How's that? What are you talking about?! CEO bastard! CEO bastard! We get these types from time to time. Bastard CEO. I'm off. I'm off. See ya. Maybe I can be back by lunch. Fine. Fine. I'm off. I'm off. See you. I'm off. Yes, Club Soiree. Oh yes, thank you. One moment please. Rei-chan, it's Sawanobori. What time are you available? I can do it right now. The current customer's going to take a while. I should open a branch office and have you run it. And then she laughed. She says she could do it right now. Can you come? Yes. Yes. It's all right. It's all right. Yes. My member number is 172, Sawanobori. You gotta be kidding... Of course, I know it's you. I had a feeling it might be okay, sol called from downstairs. Forgive me. No jokes, please. It ruins the atmosphere. Right, Rei? I'm sorry. I know that you know that you're going to get punished for this. Is that right? Yes. Please excuse me. Yes. What? So the Kurosaki group has flown the coop, huh? Okay, take Maeyama hostage, and fast. But treat him well for now, no rough stuff. Okay, I'll be back soon. It's rude of me I know, but today, due to unexpected business... ...I must excuse myself. I shall make amends for this. I'm very sorry. Wow... scary! He'd done nothing for five years. But I think he was fighting an inner battle the whole time. He'd done nothing for five years. But I think he was fighting an inner battle the whole time. By virtue of doing nothing, I believe that he was fighting with something. I used to be a fighter myself once upon a time... I'm back. I'm back. Welcome back. Welcome back. How's the situation? Welcome back. The more he treated me harshly the kinder I became toward him. The more he treated me harshly the kinder I became toward him. Scary, isn't it... Isn't it lonesome? What can save you now? Your knowledge...? Your strength...? That's right. Now you understand. I'm the only one who can save you. And you have no choice but to obey me. Understand? I'll take this off now, so you can reply. I said reply! I said reply! Yes! Now you'll attend to everything I say, won't you? So you still can't let go of your ego? I understand! I understand! I'll listen to everything you say! We must also fix the way that you speak to me. Help! Forgive me! Forgive me! Mistress! Mistress! Very well. You'll make a good slave. Dear Mom, tomorrow is the day our play opens. I'm so nervous that I'm shaking, but... ...m y body just spontaneously began to dance. Though I can't use it in my play, lam truly grateful, Mom... ...that you insisted that I study ballet. Really, thank you. Poster: “Dream Kids Theatre Group: Their fifth performance: I Embrace Your Situation” Banner: “Congratulations: To Sakuma Reiko, from your #1 fan" Boss, I bought up all the tickets. Good. Now go give them out near the theatre. I got free tickets! Here you go! Hey, guy, look at this! Come on, check it out! Hey missie, I've got a free ticket here! Hey bro, it's a free ticket! Go ahead! Hey, sis! Wow, you're pretty! The show's at 6:30! The Dream Kids want you in the audience! “Dream Kids?“ Never heard of 'em. Hey mister CEO! Go see the play! I don't want any money! Go see it, okay?! I got free tickets! Hey, sharp-lookin' dude, go see the show! I got free tickets. Hey! Hey bro, wanna see some sweaty hot babes?! This is your free chance! Hey, sister, yey, it's for free! Hey, sister, yey, it's for free! Boss... “Big Brother:" superior in the gang. Big brother... “Big Brother:" superior in the gang. Big brother... This ain't working. This will not do... Add on free tickets to the J-league soccer game! Why is that? It's kind of strange. That's how you approach me. And the closer you approach, the smaller you look. That's against the laws of perspective. The closer I get to you, the smaller I become? That being the case, can't you just think of me as cuddly and cute? You're very cute. I just want to embrace you. It's okay. Hug me any time you want. If you can cry for yourself... If you can cry about how sorry you feel for yourself... ...for having been taken advantage of by a man like me... ...then I'll embrace you anytime... Anytime. You make everything so complicated. You're so complicated, that's what I like about you. You just don't understand. You just don't understand. What? We're absolutely... hopelessly... endlessly... ...in a very complicated situation! Lord Kazuone, it is time to depart. I've been waiting for you guys! Everyone, it's finally the day we battle the Boss character! Let's do it! Let's do it! What about Princess Saeko, who is still missing? The closer she gets, the smaller she becomes. The farther she goes... ...the larger she appears. Let us go afar! Let us go afar! Let us go afar! Come on, I'll take them on. I've been bored doing nothing for five years. Pay back your debts! I don't pay back debts! Die! Take that! What kind of selfish hero are you? I've been selfish for five years, why should I change now? What are you talking about? About our... about our... adventure! He'd done nothing for five years. But I think he was fighting an inner battle the whole time. By virtue of doing nothing, I believe that he was fighting with something. I used to be a fighter myself, once upon a time. When he could do nothing for himself, I kept on taking care of him. Kazuo, what I did become was a burden to you. I burdened him. And he has borne my burden. Then he'd take out his stress on me, and the more he would take it out on me... ...the kinder I would become toward him. And this mutual kindness... And this mutual kindness... ...had been our adventure together. Kazuo-san! Let's begin a new adventure together, Sawako. A new adventure? A new adventure? We must become independent, Sawako. Sawako, the game is over. We have to reset and replay. Where are you going on that tuna boat? To catch tuna! I found this job in “FROM A“ magazine. How cool! A computer geek like me will now rub elbows with bronze-skinned fishermen. I'll mingle with them, I'll get beaten up by them... ...and I'll catch tuna! I'll catch tuna! Come back to me. I'll be waiting for you! All aboard! I... will be waiting for you, Kazuo. That's okay, isn't it? You can let me exercise that option. It's my choice. Don't forget about me. Bear your burden. If you can't bear my little burden, then you certainly won't be able to carry a 2-meter long tuna! Become a real man, and come back to me. Nagai Hideo. Thank you very much. Hosokawa Sakura. Thank you very much. Kitazawa Kiyoshi. Miura Yoshikazu. Thank you very much. Hashiratani Tetsuya. Takeda Osamu. Thank you very much. Sakuma Reiko. And so our festival comes to an end. Festivals make us joyful. Now on to the next festival. An even more joyful and greater festival. I... Thank you all very much for coming. We are having a small wrap party here. Whether or not you were involved in the pro- duction, you're most welcome to stay. Rei... Rei! Ayumi...! 'scuze me... That was great. Congratulations. Thank you. It was great! I didn't understand it, but it was really great! You liar. Gimme a kiss, whoever you are. We did it! Hold it right there! I know I stepped out of line. I'm aware that I'll be punished for it. You knew about this? We have ways of finding things out. Forgive me. Thank you. Was he crying? Maybe it's because you're such a great kisser. Okay, everyone Great job! Great job! And also... And also... What? Cheers to our recovery. Cheers. Cheers! What recovery? We all had VD. What?! How about that, huh? Stars! On nights with shooting stars... ...let's both of us... ...dance together. Listening to the Bossanova, our fingertips touch... It's a night of love. A soft and chilly wind... ...kisses my cheek. But the two of us... won't say a word. Only our eyes stare at each other... ...at the street corner. On the night of the blue moon... ...let us both aimlessly... ...walk together. In the breeze we hear... ...the sound of shoes. It's a night of love. Even if people are mean... ...and try to tear us apart... ...we will sing. You don't have to say a word. Just look into my eyes... ...at the street corner. How's the pre-med doing? Didn't I tell you? I'm living with a would-be lawyer. Yet another wannabe... I'm going to be the wife of a lawyer! And what does he think you do for a living? Assistant director on a late-night radio show. It's so convenient. That's a good one. If it weren't for this load I'm carrying, I'd hang out with you guys some more. Let's go out drinking again. Can you go tomorrow? Sure I'll go. And what was the name of your radio station? Woops... Alright guys, goodnight. Goodnight. Goodnight. Take care. Take care. Good night! Take care. Good night! Good night! See you later. Shall we go? Shall we go? Where? Where? The sea. Where? I'm in. But how do we get there? How do we get there...? Shall we pick up some guys? I'll bet there are plenty still roaming around. Let's go! We're here! Watch where you're going! Do you even have a license? Of course not! What?! We're here. I can't believe we're still alive. What are we going to do about the car? Hey, why don't we play an S&M game? Huh?! You're into that? S&M! This isn't S&M! Get us out! Yes, I love you baby, yes, I do. I'll be looking all night long, long, long...long...long... Distant blue starlight falls on the beach. Tomorrow, tomorrow will eventual! y arrive. Distant blue starlight falls on the beach. ...and tonight, tonight, there are sprays from crashing waves. Those pretty shining stars are the chandeliers of the night sky. 'Til dawn, 'til dawn, let's dance together 'til dawn. Yes, I love you baby, yes, I do. I'll be looking all night long, long, long...long...long. Distant blue starlight falls on the beach. Tomorrow, tomorrow will eventual! y arrive. Tomorrow, tomorrow will eventual! y arrive. I'm home. Huh? Who cares! Preparations for a festival begin tomorrow, again. Starting tomorrow. And it's going to be super-fun, again. Starting tomorrow. And it's going to be super-fun, again. What kind of ﬂowers were blooming on that forgotten day? Who was around me then ?
