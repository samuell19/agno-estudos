Art is taking a nap in your room. Chicago calling ... Chicago calling ... Chicago calling. This is Los Angeles. Almost two million people live here. As neighbors. They brush against each other in the streets. Never to meet again. Most of them. On this particular morning at seven twenty-three. A boy lifted a crate of lettuce off a truck. A woman was tacking on official roses on a hat. A lineman was making an emergency repair. Others ... an executive ... a policeman. A policeman ... a waitress. A foreman ... an engineer. They were starting off the day like any other day. Not knowing that they had already been singled out. To test a man's faith in his fellow man. Nancy. Hello. Daddy. Daddy. Where have you been, Daddy? >> Hey, what did you do to your face? Oh, nothing. >> You've been in a scrap, haven't you? Who with? Roy. Who started it? >> I did. He said something mean, so I hit him. And then he hit me back. Well, what did he say? Well .. >> Lick. Come on, let's have it. I don't want to leave you Daddy, ever, ever! Who says you're going to? Roy said it served you right that Mummy and I were going away. Where'd he get that idea? I only told him what Mummy told me. Tell me Nancy, what exactly did Mummy say to you? She said we were going to Baltimore to stay with Grandma. Did she say anything else? You know we never have any secrets from each other. What else was it? Well, I asked Mummy why you weren't coming with us. And she said we were going away because .. Don't you and Mummy love each other any more? Oh darling. We all love each other very much, you, Mummy and I. You know that, don't you? Maybe it's been my fault we haven't been getting along too well. But we're not going to be separated if we can help it. I'll go up and speak to Mummy. You run back and play and forget what Roy said. Nancy. Just the same, thanks for sticking up for me with Roy. Okay, Daddy. Mary? >> Yes. Where are you? >> In here. Hello honey. >> Hello. I bet you never knew your daughter had a nasty right-hook did you? What happened? Oh Roy kept needling her about something, so she sailed right into him. Is she alright? >> Not a scratch. What are you doing there? >> Packing. Where're you going? >> That shouldn't be too hard to guess. Oh, come on Mary, snap out of it will you. You know you don't mean it. Don't I? I know you're sore because I didn't come home last night. I'll tell you why. I'm not asking. I stopped in at Pete Sherman's. We started to gab about old times. And then some friends of his dropped in and before we knew it, it was two o'clock. I figured you'd be asleep by then so, I bunked in with him for the rest of the night. Honest, Mary. It's the truth. >> I believe you. No you don't. You must admit I've been pretty good about my drinking theses past 3 months. Have you? Well, I did fall off the wagon a little bit last night. I did it more as a favor to Pete than anything. Now I'm back on the wagon again. Would you get that hat-box off the shelf for me? It's not such a small closet after all. Once it's empty. Alright Mary ... I did get tight. So I stayed at Pete's because ... because I was in no condition to come home. I'm sorry. I'm awfully sorry. Oh Mary, I love you! I can't let you go. I promise I'll behave myself from now on. Honest I will. Give me one more chance. I'm going to show you. You were going to show me before. Last week, last month, last year! Only a week ago you promised you'd never touch another drink. You'd get a steady job. I worked steady at Bergman's for 3 months until they started laying people off. That's your story. Mr Walker told me that you were fired! That you didn't show up for work for two days in a row. I only took time off because Ben thought we could make money promoting his invention. That's the whole trouble. You always want to take short-cuts. It wasn't my fault it didn't work out. Please Bill ... let's not argue any more. I've made up my mind. I'm leaving. You know what it will do to Nancy? I'd have left long ago if it hadn't been for her. William R. Cannon. Voted most likely to succeed out of a class of 52 aspiring photographers. I hope you're proud of me. Here! Here's a present for you. You'd better take it with you. It will remind you of the old days when I was a success. Remember when we got married, I had just completed a course in aerial gunnery. I flew 35 successful missions against the enemy. Oh stop it William. I haven't told you about our successful marriage yet. Bill, please, I beg you .. Mary. >> Please. No. Bill, don't, don't. Oh darling, don't leave me. Please don't leave me. Mummy! Listen Nancy, please tell Mummy you want her to stay here. Tell her I love you both much too much to ever let you go away. Tell her Nancy. Please tell her. I don't want to leave Daddy. Nancy, go into the kitchen and feed Smitty. Go on! Do as I tell you. Bill. Please try to understand. I'm not leaving you because I don't love you. I still do ... I think I always will. But I just can't wait until everything has died between us. I wouldn't mind so much that .. .. that you had trouble getting jobs, and that we're poor, but .. But I've lost faith in you .. .. and that's the worst thing that can happen to a marriage. Can't you see? The only hope for the future is to get away from each other now. If you leave now, I know you'll never come back. It's up to you Bill. If you'll just straighten out ... and prove to me that I can have faith in you. I'll come back. I will Bill. When are you leaving? Tomorrow morning. I answered one of those "Share The Ride" Ads and .. .. talked to some people who'll take me and Nancy to Baltimore for thirty dollars. Thirty dollars? I .. I pawned the brooch you gave me for my birthday ... and my wedding ring. You're not going to do that. I have an appointment to meet those people at ten o'clock. I'll get you the money. Smitty, I wish we weren't going in that silly old car so you could come along. But you keep Daddy company. Promise you'll be a good boy and not run out on the street and chase Mrs. Kelly's cat. Daddy, Mummy said I'd have to leave Smitty with you. You'll take good care of him, won't you? Sure Nancy, you know I'll take good care of him Now, let's get you cleaned up a bit. We're all going out for a walk. And I noticed you haven't tidied up your room yet. Mummy. Mummy. >> Yes dear? What's Daddy doing in there? >> He's getting the money for our trip. Is he selling his camera? >> No, no he's not selling it. But the man just took it. Well Daddy will get it back. >> How? When he goes to work again. How can he go to work when he don't have his camera? "Doesn't" have his camera. >> Doesn't have his camera. Mummy. Please darling, just don't ask so many questions. Okay. How about a ride, Nancy? We haven't got much time Billy. I've called a cab. Let her have one. I don't care Daddy. >> Yes, you do. I want to see you ride one of those big horses over there. Can I Mummy? >> Sure, darling ... run along. Help me! >> Alright ... up you go. I don't need a belt, Daddy. Okay, but you just hold on tight, so it won't buck you off. I will. Mary? >> Yes, William. You going to write to me? >> Of course. Let me know how you're getting along? Of course. When I went overseas, we'd talk just the way we're talking now. Only you the one who said "write to me". I guess people always say the same things when they leave each other. Yeah, I guess they do. Mary, I'm not coming home tonight. I don't want to be there in the morning to say goodbye to you in front of those strangers. So I'm going to say it now. What about Nancy? It'll be easier for her too, if I'm not there. Give her a big ... hug and a kiss for me. Goodbye Mary. Goodbye Bill. Please take care of yourself. Alright darling. Put Smitty inside. Let's go. Nancy, hurry darling. They're waiting. >> Alright. Get your coat. I see your folks going away on a little trip. Sure picked a beautiful day for it. They sure did. I've told you before a hundred times. I don't want my house turned into a saloon. Oh come on Christine, the fellows were only having a little close harmony. That's not what the cops called it. Okay, so we did get sweet out of line, but we were just having fun. Fun! You all but wrecked my house! Glasses broken. Liquor spilled on my new rug. And cigarette burns in the easy-chair. Okay, sweetie, I'll buy a slip-cover for the chair. Look, it's seven-thirty. I've got to get going. You take him with you. >> Oh, let him sleep it off. Hey Bill, wake up. Bill! Wake up. What time is it? >> Seven-thirty. How'd I get on this couch? >> I don't know. What time did we break up? I don't know. Look Bill, I'd ask you to have some breakfast but .. .. Christine's a little upset this morning. We did kind of, mess the place up. Bye sweetie! Be home around six. Don't bother about dinner. We'll grab a bite some place and catch an early show. I hope she won't take this out on you. >> Don't worry. I'll cool her off tonight. So long Pete. >> So long Bill. Hey, you mister Cannon? >> That's right. I'm from the telephone company. I've been here a couple of times before, but you were never in. Yeah, I've been away. I've got orders to remove your phone. Okay ... come on in. There it is over there. Help yourself. What day is this? Wednesday. >> Hold it. Hold it, will you. For what? Don't take the phone. I've got to have it on. Well, it's a little late for that mister. It's already disconnected on the pole outside. This wire's from my wife. She says they've been in a car accident in Chicago. My little girl's been hurt. She's going to call me here tomorrow, on this phone. Well, you'd better have her call you at another number. This line is dead. I don't know where to get in touch with her. She doesn't say where she's staying. Or what hospital my little girl's in. Give me a break will you? Look mister, this phone was supposed to be out of here three days ago. Well, I didn't know the bill was that long overdue. I told you I've been away. You must have had a couple of notices before this one. Well, maybe I did. But I'm going to take care of it. Just give me a few hours, so I can go down to the office and get it straightened out. I'm not supposed to do that. If I hadn't have come home just now .. .. you wouldn't have been able to take the phone out anyway! Give me a break, will you. Okay. I'll mark the order "no access to premises" again. Thanks. That's swell of you. >> And don't tell anyone you even saw me. I won't. Now ... where'd I put that bill? Here it is. >> How much do you owe? Fifty-three dollars. What did you do? Call somebody in China? Oh. A guy roped me in on some crazy promotion schemes selling a gadget he invented. We called it "Prospects Of A Creation". And like a real pal, he blew town and left me holding the bag. There's one born every minute. Well look, I'll be in touch with the office all day. As soon as they give me the okay on you, I'll come back and re-connect you outside. I sure appreciate it. >> Good luck. Look Pete. I'm pretty sure that if I pay twenty-five on this bill, they'd give me an extension. If you can talk Christine out of twenty-five bucks, you're a better man than I am. Why don't you call her? You know her, it won't do no good. How about your boss? Couldn't you get an advance from him? Look, I only started working here last week. You could show him the telegram from Mary if you want. I got it right here. No ... no I don't want to show him. Scrambled, no fries. Pete, you're the only guy I know well enough to go to. You've got to help me. What about Bob ... what's his name? >> Kowalski? You were pretty chummy with him, weren't you? He moved to San Diego. Well, what about Fisher? I already owe him some dough. You owe me some too, but I haven't asked you for it because I know you're broke. Is that why you don't want to help me out now? No ... I'm still paying off the car. Christine's sisters come out here from Buffalo on a visit. You know how it is. But look, Pete. This is an emergency. I'm good for twenty-five bucks! Bill, I want to tell you something. You're a good guy and all that. But not good for twenty-five bucks. And I always thought you were a friend of mine. I am. Okay, Pete. Stay here. All I'm asking is, to give me a one-day extension. You see these letters? Every one of them from people asking us to install new phones. Grant extensions and so forth. Every one of them an emergency case. Come in every day by the dozen. Now I ask you ... where should we draw the line? Why couldn't I have this call from my wife transferred to another phone? Well, I'm afraid that's impossible. First of all, there are a great number of long-distance operators. No telling where the call would come in. And second, no record is kept of incoming calls. But that sounds incredible. It may sound incredible to you, but contrary to general belief. Incoming long-distance calls cannot be transferred. Unless there is someone at that number when the call comes in. And your phone has been disconnected. But, why don't you call your wife in Chicago? I wouldn't know where to reach her. If you could get the money to me before five tonight or first thing in the morning. I'd have your phone reconnected within an hour. Isn't there some friend you can turn to? I've only lived in Los Angeles a little while and the people I know are broke too. It seems there must be some way for a man in your predicament to raise 50 dollars. You look like a decent sort. Would you be willing to help me out with a personal loan? Well ... you can hardly expect me to .. I mean .. uh.. You see? Thanks anyway. We'll let you know in a couple of days, Mr. Cannon. In a couple of days? But I need the money now. Oh relief agencies don't work that way, Mr. Cannon. If you need the money that quickly .. .. perhaps you'd better go to one of those finance and loan companies. Thank you. Oh but .. Thank you. True! Very true ... fifty dollars would be considered a small loan. Unfortunately, we've found from experience that small loans are our poorest risk. Well why not make it a hundred, then? My dear friend, I'd gladly loan you even more. With proper collateral of course. What do you people call "proper collateral"? Oh .. a car, a house, furniture, jewelry. Is that all? Listen. If I were a millionaire, why would I be here? That's right. Then tell me Mr. Cannon, how much income tax did you pay last year? I didn't pay any. >> Oh, well .. You can see that under the circumstances. Your hands are tied. That's one way of putting it. Thank you. >> But you're welcome. Anyway, you kept your promise. You were quick, friendly and confidential. Sorry. Perhaps you could apply to one of those relief agencies. Have you got any soup? >> Navy bean, or tomato. Navy bean. Say Miss, do you happen to have any leftovers for my dog? Sorry, no leftovers. How much are your hamburgers? >> Two bits. Just the meat? >> Two bits. Okay, give me one. I've got some fresh coffee now Mr. Blake. Can you get that coffee for me. >> Yes sir. Anything wrong with the soup? No. What's the matter? You sick? I'm okay. For me? >> Sure. I didn't order any coffee. >> That's okay. No charge. Thanks. I appreciate it. What's the trouble? No job? That's only part of it. >> What's the other part? Oh, it's a long story. I got no place to go. Alright. My little girl's in a hospital in Chicago. My wife's going to call me about it tomorrow. They've taken my phone out because I'm broke. What's wrong with your little girl? >> She was in an accident. Is she hurt bad? I don't know yet, but I think so. They are operating on her tomorrow. Pardon me, mister. But I couldn't help overhearing what you just told Peggy. A friend of mine has got a new radio program and a national hookup .. .. called "Help Thy Neighbor". A human interest show. People come, they tell their troubles. They get terrific responses from the public. Money, jobs, everything. I could arrange for you to go on the air the day after tomorrow. What do you say? Thanks for the suggestion, mister. I don't believe in human interest. And I'm not going to make a spectacle of myself. Spectacle? You don't understand. >> I understand alright. Your friend is an expert on people's troubles. They can make old ladies weep in front of their radios. I'm not going to be the one they're weeping over, so just, forget about it will you. Well, okay. [ dog squeals ] I didn't mean to hit him, mister. He was right in front of me. I wasn't going fast but I couldn't stop. What is it, Smitty? Your leg? It isn't broken is it? >> No, I don't think so. I'm sorry mister, I'm awful sorry. Oh that's alright. It wasn't your fault. I'd better take him home. Where do you live? >> Just down the street. How much do I owe you? >> Forty-five cents. How's your dog? >> He'll be alright, thanks. Just a moment. Mr. Blake asked me to give you this five .. He said he understood you were upset, and to use the money on your phone bill. I don't know what to say. >> Don't say anything. Just take it. If you see him again, will you thank him and apologize for me. Sure. Just forget it. Good luck to you. >> Thanks. You going to be five bucks short tonight. Why don't you mind your own business. You don't have to come any farther. I like all the way up. Thanks a lot Bobby. >> Can I come with you? What about your job? Don't you have to get back to the market? I'm all through for the day. Won't your folks wonder where you are? Oh them! It's just my big sister and she don't care. I just live at a ??? ??? Bobby, will you get Smitty's dish. It's right there on the floor. Oh sure. There you are, Smitty. Here Smitty. Do you think he's okay? >> Sure, he'll be alright. I found a little bird once. He fell out of his nest. He wouldn't eat so he died. He was a real tiny bird. He didn't even have no feathers on him yet. A good place you got here. Who sleeps here? Nancy. My little girl. >> Where's she? In Chicago. She's in a hospital there. What's the matter with her? >> She was in a car accident. When will she be back? >> I don't know Bobby. Soon I hope. This is a real baseball, isn't it? Yeah, I caught in a game last summer. It's Smitty's now. Here Smitty! >> Don't make him chase it. No, I won't. You like baseball, huh? Sure. I go down to the television store on the corner to watch the games. But it isn't like the real thing. Well, maybe some day I'll take you to a game. Would you? I got a friend who'll get us in free. There's a swell game tonight. I couldn't go tonight Bobby. I'm sorry. Why? Well, to tell you the truth, I'm pretty worried about my little girl. I've got to get a few things straightened out today. You broke? How'd you guess? Well, my sister's broke, so I said she's got to get things straightened out. Listen, if you need money, I can get it for you. That's nice of you Bobby ... but I need quite a bit. I've got 57 dollars and 75 cents saved up. I told you I've been working at the market. You have? Wow. I don't think your sister would like you to give your money away to strangers Bobby. But you're no stranger. Anyhow, she don't care. She just wants to get married to Arthur. That's all she thinks about. You going to live with them? Hmm? No, I want to live in Claremont. Relatives? No. Just some people who take in kids. You know. You going to stay there for good? >> Hmm. I don't know. Didn't your sister tell you? >> She never tells me nothing. Maybe you'd better hold on to your savings Bobby. I trust you. You mean that? >> What? That you trust me? >> Sure. I don't need the money now. Come on, let's go to my place. I'll get it for you. I don't know, Bobby. Why not? The money's no good to anybody rattling around in that old bag. Come on! Let's go. Bobby, I never thought you'd be the one to help me out. Ha! You didn't know I was loaded, did you. This is where I live. I'd better wait here. >> Oh, come on in. Sis will ball me out because I'm late. But she won't do it if you're with me. Come on. That's my room down there. Bobby, is that you? >> Yeah. Come in here. I'm going to my room. >> I want you to come in here! Yeah, what do you want? >> Come here. Now. Didn't I tell you to come straight home from the market .. .. so you could take that dress over to Mrs. Snyder? I hit a little dog with my bike so I had to take care of him. You've always got an excuse. That's the truth. >> Now don't do that! Don't hit me! Now get in the kitchen and clean up that mess you left this morning. Then I want that box delivered over there. I'll do it later. >> I want you to do it right now! I can't. Bill's out there. Who? The guy who owns the dog. You know. Oh, Bobby. I want to show him something. Hello. >> Hello. My name is Cannon. >> I'm Bobby's sister. What seems to be the trouble? Bobby tells me he ran over your dog. Well, he just nicked him a little bit. It was nothing. I told you not to ride your bicycle like a wild Indian. It wasn't his fault. >> Come on Bill. Now where are you going? >> I want to show Bill my baseball things. Oh, Art's taking a nap in your room. Art is my fianc?. He just drove down from Fresno. We'll be real quiet. Come on Bill. You won't let him make any noise, will you. >> No I won't. Now Bobby don't take too much time. Remember you've got to make a delivery. Okay. I can't find it. Maybe your sister put it some place else? It's always been in here. It wouldn't be in there. No. Come on. I'll ask Sis. What are you going to say? I'll say I want to show you my savings bank. That's all. Hey Sis! Where's my savings bank? Hey Sis, what happened to my savings bank? It isn't in the drawer any more. >> I know it isn't. Where is it? >> I put it away. Can I have it? Nope. >>Why not? Because you keep taking it out of the house all the time. And I don't want you to lose it. I've put it away and it's going to stay there. I want to show it to Bill. I'm sure he's seen a savings bank before. I want to show it to him anyway. >> Well you won't. It's my bank and I can with it what I please! Bobby! Get down off of that couch right this minute! Or you go to bed. I can't do anything about you taking my bank .. Bobby! Come back here. You'll see how far you get in Claremont acting like that. What he needs is a good spanking. Oh, I don't think that's what he really needs. That's easy for you to say. But I've been saddled with him since I was sixteen. At his age, most boys are a little difficult. Well, how would you like the job of bringing him up? I wouldn't mind. Well you just let me know whenever you want him, and he's yours for keeps. Bobby, where are you going? >> Outside! Well, come back here and get the box. I'm going out in a little while. I ... will. See what I mean? Well ... I'd better be going. Will you send him back? >> Sure. Goodbye. >> Glad to have met you. Bill! >> Go on home, Bobby. Bill? >> Yeah? I got it. >> Got what? The money. >> What money? Remember the roll that was lying on the bed? Bobby ... you stole that? I didn't steal it. I just borrowed it. >> Go and put it back. Put it back! I can't now. Art was just waking up. He almost caught me. Please go and put it back. You won't have time to get any money any other place. But I'm not going to use this. Just take what you need. I'll go back and find my bank. And then I'll take my money and put it with his. I'll hide the whole roll under the bed so Art can find it later. He won't even know the difference. But I need fifty dollars. Are you sure you've got that much? I told you. I've even got more. If I could only be sure you'd find your bank. Let me see how much there is in that roll. Too late mister. We're closed for the day. But I've got to pay my bill. >> Sorry. We're closed. >> Take your hands off me! What's the matter with you, anyway? >> I told you. I've got to pay my bill. And I told you we're closed. Come back tomorrow morning at eight-thirty. But .. Maybe there will still be time tomorrow morning. Go home, Bobby. Why do I have to go now? >> Go home! I'm not going to drag you around with me all night. What did I do? Nothing, nothing. Just, leave me alone. Bobby. I'm sorry Bobby, I didn't mean to yell at you. It's just that everything has gone wrong. You understand don't you? ... Huh? Well ... what do you want to do? You hungry? >> Oh, I could eat a hamburger. Bill, you know that friend of yours you were talking about? What friend? The one who always gets you into the baseball park free. What about him? >> Maybe he can get us into a game? There's a good one on tonight. >> You wouldn't get home until eleven. Sis never gets home until real late when Art's in town. If I get us in ... will you promise to go straight home afterwards? I promise. Honest Bill. Alright. Come on. Let's try it. >> Oh boy! Yes! Go! Run! run! run! Run! Run! What you say, mister? How about a cap for the kid, huh? Gee, they're neat. >> How much are they? Half a buck. Okay. Give him one. Perfect fit! Thank you. Here you are folks! Get your autographed bats and baseball caps. Come on! Run! run! run! Gee, it sure was a swell game. Thanks for taking me. That's okay, but you're going home now, remember? Bill! The money! >> What about it? It's gone! >> Gone? Come on. Which pocket did you have it in? >> This one. Well, look in there again. Hurry up. What about this pocket? No. >> Is it in there? In the back pocket? This one over here? >> No. No it's not in this one. Oh I lost it. >> How could you have lost it? I don't know. Up in the grandstands? Maybe I pulled it out with my handkerchief. Come on! That's where we sat. Up there. Alright. There's where we sat. >> Are you sure? Yes. >> Alright. Now look around carefully. Is is down there? >> No. Look under that paper. Lose something? >> Yeah, a roll of money. Ever find four-leaf clover? >> No. Neither have I. Here. Look under that crack Bobby. Right down there. No. Somebody must have found it. Thanks. I'm sure sorry, Bill. Why don't you report to "Lost and Found". Bottom of those stairs. Okay. Come on Bobby. Pardon me. Could I speak to you a minute? I uh, lost quite a bit of money up in the grandstand. Can I leave me name, just in case? >> How much was it? I don't know exactly. I know it was more than a hundred. Was it in a wallet? >> No. In a gold clip. Was there an initial on it or anything to identify it? Yeah, it had a, you know, a dollar sign on it. Was this it? Yeah, that's it. >> Gee, somebody found it. Want to count it? No, I don't want to count it. >> A lady found it, laying in the aisle. You know the lady's name? >> No, she didn't say. Thanks ... thanks a lot. Guess you must live right. We've got to go home and go to bed now Bobby. Bobby. Bobby. Bobby. Who is it? >> It's me, Bill. What did you come back for? >> Did your sister come home, yet? Huh? >> Your sister? Did she come home yet? Uh, I don't know. I sleep here. Let me in Bobby. I want to talk to you. >> The back door. Ouch! What's the matter? >> Where'd you put the money? Right there. Under the bed. You know, after you left I looked everywhere for my bank, but I still couldn't find it. Don't worry about it anymore. Aren't you going to keep that money? No. >> Why not? Bobby, listen to me. I want you tell me the truth. Have you ever stolen anything before? >> Never. Honest. I didn't think you had. And you must never again. Never! Promise? I promise. Bobby, I came back because I couldn't let you slip the money under the bed. And lie to them about what happened. I'll return it myself. And I'm going to keep you out of this. >> You'll get in trouble. Art's awful mean I have to take that chance. Art won't even listen to you. Please don't wait for him. Bobby, I've got to wait for him. We've done something wrong. I know you took the money to help me, but it's wrong to steal. Even if you mean well. When you steal, you lie afterwards. And once you lie to people, it's only one step more until you start lying to yourself. You make excuses to yourself for everything you do. And soon, you'll believe your own excuses. I've done it myself Bobby. I know. I never want to do it again. Remember what the guy at the ballpark said to us? He said "you must live right". Well .. I never did. I don't ever want you to have to say that. Now ... go to sleep. Bill, where are you going? >> In the living room. To wait for your sister and Art. Bill. >> What Bobby? I'm scared. You don't have to be scared any more. Just go to sleep now. Would you give me a goodnight hug? Don't tuck me in at the bottom. You sound just like Nancy. Gee, I sure wish I had you for a dad. Sleep tight Bobby. Goodnight Bill. >> Goodnight son. I'll be in the next room. [ phone rings ] [ phone rings ] Long distance? How much is a call to Chicago? Station to station. Alright.

Yes, operator. Police department? I'm trying to get some information about a car accident that happened yesterday. And I believe .. [ door bangs ] Here he is, Babs. It's about my little daughter, Nancy Cannon. C-AN-N-O-N. And here's the guy that stole my dough. Yesterday! That's why I'm calling you now in Chicago. What's he doing on that phone? Calling Chicago. >> Well, of all the nerve. Put that down! He's trying to phone a hospital. Get off the phone! Where's my dough, huh? >> I've got it right here. I brought it back. >> I told you he stole it. He didn't steal it. I stole it. Where do you live? What do you want from me now? We brought it back! Where do you live? Don't hit him! 411 and a half west third. Shall we call the cops again? Don't call the cops! We didn't keep any of your money. You rotten little thief. >> Don't take it out on him. He knows it was wrong. He'll never do it again. ???? ???? ????? Pardon me mister. I'm looking for a job. I'll do anything. Anything you say. Just put me to work. Get going, will you. >> Listen to me. Please listen to me a minute. I'm in a jam. The worst jam I've ever been in all my life. There's only one way to get out of it. I've got to make some money. What's the hurry? >> You got any kids? Two. >> I got one. She's in Chicago. Tomorrow morning she comes off the operating table .. .. and I don't even know what hospital she's in. I got to make enough money to call Chicago. The Police. They know how to find people. Please give me a job so I can make that call. Got any experience? >> I got two arms. I could work one of those drills. You got any idea what one of them babies will do to you? Don't worry about that. >> You couldn't last five minutes. If I last ten, would you put me to work? Pull her out Joe. Let him take it for a minute. Go ahead. She's all yours. Alright. Now, you've had your chance. >> Give me another chance! Please mister, I know I can do it. Okay, go ahead. Here ... take it Joe. I'll give you a job you can handle. Alright fellows, get back to work. Grab one of them shovels over there. Cannon. Thanks for the break. >> Forget it. I bet that's the first time he ever handled a shovel. I didn't see him lean on it. [ dog barking ] Now you keep still Smitty ... he'll be here in a little while. If you're quiet, I'll take you for a nice, long walk. [ dog barking ] He isn't in. >> When's he coming back? I don't know. Is there something you want me to tell him? Yep ... tell him the telephone man was here, and I'll be back later. You going to turn on his phone? >> No. I'm going to take it out. Don't do that! Don't take his telephone away. Well, it's no good to him any more. The line's dead. He's been trying to raise the money. I know because I was with him all afternoon yesterday. His wife going to call him about his little girl. Yeah, he told me. If you take his telephone away, he won't know how sick she is. Oh, she's probably alright. But he's got to know for sure, don't you understand? He's got to know for sure, or he'll go crazy. Look, you just tell him I was here, and I'll be back pretty soon, will you. Please do something mister. Please .. go away. Please, please. Bobby! In here Bobby. In here! Bill! No, operator, I haven't finished yet. I'm glad I've found you. >> Shhhh. Yes, I'm right here. We've checked with the traffic department, and also with the emergency hospital. There's been no accident reported involving any child by that name. But look. It says right here in the wire. Nancy seriously injured in car accident outside Chicago. Well "outside Chicago". That's something else again. That covers a lot of territory. She isn't right here in the city. It will take more time to locate her. That's hard to say. Maybe you'd better call me back later in the day. No, that's no good! Keep trying please. I'll hang on. Okay ... it's your money. Sergeant Novak. What did you say, Bobby? The cops were over at our house last night. Art gave them your address. Don't go home Bill. They'll put you in jail if they catch you. How much? Okay. But operator, I just put in seventy cents. [ police siren ] Hello! What's that? Operator, hello! Hello! Can you hear me? [ police siren ] Operator! Hello! Hello! Hello. [ dog barking ] Hello Smitty. I forgot to tell you the telephone man was here. What did he want? The phone? Yeah. He said he'd be back in a little while. [ phone rings ] What was that? [ phone rings ] The phone! The phone! Come on, quick! Hello. Hello. Yes, this is him. Who? ... Jim who? ... the telephone man? I kept in touch with the office all day yesterday. What happened to you? I thought you were going to settle up that bill. I couldn't raise the money. They wouldn't give you an extension, huh? Tough. Maybe you've been talking to the wrong people. Well, we'd better cut the gab. Your call ought to be coming through pretty quick now. On the house. Don't forget, I'll be back at noon to get the black box. No fooling this time. You're the closest thing to an angel I've ever seen. An angel with a screwdriver? >> Thanks pal. Thank your pal. He talked me into it. I think he ought to make a great lawyer some day. Well, good luck. Hey! Down there! Friends of yours? They're cops. And they're coming in ... yeah, pretty sure they're coming in. You'd better hide. I'll try to get rid of them. William Cannon? >> That's right. Mr. Cannon, we're taking you down to the station. You know why don't you? Yes, I know, but I didn't keep the money. We wouldn't know about that. We've got a warrant for your arrest. I can't leave now. My wife's going to call me any minute from Chicago. It's about my kid. It's the truth mister. He's telling you the truth. I gave all the money back. Honest, mister. Who's the boy? >> Miss Kimble's brother. Please keep him out of it. We'll see when we get down to the station. Let's go Cannon. >> Can't you wait another 10-15 minutes? You don't know what I've been through to get this call. Are you going to come peacefully or do we have to take you? Alright. I took the money. Honest, mister. He didn't take it. Please let him talk to her .. Alright. Let's go Cannon. [ phone rings ] That's my wife now. >> Wait a minute! Let him go! Let him talk to her! Hello? Hello? Chicago? Yes, this is Mr. Cannon. Yes Mary. This is Bill. Yes darling. Go ahead. Mary? Mary, you're crying. Why are you crying? I can't hear you Mary. What? Nancy? Oh ... oh no. No ... no. It can't be ... it can't be. Oh. Oh God, it isn't true. I can't be. Where are you now? Where can I phone you? I'll call you back, Mary. In a little while ... I can't think now. I can't think. Bill. I'll be right down. [ phone rings ] Hello? Yes. Yes operator. He completed his call. Cigarette? Cannon ... we're not going to take you in. I just talked to headquarters. I think maybe we can straighten this thing out. At least that's one break for you. Bill, where are you going? Won't you talk to me, Bill? Bill, please talk to me. Bill, please talk to me. Please Bill. Bill please .. Look out Bill! Look out! Bill! Let go of me. What's the matter? You drunk? Let go of me! Bill! Bill! Bill! Wait for me. Bill! Let me go! Let me go! He'll kill himself! What are you talking about? Who killed himself? He's trying to kill .. Bill. Bill! ... Oh Bill. This kid almost got run over trying to get to you. He said you're going to kill yourself. I'm not going to kill myself Bobby. And you'll never have to worry about me again. Is he your son? He's my son. Subs for KG by "Targa".
