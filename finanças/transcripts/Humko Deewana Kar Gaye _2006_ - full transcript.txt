IJust love traditional marriage. I don't think so. I think it is a waste of time... ...money and energy. It is we who are getting married. Then why are we calling our friends and relatives and feeding them? One must be practical in life. I don't care for traditions. Everybody has his own opinion. Yes. Are you tired? - Not much. So... - So? Shall I leave? - Ok. Give me a kiss. - What!? Give me a goodnight kiss. Is this some time for a kiss? There isn't a time for a kiss. One has to be in the mood for it. You have to be romantic. Give me a kiss. Aditya, someone might see. Who is going to see us at 3.30 am? And I've got the license too. We Just got engaged... you are my fianc?e. Please give me a kiss. Just grow up! Why... grown ups don't take kisses? Tanya. Sonia, why don't you give Aditya what he asked? If you can't do it, I will do it. Daddy too is ready in the room. And he said that mom is ready too. And for God's sake tell him to take the hand... ...off the speaker phone. It is 3.30 am in the morning. Ridiculous that you are fighting over a kiss. C'mon give him a kiss. Don't know... they are engaged and then too for a kiss... Good night. - Good night. Are we engaged? - What do you mean? Are we really engaged? Grow up, Adi. What are you saying? I can't really believe this. We are really engaged. O madam, please convince him you are engaged. Till he is not convinced, he will not let anyone sleep. Can't believe! - Go to sleep. Gavin -Yeah! What kind of smell is this? Stinking! Excuse me please. - Yes sir. What kind of smell is this? I will check out. It is really stinking. It must surely be some Indian. - What happened? They should know. These days everything is available... ...everywhere but they still move around with shop loads. Disgusting! - Disgusting! Excuse me, sir. Is this your bag? How happy would your sister be that you are going to Canada! Am I going to take all this luggage? You aren't going to carry it on your head. You are going by plane. I won't take it. Take it without saying a word. It is our love. Add a few more kilos of love! These children! How cute are they when they cry! But they don't like us sleeping. I can't understand at all... ...why these people travel with such little children. As if you would leave your kids behind! Of course! Since we are talking about it, we should make it clear. I think we shouldn't think about kids for 5-6 years after marriage. This is the time for our careers. And I don't think we are ready for kids. At least I'm not. Sonia. - Yes. Sonia, this is the passport and ticket. - Ok. And call up Simran when you reach Paris. Ok, I'll do it. - Ok. But you don't forget your workouts. I hate unfit people and this T-Shirt looks cool on you. I'll get you some more. - Ok, thank you. Ok, I'll leave then. And listen... Have a safe flight and take care. I'll do that. Bye! You too take care, Aditya. Uncle! - Hey Dumpy. What is this, uncle? I sent you six emails. You didn't reply even to one. I was busy with my female and couldn't respond to your email. Ok, sorry. Come soon. - There they are. Adi! - Uncle! - Hey! You are looking so young. Wait! Wait! - My God I was scared! How weak he has become, isn't it Raabi! True! Raabi has become really weak. Weak... thank you. Did you hear? I've become weak. Very funny. How is Sonia? They all look good before marriage. Correct! - Right! Absolutely right. Correct? - No... wrong! Absolutely wrong! I mean Adi is wrong. My brother is wrong? That's me. - Yeah. My luggage. - Ok. Both you brother and sister are right. I am wrong. No need to explain to me. - Listen to me. Stop fighting. How dare you touch my luggage! - Sister. - This is my luggage. Leave it to me, Adi. I know how to deal with these people. Sister, he is from my company. - I will call the police. Sister, he is from my company. What are you doing? You are hitting him. What will he think? He's come to pick me. He came to pick you? Then who did we come here for? You've indeed come for me. But he is from my company. He came to pick me up. They've booked an apartment for me. I am in contract with them. Why don't you understand? Why don't you explain it to her? He is right. I know he is right. - Then what was the need to come here? You could have got trained in Mumbai! Sister, do you think that I like staying away from you? - Huh! I will come over in the weekends. Every Sunday. We will enjoy ourselves. We will go for picnics. We will go for lunches and parties... everything. C'mon sis... c'mon! Try to understand, please. Hey man, why are you staring at me? Take all this stuff. - What did you say? Take the luggage and take him also. - Ok, c'mon. I'll meet you overthe weekend. Mom sent pickle foryou. I'll get that too. - It's ok. So you seem like quite a family man. Ya, unfortunately I've to stay alone. No... you have a roommate. - A roommate!? Welcome... I am Nawab Sharif. I am a gentleman only by name and not by actions. I am from Pakistan. Any problems? Aditya Malhotra. - Great! Nice meeting you. - I too feel great to meet you. Welcome Aditya, welcome to Canada. Thank you, sir. - Let me show you. - Sure, sir. You know we have the biggest dealership in Canada. Look at our showroom. The best showroom ever in Canada. Aditya, you want to test drive? Let's go ahead. Take it easy. Come on Nawab! Oh boy! Aditya, you drive well. - Thank you. Buddy, was this a test drive or were you taking revenge... ...against me forthe Kargil war? Adi! You know what I was thinking? - Sir! Why don't you represent us in cross country rally? I would love to do that, sir. - O beautiful! Hang on. - Oh! Sorry. If you take your hand off the button... the lift will move. - Sorry! - Its alright. Linda! - Daddy! Oh! FBI has done its Job. Right... right... - No, left... left... Are you going out? - No, why? Then why are you looking like a Christmas tree? Adi! Eat the snacks. Mom, what are you doing? - It is Nawab's peg. I know that it is liquor. It is not a milk drinking age. Kitty, aunty cannot hear well. But granny can see quite well. Mama! I am gone. It is the last chance to save the princess. - Excuse me. How does this start? It is paused. If you take your hand off the button it will play. 'if you take your hand off the button... the lift will move. - Sorry! ' Left... left... Right... right... Yes, yes, I am trying to save it. Yeah. Thank you. Oh, my cake! - What? I am really sorry. I didn't realise I was Just walking... ...and I will Just clean it up. What are you doing? It's okay. I am really sorry. My apartment is there. You can clean up the mess there. Come! No, its okay. Thank you. I'll manage. Are you sure? - Yeah! - Are you sure? Hey! Nice dress! Get it from the bakery shop. Sorry, it is all because of me. My offer is still open... please! You look beautiful! It is good that you accepted my advice. Those children made a cake shop of you. Will you have cream biscuits? No, I am getting late. I've got to be leaving. Will you drink something? - No. Coke? - No! Orange Juice? - No! Tomato Juice? - This is tomato ketchup. Why do you always say no? - Nothing like that. You Just said no. Your cake fell down because of me. And I was thinking that your clothes got spoilt because of me. You reduced my guilt by saying that. Why feel guilty? It was an accident. I don't think so. I think that whatever happens is all a master plan. It's all destiny. What do you think? No. Suppose that you get run over by a bus tomorrow. Ya... thanks why not? I said suppose... it will be because you weren't watchful. It would not be because of a master plan. So you mean to say that your coming to this apartment is not destiny? Right? No. It is because we both took our eyes off the path. That's why we bumped into each other. But we both taking our eyes off and that too at this time... Don't you think so? That's destiny. May be! Anyway thanks for everything. I must be going now. Okay. - Bye! Are you sure you don't want to drink? - No. Thank you. Bye! O my God! I am sorry. The door was actually open. I left my bag. Never mind. Go and take your bag. Are you okay? - Absolutely! Go! Your nose? - Destiny! Go! - Really sorry. Take this. What is this for? Oh, thank you. Take care of yourself. She's back. -What brother? Wow! Yes, I got the message. Actually I was busy. Never mind! At least we are now talking. I am trying to be busy. Shopping is so boring sometimes. Thank God! I can never handle shopping. I'm overloaded with work. Some people are so lucky. They avoid all their duties in the name of work. Excuse me, I am not giving any excuse. Actually I was very busy. I don't know how truthful you are. But your sister is waiting here with a sword in hand. What are you saying!? - Ho... ho... well! You fool, where are you speaking from? I am speaking from my mouth. Very funny! I was cooking your favourites since three days. Come soon or I'll never talk to you in this life. So you are now threatening me. I don't know why I don't get such threats. Very funny! It's not funny any more, Jennifer. You don't understand. Shopping alone like this... and Karan is just not bothered. C'mon Jia! Don't sound so low. Is there any girl in this world... ...who is bored of shopping? And that too when she is shopping for her marriage. - Excuse me, please sign this. I tell you what let's change places. I'll do the shopping foryou and you become the PAto Karan. At least you'll get closerto yourfianc?e. What do you say? - Oh, yeah! Okay... take care. - You too. Oh, I am sorry. - Its okay. Oops! - Sorry... I... You? Twice! I think we should learn to shake hands. Aditya Malhotra! - Jia... Jia Yashvardhan! What a unique name! Jia... Jia Yashvardhan! Very nice! Not twice. Just Jia. It's ok. Thanks. Let me help you. - No... really it's fine. There must be some punishment for bumping in. Tell me one thing. Whenever I meet you why do you carry... ...so many bags? Do you do smuggling? No! Shopping! I mean what do you do besides shopping? I Just keep shopping on various pretexts. Oh, nice Job! And you. And what do you do? Are you asking me what I do besides bumping into you? Do you never get serious? I would be in a hospital if I became serious. But not going around with you in a mall. I like your smile. - Thanks. You didn't tell me what you do. I work hard. I help people. I bump into them, pick up their bags... ...and drop them to their vehicles. That's my Job. Please pick up our bags too. Ghuggi... Ghuggi... I am coming. How are you? - I am fine. What are you doing here? - I am getting trained. Do you need training even for this Job? Didn't you get trained in college? Greetings! - Greetings! We are not friends Just from happy days. We are friends even before that. Sis-in-law! - Sis-in-law? You used to have a girl friend at college. What's her name? Pammi! - Yes, Pammi! He had a girl friend in college. What happened to her? Now she is not my girl friend. Thank God! You are lucky that she is not your girl friend. What do you mean? Except you and a few other guys... ...she had affairs with everyone else in college. She is... She is my wife now. She is beautiful... she is nice... she was very good... she was... Excuse me! - Ghuggi! Ghuggi! You should not have spoken like that. I was just Joking. Unnecessarily he got angry. But the matter became serious. Aditya! ParamJeet? Yes, ParamJeet... Pammi! What do you think of yourself? Just shooting off your mouth! When did you see me roaming with other guys? Sis-in-law! - Sis-in-law!? Now you are giving me respect. What happened to all that when you maligned me... ...in front of Sardar-Ji? Sis-in-law! I was Just Joking. It takes just a minute to break a relation. But takes a life time building them. And you... Where has Sardar-Ji gone? Sardar-Ji! I am sorry, sister. I lost my brother. I am sorry, brother, I lost my husband. We are moments away from starting. Can I have the mike? I have to say few words. Please, sir. Please! Stop her! Hey stop! Okay. - No! No! Listen to me! Listen to me! Hey! I know this lady. Where are you? Please, my dear! Don't do this to me. Otherwise... otherwise I swear by you... I will kill myself. Where are you? I say, where are you? Sorry ladies and gentleman for interrupting your evening. Today this lady who is standing beside me... ...needs your help to reassure her husband... ...what the meaning of true love is! It's because of my ignorance I caused her husband... ...to suspect, doubt and question his wife. I know that you are listening to me. You are so fortunate that you have got such a loving wife. But you are unlucky that you don't have faith in her love. How can anyone listen to stray words and doubt his love? There is no room for doubt in love. Where there is love there should only be love. Only love! You too cannot remain happy entertaining such doubt. If anyone of you find him around please make him understand. That it is not worth breaking the relationship for such small things. This is his photograph. Please, cameraman! Can you zoom on it? Okay. - Okay. Please, I beg all of you to spread the magic of love everywhere. Whatever I said earlier was a Joke. But whatever I said now is the truth. That is the only truth. Pammi! Pammi! You are one and I am one. And we have God's blessings on us. We both should embrace each othertightly. And the one who releases the embrace first will be a deceiver. Thank God, both of them united again. 'There is no room for doubt in love.' 'Where there is love there should only be love. Only love! ' Hello! - Hello, Jia! How are you? Jenny! Where is Karan? He is in meeting as usual. It's a big business deal. How romantic! Oh, come on Jia! Just think from his side. He wants to buy all the happiness in this world foryou. Happiness cannot be bought, Jenny. He promised me to come with me to shop forthe marriage. You know... that he never bought anything else... ...except factories and shares? I know. Karan loves you a lot, Jia. But the problem is he doesn't know how to express it. Anyway, tell me what shopping you did today. I bought a book for Karan. 40 Landscapes... Sports cars? 40 Landscapes. Wow! UTV "Destroyed! This heart is destroyed." "Destroyed!

I say, have some more. - What are you doing? Not a cool drink, get me some wine. No! No, we are not allowed to serve. Raabi! Come on, don't be embarrassed. Its okay. Hi, everybody! Hello! - Hi. Why is everyone looking at me like that? It is not their mistake. I think they hate me. I won't let it happen. Why are you looking like that? She is my friend. Can't I bring my friend to a party? She is Jia... Jia... Jia Yashvardhan. - Yes! Yes! She is my sister. She is always angry. IJust came along to wish Dumpy on his birthday. You don't mind. No! No! Not at all... not at all... Look, mom... What Jia got for me... Isn't it cool? Thank you so much... so sweet! Welcome... welcome... Thank you. - Thank you. Here comes your guest. They may be your guests. Not ours. Why do you get angry? Okay, sister. I am sorry for being late. We are late because she spent time in make-up. Make-up!? I mean, explain it to her. She always gets angry. That is her way of showing love. Stop it. It is enough. Love can never be enough. - The Rakhi festival is about to come. So, I think she needs a lump sum amount. Adi, you too. Oh! I don't get it even if I ask. Never mind! Get the Rakhi tied and you too will get it. Rabbi... what a nice song... Jia, give me that curry. - Yes. Excuse me. Where are you going? - We are Just going to the wash room. Come on soon before the work is done. Raabi! - What, mom? How come all three guys want to shit together? He brought us to some party. Hi, Pammi! She was in such a good mood. She said that we should stay in a hotel. I was a fool to reject such a hot offerfrom my wife... ...and come to this cold party. No, buddy! You got an offerfrom your wife. But I left an offer from another's wife. Here there is neither liquor nor beautiful women. Do something. What can I do? All of them are bro-in-law's friends. They are all behaving like English men. I'll teach a lesson to these English men. One minute! One minute! Now it will be interesting. What are you doing, will you drink? This is English stuff. If everyone consumes it a little... ...the true nature will come out. You fool! Everyone drinks Juice. - Take it. This is the age of adulteration. We'll mix it a little in the Juice and no one will come to know. What a good plan! We have the same ideas on both sides of the border. Oh my gosh! My leg! My son has a hotel at the top of the restaurant. Shall I have the room opened? Aunty! We were discussing... you misunderstood us. Were you kissing? Not kissing, aunty. We were discussing. There is a conference hall too above. Go and discuss there. Oh, my... disgusting people... Aunty! You misunderstood us. Now we will mix in all the drinks. Get the bottle. What are you doing? Drink it and see. - How much will you make me drink? C'mon darling! It is plain Juice. Give it to mom also. No. This is sweet and she will get sugar complaint. Nothing will happen in one glass. Give it. As you wish. The Juice is okay foryou, mom. It is not wine. Take it. One more. No. You have diabetes... please... Is this Juice your daddy's? No, it is orange Juice. What will I lose? Wait... one more. One more. - Excuse me. UTV "What a watch out! C'mon! C'mon!" "Taste it! Taste it!" "Hit the floor. Yeah! Come on, burn the floor." "It's the time. Come on, close the door."

You can kiss, isn't it? - Yes! That's it! I didn't feel bad at all. Don't be embarrassed. Stop, I am not embarrassed. Rather I am happy that you speak Punjabi so well. You fitted so well in the family. By the way where did you learn Punjabi? My mothertongue is Punjabi. - No way. Yashvardhan are Punjabis. I would not have guessed that. Dumpy is very cute. He loves you a lot. You too. Thanks for being so nice to him. It is I who has to thank. Only today I learnt what relations are and what family is. I have laughed so much that my eyes are filled with tears. Your hotel has come. Come on, what happened? Nothing! You know, Aditya... what is the most beautiful moment... ...in my day? - What is it? When I come to meet you. And do you know what the worst moment in my day is? It is when I go away after meeting you. But why do these moments come together? I don't understand. I'll leave. Give me a ring. - What? Give me a ring. - Ring!? On phone! - Okay. Call me. - Take care! You take care too. I'll take care of my thoughts too. Hi, best of luck. Yes, I desperately need that. Where is Nawab? - Overthere. What happened to him? Nothing! I warned him last night not to over eat. But he didn't listen to me. Now he has loose motions. He is going to the toilet repeatedly. I don't know what to do. What will happen now? Nothing. We lost the race even before it started. I don't have a navigator. I'll go and tell those people that I don't have a navigator... ...and so I can't participate. 1, 2, 3, 4, Aditya! - What happened? I can try. Can you clean the car? - I can try. I think your luck is working. Are you okay? - Yeah! Nice parking. Sorry, I dozed off. What will happen now? Nothing! Now we have to wait till morning. What else? Till morning? - Yes. What will we do till morning? You sleep here and I here. Because these doors won't open now. We are covered with snow all over. We'll go to sleep. What else? Good night. I can't sleep. You know I used to have the same problem in childhood. I would not get to sleep. Then my mother would say that if you can't sleep... ...then you must think of such a place where you want to go. And close your eyes. Gradually you'll get to sleep. Yeah, believe me. I am telling you the truth. Some times I used to think and go into space. It is amazing. Oh, that's not possible. It is. I am telling you. It's a fact. You don't believe me? Okay, let us try once and see. Close your eyes. We'll... try... come on... Stop looking here... come on... come on... Close your eyes. Jia, where are you? Rome, Spanish steps... It's so beautiful. Where are you? In the heaven of Kashmir... Iovely. I always wanted to see Kashmir. Hold my hands and see how tall the mountains are. How does it feel from here? What happened? I am scared of heights. See, Jia. Only after reaching heights in life can we see new paths. And by travelling on those paths we can attain new goals. What about the relations that we kept all along? In life some relationships exist which we know... ...but don't want to tell ourselves. But the heart inside understands everything. It knows everything. The heart shows dreams which can never become true. The distance between dreams and reality is the wink of an eye. It is a dream when the eye is closed and... ...reality when it is open. It is not so easy, Aditya. Why not? Come on, dare to dream. I am scared that I'll get lost. I'll see that you won't get lost. Trust me. Give me your hand. Now close your eyes and see that your dreams are waiting foryou. UTV "You fill my breath and my heart beat." "You fill my eyes and my life." "You mesmerize me."

You girls have strange ways! You said five minutes but took forty. Actually I... Who is there, honey? - Karan... it is... Yes? - Actually it is... - Room service, sir. Your hotel knows that I'm not to be disturbed. Actually I called him. Your uniform? Sir, it was the last call of the shift. I already changed my clothes. I am sorry about that, sir. That's being very unprofessional. You know I can get you sacked forthat. Sorry sir. - Anyway clean the mess. - Sure. It's ok. I think it can be done later. That's his Job, honey. Let him do it. Excuse me waiter. - Yes sir. That's a tip foryou and next time come in uniform. Ok? I will be careful, sir. Honey, I forgot to ask you. How was your shopping? - Okay, not bad. Welcome, Mr. Oberoi. - Hello. How are you sir? Always the best. You want a picture? Gentlemen, he is the son of my friend. He has grown up in front of me. Afterthe unfortunate death of Mr. And Mrs. Oberoi... ...the way he managed the business... ...it's amazing! Mr. Oberoi, your marriage and this proJect... won't there be a clash? It's a merger it is not a clash. You know each other for quite some time... ...what do you like about Karan? Jia, cut the list short. Mr. Oberoi how do you classify your marriage, love or arranged? Of course love! I love her and she loves me. Karan, please! - Why? What happened? I don't like doing it forthe photos. Look honey, I am Karan Oberoi. Whatever I do, they're bound to take pictures. Sorry to interrupt you, sir. But they are waiting for you inside. - Ok, come. Good evening sir. - Hello. - Good evening. Good evening. - Good evening. Here he is. Welcome, my son. Meet Mr. Wilson. Mr. Gupta. Mr. Thapar. - Good evening, Mr. Thapar. How are you? And Mr. Mittal. Congratulations, Mr. Oberoi. You are getting married to Yashvardhan. You've taken overthe steel industry. You must be a happy man. You have everything, man. Everything... one takeover is still left. What? - Your company. I am sorry. You must be Joking. I'm serious. I'm serious. C'mon let's go. - I am very serious. I am Just observing that Karan is not marrying me. He is Just doing a take-over. It is betterthat you make it a habit. Your Pizza, sir. Aah... thank God you are here. I am very hungry. - Me too. EnJoy guys! - Thank you! Won't you say anything? I am thinking about what to say. Won't you ask me to come in? Sorry! Please come in. Thank you. I like this anger of yours. Actually what happened that day is... That is past. You are completely wet. Why don't you go and change? Okay. Thank you. This is yours. Why isn't everyone like you, Aditya? You understand everything without me saying anything. Silence is also strange. If it enters a relationship then it turns into suffocation. Coffee? - Thank you! My father used to talk to everyone except to my mother. Dad had only a physical relation with my mother. He used to beat her and she bore it all silently. Mom used to love dad a lot. People say that love can change anyone. But it couldn't change my dad. Even today people think that my mom committed suicide. But I know that dad's silence killed her. My father killed her. His indifference killed her. The weather outside is very bad. It is betterthat you stay here tonight. It is said that the sunlight after a rain will be beautiful. Do you like coffee cold? - No. Then drink it hot. Cheers! Who is it? - There is a girl in the room upstairs. Don't you think you must do something? Nawab! She is very worried. I know that. You can make herforget her worries. It cannot be done by sleeping here. You have to go upstairs. Shut up! Go and sleep, Nawab. Please go upstairs, buddy. Please go. It is very late in the night, Nawab. I am telling you. Please think again. I don't want to speak to you. Oh, sorry. No! No, Jia! I didn't say that to you. Out! No! Not you. I am telling that to Nawab. There he goes behind you. I couldn't sleep. That is why... I too couldn't sleep. That is why I am watching the movie. Which movie is this? Junglee! Hey, Shammi Kapoor! - He is my favourite. 'That means you love someone.' 'Do you know when you love someone... ...the confusion in your heart will increase.' 'You cannot understand my feelings.' 'I love you a lot! I love you a lot.' How easily they said 'I love you.' Popcorn? I wish it was so easy. - I wish it was so easy. "Alas! What should I do?" I love this song. IJust love the way he dances in this. Shammi Kapoor man, he's God. I wish I could dance like him. Then we can try. It shouldn't be difficult. Come on, let's try. - No! No! It will be fun. It will be really fun. Come on! Come on, get up. "Alas! What should I do?" The DVD got stuck. - Yes. I will forward it. It would have been nice if we could forward life too. Then the fun of living will go away. But we can know which relationships last life long... ...and which are short-lived. Would you like to spend your life with me? "I will be thankful to you if you let me tell you my feelings." "I am in love with you... let me take shelter in your eyes." "I will be thankful to you if you let me tell you my feelings." "I am in love with you... let me take shelter in your eyes." "I will be thankful to you..." It is morning. Seems like you didn't sleep all night. I was waiting foryour reply. Let me think over it. The wait is only till 6 pm tomorrow. Same restaurant. I can't come at 6... because I'll reach there by 5.30 Hi... good morning. - Hi... good morning So early in the morning. Where are you coming from? A morning walk. A morning walk or... who is it? Who? - You know it. C'mon Jia, out with it. His name is Aditya... - And? He too is from India. We met by sheer coincidence and that became my destiny. I don't even know how it all happened. I can't... do you know what you are saying, Jia? I know Just one thing. That he is the one for me. He is so loving... he is so caring... and he is so funny. He is so friendly and caring. And the most important thing is that when he is with me... ...he is Just with me. He makes me come alive. I can see that. But you are forgetting that... ...you are Jia Yashvardhan and shall be Jia Oberoi. These two names and their status is much greater... ...than your life and every happiness of yours. I think that you don't know about Karan Oberoi. You rememberthat in your engagement party... ...the editor of a national newspaper got drunk... ...and misbehaved with you in front of the entire press. Yes, but I did forgive him. What you don't know is that Just a week later... ...that editor was killed in an accident and all the offices... ...of that paper were gutted by fire. Karan Oberoi neverforgives. When he loves you... he owns you. I don't care, Jenny. IJust don't care. All this mattered till I didn't meet this one. You don't know him. He is Just like that. Hi, sweetheart. Talking about me? It means you are madly in love Just like me. Angry? I am sorry. I know that I was very busy with the delegates last night. But what can I do? Everybody wants a piece of Karan Oberoi... ...and I'm sure I must have ignored you. But I promise you. I swear on anyone this will never happen again. Now smile... smile... Excuse me, sir. The press are here forthe interview. They are waiting downstairs. Sorry Jia. Can't get on the bad side of press. I'll return soon. Nice shopping, Jia. Doesn't the size look a bit odd? But it's not looking bad. Actually very bad. See only those dreams that you are allowed to. Oryou'll have hard times. Herfather is responsible for her mother's death. She faced many troubles in her life. Such a father should be dragged on to streets... Nawab, she is so lonely you know. Lonely? Why will she be when you are there? I want to see her happy. That's all. I saw anotherJia inside her. I am afraid that she may face trouble because of me. We shouldn't be afraid of troubles. We should face them. I am going for a Jog.

But you surprised me. I don't know why, Jia. The more I see you... ...the more I find you beautiful... gorgeous, stunning... There is some strange intoxication in yourfragrance. Why did you do this... why did you do this to me? Karan! What are you saying? I don't understand. You know who you are to me. Ya... yourfianc?... My fianc?. My fianc?, yes you are going to be my wife. My wife by practice and not by law. So you must have same respect for me... ...which every wife should have for her husband. I have a right on your every breath and thought. Moreover I don't like it piecemeal. Is that clear... Good... Excuse me... Dad! What is this? What is this... What is this? You accused me of killing your mother. That too in front of some stranger. They are trash! See how they ruined our prestige forthe sake of money. Dad I was... - Enough is enough. Jennifer, book us on the next flight. We are going back to India right now. Its okay. Its okay. Excuse me, Jia Yashvardhan, room no 1204. Is she in her room? No, sir. There is no one.

Who the hell are you? Who are you to me? Why should I tell you? So that you can cash on my emotions again? Cash!? You should have told me if you wanted money. My father is a very rich man. You would have got more money than this. What!? - Yes. I told you the things that I was afraid to say to myself. Because I had faith in you. More than I have on myself. But you betrayed me... Jia... what are you trying to say? Read this... read it... Are you okay? - Ya... fine... I didn't get this written. I didn't tell it. Believe me. No... I will never believe anyone from now. I hate you. I hate the moments I spent with you. And I hate myself for having a relationship with you. Jia... Jia... Jia. No... you cannot go leaving me... Jia, I love you. Believe me.

They were so successful that... ...there was no end to buyers' inquiries. And guys, I'm soon going to be a brand name. Give me a five forthat! - You are rocking Sonia! Sonia, what it means is... You have to move around because of your profession... ...sometimes to Paris and sometimes to London. How will you both manage after marriage? We did it till now and will do it in future too. What do you say, Aditya? See, he understands me. He knows that only lucky people get such opportunities. And I don't want to lose this opportunity at any cost. You know I worked really hard forthis. What is the need to wearthis? Anyway you look like your mother. Very funny! He looks so handsome! Now I'll scare grandma. Why are you silent and dull? What happened, Adi? Nothing. I know... I know that Sonia came to spend a little time. But she came foryou only. And we are not leaving her alone. Sonia, you are free to go. Did you miss me? You might have remembered me a little bit. No? It is very good that you didn't remember me. But this time I missed you. Initially I used to think that you are my desire... ...and career is my necessity. But being away from you I realised now that you are my necessity. Now I am afraid of this distance. Shall I tell you something, Adi? One knows how close the other person to them is... ...only when they move away from them. I feel so complete with you. I feel like flying. I don't understand from where I should start this. Why? What happened? Adi, I am the reason for what happened between Jia and you. I am responsible for all this mess... You trusted me and told me everything about Jia. I told everything to my friend in a drunken state. Adi, I... I didn't mean it. I... Believe me, Adi! I didn't know that there was also a Journalist sitting there. He printed all that. I am... I'm not trying to Justify myself, Adi. I know that it doesn't make any difference whether I was drunk... ...or a Journalist was sitting at that place. Actually, I have broken yourtrust. I've taken away... I've taken away your happiness from you. It's okay. Come on, it is getting late. Let's go to work. Please forgive me, Adi. It's okay. C'mon, forget it. "Where shall we go?"

A man shouldn't bump into others like this. First he bumps and then they introduce each to the other. Afterthat both of them fall in love. Same this happened to Aditya. My friend Aditya. Aditya... Jia all messed up. Who's Aditya? That one standing alone. I feel sorry for him. Yes, I know everything about Aditya. No! No, you don't know anything. How can you know that? I'll tell you. Although it's too late. But I'll tell you. I was drunk and told everything to my friends. You fell in love. But your mistake is you loved him so much that... ...a small misunderstanding appeared like a betrayal. Why to talk about that, Jenny? I am married now. No, Jia... Jia... Jia... We love only once in our life. Second time it is Just adJustment. Just adJustment. I feel really bad foryou and really bad for Aditya. Really bad. Aditya... Jia, you shouldn't come here.

If we meet again someday in our life... No. No, that will not happen. That will not happen... I told myself that the time I spent with you... ...are the best moments of my life.

Jia Oberoi Aditya Malhotra... I will always rememberyou. I will always rememberyou. Will you always stay with me? I will always keep you with me. But will you come occasionally to carry my shopping bags? You have good sense of humour. Your smile is very bad. - I know. So, he is Aditya, whom you gave your heart too. No. You love him. There are many faces of love, Karan. But now you are everything to me. But, I saw for myself... I saw you hugging him. That was a weak moment in my life. But believe me, I am yours and only yours. I see... I see... Can you look at me Just once... ...the way you look at him? Can you? Karan Oberoi! You don't know who Karan Oberoi is... You are lucky... you are still alive... Jia is innocent. Who are you to say that? Because of you... Just because of you she isn't mine even after becoming mine. I want to kill you... but how can I remove you from her heart? First you remove this doubt from your heart, Mr. Oberoi. Get lost... Just go away... before I... Just get lost! Why did you do this? Why? It was not in my control. It Just happened. And continued to happen. Why me... why with me, God? I'll bring the taxi. Jia... Jia... are you alright, Jia? Just hold on. Jia. Just give me a hand. Leave me. Jia, Just give me hand. - Leave me I say. The petrol is coming out. It may catch fire at any moment. Don't be stupid. I said get out. Leave me. Fine, Jia. What if you want to be here? Fine... I am also going to be here... this damn car may go on fire... Fine! Why did you come here, Aditya? Why did you come here? Trust me. - Just go away. - Come on. Let me get you out from here. - Just go away. Should I say something? You don't know how to do it. What will I do by staying alive? You need to be alive if I have to be alive. It's Aditya... Adi, go from here... go... Adi... Leave me... Its okay. Just calm down. Calm down. YourJia. Once an Indian woman is married to someone... ...she dedicates her life to him. She can never break that relationship and that's a fact. Aditya... Jia may not break this relationship but Karan Oberoi can. Today I understood one thing. Relation must be the bonding of hearts. If there isn't any bonding then relation suffocates the person. There will be no place for love there. Anyway I don't like anything piecemeal. I want everything completely my own. Come, Jia. You are free from every relation today. Come, you are free. Come with me please, Jia... come. Karan, what did you do? I broke a relation so that a bond becomes stronger. But how can you... How long, uncle? How long should we sacrifice lives in the name of tradition? Relationships are needed for life... ...but life shouldn't depend on them. My choice was correct. But they are made for each other. No, Mr. Oberoi! They are meant for each other.
