- Thanks again boss. It's a pleasure doing business with ya. Have a good one. Hey pretty bird, how are you pretty bird? - We all know that Creutzfeldt-Jakob is cow to man. West Nile mosquito to man. Now Ebola, some believe is monkey to man. Others believe the culprit was a bat. 20 years later, we still don't know for sure. But what we do know is that new viruses are natures bioterrorists hijacking animal hosts... Hmm, encephalitis? Could be a reaction to my dynamic personality. Either one have been known to cause periods of deep sleep. Hello. And our time is up. Do have a pleasant holiday. Relax your brains, come back refreshed. If any of you have any questions over the break, here's my email address. Okay, have a great spring break. Be careful out there, thank you. - Pleasure doing business with you. Thanks boss, see you around. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Barsarato Island. The local time is 9:45. Please remain seated with your safety belts fastened until the captain has turned off the seat belt sign. - What did they, close the island? Where is everybody? - They're all hiding so they don't see you vacationing with your mother. - Welcome to Barsarato Island Dr. Flemming. - Well thank you very much! How did you know it was me? - Let's just say you have an excellent travel agent. You enjoy your stay on the island now. - Oh, I'm sure we will. Thank you, bye bye. - Here, I'll take that. - Oh no, we're alright, thanks. - You want a cab, right? I'll take ya to your hotel or I'll give ya a tour of the island for a good price. What do ya say? - Actually, I think somebody from the hotel's gonna be picking us up. - That's right. - Well, you could be out here all day. Is that what you want? - We're fine really. - It's alright Mr. Banes, I'll take care of 'em. - Take a hike kid, they're mine. - They're staying at our hotel. Dr. Flemming, Kathy Johnson from the hotel. - So good to meet you. - Sorry I'm late. - Maybe you didn't hear me. - Look, is it Mr. Banes? Perhaps another time, thank you. Well, that was pleasant. - Sorry, it's my fault. I should've been here on time. - Oh here, let me get those. - I don't believe it. Please leave me alone. Hello? Yes. - So, you wanna dive today? - Sure, the sooner the better. - Good 'cause I'm takin' ya. My Dad owns the hotel and I'm his dive master. Got the tanks ready to go. - Oh, rock and roll. - So, vacationing with your mom, huh? What's that like? - It's not so bad. She usually behaves herself. Maybe your mom can keep her busy, distract her. - My mom passed away. What, like you were supposed to know? - No but I'm sorry. - No, no, forget about it. It happens all the time. People just assume, ya know? - Yeah. - First thing we gotta do is get that thing away from her and then bury it. - You ever try taking a pork chop away from a coyote? - Ouch. Welcome to beautiful downtown Barsarato, an island with a dark and hideous past. - Oh really, in what way? - Oh come on Ma, everybody knows Godzilla was born here. - That was another island just east of here, the one that glows in the dark. - Oh right. - No ya know, Columbus stopped here on his way to the new world. He took one look at this place and said, "Wow, what a beautiful island. "Let's kill everybody." And they did, they slaughtered the inhabitants and then, took everything they had. - Geez, what was his problem? - Tours from hell. - The next group of people to come were the slaves. They were forced to harvest the salt crop. Ya know, most of the salt used by the civilized world came from this island. - I don't remember reading any of this in your hotel brochure. - Well, we were afraid we would attract the wrong kind of people. - Wise choice. - Cool band. - Everybody's so laid back. It's great huh? - This is paradise. Ya know, we have people that come here all stressed out and they just never leave. We have banking executives working here as waiters just so they could stay. It's so totally cool. - Alright, that's it Mom, I'm staying. Send the rest of my stuff, will ya? - Can I have your room? - Right on. - Poppy, I didn't hit him, did I? - We need an ambulance. Somebody call an ambulance. Do you have a hospital here? - Yes, what's wrong with him? Just step back, both of you. Do you know this man? - Everybody knows Poppy. - So he lives around the island. He has family here? - Yes. - Poppy? Poppy, just relax. I'm a doctor. An ambulance is on the way. Leave him. Excuse me? - Leave him alone please. - Hey, hey! - Hey, hey, hey. - Back off. - It is a good son who protects his mother. Now step back. - What are you doing? Don't touch him! - Linda, it's okay, this is Joseph. - I don't care who he is. This man is seriously ill. He could be highly contagious. - You a doctor? - That's right. Listen to me. You are putting yourself in danger. Where are you taking him? I'm asking you a question! Where are you taking him? Who is that man? - Joseph. - Who is Joseph? - He's a leader of a religious group called The Faithful. They practice natural medicine. Ya know, herbs and stuff. He's healed a lot of people. You know this for a fact? It's what everybody says. - Hello. Welcome to the Tropics Hotel. - This is my father. Dad, this is Dr. Flemming and this is Will. - Mr. Johnson. - Please, call me Paul. We're really casual around here. - Oh, alright then. Linda. - Linda. And you must be Will. - Sir. - Nice to meet you. - Hi. - Well let's get you folks settled in. - We had a near miss on the road. - What happened? - It wasn't your daughter's fault. This man collapsed in the street right in front of us. - It was Poppy. I missed running over him by about a foot. - Was he hurt? - I don't think so, just sick or something. Joseph was there and he took him away. - Well I'll check on Poppy later, see if he's okay. Let's get you folks settled in, then maybe we can all sit down, have a bite to eat. - Oh no Dad, I'm gonna take Will scuba diving. It's the best time at South Reed. - Will, could you take our bags up? - Yeah. - Come on. - Good to meet ya. - Good to meet you too. - What a nice boy. - I'd like to pay a visit to your hospital. - You're not feeling well? - No, no, it's not that. - Well, I can drive you myself. - Would you? - Sure. - I appreciate that. - Sure, come on. I meant to ask you, is your husband gonna be joining you? - I don't think so. He went out for a walk about seven years ago and I haven't seen him since. I did get a post card though from Brazil saying, "Hi, having a wonderful time, "glad you're not here. "Send Will." I didn't. - I see. - Are you sure? He's an older man. People call him Poppy? - Poppy? - The bald guy that sells chickens by the side of the main road. - Oh yes, of course, but he would never come here. Has something happened to him? - Well yeah, he collapsed in the street and I'm just concerned because I noticed that he had open lesions and dried scabs. - Are you sure? - I'm quite sure. My field is virology. A man named Joseph took him away. Is there some other medical facility on the island? - No, there isn't. - Joseph would not take him anywhere near a doctor. I mean, he believes in folk medicine and prayer. So do a lot of other people on this island. - I see. Look, could you do me a favor and if this man Poppy does come in, could you call me? I'm at the Tropics Hotel. - Of course. Dr. Flemming. - Thank you. So, you know this Joseph? - Yeah, he's a friend of mine. - Where can I find him? - He lives on the other side of the island. I can take you there if you'd like. - Well, wait a minute. Aren't you supposed to be running a hotel or something? - It practically runs itself. - Sounds like you really know how to delegate. - You clean it and I'll start a fire. - What, why do I have to clean it? - Because I caught it. You wanna eat, you have to work. - Two people swim up to you with a spear, right? What were you thinking? Duh. - So, how long have you known Joseph? - Well, I met him when we first arrived. He welcomed us. He's quite a remarkable guy. Ya know, he was a champion free diver. Several years ago, he was here on vacation and on one of his deepest dives, he had a religious experience. So much so that the next day, he quit his job and started his own religious movement. - Wow. - Yeah, he has quite a few followers. - Very powerful looking man. - Well, he was a record holder. You won't hear him talking about it. - Your daughter mentioned that he has a reputation for being a healer? - Yeah, he's helped quite a few people. Me included. - Really? - Well, not me actually. My wife. - Your wife? - She died. - Oh, I'm sorry. - I never knew anything could taste so good. - Glad you liked it. - What's not to like? You got the ocean view, the surf and great weather and no smog. - What else? We're gonna kiss sooner or later. - This does not look good. - You sure it's a virus? Maybe it's something else. - We need to get them to the hospital. Who knows how far it's spread? Look, whatever you do, don't touch any of these people. - Joseph. Joseph. - My friend. - I'm sorry to, I'm sorry to intrude like this but, I brought someone to see you. - Doctor. - You have a serious problem here. - Yes, it would appear so. - These people need medical care. Now, I'm sure Paul and I could arrange for transportation to the hospital. - That won't be necessary doctor. We'll be quite alright here. - Look around you. Do you see what's happening? This is what a viral outbreak looks like. - This island has had it's share of tropical illnesses, doctor. We managed to survive. I'm sure this one will be no different than the others. - You're not well. - It will pass. - That lesion points to something far worse than anything you may have ever had. - Joseph, maybe it'd be a good idea. Just this once. - It's alright. I appreciate your concern, my friend, and I'll love you for it. But God will look after us. - I'd like to see the man we were trying to help earlier, Poppy. - Poppy's resting. Perhaps tomorrow. - No, you don't understand. He may be the one responsible for bringing the virus to the island. I need to know where he's been and how many people he's been in contact with. - Again, I appreciate your concern but... - Sir, I respect your beliefs, I do. But when your actions affect the health and well being of other people, something has to be done. - We threaten no one. - Forgive me for saying this sir, but you are being foolish. Now I am very aware of the benefits that can be derived from natural medicines. I've used them myself. But always in conjunction with modern science. Now please, isn't there some way that we could work together? - I'm sorry. - I see. You're not particularly interested in helping people, you just wanna keep them under your control. - Linda. - I don't care, I'm sorry. But this man could end up being responsible for the deaths of everyone in this compound. - Joseph, what would it hurt? Just this once. I mean, God will still be here with them. - It's time for you to go. I appreciate your concern my friend. Doctor. - You're not well, Joseph. You're not going to be healing anybody! - May God bless you and keep you. - Yes, I'd like the number for the Center for Disease Control of Atlanta, Georgia please. - I'll be leaving in a week and I really wish I didn't have to. - Me too. I guess I shouldn't feel this way about someone I've only known for a few hours. - It's crazy isn't it? - But nice. - Yeah. I don't know, maybe there's some way we can. - Maybe, I mean, it's not like you live on another planet, right? - You've never been to Los Angeles. - Right. It's not like you don't have summer vacations. - Yeah. - Well, if you wanna make some money, then my Dad could give you a job at the hotel. - Really? That would be so cool. - Kathy was with you when you helped Poppy, right? - Yeah, I was just thinking the same thing. Keep an eye on her. Tell me if she shows any signs of symptoms, a headache, respiratory problems, anything at all. - I will. - Hey Dad! - Hey, Kathy, are you okay honey? - What do you mean? Of course I'm okay, why? - Come here. - Do you have a headache or any kind of discomfort? - No. Nothing, I'm a little tired. - We had a great time out there Mom. It's awesome, you have to go with us next time. - I will, it sounds like fun. - You sure you're feeling okay? - Yeah! Why? - Oh nothing, just being my regular overprotective self, I guess. - Look, why don't we all get together later and have dinner? Unless you have other plans. - No, sounds lovely. - Okay, see ya later honey. - Yes mother. - She looks okay to me. - I think she's gonna be fine. Good. - Excuse me. Yes? How many patients have you admitted with those symptoms, doctor? How long has he been symptomatic? - 24 hours. Started with a headache, then a fever. - It's hard to tell with this equipment but it's probably a virus. Can we get those samples out to the CDC tonight? - Yes, we can put them on the next flight. - What kinda virus is it? - That's gonna take some research. I have never seen anything like this. I'm gonna need a sample of Poppy's blood. Make sure we're dealing with the same set of viral characteristics. Also gonna have to go back to Joseph's again. But this time, I want the police with me. - That serious huh? - Yeah. Could be. - Put that away. This is fresh from our garden, lovingly hand-prepared for you and your mother. - Oh, she can't make it. - I know, my Dad called. But you have to tell her how good it is. I wanna impress her. - I will. I was just sittin' here thinking if I don't eat soon, I'm gonna die. - Parents don't seem to realize that we have like supersonic metabolisms. If we don't eat every 12 minutes, then a body part just falls off. - What's wrong? - Ugh, too much sun I guess. Getting a headache. - Here, sit down. - Oh, don't you start too, I'm fine. Move your napkin. - Mmm, this looks fabulous. Everything's so fresh here. It's like this whole island's one big health food place. - People don't get sick here hardly. That's why this thing with Poppy is kinda scary. What if this thing is really serious? - I don't know, it's probably just the flu or something. - That's what Poppy had. I've got it. - Kathy. - I've got it, Will. - Kathy. - No, stay away from me! Stay away! - Kathy, wait! - Joseph? Joseph. - Where is everybody? - Joseph! - How soon before the police get here? - 15, 20 minutes. He said he was on the other side of the island. - He? - Yeah, Bobby, he's our only... - You have one policeman. - Yeah, that's all we really need. I mean, there's no real crime here. An occasional stolen chicken. - Amazing. - I feel badly about this. I mean, bringing the cops, even if it's just Bobby. Joseph is gonna have a hard time forgiving me. - Tell me about this Joseph. You say he helped your wife. - Yeah. My wife had cancer and the doctors had done all they could for her and she was suffering terribly. She loved this island. We spent our honeymoon here. So she asked me to bring her back here and spend the rest of her life and I did. When the pain got too much for her to bear, I took her to see Joseph. And he gave her three more months of a pain free life. She died at peace. That I'll never be able to repay him. - It's nice that he was there for her. - Our brother has gone on to the next world. We will miss him. Yes. - The pain we feel is a good thing. Yes. - Embrace it. It will teach us to appreciate those we love while they're still with us. Yes. - Poppy was loved. No one could ask for more. Some of you may ask, where was God when Poppy was sick? Right there. - He was right there with his hands out leading him home. Let us send him to his final rest with his favorite home. - When did it happen? - Just after you left today. - I don't mean to be contentious but now do you see how very important it is that your people go to the hospital and get checked out? - You listen but you not hear. My people have no need of hospitals. - Is God making house calls? - Linda, would you excuse us for a minute? - You like this woman? - What? Joseph, I just met her. Yeah, I like her, so? - It's time you love someone again. - Well that may be true Joseph, but that's not why we're here. - On the contrary, it is why we are all here. - Look, I know what you're doing and I appreciate it, I really do. But we need to get some blood from Poppy. - Poppy is dead. - Yeah, but he's available. - Are you asking me if you can take blood from a dead man? - Joseph, you make it sound horrible. She makes it sound scientific, but yes, that's what I'm asking. - Is this important? - It is to her. - And you? - Look, I wanna help okay? Let's just leave it at that. She's a doctor and she wants to help us. - Who? - Us, everybody on the island. Joseph, do you... If Poppy has a virus, we have to know what kind. - You think she would stay here with you, live here? - I don't know, I haven't thought about it. Well, maybe I've thought about it a little bit. - They're waiting for me. - Wait a second. Are you gonna let her take the blood? - You have to ask Poppy. - Joseph, he's dead. - Finally you have grasped the heart of our problem. - Look, we don't seem to be making much progress here. I need to take a blood sample from Poppy. I'm happy to wait until the services are over but I have to do this. - You have to ask Poppy. - Joseph, it's obvious that you have a fever. You're getting worse! Please let me help you! Joseph! - Linda. - I don't understand this man. - We're not gonna get anywhere with him right now. - What's happened? - This is bad. I have 20 patients with the same symptoms and more on the way. - No, please. Not Kathy. - No, not at the moment, but if this thing evolves, we're gonna need the full cooperation from them, yeah. Thank you very much. - What's up? - We may have a stage five virus alert on Barsarato Island. - And where would that be? - It's between Miami and Guantanamo. It's one of our Caribbean territories. Look it up. - Wow, a stage five. What's that? Ebola? - Uh, I'm not sure yet but we need to start thinking about a quarantine. - Population? - About 2,000 people give or take. I wanna be the first ones through the door on this. If it turns into something bad, I want us to stop it in it's tracks. - Tell me what you want. - I want a team on that island as of yesterday. That's number one. There's a carrier group running exercises near Guantanamo, so if a containment issues arises, we can use them. Wanna know what all the medical facilities are, including the names of all the medical personnel. Find out as much as you can about Dr. Linda Flemming. She's the woman who reported this thing to us. It's my first time out as Operation Supervisor so, I'm gonna be all over this thing. You ready? - What about a press briefing? - No, no, we keep this quiet. You can put out travel warnings but until this situation is stabilized, I don't wanna tell the press. I don't want them starting some major panic. We interrupt this program for a channel six exclusive report. Today, the Center for Disease Control in Atlanta has ordered an emergency team dispatched to an island in the Caribbean called Barsarato. - I have to find my mom. I'll be back. The island has been hit with a deadly, fast spreading virus of unknown origin. A full report will follow after these messages. - Daddy? - What honey? - Am I gonna die? - No, sweetheart, you're not gonna die. We're gonna get you better. You listen to me. I promised your mother that you would have a good life. That you would go to college and one day meet somebody special. - I think I have. - Will seems like a fine young man. - I'm glad that you like him. - Trust me honey, I'm gonna get you well. I'm not gonna let anything happen to you. I promise. According to Dr. Linda Flemming who is on the island of Barsarato, this virus is just as deadly as the well-known Ebola virus and could possibly decimate the entire island population of over 2,000 people. At this point... - Who is responsible for this? I haven't talked to anybody except the CDC. They're gonna panic the whole island! - How'd they get your picture? - This fax just came in from the CDC. - Okay. Viruses unknown. Viruses, more than one. Both containing prions, proteins on the surface of a suspected animal virus string. - That makes sense, there's both poultry and cattle on the island. - Are any of the victims here farmers? - Uh, you're thinkin' in big city terms. - Yeah, here, most people keep chickens. Some have cattle and everybody goes to the market. - What about Poppy? Where did he live? - His chicken farm was out by the lighthouse. I can take you there. - The CDC's gonna be here by tonight. - That's okay, I'll be back by then. Will, you stay here. - Keep an eye on Kathy. - Hello? Hello. Awfully quiet here isn't it? - Yeah, especially for a chicken farm. I think I've eaten my last drumstick. - Well, we have to burn every coup. - How bad is this virus? - It's hard to say at this point. They're unpredictable. One of these days, we're gonna run into one that can't be stopped. - Are you serious? You mean like the end of the world? - It's possible. Certainly more likely than a nuclear war or some meteor from outer space. People don't realize, 40,000 Americans die every year from type resistant germs. It's a serious situation. - I'm John Nevison, Dr. I recognize you from the picture on Channel six. - I had nothing to do with that report. I promise you. - That's what they all say. What are you angling for? A book deal? - Now wait a minute, I'm telling you the truth. - Just so you know, I will retain all rights to my name and any photographs containing my image. I'm joking. We can always count on the media to screw things up. - Yeah, but how did they find out? - The CDC called Washington and well, ya know Washington. By now, everyone on the planet knows we're here. - Well let me show you what we have and then we'll take it from there. What we do know for sure is that the virus is not airborne. - Good. - Who talked to Channel six? - I do not know. - The White House just called. They wanna know what's going on. Who blabbed? - It wasn't us. Heck, it was probably somebody in the Surgeon General's office. - Will you find out who it was? If it was us, I want the leak plugged. - Hi, Dr. Flemming, can you hear me? I'm Susan Holme. I'm the Operations Supervisor here in Atlanta. Can I first say how fortunate we feel to have you on the site and grateful for any assistance you can offer us. And I need to apologize for the news leak. - Yeah, that's caused quite a few problems for us. - Such as? - People are gonna wanna leave the island, people who are already infected. - Of course we're gonna help you screen everyone for the infection. As for people getting off the island, we've already contacted the Navy regarding a possible quarantine. So rest assured that they are fully equipped and prepared for a situation like that. - I have every confidence in the CDC. We're starting to screen everybody but it's hard to get people in. They're too afraid. So, what are we gonna do about that? - Well, we're gonna send more CDC personnel in and form groups and send them around house to house. We're gonna use the media to inform people what's happening and tell them why it's important to be tested before they can be evacuated. We'll do that on a voluntary basis as long as we can. - Okay, that sounds good. I'd like to talk longer, but I really have to get moving. - Understood. Do the best you can. If there's anything we can do for you, we're here. Pick up the phone, tell us what it is and we'll send it to you. - I appreciate that. We'll send you data as we continue to test. - Good luck. - We're gonna need it. - Mom. - Will, you shouldn't be here honey. - Why did you stop for that old man? - What? - Now I'm gonna die because of you. - What are you talking about? He was lying in the street. He needed help. - Look what you did to me. Look what you did to me. Now we're all gonna die! - You okay? - Jet lag. What's goin' on? - We're losing people. We lost four in the last two hours. What I'm finding is that survival rate has a lot to do with their general health and how well their immune system is functioning. Smokers, people with impaired lung functions, forget it, they'll be the first to go. - Well, that makes sense. People who take care of themselves can have a better chance to fight this thing. - You look like you're in pretty good shape. - I wasn't talking about myself. - I jog five miles a day. Am I just a little happier about that right now? Yeah. Now the tricky part is, we thought we were dealing with two separate viruses. - What about now? Crowd forming at North Creek Marina. Alert Coast Guard. This is a download of a before and after scan of the same virus. - It's mutating. - And this one is from a victim we just brought in. - I don't understand. His T-cell count is excellent, he's fighting the infection. - Linda, that is the virus. It's hijacking T-cells using that as cover. - If it looks like a healthy T-cell, we're not gonna know who's infected and who's not until it's too late. - I think you know what this means. - Yeah. Have they notified Atlanta? This is the Coast Guard. Attention all boats. Return to shore. Return to shore! - We're good to go. - Good morning Miss Holme. - Please call me Susan. - Susan. - Good morning Doctors. I know you're very busy but I think you need an overview of our situation. This is an extrapolation based on our data. Are you getting this feed? - Yeah, I see it. - This marks the progress of the virus in the first 12 hours. The white dots represent the reported infections and the red dots are confirmed fatalities. Now, because many of the locals are not going to the hospital, we've adjusted the rate to compensate for that. But based at the present rate of infection, this is what it's gonna look like in the next 12 hours. And in the next 24. And as yet, we don't know if there's any infected people that have made it to other islands but if they have, this is what we're looking at. Haiti, Dominican Republic, Cuba, these are all economically deprived third world nations with large populations. Now how fast it moves into the states is based on an immigration illegal alien figure. If we're using a conservative one infection over 100 ratio, we're looking at tens of thousands of cases in the U.S. alone over the next three months. So as of now, doctors, we have no choice but to declare Barsarato Island a wildfire hot zone and enforce an immediate quarantine. Coast Guard 8-0-7-7 X-ray Adam. - Onset one third eye. Bring craft below 1,000 feet and scan shoreline. - U.S. helicopters today prevented a mass evacuation by panicked residents of Barsarato Island attempting to beat the blockade. Kilo, one-six-five, proceed to specified coordinates. Military patrols have been stepped up and all local shipping is being searched before leaving the island waters. Last night, a freighter attempting to escape under cover of darkness was boarded and returned to the harbor. According to government sources, the people of Barsarato have now agreed to cooperate fully with the quarantine. As anxiety continues to spread throughout the region, local authorities... - Is anybody hurt? How badly? My God, has everybody lost their minds? Alright, don't move them. I'll have somebody pick them up. I need an ambulance to the airport. Two of my people have been hurt. - How, what happened? - Now please. - Of course. - Ambulance is on it's way. This is totally unacceptable. Cancel all incoming CDC flights. - No, wait. - I'm going to tell them to close the airport. If those people grab one of these planes, who knows where they'll end up. - You can't do that! - I'll do the same, thank you. - John, what happened? - Okay look, I don't want any of you to end up as hostages if this thing turns into a riot. I want you to talk to your team, have them ready to move at a moments notice. I'm gonna have a chopper on ready alert and we'll come and get ya soon as you say the word. - Let's hope it doesn't come to that. Right. They're afraid we'll be taken hostage by the people trying to get off the island. - Why? Why you? Why not one of us? - We're government personnel. Taking one of us would force Washington to deal with it. - I don't believe this is happening. Don't they understand we need you here? - They're well aware of that. - Great. My summer vacation, by the late Linda Flemming. - Help me, please! - Kathy, what is it? Do you want me to get the nurse? - No. Take me to the beach. - What are you talking about? - Please William. I don't wanna die here. - Kathy, I can't. You're gonna be alright. - No I'm not. They're all dying and so am I. - No, that's not true. My mother and all these government people are gonna find a way to save you. - My mom didn't wanna die in a hospital. She begged my Dad to take her out of there. And he did, he took her to Joseph. He helped her. - But she died. - Yeah, but she died in my Dad's arms in the open air looking at the ocean. - You are not going to die. - Please William. I'm asking you. Please take me out of here! - I can't. I wanna help you. God, I wanna help you but if I take you outta here, I don't know what might happen. - Okay. Okay. - I'm sorry. - I know. I think I would've fallen in love with you even if all of this hadn't have happened. - Kathy, I know, I know. I feel the same way. I mean, everything is just so crazy. But the first time I saw you... - I know, I could see that you liked me. It gave me goosebumps. It's so weird. I wish that we could have more time. - We will have more time. You've gotta stop thinking like that. You've gotta believe everything is gonna be okay. - I know. - Promise me. Promise me that you won't think about dying. - Okay. You know what I'd like? - What? Anything. - Ice cream. - Ice cream? - Uh huh. - Okay, I'll go down and get you some. - No, no, I mean the good stuff from the Freezalicious. They make their own. - Where is it? - Just a couple blocks from here. - What flavor? - Strawberry. - Alright. - Just go out the front, take a left. Two blocks. - Freezalicious. - Yeah. - I'll be right back. - I just heard, anybody hurt? - One in serious condition with a spinal injury and broken ribs. They don't have much in the way of what we would call a police department down there. - How come? - They don't have any crime until now. What do you think I should do? I don't wanna pull the team off the island but... - If they're in danger. - Exactly. I don't want them to be used as hostages. - Yeah. - If we end up in a standoff, nobody wins. - It's your call. - I know. I'm gonna pull them off the island. - Well, look who's here. - Hello Mr. Banes. - Where to? - Hawk's Nest please. - Kathy? Kathy! Kathy! - What's wrong with that kid? - Nothing. Nothing at all. - Want me to stop? - No, keep going. - Stop! - Not feeling well? - Smoking too much. All those people at the hospital, that lot of good it'll do 'em. - Shoot. - We're taking our team off the island. - You can't do that! - Just until things cool down and then we'll send them back to you. - Excuse me but when do you think that's gonna happen, after we're all dead? - I know what this sounds like Linda, but we're not abandoning you. - Fine, what do we do in the meantime? - Keep working. Our team is gonna be onboard ship. You can easily transmit your data to them. - They will not have the facilities to make use of our findings. Who is gonna help me here? The people at this hospital are not research scientists. - I'm sorry. This is a bump in the road for all of us. - Ugh, that's a bit of an understatement. - Look, as soon as I can pull together a security team that is fully equipped with protective gear so they're safe from the virus. - How long will that take? - I don't know. You have to know that we're doing everything we can to make this work. Please don't give up on us. We're not giving up on you. - Ya know, you owe me a vacation. - I will pay for that myself. - Yes, I'd like a margarita please. And could you move that umbrella a little? It's blocking the sun. - Kathy, she's left the hospital. - I think I know where she's gone, hop in. ♪ Amazing grace ♪ ♪ How sweet the sound ♪ ♪ That saved a wretch like me ♪ ♪ I once was lost ♪ ♪ But now I'm found ♪ ♪ Was blind ♪ ♪ But now I see ♪ ♪ Twas grace that taught ♪ ♪ My heart to feel ♪ ♪ And grace ♪ ♪ My fears relieved ♪ ♪ How precious did that grace appear ♪ ♪ The hour I first believed. ♪ - For a minute, I thought I saw the spirit of your mother. I've seen her here many times enjoying the ocean breeze and clear skies. - Really? - I feel her presence even now watching over you. - Maybe I'll be with her soon. - Maybe. - I wish I wasn't so afraid. - Try it. It's like walking through a door. You leave behind one family and we join another. - How can you be sure? - I've seen the other side. I know how it sounds, believe me. Never less, I was given a look into what lies ahead. There's nothing to fear. Does your father know where you are? - No. I wish he were here so I could say goodbye. - A wish can be a prayer sometimes. The praying that comes from the heart is often answered. It is a beautiful day to be alive. Don't you think? - Yes. - Kathy. Kathy, what have you done? - It's alright Dad. Everything is okay. - It's my fault, I shouldn't have left you alone. - No, no, it's not a bad thing honest. - Listen, we have to get you back to the hospital. - Yes Paul? - You're... - I'm well. - Yeah. - If you don't get those temporary shelters before tonight... - No, don't worry. They'll be here. In the meantime, I think we ought to move the ambulatory patients into the garden area, keep them hydrated until the shelters are up. That'll free up about a dozen beds. - Hey you. I wanna see a doctor. - Of course. If you'll just have a seat over there with the others, someone will give you a form. - I wanna see somebody now! - Mr. Banes, is it? - Yeah, that's right. - If you don't sit down, I'm gonna have you put in restraints. - You people are all alike. Put on a white coat and you think you're God. - We'll be with you as soon as we can. - We didn't have this problem 'til you showed up. Anybody notice that? - Look, we'll get to everybody as soon as possible. Thank you for your patience. - We're getting more people like him all the time. They're angry because they can't get off the island and they're blaming us. - I know. Fear spreads faster than a virus. Yes? Paul, what is it, what's wrong? Are you sure? Where are you? - Have you noticed the way your dad looks at my mom? - I know. They look good together. - Look at him, he's obviously better. - You say it as if it was something that could not be. - It's amazing. May I? - If you must. - Have you taken something? Medicine, something you made from herbs? - I have taken only what God has given me. - No please don't do that. I need to know exactly what you've done to get well. - I believe, woman. That is what I have done. Go thou and do likewise. - Joseph, your blood will have antibodies to the virus. We can make a serum from it and heal everyone. - When are you going to believe me? What you are looking for is in the air around you. It is in every living thing. When you open yourself to God, you'll find all the answers you need. - I understand that. I am opening myself to what is here right now and what I see is that God may have put you here to save the lives of everybody on this island. - You learn quickly. Your words flow like honey but they come from here instead of here. - Look, this is not about who's right or who's wrong or how we should live. This is about life and death! Paul's daughter is gonna die if you don't help us. Will it help for me to say that you're right? That you have been able to find what has eluded the rest of us? Okay! You're right. We should be more like you, but right now, there is not time to change. - Can still reach out and find the way. - Joseph! - Joseph, I tried. Don't you think I've prayed every moment? I can't find that place. I can't find that calm in the midst of all this chaos to listen to what God has to tell me. But that's why there's people like you so that people like me can be helped. So that we can hear what God has to tell us. So you talk to him for me. You tell him a father will do anything to save his little girl. You tell him that I would give my life. You tell him please. - Take what you need. - Thank you. - Thank you. - We're right behind you Will. Be careful. - Yes sir. - I love you Daddy. - I love you too honey. We're gonna get you better. You hang in there, promise? - Promise. - You know, when I picked this island for a vacation, I was told absolutely nothing happens here. No traffic, no crime, nothing but sunshine, peace and quiet. - Considering the circumstances, do you really believe it was your choice to come to this island? Linda? - Lady, I need to see a doctor. - This is a restricted area. I need you to leave immediately. - I want treatment! - Can somebody take care of this man? Dalia. Dr. Flemming, where are you? He's not here. He's taken his team to the airport. We had an incident. Two men tried to take Dr. Nevison hostage. He was wounded, they're being evacuated. I'm told they won't be allowed to come back to the island until the military can secure it. - How long will that be? A week? No, that's not possible. They've gotta come back. Look, I may have a cure. I just found somebody who had the virus and he recovered. Yes! I just took his blood. Now you've gotta stop Nevison and his team from leaving. - I'll do what I can. What? - They're evacuating the CDC team. - Lord, no. - Yes, to whom am I speaking? Miss Ellen, this is Dr. Dalia from the hospital. There are a group of people from the Center for Disease Control on their way there. You must have them... Yes, yes, please put him on. - Nevison. Are you sure? Look, my people aren't safe here. We're under orders to leave. - But you don't understand! She has a potential cure! She's bringing the blood in now. They're only at Hawk's Nest. That's 45 minutes away. If you leave now, we may not be here by the time you get back. - Will? Oh no. Are you alright? - I'm fine. Fine. - Banes. Excuse me. - We've got an emergency man. You gotta move your car. - I want that cure. - Whoa, whoa. - Where is it? - God, he's insane! - Take it easy. Wait a minute. What are you doing? - You try it. - You can't have that! No! No! - Don't do this. Listen, you don't know what you're doing. - I know what I'm doing. Move. - We need that to make a serum. You can't just inject it. - Back off. - Don't do this. Banes, come on. We may be able to help you. - I'm through waiting in line. - People could die because of you. - Don't follow me. - Banes! - Wait Paul, don't touch him. Use this. - He's dead. - Get the bag. We have to get this blood treated right away, let's go. - Is she okay? - Everything's fine. - Where's my mother? I have to talk to her. - Relax, she'll be here soon. - I can't see anything. What's happening? - Everything's alright. - Will? - I'm right beside you. - Don't leave me, okay? - Never. - It's me, we have a problem. The car broke down. What? I can't hear you. You're breaking up. - There's a car. - What? - Alright, we'll be there soon as we can. Stop! - Stop! - Stop! - Has everybody gone crazy? - The virus, they're all terrified. Oh my God, they're leaving. - How can they leave? We have the blood. - Look! - Hey, stop, stop! - Here, take this. Stop, please stop! We need help! - Linda! - Stop the car! What's your problem? - Hey, we gotta get to the hospital, okay? Thanks. - Thank you! - Go, go! - Go! - I can't do anything without the CDC. - Maybe we'll get lucky. Maybe we can do this by ourselves. - I can't even walk. I can't keep my eyes open. - You gotta keep going. My daughters life depends on it. - Dr. Flemming, they're coming back. The CDC just called, I told them about the blood and they're coming back. - They turned back. - Who? - Our team, they were on route to the USS Madison and then they turned around and went back. - Nevison. - Yeah. - You know what? Call the President's office. I want him to know that in the middle of nowhere on an island hardly anybody's heard about, there are Americans helping other people that are disobeying orders to do it. You know what, no matter what anybody says, when the stuff hits the fan, we're always there. Tell him that. Be happy to. - Tell him I want a year off. Got it. - Mom. - I'm right here. - Has this been fun or what? - I love you. - Can you save her? - Absolutely. - Truth. - I don't know. Dr. Flemming, Dr. Flemming, you're needed in the lab. - Wow, you look as bad as I feel. - Thanks. Actually I was just about to go play some tennis and then get a massage. What can I do for you? - Okay, I won't keep ya then. How's your son doing? - He's holding his own. - We're praying for him, Linda. We're praying for everybody there. Can you give me an approximate ETA on the serum. - Well, we just were able to hook up with your main computer, so that should give us a leg up. Once we're in the same ball park, so to speak, we should be able to make some real progress. - Good, that sounds promising. - Yeah, it is if you have a few weeks to work with. We don't. Here's the problem. We've been able to track the progression of the virus on a typical patient and it's become very clear to us that if we don't come up with a serum in the next 24 hours, we're gonna lose just about everybody we have here, including my son. - I see. So, we've got 24 hours. We have til six PM tomorrow. - Yeah. - Okay, I really won't keep you then. Everybody here is praying for you. - We need all the prayers we can get. - No, I told you before, we tried that already. It doesn't work. Look, it's right there on your data sheet. Pay attention for God's sake. You're wasting time. - Hey. - They've gotta work together. We are duplicating - I know. - failed procedures. - We're all dragging right now, we need our second wind. You need to take a break. Just close your eyes for a minute. - Forget it. - John, I'll wake you in 15. Go on! You're no good to us this way. Sir, coffee. - Daddy? - Yeah honey? - I love you. - I love you too more than anything. - And Will. What about Will? - He's here. He needs you to keep going. - He does? - Yeah, yeah listen Kathy, he told me he can't make it without ya. He said he needs you to get better. Do you hear me? Don't let him down. - Okay. - John! John! Take a look. - I think you've turned a corner for us. Print it out. - You got it. - Linda, Linda? Linda. You were giving me a progress report. - Where was I? - You're making progress. - We're close. - How close? - This close. - How you holding up? - Just signed up for an aerobics class. You wanna join me? - Yes, absolutely. Linda? - Yeah? - Thank you. - For what? - For absolutely everything. - We're not there yet. - No, I know but... - Hey. - Yeah? - Your people, they did good. - I'll talk to you soon. - Yeah. - Another hour. - Yeah. We're cutting it really close. - Garden area. Fast as you can. - 16. - Thank you. We're all done baby. Okay, we're all done. - I love you honey. - Oh God. Thank you God, thank you God. It's four AM here in Basarato, the scene of round-the-clock celebrations today as the islanders give thanks for their deliverance from the epidemic that threatened to wipe them out. - Well, hello. - Oh hello. - You guys. - Have fun! - Okay, you too. They look good together. - They sure do. I have to tell ya, when we first got here, I was a little concerned. I mean, they just took one look at each other... - Oh I know, bang, they were gone. Guess it happens like that when you're young. - Yeah! Remember how that felt? - Yeah I do. - I hope it works out for them. They deserve something wonderful after everything that's happened. - Well, there's always the risk that it won't but, hey, I think it's worth it, don't you? - Yeah. I do wonder though, maybe it was the extraordinary circumstances, all the drama, what happened that led them to this point. That wears off after a while. - Sometimes I think it takes something like what we've been through to make those emotions flower and even though circumstances may change, the feeling that's inside of both of them won't go away. Right? - I hope not. I would like to see them happy and in love for the rest of their lives. You? - More than anything. - Come on you two! Let's join the party! - Oh, we'll be there! Save us some fun! - Okay! - So when do you go back? - Oh, I've got a ton of follow up on this virus. CDC wants a complete analysis of our methodology and I have to do a breakdown on the different stages of infection. - Sounds like a lot of work to me. - Two months at least. - Really? That long? What about your job? - I'm gonna take a leave of absence. This is too important. - Two months. - Yeah, at least. But, this is an ideal location for studying viruses. - Sounds more like three months to me. - Maybe even more. - And where have you been? - Enjoying myself. You should try it sometime. - I was. - Let your laughter be a blessing to others. - I never really have thanked you yet for what you did. - Me? I did nothing. - You saved the lives of our children. - It is flattering to see thanks for God's work. Come, I want you to dance with me - Oh. - Show the Lord we are truly happy with all that he gives us. - I really am not a good dancer. I can't. - Sure you can! Come on Paul, show your woman what it's like to be an islander. - I think I already have.
