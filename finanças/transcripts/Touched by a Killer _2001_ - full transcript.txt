Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil. (heavy breathing) (prayer layered on top of itself) (intense music) (door creaking) (door slamming) (electricity buzzing) (screaming) (phone ringing) (gasping) - Oh! Ugh. Hello. - Nicki, where the hell are you? You're supposed to be at the courthouse. They're reading the Valdez verdict. - (sighs) What time is it? - [Liza] It's 10:30. - Oh, the alarm didn't... Okay, am I in trouble? - Well, Bernie's at the courthouse covering for you. But you better get down there. - Yeah, coming. (phone beeping) (phone thudding) (somber music) - [Mitchell] And sentencing will take place on Tuesday the 16th. The state expects the maximum sentence. - Sir! - Excuse me! - Mr. Clarke, Mr. Clarke? - Yes? - [Reporter] That could mean the death penalty. Do you not find that kind of punishment harsh? - Well, of course it's harsh. But this is going to send a clear message to those who believe that they can disregard the laws of our community. - Excuse me, sir. - Sir. - And then when do you proceed with the trials of the other two defendants? - Within the next two weeks. - Now, you'll have to excuse me. Assistant district attorney Warren Penn here will be glad to answer any further questions. - How do you feel about being called a mongoose? - Fine by me. As long as I get the snakes. - Hey, sorry I'm late, I overslept. - We'll talk about it later. Let's catch him before he gets away. - [Warren] We expect the same results from two other indictments. - Mitch! - Bernie, you old dog, what are you doing here? Well, you got a big case coming up. - One down, two to go. - And just in time for the election. - It's got nothing to do with that. - Oh, that's not what your campaign manager told me. (laughs) Just kidding, Mitch. - Har, har. - This is my niece, Nicki Barrington. Nicki Barrington, this is Mitchell Clarke, our district attorney and local mongoose. - How do you do? - Nice to meet you. - Nicki grew up around here. She's just come home from New York City. - Well, welcome back to Marshall Falls. We could use some new blood around here to liven up Bernie's stodgy old paper. So what do you think? - Well, Bernie's stodgy old paper doesn't endorse politicians. - You know, Bernie, that's what I like about you. You are one of the few truly righteous people left in the world. - [Reporter] Penn, Mr. Penn, Warren, Warren. - He doesn't know how right he is. - [Reporter] Mr. Penn, the people don't agree with this. - [Reporter] Mr. Clarke! (door clicking) (keys jingling) (somber music) (door creaking) - Can I come in? - Yeah, sure, come on. What is it? - R.J. sent me a package last night and wants me to cover a story for him. - How's he doing? - Not good. - Well, that's too bad. - Yeah. - What's the story? - There's this guy over at Midvalley who's scheduled to be executed next month. - Tyler Nash. - R.J. doesn't want you to cover the execution, does he? - He's convinced that the guy is innocent. - Okay, you go ahead. Just make sure it doesn't interfere with your work on this paper. - Thank you. (paper rustling) (gentle, melancholy music) (knocking) - Nicki! Nicki! (gasps) Hey, open the damn door, it's cold out here. - Coming. (door creaking) What the hell you doing out here? - Well, I've been knocking at the front door forever. (door thudding) - Sorry. - Oh, this is totally unacceptable. - I think I look stunning. - Really? Ooh, so what happened here last night, huh? - Wild research party, very exciting. - Yeah? Well, you forgot to sign off on the net and I have been trying to call you all morning. - Oh, sorry. - [Liza] Did you forget our seminar this morning? - I did, but I've got to go to Midvalley penitentiary today. - Oh Nicki, they finally busted you. - You're very funny in the mornings. - (laughs) Ooh, now this is worth working late for. - That is my Midvalley lunch date. - What? - R.J. asked me to interview him, do a story. - [Liza] Oh. (pills rattling) - Having trouble sleeping lately. - So try a glass of warm milk, anything but those. - My doctor prescribed them. - The dreams again. - Yeah, since I moved back. - So move, sell the place. - I like the place. - Yeah, but too many bad memories. - [Nicki] Oh, come on, Liza, I'll get over it. - Yeah, before or after you get addicted to those? - Honey, how long have you known me? - Oh, ever since second grade when Jimmy Lane stole your notebook and I had to beat him up to get it back. - So, still worried? - As a matter of fact- - God, you're so annoying. Please make me some coffee, I'm taking a shower. - I love you, too. - Mm. (apple crunching) (somber music) - So Wayne wants to ask you out. - [Nicki] Oh, please. - He's a nice guy. - Oh, if he's so nice, why don't you go out with him? - Well, because I'm not the stepmom type, and besides, he likes you. - Liza, you know something, you're obsessed. I mean, why are you so compelled to set me up all the time? - I just want my best friend happy. - I don't need a man to be happy. I like my independence, and I like having control of my life. - Oh, I'd like to be out of control just one last time before I start getting hot flashes. - Thanks for the coffee, by the way. (sighs) You are a goddess. Mm. (chuckles) - "Debbie, you know who I am if you remember this poem: Passions drift amongst the silken flesh, beads of sweat drip slowly down sunken and surrendered crevices giving breath to conscious rapture." Nicki. - It's the Midvalley guy again. - So what's he in for, bad poetry? - Close, murder. - Oh. Well, for someone who likes to be in control, I think you picked an interesting person to interview. - I didn't pick him, R.J. did, okay? - Mm-hm. (footsteps tapping) (tense, eerie music) (door creaking) (buzzing) (door creaking) - Thank you. - Sit over there, please. (door thudding) (clock ticking) (door buzzing) (chains clinking) - Where's Mr. Malone? - He asked me to come in his place. - Who are you? - I'm Nicki Barrington. I'm also a journalist. - He said he'd help me. - [Nicki] He said he would write a story. - What does that mean? - It means I'm going to get to know you over the next few weeks. - What do you get out of it? - The chance to write a piece that might convince the state to change its views on capital punishment. - So it doesn't matter whether I'm innocent or not. - Not here to pass judgment. - So what do I get out of it? I mean, you don't have a story unless I'm executed, am I right? - Mm. So who exactly is this Debbie? - She's my missing witness. No, I don't know her last name, and if she comes forward, I would get an appeal. - Well, this was front-page news. If she exists, why didn't she just come forward? - Oh, she exists. Maybe she's scared. Maybe she moved. Maybe she doesn't care. - The D.A. convinced the jury you lied about her. (laughs) - You're beautiful. - Let's just stick to business, all right? - Hey, I just meant it as a compliment. - Tell me about your lawyer. - Nothing to say. Look, I don't have time to go a hundred miles to get answers like that, all right? - What are you getting mad at all of a sudden? - I'm not getting mad, I just, I don't have time to play games. - I'm not playing games. My attorney was court appointed. He told me I should throw myself at the mercy of the court. I did. Here I am. - [Nicki] "A full moon kindled the white beach in front of a local bar in Marshall Falls the night Cecilia Flowers decided to take a peaceful midnight stroll, but she was not alone. (woman screaming) Someone had followed her out of the Blue Moon, stalked her, and waited for the perfect moment to attack. The moment she was most vulnerable. The moment she was totally alone. Her killer sprang upon his prey like a black cat. He took her young life with the slash of his blade against the soft flesh of her neck. Cruel, cold-blooded, no sympathy, the animal drank her fear like wine. (woman screaming) What happened to Cecilia Flowers that night was inhuman. No one should have to submit to that kind of terror. Marshall Falls, beware, there's a bogeyman out there." (man chattering) - [Man] Needed to file half. (man chattering) (door thudding) - [Man] I filed the appellate brief, but I'm still looking to get a plea bargain. - [Man] Well, the only plea bargain they're gonna give you is manslaughter mandatory eight. - I don't think that's true. - I think so. (door creaking) - [Man] Well, we'll see. (men chattering) - [Nicki] So you raced cars. - [Tyler] Stock cars. - [Nicki] Win much? - I won my share. - Okay, I'm sure this is the last thing you want to do again, but you want to tell me what happened? - (sighs) I was passing through Marshall Falls. I had a couple of days before a race near Portland. It got canceled, so I decided to stay on. - Several people at the Blue Moon saw you there with Cecilia Flowers. - That's right. She was sitting at the bar, so was I. We had a couple of drinks. That's all. We left at the same time, but we both went our separate ways. And then you went to this other bar where you picked up this Debbie. - Yes, Deek's. - Deek's. Okay, so how come no one at Deek's remembered seeing you there? - I don't know. I guess we got outta there pretty quick. Then we drove to the beach. - Did you sleep with her? - No. We talked for about two or three hours. - [Nicki] Then what happened? - Then I took her back to Deek's where she picked up her car and that's the last I ever saw of her. - Tyler, why did you run when you knew the police were after you? (somber music) - I honestly don't know. (thunder roaring) (rain splattering) - [Reporter On Television] Today Mitchell Clarke, county prosecutor, makes his closing arguments in the Tyler Nash trial. He will most likely focus on the fact that Nash had no alibi And remind the jury that an eyewitness placed Nash at the scene- (tape humming) Flowers, a young Marshall Falls resident. Jury deliberations are expected to be short. We'll continue coverage of this story Once the jury has reached its verdict. And now, back to our newsroom, Ted? - [Hospital Announcer] Dr. Henry, please report to I.C.U. Dr. Henry, please report to I.C.U. - [Nicki] Dr. Vowers. - Yes. - [Nicki] Hi, hi, I'm Nicki Barrington from the Democrat and Sentinel. - Ah, you said it was important I see you. - Yes, yes, it is. Thank you so much for taking the time. Doctor, five years ago you performed an autopsy on Cecilia Flowers, a murder victim. - Flowers. Flowers, yes. - You might recall that Tyler Nash was convicted of that crime. Now, in your testimony, you concluded that Ms. Flowers' throat was slashed from right to left. You're asking me to recall a murder case that took place over five years ago? - Oh, I read the court transcripts, doctor. You stated that the killer slashed Ms. Flowers from behind using a right-to-left motion and because of that, he had to be left-handed. - Yeah, so? - All right, well, isn't it possible that the killer could have slashed her from the front? - I don't know, possible. - Well, if the murderer killed her from the front, using your logic, he'd be right-handed, isn't that so? Now why wasn't that mentioned in your testimony? - What is your point, Ms. Barrington? - Tyler Nash is scheduled to be executed next month. He might be innocent. - All I did was give my professional opinion and answer the questions asked to me, now, you have to excuse me, I'm late and I've got a lot of work to do. Yes, of course, thank you for your time. - Now, why didn't your attorney challenge the Flowers autopsy report? Tyler, you're left-handed. What if the murderer slashed the flowers girl from the front? My new attorney used that argument as part of an appeal for my retrial. - (sighs) All right. Okay, another witness for the prosecution, Roger Walker, said that he saw you with the victim in your truck at the Blue Moon just before she was killed. - He lied. - Okay, why do you say that? - Because it didn't happen, that's why. How could he see something that didn't happen? - Sometimes witnesses have completely different accounts of the same event. - Do you always do that? (tense music) - Do what? - That little thing with your hair? - How can you be so cavalier? (somber music) - I'm not. I just miss the simple things. Like that little thing with your hair. (phone ringing) - [Woman] Good afternoon, Techway Corporation. - Yes, Roger Walker, please. - [Woman] Mr. Walker is in Houston on business. - When is he expected back? - [Woman] The end of next week. Is there someone else that can help you? - Is there a number where I can reach him? - [Woman] I'm sorry, we're not permitted to give out that information, but if you leave your name and number, I'll relay the message. - No thanks, I'll just call back. - Nicki, you got a minute? - Sure. What's up? - I want you to go to Olympia and cover the state congressional runoff. What? - Well, can't Wayne or Liza do it? - [Bernie] Why? - I'm not up on my state politics. - What's going on, Nicki? - It's that thing I'm doing for R.J. - Well, that thing wasn't supposed to interfere with your work on the paper. - I know. - Ah, you better sit down, Nicki. This came in on the wire this morning, and I wasn't gonna give it to you until after work, but... (somber music) - [Nicki] Newsman R.J. Malone died early this morning. Oh, my god. - [Bernie] You okay? Yeah. - Oh heck, Wayne is probably tired of working on that fast-food toy scandal anyway. I heard his kids are giving him hell about it. - Thanks. - You seem tense. - Oh, well, um... I've just had a bad couple of days. You know, I haven't slept well. - What's going on, huh? Hey, come on. I've been honest with you from the beginning. You gotta be honest with me. - R.J. Malone died. - Oh man. How? - Cancer. - You two were close, huh? - Hey, did this Debbie ever tell you where she lived? - (chuckles) No. - [Nicki] Did you ever ask her? - No. Nicki? What's going on? Come on, you're in agony here, what's happening? - I'd worked with R.J. for ten years, you know. I mean, I knew it was coming, but... He was like a father to me. - (sighs) I'm sorry. - What was your father like? (chuckles) - My dad, he spent most of his life beating the hell out of me and my mom. - Is your mother living? - No, yours? - No. - You know, when my mom died, I truly knew that I was alone in the world. Things wouldn't come easy. - (laughs) Yeah, I guess I know what that feels like. - I got something for you. (clears throat) - "Drop a pebble in the lake and watch the waters part until the rings reach every shore and touch some other's heart. I stand near the water's edge, praying for a sign that somewhere across the mist of time, there awaits a heart like mine." You wrote this for me? - Uh-huh. - I like it. (sighing) In case I'm not here, and you want somebody to talk to. (door closing) (tense music) (woman screaming) There were no traces of blood, hair, or fiber from the victim found in his truck, on his clothes or in his motel room. And there was only one eyewitness, Roger Walker, and his testimony was circumstantial. - Why, 'cause Tyler Nash said so? Oh, please. - How about this? You cannot condemn a man to death no matter what he did, it's barbaric. - Are you falling for this guy? - No. - Good, 'cause I wouldn't want to have to identify your body just because this guy turns you on. - [Nicki] Liza! Well, why can't you admit that you have hormones just like the rest of us? - Okay, you've hurt me enough, I'm gonna go solo. - And besides, I don't believe his story about the missing witness. I mean, anyone can be found. - Only if they want to be. - Yeah, well, what if he killed this Debbie, too? - Okay, and what if this Debbie was in on it? What if the whole thing was a setup? - (sighs) This is starting to sound like a soap opera to me. - Liza, be serious for one minute. What if he's innocent? - Everyone on death row is innocent, hasn't anyone ever told you? I am so sorry. I, I, oh, please. - It's okay. - Forgive me, Nicki. - Liza, it's all right. - I'm sorry, honey. Sometimes I say the stupidest things. (somber music) (phone ringing) - Hello. Hello. - [Tyler] Hey, it's Tyler. - Hi. - I hope you don't mind me calling. - [Nicki] No, no, I told you to. - Look, we got five minutes before they pull the plug here. - Well, that doesn't seem fair. (gentle jazz music) - I hear music. - [Nicki] Yes. - Ha, that sounds nice. Tell me about your home. - You have five minutes and you wanna make small talk? - You know what? Actually, that's exactly what I'd like. - Okay. I live just outside of Marshall Falls, about a hundred miles north of you. I'm surrounded by trees in the middle of nowhere. - That's nice. - Tell me, what's inside your home? - A lot of knick-knacks, you know, it's woodsy, cozy, big fireplace. - Wow. So tell me about you. - Me? - Yeah, you. Not much to say. - [Tyler] Oh, sure there is. - What do you wanna know? - I wanna know everything. - Wanna know everything in five minutes? - Yeah, it's a start. - [Nicki] I used to live in New York. - So, why did you move back? - I guess the city got to me. At least in Marshall Falls, everybody knows who you are. - Ah boy, that is not always a good thing. - (sighs) Anyway R.J. used to say that writing doesn't come from big cities, writing comes from the heart. - Like love. - Tyler. (sighs) - I can see you. - What do you see? - I see your loneliness. I wanna see you. - Tyler, Tyler? (phone beeping) (sighing) (somber music) (sighing) (door buzzing) - Wow, you look beautiful. - What's that? - These are... I drew these for you. (paper rustling) - You really did this? - Yeah. Does it look like your place? - Yeah. Yeah, it's amazing. Is there anything you can't do? - Yeah. Touch you. Hold you close. (paper rustling) (sighing) I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die in two weeks. (sobbing) (somber music) (soft moaning) (intense music) (phone ringing) (screaming) - [Nicki] Tyler! (gasping) (paper rustling) - You just happened to be in town on the night of the murder? - I saw you on that trip, too, remember? - Nick, you don't know anything about this guy. - He is not a killer. Believe me, I know this trial inside and out. Clarke, Clarke went after Tyler, like- - Like a mongoose after a snake? - Nick, you're putting me as well as yourself in a very compromising legal position. I know you're about to commit perjury. That makes me an accessory. We could both face serious jail time. - Liza, no one will ever know that you know. You have my word. - Oh, that's great, just great. - I thought you were my friend. - Don't do this, I am your friend. I am your best friend, which is why I'm trying to talk some sense into you. - This makes perfect sense to me. I have never been so sure of anything in my life. - (sighs) I don't know. - Okay, Liza. This conversation never took place. Now, it's either that or you turn me in. (dark, dramatic music) - Judge Robertson just ordered a stay of execution for Tyler Nash. - For what reason? - Seems his missing witness finally showed up. Motion for a new trial has been granted. Scheduled for the 11th. - Nicki Barrington. - Works at the Democrat And Sentinel. - Bernie's niece. Get me everything you can find on her, school, friends, sex life, addictions. - Gotcha. - Tyler, I can do this, I can! I know every aspect of your trial. I was in town visiting my mother when the murder took place, and there is nothing about this Debbie that couldn't apply to me, it's perfect. - I don't buy it, okay? You don't know what you're getting yourself into. I can't let you do this- - No, no, no, look, all right, there is no law against my visiting you. All of our conversations have been private. And besides that, Tanaki already deposed me and filed another motion to retry. So, I'm sorry, but there is no turning back. (somber music) - [Steve] Ms. Barrington, How did you come to meet Tyler Nash? - I was living in New York. Every year during August I came back home to Marshall Falls to see my mother. I heard about this place called Deek's. I was there that night. - What happened at Deek's? Shortly after the band started, Tyler Nash offered to buy me a drink. Now, had you ever met the man before? - No. - [Steve] He told you his name at this time? - Yes. - What did you tell him your name was? - Debbie. - Debbie. Why did you do that? - I didn't want to give out my real name to a total stranger. - [Steve] I understand. Please, go on. It was pretty crowded there. Mr. Nash couldn't get a waitress, so then he suggested we leave and go back to his hotel room. - [Steve] And did you go? - Of course not, not with a man I just met. - What did you do then? - We went to the beach and talked. - For how long? - A couple of hours. - [Steve] Now, during the time that you were parked, did you see anyone? - Just a few people coming and going from the bar across the way. - The Blue Moon. - Yeah. - [Steve What happened when you finished talking? - He drove me back to Deek's. I got in my car and I drove home. - Ms. Barrington, these events took place over five years ago. Why have you not come forward until now? - Well, like I said, I didn't live here at the time. I returned to New York, never having heard about the murder case or Mr. Nash's indictment. - [Steve] And what made you come forward at this time? - My mother recently passed away. I was packing some of her things for storage with old newspaper, and I came across one of Mr. Nash's personal ads. And it was then that I realized he was looking for me. - Now, the murder took place between 9 p.m. and 11 p.m. on the night of the 20th. Can you confirm to this court that you were in fact with Tyler Nash during that time? - Yes, yes, I can. - I have no further questions, your honor. - Mr. Clarke. - Thank you, your honor. You're a journalist, is that correct? - [Nicki] Yes. - Therefore, one can assume that you are street-smart, that you understand the ways of the world. - I suppose. - So, can you explain why it is that you refused to give your real name but you agreed to park on an isolated beach with, in your own words, a total stranger? - I don't know. I suppose it's not the smartest thing I've ever done. - When exactly were you parked, Ms. Barrington? Was it 9:30 to 11:30, 10:30 to 12:30, when was it? - I believe it was ten to midnight. - Two hours, that's a long time. Did you have sex with him? - No. - [Steve] Objection, your honor, irrelevant. - Sustained. The jury will disregard the question and the answer. - What did you do all that time? - We talked. - [Mitchell] About what? - Poetry, art, music, life. (sighing) - Do you recognize this girl? The mutilated body of Cecilia Flowers. Pretty gruesome, I agree. Have you seen her before? - No. - She was 21 years old. - Objection, there is no connection between the victim and Ms. Barrington. - [Mitchell] your honor, there most certainly is a connection. Ms. Barrington is trying to undo the conviction of a killer. - Objection, your honor! - Objection sustained. - Mr. Clarke, stick to straightforward and relevant questions. - Ms. Barrington, I'm a little puzzled by something. We asked for a sample of your hair. We checked it against the trace hairs we found in Mr. Nash's truck and on his clothes and it was conclusive, your hair did not match. - Objection, the victim's hair did not match either. - Objection sustained. The jury will disregard the prosecution's last statement. - Then there's the matter of your father. Isn't it true that he, like Mr. Nash, was on death row? That he in fact was executed at Midvalley state penitentiary in 1967 for the murder of one J. Hollis Meyer? - [Steve] Objection, your honor, this is completely irrelevant. - Your honor, it is directly relevant! It speaks to Ms. Barrington's motive. A very powerful motive for wanting to get back at the justice system for taking her father's life. (crowd murmuring) (gavel banging) (knocking) - Coming. Hang on. Uncle Bernie, hi. - Can I come in? Yeah. Hey, I was just about to make myself an egg salad sandwich. You want one? - Not unless you want to watch me skywrite all over your ceiling. - What? - Gas. (laughs) You haven't really changed this place very much, have you? - Nah, it's still Mom's place. - You ever get the feeling that she's still with us? - Always. Then she must be feeling like I am right now, confused. - Confused? - Why are you doing this, Nicki? You weren't in Marshall Falls when the Flowers murder happened. That's when you drove your mom to Portland to start her breast cancer treatments. You called me every day, remember? So, why are you putting yourself in this position? - What position? - Perjury. - I'm not. - Nicki! Don't insult my intelligence. - This is not your concern. - Yes, it is. One, I am your uncle. Two, it implicates the paper. - There is nothing that ties you or the paper or the staff to this. - I know what you're doing. How can I claim to have any integrity and not expose that? - Can't you see what they're doing to him? It's just like what happened to my father. - [Bernie] Your father was found guilty. - And he was innocent. - Damn it, Nicki, no he wasn't. (dark, dramatic music) - How can you say that? - Have you ever bothered to investigate the facts surrounding your father's case? Or are you afraid to find out something? You gotta grow up, Nicki. He was guilty. I knew it, your mother knew it. She just didn't have the heart to tell you about it. Your father had a temper! And one day he just snapped, and he killed his boss in cold blood. - No, he didn't! (sobbing) - Please. Don't throw your life away for this guy. We talk to Mitch, we'll tell him this Nash coerced you into lying for him. - Oh. I can't. (sighing) - You mean you won't. - I believe him. - Oh. (sighs) Nicki. I've got a responsibility to the people in this community and to the people who work for me. If you proceed with this charade tomorrow, you can't come back to the paper. I promised your mother that I would take care of you. (door creaking) - [Bailiff] Roger Walker, do you solemnly swear to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth before this court? - I do. - Mr. Walker, in the previous trial of Tyler Nash, you testified that you were at the Blue Moon on the night of august the 20th. - That is correct. - And that at approximately 10:30 p.m., you left the bar and you saw a man and a woman seated in a parked pickup truck. Is that correct? - Yes, sir. - You went on to identify the man in that truck as the defendant, Tyler Nash. - That is correct. - Now, I'm gonna show you a photograph, Mr. Walker. I want you to examine it very carefully. Was that the woman that you saw seated next to Tyler Nash in that pickup truck on the night of August 20th? - No sir, it is not. - [Mitchell] Are you sure? - Positive. - I've just shown mr. Walker a photo of Nicki Barrington. - Mr. Walker, is this the woman that you saw seated in the pickup next to Mr. Nash? - Objection, your honor, leading the witness. - Sustained, rephrase the question, counselor. - Do you recognize this woman? - Yes, sir. - This is the woman that was seated in the truck. Let the record show that Mr. Walker has clearly identified Cecilia Flowers as the woman who was sitting in Tyler Nash's truck on the night of the murder. I have no further questions, your honor. Your witness. - Mr. Walker. What do you do for a living, sir? I'm a computer programmer. I create networks, websites, things of that nature. - Would you consider your powers of observation to be above average? - Yes, I would say above average. - Now, we're supposed to accept your testimony. Testimony that has to be based, not only on your powers of observation, but on your memory as well. So I'm sure you'll agree, it is very important to be certain. - Yes, I understand. - Good. Now, where was the pickup truck parked? - It was in the parking lot next to the bar. - But was it parked, let's say under a street lamp, against a building, under a tree? - Uh... It was just parked in the lot, quite a few cars there. - Mr. Walker, you don't sound terribly convincing. Does that mean you're not sure? - I remember it was quite cloudy that night. - [Steve] Let the record show that the night of August 20th was clear and with a full moon. - Mr. Walker. Did you stop and look into the pickup truck as you passed by? - I looked in and I- - Did you stop, sir? - I don't remember if I stopped, but I did get a good look. Your honor, I ask permission to bring Nicki Barrington before this witness. - [Mitchell] Objection, your honor. - On what grounds, counselor? - Mr. Walker has already clearly established that Nicki Barrington was not in Tyler Nash's truck that night. - Your honor, is the prosecution now gonna try my case as well? - Your objection is overruled, Mr. Clarke. You may continue, Mr. Tanaki, but this better be leading somewhere. - [Steve] Thank you, your honor, it will. - [Bailiff] The court calls Nicki Barrington. - [Steve] Ms. Barrington, would you kindly step forward and stand before the jury and witness? - [Steve] Auburn hair, shoulder length. Brown eyes, 5 feet, 7 inches tall, approximately 125 pounds. Mr. Walker, was I just describing Cecilia Flowers or Nicki Barrington? (tense music) Well? - Ah... I don't know. - Why? What happened to your above average powers of observation? Could it be, sir, that you don't know because I am describing both Cecilia Flowers and Nicki Barrington? Mr. Walker, your testimony convinced a jury beyond a reasonable doubt to convict my client, Tyler Nash, to be sentenced to death at the hands of the state. (crowd whispering) - Has the jury reached a verdict? - We have, your honor. - How do you find? - In the matter of The People vs. Tyler Nash, we find the defendant not guilty. (crowd gasps) - The court is gratified that justice has ultimately been done in this case. Mr. Nash, you are released from custody. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, thank you very much. This court is adjourned. (gavel banging) - Thanks. - Wait up, wait up. (crowd chattering) - Congratulations. - Free man. - There's just some papers you have to sign before you leave, if you'd go with the bailiff. - Yeah, okay. - Thanks, counselor. - Thank you. - Oh, come on, Steve, you were great. You freed an innocent man today. - I hope you're right. Excuse me. (dark, somber music) (car clanking) (gentle, peaceful music) - This is it. - This is great. This is really nice. Wow. (sighs) - Look at that, isn't that pretty? - Yeah, it is. (soft moaning) (upbeat, jazzy music) Hey. (sighs) You okay? - I forgot what it was like. - What? - To be free. - You know something?

(dark, dramatic music) (gun clicking) - It's pretty remote out here, you know. (gun clicking) - It's a good idea. - What do you want? - Five minutes of your time. - Sorry. - You're racing down a dark stretch of highway with no lights on. - Nice metaphor, you're in my way. - That's one hell of an act you and Tanaki put on. - Isn't this called harassment? - No, I'm just having a conversation.

He was there approximately three months before he was arrested. Why are we looking into this? - There's an unresolved murder down there similar to the Flowers case. - Mitch, that case is over. - No, it's not. At the time of the Florida murder, Nash just happened to be racing at Daytona Beach. - Mitch, that's gotta be a couple hundred miles from where the murder took place. I need to know if the race was before or after the murder. (dramatic music) (sighing) - [Liza] I agree. I just think we should crop it about here. - Unless you run it vertically. - Ah, you're right. Shows more of his character. - That's a scratch on the negative. He's a slumlord, remember, he doesn't have any character. (laughing) (dramatic music) - It's an unresolved murder near Tallahassee, Florida. Happened before Nash came to Marshall Falls. - [Bernie] So? - So he just happened to be there around the same time. - Shouldn't you be out campaigning? I hear votes are scarce around here. - Bernie, your niece is playing with fire. - If that were true, what do you suppose that I could do about it? - Convince her to come and see me. I've got some new information that might change her opinion about Mr. Nash. This one's on me. - Our tax dollars at work. (gentle, peaceful music) (gasps) (dramatic music) - Are you okay? - Yeah. I just didn't hear you sneak up on me. - I didn't sneak up on you. I just came to ask if you wanted to go to town for lunch. - Yeah. Sure, just give me a minute, okay? - Okay. - Ever been to Florida? - Every winter. - Why? - Daytona Beach? - Sure. Racing season. - Mitchell Clarke spoke to Liza and my uncle. He's trying to tie you to a murder there. - God, why doesn't that surprise me? Is he getting to you? - No. Are you sure? - Hi, do you guys know what you want? Yeah, I'll have the pasta special, please. - I'm gonna have a cheeseburger and fries, thanks. - Great. - They took five years of my life, what more do they want? I mean, I... - You can't keep blaming the world for what happened to you. - You're right. It's just... (sighs) I wish it was that easy. - I haven't held anything back, I've never done that before. - Nicki. I would never, ever hurt you. (clattering) (dramatic music) - You two got a lotta nerve showing up here. Cecilia Flowers was a friend of mine. - You know what? Let's just get out of here. (punch thudding) (glass clattering) - Tyler! (clattering) - [Woman] Stop it, please! (groaning) (grunting) - Tyler, stop it! Stop it, you're gonna kill him! (grunting) (siren blaring) We've been here for almost three hours. If you want to hold us any longer, I'd like to call my lawyer. Otherwise, let us go now. - Your boyfriend put those guys in the hospital. - (chuckles) Those guys started it, and there's a room full of witnesses who'll testify to that. - (chuckles) Testify, you'd know all about that, wouldn't you? - My phone call? (banging) - Follow me. Free to go. (door buzzing) (door creaking) (dramatic music) (knife clicking) (screaming) (phone ringing) - Hello. - Nicki? Mitchell Clarke. - I'm hanging up. - Does the name Peg O'Neil mean anything to you? - No. - What if I told you this woman claims to have been Tyler's girlfriend at the same time as you were visiting him in prison. If you want more, meet me at Largo, 3:00 this afternoon. (phone beeping) - Who's that on the phone? - The paper. They want me to clean out my desk. - [Mitchell] So, Nash was charming other women at the same time as he was charming you, as you can see by this. The guy's a regular Shakespeare. He worked on Peg O'Neil-- "Drop a pebble in the lake and watch the waters part until the rings reach every shore and touch some other's heart. I stand near the water's edge, praying for a sign that somewhere across the mist of time there awaits a heart like mine. You wrote this for me? - Uh-huh. - So you dig through other people's garbage? - Nash used you, Nicki. He's still using you. - Do you love anyone? - What? - Do you love anyone? Is there anything in your life that you care about more than your career? - I care about justice. I care about truth. - No, you don't. You care about winning, that's your truth. (keys clinking) - I called your work. They said you weren't there today. - Yeah, I had some thinking to do. - Thinking about what? - Peg O'Neil. - Peg O'Neil. Peg O'Neil responded to an ad a couple of months prior to you and I ever becoming involved. And we wrote to each other a few times. Nicki, you can't believe that you were the only one that I communicated with. - What do you mean I can't believe that I was the only one? What am I, a mind reader, Tyler? You know that Clarke had a file full of that stuff that you sent to Peg O'Neil? Including that sweet poem that you wrote to me. You led me to believe that that poem was written for me, and you even tried to get her to be your alibi. But she wouldn't do it, she refused. And what did I do, I believed you. I lied for you! I stood up in front of all those people in the courtroom, and I risked everything for you. (dramatic music) (phone beeping) Come on, come on, Liza. - [Liza] Hey, it's Liza, you know the drill. Leave a message and I'll call you back. (beeping) (dog whining) (dramatic music) (sighing) (glass clinking) (water splashing) (melancholy music) - Were you here all night? (sighs) - I lied to you. With Peg O'Neil, I know you feel like I used you. I'm sorry for that. I've never had anyone in my life care for me the way you do, and I'm trying to learn how to deal with that. I love you, Nicki. I love you with all my heart, and I want to show you in a way that you know and that you can understand. It's just... It's just, I need a little help. To learn how. Want some? - No. I'm gonna take a bath. (dramatic music) (door creaking) (door creaking) (gasping) (slow, jazzy music) - [Tyler] Don't leave me. (knocking) - Coming! Just a minute. - Good morning. - Excuse me, ma'am. - [Officer] Pardon me. - [Officer] Spread 'em, spread 'em down here. - What the hell is going on here? You have no right- - This little piece of paper gives us every right. It's a search warrant. - Why? - A young girl was murdered last night on the beach near Canaan Point. - Canaan Point is three hours away. - I told them I was here last night. - Oh, but of course you were. - Look what I found. - I have a permit for that. - [Man] Check it out. - How many more women are gonna die because of him? Because of you? What is it anyway, what's he got over you? - Mitch. - Just a minute, Sam. - I really need to speak with you. Let him go. You should put this where your boyfriend can't find it. - Don't leave town, Nash. (chatter over police radio) - [Woman On Radio] Suspect described as a white male. (cars revving) (gun clicking) (drawer slamming) - Tyler! What are you doing? Where were you last night? - I was out driving. Clarke thinks that I killed that girl. Apparently you do, too. - Running away isn't going to solve anything. It's just gonna make matters worse. - I'm not going back to jail! - This is exactly what they want you to do. Don't do this! - Can't you see that I have no choice? Nicki, come with me. - What? If we leave now, we can be in Canada in less than two hours, come on. - This is crazy. - God, every time there's a crime within a hundred miles of here, Clarke is gonna be all over me! I have no intention of waiting for him to come back. And he will come back. - But he's got nothing on you! - That didn't stop him last time. - If you run now, everyone's going to be convinced that you're guilty. - Are you coming or not? - No. No, not like this. (dramatic music) Ty, I really wish you wouldn't do this. - Come on, pack your stuff. - What? - Pack! - Who the hell do you think you're talking to? - Hey! (table clattering) I said pack. (phone beeping) - Yeah, hey, it's Nicki for Liza. All right, then let me speak to my uncle. Yes, it's urgent. Oh, come on, come on. All right, okay, would you just tell him that- - What are you doing? - I'm not going with you. - Oh, I get it. The second I'm outta here, you're on the phone to Clarke. (suitcase unzipping) - [Nicki] Okay, come on, stop it. - Hey! - Hey! Tyler, that's enough. - Hey! - Cut it out! You're hurting me! - Leave me alone! (grunting) (dramatic music) (sighs) (nervous murmuring) (engine revving) - [Tyler] Hey! (screaming) - I still think you should call the cops. - I can't. - Yeah, yeah. I know. - Liza, what is wrong with me? - Hey, you fell in love. - I mean, I'm a reasonably intelligent woman. How could I be so stupid? - No, no, naive is more like it. Will you ever forgive me for what I put you through? - Are you kidding? You've always been there for me, always. It's just my turn, that's all. - Thanks. - You know, with our luck maybe we should just give up on men. Okay, bad suggestion. (laughs) - I really appreciate you letting me stay at your place for a while. - Are you kidding, it's gonna be like old times. You know, sleepovers, summer camp, cheap white wine. - Oh no. - [Liza] What? - I left my purse at the house. My credit cards, my driver's license, everything is in that purse. It's all right, we'll get it in the morning. - I don't wanna go back. - Hey, don't worry, all right? No one's gonna mess with me. (laughs) (thunder roaring) - [Nicki] I don't feel good about this, let's just make it quick okay? - [Liza] Oh, don't worry about it. (door creaking) (sighing) - Oh, my god. - You know what, I don't know if this was such a good idea. Maybe we should just go. - Oh, we'll be fine. - All right, help me find my bag. - Sure. Ah, here it is. - Great, let's just go. - Sure. (door thudding) - And look, I know you think I'm paranoid, okay, but... - What? - It won't start. My cell phone is gone. - Oh, you probably left it in the house. - No, it was right here, I know it. - Well. - Where are you going? - [Liza] Oh, we'll call from the house! - [Nicki] Liza. Liza! - I tell you what, you make the call, I gotta pee. Can't you just hold it? - [Liza] How long have you known me? - Ah! (phone beeping) Ah, oh, oh great. Great, there's something wrong with the phone. Hey, Liza, listen, we're gonna have to go to my neighbor's house, okay? But it's only about a quarter of a mile down the road. We can use the phone there. Liza. Liza, come on, I really wanna get outta here, okay? Not funny. (tense music) Liza? (door creaking) (intense, dramatic music) Oh! Oh! (sobbing) (keys jingling) (screaming) (gun clicking) No, don't come in! I swear to god! - Stop it. - Come any closer, I swear to god, I'll shoot you. - Nicki, give me the gun! - Give me the gun! - I swear I'll shoot! - Nicki, take it easy. Give me the gun. Nicki, stop it. (sobs) It's all right, Nicki, just- (gun firing) (sobbing) - Why did you do that? - Oh, what a tangled web we weave. (tense music) I knew you weren't there that night. - Oh god! Oh, dear God. Oh, please! - 'Cause I took care of the real witness. - [Tyler] Get out of here. Go to the car and get out of here. - Don't, don't, don't do this. Oh, but I want to. Ty, don't worry, I'm not gonna leave you. - [Tyler] I said go. (sobbing) - Besides, they already know who I am. You see, I kind of slipped up the other night at Canaan Point. (laughs) - Oh my God. (sobs) Don't. - I am gonna enjoy you. (grunting) (groaning) Do you like that, does that hurt? - [Nicki] Tyler! Come on! (screaming) (grunting) Get away from... (grunting) (gasping) (chuckles) (gun firing) (shouting) (grunting) (coughing) (peaceful music) - Tyler? Don't die! Honey, please, don't go. I'm so sorry. Come on, stay with me. Goodbye, Liza, I love you. (gentle, jazzy music)
