The Tourtereaux's divorce OK, OK.. Don't you want to talk? Remember when our parents played it at the bar? I remember. It's 200 years old. Don't ruin my day. I waited 5 years for this transfer. Aren't you afraid to come home? No. I'm sick of Paris, aggressive people. I want calm, quiet. I hope you like it. - I got the cruise tickets. - What cruise? For their 40th. I told you to wait. Who's that? - A new conquest? - No. It's work. I'm through, with chicks. I'm single, I swear. Are you married? No. Like me. I'm not looking for my soulmate. Look at Mom and Dad. It does exist. - Yeah, like a fairy tale. - Oh... There they are! What a nice shirt. Elvis wore it in Jailhouse Rock. - It's all he wears. - Oh, Mom... - Did you dye your hair? - Highlights. - Beautiful. Youthful. - You think? Like a baby. So the Muppet Show is still here? So glad to see you. A breath of fresh air in a cold world. - What do you mean? - Just joking. - Shall we go in? - Let's go. I'll make you a mint soda. Let's go. - Aren't they weird? - They're happy to see you. - I'm gonna park. - Coming! Come on! It's better in here. May I? I've never seen the bar so empty. Maybe because it's off peak hours. - Eh, Cindy? - Yes. Pretty as always. One day a Prince Charming will take Cinderella away. It'll be too bad. It won't be tomorrow. No Prince Charmings here. Straw. Want to see the house? - Yes. Coming. - Come on. - What's this? - Our new endeavor. We get packages for people. Nice special. - Coming to dinner? - Yes. - Save it for dinner? - Take it. - No, Dad! - Yes. - It's ridiculous, we're moving. - "Ridiculous", she says. - Aurélie... - Yes? I'm glad you're back. It's good, honey. It's good. - Aren't they weird? - "Weird"? You think? You'll see. Put it down. Well. It's not... But... Eh? No! Do you see this mess? You said it was done! Yes, hold on. Relax. It looks bad but it's not: a little paint, electricity... Some plumbing... A little of everything! You're in the country, so relax. Breathe, calm down. You're not homeless. Live with Mom and Dad. I have to finish the Moisans' bathroom. - Wait, Richard. - What? What Moisans do you mean? Uh.... Christelle and Pierre. I thought they lived in the southwest. They came back 3 years ago. I told you. No. - I'm sure I did. - No. I guess you haven't been back. Pierre inherited his dad's house next door. He said: "Richard, can you fix it up?" And I said: "Bingo, Petey!" Just like that. So Darth Vader is back. You still call him "Darth Vader"? Seriously... Get over it. It's the dark force. It's been 10 years. I thought you moved on. The first love hurts the most. You wouldn't know you've never been in love. Why do you say that? Things change. People change. Nothing's in stone. - Nothing. - What were you saying? Nothing. Will you give me a hand? OK, but tell me. Who is it? Richard! - Don't you have anything? - Yes. You just play a 10? Don't you see Chantal's stuck? No, no! Wait! - No! - He played his 10. - This isn't fun! I'm done! - What's this? - Did you tell her? - I couldn't. Her face when she saw Pierre was back... - We have to tell her. - We'll wait for tomorrow. - What's up? - Your room. - He'll show you. - Come on, sport. You're not playing around. I don't know how to play but I feel lucky. Oh, honey... - How are you, Dad? - Good. I'm glad you're back. Me, too. I'm happy you're here, too. Where is the puppet theater? We put it away. With the old stuff. Don't you do shows? You loved that. Your mom loves Zumba now. And no one cares about puppets now. I care. It's in your room. So you have it. OK. I'm going. See you. OK. Let's go! There's a TV in Richard's room? No. I sleep there now. My snoring wakes your mom up. - You have separate rooms? - It's temporary. Don't worry. OK, settle in. I made your favorite food. Veal blanquette? Thanks, Daddy. See you. What are you doing? Put that down! I can taste it! - Put it down! - No! No, you can't! - Put it down! - No! - Put that down! - No! - What's going on? - Stay out of it. She ruined my blanquette! Tell your mom to get out of my kitchen. Out of my kitchen! It's mine, too! I put in a pinch of salt. I didn't kill anyone. You know the kitchen is Dad's thing. Thanks, honey. She messes it up. She can't even fry an egg. You haven't made anything good in a long time. It's salty, burned... And I'm surprised a good chef drinks pastis before cooking. One drink. One drink! And she calls me an alcoholic! Exactly. I don't have high cholesterol from inhaling cookies all day! Here! Are you insane? - How are you, Dad? - She hurt me. - I can't see. -He's OK. Pansy. All that for 3 peanuts. I swear... It's OK. It's OK. Have some water. Step aside! Step aside! What did she do? She ruined my kitchen. She's ruining my kitchen. She's ruining my kitchen! Aurélie, can I talk to you? Coming. Calm down, Dad. Stay there, OK? Chantal, Albert, watch him. Hold on. - Here. - Thanks. Drink this. More. I'm listening. - I'm leaving. - OK. Good night, Cindy. No. I'm leaving. I quit. What? It's just a little fight. A fight? They fight all day, it's been a year. The bar is empty. Didn't your brother tell you? No shocker. He's a coward. "1 year"? Impossible. OK. Hold on, give me time to talk to them. It'll work out. Aurélie. The kitchen's burning. OK, Fredo. I know. No: it's burning. Fire! Fire! It's burning down! Move! Where's the extinguisher? Stop! Stop! Stop! Give me that! The blanquette! It's your dishrag! You left it here! Who left the rag here? - I didn't see. - Albert? And you say nothing! Enough! Will you shut up? "It's him!" - They're like kids! - She's right. What's wrong with you? "My blanquette!" It's burning down and you're fighting! Get out! I don't want to see you! Out! Just great! - I'll do it. - Here. It'll change you. We have to talk. You forgot to tell me some things. Really? - Go. - You want a divorce. What? We're getting divorced. We didn't want to tell you like this. You're joking? You can't get divorced. Not you. You've never been apart. I keep telling them that. You've done the hardest. But, when it's over, it's over. I disagree. Marriage is for life. Now when something is wrong instead of fixing it, people just go. Fredo, that's not nice. It's not because of you. Roger had a heart attack. Not your fault. Not because of me... She's blubbering. Stop! She keeps sobbing! We're not on TV. We're not debating marriage. - Come on, stop. - Cry somewhere else. Oh my... It can't be. It just can't be. You're such a close couple. Last year when you came to Paris you seemed in love. Not anymore. That's it, Dad? She said it all. You're better than that. Everyone gets divorced now at the drop of a hat. It's hard to find someone you want to live with when you find them, shouldn't you stay? Look, honey, I know you're upset but it'll get better. A divorce is really stressful. It's in 2nd place for causing depression after a death. It depends on the case. We thought Chantal would stay out of it and she isn't. She does a lot, she goes hiking, plays Scrabble, she made friends. - And she sobs. - She always has. Living alone is hard. I should know. I won't stay alone. I want to meet someone. - She believes in Santa. - Oh yeah, sure,... Laugh last, laugh loudest. Come here, Cameron. Come see Mama. Here, doggie. Here, doggie. Come see Daddy. Cameron, come to Mama. Cameron, come to Mama. Come to Daddy. Where's my dog? Cameron, come to Mama. Come to Mama. Marcel, you get him Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. It's Tuesday. - It's my turn. - Can I kiss him? Don't worry, doggie. Here. It's a hard time. Don't worry. Good to go. I was a little harsh, but... Don't talk like that to your mom. It's bad, huh? - I'm going. - Why didn't you tell me? I didn't want to upset you. You were so happy about their 40th anniversary, with the cruise.... Is it refundable? You're just giving up already? They're going on that cruise. We're not Tourtereaux... Look, it's the dark side of the force. - Hi, Pierre. - Hi. Excuse me. I have walls to paint. It's nice to see you. Yes... Nice, sure. Like going to a used bookshop. Want to get a drink? Between the trip, the move... Sorry. I understand. - Maybe another time. - Yeah. "Another time". Bye. He's running up the field! - Pass the ball! - Who can stop him? Does he see? Cross kick. Excellent reception. He sees the other team, rushes in! Kick! He tries to take it on his good foot! Go! Kick! - Another hook! - Go! Shit! What's going on? I missed the goal! The fuse blew out! It blew out! - It's OK, Dad. - How? I missed the goal. OK. Calm down. Don't move. I missed it. - What's going on, Mom? - This fuse keeps blowing out. It's awful. I have to fix it. It's constant. What a beautiful goal! We saw in slo-mo it wasn't out of bounds. The goal counts. Goal of the year! It's gone. - I was on the phone. - Oh, yeah? - I have to see a customer. - Oh? Yes. What? - You found out for her husband? - Yes. It's awful, awful... Is it closed? - What's going on? - Liliane! Marcel! It can't be true... Why are ou yelling? It's 8 and Cindy isn't here. I have a client in an hour. Dad's at the market and... I don't know where Mom is. She's not answering. Come in. Come on! Warm up! - So? Coffee all around? - Of course. - Don't forget. - Yes. - No! - What's wrong? Cindy's resignation letter. Cinderella left without leaving a slipper. It's not funny. How do I replace her? Customers aren't breaking down the door. It's not the 1st time we help out. Why are they divorcing? Obviously I know why. - Tell me! - I won't betray my friend! - Fredo, you know. - Nope. Tell me, can it be fixed? I want to take them to l'Auberge de l'Etang, where they got engaged. It burned down. The elements are against me... Divorces are like wars: stay neutral. Fredo and I do everything to avoid conflict. - Huh? - We tried it all. She just doesn't want to play with us now We have to play with Albert. Not a good trade. I'm going to see Chapon at City Hall! Gilbert Chapon? He died 3 weeks ago. We have a new mayor now. It's... Yes! An interim mayor until elections. That's it. Didn't you know? Isn't there any good news here? It's tiring. What are the Chapuis doing here? - Hi, honey. - Hi. Bonjour. Want some coffee? Romain will make it. He'll have to learn. Soon he'll be the boss. I'll show you. Check out the kitchen. Why? Oh yeah. OK. Hi, Aurélie. Happy to be home? If I may, given the circumstances... News travels fast. What's he doing now? Romain, I'll show you the kitchen. See you. Liliane, what's that mean? Bernard and Odette want the bar. You're selling it? We'll have to, Aurélie. - You can't do that, Lili. - Not to them. They're the only buyers. That's high treason. Come on! Excuse me. - Come on, Albert. - Albert! I'm sorry. - Mom... - What's going on? What are you vultures doing here? What are you doing? Stop, Marcel. I invited them. I want to sell them the bar. You want to sell them the bar? You know the bar belongs to both of us. Over my dead body. - Bernard, say something. - Yes, dear. Marcel, don't take it that way. We just want to help. - You want to help? - Yes. Shut up. You'll have to sell it if you divorce. Why not to us? Why not you? Especially not you. Outside, lady. Come on, honey. Come on, son. "Bernard, say something." "Yes, dear." "You'll have to sell, why not to us?" "Yes, dear." "Son"... - The mayor will see you. - Thank you. Christelle? Hi, Aurélie. I'm so glad to see you after all this time. You seem surprised. Have I changed a lot? No. I didn't expect... You didn't know? I'm managing the transition. We didn't end on good terms, but water under the bridge. We'll work well together. Sit down. I'm surprised you replaced Mrs. Pichar. - Did you ask for a transfer? - Yes. A while ago. It's a great opportunity. Pichar is retiring this year. With your resume, it's a great shot. They opened a private school nearby. I lost students, I'm counting on you. Pierre says hi. He's your parents' divorce attorney. That's not happening. They're having a rough patch like any couple. It'll work out. I hope so. The only bar in town is hostile now. Their package delivery is a disaster. Maybe it's time for them to retire. I know some people who are interested. The Chapuis? They came this morning. Great. So it's happening. Perfect. If you say so. I'm having a cocktail party tonight. To introduce myself. I hope you come. Most families will be there, and... Oh, I know. It's hard to come during the year, it'll be OK. I've got a meeting. I'll come back. What are you doing at the Chapuis'? Cindy's working for the enemy. She won't change her mind. She's a baker. You'll see her. She makes croissants. Croissants! Being a baker is a career, isn't it? Yes... You're right. Thanks for telling me about Christelle! Yeah. About what? 2 minutes. It takes hours, all that to play badly... - How's this? - Good. - How are you, honey? - Just great. My parents hire my ex as a lawyer, his wife's the mayor. Otherwise, just grand! - That's Odette Chapuis. - And her brother. Her brother's in parliament. That's why she's there. In 4 years they bought the fish store and florist. You? They wanted the salon, but I said no. - Oh, yeah! Fredo, he said no. - "Fredo, he said no." Why did you hire Pierre? He's the only one in town. He's a nice guy. Oh yeah, real nice. He's nice. You're telling me that? He's the reason I left town. They're having relationship problems. If I were you, I'd get revenge. Yes. I don't care about their relationship! I came here to live in peace, not be annoyed. I came home to jars of paint. - Fredo... - What? "Pierre's a nice guy." You should have said it again! Did you forget? Shit... No... You let the dog eat my shirt? He found it. Your things are everywhere, so... Give Daddy the shirt. He won't give it back. It's his blankie. He tore it apart. You touch him, and I call the Humane Society. He has eczema. The vet said it's stress. It's your fault for yelling. - Then I won't speak! - It's a vacation. - Hi, everyone. - Hi. Hi, Jean-Paul. My uniform arrived. Yes. Here it is. - Here. - It took a beating. It's OK. As long as it's not ripped. A uniform doesn't break. But still... Want a pastis? It's my turn. No. I'm on duty. - He's on duty. - I heard. Bye. - Bye, Jean-Paul. - Bye. Can I do my glasses? Can I do my glasses? My Elvis shirt... The dog has eczema? Richard? Are you there? Cindy's dating the Chapuis' son? Yes... It's OK. They say they're in love, leave you, 3 days later they've got someone else. - Are you in love? - What? Me? No. Stop. It's exhausting. You see love everywhere. Like with Mom and Dad. You're in denial it's over. Doesn't it upset you? What do you want me to do? What do you want? I know something happened. Something bad. I'll find out. Come on. You never let things go. You're incredible. Incredible. I invited them to City Hall to end the rumors. That's risky. - I don't want to go alone. - Great! Do you want me to go? Don't worry, little sister. I'll protect you. I'll be your Jedi. What is this blue? What? You picked it. It's the sample. We said blue for the bedroom, beige in the kitchen. - In the bedroom? - Well, yes. What color is the bedroom? No, wait. It's not dry. You can't see. Liliane! Oh, Nino! - What a surprise! - So... This... It's nice to see you. - You're beautiful. - Thanks. - What are we having? - Champagne. Fredo. You know that guy? He's Nino, the Zumba teacher. Handsome, eh? You think? No. - A toast first. To what? - To love. OK. To love. - And Zumba. - Yes. To you. - That looks good - Thanks. Hi. Hello, Miss. Excuse me. Don't even try. Can I say hello? You will not humiliate me. You're pitiful, Christelle. - Do you have the file... - We'll talk later. Hi, Aurélie. - How disdainful! - Maybe she didn't see us. You find excuses for everyone. Pierre. Where were you? - I was here. - Really? Wait. Christelle is giving a speech. - Ladies and gentlemen... - Quiet down, please. For the mayor's speech. - Thanks, Marcel. - You're welcome. - Ladies and gentlemen... - Fredo, Albert, are you coming? Presidents and leaders of associations, business owners, entrepreneurs, and craftsmen... Thanks, Marcel. It's OK, Marcel. Thanks. Elected officials, Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for turning out... Enough, now! ...and being here to... Marcel! Thank you for coming, and for doing me the honor and sharing a drink at this fantastic buffet... Marcel, I think that's enough. - Thank you. - Quiet down, please. With the members of our community... Knock it off! Gigolo! Fuck your Zumba! Ridiculous! Stop! Stop! What do you want me to say? I apologized a dozen times! OK... Did you think about me? My students won't respect me. My mom puts on a show, my dad thinks he's Rocky. Jealousy looks real good. - After what you did to me... - What did he do? He cheated on me. Look what he did. What? Is that true? - Come. - Odette, don't do this. I'm looking in. When the florist died, a year ago her son found a letter she wrote to him. At the burial he put it in his pocket and I found it cleaning his suit. That's when I knew he was cheating. On the old lady. Gisele Puech, the batty old lady? Before being old and batty, she was young, pretty, and wild. Come on, Mom... This'll be bad. It's a copy. The lawyer has the original. I know it by heart, she's read it to me 100 times. I'll leave you to my trial. Don't run away. "Run away"? Where? I ran away? - I'm here. -That's true. He's here, he didn't go. - Sit down. - I'm sitting. He's sitting! What does it say? "My Cecel..." "Cecel"... OK, it's pathetic but it shows their intimacy... Yes. OK... "June 2, '88 is one of the best nights of my life, "my best memories. "I know our affair can't last "and I'm sorry. "Liliane is so lucky "to be so loved, "a chance I'd like to have but never will. "Thanks for everything, especially your honesty." I also thank you for your honesty, Marcel, because at the time I was in Grenoble taking care of your mother. - You didn't want me to go! - Sure... - You said: "Manage the bar." - Yes... - You didn't want to! - Yeah. I asked Gisele to babysit. So Dad could stay at the bar. - It seems she did more than that. - Come on... - Tell me something. - What? I said sorry a dozen times! She got revenge. I paid for my mistake. She's tortured me for a year. a year! Want me to kiss your feet? No. It's been 25 years. 25 years. There's a limit. How many times was it? This stupid letter... It was once. Once in 40 years. It's ridiculous. Thanks, son. Oh, OK. How many times before it's bad? - Mom... - How many? I agree. What he did was bad. But one mistake, in 40 years together, it was just a blip. You forgive a mistake. And I was drunk. That's no excuse. Who says there's no one else? I can't wait for the divorce. You want the divorce, it's your move. Enough! Go to bed, we heard enough! I hope the tickets are refunded. - What tickets? - What tickets? We planned on giving you a cruise. - Why? - For your anniversary. - Really? - Yes. That's so sweet. It's sweet but I get seasick. You know that. The cruise is weird. It can't be! There's always something wrong when we go anywhere. You're afraid of flying, hate the train, don't like driving... - And it's expensive. - You hate it all! - Stop. - That's not the problem! There's no cruise! OK? Are you happy? For once you agree. I told you to wait. It's a mess, now. Tourtereaux, turtle brain! Tourtereaux, turtle brain! Tourtereaux, turtle brain! That's no good. You'll break a window! Come here! Go, run away! - Hurry up! Run! - Come here! Come here... They got away? You need to work out. They had bikes. Bad luck! Like father like son! Pierre Moisan Attorney Hey! - Hi. - Hi. - You... - What? Sorry. My humiliation knows no bounds. I like that about you. - Can we talk? - Yes. In my office? - No. Let's walk. - OK. Do you have a Kleenex? How could you participate in this mascarade? Should I send them elsewhere? No, you tell them that's not the answer, help them. - But that's less lucrative. - You're not fair. I said yes to try and change their mind, I knew it would upset you. I was surprised you didn't call me. Go figure, I didn't know. You have to slow down the proceedings. You can do that. The trial is scheduled. It's set for the 22. "The 22"... this month? Yes. I just have 2 weeks to reconcile them? Yes. - I hope you'll help. - I'd do anything... So do it, for once! OK. I'll help. Your parents built everything together. They'll have to divide it all in half. You have to make them realize, shock them. This is for Dad. Can't we stop this? We've been here 2 hours. Let's have some coffee. For once I agree. No. We're far from done. Whose globe is this? - Mine. - I'm not fighting for that. Globe, Mom. OK. - It's awful. - It's from your mom. - Really? - Yes. - Photo albums? - That's hard. - Depends on the photos. - Yes. What do we do? Half for Mom, half for Dad? You have to chose. - I want to pick the photos. - So do I. So photos are for later. The vase? I gave it to Mom when we were in Venice. We saw a little glass blowing store. You spent hours haggling. We were drinking chianti... We won't go for New Year's. The vase? - It's Mom's. - "Mom's." Great. - The moldy chest? - A little respect, please. That's your grandfather's. - Dad put his toys in it. - You remember? - The chest is... - Dad's. - The chest is for Dad. - I agree. The puppet theater? - It's mine. - No. Mine. - No. Why yours? - Come on. I built it. I made the puppets. You take the puppets, you get the theater. Wait. Some respect. You can't just divide up 40 years of memories. It's true. It's not just wood and chiffon. - It's our whole life. - Yes. Aurélie. It's like Fredo. Who gets Fredo? He was my friend first. People downstairs are waiting. - Who brunches on Wednesday with him? - Stop. Who helped you quit smoking? - It's me, right? - Wait. - Who is your friend, Fredo? - Say it! Who's your friend? Chantal and Albert! They're less exhausting! Aurélie, people are waiting and angry! - Fredo... - What? - I'm disappointed. - Sure. I'll be back. A disgrace! It's disgraceful for a teacher! - What's going on? - You threw stones at my son. - What? - Yes. You threw stones at my son. Show her. Tell her. You threw stones at me. Is that the lady who threw stones? They threw rocks at the bar. And to punish them you threw right back. Bravo. Great teaching methods. It's a misunderstanding. - A misunderstanding. - If that's the case... OK! No way will I send him to a school with corporal punishment. I'll show you "corporal punishment"... Witch. Cuckold. - What did she say? - What? Cuckold. I said: "Cuckold". The Tourtereaux have lost it. Let's go! Hurry up, honey. How does she know I'm cuckold? - No idea. - Did you brag? - No. - How does she know? I don't know! You can't shut your mouth or your fly! - Enough! - Stop! Enough! Enough with your divorce! We can't even play cards! Enough! Divorce, sell it all, and screw you! No, Fredo... Fredo! Fredo! - But... - Fredo! - Really, you know... - What? Fredo! Fredo, calm down. What's this? The Chapuis' burger's party Get the chairs. And the signs? Marcel... where are you going? Marcel? Marcel! Where are you going? - To City Hall. - I'm coming. - Hi. - Can we see the mayor? - What's going on? - I've got 2 words for her. What? - What are you doing? - Bravo. I'm onto your schemes with the Chapuis. Your parents wouldn't be proud of you talking to those people. I have appointments from 2-4pm. Lose that tone. We saw you be born, and changed your diapers. - Yes. Did you authorize their food truck? -They opened a food truck? - On the square. Across from us. It's a food truck... - Fast food! - ...It's there 2 times a week. If you can't compete... We can still sell? So they buy our bar, and you keep your seat. After all we did for this town? You don't do anything, not even the puppets at school. Your daughter discredited the school before even teaching there. If I have to eliminate a class, it'll be hers. I'm embarrassed for you. Come on, Marcel. The whole family's insane. I knew you'd do a lot to get ahead, but to sink this low... Don't talk to me about betrayal. - Hello? - Aurélie? It's Christelle. Yes, Christelle. I wanted to tell you myself. I had to tell the principal. If there are more problems like this, kiss your job goodbye. OK. Understood. Goodbye. Is this phone possessed? I'm calling Aurélie, it says it's disconnected. You're using it wrong. Let me see. You called Émilie, not Aurélie. She can't answer, she died 3 years ago. The phone works fine. It works fine. Where are you going? To the Chapuis'. - Why? - To sell the bar. What? You should be happy. You always said: "Never." Only idiots don't change their mind. We've done enough damage. Wait, Marcel. Do you realize? Throwing stones at kids. As if they hadn't caused enough damage. I've been waiting for a package for 3 weeks. I hope it's not broken. Hi, Judas. Hi. Hi, Marie. I thought you ate organic. Call Bernard. I know you left because of us. Ah, Bernard. Sit down. Sit down. Let's talk business. Shoot. - I'd like a small burger. - Make Marcel a burger. Aurélie! Aurélie! Aurélie, wait! Wait. Can I help? What are you doing? I know what's happening. Christelle doesn't help. I'm on your side. You shouldn't. She's your wife. You don't have to believe me. But I want to help. Imagine, they wanted to put this in the cellar. - It's beautiful. - It's our childhood. Oh my gosh... Leon Bidochon. Give us a lesson, little Leon. Yes, teacher. Goose, geese. Mouse, mice. Tourteral, tourtereaux... What's wrong? Am I that bad? I'm sick of it. They'll just do what they want, they're both selfish. Don't worry. You haven't said your last word. We have to change the décor. I can't have these posters. It's trashy! Like you. - Look at this jukebox. - Ridiculous. Like you. I thought it was bigger. - Eh, honey? - We have to gut it. Like you. Marcel, it needs a lot of work. - And that's expensive. - Of course. And with the revenue the last 2 years... it'll take a while to pay for itself. Really, make an effort. An effort? Here goes: I'll show you to the door and not put my foot up your ass. Is that an effort? He starts again. Come, dear. If I leave I won't come back. Promises... - I'll file a complaint! - You won't. For once a man touched you. Come, honey. What did you do to Odette? Well I lasted 20 minutes. Bravo, Marcel. That face she made... I have a problem with my kitchen. With the fitter. When I turn on the stove, I blow a fuse. - Want some? - Yes. - The omelet is burned and runny. - I like them both. The 1st time we kissed, was after your parents' puppet show. Yes. Tourtereaux Christmas. I remember. We were happy. Very. Until you married Christelle. You wanted a break. - I came back and you replaced me. - She was pregnant. I had to. But I loved you. We haven't been a real couple in years. She has her life, I have mine. - Why don't you break up? - She doesn't want to. For our son, and now for politics. Your parents are the only ones I never thought would divorce. But pride wreaks havoc. - You know what it is? - No. What? You want your mom to forgive him but you still call me Darth Vader. - How do you know? - I have sources. Oh... Richard? Betrayed by your own blood. I'll kill him. Stop. Stop... What? - What are you doing? - Stop. Cindy! Oh, Cindy! I know you're there, answer! Cindy! I was an idiot! How's that? How's that? Ah, Cindy... I was an idiot. I realize now. But that's no reason to be with that moron! Who's that "moron"? Wait, it's... Cindy... - It's 6am... - Who's that? I don't know. It's Christelle! I know it's her! - No. - With a lawyer to prove adultery. - Wait... - The window. Go! - Pas par la fenêtre. - Si ! Hop ! Your tights! - Jump! - It can't be... - Hurry up. - 2 minutes. Mom? - Aurélie, Dad's missing. - What? His bed is still made, his phone is on the mantle. Oh, my God, Aurélie... In 40 years he's never slept anywhere else. - Papa ran away. - OK. Sure. OK. Give me 2 minutes so I can get dressed, OK? - Don't move. - No. Aurélie. - 1.50 E. I gave you one extra. - Thank you. Bye. What are you doing? Give me that. - Hi. - Hi. The usual? Well-done. - Did you see? - What? Marcel ran away. Liliane must have thrown him out. She probably couldn't take the adultery. I get it. She did him in and put the body in the fridge. Bone-chilling. Huh, honey? - Goodbye. Thank you. - Bye. Have a nice day. You're still eating candy? It can't be... Where is he? What happened? - What's going on? - Nothing. - What "nothing"? - Don't touch it, Mom! Can't you see it hurts? I hit myself with a hammer. - Any news on dad? - Not yet. I know he left with his bike, fishing pole, radio, crosswords, clothes, and some food. And? He went fishing. That's it. - You think? - Of course. Albert and Fredo will bring him back, that's it. - They're here. - And? So, Fredo? He's not at the lake or the river. No. Something might have happened. Maybe he was hit by a car, drowned in a river... I don't know. Selling to the Chapuis did him in. I won't say it. So don't. If he had an accident, we'd know. I'm going crazy. Where's the map, let's divide the region. - Where are we? - Here. Don't waste time with that. I'll find him. I know where he goes. OK. Take this photo. to identify him. - This? - Yes. It's 30 years old. - He hasn't changed much. - Uh... - Fredo? - Love is blind. - Uh... - He's handsome. - Did you sleep with her? - And? We don't sleep together. We had an agreement: no affairs in town. I'm sick of it. I want a divorce. We're having lunch with the Chapuis and the MP. I'm sick of the Chapuis and the MP! I'm here because of them. Don't you get it? I'm going. It's over. - What? - I'll move into the office. - What will they say... - I don't give a damn! Only you care! I'm sick of your schemes. Wait for the elections. - Shit, who's this? - I don't know. - Hello. - Hi. Is Christelle here? - Did you hear the news? - No. - Tourtereaux disappeared. - How? A crime of passion. What are you saying? We don't know that. If anything happened to Marcel, it's your fault. - This fixes nothing. - On the contrary. It proves there's nothing with the bar. We'll get it. That's better for your next term. Come on. - Bernard... - Yes. Wait. I'm coming with you. You have to prepare a search. Don't worry, I was a scout. We'll find Marcel with him. I'll stay at the bar. I'll tell the surrounding towns, the hospitals, if he comes I'll be here. Give this to the police. For the lab. - What's this? - DNA. - Do you have news? - No. We're looking for him. I'm coming with you. Geoffrey, go home. I love Grandpa Marionnettes. We'll make 3 groups. An adult with Cindy. Richard, go with Cindy. Go with Fredo. - Come with me, Cindy. - OK. - We also want to help. - That's nice. Thank you. We'll find dear Marcel. - And? - Nothing. No one's at the farm. - In the woods? - No. No one's at the cave. Any news from Chantal? I was right to worry. I knew it. Mom, stop! Sit here. we'll get you later. Are you done talking to me like an old bag? My husband disappeared. And on the show, you know, with the dog, they say the 1st hours are the most important. And it's been over 15 hours since he left. With no news. I tried calling but there's no signal. We didn't look south of the river. No one goes there. Dad took me once. There's a little bridge. This side, Mom. - Come on. - Oh, my... - Is he there? - It's the last place. What's this? Mom? It's him. - It's him! - Don't move. I'll go. Are you sick? What are you doing? We thought... What's this delegation? We thought something happened to you. You should tell us. No! I want to be alone! You wanted me to go, so I left. When I'm there, you want me to go, when I go, you search for me. Women ! Wait. We were terrified, we spent the day looking for you, fearing the worst, and that's your reaction? She slapped me! - Did you see? - I'm off duty. I'll file a complaint. - My attorney's here. - I didn't see. Sellouts. Dad, you're absurd. Come home. No. I have no home. This is my home, now. Happy? You won. Go home. Everyone, go. But Dad... No more "Dad"! Did you hear, Mom? Liliane. Did you see how he spoke to me? What can I say? You think you know someone. It happens. - Richard, I... - I got the message. Thanks. You didn't get it. You should be glad. You got your Prince Charming. - You're an idiot, Richard. - That's true. He's how I got hurt. I thought Aurélie threw the stone. Yes, but... Then I fell off my bike. Geoffrey! Geoffrey! - Good night Liliane. - Bye, Remi. Thanks. Bye, girls. - You're sure you're OK, Mom? - I'll be fine. - Bye, Pierre. Thanks. - Bye. I'm going home. Goodnight. Wait! - Can we talk? - It's not the time or place. - Let's go to your house. - No way. I don't want people to see you at my house. Listen, Pierre. Yesterday was a big mistake. That's it. We gave into an impulse, an old reflex. A passionate encounter, that's an "old reflex"? You're married, Pierre! I can't save my parents' marriage and ruin yours. Excuse me, now. I'm tired. Yes. Good doggie. This is for you. At least you're nice. Yes, Chantal? Wait... What? She's not picking up? Not at the bar? She didn't go to Zumba? OK. I'll call you. Thanks. Mom? Mom? What about your cholesterol? I don't care. You can't leave the bar closed. Think of the customers. I'm sick of serving the town winos. Chantal was worried. You didn't go to Zumba. Don't care. I'm sick of sweating with fatties. Enough drama. Get up and let's go shopping. I don't want to. I'm ugly, my arms are soft. I want to eat candy in bed until death becomes me. Hello? Sorry. I forgot. I'm on my way. They're waiting for me at the town hall. I must go. - Get dressed. - Give that back. Fine. Stay in bed with your candy. Mrs. Chapuis will be happy to see the bar closed. I can hear her telling everyone: "Liliane wants a divorce, but she's screwed alone. "She spends all day stuffing her face in bed." - Did that bitch say that? - Yes. - Really? - She didn't hold back. She'll see what she sees. Come, Cameron. Come with me. Tell them, Geoffrey. I hurt myself when I fell off my bike. Grandma Odette would give me candy if I said it was Aurélie. Aren't you exaggerating? No. Geoffrey wants to say something to Aurélie. - Sorry, Ma'am. - Thank you, Geoffrey. Apology accepted. That is over. Goodbye, Cindy. We're in a hurry. We've been waiting for a half hour. Sorry. I was held up. Another missing person? Should we get the helicopter? Sorry for the chaos we caused, even if we didn't mean to. I love this town. I chose to live and work here, I want it to go well. To apologize, I suggest we have a paella on the square, like the ones my parents did. - Great idea. - That's true. We need entertainment. Impossible. The events budget is gone. Excuse me, but a party has to be planned. Unless you pay everything. That's different. Christelle, she can't organize it alone, so we'll ask everyone to participate. - Yes! - It'll be nice. We'll sell the tickets for 10 E... Then no one will come. Set a good price. OK... Let's say, 7 E, then. We'll take care of the rest. We just need your authorization. You also need lighting. And a minimum security detail, a fence for the cars... That all has a cost. And City Hall won't go into the red to promote your restaurant. Do you know how much this will cost? I can't run it right now, but it's not nothing. - Think about it. - No. I already did. We need tables and chairs. We'll use the dining hall's. We don't use them during vacation. If everyone agrees, I'll give in. Onto the yard sale. Bye, Aurélie. Where are we? Bye. - How much, for the yard sale? - I don't know. Sylvie? We have to talk. Come here. You just told her you were leaving? Yes. Now I know why she's so mad. I have enough problems now, I don't want to be responsible for this. But you aren't. Christelle and I have been over for a while. This is moving a little fast. "A little fast"? We took 10 years. I don't have time. I have to organize a buffet, I don't know where to start. I'll help. - Do you know a printer? - I have my sources. - Not expensive. - Not expensive. "7 E admission"? What do we do with that? That doesn't even pay for the drinks. Ask me first! Since working here, my projects aren't earning money. You want a paella... Who will make the paella? Who does the desserts? Dad's not here, Mom can't do a dessert. I'm doing it to bring them together. - They'll help. - You want them back together? Not a bad idea. Ah! Thanks. Knock it off. Stop! Why do you want them to get back together? You saw what it already cost us? A cruise, a paella... What next? It's enough! You can't make people love each other. You don't get it. They still love each other! They just have to open their eyes. They deserve... this sacrifice. Beautiful speech. Very moving. Hi, everyone. Here's your estimate. Here. What estimate? 300 E to rent the square? Electricity included. You're all insane. - Cancel it. - I will not. Do it without me, then. I've had enough. Just like always. Go. I'll handle it myself. I think he's right. Just cancel. Out of the question. A paella's easy as pie. We've seen others. Fine. Good luck. Good luck. - I'll make a chocolate mousse. - Yes! His mousse is great. You're so nice. We can count on you. - It'll be OK. - It'll be good. - Dad, I want to say... - Shh. The fish don't like talking. Stop being grumpy. I know you're unhappy. Mom, too. - She wanted it.. - Great. - You cheated. - Once. Once in 40 years. Once. Oh, no... I'm better without her. Sorry, but I just don't believe that. Well, what? I didn't have a chance to say I'm glad you're here. And proud of the woman you've become. Strong, independant. Well I need your help. I told the city council I'd hold a paella for the town. Like you used to. Remember? Why? To apologize to people. - There's no point, we're selling. - What about me? I'm a teacher here. No, honey. Ask for anything but that. Oh, no, I'm not setting foot in there. Oh, my... Oh, no. No, stop. No. You do the evens, I'll do the odds. - OK? - Yes. Watch out. Do the Chapuis know you're giving out our tickets? It's not their business. I don't work for them. Oh? Why? - I don't like their methods. - Oh yeah? I'm not doing it for you. It's for your parents, they treated me well. The other day I came, did you see how I was received? Do you want to talk? I'm listening. "Talk"? Here? In the street? In public? I don't like you dating the Chapuis' son. OK? - Why not? - He's not right for you. Who's right for me? A guy like me. You're joking. We broke up because you didn't want a girlfriend. No. You wanted to live together right away. It was too fast. "Fast"? It was 1 year. Romain proposed after 10 days. "10 days"? He's sick! I'm afraid you're with a guy like that. One moves too fast, the other too slow... But 10 days! Tell me you said no. What do you propose? Not marriage, but we could live together. If you want. Is that a yes? My, you're busy, I see. What are you doing? I wondered why you won't help our daughter. I thought, "Maybe "it's the fish you don't catch, "your daily nap." No. I know. You're pouting alone. Is that it? Here it goes... It starts again. Even out here, I can't be alone! Marcel, if you think I'm here for you, you're really dense. Enough! We have to help the kids. We're divorcing, selling... Fine. But we can be classy. Aurélie came here for us. If we don't help her, she'll leave again. And I'll never forgive that, Marcel! Never! Of course. It's my fault again. You're not the only one who cares about her. Well... Give me your arm. Give me your hand. You cut yourself good. Thanks. Don't try to coax me. What's your choice, Marcel? Are you going to sulk alone or come help us? Huh? I'm staying. - We'll never make it. - Chantal, stop! - What? - The shrimp are next. I didn't know paella was so hard to make. Well, if Spaniards manage... Chop the onions. That's why you're blubbering. It's funny. Marcel fries the chicken first. - That's not the recipe. - Forget the recipe! I saw him make it. - Here, Lili. Try the sangria. - So... - Oh, no. -They forgot the soda. Get me 2 bottles of soda. Fredo, 2 kg of oranges. - Yes, boss. Too much lemon. What's this disaster? First you cook the chicken. I told them, they didn't listen. Stop this mess. Help me. Give me that bottle. No drinking. Chantal, stop that. No crying. Come on. You do the tomatoes, OK? Fredo, slice the peppers. - Where's the chicken? - Here. How's this? Good. Keep going. Aren't you busy? You invited 100 people. I don't have a truck for the tables. Where's Richard? They're fighting. Richard? Where are you? We need you. I don't care! We're a family. We fight, we slam doors, but we help each other. Got it? Get your truck, and get the tables with Aurélie. See you soon. What? Get to work! Go! No dilly dallying. What's for dessert? Christian, did you hear? There's voices. Let's make them want to cancel. - That's it. - Shh! It's right there. What's going on? You do it. I can't see without glasses. As mayor if you're caught you can explain. I'm risking my position. It's a man's job. - Think of your election. - Yeah. It's good it's you. So look out. Christian, come see this. Which is the sewage pipe? - That one. - OK. It's done. OK, Bernard, careful. Wait for us. Bernard, wait. What's that smell? Oh my. But... - Stay back. You'll slip. - What's going on? It's a leak. How long will it be? Stay back. I don't know. What happened? - What happened? - It's sewage. There's a plug somewhere. What a mess! - When will it be fixed? - No idea. At least tomorrow. - Tomorrow? - Yes. I have to find the plug. Sorry. That's some bad luck. We'll find a date for your little party. It's bad. - How does this work? - Ma'am! - Do something! - I said to stay back. - It can't be! - I said to stay back! OK, OK... Fix all this. Where can I walk? - This seems sketchy. - You think? What do we do? Eat paella until Christmas. - It feels sketchy. - It feels like Christelle. - Hi, everyone. - The bar's closed. I told her to come. - Do you have the package? - Yes we do. I'm glad. My sister sent it from Spain 3 weeks ago. My new collection. - OK, Marie. - We won't keep you. She's got something interesting to tell you. Go on. - We know her stories. - No. This time, it's good. Last night I heard voices on the square. So I went to the window. I'm not nosy, but with everything going on... - Hurry up. - Can I? I went to the window, and there I saw some shadows. It was in the dark, but I saw Odette Chapuis' pink coat. What? Her pink coat, and Bernard's head. And a blond kneeling down. No one believes me, so I shot a video on my phone. Look, look. Look, look. - That's Christelle Moisan. - Oh, yeah. - Wait... - Everyone should see this! You can see them. - You see them. - Honey, honey... The Tourtereaux' paella will be held at the school. Change of plans: the paella will be held at the school. Come one, come all! Except the Chapuis! Change of plans: the paella will be held at the school. Geoffrey, knives go on the right, forks on the left. - Line them up. - OK. You're a real homemaker. Wow! I like it. I'm joking. Because we're moving in... - Cindy, I'm joking. - He's joking. See? Everyone sees. Uh, go get me more plates. I need some. Richard! - Even angry, I love her. - Stop. You said forks to the left, knives on the right. You haven't finished setting the table. - Hurry up. - Admit you're in love. - How's it going? - We're moving but we won't make it. - You will. - Lili! - Where's the.. - Here. Look. - Thanks. I need the... - Cayenne pepper. Yes. But taste it. - Perfect. Delicious. - I'll make the next one. - How many reservations? - 48. - "48"? - That's not enough. Look at this. Look at all this. Albert, Fredo, we need more reservations. OK. We're on it. Ladies and gentlemen, please evacuate the premises. I'm going to file a complaint. You can't be here. You have 10 min to pack up and go. Aurélie. - Christelle, can we talk? - Go ahead. No. In private. - Yes. That's better. - OK... You have 10 minutes. Follow me? - A drink? - Some sangria? - OK. A small one - OK! What's going on? We're alone. I'm listening. So? I'm risking my position. That's a man's job. Think of your election. Stop whispering. The party's starting. Come help, Christelle. How are you, Thierry? Kids! Who wants a puppet show? Take a seat, ladies and gentlemen. It's starting. Take your seats. - Liliane, Marcel, it's starting. - We've got work to do! After. OK. Come see anyway. Sit here. Lili, sit by Marcel. - Should we call them? - Puppets! Puppets! Puppets! Puppets! Hi, kids! - Hi, friends! - Hi. Hi, Tourtereaux. This story is about a lovebird who met another lovebird. - They were a pair of lovebirds. - Lovebirds are never alone! They always travel in pairs. These lovebirds loved each other 40 years. But one day they started fighting. No more parties, card games, no more laughing at the restaurant. Every night it was angry soup. I'm the cook! Your soup is awful! Ow! Oh, Cameron, my dog! - He's mine. - It's 4:15. It's my turn to pet him. You get tomorrow. He's my dog! And when they fought, they didn't see everyone was sad. Or that the baker and his wife were trying to take their restaurant. If you see the baker and his wife, kids, call me. - I'm counting on you, OK? - OK! - Louder! Can I count on you? - OK! - You'll call me? - Yes! The lovebirds are over. We'll buy their restaurant and throw them out! Guignol! Guignol! He's here! Guignol! What's going on? What are you doing? Go away! Go away! You can't go into peoples' houses like that! Hey, lovebirds. Isn't it time to make up? You have to know when to forgive. Come on, kids! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Bravo! Encore! Encore! Encore! Encore! Did you like the show? I loved it. People seemed happy. Were you happy? I have something to say. Liliane, I've been thinking. I agree to divorce. We'll put the bar up for sale tomorrow. You can't do that. The bar's your life. You're my life. Without you I don't want to keep it. - That's you. - What? You declare your love and then leave me. You wanted the divorce. It starts again. Come here. If you think you're rid of me, you're wrong. Not at all. And our kids bought us a cruise... No, we can do something else. Seasick or not, be at the quai. - Will you stop? - What? - Yelling at me. - I don't yell at you. - You always do. - Really? - A kiss? - No... - Come on. - No! Stop. - Go. - Another kiss. - No. Come on. - One more. Come on! Stop! Get up, there. - Did you tell him? - No... Stop. - You're eating the mike. - What? I thought you were there. I said recess and school, it came out "reschool". - I'm going. - Why didn't you tell me? Why are you laughing? - I'm going. - Why didn't you tell me? Oh, shit... Who's behind the column? Action! Action! Action! Action! Bells are ringing. It's our wedding. Come on, Pierre! Re-do it. I will not send him to a school... Shit! Oh, it's open. Sorry, it's open. Fredo! He's not at the lake or the river. Cut. What? - Re-do. He played a spade. - Sorry. I know.... Subtitling: Eclair Group
