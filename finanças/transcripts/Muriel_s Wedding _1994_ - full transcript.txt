An apprentice locksmith. Oh, that sounds wonderful. Doesn't it, Bill? - [Translating] - A bit old for an apprentice, aren't you? A bit old for everything! After she failed high school, I get her into a secretarial course run by a mate of mine. $300 a term. Two years, $2,000. [Laughs] - She comes out, she can't even type. - I could type. Then I get her a job at me solicitor's. After a month, Stevie Mason rings up and says he'll have to let her go... 'cause she can't type. If I couldn't type, why did they give me my secretarial diploma? Because I paid for it! Sits around the house like a dead weight! Watching TV, sleeping all day, getting arrested at weddings! You're useless. You're all useless. A bunch of useless no-hopers. [Woman] Bill. Bill! - [Bill] It's Deidre Chambers. - What a go! - What a coincidence. Deidre, pull up a chair. - What a coincidence! Penelope, shift out! Deidre, Victor Keinosuke and his mate Akira. - Hello. Hello. - All the way from China... Uh, Japan. - Deidre's a sales representative for Radiant Cosmetics. - Beauty consultant, Bill. Sorry. Beauty consultant. "Sales representative" sounds so common. I advise women on the right lipstick, base and eyeliner. Of course, you'd know all about makeup. Your wives are probably geishas. - [Akira Coughs] - You look lovely, Deidre. Muriel, how was that wedding? - She was arrested. - That's lovely. Don't you wish you were 22 again, Betty? - Remember that age? - Oh, yes. What? I bet you were a terror when you were 22. Bill, was she a terror? Where's Charlie Chan with that food? Oh, yes. Where is he? - [Coins Clanking, Men Speaking Japanese] - [Emcee] Anyone? Oh, wait. - I think we've got a winner over here. - Two new bars through there. - Here she comes.

We won't tell anyone. - [Tania Sniffling] - [People Talking] - Hello. - [Continues Sniffling] [Cheryl] Don't bottle it up, Tania. You've got to let it out. [Janine] You can tell us what happened. We won't tell anyone. He... He couldn't do it. So l... You know. And I noticed there was lipstick on it. - On what? - His dick! He said he was having an affair. [Janine] Who with? Rose Biggs. Rose Biggs? Well, he said they don't sleep together. She only sucks him off. Why? - [Crying] Out of respect for me. - Oh, the bitch. - Bastard. - What am I going to do? I'm a bride! I'm supposed to be euphoric! - [Sniffling] - Come on the holiday with us! - Cash in your ticket to Bali and have your honeymoon with us. - Yeah!

We were going to tell her after the holiday, but I think we should tell her now. - Muriel... - [Cheryl] Wait! Let her finish her Orgasm. [Slurping] [Slurping Continues] [Slurping Continues] [Puts Down Glass, Sighs] Muriel, people think we're mad, but that's just us. We're ragers. People invite us to parties, and they know we'll just have a good time. - We're mad. - Party, party, party. That's our image. You know what I mean. [Laughs] We're mad. We don't want you hanging around us anymore. - I didn't steal the dress. It was a mistake. - It's not the dress, it's you. We've told you a thousand times how to do your hair, but you never listen. - You never wear the right clothes. - You're fat. You listen to '70s music. This is the '90s. - We all listen to the Baby Animals. - And Nirvana. - You bring us down, Muriel. - You embarrass us. L-I know I'm not normal, but I'm trying to change. - I'm trying to become more like you, more of a... - It's too late. - I can change! - You'll still be you. Muriel, you've got to find friends on your own level. Like I found Chook. He's up on my level. Marrying him was... the happiest day of my life. [Sobbing] I love him so much! [Continues Sobbing] That bastard! I'll show him. I'll go on this holiday and I'll sleep with a thousand men! [Crying] I'm not nothing. Muriel, can't you think of anyone but yourself? Tania's upset. - I'm not nothing! [Continues Crying] - Well, nobody said that. Please don't chuck me out of the group! - [Muriel Wailing] - [Laughing] - [Wailing] - Muriel. Muriel, you're embarrassing us again. [Continues Wailing] And Perry kicks! He picks it up! "Go yourself! Go yourself!" Is the roar from the crowd. Heslop! Heslop! Heslop! [Cheering] How can a man be so strong and so fast? Heslop! - Perry! - [Dog Barking] Wake up to yourself! And Heslop's made a comeback! How does he do it? Has he applied for the police force? Yes, but they wouldn't let him sit for the test because he was too tall. Muriel up? Muriel! You've got to get up! It's nearly 10:30! [Bill] Make sure she sees Deidre Chambers about that job. Give her a blank check for cosmetics. - [Betty] A blank check? How much for? - It's a blank check. She fills in the amount when Deidre tells her what it is. And tell Perry to mow that backyard. Clean the place up. It's a pig sty. [Betty] Joanie, will you turn off that television and clean this place up? It's a pig sty. Muriel, you have to get up and go and see Deidre Chambers about that job, and I have to give you a blank check. [Joanie] Have you seen my smokes? It's wonderful for Deidre to give you work. She's a wonderful person. I don't care what anyone else says. - Mum? - What who says? All those people who've never liked Dad. Those greenies and those terrible women at the post office. What are they saying? Do I make this out to Deidre Chambers or Radiant Cosmetics? A blank check. Cash. What are they saying about Deidre and Dad? They say that they go driving at night, but he's only showing her his developments. His what? His building sites. [Tears Off Check] I'm going to be a success, Mum. I'm going to get married, and I'm going to be a success. I know you are. Your dad just wants to be proud of you, that's all. I'll show him. I'll show them all.

Peter Vernell. - Oh, I remember them. What a pair of assholes. They deserve each other.

Well, we can't let you spend the entire holiday alone. We're not in school anymore, Rhonda. You don't have to feel you're not good enough for us now. - I don't. - If I feel you've changed, I'll tell you. I'm honest... unlike some people. - I tell it like it is. - The truth? - Yes. - I tell the truth too. Nicole's having an affair with Chook. Muriel saw them fucking in the laundry on your wedding day.

Maybe it was a mistake at the bank... or I wrote the wrong figure on the check. No, I took it. Yes, maybe you did. - [Knocking] - Mum, the Federal Police are here. Oh, I have to go. We're being raided again. What's your phone number? - Uh, I don't have a phone. - Well, what's your address? - Look, I'll call you later. - Ring Dad. He's at the Hilton. Mrs. Heslop, we want to ask you some questions about Bill. And don't lie to us. We know everything. [Doctor] This tumour is pressing on the spinal cord, interrupting the flow of electricity to your legs. The operation will remove that pressure. I'd, uh, like to do it soon, in the next 24 hours. [Exhales] How did I get it? I mean, it's nothing to do with too much sex, is it? - [Doctor Chuckling] No, no, nothing like that. - [Rhonda, Muriel Sigh] - We don't know what causes cancer. - Cancer? - Cancer? - [Rhonda] You never said anything about cancer. - That's what the tumour is. - It's a... - I've got cancer! Oh, God! I'm going to go bald and have to eat macrobiotic food! We're not talking about radio therapy. This is a discreet tumour. Alone. Isolated. - The operation's all we need for the moment. - "For the moment"? There's a minor risk of damage to the spinal cord. - What does that mean? - It means I'm up shit creek, that's what it means. [Traffic Passing] [Distant Siren Wailing] Silk Chantel. [Sighs] Imported. When's your big day? Your wedding day? - September. - Spring. Ivory. - What's your fiancé's name? - Bill. [Sighs] Well, Bill's in for a big surprise. [Laughs] - Will your mother be coming to see the dress? - No. No, she can't. She's in a hospital. She's got a tumour in her spine. She has to have an operation. We don't usually do this. But your mother has to see how beautiful you look in that dress. [Woman] You're doing well. Isn't she doing well, Mariel? - You're doing really well. - Now this foot forward. - You can do it. - [Sighs, Sniffs] Good. Now the other one. [Shuddering] Good. That's good. And... [Clears Throat] I have to sit down. [Sniffs] - Come on. - [Loudly] I have to sit down! All right, I've got you. Don't panic. Swing around. - [Sighs] - [Therapist] That's it. - Hand back. - [Exhales] Take a break, honey. - [Panting] - You're doing really well. [Crying] How can you stand this? You push me around in this chair. You cook for me. You even help me dress. I hate it! [Crying] When I lived in Porpoise Spit, I'd just stay in my room for hours and listen to Abba songs. - Sometimes I'd stay in there all day. - [Inhales] But since I've met you and moved to Sydney, I haven't listened to one Abba song. It's because now my life's as good as an Abba song. It's as good as "Dancing Queen." - Come off it. - [Exhales] [Sniffs, Sighs] Promise me something. We never go back there. - What do you mean? - I mean I can't go back and live in Porpoise Spit with Mum. - Not in a wheelchair. Not with her. - [Sighs] You're going to walk. Promise we never go back. - I promise. - [Sniffs] You're going to walk.

Why didn't you tell me you were going to marry Tim? - Who? - Tim Simms, your fiancé, the one who wants to shoot you. Now, now, now, now, just a minute. You can't come in here and threaten brides. - I don't care how unfortunate you are. - Fuck off! - Oh! - What is going on, Mariel? I've seen your wedding album. You've tried on every dress in Sydney. - That doesn't mean I'm getting married. - What else does it mean? [Sighs] I want to get married! I've always wanted to get married. - If I can get married, it means I've changed, I'm a new person. - [Rhonda] How? Huh, because who would want to marry me? - Tim Simms. - There is no Tim Simms. I made him up. In Porpoise Spit, no one would even look at me. But when I came to Sydney and became Mariel, Brice asked me out. That proves I'm already different than I was. And if someone wants to marry me, I'm not her anymore, - I'm me. - Her? Muriel! Muriel Heslop! Stupid, fat and useless! I hate her! I'm not going back to being her again. [Crying] Why can't it be me? Why can't I be the one? [Muriel Crying] - [Crying Continues] - Have you been in a coma? [Sobbing] [People Chattering] [Horn Honking, People Laughing] [Ringing] Rhonda? Dad. [Diners Talking Softly] [Lawyer] If they have a copy of this document, then the option is... giving you a doctor's certificate saying you are unfit to testify. Uh, can I have that title deed, Paul? That's the one. We can only assume that Victor Keinosuke has given them a copy of this deed. Muriel, why'd you do it to me? I gave you money. I got you jobs. I put her through this secretarial course. $2,000 for two years it cost me. She comes out, she can't even type. I get her into selling cosmetics. We all think she's making a go of it. Turns out, she's robbing us blind. You're a disgrace, an absolute disgrace! A-Are you Bill the Battler? I saw you on TV. Can I please have your autograph? - Me and my dad think that you're not guilty, Bill. - I've changed my name to Mariel. Good on you, son. You spread it around. - [Boy Shouts] You can't stop progress! - [Chuckles] You're coming back to Porpoise Spit with me. We'll leave in three weeks, once this inquiry crap's over. - I can't go back. I'm a new person. - You're a thief! The only reason I never got the coppers onto you is your mother begged me not to. I want that money back. I'll get you a job at the Leagues Club. I'll arrange a bank loan for you. You're going to make up for what you've done, Muriel. It's Deidre Chambers. Deidre? Deidre. Hey, Deidre! Bill! [Laughs] What a coincidence. What are you doing in Sydney? Well, my sister lives in Sydney. - I'm down for the long weekend. What a coincidence. - Pull up a chair. My barrister, Graham Newman, his two solicitors, and Muriel you know about. It's Mariel! We should get back, Bill. Victor Keinosuke's testimony starts at 3:00. That Jap bastard! He's going to testify that I took bribes from him. - Commissions. - Commissions. I took commissions. I cut through all that red tape for him. I deserve some sort of acknowledgement. They'd never have got to build that resort on Crown Land without me. It was the Crown Land that did it. - Total overreaction. - There were Aboriginals living on it. [Bill] The Federal Police raided the house. Your mother just let them walk in. - She and Perry made statements, told them I had money problems. - Don't think about it. Of course I had money problems. She stole most of it. [Deidre] You need your family around you. - [Bill] If the feds come near you, don't you say a word. - Are you and Deidre together? What? Have you left Mum for Deidre? [Sighs] Yes. We're in love. What about Mum? [Inhales] What happiness has your father had in his life if he doesn't have me? - What about Mum? - She'll have you. You've got three weeks. [Key Turning In Lock, Door Opening] [Door Closing] It's come back. The tumour. I have to have another operation. I'm not going to walk. But... [Sighs] What about your rehabilitation? They're going to cut my spinal cord, Mariel. Mum called. She wants to take me back to Porpoise Spit. I told her I was going to stay here with you. [Coach Yelling] Head down! Head down! Come on! Come on! Swing it! Blokes with no legs and no arms cut through the water faster than that! [Woman Talking, Coach Continues Yelling] Flopping around all over the place! Burchett, what do you think this is? Synchronized swimming? Water aerobics for geriatrics? You're supposed to be a sprinter! Go, go, go, go! Mariel? Ken Blundell. - How are you? - [Laughs] [Blundell] Van Arkle! I think we found you a girl. David Van Arkle, Mariel Heslop. Mariel, you've probably seen the news about the civil war in South Africa. Well, just as the South Africans seem to be doing the right thing by the blacks, the police open fire on a black soccer club and that is bad news for David. Are you black? What? [Laughing] I don't know why I said that. Well, it is funny in a way. But let's be honest. The South Africans were never much chop in the pool anyway. David here is a bit of a freak really. And I think that he is going to get the gold medal... - for the 1,500 metres in the next Olympic Games. - [Gasps] Mariel, how did you feel when Kieren Perkins took gold for Australia at Barcelona? [Sighs] Who? Kieren Perkins. He's an Australian champion. Now David's family are willing to do anything... to see him fulfill his potential as a champion. Even if it means swimming for another country. And they're willing to pay $10,000... to the girl that'll help Dave out. Are you from Sydney originally? What? No, Porpoise Spit. A-And why did you leave there? Well, because of all the mental things that happened to me. I got shallow. And my physical being could have been improved, and, as well as my mentality. - What about the black-haired one? - No, she was Turkish. She'd only been in the country five minutes. Now, whoever marries David... will have to tell the immigration authorities that they're in love with him. Now, there will be media attention, so they'll have to live with David in his flat... for at least four months after the marriage. I've worked out all the details of the romance, which you and David will have to stick to. But the most important thing is to convince people that you two are really in love. - What about the blonde? - You didn't like her. - I'm not so sure now. - Now I think Mariel might be just what we're looking for. Well, it's up to you now, love. Would you find it difficult to lie? I could try. Well, don't rush your decision, but if you could let us know by tomorrow morning. ♪ [Playing "Dancing Queen"] ♪ [Humming Along] - ♪ Ooh, ooh ♪ - [Quietly] ♪ Ooh, ooh ♪ - ♪ You can dance ♪ - ♪ You can dance ♪ - ♪ You can jive ♪ - ♪ You can jive ♪ - ♪ Having the time of your life ♪ - ♪ Having the time of your life ♪ - ♪ Ooh, see that girl ♪ - ♪ Ooh, see that girl ♪ - ♪ Watch that scene ♪ - ♪ Watch that scene ♪ - ♪ Dig in the Dancing Queen ♪ - ♪ Dig in the Dancing Queen ♪ ♪ [Organ Playing "Ave Maria"] [People Chattering] ♪ Ave Maria ♪ ♪ Gratia plena ♪ I know you couldn't have got up onto the altar, - but at least she could have asked you to be bridesmaid. - ♪ Maria ♪ - She did. - Why didn't you say yes?
