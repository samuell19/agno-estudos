(letters whooshing) (floorboards creaking) (camera thunks) (electricity sizzling) (bright music) (dramatic music) (church bells tolling) (horse harnesses jingling) (people chattering) (tense music) (people chattering) (groceries thudding) (ominous music) (crickets chirping) - Well, don't you look like a bundle of fun! So you're old school Defense Force. All that knowledge out there and you limit it with one book. - A lot of rubbish is sold as knowledge. I choose to be careful where I get mine! - You brought a message into town for the Defense Force. What is it? - You the boss? (dramatic music) - What is the message? This isn't like the other cities, a little picking here and there and then we move on. It may take us days or even months but when it's weak. (twigs cracking) We're not leaving until this city's finished! - That's spooky! (bright music) (people chattering) (horse harnesses jingling) (ominous music) - Somebody call the fire company! - Help, we need water! - Hurry, help! Help, help, hurry! Help! - Is there anyone in there? - There's six or seven, but the door's jammed shut! - Okay, let's do it together, one, two three! What about the fire company? - They're down on Third Street, they won't be able to make it! - It's not budging! Here, help me with this! - Hey, everybody get back, they're trying to get through the door! - One, two, three! (door thudding) (door cracking) Wait, let me go in, I used to work for the fire company! (dramatic music) There's no people, there's no furniture, there's no nothing, (gasping) the building's empty! (somber music) (people chattering) - Tough luck, I call it. - Probably been too long. (knuckles rapping) (door creaking) - Hi, Alec. - Hi. - I'll get Elsie. What happened to you? - There was a fire down at the Quarter. - Tell me you didn't go in. If you get hurt again, Alec, there's no one to take care of your sister. - There was no luck on jobs today. - Nothing even promising? - Oh they all try to be nice. Did seem a little stiff at Richard and Sons. - The paperhanger? Bet that stirred the talk around town. - Yeah, I probably stirred it up more down at the fire. Came out of the building, got a bit emotional. What do you expect? You lost your arm and almost your life last time you fought a fire. Oh, if you'd have gotten here earlier, I had a notice for an opening on Crown Street. - What time does it close? - 15 minutes, I think. - I could take the back way. - Nothing good happens down there. - I'll be fine, you mind watching Elsie again? - Sure. - Thanks. Love you, Elsie. (gentle music) (bell tolling) - I'm gonna ask you again. What is the message? - Help! - Quiet! - Hey, what's going on down here? - Why don't you find another way around? - Hey, is that a Defense Force agent? - I said, move along! (tense music) We've got to get him out of here. There's too many people around. You are trying my patience. - You're trying my patience too. - Yeah, mine too. - I'm gonna ask you one last time. What's the message? (blow thuds) (Boss thuds) (dramatic music) Do not let him get to the Defense Force! - What do they want? - Right now, you and me! (thugs grunting) Quick, in here! Get in! (footsteps thudding) - I saw a guy in a mask like that at a building fire today. - Keep talking. - Thing was, there was no fire. Just lots of smoke. When it cleared, everything was gone, desks, chairs, people, everything. - They must be up to something new. Got to get this message to the CDF. And you might have a better chance. - You want me to get it to the Defense Force? - The front entrance is guarded. There's a back way. CDF boat waiting down at Front Street. They can get you there. Give it to the chief. - "Raiders coming, New Haven next target"? - It's not just that, you need to tell them about the smoke and masks. This is not a normal raid, either. They seem to have bigger plans for the city. You should join the CDF. - Yeah, I'm not sure they'd take me. Plus, I've got a little sister to watch out for and not sure this would be the best job for that. - Everyone will be involved before this is over. If you join, this is invaluable. - Just gonna get the message through for now. - Keep it, if I'm caught, they'll throw it away, anyway. (footsteps tapping) (dramatic music) - I heard something! (door squeaking) Is that a doily? - Okay, that's creepy! (debris clattering) (seagulls squawking) (water lapping) (door squeaking) (engine puttering) - Wait, I've got a message for the Defense Force! - Who are you? - I have a message that must get through to the Defense Force! - Hey, I didn't give you permission to come on board! You don't look like an agent to me. - I'm not, but one of your agents gave me this message before he was captured. - Run! - There's your agent! - That thing in the doily? I guarantee you that's not one of our agents. - Inifatige! (engine puttering) - Got you, one armed man! (Alec groaning) - Hey, what did I miss? There's the one-armed guy! What? (dramatic music) I think he'll make it. (water splashing) - You know you wanted to do that. (engine puttering) - Were those raiders? What's with the masks? - Something new, I guess. Have you dealt with these raiders before? - They're the main reason for the CDF. Haven't seen much of them here, but they've been a real problem in the other cities. - Why haven't I heard of 'em before? - We fight them mostly behind the scenes. Keeps people from worrying. - Boat coming in! - What's inifatige? You know, the thing that your agent said? - Emergency passcode. Whatever your message is, it must be important. (gentle music) - Peter! - I forgot. Bag's under the seat. - Why can't you be more like Eddie? He always signs in and out. It's not that hard. - Eddie never leaves his boats. I'm in and out all day long. - Who are you? - Oh, I'm Alec, I think I need to sign in. - Where did you get that book? - He has a message for the chief. It's inifatige. - Let's see it. - I think I'll give it to the chief. - You can give it to me. - Louise, let's get it to the chief. - Sign out when you leave! (clock ticking) - Where did you get this? What did the raiders look like? Did you see their faces? Do you know anything else about the smoke? I need details. Alec? How about the raiders themselves? - I think that's it. - So what do you think? What are they up to? - I don't know. But the raiders are here. Call an all-hands meeting. (people chattering) - Let's sit here. - That didn't go very well. - Chief's in! - Just how he is, very smart and a great person. - He's also kind of short. - Okay, everyone, I'll get right to the point. The raiders are here. Some are wearing masks and might be tied to the smoked-out buildings. - You're in my chair. - Gas masks, maybe for the smoke. We need to find out what's going on and stop them. - Alec, this is Carson. - Hi. - Shouldn't have civilians on base. - Alec, would you please stand? Our agent was captured, Alec got the message through. We owe him our thanks. (Carson clapping) Have the boats ready to move at all times. That's all. (Louise whispering) (dramatic music) Hold it, everyone! Lou. - Building's just been hit on First Street. All the occupants are missing. - What's the address? - 1325. - Okay, everyone, let's get to it! Let's find some clues. - You okay? - Why are they hitting buildings? What do they want, and where are they operating from? (somber music) - What are you doing? - Got to get to the orphanage! - Got someone there? - Please, Pete! - I'm sorry, they're gone. The force will send out a boat to investigate. We'll find out what to do from there. Maybe there will be some way for you to help, but right now you gotta let us do our job. - Carson, this one's yours. - Yes, Sir! - Eddie, how about boats? - Okay, boats two and three are out. I'll get one moved over to the second slip right away. - Are there any questions? - I want to help. I want to join. - Come on, sit down. This isn't what I meant. - It is not the time for this. - My sister was in that building. I want to join. - I'm sorry for your loss, but we are done here. Get that boat moving! - You've got to let me join! I want to help stop the raiders! - You lost someone you love, I can understand that, but you are wholly unsuited for this job. - What do you mean? - Outside of your limitations, I assume you don't have much schooling. This is an elite force, years of education and experience. - Hey, come on. You couldn't even get your life jacket on. Let it go. - Hey, Carson, get that boat moving! - Yes, Sir! - I'll be at your door every day, I'll follow your boats! - No. - If you don't let me join, I'll fight the raiders on my own! - He did get the message through. - You want him? - No, I'm just saying-- - He's all yours. - You're about to get the speech. - Hey, Alec! - Told ya. - Alec? Learning, education, knowledge, these are what empower us. These are what define our success. If you are to succeed here, it will be because you are always learning. These books, these books are your life blood. Know them inside and out. Study them and restudy them. - Are they tactical? - Yes, but they're much more. A wealth of philosophies that don't just shape what we do but who we are. - Your agent gave me this book. He said it was invaluable. Do you know what it is? - This is our old training manual. It was okay for its time but very out of date now. I wouldn't spend too much time with it. If you want to grow, keep your focus here. You're in barracks three at the bottom of the stairs. Pete will start your training in the morning. - Thank you. - It's not a special needs class, Alec. If you slow us down even a little bit, you're out of here. Do you understand? - Yes, Sir. (gentle music) (Alec sniffing) - There was nothin'. Just an empty building. It's fine for tonight, but I don't want to see any tears in the morning. (Alec sniffing) - Heard what Carson said. It's tough. But in a way he's right. We've got a job to do. Gotta put it behind ya, and get to work. (gentle music) - Hey, watch the dock! (people chattering) (engine puttering) - Hey, you and Baxter backin' 'em up. - So far, not seein' it. - Didn't even look. - I looked, but I'm not seeing anything. (people chattering) - Got a lot to cover, get dressed. Eddie's waiting for you out at the boat dock. (engine puttering) - No, you can ask him, I didn't ask for the job. - Oh, two inches. - Just load up, real quick. - You done crying? - Morning, Carson. - You don't get to wear that hat till ya prove yourself. - At the door. - I thought someone was supposed to fix that? - Bring it down slow. - Load two out. - This one fits better anyway. (engine puttering) (bright music) - Hey, stay out of my stuff! - Hi, I'm Alec. - I know who you are. Let's get to work. - What is this? - I have no idea, it was before my time. All right, let's get things going! These boats are your primary transportation. You need to know the specs, design, capacity, speed, limitations. You're gonna need to know how to pilot it, that means drive. (target clicking) - You're up next. Pull it back, put the dart in, shoot it at the target. - This ought to be fun. (target clicking) - You know, you could follow me around and hand me my ammo. (target clicking) (bell ringing) - That dart has a chemical compound that's released on impact. If it hits a person, it causes a temporary paralysis. I wouldn't put it in your mouth. - Do clothes or masks stop it? - No, pretty much goes through everything. Better get to tactics. (gentle music) - There's smoke coming out of a two-story building. Raiders are seen at a nearby house. Our agents are here and here. How do we approach it? - Shetland set up, but close A gap to provide additional cover. Lock down until raiders' first move. If exit from front, close out. If from rear, and we're not seen, recon for potential leads on their base. - Excellent, Carson. Leads to their base are very important. (Alec snickering) - We could send Lou in. - Mr. Alec, you will refrain from comments until you actually know something. - Shetland set up? - Basic tactics, you gotta learn this stuff. - I meant that in a complimentary way. Just seems like you'd do very well with the raiders, with your aggressive, confrontive qualities. That's a very nice scarf. - I guess you don't know what stop means. - I don't think she likes me. - She's been around a long time and usually a good judge of character and knows more about the raiders than anyone. - Who are the raiders anyway? What do they want? - Best guess is money or power. - Who runs them? - Far as we know, no one's ever seen him. (dramatic music) - I wouldn't do that! - I did it. (door clicking) - From New Haven, Sir. - Thank you, Lieutenant. Why the souvenirs? - It helps keep it personal. Did the Force get the message through? - They're starting to respond to our movements. - Did they figure out it's about the people? Doesn't appear so. - Can you read, Lieutenant? (thugs giggling) - Sorry, Sir. (thugs laughing) - Let the Force feel like they're doing somethin'. Throw them a bone or two. (dramatic music) - Glad to, Sir. - Aw, come on! - We'll get you back. - It's humiliating! - We'll get you back. - Yes, Sir. (door creaking) - How ya doin'? - Glad for a bit of a break. - Hit on King Street! Pete, Carson, this one's yours! Don't take the boat, it'll be faster on foot. - You're with me, you're watching this time. Eddie, it's time for you to see the world! - I don't want to see the world! - Eddie, let's go! - Ever, Lou, I'm not supposed to leave my boats. - Your boats will be here when you get back. - Why are you doing this to me? I don't even know what I'm doing! (dramatic music) (crossbow clicking) (body thudding) - We just shot Carson! (bright music) - It was a mistake, okay? - We just shot Carson. - I told them to leave me with my boats. I told them, I said, "Leave me with my boats!" What a mess! - You think you got us! - They did get us! - Lou, we've got some prisoners! Where do you want them? - They did get us, but there'll be other. - Put 'em in the brig! - Plenty of others. - Who are you thinkin' of? - Others! You can't put me in here with him! I demand solitary confinement! Put me down, with this! - I'll give you the cup! - Help! - Where's Pete and Carson? - Guard! - Carson, what happened here? - You were supposed to carry your end! - It got heavy. - The raiders got him? - They didn't get him, they did. - What do you have to say for yourselves? - I think his back is gonna need some lotion. (Alec sighs) (dramatic music) (Alec sighs) - Get your stuff, you're done here! - It was an accident. - How about laughin' through tactics and reading that instead of the books I gave you? - I got laughing and I couldn't stop. I'll read the books. Please, just give me another chance. - Pete, Lou, what do you think? Another chance? - No. - Yes. - His work speaks for itself. - He'll wake up in an hour and be fine, which you probably should think about. I do know we couldn't have caught both the raiders without Alec. He made a bad situation okay. - Last chance, I won't risk lives or the city. Do you understand? - Yes, Sir. (dramatic music) (class applauding) - You've reached the 25-mission milestone, good job. - I had my doubts, but I have to say I've never seen anyone more dedicated to the work. You're not there yet, but we're proud of your effort. A job well done. - Thank you, Sir. (triumphant music) - You earned this. Glad you're part of the team. - You know, I think I'm attached to my other one, but thanks. (class applauding) (people chattering) - Good job. - Congratulations. - Good job. - Congratulations. - Well done. (people chattering) (target clicking) - Hey, maybe you should follow him around and hand him ammo. Hey, Pete. - You look kinda down. (somber music) - Do you ever get that feeling, like, despite all our efforts, the city's changing? Colder, darker? - We're doing okay. You should lighten up. - Yeah, you're probably right. (gentle music) - Give him some more TNTs. - Sir? - Yeah, what can I do for you, Alec? - I was wondering about taking a day or two of leave. - That would be fine. - Thank you, Sir. - Make sure to sign out with Lou. (gentle music) (knuckles rapping) - Gonna go take a few days' leave. Need to sign out. - You think you're doing great, don't you? Everyone else may be sold on you, but I'm not! (Alec groaning) (dramatic music) - What exactly's going on here? How did you get back on base? - I'm just trying to figure out who's been messing with my stuff! Look, every day a new bookmark appears in a different section of this book. - And what do the sections say? - I don't know, I'm just tryin' to figure out who's been putting them there and why. - You signed out and were on base without permission! - Alec, Chief needs you in his office right away! - This isn't over. I will see you outta here! - Took too long for you to get us back this time! - Yeah, we were almost to Division! - We got you back, that's all that matters. - Hey. - Now listen! Boss wants you to take this one. I demand you do the job right. No messing up, utmost seriousness. Is that understood? - Yes, sir. - Yes, sir. - You may find your stuff cute, but I don't. You're gonna get in, you're gonna get the job done, and you're gonna get out, nothing else! Now get moving! - Yes, sir. (door thuds) (door clicks) (bright music) - Lieutenant! - Sorry, Sir. (door squeaking) - The hole's cut, you can shove up the pipe! Did you hear what I said? You can shove up the pipe! (dramatic music) - Wait, what is that? - There's nothing to see here, okay? There's nothing to see here! It's just a pipe with smoke pouring out of it! Just return to your little lives, you didn't see anything! Just don't tell anyone, yow! - He's standing in the middle of the street. People are everywhere, smoke is pouring out of it. (sighs) They broke the trap door. We can't get it closed, the tunnels are exposed. (tense music) (dramatic music) You want us to blow the building? - They must not find those tunnels! - Yes, Sir. (people chattering) - So, I don't really know what to do about it. - Yeah, it's just one of those things. - Probably time to head back. (dramatic music) - I want an explanation-- - Raiders! - Of exactly what happened here! - Well, outside of the smoke and the trap door, I thought things were going according to plan. - Still keeps comin' out! - Hey, I've had about enough of this! - So have we. Yeah, try being us. - I don't much care for fixing your mistakes! - We can tell. - It's only half-hearted work! We should tell the boss. - Get that box around back, you're with me. (box rattling) (fuse hissing) (dramatic music) - Pete, it was explosives! They were trying to blow the building! Pete? - Hey, in here! (door squeaking) They were trying to cover this! You won't believe what's down here. - Sir, I think we got a lead. We found a hidden tunnel going away from one of the smoked-out buildings. It was full of all the things from the building. - Doesn't look like they wanted the stuff. Maybe just the people. Wasn't just one tunnel either. Lots from all over the city leading to the river. That's where they end. - Excellent work, this might be our big lead. - One-armed man? Could be on to us. He's fallen in line with the rest, let it ride. - Yeah, what's a one-armed man gonna do. - Better be safe, call in a favor. - Yes, Sir. - Lead on the tunnel was significant. We need you to follow it up, upriver. It's a bit of a shady area, but there might be someone that will give us some information. Whatever it takes, you need to find the source. - Yes, Sir. (engine puttering) - Hey, where are they going? - They're heading upriver. - Pete, you need to wait! - Pete, you need to go. - Yes, Sir! - Lou, settle it down. - Sir, I need to talk to you about something! (people shouting) (water splashing) (engine puttering) (people shouting) - Do you want some root beer? - Yeah, root beer! (people chattering) - Hey, get out of there! That's my food! - Yay, more root beer and ginger ale! (people laughing) (people chattering) - We've got problems. - I didn't even think anybody noticed us. - Exactly, something's wrong. Wait over by the stove. When I give you the signal, kick the pipe free. (people chattering) (tense music) - You knew we were coming, didn't you? - Yeah. - I guess there's no information, is there? Who tipped you off? (tense music) Well, isn't this pleasant. Now, Alec! (dramatic music) (blows thudding) (glass crashing) (water splashing) (glass crashing) (blow thudding) (door creaking) (bright music) (door thudding) - Hey, did you hear that? (door thudding) Get that door open! (dramatic music) - Hey, a little help here! - Hey, get a rope! That is it? That is all that's left? - Sorry, Eddie, the boat's gone. We barely made it out. - Hey, Chief wants you two in his office right now! (tense music) - We have protocols here that will not be broken! - Indications point to you working as a spy. - Someone tipped them off, but it doesn't make sense that it was Alec. - It wasn't, all I was trying to do was-- - Quiet, the situation has been explained. You broke into the base, nothing further is needed. Lou. - Your termination is effective immediately, and you are hereby banned from all Force facilities. A breach of these orders will result in imprisonment. - Take him away. - I told you it was about the bookmarks! - You need to listen to him! You're making a mistake! - You need to trust me, it's the right thing. - Pete, I'm not the spy, which means someone else is! Watch yourself! I already told you about the bookmarks! It doesn't even make sense! - Hey, what's the matter with you? (crickets chirping) (Alec sighs) (dramatic music) (bell ringing) (crossbow clicking) (gentle music) - What's going on? - Sit down and listen. - Lou, you had me kicked out! You had me kicked-- - Sit down and listen. - You had me kicked out! (crossbow clicks) - Are you gonna listen? 'Cause I have no problem shooting you again. - I'm listening. - You discovered something important with the tunnels. Someone's trying to have you taken out. It's not me. - So you had me kicked out to save me? Then who's the spy? - I don't know. Winston thinks they might be local, but it could be someone up at Division. (dramatic music) - You're the one behind the bookmarks! - I was trying to get you to read the book. - I'm always reading! I'm always studying! - You're always studying the new books, tactics, which are fine if you can see the big picture. But if you can't, you're just more useful to the enemy. This book is not like the other books. The force was strong back when we focused on the book. We could see behind the raiders' plans. Now with the other books everything's become cloudy. Everything except our feeling of intellectualism. Patting ourselves on the back while the city grows colder and darker. - I used those exact words with Pete. You really think a book could make that much of a difference? Do the raiders know about it? - There's other things in those tactics books that are subtle. They aren't there by accident. The enemy knows that if something's based on the wrong ideas, it's only a matter of time until it collapses. You may not see it, I know if we don't get back to the book, it's over. - I know the city is slipping. "If you join, this is invaluable." That's what the agent said to me. Where do we go from here? - Well, it's up to you. Could walk away, or you could let me retrain you with the book. Might get you back with the Force, maybe sway the others like Pete. We might even have enough time to turn the tide on the raiders. - I'm in, so what's the plan? - Glad you're in, Alec. Well, let's start with reading the book. - By the way, why is my back so sore? - Well, I had to drag you several blocks. - And my head? - And there were a few stairs. (gentle music) (door clicking) - Followed? - Maybe. - When you said you were gonna look for raiders, I thought you meant hours, not days. - I followed a lead, it just took a while. Grab your stuff, we gotta go. How'd it go? - Book's been good. No magic moments, though. To be honest, it's felt a little slow. - It's not an instant solution. The more you read, the more you'll see its depth. - What are you doing? - I thought we just read the book, right? - We need things like tactics but you've got to separate the facts from the rubbish. Actually, you can pitch that one. When you see the author hates the book, get what you need somewhere else. - So what's your lead? - Raiders are gonna turn the city. When they think it's weak enough, they make their big move, take what they can and burn it to the ground. I wish we had more time, but I gotta get you back on now. - Winston made it pretty clear, if I step back on base, I'm going to prison. - Let me handle that. - That didn't go so well. - Winston said he'll review the facts when he gets back. The Force was called out on an urgent mission. He said he couldn't take any risks, I'm sorry. - Lou. - Howdy, Eddie. - I'm not supposed to talk with you. - You know, I don't think these work as well on someone with one arm. (dramatic music) (knuckles rapping) - Hey, I'm supposed to knock! - No, I'm supposed to knock. - You're supposed to talk and I'm supposed to knock. - No, I was supposed to knock and Boss said for you to talk! - No, he didn't! - Yes, he did! - No, he didn't! - I'm gonna knock on you! - He told me to, ow! He told me to knock and you to-- - I'm supposed to knock and you're supposed to talk! - We've got problems. - Let him out, Eddie! - Yes, I am! - No, you aren't! - Ow, you're making a scene! - Eddie, you're here, Lou, up above. - I don't care if I'm making a scene! Just let me knock! - I won't, I'm gonna fly at you and you won't know what hit you! - I know exactly what hit me, it's you! - Just quit the pushing! - They have a cannon. - We don't even know if anybody's home. Hello, anybody in there? (crossbow clicking) - Looks like they're home. - Is everyone set? Stay under cover until they start coming through. - I never shot one of these before. - You shot Carson. - Not by myself. - You'll do fine, point and shoot, at the raiders. - If it was up to me, I would have left ya. (cannon booming) - That would be the door. (dramatic music) (crossbows clicking) - Eddie, Eddie, come on, we need you! You can do it, Eddie! (crossbow clicking) (bright music) - Lou, are you seein' this? Eddie's not goin' down! Darts aren't working, let's charge him! (Alec grunting) (crossbow clicking) - Sir, we can't get past the half wall. - Only the mechanic was supposed to be here. - Well, you missed that one. - Time to move to plan B. - That'd be me. - Try and save the cannon. - Yes, Sir. (crickets chirping) (crossbow clicking) (raider grunting) (bright music) - I think we're clear! (crossbow clicking) - I think you kind of like that. Hey, hold up. Do you have any idea what happened to Eddie? - I used a short-term dart on you at the hideout. But these don't seem to have any effect at all. Must have lost their potency. (dart thuds) Or maybe not. - Feeling okay, Eddie? - Yeah, I feel great. - Well, looks like we've got a cannon. - Force is back. (gate rumbling) - Winston. - What happened here? - Well, there's a pile of raiders and we're holding cross bows. - What is he doing out? - I let him out, and it was a good call. If it wasn't for him, you would not have a base. - He's right, you wouldn't have a base. (gentle music) - All right, you're reinstated. I thank you for your actions today, but you're on probation. - Seems like he's always on probation. - Pete, keep an eye on him. - I'll keep an eye on him too. - Let's get this cleaned up. Let's get that door fixed. - There's also a cannon and more raiders out front. I think I need a nap. Whoa. - Eddie, hey, Eddie? - What's the matter with him? - He got hit by a lot of darts today. I didn't think they had any effect on him. Must have just been delayed. I don't work for 'em, Pete. - Never thought you did. Glad to have you back. - Thanks, Pete. - Winston's gonna have a fit if you're not reading the core books. - That's okay. You know, you should read it, Pete. - It's been a while, maybe I will. - I'm not fooled by you or your books! - We're on the same side, Carson. - Are we? - Hey, get these two to Winston's office! - I'm not finished yet! - Hold it! - You stay out of this, Pete! - I said, Hold it! Did you say "forks"? - No, uh uh, I didn't say forks! - No, he didn't say forks! (bright music) I think we should be quiet now! (gears clicking) (electricity sizzling) - Are all these pipes putting stuff in? - I'd be more worried that they're taking stuff out! (raider screaming) - We're not taking anything out or putting stuff in. We're just taking your pulse. - Lou, are we ready? - I'm not ready! - We're ready. - I said I'm not ready! - The location of your base, is it here? (dramatic music) (pencil scraping) How 'bout here? How 'bout here? - (screaming) I can't take it! I can't take it! I can't take it! They broke me. (sobbing) I tried, but they broke me! - I think we found the base. - They just broke into our house, now it's time to visit theirs. All boats, all crews, let's go! - All boats, Sir? Shouldn't we send a scout? - Pete, keep an eye on him. (engines puttering) - All right, you two, to the brig! (dramatic music) - You think they bought it? That'll be a wake-up call! (engine puttering) (dramatic music) - I don't feel good about this, Pete. - Neither do I. - Pete, drop me off there, will ya? - I'm gonna scout up river. I'll be back for ya. - Pete, it's a range marker! (cannons booming) Quick, turn around, it's a trap! - Turn the boats around, spread out! Turn around! (cannons booming) Turn the boats around! Get them turned around! - Pete, come on! (cannons booming) Pete! Come on, Pete! Pete! (crying) Pete! (cannons booming) (frogs chirping) (pensive music) - Wow, that was quite a nap! What'd I miss? - Eddie! (water trickling) - So they got 'em all, everyone? - Pete, Carson, then they must have hit the base and captured Lou and the rest while you were sleeping. (somber music) - It was the darts, nothing you could do about it. Probably, time to head up to Division. There's nothing for us here. There's raiders all over the city. We'll have to be prepared. (somber music) - You okay? - Just thinking about Pete, Lou, and Carson. Somehow it seemed like as long as the five of us stayed together, things were gonna be okay. - Yep. - It's for you, Lou. No, we're not doing this! We're not giving up! - We can't fight them on our own! - Carson and some of the others may have just been captured. If we could get 'em free, and with the raiders busy in the city, the base might be less guarded. - Alec, we cannot go upriver. - Eddie, I'd rather go down with my friends than retreat to Division. - Okay, Alec, there's a spare boat at the warehouse. - Let's do this, Eddie. (dramatic music) (tense music) (engine puttering) (frogs croaking) - You're quiet. - Bad memories. - You're not gonna have a flashback and lock up on me, are ya? - No, we've got a job to do. So after the first round of shots, I hit this? - Right, that'll give us a little more speed, not a lot. - Enough to get us under the guns before the second round? - Maybe, anyway, wait till I give you the word. (dramatic music) - Here they come, brace yourself! (cannon booming) Now? - Now! (cannon booming) Gentlemen, I believe I have something of yours! (cannon booming) (frogs croaking) (dramatic music) - Eddie, you keep your eye on them. I'm gonna go scout out the base. - What shall we talk about, gentlemen? - Eddie, the base, whoa... Eddie, what's going on? - Me and these boys are having a conversation. - Eddie, the base is empty! All the prisoners are gone. - I know that. - You do? - Since I brought the cannon over, these guys have been very helpful. You should know they've taken over the CDF. - The CDF? - Yep. - The raiders? - That's right, they brought all the prisoners, now they're shipping 'em out. - How long do we have? - Boys, how long do we have? A day, maybe less. - We'd better move it, Alec. (somber music) (dramatic music) (water splashing) - What is going on? - Some of the Force agents are holding out in the barracks and fighting back. We can't get in. - Make for sure they can't get out. They can't do any harm from there. Keep these prisoners moving! Yes, Sir, let's go! Keep it movin'! (door clicking) - I tried that already. It's not worth it. - What'd you find out? - The place is packed with prisoners. They're getting ready to move them. Carson and some of the others are holding out in the barracks. If we could get them free-- - There's gonna be a lot of raiders. - I got a few ideas. We're gonna need some supplies. - And hopefully a good plan. (dramatic music) - Come on, Eddie! (men groaning) - This was a terrible plan! What were you thinking? (crossbow clicking) - Eddie! (gentle music) - Someone's coming! Help me move this stuff. - Pete, Pete, you made it! I can't believe you made it! - It was just a cannonball. - Hey, Lou. I'm sorry, guys, we tried. - Tell me the two of you did not just charge the base! - It seemed like a good idea at the time. - It seemed like a good idea? What could you possibly have been thinking? - We were thinking, how could we get to the barracks. (dramatic music) - So you meant to get captured? - Eddie. It seemed like an ideal location to strike at the raiders. And these should get us started. - We're gonna try to retake the base? - We have bigger plans. - Sir? - What is all that noise? Where's the lieutenant? - CDF somehow got a crossbow and tried to retake the base, but we put 'em down. Lieutenant's making sure it can't happen again. - Good, split 'em up and ship 'em out. - We've got bigger problems. The routes we're using to ship out the prisoners to the other bases have been compromised. - No one even knows the locations of those bases. - The last two shipments of prisoners have been intercepted by CDF. Someone must have talked. (tense music) - When we're finished, send in Winston. - Winston? - In the other room, working on plans for our next attack. - We need secondary routes. - Here, down here and there. Double the number of guards, and then set an ambush for their ambush. That ought to be a surprise. - So will this. Thank you for your help. It would have taken us months to find those locations. (crossbow clicks) (dramatic music) - It'll save us from having to listen to a bad guy speech. (clock ticking) - I've got one for you. Raiders running all over the city. CDF agents going down. Chief turns out to be working for the raiders. How do we approach it? - I don't know what you're talkin' about! - Ran into an interesting person among your prisoners, Roberts? - He's from Division, and had a lot of information, about you, and about the replacement chief for New Haven. - The game's over, Winston. (crossbow clicks) (Winston moans) (somber music) - I never liked that guy, anyway. - Me neither. - I don't get how he got in this deep. - They intercepted one of our messages about promoting a new chief and slipped in their own guy instead. - He's been in a while. Don't know how we missed it. - I never thought about the boss goin' bad. - It's always important to make sure people are on the right track, especially someone in authority. - So who's the new chief? - It's Pete, promotion is effective immediately. (triumphant music) - Pretty hard to believe about Winston. - Good thinking getting the location of the bases. - Carson gave me a description of your sister. I'm pretty sure I know where she's being held. - You do? - We'll get her back. - Let's get these two up to Division. - Yes, Sir! - Lou, sign 'em out. - I've got men all along those routes. We'll be out before evening. (ominous music) - No, you won't. We're sending you via a different route, with a special transport. (dramatic music) (boat thudding) - I think it pulls a little to the left. - I'm guessing about halfway through the trip just making it to Division will start to look pretty good. - I'm not getting in there! You can't make me! - Load 'em up! - Gentlemen, I will be with you shortly. (gentle music) - It's good to be back as a team. - Yep, it sure is. - But it's not time to pat ourselves on the back. We got off track and almost lost the city. Alec? Lou, can you find copies for all the team? - Glad to, Sir. - It's time to get back to what's important. We could use another good man, Roberts. - I'll think about it. - If you join, this is invaluable. - Yes, it is. (triumphant music)
