You get on top. What? Come on. The second round is next week? I think so. Why sound so uninterested? I’ll take the exam. Ja-young, you are almost there. You just have to keep the pace this year. Right? Nothing sticks in my head any more. You want to keep this? You said you liked these big pockets. I’ll leave this here. Ja-young. You gotta have a life even if you don’t become a civil servant. Have a good life. Didn’t you go to school? What? School’s over already. Oh. The exam is over. Why is your phone still turned off? Why? Did Mom say something? She’s been all over the place since dawn. She says she’s too old to cook so she’s retiring from the kitchen. She always says she’s old. Your skirt is way too short. They call me Chopsticks you know. Kids with fat legs get mad at me. Mom wants you to come home. She says take what you want to keep. She’s throwing out everything else.

A lease would be better even if we need a loan, right? There is no need. You get housing too? Good. I didn’t take the exam. Speak up. My hearing is going in old age. I didn’t take the exam. Why? You know the English teacher’s girl, the one who studied French in college? She got a job with a PR agency. Should I ask her about job hunting? Mom. I’m too old to get a job. Nothing wrong with your age. I’m 31. They say a lot of late bloomers pass the exam these days. I said I won’t take the exam. So, you’re going to do nothing? You will be the death of me. Hey sis.

Hey, anyone can do this. Don’t let your elite college butt panic. Hello, Miss Oh. Hi. Good luck. Shall we get a bite to eat? - What should we eat? - It is lunch time. What should we eat? Noodles? How about noodles? How is it going? Yeah. It’s team lunch day. Come along. It’s okay, I’ll go on my own. It’s a free meal. When else will you get good food? Come on. Let’s go. Before we get started, let’s congratulate Eun-ji our new team member. Eun-ji. Thank you. I will do my best. How old are you, Eun-ji? I’m 24. Wow, 24. So you know Miss Oh? Pardon? I heard Miss Oh recommended you. Were you her junior in college? We’re friends from middle school. Friends? You did well today. Here’s your pay. Don’t you wire it to my account? You’ve never done odd jobs. The quicker the better. Go. If I don’t go home tonight, Jin-wook says he’ll cheat on me. Right. You’re still newlyweds. - Good night. - Bye. Min-ji! What? Didn’t you say it’s $50 a day? Huh? Did I say it was $50? Is this your money? Hey, don’t be like that. I need to go. How do you know her? I just ran into her a few times. I see. Is she any good? How long has she run? Complete beginner. This is Tae-sik and Min-ho. Hello. I’m Choi Min-ho. Hello. Welcome. You improve faster when you run together with others. I couldn’t even run 3 km before. You'll improve in no time. He lost a lot of weight too. Yeah, that’s right. I’m the youngest guy here. You can loosen up around me. Okay. Let’s start stretching! Put your hands under the chin, pull up your shoulders a little. Push the head back and count to 10. 9, 10. Now, put your hand on the head. Pull to the side and count to 10. Let’s go! Bye. There’s an online test project today. They want to know who can work overtime. There is overtime pay. I will do it. Me too. I’ll hand them the list. - Okay. - Good. Ja-young! Ja-young. Swing your arms further back. Arms? Yes! - Tired? - Yes. How much further are we running? Today’s run. The pace wasn’t bad. It’s amazing. You did great for running only for a few days. When I started, I only ran on the treadmill. Why? I just didn’t want someone looking at me run. It’s good to retie them before a run. The shoelaces go from outside to inside. Like this. To support the ankles. This way it doesn’t come undone. How long have you been running? About 7 or 8 years? I must be slowing you down. I’m happy that now I have a friend in the neighborhood. You must’ve done a lot of part-time gigs at an office. Sorry? You seem quite at ease. I always got in the way at first. I didn’t even know how to code. Gifts for your parents. - Here you are. - Thank you. I want some of that too. There are gifts for us too! - Wow! What is it? - Let me see! What is this? - You don’t want it then? - No, I’m taking it. What do you want to eat? Hyun-joo? Is something wrong? What time is it now? - You got work, right? - We have work too. Come on out. Hush, I can’t hear. I can come. Where are you? Not sleepy? I’m fine. If you get tired from running, stick close to me. As if you’re sucking my energy. It’s much easier that way. Isn’t it about time you paid for once? Considering you get paid the most. You are a manager. I’m just a newbie. You probably make more than our VP. Huh? Can’t find my locker key. Maybe you dropped it. Damn, I lose a half day off my vacation if I am late. Doesn’t your girlfriend live nearby? Don’t you have clothes there? It’s been ages since we broke up. Why? She looked hot on Instagram. Yes, but she didn’t like me exercising the entire weekend. Hyun-joo. Can I ask what you do? I work for a publishing house. Hyun-joo writes. Hey. She might really become a writer. You haven’t even read it. I can just tell that you are good. Stop it. Oh, my mind just went blank. Tae-sik, remember that Japanese writer? Why didn’t you eat first? You must be paying your rent on time. Your landlord hasn’t said anything. Yes. Can we have some water please? You look different. Lost some weight. I was always sitting down when I was studying. Here. I don’t know about weight but you look human now. Mom, you should work out too. That’s for you young people. What exercise at my age? I’m still young at heart, but my body has aged so much. You’re not that old, Mom. You still have a kid in middle school. Life is full of surprises. I never knew I’d have another kid in my 40s. So you should work out. I’ve even joined a running club. I would do something else if I had that much energy. Yoon Ja-young. Move back home. But I’m making all the payments. You think paying your rent on time means you’re fulfilling all your duties? Hey. I got this. Forget it. I make money too. Not very much. Here you go. Just a minute! It’s okay. Take your time. - Ja-young. - Yes. Are you done with work? It’s usually busy before a new book. Let’s go. Did you move in recently? No. Last spring? Summer? Moving again? Why? The place seems a little empty. I didn’t want clutter and got rid of everything when I moved. Ja-young, do you like to drink? Alcohol? Brewed a batch last week. Want some? You must really love alcohol. Even brewing your own. I exercise so I can drink. I want to have sex. Me too. Is there something you’d like to do? Me? I don’t know. I didn’t have a childhood dream. No, I mean during sex. Something you haven’t tried? Oh. I don’t know. You? What do you think it’d be like to do it with a man 30 years older? Why? Young men just want to show off. Asking to be touched here and there. It’s not fair. I’ve worked very hard to come this far too. My sex fantasy is doing it in a really expensive hotel. It’d be soundproof so I could probably be really loud, right? The bed would be huge too. Hey, that’s not a fantasy. I’d order really expensive in-room dining menus too. Eat nice food, then do it some more. I won’t have to think about anything. That’d be quite nice. Right? It’s hot. Yeah. Are you going to go out like that? Why? What if someone sees you? It’s just to the end of the corridor. Ja-young, hurry! What is it? It’s from a client and I didn’t tell the manager. Tastes great. This is the best. Have you finished the applications? I think 1,000 words is too much. Just have to make stuff up. I should retake TOEIC, right? You went to the best university in the country. You’re fine. Which team did you apply for? Marketing? What’s this? Internship. Internship? You get hired full time after a two-month internship. The newbies are 24. How can I? That’s okay. I’m 26 myself. I’m 31. Oh, sorry. I really wanted this. Are you sure you know how to use it? I do have a concern. Feels like I’m skinning a flea for its hide. Try this too. You said you wanted it. What’s up? Someone you know? Huh? No. Should I try calling again? Did she say anything to you? Are you guys stalkers? I’m off. Let’s just run without her today. Hold up! Tae-sik, shall we slow down a bit? Ja-young. The key to my place. Have you been drinking? You’re staying the night, right? I have to go to work tomorrow. Stay the night. Hyun-joo, are you okay? Let’s go for a run. It’s past midnight. I often go running really late. It’s great with nobody around. But you’ve been drinking. I’m sober now. Tomorrow, let’s do it tomorrow. No, I didn’t exercise again today. Hyun-joo, do you still have the brew we drank last time? I wonder how much you need to spend to win the lottery. Lottery? You want to win it? And you don’t? I think it’d be scary. Like using up all your luck at once. Isn’t it good to be lucky at least once? Ja-young. Do you want to read my novel? Is Hyun-joo not coming today either? It’s weird. She’d skip work but never miss a running session. Aren’t you worried? Well, people burn out from time to time. There she is. Look who it is! Long time no see. You put on weight. Don’t exaggerate. Ja-young. Yeah? Can I run behind you today? I’ll sap your energy if I get tired. Okay. See you later. Hyun-joo, how far are we going? Kang Hyun-joo! I’ll sap all your energy. Kang Hyun-joo! Hyun-joo. Hyun-joo. Life can be defined as before and after taking on running. Wear bright colors for night runs! Kang Hyun-joo funeral notice Min-ji Kang Hyun-joo Tae-sik, can a funeral be so quiet? I thought it suited Hyun-joo. How could everything be so calm after dropping a nuke on us? Feels like Hyun-joo would walk in. She’d come and just run in front of us. You saw with your own eyes and you still can’t believe it? It seemed Hyun-joo would never die. How could she have known she’d end up like this? Did she say anything to you? Well, she never talked about herself much. Which is why she writes. Where are you going? I understand how you feel. I too feel like she’s still alive. It’s weird. It just feels like she’s too busy to come. I’ve had too much to drink. Are you okay? What? You know, everything. Can you feel that? Getting these nearly killed me. If it’s so hard, why do you do it? I was always curious. I could feel something underneath, but your body is honest. You get exactly what you put in. I like that. Min-ji Why aren’t you picking up my calls? Are you sick? No. You should tell me if something’s up. Even if it’s a part-time job, you can’t just miss work. I told them you’re sick. But if you miss more days, I’ll be in a tight spot. I’m going to quit. Did you get a job? No. The intern application is due this week. Do I get the job if I just apply? Then, are you going to be a trainer? I’m not working out to be a trainer. Do you have something lined up? You don’t. Is applying for an internship there that big a deal? Oh, I’m sorry for making such a big deal out of nothing. I envy you. Because you live with no grasp on reality. Aspiring writers competition 2014 Pearl Buck memorial competition Kang Hyun-joo A photographer friend made me to do it. It’s great. You want to try? Me? No. Why not? It’d be something to remember you by. It’s great because it’s you. Sorry you missed study group. Didn’t know you applied because you missed work. Should we buy Miss Oh coffee? For opening the meeting room? Let’s get it together. Resume I see you went to a pretty good uni. Good luck with the interview. You too. Thank you. There’s some tension. Sorry? There’s some tension there, and they don’t read the cover letter. Please ask your questions for Ms. Yoon. Miss Yoon Ja-young? How was the interview? Once this is done, should I send it to the tech team? Yes. Let me help. I’ll quickly drop by home. Jin-wook is off to Beijing for work. I just need to help him pack. It’s okay. You don’t have to come back. No, let me help. I’ll be back soon. Hey. The carry-on is on the balcony. Min-ji? Why are you still here? I still have work left. You’re just a temp. I’m going to rest a bit in there. Hey. You’ve been with us for a while, right? Your name? Yoon Ja-young. Right, Ja-young. I should’ve treated you to dinner. Sorry that I’ve been so busy. I thought your interview was great. It’s easier for us to work with someone we know. It’s not all up to me but you wait and see. Here. What’s wrong? Don’t you drink? Wow. So you can drink. I work out so I can drink. I like that. It’s a shame that you can’t hang out with your boyfriend on a Friday. I don’t have a boyfriend. Really? You know what? Do you want me to set you up? What do you like in a man? Come on. You must have a preference. Oops, was that too personal? I like that you look healthy. How would you say it, that you give off good energy? I envy that. I like older men. - Mr. Ko Won-pyo. - Yes. - Ms. Hee-jung. - Yes. And Ms. Yoon Ja-young. And Ms. Yoon Ja-young.

There’s an important announcement. The recruiting process this year has changed. You’ll be reviewed after a month to be hired full-time. Prepare the final presentation while you work on your duties. You’ll be matched with a senior to ask for guidance on the presentation. What do your friends say about you? Sorry? How do they see you? Knowing the trend is quite important in this industry. You have no interest in that, do you? Ja-young. Yes? The final presentation. Be ready. Okay. Why are you so late? Why are you here at this hour? Let me stay over one night. Mom told you off? Mom is so weird lately. You know I go to three more cram schools now? How can a vice principal force so much private education on her kid? Even my homeroom teacher doesn’t tell me to study. You can tell Mom, but also tell her why I came here. I’ve got my own problems. Are you a pervert? - Going on a run? - Yes. This late? I don’t have time during the day. I won’t be long. Go to bed. Okay. - Not finished? - I’m leaving. Are you preparing your presentation? Yes. Going home? Yes. See you tomorrow. Hello sir. What’s wrong? My presentation is gone. Gone? Deleted? The company PCs are dodgy. You should have backed it up. No, just that file is gone. Why would anyone delete it on purpose? Ja-young! Ja-young. Sis! Let’s run together. Hwa-young, if you swing your arms like that, it gets harder. Hold on. Sis, I’m so tired. Let’s go home. Why? We haven’t run much. I can’t. Then go on home. I’m scared. Come with me. Go home. Ja-young! Ja-young, I put last season’s data here. Please organize it like I told you earlier. Okay. And when can I see your presentation? You got a lot on your plate already. You’re friends with Min-ji, right? For things like presentations, get some help. It’s okay to get a little help. I’m off. Another all-nighter? Yeah. Did you hear it too? No. I saw. I may be the source of the rumor. But I don’t know how it got around. It’s not like I went around blabbing. I only told my friend in Finance, but - she’s not the type to spread rumors. - Min-ji. You know, I still can’t believe it. How could you do such a thing? I know what you’re thinking, but it’s not what you think. Hey. You’d have made it even if you didn’t sleep with him. Manager Chung can’t make that decision alone, stupid. Why do you all think that way? What? That I slept with him for the job. Okay. To you, internship means nothing. So, you two are dating now? Formatting Hyun-joo. What do you think about when you’re running? What about you? What do you think about when you’re running? Enjoy, Mom. Why pay so much when you can eat at home? I wanted to treat you to something nice once I got a real job. Sure you can take a day off? Yes. You are full-time now, right? What? Your internship. You were hired full-time, right? Yes. Why don’t you take the exam while working at the company? What exam? The civil service exam? Civil servant is much better than being an office workers these days. It’d be a shame to let all that studying go to waste. Mom. What’s the longest you’ve ever run? How much did you run? At first it was so painful, I thought, if I can survive this, I can do anything. If you pushed yourself a little more, you’d spread your wings and soar. I feel bad for you. That’s all. Why don’t you come with us? It’s okay. Sis. Huh? Going on a run again? Yes, why? What? Is that weird? I think I’ll try running again tonight. See you. Categorized into social conflict, conflict management index, and... Categorized into social conflict, conflict management index, and...
