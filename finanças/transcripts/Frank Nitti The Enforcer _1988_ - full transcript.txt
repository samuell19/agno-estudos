What can you do? I'm a poor (speaking foreign language) and look, you have even lesser than me. - I have my name and my honor. - And that almost gets you killed no? - Maybe. But a man who's ashamed of his name is already dead and before I leave this life the men who did this to me will speak my name with respect. - Yeah and how you gonna make them do that? - For now I only worry how to show my thanks to you and your family. - There's nothing you can do. - Forgive me for intruding. I understand it is a personal matter but this ring that your son needs to marry, maybe I can help. I make it nice and hot for you. A man should be relaxed if you want to talk business huh? - Some kinds yeah. Depends on what kind you're thinking about. - Well all the time people ask me if they know where I can get a ring or maybe a watch but they don't got so much money so I tell them I don't know but then I think a business man like you, maybe you know what to tell me huh? - Maybe I do. - Yeah since business is so good and you come around all the time now I think, maybe I can work with you to help these people get what they need. That is if you think Jake won't mind. - Tell me something Frank, do you always hold a razor in your hand when you talk business? - Well maybe everybody pay more attention that way. (laughing) (light hearted music) - We're gonna have a little whiskey and we're gonna have a little fun, you know what I'm talking about here huh?

Let me see your face. - [Frank] You know who is this one Jake? - Cologne or something, Calzone, Capone. Johnny Torrio brought him out here from New York I think. Come on Frank we got customers waiting. (dramatic music) (light hearted music) - [Woman] Well hi, nice to see you, welcome. - Hi. (chattering) - The furniture may be used but it's comfortable as all get out. See anything you wanna curl up with? - Ah, no thank you, maybe later. I would like to see Mr. Capone I understand he works here sometimes. - Mr. Capone? Yeah Al slugs for us when some john forgets his manners or his wallet but I think he's kinda busy right now. - [Woman] You mean snoring don't ya? It was all I could do to get him off me when he fell asleep. - Well we don't have rooms enough for his naps when there's customers here. - Just a second if I could make a suggestion. (snoring) (water splashing) (screaming) - Just watch out! Where's my clothes? (speaking foreign language) I'll kill... - I did what you... - I'll kill them! Which of you (speaking foreign language) wants to die young huh? - I guess that must be me. - You! - The lady says in this place I can have anything I want for a price, I tell her I wanna meet Mr. Al Capone right now. I pay five dollars for this. You think maybe I pay too much? (laughing) - You know, I got a brother Frank too. So you've been there working for Jake since you come here from New York huh Frank? - Jake's a good man. He let's me have my business, if I need money he listens to me, Lou Greenberg too. - They do huh? That's good 'cause there's lots of brewery's for sale now. And Johnny tells me we should buy 'em too even if we gotta borrow some money to do it. - But Big Jim's gotta say okay no? - Yeah, he's the boss. What else you hear in that barber shop? - Well I know the boss is reaching to grab new territory. El Bania and Wise and Big Jim is right in the middle bud. - All he wants to do is play with dolls. You hear that too huh? - Hey Al when you're finished here I need to talk to you. - Sure, hey Johnny. - Yeah? - Say hello to Frank Nitto. - Sure. - Mr. Torrio nice to meet you. - Frank right? I'll be upstairs when you're through. - I'll be there right away. But first, we eat huh? You know it was some chance you took playing that joke on me. How do you know I don't just tear your head off? - I think you wanna make friends more than enemies. Besides I got a razor in my pocket in case you don't. (laughs) - You're alright Frank Nitto. (glass clinks) - Salute. (light hearted music) (opera singing) (thunder cracking) (knocking) - Hey Frank, cold out there tonight huh? - Yeah. - So how you doing? - Fine Al fine. You? - Great, great I'm just out walking you know. Lot of things happening. Look at this, you're good with the books and numbers too huh? - Ah it's easy when you learn. - Maybe I talk to Johnny and you come to work for us soon huh? We hear this next mayor wants to make things hot for us in Chicago so we're gonna move next door to Cicero take over and elect our own mayor. Won't that be something huh Frank? - Yeah it sure would. Would you like a drink Al? Jake keeps a bottle out in the back. - No, no thanks. - Is everything alright with you Al? - Look Frank, I think maybe you're a pretty smart guy like that joke you play on me. But I gotta do something now, I gotta take care of a guy Frank. - What kind of guy? - Somebody big, real big. I think maybe I do it someplace where nobody know, where nobody find him huh? - If somebody big was to fall then the world would have to respect and fear the man who brought him down but not if it's done in the dark. - So you say I shouldn't be afraid for people to know I'm the one. - If you have no fear to do it then you have no fear for your name. (dramatic music) - I'm real glad I come by to say hello to you Frank. We get together again real soon okay? - Sure. (dramatic music) - Extra read all about it! You'll want extras today. Big Jim got it! Shot to death in his own club. Best day I've had since they give me the route. The talk is the war's on now. (dramatic music) - Johnny and Al would like it very much if you would come and meet with them if you have the time. - Just give me a minute okay? (dramatic music) (radio chattering) (chattering) - 1129 North Halstead 8,300. (chattering) - I don't know why they get so excited we had this fight fixed since last week. - 115 Canal 7,600. - Hey Frank look at this. Al give it to me 'cause our takes been so good. They're real diamonds too. - Nice Finn, very nice. - 21 Rockland Stead 15,000. - After we go to the bank maybe we go see a movie huh? - Yeah okay, I like the movies. (dramatic chord) (whacking) (crying out) (dramatic music) - [Man] Come on! - [Man] Let's go, let's go! (dramatic music) - Charlie, you alright? Come on. Who were they? Who are they with? - I think I know one of them. He drives a truck for O'Banning. Donnelly they call him. - [Frank] Let's go. - Frank they were still out for us. Then we can go do another day. - I go alive you come or you stay I don't care. Drive! (dramatic music) - Frank just give you a will you make this. Frank! - [Man] Hey! (dramatic music) (whacking) (crying out) - The next time you try to steal from us O'Banyon make sure you put a bullet in my head first. (dramatic chord) Take the money Charlie. Take it! (dramatic music) Come on. (whacking) (crying out) (dramatic music) - Frank where ya been we got trouble. Al's brother Frankie was shot in a fight with some cops in Cicero. (speaking foreign language) - Yeah. Look we've gotta get to Al. (speaking foreign language) (dramatic music) (speaking foreign language) - I'll get them, I'll kill them. Get your gun. - Now Al calm down. - Give me your gun now. - Al, Al! (yelling) - I wanna a gun now. Charlie give me your gun. (dramatic music) - Give me your gun Al. I'll take care of everything for you. (dramatic music) - The war, it happens now. O'Banyon, Wise, Moran. We take 'em all down now it's the only way. - If we hit them bosses, then they'll come after Johnny. And if they get him, then you become the boss of the business Al. - We do what we have to now Frank, you set it up just no more crazy stunts like with that money. I need you too much to take chances like that. Maybe now you become the brother that I lose huh? (dramatic music) (suspenseful music) (guns firing) (suspenseful music) - Hey is this thing gonna be fixed-- (gun firing) (suspenseful music) (dramatic music) (booming) (dramatic music) - [Man] I hope the trip out from Washington wasn't too bad. - [Man] Everybody here? - They're expecting things of you because if we can't find a way to stop these open gang killings it's going to sink Chicago and it's gonna sink our investments right along with it. - I know the Wall Street boys have been phoning me steady for over a month now. Did you tell them about the fair idea? - A world's fair for Chicago to improve our image? We can take care of that, it's getting rid of Capone and his ilk. Now what about Hoover? What about the FBI? - It's a waste of time on this one. - You suggest something local and I won't even take you in there. Capone has got the whole damn city on his payroll. - No I've already arranged for a special prosecutor to come in from the capital. - What's his name? - Kelly, Hugh Kelly. Sharp fella, been trying cases for Internal Revenue. No connections so he doesn't have to answer to anyone but us. - Anything he needs, just let us know because we are determined to get rid of this murderous gutter trash whether or not you remain vice president. You understand me Charles? - Yes. - Correct me if I'm wrong. Wasn't today Kelly said he'd tell us how he plans to break the mob? - Uh huh. - Yes indeed it was Mr. Dallas. I apologize for keeping you all waiting but it isn't everyday that I'm asked to tackle a job of this magnitude so... Let me show you how we're going to destroy the Capone organization. - Newspapers? We're gonna bring down the Capone organization with newspapers? - Pair it with money, their money, everyone of these newspapers has at least two articles on some gangster who dropped a bundle on a new car or a race horse or a fighter and they can't spend the money fast enough and every time they do I want us to know about it and keep account of it. - You mind if I ask why? - Well if a man spends money in one way he's gotta earn it and then he's got to... The Manly Sullivan decision gentlemen. - Manly Sullivan that's income taxes isn't it? - No tax evasion right? - Felony tax evasion. - Yeah but income taxes that's annual that could take us years. - We have as long as it takes gentlemen. And anyone here who doesn't plan to stick it out should say so now. - Who we looking to go after first? - Capone right? - No, not Capone. Not until we know we can make it stick. - Then who? - Somebody powerful. Somebody close. Somebody important to him so it's only a small step up when we go for him. (laughing) - Hey Frank listen to this. These newspaper guys give us all names now. There's Paul the waiter Ricca. (laughing) Jake greasy thumbs Busic I guess that's cause he greased all those judges for us huh? (laughing) Hey they got you too, Frank the enforcer Nitti. What do you think of that Frank? - I think they're too stupid to even spell my name right. (laughing) - [Man] Hey what do they call you Al? - Scarface. (laughing) (speaking foreign language) That's not funny. Take this trash outta here I gotta talk to Frank. Go on beat it all of yous. The (speaking foreign language) make a man feel great huh Frank? - Yeah. - So how come you look like you just eat a bad meal? - Because of this war. I think we make too many enemies now not enough friends. - Moran's the only enemy I got left and I know you take care of him pretty soon too huh? Everything else is going great for us now, no? How much we gonna clear this year? - 40, 45 million. - Not bad for a couple of pisans who come here with empty pockets, am I right? You worry too much Frank. Take it to serious. No drink, no women. You need to have some fun. I find somebody for you to have fun with okay? 'Cause I wanna see you enjoy life Frank, like me. You just make sure I get to do it longer than Moran, huh? (speaking foreign language) (dramatic music) - There you are, I've been looking all over for you. - Al asked me to call for a doctor, I have to wait here. - But you said I could meet the new champ. Come on, take me inside to meet the champ. Hey. - What happened Frank? Somebody shoot somebody? - No, no, no, no just a cut up on the fighter. Al asked me to call you. He's up this way thanks for coming so quick. - This shouldn't take to long. - I see you come with the doctor. Would you like to come inside? - Oh no, no, thank you I'll just wait here til my father gets back. - Oh your father, the doctor. Sure no problem, he'll be back soon. (gentle music) Well goodnight. - Goodnight. (gentle music) - You know your father is a very good doctor, a great doctor. - Yes I know. - Well goodnight. - Goodnight. - Would you like something to eat? I could have someone bring it to the car for you no problem. - That's very kind of you to offer mister... - Nitto, Frank Nitto. - Anna, Anna Theresa Ronga, oh but my father and I we've already eaten, thank you. - Sure if you already eat. - But ah, perhaps another time then if... - Another time? - Well... - Great, great another time. Yeah sure, great. (gentle music) (knocking) - Hello Frank. - Hello. - But please come in, I just need another second to finish dressing. - Sure, sure, no problem. - Can I take your coat? You're welcome to sit in the living room if you-- - No, no, no I'll wait here, it's okay. - Oh thank you for all the flowers. - That's a lot of flowers. - Yes it is. - You know I told them to make it big but you know. - Oh no, no, that's alright really. It's fine. I mean thank you. - What? I arrange a table at the Wrecks. - Oh that's fine, I just need one second to change that's all. - Is there some place you'd like to go? - No, I mean you've gone to so much trouble I can change. - Please Anna just tell me where you'd like to go. - Well, I, I was just thinking there's this little place called Vitano's it's a few blocks away from here-- - Vitano's? I know Vitano's. - Really? - Yeah sure, I used to go there all the time. You get your coat, I'll be right back okay? Right back okay? - Okay. (gentle music) - Hey Charlie, give me your overcoat quick. - [Charlie] What? - Switch over coats with me. Then I want you to use the table at the race club take a friend, have a good time. See ya later. - Hey what about you and the doc's daughter? - We're going to Vitano's. How about that? She only wants to go to Vitano's. Hey and next time don't send her so many flowers, you embarrassed me. (upbeat music) No, no, no Anna everything's fine. I just have some business to take care of today. What? No, no, I didn't forget Valentine's Day. I have reservations at a little restaurant tonight by the lake. I pick you up at eight o'clock. (guns firing) (dramatic music) It's done now. You kill Moran and all the others. - Moran wasn't with them. - What are you telling me? - We got the Gozamberger's, we got Swimmer, we got Wineshank, we got-- - Moran! I sent you to get Moran! You cut off the arm but you let the head live! - He wasn't there! We looked for him I swear it! - Basta you killed for nothing! I sent you to get Moran! (whacking) (crying out) - Hey Frank come on let's go. We gotta get out of here. Come on let's go. We gotta go come on let's get out of here. Frank come on, come on listen to me, let's go. Let's get outta here come on. (dramatic music) - Appears our advisory's have exceeded even their own need for headlines. - Oh speaking of that. What do you want us to do with that hot dog Elliot Ness they just upped to prohibition squad? - You mean the one who can't drive around the block without getting some reporter to write about him? - We're never gonna get Capone by closing down a handful of his stills. So long as he doesn't get in our way we can let this Mr. Ness make all the noise he wants. As for our work I'd like you to consider this next question very carefully. In spite of all the long hours and the hard work of this investigation, do you really think that we have enough evidence to indict and convict Frank Nitti? - More than enough. - Oh very well then. Perhaps it's time for us to make some headlines of our own. - We put seven men in the ground and Frank gets indicted for tax invasion. I never even hear of tax invasion before and now you come to me and tell me you can't fix Frank's case? - What about the money we gave you to spread around Washington? - Anybody who could help wouldn't touch it and the ones who took it, well couldn't do much to help. - And all the judges and politicians we got on the payroll, they can't do nothing? - In Chicago sure, but this is coming out of Washington Al and the people behind this are already too rich to need the money and too big to scare off. - Nobody bigger than us! You understand that! Nobody! - I know Al. But the best we could do is to work out a deal. - [Frank] What kind of deal? - If you plead guilty to the tax evasion charges you'll only be sentenced to 18 months. With time off for good behavior you'll only-- - You guys and your deals you make me sick all of you! Now get out of here before I forget myself and start breaking some heads! (speaking foreign language) Beat it! Jesus I can't believe this Frank. Who does this to us? Who are these big people? - The people who owned this country before we get to it. - And who tried to stop us before we owned too much huh? - So maybe it's time I take Anna and we go home. - To Italy? But then maybe they never let you back in the country Frank. No. I'm gonna need you here. Who else can I trust like you? - But if I go to prison, what about Anna? Suppose she won't marry me? - Please, Frank we need you. - I understand. If this is what you ask of me then I must do it. But I think it's a mistake. - Why a mistake? - Because if they see me go to prison it will give them the courage to look higher and as much as they want me Al they will always want you more. - You don't worry about me Frank. I take care of myself alright huh? (dramatic music) - I know you wonder why I don't ask you to marry me. - It's because I was married once and I'm almost divorced I understand Frank-- - No, no, no that makes no difference to me Anna, no difference at all. - Then why? - Because I wish to spare you the shame of... Of a husband who goes to prison. - You're going to prison Frank? - Soon. For a year maybe more. - Then you should know that I would feel no shame to be your wife, no matter where you were, no matter what you did. - You'd wait for me? - Yes I will wait. But Frank before we make this promise there's something about me that you should know. - I told you that doesn't make a difference to me-- - Please Frank listen. My first marriage ended because my husband wanted children and I could not give him any. And if I were to be your wife, I couldn't give you children either. - Then we don't have children. Maybe we adopt, whatever you want. - You mean that? You could want me even now? (gavel bangs) - [Man] Court is now in session Mr. Birillo are you ready? - Your honor at this time if it please the court I would like on behalf of my client Mr. Frank Nitto to enter a plea of guilty. (dramatic music) (chattering) (gavel banging) (dramatic music) (radio music) - [Reporter] We interrupt the Favorites Melodies Hour to come to you live now from the federal court house in Chicago where that notorious gangland figure known to millions as Scarface is about to be sentenced for his recent conviction on charges of income tax evasion. We've also been told Chicago mayor Anton Cermak is in the courthouse today and we're trying to get a statement from him... Wait there's a commotion coming from the courtroom now. People are shouting and yelling. The doors are opening now, reporters rushing out to call their editors. Excuse me sir can you tell us what the judge gave him? - [Man] 11 years, the judge gave him 11 years. (speaking foreign language) - You heard it hear folks, 11 years. We'll try to verify that. Oh but here comes Scarface himself leaving the courtroom now. (yelling) - Listen to me! You can't keep me outta prison and you see to it I don't have to go until Frank gets out! You use them stays or them delays or whatever you have to but Frank comes back before I go you hear me? (yelling) (clattering) Now get outta here, out! Get 'em out! Frank this depression is a terrible thing to happen but we got free soup kitchens for our own now huh? - All over the city. - And milk from our dairies free for the children? That's good, you do a good job there Frank. Pretty soon we have to give the booze away too huh? - I think soon they have to repeal that law and prohibition'll be over. - Then you're gonna have to find a new business for us to have Frank before those big people try to push us back down into the gutter. - If there's enough time. - Listen Frank I know it's over for me and you, you have to be the king now. - I don't think I'm meant to be the king like you Al. - Then you teach yourself to be one. No more taking orders from anybody. You think like a boss, you talk like a boss, you be a boss or our enemies'll cut out our hearts and feed them to their dogs, you understand? - I understand. (speaking foreign language) - [Man] Here he comes now come on! - [Woman] Here he comes! Get a shot of him Johnny. - [Man] Let's go. (chattering) (dramatic music) (fire crackling) - You don't like the ring? - Oh it's a beautiful ring. - Then you don't like me? That's okay. I'll tear up the license and you can go marry somebody nice. - Frank. - What's wrong? Tell me. - You wanted to get married in the church didn't you? But because of me we had-- - Anna. I'm sorry for the church. They could not see such a beautiful bride. (dramatic music) - And I promise the people of this great city that we would drive the gangsters from our streets. With the conviction of Al Capone we've kept that promise. And we will continue to work against these hoodlums til Chicago is free of their vice, corruption and murderous methods. - [Man] One more shot Mr. Mayor. Ah great sir, thank you so much. - [Man] Thank you Mr. Mayor. - How'd it sound in here Ted? - Made me think about going straight Tony. - No money in that. Drink? - Think it'll taste as good when it's legal again? - It will if my friends are the ones who are making it. The fact is Ted, I should try to hand up somebody's head before that straight arrow Hugh Kelly makes us all look bad. - With Capone gone, I'm betting his territory's up for grabs. - And even better if it fell to you than those Italians in the first ward. How do we do it? - Take out Nitti. That way you get to go on making speeches clear through to next election. And before the rest of Al's boys can figure out who's running things, I'll step in and take over. - You know, all of the things I do in my life I never sweat like this. - It's a boy. - And the mother? - Oh it's always hard when they're too young but she'll be fine. Yeah, oh but hey I can't stand here and hold him for the rest of my life can I? (laughs) - Oh a father should hold his son. You take him Frank. - We should hold him together. (speaking foreign language) (dramatic music) - There you go. And don't forget, hey, you've got to give him a name too. - We could call him Frank. - No, no, he should have his own name. Maybe, maybe Joseph. He looks like a Joseph don't he? - Joseph, that's a good name, that's fine. Picked out a good name for him. - Hey Sargent, Sarg. Detective Harry Lang. Come with us will ya. We may need some help inside. - I thank you from my wife and my new son. Thank you. - Alright boys this is a raid understand? Alright everybody face the wall. Come on everybody hands high let's go. Let's go. - Callahan, take him and come with me. - Come on. Move it. (dramatic music) (chattering) (dramatic music) - Alright in here. Hold him up against the wall and search him. - You heard him up against the wall now! (dramatic music) He's clean. - Okay then, step aside. (dramatic music) (gun firing) - Holy mother of God. (dramatic music) - Why you do this? (dramatic music) (gun firing) (dramatic music) - We got a tip there was something shaking up here. What happened? - A little gun battle that's all. Me and Nitti. We come to raid the place thought we had it too when Nitti pulls a hideout gun from somewhere takes a shot at me. But I got him back for it. He's in there. - One side boys. (chattering) - [Man] Time to call the meat wagon for this one doc? - Better make it an ambulance. He's still breathing. (chattering) (speaking foreign language) - It's a friend. (mumbling) - What's he saying? - That he had no gun. He shot at no one. Please call Anna for me and tell her to hurry would you? - He's supposed to be dying. Can't we do something to finish him off? - While he's still in the hospital? - We couldn't even get close. - Are we supposed to just sit here and do nothing? - The state attorney could charge him with the attempted murder of Lang but that could get tricky. That other cop, Callahan? He said he won't back our story in court. - What the hell is happening here? He's a Chicago cop isn't he? Make him back it. - Weren't you thinking about going to Florida, try to see Roosevelt on behalf of our unpaid teachers here? - Are you saying that I should leave town? Turn tail and run? And let people think that I'm afraid of that little bastard? - Well, are you certain these men are the (speaking foreign language) who do this to me? What else? - The DA is charging you with attempted murder on the cop who pulled the trigger. You say the word Frank and we do more than make an attempt on him. - I want the bosses. Cicero and Mike went to Miami? He'll have to run further than that. Find someone there, tell him his family will be well cared for if he does this service for us but see to it that when Anton Cermak comes back to Chicago he comes in feet first. Charlie take care of the one up here and thank you all for coming to me like this. Your loyalty will not be forgotten. - Your life is our life. - There is no life except by death. (dramatic music) (gurgling) - Hey Ted I see you're still wearing that diamond belt buckle that Al gave you. Well don't worry you can keep it. (dramatic music) - [Radio] Miami welcomes president elect Franklin Roosevelt accompanied on this proud occasion by Chicago mayor Anton Cermak. FDR is speaking in Bay Front park when... (guns firing) (screaming) Five shots ring out. Pandemonium reigns, secret service agents wrestle the gunman away. Roosevelt is safe but tragically the shots have hit Anton Cermak. All Chicago mourns the passing of their beloved mayor as he returns home to his final resting place. - Now a lot of the places we bankrolled started short changing us on their interest. And maybe 20, 30 places stopped making payoffs at all. - They think since I went to prison, I get shot and going on trial soon that maybe it's okay to forget us huh? - And maybe if Cermak wasn't enough a few of them turn up in the river maybe we could change a few minds. - No, if you have to kill a man you make enemies with his family forever and a dead man can't pay you anything. (laughing) You lose your friends and your money. It's better that we send them a message that to forget us is to become our enemy. Paul, I want you to call our friend Jimmy Bocastro and tell him we have some work for him. Tell him to make his fire crackers loud enough to wake the dead but not so big that they should force a business to close or hurt anyone. Understand? - Right. (booming) (dramatic music) - Yeah, yeah bite the watch. Bite the watch oh yeah. - Frank. - Anna not now, can't you see I'm having a big meeting here? - And I suppose you're going to court half dressed this morning huh? - Why not? I never tried that before. Maybe they think I'm crazy and let me go huh? - They have to let you go this time Frank. But I never will. (horn honks) That must be Charlie with the lawyers, I tell him you're almost ready. (crying) - So what? You wanna be the boss? Everybody wants to be the boss. But not for you. You hear me? No more bosses in this family. - And now detective Sargent Lang, would you repeat for us the testimony you gave to the grand jury as to how one Frank Nitti drew a hidden gun and shot you in the hand when you and detective Miller attempted to raid his illegal place of business at 221 north La Sale street. - [Man] What's, what's his problem? - Detective? - No. - [Man] He's reneging on his testimony. - No what detective? - No I won't repeat the testimony. - You swore this under oath. - I don't care. I don't remember what happened or how I got shot. - Your honor we move for an immediate dismissal of the charges on the grounds of insufficient evidence. - [Judge] Motion granted. This case is dismissed. (cheering) (dramatic music) - I didn't even have time to go home to shower. Thank you for coming Mr. Nitto. I'll make this real simple. We're here to beg for our lives. - We know what we did and what you're probably gonna do about it but-- - Your deaths, would change nothing, you were just soldiers doing as you were told, I understand that. The men who sent you have already met their fates. It's over you have nothing to fear from me. Now if you'll excuse me. (dramatic music) (upbeat music) And since 1929 when Al brought us all together from our own cities from around the country to work in cooperation. Much has changed. Now that alcohol will soon be legal again we must concentrate our efforts on controlling it's distribution. This means investing our funds in hotels, restaurants, saloons and retail liquor stores all on a national level. - But we may not be able to serve only our own brands. - That is very true Mr. Landsky. And that is why we must expand into a new area of business. - What area of business? - Organized labor, unions. At first we will seek to control the unions of the places we already own, the bartenders and the restaurant unions. Then we will seek to control or influence the entertainment unions, nightclub acts, musicians at first-- - Bartenders I understand but why entertainment? - Gentlemen, the country still suffers from a depression. The people are hungry for diversions. If we act soon we can feed on that hunger for years to come. Now I have already made arrangements with a Mr. George Brown and a Mr. Willie Beoff who I am led to believe have considerable influence in the international stage hands union. Now I think this is a good place to start. What do you think? - I think leaving you in charge was the smartest thing that Mr. Al Capone ever did. - We got the word yesterday. George Brown has been elected president of the international alliance of theatrical and stage employees. - Elected my foot, it was a mob setup from the word go. - We underestimated Mr. Nitti, tax evasion won't work anymore if we're not careful this move into the unions will cement his organization in so deep we'll never get it out. - Great so what do we do? - Start digging again. Look into all their union activities, stay on top of this Brown and that other one Beoff, find a weak link who can give us inside information and ah... - And? - Pray, pray we get lucky. (door bangs) - [Anna] Oh Frank, Frank we're gonna be so happy here. - [Frank] I'm glad you like it. Go on, go have a look around. - Oh Frank. - [Frank] I got a new stove, a new refrigerator, all kinds of nice things for you. - Oh Frank, Frank I just love it. - I've talked to the board of the local union I don't think they'll let you put one of your people in. - Then you haven't made them understand. Either we will come into the bartenders union or they will find you in an alley somewhere with a bullet in your head. Now is that what you want? For your wife to wear black? - But you don't understand I-- - Then go back and tell that to your board! If you can stay off the booze long enough. Understand? - Yes. - That's the third time you warned him Frank. Now we should just go ahead and kill him, now. - There isn't time. Without him it would be years before we could elect a president to the international. You will see, they'll come round. Tell Beoff and Brown to come in now. - It worked like a charm, just like you said. - We told the theater owners we'd pull every projectionist in Chicago out on strike if they didn't come up with the cash, when the balked we pulled them out on strike. - That lasted exactly 15 minutes. - Today they couldn't wait to pay up. - How much money? - $340,000, in a little over a month but there could be a million in this maybe two million. - Let's just stick to the strategy and let the money take care of itself. And George I want you and Willie to go to New York now. Then if it works as well there, I want you both to make plans to go to Hollywood. - Hollywood. - Soon, we will want a hand in the unions that make movies. (upbeat music) Joey sit still. Come on you'll see your pop's still a good barber. But not if you keep squirming like a fish huh? Come on. (glass tinkles) Anna? (glass smashing) (dramatic music) Anna? You alright? Anna what happened? What's wrong? - It's my stomach, it's been hurting so much it's now a cramp I'm scared. - Okay, okay you don't try to talk. We'll call your father right away find out what it is. You don't worry honey. (dramatic music) - Frank. The tests have come back. Anna, she has colitis fibier. - This colitis is serious? - Yes. - But there's something you can do no? - Things we can try to do but... - But what? - Any other cases I've seen like this... I've got some other patients to see. I'll check back with you later okay? (dramatic music) - That reporter from Hollywood Pegler? The one who thought he recognized Beoff from the old days? Well he was right. Beoff used to push a stable of hookers on Halstead and there is an outstanding conviction against him for pandering. - Beoff served the time? - He was sentences to six months, must've greased somebody's palm 'cause he only spent a week in the stir. - That's great you find out how he slipped out of it, I'll find out how to pry him open with it. - Two times I sent George Brown with instructions for you, two! And two times you disobeyed me! You act like you become a bigshot in Hollywood all by yourself. We put you there but maybe your forget that huh? - No, no it's not like that. I didn't know that George was speaking for you, it's a misunderstanding. - Enough! Leave us to talk alone. - I don't think we should kill him. - I don't trust him. He drinks too much, he talks too much we don't need him. - So we'll send someone out to the coast to sit on him. Willie can't hurt us. - I don't understand. You wanted to kill McClain but you wanna let this one go. - And I was right. McClain's talking to the feds. - How do you know this? - I got somebody in the union. - [Frank] And you're certain of it? - I will be. - Okay. We can find out about McClain, Beoff can go back to Hollywood but you are responsible for him now, and any problems he makes (speaking foreign language)? (speaking foreign language) - How's our girl today? Joey picked some flowers. - It's good that you have come Frank. Anna she's very weak now. - Charlie take Joey for a walk. - [Charlie] Come here Joey, come with Uncle Charlie. (dramatic music) - Anna. Anna. - Frank. - What am I gonna do without you? - Faith Frank. You must have faith. Both you and Joey now. There's no vision without faith. Frank. - Anna. (dramatic music) Anna. (dramatic music) Anna. (dramatic music) - Why did you want to meet us here now Aber they're not even serving food yet. - You're here because this is where I told them to bring you. We don't want anyone seeing you leave our offices. - Your offices? Say what is this? - Sit down Mr. Beoff, this is a courtesy we don't usually offer. The unalloyed truth gentlemen. You have both been convicted of extortion, conspiracy, racketeering in the Hollywood unions and by all rights you should serve the rest of your life in prison. - Then why waste your breath on us now? - Because we don't want just you. We want Nitti and Ricca and the rest of them. And to do that we're prepared to offer you a choice, you can either turn state's evidence against them or leave for the federal penitentiary first thing in the morning. - McClain refused to testify didn't he? I heard they threatened to send his wife back to him in pieces. - McClain wasn't a convicted felon. - So what if we agreed to help you? - Your sentence would be suspended. You'd be free men. - Well this is a lot to think about here. How soon before you need an answer from us? - You can have 10 minutes. - What's he talking about? 10 minutes. (chattering) - I hope for your sake chief you haven't been skimming the books. - Why is that Lou? - Mr. Nitto's here. - You've done a very nice job running the place since O'Brien, left, very nice. - Thank you. - I think you're probably the reason it ran so well even when he was here but I didn't come to talk business. About six months ago, I lost my wife. - Yes I know. I was very sorry to hear about that, we all were. - But I, I have my son Joseph, he's seven soon. A child needs a mother. - Mr. Nitto, I-- - Please, let me finish. I think for a week now how to say this and if I stop now I'm afraid I'll lose it all. I only know you through your work and I have always thought well of you. And because you work for us, you know what I do and what I am. - Mr. Netto, are you asking me to marry you? - Yes Miss Canwerta, I know that we would have to spend sometime together and you will have to meet Joey to see that it was right for everyone. You would not, have to be a wife to me in every way, but that is my intention. For us to marry. - I'm flattered. Really. - But you, you need sometime to think about it. I understand but don't be afraid to say no if that's how you feel. I realize this is not an ordinary thing I ask. - I will give it some thought the fact is I'll probably be able to think of little else. - Joey what do you say to some popcorn huh? Two popcorn's please. - Frank I'm sorry about this, it's Sunday and all but-- - What's happened? - Joey why don't we go find some seats the news reels starting. - Okay. - Be right there okay? - Lloyd told me to track you down pronto. It's Kelly. He got Beoff and Brown to turn states evidence. The lawyer thinks they've been singing their heads off for months now. - Okay. I want you to call everybody together for a meeting at my house tonight. - Okay. - Why do they have to charge us all? Why can't one of us take the fall for everybody? - You will never understand will you Paul? This is not some Gmen with a tommy gun looking to make headlines, the feds want to charge us with the conspiracy, for that they have to move against us all. Or maybe, maybe you think my head will be enough to satisfy them eh Paul? - Al did it for us when the time came. Why not you Frank? Are you better than us? Are you better than Al? - And you Paul? You forget that it was you who insisted that we let these scum Beoff live. Oh no you forget that, just like you forget everything I've done since I went to prison has been to protect our business from the Hugh Kelly's who seek to destroy us. Even from within. Now that we are bigger, richer, stronger easy to forget eh Paul? Because right now, what you want is to be the boss huh? - Hey you watch yourself Frank. See you don't push me anymore, you understand? You don't push me. I'm warning you. (dramatic music) (door bangs) (dramatic music) - Paul speaks alone but I don't hear anyone speak against him, do I? We can meet again when the indictments are handed down. But now leave my house. (dramatic music) - If you're not gonna be needing me anymore tonight Frank I'm gonna head home. - Sure. Charlie. You got a gun? - In the car yeah, why? - I got a squirrel lose in the attic or something. Keeps me awake nights. I think maybe, maybe I gotta shoot him. - [Charlie] No problem, I'll leave it in your desk drawer before I leave, just be careful. - Thank you. (dramatic music) - [Man] He doesn't get many visitors since he get back from prison. - [Frank] I understand he's been very ill. - Let's just say syphilis isn't one of your kinder diseases. - Al. I come all the way to Florida to see you. - Frank is that you Frank? - Yes. The business has been, has been good, very good. But I think there's gonna be trouble now. - What trouble? - Trouble among ourselves. But before I raise a hand against one of our I think maybe maybe I should come and talk to you first. - Nobody makes trouble but me. I'm the boss remember? They want trouble I'll give 'em trouble alright right Frank? - Yes Al but ah-- - They call me Scarface! I'll tell that publisher to his face you can't call me Scarface. My mother reads that, my wife, my son. I want you to kill that publisher for me Frank you hear me? I want you to kill them all. Stinking newspapers! Lies that's all they write is lies. I own this city I tell 'em, me, Capone! (speaking foreign language) (dramatic music) - Mr. Nitto. - Father. - Is there something I can help you with today? - No, I just come to sit and think. - Of course, but if there is anything I can be found in the rectory. - Father. - Yes? - Do you think he knew? The crusades, the inquisitions, all the people that died in his name. When he preached his vision of faith do you think he knew about them father? - Why do you ask this question? - No reason. Goodbye father. - Goodbye Mr. Nitto. (morose music) - [Radio] Out of Morocco and Algeria. British and American troops under the command of general Montgomery continue pressure from the east across Eygpt and Libya combined allied forces now total over 200,000 men in an all out effort against the axis occupation of the Sudan. It is now evident that the victory at El Alamain October last was a definite turning point sending German troops reeling on the defensive across the barren desert sands. Last week Ronald field marshal of Hitler's Africa corp was recalled to Berlin defeated-- - [Kids] Infinitely perfect who made all things and keeps them in existence. Why did God make us? God made us to show forth his goodness and to share with us everlasting happiness and life. Who wanted us to gain happiness in heaven. To gain the happiness of heaven we must know love and serve... (dramatic music) - Hey! You there! (gun firing) Get down. (gun firing) (yelling) - [Man Voiceover] They just handed down the indictments. They named everybody. - [Frank Voiceover] Before I leave this world they will speak my name with respect. - [Anna Voiceover] Oh Frank we're gonna be so happy here. - [Paul Voiceover] Why can't one of us take the fall for everybody? Al did it for us when the time came. - [Al Voiceover] We do what we have to do now Frank. - [Charlie Voiceover] Your life is our life. (gun firing) (thuds) (dramatic music) (gun firing) (dramatic music) - Back early huh? - Yeah I stayed the whole night. - And you read that file Mr... - Graham, yes sir I did. Anymore news yet on the Nitti shooting? - He shot himself alright. - Well from what I read you as much as any could take credit for it. I mean no matter how you look at it, you won. - No I wanted Nitti to spend the rest of his life in a federal prison as an example, I wanted to put him and his kind so far into the light they couldn't live at all. - Well it's over now. He's dead. - There is no life except by death. - Beg pardon sir? - It's something he left us to think about like a mob that's as strong as it ever was. You still sure you'd like to work here young man? - Well to tell you the truth Mr. Kelly I'd like to think about it some more if I could. - It's all for the best I'm sure. Good day Mr. Graham. - Good day sir. (dramatic music) - [Man] There is no life except by death, there is no vision but by faith. Six members of the Nitti mob were brought to trial, each received a $10,000 and a ten year sentence. Three years and four months later all were granted parole. Paul Ricca returned to take control of the Chicago syndicate. Willie Beoff was given a new identity, in 1955 a bomb exploded under his car, he was killed instantly. (dramatic music) (MultiCom Jingle)
